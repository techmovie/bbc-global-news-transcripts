*01:09.040- 01:10.580* :  The news can be so heavy at the moment,
*01:10.760- 01:12.820* :  so I wanted to bring you this little gem
*01:12.840- 01:14.760* :  that I found on BBC Sound this week.
*01:15.080- 01:15.900* :  Just thought I'd share it.
*01:16.580- 01:17.820* :  It's called Happy News,
*01:18.400- 01:21.360* :  and it's made by the incredible team at BBC World Service.
*01:21.720- 01:23.800* :  Does what it says on the tin, it's just happy news.
*01:24.460- 01:25.440* :  Thanks to the shout out, Scott,
*01:25.440- 01:28.020* :  this is Andrew Peach, and this time we've got seals,
*01:28.020- 01:30.480* :  spoons, and a song about bees.
*01:31.120- 01:32.920* :  Hi, this is Morton in Copenhagen,
*01:32.960- 01:34.460* :  and you're listening to The Happy Pod.
*01:34.780- 01:36.340* :  This is Ira from Banglur,
*01:36.380- 01:38.140* :  and you're listening to The Happy Pod.
*01:38.520- 01:41.460* :  This is Seth, and I've got my fiddle here with me.
*01:42.620- 01:44.320* :  And you're listening to The Happy Pod.
*01:48.920- 01:51.920* :  On the way, scientists in Brazil working on a vaccine
*01:51.920- 01:53.240* :  for cocaine addiction.
*01:53.680- 01:55.660* :  Brazil is the second most important market.
*01:55.660- 01:57.360* :  The US is the first one.
*01:57.840- 02:00.120* :  In Brazil, we're talking about six millions
*02:00.120- 02:02.020* :  who use cocaine regularly.
*02:02.560- 02:04.200* :  The seals are in green limbs.
*02:04.220- 02:05.620* :  There are new types that's evolved
*02:05.620- 02:07.200* :  to make the most of the environment.
*02:07.600- 02:09.920* :  Glaciers, so the top layers of the short
*02:09.920- 02:13.120* :  are almost fresh water where the bottom layers are marine.
*02:13.660- 02:16.640* :  So we think that that is some specific genetic characteristics
*02:16.640- 02:18.080* :  that these animals have developed.
*02:18.640- 02:21.320* :  And there's a musical theme with Seth who went on tour
*02:21.320- 02:23.040* :  and walks between geeks.
*02:23.420- 02:26.440* :  We'd underestimate quite how long it would take us to get there
*02:26.440- 02:29.680* :  because we were walking 15 or 20 miles every day.
*02:30.040- 02:31.880* :  So there was a few days where we ended up
*02:31.920- 02:33.820* :  fell running, scrambling up the hills
*02:33.820- 02:35.720* :  to try and make it to the geeks on time.
*02:36.100- 02:38.880* :  And the Queen of Christmas defrosted online.
*02:39.160- 02:41.740* :  She leads up to it saying not yet, hashtag not yet.
*02:42.160- 02:44.080* :  She's been frozen for the rest of the year,
*02:44.520- 02:46.380* :  bursting out of that ice cube.
*02:46.860- 02:48.720* :  My 14-year-old had even seen it.
*02:48.980- 02:50.340* :  Those stories in The Happy Pod.
*02:55.520- 02:58.100* :  First, the Ukrainian refugee who says she's found
*02:58.100- 03:00.980* :  some light in the darkness after a song she wrote
*03:00.980- 03:02.420* :  and performed when viral.
*03:02.880- 03:05.100* :  22-year-old Helen Martiniok is a pianist
*03:05.100- 03:08.260* :  who settled in the UK after the Russian invasion last year.
*03:08.520- 03:10.640* :  And it was here that she tried out the electric organ
*03:11.000- 03:12.520* :  and then recorded a video of herself
*03:12.520- 03:15.440* :  playing her new composition, called the B-Theme.
*03:22.940- 03:25.960* :  It's been watched by millions, of course.
*03:27.020- 03:28.140* :  And Helen told James Reynolds that tune came to her
*03:31.660- 03:33.000* :  during a spontaneous moment of laughter and creativity.
*03:35.860- 03:36.060* :  So originally, I've made this composition for my colleague
*03:36.840- 03:37.440* :  because he works with the computer
*03:38.760- 03:38.860* :  and he always really concentrated.
*03:42.380- 03:43.060* :  And I just wanted to make a melody that makes him dance.
*03:43.060- 03:44.780* :  And you know, like a dance in mushroom, like up and down,
*03:45.420- 03:46.240* :  up and down.
*03:46.240- 03:48.920* :  And I've recorded the video and then I posted this video
*03:49.080- 03:49.600* :  and here we go.
*03:52.660- 03:54.720* :  I'm just talking with you about this.
*03:55.280- 03:56.160* :  Does it make you dance?
*03:56.640- 03:58.680* :  To be honest, all the time, my face just changed
*03:58.680- 04:01.440* :  and has like 101 emotions when I played,
*04:01.940- 04:04.260* :  especially because it's really repetitive melody.
*04:04.700- 04:06.860* :  It's easy for your brain to remember the melody.
*04:07.100- 04:10.040* :  This is probably the secret.
*04:11.340- 04:14.520* :  How have your fellow Ukrainians been reacting to the song?
*04:14.520- 04:17.440* :  Particularly those who are in Ukraine at the moment,
*04:18.660- 04:19.700* :  still part of the war.
*04:20.760- 04:23.700* :  This support was massive, like, especially for my family
*04:23.700- 04:28.900* :  because it really brings some good smiles in these dark days.
*04:28.920- 04:31.720* :  A lot of just Ukrainians who never knew me personally,
*04:32.220- 04:35.380* :  they were saying, honestly, Helen, that just made my day.
*04:35.380- 04:37.380* :  My day was shockingly terrifying,
*04:37.380- 04:39.840* :  but that just made me laugh a little bit.
*04:39.880- 04:41.360* :  So that also made me happy.
*04:41.360- 04:43.960* :  And my family, they're also still in Ukraine.
*04:44.800- 04:47.000* :  They supported me massively.
*04:47.380- 04:50.420* :  Probably people sometimes really need this light
*04:50.420- 04:53.200* :  and something good to laugh about it.
*04:53.720- 04:57.660* :  It feels like the kind of music that people are going to do videos to
*04:57.860- 04:59.020* :  and do their own dances to.
*04:59.360- 05:00.580* :  Have you seen anyone doing that?
*05:01.180- 05:02.540* :  Yes, I did.
*05:03.160- 05:05.460* :  And people started also playing this melody,
*05:05.460- 05:06.680* :  it was a shock for me.
*05:06.940- 05:10.320* :  And I even heard the person playing beat him in front of me.
*05:10.660- 05:12.300* :  And people singing this song,
*05:12.300- 05:14.560* :  you know, like, the person is like passing through
*05:14.940- 05:18.100* :  and like, just random people.
*05:18.620- 05:20.760* :  I've heard the person in the hospital,
*05:21.120- 05:22.240* :  he was singing this melody.
*05:22.940- 05:24.280* :  I couldn't move.
*05:25.020- 05:26.680* :  That was so impressed.
*05:28.120- 05:32.360* :  Is it a song that you think you'll ever get tired of hearing?
*05:33.680- 05:34.500* :  I think no.
*05:35.280- 05:37.180* :  Because all the time I'm coming to the song,
*05:37.400- 05:40.060* :  I literally played the melody more than 300 times,
*05:40.060- 05:42.480* :  because it just happens all the time.
*05:42.960- 05:43.840* :  I've never been tired.
*05:44.100- 05:47.460* :  Plus, I play the instrument, which brings me joy all the time.
*05:47.460- 05:52.380* :  Would you describe yourself as someone who is a person who's always happy like that?
*05:52.460- 05:54.900* :  Or are you a person like almost everyone else
*05:54.900- 05:57.480* :  who needs those moments of happiness to get through a day?
*05:58.400- 05:59.700* :  I'm a very emotional person.
*05:59.700- 06:01.800* :  So the beat theme is a big part of me.
*06:02.040- 06:03.360* :  I always smile and laugh.
*06:03.360- 06:04.960* :  So I would describe myself.
*06:04.960- 06:06.360* :  The beat theme is like me.
*06:06.940- 06:10.220* :  Yeah, even like now, I feel like I'm a beat theme,
*06:10.220- 06:12.860* :  because I'm smiling and my cheeks are sore already.
*06:14.420- 06:16.640* :  How since February 22,
*06:16.640- 06:19.100* :  the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
*06:19.280- 06:23.260* :  how have you managed to find those moments to smile and even to laugh?
*06:24.920- 06:30.060* :  I've been always learning how to find some simply beauty inside of the things.
*06:30.060- 06:33.420* :  This is why I started taking pictures on my old camera
*06:33.520- 06:35.440* :  because I wanted to fix a good moment.
*06:36.200- 06:37.360* :  And when the war started,
*06:37.900- 06:40.700* :  I realized that I've started losing everything.
*06:41.320- 06:42.680* :  And when I was sitting on my kitchen,
*06:42.680- 06:45.480* :  I was just having a few and everything is very pointless.
*06:45.800- 06:48.620* :  And I just decided to keep the balance
*06:48.620- 06:50.820* :  and started just playing the piano
*06:50.820- 06:53.000* :  to leave all the emotions, to keep the balance.
*06:54.400- 06:54.920* :  Simply things,
*06:54.920- 06:56.920* :  genuinely brings me a lot of joy,
*06:56.920- 06:58.440* :  like even the sunny weather.
*06:58.720- 07:01.520* :  It's the biggest reason to make me already very happy
*07:01.560- 07:03.460* :  and not think about bad things.
*07:03.460- 07:05.840* :  Helen, the time has come.
*07:06.440- 07:07.900* :  Would you please play us the beat theme?
*07:08.700- 07:10.000* :  Oh, for the pleasure.
*07:32.940- 07:37.320* :  Helen Martinioch and her beat theme.
*07:37.320- 07:39.640* :  We love stories from all over the world on the happy part.
*07:39.940- 07:41.920* :  I can tell you, this is the first time we've been to Greenland,
*07:44.360- 07:45.800* :  the world's largest island in the North Atlantic,
*07:45.800- 07:47.140* :  with its dramatic fjords and icebergs.
*07:47.140- 07:51.660* :  In a moment, we'll hear about a new type of seal that's been found there.
*07:51.660- 07:52.740* :  First, Akulu-Roshing-Aspiris,
*07:52.940- 07:54.240* :  a senior scientist at the time,
*07:57.120- 07:58.720* :  was the first time we've been to Greenland,
*07:58.980- 08:00.480* :  the world's largest island in the North Atlantic,
*08:00.680- 08:02.700* :  with its dramatic fjords and icebergs.
*08:02.700- 08:05.380* :  A senior scientist at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources
*08:05.760- 08:08.480* :  told me more about the landscape of Greenland and its uses.
*08:09.140- 08:12.340* :  One of the things that's special about it is you have this fjord.
*08:12.380- 08:14.320* :  It's about 60 kilometers long,
*08:14.960- 08:16.780* :  and it produces a lot of icebergs.
*08:17.420- 08:20.180* :  The icebergs have many shapes and forms,
*08:20.240- 08:22.820* :  and with many of those that comes out of this fjord
*08:23.040- 08:25.240* :  will be newborn icebergs.
*08:26.080- 08:27.440* :  During the next coming years,
*08:27.440- 08:30.940* :  they will change a lot, both in colors and in shape.
*08:31.660- 08:34.920* :  Nowadays, it's mainly fishing for Greenland helipad,
*08:34.980- 08:36.920* :  and that's just outside the fjord,
*08:37.260- 08:38.940* :  or some of the sight branches.
*08:40.340- 08:41.920* :  There is this main fjord, 60 kilometers,
*08:41.920- 08:46.740* :  and then there's some smaller sight branches of the fjord,
*08:48.080- 08:50.360* :  where people are fishing and hunting seals.
*08:51.360- 08:54.920* :  Researchers from across Scandinavia have discovered a new type of seal
*08:54.920- 08:56.920* :  that lives in Greenland's ice fjords.
*08:57.560- 08:59.880* :  Now, these seals look different from other ring seals.
*08:59.880- 09:03.300* :  They're bigger, and they have distinctive colors and patterns on their coats.
*09:03.980- 09:06.220* :  Local hunters have, of course, been aware of them for generations.
*09:06.220- 09:09.440* :  They call them kanghiat, meaning from kanghia,
*09:09.640- 09:11.740* :  the Greece landing name for the area in the West.
*09:11.820- 09:12.360* :  They live in.
*09:12.840- 09:14.920* :  Morphin Tanga Olsen is lead researcher of the study.
*09:14.920- 09:17.860* :  He's an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen,
*09:17.860- 09:21.760* :  and told me more about the difference between other seals and the kanghiat.
*09:22.640- 09:25.420* :  Ring seals are sort of all over the place in the Arctic.
*09:25.420- 09:28.620* :  It's one of the better and broader of the local population,
*09:28.700- 09:30.680* :  and I've been that for thousands of years.
*09:31.380- 09:32.620* :  From a scientific point of view,
*09:32.620- 09:34.840* :  we always thought that ring seals across the Arctic
*09:34.840- 09:38.360* :  was this big sort of panmetic group moving around,
*09:38.600- 09:39.780* :  interbreeding with each other,
*09:39.780- 09:42.920* :  not really a lot of sort of variation across their range,
*09:42.920- 09:47.920* :  but local hunters have long recognized different types of ring seals,
*09:47.920- 09:50.560* :  both in Greenland and in Canada,
*09:50.560- 09:55.620* :  and particularly distinguishing between smaller variants that were out in the packer eyes,
*09:55.620- 09:58.760* :  and then larger variants that tend to live in the fjord.
*09:58.920- 10:00.660* :  And in this particular fjord system,
*10:00.920- 10:03.920* :  the local hunters have referred to the seals as kanghiat,
*10:04.100- 10:05.920* :  so those coming from kanghia,
*10:05.920- 10:08.500* :  which is the Greenland name of the ice fjord.
*10:08.940- 10:11.060* :  So that have been known probably for generations,
*10:11.220- 10:15.220* :  but it's never sort of scientifically been investigated
*10:15.220- 10:18.480* :  how different those seals were from other Arctic ring seals.
*10:18.940- 10:20.700* :  And just describe what the difference is,
*10:20.700- 10:22.700* :  what's different about these seals.
*10:23.560- 10:26.200* :  So they tend to be larger and body size.
*10:26.400- 10:30.240* :  They have a sort of more distinct pattering in the fjord ring seals.
*10:30.760- 10:35.780* :  The name come from sort of ring-like white-ish rings on the coat,
*10:35.860- 10:39.160* :  but these ones tend to have a more distinct pattering,
*10:39.160- 10:44.200* :  more clear white yellowish brown dark patches.
*10:44.640- 10:46.580* :  Their behavior is also very different in that.
*10:47.280- 10:51.140* :  Other Arctic ring seals tend to migrate or move over thousands of kilometers
*10:51.140- 10:54.580* :  in search for food, but these ones stay in this fjord system.
*10:55.100- 10:58.220* :  And people listening away familiar with the idea of evolution,
*10:58.220- 11:03.220* :  of animals developing to be as in keeping with their environment
*11:03.220- 11:05.500* :  as possible to make the best of the environment they're in.
*11:05.740- 11:07.940* :  Is that what we're talking about having happened here, do you think?
*11:08.360- 11:11.060* :  Yeah, that's what we have publicizing.
*11:11.060- 11:14.280* :  We sequenced the number of genomes from these animals
*11:14.280- 11:17.640* :  and compared it to ring seals across their range
*11:17.680- 11:20.600* :  and could see that the striking also were genetically different.
*11:21.180- 11:23.920* :  And using different models, we could estimate that,
*11:24.200- 11:26.940* :  that they likely diverged more than 100,000 years ago,
*11:27.500- 11:29.920* :  may perhaps as long as 200,000 years ago.
*11:30.800- 11:34.700* :  And during this period, they have required some genetic characteristics.
*11:34.700- 11:39.820* :  And we also think we see the selection of genes that might be associated
*11:39.820- 11:41.640* :  with salinity tolerance.
*11:41.980- 11:44.300* :  So this ice fjord is quite unique in that.
*11:44.860- 11:47.740* :  There's a lot of fresh water runoff from the melting glaciers.
*11:48.580- 11:51.860* :  So the top layers of the fjord are almost fresh water
*11:51.860- 11:53.340* :  where the bottom layers are marine.
*11:53.900- 11:56.740* :  So we think that that is some specific genetic characteristics
*11:56.740- 11:58.340* :  that these animals have developed.
*11:58.740- 12:01.640* :  But the differences aren't great enough for it to be defined
*12:01.640- 12:03.920* :  as a new species of seal.
*12:03.920- 12:06.060* :  It's a new eco-type of seal.
*12:06.680- 12:08.920* :  It's a new eco-type of seal.
*12:08.920- 12:11.920* :  And obviously now we're down into semantics.
*12:11.920- 12:13.780* :  It's clearly not its own species,
*12:13.780- 12:16.940* :  but whether it's an eco-type or soft species or what it is,
*12:16.940- 12:18.920* :  that's mainly a scientific discussion.
*12:18.980- 12:21.920* :  But it's clear that these animals morphologically
*12:22.740- 12:25.420* :  in their appearance are different from other Arctic ring seals.
*12:26.400- 12:29.140* :  Morton Tanger Olsen from the University of Copenhagen.
*12:29.900- 12:32.920* :  A 17-year-old boy in India has developed a smart spoon
*12:33.020- 12:35.800* :  to help people with Parkinson's disease.
*12:36.440- 12:37.900* :  Arif Anil is from Bangalore.
*12:37.900- 12:39.920* :  He was inspired by his uncle Arjen,
*12:39.980- 12:43.880* :  who has Parkinson's and was struggling to eat because of his tremors.
*12:44.440- 12:47.380* :  So using sensors, motors and a 3D printer,
*12:47.760- 12:50.340* :  Arif's smart spoon is now undergoing trials
*12:50.340- 12:51.580* :  at a local university.
*12:52.040- 12:53.600* :  He told me what his invention looks like.
*12:54.080- 12:57.240* :  So the smart spoon which we have built is basically like a cylinder
*12:57.860- 13:00.440* :  and in the front of it there's a spoon,
*13:00.800- 13:02.040* :  which is attached to motors.
*13:02.640- 13:03.860* :  So when the hand tremors,
*13:03.860- 13:07.460* :  the spoon compensates for it by rotating in the opposite direction.
*13:08.180- 13:11.920* :  And this was inspired as an invention by your uncle.
*13:11.960- 13:15.820* :  Tell me a little bit about the battle that your uncle has with Parkinson's.
*13:16.640- 13:19.760* :  Around a year ago I attended a family function
*13:20.240- 13:21.920* :  where I saw my uncle Arjen.
*13:22.420- 13:25.840* :  He has Parkinson's disease and he was struggling to eat food.
*13:26.380- 13:28.520* :  So using a spoon he tried to pick up the food,
*13:28.900- 13:30.520* :  but all the food spilled over.
*13:30.880- 13:33.900* :  So he needed like a assistant to help him eat.
*13:34.520- 13:37.880* :  So Parkinson's is a disease where the patients hand tremors
*13:38.340- 13:40.600* :  and it's very hard for them to do simple household things.
*13:42.020- 13:45.840* :  So most people seeing that would sympathize
*13:45.980- 13:47.460* :  and understand the issues,
*13:48.180- 13:52.320* :  but not have the knowledge to be able to design a piece of equipment to help.
*13:52.760- 13:55.820* :  Tell me where that knowledge came from in you, Arif.
*13:56.460- 13:59.660* :  I was introduced to robotics when I was seven years old.
*14:00.080- 14:04.260* :  And ever since then I've been participating in more than 20 robotics competitions
*14:04.820- 14:08.780* :  and developing my skills on mechanical electronics and software.
*14:09.300- 14:13.620* :  So with these competitions I've gained a lot of knowledge
*14:14.120- 14:16.560* :  on the technical aspects of building a robot.
*14:17.100- 14:20.760* :  So we built around five prototypes and for each of the prototypes
*14:20.760- 14:24.220* :  we first designed it in CAD which is computer-aided design
*14:24.220- 14:27.900* :  and then we used a 3D printer to simulate and prototype it.
*14:28.680- 14:30.600* :  Did your uncle know that you were doing this
*14:30.600- 14:32.100* :  or did you keep it a secret from him?
*14:33.040- 14:36.120* :  For the first one to two months we kept it a secret
*14:36.560- 14:40.660* :  because we wanted him to be surprised after it is fully completed.
*14:41.300- 14:44.740* :  So the first time he saw it he was absolutely impressed
*14:44.740- 14:47.720* :  because he hadn't seen any other product like this
*14:47.860- 14:51.480* :  and he knew that this could have a big impact on him.
*14:52.400- 14:57.840* :  And what chances there of this being marketed and distributed
*14:57.840- 15:01.100* :  to patients around the world with Parkinson's?
*15:01.760- 15:04.640* :  Currently we have tied up with RV college of physiotherapy
*15:05.160- 15:07.320* :  and they are helping us with the validation
*15:07.320- 15:11.280* :  because any medical device before coming into the market
*15:11.700- 15:14.360* :  must be validated with a large group of patients
*15:14.940- 15:18.140* :  and they are giving us feedback and suggestions so that we can improve
*15:18.660- 15:21.240* :  and then we are thinking of small scale manufacturing
*15:22.080- 15:24.280* :  so that first we can distribute it among the hospitals
*15:24.280- 15:25.960* :  and then to the individuals.
*15:26.740- 15:30.120* :  Robotics innovator Arav Anil with me from Bangalore in India.
*15:34.960- 15:37.080* :  Soon we are off to China to meet the six year old
*15:37.120- 15:39.540* :  who can do a Rubik's Cube in six seconds.
*15:39.540- 15:41.500* :  On the social network way bow
*15:41.760- 15:44.800* :  users have spoken of how they couldn't solve a cube in six hours
*15:44.800- 15:46.060* :  let alone six seconds.
*15:46.740- 15:49.800* :  And there are many who feel that her young gauge means that she could eventually
*15:50.220- 15:51.880* :  claim the overall title in years to come.
*15:52.280- 15:54.540* :  And we will have some live fiddle playing if you stay with us.
*16:05.300- 16:08.600* :  Have you ever wondered what sets exceptional leaders apart?
*16:09.640- 16:12.180* :  Discover how renowned leaders from around the globe
*16:12.180- 16:16.400* :  have harnessed their natural talents to achieve remarkable success.
*16:17.540- 16:19.960* :  Uncover the secrets of leadership excellence,
*16:20.580- 16:24.100* :  one strength at a time, through gallops leading with strengths.
*16:25.100- 16:28.780* :  Dive into compelling stories at leadingwithstrengths.com.
*16:33.000- 16:35.740* :  Scientists in Brazil are working on a world first vaccine
*16:36.080- 16:37.860* :  to help break cocaine addiction.
*16:38.480- 16:41.720* :  It's hoped the drug could enter the global market within the next four years.
*16:42.280- 16:45.920* :  Professor Federico Garcia is a psychiatrist who's coordinating the project
*16:45.920- 16:48.680* :  at the Federal University of Minas Juris.
*16:49.380- 16:53.720* :  We have about 20 million people in the world who consume regularly cocaine.
*16:54.520- 16:56.720* :  In Brazil is the second most important market.
*16:56.720- 16:58.380* :  The US is the first one.
*16:58.940- 17:00.900* :  Cocaine is also a problem in Mexico.
*17:01.700- 17:04.740* :  Consumption in Europe also increased in the last years.
*17:05.180- 17:07.040* :  We're all familiar with the idea of vaccination,
*17:07.160- 17:13.280* :  but cocaine addiction seems a surprising condition that vaccination might be an answer to.
*17:13.520- 17:18.460* :  Vaccination in this case is a different approach than the preventive vaccination.
*17:18.560- 17:21.500* :  We're talking about a therapeutic vaccine.
*17:22.260- 17:25.800* :  What I mean by that, we already have this model for allergies
*17:25.800- 17:30.400* :  for example, where we use a vaccine to modulate the immune system
*17:30.400- 17:34.440* :  to not recognize so strongly an answer gen, for example.
*17:34.440- 17:39.860* :  We also have a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of bladder cancer, for example,
*17:40.520- 17:47.920* :  where it induce an antibody that will detect cancer and help the immune system to destroy them.
*17:48.700- 17:52.920* :  In fact, this mechanism was observed in the 80s by an American team
*17:52.940- 17:58.640* :  who was studying why some people increased the amount of cocaine that they use.
*17:59.260- 18:03.800* :  And they found that those subjects that used large amounts of cocaine,
*18:04.600- 18:07.560* :  they already had anti-cocaine antibodies.
*18:07.840- 18:13.100* :  So those antibodies, when they are in the bloodstream, they link to cocaine.
*18:13.720- 18:19.400* :  And if they reduce or precludes the passage of cocaine through a protective barrier
*18:19.400- 18:22.840* :  that we have in our brain, they met the blood-brain barrier.
*18:23.340- 18:29.860* :  This is a protective barrier that we have to avoid that via virus or large molecules pass
*18:30.380- 18:33.180* :  and damage the function of the brain.
*18:34.060- 18:35.800* :  Cocaine is a very small molecule.
*18:36.140- 18:41.340* :  So when it passes freely through this barrier, but when we have the antibodies,
*18:41.340- 18:45.020* :  they link to cocaine and they reduce this passage.
*18:45.640- 18:49.580* :  And you'd imagine that the next step along the road would be to do human throngles,
*18:50.280- 18:54.120* :  but a complication with that would be people being willing to come forward
*18:54.120- 18:56.780* :  and identify themselves as a cocaine addict.
*18:57.480- 19:01.660* :  Self-identification of the disease is something that is very common.
*19:02.200- 19:08.660* :  Since we started to deviate the vaccine, we have about 6,000 people that spontaneously
*19:09.580- 19:14.400* :  search to participate in the clinical trials.
*19:15.000- 19:20.700* :  I think there is a real demand for a new treatment for a cocaine addiction nowadays.
*19:21.640- 19:24.320* :  Professor Frederico Garcia with me from Brazil.
*19:25.020- 19:30.820* :  Now another musician who's gone viral this week with 160 million views so far on X
*19:30.820- 19:33.680* :  and 82 million on Instagram for this video.
*19:44.020- 19:48.600* :  The self-styled Queen of Christmas, Mariah Carey, has officially opened the season
*19:48.600- 19:55.320* :  by being defrosted from a block of ice by four people dressed in Halloween outfits before declaring its time.
*19:55.320- 20:00.160* :  Her song, All I Want For Christmas Is You, which earns her $2.5 million a year,
*20:00.500- 20:01.920* :  is already back in the charts.
*20:02.000- 20:05.280* :  Here's music journalist and Mariah Superfan Hanoverda.
*20:05.520- 20:10.240* :  I anticipated it because, of course, on the 1st of November, she leads up to it saying
*20:10.240- 20:14.440* :  not yet, hashtag not yet, but we all know when the Queen of Christmas declares
*20:15.000- 20:17.300* :  is what we need right now, and it is indeed time.
*20:17.300- 20:21.520* :  She's been frozen for the rest of the year, bursting out of that ice cube.
*20:22.060- 20:28.120* :  My 14-year-old had even seen it, which, considering she's my firstborn actually named after Mariah,
*20:28.980- 20:31.800* :  Mimi, she, they're loving her hair.
*20:32.240- 20:34.700* :  I think it's got something different, because it's really timeless.
*20:35.040- 20:39.160* :  I mean, it could have been released in 1963, as some people might say it was,
*20:39.260- 20:42.180* :  but it's been out for 29 years now.
*20:42.180- 20:45.020* :  And we don't forget, we only hear it for two months of the year,
*20:45.020- 20:48.420* :  so you can't really get sick of it, and it brings back all those memories,
*20:49.220- 20:50.880* :  and it's just a fabulous song.
*20:52.120- 20:58.220* :  A six-year-old girl in China has become the fastest female to solve a Rubik's Cube in under six seconds.
*20:58.860- 21:03.200* :  So she's Shane from Jiangsu Province, managed to decipher the three-by-three-by-three puzzle
*21:03.500- 21:08.600* :  in 5.97 seconds, as get more from our China media analyst, Kerry Allen.
*21:14.400- 21:17.900* :  What you are hearing here is the sound of a new world record being said.
*21:18.520- 21:22.740* :  This week, it's been announced that Chinese speedcuba, Towsishian,
*21:23.060- 21:28.280* :  has set the new women's world record for solving a Rubik's Cube in 5.97 seconds.
*21:28.980- 21:32.760* :  She's now the only female in the world to be recognized by the World Cube Association
*21:33.120- 21:35.520* :  as being able to do this in under six seconds.
*21:36.540- 21:40.420* :  And what makes this particularly spectacular is that she's only six years old.
*21:41.260- 21:44.700* :  Tsar's mother has told media this week that her daughter first became interested
*21:44.700- 21:47.200* :  in playing with a Rubik's Cube when she was three years old,
*21:47.660- 21:49.200* :  and she saw her cousin playing with one.
*21:49.880- 21:52.880* :  Ever since, she's been playing with one for two to three hours a day,
*21:52.880- 21:54.880* :  practicing getting faster and faster.
*21:55.800- 21:57.480* :  And her success has come as a huge surprise.
*22:01.920- 22:05.240* :  Truthfully, I felt like we were living in a dream for a couple of days
*22:05.240- 22:07.340* :  after returning home, her mother said.
*22:08.220- 22:10.980* :  We never thought that she would be breaking the world record so soon.
*22:11.980- 22:15.180* :  She said the record at the Rubik's Cube International Open in Singapore,
*22:15.900- 22:17.200* :  which took place early this year.
*22:18.180- 22:20.520* :  Her record is not the fastest time overall.
*22:21.180- 22:22.580* :  That was actually only setting June,
*22:23.080- 22:27.500* :  when 21-year-old American speedcube of Max Park claimed the Guinness World record.
*22:28.360- 22:31.180* :  He solved a Rubik's Cube in 3.13 seconds.
*22:37.280- 22:39.800* :  There's been a lot of praise for Tsar on Chinese social media.
*22:40.480- 22:44.920* :  On the social network waybo, users have spoken of how they couldn't solve a cube in six hours
*22:44.960- 22:46.360* :  let alone six seconds.
*22:47.020- 22:50.720* :  And there are many who feel that her young age means that she could eventually claim
*22:50.720- 22:52.220* :  the overall title in years to come.
*22:53.020- 22:55.360* :  Rubik's Cube's are very popular toys in China.
*22:55.800- 22:58.480* :  Before Max Park broke the world's speed record in June,
*22:58.480- 23:04.640* :  Chinese Prodigy Do You Shunk held the record in 2018 with a time of 3.47 seconds.
*23:05.440- 23:08.540* :  The Guinness Book of Records says that there are other Chinese Prodigies as well
*23:08.540- 23:10.500* :  that have burst onto the scene in recent years.
*23:11.340- 23:13.860* :  One to watch is 14-year-old Shuri Hung,
*23:14.360- 23:18.260* :  who has solved a cube on camera in a whopping 2.68 seconds.
*23:19.160- 23:21.540* :  But because he did not do this at the World Cube Association,
*23:21.540- 23:25.800* :  there's still chance for him or Tsar Shishien to claim the title yet.
*23:26.720- 23:27.620* :  Carrie Helen reporting.
*23:28.260- 23:31.040* :  When she's on tour, I'm sure Beyoncé flies in a private jet.
*23:31.460- 23:33.360* :  When they're on tour, Seth and Chris,
*23:33.360- 23:36.580* :  who perform as Philkin's drift, walk between gigs.
*23:37.240- 23:39.540* :  This is taking sustainable touring to a whole new level,
*23:39.780- 23:43.920* :  walking 1,400 kilometers with their instrument strapped to their backs
*23:43.960- 23:46.460* :  to play schools of venues around Wales.
*23:47.100- 23:48.020* :  I've been talking to Seth.
*23:48.840- 23:51.340* :  We wanted to undergo a long-distance walk
*23:51.440- 23:53.660* :  because it would be really environmentally friendly.
*23:53.720- 23:57.240* :  And we thought, hang on a minute, we could combine our love of roaming
*23:57.860- 23:58.880* :  and of making music.
*23:59.060- 24:02.520* :  So we took inspiration from the ancient Welsh Bardic tradition
*24:03.100- 24:06.860* :  trying to revive it and think of more sustainable ways to make music.
*24:07.360- 24:11.000* :  I think we're probably the first people to do anything on this scale.
*24:11.880- 24:14.640* :  And go on a long walk of 870 miles.
*24:14.640- 24:17.160* :  Did you have all the gigs booked in advance?
*24:17.160- 24:19.460* :  Or were some of them more impromptu than that?
*24:20.520- 24:24.160* :  We had 45 gigs booked over the 59 days.
*24:24.920- 24:27.680* :  And by the time it got to the tour itself
*24:27.740- 24:29.620* :  and we were meeting people along the way
*24:29.620- 24:32.420* :  and making new connections with venues
*24:32.420- 24:35.120* :  and also storytellers and singers and songwriters,
*24:35.780- 24:39.100* :  we began to fill in the spare evenings with more and more gigs.
*24:39.140- 24:42.380* :  So we didn't really end up with very few evenings off.
*24:42.900- 24:46.200* :  OK. And obviously you're carrying a fiddle and a guitar.
*24:46.200- 24:48.200* :  What else did you need to look around with you, though?
*24:48.800- 24:51.440* :  To be honest, we tried to carry as little as we could
*24:51.580- 24:54.820* :  because we had no support vehicle, no van, anything like that.
*24:55.220- 24:56.240* :  We were carrying everything.
*24:56.240- 24:59.200* :  So for me, fiddle and my bandmate was carrying his guitar
*24:59.840- 25:01.020* :  and then we had microphones.
*25:01.240- 25:03.600* :  We had CDs to sell with us on the road.
*25:04.300- 25:06.900* :  And in terms of clothes, that was about it.
*25:06.900- 25:08.960* :  We just had one set of clothes to walk in
*25:09.580- 25:10.920* :  and one set of clothes to perform in.
*25:10.920- 25:12.760* :  And you've got to do it, haven't you?
*25:12.760- 25:15.440* :  When you plan the logistics like this and the gigs are booked,
*25:15.920- 25:17.920* :  you can't get to a hill and think,
*25:18.580- 25:19.940* :  I don't fancy climbing up that right now.
*25:19.940- 25:21.660* :  You've got to go for it.
*25:21.860- 25:25.560* :  Exactly. There's very little alternative solution, really.
*25:25.960- 25:29.940* :  And sometimes we'd underestimate quite how long it would take us to get there
*25:29.960- 25:33.420* :  because we were walking 15 or 20 miles every day.
*25:33.840- 25:35.740* :  And of course, we had a gig to get to.
*25:35.740- 25:38.120* :  It's not like we could shift the route, the miles around.
*25:38.620- 25:41.420* :  We actually had to make sure that we walked to the venue
*25:42.060- 25:43.920* :  and more importantly, arrived there on time.
*25:43.920- 25:46.920* :  So there was a few days where we ended up fell running,
*25:46.980- 25:50.180* :  scrambling up the hills to try and make it to the gigs on time.
*25:50.920- 25:53.560* :  Was the one memory that stuck out above all others
*25:53.560- 25:55.020* :  from this epic journey?
*25:55.820- 25:58.420* :  One of our favourite gigs was at a place called
*25:58.420- 26:02.700* :  Henbant Permaculture Farm where they've never put on a gig before
*26:02.700- 26:07.100* :  but it's this beautiful collection of people making organic food
*26:07.860- 26:09.080* :  and living communally.
*26:09.240- 26:13.440* :  And we had such a wonderful gig there in one of their old timber barns
*26:13.440- 26:14.260* :  which was gorgeous.
*26:14.820- 26:16.480* :  Another one would be on the clean peninsula
*26:17.400- 26:20.320* :  where we spent about a week going around the coast there
*26:20.360- 26:22.580* :  and met some really interesting sculptures
*26:23.600- 26:26.840* :  and meeting these people who were living their lives off the road,
*26:26.840- 26:27.800* :  off the main road.
*26:28.000- 26:30.920* :  It was a wonderful man who baked sourdough baker
*26:30.920- 26:34.740* :  and would deliver it to the local villages on Ponyback.
*26:45.260- 26:47.840* :  Well, we're lucky that you've got your fiddle with you
*26:48.220- 26:49.940* :  and you've told us that you don't need more than that
*26:49.940- 26:51.460* :  in order to be able to perform.
*26:51.460- 26:54.360* :  So, although it doesn't involve walking up a hill,
*26:54.760- 26:56.020* :  can you do a little gig for us now?
*26:56.340- 26:59.720* :  For sure, yeah, I'll play a tune called Annabelle's Jig
*26:59.720- 27:01.700* :  which is one from our latest EP.
*27:14.420- 27:15.620* :  And that's all from us for now.

*28:04.300- 28:05.740* :  It's about the risk takers.
*28:05.740- 28:09.320* :  I decided to climb the Himalayas all four Olympics.
*28:09.720- 28:11.300* :  And the game changers.
*28:11.640- 28:13.180* :  I want to play like my brother.
