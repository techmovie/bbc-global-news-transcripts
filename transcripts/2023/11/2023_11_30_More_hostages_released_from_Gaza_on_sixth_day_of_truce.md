*01:49.880- 01:54.480* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Thursday the 30th of November, these are our main
*01:54.480- 02:00.680* :  stories. Sixteen hostages who had been held by Hamas in Gaza have been freed on the sixth day
*02:00.680- 02:07.240* :  of a pause in hostilities. US prosecutors say an Indian government employee directed a failed plot
*02:07.640- 02:14.200* :  to assassinate a Sikh activist in New York. Also in this podcast.
*02:20.840- 02:27.160* :  That is the music of spheres in this case a perfect solar system 100 light years away.
*02:31.600- 02:37.680* :  But we start with the war in Israel and Gaza. Sixteen more hostages have been released by Hamas
*02:38.100- 02:43.980* :  as part of a ceasefire arrangement in return for Palestinian prisoners. The hostages were
*02:43.980- 02:48.860* :  handed over by Hamas late on Wednesday evening to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
*02:49.540- 02:54.640* :  Negotiations on extending a truce beyond Wednesday have been continuing. Meanwhile,
*02:54.640- 02:59.320* :  Israel's military says it's checking a claim by Hamas that the youngest hostage,
*02:59.320- 03:05.600* :  a 10-month-old baby, Kaffir Bibas, his four-year-old brother and the pair's mother were killed
*03:05.600- 03:11.020* :  in an Israeli aerial bombing. You may remember pictures of the children with their distinctive red hair.
*03:11.020- 03:17.360* :  Israel's Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz said he had had an emotional meeting with the Bibas family members.
*03:21.080- 03:25.740* :  First of all, I did meet with members of the Bibas family. It was a painful meeting
*03:25.740- 03:30.880* :  and became even more painful after the developments reported by the media emerged.
*03:31.940- 03:37.920* :  Those reports are not confirmed, but they're painful. And I don't know if they're true or not
*03:37.940- 03:44.000* :  true, but it's certainly part of the brutal psychological warfare that our enemies are undertaking.
*03:45.080- 03:49.100* :  Well, just before recording this podcast, I spoke to our correspondent Paul Adams. He's
*03:49.100- 03:54.640* :  based in Jerusalem. We covered much of the developments today in Israel and Gaza, but I started by
*03:54.640- 04:00.860* :  asking him for more information on the latest hostage release. 16 hostages were handed over to the
*04:00.860- 04:08.100* :  Red Cross tonight. That included 12 Israelis, several of them dual nationals, and four ties.
*04:08.640- 04:16.040* :  And yes, that does bring to an end the kind of agreed six consecutive exchanges because we will
*04:16.040- 04:22.180* :  see sometime later on this evening another group of 30 Palestinian prisoners also released.
*04:22.180- 04:27.780* :  What we don't know is where it goes from here because at the moment, even though we have heard
*04:27.780- 04:33.500* :  in recent days, expressions of a willingness on both sides to have more of this because it seems
*04:33.500- 04:38.800* :  to be working, at the moment, we don't actually have any agreement. And there is some suggestion
*04:38.800- 04:44.580* :  that Hamas is not happy with some of the terms being offered. So there is an element of doubt about
*04:44.580- 04:50.740* :  whether we will see another round of exchanges tomorrow or whether we will be back to Israel's
*04:51.020- 04:55.080* :  military operation. But I was going to say, I mean, that could be the outcome. Could it within
*04:55.080- 05:00.400* :  hours that there is no extension and military operations resume? That is certainly a possibility,
*05:00.460- 05:05.380* :  and it is one that rhetorically at least Israeli officials from the Prime Minister on down
*05:05.380- 05:12.100* :  seem to be preparing the ground for or warning about. But as I say, because this exchange of
*05:12.100- 05:19.140* :  hostages and prisoners has gone ahead essentially without a hitch for six days now and that both sides
*05:19.140- 05:25.440* :  seem to believe that it's a process that is yielding the things that they want. The hostages,
*05:25.440- 05:32.720* :  obviously, with more women and children still remaining in captivity, and of course a significant
*05:32.720- 05:38.040* :  number now of Palestinian prisoners, it is perfectly possible that they will both decide
*05:38.040- 05:42.220* :  to keep this going for a few more days. We just haven't had that word yet.
*05:42.500- 05:45.320* :  Okay, just quickly, Hamas tonight apparently making proposals to
*05:45.820- 05:50.800* :  suggesting the release of all the Israeli soldiers they hold in exchange for all Palestinians
*05:50.800- 05:56.260* :  in prisons in Israel. I mean, is that bluntly a goer? Not at the moment at all. In fact, one
*05:56.260- 06:01.440* :  senior Israeli official earlier today was saying that they hadn't even heard of such a deal.
*06:01.660- 06:05.620* :  I mean, that would be, I mean, that is the deal to end all deals. That would be astonishing,
*06:05.620- 06:11.040* :  frankly, if a deal was reached that would result in the release of all of the remaining hostages
*06:11.040- 06:17.600* :  who include a great number of Israeli soldiers, both male and female, and presumably a very,
*06:17.600- 06:23.480* :  very large number of Palestinian prisoners. That's something that I think is being pushed for,
*06:23.480- 06:27.920* :  looked for by international diplomats, but I don't think at the moment is on the cards.
*06:28.140- 06:32.180* :  Just finally, Paul, and far more troubling tonight, the Israeli military is looking into these
*06:32.180- 06:37.960* :  claims from Hamas that the Bebas family, the mother, the two sons, who become these symbols
*06:37.960- 06:43.140* :  of the war for many in Israel are dead. Hamas claiming they're died in Israeli aerial attack.
*06:43.140- 06:47.180* :  What do we know of that? We don't have any confirmation of that. Yes, Hamas
*06:47.180- 06:52.280* :  made that claim. Yes, the Israelis are looking into it. Members of the Bebas family have said
*06:52.280- 06:58.640* :  they hope the information proves false and they've asked for privacy, but certainly any sense of
*06:58.960- 07:05.320* :  of relief or joy among Israelis tonight at the release of another group of hostages is hugely
*07:05.320- 07:11.620* :  tempered by a profound sense of apprehension about the fate of Shiri Bebas and her two boys Ariel
*07:12.080- 07:16.840* :  and Kaffir who, as you say, have really become symbols of this whole dreadful story.
*07:17.440- 07:21.700* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Well, more than eight weeks into the Israel
*07:21.700- 07:28.020* :  Gaza war aid agencies now fear that a lack of basic hygiene in Gaza will see diseases spread
*07:28.020- 07:33.980* :  rapidly there. We're a Davis has more. Even if the current pause in hostilities is extended by
*07:33.980- 07:39.840* :  a few days, Israel has made it clear the military offensive will soon resume targeting what remains
*07:39.840- 07:46.300* :  of Hamas' capabilities in southern Gaza. That, say, aid agencies will exacerbate what is already
*07:46.300- 07:51.920* :  a dire humanitarian situation, particularly around the southern city of Han Unis, where people
*07:51.920- 07:57.300* :  sought refuge from the fighting in the north. The fragile troops of the past six days
*07:57.700- 08:02.800* :  has allowed the UN and others to assess what damage seven weeks of bombing has done and what
*08:02.800- 08:09.220* :  pressing needs the population now has. Thomas White is the director of affairs in Gaza for the
*08:09.220- 08:16.260* :  United Nations Palestinian refugee agency. We cannot get enough aid in through the RAFA crossing
*08:17.260- 08:23.140* :  and right now is winter approaches with poor sanitation. We're very concerned about an outbreak
*08:23.140- 08:29.140* :  of infectious diseases such as watery diarrhea. There's people are forced to live in very cramped
*08:29.140- 08:37.380* :  conditions with poor sanitation. Nariman is living in a tent in southern Gaza. Her baby daughter
*08:37.380- 08:45.020* :  is 23 days old, younger than the war itself, and her whole family is sick. She says she doesn't have
*08:45.020- 08:50.040* :  enough money to buy her daughter medicine. She needed medical support to help her breathe. Her
*08:50.040- 08:55.840* :  husband has heart disease and high blood pressure. Israel has denied there's a humanitarian crisis
*08:56.420- 09:02.380* :  and points to the 200 or so trucks being allowed daily into Gaza, bringing in much-needed food,
*09:02.380- 09:06.920* :  medicines and limited fuel supplies. It's thought that more than one million
*09:06.920- 09:12.420* :  garsens are now living in temporary shelters, having been forced from their homes elsewhere
*09:12.420- 09:18.320* :  in the besieged Palestinian territory. If and when the bombing resumes, thousands of internally
*09:18.320- 09:24.920* :  displaced people in Gaza will face the prospect of having to move on again to areas with much less
*09:24.920- 09:31.620* :  aid and even fewer resources. We're a Davis reporting from Jerusalem. We're going to go to the U.S.
*09:31.620- 09:37.400* :  now and a story that also involves India and Canada. With allegations of a state-sponsored
*09:37.400- 09:43.000* :  assassination abroad and conspiracy to kill others, alarm has grown about what India's government
*09:43.000- 09:49.180* :  and its intelligence agencies may be doing in foreign countries. In New York City on Wednesday,
*09:49.180- 09:55.340* :  prosecutors charged an Indian national with being part of a foiled plot to murder a seek activist
*09:55.340- 10:01.240* :  on U.S. soil. The Biden administration has already warned India over evidence of its involvement
*10:01.240- 10:07.840* :  in plots to kill Indians abroad. All of this is just a few months after relations between India and
*10:07.840- 10:13.180* :  Canada plummeted. After the Canadian government said there were credible allegations that Indian
*10:13.180- 10:17.660* :  agents were involved in the murder of another seek activist, this time in Vancouver.
*10:18.340- 10:21.140* :  For more, I spoke to our North America correspondent Netotovik.
*10:21.380- 10:27.580* :  Prosecutor is alleged that this Indian man, the kill Gupta, was recruited in May by an Indian
*10:27.580- 10:33.120* :  government employee in this murder for a higher plot to kill the seek activist in New York and
*10:33.120- 10:38.020* :  they say that Nikhil Gupta had been involved in international narcotics and weapons trafficking
*10:38.060- 10:46.200* :  and he was attempting to hire a hitman for $100,000 to kill this activist allegedly and they
*10:46.200- 10:51.640* :  say that this individual he was trying to hire was in fact a confidential source working with
*10:51.640- 10:57.140* :  U.S. authorities, working with the U.S. Drug and Enforcement Agency. And they say that the
*10:57.140- 11:03.940* :  Indian government employee gave Nikhil Gupta information about the target, his day-to-day activities,
*11:03.940- 11:10.960* :  his address, his phone number. And when that seek Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nezeron, was killed
*11:10.960- 11:17.880* :  in British Columbia, they say Nikhil Gupta sent a video of that to this hitman he thought he
*11:17.880- 11:24.660* :  was hiring and said it was now time to go ahead. There was no need to wait. It was time to carry out
*11:24.660- 11:31.720* :  that assassination, that target. And the United States says that they foiled that plot and went on
*11:31.720- 11:36.520* :  to discuss how this is an ongoing investigation, how that this has been raised with the highest
*11:36.580- 11:41.840* :  levels in the Indian government. So just to be clear on this, there are allegations made in that
*11:41.840- 11:48.980* :  New York court today about an attempt to kill someone on U.S. soil, a seek activist, but what
*11:48.980- 11:53.560* :  happened in Canada did happen, didn't that was a murder of a man there that did go ahead, a
*11:53.560- 11:58.420* :  distinctly different and more serious case. That's right, but this indictment alleges that the
*11:58.420- 12:05.220* :  two were associates and that the man Nikhil Gupta told this hitman he thought he was hiring,
*12:05.220- 12:10.840* :  who was instead a U.S. official, that Hardeep Singh Nezeron was one of their targets as well,
*12:10.840- 12:16.140* :  along with others. So what we had heard from the Canadian Foreign Minister today, Melanie Joy,
*12:16.140- 12:21.520* :  she didn't comment on the U.S. case, but she said that they stand by their credible allegations
*12:21.540- 12:26.760* :  that the Indian government was involved there, and the United States says that they have dispatched
*12:26.760- 12:31.560* :  their director of national intelligence to India to share the additional information they have,
*12:31.560- 12:36.640* :  so India can carry out their own investigation. Netta Taufik in New York, well, let's stay in the U.S.
*12:36.640- 12:41.840* :  because a congressman who lied about his life and career, on the way to being elected just last
*12:41.840- 12:47.720* :  year, will find out today, first day, if he's being expelled. George Santos became one of the first
*12:47.720- 12:53.840* :  openly gay Republicans in Congress last November, but since then, a litany of accusations and
*12:53.840- 12:58.840* :  deceptions has followed. Now, the Republican Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who's on the
*12:58.840- 13:04.100* :  same political side as Mr. Santos, has said the vote on whether to expel him is coming.
*13:04.480- 13:08.180* :  So what we've said is leadership team is we're going to allow people to vote their conscience.
*13:08.180- 13:13.160* :  I think it's the only appropriate thing we can do. We've not whipped the vote and we wouldn't.
*13:13.620- 13:19.440* :  I trust that people will make that decision thoughtfully and in good faith. I personally have
*13:19.440- 13:24.600* :  real reservations about doing this. I'm concerned about a president and maybe set for that.
*13:25.480- 13:27.640* :  So where everybody's working through that, and we'll see how they vote.
*13:28.060- 13:33.260* :  So with the prospect of expulsion coming, I spoke to our correspondence Anthony Zirke in Washington,
*13:33.260- 13:39.720* :  who told me more about George Santos. The dub is that he abused his position as a candidate,
*13:39.720- 13:45.400* :  essentially using campaign money for his own personal benefits. He raised campaign figures.
*13:45.400- 13:49.660* :  He fraudulently misrepresented the kind of money he had and then the money he did have.
*13:49.660- 13:57.460* :  He spent on personal expenditures such as clothing and internet services, adult internet services.
*13:57.980- 14:04.280* :  That was detailed in a report by the Congressional Ethics Committee and that multi-page,
*14:04.280- 14:09.960* :  100-page report, once the members of Congress have viewed it, I think it became very clear
*14:10.600- 14:15.860* :  that George Santos lost support within even among Republicans in the House representative,
*14:15.860- 14:20.400* :  which is why this, the third attempt to oust him since George Santos was elected,
*14:20.800- 14:22.880* :  seems like it is the most likely to be successful.
*14:22.880- 14:28.560* :  And it would be highly unusual. Am I right? I mean, barely a handful of members of Congress have
*14:28.560- 14:33.480* :  been expelled in the past? Only two in the modern era. They're more dating back to the
*14:33.480- 14:40.940* :  post-civil war during the Civil War era of the 1860s. But it is extremely rare and never before
*14:40.940- 14:47.100* :  has someone not connected to the Confederacy or not been convicted of a crime in a court-benic
*14:47.100- 14:53.160* :  spell. So this would be unusual in that regard. But George Santos is a relatively new arrival
*14:53.160- 14:58.640* :  to Capitol Hill. He has few allies within the Republican Party in the House of Representatives.
*14:58.640- 15:02.480* :  So that may have made it easier, although it hasn't met all that easy, but easier
*15:03.000- 15:06.420* :  to to expel him because he doesn't have those kind of deep roots in Washington.
*15:07.320- 15:13.880* :  Anthony Zürker. Now the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28,
*15:13.880- 15:20.600* :  begins in Dubai today. The president of COP28, Sultan Al-Jaba, has denied that his country planned
*15:20.600- 15:27.200* :  to use the meeting to strike oil and gas deals. Leaked documents obtained by the BBC and the
*15:27.200- 15:32.780* :  Centre for Climate Reporting earlier this week revealed proposals to discuss fossil fuel projects
*15:32.780- 15:39.600* :  with 15 nations at the talks going on in Dubai. In their response to that claim, the UAE team did
*15:39.600- 15:45.560* :  not deny using COP28 meetings to discuss business. They said that private meetings were private.
*15:46.300- 15:51.400* :  So as COP28 gets underway, many countries around the world are facing problems relating to
*15:51.400- 15:55.560* :  changes in climate, which is hotter temperatures or the prospect of flooding.
*15:56.320- 16:01.460* :  With sea levels rising around the globe, Miami, in the US state of Florida, is facing an urgent
*16:01.460- 16:07.520* :  need to adapt. As property investors turn their gaze inland, away from the exclusive low-lying
*16:07.520- 16:12.880* :  beach area, residents in one poorer neighborhood, further above sea level, say rising rents,
*16:12.880- 16:18.500* :  are forcing them out. Natalia Zourl has been speaking to locals campaigning against what they call
*16:18.500- 16:28.860* :  climate gentrification. On a warm summer day, a crowd gathers outside the Eglise-Dune Nazarene
*16:28.860- 16:36.660* :  Church in Miami. People jog in line as volunteers hand out food parcels. Prices in this
*16:36.660- 16:40.460* :  neighbourhood have been increasing. It's called Little Haiti.
*16:45.400- 16:51.560* :  Much of Little Haiti is made up of low-income housing. Miami has become hotter and more humid
*16:51.560- 16:57.700* :  in recent years, making some poorly maintained properties uninhabitable. At the same time,
*16:57.700- 17:03.000* :  rents have spiked, pushing many residents of Little Haiti into housing insecurity.
*17:03.640- 17:08.900* :  Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. It's money.
*17:09.420- 17:14.560* :  Renita Holmes is one of them. Miami-born and raised, I'm an African-American inner-city
*17:14.560- 17:20.960* :  woman that loves my city and loves my community. She moved into a new flat earlier this year.
*17:21.720- 17:27.020* :  Many of her belongings are still in boxes. I haven't unpacked this time. This is my fourth move
*17:27.840- 17:35.720* :  in three years. So curtains are a luxury and that's what Aluminum foil does and making sure that
*17:35.720- 17:42.220* :  covering my windows keeps the humidity down. Renita Stogzayan is suffering because of the humidity.
*17:42.280- 17:49.020* :  She daps his paws with a wet cloth, but humidity isn't the only issue.
*17:49.860- 17:55.540* :  In Miami, sea levels have risen by 15 centimeters in the past 31 years.
*17:56.280- 18:02.620* :  The city has become more prone to flooding. Little Haiti is located on a limestone ridge
*18:03.080- 18:08.580* :  about five and a half meters above sea level and is perceived as more resilient to flooding,
*18:08.580- 18:14.560* :  with new wealthy buyers seeking a safe investment and pricing out the existing community.
*18:15.300- 18:22.520* :  There were people who have seen flyers, who have seen ads, and who have talked to real estate
*18:22.520- 18:28.720* :  salespeople and heard, but hey, you'll know you'll be in higher ground. You'll be safer from the
*18:28.720- 18:32.120* :  floods. You'll be safer from the storms. You'll be safer from sea level rise.
*18:32.560- 18:37.560* :  Professor William Butler of Florida State University has researched climate gentrification
*18:37.560- 18:43.740* :  in Little Haiti. He says it's too soon to say whether it is the key driver of rent inflation,
*18:44.700- 18:51.400* :  but he thinks it's clearly a factor. That adds one more layer to drivers of displacement of
*18:51.400- 18:57.320* :  lower income people who are the most stressed in the context of climate change in the first place.
*19:01.180- 19:05.440* :  Renita Holmes wants to help her community push back against these pressures,
*19:05.840- 19:10.260* :  visiting neighbors to raise awareness on the day-to-day impact of climate change.
*19:11.360- 19:16.120* :  I go down the street and I talk to my sisters. I teach them what I know. As long as I got
*19:16.120- 19:24.620* :  empowerment, resilience and a voice, yeah, I live here. Reporting from Miami, that was Natalia Tsuo.

*21:41.760- 21:47.520* :  Now politics is moving fast in Pakistan. On Wednesday morning it was revealed that the
*21:47.520- 21:52.780* :  country's former prime minister Imran Khan was to step down as chairman of his own PTI party.
*21:53.300- 21:57.640* :  He's currently in jail and is barred from standing in the election that's due in February.
*21:58.260- 22:03.300* :  A few hours later a court in Islamabad quashed a corruption allegation against his main rival,
*22:03.300- 22:09.800* :  Noah Sharif. It was only a few weeks ago that Mr Sharif arrived back in Pakistan after years in
*22:09.800- 22:15.460* :  exile abroad where he was avoiding jail on that corruption conviction. The three times prime
*22:15.460- 22:20.680* :  minister has one last legal hurdle to cross before he can stand in the election in just a few months
*22:20.680- 22:25.800* :  time. So what are his chances of making it a fourth time as the country's prime minister?
*22:26.380- 22:34.000* :  Well I asked BBC Urdu's Asif Faruki. So Noah Sharif was acquitted in one of the two cases that he
*22:34.000- 22:41.140* :  was convicted of a couple of years ago. This is significant in terms of his political narrative
*22:41.140- 22:48.460* :  building. He's going into elections which are scheduled for 8th February. He can go to public now
*22:48.460- 22:53.900* :  and say that look you know here I am cleared by the courts and I am not a corrupt man anymore.
*22:53.900- 23:00.680* :  But there is another case which is pending, deceit is pending in that case also and the way
*23:00.680- 23:06.640* :  the court is hitting that case it is very likely that a verdict on that case would also be
*23:06.640- 23:11.160* :  you know announced before the elections. But it looks like we're saying the kind of rehabilitation
*23:11.160- 23:15.860* :  of Noah Sharif doesn't it? Yeah it's a very interesting word rehabilitation that's what
*23:15.860- 23:21.600* :  everyone is saying in the country. Pakistan people's party, one of the opponents party they call him
*23:21.600- 23:26.640* :  the blue eyed of the military establishment and that's what the baggage is for him now.
*23:27.040- 23:31.360* :  In the last election the baggage was the corruption that you know he was the most corrupt man in
*23:31.360- 23:38.980* :  the country but now while the courts are you know acquitting him he is faced with this another
*23:38.980- 23:43.960* :  narrative that is going against him that he is being supported by the military establishment.
*23:44.360- 23:48.240* :  All right well let's talk about that and I know that we could talk about this for days and days but
*23:48.580- 23:53.020* :  the significance of Pakistan's military within its national politics and and their relationship
*23:53.020- 23:58.700* :  Nawar Sharif where are we on those things? It's not really a relationship with Nawar Sharif to
*23:58.700- 24:05.680* :  be honest it's military in terms of who suits them to lead the country who can work with them
*24:06.160- 24:13.220* :  in a way that suits them. In you know we saw in 2018 elections it was Imran Khan who the
*24:13.220- 24:20.120* :  military supported and now it is Nawar Sharif. So basically it's a no-win situation for politicians
*24:20.120- 24:24.220* :  but it's a win-win situation for the military establishment who's calling the shots.
*24:24.240- 24:28.940* :  Just finally let's assume for the sake of this discussion that Nawar Sharif is clear on the
*24:28.940- 24:34.940* :  remaining charge you know and he rehabilitation is fulfilled. What are his political prospects now
*24:34.940- 24:40.740* :  as we look to the elections next early next year? He is the frontrunner to be honest the problem
*24:40.740- 24:47.900* :  is that if you go by the last elections PTI Imran Khan's party is still the most popular party in
*24:47.900- 24:55.200* :  the country but that party is not being allowed to contest the elections properly. Their rallies
*24:55.200- 25:02.160* :  are being disturbed their second year leadership is in jail. Imran Khan is really finding it hard to
*25:02.160- 25:07.360* :  find the candidates to contest in like 300 seats in the country. Asif Faroukhi.
*25:08.140- 25:13.560* :  Now America's Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has insisted there's no sense of fatigue in
*25:13.560- 25:18.860* :  the NATO alliance when it comes to helping Ukraine. He added that there was continued support
*25:18.860- 25:25.360* :  in Congress in the US despite its resistance to an aid package for Ukraine. Keepers concerned
*25:25.360- 25:31.120* :  the conflict in Gaza has drawn away the West's attention as Sophia Batitzer reports from a
*25:31.120- 25:37.300* :  NATO meeting in Brussels. There is no Ukraine fatigue. This was the message of unwavering support
*25:37.300- 25:43.360* :  that NATO foreign ministers were keen to project. There had been concerns that support from the
*25:43.360- 25:49.640* :  United States NATO's most powerful member could falter as the countries preoccupied with the
*25:49.640- 25:55.460* :  conflict in the Middle East but Anthony Blinken reassured NATO allies that America could handle
*25:55.460- 26:01.440* :  two wars at the same time and that Russia could not be allowed to redraw borders by force.
*26:01.740- 26:08.280* :  But there are 31 countries in NATO and some of them are not keen on sending more aid to Kiev.
*26:08.280- 26:14.740* :  There is some frustration that despite substantial military support which includes missiles from
*26:14.740- 26:21.620* :  the UK and France, drones, ammunition and air defence over the past year, Ukraine has not been
*26:21.620- 26:27.520* :  able to achieve the territorial gains they were hoping for and that the great counteroffensive
*26:27.520- 26:33.200* :  they promised has not materialized. We're going to stay in Europe because Finland is closing
*26:33.200- 26:40.160* :  its entire 1,300 km long land border with Russia today after accusing Moscow of deliberately
*26:40.160- 26:46.820* :  helping migrants cross into its territory. About 900 asylum seekers entered Finland from Russia this
*26:46.820- 26:52.500* :  month. That's up from the normal monthly rate of under just 30. The authorities say the
*26:52.500- 26:57.720* :  migrants come from countries such as Morocco, Pakistan and Syria and their accused Russian authorities
*26:57.720- 27:03.640* :  of engaging in what they call a hybrid attack. My colleague Tim Franks spoke to Marie Rantonen
*27:03.640- 27:10.820* :  Finland's Interior Minister. We made this decision because these activities have continued to
*27:10.820- 27:18.480* :  despite the measures Finland has taken before. The risk that these activities will escalate
*27:18.480- 27:26.840* :  poses a serious threat to national security and public order and our message is that Finland
*27:26.840- 27:35.760* :  don't accept this from Russian authorities. You say a serious threat to national security that's
*27:35.760- 27:43.120* :  quite alarming language to use. I mean we're talking about a few well several hundred asylum
*27:43.120- 27:48.880* :  seekers crossing into Finland. I mean that is that really a threat to national security?
*27:49.360- 27:59.040* :  This is not a case about the numbers. This is a case of hybrid operation where we know
*27:59.040- 28:09.580* :  that Russian authorities are involved. So this makes it much more dangerous for national security
*28:10.020- 28:18.240* :  and the second thing is that the potential risk is very high and we also know that these
*28:18.240- 28:26.080* :  people who is coming now the profile is that they are young males from African and the Middle East
*28:26.080- 28:35.440* :  countries. They have bought visa to Russian and they continue their trip to Finnish border
*28:35.500- 28:44.360* :  helped by Russian authorities and this makes it much more bigger risk and that's why we have to
*28:44.940- 28:50.720* :  and we want to say to Russian authorities that this needs to stop.
*28:50.720- 28:57.860* :  You will be aware of course that Russia denies that it's involved in this at all. You say that
*28:57.900- 29:03.140* :  you know for certain that Russia is involved. I mean are you able to make that evidence
*29:03.140- 29:10.540* :  public? Are you able to explain just how with what certainty you know that Moscow is involved?
*29:10.980- 29:17.540* :  I was talking about the Russian authorities which actually our reporters have even seen
*29:17.540- 29:25.460* :  when they are on the border crossings. They can see that the Russian border guards are
*29:25.460- 29:32.180* :  bringing people to our border so we know exactly otherwise they wouldn't to bring them.
*29:32.520- 29:37.480* :  You've actually seen the Russian authorities involved in this in this operation.
*29:37.740- 29:44.920* :  What do you say to for example the UN refugee agencies representative in the Nordic and
*29:44.920- 29:51.260* :  Baltic countries? Anika Sandland has said that closing all border crossing points would be
*29:51.260- 29:58.780* :  country in her words to international law presumably on the grounds that you need to give people
*29:58.780- 30:06.880* :  the opportunity to claim asylum. Yes well these people have been coming a thousand of
*30:06.880- 30:15.520* :  kilometers to Russia. They have bought a visa to Russia. So first of all they can use another route
*30:15.520- 30:23.540* :  and the second thing is that if you are seeking asylum I think you have on your own country
*30:24.080- 30:33.300* :  some kind of threat to violence or stuff like that. So well they went to Russia. Why don't they
*30:34.240- 30:39.140* :  apply asylum from there? They have legal right to stay in Russian. Yeah.
*30:39.620- 30:44.540* :  That was Mari Ranton and Finland's interior minister. Now I find some of the details in this next
*30:44.540- 30:49.080* :  story just mind blowing if I'm honest because astronomers have discovered what they've described
*30:49.080- 30:55.560* :  as the perfect solar system. It consists of six planets all about the same size which have barely
*30:55.560- 31:01.840* :  changed since the system was formed 12 billion years ago. Researchers say the undisturbed conditions
*31:01.920- 31:06.820* :  make it ideal for scientists to learn how the planets formed and if they are home to life.
*31:07.460- 31:12.760* :  With more here's our science correspondent Palakush. Our own solar system had violent beginnings.
*31:12.760- 31:18.440* :  Worlds crashed into each other as they formed, disturbing their orbits and eventually
*31:18.440- 31:24.900* :  leading to the planets of vastly different sizes we know today. But a hundred light years away
*31:24.900- 31:30.760* :  astronomers have found another solar system, one that was created in much calmer conditions
*31:31.300- 31:37.120* :  without so many violent collisions. As a result its six planets are of similar size
*31:37.120- 31:42.780* :  between two and three times bigger than the Earth and their orbits are in perfect sync with each
*31:42.780- 31:51.180* :  other. So much so that the researchers commissioned this piece of music where each note corresponds
*31:51.260- 32:01.340* :  to a completed orbit of each planet. Dr. Rafael Luque of the University of Chicago led the project.
*32:01.700- 32:07.820* :  It's a perfect solar system. It's in a perfect harmony. It's in a very beautiful orbital
*32:07.820- 32:13.760* :  configuration which is a extremely rare and unlike our solar system its formation was very gentle
*32:13.760- 32:20.200* :  almost on this turf for billions of years and that's why this unique properties are going to allow
*32:20.200- 32:25.440* :  us to learn how these planets form evolve and whether they can host life. Astronomers have
*32:25.440- 32:31.860* :  discovered thousands of solar systems in the past 30 years but none of them is so well suited to
*32:31.860- 32:38.080* :  study how planets formed as this one. The next step is to analyze the atmospheres of the newly
*32:38.080- 32:43.980* :  discovered worlds to see if there are gases present that on Earth could only be produced by living
*32:44.540- 32:51.140* :  organisms. That was Palab Gersh. Now we're going to end on the saga of the two wills. One found
*32:51.140- 32:57.040* :  stuck down the back of a sofa, a collection of million dollar houses and furs and the musical legacy
*32:57.040- 33:13.640* :  of this sole legend. That was Aretha Franklin singing Think. She died five years ago. Her
*33:13.640- 33:19.380* :  place among America's sole legends is very much secure but she left a bit of a legal mess for
*33:19.380- 33:25.360* :  her immediate family. Two handwritten wills were found in her home, one with a smiley face.
*33:25.360- 33:31.080* :  Earlier this year a court ruled which one of those was valid. It turned out the smiley face one
*33:31.080- 33:36.820* :  found in the sofa was valid and on Wednesday her son's finally took possession of her estate.
*33:37.520- 33:40.620* :  I asked our music correspondent Mark Savage to take us back to the beginning.
*33:40.940- 33:46.520* :  When Aretha Franklin died five years ago in 2018 her family thought that she'd left no will
*33:46.980- 33:52.060* :  at all and under Michigan law that would have meant that her assets would have been divided equally
*33:52.060- 33:58.500* :  amongst all four of her sons but then within a couple of months they find two separate documents
*33:58.500- 34:04.700* :  inside her house in Detroit. One was in a locked cabinet and the other was a spiral notebook that
*34:04.700- 34:10.480* :  was stuffed between two cushions on her couch and they were slightly different in how they divided
*34:10.480- 34:16.980* :  up her estate between her four sons. Neither of those documents was prepared by a lawyer, neither
*34:16.980- 34:25.420* :  listed witnesses but the first one was notarized. That came from 2010 and that said that her son should
*34:25.420- 34:33.740* :  basically get equal rights to all of her property, of her music copyright, of the furs that she
*34:33.740- 34:37.960* :  owned and the cash that she had in the bank. The second one, which was the one that was found
*34:37.960- 34:44.700* :  down the back of a sofa, wasn't properly signed. She'd in fact put a smiley face inside the capital A
*34:44.700- 34:51.500* :  of Aretha at the bottom of the letter and it suggested that her youngest son, KELF, should get
*34:51.500- 34:58.560* :  her most expensive property, a $1.2 million gated mansion in the suburbs of Detroit and there was
*34:58.560- 35:05.160* :  then a long court argument over which of those documents carried more weight because obviously
*35:05.260- 35:10.620* :  in some cases it preferred one son over the other. And Amonis has it been acrimonious?
*35:10.620- 35:16.520* :  Has it been nasty? It hasn't been nasty. They have taken it to court because they wanted basically
*35:16.520- 35:24.000* :  a jury to decide which of those two wills was the most valid. In court the two sons who had the
*35:24.000- 35:29.360* :  most to gain her lose said that they still talked outside of the court that things were stiff but
*35:29.360- 35:35.000* :  they got on as well as three old men could. And this is about you said for a coach you talked
*35:35.000- 35:41.440* :  about houses. I mean what's at stake here? Her estate was a portfolio of about $6 million worth
*35:41.440- 35:47.340* :  of property that's four houses. She had lots of cherished items like furs, jewelry, musical instruments
*35:47.340- 35:52.480* :  but also the copyright to the music that she recorded in her life. And of course that includes
*35:52.480- 35:58.360* :  iconic songs like Respect, like Think, I say a little prayer and all of the money that comes in
*35:58.360- 36:02.660* :  from the royalties of those. And presumably the most valuable part of the estate is the copyright.
*36:02.660- 36:06.640* :  It is the music that that intellectual property that's the most significant thing is it?
*36:06.760- 36:12.780* :  I mean certainly that is Aretha Franklin's legacy and if you are in charge of the copyright of
*36:12.780- 36:17.600* :  that music then you get to say whether or not it gets used in a film whether it gets used in a
*36:17.600- 36:23.260* :  presidential campaign say and obviously whether there might be things like a film biopic of her
*36:23.260- 36:28.800* :  life or a stage musical then the person who is in charge of that copyright would get to make
*36:28.800- 36:34.740* :  those calls. Now under both of the two wills essentially the music copyright was split evenly
*36:34.740- 36:39.680* :  between the four sons. So really that side of it isn't in too much of contention what they were
*36:39.680- 36:46.160* :  really worried about at this stage was who got which property? Well that was Mark Slavitch on Aretha's
*36:46.360- 36:53.000* :  Two Wills. That's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
