*00:53.720- 00:56.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:59.940- 01:04.720* :  I'm Janet Joliel, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 22nd of November, these are our main
*01:04.720- 01:10.240* :  stories. The Israeli government is considering a possible deal for the release of some of the hostages
*01:10.240- 01:16.940* :  held by Hamas and Gaza in return for a lengthy pause in the fighting. The chief executive of
*01:16.940- 01:22.540* :  Binance, the world's largest crypto currency exchange, has agreed to plead guilty to charges
*01:22.540- 01:31.740* :  of money laundering in the US. Also in this podcast, concerns rise in the UK about the number of
*01:31.740- 01:38.260* :  people dying after cosmetic surgery procedures in Turkey. As soon as I woke up, the surgeon said
*01:38.260- 01:43.540* :  you have to go, there was no talk about what to do afterwards with myself. I went back to the
*01:43.540- 01:50.560* :  hotel and I started seeing bloods. And the venomous two meter long green member on the loose in a
*01:56.520- 02:01.380* :  Dutch city. After more than six weeks of conflict in Gaza, it's looking increasingly likely that
*02:01.380- 02:07.880* :  dozens of people will be released on both sides, and there could be a lengthy pause in the fighting
*02:07.880- 02:13.920* :  which has claimed thousands of lives. Hopes are rising that dozens of hostages could be freed soon
*02:13.920- 02:20.280* :  by Hamas in return for the release of more than 100 Palestinian prisoners. Israel's Prime Minister
*02:20.280- 02:25.860* :  Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding a series of meetings with the war cabinet and government
*02:33.680- 02:37.300* :  ministers to discuss the proposed deal. Tonight we have a difficult decision, but it's the right
*02:37.820- 02:43.900* :  decision. The security establishment supports it. The war effort will not be hurt but will allow
*02:43.900- 02:50.500* :  the idea to prepare for the fighting to come. I say again, the war is continuing, the war will
*02:50.500- 02:56.960* :  continue until we release hostages until there will be a day after Hamas, and it no longer threatens
*03:00.000- 03:04.080* :  Israel. This came after the US President Joe Biden expressed cautious optimism.
*03:06.940- 03:13.580* :  I spoke recently about both the Prime Minister Netanyahu and the American.
*03:15.020- 03:23.180* :  My team is kind of the region's shuttering between Japan. We are now very close.
*03:29.320- 03:33.900* :  I don't want to get into the details of things because nothing has gotten to us done.
*03:35.020- 03:39.020* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Tom Bateman, told us more about the Israeli government's
*03:39.020- 03:46.060* :  discussions. What we are getting a sense of really now are the contours of a potential hostage
*03:46.060- 03:52.920* :  agreement in a senior Israeli official telling the BBC that this would involve the release of
*03:52.920- 04:01.700* :  around 12 hostages per day up to 50 in return for a four-day ceasefire. Now it's elsewhere
*04:01.700- 04:08.040* :  being reported that Israel would also release up to 150 Palestinian prisoners, and that would
*04:08.040- 04:12.460* :  explain why we're seeing this meeting of the wider Israeli government tonight because it would
*04:12.460- 04:18.640* :  have to sign that off. That measure could also be open to legal challenge, but it's said that
*04:18.640- 04:24.680* :  that could be done within 24 hours. So if this deal is signed off tonight, we may then get a
*04:24.680- 04:30.240* :  statement from Mr Netanyahu or from the government as a whole. If it is signed off, you're not going
*04:30.240- 04:34.220* :  to look at something happening on the ground immediately. It's going to take a bit more time
*04:34.380- 04:39.480* :  because of the potential for a legal challenge on the Israeli side, but then also of course the
*04:39.480- 04:45.660* :  logistics of just doing any kind of handover on the ground. And in return, what would happen in Gaza?
*04:46.100- 04:50.320* :  Well, I mean, what Hamas want is a ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
*04:50.760- 04:56.300* :  As far as we understand this deal, the sense is you would have a ceasefire and as that holds,
*04:56.360- 05:01.640* :  Hamas would then release more hostages per day. Now there appear to be some details around
*05:01.640- 05:07.960* :  things like for example, according to the same Israeli official, Hamas having requested for six
*05:07.960- 05:13.520* :  hours a day, there be no surveillance drones to allow them to release the hostages without
*05:13.520- 05:18.740* :  giving away sort of information about where Hamas are, that kind of thing. The Israelis are saying
*05:18.740- 05:24.560* :  well, they still have eyes over Gaza, even though they would take away surveillance drones and
*05:24.560- 05:29.600* :  balloons. So it looks like there's some quite sort of detailed elements of this agreement. And of
*05:29.600- 05:34.940* :  course, we're not party to all of the details. But there would still be a substantial number of
*05:34.940- 05:42.540* :  hostages being held by Hamas. And Israel still wouldn't have achieved its aim of destroying the
*05:43.020- 05:48.880* :  grip. Absolutely not. I was listening to a briefing earlier from a former Israeli negotiator,
*05:48.880- 05:53.480* :  who's done a lot of these things in the past. One of the points he made was that the Israelis
*05:53.480- 05:59.200* :  from a negotiation perspective will have to put themselves in the mind of Yehya Sinwah, who's the
*05:59.200- 06:05.000* :  leader of Hamas in Gaza and is basically making these decisions. Now he's not going to want to
*06:05.000- 06:10.900* :  release all of the hostages in the end because he will see keeping some of them effectively to use
*06:11.460- 06:17.700* :  to shield himself from Israeli military action. So that may be why the focus at the moment is
*06:17.700- 06:24.680* :  more on women and children, by both sides, being the focus of releases. It's clear that soldiers are
*06:24.680- 06:30.760* :  obviously held as well by Hamas. And you would then assume that Israel will want to resume its
*06:30.760- 06:36.500* :  military campaign. I mean, the army it is suggested would find it difficult to stop because it's
*06:36.500- 06:42.520* :  on the ground. It might find itself a kind of sitting duck to attack. So you would then expect
*06:42.520- 06:47.620* :  to see a military campaign resume. Mr Netanyahu has said that is what keeps the pressure on
*06:47.620- 06:52.500* :  Hamas and gives them leverage to try and get the release of more hostages. But all of that is a
*06:52.500- 06:58.220* :  tightrope that the Israelis are walking and it's why some of the families of hostages held have
*06:58.220- 07:04.040* :  called for a far greater prioritization of the release of hostages over the military campaign
*07:04.040- 07:07.920* :  and the immediate destruction of Hamas. Don Bateman in Jerusalem.
*07:08.920- 07:13.820* :  Well, Daniel Levy is president of the US Middle East project and a former Israeli peace
*07:13.820- 07:20.620* :  negotiator under Prime Minister's Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak. He opposes Israel's military
*07:20.620- 07:26.820* :  action in Gaza. He told my colleague, Evan Davis, what he thought had been happening over the past
*07:26.820- 07:32.280* :  couple of weeks. I was briefed on the parameters of the deal almost a month ago, informally,
*07:32.520- 07:37.940* :  before the Israeli ground incursion and the terms of that deal sound remarkably similar to
*07:37.940- 07:44.520* :  the briefing given by the Israeli security official to the media during these meetings of the war
*07:44.880- 07:48.860* :  cabinet. There's a lot of devil in the details. There's last minute issues to be closed.
*07:48.860- 07:54.840* :  The last two weeks, some of the details have been around Israeli air surveillance, for instance,
*07:54.840- 08:00.800* :  during the time of the release. But the basic point is this is what's been going on. Prime Minister
*08:00.800- 08:06.460* :  Netanyahu has been reluctant to go for this deal. The details have barely changed if at all and
*08:06.460- 08:10.940* :  perhaps not in Israel's favor. It has been that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows that once you go
*08:10.940- 08:18.280* :  down this route, the pressure inside Israel to secure further hostage releases is a new factor
*08:18.280- 08:23.920* :  and could lead to much greater pressure to end the military operation. And that is something
*08:23.920- 08:30.240* :  Netanyahu doesn't want to do because he neither feels that its objectives militarily had been
*08:30.240- 08:35.980* :  reached. I would argue unrealizable objectives. And the morning after, because that is when he will
*08:35.980- 08:41.720* :  face the music and the permissions of inquiry will begin and his hold on political power will become
*08:41.720- 08:47.360* :  very precarious indeed. But if what the Israelis need to do is to tell their public, we've
*08:47.580- 08:51.840* :  thought like tigers, we've got a better deal. If that's what they need in order to get this done,
*08:51.840- 08:58.460* :  then so be it. But this is not an expression of retreat by Israel. No measure of that at all.
*08:58.460- 09:04.520* :  Is it? I mean, I am assuming after about four dozen hostages have been released 12
*09:04.520- 09:10.500* :  a day for four days, we're back to full military offensive. Well, indeed, and in that statement
*09:10.500- 09:15.860* :  that the Israelis are putting out, it does say the military action will resume immediately.
*09:15.860- 09:22.860* :  However, the pressure inside Israel, the dynamic, the number that will be released during this
*09:22.860- 09:28.220* :  initial deal is not the entirety of those being held alive. It is perhaps a third or
*09:28.220- 09:34.720* :  quarter, perhaps even less. So the pressure that has been mounting is likely to increase
*09:34.720- 09:40.320* :  from the families and the friends and from society in general, of those still left behind.
*09:40.620- 09:44.720* :  There'll be political process, which says it's harder to keep the offensive going if there's
*09:44.720- 09:49.780* :  a possibility of hostages coming out, which is of course, presumably why Hamas took hostages
*09:49.780- 09:57.560* :  to use as leverage over Israeli authorities and the Israeli people. Exactly. So this leverage
*09:57.560- 10:04.780* :  as long as Israel was holding out not to do any deal, it was latent leverage. It wasn't coming to
*10:04.780- 10:11.700* :  the fore. Now we're in the deal making space. That leverage very much takes center ground.
*10:11.700- 10:17.520* :  The pressure in Israel changes. Perhaps we will see over time a shift in American,
*10:17.520- 10:21.960* :  British and other positions. When you see this extended period of quiet, maybe there will be
*10:21.960- 10:27.000* :  more pressure to actually get to a ceasefire because the alternative as Israel pushes
*10:27.580- 10:33.600* :  it's offensive and continues its offensive and it moves south to the areas of Gaza where the
*10:33.600- 10:38.520* :  entirety of the population have now been pushed to. A smaller space with a larger number of people,
*10:38.820- 10:44.360* :  the likelihood is that there will be even more staggering civilian losses, casualties
*10:44.360- 10:48.480* :  amongst children than we have already seen in this horrendous last few weeks of fighting.
*10:49.020- 10:52.700* :  President of the US Middle East project, Daniel Levy.
*10:53.500- 10:59.580* :  A Sampeed at a stadium in the Republic of Congo has left at least 37 people dead and many
*10:59.580- 11:05.040* :  others injured. After the army announced a recruitment drive, thousands of young men had
*11:05.040- 11:10.520* :  flocked to the stadium in the capital of Brazaville and queued for hours, hoping they would be picked.
*11:11.280- 11:17.380* :  Instead, many lost their lives. Despite being rich in oil, Congo has high levels of unemployment
*11:17.380- 11:23.600* :  with the army regarded as one of the country's few reliable employers. Our Africa regional editor
*11:23.600- 11:30.480* :  Will Ross told us more about what was known about the accident. Evidence from survivors seems to
*11:30.480- 11:36.580* :  point to the fact that many people were stuck outside this stadium in the centre of Brazaville
*11:37.060- 11:43.620* :  all day on Monday and some apparently grew frustrated at the end of the day and then tried to force
*11:43.620- 11:48.780* :  their way in. There are some reports of people climbing over a wall, others talk of a gate
*11:48.780- 11:54.420* :  being pushed in and then some survivors said that there was then a kind of crash and people were
*11:54.420- 12:00.740* :  trampled on. Surprising in a way that it took, I think this happened around 11 o'clock local time
*12:00.740- 12:06.460* :  on Monday evening and yet it was 10, 11 hours until we'd heard anything about it.
*12:07.780- 12:13.060* :  But we're kind of waiting to hear about an official inquiry that the authorities say they're
*12:13.060- 12:18.980* :  going to launch to find out exactly what the cause was. And I think I'm correct in saying that
*12:18.980- 12:25.100* :  this was supposed to be the last day of this army recruitment drive. So perhaps people had felt
*12:25.100- 12:30.860* :  quite desperate because there are many job prospects in Congo and many people there are desperately poor.
*12:31.960- 12:38.140* :  Yes and it's possible, we're not totally sure as to how many days the active recruitment was going
*12:38.140- 12:45.420* :  on but certainly last week the military announced that they were after 1500 recruits between the ages
*12:45.420- 12:52.640* :  of 18 and 25 and they said that will go on for several days. But yes it is difficult to find a job
*12:52.640- 12:59.380* :  especially for people in that age group. Unemployment officially is over 20% but possibly quite a lot
*12:59.380- 13:04.060* :  higher for people leaving school or people who have not made it to the end of school and have reached
*13:04.140- 13:11.760* :  age 18. So joining the armed forces is a very tempting prospect and in many countries across
*13:11.760- 13:16.180* :  Africa when there's a recruitment drive like this for the army or perhaps for the police,
*13:16.180- 13:21.780* :  you see extraordinary numbers of people turn up because of the desire to get a formal job.
*13:22.260- 13:28.360* :  Will Ross, since 2019 more than 20 people are thought to have died after flying from Britain to
*13:28.360- 13:33.420* :  Turkey for cosmetic surgery procedures. Now the UK government has said it's planning to hold
*13:33.420- 13:39.080* :  talks with the Turkish authorities to see what can be done to prevent more such deaths. Stephanie
*13:39.080- 13:45.960* :  Prentice reports. A gluteal muscle lift known to insiders as the Brazilian butt lift involves a
*13:45.960- 13:51.920* :  transfer of fat into the buttock area. It's one of the fastest growing cosmetic surgery procedures
*13:51.920- 13:58.860* :  but also one of the most dangerous as it's easy to accidentally inject fat into a vein. That's
*13:58.860- 14:05.160* :  what happened to one British woman who died undergoing the procedure back in 2019 and this week
*14:05.160- 14:10.080* :  a coroner ruled she wasn't given enough information beforehand to make a safe decision.
*14:10.080- 14:15.920* :  The case is prompted officials to step in and say they'll be visiting Turkey shortly to discuss
*14:15.920- 14:21.700* :  surgery regulations around all cosmetic tourism. That follows the UK government warning already
*14:21.700- 14:28.720* :  in place after 25 deaths were recorded since 2019. Kimberly Sadd spoke to the BBC about her
*14:28.720- 14:34.140* :  experience getting breast implants and a tummy tuck in Turkey. It was 9 o'clock in the morning as soon
*14:34.140- 14:39.180* :  as I woke up the surgeon said you have to go didn't give me no garments there was no
*14:39.180- 14:44.460* :  talks about what to do afterwards with myself. I went back to the hotel and I started seeing
*14:44.460- 14:50.120* :  blood like just growing onto my pads. I had a look and my stitches had popped up and around my
*14:51.120- 14:57.060* :  Kimberly was left with an infection but survived, unlike one English woman who bled to death during
*14:57.060- 15:03.360* :  the gluteal surgery in July. Her family is still fighting for justice and to see a full autopsy.
*15:03.680- 15:09.860* :  While many surgeries are executed without issues the dangers are documented but hundreds of thousands
*15:09.860- 15:16.180* :  of people travel there every year for one major reason. As Dr Nora Nugent, VP of the British
*15:16.180- 15:22.280* :  Association of Esthetic Plastic Surgeons explains. Overwhelmingly the reason is price
*15:22.960- 15:27.220* :  and there are a few reasons why there's such a price differential but it is the main driving factor.
*15:27.680- 15:32.360* :  We asked her if people travelling there are given enough information in her opinion about the
*15:32.360- 15:38.840* :  procedure and about the surgeon. No, in the UK I can easily advise someone how to look up and see
*15:38.840- 15:43.640* :  the summons a legitimate plastic surgeon that are hospital of this legitimate. It's much more
*15:43.640- 15:48.940* :  difficult in other countries and even if you go to the best surgeon in the world if you cannot
*15:48.940- 15:54.780* :  receive the aftercare then it all of this is a move point of a complication happens.
*15:55.180- 16:01.100* :  Complications do happen but with the Brazilian butt lift costing around $4,000 in Turkey
*16:01.580- 16:06.940* :  and double that in other countries health officials have a fight on their hands to explain to people
*16:06.940- 16:11.900* :  that the price may not be worth the cost. Stephanie Prentice.
*16:12.860- 16:18.860* :  Residents of a Dutch city have been warned that an extremely venomous two metre long green
*16:18.860- 16:25.300* :  member snake is on the loose. Police in Tilburg were alerted by the members owner on Monday night
*16:25.300- 16:31.160* :  who informed them that quote he was missing a snake. Ed Horton reports.
*16:31.880- 16:37.540* :  A wanted poster with a mug shot of the coiled green member has been issued by police warning
*16:37.540- 16:43.540* :  people that the snake is very dangerous it's bite extremely venomous. Anyone who does get bitten
*16:43.540- 16:48.900* :  has been urged to seek immediate medical attention reassuringly perhaps the cold-blooded reptile
*16:49.240- 16:55.020* :  is unlikely to go outdoors during the chilly Dutch winter and is apparently more likely to seek out
*16:55.020- 17:01.440* :  warm dark spaces and if it finds that comfort police have assured people it will be passive
*17:01.440- 17:11.500* :  and is not out to seek confrontation. Ed Horton. Still to come? I just wonder back in my arms

*18:21.820- 18:28.380* :  With me, Alan, Kasutja, and Africa Daily. So what's it like living in an area with Boko Harama
*18:28.380- 18:35.640* :  active? One story from Africa. For Africa. Our story. Africa Daily. That's Africa Daily from
*18:35.640- 18:39.960* :  the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get to BBC Podcasts.
*18:41.840- 18:46.040* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The chief executive of the world's largest
*18:46.140- 18:52.480* :  currency exchange, Binance, has pleaded guilty to charges of violating antique money laundering
*18:52.480- 18:59.760* :  rules as part of a $4 billion settlement with U.S. regulators. Changping Zhao, who appeared in a
*18:59.760- 19:06.400* :  federal court in Seattle, is expected to stand down and to pay a huge fine himself as our New York
*19:06.400- 19:13.860* :  Business Correspondent Erin Damour, explained. It's a $50 million fine for CZ. As he's known,
*19:14.020- 19:18.680* :  he will step down from his role as the chief executive of Binance, the world's largest
*19:18.680- 19:25.540* :  cryptocurrency trading platform. Binance itself will pay a $4.3 billion fine. The company will also
*19:25.540- 19:31.360* :  accept the appointment of a monitor. And this deal ends years of investigations into Binance.
*19:31.640- 19:36.600* :  Now the company pleaded guilty to knowingly failing to prevent money laundering and sanctions
*19:36.600- 19:41.240* :  violations and allowing criminal actors to use the exchange. Those were named today in a press
*19:41.240- 19:46.740* :  conference by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as including Al Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas.
*19:47.060- 19:52.080* :  And Attorney General Merrick Garland did not mince words today. He said that Binance prioritized
*19:52.080- 19:56.320* :  its profits over the safety of the American people and he said that it grew to be the largest
*19:56.320- 20:00.920* :  crypto exchange in part because of the crimes it committed. He said now the company is paying
*20:00.920- 20:06.900* :  one of the biggest corporate penalties in U.S. history. But it is still being allowed to carry on
*20:07.120- 20:10.200* :  a trading although it will have to accept the appointment of a monitor.
*20:11.200- 20:15.920* :  Exactly. It will accept the appointment of a monitor and Mr. Zhao will not be able to have his
*20:15.920- 20:20.800* :  hands on the business for quite some time now for years. And there are going to be implications
*20:20.800- 20:25.640* :  for the wider crypto industry here because Mr. Zhao is one of the most influential and most
*20:25.640- 20:30.880* :  powerful figures in this industry. And this is not the first big shock wave that we've seen
*20:30.880- 20:36.940* :  to crypto. Even this month, remember Sam Bankman-Free who was the founder of the FTX crypto exchange
*20:36.940- 20:42.580* :  was found guilty of fraud and money laundering earlier this month. And so these are some major
*20:42.580- 20:48.520* :  shocks to go through the crypto world today was easy. So what does this tell us about the state
*20:48.520- 20:55.200* :  of cryptocurrency trading and how is it doing right now? Well, with crypto right now, a lot of the
*20:55.200- 20:59.780* :  conversation revolves around enforcement here in the United States and regulation. And in fact,
*20:59.780- 21:04.480* :  when we saw the Sam Bankman-Free trial going on in the U.S., there were a lot of calls for greater
*21:04.480- 21:09.500* :  regulation in this industry. You know, it's something that has to be worked out in Washington
*21:10.180- 21:15.300* :  and in line with the with the regular financial system here, but you see a lot of push and pull.
*21:15.360- 21:20.520* :  And when I talk to sources who include former federal prosecutors and other defense attorneys,
*21:20.520- 21:26.200* :  they say that there's a lot of work to be done. Aaron Dammall, the UK's largest library, the
*21:26.200- 21:32.060* :  British library, has confirmed that employee data was taken in a cyber attack almost a month ago
*21:32.500- 21:38.000* :  and that it's still affecting services. The RICEDO and someware group claims it has library
*21:38.000- 21:43.920* :  staffs passport information and is auctioning access to this and other data files for around
*21:43.920- 21:50.620* :  $800,000 on the dark web. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims. Here's our
*21:50.620- 21:56.060* :  technology editor, Zoe Kleinman. The British library is the country's largest housing a copy
*21:56.060- 22:01.860* :  of every single book published in the UK and Ireland. At the end of October, it was hit by a simple
*22:01.860- 22:07.540* :  but nasty ransomware attack, believed to have come from a Russian group. Ransomware is malicious
*22:07.540- 22:13.560* :  software, often sent by criminals via attachments in emails and used to gain access to a computer
*22:13.560- 22:19.940* :  or network. The sender can then find and encrypt important or sensitive files and demand a ransom
*22:19.940- 22:25.340* :  for them to be unlocked. Professor Kieran Martin is the former head of the National Cyber Security
*22:25.340- 22:31.320* :  Centre which is assisting the library. He says it has not paid the ransom, so the group is now
*22:31.320- 22:36.380* :  on to plan B. Now the criminals are threatening to sell the data to other criminals and that
*22:36.380- 22:40.720* :  second threat is probably hollow. The data doesn't seem to be worth very much, so the library
*22:40.720- 22:44.420* :  has made the right decision if they pay, the criminals will just come back for other British
*22:44.420- 22:49.740* :  institutions. The attack has affected the library's website, online systems, Wi-Fi and services
*22:49.740- 22:54.780* :  such as book ordering. The organisation has warned the disruption could continue for several weeks.
*22:55.300- 23:01.040* :  Zoe Kleinman, the doctor heading to the polls to vote in a snap parliamentary election that will
*23:01.080- 23:06.100* :  bring in the first new Prime Minister in over a decade. The previous Prime Minister,
*23:06.100- 23:10.880* :  Mark Russo, whose government collapsed in July over differences in how to reduce the flow of
*23:10.880- 23:17.060* :  asylum seekers, is not standing. So there's a sense of a new era beginning in Dutch politics,
*23:17.060- 23:23.060* :  but whoever takes the helm will face an urgent to-do list as Anna Holligan reports.
*23:23.060- 23:29.540* :  The dominant themes in this election campaign have been the price of groceries, energy,
*23:29.540- 23:34.840* :  a shortage of social and affordable housing and access to health care.
*23:35.020- 23:40.860* :  These issues have merged into one catch all-term security of existence.
*23:47.240- 23:50.880* :  Hi, Judith, it's Anna. I've come to visit Judith's honing.
*23:52.360- 23:56.540* :  So many plans are so much light. You're a lovely place. Thank you.
*23:57.400- 23:59.940* :  Who's constantly thinking about ways to save money?
*24:01.560- 24:06.040* :  Well, I can only spend my money once, so I had to make choices.
*24:07.200- 24:13.740* :  And heating is so expensive that if I turn on the heating,
*24:15.500- 24:19.580* :  I don't have enough money to buy food. I haven't turned on the heating in two years.
*24:21.020- 24:25.220* :  I also don't take hot showers every day. I do wash myself every day,
*24:25.260- 24:32.320* :  but I have a system with a bucket that I fill up in a small scoop. I use to
*24:34.080- 24:37.960* :  pour the water over me because it's a lot more energy-efficient.
*24:39.340- 24:45.940* :  Don't use electric appliances as much. Go to bed early. I often share my bed with my daughter
*24:46.420- 24:48.520* :  because it's just warmer to share.
*24:49.460- 24:54.780* :  What would happen if you did turn on the heating and if you didn't make those sacrifices?
*24:57.620- 25:02.180* :  I either wouldn't be able to pay the bills or I wouldn't be able to eat.
*25:03.920- 25:09.880* :  Billboards for the 26th parties have been placed to outside Parliament, so let's just take you
*25:09.880- 25:15.640* :  through some of the front runners. Peter Amsicht, his new social contract party, was only formed
*25:15.640- 25:22.040* :  a few months ago, but Paul suggests it could do well. Franz Timmermans, he gave up an EU job to
*25:22.040- 25:28.960* :  lead a new alliance between Labour and the Green Left. Geert Wilders, known for his populist
*25:28.960- 25:34.560* :  anti-immigration policies, said his freedom party would be prepared to compromise as part of a
*25:34.560- 25:41.120* :  coalition and Dylan Yastiel-Gos. She took over from Margrosa as leader of the centre-right
*25:41.120- 25:47.400* :  conservative VVD and could become the Netherlands's first female and first immigrant Prime Minister.
*25:49.120- 25:54.180* :  A video of her sparring with a heavyweight boxing champion was shared as part of the campaign.
*25:54.280- 26:00.420* :  Dylan Yastiel-Gos came to the Netherlands from Turkey as a child refugee but has adopted a hard
*26:00.420- 26:07.500* :  line on immigration. Across the Dutch political spectrum though, anti-migration policies are
*26:07.500- 26:14.600* :  discussed in pragmatic rather than inflammatory terms and this debate has been overshadowed by daily
*26:14.600- 26:19.440* :  challenges. So this is where you teach? Yes, this is where I teach. My name is Asha, Asha
*26:19.440- 26:24.660* :  from their home. As we traipse through Otonna leaves, Asha tells me about her experience,
*26:24.680- 26:31.400* :  which is not uncommon. Seven months of hardworking, 35 houses visited, I think.
*26:31.860- 26:36.680* :  And it was the competition, too much competition. You're basically
*26:37.400- 26:41.600* :  fighting for your position in this market. Buying wasn't an option. No, buying wasn't
*26:41.600- 26:47.180* :  an option because I am a teacher and on a teacher's salary nowadays in Holland, you cannot get a
*26:47.540- 26:52.160* :  mortgage high enough to afford to buy any of the houses here in Holland.
*26:52.840- 26:57.960* :  Polls suggest a majority of Dutch people, even those on middle incomes, are concerned about
*26:57.960- 27:02.920* :  the future and what they want most is a government that can secure their existence.
*27:04.780- 27:10.760* :  Anna Holigen reporting, let's return to our main story now, the events in Israel and Gaza.
*27:11.140- 27:15.680* :  Among the relatives of the Israeli hostages, desperate to hear some good news after weeks
*27:15.680- 27:22.360* :  of agony is Tom Hand. His nine-year-old daughter, Emily, is believed to be one of those being
*27:22.360- 27:28.980* :  held by Hamas. My colleague, Sarah Montague, asked him how he felt after the statement by the Hamas
*27:28.980- 27:35.100* :  leader Ismail Haneer that an agreement on a ceasefire and a hostage release was close.
*27:35.740- 27:40.160* :  To be honest, I haven't heard it. I don't have time to hear anything like that.
*27:40.940- 27:48.340* :  But when I do hear things like that, my hopes are raised to the sky and then when it doesn't
*27:48.340- 27:55.520* :  happen, I'm crushed to the ground. I'm not going up to the highs because the lows are too bad.
*27:55.520- 27:59.780* :  So until I see it happening with my own eyes, I won't believe it.
*28:00.180- 28:03.680* :  Have you heard anything about the possibility of how talks are going?
*28:04.560- 28:10.080* :  No, nothing at all. No. For Emily, I think she would have turned nine the other day.
*28:11.180- 28:18.420* :  Nine on the 17th of November. Tell us about her. Tell us when you think of her. What do you think of?
*28:22.900- 28:30.740* :  I just want to back in my arms and squeeze the life out of her. I miss her singing and dancing
*28:30.740- 28:40.040* :  and performing her energy zest for life, even through her tragic upbringing.
*28:41.120- 28:45.020* :  Before she was two and a half, she'd lost her granddad through cancer,
*28:45.820- 28:50.580* :  her uncle through cancer, and then finally her mother, her through breast cancer.
*28:51.100- 28:56.680* :  She had the hell of a memory. She still remembers her mum in the house.
*28:56.780- 29:00.200* :  Everyone has their own little seats where they sit and she still remembers
*29:02.280- 29:05.640* :  where her mum would sit. She's like, oh, you're sitting in a month's place.
*29:06.380- 29:15.180* :  So I'd have to move. Did you have any sense of risk where you lived? Because you were obviously
*29:15.180- 29:21.860* :  close to Gaza. Was there any sense? Yeah, I've had the sense of risk since I got there.
*29:22.700- 29:28.040* :  I mean, her whole life she's lived there. From the age of two and a half to now,
*29:28.880- 29:32.560* :  nine years old, she lived and kept us buried with me.
*29:33.160- 29:36.260* :  You were on a tour. I mean, you come from Israel. You've obviously been in the United States.
*29:36.260- 29:41.840* :  You're here in London. You're trying to raise awareness of the situation of the hostages.
*29:42.640- 29:46.780* :  How do you feel about the way your own government, the Israeli government is handling it?
*29:47.960- 29:53.200* :  I have every confidence in the Israeli government doing absolutely everything possible
*29:53.200- 29:59.680* :  under the sand to get the hostages back. You may know that there were a group of families of
*29:59.680- 30:08.820* :  hostages who met with lawmakers yesterday and it ended up being with them shouting at each other
*30:08.820- 30:12.980* :  because there was fury on the part of the hostages family. A man whose wife and daughter
*30:12.980- 30:18.160* :  being held begged them to stop talking about killing Arabs and start speaking about saving Jews.
*30:19.100- 30:22.860* :  Yeah, my daughter was one of the ones going to see
*30:23.600- 30:31.600* :  BB Netanyahu, the emotions of the families, I guess, got the better of them and it was all
*30:31.600- 30:37.700* :  canceled or something. Right, they walked out. I have no idea, but you know, you've got to understand
*30:37.700- 30:46.260* :  their emotions. They've lost their children, mothers, family loved ones. They've lost and, you know,
*30:47.200- 30:53.180* :  probably got too emotional. And the idea of a prisoner swap, which has been suggested that there
*30:53.180- 31:00.220* :  would be Palestinian women and children released from Israeli jails. Absolutely fine. Yeah, no problem,
*31:00.220- 31:08.160* :  give them what they want. That was Tom Hand, the father of nine-year-old Emily who's been kidnapped
*31:08.160- 31:15.480* :  by Hamas. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News
*31:15.480- 31:21.660* :  Podcast later. Now, as the next UN summit on climate change approaches, we're making a special
*31:21.660- 31:27.080* :  edition of the Global News Podcast looking at where the world has got to in its efforts to tackle
*31:27.080- 31:32.020* :  the problem. So we want your questions, which we're putting to two of our science and climate
*31:32.020- 31:36.820* :  experts. What would you like to know about the changing climate or about how these summits work?
*31:37.420- 31:42.820* :  Do you think our leaders are responding in the right way? And what would you ask them if you were
*31:42.820- 31:47.980* :  there? We'd love to hear from you wherever you are in the world, so do please send an email with
*31:47.980- 31:55.920* :  your question to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. And if you can, it would be great if you could include
