*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.560* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.520- 00:23.740* :  I'm Janet Gillian at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday 29th of November. These are our main stories.
*00:24.560- 00:29.100* :  There are reports of heavy gunfire in the city of Janine in the occupied West Bank as
*00:29.100- 00:34.920* :  the Israeli Army conducts an operation in the main refugee camp there. A study by the European
*00:34.920- 00:42.040* :  Union finds out who faces most online hate and abuse. The policy of the former Pakistani
*00:42.040- 00:47.900* :  Prime Minister Imran Khan says he stepped down as chairman to focus on his legal woes.
*00:50.400- 00:55.020* :  Also in this podcast, after Australia's Prime Minister apologises for the Thalidomide
*00:55.020- 01:01.600* :  scandal, we hear how the drug continues to affect survivors. It impacts every single minute
*01:01.600- 01:06.340* :  of every single day of my life. To do simplest things like brush my teeth, I stand on my left
*01:06.380- 01:08.920* :  leg and raise my right leg and put it up onto the basin.
*01:13.940- 01:19.280* :  While the fragile truth between Israel and Hamas now into its sixth day appears to be holding
*01:19.280- 01:25.300* :  in Gaza, violence appears to be escalating in the other Palestinian territory, the occupied West
*01:25.300- 01:32.300* :  Bank. Officials say two children have been killed in the city of Janine as Israeli troops continue
*01:32.300- 01:38.240* :  their military operation in the main refugee camp there. Soldiers are reported to have surrounded
*01:38.240- 01:44.140* :  a house and fired on the residents. Two people were detained. One of them is said to be a member
*01:44.140- 01:50.620* :  of an armed group called the Janine Battalion. Hospitals are also reported to have been under siege.
*01:50.920- 01:56.380* :  A senior official from the ruling Fata party in the West Bank, Sabri Saddam, told my colleague
*01:56.380- 02:00.340* :  Lucy Hockings about the impact the Israeli operation was having there.
*02:01.120- 02:06.320* :  The situation is extremely dire. The expansion of operation is in clear defiance
*02:06.320- 02:12.280* :  or the truth that exists and the agreement of seizing fire for the time being. And one does not
*02:12.280- 02:17.460* :  understand as to why such operation takes such magnitude at such critical time. To my knowledge,
*02:17.480- 02:23.600* :  there's three hospitals that have been blocked and been sealed out. So people can't even move the
*02:23.600- 02:29.880* :  injured into the vicinity of the hospital since the Israeli vehicles are blocking the way there.
*02:30.660- 02:36.880* :  How is the Palestinian Authority responding to these allegations of Palestinian groups operating
*02:36.880- 02:41.640* :  in some of these civilian areas as well, which is obviously heightening tensions, putting people
*02:41.640- 02:48.280* :  at risk? You cannot say that the Palestinians have invoked anything for the last week or so.
*02:48.800- 02:53.140* :  And in the course of the last few weeks since the 7th of October, it's been Israel that's been
*02:53.660- 02:57.240* :  initiating attacks against the Palestinians. There's no way that you can talk about
*02:57.240- 03:02.860* :  truth in Gaza and provoke people in the West Bank. If anything, Israel is interested in heating up
*03:03.300- 03:08.720* :  the front in the West Bank so that it finishes with Gaza at times, it's attention to the West Bank
*03:09.280- 03:14.480* :  and conduct a wider military operation with different scales. Plus the violence settlers,
*03:14.480- 03:20.620* :  the settlers' violence rather is increasing. And that's causing major concern as well among
*03:20.620- 03:26.020* :  Palestinians. And there's been posters around that have been circulated in the streets of the
*03:26.020- 03:32.140* :  West Bank by settlers calling upon Palestinians to leave the West Bank. So this is a major displacement
*03:32.140- 03:38.120* :  project that Israel is advocating. Sabri Saddam, Deputy Secretary General of Fata Central Committee.
*03:38.800- 03:43.340* :  Our correspondent, Injuslim Wehradavis, told us what more was known about the Israeli military
*03:43.340- 03:48.940* :  operation in Janine. Yeah, the piece of this is an Israeli military operation against what it
*03:49.140- 03:55.360* :  regards as terrorists, Palestinian militants inside Janine. The news coming out of there is unclear
*03:55.360- 04:00.720* :  at points, but several medical workers and ambulances on the ground have said they found it difficult
*04:00.720- 04:05.420* :  to take the wounded to hospital at some points because they said they were denied in doing so by
*04:05.420- 04:09.120* :  Israeli soldiers so that we know there have been at least a couple of fatalities in Janine,
*04:09.120- 04:14.460* :  but these are continuing Israeli military operations against Palestinian militants. And these kind
*04:14.460- 04:20.520* :  of things are being going on ever since October the 7th with rising anger in the occupied Palestinian
*04:20.520- 04:24.400* :  West Bank and what is happening in and around Gaza. And of course, it shouldn't be forgot.
*04:24.400- 04:29.440* :  Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in these clashes and in shootings by Israeli soldiers
*04:29.960- 04:34.740* :  since the start of the hostilities in Gaza. So of course, much of the world's attention is focused
*04:34.740- 04:40.220* :  on Gaza, but there are increasing tensions as well in cities like Janine in the Palestinian West Bank.
*04:40.520- 04:45.320* :  Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is getting ever more dire. And we've heard from
*04:45.320- 04:50.660* :  aid agencies that have been able to get to northern Gaza to Gaza City saying parts of
*04:50.660- 04:57.120* :  Gaza City are uninhabitable as winter is closing in. Yeah, anybody who's seen the pictures from Gaza
*04:57.120- 05:02.100* :  might appreciate the level of destruction in some parts of northern Gaza about 50% if not more of
*05:02.100- 05:06.980* :  the buildings have been destroyed. But again, one plus side of this continued truth is that it's
*05:06.980- 05:12.580* :  allowed aid agencies to get into Gaza to get in on the ground and to assess the damage not just
*05:12.580- 05:17.420* :  to buildings but to infrastructure to water desalination plants to the sewerage system.
*05:17.920- 05:22.420* :  And of course, more aid has been getting in through the Egyptian border around if not more than
*05:22.420- 05:28.220* :  a hundred trucks a day now bringing in some fuel, food and medical supplies. So that's another reason
*05:28.720- 05:34.040* :  why the aid agencies would also welcome an extension of this truth. You know, the World Health
*05:34.040- 05:39.940* :  Organization has repeated many dire warnings now about the worsening health crisis, particularly
*05:39.940- 05:45.360* :  in those densely populated areas, the camps that have sprung up in southern Gaza, those people
*05:45.360- 05:51.260* :  who left their homes in the north are now congregated and concentrated in very tight areas with
*05:51.260- 05:56.540* :  very poor sanitation. And the WHO at the World Health Organization is desperately worried about the
*05:56.540- 06:00.780* :  worsening health and medical crisis in those refugee areas in the south.
*06:01.560- 06:07.340* :  We were Davis in Jerusalem. Abusive comments, harassment and incitement to violence are often
*06:07.340- 06:13.100* :  in the headlines. Now a new report from the European Union has looked into who is most targeted
*06:13.100- 06:19.840* :  and why these hateful messages managed to slip through online platforms content moderation tools.
*06:20.440- 06:25.640* :  The author is David Reichel, project manager at the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights.
*06:26.120- 06:30.260* :  He told my colleague James Cognore more about his research into online hate.
*06:31.140- 06:37.220* :  For this report, we collected data on online hate targeted at women and selected ethnic minorities
*06:37.220- 06:43.360* :  through dedicated keyword search and covered for platforms in for human mistakes and out of
*06:43.620- 06:48.020* :  over three hundred and forty thousand posts that we collected we selected some one thousand
*06:48.020- 06:54.040* :  six hundred for further analysis. And there what we found was quite widespread online hate.
*06:54.380- 06:59.040* :  So it was more than than half of the posts were considered as hateful by human coders.
*06:59.840- 07:04.560* :  And that include a variety of forms of online hate including mostly offensive speech.
*07:05.540- 07:11.260* :  But we also found elements of incitement to violence, to discrimination and hatred in 16% of the
*07:11.260- 07:16.980* :  cases. And also denigration, the meaning of people were compared to object or animals.
*07:17.700- 07:23.740* :  And a lot of negative stereotyping. The main finding was in a way was that hate targeted at women
*07:23.740- 07:28.640* :  was found to be most prevalent across all the platforms we covered. And that most often included
*07:28.640- 07:33.560* :  denigrating language. But women also face higher levels of incitement to violence than the other
*07:33.560- 07:38.960* :  groups. However targeted at ethnic minorities they most often contain negative stereotyping.
*07:39.520- 07:44.280* :  And what is more important that in almost half of the hateful posts we found direct harassment
*07:44.280- 07:49.760* :  was included. And that means that specific individuals were targeted with the messages.
*07:50.480- 07:55.440* :  And that again was especially high for women with two-thirds of the hateful posts found to be
*07:55.440- 08:01.120* :  targeting specific persons. These are very very shocking findings. But I'm tempted to say not
*08:01.120- 08:08.560* :  surprising for people who do log on or perhaps people who suffer these the sorts of abuse. Why
*08:08.560- 08:13.980* :  though are these messages allowed to proliferate on social media platforms?
*08:14.640- 08:19.700* :  This research underlines how difficult it is to tackle online hate speech. And that's for
*08:19.700- 08:24.460* :  several reasons. I mean first there's often no clear understanding of online hate.
*08:25.320- 08:30.000* :  So the coders we used they reached a relatively high level of agreement in their categorizations.
*08:30.000- 08:35.220* :  But they still faced some uncertainty in one out of five posts they tried to assess.
*08:35.840- 08:40.240* :  In addition there was a disagreement also to some extent between the coders and legal experts
*08:40.240- 08:45.600* :  we employed about whether certain posts fall under the definition of incitement to violence for
*08:45.600- 08:51.740* :  example. And this is a challenge because current content moderation practices they have to
*08:51.740- 08:56.140* :  react quickly and often make assessments without being able to consider all the factors surrounding
*08:56.140- 09:00.440* :  certain expressions. And that's also reason why often hate still slips through.
*09:02.200- 09:08.240* :  So challenges then for those who want to stop hate but it's clear isn't it that this hatred
*09:08.840- 09:13.320* :  is so widespread that it's having a really damaging effect on societies everywhere really.
*09:15.040- 09:20.920* :  Yes exactly. I mean that's how people engage online in a way and I found it particularly
*09:20.920- 09:27.060* :  concerning how easy it is to find online hate. And especially the way people address women online.
*09:27.380- 09:33.040* :  Although with our methodology of course we also missed a certain speech because we only use
*09:33.040- 09:37.860* :  specific keywords and online hate also happens in other more subtle ways. Yet still the often
*09:37.980- 09:42.540* :  sexualized violent language targeted at women is for sure a major concern.
*09:43.500- 09:47.220* :  David Reichel project manager at the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights.
*09:48.400- 09:53.580* :  The UN's latest climate conference gets underway on Thursday and many will be looking at China's
*09:53.580- 09:59.440* :  rapidly growing number of coal power stations in dismay. But the country has also been rolling out
*09:59.440- 10:05.020* :  vast new green energy projects outstripping government targets. And Beijing is positioning
*10:05.020- 10:10.140* :  itself to dominate the global supply of clean energy products like electric vehicles.
*10:10.820- 10:15.840* :  However as our China correspondent Stephen McDonald reports there's still a looming battle
*10:15.840- 10:24.740* :  with a country's powerful coal sector. Standing in the street in Beijing you can see the extent of
*10:24.740- 10:31.820* :  the take-up of electric cars easily. There's one two more close behind. You don't have to be a car
*10:31.820- 10:37.820* :  expert to spot them. They have a special green number plates and there are 18 million already
*10:37.820- 10:43.580* :  on the road. This year nearly one in three passenger vehicles sold in China has said to have been
*10:43.580- 10:53.080* :  electric. 44-year-old Zheng Jiu who works in real estate has owned several. Many in my family have
*10:53.080- 10:57.880* :  replaced their petrol cars with electric vehicles and they're not going back.
*10:59.860- 11:05.520* :  As we drive around suburban Beijing explains that government tax breaks kept prices down at the
*11:05.520- 11:13.140* :  beginning and that other incentives have helped make the industry viable. I'm asking about the
*11:13.140- 11:21.140* :  problem of having to charge the battery. In the past two years the speed of building charging
*11:21.140- 11:25.880* :  stations has been very fast. There are now more of them than petrol stations.
*11:34.780- 11:40.200* :  A three and a half hour flight away in the south of the country a huge auto show in Guangzhou gives
*11:40.200- 11:46.020* :  you an idea of the money pouring into the electric vehicle industry. Half of the entire exhibition
*11:46.020- 11:52.100* :  is made up of electric cars. Many of them new brands that most will not have heard of. Certainly
*11:52.100- 11:57.140* :  the sales people on the floor of this cabin of space are talking up the bright future for China's
*11:57.140- 12:05.640* :  EVs which they expect to dominate globally in the years to come. We can cut manufacturing costs
*12:05.640- 12:13.800* :  and also make sure our EVs are good quality. And the electricity driving China's electric cars
*12:13.820- 12:20.420* :  is coming increasingly from non fossil fuel sources including hydro, solar and wind which
*12:20.420- 12:25.960* :  today deliver nearly half of the country's power. It's highly visible in the provinces to the north
*12:25.960- 12:33.680* :  of Beijing where the wind hows down off the Mongolian plateau. I'm standing on the hill looking
*12:33.740- 12:41.880* :  down over Quantin Lake and all around it there are wind turbines and passing through
*12:43.660- 12:52.600* :  cold trains and you can just hear by the constant sound how long the trains are. Here you have
*12:53.600- 13:01.540* :  China's energy mix in a nutshell, the old and the new. The cold trains passing through fields
*13:02.520- 13:09.340* :  filled with wind turbines. This challenge from renewable energy is expected to attract
*13:09.340- 13:14.960* :  a level of pushback from fossil fuel companies. The recent boost in renewable energies in China
*13:14.960- 13:21.820* :  has been phenomenal. For 12 years in a row it's had more installed wind power than anywhere else.
*13:22.320- 13:28.220* :  The country makes up 40% of all solar power produced in the world. According to the carbon
*13:28.220- 13:34.340* :  brief website, China's overall carbon emissions could peak then start falling years
*13:34.340- 13:38.440* :  early than expected. Lowery Muleverta was the report's author.
*13:39.200- 13:45.020* :  If China keeps up the current rate of additions of clean energy, emissions should fall next year
*13:45.360- 13:49.400* :  which would be well ahead of the schedule of the Beijing emissions before 2030.
*13:53.260- 13:58.860* :  It could be a fight-looming. For years China had been gradually moving away from fossil fuel
*13:58.860- 14:05.440* :  output but has reversed this and new approvals for coal-fired power stations have skyrocketed.
*14:05.960- 14:10.080* :  There is a risk that when all of these new coal-fired power plants get added,
*14:10.080- 14:15.540* :  you have powerful state-owned enterprises that have made investments, that have an interest in
*14:15.540- 14:20.780* :  making use of those investments so they will push back however the clean energy industry has
*14:20.780- 14:26.100* :  grown much much bigger and more powerful and there no was over anymore.
*14:26.560- 14:32.840* :  So we could be set for a showdown over whose electricity gets used to make China's ever-expanding
*14:32.840- 14:39.500* :  needs with implications for the entire planet. That report by Stephen McDonald.
*14:40.540- 14:45.660* :  More than 60 years after the Thalidomide scandal first erupted, the Australian Prime Minister
*14:45.660- 14:50.820* :  Anthony Albanese has issued a national apology to those affected by the scandal.
*14:51.340- 14:56.320* :  The drug touted as a treatment for morning sickness was given to pregnant women around the world
*14:56.320- 15:02.320* :  in the 1950s and early 60s but it was then taken off the market after scientists found it had
*15:02.320- 15:08.840* :  led to thousands of babies being born with severe disabilities, usually in the form of shortened,
*15:08.840- 15:15.720* :  malformed limbs. Mr Albanese called it one of the darkest chapters in Australia's medical history.
*15:16.460- 15:21.680* :  We are sorry for the harm and the hurt and the hardship you have endured.
*15:22.560- 15:29.480* :  We are sorry for all the cruelty you have had to bear. We are sorry for all the opportunities
*15:30.440- 15:35.740* :  you have been denied. We are sorry for the battle you have had to fight.
*15:36.640- 15:40.520* :  A financial assistance programme for survivors was only set up a few years ago
*15:41.160- 15:46.340* :  and then closed to new applicants but Australia says it will now re-open it for survivors like
*15:46.340- 15:52.400* :  Trish Jackson. She described how Thalidomide had affected her to my colleague James Coppano.
*15:53.080- 15:58.000* :  I can use my little left hand. It can do a few things. My right little arm doesn't do anything
*15:58.000- 16:03.760* :  and I'm also right-footed so left-handed and right-footed. It impacts every single minute of
*16:03.760- 16:08.040* :  every single day of my life. You know, doing everyday things, you know, I have to
*16:08.040- 16:16.660* :  contour my body in very weird ways to do simplest things like brush my teeth. I stand on my left leg
*16:16.660- 16:20.940* :  and raise my right leg and put it up onto the basin and because I've done that all my life,
*16:20.980- 16:24.420* :  you know, our bodies are just falling apart at a very rapid rate.
*16:25.420- 16:30.200* :  You write and even paint with the paintbrush or the pen between your toes?
*16:31.180- 16:36.380* :  That's correct, yes. I don't remember learning to write but Mum always said that I used my feet
*16:36.380- 16:43.160* :  from day one. So it's amazing how the body compensates for missing limbs. The painting came about
*16:43.160- 16:48.700* :  about seven years ago. I've been painting and it was because I was in a very dark space
*16:48.760- 16:54.160* :  with body paint and I knew that I had to do something to get out of that dark space and so I
*16:54.160- 17:00.880* :  started to take up painting and it's just grown and grown and grown and now I am a student of the
*17:00.880- 17:06.420* :  mouth and foot painters which is absolutely awesome. What does the topology mean to you?
*17:07.020- 17:13.020* :  The topology is a recognition that the government failed to protect the Australian citizens
*17:13.020- 17:19.320* :  and that they're finally after 60 years going to put things right for us. Help with our medical
*17:19.660- 17:25.640* :  costs and just stay today living expenses for extraordinary costs that you know associate with
*17:25.640- 17:31.540* :  our disability. Are those costs quite considerable? Will it make a big difference this sort of
*17:31.540- 17:37.000* :  health for the government? Yes, absolutely. It will make a big difference to our lives. The
*17:37.000- 17:42.040* :  only thing is that the system that they've set up is really hard for us to access and very time
*17:42.040- 17:48.320* :  consuming and very physically demanding to fill in all those forms. So while the apology is awesome,
*17:48.320- 17:53.980* :  they need to, you know, act as well to fix the health fund for us. Make it easier.
*18:00.280- 18:05.720* :  Still to come. All the evidence we have in the archaeological record that men were hunting is the
*18:05.720- 18:10.680* :  exact same evidence we have for women. So if you're not convinced by the archaeological evidence,
*18:10.680- 18:15.520* :  then you're not convinced anyone was hunting. Challenging the myth that prehistoric women stayed
*18:15.520- 18:27.520* :  at home while their men hunted. The BBC has been told that Pakistan's former Prime Minister
*18:27.520- 18:33.720* :  Imran Khan is to step down as chairman of the PTI party. The former cricketing legend was
*18:33.720- 18:39.100* :  ousted as Prime Minister last year and has been in prison on multiple charges since early August.
*18:39.620- 18:42.460* :  He's also been disqualified from standing in the general election.
*18:42.540- 18:47.760* :  A lawyer for the PTI says Mr Khan chose to resign because of legal hurdles.
*18:48.380- 18:53.260* :  A correspondent in Islamabad, Carrie Davies, told us the former Prime Minister's woes began some
*18:53.260- 18:59.240* :  months ago. It's been quite a tumultuous year for Imran Khan. Of course it was in April 2022 that he
*18:59.240- 19:05.020* :  was ousted from his position as Prime Minister in a vote of no confidence. Many analysts saw him
*19:05.020- 19:09.900* :  coming to power originally in Pakistan because of the support he had from the powerful political
*19:09.900- 19:15.340* :  military here in Pakistan often referred to as the establishment and then as a result of
*19:15.340- 19:21.180* :  falling out in that disintegration of that relationship that played a part in him also losing
*19:21.220- 19:27.140* :  that position of power too. But instead of going quietly Imran Khan continued to be quite vocal
*19:27.140- 19:32.900* :  and quite critical of the leadership of the military, then this year in May we saw him being
*19:32.900- 19:38.140* :  arrested for the first time. That led to protests around the country, some of which turned violent
*19:38.620- 19:44.560* :  and some military buildings were attacked. Imran Khan was ultimately let out of prison within a few
*19:44.560- 19:50.520* :  days in that situation but there was a massive crackdown on his party. Many of his senior leadership
*19:50.520- 19:56.340* :  were arrested and then subsequently resigned from the party altogether. Other members of the
*19:56.340- 20:02.460* :  leadership are in prison as Mr Khan is and others are in hiding. Mr Khan himself was arrested again
*20:02.460- 20:07.660* :  at the beginning of August and that was the last time he was seen in public. He has been in prison
*20:07.660- 20:11.980* :  since then originally given bail on the case that he was originally in prison for but he's now
*20:11.980- 20:17.720* :  awaiting trial for multiple other cases that are built up against him. So that's part of the backdrop.
*20:17.720- 20:23.060* :  The other part of this story of course is that Pakistan is due to hold elections. They are now
*20:23.060- 20:29.280* :  scheduled to happen on the 8th of February next year. As you mentioned Imran Khan has been
*20:29.280- 20:34.660* :  disqualified from running and the big problem comes if he stays in the position of party chairman
*20:34.660- 20:40.920* :  while being disqualified the impact that would have on the party. The party itself has been told
*20:40.920- 20:46.120* :  to choose a new chairman within the course of a few days or risk losing. It's very important
*20:46.120- 20:51.360* :  emblem on the ballot paper which is of a cricket bat which many people will be able to recognise
*20:51.360- 20:56.300* :  that's really important for the party and that was a big concern. So we heard from his lawyer
*20:56.740- 21:04.980* :  this morning saying that Imran Khan has decided to step down from that position from the role
*21:04.980- 21:11.060* :  of chairman. Now there's been back and forth with some people in the party over the course of the
*21:11.060- 21:16.440* :  last few hours. Some saying that this is not Imran Khan leaving the party. Of course he will play
*21:16.440- 21:21.480* :  a key role but the big question of course is if Imran Khan has now stepped down from this role
*21:21.900- 21:27.180* :  what will that mean for the party that he founded in the elections in the beginning of next year?
*21:27.700- 21:32.360* :  And briefly Carrie who do you think would replace him? That is the big question and the
*21:32.360- 21:36.860* :  suggestion is that Imran Khan if he's made this decision we'll start to suggest who he wants to
*21:36.860- 21:41.340* :  put in his place. Lots of different names have been bounded around but some of the rumours are
*21:41.340- 21:46.220* :  talking about a lawyer from his own party that would step into that role. The big problem that
*21:46.220- 21:51.340* :  Imran Khan has of course with his party is that he is ultimately the party. There aren't that many
*21:51.340- 21:55.060* :  individuals that are still left in the party that are particularly prominent or well-known
*21:55.640- 22:02.080* :  and if he is out of sight if he is out of the campaign that will pose an issue for the party as
*22:02.080- 22:07.820* :  they are starting to campaign for the general election. Carrie Davies in Islamabad. The myth that
*22:07.820- 22:12.720* :  in prehistoric times men were hunters while women were gatherers has been challenged in recent
*22:12.720- 22:18.280* :  years but it persists. Well two new studies published in the American Anthropologist Journal
*22:18.280- 22:23.600* :  may help to shift the balance. Victoria Uon Kunde spoke to the two authors of the reports
*22:23.600- 22:29.880* :  Dr. Sarah Lacey from the University of Delaware and Dr. Kara Okobok from the University of Notre-Dame.
*22:30.180- 22:36.200* :  First Dr. Lacey. All the evidence we have in the archaeological record that men were hunting is
*22:36.200- 22:41.260* :  the exact same evidence we have for women so if you're not convinced by the archaeological evidence
*22:41.260- 22:48.020* :  then you're not convinced anyone was hunting. It goes to show how hard it is to overturn really
*22:48.020- 22:54.040* :  deep-seated ideas that have been around for a long time not just in the halls of academia but also
*22:54.040- 23:00.240* :  in popular culture. We see these images of man the hunter and woman the gatherer in cartoons
*23:00.240- 23:06.600* :  and in movies and in books and TV shows everything. He who writes history is the one who gets to
*23:06.600- 23:13.600* :  drive the narrative and it was he who wrote this history not she or even any sort of thought of
*23:13.600- 23:20.940* :  what she might be involved in in our evolutionary trajectory. And so if the women were hunting
*23:20.940- 23:28.980* :  why the men just sitting pretty at home? I wish but we were actually arguing that you know there's
*23:28.980- 23:35.580* :  no gendered labor roles so both men and women are hunting everyone's doing the same thing and at
*23:35.580- 23:40.120* :  least that's what it looks like when we look at the archaeological evidence the anatomical evidence
*23:40.120- 23:46.280* :  and the fossils everyone's doing the same behavior. So men are processing hides and women are
*23:46.280- 23:52.480* :  doing ambush hunting. What would they be hunting? Would they be hunting the same size of animals?
*23:53.020- 23:56.480* :  So when we're looking in like the middle pithylytic which is what we associate with knee
*23:56.480- 24:01.580* :  antrotols what they're hunting is kind of what's bioavailable so we often think of woolly mammoths
*24:01.920- 24:06.400* :  but that's you know we have a bit of a bias towards sites that are further north. So they're
*24:06.400- 24:10.200* :  going to be hunting basically the same thing if we're assuming that they're getting the same kind of
*24:10.200- 24:15.620* :  travel patterns on their body. Once we get more into the upper pithylytic which are our own species
*24:16.540- 24:22.180* :  they are innovating more of these kinds of hunting tools that have less wear and tear on the body
*24:22.740- 24:29.140* :  bow and arrows fishing hooks hunting nets and so it's possible that women were then focusing more
*24:29.140- 24:34.780* :  on smaller game but there's no explicit evidence for who's using those tools so that's totally
*24:34.780- 24:39.620* :  conjectural. Yeah I would just also like to add when it came to the big game it wasn't just one
*24:39.620- 24:45.900* :  individual hunting you know a woolly rhinoceros or a woolly mammoth it took the whole group of people
*24:45.900- 24:51.460* :  to take that animal down. How have people been responding to your findings in this new study?
*24:52.540- 24:57.440* :  So it ranges from you know people having really wonderful responses and well as responses of
*24:57.440- 25:01.960* :  such as of course of course everyone was doing everything because you had two in small groups
*25:02.880- 25:08.160* :  to the people who have said really horrible sexist things and in different forms of harassment.
*25:08.840- 25:14.520* :  Things about like well what about child rearing and what were the men just sitting at home or
*25:14.520- 25:23.100* :  women can't run as fast as men and or as strategically thinking as men therefore they would not
*25:23.100- 25:31.400* :  have been as good of hunters. Dr Sarah Lacey and Dr Cara a cop-ock. If you drop on any conversation
*25:31.400- 25:36.360* :  between football fans and you can be almost certain it will turn to VR the technology which is
*25:36.360- 25:42.100* :  intended to help referees decide on penalties and off-sides. Some say it's ruining the game with
*25:42.100- 25:47.480* :  the delays disrupting the flow of matches but now footballing authorities are talking of further
*25:47.480- 25:53.440* :  expanding VR to cover threatens and it's not the only rule change in the offing there are plans
*25:53.440- 25:59.960* :  to introduce 10 minute synbin's for cynical fouls and dissent. My colleague Nick Robinson has
*25:59.960- 26:05.220* :  been talking to Jenny Frampton a former professional referee in men's football and vice president of
*26:05.220- 26:10.520* :  the International Federation of Sports Officials he began by asking her about the synbin proposal.
*26:11.340- 26:15.960* :  I think synbin's is probably a really good idea particularly at the higher levels of the game.
*26:15.960- 26:22.880* :  They trial them at grassroots and yes they were successful as a deterrent but I think at the higher
*26:22.880- 26:28.360* :  levels when you're going to get a player off the field for up to 10 minutes that might change
*26:28.360- 26:33.820* :  behaviors. So that's what it's for it's saying you're mounting off to the referee off you go and calm
*26:33.820- 26:42.620* :  down. Yes and if we can use the synbin as a deterrent for behaviour so they just calm down you know
*26:42.620- 26:49.680* :  just let the steam the air settle then I think that's a really good idea. Now I have to say that
*26:49.720- 26:55.820* :  I rarely am lost for words when I hear a bit of news but when I was heard that VR might be extended
*26:56.820- 27:01.180* :  I couldn't believe it to tell me this to referees think this is working.
*27:02.580- 27:07.980* :  Well I think this is now becoming ridiculous. The big issue with behaviour on the field now
*27:07.980- 27:14.780* :  is mainly because of the VR decisions that are given or not given. So like most things you need
*27:14.780- 27:22.440* :  to really drill down to the root of the issue and that is let's get VR right. So clubs and managers
*27:22.440- 27:27.660* :  and players kept saying they want the big decisions to be correct. Well this is what you've got.
*27:27.660- 27:32.900* :  You've got four and five minute stopgages for VR to make a decision before you can celebrate a goal
*27:32.900- 27:36.960* :  or not. Isn't the problem that you've taken a subjective decision and you've just made it
*27:36.960- 27:41.960* :  subjective with more people involved taking longer and in the end you look at the replay and say
*27:41.960- 27:45.700* :  what you could call it there's what you could call it that way but you've just ruined the atmosphere
*27:45.700- 27:52.180* :  at any football match. Totally ruined it. It's sanitising it. It's taking the passion out of the game.
*27:52.540- 27:59.180* :  I think VR has a really positive place in the game but take it back to what it was more in four.
*27:59.880- 28:06.160* :  It was to help referees make the decisions on the clear and obvious that they have missed.
*28:07.280- 28:12.320* :  Now if we start to sanitise it we throw in and goal kicks and corner kicks. You just as well
*28:12.320- 28:19.500* :  not have a referee on the field. Just rely upon VR completely. I believe VR can be a use for
*28:19.500- 28:24.660* :  tall but now they're using it as a weapon and that is boiling out game. But couldn't they just
*28:24.660- 28:29.660* :  limit it in the way? So in tennis it is four things that are objective either cross the line or
*28:29.660- 28:34.560* :  didn't cross the line. I like to do with goal mouth and not for those objectives was that really
*28:34.560- 28:40.420* :  and ball. Yeah and I think this is the problem. Why would assistant referees or referees make
*28:40.420- 28:44.900* :  decisions? Why would they when they know the AR are going to make them? I've come to the conclusion.
*28:44.900- 28:50.420* :  I don't have an idea anymore what a penalty is and what it isn't. You don't have come to the
*28:50.420- 28:58.860* :  conclusion. I know and I clearly don't. Former football referee Janie Frampton. In many
*28:58.860- 29:04.780* :  parliaments members are expected to adhere to certain standards. A case in point being the US Senate
*29:04.780- 29:10.360* :  which recently passed a resolution formalising business attire as the proper dress code after
*29:10.360- 29:15.900* :  a democratic member John Fetterman turned up for work in shorts and a hoodie. Well in Kenya the
*29:15.900- 29:21.480* :  speaker of parliament Moses Wattangula has ruled that the Kondasuit named after the former president
*29:21.480- 29:27.480* :  of Zambia is not acceptable attire. Our Africa regional editor Will Ross explains why.
*29:28.280- 29:33.220* :  Well first of all let's focus on the Kondasuit and what it looks like. So close your eyes and
*29:33.220- 29:37.600* :  jump in the wardrobe or maybe for health and safety reasons you better jump in the wardrobe first
*29:37.600- 29:43.580* :  and then close your eyes. Now imagine a jacket shorts leave with lapels or even one that's got a
*29:43.580- 29:49.500* :  short upturned narrow style collar. Well the problem for Kenya MPs is these suits are worn without a
*29:49.500- 29:55.180* :  shirt and tie and as the speaker Moses Wattangula pointed out rule number nine of Kenya's parliamentary
*29:55.180- 30:01.240* :  dress code says when in the chamber male MPs have to wear a tie as well as a shirt and jacket of
*30:01.240- 30:06.080* :  course. It's not the first time the rule book has been brought out. 20 years ago the opposition
*30:06.080- 30:12.060* :  politician Raila Rodingo walked in wearing a flowing Nigerian robe known as an Agbada. He had to
*30:12.060- 30:16.640* :  learn that unlike primary school children across the world who are treated to an occasional wear
*30:16.640- 30:21.880* :  what you like day, Kenya MPs have to stick to the jacket and tie uniform every day.
*30:22.420- 30:26.720* :  Decades ago it looked as though Tanzania's independence leader Julius Niereri and of course
*30:26.720- 30:31.740* :  Zambia's Kenneth Cowanda wore these suits with a sense of pride. They seem to be celebrating
*30:31.740- 30:37.000* :  cutting the link with tie obsessed Britain. Perhaps not surprising then that some Kenyans have
*30:37.000- 30:42.540* :  criticized this strict dress code one describing it as a hangover of a colonial mentality.
*30:43.680- 30:46.400* :  The always impeccably dressed will rust there.
*30:48.940- 30:53.000* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
