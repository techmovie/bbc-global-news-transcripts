*00:16.860- 00:21.180* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zing Sing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*00:21.440- 00:25.260* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*00:25.260- 00:32.120* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*00:32.120- 00:37.460* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*00:37.460- 00:43.640* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner, but controversially turned against the players
*00:44.160- 00:48.160* :  when Cisnik as well. So is he good, bad or just another billionaire?
*00:48.420- 00:51.840* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*00:57.560- 01:00.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:02.960- 01:08.600* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday 15th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:09.220- 01:14.780* :  Israeli forces have been going from room to room interrogating people in a raid on Gaza's main
*01:14.780- 01:20.900* :  hospital, which Hamas denies using as a command centre. Britain's Supreme Court has ruled that the
*01:20.900- 01:25.160* :  government's flagship policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful.
*01:27.640- 01:33.120* :  Also in this podcast, a major study has found that global warming is already causing severe
*01:33.120- 01:38.960* :  damage to human's health. And it eats its own feathers and then it vomits. The New Zealand bird
*01:39.180- 01:41.060* :  and the talk show host who loves it.
*01:55.640- 02:01.220* :  We begin in the Gaza Strip, where more than 100 Israeli soldiers have stormed the largest
*02:01.220- 02:06.920* :  hospital supported by tanks in its grounds. The army says five Hamas gunmen were killed in a
*02:06.920- 02:12.220* :  firefight outside the Al-Shifa hospital, and soldiers fought off what it called terrorist
*02:12.220- 02:17.940* :  squads on entering the complex. Israeli forces are said to be searching the hospital and interrogating
*02:17.940- 02:23.940* :  patients, staff, and some of those seeking shelter inside. Israel says Hamas has military
*02:23.940- 02:29.780* :  centres underneath the compound. Ray Admiral Daniel Hagari is a spokesman for the Israel Defense Force.
*02:29.780- 02:34.320* :  Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity,
*02:35.060- 02:43.200* :  IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area
*02:43.780- 02:49.460* :  in the Shifa hospital. Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the civilians in Gaza.
*02:49.740- 02:56.660* :  The IDF forces include medical teams and Arabic speakers who have undergone specified training
*02:56.660- 03:05.020* :  to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment, with the intent that no harm is caused
*03:05.560- 03:08.800* :  to the civilians being used by Hamas as human shields.
*03:09.540- 03:15.600* :  Well, men aged between 60 and 40 excluding medical staff have been told to leave the building.
*03:16.220- 03:20.900* :  There are thought to be thousands of people, medics, patients, babies, and displaced civilians
*03:20.900- 03:26.820* :  within the hospital complex. Martin Griffiths is the UN's under-secretary general for humanitarian
*03:26.820- 03:33.380* :  affairs. I understand their motive for seeking to get at Hamas wherever Hamas may be,
*03:33.960- 03:40.120* :  but it doesn't do a thing to alter the very well-established protection that hospitals,
*03:40.820- 03:44.800* :  schools, and other such institutions have under-international humanitarian law,
*03:45.260- 03:48.780* :  not to be places of attack, but to be places of safety.
*03:49.280- 03:53.840* :  And the Ashifa is no different from anywhere else in the world in that respect.
*03:54.360- 03:57.440* :  So that's the view of the UN and before that, Israel's government.
*03:57.440- 04:02.880* :  Well, the BBC's Rusty Abu Al-Aluf is on the ground in Khan Yunus in the south of Gaza.
*04:02.880- 04:06.020* :  He's spoken to a contact inside the Ashifa hospital.
*04:32.540- 04:39.000* :  Facility in Gaza, Shifa hospital, he said, been later on they were calling people by
*04:39.000- 04:45.060* :  allowed the speaker. People aged 16 to 40 only the men to go out of the building except the
*04:45.060- 04:51.760* :  emergency department and the surgical department. And to be gathered in the courtyard of the hospital,
*04:52.420- 04:58.160* :  they bought a dictator like a scanning machine and everybody has to go through the scanning
*04:58.160- 05:03.480* :  machine before going into the space area. And he said soldiers were inside the hospital
*05:03.480- 05:09.500* :  sashing from room to room and interrogating the patient and the medical stuff inside the hospital.
*05:09.500- 05:15.540* :  He heard for about 10 minutes gunfire and he believed it was like they were shooting on air
*05:15.780- 05:20.200* :  just to force those remain inside to go out for interrogation.
*05:20.720- 05:26.720* :  Thanks for surrounding the hospital from all around the area and the whole facility is under
*05:26.720- 05:32.780* :  Israeli control. Do you know if people you spoken to or the Israeli authorities are giving
*05:32.780- 05:39.700* :  any more detail about specifically why Al-Shifa has been targeted in those claims that it is in
*05:39.700- 05:45.580* :  some sense a cover for a Hamas base? Yes, I think the Israelis were very clear from the beginning
*05:45.580- 05:51.200* :  saying that Hamas is using the Al-Shifa hospital as a command center for military purposes.
*05:51.200- 05:55.880* :  Hamas, the militants group who also run the local authority here including the health
*05:55.880- 06:01.540* :  ministries denied this and they said we're ready for any inspectors to come and inspect the hospital
*06:01.540- 06:08.120* :  international inquiry. They deny any military involvement inside the hospital and the issue
*06:08.120- 06:13.220* :  just a statement about an hour ago saying that definitely nobody was shooting or using any of
*06:13.220- 06:18.900* :  the hospital properties for any military purposes. So now the whole hospital is in control of
*06:18.900- 06:24.560* :  the Israelis and they are inside searching and investigating and we are waiting to hear more
*06:24.560- 06:30.200* :  from the Israelis about discrimination. Rishdi Abu al-Aluf who continues to report for us from
*06:30.200- 06:34.600* :  the south of Gaza. What we've also heard from the BBC's Al-Agarin who's been speaking to a
*06:34.600- 06:42.780* :  doctor from Al-Shifa hospital. We managed to contact a plastic surgeon Dr. Ahmad Malalakati and
*06:42.780- 06:49.480* :  he really poured out his heart in the conversation. His fears, his frustration, his concern for his
*06:49.480- 06:54.460* :  patients. He said that last night there had been a lot of bombing and shooting around the hospital.
*06:54.460- 07:01.220* :  He said in fact that there had been a direct strike on the fifth floor by Israel and that a whole
*07:01.220- 07:06.620* :  had been punched in the floor. He said that he and colleagues were sheltering on the floor below.
*07:06.620- 07:12.160* :  He said they were trying to console each other. They felt that these might be the last moments of
*07:12.160- 07:18.300* :  their lives and he said the impact on the floor above was into a room where patients were located
*07:18.380- 07:25.200* :  but he said that no one was actually hurt. Now he described a situation full of fear for staff,
*07:25.200- 07:31.200* :  for patients and for many people sheltering inside the hospital with Israeli troops now moving
*07:31.200- 07:36.840* :  around. He gave us some numbers. He said he thought there were about 700 patients, the same number
*07:36.840- 07:43.040* :  of staff and about 2,000 others who were still sheltering and he said it was impossible in recent days
*07:43.040- 07:49.360* :  for anyone to try to leave because anyone who did came under fire from Israeli forces and were
*07:49.360- 07:56.760* :  wounded or were killed by Israeli tanks or Israeli snipers and this despite Israel's statement
*07:56.760- 08:02.180* :  that there would be a safe corridor for evacuations. I asked him about this issue of the claims by
*08:02.180- 08:07.420* :  Israel and now by the United States that Hamas is operating from underneath the hospital.
*08:07.420- 08:13.660* :  He was adamant that he had never seen a single gun or a single Hamas member inside the hospital.
*08:13.660- 08:20.020* :  He said there were tunnels under all of Gaza. He described it as an underground city but he said
*08:20.020- 08:26.340* :  he had never seen anybody emerge from a tunnel into the hospital. He insisted it was an entirely
*08:26.340- 08:31.980* :  civilian facility and that people are now trapped there and he asked when is help going to come.
*08:32.620- 08:38.120* :  Allagheran ending are reporting there from Israel and Gaza. Now dealing with increasing migration
*08:38.120- 08:44.260* :  and asylum seekers is a critical issue for some European governments. Here in the UK the government
*08:44.260- 08:49.500* :  has suffered a major setback in the way it wants to deal with asylum seekers. This Supreme Court
*08:49.500- 08:54.800* :  here in London has ruled as unlawful the policy of sending some migrants to a third country,
*08:54.800- 09:00.500* :  Rwanda, while their applications are processed. The human rights lawyer Jeffrey Robertson welcomed
*09:00.500- 09:06.740* :  the ruling. It's a great vindication of the rule of law and indeed the rule of British law
*09:07.220- 09:16.160* :  even though we may express it in French reformment is a French word. It's perhaps British people can
*09:16.700- 09:24.640* :  pronounce it re-thoulement because it is foul. It's sending people to escape from death and torture
*09:25.160- 09:31.020* :  back to the country where they'd be killed and tortured. Jeffrey Robertson there who for the record
*09:31.020- 09:36.520* :  once served as a minister in government under the current Labour opposition. Well our political
*09:36.520- 09:42.040* :  correspondent Rob Watson told me what this all means. The Rwanda policy was the idea that people who
*09:42.040- 09:48.780* :  had arrived in in Bretonon boats that they would be sent to Rwanda where they would make asylum
*09:48.780- 09:54.120* :  claims there. In other words say look we are legitimately refugees so that's the sort of
*09:54.140- 09:59.560* :  nub of it and interestingly what the court has sort of said is not that the sort of principle
*09:59.560- 10:06.060* :  of outsourcing asylum claims to third countries is illegal but they've sort of said that Rwanda
*10:06.060- 10:10.180* :  in particular has a problem because he couldn't really be sure that they had the sort of resources
*10:10.800- 10:16.000* :  or the sort of set up to do it properly. So I mean it's a significant knock isn't it for the
*10:16.000- 10:21.640* :  ruling Conservative Party and the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. This is one of his key five pledges
*10:21.640- 10:24.580* :  is it in a year ahead when there's probably going to be a general election here.
*10:24.740- 10:28.980* :  Yeah absolutely Robyn I mean at the start of this year he said one of the things he was going
*10:28.980- 10:33.720* :  to do is to stop the boats and now clearly that is in tatters in the sense that it's
*10:34.040- 10:38.900* :  clearly not going to be any deportations before the end of the year and really why this matters
*10:39.460- 10:44.740* :  is that opinion polling suggests that for people who vote Conservative in 2019 people who voted
*10:44.740- 10:49.600* :  Brexit in 2016 this is something they feel really really passionately about but I mean interestingly
*10:49.600- 10:54.900* :  Robyn it's not as if Mr Sunak is saying all right hands up this is all gone horribly wrong
*10:54.900- 10:59.380* :  he's sort of doubling down saying look what we're going to do is we're going to try and improve
*10:59.380- 11:05.580* :  Rwanda's capacity to process asylum seekers but he's also sort of threatened if you like to press the
*11:05.880- 11:09.680* :  the sort of nuclear button that's to say well you know I've Britain absolutely had to ignore
*11:10.200- 11:14.380* :  united nations and European court conventions well maybe it would.
*11:14.760- 11:19.200* :  All right so I mean he's been speaking in the last hour or so in the House of Commons
*11:19.700- 11:25.320* :  in Parliament how significant is this policy for him as a leader and for his party and in terms
*11:25.320- 11:31.820* :  of their legitimacy their credibility well it's hugely significant because he did make this a pledge
*11:31.820- 11:38.400* :  he was incredibly bold about it as it turns out it seems rather unwise to be so bold and it's
*11:38.400- 11:43.360* :  something that many Conservatives MPs feel immensely passionately about particularly those on
*11:43.360- 11:48.920* :  the right of the party and now clearly they are set to disappoint their voters at least in the
*11:48.920- 11:53.800* :  short term. And just quickly we've touched on this before it's also being watched by others in
*11:53.800- 11:59.080* :  other European capitals isn't it? It is because Britain is not the only country to think about
*11:59.120- 12:03.580* :  outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to third countries and this you know this doesn't
*12:03.580- 12:07.940* :  mean that that can't be done it just means that any country who was thinking about doing it
*12:08.360- 12:13.020* :  would need to make sure that they picked a country that their courts would think was safe and in
*12:13.020- 12:18.000* :  this case the British courts has decided that Rwanda isn't safe on the basis of UN evidence.
*12:18.660- 12:24.360* :  Rob Watson reporting. Two men who are arguably the most powerful leaders in the world will meet
*12:24.360- 12:29.740* :  face to face in a few hours time. President Biden and China's Xi Jinping will have talks in
*12:29.740- 12:35.380* :  California it's only the second time they've met in their current jobs. A lot has changed in
*12:35.380- 12:40.440* :  particular for Mr. Xi since the last sit down. This meeting on the edge of a summit of Asia
*12:40.440- 12:45.480* :  Pacific leaders in San Francisco is aimed at easing tensions over trade and technology
*12:46.220- 12:50.560* :  restrictions and US support for Taiwan. From California here's Gary O'Donohy.
*12:52.680- 12:57.540* :  In the gray overcast skies above me here in San Francisco there's a plane circling.
*12:58.120- 13:04.720* :  It's trailing a banner it says end CCP the Chinese Communist Party and free the Uyghurs.
*13:05.160- 13:11.780* :  It is by no means an exhaustive list of the issues that have played US-China relations for years.
*13:12.740- 13:18.880* :  This meeting and hopefully put a floor to the downward spiral of China-US relations.
*13:19.400- 13:26.800* :  Both presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden clearly want to stabilize the relationship.
*13:27.340- 13:32.820* :  Two views from Beijing and Washington. The first from Wang Guang a journalist and academic.
*13:32.820- 13:37.120* :  The second from Danny Russell a former assistant secretary of state.
*13:37.780- 13:43.800* :  Obviously we have radically different systems and technology also has been a driver because
*13:44.560- 13:52.080* :  the race to gain the upper hand in critical emerging technologies directly connects not only
*13:52.080- 13:59.420* :  to economic power but to military power. For Wang Guang America needs to stay out of Chinese
*13:59.420- 14:05.900* :  internal affairs. President Xi has good intentions towards the United States.
*14:06.180- 14:12.520* :  I think it will be fair to say that he's disillusioned over the years by the fact that
*14:12.520- 14:21.320* :  number one America is set on containing and beating up this an ear pier and the Liberals in America
*14:21.320- 14:29.660* :  he found have this obsession with issues such as US democracy, human rights and would tend to impose
*14:29.660- 14:32.480* :  their own values and only theology of other peoples.
*14:34.760- 14:40.480* :  Taiwan 130 kilometers off the Chinese coast regularly holds air aid drills.
*14:41.300- 14:45.080* :  China claims the island of 23 million people as its own territory.
*14:45.080- 14:52.160* :  The US doesn't support Taiwanese independence but does oppose any attempt by Beijing to take over.
*14:52.160- 14:59.040* :  It's led to escalating tensions in the region with hundreds of close naval and air encounters.
*14:59.500- 15:03.180* :  We don't want anything to happen to Taiwan by force.
*15:03.540- 15:09.480* :  The situation worsened last year when Nancy Pelosi, the then democratic speaker of the US House of
*15:09.480- 15:16.340* :  Representatives, went to Taiwan angering China. Military to military communications was severed
*15:16.680- 15:22.260* :  and restoring those is a key aim of this summit. We're following the details about that Chinese
*15:22.260- 15:28.640* :  spy balloon traveling across the country. The communications crisis worsened in February when
*15:28.640- 15:34.280* :  an alleged Chinese spy balloon was shot down by the Americans as it crossed the United States.
*15:34.300- 15:39.620* :  Former US ambassador to China Max Borkers says it was a particular low point.
*15:39.620- 15:45.020* :  It passed over our house matter of fact here in Montana. It was serious because it's visual.
*15:45.300- 15:50.280* :  The visual is a balloon which is all kinds of fanciful emotions. Let's make sure they're
*15:50.280- 15:56.120* :  supposed to impact the number of balloons. That the two leaders of agreed to meet here in San Francisco
*15:56.640- 16:02.540* :  is a success in itself but few believe this meeting will herald some new dawn in cordial
*16:02.540- 16:09.820* :  relations between two powers whose interests differ so widely. An North America correspondence
*16:09.820- 16:17.260* :  Gary O'Donohy reported. Still to come on the global news podcast, the BBC finds evidence of an
*16:17.260- 16:22.840* :  illegal market in unofficial weight loss trucks. Even if you go over by one two milligrams,
*16:23.460- 16:28.660* :  that can cause severe side effects, diarrhea, vomiting. It can potentially be life threatening.
*16:38.120- 16:42.460* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zingsing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*16:42.720- 16:46.540* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*16:46.900- 16:52.320* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost a hundred million dollars
*16:52.320- 16:57.200* :  playing basketball. But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan
*16:57.200- 17:03.600* :  range is worth billions. And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But controversially
*17:03.600- 17:09.420* :  turned against the players once his sneakers were off. So is he good bad or just another billionaire?
*17:09.680- 17:13.120* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*17:20.560- 17:25.700* :  Welcome back. And as world leaders prepare for the annual cop meeting on climate change later
*17:25.700- 17:30.580* :  this month is being held in Dubai, there are fresh warnings that man-made global warming
*17:30.580- 17:36.480* :  is making more people across the world sick and causing more deaths from extreme heat and drought.
*17:37.080- 17:40.600* :  Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazunda, has been looking at the new report
*17:40.600- 17:46.380* :  in the medical journal The Lancet. So this is a huge report. This was 114 scientists from
*17:46.380- 17:50.760* :  around the world, including experts from the World Health Organization, the World Meteorological
*17:51.700- 17:56.640* :  Organization and 50 odd other institutions. It's a big piece of work with lots of data in there.
*17:57.900- 18:02.280* :  Some of the headlines, they're calling this a stock take of kind of where the world is
*18:02.560- 18:07.820* :  in terms of climate and health. And they suggest that by looking at the most recent 10-year global
*18:07.860- 18:13.540* :  average of how much our planet has been warming. So that's about 1.14 degrees Celsius.
*18:14.220- 18:22.400* :  They found that heat related deaths in people over 65 increased by 85 percent between 2013 and
*18:22.400- 18:28.100* :  22 compared to the late 90s. Now they say that's more than twice the increase that would have
*18:28.100- 18:31.880* :  been expected if the climate hadn't changed. So if you take other things into account like
*18:32.160- 18:37.340* :  aging population, things like that, we know that the very old and the very young are in particular
*18:37.340- 18:44.260* :  risk of of heat stress for older people. For example, high temperatures can exacerbate things
*18:44.300- 18:48.720* :  and that they already have like heart conditions or if they're already at higher risk of having
*18:48.720- 18:54.120* :  a stroke. And that's a real worry because the report also says we were on average across the
*18:54.120- 18:59.680* :  globe exposed to more than two and a half months of health threatening high temperatures
*19:00.120- 19:06.220* :  each year between 2018 and 2022. And they said more than half of those days were made more likely
*19:06.220- 19:13.660* :  because of climate change caused by humans and just one last one. They're finding that increasingly
*19:13.660- 19:20.320* :  frequent heat waves and droughts were responsible for 127 million more people experiencing
*19:20.320- 19:29.460* :  food insecurity in more than 120 countries in 2021 than in the 90s and early 2000s. So lots of
*19:29.460- 19:33.500* :  change and lots of concern here. I was going to say just briefly that combination of extreme
*19:33.500- 19:38.360* :  heat but also more drought, which you've alluded to there is particularly threatening for those
*19:38.360- 19:42.680* :  in less well off countries. Exactly and that's another thing they really point to in this report.
*19:42.740- 19:47.940* :  And it's been said many times before that the people who are least responsible for climate change
*19:47.940- 19:54.180* :  are going to be the ones that are most impacted and they are poorer countries that already have
*19:54.180- 20:01.520* :  food security issues. So this is a particular concern for them as well. But there is hope in all
*20:01.520- 20:05.740* :  of this we're being told that they were quite mindful that you know it's not just all doom and
*20:05.740- 20:10.120* :  glue. They say that there does need to be a significant acceleration in the world's transition
*20:10.120- 20:16.640* :  away from what they call health harming fossil fuels. They also had some very strong condemnation
*20:16.640- 20:21.260* :  for governments and companies and banks for continuing to invest in oil and gas. But they said
*20:21.540- 20:27.120* :  there's lots of opportunity here because by cutting fossil fuels and really getting on with that
*20:27.120- 20:33.420* :  now happening much quicker than it's happening so far you make human health better more generally
*20:33.420- 20:38.020* :  because you know diets become better you have more access to to safer drinking water.
*20:38.500- 20:44.340* :  Chulip Mazunda reporting. Now let's go to Haiti where one of the most powerful gang leaders has been
*20:44.340- 20:49.940* :  killed prompting fears of a new turf war between groups fighting for control of his territory.
*20:50.400- 20:56.480* :  Iska Andris was one of the three leaders in control of Site Solay the biggest slum in the capital
*20:56.480- 21:02.440* :  Porto Prince. Reports from Haiti say his gang was responsible for blocking the country's main fuel
*21:02.440- 21:08.300* :  terminal for many weeks last year which caused fuel shortage years power cuts and rioting.
*21:08.680- 21:15.420* :  So who was Iska Andris? Well my colleague Victoria Oancuna found out more from Harold Isaac who
*21:15.420- 21:22.000* :  is a journalist in Porto Prince. Iska Andris is one of the founders of the G9 gang alliance
*21:22.000- 21:30.260* :  where he lives in Site Solay has been known as a difficult neighborhood for years on end and
*21:31.380- 21:36.720* :  such it's not surprising that some folks in the area decide to take the matter in their own hands
*21:36.720- 21:43.660* :  and develop criminal enterprises at the same time. So how did he rise to power to become a gang leader
*21:43.660- 21:49.460* :  from being a simple math teacher? If you look at his history it's not necessarily any different
*21:49.460- 21:57.380* :  from other folks that have especially gang notorious gang leaders such as Barbecue who is
*21:57.380- 22:03.840* :  internationally renowned but Iska is known to be one of the veterans of these criminal
*22:03.840- 22:09.300* :  enterprises in this area. He has been known for years and he's been known to be ruthless.
*22:09.960- 22:15.040* :  The gang dynamic in Haiti always has has been known to have a political component to it
*22:15.600- 22:22.500* :  and even today many of the gang leaders take political stand against either against or for
*22:22.500- 22:29.060* :  government. So it's not necessarily completely out of character that you would have someone
*22:29.060- 22:35.040* :  that would switch its is or her trade to get involved in being a criminal.
*22:35.560- 22:42.780* :  So what do we know so far then about Iska Andre's death? At this stage it still remains unclear
*22:42.780- 22:50.220* :  the details of how he died. There are rumors stating that he may have been poisoned and as
*22:50.500- 22:58.260* :  as a result decided to take his own life but that being said it none of these details have been
*22:58.260- 23:06.640* :  confirmed. What we know at this stage is that he died and that as a result a turf war has
*23:07.340- 23:15.780* :  reignited in the area with you know rival gangs trying to take over Billy Cooke which is the
*23:15.780- 23:21.300* :  area that he used to control. What are some of the things that Mr. Andres has been alleged to have
*23:21.300- 23:27.180* :  been involved in when he was at the top of his game as a gang leader? As part of the
*23:28.180- 23:35.700* :  G9 gang alliance which is one of the founders Iska was involved in racketeering of merchandise
*23:35.700- 23:42.800* :  trucks involving theft involved in demanding businesses to pay for security. It's very
*23:42.800- 23:49.220* :  populist nearly 300,000 people are living day by day in that area in very difficult conditions
*23:49.220- 23:57.580* :  and that renewed fresh bout of violence that ensued after his death is creating serious challenges
*23:57.580- 24:05.140* :  for humanitarian interventions in this area. And that was Harold Isaac speaking to us from Porto
*24:05.140- 24:11.160* :  Prince. Now the BBC has found evidence of a secret market in unlicensed versions of the so-called
*24:11.160- 24:17.840* :  skinny jab in beauty salons in the UK. The official new weight loss drug is sold as ozempic or
*24:17.840- 24:23.180* :  wigovy and it's only available on prescription from a doctor it's supposed to be taken as well
*24:23.180- 24:28.340* :  under medical supervision. But the BBC's prior rye has been investigating people selling cheap
*24:28.340- 24:36.380* :  unlicensed versions of the medication with dangerous side effects. I'm just here to pick up some
*24:36.380- 24:44.080* :  semi-glutide that I would eat this week. It's a saturday morning and I've just been sold a
*24:44.080- 24:50.440* :  knockoff version of a prescription weight loss drug at a beauty salon despite not seeing a doctor.
*24:50.680- 24:56.300* :  semi-glutide is the active ingredient in the two prescription drugs ozempic and wigovy.
*24:56.620- 25:03.200* :  Ozempic was originally made to treat diabetes but because its side effects include a loss of
*25:03.200- 25:09.400* :  appetite and lots of celebrities were rumoured to take it it started a craze for these so-called
*25:09.400- 25:15.960* :  skinny jabs. A black market popped up in the UK with British sellers on social media selling a
*25:15.960- 25:26.200* :  knockoff product with videos like these but now a BBC investigation reveals that a black market
*25:26.200- 25:35.100* :  is also operating in beauty salons in Liverpool and Manchester. I secretly record it in four
*25:35.100- 25:41.280* :  salons and heard dangerous advice being given on how to take the drug. The salon workers voices
*25:41.720- 25:46.860* :  have been distorted. You start with a small dose. I started with 10 and now after five weeks and
*25:46.860- 25:52.560* :  more to 16 units. You just do it yourself you think well I've been a little bit started to feel
*25:52.560- 25:55.700* :  a little bit more hungry so because you want to just get used to the thing you're just increasing
*25:55.700- 26:02.160* :  your dose slightly. So you're just like listening to your body almost? Is it possible to have
*26:02.160- 26:06.220* :  like too much? Well if you have too much you just won't want to eat anything and you might feel sick.
*26:06.460- 26:13.400* :  I can't believe you're day energy. Nova Nordisk, a Danish company who makes the real drug says there
*26:13.400- 26:19.420* :  is no approved generic or cheap version. The official drug called wigovy is designed for people
*26:19.420- 26:25.900* :  living with obesity or who have weight-related health conditions. Official versions are taken under
*26:25.900- 26:32.320* :  expert medical guidance. This is not what I saw. The salons I visited. Although some asked if I had
*26:32.320- 26:38.100* :  any health conditions all were happy to sell me semi-glutide despite me being a healthy weight.
*26:38.640- 26:43.460* :  Although we could only visit a small number we found other examples of salons across the UK
*26:43.460- 26:50.800* :  advertising knockoff versions of the drug. We lab tested 12 samples 11 bought from social media
*26:50.800- 26:57.640* :  and one from a salon and found that while most of them contained the active ingredient a quarter
*26:57.640- 27:03.280* :  contained little or none of the drug. 12 products have been bought from a manufacturing chain
*27:03.280- 27:09.060* :  that isn't regulated. Here's what Dr Alex Lawson, a consultant clinical scientist at University
*27:09.060- 27:14.780* :  Hospital Birmingham Pat to say. So other products may be less pure, may contain things that are
*27:14.780- 27:19.220* :  more dangerous and potentially the next time people buy from these manufacturers who's to say that
*27:19.220- 27:23.660* :  that manufacturing process hasn't changed. The truth is you don't know what you're getting and
*27:23.660- 27:29.200* :  even if you did get a real drug under these conditions the healthcare professionals I spoke to
*27:29.200- 27:35.480* :  issued strong warnings about injecting so-called skinny jabs without proper medical oversight.
*27:35.480- 27:40.980* :  Dr Idris Mughal is an NHS doctor who runs a popular tick-tock account combating medical
*27:41.860- 27:46.720* :  misinformation. Even if you go over by one two milligrams that can cause severe side effects,
*27:46.720- 27:54.540* :  nausea, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, vomiting and if it's not done in a properly sterile
*27:54.540- 27:59.200* :  environment it can potentially be life-threatening. So if any of these sellers broken the law,
*27:59.200- 28:04.320* :  well it's such a new area that the group who regulate medicines in the UK have said they decide
*28:04.320- 28:10.280* :  on a case-by-case basis based on how it is being sold and the claims they make about the products.
*28:11.180- 28:17.440* :  Priorai. Now we're going to end on two unusual worlds colliding birds and US talk show hosts.
*28:17.440- 28:22.680* :  And just to add to the confusion it's happening in New Zealand. A competition in the country to find
*28:22.680- 28:28.120* :  its bird of the century has ended with a winner that vomits and it grunts. It's called the Puteki
*28:28.120- 28:33.840* :  Teki. But it's been slightly controversial because the talk show host John Oliver who is not a
*28:33.840- 28:39.900* :  New Zealander exposed a loophole in the rules to mount a high profile campaign for the eventual winner.
*28:40.280- 28:47.200* :  I just want the Puteki Teki to win. I wanted to win in the biggest landslide in the history of
*28:47.200- 28:52.160* :  this magnificent competition. I wanted to do to other bird of the century candidates
*28:52.720- 28:57.020* :  what the Puteki Teki does to fish in New Zealand's lakes that is eat them alive and then
*28:57.020- 29:01.040* :  throw them pack up in a ball of feathers. Well I'm going to tell you in a minute how you can see
*29:01.040- 29:06.060* :  some pictures of the Puteki Teki. But why all the fuss about this puking grunting bird
*29:06.060- 29:11.240* :  or Nikola Toki is the chief executive of Forest and Bird New Zealand's leading independent
*29:11.240- 29:14.980* :  conservation organisation. And she's been speaking to my colleague Nick Robinson.
*29:15.600- 29:23.180* :  Forest and Bird for the last 18 years has run a bird of the year competition generally invite
*29:23.180- 29:28.500* :  some controversy and often even makes international headlines. But only a ripple
*29:28.500- 29:32.680* :  compete with the tighter wave that we are seeing. Indeed but the controversy is partly because
*29:32.680- 29:38.200* :  of what it looks like is that it's been described as a weird puking creature with a colorful mullet.
*29:38.720- 29:46.560* :  Yes and we embrace the mullet in New Zealand so I think maybe people were that we're trying to
*29:46.560- 29:52.380* :  channel their inner New Zealander and vote for the mullet but yes it has been somewhat of a
*29:52.380- 29:56.880* :  surprise to us in Forest and Bird. It's fair to say myself and my team haven't had an awful
*29:56.880- 30:00.700* :  lot of sleep over the last few days but we're okay about that we're doing it for the birds.
*30:00.700- 30:07.300* :  It looks like I'm told like a great crested grieve here in the UK. Yes it is it is in fact the
*30:07.360- 30:13.940* :  Australasian crested grieve and and I have posited to my my counterparts over the ditch
*30:14.360- 30:19.060* :  over in Australia that it might be a way of international diplomacy between our two countries
*30:19.060- 30:24.120* :  which have a fairly healthy rivalry. I was rather hoping for the Kakariki Karaka only because it's
*30:24.120- 30:33.040* :  hold to say. Yes the Kakariki Karaka isn't picked out. I think that's the thing to learn about
*30:33.040- 30:38.660* :  New Zealanders two things if it's got four legs and fur didn't belong here so anything that
*30:38.660- 30:44.020* :  has four legs and fur in this country is genuinely wrecking havoc for our native birds and
*30:44.020- 30:49.280* :  secondly unfortunately we are the extinction capital of the world and that is largely because
*30:49.280- 30:54.060* :  of the streets to a native birds. Nikola Toki from Forest and Bird in New Zealand there and if you
*30:54.060- 30:58.880* :  want to see what the Puteki Teki looks like there's no video of it doing its special thing but you
*30:58.880- 31:06.800* :  can see at BBC News online. That's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global
*31:06.800- 31:12.980* :  news podcast later if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can of course

*31:38.200- 31:44.540* :  How do we navigate in space? Are humans naturally clean and tidy? What exactly is this
*31:44.540- 31:51.780* :  quantum computer? Crowd science is the podcast that takes your science questions and goes in search
*31:51.780- 31:57.540* :  of the answers. My question for crowd science is artistic brings difference. Stick with me because
*31:57.540- 32:01.920* :  there's been some really fascinating research into this. That's crowd science from the BBC World

*32:16.540- 32:21.780* :  finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first Atley billionaire. Considered the NBA's
*32:21.780- 32:27.260* :  greatest player of all time he earned almost a hundred million dollars playing basketball. But
*32:27.260- 32:32.340* :  that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*32:32.340- 32:38.520* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner but controversially turned against the players
*32:39.040- 32:43.840* :  once his sneakers were off. So is he good bad or just another billionaire? To find out,
