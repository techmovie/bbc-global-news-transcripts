*01:16.780- 01:20.960* :  I'm Robin Brands and I'm two o'clock GMT on Monday the 13th of November.
*01:20.960- 01:22.040* :  These are our main stories.
*01:22.620- 01:24.800* :  There are big changes at the top of the UK government.
*01:24.800- 01:26.840* :  A senior minister has been sacked.
*01:26.840- 01:30.160* :  This is the sound of a former prime minister who's been brought back.
*01:30.500- 01:30.760* :  Morning.
*01:31.180- 01:32.820* :  I got a new challenge to all of you.
*01:34.880- 01:36.280* :  Do you have confidence in the PM?
*01:36.920- 01:42.460* :  Hamas says newborn babies are among those who've died following power cuts at Garza's biggest hospital.
*01:43.060- 01:45.200* :  We'll assess what could be next in the wider conflict.
*01:48.380- 01:52.200* :  Also in this podcast, the BBC has seen figures that suggest energy companies
*01:52.200- 01:54.400* :  are ignoring climate change targets.
*01:55.060- 01:57.740* :  And everyone in Kenya is getting the day off to plant trees
*01:57.740- 01:59.820* :  in a major climate change initiative.
*02:00.160- 02:02.560* :  I am going to plant a tree, not just a tree,
*02:02.720- 02:05.300* :  but a fruit tree because I need to eat from it as well.
*02:09.300- 02:12.040* :  We begin with big changes at the top of the UK government.
*02:12.040- 02:16.060* :  The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has sacked one of his most senior ministers
*02:16.560- 02:18.880* :  and brought back someone who used to do his job.
*02:19.380- 02:21.820* :  So, well, a braverman has been ditched as home secretary,
*02:21.820- 02:23.600* :  that's Britain's interior minister.
*02:24.100- 02:27.480* :  After weeks of speculation about her future and controversial comments,
*02:27.480- 02:31.060* :  she made about the role of the police at pro-Palestinian marches.
*02:31.560- 02:35.420* :  She's being replaced by the man who was foreign secretary James Clevverley.
*02:35.900- 02:38.320* :  Now stepping into his shoes is David Cameron.
*02:38.320- 02:39.100* :  Remember him?
*02:39.620- 02:41.960* :  Well, Mr Cameron, now known as Lord Cameron,
*02:41.960- 02:45.100* :  was prime minister in the UK for six years, up to 2016.
*02:45.940- 02:47.940* :  He's not, though, a member of Parliament anymore,
*02:47.940- 02:51.700* :  so he's being given a seat in the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.
*02:52.380- 02:56.440* :  Well, this was the sound as a delighted looking Mr Cameron left down in street this morning
*02:56.880- 02:58.300* :  with his new job and his new title.
*03:11.520- 03:14.800* :  Well, you couldn't see it, but taken from me, that was a smiling David Cameron.
*03:14.960- 03:19.240* :  And this is the man replacing Suéla Brafaboune as the UK's interior minister, James Clevverley.
*03:19.660- 03:23.740* :  I intend to do this job in the way that I feel best,
*03:24.540- 03:27.180* :  protects the British people and our interests.
*03:27.880- 03:31.600* :  I have had a very good conversation with the prime minister,
*03:31.600- 03:36.660* :  who's made it very clear that he wants us to deliver on our promises,
*03:36.740- 03:39.700* :  to stop the boats, to protect the British people,
*03:39.700- 03:42.160* :  make sure everybody feels secure in their lives.
*03:42.680- 03:45.720* :  Well, the reshuffle, as it's known, comes as the governing conservatives
*03:45.720- 03:48.460* :  are languishing significantly in the opinion polls
*03:48.860- 03:52.280* :  with a general election due to be called in the UK by the end of next year.
*03:53.000- 03:55.380* :  So what does it mean for the stability of the British government
*03:55.380- 03:58.760* :  and will anything change in particular in foreign relations?
*03:59.500- 04:03.340* :  Our political correspondent, Rob Watson, first told us why Suéla Brafaboune has gone.
*04:03.960- 04:09.820* :  She's gone because Rishi Sunak considered her to be more of a liability than an asset.
*04:09.820- 04:14.440* :  I mean, in the past, it had been seen that perhaps some of the populist right-wing rhetoric
*04:14.440- 04:18.600* :  that she came out whether it was on immigration, stopping the small boats
*04:19.220- 04:21.520* :  or even on these recent pro-Palestine in March,
*04:21.520- 04:24.160* :  so that was all rather sort of useful, if you like,
*04:24.160- 04:26.020* :  to have someone saying that for the government.
*04:26.060- 04:27.800* :  But I think Mr. Sunak has decided.
*04:28.320- 04:32.280* :  She's that most unfortunate of things, Rob, and an unpopular populist.
*04:32.460- 04:34.640* :  Can you give us a quick reminder about David Cameron,
*04:34.640- 04:38.000* :  now known as Lord Cameron, who is back in the cabinet?
*04:38.560- 04:41.020* :  Yes, I mean, it is a quite extraordinary move.
*04:41.080- 04:44.520* :  I mean, they often say there aren't really any surprises in politics, Rob.
*04:44.520- 04:47.240* :  But this was to everybody by surprise.
*04:47.840- 04:50.420* :  So he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
*04:50.420- 04:55.160* :  He became Prime Minister of the coalition government in 2010 with the Liberal Democrats.
*04:55.660- 04:59.200* :  And of course, what it'll be remembered for is for calling the referendum
*04:59.200- 05:02.300* :  in 2016 on Britain's membership of the EU.
*05:02.300- 05:06.020* :  He desperately wanted Britain to stay in the European Union.
*05:06.020- 05:08.620* :  He lost, and so many, many people,
*05:09.080- 05:12.580* :  from all sides of the political spectrum, blame him for the sort of chaos
*05:12.580- 05:14.560* :  that is engulfed Britain ever since.
*05:14.680- 05:17.420* :  He's going to be the face of UK foreign relations now,
*05:17.420- 05:20.320* :  but it's not often the case in the UK's system
*05:20.320- 05:23.220* :  where a change of personal, a herald, a change of policy, does it?
*05:23.220- 05:25.320* :  But I mean, what's notable, you've mentioned Brexit there,
*05:25.840- 05:27.980* :  he was also very close to China, wasn't he,
*05:27.980- 05:30.680* :  and a real supporter of closer ties with China,
*05:30.680- 05:31.800* :  that's now very different now.
*05:31.820- 05:34.320* :  Is anything actually going to change in terms of UK foreign relations?
*05:34.660- 05:37.080* :  I think the short answer to your question is no.
*05:37.380- 05:40.080* :  I mean, lots of those on the right of the Conservative Party
*05:40.080- 05:43.100* :  who are very anti-China and very pro-Brexit
*05:43.100- 05:45.580* :  are already grumbling about having Mr Cameron back.
*05:45.940- 05:48.320* :  But I don't think it's going to change foreign policy
*05:48.320- 05:49.280* :  in any significant way.
*05:49.280- 05:52.620* :  I mean, what really changed Britain's foreign policy and perception
*05:52.820- 05:54.700* :  of its power and place of the world is Brexit,
*05:54.700- 05:58.200* :  which of course, many allies continue to consider a terrible,
*05:58.360- 05:59.740* :  a massive mistake.
*05:59.740- 06:01.960* :  But I think why it does change things?
*06:02.540- 06:05.380* :  And you'll forgive me for straying into domestic politics, Robyn,
*06:05.380- 06:08.320* :  is that this will likely be seen as an attempt
*06:08.320- 06:11.340* :  by Rishi Sunak to sort of shift the Conservative Party
*06:11.800- 06:13.900* :  from the right somewhat more to the centre,
*06:13.900- 06:17.180* :  which of course is going to be immensely controversial
*06:17.180- 06:20.120* :  with those in his party who likes well a braver man
*06:20.340- 06:23.580* :  and who want the party to be a sort of Brexit right-wing party.
*06:24.300- 06:26.560* :  Rob Watson on the reshuffle, and let's just explain,
*06:26.560- 06:28.660* :  so it's very clear how David Cameron
*06:28.980- 06:30.520* :  can come back to frontline politics.
*06:30.520- 06:32.260* :  He was Prime Minister until 2016,
*06:32.260- 06:33.720* :  then a member of Parliament.
*06:33.800- 06:37.100* :  He resigned, wasn't involved in frontline politics at all.
*06:37.520- 06:39.100* :  He's now coming back at the invitation
*06:39.100- 06:40.340* :  of the current Prime Minister,
*06:40.860- 06:42.820* :  but he's not in the House of Commons at its known.
*06:43.160- 06:44.660* :  Instead, he's going to the upper chamber,
*06:44.660- 06:48.100* :  the unelected House of Lords, which means, as part of the job,
*06:48.540- 06:51.280* :  he can be given a title and now known as Lord Cameron.
*06:51.400- 06:52.980* :  I hope that explains it in some way.
*06:53.780- 06:54.720* :  Okay, let's go to Gaza,
*06:54.940- 06:56.500* :  where the war between Israel and Hamas
*06:56.500- 06:57.720* :  is now in its sixth week.
*06:58.240- 06:59.920* :  And heavy fighting there is continuing.
*07:00.420- 07:02.440* :  Hamas, which governs Gaza and is regarded
*07:02.440- 07:05.460* :  as a terrorist organization by the US and UK governments,
*07:06.020- 07:08.300* :  says every hospital there is now out of service.
*07:09.020- 07:10.760* :  Battles have been raging very close
*07:10.840- 07:13.240* :  to the territory's largest hospital, Al-Shifa,
*07:13.660- 07:15.960* :  where more than 2,000 people are thought to be trapped.
*07:16.440- 07:17.700* :  Hamas says dozens of patients,
*07:17.700- 07:21.280* :  among them newborn babies, have died due to a lack of power.
*07:21.640- 07:24.800* :  Israel claims Hamas has built its headquarters under the building,
*07:25.280- 07:27.180* :  though doctors working there have denied this.
*07:27.300- 07:30.140* :  He's a correspondent in Gaza, Rusty Abolouf.
*07:30.740- 07:33.740* :  I made contact with a friend who is one of those
*07:33.920- 07:35.500* :  taking the hospital as shelter.
*07:35.500- 07:36.920* :  I mean, he told me all night,
*07:36.920- 07:37.680* :  there was bombing.
*07:37.680- 07:39.920* :  They damaged all the road around the hospital
*07:39.920- 07:42.080* :  and they kept only one road open,
*07:42.080- 07:44.300* :  which is the main gate of the hospital.
*07:44.300- 07:47.020* :  He said he saw many tanks around the hospital
*07:47.020- 07:48.200* :  and a lot of air strikes,
*07:48.200- 07:52.500* :  tin 11 air strikes within like meters of the hospital.
*07:52.500- 07:55.060* :  He said also one building or two buildings
*07:55.060- 07:58.160* :  were hit by air strike inside the hospital.
*07:58.160- 08:00.680* :  He said the situation remained very, very serious.
*08:00.680- 08:02.960* :  He said six o'clock in the morning,
*08:02.960- 08:06.020* :  very early in the morning, four people tried to escape
*08:06.620- 08:09.400* :  from the hospital and they will shoot in their legs
*08:09.840- 08:11.320* :  and they were bleeding for two hours
*08:11.320- 08:13.760* :  and then they have to rescue their lives
*08:13.760- 08:15.460* :  and drag them inside the hospital
*08:15.460- 08:16.880* :  for treatment, the situation,
*08:17.460- 08:21.720* :  very, very serious inside and around the hospital.
*08:21.720- 08:24.740* :  It's very hard for anybody who's visiting Shifa Hospital
*08:24.740- 08:26.940* :  to verify if there is anything underneath,
*08:26.980- 08:28.620* :  nobody would be allowed to see it.
*08:28.640- 08:31.420* :  And as a journalist, I have been to this hospital
*08:31.980- 08:32.520* :  hundreds of times.
*08:32.640- 08:34.480* :  I myself was born in this hospital
*08:34.480- 08:36.920* :  and my mother died in this hospital.
*08:36.920- 08:38.820* :  This is the main medical center
*08:39.360- 08:42.220* :  and the biggest one for the entire Gaza Strip
*08:42.220- 08:46.900* :  and it's like five, six, seven big buildings inside the place.
*08:47.040- 08:49.860* :  When we used to go, not only the journalists
*08:49.860- 08:52.840* :  by the International Red Cross in the WHO,
*08:52.900- 08:54.320* :  all of the organizations,
*08:54.380- 08:55.680* :  especially during the pandemic,
*08:56.060- 08:58.440* :  we used to visit this hospital quite a lot
*08:58.480- 09:00.880* :  to talk about the corona by the pandemic.
*09:01.220- 09:03.980* :  We haven't seen any military capability on the ground
*09:04.000- 09:06.300* :  or inside the facility.
*09:06.960- 09:08.560* :  I went to like two, three days ago,
*09:08.560- 09:11.440* :  there was about 10 cameras inside the hospital
*09:12.040- 09:13.860* :  making life, streaming life,
*09:13.860- 09:15.520* :  day and night from the hospital
*09:15.520- 09:17.520* :  and we haven't seen any military capability.
*09:17.520- 09:21.140* :  So it's very, very difficult to verify the Israeli claim
*09:21.140- 09:22.260* :  or the Hamas claim
*09:22.760- 09:26.400* :  and Hamas now is saying that we are ready to an investigation
*09:26.400- 09:28.940* :  if a third-party international community
*09:29.420- 09:32.720* :  would like to send an investigation committee to the hospital.
*09:33.240- 09:34.780* :  They said they are ready to deal with it
*09:34.820- 09:36.480* :  and open the hospital for them.
*09:36.660- 09:39.360* :  So it's really hard to verify the Israeli claim
*09:39.360- 09:40.700* :  or the Hamas claim on that
*09:40.700- 09:43.420* :  because as a journalist, I didn't see in my eye
*09:43.420- 09:45.660* :  any military capability inside the hospital.
*09:45.960- 09:48.300* :  Rusty Abu Alouf reporting from Gaza
*09:48.680- 09:50.300* :  outside the very hospital where he was born
*09:50.780- 09:51.680* :  in very different times.
*09:52.080- 09:53.620* :  Just before we recorded this podcast,
*09:53.620- 09:55.860* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Esther Ott
*09:55.860- 09:57.340* :  in Southern Israel, Mark Lohan.
*09:57.740- 10:00.660* :  Hospital sources are telling us that some of the babies
*10:01.000- 10:04.460* :  have already died, sadly, that they did not survive
*10:04.460- 10:06.220* :  being taken out of the incubators,
*10:06.800- 10:07.800* :  which are now without power
*10:08.120- 10:10.840* :  and being put on normal, awful beds.
*10:11.160- 10:13.440* :  And sadly, the number seems to be increasing.
*10:13.500- 10:14.820* :  Actually, it seems to be a matter of time
*10:14.820- 10:16.620* :  before more of those premature babies die
*10:16.620- 10:18.640* :  and I've been speaking to aid agencies
*10:18.640- 10:21.000* :  or mourning who have been saying that it is
*10:21.280- 10:23.340* :  kind of impossible really to evacuate them
*10:23.380- 10:25.000* :  because it would be a very difficult operation
*10:25.000- 10:27.380* :  to evacuate premature babies in peacetime,
*10:27.380- 10:30.320* :  let alone surrounded by sniper fire and artillery fire.
*10:30.540- 10:31.760* :  And even though these Israelis say
*10:31.760- 10:34.500* :  that they would try to help with an evacuation corridor
*10:34.500- 10:37.020* :  for the premature babies, I think, hope of saving them
*10:37.020- 10:37.940* :  is running out fast.
*10:38.500- 10:39.620* :  And that is very much seen, I think,
*10:39.620- 10:42.200* :  Robin has a symbol of just the desperation on the ground.
*10:42.380- 10:44.380* :  I mean, our shifa was the largest hospital in Gaza,
*10:44.740- 10:45.820* :  had about 600 beds.
*10:46.040- 10:48.360* :  There are still hundreds of civilian sheltering
*10:48.620- 10:49.600* :  in the forecourt there,
*10:49.720- 10:52.360* :  but it's become not only the center of fighting this morning,
*10:52.360- 10:54.280* :  but the center of kind of claim and counterclaim
*10:54.280- 10:55.860* :  between the Israeli and Palestinian side
*10:55.860- 10:58.240* :  because the Israeli's claim that shifa conceals
*10:58.240- 11:00.720* :  and network of underground tunnels that belong to Hamas.
*11:00.820- 11:01.760* :  Hamas denies that.
*11:01.920- 11:04.080* :  On that point, Mark, I heard spokesman
*11:04.080- 11:06.080* :  for the Israel Defence Forces yesterday saying
*11:06.180- 11:08.460* :  they did take several hundred litres of fuel
*11:08.460- 11:10.000* :  close to the hospital and it was Hamas
*11:10.000- 11:12.300* :  who prevented the fuel from being collected and used.
*11:12.480- 11:14.820* :  Where are we on either side's explanation
*11:14.820- 11:17.040* :  on the fuel to be used to power the hospitals?
*11:17.280- 11:19.960* :  Well, the Israelis have released an audio recording
*11:19.960- 11:23.680* :  which they say was a conversation between one of their
*11:23.960- 11:26.360* :  people on the ground and somebody from the hospital
*11:26.360- 11:27.940* :  saying that they were going to be dropping
*11:27.940- 11:31.460* :  300 litres of fuel at a crossroads close to the hospital.
*11:32.120- 11:33.960* :  And the recording purports to suggest
*11:34.640- 11:36.760* :  that the Hamas official on the other side says
*11:36.760- 11:39.180* :  that the hospital director does not want the fuel.
*11:39.780- 11:41.760* :  Now, it's a very short clip.
*11:41.760- 11:45.240* :  The Israelis have been consistently sort of feeding audio
*11:45.240- 11:47.960* :  to the international media and that Hamas denies
*11:47.960- 11:49.700* :  we can't verify the veracity of it.
*11:50.160- 11:52.160* :  But whether or not it was delivered,
*11:52.700- 11:55.900* :  300 litres of fuel is thought to be enough
*11:55.900- 11:57.920* :  to power one generator for half an hour
*11:57.920- 12:00.240* :  so that would provide scan comfort for a hospital
*12:00.560- 12:03.820* :  large parts of which are now completely out of service.
*12:04.300- 12:07.020* :  And just finally, we saw last week
*12:07.080- 12:09.580* :  the Israeli military initiating these kind of
*12:09.760- 12:12.980* :  three or four hour pauses in their military operations
*12:13.640- 12:14.780* :  humanitarian pauses.
*12:14.780- 12:17.100* :  Is there any evidence of that again today around
*12:17.100- 12:19.520* :  our shift forward or in the north to allow people
*12:19.520- 12:20.820* :  who want to leave to head south?
*12:20.980- 12:24.060* :  To be frank, I'm not sure whether it really has ever happened.
*12:24.300- 12:25.980* :  I mean, we've been trying to get to the bottom of this
*12:25.980- 12:28.480* :  over the last few days with our teams on the ground
*12:28.480- 12:31.180* :  and with various aid agency contacts that we have.
*12:31.660- 12:34.800* :  And I think it appears that these are sort of
*12:34.800- 12:39.680* :  unofficial ad hoc stoppages here and there in some areas.
*12:39.680- 12:42.480* :  But there's no sense that they've been
*12:42.480- 12:44.440* :  kind of officially announced by the Israeli Army.
*12:44.440- 12:46.320* :  What the Israeli Army has announced
*12:46.320- 12:48.280* :  is evacuation corridors south.
*12:48.980- 12:51.180* :  But, you know, we initially thought these
*12:51.180- 12:52.180* :  were going to be two separate things.
*12:52.460- 12:54.060* :  Stoppages on the ground in Gaza City
*12:54.060- 12:55.960* :  and in the north to reach aid
*12:56.280- 12:57.820* :  and evacuation corridors south.
*12:58.380- 13:00.440* :  I think what has happened is that the sort of two
*13:00.440- 13:01.380* :  have become conflated.
*13:02.320- 13:03.740* :  Mark Lohan in the south of Israel.
*13:04.260- 13:05.960* :  Well, it's now five weeks since Hamas
*13:05.960- 13:08.480* :  massacred more than 1,200 people in Israel
*13:08.920- 13:10.760* :  and seized hundreds more as hostages.
*13:11.400- 13:14.100* :  Since then, Hamas officials say well, over 11,000
*13:14.100- 13:15.840* :  people in Gaza have been killed
*13:15.840- 13:17.660* :  in Israel's military operation.
*13:18.320- 13:19.900* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*13:19.900- 13:22.700* :  assesses what could happen next in Gaza and in Israel.
*13:23.200- 13:26.440* :  News teams can't cross into Gaza so they come to Storot.
*13:26.880- 13:29.420* :  The nearest Israeli town to look in.
*13:30.320- 13:32.160* :  Perhaps the biggest question is what happens
*13:32.180- 13:33.660* :  in Gaza the day after?
*13:33.980- 13:35.120* :  Who's going to be in charge?
*13:36.400- 13:37.560* :  Israeli occupiers?
*13:38.860- 13:39.940* :  An international force?
*13:41.200- 13:43.880* :  Palestinians, if so, which Palestinians?
*13:45.220- 13:46.260* :  This time it's different.
*13:46.860- 13:49.120* :  The cost in lives from the Hamas attacks
*13:49.120- 13:52.400* :  to Israel's response has thrust the conflict
*13:52.820- 13:54.080* :  into unknown territory.
*13:54.800- 13:55.940* :  With Israel on the attack,
*13:55.940- 14:00.180* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected America's day after plan.
*14:01.960- 14:04.240* :  The US wants the Palestinian authority
*14:04.780- 14:07.180* :  rivals to Hamas to run Gaza after the fighting
*14:07.640- 14:10.040* :  and then a Palestinian stay alongside Israel.
*14:11.340- 14:14.280* :  Netanyahu opposes Palestinian independence
*14:14.900- 14:17.220* :  and wants Israel to control security.
*14:19.040- 14:21.360* :  Danny Atom, once the Israeli spy chief,
*14:21.720- 14:24.920* :  said that's why the Prime Minister snubbed Israel's
*14:25.260- 14:26.420* :  most important ally.
*14:26.860- 14:31.060* :  Israel should not stay too long in the Gaza Strip.
*14:31.360- 14:36.960* :  One, secondly, we'll not be able to live the Gaza Strip
*14:37.840- 14:40.680* :  unless all the objectives are in our hands
*14:40.680- 14:43.480* :  back in a peaceful situation.
*14:44.300- 14:46.800* :  And we won, we succeed.
*14:47.540- 14:49.520* :  Hamas, we won, the war against Hamas.
*14:50.200- 14:51.920* :  Now, there is a need to define,
*14:51.920- 14:54.860* :  what does it mean exactly to win?
*14:55.780- 15:00.720* :  I define it as the collapse of Hamas,
*15:00.720- 15:03.280* :  as a body, as an organization,
*15:04.380- 15:07.280* :  losing its chain of command.
*15:08.820- 15:10.740* :  Israelis are united behind their army,
*15:10.740- 15:12.200* :  but not their Prime Minister.
*15:13.700- 15:16.260* :  These demonstrators, outside his office in Jerusalem,
*15:16.860- 15:20.600* :  believe he is pandering to the hard-line Jewish nationalists
*15:21.100- 15:22.120* :  who keep him in power.
*15:23.060- 15:24.460* :  Another big question for Israelis
*15:24.460- 15:27.640* :  is the future of their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*15:28.000- 15:30.920* :  He was a divisive figure before the 7th of October.
*15:31.600- 15:35.180* :  And since then, a lot of Israelis have started to blame him
*15:35.960- 15:39.600* :  for the security and intelligence and military errors
*15:40.760- 15:44.340* :  that allowed Hamas to attack with devastating consequences.
*15:46.360- 15:49.560* :  The pain and hatred unleashed since the 7th of October
*15:49.940- 15:52.420* :  might overwhelm all those who still believe in peace,
*15:52.500- 15:53.820* :  not permanent war.
*15:56.540- 15:58.200* :  Almost every day in the West Bank,
*15:58.200- 16:01.240* :  they bury more Palestinians killed in Israeli raids.
*16:01.780- 16:04.200* :  This side of the occupied Palestinian territories
*16:04.780- 16:06.660* :  is becoming the war's next background.
*16:07.740- 16:09.560* :  The only answer, West Indeed, is say,
*16:09.560- 16:11.780* :  is to revive the two-state solution,
*16:12.780- 16:14.500* :  independent Palestine alongside Israel,
*16:14.940- 16:18.000* :  a failed idea that survives only as a slogan.
*16:19.140- 16:22.220* :  Sabri Saddam, an advisor to the Palestinian President,
*16:23.000- 16:24.140* :  has heard it all before.
*16:24.960- 16:26.000* :  I think it's empty.
*16:26.000- 16:28.660* :  It's meaningless if it continues to be this way.
*16:28.780- 16:31.680* :  If you want to do things, don't just talk.
*16:31.680- 16:34.740* :  You need to walk the talk, and you need to implement things.
*16:34.740- 16:37.680* :  If we continue with this sloganeering
*16:37.680- 16:40.580* :  without any results whatsoever, we're getting nowhere.
*16:42.520- 16:45.900* :  When this war started, Joe Biden warned Israel not to be blinded
*16:45.900- 16:50.760* :  by rage as America was after the 9-11 attacks by Al Qaeda.
*16:51.560- 16:54.600* :  Now, Israel's tactics are alarming the Americans.
*16:55.320- 16:56.980* :  They reiterate support for Israel,
*16:56.980- 17:01.200* :  but, say, too many Palestinians have been killed by the war machine
*17:01.200- 17:02.900* :  that helped Israel build.
*17:03.760- 17:04.860* :  Jeremy Bowen, reporting.
*17:05.660- 17:06.960* :  Now, as we record this podcast,
*17:06.960- 17:09.760* :  thousands of people are lining the streets of Manchester,
*17:09.760- 17:12.660* :  here in the UK, for the funeral procession
*17:12.660- 17:15.980* :  of one of English football's greatest ever players, Bobby Chalton.
*17:16.580- 17:19.800* :  So Bobby was 86 when he died last month after a fall
*17:19.800- 17:22.600* :  at a nursing home where he was receiving care for dementia.
*17:23.160- 17:25.720* :  A correspondence Katie Gornal is at Old Trafford,
*17:25.720- 17:27.820* :  the stadium where he appeared so many times
*17:27.860- 17:29.940* :  for his beloved Manchester United.
*17:30.700- 17:33.020* :  So Bobby Chalton was adored around the world,
*17:33.020- 17:35.060* :  but especially at Manchester United.
*17:35.560- 17:39.080* :  Very soon, the funeral cortege will arrive here at Old Trafford.
*17:39.140- 17:43.200* :  Home of the club, where So Bobby made more than 750 appearances
*17:43.860- 17:44.880* :  during a glittering career.
*17:45.440- 17:47.720* :  Members of the club's youth team will give a guard of honour
*17:47.720- 17:50.900* :  as the cortege passes in front of the United Trinity statue
*17:50.900- 17:54.360* :  where So Bobby is immortalised alongside fellow greats,
*17:54.360- 17:55.840* :  George Best and Dennis Law.
*17:56.380- 17:59.180* :  The funeral for the 1966 World Cup winner
*17:59.180- 18:02.860* :  will be a private service attended by around a thousand people.
*18:03.240- 18:05.540* :  Guests will include stars from across football.
*18:06.060- 18:08.340* :  Manchester United said it would be a celebration
*18:08.380- 18:11.080* :  of So Bobby's incredible life as a family man
*18:11.080- 18:14.320* :  and one of the finest footballers that England has ever produced.
*18:14.920- 18:16.020* :  Katie Gornal in Manchester.
*18:19.420- 18:22.420* :  Coming up in this podcast as Poland's new Parliament meets
*18:22.420- 18:26.620* :  for the first time, the LGBTQ community there hopes for a better future.
*18:27.020- 18:29.120* :  People in my vote are very strict.
*18:29.400- 18:31.100* :  They are doubting everyone.
*18:31.740- 18:33.980* :  I can be myself here.
*18:39.780- 18:41.500* :  How do we navigate in space?
*18:41.740- 18:44.800* :  Our humans naturally clean and tidy.
*18:45.060- 18:46.940* :  What exactly is this quantum computer?
*18:47.120- 18:48.940* :  Can smell and hiss your appetite?
*18:49.140- 18:52.120* :  Crowd science is the podcast that takes your science questions
*18:52.600- 18:54.040* :  and goes in search of the answers.
*18:54.420- 18:55.980* :  My question for crowd science is,
*18:56.260- 18:58.000* :  our artistic brains different.
*18:58.180- 19:01.580* :  Stick with me because there's been some really fascinating research into this.
*19:01.740- 19:03.940* :  That's Crowd Science from the BBC World Service.
*19:04.120- 19:05.320* :  I love this question.
*19:05.620- 19:08.220* :  Just search for Crowd Science wherever you found this podcast.
*19:08.220- 19:08.680* :  Wow.

*19:47.400- 19:49.080* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:49.080- 19:52.660* :  Now, let's get an update on a story that we covered last time round.
*19:52.680- 19:56.260* :  Rescuers in India pumping oxygen into a collapsed tunnel
*19:56.700- 20:00.000* :  as they step up their efforts to reach dozens of construction workers
*20:00.000- 20:03.220* :  who were trapped there after a long stretch of the structure
*20:03.220- 20:05.960* :  in an area of the Himalayas collapsed on Sunday.
*20:06.520- 20:09.600* :  It's hoped those who were trapped could be freed by the end of the day.
*20:11.840- 20:13.940* :  We've been informed that everyone is safe.
*20:13.940- 20:16.700* :  We've given them supplies of chips, food, and water.
*20:17.300- 20:18.920* :  And we hope to rescue them by today.
*20:18.920- 20:22.780* :  When we communicated with them, they told us that 40 people are trapped,
*20:22.780- 20:24.040* :  but all are safe.
*20:24.620- 20:27.740* :  Well, for more on this, I spoke to our reporter, Zuber Ahmed, who's in Delhi.
*20:28.360- 20:30.560* :  Multiple rescue teams are on the ground.
*20:31.140- 20:34.000* :  And I spoke to our local reporter there
*20:34.000- 20:37.440* :  who has spoken to several officials, rescue team members,
*20:37.440- 20:43.580* :  who appear to suggest that the rescue operation may continue until tomorrow.
*20:44.080- 20:48.400* :  And only after looking at the progress made will they be able to say
*20:48.820- 20:52.980* :  by when these workers can be brought out of the tunnel.
*20:53.560- 20:57.400* :  The workers who are inside were actually preparing
*20:57.400- 21:00.100* :  to celebrate the Diwali Festival yesterday.
*21:00.100- 21:05.440* :  Just hours before they were to go out of the tunnel, this incident happened.
*21:05.880- 21:09.320* :  So our local reporter spoke to several co-workers
*21:09.620- 21:10.760* :  and their relatives.
*21:11.380- 21:14.980* :  Most of them are from Bihar and would they say in other states.
*21:15.460- 21:18.640* :  And he could look at, you know, their actions faces.
*21:18.980- 21:21.980* :  As the time is passing, they are getting more and more anxious
*21:21.980- 21:25.560* :  and they are urging the officials to increase
*21:25.560- 21:27.800* :  and hasten their rescue operations.
*21:28.200- 21:30.880* :  But the trouble is, the more debris they remove,
*21:30.880- 21:33.480* :  the more it is falling from all sides.
*21:33.480- 21:36.640* :  And that is making their efforts all the more difficult.
*21:37.160- 21:39.540* :  And just quickly, they can hear the people inside.
*21:39.540- 21:42.360* :  And there's some form of communication, there's some kind of sound,
*21:42.360- 21:44.400* :  they're confident that they're alive.
*21:44.820- 21:48.080* :  Yes, earlier they were talking through walkie-talkies,
*21:48.200- 21:50.920* :  but now the batteries seem to have died.
*21:51.340- 21:54.560* :  So now what they've done is they've inserted a hollow pipe
*21:55.060- 21:58.520* :  and through which they're speaking to each other intermittently
*21:58.900- 22:03.620* :  and also trying to send food and oxygen and bottle waters
*22:03.920- 22:05.500* :  and other stuff that people need.
*22:05.500- 22:08.140* :  But they seem to be in good spirit as of now.
*22:08.660- 22:11.960* :  But as time passes, things are becoming more difficult
*22:11.960- 22:15.500* :  and relatives waiting outside and co-workers waiting outside,
*22:15.840- 22:16.600* :  are getting nervous.
*22:17.240- 22:18.360* :  Zubea Ahmed in Delhi.
*22:18.780- 22:21.020* :  Let's go to the Philippines now where it's safe to say
*22:21.020- 22:23.580* :  the country's former president, Rodrigo Duterte,
*22:24.140- 22:25.740* :  was not very open to criticism.
*22:26.380- 22:28.900* :  But now one of his fiercest critics, Laila Delima,
*22:28.900- 22:32.160* :  a former justice secretary who spent six years in jail
*22:32.160- 22:35.200* :  on drugs-related charges, has been released on bail.
*22:35.700- 22:38.420* :  Laila Delima waved and shouted free at last
*22:38.420- 22:41.260* :  as she came out of Manila's National Police headquarters.
*22:41.940- 22:47.460* :  For years, my whole being has been crying out
*22:47.600- 22:50.120* :  for justice and freedom.
*22:51.340- 22:53.580* :  But I don't want to be sad, we're bitter today.
*22:54.260- 22:58.180* :  This is a moment of triumph and joy.
*22:58.800- 23:01.260* :  Well, our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head has more.
*23:02.020- 23:04.320* :  Laila Delima is the most high-profile prisoner
*23:04.320- 23:06.940* :  in the Philippines and one of several critics
*23:06.940- 23:08.940* :  of former president Rodrigo Duterte
*23:08.940- 23:12.700* :  who found themselves facing a series of criminal charges.
*23:13.580- 23:16.160* :  She's been kept in prison for nearly seven years,
*23:16.640- 23:19.620* :  despite the collapse of nearly all the cases against her
*23:19.960- 23:22.540* :  after key witnesses retracted their testimony.
*23:23.380- 23:24.960* :  Now she's been released on bail
*23:24.960- 23:27.520* :  while awaiting the outcome of the final case.
*23:28.260- 23:30.880* :  Her complaint that the charges were politically driven
*23:31.340- 23:33.240* :  has been supported by human rights groups
*23:33.240- 23:36.680* :  and many other governments who've long called for her release.
*23:37.560- 23:39.020* :  That has now been made possible
*23:39.440- 23:42.560* :  after President Duterte's departure from office last year
*23:43.040- 23:45.840* :  and his replacement by President Ferdinand Marcos,
*23:45.840- 23:49.520* :  a one-time ally who's no longer close to Mr Duterte.
*23:50.260- 23:52.760* :  The former president is also facing an investigation
*23:52.760- 23:54.880* :  at the International Criminal Court
*23:55.320- 23:56.720* :  over the thousands of deaths
*23:56.720- 23:59.180* :  during his brutal anti-drugs campaign.
*24:00.500- 24:02.220* :  Well, here in Europe, Poland's parliament
*24:02.220- 24:05.300* :  is sitting for the first time since elections last month
*24:05.300- 24:07.500* :  when the governing party lost its majority.
*24:08.120- 24:10.480* :  Negotiations to form a new government are ongoing.
*24:10.480- 24:12.460* :  They're expected to end eventually
*24:13.040- 24:15.140* :  with an opposition coalition taking over.
*24:15.660- 24:18.460* :  It's likely to be particularly significant for gay people
*24:18.620- 24:21.560* :  and other members of the LGBTQ community in Poland
*24:21.580- 24:25.400* :  because for them it's one of the worst places to live in the EU.
*24:26.080- 24:27.880* :  They're hoping a new opposition-led government
*24:27.880- 24:30.900* :  will bring an end to years of hostile rhetoric and policy.
*24:31.560- 24:33.240* :  Sarah Reinsford has more from Warsaw.
*24:34.040- 24:36.920* :  We've got some icons like Elton John,
*24:36.920- 24:38.980* :  Freddie Mercury, David Bowie.
*24:39.180- 24:42.160* :  This was Rainbow Friday in a Warsaw High School,
*24:42.560- 24:44.500* :  where I got a tour of the stands teenagers
*24:44.500- 24:45.880* :  that set up in a corridor
*24:46.380- 24:48.960* :  to help educate their classmates about diversity.
*24:49.380- 24:50.440* :  What about this table here?
*24:50.480- 24:52.420* :  Here, it's let's be on stand.
*24:53.440- 24:56.200* :  As it looked around, a young woman called Stacy approached me
*24:56.560- 24:57.280* :  eager to talk.
*24:58.040- 24:59.260* :  I chose this school because
*25:00.120- 25:01.620* :  I just want to be myself.
*25:01.920- 25:03.980* :  People in my vote are very strict.
*25:03.980- 25:05.940* :  They're judging everyone.
*25:06.600- 25:08.840* :  I just can be myself here.
*25:10.200- 25:13.000* :  Stacy traveled hundreds of miles to join this school
*25:13.280- 25:14.660* :  because it's been ranked as safe
*25:15.060- 25:17.600* :  in a league table that's maintained by students themselves.
*25:18.620- 25:21.420* :  She's transgender and she really struggled growing up
*25:21.700- 25:22.960* :  in a small Polish village.
*25:23.500- 25:26.160* :  It was a really hard time for me.
*25:26.340- 25:28.500* :  I just hate what I feel like.
*25:29.280- 25:31.040* :  And I just wanted to die.
*25:32.580- 25:36.280* :  I just don't want to leave anymore back then.
*25:36.900- 25:38.380* :  No, you really feel better.
*25:38.540- 25:39.480* :  I'm feeling better.
*25:39.740- 25:41.660* :  I'm just better.
*25:47.480- 25:50.540* :  The teenagers had also invited a young LGBT activist,
*25:50.540- 25:53.220* :  Dominic Kuts, to talk about tolerance.
*25:53.820- 25:55.800* :  That's not something Poland's conservative government
*25:55.800- 25:58.480* :  has been preaching in its eight years in power.
*25:59.420- 26:01.120* :  But there were elections last month,
*26:01.480- 26:04.520* :  and an opposition coalition is now preparing to take over.
*26:05.340- 26:07.660* :  Dominic says ending the hostile talk
*26:07.660- 26:11.380* :  from political podiums and TV screens is critical.
*26:11.760- 26:13.660* :  It was a really tough time for the community
*26:14.180- 26:17.060* :  because we heard the statements like
*26:17.060- 26:19.600* :  LGBTQ plus is not people but ideology.
*26:20.360- 26:22.120* :  So that was really, really harsh.
*26:22.700- 26:26.920* :  What we see is a huge risk on mental health of young people.
*26:31.740- 26:34.160* :  A way from Warsaw, things can be tougher still.
*26:34.940- 26:38.860* :  We travel to a town that's been labeled an LGBT free zone.
*26:39.780- 26:42.220* :  In Skarnawitsa, the Council passed a resolution
*26:42.220- 26:45.640* :  in defence of what it called traditional family values.
*26:46.300- 26:49.160* :  It publicly denounced same-sex marriage and adoption
*26:49.760- 26:50.980* :  and pride marches.
*26:51.840- 26:54.480* :  At one point, a third of all councils in Poland
*26:54.480- 26:56.160* :  had adopted similar charters.
*26:56.660- 26:57.820* :  There are lots of them were withdrawn
*26:58.280- 27:00.500* :  when the EU threatened to withhold funding.
*27:03.460- 27:05.260* :  We tried to talk to the local councillors
*27:05.500- 27:06.720* :  but there was no one at their offices
*27:07.000- 27:09.140* :  and no reply to our calls or our emails.
*27:12.140- 27:13.560* :  But we did meet Mateusz.
*27:13.720- 27:17.500* :  He's 18 and he describes himself as a queer activist.
*27:18.180- 27:20.120* :  I saw people on a barge made kick mails,
*27:20.300- 27:21.200* :  on a fight with me.
*27:21.380- 27:22.040* :  Have you been passed?
*27:22.140- 27:22.600* :  That's happened.
*27:22.660- 27:24.540* :  I mean, that's kind of scary for me.
*27:24.980- 27:26.900* :  Mateusz calls the Council's resolution
*27:27.300- 27:29.220* :  part of a wave of hate here.
*27:29.580- 27:30.500* :  It's scary for me.
*27:30.500- 27:32.980* :  I mean, I love in the country, in New York, New York.
*27:32.980- 27:35.340* :  But where is this value for your opinion?
*27:35.860- 27:36.840* :  For where is liberty?
*27:37.700- 27:37.860* :  Where?
*27:38.640- 27:40.740* :  The big reforms will still be a battle.
*27:41.320- 27:45.000* :  Poland's Conservative President has a veto on any legislation.
*27:45.560- 27:47.700* :  But after years of open hostility,
*27:48.160- 27:51.660* :  LGBT people here do sense a change in the climate.
*27:52.680- 27:54.280* :  Sarah Reinsford reporting from Warsaw.
*27:55.020- 27:57.640* :  The BBC has seen figures that show climate change targets
*27:57.640- 28:01.240* :  are being ignored by almost every major energy company.
*28:01.920- 28:05.640* :  Researchers in Germany suggest 96% of the world's
*28:05.640- 28:08.640* :  energy companies plan to drill new oil and gas fields,
*28:09.540- 28:11.360* :  despite official warnings against doing so.
*28:11.840- 28:12.540* :  Here's Richard Bilton.
*28:13.120- 28:16.640* :  The world has made a pledge to keep average temperature rise
*28:16.640- 28:20.600* :  to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
*28:21.300- 28:24.820* :  Later this month, COP28, the UN's climate conference
*28:24.820- 28:26.200* :  will assess progress.
*28:27.140- 28:30.060* :  To meet the target, the international energy agency
*28:30.060- 28:33.020* :  says current fossil fuel reserves can be used,
*28:33.520- 28:36.340* :  but no new oil and gas fields should be opened.
*28:37.060- 28:41.040* :  Researchers in Germany say the industry is ignoring the warning.
*28:41.700- 28:46.300* :  They say 675 of the world's 700 biggest energy companies
*28:46.300- 28:48.380* :  are planning to drill new fields.
*28:48.960- 28:52.560* :  Attie Birl is the president of the International Energy Agency.
*28:52.840- 28:56.420* :  What worries me is that many of the leaders of the oil industry
*28:56.660- 29:01.900* :  say our company, our strategy, is in line with the global climate targets.
*29:02.220- 29:07.960* :  You cannot say that our company's strategy is in line with the climate targets
*29:08.340- 29:13.280* :  and at the same time plan to increase your oil, gas or coal production.
*29:13.660- 29:17.140* :  The industry says its meeting demand as part of a transition
*29:17.140- 29:21.640* :  to greener fuels, but last year we used more coal than ever before
*29:22.040- 29:25.060* :  and this year is expected to be the highest for oil use.
*29:25.620- 29:28.660* :  Richard Bilton reporting, now let's end on trees, lots of them,
*29:29.140- 29:31.060* :  and I really mean lots of trees.
*29:31.760- 29:35.540* :  Kenya wants to plant 15 billion trees by 2033,
*29:36.180- 29:38.640* :  and the first step in that decade-long ambitious plan
*29:38.640- 29:40.880* :  starts today with a public holiday for everyone.
*29:41.540- 29:44.260* :  I spoke to our senior Africa correspondent Anne Sawey
*29:44.260- 29:48.140* :  who had just returned from a tree planting at a primary school near Nairobi.
*29:48.560- 29:52.480* :  Hey, so people as young as seven children would come with their parents there.
*29:52.920- 29:56.640* :  I met one father who said that he was trying to get his sons to plant their age
*29:56.640- 30:01.640* :  and I asked him if he had his and he said he had planted more than 20 trees
*30:02.320- 30:03.640* :  and they ran out of seedlings actually.
*30:03.680- 30:05.280* :  So such is the enthusiasm.
*30:05.920- 30:07.460* :  Kenyans have received this project with.
*30:07.860- 30:12.360* :  The government said that they were distributing 150 million seedlings
*30:12.920- 30:15.560* :  if what I have seen today is anything to go by.
*30:15.980- 30:18.640* :  There's a chance that there are people who went home
*30:18.640- 30:21.240* :  having not planted as many trees as they would have wanted.
*30:21.600- 30:23.640* :  Can I ask you, I mean, what's behind this effort?
*30:23.640- 30:26.300* :  I mean, a public holiday, it must be costing a fortune.
*30:26.300- 30:30.440* :  Is this a new drive in terms of climate change in the environment?
*30:30.500- 30:32.060* :  Or is this an about turn?
*30:32.260- 30:34.560* :  Well, it is about climate and as you know,
*30:34.560- 30:38.540* :  the current president William Ruto has been particularly a champion
*30:38.540- 30:41.600* :  for combating the effects of climate change.
*30:42.400- 30:45.200* :  However, the holiday came as a surprise to many people
*30:45.200- 30:49.640* :  and it was gazetted just last week and it came as a surprise.
*30:49.640- 30:53.640* :  There have been, you know, a few people grumbling, especially employers,
*30:53.640- 30:57.320* :  saying that, you know, it's loss of business a whole day lost.
*30:57.840- 31:00.460* :  But generally, the reception has been very good
*31:00.460- 31:03.620* :  because across the political divide, even in the private sector,
*31:03.620- 31:05.580* :  people recognize that this is something important.
*31:05.580- 31:07.540* :  This is something that needs to be done.
*31:07.860- 31:09.260* :  And can I just ask you quickly in Kenya,
*31:09.260- 31:11.640* :  what are the particular challenges in terms of the environment
*31:11.640- 31:12.600* :  and climate change?
*31:12.600- 31:14.540* :  Is it pollution with traffic?
*31:14.540- 31:16.640* :  Is it other things about the land being poisoned?
*31:16.640- 31:18.020* :  Or what are the challenges?
*31:18.340- 31:21.480* :  Well, compared to many other countries, pollution years is a problem.
*31:21.480- 31:22.960* :  It's not as big as a problem.
*31:23.940- 31:27.380* :  One of the biggest problems is that the forest cover has been depleted
*31:27.800- 31:28.500* :  in this country.
*31:28.500- 31:30.960* :  It's just about 7% at the moment.
*31:31.560- 31:35.520* :  And the country is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
*31:35.520- 31:40.000* :  So we have come from years of recurrent droughts, failed rains,
*31:40.440- 31:44.280* :  and then immediately after that, now we have the El Nino going on
*31:44.280- 31:47.880* :  and that has caused flooding in a part of the country.
*31:48.240- 31:49.720* :  And that's a huge problem.
*31:49.960- 31:52.400* :  You know, it's costing lives, it's costing livelihoods.
*31:53.060- 31:57.580* :  And therefore, there is this push to try and reverse the effects of climate change.
*31:57.860- 31:59.520* :  Just quickly, Anne, have you planted your tree?
*31:59.660- 32:01.040* :  I am going to plant a tree.
*32:01.040- 32:05.440* :  Actually, not just a tree, but fruit tree because I need to eat from it as well.
*32:06.060- 32:09.060* :  Good stuff from Anne Sawyer, getting involved with her fruit trees.
*32:12.140- 32:13.060* :  That's all from us for now.
*32:13.060- 32:16.220* :  But before we go, at the end of this month, world leaders are meeting
*32:16.220- 32:18.380* :  at the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai.
*32:18.380- 32:20.260* :  Do you have a question for them?
*32:20.600- 32:21.800* :  Well, we'd like to hear from you.
*32:21.860- 32:24.700* :  No question on climate change is too big or too small.
*32:25.180- 32:29.160* :  Email us at the usual address, globalpodcast at BBC.co.uk.
*32:29.160- 32:30.820* :  We hope to hear from you soon.

*32:42.880- 32:44.100* :  we're at Global NewsPod.
*32:44.620- 32:46.300* :  This edition was mixed by George Baines,
*32:46.300- 32:49.400* :  the producer was Tracy Gordon, the editor, is Karen Martin.
*32:49.560- 32:52.080* :  I'm Robin Brandt, until next time, thanks for listening and goodbye.
*33:00.400- 33:01.700* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mintmobile.
