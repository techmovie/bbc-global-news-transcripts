*02:29.860- 02:32.560* :  Stuck 30 meters below ground in a mineshaft.
*02:33.100- 02:33.620* :  Find out later.
*02:37.580- 02:40.140* :  We start there with the war in Israel and Gaza.
*02:40.140- 02:43.260* :  Israel's military says 50,000 Palestinians
*02:43.260- 02:46.560* :  have left Gaza City after Israeli forces
*02:46.560- 02:49.140* :  opened the main road, Salah Eldin Street,
*02:49.140- 02:51.820* :  which leads to the south of the Gaza Strip.
*02:52.200- 02:54.100* :  The chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari,
*02:54.100- 02:56.780* :  said a limited pause of five hours on Wednesday
*02:57.180- 02:58.420* :  was not a ceasefire.
*02:58.840- 03:02.180* :  The IDF continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza.
*03:02.700- 03:04.880* :  Hamas is a designated terror organization
*03:04.880- 03:08.260* :  by many Western governments, including the UK and the US.
*03:09.020- 03:11.200* :  Speaking through a translator, Mr. Hagari said
*03:11.200- 03:14.140* :  Israeli forces would continue to encourage people
*03:14.140- 03:16.200* :  to leave the Gaza City area
*03:16.700- 03:18.680* :  and added that Hamas has lost control
*03:18.900- 03:19.940* :  in the north of the territory.
*03:20.360- 03:23.260* :  Hamas has lost control and continues to lose control
*03:23.640- 03:24.880* :  in the north of the Gaza Strip.
*03:24.940- 03:26.820* :  Hamas leadership is detached.
*03:26.840- 03:30.160* :  It is sitting inside bunkers and they are detached
*03:30.160- 03:32.540* :  from the general gas and population.
*03:33.100- 03:35.960* :  Well, Hamas officials said at least 19 people were killed
*03:35.960- 03:38.860* :  in an Israeli air strike on a house near a hospital
*03:38.860- 03:42.440* :  in the Jabalya refugee camp in Northern Gaza on Wednesday.
*03:43.200- 03:45.700* :  As we heard earlier, many people are fleeing south,
*03:45.700- 03:48.380* :  but some have been telling the BBC that they've been
*03:48.380- 03:49.300* :  unable to leave.
*03:49.880- 03:52.780* :  Khaled is an aid worker in the Jabalya refugee camp
*03:52.780- 03:55.220* :  and he's sheltering in his home with his own
*03:55.220- 03:58.700* :  and several other families over 30 people in all.
*03:59.120- 04:00.780* :  He sent the BBC this voice message
*04:00.780- 04:02.980* :  because the internet connection is too unstable
*04:02.980- 04:03.980* :  for a mobile call.
*04:04.360- 04:05.480* :  They are pumping them.
*04:06.000- 04:09.300* :  They prevent any one to move.
*04:10.080- 04:14.440* :  Many friends and many farmers who trying and bought
*04:14.460- 04:21.220* :  white flag above the cars and trying to move from this way,
*04:21.220- 04:22.360* :  they are pumping them.
*04:23.140- 04:25.740* :  And many times they are trying to move,
*04:26.320- 04:30.960* :  but they are both chick points at this border.
*04:31.860- 04:37.180* :  Military chick points and it becomes a prisoner.
*04:38.360- 04:42.280* :  I have friend, he moved with his family
*04:42.860- 04:45.040* :  at the car and bought white flag.
*04:45.440- 04:49.540* :  They are pumping them and they live his car
*04:50.020- 04:54.460* :  and running with his family to take any shelter
*04:55.220- 04:57.320* :  from the bombing.
*04:58.140- 05:03.600* :  After to these, he back for the north of Gaza Strip.
*05:04.820- 05:06.100* :  Well, in another development,
*05:06.100- 05:08.460* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*05:08.460- 05:12.060* :  has appeared to dismiss reports that Hamas may be willing
*05:12.060- 05:15.140* :  to release a dozen hostages in exchange for a pause
*05:15.140- 05:17.140* :  in fighting of up to three days.
*05:17.840- 05:19.960* :  He insisted there can be no ceasefire
*05:20.160- 05:21.420* :  without the release of hostages.
*05:22.060- 05:25.620* :  It was not clear if he meant all 240 hostages
*05:25.880- 05:27.200* :  must first be released though.
*05:27.840- 05:29.200* :  Well, Christian Fraser, my colleagues,
*05:29.200- 05:31.840* :  spoke to the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams,
*05:31.840- 05:34.920* :  who's in Jerusalem and began first by asking him
*05:34.920- 05:36.620* :  about the Israeli offensive in Gaza
*05:37.120- 05:39.160* :  and the attack on the Jabali refugee camp.
*05:39.500- 05:43.980* :  We're seeing a really intense squeezing of that whole area
*05:43.980- 05:45.720* :  by the Israeli military.
*05:45.960- 05:49.120* :  So intent, are they on uprooting Hamas?
*05:49.120- 05:52.040* :  That pretty much everything so far is being destroyed
*05:52.720- 05:53.800* :  as they move forward.
*05:54.060- 05:56.620* :  They haven't yet reached places like Jabalia,
*05:57.060- 05:58.940* :  which is still by the sound of it being hit
*05:58.980- 06:00.420* :  by some kind of airstrike,
*06:00.700- 06:03.200* :  or indeed the center of Gaza city.
*06:03.620- 06:04.880* :  But when those moments come,
*06:05.400- 06:09.300* :  we are going to see increasing levels of destruction.
*06:09.380- 06:12.120* :  What the Israelis will be somewhat relieved
*06:12.120- 06:14.300* :  to see over the last couple of days
*06:14.300- 06:17.000* :  is this gradually increasing number of people
*06:17.000- 06:20.240* :  who have decided not to stay, but to flee.
*06:20.820- 06:23.720* :  The Israelis have managed to secure that corridor,
*06:23.720- 06:26.420* :  that road south from Gaza city
*06:26.700- 06:28.380* :  towards the southern part of the Gaza Strip
*06:28.820- 06:31.680* :  that is now secure enough a couple of days ago it wasn't.
*06:31.680- 06:32.940* :  There was fighting on that road.
*06:32.940- 06:35.960* :  It's now secure enough for people to make their way south.
*06:36.640- 06:39.180* :  And so that's why I think we're seeing these numbers picking up.
*06:39.180- 06:40.960* :  Some slight dispute about how many,
*06:40.960- 06:42.320* :  whether it's 40 or 50,000,
*06:42.380- 06:45.260* :  but it is obviously a significant number of people on the move.
*06:45.600- 06:49.640* :  But there are an awful lot of people still who are in Gaza city.
*06:49.640- 06:51.740* :  And that's why I think we're seeing the Israelis
*06:52.260- 06:54.760* :  not moving at a very fast pace,
*06:54.820- 06:57.120* :  but trying to be rather methodical,
*06:57.580- 06:59.840* :  although extremely destructive in the process.
*07:00.120- 07:01.520* :  There was some reporting today, Paul,
*07:01.900- 07:05.360* :  comes from a BBC source who is in touch with those
*07:05.740- 07:08.060* :  negotiating the release of the hostages
*07:08.060- 07:10.460* :  that there is a plan on the table,
*07:10.460- 07:13.420* :  maybe to release 12 hostages, half of them Americans,
*07:13.420- 07:17.340* :  in exchange for a three-day humanitarian pause.
*07:17.820- 07:19.140* :  Do you know any more about that
*07:19.140- 07:21.540* :  and what the sticking points might be?
*07:21.920- 07:25.680* :  I mean, this report has been around for a day or two now,
*07:25.680- 07:28.100* :  Christian, and it sort of comes in and out of focus
*07:28.100- 07:30.080* :  in a rather tantalizing way.
*07:30.500- 07:33.000* :  I suspect the problem is that three-day figure.
*07:33.320- 07:36.320* :  I do not detect any desire in the part of the Israeli government
*07:36.340- 07:41.080* :  to pause for that long to allow anything to unfold.
*07:41.620- 07:43.000* :  As far as the Israeli government is concerned,
*07:43.000- 07:45.820* :  that is an opportunity for Hamas to regroup,
*07:46.460- 07:48.700* :  rearm, arrange their forces,
*07:49.220- 07:50.760* :  and get ready for the next Israeli assault.
*07:50.820- 07:53.540* :  And they simply do not want to give Hamas any opportunity
*07:54.100- 07:54.720* :  to do that.
*07:55.020- 07:56.340* :  We are seeing the Israeli starting
*07:56.340- 07:59.040* :  to adopt this humanitarian pause terminology,
*07:59.040- 08:01.620* :  which the Americans have been pushing for some time.
*08:01.620- 08:04.680* :  They called that window of opportunity
*08:04.680- 08:06.840* :  of four or five hours today for people to leave.
*08:06.840- 08:09.040* :  They called that a humanitarian pause.
*08:09.660- 08:11.220* :  The Americans, when they were proposing it,
*08:11.220- 08:13.800* :  were talking about the provision of aid
*08:14.320- 08:16.440* :  and possibly progress on hostages.
*08:16.780- 08:19.080* :  It's obviously as far as the Israeli's concern today
*08:19.080- 08:21.660* :  and yesterday being used for a rather different purpose,
*08:21.660- 08:24.200* :  which is to allow civilians to leave.
*08:24.200- 08:28.600* :  But for whatever reason, we are seeing some temporary,
*08:28.600- 08:31.440* :  short-term, localized pauses
*08:32.040- 08:34.120* :  to allow the civilians to leave,
*08:34.760- 08:36.940* :  which obviously serves Israel's tactical
*08:36.940- 08:38.700* :  and strategic interests in the long run.
*08:39.160- 08:40.940* :  Paul Adams reporting from Jerusalem.
*08:40.940- 08:43.480* :  Well, our international editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*08:43.840- 08:46.660* :  has been embedded with Israeli troops inside Gaza.
*08:46.960- 08:49.580* :  His movements during an accompanied trip on Wednesday
*08:50.220- 08:52.540* :  were controlled by the Israel Defense Forces.
*08:52.780- 08:54.980* :  He sent this report, describing what he'd seen.
*08:57.500- 08:59.520* :  The Israeli Army took our BBC team
*08:59.520- 09:02.120* :  close to Gaza City in an armored vehicle
*09:02.500- 09:05.220* :  on condition that my reporting did not give away
*09:05.220- 09:06.280* :  military positions.
*09:06.800- 09:09.100* :  We also had to agree to military censorship
*09:09.140- 09:12.460* :  or video material, though not this radio report.
*09:13.080- 09:16.000* :  We traveled through an area that had been left a wasteland
*09:16.000- 09:18.800* :  after a month of a strikes in just over a week
*09:19.220- 09:20.240* :  of a ground invasion.
*09:20.680- 09:21.940* :  I didn't see a single building
*09:21.940- 09:24.180* :  that wasn't badly damaged or destroyed.
*09:24.580- 09:27.480* :  I also didn't see a single Palestinian civilian.
*09:29.960- 09:32.680* :  There were spasmonic blasts of Israeli tank shells
*09:33.160- 09:34.760* :  and bursts of machine gun fire.
*09:35.020- 09:37.960* :  The Israelis took us to erect three-story building
*09:37.960- 09:40.300* :  in the remains of a big housing development.
*09:41.060- 09:43.700* :  On a ground sheet, they spread out components they said
*09:43.700- 09:47.480* :  were partly assembled drones that were designed to bomb them.
*09:47.800- 09:49.660* :  Then they showed off two floors of workshops,
*09:49.660- 09:52.320* :  the military called it a terra factory.
*09:53.000- 09:55.300* :  On the third floor of the badly damaged building
*09:55.300- 09:57.540* :  was a family apartment, including a bedroom,
*09:57.540- 10:01.920* :  with three pink child's beds as well as dolls and other toys.
*10:02.620- 10:04.820* :  The deputy commander of the Fourth Armored Brigade,
*10:04.820- 10:08.800* :  Lieutenant Colonel Edo, I'm not permitted to use his full name,
*10:08.800- 10:12.740* :  said that was proof that Hamas used Palestinian civilians
*10:13.300- 10:14.140* :  as human shields.
*10:14.760- 10:17.080* :  When I asked the Lieutenant Colonel about the thousands
*10:17.080- 10:21.140* :  of civilians who've been killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza,
*10:21.140- 10:24.980* :  he rejected any suggestion that the Israel Defense Forces,
*10:24.980- 10:27.420* :  as the military is known here, was responsible.
*10:27.820- 10:29.700* :  The idea of this not aimed to kill the Mr. Bieber,
*10:30.180- 10:31.120* :  there's Hamas al-Obord.
*10:31.480- 10:33.200* :  It's hard to identify the Hamas.
*10:33.460- 10:36.000* :  I've been shot before and I want to have a large regime
*10:36.000- 10:38.020* :  picked by time before and I want to have for nowhere.
*10:38.380- 10:40.480* :  They came from a tunnel, tried to kill me.
*10:40.740- 10:45.300* :  FAC civilians here, I'll do all that is in my power, not to hum them.
*10:45.480- 10:47.940* :  The visitor to Gaza left two overriding impressions.
*10:47.940- 10:50.660* :  The first is the vast amount of military power.
*10:51.060- 10:54.180* :  Israel has brought in to fight the ground war.
*10:54.540- 10:56.440* :  I saw many troops and tanks.
*10:56.920- 10:59.000* :  The second is the level of destruction.
*10:59.500- 11:02.480* :  It will be extremely difficult for anyone to return
*11:02.680- 11:05.920* :  to live in the wrecked districts I was able to see.
*11:06.240- 11:08.020* :  It was on the same level of destruction
*11:08.020- 11:11.240* :  that I witnessed in the wars in Syria and Ukraine.
*11:12.060- 11:16.820* :  Jeremy Bowen, reporting from an area close to the outskirts of Gaza City.
*11:17.680- 11:20.240* :  While the world's attention has been on the situation in Gaza
*11:20.240- 11:22.500* :  and southern Israel over the past month,
*11:22.960- 11:27.760* :  lives are also being lost in the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967.
*11:28.380- 11:32.480* :  The UN says at least 150 Palestinians have been killed in the area
*11:32.920- 11:34.440* :  since October 7th.
*11:34.740- 11:36.200* :  The majority of them were civilians
*11:36.200- 11:38.960* :  and they included at least 44 children.
*11:39.600- 11:42.680* :  Some of those who died were at the hands of armed Jewish settlers
*11:42.680- 11:45.480* :  whose presence is illegal under international law.
*11:45.480- 11:49.360* :  The UN says three Israelis have also been killed in Palestinian attacks.
*11:50.040- 11:53.320* :  Our correspondent John Donerson has been to the Northern West Bank
*11:53.360- 11:54.780* :  to hear about what's happening there.
*11:55.340- 11:58.460* :  Some of you may find some elements of his reporting distressing.
*12:02.580- 12:06.040* :  This war is not only being fought in Gaza.
*12:07.840- 12:10.840* :  We went to this funeral in the West Bank town of Tulkaram
*12:11.360- 12:13.680* :  for four militants killed by Israel this week.
*12:14.600- 12:16.420* :  Gunman, fire into the air.
*12:17.680- 12:20.280* :  There's anger and defiance.
*12:23.220- 12:27.220* :  But also grief and fear of what's to come.
*12:27.780- 12:31.120* :  Even before the war, the West Bank was at boiling point
*12:31.120- 12:33.680* :  and the fury of what's happening in Gaza
*12:34.200- 12:36.640* :  as well as Israel's crackdown on militant here
*12:37.040- 12:39.760* :  as well as civilians have seen the temperament.
*12:42.060- 12:42.980* :  It's a dangerous moment.
*12:46.080- 12:49.000* :  We've been refugees in this camp for 75 years,
*12:49.380- 12:50.840* :  says this 82-year-old.
*12:51.500- 12:53.900* :  Everyone has just been laughing at us.
*12:57.000- 12:59.740* :  You say he tells us he works as an electrician.
*13:00.300- 13:01.880* :  He's also among the mourners.
*13:07.060- 13:08.300* :  He kills people, kills children.
*13:09.080- 13:10.840* :  Everything is stressed.
*13:12.040- 13:14.460* :  Does it feel like war here as well?
*13:15.440- 13:19.500* :  Maybe in two months, they'll stand the war here
*13:19.500- 13:21.360* :  in the West Bank with Gaza.
*13:23.000- 13:24.080* :  It's connected.
*13:24.180- 13:26.880* :  There's no gas and the West Bank. It's almost fine.
*13:28.040- 13:30.380* :  And in parts of the West Bank over the last month,
*13:30.900- 13:32.280* :  it's already looked like war.
*13:33.820- 13:35.620* :  Israel, it says, targeting terrorists,
*13:35.620- 13:38.860* :  including from Hamas, who are fighting back.
*13:40.880- 13:43.960* :  Israel has been using bulldozers to rip up the streets.
*13:44.740- 13:48.020* :  It says, as punishment for Palestinian attacks,
*13:51.600- 13:52.980* :  they came and destroyed the camp.
*13:53.020- 13:55.760* :  And then, they came again with bulldozers.
*13:56.260- 13:59.560* :  A young boy tells us, it's always like this, he says.
*14:01.920- 14:04.300* :  Israeli raids of Palestinian towns and villages
*14:04.400- 14:06.520* :  are happening night and day.
*14:09.720- 14:15.140* :  Tahir Mahami was just 15 when he was shot dead by an Israeli soldier.
*14:16.460- 14:20.420* :  His sister looked on in horror, as she recorded on her phone
*14:20.460- 14:22.480* :  the moment of his death.
*14:23.700- 14:25.940* :  And the UN says the majority of Palestinians
*14:25.940- 14:29.800* :  being killed in the West Bank are civilians, including children.
*14:31.060- 14:34.300* :  But they're suffering not just at the hands of the Israeli army,
*14:34.800- 14:36.760* :  but also armed Jewish settlers.
*14:37.740- 14:40.840* :  In this video, documented by the Israeli Human Rights Group,
*14:40.840- 14:45.360* :  a settler shoots a Palestinian at point-blank range
*14:45.820- 14:47.080* :  amid the olive groves.
*14:48.900- 14:51.400* :  In the background, an Israeli soldier looks on.
*14:52.280- 14:56.500* :  Palestinians say Israel allows settlers to act like a militia
*14:57.040- 14:57.720* :  within punty.
*15:01.000- 15:03.060* :  For some, it's become too much.
*15:03.440- 15:05.880* :  Muhammad Khaled's family has farmed sheep
*15:05.880- 15:08.220* :  in the occupied West Bank for generations.
*15:09.100- 15:11.140* :  But this week, they were packing up the line.
*15:11.840- 15:12.760* :  No, no, no, no.
*15:13.200- 15:16.500* :  We have lost our land, because we couldn't confront them.
*15:16.820- 15:20.220* :  We came out to fear no one was there to protect us.
*15:22.060- 15:25.760* :  Land has always been at the heart of this decade's long conflict.
*15:26.220- 15:28.700* :  And Palestinians are losing.
*15:30.120- 15:32.940* :  John Donerson reporting from the northern part of the West Bank,
*15:32.960- 15:36.040* :  while let's stay with the development related to the conflict,
*15:36.040- 15:38.640* :  because Israel's foreign spy agency Mossad
*15:39.040- 15:41.620* :  has said that it has helped foil and alleged plot
*15:41.620- 15:44.440* :  to launch attacks on the Jewish community in Brazil.
*15:45.180- 15:46.700* :  According to the Brazilian authorities,
*15:46.980- 15:50.060* :  two men arrested in Sao Paulo appear to have links
*15:50.060- 15:52.600* :  to the Lebanon-based Islamist group, Hezbollah.
*15:53.160- 15:54.920* :  Katie Watson reports from Sao Paulo.
*15:55.520- 15:57.960* :  According to a statement issued by Brazil's Federal Police,
*15:57.960- 16:00.680* :  the operation in which two suspects were arrested
*16:01.120- 16:02.960* :  was designed to stop terrorist preparations
*16:02.960- 16:06.100* :  and obtain information on possible recruitment of Brazilians
*16:06.100- 16:08.700* :  to commit extremist acts within the country.
*16:08.700- 16:12.440* :  Recruiters face charges of involvement in a terrorist organization
*16:12.940- 16:15.540* :  and participating in preparations for terrorist acts,
*16:15.540- 16:19.260* :  charges that carry a maximum sentence of 15 and a half years.
*16:19.920- 16:21.680* :  According to the Israeli Prime Minister's office,
*16:22.000- 16:25.440* :  Mossad worked with Brazilian and other international spy agencies.
*16:25.980- 16:28.440* :  It was apparently a network that spanned several countries.
*16:29.020- 16:29.900* :  Katie Watson in Brazil.
*16:32.860- 16:33.460* :  Still to come,
*16:33.640- 16:35.940* :  Ivan Miniv, who goes by the name of Holiday Boy,
*16:35.940- 16:37.160* :  starts with an ex,
*16:37.300- 16:43.720* :  he was criticized by the head of a government-backed censorship body.
*16:43.960- 16:47.340* :  Mystery surrounds the health of a Russian social media figure
*16:47.780- 16:50.640* :  who was conscripted into the army days after being criticized
*16:50.640- 16:51.620* :  by the authorities.

*17:29.800- 17:31.400* :  WeWork Adam Newman.
*17:31.780- 17:34.840* :  Adam's peak WeWork was worth $47 billion.
*17:35.960- 17:38.500* :  And Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*17:38.540- 17:41.100* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila
*17:41.100- 17:43.660* :  and made people do shots during business meetings.
*17:43.820- 17:46.600* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever,
*17:46.600- 17:48.640* :  to become the world's first trillionaire
*17:48.640- 17:50.300* :  and expand his company to Mars.

*18:25.360- 18:27.740* :  From a family of abominable snowmen
*18:28.380- 18:29.460* :  to a massive slug
*18:30.120- 18:32.160* :  or feeling like being on the edge of a cliff.
*18:33.080- 18:34.400* :  Amazing sports stories.

*18:37.060- 18:39.420* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:40.860- 18:42.660* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*18:43.480- 18:46.240* :  Now Ukraine is a step closer to starting the process
*18:46.360- 18:47.820* :  of joining the European Union
*18:47.820- 18:51.560* :  and the country is president Vladimir Zelensky has welcomed the news.
*18:51.900- 18:54.740* :  But it is likely to be a long, long process.
*18:55.540- 18:58.720* :  We heard more on that from our Brussels correspondent Sophia Batitzer.
*18:59.140- 19:02.760* :  It is very significant in the sense that this brings Ukraine
*19:02.760- 19:05.960* :  one step closer to joining the European Union,
*19:06.420- 19:08.660* :  which is something that Kiev really wants.
*19:09.300- 19:12.700* :  Now today, in Brussels, the president of the European Commission,
*19:12.700- 19:17.140* :  Ursula von der Leyen, said that Ukraine made excellent progress,
*19:17.720- 19:18.760* :  even during a war.
*19:18.760- 19:23.440* :  And it said that it implemented more than 90% of the reforms
*19:23.440- 19:25.920* :  that are needed to join the EU.
*19:26.360- 19:29.300* :  And you know, this will be very good news for president Zelensky
*19:29.420- 19:32.360* :  because he said that this positive decision today
*19:32.360- 19:37.440* :  will give fresh motivation to his troops that are fighting Russia,
*19:37.440- 19:41.440* :  especially at a time when the rock concerns about Ukraine fatigue
*19:41.440- 19:44.420* :  because of everything that is going on in the Middle East.
*19:44.460- 19:47.840* :  But in reality, the EU is facing a bit of a dilemma
*19:47.840- 19:53.440* :  because on one hand, they want to send a strong positive political signal
*19:53.440- 19:55.020* :  to the Ukrainian people.
*19:55.460- 19:57.840* :  You know, I spoke to an EU diplomat who told me that
*19:58.460- 20:00.760* :  if Ukraine does not join the EU,
*20:00.860- 20:02.860* :  Ukraine will be lost to Russia.
*20:02.940- 20:04.820* :  So this is very important for the EU.
*20:05.360- 20:07.980* :  But on the other hand, you know, it will be very challenging
*20:07.980- 20:11.600* :  to bring in a country that is currently at war.
*20:11.960- 20:16.040* :  You know, Ukraine is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
*20:16.480- 20:17.880* :  It's a wash with weapons.
*20:17.880- 20:24.540* :  And about 18% of its territory is currently controlled by Russia.
*20:25.140- 20:29.020* :  So in reality, yesterday a very strong political message
*20:29.020- 20:33.000* :  from the EU, but in reality, joining the European Union
*20:33.000- 20:37.680* :  is a very long and complicated process that could take about 10 years.
*20:38.160- 20:41.300* :  So it could take a long time before Ukraine
*20:41.460- 20:44.680* :  finally becomes a member of the European Union.
*20:45.100- 20:46.280* :  Sophia Batitsa reporting.
*20:47.100- 20:51.040* :  There's mysteries surrounding the health of a prominent Russian social media figure
*20:51.040- 20:55.440* :  who was conscripted into the army just days after his content was criticised
*20:55.440- 20:58.100* :  as pro-Ukrainian by the Russian authorities.
*20:58.840- 21:01.440* :  The TikTok star, Ivan Menayev, appeared to collapse
*21:01.440- 21:06.260* :  and lose consciousness on stage in the southern city of Stavroport.
*21:06.740- 21:09.980* :  A little earlier, he'd been handed a summons to join Russia's army.
*21:10.420- 21:14.400* :  Vitaly Shepchenko of BBC Monitoring tried to make sense of the story.
*21:14.820- 21:18.320* :  Ivan Menayev, who goes by the name of Holiday Boy, starts with an ex.
*21:18.480- 21:24.440* :  He was criticised by the head of a government-backed censorship body.
*21:24.440- 21:29.160* :  So it's here, the Katerina Mizulina said that he was pro-Ukrainian
*21:29.600- 21:32.660* :  and it's true that on social media,
*21:32.660- 21:37.920* :  Ivan Menayev described himself as a Ukrainian and he hails from Crimea,
*21:38.240- 21:40.240* :  which is a part of Ukraine annexed by Russia,
*21:40.300- 21:44.720* :  and he described the whole conflict between Russia and Ukraine as pointless.
*21:45.220- 21:50.440* :  So two weeks after that, a video emerged where he was handed a summons
*21:50.500- 21:53.320* :  to visit a military conscription office.
*21:53.500- 21:57.280* :  Two days ago on the 6th of November, another video emerged from his concert
*21:57.280- 22:00.660* :  where he stopped singing, dropped the microphone,
*22:01.120- 22:05.120* :  dropped his knees, collapsed on his back and had to be carried off stage.
*22:05.460- 22:09.120* :  And also importantly, some of his shows were cancelled.
*22:09.540- 22:13.240* :  Conscription in Russia, just give us a very brief picture if you can
*22:13.240- 22:17.920* :  of what the situation there is and what the feeling among particular young men is about it.
*22:18.260- 22:20.420* :  You would understand why he should be worried,
*22:20.420- 22:27.020* :  because reports emerge today that people who are being conscripted into the army
*22:27.540- 22:30.580* :  and are likely to be forced to fight in Ukraine,
*22:30.580- 22:37.040* :  they may have to keep on fighting there until the end of what's known as
*22:37.040- 22:39.280* :  the special military operation in Ukraine.
*22:39.280- 22:43.040* :  So indefinitely, and that's a terrifying prospect
*22:43.040- 22:47.360* :  because for many of them, chances of survival are pretty slim.
*22:48.060- 22:51.440* :  Let's go to the United States now where another member of Donald Trump's family
*22:51.460- 22:53.160* :  has been appearing in court.
*22:53.160- 22:57.440* :  Ivanka Trump, the former president's daughter and one time senior adviser,
*22:57.440- 23:01.180* :  is the latest of his children to give evidence in New York
*23:01.180- 23:04.640* :  at the civil trial over alleged fraud at their family company.
*23:04.760- 23:08.620* :  She isn't a defendant though, unlike her father and his two eldest sons.
*23:09.280- 23:13.080* :  Before Ms. Trump was in court, the prosecutor Latisha James had this to say.
*23:13.420- 23:19.300* :  Ms. Trump will do all that she can to try to separate herself from this corporation
*23:19.400- 23:22.200* :  but she's inextricably tied to the Trump organization
*23:22.720- 23:27.440* :  and to these properties that she helped secure financing for.
*23:28.040- 23:30.540* :  Well, for more, I spoke to our correspondents, Neta Tulfik,
*23:30.540- 23:34.480* :  who is outside the court. Ivanka Trump is not a defendant this time round
*23:34.480- 23:36.540* :  and I asked her why she in court then.
*23:37.000- 23:39.820* :  She was a defendant until an appeals court took her off,
*23:39.820- 23:42.940* :  saying the claims against her were just too old on the statute of limitations.
*23:42.960- 23:45.440* :  So she was a part of the original complaint.
*23:45.460- 23:49.880* :  As a witness, the judge thinks that she has these links that are important to explore.
*23:49.880- 23:53.600* :  And in particular, it's her involvement in negotiating
*23:53.600- 23:57.980* :  and securing financing with Deutsche Bank for properties including
*23:58.340- 24:00.220* :  Trump-Doral, Gulf Resort, and Miami,
*24:00.760- 24:03.000* :  and the old post office in Washington, D.C.
*24:03.000- 24:04.560* :  that became another Trump hotel.
*24:05.180- 24:09.180* :  And after her husband, Gerard Kushner introduced her to someone at Deutsche Bank,
*24:09.180- 24:13.440* :  she was able to get interest rates on loans very low
*24:14.020- 24:18.140* :  because they required a personal guarantee from Donald Trump and evidence
*24:18.140- 24:19.960* :  that he had a minimum net worth.
*24:20.340- 24:23.420* :  And so prosecutors say that Trump's statements of financial condition
*24:23.620- 24:25.280* :  were central to those loans.
*24:25.280- 24:29.620* :  And remember, those statements are what they said contained those fraudulent valuations.
*24:29.620- 24:33.280* :  And they say that those loans saved him hundreds of millions of dollars
*24:33.680- 24:37.300* :  and Ivanka knows exactly the kinds of conversations that went on with those banks.
*24:37.480- 24:40.860* :  So just give us an idea of what it was actually like in the court from what you've seen.
*24:40.860- 24:42.660* :  I mean, her father the other day was bombastic.
*24:42.660- 24:44.620* :  It was theatrical. He got told off by the judge.
*24:44.620- 24:45.560* :  What was it like with her?
*24:45.780- 24:47.460* :  Very different in terms of tone.
*24:47.640- 24:51.120* :  I mean, she is trying to come off as being, you know, very cooperative.
*24:51.120- 24:52.540* :  She's smiling brightly.
*24:52.540- 24:58.540* :  She's being extremely kind to the judge and the court answering questions in an even tone.
*24:58.540- 25:03.940* :  But what has been so striking is just how often she answers questions
*25:03.940- 25:05.500* :  with, I do not recall,
*25:05.880- 25:09.920* :  which as a high ranking executive when she is shown the evidence,
*25:09.920- 25:14.100* :  she will even go back and say each time she is asked, you know,
*25:14.100- 25:17.940* :  does this refresher recollection seeing the emails that you have with these banks?
*25:18.500- 25:20.520* :  And she continues to say, I do not recall.
*25:20.520- 25:25.900* :  So clearly, Ivanka Trump has decided that even though prosecutors have this evidence
*25:25.900- 25:30.700* :  and have been able to introduce it because she is a witness that she either doesn't really recall
*25:30.700- 25:34.120* :  or does not plan to give them any extra ammunition for their case.
*25:34.560- 25:36.100* :  Neutrophic in New York City.
*25:36.460- 25:40.760* :  Next, Bangladesh, the world's second biggest exporter of clothes
*25:40.760- 25:46.620* :  where violent protests over pay and conditions for thousands of mostly women workers are continuing.
*25:47.320- 25:51.200* :  One woman has been killed and several others injured Nidaka after clashes
*25:51.200- 25:54.440* :  between police and factory workers demanding better wages.
*25:55.060- 25:59.720* :  Crowds of workers returned to the streets today after rejecting a new pay increase
*25:59.720- 26:04.480* :  and police say they fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters
*26:05.000- 26:07.140* :  who were blocking roads and throwing stones.
*26:07.840- 26:10.840* :  Our South Asia Regional Editor, Ambra Sanatir Arjan,
*26:10.840- 26:13.520* :  has spent time with the workers over a number of years
*26:14.100- 26:16.220* :  and he told me about the conditions they are living in.
*26:16.660- 26:20.160* :  These women, they found the backbone of the government's industry in Bangladesh.
*26:20.540- 26:22.780* :  Its government industries are lifeline of the economy.
*26:22.780- 26:24.680* :  We are talking about four million people.
*26:24.680- 26:27.400* :  These are from rural areas of Bangladesh,
*26:27.480- 26:30.720* :  otherwise doing agriculture work or any manual labor.
*26:31.380- 26:34.880* :  So this has transformed the country in the last 30-35 years.
*26:35.600- 26:39.380* :  Now, when they come to places like Dhaka, they don't have housing.
*26:39.700- 26:43.820* :  So they have to go and stay in a slum or with shanti towns or tin roof houses.
*26:43.820- 26:47.660* :  There's no running water and then they have to work for like 10 to 12 hours.
*26:47.840- 26:49.660* :  They come back and cook for the families.
*26:49.660- 26:53.920* :  Again, get up early, cook in case if they have children, they have to go to school.
*26:54.440- 26:56.160* :  So life is not easy.
*26:56.160- 26:59.140* :  It's not just about the money, is it? It's also about working condition.
*26:59.140- 27:00.200* :  And what else do they want?
*27:00.220- 27:02.980* :  One is working conditions inside the factories.
*27:03.380- 27:06.260* :  Two safety. Many factories met with accidents.
*27:06.260- 27:08.960* :  They are fire accidents. Hundreds of workers have been killed.
*27:09.640- 27:11.960* :  And they want an increase in the salary three times.
*27:11.960- 27:15.440* :  Because in the last five years, the food prices have tripled.
*27:15.480- 27:19.260* :  That is why the workers are on the streets protesting outside Dhaka,
*27:19.780- 27:23.320* :  asking for this $205 minimum wage a month.
*27:23.760- 27:26.800* :  Is the government broadly receptive to what they want?
*27:26.840- 27:28.900* :  I've spoken to many of the government factory owners.
*27:28.900- 27:32.740* :  The first thing they will say is if the Western global fashion brands,
*27:32.740- 27:36.720* :  if they can offer more, even 10 cents, 15 cents per t-shirt,
*27:37.160- 27:38.740* :  then we can pass it on to the workers.
*27:38.740- 27:44.640* :  Now why orders are moving from China to Bangladesh is because of the low cost of labor.
*27:45.060- 27:49.860* :  For example, in China, the same work the worker might be getting about $350 a month.
*27:49.860- 27:53.560* :  Whereas now the Bangladeshi workers are talking about $75 to $80.
*27:53.560- 27:57.200* :  So campaign groups like Clean Clothes campaign from the Netherlands,
*27:57.200- 28:02.260* :  they would argue that in the name of what they call cheap fashion or the fast fashion.
*28:02.700- 28:05.100* :  People are buying clothes because they are very cheap.
*28:05.460- 28:08.580* :  If you go to Oxford Street, one of the busiest shopping areas in Europe,
*28:09.180- 28:12.640* :  you will find many fashion brands having clothes from made in Bangladesh.
*28:12.900- 28:14.720* :  And these are the women, they stitch these clothes.
*28:15.340- 28:19.160* :  You can buy a jeans down in Oxford Street for $6 or $10.
*28:19.860- 28:22.940* :  And that is the debate, whether even people in the West,
*28:23.120- 28:24.880* :  whether they should be paying more for the product,
*28:24.880- 28:28.780* :  and that will have an impact in the quality of life of the workers in Bangladesh.
*28:29.540- 28:31.480* :  Ambrassan Etirajan speaking to me.
*28:32.080- 28:36.040* :  The British insurance market, Lloyds of London, has said it is deeply sorry
*28:36.540- 28:42.400* :  after a report concluded it had played a significant role in the historic transatlantic slave trade.
*28:42.460- 28:47.620* :  Lloyds has announced a fund of more than $60 million to help affected communities
*28:48.180- 28:50.720* :  and boost black and minority ethnic recruitment.
*28:50.720- 28:52.880* :  His or business reporter Sam Gruett.
*28:53.380- 28:57.480* :  After protests wet the world in 2020 following the death of George Floyd,
*28:57.480- 29:00.780* :  an unarmed black man who died in police custody in the US,
*29:01.360- 29:04.200* :  pressure mounted on companies to address links to slavery,
*29:04.200- 29:05.880* :  and tackle racial inequality.
*29:06.580- 29:10.220* :  Lloyds of London apologized for its historical connections to the slave trade
*29:10.600- 29:12.200* :  and commissioned an independent report.
*29:12.960- 29:16.300* :  Around 12 to 15 million people were taken by force from Africa
*29:16.300- 29:20.780* :  to be used as slaves in the Caribbean, North, Central and South America
*29:21.200- 29:23.060* :  between the 15 and 1800s.
*29:23.440- 29:28.420* :  The report says Lloyds, established in 1688, played a significant role
*29:28.600- 29:30.940* :  in making the transatlantic slave trade possible.
*29:31.660- 29:35.900* :  The Lloyds chairman Bruce Carnegie Brown said he was committed to tackling inequalities,
*29:36.460- 29:40.320* :  promising to spend £40 million on helping communities who were impacted,
*29:40.860- 29:44.760* :  as well as £12 million on boosting black and minority ethnic recruitment.
*29:45.420- 29:49.240* :  The race, a quality think tank, the runnymy trust welcomed Lloyds' work
*29:49.240- 29:50.660* :  in acknowledging past mistakes.
*29:51.200- 29:54.900* :  But questioned its commitment, highlighting Lloyds' ethnicity pay gap,
*29:55.320- 29:57.820* :  which is 21.5% for black employees.
*29:58.700- 29:59.260* :  Sam Gruett.
*29:59.740- 30:03.360* :  Now, before we finish, a cracking story of Pet Rescue for you.
*30:03.700- 30:07.440* :  A dog in Britain has been held a hero after she sniffed out her owner's cat,
*30:07.440- 30:10.580* :  who was stuck 30 metres below ground in a mineshaft.
*30:11.080- 30:14.660* :  Mogli had been missing for six days when Daisy, the springer spaniel,
*30:14.660- 30:16.540* :  picked up his scent while out on a walk.
*30:17.040- 30:18.040* :  Jane Prendergast has more.
*30:18.620- 30:23.560* :  Mogli's owner, Michelle Rose, said she'd almost given up hope of finding him alive,
*30:23.560- 30:28.520* :  but then she saw her dog Daisy going berserk in some woods near their home.
*30:28.660- 30:32.280* :  She had her nose to the ground in a way I've not seen her do before,
*30:32.580- 30:35.740* :  and then shot up through the woods and then came back to find me.
*30:35.740- 30:38.220* :  She was persistent in making me follow her.
*30:38.440- 30:41.420* :  When Michelle called for Mogli, she heard him in the mineshaft.
