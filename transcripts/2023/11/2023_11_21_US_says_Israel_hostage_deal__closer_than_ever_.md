*00:56.260- 01:00.080* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*01:00.080- 01:06.940* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*01:06.940- 01:12.280* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*01:12.280- 01:18.460* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But controversially turned against the players
*01:18.980- 01:22.980* :  once his sneakers were off. So is he Good Bad or just another billionaire?
*01:23.240- 01:26.660* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*01:32.400- 01:35.200* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:37.400- 01:43.240* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on the 21st of November, these are our main stories.
*01:43.700- 01:48.600* :  A truce and a release of hostages seems to be getting closer in Israel's conflict with Gaza.
*01:49.320- 01:53.700* :  And events take place in Kiev to mark the 10th anniversary of the start of the uprising
*01:54.180- 01:57.120* :  that eventually toppled Ukraine's pro-Russian president.
*01:59.280- 02:00.200* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:04.900- 02:08.640* :  Are you okay? Says the rescuer. Don't worry. We're going to get you soon.
*02:09.560- 02:12.920* :  Later, the 300 year plan to end child marriage.
*02:12.940- 02:17.640* :  Their dreams, their opportunities and aspirations were cut off completely.
*02:17.640- 02:20.120* :  Any of us would be outraged at the thought.
*02:20.740- 02:22.160* :  Michelle Obama has some ideas.
*02:25.780- 02:31.620* :  The diplomatic signs are promising. President Biden says he believes a deal between Israel and Hamas
*02:31.620- 02:37.900* :  is near. Qatar is trying to mediate the deal which would lead to a truce and the release of some
*02:37.900- 02:44.380* :  of the 240 Israeli hostages Hamas still holds. The Katari foreign ministry spokesperson,
*02:44.380- 02:48.720* :  Majad Alansari, says negotiations have reached a critical and final stage.
*02:49.420- 02:52.620* :  So far, there's been no official word from the Israeli authorities.
*02:53.260- 02:57.200* :  Mark Lowen, our correspondent in Jerusalem, tell me more about the Israeli government's plans.
*02:57.800- 03:01.960* :  There are reports on the Israeli media, for example, Nick, that on Tuesday night,
*03:01.960- 03:07.440* :  the small war security cabinet will assemble, talking about the hostage deal.
*03:08.000- 03:12.700* :  And we understand that the entire cabinet would need to approve any sort of prisoner release
*03:13.200- 03:16.820* :  of Palestinians, which is why they are also being asked to be on standby.
*03:17.740- 03:21.480* :  So I think all the indications are that we are moving towards that point.
*03:21.480- 03:25.800* :  But as has frequently been said in all of this, that all maximum of nothing has agreed
*03:25.800- 03:31.780* :  until everything has agreed stands. It's extremely sensitive. Nobody wants to get the hopes of
*03:32.360- 03:37.880* :  families of the hostages up too high before the final issues are ironed out in all of this.
*03:38.100- 03:43.020* :  I mean, to what extent has the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu been forced into this by the
*03:43.020- 03:45.920* :  pressure being put on him by the relatives of these hostages?
*03:46.240- 03:50.460* :  I think that's a very good question. I mean, they are particularly frustrated. Many of them
*03:50.460- 03:55.300* :  with his handling of things. They suggest that he has been prioritizing the military operation
*03:55.300- 03:59.460* :  over the release of hostages, who have now been there for more than six weeks. There are
*03:59.460- 04:04.920* :  a few families who of the hostages who whose anger spilled over really on Monday night against
*04:04.920- 04:10.600* :  Benjamin Netanyahu. His line has always been, look, we have twin aims in all of this, the elimination
*04:10.600- 04:15.900* :  of Hamas and the return of the hostages. There are big question marks over whether the twin
*04:15.900- 04:21.560* :  aims have been compatible, but they've always wanted to prioritize the return of the hostages.
*04:21.560- 04:26.240* :  The question is whether the military operation and the idea of bombing Hamas to the negotiating
*04:26.240- 04:31.100* :  table has taken longer than it should have done. Mark, the United Nations Children's Fund has
*04:31.100- 04:36.280* :  warned of a tragic and entirely avoidable rise in the number of children dying in Gaza because
*04:36.280- 04:42.960* :  of a lack of water and fuel. What would a truce mean for the people living in the strip?
*04:43.800- 04:49.160* :  It would mean a humanitarian pause, a cessation of violence for a number of days, possibly
*04:49.160- 04:56.040* :  between three and five days. It could mean we understand 300 aid trucks being allowed into Gaza
*04:56.040- 05:02.880* :  delivering vital supplies of fuel and food and water, but there has been, we understand,
*05:02.880- 05:06.940* :  disagreement within the Israeli cabinet over the duration of that cessation of violence,
*05:07.600- 05:12.740* :  with some more on the far right of the cabinet wanting it to be shorter in time and in duration.
*05:13.440- 05:19.800* :  So the needs on the ground are so acute that actually even three or five days would only alleviate
*05:19.800- 05:25.620* :  to a small extent. As Israel says that it is preparing to extend the military operation
*05:25.660- 05:30.340* :  into the southern part of Gaza, the suffering in that area is going to only intensify,
*05:30.340- 05:34.600* :  and remember there are more than a million civilians who have fled into that area since the
*05:34.600- 05:39.360* :  since the military operations began. That was Mark Loin. Well, a few minutes before we recorded
*05:39.360- 05:44.660* :  this podcast, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said progress is being made on the return
*05:44.660- 05:50.680* :  of the hostages. I hope there will be good news or bring you more updates in our later editions
*05:50.680- 05:57.500* :  of the global news podcast. Indian rescue teams have had their first site of 41 construction
*05:57.500- 06:03.960* :  workers who've spent 10 days trapped in a collapsed road tunnel in the Himalayan foothills of northern
*06:03.960- 06:09.940* :  India. Rescue workers pushed a tiny camera through a pipe and then out of the glue a face appears
*06:09.940- 06:18.340* :  anxious but relieved of one of the trap men. Are you fine? Says one of the people at the rescue
*06:18.340- 06:26.800* :  centre. If you are, raise your hand and smile. Yes, we're fine. Says the trap man will reach you
*06:26.800- 06:32.620* :  shortly. Don't worry. Replies the rescuer. Well, the camera then pans around and reveals the men
*06:33.020- 06:38.640* :  wearing safety helmets and jackets standing around in the cutoff section of tunnel. A new pipe has
*06:38.640- 06:43.660* :  also made it possible to deliver the men's first hot meal since the collapse until now a smaller
*06:43.660- 06:49.500* :  pipe has supplied oxygen and dried food. Rescue workers are now drilling at five different
*06:49.500- 06:54.120* :  points to try to reach those trapped. Samira Hussein is our correspondent in Delhi.
*06:54.800- 06:59.220* :  They do look in good spirits and what we're hearing from officials on the ground is that most
*06:59.360- 07:03.360* :  of them have been saying that their health is pretty good. A few of them have been complaining
*07:03.360- 07:08.420* :  about dysentery but for several days now they've been providing them with vitamins and medicine
*07:09.280- 07:15.640* :  because of course keeping them healthy both physically and mentally is a big part of this rescue
*07:15.640- 07:21.940* :  operation. So what happens now? They've got these small pipes to give them access to oxygen and
*07:21.940- 07:30.620* :  some foods. So what's the next stage? So we are on a new rescue plan. The original plan and what
*07:30.620- 07:35.880* :  they have been doing since the accident happened is that officials were trying to tunnel through the
*07:35.880- 07:41.360* :  mouth of the tunnel and they were trying to drill a hole wide enough that they could insert
*07:41.360- 07:46.500* :  these metal pipes that the men could then crawl through to safety. But they've had to stop that
*07:46.500- 07:51.800* :  part of the operation for two reasons. One, they're drilling machines not once but twice have broken
*07:51.800- 07:58.040* :  down and another reason is they're actually hearing some cracking sounds which indicates that in
*07:58.040- 08:04.580* :  fact the ground is unstable. So they've redirected and now they're drilling five different tunnels
*08:05.040- 08:09.440* :  from different parts of the tunnel. So they're coming from the top, from the sides,
*08:09.440- 08:16.540* :  and from the front and the back to try and get to the workers. They've inserted a new sort of pipe
*08:16.540- 08:22.640* :  that they had been using. They've been using one pipe so far to offer food and water to the trapped
*08:22.680- 08:28.560* :  men. Now they have a second pipe going and that's the pipe through which we saw the first images
*08:28.900- 08:32.460* :  of the men. Sounds a very complex operation obviously they're trying to avoid
*08:33.080- 08:37.860* :  another collapse of the tunnel. Do people think the authorities are doing pretty good jobs so far?
*08:38.680- 08:44.920* :  Well there has been some anger by from the families and friends and co-workers of those
*08:44.920- 08:50.280* :  stuck inside the tunnel. There have been days where there have been angry skirmishes between
*08:50.280- 08:55.880* :  officials and those gathered at the mouth of the tunnel saying that look they're what is taking
*08:55.880- 09:01.220* :  so long? Why is it taking so long to rescue these men? And also why aren't we getting regular
*09:01.220- 09:08.320* :  updates? I think officials have heard some of that and are now giving officials or rather are
*09:08.540- 09:13.980* :  giving regular press briefings trying to keep the public and most importantly the family members
*09:13.980- 09:20.560* :  aware of what's happening on the ground. Samira Hussein, it is a staggeringly large roundup of
*09:20.560- 09:26.680* :  suspects. 31,000 people thought to have been involved in online and telephone scams have been
*09:26.680- 09:32.800* :  handed over to China from Myanmar. Criminals defraud Chinese people of hundreds of millions
*09:32.800- 09:37.560* :  of dollars a year. Mickey Bristol reports. This is a huge number of suspects
*09:38.200- 09:43.620* :  handed over because Beijing has renewed a campaign to target criminal gangs who defraud Chinese
*09:43.620- 09:49.240* :  citizens from just over the border in Myanmar fighting between ethnic groups and the Burmese army
*09:49.240- 09:56.140* :  in the area where the fraudsters operate also seems to have spurred these deportations. China said 63
*09:56.140- 10:02.600* :  of those handed over were gang-wing leaders but the culpability of the rest is unclear. The UN
*10:02.600- 10:07.880* :  says many people involved in online fraud are themselves coerced into criminal activity
*10:07.900- 10:15.660* :  and are victims too. Mickey Bristol, it's a poignant day in Ukraine. Ten years ago on Tuesday
*10:15.660- 10:21.000* :  protesters began to gather in Kyiv's independent square. It was the start of what became known as
*10:21.000- 10:26.680* :  the Euro-Maidan protests, an uprising which toppled Ukraine's then pro-Russian president.
*10:26.700- 10:31.300* :  The consequences are still playing out today. The collapse of the governments sparked the
*10:31.300- 10:36.600* :  Separatist war in the east of Ukraine and prompted Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
*10:37.440- 10:43.700* :  Attending a ceremony in Kyiv, the German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius reaffirmed Berlin's
*10:43.700- 10:44.500* :  support for Ukraine.
*10:48.180- 10:53.500* :  Courageous people of all ages took to the streets for freedom to protest and demonstrate for
*10:53.500- 10:59.040* :  reproachment with Europe and paid for it with their lives. And today for almost two years,
*10:59.940- 11:04.620* :  Ukraine and Ukrainians have been fighting for their freedom again in this case against an
*11:04.620- 11:09.540* :  outside attacker. Our correspondent James Warderhaus in Kyiv has been watching events unfold
*11:09.540- 11:15.180* :  there and reflects on the significance of the day. There's been a service, there's been some
*11:15.180- 11:19.320* :  hymns and it's been acknowledged that the numbers are lower this year because of the continued
*11:19.320- 11:24.740* :  full-scale invasion that Ukraine finds itself on the receiving end of. Ten years ago, there were
*11:24.740- 11:30.600* :  snipers in the hotel Ukraine which sits in front of me by independent square. They opened fire
*11:30.600- 11:35.320* :  on the protesters. But what would follow as you say was the toppling of Viktor Yanukovych,
*11:35.340- 11:41.600* :  the last pro-mosco president, as Ukraine politically decided to take matters into its own hands
*11:41.600- 11:47.300* :  and move towards the west. And President Zelensky said this war isn't a movie.
*11:47.600- 11:54.560* :  The story of its struggle is continuing, but Ukraine is by no means out of the woods, far from it.
*11:54.700- 12:02.320* :  It is still under attack, it is still occupied. There's certainly a poignant feel in the city,
*12:02.780- 12:07.640* :  but I think there have been a few welcome sites as well. We've seen your representatives from
*12:07.640- 12:12.460* :  the UK, Germany and the US all come with the same message that we are here for you
*12:13.140- 12:18.860* :  for as long as it takes, but Ukraine is embarking on yet another difficult winter campaign
*12:18.860- 12:25.140* :  on the front lines. James Warderhaus. Three of the world's most high-profile women have been in
*12:25.140- 12:31.140* :  Malawi to support grassroots organisations working to end child marriage. Michelle Obama,
*12:31.680- 12:36.000* :  Amal Clooney and Melinda French Gates say the challenge in Malawi is a very big one,
*12:36.000- 12:41.140* :  indeed 42% of girls in the country marry under the age of 18. And globally,
*12:41.140- 12:45.640* :  UN estimates suggest 12 million girls are forced into marriage every year.
*12:46.340- 12:51.300* :  Gender and identity reporter Megamone joined the group on their first visit to the country's
*12:51.300- 13:00.560* :  Machinga district. In central Malawi, a girls school opens their doors to some very high-profile
*13:00.560- 13:07.500* :  guests. Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney and Melinda French Gates have joined forces to tackle child
*13:07.500- 13:13.100* :  marriage. I sat down with the three women to ask why the issue of child marriage is important for
*13:13.100- 13:19.260* :  them. The former first lady of the US, Michelle Obama answered first. I see my daughters in those girls
*13:19.440- 13:26.680* :  and if we just put ourselves in those girls shoes and think of how would we feel if it were us
*13:26.700- 13:33.240* :  or our daughters that were married off at the age of 12 or 10 or however old and their dreams,
*13:33.240- 13:39.020* :  their opportunities and aspirations were cut off completely. Any of us would be outraged at the
*13:39.020- 13:47.060* :  thought. The barrister Amal Clooney outreach is one sustainable solution. She's supposing
*13:47.060- 13:54.060* :  women lawyers in Malawi to physically travel to mudsies or villages. We formed a network of mobile
*13:54.060- 13:59.480* :  legal aid clinics which means literally there's a van that goes out with lawyers and we go out in
*13:59.480- 14:05.260* :  a community and say to girls you know these are your rights and if you need a lawyer for free to
*14:05.260- 14:10.300* :  protect you that's what we are here to provide. One of the things that we see in Malawi is it's not
*14:10.300- 14:16.280* :  so much about changing the law on paper because actually Malawi's laws are fairly progressive when
*14:16.280- 14:21.760* :  it comes to girls' rights but it's about access to justice giving people access to the courts
*14:21.780- 14:26.140* :  and this is what we do is fight for girls' rights in the courtroom that's going to be a big piece
*14:26.140- 14:30.460* :  but we're also not naive enough to think that that's the only piece. The large-scale international
*14:30.460- 14:36.060* :  organisations that we have that are supposed to be dealing with this like the UN Security Council
*14:36.060- 14:41.440* :  like powerful governments are not delivering and so I think philanthropy then and individual
*14:41.440- 14:47.380* :  lawyers can play and have to play a large role with the determination that it takes to win a war.
*14:47.700- 14:52.800* :  I asked Philanthropist Melinda French Gates if she'd chosen an impossible problem to look into.
*14:53.040- 14:59.980* :  This is a solvable problem. The rates are coming down when real work gets done it's it's really a
*14:59.980- 15:05.820* :  social norm problem it's that first of all if you're a family that's in poverty and so let's say
*15:05.820- 15:11.200* :  you are scraping by and you don't have food in the house why do they think about selling the
*15:11.200- 15:17.300* :  girl child why aren't they thinking about selling the boy their valuing their sons is the truth
*15:17.900- 15:25.340* :  more than their daughters the only way to change social norms is at the community level you get
*15:25.340- 15:32.920* :  the community thinking differently about the girls. Back in Lutzie School in central Malawi
*15:33.140- 15:37.660* :  Michelle Obama sits down at a table with a group of girls listening to their stories.
*15:37.660- 15:42.780* :  There are so many girls like all of us all over the world that are going to be a lot of people
*15:42.780- 15:47.920* :  listening to this saying this is not my problem child marriage is nothing to do with me it's not in
*15:47.920- 15:54.440* :  my community what would you like to say to those people. Disinvestment and women and girls is all
*15:54.440- 16:01.840* :  of our issue the United States we're dealing with a rollback in reproductive rights things that people
*16:01.840- 16:08.460* :  thought they could take for granted and it's been a shock and a lot of it is because of the
*16:08.460- 16:16.060* :  devaluation of women the the belief that women don't have choice and power over their own being
*16:16.680- 16:24.140* :  that's what's happening here it's the same mentality it's the same carelessness the same selfishness
*16:24.140- 16:32.560* :  that exists everywhere that report was by mega moan still to come on the global news podcast
*16:32.580- 16:37.900* :  the elusive artist Banksy I just think it's my right to go out and paint it equally somebody
*16:37.900- 16:41.720* :  asks to go out and paint over it if they don't like it it's about a future they'll sit you like a
*16:41.720- 16:46.820* :  big playground you know and you just let them mess about in you know revealed in a long lost BBC
*16:50.440- 16:57.200* :  at least 130 people have died in Ethiopia Kenya and Somalia following heavy rains Somalia has
*16:57.200- 17:01.740* :  already declared a state of emergency because more than half a million people are displaced from
*17:01.740- 17:07.260* :  their homes the Ravel has been described by the UN as a once in a century event and is predicted
*17:07.260- 17:14.720* :  to continue until December my colleague Davina Gupta has been speaking to Alvin Muñacia from the horn
*17:14.720- 17:21.840* :  and east africa regional office of emergency aid charity action against hunger the situation in
*17:21.840- 17:30.280* :  the Hanoverfeita is dire with downforce that's called the huge parts of Ethiopia Kenya Tanzania and
*17:30.540- 17:37.140* :  Somalia and the phenomenon is also likely lead to lead to flash floods landslides and martslides
*17:37.140- 17:43.880* :  destroying homes hospitals and crop fields are like we also expect that it will damage key
*17:43.880- 17:51.720* :  infrastructure as roads and bridges families in Somalia where we work recently suffered
*17:52.340- 17:58.000* :  through a prolonged and severe drought and they already had limited access to food income
*17:58.000- 18:04.400* :  and other resources to survive before the floods now the floods have made health services schools
*18:04.400- 18:10.960* :  and markets difficult to reach for our interventions and we have also seen that agricultural lands
*18:10.960- 18:18.180* :  that had dried out in years without rain washed away easily with the rain people have nothing
*18:18.180- 18:26.740* :  left for themselves so far we have already seen 29 deaths and this has also impacted 1.1 million
*18:26.740- 18:33.560* :  people displacing more than 300 and 34,000 from their homes it seems that the situation is getting
*18:33.560- 18:40.700* :  worse but the prediction is that the rainfall will continue until December so what's being
*18:40.700- 18:47.280* :  done to ensure that aid is reaching and people are also being moved to safer areas what we are
*18:47.280- 18:55.080* :  doing as part of our emergency response is to begin to be contaminated the water points
*18:55.620- 19:01.320* :  providing water treatment tablets and distributing hygiene supplies while at the same time
*19:01.320- 19:07.500* :  educating people on the importance of good hygiene practices to prevent disease outbreaks in the
*19:07.500- 19:13.660* :  community we aim to scale up our work to help families hit hard by the floods and we urge
*19:14.980- 19:21.640* :  our donors and governments to step up support for affected communities so that we can continue
*19:22.680- 19:29.300* :  rebuilding latrines and providing color approving kits in hotspots as well as distributing
*19:29.300- 19:36.740* :  mattresses and mosquitonets and taps into serving temporary shelters for families displaced by
*19:38.140- 19:43.500* :  Alvin Maunyassia of emergency aid charity action against hunger speaking to Devina Gupta.
*19:44.960- 19:49.760* :  According to the World Bank there is an estimated 500 million people suffering from period
*19:49.760- 19:55.800* :  poverty as women and girls who can't get access to basic products and facilities to deal with
*19:55.800- 20:01.900* :  menstruation but one Ella Lambert from the UK decided to do something to tackle the problem
*20:02.480- 20:07.100* :  and what started as a project during the Covid lockdown has now turned into a global charity
*20:07.100- 20:13.360* :  helping thousands of women. Sam Everett reports. So these are our reusable sanitary pads they last
*20:13.360- 20:18.700* :  three to five years you can wash them. Ella Lambert was stuck at home in Essex in the east of
*20:18.700- 20:24.400* :  England during lockdown with a lot of spare time on her hands. Having suffered bad period pains
*20:24.400- 20:29.760* :  herself she was interested in one issue in particular. I heard about period poverty for the first
*20:29.760- 20:34.460* :  time and thought I can do something about this so I borrowed a sewing machine from a friend I
*20:34.460- 20:39.240* :  learnt how to sew on YouTube and then I just started making pads and even now to this day I can't
*20:39.240- 20:45.800* :  sew anything else only pads. Three years later she's built a team of thousands of volunteers who
*20:45.800- 20:50.800* :  have sewn more than 100,000 brightly coloured reusable period pads which have then been given a
*20:50.800- 20:58.300* :  way to women around the world. Now Ella is visiting refugee camps in Lebanon. It's one of the main
*20:58.300- 21:03.640* :  places her charity the patch and my project works in. You have people living in refugee settlements
*21:03.760- 21:08.520* :  who don't have the products they need so they can't leave their tent when they're on their period
*21:08.640- 21:13.840* :  then maybe leak through their clothes and because the stigma is so strong they don't know who to ask
*21:13.840- 21:17.960* :  and they don't know how to ask because they're so scared of talking about periods in the first place.
*21:18.580- 21:27.280* :  Sana is a Syrian refugee in Lebanon who now uses Ella's pads. One time I got my period whilst
*21:27.320- 21:31.980* :  at work and I didn't have any money to buy pads so I had to tie a jumper around my waist until I
*21:31.980- 21:38.480* :  got back home. Today there's always a reusable pad in my back. Ella's charity has partnered
*21:38.480- 21:43.920* :  with various organisations and women centres to help distribute the reusable pads across the country.
*21:44.540- 21:49.160* :  Hamda is a mum of two girls and she struggled to afford sanitary products during the economic
*21:49.160- 21:56.460* :  crisis affecting the country. The cost of living is very high in Lebanon. The situation is
*21:56.580- 22:01.480* :  dire. I reached a time during this crisis when I had to cut up warm clothes to use them as
*22:01.480- 22:06.000* :  sanitary pads and provide pads for the girls. We tried using other methods but they called bad
*22:06.000- 22:10.880* :  side effects allergies. We found these were a better option. So do you want to go to use some pretty
*22:10.880- 22:16.080* :  cotton anyone you like? While she's in Lebanon Ella's also been teaching some local skilled children
*22:16.080- 22:21.400* :  in Beirut how to make the pads. The plan is that they can then join her army of volunteers and
*22:21.400- 22:26.500* :  then pass on the skills to others. Now we're having a workshop with Miss Ella so we can give this
*22:26.720- 22:32.040* :  skill to the women in the target community so that they're able to also make these pads and
*22:32.040- 22:35.740* :  use them for themselves and maybe we're able to sell them in little communities to make some
*22:35.740- 22:42.260* :  income and some money. As well as helping out vulnerable women in the region these girls are
*22:42.260- 22:47.100* :  keen to challenge the taboos surrounding periods. We're using these pretty cotton to
*22:47.100- 22:51.980* :  distinguish the period poverty issue in Lebanon. At the end of the day they're all right and
*22:52.060- 22:57.300* :  they shouldn't be a luxury for these young girls and I want to be ashamed of speaking about their
*22:57.300- 23:04.420* :  period. That report was by Sam Everett. As we record the Palestinian football team is playing
*23:04.420- 23:09.880* :  Australia in Kuwait in a game that what's going to be held in the West Bank but was relocated
*23:09.880- 23:14.720* :  after the start of the war in Gaza. Three of the Palestinian teams players were unable to
*23:14.720- 23:20.000* :  join the training ahead of the World Cup qualifier because they're stuck in Gaza. Players on
*23:20.000- 23:25.600* :  Australia's national football team will donate a portion of their match fees towards humanitarian
*23:25.600- 23:36.720* :  causes in Gaza. Yogi Te Limai reports from Ramallah. Ibrahim Abu Amirah kicks a ball around with a
*23:36.720- 23:43.640* :  child on the streets of Rafa in southern Gaza. Trapped in the strip he's displaced along with
*23:43.640- 23:49.980* :  hundreds of thousands of others and under the constant threat of bombardment. Ibrahim should have
*23:49.980- 23:55.500* :  been on a football pitch singing the Palestinian national anthem as he's done many times before.
*23:56.060- 24:01.360* :  He's one of the players who would have been trying out for the Palestinian team for the World Cup
*24:01.360- 24:10.260* :  qualifier matches. Instead he picks through the rubble of his home and airstrike hit the house
*24:10.260- 24:19.980* :  adjoining his killing 17 of his neighbors. We found only one of the bodies intact. We haven't
*24:19.980- 24:24.940* :  been able to dig out two bodies. They're still under the rubble. My grandparents, uncle and cousin
*24:24.940- 24:34.260* :  were injured. We're all living under threat of being killed. Amid the grief of war there's also the
*24:34.260- 24:40.320* :  heartache of losing out on the opportunity of a lifetime in a sport where careers usually have
*24:40.320- 24:46.620* :  a short span. Ibrahim has been described as one of the stars of the Palestinian defence by his team.
*24:50.640- 24:56.000* :  I haven't played for 44 days. Each day gets harder than the previous one and I'm constantly
*24:56.000- 25:05.120* :  scared for my life. One of the people who's trained Ibrahim is Ahab Abu-Jazar who used to be a
*25:05.120- 25:11.880* :  player himself. Now he's a trainer for the Palestinian football team. He's currently based in the West
*25:11.940- 25:22.740* :  Bank so we went to Ramallah to meet him. Mr. Abu-Jazar is from Gaza too and his family is also stuck
*25:22.740- 25:30.300* :  there. My father passed away from an illness on the second day of the war. Sadly I couldn't travel
*25:30.300- 25:36.480* :  to Gaza to bid him farewell because of the conflict. Danger is ever present in Gaza and my family
*25:36.480- 25:42.280* :  are constantly moving to find safer places to take shelter. Thousands of people have been killed in
*25:42.280- 25:48.720* :  Gaza amidst these circumstances. Why is it important that the Palestinian team play football?
*25:49.360- 25:56.760* :  Football is not just a game for us. It is a method through which we strive for our independence.
*25:56.780- 26:03.520* :  It's a symbol of our resistance and our aspiration to achieve an officially recognized state for every
*26:03.520- 26:15.580* :  Palestinian. Over the phone we spoke to another Palestinian football player Ahmed Kulab in Gaza.
*26:15.660- 26:24.280* :  He had a similar message. I believe that being a football player has become more than just a
*26:24.280- 26:29.840* :  game. Through football we can tell the entire world about the lives lost and those imprisoned.
*26:30.960- 26:35.520* :  It's a powerful way to demonstrate that the Palestinian people despite the challenges they
*26:35.520- 26:42.580* :  face are human beings. They have ambitions, dreams and talents. Yogi Te Limai was reporting
*26:42.580- 26:46.920* :  there and parts of her report were recorded by Amro Talabash in Gaza.
*26:48.500- 26:53.180* :  The BBC has unearthed what's believed to be one of the first face-to-face interviews with the
*26:53.180- 26:58.620* :  graffiti artist Banksy. Banksy has famously managed to keep his identity secret from the public for
*26:58.620- 27:05.220* :  decades, doing his street art anonymously and often under cover of darkness. His stencil motifs
*27:05.220- 27:10.760* :  of a girl with a heart-shaped red balloon or a marked protester throwing a bunch of flowers
*27:11.340- 27:15.460* :  have helped making one of the most famous artists in the world. Here's a bit of that interview
*27:15.460- 27:21.780* :  which was conducted in 2003. I think I could reaction, I think of most people from my work. I've
*27:21.780- 27:26.620* :  even had policemen in the past so they kind of like things about it. Yeah, I just think it's my
*27:26.620- 27:30.480* :  right to go out and paint it. Equally somebody else is right to go out and paint over it if they
*27:30.480- 27:34.520* :  don't like it. It doesn't actually take very long with a bucket of white paint to paint other
*27:34.560- 27:39.240* :  things. It's better if you treat the city like a big playground and you just start to mess about
*27:39.740- 27:43.860* :  and you know. Well, the interview will be heard in full for the first time in a special episode
*27:43.860- 27:50.120* :  of BBC Radio podcast The Banksy Story. The presenter James Peek told me how he'd got hold of
*27:50.120- 27:58.080* :  the full interview. After the Banksy Story dropped in July, I was besieged by many, many people with
*27:58.260- 28:05.180* :  interesting stories about Banksy and I had of all of them was a chap called Nigel Wrench who was a
*28:05.180- 28:10.160* :  cultural correspondent. He felt I've ever said, hey, I've got in a cupboard under my bed a mini
*28:10.160- 28:16.400* :  desk with a Banksy interview that's never been heard before from his first ever London show.
*28:16.680- 28:22.420* :  Are you interested in hearing it? I mean, obviously I was. 20 years ago, Banksy was getting going
*28:22.420- 28:28.280* :  but he wasn't a kind of global superstar. Nigel Twigged, this guy's going places, this is super
*28:28.280- 28:33.620* :  interesting. I'm going to keep it. No, he heard in that clip. He was an iconoclast 20 years ago
*28:33.620- 28:40.820* :  breaking conventions. We can hear a little bit more about what made him tick 20 years ago
*28:40.820- 28:45.300* :  in this clip as well. What are you wanting to say? What's turf war about? It's a celebration of
*28:45.320- 28:50.220* :  vandalism, I suppose. Most people think vandalism is a full air word, I think, but I think it's the
*28:50.220- 28:53.940* :  most efficient way of making art, if you do it properly. You know, if you put a coin on top of a
*28:53.940- 28:57.980* :  statue, then you make a sculpture and it didn't take you very long. I don't know, maybe you make a
*28:57.980- 29:02.820* :  lot more people look at that sculpture than ever looked at it before. Vandalism, vandalism as art?
*29:03.680- 29:09.440* :  Yeah, I think so. I wasn't even a real question. You know, I'm not here to apologise for it.
*29:09.640- 29:14.440* :  It's a quicker way of making your point. In the same way, my mother used to cook Sunday roast every
*29:14.440- 29:18.960* :  Sunday and say every Sunday. It takes hours to make it a minute's to eat and these days she
*29:19.360- 29:24.320* :  eats microwave meals for one and seems a lot happier. I'm kind of taking that approach to art,
*29:24.320- 29:29.340* :  really. I want to get it done and dusted. The goal of aim really is for it to show you less time
*29:29.340- 29:35.100* :  to make it than it takes people to look at it. As playful as ever, isn't it? Yeah. Redefining art,
*29:35.560- 29:44.280* :  from your listeners, do you think he has the same cachet, the same excitement 20 years on?
*29:44.580- 29:49.760* :  I think it's heightened. People understand his value and he's now in a position where he can make
*29:49.760- 29:55.100* :  your town a tourist destination simply by turning up at three o'clock in the morning and drawing
*29:55.100- 30:00.320* :  something on the wall. James Peak. Now, if you look up to the stars, you might notice something
*30:00.320- 30:06.080* :  unusual in the sky. It's a toolbox currently orbiting the earth after astronauts accidentally
*30:06.080- 30:10.380* :  dropped it whilst they were carrying out their work. A camera on board, the International Space
*30:10.380- 30:15.800* :  Station caught the moment the white bag spins out of frame past the astronauts who seemed
*30:15.800- 30:21.980* :  blissfully unaware. Jasmine Morgbelle and Laurel O'Hara were both on their first spacewalk,
*30:22.500- 30:27.440* :  making repairs on parts that allow the ISS to track the sun. And much like if you suddenly
*30:27.440- 30:32.640* :  realize you've left your house without your keys, the astronaut cannot find the bag where she thought
*30:32.640- 30:37.640* :  she last left it. And, Joseph, I think you're kind of one block zenith from where your bag is.
*30:37.680- 30:43.920* :  If you go back towards space one to 3681 and 3802, you should find your crewlock bag.
*30:44.320- 30:48.740* :  And I'm back at 3681. Okay, Kathy, you're at 3681.
*30:50.600- 30:56.120* :  Did you not see my bag? Okay, we Kathy. But this isn't rocket science.
*30:56.780- 31:02.140* :  Meanwhile, Jasmine Morgbelle is heading back to the airlock. She'll retrieve a new crewlock bag
*31:02.140- 31:08.180* :  essentially a tool bag. The next big task for these crew members is to start work on the RFG.
*31:09.160- 31:13.260* :  Another bag was right around the corner. So where's the missing one? And is it a danger to
*31:13.260- 31:19.520* :  satellites? David Reed from University of Bristol School of Civil Aerospace and Design Engineering
*31:19.520- 31:27.220* :  explains. Because it's white and it will reflect the light of the sun, it's not very bright,
*31:27.220- 31:35.600* :  it's about as bright as Uranus still will be visible. So the trajectory of the bag has been
*31:35.600- 31:41.200* :  analysed and the risk of it re-contacting the station has been decided is very low.
*31:41.560- 31:46.640* :  And that the crew and the station were safe. Obviously that doesn't affect, so that doesn't
*31:46.640- 31:53.360* :  think I count for other satellites. But because it's being tracked, warnings can be issued to
*31:53.760- 31:59.520* :  other satellite operators and they can perform like a maneuver to turn out the way basically.
*32:00.400- 32:04.840* :  Apparently it will remain in orbit for a few months before meeting its doom in a fiery
*32:04.840- 32:10.340* :  inferno as it plunges towards the Earth's atmosphere. So there you have it, a lost tool bag coming
*32:10.340- 32:17.100* :  to an end near you as experts predict in March 2024. And that's all from us for now but there will
*32:17.100- 32:21.560* :  be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on. If you want a comment on this podcast or
*32:21.560- 32:27.520* :  the topics covered in it, you can send us an email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.

*32:34.160- 32:39.960* :  by Chris Murphy and the producer was Misha Patel. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Miles and
*32:39.960- 32:41.120* :  until next time, goodbye.
*32:49.460- 32:53.780* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zing Sing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*32:54.040- 32:57.860* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*32:58.260- 33:03.660* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost a hundred million dollars
*33:04.000- 33:07.420* :  playing basketball. But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court.
*33:07.420- 33:13.500* :  His air Jordan range is worth billions. And he made his real money as an NBA team owner,
*33:13.880- 33:17.880* :  but controversially turned against the players once his sneakers were off.
*33:18.020- 33:23.080* :  So is he good, bad, or just another billionaire? To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire
*33:23.240- 33:24.460* :  wherever you get your podcasts.
