*01:32.260- 01:34.420* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT
*01:34.420- 01:37.300* :  on Wednesday 8th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:37.880- 01:40.480* :  Thousands more Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City
*01:40.480- 01:43.040* :  as Israeli military says it's reached the center
*01:43.040- 01:45.040* :  and is destroying Hamas tunnels.
*01:45.780- 01:48.020* :  The US Secretary of State has called for the Palestinian
*01:48.020- 01:51.240* :  authority to govern both Gaza and the West Bank
*01:51.240- 01:53.200* :  once the current conflict has ended.
*01:54.100- 01:56.720* :  Scientists say this year looks set to be the hottest
*01:56.900- 01:57.480* :  on record.
*02:00.660- 02:01.540* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:01.540- 02:04.140* :  I was standing for almost 47 hours,
*02:04.140- 02:05.200* :  hand-meeting bread.
*02:05.520- 02:07.060* :  That took a hell of a physical tool.
*02:07.200- 02:09.140* :  And I blistered on my hands by the end of it.
*02:09.400- 02:14.240* :  The chef who cooked nonstop for five days and five nights
*02:14.820- 02:16.080* :  will tell you why shortly.
*02:20.340- 02:23.020* :  Israel has said it's tightening a strangle hold
*02:23.120- 02:24.820* :  around Hamas in Gaza City,
*02:24.820- 02:27.380* :  with its troops now in the heart of the city
*02:27.380- 02:30.300* :  destroying the entrances to some of the vast network
*02:30.300- 02:32.440* :  of tunnels used by the group.
*02:33.020- 02:35.700* :  Civilians waving white flags have been fleeing
*02:35.700- 02:38.480* :  the most intense bombardments in northern Gaza.
*02:39.100- 02:41.720* :  But with a densely populated territory sealed off
*02:41.720- 02:45.380* :  and Israel also carrying out strikes on targets in the South,
*02:45.980- 02:47.060* :  nowhere is safe.
*02:47.300- 02:48.640* :  Hospitals are overwhelmed.
*02:48.640- 02:52.100* :  Entire neighborhoods destroyed and whole families
*02:52.100- 02:53.240* :  have been wiped out.
*02:53.880- 02:56.080* :  Varice Al-Jawad is from the aid organization
*02:56.080- 02:58.960* :  doctors without borders or MSF injuries them.
*02:59.480- 03:02.440* :  And he told us about conditions in the Al-Shifa hospital
*03:02.700- 03:03.480* :  in Gaza City.
*03:04.540- 03:07.680* :  Doctors and surgeons are talking about having to treat
*03:07.680- 03:08.900* :  patients on the operation,
*03:08.960- 03:11.540* :  to floor, to weave it in and out of bodies
*03:11.540- 03:13.660* :  as they navigate the hospital.
*03:14.060- 03:17.220* :  There are up to potentially 80,000 people taking shelter there.
*03:17.220- 03:19.460* :  The hygiene situation is horrific.
*03:19.540- 03:21.220* :  There's no water.
*03:21.860- 03:23.180* :  We've been warning about this.
*03:23.540- 03:24.500* :  No where is safe.
*03:24.840- 03:25.920* :  Ambulances have been hit.
*03:26.280- 03:27.300* :  Hospitals have been hit.
*03:27.680- 03:28.520* :  Schools have been hit.
*03:28.960- 03:30.100* :  Universities have been hit.
*03:30.640- 03:31.420* :  Roads have been hit.
*03:31.840- 03:34.800* :  Children are dying every minute, every 10 minutes.
*03:35.560- 03:37.500* :  I don't think anybody here can understand it.
*03:37.800- 03:39.560* :  Any kind of explanation or justification
*03:39.560- 03:40.940* :  for what's happening now in Gaza.
*03:41.860- 03:44.960* :  The Hamas run health authorities say more than 10 and a half
*03:44.960- 03:47.580* :  thousand people have died in Gaza.
*03:48.000- 03:51.700* :  The Hamas attacks a month ago killed 1,400 people in Israel.
*03:52.240- 03:53.680* :  We've got this update a short time ago
*03:53.680- 03:56.120* :  from our correspondent in southern Israel, Mark Lohan.
*03:56.940- 04:00.400* :  The Israeli troops are known to be to have encircled Gaza City
*04:00.840- 04:02.580* :  to basically have tried to cut it off.
*04:02.700- 04:06.140* :  And now we think that there are individual
*04:06.580- 04:09.060* :  specific raids happening inside Gaza City
*04:09.060- 04:11.600* :  with the Israeli Prime Minister saying that
*04:12.040- 04:13.780* :  Israel's forces are acting within the city.
*04:13.780- 04:16.300* :  Now we think that these are sort of targeted raids
*04:16.300- 04:18.480* :  as opposed to sort of a mass attack,
*04:19.100- 04:21.140* :  principally because, of course, Hamas has barricaded
*04:21.140- 04:22.200* :  itself within the city.
*04:22.680- 04:25.840* :  It is the belief that that is where the command centers are.
*04:26.620- 04:29.980* :  So the aim appears to be not necessarily kind of
*04:30.260- 04:31.880* :  street-to-street fighting across the whole city,
*04:31.880- 04:34.220* :  but to clear pockets of territory
*04:34.220- 04:36.560* :  and then control those pockets of territory
*04:36.560- 04:39.340* :  before they try to take control of the city itself.
*04:39.620- 04:42.220* :  The problem is, of course, for complicating the task
*04:42.220- 04:43.660* :  even further for the Israeli military
*04:44.080- 04:45.320* :  is the number of civilians, of course,
*04:45.320- 04:46.920* :  that are still inside Gaza City.
*04:47.240- 04:49.120* :  Tens of thousands, essentially, even hundreds of thousands
*04:49.120- 04:52.700* :  that will make any attack on Gaza City even more difficult.
*04:53.080- 04:55.160* :  Because Israel has been calling on these civilians
*04:55.180- 04:58.340* :  in northern Gaza, including in Gaza City, to move south,
*04:58.420- 05:00.640* :  but a lot of them are saying we can't
*05:00.640- 05:02.960* :  because it's a crowded territory in any way.
*05:02.960- 05:05.500* :  It's dangerous in the south because of Israeli attacks
*05:05.500- 05:07.240* :  there, including one on a refugee camp.
*05:07.580- 05:09.200* :  To give you an idea of the numbers, for example,
*05:09.200- 05:12.340* :  over the weekend, the UN said only 2,000 civilians
*05:12.340- 05:14.040* :  had moved south along that main
*05:14.040- 05:16.300* :  gas and highway from north to south.
*05:16.300- 05:19.600* :  While it is still estimated, there are some 350,000
*05:19.620- 05:22.400* :  who are still in the north, so it's just a drop in the ocean
*05:22.400- 05:23.740* :  in terms of the numbers moving south.
*05:23.740- 05:26.560* :  And the civilians are moving, but in small numbers.
*05:26.860- 05:30.980* :  And Israel is continuing to reject calls for humanitarian pauses
*05:30.980- 05:33.560* :  in the fighting, despite increasingly strong language
*05:33.560- 05:38.020* :  from agent agencies, one of which was talking about 160 children
*05:38.020- 05:39.840* :  in Gaza dying every day.
*05:40.540- 05:41.960* :  Yeah, the World Health Organization says
*05:41.960- 05:45.200* :  on average, 160 children there are dying every day
*05:45.200- 05:47.040* :  and they say that 16 medics have died,
*05:47.040- 05:50.220* :  or health care workers have died since the conflict began.
*05:51.020- 05:53.420* :  Benjamin Netanyahu had been quite firm in his rejection
*05:53.460- 05:57.200* :  of humanitarian pauses, these short localized pauses
*05:57.200- 05:59.280* :  in the fighting, saying that there would be no pauses
*05:59.280- 06:02.200* :  until there was progress on the Israeli hostages
*06:02.840- 06:05.820* :  more than 240 of whom remain under Hamas captivity.
*06:05.820- 06:08.480* :  But now he has said that they will look at tactical
*06:08.480- 06:10.320* :  little pauses in his words.
*06:10.940- 06:14.520* :  So that raises the possibility of localised stoppages
*06:14.520- 06:16.120* :  in the fighting for more aid to get in,
*06:16.440- 06:18.880* :  but still no formal announcement on that at the moment.
*06:19.840- 06:22.120* :  Mark Lohan, as international concern grows
*06:22.120- 06:24.020* :  about the fighting in Gaza, foreign ministers
*06:24.020- 06:26.620* :  from the G7 group of nations have expressed support
*06:26.620- 06:29.460* :  for humanitarian pauses and the establishment
*06:29.460- 06:31.000* :  of humanitarian corridors.
*06:31.640- 06:33.720* :  Speaking after the meeting, the US Secretary of State,
*06:33.760- 06:37.040* :  Anthony Blinken, outlined what he thought the conditions
*06:37.040- 06:39.720* :  should be for a durable peace in Gaza
*06:40.260- 06:41.620* :  once the fighting ends.
*06:42.560- 06:45.080* :  The only way to ensure that this crisis never happens again
*06:45.620- 06:47.020* :  is to begin setting the conditions
*06:47.020- 06:48.340* :  for durable peace and security.
*06:48.620- 06:51.080* :  The United States believes key elements should include
*06:51.640- 06:54.860* :  no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,
*06:55.160- 06:57.180* :  no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism,
*06:57.620- 07:00.160* :  no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends,
*07:00.460- 07:02.640* :  no attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza,
*07:03.240- 07:05.360* :  no reduction in the territory of Gaza.
*07:05.640- 07:07.920* :  We must also work on the affirmative elements
*07:07.920- 07:09.500* :  to get to a sustained peace.
*07:09.800- 07:11.700* :  These must include the Palestinian people's voices
*07:11.700- 07:14.720* :  and aspirations at the center of post-crisis governance
*07:14.720- 07:15.180* :  in Gaza.
*07:15.660- 07:17.360* :  It must include Palestinian-led governance
*07:17.360- 07:19.340* :  and Gaza unified with the West Bank
*07:19.800- 07:20.920* :  under the Palestinian Authority.
*07:21.880- 07:23.460* :  Our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson,
*07:23.460- 07:26.400* :  gave his assessment of the US Secretary of State's comments.
*07:27.460- 07:30.040* :  One of the big things that Mr Blinken mentioned there was
*07:30.700- 07:34.700* :  no reoccupation of Gaza, and it is really the truth,
*07:34.700- 07:38.040* :  should pull out, at least after a transitional period,
*07:38.040- 07:38.940* :  which he made clear.
*07:39.520- 07:43.400* :  Now, of course, Israel doesn't really want to occupy Gaza.
*07:43.400- 07:46.700* :  It pulled out of Gaza in 2005 after decades there.
*07:47.160- 07:49.900* :  It's hugely expensive, hugely dangerous,
*07:50.480- 07:52.400* :  trying to maintain things there.
*07:52.760- 07:54.700* :  And so I think they've no wish to do that.
*07:55.720- 07:57.460* :  Mr Netanyahu, the Prime Minister,
*07:57.460- 08:00.620* :  said that Israel would oversee security
*08:00.680- 08:02.440* :  for an indefinite period.
*08:02.440- 08:05.100* :  He's already said that, but he didn't specify whether this
*08:05.100- 08:07.780* :  would be from the outside or the inside.
*08:08.360- 08:11.100* :  Although, Mr Blinken has made clear that there should be
*08:11.100- 08:14.120* :  no blockade, no continuation of the blockade,
*08:14.120- 08:16.800* :  which has been running since the Israeli pullout.
*08:17.240- 08:19.100* :  So that would then make things difficult
*08:19.100- 08:22.120* :  for Israel to really oversee security, one would have thought.
*08:22.920- 08:25.980* :  Is it likely that Israel will heed Mr Blinken's words,
*08:25.980- 08:27.960* :  given that so far it's ignored calls
*08:27.960- 08:29.800* :  for even humanitarian pauses?
*08:30.240- 08:33.920* :  Of course, America is Israel's biggest ally
*08:33.920- 08:36.820* :  and puts an awful lot of money in each year
*08:36.820- 08:38.420* :  and provides many of their munitions.
*08:38.420- 08:39.960* :  So they'll have to listen carefully.
*08:40.440- 08:42.740* :  And as I think Mark Lovyn made clear just now,
*08:43.200- 08:46.800* :  Mr Netanyahu has been talking about these very small pauses
*08:47.200- 08:48.480* :  that he would be willing to tolerate.
*08:48.480- 08:51.200* :  And I think if there is movement on the hostage front,
*08:51.200- 08:53.920* :  particularly that'll open that possibility up.
*08:54.300- 08:57.920* :  But he's aware of growing international concern
*08:57.920- 09:00.660* :  about what's happening with the bombardment.
*09:00.900- 09:02.820* :  I'm Mr Blinken, they're talking about the Palestinian authority
*09:02.820- 09:04.000* :  being in charge in Gaza.
*09:04.000- 09:05.480* :  It's in charge of parts of the West Bank.
*09:05.480- 09:07.460* :  But it's very unpopular with Palestinians.
*09:07.740- 09:09.160* :  Quite right, yes it is.
*09:09.160- 09:10.560* :  It's very unpopular there.
*09:10.760- 09:13.920* :  And already Mark Moodabas, the Palestinian president,
*09:13.920- 09:16.940* :  has said he would only be willing to come into Gaza
*09:17.360- 09:21.640* :  to govern there, provided there was a clear policy
*09:21.640- 09:22.900* :  for a two-state solution.
*09:22.900- 09:25.080* :  So a creation of a Palestinian state.
*09:25.460- 09:28.820* :  And if not, he'd worry he'd be seen as some sort of stooge
*09:28.820- 09:30.080* :  for the Israelis and the Americans
*09:30.080- 09:32.040* :  and if he even more unpopular then.
*09:32.660- 09:33.220* :  Mike Thompson.
*09:33.840- 09:35.180* :  Since the conflict in Gaza began,
*09:35.260- 09:37.120* :  the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah
*09:37.120- 09:39.420* :  has been firing rockets into Northern Israel,
*09:39.420- 09:42.660* :  heightening fears of a wider war in the Middle East.
*09:43.060- 09:44.620* :  Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran,
*09:44.620- 09:46.860* :  is classed as a terrorist organization
*09:46.900- 09:49.620* :  by the UK, the US, and the Arab League.
*09:50.180- 09:52.020* :  One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction
*09:52.020- 09:53.360* :  of its neighbor Israel.
*09:53.940- 09:57.000* :  Now in a rare interview, Hezbollah's deputy chief,
*09:57.000- 09:59.840* :  Sheikh Naim Qassam, has been speaking to the BBC.
*10:00.420- 10:03.180* :  A senior international correspondent, Al-Agarin,
*10:03.420- 10:05.180* :  asked him about the concerns the conflict
*10:05.180- 10:06.940* :  could spread beyond Gaza.
*10:08.380- 10:10.960* :  If a Zaid al-Odwan was a Samar,
*10:11.560- 10:14.320* :  if the aggression increases and continues at the space,
*10:15.460- 10:17.720* :  very dangerous and very serious developments
*10:17.720- 10:19.200* :  could occur in the region.
*10:20.260- 10:22.440* :  No one would be able to stop the repercussions.
*10:23.180- 10:25.600* :  Bittakid, for sure, there is a danger
*10:25.600- 10:27.920* :  of a wider regional war breaking out.
*10:27.920- 10:29.500* :  Eclimia, Wasea.
*10:30.300- 10:32.340* :  How realistic do you think is that danger now?
*10:32.340- 10:33.640* :  How close is that danger?
*10:34.600- 10:37.600* :  The danger is real.
*10:38.320- 10:41.580* :  Israel, because Israel is increasing its aggression
*10:41.620- 10:44.720* :  against civilians and killing more women and children.
*10:47.620- 10:50.080* :  Is it possible for this to continue and increase
*10:50.560- 10:52.980* :  without bringing really danger to the region?
*10:53.680- 10:55.780* :  I think not.
*10:56.940- 10:57.540* :  Asteradeh.
*10:58.680- 11:00.480* :  We know that Hezbollah has weapons
*11:00.480- 11:02.660* :  that can reach deep inside Israel.
*11:03.520- 11:04.940* :  But if you were to use them,
*11:04.940- 11:07.120* :  Israel can respond with air power
*11:07.420- 11:08.840* :  and it has promised a response
*11:08.840- 11:11.140* :  of unimaginable magnitude.
*11:11.900- 11:13.620* :  And many Lebanese could die.
*11:14.200- 11:16.140* :  Are you willing to risk that?
*11:17.160- 11:18.480* :  Well, Amr Adi, what are we?
*11:18.760- 11:20.040* :  It's normal and natural.
*11:20.800- 11:22.300* :  And we are ready to pay the price.
*11:23.080- 11:26.500* :  But the question is, can Israel pay the price?
*11:26.980- 11:28.340* :  This is a question for Israel.
*11:29.280- 11:30.740* :  With the cross-border attacks
*11:30.740- 11:33.200* :  that you have been carrying out over the past month,
*11:33.920- 11:37.660* :  isn't there a risk of dragging Lebanon into war,
*11:38.040- 11:41.540* :  even unintentionally, a war that Lebanon can't afford
*11:41.540- 11:45.480* :  and for which there appears to be absolutely no support here?
*11:49.440- 11:52.200* :  It's the right of any Lebanese to be afraid of a war.
*11:52.960- 11:53.600* :  This is normal.
*11:54.080- 11:55.020* :  Nobody likes war.
*11:56.520- 11:58.360* :  But who is responsible for this war?
*11:59.420- 12:01.560* :  Did we start it or did Israel?
*12:02.360- 12:05.800* :  Well, Muhammad, and what's most important
*12:05.800- 12:07.720* :  is that the Israelis were the one
*12:07.760- 12:09.840* :  who started this aggression against Gaza
*12:10.380- 12:11.540* :  in this hideous way.
*12:12.200- 12:13.960* :  Al-Beshia, Al-Lati Hassalat.
*12:14.180- 12:17.020* :  With respect, Hamas started by attacking Israel
*12:17.460- 12:18.520* :  on the 7th of October
*12:18.520- 12:20.840* :  and killing more than 1,400 Israelis,
*12:21.500- 12:23.760* :  most of whom were civilians, women and children.
*12:24.280- 12:27.280* :  So this round of warfare began with Hamas,
*12:27.540- 12:28.340* :  not with Israel.
*12:29.560- 12:33.240* :  What should the Palestinians do
*12:33.240- 12:35.440* :  to regain their freedom and their land?
*12:36.520- 12:39.160* :  This operation was inevitable
*12:40.500- 12:43.420* :  and it was an act of resistance and of defense.
*12:44.120- 12:46.740* :  Some would say that the attacks on October 7
*12:46.740- 12:49.480* :  have been a disaster for the Palestinian cause
*12:49.660- 12:53.480* :  because the result has been massive destruction in Gaza,
*12:54.000- 12:55.940* :  the killing of thousands of civilians,
*12:56.640- 12:58.580* :  including more than 4,000 children.
*12:59.360- 13:02.120* :  Haven't the attacks actually backfired?
*13:02.660- 13:07.120* :  I think what happened was a great achievement
*13:07.120- 13:08.700* :  for the Palestinian resistance.
*13:11.220- 13:13.780* :  Now the massacres committed by Israel
*13:14.200- 13:15.760* :  are mobilizing the Palestinians
*13:16.340- 13:18.580* :  more and more to cling to their land.
*13:20.660- 13:22.620* :  And they know there is no solution
*13:22.620- 13:24.300* :  except for continued resistance.
*13:26.020- 13:28.780* :  But you say you consider the attack a great success,
*13:28.780- 13:32.220* :  but 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since this attack.
*13:32.880- 13:35.540* :  And who knows how many more will die?
*13:39.700- 13:40.880* :  Who killed the Palestinians?
*13:41.820- 13:43.520* :  It was the crazy Israelis.
*13:44.440- 13:47.620* :  Would you intervene more militarily?
*13:47.620- 13:49.920* :  Would there be a stronger military reaction
*13:49.920- 13:54.620* :  from his bollard if Hamas is in danger of being beaten in Gaza?
*13:58.100- 13:59.700* :  This is a matter for the future
*14:00.260- 14:01.540* :  and what happens in the battle.
*14:02.780- 14:05.100* :  It's something we do not talk about in the media.
*14:07.260- 14:10.700* :  But we have our plans for more confrontation and resistance,
*14:11.760- 14:14.080* :  depending on what the circumstances require.
*14:15.400- 14:17.040* :  The deputy chief of his bollard,
*14:17.040- 14:20.320* :  Sheikh Naim Qasim, speaking to the BBC's Ola Gehrin.
*14:21.380- 14:22.380* :  Moving on to other news now,
*14:22.380- 14:24.860* :  voters across the US went to the polls on Tuesday
*14:24.860- 14:27.760* :  for an array of key races that may set the tone
*14:27.800- 14:30.020* :  for the presidential election next year.
*14:30.680- 14:32.120* :  In one vote in Ohio,
*14:32.120- 14:34.300* :  the latest results indicate that the state
*14:34.300- 14:36.920* :  has become the seventh to back abortion rights,
*14:37.280- 14:39.360* :  following the Supreme Court's decision last year
*14:39.680- 14:42.440* :  to remove abortion as an individual federal right.
*14:43.020- 14:45.380* :  These pro-choice campaigners in the city of Columbus
*14:45.380- 14:47.500* :  said they were delighted with the result.
*14:48.280- 14:51.100* :  Threatening to take my rights away from my children
*14:51.100- 14:53.320* :  and my grandchildren is a no-go.
*14:53.920- 14:55.020* :  You cannot do that.
*14:55.020- 14:55.820* :  We are women.
*14:55.840- 14:59.140* :  We are strong and powerful heroes for it.
*14:59.360- 15:00.140* :  We're a static,
*15:00.520- 15:01.940* :  but I will tell you that I'll wake up tomorrow
*15:01.940- 15:04.220* :  and just pinch myself to make sure it really happens,
*15:04.220- 15:06.980* :  because this has been so much trauma for all of us,
*15:07.400- 15:08.840* :  going through the whole scenario
*15:09.240- 15:11.940* :  of the state legislature trying to take away our rights
*15:11.940- 15:13.220* :  to bodily autonomy.
*15:14.020- 15:15.700* :  Our North American correspondent, Peter Bose,
*15:15.700- 15:18.660* :  told us more about the significance of the Ohio result.
*15:19.720- 15:22.160* :  This is clearly a very important result,
*15:22.160- 15:25.220* :  especially for those supporters of reproductive rights,
*15:25.220- 15:26.560* :  not only in Ohio,
*15:27.100- 15:28.200* :  but across the country.
*15:28.200- 15:30.540* :  This was a very closely fought race.
*15:30.720- 15:32.980* :  Ohio is a swing state.
*15:32.980- 15:36.160* :  So effectively, the numbers of Democrats and Republicans
*15:36.740- 15:37.460* :  about the same,
*15:37.460- 15:39.880* :  this suggests that a significant number
*15:40.260- 15:42.460* :  of Republicans in that state
*15:43.000- 15:45.040* :  support reproductive rights,
*15:45.100- 15:47.120* :  and they therefore disagree
*15:47.120- 15:50.880* :  with what the Supreme Court decided last year.
*15:51.160- 15:52.660* :  And the implications of this,
*15:52.720- 15:54.520* :  well, we've got the general election,
*15:54.520- 15:56.780* :  the presidential election coming up next year.
*15:56.780- 15:59.040* :  We know that reproductive rights
*15:59.040- 16:01.800* :  was a very important issue last year
*16:01.800- 16:03.100* :  during the midterm elections,
*16:03.580- 16:06.060* :  and it seems as if as the months passed by,
*16:06.060- 16:08.700* :  likely Joe Biden against Donald Trump,
*16:08.700- 16:11.860* :  again, that this will be one of those key issues
*16:11.860- 16:14.960* :  that could decide that election in a year's time.
*16:15.340- 16:18.200* :  The Democrats will be certainly encouraged,
*16:18.200- 16:20.360* :  at least in terms of the issues
*16:20.360- 16:23.160* :  that have been at stake in this vote tonight,
*16:23.160- 16:25.480* :  and especially the issue of abortion.
*16:25.480- 16:27.520* :  We've got one significant result,
*16:27.520- 16:30.600* :  the Democratic governor in Kentucky,
*16:30.620- 16:32.720* :  although Republican state,
*16:32.760- 16:35.380* :  but he's a very popular Democrat governor.
*16:35.380- 16:38.960* :  He has been re-elected against an opponent,
*16:38.960- 16:41.440* :  a Republican opponent who had the support
*16:42.020- 16:43.520* :  of Donald Trump.
*16:43.640- 16:46.480* :  So clearly, that is a victory for the Democrats,
*16:46.480- 16:50.160* :  and I think, although the worry for Democrats at the moment
*16:50.600- 16:53.800* :  is the support that President Biden is receiving
*16:54.180- 16:55.320* :  at a personal level.
*16:55.420- 16:57.260* :  A lot of people, a lot of Democrats,
*16:57.260- 17:00.720* :  how doubts about Mr. Biden as an individual,
*17:00.980- 17:01.880* :  fighting this election,
*17:01.880- 17:03.740* :  but I think the Democrats will be pleased
*17:03.740- 17:07.840* :  at the way in which voters are receiving the issues
*17:07.840- 17:09.300* :  that are important to the party.
*17:10.880- 17:11.440* :  Peter Bose.
*17:12.140- 17:14.360* :  El Salvador made history in 2021
*17:14.360- 17:17.820* :  by becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.
*17:18.260- 17:21.240* :  The plan was praised by enthusiasts of the digital currency
*17:21.240- 17:23.000* :  who welcomed financial freedom,
*17:23.080- 17:24.880* :  but criticized by many economists
*17:24.880- 17:27.620* :  and financial institutions concerned about volatility.
*17:28.220- 17:30.760* :  But two years later, the verdict of Salvadorans themselves
*17:30.760- 17:33.160* :  has been mixed as Catherine Ellis reports.
*17:36.280- 17:38.820* :  At a small coffee shop in El Salvador's capital,
*17:38.820- 17:41.220* :  customers come for freshly made coffee,
*17:41.660- 17:44.680* :  packets of high-quality beans, and to pay him Bitcoin.
*17:48.300- 17:50.520* :  The digital currency has been legal tender
*17:50.520- 17:53.420* :  in the Central American country for more than two years.
*17:54.100- 17:56.860* :  Businesses are officially required to accept Bitcoin,
*17:56.860- 17:59.980* :  but patchy technology and limited internet access
*18:00.520- 18:03.380* :  and a lack of enforcement means only some do.
*18:03.960- 18:05.520* :  We have a little sign outside the door
*18:05.520- 18:06.680* :  that says Bitcoin accepted.
*18:07.260- 18:09.340* :  Coffee shop owner, Gay Gutierrez,
*18:09.660- 18:13.020* :  says taking Bitcoin payments has helped him to attract customers.
*18:13.740- 18:16.920* :  On a normal month, a 5% to 10% of her sales are in Bitcoin.
*18:16.920- 18:19.300* :  The business impact has been very positive
*18:19.340- 18:21.240* :  and since obviously it's bringing revenue,
*18:21.240- 18:23.480* :  but it's not only that, it's more convenient.
*18:24.420- 18:26.940* :  President Naid Bukheli claimed adopting Bitcoin
*18:26.940- 18:29.720* :  would reduce dependence on the country's other currency,
*18:30.180- 18:34.540* :  the US dollar, and make it cheaper to send and receive remittances
*18:35.060- 18:37.340* :  when migrants send home money to their family.
*18:38.140- 18:40.580* :  But in the first six months of 2023,
*18:40.580- 18:42.920* :  according to El Salvador's central bank,
*18:43.520- 18:46.840* :  only around 1% of remittances were received in Bitcoin.
*18:47.620- 18:49.520* :  Many Salvadorans, like Delmi Brand,
*18:49.520- 18:51.600* :  say they're not using the currency.
*18:52.260- 18:54.340* :  They are looking to educate the people
*18:54.340- 18:57.760* :  in how to use the currency than maybe we could.
*18:58.580- 19:01.300* :  Others like Bayer-Tonorio think the government's decision
*19:01.300- 19:02.360* :  was irresponsible.
*19:03.220- 19:05.120* :  I don't think those of us at the bottom
*19:05.120- 19:06.940* :  will see the benefits of it.
*19:08.140- 19:11.100* :  El Salvador has lost an estimated $40 million
*19:11.100- 19:14.560* :  of its total investments in Bitcoin since 2021,
*19:15.320- 19:17.720* :  due to a decline in the value of the cryptocurrency.
*19:18.460- 19:21.560* :  Carlos Acevedo is an economist and form president
*19:21.560- 19:23.880* :  of El Salvador's central reserve bank.
*19:23.880- 19:27.120* :  He says Bitcoin is not suited for legal tender.
*19:27.900- 19:29.300* :  It's like playing monopoly.
*19:29.800- 19:30.960* :  For people as the poor,
*19:30.960- 19:35.480* :  they can't afford to take a drop in 5% to 10% in one day.
*19:36.120- 19:38.620* :  But the government is continuing to push Bitcoin.
*19:39.040- 19:40.420* :  It recently announced education
*19:40.420- 19:43.060* :  would be compulsory in schools from 2024.
*19:43.700- 19:46.740* :  While some say El Salvador's Bitcoin project hasn't worked,
*19:46.740- 19:49.780* :  there are others who believe it's only just beginning.
*19:50.940- 19:53.160* :  Catherine Ellis reporting from El Salvador.

*20:07.620- 20:08.880* :  In original pronunciation,

*21:19.640- 21:23.420* :  is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*21:23.740- 21:26.840* :  At its peak, WeWork was worth $47 billion.
*21:27.960- 21:30.500* :  And Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*21:30.540- 21:33.080* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila
*21:33.080- 21:35.640* :  and made people do shots during business meetings.
*21:35.820- 21:38.580* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever,
*21:38.580- 21:40.620* :  to become the world's first trillionaire
*21:40.620- 21:42.320* :  and expand his company to Mars.
*21:42.900- 21:44.420* :  What we learned in the last couple of weeks
*21:44.420- 21:47.500* :  is in reality, he oversaw one of the most spectacular
*21:47.500- 21:49.200* :  business failures in modern history.
*21:49.280- 21:52.060* :  So is he good, bad, or just another billionaire?
*21:52.340- 21:54.420* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire
*21:54.420- 21:55.800* :  wherever you get your podcasts.
*22:02.980- 22:04.680* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*22:05.240- 22:07.960* :  China has indicated that it's willing to improve relations
*22:07.960- 22:10.700* :  with the US, which have been severely strained
*22:10.700- 22:11.700* :  over recent years.
*22:12.180- 22:15.580* :  But major obstacles remain as Mickey Bristol reports.
*22:16.660- 22:19.200* :  In the speech in Singapore, China's vice president,
*22:19.200- 22:21.640* :  Hang Zheng, said the world was big enough
*22:21.640- 22:24.700* :  for both countries to prosper, and that Beijing
*22:24.700- 22:27.020* :  was willing to hold talks at all levels.
*22:27.720- 22:30.180* :  Although I'm confirmed, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping,
*22:30.180- 22:33.400* :  is expected to meet President Biden in San Francisco
*22:33.400- 22:34.100* :  next week.
*22:34.980- 22:37.040* :  The US has also indicated its willingness
*22:37.040- 22:39.580* :  to improve relations by sending a number
*22:39.580- 22:41.740* :  of top officials to Beijing this year.
*22:42.300- 22:45.640* :  But major differences over trade, security, and human rights,
*22:46.200- 22:47.960* :  and how each country sees the world,
*22:48.440- 22:50.740* :  remain obstacles to a genuine improvement
*22:50.740- 22:51.940* :  in their relationship.
*22:52.760- 22:55.260* :  Mickey Bristol, India Supreme Court
*22:55.260- 22:57.360* :  has been questioning the federal government
*22:57.480- 23:00.200* :  about allegations of violence against women
*23:00.200- 23:02.140* :  in the Northeastern state of Manipur.
*23:02.780- 23:06.520* :  This comes as a response to a petition being filed
*23:06.520- 23:09.820* :  by two women who were filmed being paraded naked
*23:09.820- 23:11.940* :  and sexually assaulted by a mob.
*23:12.460- 23:15.560* :  The attack happened in May, but the video only came to light
*23:15.560- 23:17.980* :  in July causing widespread outrage.
*23:18.640- 23:20.500* :  The two women have been speaking to the BBC's
*23:20.500- 23:22.620* :  Divya Arya, who has been following the story.
*23:23.280- 23:26.680* :  She began by telling us about the video,
*23:27.120- 23:30.040* :  a warning some listeners may find this distressing.
*23:31.380- 23:32.780* :  It was a very shocking video.
*23:33.120- 23:34.220* :  Very difficult to watch.
*23:35.320- 23:38.280* :  We saw two women absolutely naked,
*23:38.280- 23:41.220* :  surrounded by a huge mob of men
*23:41.840- 23:44.280* :  who were harassing them,
*23:44.620- 23:46.480* :  groping them, pushing them forward,
*23:47.020- 23:48.720* :  and eventually take them into a field.
*23:49.560- 23:51.800* :  And we later found out,
*23:52.200- 23:53.740* :  now that I've spoken to these women
*23:53.800- 23:55.820* :  and because they've made an official complaint
*23:55.820- 23:58.700* :  to the police that they were also gangraped.
*23:59.380- 24:02.860* :  When I met them, they were very quiet, right downcast.
*24:03.160- 24:04.340* :  They kept their eyes lowered.
*24:05.100- 24:08.560* :  They seem to want to be invisible.
*24:09.520- 24:12.800* :  They wore black masks and they covered their heads
*24:12.980- 24:13.680* :  with a scarf.
*24:14.360- 24:17.060* :  And of course, they shared disturbing details
*24:17.500- 24:18.260* :  about the trauma.
*24:19.320- 24:20.960* :  This is glory and mercy.
*24:21.460- 24:23.580* :  We've changed their names to protect their identities
*24:23.580- 24:26.200* :  and we've got actors to speak their words.
*24:27.140- 24:29.180* :  I was treated like an animal.
*24:30.080- 24:31.580* :  And after the video got viral,
*24:32.840- 24:34.900* :  I didn't have any hope to continue living.
*24:36.240- 24:38.560* :  The way they tortured me was traumatizing.
*24:38.920- 24:42.020* :  As a woman, my pride has been taken away from me.
*24:43.000- 24:46.640* :  The mob killed my brother and father in front of my eyes.
*24:47.200- 24:48.720* :  I want justice for them too.
*24:49.400- 24:51.040* :  I still have difficulties sleeping
*24:51.040- 24:53.140* :  and get nightmares even now.
*24:53.280- 24:55.560* :  I find it hard to step out of the house.
*24:55.820- 24:58.360* :  I feel scared and ashamed of meeting people.
*25:00.080- 25:01.040* :  When I met them now,
*25:01.280- 25:02.560* :  now it's going to be six months.
*25:03.360- 25:05.940* :  They do feel a bit more in control
*25:05.940- 25:09.140* :  of their emotions, their well-being
*25:09.140- 25:11.340* :  because they're being supported by the community.
*25:12.460- 25:15.380* :  And as our conversation came to a close,
*25:15.960- 25:19.200* :  they even spoke of their dreams and life ahead.
*25:20.100- 25:21.500* :  I want to go back to college
*25:22.020- 25:23.880* :  and become an army or police officer.
*25:24.800- 25:26.180* :  It was always my dream.
*25:27.080- 25:29.760* :  But after the attack, my resolve has strengthened.
*25:30.800- 25:33.300* :  I want to be an officer who works for everyone
*25:33.920- 25:35.480* :  in an unbiased manner.
*25:36.400- 25:39.040* :  I want to tell all mothers of all communities
*25:39.820- 25:40.940* :  to teach their children
*25:41.520- 25:44.840* :  no matter what happens, never disrespect women.
*25:46.200- 25:50.100* :  The video just got the attention of the administration
*25:50.240- 25:51.720* :  and the police onto the case.
*25:52.260- 25:53.500* :  Seven men were arrested.
*25:54.280- 25:56.600* :  Five police officers, including the officer in charge
*25:56.600- 25:58.940* :  on the day of the violence, were suspended
*25:58.940- 26:01.840* :  as has been confirmed by the police to us.
*26:02.360- 26:03.980* :  And they're being investigated now
*26:03.980- 26:05.600* :  for their role at that time.
*26:06.500- 26:08.200* :  That report by Divya Arya
*26:08.260- 26:09.280* :  and you can hear that story
*26:09.280- 26:12.560* :  in full on the what in the world podcast.
*26:14.040- 26:16.320* :  Scientists say this year is virtually certain
*26:16.360- 26:17.820* :  to be the hottest on record
*26:17.820- 26:21.060* :  after an exceptionally warm October around the world.
*26:21.480- 26:24.040* :  Our environment correspondent Matt McGraw explains.
*26:25.100- 26:27.260* :  October has become the fifth month in a row
*26:27.260- 26:30.980* :  to set a new high, as well as rising carbon dioxide emissions.
*26:31.520- 26:33.060* :  Temperatures are being driven up this year
*26:33.060- 26:34.940* :  by a strengthening El Niño,
*26:35.340- 26:37.500* :  a natural event that brings heat to the surface
*26:37.500- 26:38.720* :  of the Pacific Ocean.
*26:39.340- 26:40.400* :  Scientists told the BBC
*26:40.400- 26:43.140* :  it was now more than 99% certain
*26:43.140- 26:46.500* :  that 2023 would become the warmest year on record.
*26:46.580- 26:49.240* :  They worn at the likelihood of more extreme events,
*26:49.760- 26:52.360* :  including wildfires, heat waves and storms.
*26:53.020- 26:55.720* :  Jamaica's Minister of Tourism, Edmund Bartlett,
*26:55.720- 26:58.860* :  told us how climate change is impacting his country.
*26:59.960- 27:01.740* :  Certainly for the Caribbean,
*27:01.740- 27:06.160* :  we began with really intense heat as we'd never seen before.
*27:06.840- 27:10.080* :  We also had an impact on the raining pattern
*27:10.520- 27:12.900* :  within the region, and then we began
*27:12.900- 27:15.100* :  to have adverse weather conditions
*27:15.100- 27:17.460* :  with excessive rainfall
*27:18.240- 27:20.500* :  and much of the Caribbean having
*27:21.180- 27:24.660* :  very, very high-end gusty type of wind and rain.
*27:25.260- 27:29.760* :  Fortunately, no hurricane of an impact on this year so far,
*27:30.340- 27:33.060* :  but we know that in the last five years,
*27:33.200- 27:37.400* :  we've had very, very, very extensive weather patterns
*27:37.400- 27:41.000* :  with hurricanes getting to category five and beyond
*27:41.720- 27:43.780* :  situations that we'd not seen before.
*27:44.340- 27:47.560* :  But there's a feature that has enabled a different view
*27:47.560- 27:51.180* :  and feeling in the last few months, in fact,
*27:51.180- 27:53.120* :  within the region and that's earthquakes,
*27:53.720- 27:57.220* :  and we've not had as many earthquakes in the region.
*27:57.940- 28:00.420* :  Jamaica's Tourism Minister, Edmund Bartlett.
*28:01.380- 28:04.200* :  Now it's one of the greatest works of English literature.
*28:04.440- 28:06.760* :  The first furtio of plays by William Shakespeare
*28:06.760- 28:10.340* :  was compiled by his friends and published 400 years ago
*28:10.340- 28:12.020* :  seven years after his death.
*28:12.720- 28:15.600* :  Without it, many of his plays would have been lost forever.
*28:16.240- 28:17.380* :  To celebrate the anniversary,
*28:17.380- 28:20.220* :  copies of the furtio are being displayed in theatres,
*28:20.620- 28:22.820* :  including in Prescott in the north of England.
*28:23.520- 28:25.040* :  David's little went to the theatre,
*28:25.260- 28:26.320* :  called Shakespeare North,
*28:26.800- 28:29.120* :  to find out how it's trying to make the bard
*28:29.640- 28:31.040* :  relevant to people today.
*28:32.220- 28:36.420* :  Welcome to Prescott, and I think it's probably time
*28:36.420- 28:36.960* :  for a pint.
*28:38.600- 28:39.140* :  So where are we?
*28:39.380- 28:40.880* :  We're in the Mamie Tavern in Prescott.
*28:41.200- 28:42.700* :  Now, it wasn't the Mamie Tavern last time was here.
*28:42.860- 28:44.060* :  It wasn't. It was a red lion.
*28:44.740- 28:45.600* :  So why's it changed?
*28:45.780- 28:48.880* :  The Mamie Tavern is actually a place where Shakespeare used to drink.
*28:49.500- 28:50.560* :  It's a pub in London.
*28:50.720- 28:51.280* :  I believe.
*28:51.920- 28:52.940* :  Shakespeare's good for business.
*28:53.180- 28:54.660* :  Definitely good for business, yeah.
*28:58.120- 28:58.820* :  And it goes on.
*28:59.020- 29:01.300* :  We've got about 100 yards, and this is...
*29:01.300- 29:04.300* :  Makushios, we've been open for about 27 weeks now,
*29:04.740- 29:06.520* :  as Makushio's bar and B-stomper.
*29:07.420- 29:10.120* :  And now another 50 yards on, and there's a giant picture of...
*29:10.400- 29:11.280* :  Yep, it's Shakespeare.
*29:11.640- 29:12.700* :  And this is...
*29:13.540- 29:14.600* :  The Lord Strange.
*29:14.620- 29:15.360* :  Cheers!
*29:16.720- 29:17.280* :  Another pub.
*29:19.100- 29:20.340* :  I'm still going, I think.
*29:21.140- 29:22.560* :  This is the sixth.
*29:22.900- 29:23.800* :  We've gone past now.
*29:24.060- 29:25.300* :  This is the bard.
*29:26.240- 29:26.820* :  The bard.
*29:29.180- 29:33.980* :  And there's a reason why Prescott has so many new Shakespearean pubs.
*29:34.540- 29:35.380* :  A new theatre.
*29:35.860- 29:40.360* :  Shakespeare North is a recreation of a venue from Shakespeare's time,
*29:40.360- 29:44.980* :  which used to stand on a site, now occupied by 10 Downing Street.
*29:45.720- 29:49.960* :  And the theatre has a mission, both economic and cultural.
*29:50.220- 29:52.820* :  A desire to bring Shakespeare to a new audience
*29:53.420- 29:55.860* :  and to bring new voices onto the stage.
*29:56.240- 29:57.760* :  Full of taxation, come out.
*29:58.280- 30:00.880* :  With complaint, it gives my child my daughter hernia.
*30:01.160- 30:04.500* :  One actor who got her first break here from an open audition
*30:05.160- 30:07.420* :  is Teberra Easton, from Newcastle.
*30:07.480- 30:09.220* :  There was times when I was on stage,
*30:09.220- 30:11.620* :  and I just couldn't quite believe that that was my job.
*30:11.740- 30:13.240* :  You're not from a posh background, are you?
*30:13.440- 30:14.280* :  I'm not, no.
*30:14.800- 30:17.580* :  I'm from a counsellor's state kid.
*30:17.700- 30:19.280* :  You would be fair to say, before this,
*30:20.100- 30:22.960* :  there hadn't been a lot of Shakespeare in her life.
*30:23.120- 30:26.180* :  You know, I hadn't saw any of the plays when I was younger or anything like that.
*30:26.180- 30:30.300* :  We didn't study Shakespeare, so my first real hit of Shakespeare
*30:30.300- 30:32.300* :  was when I got the poll.
*30:32.840- 30:35.600* :  And there's good reason for a wider range of voices,
*30:35.600- 30:38.280* :  because the accents that used to be taught in drama schools
*30:38.940- 30:41.600* :  might not be getting the best out of the words.
*30:42.280- 30:44.760* :  The actor Ben Crystal is working with the theatre,
*30:45.380- 30:49.080* :  and an expert in the original sound of William Shakespeare.
*30:49.580- 30:51.740* :  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
*30:52.520- 30:54.780* :  Th art more lovely and more temperate,
*30:54.880- 30:58.040* :  rough wines to shake the darlin' boots of may
*30:58.040- 31:00.860* :  and summer's less at all too short to date.
*31:01.480- 31:04.360* :  So that's real Shakespearean Shakespeare.
*31:04.660- 31:06.440* :  That's a reconstruction of the accent
*31:06.480- 31:09.560* :  that Shakespeare and his actors would have spoken in 400 years ago.
*31:10.220- 31:13.160* :  And frankly, there are aspects of it not working in the accent
*31:13.160- 31:15.440* :  that we're used to hearing in, because the rhymes don't work.
*31:16.300- 31:18.580* :  If this be error and upon me proved,
*31:19.100- 31:21.200* :  I never writ no no man ever loved.
*31:22.120- 31:23.380* :  In original pronunciation,
*31:23.980- 31:25.980* :  if this be error and upon me proved,
*31:25.980- 31:28.360* :  I never writ no no man ever loved.
*31:29.200- 31:30.120* :  I mean, we're impressed God.
*31:30.260- 31:33.420* :  If you do it in a local accent, does that work, is that right?
*31:33.420- 31:34.940* :  Yeah, absolutely.
*31:35.620- 31:37.720* :  If you come to a theatre like this
*31:37.880- 31:40.620* :  where you can pay very little to be here
*31:41.340- 31:45.580* :  and where you can hear a sound that's familiar to you,
*31:46.060- 31:49.180* :  I think you're getting as close as we can possibly get
*31:49.180- 31:51.300* :  to Shakespeare without use of a tardis.
*31:52.160- 31:55.660* :  The actor Ben Crystal ending that report by David Slito.
*31:56.740- 31:57.400* :  Earlier this year,
*31:57.400- 31:59.360* :  we reported on how a Nigerian chef
*31:59.420- 32:01.620* :  caused a sensation in her home country
*32:01.620- 32:05.040* :  by breaking the world record for cooking nonstop.
*32:05.680- 32:07.480* :  But now she's been dethroned.
*32:07.800- 32:11.200* :  Irish chef, Anne Vischer, spent 119 hours
*32:11.480- 32:13.500* :  and 57 minutes peeling potatoes,
*32:13.500- 32:16.680* :  seasoning stews and finessing dishes without a break.
*32:17.280- 32:18.660* :  He lives in Matsuri in Japan
*32:18.660- 32:20.900* :  where he has an Irish-themed restaurant.
*32:21.460- 32:23.000* :  My colleague, Nick Miles, asked him,
*32:23.240- 32:24.900* :  what the most difficult part was
*32:24.900- 32:26.860* :  of such a grueling challenge.
*32:28.180- 32:30.000* :  There was two things that stand out in particular.
*32:30.000- 32:32.660* :  I think for the baking because I chose not to use a bread mix
*32:32.660- 32:34.060* :  or I made everything by hand.
*32:34.060- 32:37.780* :  I was standing for almost 47 hours, hand-needing bread,
*32:38.260- 32:39.380* :  which took a toll on my back
*32:39.380- 32:41.780* :  because I'm quite tall, I'm 6.7 and my back,
*32:41.780- 32:42.720* :  I was leaning over,
*32:42.840- 32:44.800* :  just that took a hell of a physical toll.
*32:45.200- 32:48.200* :  From the cooking, it was more like of a mental challenge,
*32:48.200- 32:50.600* :  you know, it was trying to manage the man.
*32:50.600- 32:52.860* :  Did you peel 300 kilos of potatoes?
*32:53.220- 32:56.140* :  Yeah, and I blistered on my hands by the end of it.
*32:56.420- 32:58.300* :  It was five days in total for the cooking
*32:58.300- 33:01.120* :  and there was hundreds of people queuing out the door.
*33:01.620- 33:03.080* :  And I had a restaurant mindset
*33:03.080- 33:05.380* :  where I had to kind of maintain the same quality
*33:05.380- 33:06.500* :  as I would in the stewhouse
*33:06.920- 33:08.440* :  and then cook large volumes
*33:08.640- 33:10.200* :  because I didn't want people waiting for hours
*33:10.200- 33:11.080* :  not to get any food.
*33:11.460- 33:12.600* :  I was going to say about the quality.
*33:12.640- 33:14.860* :  I mean, on one stage, I hear you were hallucinating
*33:15.220- 33:16.160* :  through lack of sleep.
*33:16.400- 33:19.660* :  And hallucinating doesn't sound as it's conducive to
*33:20.120- 33:22.180* :  culinary finesse, but you managed to do it, do you think?
*33:22.900- 33:24.780* :  Yeah, well, I remembered that was just a small thing
*33:24.780- 33:25.420* :  towards the end.
*33:25.460- 33:27.180* :  I'd thought I'd seen someone in the corner of my eye
*33:27.180- 33:28.760* :  and I just asked, oh, will you pass me that something?
*33:28.760- 33:31.840* :  But it was just a daydream or something.
*33:31.840- 33:34.580* :  But yeah, I've been turning through those recipes
*33:34.580- 33:35.800* :  for the last nine years.
*33:35.800- 33:37.300* :  So I was kind of in zombie mode
*33:37.300- 33:39.000* :  just making them over and over again, you know.
*33:39.120- 33:40.580* :  And what training would you recommend
*33:40.580- 33:42.220* :  for anybody trying to beat your record?
*33:42.940- 33:45.420* :  I would say if anyone can take inspiration from
*33:45.420- 33:46.900* :  just if there's something negative in their life
*33:47.040- 33:48.380* :  and they want to channel it into something positive,
*33:48.380- 33:50.360* :  buying off like just loads of records you could do
*33:50.360- 33:51.460* :  or take on either of these.
*33:52.120- 33:54.040* :  I know it definitely calmed the fire
*33:54.040- 33:55.960* :  and frustration in my heart a little bit.
*33:56.000- 33:57.740* :  So I'm just glad I don't need to do it again.
*33:58.020- 34:00.080* :  I tried for a month's approval.
*34:00.660- 34:01.880* :  It's probably done quite a lot of good
*34:01.880- 34:03.660* :  for your restaurant business as well, I imagine.
*34:04.300- 34:07.020* :  Yeah, what's interesting is like 9,000 miles away
*34:07.020- 34:09.720* :  from home in this small town, like Matt,
*34:09.720- 34:11.640* :  what we came here to set up our e-commerce business
*34:11.640- 34:13.460* :  and I was kind of doing it for myself
*34:13.460- 34:15.480* :  and my story and representing Irish food.
*34:15.480- 34:17.560* :  But the community really got behind it.
*34:17.560- 34:20.140* :  I felt I was almost adopted by this small town
*34:20.140- 34:22.100* :  or city here in Matt's away, which was,
*34:22.440- 34:23.660* :  which put a lot of pressures like,
*34:23.660- 34:26.400* :  well, I can't feel no, it's either do this or die trying
*34:26.400- 34:27.780* :  kind of mindset I had to have.
*34:27.780- 34:30.220* :  But yeah, it was something I'll look back on for sure, you know.
*34:31.100- 34:33.560* :  And we've thought night shifts to be hard here at the BBC.
*34:33.560- 34:37.020* :  That was New Guinness World Record holder, Alan Fisher
*34:37.440- 34:39.720* :  and hopefully he's caught up on his sleep.
*34:42.300- 34:43.740* :  And that's all from us for now,
*34:43.740- 34:45.260* :  but there will be a new edition
