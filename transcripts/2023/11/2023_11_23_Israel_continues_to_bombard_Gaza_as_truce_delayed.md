*01:05.340- 01:08.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:10.100- 01:14.420* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT. On Thursday, the 23rd of November, these are our main
*01:14.420- 01:14.860* :  stories.
*01:15.260- 01:20.300* :  Freedom delayed, Israeli hostages in Gaza will have to wait at least another day to be released.
*01:21.020- 01:26.440* :  The Ukrainian children are legally taken and adopted by Russians, including a key Putin
*01:26.440- 01:28.620* :  ally, will bring you a special report.
*01:29.260- 01:34.120* :  We're in the Netherlands after the far right anti-Islamist politician surprises everyone
*01:34.120- 01:35.420* :  with his electoral triumph.
*01:38.240- 01:41.280* :  Also in this podcast, a new breeding ground for these.
*01:47.420- 01:49.540* :  Big, beautiful, blue whales.
*01:55.880- 02:01.760* :  People in Gaza thought they would be experiencing a lot in the conflict at the moment, a four-day
*02:01.760- 02:02.260* :  truce.
*02:02.620- 02:07.160* :  And we had been hoping to tell you that the first of many hostages in Gaza were now free.
*02:07.660- 02:12.960* :  But, the Israeli military says its forces remain in a continued state of combat in Gaza.
*02:13.420- 02:17.020* :  It says it's hit 300 targets there in overnight bombardments.
*02:17.480- 02:22.820* :  Meanwhile, the IDF has confirmed that the director of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza has been detained.
*02:22.820- 02:28.440* :  A senior doctor from Al-Shifa said that the director, Abu Salamiya, was arrested while
*02:28.440- 02:31.420* :  accompanying patients who were evacuated from the hospital.
*02:31.480- 02:33.580* :  I spoke to our correspondent, Yolanda.
*02:34.360- 02:39.120* :  First of all, even as a truce has been discussed, we can see that the fighting is very intense
*02:39.160- 02:39.720* :  in Gaza.
*02:39.740- 02:45.820* :  Clouds of black smoke rising up, deadly Israeli air strikes reported, particularly in the
*02:45.820- 02:50.640* :  north of the Gaza Strip, also in the southern city of Hain Unis.
*02:50.640- 02:55.300* :  That's, of course, in the area that people were told to evacuate to for their own safety.
*02:55.340- 03:01.320* :  The Israeli military said that it hit 300 Hamas targets in the past 24 hours.
*03:01.880- 03:05.700* :  Meanwhile, I've just seen sirens have been sounding again in southern Israel.
*03:05.700- 03:08.920* :  That's usually warns of incoming Palestinian rocket fire.
*03:09.960- 03:13.760* :  And at the same time, yes, hospitals do remain a main focus of what's going on.
*03:13.980- 03:19.000* :  A day after Israel's military show journalists this well-built tunnel at a Shifa hospital,
*03:19.340- 03:24.860* :  which it says was used by Hamas fighters hiding there behind civilians as a human shield.
*03:25.600- 03:29.860* :  Now Israel has confirmed that it's arrested the hospital director and other staff there.
*03:30.420- 03:36.000* :  And all of this, you know, as, of course, Israel and Hamas, both sides are continuing
*03:36.000- 03:38.880* :  to accuse each other of war crimes at this site.
*03:38.900- 03:43.440* :  When it comes to the Indonesian hospital, the director there, up in the north of the
*03:43.440- 03:48.220* :  Gaza Strip, tells us that they have been told by the Israeli military they have to evacuate.
*03:48.760- 03:53.680* :  He's told us at the BBC, he's one of only 10 medics still there, but they have 200 wounded
*03:53.680- 03:57.100* :  people and say they won't leave until they can take them.
*03:57.100- 04:02.840* :  He said it's a very difficult situation with fighting going on nearby, very heavy firing
*04:02.840- 04:03.720* :  near the hospital.
*04:04.240- 04:06.660* :  Let's look at the problems with the planned truce now.
*04:06.880- 04:11.840* :  Katari mediators say they're working towards finalizing a pause to come and to force on
*04:11.840- 04:12.220* :  Friday.
*04:12.660- 04:16.140* :  They say the delay has been caused by paperwork rather than disagreements.
*04:16.140- 04:21.200* :  Gesh on Baskin as a former Israeli hostage negotiator, he gave us this assessment.
*04:22.080- 04:27.420* :  It's a complicated negotiating situation where the people who are the decision makers
*04:27.420- 04:31.040* :  are, in fact, underground and without digital communication.
*04:31.060- 04:36.600* :  So I'm assuming that the delay is simply because of technical details that need to be decided
*04:37.200- 04:42.420* :  by the people underground, maybe problems in locating all the hostages that they're planning
*04:42.420- 04:47.160* :  to release because they're spread out across the Gaza Strip, probably in tunnels and
*04:47.160- 04:48.500* :  in basements of homes.
*04:49.120- 04:54.320* :  And I hope that it's not something more complex than that that would foil the dealing completely.
*04:54.840- 04:59.260* :  But I think it's in the interest of both sides of Israel and Hamas to make sure that this
*04:59.260- 04:59.960* :  deal happens.
*05:00.660- 05:05.000* :  An Israeli government source told the BBC that there are hopes the framework for a deal
*05:05.000- 05:07.920* :  between Hamas and Israel will begin on Friday.
*05:08.020- 05:13.560* :  All the while, those fighting aid agencies can't bring in help, food, water and fuel.
*05:13.960- 05:18.000* :  Imogen folks reports from Geneva now where many UN agencies are based.
*05:19.180- 05:24.740* :  It's as ever superficially calm and quiet here in Geneva, but behind the scenes there's
*05:24.740- 05:31.940* :  frantic activity as UN aid agencies prepare for what they hope will be a sustained truce.
*05:32.180- 05:35.240* :  They've been begging for access to Gaza for weeks now.
*05:35.240- 05:39.740* :  They've got truckloads of aid supplies backed up at the border.
*05:40.240- 05:45.560* :  The needs they say are immense 1.7 million people displaced.
*05:45.980- 05:51.560* :  770,000 of them crammed into UN schools being used as shelters.
*05:52.080- 05:56.640* :  UNICEF has told us that 700 people are sharing one shower.
*05:57.160- 06:00.340* :  There's one toilet per 150 people.
*06:00.940- 06:04.880* :  Healthcare is on the verge of collapse, particularly in Northern Gaza.
*06:05.380- 06:09.420* :  There's two of 24 hospitals are still functioning.
*06:10.180- 06:17.500* :  Many, many over 100 UN staff have been killed in the fighting as well as doctors from the
*06:17.500- 06:19.720* :  medical charity MSF.
*06:20.180- 06:27.500* :  But what's not clear yet is exactly what and how much aid will be allowed in fuel is a big
*06:29.000- 06:29.020* :  question.
*06:29.020- 06:29.520* :  The Israelis are very cautious.
*06:29.520- 06:35.040* :  They fear that Hamas could use it for its fight rather than for hospitals and water
*06:35.040- 06:36.040* :  pumping stations.
*06:36.620- 06:43.780* :  And what about aid workers to go along with the supplies the WHO has surgical teams standing
*06:43.780- 06:47.660* :  by but it's not clear yet whether they will be allowed to go in.
*06:48.120- 06:54.000* :  Now what everybody though is agreed on here in Geneva is that any relief that can be brought
*06:54.000- 07:02.920* :  to families in both Israel and Gaza is welcome every bit of aid will help but even everything
*07:02.920- 07:05.740* :  that goes in is unlikely to be enough.
*07:06.480- 07:07.540* :  Imogen folks there.
*07:08.520- 07:13.300* :  Well the war in Ukraine has been filled with horrors and abuses of course from the killings
*07:13.300- 07:18.000* :  and rapes of Ukrainian civilians in towns north of Kiev in the first few weeks of the war
*07:18.520- 07:23.180* :  to the seemingly indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities close
*07:23.180- 07:24.320* :  to the front line now.
*07:25.280- 07:30.840* :  And now another disturbing discovery in the conflict involving stolen children, a secret
*07:30.840- 07:33.780* :  adoption and a key ally of Vladimir Putin.
*07:34.200- 07:39.720* :  Ukraine says Russia has abducted around 20,000 children since the invasion began in 2022.
*07:40.340- 07:41.840* :  Russia disputes this figure.
*07:42.560- 07:46.560* :  Well the BBC has investigated what happened to more than 40 children who were taken from
*07:46.560- 07:51.480* :  a children's home in Kherson last year and one child in particular, Hillary Anderson
*07:51.480- 07:51.900* :  reports.
*07:56.140- 08:01.100* :  The Russian troops battled to keep control of Kherson last year, a group of more than
*08:01.100- 08:04.020* :  40 Ukrainian children played together in a basement.
*08:09.340- 08:12.220* :  These were children from the Kherson regional children's home.
*08:12.720- 08:17.500* :  Some were orphans, some had special medical needs, others had parents who couldn't look
*08:17.500- 08:18.060* :  after them.
*08:18.820- 08:23.240* :  There were persistent reports in the city that the Russians were taking Ukrainian children.
*08:27.480- 08:29.720* :  Here we have the children's art work.
*08:30.200- 08:34.720* :  Dr. Natalia Lutukova, who cared for children at the nearby local hospital, was worried.
*08:37.120- 08:40.440* :  Here we had words for children from the children's home.
*08:40.440- 08:44.820* :  One of her patients was a 10-month-old girl called Margarita, who had bronchitis.
*08:45.700- 08:49.220* :  Margarita's mother had given up custody soon after she was born.
*08:49.760- 08:52.880* :  Last August a mysterious Russian visitor came to the hospital.
*08:53.640- 08:58.840* :  She introduced herself as an official from Moscow and asked to inspect the children on Margarita's
*08:58.840- 08:59.140* :  ward.
*09:00.020- 09:06.100* :  Shortly after Margarita was sent back to the children's home, then armed Russian men came
*09:06.100- 09:07.800* :  in a car and took her away.
*09:10.300- 09:14.660* :  Seven weeks later the remaining 46 children in the children's home were taken.
*09:16.220- 09:21.640* :  Naming the children one by one Russian officials loaded them onto buses and ambulances to take
*09:21.640- 09:23.920* :  them deeper into Russian control territory.
*09:25.060- 09:29.980* :  A Russian member of parliament appeared to orchestrate the operation and said it was a humanitarian
*09:30.660- 09:30.680* :  mission.
*09:31.300- 09:32.860* :  The Russians filmed the whole event.
*09:34.600- 09:39.880* :  A Ukrainian freelance investigator, Victoria Novikova, has been working with the BBC to try
*09:39.880- 09:42.180* :  to find out what happened to the Horson children.
*09:42.740- 09:49.160* :  The Horson children's home was ripped apart by the Russians.
*09:49.260- 09:53.660* :  They took the children away in different directions, absolutely brazen abductions.
*09:54.560- 09:56.480* :  Victoria began to look for Margarita.
*09:57.100- 10:01.500* :  The first question, who was the woman who visited Margarita in the hospital ward?
*10:02.180- 10:07.340* :  Victoria showed a photo of Russian officials visiting her son that month to Dr. Lutikova,
*10:07.820- 10:10.140* :  who pointed to a woman in a lilac dress.
*10:11.900- 10:17.160* :  This woman dressed in lilac wasn't reduced at the heads of children's affairs.
*10:18.740- 10:21.480* :  She was escorted by three armed soldiers.
*10:22.060- 10:24.920* :  She was the one who went attention to Margarita.
*10:25.320- 10:28.040* :  We uncovered documents that reveal the woman's identity.
*10:28.540- 10:30.420* :  Her name is Ina Varlamava.
*10:30.820- 10:33.460* :  She works for the Russian parliament in an unknown role.
*10:33.980- 10:36.520* :  Later we got hold of documents and train bookings.
*10:36.960- 10:42.520* :  Ina Varlamava had arrived in occupied Ukraine the day Margarita was taken and she returned
*10:42.520- 10:44.100* :  to Moscow that same night.
*10:44.800- 10:45.860* :  Then a breakthrough.
*10:46.320- 10:48.040* :  We found a marriage and birth records.
*10:48.480- 10:52.820* :  Weeks after Margarita was taken, Varlamava married a major Russian politician.
*10:52.940- 10:55.420* :  The couple have a child called Marina.
*10:56.000- 10:59.980* :  Marina's birthday was listed as October 31st, 2021.
*11:00.340- 11:02.720* :  The same day Margarita was born.
*11:05.840- 11:10.320* :  Viksery will be ours, Russia will prevail, Russia will be great.
*11:10.900- 11:15.640* :  Sergei Miranov, pharlemovas' husband, is an ally of President Putin, who strongly supports
*11:15.640- 11:16.540* :  the war in Ukraine.
*11:17.060- 11:20.520* :  The adoption record shows that he and his wife adopted Margarita.
*11:21.140- 11:24.300* :  Her name was changed to Marina and her place of birth to Russia.
*11:25.440- 11:29.540* :  Under international law, removing a child from their home country with no intention of giving
*11:29.540- 11:30.900* :  them back is a war crime.
*11:31.240- 11:34.600* :  The Russian government says it's unaware of the case and can't comment.
*11:35.140- 11:38.460* :  Miranov and Varlamava didn't respond to requests for comment.
*11:39.020- 11:41.840* :  Hillary Anderson with that report for BBC Panorama.
*11:43.000- 11:47.980* :  The World Health Organization has asked China for more information about an outbreak of pneumonia
*11:47.980- 11:51.460* :  in the North of the country that appears to be mostly affecting children.
*11:51.980- 11:55.800* :  The Chinese authorities admitted last month that the country was experiencing an increase
*11:55.800- 12:00.400* :  in respiratory illnesses from Beijing, our China correspondent, Laura Bicca reports.
*12:01.440- 12:05.940* :  China's National Health Commission has attributed a spike in flu-like illnesses this winter
*12:05.940- 12:08.260* :  to the lifting of COVID-19 measures.
*12:08.820- 12:14.020* :  Not in recent weeks reports in non-state media claimed that children's hospitals in Beijing
*12:14.020- 12:18.240* :  and other parts of China were overwhelmed with sick children.
*12:18.860- 12:24.840* :  ProMed, which monitors human and animal disease outbreaks worldwide, has also issued a notification
*12:24.840- 12:30.180* :  detailing a reported epidemic of undiagnosed pneumonia in children.
*12:30.840- 12:35.980* :  Other countries, including the UK and the US, saw similar surges in flu-like illnesses,
*12:36.380- 12:38.500* :  pandemic restrictions were lifted.
*12:38.500- 12:44.860* :  The WHO said it was unclear whether the outbreak and the overall increase in respiratory infections
*12:44.860- 12:50.220* :  previously reported by the authorities in Beijing were linked and has asked for more detailed
*12:50.220- 12:56.260* :  information. Laura Bicca, the largest animals on earth are now making their home in a part of
*12:56.260- 13:00.360* :  the Indian Ocean where they were wiped out by wedding ships decades ago.
*13:01.020- 13:05.880* :  Researchers working around the seashells had already caught a glimpse of a few individual
*13:05.880- 13:12.660* :  blue whales in 2020 and 2021, but an entire year of underwater audio recordings has now revealed
*13:12.660- 13:18.200* :  these weren't just chance encounters. Our science correspondent, Victoria Gill, has been listening in.
*13:22.180- 13:27.660* :  The blue whale is the largest animal to ever exist on the planet and their sounds are very low
*13:27.660- 13:34.600* :  frequency. Just knowing that there is a population out there around the seashells is incredibly exciting.
*13:35.320- 13:40.520* :  Dr. Kate Stafford from Oregon State University was the lead researcher on this recent Indian Ocean
*13:40.520- 13:45.640* :  expedition. Scientists and wildlife filmmakers set out together to discover whether blue whales
*13:45.640- 13:52.540* :  had returned to the waters around the seashells. In the 1960s, Soviet whalers found about 500
*13:52.540- 13:58.000* :  blue whales just to the north of the seashells and killed them all. And so part of the impetus was
*13:58.000- 14:05.940* :  to see blue whales still occur around the seashells. To work out if a population had become
*14:05.940- 14:12.340* :  reestablished here, they fixed underwater microphones to the seabed. We had divers put this down
*14:12.340- 14:19.040* :  and leave it for a year. You can listen underwater 24 hours a day and you're also listening to
*14:19.040- 14:27.120* :  undisturbed animals. Look at this moment, got everything ready and then you just put your headphones
*14:27.120- 14:32.900* :  on and turn the level up because you never know what you're going to hear. Renowned wildlife sound
*14:32.900- 14:38.240* :  recordist Chris Watson was part of the film crew on the trip. He showed me how to catch a sound
*14:38.240- 14:44.700* :  beneath the surface. I can hear the stones on the seabed ab and flow with the current.
*14:46.420- 14:53.820* :  It is quite relaxing. Yeah, quite a good sound. But even with his expert eavesdropping,
*14:53.820- 14:57.100* :  Chris didn't manage to hear blue whales in the seashells.
*14:57.880- 15:06.400* :  With that for a month and I was out every day listening and not once sadly did he hear a blue whale.
*15:07.480- 15:12.900* :  It was Dr Stafford's year-long fixed sound traps that revealed that the whales were there
*15:12.900- 15:19.500* :  communicating when the scientists and filmmakers had all left. Sound travels much further
*15:19.500- 15:25.660* :  and more efficiently underwater than it does in air. So low frequency sounds in particular
*15:25.660- 15:33.680* :  can travel for tens to hundreds of kilometers. Pains taking analysis of that entire year of sound
*15:33.680- 15:40.040* :  picked up the telltale deep calls of blue whales. We heard blue whale sounds roughly six months
*15:40.060- 15:45.160* :  during the year, primarily during March and April. That suggests that the seashells is really
*15:45.160- 15:51.600* :  important for the blue whales. Turns out if you stop killing animals on mass scales, they can recover.
*15:55.280- 16:01.300* :  This is the song of the largest animal on earth. A clip that Chris Watson recorded on a different
*16:01.300- 16:05.600* :  blue whale expedition in Mexico. Depending on what device you're listening to this on,
*16:05.600- 16:13.640* :  it might be too low for your speakers. This really low, deep, consistent pulse, this
*16:18.540- 16:24.340* :  being out on the inky blackness of the sea of Cortes before sunrise. Looking at your
*16:24.840- 16:31.640* :  hydrafront cables disappearing below the surface but then hearing the song of the largest animals
*16:31.640- 16:37.900* :  ever lived being drawn out of those depths was one of the most exciting things I've ever done.
*16:43.720- 16:49.660* :  That report was by Victoria Gill. Still to come on this podcast.
*16:57.900- 17:02.660* :  Dr. Who at 60, we look at the timeless appeal of the traveling time mode.
*17:09.780- 17:14.480* :  Food is incredibly important in the world. It's about survival, culinary heritage,
*17:14.480- 17:20.540* :  culture and tradition. Different relationships across the world. The food chain from the BBC
*17:20.540- 17:26.620* :  World Service examines the business, science and cultural significance of food. If this kind of
*17:26.620- 17:33.080* :  food is lost, a community will lose its identity. And what it takes to put food on your plate.
*17:33.420- 17:38.300* :  This is an incredible journey. Search for the food chain wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:41.840- 17:45.260* :  It was a victory that no one saw coming. Not even the winner himself.
*17:45.260- 17:51.400* :  Get the Elders, the veteran anti-Islam populist politician. It's celebrating his freedom party
*17:51.400- 17:56.280* :  winning the most seats in the snap general election in the Netherlands. He'll now have to persuade
*17:56.280- 18:02.020* :  other parties to join him in a coalition, not an easy task. Before the vote, the three other
*18:02.020- 18:07.500* :  big parties ruled out taking part in a wilderness-led government because of his controversial policies.
*18:08.180- 18:12.800* :  Builders told the BBC that he'd be willing to find compromises in order to get some partners.
*18:41.220- 18:44.080* :  Our correspondent in the Hague, Alan Holligan, told us more about it.
*19:07.960- 19:14.080* :  Critics call him a cuddly fascist the way he has performed. He says, in fact, he is prepared to
*19:14.080- 19:18.240* :  govern on behalf of all of the Dutch people. When I spoke to him, I spoke to him just after the
*19:18.240- 19:25.640* :  TV debate. And he was saying, yes, I have a nexit. I wanted to take the Netherlands out of the EU,
*19:26.020- 19:30.600* :  but what I want is a referendum and I understand in Dutch society. There's not a mood for that
*19:30.600- 19:35.500* :  across the population. So he's really reigned in on that. And I spoke to him just after he'd cast
*19:35.500- 19:41.040* :  his vote here in the Hague yesterday. And at that point, when I said, what would you be like as
*19:41.480- 19:48.220* :  Prime Minister? He had to take a moment because I think even for him, this result is beyond his
*19:48.220- 19:52.940* :  wildest dreams. And when he gave his victory speech, it looked as though he had tears in his eyes.
*19:53.200- 19:58.220* :  It was a rather empty room, though, because we, all of the journalists, had headed to the
*19:58.780- 20:02.760* :  Conservative Liberal VVD party, where they are not celebrating.
*20:02.760- 20:08.760* :  Well, the strong show for Git Vilders and his freedom party does follow a wider trend in Europe,
*20:08.780- 20:13.880* :  where plenty of other political parties described as far right have either taken power or have
*20:13.880- 20:18.620* :  a good chance of doing so. I discuss this with our Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss.
*20:19.460- 20:23.500* :  Well, a lot of people say, yes, that it's happening across the continent, certainly in large parts
*20:23.520- 20:28.620* :  of it. I mean, just look who's been congratulating Headvilders. One of the first was the Hungarian
*20:28.620- 20:34.360* :  Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, shares his hostility to immigration to Islam. And he said that this
*20:34.360- 20:40.060* :  victory by Headvilders showed that there was a winds of change passing through Europe.
*20:40.680- 20:44.980* :  Then we had the French long-term presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, similar ideology.
*20:44.980- 20:51.300* :  And she said that this victory showed that there was still hope for change in Europe.
*20:51.780- 20:55.100* :  I think she might be thinking of herself, that she's hoping to become the president after
*20:55.100- 20:58.660* :  the next election in France. And a lot of people think she can make it.
*20:59.320- 21:04.140* :  An interesting country is Germany next door to France, next door to Holland. And there,
*21:04.140- 21:08.500* :  a lot of people always said, well, the far right will never do well in Germany because of its
*21:08.500- 21:14.480* :  history, because of its experience of Nazism. Well, the AFD has done very well there recently.
*21:14.480- 21:20.400* :  In some parts of Germany, it's the leading party, also standing on a ticket of opposing immigration,
*21:20.400- 21:26.120* :  strongly opposed to Islam. And then we've got another country with a history of fascism. And
*21:26.120- 21:32.020* :  that's Italy. In fact, the Brothers of Italy party is a direct descendant of the wartime fascist
*21:32.020- 21:37.820* :  party, led by Mussolini. Their leader, Georgi Maloney, has become Prime Minister. So that's part
*21:37.820- 21:43.020* :  of a trend which many see spreading across the continent. So why is the far right doing well at the
*21:43.020- 21:47.440* :  moment? Well, one obvious answer is immigration. All these parties are opposed to immigration.
*21:47.440- 21:52.840* :  And immigration has reached record numbers, hundreds of thousands crossing the Mediterranean
*21:52.840- 21:58.440* :  or crossing by land from Turkey. And another problem, though, is that this is cause problems for
*21:58.740- 22:02.780* :  for the European Union, which is seen as inadequate for dealing with this by some people.
*22:03.260- 22:07.980* :  And a lot of those right-wing parties are also Eurosceptic. Don't like the European Union.
*22:08.320- 22:12.900* :  So that has also sustained them. But I think we've got to speak about something more general.
*22:12.900- 22:17.440* :  These parties are not just right-wing. They're usually described as populist, strong leaders,
*22:17.440- 22:24.000* :  simple messages. Well, Nick, these are difficult times across the world. Lots of conflicts going
*22:24.000- 22:28.720* :  on. People are scared about climate change, pandemics. There is an appeal in someone who says,
*22:28.720- 22:33.220* :  look, vote for me. I'll stop them building mosques in your town. I'll stop those foreigners
*22:33.220- 22:38.260* :  coming here. And your life will be getting better. Lots of people would be skeptical about whether
*22:38.260- 22:43.120* :  that's a real programme for government. But they'll say that it's certainly very popular with
*22:43.120- 22:47.400* :  voters. Paul Moss. The head of Indonesia's anti-corruption
*22:47.400- 22:53.240* :  agency has himself been named as a suspect in a case involving extortion and kickbacks.
*22:53.980- 22:59.640* :  Feli Bahuri has denied he's corrupt. Asia-Pacific editor Mickey Bristo has the details.
*23:00.260- 23:04.420* :  The police said there was enough evidence to link Mr. Feli to corruption at the country's
*23:04.420- 23:08.940* :  Ministry of Agriculture. The former Minister at the department has already been arrested.
*23:08.980- 23:14.760* :  Officers said they'd found foreign exchange transaction documents and half a million dollars
*23:15.280- 23:20.180* :  in connection with the investigation into Mr. Feli, although he's not yet been arrested.
*23:20.920- 23:27.120* :  Until relatively recently, Indonesia's anti-corruption agency was well respected and successful.
*23:27.120- 23:32.080* :  But its potency has been undermined by changes brought in by the current president,
*23:32.080- 23:37.100* :  Jo Kui Do Do. Mickey Bristo. When the European Space Agency
*23:37.100- 23:43.000* :  cut ties with Russia because of the war in Ukraine, it delayed plans for a mission to Mars in 2022
*23:43.000- 23:48.140* :  by six years. Russia had been due to make a key instrument for the Mars rover
*23:48.140- 23:53.520* :  and infrared spectrometer. Now we're hearing that it will be built here in the UK instead
*23:53.520- 23:59.620* :  at Aberystwyth University in Wales. Jonathan Amos is our science correspondent and he told us
*23:59.900- 24:04.240* :  what they're building. When infrared light is something that we can't see,
*24:04.240- 24:09.160* :  the wavelengths of light are a little bit longer than what we can detect. But you can see some
*24:09.160- 24:14.080* :  interesting things in rocks if you look at them with infrared light. There's certain wavelengths
*24:14.080- 24:18.960* :  that will be missing as the sunlight reflects off those rocks and that's tell-tale sign.
*24:19.080- 24:23.340* :  For certain minerals that you might want to chase up and in the case of this rover,
*24:23.340- 24:28.940* :  it's looking to drill below the surface when it gets to Mars to see if there might be life there.
*24:28.940- 24:34.560* :  Either a sort of present life but more likely past life. And so this particular instrument
*24:34.560- 24:40.060* :  envisages, which is Welsh for Rainbow, is going to be critical in finding the right places
*24:40.420- 24:45.440* :  to go drill. It's kind of leading the search if you like for life on Mars when it gets down to the
*24:45.440- 24:49.880* :  surface. So Wales has stepped in. It's not known for being at the forefront of the space race but
*24:50.160- 24:54.780* :  I suppose we've come a long way since it was a two-horse race between the Soviets and the US.
*24:55.440- 24:59.740* :  There's a lot of expertise at Aberystwyth University and they've been doing quite a lot of space
*24:59.740- 25:04.580* :  activity. And actually they've been quite involved in this long-running saga, which is the
*25:04.580- 25:11.320* :  Rosalind Franklin Rover Missions European Space Agency. Missions first approved way back in 2005
*25:12.180- 25:18.160* :  at various missteps, crises, funding, shortfalls and all the rest of it and the latest being
*25:18.160- 25:24.560* :  the Ukraine war and having to split with Russian partners. That's why Aberystwyth is having to
*25:24.560- 25:29.860* :  step in but they've been involved in that project for quite some time working on the main camera
*25:29.860- 25:35.060* :  system and in particular in in calibrating that camera system as well so that when it takes
*25:35.060- 25:39.580* :  pictures of the rocky surface of Mars, you know, they'll have the right colours, they'll know
*25:39.580- 25:43.540* :  precisely what they're looking at. But yes, more broadly, Wales is going into space,
*25:43.540- 25:48.500* :  it's looking to up what it can do in terms of all sorts of missions that are going forward.
*25:49.160- 25:54.440* :  Jonathan Amos. Today marks 60 years since the very first episode of the long-running
*25:54.440- 26:00.700* :  sci-fi BBC series Doctor Who. It's got a huge following worldwide but for those who don't know it,
*26:00.700- 26:06.280* :  the Doctor is a time lord who explores the universe in a time-traveling spaceship called the
*26:06.280- 26:12.760* :  TARDIS and tries to evade his enemy, the Daleks. During its 60 years there have been many
*26:12.760- 26:17.900* :  reincarnations of the Doctor, including one as a woman. Our reporter Paul Hayes has been taking
*26:17.900- 26:23.260* :  a look back at how it all began. BBC Television and now the first of a new series.
*26:27.220- 26:31.680* :  That's the actual original announcement into the very first episode of Doctor Who.
*26:32.000- 26:37.080* :  Broadcast here for the first time in 60 years. The announcement might have given it a bit more
*26:37.080- 26:41.700* :  oomph if he'd known what an historic moment it was but a more restrained mood was understandable
*26:41.700- 26:46.660* :  as the world was still reeling from the shock of the assassination of President Kennedy the day before.
*26:47.380- 26:50.420* :  That event has become indelibly linked with the start of Doctor Who,
*26:50.740- 26:54.820* :  creating all sorts of myths about the show starting 10 minutes late or being the first
*26:54.820- 26:59.600* :  non-news program since it happened. What is true is that the first episode was repeated before
*26:59.600- 27:04.340* :  the second the following week. Something the BBC Radiophonic workshop were probably pleased about
*27:04.340- 27:08.480* :  as it gave another chance for the theme tune they'd created to make a first impression
*27:08.900- 27:11.340* :  without the announcement accidentally talking all over the start.
*27:11.900- 27:16.580* :  Composed by Australian Ron Grayner, it was painstakingly constructed electronically by the
*27:16.580- 27:22.580* :  workshop's Delia Darbyshire. It was a magic experience because I couldn't see from the music how
*27:22.580- 27:29.260* :  it was going to sound and it was just Ron's brilliant oral imagination because when he heard
*27:29.260- 27:35.900* :  the results he was really tickled pink. It's all very interesting. Yes that's very very very
*27:35.900- 27:41.400* :  interesting. William Hartnell there, the first Doctor. The idea for Doctor Who was created
*27:41.400- 27:45.740* :  by two senior members of the BBC drama department, the Canadian Sydney Newman and the
*27:45.740- 27:50.560* :  Scottsman Donald Wilson. Donald Wilson may very well have named the program and he certainly
*27:50.560- 27:54.960* :  strongly believed in its potential writing three weeks before it's debut that we have an
*27:54.960- 28:00.560* :  absolute knockout in this show and there will be no question but that it will run and run.
*28:01.060- 28:05.300* :  Although producer Verity Lambert did later remember that Wilson hadn't thought much of the
*28:05.300- 28:09.720* :  scripts for the second Doctor Who story which introduced a certain race of alien monsters.
*28:10.200- 28:17.740* :  The quality is poor. Donald hated it and he said to us you can't put this out this is terrible
*28:18.200- 28:23.100* :  so we did it and of course it was this huge and immediate success and to give Donald his due
*28:23.360- 28:27.960* :  when it was clear that it was a great success he called us in and said well I obviously don't
*28:27.960- 28:31.460* :  know anything about this and you do know what it was I won't bother to interfere again.
*28:31.780- 28:37.020* :  Now as Doctor Who hits 60 time for a whole new beginning once again but what might the original
*28:37.020- 28:42.220* :  Doctor William Hartnell have made of it all Jessica Carney wrote a biography of him and also
*28:42.220- 28:49.420* :  happens to be his granddaughter. Gosh well it's a bit mind boggling isn't it I think he would have
*28:49.420- 28:55.540* :  been throttled I think he knew that they were on to a good thing but how can anyone know what
*28:55.540- 29:00.160* :  their legacy is going to be? No one will know that. I mean he would have been thrilled that the love
*29:00.160- 29:04.740* :  and care he put into the performance and the creation of the character should have born such fruit.
*29:09.080- 29:14.380* :  Certainly isn't that is the very first Doctor Who William Hartnell ending that report by Paul Hayes.
*29:16.960- 29:20.920* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later on
