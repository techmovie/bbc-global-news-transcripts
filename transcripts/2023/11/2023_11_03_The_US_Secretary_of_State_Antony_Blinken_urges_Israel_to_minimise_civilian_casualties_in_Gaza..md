*00:49.920- 00:53.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:55.520- 01:01.780* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 14 hours GMT on the 3rd of November 2023, these are our main stories.
*01:02.280- 01:07.460* :  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken urges Israel to protect Palestinian civilians.
*01:08.120- 01:12.020* :  The leader of Hezbollah has been making his first public statement about the
*01:12.020- 01:19.060* :  Hamas attacks of October the 7th and the UN says more than 25,000 people have been displaced
*01:19.060- 01:27.640* :  by the upsurge in fighting in Myanmar. Also in this podcast concern about immigration
*01:27.720- 01:44.640* :  bolsters support for Germany's far right party and the latest on the escapee hippos from the zoo
*01:44.640- 01:47.240* :  of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar.
*01:51.940- 01:57.620* :  The leader of the Iranian backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon has praised Hamas for its assault on
*01:57.620- 02:02.200* :  Israel last month in which about 1400 people most of them civilians were killed.
*02:02.220- 02:08.440* :  In his first public comments on the conflict Hassan Nasrullah described the actions of Hamas as
*02:08.440- 02:15.540* :  right, wise and just. Hezbollah, which like Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the US
*02:15.540- 02:22.020* :  and other Western countries, is the biggest political and military force in Lebanon and it's already
*02:22.020- 02:28.160* :  clashed with Israeli troops on the border. Hundreds of supporters gathered in a public square in Beirut
*02:28.160- 02:34.300* :  to watch Nasrullah's video address. Our correspondent Yolanda Nell, who's in Jerusalem, was watching.
*02:35.220- 02:41.300* :  This is a big crowd of support for Hassan Nasrullah as he gives a speech. There are people
*02:41.820- 02:48.560* :  with the Palestinian flag, with Lebanese flags, the flags of Hezbollah itself all gathered to
*02:48.560- 02:52.600* :  listen to this speech and actually have to say talking to colleagues around the region. They
*02:52.600- 02:57.940* :  have told me that because this really does have a potentially very big impact, it's extremely
*02:57.940- 03:04.020* :  quiet in many Arab towns and cities as people tune in to hear what Hassan Nasrullah says.
*03:04.480- 03:09.620* :  I mean, he started off quite slowly with lots of flowery language and he's talking about what he
*03:09.620- 03:16.140* :  calls the martyrs of Lebanon and Palestinians. He sends his condolences and blessings also to those
*03:16.140- 03:21.820* :  who have been killed in Gaza and in the West Bank. He talked about what happened on the 7th
*03:21.820- 03:27.000* :  October directly. Lots of accusations have been made that Iran had a leading role in it,
*03:27.000- 03:33.760* :  but he was clear. He's representing a group of horse which is very close to Iran and he said that
*03:34.240- 03:41.680* :  it was an 100% Palestinian initiative and he praised it in that sense. Now he said that this was
*03:42.280- 03:47.720* :  something that had happened in the context of 75 years of the Palestinian people being
*03:47.720- 03:52.380* :  under occupation, of course, 75 years since the creation of the state of Israel that he talked about
*03:52.380- 03:56.680* :  the suffering that Palestinian said been through. Very much he's talking only about the Palestinian
*03:56.680- 04:01.660* :  question in his speech. He said other issues related to Lebanon would have to wait. But what we
*04:01.660- 04:07.300* :  don't have at this moment is any clue about what could be the Lebanese group's involvement,
*04:07.300- 04:12.380* :  you know, how much it might step up its own attacks on Israel. Now what we've seen is kind of more
*04:12.380- 04:18.280* :  tit-for-tat exchanges, although they have escalated in recent days across the border we haven't seen
*04:18.300- 04:26.280* :  has been using its longer-range missiles, experts believe that the group has more than 100,000
*04:26.620- 04:31.820* :  missiles. Some of them really quite precise ones that could potentially be used to try to reach
*04:32.120- 04:38.900* :  all of Israel and key infrastructure if this war was to escalate on the second front across
*04:38.900- 04:43.680* :  Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Yuland, now the US Secretary of State,
*04:43.680- 04:48.440* :  Antony Blinken, is in Israel again on his second visit to the region in less than a month.
*04:48.900- 04:53.700* :  He said humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza were an important part of his discussions
*04:53.700- 04:59.460* :  with Israeli leaders. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 9,000 people have died in Gaza
*04:59.460- 05:05.920* :  since the 7th of October. At a news conference, Antony Blinken said that Israel had Washington's full
*05:05.920- 05:11.140* :  support to defend itself. I returned to the region to engage in intense diplomacy with our
*05:11.160- 05:17.260* :  partners to try to help ensure that an attack like October 7th never happens again, and in doing so
*05:17.260- 05:23.500* :  that we forge a different future, a very different future for Israelis and Palestinians alike,
*05:23.500- 05:30.060* :  that out of this tragedy emerges a better tomorrow for both peoples and for the region.
*05:30.720- 05:35.520* :  Before leaving Washington, Mr. Blinken said Israel must ensure Gaza's civilians are
*05:35.520- 05:41.960* :  protected, comments he repeated today with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Here's what Mr. Herzog's
*05:41.960- 05:47.100* :  had to say about the steps being taken to warn innocent Palestinians of its upcoming attacks.
*06:17.000- 06:21.980* :  The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says more than 9,000 people have died there
*06:21.980- 06:28.560* :  since the October 7th attacks on Israel. Our correspondent Anna Foster told me more about Mr. Blinken's
*06:28.560- 06:33.920* :  latest trip to the Middle East, starting with his calls for a pause in fighting to allow aid
*06:33.980- 06:39.740* :  to reach Gaza. Still, even now, the amount of aid trucks that are passing through the
*06:39.740- 06:45.760* :  wrap-acrossing from Egypt into Gaza are far smaller, far lower than they would need to be to
*06:45.760- 06:50.860* :  actually meet the needs of the civilian population, many of whom find themselves displaced there at the
*06:50.860- 06:55.800* :  moment. And what do we know about what the Israeli defence force is saying happened in fighting
*06:55.800- 07:01.680* :  overnight? What they're saying now is that they have encircled Gaza City, which is something
*07:02.200- 07:09.680* :  strategically important, because that is very much where Hamas's centre is in Gaza. A lot of
*07:09.680- 07:15.600* :  their command and control infrastructure, some of their very senior operational commanders are
*07:15.600- 07:20.540* :  based in Gaza City. And we've heard from the IDF that their troops on the ground, their armored
*07:20.540- 07:27.640* :  vehicles are all the time targeting and eliminating, they say, terrorist cells. The question is, I
*07:27.640- 07:32.020* :  think now, how long this phase of the operation will take? The Israelis have said throughout
*07:32.020- 07:38.500* :  that this will be a long and difficult war. We don't know how quickly the Israeli defence forces
*07:38.500- 07:44.360* :  will be able to achieve this day-to-day of removing Hamas from Gaza. And what do you make of the
*07:44.360- 07:50.960* :  IDF claim that they eliminated a Hamas battalion commander overnight? Well, for the last few days,
*07:50.960- 07:56.360* :  they have been talking about killing these senior Hamas leaders, and it is something they have
*07:56.360- 08:03.380* :  been using in justification for the civilian death toll in some of these attacks and some of
*08:03.380- 08:08.280* :  these airstrikes that we've seen. We know that Onre, the UN agency that looks after Palestinian
*08:08.280- 08:16.280* :  refugees, have said that in the last 24 hours, four of their schools have been hit where people
*08:16.280- 08:22.380* :  are sheltering. Now, Israel has made it very clear they say that Hamas is using Palestinian
*08:22.380- 08:27.520* :  civilians in Gaza as human shields, and they say that because they are taking out these senior
*08:27.520- 08:33.400* :  Hamas commanders, that is their justification for targeting these particular areas. Of course,
*08:33.400- 08:39.060* :  Hamas is most senior leaders. Several of them are out of the country altogether, but Israelis
*08:39.060- 08:45.280* :  is really giving this impression through its regular updates that they are managing to chip away
*08:45.280- 08:51.960* :  Hamas' infrastructure within Gaza. And then, of course, the Rafa crossing, the key vital
*08:51.960- 08:58.860* :  lifeline between Gaza and Egypt, has it reopened today, and if so, is it busy? It appears to be
*08:58.860- 09:03.260* :  open again for a third day. There's been a fresh list of people that have been published around
*09:03.260- 09:09.380* :  600 or so, we think, who will be given permission to leave today. Now, it is important to remember that
*09:09.380- 09:15.980* :  these are all people who have dual nationalities or foreign passports. Around seven and a half
*09:16.040- 09:20.540* :  thousand of them, over two weeks, the Egyptians have said, will be given permission to pass through
*09:20.980- 09:25.900* :  the Rafa crossing from Gaza into Egypt on the day that their name appears on the list, that will
*09:25.900- 09:31.180* :  give them passage through the crossing. But, of course, that is only a very, very tiny fraction of
*09:31.180- 09:38.520* :  the more than two million civilians who remain inside Gaza without the opportunity or the means to
*09:38.520- 09:44.920* :  leave, as this wall goes on. Anna Foster. Now, there's probably no American diplomat who knows more
*09:44.920- 09:50.300* :  about the Middle East than Dennis Ross. As special envoy, he was one of Washington's key Middle East
*09:50.300- 09:56.120* :  negotiators in the Oslo peace process, the closest that the Israelis and Palestinians have perhaps
*09:56.120- 10:04.800* :  come to a peace agreement. He's also served under President George Bush Jr. and Barack Obama.
*10:05.440- 10:10.520* :  My colleague Victoria Oon Kunda asked him what he thought Anthony Blinkenet is hoping to achieve
*10:10.520- 10:17.040* :  during his latest trip to a troubled region. I think the thrust will be on trying to understand
*10:17.040- 10:22.960* :  the combination of where the military strategy is right now, what it has achieved, how it relates
*10:22.960- 10:29.120* :  to the ultimate objectives of destroying the Hamas military infrastructure and also the political
*10:29.120- 10:35.940* :  command control so that Hamas can't be the ruler of Gaza when this is over, but also how does one
*10:35.940- 10:44.800* :  in this at the same time, how does one create enough safe areas and enough corridors so that the
*10:44.800- 10:51.760* :  Palestinian population with in Gaza can be, have their needs addressed in circumstances that
*10:51.760- 10:59.060* :  are obviously profoundly difficult. Can Hamas be defeated and eradicated without, you know,
*10:59.060- 11:06.520* :  killing the, would seem more loss of civilian lives? Well, I think the term eradication is probably
*11:06.520- 11:13.580* :  one that shouldn't be used. And I say that because not every single person who identifies with Hamas
*11:13.580- 11:22.620* :  or every single person who may be a member of Hamas is going to disappear, going to be destroyed,
*11:22.620- 11:32.080* :  going to be killed. What I think the objective is is to destroy the very significant military
*11:32.940- 11:38.860* :  infrastructure, much of the tunnel system which protects Hamas fighters and leaders but not
*11:38.860- 11:45.440* :  the Palestinian public. It is ironic that 300 square miles of tunnels have been built underground
*11:45.440- 11:51.160* :  at enormous expense, but they're not for any Palestinian civilians. I think that's you're looking
*11:51.160- 11:56.720* :  at that. You're looking at getting the leadership. You're not talking about the eradication of Hamas.
*11:56.720- 12:02.700* :  You're talking about weakening Hamas to the position where someone else about some kind of
*12:02.700- 12:07.840* :  international administration on an interim basis can be established with the support of the
*12:07.840- 12:12.740* :  international community, with the support of leading Arab states who likely have a stake in coming
*12:12.740- 12:18.820* :  into help rescue Palestinians from what Hamas has subjected them to. So I think that's the way
*12:18.820- 12:23.240* :  to think about it. Now you asked the question, can it be done with no civilian casualties?
*12:23.740- 12:32.380* :  Obviously, sadly no, tragically no, because Hamas has so embedded itself in civilian areas and
*12:32.380- 12:37.140* :  basically holds its population hostage, not just hostages. It is taken.
*12:38.740- 12:44.000* :  Do you think that there is a way forward looking maybe through diplomatic process?
*12:45.820- 12:50.280* :  Look, there clearly are a range of different kinds of options that can be pursued even now.
*12:51.200- 13:01.020* :  One could be the idea of the Hamas leadership leaves. They release all the hostages.
*13:02.060- 13:10.240* :  They leave Gaza. An international trusteeship effectively is established.
*13:11.160- 13:19.380* :  UN mandate is created for that. You allow Palestinian technocrats to help manage that civil
*13:19.380- 13:26.900* :  administration. You get Arab and non-Arab forces to come in to provide security. You create a
*13:27.100- 13:32.920* :  structure for massive reconstruction. You create a future for Gaza where it's completely
*13:32.920- 13:38.540* :  demilitarized and returned for a massive reconstruction program. There are. There's a pathway
*13:38.540- 13:47.720* :  here. It's hard to pursue. It's along as Hamas remains in control of Gaza. Without if Hamas is
*13:47.720- 13:53.900* :  no longer in control of Gaza, then all sorts of possibilities, I think, avail themselves and
*13:53.900- 13:59.860* :  active diplomacy can help us get there. Former Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross.
*14:00.900- 14:07.560* :  Now the United Nations says more than 25,000 people have been displaced across Myanmar by intense
*14:07.560- 14:12.720* :  fighting between the ruling military and ethnic insurgents in the northeast. Last week,
*14:12.720- 14:17.100* :  an alliance of three rebel groups launched a military operation in Myanmar's northern
*14:17.100- 14:23.240* :  Shan State. Jonathan Head reports. More than a week after the ethnic insurgents began their attack
*14:23.240- 14:28.640* :  over a wide area of northern Shan State, the Myanmar military has been unable to mount an
*14:28.640- 14:34.020* :  effective response. With many of its troops killed or forced to surrender, it's relied on
*14:34.020- 14:39.960* :  air strikes and artillery, forcing thousands to leave their homes. But it's been unable to stop
*14:39.960- 14:45.520* :  the insurgents from overrunning dozens of positions and cutting the two main roads to the border
*14:45.520- 14:51.440* :  with China, through which half of the country's overland trade passes. This is the most serious
*14:51.440- 14:56.300* :  military setback suffered by the hunter, which seized power two and a half years ago.
*14:57.000- 15:03.040* :  It's been inflicted by ethnic armies, which until now had largely stayed out of the wider conflict
*15:03.040- 15:08.840* :  between the military and a broad-based opposition movement. The insurgents say they now share
*15:08.840- 15:14.040* :  the goal of overthrowing the military government. In this operation, they've been supported by
*15:14.040- 15:19.880* :  hundreds of volunteer fighters from other parts of Myanmar. They also say they want to shut down
*15:19.880- 15:24.740* :  the scam centers, which have proliferated along the border, in which thousands of foreign
*15:24.740- 15:30.260* :  nationals have been held and forced to work. The government of Thailand says it's trying to
*15:30.260- 15:36.540* :  rescue around 160 of its own citizens who were in one of these centers and are now trapped in a
*15:36.540- 15:45.300* :  town which is being besieged by the insurgents. Jonathan Head. Still to come on this podcast,
*15:45.300- 15:51.680* :  a high-profile trial ends with a conviction, worrying news for the future from one of the world's
*15:51.680- 15:57.080* :  richest men. But before we move on, let's get news of this weekend's happy pod with Andrew Peach.
*15:57.740- 16:02.180* :  Yes, there's a musical theme this week with a Ukrainian refugee who wrote a piece of music to
*16:02.180- 16:07.400* :  cheer up a colleague, which then went viral, also the band that walked between schools of their
*16:07.400- 16:12.880* :  gigs carrying their instruments on their backs. There's news from Brazil of a vaccine for
*16:12.880- 16:19.060* :  cocaine addiction, a new type of seal in Greenland, and two incredible young people, a six-year-old
*16:19.060- 16:25.360* :  girl in China who can do a Rubik's Cube in six seconds, and a 17-year-old robotics expert from India
*16:25.620- 16:30.420* :  who could transform the lives of people with Parkinson's disease. Join me, Andrew Peach,

*17:15.740- 17:20.420* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*17:20.420- 17:25.620* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announced they'd be raising
*17:25.620- 17:30.800* :  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*17:31.080- 17:36.080* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*17:55.760- 18:02.660* :  On Thursday, the entrepreneur, now artificial intelligence or AI is meant to make our lives
*18:02.660- 18:08.920* :  better and easier. On Thursday, the entrepreneur Elon Musk said he could see a time when people
*18:09.180- 18:12.320* :  no longer had to work because AI would do all the jobs.
*18:13.520- 18:18.240* :  There will come a point where no job is needed. You can have a job if you want to,
*18:18.240- 18:23.780* :  to have a job for sort of personal satisfaction, but the AI will be able to do everything.
*18:24.440- 18:28.320* :  Mart experts have warned that while millions of people are benefiting from it,
*18:28.320- 18:33.380* :  others are losing out because they don't speak English. They say most AI systems,
*18:33.380- 18:37.560* :  which are designed in Western countries and are biased towards the English language,
*18:37.560- 18:43.620* :  don't take into account other languages and cultures. Our correspondent, Joe Tidy, told me more.
*18:44.200- 18:48.360* :  Well, AI is trained on open information that's usually found on the internet.
*18:48.920- 18:53.920* :  A computer program will take in every single piece of data it can, and the internet is largely
*18:53.920- 18:59.560* :  English language written. That means that the models that are made in AI, particularly the likes of
*18:59.560- 19:06.180* :  chat GPT and Bard and Lambda, they are tools that allow you to put a question in and get a response
*19:06.180- 19:11.960* :  that's usually very human like and sometimes quite accurate. But of course, if the data that's
*19:11.960- 19:16.160* :  going in is mainly English language, that means what you're getting out is going to be
*19:16.600- 19:21.940* :  leaning heavily towards English language, resources and information. And because of that,
*19:21.940- 19:25.220* :  there's been lots of studies that have been done saying that if you're a non-English speaker,
*19:25.220- 19:31.620* :  you are getting a worse product. And of course, it means that this information fails to reflect
*19:31.620- 19:36.280* :  other languages and cultures. Yeah, that's right. There was a recent study done by a
*19:36.280- 19:41.020* :  machine learning scientist called Yeni Jen and she put in in 16 different languages,
*19:41.020- 19:45.840* :  mass problems. And she found that if you ask in English language, then you're likely to get
*19:45.840- 19:49.840* :  answers that are three times more accurate than other answers. And then there are other
*19:50.260- 19:54.420* :  languages that are what we call well-resourced as well. So there's lots of information and data,
*19:54.760- 19:59.820* :  for example, German or Spanish. But if you go down the list of how well-resourced the language is,
*20:00.160- 20:05.080* :  so for example, Amharic or Burmese, the answers you're getting to these mass problems are either
*20:05.580- 20:10.680* :  complete nonsense, or they just simply cannot do them. Is it because most of technology and
*20:10.680- 20:15.160* :  technology companies are based in the United States that this has happened? It's definitely a
*20:15.160- 20:19.820* :  contributing factor, but the main problem here is that the lack of other languages on the internet,
*20:20.320- 20:26.500* :  although English language is only spoken by about 16% of the population, about 65% of the websites
*20:27.540- 20:32.900* :  is in English. And English is described as an extremely high-resourced language. Then you've
*20:32.900- 20:37.760* :  got other ones which are high-resourced, so Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, and Russian,
*20:38.200- 20:43.360* :  and Arabic. They are well-resourced. So even if you had a company that wasn't in Silicon
*20:43.360- 20:47.560* :  Valley, you'd be able to make a large language model that's pretty good. But when you go down the
*20:47.560- 20:54.060* :  list all the way down to say, Zulu or Haitian Creole or Swahili, you just simply can't make a
*20:54.080- 20:58.900* :  large language model that's going to be as effective and as economical as you can if you're building
*20:58.900- 21:04.200* :  in English. There's also the argument and this was put out by the centre of democracy and technology,
*21:04.820- 21:08.400* :  but there just isn't the incentive. If you're a Silicon Valley company, all the money is in
*21:08.400- 21:12.820* :  the Western world and Northern Hemisphere, so you wouldn't necessarily try and make your
*21:12.820- 21:16.720* :  large language models effective and better for other people who don't speak English.
*21:17.060- 21:22.220* :  It is for now, but we all know that big countries like India and China are looking to dominate
*21:22.220- 21:25.520* :  in the future. So are they doing anything to change this?
*21:25.760- 21:29.440* :  Yeah, and I think it's really interesting. We're seeing this race around the world because people
*21:29.440- 21:33.500* :  are kind of waking up to this and governments are waking up to the fact that the models from Silicon
*21:33.500- 21:38.500* :  Valley just aren't cutting the mustard, so they're building their own. China has got already a huge,
*21:38.500- 21:45.260* :  really successful tech sector and they've worked very hard to build their own Chinese language first
*21:45.260- 21:50.100* :  AI models and that's going very well for them. India has got a big problem because India is,
*21:50.100- 21:55.360* :  as you say, a growing power in the world, but they've got dozens of languages and there is this
*21:55.360- 22:00.300* :  really, really poor resourcing of the information on the internet. So what we're seeing is some
*22:00.300- 22:04.960* :  interesting initiatives like the Bashadana initiative where they're asking people to volunteer to
*22:04.960- 22:11.380* :  use their own language skills to translate bits of text or bits of podcasts to try and build up
*22:11.380- 22:16.260* :  that database of different Indian languages to help them build their own AI systems from that,
*22:16.840- 22:21.000* :  but it's this amount in decline because of course there's just such a difference in
*22:21.000- 22:24.740* :  resourcing when you've got something like English, which is just absolutely everywhere.
*22:25.280- 22:30.400* :  I was speaking to Joe Tidey. He was once called the King of Crypto, but last night in New York,
*22:30.400- 22:35.480* :  Sam Bankman Freed was found guilty of fraud and money laundering. For more insight, this time
*22:35.480- 22:40.240* :  yesterday on Global News Podcast, we brought you an interview with Michael Lewis who's written a book
*22:40.240- 22:46.220* :  on the young entrepreneur who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. A few hours later,
*22:46.220- 22:52.260* :  Bankman Freed has been convicted on seven counts. It follows a five-week trial that dug deep into
*22:52.260- 22:57.920* :  how one of the biggest crypto exchanges and its sister trading company collapsed about a year ago.
*22:58.460- 23:03.320* :  The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damien Williams gave this statement to
*23:03.320- 23:08.780* :  reporters after the verdict. Sam Bankman Freed perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds
*23:09.080- 23:14.760* :  in American history. A multi-billion dollar scheme designed to make him the King of crypto.
*23:16.200- 23:21.760* :  Here's the thing, the cryptocurrency industry might be new. The players like Sam Bankman Freed
*23:21.760- 23:28.720* :  might be new. But this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption, is as old as time, and we have no
*23:28.720- 23:33.940* :  patience for it. Our business correspondent, Aaron Delmore in New York told my colleague,
*23:33.940- 23:40.920* :  Charlotte Gallagher, more about him. Sam Bankman Freed was the founder of FTX, which became the world's
*23:40.920- 23:45.260* :  second largest crypto exchange, a trading platform where people could change their regular
*23:45.260- 23:50.240* :  dollars and pounds into cryptocurrencies and trade them. He also founded an investment fund called
*23:50.240- 23:57.160* :  Alameda Research, and he was wealthy. His net worth was up to $26 billion. Right now, he's only age
*23:57.160- 24:02.300* :  31. He was on the cover of magazines, he was hobnobbing with celebrities, and getting them to
*24:02.300- 24:07.620* :  endorse his deals and advertisements and his companies and advertisements. And then his cryptocurrency
*24:07.620- 24:14.220* :  company, the exchange and hedge fund collapsed in the fall of 2002, and thousands of XTF customers
*24:14.220- 24:20.500* :  were left without billions of dollars. And he's been found guilty in court. He's always protested
*24:20.500- 24:25.080* :  his innocence, but he's been found guilty. Yep, he maintained his innocence throughout this trial,
*24:25.080- 24:30.180* :  pleading not guilty to all seven charges. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all seven,
*24:30.180- 24:36.660* :  and the prosecution framed it to the jury as Sam Bankman Freed is guilty of stealing customer
*24:37.820- 24:43.240* :  funds and of spending the money on investments and real estate purchases and political donations
*24:43.240- 24:49.080* :  and to pay back lenders to his crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. And he's also lied to investors
*24:49.080- 24:52.480* :  and to lenders. These are the charges that he was found guilty of today.
*24:52.820- 24:57.640* :  And this case has rocked the cryptocurrency world because people who are into crypto are really
*24:57.640- 25:02.300* :  into it, aren't they? And may have lost money. Remember, there were thousands of people who traded
*25:02.300- 25:07.920* :  on FTX and when FTX went bankrupt, it did not have customer funds safeguarded. That's at the
*25:07.920- 25:12.540* :  heart of the story here that customers lost the money that they entrusted to FTX and that they
*25:12.540- 25:17.100* :  had told through the terms of service were protected. And yes, it did rock the industry. Cryptocurrency
*25:17.100- 25:24.100* :  soared to heights in 2021 and then fell in 2022. And we have seen here calls for more regulation
*25:24.100- 25:28.140* :  in the crypto industry. And that's something that we expect to hear more of now that this trial
*25:28.140- 25:33.500* :  has concluded. What kind of sentence would you expect for this sort of crime? We'll find out exactly
*25:33.500- 25:38.860* :  on March 28th. That's when the judge has sent to hear the sentencing hearing date. But Sam
*25:38.860- 25:43.860* :  Macman freed faces decades in prison and potentially a lifetime sentence. He's been found guilty
*25:43.860- 25:49.840* :  on all seven charges and the statutory maximum for five of those charges are 20 years each for the
*25:49.840- 25:56.300* :  other two five years. That's a maximum of 110 years in prison. We do expect the judge to come
*25:56.300- 26:00.860* :  in below that judges often come in below the statutory maximum, but that's a life sentence.
*26:01.820- 26:07.620* :  Aaron Delmore speaking to my colleague Charlotte Gallagher. People traffickers face tougher sentences
*26:07.660- 26:13.120* :  as part of a crackdown on illegal migration under new proposals put forward by the German
*26:13.120- 26:19.020* :  government. The tough line follows gains by the far-right AFD alternative for Deutschland party
*26:19.020- 26:25.360* :  in regional elections. Our Berlin correspondent Jessica Parker reports from the eastern state of
*26:31.380- 26:36.700* :  Saxony. Just inside Germany, police are looking for something. Can you open the trunk for me?
*26:36.960- 26:43.480* :  It's the hunt for human traffickers and their desperate cargo. The number of people caught
*26:43.480- 26:51.520* :  entering Germany illegally this year is set to be the highest since 2016. Two hours west we're on
*26:51.520- 27:00.420* :  Saxony's southern border with the Czech Republic. Our rainy Tuesday night 40 to 50 locals have gathered
*27:00.420- 27:07.060* :  in Hermstorf village square. Speakers voice anger that nearby apartments might be used to house
*27:07.060- 27:16.300* :  migrants. Anya is in the group. For me, the young migrants who come here, they are armies. I feel
*27:16.300- 27:23.140* :  so powerless. We as a people are the solution, but we need the rest to wake up too.
*27:23.360- 27:30.020* :  Just 10 minutes from Hermstorf, the pull of Germany is strong. I get by my hiking bag,
*27:30.020- 27:37.380* :  they cross the river and they start the trip. Mohamed Abduim lives in an old youth hostel with
*27:37.380- 27:46.060* :  around 50 other Syrians. Mohamed has successfully sought asylum. Men like him come here to build a life
*27:46.060- 27:52.060* :  he says, not detract from the lives of others. Everyone you have a dream coming here,
*27:52.060- 27:59.980* :  everyone he's dreaming about, about his children, about his, his, his, uh, a saving place to make,
*27:59.980- 28:10.640* :  to make really family. When, when, uh, are you okay? Uh, I'm okay. I'm okay. I just, uh, I lost
*28:10.640- 28:17.640* :  much friend. I lost, I lost my age. Mohamed left Syria nearly a decade ago before making his way
*28:17.640- 28:26.200* :  through Turkey, the Balkans and other EU countries. He's an energetic man, but clearly also tired.
*28:28.460- 28:35.820* :  Up the road, families race down at a boggenride in Altenberg town. It looks idyllic, but the local
*28:35.820- 28:41.940* :  mayor from the Christian Democrat Party is uneasy. New arrivals, but a strain on services Marcus
*28:41.940- 28:53.480* :  Wiesenberg says, while the people smugglers keep getting through. Sometimes 50 migrants a day in
*28:53.480- 28:59.380* :  this small spot on the map, that concerns people. Occasionally they find sleeping bags and campfires
*28:59.380- 29:07.140* :  in the woods. Have they are worried for their children? Are you worried that this issue will
*29:07.960- 29:14.920* :  drive more voters, more people towards AFD alternative for Deutschland? Yeah.
*29:19.280- 29:25.280* :  Alternative for Deutschland, far right, anti-immigration party, but's polling ahead of the three
*29:25.280- 29:30.540* :  governing parties. Migration has, of course, sparked furious debate here before. Remember,
*29:30.540- 29:36.140* :  in 2015, when Angela Merkel allowed in a million people. Germany's still absorbing big numbers.
*29:36.140- 29:42.040* :  It's taken more than a million Ukrainians, and it's actively trying to attract skilled foreign
*29:42.040- 29:47.600* :  workers because of acute labour shortages, but it's the rise in uncontrolled illegal migration
*29:47.660- 29:52.980* :  that's causing Berlin and the EU a huge political headache.
*29:54.020- 29:59.700* :  Just Parker reporting. Now, if you had to ponder the environmental problems facing Latin America,
*30:00.360- 30:06.240* :  wild hippos would probably not come instantly to mind. And yet, the government of Colombia has
*30:06.240- 30:11.860* :  been trying for years to contain its own hippo population, most recently announcing a cull,
*30:11.860- 30:17.940* :  and it all started with the drugs kingpin Pablo Escobar, the newsrooms Peter Goffin reports.
*30:18.460- 30:24.920* :  Pablo Escobar built a billion-dollar empire of crime and bloodshed in the 1980s and 90s.
*30:25.400- 30:30.420* :  His Medellin cartel was, at one time, the world's biggest supplier of cocaine.
*30:31.060- 30:34.920* :  Its members are believed to have murdered more than 4,000 people.
*30:35.760- 30:41.440* :  But Escobar fancied himself a hero of Colombia's working classes. At his luxury ranch,
*30:41.440- 30:47.320* :  he built a kind of theme park and zoo, where, for free, members of the public could see elephants,
*30:47.320- 30:54.300* :  giraffes, rhinos, and hippos. When Escobar was killed in a shootout with police in 1993,
*30:54.300- 31:01.160* :  his assets, including the menagerie, were seized by the authorities. But not before, some of the
*31:01.160- 31:08.040* :  hippos escaped. They moved a lot and they used the rivers as highways so they could move kilometers
*31:08.040- 31:14.680* :  in one day. Carlos Valderama is a vet who grew up nearby. He spoke to the BBC last year.
*31:24.500- 31:30.760* :  By the 2000s, people were reporting strange, hulking creatures in and around the Magdalena river,
*31:30.760- 31:36.980* :  one of Colombia's main waterways. Dr. Valderama was called into sterilize one of the hippos about
*31:36.980- 31:45.560* :  12 years ago. Another one was killed after it became aggressive. Now, with 166 hippos roaming wild,
*31:45.560- 31:52.720* :  Colombia says it's launching a call. Some of the animals will be euthanized, others sterilized,
*31:52.720- 31:58.580* :  and some will be offered to other countries. Hippos are considered one of the deadliest animals in
*31:58.580- 32:04.760* :  the world. In their native Africa, they kill hundreds of people each year. For Dr. Valderama,
*32:04.760- 32:09.680* :  their presence in Colombia is just another part of Escobar's brutal legacy.
*32:10.240- 32:16.460* :  This is one of many problems that he left us. Unfortunately, I have to live through his time.
*32:16.460- 32:23.620* :  It was a very difficult time for us. The newsrooms Peter Gothen on the plight of the Colombian hippos,
*32:24.020- 32:28.700* :  and I certainly wouldn't mess with them. One of them once took a bite out of my boat.
*32:31.700- 32:35.900* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
