00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.940:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:19.360 - 00:25.600:  I'm Paul Moss and at 1300 hours GMT on Thursday the 27th of July, these are our main stories.
00:25.760 - 00:31.700:  Military officers in Niger look to consolidate power after toppling the president in a coup.
00:31.820 - 00:38.220:  We find out more about Ukraine's stalling counteroffensive and El Salvador's politicians bringing
00:38.220 - 00:48.620:  controversial new measures to curb gang violence. Also in this podcast, we will be ready in the coming
00:48.620 - 00:54.360:  months in the next three to four months to provide Bakuna Faso, Zimbabwe, Marley Somalia,
00:54.360 - 01:00.960:  the Central African Republic and Eritrea, with 25,000 to 50,000 tonnes of grain each.
01:02.000 - 01:05.440:  President Putin says three food is on its way to Africa.
01:11.340 - 01:15.620:  It's a sign of Niger's importance that within hours of a coup being launched there,
01:15.620 - 01:21.000:  political figures from around the world have weighed in calling for democratic rules to be restored.
01:21.000 - 01:26.620:  The United States Secretary of State, the United Nations Human Rights Chief, the European Union,
01:27.140 - 01:32.480:  all want to see the elected president restored to power. The whereabouts of Mohammed Bazoum
01:32.480 - 01:36.720:  are unknown. Other Nigerian politicians have been blocked from reaching the capital's
01:36.720 - 01:42.440:  parliament building by armed soldiers. And the head of Niger's armed forces has now said he
01:42.440 - 01:48.120:  supports the coup. So why does the world care so much about a relatively empty country?
01:48.640 - 01:52.400:  Much of it desert and which makes little contribution to the global economy.
01:53.100 - 01:59.900:  Well, Niger is in a strategically important spot, touching both predominantly Arab North Africa,
02:00.380 - 02:04.120:  but also bordering on West Africa, where Islamic insurgents are prevalent.
02:04.140 - 02:09.620:  It is perhaps for that reason that both the US and France have military bases in Niger.
02:10.160 - 02:14.960:  I spoke with our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross, and started by asking if the coup
02:15.180 - 02:21.000:  now seems to have succeeded. It does appear so, yes. I think there was a period when the
02:21.000 - 02:27.400:  ousted government was sort of clinging on to the idea that possibly the armed forces would not
02:27.880 - 02:31.660:  back those who had carried out the coup. And in fact, the foreign minister had even said
02:32.240 - 02:37.400:  there was this coup bid, but the whole army wasn't involved and appealed to the population to resisted.
02:37.400 - 02:43.660:  But since then, as you say, the head of the armed forces has said in order to avoid bloodshed
02:43.660 - 02:50.100:  between elements of the armed forces, it's put its support behind the whole coup operation.
02:50.160 - 02:54.520:  So it looks as though it's a done deal. And now all the kind of voices around the world
02:54.520 - 02:59.800:  are focused more on trying to get the ousted president release, because we think he's still
02:59.800 - 03:06.200:  being held by the presidential guard. I've seen some people describe him as the last pro-Weston
03:06.200 - 03:11.040:  leader in that region who's happy to support Western powers trying to suppress those Islamic
03:11.040 - 03:16.480:  insurgents. So what is the effect going to be on that fight against Islamic insurgency,
03:16.480 - 03:21.840:  if Mohammed Bazoum is out of the picture? Well, it depends what comes out of this coup and
03:21.960 - 03:29.000:  how long the transition is, whether the people who in charge of the country now have vastly
03:29.000 - 03:34.580:  different views from Mohammed Bazoum and his government. But certainly at the moment,
03:34.580 - 03:40.980:  if you look across the Sahel region, Marley, which is where a lot of the violent extremism
03:40.980 - 03:47.600:  sprang from, it fell out with France. It's now kicking out the UN peacekeeping force.
03:48.100 - 03:52.420:  And there aren't really that many allies for the West that are supposed to be trying to fight
03:52.420 - 03:56.820:  against these Islamist militants. There aren't many allies left. So we'll have to see
03:57.660 - 04:02.980:  what the position is of this new military government that's going to be in charge. And whether
04:02.980 - 04:08.660:  it's going to stick around, as others have in the region, and quite stark to look across the
04:08.660 - 04:14.720:  African map now and see, you know, all the way from Guinea on the Atlantic coast through now
04:14.720 - 04:22.280:  Marley, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Bakingafaso, all of those countries now being run by military men.
04:23.040 - 04:28.400:  Will Ross, I mentioned that the US and France both have military bases in Niger, this being a
04:28.700 - 04:33.780:  strategically important part of the world. But in fact, of course, European and other Western
04:33.780 - 04:38.440:  powers are vying for influence across the African continent, as they always have.
04:39.180 - 04:43.480:  And Thursday sees Russia once again trying to assert its presence on the scene.
04:43.860 - 04:48.840:  Vladimir Putin is hosting a summit of African leaders in his native city of St. Petersburg.
04:49.680 - 04:55.480:  One potential headache for this get together, though, is the issue of food. Russia's invasion of
04:55.480 - 05:01.180:  Ukraine has drastically reduced that country's exports of grain and other crops, causing a worldwide
05:01.180 - 05:06.520:  shortage and prices to rise. Then last week, Russia pulled out of the deal, which had allowed
05:06.520 - 05:12.180:  Ukraine to send food exports through the Black Sea. However, the Russian President has told African
05:12.180 - 05:17.040:  leaders he'll send thousands of tons of free grain to the continent within months.
05:21.520 - 05:26.140:  We will be ready in the coming months in the next three to four months to provide Bakingafaso,
05:26.140 - 05:33.960:  Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, the Central African Republic, and Eritrea, with 25,000 to 50,000 tons
05:33.960 - 05:40.420:  of grain each. And we'll ensure free shipping of this cargo. So, will there be enough to satisfy
05:40.420 - 05:46.660:  African leaders whose populations may now include more hungry mouths? Andrew Harding is our Africa
05:46.660 - 05:54.700:  correspondent, and he's not convinced. The grain issue is messy right now. The African continent
05:54.700 - 05:59.440:  is a whole very dependent on Ukrainian and, to some extent, on Russian grain. There had been a
05:59.440 - 06:03.600:  deal, as you know, through the Black Sea, to allow Ukrainian exports that had been
06:04.480 - 06:09.760:  discontinued after negotiations. But now, the Russians have pulled out and seem to be trying to
06:10.160 - 06:17.220:  essentially blockade Ukrainian grain exports. That's very bad news for African countries, particularly
06:17.220 - 06:21.700:  in places like Somalia where they're facing their famine conditions. The Russians are saying,
06:21.700 - 06:26.160:  look, we'll give you free grain, or at least some free grain, and certainly lots of Russian grain
06:26.160 - 06:32.860:  to make up the shortfall. But the likely impact on global grain prices is going to be to push it
06:32.860 - 06:37.860:  up dramatically, and that is going to affect a lot of people across Africa. So, I think there will
06:37.860 - 06:44.080:  be some pretty difficult discussions in St. Petersburg between President Putin, and certainly some of
06:44.080 - 06:50.180:  the more outspoken African leaders who decide to show up. Andrew Harding, Ukraine's armed forces
06:50.180 - 06:55.580:  tend to talk up their successes, man, like most armies, perhaps play down their difficulties.
06:55.580 - 07:01.060:  But one of the generals in charge of Ukraine's counteroffensive has admitted that so far,
07:01.540 - 07:06.940:  Russia has prevented his troops from advancing quickly. General Alexander Tanovsky said that
07:06.940 - 07:12.500:  Russian forces had created multi-layered minefields and other fortified defensive lines,
07:12.500 - 07:16.880:  which were proving tough even for Western tanks and armored vehicles to cross.
07:17.480 - 07:20.500:  From Ukraine, our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel reports.
07:26.400 - 07:30.600:  Hidden in a forest, evidence of Ukraine's stuttering offensive in the south.
07:32.620 - 07:36.560:  A makeshift repair yard trying to salvage not all Soviet equipment,
07:36.600 - 07:43.720:  but recently denated Western armor, now scarred by battle, including broken tracks and buckle wheels.
07:44.660 - 07:48.680:  Among them, half a dozen U.S. made Bradley's, stopped in their tracks.
07:50.680 - 07:55.300:  This repair yard tells you one of the reasons why Ukraine's been struggling to make advances,
07:56.320 - 07:58.580:  the destruction caused by Russian mines.
08:00.980 - 08:05.360:  And this Bradley, you can see the tracks on one side are completely off, and there's a
08:06.240 - 08:09.660:  blown-off wheel that clearly had a mine, I think. Mine?
08:09.820 - 08:17.480:  Yeah. 47th Brigade is one of Ukraine's new units, largely trained and equipped by the West,
08:18.120 - 08:23.020:  but after several of its leopard tanks and Bradley's were destroyed or damaged in the first days of
08:23.020 - 08:27.880:  the offensive, it's now also using its older, less expensive equipment.
08:29.420 - 08:34.940:  This old T-64 tank was being used last night to clear a Russian minefield not far from here,
08:36.300 - 08:41.480:  and one of the rollers that are designed to set off the mines was completely blown off.
08:42.140 - 08:43.800:  One of the crew members was injured, T.
08:50.640 - 08:53.560:  Most of the advance is having to be conducted by infantry.
08:54.480 - 08:56.900:  It's slow and proving hard to hold ground.
08:59.720 - 09:04.720:  This Ukrainian unit, under fire, had to withdraw when one of their comrades was injured.
09:07.320 - 09:09.900:  It's been tough to watch the battle from the sky, too.
09:10.820 - 09:14.660:  Here building a new drone, the man they called Doc from a reconnaissance unit,
09:15.160 - 09:16.980:  has witnessed a new Russian tactic.
09:21.880 - 09:25.940:  He shows me a video of Ukrainian troops advancing towards a Russian trench.
09:26.880 - 09:29.900:  As soon as they enter, they're met by a massive blast.
09:30.680 - 09:33.240:  The trench was empty, but rigged with explosives.
09:38.680 - 09:40.180:  Ukraine has a new weapon, too.
09:42.260 - 09:43.500:  It's hidden in this tree liner.
09:45.260 - 09:48.880:  You're supplied palladin, self-propelled guns,
09:50.200 - 09:56.480:  which for the first time we're seeing, using cluster munitions against Russian infantry, they say.
09:59.120 - 10:03.160:  The cluster shells scatter scores of small bombs over a wide area,
10:03.700 - 10:07.280:  and an air being used to try to dislodge Russian infantry and artillery.
10:08.140 - 10:13.060:  The Ukrainian general overseeing the struggling southern offensive defended their use.
10:13.960 - 10:18.160:  Alexander Tarnavsky says he's now facing a more difficult enemy.
10:20.660 - 10:22.240:  I don't underestimate the enemy.
10:23.020 - 10:27.380:  They've created all the conditions that prevent us from moving forward quickly,
10:28.160 - 10:31.120:  but their weakness is they don't care about their people.
10:31.820 - 10:37.200:  They don't care about losing 10, 100, or a thousand soldiers in one task,
10:38.140 - 10:39.340:  and this is very bad.
10:41.720 - 10:47.520:  General Tarnavsky says his troops are still advancing, although even he admits its slow work.
10:48.420 - 10:50.980:  He says he still has his main strike force in reserve,
10:52.060 - 10:57.240:  but he's trying to advance where well-prepared Russian defense lines appear to be the strongest.
10:58.280 - 10:59.520:  Jonathan Biel in Ukraine.
11:00.320 - 11:05.420:  And now to a conflict of the past, about 3 million people were killed during the Korean War,
11:05.420 - 11:11.220:  many more injured, but tens of thousands of South Koreans were taken prisoner by the North
11:11.640 - 11:16.700:  and never released. Well, it's 70 years since the Armistice which brought the fighting to an end
11:16.700 - 11:21.320:  with both North and South commemorating the occasion. A so-called responder,
11:21.320 - 11:26.300:  Jim McKenzie, has been talking to one of the few people who managed to escape the North,
11:26.860 - 11:29.280:  and to the relatives of those who never made it home.
11:33.320 - 11:37.620:  At the age of 92, Yide-Bong doesn't relish getting out of bed.
11:38.400 - 11:43.300:  As he re-adjusts his pajamas, his left hand reveals three missing fingers.
11:45.020 - 11:48.740:  Our year of injury is not the result of the war he formed, he tells me,
11:49.320 - 11:54.000:  but from the 54 years he was forced to work in a North Korean coal mine.
11:54.700 - 11:56.640:  It got caught at a coal processing machine.
11:59.320 - 12:05.580:  Lee was one of an estimated 80,000 South Korean soldiers captured by the North during the Korean War.
12:12.620 - 12:16.440:  It's now been 70 years since an Armistice brought an end to the fighting,
12:17.040 - 12:21.260:  but the two sides have never signed a peace treaty, meaning the war lives on,
12:21.640 - 12:25.740:  and tens of thousands of prisoners in North Korea have never been returned.
12:27.640 - 12:32.560:  Mr Lee is one of the very few who managed to plot his own escape.
12:33.000 - 12:36.720:  We give our entire youths to that coal mine. We had no rights.
12:37.380 - 12:39.420:  You must have missed home terribly.
12:43.160 - 12:45.980:  I wouldn't. I was all alone and scared.
12:46.760 - 12:51.320:  At what point did you give up hope that anybody was going to come for you?
12:53.340 - 12:56.880:  North Korea was saying it didn't have any prisoners of war.
12:57.180 - 13:02.000:  It seemed as if the South Korean government didn't want to make any efforts to retrieve us.
13:02.220 - 13:07.940:  In the North, the soldiers and their families were designated outcasts and left to perish in the minds.
13:07.980 - 13:13.840:  It's unknown if any of the prisoners are still alive, but their children remain.
13:16.420 - 13:23.340:  I meet Che IU. She was sick when her father was killed in an explosion at a North Korean mine,
13:24.080 - 13:28.300:  but it wasn't until after his death she learned he was a South Korean soldier.
13:29.200 - 13:32.540:  Suddenly, the years of being beaten at school made sense.
13:33.360 - 13:35.400:  She'd been punished by association.
13:39.500 - 13:45.900:  When I found out I hated him there, she tells me, I blamed him so much for making us
13:46.060 - 13:53.040:  all suffer. Only when she escaped to South Korea did she realize her father was a war hero.
13:54.140 - 13:57.060:  Back at Mr. Lee's and he shuffles through to the living room.
13:57.620 - 14:02.840:  By the time he arrived home, already old and frail, his parents had passed away.
14:03.580 - 14:05.960:  They'd been told their son had been killed in action.
14:10.200 - 14:13.720:  I pity my friends that couldn't come home. The war hasn't ended.
14:14.460 - 14:18.980:  We need to be reunified. We are one people. We cannot be divided.
14:20.940 - 14:26.860:  The absence of peace between the North and South have left Lee and the families of these soldiers
14:27.660 - 14:30.060:  struggling to find peace at their own.
14:31.320 - 14:36.120:  Jean McKenzie and Saul. As the heat wave continues across the Mediterranean,
14:36.160 - 14:39.600:  there's been lots of focus on elderly people as likely victims.
14:40.260 - 14:46.000:  In Italy, bedridden man in his 90s was burned to death in his home, unable to flee from the
14:46.000 - 14:51.680:  approaching wildfires, others, less dramatically, simply die because their bodies can't cope with
14:51.680 - 14:57.420:  the extreme temperatures. But now, the United Nations Children's Agency, Unicef, has warned that
14:57.420 - 15:03.240:  half of all young people in Europe and Central Asia are regularly exposed to severe heat waves,
15:03.240 - 15:07.460:  and they say children are also particularly vulnerable to their effects.
15:08.060 - 15:13.060:  Our correspondent, Imogen Fox, is in Geneva where Unicef is based and took me through what
15:13.060 - 15:18.220:  their new report is saying. Parts of Europe, Switzerland, where I am, the Alpine region,
15:18.220 - 15:24.840:  they are heating up faster than the global average. Parts of Spain, Greece, Italy, parts of
15:24.840 - 15:33.620:  Central Asia. Now, here we are having more heat waves and more often. That means that in this part
15:33.620 - 15:39.960:  of the world, half of all children are now exposed to frequent extreme heat. The average
15:39.960 - 15:45.920:  globally is a quarter of all children, so I think what Unicef is pointing to is the fact that
15:45.920 - 15:50.260:  there's needs to be addressed and the vulnerability of children's health in this extreme heat.
15:50.400 - 15:54.600:  And why is it that children are vulnerable, not just the numbers, but that their health is
15:54.640 - 15:59.460:  particularly vulnerable when it comes to high temperatures? Well, children are smaller.
15:59.780 - 16:07.720:  Their core temperature heats up faster and higher than adults would. And it's when your core
16:07.720 - 16:13.340:  temperature goes up above the average that you start to be vulnerable to things like heat stroke,
16:13.340 - 16:20.120:  to things like strain on your heart. In addition, a dehydrated child will deteriorate.
16:20.120 - 16:24.940:  We see that whenever there's an outbreak of cholera or dire, for example, in refugee camp,
16:24.940 - 16:31.640:  children deteriorate much, much faster. So they are especially vulnerable when the temperature
16:31.640 - 16:38.920:  shoots up above 30, they're getting close to 40 degrees, even here in the Alpine regions of
16:38.920 - 16:45.460:  Europe. They are very, very vulnerable. We see now, even where I live, children being kept indoors
16:45.460 - 16:50.380:  in the hot hours of the afternoon. That's not a life for them. Unicef is saying,
16:50.380 - 16:55.440:  government's health services need to look very hot how they incorporate protecting children's
16:55.440 - 17:02.140:  health into their climate mitigation. Imagine folks, anyone traveling through Taiwan's main airport
17:02.140 - 17:07.460:  this week might have been just a little alarm to find it apparently under attack with planes
17:07.460 - 17:13.820:  and helicoptors sweeping in. In fact, this was just a practice run with the country's armed forces
17:13.820 - 17:19.720:  mocking up an attack by China. But it was just part of a whole series of military exercises
17:19.720 - 17:25.440:  in Taiwan this week, the biggest funnily quarter of a century. They reached their climax today
17:25.440 - 17:30.880:  with a mock invasion of beaches close to the capital Taipei, which were repelled by defending
17:30.880 - 17:37.260:  forces. Our Asia correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes is in Taiwan and watch the invasion take place.
17:43.620 - 17:48.780:  A beach in northern Taiwan is under attack. Invading forces from China have landed
17:48.780 - 17:54.200:  and are attempting to secure a beachhead. But Taiwan's own troops are fighting hard,
17:54.200 - 17:59.720:  the invaders are being driven back. This of course is not a real battle, but a drill.
18:00.200 - 18:04.740:  Designed to show China and the rest of the world that Taiwan is ready and to silence
18:04.740 - 18:11.100:  doubters who say the island has for far too long, not taken the threat from China seriously enough.
18:11.880 - 18:16.980:  Alessio Patelano is professor of war studies at King's College London. He says Russia's
18:16.980 - 18:23.100:  invasion of Ukraine last year has been a massive wake up call for Taiwan. The war in Ukraine
18:23.100 - 18:29.280:  shattered at this fundamental assumption that war is a thing of the past. Once that sort of myth
18:29.280 - 18:36.000:  is shattered, then everything else starts to be re-evaluated. The sense of urgency is being driven
18:36.000 - 18:42.380:  by China's president Xi Jinping. He has described unification of Taiwan with China as inevitable
18:42.460 - 18:49.060:  and has even set a deadline, 2049. Professor Patelano says China is building a military so
18:49.060 - 18:54.240:  overwhelmingly powerful, it believes Taiwan will eventually capitulate without a fight.
18:55.000 - 19:01.080:  But the clock is ticking, and a military attack on the island is Xi Jinping's plan of last resort.
19:22.980 - 19:27.960:  Anger after a hard-line Israeli politician visits one of Islam's holiest signs.
19:33.480 - 19:38.920:  Now, how much freedom and justice would you be prepared to give up on for the sake of security?
19:38.920 - 19:43.800:  That is a very real question for the people of El Salvador, the country's president,
19:43.800 - 19:49.600:  Naib Bukheli, is accused of playing fast and loose with the Constitution. And he's also locked
19:49.600 - 19:55.380:  up thousands of alleged gang members, often on the most flimsy evidence, like having a tattoo.
19:55.380 - 20:01.620:  But the measure seems to be popular. Crime has gone down. And now El Salvador's parliament has
20:01.620 - 20:07.420:  approved legislation that will pave the way for mass prosecutions, huge groups of people being
20:07.420 - 20:13.280:  tried at the same time. A reporter Mimi Swabi told me how this new system will work.
20:14.220 - 20:19.880:  This legislation will basically allow prosecutors to try up to 900 people in one sitting,
20:20.420 - 20:25.040:  as long as they're suspected of being part of the same criminal group, the same criminal gang,
20:25.040 - 20:32.260:  or from the same geographical area in El Salvador. Now these gangs are mainly the MS-13 and their
20:32.260 - 20:40.040:  rivals 18th Street. So the law was passed very easily with 67 votes in favour and only six against.
20:40.060 - 20:46.420:  As lawmakers from President Naib Bukheli's party, his new ideas party, which has a majority
20:46.420 - 20:53.040:  in Congress, so that these measures are going to boost order and efficiency. Will it make any
20:53.040 - 20:58.620:  difference really? That's the big question I think. It's designed or it's aiming to address a
20:58.620 - 21:04.580:  backlog in the legal system. So official figures say that more than 70,000 alleged gang members
21:04.580 - 21:09.960:  have been arrested in the last 16 months. But the majority are still waiting trials. That's about
21:09.960 - 21:15.420:  60,000 roughly at the moment as we speak. There have been opposition politicians and human rights
21:15.420 - 21:21.840:  groups saying that these group trials are a risk of depriving those of a right to a fair trial
21:21.840 - 21:27.280:  and taking away their individual presumption of innocence, something that Bukheli has denied.
21:27.280 - 21:32.480:  So what are the people of El Salvador, I think of this? These tough measures are quite
21:32.480 - 21:38.160:  popular. There's been a significant drop in homicides, in crimes such as extortion and drug
21:38.160 - 21:43.360:  dealing on the streets of El Salvador. So communities who are once terrorised by gangs can't even
21:43.360 - 21:48.060:  leave their homes. A starting to lead somewhat of a normal life again, which as you can imagine,
21:48.060 - 21:53.620:  has gone down really well. But on the other side of that we have international accusations of
21:53.620 - 21:58.880:  human rights abuses by the police and army with overcrowding in this new mega prison,
21:59.400 - 22:04.920:  desing custody, reports of torture, also been reports of police having to meet quotas for
22:04.920 - 22:12.940:  arresting people. Miniswabi talking to Beverly Ochen. It is certainly one way to wind people up
22:12.940 - 22:17.740:  in the Muslim world. Israel's extreme right national security minister, Eta Marben Gavir,
22:18.220 - 22:22.740:  has made a third visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.
22:23.360 - 22:29.380:  This is considered to be one of the holiest sites in Islam, Mr Ben Kavir's presence, a provocation.
22:30.040 - 22:35.420:  But when he toured the site with a security detail, he was recorded saying it was the most important
22:35.420 - 22:44.320:  place for Israelis, who he said needed to show their authority. This day in this place, it is always
22:44.320 - 22:49.960:  important to remember that we are all brothers, right, left, secular, religious, and when a
22:49.960 - 22:55.920:  terrorist looks through the window, he does not distinguish between us. Unity is important. Love of
22:55.920 - 23:01.220:  Israel is important, and this place is the most important place for the people of Israel,
23:01.220 - 23:08.720:  to which we need to return and show our sovereignty. The Kingdom of Jordan has condemned the
23:08.720 - 23:14.880:  visit, describing it as a flagrant violation of international law. Gray numbers of Jewish religious
23:14.880 - 23:19.400:  nationalists are now visiting Al-Aqsa, which is only open to Muslim worship.
23:20.360 - 23:25.140:  Now, when you've climbed one of the highest mountains in the world, most of us would want a
23:25.140 - 23:31.420:  serious break. Time to recover from the aches, pains, and possible injuries acquired along the way.
23:31.880 - 23:38.180:  Not so Christian Harila, from Norway, at Annapolis Guide, Tenjin Shepa, they've just recorded
23:38.180 - 23:45.560:  the fastest ever time for women climbing all 14 of the world's peaks that are over 8,000 metres.
23:46.080 - 23:51.280:  That includes, of course, Mount Everest, but their grand finale was reaching the top of K2
23:51.280 - 23:57.100:  in Pakistan, considered perhaps the hardest of all mountains to climb, and they did all this
23:57.100 - 24:04.960:  in just over three months, as Livbica Pelham reports. Climbing all 14 highest peaks in a few months
24:04.960 - 24:11.240:  is a challenging feat. Around 40 mountaineers have completed it so far. Only a few of them are
24:11.240 - 24:19.360:  women. Scaling Mount K2, the world's second-highest summit at 8,600 metres, is particularly tricky.
24:19.360 - 24:27.680:  Far more difficult than Everest, due to its notoriously fickle weather. It has only been scaled by 425
24:27.680 - 24:35.940:  people, including 20 women, since 1954. This was Miss Harila and her Nepali guide, Tenjin Shepa's
24:35.940 - 24:43.880:  14th peak, which they completed in 92 days. Miss Harila was born in Vazzo, on the barren sea,
24:43.880 - 24:51.000:  in Norway's northernmost reaches, where the highest point is just over 600 metres. She discovered
24:51.000 - 24:57.040:  her passion for climbing only in 2015, when she won a trip to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania,
24:57.040 - 25:03.040:  the 37-year-old, however, struggled to secure sponsors, and subsequently sold her apartment
25:03.040 - 25:09.920:  to fund her quest to climb the highest mountains in the shortest time. In her race to set the record,
25:09.920 - 25:16.600:  Miss Harila had to climb 12 of the highest peaks twice, including Everest, Kanchenjanga,
25:16.600 - 25:22.920:  Lotte and Annapurna. The pair, with the previous record holder, Nirmal Puja from Nepal,
25:22.920 - 25:27.440:  who topped all the peaks in six months and one week in 2019.
25:53.660 - 25:58.980:  I felt we played better than we did in the last game. I was very proud of the second half,
25:58.980 - 26:03.480:  and I think that there's still more to come. It was a good result. We are still in the pool games,
26:03.480 - 26:06.660:  so we've seen him in the final again, and then we will show it at the end of the year.
26:07.140 - 26:11.300:  Go Holland! Yeah, awesome! You fans! They were on their top game today, Ricken.
26:11.940 - 26:17.040:  USA Captain Lindsay Horan came to the rescue of the defending champions, who before this game
26:17.040 - 26:23.260:  had won 13 World Cup matches in a row. In Thursday's other group games, Nigeria's stunned
26:23.260 - 26:29.360:  co-host Australia, beating them three-two in Brisbane, and World Cup debutants Portugal
26:29.360 - 26:37.380:  East Pass Vietnam, 2-0. Now, which famous children's doll do you think has sold out in many
26:37.380 - 26:42.880:  countries? It's, perhaps, obvious, Barbie, the pint-sized pin-up-style plastic toy,
26:43.440 - 26:47.820:  which has had a boost lately from the release of a film by the same name. I'll be at one
26:47.820 - 26:53.640:  with a real live human actress taking the title role. Now, you might think that Barbie's makers
26:53.640 - 26:58.460:  will be popping champagne corks, or maybe to keep in with Barbie's clean living image,
26:58.700 - 27:05.620:  they'll be sipping orange juice. But in fact, the toy giant Mattel has reported a 13% fall in
27:05.620 - 27:10.660:  overall sales in the three months to June. Indeed, the company's been struggling to get toy
27:10.660 - 27:16.000:  sales back to pre-pandemic levels. And as our business correspondent, Marika Oy reports,
27:16.000 - 27:22.120:  Mattel's now hoping that Barbie will help turn its fortunes round after the recent bad news.
27:23.000 - 27:28.960:  Doesn't it feel a bit like we're all living in a Barbie world? We've been talking a lot about how
27:28.960 - 27:35.000:  the movie has done extremely well, a record-breaking debut in cinemas, of course, over the weekend,
27:35.000 - 27:40.020:  and its ticket sales for the first weekend are the highest this year, and in fact the fourth
27:40.020 - 27:47.120:  best ever after two Avengers and one Star Wars movies. Now, Mattel hasn't actually said if the
27:47.120 - 27:53.200:  company can make money directly from the movie, but it is still counting on the movie's popularity
27:53.200 - 27:58.080:  to help drive dull sales for the rest of the year. And when the company managed to purchase
27:58.080 - 28:04.460:  a surprise profit thanks to strong sales of movie-related toys, they've decided to expand its range
28:04.460 - 28:09.860:  for the rest of the year as well. Now, Mattel is also releasing several more movies about its
28:09.860 - 28:15.380:  other brands like Hot Wheels and Poly Pocket over the next few years, creating what the company's
28:15.380 - 28:20.780:  boss calls a Mattel Universe, just like Marvel's Universe, and they're hoping to use the Barbie
28:20.780 - 28:27.380:  movie's success as a template. But also, interestingly, in this earnings report, the man who helped
28:27.380 - 28:32.020:  to revive the Barbie brand at the company's chief operating officer, Richard Dixon,
28:32.020 - 28:38.320:  he's been pushed as the CEO of Gap. So, who knows what kind of impact that might have on Mattel as well.
28:38.800 - 28:39.860:  Marika Oy reporting.
28:43.460 - 28:48.120:  And that's all for us for now, but there will be a new addition of the Global News podcast later.
