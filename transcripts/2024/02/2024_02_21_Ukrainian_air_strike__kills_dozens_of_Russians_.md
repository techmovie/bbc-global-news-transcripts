*01:25.200- 01:26.380* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:26.380- 01:30.340* :  This edition is published in the early hours of first day, the 22nd of February.
*01:30.780- 01:35.520* :  Reports suggest 60 Russian troops may have been killed in a missile strike on a training ground
*01:35.520- 01:39.520* :  in occupied Ukraine. But two years on from the invasion,
*01:39.520- 01:43.220* :  Western officials say Russia's war aims haven't changed.
*01:44.180- 01:47.980* :  As a member of the Israeli war cabinet talks of progress in hostage talks,
*01:47.980- 01:51.780* :  we report on the fallout from a recent rescue operation in Gaza.
*01:52.200- 01:57.360* :  When I woke up after being wounded, I started screaming with pain.
*01:57.800- 02:02.440* :  When this happened, I opened my eyes. I saw my husband in his last breath.
*02:03.240- 02:09.220* :  And Alabama's main hospital halts IVF fertility treatment for fear of being prosecuted.
*02:12.160- 02:16.700* :  Also in the podcast, white tuna fish still have high levels of mercury despite
*02:16.700- 02:20.940* :  50 years of action. And the cancer cells have all gone.
*02:20.940- 02:25.380* :  And so when they check my blood now, all of those blood cells belong to you.
*02:25.680- 02:28.600* :  I would be dead if it wasn't for you. I've got four children.
*02:29.560- 02:32.720* :  Coming face to face with a person who saved your life.
*02:37.780- 02:43.400* :  Nearly two years since it launched its invasion and decade after it annexed Crimea,
*02:43.420- 02:49.320* :  Russia's objective in Ukraine remains the same, to subjugate the whole country.
*02:49.320- 02:55.800* :  However, the Kremlin has no plan on how to do it. That is the latest assessment from Western
*02:55.800- 03:01.140* :  security officials. Russia recently achieved its first major victory in nine months,
*03:01.140- 03:04.280* :  with the capture of the ruined eastern town of Avdivka.
*03:04.660- 03:10.220* :  However, the Russian military has also reported to have lost as many as 60 soldiers on Tuesday,
*03:10.220- 03:14.880* :  and Ukrainian missile strike on a training ground at 70 kilometers to the south.
*03:15.580- 03:19.920* :  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner told me what Western officials have been saying.
*03:20.600- 03:25.920* :  Their assessment is a little overly optimistic in the sense that they say that the sanctions
*03:25.920- 03:30.340* :  are hitting Russia's military industrial complex hard. Okay, true. But the fact is,
*03:30.340- 03:34.840* :  on the battlefield, it's Ukraine that is running out of ammunition and weapons, not Russia.
*03:35.440- 03:38.660* :  They said that we do not believe Russia has a meaningful plan,
*03:38.660- 03:43.380* :  beyond continuing to fight in the expectation that Russian manpower and equipment numbers
*03:43.380- 03:47.620* :  will eventually prevail. I'm sure that's probably true. I mean, Russia has made some
*03:47.840- 03:52.400* :  catastrophic mistakes in the early part of the full-scale invasion in 2022,
*03:52.880- 03:57.760* :  but they have learned from those mistakes. They have built the most formidable lines of defense
*03:57.760- 04:03.200* :  in modern history, the Surovikin line in southern Zaporizia, and they have recently achieved,
*04:03.200- 04:07.720* :  at an almost cost, their most significant battlefield success in the town of Evdivka.
*04:08.280- 04:12.920* :  What the assessment said was that Russia's domestic ammunition production capabilities
*04:12.920- 04:16.280* :  are currently insufficient for meeting the needs of the Ukraine conflict.
*04:16.760- 04:20.180* :  That I think is more of a long-term thing, because in the short term,
*04:20.460- 04:24.060* :  they've got a million shells from North Korea. Okay, they're burning through them pretty fast,
*04:24.060- 04:29.700* :  but they're able to fire five to seven times as many shells a day as the Ukrainians can.
*04:29.940- 04:33.680* :  And there are desperate stories coming from the front lines. I've just been in the Munich
*04:33.680- 04:38.240* :  security summit where I've spoke to Ukrainian MPs who were very downbeat,
*04:38.240- 04:43.120* :  saying, you know, in some cases, our artillery units are down to two shells a day.
*04:43.320- 04:48.020* :  The fact is, they can't fend off Russian advances with what little they've got.
*04:48.020- 04:52.240* :  I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that they think Russia's objective remains the same after
*04:52.240- 04:57.200* :  all that's what Vladimir Putin himself has said, but can Russia take the whole of Ukraine?
*04:57.560- 05:03.000* :  That is not a realistic aim. Every Ukrainian I've ever spoken to says there is no question
*05:03.000- 05:08.160* :  of us surrendering. For two reasons. One is they don't trust President Putin because they think
*05:08.160- 05:12.080* :  that he welched on the Minsk agreement, which guaranteed their sovereignty and their borders.
*05:12.080- 05:16.940* :  And two, the horrific stories that have come out of areas of Russian occupation,
*05:16.940- 05:23.560* :  not just butcher, but places like Hasan, Mary Opol, where ordinary Ukrainians have been
*05:23.560- 05:29.580* :  herded into underground chambers and suffered a pauling torture. The Ukrainians are determined
*05:29.580- 05:35.700* :  to fight on with whatever they've got, but they can't possibly hope to regain much of the territory
*05:35.700- 05:40.700* :  that Russia has taken unless they've got sufficient Western arms. Our security correspondent,
*05:40.700- 05:46.620* :  Frank Gardner. Members of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, have overwhelmingly backed a resolution
*05:46.620- 05:52.860* :  by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, rejecting any unilateral recognition of a Palestinian
*05:52.860- 05:59.200* :  state. The war in Gaza has led to renewed international calls for a two-state solution.
*05:59.200- 06:04.240* :  One Palestinian, one Israeli, though the expectation is that that would be achieved by
*06:04.240- 06:11.260* :  negotiations rather than being imposed. Mr Netanyahu said the vote was unequivocal and unanimous.
*06:11.560- 06:17.220* :  The people of Israel and their elected representatives are united today as never before.
*06:17.220- 06:23.220* :  The Knesset voted overwhelmingly to oppose any attempt to unilaterally impose a Palestinian
*06:23.220- 06:29.440* :  state on Israel. Such an attempt will only endanger Israel and will prevent the genuine peace
*06:29.440- 06:35.240* :  that we all seek. Peace can only be achieved after we achieve total victory over Hamas
*06:35.560- 06:41.160* :  and through direct negotiations between the party's direct negotiations without preconditions.
*06:41.720- 06:47.100* :  However, opposition leader Yeh Lapid said the vote was political spin by Mr Netanyahu,
*06:47.520- 06:52.760* :  shouting at the Prime Minister, there is no single official in the world who offers a unilateral
*06:52.760- 06:58.860* :  recognition of the Palestinians. In a separate development, the Israeli war cabinet Minister Beni Gantz
*06:59.180- 07:05.200* :  said there were promising early signs of progress on a new deal to release hostages from Gaza.
*07:05.780- 07:10.260* :  On Sunday, he'd said that if the captives were not freed by Ramadan next month,
*07:11.220- 07:15.100* :  Israel would begin its threatened assault on the overcrowded border city of Rafa.
*07:15.860- 07:19.980* :  Israel did manage to rescue two hostages held there earlier this month,
*07:20.440- 07:25.740* :  but the raid reportedly left dozens of Palestinian civilians dead. Our special correspondent
*07:25.780- 07:33.640* :  Fergel Keen sent this report from Jerusalem. The hostage rescue was a rare success for the
*07:33.640- 07:39.780* :  special forces teams trying to save the 130 people, including two children, still believed
*07:39.780- 07:46.820* :  held by Hamas. Early this morning, Israeli commanders carried out a hostage rescue mission deep inside
*07:46.820- 07:57.600* :  Rafa in Gaza. The cost of that rescue in Palestinian lives was high. At least 72 people reported
*07:57.600- 08:04.000* :  killed. Researchers from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza say 27 children and
*08:04.000- 08:14.560* :  22 women were among the dead. This doctor with the aid group, Medesan San Frontier,
*08:14.980- 08:20.260* :  protected her children with her own body when the bombing began at around 145 am.
*08:20.620- 08:26.540* :  When the sun rose and illuminated the area around her home, she was horrified by what she
*08:26.540- 08:32.000* :  discovered outside. She's asked to remain anonymous. On our home, I found a hole
*08:32.000- 08:38.720* :  in her limb, long to a human that we don't know who he is. It is in the stories of individual families
*08:38.720- 08:45.140* :  that the human cost of this raid is most clearly understood. Navara Al-Najar is a mother of six children
*08:45.140- 08:52.200* :  and is six months pregnant. She was cut by flying shrapnel. Her 32-year-old husband, Abed Al-Rachman,
*08:52.200- 08:58.700* :  was mortally wounded. When I woke up after being wounded, I started screaming with pain.
*08:58.940- 09:05.080* :  I opened my eyes. I saw my husband in his last breath. When my children saw him,
*09:05.080- 09:11.940* :  they were screaming, don't leave us. The couple's 13-year-old daughter Malak lost her eye after
*09:11.940- 09:19.000* :  being hit by a splinter of shrapnel. I was not treated immediately. All my after three days
*09:19.000- 09:25.640* :  was my surgery performed. I was injured in the eye and I was shot in my waist. What is my fault
*09:25.640- 09:33.080* :  that this happened to me? I'm in pain, pain. I lost my dad. He never fell us.
*09:35.260- 09:40.840* :  He Israeli's accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields. A military spokesman said the
*09:40.840- 09:46.600* :  IDF works to mitigate harm to civilians. Military lawyers advise commanders on how to meet their
*09:46.600- 09:52.820* :  international legal obligations. And the IDF analyzes and takes into account the expected military
*09:52.820- 09:58.660* :  advantage and likely collateral harm to civilians, survivors like the MSF doctor
*09:59.120- 10:03.700* :  fear that the horror of February 12th will soon be forgotten amid new attacks.
*10:04.500- 10:10.400* :  I know that this message will change nothing. To be honest, the one who died is the one who's lucky.
*10:10.680- 10:14.980* :  The one who lived to suffer again and again and again, who's the one who had been cursed
*10:14.980- 10:21.980* :  and abandoned by all people all around the world. And that report from Jerusalem was by a
*10:21.980- 10:28.500* :  fertile keen. The main hospital in the U.S. state of Alabama has paused IVF procedures because
*10:28.500- 10:33.760* :  of fears of being prosecuted following a court ruling. Last week, the state's Supreme Court
*10:33.760- 10:39.980* :  ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. It's brought a rush of warnings
*10:39.980- 10:44.640* :  about the potential impact on fertility treatments and the freezing of embryos. Here's our North
*10:44.640- 10:50.100* :  America correspondent Nomiya Igbal. This ruling by Alabama's Supreme Court basically states that
*10:50.100- 10:55.280* :  an embryo or fertilized egg is now a person. The southern states, like many others,
*10:55.280- 11:00.740* :  outlaws all abortions, making no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. However,
*11:00.740- 11:06.440* :  Alabama is the only one that has defined life as beginning at conception. The case came after
*11:06.440- 11:11.740* :  three families sued a fertility clinic. Their frozen embryos were destroyed when a hospital patient
*11:11.740- 11:16.320* :  wandered into a storage room, removed them from a cryogenic freezer and dropped them.
*11:16.760- 11:20.700* :  A lower court ruled the embryos could not be defined as people or children
*11:20.700- 11:25.060* :  and dismissed the wrongful death claim, but the Supreme Court overruled it.
*11:25.560- 11:30.860* :  The university hospital said they are saddened for those who rely on IVF to help build a family,
*11:30.860- 11:37.080* :  but they have to put procedures indefinitely on hold as they assess the impact of the ruling.
*11:37.520- 11:42.360* :  Nomiya Igbal reporting. Breast cancer detection normally requires mammograms,
*11:42.360- 11:48.200* :  ultrasounds and biopsies, but scientists say that could become a thing of the past with a simple
*11:48.200- 11:54.120* :  saliva test. Initial results are highly promising, they say. Beverly Arching spoke to one of those
*11:54.120- 11:59.100* :  involved in the research, Professor Josephine Esquivel, up short at the University of Florida.
*11:59.700- 12:06.180* :  The gold standard for screening is typically imaging so that you can get a mammogram done,
*12:06.180- 12:10.760* :  and then they see something on the mammogram that doesn't look good, and then they do the
*12:10.760- 12:15.600* :  ultrasound, there's something there that doesn't look good, let's do an MRI. You end up getting
*12:15.600- 12:23.080* :  a biopsy, so not only is it expensive, in most of the cases, it's inconclusive, but we're not sure,
*12:23.080- 12:29.260* :  you need to come back in six months and we'll do this test again. So with our sensors,
*12:29.260- 12:37.160* :  we detect whether you have breast cancer by the proteins in your saliva. There are proteins
*12:37.160- 12:46.520* :  in saliva that go up if you have breast cancer. It has been done before, but it's not popular because
*12:46.600- 12:54.040* :  the method to detect it is very expensive, and the method to detect it is not that sensitive.
*12:54.460- 13:00.840* :  How does this method of testing the saliva work exactly? There is a sensor, it's called the
*13:00.840- 13:07.340* :  printed circuit board, and we use the repurposed glucose strip that we use currently to detect
*13:07.840- 13:13.460* :  diabetes, or to detect your blood sugar. You buy that at the store, and then you prick yourself,
*13:13.460- 13:21.280* :  you put it on the strip, that's how that works. So we repurpose that, and we put saliva on that
*13:21.280- 13:27.800* :  strip, and the sensor will pretty much tell us what the levels of the biomarkers are in this
*13:27.800- 13:35.540* :  saliva. We tested the invasive type, it's called the DCIS or the INSY2, the one that's localized
*13:35.540- 13:40.960* :  within the breast, so those are the two types that we've tested them on. And this research has
*13:40.960- 13:47.100* :  been quite small, how confident are you in its accuracy? We're actually pretty confident because
*13:47.100- 13:54.200* :  even with the small sample size that we have, we've already been able to tell differences,
*13:54.760- 14:00.840* :  very significantly between the levels of these biomarkers in healthy individuals,
*14:00.860- 14:07.080* :  and individuals with breast cancer. How soon will this be available for more people
*14:07.080- 14:13.880* :  but across the world? We applied for a grant with the National Cancer Institute. Our goal is to
*14:13.880- 14:21.620* :  cast a wider net, have a bigger sample size, and see if we can detect changes in these biomarkers
*14:21.980- 14:28.060* :  during treatment. So if a patient with breast cancer gets treated for breast cancer,
*14:28.060- 14:35.380* :  we want to see how do these levels change or if they do change. So there's still some work to be
*14:35.380- 14:42.100* :  done from bench top to actually taking it to market. Professor Josephine Esquivel
*14:42.100- 14:47.960* :  Upshore at the University of Florida talking to Beverly Otshing. Apple has announced a change
*14:47.960- 14:54.180* :  in the way it encrypts messages to protect them from being decoded in the future. It's also
*14:54.180- 14:59.000* :  been offering advice on what to do if your phone gets wet. I heard about that from our technology
*14:59.000- 15:05.000* :  reporter Chris Valance, but first he told me about the new upgrade to security. Apple's eye message
*15:05.000- 15:10.200* :  is already encrypted. In other words, no one can look at the contents of what you write and what
*15:10.200- 15:16.400* :  you send until it's received. What they're warning about now is that at some point in the future,
*15:16.400- 15:22.380* :  quantum computers may get powerful enough to crack encryption. So what they've announced is they're
*15:22.380- 15:26.960* :  going to change the way the encryption works. They're going to roll it out so that in the future,
*15:27.480- 15:33.200* :  no one will be able to use a quantum computer to read the contents of the message. Now why are they
*15:33.200- 15:38.860* :  doing this now? You might well ask, there is this idea that governments are basically gathering
*15:38.860- 15:46.060* :  vast amounts of data that is currently encrypted until the day comes when there is a powerful
*15:46.060- 15:51.360* :  enough quantum computer to actually decrypt it and I'll have this trove of secrets that they can
*15:51.360- 15:56.920* :  pick through. So Apple is effectively guarding against that eventuality and it's quite a big step
*15:56.920- 16:00.840* :  for them given that the threat doesn't really exist yet. Yeah, so when will this be rolled out?
*16:01.240- 16:04.640* :  Well, it's getting rolled out this year and it's getting rolled out worldwide as well. And actually
*16:04.640- 16:09.820* :  some other messaging apps have taken similar rather more limited steps to try and protect against
*16:09.820- 16:14.760* :  this. Quantum menace, you could almost say signal WhatsApp Google even. People are worried about
*16:14.760- 16:19.240* :  this. There was a report out of UK finance which represents Britain's financial and banking
*16:19.240- 16:23.440* :  services which said we've got to start thinking about this stuff now because otherwise people are
*16:23.440- 16:27.860* :  going to get into all the secret financial data and that could even be if you can read secrets
*16:27.860- 16:32.900* :  that were sent before the technology to decrypt them was invented. So there is a bit of a quantum
*16:32.900- 16:37.900* :  race to try and develop the technology that might be able to do this. Okay, so that's to protect us
*16:37.900- 16:43.480* :  in the future. What about this new way of protecting ourselves from a common menace now when we
*16:43.480- 16:49.380* :  drop our phone in some liquid a new way of drying it out? There is this, I suppose you could call
*16:49.380- 16:56.380* :  it a faux remedy that if your phone gets wet the very best thing you can do is to pop it in a bag
*16:56.380- 17:02.720* :  of dry rice. Apple have come out for the first time officially and said please don't do this,
*17:02.720- 17:07.280* :  it doesn't work because bits of it might get stuck in your phone. Really what you need to do is just
*17:07.280- 17:12.260* :  gently tap out the water holding it up, tapping it against the palm of your hand and leaving it
*17:12.260- 17:16.800* :  in a sort of an airy space to dry out gradually. Chris Valens are technology reporter.
*17:17.700- 17:23.540* :  The BT Tower once the tallest building in London is to become a hotel. The building has been a
*17:23.540- 17:29.120* :  distinctive part of the city's skyline since it was built in the 1960s. It's been bought by an
*17:29.120- 17:36.560* :  American hotel chain with the details here's Graham Satchel. By Minister Harold Wilson opening what
*17:36.560- 17:42.720* :  was then the post office tower in 1965 he used the building's new microwave radio links to talk
*17:42.720- 17:48.680* :  to the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. My Lord Mayor I hope you can hear me speaking from London we can
*17:48.680- 17:54.580* :  see you very clearly on the monitor can you see in here? Well I thank you for your greetings
*17:54.580- 18:02.200* :  to Prime Minister greetings from Birmingham to you sir and also to London. The tower's futuristic
*18:02.200- 18:08.040* :  design concrete clad in glass embodied Harold Wilson's vision of a new Britain forged in the
*18:08.040- 18:14.940* :  white heat of scientific revolution. At 190 meters it was for 16 years the tallest structure in the
*18:14.940- 18:20.540* :  capital. It's revolving restaurants and cluster of aerials stood out for miles dominating the London
*18:20.540- 18:27.100* :  skyline and it was hugely popular almost a million people took a tour in its first year but the
*18:27.100- 18:32.580* :  building closed to the public in 1971 after the restaurant was bombed by a group claiming to be
*18:32.580- 18:38.900* :  from a far left anarchist collective. Although it is still used as a relay point for TV signals
*18:39.480- 18:44.700* :  microwave links have been replaced by underground optical fiber technology has moved on.
*18:45.260- 18:50.340* :  The new owners have bought the building for $350 million it'll become an upmarket hotel
*18:50.340- 18:57.220* :  although there's no word yet if the revolving restaurant will once again turn. Graham Satchel
*18:59.880- 19:05.380* :  and still to come on the global news podcast because young women tend not to be socially or
*19:05.380- 19:10.800* :  financially or politically powerful it's easy to look down upon them and yet there they are
*19:10.800- 19:16.560* :  making language change again and again we find out where all the new words are coming from.
*19:26.020- 19:31.320* :  As it begins its presidency of the world's largest economies Brazil has said it once this year's
*19:31.320- 19:37.620* :  G20 meetings to focus on reforming global bodies like the UN as well as tackling climate change
*19:37.620- 19:43.420* :  and reducing poverty but inevitably much of the focus is likely to be on Israel's military action
*19:43.420- 19:48.860* :  in Gaza and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Indeed they have already been raised at a meeting of
*19:48.860- 19:54.780* :  G20 foreign ministers in Rio de Janeiro. The British foreign secretary David Cameron took the
*19:54.780- 20:00.180* :  opportunity to confront the Russians about their invasion of Ukraine. What I said at the foreign
*20:00.180- 20:06.140* :  ministers G20 meeting was just very clear and plain which is there is no more serious issue for
*20:06.140- 20:11.400* :  the world and it's the world that's gathered here the one country invading another in this completely
*20:11.400- 20:16.360* :  illegal and unacceptable way and the whole world should get behind Ukraine should support Ukraine
*20:16.760- 20:20.300* :  and should call out the illegality of what Putin and his cronies have done.
*20:20.780- 20:25.580* :  Mr Cameron also told the BBC that he and his counterparts from France, Canada and Germany
*20:25.580- 20:31.520* :  had used their speeches to name the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in front of the Russian foreign
*20:31.520- 20:38.420* :  minister Sergei Lavrov and hold Russia responsible for what he called his murder. Our correspondent
*20:38.420- 20:42.560* :  Ioni Wells is at the summit in Rio and told me more about the mood at the meeting.
*20:43.900- 20:48.200* :  Well certainly I think the tensions were high here at the summit earlier. In the room
*20:48.360- 20:55.160* :  Sergei Lavrov was at opposite both the UK's foreign secretary Lord Cameron but also the US's
*20:55.160- 21:00.320* :  Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well and this comes after the UK had just announced fresh
*21:00.320- 21:07.800* :  sanctions on six prison bosses at the penal centre in Russia where the opposition leader Alexei
*21:08.100- 21:13.920* :  Navalny died and it comes ahead of the US expected to announce further sanctions on Russia
*21:13.920- 21:18.720* :  later this week so certainly tensions in the room expected to be pretty high but speaking after
*21:18.720- 21:24.060* :  his intervention as we heard that Lord Cameron said that the UK along with other nations including
*21:24.060- 21:30.420* :  Germany, France, Australia, Canada used the opportunity with Sergei Lavrov in the room to strongly
*21:30.420- 21:36.860* :  call out Russia both for the war in Ukraine but also on the death of Alexei Navalny.
*21:36.900- 21:44.040* :  Now the UK has along with other nations and some of the UK's allies have strongly blamed Russia
*21:44.040- 21:51.340* :  for the death of Navalny and Lord Cameron told me afterwards that he had had a person he
*21:51.340- 21:56.060* :  asked all the other nations in the room to think if there was anything more important to them
*21:56.140- 22:02.000* :  than their own sovereignty and sovereignty to prevent countries from being invaded by another
*22:02.000- 22:06.300* :  nation. He said that that was particularly something that he felt it was important for those
*22:06.300- 22:12.280* :  in the room like the hosts Brazil who are allies of Russia to hear and we know how the Russian
*22:12.280- 22:19.560* :  delegation reacted. We as reporters are not actually allowed into these meetings they are all
*22:19.560- 22:25.100* :  taking place behind closed doors but when I was speaking to David Cameron after his intervention
*22:25.220- 22:32.800* :  he told me that Sergei Lavrov used his speech to essentially call claims of murder that Russia
*22:32.800- 22:38.000* :  has faced a fabrication and also repeatedly looked away looked in his phone while Russia was
*22:38.000- 22:41.940* :  receiving some of that criticism so it doesn't seem like he's reacted particularly well to the
*22:41.940- 22:48.420* :  reception in the room. I only wells in Rio. Prosecutors in New York have accused the former president
*22:48.420- 22:54.840* :  of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, of working with violent drug traffickers to send tons of cocaine
*22:54.840- 23:00.240* :  to the United States. In opening arguments assistant U.S. District Attorney David Robles
*23:00.500- 23:05.800* :  said he would be calling convicted drug smugglers as witnesses. Mr. Hernandez is facing charges
*23:05.800- 23:11.560* :  of conspiring to import cocaine to the U.S. and of carrying weapons. He denies any wrongdoing
*23:11.560- 23:17.300* :  and says the case against him is politically motivated. Our Central America Correspondent Will Grant
*23:17.300- 23:23.900* :  reports. For the U.S. government attorney David Robles said Mr. Hernandez had sent ton after ton of
*23:23.900- 23:29.900* :  cocaine to the United States and in return for bribes abuse the institutional powers of his nation.
*23:29.900- 23:35.560* :  From the military to the justice system to protect the smugglers. He acknowledged that among
*23:35.560- 23:40.100* :  the witnesses to be called were convicted drug traffickers some guilty of dozens of murders.
*23:40.940- 23:45.820* :  He urged the jury to listen to their testimony though which he called the truth. In response it's
*23:45.820- 23:49.920* :  clear that the essence of the defense's argument is that such criminal witnesses,
*23:50.380- 23:54.360* :  several of whom are seeking reductions in their sentences in exchange for testifying,
*23:54.360- 24:00.660* :  cannot be trusted. They are motivated, said defense lawyer Renato Stavile by vengeance
*24:00.660- 24:06.380* :  after President Hernandez cracked down on their operations while in office. He insisted there
*24:06.380- 24:11.560* :  would be no video, no email or any bank records to link Mr. Hernandez to drug trafficking.
*24:12.560- 24:17.580* :  Rather said Mr. Stavile, putting murderers and drug dealers on the stand was not proof beyond
*24:17.580- 24:23.160* :  reasonable doubt. After a short recess the trial resumed with the prosecution calling a bookkeeper
*24:23.160- 24:28.700* :  with an agricultural firm, Renato's nationalist who claims to have handled and lauded drug money
*24:28.700- 24:34.040* :  for Mr. Hernandez and seen him in the presence of a convicted cocaine smuggler. The trial is
*24:34.040- 24:40.420* :  expected to last two to three weeks. Will Grant. Pollution controls over the past 50 years have
*24:40.420- 24:45.640* :  resulted in a huge drop in emissions of mercury in the Earth's atmosphere, but new research reveals
*24:45.640- 24:52.220* :  that levels of the poisonous heavy metal found in tuna have stayed the same since 1971. So what's
*24:52.220- 24:57.800* :  going on? I asked our environment correspondent Matt McGraw. Tuna is a top predator so it eats
*24:57.880- 25:02.040* :  other fish in the sea and those other fish come in contact with mercury and that's how it builds
*25:02.040- 25:07.200* :  up in the tuna. The expectation from scientists had been as the world has gotten to grips with the
*25:07.200- 25:12.600* :  mercury issue in terms of the sources of mercury which come from the burning of coal and gold mining
*25:12.600- 25:18.140* :  and other activities that actually the levels in the sea would drop and this study shows essentially
*25:18.140- 25:23.980* :  that that hasn't happened because the authors believe that there's been lots of mercury deposited
*25:23.980- 25:29.960* :  in the sea for centuries and that keeps welling up to the top and the tuna fish keep eating it and
*25:29.960- 25:34.440* :  that's why it seems to still be showing such high rates in their bodies. So the emissions have
*25:34.440- 25:40.060* :  gone down but the levels in the sea stayed constant and that's what's showing in the tuna.
*25:40.360- 25:45.400* :  And how dangerous is it for humans to eat this tuna that still got high levels of mercury in it?
*25:45.560- 25:50.060* :  Well scientists have known for decades that tuna poses a particular problem for pregnant women
*25:50.060- 25:56.060* :  and for young children as it's a neurotoxin that essentially builds up in your body and can cause
*25:56.060- 26:00.660* :  damaged unborn children and to younger people as well but also to adults it poses problems with
*26:00.660- 26:05.320* :  hearts and other issues like that but there's a lot of scientific debate about how much exposure
*26:05.320- 26:10.580* :  and how much should people eat as well as that. So I think there's a lot of ongoing questions
*26:10.580- 26:15.340* :  about that particular aspect of the study but the study doesn't shed any new light on that it
*26:15.340- 26:19.800* :  just says that levels remain constant in tuna they're not saying whether they're going up or down
*26:19.800- 26:24.480* :  the expectation would be that over longer term as these restrictions become more effective
*26:24.540- 26:31.320* :  then we would see a decline in tuna but the scientists say that could take several decades yet.
*26:31.700- 26:37.840* :  Yeah given the fact that this is mercury that was emitted decades ago is there anything that
*26:37.840- 26:42.620* :  can be done to stop it dwelling up from the bottom of the sea? Very little I think the view from
*26:42.620- 26:48.120* :  the scientists is that this legacy mercury as they call it will last as long essentially as there
*26:48.120- 26:52.020* :  are emissions going up in the atmosphere and they've been going up for several hundred years so
*26:52.120- 26:56.940* :  their hope is that a more strict regime in terms of what people can burn in terms of coal,
*26:56.940- 27:02.080* :  gold mining, even the cremation of human bodies with amalgam fillings that strict restrictions
*27:02.080- 27:07.600* :  on issues that produce emissions will eventually bring down the levels of mercury in the sea
*27:07.600- 27:12.100* :  over a period of two or three decades we may see a drop in the oceans but at the moment that's
*27:12.100- 27:16.620* :  not happening. The scientists say it's very similar to the situation we find ourselves in
*27:16.620- 27:22.140* :  the carbon dioxide where it's likely to persist in the atmosphere far longer than when the levels
*27:22.140- 27:27.000* :  of emissions from human activities may start to go down so it's an interesting analogy for
*27:27.000- 27:33.420* :  that type of pollution. Matt McGraw our environment corresponded. Shack it bed-rotting
*27:33.420- 27:40.540* :  boobnie just some of the more than 300 official new words added to Dictionary.com for 2024.
*27:41.320- 27:46.460* :  The aim is to keep up to date with contemporary culture in America as Alfie Habishan has been
*27:46.460- 27:51.640* :  finding out. And you look so beautiful part of it, James Harvey, I feel so beautiful.
*27:52.060- 27:58.220* :  Barbie Core a new word to help us explain our playful and pink war droves. It's just one of
*27:58.220- 28:04.920* :  327 added to America's biggest online dictionary which it says spans the galaxy of modern life
*28:04.920- 28:11.240* :  but how do they choose? Grat Barrett is head of lexicology. We look at social media. We look at
*28:11.240- 28:17.680* :  print media, broadcast media and when we come across language that seems novel to us. We look and see
*28:17.680- 28:22.460* :  if it's got depth to it. There's a kind of catch 22 when it comes to these words. If you've heard
*28:22.460- 28:26.740* :  of the word as a regular user you're like oh I've heard of that. What are they adding now? That's
*28:26.740- 28:29.600* :  kind of late and if you haven't heard of it you're like oh that's a flash on the band. Why did
*28:29.600- 28:34.560* :  they add that? Dictionaries are thought to be more than 4,000 years old and are constantly tinkered
*28:34.560- 28:40.200* :  with to explain moments we couldn't quite put our finger on like getting the ikk. I personally
*28:40.200- 28:44.920* :  and I think all the boys agree with one another. Obviously when we were up there making the food
*28:45.040- 28:50.420* :  and she's said that she's got the ikk. That's a sudden feeling of disgust for someone you are
*28:50.940- 28:56.300* :  usually coming out of nowhere. There are serious additions to global boiling,
*28:56.300- 29:01.080* :  fire tornadoes and super fog can all help explain the effects of climate change
*29:01.700- 29:07.160* :  while landlord shooting up rent prices for excessive cash will now be known as greed flation.
*29:07.880- 29:13.620* :  Mr Barrett told me his favorite. Stuff like girl dinner where girl dinner represents the
*29:13.620- 29:19.880* :  tendency of younger women to cook for the easy to make comfort food. Kind of an odd mix of
*29:19.880- 29:25.620* :  items on a plate but every single one of them is something that satisfies and there are more
*29:25.620- 29:29.900* :  reasons than that to want to girl dinner. Young women are the number one source of new words
*29:30.340- 29:35.260* :  playing a much bigger role in language than originally thought. It spreads the same way that fashion
*29:35.260- 29:40.940* :  does that jokes do that good ideas do and so it's all about the strong relationships that people
*29:40.940- 29:46.720* :  have and young women tend to have strong in groups because young women tend not to be socially
*29:46.720- 29:52.860* :  or financially or politically powerful. It's easy to look down upon them and yet there they are
*29:52.860- 29:58.600* :  making language change again and again and again. And that report by Alfrey Habishan.
*29:59.440- 30:04.640* :  Finally, it took an international search in two years of waiting but a doctor here in Britain
*30:04.640- 30:09.100* :  has finally met the young man who saved his life through a stem cell donation.
*30:09.100- 30:16.260* :  Dr Nick Embleton, a consultant in an intensive care baby unit, was diagnosed with rare blood cancer
*30:16.260- 30:22.740* :  in 2021. He contacted the BBC to help track down the donor who saved his life a 24-year-old from
*30:22.740- 30:28.000* :  Germany. Our health correspondent Sharon Barber has the story. How long has he been in
*30:28.000- 30:34.160* :  instance? He was born now. For more than 20 years, Dr Nick Embleton, a consultant at Newcastle's
*30:34.160- 30:40.560* :  intensive care baby unit, has helped to save thousands and his patients are the smallest in the
*30:40.560- 30:48.840* :  world, some weighing less than 500 grams. But one day in 2021, he learned that the life that he had
*30:48.840- 30:56.720* :  to try and save was his own. He'd been diagnosed with a rare blood cancer. I was fully aware that I might
*30:56.720- 31:03.640* :  die so I made a will, never made a will before. I went home and I realised that I had to kind of
*31:03.660- 31:08.340* :  break this news to my wife and my kids and I think I really knew what I was going to say.
*31:08.960- 31:15.160* :  Nick's only chance of survival was a bone marrow or a stem cell transplant but there were no matches
*31:15.160- 31:23.120* :  in the UK. The Anthony Nolan Charity then began a worldwide search and a match was found in Germany.
*31:24.140- 31:29.500* :  The stem cells were flown to the UK but it would take two years before Nick would know if it
*31:29.500- 31:36.920* :  really worked and if he would survive. It did and he now wanted to know who had saved his life
*31:37.560- 31:44.240* :  and he called me and tween us the search began. Anthony Nolan tracked down the donor who agreed
*31:44.240- 31:57.120* :  to fly to the UK. And this was the moment that they met at Maggie's Cancer Support Centre in Newcastle.
*31:58.060- 32:05.460* :  Lovely to see you. Lovely to meet you. I'm very sorry. Hi, Nick. I'm very overwhelmed.
*32:06.140- 32:14.220* :  I know I'm shaking too. I'm shaking too. The cancer cells have all gone and so when they
*32:14.220- 32:20.460* :  check my blood now, I mean all of those blood cells belong to you. I would be dead if it wasn't for you.
*32:20.980- 32:27.540* :  I've got four children. Four. Yeah. Nice. They wouldn't have their dad if I just really want to thank you
*32:27.540- 32:29.520* :  for the hard work though.
*32:35.100- 32:41.320* :  Marius Furner from Germany had signed up to the register as a teenager. It was something many young
*32:41.320- 32:48.020* :  people did he said and there's no payment involved and he was only 21 when he heard he was a match
*32:48.020- 32:54.460* :  for someone and donated as stem cells to try and save a life. But he didn't know who. He recalled
*32:54.460- 33:01.480* :  the moment that he heard that it had worked. After that information only the tears comes out. I was on
*33:01.480- 33:09.560* :  the way to my work and I had parked my car and got out and did fresh air and tears blew out.
*33:10.780- 33:16.560* :  Watching these two men now full of life and laughing, making plans to meet each other's family
*33:16.560- 33:22.940* :  and to keep in touch, they describe themselves as blood brothers, as saviors and they're definitely
*33:22.940- 33:26.820* :  friends for life. Our health correspondent Sharon Barber.
*33:29.320- 33:33.280* :  And that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
