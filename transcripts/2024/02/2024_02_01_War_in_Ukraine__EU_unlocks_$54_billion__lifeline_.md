*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:18.360* :  by advertising. Hi, I'm Una Chaplin and I'm the host of a new podcast called Hollywood Exiles.
*00:19.040- 00:25.080* :  It tells the story of how my grandfather Charlie Chaplin and many others were caught up in a
*00:25.080- 00:32.000* :  campaign to root out communism in Hollywood. Hollywood Exiles from CBC podcasts and the BBC
*00:32.000- 00:38.820* :  World Service. Find it wherever you get your podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC
*00:38.820- 00:45.600* :  World Service. I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 1st of February these are our
*00:45.600- 00:53.260* :  main stories. The European Union agrees to free up $54 billion of aid for Kiev. This is good news.
*00:54.080- 01:00.420* :  This will give the credibility, the legitimacy and the predictability that is expected from us
*01:00.420- 01:06.500* :  because Ukraine's security is Europe's security. But what will it mean for the conflict?
*01:06.540- 01:14.180* :  People in Myanmar find a new way to protest the military coup there. How one DJ is changing the
*01:14.180- 01:20.260* :  face of ballet and we get rare access inside potentially deadly kilns in Cambodia.
*01:22.840- 01:29.640* :  Also in this podcast. I'm not afraid to say it. I'm really anti-feminist. I don't think that
*01:29.640- 01:37.240* :  the feminism of nowadays represents equality between men and women. A backlash against feminism in
*01:37.240- 01:46.660* :  Spain is it enough to stop the progress being made there? With no end in sight to the war in
*01:46.660- 01:52.400* :  Ukraine today, Kiev has been thrown a financial and military lifeline by the European Union.
*01:52.920- 01:58.760* :  For six weeks now a $54 billion package of financial and military aid has been held up because
*01:58.760- 02:04.880* :  of objections by Hungary. Now though the EU has unanimously passed the deal. President of the
*02:04.880- 02:08.700* :  European Parliament, Robert Metzola, said Ukraine was their priority.
*02:09.220- 02:15.000* :  This is good news. This will give the credibility, the legitimacy and the predictability that
*02:15.740- 02:20.900* :  is expected from us because Ukraine's security is Europe's security.
*02:22.100- 02:28.760* :  And for this we must deliver on the commitment we made two years ago that we will stand with Ukraine
*02:28.760- 02:35.800* :  for as long as it takes because in doing so we knew that at a time would come where our world
*02:36.760- 02:42.000* :  would be put to the test and that moment is now and for the European Parliament we're very clear
*02:42.000- 02:46.100* :  from the very beginning that there was no other option but to do precisely this.
*02:46.800- 02:50.400* :  Our Europe regional editor Alice Adley has been monitoring the deal.
*02:50.840- 02:56.740* :  It seems the deal for $54 billion of funding over four years was reached at surprising speed
*02:56.740- 03:02.140* :  as European leaders had been bracing themselves for hours of discussion after Viktor Orban
*03:02.220- 03:07.400* :  had vetoed the deal in December. It's reported that Viktor Orban, the Hungarian leader,
*03:07.400- 03:12.860* :  had met the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the EU institutions before the full summit.
*03:13.540- 03:18.940* :  The Hungarian Prime Minister, who's an ally of Vladimir Putin, had wanted an annual review
*03:18.940- 03:23.740* :  of the aid package for Ukraine. But he was faced with opposition from the other EU leaders,
*03:24.240- 03:29.980* :  notably Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister of his neighbour Poland. Mr Tusk had said there was no
*03:29.980- 03:36.040* :  problem with Ukraine fatigue but they were getting Orban fatigue. He added before the meeting that
*03:36.040- 03:41.680* :  Mr Orban needed to decide whether he was part of our community as he put it. On the deal itself
*03:41.680- 03:46.900* :  the details are still sketchy but diplomatic sources have told Rotter's news agency
*03:46.900- 03:51.760* :  it includes a yearly discussion of the package and the option to renew it in two years
*03:52.300- 03:57.660* :  if needed in quotes. So, how has this deal been received? I asked our correspondent in
*03:57.660- 04:03.320* :  Kiev Sarah Reinsford. I think a lot of relief here in Kiev and a lot of gratitude as well.
*04:03.320- 04:08.400* :  That was the word that Vladimir Zelensky used when he reacted to the news that this deal had been
*04:08.400- 04:12.360* :  done. I think people were quite nervous although they were trying not to show it. They had been
*04:12.360- 04:18.280* :  stressing all along that this, as Ukraine sees it, wasn't about an aid package from the EU but it
*04:18.280- 04:23.620* :  was about an investment by the EU in its own security and stability but it is absolutely vital
*04:23.620- 04:28.720* :  money for Ukraine itself because wars are extremely expensive and it's not just about the bullets
*04:28.720- 04:34.340* :  and the bombs. It is about keeping life behind the front lines ticking over. It's about paying
*04:34.340- 04:38.420* :  pensions. It's about paying salaries. People like teachers who are still trying to keep going
*04:38.420- 04:44.680* :  in the middle of a war zone. It's about keeping the economy afloat and Ukraine was stressing all
*04:44.680- 04:49.420* :  along that it needed that money and particularly, of course, needing it at a time when the money
*04:49.420- 04:55.720* :  that the US has been promising Ukraine for a long time is still blocked in the US Congress. So,
*04:55.900- 05:00.600* :  the European funding is not just vital money. It's also, I think, people here see it as an
*05:00.600- 05:07.500* :  expression of solidarity and support going forward. Sarah Reinsford. Now a quick request from my
*05:07.500- 05:12.960* :  fellow presenter, Oliver Conway. Hi there. Do you have any questions about the war in Ukraine?
*05:12.960- 05:18.300* :  What has happened to the children abducted by Russian forces? Why is Ukraine now hitting targets
*05:18.300- 05:24.180* :  inside Russia much more? Or anything else? With the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion,
*05:24.180- 05:28.800* :  we are asking the team from Ukraine cast for their views on the state of the conflict.
*05:28.800- 05:36.120* :  So if there's anything you want to know, please email us at globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk or tweet
*05:36.120- 05:41.260* :  at globalnewspod. And if possible, record your question as a voice note. Thanks.
*05:42.440- 05:49.580* :  Oliver Conway there. Now, in a world where let's face it, it is getting hot every year. There's
*05:49.580- 05:56.420* :  been ongoing research into how much heat the human body can withstand. Now, a new study in Southeast
*05:56.420- 06:01.580* :  Asia says that thousands of workers are being forced to labour in conditions that are too hot
*06:02.000- 06:07.000* :  and risking their lives in the process. The study of working conditions in Cambodia's garment and
*06:07.000- 06:13.020* :  brick industries highlights the risks climate change will pose to those already struggling in hot
*06:13.020- 06:18.140* :  countries. Our correspondent Laura Bicca gained rare access to the brick kilns for this report
*06:18.520- 06:22.260* :  and found that excess heat was just one of the safety risks there.
*06:24.300- 06:29.520* :  How hot is too hot? And what effect is our warming climate?
*06:29.520- 06:35.620* :  Having on some of the world's most vulnerable workers. That was what we hoped to examine in
*06:35.620- 06:43.680* :  Cambodia's brick kilns. But the conditions we found were so much worse. 47-year-old Chandria
*06:43.680- 06:51.420* :  stacks bricks while surrounded by a wall of heat. She's inside an airless kill, often heated to
*06:51.420- 07:01.520* :  1,503 to set the plane. Her colleagues drag a huge fan to the small entrance, but instead of
*07:01.520- 07:12.760* :  keeping her cool, it kicks up dust. It is like working inside a burning prison and it is so hot.
*07:12.760- 07:18.420* :  It impacts our internal organs. I have asked the owner to provide us with more funds,
*07:19.080- 07:22.820* :  but they don't do it because they are afraid of spending on electricity.
*07:26.800- 07:30.160* :  But in Cambodia, he does not the only problem.
*07:31.960- 07:36.640* :  We've just arrived at one brick kiln and there are piles and piles and piles of offcuts,
*07:36.740- 07:42.660* :  of garments, all wrapped in bags. Now they use these offcuts to fuel the kilns because it's
*07:42.660- 07:47.080* :  cheaper than putting in wood. Is this your family?
*07:50.640- 07:56.800* :  Fasitive two cocells scoops up a mix of fabric, plastic and rubber to keep the kiln fires burning.
*07:58.260- 08:05.840* :  Black toxic smokes, spews out the chimney. His barefoot 3-year-old girl runs past a pile of waste
*08:06.320- 08:11.280* :  from what would have been flannel pajamas made for children in colder climates.
*08:12.180- 08:15.140* :  They have the faces of Anna and Elsa from frozen on them.
*08:18.180- 08:21.660* :  I'm going through the label. We'll solve the children play around me. I've seen Disney.
*08:22.400- 08:30.020* :  We've seen some Puma labels. All the offcuts ending up here to be burnt in the kiln.
*08:31.880- 08:38.320* :  We also found labels from Clark's shoes and H&M among others. All manufacture their goods in
*08:38.320- 08:44.500* :  Cambodia and getting rid of the offcuts from their factories in this way is against protocol for
*08:44.500- 08:54.280* :  major Western brands. All promise the BBC that they would investigate. No matter how toxic or hot
*08:54.280- 09:00.280* :  the kilns become, these workers can never leave. The owners have paid off debts from their farms
*09:00.280- 09:08.980* :  now they and their children are trapped. We have a debt with them. If we leave, we are afraid of being
*09:08.980- 09:15.960* :  arrested and imprisoned. So we must struggle here. If they ask us to enter the fire, we will do it.
*09:18.080- 09:22.860* :  The majority of brick workers wear farmers. As Cambodia's climate changes and droughts
*09:22.860- 09:28.800* :  become more common, they took on debt to try to keep their farms going. When that failed, they migrated
*09:28.800- 09:35.640* :  to the city. But the air in so little that the debt will never be paid. The kilns of Cambodia
*09:35.640- 09:42.740* :  have fed the capital's construction boom. But as the buildings of Pnom Penh reach towards the sky,
*09:43.260- 09:49.860* :  the city has left behind those who've helped build it. I was Laura Bicker and the names of those
*09:49.860- 09:56.740* :  workers in the report were changed for their protection. Now to a somewhat unlikely battle we've
*09:56.740- 10:02.360* :  been following. Elon Musk versus the US state of Delaware. The Tesla Boss is now eyeing up a
*10:02.360- 10:08.720* :  dramatic move of the Carmakers' legal headquarters after a judge in Delaware annulled his near 56
*10:08.720- 10:15.060* :  billion dollar Tesla pay package. After the ruling, he posted on social media, never incorporate
*10:15.060- 10:19.700* :  your company in the state of Delaware. Many big firms, including Amazon, are registered there
*10:19.700- 10:26.180* :  because of its low taxes. We asked Chris Robacher, business leadership expert at UCL School of
*10:26.180- 10:30.320* :  Management Advisory Board here in London, what he thought would happen next.
*10:31.080- 10:37.380* :  We are now in the wonderful work of Elon Musk, not your standard CEO. Tesla would not be where
*10:37.380- 10:45.680* :  Tesla is now without Elon Musk. He's met the objectives that he was set. The organization is
*10:45.680- 10:53.060* :  moving forwards. But then again, the question is, is he still the best person for the job? Because
*10:53.500- 10:59.180* :  one of the classic things we repeatedly see is that slightly eccentric entrepreneurs who set up
*10:59.180- 11:04.540* :  organizations aren't necessarily always the person to continue to be the CEO once they've reached
*11:04.540- 11:13.060* :  a certain point. Delaware attracts because they have low income taxes, but Texas is fighting with
*11:13.060- 11:18.900* :  Delaware to get corporates in because again, they have low taxes, but in a slightly different way.
*11:19.340- 11:25.480* :  Now, exactly how that would work out, we're not sure as yet. But shall we say, if you have to go
*11:25.480- 11:32.360* :  from Delaware to anywhere, Texas is the logical place to go. And I think he's working also on the
*11:32.360- 11:39.780* :  basis that he's got his other plan there. So it makes some form of logical sense. But again, will
*11:39.780- 11:44.380* :  the shareholders agree? I mean, what happened with the judge suggests that the board weren't being
*11:44.380- 11:49.640* :  honest with the shareholders. So we will see. Well, indeed, that was Chris Robuck.
*11:51.160- 11:56.280* :  The British DJ and musician Sam Shepard has been releasing electronic music under the
*11:56.280- 12:01.460* :  alias floating points for more than a decade now, working his way out through London's club scene.
*12:01.820- 12:06.680* :  But now he's using his music to shake up a totally different scene, working with San Francisco
*12:06.680- 12:13.480* :  Ballet on a retelling of the Pandora myth by the classicist Natalie Haynes and AI.
*12:14.400- 12:18.760* :  He's been talking to Nicholas Stambridge about bringing electronic music into America's
*12:18.760- 12:27.000* :  oldest ballet company. San Francisco Ballet's mere mortals started with a conversation between
*12:27.000- 12:32.360* :  the composer Sam Shepard, aka floating points, and the ballet company's artistic director,
*12:32.360- 12:37.700* :  formerly of the English National Ballet, tomorrow, Rojo, about the philosophical questions
*12:37.820- 12:47.240* :  humanities asking about artificial intelligence. The core story is the Pandora myth, the unintended
*12:47.240- 12:53.600* :  consequences of unleashing power. One of the current iterations that is artificial intelligence
*12:53.600- 13:01.940* :  that the lid has been lifted. My mind was so buzzing with ideas for how musically I could depict
*13:02.700- 13:08.180* :  that story and the plurality in her character. This is your first ballet. What are the challenges
*13:08.180- 13:15.340* :  composing for dancers and the San Francisco ballet orchestra? I've not had any experience
*13:15.340- 13:20.920* :  fighting for such a large ensemble. I think there's 17 musicians. I really wanted to make the
*13:20.920- 13:26.520* :  electronics a part of the orchestration. The choreographer was keen for that electronic element to
*13:26.520- 13:32.700* :  drive a lot of the rhythmic elements of the piece, so there's sections where there's a big percussion
*13:37.700- 13:44.220* :  workout. The render that you can hear is a computer rendition of the score I'd written. That was
*13:44.220- 13:51.000* :  an important tool for the choreographer to be able to create the work too. There's also lots of
*13:51.000- 14:01.020* :  interesting sounds. This is a duet section between Pandora meeting epimetheus, a harb and
*14:01.020- 14:08.540* :  phervox. I send the woodwind off stage at moments where they're playing in a sealed room. You can't
*14:08.540- 14:13.000* :  acoustically hear them and then those signals are getting processed through the electronic instruments
*14:13.000- 14:19.060* :  on stage and triggered by percussionist can novel sonic environment from the pit orchestra.
*14:24.120- 14:28.980* :  The San Francisco ballet is just doors away from Hayes Valley. The center where artificial
*14:28.980- 14:35.200* :  intelligence is all happening at the moment. This mix of ballet electronic music visuals generated
*14:35.500- 14:41.020* :  with help from AI. What are your thoughts about where our cultural experience is headed?
*14:41.620- 14:48.780* :  I'm kind of scared of how brilliant it could be. Maybe it will push artists into relevance. I
*14:48.780- 14:54.460* :  don't know. For now, luckily some of the AI music I've heard is I don't enjoy it and that's
*14:55.200- 15:01.940* :  great for me as an artist, but then a week later it's getting better and a week later it's even
*15:01.940- 15:07.720* :  better and at some point it's going to start creating some really interesting music that's
*15:07.720- 15:13.320* :  truly original. It's interesting and confusing in Pandora's Boxes indeed being open.
*15:17.540- 15:21.360* :  That was the musician Sam Sheppard. It's still to come in this podcast.
*15:23.760- 15:29.940* :  We encounter the doors please flagrantly asking for money for us and they even search for money
*15:29.940- 15:36.300* :  under your underwear. The people taking a dangerous route through South America to escape what they

*16:51.820- 16:57.760* :  Cities and towns across Myanmar are quieter than usual today. Streets in Yangon, the former
*16:57.760- 17:03.300* :  capital are deserted. There's pro-democracy campaigners urge people to stare at home in silent
*17:03.300- 17:08.760* :  protest on the third anniversary of the military coup. Elsewhere though demonstrations have been
*17:08.760- 17:12.700* :  noisier. These were the scenes outside the United Nations building in Bangkok.
*17:18.300- 17:22.460* :  For the protest leader Suraj Geeri explained why they were there.
*17:23.220- 17:28.800* :  We want the world to know our demands and the extent of our dissatisfaction with the
*17:28.800- 17:35.000* :  dictator, the leader of the Myanmar junta. Today is the third anniversary of the coup and we believe
*17:35.000- 17:41.200* :  it will be the last year for the military regime. This year will symbolise the victory of the people
*17:41.200- 17:47.720* :  of Myanmar. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says he's gravely concerned over the deteriorating
*17:47.720- 17:54.360* :  security and humanitarian situation. The 2021 military takeover triggered an intensification of
*17:54.360- 17:59.700* :  armed conflicts across the country, with clashes between the army and rebel groups leaving thousands
*17:59.700- 18:05.860* :  of people dead and over 2 million displaced. So, Wintan, the editor of the BBC's Burmese
*18:05.860- 18:10.320* :  Service, is following developments and gave us this update on the situation in Myanmar.
*18:10.980- 18:14.700* :  The regime has extended the United States to another six months yesterday that
*18:14.700- 18:21.160* :  announcements was made. Do counter that claim then there has been call for a silent protest.
*18:21.160- 18:25.920* :  So, asking people to stay indoors. So, you would see that in younger and former capital,
*18:25.920- 18:32.540* :  very kind of bustling cities that streets are empty. People stay indoors and then shops closed.
*18:33.000- 18:39.440* :  Although they are pressure for the shops to open at any cost, the protests that we used to see
*18:39.440- 18:44.620* :  previously did not happen, because people who are also quite concerned, security troops are
*18:44.620- 18:49.920* :  patrolling their towns. So, that's why the way that they can demonstrate their displeasure against
*18:49.920- 18:55.000* :  this coup is to stay indoors. And life is getting increasingly difficult and the economy is suffering.
*18:55.540- 19:02.100* :  The generals are still in power, that they've been able to find ways of keeping the country afloat,
*19:02.100- 19:05.880* :  but on a day-to-day basis, it's very difficult for most people, isn't it? Very difficult. We
*19:05.880- 19:11.540* :  talked about two million people displaced. So, it's really bad for those people kind of in caught
*19:11.540- 19:18.480* :  up in the fighting. Because the civil war has been raging in Myanmar for months now, and the
*19:18.480- 19:24.060* :  fighting has happened. It's happening across the country. So, people caught up in those places
*19:24.060- 19:29.460* :  are very, very difficult. It's not better off for the people in the cities also. The economy is
*19:29.460- 19:35.280* :  enrooing. They are long-cused of people at the bumps to get their petrol. They are cars filled,
*19:35.280- 19:42.400* :  and long hours of power outages do. I mean, there are UN sanctions and US sanctions against
*19:42.400- 19:47.160* :  the country. The fresh ones put in place a couple of days ago by the United States. And yet,
*19:47.160- 19:54.080* :  the generals are still able to hold on to power. Is that partly or primarily because of China's
*19:55.000- 20:00.580* :  support? China's support primarily, economically, yes. Also, the important thing is for the regime
*20:00.580- 20:06.600* :  to have this diplomatic support in the international, because when the United Security Council wants
*20:06.600- 20:12.900* :  to go full-on with this economy sanctions, China is there to veto and block it. And China also
*20:12.900- 20:17.720* :  plays very important a role economically, because China has major businesses in the country.
*20:18.060- 20:22.620* :  People in Burma and Myanmar, we play the long game. They've been used to this kind of
*20:22.620- 20:29.020* :  problems for decades now. Are people losing hope? No, because recently, they have regained their
*20:29.020- 20:34.680* :  hope, because in better fees and better grounds, that military has been losing significantly.
*20:35.380- 20:39.580* :  So, previously, we thought that it's indomitable kind of military, where this powerful
*20:39.580- 20:45.080* :  they are might. They are losing in their better grounds to demoralize the troops within
*20:45.080- 20:49.720* :  among the troops. Also, people saw that as a hope. That was my colleague, Soin Tan.
*20:51.220- 20:55.620* :  Kenya is considering whether religious groups should be subject to more regulation.
*20:56.340- 21:00.340* :  That's after the bodies of hundreds of followers of a cult, including children, were found
*21:00.340- 21:06.860* :  staffed to death in March in Shakaholo Forest in the south of the country. All over the continent,
*21:06.860- 21:13.060* :  there are other religious leaders who wield extreme power over their followers, but how can
*21:13.060- 21:18.680* :  harm to followers be prevented? Alan Kasujik spoke to two Christian
*21:18.680- 21:25.120* :  Theologians to discuss the issue. Reverend Dr Kenneth Ophula, a priest in the Church of Kenya,
*21:25.120- 21:30.440* :  who's currently teaching at the University of Oxford, and the right Reverend Dr Zach Nurengi,
*21:30.440- 21:36.720* :  who was assistant bishop of Campala with the Church of Uganda. He started by explaining the
*21:36.720- 21:39.700* :  attraction of the prophet-led miracle-based churches.
*21:44.720- 21:50.140* :  So one of the things you've got to face up to right now on the continent is the
*21:50.140- 21:58.140* :  impoverishment of Africans. People in order to get a job, they go to a church to pray for a miracle,
*21:58.920- 22:04.940* :  to have food on the table, miracles, miracles, and the reason really is impoverishment.
*22:04.940- 22:09.580* :  And I use the word impoverishment. I'm not talking about poverty. Africa is a very rich continent,
*22:09.580- 22:15.540* :  but you have political leaders that literally are predators. They steal from the people,
*22:15.840- 22:22.840* :  and so the people are poor. And so you have these rising prophets, teachers, who pretend to provide
*22:22.840- 22:29.100* :  a solution. The last time I checked Europeans and some Americans and Asians, they don't
*22:29.100- 22:35.080* :  pray as hard, but they have jobs. God's order is work. It's God who gives us all these energies
*22:35.080- 22:41.000* :  to work, to tilt the land, and the land feeds us. That's God's order. It's not by form of some
*22:41.420- 22:42.440* :  amazing miracle. No.
*22:50.680- 22:56.580* :  The question then becomes, how do you protect people from criminality that is blatantly playing
*22:56.580- 23:01.160* :  out in this so-called religious market? There's been money, and there's been politics, and hence
*23:01.160- 23:07.180* :  the evolution of this whole faith thing, leading up to people starving themselves in Kenya, Dr. Foula.
*23:07.180- 23:13.600* :  Very true, with a prolific issue. Yeah, very true. I think we've got to really grapple with the
*23:13.600- 23:19.240* :  question of the management of the state. I would argue personally that that is a root cause.
*23:20.180- 23:25.280* :  And what else you are seeing are simply consequences. I mean, if you think about
*23:25.280- 23:31.140* :  peoples and countries that have lived their entire lives through war, I can speak about Sudan,
*23:31.760- 23:40.200* :  Uganda, several African countries, that kind of a context is breeding ground for all manner
*23:40.200- 23:45.900* :  of criminals. Whether those criminals are in charge of the state, whether those criminals are
*23:45.900- 23:51.940* :  in charge of the religious fraternities, I think we assume bishops apostles, those who
*23:51.940- 23:58.860* :  certify, identify in this way, will be good people. No, there are very many criminals. If a
*23:58.860- 24:08.660* :  bishop wants access to some good, and the provider of those good is some president, and the president
*24:08.660- 24:13.500* :  wants to make sure that the next election, this bishop is going to sing his praise. What happens?
*24:13.500- 24:18.240* :  It's a symbiotic relationship. And to hear a longer version of that podcast,
*24:18.240- 24:22.420* :  just go to wherever you get your podcasts and search for BBC Africa Daily.
*24:24.360- 24:29.660* :  Most people will remember when Spain won the Women's Football World Cup, and the football chief
*24:29.660- 24:35.980* :  Luis Uruguayale's grabbed teammate, Jenny Eremoso, and Kister on the lips. It led to his
*24:35.980- 24:41.720* :  professional downfall, but it also tapped into a rift in Spanish society. Spain has one of those
*24:41.720- 24:46.580* :  powerful feminist movements in Europe, but the country recently passed a groundbreaking law on
*24:46.580- 24:53.060* :  sexual violence. It's one of very few countries where such legislation exists. But now the feminist
*24:53.060- 24:58.040* :  movement is facing a backlash, and more than half of the population feels that men are being
*24:58.040- 25:03.420* :  discriminated against. The BBC's Sofia Betiza traveled to Madrid to find out more.
*25:03.900- 25:12.880* :  It was the most infamous kiss of 2023, and now a judge is about to decide whether to bring
*25:12.880- 25:19.460* :  criminal charges against Luis Uruguayale's. For feminists, this is a huge victory,
*25:20.260- 25:27.520* :  but for many people in Spain, this is a symptom of an overpowerful, overreaching feminist lobby.
*25:28.520- 25:34.640* :  At an anti-government protest in Madrid, feminism was at the forefront of a lot of people's minds.
*25:46.640- 25:50.540* :  Spain has one of the most powerful feminist movements in Europe,
*25:51.240- 25:58.460* :  but to many, what started as a campaign-free quality is now actively discriminating against men.
*25:59.780- 26:03.880* :  That's how Pablo feels. He calls himself an anti-feminist.
*26:04.120- 26:11.800* :  A man approached me and started touching me, growing my hand to put it in his private words,
*26:12.660- 26:19.540* :  and he started pushing me to have sex with him and followed me home.
*26:20.280- 26:26.640* :  And when you reported this to the police, what kind of help did you get?
*26:26.640- 26:34.180* :  Zero. I found my local government, and they told me no, there are no public resources for men,
*26:34.180- 26:40.300* :  sorry. He was eventually sent to a women's organization and was given a lawyer,
*26:40.900- 26:46.780* :  but he doesn't feel like the court gave him the same protections that female victims are
*26:46.780- 26:52.880* :  entitled to. Barbara Tardón. Barbara was an advisor in the previous socialist government's
*26:52.880- 26:59.960* :  ministry of equality, and she was pivotal in drafting recent legislation, which radically shook up
*27:00.260- 27:07.280* :  the approach to sexual violence. The law is known as only yes means yes. It's all about consent,
*27:08.040- 27:13.940* :  so now rape victims in Spain don't have to prove they're subjected to physical violence.
*27:14.740- 27:19.680* :  It's the accused rapist who would have to prove that sex was consented to.
*27:20.440- 27:24.680* :  The law is controversial because it only focuses on women.
*27:25.360- 27:31.600* :  But if a man suffers sexual violence, we have also a system that protects them.
*27:32.080- 27:35.720* :  But they wouldn't get like reparation money, psychological support.
*27:35.720- 27:42.740* :  It's different. Of course, it's not the same, because we're talking about endemic violence.
*27:43.720- 27:48.980* :  At Madrid's main university campus, we meet students Diego Embednardo.
*27:49.340- 27:55.280* :  Being a boy nowadays in Spain is definitely a situation of constant concern about the way
*27:55.280- 28:02.320* :  you behave with women. They say that a lot of men their age are faithful of being falsely accused
*28:02.320- 28:07.940* :  of sexual violence. It's a day to day topic. I think we're actually really scared to be falsely
*28:07.940- 28:13.780* :  accused because I actually win your life. Only a tiny percentage of sexual violence allegations
*28:13.780- 28:20.900* :  turn out to be false. But people like Diego Embednardo see this as symptomatic of everything
*28:20.900- 28:27.960* :  that's wrong with feminism today, that it vilifies men. Feminists say that men like these
*28:27.960- 28:33.340* :  are just frustrated because they are finally losing privileges they've had for decades.
*28:34.240- 28:39.640* :  They call it a backlash, but with more than half of the population feeling that the
*28:39.640- 28:46.760* :  push for women's equality is going too far, anti-feminism in Spain is clearly more than a
*28:46.760- 28:52.960* :  fringe movement. Sophia Bittica reporting. Now, if you want to hear more on this story,
*28:52.960- 28:57.280* :  you can listen to the full documentary by searching Assignment on BBC Sounds.
*28:59.020- 29:04.700* :  A record number of Chinese people are using the South American migrant trail to reach the United
*29:04.700- 29:10.500* :  States. The migrants overland journeys start in Ecuador. That's the closest visa-free country
*29:10.500- 29:16.340* :  for Chinese nationals to the US. The BBC's Sean Yuan picked up the trail.
*29:16.340- 29:23.020* :  A slower economy and high youth unemployment rate of around 20% is driving a growing number of
*29:23.020- 29:28.120* :  people to leave China for the US. Around 30,000 met a journey through South America in the 11
*29:28.120- 29:33.000* :  months to the end of November, according to the US customs and border protection. Many of them are
*29:33.000- 29:39.340* :  young, like Lu, who met Medinguito, the capital of Ecuador. I'm very disappointed in the
*29:39.340- 29:45.580* :  general environment in China. The society in China is built on entering through the back door.
*29:46.180- 29:49.700* :  It's difficult to do anything without some sort of connections.
*29:52.900- 29:56.020* :  Like many, he first heard about the South American migrant trail from Douyin,
*29:56.020- 30:01.380* :  the Chinese version of TikTok. In terms of costs, I spoke to one of them who said he spent about
*30:01.380- 30:07.260* :  $3,000 to reach Kito, about three times the average monthly salary in China. James was
*30:07.260- 30:11.260* :  traveling with two others. He told me he was prepared to risk everything to get there.
*30:13.560- 30:18.360* :  Sometimes, you have to make decisions in your life. Going back to that place is an
*30:18.360- 30:25.360* :  nightmare, and rather die instead of going back. We are now at the bus terminal in Medigin,
*30:25.700- 30:31.100* :  the second biggest city in Colombia, and the migrants just finished a 26-hour journey from
*30:31.100- 30:38.420* :  to the border town between Ecuador and Colombia. I just want to cry now. He finds his
*30:38.420- 30:45.480* :  he and his traveling companions have been constantly threatened. It was already difficult enough,
*30:46.100- 30:52.180* :  but we encountered those pleas frequently asking for money from us, not just asking for money,
*30:52.840- 30:57.580* :  but also searching for the cash that we had hidden. They searched inside women's
*30:57.620- 31:01.840* :  sanitary packs, and they even searched for money under your underwear.
*31:02.660- 31:06.440* :  Once the migrants leave Colombia, they come from arguably the most treacherous part of the
*31:06.440- 31:11.400* :  journey. It's known as a daring gap. A rainforest that connects South and Central America
*31:11.400- 31:16.120* :  at the border with Panama. It takes days to hike through. I met some Chinese migrants with
*31:16.120- 31:21.720* :  an emerge from the jungle on the Panama side. The rainforest was so difficult to pass.
*31:22.360- 31:26.940* :  After this time, I would never ever want to walk in the rainforest again.
*31:27.860- 31:31.780* :  Crossing one border almost every other day, this migrants would soon reach the Mexican border,
*31:32.100- 31:35.960* :  where they would make the final push towards the U.S. and the hope of a better life.
*31:37.080- 31:38.020* :  Sean Yuan reporting.
*31:39.620- 31:43.120* :  Now, before we end this pod, a quick question. Would you pay for this?
*31:48.900- 31:53.920* :  I don't mean the song. I mean, the instrument, the guitar, the actual guitar that played those notes.
*31:54.700- 32:00.900* :  Well, Mark Noffler has sold more than 120 of his guitars, including the 1983 Les Paul
*32:00.900- 32:07.580* :  used on that song, Money for Nothing from Dar Strait's multi-million-selling album Brothers in Arms.
*32:08.360- 32:12.780* :  Some of the ten million dollars raised will go to charity, including a slice of the staggering
*32:12.780- 32:18.180* :  sum one bid are paid for the Les Paul. Our cultural correspondent, Noon Angie, was there.
*32:19.700- 32:24.400* :  Diostrates became superstars in the mid-80s with their hit single Money for Nothing,
*32:24.400- 32:30.800* :  a satire on rock access in the MTV era. Now, the guitar that its frontman used to
*32:30.800- 32:36.500* :  record the song, as well as Brothers in Arms, has been sold at auction for almost 600,000 pounds.
*32:37.600- 32:42.120* :  Most of his collection went on sale, spanning the entirety of his 50-year career.
*32:43.880- 32:48.640* :  Among the lots was the Pensasura that Noffler used at the Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday
*32:48.640- 32:55.220* :  tribute concert in June 1988, to play hits including Sultan's of Swing, which also sold for more
*32:55.220- 33:05.580* :  than 500,000 pounds. This is lot number 42, the extremely rare. And this is a 1959 Gibson Les Paul
*33:05.580- 33:14.360* :  with a sunburst finish, which Noffler described as killer, for £550,000. That price doesn't include
*33:14.360- 33:21.000* :  the buyer's premium, which will take the final cost closer to £700,000. Also on sale was the Gibson
*33:21.000- 33:27.000* :  Les Paul Gold Top Guitar, which is signed by Noffler, as well as Eric Clapton, Brian May, Bruce
*33:27.000- 33:32.900* :  Springsteen and other famous musicians. A quarter of the proceeds from the auction will be divided
*33:32.900- 33:38.980* :  equally and donated to the British Red Cross, Tusk and Brave Hearts of the Northeast. Before the
*33:38.980- 33:44.280* :  auction, Noffler said he hoped the instruments would find loving homes and would continue to be played.
*33:47.060- 33:48.300* :  No Nanji without report.
*33:51.100- 33:55.000* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
