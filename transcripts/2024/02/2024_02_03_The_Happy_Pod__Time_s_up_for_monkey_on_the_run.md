*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:18.360* :  by advertising. Hi, I'm Una Chaplin and I'm the host of a new podcast called Hollywood Exiles.
*00:19.040- 00:25.080* :  It tells the story of how my grandfather Charlie Chaplin and many others were caught up in a
*00:25.080- 00:32.000* :  campaign to root out communism in Hollywood. Hollywood Exiles from CBC podcasts and the BBC
*00:32.000- 00:39.160* :  World Service. Find it wherever you get your podcasts. This is the Happy Pold from the BBC World Service.
*00:44.060- 00:48.060* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 3rd of February,
*00:48.060- 00:56.160* :  we need help to find this monkey. If you've heard him, please give us a call. The simmian
*00:56.160- 01:02.000* :  saga of King UC Cole, the macaque monkey that escaped from a Scottish wildlife park and captured
*01:02.000- 01:07.140* :  world attention. Some positive news from the Antarctic. We have a couple of satellites that
*01:07.140- 01:12.600* :  was around the earth and what scientists do is they rummage through those pictures looking for
*01:12.600- 01:18.120* :  patches of poo. Because where there's poo, there are penguins, also in this podcast.
*01:18.120- 01:23.380* :  People online have been inspired by her courage, her sense of adventure and her attitude that
*01:23.580- 01:28.220* :  you're never too old to learn something new. The Chinese woman who's become known as the motorbike
*01:28.220- 01:34.160* :  granny, also the red-legged frog in Oregon and the superhuman efforts to protect it.
*01:39.080- 01:44.600* :  And we begin with the adventures of Honshu, the Japanese snow monkey that escaped from a wildlife
*01:44.600- 01:50.220* :  park in the Scottish Highlands and who for more than five days was the subject of a big search
*01:50.220- 01:55.080* :  operation and quite a lot of internet amusement. Harry Bly has been following the saga.
*01:58.140- 02:03.520* :  If you were trying to catch a monkey, you might think of baiting a trap with a banana and waiting
*02:03.520- 02:13.680* :  with a large net. The Highland Wildlife Park instead deployed drones fitted with thermal imaging
*02:13.680- 02:21.540* :  cameras to scour the local area for the fugitive and made this appeal on national radio.
*02:21.820- 02:25.920* :  Hello, my name's Dr. Kirstie Graham. We need help to find this monkey.
*02:26.680- 02:32.940* :  If you've heard him, please give us a call. But let's go from the beginning.
*02:32.940- 02:38.400* :  The Japanese macaque or snow monkey, named Honshu, found his way out of the enclosure
*02:38.400- 02:43.980* :  last Sunday morning. Later that day in the nearby village of King Craig, there was a sighting.
*02:44.040- 02:52.860* :  Oh, no way. This is insane. I need a bird feed.
*02:53.680- 02:54.800* :  Is he going to trash that feeder?
*02:55.740- 02:57.480* :  He cares. So awesome.
*02:58.560- 03:03.380* :  When the monkey was spotted in Karl Nagel's garden, three and a half kilometers up the road
*03:03.380- 03:08.740* :  from the wildlife park. I was awoken by a call from my daughter saying there's a monkey on
*03:08.740- 03:13.300* :  your street, dad, because it'd been seen on a local Facebook group posted in the garden across
*03:13.300- 03:16.600* :  the street. And I was like, what are the chances? Came to my patio and we were making
*03:16.600- 03:18.940* :  no inwards indeed shots to see a monkey going for my nuts.
*03:18.940- 03:25.820* :  Online, people went bananas for the story of the runaway monkey. One social media user created an
*03:25.820- 03:31.460* :  AI-generated picture of a monkey wearing a Scottish tartan-kilt, a woolen cardigan,
*03:31.460- 03:37.040* :  and running away from police officers. Gal Badahee is a research fellow at the University of
*03:37.040- 03:43.620* :  St Andrews and an expert in primate behaviour. They're similar to chimpanzees and humans as primates
*03:43.620- 03:48.960* :  in that they live in large social groups. So why did Honshu find the need to run away?
*03:49.300- 03:55.960* :  Group dynamics can vary a lot depending on the time of year, what kind of conflicts or
*03:55.960- 04:01.720* :  relationships are happening. So I don't know exactly what causes particular escape.
*04:01.820- 04:08.800* :  It might have something to do with relationships going on in the group. It might be that he was just
*04:08.800- 04:14.660* :  a bit curious. Experts at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which runs the park, say
*04:14.660- 04:18.680* :  fights are not uncommon at this time of year, which is breeding season.
*04:19.840- 04:24.600* :  On Thursday morning, five days after the macaque went missing, news came in.
*04:25.540- 04:30.840* :  BBC News at two o'clock, a monkey that had been missing in the highlands for more than five days
*04:30.840- 04:33.580* :  has been recaptured. The Japanese macaque.
*04:33.660- 04:39.440* :  The newspaper The Daily Star ran the headline, wild monkey on a bender rescued after five days on
*04:39.440- 04:45.280* :  the loose in Scotland. Honshu had been found alive just over three kilometres from the park,
*04:45.640- 04:49.660* :  in yet another person's garden. This time it was that of Stephanie Bunyan.
*04:49.840- 04:56.780* :  He looked a little bit sad. He wasn't worried. Just interested, I suppose, looking in, I don't know
*04:56.780- 05:02.820* :  if he wanted to come in in the warm or not. Stephanie had accidentally lured Honshu to her bird feeder
*05:03.300- 05:08.640* :  after leaving leftover Yorkshire puddings out overnight. Just ten minutes after calling the wildlife
*05:08.640- 05:15.040* :  park, drone operators arrived at her house, followed by park keepers. Honshu was shot with a
*05:15.040- 05:21.320* :  tranquilizer dart, sedated and taken back to the park's vet. After dodging heat-seeking drones,
*05:21.320- 05:26.580* :  rangers with nets, and eating bird feed and Yorkshire puddings, and inspiring some very
*05:26.580- 05:31.240* :  creative artwork, Honshu's adventure had finally come to an end.
*05:31.840- 05:37.140* :  That report by Harry Bly. And from one elusive monkey took quite a lot of new penguins.
*05:37.140- 05:42.700* :  Four new colonies of emperor penguins have been identified in Antarctica. And scientists believe
*05:42.700- 05:47.080* :  that means they now know the whereabouts of all the world's remaining breeding pairs.
*05:47.500- 05:52.780* :  Here's our science correspondent Jonathan Amos. The Antarctic is big, and it's remote too,
*05:53.040- 05:58.560* :  so it's not an easy place to go and walk and look for penguins. So you do it via satellite,
*05:59.320- 06:03.900* :  and they're constantly taking pictures of the Antarctic, and what scientists do is they rummage
*06:03.900- 06:09.760* :  through those pictures, looking for patches of poo, Jackie, basically. So from about,
*06:09.760- 06:16.340* :  ah, so from several hundred kilometers up, you can't see the individual penguin,
*06:16.880- 06:21.700* :  but if a large group of them huddle together, and they start defecating on the white eyes,
*06:22.200- 06:27.360* :  then that brown patch will become apparent to a satellite. So that's essentially how they
*06:27.360- 06:33.280* :  find these colonies of emperor penguins by looking for poo. And that's what the scientists have
*06:33.280- 06:37.460* :  done. They've been looking and looking and looking, and they've found a further four which brings
*06:37.460- 06:43.460* :  the total to 66. Now it's likely, if you look at the distribution of those colonies,
*06:44.080- 06:48.720* :  that they've found pretty much all of them, certainly all of the significant nesting sites
*06:48.780- 06:54.340* :  around the Antarctic. And this discovery, is it good news? What can we do with this knowledge?
*06:55.120- 06:59.940* :  It's good news that we're finding penguins and continue to find them, these emperors, but emperors
*06:59.940- 07:06.600* :  are, they're kind of an icon of climate change. In the sense that they're perhaps the penguin species
*07:06.600- 07:13.340* :  that is most vulnerable to the losses of ice in a warming world. Okay, Jonathan, this is the
*07:13.340- 07:20.120* :  happy part. Tell me something happy. You can't do anything about something unless you can measure it.
*07:20.360- 07:25.800* :  And knowing where all of these colonies are is a boon to conservation. The key thing here,
*07:25.800- 07:30.340* :  I think, that we're learning about the emperors is that they're quite dynamic and adaptive.
*07:31.160- 07:36.560* :  So if they get into trouble, they will look for new sites. They're not dumb. They don't
*07:36.560- 07:42.020* :  sort of bash their heads against the ice wall. They will go looking for new nesting sites.
*07:42.540- 07:49.820* :  And as it says, we are seeing certain groupings find new places to do the breeding. There's a
*07:49.820- 07:55.940* :  famous one called Halley Bay, which at one stage was, I think, the second largest emperor colony
*07:55.940- 08:02.660* :  in the Antarctic, completely wiped out in 2016. And they've finally found some ice where
*08:02.900- 08:08.460* :  they're setting up a pioneer colony, a new one. So that is good news. We should be happy
*08:08.740- 08:13.720* :  about that, Jackie, that emperors, if they can find a way, they will find a way.
*08:14.320- 08:20.700* :  That was Jonathan Amos. Now, think motorbikes, the freedom of the open road and cool rebellion.
*08:20.700- 08:25.280* :  And to the pantheon of Biker legends, the Mavericks and the free spirits,
*08:25.280- 08:30.700* :  it's time to add Lior Shueying, a woman who has become something of a sensation in China,
*08:30.700- 08:35.580* :  where she is also known as the motorbike grandma. Our China media analyst,
*08:35.580- 08:37.340* :  Carrie Allen, takes up the story.
*08:42.380- 08:48.260* :  This is Lior Shueying. She's 62 years old, and she's become a huge sensation online in China,
*08:48.260- 08:53.440* :  because of her adventures traveling all over the country by herself, on her motorbike.
*09:00.380- 09:04.580* :  She's originally from a small village on the outskirts of Bojo in central Anhui province,
*09:05.140- 09:10.760* :  and she only got her motorbike license for the first time in 2021, just before her 60th birthday.
*09:11.820- 09:16.320* :  2021 was a year that many of us remember as being the middle of the global pandemic.
*09:17.100- 09:20.040* :  It was a time when people all over the world were discovering new hobbies,
*09:20.480- 09:25.560* :  drawing, baking, gardening, Lior Shueying's decision to learn how to ride a motorbike,
*09:25.560- 09:28.840* :  came at a time when China had strict zero COVID policies in place.
*09:29.380- 09:33.460* :  People were nervous about catching COVID-19 in public places and on public transport,
*09:33.920- 09:36.980* :  as one case could lead to huge communities of people being locked down.
*09:37.980- 09:41.500* :  So you might think that her decision to learn this new hobby was a way of feeling
*09:41.500- 09:44.900* :  free at a time when much of the country was feeling very much under lockdown.
*09:45.840- 09:50.980* :  But she's told media how, when she was younger, it was always her dream to learn how to ride a motorbike.
*09:51.540- 09:55.100* :  She'd often looked at other people's bikes and thought, wow, that's really cool.
*09:55.840- 10:00.260* :  But she's simply not had the time to learn, and then before she knew it, she'd had four children,
*10:00.520- 10:02.260* :  and life had simply got in the way.
*10:03.300- 10:06.420* :  When she first got her license, she kept its secret from her kids,
*10:06.820- 10:10.980* :  but then decided to tell them that she was going to ride from Jijang in the east of the country,
*10:11.380- 10:13.340* :  all the way down to Guangdong in the south.
*10:19.140- 10:21.620* :  That's more than a thousand kilometers if you travel directly,
*10:22.100- 10:26.260* :  but she wanted to see lots of cities along the way, places she'd heard and read about.
*10:26.740- 10:29.780* :  She said her children had been a little bit worried, but she'd said,
*10:30.000- 10:34.400* :  don't panic, I'll ride slowly, and she's told media, I've got very strong legs.
*10:35.140- 10:40.120* :  And she was hooked. Within the first year, she managed to travel more than 20,000 kilometers.
*10:40.720- 10:42.220* :  That's more than 12,000 miles.
*10:47.100- 10:49.000* :  This is so describing some of the places she saw.
*10:49.980- 10:51.980* :  And since then, she's only broadened her horizons.
*10:52.420- 10:55.820* :  Her biggest journey to date has been to travel from Jijang again in the east,
*10:56.020- 10:57.240* :  all the way to Tibet.
*10:58.080- 11:01.720* :  If you look at a map of China, this is pretty much going from the far east of the country,
*11:01.940- 11:06.460* :  all the way through to the west, and she said that the whole journey was 12,000 kilometers,
*11:06.980- 11:11.140* :  and she'd managed to make it to La Sa, one of the highest cities in terms of altitude in the world.
*11:11.940- 11:15.380* :  People online have been inspired by her courage, her sense of adventure,
*11:15.840- 11:18.660* :  and her attitude that you're never too old to learn something new.
*11:19.380- 11:21.320* :  She's been given the nickname motorbike grandma,
*11:21.840- 11:26.120* :  and people on the popular social network waybo have called her cool, sassy and cute.
*11:26.900- 11:31.000* :  She's one of the legion of fans and has told media how she's met other riders along the way.
*11:32.000- 11:36.140* :  So far, she's covered two-thirds of the country and seen more than a hundred different cities,
*11:36.760- 11:38.400* :  so there's plenty more to rain for her to cover.
*11:39.040- 11:42.800* :  And the Urshweying says she wants to see more of the country while she still can,
*11:43.300- 11:46.300* :  saying that riding a motorbike makes her feel happy, free,
*11:47.020- 11:48.340* :  and like she's following her dreams.
*11:53.300- 11:55.880* :  Carrie Allen, on the story of Urshweying.
*11:56.680- 12:00.060* :  Now, some of the week's other notable stories, you might remember that in the last
*12:00.060- 12:03.720* :  edition of the HappyPod, we mentioned the Japanese craft that landed on the moon,
*12:03.720- 12:07.580* :  but which came down in such a way that its solar panels couldn't generate electricity.
*12:07.580- 12:12.240* :  Well, hold your horses, because since then, it has managed to resume operations.
*12:12.240- 12:16.980* :  Its thought-the-craft solar cells are working again due to a shift in lighting conditions
*12:17.380- 12:18.920* :  that allowed it to catch sunlight.
*12:19.380- 12:24.260* :  Also, a new report that suggests playing a musical instrument or singing can help keep the
*12:24.260- 12:29.600* :  brain healthy in older age. A report in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry
*12:29.900- 12:35.140* :  suggests that practicing and reading music may help sustain good memory and the ability
*12:35.140- 12:40.920* :  to solve complex tasks. And we've talked before on the HappyPod about the possibilities
*12:40.920- 12:46.400* :  of the gene-splicing technique, CRISPR. Now, a small study in New Zealand, the Netherlands,
*12:46.400- 12:51.460* :  and the UK has shown a life-changing reduction in symptoms of angiardema,
*12:51.460- 12:56.380* :  a genetic disorder that causes painful and unpredictable swelling attacks.
*12:57.000- 13:01.560* :  It's hoped that the therapy also has big potential for treating other genetic conditions, too.
*13:02.360- 13:07.720* :  Well done to the users of a sauna boat that came to the rescue after a Tesla plunged into a
*13:07.720- 13:14.180* :  fjord in Norway. Yes, a sauna boat is apparently a thing. The car sank into the water in Oslo,
*13:14.380- 13:18.640* :  the driver and the passenger were pulled from the chili water and were able to warm up in the
*13:18.640- 13:24.760* :  sauna afterwards. And history was made on Tuesday at the Spectacular up Heliar Fire Festival in
*13:24.760- 13:29.560* :  Shetland, Scotland. It's part of a series of events to mark the end of the Yule season
*13:29.560- 13:34.820* :  and to celebrate Shetland's Norse heritage, involving torchlit processions and the burning
*13:34.820- 13:40.340* :  of a replica Viking galley. And this year, for the first time, women and girls were part of the
*13:40.340- 13:46.820* :  lead Yule squad through the main town, Lowec. Jenna Moore is 16. Very grateful to be able to
*13:46.820- 13:50.820* :  participate in the squad this year with lots of family and friends. It's a very good day,
*13:50.820- 13:54.940* :  sunshine, and we're all happy. I'm quite aware of the historic significance of it. I'm very
*13:54.940- 14:00.340* :  grateful as my gunner was Yarra in 1982 and now dad 2024. I'm very grateful to be participating
*14:00.340- 14:06.240* :  in the squad this year. It is the biggest fire festival in Europe. It is stunning and I will share
*14:12.140- 14:16.740* :  a link to some pictures. Still to come in this podcast, the woman blazing a trail as commentator
*14:16.740- 14:21.600* :  and match analyst at the Africa Cup of Nations. I started out playing football as the only
*14:21.600- 14:26.600* :  villain of boys team. So those faces for me don't intimidate me. I hold my own because I know
*14:32.960- 14:37.220* :  that I've got something to offer. Well football at Afcon. Well football at Afcon brings you all the
*14:37.220- 14:45.020* :  drama and excitement of the Africa Cup of Nations festival of football. Join me, John Bennett and
*14:45.020- 14:50.220* :  guests every match day for the latest reaction and analysis of this year's Africa Cup of Nations
*14:50.280- 14:57.700* :  in Ivory Coast. All the action on and off the pitch. World football at Afcon from the BBC World
*14:57.700- 15:07.620* :  Service. Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts. To Portland, Oregon in the US now,
*15:07.840- 15:13.400* :  whether days are getting longer and the weather a little warmer and a young frog's fancy turns
*15:13.400- 15:18.720* :  to thoughts of reproduction. And for the red-legged frog and yes, I will share a picture,
*15:19.140- 15:24.120* :  it isn't that easy. To get from the woodland where they usually live to the still water where
*15:24.120- 15:30.780* :  they lay their eggs, they have to cross an increasingly busy highway. Tim Gresseth of the Oregon Wildlife
*15:30.780- 15:36.060* :  Foundation tells about the people trying to help. One individual in particular was out for an
*15:36.060- 15:41.260* :  evening stroll and noticed these frogs for the very first time and this person became extremely
*15:41.260- 15:46.040* :  concerned about the fact that the frogs were on the road and then discovered that they were moving
*15:46.040- 15:52.740* :  to a highway and attempting to make the crossing this highway with lots of traffic. So this local
*15:52.740- 15:59.020* :  residents got some local agency people together and said it was a solution here and they struck on
*15:59.020- 16:06.300* :  this solution which is to ban together a group of local citizens who would monitor for the movement
*16:06.300- 16:12.280* :  of these frogs and then they would start collecting the frogs and buckets and drive the frogs
*16:12.280- 16:18.640* :  across highway 30 to the wetland and release them there. Now these frogs make a return journey
*16:18.640- 16:24.520* :  two to three weeks after they finish their meeting and so the volunteers bring them back up
*16:24.520- 16:30.300* :  into the forest area and release them there. You though, Tim, you want to build a tunnel. Tell us a
*16:30.300- 16:34.640* :  bit more about what that would mean, how big it would be, how difficult it will be to get it built.
*16:35.360- 16:41.880* :  So putting a crossing underneath the highway is a solution that we've hit on. It's not an
*16:41.880- 16:48.740* :  insignificant task to both get the permissions to construct something like we're talking about,
*16:49.260- 16:54.140* :  but also to make it happen from an engineering perspective and you know where it needs to be
*16:54.140- 17:00.500* :  located. Now the heavy lift is actually designed to make sure it's something that is conducive for
*17:00.880- 17:05.620* :  frog use and then raising the money needed to actually finish engineering and then get it
*17:05.620- 17:11.500* :  constructed. The other thing that we know is that we have very passionate people and I expect them
*17:11.500- 17:16.380* :  not only to be donors but to be advocates for this crossing. I think it's going to be hard for
*17:16.380- 17:22.420* :  agencies to ignore the need and I do believe we'll get this done. I do hope the frogs appreciate
*17:22.420- 17:29.020* :  the effort that you're putting in for them. Now I have to ask this as someone who has pet myself and
*17:29.020- 17:35.340* :  I buy things for them and then they turn up their noses. If you build a tunnel, are you absolutely
*17:35.340- 17:41.760* :  sure that they'll use it? This is not a novel solution. So across the United States there are
*17:41.760- 17:48.120* :  somewhere between 150 and 160 passages like this that have been constructed for a variety of different
*17:48.120- 17:55.440* :  amphibian reptiles species. There is documented use by amphibians and reptiles. So we know if we
*17:55.440- 18:02.900* :  build it correctly that it will get used. How much money will it cost to get something like this
*18:03.420- 18:07.860* :  constructed? It's probably going to be somewhere between one and a half to two million dollars
*18:08.820- 18:15.000* :  for to complete engineering and design for the structure and the estimated cost for installation
*18:15.060- 18:21.280* :  is probably somewhere between eight and ten million dollars. So we're talking all together
*18:21.280- 18:29.000* :  about twelve million dollars to raise. Wow that is such a lot of money but if you're successful
*18:29.000- 18:34.860* :  it saves this special little frog. Absolutely absolutely and make a lot of people happy.
*18:35.360- 18:42.540* :  So you have a lot of work to do, a lot of fundraising to do. If you do get it built will you invite
*18:42.540- 18:50.020* :  us to the inauguration? I absolutely will do that. Absolutely. Love to have you there. We are so there.
*18:50.020- 18:55.000* :  That was Tim Gresseth of the Oregon Wildlife Foundation and that story came to us courtesy of
*18:55.000- 19:00.400* :  listener Crystal, true love. So thank you Crystal. Now if you're on a ventilator you are susceptible
*19:00.400- 19:05.860* :  to dangerous acquired infections because you can't just cough your airways clear when you need to
*19:06.420- 19:12.500* :  and that bothered Indian innovator Nitesh Jhangeer. So he came up with a system harnessing some very clever
*19:12.500- 19:18.560* :  artificial intelligence to prevent the problem arising and for that he has been recognized by the
*19:18.560- 19:24.580* :  Royal Academy of Engineering as a trailblazer. He told us about his inspiration. I was born in
*19:24.580- 19:31.040* :  really the mode area of the state in Rajasthan. So the nearest hospital to us was around 180
*19:31.040- 19:36.600* :  kilometres away. So I've seen a lot of people in my family around my village losing their life
*19:36.600- 19:41.300* :  because they don't get access to good quality treatment on time and that's what led me to get
*19:41.300- 19:46.400* :  into the field of healthcare where I feel that technology and healthcare can come together
*19:46.400- 19:53.360* :  and increase access to high quality healthcare to everyone. What was the problem that you were trying
*19:53.360- 20:00.520* :  to fix? There were many patients who were coming to the ICU who were on ventilator but losing
*20:00.520- 20:05.240* :  their lives because they were acquiring a deadly infection from the ICU called ventilator
*20:05.240- 20:10.840* :  associated pneumonia which is the most common and the most deadly hospital acquired infection
*20:11.760- 20:15.940* :  responsible for more than a million deaths. And that's where I saw that this is something which
*20:15.940- 20:22.340* :  is secondary should not happen and what as an engineer as a technologist we can do to reduce
*20:22.340- 20:27.820* :  this problem as much as possible. Okay so what did you come up with? So we came up with this device
*20:27.820- 20:33.660* :  so we call it back care which is world's only automated device which is in a move excessive saliva
*20:33.660- 20:39.980* :  and secretions from patients were on ventilator while doing mouthwash. So we are using quite
*20:39.980- 20:44.960* :  advanced AI algorithms because if it is done more than what is required it can lead to suction
*20:44.960- 20:50.800* :  induced injury so more is bad less is also bad and by doing this it reduces chances of acquiring
*20:50.800- 20:55.660* :  this deadly infection quite significantly. Now the Royal Academy of Engineering has described
*20:55.660- 21:01.000* :  you Nitesh as a trailblazer what does that mean for you? The organization's line Royal Academy
*21:01.000- 21:06.620* :  is enabling us to these two more and more people and enhance our impacts. Our products have already
*21:06.620- 21:11.400* :  impacted thousands of lives positively but right now majorly our operations are in India but we
*21:11.400- 21:17.640* :  are entering into US, UK and European market along with a big focus on sub saran africa so we can
*21:17.640- 21:23.580* :  ensure that every baby born every patient who is a nice you would receive the gold standard care
*21:23.580- 21:29.200* :  regardless of where they are born everybody should receive the same care rather they are at Oxford
*21:29.200- 21:37.360* :  or they are in remote part of Uganda or India. Nitesh Jangir in Bangalore the ocean is endlessly
*21:37.360- 21:44.300* :  astonishing and even now remarkably little of it has been explored by humans. That's where the
*21:44.300- 21:50.860* :  RV Falcon 2 comes in it's a research ship run by the Schmidt Ocean Institute which is sending
*21:50.860- 21:57.940* :  an underwater robot to depths of 4500 meters and it's already yielding amazing results like the
*21:57.940- 22:03.640* :  recent discovery of four new species of deep sea octopus and you can watch its discoveries
*22:04.140- 22:11.240* :  Dr. Jyotika Vemay executive director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute told my colleague Amal Rajan
*22:11.240- 22:20.440* :  about the RV Falcon 2. It's 110 meters in length and it's about seven stories tall so it's a massive
*22:20.960- 22:27.060* :  floating laboratory basically it's got state of the art equipment on board over 200 square meters
*22:27.060- 22:33.520* :  of lab space and dozens of scientific sensors and as you mentioned our underwater robot
*22:34.140- 22:42.540* :  ROV Sebastian ROV stands for remotely operated vehicle so lots of capabilities and we offer it
*22:42.540- 22:49.000* :  at no cost to scientists from around the world to conduct their research and test cutting edge marine
*22:49.000- 22:54.980* :  technology and when you're pursuing parts of our planet which are unknown what are your aims is
*22:54.980- 22:58.580* :  your aim to sort of see what you find out or do you have a suspicion and intuition that you
*22:58.580- 23:04.100* :  might find out specific things and you go after those things the ocean is a huge area of our planet
*23:04.100- 23:12.380* :  covers 71% of the surface of earth and it's mostly unknown only about 5% has really been explored
*23:12.380- 23:18.440* :  and so as you mentioned there's countless new marine species out there there's land forms we've
*23:18.440- 23:25.260* :  not yet even seen by the human eye so our aim is to boldly explore our unknown ocean
*23:25.580- 23:29.760* :  just tell us what this vessel actually does so you'd send it is vast I'd know I'd be so big
*23:29.760- 23:36.380* :  you send it into the the murky depths and how does it transmit the information back what kind
*23:36.380- 23:41.480* :  of information does it get you so we have the research vessel and then after the research vessel
*23:41.480- 23:47.260* :  we deploy the underwater robot and it's tethered to the vessel and so we have a great communication
*23:47.260- 23:53.560* :  system on board the vessel and it sends back video images and these video images are actually
*23:53.560- 24:00.380* :  transmitted live so anyone anywhere in the world with an internet access can watch at the same time
*24:00.380- 24:06.360* :  as the scientists who are on board and see for the first time for the first time for humans
*24:06.380- 24:12.640* :  some of these places and discover as the scientists narrate what they're seeing it's amazing
*24:13.580- 24:18.440* :  it is indeed and that was Dr. Diotika via my executive director of the Schmidt Ocean
*24:18.440- 24:23.900* :  Institute and you can see the live stream on the Schmidt Institute YouTube channel
*24:24.920- 24:29.480* :  the Africa Cup of Nations Football Championship is currently underway in ivory coast and it's
*24:29.480- 24:35.220* :  been full of surprises so far history has been made both on and off the pitch and one of the
*24:35.220- 24:41.820* :  groundbreakers is South African Amanda Lamini she used to be a player herself and has become the
*24:41.820- 24:48.220* :  first woman to commentate at Afghan she's been speaking to Audrey Brown what motivated me a lot
*24:48.580- 24:53.560* :  was the fact that there are these existing stereotypes back home that football players are not
*24:53.560- 24:58.980* :  educated or we don't like to read or we don't like to go to school so I think it was very important
*24:58.980- 25:04.500* :  for me to change the narrative and I went above and beyond just media training I had to read books
*25:04.760- 25:08.880* :  I had to read newspapers if I read newspapers it was not necessarily the back page of sports
*25:09.180- 25:14.540* :  I go into finances and just read how you construct sentences and it was important to me to try
*25:14.540- 25:19.560* :  and change the narrative now you're the first woman to do commentary at a men's African
*25:19.560- 25:25.760* :  Cup of Nations how has that gone down because we know that those spaces are quite closely guarded
*25:25.760- 25:31.580* :  and lots of people don't like being told things by women sure it's been a long time coming to be
*25:31.580- 25:37.340* :  honest because like you say there are certain barriers that women have had to overcome in the
*25:37.560- 25:43.740* :  sports space and entirety and one of which still exists is an opinion from a female in the sporting
*25:43.740- 25:50.540* :  space especially football one women are not paid equally as well in football spaces so who would
*25:50.540- 25:55.920* :  want to listen to a woman speak football but for me I've been in spaces a lot of times where I've
*25:55.920- 26:00.560* :  just been the only girl I started out playing football as the only girl in a boys team so those
*26:00.560- 26:05.300* :  spaces for me don't intimidate me I hold my own because I know that I've got something to offer
*26:05.300- 26:10.340* :  and I've just trusted the process that at the right time someone would have to step up and it
*26:10.340- 26:14.860* :  would be important that it would ever guess that opportunity someone who's had to go through all
*26:14.860- 26:21.640* :  the stages of what it's like to be an only woman probably in the male dominated space to once you
*26:21.640- 26:26.860* :  just hold your own and you really do your research you prepare well they start respecting actually what
*26:26.860- 26:31.080* :  you have to bring on the park it's no longer just our no real commentator because she's a woman
*26:31.080- 26:36.640* :  she's coming to add a female voice but once you actually know what you're talking about that's
*26:36.640- 26:41.640* :  when they start respecting you're not accommodating you anymore so tell us about the memorable moments
*26:41.640- 26:50.760* :  for you at Afkhan sofa sure it has to be I guess the fans man I'm so in love with the fans even just
*26:50.780- 26:55.880* :  the city that we ask and Pedro the town that we add it's not longer just a town that belongs to
*26:55.880- 27:01.480* :  people of Kortobwa it's Morocco town because the Moroccans are everywhere so the fans are really
*27:01.480- 27:06.580* :  bored you know the fire and the passion at the stadiums it's just a thing of bringing people together
*27:06.580- 27:10.100* :  and I'm just so happy to be part of it Amanda Flemini
*27:13.100- 27:18.780* :  and that's it from us for now but we will be back next week however it'll be one day later
*27:19.160- 27:24.220* :  and here's Celia happened to explain why sometimes to understand what's really going on
*27:24.220- 27:30.740* :  inside China it helps to look at the numbers for a special edition of the Global News podcast
*27:30.740- 27:36.520* :  just in time for the Lunar New Year I've gathered eight numbers to understand China
*27:37.080- 27:44.380* :  and some amazing people to explain why those digits matter from nine years of falling marriage rates
*27:44.380- 27:50.460* :  it's becoming more difficult especially if you're a woman to get a divorce that's another reason
*27:50.460- 27:58.400* :  that marriage is no longer so appealing to China's 7.2 million empty apartments there's a lot
*27:58.400- 28:04.820* :  of apartment and buildings to just build there and maybe somebody buy it but no one actually leaving it
*28:04.980- 28:10.880* :  that's eight numbers to understand China coming next week you'll be able to find it by searching
*28:10.880- 28:18.700* :  for the Global News podcast or wherever you get your BBC podcast thank you Celia and the happy
*28:18.700- 28:25.300* :  pod will be back one day later if you would like to say hello to us or suggest a story please do
*28:25.300- 28:32.740* :  our address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk this edition was mixed by Jack Graysmark the producers
*28:32.740- 28:38.600* :  were Anna Murphy and Harry Blie our editor is Karen Martin I'm Jackie Leonard and until next time
*28:39.040- 28:40.620* :  one day later remember goodbye
