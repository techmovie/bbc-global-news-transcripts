*01:45.740- 01:55.180* :  Service. I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Sunday the 11th of February, these are on main
*01:55.180- 02:00.960* :  stories. A six-year-old girl who went missing in Guards last month has been confirmed dead.
*02:01.720- 02:07.360* :  Tension remains high in Pakistan as the country awaits the delayed results of Thursday's election.
*02:07.360- 02:13.780* :  The two biggest parties are both claiming victory. To have Hungary's leading female politicians,
*02:13.780- 02:19.700* :  including the president Katalyn Novak, have resigned over their decision to pardon a man
*02:19.700- 02:28.060* :  jailed for covering up child abuse. Also in this podcast. In the end we have two Arab teams from
*02:28.060- 02:34.820* :  this region making it to the final. The stadium was full and this is something which doesn't happen
*02:34.820- 02:41.080* :  here very often. Katar has retained football's Asian Cup by beating Jordan on home turf.
*02:45.100- 02:51.600* :  We begin in Gaza and the story of Hindrajab which captured the imagination of many people around
*02:51.600- 02:57.840* :  the world. Nearly two weeks ago the six-year-old Palestinian was in a car with relatives when it came
*02:57.840- 03:04.080* :  under fire in Gaza City. She called the rescue services saying, I'm so scared, please come.
*03:04.080- 03:10.840* :  They were some of the last words heard from her. On Saturday her death was confirmed. A short time
*03:10.840- 03:16.520* :  after this news emerged our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson filed this report from Jerusalem.
*03:16.980- 03:23.420* :  There are some 28,000 people who are now thought to have been killed in Gaza and this is the story of
*03:23.420- 03:30.120* :  just one little girl but it's really captured attention. I think because of those audio recordings
*03:30.120- 03:35.900* :  that were made public of her asking for help and also because of this shrinking glimmer of hope
*03:36.640- 03:43.260* :  she might still be alive. Twelve days after the family car she was traveling in came face-to-face
*03:43.260- 03:50.900* :  with Israeli tanks. Israel's army today pulled back from that area of Gaza City and rescue workers
*03:51.280- 03:57.460* :  went in. Witnesses say that dozens of bodies were recovered from the streets and buildings there.
*03:58.160- 04:06.760* :  One of them they say was hints. A child's voice alone in the midst of war.
*04:07.620- 04:14.380* :  Hiding in her uncle's car among the bodies of her relatives the last hours of six-year-old hindrajab
*04:14.900- 04:24.940* :  were dominated by one plea. Come and let me. Recordings of her calls with emergency services sparked
*04:24.940- 04:34.360* :  a 12-day campaign to find her. Today as Israeli forces left the area in Gaza City paramedics
*04:34.360- 04:41.000* :  went in. They found hints body with those of her relatives in the black Kia car she'd been
*04:41.000- 04:45.940* :  traveling in. It's front shattered but it holds scattered across its side.
*04:45.980- 04:56.280* :  We found six decomposed bodies including girls, women and one man. The girl hind she was identified
*04:56.320- 05:03.000* :  among the decomposed bodies indicating they had been subjected to gunfire and shelling.
*05:03.680- 05:11.440* :  Here are the martyrs. Now there are all bones. The dead badly damaged and decomposed were buried
*05:11.440- 05:19.260* :  quickly. No funeral, just grief and anger. And from his mother with Sam a demand that someone be
*05:19.260- 05:26.700* :  held accountable. For every person who heard my voice my daughter's pleading voice yet did not
*05:26.700- 05:34.100* :  trust you her. I will question them before God on the day of judgment, Netanyahu, Biden and all
*05:34.100- 05:41.660* :  those who collaborated against us against Gaza and its people. I pray against them from the depth
*05:41.660- 05:47.740* :  of my heart. Hind is one of thousands of children killed in 18 weeks of war in Gaza.
*05:50.280- 05:56.300* :  What are you waiting for? Hind was killed. How many more mothers are you waiting for to feel this
*05:56.340- 06:00.360* :  pain? How many more children do you want to get killed?
*06:01.620- 06:06.620* :  Near where Hind was found was the ambulance car that was sent to get her. The bodies of its
*06:06.620- 06:13.780* :  crew members Yuzif Al-Zeno and Ahmed Al-Madoun still inside. Nibal Fasach, a spokeswoman for the
*06:13.780- 06:19.800* :  Palestinian Red Crescent, said Yuzif and Ahmed had radioed in as they approached to say they could
*06:19.800- 06:26.120* :  see Hind in the car before the line was cut in a burst of gunfire. They were deliberately
*06:26.120- 06:33.260* :  targeted. Although our ambulance have very clearly the Red Crescent emblem and top of our ambulances
*06:33.260- 06:40.580* :  and we had it clearly also in all sides of the ambulance. Nibal Fasach told me it had taken several
*06:40.580- 06:46.840* :  hours to agree coordination with the Israeli army to allow the ambulance through. We asked
*06:46.840- 06:55.220* :  Israel's army about this but received no response. The sounds of Hind is still here in my ear
*06:55.600- 07:02.600* :  and in all of our staff while she was appealing for us over three hours please come and get me
*07:02.600- 07:09.520* :  please come and get me. We felt helpless at that point and we tried our best to coordinate our safe
*07:09.520- 07:16.900* :  access. At the hospital where she waited for news of her daughter,
*07:17.380- 07:23.940* :  Hind's mother was Sam still holds the little pink bag she was keeping for her. Inside a notebook
*07:24.440- 07:31.760* :  where Hind had been practicing her handwriting. The six-year-old was killed days ago today. It was
*07:31.760- 07:39.060* :  hope that died. Lucy Williamson. In Tel Aviv on Saturday thousands demonstrated against the
*07:39.060- 07:44.440* :  government's handling of efforts to bring home from Gaza the Israeli hostages taken by her mass
*07:44.800- 07:54.040* :  on October the 7th. It's believed there are around 130 hostages still being held captive.
*07:54.800- 07:59.720* :  These protesters challenge Prime Minister Netanyahu's argument that total victory against
*07:59.720- 08:06.060* :  a mass in Gaza is the best way to bring them home. We trust him according to his own private
*08:06.060- 08:12.220* :  interest and not for us and this is very sad, very sad. We believe in the importance of a human
*08:12.220- 08:19.680* :  life here and we understand that the human life here is important in both sides and so if the
*08:19.680- 08:24.860* :  ceasefire is going to bring back home the hostages that's I think what we should do. In my opinion
*08:24.940- 08:34.200* :  and I think I represent many about the fact that he is not interested in the destiny of the
*08:34.200- 08:41.980* :  kidnapped at all. All he's interested in first place is to stay in power and keep on forever
*08:42.140- 08:48.160* :  for the last day upon Earth. In a separate development, Israelis carried out an air strike
*08:48.600- 08:54.600* :  almost 40 miles into Lebanon apparently to target a key Palestinian figure close to her mass.
*08:54.620- 09:00.820* :  He is said to have survived although three people were reportedly killed including a fighter with
*09:00.820- 09:06.000* :  the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group and there have been almost daily cross-border exchanges of
*09:06.000- 09:11.900* :  fire between Hezbollah and Israel since November. It's thought this attack was far deeper into the
*09:11.900- 09:17.020* :  Lebanese territory than normal. The Israeli military has yet to comment on the strike.
*09:18.500- 09:23.060* :  In the past week the United States has carried out a series of air raids that have killed 17
*09:23.060- 09:28.960* :  Iranian-backed militia men in Iraq as well as a precision drone strike in the capital Baghdad
*09:28.960- 09:34.700* :  that killed a senior commander or senior international correspondent Alla Gourant in the Iraqi
*09:34.700- 09:42.680* :  capital Baghdad. Been a very tense week there is a real feeling here of concern that one miscalculation
*09:42.680- 09:48.460* :  could cause a disaster. What's happening here is that Iraq is getting caught in the cross-fire
*09:48.460- 09:54.660* :  between U.S. forces and Iranian-backed militia that operate on Iraqi soil.
*09:55.320- 10:00.620* :  The beginning of the current escalation was the killing of three U.S. troops in Jordan
*10:00.620- 10:07.320* :  that was carried out by Iranian-backed militia. The U.S. vowed that they would retaliate and we
*10:07.320- 10:14.880* :  have seen that retaliation playing out in Syria but also here in Iraq where we had the first wave
*10:14.880- 10:22.660* :  of strikes that killed 17 militia fighters but then we had that surgical strike on the streets
*10:22.660- 10:29.160* :  of Baghdad here which targeted a senior militia commander turning his Jeep into a fireball.
*10:29.880- 10:33.920* :  Now the government is very concerned and not just the government I have to say many other people
*10:33.920- 10:40.320* :  we have spoken to share this concern that the tit for tat that is taking place here could push
*10:40.560- 10:47.020* :  Iraq into a conflict. Now since the killing of the militia leader the militia group here there's
*10:47.020- 10:52.500* :  an umbrella group in calling itself the Islamic resistance in Iraq and these are pro-Iranian militia
*10:52.880- 10:57.720* :  they have come out and said they are going to step up their attacks against U.S. forces.
*10:58.580- 11:04.280* :  On the other hand the Americans are saying we will continue to take necessary steps to protect
*11:04.280- 11:10.140* :  our own people. Now a key flashpoint here is the presence of U.S. troops they're here at the
*11:10.140- 11:16.080* :  invitation of the government there are about 2500 they're not in a combat role they are advisors
*11:16.780- 11:22.920* :  and they've been here since 2014 to help prevent a resurgence of the so-called Islamic state
*11:23.580- 11:29.280* :  but when I sat down with the Rax foreign minister Fouad Hussein I asked him if the government now
*11:29.280- 11:36.620* :  wants U.S. troops out. Now we want to have to start the negotiation on the basis of the
*11:36.620- 11:44.040* :  negotiation it will be decided and of course the end of the negotiation must be clear the majority
*11:44.040- 11:51.200* :  of Iraqi people they don't want to have foreign forces on Iraqi soil. But is it a Iraqi government
*11:51.200- 11:56.960* :  policy now that the troops should go and it's just a question of when. The troop one day must leave
*11:56.960- 12:07.600* :  this country at the end must be free from having foreign bases some has been invited and that's
*12:07.600- 12:14.640* :  valid for the American side some has not been invited. Going back to the issue of the U.S.
*12:14.640- 12:21.460* :  strikes that happened the Americans say they were targeting Iraqi militia that are pro-Iranian
*12:21.460- 12:28.320* :  that are on your soil and from your soil they are carrying out attacks on U.S. forces. Do you
*12:28.320- 12:34.600* :  accept that there are militias here that are officially part of your security forces but in fact
*12:34.600- 12:41.860* :  are armed and trained by Iran that are carrying out these attacks. Those militias they themselves
*12:42.220- 12:50.920* :  are announcing their attacks and they are also well known that they are or they have good
*12:51.420- 12:56.520* :  connection with the Iranian side. This is well known I cannot deny it that's true.
*12:57.400- 13:03.000* :  As we sit here now minister is it the case that your government does not have control over these
*13:03.100- 13:07.120* :  pro-Iranian militias that they are doing their own thing and you cannot stop them?
*13:07.620- 13:13.560* :  I think if nowadays you will talk with many political leaders they started to talk about this.
*13:14.100- 13:18.840* :  Many people they didn't dare to talk about. This is also a part of the reality in this country
*13:19.500- 13:27.840* :  but now we are talking about it and we are saying to them is to stop there. People there to say to
*13:27.840- 13:34.120* :  those guys is in trouble. I think all of them they got a message that if they were continuing
*13:35.560- 13:43.260* :  they would in the first place destroy the political process in Iraq and they will push this country
*13:43.260- 13:50.920* :  into a war while it is not our war and also the Iranian government. How real is that danger that
*13:50.920- 13:57.180* :  this tit-for-tat between the Iranians and the Americans on Iraqi soil could push this country
*13:57.180- 14:06.140* :  into conflict? That's the main problem to be honest. The tension nowadays between Iran and
*14:07.360- 14:15.740* :  the United States is very high. So I hope both sides will stop their attacks on the Iraqi soil and
*14:15.740- 14:22.980* :  they are not going to solve their problem on the Iraqi soil. We paid a very big price.
*14:23.840- 14:28.880* :  Dr Fuad Hussein, the Iraqi foreign minister, speaking to our senior international
*14:28.880- 14:36.380* :  correspondents, all are going. Next to Pakistan, there is tension and uncertainty in the country
*14:36.860- 14:41.780* :  as they continue to wait for the final results of first day's elections. On Saturday,
*14:41.780- 14:47.880* :  police in the city of Talangang in the Punjab province used tear gas to push back crowds
*14:47.880- 14:53.700* :  protesting against the delay. The demonstrators dispersed when they were told results would be
*14:53.700- 15:00.500* :  finalised on Sunday. The parties of the jailed former prime minister in Rancan and his rival
*15:00.500- 15:06.680* :  Nawaz Sharif are both claiming victory. Mr Sharif, who was thought to be favoured by the powerful
*15:06.680- 15:13.620* :  military, has called on smaller parties to help inform a unity government. These people in Lahore
*15:13.900- 15:19.320* :  urge the parties to get together to find a way forward. We are right now in a very critical
*15:20.440- 15:28.440* :  situation, both economically, security wise and on many other levels. So Pakistan political
*15:28.440- 15:34.960* :  parties really need to sit together. Pakistan can't support any kind of conflict, which is why I
*15:34.960- 15:41.840* :  keep repeating. We must all sit down together, settle these issues and bring Pakistan into the 21st
*15:41.840- 15:48.440* :  century. The head of the army is also words politicians to negotiate and show what he described
*15:48.440- 15:54.360* :  as maturity and unity. Here's our correspondent in Islamabad, Caroline Davies.
*15:58.880- 16:03.000* :  There's growing unrest in Pakistan where the full results of the election are yet to be released.
*16:03.000- 16:08.520* :  Police in the city of Talangang in Punjab used tear gas to push back crowds protesting against
*16:08.520- 16:13.420* :  the delay. In Rancan's independence have more seats than his rival Nawaz Sharif's PMLN
*16:13.420- 16:18.380* :  party, but Mr Khan's supporters claim the vote has been rigged to deprive them of a clear majority.
*16:18.380- 16:24.100* :  That is strongly denied by the authorities. At a news conference, Mr Khan's party declared its
*16:24.100- 16:28.520* :  intention to try to form a national government. We are not fighting with anyone.
*16:28.880- 16:34.420* :  The chairman Gohar Ali Khan. We are not against any institution. This is our country. Every institution
*16:34.420- 16:39.740* :  is so dear and near to us. We regard and respect every institution. We trust every institution.
*16:39.800- 16:44.560* :  We are just asking them to respect this mandate of the public. That's all. Nothing more, nothing
*16:44.560- 16:49.560* :  less. But it is not the only party trying to form a government. Nawaz Sharif has called for
*16:49.560- 16:55.040* :  other groups in parliament to form a coalition with his PMLN. The head of Pakistan's powerful army
*16:55.340- 16:59.640* :  appears to want a coalition, saying that the country would be well represented by a unified
*16:59.640- 17:05.240* :  government of all democratic forces. Many thought the military's favoured candidate was Mr Sharif.
*17:05.240- 17:09.840* :  The fact that he has fewer seats than his rival in Rancan suggests that the army's backing
*17:09.840- 17:12.840* :  was not enough to win. Caroline Davies.
*17:13.720- 17:19.540* :  Hungary's first female president, Katalyn Novak, has resigned. A mid-outrage over her decision
*17:19.540- 17:26.000* :  to pardon a man convicted of covering up child sexual abuse. Ms Novak, a close ally of the
*17:26.000- 17:31.640* :  nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, stepped down on live television. She told viewers,
*17:31.640- 17:40.120* :  she made a mistake. I apologise to those whom I may have offended and to all the victims who might
*17:40.120- 17:45.640* :  have felt that I didn't stand up for them. I have constantly advocated for the protection of children
*17:45.640- 17:52.600* :  and families. Today marks my final address to you as president, as I tender my resignation from
*17:52.600- 17:58.000* :  the post of president of the Republic. Another leading female politician from the same party
*17:58.000- 18:04.060* :  Yudid Vaga has also announced she's standing down. I heard more from our central Europe correspondent
*18:04.060- 18:12.020* :  Nick Thorpe, who's in Budapest. This was basically a presidential pardon issued last year on the occasion
*18:12.020- 18:19.040* :  of the Pope's visit to Hungary. President Novak pardoned 25 people and interestingly their names
*18:19.040- 18:25.440* :  just made public a week or so ago and it turned out that one of them was a man convicted as an
*18:25.440- 18:32.560* :  accomplice for helping cover up a sex abuse case in a children's home. So basically a pedophilia case.
*18:32.820- 18:38.020* :  This has been such a, it would be a scandal in any case, of course, but in this particular case,
*18:38.300- 18:44.800* :  Katalyn Novak, she's the former minister in charge of family policy and as president, she's made
*18:44.800- 18:51.000* :  and her government, the Fidesz government, have made the traditional family and protection of
*18:51.000- 18:55.860* :  children a cornerstone of their policy. And how serious is this for the government? It's very
*18:55.860- 19:01.300* :  serious, really, because not only has Katalyn Novak resigned as president, but Yudid Vaga,
*19:01.300- 19:07.340* :  another woman in Fidesz, a very high ranking woman in Fidesz, who's the former justice minister,
*19:07.660- 19:14.800* :  she also signed the same amnesty or clemency decision and she was due to lead the Fidesz,
*19:14.800- 19:21.220* :  the governing parties list in the European elections this June. So Fidesz have lost its two
*19:21.220- 19:28.180* :  most prominent female politicians, basically, in a matter of days, over an issue which is deeply
*19:28.180- 19:32.840* :  embarrassing and politically harmful for them. Clearly, this is an attempt at damage
*19:33.340- 19:38.340* :  limitation by Prime Minister Victor Aban, but it's nevertheless very embarrassing and a big blow
*19:38.340- 19:43.040* :  for him and his government. Unbriefly, it's significant that a senior female politician in
*19:43.040- 19:48.580* :  Hungary has resigned in this way. That's right. This is a very male-dominated society. There are
*19:48.580- 19:54.860* :  only 29 women deputies in parliament that's 14% against the European Union average. So a great
*19:54.860- 20:00.740* :  shortage of women in politics and for that reason too, a big blow for Hungary is well not just the
*20:00.740- 20:06.900* :  governing party. Nick Thorpe, Ukraine says seven people have died in a Russian drone attack
*20:06.900- 20:12.880* :  on the north-eastern city of Harkiv. The victims include a family of five. From Kiev,
*20:12.880- 20:16.280* :  a recent Europe correspondent Sarah Reinswood reports.
*20:16.280- 20:21.280* :  The youngest of the children killed in the Russian drone attack was a baby. His brothers were
*20:21.280- 20:26.920* :  seven and four. They all died in their home with their parents after a fire broke out and spread
*20:26.920- 20:32.300* :  too quickly for them to escape. In another house two pensioners were killed. A regional
*20:32.300- 20:37.580* :  police chief has talked about a hellish lava of diesel and petrol pouring down the street
*20:37.580- 20:43.180* :  after what's described as a large fuel depot nearby was hit by the drones. As the leak spread,
*20:43.180- 20:49.140* :  it set fire to homes and cars on several streets. Dozens of people were evacuated and buildings
*20:49.140- 20:55.500* :  destroyed. At least 10 drones were launched by Russia over Harkiv in this attack and two made
*20:55.500- 21:00.800* :  it through Ukraine's air defense systems. The city is so close to the Russian border, this little
*21:00.800- 21:06.240* :  time to intercept missiles or drones when they're launched. That's why many children now study
*21:06.240- 21:11.720* :  underground on the metro and Harkiv is even constructing a purpose built school beneath a sport

*21:25.820- 21:31.360* :  off the coast of Tobago, huge amount of oil washing up on the beach.
*21:31.720- 21:35.120* :  Now hundreds of people are working to try and save the local environment.
*21:39.180- 21:41.620* :  Can you set the stage a little bit so people understand what happened?
*21:42.360- 21:48.640* :  In 1969 14 black student athletes were kicked off their university's American football team
*21:48.640- 21:54.900* :  for planning a show of support against racism. We were really protesting our treatment on the field.

*23:20.560- 23:24.560* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. To Indonesia now,
*23:24.940- 23:29.200* :  where the final rallies have been held ahead of the presidential elections on Wednesday,
*23:29.940- 23:35.260* :  more than 200 million Indonesians can vote in an election, which will choose a successor to the
*23:35.260- 23:40.080* :  popular outgoing president, Widoko. He's not allowed to serve more than two terms.
*23:40.920- 23:45.740* :  As Jonathan Head reports from Jakarta, there are concerns about the outcome of this election,
*23:45.740- 23:50.540* :  as the favorite to win is a former general who's carried out human rights abuse.
*23:51.160- 23:53.740* :  And his running mate is the current president's son.
*23:59.180- 24:01.780* :  Away from the noise and color of the political rallies,
*24:01.780- 24:06.020* :  a small protest gathers in front of the presidential palace in Jakarta.
*24:08.960- 24:13.960* :  These are the families of those who died or disappeared in the chaotic last months of the
*24:13.960- 24:23.440* :  authoritarian Sahata regime. They've been coming here every Thursday for 17 years, demanding answers.
*24:24.560- 24:29.840* :  Among them is Pian, father of Uchok, a student who vanished in May 1998.
*24:34.960- 24:39.200* :  We come here every week to make sure that human rights violators are not elected,
*24:39.200- 24:43.680* :  he taught me. And he showed me the words printed on the back of his t-shirt,
*24:44.420- 24:48.280* :  bring back the disappeared, don't let him rule the country.
*24:55.020- 24:57.020* :  By him, he means this man.
*24:58.520- 25:03.340* :  Preboo Subianto is the front runner in this election, his third attempt at the presidency.
*25:04.280- 25:09.100* :  To get here, he's needed an extraordinary transformation of his public image.
*25:12.580- 25:14.520* :  This was Jakarta in May 1998.
*25:15.260- 25:17.680* :  I was there.
*25:20.740- 25:23.920* :  An orgy of looting and burning swept across the city
*25:24.380- 25:27.440* :  was the 32-year rule of President Sahato collapsed.
*25:28.600- 25:32.040* :  Blame for the violence and for the kidnapping of political activists
*25:32.560- 25:37.280* :  was pinned on his son-in-law, Preboo, then a fast-rising star in the military.
*25:37.280- 25:40.820* :  He was dismissed from the army and went into exile.
*25:44.420- 25:48.440* :  Now, with a slick social media campaign, he's portrayed as a cuddly,
*25:48.440- 25:53.800* :  a vincular figure, a moderate who will continue the popular legacy of President Jakoe.
*25:54.460- 25:59.880* :  It's been very successful, especially with younger Indonesians who know little of Preboo's past.
*26:03.100- 26:06.340* :  Well, all the candidates have their sins since student Leonardis.
*26:06.700- 26:10.840* :  Maybe he didn't carry out those kidnappings. Maybe he was just following orders.
*26:10.940- 26:15.600* :  But it's President Jakoe's full endorsement of the former military hardman,
*26:15.600- 26:20.420* :  which has dismayed so many Indonesians. Through a controversial court ruling,
*26:20.420- 26:24.900* :  the president has got his son Gibran on the ticket as Preboo's running mate,
*26:24.900- 26:28.280* :  even though he's below the constitutional age threshold.
*26:28.700- 26:33.060* :  You know, you cannot allow democracy to be on autopilot. It needs to be constantly
*26:33.060- 26:34.380* :  re-invigorated.
*26:34.760- 26:38.920* :  Dewey Fortuna Anwar has been an advisor to presidents and vice presidents.
*26:39.720- 26:43.000* :  She worries about this nepotistic step by Jakoe.
*26:43.380- 26:46.040* :  A lot of democracy activists say, you know,
*26:46.040- 26:50.220* :  well, Jakoe is not that concerned about democracy. He's a businessman, you know.
*26:50.540- 26:54.260* :  So he's still forgiven in a way, even though it costs Indonesians democracy,
*26:54.260- 26:56.660* :  but it is a collective mistake for us.
*26:57.000- 27:00.100* :  But by making it personal, Jakoe has, in fact,
*27:00.140- 27:02.260* :  tarnishes his own image, his own reputation.
*27:05.560- 27:08.840* :  25 years after the first post-Saharto election,
*27:09.280- 27:14.040* :  Indonesians appear to have lost none of their enthusiasm for their young democracy.
*27:15.100- 27:18.780* :  Compared to many others in the region, it is still in rude health.
*27:19.700- 27:25.140* :  But few would disagree that it's certainly less free and less accountable than it used to be.
*27:25.940- 27:30.780* :  And that a figure like Proboa Subiento makes a very unlikely savior.
*27:34.480- 27:38.840* :  Jonathan Head A growing environmental disaster could be unfolding
*27:38.840- 27:44.760* :  off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. Hundreds of volunteers and emergency workers are trying
*27:44.760- 27:51.700* :  to clean up a massive oil spill after a ship overturned a few days ago after hitting a coral reef.
*27:52.520- 27:57.820* :  The government says at least 15 kilometers of coastline on the Atlantic coast have been affected.
*27:58.540- 28:02.360* :  I heard more from my Latin America regional editor, Linanda Rocher.
*28:02.800- 28:07.340* :  Well, it happened on Wednesday, this mysterious vessel, this mysterious ship,
*28:07.800- 28:12.540* :  just hits a big coral reef off the coast of Tobago,
*28:12.800- 28:15.940* :  north southwest and the southwest inside of the islands.
*28:16.000- 28:21.160* :  The crew escaped. They are trying to identify who are the owners of this ship,
*28:21.160- 28:24.000* :  called the Gulf Stream. They already know the name of the ship.
*28:24.320- 28:30.800* :  But what happens then you have huge amounts of oil washing up on the beach and nearby areas.
*28:31.240- 28:35.860* :  So I've seen pictures online, you see footage and you have the government there saying that
*28:35.860- 28:41.340* :  15 kilometers of coastline in the area of Tobago has been affected.
*28:41.460- 28:45.820* :  They are trying to do what they can to to contain because with oil spills,
*28:45.820- 28:49.460* :  the main thing is to try to contain as quickly as possible.
*28:49.620- 28:52.180* :  Is there any history of oil spills in this area?
*28:52.440- 28:57.420* :  From what I heard, I haven't heard about any recent oil spills there.
*28:57.680- 29:02.080* :  But from what I heard, it's a busy area because Trinidad and Tobago has oil.
*29:02.500- 29:07.520* :  Now Guyana has oil and if you look on the map, Trinidad and Tobago is just next to Venezuela
*29:07.580- 29:10.540* :  and it's a busy route for oil tankers.
*29:10.940- 29:15.020* :  So from the comments I read, people saying we have to be careful,
*29:15.020- 29:19.760* :  this sort of things can happen here all the time. It's completely uncontrolled.
*29:20.180- 29:21.500* :  It's an accident that can happen.
*29:21.500- 29:25.940* :  But the damage for the island can be huge.
*29:26.520- 29:32.200* :  I mean they deployed volunteers, they're trying to establish this perimeter where they put devices
*29:32.200- 29:35.360* :  to contain it and basically to clean up the oil.
*29:35.920- 29:39.940* :  But it comes at a very bad time for the island which is just before carnival.
*29:40.100- 29:41.920* :  And how significant is the carnival there?
*29:42.120- 29:44.520* :  Well Trinidad and Tobago has a famous carnival.
*29:44.520- 29:48.480* :  It's one of the best carnivals or the most popular in the Caribbean.
*29:49.100- 29:52.720* :  And officially at the carnival there is a Monday on Tuesday.
*29:52.720- 29:55.880* :  So the weekend is when you have all the tourists arriving.
*29:55.880- 29:59.120* :  You have resorts around the area that where people travel.
*29:59.120- 30:03.240* :  You're not only for the carnival but because of the holiday season.
*30:03.240- 30:08.020* :  What the hotel management group there is saying people who represent the hotels
*30:08.400- 30:11.420* :  is that they're very concerned and many people might be put off.
*30:11.440- 30:15.580* :  They had a cruise ship arriving there and everyone was warned.
*30:15.580- 30:16.760* :  3,000 tourists.
*30:17.320- 30:19.980* :  They were warned to be careful where they went
*30:21.340- 30:22.560* :  because there had been an oil spill.
*30:22.560- 30:24.720* :  So it creates a very bad image for the island.
*30:25.180- 30:30.860* :  And more immediately many people might cancel their plans to go to the island.
*30:30.860- 30:34.020* :  There was a local carnival facility that was canceled.
*30:34.520- 30:40.300* :  And people are very concerned because this is a lifeline for many people who work on the industry
*30:40.300- 30:45.560* :  for tourist guides, for taxi drivers, for the small hotels and for the big resorts.
*30:46.340- 30:47.340* :  Leonardo Rossia.
*30:48.280- 30:52.620* :  Now here's an item for those who are fortunate enough to enjoy gourmet cooking.
*30:53.300- 30:56.280* :  The best chefs in the world generally consider it an honour
*30:56.680- 30:59.600* :  for their restaurants to be listed in the Michelin guide.
*31:00.260- 31:04.460* :  This is published by the French tyre company Michelin and it's updated each year
*31:04.920- 31:07.720* :  to list what it regards as the finest restaurants.
*31:08.500- 31:12.880* :  The very best get rated with three stars but just getting one star
*31:12.880- 31:17.600* :  is seen as a major achievement and a mark of global recognition.
*31:17.640- 31:24.120* :  Adi Okbaqadi is the first black woman in the UK to be awarded a Michelin star
*31:24.660- 31:26.260* :  and only the second in the world.
*31:26.940- 31:30.320* :  She's the Nigerian-born founder and head chef at Chizuru,
*31:30.760- 31:34.260* :  a restaurant which specialises in West African cooking in London.
*31:34.920- 31:39.760* :  Adi Okbaqadi gave us her thoughts on why the restaurant has achieved such recognition.
*31:48.940- 31:52.500* :  I think people could connect to the fact that we're showing our heritage
*31:52.500- 31:58.720* :  and people could see themselves on the table and it didn't feel or look like something that was
*31:58.720- 32:04.180* :  inaccessible. So, case in points, there is this dish that we had on
*32:04.400- 32:06.500* :  we're still having it on but it's in a different form.
*32:07.020- 32:12.080* :  Carl Sennasser and Sennasser is very popular around Northern Nigeria
*32:12.080- 32:16.220* :  and across parts of Northern West Africa and I've forgotten what she called
*32:16.220- 32:20.100* :  she must be Indian South Indian and she came in and she ate it.
*32:20.100- 32:23.600* :  She said, she said, I eat it every morning when I was growing up.
*32:24.020- 32:27.540* :  So, it's that connection with people on the dining table I think
*32:27.540- 32:30.980* :  was what what people found and what people loved.
*32:35.220- 32:38.640* :  Oh no, I mean, I stand the defender like yourself for you.
*32:39.900- 32:43.040* :  Most people that come here haven't had the food before
*32:43.520- 32:47.020* :  but people could see bits that remind them of themselves
*32:47.020- 32:51.060* :  because I think before West African food has been seen as this
*32:51.420- 32:58.080* :  fairly scary inaccessible thing but when people come they see that part of it
*32:58.280- 33:01.380* :  tell their friends and for us mostly it has been worth of mouth.
*33:01.940- 33:06.380* :  It's been somebody coming in eating like him it recommending it to their friends
*33:06.560- 33:09.560* :  I'm going, oh you should go there because they have this version
*33:09.560- 33:12.280* :  this West African version of this thing that we have.
*33:19.800- 33:24.180* :  Well, with this now thank God, they'll start looking into the continent itself
*33:24.180- 33:28.140* :  their loads of young books doing fantastic things
*33:28.700- 33:33.020* :  and I don't know I just think maybe because when it comes to say
*33:33.020- 33:37.420* :  Chinese, Japanese, Korean food people visit they go on holidays
*33:38.140- 33:41.160* :  and come back and try and recreate those things that they have
*33:41.660- 33:46.000* :  I think with more people going on holidays there's a lot of people now going to Ghana
*33:46.000- 33:50.540* :  whatever eating food and coming back and thinking, oh I want to try this.
*33:56.480- 34:01.760* :  As much as we want people to have it, for me it is also about the history
*34:01.760- 34:06.020* :  so that it's not diluted so much that it loses itself
*34:06.340- 34:09.980* :  because sometimes some of this brand is just becomes a thing of profit or whatever
*34:10.020- 34:13.420* :  I think people come thinking it's going to be fine dining and we're not
*34:13.460- 34:19.400* :  what we're doing in tissue basically is just sharing food of my heritage
*34:20.020- 34:25.040* :  and I'm cooking it the same way my grandma will cook it it's just the continuation of that
*34:33.540- 34:39.820* :  Ariokai Baccada finally to football and the hoax cata have won the Asian Cup
*34:40.500- 34:44.180* :  the raiding champions beat the underdogs Jordan by three goals to one
*34:44.860- 34:48.120* :  and they defended that title with a remarkable hat trigger penalties
*34:48.740- 34:52.220* :  by Akram Afeif who became the tournament's top scorer
*34:52.800- 34:55.660* :  the BBC's puria jaffray watched the game in Doha
*34:56.300- 34:59.980* :  and told me the tournament will be remembered for a number of shock results
*35:00.060- 35:04.180* :  everybody thought this is going to be a Japan South Korea final if not
*35:04.180- 35:09.160* :  maybe other ones like Iran, Saudi or Australia can make it to the final
*35:09.160- 35:14.280* :  but in the end we have two Arab teams from this region make it to the final
*35:14.640- 35:19.840* :  the stadium was full and this is something I've been coming here for a long time
*35:19.840- 35:23.460* :  this is this is something which doesn't happen here very often
*35:23.880- 35:28.940* :  I've seen Qatar games which happened in very smaller stadiums with
*35:28.940- 35:32.560* :  10,000 12,000 capacity and this time it was full
*35:32.840- 35:37.380* :  and of course as you say it's just a year on from the World Cup in Qatar
