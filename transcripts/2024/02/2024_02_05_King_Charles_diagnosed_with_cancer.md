*00:00.120- 00:03.820* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.120- 00:09.080* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*00:09.080- 00:11.920* :  the 6th of February, these are our main stories.
*00:12.520- 00:15.440* :  Britain's King Charles has been diagnosed with cancer.
*00:15.440- 00:18.460* :  The news has made public in a statement from Buckingham Palace.
*00:18.860- 00:22.540* :  It is unprecedented, and I think we have to appeal to the palace
*00:22.680- 00:24.560* :  for having come out with something like that.
*00:24.880- 00:29.280* :  The palace has not said what type of cancer the king has been diagnosed with,
*00:29.760- 00:31.480* :  but it is not prostate cancer.
*00:31.700- 00:33.200* :  World wishes have been flooding in.
*00:33.640- 00:38.080* :  I know the whole house will wish to join me in expressing our sympathies,
*00:38.340- 00:41.580* :  and our very best wishes for the successful treatment
*00:41.580- 00:44.380* :  and the speed recovery following tonight's news.
*00:44.380- 00:47.580* :  The 75-year-old king will undergo a course of treatment
*00:47.580- 00:50.360* :  and has been advised to postpone public duties,
*00:50.360- 00:53.460* :  but will undertake state duties and paperwork.
*00:56.680- 01:00.580* :  Also in this podcast, the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*01:00.580- 01:03.880* :  is in Saudi Arabia for talks on a truce in Gaza,
*01:04.340- 01:07.840* :  and an independent body says the social media giant meta
*01:07.840- 01:11.560* :  should label fake posts rather than taking them down.
*01:15.360- 01:19.380* :  Buckingham Palace has announced King Charles has been diagnosed with cancer
*01:19.380- 01:23.180* :  and will step back from public engagements while he receives treatment.
*01:23.180- 01:28.120* :  In a statement, the palace said King Charles remained wholly positive about his treatment,
*01:28.580- 01:29.720* :  which began on Monday.
*01:30.180- 01:33.080* :  The speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle,
*01:33.320- 01:35.420* :  made a short statement wishing the king well.
*01:35.740- 01:40.500* :  I know the whole house will wish to join me in expressing our sympathies
*01:40.740- 01:44.360* :  with his majesty the king following the news announcement this evening.
*01:44.800- 01:48.680* :  Our thoughts were of course with his majesty and his family,
*01:49.420- 01:53.120* :  and with all wish to send him our very best wishes,
*01:53.680- 01:57.940* :  for the successful treatment and a speed recovery following tonight's news.
*01:58.460- 02:00.800* :  And this was the reaction of people in London.
*02:01.740- 02:04.960* :  I think it's very sad to come in a year after the coronation.
*02:05.140- 02:08.920* :  I think my thoughts are with him, with the family and that he gets well soon.
*02:09.760- 02:13.560* :  Having been a person in the public eye for so long,
*02:13.860- 02:16.700* :  I'm sure he is aware of how much that will connect
*02:16.740- 02:19.300* :  into other people, other families who goes through that.
*02:19.600- 02:22.040* :  I'm sure he'll fight it, like anyone else would,
*02:22.220- 02:24.160* :  but it's, yeah, it's a horrible shock.
*02:24.960- 02:28.440* :  The surprise announcement came after the king was discharged from hospital
*02:28.440- 02:31.480* :  after surgery for an enlarged prostate last month.
*02:31.980- 02:36.600* :  Our royal correspondent Sean Cochlan told me more about the reaction to the news.
*02:37.560- 02:39.900* :  Well, as you say, it was something of a surprise, what it was.
*02:40.100- 02:41.520* :  We do know the treatment's already begun,
*02:41.520- 02:46.820* :  and he's an outpatient, and presumably he will be receiving regular treatment
*02:46.820- 02:48.280* :  in the days and months ahead.
*02:48.880- 02:51.320* :  As you mentioned, it's sufficient that he'll have to step back
*02:52.060- 02:53.560* :  from public facing engagements.
*02:53.560- 02:56.620* :  He won't be out and about, but he's not stepping down as head of state.
*02:56.620- 02:58.620* :  He's going to carry on with the paperwork,
*02:58.700- 03:01.540* :  doing his red boxes and carrying on with private meetings.
*03:01.940- 03:04.220* :  And so in that sense, it really business is usual,
*03:04.220- 03:07.380* :  but clearly his main preoccupation will be getting better, I think,
*03:07.380- 03:08.520* :  in the days and weeks ahead.
*03:09.000- 03:10.720* :  And we know that he's spoken to his family,
*03:11.200- 03:13.760* :  and we know that Prince Harry, who now lives in California,
*03:13.760- 03:16.740* :  will be coming back to Britain to see him in the days ahead.
*03:17.260- 03:19.820* :  And it is all very sudden, because he was at that church
*03:19.820- 03:24.780* :  in Norfolk near his country estate in Sandringham on Sunday.
*03:25.340- 03:26.700* :  That's right, and looking very sprightly,
*03:26.700- 03:29.300* :  waving to crowds and appearing to be on the mend.
*03:29.460- 03:32.320* :  And all the mood music, as it were, was quite positive.
*03:32.660- 03:33.340* :  He sounds optimistic.
*03:33.340- 03:35.240* :  He's talking about wanting to get back to work again
*03:35.240- 03:37.720* :  and to embrace whatever the treatment involved.
*03:38.500- 03:39.900* :  But obviously, there's some serious concern,
*03:40.120- 03:41.400* :  and we won't see him again,
*03:41.760- 03:44.800* :  carrying out public duties for some unspecified amount of time.
*03:45.600- 03:47.780* :  I'm seeing coming in on the wires,
*03:47.780- 03:50.820* :  the US State Department, spokesman Vedent Patel,
*03:51.260- 03:54.000* :  described it as an incredibly sad piece of news,
*03:54.000- 03:56.400* :  and says, I'm very sorry for the king and his family.
*03:56.400- 03:57.740* :  He tells a briefing of reporters
*03:58.320- 04:00.800* :  that the Biden and registration's thoughts are with the king
*04:01.520- 04:03.000* :  and the royal family.
*04:03.780- 04:06.840* :  This is notable, because the king really does still have
*04:06.840- 04:10.280* :  a very important place in British public life, doesn't he?
*04:10.780- 04:11.880* :  Well, he does, and also internationally,
*04:11.880- 04:15.020* :  I think that we've seen his role in environmental matters.
*04:15.020- 04:16.740* :  It's been very high profile.
*04:16.740- 04:18.780* :  He gave the keynote address at the most recent
*04:19.200- 04:20.200* :  COP summit in Dubai,
*04:20.840- 04:23.560* :  and the fact has been this cascade of concern
*04:24.200- 04:26.840* :  from people within Breton and overseas shows
*04:26.840- 04:29.140* :  that his status and how much there are concerns.
*04:29.140- 04:32.360* :  It might be wrong to start being too gloomy about this.
*04:32.440- 04:33.920* :  You know, this is so far something
*04:33.920- 04:35.880* :  which we would like to think has been caught
*04:35.880- 04:37.660* :  in the early stages and treatments beginning.
*04:38.220- 04:39.780* :  But it does show that the level of concern
*04:39.780- 04:42.720* :  by that sort of contribution from Rishi Sunak
*04:42.720- 04:44.100* :  and from Keir Starmer and Breton,
*04:44.540- 04:47.620* :  senior politicians who wanted to share their own concerns as well.
*04:48.260- 04:49.440* :  We don't know exactly what it is,
*04:49.440- 04:50.540* :  and we're seeing with that will determine
*04:51.100- 04:52.080* :  the path that comes ahead,
*04:52.600- 04:54.880* :  where it lays, and it's prognosis,
*04:55.140- 04:55.840* :  hasn't been revealed,
*04:56.060- 04:57.520* :  and I think won't necessarily be revealed
*04:57.520- 04:59.040* :  in setting the near future.
*04:59.540- 05:02.920* :  Sean Cochlan, our health editor Hugh Pym,
*05:02.920- 05:04.400* :  told me more about the diagnosis
*05:04.740- 05:06.180* :  and the king's treatment options.
*05:06.980- 05:09.380* :  He had this treatment for a benign prostate
*05:09.380- 05:13.400* :  enlargement 10 days or so ago and left hospital,
*05:13.400- 05:14.720* :  and it was stressed at the time
*05:14.720- 05:17.960* :  that that was not prostate cancer, that it was benign.
*05:17.960- 05:19.620* :  But what appears to have happened
*05:19.620- 05:22.160* :  is that in the course of having that treatment,
*05:22.220- 05:26.340* :  another condition was identified, tests were carried out,
*05:26.920- 05:29.100* :  and then this diagnosis of another cancer,
*05:29.100- 05:31.480* :  but we don't know what sort of cancer.
*05:32.000- 05:34.580* :  Now, it's probably fortuitous for the king
*05:34.580- 05:37.760* :  that this was diagnosed when they were already carrying out
*05:37.760- 05:38.520* :  another procedure.
*05:38.520- 05:40.140* :  It might have gone unnoticed.
*05:40.220- 05:42.600* :  Some cancers have very, very few symptoms,
*05:42.600- 05:45.300* :  but we don't know what stage it's at.
*05:45.380- 05:47.920* :  We know that he's had his first bout of treatment
*05:47.920- 05:49.020* :  as an outpatient,
*05:49.640- 05:51.640* :  and in the words of a palace spokesperson,
*05:51.700- 05:53.640* :  he remains at home in London,
*05:53.960- 05:56.400* :  so we assume that he'll go in for further treatment.
*05:57.240- 05:59.880* :  And the palace has said that the king
*05:59.880- 06:02.000* :  elected to make his diagnosis public
*06:02.480- 06:03.820* :  once the treatment had begun,
*06:04.520- 06:07.020* :  because he wanted to get the news out there.
*06:07.480- 06:08.460* :  He, as Prince of Wales,
*06:08.460- 06:11.160* :  was a patron by the number of cancer-related charities,
*06:11.160- 06:12.320* :  and in this capacity,
*06:12.960- 06:14.560* :  the king had often spoken publicly
*06:14.560- 06:16.080* :  in support of cancer patients,
*06:16.160- 06:17.080* :  and their loved ones,
*06:17.560- 06:18.560* :  and NHS staff,
*06:18.560- 06:20.040* :  and others who care for them.
*06:20.480- 06:22.980* :  So it's in keeping with getting the news out there
*06:23.340- 06:24.340* :  as quickly as possible.
*06:24.560- 06:26.620* :  That was the wishes of the king were told.
*06:26.620- 06:28.020* :  Maybe in previous decades,
*06:28.020- 06:31.080* :  this sort of thing wouldn't have been given so much publicity.
*06:31.760- 06:34.220* :  And interestingly, when it was made clear
*06:34.220- 06:35.560* :  that he'd had this treatment
*06:35.560- 06:37.640* :  for a benign prostate enlargement,
*06:38.220- 06:40.120* :  there were a lot of calls to helplines,
*06:40.440- 06:41.740* :  run by the National Health Service,
*06:42.080- 06:43.560* :  going on to NHS websites.
*06:44.120- 06:45.600* :  It raised a lot of awareness.
*06:45.600- 06:48.500* :  It was made clear that the king was encouraged,
*06:49.040- 06:50.460* :  by the way that his diagnosis
*06:51.160- 06:53.280* :  had encouraged others to come forward
*06:53.280- 06:54.840* :  and check their own conditions.
*06:55.820- 06:57.400* :  Kima Therapy is a horrible treatment,
*06:57.400- 06:58.320* :  whatever aids you are,
*06:58.320- 06:59.260* :  but at the age of 75,
*06:59.260- 07:00.600* :  that's quite a thing, isn't it?
*07:00.900- 07:02.400* :  Yes, Kima Therapy seems likely.
*07:02.400- 07:03.420* :  It's not been confirmed,
*07:03.420- 07:05.600* :  then actually Buckingham Palace said they wouldn't comment
*07:05.720- 07:08.160* :  on his ongoing treatment or what the cancer was.
*07:08.940- 07:11.300* :  But Kima Therapy or Radio Therapy
*07:11.340- 07:13.820* :  are very often first line treatments
*07:13.820- 07:16.540* :  for recently diagnosed cancer patients,
*07:16.540- 07:19.640* :  for patients who are diagnosed and have chemotherapy.
*07:19.640- 07:21.480* :  It's quite an intense form of treatment
*07:21.480- 07:24.200* :  and it can leave the patient pretty debilitated
*07:24.500- 07:25.380* :  for a week or so.
*07:25.980- 07:28.260* :  And then maybe go back to their ordinary routines
*07:28.260- 07:31.700* :  and then come back again the following month for further chemo.
*07:31.820- 07:34.900* :  But generally it takes time for a consultant,
*07:35.100- 07:36.260* :  for a senior doctor,
*07:36.460- 07:38.900* :  to be clear that the cancer has gone.
*07:38.900- 07:42.300* :  So it'll be ongoing checks and scans, certainly.
*07:42.780- 07:45.140* :  Cancer risk does go up with age.
*07:45.620- 07:46.640* :  From the age of 75,
*07:46.640- 07:49.000* :  some UK statistics show that a third
*07:49.000- 07:50.800* :  of new cancers diagnosed every year
*07:51.160- 07:53.340* :  are in those 75 or over.
*07:53.600- 07:55.500* :  So the king, given his age,
*07:55.500- 07:56.540* :  would have been a bit more vulnerable,
*07:56.540- 07:58.040* :  but he's been very fit and well
*07:58.520- 07:59.940* :  for his life, very active.
*08:00.600- 08:03.620* :  And he, we are told, is wholly positive about his treatment.
*08:04.500- 08:06.300* :  Our health editor, Hugh Pym.
*08:07.100- 08:09.380* :  Rob Watson is our political correspondent.
*08:09.400- 08:11.160* :  He told me more about the news
*08:11.160- 08:13.400* :  that Prince Harry will be returning to Britain
*08:13.400- 08:15.240* :  to be reunited with his father.
*08:15.560- 08:18.640* :  We are hearing that Prince Harry has not only spoken
*08:18.960- 08:20.640* :  to his father, King Charles,
*08:20.640- 08:22.380* :  called him to tell him what was up,
*08:22.740- 08:25.520* :  but that he will be coming back to the UK in the coming days.
*08:25.740- 08:27.000* :  And it's not a surprise
*08:27.160- 08:28.500* :  that you don't have to be one of those people
*08:28.540- 08:30.540* :  that follows all the kind of gossip columns
*08:31.100- 08:32.520* :  about the royal family to know
*08:32.520- 08:34.480* :  that they have had a very difficult relationship.
*08:35.020- 08:35.940* :  The last couple of years,
*08:35.940- 08:38.740* :  it's why Prince Harry is living in the United States.
*08:38.740- 08:40.280* :  But again, in a lot of families,
*08:40.280- 08:42.400* :  a lot of people listening will be familiar with this
*08:42.400- 08:43.760* :  that when illness strikes,
*08:43.760- 08:45.640* :  families do tend to rally around.
*08:45.640- 08:47.460* :  And that seems to be what's happening in this case.
*08:47.960- 08:50.600* :  I understand the king telephoned
*08:50.860- 08:52.740* :  all his family members personally
*08:53.000- 08:54.700* :  to give them this diagnosis.
*08:55.360- 08:57.340* :  Yes, we don't have the exact timing on that,
*08:57.380- 08:59.220* :  but they certainly heard about it before.
*08:59.220- 09:01.720* :  The very brief four paragraph statement
*09:01.720- 09:03.360* :  released by Buckingham Palace.
*09:03.900- 09:05.380* :  I think that's not at all surprising
*09:05.460- 09:07.640* :  that he wanted to tell the closest members
*09:07.640- 09:10.900* :  of his family, the royal family in person,
*09:10.900- 09:13.040* :  exactly what it was that he was facing.
*09:13.580- 09:15.200* :  And I'm looking also on the wires.
*09:15.260- 09:18.000* :  We're getting goodwill messages coming in
*09:18.420- 09:19.660* :  from all over the world.
*09:19.660- 09:22.360* :  President Biden says he's concerned about the king,
*09:22.960- 09:24.140* :  asked if he had a message for the king.
*09:24.140- 09:26.120* :  Biden said, yes, I'm concerned about him.
*09:26.120- 09:27.460* :  I just heard this diagnosis.
*09:27.460- 09:29.580* :  Hopefully I'll be talking to him soon.
*09:29.580- 09:31.480* :  And the former US president,
*09:32.160- 09:33.980* :  Donald Trump, writing on social media,
*09:33.980- 09:37.160* :  he is a wonderful man who I got to know well during my presidency.
*09:37.820- 09:41.400* :  We all pray that he has a fast and a full recovery.
*09:41.600- 09:44.180* :  He does have a lot of goodwill coming in.
*09:44.860- 09:45.660* :  He does indeed.
*09:45.660- 09:49.660* :  And while he's had his ups and downs in terms of his popularity
*09:49.660- 09:50.900* :  with the British public,
*09:50.900- 09:53.700* :  certainly the politicians that I know
*09:53.700- 09:56.320* :  who've dealt with them and politicians around the world
*09:56.320- 09:58.280* :  heads of state, he is popular.
*09:58.500- 10:00.000* :  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
*10:00.000- 10:03.780* :  Those who've worked with him closely say he is immensely charming
*10:03.780- 10:06.020* :  that he cares very much about those issues
*10:06.020- 10:08.400* :  that we all know that he's been pressing,
*10:08.400- 10:10.380* :  particularly concerned for the environment
*10:10.380- 10:12.820* :  way ahead of everybody else who was doing it.
*10:12.820- 10:14.840* :  So he's always been a favorite
*10:14.840- 10:17.260* :  on the international diplomatic circuit.
*10:17.780- 10:20.840* :  And I think interesting is what's happened here in the UK
*10:20.840- 10:22.980* :  because I mentioned that his relationship
*10:23.480- 10:25.440* :  with the British people have been a bit up and down.
*10:25.480- 10:27.300* :  I mean, anybody old enough to remember
*10:27.300- 10:30.360* :  the mid-1990s would know that as his marriage
*10:30.360- 10:32.840* :  to Princess Diana was falling to pieces,
*10:33.380- 10:35.340* :  he became very unpopular indeed.
*10:35.480- 10:36.860* :  And an awful lot of British people,
*10:36.860- 10:38.000* :  particularly younger people,
*10:38.500- 10:39.700* :  with people taking sides.
*10:39.700- 10:42.900* :  A lot of people tended to side with Diana's version of events.
*10:42.900- 10:46.060* :  But it's really interesting if you look at opinion polling
*10:46.060- 10:48.180* :  over the last 10, 20 years.
*10:48.480- 10:50.200* :  And particularly if you look back at polling
*10:50.200- 10:51.360* :  since he became king,
*10:51.360- 10:54.260* :  I looked at one from a company called YuGov, Alex.
*10:54.260- 10:57.240* :  He's now got a favorability rating of 60%
*10:58.060- 10:58.960* :  at the end of last year.
*10:59.020- 11:00.740* :  I think most politicians would die
*11:00.740- 11:04.280* :  to have a favorability rating of 60%.
*11:04.440- 11:05.820* :  And this diagnosis, Robert,
*11:05.820- 11:07.780* :  is just proof really, isn't it,
*11:07.780- 11:09.460* :  that cancer can strike anyone?
*11:09.860- 11:10.960* :  Yes, absolutely.
*11:10.960- 11:13.000* :  And again, I draw your attention.
*11:13.000- 11:15.140* :  I mentioned that the statement from Buckingham Palace
*11:15.140- 11:17.040* :  was very short, just four paragraphs.
*11:17.620- 11:19.320* :  I may as well just read the last one
*11:19.320- 11:20.880* :  because it goes to your question.
*11:21.340- 11:24.360* :  And it says his majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis
*11:25.020- 11:26.260* :  to prevent speculation
*11:26.420- 11:29.480* :  and in the hope it may assist public understanding
*11:29.480- 11:31.120* :  for all those around the world
*11:31.160- 11:32.900* :  who are affected by cancer.
*11:32.900- 11:35.120* :  So clearly, King Charles Buckingham Palace
*11:35.120- 11:36.540* :  the role family are thinking, right,
*11:36.940- 11:38.820* :  we've got a specific issue to deal with,
*11:38.860- 11:41.720* :  which is how do we deal with King Charles having cancer.
*11:41.720- 11:43.100* :  But while we're about it,
*11:43.240- 11:45.720* :  let's try and do some sort of public service work here,
*11:45.720- 11:48.040* :  not just in the UK in terms of
*11:48.200- 11:50.580* :  showing sympathy, showing awareness of cancer,
*11:50.580- 11:52.100* :  but actually beyond these shores
*11:52.140- 11:53.500* :  and saying, right, everybody needs
*11:53.500- 11:55.120* :  to kind of check themselves over.
*11:55.940- 11:56.460* :  Rob Watson.
*11:57.900- 11:58.920* :  Now to some other news,
*11:59.200- 12:00.480* :  Israel's defense minister,
*12:00.480- 12:03.180* :  Yoav Galant has said his country's forces
*12:03.180- 12:04.820* :  will reach Hamas militants
*12:04.820- 12:07.400* :  in what he called their last hold out in Gaza,
*12:07.920- 12:09.760* :  the city of Raffa in the South.
*12:10.220- 12:11.880* :  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
*12:11.880- 12:13.260* :  have taken refuge there.
*12:13.460- 12:14.780* :  Mr. Galant was speaking
*12:14.780- 12:16.680* :  as the US Secretary of State,
*12:16.680- 12:19.060* :  Anthony Blinken, began his fifth visit
*12:19.080- 12:21.060* :  to the Middle East since the war in Gaza.
*12:21.060- 12:21.480* :  He began.
*12:22.040- 12:24.140* :  He sold talks with the Saudi Crown Prince,
*12:24.140- 12:26.500* :  Mohammed bin Selman, in Rehat,
*12:26.900- 12:28.480* :  correspondent in Jerusalem,
*12:28.480- 12:30.660* :  Barbara Plattasha, has this update.
*12:31.340- 12:33.400* :  Mr. Blinken's immediate concern
*12:33.400- 12:36.360* :  is trying to get a truce in Gaza
*12:36.720- 12:37.820* :  to release hostages
*12:38.140- 12:39.840* :  and allow humanitarian aid in,
*12:40.400- 12:43.160* :  but he also has an interest in looking
*12:43.160- 12:44.480* :  at what happens in the region
*12:44.860- 12:45.280* :  after the war,
*12:45.280- 12:46.900* :  what happens in Gaza after the war.
*12:47.380- 12:50.320* :  The United States has returned to the idea
*12:50.320- 12:52.020* :  of a two-state solution,
*12:52.020- 12:54.120* :  a Palestinian state alongside Israel
*12:54.120- 12:57.040* :  as a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
*12:57.040- 12:59.220* :  and it sees Saudi Arabia as key to that
*12:59.220- 13:02.040* :  because they want to wrap it into a deal
*13:02.040- 13:05.960* :  between Saudi Arabia and Israel's normalization deal.
*13:06.000- 13:08.280* :  The Israelis, or at least the Israeli Prime Minister,
*13:08.280- 13:09.860* :  has voiced quite strong opposition
*13:09.980- 13:11.540* :  to the idea of a two-state solution.
*13:11.540- 13:13.480* :  So the approach of the Americans
*13:13.480- 13:16.180* :  is to try to use Israel's interest
*13:16.380- 13:18.100* :  in relations with Saudi Arabia
*13:18.100- 13:20.120* :  to move it in that direction.
*13:20.120- 13:22.860* :  So he's looking at post-war plans
*13:22.860- 13:24.580* :  while the war is still going on.
*13:25.060- 13:26.700* :  The most immediate efforts for a truce
*13:26.740- 13:28.080* :  haven't been achieved yet,
*13:28.080- 13:30.380* :  but these talks with Saudi Arabia
*13:30.720- 13:32.300* :  have been part of the overall picture.
*13:33.120- 13:34.980* :  The deal, the one that's active,
*13:34.980- 13:38.340* :  is one for stopping the hostilities
*13:38.680- 13:40.440* :  long enough to release the hostages
*13:40.440- 13:42.880* :  and to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.
*13:42.880- 13:44.220* :  And so right now,
*13:44.220- 13:46.680* :  what we are doing is waiting for Hamas
*13:46.680- 13:48.500* :  to come back with its response
*13:48.560- 13:51.460* :  to basically a framework that was put forward
*13:52.040- 13:54.460* :  by the top intelligence officials
*13:54.460- 13:57.780* :  in the U.S., Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.
*13:57.780- 14:00.920* :  They're proposing a sort of agreement in phases
*14:01.440- 14:02.720* :  during which in each phase
*14:02.880- 14:04.840* :  the Hamas would release Israeli hostages
*14:04.840- 14:06.500* :  is what would release Palestinian prisoners
*14:07.160- 14:08.500* :  and then move on to another phase.
*14:09.040- 14:10.940* :  But the key part of it is that
*14:10.940- 14:13.460* :  it does not commit Israel to ending the war
*14:13.460- 14:15.160* :  whereas Hamas says it wants
*14:15.700- 14:17.400* :  any sort of temporary truce
*14:17.440- 14:19.060* :  to lead to a permanent ceasefire.
*14:19.600- 14:21.020* :  And that's one of the key sticking points.
*14:21.020- 14:22.300* :  So they're waiting to see
*14:22.300- 14:24.280* :  whether Hamas is willing in any way
*14:24.280- 14:25.580* :  to build on this framework
*14:26.000- 14:27.760* :  to get to this truce.
*14:28.420- 14:29.300* :  Barbara Plattasha.
*14:30.420- 14:32.040* :  A team of student researchers
*14:32.040- 14:33.440* :  has made a giant step
*14:33.440- 14:35.600* :  towards solving one of archaeologist's
*14:35.600- 14:36.460* :  greatest puzzles.
*14:36.660- 14:38.180* :  Using artificial intelligence,
*14:38.700- 14:39.820* :  the scholars successfully
*14:39.820- 14:42.260* :  read the contents of a child's scroll
*14:42.300- 14:44.080* :  that was buried during the eruption
*14:44.080- 14:46.840* :  of Mount Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago
*14:47.280- 14:48.400* :  Rory Gala Moore reports.
*14:49.460- 14:50.600* :  In the 18th century,
*14:50.700- 14:53.140* :  archaeologists made a remarkable discovery
*14:53.140- 14:54.300* :  in Herculaneum.
*14:54.680- 14:56.380* :  They unearthed an entire library
*14:56.380- 14:57.680* :  for pyroscrolls
*14:57.900- 14:59.340* :  from the ruins of a Roman villa.
*14:59.720- 15:00.880* :  But there was a problem,
*15:01.280- 15:02.760* :  any attempt to open the scorched
*15:02.760- 15:04.180* :  documents ended in failure.
*15:04.520- 15:05.820* :  They were simply too fragile
*15:06.220- 15:07.160* :  and crumbled to dust.
*15:07.780- 15:09.360* :  Now researchers have used AI
*15:09.360- 15:12.040* :  to decipher CT scans of the scrolls
*15:12.420- 15:14.040* :  after years of painstaking work,
*15:14.320- 15:16.000* :  they revealed a previously unknown
*15:16.000- 15:17.160* :  philosophical text,
*15:17.160- 15:19.100* :  discussing senses and pleasure.
*15:19.640- 15:21.060* :  It paves the way for the hundreds
*15:21.060- 15:23.300* :  of remaining scrolls to be translated.
*15:23.860- 15:25.060* :  The breakthrough has generated
*15:25.460- 15:26.280* :  huge excitement
*15:26.740- 15:27.680* :  and a cash reward
*15:27.680- 15:31.420* :  of $700,000 for three researchers.
*15:31.900- 15:32.700* :  Rory Gala Moore.
*15:35.480- 15:38.100* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*15:38.680- 15:39.340* :  Last Friday,
*15:39.340- 15:41.200* :  she put a post on her Instagram
*15:41.900- 15:42.720* :  and a day later,
*15:42.720- 15:44.920* :  Ms. Bunum posted a video
*15:45.280- 15:47.520* :  saying that she had faked her demise.
*15:48.460- 15:49.920* :  Stay tuned to find out why
*15:49.920- 15:51.240* :  an Instagram post
*15:51.240- 15:53.340* :  by a famous Indian actress
*15:53.940- 15:55.120* :  has sparked fury.
*16:03.500- 16:04.780* :  The independent body that
*16:04.780- 16:06.820* :  refused how the owner of Facebook
*16:06.820- 16:08.540* :  moderates its content has said
*16:08.540- 16:10.800* :  the firm should label fake posts
*16:10.800- 16:12.080* :  rather than remove them.
*16:12.440- 16:13.440* :  The oversight board said
*16:13.440- 16:15.480* :  meta was right not to take down
*16:15.480- 16:17.240* :  a fake video of President Biden,
*16:17.760- 16:18.980* :  but said its policies needed
*16:19.520- 16:20.780* :  tightening ahead of the election
*16:20.780- 16:21.980* :  in the United States.
*16:22.360- 16:23.500* :  Our technology reporter,
*16:23.840- 16:24.840* :  Chris Valance has more.
*16:25.780- 16:27.380* :  The video of President Biden
*16:27.380- 16:29.140* :  had been edited to make it appear
*16:29.140- 16:31.160* :  he had inappropriately touched
*16:31.220- 16:32.620* :  his granddaughter's chest.
*16:33.400- 16:35.900* :  A accompanying text also falsely
*16:36.380- 16:37.740* :  suggested he was a pedophile.
*16:38.660- 16:39.800* :  But his spite of its
*16:39.800- 16:40.880* :  libelous content,
*16:41.320- 16:42.480* :  the video did not
*16:42.480- 16:44.260* :  fulfill of meta's policies.
*16:45.140- 16:45.620* :  Currently,
*16:45.620- 16:47.100* :  these apply only to videos
*16:47.340- 16:48.200* :  that have been manipulated
*16:48.200- 16:50.840* :  using AI in which people appear
*16:50.840- 16:53.220* :  to say things they did not say.
*16:54.100- 16:55.500* :  But AI-generated audio
*16:55.500- 16:56.920* :  is also not covered.
*16:57.220- 16:58.480* :  Concern about that has been
*16:58.480- 16:59.960* :  growing after a fake call
*16:59.960- 17:01.000* :  from President Biden
*17:01.400- 17:03.120* :  urged people not to vote
*17:03.540- 17:05.420* :  in a democratic primary election.
*17:06.100- 17:07.280* :  We know the value of voting
*17:07.280- 17:09.080* :  democratic when our votes count.
*17:09.180- 17:10.860* :  It's important that you save your vote
*17:10.920- 17:12.160* :  for the November election.
*17:12.500- 17:14.440* :  Louise Stewart of the Oversight Board
*17:14.800- 17:15.820* :  said meta's policies
*17:16.300- 17:17.600* :  didn't make much sense.
*17:17.800- 17:18.840* :  They were focusing on
*17:19.440- 17:21.440* :  removing content altered by AI,
*17:21.440- 17:22.960* :  but other content which
*17:22.960- 17:24.340* :  had been altered by less sophisticated
*17:24.340- 17:26.380* :  means was overlooked by those policies.
*17:26.860- 17:28.560* :  And we think it's absolutely crucial
*17:28.560- 17:31.760* :  in this 2024 election year
*17:31.760- 17:32.860* :  when there's going to be much more
*17:32.860- 17:34.560* :  of this kind of content online
*17:35.020- 17:36.880* :  than we think they need to take steps to tackle it.
*17:37.080- 17:37.760* :  For its part,
*17:38.000- 17:39.280* :  meta said it would respond
*17:39.280- 17:41.300* :  to the board's recommendations.
*17:41.940- 17:43.680* :  Chris Valance with that report.
*17:45.000- 17:48.180* :  In India, the actress and model Poonam Pandey
*17:48.180- 17:50.300* :  has caused uproar on social media
*17:50.300- 17:53.100* :  by faking her own death from cervical cancer.
*17:53.600- 17:54.280* :  Late last week,
*17:54.280- 17:55.240* :  a statement was released
*17:55.240- 17:57.080* :  on her official Instagram account
*17:57.080- 17:58.880* :  saying the 32-year-old actress
*17:58.880- 18:00.320* :  had bravely fought the disease
*18:00.880- 18:01.300* :  and died.
*18:01.700- 18:03.120* :  The BBC's Jan Harvey Mule
*18:03.120- 18:05.180* :  in India told LaQuessa Burak
*18:05.500- 18:06.540* :  more about what happened.
*18:07.300- 18:08.000* :  Last Friday,
*18:08.000- 18:10.520* :  she put a post on her Instagram page
*18:10.520- 18:12.260* :  that claimed that she had died
*18:12.260- 18:13.500* :  with cervical cancer.
*18:13.900- 18:15.480* :  This came as a shock to her
*18:15.820- 18:17.580* :  about 1.3 million followers
*18:18.200- 18:19.640* :  because just days ago,
*18:19.640- 18:21.600* :  she was quite active on social media.
*18:21.960- 18:22.480* :  So soon,
*18:22.480- 18:24.480* :  obituary started pouring in
*18:24.480- 18:26.760* :  and her colleagues and co-stars
*18:26.760- 18:29.180* :  posted messages about their sadness.
*18:29.180- 18:31.060* :  People started talking about it.
*18:31.600- 18:32.440* :  And a day later,
*18:32.440- 18:34.620* :  Ms Poonam posted a video
*18:34.620- 18:37.220* :  saying that she had faked her demise
*18:37.220- 18:39.940* :  as a part of her social media campaign.
*18:40.440- 18:42.540* :  And that got many people angry
*18:42.540- 18:44.020* :  because this is not the first time
*18:44.020- 18:45.980* :  something like this has happened with her.
*18:46.080- 18:47.680* :  Way back in 2011,
*18:47.680- 18:49.620* :  she had promised that she would strip
*18:49.620- 18:51.060* :  for the Indian cricket team
*18:51.060- 18:52.300* :  if they've won World Cup.
*18:52.440- 18:54.700* :  And that is something that shot her to fame.
*18:54.920- 18:56.520* :  So many condemned her for,
*18:56.520- 18:57.600* :  you know, talking about
*18:57.600- 18:59.500* :  cervical cancer like that.
*18:59.800- 19:01.200* :  What kind of things were people saying?
*19:01.440- 19:03.480* :  Some called it morbidity marketing.
*19:03.860- 19:05.320* :  Some criticized the media
*19:05.320- 19:08.240* :  because media reported a death without verifying.
*19:08.660- 19:10.300* :  But then journalists also came in
*19:10.300- 19:12.460* :  and said that it was her Instagram page,
*19:12.460- 19:15.160* :  her official page that was reporting her demise.
*19:15.920- 19:18.600* :  Later, the agency behind her campaign
*19:18.600- 19:20.500* :  came forward and apologized
*19:21.280- 19:22.960* :  because many people felt triggered
*19:22.960- 19:24.240* :  by the whole campaign.
*19:24.520- 19:26.800* :  Poonam has maintained that he has got people
*19:26.800- 19:28.300* :  talking about the issue
*19:28.760- 19:31.220* :  because cervical cancer is a big problem in India.
*19:31.720- 19:33.040* :  But critics are questioning
*19:33.040- 19:34.720* :  whether her act was
*19:34.720- 19:37.660* :  demeaning the seriousness about this disease.
*19:38.240- 19:41.220* :  And people are saying that one should not joke about death.
*19:41.280- 19:43.780* :  There are some who are also making memes
*19:43.780- 19:45.100* :  about the whole incidence.
*19:45.320- 19:48.260* :  I know that India alone accounts for a quarter
*19:48.600- 19:51.640* :  of the worldwide burden of cervical cancer.
*19:51.880- 19:53.900* :  How seriously is it taken by the government?
*19:54.460- 19:57.080* :  So, cervical cancer is actually the second most common
*19:57.080- 19:58.800* :  cancer among Indian women.
*19:58.800- 20:02.720* :  It claims over 77,000 lives every year.
*20:03.340- 20:05.300* :  Those deaths could actually be avoided
*20:05.300- 20:08.360* :  with HPV vaccines and medical tests
*20:08.360- 20:10.620* :  that can reduce the risk of death.
*20:10.660- 20:12.740* :  But there is still not much awareness
*20:12.740- 20:15.940* :  about these vaccines or the cancer itself.
*20:16.440- 20:18.320* :  And that is why government actually
*20:18.320- 20:20.900* :  just a few days ago launched a scheme
*20:20.900- 20:23.640* :  where they say that they're going to provide free vaccines
*20:23.640- 20:26.300* :  and affordable vaccines to young girls.
*20:26.900- 20:29.380* :  So, many are actually questioning the timing
*20:29.380- 20:32.260* :  of Poonam's post because just a few days ago
*20:32.260- 20:34.220* :  the government had made that announcement.
*20:34.220- 20:35.800* :  And now this happens.
*20:36.600- 20:39.060* :  Majority people are saying that this is not
*20:39.060- 20:42.220* :  the way you should talk about death by cancer
*20:42.220- 20:44.840* :  because it's quite traumatic for people
*20:44.840- 20:46.560* :  who have already suffered through this
*20:46.700- 20:49.380* :  or for people who have their relatives
*20:49.380- 20:51.400* :  going through cervical cancer.
*20:52.600- 20:54.560* :  And after she'd finished the conversation,
*20:54.680- 20:56.640* :  Jen Harvey told Uquessa Burek
*20:56.640- 20:58.560* :  that she herself did not know
*20:59.060- 21:01.380* :  about cervical cancer until she was 21.
*21:02.840- 21:05.540* :  The former Barcelona footballer Danny Alves
*21:05.540- 21:08.140* :  has been denied a request for his rape trial
*21:08.140- 21:08.800* :  to be delayed.
*21:09.220- 21:11.140* :  The Brazilian went on trial in Barcelona
*21:11.140- 21:14.280* :  on Monday accused of the rape of a 23-year-old woman
*21:14.280- 21:16.120* :  in a nightclub toilet in the city.
*21:16.700- 21:19.220* :  Alves also played for top European teams
*21:19.220- 21:20.680* :  including Paris Saint-Germain
*21:21.140- 21:22.040* :  and Juventus.
*21:22.160- 21:23.900* :  I got the latest from our correspondent
*21:23.900- 21:25.400* :  Guy Hegeco in Spain.
*21:26.320- 21:30.500* :  The allegation is that in the VIP section
*21:30.800- 21:32.460* :  of a nightclub in Barcelona
*21:32.540- 21:34.260* :  in December 2022,
*21:34.980- 21:37.220* :  Danny Alves lured this young woman
*21:37.220- 21:38.640* :  who was 23 at the time
*21:39.040- 21:40.880* :  into a bathroom there
*21:41.120- 21:42.960* :  and then raped her
*21:43.500- 21:44.700* :  and then left the nightclub.
*21:45.140- 21:46.080* :  Soon after that,
*21:46.080- 21:47.920* :  the woman acclaims that he raped her
*21:48.340- 21:50.240* :  and then reported this to the people
*21:50.240- 21:51.400* :  in the nightclub and the police
*21:51.540- 21:53.440* :  immediately closed down the bathroom
*21:53.440- 21:55.360* :  itself and started investigating.
*21:55.400- 21:58.760* :  But these are obviously very serious allegations
*21:59.560- 22:02.680* :  and if he were to be found guilty at the end of this trial,
*22:02.680- 22:06.680* :  he could face a jail term of up to 12 years.
*22:07.020- 22:10.340* :  What do we know so far about the evidence against him?
*22:10.680- 22:13.400* :  The prosecution says it has a good deal of evidence
*22:13.400- 22:16.000* :  including video evidence from inside the nightclub
*22:16.300- 22:17.700* :  of the movements of Danny Alves
*22:17.700- 22:19.400* :  and the young woman who said she was raped.
*22:19.980- 22:22.320* :  Also evidence from witnesses who were there.
*22:22.320- 22:24.440* :  We've already heard from the cousin
*22:24.960- 22:27.220* :  of the woman who says Danny Alves raped her
*22:27.500- 22:28.580* :  who was testifying today.
*22:29.420- 22:31.600* :  Also forensic evidence, which is yet to come
*22:31.600- 22:34.500* :  but for example, fingerprints from inside the bathroom.
*22:34.640- 22:35.720* :  With Danny Alves, of course,
*22:35.720- 22:37.200* :  denies these allegations
*22:37.200- 22:40.000* :  and says that this encounter was completely consensual.
*22:40.320- 22:43.800* :  Danny Alves, of course, joins a list of top flight players
*22:43.800- 22:46.020* :  who faced accusations of rape.
*22:46.020- 22:46.800* :  And this, of course,
*22:46.800- 22:48.300* :  had an interesting time for Spain
*22:48.360- 22:50.960* :  which has experienced its own Me Too movement.
*22:51.880- 22:52.800* :  Well, yes, it has.
*22:52.960- 22:54.320* :  The issue of sexual consent
*22:54.440- 22:57.200* :  has been a massive debate in Spain,
*22:57.960- 23:00.800* :  particularly because of what happened last summer
*23:00.800- 23:03.140* :  when the president of the Spanish Football Federation
*23:03.180- 23:07.160* :  with Rubialis kissed one of the Spanish women's players
*23:07.160- 23:10.020* :  who just won the World Cup on the lips in public.
*23:10.720- 23:13.200* :  And that's triggered a series of events
*23:13.240- 23:15.800* :  which led to the removal of Mr. Rubialis from his post
*23:16.020- 23:18.600* :  and a big social backlash against him.
*23:19.240- 23:21.660* :  And what was seen as a sort of Spanish version
*23:21.660- 23:22.800* :  of the Me Too movement,
*23:22.800- 23:26.100* :  whereby relations between men and women
*23:26.100- 23:28.220* :  I think was sort of perhaps recalibrated
*23:28.220- 23:30.900* :  but people started looking at them slightly differently.
*23:31.580- 23:34.200* :  And there was a feeling that the issue of consent
*23:34.200- 23:37.460* :  was suddenly much more under scrutiny.
*23:38.060- 23:38.700* :  Guy Hedgeko.
*23:39.940- 23:43.260* :  Workers at the leading South Korean construction company
*23:43.260- 23:46.240* :  the Boo Young group who are thinking of starting a family
*23:46.240- 23:50.280* :  or adding to it could become $70,000 richer.
*23:50.580- 23:52.640* :  The firm has announced a lucrative incentive
*23:52.640- 23:55.220* :  to try to help tackle Korea's birth rate
*23:55.560- 23:56.500* :  the lowest in the world.
*23:56.880- 23:58.980* :  Asia Pacific editor Celia Hatton
*23:59.020- 24:02.300* :  told Oliver Conway why the company is getting involved.
*24:03.360- 24:06.220* :  The founder of Beyond Group says that he's worried
*24:06.220- 24:09.460* :  that the country itself won't last beyond the next 20 years
*24:09.460- 24:12.560* :  if it doesn't do more to replace its population.
*24:12.660- 24:15.140* :  He cited even current military levels.
*24:15.140- 24:18.940* :  South Korea needs 200,000 new recruits per year.
*24:19.400- 24:24.960* :  In 2022 the entire country only had 250,000 babies born.
*24:24.960- 24:27.440* :  So that's the official reason.
*24:27.880- 24:30.420* :  Some are questioning the founder of the group himself.
*24:30.580- 24:32.980* :  He's already served two prison sentences
*24:32.980- 24:35.000* :  for embezzlement and tax evasion.
*24:35.000- 24:38.140* :  He's a South Korean billionaire, one of the country's richest men.
*24:38.620- 24:40.440* :  He was just pardoned last August
*24:40.440- 24:43.580* :  and allowed to return to management of his company.
*24:43.580- 24:45.720* :  So it's perhaps not so much of a surprise
*24:45.780- 24:47.440* :  that he's coming out in a big way
*24:47.960- 24:49.600* :  supporting government policies at the moment.
*24:50.060- 24:52.040* :  Might other countries follow suit?
*24:52.360- 24:54.460* :  Other countries I think are considering it
*24:54.460- 24:56.660* :  but other companies in South Korea certainly
*24:56.660- 24:58.880* :  are coming up with their own ways
*24:58.880- 25:01.840* :  of trying to tackle the low birth rate.
*25:01.840- 25:03.620* :  Like offering South Korean workers
*25:03.620- 25:07.260* :  the choice to work part time, infertility treatments
*25:07.260- 25:10.200* :  up to two years of parental leave.
*25:10.400- 25:12.880* :  I should say that Beyond Group itself has said
*25:12.880- 25:15.200* :  that if any worker at Beyond Groups
*25:15.200- 25:16.960* :  decides to have a third child,
*25:16.960- 25:21.780* :  they have the choice between accepting a $225,000 payment
*25:22.320- 25:25.180* :  or the permanent rental of an apartment.
*25:25.180- 25:26.700* :  So this company in particular
*25:26.700- 25:28.700* :  really is trying to go out on a limb
*25:29.100- 25:32.800* :  to try to encourage more births.
*25:32.800- 25:35.100* :  Even at the announcement the founder of the group
*25:35.100- 25:37.280* :  who's 84 years old, very white-haired
*25:37.580- 25:39.940* :  was surrounded by workers all holding
*25:40.420- 25:41.760* :  small children of their own.
*25:41.760- 25:43.320* :  So it's going to be interesting to see
*25:43.700- 25:45.400* :  if the birth rate even within this
*25:45.400- 25:47.520* :  one particular company in South Korea
*25:47.960- 25:50.460* :  really goes up after this announcement today.
*25:50.600- 25:51.920* :  Briefly that claim that the country
*25:52.320- 25:53.740* :  couldn't survive after 20 years.
*25:53.740- 25:54.420* :  That's quite strong.
*25:54.420- 25:56.300* :  Is it really that bad in South Korea?
*25:56.520- 25:57.420* :  Yeah, I mean, as you said,
*25:57.420- 25:59.780* :  it's the lowest birth rate in the world.
*25:59.780- 26:03.000* :  There's 0.84 births per woman.
*26:03.000- 26:05.400* :  That means that South Korea isn't even replacing
*26:05.400- 26:06.880* :  its current population.
*26:07.060- 26:08.040* :  And this has been a problem
*26:08.040- 26:10.760* :  in declining birth rate for 20 years.
*26:10.760- 26:14.420* :  So that's really an issue for South Korea
*26:14.640- 26:15.840* :  and they are really are concerned
*26:15.840- 26:17.280* :  that they just don't have enough workers.
*26:17.280- 26:18.640* :  They don't have enough soldiers
*26:19.060- 26:21.320* :  to be able to allow the country to continue.
*26:21.320- 26:22.720* :  And I should say that immigration
*26:22.860- 26:25.340* :  isn't seriously being considered as a way
*26:25.340- 26:26.540* :  to boost the population.
*26:26.600- 26:28.700* :  They're really only looking at the birth rate right now.
*26:29.340- 26:30.160* :  Syria Hatton.
*26:31.080- 26:32.780* :  Let's return to our top story that
*26:32.780- 26:35.140* :  King Charles has been treated for cancer.
*26:35.500- 26:38.420* :  Dickie Arbiter was Queen Elizabeth's press secretary
*26:38.580- 26:41.000* :  and he was media manager for Prince Charles
*26:41.000- 26:44.000* :  as he was and the late Princess Diana.
*26:44.360- 26:46.800* :  Paul Henley asked him whether the fact
*26:46.800- 26:49.040* :  that the palace has admitted this diagnosis
*26:49.660- 26:50.480* :  is unprecedented.
*26:51.400- 26:54.080* :  It is unprecedented and I think we have
*26:54.080- 26:57.060* :  to applaud the palace for having come out with something like that.
*26:57.400- 26:59.940* :  The King he is pragmatic about these things
*26:59.940- 27:02.040* :  and that's something that runs through the family.
*27:02.540- 27:04.240* :  It is something that's been diagnosed.
*27:04.420- 27:07.080* :  He is going to have to deal with it
*27:07.300- 27:10.140* :  in the way that the medics suggest that they're dealing with it.
*27:10.540- 27:13.560* :  But he will be able to carry on his constitutional role
*27:13.920- 27:15.760* :  and that is dealing with state papers
*27:15.760- 27:18.700* :  or affairs of state as well as having an audience
*27:18.700- 27:20.680* :  with his prime minister once a week.
*27:20.980- 27:23.100* :  There have of course been members of the royal family
*27:23.100- 27:25.780* :  with cancer in the past but it was kept secret
*27:25.980- 27:28.380* :  why what sort of conversations behind the scenes
*27:28.380- 27:29.420* :  took place about it.
*27:29.880- 27:32.660* :  Well I don't think you can be too sure of secret.
*27:32.660- 27:34.880* :  I remember in the mid 80s,
*27:35.020- 27:37.140* :  it was 85 or 86 Princess Margaret
*27:37.140- 27:39.180* :  went into the Royal Brompton Hospital in London
*27:39.620- 27:41.500* :  which specializes in cancer cases
*27:41.940- 27:44.520* :  and although it wasn't spelled out in so many words
*27:44.900- 27:46.800* :  the general feeling was that it was cancer
*27:46.800- 27:48.880* :  that she was having treatment there
*27:49.100- 27:51.580* :  and she came out and she did carry on until
*27:51.980- 27:54.000* :  sadly she passed away in 2002.
*27:54.740- 27:57.800* :  What it does tell us is a very more open approach
*27:57.800- 27:58.720* :  which is good.
*27:59.280- 28:00.860* :  You can't hide these things.
*28:01.140- 28:02.880* :  If the King is not seen in public,
*28:03.160- 28:05.840* :  the question asked is why isn't he being seen in public?
*28:06.200- 28:07.620* :  Is there something wrong with him?
*28:07.800- 28:10.300* :  And rather than get speculation in the media
*28:10.300- 28:11.960* :  we're just pretty good at speculating
*28:12.520- 28:14.100* :  that they come out with it and say well
*28:14.580- 28:16.360* :  he has been diagnosed with cancer
*28:16.640- 28:17.720* :  what it is we don't know
*28:17.720- 28:20.520* :  and whether Buckham Thomas in the fullness of time
*28:20.960- 28:22.800* :  remains to be seen and he is upbeat
*28:23.400- 28:25.520* :  and he is carrying on work as usual
*28:26.000- 28:28.520* :  albeit on an administrative capacity
*28:28.920- 28:30.520* :  rather than being seen out and about
*28:30.880- 28:32.540* :  and that's the part that we're frustrating
*28:33.020- 28:35.220* :  because that is job to be seen out and about
*28:35.360- 28:37.700* :  by the great British public, by the people of the Commonwealth,
*28:37.700- 28:38.900* :  by the people of the realms,
*28:39.260- 28:42.360* :  by business, by industry, by parliamentarians
*28:42.820- 28:43.960* :  and he's not able to do that.
*28:43.960- 28:46.540* :  When he's able to do that remains to be seen.
*28:46.800- 28:49.420* :  My guess is we won't see him this side of Easter
*28:49.580- 28:50.620* :  out on the public road.
*28:50.800- 28:53.860* :  Can I ask for a few words on how you think the King will cope
*28:53.980- 28:55.240* :  you've known him for a long time?
*28:56.080- 28:57.500* :  He will cope remarkably well
*28:57.500- 28:59.960* :  as one of the things that the royal family do do.
*28:59.960- 29:02.160* :  They do cope, I mean we saw the late Queen
*29:02.580- 29:04.860* :  who suffered mobility issues and we saw her
*29:05.160- 29:06.860* :  with a lot of effort getting on the balcony
*29:06.860- 29:08.580* :  at the time of the platinum Jubilee
*29:08.700- 29:11.980* :  and we saw her that marvellous sketch with parents and their
*29:12.540- 29:14.620* :  they know that things, certain things have to be done
*29:14.960- 29:17.100* :  they have to be seen as the late Queen used to say
*29:17.400- 29:18.660* :  I have to be seen to be believed
*29:19.120- 29:20.720* :  so he will cope with it
*29:21.080- 29:23.280* :  but he will be frustrated by the same token
*29:23.280- 29:25.220* :  of not being able to go out and about
*29:25.560- 29:27.360* :  and do what he does extremely well
*29:27.600- 29:29.060* :  instead that'll be undertaken
*29:29.460- 29:31.080* :  by his consort, Queen Flanella,
*29:31.500- 29:32.720* :  by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh,
*29:32.720- 29:34.980* :  by the Princess Royal and of course by the Prince of Wales
*29:35.260- 29:37.460* :  who will be back on duty is coming Wednesday.
*29:38.220- 29:41.100* :  That was Dickie Arbiter, former media manager
*29:41.100- 29:44.300* :  to Prince Charles, of course now King Charles
*29:44.940- 29:46.140* :  speaking to Paul Henley.
*29:48.900- 29:50.960* :  And that's all from us for now
*29:50.960- 29:54.440* :  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
*29:54.700- 29:56.760* :  if you want to comment on this podcast
