*00:19.160- 00:25.200* :  It tells the story of how my grandfather Charlie Chaplin and many others were caught up in a
*00:25.200- 00:32.100* :  campaign to root out communism in Hollywood. Hollywood Exiles from CBC podcasts and the BBC

*00:39.140- 00:46.740* :  World Service. I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Saturday the 3rd of February, these are
*00:46.740- 00:52.940* :  our main stories. US officials say the United States has begun airstrikes against Iranian targets
*00:52.940- 00:59.540* :  in Syria and Iraq in retaliation for Sunday's drone attack in Jordan that killed three American
*00:59.540- 01:06.120* :  military personnel. More than 800 officials in the US and Europe have signed a joint statement
*01:06.120- 01:11.700* :  saying that the governments they serve risk being complicit in war crimes in Gaza.
*01:12.840- 01:18.100* :  An Italian minister has resigned amid allegations of stolen art and corruption.
*01:21.500- 01:26.360* :  Also in this podcast. Are you woozy? How many strikes do I have? I answer the strike question.
*01:26.500- 01:31.120* :  Three. No, see something wrong with you. I have one. Two, three. That's all I have.
*01:31.900- 01:38.120* :  A scientific study suggests that real life clown fish may have the ability to count as well as
*01:38.120- 01:47.640* :  their animation counterparts. For days now the US has signaled that it was planning to retaliate
*01:47.640- 01:53.780* :  to a drone attack by an Iranian-backed group that killed three American soldiers in Jordan on Sunday.
*01:54.620- 02:00.900* :  Now five days after the deaths of those soldiers, the US has begun striking targets in Syria and Iraq.
*02:00.940- 02:05.880* :  A statement released by the Pentagon said facilities with command and control centers
*02:06.400- 02:11.640* :  were among the dozens of targets that were hit and that this was just the start of the American
*02:11.740- 02:17.520* :  response. Ben Thompson heard more about the US strikes from the BBC's senior international
*02:17.520- 02:24.520* :  correspondent, Ola Guerin, who is in Erbil in Northern Iraq. What we're not dealing with tonight
*02:24.520- 02:29.680* :  is the element of surprise. This has been very well telegraphed. In fact, there's been a countdown
*02:29.680- 02:35.800* :  going on since last Sunday since the killing of those three American service personnel in that
*02:35.800- 02:41.360* :  drone strike in Jordan. I think the important thing about this is the very fine balance
*02:42.140- 02:47.800* :  that Washington is attempting with this operation. It needs to have a strong response, strong enough
*02:47.800- 02:53.240* :  to satisfy American public opinion after the killing of three soldiers, strong enough to satisfy
*02:53.240- 03:00.840* :  Republican pressure in an election year, but not so strong that it triggers an escalating response
*03:00.840- 03:05.900* :  from the other side, from the Iranian-backed militias, or indeed from Iran itself. Now,
*03:06.500- 03:11.240* :  the messaging from both Iran and Washington in the last few days has been pretty consistent.
*03:11.240- 03:17.160* :  Both sides are saying the same thing. We don't want an escalation. We don't want a wider war.
*03:17.820- 03:22.200* :  And the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said there is a way to manage things in his
*03:22.200- 03:28.960* :  phrase so that things don't escalate further out of control. Well, now we will see if Washington
*03:28.960- 03:33.380* :  has come up with a formula, has been able to find a formula to deliver its response,
*03:33.420- 03:38.960* :  but not to escalate things, not to make a bad situation even worse. Yes, and all of that is
*03:38.960- 03:43.780* :  the very difficult balancing act that both sides have to play here, isn't it? How do you do that?
*03:43.780- 03:47.960* :  How do you send that message and the deterrent whilst not tipping this into a wider conflict?
*03:48.200- 03:52.860* :  And it's entirely possible, isn't it, that that could happen by accident. Both sides may say that
*03:52.860- 03:57.200* :  they don't want that, but if air strikes begin as we are told they have done tonight,
*03:57.200- 04:01.760* :  it is possible that this is a worrying new chapter in this conflict.
*04:01.960- 04:06.580* :  That's always the risk that I think it's a greater danger now than perhaps it has been for many
*04:06.580- 04:11.020* :  years. You'll remember that the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said this week,
*04:11.020- 04:15.600* :  this is the most dangerous time in the Middle East since the 1973 Arab-Israeli wars.
*04:15.600- 04:21.400* :  I think many people would agree with that. We are in a new moment of uncertainty with
*04:21.720- 04:26.660* :  conflicts spilling out in many different directions. We have the Iranian-backed militias
*04:26.660- 04:31.800* :  here in Iraq and in Syria, who are targeting US forces. We have Iranian-backed
*04:31.800- 04:37.900* :  Hezbollah trading fire with Israel across the Israel-Lebanan border. We have the Iranian-backed
*04:37.900- 04:42.700* :  Houthis in Yemen, who are paralyzing global shipping with attacks in the Red Sea.
*04:43.120- 04:48.560* :  And of course, we have Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza and the devastating death toll among
*04:48.560- 04:54.300* :  Palestinian civilians. The region really is a Tinder box right now, so every step has to be
*04:54.300- 05:00.360* :  very carefully measured, and however careful President Biden and his defense officials may be
*05:00.360- 05:05.540* :  in selecting targets. There is the risk that something goes wrong, and the Americans have said
*05:05.540- 05:09.900* :  the first thing we see will not be the last thing we see. In other words, this will be
*05:09.900- 05:15.300* :  a multi-tiered response. It could take place over several days in several different locations,
*05:15.400- 05:21.480* :  so we are just at the start of something now, and we don't know how far this retaliation is
*05:21.480- 05:27.120* :  going to go. The Americans may be trying not to escalate too far, but things can achieve a
*05:27.120- 05:31.940* :  momentum of their own. You know, what we have to bear in mind is this has been heavily telegraphed.
*05:32.220- 05:37.760* :  Senior Iranian militial leaders or figures who support Iran will not simply have been sitting
*05:37.760- 05:43.020* :  at their bases in the last few days waiting for the Americans to come and strike. In fact, there was
*05:43.360- 05:48.840* :  a lot of speculation on social media today in Baghdad that prominent figures, Iranian-backed
*05:48.840- 05:55.260* :  figures in various militias, had left their offices and their known locations in Baghdad in
*05:55.260- 06:00.060* :  recent days, because they weren't going to sit around to wait and be hit. So, there is no
*06:00.060- 06:04.860* :  element of surprise in this, and I think it will take tonight and maybe into the next few days
*06:04.860- 06:10.340* :  before we see whether America has managed to hit a different kind of target, but the response
*06:10.340- 06:16.660* :  from Iran is, and whether or not we are into a new moment of escalation or whether things will
*06:16.960- 06:22.480* :  stop at this for now. Yeah, and all Iran, as we should be very clear, has
*06:22.480- 06:28.120* :  denied any involvement here. It says the accusations from the US are baseless, saying it is not involved
*06:28.160- 06:33.440* :  in the decision-making of resistance groups, and by that it's referring, of course, to these
*06:33.440- 06:38.860* :  militias that are, we understand, trained, equipped, and funded by the Revolutionary Guard Corps.
*06:39.760- 06:45.280* :  There's a problem though here as in a distinction, I guess, between those movements in the region
*06:45.280- 06:52.040* :  that are directly linked to Iran, I'm thinking the hoot is Hamas, Hezbollah, and then these
*06:52.040- 06:57.100* :  separate, more, maybe disparate groups, that Iran says, look, we do not direct their actions,
*06:57.120- 07:02.180* :  what they do is up to them, and therefore it is not fair to blame us for the strikes that they
*07:02.180- 07:06.840* :  have carried out, particularly those just this week that killed those three U.S. servicemen.
*07:07.340- 07:11.800* :  Well, Iran maintains that it doesn't direct any of the members of what it called the
*07:11.800- 07:18.200* :  axis of resistance. So we're talking about Hamas and Gaza, Hezbollah and Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen,
*07:18.200- 07:24.320* :  and of course, this array of Iranian-backed militias which operate here in Iraq and also in Syria.
*07:24.780- 07:30.280* :  So Tehran's stance is we don't tell them what to do, we support them, we agree with the broad
*07:30.280- 07:35.520* :  objectives, and of course we know that the Iranians are arming and training these groups, but they
*07:35.520- 07:40.240* :  claim that they are not issuing orders and saying strike this target and strike that target.
*07:40.960- 07:46.320* :  All are garing in northern Iraq. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented display of coordinated
*07:46.320- 07:52.580* :  dissent against Israel's war on Hamas, more than 800 serving officials from the U.S. and Europe
*07:52.580- 07:58.140* :  have signed a statement which strongly criticizes Western support for Israel's attacks on Gaza,
*07:58.140- 08:04.540* :  which have killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more.
*08:04.540- 08:09.460* :  The signatories whose identities have not been revealed say they're worried that Israel's
*08:09.460- 08:14.440* :  war against Hamas could strengthen the appeal of the militant group rather than destroying it,
*08:14.800- 08:20.540* :  and that their own government's policies could amount to quote grave violations of international law.
*08:21.140- 08:25.080* :  I got more in this statement from our U.S. State Department correspondent Tom Bateman.
*08:25.740- 08:32.540* :  This is 800 serving government officials from the United States, from the European Union, and from
*08:32.540- 08:39.040* :  11 other European countries, including the UK, France and Germany. And what they have said is that
*08:39.040- 08:46.060* :  believe that their government's own policies risk contributing to a grave violation of international
*08:46.140- 08:53.320* :  laws, you say, that they say may even extend to ethnic cleansing and even genocide. So a strongly
*08:53.320- 08:59.200* :  worded statement, and what they have added is that they believe that they have used their professional
*08:59.680- 09:04.420* :  experience, their experience, in some cases, at knowledge of the region when they've been
*09:04.420- 09:09.700* :  giving advice and opinion to ministers and to policymakers, but that that advice has basically
*09:09.700- 09:14.860* :  been sidelined and ignored for what they call political and ideological reasons. And that is why
*09:14.860- 09:20.000* :  they say they have come out of this point. I mean, I was speaking to one U.S. official with 25
*09:20.000- 09:26.280* :  years of experience in national security in the U.S., who said that it was the first time this
*09:26.280- 09:31.440* :  official had done this and come out publicly suggesting that things had reached a breaking point.
*09:31.860- 09:37.160* :  And that is why there's this unprecedented statement coordinated between the U.S. and
*09:37.160- 09:43.600* :  European countries. Meanwhile, UN aid agencies say they are concerned that the fighting in Gaza
*09:44.000- 09:49.780* :  could spread to the southernmost city, Raffa, where more than a million people have fled. It's
*09:49.780- 09:54.700* :  extremely crowded there. Let's just hear from Jens Leica, who's a spokesperson for the UN
*09:54.700- 09:59.240* :  Office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. This is what he had to say about the situation
*09:59.660- 10:04.720* :  in Raffa. In recent days, thousands of Palestinians have continued to flee to the south, which is
*10:04.720- 10:11.220* :  already hosting over half the Gaza's population of some 2.3 million people. Most are living in
*10:11.220- 10:19.600* :  makeshift structures, tents or out in the open. Raffa is a pressure cooker of despair and we fear
*10:19.600- 10:25.720* :  for what comes next. And this is further adding to the pressure on Western governments over their
*10:25.720- 10:30.800* :  support from Israel. Yeah, I mean, I think what you've heard there is about, you know, these
*10:30.880- 10:35.020* :  very, very dire conditions on the ground. Of course, Israel is saying that it's going to continue
*10:35.020- 10:41.860* :  to go off to Hamas to completely erode and eliminate its capabilities. But it's really that
*10:41.860- 10:47.480* :  that's at the crux of this because what strikes me about these officials, what they've said is yes
*10:47.680- 10:53.400* :  and they're talking about the vast number of Palestinian civilians that Israel has killed
*10:53.400- 10:58.760* :  alongside what Israel says is the killing of militants. But it goes further because what these
*10:58.760- 11:04.520* :  officials are suggesting is that there is, you know, traditionally has been very strong allegiance
*11:04.520- 11:09.660* :  from European countries and the US towards Israel, extending in the case of the US to very,
*11:09.660- 11:15.140* :  very significant military support. And at the same time, they believe that the policy is failing,
*11:15.140- 11:19.720* :  that what's happened in Gaza has been, you know, massive destruction of property and lives.
*11:20.460- 11:25.600* :  But without serving Israel's own security interests, in that there is no long-term solution,
*11:25.600- 11:30.500* :  they believe from this, that it endangers the hostages being held further endangers them
*11:30.880- 11:34.980* :  and endangers stability in the region. So they're saying that in their view, the policy is
*11:34.980- 11:40.140* :  a failure and that the way in which Western support for Israel has been carried out is failing
*11:40.140- 11:44.420* :  and it's endangering their own national security interests but also the wider region. Now,
*11:44.420- 11:49.720* :  obviously, Israel would absolutely reject and it does reject all of this and says it applies
*11:49.720- 11:54.480* :  international law and accuses Hamas of hiding in civilian areas. But I think this is a very
*11:54.480- 11:58.400* :  significant number of people that have now come out. This dissent isn't new, but it's the
*11:58.420- 12:03.640* :  coordination of it between these Western nations, key allies of Israel, that is a new development.
*12:04.980- 12:10.260* :  Tom Bateman, next to the Netherlands, we've recently reported on how judges at the
*12:10.260- 12:15.620* :  International Court of Justice in the Hague have ruled that Israel must do all it can to prevent
*12:15.620- 12:22.180* :  genocide in Gaza after South Africa brought a case against it. Now, judges at the ICJ have
*12:22.180- 12:28.420* :  ruled on another genocide case, this time brought against Russia by Ukraine. The judges decided
*12:28.420- 12:35.200* :  that they did have jurisdiction to hear that case. Kiev accuses Moscow of violating international law
*12:35.680- 12:40.780* :  because it justified its invasion of Ukraine on the false grounds that it was to stop the genocide
*12:40.780- 12:47.300* :  of Russian speakers in the East and a holligan reports from the Hague. Moscow argued in launching
*12:47.300- 12:52.980* :  the lawsuit, Ukraine was abusing the genocide convention by using it as a roundabout way to get
*12:52.980- 12:59.100* :  a ruling on the overall legality of Russia's special military operation. The judges fed the ICJ
*12:59.100- 13:04.140* :  has jurisdiction to entertain Ukraine's request to find that there is no credible evidence
*13:04.140- 13:10.020* :  Kiev is committing genocide but will not rule on whether Russia's invasion or recognition of the
*13:10.020- 13:16.260* :  independence of areas in eastern Ukraine amount to a violation of the genocide convention as those
*13:16.260- 13:23.220* :  claims fall under different international laws. Anaheim, now here's a message from Oliver Conway.
*13:23.960- 13:27.560* :  Just a quick reminder that we are looking for your questions about the current state of the war
*13:27.560- 13:33.040* :  in Ukraine for a special edition of the global news pod to mark the second anniversary of the invasion.
*13:33.040- 13:37.940* :  We'll get answers from the team at Ukraine cast, so if you're wondering whether some in
*13:37.940- 13:43.200* :  Ukraine would be willing to sacrifice occupied territory for peace or what's the impact of so
*13:43.200- 13:48.960* :  many young men from Russia being killed in Ukraine, then please email us at globalpodcast at
*13:48.960- 13:55.960* :  bbc.co.uk or tweet at globalnewspod and if possible, record your question as a voice note.
*13:56.280- 14:00.160* :  Thank you. Now let's turn to Sudan where the UN's
*14:00.160- 14:05.820* :  World Food Programme says it's receiving reports of people dying of starvation in the country.
*14:06.520- 14:12.480* :  Two warlords have been fighting for control since last April. The violence erupted in the
*14:12.480- 14:18.800* :  capital cartoon but has since spread to other regions of Sudan like Darfur and South and North
*14:18.800- 14:24.500* :  Kordafan. Millions of people have been displaced and more than a million forced to flee the country.
*14:25.100- 14:29.780* :  And because of the worsening security, the delivery of aid is becoming increasingly
*14:29.780- 14:35.680* :  perilous. Julian Marshall spoke to Michael Dunford, regional director for East Africa for the
*14:35.680- 14:42.440* :  World Food Programme or WFP. Well the situation in Sudan today is a catastrophe.
*14:43.460- 14:50.480* :  We estimate that there are over 18 million people who are acutely food insecure, acutely hungry
*14:51.280- 14:57.800* :  because of the conflict. Sudan has the largest number of internally displaced people
*14:58.560- 15:05.520* :  across the globe today and 1.7 million Sudanese have already left and crossed into places like
*15:05.520- 15:14.220* :  Chad and South Sudan. So unless we get an end to the fighting, unless we get access to the
*15:14.220- 15:21.680* :  populations, we fear the situation is going to continue to deteriorate and a very real
*15:21.680- 15:28.780* :  possibility of people dying of hunger. Has that already been happening though, people dying of
*15:28.780- 15:38.300* :  starvation? Certainly we fear that the numbers of people severely impacted is increasing and
*15:38.300- 15:45.540* :  certainly there are pockets of people who will have perished as a result of a lack of food and
*15:45.540- 15:54.220* :  other services. How has it come to this? Unfortunately Sudan has now been in a civil war for the
*15:54.220- 16:02.600* :  last almost 10 months and the whole system within the country is in the process of collapsing.
*16:02.600- 16:09.540* :  I was talking to a colleague recently, their point was that Sudan was no longer on a cliff edge,
*16:09.920- 16:14.640* :  it had already fallen off the cliff and the question is how far will it fall?
*16:15.700- 16:22.560* :  As a result we simply need the end to the conflict because WFP and other humanitarian actors
*16:22.640- 16:29.320* :  are not able to scale up our response to the extent required to meet all of the needs across
*16:29.320- 16:35.640* :  the country. And why is that? Is it because of the continuing conflict and problems of access?
*16:37.000- 16:44.380* :  Absolutely. The conflict is in areas which are preventing either us from reaching the population
*16:44.380- 16:50.400* :  or is forcing populations to leave those locations and move elsewhere. So it's a constant
*16:50.400- 16:57.260* :  churn of people moving to different parts of the country and it just makes it increasingly
*16:57.260- 17:03.860* :  difficult for WFP to be able to reach them at the scale required. So what kind of challenges does
*17:03.860- 17:13.940* :  the WFP face in trying to bring aid to those who need it in Sudan? So the challenges are enormous.
*17:13.940- 17:19.800* :  First and foremost we simply do not have the levels of funding that we require. We need over 200
*17:19.860- 17:25.840* :  million dollars in the next six months to be able to respond at the scale required.
*17:26.700- 17:33.160* :  Beyond that, at the start of the conflict we lost many of our assets, our offices, our warehouses
*17:33.160- 17:38.120* :  were rated, our commodities were looted. So we really had to start all over again.
*17:39.180- 17:46.040* :  And now it's a case of once we get food in can we move the trucks down the roads into the
*17:46.040- 17:52.040* :  locations? How do we negotiate the cross-line, the cross-border operations that are necessary?
*17:52.680- 17:57.580* :  Do we have the partners on the ground who can do the distributions? Can we reach the populations

*18:36.500- 18:43.100* :  behind the glitz and glamour. And for a while, those suspicions grew into something much bigger
*18:43.100- 18:47.980* :  and much darker. Are you a member of the Communist Party or have you ever been a member of the

*19:45.720- 19:51.040* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. In Italy, a junior culture minister in the
*19:51.040- 19:57.340* :  right-wing government of Georgia Maloney has resigned amid allegations of stolen art and corruption.
*19:58.140- 20:02.700* :  The minister, Vittorio Scarby, made the announcement on Friday at an event which was
*20:02.700- 20:07.540* :  being televised at the time. Our Europe regional editor Alice Adley has more.
*20:08.280- 20:13.980* :  71-year-old Vittorio Scarby announced his resignation to a shocked audience while
*20:20.760- 20:26.420* :  speaking at an event in Milan. Mr. Scarby, who denies any wrongdoing, has raised eyebrows in
*20:26.420- 20:33.420* :  the past for using profanity and making sexist comments during public appearances. In January,
*20:33.420- 20:40.180* :  prosecutors said they were investigating whether a painting he owned allegedly by the 17th-century
*20:40.180- 20:47.640* :  artist Rutilio Manetti had been stolen and modified to hide its origins. Separately, he's being
*20:47.640- 20:53.540* :  investigated for allegedly accepting lucrative fees for speaking at cultural events.
*20:54.500- 20:59.280* :  Alice Adley, since being appointed to head Turkey's central bank nine months ago,
*20:59.780- 21:04.580* :  Hafiz Gey Aircan, the first woman to hold the post and former Wall Street banker,
*21:05.000- 21:09.880* :  has been leading a successful economic turnaround. She's managed to bring down Turkey's
*21:09.880- 21:14.780* :  soaring inflation after President Urduan stopped going against conventional economic thinking
*21:15.180- 21:19.900* :  by insisting interest rates be kept low. But now she's announced that she's stepping down to
*21:19.900- 21:26.140* :  protect her family after allegations of nepotism, which she says are untrue. I asked a reporter
*21:26.140- 21:30.640* :  in Ankara, Vittorio Craig, if her resignation had come as a shock.
*21:31.680- 21:37.460* :  For Turkey, nothing really is a shock. But yes, this is a shock resignation tonight,
*21:37.460- 21:41.400* :  because there had been these allegations that have been swirling in the local media
*21:41.960- 21:46.500* :  that Aircan's father had been involved in the dismissal of one of the central bank's
*21:46.940- 21:51.420* :  employees. And Ms. Aircan herself had come out and denied these allegations. She said she was
*21:51.420- 21:55.840* :  going to use the full force of the law to defend herself and her family. She said that these
*21:55.840- 22:00.800* :  allegations were false. And President Urduan last week on Wednesday came out and essentially
*22:00.800- 22:05.340* :  backed her and said, you know, that this was part of an effort to derail an economic turnaround
*22:05.340- 22:12.000* :  that she had been one of the chief architects of. And do we have any idea why she's chosen to go now?
*22:12.320- 22:16.760* :  It was a very emotional tweet. It was several paragraphs long. It definitely wasn't something
*22:16.760- 22:21.780* :  that had been pre-written or looked as though it had been signed off by, you know, many layers of
*22:21.780- 22:26.640* :  bureaucracy. She said that she came back to Turkey after having lived in the US for a number of
*22:26.640- 22:30.700* :  years. She worked on Wall Street. She was sort of seen as a person who was going to bring about
*22:30.700- 22:35.920* :  economic orthodoxy to Turkey, which was much needed to fight red-hot inflation. She talked
*22:36.200- 22:41.280* :  specifically about her child who isn't even two years old yet as one of the reasons for leaving
*22:41.280- 22:46.580* :  the job. The final line in her post on X said that serving as the central bank of an herbal quote
*22:46.580- 22:52.240* :  be the greatest legacy I leave to my child. But ultimately, you know, she expressed that it was
*22:52.640- 22:56.460* :  what she called the smear campaign that was the reason for this resignation. She said that
*22:56.460- 23:01.580* :  it was bringing a lot of distraction to the central bank. And crucially, the finance minister came
*23:01.580- 23:06.260* :  out about the same time as the central bank governor tweeted and said that President Urduan is
*23:06.260- 23:12.160* :  fully backing this economic turnaround plan, so that laying to rest any fears that this is a
*23:12.160- 23:17.720* :  U-turn in policy. Where does this all leave the Turkish economy, especially as we've seen a
*23:17.720- 23:23.840* :  succession of central bank heads in recent years? Yes, five in the last five years, if you can
*23:23.840- 23:29.080* :  believe it. But like I said, central bank governor Erkin was the one who sort of helped engineer
*23:29.080- 23:34.020* :  this economic turnaround. And in that time, they implemented this aggressive plan to raise interest
*23:34.020- 23:39.180* :  rates. But in the time that those rates have risen, inflation has begun to cool. And this is
*23:39.180- 23:45.180* :  a long process. And this is something that both Miss Erkin and the finance minister have reiterated
*23:45.180- 23:50.040* :  to the Turkish public that this economic turnaround will take time. And so the fact that the finance
*23:50.040- 23:54.880* :  minister tonight has said the president continues to back this plan is a good sign for the Turkish
*23:54.880- 24:00.500* :  economy. Victoria Craig and President Urduan has now named a replacement to head the central bank,
*24:00.500- 24:08.600* :  the ex-Amazon economist Fati Karahan. Researchers here in London say a blood test could help
*24:08.600- 24:15.220* :  pinpoint the underlying cause of injury in newborn babies. Some three million infants a year
*24:15.220- 24:21.820* :  worldwide are born with brain injury through hypoxia. That's a lack of oxygen. When that happens,
*24:21.820- 24:28.640* :  the results can be devastating. The babies can die or develop disabilities. Those effects are
*24:28.840- 24:34.080* :  specially testing in developing countries. The findings were published in the Journal of the American
*24:34.080- 24:40.640* :  Medical Association Network Open. Krupa Padi asked Sudhin Tael, professor of perinatal neuroscience
*24:40.640- 24:47.680* :  at Imperial College London and the lead investigator, how the study worked. So we looked at something
*24:47.680- 24:54.080* :  called expression of genes. So in our blood, there are hundreds and thousands of genes. So for
*24:54.080- 24:58.860* :  example, if you take a bar of chocolate, immediately some genes will get switched on asking
*24:58.860- 25:04.180* :  yourself to produce more insulin. So all the time, all the time, these genes are getting switched
*25:04.180- 25:09.460* :  on and off. So what we did was to take some blood from a group of babies with this brain injury
*25:09.460- 25:15.900* :  from a high-income country and also from South Asia. And then we compared how these expressions are
*25:16.260- 25:22.180* :  the same or the different. So what we found was on the patterns was completely different. In
*25:22.580- 25:27.300* :  high-income countries, it was related to an acute event, certain hypoxia happening. And often,
*25:27.300- 25:32.600* :  there is a clear cause why that's the case. But in South Asia, it is more like an intimidating
*25:32.600- 25:38.300* :  hypoxia pattern and there was no clear, you know, clinical reason why that was happening.
*25:38.560- 25:43.620* :  That's an extraordinary finding because many will associate the deprivation of oxygen to
*25:44.240- 25:50.480* :  a difficult labor and problems in those final hours of labor as well.
*25:51.280- 25:57.260* :  Can you just explain to us when a baby is deprived of oxygen what happens and what are the
*25:57.260- 26:02.420* :  consequences? That's really important to understand. So if you imagine the normal labor process,
*26:02.740- 26:07.440* :  you know, every time the uterus contracts, there's hypoxia and less blood flow to the baby's brain.
*26:07.740- 26:12.400* :  But if the baby is healthy, baby can't tolerate that process quite well. Unless something
*26:12.400- 26:17.200* :  catastrophic happens, you know, like we said, something goes wrong just before birth or is bleeding
*26:17.200- 26:22.380* :  and the brain injury happens. But if this baby is already stressed, chronically stressed,
*26:22.400- 26:27.240* :  it could be because of their undernotration, some infection and all those things going on.
*26:27.380- 26:31.420* :  The baby cannot even tolerate the normal hypoxic process of the labor and that is
*26:31.640- 26:36.240* :  leading to hypoxia brain injury. So we think in the population, we looked in
*26:36.540- 26:40.780* :  a South Asian countries, these babies are already stressed in the womb and that they cannot
*26:40.780- 26:44.740* :  tolerate the normal labor process and then getting hypoxic injuries, a consequence of that.
*26:45.140- 26:50.060* :  So if you look at the overall numbers, around 2 to 3 million babies are affected worldwide
*26:50.060- 26:55.860* :  and they're about 1 million Thai. So the numbers are as big as COVID, but it's kind of an
*26:55.860- 27:03.320* :  invisible pandemic and we are not really focused until now. Professor Sudden Taya from Imperial
*27:03.320- 27:09.460* :  College London. Now to the world of tech. Apple's high spec vision pro headset was launched on Friday,
*27:09.460- 27:15.840* :  but in the United States only. Some experts call this device revolutionary and game-changing,
*27:15.840- 27:21.500* :  but others have doubts. The headset's eye tracking technology can function by monitoring
*27:21.500- 27:27.860* :  just one dominant eye. So what is it like? James Reynolds spoke to Zoe Kleinman, the BBC
*27:27.860- 27:33.000* :  Technology Editor, and Joanna Stern, the personal technology colonist at the Wall Street Journal.
*27:33.000- 27:38.780* :  First of all, I think it's a really interesting device. I mean, let's start with the fact that it's
*27:38.780- 27:44.220* :  three and a half thousand dollars, right? This is not going to be the version of this headset that
*27:44.220- 27:50.900* :  everybody buys. I have tried a lot of headsets in the in the course of my job and it's definitely
*27:50.900- 27:55.760* :  up there with the best ones. I think Joanne might disagree with me here, but some people have said
*27:55.760- 28:00.580* :  that they found it quite heavy on their head. I didn't. And the reason for that is that the battery
*28:00.580- 28:04.760* :  pack is separate. So the battery pack sits next to you and you can charge it as you go along,
*28:04.760- 28:10.560* :  which means you don't have to have it sitting on your head. The interesting thing about it, I
*28:10.560- 28:16.360* :  thought, is actually how ordinary it is. When you put it on and you look at the screen in front of you,
*28:16.360- 28:21.060* :  it is like looking at an iPhone screen. If you have an iPhone, you'll recognise the apps. I looked
*28:21.060- 28:26.100* :  at beautiful photos, I looked at videos. It was very much a demonstration that was geared towards
*28:26.100- 28:31.260* :  doing stuff I do all the time on my phone. And to be honest with you, I sort of found myself thinking,
*28:31.260- 28:34.800* :  why am I doing this? Why do I need to put on a headset to do what I can do on my phone?
*28:34.800- 28:41.200* :  I realise my theory here is that this is eventually going to replace the phone. It won't look like
*28:41.200- 28:44.880* :  the ski goggles. It looks like now. It will look much more like a pair of glasses. But I think
*28:45.200- 28:49.080* :  this potentially is how Apple sees the future. You know, something's going to replace phones
*28:49.080- 28:53.420* :  at some point. Is it going to be a pair of glasses? And Joanne has said from the Wall Street Journal,
*28:53.420- 28:58.460* :  I'm half in the corner of my eye, looking at a video of you trying on the headset, which as Zoe
*28:58.460- 29:03.460* :  says does look like a pair of ski goggles. Or to me, almost like a snorkeling mask. How did you
*29:03.460- 29:07.380* :  find it, Joanne? Yeah, well, I wore them skiing. I thought that was what I should do. So in my
*29:07.420- 29:12.320* :  video review, you'll see me on the mountain wearing them. I didn't ski for long in them, but I did
*29:12.320- 29:16.220* :  try it, which is kind of remarkable because I was actually able to ski for a little bit of time
*29:16.220- 29:21.800* :  wearing these goggles. I agree with everything said. I think, look, there's one part of this story,
*29:21.800- 29:27.200* :  which is that this is absolutely amazing and futuristic. And you put these on and you feel like
*29:27.200- 29:32.380* :  you're in a science fiction movie or novel. And I've been wearing them for pretty much nonstop for
*29:32.380- 29:37.340* :  the last week. I've been testing them in various places, including the ski hill. And there are
*29:37.340- 29:42.200* :  many times where I just think this is the future. And then there are, there's the other side of
*29:42.200- 29:48.000* :  this story where it grounds me in what's happening today. And this is heavy. It is bulky. You have to
*29:48.000- 29:52.020* :  wear a battery pack. That means you're basically strapped to the wall because that battery pack on
*29:52.020- 29:56.720* :  last two to three hours. It can get buggy. There are definitely moments where, you know, I'm like,
*29:56.720- 30:02.340* :  where did the window go? Is it? Oh, I left it in the other room. It's then there's the fact that
*30:02.340- 30:07.080* :  there are not that many apps to start, but all those things I just listed are typical of really
*30:07.080- 30:11.640* :  any first generation product. But this is to be expected. And I totally agree. This is where it's
*30:11.640- 30:15.940* :  going. I don't know who places phones one day, but it's certainly going to take the place of doing
*30:15.940- 30:20.840* :  certain things we do on our phones or our laptops. Joanna Stern from the Wall Street Journal,
*30:20.840- 30:25.800* :  before her, the BBC's Zoe Kleinman. Now to something rather more fishy.
*30:34.580- 30:39.780* :  That, of course, was a Pixar film finding Nemo, the tale of a clownfish's quest to find his
*30:39.780- 30:46.180* :  lost son. That may be a cinematic exaggeration of the clownfish's abilities, but now scientists in
*30:46.180- 30:52.800* :  Japan have done a study suggesting the colourful stripy fish may be more intelligent than we give
*30:52.800- 31:00.140* :  them credit for. Terry Egan reports. Small with white stripes on orange, clownfish may look cute,
*31:00.140- 31:05.480* :  but they're extremely territorial, especially when it comes to those of their own species.
*31:05.580- 31:11.620* :  From them, much more than from any other stripy fish, they guard their homes in the
*31:11.620- 31:18.440* :  enemies with what seems like a high level of intelligence. But scientists in Japan wanted to find
*31:18.440- 31:24.440* :  out just how they sorted out friend from foe, especially in the intricate world of reefs.
*31:25.240- 31:31.100* :  So they focused on the stripes. The researchers raised their own group of common clownfish from
*31:31.100- 31:37.760* :  the egg, making sure they didn't encounter any other enemy species. Then, after six months,
*31:37.760- 31:43.620* :  they introduced them to others of their own and other species, as well as to models painted
*31:43.620- 31:50.440* :  in different ways. That's when the behaviour of the fish suggested they were anything but clowns.
*31:50.980- 31:56.400* :  Despite having had no previous interaction, they showed a lot of aggression to those of their
*31:56.400- 32:02.180* :  own type with three stripes and diminishing levels of hostility to those with fewer stripes,
*32:02.180- 32:08.380* :  or indeed, none at all. The results indicate they can count the white bars they're looking at,
*32:08.780- 32:13.760* :  and while that may not give them the ability to dodge disaster while seeking out their relatives,
*32:13.900- 32:19.760* :  the results do tell us much more about the brain power of those fish we observe
*32:19.760- 32:37.380* :  goping around in the blue. Marlin from the film Finding Nemo ending that report by Tiri Egan.
*32:40.400- 32:44.640* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
