*01:19.440- 01:24.760* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at 14 hours GMT on Thursday, the 29th of February.
*01:25.220- 01:27.800* :  In his state of the nation address ahead of elections next month,
*01:27.800- 01:34.440* :  President Putin says Russia has the upper hand in Ukraine. Hamas health officials say more than 30,000
*01:34.440- 01:39.420* :  Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza and South Korean doctors
*01:39.420- 01:42.680* :  refuse to return to work despite the threat of possible arrest.
*01:45.520- 01:49.620* :  Also, in the podcast, France moves a step closer to becoming the first country to
*01:49.620- 01:55.900* :  enshrine the right to abortion in its constitution. And, I'm a leap year baby and I'm always amazed
*01:55.900- 02:01.280* :  how many people don't know really what it is. They kind of know it's that weird extra day,
*02:01.280- 02:05.700* :  you get every few years, but everyone's always quite wow, I've never met a leap year baby before.
*02:06.080- 02:09.640* :  The people who can only celebrate their birthday once every four years.
*02:14.480- 02:20.060* :  But first, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into its third year, President Putin has said
*02:20.060- 02:24.980* :  his forces have the upper hand. In his state of the nation's speech ahead of elections next month,
*02:25.400- 02:30.560* :  he claimed most Russians backed what he called the war in eastern Ukraine. But after the
*02:30.560- 02:34.760* :  French president recently refused to rule out the deployment of western troops to Ukraine,
*02:34.760- 02:41.620* :  the Russian leader had this warning. They're talking about the possibility of sending
*02:41.620- 02:47.300* :  NATO military contingents to Ukraine, but we remember the fate of those who once sent their
*02:47.300- 02:53.240* :  contingents to our country. Now the consequences for possible interventionists will be much more
*02:53.240- 02:58.240* :  tragic. And they should also understand that what they're doing now trying to scare the whole
*02:58.240- 03:04.220* :  world, it does risk a conflict with nuclear weapons, which means the destruction of civilization.
*03:04.380- 03:09.640* :  Don't they understand this? Well, our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg was at the Parliament building
*03:09.640- 03:14.640* :  for President Putin's speech and gave me his assessment. Keep in mind that there's a
*03:14.640- 03:19.280* :  presidential election coming up in two weeks' time, an election, of course, which is being run
*03:19.320- 03:24.940* :  according to the Kremlin's rules. But that's why this address today was part campaign speech,
*03:24.940- 03:30.100* :  part state of the nation and state of the world, I think, in the eyes of Vladimir Putin. So we had
*03:30.100- 03:36.540* :  all kinds of messaging going on. We had threats and warnings to the west, and we had President
*03:36.540- 03:42.760* :  Putin telling his people that Russia was stronger, that the economy was doing well, and he was promising
*03:42.760- 03:47.940* :  that life was going to get better in this country. He was talking about schools will be repaired.
*03:47.940- 03:54.000* :  He was talking about ecology, environmental matters. You name it, he spoke about it, and painted
*03:54.000- 03:58.740* :  a picture of a Russia that was going to be a much better place. Do keep in mind, though, that this
*03:58.740- 04:04.220* :  is a President who's been in power in Russia for nearly a quarter of a century. But he's still telling
*04:04.220- 04:09.580* :  his people that, you know, stick with him and life will get better. You mentioned those threats
*04:09.980- 04:14.680* :  to the west. Mr. Putin used the word nuclear as we heard a little earlier. There's also a report in
*04:14.680- 04:20.120* :  the Financial Times today which says leaked files show Russia has a low bar for the use of
*04:20.120- 04:25.340* :  tactical nuclear weapons. Should we be getting more worried? I think we have to be a bit cautious,
*04:25.780- 04:30.820* :  right? I think Vladimir Putin in those comments was responding, it seems to me, to comments made
*04:30.820- 04:37.740* :  by President Macron recently, who did not rule out sending troops to Ukraine. But there is no
*04:37.740- 04:43.260* :  suggestion yet that that's going to happen, and certainly no suggestion on a pan-nato level
*04:43.260- 04:49.320* :  that NATO is about to put boots on the ground in Ukraine. But responding to those comments,
*04:49.320- 04:54.720* :  I think this was a not-so-subtle hint from the Kremlin leader that should that happen,
*04:54.720- 05:01.200* :  Russia will see that as a threat, as a major threat to its national security, and just reminding
*05:01.200- 05:06.580* :  western nations that Russia has a whole array of weaponry that it would be prepared to use.
*05:06.880- 05:11.580* :  And did he sound more confident than before given the recent successes Russia has had in some
*05:11.580- 05:15.620* :  parts of the battlefield? Well, I think going back over the last few months, he sounded increasingly
*05:15.620- 05:21.880* :  confident, especially since the failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive last year. You know,
*05:21.880- 05:26.920* :  every time Vladimir Putin makes a speech on television, he seems more confident that at some point,
*05:26.920- 05:31.840* :  Russia is going to emerge victorious from this war. Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*05:32.720- 05:37.580* :  The number of people killed in the war between Hamas and Israel is now well into the tens of
*05:37.580- 05:44.220* :  thousands. About 1200 died in southern Israel and the brutal surprise attack by Hamas,
*05:44.640- 05:48.680* :  along with a similar number of Palestinian fighters. Others have been killed on the Israel
*05:48.680- 05:55.020* :  Lebanon border as well as in the occupied West Bank. But the vast majority, more than 30,000
*05:55.020- 06:00.400* :  according to the Hamas health ministry, have died in Gaza, where Israel says it's trying to wipe out
*06:00.400- 06:06.560* :  terrorists. The latest incident in the Palestinian territory reportedly killed dozens of people waiting
*06:06.560- 06:12.300* :  for food aid, as I heard from our Jerusalem correspondent, Yolanda Nell. Details still emerging
*06:12.300- 06:16.800* :  about this at the moment, and there are some graphic videos that have been posted on social media
*06:16.800- 06:22.420* :  that show emptied aid lorries and a donkey cart, apparently loaded up with dead bodies, and a
*06:22.420- 06:27.860* :  journalist who was at the scene told the BBC that early this morning, aid lorries were finally
*06:27.860- 06:33.480* :  able to enter into this part of northern Gaza, and that there were big crowds that gathered there
*06:33.820- 06:39.420* :  waiting for the supplies to arrive, things like bags of flour. As people made their way away from
*06:39.420- 06:44.400* :  the scene, with whatever they'd managed to get from the aid lorries, the witness saying that
*06:44.400- 06:50.580* :  Israeli tanks opened fire, and that as well as something like 70 people having been killed,
*06:51.060- 06:55.840* :  and they were taken to various hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip, there were also
*06:55.840- 07:00.320* :  many more people who were injured as well. Now we've just had the Israeli military giving an
*07:00.320- 07:04.520* :  initial response saying that it has no knowledge of shelling in this area at the time.
*07:04.920- 07:10.740* :  Now that attack comes as the health ministry in Gaza said the total number of Palestinians killed
*07:10.860- 07:18.580* :  in the territory has now passed 30,000. This comes in response to the Hamas massacre of the
*07:18.580- 07:25.320* :  7th of October. And Israel said it was trying to basically take out Hamas fighters in Gaza. Do we
*07:25.320- 07:30.100* :  know how many of those are among the dead? The breakdown that we get from the data from the
*07:30.100- 07:34.940* :  Hamas-run health ministry, it's the only official source really for casualties in Gaza,
*07:35.420- 07:40.900* :  suggests that most of those who have been killed are either women or children. Now when we've
*07:40.900- 07:46.760* :  asked the Israeli military about how it views the figures, it's told the BBC that the number of
*07:46.760- 07:52.920* :  terrorists killed stands at approximately 10,000. That's the figure that we were given. I have to say
*07:52.920- 07:56.680* :  we do believe that the actual number of people who have been killed as a result of the war
*07:56.680- 08:01.600* :  is likely to be much higher because the way that these figures are counted, they don't include
*08:01.600- 08:06.780* :  dead people whose bodies are still stuck under the rubble of buildings, and it's believed that
*08:06.780- 08:11.120* :  there are thousands of those in Gaza. There are thousands of people who are still officially
*08:11.120- 08:17.360* :  just missing. And of course, there are fears that it could get worse if Israel proceeds with an
*08:17.360- 08:22.120* :  operation on RAFA where more than half of the population have now sought refuge from the fighting
*08:22.120- 08:27.260* :  elsewhere in Gaza. Yeah, and that's what's drawn so many warnings from the international community,
*08:27.340- 08:32.900* :  from aid agencies pointing out that the majority of the population of Gaza is now squeezed down
*08:32.900- 08:39.200* :  into this very small area on the border with Egypt. Israel has been insisting that military
*08:39.200- 08:44.320* :  operations must ultimately go into RAFA that plans have been drawn up for that without revealing
*08:44.320- 08:50.400* :  what those were, but that does really add to the kind of pressure at the moment on these efforts
*08:50.400- 08:57.220* :  to try to get some kind of at least a longer term truce agreed. And what we're hearing is
*08:57.220- 09:01.600* :  there's still of course a big gap between the two sides. The battery media to say there's not
*09:01.600- 09:06.680* :  been a breakthrough yet. Yoland now in Jerusalem. And since we spoke to Yoland, we've had an
*09:06.680- 09:12.740* :  update on that incident as people were waiting for aid on the edge of Gaza City. Palestinian
*09:12.740- 09:18.880* :  officials say the number who died is now more than 100 while an Israeli military source says that
*09:18.880- 09:24.980* :  Israeli troops who are coordinating the entry of aid trucks opened fire at the crowd thinking
*09:24.980- 09:30.940* :  there was a threat. An Israeli government spokesman called it a tragedy saying it was triggered
*09:30.940- 09:36.960* :  by a surging crowd. At some point the trucks were overwhelmed and the people driving the trucks,
*09:36.960- 09:43.280* :  gars and civilian drivers plowed into the crowds of people killing my understanding is tens of
*09:43.280- 09:50.280* :  people. That was Avi Heimann talking to reporters. Despite the threat of possible arrest if they
*09:50.280- 09:55.420* :  don't end their strike by today, doctors in South Korea are refusing to go back to work.
*09:55.420- 10:00.600* :  The strike involving nearly 10,000 junior doctors has caused problems in hospitals,
*10:01.240- 10:06.420* :  with even cesarean sections being postponed. Last week a woman died after seven hospitals
*10:06.420- 10:11.840* :  reportedly refused to treat her for a cardiac arrest. The head of one patient association said
*10:11.840- 10:16.920* :  the striking doctors were, quote, worse than organized criminals. Our soul can't respond
*10:16.920- 10:25.840* :  to Jean McKenzie has been looking into the dispute. This is a fierce showdown with thousands of
*10:25.840- 10:31.940* :  angry hospital doctors on one side and the government on the other. On the surface the doctors have
*10:31.940- 10:38.040* :  walked out over plans to increase the numbers within their ranks, but their real anger stems from
*10:38.040- 10:47.960* :  feeling overworked, underpaid and ignored. New opada is one of the thousands of junior doctors
*10:48.520- 10:54.080* :  who walked out of his job last week. It's been a really hard time because we work really hard
*10:54.580- 11:01.120* :  on over one hundred hours a week and we paid just twelve hundred pounds a month. In some
*11:01.120- 11:08.500* :  departments, they only have five minutes of lunch time. It's insane. But why does it matter if there
*11:08.500- 11:18.740* :  are more doctors? More doctors surely can't be a bad thing. Unlike the UK, South Korean doctors
*11:18.740- 11:23.980* :  are paid per procedure. If there are more doctors and competition heats up, they will see patients
*11:24.620- 11:32.960* :  only for profit, even making up illnesses or treatments. These arguments aren't winning the
*11:32.960- 11:40.600* :  public over. With Korea's population aging rapidly, people want more doctors on hand. But the doctors
*11:40.600- 11:47.260* :  argue this won't fix the shortages being seen in rural areas and in emergency care. The problem
*11:47.260- 11:52.420* :  is that too many doctors are opting to work in the more lucrative field of cosmetic surgery
*11:52.420- 11:56.500* :  and the private medical system here needs an overhaul, they say.
*12:00.000- 12:05.520* :  It comes one of the largest, most famous hospitals in Seoul, the Severance Hospital. These
*12:05.520- 12:12.000* :  teaching hospitals rely heavily on junior doctors. They make up as much as 40% of the medical staff.
*12:14.880- 12:19.520* :  Most of the hospital appears to be functioning. It's teeming with people. As usual,
*12:20.040- 12:25.000* :  here for cancer treatment and other long-term conditions, it's the emergency rooms that are
*12:25.000- 12:29.400* :  really feeling the shortages. Operations capacity has dropped significantly.
*12:31.240- 12:37.760* :  And young ASEA, Mrs Lee is in her 70s and has Poland cancer, and she's here today for treatment.
*12:37.820- 12:43.520* :  It's not been affected by the walk out, she says, but she's worried that other doctors might walk out
*12:43.520- 12:50.860* :  next. Where we live outside the city, there are no doctors anymore. Her husband tells me,
*12:51.400- 12:58.080* :  do you support the doctors in this strike? In our view, the doctors are being too selfish,
*12:58.160- 13:07.420* :  they have really taken the public hostage. Many operations and appointments have been postponed
*13:07.420- 13:13.400* :  while this dispute drags on, leaving nursing staff to pick up the extra work. As the head of
*13:13.400- 13:21.360* :  Korea's nursing association, Tak Young-ran explains, nurses are being forced to do the doctors' jobs
*13:21.600- 13:26.780* :  and we don't have the legal protections to do so. Our work loads are heavy and it's making us
*13:32.680- 13:37.520* :  anxious. The showdown has reached new heights. The government has given doctors until the end of
*13:37.520- 13:43.100* :  Thursday to return to work. Those who don't will be stripped of their medical licenses and could
*13:43.100- 13:50.840* :  even be arrested, it says. Are you prepared to be arrested or to lose your license over this?
*13:51.240- 13:57.740* :  I'm prepared to lose my license or arrested. I just thought that this job and medical system
*13:57.740- 14:05.360* :  is broken. If government stick to this policy, the Korea Medical System will collapse. It has no future.
*14:10.220- 14:12.860* :  Now report from South Korea by Jean McKenzie.
*14:13.540- 14:18.580* :  It seems video game makers are not immune to the wave of layoffs seen recently in the global tech
*14:18.580- 14:24.640* :  industry. Earlier this year, Microsoft announced it was cutting nearly 2,000 people or 8% of staff
*14:24.640- 14:31.060* :  from its gaming division. On Tuesday, Sony said it was losing 8% of its PlayStation employees.
*14:31.780- 14:36.780* :  Yesterday, the Californian company Electronic Arts announced it was acting 5% of its workers.
*14:37.260- 14:40.340* :  So what's going on? Tom Gurkin is our technology reporter.
*14:40.980- 14:44.840* :  Inflation is high, interest rates are high and what that means is a lot of these game companies
*14:44.840- 14:48.940* :  have a lot of debt and so they have to spend more than they used to in order to service it.
*14:49.120- 14:53.920* :  But there are other things going on as well. A lot of these big game companies have just released
*14:53.920- 14:58.400* :  big video games and of course once you've made a big video game you need lots of people to make
*14:58.520- 15:02.580* :  but suddenly you don't need quite so many people anymore. And there's another big thing happening
*15:02.580- 15:07.700* :  in gaming now where all of these services have subscriptions where you pay monthly fees for games
*15:07.700- 15:14.220* :  rather than necessarily paying the big upfront $60-70-80 and because of that there is a change
*15:14.220- 15:19.200* :  in the way that these companies are being financed. So we're not going to see like a sudden drought
*15:19.200- 15:26.280* :  of new games coming through. No, although in 2023 we had this extraordinary amount of video
*15:26.280- 15:30.620* :  games for a release. So many games competing for best game of the year that huge titles like
*15:30.620- 15:35.340* :  Starfield and Star Wars, their latest Jedi game, didn't even get mentioned of nominations.
*15:36.020- 15:41.280* :  So perhaps that might also explain what went on at EA, the layoffs coming and the cancellation
*15:41.280- 15:46.360* :  of a big upcoming Star Wars game, possibly because while they made one and it didn't really do
*15:46.360- 15:51.560* :  as well as they'd hoped. I mean how is gaming doing as a whole compared to other parts of the
*15:51.560- 15:57.560* :  entertainment industry movies or streaming services? Gaming is doing really well. This is the odd
*15:57.560- 16:03.640* :  thing about all of it. It's just changing the direction of travel. It was growing and hiring
*16:03.640- 16:07.920* :  as many people which we were saying in tech in general to be honest. Now it seems to be moving
*16:07.920- 16:14.760* :  towards efficiency. Gaming industry is still worth more than $200 billion that is an inconceivable
*16:14.760- 16:19.920* :  amount of money. It's going to grow by even more analysts projecting as much as $70 billion
*16:20.360- 16:26.380* :  and the context that $70 billion it will grow by that's more than the current size of the entire
*16:26.380- 16:32.660* :  global music industry. So people who develop games shouldn't be unnecessarily worried. It could
*16:32.660- 16:38.560* :  all bounce back. It almost certainly will bounce back but there is cause for concern for developers
*16:38.560- 16:43.020* :  and that's because at the moment it's very expensive to borrow. That means it's very expensive
*16:43.020- 16:47.320* :  to start your own gaming company. So if a lot of people have been laid off there might not necessarily
*16:47.320- 16:51.540* :  be jobs for them to go to and it might not necessarily be viable for them to start their own company.
*16:51.940- 16:56.000* :  Well that means it's very talented people might end up leaving the gaming industry altogether
*16:56.000- 17:01.020* :  and when it does come to a growth period again that talent might not be there anymore.
*17:01.560- 17:03.420* :  That technology report at Tom Gurkin.
*17:06.340- 17:11.340* :  Still to come on the podcast why Cuba is for the first time asking the world food programme to help
*17:11.340- 17:22.060* :  provide milk for its children. For just as long as Hollywood has been
*17:22.060- 17:27.840* :  Tinseltown there have been suspicions about what lurks behind the glitz and glamour.
*17:28.780- 17:33.860* :  And for a while those suspicions grew into something much bigger and much darker.
*17:34.360- 17:38.280* :  Are you a member of the Communist Party or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
*17:38.800- 17:45.280* :  I'm Una Chaplin and from CBC Podcasts and the BBC World Service this is Hollywood Exiles.
*17:46.040- 17:51.480* :  It's about a battle for the political soul of America and the battlefield was Hollywood.

*18:04.800- 18:10.740* :  I'm Kavita Puri and in the documentary from the BBC World Service I hear extraordinary
*18:10.740- 18:16.540* :  eye witness accounts that tell the story for the first time of the Bengal famine which happened
*18:16.540- 18:21.340* :  in British India in the middle of the Second World War. This series is called 3 million
*18:21.480- 18:27.580* :  that's the number of people who died and there isn't a museum, a memorial or even a plaque.
*18:27.660- 18:35.260* :  How can the memory of 3 million people just disappear? Search for the documentary wherever you get

*18:43.080- 18:47.920* :  France has moved a step closer to becoming the first country in the world to enshrine the
*18:47.920- 18:52.520* :  right to an abortion in its constitution. The move was overwhelmingly approved by the
*18:52.520- 18:55.460* :  Senate on Wednesday evening is a belladule report.
*19:05.860- 19:11.220* :  The sound of applause in the French Senate after lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to make abortion
*19:11.220- 19:17.160* :  a guaranteed freedom in France. Now the legislation has been passed in both houses.
*19:17.600- 19:22.120* :  On Monday it will go before a joint session of parliament, where it is expected to be approved by
*19:22.120- 19:33.240* :  three fifths majority. The French Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Maretti said it towards a
*19:39.220- 19:41.100* :  historic vote. This is a new page for women's rights
*19:41.100- 19:46.340* :  this vote is historic. We will be the first country in the world to write this freedom for women
*19:46.340- 19:48.980* :  to do what they want with their bodies into the constitution.
*19:53.400- 19:57.440* :  It's a moment which has been widely celebrated across political divides in France.
*19:58.400- 20:01.920* :  While there was a small gathering of anti-abortion protesters during the vote
*20:02.360- 20:06.960* :  and 50 lawmakers voted against the bill, none of the country's major political parties
*20:07.680- 20:10.200* :  represented in parliament have questioned the rights to abortion.
*20:16.060- 20:21.540* :  The measure which was promised by President Emmanuel Macron last year on International Women's Day
*20:21.920- 20:24.920* :  was triggered by the rollback in abortion rights in the United States.
*20:25.780- 20:32.540* :  In 2022 the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a 50-year-old ruling that had guaranteed
*20:32.540- 20:38.180* :  women's access to pregnancy termination. Abortion has been legal in France since 1975,
*20:39.080- 20:42.920* :  but now lawmakers are seeking to make it a guaranteed freedom in the constitution
*20:43.680- 20:46.920* :  so that future governments are unable to row back on access.
*20:47.700- 20:53.500* :  Ahead of its rubber stamping on Monday the bill is being celebrated as an unprecedented step forward
*20:53.500- 20:59.260* :  for women's rights. It's a bella duel. Tomorrow Iran holds its first parliamentary election since
*20:59.260- 21:03.840* :  the protests triggered by the death in police custody of Masa Amine in 2022.
*21:03.840- 21:09.740* :  The unrest was described as the biggest challenge to the hardline Islamic authorities since the revolution.
*21:09.820- 21:15.920* :  It was eventually put down, but demands for change remain, with many people planning to boycott
*21:15.920- 21:20.680* :  Friday's vote as an act of protest. The Iranian government is now taking action to try to
*21:20.680- 21:24.480* :  shore up turnout as I heard from the BBC's Sourush Negardari.
*21:25.040- 21:30.880* :  One thing is that they're using the state media and national TV to create enthusiasm and to
*21:30.880- 21:37.340* :  encourage people to vote. Some people also noticed that there's a leniency about how female
*21:37.340- 21:43.380* :  presenters address and now you see female presenters with more colorful clothes and
*21:43.960- 21:49.160* :  loose a job as they call it, trying to create a friendlier, more democratic,
*21:49.540- 21:54.140* :  atmosphere. You also see on live TV debates with participants who
*21:54.820- 21:59.840* :  freely express strong criticism of the establishment or the current government of President
*21:59.840- 22:04.820* :  Prime Minister Hisi. He's just seen a science that the government and establishment is trying to
*22:05.300- 22:10.340* :  encourage people to vote in a situation that's even a lower 10 out than the record,
*22:10.340- 22:16.300* :  low 42% participation of last parliamentary elections expected. Some polls are saying around
*22:16.300- 22:22.560* :  38 to 40% this time. There are also people noticed changes on the streets, apparently
*22:22.700- 22:28.960* :  the morality police who arrested Masa Amini and led to the protest. They are not that active
*22:28.960- 22:34.940* :  nowadays in the weeks before the election. People see general leniency towards such issues,
*22:35.420- 22:41.540* :  probably not to discourage the voters from voting and implying some changes maybe in the policy
*22:41.540- 22:47.240* :  that will definitely be temporary. Yeah, I mean, how much opposition to the Islamic authorities
*22:47.240- 22:53.620* :  remains and how much is on public display in Iran? Well, the opposition nowadays might not be seen
*22:53.620- 23:00.800* :  in the form of protests on the streets because of the deadly crackdown and the level of control
*23:00.800- 23:06.560* :  that exists by the authorities, but the opposition now shows itself on social media.
*23:07.200- 23:11.400* :  People try to show their criticism and opposition in different ways. And how
*23:11.400- 23:16.500* :  worried are the authorities by the fact that they haven't been able to stamp out this to send
*23:16.500- 23:22.600* :  even if it's no longer seen on the streets? The authorities traditionally certainly used the
*23:22.780- 23:28.100* :  election turnout as a sign of legitimacy and having national support amid all the problems that
*23:28.100- 23:32.420* :  they have with neighboring countries and with the Western powers. And they would like to have a
*23:32.420- 23:37.980* :  high channel and support from the public. But at the same time, they disqualified almost all moderate
*23:37.980- 23:42.340* :  and performance candidates for this election. So some people think that it does matter to them and
*23:42.340- 23:46.440* :  they are worried about the turnout, but it's not the first priority now. The first priority is
*23:47.000- 23:52.860* :  to have their own hardliner and conservative candidates, especially in the assembly of experts,
*23:52.860- 23:58.660* :  which has the power to choose the next supreme leader and the current leader is 84 years old
*23:58.660- 24:04.320* :  and reportedly ill. So the chances are that this assembly of experts will be tasked with choosing
*24:04.320- 24:08.820* :  an ex supreme leader. So that seems to be the priority, but they do worry about the turnout and
*24:08.820- 24:12.200* :  they've been going out of their ways to encourage more will to turn out.
*24:12.680- 24:18.640* :  Sarush Negadari Cuba is asking the World Food Programme to provide milk for its children
*24:18.640- 24:24.280* :  for the first time since the UN agency was founded more than six decades ago. Leanna Bern got
*24:24.280- 24:30.120* :  the details from our reporter Stefania Godsa. Last month, we heard from one of the country's ministers
*24:30.120- 24:35.280* :  saying that it was struggling to secure enough milk for children. There were particular delays
*24:35.280- 24:40.960* :  in deliveries for those aged six months to two years and one vulnerable group was children with
*24:40.960- 24:47.120* :  chronic illnesses who could only receive about half of their normal allotment. Only three of Cuba's
*24:47.120- 24:53.240* :  15 provinces are actually producing enough milk to satisfy demand. But now we've heard from the
*24:53.240- 24:58.660* :  UN's World Food Programme confirming that the Cuban government has approached it for assistance
*24:58.660- 25:04.360* :  in providing milk to children, specifically powdered milk for those under seven. The Cuban
*25:04.360- 25:09.600* :  government is yet to comment. Stefania Milk is a fundamental part of Cuban's Russian
*25:09.600- 25:15.060* :  box system, isn't it? Yes, the Russian book system was introduced after Videl Castro's 1959
*25:15.060- 25:20.800* :  revolution. The idea being that the Cuban government would provide subsidized staples for all,
*25:21.140- 25:26.580* :  but recently it's been hard and harder to fulfill. The country is experiencing a crippling
*25:26.580- 25:32.380* :  economic downturn and its government says that decades of US sanctions have prevented it from
*25:32.380- 25:38.480* :  getting access to the basic foodstuffs Cubans need. So of course the US implemented a trade embargo
*25:38.480- 25:44.480* :  in the late 1950s. It was known there as a blockade and it stops US businesses from conducting
*25:44.480- 25:51.280* :  trade with Cuban interests. Critics though say blaming the sanctions isn't fair and it's
*25:51.280- 25:55.120* :  actually mismanagement of the country's centralized economy. That's the problem.
*25:55.720- 26:01.960* :  Stefania Godsza. Finally, for some people, today is a once-in-a-four-year chance to celebrate.
*26:11.680- 26:18.140* :  Yes, happy birthday to all the Lieplings, people who were born in a leap year on the 29th of February.
*26:18.140- 26:23.380* :  There are only about 5 million in the whole world. They include the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro
*26:23.380- 26:31.120* :  Sanchez, the NASA astronaut Jack Laosma and rapper Jarruh. Susan Forbes is a British Liepling. She is
*26:31.120- 26:36.940* :  48 years old, but has only actually had 12 birthdays. It's quite often a, you know, tell us
*26:36.940- 26:42.100* :  something interesting about yourself and that is my go-to thing. I'm a leap year baby and I'm always
*26:42.100- 26:47.860* :  amazed how many people don't know really what it is. They kind of know it's that weird extra day.
*26:47.860- 26:52.220* :  You get every few years, but everyone's always quite, wow, I've never met a leap year baby before.
*26:52.920- 26:56.620* :  Wow. Why do we have a leap year? Josh Tranta explains.
*26:57.400- 27:03.380* :  Broadly speaking, we all know that a year is 365 days long and every four years we put
*27:03.380- 27:08.620* :  in an extra day, the 29th of February. But if you're anything like me, you didn't know why
*27:08.620- 27:13.580* :  outside of some vague notion that it has something to do with the moon. Turns out I was wrong,
*27:13.580- 27:20.560* :  and it's actually Earth's orbit, which takes precisely 365.242 days to complete.
*27:21.240- 27:25.880* :  Now that fraction of a day might not sound like much, but clearly over time it adds up,
*27:25.880- 27:30.760* :  and it can throw entire seasons out of whack. We've been grappling with this for centuries.
*27:30.760- 27:34.680* :  In ancient Rome, consoles and emperors were fond of putting their stamp on the calendar,
*27:35.140- 27:39.260* :  and Julia Caesar added a leap year to the calendar to try and bring things into alignment with
*27:39.260- 27:43.400* :  the solar year, and maybe to address farmers complaints about snow in July.
*27:44.100- 27:49.320* :  Our current system of leap years dates back to the 1500s when Pope Gregory VIII added that we
*27:49.320- 27:54.620* :  should skip leap years when the year is divisible by four, but confusingly not by four hundred.
*27:55.400- 27:59.920* :  Most of us probably don't need to worry about that, though, as the next skipped leap year will be
*27:59.920- 28:06.420* :  in 2100. Now we do this because there's a little under a quarter of a day extra on the Earth's
*28:06.420- 28:12.740* :  orbit, meaning that those little .008s of a day would add up over time, creating the same problem
*28:12.740- 28:17.540* :  of summer weather in December. Now you might be aware, there are a few traditions around
*28:17.540- 28:21.920* :  leap years, most of them regarding romance. The most well-known is that it's a day when women
*28:21.920- 28:26.620* :  propose to men. If you've been waiting a while, today could be a good day to do it as well.
*28:26.620- 28:31.520* :  British tradition dictates that any man who rejects a woman's proposal today owes her several
*28:31.520- 28:37.240* :  pairs of fine gloves as compensation. The ancient Greeks, though, believed it was bad luck to get married
*28:37.240- 28:42.520* :  on a leap day, so maybe think twice if you're planning on using it as an excuse to only celebrate
*28:42.520- 28:49.860* :  your anniversary every four years. Josh Trenton. And that is all from us for now, but there'll be a new
*28:49.860- 28:55.520* :  addition of the global news podcast very soon. This one was mixed by Callum McLean and produced by Oliver
*28:55.520- 29:00.140* :  Burrow, our editors, Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
*29:08.820- 29:12.660* :  Do you ever feel like money is just flying out of your account and you have no idea where it's going?
*29:12.660- 29:18.160* :  Well, I know. It's all of those subscriptions. I used rocket money to help me find out what
*29:18.160- 29:22.560* :  subscriptions I'm actually spending money on, and I had them cancel the ones I didn't want anymore.
*29:22.560- 29:27.200* :  Rocket money is a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions,
*29:27.200- 29:32.780* :  monitors your spending, and helps lower your bills. Rocket money has over five million users and
*29:32.780- 29:39.300* :  has helped save its members an average of $720 a year with over $500 million in cancel subscriptions.
