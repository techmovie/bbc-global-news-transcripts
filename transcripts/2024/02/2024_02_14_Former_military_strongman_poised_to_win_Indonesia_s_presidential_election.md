*00:00.060- 00:04.020* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:04.020- 00:06.580* :  with reports and analysis from across the world,
*00:06.580- 00:08.740* :  the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.580* :  BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:32.740- 00:36.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:39.120- 00:44.340* :  I'm Nigel Adely and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday, February the 14th,
*00:44.640- 00:49.300* :  these are our main stories. Early unofficial results from Indonesia's
*00:49.300- 00:53.300* :  presidential election suggest the Defence Minister and former General
*00:53.300- 00:56.980* :  Prabowo Subianto is on course to secure victory.
*00:57.600- 01:01.380* :  Ukraine's military says it's destroyed a Russian warship in the Black Sea
*01:01.940- 01:06.200* :  and for a second day, Indian police have used tear gas and water cannon
*01:06.200- 01:09.940* :  to stop protesting farmers from marching on the capital, Delhi.
*01:12.740- 01:16.680* :  Also in this podcast, Notre Dame's spire rises from the ashes,
*01:17.300- 01:22.000* :  nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. We hear what it's like to be trapped in Raffa
*01:22.320- 01:24.860* :  amid the looming threat of an Israeli ground attack.
*01:25.420- 01:31.740* :  And to the long, long competition and have neck ache at this moment,
*01:31.740- 01:35.080* :  so I think I need, I need to, I need some rest.
*01:35.840- 01:39.400* :  Ivory Coast's victorious manager looked forward to a well-earned rest
*01:39.840- 01:41.700* :  after winning the Africa Cup of Nations.
*01:45.060- 01:49.660* :  We start in Indonesia where early polling samples after today's election
*01:49.660- 01:53.300* :  give a clear lead to the Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto
*01:53.680- 01:56.440* :  who's hoping to win the presidency on the first round.
*01:56.460- 02:01.120* :  Four results aren't due until next month, but the state approves a so-called
*02:01.120- 02:06.060* :  quick count beforehand. Indonesia's outgoing president, Yoko Widodo,
*02:06.680- 02:10.840* :  has been criticized for giving undue support to Mr Prabowo's campaign,
*02:10.840- 02:14.540* :  which featured Mr Widodo's son as his running mate.
*02:15.060- 02:18.820* :  After casting his ballot, the outgoing president spoke to reporters.
*02:21.500- 02:23.700* :  This is a celebration of democracy.
*02:24.600- 02:27.220* :  We hope it will be the people's celebration as well,
*02:27.800- 02:33.360* :  and I hope it will go safely, honestly, directly, free and confidential,
*02:33.900- 02:36.700* :  and be followed by all Indonesian people with joy,
*02:37.400- 02:41.260* :  because this is the people's party, a party of democracy.
*02:42.720- 02:47.160* :  Our correspondent in Jakarta is Jonathan Head. He's been following the results.
*02:47.180- 02:50.940* :  Well, they do these quick counts, which are a bit like exit polls,
*02:51.020- 02:54.920* :  and a lot of different polling groups do them. They are known to be pretty accurate.
*02:55.580- 02:59.220* :  What they're telling us is that Prabowo Subianto, the Defence Minister,
*02:59.240- 03:03.400* :  the most controversial candidate by far, who's been ahead for months now,
*03:03.400- 03:08.160* :  has probably done a good deal better even than they predicted before the election.
*03:08.160- 03:12.460* :  All of the exit polls suggest he's easily exceeded the 50% threshold
*03:12.460- 03:19.740* :  that will give him an outright win over his two rivals in this first round and make him president.
*03:19.740- 03:26.220* :  So, obviously, I'm down at the place where his supporters have gathered.
*03:26.220- 03:29.320* :  He's supposed to arrive here sometime over the next hour,
*03:29.780- 03:32.640* :  and I imagine he will claim victory, and they will all celebrate.
*03:32.680- 03:34.580* :  There's a very celebratory mood here anyway.
*03:35.120- 03:38.420* :  A very despondent one in the counts of his rivals.
*03:38.500- 03:42.020* :  It had been expected to be a much closer race between the three of them.
*03:42.520- 03:48.880* :  But, Prabowo Subianto simply built up a momentum and lead in vote counting
*03:49.140- 03:50.800* :  that has left the others far behind.
*03:51.780- 03:54.340* :  And there have been some allegations of election fraud as well.
*03:56.140- 03:59.960* :  Well, one of the camps, one of the camps that has Gantza Pranova,
*03:59.960- 04:03.180* :  has alleged they have evidence of what they're calling massive electoral fraud.
*04:04.120- 04:09.180* :  We've got no indications to whether there are real grounds for that at this stage or not.
*04:09.180- 04:14.500* :  The real complaints of Prabowo's rivals, particularly Gantza's camp.
*04:14.700- 04:20.200* :  Remember, the real complaint relates to President Jokowi's support of Prabowo,
*04:20.480- 04:23.560* :  not just that he's lent his immense popularity to him,
*04:24.220- 04:28.980* :  but also that he managed to get an extremely controversial constitutional court ruling
*04:28.980- 04:31.740* :  that allowed his son to run as Prabowo's running mate,
*04:31.740- 04:33.720* :  even though he's under the minimum age.
*04:34.120- 04:36.580* :  And that's alarmed and outraged. A lot of people,
*04:38.100- 04:42.520* :  President Jokowi used to be with the other camp, the camp of what's now the third ranking
*04:42.520- 04:46.900* :  candidate, Gantza. So there's a lot of dismay about the way he switched sides of the last minute.
*04:47.320- 04:53.640* :  And that he's back to candidate who is so controversial, a fiery, outspoken man with a record of
*04:53.680- 04:58.100* :  very anti-democratic comments and a spotty human rights record.
*04:58.100- 05:01.980* :  For a lot of Indonesians, that makes this a very worrying result indeed.
*05:01.980- 05:06.800* :  Jonathan Head. More than a million people are sheltering in Raffa
*05:07.140- 05:09.880* :  after fleeing the fighting in Israel's war with Hamas,
*05:10.460- 05:13.540* :  and the UN humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffis
*05:13.980- 05:18.740* :  has said an Israeli ground offensive and southern Gaza could lead to a slaughter.
*05:19.440- 05:22.640* :  Stefan Duyarech, a spokesman for the Secretary General,
*05:23.080- 05:26.940* :  told us the UN would not participate in any forced evacuation.
*05:27.780- 05:32.280* :  Our focus is on the protection of those civilians in Gaza,
*05:32.980- 05:37.200* :  and ensuring that no one is forcibly displaced.
*05:37.200- 05:42.860* :  And I can tell you clearly that the United Nations will not be party to any forced displacement
*05:42.860- 05:50.080* :  of people. You have now over a million human beings who are crammed into Raffa
*05:50.160- 05:54.160* :  under extremely challenging situation,
*05:54.760- 05:57.140* :  including with fighting going on around them.
*05:57.440- 06:02.800* :  Any military operation in Raffa would be catastrophic to say the least.
*06:03.080- 06:06.760* :  Meanwhile, there are reports the Israeli military has ordered Palestinians
*06:06.760- 06:12.020* :  to evacuate the NASA hospital in Khan Unis in the south of the Gaza Strip.
*06:12.500- 06:14.980* :  Our correspondent, Barbara Plattascha in Jerusalem,
*06:15.520- 06:18.460* :  has this assessment of the latest warnings from the UN.
*06:19.180- 06:24.520* :  I would say that it reflects unprecedented concern from UN agencies, aid agencies,
*06:24.520- 06:29.800* :  about the situation in Raffa, which is already very difficult for the people there,
*06:29.800- 06:31.840* :  and for the aid people trying to help them.
*06:32.080- 06:38.040* :  But then you have the Israeli announcement that it plans to expand its war into the city to send
*06:38.040- 06:41.380* :  ground forces into finish its conflict with Hamas.
*06:41.840- 06:44.800* :  So the Israelis have said they would have an evacuation plan,
*06:44.800- 06:50.240* :  but basically I think the UN is saying that's not really possible under the circumstances.
*06:50.240- 06:54.200* :  What Mr. Griffiths, the top humanitarian official at the UN,
*06:54.200- 06:58.140* :  said military operations in Raffa could lead to a slaughter in Gaza.
*06:58.140- 07:04.940* :  He said the already fragile humanitarian operation could be a death's door if that happened.
*07:04.940- 07:08.420* :  And he basically said it's already not working, it's already not, it's in tatters.
*07:08.420- 07:12.000* :  We lack the safety guarantees, the aid supplies, and the staff capacity
*07:12.000- 07:17.360* :  to keep this operation afloat that Israel should heed the warnings about such an operation.
*07:17.440- 07:19.740* :  And then he ended by saying history will not be kind.
*07:20.800- 07:27.160* :  So it's a very stark warning, and it reflects how concerned UN aid agencies are about the situation.
*07:27.660- 07:31.900* :  The Israelis have not given details of what they say would be an evacuation plan for the
*07:32.240- 07:34.640* :  more than one million civilians who've taken refuge there.
*07:34.640- 07:38.700* :  And the UN has spokesperson has said they haven't seen a plan,
*07:39.280- 07:42.220* :  but given how they're struggling to meet the situation as it is,
*07:42.680- 07:46.440* :  the inadequate water, shelter, food for the people there,
*07:46.900- 07:50.680* :  they're just not in a position to create a whole nother location for them.
*07:50.680- 07:55.600* :  They have responded very, very strongly against this proposed military incursion.
*07:55.940- 07:59.500* :  And of course there were talks in Cairo yesterday amount of possible cease fire,
*07:59.500- 08:01.140* :  but they appear to have ended in deadlock.
*08:01.440- 08:02.520* :  There were high-level talks.
*08:02.520- 08:05.420* :  They involved the intelligence chiefs of Egypt,
*08:06.340- 08:09.180* :  United States, and Israel, and the Prime Minister of Qatar.
*08:09.420- 08:14.300* :  And these four had previously drafted a framework for a ceasefire proposal
*08:15.080- 08:18.640* :  that didn't go very far because Hamas made some amendments to it,
*08:18.660- 08:20.840* :  and the Israel strongly rejected its conditions.
*08:21.580- 08:23.500* :  So this is this first meeting since that.
*08:24.080- 08:25.280* :  And there wasn't a breakthrough.
*08:25.940- 08:26.980* :  The gaps are still wide.
*08:26.980- 08:32.200* :  What we understand from some reports is that the main sticking point is the ratio of Israeli
*08:32.200- 08:36.680* :  hostages that would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
*08:36.680- 08:42.120* :  That would be involving a six-week pause or ceasefire in order to do that,
*08:42.120- 08:43.600* :  and also to get aid into Gaza.
*08:44.260- 08:45.320* :  So they are still continuing.
*08:45.320- 08:48.680* :  And I think the hope now is, amongst other things,
*08:48.680- 08:53.960* :  that this might head off or postpone any kind of Israeli offensive into Rafa.
*09:01.900- 09:07.720* :  To forget, the daily reality of life facing thousands of civilians now trapped in Rafa.
*09:08.240- 09:11.240* :  Victoria Uon Kunda has been talking to one of them,
*09:11.580- 09:15.000* :  Deena, who has been displaced five times since October,
*09:15.520- 09:18.580* :  and has fled to Rafa from her home in the north of the Gaza Strip.
*09:19.220- 09:22.560* :  I get displaced five times. This is my fifth.
*09:22.760- 09:26.800* :  The past two days was very devastating and dreadful.
*09:26.960- 09:29.120* :  Rafa is getting intensive,
*09:29.620- 09:32.480* :  and people are thinking about displacing,
*09:32.480- 09:34.680* :  and everyone is trying to find a place.
*09:34.680- 09:38.600* :  A lot of people that I know and myself, we don't have another place to go.
*09:38.980- 09:40.540* :  We are originally from the north.
*09:40.980- 09:45.000* :  We don't have a lot of choices in the south,
*09:45.260- 09:49.980* :  and Rafa was our last choice, and now it's very bad.
*09:50.280- 09:54.720* :  How does that feel like being displaced fifth time you say you have been?
*09:55.080- 09:57.640* :  Now you are in Rafa, and it's getting intensive.
*09:57.640- 10:02.000* :  You are describing how does it feel being in such a situation?
*10:02.460- 10:04.020* :  I think it's very, very bad.
*10:04.020- 10:08.820* :  Like, displacing was this is the first time I am displaced in an attack on Gaza,
*10:09.140- 10:10.660* :  and this is the most difficult thing.
*10:10.660- 10:13.300* :  When I get displaced the first time from the north,
*10:13.660- 10:15.260* :  I lift everything in my house.
*10:15.600- 10:16.540* :  I didn't take anything.
*10:17.140- 10:18.280* :  We just run away fast.
*10:18.280- 10:22.080* :  We get on the car and we switch on the car and we ran away,
*10:22.080- 10:23.140* :  and we lift everything.
*10:23.560- 10:25.380* :  It is very bad to feel displaced.
*10:26.360- 10:28.320* :  Yeah, I mean, I know all about feeling displaced.
*10:28.320- 10:31.940* :  I went through similar things with a warp,
*10:31.940- 10:34.680* :  back in the 90s from my own home country, Randa,
*10:34.680- 10:36.320* :  but you say you've lost your home.
*10:36.760- 10:38.240* :  Have you lost any family members?
*10:38.980- 10:39.660* :  Yes, I do.
*10:39.940- 10:42.400* :  I lost my brother-in-law and my nephew.
*10:42.760- 10:44.360* :  I'm so sorry for your loss, Zina.
*10:45.320- 10:47.640* :  Being there and the intensive environment,
*10:47.640- 10:51.400* :  you know, so the shops I imagine, they've been closed for months,
*10:51.400- 10:54.860* :  and we keep hearing about medication and medicine
*10:54.860- 10:57.900* :  and hospitals being shut down because there is nothing
*10:57.900- 10:58.980* :  that is coming in.
*10:59.360- 11:00.860* :  What is like daily life for you?
*11:01.520- 11:02.060* :  That's true.
*11:02.060- 11:04.080* :  Shops and bakeries are closed.
*11:04.460- 11:05.660* :  Even if you have money,
*11:05.660- 11:07.260* :  you wouldn't find anything to buy.
*11:07.520- 11:10.320* :  The medication shortage is very problematic, too,
*11:10.320- 11:12.640* :  because I am an asthma patient.
*11:12.640- 11:15.100* :  I caught a respiratory virus.
*11:15.100- 11:16.860* :  They couldn't find a cough syrup,
*11:17.200- 11:18.640* :  and I started to cough a blood.
*11:18.640- 11:22.220* :  And we tried everywhere and tried to talk to everyone.
*11:22.220- 11:24.640* :  They said, truly, there is no medication.
*11:24.720- 11:27.780* :  You wouldn't find it because it doesn't interest since four months.
*11:27.920- 11:30.360* :  I have lived in Gaza for 27 years.
*11:30.360- 11:33.600* :  It's like you see a place for 27 years,
*11:33.600- 11:34.660* :  but you don't know it anymore.
*11:35.600- 11:38.560* :  Dina talking to Victoria, Uon Kunda.
*11:39.960- 11:42.200* :  It's been almost five years since the spire
*11:42.200- 11:44.620* :  of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris collapsed
*11:44.620- 11:46.440* :  during the devastating fire.
*11:47.060- 11:48.740* :  Since then, it's been hidden from view,
*11:49.220- 11:50.280* :  covered in scaffolding,
*11:50.600- 11:52.420* :  while restoration work was undertaken.
*11:53.120- 11:55.640* :  Now, parts of the spine are visible once again.
*11:56.240- 11:57.820* :  Huesco Field reports from Paris.
*11:59.660- 12:02.660* :  It's not the end, but maybe it's the beginning of the end.
*12:02.660- 12:05.300* :  For years, Parisians have grown accustomed to the cranes
*12:05.300- 12:07.540* :  and the scaffolding creeping ever higher
*12:07.860- 12:09.100* :  over the shell of Notre Dame.
*12:09.420- 12:11.000* :  Now, the process has reversed,
*12:11.460- 12:14.840* :  and the scaffolding is slowly painstakingly coming down.
*12:15.220- 12:17.300* :  Revealing today, like a receding tide,
*12:17.300- 12:19.840* :  just the very pinnacle of the new spire,
*12:19.840- 12:21.160* :  surmounted by a cross,
*12:21.480- 12:23.900* :  and on top of that, a statuate of a golden cock,
*12:23.900- 12:26.440* :  just like the one that disappeared in the blaze.
*12:26.740- 12:28.620* :  For Philippe Just, president of the Notre Dame
*12:28.620- 12:30.960* :  renovation agency, it's a powerful moment.
*12:31.240- 12:32.460* :  The volume, the burst yours.
*12:32.460- 12:34.880* :  People are impatient to see the cathedral rebuilt,
*12:35.320- 12:36.760* :  and this impatience is increasing
*12:36.760- 12:38.420* :  as we get closer to the opening.
*12:39.100- 12:41.920* :  The fall of the spire was the most dramatic moment of the fire,
*12:42.240- 12:44.220* :  so to see the spire finally rebuilt,
*12:44.220- 12:45.960* :  it's like the healing of a wound.
*12:46.340- 12:48.000* :  The spire is made from oak beams
*12:48.020- 12:50.900* :  and the last task of the craftsmen and women on the scaffolding
*12:51.080- 12:52.860* :  is cladding the wood in lead,
*12:52.860- 12:56.300* :  the soft metal, malleable enough to show the art
*12:56.300- 12:57.920* :  that's gone into the carpentry.
*12:58.340- 13:00.100* :  After this, the rest of the wooden roof,
*13:00.100- 13:01.580* :  the forest, as it's known in French,
*13:01.900- 13:02.740* :  will need to be covered,
*13:03.020- 13:05.060* :  and there are new safety mechanisms to be installed
*13:05.060- 13:07.920* :  like water sprayers to cut the risk of another fire.
*13:08.160- 13:10.680* :  After the congregation, they gave themselves five years
*13:10.680- 13:12.320* :  to get the restoration completed.
*13:12.620- 13:13.540* :  It seemed ambitious,
*13:13.540- 13:16.540* :  but it looks like they might come in on time.
*13:17.220- 13:18.420* :  Husego filled in Paris.
*13:21.180- 13:21.780* :  Still to come.
*13:22.060- 13:23.940* :  What they're going to do is they're going to have an entirely
*13:23.940- 13:27.500* :  performative impeachment so that they can go into the election,
*13:27.500- 13:29.980* :  saying immigration is in terrible shape,
*13:30.180- 13:32.220* :  and we impeach the administration official
*13:32.220- 13:34.180* :  who is responsible for that policy.
*13:34.700- 13:36.780* :  And historic day for the U.S. Congress.
*13:37.480- 13:38.560* :  But will it make any difference?
*13:39.240- 13:41.200* :  U.S.
*13:46.460- 13:48.760* :  Ukrainian naval drones and military forces
*13:48.760- 13:51.260* :  have attacked and sunk a Russian warship,
*13:51.640- 13:54.220* :  which was anchored off the occupied Crimean peninsula.
*13:54.220- 13:57.280* :  The Cesar Kunikoff, a large landing ship,
*13:57.700- 13:59.520* :  was near the resort town of Alebka
*13:59.880- 14:01.760* :  in Ukraine's territorial waters.
*14:02.440- 14:04.820* :  It's the latest in a series of successful attacks
*14:04.820- 14:05.860* :  on the Russian fleet.
*14:06.540- 14:09.400* :  Speaking ahead of a NATO defense minister meeting in Brussels,
*14:09.400- 14:12.680* :  Jens Stoltenberg praised the Ukrainian military.
*14:13.340- 14:16.580* :  And this is a great achievement, a great victory for the Ukrainians.
*14:16.860- 14:20.660* :  The fact that they've been able to push away the Russian Black Sea fleet
*14:21.100- 14:22.060* :  and open a corridor.
*14:22.640- 14:24.560* :  So they now are able to export grain
*14:24.560- 14:26.580* :  and other commodities to the world market.
*14:27.180- 14:30.080* :  A few believe this was possible just a few months ago.
*14:30.480- 14:33.560* :  A correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse told us more.
*14:34.160- 14:35.980* :  We have a claim from Ukraine's military
*14:36.460- 14:39.360* :  that the Cesar Kunikoff was destroyed
*14:39.360- 14:42.760* :  by marine drones packed with explosives,
*14:42.760- 14:45.380* :  which, as you say, have they've used a great effect.
*14:45.420- 14:48.000* :  They're manufactured mostly in Ukraine.
*14:48.000- 14:51.460* :  And I think the use of those along with long-range missiles
*14:51.460- 14:55.580* :  has enabled Ukraine to degrade Russia's navy significantly.
*14:55.580- 14:59.080* :  Now there is footage that which has also been released
*14:59.780- 15:02.240* :  by the armed forces, which appears to show
*15:02.700- 15:09.960* :  the landing ship being hit by an on-board camera on the marine drone.
*15:10.040- 15:13.160* :  There is a column of black smoke, which could be seen
*15:13.720- 15:16.500* :  out on the horizon of the black sea.
*15:16.840- 15:19.540* :  Nothing yet from the Russian-installed officials there,
*15:19.540- 15:23.140* :  but it suggests that it has lost another landing vessel
*15:23.140- 15:25.700* :  the second in almost as many months.
*15:25.700- 15:30.260* :  And this is significant because for Russian forces in the south of Ukraine,
*15:30.260- 15:33.360* :  it is by sea, which is the most efficient way
*15:33.960- 15:37.420* :  for it to shift soldiers and equipment.
*15:37.420- 15:42.660* :  This landing ship in question could carry up to 300 troops.
*15:42.660- 15:45.620* :  It could carry 12 armored vehicles.
*15:45.840- 15:49.740* :  And so the destruction of a fourth landing ship of this size
*15:50.340- 15:53.340* :  severely hamper Russia's ability to manoeuvre
*15:53.340- 15:54.900* :  and supply troops in the south.
*15:55.260- 15:57.180* :  And this is part of Ukraine playing a longer games.
*15:57.280- 16:00.100* :  It tries to cut off the occupied Crimean Peninsula,
*16:00.100- 16:02.940* :  which Russia has held on to since 2014.
*16:03.240- 16:06.900* :  Unfortunately for Kiev, it is a different story on the front lines
*16:06.900- 16:10.000* :  where generals are seriously considering retreating
*16:10.000- 16:13.560* :  in some areas as Russian land forces continue to launch endless attacks.
*16:14.320- 16:18.240* :  And there have been reports on Reuters that Vladimir Putin was proposing a ceasefire
*16:18.240- 16:20.360* :  to the U.S. via intermediaries.
*16:20.360- 16:21.940* :  That's been denied by the Kremlin.
*16:21.940- 16:24.120* :  How would the Kiev view that?
*16:25.120- 16:27.560* :  Well, I think Kiev would make the point it always has done,
*16:27.900- 16:31.820* :  which is a ceasefire isn't even worth the paper it is written on.
*16:31.820- 16:36.160* :  I think Kiev points to recent history of the last quarter of a century,
*16:36.160- 16:39.760* :  where you have Russia at one point saying it would recognize Ukraine's borders
*16:39.760- 16:41.260* :  with the collapse of the Soviet Union,
*16:41.260- 16:43.620* :  with the agreement that it would serve Kiev
*16:43.620- 16:45.060* :  with surrender it's nuclear arsenal,
*16:45.060- 16:48.460* :  with the ceasefires in the outbreak of the war in 2014,
*16:48.460- 16:50.920* :  which Russia has always gone back on.
*16:51.040- 16:52.680* :  I think what Kiev is really worried about
*16:52.680- 16:55.640* :  is if it was to come under mounting pressure from the West
*16:56.120- 16:59.980* :  to accept some kind of ceasefire or a concession on territory,
*17:00.540- 17:02.940* :  Russia, Vladimir Putin will launch an attack
*17:03.500- 17:04.920* :  of a greater scale down the line,
*17:04.980- 17:06.440* :  because it is Kiev and the whole of Ukraine,
*17:06.440- 17:09.940* :  which he has always wanted and I can't see that changing anytime soon.
*17:10.360- 17:11.320* :  James Waterhouse
*17:11.920- 17:14.300* :  And Ukraine is the main topic on the agenda
*17:14.300- 17:16.440* :  at that NATO defense minister's meeting.
*17:16.460- 17:22.260* :  It's taking place a day after the U.S. Senate passed a $95 billion aid package.
*17:22.900- 17:24.440* :  Much of that will go to Ukraine.
*17:25.140- 17:26.420* :  But they also have in their minds
*17:26.420- 17:28.680* :  Donald Trump's comments at the weekend
*17:28.700- 17:32.480* :  in which he said he'd encourage Russia to attack NATO countries
*17:32.480- 17:35.080* :  who are not investing enough in defense.
*17:35.860- 17:37.680* :  At a news conference ahead of that meeting,
*17:37.680- 17:41.400* :  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed
*17:41.400- 17:46.180* :  a majority of NATO members would hit the 2% target in defense spending.
*17:46.760- 17:52.960* :  This year I expect 18 allies to spend 2% of the GDP on defense.
*17:54.440- 17:56.380* :  That is another record number.
*17:57.800- 18:00.960* :  And a six-fold increase from 2014
*18:01.640- 18:04.260* :  when only three allies met the target.
*18:06.020- 18:09.320* :  However, some allies still have a way to go,
*18:10.280- 18:12.980* :  because we agreed at the beginning of the summit
*18:13.560- 18:16.480* :  that all allies should invest 2%,
*18:17.160- 18:19.300* :  and that 2% is a minimum.
*18:20.020- 18:22.840* :  Our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel is in Brussels.
*18:22.860- 18:26.000* :  I asked him how much of Jens Stoltenberg's comments
*18:26.000- 18:28.340* :  were down to what Donald Trump had said.
*18:28.960- 18:31.620* :  Jens Stoltenberg was very careful not to say anything
*18:31.620- 18:33.320* :  that antagonized Donald Trump,
*18:33.380- 18:35.460* :  because people here know that it is a possibility
*18:36.100- 18:37.680* :  that he may once again be president.
*18:37.800- 18:40.760* :  I mean, it was very difficult when they were working with him when he was president,
*18:40.820- 18:44.200* :  and Jens Stoltenberg trod a very careful path.
*18:44.240- 18:46.560* :  He didn't mention Donald Trump today by name,
*18:46.560- 18:49.560* :  but the reality is that more countries are spending
*18:50.220- 18:52.300* :  more on their defense in NATO,
*18:52.860- 18:54.980* :  not because of Donald Trump's cajoling,
*18:55.500- 18:58.760* :  but because of what Vladimir Putin has done in Ukraine.
*18:58.760- 19:02.700* :  And if you look at the figures when they set the 2% figure,
*19:03.040- 19:06.880* :  meeting 2% of GDP spent on defense in 2014,
*19:06.920- 19:10.440* :  that was when Vladimir Putin essentially invaded Crimea.
*19:11.360- 19:13.000* :  And now, at the end of this year,
*19:13.000- 19:16.540* :  there will be 18 of the 31 members so far of NATO
*19:17.080- 19:19.440* :  who will probably meet that 2% goal.
*19:19.620- 19:21.020* :  So there has been a dramatic change,
*19:21.420- 19:24.320* :  and that dramatic change is down to Vladimir Putin,
*19:24.760- 19:25.740* :  rather than Donald Trump.
*19:25.840- 19:30.000* :  Though some countries still need to be chivvyed up to spend 2%,
*19:30.000- 19:33.800* :  because as I said, it's 18 of 31, not all of the 31.
*19:34.240- 19:35.520* :  And is this money enough?
*19:36.740- 19:39.080* :  Well, it depends what you mean, is it enough for what?
*19:39.080- 19:42.600* :  I mean, the cause of concern of lots of countries
*19:42.600- 19:44.660* :  on Russia's borders, NATO countries,
*19:45.220- 19:46.680* :  like the Baltic states, like Poland,
*19:47.220- 19:48.540* :  and they are the ones that have increased
*19:48.540- 19:50.500* :  if defense spending massively,
*19:50.500- 19:53.120* :  is that they could be next theoretically,
*19:53.200- 19:55.820* :  if President Putin got his way in Ukraine.
*19:56.400- 19:58.100* :  So in terms of is it enough?
*19:58.600- 20:01.080* :  I mean, you look at NATO's defense spending overall
*20:01.080- 20:03.320* :  against Russia's, including all the countries,
*20:03.320- 20:05.840* :  and assuming that all NATO countries would respond
*20:05.840- 20:08.040* :  if a NATO member was attacked,
*20:08.040- 20:11.200* :  then yes, NATO does spend more on defense than Russia,
*20:11.500- 20:14.340* :  and also gets probably more advanced military equipment,
*20:14.480- 20:16.040* :  which they've been giving to Ukraine,
*20:16.040- 20:18.620* :  and clearly today we've seen had some success.
*20:18.620- 20:23.240* :  For example, we're seeing the Ukrainians using deep strikes
*20:24.080- 20:26.200* :  inside Russian-held territory inside Ukraine,
*20:26.200- 20:28.040* :  like in the Black Sea, like in Crimea,
*20:28.840- 20:30.320* :  and destroying Russian warships.
*20:30.320- 20:34.760* :  So the belief here is that they are in a much better place here now
*20:34.760- 20:36.200* :  than they were in 2014
*20:37.040- 20:39.640* :  in providing that collective defense for their allies
*20:40.420- 20:41.720* :  against any Russian threat.
*20:42.480- 20:46.360* :  Jonathan Beal, for only the second time in U.S. history,
*20:46.360- 20:49.040* :  the House of Representatives has impeached
*20:49.320- 20:51.380* :  a sitting member of the president's cabinet.
*20:52.020- 20:55.300* :  Republicans have been targeting the Homeland Security Secretary,
*20:55.300- 20:58.580* :  Alejandro Mayorkas, saying he didn't do enough
*20:58.580- 21:00.560* :  to enforce the immigration laws,
*21:01.040- 21:03.360* :  which resulted in a record number of migrants
*21:03.860- 21:05.120* :  crossing the Mexican border,
*21:05.700- 21:10.080* :  more than six million have entered the country illegally since 2021,
*21:10.140- 21:14.580* :  and the vote was won by the Narrowist margin, one vote.
*21:15.320- 21:18.440* :  Professor Frank Bowman teaches at the Missouri School of Law.
*21:18.980- 21:21.700* :  He testified to the impeachment panel back in January
*21:21.700- 21:24.900* :  and warned them the Secretary hadn't actually committed
*21:25.300- 21:26.260* :  an impeachable offense,
*21:26.260- 21:29.880* :  and he's been telling Luke Jones what he makes of the House's move.
*21:30.620- 21:33.980* :  In the United States, impeachment is a constitutional tool,
*21:34.180- 21:38.440* :  which is among the gravest and really most solemn constitutional processes,
*21:38.440- 21:41.980* :  and to impeach someone, whether it's a president or a cabinet officer,
*21:42.340- 21:46.120* :  one must show treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,
*21:46.340- 21:48.880* :  and that bar plainly has not been met.
*21:49.440- 21:51.880* :  And the understanding is that even though this has passed in the
*21:51.880- 21:57.340* :  in the lower house, 214 to 213, so by a whisker,
*21:57.820- 22:00.600* :  it will fail in the in the upper chamber that the Senate.
*22:00.600- 22:01.700* :  And why is that?
*22:01.960- 22:06.120* :  First reason, of course, is that the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority
*22:06.120- 22:08.180* :  in the Senate for there to be a conviction,
*22:08.180- 22:10.940* :  which would require 67 of 100 votes.
*22:10.940- 22:14.920* :  And of course, the Democrats hold a majority, 51, 49.
*22:14.940- 22:19.320* :  None of them will vote for this, and I think fairly significant number of Republicans will not.
*22:19.860- 22:26.940* :  So the chances of this passing or conviction being achieved by a majority of 67 is next to zero.
*22:27.240- 22:29.180* :  So this is just a bit of face, do you think, man? Essentially.
*22:29.700- 22:32.780* :  Well, exactly. And I think we have to understand what's going on here.
*22:32.780- 22:35.760* :  You have to understand what is happening, not only with this impeachment,
*22:35.760- 22:40.980* :  but with substantive legislation on immigration that was actually put together
*22:40.980- 22:45.180* :  by a bipartisan negotiating group not too long ago last week or so.
*22:45.380- 22:48.820* :  That actually addresses real serious immigration problems.
*22:48.820- 22:50.680* :  We have in the United States it's southern border.
*22:50.860- 22:53.060* :  And instead, what they're going to do is they're going to have an entirely
*22:53.060- 22:56.120* :  performative impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas
*22:56.620- 22:59.420* :  so that they can go into the election saying,
*22:59.420- 23:01.680* :  all immigration is in terrible shape.
*23:01.680- 23:06.480* :  And we impeach the administration official who was responsible for that policy.
*23:06.480- 23:11.120* :  Carefully not saying that they refused to actually do anything substantive about it themselves.
*23:11.840- 23:14.280* :  Around the time of the impeachment of Donald Trump,
*23:14.400- 23:19.140* :  that there was lots of concern from commentators that this would become the new normal,
*23:19.140- 23:21.180* :  that there would be a tit for tat impeachment.
*23:21.180- 23:25.700* :  And Republicans would always try to impeach Democrats and the other way round.
*23:26.400- 23:28.520* :  Are we seeing that playing out now?
*23:28.780- 23:31.380* :  It is now a political tool more than it ever was.
*23:32.020- 23:34.880* :  I think with the Mayorkas impeachment, that is what we're saying.
*23:34.960- 23:39.000* :  I want to be clear, however, that I do not think that either of the Trump
*23:39.000- 23:43.160* :  impeachments were political in the narrowly partisan sense.
*23:43.180- 23:46.100* :  He was impeached because he committed impeachable offenses.
*23:46.140- 23:51.440* :  He did serious things that were, you know, contrary to the American Constitution order.
*23:51.940- 23:54.580* :  Professor Frank Bowman talking to Luke Jones.
*23:55.500- 23:59.540* :  South Korean officials have confirmed to the BBC that hackers in the North
*23:59.540- 24:04.680* :  have managed to break into the personal emails of a member of the South Korean President's team.
*24:04.680- 24:10.320* :  The breach occurred during the run-up to President Yun Suk-Yul's state visits of the UK last November.
*24:10.900- 24:12.420* :  Jim McKenzie reports from Seoul.
*24:13.160- 24:18.160* :  The North Korean hacker was reportedly able to access the President's schedule for his state
*24:18.160- 24:22.080* :  visit in November, as well as emails sent by the President himself.
*24:22.080- 24:27.040* :  The government aid had been using his personal email account to plan the trip to London,
*24:27.040- 24:32.500* :  during which President Yun met King Charles and Queen Camilla, as well as the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
*24:32.500- 24:36.280* :  The President's office here has confirmed to us that the hack took place,
*24:36.280- 24:38.860* :  but it wouldn't detail what information was stolen.
*24:38.860- 24:44.960* :  It said its security hadn't been breached and blamed the careless actions of one of its employees.
*24:45.640- 24:51.820* :  Pyongyang is increasingly using cyberhacking to steal both large amounts of money to fund the regime,
*24:52.520- 24:54.300* :  as well as sensitive state secrets.
*25:25.860- 25:30.800* :  We will not leave until our demands are met, because our trust has been betrayed once before by the
*25:30.800- 25:38.480* :  government. There are about 200 to 250 groups of farmers supporting us. Wait and watch. This protest
*25:38.480- 25:41.700* :  will be on a much larger scale than the last one.
*25:47.560- 25:51.220* :  There are tens of thousands of farmers, but still we have not seen the level of
*25:51.220- 25:59.820* :  participation what we witnessed in 2020 and 2021. But the intensity is quite high at this moment,
*25:59.820- 26:04.880* :  because farmers, as you said, they tried to break through this barrier set up by police,
*26:04.880- 26:10.300* :  like the cement blocks, barrigades and spikes, but they were stopped by security forces
*26:11.280- 26:18.020* :  at one of the borders, about 200 kilometers north of Delhi. We saw the drones,
*26:18.020- 26:23.360* :  but a footage showed that how drones were dropping the tear gas canisters. Now the farmers were
*26:23.360- 26:30.360* :  countering that by flying kites, and the blades of the drones can get entangled in the rope of
*26:30.360- 26:35.680* :  this kite. So that was a big amusement how they were trying to chase the police drones.
*26:36.140- 26:40.940* :  In the meantime, the government has asked the farmers to come for talks, and then they say we will
*26:40.940- 26:47.400* :  look into your demands. But one of the ministers also made it very clear that it is not possible to
*26:47.400- 26:52.300* :  accommodate all the demands, particularly I showed flow prices, like giving them a minimum
*26:52.300- 26:57.460* :  guaranteed price because they have to consult all the stakeholders. And how many farmers do you
*26:57.460- 27:02.260* :  believe will be in this for the long haul? They will carry on for as long as it takes. The pictures
*27:02.260- 27:07.240* :  show that there are hundreds of tractors with the trailers where the farmers have come well prepared
*27:07.240- 27:14.020* :  with food and tent material and also prepared for the rains. So they say that they are in for a
*27:14.020- 27:19.300* :  long haul, even for about six months of food they have packed. And that is why they are near the
*27:19.300- 27:23.900* :  border. And in fact, they are making food and distributing to other people. Now what we have to
*27:23.900- 27:29.200* :  see is whether other farmers unions are joining. Now already there are some groups which say that
*27:29.200- 27:36.260* :  they are going to do a to intensify their protest against this police action by stopping rail
*27:36.260- 27:41.760* :  traffic for about four hours in the state of Punjab. So if the police action continues, if there is
*27:41.760- 27:47.780* :  a deadlock in the talks between the two sides and there is a possibility that other farmers unions
*27:47.780- 27:52.600* :  from other states could also join. In that case, the protest will get intensified.
*27:53.360- 27:59.960* :  Ambarassan et Aarajan. Everybody loves a sporting comeback. And the Ivory Coast produced one of
*27:59.960- 28:06.000* :  the best in many years to win the African Cup of Nations on home turf. Their match winner in the
*28:06.000- 28:12.200* :  final against Nigeria was Sebastian Alair who recovered from cancer before resuming his career
*28:12.200- 28:18.020* :  at the highest level. And it was the culmination of a remarkable turnaround during the tournament.
*28:18.060- 28:23.180* :  The Ivory and squeezed into the knockout rounds after finishing third in their group.
*28:23.180- 28:29.860* :  They were hammered 4-0 by Equatorial Guinea and looked to be in disarray. But the coach Jean-Louis
*28:29.860- 28:35.480* :  Gasse was dramatically sacked midway through the tournament. And his replacement, Amarass
*28:35.480- 28:42.200* :  Faye, masterminded, what then followed. He's been talking to Sarah Menai about an extraordinary
*28:42.200- 28:48.420* :  story and began by describing the mood in the dressing room after the humbling by Equatorial Guinea.
*28:49.180- 28:57.620* :  A night man, a night man. The player was disappointed. We didn't expect to lose that by way.
*28:58.260- 29:05.220* :  I think the only one that takes the taken was the president. And he said it's not finished.
*29:05.980- 29:11.240* :  What did you have to do to change? Was it in the speech? Was it in the way you were doing
*29:11.240- 29:17.740* :  things with your players? Was it because you played for Ivory Coast? You know this team,
*29:17.740- 29:22.720* :  you know this country. You're one of them. Is that the thing that maybe you know changed the
*29:22.720- 29:28.300* :  approach for the players and also for you? Was it easier for you to talk to them and motivate
*29:28.300- 29:35.600* :  them as well? The most important, the player needs some confidence. They have quality.
*29:36.440- 29:44.960* :  Everybody knows all that. But at this moment, we need confidence. Our speech with the staff
*29:44.960- 29:51.420* :  technique where let's go guys. You're a good player. Forget what happens. You are very, very good
*29:51.420- 29:57.040* :  players. Think something else about it. And as I say to the player, we need to be a unit. We need
*29:57.040- 30:04.040* :  to be a block. As a player, Emerson, you lost enough confidence in 2006 against Egypt in Cairo.
*30:04.560- 30:10.040* :  Now at home, you win it as a manager for your first time on the bench. Is it personally for you
*30:10.040- 30:17.440* :  a sort of a little revenge as well? Yeah, it was so important for me. I lost one in final,
*30:17.440- 30:25.200* :  one in semifinal, and one in quarter final. After that, I had to stop my career for a health
*30:25.200- 30:32.520* :  problem. When I stopped my career, I saved what I couldn't win as a player. I have to do it as
*30:32.520- 30:40.140* :  manager to do this in my country. It's beautiful. It's so beautiful. Yeah, it's so revenge. Not
*30:40.300- 30:48.700* :  as my international career is a revenge of life because I stopped my career at 28. I felt
*30:48.700- 30:54.900* :  good, but I have to stop because it was to dangerous for my life. I'm very happy for my family too,
*30:55.240- 31:02.760* :  because it is not too easy for my wife and my two little girls to have this moment too. And I'm
*31:02.760- 31:10.500* :  very happy for her for example. There's a long, long competition and I have neck ache at this moment,
*31:10.500- 31:17.800* :  so I think I need, I need to, I need some rest. MSF, the manager of the victorious Ivory Coast
*31:17.800- 31:25.140* :  team at this year's African Cup of Nations. And that's all for us for now, but there will be a
