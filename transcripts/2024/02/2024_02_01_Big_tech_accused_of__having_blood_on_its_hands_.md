*01:22.160- 01:26.860* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Thursday, the first of February.
*01:26.860- 01:31.680* :  The bosses of Meta TikTok and other tech giants face tough questioning of the US Senate.
*01:31.900- 01:36.360* :  I'm so tired of this. It's been 28 years, what? Since the internet we haven't passed any of these
*01:36.360- 01:41.300* :  bells and the reason they haven't passed is because of the power of your companies. Mr. Zuckerberg,
*01:41.780- 01:44.540* :  you and the companies before us, you have blood on your hands.
*01:45.000- 01:50.400* :  So how did they respond? The UN says almost 8 million people have now been forced from their
*01:50.400- 01:57.000* :  homes by fighting in Sudan. And the US judge rules that Elon Musk's record 56 billion dollar pay
*01:57.000- 02:04.060* :  package from Tesla was invalid. Also in the podcast, a major boost for the Danish economy,
*02:04.060- 02:10.140* :  as the firm behind the weight loss drug Wiegervee posts a 51% increase in profits.
*02:19.180- 02:23.140* :  And the search for a Japanese macaque on the loose in the Scottish Highlands.
*02:27.460- 02:33.400* :  Democratic and Republican politicians in America don't agree on much, particularly in an election
*02:33.400- 02:38.120* :  year, but they are united in their disgust at the behaviour of social media companies.
*02:38.780- 02:43.740* :  And at a Senate hearing on Wednesday on child safety, they didn't hold back,
*02:43.740- 02:50.020* :  firing questions at five tech bosses. Mr. Zuckerberg, you and the companies before us,
*02:50.260- 02:53.220* :  I know you don't mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands.
*02:55.440- 03:01.620* :  You have a product that's killing people. When we had cigarettes killing people, we did some about
*03:01.620- 03:07.120* :  it, maybe not enough. You're going to talk about guns, we have the ATF. There's not a damn thing
*03:07.120- 03:11.940* :  anybody can do about it. You can't be sued. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham taking aim at
*03:11.940- 03:17.600* :  Metaboss Mark Zuckerberg. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar was equally scathing.
*03:18.060- 03:21.980* :  I'm so tired of this. It's been 28 years since the internet. We haven't passed any of these
*03:21.980- 03:26.400* :  bills. It's time to actually pass them. And the reason they haven't passed is because of the
*03:26.400- 03:31.260* :  power of your company. So let's be really clear about that. What you say matters, your words
*03:31.260- 03:37.140* :  matter. At one point, Mr. Zuckerberg was prompted to stand up and apologise to family members in
*03:37.140- 03:41.820* :  the chamber, holding up pictures of children who'd suffered from online harm. In his statement,
*03:41.820- 03:46.540* :  he admitted there was more to be done. Keeping young people safe online has been a challenge
*03:46.540- 03:51.100* :  since the internet began. We work closely with law enforcement to find bad actors and help bring
*03:51.100- 03:56.060* :  them to justice. But the difficult reality is that no matter how much we invest or how effective
*03:56.060- 04:00.520* :  our tools are, there's always more to learn and more improvements to make. But we remain ready to
*04:00.520- 04:04.700* :  work with members of this committee industry and parents to make the internet safe for everyone.
*04:05.300- 04:10.480* :  Mr. Zuckerberg, who oversees Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, agreed to testify voluntarily,
*04:10.480- 04:17.600* :  as did the CEO of TikTok. But the buses of Snap, X and Discord refused and had to be issued
*04:17.600- 04:23.500* :  with subpoenas, the latter too, in person by US Marshals. I heard more about the hearing itself
*04:23.500- 04:29.220* :  from our correspondent Nomiya Ikbal on Capitol Hill. There are so many issues. Essentially,
*04:29.220- 04:33.940* :  watched the Senate have been highlighting for many years at the continuing risk of child
*04:33.940- 04:39.320* :  sexual abuse material on these sites. The Senate Judiciary Committee has supported
*04:39.780- 04:44.740* :  many bills related to kids' digital safety. And so you've got social media platforms who are
*04:44.740- 04:49.700* :  being increasingly scrutinised because there's growing evidence, Congress says, that suggests
*04:49.700- 04:54.900* :  that excessive use and the proliferation of harmful content is damaging young people's mental health.
*04:54.900- 04:59.140* :  In 2007, there were hearings held in Congress to address the rising reports of online
*04:59.140- 05:03.820* :  child abuse. At the time of law enforcement investigators said, I quote, they were overwhelmed,
*05:03.820- 05:09.760* :  underfunded and drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy. And that year tech companies reported
*05:09.760- 05:17.140* :  100,000 reports of illegal material. Last year, they reported 36.2 million. So that gives you a
*05:17.140- 05:23.400* :  sense of just how much the problem has grown over the last decade or so. Will anything concrete come
*05:23.400- 05:28.280* :  out in this hearing in terms of perhaps laws or regulations? Well, this is the problem. There's been
*05:28.280- 05:33.620* :  many hearings like this. There have been bills that have been perished present. Biden has talked
*05:33.620- 05:38.480* :  about it in his last two states of the Union addresses, yet nothing really seems to come of it.
*05:38.480- 05:43.700* :  I think one law was passed in the last decade and that was a pretty narrow law related to trafficking
*05:43.740- 05:50.560* :  online. What the Judiciary Committee wants is for these CEOs to commit to certain bills.
*05:50.940- 05:55.720* :  The Kids Online Safety Act, another bill, Stop Child Sexual Abuse Material Act, and this chips
*05:55.720- 06:00.340* :  the way it tech companies legal protections to allow victims to sue them. During the hearing,
*06:00.340- 06:06.480* :  ex's Linda Giacarino said that she would endorse that. So that would be seen as a windfall
*06:06.480- 06:09.900* :  lawmaker. And they kept asking them throughout the hearing, will you commit to this? Will you commit
*06:09.900- 06:15.560* :  to that? And many of them were not forthcoming with it. Nomiya Igbalon, Capital Hill in Washington,
*06:15.560- 06:20.900* :  and we will return to this story and in particular, focus on Facebook a little later in the podcast.
*06:21.900- 06:26.360* :  In the nine months, since the army and its paramilitary rival, the rapid support forces began a
*06:26.360- 06:31.920* :  power struggle in Sudan. Nearly eight million people, half of them children, have been forced from
*06:31.920- 06:37.440* :  their homes, according to the UN Refugee Agency Chief Philip O'Grande. He was speaking in Ethiopia
*06:37.440- 06:43.720* :  where some of the refugees have fled to. Others have gone to Chad and South Sudan. But most of the
*06:43.720- 06:49.120* :  displaced people are still in Sudan, trying to avoid getting caught up in the fighting that's
*06:49.120- 06:55.380* :  left 13,000 people dead. Our correspondent, Kalkedan Yebazhal, told me what conditions are like
*06:55.380- 07:01.520* :  in Sudan. The humanitarian situation is very dire because of the security situation and because
*07:01.520- 07:07.280* :  of the fluidity of the violence itself. Around 1.2 million people have fled the country altogether.
*07:07.280- 07:13.200* :  They are in neighboring countries like Ethiopia, like Chad and Egypt. But these countries have their
*07:13.200- 07:18.540* :  own problems. Chad is a very poor country, for example. And Ethiopia has its own problems with
*07:18.540- 07:23.400* :  ongoing conflicts, which means people are not receiving sufficient aid. But the most pressing
*07:23.400- 07:28.400* :  issue right now is the escalation of the fighting. If the fighting and the violence continues to
*07:28.400- 07:32.580* :  rate as it does now, it means more people are going to be pushed out of their homes and the
*07:32.580- 07:37.720* :  situation is going to worsen. So is any aid getting through? Aid is getting through, but it's not
*07:37.720- 07:43.940* :  sufficient. Some of the medical facilities are not operating fully because there is violence in
*07:43.940- 07:48.740* :  Khartoum and Western Darfur. Humanitarian agencies in those areas are not operating
*07:48.740- 07:54.940* :  up to scale. In addition to that, the UN is complaining that there is significant gap in funding.
*07:54.940- 08:00.380* :  They have to compete for donors as there are other pressing crises across the world.
*08:00.740- 08:06.720* :  Now, there have been countless attempts at forging a ceasefire in Sudan. Where are we with the
*08:06.720- 08:11.060* :  latest efforts to end the fighting? There isn't that much hope to us things stand. They have
*08:11.060- 08:15.580* :  been efforts by the U.S. and the Saudi governments, by the African Union, and by the regional
*08:15.580- 08:20.340* :  block of East African countries. But none of these efforts have succeeded to bring the two
*08:20.720- 08:25.620* :  warring parties together to find a solution. What we're hearing is the escalation of the
*08:25.620- 08:32.020* :  fighting and the expansion of it to areas that had previously been relatively calm. Also,
*08:32.020- 08:37.020* :  the head of the Sudanese Army General Anburan has reportedly ordered a large-scale offensive
*08:37.020- 08:41.560* :  eigenist positions held by the Aresif. All this suggests that the fighting is
*08:41.560- 08:47.220* :  calything rather than decality. Calcutta and Yebel Tal in Ethiopia talking to me about events
*08:47.220- 08:53.140* :  in Sudan. On Sunday, at least two ministers from the Israeli government attended a controversial
*08:53.140- 08:59.820* :  meeting in Jerusalem, calling for Jewish settlements to be re-established in Gaza. The U.S.,
*08:59.820- 09:04.480* :  Germany and France all condemned the idea, with the White House criticizing what it called
*09:04.480- 09:11.100* :  incendiary and irresponsible rhetoric. The move has long been championed by far-right groups in
*09:11.100- 09:17.000* :  Israel, but it's been given renewed attention following the Hamas attacks of the 7th of October.
*09:17.880- 09:22.560* :  Many Palestinians believe Israel's ultimate aim is to force them out of the Gaza Strip altogether.
*09:22.620- 09:28.780* :  Daniela Weiss is a leading figure in the settler movement and was at the conference. She spoke to
*09:28.780- 09:36.180* :  Rebecca Kesby. After the 7th of October, history changed. Hamas will not stay, supporters of Hamas
*09:36.300- 09:42.320* :  will not stay, and those who want to live normally will not live in Gaza, but in other free countries
*09:42.320- 09:47.980* :  of the world. Why should they leave Gaza? Is there home? Because they committed something that
*09:47.980- 09:53.800* :  is against all human normal behavior. Well, the civilians didn't, did they? They're just
*09:53.800- 09:59.660* :  civilians. I know you don't mean what you say, because some people use these expressions. 80%
*09:59.740- 10:05.600* :  of the population in Gaza support Hamas. I'm not sure that we do have the statistics on that.
*10:05.600- 10:10.620* :  What we do know is that a very large percentage of the population are children. Roughly 50%
*10:10.700- 10:16.880* :  of the population of Gaza is under the age of 80. There's a very large number of civilians who
*10:16.880- 10:22.420* :  do not support Hamas. What we do know is that they're non-combatants. Do you want to push them
*10:22.420- 10:28.780* :  out, forcibly? We'll encourage them. One of the things that are necessary is prevent any humanitarian
*10:28.780- 10:36.440* :  help until we get the last of the hostages. To a lot of people, including millions of Jewish people
*10:36.440- 10:43.280* :  around the world, what that sounds like is using humanitarian aid as a weapon of war, possibly
*10:43.280- 10:48.820* :  using starvation as a weapon of war, and it certainly sounds very like ethnic cleansing.
*10:49.140- 10:57.540* :  You know what I have in my mind? 136 Jews that are a part of my Jewish nation, and the normal
*10:57.540- 11:04.400* :  thing for every nation is to think first of the members who are suffering. We want to see them free.
*11:04.580- 11:11.060* :  And if for that people of the enemy die, this is the normal behavior of the world.
*11:11.240- 11:18.420* :  Around 20% of Israeli citizens are Arabs, most of them being Muslim. Are you happy for them to
*11:18.420- 11:23.840* :  stay Israeli? I prefer that they will be more loyal to the state of Israel, but Ben Gurion,
*11:23.840- 11:29.740* :  the founder of the state of Israel, gave equal rights, so it stays. In spite of the fact that
*11:29.740- 11:35.320* :  Arab members of Gaza to represent the Arab population are very much not loyal to the state of Israel,
*11:35.320- 11:41.340* :  but this is a fact of history that I'm not picking about changing. Many Jewish people, many Israelis
*11:41.340- 11:47.560* :  listening to you will find your views abhorrent. And this is against government policy anyway,
*11:47.560- 11:52.800* :  what you're suggesting. This is exactly our role to promote an idea, even if it doesn't go
*11:52.800- 11:57.940* :  handy and with the current policy, but I can assure you and assure the listeners our attitude
*11:57.940- 12:05.180* :  will grow. And finally, this will be the situation in Gaza. Gaza now under Hamas Israel, and the Jews
*12:05.180- 12:10.080* :  will turn it into paradise on earth. Daniela Vice talking to Rebecca Kesby.
*12:10.660- 12:16.000* :  Shares in Tesla have fallen after a judge in the US cancelled a record breaking pay deal
*12:16.340- 12:23.040* :  awarded to its founder Elon Musk. The package, worth just under $56 billion, helped make Mr.
*12:23.040- 12:28.780* :  Musk the richest man in the world when it was announced in 2018. A shareholder complained that Mr.
*12:28.780- 12:34.240* :  Musk had been overpaid and brought the legal action, despite owning just nine shares. His
*12:34.240- 12:41.060* :  business editor Simon Jack. In 2018, nearly 80% of Tesla shareholders approved a plan to award Elon
*12:41.060- 12:46.640* :  Musk options or the right to buy over 300 million shares in the company at a knockdown price.
*12:46.640- 12:53.160* :  If the share price rocketed, those rights would rock it in value to over $55 billion. And indeed,
*12:53.160- 12:58.540* :  Tesla shares rose nearly 20 fold at one point, making Elon Musk the richest person in the world.
*12:58.620- 13:04.160* :  But Richard Torneta challenged the deal in a court in the state of Delaware where Tesla is legally
*13:04.160- 13:09.800* :  registered, arguing it was unfair to other shareholders well beyond what was needed to incentivize Mr.
*13:09.900- 13:15.900* :  Musk and granted by directors in awe of him. The Delaware judge agreed and yesterday nullified the
*13:15.900- 13:22.020* :  deal. Elon Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, which he also controls, never incorporate your company
*13:22.020- 13:29.500* :  in the state of Delaware. He now owns 13% of Tesla, down from over 20% and short of the 25% he would
*13:29.500- 13:35.040* :  like to feel in control of the company. The decision can and probably will be appealed once legal
*13:35.040- 13:40.140* :  fees so far have been settled, so the biggest pay route in history may have further to run.
*13:40.520- 13:46.380* :  Our business editor, Simon Jack. Now to an extraordinary story about three siblings who were dumped
*13:46.380- 13:52.900* :  by their biological parents in small towns in Ireland in the 1960s. All were adopted, had good
*13:52.900- 13:59.720* :  lives and have been reunited through DNA testing. But the story of Helen Ward, David McBride and John
*13:59.720- 14:05.200* :  Dowling doesn't end there, and they're hoping that listeners will be able to help them. All three
*14:05.200- 14:10.700* :  are what are known as Foundlings. Helen started by explaining what that means to Nulam Aguavan.
*14:10.920- 14:15.680* :  Foundling is something that has been found or someone that has been found. In my case,
*14:15.680- 14:24.760* :  it was myself as a baby found abandoned back in 1968. And David? I was found in a place called
*14:24.760- 14:30.380* :  Don Murray just about three miles from Belfast. I was found in a car. My was well fed, well taken
*14:30.380- 14:36.600* :  care of, and I was found by a doctor's wife. And to you, John? I was found in the second of me
*14:36.600- 14:41.780* :  and rather in 1965 in the phone, but well wrapped up with a warm bottle of milk. I was found by
*14:42.540- 14:48.400* :  two men. Helen, take us through how you have met your brother, David and your brother, John.
*14:48.600- 14:59.480* :  In 2018, I put my DNA up onto one of the sites. And in 2019, I got a call from Lunglaus families
*14:59.480- 15:06.200* :  to say I had connected with a full sibling who was also searching. This is a television program
*15:06.200- 15:13.260* :  that reunites, family members that perhaps were adopted and had lost touch with one another,
*15:13.260- 15:19.780* :  but want to find one another. That's right. Shortly after that, we were asked to come back to do
*15:20.020- 15:25.160* :  another little bit of filming. And we were told that we had another full sibling. And that was our
*15:25.160- 15:32.220* :  brother, John. David, what was that like to find out that you had a sibling? Quite surreal, but it
*15:32.220- 15:36.980* :  was one of the most fantastic feelings. It's as if we had known each other all our lives. Helen
*15:36.980- 15:41.400* :  came into the room. There was TV cameras rolling, but we just ignored them and we sat there.
*15:41.400- 15:45.220* :  Well, over two hours just talking. John, so where do you come into the picture? It's funny.
*15:45.560- 15:50.440* :  My daughter in Australia saw a program of David and Helen and she noticed that there were
*15:50.440- 15:56.140* :  similarities between David and myself. I watched it the next night and then done a rank
*15:56.140- 16:03.300* :  me to know what I do with DNA tests. I did the DNA tests, the start of 21 by Easter. I knew that
*16:03.300- 16:07.980* :  David and Helen were full siblings of mine. Your daughter is watching on television down in Australia
*16:07.980- 16:13.080* :  and just by physical similarities, she's like, he's like dad. Yes, she said that David actually walked
*16:13.080- 16:17.880* :  a bit like dad and gave his hands or like my hands. And she was dead, right? It was amazingly.
*16:18.560- 16:24.400* :  Our mother was a Catholic. Our father was a Protestant. That in itself, getting together was a taboo in
*16:24.400- 16:29.900* :  Ireland. Then our mother and father had an affair out of wedlock. She fell pregnant to a married man.
*16:30.380- 16:34.480* :  She hid all the three taboos at Irish culture, hid it. We may not have had any life at all.
*16:34.880- 16:38.880* :  That made me the best decision made to place us somewhere where we could be found.
*16:38.880- 16:47.260* :  But that is not where this extraordinary story ends. In September 2022, it was made aware to me that
*16:47.260- 16:55.240* :  there was another baby discovered in similar circumstances to us. They were found in Nuri in 1963.
*16:55.260- 17:00.740* :  It was a little boy and I think he was named Michael. Of course, cause of the similarities.
*17:00.880- 17:07.100* :  It's a lurch of the three of us to say, perhaps there is a fourth. So we were all found in a bag
*17:07.640- 17:13.680* :  very well dressed. We were all very well looked after at birth. I think this person, if they are
*17:13.680- 17:19.620* :  listening, that they should get in contact with us because it would be a shame for this person not
*17:19.620- 17:25.040* :  to get in contact with us and do a DNA test and maybe find out that he may be part of our family,
*17:25.240- 17:30.700* :  which is a joyous occasion. I have to say it's a really deep emotional journey, which requires
*17:30.700- 17:37.220* :  a lot of thought. But for me to have and achieved this amount of goodness, it's absolutely incredible.
*17:37.800- 17:43.500* :  Helen Ward, David McBride and John Dowling talking to Nulant McGovern and the address to contact them
*17:43.500- 17:52.440* :  is family3.info at gmail.com family3 with the number 3.info at gmail.com
*17:54.920- 17:59.440* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. The world is burning around us Elmo.
*17:59.860- 18:06.420* :  Elmo. We are tired. The extraordinary outpouring of emotion on social media prompted by a simple
*18:06.420- 18:08.580* :  question from a TV puppet.
*18:13.480- 18:18.540* :  Ovo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical firm behind the popular obesity and diabetes
*18:18.540- 18:24.900* :  jabs Wiegervy and Ozempik, has reported record profits driven by surging sales.
*18:24.940- 18:31.780* :  The firm said net profits had risen over 50 per cent in 2023 to more than 12 billion dollars.
*18:32.280- 18:36.980* :  From Copenhagen, here's Adrian Murray. Compared to Danish firms Lego or Cosburg,
*18:36.980- 18:42.720* :  Nulant McGovern is hardly a household name. Yet it's now Europe's most valuable company
*18:42.720- 18:48.760* :  with more than 500 billion dollars. Its rapid growth has been driven by booming sales of the
*18:48.760- 18:54.000* :  blockbuster medications we govina Zempik. We gov is a weekly weight loss injection,
*18:54.000- 18:59.660* :  intended for people who are severely overweight. While Ozempik is a type 2 diabetes treatment
*18:59.660- 19:05.700* :  made from the same ingredient. Both drugs have flown off pharmacy shelves after social media buzz
*19:05.700- 19:10.300* :  and reports of famous celebrities using the drugs have helped fuel their popularity.
*19:10.900- 19:17.360* :  Sales of Wiegervy alone increased fivefold over 2023. However, the Denmark-based drug maker
*19:17.360- 19:22.760* :  has struggled to meet demand and said it was boosting supplies of Wiegervy to tackle the shortages.
*19:23.260- 19:27.240* :  Never noticed Chief Financial Officer Carson Munch Newsson told the BBC
*19:27.240- 19:31.140* :  that the firm is investing billions of dollars to ramp up production.
*19:31.400- 19:34.660* :  I don't think we'll be able to meet demand anytime soon. We're only serving
*19:34.660- 19:39.220* :  call it to the tune of one million patients on an annual ice basis out of more than 800
*19:39.220- 19:43.340* :  million people with obesity globally. And we're investing significantly to scale to that.
*19:43.680- 19:48.780* :  We gov is now sold in six countries. Most recently, it's entered the UK and will launch in Japan
*19:48.780- 19:53.980* :  this month. It's the first to market of a new generation of medications that some predict
*19:53.980- 19:59.480* :  will revolutionise the weight loss industry. American rival Eli Lilly has produced the drugs
*19:59.480- 20:04.680* :  Muncharo and Zepburned, while other large manufacturers are expected to follow, however,
*20:04.680- 20:10.460* :  the booming weight loss drugs has also sparked sharp debate over their affordability and impact
*20:10.460- 20:17.860* :  on society. Adrian Murray in Copenhagen. Returning to our top story, the US Senate Judiciary
*20:17.860- 20:22.900* :  Committee's questioning of some of the world's biggest tech companies. Politicians from both
*20:22.900- 20:28.360* :  parties said firms with hundreds of millions of young users were not doing enough to safeguard
*20:28.360- 20:35.340* :  children from online exploitation. Munch Zuckerberg said his firm meta had a robust system in
*20:35.340- 20:39.480* :  place to protect young people online. Being a parent is one of the hardest jobs in the world.
*20:39.800- 20:43.360* :  Technology gives us new ways to communicate with our kids and feel connected to their lives,
*20:43.360- 20:47.340* :  but it can also make parenting more complicated. And it's important to me that our services are
*20:47.340- 20:51.580* :  positive for everyone who uses them. We are on the side of parents everywhere working hard
*20:51.580- 20:55.680* :  to raise their kids. Over the last eight years, we've built more than 30 different tools,
*20:55.680- 20:59.800* :  resources, and features that parents can set time limits for their teens using our apps,
*21:00.000- 21:03.260* :  see who they're following, or if they report someone for bullying.
*21:03.840- 21:09.140* :  Mr Zuckerberg's appearance in the Senate came almost 20 years after Facebook went live for the
*21:09.140- 21:15.260* :  first time in his Harvard University room. The firm has since grown into a trillion dollar
*21:15.260- 21:20.880* :  enterprise, incorporating WhatsApp and Instagram. And while Mr Zuckerberg has been increasingly
*21:20.880- 21:26.440* :  criticized for failing to adequately safeguard users from harm, that hasn't stopped his empire
*21:26.440- 21:32.480* :  from growing even bigger. Stephen Levy, editor at large of Wired and author of Facebook,
*21:32.480- 21:35.840* :  The Inside Story, takes a look back at how it all began.
*21:36.340- 21:40.940* :  There's a video of Mark Zuckerberg where his father had gotten his acceptance letter to Harvard
*21:40.940- 21:45.680* :  and sprung the news on him. Oh, well, Mark was doing something on a computer.
*21:45.700- 21:47.000* :  What does it say?
*21:47.300- 21:48.900* :  For the wait for a second. I can't say it.
*21:49.020- 21:50.880* :  He seems a lot more interested in playing with a computer.
*21:51.340- 21:53.520* :  Yeah, I got accepted. Are you serious?
*21:54.540- 21:54.940* :  All right.
*21:55.200- 21:59.980* :  What excites him? He's very blus-a about that. Really, he's almost like annoyed being pulled away from
*21:59.980- 22:03.380* :  a video game while his dad tells him he's going to Harvard.
*22:03.440- 22:07.120* :  And now there's a new form of cyber matchmaking, college networking websites.
*22:07.660- 22:09.160* :  Is this perhaps the next big thing?
*22:09.160- 22:14.440* :  This culminated in February 2004, came out with something that he called Facebook,
*22:14.960- 22:19.500* :  which was a digital version of the physical yearbook kind of thing.
*22:19.600- 22:21.100* :  It took off like a rocket ship.
*22:21.100- 22:24.060* :  How big do you think your product or your service is?
*22:24.420- 22:28.080* :  When we first launched, we were hoping for, you know, maybe 400, 500 people.
*22:28.480- 22:31.700* :  And now we're at 100,000 people. So who knows where we're going next?
*22:31.700- 22:37.480* :  He was lucky enough to have launched it in an environment where people wanted to know
*22:38.040- 22:42.900* :  more about their fellow students. When he built that up, he had learned a lot about what people
*22:42.900- 22:48.800* :  wanted to see. And when he threw it out there with the newsfeed, they were able to populate
*22:48.800- 22:52.100* :  the newsfeed with the kinds of things that would engage people.
*22:58.080- 23:02.040* :  Our blue was 2009. This deal was Spotify that they made.
*23:03.200- 23:08.640* :  I remember which was Lavish Party and they had the killers and Snoop Dogg and Mark was standing
*23:08.640- 23:14.960* :  on a table, streaking the words of Snoop Dogg lyrics. It was pretty well.
*23:16.540- 23:22.200* :  In around 2012, he had to deal with the crisis of the world was moving to mobile technology.
*23:23.900- 23:26.080* :  And we are calling it iPhone.
*23:26.080- 23:30.960* :  That wasn't what Facebook was built for. So we had to almost restart the company from a technological
*23:30.960- 23:36.040* :  sense and also figure out how the ad model would work with mobile. And he did that,
*23:36.040- 23:40.480* :  but not in time to prevent somewhat of a disaster when the company went public.
*23:40.480- 23:45.400* :  But soon after that, they recovered really nicely. That was also the year they bought Instagram
*23:45.420- 23:47.580* :  that turned out very well for Facebook.
*23:47.800- 23:53.820* :  It is my high honor to introduce to you the president elect of the United States
*23:53.900- 24:00.180* :  of America Donald Trump. 2016 in the election was a huge inflection point for Facebook.
*24:00.660- 24:06.360* :  They had been cited for privacy violations before and some of the other products caused problems.
*24:06.360- 24:11.320* :  But they managed to skate all by that until the day after the 2016 election,
*24:11.860- 24:15.720* :  when Donald Trump was elected and a lot of people all of a sudden turned to Facebook and said,
*24:15.720- 24:20.180* :  wait a minute, didn't you help make this happen? And then people started to focus more closely
*24:20.180- 24:22.740* :  on the dark side of Facebook.
*24:22.920- 24:28.240* :  My goal was never really to make Facebook cool. I am not a cool person. The services that we aspire
*24:28.240- 24:33.420* :  to be like in the world are kind of these basic things that you can rely on and that you'd
*24:33.420- 24:37.420* :  probably pretty upset if they went away, but you're not like sitting around celebrating all day long.
*24:37.420- 24:43.660* :  The shift in name to the metaverse and now AI is the current model where in terms of Mark's
*24:43.660- 24:50.860* :  interests, the attention he's paying is to the future meta Facebook, whereas it still is a social
*24:50.860- 24:55.900* :  media company that gets virtually all their revenues and certainly all their profits from social media.
*24:56.160- 25:02.720* :  Facebook was the tool by which we became social on the internet and it connected a lot of people
*25:02.720- 25:09.640* :  and continues to in a lot of ways in a positive way, but also in some troubling ways.
*25:09.640- 25:15.500* :  And I think we're still grappling with the good and bad of social media like we're grappling
*25:15.500- 25:19.000* :  with the good and bad of artificial intelligence in every advance of technology.
*25:19.400- 25:24.660* :  Stephen Levy on the 20th anniversary of Facebook. At the peak of the Roman Empire,
*25:24.700- 25:28.960* :  its army was protecting and policing a quarter of the world's then population.
*25:29.720- 25:33.620* :  Military bases and family accommodation could be found everywhere from the Middle East and
*25:33.620- 25:39.000* :  North Africa to Britain and it will all feature in a new exhibition called Legion at the British
*25:39.000- 25:45.240* :  Museum here in London. Charlotte Higgins is the author of Under Another Sky Journeys in Roman Britain.
*25:45.860- 25:50.100* :  Michelle Hussain asked if there was much of a Roman legacy left in Britain.
*25:50.760- 25:56.080* :  Huge and impressive amounts, Michelle, and there's a beautiful selection in the Legion exhibition.
*25:56.220- 26:01.400* :  There was a remarkable site called Bindelander in which extraordinary items were preserved
*26:01.400- 26:08.480* :  in the wet sod of Northumberland, hobnail boots and sandals and shoes belonging to not just Roman
*26:08.480- 26:15.300* :  men but Roman women and an incredible treasury of written material that miraculously survived.
*26:15.960- 26:23.160* :  And that includes, I find, ineffably touching, a letter from one Roman military wife to another
*26:23.160- 26:29.840* :  inviting her to a birthday party which includes the earliest known handwriting from a woman
*26:29.840- 26:35.340* :  anywhere in the Roman Empire. That's from the first century AD. So Britain is incredibly rich
*26:35.340- 26:40.640* :  with material and it shows a very rounded picture and I think that the exhibition does a great
*26:40.640- 26:46.480* :  job of that. That this is a kind of killing machine, the Roman army and the kind of artillery,
*26:46.480- 26:52.100* :  the technology as you can sort of see it as the precursors of the T80s that are rolling through
*26:52.100- 26:59.280* :  Ukraine at the moment. But also these are sort of ordinary lives, families, women, children and
*26:59.280- 27:05.580* :  enslaved people, there's a whole sort of community in the round. And did the Roman army recruit from
*27:05.580- 27:11.660* :  amongst the indigenous population? So the, I don't know, we can call them the the Britons of that time.
*27:11.660- 27:16.100* :  Could they end up in the ranks? Definitely, part of the way the Roman Empire
*27:16.100- 27:23.880* :  operated, it sort of modus operandi was subdue the natives, enroll the elites into the function
*27:23.880- 27:29.420* :  of the administration of the empire and recruit locally. I mean, that's how the whole thing
*27:29.920- 27:35.420* :  kept going, which means that in Britain, for example, you get this one could say multi-cultural
*27:36.080- 27:42.640* :  population of soldiers and their dependents. You know, they were people from Syria, from Iraq,
*27:42.780- 27:49.320* :  from Spain, the Netherlands, from Germany, living here in Britain, which is an interesting
*27:49.320- 27:56.800* :  disruption to maybe some of our received ideas about the nature of Britain and its ethnic make-up.
*27:57.240- 28:01.520* :  Charlotte Higgins talking to Michelle has seen. In many parts of the world it would be no
*28:01.520- 28:06.780* :  surprise to see a monkey wondering about, but not in the Highlands of Scotland. A Japanese
*28:06.780- 28:12.260* :  macaque remains on the loose in a remote village after escaping from a wildlife park at the weekend.
*28:12.260- 28:17.200* :  Drones spotted the monkey roaming the Scottish Highlands before it ended up in the village of
*28:17.200- 28:22.640* :  Kin Craig. They've been several sightings, including one just 300 meters from the park's entrance.
*28:23.400- 28:28.600* :  Karl Nagel and his partner Tina Salzburg couldn't believe it when they saw the creature in their
*28:28.600- 28:46.180* :  backyard on Sunday morning. This is insane. They spoke to Sarah Montague about that moment.
*28:46.700- 28:51.500* :  I was awoken by a call from my daughter saying there's a monkey on your street dad because it'd
*28:51.500- 28:55.220* :  been seen on a local Facebook group posted in the garden across the street and that's like
*28:55.220- 28:59.980* :  one of the chances came to my patio where it was indeed shot to see a monkey going for my nuts
*29:00.420- 29:05.040* :  and I'm normally very protective of them. They've got all sorts of contraptions and feeders there
*29:05.040- 29:13.360* :  that the squirrels tried to the squirrels. I should have made that clear and he was there feeding
*29:13.360- 29:17.460* :  on bits that had fallen out and then got upon to the fence and started to have a real crack at one
*29:17.460- 29:22.240* :  of them. It's just the incongruity of seeing it in a Japanese snow monkey in a Scottish garden.
*29:22.240- 29:27.220* :  Seems to have captured a few people's imaginations. Did you feel like going out to see the monkey?
*29:27.680- 29:33.820* :  No. Well, I did. I was like, let's go out there. I wanted to open the back door.
*29:33.820- 29:38.920* :  Karl started freaking out a little bit and he was like, honey, don't open the door. Remember what
*29:38.920- 29:45.500* :  happened to me 30 years ago in Thailand when I was attacked by a rabid monkey? It doesn't look
*29:45.500- 29:51.100* :  so rabid, but okay, I'll keep the door shut. This is Sunday morning. It's now Wednesday, yeah.
*29:51.360- 29:56.840* :  So what's the information about where he is now? So there's been something of a widespread monkey
*29:56.840- 30:01.820* :  hunt going on in the village for the whole time. As far as we know, he was spent most of his time
*30:01.820- 30:05.600* :  hunking down at the north end of the village where they've had all these drones up trying to
*30:05.980- 30:10.040* :  keep sight of him. A few of the residents did see him, I think, as he made his way there on Sunday
*30:10.040- 30:15.700* :  through their gardens, but last I heard he was making his way back towards the park, which is
*30:15.700- 30:20.800* :  everybody's hope because their social want to be back with these troops. There's a food issue
*30:20.800- 30:25.220* :  I guess as well. The weather whilst they're built for it is not terribly hospitable up here at the
*30:25.220- 30:31.020* :  moment. It's blowing a hoolly out there and it's quite cold. So maybe he's like enough game over.
*30:31.320- 30:36.500* :  Has it made you nervous to go out? No. If anything, I think every time we've gone out anywhere and
*30:36.500- 30:40.320* :  carl walking in the last few days, you're convinced you're going to see him again.
*30:40.480- 30:44.640* :  There's lots of wildlife up here, whether it's a pheasant or a red squirrel or whatever,
*30:44.640- 30:49.820* :  you convince yourself that the monkey has just run by. Carl, thanks very much that he's a kindred
*30:49.820- 30:53.940* :  spirit with this monkey. So it's hoping the monkey will come back.
*30:54.340- 31:01.140* :  Tina Salzburg and Carl Nagle talking to Sarah Montague. Finally, to coin a phrase, how is everybody
*31:01.820- 31:06.740* :  doing? Well, the answer, it seems, is not great. When Elmo, the Muppet from the Children's
*31:06.740- 31:10.900* :  TV show Sesame Street, took to X or Twitter to ask people how they were,
*31:10.900- 31:16.960* :  thousands replied, including celebrities and even the US president. People told stories of
*31:16.960- 31:22.300* :  distress and anguish at the state of the world or their personal lives. But it also led to the
*31:22.300- 31:26.500* :  sharing of an important mental health message. Sean Wales takes up the story.
*31:34.120- 31:39.000* :  Beloved Children's TV character, Elmo loves spreading messages of positivity.
*31:42.940- 31:48.420* :  But a simple question posed to Elmo's followers on X seems to have triggered a collective
*31:48.420- 31:54.020* :  internet-based breakdown. The Sesame Street star asked people how they were doing,
*31:54.020- 32:00.140* :  and while the replies weren't all that uplifting. Elmo, I'm suffering from existential
*32:00.140- 32:04.380* :  dread over here. The world is burning around us, Elmo.
*32:05.520- 32:12.160* :  Elmo, we are tired. In the backdrop of ongoing global conflicts and midwinter blues for many
*32:12.160- 32:17.580* :  in the Northern Hemisphere, the post gathered more than 12,000 replies. Celebrities,
*32:17.580- 32:23.920* :  such as actress Rachel Zegler, joined in, saying she was resisting the urge to tell Elmo that
*32:23.920- 32:31.720* :  I am kind of sad. Elmo said we're not playing with Elmo. Elmo isn't immune to the ups and
*32:31.720- 32:39.420* :  downs of everyday life. Elmo very sad. But after reaching over 176 million people,
*32:39.420- 32:44.260* :  the Muppet had a message of encouragement for those doing it tough, with the hashtag
*32:44.260- 32:50.880* :  emotional well-being. Elmo posted another message. It read, ask a friend how they are doing.
*32:50.880- 32:57.780* :  Elmo loves you. A sentiment shared by the US President Joe Biden, who reposted with this message,
*32:58.380- 33:04.180* :  offer our help to a neighbour in need, and above all else, ask for help when we need it.
*33:07.080- 33:10.220* :  Hopefully by encouraging people to look after one another,
*33:10.640- 33:13.900* :  Elmo will have a few more doing their own little happy dance.
