*01:13.980- 01:21.700* :  Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 28th of February,
*01:21.700- 01:27.760* :  these are our main stories. Alexey Navalny's widow, Julia, attacks President Putin in a powerful
*01:27.760- 01:32.520* :  address to the European Parliament. There's been a sharp rise in the number of people seeking a
*01:32.520- 01:38.640* :  asylum inside the European Union. South Korea says its birth rate has fallen to a record low,
*01:39.060- 01:43.040* :  raising concerns its working age population will halve within decades.
*01:45.940- 01:51.100* :  Also in this podcast, why the British government is spending millions to improve the safety of
*01:51.100- 01:54.840* :  members of parliament and... There are people here who are absolutely disgusted by him.
*01:56.540- 01:58.740* :  Can you tell me how you think you ended up in that place?
*02:00.740- 02:05.920* :  Yeah, I'm going to tell you everything. A new documentary that lifts the veil on the story of the
*02:05.920- 02:15.880* :  disgraced fashion designer John Galliano. The funeral of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey
*02:15.880- 02:21.780* :  Navalny will be held in Moscow on Friday, two weeks after he died in prison. He was serving a
*02:21.780- 02:27.560* :  nine-year sentence in Siberia after being convicted of extremism by the Russian authorities.
*02:28.520- 02:34.100* :  On Wednesday, his wife, Julia Navalnya, addressed the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
*02:34.140- 02:40.100* :  In an impassioned speech, she said her husband was tortured for three years before he was murdered,
*02:41.000- 02:46.080* :  describing President Putin as the head of an organized crime gang who cannot be reasoned with.
*02:46.540- 02:55.100* :  If you really want to defeat Putin, you have to become an innovator. You have to stop being boring.
*02:59.860- 03:06.480* :  You cannot defeat him by thinking he's a man of principle who has morals and truths.
*03:07.500- 03:15.300* :  And Alexey realized that a long time ago. You are not dealing with a politician but with a
*03:15.300- 03:20.300* :  bloody monster. Our Europe correspondent Nick Beak is in Strasbourg.
*03:20.740- 03:25.800* :  I think certainly this was a really supportive audience for the message that was being sent out.
*03:25.860- 03:30.520* :  And there was a comparison being drawn with elections that would take place in Europe later this
*03:30.560- 03:36.020* :  year where Julia Navalnya was saying that the candidates would be free to do interviews with who
*03:36.020- 03:41.240* :  they wanted to and they'd be able to put out videos, messages, canvas on the streets.
*03:41.940- 03:46.360* :  And that simply isn't the case in Russia and that people should think long and hard.
*03:46.360- 03:51.400* :  It was all well and good passing resolutions and imposing more sanctions on Vladimir Putin.
*03:52.000- 03:56.040* :  But she says the world needs to be more innovative to deal with a man like him.
*03:56.040- 03:59.740* :  She said he wasn't a politician. She referred to him as a mobster.
*04:00.240- 04:05.580* :  Someone who would run a mob and says that it's only mafia money which is supporting him in his regime.
*04:05.580- 04:10.900* :  And it's through tackling that money and the wealth of those around him that actually some sort of
*04:10.900- 04:16.800* :  progress can be made. And ultimately the dream that her husband had and didn't get to see of a
*04:16.800- 04:22.000* :  different Russia, a beautiful Russia as she said it. It's only at that point could that dream be achieved.
*04:22.620- 04:27.960* :  And when she spoke about Putin must answer for what he's done to a neighboring peaceful country
*04:27.960- 04:33.680* :  speaking about Ukraine there. There's another reminder to European politicians that the money that
*04:33.880- 04:37.500* :  is forthcoming at the moment needs to carry on into the future.
*04:38.060- 04:41.580* :  Yeah, absolutely. I thought that was quite interesting. That was a comment quite near the end of
*04:41.580- 04:46.900* :  her speech. But she did refer to what was happening in Ukraine in the context that she said Vladimir
*04:46.900- 04:53.340* :  Putin had to be held responsible, held account and made to pay for what he had done to his own country,
*04:53.340- 04:58.060* :  electing a varnish, own country, Russia, but also what he'd done in Ukraine.
*04:58.060- 05:04.380* :  Choosing the word peaceful to talk about Ukraine as a victim in the full scale invasion of two
*05:04.380- 05:09.840* :  years ago. And also she said Vladimir Putin needs to be held accountable for what's happened to
*05:09.840- 05:14.760* :  the Navalny family. So she did mention that. And I think of course that will be fresh in the mind of
*05:14.760- 05:19.840* :  the politicians here in Strasbourg, but also in other parts of Europe. The fact that this call from
*05:19.840- 05:23.900* :  Ukraine is really loud and clear. We haven't got enough money. We haven't got enough weapons.
*05:23.900- 05:29.360* :  And you need to do a lot more if we are to defeat Vladimir Putin and push back the Russians from
*05:29.360- 05:36.240* :  Ukraine. Nick Beak. In recent years many political partners that take a hard line on immigration
*05:36.340- 05:41.620* :  have gained popularity. Well, today those parties in Europe at least are likely to look at new
*05:41.620- 05:48.940* :  research and say this backs up our concerns. 2023 saw a record increase in asylum claims in European
*05:48.940- 05:55.020* :  Union countries, up almost 18% to more than a million people. Nearly a third of them made their
*05:55.020- 06:01.440* :  bids in Germany, both Norway and Switzerland, which are not in the EU, saw a similar rise in
*06:01.440- 06:05.260* :  applications. I've been speaking to our Europe correspondent, Jessica Parker.
*06:05.880- 06:11.440* :  The report talks about the different nationalities coming here and some of the
*06:12.180- 06:18.440* :  list is not a surprise. So the highest number by far is Syrians coming to the EU and seeking
*06:18.460- 06:25.820* :  asylum, fleeing war, then followed by Afghans. Now that isn't very surprising. What is more
*06:25.820- 06:30.240* :  interesting, perhaps, or surprising if you crunch the numbers is actually Turkish nationals
*06:30.240- 06:37.320* :  lodged nearly 100,000 applications last year. Now that's up by 82% on the year before. And then
*06:37.320- 06:42.120* :  there's of course a long list of various nationalities, but those are the kind of some of the main
*06:42.840- 06:50.000* :  ones. So coming to the EU for different reasons and then seeking asylum here with various
*06:50.000- 06:56.060* :  success rates. But as you said, it's now a seven year high for the European Union and
*06:56.060- 07:00.400* :  including as well, Norway and Switzerland. So as you say, it will be something I think that
*07:00.400- 07:04.440* :  wild isn't a surprise because we knew that month by month the numbers were looking pretty high
*07:04.440- 07:10.920* :  for 2023. This is the first time we've seen that year round figure of what happened last year
*07:10.920- 07:17.500* :  from the EU asylum agency. And Jessica, these kind of figures will always stoke a lot of political
*07:17.500- 07:23.580* :  debate. In terms of that debate in Europe at the moment, is there a consensus about how to divvy
*07:23.580- 07:31.640* :  up these claims in a fair way? The EU did after lots of wrangling and sort of a long drawn out saga
*07:32.220- 07:39.700* :  reach a deal on a migration pact back in December. And what that's looking to do is to share
*07:39.700- 07:45.340* :  the distribution more fairly as some countries would see it. Those that feel that they get a
*07:45.340- 07:51.380* :  disproportionate number of applications. So share them based on GDP, expedite claim procedures.
*07:52.040- 07:56.980* :  And I guess this year will be a bit of a test as to I think the deal may still need a fewer
*07:57.120- 08:03.500* :  eyes dotting and tees crossing, but whether that actually works alongside efforts by individual
*08:03.500- 08:10.080* :  nations within the EU to strike bilateral deals, whether that is what Italy's been seeking to do
*08:10.080- 08:15.660* :  with Albania where they're trying to place asylum seekers or Germany striking return
*08:15.660- 08:22.540* :  deals with countries like Morocco. Jessica Parker in Berlin. Well, if increasing numbers of asylum
*08:22.540- 08:27.800* :  seekers and migrants is concerning some people in Europe, South Korea might be seen as having
*08:27.800- 08:33.380* :  the opposite problem. It has once again beaten its own record for the lowest birth rate in the world.
*08:33.380- 08:38.600* :  Despite billions spent encouraging women to have more children, the average expected in a lifetime
*08:38.600- 08:45.540* :  is now 0.72. And to put that number into perspective, it needs to be 2.1 to keep the total
*08:45.740- 08:51.380* :  population the same. Politicians have called this a national emergency. Our sole correspondent
*08:51.380- 08:58.180* :  Jean McKenzie sent this report. It's a rainy Tuesday and Yejin is cooking lunch for her friends
*08:58.180- 09:06.340* :  at her small apartment in Seoul. As they sit down to eat, one of them pulls up a meme of a dinosaur.
*09:07.340- 09:14.720* :  What is this cartoon saying? Be careful. Don't let yourself go extinct like us. The dinosaur says
*09:15.940- 09:22.140* :  it's funny, but it's dark. Says Yejin, a 30-year-old TV producer. We know we're causing our own
*09:22.140- 09:30.480* :  extinction. Neither she nor her friends are planning on having children. It's hard to find a
*09:30.500- 09:36.600* :  dateable man in Korea. One who'll share the chores and the childcare, she tells me. And so she's
*09:36.600- 09:41.740* :  decided to focus on her career, which doesn't leave enough time to raise a child anyway, she says.
*09:42.460- 09:50.300* :  Korean working hours are notoriously long. I love my job, but in Korea, you're stuck in a
*09:50.300- 09:56.060* :  perpetual cycle of work. We also have this mindset that if you don't continuously study outside
*09:56.160- 10:02.480* :  work, you're going to get left behind and become a failure. And this fear makes us work twice as hard.
*10:05.900- 10:10.260* :  I've come from an after-school club to meet Stella who teaches five-year-olds in English.
*10:12.240- 10:14.700* :  Look at the kids. They're so cute, she says.
*10:16.780- 10:20.440* :  My husband and I wanted a child, but we've both been so busy working.
*10:21.060- 10:26.600* :  Now I see that if I had a baby, I'd have to stop work for at least two years to look after it,
*10:27.160- 10:28.740* :  and I'd be very depressed stuck at home.
*10:31.700- 10:36.980* :  This expectation that women have to leave their jobs after having a child was common among
*10:36.980- 10:42.540* :  those I met, but even if Stella wanted to take time off, she says she couldn't afford to have a
*10:42.540- 10:48.780* :  child. In Korea, children are sent to expensive after-school classes, like the one Stella teaches,
*10:49.580- 10:52.940* :  and to opt out is seen as setting your child up to fail.
*10:57.980- 11:02.420* :  I wanted to get a mother's perspective, and so I come to meet Tong-Yong as she picks her two
*11:02.420- 11:03.720* :  young children up from school.
*11:13.880- 11:18.200* :  We tore playgrounds passing the hours until her husband gets back from work.
*11:18.920- 11:24.120* :  He's rarely home for bedtime. Tong-Yong is in what she calls a single parenting marriage.
*11:27.120- 11:32.020* :  At first, I felt so angry. I've been well-educated and told that women
*11:32.020- 11:34.520* :  were equal, so I couldn't accept this.
*11:36.820- 11:42.260* :  This sits at the heart of the problem. Over the past 50 years, Korea's economy has developed
*11:42.260- 11:47.980* :  at breakneck speed, propelling women into the workforce, but the roles of wife and mother
*11:48.320- 11:49.280* :  have barely evolved.
*11:51.200- 11:57.060* :  Now, I'm has the feelings of anger and regret. I just wish I'd known more about the
*11:57.060- 12:02.940* :  reality of raising kids and how much mothers are expected to do. The reason women aren't
*12:02.940- 12:07.240* :  having children now is because they are brave enough to talk about these things.
*12:12.720- 12:17.280* :  Back at the agency apartment, these women know Korea's birth rate is a problem,
*12:18.080- 12:19.920* :  but they don't feel it's theirs to solve.
*12:20.480- 12:22.160* :  Somebody else will solve that problem.
*12:23.700- 12:24.480* :  Next generation.
*12:25.100- 12:26.460* :  That report was by Jean McKenzie.
*12:27.740- 12:33.460* :  Around the world, 47 million women are estimated to begin the menopause every year,
*12:34.260- 12:37.640* :  often with profound effects on their physical and mental health.
*12:37.900- 12:42.500* :  For some women, the wide range of symptoms from hot flashes and trouble sleeping to depression
*12:42.500- 12:47.840* :  and memory problems can be managed through hormone replacement therapy or HRT,
*12:48.340- 12:51.520* :  but many women don't have access to the drugs or choose not to take them.
*12:51.900- 12:56.720* :  Now, new researchers found that some alternative therapies and even self-help techniques
*12:57.280- 12:58.300* :  can make a big difference.
*12:58.740- 13:01.860* :  Our health reporter, Orelia Foster, told us more about the findings.
*13:02.540- 13:06.440* :  Menopause, I'd say, can cause all sorts of very distressing symptoms,
*13:06.440- 13:07.860* :  physical and psychological.
*13:07.860- 13:13.400* :  And most studies that we've had in recent years have all been around hormone replacement therapy,
*13:14.840- 13:19.220* :  increasingly though, there's been more and more evidence coming through in recent years
*13:19.220- 13:26.040* :  that talking therapies, CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness do have real benefits
*13:26.040- 13:32.540* :  when it comes to things like low mood, feeling anxious and depressive symptoms that often come
*13:32.540- 13:36.400* :  along with menopause and a drop in hormone levels in the body.
*13:36.440- 13:41.720* :  And actually, they're widely used as a treatment for depression and anxiety in many countries already.
*13:42.280- 13:46.480* :  This study by University College London has taken data. It's a meta study.
*13:46.480- 13:51.800* :  So, it's looked at 30 studies done in recent years across 14 countries, the UK,
*13:51.820- 13:58.200* :  the United States, Iran, Australia, China, involving three and a half thousand women with
*13:58.200- 14:03.320* :  menopause or symptoms, looking at how things like CBT and mindfulness and other talking therapies
*14:03.320- 14:04.520* :  help those symptoms.
*14:05.140- 14:10.500* :  So, with CBT and mindfulness, there was a significant reduction in anxiety and depressive
*14:10.940- 14:16.400* :  symptoms, significant effects of CBT on memory and concentration, interestingly.
*14:16.940- 14:22.520* :  And CBT and mindfulness actually were found to improve overall quality of life in many women as well.
*14:22.960- 14:27.560* :  So, partly, this is about developing mental strategies, coping strategies, if you like,
*14:27.560- 14:32.080* :  and tackling cycles of negative thought which are key in low mood.
*14:32.700- 14:36.920* :  Also, though, the evidence suggests that these therapies aren't just about how you think,
*14:36.920- 14:41.440* :  but they could have some physical effects, especially to do with mindfulness.
*14:41.880- 14:44.100* :  So, that's relaxation techniques largely.
*14:44.740- 14:48.540* :  Some of the research has found in the past that these can help with hot flushes.
*14:48.540- 14:50.760* :  So, these can be very embarrassing for some women,
*14:51.220- 14:53.000* :  potentially make them feel very anxious.
*14:53.000- 14:57.060* :  And that anxiety could potentially cause further hot flushes.
*14:57.320- 15:01.680* :  There's also some research that practicing meditation can help sleep as well,
*15:01.680- 15:03.280* :  which has numerous benefits.
*15:03.880- 15:04.540* :  A Relia Foster.
*15:05.860- 15:09.880* :  The department store Macy's, which opened its first shop in 1858,
*15:09.880- 15:16.320* :  became one of the US's most famous brands and has been the go-to for fashion and beauty for years.
*15:16.940- 15:22.040* :  But the business has now announced plans to close 150 stores more than a fifth of its empire
*15:22.040- 15:25.820* :  over the next three years and focus more on luxury shopping instead.
*15:26.360- 15:31.360* :  Sam Fennick asked retail analyst Neil Saunders to give us his take on the news.
*15:32.260- 15:36.320* :  The X is cutting deep because Macy's really needs to get its house in order
*15:36.620- 15:39.360* :  in terms of optimizing the number of stores it has.
*15:39.880- 15:43.980* :  And that's very important because one of the other things that they want to do is invest
*15:43.980- 15:45.520* :  more in the stores that remain.
*15:46.160- 15:50.140* :  So, they don't want to put investment into stores that they don't really think have a future,
*15:50.140- 15:53.340* :  or that aren't going to deliver a return on that investment.
*15:53.840- 15:59.560* :  So, they're being very surgical and they're taking out stores that they just don't think
*15:59.560- 16:01.700* :  have a future in their portfolio.
*16:01.960- 16:03.680* :  And that is quite harsh.
*16:03.680- 16:04.760* :  It is a deep cut.
*16:04.760- 16:08.760* :  There's a lot of stores that are going to be closed as a result of this.
*16:09.260- 16:12.620* :  But arguably it's something that Macy's probably should have done before.
*16:12.620- 16:14.980* :  It just hasn't pruned as it's gone along.
*16:14.980- 16:20.240* :  So now we've got this massive wave of closures coming as Macy's tries to write size.
*16:20.880- 16:26.840* :  Online shopping compared to other markets has been in the past fairly immature in the US.
*16:26.840- 16:28.940* :  Is it finally starting to catch up?
*16:28.940- 16:34.500* :  Are the US consumers starting to really embrace it like European consumers are?
*16:35.420- 16:39.600* :  Yes, I think it's fair to say that the pandemic pushed a lot more people to shop online.
*16:39.780- 16:43.200* :  And online has become a much more significant part of the market.
*16:43.200- 16:46.860* :  It's not quite at the level in the US as it is in the UK.
*16:46.860- 16:49.440* :  For example, the UK is a very advanced market.
*16:49.440- 16:53.620* :  It's not at the level of China, which is another very advanced online market.
*16:54.080- 16:58.220* :  But it's certainly catching up and it's becoming a more significant part of retail.
*16:58.980- 17:04.040* :  That said, it's still important to remember that even in most categories and overall

*18:54.820- 18:59.240* :  The results are in for the presidential primaries in the US state of Michigan.
*18:59.800- 19:04.380* :  Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump easily won their respective elections.
*19:04.380- 19:10.020* :  And look set to face each other again as the Democrat and Republican nominees in November.
*19:10.560- 19:13.920* :  President Biden's win came despite a protest vote by Democrats.
*19:14.440- 19:18.200* :  Angry over his support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza,
*19:18.720- 19:20.980* :  as we heard from CBS reporter Jarrett Hill.
*19:21.560- 19:24.240* :  When it comes to his stance as the Democratic nominee,
*19:24.240- 19:26.260* :  this really doesn't make that big of a dent.
*19:26.420- 19:28.540* :  We though are talking about, at last,
*19:28.540- 19:32.900* :  check about 100 or so thousand people in the state of Michigan voting uncommitted.
*19:32.900- 19:37.080* :  Now, it's impossible to know at this point where all of them were uncommitted for those reasons
*19:37.080- 19:39.340* :  that we saw that the protest vote campaign.
*19:39.340- 19:41.240* :  But this is a pretty sizable number.
*19:41.240- 19:45.880* :  And this is not typical for that state in a primary election.
*19:45.880- 19:50.120* :  And so while President Biden has obviously won the state of Michigan here,
*19:50.120- 19:53.420* :  this is a chance for these protest voters to say,
*19:53.420- 19:58.340* :  we don't like what you're doing when it comes to Israel and Gaza and Hamas.
*19:58.820- 20:04.920* :  And we may not be there in November when you need us to vote for you for the general election.
*20:05.000- 20:09.140* :  So again, a lot to see here, how and if time changes some of that,
*20:09.140- 20:13.160* :  how and if the Biden campaign and administration change some of their efforts as well.
*20:13.160- 20:14.480* :  And so that's something to watch out for.
*20:14.620- 20:19.240* :  As things stand, do you think the uncommitted vote could swing the overall presidential race?
*20:19.980- 20:22.040* :  Not likely looking at the numbers again,
*20:22.040- 20:28.680* :  because this is only about 12% or so percent of the vote in the state of Michigan.
*20:29.040- 20:33.480* :  And while there is some question around whether there could be momentum for this type of movement
*20:33.480- 20:38.880* :  in some of the other states, at least at this point, it doesn't seem as though that would sway the vote.
*20:39.300- 20:41.620* :  That would be enough, potentially again, obviously,
*20:41.620- 20:44.700* :  depending on how many people turn out to vote for either candidate in November,
*20:45.160- 20:47.740* :  that it could be a sizable chunk.
*20:48.040- 20:52.440* :  But it doesn't at this point seem as though the majority of those uncommitted voters,
*20:52.440- 20:56.180* :  at least not in Michigan would go toward, let's say former President Trump,
*20:56.180- 20:58.240* :  if he ends up being the nominee for the Republicans.
*20:58.240- 21:02.400* :  But there is the question of whether this could be a moment of people staying home
*21:02.400- 21:03.720* :  and sitting out the vote altogether.
*21:04.500- 21:10.240* :  Jared Hill, as we heard there, the conflicting guards are continues to have political ramifications
*21:10.240- 21:11.300* :  around the world.
*21:11.340- 21:17.900* :  Here in Britain, it does as well, where the heated debate over whether or not politicians support a full ceasefire
*21:18.400- 21:21.520* :  has seen an increase in threats of violence to city MPs.
*21:22.020- 21:23.960* :  Such is the concern about their safety.
*21:23.960- 21:27.440* :  The British government has announced a multi-million dollar package
*21:27.860- 21:29.860* :  to improve the safety of MPs.
*21:29.860- 21:34.320* :  The policing minister, Chris Filp, said democracy needed to be protected.
*21:35.000- 21:42.320* :  We don't think that intimidation of publicly elected officials has any place in a civilised democracy.
*21:42.320- 21:47.320* :  Each MP needs to feel able, and in fact, councillors and elected mayors and police and crime commissioners,
*21:47.680- 21:52.300* :  need to be able to speak and vote as their consciences and their views dictate
*21:52.740- 21:55.760* :  without any kind of external intimidation.
*21:56.540- 22:00.800* :  Are political correspondent Rob Watson tell me more about the government's reasons for these measures?
*22:01.420- 22:06.000* :  They're being put in place now because of the spike in attacks since October 7th.
*22:06.000- 22:10.040* :  It's as simple as that, and although we haven't got precise facts and figures,
*22:10.040- 22:12.160* :  the police have been careful to keep that quiet.
*22:12.160- 22:15.160* :  We know that the threats of violence against members of Parliament,
*22:15.900- 22:19.960* :  councillors and local government, they have all been absolutely skyrocketing,
*22:19.960- 22:24.440* :  and we know that one MP has had their constituency office burned down,
*22:24.460- 22:28.520* :  and another one, of course, had what has been referred to as a mob outside his home,
*22:28.520- 22:32.800* :  so it's that upping, a massive increase in the threat level to politicians.
*22:33.100- 22:35.260* :  So Rob, what is being put in place for people?
*22:35.340- 22:36.580* :  All the sort of things you'd expect.
*22:36.740- 22:38.100* :  So first of all, there's more funding.
*22:38.100- 22:42.560* :  It's probably about $14 million, and it's things like bodyguards being made available.
*22:42.640- 22:44.500* :  I'm an extraordinary to just say it, Nick.
*22:44.820- 22:50.980* :  Bodyguards for MPs, surging police patrols in areas where there are dangers of community tension,
*22:51.400- 22:56.560* :  more provision of private security, so advice on things like cyber security to MPs,
*22:57.080- 23:00.300* :  a whole sort of slew of practical measures that you would expect,
*23:00.300- 23:05.260* :  and which sort of seem normal when you say them, but then shocking if you think about them.
*23:05.480- 23:10.160* :  And British MPs are particularly exposed because of the nature of the constituencies that they
*23:10.160- 23:14.220* :  meet people on a daily basis about local concerns, don't they?
*23:14.520- 23:19.860* :  Yes, and interestingly, all of the politicians are agreed about the fact that political
*23:19.860- 23:22.900* :  intimidation is a bad idea, a terrible thing.
*23:23.380- 23:26.660* :  All of them are agreed that you wouldn't want to change that phenomenon that you were just
*23:26.660- 23:32.280* :  talking about, the constituency system where most Thursdays and Fridays MPs are back in the 650
*23:32.280- 23:36.880* :  constituencies meeting their people in offices up and down the country.
*23:36.880- 23:40.560* :  But what's really been striking is that while they're agreed that you don't want intimidation,
*23:40.560- 23:44.240* :  you want to keep that openness, there's a lack of unity and political response.
*23:44.240- 23:46.660* :  And what I mean by that is that across the parties,
*23:47.340- 23:50.960* :  most British politicians would recognize the biggest terrorism threat in the UK
*23:50.960- 23:52.320* :  is from Islamic extremists.
*23:52.360- 23:56.720* :  There's also concern amongst the parties about the phenomenon of Islamism,
*23:56.800- 24:00.480* :  but rather than uniting, they haven't been able to resist that sort of
*24:01.000- 24:03.060* :  partisan desire to have a go at each other.
*24:03.060- 24:05.180* :  So, you know, you've got the conservative saying,
*24:05.180- 24:09.700* :  Labour is frightened to stand up to Islamic extremists and anti-Semitism,
*24:09.720- 24:11.840* :  because it's worried about upsetting Muslim voters,
*24:11.840- 24:15.480* :  and you've got Labour accusing the conservatives of Islamophobia,
*24:15.480- 24:17.360* :  because they want to stoke culture war.
*24:17.360- 24:19.600* :  So, yes, unity in terms of security,
*24:19.600- 24:24.560* :  but absolutely not unity in terms of political coming together and purpose.
*24:25.120- 24:28.920* :  Rob Watson, a former paramilitary leader in Colombia,
*24:28.920- 24:35.560* :  Salvatore Mancuso has been extradited from the US after serving a lengthy jail term for drug
*24:35.560- 24:42.660* :  trafficking. Mancuso, once the second in command of the right-wing AUC paramilitary group,
*24:42.720- 24:47.220* :  is accused of being involved in hundreds of murders and disappearances in Colombia.
*24:47.680- 24:51.700* :  He was flown to Bogota and handed over to the authorities in handcuffs,
*24:52.000- 24:53.800* :  and wearing a bullet proof vest.
*24:54.340- 24:58.060* :  Luis Fajardo, from BBC Monitoring in Miami, told us more about him.
*24:58.520- 25:03.600* :  Salvatore Mancuso has been an extraordinarily controversial figure in Colombian history.
*25:03.600- 25:08.120* :  He was a warlord from the right-wing paramilitaries,
*25:08.120- 25:12.520* :  as they were known in the late 20th century and early 21st century.
*25:13.120- 25:19.540* :  He was leader, actually, of a very powerful private army that fought communist guerrillas in Colombia,
*25:19.540- 25:25.840* :  and was responsible for thousands, literally thousands of very serious human rights violations.
*25:26.580- 25:33.140* :  Mancuso and the right-wing death squad that he was leading joined the peace talks with the
*25:33.140- 25:40.120* :  government of the time in the early 21st century, and eventually he was extradited to the United
*25:40.120- 25:46.440* :  States where he faced drug charges. He was convicted of drug trafficking, and he spent more than
*25:46.440- 25:52.680* :  a decade in the US prison. When he was finally released a few years ago, Mancuso, who is joined
*25:52.680- 25:59.400* :  Colombian and Italian national, he also tried to be sent to Italy, but the US government decided
*25:59.940- 26:04.180* :  that he was being sent to Colombia instead, and he has arrived in Colombia now.
*26:04.780- 26:05.880* :  What has likely happened to him?
*26:06.160- 26:13.620* :  Well, he has been received in a very substantial security operation. He's supposed to have almost a
*26:13.620- 26:19.060* :  wing of a prison, almost for himself, with many, many guards, many security measures,
*26:19.640- 26:25.460* :  because he also faces besides convictions, many, many criminal charges, literally for thousands of
*26:25.460- 26:31.240* :  homicides. So he would have to spend a lot of time in prison, but he is also working with the
*26:31.240- 26:36.180* :  Colombian government in a new peace process that is trying to incorporate other illegal
*26:36.180- 26:43.040* :  armed organizations in Colombia into a peace process. And because of such activities supported by
*26:43.040- 26:50.020* :  the government, he is expected to give testimony on what he has said was that cooperation of many
*26:50.020- 26:57.080* :  important business people and figures of the Colombian establishment, with that a violence that
*26:57.080- 27:02.700* :  happened 20 years ago with the Colombian right wing paramilitary groups. So there's a lot of
*27:02.700- 27:08.620* :  expectation of what he might be able to say besides the expectations of many, many victims of
*27:08.620- 27:13.720* :  these right wing paramilitary organizations that justice would finally come to them after many
*27:13.720- 27:14.480* :  years of waiting.
*27:15.120- 27:17.240* :  Have there been any reactions to his return home?
*27:17.800- 27:23.840* :  It has been the subject of immense criticism and immense controversy in Colombia. It is a very
*27:23.840- 27:30.700* :  painful subject and some people complain about the possibility that because of his collaboration
*27:30.700- 27:37.620* :  with the government in this process and because of his disposition to give testimony about
*27:37.620- 27:43.120* :  the alleged participation of many members of the establishment in these crimes, that he might
*27:43.120- 27:49.260* :  actually get a very, very substantial lenient treatment or even a sort of a pardon for his crimes
*27:49.260- 27:53.560* :  that he could actually walk free eventually in a relatively short time.
*27:54.040- 28:00.740* :  Luis Fajardo speaking to Beverly Oceane. The British fashion designer John Galliano is one of
*28:00.740- 28:06.120* :  the most successful names in the business but also one of the most controversial. In 2011,
*28:06.140- 28:11.660* :  he lost his job at the top of the door after a video emerged of him making an anti-Semitic and
*28:11.660- 28:17.620* :  racist outburst on the streets of Paris. And now the story of his chaotic career will be told
*28:17.620- 28:21.220* :  in a new documentary, the aptly titled High and Low.
*28:21.860- 28:26.300* :  Disgraced fashion designer John Galliano is in court today facing charges of anti-Semitic
*28:26.300- 28:30.160* :  behavior. You didn't apologise. You should be trade.
*28:31.220- 28:34.740* :  John Galliano is out of question. Do you or fear people here who are absolutely
*28:34.740- 28:39.440* :  disgusted by him? Can you tell me how you think you ended up in that place?
*28:42.380- 28:43.620* :  Yeah, I'm going to tell you everything.
*28:45.700- 28:51.000* :  Director of the documentary Kevin McDonald has been speaking to the BBC's Martha Carney.
*28:51.540- 28:56.560* :  He was always known as the on-fond terrible British fashion. His career started at St Martin's
*28:56.560- 29:01.840* :  Art School in the early 80s and I think over the next 10 years he won British fashion design
*29:01.840- 29:08.200* :  over the year three times. Each win was followed pretty quickly by a bankruptcy in his company's
*29:08.200- 29:14.640* :  kept going bankrupt. And then in 1994 he was made the first British designer to run a major
*29:14.640- 29:21.440* :  fashion label in France when he went to Dior and there he stayed for 15 years and he was
*29:21.440- 29:24.120* :  the biggest name in fashion really for all that period.
*29:24.480- 29:29.840* :  But throughout that time his self-destruction, his self-destructive instincts got worse
*29:29.840- 29:36.340* :  and worse didn't they until it ended up with that drunken anti-Semitic tirade. And one of
*29:36.340- 29:40.400* :  the clever things about the film I watched it last night is in my own mind I was going backwards and
*29:40.400- 29:44.340* :  forwards about whether I thought he was anti-Semitic or not. I wondered whether you reached any
*29:44.340- 29:49.100* :  conclusion. Well in a way you as the audience member know as much as I do because you're seeing
*29:49.100- 29:55.120* :  really the evidence that there is pro and con him as you sort of listen to people on his side
*29:55.120- 30:00.740* :  talking about it and those people include Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and then you have people
*30:00.740- 30:04.980* :  who are the victims of this abuse talking who have not forgiven him for what happened.
*30:05.580- 30:09.160* :  Personally I don't think he's anti-Semitic. I don't think in any way he's ideologically
*30:09.160- 30:14.560* :  anti-Semitic. I think he's the most unpolitical person you could imagine. I think he was deeply
*30:14.560- 30:20.580* :  self-destructive. He was a terrible addict. I think he still is an addict and maybe the explanation
*30:20.620- 30:25.940* :  is that he was trying to destroy himself so that the whole the train would stop as it was you know
*30:26.080- 30:29.620* :  running at a hundred miles an hour towards a brick wall. He was definitely on his way to killing
*30:29.620- 30:34.620* :  himself and this was a way maybe to to save himself a cry for help as soon as you might say.
*30:34.920- 30:40.620* :  But how much has he really gone into what he did wrong because there's a telling moment in the film
*30:41.080- 30:47.120* :  where you say to him there were two racist incidents. Three in fact. And he, sorry there were three
*30:47.120- 30:50.960* :  in the end yet but he he looks to go no there was only one there was only one and he didn't seem
*30:50.960- 30:56.840* :  to quite realise what he'd done. Yeah it is an extraordinary moment isn't it and it's kind of what I
*30:56.840- 31:00.560* :  love about documentaries. You never really know what's going on inside people's heads. Why would he
*31:00.560- 31:06.260* :  say that? He must remember that. He was taken to trial in France over these antisemitic incidents.
*31:06.920- 31:10.680* :  And my explanation is I don't think he can be trying to just pull the wool over my eyes. He'd be
*31:10.680- 31:14.780* :  pretty naive to do that. I think probably what he's doing is he's in denial. He's created a story
*31:14.780- 31:21.080* :  a narrative that allows him to live with himself and a narrative which he can trot out and tell
*31:21.080- 31:25.660* :  people that makes him maybe not sound so bad. And certainly convinced the fashion world just
*31:25.660- 31:31.460* :  briefly he's had an astonishing new show. Yeah his latest show is on a month ago in Paris is being
*31:31.460- 31:36.280* :  hailed as the best fashion show of the millennium. It's extraordinary so yeah he's
*31:36.520- 31:43.820* :  bowed but undefeated. Kevin McDonald. The sustain chapel in Vatican City is considered one of the
*31:43.820- 31:50.600* :  finest examples of high Renaissance art. It's walls and ceiling adorned with Michelangelo frescoes
*31:50.820- 31:56.900* :  but the draw of its beauty has been its undoing it seems. Six million tourists visit every year
*31:57.380- 32:02.220* :  and they're having a big impact on the artworks. The BBC went behind the scenes to meet the small
*32:02.220- 32:14.100* :  team of experts protecting them. Saramoneta reports. A stand crowd slowly paces on the inlet marble floor,
*32:14.140- 32:20.580* :  their eyes on the vault, their mouths half opened in amazement. The system chapel is part of one
*32:20.580- 32:27.200* :  of the most visited museums in the world up to 25,000 tourists a day but that comes at a price.
*32:29.960- 32:36.100* :  So for a few weeks over here after the last visit he's gone experts get to work. If you imagine
*32:36.380- 32:43.320* :  thousands of people contemporary present in the chapel this means that the humidity
*32:43.320- 32:51.040* :  increases and also the carbon dioxide and this reacts with the surface of the work of art.
*32:51.220- 32:57.460* :  Francesca Prasagat is the head of the painting lab at the Vatican Museums. We may have condensation
*32:58.120- 33:06.920* :  is like water on the surface dust deposit because dust means also dangerous compounds.
*33:09.660- 33:14.020* :  Coming onto a crane operated from the ground Francesca is lifted high up under the
*33:14.020- 33:19.920* :  vault just a few centimetres away from the image of Jesus who is in his arm. She and her team are
*33:19.920- 33:24.280* :  inspecting the scene of the last judgment to spot any signs of deterioration.
*33:24.280- 33:31.720* :  We have here some alterations, some light whiteening, now we need to understand what caused it.
*33:34.780- 33:38.940* :  At the opposite end of the chapel experts on a scaffolding are taking high-resolution
*33:38.940- 33:44.380* :  photos to map sections of the frescoes. Fabio Morezi is the head of the scientific lab.
*33:45.020- 33:51.040* :  He shows me a stunningly detailed close-up of a character inside of a fresco. It's a self portrait
*33:51.040- 33:57.640* :  of Perugino, the author of the scene. To get these details we took 20 separate photos and we
*33:57.640- 34:02.940* :  piece them back together to obtain this extremely high-resolution image. At such high resolution
*34:03.060- 34:08.740* :  we can see down the single paint crystal and this allows us to see over time if there have been
*34:08.740- 34:16.540* :  changes or dust deposits. After the last restoration 30 years ago sensors and an air conditioning
*34:16.540- 34:22.020* :  system were installed to keep a stable environment in the chapel but since then the number of visitors
*34:22.020- 34:31.940* :  has soared, requiring more intensive maintenance. Last year we closed our 2023 with nearly 7 million
*34:31.940- 34:37.840* :  people in a year. Parbarayata is the director of the Vatican Museums. It's an important mission
*34:37.840- 34:44.380* :  to be an open house. It's exactly what Pope Francis is asking to us and it's exactly the line in
*34:44.420- 34:51.420* :  which we are going trying to balance of course they were coming with the preservation of our
*34:51.800- 34:59.420* :  incredible collections about our surrounding us. It's a fine line to ensure that present and
*34:59.420- 35:05.800* :  future generations will still be able to gasp in awe every time they look up and Michelangelo's must-a-piece.
*35:07.540- 35:09.400* :  Sarah Maneta at the Sistine Chapel.
