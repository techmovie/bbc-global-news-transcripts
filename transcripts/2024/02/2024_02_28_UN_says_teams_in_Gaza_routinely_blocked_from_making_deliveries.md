*01:35.720- 01:38.960* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:41.720- 01:46.240* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 28th of February, these are our main
*01:46.240- 01:52.140* :  stories. UNA agencies say their teams in Gaza are being routinely attacked and blocked from
*01:52.140- 01:58.440* :  making deliveries. The United States, Germany and other key NATO nations have ruled out a
*01:58.440- 02:02.300* :  suggestion from the French president that their troops could be sent to Ukraine.
*02:03.440- 02:08.700* :  Oil leaking from a capsized barge off the coast of Tobago has spread hundreds of kilometers
*02:09.020- 02:11.020* :  to the Caribbean island of Bonheir.
*02:14.200- 02:19.240* :  Also in this podcast, there is a long way to go and this is only the first step but what a
*02:19.240- 02:24.060* :  successful step this has been. Campaigners welcome in order to rebuild Britain's
*02:24.120- 02:28.840* :  wonkiest pub after it burnt down last year in a suspected arson attack.
*02:33.380- 02:38.080* :  We start in the Middle East where Hamas has played down hopes that a cease-fire in the war in
*02:38.080- 02:43.760* :  Gaza could be agreed soon. President Biden had said he hoped to pause in the fighting would begin
*02:43.760- 02:50.040* :  as soon as Monday but Hamas officials have indicated that negotiations are not as advanced as Mr
*02:50.040- 02:56.700* :  Biden suggested. Israel has not commented. This comes as UNA agencies say Israeli forces are
*02:56.700- 03:02.020* :  systematically preventing them from helping the many displaced and desperate people in Gaza.
*03:02.720- 03:08.840* :  Jens Leica is a UN spokesman in Geneva. He had this to say regarding the evacuation of wounded
*03:08.840- 03:16.420* :  patients from Al Amal Hospital in Karnunis. The Israeli forces blocked the WHO-led convoy for many
*03:16.420- 03:22.360* :  hours the moment it left the hospital. The Israeli military forced patients and staff out of
*03:22.360- 03:28.440* :  ambulances and stripped all paramedics off their clothes. Three Palestinian-red-crested society
*03:28.440- 03:34.540* :  paramedics were subsequently detained although their personal details had been shared with the
*03:34.540- 03:39.820* :  Israeli forces in advance while the rest of the convoy stayed in place for over seven hours.
*03:40.360- 03:46.040* :  The Israeli defence forces issued a statement in response to the UN claims. They said that the IDF
*03:46.080- 03:51.280* :  checked the identity of people in the convoy following intelligence there might be terrorists
*03:51.400- 03:56.620* :  there and that the two red crescent members were arrested for further investigation.
*03:57.880- 04:02.340* :  Even before this some aid deliveries into Gaza had already been suspended because of
*04:03.300- 04:08.260* :  the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Yan Egelan, arrived in Gaza on Tuesday.
*04:08.300- 04:12.440* :  He told us what he'd witnessed in the southernmost city, Raffa.
*04:12.860- 04:19.700* :  A truck's going full speed down the road as youngsters are jumping on top of them and
*04:19.700- 04:28.840* :  looting whatever they can get hold of to the crowds around whereas shots are fired in the air
*04:28.840- 04:37.400* :  by these plain clothes policemen who are now trying to provide order but of course the blue
*04:37.400- 04:45.080* :  police was bombed by the Israelis and now there is little order a lot of chaos and a lot of
*04:45.080- 04:51.780* :  desperation. I got more on this from our correspondent in Jerusalem Paul Adams but first he gave us this
*04:51.780- 04:58.500* :  assessment of the chances of a ceasefire deal. I think the chances are still there. I think this is
*04:58.500- 05:04.180* :  something that is approaching perhaps. It's clear that Joe Biden is trying to force the pace,
*05:04.180- 05:09.060* :  trying to make sure that this ceasefire deal is put in place before the start of Ramadan in less
*05:09.060- 05:15.040* :  than two weeks time but there are obviously still plenty of differences and Qatar which has played a
*05:15.040- 05:22.080* :  key role in brokering these talks says that there's no breakthrough yet and Hamas publicly at least
*05:22.080- 05:27.980* :  is sticking to its demands. It wants a permanent ceasefire and the total withdrawal of Israeli troops
*05:28.380- 05:33.200* :  from the Gaza Strip. Those are two things that the Israeli government is absolutely not going to
*05:33.200- 05:39.820* :  do. Prime Minister Netanyahu has called those demands delusional. Has Hamas softened its position?
*05:39.820- 05:46.540* :  We don't know but you know there are a number of issues to do with the prisoners, the hostages,
*05:47.260- 05:52.880* :  whether Palestinians will be allowed to return to their homes, how the desperate humanitarian
*05:52.880- 05:59.220* :  situation in the Gaza Strip will be addressed. All of these things have to be sorted out if this
*05:59.220- 06:04.060* :  deal is to work at all. You talk about a desperate humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and we've
*06:04.060- 06:08.800* :  heard some very strong words today from UN agencies. They're saying that they've been systematically
*06:08.800- 06:15.500* :  prevented from carrying out their work in Gaza by Israeli forces even talking about their staff being
*06:15.500- 06:21.880* :  attacked. Yeah we've had quite a few reports of that kind in the last few weeks. The situation is
*06:22.060- 06:29.040* :  that the security situation in the Gaza Strip has deteriorated so dramatically. The places become
*06:29.040- 06:35.020* :  so lawless, full of looting gangs, some of it organized, some of it sort of individual ad hoc
*06:35.020- 06:41.480* :  looting and stealing of aid, that it is essentially impossible for the agencies to run a properly
*06:41.480- 06:47.920* :  organized humanitarian relief effort. And when you bear in mind the sheer scale of the requirements
*06:47.920- 06:55.100* :  in terms of health and food and shelter, then it's a monumental task. The Israelis say they have
*06:55.100- 07:00.000* :  no problem with hundreds of trucks going into the Gaza Strip. They say the problems are all on the
*07:00.000- 07:07.000* :  Palestinian side, but it is that complete breakdown of law and order caused absolutely directly by
*07:07.000- 07:11.760* :  Israel's military campaign over the past four and a half months that has got us to where we are.
*07:11.920- 07:18.320* :  And Egypt's Air Force has talked about dropping 45 tons of aid into northern and central
*07:18.740- 07:24.820* :  Gaza. Is this a solution because we're particularly hearing about starvation even famine in northern
*07:24.820- 07:29.820* :  Gaza? Air drops are not a solution to anything. They're just a band-aid. They're kind of symbolic.
*07:29.820- 07:34.000* :  For aid to be effective it has to be delivered on the ground. It has to be delivered by trucks
*07:34.560- 07:39.500* :  along roads. You know they can kind of keep hospitals here and there going. The Jordanians have
*07:39.500- 07:45.600* :  done that with their air drops, but ultimately we need to see hundreds of trucks rolling safely
*07:45.600- 07:53.300* :  into the Gaza Strip in order to reverse this very rapid decline in the humanitarian situation in
*07:53.300- 08:00.300* :  Gaza. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Well nearly five months into the war in Gaza civilians are still
*08:00.300- 08:06.740* :  living with acute hunger and the constant fear of bombardment. The BBC has been following a day in
*08:06.740- 08:11.320* :  the life of three gardens, a child in Raffa in the south where there are more than a million
*08:11.320- 08:17.940* :  displaced people, a grandmother in De Al-Bala in the centre of Gaza and a doctor working in a hospital
*08:17.940- 08:23.280* :  in Gaza City in the north. This report from our special correspondent Fergokin.
*08:31.000- 08:36.420* :  I want my dad. Where is my dad? The little girl is being carried in the arms of a rescue
*08:36.420- 08:43.280* :  worker behind them a devastated building body still trapped under the rubble. Israel hunts for the
*08:43.280- 08:53.100* :  Hamas attackers who killed and kidnapped its citizens and grief follows for the civilians pushed
*08:53.100- 09:02.020* :  from place to place always losing. On this the 144th day of the war children are queuing sometimes
*09:02.020- 09:09.100* :  jostling for the poultry rations still provided by local charities. But in the daily life of Gaza
*09:09.100- 09:16.000* :  resilience determination is the hallmark of many refugee children. In the family tent on the street
*09:16.000- 09:21.380* :  in Raffa 12-year-old Malak Al-Darabi helps to cook crisps made from whatever little flower
*09:21.380- 09:27.080* :  her mother can spare. Then Malak goes out into the streets for the day, selling the crisps to
*09:27.080- 09:31.280* :  raise money for medicine for her mother and brother who both have lung infections.
*09:32.860- 09:38.840* :  Before we had a normal life our dad used to bring us what we needed and we used to play and go
*09:38.840- 09:48.540* :  to school and learn not like now. Further north in De Al-Bala Samira Nourala age 65 a grandmother
*09:49.120- 09:55.040* :  is taking care of nine children among thousands of refugees at a school building managed by the UN.
*09:56.980- 10:01.820* :  On our journalist for spoke to Nourala back in November she was also taking care of her husband
*10:01.820- 10:08.360* :  Muhammad Abu Al-Khair who was seriously ill suffering from the effects of a stroke and lying
*10:08.360- 10:16.240* :  on the bear concrete. He died in the same place. Like everyone Nourala is hungry constantly looking
*10:16.240- 10:26.420* :  for food and fearful of violent death. We are constantly terrified like in a movie. Every night
*10:26.420- 10:33.740* :  we sleep in fear trying to assure our children telling them not to be scared. I'm talking to you
*10:33.900- 10:44.120* :  and the drone is flying above us. At the northern end of the Gaza Strip Dr. Muhammad Al-Sheikh
*10:44.380- 10:49.420* :  is attending to a badly wounded man lying on the floor just inside the entrance to Al-Shifa
*10:49.420- 10:55.920* :  hospital in Gaza City. The doctor is in his thirties. He says he's only left the hospital twice
*10:55.920- 11:04.440* :  in the past four months. We're working 24-7. We don't go to our homes as Dr. Muhammad. We're
*11:04.440- 11:10.260* :  disconnected from our families. All the volunteers and medical staff stay in the same room. As far as
*11:10.260- 11:19.220* :  food goes only a few items are available. We provide whatever we can. By the day's end as darkness
*11:19.220- 11:26.240* :  covered Gaza, Dr. Muhammad Al-Shifa, Nourala in her refugee camp, and young Malak, the street
*11:26.240- 11:32.440* :  cellar of Rafa, prepared for another night of fear. While beyond the border of the siege,
*11:32.540- 11:41.300* :  men were talking of a ceasefire. That report by Furgle King. The war in Gaza appears to be having
*11:41.300- 11:47.320* :  an impact on US politics in a crucial election year with President Biden expected to again face
*11:47.320- 11:53.140* :  off against Donald Trump. With polls showing the election could be close, experts say Michigan
*11:53.140- 12:00.200* :  is a must-win state for Mr. Biden. But it also has the largest Arab American population in the US,
*12:00.200- 12:06.860* :  and many people there have been deeply angered by his staunch support of Israel. The state is
*12:06.860- 12:12.940* :  holding its primary elections to choose presidential candidates. In the Democratic primary, voters
*12:12.940- 12:19.380* :  angry about the devastation in Gaza were urged to tick uncommitted on the ballot paper rather than
*12:19.380- 12:25.200* :  back Mr. Biden. In the Republican race, Donald Trump is expected to inflict another defeat on his
*12:25.200- 12:31.340* :  only remaining rival, Nikki Haley. A US correspondent John Sudworth has more details.
*12:32.020- 12:37.860* :  Michigan presents Joe Biden with the first test of how much his backing for Israel's war against
*12:37.860- 12:45.340* :  Hamas is costing him support among his Democrat base in a key swing state. As the incumbent,
*12:45.340- 12:50.980* :  the president's expected to comfortably win the nomination, but campaigners are urging voters
*12:51.380- 12:58.460* :  in a state with a sizable Arab American population to tick a box marked uncommitted as an act of
*12:58.460- 13:03.740* :  protest. The Democrat's strategist and spokesman for the Listen to Michigan Movement,
*13:03.740- 13:11.060* :  Abu Salawir, isn't swayed by arguments that by undermining Mr. Biden, he'll simply boost Donald
*13:11.060- 13:15.480* :  Trump. A world where Donald Trump is present again is not a world that I want to live in. We're
*13:15.480- 13:20.000* :  sending a message to President Biden today by going out to the polls as a way of applying
*13:20.000- 13:25.660* :  of pressure on President Biden to stop the war. In the Republican primary, the former president
*13:25.660- 13:31.760* :  has been busy rallying his base, still promoting the falsehood of a stolen election and issuing
*13:31.760- 13:37.400* :  dark warnings about American decline. And the whole country is falling apart and criminals are
*13:37.400- 13:42.780* :  moving into our country and I'll get it all stopped and I'll get it done fast. So vote for Trump.
*13:42.780- 13:47.320* :  I love Michigan. We're going to bring your jobs back. But once again, it's not the predicted
*13:47.320- 13:54.000* :  win over his challenger, Nikki Haley, that matters so much as the margin. If he's to take back the
*13:54.000- 13:59.640* :  White House, he'll need more than just his base and the support of moderate Republicans in places
*13:59.640- 14:06.500* :  like Michigan will be vital. John Sudworth. Key NATO allies, including two of Ukraine's biggest
*14:06.500- 14:11.460* :  military backers, the US and Germany, have rebuffed a suggestion from the French President
*14:11.460- 14:16.940* :  that Western troops could be sent to Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron was speaking at a hastily
*14:16.940- 14:22.220* :  convened meeting of European leaders in Paris, looking at ways of boosting flagging support
*14:22.220- 14:29.140* :  for Ukraine. But many of the leaders rejected putting boots on the ground. The German deputy
*14:29.140- 14:35.540* :  chancellor Robert Heybeck suggested that France should focus on sending weapons now rather than
*14:35.540- 14:45.180* :  proposing a move that could further escalate the conflict. I'm glad that France is considering
*14:45.180- 14:52.760* :  how to strengthen support for Ukraine, but can I suggest something? Send more weapons. Do what you
*14:52.760- 15:00.000* :  can do now and give Ukraine the ammunition and tanks that can be sent right now. This now really
*15:00.000- 15:05.920* :  is the point where you can't abandon Ukraine. Russia's response to the French President's suggestion
*15:06.020- 15:10.720* :  was to say that Western troops in Ukraine would make conflict with NATO inevitable.
*15:11.360- 15:16.380* :  A correspondent in Berlin, Jessica Parker, told us Mr. Macron's comments have sparked irritation
*15:17.340- 15:23.120* :  in Germany. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, I think seemed quite eager to comment on this today,
*15:23.120- 15:27.480* :  because not only did he speak to reporters, he also sent out a tweet even in English
*15:27.480- 15:34.660* :  to say that no troops from Europe or NATO would be going to Ukraine. And that is the established
*15:34.660- 15:40.880* :  position, but one that Emmanuel Macron made some remarks that has raised eyebrows and actually
*15:40.880- 15:45.820* :  caused, I'd say, some alarm here in Germany. It's certainly very prominent in the news bulletins.
*15:46.120- 15:50.120* :  He'd been meeting with other EU leaders talking about support for Ukraine, which, of course,
*15:50.120- 15:55.200* :  principally focuses from an EU perspective on economic support, but also nations provide
*15:55.200- 15:59.240* :  military aid as well. And in fact, Germany is the one that provides the most military aid.
*15:59.800- 16:04.360* :  In Europe, it isn't just Olaf Scholz that has been quick to say that ain't going to happen.
*16:04.360- 16:10.160* :  There have also been comments from Madrid to that effect from Italy as well, from Hungary,
*16:10.160- 16:14.140* :  although that wouldn't be a surprise from Hungary given a Prime Minister Victor Orbán's
*16:14.140- 16:19.720* :  prior positions on the war in Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But it is a slightly
*16:19.720- 16:23.640* :  unfortunate mismatch in terms of communication, particularly between France and Germany,
*16:23.640- 16:28.920* :  Europe's two biggest powers. And I do sense perhaps a bit of irritation here in Berlin that
*16:28.920- 16:33.560* :  Emmanuel Macron has made those remarks, because as I mentioned before, Germany is Ukraine's
*16:33.560- 16:38.300* :  biggest backer in terms of military aid behind the United States, whereas France lags quite
*16:38.300- 16:43.700* :  some way behind that. So one diplomat, European diplomat, I was speaking to earlier,
*16:44.180- 16:48.660* :  felt that this was a bit of grandstanding by Emmanuel Macron talking tough without actually
*16:48.660- 16:51.860* :  supplying as many weapons, for example, as countries like Germany.
*16:52.780- 16:58.420* :  Just a good parker in Berlin. As we heard in the earlier podcast, a veteran Russian human rights
*16:58.420- 17:03.640* :  campaigner has become the latest critic of President Putin and his war in Ukraine to be put behind
*17:03.640- 17:09.600* :  bars. Oleg Olaf was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. He'd been found guilty of
*17:09.600- 17:14.060* :  discrediting the Russian army because of his protests against the invasion of Ukraine and his
*17:14.060- 17:20.600* :  accusations that Mr. Putin was in his words, leading at a cent in defascism. Mr. Olaf co-founded
*17:20.600- 17:25.660* :  the Human Rights Group Memorial, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.
*17:26.540- 17:32.360* :  Video footage from the courtroom showed the 70-year-old activists smiling and waving, despite being
*17:32.360- 17:41.380* :  handcuffed, he delivered defiant reaction to his sentence. I don't consider myself to be alone.
*17:41.700- 17:48.240* :  I'm part of a large team, both the Memorial Human Rights Centre and more broadly. We live in the
*17:48.240- 17:55.100* :  21st century. The Russian authorities are going backwards, back to the 16th and 17th centuries,
*17:55.400- 18:01.160* :  and unfortunately they're dragging our country with them, but victory will still be ours.
*18:01.880- 18:06.080* :  With more, Mr. Olaf's sentencing, here's our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*18:06.640- 18:12.020* :  Oleg, Olaf is a veteran human rights campaign and one of the most prominent in Russia.
*18:12.560- 18:17.980* :  He was put on trial last year, in fact, for the same charges of repeatedly discrediting
*18:18.400- 18:23.680* :  the Russian armed forces through his public criticism of the war in Ukraine. He was found guilty
*18:23.680- 18:29.620* :  last year. He was just given a fine. There was no prison sentence. Prosecutors had said last year,
*18:29.920- 18:35.860* :  well that's far too lenient, a re-trial was ordered, which has concluded today with a much
*18:35.860- 18:43.080* :  tougher sentence. Mr. Olaf being sent to prison for two and a half years. And yes, you said that he
*18:43.080- 18:48.160* :  was sounding defiant, but I have to say, out on the street, a very different mood. Some of his
*18:48.160- 18:54.960* :  supporters had gathered outside the Moscow courthouse, and they were very quiet. They were downhearted.
*18:55.680- 19:01.300* :  The mood was very somber. Almost a sense of helplessness, I think, about the future of civil
*19:01.300- 19:08.720* :  society in Russia. One thing is clear, that these are very dark times for opponents of the
*19:08.720- 19:13.900* :  Kremlin, for people who do not agree with the direction in which Russia is moving. We have the
*19:13.900- 19:20.820* :  recent death in prison of Mr. Levyni. We have Mr. Olaf being sent to prison. We have other
*19:21.480- 19:28.100* :  Russian opposition leaders in prison or who fled into exile. So I think there is a sense of helplessness
*19:28.100- 19:33.840* :  here amongst Russians that part of society who believes that Russia should be taking a different
*19:33.840- 19:37.960* :  path. Not everyone in this country agrees with that. There are some people, of course, who support
*19:37.960- 19:43.960* :  Vladimir Putin, but amongst liberals, people who want democracy at these are very dark times.
*19:44.860- 19:50.200* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. Now, a Spanish galleon that was sunk by the British in the Caribbean
*19:50.200- 19:56.780* :  Sea near Colombia more than three centuries ago has been described as the holy grail of shipwrecks.
*19:57.220- 20:02.280* :  That's because of the treasure thought to be on board, including gold and silver coins and
*20:02.280- 20:09.160* :  emeralds. Its value has been estimated to be as high as 20 billion dollars. But before the treasure
*20:09.160- 20:15.460* :  is hoisted up from the ocean floor, arguments are raging already over who it belongs to. Colombia
*20:15.460- 20:21.300* :  knows where the ship is and is investing in exploring it. Evan Davis spoke to Dan Snow,
*20:21.300- 20:25.420* :  presenter of the history hit podcast, who told him more about the shipwreck.
*20:45.500- 20:53.200* :  That gets on mules down to effectively Lima today, up to Panama across the Ifsmus of Panama,
*20:53.200- 20:57.960* :  no canal back then, and then has to be trans shipped into Colombia and then off to Europe.
*20:58.240- 21:02.420* :  At various stages, it's extraordinarily long journey, various paratical people, usually
*21:02.420- 21:06.760* :  Englishmen and Brits, so for example, France's Drake had a pop at that. For various times in our
*21:06.760- 21:13.660* :  history, we've had a go at various key nodes along that route. This is a rare example of successful
*21:13.680- 21:18.700* :  interception, tragically for the Brits involved, Admiral Wager. He actually blew this ship up.
*21:19.300- 21:23.520* :  You mentioned it was in battle in 1708. They were trying to capture it, but there was a catastrophic
*21:23.520- 21:28.160* :  explosion when its powder supply ignited. Nearly everyone on board was killed, about 600 men killed,
*21:28.580- 21:34.620* :  and it sank in about 100 meters of water, about 600 meters of water. So it was out of the
*21:34.620- 21:38.760* :  cultures of the Brits, but it's always sat there and no one could get to it.
*21:38.920- 21:44.420* :  Now look, damn, interesting question, and you're not a lawyer, you're a historian, but nevertheless
*21:44.420- 21:51.080* :  give us a go at this. Who's is that gold? Well, your disclaimer is precisely correct.
*21:51.080- 21:56.100* :  I'm not a lawyer, so everyone can put down their legal pads, but this is really problematic.
*21:56.980- 22:01.840* :  We don't first, we don't know where it is. There is a convention that military ship,
*22:01.960- 22:06.300* :  right? Typically less than a result, but older nations, obviously like the Brits, the Americans,
*22:06.300- 22:10.800* :  the Spanish, so it should go back more than 100 years. Typically a warship
*22:11.560- 22:20.080* :  is remains the jurisdiction of the Rex, so-called flag state, but that would be Spain saying it's
*22:20.080- 22:24.440* :  ours. That would be Spain, and it also depends on who it is. If it's 12 miles offshore, that's kind of
*22:24.520- 22:28.420* :  you know, territorial area. It's 200 miles or certain economic activities that you can
*22:28.820- 22:35.020* :  claim in court. Beyond that, the deep sea bed is common to all mankind. Historian Dan Snow.
*22:37.940- 22:43.080* :  Still to come, a bitter blow to South Africa's attempts to save its rhinos from extinction
*22:43.080- 22:49.700* :  with 500 killed last year. Now that the country and international travel has started up again,
*22:49.700- 22:53.000* :  the poaching curve is going in the wrong direction again.
*22:58.540- 23:04.720* :  For just as long as Hollywood has been tinseltown, there have been suspicions about what lurks behind
*23:04.720- 23:11.560* :  the glitz and glamour. And for a while, those suspicions grew into something much bigger and much
*23:11.560- 23:16.100* :  darker. Are you a member of the Communist Party? Or have you ever been a member of the Communist

*24:13.660- 24:19.140* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Oil that leaked from a vessel that capsized off the coast
*24:19.140- 24:25.080* :  of Tobago three weeks ago has now reached the Caribbean island of Bonheir, 800 kilometers away.
*24:25.700- 24:31.040* :  Residents are mobilizing to protect beaches and mangroves, but several areas have already been
*24:31.040- 24:37.180* :  contaminated. Our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia reports. The authorities in Bonheir
*24:37.180- 24:42.660* :  a special municipality of the Netherlands say the oil poses a serious threat to humans in nature.
*24:43.120- 24:48.040* :  They said the island's east coast had been affected and warned that mangrove fish and coral
*24:48.040- 24:54.080* :  ecosystems were at risk. The barge was abandoned by its crew after hitting a reef near the southern
*24:54.080- 25:00.120* :  coast of Tobago. It's still unclear who owns it. The government of Trinidad in Tobago says the leak
*25:00.120- 25:05.560* :  remains unplugged and oil continues to spread to other islands across the Caribbean Sea.
*25:07.680- 25:13.120* :  South Africa is home to most of the world's rhinos, majestic animals whose numbers have been
*25:13.120- 25:18.760* :  decimated by poachers. Now in its long-running battle to save the rhinos from extinction,
*25:18.760- 25:25.280* :  South Africa has suffered a blow. Last year nearly 500 rhinos were killed by poachers despite
*25:25.280- 25:31.480* :  tight security at parks like Kruger. That's an increase of more than 10% on the previous year.
*25:32.140- 25:36.940* :  Our southern Africa correspondent Shingai Ayaka told us more about the significance of these
*25:36.940- 25:45.820* :  figures. 499 rhinos poached. That's 51 more than in 2022, but I think significantly 300 of those
*25:45.820- 25:51.200* :  were at a single game park. The Luflu were in Foulosie, which is a state-run reserve,
*25:51.700- 25:56.620* :  and it's actually considered one of Africa's oldest. That isn't the province of Kwa-Zulu-Natal.
*25:57.240- 26:03.940* :  Just over 90 were poached at private game parks, but I think the significance is that over the
*26:03.940- 26:10.640* :  last few years, poaching numbers had gone down or had been decreasing because of the COVID pandemic
*26:10.640- 26:16.260* :  and all of those restrictions. But I think what it shows now is that now that the country and
*26:16.260- 26:21.600* :  international travel has started up again, the poaching curve is going in the wrong direction again,
*26:21.600- 26:26.620* :  but it's not all negative because further north and Kruger National Park, where authorities
*26:26.620- 26:32.900* :  have tightened the security around the park. It's helped to lower the poaching incidents by almost
*26:32.900- 26:39.820* :  40% there, so it shows that with investment, with tighter security, it is possible to reverse those
*26:39.820- 26:47.060* :  numbers. And just remind us why poachers focus so much on rhinos? Well, essentially it's because
*26:47.060- 26:56.300* :  the rhino horn is valuable, almost as valuable as gold and cocaine in East Asia, and it's used
*26:56.300- 27:03.180* :  traditionally for medicine as well as to make jewelry. And so it's incredibly, it's in great
*27:03.180- 27:09.260* :  demand in East Asia, and that's really what caused this increase in the number of rhinos,
*27:09.260- 27:14.740* :  as well as in elephants being poached the side of the world. And it's very difficult, isn't it,
*27:14.740- 27:21.120* :  given how valuable that that horn is for the authorities in South Africa to tackle the problem
*27:21.120- 27:25.880* :  of poaching, especially because there are reports that sometimes the very people are supposed to be
*27:25.880- 27:31.140* :  protecting the rhinos, the park rangers are sometimes colluding with the poachers. It's a
*27:31.140- 27:36.720* :  multifaceted problem. I think one of the biggest ones is just the sheer size of the reserves, which
*27:36.720- 27:42.560* :  make it really difficult to patrol, and really expensive to patrol. And so in fallazzy, for example,
*27:42.560- 27:48.920* :  is about 96,000 hectares. And Kruger National Park is just a little bit smaller than Belgium.
*27:49.440- 27:53.760* :  And the poachers are operating at all hours of the day. They don't have a routine. And so it's
*27:53.760- 27:58.800* :  really difficult to monitor their movements and to monitor and try to guess where they'll be.
*27:59.220- 28:04.500* :  But as you point out there, the other problem is the enabling. The poachers and the international
*28:04.500- 28:10.140* :  criminal syndicates wouldn't be able to get as close to the rhinos without collusion from the
*28:10.140- 28:16.440* :  local communities as well as from the local game rangers themselves. And even in South Africa,
*28:16.440- 28:22.280* :  some game rangers have been arrested for poaching. But I think what South Africa and what a lot of
*28:22.280- 28:27.700* :  countries in South Africa are trying to do is to try to incentivize the game rangers by paying
*28:27.700- 28:33.520* :  them all, making sure that they have access to better weapons, more sophisticated weapons,
*28:33.580- 28:39.380* :  because a lot of the times the poachers have a lot of sophisticated weaponry. But I think
*28:39.380- 28:45.360* :  South Africa is also trying to improve its vitting of the game rangers and all its employees
*28:45.920- 28:49.700* :  to ensure that the poachers aren't included in their workforce.
*28:49.700- 28:56.180* :  Shanghai and Yaka. Cigars are probably Cuba's best known exports. So it's fitting that one of the
*28:56.180- 29:02.480* :  world's largest cigar festivals, the Festival del Habano, is taking place in Havana. But as Cuba's
*29:02.480- 29:08.040* :  economy continues to struggle, how much will this festival help it? Rahul Tandon spoke to
*29:08.040- 29:14.260* :  Usmanda Wood, managing director of the online magazine Cigar Inspector. Cuba's, of course, massively
*29:14.260- 29:19.820* :  important to the global supply of cigars, as is Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Honduras,
*29:19.820- 29:25.640* :  in Mexico, all of these countries individually have a massive role to play within the cigar industry.
*29:26.000- 29:31.460* :  And in terms of an industry, is it an industry that's growing? Absolutely. The pandemic will
*29:31.460- 29:35.440* :  provide a massive boost to the industry, because of course, everyone is at home,
*29:35.440- 29:39.760* :  they want to do anything. So they sat at home and enjoyed whatever they could. And Cigars were
*29:39.760- 29:45.660* :  one of the luxuries that a lot of people wanted to enjoy. So the industry has seen a massive boom
*29:45.660- 29:50.820* :  in the last few years. It was already growing. And then the pandemic kind of had a significant
*29:50.820- 29:55.820* :  impact on top of that. Although it's slowing down relative to the pandemic, if you look at it over
*29:55.820- 29:59.880* :  a long term period, the industry is still growing. You're there in Havana at the moment, aren't you,
*30:00.600- 30:06.720* :  and Cuba has an economy that is struggling to some extent. So I suppose the growth of the cigar
*30:06.720- 30:10.800* :  industry is something that is really helping that economy at these difficult times.
*30:10.960- 30:15.980* :  Oh, definitely. I mean, the latest figures are that Havana, or a banner, I should say,
*30:15.980- 30:21.700* :  has generated more income this year than last year. Last year, I think they generated 543 million.
*30:21.700- 30:28.680* :  This year, they've generated $722 million. So it's a significant increase from year on year. And
*30:28.680- 30:35.100* :  that is obviously having a huge impact on the economy over here. China is the biggest consumer
*30:35.100- 30:40.600* :  of those Cubans, Cigars. Of course, a big problem for Cuba. Is it cannot sell to North America,
*30:40.600- 30:47.260* :  the US, in particular, that trade embargo came in in 1962? Is there any chance of that being lifted
*30:47.260- 30:51.840* :  and how dramatically would that affect sales from Cuba? It's difficult to say. I mean,
*30:51.840- 30:57.400* :  there's no words at the moment or no information suggesting that the embargo is going to be lifted
*30:57.740- 31:03.960* :  in any reasonable measure of time. Currently, it's also difficult to say how that will impact
*31:03.960- 31:10.800* :  the Cuban cigar industry. However, based on certain thesis that were completed and certain
*31:11.020- 31:16.620* :  white papers that were produced, on this particular subject, the recommendation was that Cuba
*31:16.620- 31:23.040* :  does not sell directly or online to the US market. And instead, they open up boutique stores
*31:23.360- 31:28.280* :  in key locations in the US. This was produced by a friend of mine called Stephen Nierkin and he
*31:28.280- 31:34.020* :  recommended this to Abanos. It was Mandaroud of the online magazine Cigar Inspector.
*31:35.120- 31:41.080* :  It was known as Britain's wonkyest pub. The quirky, centuries-old watering hole was called
*31:41.080- 31:46.680* :  the Crooked House because of its leaning walls and tilting foundations. It hit the headlines
*31:46.680- 31:52.640* :  last year when it burnt down just weeks after being bought by new owners who then demolished it
*31:52.640- 31:59.180* :  without permission. Now they've been ordered to rebuild it exactly as it was brick by brick
*31:59.180- 32:06.500* :  as Alice Adley reports. The 18th century pub, the Crooked House, was first built as a farmhouse,
*32:06.500- 32:13.920* :  but it's been a pub since about 1830. Mining in the local area had caused one side to sink and it
*32:13.920- 32:19.340* :  became a popular attraction in England's Midlands with visitors flocking to see the distinctive
*32:19.340- 32:25.980* :  leaning building. After the pub court fire last August, it was demolished just two days later,
*32:25.980- 32:31.960* :  which caused a public outcry. The owners of the Crooked House have been ordered to rebuild it.
*32:32.420- 32:36.140* :  Ian Sandall is from the campaign group saved the Crooked House.
*32:36.560- 32:41.200* :  There is a long way to go and this is only the first step, but what a successful step this has
*32:41.220- 32:46.880* :  been when we all stand together for a cause and we actually stand up and be counted. You know,
*32:46.880- 32:51.720* :  we've got this first step on the on the battle one. This has taken over our lives.
*32:52.160- 32:57.700* :  The local council say the building must be returned to the way it was before the fire within
*32:57.700- 33:04.140* :  the next three years. The owners have 30 days to appeal against the ruling. Meanwhile, a police
*33:04.140- 33:09.200* :  investigation into the alleged arson continues. Alice Adley.
