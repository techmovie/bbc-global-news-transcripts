*01:49.140- 01:53.480* :  these are our main stories. The jailed Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan
*01:53.480- 01:59.000* :  has declared himself the winner of the general election via an AI-generated message.
*01:59.580- 02:02.500* :  His main rival, Noah Sharif, also said he had won.
*02:03.280- 02:11.320* :  There's growing international unease at the Israeli Prime Minister's instruction to his military to prepare to evacuate civilians from Rafa in Gaza,
*02:11.800- 02:14.160* :  where more than a million people have taken shelter.
*02:15.040- 02:23.180* :  Also, police in the Senegalese capital have fired tear gas demonstrators protesting against the decision to postpone elections there.
*02:25.460- 02:26.220* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:26.260- 02:29.800* :  the tower was located at a remote site from our studios.
*02:30.020- 02:34.520* :  Our landscaping crew that went down to kind of clean up the property and cut the grass.
*02:34.520- 02:36.240* :  They're the ones that discovered it.

*02:43.740- 02:45.740* :  belonging to a local radio station?
*02:49.080- 02:54.300* :  We begin in Pakistan where the imprisoned Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan is
*02:54.300- 02:56.980* :  claiming victory in Thursday's general election.
*02:56.980- 03:04.280* :  In an AI-generated message shared by his PTI party, Mr. Khan rejected an earlier victory declaration
*03:04.280- 03:07.960* :  by his rival, Noah Sharif, and his PMLN faction.
*03:08.760- 03:12.620* :  Here's what Imran Khan said when he called on his supporters to celebrate.
*03:16.880- 03:20.560* :  You have laid the foundation for your genuine freedom by voting.
*03:20.700- 03:25.540* :  We have won the 2024 election with a two-thirds majority.
*03:26.360- 03:28.920* :  And this is what Mr. Sharif said to his supporters.
*03:42.280- 03:45.340* :  Imran Khan and the PTI were barred from standing,
*03:45.780- 03:50.560* :  but independent candidates linked to him have emerged as the single biggest group.
*03:51.260- 03:54.280* :  But independent members cannot form a government on their own.
*03:54.280- 03:58.300* :  And Mr. Sharif, who's believed to be supported by Pakistan's military,
*03:58.680- 04:01.100* :  called on other parties to join his government.
*04:01.880- 04:05.320* :  As we record this podcast, some votes are still being counted.
*04:05.320- 04:09.440* :  Our correspondent Caroline Davis is following developments from Lahore.
*04:13.640- 04:16.140* :  Fireworks, drums, and an excited crowd,
*04:16.140- 04:18.560* :  they certainly felt like a victory rally.
*04:19.060- 04:21.980* :  But the results aren't final and this party isn't in the lead.
*04:24.780- 04:28.860* :  Noah Sharif's PMLN party has won over 60 seats at last count.
*04:29.300- 04:32.040* :  That puts them behind the number of independent candidates
*04:32.560- 04:34.660* :  backed by Imran Khan's PTI party.
*04:34.660- 04:39.780* :  But if PMLN can form alliances, they could get the numbers to form a government.
*04:39.780- 04:42.080* :  Noah Sharif addressed the crowd.
*04:42.080- 04:45.740* :  But as we don't have a majority to form a government on our own,
*04:45.740- 04:50.260* :  we're going to have to invite allies to come and join us and form a coalition government.
*04:51.060- 04:53.460* :  There's a complication for Mr. Khan's PTI.
*04:54.020- 04:58.500* :  Weeks before the election, the Electoral Commission stopped recognizing them as a political party.
*04:59.060- 05:01.040* :  It meant all the candidates ran as independence.
*05:01.900- 05:05.900* :  They have only three days to join a political party or stay as independence.
*05:06.520- 05:09.400* :  Other parties may try to persuade them to join their ranks.
*05:09.660- 05:16.620* :  In the hall, crowds protested outside the polling office's building.
*05:16.620- 05:20.240* :  PTI has claimed that many of the votes they did not win are rigged.
*05:20.520- 05:21.960* :  They're challenging some in court.
*05:22.480- 05:26.800* :  And there's the question of who will lead the party in Imran Khan is still in prison.
*05:27.560- 05:30.900* :  This election has left Pakistan in a state of uncertainty.
*05:31.600- 05:34.280* :  Months of political turmoil is not over yet.
*05:35.060- 05:36.860* :  Caroline Davis in Pakistan.
*05:38.420- 05:40.320* :  Wanted by the Israeli Prime Minister,
*05:40.320- 05:43.980* :  a plan to evacuate civilians from Rafa in southern Gaza
*05:44.380- 05:47.580* :  and to defeat remaining Hamas fighters still in the city.
*05:48.060- 05:51.420* :  That's the challenge Benjamin Netanyahu has posed to his military forces
*05:51.420- 05:57.200* :  about an area that's now crammed with as many as half of the strips 2.3 million people.
*05:57.840- 06:03.340* :  They've sought shelter as Israeli forces bombed the territory in their quest to destroy Hamas.
*06:04.000- 06:08.220* :  The White House has warned Israel its forces should not enter the overcrowded town.
*06:08.220- 06:12.380* :  But Mr. Netanyahu says Israeli soldiers will soon arrive.
*06:13.080- 06:16.480* :  The head of the Norwegian refugee council Jan Egland told the BBC
*06:16.480- 06:20.060* :  that such an operation in Rafa would be a catastrophe.
*06:20.860- 06:24.000* :  Well, it would be a war in a refugee camp.
*06:24.280- 06:30.660* :  There is no other way to describe Rafa than the world's biggest displacement camps.
*06:30.660- 06:34.940* :  There are people on the flimsy plastic sheeting.
*06:34.940- 06:37.720* :  They are fighting for food.
*06:38.200- 06:39.860* :  There is no drinking water.
*06:40.720- 06:42.540* :  There is epidemic disease.
*06:43.380- 06:46.640* :  And then they want to have bring a war to this place.
*06:47.120- 06:48.580* :  You can't make it up really.
*06:49.240- 06:53.880* :  The United Nations also warned that sending in Israeli ground forces into Rafa
*06:54.260- 06:55.480* :  could lead to war crimes.
*06:55.980- 06:57.720* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*06:57.980- 06:59.720* :  sent us this report from Jerusalem.
*07:00.780- 07:02.140* :  We'll send it to us.
*07:04.340- 07:07.440* :  Something like 1.2 million people are crowded into Rafa,
*07:07.920- 07:12.200* :  hard against the Egyptian border at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip.
*07:12.980- 07:17.200* :  Since Israel and Egypt do not allow international journalist intergarza,
*07:17.740- 07:22.540* :  we rely on brave Palestinian colleagues who are there and can't get out.
*07:23.380- 07:29.940* :  Their latest pictures show more dead civilians and thousands of makeshift tents made of plastic sheets
*07:30.480- 07:34.520* :  and women cooking and children playing near pools of sewage.
*07:36.380- 07:39.900* :  Umhussam al-Ata said her family has been moving,
*07:39.900- 07:43.280* :  frequently displaced by Israel since the war started.
*07:43.840- 07:48.300* :  Wherever we go she said, we're surrounded by rubbish and sewage.
*07:52.000- 07:57.260* :  Deadly airstrikes hit Rafa in the last 24 hours, but the big fear is Israel's threat to
*07:57.260- 08:00.720* :  amount of full-scale military offensive into the town.
*08:02.160- 08:07.080* :  Jabba al-Burdini spoke not long after Israel hit the house of his neighbors,
*08:07.660- 08:09.860* :  the al-Said family killing more children.
*08:12.660- 08:13.700* :  This is the last point.
*08:14.080- 08:18.340* :  If there were Israeli operations here, it means that there will be thousands of people being killed.
*08:19.180- 08:23.120* :  The fear of children is increasing, the adults are now in terror.
*08:23.940- 08:25.720* :  Look at the children, they can't sleep.
*08:27.180- 08:33.500* :  In Jerusalem, I went to the former British military camp that houses the HQ of Unruh,
*08:33.800- 08:38.280* :  the embattled UN agency that looks after Palestinian refugees.
*08:39.160- 08:40.840* :  Its actor doesn't employees.
*08:40.840- 08:44.800* :  Israel said had taken part in the 7th of October attacks.
*08:44.800- 08:50.360* :  Unruh Commissioner General Philippe Lazareini has appointed an independent inquiry which
*08:50.740- 08:55.880* :  he hopes will further reassure Israel and the donors including Britain and the US
*08:56.400- 08:57.980* :  who have suspended funding.
*08:58.420- 09:03.520* :  On the humanitarian front, Mr. Lazareini said Israel's threat to attack Rafa
*09:04.040- 09:08.200* :  would deepen the disaster inflicted on innocent civilians.
*09:08.580- 09:16.040* :  Such a military operation would add an additional apocalyptic layer into Gaza Strip.
*09:16.120- 09:16.960* :  Apocalyptic?
*09:16.960- 09:18.140* :  That's a very strong word.
*09:18.140- 09:24.860* :  It is a strong warrant, but if you talk about a military operation in this place,
*09:24.860- 09:35.520* :  you can only add an additional disastrous layer of tragedy and this needs absolutely to be avoided.
*09:36.100- 09:41.380* :  Those comments will only worsen the suspicions of many Israelis who are overwhelmingly behind
*09:41.380- 09:47.720* :  the war on Hamas, people like Uzidayan, a former general and deputy head of the armed forces.
*09:48.040- 09:53.940* :  So we are almost there and we will find a way with our civil administration
*09:54.300- 09:57.960* :  to give the people, medicine, food, etc.
*09:57.960- 10:07.280* :  But we don't want the other possibility is to give it back to the Hamas and Unruh
*10:07.700- 10:13.020* :  and to face again another 7th of October, we will never agree to it.
*10:17.580- 10:23.340* :  General Diane went off to address right-wing groups determined not to let the Israeli government
*10:23.340- 10:27.400* :  make any concessions to its critics, including the U.S.
*10:27.440- 10:31.260* :  They demonstrated noisily in the center of Jerusalem.
*10:37.460- 10:39.760* :  Dr. David Matal was there with his wife.
*10:39.800- 10:43.140* :  They have three sons fighting for Israel in Gaza.
*10:44.040- 10:50.360* :  They're saying that they're ready and willing to sacrifice their lives to protect the Jewish people
*10:51.420- 10:57.640* :  and they will not accept demobilization and they will not accept withholding fire
*10:58.140- 11:03.660* :  and they will not accept anything less than the complete extermination of the Hamas.
*11:10.140- 11:15.800* :  Thousands of young men are spinning around, arm in arm, hand in hand, in circles.
*11:15.800- 11:20.780* :  It's a great big dance, it's a traditional thing that they do and it's to celebrate
*11:21.380- 11:26.780* :  and they're singing along with the music in a mass display here, not just of support for the war
*11:26.780- 11:32.180* :  support for the soldiers and not just patriotism but also certain kind of patriotism.
*11:32.460- 11:38.540* :  A view of how Israel should be in full, the people here who are overwhelmingly, I'd say,
*11:38.540- 11:46.520* :  from the settler movement it is a view of this land that says this is a land for the Jews.
*11:47.300- 11:49.940* :  It's certainly not a place for a Palestinian state.
*11:50.280- 11:55.520* :  A few years ago I might have said seeing these people this is one component of Israel
*11:56.160- 12:01.400* :  but now increasingly given the current government is looking more like the mainstream.
*12:02.060- 12:06.180* :  Jamie Bowen in Jerusalem.
*12:07.500- 12:12.180* :  I mean, while the US is planning to make more than 100 countries it supplies with weapons or
*12:12.180- 12:16.680* :  military aid declared that they will not use them to breach international law.
*12:16.680- 12:20.620* :  The announcement follows pressure from some Democrats who have called for more
*12:20.620- 12:24.140* :  stringent guarantees over arms transfers to Israel.
*12:24.680- 12:27.280* :  Here's our State Department correspondent Tom Peckman.
*12:27.620- 12:31.300* :  Countries that get weapons from the US and are currently involved in active conflict
*12:31.300- 12:36.600* :  have 45 days to sign a waiver promising to maintain international law
*12:37.000- 12:39.660* :  and not to block US humanitarian aid supplies.
*12:40.540- 12:44.220* :  If the administration finds breaches the arms transfers could be stopped.
*12:44.900- 12:48.840* :  The new guarantees are being described as historic by some democratic senators
*12:49.280- 12:54.220* :  who had pushed for tougher checks on weapon supplies to Israel amid the spiraling civilian
*12:54.220- 12:56.800* :  death toll in its war with Hamas in Gaza.
*12:57.440- 13:00.380* :  Although the announcement doesn't specifically name any countries,
*13:01.040- 13:03.980* :  more than 100 receive American arms or military aid.
*13:04.180- 13:08.580* :  Israel is historically the biggest recipient with military aid currently standing at around
*13:08.580- 13:10.780* :  $3.8 billion a year.
*13:11.400- 13:16.320* :  The administration has repeated its line for weeks that too many Palestinian civilians are being
*13:16.320- 13:21.680* :  killed in Gaza and there is growing frustration from officials that the message is not being
*13:21.680- 13:26.720* :  heated. On Thursday, President Biden said Israel had gone over the top in its military
*13:26.720- 13:31.620* :  response in Gaza. Pressure from the left wing of the Democratic Party to use armed
*13:31.620- 13:36.260* :  suppliers' leverage over Israel's military practices had so far been ignored.
*13:36.800- 13:39.700* :  This appears to be a move towards addressing their concerns.
*13:40.400- 13:46.300* :  Tom Peckman. In Senegal, police fired tear gas and stun grenades on Friday to prevent
*13:46.300- 13:50.720* :  protesters from gathering in the capital Daca. They were denouncing the postponement
*13:50.720- 13:53.460* :  of the country's elections, as Miami Jones reports.
*13:54.080- 13:58.700* :  There were scenes of chaos in the seaside capital of Daca today, a newly formed coalition of
*13:58.700- 14:03.060* :  opposition parties called for mass protests to be held on Friday against the postponement
*14:03.060- 14:07.500* :  of the presidential elections. They accused President Makisal of trying to cling to power,
*14:07.500- 14:12.480* :  something he denies. Senegal's reputation as one of West Africa's most stable democracies
*14:12.480- 14:16.520* :  has taken a blow this week, following the decision by Parliament to delay the elections
*14:16.520- 14:20.960* :  until the end of the year. President Makisal says it was necessary because of disputes
*14:20.960- 14:25.360* :  over the legibility of opposition candidates that risked destabilizing the country,
*14:25.360- 14:30.440* :  regional organizations, as well as Senegal's Western allies have expressed concern at the decision.
*14:31.040- 14:36.760* :  Miami Jones. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war there that's lasted for nearly
*14:36.760- 14:42.920* :  two years, thousands of children have been taken out of the country. He says around 20,000 have been
*14:42.920- 14:49.100* :  taken to Russia without their family's consent. Moscow insists what it calls evacuated children
*14:49.100- 14:54.580* :  have left Ukraine only at their own request, but President Putin is the subject of an international
*14:54.580- 15:00.040* :  arrest warrant. He's been accused of overseeing a policy of forced child deportation.
*15:00.760- 15:04.240* :  Now a group of researchers based at European headquarters of the Netherlands
*15:04.240- 15:09.980* :  have tracked down eight of the children using digital technology. I heard more from our correspondent
*15:09.980- 15:16.880* :  Anna Holligan using the Hague. From the headquarters in Europe it was a team of 60 detectives and
*15:16.880- 15:22.100* :  researchers from 23 countries that gathered together for what they called a hackathon and it
*15:22.100- 15:27.240* :  sounds as though it was meant to be a kind of training exercise and they've used a series of
*15:27.240- 15:33.060* :  open source techniques and they started off by looking at images of some of the missing children
*15:33.060- 15:37.640* :  and then they looked for images within those photographs to help them work at the location.
*15:38.120- 15:43.580* :  So for example I'm looking at the window now if there was a child you might spot a car registration
*15:43.580- 15:50.000* :  plate building something like that and then they use satellite tracking to try and pinpoint the
*15:50.000- 15:56.060* :  exact location and then they analyze network data to try to work out if there were other children
*15:56.060- 16:01.920* :  within that same location. So they know where these eight children are? They know where these children
*16:01.920- 16:07.760* :  are and the complicated thing now is is actually guessing them out because obviously our first question
*16:07.760- 16:10.980* :  when we came across this story was okay you know where they are. So now what?
*16:11.300- 16:17.100* :  Europe will say they've passed the information over to the Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine was part
*16:17.100- 16:22.120* :  of this investigation, this digital investigation. They've passed the information over it's now up
*16:22.120- 16:28.540* :  to Ukraine to open an investigation and then potentially look at trying to retrieve some of
*16:28.540- 16:32.880* :  these children. Do we know if they're all together? We don't know if they're all together and we don't
*16:33.520- 16:38.700* :  know where they are now so they located their whereabouts but obviously they are potentially
*16:38.700- 16:43.580* :  moving around because Russia changed the rules so it would make it easier for Russian families to
*16:43.580- 16:48.580* :  adopt Ukrainian children. It would make it easier for Russian families to change Ukrainian
*16:48.580- 16:54.240* :  children's names. They made it easier for Ukrainian children to get Russian passport.
*16:54.540- 17:00.780* :  Eight children have been tracked. Are they going to try and track more of the around 20,000 that have
*17:00.780- 17:05.700* :  gone missing or they don't know where they are? Yes, they are. They say they will continue with this
*17:05.840- 17:11.720* :  because there aren't really many other options at the moment but there are. We should mention
*17:11.720- 17:17.580* :  some success stories because it's not just Europe and the international team of detectors that have
*17:17.580- 17:23.660* :  been working on this. Ukrainian charities have been and you may have seen last year our colleague Sarah
*17:23.660- 17:29.480* :  Reinsford follows some Ukrainian mothers who had gone to try and track down their own missing children.
*17:30.000- 17:35.040* :  Anna Holligan and Sarah Reinsford's documentary is called Ukraine the Missing Children.
*17:37.440- 17:42.160* :  Still to come. The French data protection agency says that the information that's been taken
*17:42.160- 17:47.940* :  is names, dates of birth and social security numbers and the number of people affected could be
*17:47.940- 17:54.060* :  as high as 33 million. The French public are asked to be alert online following a cyber attack
*17:54.060- 18:03.800* :  into two medical insurance service providers. We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well,
*18:03.800- 18:10.600* :  Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world
*18:11.380- 18:17.880* :  but something happened not just to him but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to
*18:17.880- 18:26.480* :  leave forced out. I'm Una Chaplin and from CBC podcasts and the BBC World Service this is Hollywood

*19:09.420- 19:14.380* :  Welcome back. For years Haiti has been plagued by unrelenting gang violence.
*19:14.380- 19:19.620* :  criminals control most of the capital, Porter Prince. Now the United Nations says this
*19:19.620- 19:25.860* :  January was Haiti's most violent month in two years. A UN spokeswoman Maria Hartado explained
*19:25.860- 19:31.140* :  that more than a thousand people were killed in the first 31 days of 2024.
*19:31.740- 19:36.420* :  The already dire human rights situation has deteriorated even farther with disastrous
*19:36.420- 19:43.940* :  consequence for Asians. At least 806 people not involved in violent exchanges taking place
*19:43.940- 19:49.740* :  or killed injured or kidnapped in January. In addition, some 300 gang members were killed or
*19:49.740- 19:57.200* :  injured, bringing the total number of people affected to 1,108. More than three times the number
*19:57.200- 20:03.000* :  recorded in January 2023. Against this backdrop of violence, protests have taken place,
*20:03.000- 20:08.540* :  demanding the current unelected Prime Minister Arielle Henri's stepstone. He was appointed
*20:08.540- 20:14.020* :  as 24 hours before President Maurice was assassinated in July 2021.
*20:14.920- 20:20.260* :  According Miami on Friday sentenced a Haitian American man to life in prison for his
*20:20.260- 20:25.580* :  wool in the murder. Joseph Vincent, a former informant for the US Drug Enforcement Agency,
*20:25.580- 20:31.240* :  had pleaded guilty two months ago. He's the fourth person so far to be given a life sentence
*20:31.240- 20:37.000* :  for the crime. Mr Henri has been really Haiti since President Maurice's death, despite promising
*20:37.000- 20:42.120* :  to pave the way for long-delayed elections to be held. I spoke to Woodlow-Marrancourt,
*20:42.120- 20:47.760* :  a journalist in Porto Prince, about the situation there. We have deepening of the
*20:47.760- 20:53.500* :  Institute of Security climate that started at least since the President of the Maurice was killed
*20:53.500- 20:59.760* :  in the intimacy of his bedroom in 2021, and that situation spiraled out of control
*21:00.460- 21:05.880* :  under the government of Arielle Henri, who is the Prime Minister that he selected. The second
*21:05.880- 21:13.840* :  thing is you also have a political crisis where this Prime Minister promised to bring security
*21:13.840- 21:21.780* :  to the country, to organize elections, and to relinquish power or give power to another government,
*21:22.580- 21:28.520* :  an elected government. But this hasn't happened. The insecurity climate has worsened
*21:28.620- 21:34.980* :  under his term, and today we don't have a date for the next elections and people are
*21:34.980- 21:43.640* :  increasingly showing discontent towards this government. We've just heard that a U.S. Court
*21:43.640- 21:49.620* :  has sentenced a Haitian-American man to life in prison for his role in the murder of the former
*21:49.620- 21:55.600* :  President Yovni Moïse. How important do you think the assassination of him was in the way
*21:55.600- 22:01.520* :  the country spiraled, as you put it? I think the assassination of the President is a symptom
*22:01.520- 22:08.980* :  of a deeper problem. The deep problem is no citizen today in Haiti is safe, and that was the case
*22:08.980- 22:15.640* :  when Yovni Moïse and an outside figure became President. That was the case when the man who
*22:15.640- 22:21.220* :  selected him to become President Michel Joseph Marteli Singer was leading the country, and this
*22:21.220- 22:27.880* :  problem deepened during his term, and it culminated with his assassination. And since that time,
*22:28.380- 22:36.260* :  the insecurity problem gets even more daring and more difficult. We are talking about collective
*22:36.300- 22:43.220* :  rapes of women. We are talking about several neighborhoods under the entire control of gangs,
*22:43.220- 22:51.080* :  where every aspect of life is being from how you get food, are regulated tightly. By the
*22:51.080- 22:57.160* :  gangs, we are talking about hundreds and hundreds of businesses being closed and thousands of
*22:57.160- 23:02.800* :  professionals living this country, because they don't feel safe, because gangs are kidnapping people
*23:03.340- 23:09.640* :  and asking anything as low as a hundred U.S. dollars to hundreds of thousands and sometimes we
*23:09.640- 23:15.520* :  hear numbers like millions of dollars. Woodlor Merencourt, Import Prince. Chili's left-wing
*23:15.520- 23:21.100* :  President Gabriel Borich has paid tribute to his predecessor Sebastian Piñera at a state funeral
*23:21.100- 23:27.540* :  in the capital Santiago. Mr. Piñero died in a helicopter crash on Tuesday. Our America's regional
*23:27.540- 23:33.720* :  editor Leonardo Rosha reports. The death of Mr. Piñera has resulted in some degree of reconciliation
*23:33.720- 23:39.420* :  between the left and the right in Chili, a country polarized by the legacy of General Pinochet's
*23:39.420- 23:44.620* :  military rule. Speaking at the funeral in Santiago's Cathedral, Mr. Borich acknowledged that the
*23:44.620- 23:50.560* :  criticism on Mr. Piñera's administration during mass street protests in 2019 had gone beyond what
*23:50.560- 23:57.220* :  was fair and reasonable. An emotional tribute was paid by some of the 33 miners rescued in 2010
*23:57.220- 24:02.960* :  after more than two months trapped underground. They said they're all their lives to Mr. Piñera.
*24:03.540- 24:09.400* :  Leonardo Rosha, here in Britain, the king's second son Prince Harry, is to receive what's being
*24:09.400- 24:15.360* :  described as a substantial payout for the remaining claims in his phone hacking case against the media
*24:15.360- 24:20.500* :  giant Mirror Group newspapers. The Prince was not in London for Friday's hearing, but his lawyer's
*24:20.500- 24:26.140* :  read out a statement outside the court. After our victory in December, Mirror Group have finally
*24:26.140- 24:32.900* :  conceded the rest of my claim. Everything we said was happening at Mirror Group was in fact
*24:32.900- 24:39.320* :  happening and indeed far worse as the court ruled in its extremely damaging judgment.
*24:39.860- 24:46.320* :  As the judge has said only this morning, we have uncovered and proved the shockingly dishonest
*24:46.400- 24:52.540* :  way in which the Mirror acted for so many years and then sought to conceal the truth.
*24:53.340- 25:00.080* :  In December, Prince Harry was awarded more than $170,000 in damages after the UK's high court
*25:00.080- 25:06.540* :  ruled that 15 newspaper articles featured by the group were the product of unlawful news gathering.
*25:07.220- 25:11.220* :  On Friday, Mirror Group released a statement saying it was pleased to have reached a deal
*25:11.220- 25:17.060* :  over events for which it had apologized. But what exactly did Mirror Group do to get to this point?
*25:17.060- 25:22.020* :  I asked our Home Affairs correspondent Tom Simons. Well, it publishes tabloid newspapers
*25:22.020- 25:28.160* :  and it came up with stories in part by hacking people's phones to getting their voicemail messages.
*25:28.660- 25:34.360* :  Now, Prince Harry has known for about 10 years that he was victim of this but he hasn't sued.
*25:34.360- 25:39.680* :  The royal family didn't sue. That was the mantra really. But then he decided to try to take on
*25:39.680- 25:45.200* :  the media and this legal battle in court, not just this newspaper group but others too,
*25:45.200- 25:50.940* :  has really dominated his profile in the UK. And what he has proven through a court case last year,
*25:50.940- 25:56.480* :  in which there was a judgment, was that executives at Mirror Group knew that journalists and private
*25:57.200- 26:01.420* :  investigators were accessing people's phones, doing blacking, which is trying to get personal
*26:01.420- 26:07.920* :  information through Syrup Tish's means. Today was the second stage of that. The company decided to
*26:07.920- 26:13.020* :  settle out of court, ending this whole process for Mirror Group newspapers. And it would be paying
*26:13.020- 26:20.140* :  Prince Harry a sum of probably approaching $400,000. But that's today. I mean, how much could this
*26:20.140- 26:26.380* :  cost Mirror Group in all? Well, in a way, the damages are only part of it because even today,
*26:26.380- 26:33.840* :  even only part of this case has cost, we know, $2 million and more. There are probably a hundred
*26:33.840- 26:39.080* :  more well-known people and their friends who are often targeted to who are going to sue Mirror Group
*26:39.380- 26:44.500* :  and try to get their cases settled as well. So it's the end of it for Prince Harry and Mirror Group
*26:44.500- 26:49.300* :  newspapers, but he's pursuing other newspapers as well, isn't he? There are two other newspaper
*26:49.300- 26:54.040* :  groups. There's a group called Associating Newspapers, which publishes another newspaper
*26:54.040- 26:59.340* :  called The Daily Mail, which is a popular newspaper in the UK, and also news group newspapers,
*26:59.340- 27:04.560* :  now called News UK, which publishes The Sun, which is one of the classic red top tabloid newspapers.
*27:05.060- 27:09.380* :  And there's another demand that's come from Prince Harry, which I think is important. He wants the
*27:09.380- 27:16.880* :  police to reopen investigations into all of this. There were convictions in 2014 of journalists.
*27:17.460- 27:22.100* :  So he wants that to be reopened, but so far Scotland Yards, which is where the Metropolitan
*27:22.100- 27:27.720* :  Police in London is based, have not really been commenting. Tom Simons, and in France,
*27:27.720- 27:34.060* :  too, privacy has become a huge issue this week. After the personal data of more than 33 million
*27:34.060- 27:40.180* :  French citizens was compromised, following a cyber attack into two medical insurance service providers.
*27:40.880- 27:44.840* :  Hugh Skurfield reports from Paris. The two companies at the heart of this provide
*27:44.840- 27:49.740* :  information to health service professionals such as pharmacists so that they can be sure their
*27:49.740- 27:54.580* :  clients are covered by top-up health insurance and can therefore be supplied free of charge.
*27:54.620- 27:59.860* :  The French Data Protection Agency says that the information that's been taken is names,
*27:59.860- 28:05.240* :  dates of birth, and social security numbers, and the number of people affected could be as high as
*28:05.240- 28:10.500* :  33 million, though that's an upper limit and has not been confirmed. As things stand,
*28:10.500- 28:14.900* :  the Data Protection Agency says the information is of limited use to criminals.
*28:14.900- 28:20.420* :  It does not include emails, telephones, or bank details, but it is warning the public to be
*28:20.420- 28:25.920* :  very aware in the coming weeks of so-called phishing attempts in which criminals could use the
*28:25.920- 28:31.540* :  data they have, the social security number, for example, as a lever to price out more sensitive
*28:32.260- 28:36.840* :  information. The agency is also checking into the two companies to see that they had the correct
*28:36.840- 28:42.500* :  protections in place before their data banks were invaded. Hugh Skurfield in Paris.
*28:43.180- 28:49.340* :  And finally, to the United States, where a radio station in Alabama has stopped transmitting,
*28:49.340- 28:55.440* :  after thieves stole its 16-metre-tall radio tower and other equipment from a building.
*28:55.440- 29:02.340* :  The radio station that owns the tower is WJLX. James Reynolds spoke to the station's General Manager,
*29:02.340- 29:07.460* :  Brett Elmore, and asked him, how can you steal a 16-metre radio tower?
*29:07.900- 29:12.700* :  That's a great question. It's been a mystery to all of us here. It happened one week ago,
*29:12.700- 29:18.120* :  that we discovered that the tower was gone. I have no work with the idea, but somehow they made
*29:18.120- 29:23.080* :  off with that and all of the equipment in our transmitter building. Did that mean, Brett,
*29:23.080- 29:26.340* :  that as you and your colleagues arrive for work one morning, you looked up and saw,
*29:26.540- 29:31.380* :  hey, where's the tower? The tower was located at a remote site from our studios,
*29:31.380- 29:39.520* :  so it's in about a 50-acre wooded area, so our landscaping crew that went down to kind of
*29:39.520- 29:43.880* :  clean up the property and cut the grass and everything for the spring, they're the ones that
*29:43.880- 29:48.020* :  discovered it. I mean, they must have been pretty surprised. Oh, yeah, they called me immediately
*29:48.020- 29:53.160* :  until the tower was gone. I was like, what do you mean the tower's gone? Where is it? Who did it?
*29:53.400- 29:59.880* :  Yeah, that's the million-dollar question, and the police are working on it, and we hope we find
*29:59.880- 30:05.620* :  the criminals. It is a federal crime to tamper with a licensed facility like that, so the property
*30:05.620- 30:11.120* :  was uninsured. We're a small market station. It's going to cost a lot of money for us to rebuild,
*30:11.260- 30:16.640* :  so that's why we kind of started a GoFundMe account. It hopes that people will help us rebuild
*30:16.640- 30:21.180* :  back bigger and better than ever. What would thieves do with a second-hand radio tower?
*30:21.400- 30:27.760* :  Well, that's the thing. Probably, if I had to guess, I know the wires, the guy wires were cut,
*30:27.760- 30:34.980* :  so they downed the tower that way, and I guess they just disassembled it in 10 or 20-foot pieces
*30:35.440- 30:41.480* :  and hauled it off and probably took it to a recycling place for a few quick dollars.
*30:41.600- 30:45.760* :  And how is your station able to transmit and broadcast it at the moment?
*30:46.040- 30:53.280* :  Unfortunately, without the AM, we are unable to even broadcast on our FM signals, so we're totally
*30:53.280- 31:00.960* :  off the air right now. We are streaming our programming online on our website, WJLX1015.com,
*31:01.460- 31:06.220* :  but we're totally off of terrestrial radio right now until we can get rebuilt.
*31:07.120- 31:11.960* :  Brett Elmore, so keep your eyes peeled for that radio tower if you're in Alabama.
*31:14.260- 31:17.720* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:18.180- 31:21.860* :  First, here's Jackie with News of this week's Happy Pot.
*31:22.140- 31:27.560* :  In this edition from disbelief to celebration, the French model maker who spent eight years of his
*31:27.560- 31:33.640* :  life on a huge, matchstick, Eiffel Tower, only to be fleetingly denied his world record.
*31:33.640- 31:39.080* :  It's an emotional roller coaster. We celebrate music from bagpipes to Afrobeats to Tracy
*31:39.080- 31:44.880* :  Chaplin to Bertson. We have your guide to the Lunar New Year celebrations, and can you tell
*31:44.880- 31:50.140* :  the sound of a happy chicken? All in the happy part available from Sunday, the 11th of February.
*31:50.400- 31:54.780* :  Thanks, Jackie, and if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,

*32:07.860- 32:14.900* :  about our report on the 8th of February regarding global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees across an
*32:14.900- 32:20.920* :  entire year. On that episode, our climate editor mentioned that renewable power made up 2%
*32:20.920- 32:25.900* :  of global energy use, and he was referring to wind and solar power specifically.
*32:26.620- 32:30.900* :  Well, this edition was mixed by Nick Randall. The producer was Liam McCheffrey. The editor is
*32:30.900- 32:34.920* :  ever is Karen Martin. I'm Valerie Sanderson, and till next time, bye-bye.
