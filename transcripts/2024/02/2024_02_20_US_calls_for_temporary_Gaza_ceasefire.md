*01:08.560- 01:11.720* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:14.880- 01:20.420* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 2pm on Tuesday, the 20th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:20.420- 01:24.440* :  The US calls for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza at the UN.
*01:24.460- 01:32.940* :  Countries, including South Africa and the Netherlands, address the UN's highest court about Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.
*01:33.520- 01:38.580* :  The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes another attempt to fight extradition to the US.
*01:42.060- 01:47.000* :  Also in this podcast, we find out what's happened to Russia's Vogue the Group.
*01:47.000- 01:52.640* :  It is the use of hard power to try and suppress opposition to the government.
*01:53.380- 01:56.880* :  In countries that are relatively fragile and ethnically diverse.
*02:01.480- 02:06.200* :  The United States has proposed a draft resolution at the UN Security Council,
*02:06.200- 02:10.060* :  calling for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as feasible.
*02:10.180- 02:16.460* :  The text reflects the language used by President Biden in talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*02:16.880- 02:18.380* :  as Netta Talfiq explains.
*02:18.940- 02:20.860* :  It is certainly a toughening of language.
*02:20.860- 02:25.260* :  This phrase, a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable.
*02:25.720- 02:30.580* :  I mean, that really echoes the language that President Joe Biden has used in his conversations
*02:30.720- 02:33.980* :  with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week.
*02:33.980- 02:38.720* :  We heard President Biden saying that he really does want to see a temporary ceasefire.
*02:38.720- 02:44.360* :  It's what the United States is working towards in negotiations with Qatar, Egypt, Israel.
*02:44.980- 02:47.740* :  So certainly, it's along the US's position.
*02:47.740- 02:51.820* :  But if you look at the rest of this proposed resolution,
*02:51.820- 02:59.620* :  the United States is certainly trying to register its opposition to Israel's plans to go into Rafa.
*03:00.160- 03:05.820* :  For example, the text condemns calls by some Israeli government ministers for Jewish settlers
*03:05.820- 03:10.920* :  to move to Gaza or any attempt at demographic or territorial change there.
*03:11.460- 03:16.960* :  And it really sounds the alarm in terms of saying that this would be a real threat to peace and
*03:16.960- 03:21.940* :  security. The United States is not abandoning in any way its ally Israel,
*03:22.520- 03:25.320* :  but it is using the forum, the UN Security Council,
*03:25.320- 03:29.040* :  to, as I say, register its opposition to Israel's plans.
*03:29.580- 03:32.160* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem is Jenny Hill.
*03:32.380- 03:36.660* :  I asked her if there would be a sense in Israel of being abandoned by the US.
*03:37.340- 03:42.200* :  I think at a government level, this won't come as a great deal of a surprise
*03:42.200- 03:47.920* :  because we've heard Joe Biden's administration toughening its language towards its ally
*03:47.920- 03:51.820* :  in recent days and weeks. Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part,
*03:51.820- 03:55.020* :  has remained completely defined in the face of growing,
*03:55.020- 03:58.080* :  well, international pressure, not just from the US,
*03:58.080- 04:01.660* :  about the human cost of his military operation in Gaza,
*04:02.000- 04:05.020* :  launched, of course, in response to the October 7th attacks.
*04:05.020- 04:12.060* :  So from his perspective, I expect we'll see more insistence on continuing with his plan.
*04:12.120- 04:15.000* :  And he, of course, justifies the grand invasion,
*04:15.000- 04:19.320* :  the planned grand invasion of Ruffa on the basis that he says there are still
*04:19.320- 04:22.760* :  battalions of Hamas fighters holed up in the city.
*04:22.760- 04:26.440* :  He also says Israel wants its hostages back and he has repeatedly said
*04:26.980- 04:31.080* :  that the only way really to get them back is to continue with military pressure.
*04:31.760- 04:36.260* :  So I'm not sure that there will be any sense of abandonment at that point.
*04:36.260- 04:41.100* :  I'm certainly no surprise. From the public perspective, I think there is growing concern here
*04:41.100- 04:44.240* :  about the government's handling of all of this.
*04:44.980- 04:48.520* :  Just yesterday in Jerusalem, there was a group of women protesting
*04:48.520- 04:51.300* :  outside the Prime Minister's official residence.
*04:51.300- 04:54.160* :  They're concerned about getting those hostages back.
*04:54.160- 04:57.980* :  The families of hostages are really worried about the strategies being employed at the moment.
*04:57.980- 05:01.360* :  And I think some of them were very much more favour,
*05:01.880- 05:05.580* :  a more diplomatic approach, a more negotiations-based approach.
*05:05.580- 05:10.600* :  They're, of course, desperately worried about the physical safety of those hostages.
*05:10.660- 05:16.520* :  Who are being held in Gaza, where air strikes and all sorts of ground operations are being
*05:16.520- 05:20.800* :  carried out. So perhaps there's going to be more consternation on the ground in Israel
*05:21.340- 05:22.360* :  than at government level.
*05:23.240- 05:27.920* :  I believe that there has been some footage of the October 7th attack that
*05:28.240- 05:29.440* :  been put out overnight.
*05:30.600- 05:35.660* :  Interestingly, I mean, the day after Israel said it would give Hamas three weeks to release
*05:35.720- 05:39.940* :  all of its hostages or that ground offensive will begin in Ruffa.
*05:40.400- 05:45.520* :  We now have some footage from the Israeli defence forces who say they recently discovered
*05:45.520- 05:48.520* :  footage from a security camera inside Gaza.
*05:48.860- 05:54.080* :  It purports to show, and you can see this online, it shows apparently the bebass family,
*05:54.080- 05:59.460* :  a mother and two of her children, one of whom's only a baby, apparently being kidnapped
*05:59.460- 06:03.460* :  on October 7th, driven away, pushed into a car and driven away.
*06:03.520- 06:05.420* :  Now, the family's fate is unclear.
*06:05.960- 06:08.940* :  Hamas said that the entire family was killed in an Israeli air strike,
*06:08.940- 06:12.400* :  but Israel said it's still looking into what's actually happened to them.
*06:12.400- 06:14.640* :  So we don't know what's happened to them.
*06:14.640- 06:18.020* :  We don't really know for certain whether they are still alive or not.
*06:18.040- 06:25.040* :  But it of course has reminded, as if Israelis needed reminding, the plight of those hostages.
*06:25.040- 06:30.540* :  And I suppose it backs up what the Israeli Prime Minister is saying,
*06:30.540- 06:34.860* :  you know, Israel wants its hostages back and it's going to continue to fight until it gets them.
*06:35.580- 06:36.780* :  Jenny Hill in Jerusalem.
*06:37.260- 06:42.020* :  The UN's International Court of Justice in the Hague is holding a public hearing on whether
*06:42.020- 06:47.580* :  Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories since the 6th day war in 1967 is legal.
*06:48.180- 06:53.100* :  The court session started on Monday today was the turn of the legal team from South Africa to put
*06:53.100- 06:57.760* :  their case. The United Nations, especially the Security Council and General Assembly,
*06:57.760- 07:02.800* :  must use all measures within their powers to bring an immediate end to the unlawful Israeli
*07:03.460- 07:06.700* :  occupation of the Palestinian territory, including Isterism.
*07:07.360- 07:12.840* :  The United Nations will also continuously monitor implementation of any order that the court
*07:12.840- 07:18.460* :  may give to end the racial discrimination and apartheid by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory.
*07:19.180- 07:21.420* :  A correspondent in the Hague is Anna Holligan.
*07:21.840- 07:26.880* :  I put it to her that South Africa using the word apartheid in relation to Israel was very
*07:26.880- 07:31.920* :  strong language. And of course it resonates. You heard there from South Africa's lawyer,
*07:31.920- 07:36.680* :  we also heard from South Africa's ambassador to the Netherlands, even stronger language.
*07:36.680- 07:42.380* :  He accused Israel of applying a more extreme version of apartheid in the Palestinian
*07:42.380- 07:46.340* :  territories than experienced in South Africa before 1994.
*07:46.380- 07:54.180* :  Busi Mousi, Monticella, told the court, we as South African sense see here and feel to our
*07:54.180- 08:00.380* :  core the inhumane discriminatory policies and practices of the Israeli regime as an even more
*08:00.380- 08:04.440* :  extreme form of the apartheid that was institutionalized against black people in my country.
*08:04.940- 08:10.540* :  So he called on all settlements to be dismantled and the two state solution implemented.
*08:10.540- 08:15.020* :  And of course those allegations have been rejected by Israel, which has argued the occupation
*08:15.020- 08:17.840* :  is a temporary and necessary security measure.
*08:18.520- 08:21.240* :  But we won't hear from Israel in the court, is that right?
*08:22.380- 08:27.520* :  That's right. So Israel doesn't recognise the ICJ's jurisdiction over its occupation of the
*08:27.520- 08:35.380* :  West Bank, but actually a submitted a five page document in which it said this whole case
*08:35.380- 08:42.760* :  could be detrimental to solving the conflict because the questions posed by the UN General Assembly.
*08:42.760- 08:47.960* :  So that's how we arrived here at this case. It was a case brought by the UN General Assembly in
*08:47.960- 08:53.300* :  December of 2022 were prejudice. And I just want to tell you very briefly Rachel, I've stepped
*08:53.300- 08:58.720* :  outside the court and I can see for the first time since these hearings began two groups of
*08:58.720- 09:06.500* :  protesters standing not very far apart, one waving Palestinian flags, the other Israeli flags.
*09:06.980- 09:10.660* :  And you might be able to hear the rumble of cars in the background too, we're just approaching
*09:10.660- 09:16.280* :  the lunch break here. Record number of countries are taking part in this 51 in total.
*09:16.680- 09:21.740* :  So we heard from South Africa, we also heard from Saudi Arabia just looking back at my notes here.
*09:22.160- 09:30.480* :  Saudi Arabia also called for an end to what he described as the brutality. He said it could not
*09:30.480- 09:37.160* :  be used as an excuse for defeating Hamas. He also said the acquisition of territory by the use of
*09:37.160- 09:42.980* :  force was a violation of international law. So we will be hearing from 51 countries in total,
*09:42.980- 09:48.680* :  the Netherlands is speaking now. And then it will take the judges probably about six months to reach
*09:48.680- 09:54.100* :  their advisory opinion, which is not legally binding, but will carry huge political weight.
*09:54.920- 10:00.420* :  Anaholligan in the hake. More than a million Palestinians who've had to flee their homes are now
*10:00.420- 10:05.960* :  living in conditions of severe hardship in the south of the Gaza Strip. But some Israelis have
*10:05.960- 10:10.480* :  also felt the need to move both from areas near Gaza and from the north of Israel,
*10:10.900- 10:15.120* :  whereas Israeli troops and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon have been exchanging rocket fire.
*10:15.600- 10:20.540* :  Now some of these Israelis have been returning as our Middle East Correspondent Lucy Williamson reports.
*10:23.600- 10:26.320* :  Above the spacious veranda they use as a living room,
*10:26.780- 10:34.420* :  Ayelet and Shahar have hung a vast black flag, a show of solidarity with the hostages held in Gaza,
*10:35.220- 10:42.900* :  19 of them taken from here in Kafazar. Ayelet and Shahar are the first to return here full time.
*10:44.120- 10:48.580* :  More than 60 people were killed here when Hamas gunmen overran the kebuts.
*10:49.240- 10:55.420* :  Faith in Israel's ability to protect, left in tatters. We bought into the con. They
*10:55.820- 11:01.280* :  con us. Maybe they convinced themselves that what they're saying is the truth, but obviously
*11:01.460- 11:09.460* :  it wasn't. A lot will have to change. Since the October attacks, 200,000 people have been
*11:09.460- 11:14.820* :  displaced from Israel's borders. Some of them from northern areas close to Lebanon,
*11:15.380- 11:20.380* :  targeted by missiles from the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.
*11:22.280- 11:28.080* :  I'm looking out across the sea of Galilee and you can probably hear the rain around me that's
*11:28.080- 11:34.440* :  splashing into the swimming pool here at the holiday resort I'm standing in, surrounded by
*11:34.440- 11:40.360* :  holiday cottages. They've been inhabited for the past four months by the residents of the
*11:40.360- 11:47.040* :  communities up by the Lebanese border and now they say they want to go home. Michael Pihar,
*11:47.320- 11:52.320* :  a resident of kebuts, Sassar, says tolerance for life on the front line has shrunk.
*11:52.460- 11:58.940* :  Going back to something that we used to live that way is no longer an option. It's no longer an
*11:58.940- 12:05.740* :  option that we are under the threat of some guy in Beirut that would like to put the trigger
*12:05.740- 12:13.320* :  any time he likes. Israel says Hezbollah must retreat from the border before residents can return,
*12:13.380- 12:20.720* :  but diplomacy hasn't so far delivered results. Israel's war with Hamas has led some to say it should
*12:20.720- 12:27.380* :  take on Hezbollah too, but Hezbollah is a different kind of enemy and this would be a different
*12:27.380- 12:33.980* :  kind of war. In the border town of Hannita, a mortar fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon
*12:34.460- 12:40.280* :  has smashed through the top floor of a house. The army tells me its residents were evacuated
*12:40.280- 12:46.320* :  hours before. Lieutenant Colonel Dottan is a reservist with the army here. This is a war.
*12:46.940- 12:52.220* :  Our job is to make them come back. Hopefully it will provide enough security so they'll feel
*12:52.220- 12:58.140* :  secure to move back. My own personal family has been evacuated and my kids tell me we want to move
*12:58.140- 13:03.740* :  back to our home. Israel's government is under conflicting pressures over how to manage the
*13:03.740- 13:10.380* :  conflicts on its borders and how to get both its hostages and its residents home. Their empty
*13:10.380- 13:17.040* :  houses domestic hostages in this conflict for which Israel's government is paying a rising price.
*13:18.020- 13:21.000* :  Our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson with that report.
*13:22.220- 13:26.960* :  The Kremlin has hit back at claims made by the widow of the Russian opposition politician,
*13:26.960- 13:33.660* :  Alexei Navalny, that President Vladimir Putin was behind his death. Since Mr Navalny died in
*13:33.660- 13:39.200* :  prison last week, his family have been denied access to his body. Today, his mother released a
*13:39.200- 13:44.820* :  video appealing for the return of her son's body. Eastern European correspondent Sarah Reinsford
*13:44.820- 13:51.160* :  reports. Alexei Navalny's mother recorded this appeal in the thick snow outside the Arctic prison
*13:51.160- 13:56.560* :  where he died. For five days, she says she's been unable even to find out where his body is.
*13:57.180- 14:01.520* :  Now she's appealed to Vladimir Putin to intervene to get her son's body released
*14:01.520- 14:06.780* :  immediately for burial. Earlier in official tour, the family would take another two weeks,
*14:06.780- 14:12.520* :  as further tests were carried out. Navalny's team suspect the delay is deliberate to prevent
*14:12.520- 14:17.820* :  them learning the true cause of the politician's sudden death in prison. This video follows a
*14:17.820- 14:23.400* :  statement by Navalny's widow, Yulia, in which she accused Vladimir Putin directly of killing him.
*14:23.740- 14:28.240* :  Today, the Kremlin spokesman called those claims obnoxious and unsubstantiated.
*14:28.860- 14:32.720* :  He added that he'd say no more, as Yulia Navalny had just been widowed.
*14:33.500- 14:39.900* :  Sarah Reinsford. Meanwhile, the Russian Security Service, the FSB, says it has arrested a Russian
*14:39.900- 14:46.060* :  American Jewel citizen suspected of treason and raising funds for Ukraine. The 33-year-old
*14:46.060- 14:51.540* :  woman was detained in Russia's Urals region. She's understood to be a resident of Los Angeles and
*14:51.540- 14:57.340* :  stands accused of proactively collecting funds that would buy aid and military supplies for Ukraine.
*14:58.100- 15:03.420* :  Meanwhile, a Russian military pilot who defected to Ukraine last year has been killed in Spain.
*15:04.080- 15:07.840* :  Anna Foster heard more from Vitaly Shevchenko from BBC Monitoring.
*15:08.560- 15:13.820* :  The Russian Security Service, the FSB, did not name her and, as we've seen in video, her face
*15:13.820- 15:20.320* :  is almost completely concealed by her hat. But Russian independent journalists operating
*15:20.320- 15:28.880* :  from abroad, they say they have identified her as somebody who is originally from Ekaterin Boruk,
*15:29.260- 15:37.220* :  the city where she was arrested, and reportedly she later got married to an American national
*15:37.220- 15:44.340* :  and moved to Los Angeles. Now, the circumstances of her, the exact circumstances of her,
*15:44.460- 15:51.340* :  alleged wrongdoing are not clear. But some reports in Russia say that she supposedly transferred
*15:51.340- 16:02.820* :  less than $100 to a Ukrainian organization supporting the military. And she is not the first or
*16:02.820- 16:09.920* :  the only American citizen held in Russian jails. The most prominent of them is, of course,
*16:09.920- 16:17.860* :  Evan Gershkovic, the reporter for the Wall Street Journal who has been languishing in a Russian
*16:17.860- 16:25.520* :  jail for almost a year now, suspected of spying. And this morning a Russian court rejected his
*16:25.520- 16:33.260* :  appeal against pretrial detention. And President Putin, when he was speaking in an interview
*16:33.260- 16:41.860* :  earlier this month, he suggested that Evan Gershkovic might be exchanged for a Russian security
*16:41.860- 16:48.500* :  service assassin who is currently being held in jail in Germany. And let's move on as well to
*16:48.500- 16:54.660* :  that story. We also mentioned about this helicopter pilot who defected from Russia and has now been
*16:54.660- 17:05.260* :  found dead. Yes, Maxim Kuzminov was a Russian military pilot whose job was to transfer parts
*17:05.260- 17:13.340* :  for Russian jets. But in August last year he flew his helicopter across the border and enter
*17:13.340- 17:21.100* :  Ukraine under a scheme launched by the Ukrainian government called I Want to Live, which encourages
*17:21.760- 17:28.080* :  Russian soldiers to defect. And he was reportedly paid half a million dollars for what he did.
*17:28.560- 17:38.720* :  And now reports say that he has been found dead in an underground garage in Spain. And interestingly
*17:38.720- 17:46.520* :  Russian state TV, last October, broadcast a report saying that Russian security services had been
*17:46.520- 17:54.800* :  given the order to eliminate Mr. Kuzminov. And this morning commenting on his killing, the head of
*17:55.540- 18:01.740* :  Russian foreign intelligence service Ergen Erishkin said that Mr. Kuzminov had become a moral
*18:01.740- 18:09.160* :  corpse. That's a quote when he defected to Ukraine. Vitaly Shavchenko from BBC Monitoring.
*18:09.920- 18:15.060* :  Russia's Wagner mercenary group has long been shrouded in the sort of mystery that's the stock
*18:15.060- 18:20.820* :  in trade of spy novels. Semi-independent, conveniently deniable. There's been little doubt
*18:20.820- 18:26.420* :  that in the final analysis it's controlled by Vladimir Putin. The fate of its one-time leader,
*18:26.420- 18:31.600* :  Yefgeny Pregozhin, made that much clear. As soon as he got too big for his boots, briefly
*18:31.600- 18:37.520* :  challenging the authorities in Moscow, his days were numbered. Now a new report from one of Britain's
*18:37.520- 18:43.520* :  leading defence think tanks has shed light on the rebranded post-Pregozhin Wagner. Joe Inward has
*18:43.520- 18:49.140* :  been studying its findings. So they've basically found that post-Pregozhin Wagner has been broken into
*18:49.140- 18:53.400* :  two main sections, one called the volunteer corps. That's basically the bit of Wagner that was
*18:53.400- 18:57.940* :  operating in Ukraine. And then this thing was the expeditionary corps, which is basically their
*18:57.940- 19:04.000* :  operations in the rest of the world, primarily Africa. And it's being run by a man called Andrei
*19:04.000- 19:07.880* :  Afrianov. Now people might not know his name, but they'll know some of the things he's accused
*19:07.880- 19:12.640* :  of doing. This is the man, a general, who ran a Russian unit accused of being behind the
*19:12.640- 19:18.700* :  Salisbury Poisonings in the UK. And so what they've done is they've gone to the various African
*19:19.140- 19:23.460* :  nations and leaders where Wagner had an operation and said to them, right, you're now working
*19:23.460- 19:27.140* :  with us, you're working with a Russian state, this is coming in house, and they've been offering
*19:27.140- 19:32.880* :  them something called a regime survival package. And what does all this mean for the people of those
*19:32.880- 19:38.020* :  countries where Wagner operates? And what is this regime survival package? So regime survival
*19:38.020- 19:42.120* :  packages, basically the same sort of thing as was offered before where they give you
*19:42.500- 19:47.420* :  presidential guards, they give you informational warfare capabilities, and basically hard power
*19:47.420- 19:52.300* :  on the ground, hard Russian power. Now this means a number of things. Firstly, for the government's
*19:52.300- 19:55.680* :  in question, it means they're more likely to survive to maintain their position. And we're talking
*19:55.680- 20:00.240* :  about governments here who've often taken power through a coup, but also what it means for the
*20:00.240- 20:04.700* :  people on the ground. So say if you're a rebel group or you're some sort of dissident, you're
*20:04.700- 20:09.000* :  going to be coming up against hard Russian firepower. And I was speaking to Dr. Jack Wattling,
*20:09.000- 20:13.360* :  he's from Rusey and he wrote the report, and he said that the consequences of this can be
*20:13.360- 20:18.740* :  pretty terrible for people in these countries. They are using pretty traditional Soviet
*20:19.480- 20:26.000* :  anti-partisan methods. And so this is very violent. It's not indiscriminate because the intent
*20:26.000- 20:33.120* :  of targeting those civilians is terror. But it is the use of hard power to try and suppress
*20:33.120- 20:38.800* :  opposition to the government in countries that are relatively fragile and ethnically diverse.
*20:39.700- 20:43.580* :  And the ripples of this strategy spread far beyond Africa, don't they?
*20:43.820- 20:47.940* :  Yeah, absolutely. So this isn't just a question of them taking natural resources,
*20:47.940- 20:52.660* :  which is the way that they operate. They will acquire the kind of the mineral rights and
*20:52.660- 20:57.880* :  to various valuable commodities in Africa. But what they're also doing is trying to
*20:57.880- 21:02.480* :  displace Western interests because there are things, partly there are things like timber and
*21:02.480- 21:06.460* :  gold, they're just valuable, but there are other things like lithium or uranium, which are
*21:06.460- 21:11.160* :  strategically important. And I spoke to a man called Christopher Steele, he's a former British spy
*21:11.220- 21:17.980* :  looking at Russia. And he said that the techniques they might use could also cynically
*21:17.980- 21:23.800* :  manipulate the populations of these countries. One of the really kind of resonant issues here
*21:23.800- 21:29.040* :  in the last few years has been mass migration from Africa and from the Middle East into Europe,
*21:29.080- 21:34.280* :  which has created this kind of populist right-wing backlash, people like Victor Orbán and Hungary
*21:34.280- 21:38.200* :  and so on. And I think that this is where they're coming from. I think this is part of
*21:38.540- 21:43.560* :  their thinking the Russians in terms of this type of warfare going forward. And I think their
*21:43.560- 21:48.540* :  ability to turn off and on the tap of migration into Europe from places like West Africa
*21:49.040- 21:56.160* :  will be significant going forward. Joe Inward. Still to come in this podcast.

*22:03.640- 22:09.540* :  black hole that is emitting all of this light. The most luminous object ever detected has been
*22:09.540- 22:21.360* :  spied in the distant universe. In 1969, a plan to show support for an anti-racism protest
*22:21.360- 22:28.040* :  turned the lives of 14 promising black student athletes upside down. I don't think we realize
*22:28.040- 22:35.440* :  what the true flavor of Wyoming was back in 1969. Amazing sport stories from the BBC World Service
*22:35.520- 22:40.960* :  tells the story of the black 14. There was a rebel, confederate flag being flown.
*22:40.960- 22:46.560* :  It was different. It was definitely different. Search for amazing sport stories wherever you get

*22:56.640- 23:02.720* :  making another bid to halt his extradition to the US in London today. The 52-year-old has spent
*23:02.720- 23:08.600* :  the last five years in London's Belmarsh Prison after he was accused of publishing leaked military
*23:08.600- 23:13.980* :  documents. Our correspondent Nikki Schiller has been outside the high court where a very loud
*23:13.980- 23:19.160* :  gathering of Julian Assange's supporters have been listening to speeches including from his wife.
*23:19.720- 23:25.540* :  For the last five years Julian Assange has been fighting extradition to the US to face trial over
*23:25.540- 23:32.580* :  leaking military secrets. It actually all began back in 2010 when WikiLeaks disclosed huge numbers
*23:32.580- 23:38.740* :  of military files about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That included footage of a US helicopter
*23:38.740- 23:46.380* :  gunning down civilians in Baghdad. Now the US says that that put lives at risk and they want him to
*23:46.380- 23:53.440* :  face 18 charges under the Espionage Act. Julian Assange says it's all politically motivated and he
*23:53.440- 24:00.580* :  has just exposed wrongdoing. Now you'll remember for a while Mr Assange refuge in the Ecuadorian
*24:00.580- 24:07.160* :  Embassy but he was eventually arrested in 2019 and since then been in Belmarsh Prison. There's
*24:07.160- 24:15.020* :  been a number of legal cases where his team argued that if he was extradited to the United States
*24:15.020- 24:20.320* :  he would be at risk because he might harm himself. Now the US then gave assurances that that
*24:20.320- 24:27.540* :  wouldn't happen. In 2021 the high court ruled that the extradition could go ahead and then in 2022
*24:27.540- 24:33.980* :  the Supreme Court upheld that ruling and then the then-home secretary in Britain pretty
*24:33.980- 24:42.860* :  put help signed that order allowing the extradition and now where we are today is that his team
*24:43.320- 24:49.800* :  are beginning a two-day high court hearing and they're going to argue that he should be
*24:50.020- 24:54.980* :  allowed to appeal against that decision of the home secretary to extradite him.
*24:57.500- 25:02.600* :  His wife has just arrived and spoken to the Crown saying that it was a big day ahead and they
*25:02.600- 25:09.060* :  didn't know what to expect but she said the world is watching. We have two big days ahead.
*25:10.980- 25:16.560* :  We don't know what to expect but you're here because the world is watching.
*25:18.280- 25:20.020* :  They have to know they can't get away with this.
*25:22.460- 25:26.860* :  Julian needs his freedom and we all need the truth. Thank you.
*25:31.900- 25:36.960* :  And then lawyers of Assange have said that if they lose this they'll take it to the European court
*25:36.960- 25:43.260* :  of human rights. Well yes that is what they are saying so basically there's lawyers say if he
*25:43.260- 25:50.420* :  is extradited he is convicted. He faces up to 175 years in prison and the US government
*25:50.420- 25:56.720* :  denied that and say that it would only be four to six years. Now the hearing today and tomorrow
*25:56.720- 26:03.200* :  if it is rejected then there is a possibility that his team can go to the European court of rights
*26:03.200- 26:10.180* :  to what is known as look for a royal rule 39 order that is to temporarily stop the plane
*26:10.180- 26:18.160* :  from taking off. Nicky Schiller outside the high court. Doctors in South Korea have gone on strike
*26:18.160- 26:23.720* :  over plans to increase the number of medical students. The medics fear the government's proposals
*26:23.720- 26:29.500* :  could eventually see their salary squeezed. These residents of Seoul are worried about the impact
*26:29.500- 26:38.220* :  of the strike. If doctors go on strike my daughter's surgery might be delayed and the treatment period
*26:38.220- 26:44.400* :  might become even longer. So I'm very worried about it. I hope the situation will be resolved.
*26:47.060- 26:53.340* :  I feel like they're using sick people as an excuse. I hope doctors and the government find some
*26:53.340- 26:59.440* :  compromise and they quickly return to their posts so that patients don't miss their treatment.
*27:02.420- 27:07.880* :  I put it to our Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristo that the doctors weren't exactly endearing
*27:07.880- 27:13.220* :  themselves to patients. Well you're right it hasn't endeared them to their patients. The majority
*27:13.220- 27:19.360* :  of people in South Korea are in favor of this government plan which essentially would increase
*27:19.360- 27:27.200* :  the number of trainee doctors each year from 3000 to 5000 and South Korea does have a shortage
*27:27.460- 27:34.960* :  of medical staff of doctors particularly. The average per 1000 population is about 3.7 doctors
*27:34.960- 27:41.680* :  that's in developed countries in South Korea it's just 2.5. So there seems to be a need for this
*27:42.100- 27:48.220* :  but doctors have gone on strike. Thousands of them mostly trainee doctors have handed in their
*27:48.220- 27:54.020* :  resignations. They're saying this won't solve the problem the problems at the health care
*27:54.020- 28:01.460* :  service faces in South Korea. Notably a lot of doctors shortage of doctors in rural areas. They
*28:01.460- 28:07.600* :  say they haven't been consulted and they've got a number of other complaints but on the face of it
*28:07.600- 28:14.560* :  is difficult to see why so many more doctors it is a bad thing in South Korea indeed in anywhere.
*28:15.300- 28:19.060* :  And what's the immediate impact likely to be as far as patients are concerned?
*28:20.060- 28:26.300* :  Well you used the word there immediate there's already been an impact immediately. Surgery
*28:26.300- 28:32.500* :  operations have been cancelled. At the moment I think there's about just under 2000 doctors who have
*28:32.680- 28:41.420* :  walked out many more threatening to join them. The government is saying it has a legal right to
*28:41.420- 28:48.560* :  force some doctors back to work because they're in a reserved profession that they can't strike.
*28:48.560- 28:54.500* :  So as easily as other professions and other working people but at the moment it's already starting
*28:54.500- 29:01.020* :  to affect and of course the fear is this strike continues in the days and perhaps weeks to come
*29:01.020- 29:06.120* :  that the effect on medical, the medical services in South Korea will be even greater.
*29:06.860- 29:13.500* :  Mickey Bristol scientists believe they've identified the brightest ever object detected in the
*29:13.500- 29:19.280* :  known universe and it's being caused by an enormous black hole. The team say it's probably
*29:19.280- 29:25.360* :  being visible in the night sky for longer than humans have existed but has only just been identified
*29:25.360- 29:32.060* :  as a quasar the burning centre of an active galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole.
*29:32.680- 29:38.780* :  This one is said to be as bright as 500 trillion suns but is so far away from the earth that
*29:38.780- 29:44.480* :  its light has taken 12 billion years to reach us. Christian Wolfe is an associate professor of
*29:44.480- 29:50.200* :  astrophysics at the Australian National University and part of the team who made the discovery.
*29:50.980- 29:57.300* :  Black hole means it's supposed to be black it's when you concentrate a mass so much that
*29:57.300- 30:02.980* :  near its surface the force of gravity would be so strong that not even light can escape.
*30:02.980- 30:09.360* :  That makes it black and that's still true here but what is different is that this black hole is not
*30:09.360- 30:16.220* :  just a sleeping giant in the darkness of the universe but it actually eats matter as we watch it
*30:16.240- 30:24.400* :  and loads and loads of matter in fact around about one sun worth of material every single day.
*30:25.140- 30:32.820* :  So when this matter gets close to the black hole it gets dragged into a giant disk and that's
*30:32.880- 30:37.820* :  like a holding pattern for all the material that the black hole will eventually devour
*30:38.480- 30:44.600* :  and in this disk all the material rubs up against all the other material there are magnetic fields
*30:44.600- 30:51.360* :  running they are breaking down there is lots of lightning flashes there's a lot of heat generated
*30:51.400- 30:56.860* :  and it's the radiation from this accretion disk that we see so it's not literally the black hole
*30:57.180- 31:03.760* :  it's the black holes meal in the making that is being basically presented on a plate to the black
*31:03.760- 31:09.600* :  hole that is emitting all of this light. Christian Wolfe from the Australian National University
*31:12.840- 31:17.760* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later
*31:18.260- 31:23.260* :  I just have time to tell you about a request from our happy pod colleagues do you live in the
