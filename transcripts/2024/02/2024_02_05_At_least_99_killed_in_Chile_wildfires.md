*00:54.620- 00:59.300* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Monday the 5th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:00.020- 01:05.360* :  Around 100 people have been killed in forest fires in Chile amid warnings that that number could
*01:05.360- 01:11.040* :  rise even higher. The US says its air strikes against Iranian-backed militants in the Middle East
*01:11.040- 01:17.700* :  have been effective but insists more attacks are still needed. Voters in Paris have approved a plan
*01:17.700- 01:24.160* :  to triple parking fees for people from outside the city if they drive SUVs in the French capital.
*01:27.220- 01:35.720* :  Also in this podcast, while Leonel Messi was booed by his own fans.
*01:41.440- 01:45.860* :  Central Chile is on fire. While fires are sweeping through the region of our
*01:45.860- 01:52.200* :  Pariso amid an intense summer heat wave and prolonged drought, the flames have been devouring
*01:52.200- 01:59.380* :  forests and houses on hillside's overlooking towns. As we record this podcast, around 100 people
*01:59.380- 02:04.600* :  have died and there appears that number could rise further still. These people living in the coastal
*02:04.600- 02:13.480* :  town of Vina del Mar have lost their homes. From one moment to the next, the fire reached the botanical
*02:13.480- 02:21.520* :  park. In 10 minutes, the fire was already on us. There was smoke. The sky turned black. Everything
*02:21.520- 02:30.840* :  was dark. The wind felt like a hurricane. It was like being in hell. We need help. Food for our pets,
*02:30.880- 02:37.520* :  supplies, clothes. I don't know. My house. I lost everything. Everything.
*02:38.380- 02:43.380* :  Well, as firefighters continue to battle the blazes, President Gabriel Borich has declared
*02:43.380- 02:49.920* :  a state of emergency. In a nationwide TV address, he said rescuers were doing all they could to save
*02:49.920- 03:00.220* :  lives. We have said it and we repeat it. Today's priority is to save lives as there are still active
*03:00.220- 03:06.940* :  fires. Assist the injured people and as quickly as possible to quell the active fires that are now
*03:06.940- 03:14.200* :  being battled. Graciella Ibanez is a journalist who lives in Vina del Mar, one of the worst affected
*03:14.200- 03:22.660* :  towns. Friday afternoon, it was crazy. We could see a big, big smoke all over the city and it was
*03:22.660- 03:29.840* :  a sunny day and very windy too. So you could see the contrast between the smoke and the sky, the blue
*03:30.140- 03:37.560* :  sky and it just turned worse than worse over the hours. Now it's a little bit calmer. Thank God.
*03:38.000- 03:43.980* :  And had those wildfires reached the outskirts of the city? Yes, part of the city has been burned,
*03:44.060- 03:53.640* :  some 25% of the urban area of the city has burned and neighboring municipalities like Kilboe or
*03:53.640- 04:00.520* :  Casablanca also in the Valparaiso region, which is a coastal region. So houses have been destroyed,
*04:00.520- 04:08.720* :  people have been made homeless? Yes, there might be some 5,000 homes destroyed in Vina del Mar,
*04:08.720- 04:15.320* :  that means around 12,000 people without homes and because it's summer, people are on vacation,
*04:15.360- 04:21.780* :  so there are no kids going to school. There are a lot of tourists right now in the city and the local
*04:21.780- 04:28.420* :  people are being helped by the local government and the central government too. So what's been done to
*04:28.420- 04:35.520* :  fight these wildfires? So there have been firefighters from the city and neighboring cities,
*04:35.920- 04:42.220* :  there are also other fires in the country, this is the season unfortunately. There's been a lot of
*04:42.220- 04:49.340* :  help from fire departments from around the area and from other cities. Today the day was
*04:49.360- 04:56.840* :  more humid, colder, so that has helped to decrease the fires. You say this is the season for wildfires,
*04:56.840- 05:02.340* :  so are these spontaneous or are there suggestions that some of them may have been started deliberately?
*05:02.800- 05:10.060* :  The governor of the Valparaiso region said the fires were intentionally caused and the same
*05:10.060- 05:17.500* :  things said the superintendent of the Valparaiso fire department. So they're going to
*05:17.500- 05:24.160* :  pursue legal actions to identify these people. You've also got the El Ni√±o weather phenomenon. I
*05:24.160- 05:31.240* :  just wondered whether the climate was changing in Chile. Yes, yes, so we're in the dry season,
*05:31.240- 05:37.940* :  but this dry season has been longer than usual, so the air is drier, less humid that it should
*05:37.960- 05:42.820* :  be, so all of that is contributing to the expansion of the fire.
*05:47.740- 05:53.200* :  The White House National Security Advisor has said the US will press on with its retaliation
*05:53.200- 05:58.180* :  against Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria and Houthi fighters in Yemen.
*05:58.900- 06:03.480* :  Jake Sullivan told American television that airstrikes against the Houthis had reduced their
*06:03.480- 06:09.540* :  ability to attack ships in the Red Sea. Mr. Sullivan also said the US might carry out further
*06:09.540- 06:15.960* :  strikes in retaliation for the deadly attack a week ago on US troops in Jordan when three US
*06:15.960- 06:22.460* :  personnel died. It began with the strikes on Friday night, but that is not the end of it.
*06:22.720- 06:28.620* :  We intend to take additional strikes and additional action to continue to send a clear message
*06:28.620- 06:32.940* :  that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked or people are killed.
*06:33.880- 06:38.280* :  Funeral have been held in Baghdad after 17 people were killed in those US strikes.
*06:38.280- 06:42.900* :  Our senior international correspondent, Oleg Erin, reports from the Iraqi capital.
*06:46.040- 06:51.300* :  In Baghdad today, a fleet of ambulances carried those killed by the US,
*06:52.200- 06:59.800* :  17 fighters from militias backed by Eran. Officially, they are part of Iraq's security forces,
*07:00.560- 07:08.060* :  but in many ways they are foot soldiers for Tehran. The US strikes have caused anger here.
*07:08.720- 07:13.400* :  The government saying they have threatened the security of Iraq and the region.
*07:15.860- 07:22.940* :  A red line was crossed by targeting our forces, says Fala Al-Fayad, leader of the militias.
*07:23.620- 07:33.320* :  This must not be repeated. And the chant from the crowd, America is the greatest devil.
*07:34.140- 07:38.900* :  They want US forces out.
*07:39.520- 07:45.680* :  These men have come to mourn and to honor their dead victims of American bombing raids,
*07:45.680- 07:51.460* :  but there is also a message in all of this. It's a show of strength, a show of unity,
*07:52.220- 07:57.740* :  and a warning to the United States. We are here and we're not going anywhere.
*07:57.980- 08:04.280* :  But the mood was muted and there were no fiery threats of retaliation.
*08:06.160- 08:11.360* :  Eran doesn't want an escalation in the tit for tat, neither does Washington.
*08:12.560- 08:18.000* :  While the war rages in Gaza, one false move could set the region alive.
*08:19.880- 08:25.060* :  That report by Oleg Erin. Meanwhile, Egypt says revenue from the Suez Canal
*08:25.060- 08:30.140* :  plunged by almost half in January. The constant Houthi attacks since November
*08:30.140- 08:33.740* :  have forced major shipping companies to avoid the waterway.
*08:34.080- 08:35.860* :  Electra Naseemith has this report.
*08:36.800- 08:41.400* :  Egypt says income from the Suez Canal last month was just under $430 million.
*08:42.220- 08:45.600* :  That's down from $800 million in the same period last year.
*08:46.040- 08:49.000* :  The number of ships is also down by more than a third.
*08:49.560- 08:52.860* :  It's a sign that Houthi attacks are affecting not just commercial shipping,
*08:52.860- 08:56.920* :  but Egyptian coffers. Suez is a vital source of foreign income,
*08:57.320- 09:01.520* :  raising more than $10 billion last year for Egypt's already teetering economy.
*09:02.520- 09:09.060* :  Electra Naseemith voters in a referendum in Paris have approved a plan to triple parking fees
*09:09.060- 09:15.080* :  for people from outside the city if they drive SUVs in the French capital. Sales have
*09:15.080- 09:20.960* :  soared for SUVs and pickups much higher and wider than the average saloon. Socialists and
*09:20.960- 09:26.460* :  greens in the French capital say when parked in the city's narrow streets, these large vehicles
*09:26.460- 09:32.200* :  make it difficult or even impossible for other cars and bikes to squeeze by safely.
*09:32.200- 09:39.180* :  John Lawrence in reports. On Paris is pretty left back in a narrow street called
*09:39.180- 09:48.040* :  rather wonderfully Rumadam or Mrs Street. A giant white Volvo XC90 hybrid glides
*09:48.040- 09:55.540* :  noiselessly into a parking space. Well I say in the back end is more out. Inside a young mother
*09:55.540- 10:00.680* :  and her 10-year-old son she gets out and asks me if I know where the nearest parking meter is.
*10:00.980- 10:09.780* :  I say funny you should say that and we get talking. New charges will apply to fossil fuel
*10:09.780- 10:17.520* :  cars over 1.6 tons and e-cars over two tons so she will have to pay. She says the charge is
*10:17.520- 10:25.280* :  unfair because she doesn't really have a choice. We didn't get this car to drive in Paris which I
*10:25.280- 10:31.780* :  don't do very often but because we have big dog so for long journeys we came to the plane and
*10:31.780- 10:38.560* :  it's difficult to take the train. This is our way of traveling. I mentioned this lady when on the
*10:38.560- 10:44.200* :  steps of the Ompra House in one of the areas where Paris traffic is densest. I meet up with
*10:44.200- 10:51.120* :  Tony Renucci, executive director of the anti-air pollution non-profit Respire Breathe in English.
*10:51.820- 10:56.600* :  They always have an excuse he matters. He thinks this referendum is a great idea.
*10:57.240- 11:04.900* :  It'll be a very strong and powerful signal to car makers to tell them stop doing SUV.
*11:05.720- 11:09.160* :  Now you have to focus on smaller and electric vehicles.
*11:10.540- 11:14.780* :  Down in the metro, which is how, says Tony Renucci, people should get around.
*11:16.500- 11:23.020* :  With Philippe Nosierre, president of a non-profit called 40 million motorists says this is not
*11:23.020- 11:27.460* :  always possible and that this referendum is fundamentally unfair.
*11:30.220- 11:35.500* :  As usual, Mayor Annie Dalgour is getting perissions to vote but perissions mostly don't have cars
*11:35.980- 11:40.660* :  and when they do, one be made to pay higher parking charges if they stay in a district where they live.
*11:41.460- 11:46.140* :  It's people who live in the suburbs who don't get to vote in this referendum who often need their
*11:46.140- 11:53.100* :  cars to get into town and who will have to pay this tax. Mayor I dalgour has already drastically
*11:53.100- 11:58.700* :  limited the space given to cars in this town by cutting street parking places and extending
*11:58.700- 12:03.920* :  cycle and bus lanes. She's limited access to the city for older, more polluting cars,
*12:04.540- 12:09.760* :  increased the price of car parking, introduced parking charges for motorised two wheelers
*12:10.180- 12:17.260* :  and imposed a speed limit of 19 miles an hour on most roads. For people out on the streets of
*12:17.320- 12:23.380* :  Paris, this new measure is either bitty screen metaphor time, the cherry on the cake or takes the
*12:23.380- 12:30.800* :  biscuit. I think it's fair. I have a big car. I always have things that need moving, plants,
*12:30.800- 12:35.980* :  trees and so on, so I need my SUV. But if you have a big car, you have to bear the consequences.
*12:37.660- 12:43.260* :  I am in favour of letting people live their lives when it comes to things like this.
*12:43.880- 12:45.200* :  Leave people in peace.
*12:46.480- 12:52.280* :  Residents of Paris speaking to a reporter John Lawrence Nere. Now this is a sound that football
*12:52.280- 12:56.440* :  legend Lionel Messi doesn't normally hear from his own fans.
*13:01.580- 13:06.680* :  But that was a reaction he got in Hong Kong when fans who spent days eagerly looking forward to
*13:06.680- 13:11.800* :  their team's match with Messi's club into Miami were instead treated to the side of him sitting
*13:11.800- 13:16.840* :  on the bench. Some of them demanded their money back. I've been a Messi fan since I was very little
*13:18.040- 13:21.960* :  and I really hurt me tonight. I was very excited to see him play. It was going to be my first time
*13:21.960- 13:28.700* :  ever seeing him play. We're very disappointed. I wish I didn't come. We came for Messi and
*13:28.700- 13:34.880* :  Messi wasn't here and you can't do this to the fans. Yeah, I wish we didn't come and I'm sure a lot
*13:34.880- 13:40.480* :  of people feel the same way. Our Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristol told us how Messi
*13:40.480- 13:49.020* :  Mania turned into just a plain mess. This was a really much anticipated match. Tickets for this game
*13:49.020- 13:54.660* :  had sold out within an hour back in December and everybody was looking forward to seeing Messi.
*13:55.500- 13:59.880* :  He plays through into Miami, team in the United States, but it was him that they'd come to see
*13:59.880- 14:04.880* :  essentially. On Saturday, thousands of them had gathered at the training center just to watch
*14:04.880- 14:12.020* :  him train. Some fans had also gone to the hotel, real kind of mania, football craze in Hong Kong.
*14:12.260- 14:18.100* :  They turned up. He didn't play at all. He spent the whole match sitting on the substitute bench
*14:18.180- 14:23.140* :  and people were getting quite angry towards the end and kind of chanting saying they wanted
*14:23.140- 14:28.700* :  their money back, refund, demanded that many Messi get up on the pitch and play. So they were quite
*14:28.700- 14:33.340* :  angry about it. Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it? Because at the end they were booing. They booed the
*14:33.340- 14:39.180* :  co-owner of into Miami, David Beckham. What's into Miami's explanation for the fact that Leonel
*14:39.180- 14:44.440* :  Messi didn't even make a cameo appearance? Essentially they said he was injured. So the coach came to
*14:44.440- 14:50.400* :  try and assuage all these fans who were angry at Messi, not appearing saying he was injured.
*14:51.000- 14:55.940* :  They're on a big pre-season tour at the moment. They played in Saudi Arabia a few days ago.
*14:55.940- 14:59.840* :  I think he only had a few minutes there. They're then going on to Japan and then back to
*15:00.300- 15:05.940* :  America where the season, the football season begins again. Later on this month, so
*15:06.260- 15:11.280* :  presumably they want to get in fit for real competition rather than just a pre-season exhibition
*15:11.340- 15:17.380* :  match. But of course, if you've paid hundreds and hundreds of dollars for tickets, which some people
*15:17.380- 15:22.160* :  have, some are even floating from Australia, from other parts of China to come and watch this
*15:22.160- 15:27.940* :  match, that's not something that an excuse that you would necessarily be happy with. You'd
*15:27.940- 15:33.160* :  want that excuse before the match, not after it. Yeah, if you watched some of the promotional video
*15:33.160- 15:39.200* :  before, the team when they arrived at Hong Kong Airport, there was a photo shoot with the
*15:39.200- 15:44.080* :  messes there in the middle and on billboards across Hong Kong, you see adverts for this match.
*15:44.080- 15:51.620* :  There he is, Messi, Fronten Center, even a junk, a traditional Chinese sailing ship in Victoria,
*15:51.620- 15:57.300* :  Harbour in Hong Kong, had sails with messes face on it. So obviously the implication is that
*15:57.820- 16:02.620* :  he's going to be here. He's going to be playing. So of course, fans are quite angry, they want
*16:02.620- 16:07.060* :  the money back and incidentally the local authorities in Hong Kong who've given about two million
*16:07.840- 16:12.880* :  dollars in sponsorship, they're saying that they might want their money back as well. Mickey

*17:13.500- 17:20.100* :  grandfather and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*17:20.220- 17:27.660* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
*17:28.700- 17:35.080* :  I'm Una Chaplin and from CBC Podcasts and the BBC World Service, this is Hollywood Exiles.

*17:40.640- 17:46.000* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. On Sunday, a day after Senegal's president suddenly
*17:46.000- 17:51.500* :  called off this month's election just hours before campaigning was due to begin, protests erupted
*17:51.500- 17:57.460* :  in the capital Dacca, police fired tear gas demonstrators and carried out arrests. Some
*17:57.460- 18:02.040* :  opposition leaders have expressed their concerns, the president is trying to illegally cling onto
*18:02.040- 18:07.740* :  power. Khalifa Sal is a presidential candidate for the coalition Tara Wu Senegal.
*18:11.080- 18:16.160* :  Never in Senegal's political history have we seen a situation like this. It's a dangerous
*18:16.160- 18:22.600* :  president to be able to postpone a presidential election on the eve of its start is unprecedented.
*18:24.860- 18:30.800* :  The US and the West African Regional Block ECOS have called for a new date to be set as soon as
*18:30.880- 18:35.440* :  possible. Our African Regional Editor will Ross told us more about the protests.
*18:36.420- 18:42.520* :  Not huge in size, but possibly a warning of what's to come. Not just young men,
*18:42.520- 18:46.820* :  which is usually the demographic for the kinds of people that get out on the streets and express
*18:46.820- 18:53.500* :  their anger at the politicians. This time, men and women of a variety of ages. Some of them
*18:53.500- 18:58.920* :  set up barricades, sort of setting fire to tires, clearly angered by this decision to
*18:59.360- 19:05.600* :  postpone the elections. And then the police responded with tear gas and dispersed the crowds,
*19:05.600- 19:11.900* :  chased some of them and made some arrests. We've heard that Aminata Torre, who's a former prime
*19:11.900- 19:18.520* :  minister, are now opposition figure, she was arrested. And as was one of the presidential candidates
*19:18.520- 19:25.140* :  and to Babakart and Gom. So we are expecting more protests. There have been some called for
*19:25.140- 19:30.400* :  Monday outside the parliament. And I think this is just sort of taste of the kind of anger that
*19:30.400- 19:35.980* :  is likely to swirl around now in Senegal. Has the president explained his decision to call
*19:35.980- 19:42.260* :  off the election so suddenly? Well, he says it's all to do with this political dispute over who's
*19:42.260- 19:47.800* :  allowed to run in the election. Many, many candidates put their names forward and then judges
*19:47.800- 19:54.100* :  from a constitutional council ruled out many of them for a variety of reasons. Twenty were allowed
*19:54.100- 20:00.720* :  to go through. But of the people who were blocked from running, there's, for example, Karim Wad,
*20:00.720- 20:06.460* :  who's the son of a former president, Abdelay Wad, he was deemed to be a dual national and so
*20:06.460- 20:13.840* :  was blocked. So he actually tried to get the election postponed. So basically this suggestion that
*20:13.840- 20:19.080* :  the judges who were deciding who should be on the ballot paper did the wrong thing and didn't
*20:19.080- 20:24.940* :  do it in a proper way. That's led to a political row. And Mackie Sal says he's postponed it so
*20:24.940- 20:31.480* :  that it can be a calm and free and fair election. Well, Ross, to an extraordinary story now from
*20:31.480- 20:37.900* :  Baltimore in the United States and an impressively close, life-saving mother-daughter relationship.
*20:37.980- 20:44.640* :  When 71-year-old Julia Harland's liver began to fail, doctors told her she needed a transplant
*20:44.640- 20:51.580* :  as soon as possible to save her life, but because of her age was unlikely to get one. Her 39-year-old
*20:51.580- 20:56.900* :  daughter, Eileen, stepped in to find out if she was a match for her mother, but that was only the
*20:56.900- 21:04.240* :  beginning of what turned into an extremely rare double transplant. Rebecca Kesby has been speaking
*21:04.280- 21:08.920* :  to them first to Eileen. Did she tell her mother that she was being tested for a transplant?
*21:10.080- 21:15.780* :  No, so I didn't. She had always said, I said initially, when we knew she needed the transplant. I was
*21:15.780- 21:21.360* :  like, oh, mom, I'll be your donor if I can. She's like, absolutely not. So a month or two had gone by
*21:21.360- 21:29.340* :  and she was just in excruciating discomfort. And it took probably four months for me to complete
*21:29.340- 21:35.580* :  everything. It's like an extensive amount of blood work. I felt so relieved to have it done
*21:36.140- 21:42.220* :  and be a match. I was smiling year to year. I was so incredibly happy. And then you had the
*21:42.220- 21:48.300* :  business of telling your mom and dealing with her reaction, how did that go? I knew I was going to
*21:48.300- 21:53.700* :  be seeing my mom that Sunday for Mother's Day. So I sat down with them and I told them and I know
*21:53.700- 21:58.600* :  her and my dad started crying and it was emotional. I mean, I was in shock to tell you the truth.
*21:58.800- 22:02.980* :  You must have felt very loved, though, to know that Eileen had gone through all of this.
*22:04.240- 22:10.820* :  So tell us about that operation because this is a seriously involved, quite dangerous
*22:10.820- 22:17.280* :  operation, I think, is it? Right. And it's quite long, too. They said I was in, I see you for
*22:17.280- 22:23.420* :  two or three days or something. Eileen, how did you feel after that operation?
*22:23.420- 22:29.240* :  I've looked to me like I was nine months pregnant. Like I was so swollen. My belly was so big
*22:29.820- 22:35.020* :  because when they cut you, they cut under your breastbone all the way down past your belly
*22:35.020- 22:41.320* :  buttons. So what listeners won't possibly know yet is that this was only the beginning of the
*22:41.320- 22:47.980* :  story because right after this, there's a whole other operation that has to happen. And this time
*22:47.980- 22:57.060* :  Julia, you needed a kidney. It came out of the blue. I had just passed my one year anniversary from
*22:57.060- 23:05.340* :  having the first transplant. And my coordinator from my liver transplant, she called and she said
*23:05.340- 23:12.940* :  your creatin score is going up. And they finally come up with, oh, you need a kidney transplant.
*23:13.880- 23:21.840* :  So this is where Eileen comes in and comes to the rescue again, because Eileen, you donated one
*23:21.840- 23:31.060* :  of your kidneys to Julia. Was that a difficult decision? No, two of my other siblings did try to
*23:31.060- 23:37.520* :  apply for the kidney and they unfortunately were not matches for her. And so the recovery for that?
*23:37.520- 23:43.720* :  We were out of the hospital in two days. I mean, it was significantly easier than the liver for sure.
*23:44.020- 23:49.500* :  Did any of your siblings or wider family members have worries about this or have they all been
*23:49.520- 23:55.920* :  supportive? I think that they were nervous for sure, but I was determined to do it. So I wasn't
*23:55.920- 24:00.300* :  listening. I didn't care. I love her and I'm so happy to have more years with her.
*24:01.680- 24:08.940* :  Eileen and Julia Harlan there. Now this might make you feel old. Facebook celebrated its 20th
*24:08.940- 24:13.680* :  birthday of the weekend. It's grown from a network for Harvard University students to one of the
*24:13.680- 24:18.700* :  biggest online platforms in the world. But as concern has grown about the way it operates,
*24:18.700- 24:24.300* :  for instance, making vast profits from harvesting our personal data or being used as a political
*24:24.300- 24:31.140* :  tool in elections, there are growing calls for its influence to be curved. So after 20 years,
*24:31.140- 24:37.240* :  is Facebook seen as a force for bad or good? Laurent Taylor has been discussing the influence
*24:37.240- 24:41.680* :  of Facebook with Fred Turner, a professor of communication at Stanford University.
*24:42.620- 24:47.140* :  I'd say that Facebook is to the last 20 years what television and radio were to the previous
*24:47.140- 24:52.320* :  100. The impact has been extraordinary. It's been a leading social medium. It arrived with the
*24:52.320- 24:56.600* :  promise that it would bring us a world of global interconnection kind of the promise of a global
*24:56.600- 25:01.720* :  village. And in fact, it's brought us challenges to democracy, the acceleration of rumor,
*25:01.720- 25:06.620* :  its fuel revolutions. It's had an enormous impact. Things have changed something with social media
*25:06.620- 25:10.460* :  because sometimes it's about what we choose to look at, but it's sometimes also driven by algorithms
*25:10.460- 25:14.420* :  isn't it? How much difference does that make? Well, the algorithms are very important, but they're
*25:14.420- 25:19.000* :  really driven by the business model. And the business model is keep people on the site at all
*25:19.000- 25:24.080* :  times at all costs. That's what algorithms do. Algorithms are designed to track your behavior,
*25:24.080- 25:28.340* :  follow what you're doing, and give you more of what you want. And that tends to produce kind of
*25:28.340- 25:32.780* :  spirals and filter bubbles within which a person can get kind of locked. Tell me about the way
*25:32.780- 25:36.360* :  Facebook might play during an election year. I mean, in the past, obviously it's these things
*25:36.360- 25:41.160* :  have had an influence, but how about now, does social media and places like Facebook really make
*25:41.160- 25:44.540* :  a big difference when it comes to elections? They make a very big difference. They make it in two
*25:44.540- 25:48.740* :  ways. One, they make it at the kind of individual level. You know, when you go on social media,
*25:48.740- 25:52.980* :  you are in some sense alone, but you're in a world where there are lots of other folks talking to one
*25:52.980- 25:56.880* :  another where there are folks trying to manipulate your opinions and where you're trying to seek
*25:56.920- 26:01.240* :  information that confirms the biases you already have. That's a human trait. We're all going to be
*26:01.240- 26:06.120* :  doing that. At the same time, we're going to be living in a world where state actors, non-state
*26:06.140- 26:11.020* :  actors are trying to influence our opinions. And Facebook is the royal road for propaganda. You
*26:11.020- 26:16.520* :  can set propaganda machines on fire in Facebook in ways that transform people's opinions. And
*26:16.540- 26:20.240* :  it's a pretty powerful mix. Where do you think it's going for Facebook? What would you predict
*26:20.240- 26:24.700* :  for the next sort of save 10 years? There's a lot of talk about how Facebook as a company is not
*26:24.700- 26:28.700* :  holding on to younger users and younger users are going elsewhere. I think they've been extremely
*26:28.700- 26:33.100* :  savvy about buying up firms like Instagram and integrating those into the larger enterprise.
*26:33.100- 26:37.300* :  So I think Facebook's going to be with us for quite a while. I may be the last one to say it,
*26:37.300- 26:40.140* :  but I think Facebook is the Chevrolet or Ford of social media.
*26:41.260- 26:48.060* :  Professor Fred Turner. A Russian cosmonaut has set a new world record for the most time spent
*26:48.060- 26:54.440* :  in space. Oleg Kononenko, who's months away from his 60th birthday, clocked up a cumulative
*26:54.440- 27:02.420* :  total of more than 878 days outside the Earth's atmosphere. The equivalent of nearly two and a half
*27:02.420- 27:08.720* :  years breaking the record held by another Russian cosmonaut. With more on his gravity-defying
*27:08.720- 27:19.660* :  achievement, here's Madeline Drury. 59-year-old Oleg Kononenko first blasted off into space in 2008
*27:20.780- 27:32.580* :  and did so again and again and again. Accumulating his world record across five different
*27:32.580- 27:37.480* :  missions, he's still up there after his current trip to the International Space Station launched
*27:37.480- 27:42.720* :  last year. I am proud of all my achievements. He said in a written interview with the Russian
*27:42.720- 27:48.260* :  news agency TAS, which we have voiced here. But I'm more proud that the record for the total
*27:48.260- 27:55.140* :  duration of human stay in space is still held by a Russian cosmonaut. At the end of this trip,
*27:55.300- 28:01.460* :  Kononenko is expected to bring his total to over a thousand days in space. It is only upon returning
*28:01.460- 28:07.800* :  home that the realization comes that for hundreds of days in my absence, the children have been
*28:07.800- 28:14.640* :  growing up without a papa. No one will return this time to me. But how about the record for longest
*28:14.640- 28:20.220* :  time spent in space in one go? That achievement is held by another Russian cosmonaut,
*28:20.220- 28:29.580* :  the Larry Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days in orbit between 1994 and 1995. Among U.S.
*28:29.580- 28:40.360* :  astronauts, the record is held by‚Ä¶ As captured on this livestream from NASA,
*28:40.840- 28:47.640* :  Rubio clocked up 371 continuous days in space, six months longer than he had intended on
*28:47.640- 28:54.300* :  spending up there, when his spacecraft got a leak. In 2022. The International Space Station is
*28:54.300- 28:59.580* :  one of the few projects that Russia and the United States work on together, a unique
*28:59.580- 29:05.180* :  awaycist since Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago. Russia's space programs are
*29:05.180- 29:10.320* :  currently grappling with funding shortages and corruption. Although President Vladimir Putin
*29:10.320- 29:15.620* :  has said he'll turn that around. Russia has blasted a man-made moon into outer space.
*29:16.020- 29:20.080* :  Kononenko's achievement is a world away from the early years of the space race,
*29:20.080- 29:25.120* :  when the Soviet Union became the first to launch a satellite to orbit the Earth with Sputnik
*29:25.540- 29:29.580* :  in 1957, captured in this archive from Periscope film.
*29:33.280- 29:35.100* :  That report was by Madeleine Tuary.
