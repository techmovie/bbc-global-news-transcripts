*01:07.520- 01:11.540* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:13.600- 01:20.800* :  I'm Nigel Adely and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday, February the 21st, these are our main stories.
*01:21.580- 01:27.880* :  Another test of the UK's nuclear missile programme fails. We examine who or what was to blame.
*01:28.660- 01:33.840* :  New research links some of the world's largest meatpacking companies to a legal deforestation
*01:33.840- 01:40.260* :  in Brazil and a coalition government is formed in Pakistan. We hear opinion from the streets of
*01:40.260- 01:48.480* :  Karachi. Also in this podcast, the widow of Haiti's murdered president defends herself
*01:48.480- 01:52.880* :  in allegations of involvement in her husband's death. We hear from her lawyer.
*01:53.520- 01:57.860* :  UNICEF warns that guards as children face a nightmare of malnutrition.
*02:05.700- 02:08.340* :  And the Premier League speaks out about online abuse.
*02:12.760- 02:17.320* :  The British Ministry of Defence has insisted that the UK's nuclear deterrent
*02:17.320- 02:23.560* :  remain safe and effective despite the second successive failure of a test firing of a missile
*02:23.560- 02:29.880* :  designed to carry warheads. The Ministry said an anomaly occurred during the test but did not give
*02:29.880- 02:35.640* :  further information. With the defence secretary and the head of the Navy on board to watch it launch,
*02:35.640- 02:42.820* :  it does, to say the least, look like an embarrassing failure. Jerome Stark is the defence editor of
*02:42.820- 02:47.780* :  the Sun newspaper and he got the scoop. He's been talking to Rebecca Kesby.
*03:13.320- 03:19.440* :  One of those submarines was conducting a test off the coast of Florida last month.
*03:19.480- 03:26.500* :  As part of that test, it was expected to fire an unarmed trident to D5 missile. The trident
*03:26.500- 03:33.420* :  missile blasted upwards out of the launch tube. These missiles are stored vertically in the
*03:33.420- 03:39.360* :  submarines. It blasted through the water and into the air propelled by a cloud of compressed gas.
*03:39.480- 03:46.220* :  And at that point, once it was airborne, its first stage rocket booster should have ignited.
*03:46.540- 03:51.920* :  But that failed. The first rocket booster failed and it crashed back into the ocean just yards
*03:51.920- 03:55.620* :  away from HMS Vanguard, the submarine that had launched it.
*03:56.120- 04:01.380* :  Yeah, I mean, the BBC's been speaking to the MOD at various points on this today and they are
*04:01.380- 04:07.920* :  telling us those sources that this wouldn't happen in a real-world launch. I guess that would mean
*04:07.920- 04:14.640* :  during some sort of military activity and with a warhead on board, the trouble is, though, Jerome.
*04:14.640- 04:20.480* :  This did happen again in 2016, didn't it? On another failed test.
*04:20.920- 04:27.580* :  Well, you're right. I mean, there's no escaping the facts, which have been two unsuccessful test
*04:27.580- 04:33.440* :  launches of the trident to missile from Royal Navy submarines. Now, the circumstances are
*04:33.440- 04:38.760* :  slightly different. In 2016, the missile came out of the submarine. Its boosters did ignite,
*04:38.760- 04:44.300* :  but in that occasion, it veered off course and it automatically self-destructed.
*04:44.360- 04:50.000* :  Taken together, that means that the last successful testfire of a trident to missile was more than
*04:50.000- 04:55.320* :  11 years ago because they cost about 17 million pounds each.
*04:55.860- 05:02.560* :  Jerome, you mentioned how expensive it is to run these tests, multiple millions of dollars,
*05:02.880- 05:09.520* :  and the UK is spending, I think it's around 40 billion pounds. That's probably what, 70 billion
*05:09.520- 05:15.660* :  dollars or so, in upgrading its nuclear deterrent at the moment. This is at a time when the UK
*05:15.660- 05:23.140* :  is a bit cash-strapped. The UK is one of only two nuclear powers in Europe together with France,
*05:23.260- 05:31.420* :  but this costs us around 3 billion pounds a year. That's our 6% of the defence budget, so it is
*05:31.420- 05:39.000* :  expensive, but when MPs were asked to vote in 2017 as to whether or not we should renew the deterrent
*05:39.000- 05:43.660* :  and replace these vanguard-class submarines with a new generation of dreadnought submarines,
*05:43.720- 05:49.140* :  that got overwhelming supports. Ultimately, it probably won't come as a surprise to many of your
*05:49.140- 05:54.740* :  listeners that the world feels like a more dangerous place at the moment. That is why the UK
*05:54.740- 06:01.920* :  keeps a nuclear deterrent. Jerome Starkey of the Sun newspaper. Almost two weeks after the national
*06:01.920- 06:08.520* :  elections in Pakistan produced no clear winner, two political parties, the Pakistan Muslim League
*06:08.520- 06:14.500* :  and the Pakistan People's Party have reached a formal agreement on a new coalition government.
*06:15.120- 06:21.780* :  It is likely to see Shibar Sharif become Prime Minister for a second time. Supporters of Pakistan's
*06:21.780- 06:27.400* :  former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was currently in prison, say the election was stolen because
*06:27.400- 06:33.700* :  they won the most seats, although not enough to get a majority. Ryof Hassan is the spokesman
*06:33.700- 06:40.080* :  for Imran Khan's PTI party. It's a coalition among decoits and teems, basically. Now this
*06:40.080- 06:44.960* :  coalition of the corrupt has been imposed in Pakistan yet again, not through a democratic process,
*06:44.960- 06:51.540* :  but by midnight operation where they ran away with about 82 of our seats, extending an artificial
*06:51.540- 06:56.100* :  majority in the parliament to this coalition. We have three options, basically. We have been
*06:56.100- 07:01.520* :  elected to the parliament in spite of the opposition from the powers. So we definitely want to play
*07:01.520- 07:06.080* :  a constitutional role sitting within the assemblies, both at the centre and in the provinces.
*07:06.840- 07:11.640* :  Two, we have legal decoits and we shall be taking our cases to the courts, wherever applicable.
*07:12.100- 07:16.760* :  And the third option that we have is as a political party, the Constitution of the country gives us
*07:16.760- 07:21.180* :  a right for peace and protest. And we definitely intend to use that also as an amendment needed.
*07:21.640- 07:24.060* :  This was the reaction of some people in Karachi.
*07:27.320- 07:31.380* :  It seems like a joke. These politicians have been ruling this country for the last 40 years.
*07:31.500- 07:36.040* :  They're being imposed on us once again. I don't think this government will last long.
*07:36.060- 07:41.480* :  Today, the economy of the country is in a shambles. Last time they're in power, what did they do for
*07:41.480- 07:50.120* :  the country? It's impossible for people to get any relief because there are all the same
*07:50.120- 07:56.340* :  politicians. They mudsling each other during the elections, then they enter into power again with
*07:56.340- 08:02.280* :  each other. So I don't think people will get any relief. Our South Asia regional editor is
*08:02.280- 08:08.420* :  Ambarasan et Arasim. Support us of Mr Imran Khan was currently in jail. They will question the
*08:08.420- 08:13.700* :  legitimacy of the government because what they say is that we won the highest number of seats,
*08:13.700- 08:20.160* :  even though we did not get majority. And they also allege a massive state orchestrated election
*08:20.160- 08:24.140* :  fraud. They said they won two-thirds of the seats, though the government and the Election Commission
*08:24.140- 08:29.860* :  rejected this agreement. The second thing is what we see is the act two of what happened
*08:30.700- 08:34.760* :  before the election. That was a coalition between these two major political parties,
*08:34.760- 08:39.820* :  Pakistan Muslim League and the Pakistan People's Party. That government was hugely
*08:39.820- 08:45.600* :  unpopular because they had to increase electricity and gas tariffs, price acts were common.
*08:45.600- 08:51.260* :  They had to go to the IMF for an emergency loan. Now the same two political parties, which came
*08:51.260- 08:56.280* :  number two and number three, they are forming a coalition. So Mr Khan's supporters will continue
*08:56.280- 09:02.280* :  to ask the legitimacy of this government because they say they have been rejected by the people.
*09:02.740- 09:07.040* :  And how stable is Pakistan now because there are some huge issues facing the country?
*09:07.320- 09:12.600* :  Pakistan needs stability at this moment, both for economy and for political situation because
*09:12.600- 09:18.080* :  the country is facing an inflation rate of about 28 percent. Cost of living crisis is heating
*09:18.080- 09:24.240* :  the people hard and you have seen a number of electricity prices hike. So that is hitting people,
*09:24.240- 09:29.940* :  a common man on the ground. So they need a stable government to revive the economy. And again,
*09:30.380- 09:34.960* :  the militants attacks in the northwest have been increasing and they've been accusing the
*09:34.960- 09:40.040* :  Pakistani Taliban of carrying these attacks, even though militaries in the background trying
*09:40.040- 09:45.540* :  to form a coalition government here. Now what they want to see is a government which can engage with
*09:45.540- 09:50.180* :  the other political leaders, other governments in the world, to bring economic growth as well as
*09:50.180- 09:56.480* :  to provide security. I'm Barrison Eterongen. The US has vetoed the latest attempt at the United
*09:56.480- 10:02.880* :  Nations to demand an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. The latest diplomatic stalemate comes as the
*10:02.880- 10:10.060* :  UN's children's agency UNICEF warns of a potentially deadly rise in malnutrition among children
*10:10.060- 10:16.080* :  in the enclave, where its estimated nearly two million Palestinians have been internally displaced.
*10:16.760- 10:21.360* :  That's had a significant impact on health. This woman was in Raffa.
*10:24.140- 10:30.000* :  I live in the European area. All the time I hear the sound of missiles, strikes and aircraft
*10:30.060- 10:36.500* :  flying over our heads. There is no safe place for us. They say that we must take our belongings in
*10:36.500- 10:42.940* :  Heto Al-Mawasi. We have been displaced twice already. There is a scarcity of water and the
*10:42.940- 10:49.320* :  rain is pouring over us. Our condition is very miserable. I wonder what kind of sin we committed
*10:49.320- 10:55.940* :  to be humiliated in this way. They target Al-Mujahideen, all the resistant fighters, but where are
*10:55.940- 11:02.140* :  those fighters? What did our children do to be subjected to all this tragedy? Whoever was
*11:02.140- 11:08.440* :  displaced to Raffa has returned again to Haneunis. The existence of a safe area in Gaza is
*11:08.440- 11:16.480* :  nothing but a lie. Salim Owais is the communication officer for UNICEF's Middle East and North African
*11:16.480- 11:22.700* :  Regional Office in Iran. What we're seeing is a real rise in malnutrition in the Gaza Strip,
*11:22.800- 11:29.700* :  in the north, especially, which now has won in six children under two years suffering from acute
*11:29.740- 11:36.740* :  malnutrition. That's 15.6% of the population there. This is a really huge increase in numbers,
*11:36.740- 11:42.240* :  and to be honest, it's unprecedented globally. The increase within this time frame, we're talking
*11:42.240- 11:48.560* :  about four months. What we're seeing now is even in the south, which is receiving some aid,
*11:48.560- 11:55.960* :  we have 5% of the children are acute humanitarian. It's really imperative now to get the aid into
*11:55.960- 12:01.980* :  Gaza across the district, not only to the south. When we're talking about malnutrition, it's more than
*12:01.980- 12:06.660* :  just not having the food and being hungry. If this continues, we're risking their lives, that's
*12:06.660- 12:11.000* :  one that's the most important part, but also risking the future. If this continues and they don't
*12:11.000- 12:16.220* :  get the services that they need, the treatment that they need, their bodies will be weak and their
*12:16.220- 12:22.840* :  immune system will be weak, and we are already seeing a spread of diseases. 90% of the children that
*12:22.840- 12:29.440* :  we interviewed had at least one communicable disease already, so with a compromised immune system
*12:29.440- 12:34.180* :  because of the malnutrition, we're going to see a rise of these diseases and consequently
*12:34.180- 12:43.080* :  a threat to their lives. As we record this edition of the Global News Podcast, a pioneering
*12:43.080- 12:49.860* :  European satellite is due to plunge into the Earth's atmosphere. The ERS-2 was a cutting-edge
*12:49.860- 12:55.120* :  observation platform that helped forwards technologies that had now routinely been used to study
*12:55.120- 13:00.660* :  the planet. Monitoring floods, the movement of ground during earthquakes and tracing the flow
*13:00.660- 13:10.580* :  of ice fields. This was the launch 29 years ago. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, double.
*13:18.140- 13:23.040* :  A European Space Agency says most of the satellite will burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.
*13:23.740- 13:27.720* :  Earlier, I spoke to the BBC Science correspondent Jonathan Amos.
*13:28.280- 13:34.940* :  It was really the technology in Europe that gave birth to what we now recognise as Earth observation.
*13:35.840- 13:39.560* :  You know, quite often, science reporters like me come on and we talk about what's happening
*13:39.560- 13:44.280* :  on planet Earth, and that's done by satellites moving overhead, taking pictures,
*13:44.880- 13:50.280* :  taking soundings of the atmosphere, looking at how the ice moves, how the Earth buckles in earthquakes,
*13:51.360- 14:00.300* :  and the idea of how to do that was really born on this type of satellite, Earth Remote Sensing
*14:00.640- 14:06.780* :  satellite. The European Space Agency launched two back in the 90s and it kind of all stems from these
*14:06.780- 14:13.240* :  and one of them is still up there, ERS-1. It's quite high up. ERS-2 is the one that's going to come
*14:13.240- 14:20.080* :  back today and we're expecting it to fall into the atmosphere around about 430 GMT, although there
*14:20.080- 14:25.040* :  is some uncertainty about that because it all depends on how it interacts with the atmosphere as it
*14:25.700- 14:32.160* :  scopes along the top of the air that surrounds the planet. And in your piece on the BBC website,
*14:32.160- 14:37.660* :  you say most of the satellite will burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, but the more robust parts
*14:37.660- 14:43.620* :  may make it to worth, but you say the chances of hitting built-up areas are slim, but of course slim
*14:43.620- 14:48.960* :  is not zero. Yeah, you've got to remember that 71% of the planet is covered by oceans.
*14:49.100- 14:54.280* :  If you're going to lay a bet, you would say it's going to end up swimming any parts.
*14:54.280- 14:59.580* :  Yeah, I mean, it'll come screaming in, you know, several kilometres per second. That velocity
*14:59.580- 15:04.620* :  is, it hits the atmosphere, but 80 kilometres up. It's going to start melting. Metal parts will
*15:04.620- 15:09.860* :  start melting. Everything will start burning. There are one or two bits and pieces that are
*15:09.860- 15:15.460* :  likely to make it through all the way to the surface. There's some carbon fiber bits and pieces
*15:16.000- 15:23.400* :  like on the radar antenna that might make it through some metal casings on tanks, pressure tanks,
*15:23.400- 15:29.880* :  fuel tanks, but the chances of it, you know, those things hitting, you know, the middle of a town
*15:29.880- 15:37.420* :  or a city, famous last words are very slim indeed. You know, we do expect most of these things
*15:37.940- 15:44.960* :  to end up going into the water. Jonathan Amos. England's Premier League has set up a dedicated
*15:44.960- 15:50.740* :  team to hunt down online trolls who've been targeting football players and their families.
*15:51.520- 15:56.300* :  The league say it's taken the action to help stem the rise in tide of social media threats.
*15:57.140- 16:03.120* :  The BBC's disinformation and social media correspondent Mariana Spring has been given
*16:03.120- 16:08.520* :  exclusive access to the team and told me more about its work. Whenever you're watching a game
*16:08.520- 16:14.140* :  and someone gets sent off or maybe they score a penalty or miss a penalty or they score a last
*16:14.140- 16:18.560* :  minute winner, you know that they are likely to be subject to some kind of abuse or hate online
*16:18.560- 16:23.220* :  and you know that can be worse if they also experience racist hate or other forms of abuse.
*16:23.820- 16:28.680* :  So I think it's something that has almost become part and parcel of being a footballer and being
*16:28.680- 16:33.460* :  in public life more generally, but where it gets really scary is threats where people are worried
*16:33.460- 16:37.420* :  that someone might actually turn up at their house or come and find them. And you've been speaking
*16:37.420- 16:42.660* :  to a player in particular who has a fairly shocking story to tell. Neil Mopey who's a striker right now
*16:42.660- 16:48.420* :  for Brentford but at the time when he was playing for Brighton another club they played Arsenal
*16:48.420- 16:55.280* :  in this game during the COVID-19 pandemic and he injured unintentionally Arsenal's goalkeeper.
*16:55.280- 16:59.580* :  He also scored a last minute winner and when he came off the pitch he obviously received lots of
*16:59.580- 17:03.840* :  congratulations from friends and family but soon it became a lot more sinister and he realised
*17:03.840- 17:08.460* :  he was being subject to a very high volume of online abuse and there were some particularly
*17:08.460- 17:12.660* :  threatening messages that caused concern to him basically suggesting that the person was going
*17:12.660- 17:17.540* :  to come and attack his family or come to his home so he decided that he wanted to do something
*17:17.540- 17:21.480* :  about it and this was his reaction to receiving those kinds of messages.
*17:21.800- 17:26.540* :  It was very disturbing you know because I received one saying basically I know where you live
*17:26.540- 17:31.760* :  I will come to your house tonight and I'm going to kill you and your family. I called the club
*17:31.760- 17:37.300* :  and said listen we need to do something because what if that guy is really coming back to my house.
*17:37.760- 17:43.260* :  And what can the Premier League actually do here? So Neil Moepe referred through his club
*17:43.260- 17:47.840* :  referred these messages into this new troll busting unit that exists in the Premier League. It was
*17:47.840- 17:53.780* :  set up back in 2019 and it uses basically the same techniques that they use to find people who are
*17:53.780- 17:59.080* :  illegally sharing streams of matches to track down players' abusers and find out who's sending
*17:59.080- 18:04.500* :  that hate. They have two options one is that they can report and flag the most abusive content
*18:04.500- 18:08.520* :  that could be in breach of social media companies guidelines who then might take it down
*18:09.160- 18:14.240* :  or and they are able to compile a dossier of evidence about the person who might be behind
*18:14.240- 18:18.000* :  that account and share it with the relevant authorities. There are a couple of things that really
*18:18.000- 18:22.200* :  struck me during the conversation I had with Tim Cooper who is the head of this troll busting team.
*18:22.380- 18:27.780* :  The first was that a huge volume of this abuse is coming from overseas. They say 80% of it comes
*18:27.780- 18:31.740* :  not from within the UK but from places all over the world and that was certainly the case with
*18:31.740- 18:37.040* :  Neil Moepe's troll who turned out to be a 19-year-old based in Singapore called Derek Ungde Ren.
*18:37.040- 18:41.640* :  They shared the relevant evidence with the authorities in Singapore and he was later prosecuted
*18:42.220- 18:47.360* :  for sending those messages and received a nine months. But the other thing that I've found really
*18:47.360- 18:52.160* :  striking is just the way that anyone connected to players becomes fair game and one of the things
*18:52.160- 18:57.200* :  Tim told me about was how friends and family in particular are seeing a real rise in the kind of
*18:57.200- 19:01.620* :  hate that they experience. We see family mobs getting as much abuse as the players do
*19:02.040- 19:05.460* :  and they can report us to then investigate the direct messages that have been sent to them.
*19:05.680- 19:10.320* :  Certainly sometimes that is the more abuse is sent to them than the players themselves.
*19:10.980- 19:15.440* :  I think what this tells us beyond football and this is about a lot more than football because a
*19:15.440- 19:20.960* :  lot of people experience online abuse in different ways is that while there perhaps is benefit
*19:20.960- 19:25.920* :  in holding trolls to account for their behaviour there are a lot of people that have to be held to
*19:25.920- 19:29.420* :  account for what's going on whether that's the social media companies or authorities
*19:29.860- 19:33.740* :  and I guess society in general the approach we take you know how do we stop this behaviour
*19:33.740- 19:38.520* :  even happening in the first place. So for me one of the important things I think
*19:38.520- 19:42.780* :  aside from all of the accountability is just to be able to talk about it and to speak up and I
*19:42.780- 19:46.980* :  think certainly Neil Moe pay speaking to me hopes that by talking about his experience
*19:46.980- 19:49.780* :  of online abuse it might encourage other people to speak up about theirs.
*19:50.260- 19:56.060* :  Marianna spring and there's more on this story on her podcast why do you hate me which is
*19:56.060- 20:04.640* :  available on BBC Sounds. Still to come we believe that Coutie's regime will continue with
*20:04.640- 20:09.300* :  disruptions and new tricks they'll take actions against the normal life of Serbs because they
*20:09.300- 20:14.620* :  think the only way to win is if there are no more Serbs in Kosovo. Kosovo Serbs fear for their
*20:14.620- 20:26.600* :  future as the DNR is banned. When you see Iran close up you realise just how complex
*20:26.600- 20:33.600* :  a political landscape it is. The global story smart takes and fresh perspectives on one big
*20:33.600- 20:38.840* :  new story. It seems that Iran's strategy at the moment is to increase the tension in the
*20:38.860- 20:44.380* :  Middle East every Monday to Friday from the BBC World Service. When Israel does agree to the cease
*20:44.380- 20:49.880* :  fire in Gaza Iran will then worry about Israel then turning its sights towards Iran again.
*20:50.040- 20:53.680* :  The global story find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*20:57.900- 21:03.660* :  Three major beef production companies in Brazil have been accused of links to deforestation.
*21:03.740- 21:09.160* :  The environmental rights charity Global Witness says it has found that JBS,
*21:09.160- 21:14.960* :  Minerva and Maafrik are sourcing cattle from land that's been illegally cleared on the
*21:14.960- 21:20.640* :  Sahada, Savannah. Simon Roach from Global Witness explained the importance of the research.
*21:21.260- 21:25.260* :  The investigation is important firstly because while we already knew that deforestation
*21:25.300- 21:30.160* :  in the Sahada has been rising it reveals what and who has partly been driving it and that's
*21:30.160- 21:34.340* :  crucial for accountability if the world wants to actually protect these vital ecosystems.
*21:34.380- 21:40.480* :  Daniel Gallus is the BBC Brazil reporter. Everyone who looks at the map of Brazil sees a huge chunk
*21:40.480- 21:45.240* :  of land, green chunk of land on top on the north and that's the Amazon and right under it.
*21:45.520- 21:49.640* :  There's another huge chunk of land which in map satellites usually is not as green,
*21:49.640- 21:55.880* :  that's the Sahada, it's a Savannah. Very mixture of forest and desert, very bushing, very dry.
*21:56.460- 22:01.520* :  Up until the 1970s there wasn't a lot of settlement there and there wasn't even a lot of forest
*22:01.520- 22:08.440* :  there but since then scientists discovered how to actually race crops there and it has become a huge
*22:08.440- 22:15.480* :  source of crops for Brazil and it's one of the it's one of the engines of Brazil's growth in
*22:15.480- 22:21.360* :  economic growth in the past two decades at least. And what are the companies had to say in response
*22:21.360- 22:28.300* :  to global witnesses allegations? Well the three companies denied that they're doing any extra
*22:28.300- 22:34.640* :  illegal deforestation and one of the companies said that it actually abandoned some of the farms
*22:34.640- 22:40.980* :  that are being accused because these are farms that they source products from so that's their side
*22:40.980- 22:47.120* :  from from from the story. And the area stores billions of tons of carbon dioxide and what impact
*22:47.120- 22:53.460* :  is deforestation have on the Cerrado's ability to store that? Yes well people talk a lot about the
*22:53.460- 23:02.820* :  Amazon which is the world's greatest carbon storage place in the world but the Sahada is not too
*23:02.820- 23:10.160* :  far behind it holds 13.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide which is kind of about what China released
*23:10.160- 23:16.220* :  in carbon dioxide last year. The Sahada tends to get very overlooked internationally just because
*23:16.220- 23:21.220* :  there's so much attention to the Amazon not just internationally but in Brazil as well people
*23:21.220- 23:27.200* :  talk a lot about the importance of preserving the Amazon but there isn't much talk about the Sahada
*23:27.200- 23:32.720* :  despite it being a beautiful land with you know a lot of our ideas of plants and animals. And just
*23:32.720- 23:38.460* :  finally and briefly there have been some hopes that President Lula would actually cut the amount
*23:38.460- 23:43.880* :  of deforestation in the Amazon region is that happening? Well that is happening drastically in
*23:43.880- 23:49.920* :  the Amazon region cut by half in the first year of his administration and it has been a win for
*23:49.920- 23:55.000* :  his government a lot of people say but the problem is places like the Sahada deforestation went up
*23:55.000- 24:01.380* :  by 43%. So that's due to a lots of problems that the government has intactly deforestation in
*24:01.380- 24:06.920* :  that place. It's in a way it's been easier to tackle deforestation in the Amazon that it has been
*24:06.920- 24:13.580* :  in the Sahada. Daniel Gallus more than 50 people have been indicted over their alleged involvement
*24:13.580- 24:20.840* :  in the killing of Haiti's president Jovenel Moish in 2021. One name really stands out.
*24:20.840- 24:27.280* :  The late president's wife and former first lady Martin Moish. She was among those injured when
*24:27.280- 24:32.460* :  our men stormed the presidential palace and shot at her husband. The indictments have been
*24:32.460- 24:37.700* :  brought by a Haitian judge and are different to a separate trial that is underway in Miami
*24:38.380- 24:43.420* :  where half a dozen Colombian mercenaries have already admitted their involvement in the assassination
*24:43.580- 24:50.480* :  James Coppnell has been speaking to Marty Moish's lawyer Paul Turner. In this case there was
*24:51.180- 24:56.580* :  you know a heinous crime which was the assassination of the president but in that assassination
*24:57.640- 25:03.320* :  Mrs. Moish was also shot multiple times and it's the saying significant injuries that she had
*25:03.320- 25:09.800* :  have been evacuated to the U.S. to U.S. hospitals and she has permanent physical damage even
*25:09.800- 25:16.400* :  to this day from from that crime. Also her family her kids were there right and so their kids had
*25:16.400- 25:23.100* :  to avoid you know they're you know bodily harm themselves. So the real issue here is we were hoping
*25:23.100- 25:27.960* :  to get through the criminal trial that the U.S. government is bringing in May of this year
*25:28.580- 25:33.800* :  against the remaining defendants that they have incarcerated here. Six of them have already
*25:33.800- 25:39.840* :  pled guilty and in pleading guilty you know what they didn't say that Moish had anything to do with
*25:39.840- 25:46.040* :  assassination of her husband or the shooting of herself. So we are at a total loss as to why
*25:46.040- 25:52.740* :  or what grounds they're relying on to assert that she had any role in the shooting of herself
*25:53.580- 25:57.880* :  the life-threatening actions against her children and obviously the assassination of the
*25:57.880- 26:02.840* :  president her husband. Now the only thing we can think of is that they're taking a page from the
*26:02.840- 26:08.460* :  dictator's handbook right grab power hold power don't relinquish power and you can just look
*26:08.460- 26:12.700* :  and see Putin did that and he's obviously did it successfully his his political opponent was
*26:13.460- 26:20.400* :  you know brought to Kangaroo Court went to president just parish just died and so I think that
*26:20.400- 26:27.980* :  there's a fear in the Haitian political group at this time that she might run for president.
*26:28.560- 26:34.600* :  Your client and Marty Moish is a political threat that's the only thing that makes sense why would
*26:34.600- 26:41.980* :  they want to indict her and threaten to put her on trial and incarcerate her when she's a victim
*26:41.980- 26:47.760* :  is classic victim blaming Paul Turner. Kosovo is facing calls from its international partners
*26:48.380- 26:54.440* :  to suspend the implementation of a ban on the use of the Serbian currency the regulation banning
*26:54.440- 27:00.800* :  the Dina is the latest in a series of moves by Kosovo's government to assert its authority over
*27:00.800- 27:07.760* :  majority Serb areas and a relatively muted reaction from Serbia has left Kosovo Serbs
*27:08.080- 27:14.000* :  wandering whether they still have Belgrade's backing as our Balkans correspondent Guadalone reports.
*27:16.880- 27:21.560* :  With drawing money from a cash machine as a process that most of us take for granted but not
*27:21.560- 27:29.220* :  Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority that's because Kosovo's central bank has recently banned transactions
*27:29.220- 27:36.000* :  in any currency other than the euro and Serbs mostly use the Serbian Dina Serbius president
*27:36.000- 27:40.820* :  Alexander Vucic accuses Kosovo's prime minister Albin Kuddi of systematically
*27:40.820- 27:47.740* :  persecuting Kosovo's Serb minority. The goal is the ethnic cleansing of the Serbian population
*27:47.820- 27:53.540* :  from the territory of Kosovo and Metaheer deliberately subjecting Serbs to unbearable living conditions.
*27:53.540- 27:58.240* :  We believe that Kuddi's regime will continue with disruptions and new tricks. They'll take
*27:58.240- 28:03.380* :  actions against the normal life of Serbs because they think the only way to win is if there are no more
*28:03.380- 28:09.320* :  Serbs in Kosovo. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Serbs remain. North
*28:09.320- 28:15.100* :  Metrovica is the largest majority Serb town in Kosovo thousands of people here work in Serbian
*28:15.100- 28:20.700* :  institutions including schools and hospitals. They were given only two weeks to adapt to Kosovo's
*28:20.700- 28:26.340* :  new currency regulations but Prime Minister Albin Kuddi insists that isn't actually a ban on the
*28:26.340- 28:31.520* :  Dina he says the regulations are designed to keep Kosovo citizens safe from fraud. We are not
*28:31.520- 28:39.540* :  banning Dinaar Serbian Dinaar people can have Serbian Dinaars but the only mean of payment is euro.
*28:39.540- 28:47.520* :  The forced installation of ethnic Albanian mayors and majority Serb areas triggered violent
*28:47.520- 28:53.060* :  scenes last May. Kosovo's authorities have also removed Serbian insignia from public buildings
*28:53.060- 28:59.140* :  and forced Serbs to surrender their Serbian-issued vehicle license plates. These are all issues which
*28:59.140- 29:04.160* :  cut to the heart of Kosovo's Serb identity but they passed with relatively little complaint
*29:04.160- 29:09.200* :  from Serbius capital Belgrade and that's left Kosovo Serbs feeling insecure.
*29:09.200- 29:15.320* :  People really are losing hope. Yovanna Radasavliyevich is from North Metrovica and runs the
*29:15.320- 29:20.640* :  new social initiative, an organization that tries to build trust between Kosovo Serbs and the
*29:20.640- 29:26.740* :  Albanian majority. It is disappointing to see no stronger messages coming in from Belgrade,
*29:26.740- 29:33.040* :  no strong messages from the local leaders as well so we're basically left completely
*29:33.600- 29:41.280* :  in this leadership vacuum. Kosovo Serbs feel stuck between the authorities and
*29:41.280- 29:45.960* :  Pristina making their lives more difficult and those in Belgrade who support appears to be
*29:45.960- 29:50.260* :  waning. The latest figures suggest that one in ten of them have left in the past year
*29:50.260- 29:57.320* :  if they can't get paid more may join that exodus. Guadalorne, the Biden administration has
*29:57.320- 30:03.080* :  strongly criticized an Alabama Supreme Court for ruling that frozen embryos are legally
*30:03.080- 30:08.380* :  children. The White House press secretary said last week's decision would have devastating
*30:08.380- 30:14.440* :  consequences, undermining women's access to reproductive care and to contraception.
*30:15.000- 30:21.480* :  The top US infertility association resolve, call the decision, a terrifying development for those
*30:21.480- 30:27.000* :  who need IVF to have a child. Speaking to reporters the Republican governor of Alabama,
*30:27.540- 30:30.060* :  Kay Evey defended the court's involvement.
*30:30.320- 30:36.660* :  As I've said many times we foster the culture of life and protect the sanctity of life
*30:37.780- 30:44.480* :  and we also respect the work of our courts and though I hadn't read a hundred
*30:44.480- 30:51.000* :  fifty pages of their ruling we respect their work and I'm sure there'll be more discussions
*30:51.000- 30:54.660* :  on this topic and I'll follow that issue very closely.
*30:55.100- 30:57.280* :  Kay Evey, the governor of Alabama.
*30:58.540- 31:05.580* :  Simardelli Adiagbo is an undoubted trailblazer. In 2018 she became the first Nigerian
*31:05.580- 31:10.840* :  to compete at the Winter Olympics and also became the first black female Olympian
*31:10.840- 31:16.780* :  in the sport of skeleton. This week she's competing at the Bob Slay World Championships in
*31:16.780- 31:22.680* :  Vinterburg in Germany. On the same track two years ago she became the first African to win a
*31:22.680- 31:28.640* :  World Cup race when she claimed the Monobob title and she's looking forward to her latest run.
*31:37.440- 31:43.580* :  I feel a great privilege first of all for the opportunity to take this huge step forward for
*31:43.580- 31:49.360* :  not only Nigeria but for the continent of Africa. You know the IBSF the International Bob Slay
*31:49.360- 31:56.480* :  skeleton federation has just celebrated a hundred years of existence and in that century there has
*31:56.480- 32:02.960* :  been no African athlete in Bob Slay that is competed at the World Championships so it took a whole
*32:02.960- 32:09.300* :  century to break this barrier and so for me I feel very privileged and honored to be the one that
*32:09.600- 32:15.020* :  that has this opportunity to do this on the world stage and I'm very proud to be representing Nigeria
*32:15.020- 32:21.960* :  and the continent of Africa. So I really just want to just show up for the country and the
*32:21.960- 32:28.100* :  continent to really show that not only am I breaking this barrier and making this history but really
*32:28.100- 32:34.480* :  just compete with the rest of the world. So I'm bad for me it would be success. I've had to just
*32:35.220- 32:40.500* :  overcome so many barriers just to get here but I'm here and now it's just time to show the world
*32:40.500- 32:42.180* :  what what Nigerians can do.
*32:45.820- 32:54.140* :  While the landscape continues to grow I think in small ways I think the bar has been set in terms of
*32:54.940- 33:00.480* :  different examples that we can pull from to show that it's possible not only myself but my teammates
*33:00.480- 33:07.560* :  that I made history with back in 2018 in 2022 Nigeria had representation at the Beijing Olympics
*33:07.560- 33:13.380* :  with a ski athlete and even when you look at the uth Olympics that just took place a few weeks
*33:13.380- 33:20.000* :  ago in Pyeongchang there was a Nigerian curling team so we are seeing some small steps forward but
*33:20.580- 33:26.540* :  I'm hopeful that the investment will be made for it on the continent of Africa. I think it's going
*33:26.540- 33:33.140* :  to take a very intentional plan and a strategic plan for it to be sustainable going forward.
*33:33.420- 33:42.660* :  That was Simardelli Adiagbo who's competing for Nigeria at this week's Will Bob Slade Championships.
*33:45.800- 33:50.440* :  And that's all for us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
