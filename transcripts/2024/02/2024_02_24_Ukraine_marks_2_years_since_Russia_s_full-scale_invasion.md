*00:00.460- 00:04.100* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.100- 00:10.960* :  I'm Nick Karaci and in the early hours of Sunday the 25th of February, these are our main stories.
*00:11.800- 00:16.780* :  Two years since Russia's full-scale invasion, a rallying cry from Ukraine's president.
*00:16.780- 00:21.880* :  None of us will allow our Ukraine to end.
*00:22.820- 00:28.440* :  In the future, next to the word Ukraine, the word independent will always stand.
*00:29.300- 00:34.440* :  Alexey Navalny's body is handed to his mother after a battle with Russian authorities.
*00:35.280- 00:40.360* :  And the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees halts aid deliveries to Northern Gaza,
*00:40.800- 00:44.260* :  claiming those starving are trying to take aid from passing trucks.
*00:46.800- 00:51.940* :  Also in this podcast, a politician in Britain's governing conservative party is suspended
*00:52.540- 00:55.340* :  for anti-Muslim comments against the mayor of London.
*00:55.820- 00:58.880* :  What you're doing there, you shouldn't be doing it.
*00:59.340- 01:01.720* :  You know, having a crack off the track is what you need to believe.
*01:01.720- 01:05.280* :  It is a problem for a lot of refugees, but you're doing it there.
*01:06.500- 01:12.580* :  No to mansplaining how teaching golf to a female professional has caught the attention of millions.
*01:18.760- 01:22.800* :  President Zelensky has issued a rallying cry to the people of Ukraine
*01:22.800- 01:26.580* :  on the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
*01:27.100- 01:31.360* :  He said Ukrainians would win the war, but stressed it must end on our terms
*01:31.360- 01:33.900* :  and with what he called a just piece.
*01:34.460- 01:37.100* :  A number of Western leaders, including the head of the European Commission,
*01:37.100- 01:40.760* :  Ursula von der Leyen, traveled to Kiev to show solidarity.
*01:40.760- 01:43.840* :  Our correspondent there, James Waterhouse, sent this.
*01:44.520- 01:47.740* :  It's been two years of change and upheaval for Ukraine.
*01:47.740- 01:50.940* :  And this is a very different war from 2022.
*01:51.780- 01:54.720* :  As both sides continue to mobilize thousands of men,
*01:54.720- 01:57.520* :  it is the invaders making their size count
*01:57.520- 02:00.620* :  by advancing in several areas of the front line.
*02:01.340- 02:05.640* :  Unlike Moscow, Kiev can't keep its economy on a total war footing
*02:06.100- 02:08.920* :  and is, as ever, reliant on Western help.
*02:09.640- 02:13.300* :  A number of Western leaders came to Kiev today to show their support.
*02:14.000- 02:18.680* :  They visited the Hostile Air Base where Russian paratroopers first tried to land two years ago.
*02:19.420- 02:21.820* :  President Zelensky praised the people of Ukraine.
*02:26.180- 02:28.460* :  I am incredibly proud of each of you.
*02:28.620- 02:30.320* :  I admire each of you.
*02:30.500- 02:32.180* :  I believe in each of you.
*02:32.660- 02:34.720* :  Any normal person wants the war to end,
*02:34.720- 02:37.840* :  but none of us will allow our Ukraine to end.
*02:38.160- 02:41.140* :  Italy's Prime Minister, George Maloney, also spoke.
*02:41.380- 02:45.080* :  Here we are today to say thanks to those men and women
*02:45.080- 02:48.040* :  who on the 24th of February two years ago
*02:48.480- 02:52.000* :  did not run away and instead fought for themselves,
*02:52.000- 02:55.600* :  for the families, for what they hold most dear.
*02:56.200- 02:59.700* :  This place is the symbol of Moscow failure.
*03:00.060- 03:01.920* :  But there was an important mission.
*03:02.660- 03:04.840* :  Unlike last year, neither President Biden
*03:05.200- 03:08.000* :  nor anyone from the White House visited Ukraine's capital
*03:08.000- 03:09.380* :  for this year's anniversary.
*03:10.220- 03:15.080* :  What is more concerning for Kiev is the sizeable $60 billion military package
*03:15.560- 03:16.780* :  still blocked in Washington.
*03:17.820- 03:20.060* :  Today was a significant serve commitment
*03:20.520- 03:22.320* :  and unity from Ukraine's allies.
*03:23.460- 03:26.160* :  But the worry for Ukraine is whether this will be matched
*03:26.220- 03:28.800* :  by the U.S. beyond its upcoming election.
*03:29.540- 03:30.480* :  James Waterhouse there.
*03:30.640- 03:35.260* :  Well, as the Biden administration struggles to get that multi-billion-dollar aid package
*03:35.260- 03:36.340* :  approved in Washington,
*03:36.780- 03:40.420* :  Estonia's Prime Minister has urged leaders to bolster support for Ukraine.
*03:40.420- 03:46.060* :  In a striking warning, Kaya Callas said the war could spread very fast in Europe
*03:46.060- 03:49.740* :  and called on Ukraine's allies to do their utmost to help.
*03:50.180- 03:52.360* :  Our chief international correspondent at least is set,
*03:52.360- 03:53.940* :  asked Oleg Daninoff,
*03:54.260- 03:57.400* :  the Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council,
*03:57.880- 04:01.080* :  if he was worried that they won't get the money from the United States.
*04:01.680- 04:04.400* :  She said that there is a question
*04:04.400- 04:05.540* :  over whether everything will be done on time.
*04:05.540- 04:10.220* :  If you don't do something on time, then keep it up.
*04:10.760- 04:12.380* :  That it will cost you a lot later.
*04:13.640- 04:17.480* :  European countries, they're worried about the possibility that President Trump could return to office.
*04:17.480- 04:21.140* :  President Trump, who is known to have an affinity with President Putin,
*04:21.220- 04:23.220* :  has said he would end the Ukraine war in days.
*04:23.580- 04:25.500* :  Are you also worried about this possibility?
*04:27.780- 04:28.140* :  That's just a suicide.
*04:28.140- 04:29.500* :  Concerning the election of the President of the United States,
*04:30.500- 04:33.540* :  this is the business of the Americans.
*04:33.540- 04:35.520* :  They have the right to do so.
*04:37.240- 04:39.000* :  The problem is that no one knows how Trump will behave.
*04:39.180- 04:40.340* :  This is the situation.
*04:40.600- 04:42.380* :  But I want to emphasize something very important.
*04:43.500- 04:47.260* :  We think that Putin will try to resolve the power issue
*04:48.000- 04:50.380* :  before the election of the next year's President.
*04:51.280- 04:54.500* :  He will not risk leaving the issue of our territory for later,
*04:54.660- 04:56.780* :  given who will be the next President.
*04:56.820- 05:01.480* :  President Zelensky has said that he will be the next president
*05:01.480- 05:03.660* :  for later, given who will be the next President.
*05:03.940- 05:07.580* :  President Zelensky has warned that if you don't get the American aid, you'll lose the war.
*05:08.600- 05:12.620* :  It's very dangerous to make such statements for our society.
*05:13.440- 05:16.020* :  President Zelensky, as president of our country,
*05:16.340- 05:18.360* :  is naturally very worried about this,
*05:18.780- 05:21.100* :  because he is responsible for all Ukraine.
*05:21.780- 05:24.540* :  Russian forces recently took Advidka.
*05:24.940- 05:28.320* :  They're now pressing in at least five directions.
*05:29.020- 05:32.600* :  It's being said that the ratio is now a seven-to-one
*05:33.220- 05:36.140* :  in terms of Russian personnel and weaponry.
*05:36.140- 05:39.620* :  Are you outnumbered and outgunned on the front lines?
*05:40.100- 05:44.400* :  We're asking our partners in the West and the European Union
*05:44.540- 05:45.720* :  to help us with weapons,
*05:45.720- 05:48.760* :  so that you don't have to fight with Russia yourselves.
*05:49.780- 05:52.280* :  Russia's task is not only to destroy our nation.
*05:52.740- 05:55.340* :  Russia's task is to break up the European Union.
*05:55.940- 05:57.040* :  There is a threat to Russia.
*05:57.780- 05:59.220* :  And they know it.
*05:59.360- 06:02.560* :  It is much easier to them to negotiate separately with each country.
*06:03.360- 06:04.220* :  This is Putin's goal.
*06:05.320- 06:08.900* :  I'd like Donald Off speaking to Least who said about the challenges his country's facing
*06:08.940- 06:12.080* :  as Ukraine enters the third year of the war.
*06:12.660- 06:15.760* :  Let's turn out to Russia how have things changed there
*06:15.760- 06:18.020* :  since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.
*06:18.020- 06:22.180* :  Alexander Baunov is the editor-in-chief of the Russia and Eurasia program
*06:22.180- 06:26.640* :  at the Think Tank V. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in the U.S.
*06:27.140- 06:28.620* :  He spoke to James Kumara Sami.
*06:29.220- 06:31.660* :  Putin is waging war on two fronts.
*06:32.020- 06:33.420* :  One is against Ukraine.
*06:33.500- 06:37.200* :  Another is against the citizens of its own country.
*06:37.660- 06:43.180* :  In these two years, Russia became from a modern sort of dictatorship,
*06:43.220- 06:47.600* :  smart dictatorship, dictatorship in disguise with institutions,
*06:48.440- 06:50.480* :  controlled elections, controlled media,
*06:50.740- 06:53.780* :  into a full-scale classical-style dictatorship
*06:53.780- 06:56.380* :  of fear, repressions and terror.
*06:56.500- 07:00.660* :  And it's not impossible to ignore when you are inside the country.
*07:01.000- 07:07.120* :  And how does that become reflected on individuals on individual level, if you like?
*07:07.360- 07:07.940* :  Very simple.
*07:07.940- 07:13.680* :  Russian citizens used to have some rights, the rights to protest and to take on the streets
*07:14.280- 07:17.280* :  all 20 years of Putin's rule before the war.
*07:17.500- 07:18.680* :  It was a possibility.
*07:18.960- 07:19.760* :  It's not anymore.
*07:20.460- 07:23.020* :  Then, yes, the media were not free.
*07:23.020- 07:28.420* :  But in this unfree space, there were some bubbles, some pockets of free media,
*07:29.500- 07:30.420* :  accessible to everybody.
*07:30.420- 07:32.260* :  They were destroyed immediately.
*07:32.300- 07:35.160* :  They were banned immediately in March of 2022.
*07:35.820- 07:41.240* :  Then intellectual life has so many restrictions now that you cannot talk about
*07:41.240- 07:44.980* :  the normal university process, normal intellectual discussion.
*07:45.020- 07:46.580* :  It's not existing anymore.
*07:46.780- 07:50.320* :  It's all under total state control culture.
*07:50.540- 07:56.540* :  Imagine that out of the sudden, dozens of the most famous artists are
*07:56.780- 08:02.260* :  leaving the country, or when they stay in the country are not loyal enough to the war,
*08:02.500- 08:06.480* :  so they're not supporting the war, have been banned from performing.
*08:06.800- 08:13.140* :  The legends of Russian rock who were opposing the Soviet regime in 70s and 80s,
*08:13.340- 08:19.120* :  and were playing rock music in 70s and 80s, have been banned for the second time of their life.
*08:19.780- 08:24.160* :  How would you compare this current mood in Russian society,
*08:24.160- 08:29.760* :  the restrictions, the suppression of free speech-free thought to previous periods in Russian history?
*08:30.020- 08:34.700* :  I remember, wait for it, you know, which in many aspects is similar,
*08:34.700- 08:41.340* :  with underground culture, band musicians, street ideology, strong anti-Western rhetoric.
*08:42.100- 08:44.340* :  Now, it's universal sub-respect.
*08:44.860- 08:52.640* :  The political imprisonments we have in recent years, people sentenced to terms and prison of 9, 10,
*08:52.880- 08:54.480* :  or even 20 and more years.
*08:54.500- 08:58.380* :  It didn't exist before 2022, in Putin's time.
*08:58.540- 09:03.740* :  And now the main opponent of the regime of Alexey Navalny was not only sentenced for 19 years,
*09:03.740- 09:07.180* :  for political accusation, and then he died of a skill.
*09:07.640- 09:10.360* :  So in many aspects, it seems harsh.
*09:11.360- 09:14.820* :  Alexander Baunov speaking to James Kumara Sami.
*09:16.240- 09:21.480* :  It's been more than a week since the Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny died in a Siberian jail.
*09:21.500- 09:26.460* :  His family and supporters say he was murdered on the orders of President Putin,
*09:26.920- 09:31.080* :  a claim the Kremlin denies. Mr Navalny's body had been kept by the authorities,
*09:31.080- 09:36.780* :  but after a very public spat with Russian officials, it was handed over to his mother on Saturday.
*09:37.340- 09:39.920* :  Here's our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhardt.
*09:40.240- 09:45.080* :  The fact that the body was handed over has been confirmed by Alexey Navalny's spokeswoman, Kiry Yamish.
*09:45.420- 09:47.220* :  She said it's not clear when there will be a funeral,
*09:47.220- 09:53.160* :  nor whether officials will interfere with it, so whether it will indeed be the type of funeral the family want
*09:53.160- 09:55.320* :  and Alexey Navalny himself deserves.
*09:56.000- 10:01.020* :  Alexey Navalny's allies have said that his mother, Ludmilla, has been blackmailed basically
*10:01.020- 10:04.000* :  to try to hold a funeral in secret without mourners.
*10:04.360- 10:06.660* :  So that may still, of course, happen. We don't know.
*10:07.060- 10:11.200* :  It's also not clear whether there will be an independent autopsy conducted.
*10:11.240- 10:15.020* :  We've seen a lot, haven't we, in recent days of Alexey Navalny's widow?
*10:15.440- 10:18.520* :  Julia, and earlier, she released another hard-hitting video.
*10:19.060- 10:23.480* :  Yeah, this was an absolutely extraordinary six-minute-long attack, a very personal,
*10:23.500- 10:29.200* :  excoriating comments. She was dressed in black. She spoke directly to the camera from exile,
*10:29.200- 10:30.920* :  I hastened to add, in Russian.
*10:31.260- 10:34.080* :  And she accused President Putin again of murdering her husband
*10:34.540- 10:38.060* :  and of torturing both him in life and death and his mother.
*10:38.560- 10:44.240* :  She also challenged the Russian leader very directly on his public displays of
*10:44.240- 10:46.720* :  profess devotion to Russian Orthodox Christianity.
*10:46.720- 10:52.080* :  She spoke over images of President Putin gazing at icons, kissing relics,
*10:52.380- 10:56.880* :  even getting into a pool cut in the ice for a dip for epiphany.
*10:57.220- 10:58.740* :  The pool was in the shape of the cross.
*10:58.740- 11:03.780* :  She said all this was fake, especially when he considering how he had treated
*11:03.780- 11:06.740* :  her husband's body, accusing him of satanism.
*11:07.120- 11:08.820* :  And we'll hear this from her now.
*11:12.180- 11:14.120* :  Faith is not about kissing an icon.
*11:14.640- 11:17.480* :  Faith is about goodness, mercy, and salvation.
*11:17.500- 11:22.760* :  And no good Christian could ever do what Putin is now doing with the body of Alexey.
*11:23.260- 11:26.200* :  Alexey was a religious man. It was important to him.
*11:26.200- 11:29.460* :  He went to church. He fasted even in prison.
*11:30.180- 11:33.440* :  His policy and beliefs are largely based on Christian values.
*11:34.180- 11:37.480* :  But Faith has nothing to do with Putin's obscurantism.
*11:38.060- 11:40.480* :  The YouTube video itself, in the first eight hours,
*11:40.540- 11:43.480* :  had accrued more than one and a half million views.
*11:43.540- 11:47.160* :  We don't know how many of those were in Russia itself.
*11:47.160- 11:53.420* :  The Kremlin has called accusations of President Putin might have murdered Alexey Navalny hysterical.
*11:53.420- 11:59.380* :  It doesn't want him to be more of a martyr to the Russian opposition than he or she is.
*11:59.820- 12:03.600* :  And doesn't want his body to be a focus for public dissent.
*12:04.360- 12:05.340* :  Danny Aberhardt there.
*12:06.520- 12:11.320* :  Police in the Austrian capital Vienna are investigating the killing of four women and a girl
*12:11.320- 12:14.120* :  in two separate incidents in 24 hours.
*12:14.620- 12:17.280* :  Three of the victims were stabbed to death in a brothel.
*12:17.560- 12:18.900* :  Bethany Bell reports from Vienna.
*12:19.740- 12:23.920* :  In a statement, the Vienna police said they'd arrested a 27-year-old man
*12:23.920- 12:28.440* :  who was found hiding in the bushes near the brothel with a knife in his hand.
*12:28.500- 12:32.660* :  The suspect has been questioned and investigations continue.
*12:32.660- 12:37.960* :  In a separate incident, police are searching for the husband and father of a woman in her daughter
*12:37.960- 12:43.580* :  who were found dead in their flat. Investigators suspect the father may have strangled them.
*12:43.680- 12:47.780* :  The Austrian campaigners have called on the government to take urgent action
*12:47.780- 12:50.500* :  to stop violence against women.
*12:51.160- 12:52.160* :  Bethany Bell reporting.
*12:53.520- 12:58.700* :  Of all the documentary films nominated for an Academy Award or Oscar this year,
*12:58.840- 13:04.800* :  it's fair to say that to kill a tiger is perhaps the most harrowing in terms of subject matter.
*13:04.800- 13:07.060* :  The title suggests it's a wildlife film.
*13:07.500- 13:12.360* :  In fact, it's about an Indian farmer's struggle to seek redress for his young daughter
*13:12.620- 13:17.200* :  who is raped while attending a family wedding in a North Indian village.
*13:17.620- 13:19.760* :  One of her attackers was a cousin.
*13:20.500- 13:24.480* :  Statistics reveal a woman is raped every 20 minutes in India
*13:24.760- 13:28.500* :  and about 90 per cent of these crimes go unreported.
*13:29.000- 13:32.160* :  Nisha Pahuja is the director of Tequila Tiger
*13:32.580- 13:35.120* :  and told Julian Warica more about the film.
*13:35.800- 13:39.940* :  It is literally about a father who decides to seek justice
*13:39.940- 13:43.800* :  after his 13-year-old daughter is sexually assaulted by three men.
*13:43.920- 13:48.040* :  The villagers want him to marry her to one of the men who raped her
*13:48.220- 13:52.000* :  and the entire family stands firm, including her.
*13:52.660- 13:57.880* :  And she in some way really is the moral heart of the film, her recognition
*13:57.900- 14:01.020* :  that she deserved justice never wavered.
*14:01.240- 14:06.120* :  And that is the strength that carried both her father and her mother to the end.
*14:06.320- 14:10.300* :  You mentioned the attitudes they came against in the village.
*14:11.180- 14:12.960* :  How widespread were they?
*14:12.980- 14:15.140* :  I mean, was that very much a majority view?
*14:15.440- 14:15.920* :  Oh, yeah.
*14:16.080- 14:20.480* :  And I would say probably in that region, yes, that would have been the majority view.
*14:20.740- 14:24.740* :  The people in the community, including the families of the boys,
*14:25.100- 14:27.180* :  did not condone what their sons had done.
*14:27.440- 14:29.400* :  They just didn't want their sons to be punished
*14:29.400- 14:33.320* :  because they didn't understand the severity of what they had done.
*14:33.660- 14:36.980* :  There's definitely an attitude of, you know, she brought it upon herself.
*14:37.380- 14:38.280* :  She's also to blame.
*14:38.560- 14:42.000* :  And in taking the stand that her father did that Ranjid did,
*14:42.520- 14:44.720* :  I mean, how big a risk was he taking?
*14:44.980- 14:47.960* :  Well, in this particular case, the stakes were life and death.
*14:48.180- 14:49.940* :  Fortunately, it didn't come to that.
*14:50.120- 14:51.440* :  I think he did it for two reasons.
*14:51.520- 14:54.320* :  I mean, obviously because of the love of his child.
*14:54.320- 14:57.380* :  But I think Ranjid fundamentally, as a human being,
*14:57.380- 15:02.160* :  is someone who has a really strong sense of human rights,
*15:02.180- 15:03.660* :  a need for equality.
*15:03.660- 15:06.740* :  I think there's just something about him that's very special.
*15:07.040- 15:08.680* :  There were death threats, weren't there?
*15:08.940- 15:11.780* :  Yeah, but we only sort of talked about one in the film,
*15:11.980- 15:13.400* :  but it happened more than once.
*15:13.720- 15:14.860* :  You know, there were the death threats.
*15:14.860- 15:17.180* :  There were the offer to pay bribes.
*15:17.400- 15:20.080* :  There was cajoling kind of emotional blackmail.
*15:20.320- 15:22.360* :  There was obviously the social ostracization.
*15:22.700- 15:25.780* :  There was a lot of pressure on him to drop the case.
*15:26.080- 15:27.320* :  Which he never did.
*15:27.320- 15:29.720* :  What eventually happened to the rapist?
*15:30.180- 15:30.980* :  They were sentenced.
*15:30.980- 15:35.360* :  The case is now at the high court, but the men are still on prison.
*15:35.700- 15:38.480* :  How did the villagers feel like they have a respect for Ranjid now?
*15:38.880- 15:41.340* :  Because of the fact that he didn't back down.
*15:41.500- 15:44.480* :  The fathers of the boys are speaking to Ranjid.
*15:44.540- 15:45.480* :  They're on talking terms again.
*15:45.920- 15:47.840* :  His daughter was 13 when she was attacked.
*15:47.840- 15:51.480* :  She's 20 now, and she does eventually appear we see her, don't we?
*15:52.020- 15:52.080* :  Yes.
*15:52.620- 15:55.440* :  The reason that she chose to come forward was to celebrate her courage.
*15:55.740- 15:59.320* :  She was sort of in awe of her 13-year-old self when she watched the film.
*15:59.440- 16:03.960* :  It is about removing the stigma of shame that surrounds survivors.
*16:04.340- 16:05.440* :  She's done nothing wrong.
*16:05.700- 16:09.220* :  It's so important that she is willing to kind of step forward
*16:09.620- 16:11.280* :  and be proud of what she achieved.
*16:11.420- 16:17.460* :  What does this film say do you think about the wider issue of violence against women in India?
*16:17.780- 16:24.460* :  I like to think of it as something that speaks to the larger issue of violence against women around the world.
*16:24.760- 16:28.900* :  And I do think that that's one of the reasons that the film really resonates for people
*16:28.960- 16:30.580* :  and it really resonates for women.
*16:30.680- 16:34.520* :  It's because I think there's not a woman on the planet or a girl on the planet
*16:35.260- 16:42.700* :  who doesn't walk through the world feeling that her body can be violated at any moment.
*16:42.900- 16:46.840* :  I've had many people reach out to me from the United States and the UK and France
*16:46.960- 16:50.940* :  who talk about the court system and what they've had to navigate
*16:50.940- 16:52.660* :  and how frustrating it is.
*16:52.920- 16:57.180* :  And the experience of watching Kieran was so familiar to them.
*16:57.300- 17:01.860* :  What she went through is not just what a girl or woman in India goes through.
*17:01.860- 17:04.560* :  It's what women and girls go through around the world.
*17:05.160- 17:10.080* :  Nisha Pahuja, director of the Oscar-nominated documentary to kill a tiger.
*17:12.960- 17:16.540* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast amid dwindling support,
*17:16.540- 17:20.400* :  South Africa's governing party launches its election campaign.
*17:20.500- 17:26.440* :  We will tackle the high cost of living, invest in our people,
*17:27.360- 17:30.660* :  defend democracy and advance freedom.
*17:38.940- 17:44.020* :  The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNWAR has suspended its aid deliveries
*17:44.020- 17:49.380* :  to the north of Gaza amid increasing reports of pockets of famine in the territory.
*17:52.540- 17:56.240* :  The amount of aid getting into Gaza has been far lower in the past few months of war
*17:56.380- 17:57.360* :  than it was before.
*17:57.820- 18:00.160* :  The situation has been especially bad in the north.
*18:00.700- 18:03.380* :  Very little aid of any kind has been able to get through to Palestinians
*18:03.380- 18:06.900* :  still living in the area that was first to come under all-out attack
*18:06.900- 18:09.520* :  in Israel's ground offensive against Hamas.
*18:09.900- 18:13.200* :  The World Food Programme suspended its operation there a few days ago
*18:13.200- 18:14.360* :  for security reasons.
*18:14.900- 18:16.560* :  Now UNRA has done the same.
*18:16.560- 18:20.040* :  It says that convoys can't get through safely, in part,
*18:20.100- 18:26.060* :  because in the agency's words, hungry and exhausted people have been trying to seize aid from the trucks.
*18:26.620- 18:29.240* :  UNRA has stressed that it doesn't blame the Gaza's themselves
*18:29.840- 18:31.980* :  but the desperate conditions in which they're living.
*18:32.980- 18:37.120* :  Sebastian Asher, the Hamas-run health authority in Gaza
*18:37.120- 18:40.820* :  said more than 100 people were killed during air strikes on sites,
*18:40.820- 18:45.240* :  including Khan Unis and Raffa over the latest 24-hour period.
*18:45.620- 18:48.040* :  As Israel's bombardment of parts of Gaza continues,
*18:48.400- 18:50.760* :  negotiators have returned from talks in Paris,
*18:50.760- 18:55.200* :  reportedly with an outline of a cease-fire deal with more on that.
*18:55.200- 18:56.660* :  Here's Jenny Hill in Jerusalem.
*18:57.200- 19:00.320* :  In Israel, reports suggest a significant progress made
*19:00.320- 19:03.420* :  that the delegation has come back with what's being described
*19:03.420- 19:08.980* :  as the outline of a deal upon which further negotiations can then continue.
*19:08.980- 19:12.400* :  So what we don't know at this stage is how basic that framework is
*19:12.860- 19:17.440* :  but it is due to be presented to Israel's war cabinet at some point this evening,
*19:17.440- 19:19.700* :  and they're due to vote on it.
*19:20.120- 19:24.020* :  And now in the meantime, a senior Palestinian official has told the BBC
*19:24.360- 19:27.340* :  that actually no real progress has been made
*19:27.340- 19:33.260* :  and has accused negotiators of in effect trying to leak what he says inaccurate information
*19:33.320- 19:35.460* :  in order to put pressure on Hamas.
*19:36.000- 19:39.400* :  What we do know is that over the last week or so,
*19:39.720- 19:41.380* :  there does seem to have been a little bit of a shift.
*19:41.540- 19:43.980* :  And we've gone from last weekend when you had Benjamin Netanyahu,
*19:43.980- 19:49.060* :  the Israeli Prime Minister, saying that Hamas' negotiating position was delusional.
*19:49.480- 19:52.380* :  A few days later, if one of his ministers was saying,
*19:52.380- 19:56.920* :  actually, there are preliminary indications of a possibility towards progress.
*19:57.640- 20:03.080* :  During the week, Hamas' political leadership met with Egyptian officials in Cairo
*20:03.440- 20:08.480* :  and Washington's senior Middle East envoy was also in both Egypt and Israel
*20:08.480- 20:14.480* :  where he held talks with Benjamin Netanyahu before the delegation went to Paris for these talks.
*20:14.480- 20:20.380* :  I think the negotiators feel pressure because the US wants to get a deal done before Ramadan,
*20:20.380- 20:22.760* :  which begins on March the 10th.
*20:23.220- 20:27.980* :  And of course, Israel has said that if its hostages are not returned by the start of Ramadan,
*20:28.440- 20:32.100* :  it will go ahead with those plans for a major ground offensive
*20:32.100- 20:37.320* :  in the southern city of Raffa, where well over a million Palestinian displaced civilians are sheltering.
*20:38.140- 20:39.320* :  Jenny Hill in Jerusalem.
*20:40.320- 20:45.980* :  Britain's governing party has suspended the parliamentary membership of a high-profile MP.
*20:45.980- 20:50.900* :  After he claimed that the mayor of London was, in his words, under the control of Islamists.
*20:51.260- 20:54.600* :  Lee Anderson, previously one of the conservative parties, Deputy Chairman,
*20:54.600- 20:56.680* :  made the comments on live television.
*20:57.300- 21:00.460* :  The remarks drew this response from London's mayor, Citi Khan,
*21:00.500- 21:04.520* :  who is himself a Muslim and a member of the main opposition Labour Party.
*21:05.000- 21:09.840* :  These comments from a Citi Conservative are Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist.
*21:10.380- 21:15.800* :  And I'm afraid the deafening silence from Rishisunak and from the cabinet confirms
*21:15.800- 21:19.760* :  so many people across the country that there's a hierarchy when it comes to racism.
*21:20.100- 21:23.900* :  I think it's really important to call out anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia,
*21:24.540- 21:28.620* :  but surely it must also be important to call out anti-Muslim hatred.
*21:29.400- 21:31.900* :  For more on this, I've been talking to Katie Balls,
*21:31.900- 21:35.440* :  a political editor of the Conservative Leaning Spectator magazine.
*21:35.920- 21:41.000* :  I've spoken to some Tory MPs who want to speak out of what they see as Islamist extremism,
*21:41.480- 21:45.660* :  but they feel as though Lee Anderson's comments come across as anti-Muslim,
*21:45.960- 21:47.440* :  rather than anti-extremism.
*21:47.580- 21:53.100* :  So I don't think he has many defenders, but of course there are some Tory MPs who have not commented
*21:53.440- 21:57.740* :  and you could still see I think some support for Lee Anderson in parts of the party
*21:57.740- 22:01.960* :  because he is quite a popular figure and particularly with the 2019 intake.
*22:02.140- 22:05.620* :  He has seen a someone who often the past is praised for his straight talking.
*22:05.820- 22:10.160* :  And to a point, Rishisunak quite liked the fact that Lee Anderson is straight talking
*22:10.160- 22:11.360* :  and a little bit controversial.
*22:11.600- 22:15.300* :  He made him deputy chairman of the Tory party in part for that reason.
*22:15.560- 22:18.480* :  But of course the risk is you'll never too far away from a controversy
*22:18.500- 22:21.680* :  which is actually quite hard to come back from and that's what's happened here.
*22:22.180- 22:26.740* :  What does all this say Katie about the state of British politics and society?
*22:27.120- 22:31.620* :  Well I think we saw this week in the House of Parliament how charged the mood is right now
*22:31.680- 22:35.560* :  when it came to an opposition day motion honestly inspired in Gaza
*22:36.020- 22:39.720* :  and the Speaker changing convention because MPs worried about harassment
*22:39.720- 22:42.100* :  from groups if they voted in certain ways.
*22:42.100- 22:46.620* :  And the situation in the Middle East is heightening tensions here.
*22:47.260- 22:51.040* :  Rishisunak is hoping by taking this decisive action, be it the next day,
*22:51.280- 22:54.640* :  they're drawing a line and saying actually there is a line that you cannot cross
*22:54.640- 22:57.740* :  when it comes to some of the language some of the debates will be having.
*22:57.900- 23:02.660* :  I think there's a question now as to whether this does split the Tory party
*23:03.080- 23:07.440* :  and whether he now potentially defects to a party further to the right such as reform.
*23:07.500- 23:10.660* :  I think this debate is going to still be quite messy for some time to come.
*23:10.920- 23:12.360* :  Do you think he is likely to defect?
*23:12.860- 23:17.920* :  I think the question is is there a way back for Lee Anderson to become a Tory MP again?
*23:18.040- 23:24.500* :  But also if there isn't the problem he might have is we know the reform party has tried to convince MPs like Lee Anderson.
*23:24.500- 23:30.160* :  Two step across and you could argue Lee Anderson doesn't have much to lose right now.
*23:30.160- 23:32.040* :  So I think it's definitely a possibility.
*23:33.220- 23:35.120* :  Katie Balls of the Spectator magazine.
*23:36.320- 23:41.100* :  South Africa's governing ANC has launched its election campaign hoping to overcome
*23:41.100- 23:43.980* :  anger about high unemployment and a weakening economy.
*23:44.420- 23:49.140* :  Polls suggest the party could lose its parliamentary majority in the election on the 29th of May
*23:49.140- 23:52.620* :  for the first time since the fall of apartheid 30 years ago.
*23:53.060- 23:56.180* :  At the launch of the ANC's election manifesto.
*23:56.500- 24:01.220* :  President Cyril Ramaphosa promised to build on what he called the successes of the last three decades.
*24:01.220- 24:08.580* :  Our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton reports in power since the first democratic elections in 1994.
*24:09.580- 24:13.220* :  The ANC has recently suffered a sharp decline in support,
*24:13.220- 24:17.540* :  beset by allegations of corruption and mismanagement.
*24:18.320- 24:22.740* :  But inside a packed football stadium in Durban, you wouldn't have noticed.
*24:31.760- 24:39.400* :  President Ramaphosa insists that if South Africans keep voting for the ANC, things can only get better.
*24:40.060- 24:42.860* :  We will tackle the high cost of living.
*24:43.800- 24:47.220* :  We will also invest in our people.
*24:48.180- 24:52.960* :  We will defend democracy and advance freedom.
*24:54.100- 25:00.580* :  And we will continue to build a better Africa and a better world.
*25:01.260- 25:06.600* :  But with an economic slowdown, high unemployment, crime and persistent power cuts,
*25:06.600- 25:12.980* :  the audience outside the stadium may feel these promises are beginning to sound a little hollow.
*25:13.780- 25:17.720* :  The main challenges in the next election are the democratic alliance,
*25:17.720- 25:21.900* :  which was always seen as representing white conservative voters,
*25:22.500- 25:25.420* :  and Julius Malema's economic freedom fighters,
*25:25.920- 25:30.720* :  which has a more radical agenda of seizing land and nationalizing mines.
*25:31.600- 25:39.480* :  But most Black South Africans are still profoundly grateful to the ANC for liberating them from apartheid.
*25:39.960- 25:47.200* :  And despite dire predictions in the opinion polls, the ANC remains a formidable election-winning machine.
*25:48.020- 25:51.560* :  So reports of its demise may be greatly exaggerated.
*25:52.880- 25:53.420* :  Richard Hamilton.
*25:54.520- 25:57.080* :  Now, can you believe he said this?
*25:57.200- 26:00.040* :  That's the caption of Georgia Ball's viral video,
*26:00.560- 26:05.520* :  in which the professional female golfer is given unsolicited advice by a random man.
*26:05.520- 26:08.860* :  The TikTok post has resonated with those who watched it,
*26:08.860- 26:11.640* :  with many people sharing their experiences of mansplaining,
*26:11.640- 26:16.940* :  which refers to men dishing out unnecessary advice to women in a condescending manner.
*26:17.220- 26:18.380* :  And at Aslam, can tell us more.
*26:20.240- 26:22.980* :  Georgia Ball spends a lot of time at the driving range,
*26:22.980- 26:26.520* :  practicing her swing and posting coaching videos on social media.
*26:27.100- 26:29.200* :  As she sends the ball flying into the distance,
*26:29.200- 26:33.880* :  a male voice off camera repeatedly chips in with unsolicited dips.
*26:45.760- 26:48.040* :  The professional golfer looks taken aback,
*26:48.040- 26:53.280* :  but thanks the unknown man explains that she's changing her swing and hits a perfect shot.
*26:55.160- 26:57.300* :  Which the man then takes credit for.
*26:57.800- 27:00.320* :  Georgia told the BBC it was an awkward conversation,
*27:00.400- 27:04.480* :  but she didn't feel comfortable shutting it down by pointing out that she's a pro.
*27:04.860- 27:08.440* :  I'm quite a humble person, so for me to turn around and say,
*27:08.440- 27:12.320* :  I am a PG pro, I know what I'm doing, it's just not in me to do that.
*27:12.500- 27:16.060* :  The 92nd video has been viewed more than 10 million times,
*27:16.060- 27:20.340* :  and while many people have commended Georgia for taking the moral high ground,
*27:20.940- 27:23.980* :  there's no shortage of comments winning at the mansplaining.
*27:24.660- 27:28.440* :  Fellow professional golfer, Julie Walker, says it's a common problem in the sport.
*27:28.800- 27:30.760* :  Whenever you play in mixed competitions,
*27:30.920- 27:35.580* :  there generally is somebody in the company who's deciding that they can give you some advice.
*27:36.180- 27:39.040* :  That's the very good that male golfer.
*27:39.840- 27:41.840* :  It's very much a male dominated sport,
*27:42.280- 27:45.360* :  it's also very, very traditional in its nature.
*27:45.840- 27:50.780* :  Therefore it attracts people who like tradition and like rules,
*27:51.100- 27:55.540* :  and like women to be contained within some rules.
*27:55.940- 28:00.720* :  Georgia says golf is a beautiful game and should be a welcoming space for everyone.
*28:01.300- 28:03.000* :  She sees the funny side of the situation,
*28:03.000- 28:07.820* :  but has this advice for people who may feel the urge to impart wisdom to strangers.
*28:08.160- 28:10.840* :  We're all going through our own challenges within the game,
*28:10.840- 28:15.420* :  so if you're seeking someone's struggle, just think they are going through a change,
*28:15.500- 28:18.380* :  and maybe just be a little easier on everyone,
*28:18.500- 28:21.720* :  especially when you're on the drive range or how about you're in the gym.
*28:22.640- 28:25.260* :  Georgia Ball ending that report by Anna Aslam.
*28:26.520- 28:28.520* :  Let's return to our top story now,
*28:28.520- 28:31.280* :  and on the 2nd anniversary of Russia's invasion,
*28:31.600- 28:35.060* :  Ukraine is facing a bleaker situation than a few months ago
*28:35.060- 28:39.120* :  with shortages of men and weapons and the slow advance of Russian troops.
*28:39.600- 28:41.180* :  The head of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg,
*28:41.180- 28:44.100* :  described the situation on the battlefield as extremely serious,
*28:44.480- 28:47.120* :  but promised more support was on its way to Ukraine.
*28:47.760- 28:49.240* :  Our chief international correspondent,
*28:49.260- 28:52.340* :  Lise Desett, who was in Kiev at the start of the war
*28:52.640- 28:55.100* :  and has visited Ukraine many times since.
*28:55.600- 29:01.800* :  Amel Rajin spoke to her in the capital and began by asking if Western fatigue was taking its toll.
*29:02.420- 29:04.280* :  The refrain is exactly the same.
*29:04.280- 29:07.920* :  Please don't forget us, we need your military support.
*29:07.920- 29:10.860* :  Yes, we're grateful, but if you don't help us,
*29:11.240- 29:15.100* :  it's too dangerous a thought to think that they will not win this war.
*29:15.300- 29:19.220* :  President Putin has framed this as an existential war
*29:19.220- 29:22.420* :  for Ukraine's identity and territory,
*29:22.420- 29:25.440* :  saying that Ukraine rightfully belongs to Russia,
*29:26.100- 29:27.320* :  so they can't give up this fight.
*29:27.320- 29:31.160* :  And I have to say they find it difficult to understand why,
*29:31.640- 29:32.940* :  even though the West is so generous,
*29:32.940- 29:35.220* :  why they keep stalling this critical aid
*29:35.220- 29:37.880* :  that they don't seem to really, really understand
*29:38.520- 29:40.340* :  that this war is not just Ukraine's war,
*29:40.340- 29:42.400* :  that if President Putin wins here,
*29:42.840- 29:44.080* :  the war won't stop in Ukraine.
*29:44.900- 29:49.380* :  President Putin initially described this as a special military operation,
*29:49.380- 29:51.780* :  a phrase that Steve Rosenberg, our colleague in Moscow,
*29:51.780- 29:53.120* :  often reminds us of.
*29:53.120- 29:56.480* :  Did you think, Lise, when you went to Ukraine two years ago,
*29:56.960- 29:59.200* :  that two years on, you'd still be covering this conflict,
*29:59.200- 30:02.400* :  which was meant to be a short term win for Putin, as he saw it?
*30:02.820- 30:03.760* :  Oh, there's so many memories.
*30:03.760- 30:07.100* :  I remember sitting on a rooftop with Nick Robinson
*30:07.100- 30:09.100* :  with the air raid sirens blowing off
*30:09.100- 30:10.320* :  in the sound of explosions,
*30:10.320- 30:13.080* :  and be looking at him and hearing the reports
*30:13.080- 30:14.360* :  from an entry analyst saying,
*30:14.360- 30:16.280* :  well, Russian tanks have crossed the border,
*30:16.920- 30:18.480* :  that they'll be in the center of key within days,
*30:18.480- 30:22.500* :  and then Ukrainians stood up and dazzled and inspired the world
*30:22.540- 30:23.460* :  by fighting back.
*30:23.460- 30:26.500* :  They had been so underestimated by the world
*30:26.500- 30:29.100* :  and Russia so overestimated,
*30:29.100- 30:31.760* :  and there's been this refrain from the beginning,
*30:31.760- 30:33.260* :  at least in the first war.
*30:33.480- 30:35.020* :  This is a war we can and will win.
*30:35.440- 30:37.500* :  And last year, I remember hearing, on this very day,
*30:37.500- 30:40.000* :  I remember hearing President Zelensky saying
*30:40.000- 30:42.120* :  that the war would be over this year,
*30:42.120- 30:44.940* :  and I thought, wow, that is dangerous to say,
*30:44.940- 30:49.140* :  because it doesn't look like they'll win on the battlefield.
*30:49.140- 30:52.800* :  And now, for the first time, Ukrainians are admitting,
*30:52.800- 30:55.480* :  this is going to be a long war.
*30:55.480- 30:59.360* :  They've lost so much, and they know they won't get their old lives back,
*30:59.360- 31:03.500* :  but they missed at least some predictability in their lives.
*31:03.500- 31:05.500* :  And I think those of us who live in,
*31:05.500- 31:08.100* :  no country is perfect, even in peacetime,
*31:08.100- 31:10.700* :  there are problems, you know, costs of living crisis,
*31:11.700- 31:14.220* :  difficulty, security issues, but when you live in war,
*31:14.800- 31:16.480* :  as I always say, the war lives in you,
*31:17.020- 31:19.220* :  and it just permeates everything.
*31:19.740- 31:21.480* :  And Zelensky, I should just finally ask you,
*31:21.480- 31:24.420* :  it's fetted by the West, and lauded by the West a couple of years ago,
*31:24.800- 31:27.140* :  is his position still secured, you think he, at least?
*31:27.380- 31:30.360* :  Well, I'm all, Ukraine prides itself on being a democracy.
*31:30.380- 31:33.480* :  There's always the rough and tumble of politics.
*31:33.480- 31:35.480* :  He has made some unpopular decisions,
*31:35.480- 31:38.480* :  and his ratings are down, but he is the man in charge,
*31:38.480- 31:39.980* :  and the issue is the war.
*31:41.000- 31:42.420* :  Leads to set in care.
*31:44.840- 31:47.160* :  That's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition
*31:47.160- 31:49.480* :  of the Global News Podcast at the same time tomorrow.
