*02:00.520- 02:05.480* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 9th of February, these are our main stories.
*02:06.120- 02:12.080* :  President Biden insists his memory is fine. After a US prosecutor questioned his ability to
*02:12.080- 02:17.660* :  remember key events in his life. As Israel steps up its attacks on the guards and city of Raffa,
*02:17.660- 02:25.000* :  we hear about the latest loss of life there. My father and my mother died and also my little brother.
*02:26.400- 02:30.720* :  He was three years old. My only brother. He was only three years old.
*02:32.360- 02:35.540* :  Pakistan is just closer to knowing the results of a general election
*02:35.620- 02:38.740* :  marred by allegations of vote rigging and violence.
*02:41.980- 02:47.980* :  Also in this podcast, Tucker Carlson releases his much-touted interview with President Putin
*02:48.420- 02:51.520* :  that fails to challenge him on the war in Ukraine.
*02:56.160- 03:01.320* :  There have long been rumblings of concern about the US President Joe Biden's age and abilities
*03:01.320- 03:06.540* :  to do his job. So the findings of a special counsel looking into his handling of classified
*03:06.540- 03:11.020* :  documents have caused a storm. The investigator in the case, Robert Herr,
*03:11.160- 03:17.860* :  said the president would not face criminal charges because a jury was likely to view him sympathetically
*03:17.860- 03:24.980* :  as a, quote, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. Mr. Herr said that when questioned,
*03:24.980- 03:30.580* :  Mr. Biden had forgotten when he was Vice President and when his son had died of cancer.
*03:31.440- 03:35.700* :  At a hastily arranged news conference, the US President hit back.
*03:48.160- 03:53.300* :  How on the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself
*03:54.080- 04:00.500* :  wasn't any of their damn business. Let me tell you something. Some of you have come and I
*04:00.500- 04:04.940* :  wear since the day he died every single day that rose when he got from our lady.
*04:09.420- 04:12.260* :  Every Memorial Day we hold a service remembering him attending
*04:12.260- 04:18.160* :  by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don't need anyone. I don't need anyone.
*04:19.160- 04:25.520* :  Remind me when he passed away. So how damaging has all this been for Mr.
*04:25.520- 04:30.300* :  Biden and his hopes of being reelected? John Sudworth is our North America correspondent.
*04:31.360- 04:35.960* :  It's difficult to overstate just how politically damaging this is for President Biden.
*04:35.960- 04:40.700* :  For years there's been speculation about his mental fitness for office, of course,
*04:40.700- 04:47.260* :  but beyond the odd verbal stumble and the clear physical signs of age. There's been no real evidence
*04:47.360- 04:51.360* :  that the liberal press has given it something of a wide birth. It's mainly been the province
*04:51.360- 04:58.260* :  of the right wing networks and talk shows until now. It's important to say this is a report by
*04:58.260- 05:03.120* :  the Special Counsel Robert Herr. He was appointed by the US Justice Department to look into
*05:03.780- 05:09.060* :  President Biden's handling of classified documents. A number of documents found in
*05:09.060- 05:16.620* :  probably stored at his home. Mr. Herr is a Republican by affiliation that is perhaps precisely why
*05:16.620- 05:20.840* :  he was chosen for this job. The Justice Department wanted to avoid the appearance of a biased
*05:20.840- 05:27.380* :  investigation into the missing documents. But while Democrats might grumble now at what they see
*05:27.380- 05:34.140* :  as a politically loaded attack in this report, while it has cleared Mr. Biden of legal wrongdoing
*05:34.140- 05:39.200* :  over the handling of those documents, it has opened the political floodgates nonetheless.
*05:39.740- 05:44.320* :  The polls show that many voters do have concerns about his mental and physical health.
*05:44.780- 05:50.180* :  So will any of this have helped? It's hard to say, but probably not much if at all.
*05:51.580- 05:57.240* :  John Sudworth, when earlier this week the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson confirmed that he
*05:57.240- 06:02.560* :  was in Moscow to interview President Vladimir Putin, he portrayed it as a dangerous mission.
*06:03.320- 06:08.440* :  In the end, it was a loving. Mr. Putin was in control throughout and there was limited scrutiny.
*06:09.260- 06:15.800* :  As we record this podcast, the two-hour interview has amassed more than 100 million views online.
*06:16.600- 06:20.880* :  In it, President Putin said he had no interest in invading Poland or other
*06:20.880- 06:27.080* :  NATO countries. A claim he has made in the past about Ukraine. He also said he believes a deal can
*06:27.080- 06:31.820* :  be reached to free Ivan Gershkovich, a U.S. reporter detained last year in Moscow.
*06:37.900- 06:44.100* :  We have done so many gestures of what good will out of decency that I think we have run out of them.
*06:46.180- 06:50.320* :  We have never seen anyone reciprocate to us in a similar manner.
*06:52.680- 06:56.760* :  However, in theory, we can say that we do not rule out that we can do that.
*06:58.400- 07:03.040* :  This interview comes as attempts in the U.S. to pass legislation granting new military aid
*07:03.040- 07:09.140* :  to Ukraine have stalled in Congress, and as the Ukrainian President has replaced his top military
*07:09.140- 07:13.940* :  commander. We got more on why Mr. Putin had decided to give this interview now,
*07:13.940- 07:18.660* :  from our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford, who is in the Ukrainian capital,
*07:18.660- 07:25.220* :  Kiev. The timing is important. I think we're two years almost into Russia's full-scale invasion
*07:25.220- 07:30.440* :  of Ukraine, and clearly looking at the way Mr. Putin's body language is and the way he speaks
*07:30.440- 07:34.960* :  and the way he behaves, and essentially he's feeling relatively comfortable at the moment.
*07:35.140- 07:40.440* :  I think he wanted to speak through Tucker Carlson to a particular audience in the
*07:40.440- 07:46.600* :  United States. As you mentioned, this is a time when Ukraine is waiting for very much
*07:46.600- 07:54.120* :  needed military aid from the U.S. That's been blocked by a hard-line Republicans who are essentially
*07:54.120- 07:58.340* :  playing domestic politics with the issue of Ukraine aid, and that aid is not coming through.
*07:58.340- 08:03.440* :  So I think these were messages that Putin preaching to a certain gallery in the West,
*08:03.480- 08:07.740* :  but particularly in the United States, and doing it at a time, well, of course, there are questions
*08:07.740- 08:12.780* :  about how long the West will go on supporting Ukraine for. Lots of people in Ukraine getting
*08:12.780- 08:19.160* :  quite frustrated about talk of Ukraine fatigue and question marks over aid going forward when
*08:19.160- 08:24.160* :  they were told that they would be supported for as long as it takes. And you ask people about
*08:24.160- 08:29.340* :  that here, and they say, how long is as long as it takes? Does that just mean two years that you're
*08:29.340- 08:34.340* :  about to abandon us? So I think it's kind of key timing in that sense. And it wasn't exactly a
*08:34.340- 08:39.280* :  hard-hitting interview. Why do you think Mr. Putin picked Tucker Carlson?
*08:39.600- 08:45.780* :  I think you just answered the question in the question. He did it because Tucker Carlson had
*08:45.780- 08:50.200* :  no intention of grinning him, because Tucker Carlson quite likes Vladimir Putin. He's also
*08:50.200- 08:55.180* :  fairly friendly with Donald Trump, who also likes Vladimir Putin. So this was really a platform
*08:55.180- 09:00.860* :  for Vladimir Putin to lay out his various theses that we've heard before to go through all of his
*09:00.860- 09:05.600* :  grievances and to be allowed to say pretty much what he wanted. And I think the interview really
*09:05.600- 09:11.520* :  stands out for what it didn't say, which is he was not asked about war crimes in Ukraine. He was not
*09:11.520- 09:16.940* :  asked about the high civilian casualty rate here in Ukraine. There was a lot he wasn't asked
*09:16.940- 09:23.280* :  the war that Mr. Putin started is still going on here two years in and Tucker Carlson really
*09:23.280- 09:26.740* :  wasn't asking any hard questions about that. He just let Vladimir Putin have his way.
*09:27.900- 09:33.320* :  Sarah Rainesford in Kiev. Fears are growing in Gaza that the territories southernmost city
*09:33.320- 09:37.920* :  Rafa could soon come under an Israeli ground assault after an airstrike overnight.
*09:38.720- 09:43.280* :  Footage shows bodies being pulled out from the rubble and then lined up wrapped in white sheets
*09:43.280- 09:50.420* :  as grieving relatives stand alongside. Lana Al-Mashuki's parents and siblings died in the attack.
*09:50.420- 10:00.560* :  She described what happened. We were sleeping and we suddenly woke up to the sound of
*10:00.560- 10:07.640* :  bombing. Rocks were above our heads and a fire had started. I was calling for my mother,
*10:08.060- 10:15.040* :  father and my siblings and they didn't answer me. When I woke up I couldn't find anyone in the
*10:15.040- 10:22.420* :  house except my sister. I tried to wake her up but she wouldn't wake up. Now she is in hospital.
*10:23.800- 10:31.280* :  My father and my mother died and also my little brother. He was three years old. My only brother,
*10:31.280- 10:39.240* :  he was only three years old. An estimated 1.4 million people are crammed into Rafa living in
*10:39.340- 10:46.160* :  humanitarian conditions. Many of them displaced from other parts of Gaza. Gada Uda is a journalist
*10:46.160- 10:50.460* :  among those forced to flee to Rafa. She told us what daily life was like there.
*10:51.400- 10:59.020* :  I had to evacuate from Hanyunis shelter and I had to flee now in my relative's home actually.
*10:59.200- 11:04.580* :  More than 20 people inside this small home. Babies they don't have like vaccines and
*11:04.580- 11:09.580* :  elderly people actually they don't have like medication like for high blood depression,
*11:09.580- 11:16.880* :  like diabetes. For example I lost my father two weeks ago because he has diabetes and he cannot
*11:17.760- 11:23.500* :  have his medication. He has like a brain stroke and here Gaza is running out from medication
*11:23.500- 11:29.220* :  for some chronic disease. The US has warned Israel that without proper planning a
*11:29.220- 11:34.720* :  ground assault on Rafa would be a disaster. I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem, Nick Beak,
*11:35.020- 11:40.800* :  what he'd heard from the southern Gaza city. We heard from a family last night in Rafa and they
*11:40.800- 11:47.340* :  said that the city was the sixth place they've been forced to flee to ever since the Hamas attacks
*11:47.340- 11:52.980* :  walked over the seventh and Israel's response and say that they were the short of water, of food,
*11:52.980- 11:58.280* :  of medicine, that they're living in a tent and they're all around them. There is despair and so
*11:58.280- 12:04.120* :  the prospect of a ground invasion, a larger operation on the ground from the Israelis, they say is
*12:04.400- 12:10.320* :  is absolutely petrifying. Over night from the air the Israeli forces hit Rafa once more,
*12:10.780- 12:15.860* :  a contact telling us this morning that eight people have been killed in that including
*12:15.860- 12:20.940* :  women and children and certainly there is one video which shows the very densely packed streets
*12:20.940- 12:27.960* :  in the aftermath of a strike and the body of a child is pulled from it, lifeless from the
*12:27.960- 12:34.440* :  rubble and an indication of how the suffering that continues in Rafa. And has Israel indicated what
*12:34.440- 12:41.340* :  civilians in Rafa can do to escape the possible impending military offensive because in the past
*12:41.420- 12:45.580* :  people have moved further down the Gaza Strip but there's nowhere further south for them to move
*12:45.580- 12:50.180* :  now. That is absolutely the point. People say that they have been instructed to come to this city
*12:50.180- 12:55.620* :  and it's by no means clear what people should do. Interestingly, yes they are press comments in
*12:55.620- 13:00.940* :  Washington. Journalists were asking the US State Department if they were aware of any plan
*13:01.300- 13:06.660* :  and they said that is a very valid question and one that they'd expect the Israelis to answer.
*13:06.660- 13:11.820* :  So there is this concern. The language is quite strong coming from Washington saying that basically
*13:11.820- 13:17.980* :  it would be a very bad move to launch some sort of operation into Rafa without proper planning.
*13:17.980- 13:23.780* :  They'd say it would be extremely bad and of course President Biden saying that more widely
*13:23.780- 13:29.300* :  he believes the Israelis have gone over the top in their actions. Israel, of course, saying that
*13:29.300- 13:34.780* :  they're trying to destroy Hamas and that they will continue to do that until the group has been wiped out.
*13:35.940- 13:42.220* :  Nick Beak. Fogball fever is expected to reach boiling point in ivory coast this weekend. Not only
*13:42.220- 13:47.300* :  is ivory coast hosting the Africa Cup of Nations but its team has managed to make it through to
*13:47.300- 13:53.160* :  the final and will take on Nigeria on Sunday. Local leaders have been doing much more than just
*13:53.160- 13:59.120* :  clearing their calendars though to watch the game. In some areas mass gathering such as weddings
*13:59.120- 14:06.100* :  and funerals have been banned to make sure everything runs as smoothly as possible. BBC Sport Africa's
*14:06.100- 14:12.460* :  Ian Williams reports. When it comes to the nation's Cup in ivory coast, Corrigo really is the end
*14:12.460- 14:18.980* :  of the road. By far the most northerly city, it is hot, dry and a long way from places like Avijan
*14:19.300- 14:27.900* :  both in terms of distance and feel. Tradition is important. Local Chief Issa Kulibali remains
*14:27.900- 14:34.560* :  the ultimate authority here offering mediation for local residents in dispute. A highly respected
*14:34.560- 14:41.020* :  figure when I visited his image was everywhere. Sitting on his large ornate chair and dressed in a
*14:41.020- 14:46.880* :  yellow sleeveless robe and white hat, he presented as a self assured figure as he gestured with his
*14:46.880- 14:52.100* :  small wooden stick. But the Chief has also been making national headlines for imposing a ban
*14:52.100- 14:56.840* :  on traditional wedding and funeral parties while the tournament is on. He's worried about
*14:56.840- 15:02.760* :  blocked roads, dangerous driving and big crowds making life tough for visiting fans and journalists.
*15:04.740- 15:11.520* :  If I didn't take this decision, it would be locked in your hotel rooms and we were taught by
*15:11.520- 15:18.380* :  my grandfather how to welcome foreigners and how to respect foreigners. And then you'll see what we
*15:18.380- 15:27.560* :  are able to do in welcoming people here in Corrigo. This is what a traditional wedding party can
*15:27.560- 15:33.680* :  sound like in Corrigo. It's a familiar sight to anyone who hails from here and for some like
*15:33.980- 15:38.860* :  Kulibali, these celebrations can be an inspiration for their own matrimonials.
*15:40.460- 15:45.620* :  I have seen many of them. After King Par in these weddings, it was so nice to see them
*15:46.020- 15:48.060* :  that immediately he said to Harley Sen.
*15:49.040- 15:53.740* :  Dollaru and his new wife Nadej rushed through their wedding so it took place just before the ban
*15:53.740- 15:58.400* :  came into place on New Year's Day meaning they didn't have time to plan or save for their
*15:58.400- 16:03.360* :  traditional celebration. Despite that, they aren't complaining about the chief's edict.
*16:13.960- 16:18.200* :  While it is hard to find anyone in Corrigo who will openly criticize the chief,
*16:18.200- 16:24.140* :  other people around the country have not been so shy and that condemnation has surprised local
*16:24.140- 16:28.220* :  officials. Salif Kulibali is the mayor of Corrigo's spokesperson.
*16:30.480- 16:36.780* :  In the beginning, I was shocked but quickly I understood that people didn't understand the
*16:36.860- 16:42.400* :  spirit of the chief's decision. Until after the nation's cut, you can't have any traditional
*16:42.400- 16:49.300* :  funerals but that doesn't value from bearing your dead parents. The tournament has brought
*16:49.300- 16:54.840* :  major changes to the city. New roads, medical clinics and buses are some of the reasons to celebrate.
*16:55.440- 17:00.800* :  So will the newly married Kulibali's look to have their own traditional celebration when it's allowed?
*17:05.160- 17:12.480* :  And our parents didn't have time to calm so if we have the money, we will invite them and do
*17:12.480- 17:19.020* :  some things. Fortunately, the man who really matters, chief is a Kulibali, is in agreement.
*17:19.020- 17:23.860* :  He says wedding festivities will be able to resume once Afghanistan is over.
*17:24.780- 17:29.920* :  There will be a big celebration, everyone will be free to do it and they will be happy.
*17:33.240- 17:37.800* :  And if Ivory Coast is going to lift the carbonation trophy on Sunday, expect mass celebrations,
*17:37.800- 17:40.520* :  not just here in Corrigo but all over the country.
*17:41.600- 17:43.140* :  That report by Ian William.
*17:46.500- 17:48.040* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast?
*18:00.840- 18:06.900* :  The conductor once described as Japan's most exceptional talent has died. We look back on the
*18:06.900- 18:08.600* :  life of Seji Ozawa.
*18:13.340- 18:19.860* :  We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time
*18:19.860- 18:25.880* :  when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened, not just to him,
*18:26.580- 18:31.920* :  but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
*18:32.940- 18:39.320* :  I'm Una Chaplin and from CBC Podcasts and the BBC World Service, this is Hollywood Exiles.

*19:51.900- 19:57.540* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. To Pakistan now, we're after an unusually long delay,
*19:57.540- 20:01.740* :  we're getting a clearer picture of the outcome of Thursday's general election.
*20:02.340- 20:07.960* :  Hell at a time when Pakistan is facing an economic crisis and upsurge in terrorism and worsening
*20:07.960- 20:14.240* :  tensions on the border. And it may be a bit of a shock for the country's all-powerful military,
*20:14.240- 20:20.180* :  which is seen as controlling the levers of power. As we record this podcast, more than half
*20:20.180- 20:26.100* :  the votes have been counted, and independent candidates backed by the jailed former prime minister
*20:26.100- 20:32.480* :  Imran Khan have established a clear lead over the party of the man who's thought to be the
*20:32.480- 20:38.500* :  army's preferred choice. Nowhere Sharif, another former prime minister. Malia Lodi is a former
*20:38.500- 20:45.640* :  Pakistani ambassador to the UN. What this election has done is to show how people basically
*20:45.640- 20:52.100* :  defied the narrative, which was very popular in the media, that somehow the election was a
*20:52.100- 20:58.080* :  foregone conclusion. I think the fact that people did show up in greater numbers than was predicted.
*20:58.660- 21:03.440* :  One, I think that indicated their belief in the democratic process, the fact that they thought
*21:03.440- 21:09.580* :  their vote mattered. And then when the results started coming in, it became clear how this narrative
*21:09.580- 21:17.000* :  of this foregone conclusion narrative was, in fact, very flawed. These people in Karachi spoke of
*21:17.000- 21:24.740* :  their hopes for the new government. We want a government that is good for the country and honest
*21:24.740- 21:31.100* :  too, and that works to reduce inflation. Over the last 75 years, we've seen difficulties for
*21:31.100- 21:38.820* :  the people increasing. Someone who's a good leader has to rule, who's good for the country
*21:38.820- 21:45.240* :  and for the people, good for Islam, who provides jobs, who improves health facilities, and provides
*21:45.240- 21:51.400* :  good education for everyone. A correspondent in Islamabad, Samira Hussein, gave us this update
*21:51.400- 21:58.380* :  on the results so far. We're seeing that the PTI, so that's the candidates that are rather the
*21:58.380- 22:03.840* :  independent candidates that are being supported by PTI, which is Imran Khan's political party,
*22:03.840- 22:10.560* :  are so far in the lead. Now, we only have a little more than half the results in so far.
*22:10.560- 22:16.500* :  And it's been 24 hours now or more than 24 hours since the ballots have closed. And I think there's
*22:16.940- 22:22.760* :  a growing sense of skepticism and worry amongst the voters about whether or not any of these
*22:23.260- 22:28.740* :  results may be tampered with. But right now, it looks like it's going to be all about the
*22:28.740- 22:33.080* :  independence and see in which way they're going to lean in terms of forming a government.
*22:33.740- 22:39.340* :  And Samira, there are a lot of people who are worried that this is not going to be a free and
*22:39.340- 22:45.820* :  fair election. There were a lot of concerns leading up to the election about the fairness and the
*22:45.820- 22:50.800* :  freedom of the election. As we know, Imran Khan was barred from participating in this election.
*22:50.800- 22:58.100* :  His PTI members were allowed to participate, but they weren't allowed to participate under
*22:58.100- 23:03.260* :  the banner of the PTI, so they had to run as independence. They were barred from using their
*23:03.260- 23:08.200* :  party symbol, the cricket bat. And that's actually really important when you have a country with 40
*23:08.200- 23:13.680* :  percent of the country is illiterate. These symbols next to candidates' names are really important.
*23:14.600- 23:20.420* :  And then there were the fears that a lot of these PTI supporters were facing. They were very
*23:20.420- 23:26.720* :  worried to campaign in public. And then of course, on election day, we saw that there was a blanket
*23:27.340- 23:32.140* :  shutting down of all mobile internet services, which made it really difficult to be able to
*23:32.140- 23:39.200* :  communicate where polling stations are getting people out to polling stations. And even now we're
*23:39.360- 23:44.540* :  seeing it's had an impact in terms of how we're getting the results now 24 hours later.
*23:44.860- 23:49.920* :  And yet despite all that candidates linked to Imran Khan seem to be leading,
*23:50.060- 23:55.820* :  if they were to win the most seats despite this crackdown against them, what would happen next?
*23:56.740- 24:02.740* :  Right. So it is unlikely that they will be able to win a clear majority just looking at the
*24:02.740- 24:08.980* :  results right now. So it's really going to be up to independence to find which party that they
*24:08.980- 24:12.880* :  want to pledge their allegiance to. And of course, a lot is going to depend on what their
*24:12.880- 24:18.900* :  chilled leader has to say. Samira Hussein in Pakistan. Let's go across the border now to India.
*24:19.340- 24:24.260* :  At least four people have died and dozens of others have been injured in violence in the Northern
*24:24.260- 24:29.840* :  Indian state of Uttarakhand after the authorities demolished a mosque alleging it was constructed
*24:29.840- 24:35.940* :  illegally. Rioters, torch vehicles and a police station in the city of Haldwani. In response,
*24:35.940- 24:41.780* :  the local government has imposed a shoot on site order and a curfew and has also cut internet
*24:42.300- 24:47.300* :  connections. Our South Asia region, where did her? Umbhra Sanitirajan told us more about what happened.
*24:48.360- 24:54.000* :  Now, according to local media reports that the violence has started yesterday after the authorities
*24:54.000- 25:01.280* :  who say that they were on evicting people and demolishing buildings on encroached government land
*25:01.280- 25:07.480* :  started the drive. They raised down Muslim religious place, a religious school as well as a mosque
*25:07.580- 25:13.580* :  triggered the violence with the local Muslim leaders opposing the move saying that the issue is
*25:13.740- 25:19.680* :  still in the court and they should have waited for the court's final decision and no due legal
*25:19.680- 25:25.820* :  process was followed. And that triggered anger among the local community and the police. They
*25:25.820- 25:32.560* :  have been given powers to shoot on site orders. A curfew has been imposed in that particular area
*25:33.120- 25:38.700* :  and more security forces have been deployed. So the situation is still tense and the government
*25:38.700- 25:45.240* :  has appeal for peace. But this is far from being an isolated incident. There are other mosques
*25:45.240- 25:50.700* :  that have been demolished and Muslims in India say this is all part of an agenda by the Hindu
*25:50.700- 25:56.240* :  nationalist government. Muslim community leaders have been saying that since the Hindu nationalists
*25:56.240- 26:02.120* :  of BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, there have been number of
*26:02.120- 26:07.880* :  incidents targeting the community, of course, the government denies this accusation. And few weeks
*26:07.880- 26:14.200* :  ago there was another mosque very close to the Indian capital Delhi. It was centuries-old
*26:14.200- 26:20.500* :  mosque. Again that mosque was raised down and the whole place was cleared within a few hours.
*26:21.060- 26:28.320* :  And the local community members were saying that once again no due process was followed. So this
*26:28.320- 26:33.900* :  was not an isolated incident what happened in Uttarakhand. This has triggered a lot of concerns
*26:33.900- 26:42.160* :  and worries among the Muslim community in India. There are about 180 million Muslims in India and
*26:42.160- 26:47.800* :  they are the third biggest Muslim population in the world. Now they say that the future is uncertain
*26:48.380- 26:54.440* :  under this BJP's Hindu nationalist rule. Not only that, they are being targeted in eviction
*26:54.700- 27:00.320* :  even in places like Mumbai and whenever there is any riot or violence, they say they were
*27:00.320- 27:05.780* :  unfairly being targeted. These accusations are being denied by the government saying that they
*27:06.300- 27:12.000* :  follow court orders to remove people from encroached government land because this court has
*27:12.000- 27:17.860* :  been asking people to vacate otherwise. This is causing traffic congestion and valuable government
*27:17.860- 27:24.280* :  land is being taken away by some people. But Muslim community leaders have been arguing. It is not
*27:24.280- 27:29.380* :  just simply about the mosques that place in society they are questioning. You know this all comes
*27:29.380- 27:36.920* :  in the wake of the opening of a Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya last month where once centuries
*27:36.920- 27:42.940* :  old mosque stood that was raised down to ground about 30 years ago and then the supreme court gave
*27:42.940- 27:48.580* :  that land to the Hindu community to build the temple. So this is what is making the Muslim community
*27:48.580- 27:54.340* :  worried about what is their future in India but the government says all the citizens are being treated
*27:54.340- 28:01.220* :  equally. Umbarassan Etirajan. Ecuador has become the second country in Latin America after Colombia
*28:01.220- 28:06.100* :  to decriminalize euthanasia despite strong opposition from the Roman Catholic Church.
*28:06.640- 28:12.080* :  Its constitutional court voted 72 in favor of allowing doctors to help terminally ill people
*28:12.080- 28:18.000* :  end their own lives. The lawsuit was brought by a woman who said she was experiencing pain, loneliness
*28:18.000- 28:23.240* :  and cruelty as a result of neurological disease. With the help of the translator,
*28:23.240- 28:29.560* :  her lawyer Pablo Encalada Hidalgo explained the legal criteria that will apply to patients.
*28:32.460- 28:37.520* :  So the first legal requirement for this to happen is that there has to be an explicit
*28:38.220- 28:45.360* :  will that has to be declared by either the client or the legal representative that the client
*28:45.360- 28:53.700* :  or the patient has. The second one would be that she has to be suffering really from pain
*28:54.640- 29:03.980* :  due to the anileness that it's basically incurable. And finally the medical process has to be
*29:03.980- 29:14.060* :  taken care of from a formal and legal medical thing. We knew the debate and especially the legal
*29:14.060- 29:20.820* :  debate and the moral debate in the country was going to be really tough. This is what happens.
*29:20.840- 29:29.400* :  Sin embargo. Yet the support that we got was from a majority of the public opinion and this was
*29:29.400- 29:36.400* :  certainly unexpected. In times of polarization and extremist rhetoric, Latin America has taken
*29:36.400- 29:42.680* :  steps towards greater freedom of rights which is something that it's important it's commendable
*29:42.680- 29:47.980* :  and should be recognized in the process. Lawyer Pablo Encalada Hidalgo.
*29:49.080- 29:54.000* :  It was two broken fingers in a rugby match that changed everything for Seiji Ozawa,
*29:54.180- 30:00.400* :  the celebrated Japanese conductor. He had hoped to become a pianist until that injury put an end
*30:00.400- 30:08.020* :  to his dream. Instead Mr Ozawa, who has now died at the age of 88, went on to lead world renowned
*30:08.020- 30:11.680* :  orchestras. Vincent Dowd looks back at his career.
*30:24.640- 30:30.220* :  Seiji Ozawa became an admired interpreter of Marla, Schoenberg and Richard Strauss,
*30:30.480- 30:36.240* :  yet his origins could not have been further from those of other big conductors of his generation.
*30:36.300- 30:42.840* :  His career proved that great interpreters of western classical music needn't be from the west.
*30:42.840- 30:50.780* :  Ozawa was born to Japanese parents in occupied China in 1935. After World War II, back in Japan,
*30:50.780- 30:56.680* :  the teenage Ozawa studied piano until he broke two fingers playing rugby.
*30:57.320- 31:04.140* :  My piano teacher said, Seiji Ozawa, you don't think about conducting because all the
*31:04.140- 31:09.960* :  conductors came from Europe or from America. So I went the first time I live concert
*31:09.960- 31:19.300* :  on orchestra. I was 14. It was so impressive for me at the shop. Then that day on I want to study
*31:19.300- 31:25.820* :  conducting. Ozawa's ambition took him to a music festival in France where he was spotted and invited
*31:25.820- 31:31.820* :  to America. Then at Bernstein and in Berlin, Herbert von Karian admired his abilities.
*31:32.400- 31:38.440* :  In 1973, he took over the Boston Symphony Orchestra where he stayed for almost three decades.
*31:38.440- 31:43.960* :  He played with many other orchestras and recorded widely. At the beginning of his career,
*31:43.960- 31:50.860* :  some thought he rose too far, too fast, on limited repertoire. But eventually, Seiji Ozawa became
*31:50.860- 31:54.400* :  one of the most respected conductors of recent decades.
*31:58.800- 32:01.920* :  Vincent Dade with that look back at the life of Seiji Ozawa.
