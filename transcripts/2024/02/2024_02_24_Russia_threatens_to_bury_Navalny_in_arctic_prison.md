*01:23.800- 01:29.000* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Saturday the 24th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:29.800- 01:34.920* :  Alex Aitnavali's mother says Russian officials are threatening to bury his body in the Arctic
*01:34.920- 01:41.560* :  prison where he was held if she doesn't agree to a secret funeral. Poland gets $150 billion
*01:41.560- 01:48.320* :  off from the European Union, but will the cash actually arrive? And I see from behind the gates
*01:48.320- 01:54.740* :  that these emissated women with children come and the bodies were so thin. They were desperate.
*01:54.740- 02:00.680* :  I mean, they were just coming and streams. A new BBC radio series remembers the Bengal famine,
*02:01.220- 02:04.780* :  which killed three million people in India during World War II.
*02:07.900- 02:13.700* :  Also in this podcast, the US says Israel's plans to build new homes in the occupied West Bank
*02:13.700- 02:21.120* :  is inconsistent with international law. And why did a big star make such a big bang?
*02:21.120- 02:27.080* :  It's about 20 light years across a teaspoon of this material weighs about as much as Everest.
*02:31.100- 02:35.520* :  It is a grim choice. Alex Aitnavali's mother has apparently been told
*02:35.520- 02:41.400* :  she must agree to a private funeral for her son without any mourners or else the authorities
*02:41.400- 02:46.600* :  will bury him in the Arctic prison where he died. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has continued to deny
*02:46.600- 02:52.360* :  allegations that it was involved in Mr. Navalny's death. Reaction from the West, it says, has been
*02:52.360- 02:57.940* :  hysterical for Moscow, our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. According to a spokesperson
*02:57.940- 03:02.960* :  for Alex Aitnavali's family, a Russian investigator called Mr. Navalny's mother,
*03:02.960- 03:09.640* :  Ludmila, and delivered an ultimatum. Either she agrees within three hours for her son to be
*03:09.640- 03:15.920* :  later rest without a public funeral, or he would be buried in the remote penal colony where he
*03:15.920- 03:22.800* :  died a week ago. The spokesperson added that Ludmila Navalny had refused to negotiate. Instead,
*03:22.800- 03:27.280* :  she had demanded her son's body be handed over in accordance with Russian law,
*03:27.280- 03:33.220* :  insisting that investigators were obliged to do so within two days of cause of death being
*03:33.220- 03:38.600* :  established. Ludmila Navalny said yesterday that she had been presented with and signed.
*03:38.600- 03:44.540* :  Alex Aitnavali's medical death certificate. It reportedly claims that Russia's most prominent
*03:44.540- 03:50.680* :  opposition leader died of natural causes. But his widow, Julia, has accused Vladimir Putin
*03:50.680- 03:56.740* :  of killing her husband. The Kremlin has described accusations that the president is responsible
*03:56.800- 04:00.460* :  for Mr. Navalny's death, obnoxious and unacceptable.
*04:01.320- 04:07.160* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. This rail comes just as Ukraine marks two years since the Russian invasion.
*04:07.720- 04:11.700* :  Friday saw dozens of foreign ministers gathered at the United Nations headquarters
*04:12.360- 04:17.760* :  to discuss a path for Ukraine. Some Western leaders urged allies not to tire in their support for
*04:17.760- 04:23.660* :  Kiev, just hours after the U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled more sanctions aimed at damaging
*04:23.660- 04:28.740* :  Moscow's ability to wage war. Remember, the United States pulled together a coalition of more than
*04:28.740- 04:33.460* :  50 nations to support Ukraine. That's why I'm announcing more than 500 new sanctions.
*04:41.560- 04:46.700* :  And response to Putin brutal war of conquest in response to Alexei Navalny's death.
*04:47.020- 04:51.560* :  President Biden, we're watching that session at the UN with our correspondent to New York,
*04:51.560- 04:57.640* :  Nedditor Feeck, who sent this report. Ukraine's allies were eager to show their unwavering support
*04:57.640- 05:03.340* :  as peace remains a distant prospect. More than 50 foreign ministers and ambassadors mainly
*05:03.340- 05:08.660* :  from the West gathered before the UN Security Council debate and flanked the Ukrainian foreign
*05:08.660- 05:14.960* :  minister Demitro Kuleba as he read out a joint statement. It condemned Russia's invasion as a
*05:14.960- 05:20.500* :  flagrant violation of international law and urged countries not to provide weapons to Russia's
*05:20.500- 05:26.040* :  military. What some have referred to as Ukraine fatigue has set in amongst nations of the global
*05:26.040- 05:31.680* :  south, and multiple other global crises, including the war in Gaza, have diverted attention
*05:31.680- 05:38.260* :  away from Moscow's invasion. Inside the chamber, Mr. Kuleba appealed for international solidarity.
*05:38.900- 05:44.980* :  Moscow hopes that the world will deplete its empathy towards Ukrainians if Ukrainians are killed
*05:44.980- 05:53.660* :  every single day for two many days in a row. We shall not allow this to happen. We will
*05:53.660- 05:59.580* :  rally the world behind our true cause even more. Russian terror only strengthens our resilience
*05:59.580- 06:05.220* :  in commitment. Russia's ambassador Vaseline Abenzia, along with its ally China, criticized
*06:05.220- 06:11.860* :  Nedditor's expansion towards Russia's borders. Western leaders fooled us during the years of
*06:11.860- 06:17.720* :  the Cold War and want to continue to fool us now. They consider the rights of Nedditor to
*06:17.720- 06:26.260* :  continue to expand as an absolute right and transforming any corner of the world into
*06:26.260- 06:31.060* :  the area of responsibility of the Alliance. Due to Russia's veto power, the international
*06:31.060- 06:37.220* :  body has been blocked from addressing the conflict. However, the UK and the US have imposed unilateral
*06:37.220- 06:42.920* :  sanctions against Russia, the latest of which target the country's defense industry and financial
*06:43.020- 06:48.780* :  sector. There's nothing quite like sniffing around for a bit of spare cash,
*06:49.280- 06:53.820* :  and then having your pockets suddenly filled with gold. But that's pretty much what's happened
*06:53.820- 07:00.120* :  to Poland, which has been offered about $150 billion worth of extra spending money by the European
*07:00.120- 07:05.340* :  Union. The money was blocked when the previous Polish government of the Law and Justice Party
*07:05.340- 07:11.540* :  was accused of politicising the law, which was deemed to be in breach of EU rules. But the
*07:11.540- 07:16.360* :  new Prime Minister, Donald Tusk's administration, has laid out a plan to make the judiciary
*07:16.360- 07:20.860* :  properly independent, a move that got the thumbs up from the head of the European Commission,
*07:20.860- 07:27.300* :  Ursula von der Leyen. We are impressed by your efforts and those of the Polish people
*07:27.300- 07:34.980* :  to restore the rule of law as the backbone of your society. Together, we will protect the rule
*07:34.980- 07:39.800* :  of law all over Europe. Standing beside me is von der Leyen, the Polish Prime Minister,
*07:39.800- 07:44.620* :  Donald Tusk, made it pretty clear that as far as he was concerned, the only reason this money
*07:44.620- 07:50.460* :  was coming Poland's way was because his government had come to power after the election last October.
*07:52.360- 07:58.240* :  We have it. This is a very important day. We have worked a lot together,
*07:58.240- 08:04.580* :  especially poles on October the 15th, choosing democracy and the rule of law. This really is a
*08:04.580- 08:09.620* :  mountain of money that we will use well, and that we will also use to relieve everything
*08:09.620- 08:16.380* :  that is currently causing such tension and anxiety. Donald Tusk, I asked our Europe Regional
*08:16.380- 08:21.360* :  Editor, Danny Eberhardt, whether this was now a done deal. Well, you would have thought that
*08:21.360- 08:26.560* :  from the gushing press conference there, Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Tusk come from the same
*08:26.560- 08:32.640* :  European political group, the centre-right EPP. They also know each other well, but even so,
*08:32.640- 08:37.620* :  he's only been in power for just over two months, so it's amazing how quick this has shifted.
*08:37.620- 08:43.000* :  It was one of his main priorities to entirely reset relations with Brussels and restore the
*08:43.000- 08:47.820* :  rule of law in Poland after eight years of law and justice government. The difficulty is that
*08:47.840- 08:52.560* :  there's this road map, but the problem is, Donald Tusk doesn't control all the parts of government,
*08:52.560- 08:59.440* :  so the president is a law and justice party ally on J. Duda, and it's possible that he could veto
*08:59.440- 09:05.060* :  some of the measures that they plan to put into place, and also the constitutional court has a
*09:05.300- 09:10.320* :  majority of pro-law and justice judges there, people that they are pointed, so that's another
*09:10.320- 09:14.920* :  potential stumbling block. There were very pointed choices of words there by Ursula von der Leyen,
*09:14.920- 09:19.780* :  talked about protecting the rule of law all over Europe. She's got a particular country in mind,
*09:19.780- 09:24.400* :  hasn't she? She certainly does. It's the other main transgressor as far as Brussels concerned,
*09:24.400- 09:30.160* :  which is Hungary, but the situation with Hungary is very different. Victor Orban was re-elected
*09:30.160- 09:35.420* :  to a fourth term only last year, so he's very solidly in power there, so he has a different,
*09:35.420- 09:40.900* :  but related dispute on rule of law, and the EU commission is withholding billions of dollars of
*09:40.900- 09:47.300* :  funds still. It's released some in December when there was a council about Ukraine, but he is showing
*09:47.300- 09:52.780* :  no signs of changing on that level. Also interesting words used by Donald Tusk, he said Poland would use
*09:52.780- 09:58.740* :  the money to relieve the things causing tension and anxiety. What do that mean? Well, one of those
*09:58.740- 10:03.700* :  is the farming dispute that's going on in Poland in terms of blockading the Ukrainian border,
*10:03.700- 10:08.900* :  because Polish farmers are upset among other things with cheap Ukrainian grain coming into Poland,
*10:08.900- 10:14.220* :  but there are other issues too, so although money is going to go to farmers, there's also things
*10:14.220- 10:18.480* :  about the green transition, so some of these funds will help Poland, which is very heavily
*10:18.480- 10:22.800* :  dependent on fossil fuels to ease workers' concerns in that sector.
*10:23.080- 10:28.680* :  Danny Aberhardt, it's not often the United States criticises Israel, perhaps a little more
*10:28.680- 10:34.440* :  common than it was, but still it says something that the Secretary of State has said that Israel's
*10:34.440- 10:40.960* :  settlements in the West Bank are inconsistent with international law, which sounds like a roundabout
*10:40.960- 10:45.880* :  way of saying they're illegal. Most countries already hold that view, but under the presidency of
*10:45.880- 10:51.360* :  Donald Trump, it wasn't so in America. From Washington, here's our State Department correspondent,
*10:51.360- 10:56.500* :  Tom Bateman. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken described Israeli settlement building in the
*10:56.500- 11:02.760* :  Occupy West Bank as inconsistent with international law. The statement brings the US back in line with
*11:02.760- 11:07.120* :  most of the international community, which sees the transfer of any country's civilians to
*11:07.120- 11:12.600* :  occupy territory as illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention. It finally overturns a move made
*11:12.600- 11:18.360* :  in 2019 by the Trump administration, which was welcomed by Israel when then Secretary of State Mike
*11:18.360- 11:23.640* :  Pompeo announced that Washington no longer viewed settlements as a breach of international law.
*11:24.240- 11:29.520* :  Mr Pompeo later became the first serving Secretary of State to make an official visit to a West
*11:29.520- 11:34.740* :  Bank settlement where he has a brand of wine named after him. Mr Blinken added that he was
*11:34.740- 11:40.220* :  disappointed by Israel's announcement on Thursday of plans to build more than 2,000 new housing
*11:40.220- 11:44.740* :  units in the West Bank. The country's government said it was doing that in response to a Palestinian
*11:44.740- 11:50.360* :  gun attack close to a settlement which killed an Israeli man and left 10 wounded. Tom Bateman,
*11:51.600- 11:58.720* :  once upon a time in a galaxy not so far away, there was an explosion. One so big that by 1987,
*11:58.720- 12:03.740* :  people here on Earth could see it with an naked eye, but despite being what you might call a
*12:04.020- 12:11.060* :  high-vis cosmic event, nobody could work out what caused it. Until now, this latter day big bang
*12:11.060- 12:17.020* :  was it seems a star, effectively blowing itself to pieces, and not just any star, but a so-called
*12:17.020- 12:24.580* :  blue giant, which has been given the catchy name SN1978A. What remained afterwards was something
*12:24.580- 12:30.600* :  even more remarkable, a neutron star. That's an object so dense that a single teaspoon would
*12:30.600- 12:36.620* :  weigh 10 million tons. Dr Olivia Jones from the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh was one of those
*12:36.620- 12:43.160* :  who uncovered the mystery. She told the BBC's Roland Peas, why a single star's death had such
*12:43.160- 12:49.360* :  extraordinary consequences. Really massive stars, like SN1987A or what it was beforehand,
*12:49.360- 12:55.160* :  was about 20 times the mass of a sun. If you think of us as a tennis ball in size, the star that
*12:55.160- 13:00.520* :  formed the H7A was as big as a London eye. The pressure and density right in the centre of that
*13:00.540- 13:06.600* :  star is phenomenal, so it creates this really, really compact core, a teaspoon of this material
*13:06.600- 13:11.380* :  of a neutron star weighs about as much as Everest. And the fact that you can see it when it first
*13:11.380- 13:16.180* :  exploded with the naked eye is unprecedented for such an object in another galaxy like this.
*13:16.680- 13:20.860* :  We've been able to see how it evolves in real time, which in astronomy terms is extremely rare,
*13:20.860- 13:25.980* :  just tracing the evolution of the death of a star. What you see initially is the actual
*13:25.980- 13:31.080* :  explosion of the star itself right in the centre. Then we had a period of about 10 years where you
*13:31.080- 13:35.860* :  couldn't actually see very much in the centre, you needed these new telescopes like Web and JWST
*13:35.860- 13:41.260* :  to see the mechanics of the explosion and then key to this is what was left behind. And we've
*13:41.260- 13:46.020* :  been searching for that holy grail, has a neutron star formed or has a black hole been left behind.
*13:46.580- 13:52.000* :  The wonderful thing about the web telescope, you can see at high resolution both the ring,
*13:52.000- 13:56.040* :  the outer debris of the star and the right in the very centre where the explosion was.
*13:56.260- 14:01.000* :  So what we see where the star was and where it exploded was argon and sulphur.
*14:01.320- 14:05.620* :  And we know that these needed an awful lot of energy and the only thing that could be doing this
*14:05.700- 14:09.960* :  is a neutron star. So this is basically an extraordinarily hot nuclear
*14:09.980- 14:14.820* :  ember that's sitting in the middle. Yes, right in the middle. And you can see this because
*14:15.240- 14:21.480* :  Supernova1987A is about 20 light years across in total. And we can isolate the core where
*14:21.480- 14:26.500* :  the explosion was from the rest of the debris in this nearby galaxy, which I think is fantastic.
*14:26.720- 14:32.780* :  Do you know how hot the surface of this star is and is it just the intensity x-ray heat that's
*14:32.780- 14:37.140* :  coming off that's causing all this radiation that you're seeing? I hope you're ready for a very
*14:37.140- 14:43.620* :  big number. The neutron star is over a million degrees Celsius. Scientists, Olivia Jones talking
*14:43.620- 14:47.840* :  to Roland Pies and you can hear more of that interview on this week's Science and Action program
*14:47.840- 14:55.220* :  here on the BBC World Service. Still to come on the global news podcast. China has asked
*14:55.360- 15:00.200* :  two decades or so really a hotspot for fossils of different time periods, including the one we're
*15:00.200- 15:04.120* :  talking about today, the Triassic, really astounding fossils are coming out of China.
*15:04.520- 15:10.440* :  The remarkable discovery of a five meter long ancient aquatic creature known as the terrible
*15:19.420- 15:23.860* :  headed reptile. It's quite a fall from grace. Seven years ago, Sebastian Kurtz was being
*15:23.860- 15:29.520* :  fated as the youngest ever Chancellor in Austria's history. Indeed, he was for a while the youngest
*15:29.520- 15:34.920* :  head of state in the world. But Friday saw the former Chancellor given an eight month suspended
*15:34.920- 15:40.520* :  prison sentence for perjury. This revolves around testimony he gave to a parliamentary committee.
*15:40.520- 15:46.580* :  Mr Kurtz intends to appeal. He denies any wrongdoing as Bethany Bell reports from Vienna.
*15:47.240- 15:53.520* :  Mr Kurtz was once hailed as a rising star among European conservatives before he left politics
*15:53.520- 16:00.400* :  in 2021. But this ruling deals a blow to any chances he might have had of launching a political
*16:00.400- 16:06.460* :  comeback. The court ruled that Mr Kurtz had given full statements to a parliamentary committee
*16:06.460- 16:13.160* :  investigating corruption in 2020. In a separate case, Mr Kurtz is still under investigation
*16:13.260- 16:19.220* :  for allegedly spending public money for favorable media coverage, something he denies.
*16:19.760- 16:23.080* :  He's not been charged in that case. Bethany Bell
*16:24.180- 16:30.180* :  When is a Muslim, not a Muslim? That's a very contentious issue in Pakistan, where some
*16:30.180- 16:35.760* :  denominations consider others not to be the real thing. One group that's been particularly shunned
*16:35.760- 16:40.780* :  and his face continued persecution is the Ahmedisect. Their mosques have been bombed,
*16:41.180- 16:46.240* :  congregations sprayed with automatic weapons because Islamist militants regard the Ahmedis
*16:46.240- 16:52.100* :  faith as blasphemous. But a recent court judgment has provoked protest because the judge ruled
*16:52.100- 16:56.620* :  that Ahmedis should be free to practice their faith. South Asia, regional editor and
*16:56.620- 17:02.920* :  barrison ethe rajan told me more. A man from the Ahmedisect was accused of disseminating a
*17:02.920- 17:08.780* :  forbidden text, that is Ahmeditex, because the Ahmedis are not considered as part of Islam
*17:08.780- 17:13.940* :  mainstream Muslims by the hardliners. Now, when it went to the court after spending several
*17:13.940- 17:20.600* :  months in jail, what the judge found was reading this script was made illegal only in 2021,
*17:20.700- 17:27.200* :  but he was accused of reading this in 2019. And during that ruling, the Supreme Court Chief Justice
*17:27.380- 17:33.260* :  Casifies Issa also made several comments about how to respect once religion and what are the
*17:33.260- 17:38.980* :  fundamental tenets of Islam. Now, Islamists in the country were angry saying that he was accused
*17:39.100- 17:46.260* :  of blasphemy because Ahmedis are not considered as Muslims by the hardliners. So releasing him from
*17:46.260- 17:51.780* :  prison was strongly criticized by various groups, and that is why they were also showing their
*17:51.780- 17:57.860* :  anger against the Chief Justice. The ruling came about two weeks ago, but it slowly started in a
*17:57.860- 18:03.780* :  social media discussion. Now, it has become a protest movement, thousands of people protesting in
*18:03.780- 18:09.560* :  the city of Peshawar, and then several hardliners groups expressing their anger against the Chief
*18:09.560- 18:15.920* :  Justice and the system. There have been previous cases in Pakistan where high-profile legal figures
*18:15.920- 18:22.160* :  have made rulings or defended causes which others considered blasphemous, and those legal figures
*18:22.160- 18:27.380* :  have ended up being murdered, so presumably the judges here ought to be rather nervous.
*18:28.260- 18:32.620* :  That's a concern for the legal community now, and that is why the Supreme Court had to
*18:32.620- 18:38.240* :  issue a statement yesterday clarifying that it was not against Islam, it was not blasphemy,
*18:38.240- 18:42.000* :  it was based on the rule of law. But not everyone's going to believe that, are they?
*18:42.160- 18:47.780* :  And that is the discussion on social media was, you know, more stronger. Blasphemy is a very
*18:47.780- 18:53.780* :  sensitive issue in Pakistan, and over the years a number of people from this particular Ahmadisect
*18:54.220- 19:00.240* :  they were attacked, they were killed on accusations of insulting Islam. Even though it is punishable
*19:00.240- 19:06.380* :  by death, no one has been executed by law in Pakistan, for blasphemous charges. But the angry
*19:06.380- 19:11.920* :  Islamists can run into your house, there have been bomb blasts and gun attacks, people lynched
*19:11.920- 19:16.600* :  to death, these things have happened, and this is what terrifies many people, especially when it comes
*19:16.600- 19:20.580* :  to issues related to blasphemy. Ambarasan Etharajan
*19:21.640- 19:26.600* :  Three million, that's the number, thought we've died in the Bengal famine in the middle of the
*19:26.600- 19:31.780* :  Second World War in British India. It's one of the largest losses of civilian life on the Allied
*19:31.780- 19:37.700* :  side. Yet there is no memorial, no museum, not even a plaque anywhere in the world to those who
*19:37.700- 19:44.340* :  died. Pathamitta was a boy living in Calcutta at the time. I see from behind the gates that these
*19:44.340- 19:50.740* :  emaciated women with children would come, the bodies, you know, were so thin, they were desperate,
*19:50.740- 19:55.420* :  I mean they're just coming and streams. Do you remember what they were asking for?
*19:55.800- 20:02.620* :  Oh yes, in Bengal it's an active pan them are. Mother gave me a little bit of that watery bit of
*20:02.620- 20:06.860* :  the rice. They were not even asking for rice, they were asking for the drink. They can't,
*20:06.860- 20:12.360* :  yeah, because they're so desperate, they thought that people wouldn't have the rice even to
*20:12.360- 20:17.880* :  give them. That three million figure for the number of deaths also gives a title to a new BBC
*20:17.880- 20:23.120* :  radio series which pieces together the story of the Bengal famine through first hand accounts.
*20:23.120- 20:29.720* :  Three million is produced by Kavita Puri and it Robinson asked her first how the famine happened.
*20:30.340- 20:38.380* :  It's complex and hugely contested, but the context is the Second World War. Burma had fallen
*20:38.380- 20:44.680* :  in early 1942 and the rice supply had ceased coming into Bengal and it's kind of little known,
*20:44.680- 20:51.000* :  but in Calcutta there were hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers stationed there going to and
*20:51.000- 20:56.200* :  from the Asian front and they all needed to be fed and the colonial government was printing money
*20:56.200- 21:02.820* :  to pay for the wartime resources and inflation was rife and rice, the staple food was kind of
*21:02.820- 21:08.580* :  unaffordable for millions of people and for those living in the Bengal Delta their boats,
*21:08.600- 21:14.700* :  their food had been taken away by the colonial authorities because they feared that there would
*21:14.700- 21:19.140* :  be a Japanese invasion. It's seen how they progressed across Southeast Asia taking local
*21:19.140- 21:24.720* :  resources and so that caused huge problems for all the already fragile economy and then there was
*21:24.720- 21:31.300* :  this devastating cyclone in the end of 1942. So all these causes and then there is the question
*21:31.300- 21:37.260* :  of Winston Churchill. And one of the reasons sometimes this issue is not addressed is the huge
*21:37.260- 21:41.700* :  controversy. On the one hand some people suggesting Churchill should be regarded as a war criminal.
*21:41.900- 21:46.340* :  On the other people saying it's a disgraceful slur on Britain's wartime leader.
*21:46.840- 21:50.600* :  Does this programme try to answer that question? Are you just hearing the voices of people?
*21:50.640- 21:56.780* :  I think from my perspective it's a really valid question to ask that but it's hugely and hotly
*21:56.780- 22:04.060* :  debated and I think it is obscured this huge number, this 3 million people. I mean it's one of
*22:04.060- 22:08.620* :  the largest losses of civilian life and I think that's what I wanted to excavate with these
*22:08.620- 22:13.160* :  eyewitness accounts and the survivor accounts that have never been recorded. It must have been
*22:13.160- 22:18.040* :  terribly difficult to find. It was so difficult to find because it's 80 years on and as you know that
*22:18.040- 22:23.840* :  war generation is kind of slipping away from us before our eyes and there are not that many people
*22:23.840- 22:28.960* :  who can recount that but there are people still living in our country like Parthite. The oldest
*22:28.960- 22:35.560* :  person I interviewed was 97 and she had such clarity when she remembered that time. It was very
*22:35.560- 22:40.420* :  disturbing what she remembered. She remembered dead bodies, vultures on the streets of Calcutta.
*22:40.420- 22:47.500* :  I watched her shudder as she recalled the smell and you don't forget those memories 80 years on
*22:47.500- 22:53.220* :  and the survivors too. No one's asked them. Why found one man in Bengal who's trying to collect
*22:53.220- 22:58.760* :  those testimonies and he says when he approaches them they burst into tears and say why have you come so late?
*22:59.480- 23:05.340* :  Cavitapuri speaking to Nick Robinson at all episodes of 3 million are available on BBC Sounds
*23:05.340- 23:13.720* :  Now. The first episode will be broadcast this Sunday at 1330 GMT. Now when a black Texan boy Darryl
*23:13.720- 23:18.840* :  George turned up for school with dreadlocks he was punished. He took his case to court though
*23:19.200- 23:24.440* :  but now a judge has ruled that this did not count as discrimination. In other words schools could
*23:24.440- 23:30.060* :  punish children for their dreadlocks. The decision was met with sighs and gasps by many of those
*23:30.060- 23:35.760* :  gathered in the courthouse which included Darryl, his supporters and advocates for what they consider
*23:35.760- 23:41.440* :  to be natural hair. The BBC's Brandon Drennan in Washington has been covering the story. James
*23:41.440- 23:48.840* :  Reynolds asked him to describe Darryl's hairstyle. His hair is in dreadlocks. They're tied and twisted
*23:49.220- 23:54.980* :  together. The locked chunks of hair are almost braided together sitting tightly and neatly on top of
*23:54.980- 24:00.500* :  his head. I'm seeing a picture of him outside the court and his hair is done up. It doesn't touch
*24:00.500- 24:06.240* :  the collar at all but how does that break the rules? So in all the photos like you've just mentioned
*24:06.240- 24:13.420* :  that I've seen I've never seen his hair fall below his earlobes or to the shirt collar. The school
*24:13.420- 24:18.780* :  district's dress code states that the student's hair cannot touch the shirt collar or reach that
*24:18.780- 24:25.060* :  length nor can it be worn in a style that would allow the hair to reach that length if it was
*24:25.060- 24:31.220* :  unraveled. So even though we've never seen him in photos where his hair is longer than the limit,
*24:31.760- 24:36.880* :  the fact that it could be longer than the limit if he were to let it down is in violation of the
*24:36.880- 24:42.000* :  district's dress code. What did he and his lawyers and supporters tell the court? George and his
*24:42.040- 24:48.600* :  mom both cried after the judges ruling. He said that all of this over my hair he's been in
*24:48.600- 24:54.540* :  school suspension and out of a normal classroom setting over this since August and so he feels
*24:55.280- 25:00.180* :  his education is being compromised over something trivial and that he's being discriminated against
*25:00.180- 25:06.440* :  because of a cultural hairstyle. And in some schools across the world kids are told to cut their hair.
*25:06.740- 25:10.880* :  When he was told to cut his hair or face the prospect of not attending lessons,
*25:10.940- 25:16.660* :  how do you explain the importance of not cutting his hair to the court? He said that one of the reasons
*25:16.660- 25:21.840* :  for refusing to cut his hair is because of its cultural significance. He said it's how I feel
*25:21.840- 25:27.140* :  closer to my ancestors. So particularly I think what I've seen when it comes to African Americans
*25:27.140- 25:33.140* :  in their house dials, regulations and policies aimed at reducing or minimizing or eliminating them
*25:33.140- 25:38.500* :  make them feel other less welcomed and so this just was an uncomfortable feeling and he wanted to
*25:38.500- 25:43.380* :  stand his ground against what he perceived as discrimination. Brandon you report from you know
*25:43.380- 25:48.140* :  his states tell us about dress codes and hair codes as they've affected people that you know.
*25:48.660- 25:54.500* :  It's not uncommon for this scenario similar to this to present itself a conversation I've had even
*25:54.500- 25:59.940* :  with family members who have natural hair you know should I cut my hair should I cut my dreadlocks
*25:59.940- 26:05.680* :  to pursue a professional career or will I be received as less capable because I'm going to be
*26:05.680- 26:10.820* :  stereotyped in a certain way so certainly even if there isn't an outright policy saying you have
*26:10.820- 26:16.100* :  to wear your hair a certain way black Americans in particular are very aware of the stereotypes
*26:16.100- 26:21.040* :  that surround these natural hairstyles. Brandon Drennan speaking to James Reynolds,
*26:21.760- 26:27.700* :  an ear complete fossil that scientists described as dragon-like has been discovered in China the
*26:27.700- 26:35.520* :  previously unidentified five meter long aquatic reptile is 240 million years old and predates
*26:35.520- 26:40.860* :  the dinosaurs and it is appropriate that it's been described as dragon-like having been
*26:40.860- 26:46.520* :  unearthed in a country with a rich mythology about dragons. Stephen Speakman from Stuttgart State
*26:46.520- 26:51.740* :  Museum of Natural History in Germany worked on the fossil and described it to Paul Henley.
*26:52.360- 26:57.200* :  So this animal is very remarkable because it has an extremely long neck but also a very
*26:57.200- 27:03.400* :  elongate and snake-like body quite a long tail and its limbs were very flipper-like like you
*27:03.400- 27:08.040* :  can see in the sea turtles today. So it was an animal that was really quite well adapted to
*27:08.040- 27:14.180* :  aquatic life and with a very elongate and snake-like body overall. It lived in the water all the time
*27:14.180- 27:18.640* :  did it? We think so yes there has actually been a previous study on one of these animals that
*27:18.640- 27:23.980* :  showed that it actually had an embryo in its abdominal region suggesting that these animals even
*27:23.980- 27:28.680* :  gave birth to life young rather than laying eggs which meant they did not have to go back on
*27:28.680- 27:35.520* :  to land to lay eggs. Its name I read means terrible-headed reptile which is fairly scary it's not a
*27:35.520- 27:40.460* :  dinosaur though. No it's not a dinosaur and actually the reason why it's called terrible-headed
*27:40.460- 27:46.160* :  lizard or reptiles actually a funny one because when this animal was first described in 2003 it was
*27:46.160- 27:51.400* :  described just on the basis of a single skull but now that we know the complete animal and see it's
*27:51.400- 27:56.000* :  very bizarre and snake-like body you can actually say that the skulls are almost at least terrifying
*27:56.000- 28:01.920* :  thing about this animal. Now it was unearthed in China you've worked on this fossil even though
*28:01.920- 28:06.860* :  it's still in China. How did the access work? Is this an international thing? Yes this is very
*28:06.860- 28:11.500* :  much an international work. I'm the first author on this but it was very much a collaborative
*28:11.500- 28:17.020* :  project with Chinese colleagues involved so the specimens were located in the museum in Beijing
*28:17.100- 28:22.720* :  and also one in Beijing. These colleagues from China they invited me as well as some of my co-authors
*28:22.720- 28:27.640* :  onto this project for expertise on these animals. You mentioned there are lots of new discoveries
*28:27.640- 28:34.400* :  of this kind made in China these days. Yes China is really since the last two decades or so really a
*28:34.400- 28:38.980* :  hotspot for fossils of different time periods including the one we're talking about today the
*28:38.980- 28:44.520* :  Triassic. It's really astounding fossils are coming out of China. Stephen Speakman speaking to
*28:44.520- 28:51.380* :  Paul Henley about the terrible headed reptile. Your revision is seen by some as a bit of a laugh
*28:51.380- 28:56.920* :  release that's the idea but the world's biggest live music contest looks set to be immersed in
*28:56.920- 29:02.960* :  political machinations once again. Protesters had already objected to Israel taking part in the wake
*29:02.960- 29:09.020* :  of the conflict in Gaza but now it's been alleged that Israel's entry refers to the Hamas attacks
*29:09.020- 29:14.860* :  which triggered that conflict. This in a competition where politics is supposed to be a no-no
*29:15.220- 29:20.180* :  and music correspondent Mark Savage reports on what looks like becoming another unwelcome
*29:20.180- 29:32.000* :  sideshow to the main event in May. This is Eddon Golan who is hoping to represent Israel
*29:32.000- 29:38.920* :  at the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden this May. She was selected after winning the TV talent show
*29:38.920- 29:46.860* :  Rising Star earlier this month. At the time she dedicated her performance to the families waiting
*29:46.860- 29:53.220* :  for their loved ones to return from the war in Gaza. The lyrics for Israel's song October Rain
*29:53.220- 29:59.320* :  were published earlier this week and they appear to refer to the victims of the Hamas attacks on
*29:59.320- 30:05.240* :  October the 7th last year. At the end of the song Golan sings in Hebrew they were all good
*30:05.240- 30:11.700* :  children each one of them. Under Eurovision rules countries cannot perform songs that contain
*30:11.700- 30:18.380* :  political messages and the EBU which organizes the contest says it is currently examining Israel's
*30:18.380- 30:23.520* :  lyrics. The country's culture minister Miki Zohar has called the scrutiny out radius.
*30:25.280- 30:30.620* :  The song is very emotional there's no political character this is a song which expresses people's
*30:30.620- 30:36.300* :  feelings and the sorrow we've experienced. Eurovision organizers stress that they examine the lyrics
*30:36.300- 30:46.060* :  of every song submitted to the contest. In 2009 they rejected George's entry a satirical disco
*30:46.060- 30:51.560* :  anthem called We Don't Want to Put In for its references to the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
*30:55.360- 31:01.360* :  In 2021 Belarus withdrew from the competition after two of its songs were disqualified on political
*31:01.360- 31:11.900* :  grounds. But other countries have got away with political references. In 2016 the Ukrainian
*31:11.900- 31:17.080* :  singer Jamala entered with a song that referred to Russia's forced deportation of Crimean
*31:17.080- 31:28.600* :  Tatars in 1944. It was widely perceived as an allegory for Russian aggression towards modern
*31:28.600- 31:35.300* :  day Ukraine but the EBU allowed Jamala to continue in the competition and she ended up winning.
*31:39.460- 31:43.120* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*31:43.120- 31:49.420* :  later. This edition was made by Gabriel O'Reagan and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is
