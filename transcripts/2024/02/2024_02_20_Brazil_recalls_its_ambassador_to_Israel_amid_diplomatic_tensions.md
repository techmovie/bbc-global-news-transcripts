*01:43.680- 01:48.000* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 20th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:48.360- 01:53.520* :  Brazil is recalling its ambassador to Israel in an escalating route prompted by President
*01:53.520- 01:59.420* :  Lula De Silva comparing the Israeli assault on Gaza to Hitler's extermination of the Jews.
*02:00.380- 02:04.960* :  Relatives of the late Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, have been told that his body will
*02:04.960- 02:10.720* :  not be released for another two weeks to allow time for further tests. Nigeria's currency,
*02:10.720- 02:17.080* :  the Naira, has fallen to record lows against the US dollar as protests take place over rising prices.
*02:20.260- 02:27.360* :  Also in this podcast, in the case of the Mayhua Hakananaya is one of the most important
*02:27.360- 02:30.780* :  ones. It's also because it's our symbol in this island.
*02:31.380- 02:36.940* :  A campaign is growing for two of the famous East Island statues to be returned to the Polynesian
*02:36.940- 02:42.220* :  territory after they were removed in the 19th century and taken to the British Museum in London.
*02:46.640- 02:49.540* :  Brazil has recalled its ambassador to Tel Aviv,
*02:49.540- 02:56.220* :  Fredricomaya, in an escalating diplomatic route following President Luis Inacio Lula De Silva's
*02:56.220- 03:02.220* :  controversial comments about the Israeli action in Gaza. On Sunday, he described the conflict as
*03:02.220- 03:07.860* :  a genocide, not a war, which could only be compared to adult Hitler's decision to exterminate
*03:07.860- 03:13.500* :  the Jews. Earlier on Monday, Israel effectively banned the Brazilian leader from visiting the country.
*03:13.500- 03:18.980* :  I spoke to our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem, and asked him for more on
*03:18.980- 03:23.520* :  what Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, said in response to Lula's remarks.
*03:23.520- 03:31.360* :  He, like every politician in the country, expressed absolute outrage and dismay at the comparison
*03:31.360- 03:38.260* :  that President Lula appeared to be making, comparing the death of 29,000 people in the Gaza
*03:38.260- 03:44.600* :  strip to the gassing of six million Jews during the Holocaust. I don't know if President Lula was
*03:45.220- 03:50.480* :  making a calculated remark, but if he wasn't, then he shouldn't be surprised at the reaction.
*03:51.200- 03:57.460* :  And the way it was played out today was pretty unusual. They didn't just summon the ambassador
*03:58.160- 04:04.940* :  for a reprimand behind closed doors. They did it at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial,
*04:04.940- 04:12.540* :  and they paraded the poor ambassador in front of the book of names. That is the vast collection of
*04:12.540- 04:18.360* :  six million names that forms the centerpiece of the Yad Vashem Memorial. You know, with the press
*04:18.360- 04:25.600* :  all there to record the ambassador's discomfort, they really wanted to drive home the sense of
*04:26.020- 04:30.820* :  disbelief and outrage in Israel that such a comparison could possibly be made.
*04:30.820- 04:36.120* :  President Lula, for his part, has now recalled the ambassador to Brazil for talks,
*04:36.120- 04:40.340* :  so we don't quite know where it goes from here. Yeah, it seems as though President Lula's
*04:40.340- 04:46.780* :  doubling down no intention of apologizing. Obviously he's going down extraordinarily badly with
*04:46.780- 04:52.640* :  Israelis. Well, yeah, I mean, this comes on the heels of the case brought to the International
*04:52.640- 04:59.640* :  Court of Justice by South Africa, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. So here we have another
*04:59.640- 05:06.520* :  large country, a member of the BRICS group, essentially summoning the specter of the Holocaust
*05:06.540- 05:13.560* :  using terms like genocide when describing the actions of Israel's military in the Gaza Strip.
*05:13.560- 05:19.480* :  This is something which is causing dismay in Israel, but also perhaps a sense that here we are
*05:19.480- 05:25.860* :  with significant countries and chunks of populations around the world all feeling somewhat the same
*05:25.860- 05:32.880* :  way about what Israel is doing in Gaza. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. On Sunday, the World Health
*05:32.880- 05:38.600* :  Organization said the biggest hospital in southern Gaza was no longer functioning after a raid
*05:38.600- 05:44.860* :  by Israeli forces. The head of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Ataram Ghebera Yesas, said its teams had not
*05:44.860- 05:50.400* :  been allowed to enter the NASA hospital in the city of Khan Yunus. It's thought about 200 patients
*05:50.400- 05:55.780* :  remained there with no power and not enough staff to treat them. To get an impression of the
*05:55.780- 06:01.400* :  situation for medics in Gaza, Owen Bennett Jones spoke to a doctor, Irfan Galaria, who recently
*06:01.400- 06:06.480* :  managed to work in a hospital in the territory. Born and raised in Michigan, in the US,
*06:06.480- 06:11.960* :  he's a plastic surgeon now based in Virginia. He's just been to Gaza for 10 days to try to help
*06:11.960- 06:16.980* :  the medics there. So, as he crossed into Gaza from Egypt, what were his first impressions?
*06:17.500- 06:23.000* :  Every where you looked, we saw tents, just a sea of tents. They were lining the streets,
*06:23.000- 06:29.160* :  even in the roundabout at intersections. Wherever there was empty space, there was a home and
*06:29.160- 06:35.300* :  attempt to make a home. Now, you went and worked for 10 days in the European Gaza hospital,
*06:35.300- 06:41.140* :  which is in Raffa, near the crossing point with Egypt. So, just tell us a bit about that work.
*06:41.140- 06:46.300* :  What did you do? What was it like? Yeah, I worked and lived in the European Gaza hospital
*06:46.300- 06:52.780* :  in the operating room. And that's on the border of Khan Yunus and Raffa. And I was literally sleeping
*06:52.780- 06:58.100* :  in my sleeping bag on the floor of the operating room pre-operative holding area, because there's
*06:58.100- 07:03.780* :  no other place to sleep. So, I worked alongside the only local plastic surgeon who was in the hospital.
*07:04.180- 07:10.220* :  He estimates that he alone was responsible for carrying for over maybe 300 of the thousand
*07:10.220- 07:16.120* :  patients in the hospital. And daily, he averaged about 20 to 30 surgeries a day. So, I was
*07:16.120- 07:21.100* :  able to assist him. And these patients were of two types. One were patients who had new injuries,
*07:21.100- 07:26.700* :  acute injuries from bomb blasts, machine gun fires, sniper fire. And there was a second subset
*07:26.700- 07:32.760* :  of patients who had previous injuries and who were being brought back for secondary procedures,
*07:32.760- 07:37.280* :  such as cleaning out wounds, removing additional shrapnel, trying to align a bone.
*07:37.840- 07:42.280* :  You talk about sniper fire. The whole point of sniper fire is meant to be very sort of targeted
*07:42.280- 07:48.880* :  and accurate. Who was getting hit by sniper fire? You know, one morning there was several
*07:48.880- 07:54.520* :  elementary-aged children who were brought to the emergency room, all with sniper shot wounds
*07:54.520- 08:00.060* :  to their heads. One of the doctors on her team, she was called to assist and was there to talk
*08:00.060- 08:05.660* :  to the parents to hear their stories. She personally cared for at least three of these children.
*08:06.420- 08:11.240* :  She tried to resuscitate them all, but they had died. And she remembers the first child that
*08:11.240- 08:17.040* :  she tried to assist very vividly. She was a girl around the age of six or seven, who had a single
*08:17.040- 08:22.380* :  small circular wound in her forehead. And her father was rushing and carrying her in while this
*08:22.380- 08:27.260* :  child was unconscious and reflexively vomiting. And he was crying. She's my only daughter. She's
*08:27.260- 08:32.200* :  my only daughter. And the parents shared these stories from this incident and they were all about
*08:32.200- 08:37.140* :  the same. You know, the story was about four kilometers away from the hospital, tanks and
*08:37.140- 08:42.380* :  occupational forces has withdrawn. And several of the families were then trying to return to their
*08:42.380- 08:47.380* :  homes. And as they approached snipers, open fire and shot several of them in the head.
*08:48.240- 08:54.740* :  And it was clear that these were Israeli snipers? That is the assumption based on the experience
*08:54.740- 09:01.280* :  that they had. These children all had single bullet-sized wounds or entry points in their head.
*09:01.280- 09:06.580* :  They had no other marks of shrapnel or nor other evidence of missile blasts.
*09:06.940- 09:13.940* :  And the Israelis say that these hospitals have been used by Hamas to shelter fighters and
*09:13.940- 09:18.180* :  to store weapons. Now you were in a hospital for 10 days. And I presume there were lots of
*09:18.180- 09:21.100* :  people from the public there. So you wouldn't really, yeah, taking shelters. You wouldn't really
*09:21.100- 09:28.300* :  know who everyone was. Did you see any weapons? No, I did not see any weapons. I did not see any
*09:28.300- 09:33.760* :  suspicious activity. There were no places in the hospital that were determined or deemed to be
*09:33.760- 09:42.640* :  off-limits for me. And so I did not have any suspicions or concerns of any military fighters,
*09:42.640- 09:48.800* :  terrorists or soldiers that were in the hospital. That's Dr. Irfan Galaria, one of the BBC tried
*09:48.800- 09:53.980* :  to get the Israeli government and the IDF to respond to some of the allegations made in that
*09:53.980- 09:57.200* :  interview, but they were unable to provide us with a spokesperson.
*09:58.240- 10:03.800* :  The latest official figures on Israel's economy reveal it's shrank by far more than expected
*10:03.800- 10:10.200* :  at the end of last year. The country's central Bureau of Statistics calculated using what's
*10:10.200- 10:17.360* :  known as the annualized basis. That activity or GDP dropped by 19% towards the end of 2023.
*10:17.360- 10:23.480* :  The equivalent of a fall of 5% between October and December. Our chief economics correspondent
*10:23.480- 10:29.760* :  Dashini David has this analysis. The Hamas attacks on October the 7th and the subsequent war in
*10:29.760- 10:35.480* :  Gaza appear to have dealt a blow to the Israeli economy almost as damaging as that scene at the
*10:35.480- 10:41.040* :  height of the COVID pandemic. If the pattern over the final three months of 2023 were replicated
*10:41.040- 10:46.840* :  over a year was known as an annualized measure, it would be equal to a fall in household spending
*10:46.840- 10:53.880* :  of more than 25% with spending on services more than harbing. Businesses for activity plummet
*10:53.880- 10:59.800* :  with construction almost grinding to a halt due to the call-up of reservists and falling numbers
*10:59.800- 11:05.540* :  of Palestinian workers. The only area of expansion was in government spending as defense
*11:05.540- 11:11.200* :  expenditures soared. In November, the Israeli central bank estimated that the economy could recover
*11:11.200- 11:17.280* :  and expand by 2% this year. But with the conflict more protracted than many first assumed,
*11:17.280- 11:23.540* :  other economists reckon it could continue to extract a heavy price with a further contraction
*11:23.540- 11:30.180* :  albeit less dramatic than over the last few months unless there's an escalation in hostilities.
*11:30.180- 11:37.360* :  Dashini David. Next to Russia and the spokeswoman for the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny
*11:37.720- 11:42.620* :  has said investigators will not release his body for another two weeks because they say further
*11:42.620- 11:49.740* :  tests need to be carried out. Kira Yamish wrote on social media that the investigators said an
*11:49.740- 11:56.200* :  unspecified chemical examination would be carried out. Earlier on Monday, Mr Navalny's widow,
*11:56.500- 12:01.900* :  Julia, accused the Russian authorities of holding onto his remains until the traces of what she
*12:01.900- 12:08.960* :  called Putin's latest novice shock had disappeared. She released a video online vowing to continue her
*12:08.960- 12:14.560* :  husband's fight for a free Russia. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg sent this report from Moscow.
*12:15.080- 12:20.860* :  For three days now, in a remote part of Northern Russia, she has been trying to recover her son's
*12:20.860- 12:27.520* :  body. But Alexei Navalny's mother was told that investigators won't release it. Mr Navalny's
*12:27.520- 12:33.620* :  spokesperson claimed the family had been informed a 14-day chemical examination of the body was
*12:33.620- 12:41.340* :  required. Alexei Navalny's family, his supporters and western leaders, accused the Kremlin of murdering
*12:41.340- 12:49.140* :  him. Today, President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov reacted angrily to that. He described
*12:49.140- 12:54.780* :  suggestions that the Russian leadership was behind Mr Navalny's death as obnoxious and completely
*12:55.520- 13:01.020* :  unacceptable. For the Russian opposition, the death of Alexei Navalny has left a huge void.
*13:02.060- 13:04.520* :  But could his widow be about to fill that?
*13:08.060- 13:15.660* :  In a video statement, recorded abroad, Julia Navalny, bitter, angry, accused President Putin of
*13:15.660- 13:20.060* :  killing her husband and vowed to continue his fight to change Russia.
*13:25.920- 13:32.800* :  Having killed Alexei, Putin killed half of me, half of my heart, and half of my soul. But I still
*13:32.800- 13:39.320* :  have the other half, and that tells me I have no right to give up. I will continue the work of Alexei
*13:39.320- 13:46.200* :  Navalny, continue to fight for our country. Julia Navalny was in Brussels today, meeting European
*13:46.200- 13:52.540* :  foreign ministers. Meanwhile, back in Russia, at a makeshift shrine to Alexei Navalny, we discovered
*13:52.540- 13:58.200* :  that many of the flowers laid had been cleared away, and yet muskivites were still coming here,
*13:58.680- 14:05.340* :  laying roses and carnations, to honour the man who called for change, but would never live to see
*14:05.340- 14:11.820* :  that. Steve Rosenberg in Russia, or Mrs Navalny has, until now, kept a fairly low profile.
*14:12.460- 14:16.940* :  But with her powerful statements of defiance, she's emerged as the face of Russia's opposition,
*14:17.240- 14:19.940* :  as our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford reports.
*14:20.840- 14:26.120* :  This is a deliberate and dramatic step into the political spotlight by a woman who had always
*14:26.120- 14:31.440* :  played a supporting role. Julia Navalny was often to be seen by her husband's side,
*14:31.440- 14:37.500* :  at political protests, at court hearings, there let his bedside when he was poisoned in 2020.
*14:38.420- 14:43.260* :  That was the first time she really spoke out, when she had to sound the alarm about her husband's
*14:43.260- 14:47.020* :  health and demand clearance to fly him abroad for emergency treatment.
*14:47.960- 14:52.140* :  Otherwise, she was a quiet presence, slightly mysterious, even frosty.
*14:52.840- 14:58.040* :  Now Alexei Navalny is dead, his widow has taken on both his style and his cause.
*14:58.960- 15:04.120* :  For Russians, her character and strength will be a revelation, the way she speaks when her grief
*15:04.120- 15:10.620* :  is still so raw, is both painful to watch and compelling. The couple's love was always apparent.
*15:10.620- 15:15.540* :  Julia Navalny says it's that and her fury that are driving her on.
*15:16.420- 15:21.120* :  Bill Browder campaigns for economic sanctions against the Russian elite for human rights abuses.
*15:21.820- 15:25.040* :  And he thinks Julia Navalny has been underestimated.
*15:25.540- 15:33.080* :  The Navalny family is a political family, his wife is equally impressive and she's still alive
*15:33.080- 15:37.740* :  and she's defiant and she's going to carry on the fight. And I think that couldn't really
*15:38.400- 15:40.940* :  miscalculate it by killing Alexei Navalny.
*15:41.260- 15:46.580* :  But if Julia Navalny is now putting herself forward as a political leader, then the question is
*15:46.580- 15:52.560* :  of whom. Vladimir Putin has spent more than two decades crushing all organized opposition.
*15:53.300- 15:56.920* :  Navalny's political organization has been banned as extremist.
*15:57.320- 16:02.280* :  Many of his team are in prison, many more of them and his supporters have fled the country for
*16:02.700- 16:08.060* :  the safety. The piles of flowers at memorials all over Russia show that Navalny does still have
*16:08.060- 16:14.580* :  many sympathisers. His widow has called on them to unite into a fist to punch at Putin's regime.
*16:14.580- 16:20.500* :  But in life Alexei Navalny did that the hardest of all and he's paid a huge price.
*16:20.620- 16:27.880* :  Sarah Rainsford, the death of Alexei Navalny has drawn widespread condemnation from Western countries,
*16:28.380- 16:33.880* :  who overwhelmingly directly blame President Putin for his death. But that's not all they blame him for.
*16:34.420- 16:39.720* :  It's nearly two years since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in recent days Russian forces
*16:39.720- 16:46.820* :  took the eastern town of Adivka following months of grinding warfare in which hundreds of soldiers
*16:46.820- 16:51.900* :  on both sides have died. The BBC's Andrew Harding has just been to the front line in eastern
*16:51.900- 16:56.040* :  Ukraine to talk to some of the civilians still there amidst the bloodshed.
*16:59.480- 17:06.540* :  Upon Tune Bridge across an icy river we're driving back to Lima, a front line town in eastern Ukraine.
*17:07.540- 17:13.400* :  It's a year since our last visit. Lima is still in ruins. It was seized by Russian forces
*17:13.880- 17:19.080* :  then liberated in 2022 but the nearby front lines have barely moved since then.
*17:19.440- 17:26.260* :  Alexander Rogovitz, 74 now, is still here. He's surrounded by calves and still living in the
*17:26.260- 17:33.040* :  wreckage of his old apartment block hit by Russian missiles. As he shows me the ruins he says he's
*17:33.040- 17:40.240* :  had a rethink about this long war. I want beef, beef, beef. So has your opinion changed?
*17:40.320- 17:46.560* :  Change, so this is interesting. He's changed his opinion over the course of the last year. Before
*17:46.560- 17:51.940* :  he said Ukraine had to win this war. Now he's saying there's been too much death, too much suffering.
*17:51.940- 17:57.700* :  He wants talks, even if it means giving up land, peace is more important than victory.
*18:03.740- 18:09.480* :  You can feel the weariness on the streets of Leman, a crowd of pensioners queuing here for food.
*18:10.160- 18:14.760* :  They barely react to the muffled boom of an explosion from the front lines.
*18:17.540- 18:22.260* :  Our youth are being exterminated. If this continues, there'll be no Ukraine left.
*18:22.720- 18:29.940* :  Says 80-year-old Nadiezhda. This war will go on for a long time, yet says pressure. Maybe hundreds of years.
*18:37.520- 18:44.680* :  But it's not all gloom here. Council workers are out doing what they can. The war is too close for
*18:44.680- 18:52.400* :  major reconstruction work, but they're trimming trees with paying pensions. And a younger generation
*18:53.160- 18:59.180* :  is just getting on with life. School is mostly online, but every day children gather in these
*18:59.180- 19:07.340* :  classrooms for help with homework and just to meet up. Laughing with her friends 14-year-old
*19:07.340- 19:13.500* :  Anja says, I've got everything I need here. I don't want anything else except peace and calm.
*19:17.160- 19:21.580* :  A year ago, we found families hiding from the war in these dark cellars.
*19:22.140- 19:27.200* :  And today, our apartment destroyed the Dimitrenko family are still down here.
*19:30.340- 19:34.800* :  But there's regular electricity now, and television showing the latest news.
*19:35.280- 19:41.620* :  And water can be pumped from a well in the yard. Filling her bucket, Irina, and accountant just
*19:41.620- 19:49.680* :  home from work, sounds quietly determined. We're waiting for victory, she says. We're all tired,
*19:49.680- 19:56.620* :  but I don't see how we can negotiate with murderers. Liemann's mayor has moved his office
*19:56.620- 20:03.160* :  for fear of more Russian missiles. He's now worried that America will stop supplying weapons to
*20:03.160- 20:11.860* :  the Ukrainian troops protecting his town. We're fighting a monster, says Alexander Zhuravlyov.
*20:12.140- 20:18.620* :  So we need more outside military help. Our soldiers are doing their best, but they're running out of
*20:18.620- 20:28.580* :  guns and ammunition. Fresh snow blankets the towners we drive out. No one place can capture the mood
*20:28.580- 20:34.820* :  in this vast country. But perhaps Liemann, torn between despair and determination,
*20:35.680- 20:39.860* :  gets somewhere close. That report by Andrew Harding in eastern Ukraine.
*20:41.160- 20:46.860* :  Finland plans to enhance its defence against a potential invasion by Russia by opening more
*20:46.860- 20:52.500* :  than 300 new shooting ranges by the end of the decade in a reversal of an earlier trend,
*20:52.960- 20:57.760* :  which saw many of them close. It's part of a push to involve its citizens more directly in its
*20:57.760- 21:03.600* :  defence. Our Europe Regional Editor, Alice Adley reports. Finland shares a border with Russia,
*21:03.600- 21:10.520* :  which stretches more than 1300 kilometres. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years
*21:10.520- 21:16.800* :  ago, Finland has become NATO's newest member and has been busy procuring defence equipment from
*21:16.800- 21:22.220* :  around the world. And among other things, it's commissioned an air defence system from Israel
*21:22.220- 21:29.380* :  and combat helmets from the USA. Helsinki also signed a $1.8 million contract last year
*21:29.380- 21:35.500* :  with a Finnish firearms manufacturer for single-shot semi-automatic rifles. They'll be used to
*21:35.500- 21:41.080* :  train citizens on how to defend their country from invaders. The number of voluntary defence courses
*21:41.080- 21:46.200* :  for people to learn shooting skills has doubled in the last year, and there's also been a big
*21:46.200- 21:51.380* :  increase in the number of applications for gun licenses. The government's plan is to provide
*21:51.380- 21:56.480* :  around a thousand outdoor shooting ranges for target practice. A spokesman for the Defence
*21:56.480- 22:02.500* :  Training Association, the MPK, says the desire to participate in national defence is strong.
*22:02.500- 22:08.640* :  His comments on social media are accompanied by pictures of fins training on firearms in the snow.
*22:09.280- 22:12.860* :  The initiative, which will rely on the community's willingness to participate,
*22:12.860- 22:17.200* :  is aimed at safeguarding Finland's sovereignty. Alice Adley.
*22:20.100- 22:24.620* :  Still to come. They're buying household goods. They're even paying took-took drivers through
*22:24.620- 22:30.720* :  PTM. Even for a street food, they're paying through PTM apps. Now, one of the biggest online payment
*22:30.720- 22:34.100* :  companies in India has come under the radar of the central bank.
*22:38.680- 22:45.260* :  When you see Iran close up, you realise just how complex a political landscape it is.
*22:45.540- 22:50.680* :  The global story smart takes and fresh perspectives on one big new story.
*22:50.680- 22:55.700* :  It seems that Iran's strategy at the moment is to increase the tension in the Middle East.
*22:55.700- 23:01.680* :  Every Monday to Friday from the BBC World Service. When Israel does agree to cease fire in Gaza,
*23:01.680- 23:06.260* :  Iran will then worry about Israel then turning its sights towards Iran again.

*24:19.440- 24:25.880* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. Next to Nigeria. The Nigerian currency, the Naira,
*24:25.880- 24:31.120* :  has fallen to new record lows against the US dollar. While the stock market posted its biggest
*24:31.120- 24:35.520* :  one day fall in more than a year, or these latest economic crises,
*24:35.940- 24:42.160* :  commerce protests were held in the southern city of Ibadun against high inflation and the rising
*24:42.160- 24:46.260* :  cost of living. Similar demonstrations were held in northern Nigeria two weeks ago.
*24:46.640- 24:49.560* :  These people say they're badly affected by the high inflation.
*24:50.120- 24:56.320* :  It cannot get foods that is less than 1,000 euro. You have to have 1,000 euro or more to get food in
*24:56.380- 25:01.820* :  Ibadun. And the electricity is so bad. If nobody likes for like how many days now,
*25:02.160- 25:05.420* :  it might be having lights and the eats too much for us.
*25:05.540- 25:10.060* :  Primarily I believe Nigerians have protested because of the high cost of living,
*25:10.060- 25:15.800* :  the increasing hardship Nigerians go through every day. For me, the things we used to buy
*25:15.800- 25:23.160* :  before are almost three times double the price now. Luke Jones heard more from the BBC Africa
*25:23.160- 25:29.340* :  business reporter Kaichi Obonu, who was in the Nigerian commercial capital, Lagos.
*25:29.740- 25:34.280* :  There are about two major things that are driving the cost of living in Nigeria.
*25:34.280- 25:43.940* :  First is the exchange rate. Now, a lot of people depend on foreign exchange too. Either
*25:43.940- 25:49.900* :  import finished goods or to import raw materials that would be used in local production.
*25:50.640- 25:56.360* :  Because of the scarcity of the US dollar in the country, a lot of people have been going
*25:56.360- 26:01.080* :  to the black market, which is the parallel market, to source foreign exchange.
*26:01.800- 26:07.920* :  And this has caused a huge demand for the US dollar. And so, people are getting their foreign
*26:07.920- 26:13.620* :  exchange at crazy rates across the country. For instance, at the close of trading today,
*26:13.620- 26:23.520* :  Monday, the dollar closed at about 1,700 and 19 Mayera. It's the highest record high in decades.
*26:23.520- 26:29.300* :  It has never been this high. Gosh. And there also has been some upset about the withdrawal of
*26:29.480- 26:36.140* :  fuel subsidies as well. Explain that and what impact it's having. Of course, the second reason
*26:36.140- 26:44.340* :  is the price of fuel. Now, in parts of a 90% of its fuel needs, because it cannot
*26:44.380- 26:48.340* :  refine fuel locally. It's refineries are not working.
*26:49.000- 26:53.620* :  Ok, Chi of Banu reporting. Now, when you have debate for something,
*26:53.620- 26:58.880* :  Chi is cash or an app. If you're in India, many people have started making online payments
*26:59.420- 27:05.560* :  through what are called digital wallets. Paytm is amongst the largest wallets operating in the
*27:05.560- 27:10.400* :  country. But it's now in trouble with India's central bank. The Vayna Gupta heard more from the
*27:10.400- 27:16.580* :  BBC's Archana Shukla, who's in Mumbai. Paytm is India's one of the leading digital payments
*27:16.580- 27:22.640* :  company. In fact, they are the ones who revolutionized making payments to just a click on your phone.
*27:22.860- 27:27.340* :  You know, people started using the app to make a range of transactions. They're buying household goods.
*27:27.340- 27:32.200* :  They're even paying, took, took drivers through Paytm. Even for a street food, they're paying
*27:32.200- 27:38.360* :  through Paytm apps, Paytm and similar apps and paying their utility bills like power or mobile
*27:38.360- 27:43.820* :  phone payments and the other sorts of payments. So, all of this is powered by a digital wallet.
*27:44.100- 27:49.120* :  Essentially, it's a small bank account, almost like a bank account in which people can
*27:49.120- 27:54.740* :  receive deposits. They can keep money. They can make all the payments by scanning a QR code,
*27:54.740- 28:00.700* :  using their mobile phones as their identity. Merchants at their end also have digital wallets.
*28:00.700- 28:05.380* :  They also have accounts where they're receiving these payments. So, essentially, everything is
*28:05.380- 28:11.520* :  happening in a digital domain and all the payments transactions are happening through just a click
*28:11.520- 28:18.100* :  of on your mobile phone. And we're talking about some 300 million plus users just with this
*28:18.100- 28:23.480* :  particular app. So, what went wrong then? Paytm started a Paytm Paytm payments bank,
*28:23.480- 28:30.900* :  which can take deposits of up to $2,400 US dollars. It can sell something like an insurance
*28:30.900- 28:35.880* :  product or loan products through other third-party banks. So, they started this bank, but in the
*28:35.880- 28:40.240* :  last few years, there have been multiple times when the central bank has raised objections
*28:40.240- 28:44.560* :  and how they've been doing the business because there are concerns that this could lead to money
*28:44.560- 28:50.580* :  laundering as well. That's why the Reserve Bank of India asked them to stop all banking services.
*28:51.100- 28:56.900* :  What happens now? Now because of the central banks ruling which doesn't allow them to do any
*28:56.900- 29:02.700* :  banking services, they are transferring all this back-end work to another brick-and-watt
*29:02.700- 29:09.820* :  mortar bank called the Axis Bank. And that will become the back-end bank. So, about 50% of all
*29:09.820- 29:16.200* :  merchant accounts on Paytm Payments Bank will need to be transferred onto this brick-and-mortar
*29:16.200- 29:22.040* :  Axis Bank. Ashina Shukla in Mumbai. Julian Assange, the founder of the whistle-blowing website
*29:22.040- 29:27.340* :  WikiLeaks, begins what could be his final court hearing in London today to appeal against his
*29:27.340- 29:32.620* :  extradition to the United States. The case against him goes back to 2010 and the release of US
*29:32.620- 29:38.800* :  classified information on the WikiLeaks site. Just two years later in 2012, Mr Assange sought refuge
*29:38.800- 29:44.040* :  in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He spent seven years in that building before emerging to
*29:44.040- 29:50.040* :  face criminal charges and has been in an English prison since then. Julian Assange's wife Stella
*29:50.040- 29:55.580* :  has been speaking to my colleague, Michelle Hussain. This could very well be the final hearing for
*29:55.580- 30:01.260* :  Julian in the UK because if he loses this round, there is no possibility for further appeal
*30:01.760- 30:08.360* :  in this jurisdiction. And that means that the UK Home Office will then move to extradite him.
*30:09.100- 30:15.500* :  And we know that in other cases that has been a matter of 24 hours, we are hoping that we'll
*30:15.500- 30:20.380* :  have time to apply to the European Court of Human Rights and try to get an emergency injunction
*30:20.380- 30:26.760* :  to stay that extradition. But at the moment, it's so uncertain and the stakes are so high,
*30:26.760- 30:32.880* :  if he's extradited to the US, he won't survive it ultimately. So we need to stop it. That's my
*30:32.880- 30:38.500* :  reading of how things are going to go. How is he now because it's been what, nearly five years in
*30:38.500- 30:42.940* :  in Belmarsh, high security prison, how's he doing? Well, it's very difficult for him.
*30:42.940- 30:48.840* :  Obviously, this period is extremely stressful. He doesn't sleep because he loses his appetite
*30:48.840- 30:55.140* :  and he knows that anything could happen. He has the support of his own government, doesn't he?
*30:55.140- 30:59.960* :  The Australian government, including the Prime Minister, who wants the US and the UK to bring this
*31:00.520- 31:06.240* :  to an end, could the UK government bring it to an end? Do they have that within their power?
*31:06.500- 31:10.700* :  Well, look, this extradition request should never have been accepted by the UK government,
*31:10.700- 31:16.560* :  because it's an extradition for political offenses under the Espionage Act, and that is prohibited
*31:16.560- 31:22.960* :  under Article 4 of the US-UK Exhibition Treaty. So it should never have even gone to the courts.
*31:22.960- 31:28.540* :  The previous government was wrong to accept it. And of course, the new home secretary could review
*31:28.540- 31:33.520* :  that decision and reach the correct conclusion that it is in violation of their own treaty
*31:33.520- 31:37.620* :  with the United States. Why do you think that hasn't happened? Well, this is a political case.
*31:37.620- 31:44.700* :  It's a politically motivated subject matter, which is publishing evidence of state criminality of
*31:44.700- 31:48.820* :  the country that's trying to extradite Julian is political. It came about during Trump
*31:48.820- 31:53.940* :  administration who wanted to use Julian's case as a precedent to be able to go after the press
*31:53.940- 31:59.340* :  under the Espionage Act. This is an unprecedented case. The Espionage Act has never been used
*31:59.340- 32:04.260* :  against the publisher for receiving information and possessing it and communicating it to the
*32:04.260- 32:08.740* :  public. And let's remember that Julian is not the whistleblower here. That was Chelsea Manning
*32:08.880- 32:12.880* :  who gave Julian the material, who gave WikiLeaks material so it could be published.
*32:13.420- 32:18.100* :  There's no question about the public interest of that material, which evidence to work
*32:18.100- 32:22.900* :  on is torture, criminality and so on. And the Biden administration has continued this,
*32:22.900- 32:27.880* :  and it seems that are determined to continue with it, despite what the Australian government has
*32:28.120- 32:33.640* :  has asked them to do. There are some MPs supporting your husband, but not that many. And I wonder if
*32:33.640- 32:39.260* :  you look back on that period in the Ecuadorian embassy the seven years that he spent there trying
*32:39.260- 32:46.100* :  to avoid the extradition request by being there. And think now that that was the wrong thing to
*32:46.100- 32:50.060* :  do, and that is why you haven't got as much political sympathies you would have hoped for.
*32:50.680- 32:55.420* :  Well, it's easy to look back now and say, well, maybe things would have been different.
*32:55.420- 33:01.760* :  Even before that, Chelsea Manning had been in prison for seven years. There was a lot of
*33:01.820- 33:07.660* :  very threatening statements coming out of the United States, calling Julian a terrorist,
*33:08.000- 33:13.220* :  and so on. And that's why Ecuador, when they made their determination, it was based on
*33:13.580- 33:17.980* :  Chelsea Manning's treatment in US custody, which the UN Special Rapporteur on torture set
*33:17.980- 33:23.520* :  amounted to cruel and inhuman, invigorating treatment. And actually the new UN Special Rapporteur
*33:23.520- 33:29.420* :  just last week issued a statement saying Julian should not be extraded from the UK because he risks
*33:29.800- 33:33.980* :  torturous treatment in the United States. That was Julian Assange's wife Stella.
*33:34.760- 33:38.540* :  Now to Easter Island, a remote trillion territory in Polynesia.
*33:38.840- 33:44.120* :  Its native name is Rapa Nui, and it's famous for hundreds of statues created by the early
*33:44.120- 33:49.380* :  Napa people that populate the island. That is except for two, which light in the British museum
*33:49.380- 33:55.240* :  in London. They were taken in 1868, and the museum is now facing an online campaign to get them back.
*33:55.240- 34:00.980* :  On Sunday, the museum said it had to deactivate comments on its social media pages after they
*34:00.980- 34:06.220* :  were overrun by campaigners. Paul Henley spoke to one man who wants the stone monuments returned.
*34:06.220- 34:11.400* :  He's Sebastian Power, the former tourism chief on the island. He says the statues
*34:11.400- 34:17.020* :  or Moai are important to their culture. For us is our ancestor. I need to be clear with this.
*34:17.520- 34:22.940* :  We don't talk about one archaeologist's staff, the British museum, they have for us. We don't
*34:22.940- 34:27.120* :  talk about one culture who was disappeared and when they lost the language. We talk about one
*34:27.120- 34:31.940* :  culture in Easter Island who will still to believe in our ancestor. We'll still to believe in our
*34:31.940- 34:37.160* :  Moais and the reason why we created it. And in the case of the Moai Huahakananaya is one of the
*34:37.160- 34:42.180* :  most important ones. Not just because it's unique in the way how they make and the materials they use,
*34:42.660- 34:48.320* :  it's also because it's our symbol in this island. Can you explain what the statues look like? I know
*34:48.320- 34:53.160* :  they're a very famous symbol of Easter Island. Perhaps you could just try to explain those who aren't
*34:53.160- 34:57.260* :  familiar with the look of them. First, if you take a look at the back of this Moai, they have
*34:57.260- 35:02.220* :  petroglyph about the last age of Easter Island, about the age of the Burman. So we can say the
*35:02.220- 35:07.020* :  only symbol can explain you both age, the age of the Moai and the age of the Burman competition.
