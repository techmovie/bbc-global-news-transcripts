*00:17.900- 00:21.920* :  You know, it's hard to believe that inflation is still a thing, but boy, it sure is.

*00:27.220- 00:33.660* :  Well, it's also because we have that offer printed on, like a million t-shirts, but it's mostly the inflation thing.

*01:19.560- 01:24.440* :  Hi, I'm Una Chaplin and I'm the host of a new podcast called Hollywood Exiles.
*01:25.140- 01:30.740* :  It tells the story of how my grandfather Charlie Chaplin and many others were caught up
*01:30.880- 01:33.980* :  in a campaign to root out communism in Hollywood.

*01:42.500- 01:45.120* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:47.320- 01:52.300* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 26th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:52.860- 01:57.820* :  Israel says it's making evacuation plans for garrisons as a ground assault on Raffa
*01:57.820- 02:03.280* :  draws nearer, the UN response. In Brussels, farmers block the streets and take on the police.
*02:03.280- 02:05.600* :  Will the politicians give them what they want?
*02:05.620- 02:10.680* :  We found out why the British Prime Minister is having to deny accusations of Islamophobia
*02:10.980- 02:11.680* :  within his party.
*02:14.060- 02:19.260* :  Also in this podcast, we report from Alabama in the US where a court ruling that even frozen
*02:19.260- 02:22.900* :  embryos our children is dividing anti-abortion groups.
*02:23.260- 02:25.680* :  I mean, it tells you to go forth and be fruitful and multiply.
*02:25.680- 02:30.060* :  We're forcing some women to have the children they don't have and we're preventing other women
*02:30.060- 02:31.420* :  from having the children they want.
*02:31.920- 02:35.720* :  And a welcome sign of life from a stricken Japanese lunar land.
*02:39.220- 02:43.640* :  We start with concerns over the prospect of an Israeli ground assault on Raffa.
*02:43.860- 02:48.420* :  That is the city and the southernmost part of Gaza where more than a million people have fled
*02:48.420- 02:53.260* :  since the conflict began. On Sunday, even with seaside talks going on,
*02:53.260- 02:57.960* :  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the army would launch a full ground
*02:57.960- 03:01.720* :  invasion of Raffa to achieve total victory over Hamas.
*03:02.440- 03:07.240* :  The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterresh outlined the problems he says that will bring.
*03:18.100- 03:24.980* :  It's a very efficient Raffa is the core of the humanitarian operation and UNRA is the backbone
*03:24.980- 03:32.060* :  of that effort and allot is a allot in Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying
*03:32.060- 03:35.160* :  for more than a million Palestinian civilians sheltering there.
*03:35.740- 03:39.600* :  It would put the final nail in the coffin of our eight programs.
*03:40.400- 03:42.620* :  Jenny Hill is our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*03:42.620- 03:47.640* :  I asked her first for developments in the talks about a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.
*03:48.120- 03:53.180* :  Overnight, the American National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said that talks in
*03:53.180- 04:00.120* :  Paris over the weekend between Israel, the US, Qatar and Egypt had thrashed out what he
*04:00.120- 04:06.440* :  described as the contours of a deal. Now, those details and we're still waiting to really see
*04:06.440- 04:09.860* :  being thrashed out properly by negotiators. There's still a lot more work to do,
*04:10.520- 04:16.320* :  but broadly speaking, it's reported what we're looking at is the release of around 40 Israeli
*04:16.320- 04:21.520* :  hostages in exchange for several hundred Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and a temporary
*04:21.520- 04:26.640* :  ceasefire of around six weeks. Now, I say, you know, the deal is still potentially along way off
*04:26.640- 04:31.380* :  because Hamas have not yet responded to it and we know that there were a lot of sticking points.
*04:31.700- 04:37.860* :  So, Jenny, that ceasefire process seems to be inching forward. It might even be overtaken by a
*04:37.860- 04:43.380* :  possible invasion of Raffa and the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, made it clearer
*04:43.380- 04:48.140* :  than ever that that will go ahead. Yes, Mr Netanyahu, I think, is doing two things. Obviously,
*04:48.140- 04:53.440* :  he's keeping up the pressure. He's also very conscious that he's got right wing hardliners in his
*04:53.440- 04:58.180* :  coalition who, upon whose support he depends and he's got a public who, you know, want to see an end
*04:58.180- 05:03.420* :  to this war. So, he's come out yet again insisting that he's going to go into Raffa with this
*05:03.420- 05:10.380* :  much publicized ground offensive. He also says that he will move displaced Palestinians, civilians,
*05:10.380- 05:14.760* :  sheltering in the city out of Hamas way before that begins. Now, he's been saying for a long time
*05:14.760- 05:19.780* :  he's going to do that, but we still don't have details of how exactly he plans to get them to
*05:19.780- 05:24.240* :  safety because as aid agencies and foreign governments have been warning for some weeks now,
*05:24.460- 05:30.940* :  there aren't very many safe places if any for people to go if they leave Raffa. So, that is
*05:30.940- 05:35.560* :  causing huge international concern. Mr Netanyahu, interestingly, has also said that even if there
*05:35.560- 05:40.080* :  is a truce, it will just delay his ground offensive in Raffa. Jenny, one other development
*05:40.080- 05:46.380* :  this morning, the Palestinian Prime Minister has handed in his resignation to the president
*05:46.380- 05:52.420* :  in the West Bank there. How significant is that? On the face of it, he's not a particularly high
*05:52.420- 05:56.540* :  profile figure. Mahmoud Abbas, of course, the president of the Palestinian Authority is much,
*05:56.540- 06:01.800* :  much higher profile. What's really interesting about this, though, is it's all feeds into what
*06:01.820- 06:06.680* :  is going to happen once this war ends? Who's going to look after Gaza, and what is that going to
*06:06.680- 06:11.400* :  look like? A lot of analysts are saying this resignation will pave the way potentially for
*06:11.980- 06:18.020* :  a government of technocrats. The US wants to see a reformed Palestinian Authority running
*06:18.020- 06:23.640* :  Gaza once the war ends. Interestingly, that's something that Benjamin Netanyahu appears at this
*06:23.660- 06:29.720* :  stage to have ruled out. He issued a two-page document a couple of days ago, outlining his plan
*06:29.720- 06:34.940* :  for Gaza once the war ends, and it didn't mention the Palestinian Authority once. So we'll have
*06:34.940- 06:39.060* :  to wait and see, but it does suggest that there is a little bit of movement and it's worth
*06:39.060- 06:45.020* :  keeping an eye on. Jenny Hill. For decades, the debate over reproductive rights in the United States
*06:45.020- 06:50.140* :  has been fueled by Christian groups opposed to abortion, but those campaigners have been left
*06:50.140- 06:56.660* :  divided after Alabama's Supreme Court ruled that all embryos are children, including those
*06:56.660- 07:03.600* :  frozen for use in IVF treatment. Whilst the main ruling cited existing laws, the Chief Justice
*07:03.600- 07:08.300* :  explained his support in religious terms, saying that even before birth, all human beings
*07:08.720- 07:14.420* :  have the image of God. Hospitals and clinics have paused fertility treatments over fears they
*07:14.420- 07:19.160* :  could be prosecuted. Our US correspondent, Nomi Igbal, has this report from Alabama.
*07:20.000- 07:24.900* :  I feel like I'm going to get teary. For Margaret Boyce, the politics has become personal.
*07:25.040- 07:30.320* :  The journey to become parents is just so hard and anxiety-inducing. This ruling should not
*07:31.100- 07:37.100* :  add anxiety onto something that's already just so taxing on you. She and her husband have a young
*07:37.100- 07:42.200* :  son but want to build their family. They tend to IVF and would days away from the first appointment.
*07:42.680- 07:47.580* :  For a devout Christian-like Margaret who describes herself as pro-life, the ruling is difficult to
*07:47.580- 07:53.220* :  comprehend. I mean, he tells you to go forth and be fruitful and multiply. I mean, nobody understands
*07:53.220- 07:59.220* :  more that that embryo is not a child more than the person that is yearning for that embryo
*07:59.220- 08:04.660* :  to be a child. The Supreme Court here used an existing law in the state regarding wrongful death
*08:04.660- 08:10.580* :  of a minor, so it covers not just fetuses in the womb, but now embryos held in a lab or storage
*08:10.580- 08:16.520* :  facility. So this is where the storage facility is. Each of these tanks has stored eggs and sperm.
*08:16.580- 08:21.900* :  Dr. Beth Militsier co-founded Alabama Fatility. She's showing us where the embryos are safely
*08:21.900- 08:26.400* :  stored, but they have paused all new treatments until they get clarity on what happens next.
*08:26.680- 08:31.880* :  I think most of us feel like there's been some door blown up, blown open, and we don't know what's
*08:31.880- 08:36.720* :  on the other side of that door. I have had to call patients, I called several patients yesterday
*08:36.720- 08:40.460* :  to have to tell them that we were not able to fall their embryo and transfer it.
*08:43.360- 08:48.320* :  Across town, we meet lawyer Rodney Miller. He and his wife turned to IVF after 10 years of trying.
*08:48.320- 08:54.120* :  They have two twins thanks to frozen embryos they adopted. They describe themselves as pro-life,
*08:54.120- 08:58.320* :  but Rodney thinks this ruling went too far. We found ourselves in this weird position where
*08:59.060- 09:03.000* :  we're forcing some women to have the children they don't have, and we're preventing other women
*09:03.000- 09:09.400* :  from having the children they want. I'm just outside the Supreme Court here in Alabama, and that
*09:09.400- 09:14.180* :  decision that was made in the building behind me has seen huge reaction from politicians across
*09:14.180- 09:20.060* :  the country, especially Republicans sensing a political backlash. Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are
*09:20.060- 09:24.260* :  both vying to be the Republican presidential nominee, and they've called for IVF to be protected,
*09:24.260- 09:29.720* :  but it's local lawmakers here who have to come up with the solution. I think we can do this in two
*09:29.720- 09:35.140* :  weeks if regional lines can come together and we seem to in crisis situations. Republicans
*09:35.140- 09:40.700* :  like Senator Tim Nelson are trying to find a way to balance the divided religious constituency.
*09:40.700- 09:45.920* :  And what would you say to people in this state who are just so distraught right now?
*09:45.920- 09:52.940* :  Just be patient. We're going to find a fix. Just don't worry about it as little or worry about
*09:52.940- 09:57.060* :  as little as you can because we're going to find an answer. Hopefully clinics will be open soon,
*09:57.060- 10:01.020* :  and you can get back to your normal infertility issues instead of worrying about access.
*10:01.300- 10:05.720* :  Has the intervention by the former president Donald Trump put pressure on you?
*10:05.920- 10:11.920* :  Now, or anybody else. I mean Biden came out. Haley's come out. Let's just get it right. We know
*10:11.920- 10:15.900* :  it. We need to help these individuals. And if they thought we should go the opposite way,
*10:15.900- 10:18.580* :  I'm still going to do what I think's right, which is what this is.
*10:18.800- 10:24.800* :  The Democratic Party's censored an opportunity, but also danger. Anthony Daniels is the party's
*10:24.800- 10:29.900* :  house leader here. Other countries and other places that consider themselves to be extremely conservative.
*10:30.120- 10:35.780* :  Could follow suit Alabama has an opportunity to to write this wrong. And we want to make certain
*10:35.780- 10:39.940* :  that we're able to get the train back on track. Two years on after the constitutional
*10:39.940- 10:45.600* :  right to an abortion was banned in America, this IVF ruling has opened a new battle front in
*10:45.600- 10:52.460* :  reproductive rights. Republicans want to minimize the controversy. Democrats want to tie them to it.
*10:53.200- 11:01.220* :  Nomi Iqbal in Alabama. A woman in Pakistan has survived being attacked by a mob that mistakenly
*11:01.220- 11:06.340* :  accused her of blasphemy. They thought her shirt was adorned with verses from the Quran,
*11:06.340- 11:13.060* :  but in fact, the word Hawa was printed on it in Arabic letters, meaning sweet. Police had
*11:13.060- 11:18.280* :  a step in to protect her. The BBC's Islamabad correspondent Caroline Davis is following the story.
*11:22.540- 11:26.420* :  Footage posted on social media shows the woman sheltering at the back of a restaurant,
*11:26.420- 11:31.340* :  covering her face and looking visibly terrified as a crowd of men surround her shouting,
*11:31.340- 11:36.720* :  held back only by a few police officers. The authorities estimate that it took only a matter of
*11:36.720- 11:43.360* :  minutes for a crowd of between 200 to 300 people together. The woman's cutter or long shirt was
*11:43.360- 11:48.420* :  decorated in brightly coloured Arabic calligraphy, which the mob incorrectly thought were verses from
*11:48.420- 11:53.940* :  the Quran, accusing her of blasphemy. That's punishable by death in Pakistan, although some people
*11:53.940- 11:58.700* :  have been lynched even before their cases go to trial. By the time the assistant superintendent of
*11:58.700- 12:04.560* :  police Sayyed Esherbano arrived at the scene, the increasingly charged crowd with shouting that
*12:04.560- 12:09.780* :  blasphemers should be beheaded. They were of the opinion that they're going to drag the woman outside
*12:10.020- 12:16.780* :  and they're going to deal with her their own way. So we had to negotiate and tell them
*12:17.660- 12:22.700* :  that her actions are going to be taken account of and we're going to hold her responsible for whatever
*12:22.700- 12:28.780* :  crying they think that she has committed. Have you not taken her out and not had her not screamed
*12:28.780- 12:33.120* :  and had her not convinced that we will do something about it? It would have turned out last year.
*12:33.400- 12:38.260* :  Surrounded by officers who formed the only barrier, Ms. Shabano put her arm around the woman,
*12:38.260- 12:43.180* :  now covered by a black robe and headscarf and pushed through the crowd. The officers were able
*12:43.180- 12:47.380* :  to get the woman to a police station where religious scholars confirmed that the text on the dress
*12:47.380- 12:52.660* :  was not verses from the Quran. The scholars recorded a video stating their findings and that the
*12:52.660- 12:57.960* :  woman was innocent. The woman too gave a public apology. According to police, she was not from the
*12:57.960- 13:03.740* :  city and has now left with her husband. Caroline Davis. Here in the UK, a government committee will
*13:03.740- 13:10.000* :  be debating tourism in Antarctica today. The number of people visiting Antarctica will hit
*13:10.000- 13:15.580* :  100,000 for the first time in this tourist season, which runs until March. But there are
*13:15.580- 13:20.980* :  concerns that it's damaging the wilderness even though the trips are marketed as raising awareness
*13:20.980- 13:28.540* :  and giving more people a sense of wonder that helps protect it. Camilla Nickel is CEO of the UK
*13:28.540- 13:34.780* :  Antarctic Heritage Trust. There are very tight guidelines on how visitors can land at various
*13:34.780- 13:41.160* :  places, the numbers are sure, what they can and cannot do, proximity to wildlife, all that sort of
*13:41.280- 13:45.500* :  thing. I think it's about managing impact, it's about better understanding what the impacts of
*13:45.820- 13:50.860* :  anybody visiting Antarctica might be and are and planning for those, but also managing what the
*13:50.860- 13:54.820* :  impacts could be. So it's getting a better understanding, providing a framework in which anybody
*13:55.460- 14:00.080* :  managing operations in Antarctica can abide by and to minimise that impact on this amazing
*14:00.080- 14:04.740* :  and precious wilderness. So I think we're all kind of supportive of this, but it doesn't need
*14:04.740- 14:09.100* :  managing better. Numbers is hard to manage, but you're just with the way the Antarctic
*14:09.140- 14:14.580* :  protocol and the Antarctic Treaty laws and frameworks are delivered. But managing impact is what
*14:14.620- 14:18.980* :  needs to happen here. Camilla Nickel of the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust.
*14:21.780- 14:27.640* :  Coming up in this podcast, to have time off with my child, it was like a completely new thing and

*16:25.180- 16:31.440* :  Next to Brussels and as EU agriculture ministers meet in quiet conference rooms outside
*16:31.460- 16:33.700* :  on the streets, it is far more raucous.
*16:40.960- 16:46.900* :  Burning tyres belching black smoke, confrontations with the police and streets clogged by huge
*16:46.900- 16:51.280* :  tractors. The farmers have come from Belgium and beyond to lobby the politicians.
*16:52.080- 16:56.440* :  It comes after weeks of protests in cities across Europe. They say they're being hit by cheap
*16:56.440- 17:02.880* :  imports from outside the EU, new environmental rules and falling incomes. I spoke to Nick Beek,
*17:02.880- 17:07.840* :  who's following the protests for us? Real anger from the farmers today. I've just come in actually
*17:08.360- 17:12.660* :  inside because it's chucking down with rain and as you could hear there in that clip, there's a lot of
*17:12.660- 17:21.000* :  noise. That's the noise of basically crackers being set off firecrackers and also the noise of
*17:21.000- 17:25.940* :  the tracks is rumbling around the city because this morning a lot of these farmers have managed to
*17:25.940- 17:30.960* :  block what is central Brussels. They've come nearly as far as the European Commission, so the main
*17:30.960- 17:36.800* :  building where the EU policy is drawn up, the executive arm of the European Union, and it's the
*17:36.800- 17:42.060* :  policies of the EU that the farmers are not happy about. We were talking to farmers who'd come from
*17:42.060- 17:45.820* :  the Czech Republic. Now they didn't come all the way in their in their tractors, but they made
*17:45.820- 17:50.200* :  their way here today and they say simply they're not being supported, that they're not getting a
*17:50.200- 17:55.780* :  decent price for the stuff that they are making, whether that's arable, whether it's grain or whether
*17:56.620- 18:02.280* :  cows, dairy farmers, they say they're not being treated well enough, and they're going to protest
*18:02.280- 18:07.420* :  until European politicians treat them better. And what kind of things do you think that the agriculture
*18:07.420- 18:13.000* :  ministers and the leaders of the EU nations would be prepared to concede? Well this is difficult
*18:13.000- 18:19.900* :  because the European Union has got quite ambitious plans to use its phrase for new green policies
*18:19.900- 18:25.040* :  when it comes to agriculture, but also a whole range of different industries. So what would they
*18:25.040- 18:30.000* :  be willing to give up on there? There's a press conference today, and this is all to do with the
*18:30.000- 18:35.280* :  meeting of agricultural ministers today in Brussels, but are they willing to ease up on some of the
*18:35.280- 18:41.400* :  green tactics that the farmers have been asked to basically implement in the way they deal with their
*18:41.760- 18:45.580* :  farming? It's hard to tell there's nothing concrete at the moment, but I think in the minds of
*18:45.580- 18:50.480* :  the politicians is the fact that according to opinion polls certainly in France and in other European
*18:50.480- 18:55.960* :  countries, there is popular support for farmers, I believe, that they have been treated not as well
*18:55.960- 19:01.640* :  as they should have been. Nick Beak. The war in Gaza has raised many concerns and issues
*19:01.640- 19:08.140* :  way beyond the conflict itself. Not least of them are rising both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia
*19:08.580- 19:13.840* :  in many nations around the world. Now the British Prime Minister Rishisunak has denied accusations
*19:13.840- 19:19.600* :  of Islamophobia within his own conservative party. He was responding for the first time to comment
*19:19.600- 19:25.800* :  made last week by Leigh Anderson, the former deputy party chairman about the mayor of London,
*19:25.800- 19:31.740* :  Saddi Khan. This is Mr Anderson on GB News. And don't actually believe that these Islamists have
*19:31.740- 19:36.660* :  got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got
*19:36.660- 19:42.700* :  control of London. And in response, the Prime Minister has gone on BBC Radio this morning,
*19:43.000- 19:49.320* :  warning of the dangers of polarisation and hatred in politics. The most important thing is that
*19:49.800- 19:54.700* :  people realise that the words they use in a situation that we're in now as their tensions are
*19:54.700- 20:00.100* :  running higher than I think any of us would like. And my priority is to try and take the heat out
*20:00.100- 20:05.360* :  of this situation. I think that's what everyone wants to see. And that's why words matter and his
*20:05.360- 20:10.640* :  words weren't acceptable. They were wrong. So why has Mr Sunak come out and said this now? Are UK
*20:10.640- 20:15.700* :  political correspondent Rob Watson is following events? He was just under a great deal of pressure
*20:15.700- 20:22.120* :  to respond in some way. And of course, it's part of the tip for tat we've seen in recent days and
*20:22.120- 20:28.000* :  weeks between the main parties. And actually what's been really striking is that even Nick in the
*20:28.000- 20:33.660* :  face of the threat of political violence against MPs, which you might think would unite Britain's
*20:33.660- 20:39.100* :  main parties, I mean, it's been remarkable the sort of partisan nature of their responses with
*20:39.100- 20:44.000* :  essentially the conservative saying that the main opposition Labour parties still not cleared up
*20:44.000- 20:49.500* :  its problem with anti-Semitism is too soft on Islamic extremism. Well, of course, you've got
*20:49.580- 20:54.960* :  the Labour parties who were just discussing saying that the conservatives have not been strong enough
*20:55.000- 20:59.820* :  on Islamophobia. So anyone who thought that the recent threats of sort of political violence
*20:59.820- 21:04.960* :  would bring people together, the reverse has happened, although clearly Mr Sunak is hoping it
*21:04.960- 21:09.840* :  will die down. I mean, one would have thought that at a time when Islamophobia and anti-Semitism
*21:09.860- 21:16.780* :  is on the rise, particularly since October the 7th, the Hamas attacks in Israel, you would have
*21:16.780- 21:20.640* :  thought that people would have set the right tone, the politicians at least, you'd like to think
*21:20.640- 21:25.100* :  they would set the right tone for the country. Well, absolutely, and I can assure you there are
*21:25.100- 21:31.040* :  plenty of MPs, Nick, who feel that way that their leaders have not done as well as they might.
*21:31.040- 21:36.800* :  I mean, I guess part of the explanation is that Britain's political system is just fantastically
*21:37.260- 21:43.480* :  partisan, Britain's not alone in that, and when one party sees an opportunity to attack another,
*21:44.000- 21:49.340* :  even when, as you say, it's against the background of an increase in Islamophobia and anti-Semitic
*21:49.340- 21:55.680* :  attacks, they somehow seem unable to resist it. Rob Watson, our UK political correspondent.
*21:57.100- 22:02.940* :  Demonstrators have marched in Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos, demanding action to reduce
*22:02.940- 22:08.460* :  the cost of living, ahead Ari planned two-day nationwide strike. A small number of protestors
*22:08.460- 22:14.120* :  carrying banners denouncing high-fuel prices were watched by police armed with automatic weapons
*22:14.120- 22:21.140* :  and tear gas. Prices are rising rapidly by 30 percent over the past year, and the currency has
*22:21.140- 22:26.440* :  plunged in value, pretty much halving in the space of a month. Let's hear from these Nigerians
*22:26.440- 22:33.060* :  in the capital, Abuja. My name is Mohamed Yusuf. I'm staying in Abuja. The economic
*22:33.060- 22:38.360* :  situation in the country is very difficult. In fact, I have never experienced this kind of hashi.
*22:38.800- 22:43.780* :  How much are you any? It can't even afford to catch you what you think you can take care of yourself
*22:43.780- 22:51.100* :  and your family. When you go to buy beans, it's 1,600 Nera per movie. I am just telling you the
*22:51.100- 22:56.620* :  common food cooking gas lies about 18,000 Nera in some places. In fact, some people don't go to
*22:56.620- 23:00.760* :  hospital again. I wonder how the hospital people are even coping. You want to get the drugs
*23:00.760- 23:08.080* :  now. It's high. Teens are very tough in Nigeria now. My name is Fitz, I'm Morgano. The cost of living
*23:08.080- 23:13.880* :  in Nigeria today is something that you cannot even imagine. You can't buy food. You can't buy
*23:13.880- 23:19.580* :  gas. There is no light. Business are not moving. The other thing is just to alarm me.
*23:19.720- 23:24.280* :  You will complain and complain and complain. There is nobody for you to complain to that we've only
*23:24.280- 23:29.680* :  seen to you. You will take a journey today coming back and pay a different price. A basket of
*23:29.680- 23:37.220* :  Garina is 2,200. Our local rice here. 859,000 Nera per basket. Our government have already failed us.
*23:37.220- 23:42.120* :  We don't even know yet to go to again. The only place we know we can cry to that is God. If
*23:42.120- 23:46.100* :  things should continue like this, don't know what will happen the next day. And the funniest part,
*23:46.100- 23:51.280* :  the government is using their machinery to fight the citizens. I am Victor Okis,
*23:51.560- 23:58.820* :  Obama. School fees are going up. Full stuff are going up. There's hardly anything that the price
*23:58.820- 24:04.160* :  is not skyrocketing. There's hunger in the land. Falling in my car is a problem since the drop,
*24:04.160- 24:10.140* :  the first subsidies, the price of fuel has calculated. That is why there is protests all over the
*24:10.140- 24:15.700* :  place. If prices are not skyrocketing, nobody will go on the street to protest. They are living
*24:15.700- 24:18.240* :  in hunger and you are so president, this is not good enough.
*24:18.980- 24:24.900* :  And Ketchi Okbona is the BBC's senior reporter who covers West Africa for us. She told Rob Young,
*24:24.900- 24:31.400* :  what happened when some wrongs went on sale in Lagos? The customs service decided to
*24:32.060- 24:39.160* :  auction some bags of rice in its custody. Now these are bags of rice that were smuggled into
*24:39.160- 24:45.640* :  the country and were seized. Normally the customs would burn or destroy these goods but they
*24:45.640- 24:55.040* :  decided to auction them for about 25 kilogram bags to Nigerians. And so thousands, literally
*24:55.040- 25:02.880* :  thousands of people trooped to the customs office in Yaba, a suburb of Lagos over the weekend
*25:02.880- 25:10.860* :  to try to get a bag of rice. And so there was a stampede that we saw reports that people had
*25:10.860- 25:20.040* :  died following the crowd that was able to be controlled. And so a lot of people rushed
*25:20.040- 25:26.520* :  there just to get a bag of rice. But that just paints the picture of how desperate people are
*25:26.520- 25:31.580* :  for some type of release. And that there have been these calls from some people in the country for
*25:31.580- 25:38.000* :  a return to military rule in Nigeria. So hacked off Are they at the effect? There's many people
*25:38.000- 25:41.800* :  would see it of government policies and the chief of the defense staff has had to come out
*25:42.300- 25:46.720* :  and say the military will not in any way intervene in anybody calling for a coup d'état as an
*25:46.720- 25:52.440* :  enemy of the country. Well, this calls have happened because of what has happened in the region
*25:52.440- 25:58.900* :  generally with sinkholes in nibbling Miley, Burkina, Faso and Niger in the last 18 months.
*25:59.320- 26:06.380* :  And so it is no surprise that a few people have called for this even though this morning we saw
*26:06.380- 26:15.920* :  the Nigerian army dispelling a rumor that the brigade which is the military formation that
*26:15.920- 26:22.640* :  is closest to the presidency had some scuffle earlier over the weekend and they were planning
*26:22.640- 26:27.540* :  on a coup. And the military has just come out to deny that that nothing like that happened
*26:27.540- 26:35.580* :  over the weekend. The BBC is Mkechi Ogbona in Lagos. Now to Sweden and it's been 50 years since
*26:35.580- 26:41.660* :  the country introduced state-funded parental leave designed for mothers and fathers to share
*26:41.660- 26:45.920* :  between them. It was the first country in the world to offer this pioneering policy and it
*26:45.920- 26:50.480* :  gives some surprising lessons for other countries. Miley Savage reports from Stockholm.
*26:51.200- 26:59.460* :  We're traveling back to the 1970s. A decade when Colony V arrived in Sweden, Swedish group Abba
*26:59.460- 27:04.700* :  won the Eurovision Song Contest and tennis star Björn Borut became the first suite to take the
*27:04.700- 27:11.020* :  men's title at Wimbledon. Women's rights movements were growing globally but their ideologies
*27:11.020- 27:15.200* :  entered mainstream politics more rapidly in Sweden than in many other countries.
*27:21.660- 27:27.300* :  Here's former Swedish Prime Minister Oliver Palmer speaking at a party conference in 1972.
*27:28.140- 27:33.520* :  He promised his government would prioritize gender equality and this set the stage for Sweden's
*27:33.520- 27:42.400* :  introduction of shared parental leave in 1974. Welcome to Stockholm University and the Swedish
*27:42.400- 27:47.620* :  Institute for Social Research. To find out more I went to meet parental leave researcher Ilva
*27:47.620- 27:55.220* :  Mulberry. So one of the stated goals was to get fathers more involved in the care work in the
*27:55.220- 28:02.640* :  home, caring for children and at the same time making it possible for mothers to work more and
*28:02.640- 28:10.300* :  go back to the workforce sooner. They introduced a number of reforms and one of them was the parental
*28:10.300- 28:15.920* :  leave that can be shared between them anyway they want. So Sweden became the first country in the
*28:15.920- 28:22.240* :  world to introduce 180 days of parental leave that wasn't gender specific. Whichever parent
*28:22.240- 28:28.640* :  stayed home was entitled to 90% of their salary funded by tax payers. I spoke to a former
*28:28.640- 28:34.820* :  car mechanic who was the first of his friends to take parental leave in 1978 while his wife went
*28:40.540- 28:46.100* :  back to work. My name is Shell and I live in Stockholm, Bergshamra. I am 74 years old.
*28:46.560- 28:52.540* :  My wife Orser was off work for most of the time. I was off work for a month.
*28:52.900- 28:55.900* :  Why did you think it was important to take that month?
*28:57.500- 29:04.020* :  Well, to get closer, to have time off with my child, it was like a completely new thing and
*29:04.020- 29:09.400* :  there was an opportunity to take time off. Shell doesn't think the experience impacted his career.
*29:09.400- 29:14.780* :  He went back to work and picked up where he left off. But he says it wasn't an easy time for
*29:14.780- 29:22.220* :  many employers. I got time off quite easily. You had to discuss it in advance that you would be
*29:22.220- 29:26.900* :  taking time off and then they couldn't really say no because there was the law behind it allowing
*29:26.900- 29:34.480* :  one to take time off. Today, fathers in Sweden use 30% of shared parental leave days. So child
*29:34.480- 29:41.160* :  care still isn't shared equally, but it's a long way from the 0.5% shared in the mid 1970s.
*29:42.180- 29:45.680* :  Maddie's average reporting. Finally, over the last couple of years,
*29:45.680- 29:51.560* :  several spacecraft have landed on the moon from a number of nations. But one sent out by Japan
*29:51.700- 29:57.560* :  late last month had proved to be a bit of a disappointment. It landed upside down. It wasn't
*29:57.560- 30:02.480* :  able to send back more than a few scraps of information. Now though, there's been a surprising
*30:02.480- 30:07.680* :  turn of events. Terry Egan reports. As far as the Japanese Space Agency was concerned,
*30:07.680- 30:13.440* :  that might have been it for its moon lander. Although the craft touched down within 50 meters
*30:13.440- 30:20.420* :  of the location planned, unfortunately, it had landed at an awkward angle so that the solar panels
*30:20.420- 30:27.220* :  it relied on were facing the wrong way. True, when the sun's angle moved, it did show signs
*30:27.220- 30:33.060* :  of life for a couple of days and was even able to conduct a few scientific observations.
*30:33.060- 30:39.220* :  But it soon went to sleep again. And what would the unforgiving lunar night with temperatures
*30:39.220- 30:45.560* :  of more than minus 180 degrees Celsius the craft is far from equipped to deal with? That might
*30:45.560- 30:52.000* :  well have been the end of that. Now though, in a reversal of fortune, after two weeks,
*30:52.000- 30:57.300* :  the vehicle has again made contact with its controllers. A communication was sent
*30:57.300- 31:04.160* :  and a response received. And it's just enough to hope that the craft can now do the job it was
*31:04.160- 31:10.500* :  designed to do, scrutinising the surface radiation and lunar soil. Terry Egan.
*31:12.880- 31:16.380* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
