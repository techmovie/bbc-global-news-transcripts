*01:43.960- 01:47.520* :  He's quite right. This is The Happy Pond from the BBC World Service.
*01:52.240- 01:56.960* :  I'm Jacquie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 17th of February,
*01:56.960- 02:02.560* :  the eight-year-old who became a media sensation after singing in front of tens of thousands
*02:02.560- 02:08.400* :  of people at a rugby international in Dublin. Wenders pressure on Stevie has always delivered,
*02:08.400- 02:13.380* :  so yes, we're very proud of them. We'll hear about the campaign in India to encourage people to
*02:13.380- 02:19.400* :  see waste pickers differently. These people are not just waste pickers, but they are recyclers,
*02:19.400- 02:24.660* :  they are entrepreneurs. Celebrating 10 years of the Africa prize, what the Africa prize has done
*02:24.660- 02:31.180* :  is that it's really shown that innovation happens everywhere. Also in this podcast,
*02:31.180- 02:38.000* :  meet Joe, a man, unafraid of a challenge. It's kind of a chatting of like a midlife crisis,
*02:38.000- 02:42.160* :  like a guide who's 40s doing a marathon, I think. On long distance running, dealing with a
*02:42.160- 02:47.380* :  stammer and learning a foreign language, and a very special Penguin partnership.
*02:52.640- 02:57.120* :  Now whether you're a sports fan or not, there can be something very uplifting about the
*02:57.140- 03:02.480* :  pre-match ceremony of the teams and the crowd united in singing their anthems.
*03:02.900- 03:09.200* :  And ahead of the six nations, Ireland, Italy, rugby match in Dublin, teams, tens of thousands
*03:09.200- 03:15.900* :  in the crowd, audiences at home and on social media were blown away by this eight-year-old
*03:15.900- 03:20.400* :  Stevie Mulroney singing the Irish rugby anthem Ireland's call.
*03:41.060- 03:47.340* :  We spoke to Stevie and first to his dad, Sheamus, about talent, staying calm under pressure,
*03:47.820- 03:52.580* :  and he found fame. He didn't always sound as good as he does now. Let's show
*03:52.580- 03:58.760* :  we say that, but he always was an entertainer from the time he could walk and talk. He was
*03:59.200- 04:05.740* :  doing magician shows, he was singing. He used to sing Johnny Cash and even Queen Freddie Mercury,
*04:05.740- 04:11.220* :  Jackie, and what would happen is if he forgot a word, he would just improvise. And I was always
*04:11.220- 04:17.820* :  amazed at how he used to do that. I will say, any time he's had to perform in public,
*04:17.820- 04:24.240* :  or when does pressure on Stevie has always delivered. So yes, we're very proud of him as you can
*04:24.240- 04:30.200* :  imagine, Jack. I can imagine Stevie, okay, we're getting a picture of you as a born entertainer,
*04:30.680- 04:38.000* :  but that was a big crowd. It would have been easy to have been overwhelmed by just the scale of
*04:38.000- 04:44.440* :  the whole experience. What was going through your head? Yes, I was very nervous because the big crowd
*04:45.260- 04:54.500* :  was very hard, but I got over it when I sang and nerves just went when I got into the song.
*04:54.500- 04:59.140* :  And when you're preparing for something like that, the things that you have to
*04:59.420- 05:06.740* :  to worry about are the tempo and the acoustics because you won't necessarily be hearing
*05:06.740- 05:13.200* :  the same thing that the people at home are hearing, and it's difficult to hear your own voice perhaps.
*05:14.280- 05:21.960* :  And there's just so much going on. In terms of preparing yourself, stealing your nerves, how do
*05:21.960- 05:29.520* :  you do that? Earphones. No, the actual earphones they gave to you help block it out. Didn't you tell
*05:29.520- 05:37.360* :  Jackie the story on that? Yes, the earphones block out all the sound around you, so they'll block
*05:37.360- 05:44.540* :  out the crowd roaring, but when someone's speaking to you, you can't hear them. And after you'd finished
*05:44.540- 05:51.700* :  and you then went and watched the match, you probably didn't have any idea of the sort of
*05:51.700- 05:58.600* :  reaction that was going on online, did you? No, I didn't know anything about online or what was
*05:58.600- 06:05.960* :  happening. I was just enjoying the match and I was very proud of what I did, and I was just enjoying
*06:05.960- 06:13.860* :  the match till Dad started looking it up on his phone, the amount of likes that was coming up.
*06:14.120- 06:18.780* :  I was going to ask you that, Shane, because if you'd had your phone with you, presumably it would have
*06:18.820- 06:22.440* :  started going ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, really fast. There was an immediate
*06:22.440- 06:28.500* :  reaction, wasn't there? Jackie, before I got to sit down, I had already been contact by a television
*06:28.500- 06:34.420* :  crew who wanted to speak to me the next day, and I was just, could they at least let me sit down
*06:34.420- 06:41.580* :  and watch the match? So yeah, it started immediately, and I mean immediately, but a funny story
*06:41.580- 06:46.800* :  where I was actually placed or where I was, I was right at the tunnel as the teams were coming out,
*06:46.800- 06:53.160* :  so I had that fantastic view. However, I could not see Stevie, because he's so small he was behind a
*06:53.160- 06:58.840* :  team, the team, I was able to see the yellow boots from time to time, but I had to look at the big
*06:58.840- 07:05.700* :  screen to see him sing it. So it was interesting. You're offended. You're offended because the
*07:05.700- 07:12.400* :  Robbie players are so tall, they're very tall compared to me as well. So Stevie, you obviously
*07:12.400- 07:19.600* :  are very good under pressure. Offer some advice to anybody who is facing a big performance in front
*07:19.600- 07:24.660* :  of a lot of people, and they're a bit nervous about it. What would you advise them to do?
*07:25.280- 07:34.120* :  Yes, they should sing from their heart, and just try and stay calm, even there's a big
*07:34.120- 07:40.680* :  ground, just close your eyes, and you know, well I was on that field, I taught, I closed my eyes and
*07:40.940- 07:48.180* :  said, okay, this is just the big green field with just a couple of people standing around me.
*07:48.500- 07:53.280* :  That's a really good piece of advice. If you think that you're just talking to one or two people
*07:53.280- 07:59.440* :  who are singing to just one or two people, that's really solid advice. What's it like now, Stevie,
*07:59.440- 08:09.840* :  to be famous? It feels great. It just feels great. Anybody, ordinary people can do extraordinary
*08:09.840- 08:17.660* :  things, if they believe in themselves. Stevie Mulroney, who's eight? We also heard from his
*08:17.660- 08:23.740* :  dad, Shamus, and a shout out to singing coach Alberto, schoolteacher Sylvia Knox, and definitely
*08:23.740- 08:28.420* :  not to forget his big sisters, his little brother, and his mum Carolina. It takes a village.
*08:29.420- 08:34.700* :  Now to India, where a campaign is underway to foster an appreciation of the people who do vital
*08:34.700- 08:40.400* :  but dirty work, picking through rubbish, and as Clair Bowes found out, it starts with a song.
*08:50.500- 08:59.420* :  That happy number, let's have it one more time, 3, 8, 3, 2, 5, not, not, not, not, that is 383
*08:59.420- 09:08.160* :  million, 250,000 kilograms. And that refers to the huge part of rubbish that waste pickers
*09:08.480- 09:14.960* :  prevent from reaching landfill each year in the Indian city of Bengaluru. That's the city
*09:14.960- 09:22.300* :  previously known as Bangalore. So it's this huge pile of stuff which people have thrown away,
*09:22.540- 09:28.320* :  thinking that there's no more use for it, but in actual fact, the waste pickers sort through it
*09:28.600- 09:35.880* :  and find the bits that can be sold or recycled. And this job is mostly done by families belonging
*09:35.880- 09:45.080* :  to a particular cast. I am Indira, I live in Bengaluru. Indira's family are all waste pickers and age
*09:45.140- 09:52.460* :  10 she joined them too, picking through the waste. But people like Indira are not widely valued in
*09:52.460- 09:58.220* :  Indian society. Instead, they often experience discrimination with people regarding them as both
*09:58.220- 10:07.960* :  dirty and untrustworthy. Yes, cast discrimination is still there. People still differentiate between
*10:07.960- 10:15.480* :  upper and lower cast, but aren't we people first? There's a huge campaign going on in the city of
*10:15.480- 10:20.200* :  Bengaluru at the moment and that 10 different organisations are involved. They're looking at all
*10:20.200- 10:27.280* :  aspects of waste pickers' lives, but we are looking at what one organisation, BBC Media Action, is doing.
*10:28.220- 10:35.560* :  I spoke to Radharani Mitra, whose global creative advisor there and she told me the priority for them
*10:35.560- 10:42.860* :  was to try to reframe the role of waste pickers and to remove the distrust and disgust factor.
*10:43.200- 10:48.760* :  There's definitely been a shift amongst the general population of Bengaluru and the fact that
*10:48.760- 10:54.960* :  they now see that these people are not just waste pickers, but they are recyclers, they are entrepreneurs.
*10:55.600- 11:00.680* :  So as well as composing the happy numbers song, they also conducted a social experiment on Facebook
*11:00.680- 11:10.540* :  and this was to connect the general public with waste pickers. So they could understand what
*11:10.540- 11:17.120* :  their lives were actually like and ultimately to understand that they do all this and it's
*11:17.120- 11:22.400* :  super beneficial for the city and this really seems to have struck home. I had a lump in my throat
*11:22.420- 11:26.940* :  because Mahat goes out to these people who are doing things that none of us want to do.
*11:27.640- 11:30.340* :  They also introduced the glam factor.
*11:35.580- 11:41.640* :  With a series of filmed coffee dates with celebrities, now here's Indra, who we met earlier,
*11:42.120- 11:45.700* :  chatting with a famous Indian actress called Bhumi Shetty.
*11:45.780- 11:56.400* :  And Indra says in her everyday life now she's already noticed a change in the way people treat her.
*11:59.320- 12:02.680* :  In the past people used to look at us and move away from us.
*12:03.520- 12:11.140* :  Now the situation has changed. Today I'm invited to places and offer a seat and some water or tea.
*12:11.900- 12:15.800* :  There is definitely a shift in the way people see me which makes me happy.
*12:19.860- 12:23.840* :  Indra ending that report from Claire Bose and you can hear more about that campaign
*12:24.220- 12:27.320* :  in the BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.
*12:28.480- 12:32.780* :  Now it's quite a challenge to move to another country and learn a new language but imagine
*12:32.780- 12:38.600* :  doing it when you have a stammer. Jim Tong did just that when he moved from the UK to Germany
*12:38.600- 12:44.080* :  but if that weren't enough he also decided to run a marathon to help put his speech impediment
*12:44.080- 12:49.140* :  into the spotlight and he spoke to Harry Bly about it. I think after having had six or seven
*12:49.140- 12:55.300* :  years of learning how to speak English and release my vowels and consonants in certain ways
*12:55.760- 13:00.760* :  I have not this training at all in German and German is like a ridiculously consonant heavy language.
*13:02.520- 13:06.300* :  You get words that are just consonant after consonant after consonant and then there's
*13:06.300- 13:13.240* :  compound words that are extremely lengthy and one of the challenges in Berlin as well is that
*13:13.520- 13:18.780* :  if you stumble when you speak German to people they immediately assume you can't speak German or
*13:18.780- 13:25.200* :  that to you or that you're a tourist so they will reply to you in English which also makes it
*13:25.480- 13:30.360* :  more difficult to learn the language as well. And you've gotten to running and you did a marathon
*13:31.320- 13:37.580* :  tell me about that. Yeah it's kind of a classic thing of like a midlife crisis like a Gadi's 40s
*13:37.580- 13:45.520* :  doing a marathon I think because I now stammer all the time in German I've kind of reconnected with
*13:45.520- 13:51.560* :  this part of myself and so I kind of wanted to do this run for the charity stammer which is a UK
*13:51.560- 13:58.800* :  charity to provide help and access for kids and people in stammer. So many people have run the
*13:58.800- 14:02.840* :  London marathon or the Berlin marathon and I was like that's kind of boring how can I make this
*14:02.840- 14:08.640* :  an interesting story so I was like I'll do the original marathon so I decided to run in Athens
*14:08.640- 14:12.500* :  but unfortunately I didn't look at the route beforehand and there's quite a lot of hills.
*14:12.820- 14:20.100* :  Right and how did it go? It went okay it was pretty brutal like 24 degree heat and you run from
*14:20.400- 14:26.220* :  marathon which is like where the Olympic flame is all the way to Athens like uphill from about
*14:26.220- 14:32.960* :  10 kilometres to 32 which was a bit unpleasant pleasant and I just thought loads of pain gel
*14:32.960- 14:37.480* :  would meet up to rub it to my legs but then when you get to the end and you run to Athens and then
*14:37.480- 14:42.260* :  you see the Olympic stadium like the original Olympic stadium everyone's cheering in the street
*14:42.260- 14:47.460* :  like kind of spurs you on for the last few kilometres. Jim Tong and the charity was stammer.
*14:52.420- 14:57.400* :  Still to come in this podcast they did find each other they both were learning to explore
*14:57.400- 15:02.700* :  the colony and the beach but from very different perspectives the poorly penguins that found
*15:02.720- 15:04.040* :  friendship overfished.

*15:44.380- 15:50.040* :  Sean there are so many daily news shows out there. I know sometimes they all sound kind of same
*15:50.040- 15:57.180* :  me and that's why we work hard every day to sound different. Don't believe us? Give it a listen.
*15:58.000- 16:03.800* :  Today explain from Vox hosted by me Noelle King and me Sean Ramis from Join us.
*16:07.140- 16:11.440* :  Follow today explained in your favorite podcast app for new episodes every weekday.
*16:19.880- 16:24.840* :  Remarkable personal stories. Trail is run through my life and run through my story.
*16:24.840- 16:30.740* :  Deep dive documentaries. These children are using their own bags not to carry books but they
*16:30.740- 16:37.740* :  carry the drug markets Sweden on their shoulders and sports but not as you know it. There's this massive
*16:37.740- 16:43.720* :  landslide of myth and somewhere in there is the truth. The BBC World Service tells the world's
*16:43.720- 16:49.400* :  stories search for lives less ordinary the documentary and amazing sport stories wherever you get
*16:49.400- 16:55.660* :  your BBC podcasts. Now something that could potentially eventually help improve the lives of
*16:55.660- 17:01.800* :  millions of girls and women around the world. Endometriosis can cause severe life impacting pain
*17:01.800- 17:07.840* :  as well as nausea, fatigue, sometimes depression and infertility and it can last from girls first
*17:07.840- 17:13.440* :  period all the way through to menopause. Such treatment as there is is usually just about easing
*17:13.440- 17:19.480* :  the symptoms but it can take years for a woman to get a diagnosis. Now Zewig a startup from Leon
*17:19.480- 17:25.820* :  France has developed a saliva test with the help of three French university hospitals. Zewig
*17:25.820- 17:32.960* :  spokesman Andrew Spears says it could be life changing. Endometriosis has a huge impact on quality
*17:32.960- 17:39.460* :  of life. It's actually a disease where there are three teeth figures which one must be aware of
*17:39.460- 17:46.060* :  when we talk about endometriosis. The first is seven years. This is the average time from when
*17:46.060- 17:52.820* :  patients will start feeling symptoms until when a diagnosis is finally reached. The second key
*17:52.820- 18:00.160* :  figure is 40% and that is 40% of patients will have between five and ten consultations until a
*18:00.160- 18:05.820* :  diagnosis is reached and in the third key figure is 25% that's one in four patients will actually
*18:05.820- 18:13.500* :  be operated on in order for a diagnosis to be reached and what we've come up with is a saliva
*18:13.500- 18:22.840* :  based diagnostic tool. So from a simple saliva sample patients will then have a diagnosis which
*18:22.840- 18:28.960* :  will be given they have endometriosis yes or no after a period of time of three weeks rather than
*18:28.960- 18:36.220* :  a diagnostic delay of seven years. Now there are actually three subtypes of endometriosis. There's
*18:36.420- 18:43.200* :  superficial peritoneal endometriosis and this represents about 80% of cases then there's cysts
*18:43.200- 18:49.980* :  which confirm on the ovaries and then deep nodules which infiltrate. The superficial form which forms
*18:49.980- 18:58.660* :  80% of cases is actually the most difficult to detect. So we're now able with over 90
*18:58.660- 19:05.920* :  5% accuracy to find this form which is not only the most prevalent but which is by far the most
*19:05.920- 19:13.000* :  difficult to find. What needs to be done next before this sort of test can be made more widely
*19:13.000- 19:22.040* :  available? So the next step is that the saliva based test comes into practice and is introduced
*19:22.500- 19:29.920* :  into National International Guidelines. So today we're no longer asking the question does this test
*19:29.940- 19:38.880* :  work? Is it accurate enough? We're now really working on where best to offer the test to patients
*19:39.980- 19:45.880* :  and it is already available in a number of European countries and countries in the Middle East
*19:46.820- 19:53.920* :  and it is being now rolled out on a global scale. So we really want to make this breakthrough
*19:53.920- 19:59.240* :  available to the largest number of patients which are desperately in need and one must not forget
*19:59.240- 20:04.700* :  that the aim of treatment is to slow down or even halt the worsening of pain to optimize fertility
*20:04.700- 20:11.260* :  management which obviously have a huge benefit on quality of life. Andrew Spears of Zeewig in France.
*20:11.740- 20:17.740* :  For 10 years the Africa Prize has been celebrating and boosting inventors and innovators.
*20:18.220- 20:22.360* :  Since it was set up by the Royal Academy of Engineering it's awarded more than
*20:22.360- 20:27.820* :  one and a quarter million dollars among 150 entrepreneurs across 23 African countries.
*20:28.400- 20:33.720* :  Rebecca Anonchal from Cameroon is an Africa Prize judge. She told us about its impact
*20:33.720- 20:40.160* :  and how inventions are changing the world for the better. The Africa Prize is a prize
*20:40.160- 20:47.320* :  to showcase and celebrate African innovators. There's always this impression that
*20:47.340- 20:53.840* :  innovation comes from the West and then we implement it in Africa. But I think what the Africa
*20:53.840- 21:00.700* :  Prize has done is that it's really shown that innovation can come from the continent. That
*21:00.700- 21:08.260* :  innovation happens everywhere and so what the prize has allowed the world to see is that yes
*21:08.260- 21:14.300* :  there are innovators that are coming out of the African continent that have solutions for Africa
*21:14.840- 21:19.500* :  and have solutions for the world. What sorts of innovations have really stood out for you?
*21:20.600- 21:27.800* :  Oh my god there are so many. I mean I'm just always fascinated and inspired by the amount of
*21:27.800- 21:35.580* :  talent and creativity and ingenuity that comes out from the applicants. For instance we had a
*21:35.580- 21:43.000* :  winner a few years ago out of Uganda that created a device that was able to tell you if you have
*21:43.000- 21:49.220* :  malaria. I'm using sensors without having to take blood which means that it was also reusable.
*21:50.160- 21:56.040* :  So there's a huge variety of innovation. There are some really big numbers aren't there?
*21:56.040- 22:02.560* :  Something like 150 entrepreneurs across 23 African countries generating tens of thousands of jobs.
*22:02.560- 22:11.980* :  It's a lot isn't it? Yes I mean wow it's almost 30,000 jobs created through the innovators that
*22:11.980- 22:17.280* :  were finalists in the Africa Prize. That's tremendous. It makes a difference especially when you know
*22:17.740- 22:26.700* :  that in Africa one job feeds up to 20 people and so the impact is huge and so the Africa prize is like
*22:26.700- 22:33.480* :  this support that not just is giving you funding because we have a whole mentorship program
*22:34.180- 22:39.880* :  to help them really create more of a business from this idea or this product that they have.
*22:41.060- 22:45.480* :  Now applications for the next cohort of the Africa Prize for engineering innovation
*22:45.920- 22:52.620* :  will be opening spring 2024 fairly soon just between us Rebecca. What are you looking for?
*22:53.640- 23:01.620* :  Oh my goodness I just love creativity. I love the ability to demonstrate real engineering skills
*23:02.520- 23:09.800* :  and looking at how impactful the product can be in your community and for the world. You know I
*23:09.800- 23:14.960* :  love to see innovators that are thinking not just about their local markets but are thinking about
*23:15.380- 23:20.680* :  how their innovation can be applicable to problems across the world and we've seen this.
*23:20.680- 23:27.600* :  The winner of this year the innovation which is basically a hub that people can come and get
*23:27.600- 23:32.300* :  their medication from without having to go into a pharmacy without having to go into clinic.
*23:32.780- 23:39.720* :  So they get a code to their phone and they can then just go and pick up their medication when
*23:39.720- 23:46.500* :  they have the time to do so. That is not innovation that's unique to Africa. That's something that
*23:46.820- 23:54.400* :  I know that even in London during the discussions when the prize was announced they're like hey I
*23:54.400- 24:01.400* :  would love that too. So I think that that's what we're looking for people that are creative
*24:02.100- 24:08.340* :  that really want to build a business that will have an impact on the lives of people across the
*24:08.340- 24:15.400* :  world. Rebecca Anon Chong from Cameroon. Now life can be hard for a partially cited penguin.
*24:15.980- 24:20.400* :  Indeed an African penguin called squid used to struggle to find the fish at feeding time
*24:20.400- 24:26.460* :  after developing cataracts as a chick. But this is the happy pod and this is the story about how she
*24:26.460- 24:32.260* :  found a penguin friend to help her. Polly Brahman of Birdworld in the UK told us about squid.
*24:32.820- 24:37.940* :  She's probably one of the smallest penguins we've got in our African penguin colony but she's
*24:38.040- 24:44.520* :  a big personality. There's no two ways about that one and if she was fully cited I don't know what
*24:44.520- 24:49.020* :  kind of terror she'd be on the beach but yeah she's got this condition of cataract which affects
*24:49.080- 24:56.700* :  both her eyes so she's got some vision but she's not very good at being accurate and that's the
*24:56.700- 25:03.160* :  factor that has the most impact for her because she has to be accurate when it comes to taking fish
*25:03.460- 25:09.420* :  from the keepers or picking up fish and she can't pinpoint it so that's where penguin comes in.
*25:10.260- 25:14.760* :  Please, please let me just interrupt you here. Her friend is called penguin who is a penguin?
*25:14.760- 25:18.120* :  Yes. You did not put a great deal of imagination into his name did you?
*25:18.120- 25:24.400* :  Yes, it is a bit of a superstition that keepers have. So with penguin he was so sick as a little
*25:24.440- 25:30.400* :  chick and had to be on a lot of antibiotics and he had to be hand raised so he was going through
*25:30.400- 25:35.820* :  an awful lot so the whole time we're just referring to him as the penguin because you know we didn't
*25:36.600- 25:42.660* :  could drink it and give him a name and then it was all going to go wrong. So meanwhile the keepers
*25:42.660- 25:46.880* :  are building up this lovely long list of potential names for this wonderful penguin when he
*25:46.880- 25:54.020* :  finally makes it and when he is out of the woods all he answers to is penguin so we tried various
*25:54.020- 25:57.780* :  names but that was it was not going to happen you go on the beach and you pull penguin and he knows
*25:59.120- 26:03.920* :  so we're stuck. So both squid and penguin have been through quite difficult times but they
*26:03.920- 26:09.540* :  found each other. How does penguin help squid out? They did find each other whilst penguin was going
*26:09.540- 26:15.760* :  through his struggles as a very sickly hand-reared chick squid was out under mum and dad in the nest
*26:15.880- 26:20.520* :  on the beach and it was only sort of as she started to explore and leave the nest that we could see
*26:20.520- 26:25.840* :  the impact of this problem with her vision. So she you know she grew up with the sounds and the
*26:25.840- 26:30.840* :  bustle of the colony we've got you know over 50 penguins and that for her is normal life whereas
*26:31.120- 26:37.900* :  for penguin he was very much cotton wrapped and cared for and we would have to take him out into
*26:37.900- 26:43.180* :  the colony for just very small sessions at a time to build up his his resilience because he was
*26:43.180- 26:49.620* :  terrified of everything going on out there. So they both were learning to explore the colony in the
*26:49.640- 26:54.740* :  beach around the same time as each other but from very different perspectives and for both of them
*26:54.740- 27:00.560* :  the important factor in their day was the keepers coming out to do the feed so they were both drawn
*27:00.560- 27:04.840* :  to this one spot so penguin would come over to the keepers because he thought they were wonderful
*27:04.840- 27:09.580* :  you know he'd been raised by them and he was confident and he kind of he knew how to take the fish
*27:10.320- 27:14.360* :  and squid would come over because it's what she was supposed to do but then she couldn't
*27:14.360- 27:20.260* :  discover how to actually make that contact with the fish herself and of course by then her parents
*27:20.260- 27:25.940* :  are saying no you're you're kind of old enough to do it yourself and so she would then stand by
*27:25.940- 27:32.800* :  the bucket and very quickly this whole scenario developed whereby the keepers would go to feed penguin
*27:33.360- 27:39.280* :  and squid would wait for penguin to be offered a fish and then she would steal it from him as it
*27:39.280- 27:45.720* :  was entering his beaks so she would be like most and most with him so we just play this game of
*27:45.840- 27:50.380* :  feed penguin to feed squid feed penguin to feed squid and penguin doesn't mind
*27:50.380- 27:57.220* :  back doesn't mind at all he he you peck him and she'll tell him to you know hand it over and
*27:57.220- 28:01.900* :  she'll be a right little madam to him and he totally chilled doesn't mind at all
*28:03.760- 28:09.620* :  now Polly you clearly like penguins you must have been quite delighted to see this relationship
*28:09.620- 28:17.640* :  between squid and penguin develop yes yes I I find penguins endlessly fascinating I have a
*28:17.640- 28:24.460* :  huge amount of respect for their fight they're there any a small penguin but they encounter you
*28:24.460- 28:30.560* :  know great white sharks and seals and so much in their natural world that they have to contend with
*28:30.760- 28:37.880* :  and the resilience is incredible so seeing these ones the likes of somebody like squid her approach
*28:37.880- 28:45.280* :  to her disability it doesn't surprise me it's just been fascinating to watch it develop because
*28:45.280- 28:51.640* :  it's not something that we would have predicted equally keepers we've been watching this relationship
*28:51.640- 28:58.480* :  since it started about three years ago and it's now reached a really nice stage of it's solid it's
*28:58.480- 29:04.600* :  there we've been watching it from the get-go and it's it's very gratifying Polly Brahman of Birdworld
*29:08.360- 29:12.720* :  and that's it from us for now if you would like to be part of the happy portal you just want to
