*01:08.240- 01:11.600* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:14.180- 01:18.000* :  I'm Janet Joliel and in the early hours of Monday the 26th of February,
*01:18.000- 01:23.800* :  these are our main stories. Tens of thousands of Brazilians rally in support of the former President
*01:23.800- 01:28.220* :  Jaya Bolsonaro as he's investigated over an alleged coup attempt.
*01:28.960- 01:33.460* :  Israel's Prime Minister says there will be an offensive in the guards and city of Raffa,
*01:33.760- 01:36.380* :  even if a deal is reached to free hostages.
*01:37.300- 01:43.800* :  In a rare admission, President Zelensky reveals more than 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed
*01:44.180- 01:46.860* :  since Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago.
*01:50.100- 01:55.240* :  Also in this podcast, Nikki Haley vows to fight on despite Donald Trump's latest Republican
*01:55.240- 02:00.220* :  primary win, but he says he's now focusing on his opponent in the White House.
*02:00.620- 02:04.620* :  We're going to be up here on November 5th and we're going to look at Joe Biden,
*02:05.140- 02:11.540* :  and we're going to say, Joe, you're fired, get out, get out, Joe, you're fired.
*02:13.160- 02:18.880* :  And Bangladesh gives more protection to its rapidly dwindling population of wild elephants.
*02:23.620- 02:25.560* :  We begin this podcast in Brazil,
*02:29.820- 02:34.440* :  where tens of thousands of supporters of the former President Jaya Bolsonaro have attended
*02:34.440- 02:40.340* :  a rally in Sao Paulo to protest against the ongoing investigation he's facing over an alleged
*02:40.340- 02:46.600* :  coup attempt. Many were wearing the green and yellow colors of the Brazilian flag. Mr. Bolsonaro
*02:46.600- 02:51.820* :  has had his passport seized by police as they investigate whether he plotted a coup to stay
*02:51.820- 02:58.740* :  in power after losing elections in 2022 to the left-wing President Luis Ignacio Lula de Silva.
*02:59.460- 03:04.600* :  Addressing supporters at the rally, he called for an amnesty for dozens of people convicted of
*03:04.600- 03:11.340* :  attacking government buildings in Brazilia in January 2023, shortly after Mr. Lula's government
*03:16.260- 03:21.620* :  took office. Their sentences went far beyond what's reasonable. I can't understand what led
*03:21.620- 03:29.360* :  a small group of judges to give such hard sentences to these poor people who were there on January 8th.
*03:32.620- 03:37.400* :  Our South American correspondent, Ioni Wells, was at the rally where organizers had predicted a
*03:37.400- 03:43.300* :  turn out of half a million. I asked her if their expectations had been met. We don't know if they're
*03:43.300- 03:49.500* :  official numbers, but certainly the crowds that we saw were massive today. The whole of the
*03:49.500- 03:54.480* :  center of Sao Paulo was absolutely rammed with his supporters, very distinctive, as you say,
*03:54.480- 03:58.960* :  because he instructed them all to wear the colors of Brazil so there was crowds of green in
*03:58.960- 04:04.800* :  yellow, kind of flocking to that central avenue in Sao Paulo. Many also brandishing flags with his
*04:04.800- 04:11.060* :  face on it, or slogans in support of him, or what was interesting was the tone of this rally
*04:11.060- 04:15.740* :  was certainly a little more tame than some of them have been in the past. I think that was partly
*04:15.740- 04:22.140* :  because he had instructed a lot of his supporters not to incite further action, for example,
*04:22.140- 04:27.120* :  against some of the Brazilian authorities because of that ongoing investigation into him at the
*04:27.980- 04:33.720* :  moment. And the fact there was such a high turn out does show how divided Brazil is today.
*04:34.800- 04:39.880* :  That's right, even though he is no longer president, even though he is barred,
*04:39.880- 04:45.500* :  falling for office again for another eight years at least, he still is very much seen as the
*04:45.540- 04:52.860* :  figurehead for the right in Brazil. His policies, his whether they be kind of his quite sort of
*04:52.860- 04:59.100* :  strong religious views around family, or whether it be his views on so-called cancel culture,
*04:59.100- 05:05.540* :  or whether it be his anti net zero kind of skepticism of climate change. All of those policies
*05:05.540- 05:11.220* :  do still have a big following clearly as was demonstrated today. But as you say, Brazil still
*05:11.220- 05:16.820* :  does feel like a very polarized country because just a couple of weeks ago when it was the anniversary
*05:16.860- 05:22.860* :  of those riots took place in Brazilia in January last year in support of President Bolsonaro.
*05:23.420- 05:29.660* :  To mark that anniversary, there was a counter protest here in Sao Paulo by supporters of the
*05:29.660- 05:34.840* :  current left-wing president Lula. So there are certainly kind of movements on both sides,
*05:35.500- 05:39.240* :  fiercely divided about what they believe in and who should be running the country right now.
*05:40.300- 05:44.380* :  Ioni Wells in Brazil. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*05:44.380- 05:49.260* :  says his country's planned offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, Raffa, where more than a
*05:49.260- 05:55.940* :  million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, would put Israel within weeks of victory in its war
*05:55.940- 06:02.500* :  against Hamas. In an interview with the American broadcaster, CBS, Mr. Netanyahu said even if a
*06:02.500- 06:08.560* :  ceasefire deal was agreed, which allowed the release of hostages, that would not stop Israel going
*06:08.560- 06:12.940* :  after Hamas' forces in Raffa, it would just delay the offensive.
*06:12.940- 06:19.600* :  But understand, too, that I've asked the army to submit to me a double plan. First, to evacuate,
*06:19.600- 06:26.640* :  to enable the evacuation of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza. And obviously, second, to destroy
*06:26.640- 06:33.840* :  the remaining Hamas battalions, that gets us a real, real distance towards the completion of our
*06:34.140- 06:39.140* :  victory. If we have a deal, it'll be delayed somewhat, but it'll happen. If we don't have a deal,
*06:39.660- 06:45.520* :  we'll do it anyway. It has to be done because total victory is our goal and total victory is within
*06:45.520- 06:51.160* :  reach. Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, assess the significance of the Israeli Prime
*06:51.160- 06:56.880* :  Ministers' words. It is something that he and some of his Ministers have said before. They have
*06:57.100- 07:04.660* :  said, and they want Hamas to believe that they are determined to finish the military job in the
*07:04.660- 07:10.540* :  Gaza Strip. And that means launching an assault on the city of Raffa at some point, where they
*07:10.540- 07:17.080* :  believe that a number of Hamas battalions are still operating. Now, at the moment, there is
*07:17.080- 07:23.740* :  absolutely no sign of the Israeli military preparing the ground for an assault. We have not seen
*07:23.740- 07:29.400* :  any of the things that we saw in Gaza City or Harnunis, the mass leafleting of a city,
*07:30.000- 07:35.180* :  the messaging to telling people to leave, and perhaps equally importantly, telling them where they
*07:35.180- 07:41.260* :  should leave to. None of this has happened, which tells me that there is very little prospect
*07:41.260- 07:48.200* :  of an assault on Raffa anytime soon. And in the meantime, growing, although perhaps still
*07:48.200- 07:54.220* :  slender prospect of some kind of ceasefire deal. And the thinking was that if there was this
*07:54.220- 08:01.180* :  ceasefire deal, that would allow enough space and time for some kind of permanent end to the
*08:01.220- 08:05.420* :  fighting to be brought about. But Mr Netanyahu seemingly is contradicting that.
*08:06.760- 08:14.200* :  Well, it's a question of how much he thinks he can achieve militarily. Clearly, his sense of where
*08:14.200- 08:20.780* :  we go next isn't necessarily the same as the Americans. I think if a ceasefire can be brought about
*08:21.520- 08:27.400* :  before the start of Ramadan in exactly two weeks time, then we are going to see some really,
*08:27.400- 08:34.220* :  really intensive diplomacy to try and turn that temporary ceasefire, which could last a number
*08:34.220- 08:40.800* :  of weeks into something more permanent. And you have to ask the question if a ceasefire can hold
*08:40.800- 08:47.600* :  for as many as six weeks. And we see the steady return of the remaining Israeli hostages.
*08:48.400- 08:54.680* :  Will there really be an appetite to go back to war when that is over? Certainly, the Israeli
*08:54.680- 09:00.860* :  government wants everyone to believe that that appetite is undimmed. But it is, that's quite a
*09:00.860- 09:05.060* :  long way away. And a lot of diplomacy is going to happen between now and then.
*09:05.460- 09:10.360* :  And another key sticking point is about that there are one million displaced people in Raffa
*09:10.360- 09:15.160* :  on top of the population that normally lives there. And all along, the international community
*09:15.160- 09:20.780* :  has been asking, what will happen to these people? This is southernmost city in Gaza. Did Mr Netanyahu
*09:20.780- 09:27.980* :  have an answer to that? No, he still talks in rather vague terms about where people will go. I
*09:27.980- 09:34.480* :  mean, I think the Israeli government knows perfectly well that it cannot assault Raffa,
*09:35.180- 09:40.900* :  which, as you say, is teeming with people, many of whom have left and had to flee places
*09:40.900- 09:46.700* :  multiple times and who are really at their wit's end. To attack a city full of people like that
*09:46.700- 09:52.000* :  would be an absolute catastrophe. The Israeli military knows it, the Israeli government knows it.
*09:52.560- 09:58.440* :  So they have to go somewhere. And that is still an unanswered question. Some have been leaving.
*09:58.440- 10:03.260* :  Some have been heading towards the coast to the area called Al-Mawasi. Others have gone
*10:03.680- 10:10.500* :  up a little bit further north to Dero-Balla. But frankly, there is not enough room to accommodate
*10:10.500- 10:16.920* :  everybody. And that is one of the reasons why I think an assault on Raffa still feels like a
*10:16.920- 10:24.820* :  rather distant prospect. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. In a rare admission, President Zelensky says 31,000
*10:24.820- 10:30.400* :  Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago. At a news
*10:30.400- 10:35.800* :  conference in Kiev, to mark this solemn anniversary, Mr. Zelensky said he would not give the number
*10:35.800- 10:42.540* :  of wounded troops, as this information would help Russia's military planners. After a year of setbacks
*10:42.540- 10:48.300* :  for Ukraine, the Defence Minister said delays in sending Western aid were partly to blame for
*10:48.300- 10:53.240* :  the casualties. Our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse was at the news conference.
*10:54.360- 10:58.740* :  President Zelensky's government held an eight hour press conference in which almost every
*10:58.740- 11:04.700* :  minister spoke. Two years on from the start of the conflict, Mr. Zelensky said 31,000 Ukrainian
*11:04.700- 11:11.540* :  soldiers had been killed, as had an estimated 180,000 Russians. Both figures are likely to be much
*11:11.540- 11:17.320* :  higher. Ministers said half the military aid promised by Western allies was not being delivered
*11:17.320- 11:23.680* :  on time, which was causing loss of life and territory. I asked Mr. Zelensky how he felt about that.
*11:28.020- 11:32.860* :  I am frustrated. Most of the time, it's loss of people. This is my biggest frustration.
*11:33.560- 11:40.660* :  Long war means more victims. Victims can be different, military, civilian, and children.
*11:41.900- 11:46.760* :  And the longer the Russians are on the occupied territories, the more of our children they
*11:46.760- 11:51.120* :  deport to Russia. And the longer the war lasts, the more countries start to hesitate.
*11:53.820- 11:56.960* :  Ukraine's leaders said that if his forces were well armed by Western allies,
*11:56.960- 12:02.040* :  they would win this war with Russia, adding he was confident America would agree an aid package
*12:02.540- 12:06.280* :  to support Ukraine, despite current measures being stalled in Congress.
*12:07.080- 12:11.220* :  Commenting on last year's counteroffensive, the president said the Kremlin had known about
*12:11.220- 12:16.560* :  the operation before it began, but gave no details. James Waterhouse in Ukraine.
*12:17.440- 12:21.400* :  In the battle for the Republican Party's nomination for the US presidential election,
*12:21.400- 12:27.500* :  she's compared herself to David taking on Goliath. And Nikki Haley, despite suffering another
*12:27.500- 12:32.860* :  defeat at the hands of Donald Trump, this time in her home state of South Carolina, is still
*12:32.860- 12:39.160* :  refusing to give up, pointing to the fact that she got around 40% of the vote to Mr. Trump's 60.
*12:39.760- 12:42.340* :  From South Carolina, we'll burn and send this report.
*12:47.800- 12:55.160* :  Another victory, another landslide. Donald Trump's march to the nomination feels unstoppable.
*12:58.640- 13:05.140* :  Speaking at a rally, Mr. Trump didn't even mention his Republican rival. His sights appear to be
*13:05.140- 13:11.320* :  firmly set on the presidential election in November. We're going to be up here on November 5th,
*13:11.420- 13:15.840* :  and we're going to look at Joe Biden, and we're going to look up right in the eye, he's destroying
*13:15.840- 13:23.020* :  our country, and we're going to say, Joe, you're fired, get out, get out, Joe, you're fired.
*13:26.740- 13:31.280* :  I'm standing outside the Trump victory rally at the South Carolina State Fair in Colombia.
*13:32.160- 13:38.200* :  This is yet another resounding win for Donald Trump, who is steamrolling towards victory in this
*13:38.200- 13:43.620* :  primary contest. Here in South Carolina, Mr. Trump was looking to bolster his position as the
*13:43.620- 13:49.520* :  undisputed, unassailable front runner in this race. And that's exactly what he's done.
*13:51.500- 13:55.700* :  He's going to save us from this mess that Joe Biden has perpetrated upon my country.
*13:55.740- 14:00.100* :  Mr. Trump's supporters say this race is effectively over.
*14:00.360- 14:03.040* :  He's going to steal the border, he's going to start drilling the pipeline,
*14:03.040- 14:08.700* :  open up the pipelines, he's going to give us our country back. He can run the government
*14:08.700- 14:13.660* :  from inside the White House on house arrest, we don't care, we don't care, we're voting for him.
*14:13.840- 14:18.300* :  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
*14:19.220- 14:24.720* :  Y'all are a rowdy bunch. Despite trailing Trump by a wide margin,
*14:25.180- 14:28.720* :  Nikki Haley was defiant, vowing to continue her campaign.
*14:28.720- 14:35.180* :  I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run for
*14:35.180- 14:46.700* :  president. I'm a woman of my word. And I felt like the Lord impressed upon my heart that she
*14:46.700- 14:54.780* :  was definitely going to be president someday. Shushop owner Zoe Owen and her husband Sean from
*14:54.780- 15:01.660* :  Columbia are backing Nikki Haley. Sean recently switched his support from Mr. Trump to the former
*15:01.660- 15:08.160* :  governor. Then after New Hampshire and he saw how her friend treated her, he was like, okay,
*15:08.160- 15:13.600* :  I'm off the Trump train. I think it's time for a new leadership, I think it's time for younger
*15:13.600- 15:19.020* :  generation. She's not a demagogue. I think what's going to be interesting is the underdog story.
*15:19.020- 15:25.980* :  America always lights a great underdog. I think she's got that Hutzpah to really take on that fight.
*15:26.100- 15:30.640* :  Why do you think it is that Donald Trump's so popular in, well here in South Carolina,
*15:30.640- 15:37.860* :  nationally as well? So Donald Trump is a celebrity, right? And I think he's become an idol that
*15:37.860- 15:45.520* :  America's ready to tear down. In America, we don't have kings. We don't have people that we bow
*15:45.520- 15:53.820* :  down to. The only person that we bow down to is the one true and living God. Donald Trump is not a
*15:53.820- 16:00.480* :  God and Donald Trump is not a king. King Trump, he is not. But the former president's lead in the
*16:00.480- 16:09.120* :  polls nevertheless is sizable. David Wilson is a political consultant based in South Carolina.
*16:09.120- 16:15.400* :  The flow is going in Donald Trump's direction. I think he has such a ground swell of support.
*16:16.220- 16:21.100* :  It's kind of like the black hole it's pulling everybody in. Mr. Wilson says Haley could remain in
*16:21.100- 16:27.500* :  the race as an alternative. If Mr. Trump's legal problems lead to any nasty surprises in the
*16:27.500- 16:32.520* :  nomination, I think Nikki Haley is kind of like the player who's on the sideline standing right
*16:32.520- 16:38.440* :  next to the coach, hoping that somebody gets injured and gets called and pulled out of the game,
*16:38.500- 16:42.320* :  standing there going, I'm ready to go in coach. I'm ready to go in. Can I go in now?
*16:43.220- 16:48.560* :  But Haley supporters Zoe and Sean Owen say their woman is in it to win it.
*16:48.760- 16:54.260* :  I think if there's going to be a woman president, which there will be one day, you need someone who
*16:54.260- 16:58.560* :  has the tenacity of a Margaret Thatcher. South Carolina's answer to Margaret Thatcher.
*16:58.640- 17:03.640* :  That's right. That report by Will Vernon.
*17:06.600- 17:08.200* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:08.880- 17:13.940* :  In every direction I look, I am surrounded by men wearing next to nothing.
*17:14.260- 17:19.160* :  I think sumo style growing cloths in freezing conditions.
*17:20.140- 17:25.060* :  The ancient Japanese ritual that's finally becoming more inclusive.

*17:41.680- 17:47.060* :  Salads generally for most people are the easy button, right? For me, that wasn't an option.
*17:47.480- 17:51.480* :  Never really was a salad guy. That's just not who I am. But new work for me.

*18:04.100- 18:08.400* :  This is Paige, the co-host of Giggly Squad. And I want to tell you about a company that I've been
*18:08.440- 18:13.540* :  loving. Olive and June. Olive and June gives you everything that you need for a salon
*18:13.540- 18:18.480* :  quality manicure in one box. And if you break it down, it really comes out to two dollars
*18:18.480- 18:23.680* :  of manicure, which is absolutely insane. It's also so easy to get salon worthy nails at home
*18:23.680- 18:28.220* :  with Olive and June. The difference between how your nails used to look when you did them yourself

*19:28.440- 19:33.980* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. Bangladesh has taken steps to stop the exploitation
*19:33.980- 19:39.980* :  of critically endangered wild elephants by ruling against their capture and subsequent mistreatment.
*19:40.420- 19:45.360* :  The high court has suspended the granting of licenses to allow elephants to be reared in captivity.
*19:45.420- 19:51.520* :  Animal rights groups have welcomed the move. They say domesticated elephants in Bangladesh are
*19:51.520- 19:55.600* :  routinely tortured and even killed. Rachel Wright reports.
*19:56.360- 19:59.720* :  Bangladesh was once one of the major homes for Asian elephants.
*19:59.720- 20:05.160* :  Part numbers have been decreasing for decades. As humans encroach on their natural habitat,
*20:05.580- 20:08.360* :  elephants have been forced out of the forest in search of food.
*20:08.800- 20:11.820* :  And when they do, it usually doesn't end well for the elephant.
*20:11.820- 20:18.320* :  Farmers erect electric fences around their precious crops, which can injure and even kill the hungry
*20:18.320- 20:23.540* :  elephant. This has led to the rapid decline in the population of the Bangladesh elephant.
*20:23.540- 20:27.320* :  With only 200 left, they've been declared critically endangered.
*20:27.940- 20:32.480* :  And half of that number are in captivity. It's been the tradition for centuries for
*20:32.480- 20:37.760* :  elephants to be captured for domestic use. Mainly to carry logs or to work in the circus,
*20:37.760- 20:43.760* :  for which the forest department has issued licenses. But Bangladesh's deputy attorney general
*20:43.760- 20:49.480* :  said that the terms of the licenses were being broken and unscrupulous owners were using the animals
*20:49.480- 20:55.260* :  to beg by doorbing them with paint and using them to block passes by to extort money.
*20:55.860- 21:00.140* :  And in circuses, elephant calves were being brutally separated from their mothers,
*21:00.620- 21:03.760* :  shackled for months, and then tortured into learning tricks.
*21:04.220- 21:08.900* :  Recently, pictures of a captive elephant hit by a train have helped animal rights groups in
*21:08.900- 21:14.540* :  their campaign. And after a prominent actress launched a public interest litigation against captive
*21:14.540- 21:20.920* :  elephant licensing, the High Court today suspended all licenses for the capture of elephants from
*21:20.920- 21:26.180* :  the wild. Animal rights groups say they will now try to mobilise support for the rehabilitation
*21:26.180- 21:32.320* :  of all the captive elephants, as has been done in Nepal and Thailand. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's
*21:32.320- 21:37.180* :  forest department are working on a project to maintain the natural habitats for the elephants
*21:37.580- 21:40.060* :  to protect those in the wild from extinction.
*21:41.200- 21:46.180* :  Rachel Wright, licking a politician or journalist's phone number in any country would be
*21:46.180- 21:51.420* :  considered by some to be dangerous, but in Mexico with its high levels of drug-related violence,
*21:51.500- 21:55.360* :  it's even more alarming. The front runner in the presidential election,
*21:55.360- 21:59.840* :  Jews Beheld in June, says that she's been delused by hate-filled messages,
*22:00.440- 22:05.720* :  and a son of the current president, Andres Manuel Lopez-Obrador, says his number has also been
*22:05.720- 22:11.580* :  leaked. The front runner for the presidential election, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a close ally of Mr.
*22:11.580- 22:18.240* :  Lopez-Obrador. He's blamed political opponents. He himself has caused an uproar by recently
*22:18.240- 22:24.380* :  disclosing the number of a journalist who was investigating the drug cartels. I got more in the
*22:24.380- 22:29.500* :  story with our America's rich editor, Leonardo Russia. All that's happening in Mexico is in the
*22:29.500- 22:35.420* :  context of presidential elections in June. You have two women are running for office
*22:35.420- 22:40.820* :  and let's say the governing candidate, the main candidate, he's expected to win.
*22:40.820- 22:45.820* :  And you have President Lopez-Obrador, who I think would have liked to run for office, but the
*22:45.820- 22:50.860* :  Constitution doesn't allow reelection. And the New York Times, a couple of weeks ago,
*22:50.860- 22:57.000* :  published a report saying that in his first attempt to become president, he lost. He received money
*22:57.520- 23:02.720* :  from the drug cartels, which is a very serious accusation. The president didn't like that,
*23:03.220- 23:09.480* :  but that was put to rest. And then more recently, just a week ago, we had the New York Times again
*23:09.480- 23:15.880* :  published a report saying that for years, the US investigated Mr. Lopez-Obrador to check if there
*23:15.880- 23:21.380* :  was, he had received millions of dollars from the cartels in his current government since taking
*23:21.380- 23:27.820* :  office in 2018. That's much more serious. And the conclusion of the report was that they couldn't
*23:27.820- 23:33.320* :  find any evidence, basically, he was innocent. The president got furious. And then during a press
*23:33.320- 23:38.820* :  conference, he does a media conference every day. So during this media conference, he showed on
*23:38.820- 23:45.580* :  the screen a request for an interview by the New York Times bureau chief in Mexico. And there
*23:45.580- 23:52.080* :  on the screen, you could see the name and the details, the phone number, email of this journalist.
*23:52.460- 23:58.360* :  And that caused huge basically outrage in Mexico and in the United States, he was accused of
*23:58.360- 24:05.240* :  exposing and putting that journalist in danger, basically. And now we've got the front runner in
*24:05.240- 24:10.960* :  the presidential election, a candidate who's from Mr. Lopez-Obrador's party, saying that she's
*24:10.960- 24:15.660* :  receiving all these messages of hate because her phone number has been leaked and his son is also
*24:15.660- 24:21.060* :  talking about his number being leaked, saying that poses danger to his family. Yes, so what happened
*24:21.060- 24:27.240* :  since then is those who are opposed to the president have then gone online and published the
*24:27.240- 24:33.660* :  details of the presidential candidates and also his son. And again, President Lopez-Obrador was
*24:33.660- 24:38.520* :  furious about that. Now the opposition candidate has also said that her name has been exposed.
*24:38.520- 24:44.880* :  But I think we have to understand that in the context of Mexico. Mexico is the most dangerous
*24:44.880- 24:50.140* :  country for journalists outside any war zone in the world. More than a hundred have been killed in
*24:50.140- 24:57.220* :  the past decade. And by exposing the names, giving that details online, you're putting their lives
*24:57.220- 25:03.700* :  really at risk because the drug cartels, they will target, they will kill anyone who reports on
*25:03.700- 25:11.700* :  corruption and on crime. No, not a Russia. He was once China's richest man. Now the death has been
*25:11.700- 25:17.500* :  announced of thung-ching co at the age of 79. He founded a beverage company in the 1980s,
*25:17.500- 25:22.040* :  rising from poverty to amass a multi-billion dollar fortune.
*25:22.640- 25:27.400* :  12 years ago, he spoke to the BBC about his status as one of China's wealthiest men.
*25:29.340- 25:35.020* :  Lots of people here are still poor, while only a small number are rich. This wealth gap has
*25:35.020- 25:42.740* :  become a huge problem and has triggered social dissatisfaction. I spend less than my workers,
*25:42.980- 25:48.920* :  I believe in a simple life. I give money to charity. So even though I'm rich, I wouldn't be hated
*25:48.920- 25:56.760* :  for it. The rich should earn respect. Our Asia Pacific Elitemy, he risked a reflex on thung-ching
*25:56.760- 26:04.020* :  co's unlikely success. It's the ultimate rags to rich's story. He was born in 1945 to a very,
*26:04.020- 26:10.080* :  very poor family. And when the communist regime got going in the 50s and 60s, he was sent
*26:10.080- 26:15.420* :  actually down to the countryside with millions of others to work with peasants and farmers.
*26:16.060- 26:20.720* :  So a terrible start in many respects to his life. He came back to Hangzhou, a city,
*26:20.720- 26:26.560* :  worked as a salesman and didn't get his start in business until he was well into his 40s.
*26:26.880- 26:33.620* :  Quite late in life, he started off working it as a school, selling ice lollies and drinks to
*26:34.320- 26:40.300* :  students there. He expanded that business. And before very long, he ended up being a billionaire,
*26:40.300- 26:47.500* :  a massive drinks empire. And so he really is a meteoric rise. But also it's a rise which happened
*26:47.500- 26:52.400* :  quite a lot in China. If you remember at the time in the 1980s, China was opening up. Politics,
*26:52.400- 26:58.040* :  economics was changing. The communist party were accepting capitalist foreign investment.
*26:58.800- 27:05.980* :  And so it really offered an opportunity for people like Mr. Tsong. You had 1.3 billion
*27:05.980- 27:11.360* :  customers who had not enough services, not enough goods. And so people who came across,
*27:11.800- 27:15.840* :  like him, started up businesses, often made a killing just as he did.
*27:16.640- 27:22.020* :  Mickey Bristo. Finally, through an ancient Japanese ritual that dates back more than a thousand
*27:22.020- 27:28.140* :  years, Hadaqa Matsuri or the naked festival as it's sometimes known. Thousands of barely
*27:28.140- 27:33.980* :  clothed men huddled together and attempted to drive away evil spirits. But this year there's been
*27:33.980- 27:39.700* :  a big change. For the first time ever, women have been allowed to take part. Shima Khalil was there
*27:39.700- 27:48.480* :  to witness history in the making. It's freezing here in Inazawa, in central Japan. I'm standing
*27:48.480- 27:54.100* :  outside the Konomi-ashinto shrine and the fact that it's really cold matters because in every
*27:54.100- 28:01.920* :  direction I look, I am surrounded by men wearing next to nothing. I think sumo style, growing cloths
*28:02.400- 28:07.200* :  in freezing conditions. I honestly don't know how they're doing it. I'm told they've been provided
*28:08.100- 28:12.660* :  with a good deal of sucking. And every now and then they get showered with very cold water,
*28:12.660- 28:17.320* :  just to make things interesting. The men are jumping, they're chanting, they're huddling,
*28:17.320- 28:23.180* :  clashing. Some are climbing over one another to get to the chosen man. And this man is chosen
*28:23.180- 28:29.500* :  by the shrine. All of this so they can touch him and attract good luck and drive away evil spirits.
*28:29.580- 28:36.540* :  Wasshoi, wasshoi, it's the tent. And I think it's more of them encouraging each other to keep moving
*28:36.540- 28:46.480* :  because it's really cold. It almost means like, let's go, let's go. For centuries this ceremony
*28:46.480- 28:51.440* :  has been off limits to women, until this year. And I won't leave it to your imagination for long
*28:51.440- 28:56.900* :  until you quickly the women are fully clothed and not part of the men's huddle. They're making
*28:56.900- 29:05.020* :  their own offerings in their own dedicated ceremony. Still, this is a historic day. My husband has
*29:05.020- 29:11.140* :  always taken part in the festival and I was always a spectator. I never ever thought I could
*29:11.660- 29:16.520* :  participate. Atsoko Tamako, she is a 56 year old grandmother whose family has been involved in
*29:16.520- 29:21.360* :  this festival for generations. She tells me that her husband and other men in the community are
*29:21.360- 29:28.320* :  supportive, but it hasn't been easy. There were voices who were concerned about it, saying,
*29:28.520- 29:34.580* :  what are women doing in the men's festival? But we were all united in what we wanted to do.
*29:35.380- 29:40.840* :  We believed that God would watch over us if we were sincere. This is the moment
*29:42.240- 29:47.360* :  for making their way to the Shinto shrine to make their offerings. This is something no
*29:47.360- 29:52.740* :  woman in Japan has ever done before. For the first time, more than a thousand years,
*29:53.660- 29:59.220* :  women are now taking part in what a Japan's most famous naked festivals.
*29:59.820- 30:05.260* :  Standing in front of the Konamiya shrine in purple robes, headbands and white shorts,
*30:05.260- 30:09.840* :  the women make their offering and end the ceremony in the traditional bows and claps,
*30:09.880- 30:15.060* :  then the enormity of the moment sets in. The hug each other and cry.
*30:22.880- 30:27.340* :  It's totally exciting. Thank you so much. It was good. It was really good.
*30:28.280- 30:32.080* :  I'm so happy that I could participate the first time as a woman.
*30:33.040- 30:39.200* :  Becoming the first person to do this is so great. These women didn't just break gender barriers.
*30:39.200- 30:44.740* :  They're also keeping the tradition alive. Japan's aging population is a big threat to these
*30:44.740- 30:49.760* :  festivals. This week, another naked festival, held at the Kokuseki Temple in northern Japan,
*30:49.760- 30:53.980* :  said this would be the last one they would hold. There's simply not enough young people to
*30:53.980- 31:00.740* :  keep it going. Japan started this year with an earthquake and a huge fire on the tarmac
*31:00.740- 31:05.680* :  of Hannida Airport. It has now also fallen into unexpected recession, so this good fortune
*31:05.680- 31:10.940* :  ceremony could not be more timely, in the country we'll need all the help it can get from both men
*31:10.980- 31:19.500* :  and women. That report by Shima Kaleo. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new
