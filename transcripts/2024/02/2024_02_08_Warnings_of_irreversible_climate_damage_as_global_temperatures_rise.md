*00:19.220- 00:25.260* :  It tells the story of how my grandfather Charlie Chaplin and many others were caught up in a
*00:25.260- 00:32.180* :  campaign to root out communism in Hollywood. Hollywood Exiles from CBC podcasts and the BBC

*00:38.780- 00:47.040* :  from the BBC World Service. Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is recorded at 14 hours GMT
*00:47.040- 00:52.660* :  on Thursday, the 8th of February. Climate scientists express alarm as for the first time global warming
*00:52.660- 00:57.980* :  tops one and a half degrees for a full year. If we don't do something about it, it's only going to
*00:57.980- 01:02.300* :  increase. It's going to displace more people. It's going to push more people into food security
*01:02.300- 01:08.940* :  crisis. There's so much more impact than what meets the eyes. The only remaining anti-war candidate in
*01:08.940- 01:14.820* :  the presidential election in Russia is blocked from standing against Vladimir Putin and a new round
*01:14.820- 01:21.600* :  of negotiations is taking place in the Middle East. Also on the podcast,
*01:22.160- 01:26.000* :  there have been previous studies that similarly showed people taking this type of drug,
*01:26.000- 01:30.440* :  how to reduce risk of dementia and already somewhere has been done in animals and in humans
*01:30.440- 01:35.480* :  showing how this drug might be helping protect the brain. Signs that Viagra could reduce the
*01:35.480- 01:45.800* :  likelihood of getting Alzheimer's. The Earth has just experienced the hottest January on record.
*01:45.800- 01:52.060* :  In fact, every month since June has been the hottest on record, and we now know the world has
*01:52.060- 01:59.000* :  been an average of 1.5 degrees hotter than pre-industrial levels for a whole year. That 1.5 degree figure
*01:59.000- 02:04.320* :  confirmed by the EU Climate Service Copernicus is significant because it featured heavily in the
*02:04.320- 02:10.640* :  landmark 2015 Paris Climate Talks. All is not lost, but it suggests we are on course to miss one
*02:10.640- 02:16.500* :  of the key goals to limit global warming. Ritu Barudvaj is a UK climate researcher.
*02:17.220- 02:22.920* :  These are irreversible changes, and that is why we need to limit it to this level now,
*02:22.920- 02:29.200* :  because this amount of global warming is already locked in. If we don't do something about it,
*02:29.200- 02:33.320* :  it's only going to increase. It's going to displace more people. It's going to push more people
*02:33.320- 02:39.280* :  into food security crisis, water scarcity. There's so much more impact than what meets the eyes.
*02:39.840- 02:44.080* :  I asked our climate editor Justin Rola just how serious a moment this is.
*02:44.780- 02:48.860* :  Well, Oliver, it's very serious. I mean, it emphasizes the study increase we've seen
*02:48.860- 02:53.860* :  in global temperatures since their kind of pre-industrial period. And when you draw a graph,
*02:53.860- 03:00.180* :  you do see this study increase to this new peak. And as you've said, 1.5 is a symbolic boundary,
*03:00.180- 03:05.980* :  but it's a really important boundary. There was a 2018 UN study which showed that the impacts
*03:05.980- 03:11.960* :  of climate change would be really significantly more severe at two degrees than 1.5. We're already
*03:11.960- 03:17.580* :  seeing really quite dramatic climate impacts around the world. Increasing intensity is obviously
*03:17.580- 03:22.200* :  something we should all be very concerned about. Yeah, I mean, what kind of an increase are we
*03:22.200- 03:27.100* :  heading for if we are already breaching 1.5 degrees? Well, let's just be clear on the breach,
*03:27.420- 03:33.500* :  Paris commitment is a long-term commitment. So we need a decade or so above 1.5 for that
*03:33.500- 03:37.400* :  formally to have been breached. But the climate scientists are saying, look, you know, we're
*03:37.400- 03:42.860* :  nudging up against the boundary already. This year 2024 is likely to be even hotter than last year.
*03:42.860- 03:47.620* :  So another global record temperature, almost certainly the climate scientists say it will be above
*03:48.140- 03:54.380* :  1.5. So it shows just how urgent action is. And when we talk about action, obviously we're talking
*03:54.380- 03:59.200* :  about cutting carbon dioxide emissions. They are, well, let's be clear, they are leveling off,
*03:59.500- 04:04.320* :  largely a result of increasing efficiency of the kind of ways we use energy rather than an actual
*04:04.320- 04:10.120* :  move away from fossil fuels. But we're still at really the highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions
*04:10.120- 04:17.560* :  we have ever been. So there's a huge kind of mountain to descend if we're going to cut emissions
*04:17.560- 04:22.140* :  to zero, which is the point at which or net zero, which is the point at which, of course,
*04:22.480- 04:27.100* :  we would begin to really moderate the increase in temperature or stop the increase in temperature,
*04:27.100- 04:30.140* :  I should say. So there's a kind of huge journey ahead for the world.
*04:30.420- 04:34.420* :  Yeah, and any chance of us reaching that journey, getting what we need done?
*04:35.240- 04:39.720* :  Well, look, I mean, there are kind of, you know, COP28, you heard kind of, you know,
*04:39.720- 04:44.140* :  you heard powerful rhetoric, didn't you, from world leaders about, you know, the need to tackle
*04:44.140- 04:48.320* :  this. But it is tricky. I mean, I kind of took the calculations in the run up to COP28,
*04:48.840- 04:55.660* :  just 2% of all global energy now comes from renewables, only 2% and we talk about renewables
*04:55.660- 05:00.600* :  revolution. And that shows the kind of energy mountain that we need to tackle if we are going
*05:00.600- 05:05.380* :  to reduce emissions. So it's a huge challenge ahead. Our climate editor, Justin Rohlat.
*05:06.420- 05:11.780* :  When he spoke to the BBC last week, after securing the 100,000 signatures he needed to stand in
*05:11.780- 05:16.840* :  Russia's presidential election, but he's scenarioshed in, knew there was a good chance he would yet
*05:16.840- 05:22.140* :  be disqualified. As an anti-war candidate, he would never be allowed to win. The authorities
*05:22.740- 05:27.300* :  do seem to have been rattled by his popularity, with propaganda outlets turning on him.
*05:27.840- 05:32.940* :  Now, as expected, Russia's election commission has said he cannot run against Vladimir Putin.
*05:32.940- 05:37.260* :  Boris Nyezhden said he will appeal to Russia's Supreme Court.
*05:37.680- 05:42.020* :  Now, here is 10 million of people who have gathered here.
*05:42.020- 05:45.300* :  There are tens of millions of people here who are going to vote for me.
*05:45.320- 05:51.500* :  According to all polls, I'm in second place after Putin. And you're telling me about 11 dead
*05:51.500- 05:57.000* :  or incorrect passports. I understand perfectly well that this is a problem in the law itself.
*05:57.900- 05:59.560* :  We will, of course, challenge this law.
*06:00.240- 06:05.860* :  Well, I asked Vitaly Shevchenko, Russia editor of BBC Monitoring, why Boris Nyezhden ever thought
*06:05.860- 06:11.060* :  he'd be allowed to run in the first place? Well, it's the right question to ask,
*06:11.060- 06:18.600* :  Oliver, because given the tight control that the Kremlin has over Russia's electoral system,
*06:19.180- 06:24.320* :  it would be naive to believe that anything is possible in it without the Kremlin's approval.
*06:24.580- 06:30.380* :  So the answer to that, I think, is because he was allowed to try. But it would be equally
*06:30.380- 06:36.300* :  naive to believe that he would be allowed to win, even if he had been allowed to run.
*06:36.300- 06:44.020* :  Because all of this fits the, what's known as the idea of managed democracy, where
*06:44.700- 06:52.100* :  different parties exist, different cadenets exist, but have no chance of threatening Vladimir Putin's
*06:52.440- 06:59.640* :  rule. And the people who, who did, people like Alexei Navalny, during jail, some of them are in
*06:59.900- 07:08.080* :  exile, like Alexei Navalny is most of his supporters, or dead, such as the murdered opposition leader
*07:08.340- 07:17.740* :  Boris Nemtsov. So this was possibly a way of creating an illusion of a multi-party democracy
*07:17.740- 07:24.960* :  without actually threatening Vladimir Putin's rule. Now, Boris Nyezhden was pretty low profile.
*07:24.960- 07:29.400* :  I'll have to confess, I hadn't heard of him until he got those 100,000 signatures. Do you think the
*07:29.400- 07:38.020* :  authorities were taken by surprise by his popularity? Possibly. And the fact that so many
*07:38.020- 07:46.860* :  Russians queued up for hours to leave their signatures in support of his candidacy shows that
*07:46.860- 07:55.680* :  there's a fair amount of support for him. Whether or not the Kremlin was surprised, I think
*07:56.520- 08:02.340* :  it doesn't really matter that much. At the end of the day, what matters is that the Kremlin has
*08:02.340- 08:11.120* :  really effective tools which it can use to stop people, it doesn't really like winning from winning.
*08:11.380- 08:16.140* :  But the fact that so many people were prepared to cue to put their signature down, does that suggest
*08:16.140- 08:23.840* :  that there is a considerable rump of anti-Putin feeling in Russia? There is, because we're almost
*08:23.840- 08:29.100* :  into the third year of what the Kremlin insists on calling this special military operation,
*08:30.200- 08:36.700* :  tens of thousands of Russians, as far as we know, died in this war waged against Ukraine. Of
*08:36.700- 08:42.840* :  course, they're not happy. Of course, they're annoyed. Of course, they want it to stop. And allowing
*08:42.840- 08:51.780* :  them to cue, allowing this candidate to try, it was possibly a very safe way of allowing them to
*08:51.780- 08:58.620* :  vent their anger without endangering the system. Vitaly Chevchenko. We're staying with the war
*08:58.620- 09:03.800* :  in Ukraine. Shame on you is the message from the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to Republicans
*09:03.800- 09:08.960* :  in the United States over their failure to back a bill, including a massive aid package for Ukraine.
*09:09.560- 09:13.520* :  Aeastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford in Kiev has the details.
*09:14.300- 09:18.400* :  Donald Tusk told Republican Senators in the US they should be ashamed of themselves.
*09:18.400- 09:23.020* :  The Polish Prime Minister said that Ronald Reagan, the former Republican US president,
*09:23.020- 09:29.440* :  would be turning in his grave. They are strong words that Ukraine will welcome, but what it really
*09:29.440- 09:34.460* :  needs is the billions of dollars worth of aid that America promised, and that's now blocked by
*09:34.460- 09:40.880* :  domestic political fighting in the US. This is a precarious moment. Here in Kiev officials are
*09:40.880- 09:46.200* :  still hoping a new US deal might succeed, but they are braced for the worst. There's a lot of
*09:46.200- 09:51.300* :  frustration and a lot of talk of broken promises. Sarah Reinsford in Kiev.
*09:52.320- 09:56.540* :  For weeks we've been hearing about negotiations over a possible ceasefire in Gaza
*09:56.540- 10:02.200* :  in return for the release of Israeli hostages. The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has
*10:02.200- 10:07.460* :  insisted a deal can still be done, despite the Israeli Prime Minister rejecting the latest
*10:07.460- 10:14.040* :  proposals from Hamas. An estimated 100 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza after the
*10:14.040- 10:19.560* :  attacks of the 7th of October. Our correspondent Nick Beak in Jerusalem has details of the latest
*10:19.560- 10:24.440* :  discussions. We know, according to a senior Palestinian official who's just been talking to the
*10:24.440- 10:30.660* :  BBC, that a new round of talks are underway in Cairo, and of course Egypt as well as Qatar,
*10:30.660- 10:36.160* :  the Gulf State are really important players in what's happening here. They're basically intermediaries
*10:36.160- 10:42.380* :  in these indirect talks between Hamas and Israel, and this senior Palestinian official has just
*10:42.380- 10:47.640* :  told us that he believes that the negotiations will be very complex and difficult, and that there
*10:47.640- 10:53.360* :  will have to be lots of rounds of talking. Certainly, Anthony Blinken, the United States top diplomat,
*10:53.360- 10:58.380* :  who is still here in Israel at the moment, he believes there is an opportunity for the differences
*10:58.380- 11:06.120* :  between Hamas and Israel to be reached, to be sort of bridged, and that there is room for negotiation.
*11:06.300- 11:11.740* :  The thing is though, if you've watched last night the press conference from Benjamin Netanyahu,
*11:11.740- 11:16.920* :  the Israeli Prime Minister, he was saying that really the hopes of a ceasefire are very low,
*11:16.920- 11:22.820* :  because he's rejected the proposals put forward by Hamas, and he says, in fact, the military
*11:22.820- 11:27.940* :  operation in Gaza will be intensified in the days and weeks to come, so that really is dashed
*11:27.940- 11:33.040* :  any hopes that were lingering last week that we might be moving towards a more imminent ceasefire.
*11:33.540- 11:39.240* :  Nick Beak in Jerusalem. Well, Hamas Massacre in Israel's devastating military response in Gaza
*11:39.240- 11:44.900* :  has led to a surge in violence elsewhere in the region, including cross-border exchanges between
*11:44.900- 11:50.520* :  Israel and the Iranian-backed militia Hezbollah in Lebanon. Our international editor, Jeremy
*11:50.520- 11:58.160* :  Bone, has been to northern Israel and sent this report. We stopped at the checkpoint on the edge of
*11:58.160- 12:04.440* :  Matula, talking to some of the soldiers here, some of whom are reservists. Tell me how far away
*12:04.440- 12:10.000* :  is Lebanon from where we're standing? To the west, this is a quarter of a mile, to the north,
*12:10.000- 12:18.740* :  this can be a half of a mile and then half mile to the east, so we're more or less 300 degrees
*12:18.780- 12:25.120* :  surrounded by the Hezbollah. I mean, today is really wet, there's a lot of fog, so they can't see
*12:25.120- 12:30.480* :  you, right? This is good, so fog is very good for your visit, and you can now walk all over,
*12:30.480- 12:36.360* :  but if the fog is gone, so walk away because we'll probably not going to miss you.
*12:36.460- 12:41.960* :  Did they target you then? Yeah, so they can see into this town. Oh yeah, every house, everything,
*12:41.960- 12:46.700* :  they know the people, they know the faith is, we know what you do, we are after you, they send you
*12:46.700- 12:51.380* :  to a mobile phone, it's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah, we know where you're leaving, we know where
*12:51.380- 12:56.780* :  your kids are, we're going to come after them. What in Hebrew? Did they send in Hebrew or English?
*12:57.100- 13:02.860* :  Hebrew, Hebrew, you don't know the German translation. Can you get worse here? Could you end up having a
*13:02.860- 13:08.060* :  war? I mean a big war, not the war you're having already, it's already a war. Yeah, it's definitely
*13:08.060- 13:15.180* :  can, can turn into a big war and a big war with his allies, it's not like Hamas, a real army.
*13:16.000- 13:21.800* :  By a big war, he means the war for which Israel and his brother have prepared since that last one
*13:21.800- 13:29.920* :  in 2006. If it happened again, Israel could do even worse damage, Gaza style than it did then
*13:29.920- 13:37.540* :  when it killed something like 1300 Lebanese citizens. In 2006, his brother fired around 4000
*13:37.540- 13:44.520* :  missiles, mostly unguided into Israel and more than 150 Israelis were killed. Since then,
*13:44.520- 13:52.740* :  thanks to Iran, his brother has accumulated an arsenal estimated at well over 100,000 missiles,
*13:53.480- 13:59.640* :  many of which can be targeted. On both sides of the border, tens of thousands of civilians have
*13:59.640- 14:07.140* :  been evacuated from their homes. Kirchemoner, a few miles south of Matula, is also almost empty.
*14:10.220- 14:17.340* :  All he bends him on is head of the local ambulance service. He was here in 2006 and all he remembers
*14:17.340- 14:23.040* :  how bad it was then and knows how much worse it could get than it is now.
*14:26.800- 14:30.760* :  Our city has been under rocket and artillery attacks since October the 7th. Thankfully,
*14:30.760- 14:35.140* :  the city's empty, but three weeks ago, I was called to a nearby village after an anti-tank
*14:35.220- 14:38.680* :  missile attack and had to declare the death of the mother and her son.
*14:41.500- 14:47.240* :  We've come to the Golan Heights. The area captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967
*14:47.240- 14:53.980* :  Middle East War, subsequently a next to move not recognized by most of the world. Damascus is
*14:53.980- 14:58.900* :  only about 50 kilometers from where I'm standing. This building used to be a Syrian bunker.
*14:59.280- 15:05.960* :  Now it's a pretty good cafe and I'm with Climb Rocher, who is the head of the local council.
*15:08.700- 15:14.680* :  I believe holding on in staying put is the only way because if there is no people that allows
*15:14.680- 15:21.980* :  this boiler to attack without retaliation. The Americans see this moment potentially as an
*15:21.980- 15:28.840* :  opportunity. They believe that the shock of the war in Gaza might become a springboard
*15:29.200- 15:34.160* :  to enable them to remake the Middle East diplomatically. First thing though,
*15:35.160- 15:38.860* :  let's not get ahead of ourselves. There needs to be a ceasefire in Gaza. Otherwise,
*15:38.860- 15:45.300* :  the future only has uncertainty and danger for all sides. Jeremy Bowen in Northern Israel.
*15:48.580- 15:53.900* :  Still to come on the global news podcast. But this would suggest that there was a significant period
*15:53.900- 15:59.420* :  of overlap between the last Neanderthals and the first homo sapiens in Europe. New research hints
*15:59.420- 16:05.780* :  that we homo sapiens may be a lot older than we thought. And Sherpa say the world's tallest
*16:05.780- 16:09.920* :  mountain is starting to stink because climbers are using it as a toilet.
*16:16.460- 16:18.920* :  Can you set the stage a little bit so people understand what happened?
*16:19.660- 16:25.940* :  In 1969, 14 black student athletes were kicked off their university's American football team
*16:25.940- 16:32.200* :  for planning a show of support against racism. We were really protesting our treatment on the field.

*17:43.760- 17:49.400* :  turned Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote. Our South Asia correspondent
*17:49.480- 17:51.940* :  Samira Hussein reports from Islamabad.
*17:54.700- 17:59.940* :  The moment polls open this morning, all mobile services across the country shut down.
*18:01.540- 18:04.260* :  Despite assurances, communications would not become.
*18:05.620- 18:11.020* :  The government said security was deteriorating, citing yesterday's twin bomb blasts in the
*18:11.020- 18:17.060* :  Balochistan province. But critics say it was just another attempt to stifle the electoral process.
*18:18.320- 18:24.140* :  Shutting off the internet today means that political parties can't share information or even
*18:24.140- 18:30.660* :  get their supporters out to the polls. And with no clear indication of when mobile services
*18:31.000- 18:36.860* :  may be restored, it could have an impact on when and how results come out.
*18:37.520- 18:44.200* :  And finally, none of this alleviates the concerns that these elections may not be free nor fair.
*18:48.120- 18:52.200* :  These elections are fair, assures former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
*18:52.500- 18:57.640* :  He's had the job three times before and is back on the ballot, having just returned to Pakistan
*18:58.140- 19:05.240* :  from self-imposed exile. The last election, when Imran Khan won, Mr. Sharif was in prison.
*19:06.620- 19:10.800* :  This time, it is the cricket superstar turned politician that is in prison.
*19:11.400- 19:17.400* :  Despite his exceptional popularity, he's not on the ballot, disqualified from running. Members
*19:17.400- 19:22.920* :  of his party continue in his absence, running his independence, barred from using the party's
*19:22.920- 19:28.160* :  symbol, a cricket bat. Significant given 40 percent of the population is illiterate.
*19:29.020- 19:34.400* :  Also not on the ballot, but wielding an incredible amount of influence is Pakistan's military.
*19:34.460- 19:40.440* :  It is widely believed winning the military's support almost guarantees a pathway to victory.
*19:41.620- 19:46.340* :  Pakistan is mired in an economic, political, and security emergency.
*19:47.180- 19:52.460* :  Key to the country's success is the government that can rescue it from its current crises.
*19:53.140- 19:59.420* :  Samira Hussein in Pakistan. The biggest mass migration in the world is underway in China,
*19:59.420- 20:04.920* :  as millions of people head home to celebrate the Chinese new year. Saturday sees the start of
*20:04.920- 20:09.660* :  the year of the dragon, which is thought to be the most auspicious of the signs. But 2024
*20:09.660- 20:15.700* :  is forecast to be a year of economic challenges in China, as it struggles to rebound after strict
*20:15.700- 20:18.520* :  Covid lockdowns, as Laura Bicker reports.
*20:47.180- 20:52.860* :  We will get on the 40m train. We are going home to spend the spring festival and visit our
*20:52.880- 20:57.620* :  mom, who is 90 years old. We are all going to be reunited this year.
*20:59.660- 21:06.120* :  I was born in the dragon year. So this year, I bought red clothes and red pants for a
*21:06.120- 21:14.180* :  prosperous and thriving new year. Families are bundled up and loaded up for the long journey back
*21:14.180- 21:20.660* :  to their home towns. Authorities expect 9 billion trips will be made in China over the spring
*21:20.660- 21:28.060* :  festival period, a much needed boost to tourism, as the economy slows. Experts fear this cash flow
*21:28.060- 21:34.700* :  will just be a stopgap, as China's economic challenges are far deeper. Although some travelers
*21:34.700- 21:43.840* :  wear optimistic about the future. I hope China will do more trade with the rest of the world.
*21:44.380- 21:50.220* :  China has been doing great, but we need other countries to actively cooperate to boost the economy.
*21:55.620- 21:59.040* :  But other new year wishes need spiritual intervention,
*21:59.140- 22:04.380* :  smoke from hundreds of incense sticks, cuddle over Beijing's Lama Temple.
*22:06.920- 22:11.640* :  Only a small fraction of the population in China are Buddhist, but many young people have been
*22:11.640- 22:16.740* :  heading to the temple here to pray for a job. Millions of graduates are out of work as the
*22:16.740- 22:21.440* :  economy stutters this dragon year. They are clinging to the hope that will change.
*22:23.260- 22:27.460* :  The economy has been sluggish. You need to have good ideas and the back yourself.
*22:28.440- 22:31.700* :  But bring to the Buddha and the burning uses that will also help.
*22:38.940- 22:45.020* :  Money, big money, says this young lady of her new year hopes echoing the thoughts of many.
*22:47.640- 22:50.540* :  Even the very young have their future in mind.
*22:52.300- 22:56.040* :  I want to get top marks in my exams every time, says this 10-year-old.
*22:58.400- 23:01.820* :  I want to get into a good high school, says this girl who's in grade 12.
*23:05.240- 23:10.420* :  Whatever their dreams for the future at the time now is for food and for family,
*23:10.900- 23:16.720* :  and after years of pandemic restrictions, that's something people here don't take for granted.
*23:17.800- 23:19.780* :  Our Beijing Correspondent Laura Baker
*23:20.720- 23:25.440* :  Remarkable new archaeological research suggested our species might be quite a bit older than
*23:25.440- 23:30.660* :  previously thought. If so, it could mean that for several millennia, our forebears,
*23:30.660- 23:36.380* :  those early homo sapiens, shared the earth with Neanderthals. Two new research papers with
*23:36.380- 23:41.400* :  material from a site in central Germany have updated our understanding of our biological
*23:41.400- 23:47.220* :  inheritance. Professor Chris Stringer is a researcher in human evolution at the Natural History
*23:47.220- 23:52.760* :  Museum here in London. We in the Neanderthals had like a parallel evolution over hundreds of
*23:52.760- 23:58.800* :  thousands of years, us in Africa, them in Europe and Asia, and then about 60,000 years ago,
*23:58.800- 24:05.120* :  we think homo sapiens started to emerge and start to head towards Europe. But we thought that
*24:05.720- 24:11.680* :  our species didn't really get into Europe until about 41,000 years ago, with only a very
*24:11.680- 24:16.200* :  short overlap with the Neanderthals before they disappeared. But this new work from Rannis,
*24:16.200- 24:22.560* :  which looks at a site that was dug nearly a hundred years ago, they've gone back to the site and
*24:22.560- 24:28.780* :  made remarkable discoveries that there were homo sapiens at this site making an unusual stone
*24:28.780- 24:35.320* :  tool industry called the Rannisian, with laurel shaped spear points. So no one knew who made those
*24:35.320- 24:39.820* :  spear points. We didn't know if it was late Neanderthals or early homo sapiens, but the new work
*24:39.820- 24:46.560* :  using DNA has shown that it clearly was homo sapiens there, and a date of 45,000 years. There were
*24:46.560- 24:50.940* :  many forms of humans and people even use that term differently, but yes, I regard them as
*24:51.240- 24:56.220* :  different kinds of humans, and there were at least five kinds around in the last 100,000 years,
*24:56.220- 25:00.800* :  and we're the last ones left. And so obviously one of the big questions is what is that what
*25:00.800- 25:05.240* :  happened to the others? But this would suggest that there was a significant period of overlap
*25:05.620- 25:10.220* :  between the last Neanderthals and the first homo sapiens in Europe, and they coexisted for a period
*25:10.220- 25:14.520* :  of time. They did a bit of interbreeding. Maybe they even shared ideas with each other,
*25:14.560- 25:19.080* :  and what's interesting is these Rannis people were already adapting to very cold conditions,
*25:19.080- 25:23.920* :  and that's surprising too. We thought it took a while for homo sapiens to manage to do that.
*25:24.280- 25:28.680* :  Professor Chris Stringer It is best known for use in the bedroom,
*25:28.680- 25:33.820* :  but Viagro could have another rather important side-effect. Researchers from University College
*25:33.820- 25:40.140* :  London found that men who took such drugs were 18% less likely to develop Alzheimer's.
*25:40.460- 25:45.420* :  Professor Tara Spires Jones is president of the British Neuroscience Association,
*25:45.420- 25:50.860* :  and has been looking at the study. This is a great study, very large and well-conducted with
*25:50.860- 25:55.680* :  looking at over 250,000 men. There have been previous studies that similarly showed people taking
*25:55.680- 26:00.380* :  this type of drug called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, had a reduced risk of dementia,
*26:00.920- 26:05.440* :  and already some work has been done in animals and in humans showing how this drug might be helping
*26:05.440- 26:09.420* :  protect the brain. So it does open the door and make it even more important that we keep following
*26:09.620- 26:12.640* :  this. Professor Chris Stringer I'm fascinated I'm told that what this is called is a confounding
*26:12.640- 26:18.100* :  factor in research. In other words, there may be something else going on. If you wanted to
*26:18.100- 26:22.840* :  control study to check whether it's the pill or the sex life as it were that's making the
*26:22.840- 26:28.560* :  difference to the health of people's brains, is there a way of easily isolating that factor?
*26:29.480- 26:33.360* :  Easily no, but certainly there's a way and the authors of the study propose a great idea,
*26:33.360- 26:38.740* :  which is to follow this up with an actual randomized control trial where you give people randomly
*26:38.740- 26:43.280* :  either the drug at different doses or a placebo. And of course, we'd want to test women and men,
*26:43.280- 26:47.520* :  to be sure that this sort of treatment, which helps your vasculature as well as your sex life,
*26:48.040- 26:51.460* :  can be protective in the brain. So yeah, a randomized control trial would be an excellent way
*26:51.460- 26:56.660* :  of testing. I think what's fascinating about this is the idea of looking at existing pharmaceuticals
*26:57.300- 27:02.740* :  to see whether they can help alongside obviously some very important work to look at completely
*27:02.740- 27:08.500* :  new drugs. Absolutely. So in the field we call that drug repurposing and sometimes you'll get lucky
*27:08.500- 27:12.260* :  and one of the drugs that's already approved for something like, in this case erectile dysfunction
*27:12.260- 27:17.520* :  also is used to treat some type of hypertension, might also be protecting the brain. But as a field,
*27:17.520- 27:21.380* :  we look at both ends, right? We look at whether things that already exist and are already approved
*27:21.800- 27:25.020* :  can help people. And we're also looking at what's happening in the brain at a detailed level,
*27:25.020- 27:28.720* :  so we can develop new, very targeted treatments. So finally, if new studies are needed,
*27:28.720- 27:34.700* :  are we months for a month or probably many years? Oh, years for this. So a randomized trial is very
*27:34.700- 27:38.640* :  expensive and takes quite a long time. So yes, it would be years before we know for sure whether
*27:38.640- 27:43.580* :  this treatment would be a prevention for for dementia. Professor Tara Spars Jones from the University
*27:43.580- 27:49.020* :  of Edinburgh talking to the BBC's Nick Robinson. When climbing the world's tallest mountain,
*27:49.020- 27:54.600* :  it's not just the altitude or Himalayan view that can take your breath away. According to
*27:54.600- 27:59.480* :  Sherpas, Everest has started to stink because of all the climbers going to the toilet on it.
*28:00.040- 28:05.120* :  Now those attempting the mountain or the nearby Mount Lose are acquired by local authorities in
*28:05.120- 28:10.200* :  the Paul to collect their waste in special poo bags, which will be checked on their return to
*28:10.200- 28:16.480* :  base camp. The story was broken by our environment correspondent Navin Singh Hadke. I asked him what
*28:16.480- 28:21.260* :  Everest climbers had been doing with their waste up until now. Well, see, when I speak to
*28:21.260- 28:26.840* :  the operators or the climbers themselves, majority of them, they are using their spaces out there,
*28:27.380- 28:33.240* :  very few individuals or very few groups are using biodegradable bags or the poo bags that you
*28:33.240- 28:38.380* :  mentioned just now. But largely, it's been the open spaces. Now the thing is, you know, there are
*28:38.380- 28:43.720* :  some locations like South Call that's camp four where, you know, it's a very heavily windsept
*28:43.720- 28:49.000* :  location so that no accumulation of snow, that means that barren rocks. And that is where you get
*28:49.000- 28:54.600* :  to see. And that's why these operators at all switches are very concerned. And that's why they're
*28:54.600- 29:01.340* :  making this move. So it just stays there causing a stink. Yes. And then also when I further talk to
*29:01.580- 29:06.200* :  different operators or even the shepherds, what they say is in this current climate, climate change,
*29:06.200- 29:12.020* :  of course, even if it was buried because, you know, where the temperature is a bit high, it kind of
*29:12.020- 29:16.280* :  gets exposed. And also, these are the water resources not to forget for downstream people,
*29:16.280- 29:21.000* :  and they are very worried. Yeah, not pleasant. So what are climbers supposed to do in future?
*29:21.420- 29:26.320* :  So what they're doing is the local authority, that's the Pasang Lamu rural municipality. They are
*29:26.320- 29:32.220* :  now asking people to buy the poo bags if they don't bring themselves and then take them up and
*29:32.220- 29:36.220* :  then bring it back with the excrement. And that will be treated. That will be collected at the
*29:36.220- 29:40.860* :  base camp. And at the base camp, as we know, it's already like, you know, they do use separate tents
*29:40.860- 29:46.160* :  as toilets. And barrels are used to collect and then to dispose somewhere down below the base camp.
*29:46.320- 29:50.660* :  That's exactly where it's going to go. Now the question is, how effectively will the implementers?
*29:50.820- 29:54.580* :  Yeah, will they really be inspecting these poo bags as the climate is returned?
*29:54.960- 29:58.960* :  Now that is the question, because in the past, one after another rules announced by the central
*29:58.960- 30:03.560* :  government, didn't work so well. But in this case, because it's the local authority and they are
*30:03.560- 30:08.080* :  saying that they knew that central government is largely missing on the ground, we will be on the
*30:08.080- 30:13.040* :  ground, we'll be checking, we'll be doing it. Our environment's correspondent, Navin Singh Hadga.
*30:16.220- 30:20.540* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This
*30:20.540- 30:25.340* :  edition was mixed by Callum McClean and produced by Sean Wales, our editors, Karen Martyn. I'm
*30:25.340- 30:27.140* :  Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
