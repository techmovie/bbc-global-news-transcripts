*00:33.020- 00:36.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:38.180- 00:43.140* :  I'm Jeanette Gilliland at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 12th of February, these are our main stories.
*00:43.760- 00:47.180* :  Two hostages in Gaza have been rescued by the Israeli military.
*00:47.180- 00:52.480* :  Dozens of Palestinians were reported killed during the operation. Tributes have
*00:52.480- 00:57.340* :  poured in for the holder of the men's marathon world record Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum,
*00:57.560- 00:59.180* :  who's been killed in a car accident.
*01:01.340- 01:06.740* :  Also in this podcast, how a drop in international funding is having an impact on Ukrainian
*01:06.740- 01:13.200* :  front line. And I didn't like hierarchy, women entrepreneurs hate hierarchy.
*01:14.160- 01:18.500* :  So no, I never thought it would be, ever thought it would be as big as it was.
*01:19.660- 01:24.620* :  The body shop and ethically aware beauty brand with branches around the world is calling
*01:24.620- 01:27.640* :  in the administrators. We look at what went wrong.
*01:32.780- 01:37.660* :  Up until today, the Israeli military had only been able to rescue one of the hostages taken
*01:37.660- 01:45.140* :  to Gaza on October 7th. But that tally has now risen to three. Israel announced on Monday that
*01:45.140- 01:50.420* :  it had freed two men who were being held by Hamas fighters in a residential building in the city
*01:50.420- 01:57.080* :  of Raffa. Idem Bejarano is a son-in-law of one of the men, Louis Ha. He described the moment when
*01:57.080- 02:06.440* :  they were reunited. We saw them in a lot of tears, hugs, not many words, just being together surrounded
*02:06.440- 02:13.500* :  by the family and surrounded by our beloved people that were without us for so long, more than four
*02:13.500- 02:21.020* :  months. We were so happy to see them. I don't know what is the real situation that they are,
*02:22.040- 02:24.520* :  and we wish them good health.
*02:24.800- 02:29.540* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the rescue operation showed military pressure
*02:29.540- 02:35.300* :  was the only way to bring hostages back home. The Israeli military said overnight air strikes on
*02:35.300- 02:41.040* :  Raffa, the heaviest so far over the course of the past few days, provided cover for the rescue.
*02:41.040- 02:46.900* :  The Hamas run health ministry in Gaza that says at least 67 people were killed in the strikes.
*02:47.520- 02:52.780* :  A man whose relatives were among the dead, Ibrahim Hassuna, said they were a long distance from where
*02:52.780- 02:56.800* :  the two hostages were being held and demanded to know why they'd been killed.
*02:59.640- 03:04.700* :  My family members were sleeping. We were displaced from Gaza. We rented a place and we were
*03:04.700- 03:09.540* :  sitting safely. Why did you kill my family while they were sleeping? There are children.
*03:09.540- 03:13.080* :  I've been collecting my family's body parts since the morning.
*03:13.080- 03:18.500* :  They were in parts. I couldn't recognize them. I only recognized their toes or fingers.
*03:19.280- 03:22.860* :  Speaking from the city, which has crammed with more than a million displaced people,
*03:22.860- 03:26.180* :  the head of the UN Office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs,
*03:26.180- 03:29.740* :  Georgios Petro Bulos described the situation there.
*03:30.240- 03:36.360* :  In Raffa, in particular, we are facing displacement of 1.3 to 1.5 million people,
*03:36.940- 03:41.420* :  including the residents that we're already here. Everyone is short of food, clean water,
*03:41.420- 03:46.080* :  health services, sanitation, and even basic room. I mean, let's not forget people are living,
*03:46.080- 03:50.780* :  you know, six families to one classroom at times. And you really see sort of a breakdown
*03:50.780- 03:55.500* :  in what I would call the rule of law here in Raffa as people are just terrified of what may come
*03:55.500- 04:00.960* :  ahead. A correspondent in Jerusalem, Barbara Pletasha told us more about these latest Israeli
*04:00.960- 04:07.240* :  air strikes on Raffa. Well, they were part of a special joint operations force that was sent
*04:07.240- 04:13.560* :  to rescue two hostages held in a residential building in Raffa according to the Israeli Army.
*04:13.560- 04:18.460* :  And that included several different branches of the Israeli security forces. And it also included
*04:18.460- 04:23.940* :  a heavy bombardment according to the Army that was released in order to protect them as they
*04:23.940- 04:29.800* :  departed. But it certainly put residents of the city in a panic because it's one of the most
*04:29.800- 04:34.480* :  intense bombardments they've had. And they thought at the time that it might be the beginning of
*04:34.480- 04:38.760* :  a ground offensive that Israel has been saying it was planning to do. That was not the case.
*04:38.780- 04:43.800* :  But it did end up creating a fair bit of damage. These two mosques and I think more than a dozen
*04:43.800- 04:50.420* :  homes were hit. We've also had dozens of casualties reported. So it was quite a traumatic night for
*04:50.420- 04:55.860* :  people in Raffa. Although here in Israel, people are celebrating the rescue two hostages.
*04:56.260- 05:02.280* :  And what do we know about these hostages? They are older men. Fernando Maraman in his 60s and
*05:02.280- 05:09.280* :  Louis Har in his 70s. They are said to be in good medical condition, which is something that's
*05:09.280- 05:13.780* :  a real relief for their families, because they were held in captivity for 128 days. They're still
*05:13.780- 05:17.880* :  in hospital at Tel Aviv, although they have been reunited with their families and the son-in-law
*05:17.880- 05:23.860* :  of Mr. Louis Har was speaking, talking about a very emotional reunion that had many more hugs
*05:23.860- 05:29.520* :  and tears than words. Now Israel is saying that these overnight airstrikes provided cover
*05:30.040- 05:34.960* :  for the rescue of these two hostages. But these airstrikes have been going on for some days now,
*05:35.440- 05:40.220* :  and the death toll is mounting from them. What's the purpose of this, ahead of this expected ground
*05:40.220- 05:45.180* :  operation? Those who have watched the Israeli military carry out its operations say that it usually
*05:45.180- 05:50.940* :  starts with airstrikes, which is then followed by ground troops afterwards. But yes, it's something
*05:50.940- 05:56.040* :  that is greatly concerning to the many people in Rafa at the moment, and if they have to be moved
*05:56.040- 06:01.100* :  or evacuated as the Prime Minister has said would happen for a ground offensive, it's not clear
*06:01.520- 06:04.940* :  how that could be done effectively, something that Israel's international allies, including
*06:04.940- 06:09.320* :  the United States, are pressing them to explain. As you say, international allies pressing for
*06:09.320- 06:15.940* :  explanation and President Biden also concerned about these airstrikes, is there any sign that Israel
*06:15.940- 06:21.160* :  is heating these U.S. warnings? Well, the American administration had specifically used the phrase
*06:21.160- 06:26.520* :  there should be no ground incursion into Rafa unless there's a proper plan for the security of
*06:26.520- 06:31.440* :  civilians after which Mr. Netanyahu came out and talked about an evacuation plan. I think that
*06:31.440- 06:38.340* :  was at least one response to specific American rhetoric. But in general terms, the efforts by the
*06:38.340- 06:43.920* :  Americans to get the Israelis to lower the tempo of their attacks become more targeted in terms
*06:43.920- 06:49.700* :  of anti-terrorism types of strikes rather than the kind of whole-scale bombardments that we've
*06:49.700- 06:54.420* :  seen that have destroyed so much of Gaza and killed so many people has been very slow-going.
*06:54.960- 06:59.620* :  Barbara Plesasher in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, an appeals court in the Netherlands has ordered the
*06:59.620- 07:04.780* :  Dutch government to halt the delivery of parts for F-35 fighter jets deployed by Israel in its
*07:04.780- 07:10.760* :  bombardment of Gaza over concerns that they could be used to violate international humanitarian law.
*07:10.760- 07:16.340* :  The Netherlands houses a regional warehouse for U.S.-owned F-35 parts that distributes them to
*07:16.340- 07:22.800* :  countries that request them, including Israel. Anaholegan reports. The appeals court judges wrote
*07:22.800- 07:28.280* :  Israel does not sufficiently take into account the consequences for the civilian population when
*07:28.280- 07:34.160* :  conducting its attacks and therefore found that there is a clear risk that serious violations of
*07:34.160- 07:40.300* :  the humanitarian law of war would be committed in Gaza with Israel's F-35 fighter planes.
*07:41.100- 07:46.340* :  A group of NGOs brought the case to block the export of the U.S.-owned aircraft parts from
*07:46.340- 07:50.420* :  a warehouse in the Netherlands. The Dutch Trade Minister is studying the verdict.
*07:51.120- 07:56.160* :  The government could launch an appeal at the Netherlands Supreme Court. This judgment could
*07:56.160- 08:02.120* :  have implications elsewhere as other rights groups may see potential to exert influence on
*08:02.120- 08:08.980* :  the conflict through similar legal channels. Anaholegan. The world of athletics is in mourning
*08:09.080- 08:13.880* :  after the death of one of its brightest stars, the Kenyan world marathon record holder Kelvin
*08:13.880- 08:20.280* :  Kipton, who's been killed in a car accident. He was just 24. He set the world record in the Chicago
*08:20.280- 08:27.240* :  marathon last October with a winning time of two hours and 35 seconds. The man whose record he broke,
*08:27.240- 08:33.180* :  Kenyan marathon runner Ilyud Kipchoggi, was among those to pay tribute to him. As was the sports
*08:33.180- 08:41.760* :  minister Ababu Namwampa. A very dark day for our country, a very dark day for the athletics
*08:41.760- 08:49.520* :  fraternity, both in Kenya and across the world. Really, we are lost forwards for this horrible,
*08:50.360- 08:58.960* :  horrible loss of a brilliant, brilliant young man, was destined to dominate and rule the world of
*08:58.960- 09:05.440* :  marathon running for a long, long time. The former steeple chase world champion Milka
*09:05.440- 09:13.320* :  Jemos said she was devastated. We have all known Kiptumas our best and even he was in our team
*09:13.320- 09:24.360* :  for the Olympics. So we are just in this world as we are nothing. I can just say,
*09:24.360- 09:32.160* :  Pauli, Pauli, Pauli to everyone, Pauli to all. Our Africa sports reporter in Nairobi,
*09:32.160- 09:37.160* :  Celestine Keroni told us what was known about the crash in which no other vehicles were involved.
*09:37.980- 09:43.240* :  Police have released the incident report from the crash which happened on a Sunday night.
*09:43.240- 09:48.300* :  They say Kelvin Kiptum was driving a car that had two other occupants, one of them,
*09:48.300- 09:54.780* :  his coach, Javeha Kizimana, who is a Rwanda's national and a young lady. Now the police say
*09:54.780- 10:00.020* :  that Kiptum lost control of the vehicle. It veered off the road, went into a ditch and hit a tree
*10:00.500- 10:08.000* :  and Kiptum and his coach died on site while the lady was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
*10:08.780- 10:12.400* :  Tell us about Kelvin Kiptum because he came from very humble beginnings.
*10:13.500- 10:19.380* :  Yes, he did come from humble beginnings and he was the breakout star, Kenya's breakout star
*10:19.520- 10:24.700* :  in a very long time. Kenya has not had this kind of a breakout star, especially in marathon running
*10:25.700- 10:30.140* :  for quite a while, almost a decade. So there was a lot of excitement around Kelvin Kiptum
*10:30.140- 10:37.560* :  because he was an athlete who in 2022 ran his first marathon and won and the next year in 2023
*10:37.560- 10:44.480* :  broke the marathon world record and was now talking about trying to run the marathon in under two
*10:44.480- 10:51.400* :  hours, you know, something that has never been done before. Yet in 2018, Kelvin Kiptum
*10:51.400- 10:56.240* :  borrowed a pair of running shoes so he could run his first official athletics event.
*10:56.240- 11:02.180* :  He had come quite the journey and so that endeared him to a lot of Kenya and his back story
*11:02.180- 11:06.540* :  and then he was being seen as this Kenya who could then challenge his compatriot
*11:07.200- 11:12.100* :  eluid Kipchogge who is considered the greatest marathon run of all time by many Kenyans.
*11:12.920- 11:16.920* :  And so these two were in Kenya's Olympic team and eluid had even talked about oh,
*11:16.920- 11:20.400* :  it would be great to, you know, to run with him, to run with his new upcoming star.
*11:21.000- 11:27.640* :  So it's been quite shocking really. You know, the word, if this country
*11:28.380- 11:30.940* :  woke up to a shock that is almost palpable, I can tell you.
*11:31.540- 11:35.500* :  And he didn't really achieve so much. He was just 24. He could have achieved so much more.
*11:36.600- 11:41.420* :  Yes, he could have. And you know, a lot of Kenyans were seeing him as the athlete to take Kenya
*11:41.420- 11:46.420* :  beyond. You know, Kenyans used to athletics stars, but there was something about Kelvin and
*11:46.420- 11:50.740* :  when you speak to a lot of athletics commentators, they say those are fearlessness around him
*11:50.740- 11:56.200* :  when he runs. So I think that is what endeared him as well to just anybody who loved athletics.
*11:57.260- 12:03.380* :  Celestine Karone, it's a sad outcome for a beauty and skincare brand that in the 1980s and
*12:03.380- 12:08.560* :  1990s won legends of young fans for its opposition to testing products on animals and its
*12:08.560- 12:14.000* :  ethical trading ethos. The Body Shop, a common site in many high streets and shopping malls around
*12:14.000- 12:19.760* :  the world, is facing job losses and shop closures. After it was announced, it was appointing administrators.
*12:20.520- 12:26.500* :  The Body Shop was founded by the Environmental Campaigner and Entrepreneur Anita Roddick in 1976
*12:26.780- 12:32.800* :  before she sold it 30 years later. Here she is in 2006 shortly before her death,
*12:32.980- 12:38.560* :  talking about her vision for the business. The word brand wasn't floating around when I started
*12:38.560- 12:44.740* :  and, you know, 30 or years ago, all I wanted was an honorable enterprise. I never even wanted
*12:44.740- 12:50.900* :  a business because for me, a business was seen as a small version of a large corporation and I
*12:50.900- 12:57.360* :  didn't like hierarchy. Women entrepreneurs hate hierarchy. So no, I never thought it would be,
*12:57.360- 13:04.340* :  ever thought it would be as big as it was. But I knew in my DNA, whatever I was going to do was
*13:04.340- 13:09.820* :  going to be iconoclastic and different and I'd be, you know, putting two fingers up at the system,
*13:09.820- 13:15.680* :  whatever the system was. The brand and retail expert Mary Porter's told us what made the Body Shop
*13:15.680- 13:24.020* :  so ahead of its time. She was the first to go out there with an ethically sourced naturally-based
*13:24.300- 13:28.860* :  ingredient. What's so sad about this is we talk about that if this was invented today,
*13:28.860- 13:33.000* :  people would have just been like jumping up and down, you know, because so many people have
*13:33.040- 13:38.060* :  copied it. She was the head of the game and the Green Beauty Landscape has transformed now and
*13:38.060- 13:43.480* :  was sport for choice and there's been so much competition. But it was a mecca of joy and I
*13:43.520- 13:49.120* :  everything that she stood for was what business should be today. You know, she talked about
*13:49.120- 13:54.260* :  business being a force for good and making progress and having effect in the world. And so
*13:54.720- 13:59.200* :  when you bought from the Body Shop, you didn't just buy, which I loved, the white musk,
*13:59.200- 14:04.600* :  odour toilet, which I sprayed every Saturday morning in there, or the shiny bath pearls,
*14:04.600- 14:10.960* :  you bought into a value system that she stood for and you wanted to be part of her gang. Yes,
*14:10.960- 14:15.780* :  it was innovative. It was ahead of the game. It went global. We are talking every city,
*14:15.780- 14:21.340* :  every town you turned out. In fact, I was in Australia over January and there was a Body Shop in
*14:21.340- 14:25.560* :  there and it was packed and heaving. It didn't need to go bust, but I think here's the reason why
*14:25.820- 14:30.720* :  it got bought out by L'Oreal. L'Oreal knows how to use brands. It did not know how to run a retailer
*14:30.720- 14:35.860* :  and so the sole went out of it. You've got a very organized business model, but you didn't get
*14:35.860- 14:40.700* :  the business that was actually speaking to a value system of people anymore. So it sort of
*14:40.700- 14:46.400* :  fell behind for a long while and then sadly, you know, incomes, the private equity people and
*14:46.400- 14:50.680* :  when you start looking at the bottom line and you don't look at actually the process, the vision
*14:51.040- 14:55.600* :  and what made it successful and put that back at the heart, you're in a tricky, tricky path.
*14:55.880- 14:59.840* :  And the sad thing is everybody's jumping on this bound wagon now. We have to look at the way
*15:00.160- 15:05.660* :  that she did business and we've lost one of the greatest brands we've ever seen in this country.
*15:06.880- 15:15.240* :  Mary Portis. Still to come on this podcast, how one member of the victorious Kansas City Chiefs
*15:15.240- 15:20.400* :  team, who also happens to be Taylor Swift's boyfriend, is celebrating his Super Bowl win.

*15:44.560- 15:47.480* :  You hit the campus like wildfire. Some of them was getting death threats.
*15:47.480- 15:52.100* :  Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service tells their story.
*15:52.280- 15:54.460* :  It was a complete surprise that he kicked this off the team.

*16:05.540- 16:10.840* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Ukraine's difficulties in getting more funding out of the
*16:10.840- 16:16.520* :  US Congress are having an impact on the front line. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion,
*16:16.520- 16:21.300* :  fighters in Ukraine rushed to those front lines. A whole nation was mobilized and
*16:21.300- 16:25.940* :  western aid and weapons poured in. Two years on, the headlines have switched to talk of
*16:25.940- 16:31.100* :  blocked funding and ammunition shortage and problems recruiting soldiers. For Ukraine,
*16:31.100- 16:34.760* :  the goal of liberating its territory hasn't changed, but it's our Eastern Europe
*16:34.760- 16:38.860* :  Correspondence Sarah Rainsford reports from Cherkassi in Central Ukraine.
*16:39.660- 16:43.140* :  The price it's having to pay for that is rising all the time.
*16:47.520- 16:50.840* :  These are the patrols many Ukrainian men now dreads.
*16:52.520- 16:56.160* :  Pavlo Zhilin and his team are hunting for draft dodgers because
*16:56.160- 17:01.180* :  Ukraine needs a lot more soldiers. As we were just crossing the square a moment ago,
*17:01.560- 17:06.660* :  a young man saw them coming and swerved a mile wide to avoid them.
*17:07.320- 17:12.060* :  In a nearby cafe, Pavlo tells me how his arm was blown off on the front line
*17:12.060- 17:17.600* :  in a Russian mortar attack. When he recovered, Pavlo wanted to go on serving his country,
*17:18.380- 17:23.500* :  so now he goes out looking for men who can still fight. It bothers him that they're not flooding
*17:23.500- 17:30.440* :  to the front lines anymore as volunteers. There's a full-scale war, but it's still like people
*17:30.700- 17:35.160* :  don't care. We need everyone to come together like they did on the first day.
*17:36.040- 17:41.640* :  The people's hesitancy is not really surprising. When I asked Pavlo about friends who've served with
*17:41.640- 17:48.120* :  him, he tells me there's almost no one left from his company. Everyone's either injured like me,
*17:48.600- 17:49.040* :  or dead.
*17:54.400- 17:59.260* :  When Liliya's son was fighting an up-deaf cup, she couldn't rest until she got a daily text message
*17:59.260- 18:06.140* :  that he was okay, one in the morning and one at night. The family's own town is still occupied
*18:06.140- 18:12.480* :  by Russian forces and said he signed up to fight to help liberate it. Then he was badly injured
*18:12.480- 18:18.020* :  in a mortar attack. But Liliya showed me recent videos of him messing around in a wheelchair with
*18:18.020- 18:25.800* :  his sister in the hospital grounds. She calls his recovery a miracle, but it also terrifies her,
*18:26.000- 18:31.660* :  because Serhi says once he's fully fit, he wants to go back to the front. He says there's not
*18:31.660- 18:37.580* :  enough soldiers there, and his friends need him. Liliya tells me she's praying for the water end
*18:38.200- 18:44.440* :  before Serhi recovers fully. All over Ukraine, the cemeteries are filling up with soldiers.
*18:45.320- 18:53.120* :  I met Ena beside the grave of her son, Vladislav. He was 22, killed by a Russian landmine.
*18:55.640- 18:59.540* :  When I ask Ena what she thinks about the Ukrainian men who don't want to fight,
*18:59.540- 19:04.240* :  she looks at all the graves around us, and she tells me she can't judge them.
*19:05.060- 19:14.320* :  Do you think my son was an afraid? I was afraid too when he went. Everyone is afraid of dying,
*19:14.320- 19:18.300* :  but maybe being enslaved by Russia is scarier.
*19:34.120- 19:41.460* :  In August, 2023, he's walking down this gravel alleyway with graves of soldiers on either side.
*19:42.920- 19:47.680* :  It's when he comes to places like this and you see people crying quietly at the grave size,
*19:47.680- 19:54.480* :  that it really brings home the huge cost that Ukraine is paying in this war, and nobody knows when
*19:54.480- 20:02.780* :  it's going to end. That report by Sarah Reinsford. Now to Brazil, where a senior military officer has
*20:02.780- 20:07.600* :  been arrested for his alleged role in a plan to overthrow the government. Colonel Benado
*20:07.600- 20:13.160* :  Korenete was previously in aid of the former president, Jaya Bolsonaro. Leonardo Russia is our
*20:13.160- 20:20.080* :  America's regional editor. He's been accused of organizing a meeting with some army special forces
*20:20.080- 20:27.200* :  in November 22. There was four weeks after president Jaya Bolsonaro lost the presidential election
*20:27.200- 20:34.160* :  to his left-wing rival, Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva. So, discerno, his accused of holding a meeting
*20:34.160- 20:40.620* :  with his special forces allegedly to plan a coup. So, they would take part, it would be an important
*20:40.620- 20:47.880* :  part of a military coup that would keep Mr Bolsonaro in power and prevent Mr Lula da Silva from
*20:47.880- 20:52.240* :  taking office about a month later. Now, he's one of several members of the military who've been
*20:52.240- 20:58.900* :  arrested in recent days. What's been the reaction to these arrests from Mr Bolsonaro himself?
*20:59.480- 21:04.620* :  Well, when the operation was launched, that was on Thursday. That was a big big thing in Brazil,
*21:04.620- 21:10.380* :  and one of the main things, many people are expecting Mr Bolsonaro to be arrested. There was
*21:10.380- 21:15.280* :  a lot of doubts about that, and eventually the former president was forced to surrender his
*21:15.280- 21:20.580* :  passport so that he doesn't leave the country. Three other people were arrested, all military
*21:20.580- 21:27.500* :  officers, accused of taking part on this big plot that was allegedly organized by Mr Bolsonaro.
*21:28.000- 21:33.320* :  The former president has been speaking to many outlets in Brazil, and he says it's so wrong.
*21:33.320- 21:38.420* :  He might have discussed options during meetings, but he never plotted against democracy.
*21:39.040- 21:44.580* :  What he says is that the left controls the government, that the Supreme Court is hostile
*21:44.580- 21:49.980* :  to the right, hostile to him, and that they did all they could to favor the left-wing
*21:49.980- 21:54.600* :  candidate in the election, and he said something needs to be done, but he'd never meant
*21:54.600- 22:00.640* :  to stage a military coup. We have to remember here that Mr Bolsonaro is a former army captain
*22:01.240- 22:05.620* :  who praised the military government that was in charge in Brazil for 21 years.
*22:06.060- 22:11.300* :  Mr Bolsonaro still has a lot of supporters amongst Brazilians. What do they say? Do they say
*22:11.300- 22:15.980* :  it's a bit of a witch-un? They say that. It's all political. They expect nothing different. They
*22:15.980- 22:22.760* :  say the Supreme Court judges are all sizing with the left-wing government, and he is still popular.
*22:22.760- 22:29.280* :  It has about 30% at least of support, and even if he can't run, his support is very important,
*22:29.280- 22:34.640* :  and it will be decisive in the next elections. We have local elections this year, big sets of
*22:34.640- 22:39.960* :  like Rio, São Paulo, where the political future of possible presidential candidates is going
*22:39.960- 22:46.700* :  to be decided. Leonardo Russia speaking to Nick Miles. The risk of extinction is rising for some
*22:46.700- 22:51.640* :  of the world's migratory species, such as green turtles or African penguins, according to a
*22:51.640- 22:56.800* :  landmark UN report, is the first time a global assessment has been carried out of the great
*22:56.800- 23:03.160* :  explorers of the animal kingdom. Kelly mulch is the lead author of the study. These species are
*23:03.160- 23:10.300* :  wide-ranging from birds to sea turtles to whales, so gorillas, but really it's about understanding
*23:10.300- 23:15.480* :  the key threats to these species, and we found that it's over-exploitation and habitat loss.
*23:15.600- 23:21.000* :  This really shows the importance of taking actions, and really about scaling up our actions to
*23:21.000- 23:27.000* :  address the underlying threats, and to protect, connect and restore the important sites they rely on.
*23:27.780- 23:31.620* :  Our climate and science reporter Esmi Stella told me more about the report.
*23:32.140- 23:36.560* :  This is the first report that's looked across the world at these particular species.
*23:37.560- 23:42.760* :  What it found was that nearly half of the species assessed our facing decline, and actually that
*23:42.760- 23:47.460* :  varies depending on what animal groups you looked at, so they said for fish species it's almost
*23:47.460- 23:53.380* :  all of them are under or at risk of extinction, and the overwhelming reason for that is the
*23:53.380- 23:58.220* :  decline is being driven by human activity, so predominantly it's the excessive hunting and killing
*23:58.220- 24:03.320* :  of animals, whether that's for trade or for sport and leisure, but also things like the expansion
*24:03.320- 24:07.800* :  of our towns and cities, which bring with it noise and light pollution, which has particularly
*24:07.800- 24:13.240* :  big impacts on migratory species who rely heavily on their senses as they traverse across
*24:13.240- 24:17.200* :  different countries. And what were the consequences be of not taking action?
*24:17.540- 24:22.420* :  I spoke to Amy Frankel, who is the human executive secretary to the convention for the protection
*24:22.460- 24:27.300* :  of migratory species, and she said to me that if we don't succeed in telling this around,
*24:27.300- 24:32.900* :  so having a significant difference on preventing this exploitation, we will see extinction.
*24:32.960- 24:38.200* :  She said there are some species in this report that are very much already on the edge of extinction.
*24:38.540- 24:42.340* :  What does this report suggest needs to be done to tackle the problem? Because it's quite a
*24:42.340- 24:46.960* :  difficult one to tackle, given that these species often travel long distances across the globe.
*24:47.300- 24:51.620* :  Exactly, so there are some countries that are new making significant progress and protecting
*24:52.820- 24:56.580* :  animals that live just within their borders, but obviously there's no point doing that if then
*24:56.580- 25:01.240* :  animal was to traverse into another country and the regulations aren't the same. So the key
*25:01.240- 25:06.640* :  message here is that it needs to be a consistent approach across all countries. They've suggested,
*25:06.640- 25:12.480* :  the reports suggest some recommendations, including establishing where the migration pathways are
*25:12.500- 25:17.680* :  for the most at risk animals and kind of creating biodiversity corridors for them. They also
*25:17.680- 25:22.800* :  recommend that countries really look at minimizing physical barriers to the migration of animals
*25:22.800- 25:28.860* :  such as dams. And in fact, countries are meeting today in Uzbekistan to discuss how they might
*25:28.860- 25:33.920* :  begin implementing some of these actions. It's my style art. It's that time of year when people
*25:33.920- 25:38.620* :  across China spend time with their relatives celebrating the Lunar New Year, and this year,
*25:38.620- 25:44.440* :  increasing numbers are pouring themselves a glass of whiskey. Our business reporter Katie Silver
*25:44.440- 25:51.380* :  has the story. For millennia in China, booze has been about Baizhu, a very strong clear liquid made
*25:51.380- 25:57.460* :  with fermented grains, often sorghum. But in recent times, we've seen the growing popularity of alcohol
*25:57.460- 26:03.240* :  from abroad. China is now the world's greatest importer of red wine. And when it comes to the hard
*26:03.240- 26:08.840* :  stuff, whiskey is where the growth is at. Just over a year ago, China's whiskey market was valued
*26:08.840- 26:17.080* :  at $2.3 billion. That's expected to almost triple by 2027. An annual growth rate of 20% each year
*26:17.080- 26:22.420* :  from the Chinese market compared to 4% growth worldwide. It's something whiskey sellers here in Asia
*26:22.420- 26:27.640* :  are looking to capitalize on. I went along to the Maison de Whiskey in Central Singapore to find
*26:27.640- 26:34.260* :  out Jamie Lee heads up the French company's business in Japan, China and Korea. Why has the
*26:34.260- 26:39.260* :  price of whiskey exploded so much? The thing about whiskey is the age is very important. You have
*26:39.260- 26:44.480* :  to wait at least 10 to 20 years to have the result. You have to have this instinct to do this
*26:44.480- 26:49.360* :  collection before everybody do it. The Chinese New Year is kind of like a Christmas in Europe. It's
*26:49.360- 26:54.180* :  like a festive and people want to spend money by a nice gift and have something memorable.
*26:54.220- 26:59.540* :  So whiskey is part of their memory as well. International brands are taking the Maiden China
*26:59.540- 27:05.000* :  route to cater to this growing demand. The French alcohol company, Pernel Ricard, behind such brands
*27:05.000- 27:12.580* :  as Jamison, BVT Gin, an absolute vodka is plowing $140 million into a production base in the Sichuan
*27:12.580- 27:18.300* :  area. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site with mineral water and year-round precipitation,
*27:18.460- 27:24.100* :  perfect conditions apparently for whiskey making. It's a similar story for rival Diagio,
*27:24.360- 27:29.600* :  which opened a plant in December. Diagio and Pernel Ricard are bacheling to be the world's top
*27:29.600- 27:34.600* :  spirit maker and the potential for an emerging market like China makes it a key battleground in
*27:34.600- 27:40.340* :  that fight. Diagio says demand is so strong they're space for everyone. It helps that many young
*27:40.340- 27:45.860* :  people in China are shunning Bayju in favor of less alcoholic international options as Alison
*27:45.860- 27:51.820* :  Moumston from Dai Shu Consulting explains. Diagio doesn't necessarily satisfy some of the modern
*27:51.820- 27:58.920* :  demands of Chinese liquor consumption which include bar hopping and mixology. She says China's
*27:58.920- 28:04.360* :  whiskey consumers are young, highly educated, increasingly female and with money to spend.
*28:04.380- 28:09.580* :  It means international whiskey makers are in high spirits as they look to take a big gulp
*28:09.580- 28:15.940* :  of the market. Katie Silver. The Super Bowl, the climax of the American football season and one
*28:15.940- 28:20.260* :  of the world's most watched sporting events has been won for the second year running by the Kansas
*28:20.260- 28:27.740* :  City Chiefs. They beat the San Francisco 49ers by 25 points to 22 in a thrilling close run contest.
*28:27.740- 28:33.180* :  Nesta McGregor was at the stadium in Las Vegas. Super Bowl 58ers underway.
*28:33.260- 28:39.040* :  America's showpiece sporting event lived up to the hype. The San Francisco 49ers were twice
*28:39.040- 28:45.100* :  on the brink of victory but a last gasp goal by the chiefs sent the game into overtime and then
*28:45.100- 28:50.640* :  a touchdown in the dine seconds set up by their quarterback Patrick Mahomes helped secure the
*28:50.640- 28:56.500* :  victory and back-to-back titles. In the shotgun Mahomes, four man front receiver emotion
*28:56.500- 29:03.200* :  Loisner. He runs and throws caught touchdown. It's caught, caught and caught the ball. The Chiefs of
*29:03.200- 29:11.860* :  One. The Chiefs of One. Got me feeling it. The R&B singer Usher provided the half-time
*29:11.860- 29:16.000* :  entertainment but he wasn't the only celebrity drawing the attention of the cameras.
*29:16.540- 29:21.180* :  Taylor Swift was in the stands, cheering on her boyfriend. Travis Kelsey, the chiefs player,
*29:21.540- 29:27.020* :  she's been dating since September. After the match, Nesta McGregor caught up with Travis
*29:27.020- 29:31.800* :  Kelsey. Congratulations, man. This isn't feeling any different. It does. Man, it feels
*29:31.800- 29:37.100* :  ten times better, man. Adversity. What this team went through. The Naysayers without talking
*29:37.100- 29:41.500* :  about that, man. Just how much more we have coming in the building. You can see how we're enjoying
*29:41.500- 29:46.960* :  this one right now. How much more we have when we talk about it. How will you and your lovely
*29:46.960- 29:51.560* :  pubs start going for him? Be celebrating. I'm pretty sure Vegas is going to roll out the red
*29:51.560- 29:56.900* :  cover. I'm going to be Elvis for a night. Travis Kelsey, they're celebrating a much deserved win.
*29:58.900- 30:03.160* :  And that's all for us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*30:03.320- 30:07.480* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email. The
