*01:09.260- 01:12.760* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:15.520- 01:22.220* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 15th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:22.220- 01:28.100* :  Israel says its special forces have been operating inside NASA hospital in southern Gaza,
*01:28.540- 01:32.760* :  as they say they have credible intelligence that Hamas was holding hostages there.
*01:33.340- 01:37.100* :  Ukraine is redeploying troops around the eastern city of Avdivka,
*01:37.480- 01:39.740* :  as Russian forces continue to make gains.
*01:39.740- 01:45.040* :  And President Biden has said the shooting at the Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City
*01:45.460- 01:49.200* :  should shock and shame Americans into acting on gun control.
*01:52.460- 01:53.480* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:54.120- 01:58.380* :  we knew that Kim Jong-un would be pleased and pleasing the Supreme Leader is a more important thing
*01:58.380- 02:00.100* :  than it comes to dealing with Korea.
*02:00.680- 02:05.600* :  Why North Korea is inviting Russian tourists into the country for a luxury holiday?
*02:11.020- 02:16.660* :  We begin this podcast in southern Gaza where Israel says its special forces have carried out a
*02:16.660- 02:20.280* :  targeted operation inside the main hospital in Han Unis.
*02:28.300- 02:32.260* :  Video footage from the scene shows medics rushing with patients on stretches
*02:32.260- 02:36.400* :  through a smoke-filled corridor while gunshots ring out in the background.
*02:36.400- 02:40.520* :  A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces, Daniel Hagari,
*02:40.820- 02:45.520* :  said they've received information that Hamas had held hostages in NASA hospital.
*02:46.200- 02:51.820* :  We are committed to finding and returning the bodies of those hostages in Gaza.
*02:52.480- 02:56.400* :  We conduct precise rescue operations as we have in the past
*02:56.900- 03:01.660* :  where our intelligence indicates that the bodies of hostages may be held.
*03:02.520- 03:07.220* :  We have credible intelligence from a number of sources including from released hostages,
*03:07.980- 03:12.380* :  indicating that Hamas held hostages at the NASA hospital in Han Unis
*03:13.020- 03:17.080* :  and that there may be bodies of our hostages in the NASA hospital facility.
*03:21.460- 03:25.880* :  Well, we've been hearing quite a lot over the past few days and weeks from NASA hospital.
*03:25.880- 03:31.720* :  I mean, it's essentially from a way that it is described by the medical staff there,
*03:32.380- 03:36.300* :  a place that's been under siege by the Israelis and this morning,
*03:36.940- 03:43.360* :  as the Israeli forces went in, a nurse sent a message saying, essentially describing
*03:43.360- 03:49.820* :  that doctors, medical staff, etc., were all called down by the Israelis to a lower floor,
*03:49.820- 03:54.380* :  they're essentially assembled together. She also said, I haven't seen this on other accounts,
*03:54.380- 04:01.140* :  but saying that dogs would let loose by the Israeli forces and that she described the
*04:01.140- 04:07.640* :  hospitals having been completely stormed. Also, there's been a response from a Hamas spokesman
*04:07.640- 04:13.540* :  to the claim we just heard there from the idea from the Israeli army saying that it's lies.
*04:13.540- 04:19.480* :  I mean, as with so many other things that have been happening in Gaza, we really can't be
*04:19.480- 04:23.180* :  entirely sure either way what's happening. I mean, the Israeli army has time and time again
*04:23.180- 04:28.820* :  when it's gone into hospitals and again, they've made another claim that 85% of hospitals in Gaza
*04:29.380- 04:34.620* :  contain some kind of Hamas activity, some kind of miniature operation there. We receive
*04:35.600- 04:39.720* :  information evidence from the idea after these operations about what's happened,
*04:39.740- 04:45.320* :  depending to some extent on what side people are on, they kind of decide whether they believe
*04:45.320- 04:52.200* :  that or not. It isn't always totally 100% convincing from either side, but what we can be sure about
*04:52.260- 04:58.000* :  is that there was chaos, there was disorder, and there was great fear when the Israeli forces
*04:58.300- 05:04.720* :  went in. And a few casualties as well? Yes, I mean, we heard from early in the morning that at least one
*05:04.760- 05:10.060* :  patient had been killed and several others have been wounded, and we've had reports over the past
*05:10.060- 05:16.360* :  few days that there had been sniper fire from Israelis with people in the hospital and the Hamas
*05:16.360- 05:22.500* :  run health ministry claiming that people had been killed. And this in the context of Israel having
*05:23.120- 05:28.180* :  essentially called on people there, and there are hundreds, potentially thousands of Palestinians,
*05:28.180- 05:33.260* :  displaced Palestinians who have taken refuge there, for them to evacuate. Yesterday there was
*05:33.260- 05:38.820* :  a drone with a loud speaker which called on people to leave Israel, saying that it had made a
*05:38.820- 05:43.380* :  secure route out again contested by people inside the hospital that that was actually the case.
*05:43.600- 05:48.380* :  And very briefly, still no sign the Israelis are backing down on their threat to storm Rafa?
*05:49.200- 05:55.180* :  No, I mean, we had on Wednesday evening, we had the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again,
*05:55.840- 06:02.540* :  despite really growing international chorus of concern over this, saying that he was totally
*06:02.540- 06:07.780* :  committed to it that strong action was needed. Even if there is a pause, he was saying that that
*06:07.780- 06:12.260* :  would happen, saying that he only route to what he describes as complete victory.
*06:13.180- 06:19.640* :  Our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher, we've frequently discussed the jeopardy of delays in
*06:19.640- 06:25.340* :  US military support for Ukraine on this podcast, as the US is dragging its feet, it's already
*06:25.340- 06:30.400* :  hurting Kyiv's forces. That's the warning from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
*06:31.000- 06:37.080* :  The US Senate recently approved military funding worth $60 billion, but it is yet to go through
*06:37.080- 06:42.480* :  the House of Representatives. I've visited United States a couple of weeks ago. I spent a lot of
*06:42.480- 06:48.780* :  time with representatives from both sides of the aisle in the US Congress, and the broad message
*06:48.780- 06:55.080* :  there is broad agreement there for sustained support. And I count on the US Congress to be able
*06:55.080- 07:00.220* :  to reflect that that support in a decision to sustain the support for for Ukraine.
*07:00.900- 07:06.020* :  I spoke to our defense correspondent Jonathan Bill, who's in Brussels. He told me that although
*07:06.020- 07:11.140* :  Jens Stoltenberg expects an American support package, there's no guarantee it will come.
*07:11.920- 07:16.880* :  He's stepping up the pressure, which a number of European countries, European politicians have
*07:16.920- 07:24.480* :  been doing on the US, particularly the House of Representatives, to pass this aid package,
*07:24.480- 07:30.180* :  this latest aid package to Ukraine. I remember until now, the US has been the biggest military
*07:30.180- 07:37.160* :  supplier to Ukraine, but obviously there's been an impasse in Congress. That was broken
*07:37.160- 07:43.760* :  earlier this month by the US Senate, who approved this $60 billion military aid package to Ukraine,
*07:43.760- 07:49.320* :  but it still needs the House of Representatives to do that. Now Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels said
*07:49.320- 07:54.860* :  he expected, expected was the word he used, that the House of Representatives would do the same.
*07:55.020- 07:58.660* :  I think that's no guarantee that they will, because there are a lot of people in the House of
*07:58.660- 08:03.620* :  Representatives from publicans. You share the views of Donald Trump, who do not believe that the
*08:03.620- 08:11.260* :  best use of US taxpayers money is to support Ukraine's war against Russia. That said clearly the
*08:11.260- 08:17.100* :  Senate believes it is and has approved this, but I think it'll be a much more difficult job
*08:17.100- 08:21.280* :  getting it through the House of Representatives. So there will be this continuing pressure you're
*08:21.280- 08:26.600* :  going to hear from both not just Jens Stoltenberg, but European defense ministers who will be
*08:26.600- 08:31.460* :  meeting soon in Munich. Well yes as you say, but there's clearly pressure on the Americans to
*08:31.460- 08:37.580* :  provide more military aid and obviously pressure on the European nations as well. Yes, and one of
*08:37.580- 08:42.660* :  the things they're discussing here in Brussels is how they can ramp up production of ammunition.
*08:42.740- 08:48.460* :  You know the Germans, for example, have just broken ground on building a new factory to produce
*08:48.460- 08:54.700* :  artillery shells, but you know they realize here NATO officials, ones are spoken to, that Ukraine
*08:54.700- 08:59.720* :  is in a difficult position. They are running short of certain types of ammunition, specifically
*09:00.680- 09:06.640* :  artillery shells, one five five shells. They are being given to Ukraine by European countries,
*09:06.640- 09:11.060* :  but not in the same quantities as the US was able to deliver. The US has much higher
*09:11.700- 09:15.420* :  production rates than the European's at the moment. Jonathan Biel.
*09:16.240- 09:21.240* :  And while talks take place in Brussels, fierce fighting continues in the east of the country.
*09:21.720- 09:26.360* :  For months now, Russia has been trying to capture the shattered frontline city of Dyevka.
*09:26.360- 09:31.520* :  Ukrainian soldiers and medics there have been telling the BBC that they're desperate for weapons
*09:31.520- 09:37.820* :  in ammunition and that the city could fall at any moment. A Ukrainian military spokesman has said
*09:37.820- 09:42.740* :  some of his country's troops are being withdrawn from parts of the eastern city to what he called
*09:43.080- 09:47.460* :  more advantageous positions, from there Andrew Harding sent this report.
*09:52.380- 09:55.840* :  Snow is melting fast here. We are driving along a
*09:56.820- 10:04.000* :  pot-hold country road heading towards Dyevka, where the Russians are fighting hard to seize the town.
*10:04.400- 10:07.100* :  We're with the Ukraine's under-tenth brigade.
*10:07.920- 10:13.360* :  I guess we're just driving past the American Bradley armoured vehicle.
*10:14.560- 10:20.200* :  It's a very foggy day, which is in some ways good news. It means the drones can't fly,
*10:20.200- 10:27.380* :  can't spot us. But it also, we're told by the soldiers here, means that Russian infantry can
*10:27.380- 10:32.520* :  launch surprise attacks and do so under cover. So everyone's a little on edge.
*10:36.420- 10:40.520* :  We've stopped on the outskirts of a small village south of Dyevka.
*10:40.820- 10:47.220* :  We have some explosions in the distance. This is where the hundred and tenth have some of their
*10:47.220- 10:53.980* :  artillery pieces and there's a team of five, six Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a small cottage
*10:54.340- 10:56.820* :  to show us the vehicle.
*11:02.100- 11:04.480* :  So these are the last two shells that you have.
*11:09.860- 11:14.860* :  So they've only got two shells left, but they don't have the explosive charges they need to
*11:14.860- 11:19.920* :  actually fire them. So they really are in trouble here in terms of the supplies.
*11:28.040- 11:32.820* :  For today we are out of rounds. The last rounds we were shooting were yesterday.
*11:33.760- 11:37.060* :  And so far we don't know how soon the new ones will come.
*11:37.480- 11:43.200* :  On a normal day when you have enough ammunition, how often do you fire? How many rounds do you fire?
*11:43.580- 11:49.560* :  It was roughly around 80 a day. And now? None today.
*11:51.140- 11:52.320* :  Special occasions, let's see.
*11:58.980- 12:03.960* :  We've come a little further south from the front lines to a small village and to a stabilisation
*12:03.960- 12:13.600* :  centre, a medical centre run by the 47th mechanised brigade. A lot of booms from I think
*12:13.600- 12:15.000* :  incoming fire outside.
*12:19.180- 12:25.160* :  Two-rated soldiers have just been brought in one with a foot injury. The other looks like he's
*12:25.160- 12:31.240* :  taken a bullet or some shrapnel in his arm. Medical team crowding around now, taking up the soldiers
*12:31.240- 12:39.340* :  heavy winter clothes. The younger soldier has been rushed into the, it'll make
*12:39.340- 12:48.360* :  shift operative tests in here. We're looking at this for damage, bones and tissues.
*12:50.720- 12:58.440* :  This is the old man. He's 47. The Vadim and he's got shrapnel too through his right arm, upper arm.
*13:03.800- 13:08.560* :  I was wounded this morning when we were storming in an enemy position. Shrapnel wound.
*13:08.560- 13:12.960* :  It's very tough going in up the Ivka. We don't have enough of the weapons we need.
*13:15.420- 13:20.120* :  What would you say to American politicians who are saying they're not going to give
*13:20.120- 13:29.740* :  more weapons to Ukraine? American politicians should come here, just want to see what it's like.
*13:30.300- 13:34.100* :  Then they'll understand how much blood and sweat it takes to build a peaceful world.
*13:34.100- 13:41.080* :  What happens if you lose this war? If we lose, which I don't think is likely,
*13:41.080- 13:48.480* :  it'll be a bet for the whole world. As you can tell, the shortage of western weapons,
*13:48.480- 13:53.800* :  ammunition in particular is a real worry here, and it's a worry that's likely to increase.
*13:53.800- 13:59.280* :  As Ukraine braces itself afresh Russian offensives here in the Donbass.
*14:00.260- 14:05.900* :  Andrew Harding reporting. To the US now, and President Biden has said Wednesday's
*14:05.900- 14:10.860* :  shooting at the Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City should serve as a wake-up call to
*14:10.860- 14:16.120* :  Americans who shop and shame them into imposing tighter restrictions on firearms.
*14:16.900- 14:20.940* :  Three people are in police custody in Missouri, after at least one person was killed,
*14:20.940- 14:24.400* :  and more than 20 others wounded some of them children.
*14:25.020- 14:30.120* :  Gunfire erupted as fans celebrated the victory of the Kansas City Chiefs in America's
*14:30.120- 14:36.120* :  largest sporting event. Joe Elohoi, a Democratic member of the Kansas House of Representatives,
*14:36.660- 14:40.560* :  was at the parade with her son. She echoed Joe Biden's message.
*14:41.300- 14:46.900* :  Kansas and Missouri are both states that have some of the weakest gun laws in the country, so
*14:47.480- 14:53.460* :  we don't require background checks on all gun sales. We have kind of a gun everywhere mentality
*14:53.460- 14:59.280* :  around here, and you hear time and time again that it's too soon to start talking about this or
*14:59.280- 15:05.260* :  don't politicize it, but at what point do we say it's too late? Max Dutton was reporting on the
*15:05.260- 15:12.080* :  parade for KWCH 12. He told us what he saw. We heard like sounded like fireworks, but I kind of
*15:12.080- 15:17.340* :  knew the sound was not fireworks, and I said I think those are gunshots, and we could see
*15:17.900- 15:21.820* :  a few people running around, but most people were still walking. Since it was such a happy scene
*15:21.820- 15:27.380* :  at the parade, people were not necessarily on edge. They did not have their guard up, and so
*15:27.780- 15:33.220* :  most of the people that we saw within five minutes of the shooting had no clue that within
*15:33.220- 15:37.460* :  feet of them, there were people lying on the ground with the gunshot wounds. We walked down
*15:37.600- 15:43.980* :  and the first person that we saw was a man lying on the ground with a gun next to him,
*15:44.640- 15:48.800* :  blood everywhere. He was carried off onto a stretcher, and then in the next five,
*15:48.800- 15:54.420* :  10 minutes, six or seven other people started to get carried off, and then it just became a mess,
*15:54.680- 15:59.120* :  and so about 15 minutes after this shooting happened, we were still right there on the scene.
*15:59.680- 16:04.680* :  Then it was really chaotic here. We got people finally starting to understand what had happened,
*16:04.680- 16:09.820* :  and people yelling, crying, screaming, and then you see more police presence running
*16:10.400- 16:14.780* :  inside Union Station, so everything happened outside, but then we saw people running inside,
*16:14.960- 16:18.060* :  almost like they were chasing someone inside or going to find someone.
*16:18.240- 16:23.900* :  I made the scene just even crazier than it was already. There are some pictures of the guns
*16:24.640- 16:29.600* :  that we have now seen on social media that people have taken pictures of the guns, so I might
*16:29.600- 16:34.880* :  be something to check out and kind of look into on what types of weapons. I'm not a gun person.
*16:34.880- 16:39.460* :  I don't really know a lot about them, but I can confidently say the gunfire that we heard
*16:40.280- 16:45.640* :  was very quick. It was not just a couple gunshots. There was a lot of like pop, pop, pop, pop,
*16:45.640- 16:51.440* :  a lot of quick gunfire. That's why fireworks has almost more of a rhythmic tendency to it.
*16:51.440- 16:57.660* :  This was not. This was a little more sporadic, but still very, very quick, and police also telling us
*16:57.840- 17:02.820* :  there's one person confirmed that 22 is the last number that I heard of gunshot victims.
*17:03.620- 17:05.760* :  They said all of that happened within one minute.
*17:06.780- 17:11.960* :  Max Dawson, a charity that helps people worried about their own thoughts and behavior,
*17:11.960- 17:18.760* :  is warning that viewing AI-generated images of child abuse makes it more likely offenders will
*17:18.760- 17:25.180* :  move on to sexually abuse real children. Our cyber correspondent, Joe Tidy, told me why the charity,
*17:25.640- 17:28.520* :  the Lucy Faithful Foundation, was so concerned.
*17:29.640- 17:33.340* :  Well, they're saying that they think that the AI-generated images that are sadly
*17:33.340- 17:36.840* :  proliferating now because of the speed and ease which you can use these tools.
*17:37.580- 17:41.940* :  They are sort of leading to a blurring of the lines, the boundaries between ethics and
*17:41.940- 17:46.620* :  legality, and this charity takes phone calls from people around the country, around the world,
*17:46.620- 17:49.720* :  who are struggling with their thoughts about children in a sexual manner.
*17:50.300- 17:53.860* :  And they're saying that they're calling not really understanding whether or not it's wrong
*17:53.920- 17:58.460* :  because the children aren't real. They spoke about one man who was 43 years old and IT worker who
*17:58.460- 18:04.240* :  has since been arrested, and he called up after he was found to have generated images of children
*18:04.240- 18:08.320* :  of a sexual nature, and he said I was just doing it for the technology and the children aren't
*18:08.320- 18:12.780* :  real, so it's okay, isn't it? And the charity had to explain to them, no, any making or viewing
*18:12.780- 18:18.620* :  of a childlike image in a sexual nature is illegal and immoral and they are concerned about this movement
*18:18.620- 18:23.420* :  towards more serious offending. And clearly this is important, but how important is it?
*18:23.960- 18:27.800* :  Well, the charity say that they're seeing a small number of people calling in about these kind
*18:27.800- 18:31.880* :  of thoughts and confusion, but it is increasing. So they're worried that this is a trend that we're
*18:31.880- 18:36.100* :  going to see. And this is kind of a little window into a into the kind of general society,
*18:36.100- 18:41.380* :  because one of the things I've noticed about covering this topic and this issue of AI-generated
*18:41.380- 18:45.860* :  child sexual abuse material is that people say, oh, well, that's not as bad, is it because they're
*18:45.860- 18:51.360* :  not real children? And what we're seeing now is that that mindset seeping into the minds of offenders
*18:51.360- 18:56.960* :  who are potentially finding the stuff on forums of AIR to whatever and progressing into more
*18:56.960- 19:01.580* :  serious images and videos and then potentially even moving on to harming real children.
*19:06.200- 19:11.040* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast. We don't seem to see this in mammals,
*19:11.040- 19:16.500* :  and I think that brings up some cool evolutionary questions that it's really cool that this has
*19:16.500- 19:22.020* :  been documented for the first time in this species. A stingrays puzzling pregnancy.
*19:27.780- 19:32.760* :  Remarkable personal stories. Trail. It runs through my life and runs through my story.
*19:32.760- 19:38.040* :  Deep dive documentaries. These children are using their own bags, not to carry books,
*19:38.040- 19:44.880* :  but they carry the drug markets Sweden on their shoulders and sports, but not as you know it.
*19:44.940- 19:49.120* :  There's this massive landslide of myth and somewhere in there is the truth.
*19:49.120- 19:53.840* :  The BBC World Service tells the world's stories. Search for lives less ordinary,
*19:53.840- 19:58.280* :  the documentary and amazing sport stories. Wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*20:01.900- 20:06.240* :  Two Chinese fishermen have drowned while being chased by the Taiwanese coast guard.
*20:06.240- 20:11.620* :  Taipei said the boat trespassed into Taiwanese waters near Kinman Island on Wednesday.
*20:12.160- 20:16.060* :  So what were they doing there? Our Beijing correspondent Steve McDonald has more.
*20:16.940- 20:21.640* :  In terms of why they were there, let's assume for the moment there were no nefarious purposes.
*20:21.640- 20:26.020* :  No drug dealing. They weren't trying to sneak into Taiwan or anything like that.
*20:26.020- 20:32.480* :  What it appears to be on the face of it was some fishermen who've gone into Taiwanese waters where
*20:32.480- 20:37.440* :  they're technically they're not supposed to be. They're doing this in a speedboat rather than a big
*20:37.440- 20:41.920* :  fishing boat I guess because they can get out of there quickly if anyone spots them.
*20:42.360- 20:46.600* :  Now they were spotted by the Taiwanese coast guard who said to them, well we're going to board your
*20:46.620- 20:52.460* :  ship and have a look at things at that point they took off. According to Taiwanese officials,
*20:52.460- 20:57.380* :  at that point the speedboat turned over, the four of them went into the water. They were able to
*20:57.380- 21:03.100* :  rescue two of the fishermen but two others died. What has Beijing been saying about this incident?
*21:03.460- 21:07.280* :  Well they're not happy with it. They're calling for an investigation. Julf Hongliang,
*21:07.280- 21:13.860* :  there's the spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office. He described this as a malignant incident
*21:13.860- 21:19.140* :  which severely harmed the feelings of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
*21:19.700- 21:24.240* :  It is likely to cause more tension between Taiwan and the mainland but one thing that's
*21:24.340- 21:29.400* :  tempering all of this is that it's a national holiday here. The whole country's on their spring
*21:29.400- 21:34.840* :  festival break. Does this kind of this incident happen often in the Taiwan Strait?
*21:34.980- 21:40.520* :  There have been incidents like this where mainland Chinese fishermen have been chased away by
*21:40.520- 21:47.520* :  the Coast Guard from Taiwan but no one has died in this way. This is what's increasing the tension
*21:47.520- 21:53.060* :  in this particular case and I think it could be that the boat was small. Imagine again I'm
*21:53.060- 21:57.880* :  if they're describing this as a speedboat so it's not like a big fishing boat with nets and the
*21:57.880- 22:04.420* :  like and it's racing off through choppy waters and it's turned over. I think that explains why
*22:04.420- 22:10.080* :  these men have died. China can be outraged about it but the problem is they were
*22:10.080- 22:15.640* :  it looks like in an area which is Taiwanese waters they shouldn't have been there and it seems
*22:15.640- 22:20.040* :  like it to spend an accident which has led to the deaths. Steve McDonald in Beijing.
*22:21.120- 22:26.920* :  One of the most globally recognized Bangladesh's Mohammed Yunus says many of his companies have been
*22:26.920- 22:32.960* :  forcibly taken over. Mr Yunus who won a Nobel Prize for lifting millions out of poverty
*22:32.960- 22:38.760* :  through microfinancing says that people had broken into his buildings and locked out his staff.
*22:39.320- 22:43.960* :  This is the latest in a long-running feud between him and the Bangladeshi Prime Minister,
*22:43.960- 22:50.120* :  Shaker Sina. He is our South Asia Regional Editor and Barusan Etharajan. He founded the
*22:50.120- 22:56.680* :  Gremine Bank in Bangladesh and what he did was offering small loans to poor women and
*22:56.680- 23:03.060* :  fishermen and also farmers in different parts of Bangladesh. Now this idea spread into a huge
*23:03.380- 23:09.300* :  movement what you can say. We are talking about nearly 40 million people who are associated with
*23:09.300- 23:15.100* :  this microcredit scheme lifting millions out of poverty and that's why Mr Yunus and the Gremine
*23:15.100- 23:20.020* :  Bank they were given these Nobel Peace Prize. Now there is another side to this. It's
*23:20.620- 23:25.580* :  after his popularity of being a winning Nobel Peace Prize during the what you call military
*23:25.580- 23:32.800* :  backed caretaker administration in 2007 at that time even the military was asking him to be the
*23:32.800- 23:39.200* :  president and he was contemplating starting a political party. But that also led to his fallout
*23:39.200- 23:44.720* :  with one of the most powerful politicians of Bangladesh, Shaker Sina, the leader of the
*23:44.720- 23:50.200* :  governing of Amelieks. Since then there have been a lot of problems from the government also
*23:50.660- 23:55.700* :  various cases have been filed against Mr Yunus. He's not now part of Gremine Bank, he's 83
*23:55.700- 24:00.860* :  years old but now what he says is something really extraordinary that people are forcing their way
*24:00.860- 24:06.220* :  into these companies. There are about eight of the companies in this huge Gremine building which
*24:06.220- 24:11.220* :  is outside Dhaka, been to many many times and now the people are trying to take over that is
*24:11.220- 24:17.680* :  very alarming according to him. And he was just convicted and not sent to jail, I believe,
*24:17.680- 24:23.740* :  is out on bail. So this is the latest and a long line of sort of battle between him and Shaker Sina.
*24:24.400- 24:28.920* :  The beginning of this year a court convicted him for six months and the three of his colleagues
*24:28.920- 24:34.840* :  for violating the country's labour laws but later on he was given bail. So he's out on bail
*24:34.840- 24:41.120* :  appending another appeal at the IACOT. But what it shows is that the problems faced by Mr Yunus,
*24:41.120- 24:47.300* :  what he often says is it is not about me, it is about the institutions because the people of
*24:47.300- 24:52.200* :  Bangladesh they have invested money in these companies and what will happen to them that was
*24:52.200- 24:57.620* :  always his argument. But on the other hand the Bangladeshi prime minister used to describe him as
*24:58.220- 25:03.380* :  blood sucker and the Gremine bank of charging exorbitant interest rates and they're flasing the
*25:03.380- 25:08.680* :  poor people and making money. So this wrong-leaning feud is now moving to the courts and that is why
*25:08.680- 25:14.120* :  many dozens of international leaders have asked the authorities to stop what they call a judicial
*25:14.120- 25:19.960* :  harassment of Mr. Yunus. Umbarsan, Etha Rajan and at Cape Canaveral in Florida.
*25:21.000- 25:30.460* :  3, 2, 1, Ignition and West off. Go SpaceX, go IAM-1 and the Odysseus lunar lander.
*25:33.600- 25:39.440* :  That's the sound of the Falcon 9 rocket, a collaboration between the Elon Musk owned company Space
*25:39.440- 25:45.980* :  X, intuitive machines and NASA. The destination, the moon, but we won't know if the mission has been
*25:45.980- 25:51.380* :  successful for another week or so when it's scheduled to touch down. If it works it will only
*25:51.380- 25:57.020* :  be the sixth successful moon landing in history and the first achieved by a private company.
*25:57.540- 26:02.120* :  It's a scouting mission of thoughts designed to assess the lunar environment ahead of NASA's
*26:02.120- 26:09.000* :  current plan to return a crude mission to the moon in late 2026. Luke Jones spoke to retired
*26:09.000- 26:14.080* :  astronaut Jose Hernandez, he began by sharing his thoughts on the launch itself.
*26:15.160- 26:21.140* :  To me it was a perfect launch and then of course recovery of the first stage and landing they
*26:21.140- 26:25.900* :  nailed it. I think it's going to be a very successful mission especially since you consider
*26:26.340- 26:31.880* :  the United States hasn't sent a lander on the surface of the moon for over 50 years and the first
*26:31.920- 26:36.460* :  one that's going to be a commercial one at that. Well what is the difficult bit or the most
*26:36.460- 26:42.980* :  difficult bits actually launching it as we've just seen or landing the lander on the moon? I mean
*26:42.980- 26:50.640* :  where's the moment of most worry for those running this? Well thanks to SpaceX the the launch is the
*26:50.640- 26:55.220* :  least difficult part because they have been highly successful with their Falcon 9 rocket. I think the
*26:55.220- 27:00.500* :  most difficult part we're going to find is actually sticking the landing on the surface of the moon
*27:00.500- 27:05.720* :  and we won't know for a few days if the mission is going to be successful until we do that.
*27:06.040- 27:10.780* :  This is where other countries have gotten themselves in trouble and we're hoping that this commercial
*27:10.780- 27:16.080* :  company intuitive machines will stick to landing. In the past we've just had national space
*27:16.080- 27:20.760* :  agencies doing this and as I mentioned no private company has achieved a moon landing yet.
*27:21.400- 27:27.460* :  Why are we now in the situation where it has to be a mix? Commercial spaceflight tourism spaceflight
*27:27.460- 27:34.280* :  is probably in the early stages of what the airlines used to have in the early 1900s and I think
*27:34.280- 27:41.860* :  for them to be commercially viable they need to collaborate with NASA because NASA has a need
*27:41.860- 27:49.240* :  and and so there's a way of subsidizing their agenda to make spaceflight more affordable because
*27:49.240- 27:54.580* :  let's face it right now spaceflight for the civilian it's a millionaires game and we've got to
*27:54.580- 27:59.420* :  bring the price down such that an average person can seriously consider having this experience of
*27:59.420- 28:07.060* :  corn space. Retired astronaut Jose Hernandez speaking to Luke Jones. If you're a Russian tourist you're
*28:07.060- 28:12.340* :  very welcome in North Korea that was the message from North Koreans tourism sector when they
*28:12.340- 28:17.440* :  welcomed a group of nearly a hundred Russian visitors last week they're the first foreign group to
*28:17.440- 28:24.100* :  visit since the COVID-19 pandemic. Their arrival comes as Moscow and Pyongyang try to bolster ties
*28:24.100- 28:30.040* :  between the two countries but what did the visitors get up to in this tightly controlled country?
*28:30.700- 28:36.680* :  Victoria Urkundas spoke to fear daughter Titsky from the Institute of Korean Studies in Seoul
*28:36.680- 28:44.480* :  in South Korea. They are going to the place near the Sea of Japan to Masikuransky Resort which
*28:44.480- 28:49.860* :  is essentially the Pat Project of North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-in. So who else is then
*28:49.860- 28:55.200* :  being invited? It can't just be Russian tourists. Well from what I heard as of now it's just
*28:55.200- 29:00.540* :  Russians but of course like when it comes to tourism in North Korea they mean targeted
*29:00.540- 29:05.700* :  all the Chinese people. We're hearing those reports saying that the the first
*29:05.700- 29:09.700* :  tourist from Russia who when they are found it's mashing they must have enjoyed themselves
*29:09.700- 29:16.540* :  on the ski slopes but we also know that North Korea is a very secretive country. How much is
*29:16.540- 29:21.700* :  it possible to know about their hospitality? Well I've read some reports about it in Russian
*29:21.700- 29:28.180* :  media so some people who band very very quite beplexed about the bands that exist there because
*29:28.180- 29:34.100* :  like you can only go to any place outside you hotel with a guide and when you're starting
*29:34.100- 29:40.960* :  asking like sensitive questions people usually avoid talking to you. Any opportunity to talk to
*29:40.960- 29:47.440* :  locals would be extremely limited. I myself I went to North Korea twice it has always been like that.
*29:47.740- 29:52.440* :  Is it that people are being stopped from speaking to outsiders or is it that you just hold not to
*29:52.440- 29:57.620* :  engage at all with the locals by this guide? You don't have time. The thing is like everything
*29:57.660- 30:03.140* :  is prescribed here spans exactly the same number of minutes. We pre-approved number of minutes
*30:03.140- 30:09.000* :  in every place, every museum. So you just don't have time to talk to them and of course people are
*30:09.000- 30:14.380* :  a bit afraid to talk to a foreigner. Back to these luxury resorts and the holidays is this
*30:14.380- 30:20.480* :  a way to try and revive the economy bringing some viable source of foreign currency to the country?
*30:20.980- 30:25.000* :  I wouldn't say it's about the economy. Tourism has never been like the major source of income
*30:25.000- 30:31.800* :  and so I think it's political gesture because that result is a bad project of Kim junein. Kim junein
*30:31.800- 30:37.420* :  you probably know started in Switzerland so he wanted to create a bit of a Swiss result in
*30:37.420- 30:44.320* :  home in North Korea so he paid loads of attention to that project but I would visually know one
*30:44.720- 30:50.800* :  has visited it and of course the coronavirus sort of like scrambled his plans and my guess would be
*30:50.800- 30:55.740* :  that something like the Russian Embassy in North Korea came out deep. We knew that Kim junein
*30:55.740- 30:59.580* :  would be pleased and pleasing these supreme leaders were most important thing then it comes to
*30:59.580- 31:06.860* :  dealing with North Korea. Fyodor Tertitsky now to the remarkable pregnancy of a stingray which has
*31:06.860- 31:14.360* :  delighted but puzzled scientists in the US. Why? Well it appears no male ray was involved the first
*31:14.360- 31:20.400* :  known case of such a pregnancy among the species. Chantal Hartle has more on this curious tail.
*31:21.840- 31:28.500* :  Alright there's your girl. Charlotte is swimming nicely around. You can really see her swelling.
*31:28.500- 31:34.380* :  The rust-colored stingray named Charlotte and the size of a dinner plate spends her days gliding
*31:34.380- 31:40.260* :  around a shopfront aquarium in North Carolina. She hasn't been with a male of her species in at
*31:40.260- 31:47.060* :  least eight years so it came as a big surprise for staff there when an ultrasound confirmed she
*31:47.060- 31:53.140* :  was pregnant. An initial and very unlikely theory was that Charlotte could have made it with one
*31:53.140- 31:58.960* :  of five small sharks she shares a tank with but now scientists believe the pregnancy is down to a
*31:58.960- 32:06.100* :  rare type of asexual reproduction known as pathogenesis. I'll let aquarium director Brenda
*32:06.100- 32:14.740* :  Rayma explain. What happens is the female will develop the eggs and then the eggs develop embryos
*32:15.020- 32:20.740* :  while they are still within the mother's belly for lack of a better term for you inside there and
*32:20.740- 32:27.260* :  then they'll grow in the eggs and once they get so big they will literally hatch out of the eggs
*32:28.020- 32:33.260* :  while they are still inside of the mother. This type of reproduction has been documented in
*32:33.260- 32:39.740* :  several species such as crocodiles, sharks and even stick insects. As for why it happens well
*32:39.780- 32:46.040* :  that's still a mystery. Cady Lions is a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.
*32:46.780- 32:51.720* :  We don't seem to see this in mammals and I think that brings up some cool evolutionary
*32:51.720- 32:57.020* :  questions that it's really cool that this has been documented for the first time in this species
*32:57.020- 33:01.540* :  which is near and dear to my heart so I'm really happy that the round the little lowly round
*33:01.560- 33:07.020* :  stingray is getting the the respected deserves. Charlotte is due to give birth to as many as four
*33:07.020- 33:12.940* :  pups in the next two weeks. The aquarium plans to install live cameras so people can see the young
*33:12.940- 33:16.480* :  fish swimming around their tank. Chantal Hartle
