*01:06.580- 01:13.260* :  3 million. That's the number of people who died and there isn't a museum, a memorial or even a
*01:13.260- 01:21.080* :  plaque. How can the memory of 3 million people just disappear? Search for the documentary wherever you

*01:53.260- 02:00.480* :  World Service. I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Thursday the 29th of February,
*02:00.480- 02:05.580* :  these are our main stories. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate,
*02:05.580- 02:11.360* :  has announced he'll step down from the role this year. Washington has said it firmly supports
*02:12.900- 02:18.260* :  territorial integrity after officials in the breakaway region of Transnistria called on Moscow
*02:18.260- 02:25.920* :  for protection. Parliament in Ghana has overwhelmingly approved new legislation making it illegal to
*02:25.920- 02:31.800* :  identify as gay or transgender. Also in this podcast
*02:39.320- 02:44.440* :  one academics unusual way of making his research easier to understand.
*02:49.840- 02:54.740* :  The US Senate's longest serving Republican leader Mitch McConnell has announced he's stepping
*02:54.740- 03:00.460* :  down from his leadership position in November when the US presidential election will be held.
*03:00.460- 03:05.920* :  The 82-year-old has suffered health scares and has fallen out with Donald Trump in recent years
*03:05.920- 03:11.560* :  over his election falsehoods. He announced his decision in an emotional speech in the chamber.
*03:33.640- 03:38.680* :  Our Washington Correspondent Gary O'Donnell told us more about Mitch McConnell and his importance
*03:38.680- 03:46.220* :  to US politics. He's been around for a very long time. He first entered the Senate in 1985 in
*03:46.220- 03:52.040* :  the middle of the Reagan era. He's been there during that time and George Bush senior and
*03:52.040- 03:58.600* :  GW Bush and through the Clinton era and the Obama era and the Trump era in fact. So he's been
*03:58.600- 04:02.400* :  there a very long time. He's the longest serving leader in the Senate and he's really had a
*04:02.840- 04:08.480* :  reputation for being a pretty master tactician on the conservative side. He's kept together
*04:09.100- 04:14.800* :  a party that at times has been pretty fractious but in many ways the party that he joined,
*04:14.800- 04:21.340* :  the party that he felt most at home in is no longer the party of that kind of form or the brand
*04:21.340- 04:27.500* :  of republicanism because Donald Trump has moved it so far to the right that he's really a sort of
*04:27.500- 04:32.580* :  bit of a fish out of water. So do we know why he's decided to go now? No I mean he didn't give
*04:32.580- 04:37.920* :  any explicit reasons. I mean he is 82. He has also had a number of health problems in the last
*04:37.920- 04:44.120* :  couple of years that have drawn a lot of focus and he's also as I was mentioning there you know kind
*04:44.120- 04:49.660* :  of out of step with the party as it is now and he's sort of wrestling with whether or not to
*04:50.080- 04:55.060* :  to endorse Donald Trump in the upcoming election. He hasn't decided one way or another on that
*04:55.500- 05:00.780* :  yet and I think he's you know he's struggling to get some of his priorities done so you know he's
*05:00.780- 05:05.860* :  just broke at a Ukraine package getting a number of his colleagues to vote for that in the Senate but
*05:05.860- 05:11.180* :  the House of House Republicans simply won't pass it and that's because the leadership in the House
*05:11.180- 05:17.140* :  and the atmosphere among House Republicans is very very much different to the party he knows. So
*05:17.420- 05:22.200* :  he's struggling to to keep things together in that sense and he's obviously decided that this
*05:22.200- 05:26.140* :  is the moment to step down although he's going to continue as a senator for at least another
*05:26.140- 05:30.840* :  couple of years. And briefly do you think that pressure on him to back Donald Trump might be a
*05:30.840- 05:35.620* :  factor in his deciding to step down? I mean do you think there's also a hint there perhaps to
*05:35.660- 05:41.040* :  older leaders that perhaps they should take a leaf out of his book? Well that's been the big debate
*05:41.040- 05:47.280* :  here in America you know the country is run by men in their late 70s and 80s white men in their
*05:47.280- 05:53.160* :  late 70s and 80s and he's the first one to bow out if you like the others it's shown no sign of
*05:53.160- 05:58.640* :  that Joe Biden Donald Trump both going full steam ahead for for November but I think there is
*05:58.640- 06:02.380* :  pressure on him to endorse Donald Trump. It's a personal decision for him because of course
*06:02.660- 06:07.720* :  Donald Trump went after his wife who was a cabinet secretary Elaine Chaos and pretty racist
*06:07.720- 06:13.460* :  comments about her. So he's not only grappling with what's best for the party and to get Republicans
*06:13.460- 06:17.720* :  elected and get control of the Senate back in November because they're not in control at the
*06:17.720- 06:22.420* :  moment but also these sort of personal factors and the fact that he blames Donald Trump for what
*06:22.420- 06:28.940* :  happened on January the 6th. Gary O'Donohue in Washington the U.S. has said it firmly supports
*06:28.940- 06:35.060* :  Moldova's territorial integrity after separatists in the breakaway region of Transnistria
*06:35.500- 06:40.700* :  called on Russia for protection. The narrow strip of land along Moldova's border with Ukraine
*06:40.700- 06:46.160* :  has been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since a breakup of the Soviet Union but legally
*06:46.160- 06:52.300* :  remains part of Moldova and is not internationally recognized. The U.S. State Department spokesman
*06:52.300- 06:58.280* :  Matthew Miller said that Washington was monitoring situation in Transnistria. Given Russia's
*06:58.340- 07:03.280* :  increasingly aggressive and destabilizing role in Europe we are watching Russia's actions in
*07:03.280- 07:08.340* :  Transnistria and a broader situation there very closely. The United States firmly supports
*07:08.340- 07:12.440* :  Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.
*07:13.100- 07:18.040* :  Transnistria's appeal for Moscow to protect it from the pro-Western government of Moldova
*07:18.040- 07:25.300* :  sounds very similar to calls made in regions of eastern Ukraine now occupied by Russian forces.
*07:25.960- 07:30.720* :  The Russia editor of BBC Monitoring Vitaly Shevchenko assesses what it means.
*07:31.840- 07:40.980* :  The thing to remember about Transnistria is that Russia has a large military base there which allows it
*07:40.980- 07:48.600* :  to exercise a significant amount of control over what's happening in Transnistria and over what
*07:48.600- 07:57.080* :  such meetings say or do. In fact it's doubtful that Transnistria would exist as a breakaway
*07:57.080- 08:03.860* :  entity from Moldova if this Russian base was not there and secondly importantly we need to
*08:03.860- 08:12.020* :  remember that Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine started after Russia backed and Russia
*08:12.780- 08:18.740* :  installed figures in eastern Ukraine had asked Russia for assistance. Now it doesn't necessarily
*08:19.260- 08:27.900* :  mean that Russia is preparing to invade Moldova or launch an attack on Ukraine from Transnistria.
*08:28.260- 08:35.640* :  It could just be a way of putting pressure on Ukraine on Moldova on the West and also in the past
*08:35.640- 08:41.360* :  Transnistria held a referendum whose results were questioned by members of the national community
*08:41.360- 08:47.700* :  and that referendum supposedly showed that members of the public there they want to join Russia
*08:48.220- 08:53.460* :  and also in the past Russia backed legislators in Transnistria they also appeal to Russia to
*08:53.460- 09:00.440* :  pass legislation to accept Transnistria into Russia so this is a development that needs to be
*09:00.440- 09:07.040* :  watched closely. Vitaly Shevchenko. Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky has called on leaders from
*09:07.040- 09:13.280* :  11th-South Eastern European nations to help his country produce ammunition. Addressing a summit
*09:13.420- 09:19.480* :  in Albania, Mr. Zelensky said supply problems were affecting Ukraine's ability to fight Russia.
*09:19.960- 09:20.960* :  Guadalani reports.
*09:22.040- 09:27.460* :  Vladimir Zelensky told the Western Balkans leaders that ammunition supplies were a major issue for Ukraine.
*09:27.460- 09:32.060* :  His proposed solution was what he called a joint forum for the defense industry
*09:32.060- 09:38.660* :  between Ukraine and the Balkans. All of us I think we have to prepare for what just to be strong,
*09:39.740- 09:46.540* :  to prepare for war or peace it's not about it, to prepare for Putin's next steps.
*09:47.380- 09:53.320* :  If not all of us want to push him back it means that we have to prepare.
*09:54.080- 09:57.520* :  Most of the countries in the region have been steadfast in their support for Ukraine
*09:57.520- 10:02.540* :  with the notable exception of Serbia but the summit's host Albania's Prime Minister Edirama
*10:02.540- 10:06.960* :  said the gathering proved that countries in the Balkans were united in standing
*10:06.960- 10:12.380* :  resolutely with Ukraine against a very real threat to Europe's security and to global order.
*10:13.120- 10:19.020* :  Guadalani. Here in the UK a Bulgarian painter and decorator has appeared in court accused
*10:19.020- 10:24.540* :  of being part of a Russian spying. Tihomir Ivan Chev is alleged to have carried out
*10:24.540- 10:29.440* :  surveillance. He joins five other Bulgarian nationals who are set to go and trial this year
*10:29.440- 10:34.760* :  after being charged with the same offense. Daniel Dismoon was at the court in central London.
*10:35.720- 10:41.720* :  The 38-year-old man is alleged to have been part of an organised network of UK-based Bulgarians
*10:41.860- 10:46.100* :  conducting surveillance against people and places targeted by Russia.
*10:46.740- 10:52.140* :  Five other people were charged last year and faced trial in October but Mr. Ivan Chev's alleged
*10:52.140- 10:58.640* :  role emerged as chat group messages were translated by detectives. Mr. Ivan Chev is a painter
*10:58.640- 11:03.840* :  and decorator and was previously in a relationship with a beautician who is one of those who have
*11:03.840- 11:09.420* :  already been charged. The group allegedly run from a guesthouse in Norfolk is set to have
*11:09.420- 11:15.000* :  carried out surveillance to assist Russia in conducting hostile actions including potential
*11:15.000- 11:20.580* :  abductions. Mr. Ivan Chev is alleged to have had a role in surveillance abroad in 2021
*11:20.620- 11:28.060* :  and 2022. He was remanded in custody. Daniel Dismoon, a group of more than 50 broadcast
*11:28.060- 11:33.520* :  journalists has sent an open letter to the embassies of Israel and Egypt calling for free and
*11:33.520- 11:38.900* :  unfettered access to Gaza for foreign media. Ninety-five months into the war in Gaza,
*11:39.520- 11:44.800* :  reporters are still barred from entering apart from rare escorted trips with the Israeli military.
*11:45.480- 11:50.180* :  The letter sent by correspondence and presenters from the UK's main broadcasting outlets
*11:50.700- 11:55.760* :  also appeals for better protection for the Palestinian journalist reporting in the territory,
*11:56.360- 12:00.200* :  90 of whom are believed to have been killed in the Israeli bombardment.
*12:00.780- 12:03.600* :  The signatories to the letter include the BBC's Jeremy Bowen,
*12:03.720- 12:09.020* :  Ola Gehrin and Vogelkeen, CNN's Christian Armanpur and Skye's Alex Crawford.
*12:09.020- 12:14.600* :  She told us more about why they'd done this. The main thinking is that we're all terribly
*12:14.600- 12:20.940* :  frustrated and feel we're not really doing ourselves justice, we're not doing the story justice
*12:21.100- 12:26.640* :  and people aren't hearing particular information because foreign journalists aren't on the ground
*12:26.640- 12:34.200* :  and this is despite multiple attempts to try to get access into Gaza since October 7th.
*12:34.200- 12:39.080* :  From October 7th onwards, there have been groups of people, teams of people, media
*12:39.080- 12:44.720* :  organisations from all over the world trying to get access into Gaza and we haven't been able to
*12:44.720- 12:50.920* :  and that definitely compromises what is probably one of the most important developing events
*12:50.940- 12:57.440* :  certainly in the region for many, many decades, possibly in the world and will have ramifications
*12:57.440- 13:02.940* :  for many years to come. Alex, you've travelled the world with your reporting and you're in Iraq at the
*13:02.940- 13:09.900* :  moment. How unusual is it in your experience and through your career to have been unable to access
*13:09.900- 13:16.780* :  an area, particularly one that is the centre of a major story? I think it's not unusual that
*13:17.100- 13:23.440* :  governments and some regimes will try to keep you out and that presents definitely a challenge
*13:23.440- 13:30.740* :  for journalists to try and report accurately inside but we're in the past and even now we're
*13:30.740- 13:38.060* :  talking about governments or authorities or regimes that do not describe them as themselves
*13:38.060- 13:45.580* :  as democracies which Israel does describe itself as. Israel is proud of posting that it is a liberal
*13:45.580- 13:52.660* :  democracy with an open media and yet it is deliberately blocking journalists from all over the
*13:52.660- 13:57.860* :  world from getting into Gaza. That is the key difference. I mean in the past journalists like
*13:57.860- 14:05.120* :  myself have had to use boats to get into Myanmar, have had to use all sorts of tactics to try to get
*14:05.120- 14:13.960* :  inside closed off areas and we've managed it. This one is monumentally difficult because it is
*14:13.960- 14:19.040* :  an extremely small area that we're talking about. There are only two border points and it is
*14:19.040- 14:27.620* :  really, really very massively locked down by Israel and also by Egypt and seriously most governments
*14:27.620- 14:32.900* :  around the world should be worried about that. Alex Crawford from Sky News speaking to Rajini
*14:32.900- 14:38.180* :  by Janathan. Israel's Supreme Court rejected the foreign media's request for access to Gaza
*14:38.180- 14:44.180* :  last month on security grounds saying their entry could endanger Israeli forces.
*14:46.360- 14:51.800* :  Still to come Saudi Arabia has made its biggest financial push yet into the world of tennis.
*14:52.380- 14:57.420* :  The Saudi authorities through the public investment fund will be pouring a lot of money into the
*14:57.420- 15:03.400* :  sport. The amount has not been disclosed. They will become the official naming partner of the ATP
*15:03.400- 15:14.660* :  world rankings. The global story helps make sense of the headlines with expert analysis from
*15:14.660- 15:20.700* :  BBC journalists around the world. Social media has essentially siloed a lot of young men and women
*15:20.700- 15:26.620* :  into different algorithmic bubbles. Men and women inhabiting the same environment in the real world
*15:26.620- 15:33.460* :  are very different ones online. One global story at a time in detail every Monday to Friday from
*15:33.460- 15:39.760* :  the BBC World Service. For those Russians who sympathize with Alex Inavani it will cast a very dark
*15:39.760- 15:45.920* :  shadow. This looks like a message. Search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.

*16:30.140- 16:35.980* :  eye witness accounts that tell the story for the first time of the Bengal famine which happened
*16:35.980- 16:40.760* :  in British India in the middle of the Second World War. This series is called Three Million.
*16:40.780- 16:47.000* :  That's the number of people who died and there isn't a museum, a memorial or even a plaque.

*17:02.900- 17:08.240* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. MPs in Ghana have unanimously passed a bill that
*17:08.240- 17:14.080* :  further restricts the rights of gay and transgender people. It includes a three-year jail term
*17:14.080- 17:21.720* :  for people identifying as LGBT. Anyone promoting the activities of sexual minorities faces a five-year
*17:21.720- 17:27.100* :  sentence. This is how some members of the LGBT community in Ghana have reacted.
*17:27.980- 17:33.540* :  I'm so scared, very scared, and I don't know my feet. My life is at stake to be my ending lacra.
*17:33.660- 17:39.520* :  Irrelative towards me, if this being has been passed, any chance you get is going to poison me.
*17:39.740- 17:46.300* :  I feel like relocating from the country itself to any LGBT country which is safe for me to live in.
*17:47.180- 17:52.000* :  The bill still needs to be signed by President Nana Akufo Ado before it comes into effect.
*17:52.640- 17:57.140* :  Those who oppose it say the legislation will infringe on people's rights and freedoms,
*17:57.820- 18:00.340* :  something which is guaranteed in the country's constitution.
*18:00.920- 18:05.340* :  Proponents of the bill argue it will help to preserve Ghanaian family values.
*18:06.280- 18:10.360* :  Our Africa regional editor Will Ross told us more about the proposed legislation.
*18:10.960- 18:15.420* :  Worth mentioning that the current law, so the law that has been there for many decades,
*18:16.140- 18:21.160* :  already states that anyone having gay sex should go to prison for three years.
*18:21.160- 18:25.780* :  So that's to give you some context that there already is that law in place.
*18:25.780- 18:33.200* :  So these are new provisions, including imposing a maximum five-year jail term for anyone forming
*18:33.200- 18:40.440* :  or funding LGBTQ plus groups and there are other provisions up to 10 years for anyone involved
*18:40.440- 18:46.980* :  in LGBTQ plus advocacy campaigns aimed at children and members of the public are encouraged
*18:46.980- 18:53.860* :  to kind of report on others and this has gone on now for three years this bill.
*18:53.860- 18:58.320* :  Interesting that it was proposed by the party that's currently in opposition,
*18:58.460- 19:05.340* :  but unanimously passed in Parliament so both the main parties in agreement on this.
*19:06.040- 19:10.520* :  Worth mentioning also that it's an election year in Ghana and because of
*19:11.480- 19:19.020* :  widespread as we just heard in those voices, there is a feeling amongst many Ghanaians that being gay
*19:19.180- 19:26.380* :  is taboo, people will say they're very religious, they'll say it doesn't match with their religion.
*19:26.380- 19:33.780* :  Now if any member of Parliament were to stand up and say I do not support this bill,
*19:33.820- 19:40.440* :  I think it would be fair to say that that would be a vote losing move by that parliamentarian.
*19:40.460- 19:46.220* :  So perhaps that explains why it was unanimously passed and we now have to see what the President
*19:46.220- 19:51.780* :  Nana Akaforado does because it doesn't become a law unless he signs it into law.
*19:52.340- 19:56.660* :  Will Ross, violence has broken out in Chad today after it was announced that
*19:56.660- 20:01.980* :  presidential election will be held in May and June. Heavy gunfire was heard on Wednesday in
*20:01.980- 20:06.760* :  the capital and demeanor after several people were killed in earlier clashes near Chad's
*20:06.760- 20:12.220* :  internal security agency. The government of the military ruler Idris Debbie who's running as a
*20:12.220- 20:17.560* :  candidate in the election blamed an opposition party, but the opposition said troops had opened
*20:17.980- 20:23.840* :  fire. Our reporter in Abuja, Chris Yorko, has been monitoring the volatile situation in Chad.
*20:24.900- 20:30.480* :  Today what we do know is that there's been tension in in Jamena, the capital of Chad
*20:30.480- 20:38.080* :  and this is as a result of the announcement of a killing of several people after individuals are
*20:38.080- 20:44.940* :  led from the opposition socialist party without borders attacked the national security agency.
*20:44.940- 20:49.840* :  The government said that members of the party attacked the agency and some were killed.
*20:50.180- 20:56.000* :  Some had been arrested but that the government is now searching for more of the members.
*20:56.000- 21:02.200* :  Disastery guard, tension and security agents have been stationed in strategic locations around
*21:02.200- 21:05.920* :  the capital. But the opposition is saying it was soldiers who opened fire.
*21:06.200- 21:12.500* :  Some members of the opposition were arrested, including one of their leaders.
*21:12.500- 21:19.420* :  So there were fears that the top leader of that party, socialist party without borders
*21:19.920- 21:26.400* :  may have been killed. So the members said they went in search of their leader and then they
*21:26.400- 21:33.220* :  alleged that so just opened fire on them. So there had been conflicting accounts of what happened
*21:33.220- 21:39.500* :  because when the government is saying that members of the opposition party attacked the national
*21:39.500- 21:46.500* :  security agency, the opposition party is accusing the government of attacking members of the party.
*21:46.820- 21:51.740* :  And this violence has broken out a day after it was announced that elections would be held in May.
*21:51.740- 21:57.720* :  Currently, Chad has a military ruler, Idris Debbie. He's going to be one of those candidates
*21:57.720- 22:01.240* :  in the presidential election. So it seems like there's a bit of a power struggle going on here.
*22:01.420- 22:06.960* :  Yeah, I think basically what's happening in Chad is more like a power struggle. Idris Debbie,
*22:06.960- 22:13.880* :  the current military ruler took power from after his father was killed. And so he transformed and
*22:13.880- 22:22.320* :  became the president or president of the transition of Chad. Now a party, which is the government party,
*22:22.320- 22:29.340* :  has picked him as its main candidate, even though he has not commented whether he accepts or not.
*22:29.760- 22:34.520* :  But there are other members of the opposition parties that are also just linked for power.
*22:34.880- 22:41.380* :  And with the election now called for May, on May 6, just about two or three months from now,
*22:41.520- 22:48.800* :  it's going to be a very difficult situation if such a crisis that has started if it transforms
*22:48.800- 22:55.200* :  into a bigger conflict, a political conflict. Chris Yochor, the international criminal court has
*22:55.200- 23:01.560* :  awarded more than $52 million in compensation to victims of Ugandan warlord Dominic Ungwen.
*23:01.560- 23:06.380* :  He was a top commander in the Lord's Resistance Army militia and a holligan reports.
*23:07.380- 23:11.820* :  The court identified almost 50,000 victims of Dominic Ungwen's crimes.
*23:11.820- 23:18.780* :  Each person who suffered directly or otherwise will be awarded a symbolic 750 euros or around
*23:18.780- 23:24.820* :  $800. The judge cautioned the victims cannot expect to receive payments immediately.
*23:24.860- 23:31.120* :  The reparations order also noted the physical, moral, material and transgenerational harm
*23:31.480- 23:37.300* :  and awarded collective compensation for community projects to rehabilitate and rebuild broken
*23:37.300- 23:42.660* :  lives. The judge recounted incidents of babies thrown into bushes because they were crying,
*23:42.660- 23:48.700* :  women and girls kept to sexual slaves and people who were kidnapped forced to kill each other.
*23:50.000- 23:55.940* :  Anna Holligan, it was once China's largest property company, but now Country Garden is struggling
*23:55.940- 24:03.600* :  to even stay in business. A liquidation petition has been filed against it for nonpayment of a $205
*24:03.600- 24:09.820* :  million loan. It's part of the story story of China's real estate sector in recent years.
*24:10.320- 24:15.240* :  A sector that makes up around a quarter of the country's GDP but is now mired in debt.
*24:15.960- 24:20.260* :  A liquidation of Country Garden would be a serious blow for the economy of China,
*24:20.620- 24:24.000* :  which has been stuttering in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.
*24:24.880- 24:28.680* :  Roger Hearing asked Thomas Hale, the Shanghai correspondent for the Financial Times,
*24:29.420- 24:35.600* :  will the property firm be wound up? The questions kind of split into two halves here because
*24:36.180- 24:39.800* :  Chinese property developers, although they are listed in Hong Kong and they have their
*24:39.800- 24:43.600* :  holding companies in Hong Kong, the vast, vast majority of their developments and their assets
*24:43.600- 24:47.180* :  are in mainland China. And of course, Hong Kong and mainland China operate according to
*24:47.180- 24:52.440* :  completely different legal regimes, a liquidation order in Hong Kong of the kind that
*24:52.440- 24:57.560* :  creditors are now seeking for Country Garden would not really allow liquidators to seize assets
*24:57.560- 25:04.020* :  in the mainland unless a equivalent mainland court issued a similar order. So the likelihood of
*25:04.300- 25:10.320* :  Country Gardens on Hong entities being liquidated is reasonably high if they don't come up with
*25:10.320- 25:14.760* :  a restructuring plan, but there are very deep question marks over whether a liquidation could actually
*25:14.760- 25:18.500* :  occur on the mainland where most of its developments are. Because we've kind of been here before,
*25:18.500- 25:24.680* :  because Evergrande, which is another similarly in trouble property company, got an order from
*25:24.680- 25:29.660* :  liquidation, Hong Kong, Hong Kong court recently already. It's exactly the same situation.
*25:29.980- 25:34.340* :  Of course, the difference between the two is that Evergrande sparked the ongoing Chinese property
*25:34.340- 25:38.920* :  slowed down in 2021 when it defaulted and it was the kind of problem child of the sector. It
*25:38.920- 25:43.520* :  always been too indebted. It was the world's most indebted developer. Country Garden by contrast,
*25:43.520- 25:48.860* :  which defaulted in October, so two years later, I had prior to that been seen as a safe bet.
*25:48.940- 25:54.020* :  People thought that Country Garden was relatively sheltered from the chaos that was going on in
*25:54.020- 25:58.380* :  the property sector and the fact that it wasn't and that it not only defaulted but is now the
*25:58.380- 26:03.180* :  subject of this liquidation order really just shows how big the problem is for Beijing in terms of
*26:03.180- 26:08.000* :  fixing the property slowed down. And I guess even if, as you say, they aren't necessarily going to have
*26:08.000- 26:13.480* :  their goods seized in China itself. Nonetheless, the pressure on shareholders must be extreme,
*26:13.480- 26:17.300* :  the impression and the confidence that these companies kind of rely on has disappeared.
*26:17.680- 26:22.200* :  In fact, this has become pretty much the most important confidence test for overseas investment
*26:22.200- 26:28.300* :  into China. Enormous amounts of money in excess of about $100 billion has flowed from Hong Kong
*26:28.300- 26:34.400* :  into real estate development in China as part of China's vast urbanization process and what we're
*26:34.400- 26:39.760* :  about to get a pretty clear cut view it might take a few years to become exactly apparent.
*26:39.840- 26:45.280* :  What happens when your investments in the mainland go wrong? Are you able to pursue conventional
*26:45.280- 26:50.620* :  legal processes? Or is it a place at an investment market where you have no hope of getting your
*26:50.620- 26:55.020* :  money back at all when things go wrong? Thomas Hale, the FT's Shanghai correspondent.
*26:56.060- 27:00.780* :  Saudi Arabia has made its biggest push into tennis so far. The nation's sovereign
*27:00.780- 27:04.940* :  wealth fund has signed a major deal with the governing body of men's tennis, the ATP.
*27:05.020- 27:10.680* :  The Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has presided over unprecedented spending on sports since
*27:10.680- 27:16.880* :  becoming Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, leading to accusations that he's trying to distract attention
*27:16.880- 27:23.220* :  from human rights abuses by sportswashing. Our tennis correspondent Russell Fuller told us more
*27:23.220- 27:29.640* :  about the Saudi deal. This deal gen out is with the men's ATP tour and it is described as a
*27:29.640- 27:36.460* :  multi-year strategic partnership. The Saudi authorities through the public investment fund will be
*27:36.460- 27:41.380* :  pouring a lot of money into the sport. The amount has not been disclosed. They will become the
*27:41.380- 27:47.780* :  official naming partner of the ATP world rankings and they will have a specific connection to
*27:48.260- 27:52.900* :  tour events in Indian Wales in California. You'll see the branding on the court when that tournament
*27:52.900- 27:59.160* :  is stage next week in Miami and Florida and also the events in Madrid and Beijing and the season
*27:59.160- 28:05.700* :  ending ATP finals for the top eight singles and doubles pairs of the year. One country that did
*28:05.700- 28:10.840* :  not want to be part of this is the United Kingdom. The Lawn Tennis Association will offer the
*28:10.840- 28:17.120* :  chance to have a similar deal to those other tournaments for on-court sponsorship with PIF but the
*28:17.120- 28:22.260* :  LTA turned the opportunity down when they were approached in January. And there will be those who say
*28:22.260- 28:28.460* :  this is yet another example of Saudi Arabia's sportswashing. I had a very interesting and long
*28:28.460- 28:34.020* :  conversation with the president of the Saudi tennis federation Arige Al-Mutabagani at the end
*28:34.020- 28:40.260* :  of last year and I asked her specifically what she made of the term sportswashing and she laughed
*28:40.260- 28:46.400* :  when answering the question but she said it was their way of promoting the country and to her
*28:46.400- 28:51.300* :  to grow the game and to make sure that not just women are playing the game more regularly but also
*28:51.300- 28:57.600* :  younger people in Saudi Arabia get the opportunity. But we are seeing this on an industrial scale out
*28:57.600- 29:03.600* :  where across a number of different sports like football, golf, formula one and boxing and tennis
*29:03.600- 29:11.100* :  is footprint in Saudi Arabia is increasing all the time. The next gen ATP finals for the rising stars
*29:11.100- 29:16.280* :  of the game took place in Jeddah for the first time last November. There's four more years of that
*29:16.280- 29:21.620* :  deal left to run. Exhibitions taking place on a regular basis and there is still the hope in Saudi
*29:21.620- 29:26.880* :  Arabia that the season ending WTA finals on the women's tour will head to Saudi Arabia from the
*29:26.880- 29:31.980* :  end of this year. Russell Fuller. Scientists sometimes struggle to make their findings
*29:32.620- 29:37.160* :  interesting to those of us for whom chemistry and biology lessons are just a hazy memory
*29:37.160- 29:42.660* :  but one Brazilian biologist has come up with a unique way of bringing his research to life.
*29:43.260- 29:49.920* :  Dr. Walicoster created and starred in an award-winning music video to illustrate his PhD
*29:50.620- 29:54.860* :  on the behaviour of kangaroos and a Murphy reports.
*29:58.220- 30:02.820* :  Are you doing the east today or the north? The video begins with Dr. Walicoster
*30:02.820- 30:09.260* :  driving through an Australian plane observing a group of kangaroos. At first it looks like a usual
*30:09.260- 30:23.820* :  documentary about his research until the serene scene of grazing kangaroos is joined by
*30:23.820- 30:29.040* :  drag queens, ballerinas, classical Indian dancers, street dancers, you name it really.
*30:29.760- 30:34.820* :  And Dr. Walicoster uses this vast array of performers to illustrate what he learned about the
*30:34.820- 30:39.280* :  behaviour types of kangaroos, focusing on the way they act when they work together.
*30:47.000- 30:51.780* :  So what did he learn? So they still have their personality but when they are in groups and they
*30:51.780- 30:57.720* :  are responding as a group, they change their behaviour a lot and they adjust to each other
*30:58.080- 31:02.620* :  and the way they do is actually democratic, meaning it doesn't matter if there are more
*31:02.620- 31:08.000* :  mayors or females in the group whether they are older or younger or even if they're
*31:08.000- 31:12.620* :  individuals with extreme personality in the group, they all adjust to each other so there's no
*31:13.200- 31:18.180* :  evidence for leadership or to one individual driving the response in the group is the perfect
*31:18.180- 31:24.080* :  average of everybody's personality. The link between these findings and dancing drag queens and
*31:24.080- 31:30.040* :  ballerinas may not be immediately obvious but it becomes clear as the dancers begin to interact
*31:30.040- 31:35.960* :  and to adopt each other's movements. The viewer for the video has that clear idea that those
*31:35.960- 31:41.040* :  dancers are different in behaviour so they illustrate the difference in kangaroo personality
*31:41.040- 31:47.160* :  and as those individuals travel between groups of dancers from different styles, they also change
*31:47.160- 31:53.220* :  the way they move. If it's a ballad dancer, they start when they are by themselves showcasing
*31:53.220- 31:59.640* :  pure ballad movements and as they travel to Samba group for example, they start changing that
*31:59.640- 32:05.400* :  behaviour. The clip has won the top prize awarded annually by the American Association for the
*32:05.400- 32:10.580* :  Advancement of Science and as the video comes to a close, the overarching message appears on
*32:10.580- 32:17.240* :  the screen. Differences lead to diversity, it exists within any given species, it's just natural.
*32:17.740- 32:25.140* :  That report by Anna Murphy.
