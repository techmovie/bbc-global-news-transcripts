*01:13.300- 01:16.360* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 21st of February,
*01:16.360- 01:17.580* :  these are our main stories.
*01:17.960- 01:21.620* :  After last week's Israeli siege at assault on a hospital in southern Gaza,
*01:22.100- 01:25.020* :  UN teams have been evacuating some of the patients still there.
*01:25.680- 01:28.180* :  This is the former emergency department of national medical complex.
*01:29.200- 01:30.300* :  And it's a dead zone.
*01:30.600- 01:31.820* :  My words are nodding on.
*01:32.380- 01:35.040* :  I express, I'm going to say what I'm feeling not only for you,
*01:35.040- 01:36.580* :  but for these people that have worked here.
*01:37.120- 01:40.760* :  Following days of negotiations, two major political parties in Pakistan
*01:40.760- 01:42.980* :  say they've agreed to form a coalition government,
*01:42.980- 01:45.720* :  keeping the party of Imran Khan out of power.
*01:46.300- 01:51.880* :  The WHO says it's extremely concerned about the huge rise and measles infections around the world.
*01:52.140- 01:58.240* :  Also in this podcast, we'll hear from this BBC reporter in his running shoes.
*02:00.820- 02:05.220* :  I'm already exhausted and there's a man I'm only getting half the benefit.
*02:06.120- 02:08.300* :  We find out why he's having to go the extra mile.
*02:12.080- 02:14.340* :  Hospitals are normally places of safety,
*02:14.340- 02:19.180* :  but the World Health Organization rescue mission into NASA hospital in southern Gaza
*02:19.700- 02:21.860* :  was to remove patients from danger.
*02:22.380- 02:23.780* :  It's almost certainly saved lives.
*02:23.780- 02:28.820* :  The hospital in Khan Unis was besieged and raided by the Israeli Army last week.
*02:28.820- 02:32.440* :  It's seen as a Hamas outpost by the government in Jerusalem.
*02:33.080- 02:36.800* :  There's no electricity, so no working ventilators for patients there.
*02:36.960- 02:43.540* :  And WHO medics had to use flashlights to lead more than 30 severely ill patients out of the hospital.
*02:44.100- 02:45.280* :  Paul Adams sent this report.
*02:49.880- 02:52.420* :  Spacing near the city so they can see us all.
*02:53.340- 02:57.960* :  After two days of waiting, a UN convoy finally makes it to NASA hospital.
*02:59.580- 03:00.960* :  The sounds of war nearby.
*03:00.960- 03:03.140* :  This is not a simple operation.
*03:03.140- 03:05.720* :  It needs coordination with the Israeli military,
*03:06.340- 03:09.040* :  but there are patients inside who badly need help.
*03:13.240- 03:15.520* :  And we get a head down for how many more spaces we have.
*03:16.320- 03:22.640* :  It still has one patient in a wheelchair, one patient in a wheelchair,
*03:22.640- 03:24.580* :  but when a situation can be certain, the ambulance.
*03:26.020- 03:28.600* :  Inside, the hospital is dark and eerie.
*03:29.060- 03:32.860* :  With head torches, the team moves along filthy, deserted corridors.
*03:33.560- 03:38.480* :  A handful of local staff remains looking after around 150 patients.
*03:39.240- 03:42.900* :  Anxious to get those in need of treatment out of this dismal place.
*03:43.500- 03:47.120* :  Dr. Athanasios Gargavanis is part of the WHO team.
*03:47.440- 03:50.020* :  This is the former emergency department of NASA Medical Complex.
*03:51.900- 03:53.000* :  And it's a dead zone.
*03:53.100- 03:55.440* :  I will prepare the visual to wait it.
*03:55.680- 03:55.960* :  Exactly.
*03:55.960- 03:56.660* :  Wait a minute.
*03:56.780- 03:57.140* :  Wait a minute.
*03:57.220- 04:00.180* :  I want the portable cylinder, that's the cylinder, that's more.
*04:03.580- 04:04.540* :  I need one arm here.
*04:07.060- 04:11.060* :  NASA's director, Dr. Athafal Hoot, is here, looking shattered.
*04:11.360- 04:14.500* :  He's endured long days of military siege and occupation.
*04:14.500- 04:18.640* :  The presence of Israeli troops inside the complex since last Thursday.
*04:18.640- 04:22.140* :  The arrest of staff members suspected of working for Hamas,
*04:22.580- 04:25.780* :  the herding of patients and staff into confined areas.
*04:26.500- 04:31.120* :  Dr. Gargavanis pauses to recognize what the director and his staff have been through.
*04:31.280- 04:35.660* :  My words are not enough to express what I'm feeling not only for you,
*04:35.660- 04:38.480* :  but for these people that have worked here.
*04:43.420- 04:45.180* :  How many more have you to have here?
*04:46.160- 04:49.840* :  Like a patient on life support, the hospital is barely holding on.
*04:50.060- 04:53.660* :  What little power there is is being used to keep a handful of ventilators running.
*04:54.320- 04:55.940* :  Most departments are now empty.
*04:57.540- 05:05.260* :  This place used to reconstruct limbs of patients that otherwise would be amputated.
*05:06.140- 05:08.020* :  Now this place is no longer operation.
*05:09.820- 05:12.980* :  With the sickest patients now safely aboard a fleet of ambulances
*05:13.460- 05:15.400* :  and with Israeli drones flying overhead,
*05:15.940- 05:18.780* :  the international team leaves NASA hospital behind.
*05:18.780- 05:21.720* :  It's dark now and the road is full of rubble.
*05:24.300- 05:29.100* :  At a field hospital in Raffa, an elderly man is helped from an ambulance.
*05:29.660- 05:32.160* :  He looks blank, hardly aware of his surroundings.
*05:32.860- 05:34.800* :  He's safe now, but for how long?
*05:39.040- 05:40.660* :  Another patient needs dialysis.
*05:41.160- 05:42.580* :  She hasn't been treated for a week.
*05:43.300- 05:48.780* :  Without NASA hospital, health care in the southern Garza strip is deprived of one of its most important facilities.
*05:49.500- 05:54.160* :  Dr. Rick Pippacorn is WHO's representative for Garza and the West Bank.
*05:54.740- 05:58.260* :  We were shocked what we actually saw in an instrument of complex.
*05:59.080- 06:03.120* :  This waste everywhere electricity was not working.
*06:03.580- 06:06.460* :  Parts of the hospital are damaged and some severely damaged.
*06:07.060- 06:10.440* :  We should immediately start rebuilding and making sure that
*06:10.440- 06:13.760* :  not some other complex remains and becomes functional again.
*06:14.980- 06:18.000* :  In the absence of a ceasefire, that's unlikely to happen soon.
*06:18.560- 06:21.840* :  Khan Yunus is still a war zone and Raffa is next.
*06:22.660- 06:24.280* :  Paul Adams reporting from Jerusalem.
*06:25.140- 06:29.460* :  With the situation in Garza deteriorating even further, another draft resolution,
*06:29.460- 06:34.300* :  calling for an immediate ceasefire, was presented to the UN Security Council in New York.
*06:34.380- 06:40.320* :  The text had been drafted by Algeria and 13 of the 15 members of the council voted in favor.
*06:40.960- 06:44.400* :  Algeria's representative Amar Benjema defended the resolution.
*06:45.080- 06:50.180* :  This resolution is a stance for truth and humanity,
*06:51.260- 06:58.180* :  standing against the advocates for murder and hatred to life.
*06:58.860- 07:07.300* :  Voting against it implies an endorsement of the brutal violence and collective punishment
*07:07.980- 07:09.920* :  and flicked it upon them.
*07:10.580- 07:12.860* :  In the voting process, Britain abstained.
*07:12.860- 07:15.280* :  Once again, it was vetoed by the US.
*07:15.820- 07:19.260* :  Washington's ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas Greenfield,
*07:19.680- 07:24.740* :  said the US couldn't support a resolution that would have put sensitive negotiations in jeopardy.
*07:25.160- 07:28.220* :  Speaking after the session to report it, she explained the US position.
*07:28.580- 07:33.920* :  They also call for an immediate ceasefire, which would give Hamas the
*07:34.540- 07:37.580* :  cover of not releasing the hostage.
*07:37.580- 07:43.660* :  Part of the ceasefire that we're working on requires that they do exactly that.
*07:43.660- 07:46.880* :  And this resolution did not make that connection.
*07:47.000- 07:52.220* :  And it was our concern that it would send the wrong message to Hamas.
*07:53.200- 07:54.900* :  I spoke to our correspondent at the UN,
*07:54.900- 07:57.320* :  netted topic more about those American fears.
*07:57.800- 08:04.240* :  It's part of alongside Egypt, Qatar, and Israel to get a temporary six-week pause
*08:04.240- 08:06.760* :  and get a release of all hostages.
*08:06.760- 08:12.220* :  And instead said that what they supported was what President Biden has called for,
*08:12.960- 08:15.100* :  temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable.
*08:15.100- 08:19.080* :  But what we heard from several members was a rejection of that.
*08:19.080- 08:23.200* :  The Arab group of nations said they actually thought a security council would be helpful
*08:23.200- 08:29.080* :  for those negotiations. China, for example, said that the US position was untenable,
*08:29.080- 08:31.040* :  given the situation on the ground.
*08:31.040- 08:35.640* :  And that the continued passive avoidance of an immediate ceasefire
*08:35.640- 08:39.720* :  was giving a green light to the continued slaughter of Palestinian civilians,
*08:39.720- 08:44.880* :  and also creating the destabilization of the entire Middle East.
*08:45.380- 08:50.300* :  So a position there from the United States that wasn't really something
*08:50.300- 08:52.200* :  that the rest of the council members agreed with.
*08:52.740- 08:57.160* :  Another, we've been hearing about a US resolution which may be put forward.
*08:57.160- 08:58.040* :  What would that say?
*08:58.240- 08:59.200* :  That's exactly right.
*08:59.200- 09:03.980* :  The US proposal, which hasn't been formally circulated to other members yet,
*09:03.980- 09:05.220* :  it'll be discussed this week.
*09:05.220- 09:10.020* :  But what it proposes is a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable.
*09:10.340- 09:13.060* :  Again, that is in line with what the US has said publicly,
*09:13.100- 09:15.100* :  but it is the strongest language they've used.
*09:15.100- 09:18.640* :  Yes, especially in a security council proposal like this.
*09:18.640- 09:23.340* :  So Israel, its ally will certainly be taking note of the US's proposal.
*09:23.900- 09:26.140* :  And it also focuses on Ruffa.
*09:26.300- 09:30.660* :  And Ruffa, as we heard there from Paul, it's where everybody is looking to next.
*09:30.660- 09:35.380* :  A lot of members of the security council today warned about the looming catastrophe there.
*09:35.900- 09:39.540* :  And the US proposal makes clear that it is against a military
*09:39.540- 09:43.340* :  incursion into Ruffa, saying that that would harm more civilians,
*09:43.340- 09:47.200* :  potentially displace them into neighboring countries, such as Egypt,
*09:47.200- 09:51.300* :  and that it would impact international peace and security.
*09:51.300- 09:56.820* :  But again, given the divisions on the council that we see, Russia, for example,
*09:56.820- 10:02.040* :  accused the United States of putting that proposal out there just to distract from its veto,
*10:02.040- 10:04.380* :  its third veto so far.
*10:04.540- 10:07.180* :  And others said they just hadn't had a chance to look at it yet
*10:07.180- 10:10.060* :  to give their feedback on the US's position.
*10:10.100- 10:13.840* :  Given what you know about the positions of many countries there at the UN,
*10:14.360- 10:15.200* :  would it be likely to pass?
*10:15.460- 10:20.560* :  Well, look, I think whether it gets kind of the necessary votes to pass from other members,
*10:20.560- 10:24.420* :  it's unclear at the moment again because they haven't started negotiations.
*10:24.640- 10:28.660* :  But I think we could certainly see it being vetoed,
*10:28.800- 10:32.480* :  even if it does get enough support from other members by the likes of China and Russia.
*10:33.000- 10:37.280* :  They have vetoed past US resolutions because it didn't call for an immediate
*10:37.280- 10:39.980* :  ceasefire, and they believe at this point, you know,
*10:39.980- 10:43.840* :  just given the large scale of death of Palestinians,
*10:43.840- 10:48.620* :  where nearly 30,000 Palestinians who have been killed by Israel's military operation,
*10:48.660- 10:52.580* :  they feel a ceasefire is necessary for that to get the hostages released.
*10:52.580- 10:56.080* :  So I think we could very much see them veto a call like this from the US.
*10:56.740- 10:58.760* :  Netotovic are the UN in New York.
*11:00.100- 11:06.060* :  Israel is to cap the number of Muslim citizens who can attend prayers at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque
*11:06.160- 11:07.760* :  during the Ramadan Holy Month.
*11:08.220- 11:10.880* :  Despite fears, this could inflame religious tensions.
*11:10.880- 11:12.040* :  Here's Mike Thompson.
*11:12.540- 11:17.100* :  It's thought the move designed to prevent flare-ups at this extremely tense time
*11:17.100- 11:19.340* :  could land up doing the very opposite.
*11:19.340- 11:25.900* :  More than 100,000 Muslims would normally pack into the Al-Aqsa Mosque at peak times during Ramadan,
*11:26.420- 11:29.360* :  but the new cap will at least half those allowed in.
*11:29.360- 11:32.080* :  The mosque, known as the Temple Mount to Jews,
*11:32.080- 11:35.160* :  is deeply holy to both Muslims and Jews.
*11:35.720- 11:39.340* :  The head of Israel's Sinbet Security Service has opposed the measure.
*11:39.800- 11:42.500* :  Ronan Barr said it could greatly inflame tensions
*11:42.500- 11:48.000* :  by making Israel's war against Hamas appear to be one against Muslims in general.
*11:48.480- 11:48.960* :  Mike Thompson.
*11:49.740- 11:54.860* :  It has been 11 days since controversial national elections in Pakistan produced no clear winner.
*11:55.380- 12:00.020* :  Now two major political parties say they've reached an agreement to form a coalition government.
*12:00.420- 12:02.480* :  Our South Asia editor, Ambra Saneta Rajan,
*12:02.740- 12:04.760* :  tell me about the two parties that are coming together.
*12:05.380- 12:09.220* :  One is Pakistan Muslim League of former Prime Minister Nawar Sharif,
*12:09.340- 12:16.340* :  and then the Pakistan People's Party both say that they are now forming a coalition government
*12:16.340- 12:18.920* :  with the help of four other regional parties.
*12:18.920- 12:20.660* :  Now why this is important?
*12:20.660- 12:25.660* :  The independent candidates backed by the jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan,
*12:25.660- 12:29.560* :  they won the highest number of seats, but not enough for a majority.
*12:30.200- 12:34.040* :  And also he fell out of favor with the country's powerful military,
*12:34.040- 12:39.840* :  that means it's difficult to form a government without the blessings of the military in Pakistan.
*12:40.580- 12:44.180* :  Now the Pakistan Muslim League and the Pakistan People's Party,
*12:44.180- 12:46.760* :  they emerged as number two and number three.
*12:47.100- 12:51.440* :  There have been protracted negotiations over who will be the Prime Minister
*12:51.440- 12:52.780* :  and who will be the President.
*12:53.420- 12:58.080* :  Now it is emerged that Asif Ali Zadari, the father of the PPP Chairman,
*12:58.080- 13:01.860* :  Bilal Bhutto Zadari, will be the Presidential candidate,
*13:01.860- 13:06.060* :  and then the Prime Minister will be the brother of Nawar Sharif,
*13:06.280- 13:08.660* :  the former Prime Minister Shabar Sharif.
*13:08.680- 13:10.620* :  These two parties have now come together.
*13:11.220- 13:16.500* :  This brings an end to the political uncertainty that was looming over Pakistan.
*13:17.060- 13:19.960* :  Ambrassan, how stable do you think this coalition will be?
*13:20.280- 13:24.140* :  Given the numbers, it looks like the coalition government could be stable,
*13:24.140- 13:31.100* :  and also the Pakistani media clearly states that this particular coalition has the blessings of the military.
*13:31.480- 13:36.960* :  On the other side, the supporters of Imran Khan will say that this government lacks legitimacy
*13:36.960- 13:39.560* :  because they did not win the election.
*13:40.040- 13:40.780* :  We won the election.
*13:40.880- 13:43.920* :  This all comes amid accusations by Mr. Khan's party.
*13:43.920- 13:49.720* :  There was a massive state-orchestrated election fraud to deny them and outright victory,
*13:49.720- 13:53.740* :  though the government has rejected these accusations of vote tampering.
*13:54.240- 13:58.660* :  So there will always be question about how far this government is legitimate,
*13:59.240- 14:04.200* :  but given Pakistan's economic crisis, given the rising cost of living,
*14:04.200- 14:07.780* :  and then increasing militant violence in the northwestern part of the country,
*14:08.360- 14:13.040* :  the media, the civil society, they have been urging the politicians to reach an agreement
*14:13.040- 14:14.080* :  to form the government.
*14:14.100- 14:19.700* :  So that makes it imperative on the parties to reach a consensus rather than fighting over
*14:19.700- 14:21.920* :  who will be the Prime Minister and President.
*14:21.920- 14:26.720* :  But whether this government will be able to address these countries' economic issues,
*14:27.340- 14:28.420* :  that remains to be seen.
*15:27.020- 15:33.080* :  Mary Buckingham, keeper of the mailbox and webmaster of the 1847 Oregon Trail
*15:33.080- 15:34.640* :  Sourdough Preservation Society.
*15:35.120- 15:38.600* :  So does this Sourdough starter really go back to 1847?
*15:39.180- 15:42.860* :  Yes. The guy we got from, man called Carl Griffith,
*15:42.860- 15:44.420* :  his great-something grandmother,
*15:45.180- 15:49.960* :  brought her across the Oregon Trail when they migrated to Eastern Oregon in 1847.
*15:49.960- 15:53.700* :  It could well be older than that, but he didn't have any more information than that.
*15:54.220- 15:55.680* :  Wow, so you date it back to that.
*15:56.020- 15:58.660* :  Now just talk us through what's happened, because you were sending out
*15:59.160- 16:02.960* :  small, dried samples of this stuff to, uh, would-be bakers who wanted to, um,
*16:03.160- 16:04.360* :  to, you thought it would be nice to use.
*16:04.580- 16:07.240* :  So we've been doing this since 2000 after Carl died,
*16:07.620- 16:10.700* :  and it was perfectly manageable, two to three hours a weekend,
*16:11.360- 16:14.720* :  and, um, we get, you know, 30 to 60 or so weeks,
*16:15.540- 16:16.780* :  sometimes more, sometimes less.
*16:17.300- 16:18.440* :  And, you know, there's no big deal.
*16:18.580- 16:20.240* :  And then all of a sudden, there was this TikTok,
*16:20.820- 16:24.000* :  and we got imitated with, what, 1800?
*16:24.000- 16:30.000* :  All at once, a week, and it's been going like that ever since.
*16:31.140- 16:33.760* :  Right, what's nice about this, though, is obviously a lot of,
*16:34.260- 16:35.760* :  let's call them the TikTok generation.
*16:35.840- 16:38.520* :  Our suddenly being exposed to sourdough and the,
*16:38.860- 16:43.260* :  the joys of keeping it alive, feeding it like it was a pet rabbit or something,
*16:43.260- 16:45.820* :  and, um, they're, they're getting part of the pleasure of it.
*16:46.000- 16:48.540* :  It is a pet. There is a learning curve using it.
*16:48.700- 16:51.620* :  We have lots of information on our website to help with that.
*16:52.060- 16:54.380* :  And I don't know how many people are going to continue using it,
*16:54.380- 16:56.180* :  because you do have to keep feeding it.
*16:56.300- 16:59.680* :  But as you said at the beginning, getting a sourdough stutter,
*17:00.380- 17:04.560* :  to be strong and stable is not that easy.
*17:04.820- 17:06.440* :  There's all kinds of information that says,
*17:06.440- 17:09.060* :  oh, you can just pull it out of the air, and it'll be fine.
*17:09.540- 17:10.260* :  A lot of them aren't.
*17:10.620- 17:13.980* :  And so one that is, is one that's always been treasured.
*17:14.140- 17:17.420* :  Our use of very strong start that can be raised with a lot of stuff.
*17:18.320- 17:21.960* :  Mary Buckiam from the 1847 Oregon Trail sourdough
*17:21.960- 17:22.940* :  Preservation Society.
*17:25.780- 17:26.300* :  Still to come.
*17:26.680- 17:32.320* :  What we can see is if we've got a 79% increase in cases in 2023,
*17:32.320- 17:36.800* :  we would anticipate an increase in deaths in 2023 as well.
*17:36.800- 17:41.700* :  Or the World Health Organization estimates that about 142 million children
*17:41.700- 17:45.560* :  are at risk from the highly contagious measles viral infection.
*17:53.160- 17:57.380* :  When you see Iran close up, you realize just how complex
*17:57.400- 17:59.660* :  a political landscape it is.
*17:59.900- 18:05.080* :  The global story, smart takes and fresh perspectives on one big new story.
*18:05.080- 18:10.080* :  It seems that Iran's strategy at the moment is to increase the tension in the Middle East.

*18:13.120- 18:16.040* :  When Israel does agree to cease fire in Gaza,
*18:16.040- 18:20.640* :  Iran will then worry about Israel then turning its sights towards Iran again.

*18:38.620- 18:41.080* :  For me, that wasn't an option.
*18:41.480- 18:43.220* :  I'd never really was a salad guy.
*18:43.220- 18:44.420* :  That's just not who I am.

*19:02.260- 19:06.040* :  Because I can't wear the same suit for fine dining and kayaking.
*19:06.040- 19:07.540* :  Total faux pas.
*19:07.800- 19:09.860* :  Then I need something casual for the roller coasters.
*19:10.280- 19:11.460* :  Oh, and the music festival.
*19:11.900- 19:12.940* :  Meeting's water side.

*19:18.480- 19:19.200* :  I'll start packing.

*19:31.820- 19:33.420* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:33.420- 19:36.800* :  The mother of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny,
*19:36.800- 19:39.240* :  has made a direct appeal to President Putin
*19:39.660- 19:41.060* :  to release his body to her.
*19:41.480- 19:45.500* :  Standing outside the Arctic prison, where her son Alexei died suddenly last week.
*19:45.500- 19:48.480* :  A video showed his mother, Lyudmila Navalny,
*19:48.480- 19:52.000* :  saying the authorities were refusing to give her his remains.
*19:58.440- 20:01.380* :  Behind me is the IK-3 Polar Wolf colony,
*20:01.380- 20:05.420* :  where my son Alexei Navalny died on February the 16th.
*20:05.820- 20:08.200* :  For five days, I've not been able to see him.
*20:08.520- 20:10.540* :  His body has not been released to me.
*20:11.060- 20:12.760* :  They don't even tell me where he is.
*20:13.400- 20:15.540* :  I appeal to you Vladimir Putin.
*20:15.540- 20:18.680* :  The resolution of the issue depends solely on you.
*20:19.260- 20:21.080* :  Let me finally see my son.
*20:22.160- 20:24.000* :  Mr. Navalny's widow, Julia,
*20:24.200- 20:27.480* :  alleges that his body is being kept until traces of the poisonous
*20:27.760- 20:29.700* :  nerve-agent Novychok have disappeared.
*20:30.320- 20:32.880* :  The Kremlin has denied involvement in his death.
*20:33.280- 20:36.600* :  Dr. Richard Shepherd is a leading UK forensic pathologist
*20:36.600- 20:39.860* :  who's conducted over 23,000 door topses.
*20:40.200- 20:42.280* :  Julian Marshall asked him for his reaction
*20:42.320- 20:46.380* :  to the timescale on the release of Mr. Navalny's body to his family.
*20:46.780- 20:50.520* :  It does take time to establish these causes of death,
*20:50.880- 20:55.460* :  but they seem to have released what they believe to be the causes of death,
*20:55.460- 20:59.080* :  this sudden death syndrome, very, very quickly indeed.
*20:59.080- 21:04.560* :  And that can only be established once one has done not only the original examination,
*21:04.780- 21:08.360* :  but also several complicated laboratory tests.
*21:08.520- 21:11.920* :  So I'm confused by the conflict between
*21:11.920- 21:14.220* :  it's going to take two weeks to establish it,
*21:14.220- 21:16.520* :  and yet we know what the cause of death is.
*21:16.720- 21:18.360* :  On the face of it medically, scientifically,
*21:18.360- 21:21.780* :  there's no real reason to hang on to the body.
*21:22.060- 21:26.100* :  If they've established the cause of death as sudden death syndrome that they say,
*21:26.100- 21:29.700* :  and such a thing does exist, and that can't be disputed,
*21:30.200- 21:32.780* :  but why do they need to hang on to the body longer?
*21:33.000- 21:34.360* :  If they've established the cause of death,
*21:34.720- 21:36.400* :  the body should be released to the family,
*21:36.400- 21:40.600* :  and then other people can perhaps quite correctly examine the body,
*21:40.600- 21:45.480* :  and look at other features, and see if they can confirm that that diagnosis is true.
*21:45.620- 21:48.860* :  What happens to the body after death,
*21:48.900- 21:51.920* :  and in particular that two-week period?
*21:52.800- 21:55.880* :  It very much depends on how the body is stored.
*21:55.900- 21:57.560* :  You know, careful storage of the body,
*21:57.560- 21:59.920* :  there will be minimal degradation,
*22:00.600- 22:02.700* :  but if it's not stored well,
*22:02.700- 22:05.360* :  then there can be very significant changes
*22:05.360- 22:10.680* :  that will obliterate any or many of the marks that might be present on it.
*22:11.060- 22:16.020* :  On the other hand, if the authorities choose to embalm the body,
*22:16.020- 22:18.940* :  to introduce fluids, introduce chemicals into the body,
*22:19.220- 22:26.800* :  that could completely destroy and prevent any further useful analysis of what has gone on.
*22:26.800- 22:29.260* :  So the two things seem to be conflicting.
*22:29.260- 22:32.640* :  There is this, we need two weeks, but you can't have it,
*22:33.120- 22:34.820* :  but we need to examine the body immediately.
*22:35.260- 22:36.380* :  But it may be imbalm.
*22:36.380- 22:38.440* :  So all of these things are working together,
*22:38.440- 22:40.680* :  basically to obfuscate what's going on.
*22:40.840- 22:42.180* :  This is only speculation,
*22:42.220- 22:48.200* :  but if some toxic substance have been introduced into the body,
*22:48.200- 22:51.620* :  would that dissipate over a period of two weeks?
*22:52.800- 22:55.380* :  It really depends what toxic substance it is.
*22:55.560- 23:00.920* :  Here's a man who is incarcerated in a distant prison environment.
*23:00.920- 23:02.900* :  The authorities can do what they like.
*23:02.900- 23:05.660* :  There are so many possibilities,
*23:06.340- 23:07.780* :  some of which may leave a trace,
*23:08.120- 23:11.440* :  some of which would leave no trace in the body.
*23:11.940- 23:14.620* :  And so there are many things that may or may not
*23:14.620- 23:18.320* :  injuries to the body marks on the body chemicals within the body,
*23:18.620- 23:21.620* :  but the quicker an analysis can be performed,
*23:21.660- 23:23.900* :  the more reliable it's going to be,
*23:23.900- 23:25.480* :  and the longer the delay,
*23:25.960- 23:27.460* :  the more that has happened to the body,
*23:27.460- 23:32.400* :  the harder that is going to be to prove an alternative.
*23:33.220- 23:34.960* :  Not to disprove what he said.
*23:35.600- 23:38.080* :  The forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Sheppard,
*23:38.440- 23:42.060* :  meanwhile, Russian police say they're looking for Alexei Navalny's brother, Oleg,
*23:42.480- 23:44.100* :  who's facing fresh, criminal charges.
*23:44.580- 23:47.900* :  His thought to have traveled to Cyprus in 2001,
*23:48.280- 23:50.660* :  but since then his whereabouts have been unknown.
*23:51.400- 23:54.080* :  Runt somewhere attacks can have a huge impact,
*23:54.080- 23:56.280* :  and cost lives and livelihoods.
*23:56.660- 24:00.340* :  We're talking about computer hackers infiltrating areas like hospital systems,
*24:00.340- 24:03.620* :  leading to lost records and crucial appointments cancelled,
*24:03.980- 24:06.400* :  or hacks on oil pipeline systems in the US,
*24:06.400- 24:07.940* :  causing chaos at the pumps.
*24:08.540- 24:11.400* :  Now though investigators involved in an international operation,
*24:11.480- 24:13.960* :  say they have severely disrupted the activities
*24:14.280- 24:16.380* :  of a Russian-linked cybercrime gang.
*24:16.840- 24:20.400* :  So what exactly was the gang doing and how were they taken down?
*24:20.680- 24:22.780* :  Gordon Carrera is our security correspondent.
*24:23.300- 24:26.360* :  This is one of the most significant ransomware groups,
*24:26.360- 24:27.660* :  known as Lockbit,
*24:28.120- 24:34.120* :  around about a quarter of known ransomware attacks are linked to their tools that they provide,
*24:34.800- 24:37.280* :  so they're particularly significant around the world.
*24:37.640- 24:41.480* :  And ransomware where people lock someone's computer, steal the data,
*24:41.680- 24:44.360* :  won't give it back until a ransom is paid, has been growing.
*24:44.700- 24:50.020* :  And this group has been perhaps the most prominent group linked to a number of high-profile attacks.
*24:50.020- 24:54.940* :  And so the aim of this law enforcement operation was to try and disrupt the group,
*24:55.240- 24:58.440* :  and what appears to have happened is that led by the UK,
*24:58.440- 25:01.460* :  but also with America's FBI, with Europe, and others,
*25:01.980- 25:04.160* :  they infiltrated the systems of the group.
*25:04.180- 25:06.640* :  They got inside, they stole the hackers data.
*25:06.640- 25:10.840* :  We hacked the hackers as the head of Britain's National Crime Agency put it.
*25:11.320- 25:12.920* :  Found out about what they were doing,
*25:13.400- 25:15.380* :  stole the tools that they use,
*25:16.220- 25:19.660* :  and then now at this point have gone public to try and basically,
*25:19.660- 25:24.560* :  as far as they can, stop this group operating at least in the same way as the past.
*25:24.620- 25:30.840* :  Now they have been hacked, but presumably this group can then find ways around that.
*25:31.460- 25:34.320* :  Is there going to be a long-term impact on this particular group and others?
*25:34.560- 25:37.060* :  That is an important question, because in the past,
*25:37.060- 25:40.960* :  we've seen groups get taken down as they put it by the FBI,
*25:41.560- 25:43.380* :  but then quite soon they come back up again.
*25:43.560- 25:45.040* :  They find sometimes new names,
*25:45.040- 25:46.660* :  sometimes new technical infrastructure.
*25:47.340- 25:51.860* :  I think what's interesting about this case is Lockbit is effectively a one-stop shop
*25:51.860- 25:54.920* :  for criminals who want to buy this ransomware.
*25:55.120- 25:58.920* :  So what they do is they provide ransomware as if you're like a service to people
*25:58.920- 26:00.340* :  called affiliates who are customers.
*26:00.720- 26:03.920* :  And what's happened is by going very public,
*26:03.920- 26:09.500* :  law enforcement are also sending messages quite openly to those affiliates saying,
*26:09.500- 26:11.980* :  we know who you are, we know where you are,
*26:12.320- 26:15.200* :  we have your data as well, you're the customers of Lockbit.
*26:15.800- 26:20.460* :  So I think what they're trying to do with that is to disrupt the whole business model
*26:20.680- 26:21.660* :  of this criminal group,
*26:22.040- 26:24.960* :  which relies on people of the criminals trusting them
*26:25.360- 26:28.220* :  and believing that their data is safe, if you like, with the criminals.
*26:28.780- 26:33.100* :  And so I think the hope will be to kind of so distrust within this ecosystem
*26:33.140- 26:36.780* :  of criminal hackers and drive a wedge between them
*26:37.160- 26:39.660* :  and that that may have a longer lasting effect
*26:39.660- 26:41.920* :  than simply a short-term technical disruption,
*26:41.920- 26:43.340* :  whether it works or not we'll have to see.
*26:43.660- 26:44.360* :  Gordon Carrera.
*26:45.180- 26:50.260* :  Measles infections across the globe have risen by nearly 80% since 2022.
*26:50.300- 26:55.760* :  The World Health Organization estimates that about 142 million children
*26:55.760- 26:58.900* :  are at risk from a highly contagious viral infection.
*26:58.980- 27:04.140* :  The WHO says a major reason for the increase in cases is a fall in vaccination rates.
*27:04.560- 27:07.780* :  Natasha Crocroft is a technical advisor for the WHO.
*27:08.400- 27:13.600* :  What we can see is if we've got 79% increase in cases in 2023,
*27:13.600- 27:18.060* :  we would anticipate an increase in deaths in 2023 as well.
*27:18.560- 27:21.480* :  But we can't say it's going to be a 79% increase
*27:21.480- 27:24.120* :  because it depends where the where the cases occur.
*27:24.700- 27:27.260* :  Well, in most cases, Measles manifests itself as a rash,
*27:27.340- 27:28.560* :  which simply goes away.
*27:28.560- 27:30.780* :  But in others, it can be very dangerous indeed.
*27:30.780- 27:34.080* :  Julian Marshall spoke to the BBC's Imogen folks, who's in Geneva.
*27:34.660- 27:36.340* :  There can be very serious consequences.
*27:36.420- 27:39.480* :  And I think one of the problems is as you indicated there
*27:39.480- 27:43.540* :  that in many certainly the wealthy parts of the world
*27:43.540- 27:48.060* :  we've forgotten how serious a disease it can be.
*27:48.180- 27:51.540* :  And that's partly because of the very success of vaccination.
*27:51.700- 27:55.300* :  But yes, it can cause blindness.
*27:55.300- 27:59.380* :  It can cause damage to the heart and lungs.
*27:59.380- 28:04.660* :  And it's particularly risky for children under the age of five.
*28:05.220- 28:08.500* :  And it is also highly, highly contagious.
*28:09.340- 28:12.440* :  So if your levels of vaccination slip,
*28:12.440- 28:14.900* :  which is what the WHO is concerned about,
*28:15.800- 28:21.000* :  you know, you risk quite quickly getting a spike in cases.
*28:21.380- 28:22.820* :  And this is what we are seeing now.
*28:22.820- 28:25.420* :  And why the WHO is sounding the alarm today.
*28:26.040- 28:29.820* :  And how much have those vaccination levels slipped
*28:30.400- 28:31.800* :  in certain parts of the world?
*28:32.060- 28:36.220* :  What the WHO is saying is that to have a really good coverage,
*28:36.220- 28:40.980* :  you need upwards of 95% vaccination levels.
*28:41.020- 28:44.440* :  And it flipped down below 90,
*28:44.440- 28:46.940* :  down to around 86%.
*28:47.180- 28:49.940* :  And there are two reasons for this.
*28:50.300- 28:53.020* :  One is in wealthy countries, particularly in Europe,
*28:53.880- 28:56.440* :  in Switzerland, for example, where I am.
*28:56.860- 28:59.540* :  You often hear, I often hear colleagues of mine saying,
*28:59.540- 29:02.220* :  well, I'm not going to get my kids vaccinated for measles.
*29:02.220- 29:03.380* :  They don't need that stuff.
*29:03.440- 29:04.400* :  It's not a problem.
*29:04.960- 29:07.220* :  Sometimes heated words for me who has to listen
*29:07.220- 29:09.320* :  to the WHO warning about that.
*29:09.800- 29:13.000* :  And the other is in poorer countries,
*29:13.000- 29:16.320* :  because of COVID-19, all of their resources
*29:16.820- 29:20.680* :  went into tackling that and shutting down and so on.
*29:21.040- 29:23.800* :  And the routine immunization slipped back.
*29:24.340- 29:28.120* :  And so we have two-fold reason in both low-income countries
*29:28.120- 29:31.200* :  and high-income countries for this spike in cases.
*29:31.900- 29:35.640* :  Two-level where the WHO is now very concerned
*29:36.580- 29:39.940* :  that we could have a really high incidence rate
*29:39.940- 29:42.620* :  in more than half the countries on the planet this year.
*29:43.020- 29:43.720* :  Imagine folks.
*29:44.620- 29:48.300* :  South Africa will hold a general election on May 29th.
*29:48.420- 29:49.980* :  The announcement came on the same date,
*29:49.980- 29:51.940* :  the latest figures showed unemployment,
*29:52.460- 29:53.640* :  already the highest in the world,
*29:53.640- 29:56.320* :  had risen to over 32%.
*29:56.720- 29:57.760* :  Andrew Ochiang reports.
*29:58.160- 30:01.580* :  Mr. Ramapurza and his ruling African National Congress Party
*30:01.580- 30:04.820* :  are hoping he can win a second term in office when the polls come.
*30:05.040- 30:09.180* :  But analysts say this could be the toughest ever election for the ANC.
*30:09.460- 30:11.560* :  With the opposition, mainly the Democratic Alliance
*30:11.560- 30:14.120* :  and the economic freedom fighters lying in wait.
*30:14.540- 30:18.400* :  The reason the ANC has had to deal with major corruption scandals,
*30:18.400- 30:21.860* :  touching on Mr. Ramapurza and his predecessor Jacob Zuma,
*30:22.120- 30:23.460* :  then there's the economy.
*30:23.740- 30:25.560* :  Hours before the election date was announced,
*30:25.560- 30:27.840* :  figures from the statistics office indicated
*30:27.840- 30:30.760* :  an employment had risen in the last quarter of last year
*30:30.760- 30:32.680* :  to above 32%.
*30:33.060- 30:36.800* :  Meaning nearly 8 million of those eligible voters are jobless.
*30:37.660- 30:38.520* :  Andrew Ochiang.
*30:39.360- 30:42.020* :  Now it's often said that because of discrimination in the workplace,
*30:42.020- 30:46.840* :  women have to work a lot harder to achieve the same level of success as men.
*30:47.440- 30:50.280* :  Or could the opposite be the case when it comes to exercise?
*30:50.280- 30:54.960* :  A new American study has found that men need to spend twice as long exercising
*30:55.080- 30:58.020* :  as women to get the same long-term health benefits,
*30:58.420- 31:01.000* :  including a reduced risk of early death from heart attacks.
*31:01.460- 31:06.500* :  It tracked the health of almost 40,000 adults between 1997 and 2019.
*31:07.160- 31:09.500* :  So what's the reason behind these striking results?
*31:09.500- 31:12.360* :  Our reporter Alfie Habershon has been trying to find out.
*31:21.920- 31:24.720* :  I've just gone for a quick 10 minute run around the office.
*31:25.900- 31:29.400* :  It's good to be outside even if it's a cold day here in London.
*31:30.360- 31:32.700* :  My heart rate is up and I'm breathing deeper,
*31:33.600- 31:37.020* :  but it's frustrating to think a woman could get similar benefits I'm getting
*31:37.480- 31:38.580* :  by running for just five minutes.
*31:39.400- 31:43.580* :  That's according to a new study by the Journal of American College of Cardiology.
*31:44.340- 31:46.880* :  Co-author Martha Galatti told me more.
*31:47.160- 31:52.580* :  Some of the physiologic differences that might be related to why women benefit more
*31:52.580- 31:59.060* :  from less physical activity is, first of all, women have lower lean mass and lower muscle mass.
*31:59.720- 32:03.540* :  And they also have smaller muscle fibers when compared with men.
*32:04.400- 32:10.500* :  Additionally, women tend to have a higher density of blood flow or capillaries which feed the
*32:10.500- 32:13.960* :  muscles. It's even better news for women when it comes to lifting weights.
*32:13.960- 32:19.220* :  The study said they only need to do this once a week to achieve the same benefit I might get
*32:19.220- 32:21.300* :  from visiting the gym three times a week.
*32:21.820- 32:27.200* :  So far, just 6% of sport science research has focused exclusively on women's bodies,
*32:27.860- 32:32.840* :  and former British Rower, Baz Moffat says she hopes the results will motivate women to do more
*32:32.840- 32:38.700* :  exercise where they can. I don't want us to interpret this information as kind of patronising
*32:38.700- 32:43.880* :  women and telling women, oh well, if you can find the time, you don't need to do as much as men.
*32:44.320- 32:47.580* :  I'd like to think that we look at this study and we say, right, women,
*32:48.040- 32:52.400* :  anything is better than nothing and you will be gaining physiologically and you'll be gaining
*32:52.400- 32:56.520* :  more according to this study than the men are. You know, you're getting more bang from your
*32:56.520- 33:00.100* :  buck for every minute of exercise that you're doing. It's worth noting that the results of the
*33:00.100- 33:05.460* :  study were self-reported. This means it's possible that the male participants did less exercise
*33:05.460- 33:11.940* :  in reality than they said they did, something we've all been guilty of. But perhaps either way,
*33:12.240- 33:15.580* :  findings like these will push us all to do a little bit more.
*33:22.740- 33:25.040* :  That report was by Alfie Habershon.
*33:27.620- 33:31.740* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
