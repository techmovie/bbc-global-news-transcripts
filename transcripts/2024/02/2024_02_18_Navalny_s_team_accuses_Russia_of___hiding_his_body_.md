*01:07.740- 01:10.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:13.040- 01:17.880* :  Hello, I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Sunday, the 18th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:18.420- 01:23.140* :  The whereabouts of the body of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny remain unknown.
*01:23.860- 01:26.940* :  The Russian authorities are refusing to release it to his family.
*01:26.940- 01:37.520* :  The US President Joe Biden has blamed congressional inaction for Ukraine's defeat in the front line town of Adivka during a phone call with President Zelensky.
*01:38.060- 01:43.220* :  Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he won't bow to international pressure over Israel's offensive in Gaza.
*01:45.740- 01:50.080* :  Also in this podcast, a long time ago in a flat in West London.
*01:54.220- 01:59.400* :  The discarded Star Wars memorabilia, feeling the force of the auctioneer's gavel.
*02:03.200- 02:07.040* :  Russia has seen its biggest political protests for more than a year.
*02:07.040- 02:13.360* :  Reaction to the death announced on Friday of Vladimir Putin's most formidable opponent, Alexei Navalny.
*02:13.400- 02:19.840* :  An independent monitoring group says around 350 people have now been detained in cities across Russia
*02:20.260- 02:23.840* :  as mourners brought flowers to lay at impromptu memorials.
*02:24.040- 02:28.000* :  And Saturday, some of Mr. Navalny's supporters went out onto the streets of Moscow.
*02:30.660- 02:37.460* :  This is very sad for us all, but Alexei said not to give up and we won't give up and let them think that they have won.
*02:37.980- 02:42.960* :  That's not true. History, truth and goodness are on our side, we will definitely win.
*02:44.420- 02:47.620* :  The main thing is truth, truth to power.
*02:51.820- 02:56.080* :  We only live once, moreover if we don't come out now than when.
*02:56.080- 03:00.500* :  Now we may be detained and then released, but later we may not be released.
*03:00.540- 03:03.980* :  We are not Belarus yet, so we can still go out.
*03:03.980- 03:06.940* :  We can still speak our opinion, at least so.
*03:08.320- 03:13.480* :  And on Saturday, Mr. Navalny's mother and lawyer reached the morgue near the remote Arctic prison
*03:13.480- 03:17.440* :  where he died on Friday, but were told it did not have his body.
*03:17.660- 03:22.280* :  The authorities then said the family wouldn't receive the remains until a post-mortem was complete.
*03:23.120- 03:29.460* :  But Kira Yarmish, a spokesperson for the Navalny family, says his body is purposely being
*03:29.460- 03:33.480* :  withheld by the Russian government. Adding, she had no doubt, he'd been murdered.
*03:33.940- 03:38.160* :  What is happening right now is that they are trying to cover traces.
*03:38.800- 03:45.280* :  This is why they're not giving the body to his family, and this is why they're just hiding him from them.
*03:46.220- 03:49.480* :  I spoke to the BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford,
*03:49.860- 03:53.520* :  and asked her for more on the protests. They may not have been huge,
*03:53.520- 03:56.140* :  but away for those people to mark this moment.
*03:56.600- 04:00.560* :  Although the way that they have marked this moment is also telling in itself.
*04:00.860- 04:06.700* :  Instead of people pouring onto the streets in angry protest and shouting political slogans,
*04:06.700- 04:13.560* :  what they did was they began carrying flowers and other tributes to monuments to political
*04:13.560- 04:19.060* :  repression from Stalin's time around Russia. Those were the sites that were chosen.
*04:19.060- 04:24.940* :  Obviously, huge political symbolism in the decision to use monuments from historic political
*04:24.940- 04:28.940* :  repression to mark the death of Alexei Navalny, who of course was imprisoned,
*04:29.440- 04:31.840* :  because of his politics and has died in that prison.
*04:32.000- 04:36.060* :  So, those protests have been rather more acts of remembrance,
*04:36.060- 04:38.740* :  but in themselves, they are acts of defiance.
*04:38.780- 04:43.200* :  Because, of course, in Russia today, it is extremely difficult to protest,
*04:43.200- 04:48.620* :  and it is extremely easy to be arrested while making any kind of political statement.
*04:48.620- 04:54.100* :  So, we've seen people who've even stood next to those heaps of flowers with signs saying,
*04:54.100- 04:57.360* :  for example, we won't forgive and we won't forget, those kinds of slogans,
*04:57.360- 05:00.360* :  those people then getting dragged away by police through the snow.
*05:00.360- 05:04.960* :  So, some 300 or so people, I think, have been detained so far, and they're probably face fines
*05:04.960- 05:07.340* :  or short periods in police custody.
*05:07.980- 05:12.400* :  Meanwhile, Sarah, a lot of people are deeply suspicious about why the authorities are not releasing
*05:12.400- 05:17.500* :  the body. What do we know about what Russia is saying about an investigation into the death?
*05:17.700- 05:22.700* :  Very little, and obviously, a huge lack of trust from Navalny's family, his lawyer,
*05:22.700- 05:26.960* :  his supporters towards the Russian state, which is absolutely understandable,
*05:26.960- 05:31.300* :  given that this is a man who was poisoned with a nerve agent just three years ago.
*05:31.300- 05:34.120* :  So, they don't trust a single word that comes to the authorities, and at the moment,
*05:34.120- 05:36.440* :  the authorities are actually saying, very little.
*05:36.440- 05:40.100* :  But, what is absolute fact is that they don't yet have a body.
*05:40.100- 05:45.000* :  So, the investigative committee, a powerful body, is saying that the body of Alexei Navalny
*05:45.000- 05:47.920* :  will be released once they've finished their work.
*05:48.180- 05:54.100* :  But the family, so his mother, is basically moving around towns in the Arctic,
*05:54.100- 05:57.740* :  trying to find the body of her son to at least discover where exactly it's located.
*05:58.280- 06:03.240* :  Because, of course, the family and Mr. Navalny's supporters want to know for themselves exactly
*06:03.240- 06:07.820* :  why and how he died, and they won't believe the official investigation or report.
*06:08.080- 06:12.520* :  So, the authorities not saying much about Mr. Navalny's body, not saying much at all,
*06:12.520- 06:17.760* :  despite a deluge of criticism from around the world from Joe Biden downwards.
*06:18.180- 06:19.560* :  No, saying very, very little.
*06:19.760- 06:24.520* :  Vladimir Putin, of course, appeared for a kind of pre-planned event at a factory,
*06:24.520- 06:26.860* :  but he said absolutely nothing at all.
*06:26.860- 06:30.160* :  He very, very, rarely referred to Alexei Navalny when he was alive.
*06:30.160- 06:31.640* :  He never referred to him by name.
*06:31.640- 06:35.140* :  That was deliberate, and I think, you know, we'll wait and see.
*06:35.140- 06:40.280* :  But for now, absolutely no comment from the Kremlin, apart from, to say that the comments from world leaders
*06:40.280- 06:41.460* :  have been unacceptable.
*06:42.180- 06:42.880* :  Sarah Rainsford.
*06:43.520- 06:48.260* :  President Biden has blamed the U.S. Congress for the fall of the Ukrainian town of
*06:48.260- 06:52.700* :  Evdivkir to Russian forces in a telephone call with President Zelensky.
*06:52.700- 06:57.600* :  Mr. Biden said inaction by Washington had left Ukraine's troops without enough ammunition.
*06:58.320- 06:59.780* :  From Washington, we'll burn and report.
*06:59.820- 07:05.520* :  In a phone call with President Zelensky, Joe Biden emphasized the need for the U.S. Congress
*07:05.520- 07:09.620* :  to urgently pass legislation to grant more military aid to Ukraine.
*07:10.460- 07:13.520* :  It was congressional inaction, said the White House statement,
*07:13.520- 07:17.080* :  that led to the Ukrainian armies withdrawal from Evdivkir,
*07:17.460- 07:19.460* :  due to a shortage of supplies and ammunition.
*07:20.280- 07:25.520* :  In recent months, Republican lawmakers have repeatedly failed to approve $60 billion
*07:25.660- 07:28.240* :  of desperately needed funds for Kiev.
*07:28.240- 07:34.000* :  Speaking in Munich, the American Vice President, Kamala Harris, said Washington couldn't play
*07:34.000- 07:37.120* :  political games with the issue of support for Ukraine.
*07:37.120- 07:43.440* :  Politics should play no role in standing for the fact that Vladimir Putin,
*07:43.500- 07:50.080* :  through his leadership of Russia, has shown himself to be fundamentally
*07:51.200- 07:53.400* :  hostile to democratic principles.
*07:54.140- 07:58.100* :  Mr. Zelensky expressed gratitude for Mr. Biden's backing, adding,
*07:58.100- 08:01.500* :  I believe the U.S. Congress will make a wise decision.
*08:02.460- 08:07.640* :  Well, earlier, President Zelensky said that his troops have been heavily outnumbered
*08:07.640- 08:11.900* :  by the Russians at Evdivkir and had withdrawn to save lives.
*08:11.900- 08:16.920* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Kiev, James Wardhouse, about the latest Russian military success.
*08:17.600- 08:22.080* :  Evdivkir poses a lot of difficult questions, mostly for Ukraine,
*08:22.460- 08:25.680* :  in that the fear is that it could be the first of many.
*08:26.460- 08:31.340* :  And I think Evdivkir is symptomatic of this war of attrition that this invasion has now become,
*08:31.520- 08:33.740* :  where you have both sides trying to exhaust each other,
*08:34.160- 08:37.100* :  but crucially, Russia can remain on a war footing.
*08:37.100- 08:40.900* :  So you have President Zelensky, who can say with quite a lot of confidence in Munich,
*08:41.280- 08:42.240* :  to other world leaders.
*08:42.840- 08:48.260* :  This, the wording he used was, this artificial shortfall in weaponry and ammunition,
*08:48.260- 08:50.940* :  is causing Russia to advance in this way.
*08:51.180- 08:55.620* :  What he's implying is that this is a choice, and that only if those supplies are replenished,
*08:55.620- 09:01.260* :  or restored to the levels they once were, can Ukraine take back control of more of its territory?
*09:01.720- 09:06.240* :  What are the next areas that could be vulnerable to Russia's expansion here?
*09:06.560- 09:11.380* :  It's best to imagine this eastern flank of the front line, like a beach, where you have Russia
*09:12.300- 09:15.680* :  making a huge push in the northeast, towards the city of Kupiansk.
*09:16.040- 09:21.020* :  But now they have Evdivkir, they've also been pummeling this small town of Pekrofsk,
*09:21.220- 09:25.140* :  which I was there about six months ago, which is the hub for soldiers,
*09:25.640- 09:28.720* :  the hotel we stayed in that was subsequently destroyed by a missile.
*09:29.160- 09:32.440* :  The only restaurant that we ate there was destroyed by a missile.
*09:32.440- 09:34.840* :  It is firmly in Russia's side.
*09:34.980- 09:38.740* :  So it'll be interesting to see whether the Russians stop there,
*09:38.780- 09:42.200* :  or whether they are indeed able to push further ahead.
*09:42.200- 09:47.100* :  But crucially, what we're not talking about here is the Ukrainian liberation.
*09:47.260- 09:51.480* :  And I think that is now widely accepted, that any hope of Ukraine repelling Russia completely.
*09:52.040- 09:54.020* :  That couldn't be more on the back burner.
*09:54.360- 09:57.560* :  By the admission of its own generals, it's on a defensive footing.
*09:57.560- 10:03.320* :  It is in holding on mode while President Zelensky tries to find some kind of political solution.
*10:03.660- 10:08.040* :  Ukraine says it's outgunned in many areas of the country by Russia.
*10:08.520- 10:13.400* :  To what extent could the $60 billion US dollars that are held up in Washington at the moment
*10:13.940- 10:15.340* :  help redress that imbalance?
*10:15.840- 10:16.780* :  Well, it would significantly.
*10:16.780- 10:21.020* :  I mean, if we look at the last package of that size, I remember it.
*10:21.020- 10:23.560* :  I remember after Ukraine's extraordinary defensive Kiev,
*10:24.280- 10:26.680* :  it was only once a similar package arrived from the US
*10:26.680- 10:28.640* :  that it could start to prepare for more.
*10:28.800- 10:32.340* :  It was in a position to at least attempt a huge counter-offensive in 2023.
*10:32.380- 10:35.780* :  When you're talking about a package worth tens of billions of dollars,
*10:35.780- 10:37.960* :  that means longer-range missiles.
*10:37.960- 10:41.180* :  That means artillery shells to a huge extent.
*10:41.360- 10:44.020* :  And the reason is going to keep coming back to the US.
*10:44.020- 10:47.340* :  It is the US and the US alone, which leads the way on weaponry.
*10:47.720- 10:49.480* :  And as long as this disagreement goes on,
*10:49.680- 10:53.380* :  then the pressure will mount on Kiev to make some kind of territorial concession.
*10:53.760- 10:55.300* :  But what does Kiev say to that every time?
*10:55.300- 11:02.900* :  Vladimir Putin won't stop here, no matter what he signs by way of a cease-fire or longer-term peace agreement?
*11:03.560- 11:04.380* :  James Waterhouse.
*11:05.340- 11:10.360* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to carry on the war against Hamas,
*11:10.760- 11:12.520* :  regardless of international pressure.
*11:13.100- 11:15.500* :  He insisted victory was within sight.
*11:15.680- 11:16.480* :  Here's Mike Thompson.
*11:16.940- 11:19.420* :  In the face of unprecedented international pressure,
*11:19.420- 11:22.020* :  some from Israel's biggest ally, the US,
*11:22.020- 11:27.740* :  Mr Netanyahu said the planned offensive on Gaza's southernmost city rapper would go ahead.
*11:28.280- 11:31.380* :  To stop now, he insisted would hand victory to Hamas.
*11:31.940- 11:34.640* :  One and a half million civilians are sheltering there.
*11:35.160- 11:39.580* :  A Palestinian state, Mr Netanyahu, reiterated, was out of the question
*11:39.980- 11:44.160* :  as were peace talks, given what he called Hamas's delusional demands.
*11:44.380- 11:49.120* :  Some might use the same word to describe the beleaguered Prime Minister's claim
*11:49.480- 11:52.240* :  that Israel is largely getnited behind his policies.
*11:53.120- 11:53.600* :  Mike Thompson.
*11:54.560- 12:00.160* :  Scientists in Italy and the USA have been researching whether playing table tennis may help people
*12:00.160- 12:03.420* :  with neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis.
*12:04.160- 12:08.680* :  The partnership came about because of one Italian doctor who's practising in the US.
*12:08.700- 12:15.320* :  And Tonino Barbera has been telling Rebecca Kesby how he himself was diagnosed with MS
*12:15.800- 12:18.200* :  and discovered that table tennis, sometimes called ping pong,
*12:18.600- 12:19.480* :  relieved his symptoms.
*12:20.480- 12:26.540* :  I started feeling like a boiling oil just sitting on my red hip.
*12:26.820- 12:28.260* :  And I had no idea what to do.
*12:28.260- 12:29.520* :  I started almost crying.
*12:29.520- 12:31.140* :  I mean, this pain was unbearable.
*12:32.180- 12:36.860* :  And Friday, I did an MRI of my brain and it was like a Christmas tree.
*12:37.280- 12:43.480* :  So the MRI of a brain generally looks gray and we have so many light bulbs.
*12:43.500- 12:47.260* :  I mean, those are the plaques of multiple sclerosis.
*12:47.560- 12:52.120* :  I mean, you're a medical doctor, you're an obstetrician and gynecologist,
*12:52.120- 12:54.700* :  very sort of high-flying career.
*12:55.620- 12:57.520* :  You must have been devastated by that.
*12:57.820- 13:02.720* :  Well, I was indeed, because during the first clinical assessment that he made,
*13:03.700- 13:05.820* :  I kept asking, do I ever mess?
*13:06.420- 13:08.920* :  And he was looking at me and he was answering, yes, you do.
*13:09.480- 13:15.220* :  So you did realize that by playing ping pong of all things,
*13:15.220- 13:17.480* :  that seemed to help your symptoms.
*13:17.680- 13:19.720* :  How did you work that out?
*13:20.500- 13:25.680* :  One of my discomfort that became a painful sensation for a while,
*13:26.140- 13:28.040* :  is a sense of constriction on my chest.
*13:28.040- 13:30.520* :  I mean, 24 hours a day, in the world of medicine,
*13:30.520- 13:33.520* :  this thing is referred as the MS hug.
*13:34.360- 13:35.660* :  And people do not know what to do.
*13:36.500- 13:39.660* :  And so I was playing a little bit of ping pong in the garage with my son.
*13:40.220- 13:41.560* :  I felt something strange.
*13:41.820- 13:43.460* :  After a couple of days that we were playing,
*13:44.260- 13:47.000* :  I realized that this sensation was disappearing.
*13:47.000- 13:50.220* :  When I called this, the elephant sitting on my chest.
*13:50.340- 13:53.740* :  This elephant is really leaving my chest and sitting on the corner in the chair.
*13:53.880- 13:55.280* :  Oh my gosh, how can that be possible?
*13:55.740- 13:59.520* :  But what do you think it is about ping pong that has that effect?
*14:00.300- 14:01.380* :  It's a fast game.
*14:01.420- 14:03.620* :  If we challenge our brain,
*14:03.700- 14:07.260* :  there is a specific area in our brain called hippocampus
*14:07.900- 14:09.760* :  that generates new cells.
*14:10.340- 14:12.380* :  This process is called neurogenesis.
*14:13.180- 14:14.640* :  Now, what these cells do eventually,
*14:14.640- 14:16.340* :  they create new connections,
*14:17.220- 14:18.900* :  new nerve pathway.
*14:19.880- 14:20.980* :  Well, think about that.
*14:20.980- 14:25.000* :  I mean, I was lucky enough to recover from my two attacks
*14:25.800- 14:30.140* :  because my body was able eventually to create new miling
*14:30.140- 14:33.980* :  that is this protective layer that goes around the nerves.
*14:34.500- 14:36.320* :  Why other people do not?
*14:36.620- 14:39.480* :  So you think it is because it's such a fast game
*14:39.520- 14:42.020* :  that your brain, your eye, hand, eye coordination
*14:42.020- 14:45.680* :  is having to happen much faster than in other sports?
*14:46.420- 14:49.900* :  Yes, it's the number of things that happen at once
*14:50.380- 14:51.300* :  in a very short time.
*14:51.820- 14:53.820* :  So there is an increase of vascularization
*14:53.820- 14:55.520* :  to specific area of your brain.
*14:55.900- 14:58.680* :  There are different senses that need to be activated
*14:59.140- 15:00.460* :  and they need to work together.
*15:00.980- 15:03.320* :  But on top of that, you need to move as well.
*15:04.060- 15:06.180* :  You need also to relax because
*15:06.840- 15:07.800* :  you don't have time to get stressed
*15:07.940- 15:09.500* :  because the ball is coming back at you.
*15:10.380- 15:11.820* :  So in any physical activity,
*15:11.820- 15:14.640* :  there is always this stressful component of learning
*15:14.640- 15:18.020* :  and being stressed and the hedonistic component as well.
*15:18.440- 15:22.040* :  So increasing the pleasure of this physical activity
*15:22.040- 15:25.580* :  really indeed produce a joyful activity.
*15:26.100- 15:30.200* :  And so you were able to push for this to be looked into
*15:30.460- 15:32.280* :  and get other scientists on board
*15:32.320- 15:34.600* :  to do some real research into this.
*15:34.940- 15:36.020* :  So I trained myself.
*15:36.020- 15:37.540* :  I read as much as I could.
*15:37.540- 15:40.540* :  But I said, well, I want to run myself by expert.
*15:40.820- 15:44.080* :  And I said, okay, let me propose this project to people.
*15:44.640- 15:47.340* :  And we put up together scientific protocols
*15:47.820- 15:51.200* :  to see if indeed our intervention means this
*15:51.940- 15:53.600* :  activity based on table tennis.
*15:53.600- 15:57.980* :  Main did improve the total quality of life of these people.
*15:58.340- 16:00.300* :  At the beginning, I noticed immediately
*16:00.300- 16:03.740* :  that especially people with Parkinson and multiple sclerosis,
*16:04.160- 16:05.660* :  they were improving in front of my face.
*16:05.940- 16:07.540* :  Their balance was improving.
*16:08.000- 16:09.260* :  Their mood was improving.
*16:09.260- 16:10.860* :  Their coordination was improving.
*16:10.860- 16:12.600* :  Their stiffness was improving.
*16:13.040- 16:15.520* :  I mean, they were coming smiling and living smiling.
*16:15.960- 16:18.200* :  And also, we were building this sense of community.
*16:18.520- 16:21.700* :  So I told myself, okay, guys, we need to prove this.
*16:22.780- 16:24.100* :  Antonino Barbera there.
*16:24.320- 16:25.740* :  And the research is being expanded
*16:25.980- 16:27.660* :  and may also include dementia.
*16:30.640- 16:31.240* :  Still to come.
*16:31.780- 16:36.360* :  People, they need something that's for them
*16:37.060- 16:38.600* :  just a concentrate on.
*16:39.500- 16:43.220* :  It doesn't matter what you make, however hideous it is.
*16:44.020- 16:46.240* :  Part of an eight-minute film about the world of knitting
*16:46.240- 16:49.100* :  that's been nominated for best short animation
*16:49.120- 16:52.160* :  today's British Academy Film Awards in London.
*16:56.580- 16:58.140* :  Remarkable personal stories.
*16:58.140- 16:58.760* :  Trail.
*16:58.760- 17:01.560* :  It runs through my life and runs through my story.
*17:01.740- 17:02.900* :  Deep dive documentaries.
*17:02.900- 17:05.520* :  These children are using their own bags,
*17:05.860- 17:06.880* :  not to carry books,
*17:07.140- 17:08.760* :  but they carry the drug markets
*17:08.760- 17:10.840* :  Sweden on their shoulders.
*17:10.840- 17:13.660* :  And sport, but not as you know it.
*17:13.720- 17:15.740* :  There's this massive landslide of myth
*17:16.120- 17:17.880* :  and somewhere in there is the truth.
*17:17.880- 17:20.800* :  The BBC World Service tells the world's stories.
*17:21.260- 17:22.660* :  Search for livesless ordinary,
*17:22.660- 17:25.180* :  the documentary, and amazing sport stories.

*18:07.040- 18:08.560* :  Next to Hungary,
*18:09.120- 18:11.880* :  where the Prime Minister Victor Orburn has promised a package
*18:11.880- 18:13.940* :  of new child protection measures.
*18:14.420- 18:16.600* :  That's after a week of high profile resignations
*18:16.600- 18:20.000* :  and a mass protest over a child's sexual abuse scandal.
*18:20.560- 18:21.960* :  He made the announcement on Saturday
*18:21.960- 18:23.720* :  in his state of the nation in speech.
*18:26.780- 18:29.780* :  The Hungarian child protection system must be strengthened.
*18:29.780- 18:32.520* :  The suffering of the victims means we must do this.
*18:32.900- 18:35.120* :  We must strengthen the leadership of the child protection
*18:35.120- 18:37.100* :  institutions and their supervision
*18:37.400- 18:38.980* :  and the rules about who can work there.
*18:39.340- 18:41.780* :  We will have to table all these together to Parliament
*18:41.780- 18:44.380* :  in the form of a new child protection law.
*18:45.060- 18:47.720* :  On Friday, tens of thousands of people had taken to the streets
*18:47.720- 18:50.320* :  to highlight the scandal which led to the resignation
*18:50.460- 18:52.160* :  of Mr Orburn's close ally,
*18:52.160- 18:54.700* :  the president, Kathleen Novak and two others.
*18:55.200- 18:57.360* :  I asked our Hungary correspondent Nick Thorpe
*18:57.360- 18:59.080* :  on a slightly wobbly telephone line.
*18:59.460- 19:02.660* :  Why were the people so angry that they took to the streets?
*19:03.300- 19:06.680* :  This is a scandal about the granting of clemency
*19:06.680- 19:08.900* :  by President Kutselin Novak
*19:09.280- 19:11.860* :  to the deputy head of an orphanage.
*19:12.240- 19:16.720* :  He had been sentenced to prison for covering up the crimes,
*19:16.720- 19:20.260* :  the sexual crimes against children of his direct
*19:20.320- 19:21.780* :  to the head of the orphanage.
*19:22.160- 19:24.200* :  It turned out earlier this month
*19:24.540- 19:26.720* :  that the clemency decision had been made
*19:27.220- 19:29.420* :  and obviously this was very, very controversial
*19:29.440- 19:30.160* :  for a government.
*19:30.160- 19:33.300* :  This caused a lot of confusion among government voters
*19:34.100- 19:37.140* :  and of course it led to these very high-level resignations.
*19:37.140- 19:38.120* :  So it was very bad.
*19:38.660- 19:39.740* :  As the Prime Minister also said,
*19:39.760- 19:42.220* :  this was a nightmarish start of the year
*19:42.220- 19:43.200* :  for him and his government.
*19:43.520- 19:45.900* :  And Nick, do you think what Mr Orburn said today
*19:45.900- 19:48.360* :  is done enough to draw a line under this politically?
*19:48.820- 19:50.460* :  That's his intention very much.
*19:50.560- 19:53.040* :  It's been very embarrassing for him this case.
*19:53.380- 19:56.760* :  He said that though he'd lost two very good people,
*19:56.760- 19:59.080* :  the two women in particular who'd resigned,
*19:59.080- 20:01.340* :  the president and the former Minister of Justice,
*20:01.720- 20:03.380* :  that their decision was a right one.
*20:03.400- 20:05.660* :  He says he wants to move beyond this,
*20:05.940- 20:07.560* :  firstly with those resignations.
*20:07.560- 20:11.420* :  Next with this package of far-reaching child protection laws
*20:12.040- 20:14.600* :  and thirdly with an amendment to the constitution
*20:15.000- 20:16.360* :  and a new president.
*20:16.900- 20:18.040* :  The opposition, of course,
*20:18.100- 20:20.620* :  four months ahead of June elections,
*20:20.620- 20:22.300* :  local and European elections.
*20:22.760- 20:24.680* :  They want to keep this issue going.
*20:24.680- 20:26.420* :  They want to keep it in the public eye.
*20:26.660- 20:27.920* :  They say there are lots of questions
*20:27.920- 20:29.200* :  that haven't been answered.
*20:29.580- 20:31.400* :  And also there have been revelations
*20:31.400- 20:34.080* :  or other allegations since the resignations
*20:34.420- 20:36.580* :  of high-level government corruption.
*20:36.780- 20:38.900* :  So a lot of things have sort of been thrown
*20:38.900- 20:41.840* :  into the public eye by this.
*20:42.380- 20:46.020* :  Nick Thorpe, one of Pakistan's top government officials
*20:46.020- 20:49.300* :  has been arrested after saying the election results last week
*20:49.300- 20:50.380* :  were manipulated.
*20:50.460- 20:53.960* :  He's taken full responsibility and says he should be punished.
*20:53.960- 20:55.720* :  The election commissioner, Pakistan,
*20:56.320- 20:57.940* :  has strongly rejected his claims.
*20:58.280- 21:00.320* :  Caroline Davis reports from Islamabad.
*21:00.860- 21:03.340* :  It's incredibly unusual for a Pakistan civil servant
*21:03.340- 21:04.340* :  to make this statement.
*21:04.340- 21:06.800* :  The Rao Pindi commissioner, Leakhet Ali Chata,
*21:07.180- 21:08.340* :  appeared at a press conference,
*21:08.740- 21:10.380* :  saying that he was resigning from his post
*21:10.380- 21:12.240* :  and has handed himself over to the police.
*21:12.520- 21:15.020* :  He accepted responsibility for bringing the election.
*21:15.520- 21:17.580* :  Pakistan's electoral commission has said
*21:17.580- 21:19.900* :  that the civil servant didn't have direct responsibilities
*21:19.900- 21:22.700* :  for the election and rejected Mr. Chatter's claims.
*21:23.200- 21:25.880* :  There has been no instruction to rig the vote they insisted.
*21:26.540- 21:29.400* :  Pakistan is still waiting for a new government to be formed.
*21:29.680- 21:31.240* :  Candidates backed by Imran Khan,
*21:31.640- 21:33.080* :  one more seats than anyone else,
*21:33.080- 21:34.700* :  but not enough for a majority.
*21:35.240- 21:36.840* :  His party has called on supporters
*21:36.840- 21:38.240* :  to protest around the country
*21:38.640- 21:41.180* :  against what it alleges to have been a stolen election.
*21:41.940- 21:42.640* :  Caroline Davis.
*21:43.600- 21:47.280* :  Now, have you ever tried knitting to de-stress after a long day?
*21:47.880- 21:49.760* :  Well, the textile craft takes center stage
*21:49.760- 21:52.500* :  in an eight-minute movie called Visible Mending,
*21:52.500- 21:55.720* :  which has been nominated for best short animation
*21:55.740- 21:58.640* :  at Sunday's British Academy Film Awards in London,
*21:58.640- 22:00.160* :  also known as the BAFTAs.
*22:00.560- 22:02.220* :  Director Sam Moore wanted to find out
*22:02.220- 22:04.660* :  if the craft of knitting can bring a sense of calm
*22:04.660- 22:06.060* :  to people's mental health.
*22:06.540- 22:07.540* :  Vince and Dowd reports.
*22:10.520- 22:15.080* :  People, they need something that's for them,
*22:15.700- 22:17.320* :  just a concentrate on.
*22:18.200- 22:19.980* :  It doesn't matter what you make,
*22:19.980- 22:21.940* :  however hideous it is.
*22:22.780- 22:25.940* :  Knitting wall in a bright orange ball rolls into view
*22:26.320- 22:28.960* :  and it's picked up in the film by a grey mouse
*22:29.360- 22:30.620* :  also made of wall.
*22:31.140- 22:32.740* :  There's something about, you know,
*22:32.740- 22:35.800* :  when your life is sort of falling apart,
*22:35.800- 22:38.880* :  you need to have creative purpose in it for yourself.
*22:39.180- 22:41.400* :  And if that purpose is quite small,
*22:41.400- 22:42.280* :  it doesn't matter.
*22:42.280- 22:44.040* :  Something tangible.
*22:44.480- 22:46.220* :  Director Sam Moore has been working
*22:46.220- 22:50.060* :  on the BAFTA-nominated film Visible Mending for six years.
*22:50.500- 22:52.860* :  It's in a combination of animated styles
*22:52.860- 22:55.480* :  with a soundtrack of interview clips
*22:55.480- 22:58.260* :  with the knitting addicts she tracked down.
*22:58.720- 23:00.920* :  When my mom was diagnosed with early onset dementia
*23:00.920- 23:02.320* :  in her early 60s,
*23:02.500- 23:05.020* :  I realized the role that knitting had played
*23:05.140- 23:07.180* :  and we're still playing helping her brain
*23:07.260- 23:08.320* :  to make sense of the world.
*23:08.740- 23:11.360* :  And I went and visited lots of knitting groups
*23:11.420- 23:14.160* :  who I chatted to about what knitting meant to them.
*23:14.480- 23:17.300* :  Pete Johnson is a former radio producer.
*23:17.600- 23:20.220* :  Johnson signed up to record many of the voices,
*23:20.740- 23:22.880* :  including that of his own wife, Kate.
*23:23.320- 23:26.360* :  She used to use knitting not only to construct garments
*23:26.360- 23:28.900* :  and little creatures and all sorts of things,
*23:29.260- 23:32.640* :  but also it was an emotional haven for her.
*23:32.640- 23:34.860* :  She suffered from depression for quite a few years
*23:35.580- 23:37.780* :  and she found that knitting a release.
*23:38.400- 23:41.500* :  When Kate Johnson realized she was dying of cancer,
*23:41.860- 23:44.160* :  she asked Sam Moore if she could record
*23:44.160- 23:46.540* :  extra final thoughts for the film
*23:46.960- 23:48.840* :  on the importance of knitting to her
*23:48.880- 23:51.120* :  even as life ebbed away.
*23:51.600- 23:53.120* :  I mean, I have terminal cancer.
*23:53.120- 23:57.240* :  And I am not really on the ball sometimes
*23:57.240- 24:00.140* :  and my energy levels are really low.
*24:00.420- 24:01.780* :  That was the thing with me,
*24:01.780- 24:04.360* :  although I couldn't do the things I wanted to do.
*24:04.920- 24:06.580* :  I could still knit and crochet
*24:06.580- 24:09.100* :  and just little things and think,
*24:09.240- 24:10.040* :  well, I've done that.
*24:13.160- 24:15.060* :  Kate died in 2022.
*24:16.020- 24:19.660* :  Sam Moore's film crams more human experience
*24:19.660- 24:23.160* :  into eight minutes than many films do into two hours.
*24:23.160- 24:26.080* :  To Carmel Duggan, it's a craft classic.
*24:26.360- 24:28.880* :  It may get people looking at knitting
*24:28.880- 24:33.780* :  and craft work in general as a therapeutic thing,
*24:33.780- 24:36.080* :  which it was always.
*24:36.500- 24:38.780* :  It gives you problem-solving skills,
*24:39.560- 24:41.920* :  confidence in your own abilities to do things,
*24:42.520- 24:46.440* :  and there's a great sense of satisfaction at the end of it.
