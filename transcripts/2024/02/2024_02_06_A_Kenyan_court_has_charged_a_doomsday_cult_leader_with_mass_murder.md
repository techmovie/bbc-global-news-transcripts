*01:47.640- 01:48.780* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:48.780- 01:53.000* :  This edition is recorded at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 6th of February.
*01:53.000- 01:57.120* :  The leader of a doomsday cult in Kenya is charged with mass murder,
*01:57.600- 02:00.520* :  accused of persuading his followers to starve themselves to death.
*02:01.260- 02:05.640* :  A year on from the devastating earthquake in Turkey, there are protests over the slow pace
*02:05.660- 02:09.980* :  of reconstruction, and Spanish farmers join the Europe-wide protests.
*02:12.620- 02:17.820* :  Also in the podcast, the British Prime Minister gives it an update on King Charles's cancer diagnosis.
*02:17.820- 02:21.740* :  Thankfully, this has been called early, and now everyone will be wishing him
*02:21.740- 02:26.440* :  that he gets a reward for the treatment that he needs and makes a full recovery.
*02:27.100- 02:30.740* :  And why, Murray, protesters are angry with the government in New Zealand.
*02:35.320- 02:40.160* :  In April last year, a grizzly story emerged from the Shakahola forest in eastern Kenya,
*02:40.160- 02:46.080* :  as police began investigating a remote cult led by the self-styled pastor Paul McKenzie.
*02:46.080- 02:50.200* :  They found dozens of shallow graves and people who were starving.
*02:50.900- 02:54.040* :  Eventually, they recovered 429 bodies.
*02:54.480- 02:57.520* :  Autopsies revealed that most of the victims had died of hunger.
*02:57.520- 03:04.560* :  Today, Mr McKenzie and 29 suspected associates have gone on trial charged with nearly 200 murders.
*03:05.240- 03:09.500* :  Prosecutors say he ordered his followers to starve themselves and their children to death,
*03:10.020- 03:10.980* :  so they could go to heaven.
*03:11.460- 03:14.260* :  Questions have been raised about how he evaded law enforcement,
*03:14.260- 03:16.300* :  despite facing previous charges.
*03:16.960- 03:20.800* :  Our senior Africa correspondent Anne Saway told me what happened in court.
*03:21.460- 03:30.100* :  The 191 counts of murder that the self-styled preacher Paul McKenzie and 29 of his associates
*03:30.660- 03:34.960* :  have been charged this morning, and he denied all charges.
*03:35.480- 03:38.640* :  Previously, he's also been charged with committing acts of terror,
*03:38.960- 03:40.520* :  child cruelty and torture.
*03:41.320- 03:45.780* :  Already, he's serving a one-year sentence for producing and distributing films
*03:45.780- 03:49.920* :  that his videos of his controversial sermons without license,
*03:50.580- 03:54.160* :  so a litany of charges there that have been leveled against him.
*03:54.360- 03:56.420* :  Yeah, and remind us how we've got to this day.
*03:56.440- 03:58.900* :  He was, I think, first detained last year in April.
*03:59.580- 04:04.660* :  He was. He surrendered to police in April last year after reports emerged
*04:05.280- 04:08.420* :  about children who were fasting to death,
*04:09.020- 04:12.800* :  who were being starved people as well, and as the reports
*04:12.800- 04:15.380* :  got to the public, he surrendered to the police.
*04:15.380- 04:18.420* :  But previously, he was arrested in recent years again,
*04:18.420- 04:23.920* :  and there were similar accusations, but he was released on a small bond,
*04:24.420- 04:27.860* :  and that has led people to really complain about this.
*04:28.320- 04:32.540* :  Now, last year, the government exhumed more than 400 bodies,
*04:33.080- 04:36.760* :  most of them children, or followers of his charge,
*04:36.760- 04:40.240* :  who had allegedly been starving to death.
*04:40.380- 04:41.580* :  He denied these allegations.
*04:41.580- 04:44.880* :  He says that he never asked anyone to fast to death.
*04:44.880- 04:47.960* :  And what kind of sentence could he face if found guilty?
*04:48.440- 04:53.680* :  If found guilty in Kenya, he would be sentenced to life in prison,
*04:54.260- 04:56.360* :  and given the number of counts,
*04:56.420- 05:00.300* :  depending on how many the prosecutor is able to prove,
*05:00.900- 05:04.000* :  then it could be multiple life sentences.
*05:04.700- 05:06.080* :  And so in Kenya.
*05:06.940- 05:11.180* :  A year ago today, Turkey and Syria were hit by a series of devastating earthquakes
*05:11.180- 05:14.220* :  that left at least 56,000 people dead.
*05:15.040- 05:16.020* :  Before dawn this morning,
*05:16.020- 05:18.360* :  mourners in the ruined Turkish city of Antakia
*05:18.680- 05:21.120* :  marked the moment when their lives changed forever,
*05:21.680- 05:23.880* :  and made clear their anger with the authorities.
*05:30.800- 05:34.980* :  The Turkish health minister was loudly booed as he prepared to speak at one ceremony,
*05:34.980- 05:38.220* :  while the region's mayor also faced an angry crowd.
*05:38.960- 05:41.720* :  Despite promises from the Turkish president to rebuild,
*05:41.720- 05:44.540* :  many are angry that millions remain homeless.
*05:45.360- 05:48.940* :  Families are still living in tents with children going to make shift schools.
*05:48.980- 05:53.320* :  Our correspondent Anna Foster reported from Antakia a year ago,
*05:53.800- 05:55.460* :  and has been back to see the recovery effort.
*05:59.480- 06:04.280* :  Millions of lives changed forever on the night of the 6th of February, a year ago.
*06:04.980- 06:06.580* :  Muhammad's was just one of them.
*06:07.140- 06:12.840* :  Now three years old, he lost his parents, his home, and his right arm and leg.
*06:17.880- 06:20.260* :  Mostly, he crawls on his arm and leg.
*06:21.100- 06:25.140* :  His struggle will grow with him when he sees people walking on their feet,
*06:25.800- 06:30.400* :  while he only has one or using their arms while he does.
*06:33.880- 06:37.180* :  That's Jumah Haider, a doctor who's been looking after Muhammad.
*06:37.180- 06:42.200* :  The boy's parents, Hazar, a pharmacist, and Ahmad, who was an engineer,
*06:42.660- 06:45.380* :  fled from Syria to Turkey to escape the war.
*06:45.900- 06:48.640* :  When Muhammad was found five days after the earthquake,
*06:48.640- 06:51.460* :  he was still wrapped in his father's arms.
*06:52.380- 06:54.780* :  Dr Haider says, despite his struggles,
*06:55.280- 06:56.560* :  Muhammad is doing well.
*06:59.660- 07:00.540* :  There are some difficulties.
*07:01.500- 07:03.480* :  Sometimes he gets angry and cries,
*07:03.940- 07:05.740* :  then starts banging his head on the floor.
*07:06.440- 07:08.340* :  But in general, he is a social kid.
*07:08.980- 07:11.320* :  He behaves the same way anyone his age would.
*07:11.880- 07:13.720* :  He sleeps and plays like any other child.
*07:14.820- 07:17.180* :  Muhammad has just one surviving relative.
*07:17.640- 07:20.940* :  His aunt Manal, who was in Saudi Arabia when the quake happened,
*07:20.980- 07:25.520* :  but local Turkish laws mean she struggled to take him out of the country
*07:25.960- 07:28.040* :  or return herself to look after him.
*07:28.640- 07:31.640* :  So he's being cared for by a succession of volunteers.
*07:36.360- 07:40.200* :  The sound of heavy machinery still echoes around here.
*07:40.720- 07:46.980* :  Even after a year of solid work, they still haven't managed to fully clear this place.
*07:47.700- 07:51.380* :  It's flattened. There were just one or two buildings left standing,
*07:51.380- 07:54.460* :  but too badly damaged for anybody to live in.
*07:54.920- 07:59.320* :  You can see really starkly and clearly how the heart
*07:59.320- 08:06.120* :  has been ripped out of the city of Antakia and understand how it's so difficult for the survivors
*08:06.640- 08:10.180* :  to imagine what their life is going to look like here now.
*08:12.660- 08:14.640* :  Not far away in northern Syria,
*08:15.040- 08:19.720* :  a new camp was established for earthquake survivors whose lives were already bleak
*08:19.840- 08:21.460* :  after being displaced by the war.
*08:25.360- 08:27.300* :  Our conditions in the tents are poor.
*08:27.900- 08:31.100* :  In the winter, the rainwater enters the tents all the time.
*08:31.940- 08:34.080* :  In the summer, it's extremely hot.
*08:34.220- 08:35.940* :  The conditions are miserable.
*08:36.440- 08:37.380* :  There aren't any water.
*08:39.880- 08:42.360* :  The earthquake only added to serious problems.
*08:42.940- 08:47.620* :  Save the children says nearly 90% of the population there now needs aid.
*08:48.000- 08:51.320* :  The highest level since the war began 13 years ago.
*08:56.600- 09:01.000* :  In southern Turkey, finding somewhere to live is still one of the biggest problems.
*09:01.680- 09:05.300* :  Tents and container villages that sprang up as temporary solutions
*09:05.820- 09:08.460* :  now look far more permanent than was ever intended.
*09:09.460- 09:12.880* :  Just under 50,000 new homes have been built so far.
*09:13.160- 09:15.360* :  That's less than a quarter of what was promised.
*09:15.380- 09:19.600* :  The Turkish government says the scale of the task has made it slow.
*09:20.220- 09:25.820* :  But even a year after the earthquakes, there's still a long way to go to rebuild both homes
*09:26.340- 09:27.340* :  and lives here.
*09:28.260- 09:30.780* :  Anna Foster in the Turkish city of Antakia.
*09:31.400- 09:36.980* :  Father Tony O'Ridin from the Jesuit refugee service lives in the Syrian city of Aleppo
*09:37.420- 09:40.660* :  and led the earthquake response there, helping about a thousand families
*09:40.660- 09:41.900* :  forced to leave their homes.
*09:42.560- 09:45.280* :  He's been talking to Rob Young about the situation now.
*09:45.820- 09:48.180* :  So when the earthquake hit here just over a year ago,
*09:48.420- 09:52.760* :  one of the significant impacts apart from the collapsing buildings
*09:52.760- 09:59.240* :  and the killing of thousands of people was the impact on the psychological state of people
*09:59.240- 10:04.680* :  because the earthquake was citywide and it shattered the sense of safety.
*10:05.300- 10:11.800* :  So this added to the compound state of people after 12 years of the civil war
*10:12.360- 10:17.240* :  and it displaced thousands of people over 50,000 people had to leave their homes.
*10:18.440- 10:22.580* :  The majority of those have now returned but there are still a significant number of people
*10:23.240- 10:26.180* :  who shelter situation is very, very dire.
*10:26.800- 10:32.960* :  In the context of continuing deterioration of the life conditions of people here,
*10:32.960- 10:39.580* :  access to food, access to healthcare, access to income, all of these things have deteriorated.
*10:39.580- 10:45.240* :  So the aid we have been delivering in response to the earthquake has been done on a treadmill
*10:45.240- 10:46.760* :  of a worsening situation.
*10:47.280- 10:50.540* :  So the people of Aleppo find themselves in a worse situation.
*10:50.540- 10:56.280* :  I'm afraid one year on and in a context as well where the funds for humanitarian work is shrinking
*10:56.280- 11:01.280* :  as the needs surge, the available resources unfortunately are shrinking.
*11:01.680- 11:05.800* :  So what is it like for people who've stayed in Aleppo? What is daily life like there?
*11:06.760- 11:12.680* :  It's a struggle, the struggle for survival knowing whether they will have enough food today,
*11:13.300- 11:18.340* :  sometimes mothers are faced with do they feed their children or do they get the needed medicine
*11:18.340- 11:22.900* :  to heal them, often deny themselves either food or medicine for themselves.
*11:23.660- 11:28.920* :  Wondering what tomorrow will bring the mentality is that things continue to get worse.
*11:28.940- 11:34.400* :  So people are under a lot of strain and this is why our creation of safe spaces and psychological
*11:34.520- 11:39.880* :  interventions are so important to try and maintain resilience and positive coping mechanisms.
*11:40.480- 11:46.540* :  People are also living of course in the dark at night time because of the inadequacy of electricity.
*11:46.540- 11:49.480* :  Most people live with one or two hours a day.
*11:50.040- 11:56.480* :  So hunger, darkness, despair, these are the daily realities of thousands of people in Aleppo.
*11:57.100- 11:59.060* :  Father Tony O'Ridham in Syria.
*12:00.120- 12:04.880* :  The Netherlands, France, Germany all have been hit by protests from angry farmers,
*12:05.240- 12:07.520* :  now tractor disruption has reached Spain.
*12:13.140- 12:16.840* :  The Spanish farmers have similar concerns to their counterparts across Europe
*12:16.880- 12:20.120* :  and they are warning that today's roadblocks are just the beginning.
*12:20.500- 12:26.080* :  We will block the road indefinitely and no truck will get through on any of the motorways.
*12:26.640- 12:28.000* :  Until they pay attention to us.
*12:28.420- 12:31.020* :  Pay us what is due and make the red tape easier.
*12:32.420- 12:34.360* :  So how bad is the disruption in Spain?
*12:34.360- 12:36.880* :  I asked Darkora Spondent there, Guy Hedgeko.
*12:37.520- 12:40.500* :  Where I am, Oliver in the town of Arranda, they're the wayro,
*12:41.220- 12:45.060* :  which is a couple of hours north of Madrid, it's been quite noticeable.
*12:45.060- 12:47.560* :  I mean there have been hundreds of tractors driving through the town.
*12:47.560- 12:51.060* :  It's quite a small place so it has just disrupted the traffic.
*12:51.620- 12:52.920* :  A great deal here.
*12:53.480- 12:55.240* :  That has varied in other parts of the country.
*12:55.240- 12:59.340* :  Some places there has been a lot of disruption to people driving in their cars.
*12:59.340- 13:05.120* :  Other places not so much, but it has been a protest which has been noticed across the country.
*13:05.440- 13:09.860* :  Yeah and when the farmers in France took action they tried to blockade Paris for a couple of days.
*13:09.860- 13:12.620* :  What's the plan for the farmers in Spain?
*13:13.360- 13:17.000* :  Well what they're saying is they're going to continue doing these sort of protests in different parts
*13:17.020- 13:24.180* :  of Spain, mainly the sort of farming heartland areas such as where I am, which is sort of towards
*13:24.180- 13:27.740* :  northern Spain. It's a major farming area here.
*13:27.740- 13:31.660* :  They're going to keep doing that in this area and other areas over the next few days.
*13:31.660- 13:37.840* :  And then later on in February they say they're actually going to arrive in central Madrid and
*13:37.840- 13:42.060* :  they're going to go to the doors of the agricultural minister there to try and then negotiate.
*13:42.160- 13:47.140* :  So they say that unless things change a great deal or the government can offer them
*13:47.140- 13:50.940* :  something which really impresses them they're going to push ahead with that plan.
*13:51.180- 13:55.180* :  Yeah now we know farmers across Europe are unhappy at the moment. What are the specific
*13:55.180- 14:00.840* :  complaints of the Spanish ones? They believe that the European Union's farming regulations are too
*14:00.840- 14:07.120* :  tight. They constrict farmers and make it difficult for them to make a profit and that pushes their
*14:07.120- 14:12.400* :  costs up and they're just simply too much red tape. So they're upset about that but they also
*14:12.400- 14:18.920* :  look to other countries that don't have to face that kind of bureaucracy outside the European
*14:18.920- 14:23.380* :  Union. So for example they talk a lot about Morocco to the south. They say Morocco is not part
*14:23.380- 14:27.140* :  of the European Union. It doesn't have to go through all these very strict environmental
*14:27.140- 14:33.660* :  and sanitary controls that we have to and yet its produce seems to come into Spain and other
*14:33.660- 14:37.960* :  countries in the European Union without any problem and therefore they managed to undercut
*14:37.960- 14:43.460* :  Spanish produce. So they want to see more controls for those sort of countries. The other thing
*14:43.460- 14:48.000* :  they're upset about is the drought in Spain which has been very serious in many parts of the country
*14:48.000- 14:52.440* :  and they want the government to take measures to try and alleviate the impact of the drought.
*14:52.800- 14:59.140* :  Guy headscope talking to us from Spain. On this day in 1840 a treaty was signed in
*14:59.140- 15:04.660* :  Waitangi in New Zealand to establish British governance while guaranteeing the rights of Indigenous
*15:04.660- 15:10.360* :  Marries. But this year's official commemoration of Waitangi Day has been marked by protests.
*15:15.440- 15:20.060* :  The demonstrators are angry that the new conservative coalition in New Zealand wants to review
*15:20.060- 15:25.820* :  the treaty as part of plans to undo policies protecting Indigenous rights. Our correspondent
*15:25.820- 15:30.500* :  Phil Mercer spoke to us from Sydney starting with the significance of the agreement.
*15:31.300- 15:36.680* :  Well it's the founding document of modern New Zealand. It guides the relationship between
*15:36.680- 15:43.800* :  Indigenous people, the Maori community and the government's now protesters are accusing
*15:43.800- 15:52.060* :  the country's centre-right governing coalition of wanting to degrade the treaty of Waitangi
*15:52.060- 15:59.320* :  and hundreds of protesters have marched in opposition to propose government policies at Waitangi.
*15:59.740- 16:06.320* :  It's a seaside community and there there have been commemoration and celebrations of the treaty
*16:06.320- 16:16.700* :  signed in 1840 and also these large protests by hundreds of people. So certainly a very active day
*16:16.700- 16:20.660* :  in that part of New Zealand. Yeah tell us about the disagreements. What is the government
*16:20.660- 16:26.280* :  trying to do? What are the policies that it wants to undo? Well the centre-right government of
*16:26.280- 16:33.580* :  the Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wants to bring in a bill to Parliament to reinterpret some
*16:33.580- 16:41.020* :  of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and reassess how it supplies in an increasingly
*16:41.020- 16:48.340* :  multicultural society. There is anger at the bill. Maori campaigners say it would be the most
*16:48.340- 16:55.120* :  significant backward step for Indigenous rights in decades. There is a lot of politics at play here.
*16:55.120- 17:00.680* :  The government says that it is supporting the introduction of the bill into the New Zealand Parliament
*17:00.680- 17:07.860* :  by one of the junior coalition partners but the government or the Prime Minister Christopher Luxon
*17:07.860- 17:13.340* :  doesn't believe that the bill will actually be passed. He says he just wants to generate a
*17:13.340- 17:19.240* :  conversation about the future direction and interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi but
*17:19.240- 17:25.560* :  it's safe to say Maori campaigners in New Zealand believe that their fundamental rights are at stake
*17:25.560- 17:30.520* :  here. We've seen weeks of protest and we're likely to see many more in the future.

*19:40.140- 19:44.800* :  When he visited Saudi Arabia yesterday, America's top diplomat Anthony Blinken spoke about
*19:44.800- 19:50.980* :  efforts to, quote, achieve an enduring end to the conflict in Gaza. Today, the US Secretary of
*19:50.980- 19:56.260* :  State is in Egypt, before going on to Qatar and then Israel itself. So what can he do to bring an
*19:56.260- 20:01.720* :  end to the war, even as Israel says it plans to target RAFA despite the huge numbers of Palestinians
*20:01.720- 20:06.660* :  who fled there to escape the fighting? And how can he secure the release of Israeli hostages
*20:07.040- 20:13.040* :  still detained by Hamas? First, I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem, Nick Beek, what Mr Blinken would
*20:13.040- 20:17.720* :  be seeking from his meetings in Egypt? Egypt has been really crucial in what's been happening,
*20:17.720- 20:26.200* :  notably in terms of getting aid into Gaza, of course, Egypt to the south of Gaza. But also,
*20:26.200- 20:32.620* :  it's very important in what they're trying to do at the moment in finding the terms of a cease
*20:32.680- 20:38.840* :  fire. Egypt and also Qatar. And so that's why Secretary Blinken is going to those two countries,
*20:38.840- 20:46.200* :  because they basically are the intermediaries between Hamas and Israel. We had these peace talks
*20:46.200- 20:52.160* :  in Paris about 10 days ago now, and the outline of a deal was sort of thrashed out. And what's
*20:52.160- 20:57.800* :  happened now is that this has been put to Hamas. And we're waiting for Hamas to come forward with
*20:57.800- 21:02.660* :  what they think basically about this deal that has been put forward. So, yeah, Egypt really
*21:02.660- 21:07.120* :  key today, so important discussions in Cairo. Yeah, we're waiting for Hamas. There are reported
*21:07.120- 21:13.200* :  to be divisions amongst the leadership there. Also, divisions in Israel itself, tell us about those.
*21:15.120- 21:20.940* :  Yeah, there are. And particularly in Israel, these divisions are within the government here,
*21:20.940- 21:26.840* :  and they've been played out very publicly. Specifically, you've got members of the government
*21:26.840- 21:31.640* :  right wing ministers who've said that they'll basically collapse the government. They'll walk away
*21:31.640- 21:37.760* :  if they don't like a peace deal that is decided upon. And specifically what they're talking about
*21:38.180- 21:45.240* :  is the idea that hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli prisons at the same
*21:45.240- 21:52.200* :  time that the hostages who were taken by Hamas on October 7th are released from Gaza. They don't
*21:52.200- 21:56.660* :  like that, that the right wing members of the government here, but the thing is this was the
*21:56.660- 22:02.800* :  sort of the format, the framework, that enabled the first wave of captives to be released back in
*22:02.800- 22:09.760* :  November when there was some pause in the fighting, which enabled people to be freed. So,
*22:09.760- 22:14.080* :  we'll have to wait and see what's happening. All these conversations are taking place behind
*22:14.080- 22:19.300* :  closed doors. It's hard to assess at what point we're at at the moment, but it may well be that
*22:19.440- 22:23.400* :  there is very quickly movement, but certainly we're not getting any signs of any imminent breakthrough.
*22:23.760- 22:28.460* :  And looking at the broader region briefly, more attacks claimed by the Houthis in the Red Sea.
*22:28.620- 22:32.780* :  It looks like the US and British deterrent doesn't appear to be working at the moment.
*22:33.740- 22:38.440* :  Now with the Houthis say they'll continue to hit targets in the Red Sea. They say they're
*22:38.580- 22:44.580* :  aiming for British, Israeli, American vessels in particular, and they say they're doing this in
*22:44.580- 22:50.220* :  solidarity with the people of Gaza, and that they won't let up until Israeli troops have withdrawn.
*22:51.400- 22:56.780* :  We hear overnight that there's been an attack on another vessel. The Americans are saying that they
*22:56.780- 23:03.420* :  are really trying to take out the capacity that the Houthis have to fire these missiles,
*23:03.420- 23:07.640* :  but as we've seen, it seems they've got a long way to go before they completely eradicate
*23:07.640- 23:10.520* :  that threat, Oliver. Nickbeak in Jerusalem.
*23:11.640- 23:15.900* :  King's cancer shocked just one of the headlines here in the UK this morning
*23:15.900- 23:20.640* :  as all the newspapers led on the news that Charles III had been diagnosed with the disease.
*23:20.740- 23:24.540* :  Buckingham Palace didn't reveal which type of cancer the king has,
*23:25.000- 23:29.680* :  other than to say it is not prostate cancer. The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunat gave his
*23:29.680- 23:35.460* :  reaction to the BBC's Rachel Burden. Well, obviously like everyone else, you're shocked and sad,
*23:35.460- 23:40.800* :  and just all our thoughts are with him and his family, and thankfully this has been
*23:40.800- 23:47.320* :  called early, and now everyone will be wishing him that he gets the treatment that he needs and
*23:47.360- 23:51.980* :  makes a full recovery. I think that's what we're all hoping and praying for, and I'm of course
*23:51.980- 23:56.900* :  in regular contact with him, and we'll continue to communicate with him as normal.
*23:57.200- 23:59.860* :  Practically speaking, what does it mean for the day-to-day running of the country?
*24:00.100- 24:05.140* :  No, I think I'm in regular contact with the King, and that will of course continue as normal,
*24:05.140- 24:09.160* :  and we'll crack on with everything, but he'll just know he'll be in our thoughts and our prayers,
*24:09.160- 24:13.660* :  many families around the country who have listened to this, will have been touched by the same
*24:13.740- 24:18.520* :  thing, and they know what it means for everyone, so we'll just be willing him on, and hopefully
*24:18.520- 24:21.960* :  we'll get through this as quickly as possible. Have you spoken to him? I'm in regular contact
*24:21.960- 24:26.560* :  with him, and we'll continue to be so during this. And does that mean your meetings face-to-face
*24:26.560- 24:32.060* :  will continue? So yeah, no, I mean, we don't try to get into the details, but I'm in regular contact
*24:32.060- 24:35.440* :  with him, as I always am, and that will absolutely continue.
*24:35.860- 24:40.540* :  Richie Suna, our correspondent Charlotte Gallagher, is outside Buckingham Palace. What did she
*24:40.540- 24:45.240* :  make of the update from the British Prime Minister? We hadn't been told that by the palace that
*24:45.240- 24:48.920* :  the cancer had been caught early. All we'd been told was that he'd been diagnosed with cancer.
*24:49.400- 24:54.260* :  It had been found when he was being treated for an enlarged prostate. It wasn't prostate cancer,
*24:54.260- 24:59.060* :  they said, but they didn't say what type of cancer it was or what kind of treatment he was having.
*24:59.060- 25:04.000* :  We now know that it will be outpatient treatment, so he'll be going back and forth from hospital
*25:04.000- 25:09.120* :  to his residence in London, just a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. And it'll also be
*25:09.120- 25:14.200* :  carrying out his constitutional work as head of state, so he'll still be reviewing documents,
*25:14.340- 25:19.040* :  reviewing paperwork, signing parliamentary bills, and also still having his weekly
*25:19.540- 25:23.940* :  meeting with the Prime Minister. So the behind-the-scenes work will still carry on, but of course,
*25:23.940- 25:28.220* :  we won't see him out and about doing public duties. Yeah, you mentioned the King's enlarged
*25:28.220- 25:34.560* :  prostate. The palace were quite open about that. Why are they not now revealing what cancer he has?
*25:34.900- 25:40.000* :  I think it's a privacy issue, really, Oliver. I mean, before, we probably, with previous
*25:40.580- 25:44.360* :  senior members of the Royal Family, wouldn't have been told this much detail that they'd been treated
*25:44.360- 25:49.880* :  for cancer or they'd been treated for an enlarged prostate. This is very unusual to get this level
*25:49.880- 25:55.460* :  of information from Buckingham Palace. Like all people, they're entitled to a level of privacy
*25:55.460- 26:00.300* :  surrounding their health, and perhaps the palace didn't want constant speculation about what
*26:00.300- 26:04.340* :  was wrong with the King. I think we can expect, perhaps, when his treatment is finished and he's
*26:04.340- 26:09.740* :  feeling well enough, he'll probably talk more openly, perhaps, about what type of cancer he has had,
*26:10.140- 26:13.420* :  given that when he talked about having an enlarged prostate, he said he did that to raise
*26:13.420- 26:18.500* :  public awareness. So that's obviously something that's really important to him, making people aware
*26:18.500- 26:23.660* :  of health conditions, and also showing solidarity with other people being treated for cancer or
*26:23.660- 26:28.340* :  prostate issues. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales returning to duties much early than planned,
*26:28.540- 26:33.620* :  after he was helping his wife with her recovery from abdominal surgery.
*26:35.740- 26:40.220* :  He is, Oliver, and perhaps Prince William would have been expecting a bit more time off from
*26:40.220- 26:44.240* :  public duties. The Princess of Wales isn't going to be seen in public, we don't think, until
*26:44.240- 26:47.800* :  after Easter, and they have three children, of course, to look after. But Prince William is
*26:47.800- 26:51.680* :  essentially having to step up and carry out some of those public duties that would have been done
*26:52.120- 26:56.060* :  by his father, the Queen as well, the King's wife, the Queen Camilla, she'll be doing more
*26:56.060- 27:01.140* :  public duties. Also, Prince Harry, he's on his way back to the UK, we think, he's been spotted,
*27:01.140- 27:06.440* :  his car has been spotted at Los Angeles Airport, and we think he is coming back to see his father,
*27:06.440- 27:10.600* :  they've not seen each other in person, we don't think, since the coronation almost a year ago.
*27:11.020- 27:15.520* :  Charlotte Gallagher at Buckingham Palace. The first global conference targeting so-called
*27:15.520- 27:21.300* :  hackers for hire and spyware is taking place in Britain. 35 nations are expected to attend the
*27:21.300- 27:25.600* :  event in London, along with companies involved in the sector. I heard more from our security
*27:25.600- 27:32.020* :  correspondent Gordon Carrera. Spyware are tools to effectively hack into someone's mobile phone
*27:32.020- 27:36.180* :  and turn it into a spy device, a surveillance device, collect information switch on the microphones
*27:36.180- 27:41.520* :  and so on. This has been developed by companies and often sold to governments, and governments are
*27:41.520- 27:47.160* :  supposed to use it if you like for law enforcement or national security, but we've seen growing
*27:47.160- 27:51.440* :  examples around the world, whether it's in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America,
*27:51.440- 27:57.640* :  of it being used, for instance, to spy on activists, political opponents, dissidents and journalists.
*27:58.320- 28:03.360* :  So that is a growing concern that these tools, which are commercially available, are being used
*28:03.720- 28:07.720* :  further and further afield and getting more and more advanced. Also, hackers for hire if you
*28:07.720- 28:12.900* :  like a mercenary hackers who might be hired by one company to hack into another. So this is seen
*28:12.900- 28:17.200* :  as a problem that's effectively growing, and this is an attempt to bring together different parties.
*28:17.200- 28:21.400* :  So in London, you've got 35 countries, you've also got some of the big tech companies,
*28:21.400- 28:25.640* :  but you've also got some of the companies which develop those tools, or they were not being told
*28:25.640- 28:30.240* :  exactly the names of those companies. And the idea is to try and bring together some kind of
*28:30.560- 28:34.600* :  oversight or framework to stop this really spiraling out of control.
*28:34.600- 28:39.920* :  So there might be what, some kind of regulation? Well, I think that's what's a bit unclear,
*28:39.920- 28:44.460* :  because so far we've seen piecemeal steps by some countries. So interestingly, the US
*28:44.500- 28:49.480* :  actually sanctioned and measures against one company, NSO Group, which had developed something
*28:49.480- 28:54.400* :  called Pegasus, which was one of the best known of these spyware tools. So you've seen some
*28:54.400- 28:58.600* :  countries take different actions, but I think the attempt is to try and come to some agreement
*28:58.600- 29:03.660* :  about who should be able to use them in what way. Now, whether we actually see concrete steps,
*29:03.660- 29:08.720* :  I'm not sure. And I think it's an attempt to do something, but I think we'll have to watch
*29:08.720- 29:14.720* :  very closely to see whether countries and companies are really able to agree on what the limits are
*29:15.020- 29:18.780* :  for how this can be used, because you can imagine that different countries will have different
*29:18.780- 29:23.640* :  ideas of what our legitimate targets for them to go after. So I think it could be quite challenging.
*29:24.160- 29:29.440* :  To go to correspondent Gordon Carrera, scientists have identified a new species of giant flying
*29:29.440- 29:34.500* :  reptile that lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. The fossil found on the Scottish island of
*29:34.500- 29:41.620* :  Skye in 2006 is a type of terrasaur that lived more than 160 million years ago. Most terrasaur's
*29:41.620- 29:46.620* :  from this period were thought to have been in China. Dr. Liz Martin Silverstone, a paleontologist
*29:46.620- 29:50.420* :  at the University of Bristol, explained why it took so long to identify.
*29:51.220- 29:56.160* :  The area that it's found in on the Isle of Skye has very, very hard rock, and it was found on
*29:56.160- 30:01.760* :  a boulder that had fallen down from the cliff face. And that boulder, first you had to remove it
*30:01.760- 30:07.160* :  from the boulder, and then the rock itself, when it was first found, you could only see one or two
*30:07.160- 30:12.320* :  bones on the surface after spending many, many hours getting it down to the point where we could see
*30:12.320- 30:18.620* :  more like 10 or 15 bones on the surface. Then I actually put it into a CT scanner, and we were
*30:18.620- 30:23.360* :  able to find more things within the rock from that as well. The fossil itself is still within the
*30:23.360- 30:27.600* :  rock, because it's so fragile, we actually can't remove it. So everything is still in the block
*30:27.600- 30:31.900* :  itself. It's a fairly complete terrasaur. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a skull, but we do have
*30:31.900- 30:38.040* :  most of the wings and quite a lot of legs and some of the vertebrae, the backbone. And with that,
*30:38.040- 30:43.760* :  comparing it to other terrasaur's, we could see it had sort of unique features that other terrasaur's
*30:43.760- 30:49.020* :  didn't have. So that's how we knew that it was a new species. We agreed on the name trying to come
*30:49.020- 30:54.040* :  up with something that could sort of honor its Scottish background. So it's called the keyoptera.
*30:54.660- 31:00.920* :  Keyoptera Evansay. So keyoptera comes from Elena Kio, which is the name, the Gallic name for
*31:00.920- 31:07.360* :  the Isle of Sky. And then Evansay honors professor Susan Evans, who is a paleontologist who's
