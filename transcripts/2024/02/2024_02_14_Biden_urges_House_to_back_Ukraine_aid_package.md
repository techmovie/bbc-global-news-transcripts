*00:00.000- 00:02.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.340- 00:07.360* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Wednesday,
*00:07.360- 00:09.600* :  the 14th of February, these are our main stories.
*00:09.700- 00:13.700* :  The US Senate passes a $95 billion aid package.
*00:14.040- 00:15.420* :  Most of it will go to Ukraine.
*00:15.420- 00:18.760* :  President Biden has this message for House Republicans.
*00:19.540- 00:20.420* :  History is watching.
*00:20.900- 00:22.040* :  Failure to support Ukraine.
*00:22.040- 00:24.300* :  This critical moment will never be forgotten.
*00:25.540- 00:28.080* :  We hear from the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*00:28.080- 00:31.360* :  where a rebel group is closing in on the city of Goma.
*00:31.760- 00:32.180* :  And...
*00:40.420- 00:44.180* :  ...worrying new evidence of how global warming is threatening polar bears.
*00:47.060- 00:47.940* :  Also in this podcast,
*00:48.120- 00:51.500* :  could and Israeli ground offensive in Rafa be avoided
*00:52.000- 00:53.960* :  following more ceasefire talks in Egypt?
*00:59.140- 01:01.080* :  Previously, we just said Pakistani audience.
*01:01.120- 01:05.200* :  Now we have people from the UK, Brazil, China, so it feels very good.
*01:05.700- 01:09.460* :  The Pakistani pop group making global waves, thanks to some help,
*01:09.880- 01:11.560* :  from the British star, Zane Malik.
*01:15.040- 01:17.000* :  After months of political wrangling,
*01:17.000- 01:20.920* :  the US Senate has approved a $95 billion aid package,
*01:21.460- 01:23.840* :  predominantly for Ukraine, but also for Israel,
*01:23.840- 01:25.940* :  Palestinian civilians and Taiwan.
*01:26.060- 01:28.720* :  The Senate had previously been divided,
*01:28.720- 01:33.280* :  but this time some Republicans joined forces with Democrats to pass it easily.
*01:33.280- 01:37.460* :  But the bill now heads to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
*01:38.040- 01:41.680* :  President Biden urged Republicans in Congress to support the bill
*01:42.120- 01:44.860* :  and funding for Ukraine in its crucial time of need.
*01:45.320- 01:48.800* :  The stakes this fight extend far beyond Ukraine.
*01:48.800- 01:52.740* :  If we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine,
*01:52.740- 01:55.380* :  he won't limit himself just to Ukraine.
*01:55.840- 01:59.240* :  And the cost for America and our allies and partners are going to rise.
*01:59.500- 02:02.840* :  For Republicans in Congress who think they can oppose funding for Ukraine
*02:02.840- 02:05.680* :  and not be held accountable, history is watching.
*02:05.840- 02:09.380* :  Failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten.
*02:10.040- 02:13.760* :  The majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, pleaded with the House Speaker,
*02:13.760- 02:16.220* :  Mike Johnson, to not block its passage.
*02:16.620- 02:19.460* :  I call on Speaker Johnson to rise to the occasion,
*02:20.060- 02:23.540* :  to do the right thing, bring this bill to the floor.
*02:23.540- 02:28.260* :  It is clear that if our bill is brought to the floor, it will pass.
*02:29.020- 02:30.900* :  But if the hard right kills this bill,
*02:30.900- 02:34.680* :  it would be an enormous gift to Vladimir Putin.
*02:35.040- 02:37.440* :  It would be a betrayal of our partners and allies
*02:38.100- 02:40.560* :  and an abandonment of our service members.
*02:41.260- 02:44.120* :  Chuck Schumer, so does Mike Johnson have the power
*02:44.120- 02:46.220* :  to stop this aid bill from being passed?
*02:46.660- 02:48.740* :  I wasn't in correspondent, is Nomiya Ikbal.
*02:49.060- 02:51.620* :  He very much does, and he's almost indicated
*02:51.620- 02:56.040* :  that that is likely to happen that it might not reach the floor for a vote.
*02:56.040- 02:59.560* :  So we could be in a situation where it might be weeks or months
*02:59.560- 03:03.180* :  before Congress sends the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk if at all.
*03:03.560- 03:06.560* :  What Mr Johnson has to do, he has to decide whether to bring the package
*03:06.560- 03:08.860* :  to a vote in the chamber, attempt to amend it,
*03:08.860- 03:11.440* :  send it back to the Senate or just ignore it entirely.
*03:11.900- 03:15.020* :  And of course, remember, Mr Johnson, he's facing huge pressure
*03:15.020- 03:17.460* :  from those Republicans that are very closely aligned
*03:17.460- 03:19.020* :  to the former president, Donald Trump.
*03:19.720- 03:23.280* :  And Donald Trump, he's likely to be the Republican presidential candidate.
*03:23.760- 03:25.680* :  He wants to kill this bill.
*03:25.680- 03:28.940* :  He doesn't believe in any more support for Ukraine.
*03:28.940- 03:31.340* :  So we just have to wait and see what happens next.
*03:31.580- 03:33.800* :  And Nomiya, what do you think if anything
*03:33.800- 03:36.560* :  could change the mind of Mr Johnson
*03:36.960- 03:39.320* :  and the other pro-Trump members of the House?
*03:40.080- 03:44.800* :  Basically, this legislation was passed after Republicans blocked this broader bill last week,
*03:44.800- 03:48.860* :  and that would have combined foreign aid with a bipartisan border deal.
*03:49.480- 03:52.660* :  So Republicans wanted the border security to be part of the bill,
*03:52.660- 03:55.420* :  but then they went on to reject the bipartisan border deal.
*03:56.020- 03:58.880* :  And that was following these attacks by Donald Trump, top House Republicans.
*03:59.360- 04:02.820* :  So if suddenly they combine border security with it,
*04:03.340- 04:04.140* :  that might change things.
*04:04.140- 04:06.620* :  But what the Republicans want, the more extreme Republicans
*04:06.620- 04:08.820* :  is very much old with what a lot the Democrats want.
*04:09.300- 04:10.980* :  It's really hard to see what will happen
*04:10.980- 04:14.580* :  because Donald Trump sort of shadow looms over a lot of this.
*04:14.580- 04:16.460* :  I mean, Mr Johnson denies that.
*04:16.460- 04:19.560* :  He said that, you know, it's Donald Trump isn't having any influence,
*04:19.680- 04:22.980* :  but it's hard to see how that's not the case.
*04:23.400- 04:24.980* :  You mentioned Chuck Schumer there.
*04:25.120- 04:26.900* :  He has basically said it's up to the House,
*04:27.060- 04:29.600* :  and he said it's up to them to save democracies.
*04:29.600- 04:32.500* :  So he's really laying out what he thinks is at stake here.
*04:32.620- 04:34.440* :  Nomiya, there are certain things in the bill,
*04:34.440- 04:36.660* :  like money for Taiwan, money for Israel,
*04:37.060- 04:39.660* :  that you'd imagine a lot of Republicans would support.
*04:40.360- 04:43.660* :  And yet, do you think the situation is not going to budge,
*04:43.660- 04:47.620* :  even though the money will just disappear for those causes as well?
*04:47.940- 04:50.480* :  It doesn't look like that's going to happen at the moment.
*04:50.480- 04:52.760* :  I mean, like I said, they either have to bring the package
*04:52.760- 04:54.740* :  to a vote in that chain or attempt to amend it,
*04:54.740- 04:56.660* :  send it back to the Senate, ignore it entirely.
*04:57.040- 04:58.940* :  Do you remember also that there were two Democrats
*04:58.940- 05:01.240* :  who voted against the package as well?
*05:01.660- 05:03.640* :  They cited deep concerns over supporting
*05:03.640- 05:06.720* :  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's military campaign.
*05:07.380- 05:08.680* :  Also Senator Bernie Sanders,
*05:08.680- 05:11.160* :  he's independently does caucus with the Democrats,
*05:11.720- 05:14.720* :  and he also voted against it for the same reason.
*05:14.720- 05:16.740* :  So we have to see what happens next.
*05:17.220- 05:18.620* :  Nomiya Igbal in Washington.
*05:19.620- 05:21.880* :  Ukraine will be watching the House of Representatives
*05:22.560- 05:23.560* :  closely in the coming days.
*05:24.100- 05:24.840* :  So will Moscow?
*05:25.500- 05:29.540* :  Research suggests Russia's military has lost more than 3,000 tanks
*05:29.540- 05:30.940* :  since invading Ukraine,
*05:31.440- 05:33.760* :  equivalent to the number it had when the war began.
*05:34.520- 05:36.920* :  The International Institute for Strategic Studies says
*05:36.920- 05:40.200* :  Russia has the vehicles in reserve to replace losses for years,
*05:40.560- 05:41.960* :  but at a lower quality.
*05:42.340- 05:43.880* :  The think tank says the war in Ukraine,
*05:43.880- 05:45.820* :  as well as other global conflicts,
*05:45.820- 05:48.220* :  has driven defense spending to new highs.
*05:48.800- 05:50.940* :  Here's our security correspondent, Frank Gardner.
*05:51.360- 05:53.960* :  Over the last 12 months says the report published today,
*05:53.960- 05:56.920* :  the world has entered a new and more dangerous period.
*05:57.660- 05:59.620* :  Conflicts raging in Ukraine in the Middle East
*05:59.620- 06:02.520* :  have helped drive up global defense spending to record levels.
*06:03.220- 06:05.540* :  The report finds that, apart from the US,
*06:06.120- 06:09.340* :  NATO member states are now spending nearly a third more on defense
*06:09.340- 06:12.600* :  than they were before Russia invaded Crimea 10 years ago.
*06:13.320- 06:15.380* :  For now, the Magurti, for the International Institute
*06:15.380- 06:18.160* :  for Strategic Studies, is one of the report's authors.
*06:18.520- 06:22.160* :  A key finding from this year's military balance from the ISS
*06:22.160- 06:25.180* :  is that the deteriorating security landscape
*06:25.880- 06:28.380* :  has seen the increase in defense spending
*06:28.380- 06:31.120* :  driven to the highest record level of $2.2 trillion,
*06:32.080- 06:35.960* :  which is a 9% normal increase over spending levels last year.
*06:36.300- 06:39.240* :  Russia's losses in Ukraine have been staggeringly high,
*06:39.700- 06:41.520* :  around 3000 tanks so far.
*06:42.140- 06:44.360* :  That's as many as it started the full-scale invasion
*06:44.360- 06:45.400* :  with two years ago.
*06:46.000- 06:48.180* :  It's trying to replace them as fast as possible,
*06:48.660- 06:50.520* :  putting its factories onto a wall footing
*06:51.020- 06:52.740* :  and going for quantity over quality.
*06:53.380- 06:56.860* :  Ukraine, on the other hand, is tending to replace its battlefield losses
*06:57.340- 06:59.320* :  with more modern Western supplied equipment.
*07:00.100- 07:03.380* :  Ukraine is suffering from serious shortages of troops in ammunition,
*07:04.040- 07:04.880* :  but the report says,
*07:05.220- 07:07.120* :  Kiev demonstrates its ingenuity
*07:07.580- 07:10.220* :  by striking Russian targets beyond the front lines,
*07:10.760- 07:12.980* :  and by developing its own home-grown systems
*07:12.980- 07:15.380* :  to keep Russia's Black Sea fleet at bay.
*07:15.860- 07:16.480* :  Frank Gardner.
*07:17.140- 07:19.980* :  To the Middle East now, and as the conflict in Gaza continues,
*07:20.160- 07:23.000* :  discussions are underway on a framework for a temporary
*07:23.000- 07:25.100* :  truce between Israel and Hamas.
*07:25.520- 07:28.740* :  Negotiating teams from the US, Israel, Egypt, and Qatar
*07:29.320- 07:30.780* :  have begun talks in Cairo,
*07:31.040- 07:34.080* :  and Qatar's former director of defense intelligence operations
*07:34.080- 07:38.120* :  now of al-Tani, says he's optimistic about a possible deal.
*07:38.740- 07:41.040* :  There is a good chance of success.
*07:41.040- 07:43.300* :  Unfortunately, we've said this in the past.
*07:43.620- 07:45.900* :  Negotiations have broken down the past.
*07:46.720- 07:48.140* :  There have been adjustments made.
*07:48.140- 07:52.760* :  The Israeli Prime Minister has put some roadblocks
*07:52.820- 07:54.060* :  along the way, unfortunately,
*07:54.520- 07:55.580* :  but in the Biden administration,
*07:56.060- 07:58.400* :  I think pressed the Prime Minister of Israel
*07:58.860- 08:02.260* :  to go for the possible, rather than the perfect.
*08:02.680- 08:04.860* :  The need for a ceasefire is particularly acute
*08:04.860- 08:08.200* :  for the more than a million people who fled to Raffa
*08:08.560- 08:11.100* :  and the southernmost part of the Gaza Strip.
*08:11.500- 08:13.120* :  Israel has bombarded the city
*08:13.120- 08:16.120* :  and a full Israeli ground offensive may soon follow.
*08:16.580- 08:18.200* :  The BBC's Nick Beak in Jerusalem
*08:18.200- 08:21.300* :  told me more about how these latest ceasefire talks were going.
*08:21.660- 08:23.500* :  Well, Nick, according to President Biden,
*08:23.700- 08:25.920* :  the key elements of a deal are on the table,
*08:25.920- 08:28.680* :  but, according to him, gaps remain.
*08:28.680- 08:31.680* :  We're not going to see anything imminently.
*08:32.220- 08:34.920* :  The Americans have been quite optimistic
*08:34.960- 08:37.100* :  in their language over the past week or so,
*08:37.820- 08:39.700* :  saying that there is the potential
*08:39.700- 08:41.980* :  for the differences to be bridged
*08:41.980- 08:43.820* :  between Hamas and Israel.
*08:44.440- 08:46.480* :  Let's assume there were to be progressed.
*08:46.480- 08:47.480* :  What would it look like?
*08:47.660- 08:48.960* :  Well, there was this framework,
*08:48.960- 08:52.700* :  which was hammered out in Paris a couple of weekends ago.
*08:53.300- 08:55.320* :  And in that, there would be potentially
*08:55.320- 08:57.480* :  a lull in the fighting of, say, six weeks
*08:58.000- 09:00.160* :  during which time the remaining hostages
*09:00.160- 09:02.380* :  taken by Hamas on October 7th
*09:02.380- 09:04.620* :  would be released at the same time
*09:04.620- 09:08.620* :  as Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails being freed.
*09:09.200- 09:11.300* :  And also, there would be this pause in the fighting
*09:11.300- 09:13.400* :  so more humanitarian aid could get in.
*09:13.720- 09:15.500* :  But the thing is Benjamin Netanyahu,
*09:15.500- 09:16.640* :  the Israeli Prime Minister,
*09:16.640- 09:18.140* :  has said that Hamas's demands
*09:18.140- 09:21.380* :  that they put on top of this framework were delusional.
*09:21.380- 09:24.380* :  So that sort of language meant that a lot of people
*09:24.380- 09:26.160* :  were not really filled with much hope.
*09:26.360- 09:27.580* :  Clearly, a lot of people in Gaza
*09:27.980- 09:28.980* :  aren't filled with hope either,
*09:28.980- 09:30.700* :  because people who have moved many times
*09:30.700- 09:33.220* :  over the last few months are now moving again.
*09:33.660- 09:35.360* :  Where are they going and what are they going to find
*09:35.360- 09:35.960* :  when they get there?
*09:36.460- 09:37.840* :  Well, they don't know where they're going
*09:37.840- 09:41.220* :  and a pretty bleak picture will be wherever they end up,
*09:41.220- 09:42.700* :  really, there was one woman today
*09:42.700- 09:45.940* :  who was saying she was leaving with her family
*09:45.940- 09:48.300* :  and they weren't sure where they would go.
*09:48.300- 09:50.360* :  And this is the point that the United Nations
*09:50.960- 09:52.840* :  and multiple aid agencies are making
*09:52.840- 09:55.820* :  that they say no place is safe in Gaza.
*09:56.260- 09:58.320* :  So many different places that have been hit
*09:58.320- 09:59.140* :  by the fighting.
*09:59.180- 10:02.080* :  And this is why the United States, the UK,
*10:02.080- 10:04.460* :  allies of Israel are saying really,
*10:04.460- 10:06.400* :  they should think twice before they embark
*10:06.400- 10:08.300* :  on any sort of massive operation
*10:08.300- 10:11.900* :  to move 1.5 million people out of Rafa
*10:11.900- 10:15.360* :  so that their promised military campaign can begin there.
*10:15.800- 10:16.880* :  Nick Beak in Jerusalem.
*10:17.960- 10:20.180* :  To the Democratic Republic of Congo now,
*10:20.180- 10:22.760* :  where escalating violence has forced more people
*10:22.760- 10:26.840* :  to flee to a city that may soon be under siege itself,
*10:27.600- 10:29.820* :  rebels from the M23 group are advancing
*10:29.820- 10:31.240* :  on the eastern city of Goma
*10:31.240- 10:33.880* :  and have been attacking nearby towns and villages.
*10:34.500- 10:36.900* :  They're also blocking two main roads into Goma
*10:37.240- 10:40.100* :  and have cut it off from the farms that feed its inhabitants.
*10:40.660- 10:42.480* :  The BBC's Miley Jones has more.
*10:42.900- 10:45.880* :  In an unusual move, the DRC's Defense Minister,
*10:45.880- 10:48.500* :  Jean-Pierre Bemba, is visiting Eastern DRC
*10:48.500- 10:50.260* :  for the second time in less than a week.
*10:50.840- 10:52.100* :  He assured the local population
*10:52.100- 10:54.640* :  that the government is working closely with Manusco,
*10:55.100- 10:56.420* :  the UN's peacekeeping mission.
*10:56.840- 10:58.460* :  At the time of escalating tensions
*10:58.460- 10:59.880* :  in the Central African country.
*11:00.580- 11:02.560* :  Protesters have attacked Western embassies
*11:02.560- 11:04.660* :  and the Manusco office in the capital Kinshasa,
*11:05.200- 11:06.520* :  accusing the international community
*11:06.520- 11:08.980* :  of ignoring the conflict in eastern DRC
*11:09.440- 11:10.640* :  and of supporting Rwanda,
*11:10.920- 11:12.220* :  which has been accused by the UN
*11:12.220- 11:14.100* :  of backing the M23 rebels.
*11:15.040- 11:16.480* :  On Monday, there was a bomb explosion
*11:16.480- 11:17.880* :  at a camp for displaced people
*11:17.880- 11:20.200* :  in the town of Sake in eastern DRC.
*11:20.740- 11:22.500* :  The town has been repeatedly targeted
*11:22.500- 11:24.280* :  by M23 in the past week,
*11:24.820- 11:25.840* :  forcing thousands of people
*11:25.840- 11:27.900* :  to flee 25 kilometres south east
*11:27.900- 11:29.480* :  towards the major city of Goma.
*11:30.080- 11:32.160* :  Humanitarian agencies have expressed alarm
*11:32.160- 11:33.280* :  at the uptick in fighting
*11:33.280- 11:34.820* :  between government-allowed forces
*11:35.000- 11:36.680* :  and M23 in recent months.
*11:37.220- 11:39.600* :  1.1 million people are currently displaced
*11:39.600- 11:41.760* :  in the North-Kevil province by the conflict.
*11:42.480- 11:44.480* :  Rwanda has the normally supporting M23,
*11:45.140- 11:46.740* :  which says it's protecting the minority
*11:46.740- 11:48.760* :  tootsie population in eastern DRC
*11:48.760- 11:51.260* :  from discrimination by government-aligned forces.
*11:52.140- 11:53.020* :  Mione Jones.
*11:53.800- 11:56.000* :  Now, another start warning about the impact
*11:56.000- 11:57.120* :  of climate change.
*11:57.540- 12:00.240* :  Polar bears face a growing risk of starvation
*12:00.240- 12:01.980* :  as the ice melts in the Arctic
*12:02.520- 12:05.420* :  because they can't adapt their diets to living on land.
*12:05.880- 12:07.940* :  And that is the finding of a study by researchers
*12:07.940- 12:09.800* :  from Washington State University
*12:10.320- 12:12.200* :  and the US Geological Survey.
*12:12.500- 12:14.620* :  The team monitored dozens of bears in Canada
*12:14.620- 12:18.060* :  for several weeks each year from 2019 to 2022.
*12:18.700- 12:21.180* :  Our environment correspondent, Matt McGraw, has this report.
*12:22.900- 12:25.400* :  A polar bear splashes in the ice-free waters
*12:25.400- 12:28.460* :  of Hudson Bay in Canada, trying and failing
*12:28.460- 12:29.860* :  to eat a dead seal.
*12:30.440- 12:33.300* :  This bear was one of 20 studied with collar cameras
*12:33.820- 12:35.020* :  over a three-year period
*12:35.020- 12:38.140* :  to try to understand how the animals are responding
*12:38.140- 12:40.340* :  to increasingly ice-free summers.
*12:41.360- 12:43.100* :  Polar bears depend on the sea ice
*12:43.460- 12:45.320* :  as their platform to hunt seals
*12:45.860- 12:47.520* :  their main source of nourishment.
*12:48.340- 12:50.800* :  When the ice is gone, they have to spend more time on land.
*12:50.820- 12:53.680* :  Some forage for berries, eggs and grasses,
*12:54.300- 12:55.700* :  others conserve their energy
*12:56.100- 12:57.680* :  and wait for the ice to return.
*12:58.620- 13:00.920* :  Neither strategy works according to this study
*13:01.300- 13:03.980* :  with all but one of the bears losing up to 11%
*13:04.260- 13:06.460* :  of their body weight over the summer.
*13:07.040- 13:09.800* :  According to the lead author, Dr. Anthony Pagano
*13:09.800- 13:11.800* :  from the US Geological Survey,
*13:12.420- 13:14.180* :  the younger bears suffered more.
*13:14.580- 13:16.320* :  It's really the sub-adults, the younger bears
*13:16.440- 13:18.080* :  that seem to be at most risks.
*13:18.080- 13:20.080* :  They're not as skilled as hunters
*13:20.080- 13:21.420* :  and they also are smaller.
*13:21.420- 13:23.640* :  They're not able to accumulate as much by fat
*13:24.240- 13:25.860* :  and that puts them at much greater risk
*13:25.860- 13:28.740* :  of being able to endure this longer period on land.
*13:29.140- 13:31.820* :  The prospects for polar bear survival are complicated.
*13:32.500- 13:34.740* :  As in some regions, populations have grown
*13:35.220- 13:36.560* :  thanks to greater protection
*13:36.560- 13:38.660* :  and increased availability of prey.
*13:39.300- 13:41.800* :  However, this study shows that adaptation
*13:41.800- 13:44.100* :  is not a strong suit for these animals
*13:44.800- 13:47.640* :  and in a warmer world that may mean starvation
*13:48.240- 13:49.520* :  is a never-present threat.
*13:50.080- 13:50.560* :  Matt McGraw.
*13:53.460- 13:55.460* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast.
*13:55.960- 13:57.360* :  If you do find eggs for own period eggs,
*13:57.360- 13:59.480* :  it's usually a thick shell, but not as a whole egg.
*13:59.620- 14:01.220* :  And so that itself is amazing
*14:01.220- 14:02.560* :  that we mentioned to recover this egg.
*14:03.080- 14:05.260* :  And could that egg that goes back to the Romans
*14:05.660- 14:08.280* :  be the oldest of its kind ever to be discovered?
*14:16.260- 14:18.940* :  As you heard in our earlier Global News Podcast,
*14:18.940- 14:21.500* :  police in Northern India had to fire tear gas
*14:21.500- 14:24.200* :  to stop thousands of agricultural workers
*14:24.200- 14:25.480* :  from marching to Delhi.
*14:26.000- 14:28.540* :  The farmers want the government to guarantee the price
*14:28.600- 14:29.820* :  they get for their produce.
*14:30.320- 14:32.300* :  Police set up spikes and barricades
*14:32.300- 14:34.020* :  on roads leading to the capital.
*14:34.400- 14:37.340* :  The protesters seemed in no mood to let that stop them.
*14:41.420- 14:43.440* :  The current situation is our youngsters
*14:43.460- 14:45.460* :  have removed a layer of barricades
*14:45.460- 14:46.900* :  that the police put in place
*14:47.260- 14:48.860* :  and we will remove the rest as well.
*14:51.260- 14:53.860* :  See how peacefully the farmers are marching
*14:54.220- 14:56.200* :  yet the police are dropping tear gas shells
*14:56.200- 14:58.100* :  from drones hovering in the sky.
*14:59.000- 15:01.820* :  Our South Asia regional editor, Ambrassane Tharajan,
*15:02.100- 15:03.340* :  was following Tuesday's events.
*15:03.820- 15:07.360* :  There were thousands of farmers trying to march towards Delhi,
*15:07.360- 15:09.160* :  but most of these incidents happened
*15:09.860- 15:12.020* :  far away from Delhi, like 200 kilometers,
*15:12.020- 15:14.900* :  100 kilometers, well beyond Delhi's borders.
*15:15.420- 15:18.020* :  They were all coming from the states of Punjab
*15:18.020- 15:21.740* :  and Haryana, which are very well known for agriculture.
*15:22.120- 15:24.620* :  And now the first date was a lot of tear gas,
*15:24.620- 15:28.240* :  some bat and charge, and then some people were injured.
*15:28.440- 15:30.740* :  So the farmers were taken by surprise
*15:31.140- 15:33.080* :  with the readiness of the security forces
*15:33.080- 15:35.200* :  and the government how they were handling it.
*15:35.780- 15:38.300* :  What we have to wait and see is about how
*15:38.300- 15:41.060* :  this is going to trigger more reaction from the farmers,
*15:41.160- 15:42.540* :  because they have been insisting
*15:42.540- 15:44.180* :  all they want is to go to Delhi
*15:44.820- 15:47.200* :  and hold a protest, peaceful protest,
*15:47.800- 15:50.520* :  and the road barricades were put up by the government.
*15:50.820- 15:52.260* :  Now from the government's point of view,
*15:52.260- 15:55.620* :  they will want to get this done and dusted pretty quickly.
*15:55.620- 15:58.560* :  The voting in the general election starts in two months time.
*15:59.060- 16:02.140* :  What will it take to prevent the farmers
*16:02.140- 16:03.740* :  from carrying on protesting?
*16:04.760- 16:07.300* :  What the farmers are pointing out is that two years ago,
*16:07.420- 16:09.060* :  when the previous protest ended,
*16:09.060- 16:10.760* :  the government made a lot of promises,
*16:11.420- 16:13.360* :  for example, the minimum support prices
*16:13.540- 16:14.740* :  for all the crops.
*16:15.080- 16:17.660* :  On the government side, what they are saying is that
*16:17.660- 16:19.180* :  we cannot do it in a hurry.
*16:19.680- 16:22.160* :  We have to discuss with all the stakeholders.
*16:22.540- 16:24.180* :  And given that, is there much sympathy
*16:24.180- 16:26.140* :  from other people across India,
*16:26.140- 16:28.480* :  because they might say, look, I don't get a guarantee price
*16:28.480- 16:30.820* :  for my service, why should the farmers?
*16:31.100- 16:33.040* :  But you have to look at the farming in India,
*16:33.040- 16:35.780* :  it is not simply a livelihood, it is a way of life.
*16:36.320- 16:38.940* :  What we are talking about is 60% of the population
*16:39.560- 16:41.980* :  involved in agriculture in some form or the other.
*16:42.520- 16:44.780* :  And most of them have five acres or less.
*16:45.020- 16:46.640* :  So if you're going to put them at competition
*16:46.640- 16:48.980* :  with some farmers in the US or in Australia,
*16:49.520- 16:51.440* :  where they do this industrial production,
*16:52.020- 16:52.700* :  there is no match.
*16:53.020- 16:55.700* :  That's why the government looks at the cost of production.
*16:56.320- 16:57.740* :  Now, what the farmers are arguing
*16:57.740- 16:59.740* :  is the production cost has gone up,
*17:00.200- 17:01.580* :  and the labor cost has gone up.
*17:01.600- 17:04.380* :  So that is why they want minimum support prices.
*17:04.380- 17:07.160* :  And they are also worried about private investment,
*17:07.160- 17:09.120* :  to be on par with international agriculture,
*17:09.600- 17:10.800* :  to make it more profitable,
*17:11.340- 17:13.460* :  whereas the farmers say, no, we need more help.
*17:13.760- 17:14.580* :  It is not subsidy.
*17:14.580- 17:16.720* :  You are supporting people, a community.
*17:17.340- 17:18.460* :  Amber, son, et a margin.
*17:19.600- 17:21.060* :  Since Russia invaded Ukraine,
*17:21.060- 17:23.560* :  an increasing number of videos have appeared online,
*17:23.560- 17:27.020* :  where Russians apologize for various alleged offences
*17:27.480- 17:30.220* :  that contradict the Kremlin's dominant ideology.
*17:30.760- 17:33.540* :  Now, it started happening in occupied parts of Ukraine,
*17:33.540- 17:36.340* :  where some residents have been forced to record
*17:36.340- 17:39.640* :  apology clips after expressing pro-Ukrainian views.
*17:40.260- 17:41.920* :  Vitaly Shchevchenko has been investigating.
*17:42.860- 17:45.520* :  MUSIC
*17:48.000- 17:49.340* :  At the very end of last year,
*17:49.340- 17:52.900* :  a private party was held at a nightclub in Moscow,
*17:53.380- 17:55.880* :  where guests, some of them big pop stars,
*17:55.880- 17:58.240* :  were told to appear almost naked.
*17:58.840- 18:00.840* :  In the current climate of the war in Ukraine,
*18:00.860- 18:03.160* :  they were condemned as unpatriotic,
*18:03.160- 18:07.200* :  and soon enough, they started issuing videos full of remorse.
*18:07.500- 18:13.840* :  If so, I would like to ask the second chance.
*18:13.880- 18:17.040* :  Such clips are part of a culture of apology videos,
*18:17.480- 18:21.320* :  which have increased a number since the invasion almost two years ago.
*18:21.800- 18:25.200* :  Now, this practice has spread to occupied parts of Ukraine.
*18:25.200- 18:28.640* :  In the Netsk, one woman was forced to record an apology video
*18:28.920- 18:33.080* :  after posting pro-Ukrainian views and Ukrainian songs online.
*18:33.080- 18:35.860* :  To protect her identity, we'll call Hennina,
*18:36.180- 18:37.020* :  which isn't her real name,
*18:37.340- 18:40.000* :  and her words are spoken for her by someone else.
*18:40.320- 18:42.540* :  This is how she describes a visit to her home
*18:42.540- 18:45.480* :  by local Russia-backed security officers.
*18:45.960- 18:46.540* :  They said,
*18:46.720- 18:50.020* :  well, look, we can be rude and we can be cruel to you.
*18:50.240- 18:52.160* :  We can bundle you up in the boot now
*18:52.160- 18:54.300* :  and take you wherever we want.
*18:54.760- 18:56.440* :  There is no reason to be nice to you now.
*18:56.720- 18:59.320* :  After being interrogated and threatened by the police,
*18:59.780- 19:02.580* :  Nina was handed a piece of paper with her apology,
*19:02.880- 19:04.140* :  she was supposed to read.
*19:04.340- 19:05.800* :  The text was just atrocious.
*19:05.800- 19:08.280* :  It was the exact opposite of what I thought.
*19:09.040- 19:10.440* :  It was designed to break me.
*19:10.960- 19:13.120* :  They wanted me to say that I support Russia,
*19:13.560- 19:15.600* :  that the Netsk would flourish as part of Russia,
*19:15.940- 19:19.040* :  that Ukrainian troops are criminals, fascists, and so on.
*19:19.040- 19:23.520* :  The final straw was when the security officers threatened to send Nina to jail
*19:23.820- 19:25.620* :  and her child to an orphanage.
*19:25.860- 19:27.120* :  That's when I started crying.
*19:27.640- 19:29.640* :  Different thoughts were swirling in my head.
*19:30.020- 19:32.000* :  Was this just a police intimidation tactic
*19:32.000- 19:35.480* :  and they want to actually do it or did they mean it?
*19:35.900- 19:37.540* :  It was certainly within their power.
*19:37.800- 19:40.020* :  In the end, Nina recorded the apology video
*19:40.020- 19:40.900* :  the police wanted.
*19:41.420- 19:43.920* :  The experience left her devastated.
*19:44.380- 19:45.840* :  I felt my soul being raped.
*19:45.840- 19:49.160* :  They were trying to break disgrace and humiliate me.
*19:49.520- 19:51.300* :  Worst of all, I felt defeated.
*19:51.760- 19:52.780* :  So why is this happening?
*19:52.780- 19:55.860* :  Russian social anthropologist, Aleksandr Arhipova,
*19:56.120- 19:59.680* :  describes the videos as rituals of guilt and shame
*19:59.680- 20:02.520* :  that amount to extrajudicial punishment.
*20:03.700- 20:05.800* :  This violates internal freedom.
*20:06.580- 20:07.780* :  This has become the norm.
*20:08.520- 20:09.900* :  This is very bad.
*20:10.800- 20:12.200* :  If someone does something wrong,
*20:12.460- 20:14.280* :  the first thing they're supposed to do
*20:14.280- 20:16.020* :  is record an apology video.
*20:16.280- 20:20.160* :  Mr Arhipova believes that the videos are a product of a president
*20:20.160- 20:23.360* :  who treats Russia like an overbearing father.
*20:24.780- 20:26.660* :  Everyone else is like children
*20:26.660- 20:28.860* :  who have no legal agency of their own.
*20:29.380- 20:30.660* :  The father is always right.
*20:30.660- 20:33.880* :  So if they do anything wrong, what do they have to do?
*20:33.980- 20:36.120* :  They have to apologize to their father.
*20:36.380- 20:38.580* :  Ms Arhipova, too, has come under pressure
*20:38.580- 20:39.720* :  from the Russian authorities
*20:40.080- 20:42.480* :  who have designated her as a foreign agent.
*20:43.220- 20:47.260* :  Vitaly Shevchenko, how do you like your eggs in the morning?
*20:47.260- 20:49.740* :  Well, probably a bit fresher than this one.
*20:50.220- 20:53.120* :  After on Earthing, it during an archaeological dig
*20:53.120- 20:55.920* :  over a decade ago, UK scientists have discovered
*20:55.920- 21:00.300* :  that a 1,700-year-old egg still contains liquid.
*21:00.820- 21:03.180* :  The revelation makes it the only intact egg
*21:03.180- 21:06.560* :  from Roman Britain and the oldest egg ever discovered
*21:06.560- 21:08.540* :  that wasn't deliberately preserved.
*21:09.020- 21:11.620* :  Edward Bidolf from Oxford Archaeology
*21:12.000- 21:13.640* :  led the excavation in southern England.
*21:13.640- 21:17.300* :  Tim Franks asked him about the significance of this discovery.
*21:17.840- 21:20.360* :  The egg was actually excavated a while ago in 2010,
*21:20.600- 21:23.180* :  as part of an excavation on a housing development.
*21:23.180- 21:25.720* :  And the egg was found in a waterlogged pit.
*21:25.960- 21:27.520* :  And when conditions are right,
*21:27.520- 21:29.540* :  then organic objects which don't normally survive
*21:29.540- 21:32.660* :  can survive, like wooden objects and leather and things like that.
*21:33.020- 21:36.020* :  And the site was part of a Roman town, just outside Ale's base.
*21:36.080- 21:38.060* :  It was reasonably large size town.
*21:38.060- 21:39.980* :  And this waterlogged pit, which had been used
*21:39.980- 21:41.400* :  to extract water from the morning of brewing,
*21:41.540- 21:43.220* :  it's still very wet when we excavate it.
*21:43.440- 21:44.700* :  And it seems that the Roman people had,
*21:44.800- 21:46.640* :  after the pit had been used from the morning of brewing,
*21:46.920- 21:49.120* :  used it to throw in coins and other objects
*21:49.120- 21:50.000* :  as offerings to the gods.
*21:50.360- 21:53.080* :  And it included these eggs, though two other egg with this one.
*21:53.280- 21:55.600* :  42 disintegrated on exposure to the air,
*21:55.600- 21:57.080* :  but we managed to recover one.
*21:57.520- 21:59.040* :  So normally, these things don't survive.
*21:59.160- 22:00.120* :  I mean, if you do find eggs,
*22:00.120- 22:01.600* :  they're in period eggs, it's usually a seg shell,
*22:01.600- 22:02.940* :  but not as a whole egg.
*22:03.080- 22:04.660* :  And so that itself is amazing
*22:04.660- 22:05.980* :  that we managed to recover this egg.
*22:06.200- 22:07.520* :  Now, several years down the line,
*22:07.520- 22:09.460* :  we did all the post-exhibition analysis
*22:09.460- 22:10.640* :  and published the results.
*22:10.660- 22:14.100* :  But we had to think about the long term storage of this egg.
*22:14.340- 22:16.420* :  And this is where the conservator we worked with,
*22:16.620- 22:19.180* :  Dana Goodburn Brown, she did a micro CT scan of the egg,
*22:19.180- 22:20.960* :  because we had to know quite what we were dealing with.
*22:21.300- 22:24.200* :  The scan just showed it's contained a liquid.
*22:24.480- 22:27.020* :  So what you're going to presumably introduce
*22:27.020- 22:30.920* :  an extremely narrow needle in a syringe
*22:30.920- 22:33.000* :  in a very controlled environment
*22:33.000- 22:34.680* :  to ensure that it doesn't shatter?
*22:35.020- 22:36.440* :  Yes, we're still making arrangements
*22:36.440- 22:38.100* :  to look into the possibility of doing this
*22:38.100- 22:40.940* :  and a very fine hole can be made into the egg
*22:40.940- 22:42.360* :  and the liquid extracted.
*22:43.000- 22:45.360* :  But how do you idea what bird it might be?
*22:45.360- 22:46.520* :  Have you got any theories?
*22:46.520- 22:48.340* :  Well, we think it's a chicken's egg
*22:48.340- 22:49.140* :  that hasn't been confirmed,
*22:49.160- 22:51.540* :  because chickens are actually quite important in the room world
*22:51.540- 22:52.940* :  and, apart from just being a food source,
*22:52.940- 22:54.760* :  it they were used for sacrifice
*22:54.760- 22:56.860* :  or for ritual feasts and things like that.
*22:56.920- 22:58.900* :  And so it makes sense for it to be chicken's egg
*22:58.900- 23:01.120* :  and of a superficial examination of the egg
*23:01.220- 23:02.400* :  to suggest that it may well be.
*23:02.600- 23:04.140* :  And when the other two eggs with it
*23:04.340- 23:05.840* :  are sort of shattered on exposure to it,
*23:05.840- 23:07.820* :  they did emit a eggy smell.
*23:07.820- 23:10.060* :  We think that the contents still have something
*23:10.060- 23:11.220* :  of the original content.
*23:11.400- 23:13.540* :  Absolutely, nobody really has the chance
*23:13.540- 23:15.320* :  to deal with something that's quite old
*23:15.320- 23:17.340* :  and still in this level of preservation.
*23:17.440- 23:19.800* :  So actually, there's a story that continues
*23:19.800- 23:22.200* :  to run as we find more and more out about the egg.
*23:22.440- 23:24.160* :  I mean, of course, there are older preserved eggs,
*23:24.360- 23:25.480* :  perhaps in Egypt, for instance,
*23:25.480- 23:28.280* :  mummified eggs, but this wasn't intended to be preserved.
*23:28.540- 23:30.020* :  Is it putting it too strongly, Edward,
*23:30.020- 23:33.340* :  to say that archaeologists are going to sort of have to
*23:34.000- 23:35.960* :  rethink how they excavate?
*23:36.060- 23:37.560* :  Because obviously, if you've just gone in
*23:37.560- 23:39.960* :  with your normal excavating tools,
*23:39.960- 23:41.500* :  it may not have survived.
*23:41.880- 23:43.400* :  Of course, we do have a range of methods
*23:43.400- 23:45.060* :  to deal with all sorts of conditions
*23:45.460- 23:47.540* :  and it's not all with a massive digger
*23:47.540- 23:49.140* :  and big tools to excavate,
*23:49.140- 23:51.580* :  but it does make you aware of what could survive.
*23:51.900- 23:52.940* :  It is a reminder, really,
*23:52.940- 23:55.200* :  that we have to prepare for anything, really.
*23:55.700- 23:57.940* :  Edward Biddalf, speaking to Tim Franks.
*23:59.000- 24:01.940* :  The power and politics of textiles in art
*24:01.940- 24:03.720* :  is being explored in a new exhibition
*24:03.720- 24:05.700* :  at the Barbican Centre here in London.
*24:06.080- 24:08.100* :  It's about fabric used through the ages
*24:08.100- 24:10.260* :  to tell stories that transgress boundaries
*24:10.620- 24:12.320* :  and challenge power structures.
*24:12.940- 24:15.620* :  Julia Bryan Wilson, author of Frey Art
*24:15.620- 24:18.980* :  and textile politics, has advised on the exhibition
*24:18.980- 24:21.860* :  and L.J. Roberts is an artist whose work is in it.
*24:22.220- 24:24.480* :  Michelle Hussain, started by asking Julia
*24:24.480- 24:26.320* :  for a few examples of how fabric
*24:26.320- 24:28.080* :  has challenged power politics.
*24:28.640- 24:29.960* :  Sure, I'll give a couple of examples.
*24:30.200- 24:32.720* :  Of course, we live our lives awash in textiles
*24:32.880- 24:34.600* :  and they are absolutely integral
*24:34.600- 24:38.200* :  to how we code ourselves as we dress every single day.
*24:38.720- 24:40.320* :  We are wrapped in textiles from the moment
*24:40.320- 24:41.760* :  that we are born until we die
*24:41.760- 24:44.600* :  and so they are just charged with all kinds of issues
*24:44.840- 24:47.860* :  around gender, class, around colonization,
*24:47.980- 24:50.500* :  the movement of bodies, signification
*24:50.500- 24:52.680* :  of subcultural status, et cetera.
*24:52.860- 24:55.460* :  And fabric is often used by artists and activists
*24:55.460- 24:58.700* :  as a way to push back against kind of codes of normativity.
*24:59.040- 25:01.380* :  One example might be from this island,
*25:02.080- 25:03.360* :  which is the suffragette banners
*25:03.360- 25:05.780* :  that were stitched and held aloft by women
*25:05.780- 25:09.260* :  seeking to advocate the power for women's rights to vote.
*25:09.820- 25:13.520* :  Utilizing fabric to make powerful statements
*25:13.520- 25:15.660* :  in public that would be legible
*25:15.960- 25:18.460* :  and also really importantly turning to the needle
*25:18.760- 25:20.260* :  and thread, which has often been coded
*25:20.260- 25:23.540* :  as a kind of domestic or pacifying activity
*25:23.540- 25:25.420* :  but using it against itself.
*25:25.520- 25:25.760* :  Yes.
*25:25.980- 25:28.540* :  I'm also reminded of Gandhi challenging the British Empire
*25:28.540- 25:31.100* :  campaigning on cloth, making the point
*25:31.100- 25:33.880* :  that British imports of cloth had affected the Indian economy.
*25:34.240- 25:34.660* :  100%.
*25:34.840- 25:37.000* :  And Gandhi, of course, the very iconic photograph
*25:37.000- 25:38.060* :  by Margaret Brook White
*25:38.060- 25:39.260* :  in front of the spinning wheel,
*25:39.260- 25:42.580* :  someone who is really pushed back against the idea
*25:42.580- 25:45.700* :  that textile fabrication was being consolidated
*25:45.700- 25:48.140* :  by the British Empire and really hoping
*25:48.140- 25:51.460* :  for generating more local economies precisely around fabric.
*25:51.720- 25:53.920* :  LJ, your work is in the exhibition.
*25:54.360- 25:55.040* :  What is that work?
*25:55.040- 25:56.000* :  Can you describe it?
*25:56.500- 25:59.780* :  Yeah, the work is three portraits that were taken
*26:00.180- 26:02.120* :  from series called Carey With Me
*26:02.120- 26:03.740* :  that I began in 2011.
*26:04.520- 26:06.440* :  I make these very small portraits.
*26:06.440- 26:08.520* :  They're about four by six inches
*26:08.520- 26:10.260* :  so part in the American measurements
*26:10.940- 26:13.680* :  of friends and collaborators and loved ones
*26:13.780- 26:16.120* :  in my extended queer community.
*26:16.820- 26:19.680* :  They're all hand stitched with a single thread
*26:20.340- 26:23.080* :  and I work on them in the subway.
*26:23.080- 26:25.040* :  Is it like an embroidered portrait?
*26:25.160- 26:26.360* :  They're embroidered portraits
*26:26.360- 26:29.940* :  and they're shown in a way where they're suspended in glass.
*26:30.780- 26:32.520* :  So it's figurative on one side.
*26:32.640- 26:35.340* :  So you see the person sort of posed
*26:35.380- 26:36.500* :  in a traditional portrait.
*26:36.500- 26:38.520* :  There's lots of kind of queer signifiers,
*26:38.520- 26:40.940* :  either sometimes they're at protests
*26:40.940- 26:43.440* :  or at home or with each other at parties.
*26:44.120- 26:46.840* :  But then you can also see the back of the portrait
*26:47.160- 26:50.500* :  and those threads are very tangled.
*26:50.740- 26:51.880* :  They're a little chaotic.
*26:51.880- 26:53.200* :  They're beautiful.
*26:53.200- 26:55.840* :  And to me, they're almost more indicative
*26:56.400- 26:59.140* :  of a human experience than the body is.
*26:59.660- 27:01.480* :  I'm thinking that over the ages
*27:01.700- 27:02.660* :  and perhaps even now,
*27:02.960- 27:04.900* :  do you struggle that sometimes people perceive it
*27:04.900- 27:06.300* :  as craft rather than art?
*27:06.640- 27:08.860* :  I like to embrace the word craft personally
*27:08.860- 27:13.800* :  and that's been something that has been a regular
*27:14.400- 27:17.680* :  to use the textile metaphor thread in my work.
*27:18.140- 27:20.640* :  There's a lot of controversy about the word craft
*27:20.640- 27:22.400* :  but for me, craft is something
*27:23.140- 27:26.160* :  where it is constantly challenging the center
*27:26.620- 27:29.560* :  but for me, it's much more productive to be on the margins
*27:29.560- 27:33.080* :  than constantly reinventing those margins.
*27:33.960- 27:35.920* :  And Julia has written really beautifully
*27:35.960- 27:38.060* :  about craft over the years, too.
*27:38.300- 27:40.460* :  So that work that she's done
*27:40.460- 27:42.220* :  has been incredibly informative.
*27:43.280- 27:45.620* :  L.J. Roberts and Julia Bryan Wilson
*27:45.620- 27:47.080* :  speaking to Michelle Hussain.
*27:48.180- 27:49.820* :  The British singer, Zayn Malik,
*27:49.820- 27:52.060* :  has propelled the Pakistani group
*27:52.060- 27:54.400* :  or into the global spotlight
*27:54.400- 27:57.380* :  by collaborating on their track to high command.
*27:57.880- 27:59.280* :  It means where have you gone?
*27:59.280- 28:01.940* :  In Urdu and is already a huge hit
*28:01.940- 28:03.200* :  in their native Pakistan.
*28:03.720- 28:05.260* :  Zayn Malik, who used to be a member
*28:05.260- 28:08.360* :  of the British chart-topping band One Direction,
*28:08.360- 28:11.380* :  was born in England and his dad is from Pakistan.
*28:11.380- 28:14.580* :  He's surprised many fans with his fluent Urdu singing.
*28:15.160- 28:17.820* :  The band, or spoke to our culture correspondent
*28:17.820- 28:20.200* :  Nour Nanji about their viral hit.
*28:27.120- 28:29.340* :  To her Khan was already a massive hit
*28:29.340- 28:30.760* :  in Pakistan and India.
*28:31.800- 28:35.020* :  But then Zayn Malik jumped on board singing in Urdu.
*28:42.920- 28:45.600* :  Suddenly, a whole new audience discovered the song.
*28:47.340- 28:49.600* :  I asked the three artists he teamed up with
*28:50.040- 28:52.360* :  in my Rusty Urdu, how they're doing.
*28:56.780- 28:58.400* :  They mostly answered in Urdu,
*28:58.760- 29:00.720* :  but with the odd English word thrown in.
*29:03.840- 29:04.760* :  It feels so good.
*29:04.940- 29:06.980* :  I mean, some people have this dream that we have achieved.
*29:07.140- 29:10.800* :  That was a hard car, and here's his bandmate, Rafi Anwar.
*29:14.060- 29:15.900* :  Previously, we just said Pakistani audience.
*29:15.980- 29:18.800* :  Now we have people from the UK, Brazil, China.
*29:18.800- 29:21.060* :  So it feels very good, very nice.
*29:23.980- 29:25.680* :  So you're known around the world now.
*29:26.040- 29:28.120* :  What has been the reaction at home from your friends
*29:28.120- 29:30.920* :  and your family? Crazy reaction. Crazy reaction.
*29:32.920- 29:33.800* :  No one was believing it.
*29:33.800- 29:35.400* :  That was a hard and Rafi again,
*29:35.400- 29:38.440* :  and here's another member of the band, Osama Ali.
*29:40.340- 29:42.520* :  The reaction has been very good, not just friends.
*29:42.640- 29:45.140* :  The whole of Pakistan has given us a great reaction.
*29:48.040- 29:49.960* :  Zain Malik is better known for pop songs,
*29:49.960- 29:52.400* :  like What Makes You Beautiful and Pillow Talk.
*29:55.320- 29:57.860* :  But his fans were thrilled that the Bradford-born singer
*29:57.860- 29:59.520* :  is also fluent in Urdu.
*30:07.520- 30:09.420* :  The original version of Two-Hair Khan
*30:09.420- 30:11.840* :  gained more than 100 million views on YouTube.
*30:12.520- 30:14.180* :  But the remake is catching up fast
*30:14.180- 30:15.740* :  with more than 8 million views.
*30:16.940- 30:19.320* :  Or, say, Zain was a delight to work with.
*30:23.100- 30:25.920* :  He sang in Urdu. What can be bigger than that?
*30:28.660- 30:30.440* :  Okay, so you've partnered with Zain Malik.
*30:30.780- 30:32.560* :  Which Western stars are next for you?
*30:32.620- 30:36.460* :  Western stars, yeah, I got 21 seven.
*30:36.580- 30:40.120* :  Western stars, I guess, 21 Savage and Drake, the weekend.
*30:41.700- 30:42.500* :  We will do it with anyone.
