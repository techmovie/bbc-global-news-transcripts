*01:55.020- 01:56.520* :  where he's serving a prison sentence.

*02:08.400- 02:11.500* :  Will Greece become the first majority orthodox country
*02:11.960- 02:13.140* :  to allow gay marriage?
*02:18.220- 02:19.660* :  As we record this podcast,
*02:19.700- 02:23.920* :  senior officials from the United States, Qatar, and Egypt
*02:23.920- 02:27.740* :  are meeting in Cairo to discuss a possible cease-fire in Gaza.
*02:28.340- 02:30.860* :  The head of the Israeli spy agency Mossad
*02:31.260- 02:33.480* :  is also reported to be attending the talks.
*02:34.220- 02:37.320* :  They take place against warnings of a potential bloodbath
*02:37.700- 02:40.340* :  if the Israelis insist on launching a ground attack
*02:40.340- 02:42.840* :  in the southern Gaza City of Raffa.
*02:43.480- 02:45.320* :  More than half of Gaza's population,
*02:45.380- 02:49.700* :  around 1.4 million people, are now crammed into Raffa
*02:50.100- 02:51.200* :  in appalling conditions.
*02:51.900- 02:54.640* :  The head of the UN's Relief Agency for Palestinians
*02:54.700- 02:56.440* :  is Philippe Lazarini.
*02:57.020- 02:59.240* :  He's warned that the thousands of displaced people
*02:59.240- 03:01.700* :  sheltering in Raffa have nowhere to go.
*03:02.580- 03:06.180* :  There is absolutely no safe place in Raffa anymore.
*03:06.860- 03:10.800* :  And the fear is that the number of people killed in India
*03:11.360- 03:13.460* :  might, again, significantly increase.
*03:14.460- 03:18.760* :  And we are still talking about the largest military offensive
*03:19.980- 03:23.180* :  in the middle of a scene of displaced people.
*03:23.900- 03:27.540* :  They are asked to move, the question is where to move.
*03:28.260- 03:30.660* :  A spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in London,
*03:30.660- 03:34.360* :  Oli Goldschmidt, insisted it was up to Hamas
*03:34.360- 03:36.760* :  to earn the suffering of the Palestinian people.
*03:37.480- 03:39.940* :  I can assure you that we don't want to hurt civilians.
*03:39.940- 03:42.800* :  We have never been at war with the Palestinian people.
*03:43.260- 03:44.980* :  Our only war is against Hamas.
*03:45.040- 03:46.540* :  And we will do everything we can
*03:46.920- 03:49.720* :  in order to minimize the numbers of civilian casualties
*03:49.720- 03:51.880* :  but you know there's a very simple equation here.
*03:52.300- 03:55.180* :  If Hamas cares about their own civilians,
*03:55.180- 03:57.220* :  they can just surrender today.
*03:57.600- 03:59.420* :  And then we won't need this ground invasion.
*04:00.420- 04:03.100* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Barbara Plattasha,
*04:03.480- 04:05.140* :  told me more about the latest talks.
*04:05.980- 04:08.920* :  These are the talks about the potential temporary pause
*04:08.920- 04:12.000* :  in the fighting, which has been on the table for a while.
*04:12.000- 04:13.960* :  A framework has been on the table drawn up
*04:13.960- 04:17.120* :  by the intelligence chiefs of the United States, Qatar,
*04:17.120- 04:19.760* :  and Egypt and approved by the Israelis.
*04:20.240- 04:22.700* :  The Israeli Prime Minister very strongly rejected
*04:22.700- 04:24.340* :  Hamas' terms last week.
*04:24.460- 04:27.660* :  But the Americans are very, very much pressing this right now
*04:27.660- 04:29.020* :  as our other international allies.
*04:29.020- 04:31.240* :  They are very much wanting to try to get at least
*04:31.240- 04:33.440* :  a six-week pause in order to release the rest
*04:33.440- 04:36.180* :  of the Israeli hostages and have a period of calm
*04:36.180- 04:38.580* :  where they can really surge aid into Gaza.
*04:38.580- 04:41.760* :  Now, despite Mr. Netanyahu's very strong comments last week,
*04:41.760- 04:44.080* :  he has sent a high-level delegation to Cairo
*04:44.220- 04:45.160* :  to continue the talks.
*04:45.220- 04:47.940* :  And Israeli media says that was because of U.S. pressure,
*04:47.940- 04:49.960* :  because Mr. Netanyahu's focus is trying
*04:49.960- 04:53.460* :  to expand the offensive into the Southern Gaza City of Rafa,
*04:53.680- 04:55.600* :  whereas the Americans and the others are just saying,
*04:55.600- 04:56.820* :  no, we need to have a pause.
*04:57.100- 04:59.700* :  We've heard from both Joe Biden and King Abdullah
*04:59.700- 05:01.560* :  following their meeting in Washington.
*05:02.200- 05:04.640* :  Are there comments likely to make any difference?
*05:04.960- 05:07.560* :  Well, I think it is pretty likely
*05:07.560- 05:11.240* :  that the Israelis will send ground troops into Rafa,
*05:11.260- 05:13.960* :  which is the last major population center in Gaza
*05:13.960- 05:16.800* :  that has not seen the Israeli campaign.
*05:16.800- 05:19.700* :  Their argument is that they need to go in
*05:19.700- 05:23.240* :  in order to defeat Hamas's last battalions as they put it.
*05:23.280- 05:24.800* :  They don't want to be in any position,
*05:24.800- 05:28.000* :  leave Hamas in any position to be able to reconstitute itself.
*05:28.100- 05:30.340* :  They seem to be quite insistent that they will do this.
*05:30.340- 05:32.660* :  However, they have met a lot of opposition,
*05:32.840- 05:34.660* :  so I don't think it's going to happen right away.
*05:34.660- 05:38.080* :  So from the UN, for example, Israel needs the UN
*05:38.080- 05:40.500* :  in order to organize an alternate location, I guess,
*05:40.500- 05:42.580* :  tent camps, really, for all the displaced people
*05:42.580- 05:43.460* :  sheltering in Rafa.
*05:43.520- 05:44.460* :  And the UN spokesman has said,
*05:44.460- 05:46.480* :  well, we're not going to be party to force displacement.
*05:46.480- 05:48.460* :  You can't send people back to areas
*05:48.940- 05:51.700* :  that don't have shelter, that have unexploded ordinance.
*05:51.700- 05:53.760* :  There isn't a safe place in Gaza right now.
*05:53.980- 05:56.220* :  So quite a bit of resistance from that quarter.
*05:56.380- 05:58.160* :  And then, as I was saying, from international allies
*05:58.160- 06:01.040* :  to warning about the humanitarian catastrophe in Mr. Biden,
*06:01.260- 06:03.260* :  very pointedly asking for a credible plan
*06:03.260- 06:05.820* :  to protect civilians, calling them exposed and vulnerable.
*06:06.200- 06:08.800* :  And just finally, considering the nature of Hamas
*06:08.800- 06:11.580* :  and how they operate, can they be absolutely sure
*06:11.580- 06:13.960* :  there is a certain number of battalions in one place
*06:14.660- 06:16.860* :  and getting rid of those will be the end of the matter.
*06:17.180- 06:19.700* :  What the Israelis say, they have numbers, you see.
*06:19.700- 06:21.600* :  They say that there are 24 battalions
*06:21.600- 06:23.920* :  that they have defeated 18, that they are still fighting
*06:23.920- 06:27.380* :  two in Hanyunistan, that the remaining four are in Rafa.
*06:27.640- 06:29.600* :  We have no way of independently verifying that.
*06:29.820- 06:31.920* :  And I think there would be an argument for saying
*06:31.920- 06:34.100* :  that Hamas is probably more fluid than that.
*06:34.260- 06:37.020* :  And there are constituencies within the Israeli establishment
*06:37.020- 06:39.860* :  who also question whether Hamas can really be defeated,
*06:39.860- 06:43.220* :  given that it's very dug in both physically in tunnels,
*06:43.220- 06:46.080* :  but also otherwise in Gaza doesn't necessarily operate
*06:46.080- 06:50.240* :  like an organized army and has social and political
*06:50.240- 06:51.500* :  and ideological support.
*06:51.500- 06:53.760* :  So even if you get rid of a lot of Hamas fighters,
*06:53.760- 06:55.680* :  there will be others who come to replace them,
*06:55.680- 06:58.400* :  especially given the ferocity of the Israeli campaign
*06:58.400- 06:59.120* :  against them.
*06:59.260- 07:03.160* :  When it comes to the Americans who do support Israel's war aims,
*07:03.160- 07:06.520* :  there is skepticism there too that Hamas can be totally defeated.
*07:06.520- 07:09.160* :  But what they would like to see is its military capabilities
*07:09.160- 07:12.080* :  degraded to the point that it would be unable to carry out
*07:12.080- 07:13.580* :  another tober 7th-like attack.
*07:14.140- 07:15.140* :  Barbara Pledge Usher.
*07:16.020- 07:18.340* :  Shortly after Warbroke out in the Middle East,
*07:18.620- 07:21.900* :  the BBC World Service began following an ambulance crew
*07:21.900- 07:25.540* :  from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Northern Gaza.
*07:26.100- 07:29.800* :  journalist Faraz Al Ayami, filmed with the paramedics,
*07:30.180- 07:32.940* :  witnessing them saving lives in areas hardest hit
*07:33.380- 07:34.640* :  by Israeli airstrikes.
*07:35.020- 07:38.420* :  Dalia Hadar, a BBC News Arabic, has sent this report.
*07:42.860- 07:43.960* :  Go straight to the ICU.
*07:44.060- 07:47.960* :  She has a wound on her thigh, six centimeters deep.
*07:48.780- 07:51.920* :  She's also has injuries on her hand and eyes.
*07:56.020- 07:59.400* :  Muhammad has been a volunteer with a Red Crescent for a decade.
*08:03.720- 08:06.340* :  This war is one of the toughest I have seen.
*08:07.400- 08:11.320* :  In the first three days, the number killed and the destruction
*08:11.460- 08:15.220* :  was equal to the previous four or five wars together.
*08:19.400- 08:22.840* :  Back at base, he's wiping down a bloodied stretcher
*08:23.620- 08:24.940* :  before the next call out.
*08:27.940- 08:29.580* :  We have seen too many horrors.
*08:30.340- 08:31.040* :  We are tired.
*08:32.000- 08:35.500* :  We all need help with our mental health for years.
*08:36.580- 08:40.600* :  All suffering we have seen, we want the war to end.
*08:41.520- 08:42.640* :  Enough destruction.
*08:43.420- 08:43.660* :  Enough.
*08:55.420- 09:00.220* :  The hardest day was when our colleagues were killed.
*09:00.860- 09:04.940* :  Basilitelli is one of the radio dispatchers for the Red Crescent.
*09:05.400- 09:08.760* :  It was October the 11th.
*09:09.740- 09:12.640* :  We received a call about a target in a Brazilian-Nedia area.
*09:13.160- 09:14.000* :  There were casualties.
*09:14.780- 09:16.820* :  Ambulance 515 headed there.
*09:16.820- 09:21.180* :  Officer Yusri Al-Masri, volunteer paramedic Ahmad Dahman,
*09:21.780- 09:25.200* :  and volunteer paramedic Khalil Sharif, all dead.
*09:35.620- 09:37.580* :  The missiles burn people's bodies.
*09:42.240- 09:48.600* :  The occupation is directly targeting civilians, children, women, girls, elderly people.
*09:50.400- 09:53.540* :  They destroy people's homes while they are inside,
*09:54.380- 09:56.940* :  without any remorse, without any humanity.
*09:58.220- 10:03.340* :  These rail defense forces said any claims that we intentionally target Red Crescent
*10:03.340- 10:06.520* :  or medical workers is baseless and untrue.
*10:07.280- 10:09.480* :  We act in accordance with international law
*10:09.840- 10:14.280* :  and take feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm in our operations.
*10:21.340- 10:28.260* :  The first thing that comes to mind when you hold the body of a dead child holding your own child.
*10:29.420- 10:33.880* :  On October 27th, Israel cut off all communications to Gaza.
*10:36.800- 10:42.420* :  There have been no emergency calls which puts civilian lives in grave danger
*10:44.000- 10:47.200* :  and hinders our ability to reach those in need.
*10:48.140- 10:52.500* :  Those in need of urgent treatment and those in need of love.
*10:54.600- 10:59.460* :  Rami can only communicate with his daughters in Rafa via the paramedic's radio.
*11:01.480- 11:02.820* :  We're safe, they say.
*11:03.560- 11:04.740* :  We miss you so much.
*11:07.700- 11:09.380* :  His younger daughter is here.
*11:13.440- 11:14.460* :  Tears on her cheeks.
*11:15.460- 11:16.200* :  I'm missing you.
*11:16.720- 11:17.600* :  Look after yourself.
*11:19.340- 11:20.580* :  Rami drops the handset,
*11:21.080- 11:22.800* :  cradles his head and cries.
*11:25.100- 11:28.420* :  A moment with his family far from home.
*11:33.160- 11:35.500* :  You can watch BBC Arabic's full film,
*11:35.500- 11:40.920* :  Gaza 101 Emergency Rescue on the World Service YouTube page.
*11:41.240- 11:45.200* :  Or if you're in the UK, it's on the BBC iPlayer.
*11:45.740- 11:46.780* :  Now to India.
*11:56.260- 11:58.760* :  The sounds of tear gas being fired by police,
*11:58.760- 12:01.540* :  targeting farmers heading to the capital, Delhi,
*12:01.980- 12:03.820* :  from neighbouring states to protest.
*12:04.580- 12:09.320* :  The farmers want the government to agree a guaranteed minimum price for the crops they grow.
*12:09.980- 12:12.340* :  The capital has been turned into a fortress,
*12:13.020- 12:14.820* :  with blockades and tight security,
*12:14.820- 12:18.280* :  to try and avoid the chaos that ensued in 2020,
*12:19.000- 12:21.420* :  when similar protests lasted more than a year,
*12:22.000- 12:25.340* :  and forced the government to eventually back down on proposed reforms.
*12:26.140- 12:29.280* :  Since then, talks have taken place, but broken down.
*12:29.920- 12:34.760* :  Sarvan Singh Pandur is the general secretary of the Punjab Farmers Union,
*12:34.760- 12:37.720* :  and he says the government have run out of time.
*12:42.160- 12:45.380* :  We thought that giving more time for the government was not suitable now.
*12:45.940- 12:49.200* :  If there's a strong proposal, then we can think you're giving them more time,
*12:49.860- 12:51.340* :  but they don't have anything to offer.
*12:55.680- 12:57.320* :  Well, it's pretty incredible, you know,
*12:57.360- 13:01.960* :  you're talking about farmers that are coming from three neighbouring states into Delhi,
*13:02.080- 13:06.180* :  and I'm in the city, and I just took a spin around the city a little bit,
*13:06.180- 13:13.020* :  and you can see several paramilitary forces and police forces out on the streets in central Delhi,
*13:13.480- 13:18.560* :  and they're just preparing for these protesters potentially breaching those barricades
*13:18.560- 13:19.500* :  and coming into the city.
*13:19.760- 13:24.080* :  But remember, those borders are still more than 100 kilometers away,
*13:24.080- 13:30.840* :  but that's just how prepared Delhi is for, in case these farmers are able to breach those
*13:30.840- 13:34.780* :  barriers. But remember, the barriers are actually concrete blockades.
*13:34.780- 13:37.600* :  There are metal barbed wire.
*13:37.600- 13:40.080* :  It's incredible fortress.
*13:40.080- 13:43.300* :  It's something that you would normally associate with an international border,
*13:43.720- 13:46.680* :  and not necessarily a state border in a country.
*13:47.060- 13:50.120* :  As we said, it's not the first time we've seen these sorts of protests.
*13:50.120- 13:52.160* :  What are the demands of the farmers this time?
*13:52.560- 13:58.080* :  This time, the farmers are looking for a basic minimum price set for their crops,
*13:58.300- 14:01.640* :  and from the farmers perspective, they say that this was something they'd demanded
*14:01.640- 14:05.420* :  at the last protest, or at least that was something that was promised to them at the last protest.
*14:05.420- 14:08.880* :  So they feel that the government hasn't really gone through on that.
*14:08.880- 14:14.360* :  They're also asking for more protections in terms of import export pricing,
*14:14.360- 14:18.960* :  and they really want India to actually withdraw from the world trade organization.
*14:19.600- 14:21.200* :  That's one of the big worries, right?
*14:21.200- 14:24.520* :  Is that as long as India starts entering into trade organizations,
*14:24.800- 14:28.480* :  the market could get flooded from goods from other countries,
*14:28.480- 14:31.960* :  and therefore, lessening the price of their goods here homegrown.
*14:32.420- 14:36.400* :  And the government responds, could it be colored by the fact it's an election year?
*14:36.980- 14:40.820* :  Exactly, and I think that's why you're seeing such a strong response.
*14:40.820- 14:44.860* :  Remember, last time the protests happened, it lasted a year,
*14:44.860- 14:48.380* :  and the government certainly doesn't want that to happen this time around.
*14:48.860- 14:51.880* :  Now, they have been negotiations that have been ongoing,
*14:51.880- 14:54.180* :  and the talks broke down last night.
*14:54.520- 14:58.180* :  Now, the government is saying that, look, we were close to a deal, but it didn't happen,
*14:58.180- 15:01.900* :  and they haven't really made any mention of more negotiations
*15:01.900- 15:03.960* :  that are going to happen today onwards.
*15:03.960- 15:06.280* :  But you can expect that optically,
*15:06.540- 15:10.340* :  this is not looking very good for the government and Prime Minister Modi,
*15:10.340- 15:13.920* :  who is expected to widely win a third-term in office.
*15:14.620- 15:16.260* :  Samira Hussein in Delhi.
*15:17.140- 15:20.160* :  In Senegal, the political crisis is deepening.
*15:20.700- 15:24.540* :  A second person was killed at the weekend in increasingly violent protests
*15:24.540- 15:26.700* :  against President Machi's soul's decision
*15:27.260- 15:29.220* :  to postpone the forthcoming elections.
*15:30.000- 15:32.720* :  Several opposition contenders were barred from standing,
*15:33.420- 15:36.560* :  but many say the president merely intends to cling to power
*15:37.000- 15:38.940* :  beyond the end of his second term in April.
*15:39.620- 15:43.600* :  Among the influential voices in Senegal are those of Muslim leaders.
*15:44.260- 15:46.700* :  Nicholas DeGors spoke to Ishmael Diai,
*15:47.000- 15:50.000* :  the General Secretary of Senegal's League of Emams,
*15:50.480- 15:52.840* :  about why they feel betrayed by Machi's soul.
*16:20.700- 16:22.360* :  Is not acceptable for us.
*16:23.260- 16:25.460* :  Have you shared your feelings with him?
*16:26.360- 16:28.500* :  Yeah, we shared it to him.
*16:29.040- 16:33.160* :  We communicate communication before his declaration.
*16:33.780- 16:35.900* :  To tell him we cannot accept.
*16:36.520- 16:38.340* :  He cannot postpone his election.
*16:38.760- 16:41.080* :  He cannot violate his engagement.
*16:41.620- 16:43.200* :  He has to respect his people.
*16:43.800- 16:45.760* :  And when we see he violates his engagement,
*16:46.400- 16:50.420* :  we come again to tell him that we reject what he told to us.
*16:50.900- 16:52.580* :  You are talking about violation,
*16:52.740- 16:56.100* :  but we know that there is a culture of respect
*16:56.100- 17:00.540* :  between the political leaders and the religious leaders.
*17:00.540- 17:03.800* :  We know that if you want to lead the country,
*17:04.180- 17:05.220* :  you have to be in good terms.
*17:06.020- 17:06.880* :  Do you feel betrayed?
*17:07.920- 17:09.820* :  Yeah, we feel it a lot,
*17:09.880- 17:13.140* :  because when he wants his second mandate,
*17:13.800- 17:17.360* :  he goes to all leaders, religious leaders,
*17:17.580- 17:19.000* :  to ask them to help him,
*17:19.540- 17:24.060* :  to give him a chance to have a second mandate and to finish with us.
*17:24.540- 17:26.400* :  He has no right to ask third mandate.
*17:26.880- 17:30.380* :  And that's why when he wants to postpone the election,
*17:30.380- 17:34.100* :  when he wants to make his mandate continues,
*17:34.700- 17:35.980* :  we understand that.
*17:36.560- 17:41.500* :  He does not respect his words and he feels very bad.
*17:42.500- 17:45.840* :  Do you support the initiative called Dead City?
*17:48.640- 17:51.520* :  Yeah, we have to use a peaceful way
*17:51.960- 17:54.200* :  to show him how he feels very bad.
*17:54.700- 17:57.080* :  We have not to destroy our country.
*17:57.540- 17:58.900* :  We want our country to be safe.
*17:59.400- 18:00.580* :  We want to have safety.
*18:00.600- 18:01.440* :  We want to have peace.
*18:01.840- 18:03.720* :  That's why we will use all means.
*18:04.220- 18:07.580* :  All peaceful means to show him that we are not agreeing.
*18:08.040- 18:10.180* :  Imam, so now the new date of election
*18:10.820- 18:13.000* :  is the 15th December 2024.
*18:13.500- 18:16.400* :  Are you saying that you are going to keep fighting
*18:17.420- 18:19.080* :  until he's not possible?
*18:19.260- 18:24.040* :  The question is not allow him to go up to second April.
*18:25.620- 18:26.220* :  He's not possible.
*18:27.000- 18:27.540* :  How he can do?
*18:28.060- 18:32.380* :  That's why we have to see the way to make this process continues
*18:33.100- 18:34.960* :  and to allow the candidate
*18:35.680- 18:40.880* :  to follow the processes until too much to help the election.
*18:41.460- 18:44.400* :  And the winner will be the president of the Senegal
*18:44.880- 18:45.920* :  after to operate.
*19:05.100- 19:07.920* :  The winner was twice elected Prime Minister
*19:08.440- 19:10.740* :  and one-zone Manchester City Football Club.
*19:11.360- 19:14.900* :  I heard more from our East Asia Regional Editor, Celia Hattern.
*19:15.660- 19:20.260* :  Tax in Chinawatt was convicted while he was living in exile
*19:20.460- 19:21.900* :  on a few different charges.
*19:22.020- 19:26.120* :  The most notable one is he when he sold his telecoms company,
*19:26.520- 19:29.660* :  a large stake of $2 billion worth of his company
*19:30.100- 19:31.880* :  to a Singaporean entity.
*19:31.880- 19:34.940* :  And it's believed that he didn't pay taxes on the deal.
*19:35.300- 19:36.720* :  He was also convicted of corruption
*19:36.720- 19:39.880* :  and a land deal involving his wife.
*19:40.360- 19:42.420* :  He was ousted in coup in 2006.
*19:42.420- 19:44.920* :  He then went to live in exile while he was in exile.
*19:44.920- 19:48.060* :  He was convicted of these charges.
*19:48.060- 19:51.380* :  It wasn't until he came back from exile last August
*19:51.580- 19:54.880* :  that he was actually sentenced to eight years in prison.
*19:54.940- 19:56.440* :  But right from the start,
*19:56.860- 20:00.060* :  his rivals believed that he was going to be set up
*20:00.060- 20:01.700* :  for some preferential treatment.
*20:01.760- 20:03.680* :  And that appears to have been what happened.
*20:03.820- 20:08.180* :  His sentence was quickly changed to one year by the Thai King.
*20:08.180- 20:11.980* :  And he actually never is believed to have spent a night behind bars.
*20:11.980- 20:15.000* :  He immediately went to a hospital
*20:15.440- 20:17.760* :  where he was reportedly receiving medical treatment.
*20:17.760- 20:20.900* :  But he stayed in the luxury wing of the hospital
*20:20.900- 20:22.680* :  where his belief he had his own suite.
*20:22.680- 20:25.140* :  So he's been there for the past six months.
*20:25.140- 20:27.320* :  His family says he's had two operations.
*20:27.880- 20:31.340* :  And now we understand he's quickly going to be able to go
*20:31.340- 20:34.360* :  to his mansion in Bangkok where he's going to be allowed
*20:34.360- 20:36.700* :  to spend the rest of his sentence
*20:36.700- 20:38.880* :  in another six months before he's granted parole.
*20:39.580- 20:41.440* :  He is 74 years of age.
*20:41.480- 20:44.560* :  Is there any prospect of him coming back to politics in Thailand?
*20:45.040- 20:47.960* :  Well, some might argue he's never actually left politics.
*20:48.060- 20:50.360* :  He's actually thought to have sort of ruled Thailand
*20:50.760- 20:52.440* :  from afar for many years.
*20:52.440- 20:56.220* :  That's because the party that he founded, the Bhutai party,
*20:56.660- 20:58.040* :  is still quite powerful.
*20:58.040- 20:59.880* :  In fact, the ruling party in Thailand,
*20:59.880- 21:03.100* :  they're in coalition with the party's formal rivals
*21:03.100- 21:04.680* :  from the military government.
*21:04.680- 21:08.280* :  And so it's believed he's actually incredibly powerful still.
*21:08.280- 21:10.380* :  His children are politicians.
*21:10.600- 21:13.580* :  They have key roles in government.
*21:13.580- 21:16.920* :  And so it's actually believed that he's still quite powerful.
*21:16.920- 21:19.420* :  Even though I should add that he's quite a polarizing figure.
*21:19.780- 21:23.620* :  He's beloved in the countryside and among working class people,
*21:23.620- 21:26.180* :  but other people living in Thailand cities
*21:26.640- 21:29.660* :  believe that he actually became popular by giving handouts.
*21:30.080- 21:31.700* :  And he's quite a populist politician.
*21:31.800- 21:35.720* :  So he's a very divisive figure in Thai politics.
*21:36.600- 21:37.400* :  Celia Hatton.
*21:40.700- 21:42.080* :  Still to come on this podcast,
*21:42.080- 21:46.140* :  has a UK chemical manufacturer be negligent
*21:46.640- 21:49.020* :  over the impact of pesticides in its products?
*21:54.920- 21:56.480* :  Remarkable personal stories.
*21:56.480- 21:57.300* :  Trail.
*21:57.480- 21:59.900* :  It runs through my life and runs through my story.
*22:00.140- 22:01.240* :  Deep dive documentaries.
*22:01.240- 22:03.880* :  These children are using their own bags,
*22:04.200- 22:05.200* :  not to carry books,
*22:05.500- 22:07.100* :  but they carry the drug markets
*22:07.100- 22:09.160* :  Sweden on their shoulders.
*22:09.580- 22:11.980* :  And sports, but not as you know it.
*22:12.060- 22:14.100* :  There's this massive landslide of myth
*22:14.440- 22:16.220* :  and somewhere in there is the truth.

*22:39.840- 22:43.800* :  and new energies to reduce our environmental impact.

*23:05.160- 23:07.740* :  The fallout from Pakistan's election continues.
*23:08.380- 23:11.260* :  It now seems the former Prime Minister in Rancan
*23:11.700- 23:14.780* :  is considering forming a coalition with some other parties.
*23:15.580- 23:17.620* :  This is a change from earlier today
*23:18.160- 23:19.240* :  when this was ruled out.
*23:19.880- 23:22.980* :  Mr. Khan is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence
*23:23.500- 23:24.580* :  on various charges.
*23:25.280- 23:27.720* :  Our Pakistan correspondent Caroline Davies
*23:28.000- 23:29.220* :  has been following the story.
*23:30.100- 23:32.200* :  Imran Khan, earlier today, ruled out working
*23:32.280- 23:34.380* :  with three of the biggest parties.
*23:34.540- 23:35.980* :  That was the rest of the party,
*23:35.980- 23:38.560* :  but I will buto's party and another party
*23:38.560- 23:40.180* :  that is based in Karachi.
*23:40.720- 23:42.420* :  And that what he didn't rule out was joining
*23:42.420- 23:43.640* :  with this particular party.
*23:43.860- 23:45.800* :  But he is now announced that they will be joining with.
*23:45.960- 23:47.500* :  This party is a religious party
*23:47.820- 23:50.220* :  and it has one seat in the national assembly.
*23:50.700- 23:51.840* :  But that is enough
*23:52.020- 23:54.540* :  because Imran Khan's all of his independence can now
*23:54.740- 23:55.880* :  join this particular party.
*23:55.880- 23:59.160* :  And this has one massive benefit for Imran Khan.
*23:59.680- 24:02.520* :  That is because one of the big fears that many of them had
*24:03.000- 24:05.900* :  was that these independent candidates might get picked off one by one
*24:05.900- 24:08.060* :  by some of the other big parties and reduce down
*24:08.420- 24:09.920* :  Khan's overall vote total.
*24:09.920- 24:11.760* :  So the fact that they're now joining this other party needs
*24:11.760- 24:12.920* :  that they will be in Parliament
*24:13.340- 24:15.280* :  and they won't be able to be picked off by other people
*24:15.280- 24:16.940* :  they'll have some form of party discipline.
*24:17.440- 24:20.020* :  That helps him, but it doesn't get him to a majority.
*24:20.460- 24:23.540* :  On the other side, we've also heard from Balawal buto
*24:24.080- 24:27.000* :  who has been in discussions with Nawaz Sharif's party.
*24:27.000- 24:31.000* :  He has now said that his party will support Nawaz Sharif's party
*24:31.420- 24:33.280* :  in the vote to get them into government.
*24:33.280- 24:36.400* :  But he's not guaranteeing he's going to stay in an alliance with him.
*24:36.620- 24:38.700* :  He said that they'll do that on a sort of ad hoc basis
*24:39.140- 24:41.760* :  when that works for them and they agree with what things are going through.
*24:42.300- 24:44.920* :  So the end result is that this looks like probably
*24:44.920- 24:47.720* :  Nawaz Sharif's party will end up forming a government
*24:47.740- 24:49.780* :  although we haven't had official confirmation of it yet.
*24:50.620- 24:53.780* :  But he will rule in a very fractured setup
*24:53.780- 24:56.180* :  and so it's very likely to be unstable
*24:56.180- 24:59.560* :  and quite difficult in Pakistan in politics for some time.
*24:59.820- 25:01.840* :  There are some big issues facing Pakistan
*25:02.380- 25:03.240* :  and they need stability.
*25:03.680- 25:05.980* :  Yes, so we're looking for political stability after this election
*25:06.040- 25:07.700* :  and they don't really seem to have got it.
*25:07.860- 25:09.480* :  The major issue is the economy.
*25:09.580- 25:11.320* :  They're meant to be having a deal with the IMF
*25:11.320- 25:12.940* :  that will have to be negotiated this year.
*25:13.300- 25:16.040* :  Problems with rising militancy issues on the borders.
*25:16.440- 25:18.320* :  There's lots of big issues facing Pakistan
*25:18.860- 25:21.160* :  and at the moment it doesn't look like they're having a stable government
*25:21.200- 25:22.220* :  to be able to deal with them.
*25:22.700- 25:24.820* :  Caroline Davies in Islamabad.
*25:25.700- 25:29.940* :  After months of negotiations, the US Senate has passed a foreign aid package
*25:29.940- 25:32.580* :  that will provide billions of dollars of funding
*25:32.580- 25:35.620* :  to support Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.
*25:36.380- 25:38.360* :  The vote came after an all-night session
*25:38.820- 25:41.460* :  and it was secured after 22 Senate Republicans
*25:41.580- 25:44.020* :  sided with almost all of the Democrats.
*25:44.720- 25:47.040* :  The Democrat majority leader, Charles Schumer,
*25:47.500- 25:49.800* :  said this was one of the most historic bills
*25:49.800- 25:51.680* :  the Chamber had ever passed.
*25:52.140- 25:56.040* :  These past few months have been a great test for the US Senate
*25:56.720- 25:59.400* :  to see if we could escape the constant,
*25:59.400- 26:02.060* :  centrifugal pull of partisanship
*26:02.480- 26:05.580* :  and summon the will to defend Western democracy
*26:06.340- 26:07.300* :  when it mattered most.
*26:08.360- 26:12.920* :  This morning, the Senate has resoundingly passed that test.
*26:13.340- 26:15.700* :  Are you at regional editor Danny Eberhard
*26:15.700- 26:17.620* :  told me about the importance of the bill?
*26:18.420- 26:20.380* :  It's extremely significant, Nigel.
*26:20.380- 26:22.460* :  Basically, it provides, as you mentioned,
*26:22.640- 26:24.220* :  aims to provide, funds to Israel,
*26:24.220- 26:25.740* :  about 14 billion dollars,
*26:26.220- 26:28.200* :  Taiwan and partners in the Indo-Pacific,
*26:28.200- 26:30.940* :  humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza
*26:30.940- 26:32.420* :  but also other conflict areas
*26:32.860- 26:36.120* :  and to US forces trying to defend shipping in the Red Sea.
*26:36.160- 26:38.020* :  So there's a number of things but the bulk of it,
*26:38.020- 26:40.540* :  about two thirds of that 95 billion dollars
*26:40.540- 26:42.100* :  would be destined for Ukraine
*26:42.100- 26:44.200* :  and that really matters to Ukraine.
*26:44.300- 26:47.560* :  There's lots of reports of Ukrainian soldiers
*26:47.560- 26:49.900* :  on the front line suffering weapon shortages
*26:50.560- 26:53.620* :  and the US has been trying to provide some sort of military aid
*26:53.620- 26:55.260* :  but that's kind of pitted out.
*26:55.260- 26:57.460* :  Basically, they wanted this measure passed
*26:57.860- 27:00.380* :  by the end of last year and it failed.
*27:00.380- 27:03.600* :  There's a big political dispute ongoing in the US
*27:03.600- 27:05.000* :  about the US border.
*27:05.400- 27:08.080* :  There are Republicans who want that to continue.
*27:08.360- 27:10.800* :  This year, of course, is a US presidential election.
*27:11.200- 27:14.060* :  So although President Zelensky has thanked senators
*27:14.060- 27:15.340* :  for passing this message,
*27:15.700- 27:18.060* :  the money hasn't arrived in Ukraine, so it's a what next.
*27:18.620- 27:19.900* :  This will now go to Congress.
*27:20.200- 27:21.000* :  What will happen there?
*27:21.100- 27:22.080* :  Well, the House of Representatives,
*27:22.080- 27:24.260* :  the Speaker has promised to block this bill
*27:24.580- 27:27.860* :  and a lot of Republicans have said it's dead in the water.
*27:27.860- 27:30.200* :  So there is no money so far.
*27:30.340- 27:33.320* :  It's just a step perhaps towards it
*27:33.320- 27:35.000* :  but it looks unlikely still.
*27:35.620- 27:36.160* :  Danny Abraham.
*27:37.240- 27:40.160* :  Greece may be about to come the world's first orthodox
*27:40.160- 27:43.600* :  majority country to legalize same-sex marriage.
*27:44.280- 27:46.720* :  The bill which will come to Parliament later this week
*27:46.720- 27:48.920* :  has been proposed by the Prime Minister
*27:49.440- 27:52.720* :  but dozens of his own MPs are expected to rebel
*27:52.720- 27:55.820* :  so he'll need opposition votes to get it through
*27:56.500- 27:58.860* :  and there's fierce resistance too from the church.
*27:59.600- 28:02.860* :  Our Southern Europe correspondent Mark Lowen reports from Athens.
*28:04.020- 28:04.960* :  Where's the new one?
*28:04.960- 28:05.820* :  It's all kind of sick.
*28:05.980- 28:07.060* :  Oh, I...
*28:07.140- 28:08.800* :  In her garden in Northern Athens,
*28:08.860- 28:11.540* :  four-year-old Niovi plays make-believe,
*28:11.920- 28:14.000* :  selling cakes from her imaginary shop.
*28:14.100- 28:15.880* :  Oh, wow, no need.
*28:15.960- 28:16.700* :  That's a bad one.
*28:16.840- 28:17.980* :  Did she make them?
*28:18.340- 28:18.580* :  Yes.
*28:19.240- 28:21.720* :  For her two mums, Christina and Victoria,
*28:22.240- 28:24.260* :  their dream might soon become real
*28:24.620- 28:26.140* :  as Greece stands on the brink
*28:26.140- 28:28.200* :  of legalizing same-sex marriage.
*28:28.820- 28:31.060* :  If it passes in a parliamentary vote on Thursday,
*28:31.800- 28:33.480* :  Christina and Victoria will have their marriage
*28:33.480- 28:34.700* :  which took place in Britain,
*28:35.360- 28:36.080* :  recognised in Greece.
*28:36.660- 28:37.960* :  Niovi was born in London
*28:38.440- 28:40.720* :  but when they tried to register her with the Greek embassy,
*28:40.720- 28:41.820* :  they were refused
*28:42.520- 28:43.420* :  and says Victoria,
*28:43.420- 28:44.480* :  welling with tears,
*28:45.020- 28:45.900* :  it still hurts.
*28:46.380- 28:48.680* :  I was crying here in the car.
*28:48.820- 28:52.160* :  I couldn't stop and I still bring bad memories.
*28:53.860- 28:57.360* :  It's like rejecting from your country.
*28:58.100- 28:59.800* :  What has been the impact in Greece
*29:00.440- 29:02.360* :  of not having a lower up until now?
*29:02.720- 29:03.640* :  My biggest fear
*29:04.320- 29:07.480* :  is that if anything really bad happens to Victoria
*29:08.040- 29:08.660* :  and she dies,
*29:09.300- 29:11.860* :  then the child goes to social services
*29:12.600- 29:15.200* :  to then see if any of her relatives
*29:15.200- 29:17.300* :  or Victoria relatives want to adopt her.
*29:18.240- 29:19.700* :  And if they don't want to adopt her,
*29:19.860- 29:21.440* :  then she goes into an institution,
*29:22.180- 29:23.520* :  but I have no saying.
*29:24.020- 29:25.800* :  So you could have your doors taken away from you?
*29:26.200- 29:26.740* :  Instantly.
*29:30.660- 29:31.860* :  It's a divisive issue here,
*29:31.860- 29:33.980* :  played out in angry TV talk shows,
*29:33.980- 29:38.760* :  with a recent poll showing a slim majority of 55 per cent supporting the bill.
*29:39.300- 29:41.400* :  It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt
*29:41.400- 29:43.720* :  but not have a baby through a surrogate.
*29:44.220- 29:45.200* :  Backed by the Prime Minister,
*29:45.340- 29:46.440* :  Kediakos Mitsothakis,
*29:46.780- 29:48.560* :  though not by several of his MPs,
*29:48.920- 29:51.460* :  it would make Greece the 16th member of the EU
*29:51.760- 29:53.480* :  and 36th country worldwide
*29:53.480- 29:55.240* :  to permit same-sex marriage
*29:55.720- 29:58.000* :  and the first one with a Christian Orthodox majority.
*29:58.600- 30:01.340* :  Alex Padeles is the Prime Minister's chief economic advisor
*30:01.720- 30:03.480* :  and on the committee that drafted the bill.
*30:03.680- 30:06.340* :  It is often thought that human rights and equality
*30:06.340- 30:08.300* :  is the purview of parties of the left,
*30:08.780- 30:09.320* :  but in fact,
*30:09.320- 30:11.400* :  this is coming from a centre-right party.
*30:11.400- 30:15.900* :  It's important also to recognise that a quality underlaw
*30:16.360- 30:18.100* :  and equal individual rights
*30:18.600- 30:20.740* :  is part of the ideology of the right.
*30:21.220- 30:23.640* :  If you look at a map that would paint the countries
*30:23.640- 30:26.840* :  that have already legislated marriage equality in Europe,
*30:26.840- 30:29.720* :  you will find that they are bunched in the north and in the west.
*30:29.720- 30:31.160* :  Greece will break that mold,
*30:31.160- 30:33.340* :  who will be the first country in the southeast.
*30:36.080- 30:38.120* :  Opposition is led from the powerful church
*30:38.120- 30:40.760* :  whose preletts read a letter condemning the move
*30:40.760- 30:41.920* :  in services this month.
*30:46.980- 30:47.940* :  Bishop Sederfim,
*30:47.980- 30:49.880* :  leading mass in Perea's near Athens,
*30:50.280- 30:51.640* :  is one of the staunchest opponents.
*30:52.200- 30:54.540* :  It's packed with worshippers in their Sunday best,
*30:54.540- 30:56.780* :  kissing icons and bowing heads.
*30:58.960- 31:02.700* :  He recently said he would block MPs who back the bill from his church
*31:03.100- 31:05.940* :  and would refuse to baptise children of same-sex couples
*31:06.460- 31:08.040* :  to teach them about the sin.
*31:12.580- 31:14.340* :  On Syntagma Square outside Parliament,
*31:14.400- 31:17.480* :  beneath banners reading no to same-sex marriage
*31:17.480- 31:19.560* :  and no children for perverts,
*31:19.860- 31:21.240* :  a couple of thousand people have gathered.
*31:21.620- 31:22.460* :  Their chance include,
*31:22.900- 31:24.360* :  take your hands off our kids.
*31:25.200- 31:27.380* :  There's a video with images of Christianity
*31:27.380- 31:29.220* :  and oddly bill gates.
*31:29.700- 31:32.520* :  Conspiracies about a new global order being imposed
*31:33.020- 31:35.060* :  have mixed with religious groups to protest
*31:35.060- 31:37.440* :  over what they say will destroy Greek identity.
*31:37.700- 31:38.520* :  The Bible says,
*31:38.900- 31:42.080* :  that marriage is between man and woman.
*31:42.740- 31:44.180* :  Like Sodom and Gomorrah,
*31:44.660- 31:48.160* :  the people there were practicing homosexuality
*31:48.360- 31:50.720* :  and gone destroyed the town.
*31:51.400- 31:55.600* :  It is a human right for every child to have a father and a mother
*31:56.140- 31:59.060* :  and we don't think that two homosexuals people
*31:59.520- 32:01.700* :  can give their rights an example.
*32:06.460- 32:07.740* :  Back in Niovi's garden,
*32:08.040- 32:09.540* :  she practices her bike riding,
*32:09.920- 32:10.940* :  watched by her mums,
*32:10.940- 32:14.600* :  proud of the gradual progress by her and their country.
*32:15.220- 32:16.680* :  They'll be in Parliament on Thursday,
*32:17.180- 32:18.560* :  willing the vote to pass.
*32:18.900- 32:22.180* :  I'm amazingly happy about it
*32:22.700- 32:23.720* :  and it's a start.
*32:23.720- 32:25.800* :  It's a start of accepting diverse things
*32:25.800- 32:26.920* :  in general as a country.
*32:27.360- 32:29.340* :  If the law passes, will it be tears?
*32:29.940- 32:31.380* :  Oh, that's for sure.
*32:34.460- 32:36.700* :  That report from Mark Glowen in Athens.
*32:37.680- 32:41.520* :  A BBC investigation has found that a UK chemical manufacturer
*32:42.120- 32:44.100* :  being sued in the US over alleged links
*32:44.100- 32:47.000* :  between its pesticide and Parkinson's disease
*32:47.600- 32:50.540* :  failed to look at key health records in its own research.
*32:51.320- 32:54.000* :  The weed killer Paracat is banned in Britain
*32:54.460- 32:57.080* :  but is manufactured by Sir Jenta in Yorkshire
*32:57.440- 32:59.500* :  and is exported around the world.
*33:00.140- 33:01.140* :  Here's Malcolm Pryor.
*33:01.580- 33:04.440* :  It's known as the toxic pesticide so harmful
*33:04.980- 33:06.240* :  that one sip can kill.
*33:07.100- 33:08.600* :  Now Paracwatts banned in the UK,
*33:08.600- 33:11.140* :  but it is still exported to other countries
*33:11.760- 33:14.660* :  and in the US thousands of farmers are taking legal action
*33:15.140- 33:17.600* :  claiming the chemical caused their Parkinson's disease.
*33:18.660- 33:21.240* :  The manufacturer Sir Jenta has always insisted
*33:21.240- 33:23.160* :  there's no evidence of a direct link,
*33:23.840- 33:25.700* :  but legal documents seen by the BBC
*33:26.340- 33:28.220* :  show the company's own key study of workers
*33:28.220- 33:31.260* :  making Paracwat only looked at causes of death.
*33:32.220- 33:33.880* :  Experts say at the time of the study,
*33:33.880- 33:37.200* :  Parkinson's disease was underreported on death certificates
*33:37.760- 33:38.860* :  and the company should have been looking
*33:38.860- 33:40.580* :  at all workers' health records.
*33:41.600- 33:42.860* :  But Sir Jenta told the BBC
*33:43.440- 33:45.400* :  that wouldn't have provided informative results
*33:46.040- 33:48.100* :  and it said it's conducted hundreds of studies
*33:48.720- 33:50.040* :  evaluating the safety of the weed killer.
*33:50.800- 33:52.540* :  Parkinson's campaigners are now calling
*33:52.540- 33:55.440* :  for more independent studies to be carried out.
*33:56.020- 33:56.840* :  Malcolm Pryor.
*33:59.760- 34:01.040* :  And that's all for most for now,
*34:01.040- 34:02.620* :  but there will be a new addition
*34:02.620- 34:04.540* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
*34:05.180- 34:06.820* :  If you want to comment on this podcast

*34:23.380- 34:25.160* :  and the producer was Oliver Burlow.
