*01:38.620- 01:41.140* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:43.820- 01:47.640* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 27th of February,
*01:47.640- 01:48.960* :  these are our main stories.
*01:48.960- 01:53.220* :  The leader of one of Europe's most feared drug gangs has been jailed for life.
*01:53.220- 01:56.940* :  The US President Joe Biden says progress is being made
*01:56.940- 02:01.940* :  over agreeing a ceasefire in Gaza and thousands are taking to the streets in Nigeria
*02:02.440- 02:03.900* :  over the spiraling cost of living.
*02:06.880- 02:12.040* :  Also in this podcast what would another term for Donald Trump mean for the rest of the world?
*02:12.360- 02:12.540* :  And
*02:17.620- 02:20.820* :  the mighty sound made by a minute fish.
*02:25.200- 02:29.180* :  We're going to start this podcast at a heavily guarded courthouse near Amsterdam,
*02:29.180- 02:35.100* :  ringed by mass police armed with automatic weapons and drones hovering overhead.
*02:35.680- 02:41.280* :  Security was very tight because inside and on trial were members of a huge drug trafficking
*02:41.320- 02:46.400* :  network who used murders to get their business done a few hours before we came to recall this
*02:46.400- 02:51.980* :  podcast. The judge not identified for security reasons said we're sentencing all the suspects.
*02:53.260- 02:55.900* :  We impose the following prison sentences.
*03:06.060- 03:10.240* :  Our correspondent in the Hague Anna Holigen told me more about the people's sentence today.
*03:10.980- 03:14.360* :  The undisputed they say leader of this criminal organization.
*03:14.660- 03:17.300* :  Let me tell you about him. His name is Ridoantagi.
*03:17.420- 03:19.900* :  For a long time he was the Netherlands most wanted man.
*03:19.900- 03:26.920* :  He was arrested in Dubai in 2019. He has been found guilty of a series of liquidations as
*03:26.920- 03:31.600* :  gangland murders here in the Netherlands are often referred to five liquidations, a series
*03:31.600- 03:37.180* :  of attempted murders. In fact, five people the court says were murdered over a period of just
*03:37.180- 03:42.400* :  one and a half years. A number of other attempted murders an attack on a spy shop that was
*03:42.400- 03:49.620* :  supplying this gang with equipment. He wasn't actually in court today. Eight of the 17 gang members
*03:49.620- 03:56.380* :  were and among those who received sentences the key prosecution witness, a man named Nabil B,
*03:56.380- 04:02.560* :  was given a reduced sentence of 10 years because it was primarily his testimony. He was involved in
*04:02.560- 04:08.860* :  some of these attacks that helped the prosecution arrive at these charges and ultimately the judge
*04:08.860- 04:13.720* :  delivered these sentences today. Anna, to what extent is this being seen as a key moment in the
*04:13.720- 04:19.320* :  fight against illicit drug gangs? I think this has made the Netherlands confront a very dark
*04:19.320- 04:26.320* :  underworld that is increasingly seeping through into mainstream society. Just before the hearing
*04:26.320- 04:31.960* :  began, the judge talked about three other assassinations that you may have heard of,
*04:32.360- 04:37.440* :  the killing of the key prosecution witnesses lawyer and investigates a journalist Peter
*04:37.440- 04:42.900* :  Arda Freese who was acting as a confident for the key prosecution witness. Another assassination,
*04:42.900- 04:48.660* :  those weren't dealt with as part of this trial. They are being handled in separate proceedings,
*04:48.660- 04:55.860* :  but drugs are a huge problem here and it's partly the relaxed policy on soft drugs that attracts
*04:55.860- 05:01.420* :  these kinds of criminal networks. So, Ridduan Targi has been found guilty of leading what
*05:01.420- 05:06.540* :  prosecutors said was one of the biggest and most influential drugs muggling networks in Europe.
*05:07.080- 05:13.260* :  Anna Holigen. Since the conflict in Gaza began in October, there has been just one brief
*05:13.260- 05:17.620* :  letter up in the fighting. For seven days at the end of November, there was a ceasefire,
*05:17.620- 05:23.240* :  but since then, the bombardments have continued day and night. For weeks, talks in Paris and Qatar
*05:23.240- 05:28.980* :  have tried to lay the foundations for a new hawk to the violence. Now, the US President Joe Biden says
*05:29.000- 05:33.800* :  they could be about to bear fruit. Well, I hope by the beginning of the weekend,
*05:34.360- 05:39.320* :  I mean, the end of the weekend. My last security adviser tells me that we're close, we're close,
*05:39.340- 05:44.020* :  not done yet. And my hope is, by the next Monday, we'll have a ceasefire.
*05:44.960- 05:49.200* :  Shortly after that comment, President Biden also appeared on the television network NBC,
*05:49.200- 05:55.220* :  where he said Israel had agreed in principle to pause its attacks in the Gaza Strip during the
*05:55.220- 06:01.880* :  Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts on March 10. Scott Anderson is the UN aid agency
*06:01.880- 06:05.740* :  Unruh's deputy director of affairs in Gaza. He's in Raffa.
*06:06.140- 06:09.720* :  There's very much pressure cooker. People are very desperate for any good news.
*06:10.540- 06:13.800* :  And a ceasefire would go a long way to giving people some relief
*06:15.040- 06:19.940* :  because people are scared. Over 100,000 people have been impacted by this conflict,
*06:20.240- 06:24.780* :  nearly 30,000 have died in Gaza. Over 70,000 have been injured.
*06:25.620- 06:29.540* :  There's very few families that you can find that have not been impacted in some way,
*06:29.540- 06:34.260* :  either through death or injury. And as I said, there's also just a grain of hope that there
*06:34.260- 06:37.120* :  will be a ceasefire and people can begin to rebuild their lives.
*06:37.560- 06:43.160* :  Hope too for the remaining 130 Israeli hostages and their families still held by Hamas.
*06:43.620- 06:49.320* :  Shaiwankeh's son Omar is one of those hostages. He was abducted to Gaza on October 7th
*06:49.400- 06:55.160* :  from the Supernova Desert Festival. I heard for more than 90 days ago, we had an evidence from
*06:55.160- 07:00.000* :  the release hostages there. But it was 90 days ago and since then we don't have any
*07:00.560- 07:05.100* :  information about him. There is now negotiation and we are full of faith that
*07:05.100- 07:10.600* :  something is going through this negotiation. Omar is a colitis disease.
*07:10.600- 07:17.200* :  He's a chronic disease and a stomach. I believe he needs to get out to get his medicine,
*07:17.200- 07:22.940* :  to get his health care, to get him medical aid because we know he don't get anything over there.
*07:23.300- 07:27.960* :  I got more details about the terms of a possible ceasefire from our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*07:27.960- 07:34.640* :  Yolanda. From what we understand, the framework deal that was talked about in these talks in
*07:34.640- 07:39.720* :  Paris recently with the Israelis involved, also the cataries and Egyptians who've been serving
*07:39.720- 07:45.060* :  as mediators and with US involvement as well. This, according to the Reuters news agency,
*07:45.060- 07:51.120* :  produced a sort of draft proposal that includes a 40-day pause in all military operations,
*07:51.120- 07:55.540* :  the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to 1,
*07:55.900- 08:01.340* :  and Reuters is quoting a senior source close to the talks. This proposed ceasefire also involves
*08:01.340- 08:06.200* :  allowing hospitals and bakeries and guards are to be repaired and a big increase in the amount
*08:06.200- 08:12.560* :  of aid going into Gaza, something like 500 aid lorries entering each day. But although we've had
*08:12.560- 08:18.420* :  these very positive comments from President Biden after he appeared on a late night show in New
*08:18.420- 08:25.660* :  York, we have been hearing from both the Israeli media quoting unnamed Israeli officials and also
*08:25.660- 08:31.300* :  the BBC's been hearing from Hamas officials who are much less positive about how close we are to
*08:31.300- 08:36.080* :  a new deal. Yeah, we've heard lots of near misses over the last few weeks in terms of whether or not
*08:36.080- 08:42.000* :  a ceasefire will start, and we're also hearing that Prime Minister Netanyahu is still saying that
*08:42.620- 08:47.580* :  any ceasefire if and when it comes will only be temporary and that offensive on Raffa will go ahead.
*08:48.400- 08:52.920* :  Indeed, and this is really linked to the key sticking point because you have Israel's
*08:52.920- 08:59.140* :  insistence that any temporary true steel will not guarantee an end to the war, and that is really
*08:59.140- 09:05.020* :  precisely what Hamas is demanding. What it says is that an end to Israel's aggression on Gaza and
*09:05.020- 09:11.560* :  a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops. Now, Israel is vowed not to halt its efforts until it is
*09:11.560- 09:17.040* :  dismantled. Hamas said it will destroy the group consistently since so shocking 7th of October
*09:17.040- 09:23.480* :  attacks by Hamas fighters on the south of Israel. So this is really where we have the kind of the
*09:23.480- 09:30.560* :  crux of the issue, and there was also Hamas officials speaking to one of our BBC staff members
*09:31.100- 09:35.960* :  who told him that the priority was not to exchange hostages, but to stop this war.
*09:35.960- 09:41.380* :  You'll land now in Jerusalem. Now, what would a second Donald Trump presidential term mean for
*09:41.380- 09:46.180* :  the rest of the world? Now that he's all but certain to win the Republican nomination, there's
*09:46.180- 09:51.520* :  been intense focus on some of the former presidents' latest foreign policy comments in particular,
*09:51.520- 09:56.400* :  his suggestion that he'd let Russia attack NATO countries that don't meet the alliance's
*09:56.400- 10:01.620* :  spending guidelines. From Washington, our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman went to
*10:01.620- 10:07.460* :  find out at CPAC, that's the annual gathering of conservative activists. I've got exposed
*10:07.460- 10:14.480* :  fraud flashing here. What's that about? Once upon a time, this event took in conservatives of all
*10:14.480- 10:24.740* :  stripes. Now that's changed. These days, the pinball game being showcased by a delegate is called
*10:24.740- 10:30.580* :  January 6th insurrection. CPAC is dominated by followers of Donald Trump.
*10:30.740- 10:36.060* :  It's the Biden administration that wants to spend an unlimited amount of money in Ukraine.
*10:36.380- 10:40.260* :  Do you think the US should stay in NATO? No, I think we should abolish all the cool kids clubs.
*10:40.500- 10:44.920* :  The counter-argument is that if the US isn't there for Ukraine, Putin will march in,
*10:45.100- 10:49.840* :  and the rest of Europe is at risk. Isn't that concern? No, that's really not. My concern is America.
*10:50.280- 10:55.120* :  This is the base helping drive Mr. Trump's pronouncements about home and abroad,
*10:55.920- 11:00.160* :  and sparking a fresh wave of concern in Europe, his comments on NATO.
*11:00.160- 11:03.940* :  One of the presidents of a big country stood up said, well,
*11:03.940- 11:10.300* :  sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said, no, I would not
*11:10.300- 11:14.720* :  protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay.
*11:15.220- 11:21.360* :  This, say, his opponents is destabilizing rhetoric, a signal to Russia that the US under Trump
*11:21.360- 11:28.820* :  could abandon European security. Make diplomacy great again. Backstage, I meet Katie McFarland,
*11:29.180- 11:33.200* :  Mr. Trump's deputy national security adviser during his first year in power.
*11:33.880- 11:39.400* :  She sees Trump's words as bravado, an attention grabbing tactic to further boost defense spending
*11:39.400- 11:45.380* :  in Europe, but not to abandon NATO. But how about what some see as his embrace of Putin
*11:45.380- 11:51.540* :  with US weapons transfers to Ukraine now stalled for months by his Republican allies in Congress?
*11:51.800- 11:56.360* :  Trump has said that he'll solve the Ukraine war in one day. I think it's probably a week.
*11:56.840- 12:00.780* :  I don't think he'll do it in one day, but here's how he would do it. He said, I'll go to Putin,
*12:00.780- 12:05.260* :  and I'll say, you go to the negotiating table or I'm going to give Ukraine offensive weapons,
*12:05.260- 12:11.100* :  go to the Zelensky and say, you go to the negotiating table or I'm not going to give you any weapons.
*12:11.500- 12:15.980* :  I mean, all Ukrainians and many Europeans would see that as effectively a Ukrainian surrender,
*12:15.980- 12:19.460* :  because it's... What's the alternative? Well, because the war for 20 years?
*12:19.500- 12:23.780* :  But they would see the invasion as unjustified. I don't know. For a war Putin, for his behavior.
*12:23.780- 12:26.940* :  But on the other hand, let's be practical about this. It's a war of attrition.
*12:26.940- 12:30.200* :  Who wins a war of attrition? You tell me. The bigger country, the richer country.
*12:30.200- 12:35.360* :  Away from the convention, I spoke to Wana Langesky, now with the defense think tank, Rusy.
*12:35.740- 12:39.520* :  She ran the NATO communications team for nearly a decade and a half,
*12:39.520- 12:42.100* :  and was there during the entire Trump term.
*12:42.340- 12:47.100* :  Donald Trump is an unpredictable politician in all the meetings that I was in.
*12:47.100- 12:53.180* :  You were never quite sure how long they would take. It was always about keeping people on edge.
*12:53.500- 12:57.240* :  She says this did help push NATO countries to spend more on defense,
*12:57.240- 13:02.040* :  but this was part of a trend that actually began well before his presidency
*13:02.540- 13:05.440* :  and spiked later, due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*13:06.280- 13:09.960* :  She warns that if Mr Trump's talk of leaving some NATO countries
*13:09.960- 13:12.320* :  undefended is fraught with danger.
*13:12.600- 13:19.220* :  Any discussion about a two-tier alliance where only some allies, those to invest two percent
*13:19.220- 13:22.800* :  on defense, would get security guarantees, while others would not,
*13:22.800- 13:29.540* :  is deeply destabilizing and can undermine NATO deterrence for all allies, not just for some.
*13:29.800- 13:35.420* :  So would a second term of America first leave Europe at more risk of attack by Russia?
*13:35.960- 13:38.920* :  The facts on the ground in Ukraine will matter.
*13:39.460- 13:43.240* :  But says Natalie Tochi of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome,
*13:43.240- 13:48.400* :  Mr Trump only accelerates a trend in which the US's peer rival China
*13:49.060- 13:50.840* :  will dominate its security thinking.
*13:51.040- 13:57.840* :  Trump sort of catalyzes this moment and draws attention to a deeper problem
*13:58.480- 14:06.960* :  in a world of multiple powers in which the US will not have the hegemonic role that it had
*14:07.460- 14:12.020* :  in the past. It will be less and less committed to European security.
*14:12.020- 14:16.960* :  I think that is a trend that has been going on basically since 2008.
*14:16.960- 14:23.480* :  So since Obama, we're accelerating towards the world and despite everything that's happening,
*14:24.260- 14:28.840* :  we're still not really stepping up to the plate in terms of action.
*14:29.240- 14:33.940* :  The US has been retrenching from Europe more or less since the end of the Cold War.
*14:33.940- 14:39.740* :  Donald Trump's foreign policy proposals insofar as they are clear only add boosters,
*14:39.740- 14:42.800* :  unpredictability to a strategic trend.
*14:43.480- 14:47.600* :  The US served as Europe's security umbrella for most of the 20th century.
*14:48.100- 14:53.460* :  The long-term promise of that cover has been wearing thinner as the showers of war
*14:53.460- 14:59.100* :  come closer. Tom Bateman, now to an extraordinary discovery.
*15:04.240- 15:08.580* :  That rather ominous sound comes from one of the world's smallest fish,
*15:09.260- 15:16.620* :  just a centimeter long. The translucent Damionella cerebrum lives in mountain streams in Myanmar.
*15:16.620- 15:22.200* :  We've actually had to reduce the volume quite a bit because scientists say it comes in at 140
*15:22.200- 15:27.660* :  decibels, loud enough to cause human pain or even hearing loss. So how does something
*15:27.660- 15:32.320* :  social makes so much noise? A question for our environment correspondent, Matt McGraw.
*15:33.140- 15:37.040* :  Indeed, it does make an awful lot of noise, Nick. It's one of those, I suppose, evolution
*15:37.040- 15:41.920* :  reactivants of history, the researchers in Berlin, they use this tiny fish, it's transparent,
*15:41.920- 15:46.300* :  they use it in their experiments so they can see its brain, its organs. They hadn't really
*15:46.300- 15:50.680* :  noticed the noise, to be honest, with you. When they did, they said about investigating it,
*15:50.960- 15:56.220* :  they found that this tiny 12-millimeter fish was pumping out 140 decibels, as you say,
*15:56.220- 16:01.900* :  the equivalent of a gunshot. It does this using its muscles to beat on its own swim bladder.
*16:01.900- 16:06.800* :  That's an organ within it that keeps it afloat. According to Verity Cook, the lead author
*16:06.800- 16:11.840* :  on this piece of research, it's all about evolution and it's about communication and hierarchy.
*16:12.520- 16:17.260* :  When I'm recording the notice that some of them will make these really, really long sounds and
*16:17.260- 16:22.060* :  some of them are very quiet. We know that when you have maybe like eight males together in a large
*16:22.060- 16:27.980* :  tank, but three of them will dominate the sound production and the other ones will be quiet. So
*16:27.980- 16:32.260* :  we think there is some sort of, perhaps some sort of hierarchy or something to do with the sounds.
*16:32.960- 16:38.340* :  They're all about competition. It is not the loudest fish in the world. Why is this discovery significant?
*16:39.220- 16:43.380* :  I think it's one of those shocking things that scientists think they know everything in some respects
*16:43.380- 16:48.040* :  and then nature comes along and surprises them. As you say, it's not the biggest or the loudest fish,
*16:48.040- 16:52.800* :  but it's one of the loudest for its size. In fact, it's probably the loudest for its size
*16:53.200- 16:57.340* :  and it's given scientists the sense of, wow, there's loads of new things to discover here and it
*16:57.340- 17:02.060* :  just wasn't something they were expecting. Yeah, and this fish comes from small streams
*17:02.060- 17:08.620* :  in this rural area of Myanmar and making these discoveries in those kind of areas is very
*17:08.620- 17:13.520* :  important because these kind of ecosystems could disappear, couldn't they? Absolutely, and they
*17:13.520- 17:18.720* :  think that its location is key to this massive sound that it makes, that having evolved in these
*17:18.720- 17:24.180* :  murky waters, not being able to see very far, it uses this sound as a way of communicating with
*17:24.180- 17:28.160* :  other members of its species. It's only made by males and only when they're in company. So
*17:28.540- 17:33.200* :  they've evolved over a time to produce this huge sound and the scientists still don't know
*17:33.460- 17:37.860* :  what impact it has on them or on fish that come nearby. It could be deafening them just as much
*17:37.860- 17:45.560* :  as it defends us. Matt McGraw. Still to come on the Global News podcast, because in the middle of the
*17:45.560- 17:54.760* :  night there was a big bang on the side of the hall and we rushed out on deck to see a very angry
*17:54.760- 17:59.060* :  male. The perils of being stranded at sea for more than a hundred days.
*18:06.780- 18:12.640* :  For just as long as Hollywood has been tinseltown, there have been suspicions about what lurks
*18:12.640- 18:19.240* :  behind the glitz and glamour. And for a while, those suspicions grew into something much bigger
*18:19.240- 18:24.380* :  and much darker. Are you a member of the Communist Party? Or have you ever been a member of the Communist
*18:24.700- 18:31.780* :  Party? I'm Una Chaplin and from CBC podcasts and the BBC World Service. This is Hollywood Exiles.
*18:32.480- 18:39.100* :  It's about a battle for the political soul of America and the battlefield was Hollywood. Search
*18:39.100- 18:42.640* :  for Hollywood Exiles, wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:49.300- 18:55.160* :  Life is getting much tougher in Nigeria. Prices have shot up by a third in the last year.
*18:55.760- 19:00.720* :  Cynthia Adieri is a nurse in Abuja who is joining a two-day nationwide strike.
*19:01.440- 19:05.320* :  Things have been unbearable for the common man. The cost of living has
*19:05.320- 19:10.700* :  tripled. I went to the market yesterday and I could barely buy nothing.
*19:11.060- 19:16.320* :  Wasn't able to buy vegetables and fruits to make meals for my family. Is that bad?
*19:17.280- 19:22.420* :  Unions who've called the strike want the government to take action to help people make ends meets.
*19:22.540- 19:28.280* :  President Bollot De Nubo, who came to power last May, is going full out for economic reform,
*19:28.280- 19:34.500* :  including slashing fuel subsidies. Speaking to the BBC, the finance minister Wala Eden admitted
*19:34.500- 19:37.900* :  there were difficulties in the economy and said action was being taken.
*19:38.440- 19:42.860* :  I won't call it a crisis, but I would definitely call it a cost of living spike.
*19:43.420- 19:49.120* :  There is actually food in the market. It's the purchasing power of individuals that is really
*19:49.120- 19:54.020* :  at the question at the moment. And that's why there's an attempt to put money into households,
*19:54.020- 19:57.100* :  put money into the hands of individuals so they can purchase.
*19:57.840- 20:00.060* :  Money Jones is our corresponding based in Lagos.
*20:00.540- 20:04.620* :  So it seems a few thousand people have shown up at this protest that's organized by the main
*20:04.620- 20:11.300* :  umbrella organization for unions in Nigeria. And they want better paid. They want an increase
*20:11.300- 20:16.460* :  to kind of the minimum wage. They want the government to stick by an agreement that they
*20:16.460- 20:20.740* :  done last year to increase the pay of civil servants. And they also want the government to tackle
*20:20.740- 20:25.320* :  some of the economic hardships that the people that dialed in have kind of talked about.
*20:25.320- 20:30.020* :  The high cost of food, the high cost of fuel. They want the government to tackle all of these
*20:30.020- 20:33.160* :  things because for the average Nigerian life has been very hard lately.
*20:33.540- 20:37.920* :  Well, the trouble is though, this new president has come in saying, look, we're going to shake things
*20:37.980- 20:42.600* :  up. We're going to stop these high subsidies for people. And it's clearly not what a lot of
*20:42.600- 20:49.420* :  people want. How does he please the people but also continue with what he sees as the best way forward?
*20:50.300- 20:54.900* :  Yeah, that's the difficult spot that he finds himself in. I think a lot of Nigerians accept that
*20:54.900- 21:00.760* :  the fuel subsidy was an inefficient way of spending government money. But I think that they thought
*21:00.900- 21:05.240* :  that once the government removed it, first of all, that it would remove it slower more gradually.
*21:05.940- 21:10.380* :  And secondly, that it would provide some financial help to the poorest members of society.
*21:10.760- 21:15.080* :  So give them a little bit of money so they could deal with the change. Those things haven't happened
*21:15.080- 21:19.900* :  and the problem with that is because so much of the economy relies on fuel like a lot of other
*21:19.900- 21:24.600* :  countries food has to be transported. It costs a lot more, but the thing that's different about
*21:24.600- 21:30.480* :  Nigeria is that a lot of businesses also rely on fuel generators, petrol generators to run their
*21:30.480- 21:36.040* :  businesses. So if the cost of fuel goes up, because of power goes up for them, then it just means
*21:36.040- 21:40.700* :  that everything is kind of through the roof right now. And as your listeners have kind of said
*21:40.700- 21:44.860* :  dialing in, they can't afford even the basics like rice, vegetables, etc.
*21:45.440- 21:51.640* :  Manny Jones, it is 11 days since the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in a prison
*21:51.640- 21:57.500* :  in Siberia, kept behind bars on charges of extremism. And now one of Russia's best known
*21:57.500- 22:03.780* :  human rights campaigners Olig Olov has been jailed for discrediting the army. Our Russia editor
*22:03.780- 22:08.920* :  Steve Rosenberg reports. Olig Olov is one of Russia's most respected human rights
*22:08.920- 22:14.440* :  campaigners. He'd been convicted last year of repeatedly discrediting the Russian armed forces
*22:14.860- 22:18.760* :  through his public criticism of the war in Ukraine, and had been given a fine.
*22:19.540- 22:25.680* :  Two lenient, said prosecutors, and a retrial was ordered. That has now concluded with Mr.
*22:25.680- 22:31.700* :  Olov being sent to prison for two and a half years. The tougher sentence, a reflection of the
*22:31.700- 22:38.040* :  intensifying crackdown on dissent in Russia. Steve Rosenberg. Two Senegal now, where elections
*22:38.040- 22:43.040* :  were supposed to take place last weekend, but were postponed by President Mackie Sal, who offered
*22:43.040- 22:48.940* :  no alternative date. The relatively stable West African country has since been thrust into chaos
*22:48.940- 22:54.220* :  with angry protesters clashing with riot police in the streets of Dakar. Almost all opposition
*22:54.220- 22:59.660* :  candidates have also refused to meet Mr. Sal to agree a new election day. One of them,
*22:59.660- 23:05.780* :  Antibabaka, has been speaking to the BBC is Davina Gupta. The President Mackie Sal's ultimate
*23:05.780- 23:11.200* :  goal is to delay the presidential election as long as possible and to implement his political
*23:11.200- 23:17.760* :  schemes. Now he's suggesting a time around summer for the elections, and it's a true disgrace
*23:17.760- 23:23.680* :  to Senegalese democracy. It's why 17 out of the 19th candidates like myself,
*23:23.740- 23:28.420* :  validated by the Constitutional Council, did not participate in this parade.
*23:28.720- 23:34.280* :  His mandate is terminating on April 2nd. If the President really wanted to leave,
*23:34.280- 23:39.660* :  he just would have set a date for the elections. So there is something really dark hidden behind
*23:39.660- 23:45.740* :  this and we are worried. You said you're among those 17 of the 19 presidential hopefuls who have
*23:45.740- 23:51.680* :  not turned up for the national dialogue to set an election date and resolve this. So what's next?
*23:52.180- 23:58.740* :  What's next is very clear. Yesterday we went to the Constitutional Council to send another
*23:58.740- 24:05.540* :  request. Today is going to be declared a dead city where businesses, everything will be closed down
*24:05.540- 24:12.560* :  and it will show the state in which our country is actually really tomorrow. We are having a dialogue,
*24:12.560- 24:17.300* :  but this dialogue is going to be with the nation, with the people, with the workers.
*24:17.300- 24:21.400* :  The dialogue with the people does it also mean that you will be protesting again,
*24:21.400- 24:26.360* :  because you were protesting in January among other leaders and you were then arrested.
*24:26.880- 24:32.500* :  We will be protesting again. We cannot not protest and these are usually very peaceful
*24:33.100- 24:39.240* :  protest, but the President Pakistan and his administration never allow the people to actually
*24:39.240- 24:46.160* :  peacefully protest. So they always send the police forces to actually attack and arrest,
*24:46.160- 24:52.680* :  like I was arrested a few weeks ago, and we will keep going as long as we can, because this is
*24:52.680- 24:58.320* :  the fight for our democracy and we cannot allow it to keep happening and just send the wrong
*24:58.320- 25:04.220* :  signals to the world. I just want to ask you very briefly, why is it difficult for President
*25:04.220- 25:09.440* :  Microsoft to schedule a day, and what does that day or date that the opposition leaders want?
*25:09.440- 25:17.240* :  The right date should be any date before April 2nd. Any date before April 2nd before the end of
*25:17.240- 25:22.100* :  his term so that he can actually pass power. If you don't set it before that, beforehand,
*25:22.100- 25:27.660* :  it means that he's going to stay in power. That was the opposition politician, Anta Babaka.
*25:28.900- 25:33.620* :  And we end this podcast with perhaps the ultimate test of any marriage. One British couple who
*25:33.620- 25:38.940* :  in the 1970s decided to leave normal life behind. They sold their house, built a small boat,
*25:39.540- 25:42.880* :  and set sail for New Zealand. But then something went very wrong.
*25:43.680- 25:50.220* :  It was a little of the night and we passed a wailing ship. There was a big bang on the side of the
*25:50.220- 25:58.460* :  hall. And we rushed out on deck to see a very angry whale. It was wounded and we
*25:58.820- 26:04.500* :  assumed that it had been injured by this wailing ship. And whether it took vengeance on our whole
*26:04.500- 26:11.200* :  or not, I don't know, but it certainly hit us. Water's pouring and we couldn't stop it.
*26:11.620- 26:17.700* :  And the time came when we looked at each of them. I said, it's time to leave. We expected to be
*26:17.700- 26:24.060* :  picked up within a week. We were on the shipping route. And we thought to be hundreds of ships
*26:24.060- 26:29.820* :  going along the route. We didn't see any, of course. Well, in fact, Maurice and Marilyn were
*26:29.820- 26:35.900* :  sent a drift for 117 days in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. There a remarkable story of survival
*26:35.900- 26:41.340* :  has now been told in a new book by Sophie Elmerst. She's been speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson.
*26:41.940- 26:46.240* :  They didn't have much to eat or to drink. They were kind of slowly starving as the weeks went by.
*26:46.240- 26:52.940* :  But she was nothing if not resourceful. And one of her many kind of survival mechanisms and
*26:52.960- 26:57.900* :  something to keep their minds occupied, as much as anything else, was to invent a elaborate
*26:57.900- 27:03.520* :  and very 1970s style dinner party menus, which she would write down laboriously in her diaries,
*27:04.020- 27:09.160* :  multi courses, many cakes. It was just, as I say, yeah, one of one of many kind of roses she had
*27:09.160- 27:15.380* :  to keep them alive. So this is an extraordinary tale of survival of frustrated dreams. Now suddenly
*27:15.380- 27:20.600* :  neither Marilyn nor Maurice are with us still. So how have you been able to tell their tale?
*27:20.860- 27:26.480* :  No, surviving friends and relatives who've been incredibly generous to me about remembering them
*27:26.560- 27:30.080* :  and they were such sort of vivid and particular characters both in their own way that there's been
*27:30.080- 27:34.580* :  a lot of rich material to draw on. And they were also sort of briefly kind of internationally famous
*27:34.580- 27:40.600* :  once they were rescued. So there was lots of archive material as well. Did they see the comedy as well
*27:40.600- 27:47.000* :  as the tragedy in this shattered dream? Well, it's a good question. I think they were both
*27:47.340- 27:51.460* :  deeply pragmatic people in their own way, although one very much an optimist and one very much
*27:51.460- 27:56.360* :  pessimist that being Maurice. So I don't know if they almost saw either comedy or tragedy. I think
*27:56.360- 28:01.520* :  they were more just seeing this kind of sort of endurance test. And that's the extraordinary thing.
*28:01.520- 28:07.020* :  We talk about lockdown and how tough it was because it was tough for many people. But being locked
*28:07.020- 28:14.640* :  on a boat with no idea when or whether you will ever be rescued without food and water. Now that
*28:14.640- 28:19.780* :  really is a test. Right. And it's a test of a marriage as well. And I think that's what always
*28:19.780- 28:22.980* :  intrigued me from right from the start. I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of them before that they
*28:22.980- 28:27.240* :  weren't just sort of part of our collective memory, I guess, because it was such an extreme but
*28:27.620- 28:31.940* :  also such an intimate story. And what does that do to a marriage? What does that do to use an
*28:31.940- 28:34.480* :  individual? But what does that do to your relationship? Presumably while you're alive for
*28:34.480- 28:39.160* :  if your choices are limited. Yeah. You got to go off with someone else. That's true.
*28:39.160- 28:44.240* :  Go for a walk. That's true. But I guess it's a testament to there. And maybe we would all be
*28:44.360- 28:49.100* :  let's hope we'd all be as resourceful as they were, but a testament to their kind of devotion to
*28:49.100- 28:55.960* :  each other as much as anything that they survived. And that's all from us for now. But there will be
*28:55.960- 29:00.660* :  a new addition of the global news podcast later on. If you want a comment on this podcast or
