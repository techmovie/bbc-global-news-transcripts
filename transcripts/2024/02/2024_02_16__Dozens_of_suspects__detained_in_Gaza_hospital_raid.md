*00:55.520- 00:57.780* :  was sworn in as Argentine as president.
*00:58.260- 01:01.960* :  Can he follow through on his promises to slash government and tame inflation
*01:02.620- 01:06.740* :  and do Argentinians have the patience to see if it's the right idea?

*01:20.840- 01:24.940* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.840- 01:29.460* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and did the early hours of Friday the 16th of February.
*01:29.460- 01:31.140* :  These are our main stories.
*01:31.220- 01:35.180* :  Israel says it's detained suspects and seized weapons
*01:35.180- 01:37.780* :  during its raid on a key hospital in Gaza.
*01:38.240- 01:39.860* :  A doctor there gave us his account.
*01:50.820- 01:55.300* :  The US confirms it's monitoring what it calls an anti-satellite weapon.
*01:55.300- 01:56.700* :  Developed by the Russians.
*01:57.300- 01:58.980* :  Also, up up in the air.
*02:03.160- 02:06.060* :  Crying babies on planes spark a heated debate.
*02:08.760- 02:09.580* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:10.040- 02:10.860* :  We've never gotten any money.
*02:11.120- 02:11.720* :  We've got to go out.
*02:12.040- 02:13.340* :  Everything's expensive now.
*02:14.560- 02:15.820* :  My salary at work's gone down,
*02:16.020- 02:18.540* :  so I've stopped going out to buy clothes and eating out
*02:18.660- 02:19.640* :  in order to save money.
*02:19.640- 02:20.280* :  That's it.
*02:21.020- 02:23.640* :  Japan and the UK go into recession
*02:24.260- 02:30.140* :  and Greek MPs have voted in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and adoption.
*02:34.960- 02:39.500* :  The Israeli army says it's detained dozens of Hamas gunmen and found weapons,
*02:39.500- 02:41.520* :  including explosives and mortars,
*02:41.880- 02:45.440* :  after entering NASA Hospital in Khan Unis in southern Gaza.
*02:45.980- 02:49.620* :  The IDF said it's been carrying out a precise and limited operation
*02:49.960- 02:52.600* :  which would ensure that patients and medics were safe
*02:52.600- 02:55.620* :  with no need for patients to evacuate the complex.
*02:56.500- 03:00.900* :  But medical staff inside NASA Hospital described chaos and shooting.
*03:01.420- 03:03.720* :  They reported that at least one person had died
*03:03.720- 03:05.440* :  and several others were injured
*03:05.780- 03:07.480* :  and that they'd been forced to flee.
*03:07.500- 03:10.340* :  Khaled Al-Sair is a surgeon at the hospital.
*03:11.040- 03:13.440* :  Shooting, spawn breaks every minute.
*03:13.880- 03:18.160* :  And every hour we have new sanctions from the Israeli army side.
*03:18.500- 03:22.200* :  Since the early morning, they communicated with the head of the administration of the hospital
*03:22.900- 03:25.880* :  to remove all the patients into one building.
*03:26.760- 03:32.740* :  It was very difficult because the only patients left is patients who are unable to walk.
*03:33.220- 03:40.480* :  And now the Israeli army, they are invading and shooting inside every floor in the building.
*03:40.960- 03:44.720* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem Paul Adams was listening to the latest briefing
*03:44.720- 03:50.040* :  on the NASA Hospital raid by IDF Spooksman, Rear Admiral Daniel Higari.
*03:50.200- 03:55.460* :  He said that dozens of Hamas gunmen had been detained inside the hospital.
*03:56.040- 04:00.340* :  The Israeli military has been interrogating some of those that they have captured.
*04:00.980- 04:02.980* :  Daniel Higari named three of them.
*04:02.980- 04:07.160* :  He said one of them was a Hamas ambulance driver
*04:07.160- 04:14.660* :  who had already confessed to transporting an Israeli hostage from Israel into Gaza on October 7th.
*04:14.780- 04:19.860* :  He also said that as a result of the interrogations that have been going on during the day
*04:19.860- 04:24.660* :  and coupled with testimony from former hostages who have been released,
*04:25.360- 04:34.080* :  the Israeli military is now confident that Israeli hostages were indeed held inside NASA hospital at one stage.
*04:34.700- 04:39.100* :  And also that the bodies of dead hostages had also been stored.
*04:39.100- 04:46.240* :  He did add, however, that no evidence of hostages alive or dead had yet been found
*04:46.240- 04:48.320* :  and that the search was still going on.
*04:48.740- 04:53.900* :  Of course, the Israeli version of events is at odds to reports from the medics there,
*04:53.900- 05:00.460* :  some of whom are saying that Israeli troops had fired into a ward killing one patient and injuring others.
*05:00.780- 05:04.100* :  Yes, we've had no confirmation of that from the Israelis.
*05:04.100- 05:06.360* :  They say that they are looking into those reports.
*05:06.420- 05:09.260* :  We don't often hear back in cases like this.
*05:09.260- 05:15.220* :  Clearly, this was an armed incursion into a hospital by special forces
*05:16.000- 05:20.600* :  into a place where they believed that Hamas gunmen were lurking.
*05:21.000- 05:25.020* :  And so consequently, they will have gone in, guns blazing, if you like,
*05:25.660- 05:27.080* :  expecting to encounter resistance.
*05:27.120- 05:30.340* :  And so perhaps it is not surprising that for the civilians,
*05:30.340- 05:34.760* :  the patients, the medical staff who were in the building at the time,
*05:34.820- 05:39.420* :  they would have been privy to a pretty unpleasant experience to say the least.
*05:39.920- 05:41.720* :  The hospital has not been evacuated.
*05:41.720- 05:45.920* :  They saw civilians moving away from the area this morning
*05:45.920- 05:50.500* :  that suggests that they were heeding Israeli warnings for civilians to leave.
*05:50.580- 05:56.880* :  But we think there are still a few hundred patients and staff inside the hospital.
*05:56.880- 06:03.840* :  And we saw a video earlier this evening of patients crammed into one of the corridors of the hospital.
*06:04.180- 06:09.880* :  We don't yet know exactly how well NASA hospital will be able to continue to function
*06:10.760- 06:12.540* :  after this raid is over.
*06:12.720- 06:13.380* :  Maybe it will.
*06:13.820- 06:15.200* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*06:16.360- 06:20.780* :  The difficulties faced by Ukraine's military were front and center of a NATO defence
*06:20.780- 06:23.100* :  minister's meeting, which ended on Thursday.
*06:23.740- 06:28.520* :  Speaking at the meeting, the head of NATO Jens Stoltenberg said that Washington's
*06:28.520- 06:33.940* :  delay in approving a much needed $60 billion US military aid package to Ukraine
*06:33.940- 06:37.040* :  was already having an effect on the country's war effort.
*06:37.040- 06:43.100* :  Mr Stoltenberg confirmed that some allies were aiming to provide Ukraine with a million drones.
*06:43.180- 06:50.720* :  So far, seven NATO members, plus Sweden, have said they'll join the group led by Latvia and Britain.
*06:51.360- 06:55.520* :  Our defence correspondent Jonathan Bill reports from the NATO meeting in Brussels.
*06:56.420- 07:01.160* :  In background briefings, NATO officials admit that Ukrainian commanders on the ground
*07:01.260- 07:06.620* :  are now having to make very tough decisions because of shortages of ammunition.
*07:07.600- 07:13.380* :  One senior official admitted there were worries in Ukraine about running out, not just of artillery
*07:13.380- 07:16.080* :  shells, but also air defence munitions.
*07:16.980- 07:23.260* :  That's why the head of NATO said it was so important that the US Congress approves President
*07:23.260- 07:25.220* :  Biden's package of military aid.
*07:25.800- 07:30.360* :  It has been passed by the Senate, but not yet, the House of Representatives.
*07:31.320- 07:37.200* :  Jens Stoltenberg may clear the delay was already hurting Ukraine, and he said he expected
*07:37.200- 07:39.440* :  Congress to break the impasse.
*07:39.600- 07:44.820* :  The fact that the US has not been able to make a decision so far has already had consequences.
*07:44.940- 07:48.260* :  It is impacting the flow of support.
*07:48.260- 07:54.560* :  To some extent this can be compensated by increased support from other allies, and European
*07:54.560- 08:00.120* :  allies and Canada are stepping up, but the United States being by far the biggest ally,
*08:00.540- 08:03.060* :  of course it's vital that continue to provide support.
*08:03.060- 08:06.680* :  There have been pledges of more military support at this meeting in Brussels.
*08:07.300- 08:12.580* :  Britain said it would lead a coalition which aimed to deliver thousands of drones to Ukraine.
*08:13.480- 08:18.780* :  But it's America that's been leading this effort, and its internal politics is not just
*08:18.780- 08:25.040* :  hurting Ukraine, but also raising wider questions about America's relationship with NATO.
*08:25.780- 08:31.180* :  Not least because Donald Trump has, once again, appeared to doubt its very purpose that
*08:31.180- 08:35.040* :  an attack on one ally would prompt a response from all.
*08:35.520- 08:36.940* :  Jonathan Bill in Brussels.
*08:37.440- 08:42.000* :  The White House has confirmed it believes that Russia is developing a new anti-satellite
*08:42.000- 08:45.000* :  weapon, saying it's closely monitoring the situation.
*08:45.560- 08:50.580* :  There's been widespread speculation in US news media about the alleged threat after
*08:50.580- 08:54.560* :  a cryptic social media post from a member of Congress on Wednesday.
*08:54.900- 08:57.720* :  From Washington, here's our correspondent, John Sarwarath.
*08:58.400- 09:02.740* :  The White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said the US has known for many
*09:02.740- 09:07.440* :  months that Russia is trying to develop a new anti-satellite weapon, adding that it
*09:07.440- 09:09.840* :  was being taken very, very seriously.
*09:10.580- 09:14.440* :  It first came to light in a social media post from the chairman of the House Intelligence
*09:14.440- 09:19.240* :  Committee, Republican Representative Mike Turner, in which he spoke of a serious threat
*09:19.240- 09:22.360* :  and called on President Joe Biden to declassify it.
*09:22.900- 09:26.820* :  US news reports, quoting unnamed officials, have since claimed that it relates to the
*09:26.820- 09:31.980* :  deployment of a space-based nuclear weapon, which would use radiation to knock out satellites,
*09:32.480- 09:35.700* :  a detail neither confirmed nor denied by Mr Kirby.
*09:36.240- 09:38.600* :  He stressed that the weapon was still under development.
*09:39.600- 09:44.120* :  And denied a Russian claim that the reports were a deliberate ploy to pressure Congress
*09:44.120- 09:46.120* :  to approve aid to Ukraine.
*09:46.760- 09:52.160* :  John Sarwarath, well, let's hear more of Mr Kirby's views on what the Russians are developing.
*09:52.800- 09:56.580* :  This is not an active capability that's been deployed, and though Russia's pursuit
*09:56.580- 10:01.120* :  of this particular capability is troubling, there is no immediate threat to anyone's
*10:01.320- 10:01.600* :  safety.
*10:01.980- 10:06.240* :  We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical
*10:06.240- 10:08.060* :  destruction here on Earth.
*10:08.340- 10:12.900* :  That said, we've been closely monitoring this Russian activity, and we will continue
*10:12.900- 10:14.080* :  to take it very seriously.
*10:14.300- 10:19.560* :  Diana's use is a research analyst for a space security at the Royal United Services
*10:20.220- 10:21.400* :  Institute here in London.
*10:21.920- 10:26.740* :  She also hosts the podcast War in Space, and she's been speaking to Johnny Diamond.
*10:27.420- 10:32.580* :  What we think that this satellite specifically might be, it's research dating back to 2019,
*10:33.280- 10:37.540* :  is that the Russians are looking to develop a nuclear reactor that could be used for
*10:37.540- 10:42.460* :  jammers in orbit, so that would be a satellite used for electronic warfare to disrupt other
*10:42.460- 10:43.320* :  satellite signals.
*10:43.780- 10:49.980* :  So battles breaking out in space with nuclear weapons, flying hither and thither, you think
*10:49.980- 10:50.720* :  that is unrealistic.
*10:51.280- 10:56.620* :  If we talk about red lines, just a conventional kinetic attack is a red line in space, and
*10:56.620- 11:01.360* :  a sort of nuclear detonation in space is another couple of degrees further from that.
*11:01.360- 11:08.000* :  So it would be entirely unprecedented, and we mustn't forget nuclear detonations are indiscriminate.
*11:08.180- 11:12.520* :  So this would wreak havoc on orbits, but also all other satellites around.
*11:12.520- 11:16.180* :  So it would also have huge implications for the attacker themselves.
*11:16.420- 11:19.080* :  This is why I think it's on the left-light side.
*11:19.080- 11:25.320* :  If we do end up with a Russian nuclear power satellite with jamming capabilities, I mean,
*11:25.440- 11:28.720* :  presumably the other side would want to respond.
*11:28.880- 11:32.980* :  Does one side have more to lose than the other when it comes to satellite capabilities?
*11:33.600- 11:34.160* :  Yes, absolutely.
*11:34.180- 11:38.000* :  So the West is very reliant on space for its military capabilities.
*11:38.740- 11:43.200* :  Russia has less to lose in space, that's partly because their space industry has suffered
*11:43.200- 11:48.240* :  massively, specifically because of sanctions that have obviously been in place since 2014,
*11:48.240- 11:51.200* :  but in general, the space industry is not in a good spot.
*11:51.720- 11:56.040* :  And as a result, their space capability are definitely lagging behind that of the West.
*11:56.380- 11:58.980* :  Therefore, I would argue Russia has less to lose in space.
*11:59.060- 12:02.880* :  On the other hand, a large-scale destruction would not benefit anybody.
*12:03.440- 12:06.060* :  Julianna's use, speaking, to Johnny Diamond.
*12:07.060- 12:12.040* :  Donald Trump is about to become the first former U.S. president to stand trial on criminal
*12:12.040- 12:12.680* :  charges.
*12:13.180- 12:18.840* :  A judge in New York has ruled the trial on his Hush Money case will start on the 25th of March.
*12:19.460- 12:24.740* :  In the case, Mr. Trump is accused of misreporting payments to the porn actress Stormy Daniels
*12:25.040- 12:30.100* :  in exchange for her silence over their affair in the run-up to the 2016 election.
*12:30.780- 12:35.740* :  Mr. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and as he left the court in Manhattan, the former president
*12:35.740- 12:38.200* :  said the case was politically motivated.
*12:38.860- 12:44.820* :  Instead of being in South Carolina and other states campaigning, I'm stuck here to an
*12:44.820- 12:46.320* :  election interference case.
*12:46.720- 12:48.940* :  Nobody has ever seen anything like it in this country.
*12:48.940- 12:49.680* :  It's a disgrace.
*12:50.600- 12:52.300* :  We'll just have to figure it out.
*12:53.040- 12:55.700* :  I'll be here during the day, and I'll be campaigning during the night.
*12:56.440- 12:58.880* :  A bite should be doing the same thing, but I'll be sleeping.
*12:59.380- 13:02.700* :  This is all from the DOJ, this all comes out of Washington.
*13:03.760- 13:09.220* :  Well, it's not illegal in the U.S. to pay someone compensation in exchange for a non-disclosure
*13:09.220- 13:09.660* :  agreement.
*13:10.220- 13:15.040* :  I asked our correspondent to New York Ned Atophic, what is the prosecution's case?
*13:15.840- 13:21.680* :  What of these 34 felony counts really stem from is what prosecutors' alleged was falsifying
*13:21.680- 13:22.680* :  business records.
*13:22.680- 13:29.180* :  They say that Donald Trump in reimbursing his fixer Michael Cohen, who paid Stormy Daniels
*13:29.180- 13:36.620* :  the former porn star $130,000, that was actually recorded as legal fees that they didn't come
*13:36.620- 13:39.940* :  forward and say that they were for campaign contributions.
*13:40.020- 13:44.520* :  So prosecutors alleged that this was to help his campaign to hide the fact that there
*13:44.520- 13:45.200* :  wasn't a fair.
*13:45.200- 13:50.120* :  It's interesting because Donald Trump and his lawyers argue that these aren't felonies.
*13:50.120- 13:54.840* :  He says there is no crime, but we'll have to see what the jury decides in this case,
*13:54.840- 13:57.300* :  which we now know will start March 25th.
*13:57.400- 14:01.340* :  Mr. Trump has believed it's not guilty to all charges, but what sentences could he face
*14:01.360- 14:02.100* :  if found guilty?
*14:02.460- 14:07.880* :  I mean, look, he could theoretically face up to four years in prison, but what we've heard
*14:07.880- 14:13.900* :  from legal experts is that's highly unlikely here, particularly now that this would be the
*14:13.900- 14:15.920* :  first criminal trial he faces.
*14:15.980- 14:19.080* :  We've certainly seen him in New York and in court for civil cases.
*14:19.480- 14:23.600* :  Those claims that this is all election interference now kind of common from those appearances in
*14:23.600- 14:23.940* :  New York.
*14:24.340- 14:25.780* :  But this would be the first criminal case.
*14:26.140- 14:30.660* :  So if he is indeed convicted, it would amount to kind of his first offenses.
*14:30.660- 14:32.740* :  So jail time is really unlikely here.
*14:32.740- 14:37.240* :  What legal experts suggest is he could just face fines in this case, if anything.
*14:37.500- 14:40.460* :  Well, there was another case involving him in Georgia today.
*14:40.460- 14:42.120* :  It wasn't.
*14:42.500- 14:43.120* :  What happened there?
*14:43.120- 14:47.540* :  That's a really interesting hearing because it's actually almost attached to his case,
*14:47.540- 14:48.240* :  but separate.
*14:48.400- 14:53.620* :  Now Donald Trump, of course, in Georgia is accused by prosecutors from Fulton County of
*14:53.620- 14:57.200* :  trying to overturn Joe Biden's win in that state.
*14:57.320- 15:00.980* :  They show the phone call with the Secretary of State, for example, where he's asked to find
*15:00.980- 15:02.540* :  11,000 votes in his favor.
*15:02.780- 15:07.720* :  The hearing was actually about the district attorney herself and whether she had an improper
*15:07.720- 15:12.180* :  romantic relationship with the case's top prosecutor, Nathan Wade.
*15:12.180- 15:16.340* :  So they're hearing evidence about when that relationship began and if it has any impact
*15:16.340- 15:18.700* :  to the point where they need to take her off the case.
*15:19.400- 15:21.140* :  She had a topic in New York.
*15:21.660- 15:25.540* :  And now to a sound we feel we must apologize for in advance.
*15:30.780- 15:37.060* :  Allegations of a child crying for an entire 29 hour flight have lit up the internet.
*15:37.180- 15:43.400* :  After one man's TikTok went viral, hitting 14 and a half million views and sparking
*15:43.400- 15:46.920* :  a furious debate as Stephanie Prentice now reports.
*15:47.780- 15:50.240* :  Meet my 29-hour flight to Berlin.
*15:52.500- 15:57.980* :  The video, a man staring into the camera close up, one eye twitching.
*15:59.160- 16:05.020* :  The scene, what he calls a 29-hour flight from New Zealand to Berlin.
*16:05.920- 16:07.640* :  The soundtrack, this.
*16:09.400- 16:14.260* :  Musician Henry Beesley's viral video cuts through different close-ups of him responding
*16:14.260- 16:19.680* :  to what he says was non-stop crying using captions to rate each one.
*16:20.380- 16:32.020* :  This for example is described as a nice long one here and this is titled Kettlesboiled.
*16:32.700- 16:39.140* :  Many of the 2.8 million people who liked the video are using the comment section to emphatically
*16:39.140- 16:41.060* :  call for child-free flights.
*16:41.720- 16:45.160* :  Most of others have sympathized with the parent's plight.
*16:57.060- 17:02.100* :  Some have even dug up an old video of a man on a southwest airline having a meltdown
*17:02.100- 17:04.600* :  of his own over a crying baby.
*17:10.980- 17:15.920* :  His shoulder-time passengers banded together to sing to an inconsolable toddler.
*17:23.560- 17:29.060* :  As for Henry Beesley, despite his suffering, the video ends on a happy note with a final
*17:29.060- 17:32.840* :  rating on the screen saying, incredible stamina, 10 out of 10.
*17:34.060- 17:36.900* :  The joys of flying, Stephanie Prentice reporting.
*17:39.720- 17:44.400* :  Still to come on the global news podcast, Manchester United, break the record for the most
*17:44.400- 17:46.800* :  expensive football team in history.
*17:47.240- 17:52.840* :  This figure doesn't include Rasmus Hoyland, Mason Mount or Andreanana all signed during
*17:52.840- 17:54.880* :  the transfer window ahead of this season.
*17:55.020- 17:58.980* :  Their squad has actually increased in value, some would argue maybe possibly not in quality.
*18:07.080- 18:12.500* :  Van Gogh's Constitutional Council has ruled that the postponement of presidential elections
*18:12.500- 18:15.600* :  scheduled for later this month is unlawful.
*18:16.160- 18:20.900* :  Last week, President Mackie Sal announced he was delaying the elections due to disputes
*18:21.060- 18:24.080* :  over the eligibility of some opposition candidates.
*18:24.680- 18:29.300* :  The decision has led to street protests in one of Africa's most stable democracies.
*18:29.840- 18:32.860* :  Our West Africa correspondent, Mayany Jones, has more.
*18:33.440- 18:38.260* :  Van Gogh's Constitutional Council ensures that any laws passed are in line with the
*18:38.260- 18:38.900* :  Constitution.
*18:39.460- 18:43.040* :  Therefore, the fact that it says that pushing back this month's presidential elections
*18:43.040- 18:47.180* :  to December is unlawful, is a big blow to President Mackie Sal.
*18:47.180- 18:52.380* :  It's not clear what Mr. Sal will do next, but his opponents will see this latest decision
*18:52.780- 18:53.440* :  as vindication.
*18:54.180- 18:56.400* :  There's been stronger position to delay in Senegal.
*18:56.880- 19:01.000* :  Protesters have taken to the streets, and opposition candidates and lawmakers have filed
*19:01.000- 19:02.900* :  a number of legal challenges against it.
*19:03.480- 19:08.180* :  The politics of President Sal accused him of launching an institutional coup, strong
*19:08.220- 19:12.120* :  words in a region that has been rocked by a number of military takeovers in the past four
*19:12.120- 19:12.580* :  years.
*19:13.100- 19:16.120* :  Senegal has never had a coup, unlike all of its neighbours.
*19:16.660- 19:20.320* :  Regional bodies and Western powers have expressed concerns at the delay of the polls.
*19:21.180- 19:21.940* :  Mayany Jones.
*19:29.540- 19:29.580* :  In Greece.
*19:29.720- 19:34.860* :  Celebrations outside Parliament in Athens on Thursday evening, as Greece became the
*19:34.860- 19:39.800* :  first Christian orthodox majority country to legalize same-sex marriage.
*19:40.380- 19:44.240* :  The bill was introduced by the Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis.
*19:44.980- 19:45.880* :  Ishimere Nimera.
*19:46.520- 19:51.300* :  Today is a day of joy, because from tomorrow, one more barrier between us will be lifted,
*19:51.840- 19:56.080* :  and it will become a bridge of coexistence, in a free society with free citizens.
*19:56.740- 20:00.940* :  A southern Europe correspondent Mark Lohan told me more about how the vote went.
*20:01.660- 20:09.660* :  Well, 176 MPs voted in favour, about 76 voted against, but there were about 46 MPs who
*20:09.960- 20:11.720* :  marked themselves as absent from the chamber.
*20:11.720- 20:18.320* :  Now, those are likely to be MPs from the governing party of Kiriakos Mitsotakis, who basically
*20:18.320- 20:23.720* :  ducked the vote in order to in effect a register their disapproval without having to vote against
*20:23.780- 20:24.100* :  it.
*20:24.500- 20:29.880* :  He didn't have the support of the whole of his party behind him, but he had enough opposition
*20:29.880- 20:33.220* :  MPs to vote with him in order to get the vote through.
*20:34.000- 20:35.140* :  He's in a very strong position.
*20:35.380- 20:37.820* :  He stormed to re-election recently.
*20:37.820- 20:43.200* :  He has managed to pass now a bill which traditionally is something that would be associated with
*20:43.220- 20:47.460* :  then-to-left government, same-sex marriage, but he's a centre-right Prime Minister who
*20:47.460- 20:51.440* :  feels that it is time for Greece to fall in line with much of the European Union.
*20:51.440- 20:54.500* :  18 EU countries already allow same-sex marriage.
*20:54.500- 20:58.860* :  Greece will now be the 16th and it will be the first orthodox majority country and the
*20:58.860- 21:01.540* :  first country in Southeast Europe to allow it.
*21:01.700- 21:07.820* :  What about reaction across Greek society and particularly from the orthodox church in
*21:07.820- 21:09.680* :  the country, which opposed this, didn't it?
*21:10.000- 21:10.940* :  Very vehemently so.
*21:10.940- 21:15.860* :  I mean, some bishops said that they would not baptise the children of same-sex families
*21:16.400- 21:18.820* :  in order to teach them about as they put it the sin.
*21:19.480- 21:23.880* :  They read out their condemnation of the move in church services across the country earlier
*21:23.880- 21:29.800* :  in the month, and polls before the vote was passed showed that society was pretty
*21:29.800- 21:33.120* :  evenly split for and against a slight majority in favour of the bill.
*21:33.820- 21:38.980* :  So I think this marks a rare moment in which Greece's politicians have stood up to the
*21:38.980- 21:42.600* :  orthodox church, which is still very powerful, and it is a moment when the Greek government
*21:42.600- 21:46.440* :  has decided that this was the way forward and they have to now drag society with the law.
*21:48.560- 21:54.440* :  Japan has unexpectedly fallen into a recession after its economy shrank for two quarters
*21:54.440- 21:55.020* :  in a row.
*21:55.480- 22:00.400* :  Market watchers had expected the new data to reveal positive growth rather than another
*22:00.400- 22:02.080* :  quarter of declining output.
*22:02.720- 22:06.000* :  Japanese households have been struggling to keep heads above water.
*22:06.800- 22:11.540* :  When everybody, of course, it's regrettable, I don't like thinking that Japan will gradually
*22:12.200- 22:12.220* :  decline.
*22:14.180- 22:17.840* :  My summary, it works gone down, so I've stopped going out to buy clothes and eating
*22:17.840- 22:19.260* :  out in order to save money.
*22:20.980- 22:25.540* :  The recession and weakness of the year and against the dollar suggests Japan has now
*22:25.540- 22:29.340* :  fallen behind Germany as the world's third largest economy.
*22:29.780- 22:30.820* :  So what's gone wrong?
*22:31.240- 22:35.880* :  Peter Landers, the Tokyo bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal, explained to San
*22:35.880- 22:36.380* :  Fennec.
*22:36.960- 22:41.380* :  Consumer spending in Japan continues to be weak largely because wages are going up,
*22:41.380- 22:45.800* :  but they're being outpaced by inflation and that tends to encourage people to be cautious
*22:45.800- 22:46.480* :  about spending.
*22:46.620- 22:50.720* :  The weekend should help exports and in fact has helped exports from Japan because it makes
*22:50.720- 22:54.960* :  these Japanese made products more competitive in dollar terms, Japanese workers are making
*22:54.960- 22:56.300* :  a lot less than they used to.
*22:56.400- 23:00.900* :  The weak currency means that Japanese people are paying more for imports like oil or food.
*23:00.900- 23:04.740* :  That's taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks and leaving less for other purchases.
*23:04.980- 23:09.300* :  Consumer spending in general is not particularly strong when you take inflation into accounts.
*23:09.620- 23:12.520* :  Do you think it's a blit or do you think that this is a trend?
*23:12.960- 23:13.920* :  I think this is a blip.
*23:14.020- 23:18.400* :  It may be technically a recession by one definition, but it doesn't mean that's we're in a great
*23:18.400- 23:19.460* :  depression here by any means.
*23:19.460- 23:21.360* :  I think the economy is just roughly flat.
*23:21.520- 23:24.780* :  Tell us what's happening on the stock market because I think that shows a different picture
*23:24.780- 23:25.280* :  doesn't it?
*23:25.400- 23:30.220* :  It really does form a contrast to see wages are going down still in Japan, whereas the stock
*23:30.260- 23:31.480* :  market is going way up.
*23:31.540- 23:34.780* :  I think in the last two or four months you've seen it go up by more than 20%.
*23:35.120- 23:40.440* :  Only driven by foreign investors who are encouraged by what they see in corporate Japan and corporate
*23:40.440- 23:42.040* :  profits are up strongly.
*23:42.240- 23:46.340* :  You do have companies making more money, especially those that are taking advantage of the
*23:46.500- 23:48.860* :  weekend to export more high tech industries.
*23:48.940- 23:52.580* :  There seems to be expected boom and semiconductors are artificial intelligence.
*23:52.940- 23:57.280* :  Foreign stock investors are very excited about the potential for Japanese companies, but
*23:57.280- 24:00.380* :  you don't see that excitement in the consumer spending figures.
*24:00.600- 24:04.420* :  What needs to happen do you think to get those consumers spending again?
*24:04.780- 24:09.280* :  We do see a lot of companies talking about big wages increases starting last year, retailing
*24:09.280- 24:13.060* :  the parent of Uniqlo said it might raise wages as much as 40%.
*24:13.100- 24:18.220* :  Other companies like Santori talking about 7% wage increases, which if carried out would
*24:18.220- 24:21.160* :  certainly exceed the inflation rate in Japan.
*24:21.160- 24:24.800* :  In the next month or two, we're going to get a lot of information about how companies
*24:24.800- 24:29.340* :  are raising wages and whether those raises are enough to exceed inflation.
*24:29.440- 24:33.160* :  If that happens, I think you'll see people saying now I can spend a little bit more and
*24:33.160- 24:35.540* :  you'll see much healthier overall growth figures.
*24:35.920- 24:38.400* :  Peter Landers talking there to Sam Fennec.
*24:38.700- 24:43.020* :  Well another one of the world's richest economies has also gone into recession and that's
*24:43.020- 24:45.360* :  the UK as Dashini David reports.
*24:46.260- 24:51.720* :  Be it manufacturing, construction or retail, all the major sectors fed worse than expected
*24:51.720- 24:57.520* :  at the end of 2023, as higher inflation and interest rates took their toll on finances
*24:57.560- 24:58.580* :  and spending.
*24:59.080- 25:04.160* :  Two consecutive quarters of falling output were sufficient for many economists to claim
*25:04.160- 25:08.640* :  a recession, but the economy was effectively flatlining ahead of that.
*25:08.640- 25:15.580* :  The typical person was the equivalent of £140 worth off by the end of 2023 than they were
*25:15.580- 25:17.500* :  at the start of 2022.
*25:18.100- 25:21.080* :  For many, like these shoppers in Essex, it's been painful.
*25:21.340- 25:25.180* :  We've never got any money, go out, everything's expensive now.
*25:25.520- 25:32.440* :  We really feel the increase of the costs of the food and everything, even when we went
*25:32.500- 25:33.560* :  to the food bank.
*25:33.740- 25:37.640* :  Yeah, I am very worried about spending, especially when it comes to things like electricity and gas,
*25:38.140- 25:39.220* :  diesel and petrol.
*25:39.220- 25:44.400* :  The Chancellor, Jomi Hunt, acknowledged it had been a challenging environment, but said
*25:44.400- 25:47.560* :  he was optimistic the dip may have been short-lived.
*25:47.640- 25:54.660* :  The turning point will come when inflation falls to its target level of 2% and the Bank
*25:54.660- 25:57.320* :  of England feels it can bring down interest rates.
*25:57.380- 26:03.340* :  The jobs market remains resilient and wage growth is on average outpacing inflation, but
*26:03.340- 26:06.540* :  over a million households are set to remorgage this year.
*26:06.820- 26:09.460* :  Their debt repayments will be higher than they have been.
*26:09.880- 26:14.640* :  So, across the economy as a whole, the pace of improvement could be modest.
*26:15.340- 26:16.160* :  Thus, Shini David.
*26:17.020- 26:22.020* :  Fresh computer modeling indicates that up to half of the critical Amazon forest cover
*26:22.400- 26:25.700* :  could be pushed into an irreversible collapse by 2050.
*26:26.240- 26:30.800* :  The research, published in the journal Nature, is said to be the most comprehensive analysis
*26:30.800- 26:35.100* :  yet of the threat faced by the world's largest tropical rainforest.
*26:35.860- 26:37.700* :  It warns of dark consequences.
*26:38.340- 26:43.660* :  Henna Handel is a climate and policy researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine, and she's
*26:43.660- 26:45.460* :  been speaking to Victoria Oonhunda.
*26:46.120- 26:49.660* :  You know, when we talk about the Amazon rainforest, I think we need to remember that this is
*26:49.660- 26:51.780* :  the world's largest tropical rainforest.
*26:51.780- 26:55.060* :  It's home to one in 10 known species on the planet.
*26:55.680- 27:00.220* :  And so, what this type of a study showed us is that ecosystems like these are resilient,
*27:00.220- 27:02.840* :  but they also need to be Captain Adelecate balance.
*27:02.900- 27:08.960* :  And the study mentioned four key factors – droughts, fires, deforestation, and rising
*27:08.960- 27:12.060* :  temperatures that are really overburdening the Amazon.
*27:12.520- 27:16.620* :  And that's why I think it's so critical that we ramp up all efforts to protect this
*27:16.620- 27:21.520* :  precious, precious ecosystem because millions of people in Brazil rely on it and the world
*27:21.520- 27:24.220* :  relies on it for its stabilizing effects on our climate.
*27:24.500- 27:27.960* :  And how does this forest decline affect the rest of the planet?
*27:28.540- 27:32.940* :  So the Amazon is actually really critical for its cooling effect that is important for
*27:32.940- 27:33.460* :  the globe.
*27:33.460- 27:39.000* :  It also functions as a carbon sink, storing more than 120 billion tons of carbon.
*27:39.560- 27:42.380* :  And right now, you're seeing so many different disruptions to the Amazon.
*27:42.380- 27:47.200* :  You're seeing lots of deforestation and diminished rainfall happening, particularly between
*27:47.200- 27:48.000* :  June and November.
*27:48.500- 27:50.460* :  So it's a devastating picture all around.
*27:50.460- 27:54.780* :  And just recently, there were some droughts that were really destructive to the local population.
*27:54.960- 28:00.080* :  Actually, the state of Amazonas had to declare a state of emergency and deliver food, water,
*28:00.080- 28:02.100* :  and essential supplies to local communities.
*28:02.100- 28:07.200* :  So a lot of people locally rely on the Amazon for its resources, but globally, certainly,
*28:07.200- 28:09.740* :  it has very important climactic consequences.
*28:10.600- 28:12.520* :  Hannah, is it just all doom and gloom?
*28:12.520- 28:15.060* :  Or is there a ray of hope somewhere here?
*28:15.440- 28:18.880* :  I think the ray of hope resides in international collaboration.
*28:19.480- 28:24.280* :  And what we saw at the United Nations Climate Change Conference last year, COP28, we saw
*28:24.280- 28:29.280* :  Brazil's President Lula, Colombia's President Petro, and Honduras' President Castro,
*28:29.280- 28:33.860* :  along with other leaders in Central and South America, really come together and talk about
*28:33.860- 28:39.100* :  the need for climate justice, the need for the so-called global north to support the
*28:39.100- 28:43.440* :  global south and their climate efforts in order to prevent catastrophes, like what
*28:43.440- 28:45.480* :  we're potentially witnessing happen to the Amazon.
*28:45.480- 28:48.320* :  I think we need to look toward that arm for international collaboration.
*28:49.000- 28:54.440* :  Hannah Handel, a specialist in how to contain the effects of climate disasters at the Stanford
*28:54.440- 28:56.680* :  School of Medicine in the United States.
*28:57.820- 29:02.800* :  New figures have revealed that last season's Manchester United Squad cost a combined total
*29:03.120- 29:05.160* :  of $1.5 billion.
*29:06.040- 29:08.600* :  That's the most money ever spent on a football team.
*29:09.060- 29:12.320* :  Despite this, United has struggled for footballing success.
*29:13.000- 29:18.220* :  Rachel Wright asked football expert Nigel Adely what they've spent all this money on.
*29:18.960- 29:25.420* :  They sign players such as Anthony, Harry McWire, Jaden Sancio and Casimiro all for fees close
*29:25.420- 29:28.040* :  to $100 million individually.
*29:28.780- 29:34.500* :  And this figure doesn't include players such as Rasmus, Hoyland, Mason, Mount or Andreanana
*29:34.520- 29:37.700* :  all signed during the transfer window ahead of this season.
*29:37.920- 29:42.040* :  So their squad has actually increased in value, although some would argue maybe possibly
*29:42.040- 29:42.860* :  not in quality.
*29:43.160- 29:46.580* :  Has this money been well spent then and does it breach any rules?
*29:46.580- 29:52.400* :  Well, in terms of financial fair play, Manchester United has such a global brand with such
*29:52.400- 29:57.640* :  a huge turnover that even though they do have the most expensive squad ever assembled,
*29:57.640- 30:02.360* :  they are still within financial fair play because wherever you go in the world, you can
*30:02.360- 30:07.100* :  find someone wearing a Manchester United shirt, those shirts all generate money and they
*30:07.100- 30:11.320* :  also have sponsorship deals with various companies in different parts of the world.
*30:11.320- 30:14.600* :  So they have the money to spend, but have they spent it well?
*30:14.600- 30:19.480* :  That is another question because Manchester United have not won the Premier League since
*30:20.320- 30:20.340* :  2013.
*30:20.720- 30:24.840* :  They've since been overtaken by a number of clubs, including their neighbours Manchester
*30:24.840- 30:25.240* :  City.
*30:25.780- 30:30.120* :  There has been an accusation towards Manchester United over many years now that they are
*30:30.120- 30:34.520* :  signing players, possibly for the value they can bring to the market for the number of
*30:34.520- 30:38.500* :  shirts they can sell and they tend to sign players and then think about how they will fit
*30:38.500- 30:42.360* :  into the team and really to be a successful club in the long term, it should be the other
*30:42.360- 30:42.880* :  way around.
*30:43.280- 30:47.100* :  Of course, Manchester United aren't the only massive spenders are there.
*30:47.100- 30:50.880* :  You mentioned Manchester City and there's plenty more in the Premier League.
*30:51.680- 30:56.660* :  Yes, Manchester City and Chelsea both have squads, which have cost way in excess of
*30:56.660- 31:02.540* :  one billion dollars, but Manchester City do have a very established squad now and they
*31:02.540- 31:07.060* :  are very clever in the way they recruit their players, Irling Harland, their main striker
*31:07.060- 31:13.380* :  was Simon Borussia Dortmund, but only for a fee of around $75 million, which seems
*31:13.380- 31:18.180* :  a bit of a bargain because they often exploit the opportunity to sign players with release
*31:18.180- 31:19.960* :  clauses in their contract.
*31:19.960- 31:24.620* :  So although Manchester City have the best team, it's been acquired over a number of years
*31:24.620- 31:29.100* :  and unlike Manchester United currently, they are not trying to play catch up, but interestingly,
*31:29.300- 31:34.740* :  the figures you wafer have released today does not include the billion dollars that Chelsea
*31:34.740- 31:39.720* :  have spent on their squad over the past 12 months since they were taken over by the American
*31:39.720- 31:41.100* :  billionaire Todd Bowley.
*31:41.100- 31:46.400* :  So Chelsea could very soon have the most expensive reassembled squad ever and with a similar
*31:46.400- 31:47.500* :  lack of current success.
*31:48.200- 31:51.580* :  Football expert Nigel Adelie speaking there to Rachel Wright.
*31:52.120- 31:57.740* :  And finally London's famous tube map is getting a makeover with the introduction of new names
*31:57.740- 32:00.260* :  and colours for its six overground lines.
*32:00.900- 32:06.080* :  Until now they've been marked by a series of orange lines, but each will now be rebranded
*32:06.280- 32:10.420* :  to make the network more accessible and to pay tribute to the capital's history.
*32:10.880- 32:12.780* :  With more details, here's Graeme Satchel.
*32:13.560- 32:17.440* :  Dreams, happy carp reality at Wembley.
*32:18.120- 32:23.400* :  The moment in 2022 when England's women won the Euros at Wembley, the overground service
*32:23.400- 32:28.660* :  that runs through Wembley is now being renamed and will be called the Lioness Line.
*32:29.080- 32:33.460* :  Other parts of the overground network are also getting new names to celebrate London's
*32:33.500- 32:34.580* :  culture and history.
*32:34.720- 32:38.680* :  This specially woven bathing suit is the very latest for the beach and has marvellous
*32:38.680- 32:40.060* :  sea and sun-resisting properties.
*32:40.240- 32:40.920* :  What's it made of?
*32:41.280- 32:41.540* :  Wool.
*32:41.940- 32:46.680* :  The Weaver Line runs through parts of the capital associated with the textile trade.
*32:46.980- 32:49.560* :  London is the best for me.
*32:49.920- 32:55.300* :  The Windrush Line passes through areas with strong ties to Caribbean communities, including
*32:55.300- 32:57.880* :  Dolston Junction, Peck and Rye and West Croydon.
*32:58.500- 33:03.760* :  The struggle for women's rights and its connection to the East End is the inspiration for the
*33:03.760- 33:04.780* :  Suffragett Line.
*33:05.280- 33:10.420* :  Emma Strain from Transport for London says the names were chosen after extensive consultation.
*33:10.640- 33:16.000* :  We spoke to customers, historians, industry experts, community groups, lots of names came
*33:16.000- 33:16.200* :  up.
*33:16.540- 33:19.540* :  We discovered lots of things and stories about London and then we looked at all of those
*33:19.540- 33:22.500* :  and thought actually how do we represent London's communities and London's stories.
*33:23.000- 33:28.240* :  The overground network is hugely popular with 180 million passengers using it a year.
*33:28.660- 33:33.300* :  On the current map it is a slightly confusing orange spaghetti of lines.
*33:33.940- 33:38.400* :  Transport for London says the rebrand will make it easier for passengers to get around.
*33:42.020- 33:45.520* :  And that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*33:45.520- 33:46.020* :  later.
*33:46.380- 33:49.840* :  This edition was mixed by Abby Wiltshire, the producer, was Emma Joseph.

*34:14.200- 34:14.600* :  president.
*34:15.000- 34:19.700* :  Kenny followed through on his promises to slash government and tame inflation and do
