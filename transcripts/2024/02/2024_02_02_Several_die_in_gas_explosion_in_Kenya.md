*00:38.320- 00:45.520* :  BBC World Service. I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 2nd of February, these are our
*00:45.520- 00:50.760* :  main stories. Several people have been killed and hundreds more injured in a massive gas explosion
*00:50.760- 00:57.100* :  in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. A Malaysian Prime Minister who was jailed for his part in a multi-billion
*00:57.100- 01:04.540* :  dollar financial scandal has had his 12 year prison sentence hard. Also in this podcast,
*01:04.540- 01:09.860* :  as Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv comes under renewed attack by Russian missiles,
*01:09.860- 01:15.680* :  we meet the people living and learning underground. Running alongside the platform on the metro,
*01:15.680- 01:24.960* :  there's a corridor of classrooms here and the sirens wail for an air raid. No one has to move.
*01:25.600- 01:30.240* :  Later on we hear how strike action is causing severe disruption to public transport in Germany
*01:30.740- 01:33.960* :  and we hear a tale of suspected avian espionage.
*01:37.300- 01:42.580* :  We begin this podcast in Kenya where a series of gas explosions in Nairobi have killed at least
*01:42.580- 01:49.280* :  three people and injured nearly 300. A large area has been turned into a charred landscape.
*01:49.280- 01:56.380* :  Officials say hundreds of liquefied petroleum gas or LPG canisters had gone up in flames, igniting
*01:56.380- 02:03.840* :  a huge ball of fire. This man is one of the injured. I got burned by an exploding gas canister
*02:04.260- 02:09.420* :  as I was trying to escape. It exploded right in front of me and the impact knocked me down
*02:09.720- 02:13.600* :  and the flames engulfed me. I'm lucky that I was strong enough to get away.
*02:14.600- 02:19.420* :  Ansoy is our senior Africa correspondent. She is at the site of the explosion in
*02:19.420- 02:24.820* :  Embakassi in the southeast in part of Nairobi. People have gathered here just trying to
*02:25.160- 02:31.220* :  understand what exactly happened. I'm standing near the gate of the area where the explosion started.
*02:31.220- 02:36.800* :  I haunted at least 10 lorries there. We're told that the lorry that explored it had
*02:37.280- 02:43.120* :  LPG gas and the amount of damage in the area is a compound of about half an acre that's
*02:43.220- 02:50.060* :  completely burned, all the vehicles they are burned. On the other side of the road about 50 to 100 meters
*02:50.060- 02:55.720* :  away, I can see a block of flats that the facade was destroyed. I can see on the rooftop
*02:55.720- 03:01.740* :  black metal protruding. I'm told it's part of a car that was blown there. Things were flying
*03:01.740- 03:08.140* :  in the air, gas cylinders, metal parts, including a shipping container. So people here are in shock.
*03:08.800- 03:13.940* :  I have just met a one woman who had come here to look for her friend. She's walked into the house.
*03:13.940- 03:19.480* :  It's completely burned and she's wondering what happened to her friend who was pregnant and had
*03:19.480- 03:25.720* :  a child. Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross, is following developments. I think given
*03:26.240- 03:32.540* :  sort of the scale of the explosion and the speed at which the fire moved towards the blocks of
*03:32.540- 03:38.880* :  flats, it's somewhat lucky I think that more lives weren't lost and people did manage to get
*03:38.880- 03:43.720* :  out pretty fast. Although there are a lot of people being treated in hospital and we understand
*03:43.720- 03:50.220* :  it took about nine hours for the fire services to put out the blaze because it had spread
*03:50.220- 03:56.000* :  over quite a large area. Indeed. Well, do we have an explanation as to what caused this initial
*03:56.000- 04:04.940* :  explosion? Well, we were told by officials that a lorry that was carrying gas exploded inside
*04:05.260- 04:12.600* :  this facility. We understand that gas cylinders are filled at that place. But of course,
*04:12.600- 04:19.380* :  there are lots of questions going on about why this facility was there, you know, in a densely
*04:19.380- 04:26.760* :  populated area of the capital Nairobi and now a government spokesperson Isaac Muara has told the
*04:26.760- 04:32.860* :  press that the facility was illegal and he suggested corruption was to blame. It's quite unfortunate
*04:32.860- 04:37.900* :  that we've been seeing here. This is a yard, an illegal gas filling yard, which have not been licensed
*04:37.900- 04:43.260* :  but then they continued to operate in such a residential area, a high density area. And it's quite
*04:43.260- 04:48.620* :  unfortunate that it has happened. Just showing how, sometimes we have weak, you know, enforcement
*04:48.620- 04:53.060* :  institutions, and of course, the element of corruption, which has now led to the death of three of us,
*04:53.060- 04:58.500* :  enemies. So he says corruption may be to blame. It's surely it's the responsibility that
*04:58.500- 05:03.020* :  the Kenan authorities to crack down on that. Are they making much effort to do that? Well, in this
*05:03.100- 05:08.760* :  particular case, it's it's early days, but of course, the fact that they're saying that three
*05:08.760- 05:15.360* :  applications were put in to construct this facility and they were rejected. We don't know why,
*05:15.360- 05:21.740* :  but presumably because there are so many people living in the area, it's a residential area.
*05:21.740- 05:27.840* :  But I think once again, Kenan's are kind of, you know, seeing or potentially seeing the rule
*05:27.840- 05:34.200* :  of law being bent. And as the spokesperson said there, if corruption is to blame, you know,
*05:34.200- 05:42.080* :  it's a long list of issues in Kenya where bribes and corruption then lead to disasters. And
*05:42.100- 05:49.020* :  another example would be the roads in Kenya. And recently, there was a lot of concern about the
*05:49.080- 05:55.540* :  the high number of deaths on the roads, fatal accidents. And the ethics and anti-corruption
*05:55.540- 06:02.460* :  commission just last month said that it was very much that the fault of police officers taking
*06:02.460- 06:09.720* :  bribes and turning a blind eye to vehicles that were in a bad state or drivers not doing the right
*06:09.720- 06:14.420* :  thing. So it just seems that there are rules in place, there's anti-corruption measures, but
*06:15.160- 06:20.320* :  when when money's involved and bribes are paid that the rules sometimes are bent. That was Will
*06:20.320- 06:27.340* :  Ross. The Ukrainian city of Harkiv has come under renewed attack by Russian missiles in recent weeks.
*06:27.740- 06:32.880* :  Ukraine's second largest city is so close to the border that sirens can often sound after the
*06:32.880- 06:40.100* :  missiles hit. Air defences have next to no time to react. Now almost two years into the full-scale
*06:40.100- 06:46.400* :  war and with no end in sight, parts of life in Harkiv are now moving underground. Our eastern
*06:46.400- 06:49.160* :  Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford reports from the city.
*06:54.320- 07:00.100* :  Russia's war has transformed everything in Harkiv, including childhood.
*07:01.420- 07:05.640* :  Nika skips in her pink wellas through a neighborhood that's been shattered by missiles.
*07:08.240- 07:13.000* :  Russia is so close here, when it fires at this city, the missiles can't be stopped.
*07:15.480- 07:19.320* :  At six-year-old Nika is cheerful because she's on her way to kindergarten.
*07:20.200- 07:23.140* :  It was closed for two years because of the danger.
*07:27.820- 07:29.520* :  Now it's moved underground.
*07:31.960- 07:38.760* :  Running alongside the platform on the metro, there's a corridor of classrooms
*07:41.780- 07:44.160* :  and this is a whole lesson on laughing.
*07:46.700- 07:51.760* :  It's the first chance many of the children have had to play together for months. Here,
*07:52.160- 07:55.660* :  when the sirens wail for an air raid, no one has to move.
*07:59.040- 08:03.020* :  Nika's mother Olga talks a lot about Harkiv's strength and its resilience.
*08:05.740- 08:08.620* :  But that doesn't stop Olga being scared for her daughter.
*08:12.200- 08:18.860* :  It's better underground. It's safe. A child can continue with a more or less normal life in
*08:18.860- 08:23.660* :  these conditions. The parents won't worry and the enemy won't get us here.
*08:27.120- 08:29.680* :  So life beneath Harkiv is expanding.
*08:37.840- 08:42.400* :  In the art here, there's a huge construction site in a hole in the ground.
*08:42.400- 08:46.660* :  It's at least the size of a football pitch and there are men upwork here.
*08:46.660- 08:48.600* :  They're drilling and they're welding and they're digging.
*08:49.440- 08:54.540* :  But what they're making here is extraordinary. This is a giant underground school
*08:55.780- 08:59.260* :  being built so that children can study here in safety.
*09:08.400- 09:13.440* :  The missiles most often used to wreck our city take 40 seconds to fly here.
*09:14.460- 09:16.620* :  That's no time to evacuate a school.
*09:20.160- 09:24.320* :  I really don't want us to move underground. This is a forced safety measure.
*09:24.860- 09:27.980* :  This war will end when we win. But in the meantime,
*09:27.980- 09:31.780* :  children have the right to study, so we're building these schools.
*09:34.780- 09:39.160* :  A war that once seemed impossible now shows no sign of ending.
*09:40.000- 09:41.740* :  The Harkiv has to adapt.
*09:44.780- 09:48.360* :  Back up preschool on the metro, Nika is in her element.
*09:49.040- 09:53.460* :  The teachers are too trying to make this subterranean life seem normal.
*09:57.580- 10:03.340* :  What can we do? The woman in charge wants to know if we want our children to grow up here in Ukraine.
*10:03.340- 10:03.960* :  In the meantime,
*10:04.580- 10:06.500* :  we have a lot of hope and hope.
*10:08.840- 10:11.060* :  Current visitors, when there's peace, she says,
*10:11.560- 10:13.660* :  and I'll show you our normal kindergartens.
*10:16.360- 10:18.680* :  Then suddenly, Natalia starts to cry.
*10:21.340- 10:24.140* :  It is all so sad, Natalia says.
*10:25.060- 10:28.920* :  But it is okay. Everything will be okay.
*10:31.220- 10:33.260* :  Sarah reigns for reporting from Ukraine.
*10:35.020- 10:40.600* :  There are fresh signs that a deal for a new truce between Israel and Hamas could be getting closer.
*10:41.120- 10:46.160* :  Israel has repeatedly stated that it won't stop its war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.
*10:46.700- 10:51.140* :  But now Qatar, acting as a mediator, says Hamas has given its initial approval
*10:51.460- 10:53.080* :  of a hostage prisoner exchange.
*10:53.080- 10:56.420* :  For more, I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem, Nick Beak.
*10:57.200- 11:01.600* :  There is optimism, and that's reflected certainly on the front pages of all the newspapers here.
*11:01.960- 11:06.920* :  If you go on to the various news websites, this is the story people are talking about
*11:06.920- 11:10.500* :  that behind the scenes momentum is building towards a deal.
*11:10.840- 11:12.520* :  Certainly, we're not there yet.
*11:12.520- 11:18.420* :  But as you mentioned, the latest sort of hope and optimism has been generated, I think,
*11:18.420- 11:24.360* :  by the foreign ministry in Qatar, saying that in their dealings with Hamas,
*11:24.360- 11:28.220* :  they believe that Hamas has looked at this sort of proposal that's been put together.
*11:28.220- 11:31.640* :  And their initial thought is that this is something they can work with.
*11:31.640- 11:34.320* :  So, I mean, this is by no means a done deal.
*11:34.320- 11:39.600* :  And of course, another complication here is the internal politics within Israel.
*11:40.020- 11:43.580* :  You've got some members of the government on the far right saying that they'd walk away
*11:43.580- 11:46.700* :  if any Palestinian prisoners were released as part of a deal.
*11:47.160- 11:49.740* :  But I mean, it is clear that some will have to be released.
*11:49.740- 11:53.240* :  It would seem if those hostages who were taken on October 7th
*11:53.460- 11:54.580* :  are to be released.
*11:54.740- 11:56.260* :  So, we're certainly not there yet.
*11:56.260- 11:59.400* :  But there are potentially encouraging signs, I'd say, Nick.
*11:59.840- 12:04.520* :  Meanwhile, as we say, every day of the fighting has continued overnight in Gaza.
*12:05.020- 12:06.940* :  Where's the focus, particularly, at the moment?
*12:08.420- 12:10.840* :  Yes, well, the Israeli military and given their latest update.
*12:10.840- 12:15.640* :  I've been talking about hitting Hamas both in the north and the south,
*12:15.640- 12:17.300* :  but also in the center of Gaza.
*12:17.800- 12:22.440* :  We know there's sustainability around Han Unis, the city in the south.
*12:22.740- 12:26.180* :  You've got the Hamas-run health ministry saying more than 100 people were killed
*12:26.700- 12:29.360* :  in Israeli strikes overnight.
*12:29.500- 12:33.180* :  Interestingly, this morning, the Defence Minister here in Israel
*12:33.620- 12:37.700* :  is saying that when their operations have concluded in Han Unis,
*12:38.020- 12:41.940* :  the IDF will move further south towards Raffa, where, of course,
*12:42.700- 12:47.380* :  hundreds of thousands of people have moved to because it's right on the border with Egypt.
*12:47.380- 12:50.060* :  People thinking they'd be seeking safety there.
*12:50.380- 12:52.600* :  They were instructed by the Israelis to move there.
*12:52.980- 12:57.840* :  But the Defence Minister here saying that that will be the next focus of attention.
*12:57.980- 12:59.920* :  So, I think there is a discrepancy.
*12:59.920- 13:04.760* :  We get this sort of tough talk from ministers and the military saying that they won't let up.
*13:05.040- 13:07.760* :  But it's clear that there will have to be a pause in the fighting
*13:07.760- 13:10.620* :  if there is some sort of hostage-release deal,
*13:10.920- 13:14.100* :  which would see potentially a ceasefire of six weeks or so.
*13:14.100- 13:16.180* :  That's the sort of duration people are talking about, Nick.
*13:16.720- 13:17.480* :  That was Nick Beak.
*13:18.780- 13:24.180* :  It was one of the world's biggest financial scandals between 2009 and 2012.
*13:24.220- 13:29.140* :  Four billion dollars were siphoned out of Malaysia's sovereign well-fund.
*13:29.900- 13:33.480* :  One of those people jailed for his involvement has had his prison sentence
*13:33.480- 13:37.360* :  halved the country's former Prime Minister Najib Razak
*13:38.040- 13:40.680* :  was convicted of money laundering and abuse of power.
*13:41.260- 13:43.840* :  Mickey Bristo, our Asia-Pacific editor, told us more.
*13:44.580- 13:47.660* :  You say there it was one of the world's biggest financial scandals it was.
*13:48.180- 13:50.620* :  It related to a fund called 1MDB.
*13:50.620- 13:54.260* :  Essentially, the Malaysian government sold bonds to investors
*13:55.140- 13:57.400* :  in order to raise money for economic developments.
*13:58.100- 13:59.720* :  That didn't happen much of the money.
*13:59.720- 14:01.220* :  It was just siphoned off.
*14:01.720- 14:04.900* :  Some of it went to fund political campaigns,
*14:04.900- 14:07.600* :  which is where Najib Razak comes in.
*14:07.600- 14:12.920* :  But a lot of it was used to finance luxury lifestyle for one of the main people behind
*14:12.920- 14:15.920* :  is a gentleman called Jolos, currently on the run, by the way.
*14:15.920- 14:21.700* :  He used the money to buy a super yacht, private jet, hotel stays, jewelry,
*14:22.300- 14:26.300* :  even used it to fund a Hollywood film, The Wolf of Wall Street.
*14:26.400- 14:27.640* :  Ironic, that one, isn't it?
*14:28.760- 14:35.180* :  Najib Razak in 2020 was convicted of taking nine million dollars
*14:35.180- 14:37.220* :  and putting it into his personal bank account.
*14:37.780- 14:39.320* :  That's what he got 12 years for.
*14:39.760- 14:41.700* :  That's the sentence which has been halved.
*14:41.700- 14:46.620* :  Now he's also had a reduction in the fine he had to pay from $40 million to $10 million.
*14:47.360- 14:50.360* :  And Mickey, do we know why his sentence has been reduced?
*14:50.360- 14:52.220* :  And what reaction to that has been?
*14:52.840- 14:59.220* :  In a word, no, the review board which looked at this fine and sentence
*14:59.220- 15:03.780* :  didn't say exactly or didn't say at all really why it had reduced the sentence.
*15:03.780- 15:07.720* :  And that's a question many people are asking exactly why?
*15:07.720- 15:09.260* :  You know, all these crimes were committed.
*15:09.260- 15:12.060* :  You've been convicted of taking money.
*15:12.060- 15:15.280* :  Why have you had your sentence reduced?
*15:15.820- 15:18.960* :  Also, questions are being asked to the prime minister in Malaysia at the moment.
*15:18.960- 15:24.080* :  And why Abraham, whether it's been some backroom dealings involving him
*15:24.080- 15:29.700* :  because Najib Razak's former party or his party still in actually is now in government.
*15:29.700- 15:33.980* :  So there is a suggestion of political maneuvering behind the scenes,
*15:34.020- 15:37.320* :  which a lot of people have criticized and you can understand why.
*15:37.420- 15:42.300* :  And say, Mickey, remind us how Najib Razak's conviction was seen at the time.
*15:43.120- 15:45.660* :  It was a groundbreaking conviction actually.
*15:45.660- 15:50.320* :  I was in Malaysia on the first day he appeared in court and you would get people coming
*15:50.320- 15:54.880* :  out of other court rooms just to see this former prime minister being led up
*15:55.260- 15:57.920* :  into his own into the dock himself.
*15:57.920- 16:03.180* :  You know, they were astonished that a man who'd been accused of corruption for so many years
*16:03.180- 16:05.820* :  was finally, finally being brought to trial.
*16:05.820- 16:10.440* :  So there was a great celebration when he was convicted actually.
*16:10.440- 16:16.440* :  And a sense that here is Malaysia can convict some years high as a prime minister.
*16:16.680- 16:19.100* :  Somebody who's held the office of prime minister for corruption.
*16:20.020- 16:20.560* :  Mickey Bristol.
*16:21.920- 16:25.940* :  Millions of commuters and travelers in Germany have had their journeys disrupted
*16:25.960- 16:29.400* :  as public transport workers have come out on a one-day strike.
*16:30.260- 16:35.220* :  Bus, local trains and tram stations across the country, apart from in Bavaria,
*16:35.220- 16:38.420* :  are at a standstill as workers demand better pay and conditions.
*16:39.100- 16:42.220* :  It's the latest in the series of strikes affecting transport in Germany.
*16:42.220- 16:45.840* :  Last week, intercity trains grew round to a halt for five days.
*16:46.280- 16:48.560* :  And on Thursday, thousands of flights were cancelled.
*16:49.180- 16:51.820* :  We heard more from our Germany correspondent, Damien McGinnis.
*16:52.660- 16:56.840* :  It's trams, it's buses, it's undergrounds, which means for a lot of people,
*16:56.840- 17:03.140* :  they can't use public transport to get to work and in some regions, even the closing school.
*17:03.140- 17:04.820* :  So it does have a big impact on people.
*17:04.820- 17:11.220* :  But I think the broader impact is really the fact that this is just one of a string of industrial
*17:11.220- 17:13.340* :  actions across the country.
*17:13.340- 17:19.820* :  You've already had yesterday airports across the country were affected more than a thousand flights
*17:19.820- 17:22.720* :  were grounded because ground staff went on strike.
*17:23.080- 17:25.140* :  We've already had the train strike in some regions.
*17:25.140- 17:29.340* :  We've had hospitals, seeing industrial action, we've had date run, kindergarten's closing.
*17:29.740- 17:34.500* :  So it's something now, over the past year, really, that German people are becoming increasingly used to.
*17:34.520- 17:38.780* :  It's not something we used to see very often because it used to be a very good system of negotiation
*17:38.780- 17:40.640* :  between workers and employers.
*17:40.900- 17:45.640* :  But to a certain extent, that is breaking down because mainly of inflation and people are really
*17:45.640- 17:46.460* :  feeling the squeeze.
*17:46.460- 17:50.460* :  So a lot of workers are saying it's time to increase wages.
*17:51.120- 17:53.960* :  But really, also, when you look at them for consumers, it's not all bad,
*17:53.960- 17:58.080* :  because what we have with low unemployment and a lack of workers, it does mean that workers
*17:58.080- 17:59.780* :  are feeling like they can ask for more money.
*18:00.280- 18:03.700* :  German wages have traditionally been, have stayed low for a long time.
*18:03.700- 18:06.200* :  So you could argue it's time for a wage right.
*18:06.200- 18:10.920* :  The problem is that these strikes are affecting the German economy slightly.
*18:11.460- 18:13.580* :  I think it depends how long they go on from here on really.
*18:13.580- 18:15.660* :  We are seeing signs of breakthroughs in some sectors,
*18:16.180- 18:20.860* :  but it depends if workers and employers can get down to the table and resolve some of those issues.
*18:20.860- 18:24.720* :  If they can, I think the economy will stay at this level.
*18:24.920- 18:27.300* :  It's not a disaster zone, but it's not looking great.
*18:27.300- 18:29.940* :  But I think growth is predicted for this year.
*18:30.340- 18:34.560* :  If strike action gets worse, though, that could well have a broader impact on how Germany is
*18:34.560- 18:39.220* :  seen broadly, really, when it comes to the economic performances here in the country.
*18:40.040- 18:40.660* :  Gaming begins.
*18:43.400- 18:48.400* :  Still to come, we will hear why the Grammy Awards will have a new category for African music.
*18:48.900- 18:53.020* :  Afro beats, I'm a piano other music from the continent has become very,
*18:53.020- 18:56.820* :  very much a part of what's happening with pop music and popular music.
*19:09.980- 19:12.500* :  For just as long as Hollywood has been Tinseltown,
*19:12.900- 19:17.540* :  there have been suspicions about what lurks behind the glitz and glamour.
*19:18.460- 19:23.540* :  And for a while, those suspicions grew into something much bigger and much darker.
*19:24.020- 19:27.960* :  Are you a member of the Communist Party or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
*19:28.500- 19:32.740* :  I'm Una Chaplin and from CBC podcasts and the BBC World Service,
*19:33.220- 19:34.980* :  this is Hollywood Exiles.
*19:35.720- 19:41.180* :  It's about a battle for the political soul of America and the battlefield was Hollywood.
*19:42.100- 19:45.820* :  Search for Hollywood Exiles wherever you get your podcasts.
*19:49.100- 19:54.260* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast, an Italian mafia boss who's on a list of Europe's
*19:54.260- 19:59.780* :  most wanted criminals has been recaptured in Corsica after he escaped from prison last year.
*20:00.200- 20:05.620* :  The authorities in France and Italy confirmed that Marco Raduano had been detained in Bastia,
*20:05.620- 20:07.080* :  the capital of the French island.
*20:07.760- 20:09.100* :  Hugh Scofield reports from Paris.
*20:10.080- 20:14.520* :  In a joint operation run by Italian and French special police, Marco Raduano was arrested
*20:14.520- 20:19.520* :  on Thursday in Corsica. At the same moment in southern Spain, a similar operation picked up one
*20:19.520- 20:24.980* :  of his leading left tenants. Raduano, who's 40, came to the public eye last year when he escaped from
*20:24.980- 20:31.040* :  prison in Sardinia using the time on a method of knotted sheets. He'd been serving a 24-year sentence
*20:31.040- 20:36.520* :  for extortion and drug trafficking. The Fudgeur crime syndicate of which he said to be a boss
*20:36.940- 20:42.220* :  is sometimes described as Italy's fourth mafia after the more famous organizations in Sicily,
*20:42.220- 20:49.440* :  Calabria and Naples. Hugh Scofield. The mother of a boy who killed four pupils at his high school
*20:49.440- 20:55.960* :  in the US state of Michigan in 2021 has taken the stand at her involuntary manslaughter trial.
*20:56.620- 21:01.460* :  Jennifer Crumbly and her husband James are the first parents of a school shooter to face
*21:01.460- 21:07.080* :  felony charges in the United States for the actions of their child that Crumbly has denied the
*21:07.080- 21:14.220* :  allegations. As a parent, you spend your whole life trying to protect your child from other dangers.
*21:14.820- 21:19.380* :  You never would think you have to protect your child from harming somebody else. That's what
*21:20.460- 21:23.560* :  blew my mind. I just, that was the hardest thing I had to
*21:24.480- 21:28.160* :  to stomach is that my child harmed and killed other people.
*21:29.080- 21:31.740* :  For more on this story, here's Will Vernon from Washington.
*21:32.440- 21:38.760* :  Ikin November 2021, Ethan Crumbly was just 15 years old when he shot dead four of his fellow
*21:38.760- 21:45.500* :  students and wounded seven others. Just four days before the shooting, he had been given a handgun
*21:45.500- 21:52.420* :  by his parents as a present, a nine millimeter weapon that of course then became the murder weapon.
*21:52.720- 21:57.920* :  Now testifying in court, Jennifer Crumbly said that it was her husband that purchased
*21:58.740- 22:04.060* :  that handgun and that it was intended for use at a local shooting range. Now prosecutors
*22:04.060- 22:11.440* :  allege that Jennifer Crumbly ignored her son's downhill spiral into serious mental health problems.
*22:11.440- 22:16.080* :  On the morning of the shooting, her and her husband got called into the school after some
*22:16.080- 22:21.460* :  concerning drawings were discovered. There they were told that their son required counseling,
*22:21.460- 22:27.380* :  but they didn't take him home and they took no action. Of course, he went on to carry out that
*22:27.380- 22:34.900* :  mass killing. Now prosecutors also say that Jennifer Crumbly did nothing when her son asked for help
*22:34.900- 22:41.660* :  with his mental health problems. He told her that he saw demons in the house. She said in court
*22:41.660- 22:46.480* :  that she thought he was just messing around. Now Jennifer Crumbly denies all allegations of
*22:46.480- 22:52.080* :  involuntary manslaughter. She says she couldn't possibly have foreseen what her son was about to do.
*22:52.720- 22:58.940* :  Her husband James Crumbly will be tried separately and as for Ethan Crumbly, well he pleaded guilty
*22:58.940- 23:04.300* :  to first degree murder and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
*23:05.100- 23:10.880* :  Will Vernon. When Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office as president of the Philippines in 2022,
*23:10.880- 23:16.620* :  he said he would make the country safe for journalists. Under his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte,
*23:16.620- 23:21.420* :  the country developed a reputation for harassment of journalists, but prominently with
*23:21.420- 23:26.820* :  Nobel Prize winner Maria Ressa and her Rappler news site. So has anything changed?
*23:27.440- 23:31.760* :  Irene Khan is the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression.
*23:32.320- 23:37.160* :  She's visiting the Philippines at the moment and spoke to Victoria Wankunda about what she's been
*23:37.160- 23:42.320* :  fighting out. There is definitely a change of tone with the new administration. It is not
*23:42.320- 23:47.500* :  haranging them in the way in the previous one did. It's more open. However, there are some
*23:47.720- 23:53.700* :  deeper problems that persist last year when the new administration was in charge for journalists
*23:53.700- 23:59.540* :  were killed. There remain, of course, impunity for crimes committed against journalists before
*23:59.540- 24:05.920* :  that time. There is also some remnants from the previous regime in that some of these journalists,
*24:06.480- 24:12.300* :  particularly community media, are tagged, rep tagged, as they say, which is basically branded as
*24:12.300- 24:20.160* :  being pro-communist or pro-insurgency, and then they can be attacked. They can end up in prison
*24:20.160- 24:26.680* :  under anti-terrorism charges. I met a young community journalist, 25 years old, who has been
*24:27.180- 24:32.740* :  now, she was arrested when she was 21, and now she's 25 years old, and she's been accused of
*24:32.740- 24:38.680* :  being a communist fighter, of course, which seems quite unbelievable, but there she is still,
*24:38.680- 24:44.360* :  and still hasn't come to trial yet. So yes, there are a lot of problems to be solved from the
*24:44.360- 24:50.920* :  previous regime. So what needs to change? What to improve the conditions for the journalists or
*24:50.920- 24:56.960* :  anybody who is a fan of freedom of expression? Well, first thing that means to change is the mindset
*24:56.960- 25:01.340* :  that journalists have a job to do. They're going to speak the truth. They are going to have certain
*25:01.340- 25:06.060* :  opinions, the government, and they're going to criticize the state. So there's an issue of mindset.
*25:06.140- 25:12.400* :  The second is that journalists also have to be supported. Access to information, there is
*25:13.400- 25:20.700* :  presidential order, but actually getting information is difficult. And very rapidly, journalists who
*25:20.940- 25:27.100* :  are writing critical pieces are being labeled as this fake news, disinformation. Then they still
*25:27.100- 25:32.140* :  have criminal libel laws and cybercriminal laws, libel laws that were used against Maria Ressa.
*25:32.140- 25:37.200* :  Maria Ressa has one charge still pending in the Supreme Court and cyber libel. And that has a
*25:37.200- 25:43.800* :  chilling effect. So government has to realize that democracy requires a free independent diverse
*25:43.800- 25:49.680* :  pluralistic media and create that enabling environment. I think Marcos has started in the right way.
*25:49.680- 25:55.300* :  He's much nicer to journalists, he's more open to them, but he has to do more to show his real
*25:55.300- 26:01.460* :  commitment to media freedom. I really can't there. But the first time African music is going to have
*26:01.460- 26:06.720* :  its own category at the Grammy Awards taking place this Sunday in Los Angeles. There are three new
*26:06.720- 26:11.620* :  categories for this year's awards, including best African music performance featuring some of
*26:11.620- 26:18.580* :  Afro beats global superstars. Harvey Mason Jr is the CEO of the Recording Academy, which runs
*26:18.580- 26:23.320* :  the Grammy Awards. And he told us why there's now a new category of Afro beats.
*26:24.060- 26:28.900* :  All the ideas for what we do with our awards generally come from our membership.
*26:29.400- 26:34.400* :  There's a lot of work to listen and understand what's happening. And so obviously Afro beats,
*26:34.400- 26:40.040* :  I'm a piano, other music from the continent has become very, very much a part of what's happening
*26:40.040- 26:50.580* :  with pop music and popular music. You're seeing collaborations with some of today's biggest
*26:51.180- 26:56.520* :  western artists with artists from the continent. You're seeing the music consumed here by the fans
*26:56.520- 27:02.880* :  really globally actually. But some of the Afro beats has been around for quite some time now
*27:03.420- 27:10.380* :  and would want to know, I want to know why did it take so long before these jars from the African
*27:10.380- 27:18.020* :  continent were featured in the Academy. Well really the Academy honors music that is released in
*27:18.020- 27:23.520* :  the U.S. So there's been a change in technology which has allowed music to be created anywhere
*27:32.440- 27:36.260* :  and consumed anywhere. Music from the continent is prevalent now everywhere around the world and
*27:36.260- 27:42.540* :  the Academy is now a new academy. It is attentive, it's fluid, it's adjusting, it's pivoting.
*27:43.020- 27:47.120* :  And so we take great pride in the fact that we are paying close attention to what's going on
*27:47.120- 27:53.120* :  globally with music not just in the West. And so this is something that we're really excited about.
*27:53.560- 27:58.760* :  We've got some of the best, it's not the best of the best at the moment from Africa. You've got
*27:58.760- 28:05.940* :  Davido, you've got Ayra Star, you've got Tyler, you've got Banner Boy, Asha Ke, Olamide. That is like
*28:05.940- 28:12.420* :  the top of the top of the moment in Africa in terms of music and entertainment. It seems like
*28:12.420- 28:16.740* :  our voters did a good job. We have to make sure we have the right voters and voters that are
*28:16.740- 28:22.140* :  knowledgeable understand this genre in order to be able to vote and reflect and
*28:23.500- 28:24.280* :  represent the genre.
*28:30.800- 28:33.700* :  Harvey Mason Jr. speaking to Victoria Orncunda.
*28:35.400- 28:40.040* :  Police in India have finally released a pigeon that they detained for eight months
*28:40.140- 28:45.840* :  after suspecting that it was part of a Chinese espionage ring. The BBC's security
*28:45.840- 28:51.360* :  correspondent Gordon Carrera told us more. The poor pigeon was detained for eight months
*28:52.200- 28:58.160* :  because it had been found near Mumbai with two rings tied to its leg and apparently a message
*28:58.920- 29:04.680* :  which looked like it was in Chinese. And the suspicion was that this was a pigeon which
*29:04.680- 29:11.420* :  had been used to covertly send messages somehow carrying intelligence perhaps from India. And as a
*29:11.420- 29:16.140* :  result it was detained. Now it seems to have taken eight months to establish that that wasn't the
*29:16.180- 29:22.840* :  case and it was actually a Taiwanese racing pigeon that had escaped and made its way somehow to
*29:22.840- 29:27.760* :  India and obviously got lost and has since been cleared. But it does actually go to the issue about
*29:27.760- 29:34.060* :  both concerns over spying and even potentially the role of pigeons in carrying messages and being
*29:34.060- 29:40.100* :  pigeon spies. Yeah I mean there is a long long history of that being done going back way
*29:40.100- 29:47.900* :  to a prehistory almost but it does seem really a bit of a stretch to suspect that pigeons
*29:47.900- 29:54.180* :  will be used a very low tech form of espionage isn't it in the 21st century? Well it is but it's
*29:54.180- 29:57.780* :  fascinating because of course the thing about pigeons is that they can find their way home so you
*29:57.780- 30:02.340* :  can drop them in one place and someone could give them a message or tie a message to their legs
*30:02.340- 30:07.580* :  and it could get back. Now that's been used for message carrying as you said for millennia.
*30:07.900- 30:13.300* :  It was used in the Second World War by Britain they dropped pigeons behind enemy lines as it were
*30:13.300- 30:19.920* :  an occupied Europe to get information back on occupied Nazi Europe but actually pigeons are still
*30:19.920- 30:26.040* :  being used. I mean there have been cases of pigeons being used by the CIA as late as the 1970s
*30:26.360- 30:31.580* :  and there have been reports of spy pigeons. The Iranians said they found one in around 2008
*30:31.580- 30:37.600* :  and one of their nuclear sites, India and Pakistan have both traded accusations about spy
*30:37.600- 30:42.700* :  pigeons and it is true actually that the Chinese military, the People's Liberation Army there,
*30:42.940- 30:47.940* :  about 10 years ago said it was training something like 10,000 pigeons and in that case it was
*30:48.300- 30:52.980* :  less for spies but the theory was that if there was some kind of cyber attack or something which
*30:52.980- 30:57.800* :  took down regular communications then actually they might need to rely on pigeons for communications
*30:57.800- 31:05.600* :  again so they may still have their role believe it or not. Gordon Carrera and that's all from us for
*31:05.600- 31:11.140* :  now but before we go here's Jackie with news of this week's happy boy. In this week's edition he
