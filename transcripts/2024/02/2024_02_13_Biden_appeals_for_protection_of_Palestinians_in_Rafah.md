*01:07.800- 01:11.040* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:13.840- 01:18.360* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Tuesday the 13th of February, these are our main
*01:18.360- 01:22.600* :  stories. President Biden has described the more than one million Palestinians
*01:22.600- 01:28.380* :  sheltering in Raffa as exposed and vulnerable, and warned Israel they need to be protected.
*01:28.960- 01:33.460* :  Germany's Chancellor has called for a dramatic increase in arms manufacturing in Europe,
*01:33.500- 01:39.700* :  and Ukraine has reacted angrily to a protest by Polish farmers who emptied the contents of several
*01:39.700- 01:47.340* :  Ukrainian lorries in a dispute of cheap grain imports. Also coming up in this podcast.
*01:56.920- 02:00.580* :  It's one hundred years since George Gershwin's musical composition,
*02:00.640- 02:03.660* :  Rhapsody in Blue, had its premiere in New York City.
*02:07.920- 02:12.200* :  We're going to start though in Washington, D.C., where President Biden has appealed for the
*02:12.200- 02:16.600* :  more than one million Palestinians sheltering in Raffa to be protected,
*02:17.460- 02:19.340* :  describing them as exposed and vulnerable.
*02:19.960- 02:23.860* :  They were speaking at the White House after meeting the Jordanian monarch King Abdullah.
*02:24.260- 02:29.320* :  The major military operation in Raffa should not proceed without a credible plan,
*02:29.320- 02:34.100* :  a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than one million people's
*02:34.100- 02:39.780* :  sheltering there. They need to be protected, and we've also been clear from the start.
*02:40.360- 02:43.800* :  We oppose any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.
*02:44.440- 02:48.200* :  What Jordan's King made these remarks regarding the conflict in Gaza,
*02:48.200- 02:51.360* :  following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th?
*02:51.680- 02:54.720* :  All attacks against innocent civilians, women and children,
*02:55.480- 02:59.880* :  including those of October 7th, cannot be accepted by any Muslim
*03:00.940- 03:06.360* :  as I had previously stressed. We must make sure the horrors of the past few months,
*03:07.080- 03:12.860* :  since October 7th, are never repeated nor accepted by any human being.
*03:13.480- 03:17.200* :  King Abdullah of Jordan, and before that, the U.S. President Joe Biden.
*03:17.720- 03:22.640* :  Well, earlier, the U.S. State Department defended Israeli air strikes on the city of Raffa
*03:23.020- 03:25.980* :  in support of Monday's hostage rescue operation.
*03:25.980- 03:31.840* :  The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says around 100 Palestinians were killed in the strikes.
*03:32.600- 03:38.340* :  Meanwhile, senior United Nations officials have stepped up calls for Israel to refrain from
*03:38.340- 03:43.220* :  undertaking a fully fledged military operation in the city in the south of Gaza.
*03:43.700- 03:48.940* :  The UN Human Rights Chief Falkerturk was speaking after the Israeli operation to rescue the two
*03:48.940- 03:54.980* :  hostages. Later, Hamas claimed that three hostages, it was holding, who were injured in recent
*03:54.980- 04:00.260* :  Israeli air strikes, have now died. The head of the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees,
*04:00.260- 04:05.220* :  Philippe Lazareini, said order in Raffa was breaking down. Speaking in Brussels on Monday,
*04:05.720- 04:08.760* :  he said it was increasingly difficult to operate in the city.
*04:09.400- 04:16.880* :  Yesterday, for the first time, the UN could not operate with a minimum of protection which was
*04:16.880- 04:23.180* :  the local police, and because we had no local police, our trucks, our convoys at the border
*04:23.760- 04:29.500* :  have been looted, and trucks have been vandalized by a hundred of young people.
*04:30.180- 04:36.400* :  The last remaining, I would say, protection to keep a minimum of civil order which was the
*04:36.400- 04:44.540* :  local police, might not be functional anymore since many of them have been killed over the last
*04:44.540- 04:51.440* :  few days and are more and more reluctant to be seen in these convoys. What about the people who
*04:51.440- 04:57.180* :  actually live there? Most of whom have fled from the north of Gaza on the orders of Israel's military?
*04:57.180- 05:04.100* :  Orgada El-Qud has moved six times in four months with her children, and she's now sheltering
*05:04.100- 05:10.400* :  at a relative's home in Raffa. The Israeli military operation will start soon. We are waiting to
*05:11.520- 05:17.400* :  the Israeli forces to throw some of the liars telling us where to evacuate. This is
*05:17.400- 05:25.760* :  happened before, and even they are published on their social media platforms where to evacuate.
*05:26.180- 05:31.380* :  Well, Israel's military insists, though, that it will target Raffa, and what it says is the
*05:31.380- 05:35.940* :  remaining Hamas militants based in the city. Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner from the
*05:35.940- 05:40.760* :  Israel Defence Force said it was working to limit the impact on civilians, though, by moving
*05:40.760- 05:45.900* :  them to safety. The government has instructed the IDF to create a plan of action, which includes,
*05:45.900- 05:51.460* :  of course, both the operational plan to achieve our military goals of dismantling and destroying
*05:51.460- 05:58.980* :  Hamas and bringing home the hostages, but also a plan that evacuates civilians, non-involved,
*05:58.980- 06:04.720* :  non-combatants, from the potential combat areas. There are less people or no people in their
*06:04.720- 06:08.700* :  center in the north of Gaza. There are other places that they can be moved. Well, for more,
*06:08.700- 06:14.220* :  I spoke to our correspondent Nick Beak, who's in Jerusalem, and I asked him if there was any news of
*06:14.220- 06:20.440* :  a possible plan by Israel to give safe passage to those in Raffa before it carried out a ground
*06:20.440- 06:25.720* :  operation. The Prime Minister here Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the military bosses to come
*06:25.720- 06:32.200* :  up with this plan to move this huge amount of people. 1.5 million is the estimate, and that
*06:32.200- 06:38.440* :  population of the city of Raffa, five times what it was just a few months ago, and it's not a built-up
*06:38.480- 06:44.280* :  city. Most people are living in intense, and they're saying that there's a lack of clean water,
*06:44.280- 06:51.000* :  lack of food, lack of medicine. Lots of aid agencies saying that it's a really perilous situation.
*06:51.120- 06:56.520* :  So yeah, we are waiting to see what sort of plan the Israeli army has drawn up, because of
*06:56.520- 07:01.220* :  course the idea is they move people out, and then afterwards they go in and hit Hamas hard.
*07:01.220- 07:06.460* :  They're talking about four remaining battalions that they need to wipe out. Yesterday we heard
*07:06.460- 07:11.500* :  from Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, who sounded utterly adamant in his personal
*07:11.500- 07:18.780* :  determination to push on with the last remaining military operation into Raffa. Is there any sense
*07:18.780- 07:24.380* :  that the warnings from the UN calls with President Biden are going to make him think again,
*07:24.380- 07:30.140* :  or going to limit his actions, do you think? For now there is absolutely no sign that it's making
*07:30.140- 07:36.220* :  any impact whatsoever. As you say the Americans, whether that's Anthony Blinken, the US's top diplomat
*07:36.220- 07:40.860* :  who was here, the Secretary of State, also President Biden. We know he had a 45-minute phone call
*07:40.860- 07:45.740* :  with Mr Netanyahu yesterday. You've got David Cameron, the British Foreign Secretary,
*07:45.740- 07:50.380* :  foreign minister saying today that he says it's basically impossible to see how a military
*07:50.380- 07:56.360* :  operation can be fought with so many people there in Raffa who, in his words, have nowhere to go.
*07:56.360- 07:59.620* :  So I mean if it is making an impact on the Israelis, we haven't seen it yet.
*07:59.940- 08:03.220* :  Can I just ask you briefly about relatives of the remaining hostages? As I said,
*08:03.220- 08:07.280* :  mixed news today about those who Hamas said have died, but the two who were released.
*08:07.800- 08:13.700* :  Are they still loud voices in terms of protests or demonstrating and highlighting the
*08:13.700- 08:18.100* :  cause of the hostages who have been held now for five months? Yes, there are. There were people
*08:18.100- 08:23.700* :  still outside Mr Netanyahu's property, his outside his house. But also, interestingly, one of the
*08:23.700- 08:29.800* :  the relatives of the person who was freed today, he actually said, despite his loved one being
*08:29.900- 08:35.660* :  freed, that there needs to be a deal to get the rest of the hostages back. Nick Beek in Jerusalem.
*08:36.020- 08:41.760* :  Now, just going to stay with the situation in Raffa because Gershon Baskin as a former Israeli
*08:41.760- 08:47.140* :  hostage negotiator. And my colleague, Nulam Agavan asked him what he thinks a potential offensive
*08:47.140- 08:53.320* :  by Israel into the southern Gaza city might look like. It seems to me that if there will be a
*08:53.320- 08:59.960* :  military offensive in Raffa, there are three main goals. One is to find and rescue more hostages.
*09:01.100- 09:06.860* :  The second goal would be to find and arrest or kill the Hamas leadership.
*09:07.820- 09:15.460* :  And the third would be to secure and verify that the border between Gaza and Egypt no longer has
*09:15.460- 09:21.200* :  any smuggling tunnels under it. Those are the three things that Israel needs to do in order to
*09:21.200- 09:29.300* :  end the war from its perspective. And because they've swept through the Gaza Strip and pushed the
*09:29.600- 09:35.460* :  civilian population down into the bottom, 20% of the Gaza Strip, you're now about a million and a
*09:35.460- 09:42.140* :  half Palestinians down there. It makes any military operation very, very complex. But you talk
*09:42.140- 09:47.140* :  about a different type of military operation. What would that look like? There's still apparently
*09:47.140- 09:54.220* :  a massive underground network of tunnels and bunkers between Hanunis and Raffa, where the hostages
*09:54.220- 10:00.440* :  are probably located and the Hamas leadership is probably located, making their way to secure the
*10:00.440- 10:05.400* :  Egyptian border. They can't do that without the agreement of Egypt. And I don't think that Egypt
*10:05.400- 10:11.680* :  is going to agree for Israel to do that simply because the fear of pushing the civilian population toward
*10:11.680- 10:18.000* :  Egypt, the solution for the Egyptian border should probably be asking the United States to provide
*10:18.000- 10:24.560* :  technology and know how and for the Egyptians to be doing the drilling and searching for tunnels
*10:24.560- 10:28.440* :  on the Egyptian side of the border where it's calm and quiet and there aren't people.
*10:28.940- 10:35.120* :  Let us also talk about the rescue of the two Israeli hostages. How do you think that rescue
*10:35.120- 10:41.660* :  will affect the talks that are taking place? Talks are supposed to be renewed in Cairo. So far,
*10:41.660- 10:46.540* :  the Israeli war capital is supposed to make a decision this evening on whether or not they're
*10:46.540- 10:52.340* :  sending someone to those talks. There's big pressure from the hostage families to send an Israeli
*10:52.340- 10:57.760* :  official senior. It's really official to those talks. The hostage families are panicking. They're
*10:57.760- 11:02.880* :  both thrilled by the rescue, but they're also very fearful about what Hamas might do to the other
*11:02.880- 11:08.060* :  hostages. There's an assumption in the Israeli security that Hamas is probably moving people
*11:08.060- 11:13.440* :  around again and that's dangerous all the time whenever hostages are moved from one place to another.
*11:14.060- 11:20.080* :  There could be a Hamas decision to execute hostages in order to prevent the additional Israeli
*11:20.080- 11:26.600* :  rescue attempts. There's no precedent for this in Israel's history, nor Hamas's experience with
*11:26.600- 11:32.940* :  Israel and Israeli hostages. My point of view from day one of this war is that the only way to get
*11:32.940- 11:37.780* :  all the hostages home safely is through an agreement with Hamas. The agreement that's on the table
*11:37.780- 11:42.920* :  is not acceptable to the Israelis. They see this surrender and leaving Hamas in place in Gaza.
*11:43.180- 11:49.340* :  My hope is that the negotiations will continue and they will find some way of agreeing to a
*11:49.340- 11:55.680* :  ceasefire. Well, that was Gersh and Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator. Now let's
*11:55.680- 12:02.440* :  step away from the war between Israel and Hamas. Europe needs a massive and urgent increase in
*12:02.440- 12:06.260* :  arms production, so it can defend itself. That's according to Germany's leader.
*12:06.840- 12:11.820* :  Chancellor Olaf Schultz's comments came at a ceremony to break ground on a new factory in the
*12:11.820- 12:16.680* :  north of the country that will ramp up production of shells. The war in Ukraine has exposed
*12:16.680- 12:22.140* :  shortages in the continent's ability to supply its own arms. From Germany, here's our
*12:22.140- 12:26.760* :  correspondent Jessica Parker. Chancellor Schultz dug the first spade into the ground for a new
*12:26.760- 12:32.700* :  ammunition factory to supply Ukraine and domestic stocks, but Germany is among a majority of NATO
*12:32.700- 12:37.720* :  nations which are estimated to have fallen short of the 2 percent defense spending target
*12:37.720- 12:43.140* :  last year. Donald Trump's suggestion that he'd even encourage aggressors to attack members
*12:43.140- 12:49.060* :  which didn't pay their dues has sparked fresh alarm in Europe. I asked Armin Papager,
*12:49.060- 12:55.180* :  the chief executive of Germany's biggest defense firm, Rheinmetall, how long Europe would need to
*12:55.180- 13:02.400* :  be ready to both help Ukraine and defend itself? I think we need 10 years. Really, we need 10 years
*13:02.960- 13:08.240* :  because the stocks are empty and if you really have an aggressor who wants to fight against the
*13:08.240- 13:16.380* :  the NATO, it's a long time. We are fine in three, four years, yes, but to really to be really
*13:16.380- 13:21.360* :  prepared we need 10 years. Defense experts say the chancellor's declaration of Zeitinvender,
*13:21.360- 13:27.180* :  a turning point in defense and foreign policy, has genuinely brought change, but allies want
*13:27.180- 13:31.660* :  Europe's biggest economy to go further in shedding its traditionally cautious approach.
*13:32.180- 13:35.760* :  However, nervousness remains in a country where in the 20th century,
*13:35.760- 13:42.620* :  rearmament led to military and moral catastrophe. Berlin is expected to meet the 2 percent spending
*13:42.620- 13:48.860* :  target this year albeit through a one-off fund. And Chancellor Schultz struck a diplomatic note
*13:48.860- 13:55.040* :  today saying he was sure America would stick by NATO. Next, we're taking you to Poland,
*13:55.040- 14:00.600* :  one of the staunchest supporters of its neighbour Ukraine since the war there began almost two years
*14:01.560- 14:04.980* :  ago. It's also though a country where tensions have boiled over among farmers,
*14:05.400- 14:10.580* :  they're angry about cheap Ukrainian grain being imported and undercutting their harvest.
*14:11.340- 14:16.080* :  Or prosecutors there are investigating claims that some Polish farmers stopped several
*14:16.080- 14:20.280* :  trucks at the border and emptied some of the grain they were carrying onto the road.
*14:20.280- 14:26.160* :  Ukraine has urged Poland to hold those farmers to account. I spoke to the BBC's
*14:26.160- 14:31.680* :  correspondent in Warsaw Adam Eastern and began by asking him why Polish farmers were so frustrated
*14:31.680- 14:37.200* :  with the European Union. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU granted Ukrainian tariff
*14:37.200- 14:43.540* :  re-access to its markets and Polish farmers are essentially demanding that some form of tougher
*14:43.540- 14:51.120* :  trade barrier be reintroduced to protect their livelihoods. Is there any sense among the
*14:51.120- 14:56.460* :  Polish farming community that those terms are granted to assist Ukraine in defense of its
*14:56.460- 15:01.100* :  country? Or does this just come down to harsh pure economics and their realities of being a
*15:01.180- 15:07.400* :  Polish farmer? I think the latter, although Poland stunned the world for its extraordinary
*15:07.400- 15:13.180* :  humanitarian response to Ukrainian refugees who flooded into the country and are still about
*15:13.180- 15:18.340* :  a million here. Two years on, I think people have now, particularly if you're a Polish farmer,
*15:18.340- 15:24.360* :  are concerned about their livelihoods and their ability to pay their mortgages and make a living.
*15:24.500- 15:30.340* :  With this much cheaper Ukrainian grain which is flooding into the Polish market and beyond,
*15:31.260- 15:35.880* :  they're obviously backed by certain political groups and also backed by
*15:36.360- 15:41.860* :  Poland's small nationalist and far-right groups that they are voicing their demands and those
*15:41.860- 15:48.020* :  demands are being heard. There was a national strike by Polish farmers on Friday last week
*15:48.020- 15:53.440* :  in more than 250 locations, they blocked roads and officials responded, and yeah, well,
*15:53.500- 16:00.200* :  we want to help Ukraine, but we won't do it at the expense of our farmers.
*16:00.560- 16:04.420* :  And how challenging is that balance for the government of the relatively new prime minister,
*16:04.420- 16:09.920* :  Donald Tusk, between maintaining strong support for Ukraine, but dealing with those domestic
*16:09.920- 16:15.140* :  pressures as well, because on one level they seem contradictory. They are contradictory,
*16:15.200- 16:20.800* :  and this is difficult for Donald Tusk. Of course, he's a former European council president.
*16:20.860- 16:26.960* :  He's been visiting Paris today and he's been speaking with a man on Macron and he's mentioned
*16:26.960- 16:33.740* :  this. Food security in Poland and in the EU is important farmers are protesting in countries
*16:33.740- 16:40.380* :  right across the European Union, and this has already made the European Commission step back
*16:40.380- 16:44.140* :  in terms of some of the more stringent regulations they'd like to impose.
*16:44.700- 16:49.800* :  Adam Eastern. Next, we're going to El Salvador. Days after the country's president,
*16:49.800- 16:55.760* :  Nei Bukhela was reelected, the BBC has been granted rare access to a mega-prison there
*16:56.320- 16:59.820* :  that's become a symbol of his controversial war against gang violence.
*17:00.540- 17:05.200* :  The government says the center for the confinement of terrorism, as it calls it,
*17:05.620- 17:11.100* :  can hold up to 40,000 inmates, and as part of its hardline approach has no outdoor recreational
*17:11.660- 17:16.660* :  space. BBC Mundo's Leira Ventas told my colleague Nula MacGovan about her visit.
*17:17.100- 17:21.720* :  This is a huge compound built from scratch in the middle of nowhere in a rural area,
*17:21.720- 17:28.280* :  70 kilometers away from the capital city, and it's the size of seven football fields and it's
*17:28.280- 17:35.620* :  formed by 80 units, like eight independent prisons. We went inside one of those units, the third
*17:35.880- 17:42.860* :  unit. The artificial lights never go out. There's a huge corridor in the middle and the cells
*17:42.860- 17:49.040* :  on the sides. Inside the cells, inmates, they are not allowed to leave the cells, just 30 minutes
*17:49.040- 17:54.380* :  a day. There's no outside recreation. Visits are not allowed, not funcals allowed.
*17:55.080- 18:02.360* :  So they slip inside the cells on metal plates. They eat inside the cells with their hands,
*18:03.260- 18:08.880* :  rice and beans and eggs and pasta. They wash themselves. They use a toilet inside the cells.
*18:09.600- 18:16.220* :  That's the situation there. So that begins to give you an idea of what it's like inside that
*18:16.220- 18:24.000* :  prison. But this prison is important when it comes to President Bukhela's security policy.
*18:24.000- 18:29.900* :  Can you explain to us how? Yeah, this prison is emblematic of Bukhela's security policy.
*18:31.080- 18:35.200* :  His controversial security policy, but at the same time, the security policy that has granted
*18:35.200- 18:41.620* :  him the huge popularity, the unprecedented popularity he has and the success in the polls he
*18:41.620- 18:49.100* :  wanted. He was related with the 82.6 percent of the votes. So this prison, as we said, is emblematic
*18:49.100- 18:55.980* :  and emblematic of its main tool, the state of exception that has been enforced for two years now.
*18:56.680- 19:02.180* :  Around 70,000 people have been detained under these measures than that grant
*19:03.020- 19:07.880* :  draconian powers to the police and the military. And El Salvador has now the highest
*19:08.400- 19:11.680* :  incarceration rate in the world. Later event as reporting.

*19:41.220- 19:46.680* :  Who were the black 14? 14 football players who were at University of Wyoming in 1969.
*19:46.700- 19:53.020* :  14 student athletes who paid a heavy price for planning a show of support against racism.
*19:53.740- 19:56.660* :  You hit the campus like wildfire. Some of them were getting death threats.

*20:49.920- 20:52.380* :  Hello again and welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*20:53.120- 20:58.000* :  Now police in Delhi have banned all public gatherings ahead of a threatened march on
*20:58.000- 21:01.680* :  India's capital on Tuesday by thousands of protesting farmers.
*21:02.280- 21:07.700* :  Security forces have been deployed and concrete barricades erected on roads into Delhi from
*21:07.700- 21:13.320* :  neighbouring states. Farmers are demanding greater protections including guaranteed minimum crop
*21:13.320- 21:16.520* :  prices. From Delhi, here's Nitin Srivastuf.
*21:16.740- 21:23.880* :  India's capital is preparing again for a massive farmers protest. This happened only two years back
*21:24.260- 21:28.500* :  when hundreds and thousands of farmers had laid siege to borders in Delhi.
*21:29.380- 21:34.640* :  Bordering states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were sealed. Traffic was disrupted.
*21:35.740- 21:40.800* :  The farmers were demanding repeal of farm laws passed by the government in 2020.
*21:42.080- 21:49.060* :  Now they plan to start protesting again from the 13th of February and the demands are same.
*21:49.640- 21:56.080* :  The farmers want the government to guarantee a minimum support price for their annual yield of crops.
*21:56.820- 22:03.680* :  They also want pensions to the farmers and 200 unions across the country also want
*22:03.680- 22:11.660* :  better working conditions and better promotion of their crops in terms of foreign imports and
*22:11.660- 22:17.480* :  exports. What's important to be remembered, the government had repealed the laws in 2021
*22:17.480- 22:23.680* :  after India's top court had intervened. But the farmers say nothing much has changed while
*22:23.680- 22:29.840* :  the government says it is going to be in negotiations with the farmer to avoid a confrontation.
*22:30.180- 22:36.860* :  Meanwhile, the capital Delhi has banned all positions. Weddings and funders will need special
*22:36.860- 22:41.260* :  permission for the government for at least one month. Traffic advisories have been issued.
*22:41.260- 22:49.060* :  The farmers are really adamant. Now citizens of Delhi and the joining areas are really
*22:50.620- 22:55.280* :  bothered as to what the next month is going to be like if that happens again.
*22:56.000- 22:59.260* :  Nitin Srivastav reporting from the streets of Delhi.
*23:00.160- 23:04.440* :  On New Year's Day, a devastating earthquake shook Japan's remote to Nottal Peninsula,
*23:04.440- 23:10.240* :  killing more than 200 people. About 55,000 houses were destroyed or badly damaged.
*23:11.020- 23:16.060* :  The BBC Shama Khalil has returned to the area to investigate the extent of the devastation
*23:16.460- 23:19.960* :  and also see how slowly the relief operation appears to be running.
*23:24.220- 23:26.420* :  Yuriko Momichi has a new routine these days.
*23:27.900- 23:33.200* :  The 82-year-old Oyster farmer has been collecting rainwater from down the hill next to her home
*23:33.200- 23:38.660* :  in the tiny remote village of Mogigawara. The village is in the Nottal Peninsula,
*23:38.660- 23:44.440* :  one of the most remote areas in central Japan. It's where the 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit
*23:44.440- 23:47.220* :  on New Year's Day. Like tens of thousands in the area,
*23:47.700- 23:50.460* :  Umamichi-san has been without running water for more than four weeks,
*23:51.300- 23:55.100* :  and this bucket of rainwater she now carries is the only way to wash and clean.
*24:01.040- 24:02.760* :  This has been my daily life since the earthquake.
*24:03.460- 24:06.020* :  Aid, including food and drinking water, has been coming in,
*24:06.600- 24:10.480* :  but it's been slow because of how remote the Nottal Peninsula is and because of the level
*24:10.480- 24:15.720* :  of damage to the roads. Many of the affected areas were cut off for days. The main water pipes
*24:15.720- 24:21.960* :  have also ruptured and fixing them will take time. Inside, we sit on the floor in Umamichi-san's
*24:21.960- 24:28.320* :  living room, huddled near the gas stove. It's freezing after days of snow, and she insists on
*24:28.320- 24:33.520* :  making cups of hot coffee for the whole team. She's in good spirits, but it's been a very difficult
*24:33.520- 24:40.000* :  start to the year. In the past few weeks, at least once a day, there'd be aftershocks.
*24:40.640- 24:45.460* :  We've begun to get used to it. I need to get used to this life. We had no electricity for half
*24:45.460- 24:50.720* :  a month and it was pitch black. There are less than 40 households here in Mugi-gaura.
*24:51.320- 24:56.200* :  Unlike the wrecked old wooden homes around her, hers is still intact, but it's been deemed too
*24:56.200- 25:00.800* :  dangerous to live in. There is a red notice on her front door that reads unsafe in English and
*25:00.800- 25:06.160* :  Japanese. Many of the homes around the village have the same red sheet of paper, but Umamichi-san
*25:06.160- 25:11.360* :  says she won't leave. We're now driving closer to the epicenter. It's a long and slow drive.
*25:11.420- 25:16.260* :  The Japanese defense forces have been bringing in aid and helping with the rescue efforts in the area.
*25:18.220- 25:24.080* :  Walking through this residential street here in Wajima or what remains of it, it's very hard to
*25:24.080- 25:32.680* :  make out the homes. They now feel like just one big pile of rubble. Taichi Kirimoto is a seventh
*25:32.680- 25:36.940* :  generation traditional lecher artist and craftsman born and raised in Wajima.
*25:39.120- 25:43.240* :  He takes us to the town's morning market when the earthquake hit a fire broke out here,
*25:43.680- 25:48.100* :  what's been spared by the fire was destroyed in the devastating tremors and aftershocks.
*25:48.820- 25:53.700* :  We stand in front of the mangled metal structures which used to be stalls and Mr. Kirimoto points
*25:53.700- 26:03.980* :  to his destroyed studio and shop. I can't put into words how I feel. This is the street of my
*26:03.980- 26:11.840* :  childhood. How long do you think it's going to take to restore all of this? First of all we need
*26:11.840- 26:17.800* :  help getting water running again. We need the sewage system to be working again and then people can
*26:17.800- 26:26.200* :  think about returning. For craftsmen to start work again we need running water. Mr. Kirimoto is
*26:26.200- 26:32.240* :  anxious about the future of his town. It'll take a long time for Wajima to get back to normal,
*26:33.060- 26:37.200* :  but the deep sense of loss for its people will linger here for much longer.
*26:39.280- 26:45.360* :  Shima Kellial reporting from Japan. Now let's stay in Asia because traffic jams are the latest
*26:45.360- 26:51.020* :  issue to cause debating Thailand about the country's draconian laws that protect its royal family
*26:51.020- 26:57.280* :  from any public criticism. The Thai Prime Minister Shreta Tavisin has ordered tighter security for
*26:57.280- 27:03.700* :  royal family motorcades. After an argument earlier this month led to a brawl between ultra-loyalists
*27:03.700- 27:09.420* :  and monarchy reformers. Fifth Marsh has more. The blaring of an activist's car horn at the royal
*27:09.420- 27:15.920* :  motorcade was described in one Thai news outlet as a brazen offence, a defiant honk that echoed far
*27:15.920- 27:21.540* :  beyond the expressways of Bangkok. The activist life streamed herself on social media arguing with
*27:21.540- 27:26.760* :  the police who were holding up traffic for the convoy. Local reporter Seterkar tried to overtake
*27:26.760- 27:32.120* :  the motorcade. The monarchy in Thailand is widely revered, insulting it can mean prison.
*27:32.700- 27:37.460* :  Ultra-royalists, angered by the incident, clashed with reformists on Saturday at a station,
*27:37.460- 27:44.480* :  more than a dozen people were injured. Fifth Marsh, now this is a lovely listen to end on.
*27:50.640- 27:56.320* :  To a different era far away from the current wars and disputes, that's is the sound of the
*27:56.320- 28:02.460* :  jazz age, the roaring 20s, and George Gershwin's rhapsody in blue. It had its premiere in New York
*28:02.460- 28:08.720* :  100 years ago yesterday, the 12th of February, 1924. The Russian composer, Igor Stravinsky,
*28:08.720- 28:14.420* :  himself was there for the performance. He'd shocked the classical world a decade before with his
*28:14.420- 28:19.360* :  right of spring. For more on this, James Notty spoke to the pianist, Julian Joseph.
*28:27.320- 28:33.880* :  The opening of rhapsody in blue was a sort of jazz ensemble invention in a way, because the clarinetist
*28:33.880- 28:44.520* :  just decided to put a big lissando on it, as you feel that freedom in that jazz environment
*28:44.540- 28:50.940* :  to be able to do something like that. And also, Gershwin improvised most of the cadenzes,
*28:51.320- 28:52.240* :  if not all of them.
*29:00.680- 29:05.420* :  And then wrote them out to be played after that, after that first performance.
*29:11.520- 29:18.880* :  Looking back on it from this distance, where does this piece sit in the story of a fusion of a
*29:18.880- 29:21.740* :  kind of jazz vocabulary with a classical tradition?
*29:22.600- 29:27.700* :  It sort of comes at a time when there was the jazz zeitgeist in America.
*29:32.980- 29:40.060* :  The roaring 20s is known as the jazz age, and I think rhapsody in blue in a funny way sort of
*29:40.680- 29:50.080* :  defines that era as a composition that combines this African-American music into the sort of
*29:50.080- 29:52.200* :  classical format.
*30:01.040- 30:04.720* :  And it just became something of a musical whirlwind.
*30:05.280- 30:09.600* :  Gershwin was only 25 when he wrote it, he wrote it extraordinarily quickly.
*30:10.300- 30:14.820* :  He talked about it being a kaleidoscope of America. I think they got the idea on a train going
*30:14.820- 30:17.920* :  from New York to Boston, listening to the rattling on the rails.
*30:22.780- 30:24.520* :  What is the nature of Gershwin's genius?
*30:25.600- 30:29.600* :  Well, he's just one of those special people that comes along every once in a while, who
*30:30.240- 30:34.900* :  really captures the sound of something and is able to put it in many forms.
*30:35.400- 30:40.540* :  He seemed to really grasp the essence and the roots of the jazz sound, the blues.
*30:40.740- 30:46.960* :  But that's because he came up amongst jazz musicians, and it doesn't come from him sort of dipping
*30:46.960- 30:53.820* :  into it a little bit. He really was a jazz person. He could figure things out himself,
*30:54.440- 30:56.140* :  and then really get the essence of it.
*30:56.440- 31:01.460* :  And he had this wonderful knack for a tune, and those stand a test of time.
*31:01.460- 31:05.820* :  And I mean, a piece like Summa Time is something we're all aware of.
*31:15.700- 31:22.220* :  But in jazz music, a piece like I got rhythm is something that a lot of other tunes are based on,
*31:22.220- 31:22.980* :  just the forms.
*31:29.200- 31:38.600* :  Gershwin was able to sink into a vocabulary, which was much more associated with black jazz men.
*31:39.840- 31:44.420* :  And yet he seemed perfectly at home there. It wasn't a problem.
*31:44.720- 31:50.620* :  I think society has always been more comfortable with promoting white people doing black things,
*31:50.620- 31:55.380* :  than black people doing black things. So if you take Gershwin as an example,
*31:55.380- 32:00.960* :  opportunities that he would be given, society was much happier to do that with him,
*32:00.960- 32:06.400* :  rather than with, say, Art Tatum, or James P. Johnson or Willie the Lion Smith. That's the
*32:06.400- 32:13.120* :  nub of it. I think anybody who loves a black art is not doing it to steal it and produce it
*32:13.520- 32:18.200* :  as their own. The artist isn't trying to do that. Society is trying to do that.
*32:26.700- 32:28.660* :  The thoughts of the jazz pianist, Julian Joseph.
*32:31.540- 32:35.580* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
