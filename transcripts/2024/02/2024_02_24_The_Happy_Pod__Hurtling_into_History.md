*01:46.340- 01:49.080* :  This is The Happy Pod from the BBC World Service.
*01:54.020- 01:58.320* :  I'm Jackie Lennard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 24th of February,
*01:58.320- 02:03.500* :  heartling into history, Africa's first Bob Slade champion breaking more records.
*02:04.120- 02:07.840* :  Not only am I breaking this barrier and making this history but really just
*02:08.200- 02:11.720* :  compete with the rest of the world, that for me it would be success.
*02:11.720- 02:17.620* :  The Spanish football club doing its bits to encourage players and fans to be more environmentally friendly.
*02:18.080- 02:27.800* :  For Green is the platform launched by Real Betis for inspiring society for fighting against climate change.
*02:27.820- 02:35.680* :  Also in this podcast, we definitely has only child syndrome. He is a local celebrity and he
*02:35.860- 02:38.940* :  writes a column for our local newspaper.
*02:38.980- 02:43.420* :  A surprising therapist, celebrity and columnist in the Florida Keys,
*02:43.880- 02:47.700* :  and the viral social media post that wasn't quite what it seemed.
*02:47.700- 02:52.920* :  This was very unintentional, it was a late night coast for me, it was all in good fun,
*02:52.920- 02:56.480* :  it was all as somebody coined recently Kitterbanter.
*03:02.180- 03:07.580* :  Hurtling down narrow, twisted, packed ice tracks in a gravity powered sled
*03:07.940- 03:12.040* :  might not be everyone's first choice in sporting endeavour, but then Nigeria's
*03:12.040- 03:19.160* :  Cimidelae Adi Agbo isn't everyone. In 2018 she became the first Nigerian to compete at the Winter
*03:19.160- 03:23.360* :  Olympics and became the first black female Olympian in the sport of skeleton.
*03:23.960- 03:27.800* :  Now the Bob Slay World Championships are underway in Vinterburg in Germany.
*03:27.800- 03:33.520* :  The same place where two years ago Cimidelae became the first African to win a World Cup race
*03:33.860- 03:37.840* :  when she claimed the Mono Bob title, and she's looking forward to her next challenge.
*03:47.480- 03:53.620* :  I feel a great privilege, first of all, for the opportunity to take this huge step forward for
*03:53.620- 03:59.560* :  not only Nigeria, but for the continent of Africa. The IBSF, the International Bob Sled and
*03:59.560- 04:06.540* :  Skeleton Federation has just celebrated 100 years of existence, and in that century there has
*04:06.540- 04:13.000* :  been no African athlete in Bob Sled that is competed at the World Championship. So it took a whole
*04:13.000- 04:19.000* :  century to break this barrier, and so for me I feel very privileged and honored to be the one
*04:19.000- 04:25.080* :  that has this opportunity to do this on the world stage and I'm very proud to be representing Nigeria
*04:25.080- 04:32.520* :  in the continent of Africa. So I really just want to just show up for the country and the continent
*04:32.520- 04:38.420* :  to really show that not only am I breaking this barrier and making this history but really just
*04:38.980- 04:44.520* :  compete with the rest of the world. So I'm happy for me, it would be success. I've had to just
*04:45.280- 04:50.560* :  overcome so many barriers just to get here, but I'm here and now it's just time to show the world
*04:50.560- 05:02.040* :  what Nigerians can do. While the landscape continues to grow, I think in small ways, I think
*05:02.040- 05:08.140* :  the bar has been set in terms of different examples that we can pull from to show that it's possible.
*05:08.840- 05:15.780* :  Not only myself, but my teammates that I made history with back in 2018, in 2022, Nigeria had
*05:16.100- 05:21.180* :  representation at the Beijing Olympics with a ski athlete, and even when you look at the Uth Olympics
*05:21.180- 05:27.260* :  that just took place a few weeks ago in Pyeongchang, there was a Nigerian curling team. So
*05:27.600- 05:33.280* :  we are seeing some small steps forward, but I'm hopeful that the investment will be made
*05:33.880- 05:40.340* :  for it on the continent of Africa. I think it's going to take a very intentional plan and a strategic
*05:40.340- 05:50.620* :  plan for it to be sustainable going forward. Nigeria's Simadele Adiagbo will be competing next weekend
*05:50.620- 05:56.740* :  and staying with a sporting theme moves to make Spanish football more environmentally friendly.
*05:57.100- 06:03.020* :  Our reporter Ashish Sharma has been to see what Real Batisse is doing to encourage a greener
*06:03.020- 06:09.080* :  approach from players, coaches and fans. When it comes to football, this is not a sport we
*06:09.080- 06:13.740* :  associate with being environmentally friendly. Large squads flying around the world,
*06:13.740- 06:20.020* :  players on private jets, even fans who follow their team everywhere. But as with all things in life,
*06:20.020- 06:21.220* :  there are exceptions.
*06:32.880- 06:42.880* :  For Green is the platform launched by Real Batisse for disseminating an inspiring society
*06:42.880- 06:49.220* :  for fighting against climate change. The La Liga Club Royal Batisse are green pioneers here in
*06:49.220- 06:55.360* :  Spain. I'm standing outside the newly built Ciudad de Bordiva Rafael Gordillo. It's a training
*06:55.360- 07:00.980* :  complex and everything on the other side of the gate from where I'm standing is completely carbon neutral.
*07:03.820- 07:09.860* :  The club permits no use of plastic in training and players are assigned glass bottles of water.
*07:10.400- 07:15.720* :  Only bicycles and electric vehicles are used, but style players like Ayosepereth
*07:16.060- 07:21.740* :  has brought in to the forever green ideas. We are, how could I say, a big boy that
*07:22.740- 07:29.180* :  gets to many places. So we got the platform to help and make people involved as well.
*07:29.600- 07:35.300* :  There are always fans waiting for autographs once the players finish and I'm lucky enough to be
*07:35.300- 07:40.820* :  joined by two of them. So at the beginning they start playing with the forever green logo in the
*07:40.820- 07:48.260* :  chest. So I thought that it was a new sponsor, but then when I saw the club doing a lot of initiatives
*07:48.260- 07:54.260* :  related with sustainability, I thought okay it's not a sponsor, I think it's anything else is
*07:54.260- 08:00.480* :  something more. I'm very proud of my team. Last match I came by bike, but only if they were
*08:00.480- 08:08.780* :  the least good. That's true because if it's raining we try to come by car, but I'm always sharing
*08:08.780- 08:14.800* :  car. We have one player that he used to come to their training facilities by bike, so yeah,
*08:14.800- 08:21.000* :  they have their mentality too. That report from Ashishama in Spain. The idea of therapy
*08:21.000- 08:26.380* :  animals isn't a new one, well-trained, friendly dogs are welcome visitors in many a school,
*08:26.380- 08:32.240* :  retirement home and healthcare setting, not to mention podcast studio, but when Nicole Navarro
*08:32.240- 08:38.020* :  from the Florida Keys in the US encountered and took in foxes surrendered by fur farms,
*08:38.560- 08:42.980* :  she realized they could provide a different sort of comfort to people who had been through
*08:42.980- 08:48.420* :  trauma themselves. She told us more about them. They were a little traumatized and confused,
*08:48.780- 08:54.960* :  so once I formed this bond with them I just became very intrigued about what it would take to
*08:54.960- 09:02.580* :  start rescuing foxes that were being saved from the fur trade, and then in 2020 that dream
*09:02.660- 09:10.980* :  became a reality. So I reached out to the women's only mental health facility, and I just pitched
*09:10.980- 09:18.520* :  the idea of bringing one of my tamer foxes in there and sharing their story of survival from
*09:18.520- 09:25.240* :  fur farm to freedom, and they were all for it. And then the Florida Keys children shelter reached
*09:25.240- 09:32.480* :  out to me, and it has really taken off. You very kindly sent us some video, and I think
*09:32.480- 09:38.740* :  you would agree with me that the sound that the foxes make does not necessarily chime with what
*09:38.740- 09:52.180* :  people would think of as a therapeutic sound. Yeah, no, yeah, they only make those sounds for me,
*09:52.180- 10:02.140* :  lucky me. The most vocal fox is reef. He is the first fox I got as a baby, so he definitely has
*10:02.140- 10:12.760* :  only child syndrome, and now he is a local celebrity, and he writes a column for our local newspaper
*10:12.760- 10:22.320* :  The Keys Weekly every week, so he does. He does. Yes, he does. It's a very popular
*10:22.320- 10:29.100* :  column that people get upset if for some reason they have to bump him one week to make space,
*10:29.560- 10:35.780* :  and it's really just a sign of how support of our community has been as a whole. I really can't
*10:35.780- 10:43.320* :  imagine being with these foxes anywhere else in the world. So what is their life like now?
*10:43.960- 10:50.360* :  Like obviously feed them a proper diet. They get above average veterinary care. I would say they
*10:50.360- 10:56.020* :  have better health care than I do. You know, I give them enrichment. They get toys. They get places
*10:56.020- 11:03.220* :  to dig and den since we are in South Florida. They all have access to air conditioning and some capacity.
*11:04.600- 11:11.400* :  So they definitely have all settled into the island life as I call it.
*11:11.820- 11:16.520* :  And you obviously will have had lots of feedback from both children and from the women that you
*11:16.520- 11:22.340* :  have introduced your foxes to. What have they said to you about what those interactions mean to them?
*11:22.720- 11:30.000* :  The women really resonate with the fact that regardless of species, with the right set of
*11:30.000- 11:36.780* :  circumstances, the right environment and the right people cheering you on, you can go on to live
*11:36.780- 11:43.500* :  a very full and purposeful life that your past does not have to define your future. And when the
*11:43.500- 11:50.900* :  children come, the children shelter rings the children to us. The children I hear always say it
*11:50.900- 11:56.720* :  makes them feel very special. You know, and I start to tear up when I think about it because some of
*11:56.720- 12:04.280* :  the children I know they're very painful backgrounds, but they say that when they're with the foxes,
*12:04.280- 12:11.600* :  they just feel like the foxes accept them for who they are. And, you know, I think especially with
*12:11.600- 12:17.460* :  the children who are a lot of times going to foster care and they just need a place to come where
*12:17.460- 12:26.840* :  they can just relax and not feel any sort of pressure to be anything but a child. And they resonate
*12:26.840- 12:32.880* :  with the foxes because that's the environment I provide for the foxes. I allow the foxes to be
*12:32.880- 12:37.880* :  exactly who they want to be. You know, I don't force them to do anything. So I think when the
*12:37.880- 12:45.660* :  children see that a life like that is possible, it gives them hope. Nicole Navarro.
*12:50.580- 12:56.100* :  Still to come in this podcast, discovering another thing that people have in common with orangutans.
*12:56.600- 13:02.600* :  The more bridges we build to connect us with our closest living relatives, the better we will
*13:02.600- 13:05.860* :  understand our own nature and our place in it.
*13:32.300- 13:39.060* :  What would be your ideal murder mystery partner? A very simple crime. A crime with no complications,
*13:39.380- 13:45.860* :  a crime that was unimpassionate and team. Search for BBC audio wherever you purchase audiobooks and

*13:51.500- 13:58.260* :  In 1969, a plan to show support for an anti-racism protest turned the lives of 14 promising
*13:58.260- 14:05.140* :  black student athletes upside down. I don't think we realized what the true flavor of Wyoming
*14:05.140- 14:11.380* :  was back in 1969. Amazing sport stories from the BBC World Service tells the story of the black
*14:11.380- 14:17.560* :  14. There was a rebel, Confederate flag being flown. It was different. It was definitely different.

*14:23.220- 14:27.840* :  Now, a couple of other things that caught our eye in recent days, the organizers of the London
*14:27.840- 14:31.740* :  Marathon have announced that this year's event will be the first global marathon to have
*14:31.740- 14:36.780* :  equal prize money for wheelchair and able-bodied athletes. The London Marathon already had
*14:36.780- 14:42.060* :  the highest prize money for elite wheelchair races. Congratulations to a singer who has become
*14:42.060- 14:47.780* :  the first black woman to top the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the US. The single is
*14:47.780- 14:52.980* :  called Texas Holdham and is the work of an up-and-coming country star known as Beyoncé.
*14:53.620- 14:59.440* :  And a highland games trophy missing for almost 90 years has returned home after being rediscovered
*14:59.440- 15:05.400* :  in England. It was last won at the Cabrack picnic and games in the 1930s by Charles Taylor,
*15:05.700- 15:10.540* :  a man described as a brilliant athlete, as well as a fine musician, being particularly talented
*15:10.540- 15:16.820* :  at the backpipes. It will now go to a new winner. And from that and other seamless segue into this,
*15:16.820- 15:18.380* :  do you recognise this language?
*15:27.420- 15:34.040* :  God it is Scottish Gallic, a language spoken by an estimated 60,000 also people. As we record
*15:34.040- 15:39.320* :  this podcast, World Gallic Week is drawing to a close. It's an event to celebrate the
*15:39.320- 15:44.520* :  Scots language, not only in Scotland, but around the world too. And it was the idea of one of our
*15:44.520- 15:50.560* :  colleagues, BBC Weather presenter Joy Dunlop, who works on BBC Scotland and BBC Alba,
*15:50.840- 15:55.080* :  forecasting in English and Gallic. I grew up singing in Gallic,
*15:55.080- 15:59.640* :  kicker up, playing traditional music, and then I learned Gallic as a second language,
*16:00.120- 16:04.060* :  and second to school before doing a full immersion degree. So I came from it in a bit more
*16:04.540- 16:09.320* :  of a slightly different route to maybe some who are lucky enough to speak it from birth.
*16:09.600- 16:13.600* :  And the fact that there is now a World Gallic Week and there are events taking place,
*16:13.880- 16:18.940* :  I mean, all over the world, I think Australia, Canada, is this the Scottish diaspora,
*16:18.940- 16:22.820* :  these people who had nothing to do with Scotland, but are turning to the language purely out of
*16:22.820- 16:29.540* :  interest? I think it's a bit of both to be honest. I mean, we definitely have a wonderfully
*16:29.540- 16:33.780* :  strong diaspora community. People remember their routes and they feel very Scottish,
*16:34.380- 16:37.500* :  through whatever they are throughout the world, and they're very passionate about that.
*16:38.080- 16:45.540* :  But also, we have a really thriving online community of learners that are, I guess,
*16:45.720- 16:50.500* :  particularly from around lockdown, it was the one silver lining of lockdown that actually people
*16:50.500- 16:55.320* :  had a bit more time to learn languages, and we saw that Gallic in particular and had a huge
*16:55.380- 17:01.120* :  research in through three learning tools like Jolingo, the Speak Gallic course,
*17:01.600- 17:05.520* :  and I think actually you're really seeing now how people are bringing the language into their
*17:05.520- 17:11.860* :  lives, and that geographical barrier that perhaps might have been there beforehand isn't now.
*17:11.860- 17:15.920* :  So our language, our culture has been celebrated throughout the globe, but I just think that's
*17:15.920- 17:23.460* :  a wonderful thing. It's the initial barrier quite high for an English speaker, because the sounds
*17:23.460- 17:31.020* :  of the syllables and the words seem so different. I think it's interesting, because in practically
*17:31.020- 17:35.720* :  any other country in the world, you're speaking more than one language is very normal. So I think
*17:35.720- 17:39.220* :  that's actually the biggest barrier that we're just not used to learning in the same way.
*17:39.420- 17:43.740* :  If you're a Scottish, a lot of the sounds are in there, the sounds, the gears, the news,
*17:43.740- 17:49.220* :  we've got that anyway, that's in our Scottish speech, but actually I think the difference is
*17:49.620- 17:54.540* :  it's not a Roman's language. So when you come to it, speaking English, you may be
*17:54.540- 17:58.920* :  expect it to have the same sentence structure, you may be expect it to have this in grammar, it
*17:58.920- 18:05.560* :  doesn't, but actually I think Gallic is a much much easier language to learn than English. I
*18:06.020- 18:10.840* :  take my hat off to anybody who manages to learn English, because actually it's a lot more
*18:10.840- 18:16.640* :  regular when you start to to learn the sounds and the spelling, whereas Gallic is very,
*18:16.640- 18:21.940* :  very regular, it falls apart and it's just so beautiful to listen to it. Has that
*18:22.600- 18:27.200* :  malicious sound to it? There's a sing song in it, the rise and fall. I think if you can track
*18:27.200- 18:32.340* :  into that, it's just such a beautiful language. It's really tight. It's in the heritage.
*18:32.340- 18:37.100* :  Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Joy Dunlop, how do I say thank you to you in Gallic?
*18:37.640- 18:44.640* :  You see, tough belief. Tough belief. Thank you so much. Perfect. Joy Dunlop was talking to
*18:44.640- 18:48.880* :  Michelle Hussein and it did make us wonder about other languages that listeners speak,
*18:48.880- 18:54.300* :  that might be rare, but are still worth preserving, celebrating and indeed speaking. Do let us
*18:54.300- 19:01.720* :  know the usual address, global podcast at BBC.co.uk. And it turns out that something we thought was
*19:01.720- 19:07.800* :  unique to human language, isn't? In a study of wild orangutans in Indonesian Borneo,
*19:08.340- 19:13.720* :  long calls were recorded and the researchers tried to track the rhythm and acoustic features
*19:14.320- 19:20.240* :  and they discovered something a bit unexpected. The study was led by primatologist Adriana Lamiara
*19:20.640- 19:23.120* :  of the University of Warwick. This isn't him.
*19:30.600- 19:37.980* :  We discovered a way of combining calls that we so far thought it was unique to language
*19:37.980- 19:46.120* :  and to humans. This operation is called recursion and it's simply this idea that you can
*19:47.000- 19:53.520* :  put a signal inside another signal that is of a similar kind. So, for example,
*19:54.460- 20:02.500* :  if I'm talking and I insert the phrase to, for example, elaborate an explanation or provide more
*20:02.500- 20:09.060* :  detail and then I continue my original phrase. When you say that, you mean something like
*20:09.060- 20:14.280* :  the cat which had eaten the ham was asleep on the sofa and the bit about the ham
*20:14.580- 20:22.160* :  is the extra sequence inside the longer sequence. Precisely. And so that's what brings extraordinary,
*20:22.340- 20:28.720* :  expressive richness to language because we can keep on elaborating and offering depth
*20:29.360- 20:34.180* :  and that was exactly the pattern that we found that while the orangutans are doing.
*20:34.940- 20:41.020* :  So, what does it mean when an orangutan does it? What does this style of communication do?
*20:41.020- 20:46.580* :  What does it achieve for the orangutans you've been observing? So, it's a patterning that orangutan
*20:46.580- 20:54.680* :  males are using in their advertisement calls to attract mates and discourage other males to come
*20:55.060- 21:00.300* :  to in their vicinity. So, it's something that the males do when they're trying to show off,
*21:00.300- 21:08.600* :  basically. Correct. Yes. Okay. So, were you surprised by this discovery? Yes and no.
*21:09.320- 21:15.580* :  Yes, because theory told us that we shouldn't be expecting this in any of the primate species.
*21:16.440- 21:21.480* :  On the other hand, we can only theorize and predict things that we have thought about.
*21:22.240- 21:28.880* :  But in many cases, we haven't put in enough research effort to actually describe and characterize
*21:28.880- 21:36.900* :  what these animals are doing in the wild. And so, in that sense, at first we were very excited about
*21:36.900- 21:43.400* :  the finding and then thinking about it was like, well, maybe that was to be expected because
*21:43.400- 21:48.760* :  actually no one had ever looked for these patterns because everyone assumed they were not there.
*21:49.420- 21:54.100* :  And so, does that mean that it probably isn't just us in the orangutan, some of the other
*21:54.100- 21:59.660* :  primates might do it too? Oh, absolutely. I believe that the more research effort we're going to
*21:59.900- 22:06.460* :  invest, the more we're going to discover that primates and grade apes will have way more
*22:06.460- 22:14.400* :  parallels to our own behavior than we sometimes get to admit. It kind of makes me remember this idea
*22:14.400- 22:20.740* :  that not too long ago, we assumed ourselves to be the only tool users in the animal kingdom.
*22:21.380- 22:26.560* :  And now turns out that there are thousands of examples including vertebrates and fishes.
*22:27.580- 22:32.640* :  The whole animal kingdom is using tools and to believe that for centuries we thought we were
*22:32.640- 22:39.660* :  the only ones. And I think the more bridges we built to connect us with our past and with our
*22:40.000- 22:46.100* :  closest living relatives, the better we will understand our own nature and in our place in it.
*22:46.920- 22:53.700* :  Primatologist Adriano Lamera, now to Tanzania. The man known as the flying chef,
*22:53.700- 22:59.980* :  caters for a very select and wealthy clientele. And one of his unique selling points is that most of
*22:59.980- 23:04.420* :  his staff grew up on the streets of Erucia. Rachel Wright reports.
*23:06.360- 23:13.120* :  On Tia House is a luxury lodge development which is sort of nestled amongst the tropical trees
*23:13.120- 23:20.560* :  on the side of the hill, overlooking the northern city of Erucia. And most of the people that are
*23:20.560- 23:27.060* :  employed in this large, beautiful complex of chalets and bungalows are former street children of Erucia.
*23:30.340- 23:36.120* :  The kitchen at ONCEA House produces Michelin quality food. In a sense here is one of the main
*23:36.120- 23:44.220* :  waitresses, but she grew up on the street. In the streets there I was just hanging around doing
*23:44.220- 23:54.880* :  nothing at home, one meal per day, no money at all. So I was feeling so bad, so bad, but I was just
*23:55.260- 24:01.700* :  encouraging myself that one day I can reach somewhere to afford for the survival.
*24:02.400- 24:08.200* :  Through an NGO called Jobortunity which helps poor families, she got placed at ONCEA House as a
*24:08.200- 24:14.220* :  waitress. Actually my life changed from hanging around the street and coming to the
*24:14.220- 24:20.780* :  place where I can achieve something in the life. And you are smiling a lot all the time,
*24:20.780- 24:26.680* :  I say you are smiling. Thank you. This is because I have something to be proud of,
*24:26.820- 24:34.080* :  something make me happy. My comfort zone is my job now. And the man to whom Inesensia says she
*24:34.080- 24:40.000* :  owes her life is Axel Jansson's, a top chef from Belgium who together with his cousin set up
*24:40.000- 24:45.060* :  ONCEA House. A lot of them are actually people that we take from the street and that we train during
*24:45.300- 24:54.400* :  a minimum of 3 years in our kitchen. 80% of the trainees are making it. I am super proud of them.
*24:54.580- 25:01.180* :  5 years ago I had back surgery and I couldn't be here for 2-3 months and they kept the place
*25:01.180- 25:07.140* :  fully alive and beautiful. Axel is known as the Flying Chef because not only does he cook for the
*25:07.140- 25:12.780* :  restaurant, he is also flown around Africa cooking in unusual places for billionaires and he takes
*25:12.780- 25:23.220* :  his deputy, Baraka, who grew up on the streets with him. Out in the car park, Baraka is preparing
*25:23.220- 25:28.780* :  a huge trailer to drive to the middle of the bush and cook for 13 people. He told me about an
*25:28.780- 25:34.400* :  earlier trip to the top of Kilimanjaro to which he took 80 people to help carry the equipment.
*25:43.700- 25:48.780* :  Even the pizza we bake in the Kilimanjaro, we have our techniques to make our oven ourselves.
*25:50.040- 25:56.160* :  So how do you feel about your life now because before, is this your truck you are going?
*25:56.160- 25:59.820* :  How do you, oh my god, there's a lot of smoke coming out the back.
*26:00.840- 26:06.640* :  To be honest, I feel very good because now I have my own family now, I have my house, I have
*26:07.120- 26:13.660* :  childrens have two childrens now they are in good school so. So is it like a dream?
*26:14.440- 26:19.180* :  Yeah, it's not like my dream comes true, it's big step for now.
*26:19.860- 26:25.580* :  Rachel Wright was reporting from Arusha. Now to Kiribas, or is it?
*26:26.140- 26:31.360* :  Kiribas is an island nation in the central Pacific Ocean and a few days ago it's
*26:31.360- 26:38.160* :  ex-account or more accurately what looks like its ex-account went viral. Following numbers for
*26:38.160- 26:44.900* :  at Kiribas, Gav went from a few hundred two thousands after it quoted another user who had made
*26:44.900- 26:52.180* :  fun of Kiribas place names like London, Paris, Poland and banana with fine, you're not invited.
*26:52.860- 26:57.740* :  They're followed further playful posts and it looked like a big social media win for
*26:57.740- 27:03.240* :  Kiribas tourism. Except it isn't official. The person who responded when we contacted the
*27:03.240- 27:07.140* :  account was a man who says he was born in Kiribas but now lives in the US.
*27:08.340- 27:16.480* :  My name is Gabyadir Niyaki and this is my second time I guess impersonating the government
*27:16.500- 27:22.180* :  of my homeland, the Republic of Kiribas. I noticed that there was never a
*27:23.240- 27:29.940* :  Twitter active Twitter presence and I just took it out by myself to pretty much copy and paste
*27:29.940- 27:36.840* :  everything that they were doing on Facebook and then Twitter shut it down and then I started
*27:36.840- 27:46.060* :  in my account I think November of last year and I'm assuming you probably saw the viral posts and
*27:46.280- 27:53.300* :  that's how I think blew up. So I did have a little fun with it. I was constantly retweeting any
*27:53.300- 28:01.940* :  articles or any posts that were either informative or positive. I started responding kind of
*28:02.300- 28:07.320* :  sassy or a little bit of snark when I thought I could kind of get away with it.
*28:08.100- 28:14.560* :  Never really to make it go huge and viral like this. This was very unintentional. It was a late
*28:14.560- 28:21.940* :  night post for me. I kind of had just a throw away. It was all really good fun. It was all as
*28:21.940- 28:28.060* :  somebody coined recently. Kitter banter. My people are definitely known for being mischievous
*28:28.060- 28:39.580* :  and tricking each other but never in mean spirits. Even if the hammer falls and it all goes away
*28:39.580- 28:46.260* :  I would like to ultimately think that the little bit of positive exposure brought to my home country
*28:46.260- 28:52.260* :  made it well worth it and at the very least it makes for great stories. To be clear we are not
*28:52.260- 28:57.120* :  condoning cat fishing. We did try to get a comment from the Kiribati government but as we record
*28:57.120- 29:05.560* :  this podcast we haven't heard back yet. And that's it from us for now. Remember if you'd like to
