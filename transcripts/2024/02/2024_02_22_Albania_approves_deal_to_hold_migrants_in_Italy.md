*01:07.760- 01:10.760* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:13.440- 01:18.540* :  I'm Kareishi and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 22nd of February these are our main stories.
*01:19.060- 01:22.800* :  Albania's Parliament ratifies a controversial asylum deal with Italy.
*01:30.260- 01:34.860* :  Also the former Brazilian footballer Danny Alves is jailed in Spain for four and a half years
*01:34.860- 01:42.020* :  for a sex attack. We report from a plane trying to drop aid in Northern Gaza and analysis on Moscow
*01:42.020- 01:47.540* :  as a Russian official looks away when confronted by G20 leaders about the death of Alexey Navalny.
*01:50.700- 01:56.460* :  Also in this podcast, globally they are the leading cause of early deaths that they've overtaken
*01:56.460- 02:03.180* :  tobacco and we need to use a tobacco control approach. Why experts say eating ultra processed foods
*02:03.180- 02:13.700* :  should be seen as similar to smoking cigarettes. Albania's Parliament has ratified a controversial
*02:13.700- 02:18.620* :  asylum deal with Italy, which will see two reception centres set up on Albanian territory
*02:18.620- 02:24.260* :  for migrants rescued at sea by Italian authorities. In return, Albania will receive up to 650
*02:24.300- 02:30.000* :  million dollars over a period of five years for the construction and operation of the hubs.
*02:30.580- 02:36.080* :  In a noisy session peppered with horns and whistles, the deal passed with the backing of 77 MPs
*02:36.420- 02:40.760* :  out of the 140 seat Parliament with the opposition boycotting the votes.
*02:44.140- 02:48.620* :  Minister of the Republic of Italy, the Minister of the Republic of the Republic of Italy,
*02:51.660- 02:57.000* :  earlier I spoke to the BBC's Balkans correspondent Guy Delorny, who has been following the votes
*02:57.000- 03:01.500* :  in Toronto. It's actually funnily enough, it's more like business as usual in Albania's Parliament
*03:01.500- 03:06.280* :  over the past couple of months. There's been a lot of protests by opposition MPs and not just
*03:06.280- 03:12.880* :  about this issue, but they have been fairly steadfast in their opposition to this deal between
*03:12.880- 03:18.700* :  Albania and Italy about these asylum processing centres. The Opposition argument was that the
*03:18.700- 03:25.240* :  deal violated Albania's sovereignty, therefore also Albania's constitution. That went all the way
*03:25.240- 03:31.860* :  up to the constitutional court, which narrowly ruled that their case didn't have validity,
*03:31.860- 03:37.120* :  in other words, that it was constitutional and that the vote could go ahead. But the opposition
*03:37.120- 03:41.660* :  certainly weren't happy about it. There had been protests on the streets this week in Albania
*03:41.660- 03:45.620* :  by the opposition, and this will give more fuel to those. It's interesting also to get the
*03:45.620- 03:50.720* :  reaction from Prime Minister Eddie Rama. The way he's playing this, he's saying this is showing
*03:50.720- 03:57.920* :  Albania standing together with Italy by choosing to act as an EU member state and agreeing to share
*03:57.920- 04:05.240* :  a burden that Europe must bear united as one family in the face of a bold challenge. So Albania,
*04:05.240- 04:10.600* :  as people may or may not know, has received the green light to start EU accession talks. Mr Rama,
*04:10.600- 04:14.800* :  the Prime Minister, they're saying, right, this is us acting as a member of the European Union.
*04:15.240- 04:20.860* :  Guided on it there, and with reaction from Albania, what they're about Italy, I spoke to the BBC's
*04:20.860- 04:26.220* :  Rome-produced David A. Gileoni. I asked him how the news is likely to go down in Italy, and with
*04:26.220- 04:31.040* :  George Imeloni, who has campaigned against immigration. Opposition former Lorny Diz is this
*04:31.040- 04:36.780* :  a major victory, I would say, although from a symbolic point of view mainly, but obviously that's
*04:36.780- 04:42.700* :  what she promised before she was elected. She really won big on migration. We do know that her party
*04:43.860- 04:49.960* :  has like roots in the far right, and she's been campaigning against the illegal migration. She
*04:49.960- 04:56.860* :  promised that she would send illegal migrants back to North Africa, which is where they come from
*04:56.860- 05:01.060* :  mainly when they arrive in southern Italy. But as soon as she was elected, she clearly struggled
*05:01.060- 05:06.500* :  because numbers keep going up, and it's not that easy. We do know that migration is one of the
*05:06.500- 05:13.180* :  most complicated issues to solve logistically and politically, but this time she managed to strike
*05:13.180- 05:18.140* :  a deal with Albania, and she can show her voters that she's actually doing something for the first time.
*05:18.140- 05:23.680* :  We do know that like many previous governments failed to do so, so she's actually doing something
*05:23.680- 05:29.600* :  concrete. Is anyone going to see a big change? Well, it's hard to say, but I don't think so,
*05:29.600- 05:36.560* :  according to analysts and observers and NGOs, this is not going to make a huge difference because
*05:36.560- 05:43.280* :  the centres that are building are quite small, and also the type of operation they want to set up,
*05:43.320- 05:49.940* :  but it's quite limited as well, because there will be two centres, essentially, one to process
*05:49.940- 05:57.220* :  the migrants and one to accommodate them for a longer period. But the numbers are just so hard,
*05:57.260- 06:03.460* :  that just two centres that are able to accommodate a few hundred people will certainly not be enough.
*06:04.480- 06:11.280* :  Double day Kilioni. Age agencies say hunger and disease are spreading in Gaza as the UK tries
*06:11.280- 06:16.700* :  to drop in aid packages by air for the first time. A correspondent Quentin Somerville was on one of
*06:16.700- 06:20.180* :  the planes and sent this report as some of the first packages were offloaded.
*06:27.340- 06:33.440* :  We're getting close to the dark zone over another Gaza. There's pretty much no other way to get
*06:33.440- 06:38.980* :  help to the remaining population. The Northern Gaza was the most densely populated part of the
*06:39.040- 06:45.760* :  country. Now a way is snapping. Most of the people have forced out the Indian-Israeli
*06:45.920- 06:52.020* :  policy. We'll snob it beyond the pose of how it's seen here today, and there are guests with people.
*06:52.140- 06:57.480* :  The UN said, it's too much violent, it's too much of a growth, it's too long to get
*06:57.480- 07:02.340* :  lead from to that part of the Gaza. But for a bunch of open the doors,
*07:02.660- 07:07.600* :  they're all going to fly out, land as long as Gaza. This is what are the few remaining ways
*07:08.040- 07:13.980* :  to get help for the people as well. I was Quentin Somerville reporting from a plane above
*07:13.980- 07:21.200* :  northern Gaza. The former Brazil footballer, Dani Alves, has been found guilty of raping a woman
*07:21.200- 07:26.460* :  in a Barcelona nightclub in 2022. Alves are three times winner of the European Champions League
*07:26.460- 07:31.560* :  with Barcelona. At a member of Brazil's 2022 World Cup squad was sentenced to four and a half
*07:31.560- 07:37.820* :  years in jail and ordered to pay his victim 150,000 euros. Speaking outside the court, David
*07:37.820- 07:44.540* :  signs a lawyer for the victim welcomed the decision. We are satisfied because the
*07:44.540- 07:50.180* :  sentence recognizes what we have always said, that what the victim was saying she suffered
*07:50.180- 07:55.960* :  had taken place. We have to review now whether the full content of the sentence, the severity
*07:55.960- 08:03.960* :  of the penalty, is in line with the seriousness of the fact. Our correspondent,
*08:03.960- 08:09.980* :  Imidrid Guy Hegeco, has been following the case. In Spain, the definition of sexual assault
*08:09.980- 08:16.240* :  has been broadened due to recent new legislation. So it's much broader than it was. So in the sentence,
*08:16.240- 08:22.880* :  this was described as a sexual assault conviction. But in reality, what it means is it is a rape
*08:22.880- 08:30.320* :  conviction. So he was found guilty of luring this young woman into the toilet of a VIP section in
*08:30.320- 08:36.180* :  a nightclub in Barcelona and raping her there. The woman in this case, the victim, had been calling
*08:36.180- 08:43.180* :  for a 12-year jail term for him and prosecutors have been calling for nine years in jail. Instead,
*08:43.180- 08:48.500* :  he got this four and a half year jail term and he will be supervised for another five years
*08:48.500- 08:54.740* :  after that once he is released from prison. Incredibly well-known name. Any reaction in so far?
*08:54.980- 08:58.660* :  It hasn't really been a reaction from the football world. I mean, we have to remember that our
*08:58.660- 09:04.260* :  this is out of the top tier football world anyway. He hasn't been playing for a top team for a
*09:04.260- 09:09.740* :  few years now. But beyond that, there has been a response. His own lawyer has said that he will
*09:09.780- 09:15.340* :  appeal against this conviction. And so he has the possibility to appeal for the Catalan High Court
*09:16.020- 09:20.520* :  and then possibly the Supreme Court as well. There has been some political response as well.
*09:20.520- 09:25.600* :  The Deputy Prime Minister, Yolanda Diaz, in the left-wing coalition government said that she
*09:25.600- 09:32.780* :  hoped this would serve as an example to discourage future sexist behaviour. So there is some
*09:32.780- 09:36.800* :  response, I think we can expect more response to come over the coming hours. And the issue of
*09:36.800- 09:43.720* :  sexual consent, highly controversial issue, isn't it, in Spain? Yes, it is. That is, in great part,
*09:43.720- 09:49.880* :  because the government, the governments of Pedro Sanchez over recent years, the Socialist Prime
*09:49.880- 09:55.260* :  Minister, have made this something of a priority. So it's become a very much political issue and it's
*09:55.260- 10:00.340* :  been very much in a public domain, the issue of sexual consent. And of course, there was that
*10:00.340- 10:05.340* :  a new piece of legislation introduced a couple of years ago, broadening the definition of sexual
*10:05.340- 10:11.520* :  assault and putting much more on us on a person accused of sexual assault in that they had to prove
*10:11.520- 10:17.420* :  that they had gained consent from someone who was alleging that they were a victim of assault.
*10:17.420- 10:21.500* :  So it's become a very sensitive issue and a very politicised issue as well.
*10:22.400- 10:22.980* :  Guy Hedgeko.
*10:23.940- 10:27.080* :  To Japan now, and the floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
*10:32.100- 10:37.540* :  The floors from traders as the country's main Nikkei 225 stock index reached an all-time high,
*10:37.540- 10:43.580* :  beating the previous record that had stood for more than 30 years. So why now? And what has changed
*10:43.580- 10:49.500* :  a question for our Asia Pacific editor, Celia Hatton? So the Nikkei 225 closed
*10:49.660- 10:57.300* :  up more than 2%. It closed at 39,098. But earlier in the day, as you've said, it
*10:57.340- 11:06.940* :  taught to previous high last set in December 1989, right at the peak of the 1980s bubble for
*11:07.220- 11:13.660* :  Japan, before Japan entered years and years of recession, years that they call the lost decades.
*11:15.120- 11:17.020* :  Why this big rise now then?
*11:18.480- 11:25.240* :  Well, first Japan has a really low currency in comparison, cheap currency in comparison to other
*11:25.660- 11:30.960* :  countries, major economies around the world. The bank of Japan has been actually trying to keep
*11:30.960- 11:37.360* :  interest rates really low. That's in contrast to relatively high interest rates in lots of
*11:37.360- 11:42.520* :  other places in the US, the UK, for example. And so that's a real boon for Japanese
*11:43.060- 11:49.560* :  corporations, companies that ship items elsewhere like Toyota, the world's largest car manufacturer.
*11:50.920- 11:55.460* :  It's able to make things in Japan and ship them elsewhere because of its cheap currency.
*11:55.460- 12:01.640* :  It's keeping the cost of Japanese exports low. So that's why Japanese corporations and global
*12:01.640- 12:06.220* :  corporations listed on the Japanese stock market are doing really, really well right now.
*12:06.520- 12:10.100* :  So Celia, how big a moment is this then for Japan's economy?
*12:11.500- 12:16.000* :  Well, ironically, it's a terrible moment for Japan's economy. Japan's economy is actually just
*12:16.000- 12:23.820* :  entered into a recession. Japan's big corporations are doing really well because of the stock market,
*12:23.820- 12:29.560* :  because of the cheap yen, as I mentioned, because of changes to corporate governance, governance
*12:29.560- 12:36.900* :  that the Japanese government is really supporting at the moment. But the economy as a whole
*12:37.340- 12:42.880* :  is suffering. The cheap yen means that to import things into Japan, it's quite expensive. So
*12:42.880- 12:48.180* :  for average families, anything that they want to buy that has to be brought into Japan. We have
*12:48.180- 12:53.180* :  to remember Japan is just a series of islands. They have to import a lot. It's quite expensive.
*12:53.560- 12:58.400* :  Japan also has an aging population. They've got a lot of labor market issues. It's very
*12:58.400- 13:03.560* :  difficult to fill jobs. And so there's a lot of problems with Japan's wider economy,
*13:03.560- 13:07.840* :  even though the stock market is really doing well and is having a moment.
*13:09.920- 13:14.580* :  In recent decades, ultra-processed food intake has increased dramatically worldwide,
*13:14.580- 13:19.720* :  from fairly obvious things like candy, cakes, and crisps, to seemingly more innocuous
*13:19.720- 13:25.380* :  products like instant noodles or breakfast cereals. These chemically processed foods tend to be
*13:25.380- 13:32.020* :  high in fat, salt and sugar. The UK is one of the largest consumers of these foods in Europe,
*13:32.420- 13:37.780* :  and our new research from the University of Oxford suggests almost 70% of food sales
*13:37.780- 13:43.900* :  from its major manufacturers come from such products. So how serious is this? It's definitely
*13:43.900- 13:49.680* :  apprentice has been investigating. In a world of linguistic gymnastics when it comes to labeling
*13:49.680- 13:56.160* :  foods, particularly from marketing departments, it's easy to lose sight of what an ultra-processed
*13:56.160- 14:02.700* :  food is. Many foods are of course processed in some way, like pasteurizing, but from a scientific
*14:02.700- 14:08.920* :  perspective, something ultra-processed is also chemically processed. It will contain highly
*14:08.920- 14:14.680* :  refined ingredients, artificial substances, chemical flavours, colours, or sweeteners.
*14:15.180- 14:20.400* :  People tend to be aware that the results of this processing taste good, but relatively speaking
*14:20.400- 14:27.500* :  is nutritionally bad. But according to Dr Chris Van Torken, the author of ultra-processed people,
*14:28.000- 14:32.760* :  eating these foods should in his view be regarded as a lifestyle choice, like smoking.
*14:33.620- 14:37.680* :  Globally they are the leading cause of early deaths that they've overtaken tobacco.
*14:38.060- 14:42.040* :  So the ancestry of these ultra-processed, or high fat, salt sugar foods, is in tobacco. The
*14:42.040- 14:45.220* :  biggest tobacco companies in the world and the 1980s owned the biggest food companies,
*14:45.620- 14:49.380* :  they used their marketing techniques, they used their flavour molecules to create the range
*14:49.380- 14:53.920* :  of products that make up most of our diet today. They are addictive, they're incredibly harmful
*14:53.920- 14:57.880* :  in a lot of different ways, but they definitely drive weight gain and malnutrition,
*14:58.280- 15:02.060* :  and we need to use a tobacco control approach, and that's what I'm going to be saying in the
*15:02.060- 15:07.760* :  Lords today. He's referring to the House of Lords in the UK where the issue is being raised by
*15:07.760- 15:14.000* :  a campaign group. It suggests the solution starts before a customer even enters a supermarket
*15:14.000- 15:20.820* :  by controlling food advertising and particularly for young people. Seventeen-year-old Luke Hall
*15:20.820- 15:25.700* :  is one of them. I'll get up and maybe scrolling my phone and I might see an ad for a burger,
*15:25.700- 15:29.480* :  and then I'll go and walk to the bus stop, and then there'll be an ice cream staring me back in
*15:29.480- 15:33.380* :  the face, and then I'll turn my bus ticket over, and there'll yet be another junk food ad,
*15:33.760- 15:36.280* :  and I haven't even got to school yet, and I've already been bombarded.
*15:37.020- 15:41.520* :  While burgers and ice creams are classic examples of unhealthy food,
*15:41.760- 15:46.900* :  those who defend ultra-process food point out that some so-called health food like tofu
*15:47.440- 15:52.280* :  also has to be highly processed, and that more nuanced labeling is what's needed
*15:52.700- 15:56.440* :  clarifying nutritional value. Dr. Chris agrees.
*15:57.200- 16:01.980* :  We should stick big, black, octagon warning labels, according to the levels that we have
*16:01.980- 16:05.920* :  agreed on as a nation on our food to warn people about those things, because at the moment,
*16:05.920- 16:10.800* :  if you buy a can of cola, it has three green traffic lights on it, and one red for sugar.
*16:11.080- 16:16.280* :  How can a can of cola have three green signals to proceed my six-year-old can buy it in any shop?
*16:16.820- 16:20.300* :  Dr. Chris van Tulligan ending that report by Stephanie Prentice.
*16:23.400- 16:24.920* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*16:26.060- 16:28.740* :  The mystery of the obscene little hampton letter.
*16:28.860- 16:29.920* :  You folks see it old.
*16:31.000- 16:33.240* :  And the swearing is taken from the real letters.
*16:34.620- 16:35.740* :  You really are a trickster.
*16:37.800- 16:42.700* :  The 100-year-old mystery of who was menacing an English village with
*16:43.900- 16:45.500* :  extremely poisonous letters.

*17:31.040- 17:34.860* :  Foreign ministers from eight countries have confronted their Russian counterpart
*17:34.940- 17:41.640* :  at a meeting of G20 countries in Brazil over the death of Alexei Navalny and the war in Ukraine.
*17:41.640- 17:47.120* :  Lord Cameron, Britain's representative told the BBC that Sergei Lavrov looked away or at his
*17:47.120- 17:52.800* :  phone when Russia was being criticised. Mr. Lavrov used his speech to the G20 to call
*17:52.800- 17:59.100* :  allegations that Russia's leading dissident was murdered a fabrication. But crucial now in Moscow
*17:59.100- 18:04.580* :  is also how the war in Ukraine is perceived two years after the full-scale invasion.
*18:05.140- 18:08.500* :  These are the reflections of our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg.
*18:09.640- 18:13.500* :  Well, I'm standing by the Solovetsky Stone, which is a Moscow monument
*18:13.500- 18:19.400* :  to the victims of political repression. The old KGB building is just across the road.
*18:20.040- 18:23.360* :  It's now headquarters of the FSB Security Service.
*18:24.540- 18:28.220* :  Five days after the news of Alexei Navalny's death in prison,
*18:28.800- 18:33.700* :  Muscovites are still coming here. Despite the heavy police presence,
*18:34.560- 18:41.720* :  there are lots of officers around here standing, watching what is happening. People are coming,
*18:41.720- 18:45.740* :  they're laying flowers, they're lighting candles, and they're standing in silence,
*18:45.820- 18:51.360* :  clearly shocked at what has happened. Let's hear first from Sophia.
*18:51.760- 18:57.720* :  So I came yesterday and today you feel a bit better after that.
*18:58.240- 19:02.400* :  What was your reaction on Friday when you heard the news about Mr.
*19:02.400- 19:07.380* :  the Wendt's death? It was devastating. Really devastating.
*19:12.620- 19:16.940* :  On her phone here, Anastasia is listening to a song called Hope.
*19:17.760- 19:24.120* :  Alexei Navalny had quoted lines from it in his final social media post to his wife, Yulia.
*19:30.020- 19:36.280* :  Anastasia tells me that police have been detaining some people who've come out to commemorate Mr. Navalny.
*19:37.180- 19:43.760* :  Putin feared Navalny when he was alive, she says. He fears him, even now Navalny's dead.
*19:51.900- 19:55.040* :  Well, I've walked about 10 minutes down the road towards the Kremlin,
*19:55.240- 20:01.260* :  and to be honest, it feels very strange because in stark contrast to what I just see,
*20:02.680- 20:09.060* :  it is an image of normality, and yet just chatting to people around here, no one I've spoken to,
*20:09.600- 20:12.100* :  thinks the situation in Russia is normal.
*20:15.580- 20:21.040* :  Alexander tells me that in two years, the economy has got worse, and so has the general mood.
*20:23.340- 20:29.340* :  Everyone's worse off in the moral sense. Yulia never says it's terrible that people are being killed,
*20:29.660- 20:40.140* :  so we try not to think about it. Well, I've left Moscow now, I've driven 40 miles to the
*20:40.140- 20:45.760* :  town of Solnitsch Nagorsk, dear what people are thinking away from the capital. I'm in the local
*20:45.760- 20:52.160* :  park, and what's interesting here is that the last two years of Russian history are all around me.
*20:52.500- 20:57.940* :  There's some graffiti in support of the Wagner mercenaries. There are some flowers I can see
*20:57.940- 21:06.100* :  in memory of Alexey Navalny, and a giant mural of two local men who were killed fighting in Ukraine.
*21:09.720- 21:15.100* :  Marina tells me that she's proud of Russian men who she says have been doing their duty on the
*21:15.100- 21:22.360* :  front line. Then she looks across at her 17-year-old son, Andrey, but as a mother she adds,
*21:22.360- 21:29.260* :  I'm scared that my son will be sent off to fight. That's why I want peace as soon as possible,
*21:29.260- 21:35.700* :  so that we won't have to fear what tomorrow may bring. Everyone I spoke to in Solnitsch
*21:35.700- 21:41.860* :  Nagorsk and in Moscow said they wanted peace, but nobody believed that there was anything they
*21:41.860- 21:47.460* :  could do as individuals, as citizens of Russia, to make that happen.
*21:48.640- 21:53.380* :  I'm hearing that from Steve Rosenberg. It's hard to remember. There was a time when Russia and
*21:53.380- 21:59.040* :  the West spoke of cooperation and partnership. Over 20 years ago, the former Secretary-General of
*21:59.040- 22:04.940* :  NATO, George Robertson, visited Moscow and held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin,
*22:05.500- 22:11.240* :  and all Robertson made these positive noises back then. I am confident that this new level of
*22:11.240- 22:17.320* :  cooperation between NATO's members and Russia will now change the world and for the better.
*22:18.360- 22:25.160* :  So what then has fundamentally changed? On a recent visit to London, Steve Rosenberg sat
*22:25.160- 22:29.500* :  down with the former NATO chief to talk about Russia today and Vladimir Putin.
*22:30.040- 22:35.880* :  The Putin I met with did good business with, established a NATO Russia council with,
*22:36.600- 22:42.560* :  is very, very different from this almost megalomaniac at the present moment.
*22:43.500- 22:49.840* :  I think that Vladimir Putin has a very thin skin and a huge ambition for his country,
*22:50.560- 22:58.840* :  an unrealistic ambition to be the equivalent of the USSR. The Soviet Union was recognized as
*22:58.840- 23:05.600* :  the second superpower in the world. Russia can't make any claims in that direction. And I think
*23:05.600- 23:14.120* :  that that sort of ate away at his ego. And you combine that with the fee bonus sometimes of the
*23:14.120- 23:21.720* :  West on display. I think that changed the individual who wanted to cooperate with NATO into somebody who
*23:21.720- 23:27.920* :  now sees NATO as a huge threat. Did you ever get the impression that Putin wanted to join NATO?
*23:27.920- 23:33.260* :  Did he ever talk to you about that? At my second meeting with Putin he explicitly said,
*23:33.260- 23:39.700* :  when are you going to invite Russia to join NATO? And I said, well, we don't invite countries to
*23:39.700- 23:44.460* :  join NATO. They apply. I think he wanted it presented to him.
*23:45.060- 23:51.620* :  Vladimir Putin often expresses bitterness and resentment when he talks about what happened after 1991,
*23:51.620- 23:57.640* :  the fall of the Soviet Union. And he claims that the West broke a promise. He claims that the West
*23:57.640- 24:03.260* :  promised not to enlarge NATO and inch to the East. Was there a promise?
*24:03.680- 24:07.700* :  There was certainly nothing on paper. There was nothing that was agreed. There was no treaty
*24:08.700- 24:16.180* :  to that effect. And again, it looks as though Putin is building a case on the basis of an assertion
*24:16.640- 24:23.440* :  and then using everything to back it off. What do we do now? I mean, we're two years into this war
*24:23.880- 24:30.840* :  and so far away from the days that you were describing there when Russia was almost brought in
*24:31.360- 24:37.080* :  to this family of nations. There's only one thing that the Russian elite recognized and that
*24:37.080- 24:44.740* :  is strength. And maybe with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the failure to adhere to the red
*24:44.740- 24:50.300* :  lines in Syria gave exactly the wrong signal to Putin about the resolution of the West.
*24:51.040- 24:55.560* :  He's now got it really badly wrong. He wanted to stop the enlargement of NATO
*24:55.580- 25:02.400* :  two new countries, our joining. If Russia was to win and subordinate and destroy,
*25:02.400- 25:09.900* :  Ukraine is an independent sovereign nation state, then Vladimir Putin and the authoritarians of
*25:09.900- 25:16.040* :  the world won't stop there. And there is no doubt at all that they are watching animatedly at
*25:16.040- 25:20.520* :  the present moment. And we need to give them the right signals at the right time.
*25:21.740- 25:28.820* :  George Robertson. Next to what the UN has called one of the most complex humanitarian crises in
*25:28.820- 25:34.180* :  the world. Almost six million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been displaced by
*25:34.180- 25:39.340* :  ongoing fighting between the army and the rebel group known as the M23. In recent weeks, the
*25:39.340- 25:45.040* :  clashes have moved close to one of the DRC's biggest cities, Goma, fueling government suspicion
*25:45.040- 25:49.660* :  that the rebels could try to take it. The BBC's Marco Oriente reports.
*25:54.040- 25:59.480* :  It's early morning at the internally displaced people camp at Luciangala in the Eastern Democratic
*25:59.480- 26:05.580* :  Republic of Congo, a dump fog lingers in the air as women and girls patiently wait in line
*26:05.580- 26:13.180* :  to refill plastic jerry cans with water. Life has become very difficult. We lack sufficient
*26:13.180- 26:21.240* :  food and proper shelter. 30-year-old Sifamhongo fled Sake, a town less than an hour drive away from here.
*26:21.600- 26:29.740* :  Her life has been upturned by tragedy. Life back home was good. I used to go to the farm to work
*26:29.800- 26:35.740* :  my land and gather vegetables for me and my children. One day while I was gathering firewood in
*26:35.740- 26:44.280* :  the forest, I was sexually assaulted by armed men. More than two and a half million people have
*26:44.280- 26:49.900* :  been displaced in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo since October. Violence has erupted across
*26:49.900- 26:56.360* :  their towns as the army tries to crush the expansion of the armed rebel group known as the M23.
*27:00.960- 27:06.320* :  The road connecting the mountain village of Masisi to Luciangala is busy with motorbikes loaded
*27:06.320- 27:12.320* :  with rolled up mattresses. Next to them walks a steady stream of people carrying the few essential
*27:12.320- 27:19.340* :  items they were able to collect before fleeing home. I have found some relief in sleeping at the
*27:19.340- 27:25.780* :  camp because I no longer hear the constant gunfire. Timothinger Ambe, a father of three, made this
*27:25.780- 27:31.700* :  journey when violence broke out in his own village. I cannot even begin to compare the quality of
*27:31.700- 27:37.000* :  life I once had to the current conditions in this camp. The suffering we endure here is
*27:37.000- 27:42.200* :  incredibly difficult to bear. The only solution for finding peace and returning home is for the
*27:42.200- 27:51.580* :  government to expel the rebels from the country. The DRC government and the M23 are fighting over
*27:51.580- 27:58.460* :  the management of precious mineral resources and political influence. But as the strife continues,
*27:58.960- 28:04.200* :  aid agencies fear a worsening of the health conditions of the people escaping violence.
*28:06.500- 28:12.060* :  The M23 rebels say they want to be integrated into the Congolese National Army and become a
*28:12.060- 28:18.360* :  recognized political party. But DRC's communication minister Patrick Muayaya says the country is not
*28:18.360- 28:23.260* :  open to talks with the M23 and accuses neighboring Rwanda of supporting them.
*28:33.380- 28:42.860* :  Rwanda has consistently denied backing the M23 rebels in DRC. Meanwhile, as the dialogue between
*28:42.860- 28:50.320* :  the two sides stalls, ordinary civilians continue to suffer. Marco Orianto reporting.
*28:51.500- 28:58.120* :  X, formerly known as Twitter, has admitted taking down accounts and posts related to the
*28:58.120- 29:03.040* :  farmers protests in India on government orders. A platform has launched a legal challenge
*29:03.040- 29:08.820* :  the BBC's Yogi Te Limayay reports. A few days ago, a number of accounts of journalists and
*29:08.820- 29:14.440* :  activists posting about the farmers protests were withheld by X, formerly known as Twitter.
*29:15.120- 29:19.500* :  The micro-blogging site has now clarified in a statement that this was done to comply with
*29:19.500- 29:25.120* :  executive orders issued by the Indian government, failing which X could be subject to penalties,
*29:25.120- 29:30.840* :  including significant fines and imprisonment. The company said a disagrees with the actions and
*29:30.840- 29:34.540* :  maintains that freedom of expression should extend to the posts withheld.
*29:50.240- 29:50.260* :  The
*29:50.260- 29:55.060* :  Beyoncé's decision to pivot to country music has paid off. She's become the first
*29:55.060- 29:59.180* :  black woman ever to have a number one on the US billboard country music chart,
*29:59.820- 30:05.840* :  when one country radio station refused to play her song Texas Holdham. It sparked an outcry
*30:05.980- 30:11.980* :  from fans. But the Rao Show just how hard it is for black singers to break into this genre of
*30:11.980- 30:19.980* :  American music. In 2022, black artists received less than 1% of airplay on country music radio.
*30:19.980- 30:27.040* :  Julie Williams is an African-American country singer-songwriter based in Nashville. She told Rajini
*30:27.040- 30:32.580* :  Vidinathan that country music owes a great debt to black people and that Beyoncé has gone back to
*30:32.580- 30:38.280* :  her roots. She grew up in Houston. She grew up in Texas. Black people have been in country music
*30:38.280- 30:43.120* :  for years, although that's not maybe what you think of when you think of American country music.
*30:43.120- 30:48.740* :  So it's a very exciting time not only for black fans and folks who are getting to discover country
*30:48.740- 30:53.220* :  for the first time, but also for a lot of black and mixed country artists like myself who have been
*30:53.220- 30:59.100* :  out here trying to make a name for ourselves in this town and to get some recognition and to see
*30:59.100- 31:05.240* :  someone as amazing as Beyoncé have this number one success, historic success. It's inspiring for us.
*31:05.540- 31:11.020* :  We're making a lot of the fact that she is the first black woman to top these charts, but you're
*31:11.020- 31:17.260* :  saying that country music has always been part of black culture as much as white culture in the US.
*31:17.600- 31:22.240* :  Yeah, black folks actually made country music in the United States. The banjo, which a lot of us
*31:22.240- 31:26.360* :  think of when we think of country music, was created by slaves. Country music, as we think of it now,
*31:26.360- 31:31.220* :  actually came from minstrel shows in which white folks were making fun of black music.
*31:31.220- 31:36.580* :  And then it ultimately got incorporated and changed. And as was seen as this creation of white
*31:36.580- 31:42.880* :  people, but it really was it came out of black music at that time. And as country has gone along,
*31:42.880- 31:48.380* :  it has turned into this genre that you think of as very white male dominated with women out of
*31:48.380- 31:52.740* :  the picture, black artists out of the picture, queer artists out of the picture. But a lot of us
*31:52.740- 31:58.580* :  are here trying to tell our stories and find audiences. So Beyoncé is already doing with
*31:58.820- 32:02.780* :  in Texas Holdham, ran in Giddens, banjo is right at the beginning is my hope is that it will
*32:02.780- 32:08.300* :  educate people to know that black people have a place in country music already. I've even found
*32:08.300- 32:13.220* :  on my own social media just by Beyoncé posting her music and then us saying, Hey, if you love
*32:13.220- 32:17.760* :  listening to Beyoncé, check out these other artists. We've seen some smaller independent black
*32:17.760- 32:22.240* :  artists go viral because they're going directly from fan to artist rather than through these
*32:22.240- 32:25.920* :  date keepers that have historically kept black folks out of that conversation.
*32:32.960- 32:39.000* :  Julie Williams and her song Southern Curls. Well, let's end this edition on something less
*32:39.000- 32:45.720* :  harmonious. Showdown between two neighbours that sent a British seaside town into a frenzy
*32:45.820- 32:51.740* :  100 years ago that has now been turned into a comedy starring Olivia Coleman and Jesse Buckley.
*32:52.400- 32:58.320* :  In 1920, police in Little Hampton, a town on the south coast were on the hunt for the person
*32:58.320- 33:05.520* :  behind some ill-tempered letters to say the very least that were sent to respected members
*33:05.520- 33:12.140* :  of the community. But who was sending them? Our culture reporter Yasmin Rufo has been talking to
*33:12.140- 33:18.140* :  the stars of the film. The mystery of the obscene Little Hampton letter. Parliament absolutely
*33:18.140- 33:23.660* :  did debate it and it was covered by all the broadsheets at the time. The Helm Secretary,
*33:23.660- 33:29.040* :  Mr. Edward Short, was compelled to answer a question in Parliament about the ever-growing
*33:29.040- 33:35.080* :  scandal. And the nation was gripped by this. Dear Edith, you folks see it's old.
*33:35.680- 33:41.840* :  And the swearing is taken from the real letters. Carry on. You really are a tricks your
*33:42.660- 33:48.700* :  It's 1920 and in a sleepy seaside town in the south of England, Edith Swan, played by Olivia
*33:48.700- 33:54.960* :  Coleman, accuses her neighbour Rose Gooding, played by Jesse Buckley, of writing poison pen letters.
*33:55.240- 34:00.820* :  I couldn't believe that it was a real story but I was really glad it was. Yeah, you daftles!
*34:01.960- 34:08.900* :  I swear and if people speak to us Titan because I swear I just think I'm not killing anyone,
*34:08.900- 34:13.600* :  not hurting anyone. You know some people like I think walked out of the cinema and you think
*34:13.600- 34:20.600* :  ah get out of yourself. They really need to have a good swearing. I forgive you Rose. Edith,
*34:21.760- 34:26.420* :  I didn't do it. While the police were certain that Rose was behind the swearing letters,
*34:26.940- 34:31.820* :  one female police officer had her doubts. Rose is about to go down for something she didn't do.
*34:32.820- 34:37.840* :  I'm not standing for it. I should think not. The woman who is the most fundamental
*34:37.840- 34:44.140* :  to cracking the case is Gladys Moss. Historian Emily Cocaine researched the little hampton
*34:44.140- 34:50.640* :  libles for her recent book Penning Poison. She clearly has a different sense about what is happening.
*34:51.140- 34:55.740* :  Does Gladys Moss ever get the recognition for what she didn't in cracking the case?
*34:55.940- 35:04.000* :  Of course she didn't know. Gladys Moss had the year before had to fight for her job and an
*35:04.000- 35:10.600* :  intervention of local influential women had helped her to keep her job. It's like a trap door
*35:10.600- 35:16.260* :  to hell opens up every way you tread. I'm not actually evil you know. I've got evil in you.
*35:16.360- 35:20.800* :  No one could have imagined the impact these anonymous letters would have had on the country.
*35:20.980- 35:28.260* :  I guess in modern day you kind of expect some sort of sensationalist trolling unfortunately,
*35:28.260- 35:33.380* :  but for it to happen in the 1920s and through letters and to have sent up not just a little
*35:33.380- 35:40.040* :  village in England into frenzy, but a whole country. It was shocking. Yeah yeah. I love the
*35:40.480- 35:44.600* :  level of shock and I feel sad that the shock doesn't happen anymore. It's this commonplace.
*35:44.600- 35:49.160* :  Everybody's cruel to everybody else online and that's awful and I would love to go back to the days
*35:49.160- 35:54.160* :  of it's not okay. How do you think society has sort of changed? Why has that become acceptable now?
*35:54.160- 35:58.600* :  But a hundred years ago was so awful. I suppose it's so hard to police isn't it? It's
*35:59.420- 36:04.640* :  the anonymity of it. I mean it doesn't take away the fact that it's a horrible thing,
*36:04.640- 36:10.660* :  it's a despicable thing to do to someone. A culture reporter Yasmin Rufo.
