*01:25.060- 01:28.760* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Tuesday the 27th of February,
*01:28.780- 01:30.080* :  these are our main stories.
*01:30.740- 01:34.280* :  The last barrier to Sweden becoming a member of NATO has been lifted
*01:34.580- 01:36.780* :  with hungry, finely giving its approval.
*01:37.640- 01:40.940* :  The US Supreme Court is hearing arguments about social media companies
*01:40.940- 01:43.480* :  that could transform the way we use the internet.
*01:44.420- 01:46.440* :  10 days after his unexpected death,
*01:46.440- 01:50.000* :  an ally of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny
*01:50.460- 01:53.240* :  says he was about to be freed in a prisoner exchange.
*01:56.300- 01:58.780* :  Also in this podcast and here's this letter
*02:00.120- 02:03.980* :  with the tiniest writing imaginable and it starts off
*02:04.280- 02:08.640* :  the woman at the centre of a love triangle between the Beatles star George Harrison
*02:08.720- 02:12.240* :  and guitarist Eric Clapton is selling their letters to her.
*02:17.160- 02:20.980* :  The final obstacle to Sweden's bid to join NATO has been cleared
*02:21.220- 02:24.440* :  after Hungary's parliament voted to accept its membership.
*02:25.180- 02:28.660* :  Sweden will now become the organisation's 30 second member
*02:29.160- 02:34.520* :  after its neighbour Finland joined last year in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*02:35.420- 02:39.460* :  The Swedish Prime Minister of Christian called it a historic day
*02:39.680- 02:43.560* :  and said his country stood ready to shoulder its security responsibilities.
*02:44.520- 02:47.960* :  The NATO Secretary General Jens Daltonberg said Sweden's accession
*02:47.960- 02:51.500* :  would help the alliance face the growing threat from Russia.
*02:52.100- 02:57.580* :  It makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer and all of us more secure.
*02:57.840- 03:00.900* :  It also demonstrates that NATO's door is open.
*03:01.520- 03:05.920* :  That President Putin did not succeed in his attempt to close NATO's door.
*03:06.720- 03:10.980* :  As our correspondent Caroline Hori reports, it's been a bumpy road for Sweden
*03:11.420- 03:16.880* :  which had to overcome opposition from not just one but two NATO members to join the alliance.
*03:22.700- 03:25.360* :  A vote in Hungary's parliament this afternoon,
*03:25.760- 03:28.720* :  a moment Sweden has been waiting for for nearly two years.
*03:29.600- 03:33.940* :  Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine prompted the Nordic country to abandon two centuries
*03:33.940- 03:35.380* :  of military non-alignment.
*03:36.320- 03:39.880* :  But two countries stood in Sweden's way, Turkey and Hungary,
*03:40.400- 03:43.180* :  both closer to Russia than other members of the U.S.-led alliance.
*03:44.440- 03:47.480* :  Turkey's anger about Kurdish militants given refuge in Sweden
*03:47.940- 03:51.200* :  was as waged when tougher anti-terrorism laws were passed in Stockholm.
*03:52.240- 03:56.580* :  But that still left Hungary, its nationalist government upset by Swedish criticism
*03:56.580- 03:58.160* :  of its democratic standards.
*03:58.480- 04:01.300* :  Today the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán addressed parliament.
*04:01.300- 04:02.680* :  Pistach Vorsak-Jules,
*04:03.300- 04:04.600* :  Hungary Vorsak Kormányov,
*04:04.600- 04:06.580* :  Kípiselyk, Eliteljestete,
*04:06.800- 04:09.060* :  Sweden Vorsak, Nátočatlak-Ozászát.
*04:09.220- 04:11.940* :  He asked it to vote in favour of Sweden joining NATO.
*04:11.940- 04:16.600* :  It duly did, three days after the Swedish Prime Minister visited Budapest
*04:16.900- 04:20.000* :  and a deal was done for Hungary to buy four warplanes from Sweden.
*04:21.080- 04:25.580* :  Robert Dalscher of the Swedish Defence Research Agency said his country would bring NATO
*04:25.580- 04:29.640* :  its modern air force and submarines specially adapted to the Baltic Sea.
*04:30.260- 04:33.880* :  And it would gain security, supported by U.S. nuclear deterrence.
*04:34.180- 04:37.460* :  We did not have the web withle to stand up to Russia
*04:37.860- 04:42.620* :  if there would be a real fight or if they would choose to pressure us really hard.
*04:42.900- 04:46.520* :  And the war in Ukraine has shown that only treaty allies
*04:47.120- 04:49.040* :  are recovered by the security guarantee.
*04:49.680- 04:52.140* :  And thus we needed to come in under the umbrella.
*04:52.400- 04:55.680* :  NATO will now have control over almost the entire Baltic Sea.
*04:56.140- 04:59.740* :  It will also have 32 members, another expansion of the alliance
*04:59.740- 05:03.320* :  which Vladimir Putin had set his invasion of Ukraine aimed to stop.
*05:04.140- 05:08.600* :  Caroline Hawley, social media has dramatically changed our lives.
*05:08.880- 05:11.940* :  Now the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in two cases
*05:11.940- 05:14.680* :  that could dramatically reshape online platforms.
*05:15.440- 05:19.440* :  The judges are considering whether the Republican controlled states of Texas and Florida
*05:19.880- 05:24.560* :  should have the power to decide what posts social media platforms can remove from their services.
*05:25.260- 05:27.580* :  A U.S. business correspondent, Michelle Flurry,
*05:28.180- 05:32.220* :  explained how these cases had ended up coming before the Supreme Court.
*05:32.980- 05:39.260* :  You have to go back to the siege on the capital on Jan 6, 2021 after that.
*05:40.120- 05:44.020* :  President Donald Trump at the time was barred from Facebook to Twitter and YouTube.
*05:44.740- 05:50.180* :  And in response to that, Florida enacted a law that made it illegal for technology companies to ban
*05:51.520- 05:53.880* :  from their sites of candidate for office in the state.
*05:53.880- 05:56.520* :  In other words, if there was any political candidate on the site,
*05:56.540- 05:58.560* :  their content couldn't be blocked.
*05:59.840- 06:02.340* :  And the same in Texas, they passed a law
*06:03.060- 06:05.880* :  which banned the platforms from taking down political content.
*06:06.760- 06:11.280* :  In part, this was in reaction to what many Republicans have alleged
*06:11.280- 06:15.260* :  has been sort of a censorship by Silicon Valley on more conservative views.
*06:15.760- 06:19.500* :  And now what's happened is as this has worked its way through challenges in the court,
*06:19.500- 06:23.420* :  it's ended up before the nation's highest court, who must now decide
*06:24.420- 06:28.360* :  what people in America can hear, say, and read online.
*06:29.600- 06:31.620* :  And when are we expecting a decision?
*06:31.620- 06:33.540* :  And what could its impact be?
*06:34.560- 06:38.120* :  We expect the court will take a couple of months.
*06:38.120- 06:41.100* :  So people are saying June might be when we get it.
*06:41.100- 06:46.440* :  And that is a crucial time if you think of the election cycle and the upcoming presidential election.
*06:46.840- 06:50.200* :  The decision could be pretty explosive because it is a test of
*06:50.500- 06:55.660* :  the first amendment in the digital era and kind of how it applies to the internet.
*06:55.660- 06:59.640* :  You have attorneys for these states defending the laws,
*07:00.140- 07:03.620* :  saying that they simply want to be able to regulate businesses, not their speech.
*07:03.620- 07:07.680* :  But then you've got those who are challenging the law,
*07:08.180- 07:11.500* :  including a tech industry group called NetChoice, who say,
*07:11.500- 07:15.640* :  look, you're violating or infringing the first amendment rights of these businesses,
*07:15.640- 07:20.280* :  which is to publish content as they see fit.
*07:20.280- 07:23.560* :  And without being told what they can't or can't do by the government.
*07:23.920- 07:30.180* :  And assuming that the US Supreme Court rules in favor of these Republican controlled states,
*07:30.860- 07:33.880* :  could this have an impact outside the United States?
*07:35.980- 07:40.980* :  Well, I mean, I think if you imagine that the ruling goes against these tech giants,
*07:41.780- 07:45.020* :  there is concern, or at least the argument that they've been making in front of the
*07:45.020- 07:48.800* :  justices today is that it would have ramifications for their business models,
*07:48.800- 07:53.680* :  that the curation is crucial to attracting users and advertise.
*07:53.860- 07:57.880* :  And they gave examples of sites like Etsy, which is popular with crafters, saying,
*07:58.420- 08:02.300* :  if you don't filter what sites are presented to users,
*08:02.300- 08:06.520* :  it can become unmanageable, unwielding, it would make their businesses less successful.
*08:07.060- 08:11.440* :  And so I think that's where you can see a ripple effect, more broadly, not just in the US,
*08:11.440- 08:18.660* :  but internationally. On the flip side of this, if the ruling goes against the states who made
*08:18.660- 08:24.320* :  these laws, there is an argument of then, well, how hard is it to rein in and to regulate
*08:25.140- 08:28.560* :  these tech companies? And that's certainly the argument, the attorneys are making,
*08:28.560- 08:33.660* :  it'll be interesting to see what EU regulators, which in many ways have been doing a better job
*08:33.660- 08:37.500* :  of regulating these tech giants than we've seen the US regulators do.
*08:38.680- 08:43.720* :  Michelle Flurry, was Alexa in Navalny about to be freed as part of a Russian
*08:43.720- 08:48.680* :  prisoner swap when he unexpectedly died in the penal colony where he was being held?
*08:49.400- 08:54.760* :  As the claim being made by a close colleague of Mr Navalny's, Maria Pevcik says the opposition
*08:54.760- 08:59.880* :  leader was going to be exchanged for a Russian hitman who's currently serving a life sentence for
*08:59.880- 09:05.940* :  murder in Germany. In a video posted on YouTube, she said that in the end, the Russian President,
*09:05.940- 09:11.840* :  Vladimir Putin, could not bear the thought of his most high profile opponent being freed.
*09:13.480- 09:19.640* :  Navalny was everything Putin won't ever become and Putin hated him for that. Why did he kill
*09:19.640- 09:25.300* :  Navalny right now? Why the 16th of February? Navalny should have been freed in the following days
*09:25.840- 09:31.400* :  because in early February, Putin proposed a swap between an FSB officer and a hitman,
*09:31.900- 09:37.460* :  who was in prison in Berlin, for two US nationals and Alexei Navalny.
*09:38.400- 09:44.100* :  The Russia editor of BBC Monitoring Vitaly Shevchenko told us more about the claim being made
*09:44.100- 09:52.760* :  by Mr Navalny's ally. Maria Pevcik is a key associate of Alexei Navalny or was and she said
*09:52.760- 10:00.380* :  that the night before Mr Navalny died, she had been told that negotiations
*10:01.360- 10:07.440* :  about his swap had reached the final stage. That's the wording that Mr Pevcik used.
*10:08.160- 10:15.840* :  According to her, Alexei Navalny and two unnamed US nationals were to be exchanged for
*10:15.840- 10:22.600* :  somebody called Vadim Karasikov, who is Russian secret service assassin, currently serving a
*10:22.600- 10:30.380* :  life sentence in Germany. And then, according to Mr Pevcik, President Putin did something irrational.
*10:30.380- 10:38.240* :  He had Alexei Navalny killed in jail. That's the ligation coming from his team and his relatives.
*10:38.820- 10:44.260* :  And how credible is this allegation? Was anyone else talking about a possible prisoner exchange?
*10:45.300- 10:51.680* :  Well, interestingly, President Putin himself, when he spoke in an interview with Tucker Carlson,
*10:51.680- 10:59.540* :  the US media personality, earlier this month, he hinted at the possibility of exchanging
*10:59.540- 11:05.180* :  Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, currently in detention in Russia,
*11:06.040- 11:13.440* :  exchanging him for Vadim Karasikov, the FSB assassin. So, this remark by the Russian President
*11:14.240- 11:21.360* :  gives some credence to what Mr Pevcik said. Having said that, we still have no idea what exactly
*11:21.360- 11:29.120* :  happened to Alexei Navalny in jail. According to his spokesperson, Kira Yarmish, apparently the
*11:29.120- 11:36.000* :  official investigation in his death concluded that he died of natural causes and few people among
*11:36.000- 11:41.920* :  his supporters are inclined to believe it. But the bottom line is that we don't really know what
*11:41.920- 11:49.020* :  happened to Mr Navalny. And the Kremlin denies that anything underhand happened. Some might ask why
*11:49.020- 11:54.380* :  would President Putin allow a prisoner exchange only to kill Alexei Navalny at the last minute?
*11:54.580- 12:03.300* :  We have to remember that President Putin is a former KGB officer. And as such, it's not unreasonable
*12:03.300- 12:11.500* :  to assume that he would be used to saying one thing and then doing another thing. And if we
*12:11.500- 12:18.880* :  had to believe Maria Pevcik, President Putin hated Alexei Navalny so much that he absolutely
*12:18.880- 12:23.840* :  rejected the very idea of seeing him walk free.
*12:24.800- 12:30.580* :  Vitaly Shevchenko, an Iranian pop singer who encouraged women to break the country's headscarf
*12:30.580- 12:35.440* :  law has had his more than two-year jail sentence commuted to home confinement.
*12:36.280- 12:40.560* :  Madi Yarahi's lawyer said the court took the decision because of his client's health problems.
*12:41.220- 12:46.880* :  Mr Yarahi was arrested in August for releasing a song called Your Headscarf shortly before the
*12:46.880- 12:52.420* :  anniversary of the death and custody of Masa Amini who was detained for not covering her hair two
*12:52.420- 13:04.740* :  years ago. Mike Thompson reports. Take off your scarf. The sun is sinking since Madi Yarahi
*13:05.100- 13:11.200* :  and let your hair flow. Words dedicated, he said, to the courageous Iranian women.
*13:12.000- 13:17.220* :  Not exactly the message the Iranian authorities wanted broadcast either then or now.
*13:17.860- 13:24.380* :  Fearing it by reignite the nationwide protests following Masa Amini's death, Mr Yarahi was
*13:24.380- 13:30.740* :  arrested and later jailed. But with the street protests now largely faded, the rebellious
*13:30.740- 13:37.740* :  song Smith's jail term has been commuted to house arrest at electronic tag and presumably a
*13:37.740- 13:49.640* :  band on singing a certain song. That report by Mike Thompson. Now to a bit of rock history.
*13:50.300- 13:54.780* :  She inspired some of the most memorable songs of the 1960s and 70s.
*13:59.880- 14:01.440* :  Something by George Harrison
*14:09.920- 14:15.920* :  And you look wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton who pursued the model patty boyd while she was
*14:15.940- 14:22.380* :  still married to the Beatles star before eventually marrying her himself. Now the former model
*14:22.380- 14:27.900* :  amuse is selling letters that lift the lid on her infamous love triangle with the two musicians.
*14:27.900- 14:35.020* :  Our music correspondent is Mark Savage. Paddy Boyd was a model first and she really epitomised
*14:35.320- 14:40.540* :  the swinging 60s scene in London. She had this long straight blonde hair and these beautiful
*14:40.540- 14:46.120* :  almond eyes. You would see her down carnaby street and Mary Quant dressed her and talked her
*14:46.500- 14:52.320* :  who then moved into becoming a photographer as well. So very very much part of that 60s
*14:52.320- 14:58.240* :  scene. She met George Harrison on the set of the Beatles Film a Hard Days Night in 1964 and she
*14:58.240- 15:03.860* :  said they instantly felt a connection because they were both quite shy. She was credited with
*15:03.860- 15:08.500* :  kind of expanding his world view. She went to India with them for those famous trips that the
*15:08.500- 15:14.060* :  Beatles took and he wrote dozens of songs about her most famously something in the way she moves
*15:14.060- 15:19.700* :  which he recorded with the Beatles. But at the same time one of George Harrison's best friends
*15:19.700- 15:26.500* :  Eric Clapton had his eye on George Harrison's wife and he was writing her these incredibly
*15:26.500- 15:31.800* :  passionate declarations of love that would be delivered to their mansion in Surrey while George
*15:31.800- 15:38.440* :  Harrison was away on tour or in the recording studio and she had to decide what she was going to do.
*15:39.140- 15:44.240* :  And ultimately she did end up divorcing George Harrison and marrying Eric Clapton later on.
*15:44.820- 15:50.760* :  So given the importance these letters must have to her, why has she decided to auction them now?
*15:50.760- 15:58.520* :  What is she auctioning exactly? Well it's not just the letters that were sent to her by Eric Clapton
*15:58.560- 16:03.840* :  but also love letters that George Harrison wrote but she said that she's kept them all these years
*16:03.840- 16:08.680* :  and she'd looked back at them when she was writing her autobiography a couple of years ago and they
*16:08.680- 16:14.160* :  still calls her a lot of heartache and so I think she's decided that maybe it would be best
*16:14.160- 16:20.360* :  if they were made public so not only is she selling them but you can now read them
*16:20.360- 16:24.340* :  on the Christie's website they're going to be put on display before they're auctioned off
*16:24.780- 16:30.820* :  in London later this month and on the Christie's website actually she's she's posted a video
*16:32.060- 16:36.560* :  describing why she's parting ways with all of this memorabilia but also rather beautifully
*16:36.560- 16:41.240* :  reading that first letter that she got from Eric Clapton. And here's this letter
*16:42.580- 16:48.860* :  that the tiniest writing imaginable and it starts off I'm writing this note to you with the
*16:48.860- 16:53.720* :  main purpose of ascertaining your feelings towards subject well-known to both of us
*16:54.680- 17:00.960* :  or my love E. And Mark even though both Patti Boyd's marriage is ended in divorce the two
*17:00.960- 17:06.900* :  men concerned remained on friendly terms. Yes and even when she married Eric Clapton and I think
*17:06.900- 17:11.360* :  we have to stress there's a gap of almost eight years between her divorcing George Harrison
*17:11.360- 17:17.640* :  and getting together with Eric Clapton and marrying him and they married with George Harrison's
*17:17.640- 17:23.620* :  blessing and in fact at one point in the 1990s the two men appeared on stage together and
*17:23.620- 17:28.140* :  duetted singing something the song that George Harrison had originally written for her
*17:28.500- 17:34.300* :  and George Harrison called Eric Clapton his husband and law. So I guess what is kind of a very
*17:34.300- 17:39.240* :  60s way there was a lot of peace and love about it and they they came to terms with the fact that
*17:39.240- 17:48.400* :  they had both shared a love with this wonderful woman. Mark Savage. Still to come in this podcast

*18:02.820- 18:08.500* :  journalists around the world. Social media has essentially siloed a lot of young men and women

*19:35.200- 19:45.720* :  audiobooks and start listening. Welcome back to the Global News podcast. It's arguably the world's
*19:45.720- 19:51.360* :  worst humanitarian crisis with thousands of people killed and millions more forced to flee.
*19:51.980- 19:57.140* :  But it's also been described as the forgotten war as international attention has focused on
*19:57.140- 20:03.720* :  Gaza and Ukraine. The civil war in Sudan that broke out 10 months ago has unleashed many horrors.
*20:04.060- 20:10.100* :  Widespread rape and torture. Even the beheading of students. Many of those who fled have tried
*20:10.100- 20:16.540* :  to enter Egypt. It has tried to stem the flow by imposing visa restrictions. But as BBC Arabic
*20:16.540- 20:22.380* :  Mohammed Osman reports, that's forced the desperate refugees into the clutches of people's
*20:22.380- 20:33.280* :  mugglers. It's 1,000 kilometers from north Sudan to Cairo across the dry Sahara. The land
*20:33.280- 20:40.220* :  escape is harsh and unforgiving and the journey long. But thousands of Sudanese are risking the
*20:40.220- 20:48.180* :  dangers to flee fighting at home. BBC Arabic has spoken to Sudanese refugees making the crossing
*20:48.180- 20:56.000* :  into Egypt, facilitated by people smugglers who charge high rates and can't guarantee safety.
*21:00.260- 21:06.980* :  Alema, who doesn't want to give her her name, is one of many who risk everything to live her
*21:07.340- 21:15.460* :  country. After fighting, escalated in her home state, she and her daughter decided their only
*21:15.460- 21:22.960* :  chance was to try to reach Cairo. They had hoped to travel legally, but they couldn't afford
*21:22.960- 21:31.480* :  the Egyptian visas. So instead, they put their faith in people's mugglers. It was a dangerous
*21:32.180- 21:38.080* :  decision. Alema describes what happened after her daughter was beaten by bandits.
*21:42.860- 21:48.300* :  They shot in the air and told us to get out of the car quickly. One of them slapped her and
*21:48.300- 21:54.360* :  snatched the earrings out of her ears. I told him not to hit her, just take the earrings.
*21:54.720- 21:58.900* :  Also, they took the money from the rest of the families we were with.
*22:04.880- 22:12.520* :  Like Halima, Iptisem, who also doesn't want to give her her name, tried to cross into Egypt
*22:13.160- 22:14.540* :  with the help of smugglers.
*22:15.920- 22:28.040* :  For three days, we had no food or water. We ran out of clean water and had to drink water,
*22:28.400- 22:34.560* :  which had been mixed with gasoline from bottles in the car. We had no choice but to give
*22:34.560- 22:40.320* :  these to the children too. We were tired of suffering and the children cried.
*22:41.480- 22:50.160* :  Most trips into Egypt start in the gold mining area of northern Sudan. The smugglers are often
*22:50.160- 22:58.160* :  gold miners, who charge as much as $300 for each person they take across.
*23:01.780- 23:06.720* :  Arriving in Cairo, the Sudanese apply for refugee status with the UN.
*23:07.720- 23:15.520* :  UNHCR's box person, Christine Bishai, says her organization can only do so much with limited
*23:16.180- 23:16.200* :  resources.
*23:20.140- 23:24.740* :  We have expanded our capacity by 900 percent. Of course, we realized that people's needs
*23:24.740- 23:30.200* :  are very large, greater than our ability to cover them. There are priorities, who is most in need.
*23:30.940- 23:34.740* :  Anybody has a problem during the trip, we try and provide them life-saving support,
*23:35.300- 23:39.020* :  so there are clinics where we provide medical service at the border through the red crescent.
*23:40.320- 23:47.840* :  Halima says that the stress of the attack was so great that when the eventually rich Cairo
*23:48.200- 23:49.780* :  hadota fell ill.
*23:53.280- 23:59.020* :  She felt short of breath. They put her on an oxygen device and she went into intensive care
*23:59.680- 24:00.360* :  than she died.
*24:02.400- 24:10.380* :  For the Sudanese, who make it safely into Egypt as recognized refugees, this is only the beginning.
*24:11.460- 24:16.540* :  They now have to face a difficult task of rebuilding their lives.
*24:17.300- 24:25.480* :  For the moment, any hope of going home is remote, as the fighting continues with no end inside.
*24:27.860- 24:31.720* :  That report by Mohammed Osman on the plight of Sudanese refugees.
*24:33.300- 24:38.120* :  Like many technology giants, Google has been developing its own version of artificial intelligence
*24:38.120- 24:42.920* :  called Gemini. It has an image generation feature. You tell it what you want it to draw,
*24:43.520- 24:48.520* :  but Gemini has had a rough few days. It didn't take long for people to discover that it somehow
*24:48.520- 24:53.840* :  appeared curiously progressive. When asked for a picture of the US founding fathers,
*24:53.840- 24:59.920* :  it produced men and women with different skin colors. Google have pulled that particular product,
*24:59.920- 25:06.540* :  but it's raised the question as to how far AI reflects values imposed on it by its creators.
*25:07.220- 25:12.500* :  The BBC's technology editor, Zoe Kleinman, explains the conundrum that Google finds itself in.
*25:13.340- 25:20.280* :  What Google is trying to do is to correct a really old problem, which is that there has traditionally
*25:20.280- 25:28.560* :  been so much bias expressed accidentally or not, but mainly accidentally by products over time.
*25:29.180- 25:35.680* :  For example, if you Google pictures of doctors, you're more likely to get loads of
*25:35.680- 25:40.280* :  pictures of men. If you Google pictures of babies, you're more likely to get lots of pictures
*25:40.280- 25:45.400* :  of white babies. We know that artificial intelligence is only as good as the data that it's
*25:45.400- 25:49.960* :  trained on. If it's being trained on data of thousands of pictures of doctors and they all look
*25:49.960- 25:54.640* :  like men, then if you ask it to show a picture of a doctor, it's going to assume that that doctor
*25:54.640- 26:00.440* :  is a man. I think Google is trying to do a slightly noble thing in trying to counter those
*26:00.440- 26:06.060* :  traditional biases, but it's kind of gone too far the other way, hasn't it? I mean, I was just
*26:06.060- 26:11.180* :  having a look online. The internet is littered with examples of Gemini gas today. I think it's
*26:11.180- 26:18.320* :  a tough time to be working at Google PR. We had somebody asking it whether Elon Musk posting memes on
*26:18.320- 26:23.940* :  X was worse than Hitler killing millions of people and Gemini replied, there's no right or wrong
*26:23.940- 26:30.560* :  answer. It's a great example of the limit of current AI, which is actually a very human thing.
*26:30.560- 26:36.140* :  You know, we understand nuance, don't we? And AI doesn't. It is literally predicting patterns
*26:36.140- 26:42.300* :  in vast amounts of data and it can be trained to avoid making certain connections if it's creators
*26:42.300- 26:47.000* :  don't want them to, but it's not sentient. It's not thinking for itself. It's a really interesting
*26:47.000- 26:52.540* :  lesson, isn't it? It being careful what you wish for. Zoe Kleinman, an investigation is underway
*26:52.540- 26:58.740* :  by India's railway authorities after a freight train traveled 70 kilometers without a driver.
*26:58.740- 27:05.300* :  The train had more than 50 wagons full of stone chips. After it left a station in Jemu and Kashmir,
*27:05.300- 27:11.540* :  it's been through five more before a hill managed to stop the runaway train. This man captured
*27:11.540- 27:20.020* :  the unusual sight. Look at the train. There's no driver. It's traveling on a stone.
*27:22.640- 27:28.480* :  New Lemagavans back to Arun Kumar Das, a freelance defense and railway journalist. So where were
*27:28.480- 27:34.880* :  the train drivers? Both the drivers went for a tea break and they put the brake and engine was
*27:34.880- 27:39.920* :  left in the running condition. They did not switch up the engine. They did not switch up the engine.
*27:41.500- 27:46.740* :  Generally, they don't switch up the engine during the short break. It takes a whole lot of time
*27:46.740- 27:51.780* :  to again restart and reboot it. They went for a quick tea break. They got the train the nearby
*27:51.780- 27:56.740* :  tea shop. They did not go out of the station. So all of a sudden, the train started moving.
*27:57.860- 28:04.100* :  And by the time they realized it picked up the speed and it went on. It went on till 70 kilometers.
*28:05.140- 28:09.700* :  And finally, it then stopped automatically because the gradient came. There was a slope.
*28:10.180- 28:15.180* :  But it went 70 kilometers. I mean, this is something that could have been very dangerous.
*28:15.700- 28:18.920* :  There is a malfunctioning of the brake. There is a failure of the braking system.
*28:18.920- 28:23.020* :  Yes, I understand. Because the cocktail, you know, unstoppable movement of Hollywood film.
*28:23.340- 28:25.700* :  So, it's in Hollywood, unstoppable? Yes.
*28:26.660- 28:32.900* :  Washington, it was that unstoppable movement. Right. Exactly. Seen by scene. So all the station
*28:32.900- 28:37.580* :  master was immediately told to give the green signal to this upcoming train.
*28:38.400- 28:42.080* :  And finally, when that slope came, that upward thing came, upward movement,
*28:42.080- 28:48.100* :  when that gradient came. So train stopped there. It could have been major disaster.
*28:48.400- 28:51.760* :  It could have been. But with God's grace, everything was saved. No,
*28:51.760- 28:55.960* :  casualty, no human lives were lost. Railway journalist Arun Kumar Das.
*28:56.820- 29:01.140* :  Finally, there's exciting news for fans of the popular film series, Bridget Jones.
*29:01.660- 29:05.940* :  Based on the books by the British author, Helen Fielding, the movies follow Bridget,
*29:05.940- 29:10.840* :  a hopeless romantic who documents the many ups and downs of her love life in her diary.
*29:11.480- 29:17.180* :  Now, more than two decades after the first movie was released, filming on a fourth installment
*29:17.180- 29:23.020* :  is due to begin soon. Here's how things ended for Bridget the last time she appeared on screen.
*29:31.600- 29:37.680* :  Yes. Smug? Well, it's about time, so maybe just a little.
*29:39.800- 29:45.780* :  So will the latest film be able to live up to the success of the franchise? Is the appeal still there?
*29:45.780- 29:52.100* :  Shantar Hartle has been taking a look. For some time there had been rumours that a fourth film had
*29:52.100- 29:57.700* :  been delayed due to the actor's strikes in Hollywood. But now, confirmation that the American actress
*29:57.700- 30:03.500* :  Renee Zellwiger is due to reprise her role as Bridget Jones. The character first appeared on
*30:03.500- 30:09.100* :  screen as a young woman in London, navigating messy relationships with two main love interests,
*30:09.700- 30:16.020* :  while trying to lose weight and maintain a career as a journalist. The first film released in 2001
*30:16.020- 30:24.100* :  was a huge box office success. It made $282 million worldwide. But there is no question about it.
*30:24.100- 30:30.720* :  Some of the scenes haven't aged well. Super. Thanks, Uncle G.
*30:30.920- 30:35.580* :  Still no further, eh? I don't know. You career, girls. Can't push it off really, no?
*30:37.640- 30:43.880* :  Speaking to the BBC in 2020, author Helen Fielding said she was surprised by how much sexism
*30:43.880- 30:49.780* :  Bridget experienced when she rewatched the earlier films. I was staggered. You couldn't
*30:49.780- 30:56.300* :  write that now. The hand on the bone in so many of the scenes. I mean, in the end she turned around
*30:56.300- 31:01.640* :  and stuck it to them. But it was just part and parcel of her life. And it was quite shocking
*31:01.640- 31:07.340* :  for me to see how things have changed since then. Then there's the context of modern dating and
*31:07.340- 31:12.060* :  just how different that looks from Bridget's romantic encounters of the early naughties.
*31:12.440- 31:18.560* :  Fast forward 23 years and Bridget is now a 51-year-old single mother to two young children
*31:19.040- 31:25.280* :  struggling with social media and dating apps. So can it still hold the same charm for fans?
*31:25.280- 31:32.680* :  Film critic Shavorn Sinat, isn't sure. It might bring in the millennium crowd or it might
*31:32.680- 31:37.140* :  have the feat of Indiana Jones and the Dan of Destiny where everybody thought that that was going
*31:37.140- 31:43.020* :  to bring in old fans to indulge in a bit of nostalgia but instead it lost Disney 100 million.
*31:43.620- 31:48.920* :  Few details have been released about the fourth movie but producers have teased a devastating
*31:48.920- 31:55.200* :  twist. It's also not known yet if Bridget's main love rivals played by Colin Firth and Hugh
*31:55.200- 32:00.520* :  Grant will star alongside Zellweger again. Shantel Hartel
*32:03.480- 32:07.200* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast
