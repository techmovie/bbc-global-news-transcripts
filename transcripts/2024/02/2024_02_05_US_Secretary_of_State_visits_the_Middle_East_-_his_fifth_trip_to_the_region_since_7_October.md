*01:13.740- 01:14.880* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:14.880- 01:19.140* :  This edition is recorded at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 5th of February.
*01:19.400- 01:22.880* :  America's top diplomat begins another crisis tour of the Middle East.
*01:22.880- 01:25.100* :  His fifth since the Gaza conflict began.
*01:25.800- 01:30.160* :  Police in Senegal used tear gas against protesters angered by a delay to elections.
*01:30.960- 01:37.060* :  And after clamping down on gang violence, President Naive Bukheli claims a record election victory in El Salvador.
*01:39.940- 01:44.460* :  Also in the podcast, a new warning that famine could be returning to Ethiopia.
*01:45.040- 01:47.340* :  Thousands of people are not in a position to fit themselves,
*01:47.340- 01:49.780* :  then they are succumbing to death because of starvation.
*01:50.240- 01:52.980* :  What transpired in 1985 would fail in comparison?
*01:57.700- 02:01.640* :  It is nearly four months since Hamas triggered the latest Gaza conflict
*02:01.640- 02:05.280* :  by carrying out the massacre in southern Israel on the 7th of October.
*02:05.820- 02:10.820* :  Since that day, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has visited the region four times.
*02:11.640- 02:16.140* :  Now he is back, trying to persuade Israel to reduce civilian deaths in Gaza
*02:16.140- 02:19.580* :  to put pressure on Hamas to release more Israeli hostages
*02:20.000- 02:22.740* :  and to prevent a wider regional conflict.
*02:23.420- 02:28.540* :  In the past 24 hours, Israel says it's killed dozens of Palestinian government in Gaza.
*02:28.540- 02:33.980* :  Tomas O'Della Longa from the Red Cross says people caught up in the fighting there need more help.
*02:34.600- 02:40.540* :  There is still some light and some hope with the two border crossing open.
*02:40.540- 02:44.140* :  The Kremlin won and the Rafa border with Egypt.
*02:44.940- 02:48.480* :  Now, the reality here is that he's still a drop in the ocean.
*02:48.480- 02:55.280* :  We are speaking about more than a million and 800,000 people internally displaced.
*02:56.020- 03:00.640* :  Only 30% of the health facilities still working or barely working,
*03:00.640- 03:06.940* :  so humanitarian needs are immense and the number of aid entering in Gaza's trip is not at all enough.
*03:07.700- 03:12.720* :  Well, over the weekend, the US attacked Iranian linked targets in Iraq and Syria,
*03:13.180- 03:14.980* :  as well as the Houthis in Yemen.
*03:15.780- 03:18.400* :  I spoke to our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher,
*03:18.400- 03:22.280* :  and asked him what Anthony Blinken will try to achieve on the visit as a whole
*03:22.780- 03:25.080* :  and on his first stop in Saudi Arabia.
*03:25.800- 03:29.880* :  I mean, the message isn't that different from the one that he's brought in the previous visits.
*03:29.880- 03:35.240* :  He's made to the region since October the 7th because essentially the situation hasn't changed.
*03:35.280- 03:40.020* :  The Israeli offensive against Hamas hasn't shown any sign of easing
*03:40.020- 03:46.340* :  and although there have been some positive signals over a potential cease-fire and a new
*03:46.340- 03:51.680* :  hostage deal, that hasn't yet resulted in anything that concrete,
*03:52.420- 03:56.580* :  and even those who are talking it up most like Qatar, which is one of the main mediators,
*03:57.300- 04:01.460* :  have said that it could still be weeks before something like that happened.
*04:01.460- 04:05.600* :  So, I mean, what Anthony Blinken is trying to do is to show that the US
*04:06.240- 04:12.640* :  is still very much trying to play a leading role in what happens as the key ally for Israel.
*04:12.640- 04:16.880* :  It's continued to support Israel's right to what it sees as a self-defense,
*04:16.880- 04:21.640* :  but it has increasingly said that it's unhappy about the way that Israel is carrying out this
*04:22.040- 04:24.400* :  in the numbers of civilians that have been killed.
*04:25.020- 04:31.460* :  That message in Saudi Arabia will be slightly also to do with the Saudis themselves,
*04:31.460- 04:35.420* :  although they're not the most active participants by any means in mediation efforts.
*04:35.420- 04:40.920* :  It has huge influence across the region and it was about or close to signing a potential
*04:40.920- 04:46.140* :  normalization deal with Israel. Saudi Arabia hasn't ruled that out, but it's raised its price over
*04:46.140- 04:51.780* :  that. It's a time saying that it wants a clear irrevocable path towards a two-state solution,
*04:52.260- 04:56.440* :  though more recently it's downplayed that slightly, saying it just wants much more
*04:56.440- 05:02.100* :  concerted progress if it's to make that deal. So, he'll be discussing what comes after what's
*05:02.100- 05:04.040* :  going on in Gaza as well as what's going on now.
*05:04.280- 05:07.120* :  Yeah, on the subject of Gaza, as well as the people dying,
*05:07.120- 05:11.480* :  and the US is also concerned about the humanitarian need to those who are still alive.
*05:11.480- 05:15.800* :  What is the latest from Israel's offensive? What is life like for people in Gaza?
*05:16.180- 05:17.860* :  Southern Gaza in particular at the moment?
*05:18.080- 05:21.840* :  Well, a situation there. I mean, this is where hundreds of thousands of
*05:21.840- 05:27.140* :  garsens have essentially fled from their homes further north, many of whom have now moved
*05:27.180- 05:31.460* :  several times, each time further south to places that Israel said are secure.
*05:32.120- 05:36.420* :  Now, attention, I mean, it's been on Harnunus, the main city down in the south.
*05:36.820- 05:41.740* :  That offensive continues. That's what Israel believes that much of Hamas leadership still holds
*05:41.740- 05:46.300* :  out, but it's also going towards Raffa, the city which is right on the border with Egypt, which was
*05:46.300- 05:52.520* :  seen as the place where people would be safe. We're hearing this morning, but there's artillery
*05:52.520- 05:56.660* :  fire that's been heard in the east of Raffa. So, that's a really major concern. We've seen
*05:56.660- 06:02.040* :  one of the past few days that Israel seems to be concentrating on what might happen in Raffa now.
*06:02.520- 06:08.200* :  I made a least analyst, Sebastian Asha. For two years, the Tigray region of Ethiopia was engulfed
*06:08.200- 06:12.880* :  by fighting between the Tigray people's liberation front and the central Ethiopian government,
*06:12.880- 06:19.320* :  backed by allies from Eritrea. 14 months on, there are growing fears of a famine in the region,
*06:19.320- 06:24.720* :  with the latest warning coming from a visiting British government minister. Andrew Mitchell said
*06:24.720- 06:30.260* :  there was every danger that Ethiopia would be engulfed by famine, unless urgent action was taken.
*06:30.260- 06:36.940* :  The Ethiopian government is almost 16 million people, a short of food. Gattaccio Redder is head of
*06:36.940- 06:42.920* :  the interim regional administration of Tigray. The one thing I know is that thousands of people who
*06:43.400- 06:48.440* :  would otherwise have been able to feed themselves are not in the position to feed themselves,
*06:48.440- 06:52.580* :  and they are succumbing to death because of starvation. Whether you call it famine,
*06:53.180- 06:57.020* :  or a risk of famine, or a potential famine, for me, it's purely academic.
*06:57.480- 07:02.860* :  Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel, traveled with Mr. Mitchell to Ethiopia and told me about
*07:02.860- 07:09.900* :  their visit. What we've seen is a mixed picture. Nobody really knows what's going on in the ground,
*07:09.900- 07:14.700* :  because there are parts of Ethiopia that are just inaccessible. It's hard to get media access.
*07:15.240- 07:19.540* :  There are areas that there are still some fighting going on. There are some areas that are
*07:19.540- 07:24.100* :  occupied by erotary enforcers, so it's hard for international agencies to get there.
*07:24.100- 07:29.620* :  The picture that has been built up is one of the compound anecdotal evidence of reports
*07:29.620- 07:35.400* :  coming in from different towns and villages and regions. What we learned is that we went to one
*07:36.660- 07:40.520* :  clinic in a place called Agulai, which is north of the Tigrayan capital, Mikaela.
*07:41.440- 07:47.380* :  There we talked to the nurses who were checking all the children that have been brought in by the
*07:47.380- 07:51.900* :  mother's food and nutrition, and the nurses there told us that all the numbers were going up.
*07:52.800- 07:58.540* :  They keep very, very tight control. They have a lot of mothers bringing their children in on a
*07:58.540- 08:03.000* :  fairly regular basis to try and get some kind of support and some kind of food into their children,
*08:03.480- 08:08.100* :  and they're measuring all the time. We had a look at their charts and the charts are going up.
*08:08.680- 08:14.280* :  We also went to a hospital in Mikaela, and the doctors there told us that the numbers
*08:14.980- 08:21.740* :  of admissions of children with severe acute malnutrition had doubled since the war began
*08:22.400- 08:27.380* :  in 2020, and even though the war is over, there's numbers are not coming down.
*08:27.760- 08:33.420* :  Yeah, over more than a year ago, but is this famine, potential famine, the result of the fighting
*08:33.420- 08:40.240* :  that we saw then? The fighting is one of the reasons. What you've got is an awful
*08:40.240- 08:48.080* :  confluence of two evils. One is successive droughts in parts of Ethiopia that have meant
*08:48.080- 08:53.960* :  that just crops have failed season after season. Many people attribute this to climate change.
*08:54.780- 09:00.060* :  That's one factor, but then also as you say, the fighting, although there was a ceasefire over a
*09:00.060- 09:07.220* :  year ago, despite that, there are still, it's estimated, about 4 million people in Ethiopia
*09:07.220- 09:11.180* :  who are still displaced from their homes. They can't go back because their homes are still
*09:11.180- 09:17.380* :  occupied by other forces and militias. They are sitting in camps and they are economically
*09:17.380- 09:21.340* :  unproductive. They can't go back to their homes to try and grow their own food and become more
*09:21.340- 09:29.060* :  resilient. If you add those two things together, you've got a fairly difficult economic situation
*09:29.120- 09:35.120* :  here. Government budgets are going down. You've got the international community distracted by
*09:35.120- 09:41.300* :  Middle East and Ukraine. Last year, international aid was suspended also for five months because
*09:41.820- 09:47.600* :  it emerged that huge amounts of aids were being siphoned off by the army. So those things together
*09:48.260- 09:53.120* :  are what are fueling this crisis. And as you say, people are saying that if the international
*09:53.120- 09:56.940* :  community does not act, then it will get worse. James Landel in Ethiopia.
*09:57.840- 10:02.860* :  The president of the Central American Nation of El Salvador says it is a record in the entire
*10:02.860- 10:09.920* :  democratic history of the world. Now, Bukkale claims to have won re-election with 85% of the vote,
*10:10.500- 10:14.840* :  even though official results have not been released. Mr. Bukkale would be the first president
*10:14.840- 10:20.280* :  to serve a second consecutive term in El Salvador since the end of military rule more than four
*10:20.280- 10:26.500* :  decades ago. Opinion Paul suggests he is popular as a result of his war on gangs, but he's faced
*10:26.500- 10:31.840* :  criticism over human rights violations. Our correspondent Will Grant reports from El Salvador.
*10:32.940- 10:40.040* :  To chance of five more years from his supporters outside, President Bukkale cast his ballot in
*10:40.040- 10:44.820* :  a polling station in San Salvador. And from the start, there's been little doubt that he will
*10:44.820- 10:52.420* :  indeed be granted exactly that in this election another five-year term. His re-election bid has been
*10:52.420- 10:57.500* :  criticized by his critics for having been approved by loyalists that he appointed to the Supreme
*10:57.500- 11:03.640* :  Court's constitutional chamber. It seems most voters didn't care and simply wanted to see him
*11:03.640- 11:09.620* :  remain in power. In large part, he's won their support for a draconian gang crackdown he ordered two
*11:09.620- 11:15.220* :  years ago, which has seen some 75,000 people arrested, but which has transformed the security
*11:15.220- 11:21.120* :  situation in El Salvador. At a news conference after voting, Mr. Bukkale dismissed human rights concerns
*11:29.840- 11:36.360* :  over his security policy. The vote itself appeared to go off peacefully around the country with very
*11:36.360- 11:43.380* :  few reports of any irregularities. I'm in the voting centre in Kital de Bicke just about half an hour
*11:43.860- 11:52.280* :  outside San Salvador and this is where the leader of the left-wing FMLN party cast his ballot
*11:52.280- 11:58.340* :  a little earlier. There is a steady stream of voters coming in and an atmosphere of calm and
*11:58.340- 12:06.000* :  security, uneventful, if you like, in a good way. In the run up to the vote, Mr. Bukkale's rivals
*12:06.000- 12:11.460* :  were always a distant second. One of them was the FMLN's candidate Manuel Flores.
*12:11.460- 12:17.440* :  We're seeing not just social media, but among the people that the direction this country is
*12:17.440- 12:22.460* :  heading is going to change and it will bring happiness, enthusiasm and dynamism. It's going to
*12:22.460- 12:27.960* :  take young people from a place of darkness to one of strength. By and large, Bukkale's supporters
*12:27.960- 12:32.740* :  were calling for an extension of the military-led security crackdown, while the president's opponents
*12:32.740- 12:35.960* :  voted over what they see as worsening authoritarianism.
*12:36.380- 12:45.240* :  Before we couldn't move around easily through fear, fear of being physically hurt,
*12:46.220- 12:50.360* :  but now we have this president who is governing in the way that God intends.
*12:56.080- 13:00.260* :  In a democracy, I'm not sure about all these things the president's been doing in his first
*13:00.320- 13:05.780* :  term. I don't want him to have a second term. It's unconstitutional. He'll be an unconstitutional
*13:05.780- 13:14.860* :  president. With a huge majority in his favour, President Bukkale will feel more endorsed and
*13:14.860- 13:20.320* :  stronger than ever in his position. In a second term, he will need to tackle difficult questions
*13:20.320- 13:25.780* :  of where his controversial security policy goes from here and how to revitalise the economy.
*13:26.500- 13:30.700* :  For now, though, his supporters are just thankful that he'll be El Salvador's president for a
*13:30.700- 13:36.620* :  second term with an unprecedented level of support. Now, to Senegal, where people are angry at
*13:36.620- 13:49.360* :  President Maki Sal's decision to delay the election. Right police in Senegal fired tear gas at
*13:49.360- 13:54.740* :  protesters outside Parliament in the capital Daka. These demonstrators denounce the
*13:54.740- 13:58.920* :  besponement. They're planning on keeping power for another six months. It's just a big
*13:58.920- 14:03.360* :  thing. They're going to go on and on and on and on. Everything we want is a fair election.
*14:04.260- 14:09.460* :  Election, that's all we want. We deserve freedom. We have been a peaceful country,
*14:09.460- 14:15.220* :  democratic country, and this president is not allowed to take our freedom.
*14:16.880- 14:20.200* :  The authorities also cut mobile phone and internet access.
*14:20.940- 14:24.020* :  Africa, regional editor Richard Hamilton is following developments.
*14:24.760- 14:29.520* :  So the latest is that about a hundred people had gathered outside the national assembly
*14:29.520- 14:36.500* :  and the army had sent in tanks and riot police, as you say, used tear gas to disperse the protesters.
*14:37.180- 14:43.380* :  And the internet was cut. The communications minister said this was to stop the dissemination
*14:43.380- 14:50.620* :  of hateful and subversive messages on social media amid a context of threats of disturbances
*14:50.620- 14:57.140* :  to public order. So they clearly wanted to stop people organizing more protests as there had been
*14:57.140- 15:02.100* :  on Sunday, which had turned quite violent, and one opposition politician was arrested.
*15:02.700- 15:07.740* :  The cutting of the internet has been condemned by the local branch of Amnesty International,
*15:08.380- 15:11.960* :  and it seems that this political crisis is just getting worse and worse.
*15:12.360- 15:15.040* :  Yeah, why have the elections been postponed?
*15:16.000- 15:20.920* :  So it's quite complicated, but President Mackie Sal had been in power for two terms,
*15:20.920- 15:25.960* :  and he had long delayed announcing whether he would run for a third term.
*15:26.640- 15:30.340* :  And this caused a lot of uncertainty, and there were a lot of protests by the opposition.
*15:30.780- 15:35.940* :  And then in July, he said he wouldn't run for a third term, and everyone sort of breathed
*15:35.940- 15:40.480* :  to sigh of relief, and this was widely welcomed. But then there was this shock announcement
*15:40.480- 15:45.700* :  on Saturday saying that the poll, which was due on the 25th of February, would be delayed.
*15:45.700- 15:51.520* :  And he didn't really give very clear reasons, but it's thought to be a dispute between the national
*15:51.520- 15:57.540* :  assembly and the constitutional court over the eligibility of candidates. And on Saturday,
*15:57.540- 16:03.240* :  Mackie Sal said, I will begin an open national dialogue to bring together the conditions for a
*16:03.240- 16:08.780* :  free, transparent, and inclusive election. But he didn't really go into the details of why he
*16:08.780- 16:14.800* :  took this decision. But critics are saying that he wasn't sure that his nominated successor,
*16:14.840- 16:19.900* :  Amadou Bah, who's the Prime Minister, would actually win this election. So in effect,
*16:19.900- 16:24.060* :  he's just pulled the plug, and critics are calling it a constitutional coup.
*16:24.600- 16:29.740* :  Now, some of the main candidates that are not allowed to run are the son of the former President
*16:29.740- 16:34.820* :  Karim Wards, so he's the son of Abdullah Wards, and the constitutional court had rejected
*16:34.820- 16:41.420* :  his candidacy saying that he was half French. And then the other very popular opposition figure
*16:41.420- 16:48.220* :  is Usman Tsonko, who's prevented from running as well. And he says that various court cases against
*16:48.260- 16:52.600* :  him are politically motivated. Africa, regional editor, Richard Hamilton.
*16:55.220- 16:59.480* :  Still to come on the global news podcast. I would love to tell you that this is the best moment
*16:59.480- 17:05.660* :  of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song. Taylor Swift wins
*17:05.660- 17:09.160* :  album of the year at the Grammys for a record fourth time.
*17:16.340- 17:21.140* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*17:21.180- 17:27.320* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*17:28.100- 17:33.180* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave,
*17:33.340- 17:41.540* :  forced out. I'm Una Chaplin, and from CBC podcasts and the BBC World Service, this is Hollywood
*17:41.540- 17:46.660* :  Exiles. Search for Hollywood Exiles, wherever you get your podcasts.
*17:47.980- 17:53.740* :  After several difficult years, diplomatic relations between Australia and China were on the
*17:53.740- 17:58.280* :  mend, following a high profile visit to Beijing in November by the Australian Prime Minister
*17:58.560- 18:04.900* :  Anthony Albanese. But there is renewed tension after an Australian blogger was sentenced to death.
*18:04.940- 18:11.220* :  The Chinese born young horned June was arrested on espionage charges on a rare trip back to China
*18:11.220- 18:16.900* :  five years ago. The sentence, announced three years after a secret trial, will be commuted
*18:16.900- 18:22.120* :  to life in prison if no further crimes are committed, but the writer is ill at the moment.
*18:22.880- 18:26.480* :  Elaine Pearson from the campaign group Human Rights Watch criticized the verdict.
*18:27.040- 18:32.020* :  This is really an outrageous sentencing that someone could be given a suspended dead sentence.
*18:32.840- 18:37.360* :  What we've seen in this case is myriad due process violations from start to finish.
*18:38.140- 18:45.960* :  Yang himself has alleged torture, forced confessions, particularly in the earlier period of interrogations.
*18:46.420- 18:52.880* :  He had delayed access to legal representation, limited access to a lawyer, Australian diplomats were
*18:52.880- 18:57.780* :  also prevented from entering the courtroom. Well, China said Australia's consular rights were
*18:57.780- 19:02.120* :  respected and that the case had been tried in strict accordance with the law.
*19:02.620- 19:07.560* :  Are Beijing correspondents Stephen McDonald told me what he made of the sentence and its timing?
*19:08.160- 19:14.320* :  Well, certainly the sentence when the family, if you ask the family what their attitude
*19:14.320- 19:20.720* :  to the sentence is, shocked and devastated by the news, which they described as at the extreme
*19:20.720- 19:26.820* :  end of worst expectations. So he's been given the harshest of possible penalties,
*19:27.740- 19:31.260* :  and you wonder what it is that he's supposed to have done to warrant this.
*19:31.260- 19:37.580* :  Now, young and June Australian citizen born in China and previously worked for the Chinese
*19:37.580- 19:43.900* :  government years ago. So I guess when it comes to the state security apparatus here,
*19:43.900- 19:49.980* :  they seem as a bit of a traitor. And I think, you know, they're known to be very hard line.
*19:50.920- 19:57.500* :  And so five years after him initially being picked up, he's finally sentenced,
*19:58.340- 20:01.700* :  and they wouldn't care less about the impact that has on China-Australia relations,
*20:01.800- 20:07.600* :  because for them, I guess getting tough is the natural response to this type of thing.
*20:08.300- 20:12.440* :  But you'd have to wonder what the Chinese government does from here on in, because it is going
*20:12.440- 20:16.900* :  to really hurt China-Australia relations again. Yeah, I mean, is it a case of back-to-square-one
*20:16.900- 20:22.560* :  for those relations which were slowly warming? Well, neither side's going to want that,
*20:22.560- 20:27.820* :  but, you know, I mean, if you've got someone there who, the Australian government has clearly
*20:27.820- 20:33.840* :  been calling for this person to be released, and then they're given a death sentence, suspended
*20:33.840- 20:40.620* :  death sentence, but nevertheless a death sentence. I don't know if it'll go back to where it was,
*20:40.620- 20:45.140* :  but certainly it's going to put tensions back on things. That's for sure.
*20:45.580- 20:53.880* :  Now, young Han Jun had been detained in China before and released back in 2011 after representations
*20:54.060- 21:00.460* :  from Australia. I mean, one wonders why he returned there after he'd been so outspoken
*21:00.460- 21:04.940* :  against the Chinese authorities. Yeah, well, it's a very good question, and some would say,
*21:04.940- 21:08.980* :  really, he shouldn't have gone back there. I guess after he was released that time, possibly,
*21:08.980- 21:13.920* :  thought everything's okay again. He's writing these blogs, his criticising the Chinese government
*21:13.920- 21:19.100* :  over human rights abuses and what have you, and the fact that he was released once, he must have
*21:19.100- 21:24.100* :  thought, well, it's all okay then. And after all his Chinese, he wants to go back to his homeland,
*21:24.100- 21:30.100* :  to visit friends and family, but as it turned out, it was the wrong thing for him to have done,
*21:30.100- 21:35.740* :  because now, after five years in prison, apparently, his health is really deteriorating and his
*21:35.740- 21:41.640* :  family say it even could potentially be life threatening. They're worried that he could die in jail
*21:41.640- 21:47.520* :  after this. Stephen McDonald in Beijing. The European centre for particle research,
*21:47.520- 21:52.840* :  Sun, is already home to the world's biggest atom smasher, the large Hadron Collider.
*21:53.260- 21:58.100* :  Now, it wants to build a new machine that will be three times larger. Our science correspondent
*21:58.100- 22:05.940* :  Palabgos has been to visit. Wow. Is it the Atlas experiment or, as I mentioned, a very small section of it?
*22:06.480- 22:12.660* :  Welcome to the Atlas detector, a hundred metres below Geneva. It's huge, it's massive.
*22:13.000- 22:17.180* :  Jamie Penel is showing me a metal cylinder, the size of a shipping tanker.
*22:17.560- 22:23.660* :  This detector is 42 metres long, it's 26 metres wide, and we're in a cabin 30 metres wide.
*22:24.160- 22:29.000* :  No, that does not leave a lot of room for us. This is actually the world's largest ship in a bottle
*22:29.000- 22:34.940* :  when it comes to assembling all of this together. Atlas is one of four huge underground detectors
*22:35.500- 22:41.620* :  joined by an even more gigantic cube. Together, they make up the world's largest particle accelerator.
*22:42.220- 22:48.180* :  The large Hadron Collider, or LHC for short. In the map, we see the future
*22:48.180- 22:53.140* :  circular collider. It's so much bigger. It's three times bigger.
*22:53.660- 23:01.360* :  On the surface, CERN's Director-General Professor Fabiola Genotti tells me that she needs an even larger particle accelerator.
*23:01.960- 23:09.020* :  We need a larger collider because there are so many outstanding questions in fundamental physics
*23:09.020- 23:14.760* :  today, and in our knowledge of the universe, its structure and its evolution, for which we have
*23:14.760- 23:21.380* :  no answer, and so we need more powerful instruments to be able to addressing those questions.
*23:21.760- 23:25.600* :  These bottles, 15 years of history, but these bottles are representing miles.
*23:25.600- 23:33.120* :  The LHC's control room, Professor Rendez Stenberg, shows me a row of 100 bottles of champagne and wine.
*23:34.000- 23:40.140* :  Each one celebrating a landmark discovery, and in amongst them is a solitary bottle of whiskey.
*23:41.120- 23:45.300* :  Let me take one of these bottles, so if I take this bottle here, so that's the Higgs.
*23:45.540- 23:50.100* :  That's the Higgs single malt. They're still the Nettinburg matured at CERN.
*23:50.860- 23:55.900* :  The Higgs boson was detected in 2012, and was the LHC's biggest breakthrough.
*23:56.680- 24:01.100* :  The Higgs is a particle that gives everything in the universe its mass and form,
*24:01.560- 24:05.140* :  but its discovery didn't answer what most of the universe is made of.
*24:05.560- 24:09.900* :  The particles we know about explain how only 5% of the universe works,
*24:10.600- 24:13.580* :  which is why Professor Gianotti says she needs a larger machine.
*24:14.080- 24:19.840* :  95% of the universe being a question mark, it's something big, we are missing something big.
*24:20.200- 24:25.020* :  Her proposal is to build what's called the FCC, the future circular collider,
*24:25.560- 24:31.300* :  next to the existing accelerator. It'll be at least twice as deep, and 91 kilometres around,
*24:31.300- 24:35.820* :  that's three times a circumference. The extra distance means that the
*24:35.820- 24:40.840* :  particle's inside will have more energy, and so crash into each other even harder.
*24:42.140- 24:47.060* :  Back at the experiments underground, Professor Mitesh Patel of Imperial College London
*24:47.060- 24:53.160* :  tells me that this increases the chances of discovering those particles that make up the missing
*24:53.160- 24:58.900* :  95% of the universe. We will have a complete revelation. We will find something that doesn't really
*24:58.900- 25:04.280* :  fit in the picture that we thought it should do, and that that will result in us completely
*25:04.280- 25:11.440* :  co-returning our understanding of how all of it sits together. There seems to be kind of cracks
*25:12.420- 25:18.220* :  appearing in this wonderful model. I'm excited about the cracks appearing, the cracks we hope will
*25:18.220- 25:25.840* :  turn into chasms. The FCC isn't a done deal, planners have to prove that it can be built with
*25:25.840- 25:32.040* :  minimal environmental disruption, and then there's a cost around 20 billion euros for the initial
*25:32.040- 25:37.940* :  phase, a price tag that's earned 70 member nations will have to decide whether they can afford.
*25:38.820- 25:43.780* :  But the researchers here feel that they're within reach of finding the new particles that really
*25:43.780- 25:49.880* :  make the universe tick. One more heave they say, and they could make one of the biggest breakthroughs
*25:50.140- 25:57.080* :  of all time. Palab goes reporting from Surn. At least 10 police officers have been killed after
*25:57.080- 26:02.520* :  militants stormed a police station in the northwest of Pakistan. The attack involving hand grenades
*26:02.520- 26:07.080* :  and sniper fire comes as violence escalates ahead of the general election on Thursday.
*26:07.620- 26:11.300* :  Our correspondent in Islamabad Caroline Davis gave me the details.
*26:11.960- 26:15.920* :  We know that this attack happened around three o'clock in the morning according to the deputy
*26:15.920- 26:21.380* :  superintendent there. As you say, the militants came in firstly using sniper fire. They then
*26:21.380- 26:27.060* :  used grenades once they got inside the building, which we understand then caused more injuries and
*26:27.080- 26:32.840* :  more death as well. Now, apparently according to the superintendent, there was an exchange of fire
*26:32.840- 26:38.340* :  between the militants and between the police, which lasted over two and a half hours. The police
*26:38.340- 26:43.520* :  now say that they have got the police station back, but at one stage they did lose control of it to
*26:43.520- 26:47.960* :  the militant group. 10 police officers have been killed. We were told directly by the
*26:47.980- 26:53.020* :  deputy superintendent that nine have been injured. The key thing at this stage is that we don't
*26:53.020- 27:00.200* :  know who has carried out the attack. We haven't seen a claim yet. The area has seen attacks before,
*27:00.200- 27:07.540* :  quite often security forces are targeted. So army police by militant groups, quite often by
*27:07.540- 27:12.160* :  Islamic state or affiliates of Islamic state or the Pakistani Taliban or affiliates of the
*27:12.160- 27:17.800* :  Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups too. As I say, we don't know who is claiming this
*27:17.860- 27:22.360* :  particular attack at the moment. The Pakistani Taliban at the moment seem to be distancing themselves
*27:22.360- 27:26.700* :  from it, but we're keeping an eye to see who will come forward and say that they were responsible.
*27:27.260- 27:32.100* :  So do we know if it's related to the election and whether it is or not are the authorities
*27:32.100- 27:36.580* :  taking action to prevent further violence ahead of that vote? So the elections are happening
*27:36.580- 27:42.600* :  from Thursday onwards. It's very difficult to know without knowing who carried this out to know
*27:42.600- 27:46.400* :  for certain whether this was related to the election. We didn't get anything from the police
*27:47.020- 27:53.700* :  directly saying that, but we have seen a rise in violence in the run-up to the elections on Wednesday.
*27:53.700- 27:58.780* :  There was actually another attack as well on a national assembly candidate who was shot dead.
*27:58.780- 28:03.660* :  There were attacks that have happened in Baluchistan, including at an election office and a bomb
*28:03.660- 28:08.460* :  attack that happened at a political rally. But police and the authorities have said that they are
*28:08.460- 28:12.240* :  going to make sure that there is strong security, particularly on election day as well.
*28:12.700- 28:17.540* :  First line of defences, police-based stations, but we also understand that the military will be
*28:17.540- 28:22.380* :  involved as well, trying to provide additional protection to give people some form of security,
*28:22.380- 28:26.380* :  because obviously in a run-up to an election, people don't feel safe voting that has a major
*28:26.380- 28:29.240* :  effect on how free and fair these elections are seems being.
*28:29.600- 28:34.820* :  Caroline Davis in Pakistan. One of Australia's most respected Aboriginal leaders,
*28:34.820- 28:41.180* :  Luija O'Donohue, has died at the age of 91. She spent her life advocating for the health and
*28:41.180- 28:46.220* :  rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Celia Hatton looks back at her life.
*28:46.920- 28:52.360* :  Luija O'Donohue was taken from her Aboriginal mother by the authorities at the age of two
*28:52.360- 28:57.500* :  and placed in care, forbidden to speak her own language or to ask about her background.
*28:58.240- 29:02.900* :  At 18, she fought to become a nurse. She excelled in the nursing profession,
*29:02.900- 29:08.700* :  but her life changed when she was recognized by some Aboriginal patients and finally learned
*29:08.760- 29:14.120* :  about her own family, meeting her mother again more than 30 years after she'd been taken.
*29:14.960- 29:18.900* :  She then devoted her life advocating for the health and rights of Aboriginal
*29:18.900- 29:24.720* :  and Torres Strait Islander people and was celebrated as Australian of the year in 1984.
*29:27.100- 29:30.860* :  Luija O'Donohue, who's died at the age of 91.
*29:32.020- 29:35.800* :  Taylor Swift has made history at the Grammys, becoming the first artist to win
*29:35.800- 29:41.100* :  album of the year for a fourth time. The night was dominated by female artists as
*29:41.100- 29:42.960* :  Emma Vardy reports from the red carpet.
*29:43.400- 29:49.040* :  It's the 66th annual Grammy Awards and tonight we're coming to you live from the city of
*29:49.040- 29:53.120* :  Los Angeles where the local population has just survived the unthinkable grain.
*29:54.140- 29:58.480* :  As a storm battered L.A., there was shelter for the stars on the red carpet.
*29:59.020- 30:02.580* :  While inside the arena, the awards rained down for female artists.
*30:08.260- 30:13.580* :  Miley Cyrus picked up two Grammys for her hit flowers and gave the crowd a little more than they
*30:13.580- 30:19.420* :  bargained for. Thank you all so much. I don't think I forgot anyone, but I might have forgotten
*30:26.100- 30:29.220* :  underwear. Bye. While it was Billie Eilish who won song of the year with her hit,
*30:29.220- 30:31.680* :  what was I made for from the Barbie soundtrack.
*30:35.480- 30:40.520* :  It's rare an award ceremony goes off without a little controversy and Jay-Z used his speech
*30:40.520- 30:44.980* :  to criticise the recording academy for repeatedly failing to give the top prize
*30:44.980- 30:50.300* :  album of the year to his wife Beyonce as he picked up the Dr. Drake Lodge Impact Award.
*30:50.300- 30:54.000* :  I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never
*30:54.000- 30:58.360* :  won out of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.
*30:58.780- 31:03.680* :  Cesar was the most nominated artist going into the Grammys and she won three, including
*31:03.680- 31:11.100* :  Best R and B song for snooze. I came really, really far and I can't believe this is happening,
*31:11.100- 31:18.980* :  and it feels very fake. And I'm the high-tailer. I love you.
*31:20.600- 31:25.200* :  And there was a lot more love for Taylor Swift, who won album of the year for Midnight's
*31:25.340- 31:30.240* :  becoming the first artist in history to win the top prize four times, putting her
*31:30.240- 31:34.540* :  beyond the three-time winners, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon.
*31:35.220- 31:40.300* :  I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy
*31:40.940- 31:45.960* :  when I finish a song, or when I crack the code to a bridge that I love, or when I'm shot
*31:45.960- 31:52.420* :  listing a music video, or when I'm rehearsing with my dancers, or my band, or getting ready to go
*31:52.420- 31:56.420* :  to Tokyo to play a show. For me, the award is the work.
*32:10.980- 32:13.640* :  This was a moment many fans never thought they'd see.
*32:14.240- 32:18.380* :  Joni Mitchell, performing for the first time at the Grammys at 80 years old,
*32:18.740- 32:22.680* :  a remarkable comeback after almost losing her life to a brain aneurysm.
*32:22.800- 32:38.860* :  I looked at life from both sides now, come with them loose, and we're still some.
*32:38.960- 32:44.000* :  With major wins and powerful performances, this was a Grammys in which women were sent to
*32:44.040- 32:45.840* :  stage across several generations.
*32:45.900- 32:52.340* :  Joni Mitchell ending that report by Emma Vardy.
*32:55.180- 32:59.200* :  And that is all from us for now, but the Global News Podcast will be back very soon.
*32:59.200- 33:02.620* :  This edition was mixed by Martin Baker and produced by Stephanie Tillerson.
*33:02.620- 33:06.620* :  Our editor is Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
