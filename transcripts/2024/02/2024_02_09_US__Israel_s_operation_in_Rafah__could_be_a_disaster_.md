*01:33.800- 01:39.100* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Friday, the 9th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:39.580- 01:44.140* :  The US warns Israel against going ahead with its military offensive into the southern
*01:44.140- 01:49.460* :  Garzen city of Raffa. We would not support the undertaking of something like this without
*01:49.460- 01:54.180* :  serious and credible planning. Ukraine's top general Valorysa Luzni gets the sack.
*01:55.460- 01:59.120* :  Today, I have decided to renew the leadership of the armed forces of Ukraine.
*02:01.660- 02:06.820* :  And a police investigation into whether there was a coup attempt after Brazil's last election
*02:07.240- 02:09.980* :  gets ever closer to former President Bolsonaro.
*02:12.980- 02:18.160* :  Also in this podcast, the UN warns of a deepening crisis in Mongolia where extreme
*02:18.160- 02:21.320* :  weather has devastated livestock hurts. And
*02:24.660- 02:29.980* :  it's one of those songs where everyone who was alive in around the 1980s immediately
*02:29.980- 02:33.840* :  goes back to where they were in 1988. But kids love it too.
*02:34.340- 02:37.620* :  Why fast car by Tracy Chapman is making a comeback.
*02:42.700- 02:48.600* :  For much of the past four months, the US has been urging Israel to avoid civilian deaths in Gaza.
*02:48.600- 02:54.340* :  But now the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he has ordered the Israeli army
*02:54.340- 02:58.780* :  to move into the southern city of Raffa where there are one and a half million people.
*02:58.780- 03:03.820* :  The US State Department spokesman Bedanta Patel said this would be a disaster.
*03:04.420- 03:08.660* :  We would not support the undertaking of something like this without serious and credible
*03:08.660- 03:15.280* :  planning as it relates to the more than a million people who are sheltering there as well as
*03:15.280- 03:20.320* :  without considering the impacts on humanitarian assistance and the safe departure of foreign
*03:20.320- 03:26.240* :  nationals. I asked our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman how rare an intervention this is for
*03:26.240- 03:32.260* :  the US. It's very unusual whenever the State Department or the National Security Council
*03:32.260- 03:38.180* :  spokesman are asked about what Israel may be planning to do in Gaza that the usual replies or
*03:38.180- 03:42.820* :  we don't speculate on things that's for the Israelis to be asked or they're not going to sort of
*03:42.820- 03:50.080* :  telegraph Israel's military actions. So what we had here was very pointedly at the same time the
*03:50.080- 03:53.960* :  deputy spokesman at the State Department, the spokesman at the National Security Council at the
*03:53.960- 04:01.220* :  White House talking about the fact that any unplanned operation of this kind would be in their
*04:01.220- 04:06.200* :  words a disaster. And the key point they're making is that there are the best part of one and a half
*04:06.200- 04:12.100* :  million people in Raffa. Many of them are simply living in tents or in the open air. It's the
*04:12.100- 04:17.420* :  middle of winter. The conditions have been absolutely diabolical and so for there to be a major
*04:17.420- 04:21.260* :  military assault in those conditions where there have been no effort to evacuate anyone would
*04:21.260- 04:27.180* :  clearly be disastrous. Benjamin Netanyahu said that if this happened it would be within the
*04:27.180- 04:31.360* :  bounds of international law and there would be an evacuation. The US can issue a warning but will
*04:31.360- 04:35.640* :  Israel pay any attention? I mean that's a very good question and I think the fact they're saying
*04:35.640- 04:41.280* :  it publicly is a sign really of the sort of growing irritation and frustration that Anthony Blinken
*04:41.280- 04:47.180* :  has about some of the things he's been trying to get the Israelis to do not being heated. So that
*04:47.180- 04:52.400* :  may be an example of what we've seen in the past is things not being listened to. During his trip
*04:52.400- 04:57.020* :  to the Middle East over the last week there was sort of increasingly the sense or an accusation
*04:57.020- 05:02.780* :  that he wasn't able to get to use leverage with the Israelis and not able to get some of the things
*05:03.260- 05:07.400* :  delivered on that the US wants. Now what the US always says is you know they have got more
*05:07.400- 05:12.600* :  aid into Gaza. That's a result of US initiative pressure on the Israelis that has had an effect
*05:12.600- 05:17.520* :  but clearly on that much bigger picture of this just the catastrophic scale of civilian deaths
*05:17.520- 05:25.420* :  in Gaza the factor remains the message isn't getting through. Tom Bateman. Donald Trump is facing
*05:25.420- 05:30.720* :  numerous legal cases in the month leading up to the US presidential election but the most
*05:30.720- 05:36.520* :  important one is probably his attempt to stop states banning him from the ballot on the allegation
*05:36.520- 05:42.420* :  that he engaged in insurrection when his supporters stormed the US Capitol to stop Joe Biden being
*05:42.420- 05:47.780* :  sworn in. His lawyers have been arguing in front of the supreme court to keep him on the ballot.
*05:48.200- 05:53.900* :  Here's one of the justices Katanji Brown Jackson questioning Mr. Trump's lawyer Jonathan Mitchell.
*05:54.540- 05:59.080* :  For an insurrection there needs to be an organized concerted effort to overthrow the government of
*05:59.080- 06:03.620* :  the United States through violence. So the point is that a chaotic effort to overthrow the
*06:03.620- 06:06.880* :  government is not an insurrection. We didn't concede that it's an effort to overthrow the
*06:06.880- 06:10.860* :  government either Justice Jackson right. None of these criteria were met. This was a riot.
*06:10.860- 06:16.140* :  It was not an insurrection. Our Washington correspondent Gary O'Donohue told me more about
*06:16.140- 06:22.780* :  the hearing. The more testy parts were directed towards the council for the state of Colorado
*06:22.780- 06:30.380* :  and interestingly even some of the or liberal justices seem very skeptical about their case
*06:30.380- 06:36.740* :  particularly this idea that somehow Donald Trump president is one of those cases where
*06:37.220- 06:42.240* :  insurrection should be used as a disqualifying factor even though the constitutional clause at
*06:42.240- 06:47.980* :  state doesn't mention the president which is a bit of a problem for Colorado. But also in questioning
*06:47.980- 06:53.920* :  whether Colorado jumped the gun a bit and whether they had the right to determine what should
*06:53.920- 06:58.700* :  happen effectively across the country because while Colorado is saying we just want to do this in our
*06:58.700- 07:03.800* :  place they know this gets confirmed by the supreme court it would disqualify effectively Donald
*07:03.800- 07:07.240* :  Trump everywhere. But does this mean that we're getting a sense of where this is going?
*07:07.540- 07:13.180* :  I think so the justices go away now and think about it and then there'll be you know decision
*07:13.220- 07:19.440* :  of the court on a basis of a majority and they will do that in pretty short order because the
*07:19.440- 07:24.500* :  Republican primary is on March 5th and they will be all too aware that voters in that state need
*07:24.500- 07:29.000* :  to know whether or not Donald Trump's name which will be on the ballot whether any votes for him
*07:29.000- 07:35.480* :  will be counted so if today is anything to go by I'd be very surprised if they are upheld
*07:35.480- 07:42.580* :  Colorado's ban on Donald Trump. Gary O'Donohue. In Brazil and investigation into whether the
*07:42.580- 07:48.460* :  government of Jair Bolsonaro tried to plot a military takeover after losing the 2022 election
*07:48.460- 07:54.220* :  is now targeting some of the former president's closest allies including a former justice minister
*07:54.220- 07:58.880* :  and high-ranking military officers. Federal police carried out dozens of searches
*07:59.360- 08:03.740* :  and have arrested four people in the deepening investigation into the attempted coup
*08:03.740- 08:09.740* :  on the 8th of January last year. President Luis in ACO Lula de Silva said the coup attempt
*08:09.740- 08:16.580* :  wouldn't have happened without Mr. Bolsonaro. He wasn't ready to win. He wasn't prepared to lose.
*08:16.580- 08:21.480* :  He wasn't prepared to leave so much so that he didn't even have the courage to say congratulations.
*08:22.180- 08:27.640* :  He went home crying and traveled to the United States because he must have participated in this
*08:27.640- 08:33.420* :  coup attempt. Our South America correspondent Aany Wells has more details. In January last year
*08:33.420- 08:38.700* :  supporters of Jair Bolsonaro stormed and vandalized the Congress Supreme Court and parts of the
*08:38.700- 08:44.100* :  presidential palace in Brazil after he lost the election to his left-wing rival Lula de Silva
*08:44.100- 08:49.680* :  and disputed the result. This investigation is considering whether Mr. Bolsonaro and his closest
*08:49.680- 08:55.280* :  aides and ministers were responsible for inciting the attempted coup. In a statement police said
*08:55.280- 09:00.560* :  some of those under investigation were suspected of spreading claims of electoral fraud even before
*09:00.560- 09:05.580* :  the election took place to legitimize a military intervention. The former president has been
*09:05.580- 09:10.760* :  ordered to hand his passport over to the authorities. He's insisted he's the innocent victim of a
*09:10.760- 09:16.440* :  politically motivated operation. This is just one of a number of investigations into Jair Bolsonaro
*09:16.440- 09:21.420* :  and his allies. Others are looking into the former president's attacks on Brazil's election system
*09:21.420- 09:26.960* :  and covid vaccines as well as foreign gifts he received. Mr. Bolsonaro has already been banned
*09:26.960- 09:31.060* :  from running for office for eight years over his attempts to undermine the voting system.
*09:31.480- 09:38.280* :  Aany Wells. After weeks of speculation, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has fired his top
*09:38.280- 09:43.420* :  general as part of an effort to shake up the military. This was how he confirmed the dismissal
*09:43.420- 09:50.060* :  of Commander-in-Chief Balleray Zeluzny. Today we had a frank discussion about the changes needed
*09:50.060- 09:55.880* :  in the army. I propose that General Zeluzny continue to be part of the Ukrainian state team.
*09:56.380- 10:01.520* :  I would be grateful for his consent. Today I have decided to renew the leadership of the armed
*10:01.520- 10:09.520* :  forces of Ukraine. He'll be replaced by General Alexander Sursky, BBC Monashin's
*10:09.520- 10:14.620* :  Russia-Editor Vitaly Shevchenko, told me about the significance of this announcement.
*10:15.220- 10:23.460* :  It's very serious. He is the face of Ukraine's relatively successful counteroffensive of 2022,
*10:24.180- 10:30.860* :  almost universally revered by Ukrainians and respected by the Ukrainian military and the
*10:30.860- 10:36.380* :  discussion that I've seen after almost a year of near-stagnation on the front line,
*10:36.380- 10:42.380* :  the Ukrainian leadership is keen to reboot the military machine. So who is General Sursky?
*10:42.660- 10:50.140* :  General Sursky, he's been fighting in Donbass in eastern Ukraine for about 10 years. He was
*10:50.140- 10:57.120* :  appointed in charge of defending Kiev right at the start of the Russian invasion almost two years
*10:57.120- 11:04.960* :  ago. Then he must have minded Ukraine's surprisingly fast and effective counteroffensive in
*11:04.960- 11:10.980* :  northeast and Kharkiv region, defended Bachmoud. So President Zelensky's hope would be that he would
*11:10.980- 11:17.800* :  reinvigorate Ukraine's efforts to fight the Russians back. This was never going to be a popular
*11:17.800- 11:23.740* :  decision, frankly, and I've had a look at comments on President Zelensky's social media,
*11:24.060- 11:29.440* :  and the most popular comments are rude, and people say General Sursky should be the last
*11:29.440- 11:35.040* :  person to be sacked. I mean, this sends a fairly strong message to Russia, too, not necessarily a
*11:35.040- 11:40.760* :  message they want to send. Russia is definitely happy to see what's going on in Ukraine, and the
*11:40.760- 11:47.620* :  closest we came to getting an explanation of why exactly this is happening. It came from a
*11:47.620- 11:53.060* :  senior presidential advisor, Mikhail Podolak, who said, a new strategy needs to be developed.
*11:53.720- 12:00.420* :  New high-tech solutions need to be implemented. So it's not just about General Zelensky.
*12:01.260- 12:08.780* :  Vitaly Shevchenko. An international conservation organization space for giants has erected 500
*12:08.780- 12:15.600* :  electric fences in Gabon to deter elephants from trampling on crops. So far, nearly 5,000
*12:15.600- 12:20.940* :  subsistence farmers have benefited from the mobile fences, which also help protect the endangered
*12:20.940- 12:26.940* :  African forest elephant, our African regional editor Richard Hamilton, compiled this report.
*12:31.740- 12:37.900* :  The African forest elephant is the smaller of the continent's two species, just over two meters
*12:37.900- 12:44.780* :  tall, but it can cause huge destruction to crops and livelihoods. Villagers would often be
*12:44.780- 12:50.040* :  woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of the animals and then rush out to bang pots and
*12:50.040- 12:56.720* :  pans to try to scare them away. But now they can sleep soundly, as the fences have been proven to
*12:56.720- 13:04.160* :  be the most effective deterrent with a success rate of 95%. Erick Shehosky is the country director
*13:04.160- 13:10.980* :  for space for giants. He told me about the scale of the problem. Gabon is living very small villages,
*13:10.980- 13:15.900* :  generally less than 100 people in a village. The elephants are all over the country, this is a
*13:15.900- 13:21.920* :  national crisis. Most Gabon farmers planned for subsistence reasons. And elephants, they can have
*13:21.920- 13:26.340* :  this impact where you have a year's worth of work that's devastated in a single evening.
*13:26.780- 13:33.940* :  Gabon has around 95,000 forest elephants, the largest population of the species in the world.
*13:34.060- 13:41.020* :  Space for giants is working with the Ministry of Water and Forests to install more of these barriers.
*13:41.680- 13:46.660* :  They're not obtrusive, just a single electric wire about a meter above the ground,
*13:46.660- 13:53.400* :  attached to two posts or even trees, and they emit a non-fatal electric shock to the elephant.
*13:54.140- 13:59.640* :  They also protect the species because farmers don't need to kill the creatures to stop them
*13:59.640- 14:05.740* :  destroying their plants. Richard Hamilton. The director Martin Scorsese's latest film,
*14:05.740- 14:11.820* :  Killers of the Flower Moon, is based on a true story exploring the systematic murder of the
*14:11.820- 14:18.840* :  Oklahoma Osage Indians in the 1920s by white businessmen intent on swiping the native oil
*14:18.840- 14:23.660* :  rights for themselves. At the heart of the film is the love story between an Osage woman
*14:23.660- 14:30.260* :  played by Lily Gladstone and her white husband Leonardo DiCaprio. He is convinced to poison her
*14:30.260- 14:35.100* :  by his threatening uncle, played by Robert De Niro. The brains behind a series of murders
*14:35.100- 14:41.220* :  aimed at acquiring land and money from the wealthy Osage. Scorsese makes a cameo appearance
*14:41.220- 14:47.100* :  at the end with the poignant line. There was no mention of the murders. Amel Rajan asked him whether
*14:47.100- 14:54.480* :  the film was his attempt to write that historical wrong. I didn't think of it that way. I just
*14:54.480- 15:02.500* :  became immersed in the subject matter. Really what got me was that when the beer investigation
*15:02.720- 15:07.340* :  went into the Osage County, they went in and they tried to look for the perpetrators. They
*15:07.340- 15:12.420* :  basically said who did it? As it was reading the book and as Eric Rothen I worked on the script,
*15:12.420- 15:18.760* :  I began to realize who didn't do it. I became more fascinated with the complicity of everyone
*15:18.760- 15:25.100* :  involved, the community itself, the community hence the state hence the country. Telling the story
*15:25.100- 15:30.700* :  through the love story between Molly and Ernest out of that came the realization that this is
*15:30.700- 15:35.240* :  something that was completely covered. Nobody spoke about it. At first we were dealing with the
*15:35.240- 15:39.720* :  script from the Bureau of Investigations point of view. It feels much more of a love story now.
*15:39.900- 15:44.660* :  Well it became the love story because Margie Burcott got up and she spoke and she's the
*15:44.660- 15:50.780* :  granddaughter of Molly and Ernest and she pointed out that it's not simply perpetrator and victim.
*15:50.780- 15:55.520* :  He said Molly and Ernest were in love and when I heard that I said that might be the story
*15:55.780- 16:00.540* :  and that's eventually what Leo and I felt and he said let me play Ernest instead and so we went
*16:00.540- 16:06.020* :  from the love story out and as far as how I was affected by it I kind of lived with them,
*16:06.280- 16:12.200* :  I lived in another world, something that I would have perceived as a downtown New Yorker
*16:12.700- 16:17.960* :  as something extremely foreign that became really friends. Nobody began to know each other when
*16:17.960- 16:21.060* :  we all became friends we all worked together and made the film. You worked together for many,
*16:21.060- 16:25.160* :  many years with Robert De Niro, for many, many years with Leo DiCaprio but this is the first time
*16:25.160- 16:29.020* :  in 30 years that they've been together in the film. It was that a long held ambition to bring
*16:29.020- 16:33.640* :  those two together. That was always an ambition. It was not necessarily this film. It just turned out
*16:33.640- 16:39.840* :  that way. Also interestingly enough for me and for Bob and for Leo, the relationship reflects also
*16:39.840- 16:44.960* :  the mentor and the student, the father and the son. What makes Pope De Niro one of the greats?
*16:45.380- 16:52.160* :  For me he touches a tricky word but a truth about what it is to be a human being and the acceptance
*16:52.160- 16:57.680* :  of not only the good but also the bad, maybe even the evil, to the extent where you may
*16:57.740- 17:03.240* :  deplore his behavior as a character. You still feel for him? How is that?
*17:03.580- 17:05.600* :  Is there a bit of you in the characters that Bob De Niro has been?
*17:05.600- 17:11.760* :  I'm sure. I found that to deny it, it's a lie and so if there is an element of it, let's
*17:11.760- 17:15.000* :  explore it in myself if I can and it was lucky enough in these films.
*17:15.440- 17:20.020* :  For me in only a spirit of fairness, asking about Leo DiCaprio, what makes Leo DiCaprio one of
*17:20.020- 17:24.880* :  the greats? First of all, and this is from somebody studying the footage as we edit it myself in
*17:24.880- 17:31.000* :  Thelma, you could see this guy has a natural face for cinema. He doesn't have to do anything.
*17:31.000- 17:36.960* :  You could feel by frame by frame, looking at certain takes and choosing takes and you could see
*17:36.960- 17:40.980* :  his eyes move a certain way. He doesn't have to say anything. He's natural.
*17:42.300- 17:45.020* :  Martin Scorsese speaking to Amel Rajan.
*17:47.940- 17:54.120* :  Still to come in the global news podcast, the not quite so chic part of Paris that's
*17:54.120- 17:59.400* :  gearing up for the summer Olympics. People think there is more insecurity here because they are
*17:59.400- 18:03.500* :  more foreigners. Are you going to give a good welcome to the thousands of visitors who are going
*18:03.500- 18:09.260* :  to come here? Of course, don't you feel safe now? Inshallah, you'll be safe with us, brother.
*18:16.340- 18:21.160* :  Iraq says repeated US strikes against Iranian-backed militias on its soil,
*18:21.160- 18:26.140* :  threatening the region's stability. The Iraqi government says it might be forced to end the
*18:26.140- 18:31.400* :  presence of American troops in Iraq, who are helping to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic state
*18:31.400- 18:38.280* :  group. On Wednesday, a US drone attack in Baghdad killed a senior commander of a powerful pro-Iranian
*18:38.280- 18:44.340* :  group. Our senior international correspondent Al-Agerin attended his funeral in the city on Thursday
*18:44.340- 18:56.340* :  and sent this report. With chance of no no to America, mourners gathered in Baghdad to bury
*18:56.340- 19:02.860* :  the militia leader Abu Bakr Al-Sahadi. He was a commander of Katiob-Hazbullah,
*19:03.460- 19:11.560* :  blamed by the US for killing three of its troops in Jordan. Last night, America tracked him down
*19:11.660- 19:18.900* :  with a missile. As his coffin was carried shoulder high through the crowds, there were promises
*19:18.900- 19:28.500* :  of retaliation. Here is Faisal Al-Sahadi, Ashia cleric. This evil attack will be met with the
*19:28.500- 19:33.300* :  response from our brothers in the resistance. There is no negotiation with Americans,
*19:33.340- 19:40.920* :  and there is no solution, except to knock down their bases. Baghdad has angrily condemned the US
*19:40.920- 19:48.200* :  strike. It was a clear-cut assassination in a residential neighborhood, said a spokesman from
*19:48.200- 19:55.440* :  Ahamed Shia Al-Sudani, Iraq's prime minister. He said America was violating Iraqi sovereignty,
*19:55.580- 20:03.680* :  risking Iraqi lives, and increasing instability. That's a stunning indictment of an ally.
*20:04.640- 20:11.320* :  Every American attack fuels more anger here. The United Nations envoy in Iraq says the
*20:11.320- 20:17.760* :  country, like the wider Middle East, is on a knife edge. All Igarin in Baghdad.
*20:18.680- 20:23.840* :  Extreme weather events across the world are all too common, and in Mongolia a natural disaster
*20:23.840- 20:28.680* :  called Azud has caused a humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations.
*20:28.680- 20:34.460* :  Celia Hatton, Asia-Pacific editor, has been following the story, and began by telling me just
*20:34.460- 20:41.320* :  what Azud is. Azud is a weather event that's specific to Mongolia, and it's almost like a twin
*20:41.320- 20:47.160* :  set of disasters. A large percentage of the population of Mongolia, around 40% are hearders.
*20:47.380- 20:52.060* :  They move with their livestock throughout the year. They allow the livestock to graze on
*20:52.060- 20:58.020* :  Mongolia's abundant grasslands. The first part of the Azud takes place during the summer,
*20:58.440- 21:03.260* :  and that's when there's some kind of weather event. Heavy rain or drought that might affect
*21:03.260- 21:09.220* :  the grasslands to be able to grow in abundance during the summer, because that's when livestock
*21:09.220- 21:15.160* :  usually are allowed to feed and get fat. That's when hearders will gather hay, gather food,
*21:15.160- 21:20.440* :  to store away for the winter. Now this past summer, I should say, started off quite well,
*21:20.440- 21:25.880* :  but then there was a really cold snap, and there was a drought, and so a lot of the grass
*21:25.880- 21:31.240* :  died off, and so that means the cattle were quite weak to begin with, and the animals, goats,
*21:31.240- 21:37.700* :  horses, sheep, and then also the herders weren't able to gather food to put away for the winter.
*21:38.180- 21:43.140* :  Now the winter is the second part of the twin disaster. It's been a horrific winter. There's
*21:43.140- 21:50.320* :  been extreme cold, minus 40 degrees Celsius, very thick snow, and thick ice. Animals can't even get
*21:50.320- 21:55.560* :  through the ice to be able to graze on anything that might still be there, and because the livestock
*21:55.560- 21:59.960* :  are dying off, hurting families are not able to support themselves, so it's a real humanitarian
*21:59.960- 22:05.520* :  disaster. Why is this only happening in Mongolia? That's because Mongolia has a really specific
*22:05.520- 22:11.260* :  climate. It has the grasslands that I've mentioned, but because it's so close to Russia and Siberia,
*22:11.280- 22:17.020* :  it has Siberian winds that come down and push into the grassland, and so that's why it has
*22:17.020- 22:23.780* :  these beautiful summers, green grasslands, and then really harsh cold winters. Researchers say they
*22:23.780- 22:28.960* :  think the zoos now they're happening more and more often, and the grasslands simply aren't able to
*22:28.960- 22:34.180* :  recover, and that means the animals aren't able to recover. They're not having as many babies.
*22:34.180- 22:40.180* :  Lots of Mongolian herders are trying to save the babies, they're bringing them into their
*22:40.180- 22:44.440* :  yurts and cuddling them, trying to keep them warm, so they don't freeze to death the way that some
*22:44.440- 22:51.860* :  of the older bigger animals are. Celia Hatton. Paris is hosting the Olympic Games later this year,
*22:51.860- 22:57.480* :  but most of the action will be to the east of the city in Sen-Sandaniee, where the Olympic
*22:57.480- 23:01.940* :  village has been built, and where the National Stadium, the Stad de France, is situated.
*23:02.580- 23:09.360* :  Sen-Sandaniee is one of the highest immigrant origin populations in France, and is often associated
*23:09.360- 23:15.220* :  with urban problems, drugs, crimes, and riots in particular. But as John Lawrence reports,
*23:15.940- 23:20.760* :  this poor populist part of France is hoping the Olympics will turn its reputation around.
*23:22.800- 23:28.800* :  Emerging from the metro in Sen-Sandaniee is not very reassuring, mainly because of the number of
*23:28.800- 23:34.300* :  guys hanging around who really don't look like they're waiting for their girlfriends. But more
*23:34.300- 23:39.420* :  than a bit of the unease is due to what me and most of the other 68 million people who live in
*23:39.420- 23:46.180* :  France carry around in our heads about the Bonnu or suburbs in general, and this one in particular,
*23:46.180- 23:52.700* :  possibly involving images of burning cars and crack dealers in hoodies. So much so that the idea
*23:52.700- 23:58.180* :  of an agency for the development of tourism in Sen-Sandaniee would strike many as some sort of joke,
*23:59.000- 24:06.120* :  and yet it exists, and its director Olivier Mayer is waiting for me just a couple of hundred meters
*24:06.120- 24:13.000* :  away. The Sen-Sandaniee Cathedral Basilica is one of the first Gothic cathedrals and the remains
*24:13.000- 24:18.840* :  of the kings and queens of France are here. The visitor. Last year we had a hundred thousand visitors.
*24:19.440- 24:24.580* :  That's nothing compared to the over 12 million a year who visited Notre-Dame de Paris before the
*24:24.580- 24:30.120* :  fire. Here we have a few minutes by metro from Paris, 10 minutes by foot from the Stade de France,
*24:30.140- 24:36.540* :  15 minutes from the Olympic village. So we hope that at last the cathedral Basilica will start to get
*24:36.540- 24:42.780* :  the number of visitors it deserves. One of the main reasons few visitors come now, he says,
*24:43.260- 24:48.920* :  is Sen-Sandaniee's image, but in fact the last available figures show crime rates are as high
*24:48.920- 24:55.780* :  in the central Paris as they are here. At the local market most people say the reality is not so bad
*24:55.780- 25:02.240* :  and they hope to prove it during the Olympics. People shouldn't worry, since on knees like everywhere
*25:02.240- 25:08.320* :  else in France, there is good and bad. I've been living here since 1958 and nobody has ever
*25:08.320- 25:13.720* :  shown me a lack of respect. Whenever I tell a colleague that I live in Sen-Sandaniee,
*25:13.720- 25:19.220* :  the way they say me changes. Sometimes when I find a girlfriend on Tinder, as soon as I say I live
*25:19.220- 25:23.900* :  in Sen-Sandaniee, she blocks me. So are they right these people or are they wrong?
*25:24.180- 25:29.780* :  For me, they are a bit right because there is a lot of violence here.
*25:29.780- 25:35.540* :  There are a lot of violence here. There is more insecurity here because there are more foreigners,
*25:35.540- 25:39.940* :  but it's the same everywhere. On the contrary, we foreigners are very welcoming.
*25:39.940- 25:44.280* :  Are you going to give a good welcome to the thousands of visitors who are going to come here?
*25:44.480- 25:51.580* :  Will, of course. Don't you feel safe now? A very warm welcome to you. In Shallah, you'll be safe with us, brother.
*25:54.620- 25:59.980* :  Opinion Poles say Parisians are a bit iffy about the Olympics. Paris is expecting a record
*25:59.980- 26:06.560* :  15 to 16 million visitors this summer. The transport system is already critically overcrowded so
*26:06.560- 26:13.380* :  people are legitimately concerned about overload. But those polls show a big difference in Sen-Sandaniee
*26:13.380- 26:19.600* :  where 80% of people are enthusiastic. It's partly about money. A French Parliamentary report concluded
*26:19.600- 26:25.500* :  the games will bring between 5 and 10 billion euros of revenue, one major subject of cafe
*26:25.500- 26:30.540* :  conversation at the moment is who's going to try to make a fast euro by renting out a room for the
*26:30.540- 26:37.880* :  Olympics with Airbnb quoting prices 4, 5, 6 times higher than usual. John Lawrenceon.
*26:38.800- 26:43.860* :  In a recent edition of the Global News Podcast, we told you about a wonderful photo that's just
*26:43.860- 26:50.360* :  one apprise. It's of a young polar bear asleep on a small iceberg drifting off the Norwegian's
*26:50.360- 26:56.480* :  Falbad archipelago. The image won the People's Choice Award in the Wildlife Photographer of the
*26:56.480- 27:02.560* :  Year competition run by Britain's Natural History Museum. It was taken by Nemi Sarikhani while
*27:02.560- 27:08.020* :  on a two week trip with seven other photographers during the Covid pandemic and in difficult conditions.
*27:08.020- 27:13.620* :  He spoke to Tim Franks. The first three days was just incredibly foggy to barely see the
*27:13.620- 27:19.500* :  abstract hand. But luckily, after three days, the skies cleared up in the drift ice we came across.
*27:19.560- 27:24.880* :  This lovely bear. It's a young bear. It looks enormously comfy on its
*27:24.880- 27:32.200* :  bed of ice. It's at an angle of about 45 degrees. Am I right in saying the witness? It's scooping
*27:32.200- 27:38.240* :  out a sort of hollow in order to make it's bed on the iceberg a bit more comfy. That's correct.
*27:38.560- 27:42.860* :  And you're right, it was a young bear. At one point, an older male came and tried to chase him off
*27:42.900- 27:46.680* :  but then the old bear lost interest and the young bear stayed around us, which was just magical.
*27:46.980- 27:51.460* :  After about three, four hours of observing from the icebreaker, they lowered a couple of
*27:51.460- 27:56.900* :  zodiacs, rubber, motorized boats down and we climbed on them and then spent another four hours with him.
*27:56.900- 28:01.120* :  So he was just swimming through the pack ice, which is where they hunt for seals most of the
*28:01.200- 28:05.260* :  that photo was taken shortly before midnight. So obviously, we got a bit naked, wanted a nap,
*28:05.260- 28:09.980* :  climbed aboard the small iceberg. He did claw out the shelf and had a short nap.
*28:09.980- 28:16.560* :  It looks blissful in its own savage way. I mean, because it is a savage landscape, but I
*28:16.560- 28:22.300* :  wonder how far you think it fits into our concern about the changing climate. But you know,
*28:22.300- 28:27.340* :  the polar bear seemed particularly exposed. Can we read anything into that from your image?
*28:27.540- 28:32.700* :  I believe so. This was my second trip. The previous one was 12, 13 years ago. There was a
*28:32.700- 28:37.740* :  far less ice this time than there was previously. And they acquired the drift ice to hunt predominantly
*28:37.740- 28:42.020* :  for the main source of food, which is seals. Their strong swimmer's and they can travel past
*28:42.020- 28:46.480* :  distances, but you don't want to place extra stress on them. They're also fairly adaptable,
*28:46.880- 28:52.320* :  as I observed last year, actually, a couple of failed polar bear hunting reindeer. But this is not
*28:52.320- 28:56.280* :  their natural food. They don't have the same amount of blood, which is what they could only sustain
*28:56.280- 29:01.040* :  themselves on. And they can overheat quite quickly while running on land. I think it does demonstrate
*29:01.040- 29:07.480* :  the perils they face. When you took this one image, did you know at the time that you had something
*29:07.480- 29:13.020* :  really special? Coming across the bear is elation. You get so excited on the day and there's so many
*29:13.020- 29:18.000* :  photos taken to many thousands of images. And you always think you have one or two special ones,
*29:18.120- 29:22.620* :  but I always like to sort of wait a few weeks and then revisit everything because a motion can
*29:22.620- 29:27.340* :  cloud which ones you really like. At that time, I thought it was unique. I hadn't ever seen a
*29:27.340- 29:31.000* :  photo like that before, but it was just one of several. There was only one I went back and I
*29:31.000- 29:34.440* :  realized what special moment it was. That was the one that really captured my heart.
*29:34.640- 29:42.080* :  Photographer Nimi Saracani talking to Tim Franks. Now to a comeback that's been decades in the making.
*29:54.180- 30:00.860* :  The song, Fast Car Game D, you are seeing a Tracy Chapman legions of new fans after her performance
*30:01.780- 30:07.240* :  with the country singer Luke Combs, Sunday's Grammy Awards. Her last appearance there was back in
*30:07.240- 30:14.400* :  1988 when she just released Fast Car and one best new artist for songs like Talking About a Revolution
*30:14.400- 30:21.080* :  and Baby Can I Hold You. For a musician, Chapman has remained largely absent from the music world.
*30:21.080- 30:26.820* :  Maybe that's why her appearance was described as a big highlight of the Grammys by many music critics.
*30:26.820- 30:32.980* :  Among them, Chris Woman from Variety, who's back to Delina Gupta. Tracy Chapman has been
*30:32.980- 30:39.400* :  pretty much invisible for the last 15 years, except for three television appearances. Otherwise,
*30:39.400- 30:45.060* :  no one's purchased from her since 2009. No albums, no concerts, no tours. Apparently living very
*30:45.060- 30:50.140* :  happily off the grid, people have talked about sightings of her in San Francisco at pet food stores.
*30:50.580- 30:55.160* :  But I don't think people realize she was missing for a long time until this country hit
*30:55.160- 31:00.760* :  came up with this cover of Fast Car by Luke Combs. It seems pretty counterintuitive to the celebrity
*31:00.760- 31:06.520* :  culture one is used to. Just last night, and I must admit, it was the first time I was listening
*31:06.520- 31:13.480* :  to the song. I've grown up in India for many people like me. Just tell us what makes Tracy Chapman,
*31:13.480- 31:19.080* :  Tracy Chapman. You know, she was always an anomaly. Even at her peak the days when she was the
*31:19.080- 31:25.420* :  biggest star. She was very reserved. She would say that she was shy. And for some reason, despite
*31:25.420- 31:31.280* :  basically being a folk singer who was not super emotionally expressive or anything as a performer,
*31:31.280- 31:36.320* :  she just drew people in. And it was largely the power of the songwriting. And in the case of Fast
*31:36.320- 31:41.200* :  Car, I'm going to get some credit to that guitar lick too. But it's also the art of the storytelling.
*31:41.200- 31:46.720* :  It's a narrative about people who have lost their dreams. They've had some economic distress.
*31:47.220- 31:51.440* :  People relate to it, even though they don't necessarily think of it as depressing a song as
*31:51.480- 31:57.020* :  you could read it. It's one of those songs where everyone who was alive in around the 1980s
*31:57.140- 32:02.260* :  immediately goes back to where they were in 1988 and maybe they heard it on live aid. But kids
*32:02.260- 32:07.560* :  love it too, which is fascinating to me as that's something I would not have guessed, but it has
*32:07.560- 32:12.520* :  that power across generations. And timeless as well. But for Tracy Chapman to get that kind of
*32:12.520- 32:18.960* :  success at the age of 24, do you think it was too much pressure for her? She indicated that she
*32:18.960- 32:24.800* :  didn't deal well with the pressure. She hasn't done interviews to say what caused her to get out
*32:24.800- 32:30.380* :  of the business. Her last album was in 2008. It peaked at number 57. So she wasn't having hits
*32:30.380- 32:35.420* :  at the time. And maybe she just thought, I don't enjoy doing this. I'm not inherently someone who
*32:35.420- 32:41.280* :  enjoys being out on stage who likes doing interviews. So why do I need to bother anymore? And sometimes
*32:41.340- 32:47.200* :  people who are recluses, we've become even more fascinated with them. It's funny that Tracy Chapman
*32:47.200- 32:51.700* :  and Taylor Swift talk about two opposites. I mean, Taylor Swift is endlessly feeding her
*32:51.700- 32:56.640* :  audience with new product and constant information. Tracy has literally not been feeding her audience
*32:56.640- 33:02.260* :  anything for the last 15 years. And yet right now they're equally transfixing to a massive
*33:02.260- 33:07.260* :  audience. It's almost hilariously ironic. Do you feel that there could be something that her fans
*33:07.820- 33:12.060* :  haven't heard? Absence has really made the heart graphometer. And right now I think she could fill
*33:12.060- 33:16.560* :  arenas. The world could be her oyster right now if she wanted it. It seems like she doesn't want it.
*33:16.640- 33:23.600* :  Before we let you go Chris, do you drive a fast car? No, I have a Honda. I had a turbocharged car once
*33:23.600- 33:26.680* :  upon a time. Those were nostalgic days, just like in the song.
*33:41.560- 33:48.220* :  Chris Wilman on the enduring popularity of Tracy Chapman, whose single fast car rose to the top
*33:48.220- 33:52.480* :  of the iTunes charts after her performance at the Grammneys on Sunday.
*33:55.800- 34:01.040* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast.
*34:01.040- 34:06.880* :  Later, this edition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*34:07.400- 34:11.900* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritzon and until next time, goodbye.
*34:21.980- 34:26.180* :  I'm Katya Adler from the Global Story podcast, and we're talking about the world's
*34:26.180- 34:33.000* :  biggest pop star Taylor Swift, a musical and economic powerhouse. But could she really swing
*34:33.000- 34:38.960* :  the US presidential election? It's a matter of furious debate in Republican circles. Are they
*34:38.960- 34:43.820* :  onto something? The Global Story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC
