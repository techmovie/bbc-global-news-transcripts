*01:07.780- 01:11.960* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:12.940- 01:18.900* :  And Valerie Sanderson and at 1400R's GMT on Friday the 23rd of February, these are our main stories.
*01:19.480- 01:22.140* :  New Western sanctions are to be imposed on Russia.
*01:22.720- 01:27.520* :  Firefighters in the Spanish city of Valencia are trying to access an apartment block
*01:27.520- 01:31.020* :  gutted by fire to search for people who are still missing.
*01:31.620- 01:36.280* :  We get the details on proposals for the governance of Gaza after the complete ends.
*01:38.960- 01:44.760* :  Also in this podcast, in Kenya, the funeral for the marathon world record holder Kelvin Keptum
*01:44.760- 01:51.240* :  has been taking place. Plus, two years on from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we ask a man who
*01:51.240- 01:55.520* :  fought from the beginning if Ukraine can still win the war.
*01:56.260- 02:01.840* :  Yes, of course, I hope, but I assume it's war will be long.
*02:02.520- 02:07.800* :  And for Olyeg today, a wheelchair, medals and retirement.
*02:12.240- 02:17.320* :  Ever since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine two years ago, the West has been waging
*02:17.320- 02:21.980* :  an economic conflict on Russia. Now, they're tightening the screw.
*02:22.500- 02:27.680* :  The US and EU have both announced a new round of sanctions, a week after the death in custody
*02:27.680- 02:32.860* :  of the Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. Are you ready? Danny Eberhardt told us more.
*02:33.520- 02:39.460* :  The US is introducing 500 new sanctions. President Biden said that they're there to ensure that
*02:39.460- 02:45.060* :  President Putin pays an even steeper price as he put it for his aggression abroad and his
*02:45.060- 02:50.780* :  repression at home. So it's partly linked to the ongoing war of conquests as the US calls it
*02:50.780- 02:57.780* :  in Ukraine, but also the recent death in Russian custody of Alexey Navalny, the main critic of
*02:57.780- 03:04.640* :  President Putin. And what they do, basically, they try to target things like Russia's defense
*03:04.640- 03:13.540* :  industry, its financial sector, and people involved in repression. And the EU, basically,
*03:13.540- 03:20.400* :  is following with similar things. So the EU is listing 200 new entities. That's individuals
*03:20.400- 03:27.640* :  and companies. And that brings to 2000 the number of people, the number of the entities that the
*03:27.640- 03:33.040* :  EU has listed, which is a similar figure to Britain. Britain introduced new sanctions on Thursday.
*03:33.040- 03:40.640* :  So it's a coordinated campaign this, designed to restrict revenues and cut off Russia's war
*03:41.100- 03:44.780* :  machine. But Russia has managed to get around sanctions before, hasn't it?
*03:45.120- 03:50.480* :  It certainly has. And the big game here is how well it does it this time round.
*03:51.080- 03:58.940* :  It's basically a game of cat and mouse or whack a mole. So as soon as the EU brings in sanctions
*03:58.940- 04:05.440* :  or the US, Western Allies, then Russia tries to evade it. They set up networks to create parallel
*04:05.440- 04:11.660* :  imports of goods through countries such as former Soviet, neighboring former Soviet countries,
*04:11.660- 04:19.200* :  states like Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, of course. And sometimes
*04:19.200- 04:23.980* :  what happens is that individuals doing this, sometimes it's with the connivance of the authorities
*04:24.440- 04:29.480* :  or the authorities at least turn a blind eye. So it's very difficult to prosecute. There are some
*04:29.480- 04:35.840* :  prosecutions, both of companies abroad and companies within, for example, the EU or the US,
*04:35.840- 04:41.940* :  but they're rare and how effective it is, it's not quite clear. So Russia at the moment will still
*04:41.940- 04:45.160* :  try to evade these things as fast as they're put in place.
*04:46.180- 04:51.140* :  Daniel Bajard and will have more from Ukraine later in this edition of the podcast.
*04:52.300- 04:56.800* :  A massive fire that's ripped through two apartment blocks in the Spanish time of Valencia
*04:56.800- 05:02.400* :  has now been extinguished, but at least four people are known to have died and it's fear that
*05:02.400- 05:08.080* :  number will rise up to 15 others are still missing. Although the building is still very hot,
*05:08.460- 05:13.380* :  firefighters have been able to enter the lower floors and to begin searching for missing people.
*05:14.080- 05:18.380* :  There have been suggestions that the material covering the building was highly inflammable.
*05:18.840- 05:21.020* :  Paco Pollott is a journalist in the city.
*05:21.860- 05:28.500* :  This is officially the worst fire suffered in the city of Valencia. I would say ever,
*05:28.720- 05:35.460* :  you know, the way just happened, the way the fire kick started, it expanded and suddenly
*05:35.460- 05:42.220* :  engulfed the whole building. Many questions are being aroused in the last few hours regarding
*05:42.220- 05:50.060* :  the security of the construction materials, the whole polyethylene being used in the facade.
*05:50.060- 05:55.040* :  You know, many questions are like said, but yeah, definitely the whole city is in shock at this
*05:55.040- 06:01.500* :  moment. Valencia has declared three days of official mourning. Vincent Maccavini has this report.
*06:03.920- 06:10.140* :  Firefighters in Valencia were first alerted at around 5.30 yesterday afternoon after a blaze broke
*06:10.140- 06:17.840* :  out on one of the building's lower floors. It quickly spread with eyewitnesses saying it engulfed
*06:17.840- 06:24.320* :  the entire 14-story structure in a matter of minutes. Residents fled to their balconies
*06:24.720- 06:31.420* :  with firefighters making dramatic rescues. Others waited in the smoke for their turn.
*06:33.020- 06:38.720* :  It's dogande. It's shocking. I don't know what to make of it. It's sad, very sad.
*06:40.540- 06:45.060* :  I told my daughter and mother-in-law to leave other people stayed inside.
*06:47.100- 06:52.540* :  The residential block in Valencia's Campanar neighborhood contains 138 flats,
*06:52.540- 07:00.560* :  thought to be home to around 450 residents. More than 25 crews continued to tackle the blaze
*07:00.560- 07:05.980* :  through the night as strong winds fan the flames, helping them to spread to an adjoining building.
*07:07.180- 07:12.300* :  There are fears for those who may have been trapped inside, a makeshift hospital was set up
*07:12.300- 07:18.460* :  nearby to treat the injured. Local authorities have set up a helpline to assist those searching
*07:18.460- 07:23.960* :  for loved ones who lived in the apartments. One expert who previously inspected the building
*07:23.960- 07:28.960* :  has told the Spanish press, the block's exterior featured a polyurethane material,
*07:29.600- 07:33.080* :  which is no longer in wide use because of fears over flammability.
*07:34.460- 07:39.500* :  With the speed of the fires spread, questions are now being asked in Spain not just about how
*07:39.500- 07:44.460* :  this fire started, but about how quickly the materials used in the building's construction
*07:44.460- 07:52.500* :  allowed it to take hold. Vincent Macavini, a report by the UN Human Rights Office has laid bare
*07:52.500- 07:58.840* :  horrific violations being committed by both sides in Sudan. The report covers the first eight
*07:58.840- 08:05.200* :  months of the war there. Here's image in folks. The UN report details the most atrocious violations.
*08:05.500- 08:12.500* :  This weak video emerged in which students were beheaded by men in uniform. They were later seen
*08:12.500- 08:19.580* :  parading the decapitated heads through the streets, chanting ethnic slurs. The report also details
*08:19.580- 08:26.640* :  rape, including of children, but says the stigma around sexual violence means few victims will
*08:26.640- 08:34.100* :  report it. Satellite imagery shows widespread use of heavy explosives on densely populated areas,
*08:34.100- 08:40.880* :  killing large numbers of civilians, and in Darfur the report suggests thousands have died
*08:40.880- 08:48.540* :  in ethnically motivated attacks. Image in folks. Saturday marks two years since Russia's invasion of
*08:48.540- 08:54.800* :  Ukraine, which has led to tens of thousands of deaths and drawn in other countries. The BBC's Andrew
*08:54.800- 09:00.400* :  Harding has reported on the war throughout, but in this report from the front lines of Eastern Ukraine,
*09:00.400- 09:06.980* :  he assesses the impact of the conflict through the eyes and experience of one Ukrainian fighter.
*09:11.220- 09:17.420* :  It was April 2022 in a besieged Ukrainian town called Lisi Chance, that we first ran into
*09:17.420- 09:25.000* :  Oleg Kravchenko. It was placed at a location point. Oleg, a burly, cheerful 48-year-old surgeon,
*09:25.100- 09:32.420* :  had just joined Ukraine's army as a volunteer medic. He offered to drive us to a field hospital,
*09:32.740- 09:39.460* :  casualties arriving from the nearby front lines. Yes, every day it's a blood, blood, blood, blood.
*09:39.840- 09:45.480* :  In those early days, Oleg was full of hope of confidence. It's my country. The Russians are pushing
*09:46.280- 09:53.920* :  now, bombing a lot. I thought it may be one and a half months, and we will suit every
*09:55.040- 10:00.640* :  Russia. You'll push them out. Yes. So you think you're winning this? Yes, yes.
*10:01.280- 10:06.740* :  But within weeks, the Russians had destroyed and captured Lisi Chancek. They still hold it.
*10:10.640- 10:12.800* :  It will be a year before we met Oleg again.
*10:21.720- 10:27.020* :  His medical team from Ukraine's 57th Brigade was now working in another front line town,
*10:27.020- 10:33.800* :  Bucknut. Lots of new casualties from Ukraine's struggling counteroffensive,
*10:33.800- 10:38.460* :  Oleg looked exhausted. I'm still alive. You're still alive, yes.
*10:38.480- 10:45.820* :  I've been alive, yes. But it's been a difficult year. Where a difficult? As if to prove the point,
*10:45.820- 10:55.340* :  incoming fire forced us to dive for cover. You're not worried about your safety.
*10:56.240- 11:02.080* :  My fate is... I don't know.
*11:06.720- 11:11.680* :  And now, two years into the war, we've come to meet Oleg's team once again.
*11:17.800- 11:21.660* :  As usual, they're in the thick of it. This time in Kupiansk,
*11:23.160- 11:29.280* :  Ukrainian artillery firing at nearby Russian positions. But the Kremlin's forces are starting to
*11:29.280- 11:41.560* :  inch forwards here, as elsewhere. But what of Oleg? We'd lost touch with him for several months,
*11:41.660- 11:45.060* :  but now heard news of an attack last October.
*11:49.100- 11:54.880* :  This video shows the burning ruins of the Brigade's field hospital. It had been hit one night
*11:54.880- 12:00.160* :  by a Russian rocket. Three medics were killed. My friend died.
*12:00.880- 12:05.200* :  Oleg was badly injured, but survived. His leg mangled.
*12:06.480- 12:13.300* :  It's difficult. Difficult for me, and my mind is changed after that.
*12:13.820- 12:17.940* :  When we first met in Lissitchansk, you were hopeful that Ukraine could win.
*12:18.240- 12:24.660* :  When we met in Bakmut, you were tired and worried. Very tired.
*12:25.420- 12:30.040* :  Now, how do you feel about the war? Can Ukraine win?
*12:30.980- 12:37.140* :  Yes, of course. I hope, but I think it's work will be long.
*12:37.880- 12:43.260* :  A long war then. And for Oleg today, a wheelchair, medals.
*12:47.720- 12:53.160* :  And retirement. After two years, that have transformed every life in this country.
*12:54.240- 13:00.180* :  Andrew Harding. Hundreds of mourners have gathered at the funeral for the marathon world record holder
*13:00.180- 13:05.580* :  Kelvin Kiptum, which has been taking place in his village in Western Kenya. The 24-year-old
*13:05.580- 13:10.220* :  died in a car crash two weeks ago. The president of World Athletics of Asteynkoz
*13:10.220- 13:14.340* :  said he believed Kiptum would have become the first man to break the two-hour barrier
*13:14.680- 13:17.380* :  in an official marathon race. And he paid the tribute.
*13:18.180- 13:20.560* :  How do I remember him? I remember him as a happy,
*13:21.920- 13:33.820* :  contented, focused, dedicated, and humble man. It's a huge loss to the sport, but I think on this
*13:33.820- 13:41.520* :  occasion, it would be remiss of me not to reflect on the grievous loss that he is to a family,
*13:42.820- 13:48.840* :  to parents, to a wife, to children. Kelvin Kiptum's wife wept during her tribute.
*13:49.400- 13:54.940* :  I asked the BBC's Celestine Corroning, who's at the burial site, to tell us about the day so far.
*13:55.840- 14:03.000* :  It's been quite a sad day here. We've had the funeral of Kelvin Kiptum. Athletes were at his
*14:03.000- 14:07.300* :  house early morning. They have been walking with him. The final journey to his resting place.
*14:07.300- 14:13.240* :  Now, it's been quite a somber atmosphere. Hundreds have come to bid farewell to a man who was
*14:13.240- 14:17.540* :  really, really loved by his community. Political leaders have come led by the president,
*14:17.540- 14:22.680* :  as well as other leaders within the sport. Sebastian Kowal, the Athletics President, is here.
*14:23.200- 14:28.100* :  And Valerie, it's been the kind of there where people are really speaking in harsh tones.
*14:28.840- 14:33.000* :  Some people have spoken to speak to me and then they put their head down and they look
*14:33.000- 14:38.000* :  away when they walk away. They can't even finish sentences. So it speaks to the deep emotions that
*14:38.360- 14:43.740* :  are really running high here. And of course, this is being held in his village in Kenya, isn't it?
*14:44.200- 14:49.900* :  Yes, it is being held in Chapsamu village. This is where he grew up. This is where he went to school.
*14:49.900- 14:55.060* :  So a lot of people here are mourning someone. They really knew and were connected to
*14:56.080- 15:00.380* :  more than just the athletes. Here, he was more than an athlete, Valerie. He was a brother,
*15:00.380- 15:05.040* :  he was a friend, a schoolmate. But there are people who have come from other areas from neighboring
*15:05.040- 15:11.200* :  counties. This whole region usually has a lot of athletics community. So people have come from
*15:11.520- 15:17.500* :  up to 400 kilometers away to come in Moana, Calvin, Keptum, here in Chapsamu village.
*15:18.220- 15:23.840* :  And when did people there see him last? You see, Valerie, most of the athletes usually leave
*15:24.280- 15:30.000* :  in their home locale. So a lot of people who come from the area, especially where exactly where
*15:30.000- 15:34.200* :  the funeral is happening. And you know, just a few kilometers down the road from where he actually
*15:34.200- 15:39.560* :  lives. Most of them see him every day. In fact, I had someone tell me in the morning, after
*15:39.560- 15:44.360* :  when he went running, he passed by the shop and took some tomatoes to go and make food for later.
*15:44.820- 15:48.580* :  So a lot of people have seen him during the day. They had talked to him on the fateful
*15:48.640- 15:53.660* :  Sunday that he passed on. So a lot of people here are remembering their last moments
*15:54.680- 15:59.040* :  with two-month athletes telling me, he met him and you know, and gave him some money and said,
*15:59.040- 16:03.200* :  you know, have lunch today. You know, so these are the stories we are hearing here today, Valerie.
*16:03.580- 16:07.420* :  And of course, we should remember he was only 24 when he died in a car crash.
*16:09.340- 16:14.880* :  Oh yeah, he was, he was very young. He was not just a young athlete, a young talented athlete,
*16:14.880- 16:20.960* :  but he also had a young family. At 24, he had a wife with two children. He's eldest is seven
*16:20.960- 16:27.040* :  and he's youngest is four. He was an only child in his home. His mother was telling us that she
*16:27.040- 16:30.680* :  couldn't conceive after she gave birth to keep two benches. So she decided, you know, we're just
*16:30.680- 16:35.240* :  going to have one child. And so she was telling us, you know, how much despair she felt. She lost
*16:35.240- 16:40.880* :  hope when her son passed on because she said, this is my only child, what am I going to do now?
*16:40.880- 16:46.980* :  But she spoke to about how her grandchildren are now giving her strength to move forward. She said,
*16:46.980- 16:51.080* :  I now need to leave her for my grandchildren. Take care of them. They were, I would have taken care
*16:51.080- 16:58.600* :  of it too. Celestine Caroni in Kenya. The United States has returned to the moon this time though,
*16:58.600- 17:04.560* :  more than 50 years later, it's a private company that's touched down. Built by intuitive machines,
*17:04.560- 17:09.780* :  the craft landed in the South Pole region and the success of the mission marks a new direction
*17:09.780- 17:14.180* :  for moon exploration. But while it may have been a private company behind the initiative,
*17:14.180- 17:20.640* :  there were many actors involved, not least NASA and its chief Bill Nelson stressed the collaborative
*17:20.640- 17:29.000* :  nature of the mission. Today is a day that shows the power and promise of NASA's commercial partnerships.
*17:30.480- 17:35.900* :  Congratulations to everyone involved in this great and daring quest at intuitive machines,
*17:36.140- 17:44.480* :  SpaceX and right here at NASA. What a triumph. Odysseus has taken the moon.
*17:45.840- 17:50.860* :  This feat is a giant leap forward for all of humanity.
*17:51.780- 17:55.360* :  Last minute glitches meant the touchdown was even more satisfying.
*17:55.500- 18:00.340* :  Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos was watching as the first signals from the moon
*18:00.340- 18:05.560* :  reached mission control in Houston. We can confirm without a doubt
*18:06.340- 18:09.180* :  as our equipment is on the surface of the moon and we are transmitting.
*18:10.100- 18:13.400* :  It was a big moment for the commercial exploitation of space.
*18:13.920- 18:18.500* :  More than standing effort, I know this was a nail-biter and welcome to the moon.
*18:18.800- 18:22.080* :  It was a big moment too for the American space program in general.
*18:22.640- 18:27.660* :  Intuitive machines has broken the United States half-century absence from the moon's surface.
*18:28.340- 18:34.300* :  Odysseus is just a robot but its planned scientific investigations make it a scout for the return
*18:34.300- 18:40.060* :  of astronauts to the moon later this decade. The South Pole landing location has waterized in
*18:40.060- 18:45.860* :  shadowed craters that can be used by future explorers, says NASA's Director of Planetary Science
*18:45.860- 18:50.620* :  Laurie Glaze. We could use that ice to convert it to water, drinkable drinking water.
*18:50.620- 18:56.860* :  We can extract oxygen and hydrogen for fuel and for breathing for the astronauts so it really
*18:56.860- 19:02.780* :  helps us in human exploration. The hope is intuitive machine success will mark the start of a new
*19:02.780- 19:08.480* :  lunar economy in which many private companies make money buying and selling services at the moon

*21:29.640- 21:34.740* :  Reports were merged in the Israeli media about proposed administrative arrangements in Gaza
*21:34.740- 21:40.420* :  after this conflict ends. According to the Times of Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*21:40.420- 21:45.760* :  has presented the plan, which includes installing new Palestinian politicians to oversee the
*21:45.760- 21:51.700* :  strip to his security cabinet. I asked our correspondent Jenny Hill in Jerusalem to tell us more
*21:51.700- 21:56.880* :  about the government's plans. It looks as though what Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do is
*21:56.880- 22:02.600* :  install what is described as local officials to effectively administer the strip.
*22:02.780- 22:08.140* :  These are people who don't have any affiliation to, well, the Israelis would refer to as terrorist
*22:08.980- 22:12.740* :  organizations. So I'm reading broadly anyone who doesn't have an affiliation to, to Hamas, for
*22:12.740- 22:17.820* :  example, difficult to say at this stage, would they object to people who had affiliations to the
*22:17.880- 22:22.400* :  Palestinian Authority? Hard to say. At the moment, we just hear local civilians.
*22:23.060- 22:28.440* :  The strip would be demilitarized and Israel would, under the plan, retain operational freedom
*22:28.440- 22:35.700* :  of activity within Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has also vowed to shut down UNRA. That's the UN
*22:35.700- 22:41.980* :  agency, which looks after Palestinian refugees, which Israel has accused of complicity or
*22:41.980- 22:47.900* :  accuse some of its workers of complicity with the October 7th Hamas attacks. UNRA has fired
*22:47.900- 22:54.620* :  around 10 of its staff and launched an investigation into that. And this comes, doesn't it, as
*22:54.640- 23:01.000* :  and is really negotiating team heads to Paris to join truce talks there? What do we know about that?
*23:01.440- 23:05.700* :  Yeah, we know that these negotiations are aimed at brokering a temporary ceasefire and the
*23:05.700- 23:11.720* :  release of those Israeli hostages. And Israeli delegation has, we're told, been sent to the
*23:11.760- 23:17.800* :  talks. That in itself suggests that there might be something to talk about. Israel until very recently
*23:18.420- 23:22.320* :  was pretty damning about its position within these negotiations. And in particular,
*23:22.320- 23:27.200* :  Hamas's position, it described that as delusional Benjamin Netanyahu saying that, you know,
*23:27.200- 23:32.760* :  as recently as the weekend, we have in the last couple of days heard a note of extremely
*23:32.760- 23:38.700* :  cautious optimism from one minister from the War Cabinet, Benny Gantz, who said that the
*23:38.700- 23:45.020* :  preliminary signs were that there was a possibility of progress towards a deal. Hamas officials
*23:45.020- 23:51.220* :  were meeting Egyptian officials in Cairo in the last couple of days and the states have sent
*23:51.220- 23:57.040* :  their senior Middle East envoy to the region. He was first of all in Egypt, then in Israel,
*23:57.040- 24:02.920* :  holding talks with Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. So the talks will continue today. In Paris,
*24:03.260- 24:06.720* :  the Qataris are there, the Egyptians are there, both of them, of course, driving forces in these
*24:06.720- 24:10.840* :  talks. But you know, they're under some pressure and the US very keen to get some kind of deal
*24:10.840- 24:16.360* :  struck before the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is March 10th. And that's
*24:16.360- 24:21.960* :  an important deadline because that, of course, is when Israel insists if the hostages aren't returned.
*24:22.060- 24:27.480* :  It will begin its major ground offensive in the southern city of Raffa, which is currently home
*24:27.480- 24:33.820* :  to well over a million displaced Palestinian civilians. Jenny Hill. Well, all this comes as a
*24:33.820- 24:39.660* :  senior United Nations official has been telling the BBC about the squalid conditions in Gaza itself.
*24:40.380- 24:44.620* :  The UN humanitarian coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick, has just returned from Gaza,
*24:45.040- 24:47.920* :  and told our correspondent, Paul Adams, about the situation there.
*24:48.880- 24:52.560* :  It's so overcrowded. You go there, the squalid conditions that people find themselves living.
*24:52.560- 24:56.560* :  And, you know, the water and sanitation problems that people have, getting clean water,
*24:57.160- 25:01.780* :  you know, and then kids who are just milling around to have good nothing to do, really struggling
*25:01.780- 25:06.580* :  to survive. And you can just see them that they're quite, quite mistreated in terms of, and quite
*25:06.580- 25:11.580* :  drawn and quite pale. And that's a result of poor nutrition. And then when you see this statistics
*25:11.580- 25:16.280* :  in terms of the unhealthiness of the way kids have lived there, the hepatitis A,
*25:16.280- 25:20.880* :  dysentery, bloody diary, all those things, these are a direct result of what's happening in terms
*25:20.880- 25:24.300* :  of how they are living. And the other thing for us is the fact that it's so much more difficult
*25:24.300- 25:28.560* :  to move around because of one, the congestion, but also because of the law and other problems,
*25:28.560- 25:32.420* :  there's more and more of our goods material getting stolen off the back of trucks.
*25:32.940- 25:39.240* :  Tell us about the security situation for the trucks carrying aid in. Has it become really dangerous?
*25:39.280- 25:43.560* :  I mean, the drivers themselves are taking a risk every time they go there. There's always
*25:43.960- 25:48.000* :  organized, smuggling, organized, looting that goes on there. And what they're doing is that
*25:48.000- 25:50.980* :  they're stopping trucks in certain parts of the road. They know the roads that we use,
*25:50.980- 25:55.280* :  and the times the days we move on. And so they're there before we get there. A lot of times the
*25:55.280- 25:58.640* :  violence involved, I've met truck drivers who've been beaten up by broken arms,
*25:59.020- 26:03.840* :  ones with a box knife that the throats access thrown at them, their windscreens, their cars get
*26:03.840- 26:08.640* :  shattered. And who are they? Who is it who's doing? It's a combination. I mean, we don't know
*26:08.640- 26:11.920* :  actually who they are, but there's obviously some organized sections of that. There's obviously
*26:11.920- 26:15.880* :  very, very desperate people. You can see the amount of people there who have gotten nothing,
*26:15.880- 26:19.640* :  absolutely nothing. And they see a truck gun pass. They think this is my one-in-one
*26:19.640- 26:23.840* :  chance to feed my family. So they go for a bag of flour or a box of food or something. That's the
*26:23.840- 26:29.120* :  only way they can survive. You went to Almawasi, I think. That's the area on the coast that the
*26:29.120- 26:34.260* :  Israelis have been telling people for months to go to as a safe area. What were the conditions
*26:34.460- 26:39.040* :  like there? Well, there's about 250,000 people displaced there and the people still coming because
*26:39.040- 26:43.220* :  they're moving away from RAFA, fearing the incursion that might take place there. And to think
*26:43.220- 26:47.360* :  this space there for the more people to move in, I don't think it's true. When I go there and I've
*26:47.360- 26:50.680* :  been there four or five times over the last few weeks, and every time you go there, more and more
*26:50.680- 26:56.300* :  space is taken up by makeshift shelters and tented camps. There may be some areas closer to the water,
*26:56.300- 27:00.240* :  but that's going to be freezing. It's going to be exposed and it's not somewhere people want to go
*27:00.240- 27:05.360* :  to. So I would say to say that a massive number of people can be accommodated in Almawasi these days,
*27:05.360- 27:10.000* :  I think, is wrong. And if not there, where? Now there are some areas further up from the
*27:10.260- 27:13.520* :  Derribale and all the closest to the coast that way. And then maybe this place is there,
*27:13.760- 27:18.000* :  I haven't gone to, but maybe that's where people will end up going. But we also go to remember,
*27:18.000- 27:22.000* :  people go back to where they came from or people go back to these areas. There's been a lot
*27:22.000- 27:25.820* :  of hostility and a lot of unexploded ordnance. And there's a real worry that people might go back
*27:25.820- 27:30.120* :  there to broken buildings or go to back to their houses again, which have been shelved. And there's
*27:30.120- 27:36.260* :  unexploded ordnance and size of cerebral danger. The UN's Jamie McGultrick. We have seen big
*27:36.260- 27:42.340* :  advances in assistive technology for disabled people over the years, but with more AI being used,
*27:42.340- 27:48.340* :  a revolutionary new type of prosthetic arm for amputees is closing the gap between body and
*27:48.340- 27:54.820* :  biotics without the need for implants or surgery. BBC Clicks Paul Carter, who was born without
*27:54.820- 28:00.600* :  lower arms or legs, has been to California for an exclusive first look at a robotic arm hoping to
*28:00.600- 28:08.540* :  change the way that prosthetics are used. When I reach in and I grab something and I'm getting some
*28:08.540- 28:13.680* :  vibrational feedback here. So that's my indicator that I know that the hand is not going to
*28:13.680- 28:17.860* :  automatically open and drop whatever I'm holding. And so I don't have to sit here and watch my
*28:17.860- 28:23.080* :  the baseball right here in my hand because I know it's got a good grip. Jason lost his left arm in
*28:23.080- 28:28.900* :  an industrial accident in 2012. He's showing me how this prototype of a bionic arm works.
*28:29.680- 28:34.180* :  It looks like a robotic human arm just with a lot more wires coming out of it at present.
*28:34.720- 28:38.700* :  Because you're controlling this right now. You're moving this essentially by thinking about it.
*28:38.820- 28:43.260* :  What's the process that you're going through? I'm still thinking about the motions and I have a
*28:43.260- 28:49.300* :  phantom limb. It still feels like I'm just moving my regular hand. It's a little bit more difficult
*28:49.300- 28:55.140* :  obviously but over time and just with practice I think it's just become easier over the years.
*28:55.600- 29:00.600* :  I was born without lower arms and legs and so I've been around any user of many different
*29:00.600- 29:06.340* :  types and shapes of prosthetics all my life. While I'm not an amputee, I'm told I'll be able to
*29:06.340- 29:12.360* :  try a virtual version which works for me. It doesn't require any surgery or custom made sockets to
*29:12.360- 29:16.900* :  attach the arm. The most advanced state of the art prosthetics we control today is what you call
*29:16.900- 29:23.120* :  my electric control. So that's putting electrodes on your stump residual limb. Tyler Hayes is the
*29:23.120- 29:28.700* :  CEO of Atom Limbs, the company behind this technology. When you first put the arm on you take about
*29:28.700- 29:33.540* :  five minutes and you train it up and what that looks like is we say all right with your phantom limb
*29:33.540- 29:38.100* :  that we can't see but that you can flex your finger. Rotate your wrist, rotate it the other way
*29:38.460- 29:42.900* :  and our machine learning an AI system spits out a result so that now you whenever you think can
*29:42.900- 29:46.740* :  just move. There's nothing in your head, nothing on your head, nothing in your arms, all this
*29:46.740- 29:51.940* :  service electrode and AI that basically powers it. I was able to try a version of the tech by
*29:51.940- 29:57.520* :  strapping some electrodes to my arm which ends just below the elbow and hooking it up to a 3D
*29:57.520- 30:03.680* :  image of the prosthetic on a screen. After a few minutes of training I was able to move the
*30:03.680- 30:09.420* :  virtual arm. This is phenomenal. This is one of the most incredible things I've ever done.
*30:10.120- 30:15.020* :  I was bending the arm at the elbow, turning the wrist and opening and closing the hand.
*30:16.060- 30:21.580* :  I've actively avoided upper arm prosthetics for most of my adult life so this was the first time
*30:21.580- 30:28.080* :  I've tried a bionic arm and it was pretty mind bending. The company is currently gathering data
*30:28.080- 30:34.160* :  ahead of regulatory filings in the US. Exactly how much these arms would be is yet to be confirmed
*30:34.840- 30:39.180* :  though they claim the goal is to make them around the same price as other arms in the US,
*30:39.180- 30:46.320* :  approximately 20,000 dollars. And rivals such as Otto Bock and Ossa may mean that companies compete
*30:46.320- 30:53.500* :  on price. But the hope is that prosthetics in the future will be more affordable, more versatile
*30:54.240- 30:58.900* :  and more intelligent. That was absolutely amazing. That's the best workout I've ever had.
*31:01.180- 31:07.460* :  Paul Carter. Divorce rates have been declining in the European Union since 2006 and it's a
*31:07.460- 31:13.580* :  similar picture in the US. Here in the UK the latest figures show that divorce rates are at their
*31:13.580- 31:20.980* :  lowest level for 50 years. Prem Satchel told us more. Divorce rates in England and Wales are down,
*31:20.980- 31:31.500* :  not just a bit, but a lot, 29.5% so almost a third in 2022. And it is absolutely baffled legal
*31:31.500- 31:37.500* :  experts because they thought actually divorce rates would start to go up. Why? Because there was
*31:37.500- 31:43.400* :  a new piece of legislation which came in in 2022 which was meant to make divorce easier. It got
*31:43.400- 31:50.240* :  rid of the so-called finger pointing blame game around separation. So given that divorce
*31:50.240- 31:57.100* :  were meant to be getting easier, why are the numbers down so much? Well it may be partly because
*31:57.620- 32:03.280* :  in that same piece of legislation there was introduced a so-called cooling off period which means
*32:03.280- 32:08.240* :  it might take a bit longer for divorces to go through. So some of the numbers may be bumped into
*32:08.240- 32:14.060* :  the next year. But actually what most experts say is that this is all down to the cost of living
*32:14.060- 32:20.920* :  crisis that people just can't afford to get divorced. The contemplation of having to run for
*32:20.920- 32:28.520* :  example to houses is just too much. And if you look at the figures going back to the 1950s,
*32:28.520- 32:35.080* :  this is really interesting. So divorce rates went up and up and up peaking in 1993. Since then
*32:35.140- 32:40.480* :  they've kind of gone up and down depending on what the economy is doing. So if there's a recession,
*32:41.380- 32:46.760* :  people stay together. And if the economy's booming, they get divorced. It's nothing to do with
*32:46.760- 32:52.600* :  romance. It's all to do with money. Graham's actual on divorce are indeed the lack of it.
*32:55.020- 32:58.920* :  And that's it from us for now. But before we go, here's Jackie with news of the next
