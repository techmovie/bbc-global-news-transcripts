*00:54.720- 00:58.700* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Saturday, the 17th of February,
*00:58.700- 01:00.400* :  these are our main stories.
*01:01.080- 01:04.920* :  International condemnation of the death of the Russian political activist
*01:05.300- 01:08.780* :  and vocal critic of President Putin, Alexei Navalny.
*01:09.180- 01:11.620* :  The US President is clear where blame lies.
*01:11.940- 01:14.680* :  Putin is responsible for Navalny's death,
*01:14.820- 01:18.920* :  but it's happened in Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality.
*01:19.420- 01:22.540* :  Navalny's widow, Julia, has this warning for the Kremlin.
*01:23.080- 01:25.380* :  They would be held responsible for what they have done
*01:25.380- 01:30.360* :  with our country, with my husband, and with our people.
*01:31.020- 01:33.180* :  We have reaction from Moscow and Munich,
*01:33.180- 01:37.600* :  and we speak to our correspondent about Navalny the man she knew.
*01:39.600- 01:42.400* :  Also in this podcast, Donald Trump is urged to pay more than
*01:42.400- 01:45.280* :  $350 million in penalties,
*01:46.020- 01:48.060* :  following his civil fraud case in New York.
*01:48.340- 01:50.380* :  And after we met,
*01:50.800- 01:51.900* :  not a bit of a crush on you.
*01:52.980- 01:54.340* :  So I haven't to it, it's a crush.
*01:54.700- 01:56.380* :  It's really struck a chord at the moment,
*01:56.380- 01:59.320* :  because we live in such desperate times.
*01:59.840- 02:04.500* :  Why the Netflix rom-com one day has become such a runaway hit.
*02:08.020- 02:10.060* :  Hundreds of protesters, many of them Russian,
*02:10.600- 02:13.140* :  gathered in cities across Europe on Friday,
*02:13.540- 02:14.960* :  all asking the same question,
*02:15.500- 02:17.180* :  what happened to Alexei Navalny?
*02:17.680- 02:20.340* :  The death of the Kremlin critic in a Russian prison
*02:20.340- 02:24.860* :  has caused outrage around the world since it was announced earlier on Friday.
*02:25.520- 02:28.840* :  Mr Navalny was outspoken in his opposition to President Putin
*02:29.220- 02:31.200* :  and had survived poisoning attempts
*02:31.600- 02:34.220* :  and years in some of Russia's toughest jails.
*02:34.680- 02:35.800* :  According to prison officials,
*02:35.800- 02:38.060* :  he suddenly collapsed after a walk.
*02:38.660- 02:40.480* :  We'll be getting the international news shortly,
*02:40.480- 02:42.220* :  but first our Russia editor,
*02:42.600- 02:44.600* :  Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
*02:45.260- 02:46.920* :  Of all the critics and opponents,
*02:46.920- 02:51.840* :  Vladimir Putin has faced, Alexei Navalny was by far the most active
*02:52.420- 02:54.760* :  and the most dangerous, I think, to the authorities.
*02:54.760- 02:57.820* :  He railed against corruption and he was able to bring people
*02:57.820- 03:01.660* :  onto the streets to protest before he himself was put in prison.
*03:02.040- 03:03.660* :  After three years behind bars,
*03:04.100- 03:05.680* :  he's reported to be dead.
*03:08.940- 03:11.720* :  Smiling, cracking jokes,
*03:12.400- 03:14.340* :  this was Alexei Navalny yesterday,
*03:14.920- 03:17.880* :  as he gave testimony from prison by video link,
*03:18.640- 03:20.960* :  even caught officials, cracked a smile.
*03:24.080- 03:26.140* :  Today, Russia's prison service announced
*03:26.140- 03:27.840* :  that Mr Navalny was dead,
*03:28.600- 03:31.700* :  claiming he'd lost consciousness inside this penal colony.
*03:32.620- 03:36.500* :  Russian TV rarely mentions Alexei Navalny.
*03:36.700- 03:39.320* :  It read out the prison service statement about his death
*03:40.060- 03:41.440* :  and moved on to other news.
*03:45.320- 03:47.620* :  He was Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic,
*03:48.160- 03:51.000* :  a protest leader, an anti-corruption campaigner
*03:51.280- 03:52.860* :  who'd long clashed with the Kremlin.
*03:53.540- 03:55.260* :  I remember this six years ago.
*03:55.700- 03:58.980* :  Alexei Navalny is Russia's most prominent opposition figure
*03:59.520- 04:01.800* :  and president Putin's most vocal critic.
*04:02.120- 04:04.900* :  He's been barred from running in the presidential election.
*04:05.740- 04:08.080* :  He's now being arrested by police.
*04:09.820- 04:11.620* :  In 2020, in Siberia,
*04:11.860- 04:13.560* :  he'd been poisoned with a nerve-agent
*04:13.860- 04:16.440* :  and airlifted to Germany for life-saving treatment.
*04:17.120- 04:19.760* :  He accused the Kremlin of trying to assassinate him.
*04:22.220- 04:23.180* :  But as a politician,
*04:23.520- 04:25.480* :  he felt he couldn't stay away from Russia.
*04:28.740- 04:30.260* :  When he returned the following year,
*04:30.740- 04:32.040* :  he was arrested on arrival.
*04:32.800- 04:34.440* :  He'd been in prison ever since.
*04:35.060- 04:37.740* :  His friends and family fearing for his safety.
*04:39.520- 04:42.660* :  Just hours after Alexei Navalny was reported dead,
*04:43.200- 04:45.620* :  his wife, Julia, made a dramatic appearance
*04:46.040- 04:47.640* :  at the Munich Security Conference.
*04:48.620- 04:49.960* :  She couldn't confirm his death.
*04:50.760- 04:51.300* :  But...
*04:53.980- 04:57.320* :  If it's true, I want Putin and his whole entourage,
*04:57.640- 04:59.780* :  his friends and his government to know
*05:00.420- 05:01.760* :  that they will be held responsible
*05:02.400- 05:04.440* :  for everything they've done to our country.
*05:05.140- 05:07.120* :  To my family and to my husband.
*05:07.940- 05:09.940* :  And this day, we'll come very soon.
*05:12.460- 05:14.660* :  President Putin, too, made an appearance today,
*05:15.060- 05:16.340* :  meeting industrial workers.
*05:16.980- 05:19.200* :  He made no mention of Alexei Navalny.
*05:20.400- 05:23.980* :  Alexei Navalny was one of the most charismatic political figures
*05:23.980- 05:25.900* :  in Russia in modern times.
*05:26.420- 05:28.440* :  And the only oppositional leader here
*05:28.800- 05:31.040* :  who appeared capable of bringing large crowds
*05:31.040- 05:33.840* :  onto the streets to protest against the authorities.
*05:34.620- 05:35.380* :  And for that reason,
*05:35.920- 05:37.700* :  the Kremlin saw him as a threat.
*05:39.660- 05:42.280* :  He knew that by taking on the authorities,
*05:42.940- 05:44.180* :  he was taking a risk.
*05:44.620- 05:48.720* :  My message for the situation
*05:48.760- 05:51.620* :  when I'm killed is very simple, not give up.
*05:52.780- 05:55.240* :  In memory of Russia's most famous prisoner,
*05:55.920- 05:57.040* :  some here lay flowers.
*05:58.160- 06:00.480* :  By this simple act, their message,
*06:01.460- 06:02.820* :  we will not forget.
*06:04.060- 06:05.740* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*06:06.520- 06:09.440* :  Well, there's been widespread international condemnation
*06:09.440- 06:10.980* :  of Mr. Navalny's death.
*06:10.980- 06:14.180* :  Here's the U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House.
*06:14.640- 06:15.380* :  Make no mistake.
*06:16.000- 06:18.680* :  Putin is responsible for Navalny's death.
*06:19.500- 06:22.160* :  What has happened in Navalny is yet more proof
*06:22.760- 06:23.840* :  of Putin's brutality.
*06:24.700- 06:25.480* :  No one should be fooled.
*06:25.480- 06:27.900* :  Not in Russia, not at home, not anywhere in the world.
*06:29.000- 06:31.380* :  Putin does not only target his citizens
*06:31.380- 06:33.760* :  of other countries as we've seen
*06:33.760- 06:35.540* :  that was going on in Ukraine right now.
*06:35.540- 06:38.000* :  He also inflicts terrible crimes on his own people.
*06:38.620- 06:40.820* :  Speaking in Berlin, the Ukrainian president,
*06:40.820- 06:43.040* :  Vladimir Zelensky, was equally clear.
*06:46.800- 06:48.620* :  Obviously, he was killed by Putin
*06:48.620- 06:50.900* :  like thousands of others who've been tormented
*06:50.900- 06:53.800* :  and tortured because of this one person.
*06:54.820- 06:56.060* :  Putin doesn't care who dies,
*06:57.000- 06:58.680* :  as long as he retains his position.
*06:59.340- 07:01.480* :  Poland's Foreign Minister Radislav Sokorsky
*07:01.480- 07:03.500* :  told our chief international correspondent
*07:03.500- 07:06.460* :  least to set that Mr. Navalny would be remembered
*07:06.460- 07:10.000* :  as the best Russian president that Russia never had.
*07:10.660- 07:13.300* :  At least spoke to me from the Munich Security Conference
*07:13.300- 07:16.180* :  where many heads of government were assembled
*07:16.740- 07:17.300* :  when the news broke.
*07:18.020- 07:22.260* :  Oh, the mood was absolutely electric.
*07:22.260- 07:25.760* :  It's the news that Navalny was dead just shot
*07:26.320- 07:29.080* :  like a bolt of electricity through the Munich Security Conference
*07:29.620- 07:31.420* :  just at that moment in the morning
*07:31.420- 07:33.540* :  where the limousines were arriving.
*07:33.540- 07:35.840* :  There was a Hababa, the Grand Hotel
*07:35.840- 07:37.180* :  where the conference takes place,
*07:37.520- 07:39.500* :  was filling up with defense chiefs,
*07:39.500- 07:40.840* :  top diplomats, presidents,
*07:41.280- 07:42.560* :  prime ministers, kings, many of them,
*07:42.560- 07:44.940* :  old friends, and then all of a sudden
*07:45.140- 07:47.140* :  this came out of the blue.
*07:47.820- 07:49.680* :  So many were reeling.
*07:50.200- 07:51.560* :  If they didn't know Navalny,
*07:51.560- 07:53.200* :  they knew of Navalny.
*07:53.640- 07:56.280* :  You mentioned the comments of Radislav Sokorsky.
*07:56.280- 07:59.360* :  Many leaders had come to this conference already,
*08:00.020- 08:01.560* :  deeply worried about Russia's
*08:01.820- 08:03.300* :  full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*08:03.760- 08:05.400* :  worrying about Ukraine war,
*08:05.400- 08:08.540* :  and the need to keep supporting Ukrainian forces,
*08:08.540- 08:10.200* :  worried too about the Gaza war.
*08:10.540- 08:11.800* :  There were many dark clouds,
*08:11.800- 08:17.060* :  and then suddenly this one came and blotted out everything else.
*08:17.540- 08:19.900* :  But to a person, whether it was Yen Stoltenberg,
*08:19.900- 08:21.760* :  the NATO Secretary General saying
*08:21.760- 08:24.040* :  Russia has a lot of questions to answer.
*08:24.580- 08:25.700* :  We went to see Lord Cameron,
*08:25.700- 08:26.860* :  the British Foreign Secretary,
*08:27.360- 08:29.200* :  blaming Vladimir Putin personally.
*08:30.020- 08:33.000* :  But the moment which will go down in history,
*08:33.520- 08:34.960* :  which stunned the hall,
*08:35.540- 08:37.860* :  when Yulia Navalny was known,
*08:37.860- 08:39.240* :  she was at the conference somewhere,
*08:39.240- 08:40.400* :  everyone asked, where was she?
*08:40.400- 08:42.680* :  We saw her going into through the main door,
*08:43.360- 08:45.180* :  and onto the, not just the stage,
*08:45.180- 08:49.620* :  but a world stage, so calm, so composed,
*08:50.000- 08:52.100* :  at a moment of her greatest grief.
*08:52.640- 08:56.160* :  Was the surprise at the timing of Alexei Navalny's death,
*08:56.280- 09:00.440* :  because he was seen yesterday laughing and joking,
*09:00.820- 09:01.660* :  and apparently well?
*09:02.080- 09:04.100* :  Many are asking about the timing.
*09:04.100- 09:05.720* :  There was a discussion, of course,
*09:06.500- 09:08.340* :  and for those who blame Vladimir Putin,
*09:08.340- 09:10.020* :  hold him responsible, did he do it?
*09:10.480- 09:13.580* :  When he knew many Western leaders were gathered here,
*09:13.580- 09:14.900* :  that Russia was on the agenda,
*09:15.380- 09:17.500* :  at a time when there was no Russian official here,
*09:17.540- 09:20.980* :  that the death of Navalny would be thrust onto the agenda.
*09:21.600- 09:23.300* :  Many believed that wasn't the case,
*09:23.300- 09:25.620* :  but some did mention this video,
*09:26.220- 09:27.720* :  how well Navalny looked,
*09:28.160- 09:29.540* :  how he was cracking jokes,
*09:29.540- 09:31.660* :  even talking about the judge in his trial,
*09:32.060- 09:34.740* :  telling him that he'd have to send some of his big salary,
*09:34.740- 09:37.700* :  because Navalny's account was running low.
*09:37.700- 09:40.960* :  He just seemed to be making fun of his situation.
*09:40.960- 09:46.340* :  That would not be the image that his jailers would want him to show.
*09:46.340- 09:49.720* :  There was some suggestion here that that was the last straw.
*09:49.720- 09:51.040* :  It's speculation, of course,
*09:51.740- 09:53.880* :  but it was an image that someone who wanted him dead
*09:53.880- 09:54.780* :  didn't want to see.
*09:55.360- 09:56.120* :  Least you said,
*09:56.760- 09:58.140* :  the European Commission President,
*09:58.140- 09:59.400* :  Asula von der Lein,
*09:59.400- 10:00.520* :  has also spoken out,
*10:00.520- 10:02.860* :  saying the world has lost a freedom fighter.
*10:03.620- 10:07.900* :  Putin fears nothing more than the descent from his own people.
*10:08.480- 10:10.640* :  Putin and his friends fear nothing more than people
*10:10.640- 10:11.520* :  that speak up,
*10:11.940- 10:13.300* :  that fight for freedom,
*10:13.340- 10:17.460* :  and that fight against corruption like Alexei Navalny did it.
*10:18.000- 10:21.980* :  The world has lost a freedom fighter in Alexei Navalny.
*10:21.980- 10:23.160* :  We will honor his name,
*10:23.900- 10:24.760* :  and in his name,
*10:24.940- 10:27.660* :  we will stand up for democracy and for our values.
*10:28.640- 10:30.640* :  Your regional editor, Danny Eberhard,
*10:30.640- 10:32.120* :  tell me more about reaction.
*10:33.200- 10:35.720* :  In Russia itself, as Steve alluded to earlier,
*10:36.040- 10:38.160* :  there have been some people turning up,
*10:38.280- 10:40.440* :  putting in flowers and photos and candles
*10:40.860- 10:41.540* :  on memorials,
*10:41.540- 10:43.500* :  such as the Solovetsky Stone in Moscow.
*10:43.500- 10:46.340* :  That's the place where victims of political repression
*10:46.340- 10:47.320* :  is commemorated there,
*10:47.540- 10:51.280* :  also in St. Petersburg and other cities like Kazan.
*10:51.640- 10:53.500* :  But obviously, the numbers of people
*10:53.500- 10:56.460* :  that are not like after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*10:57.060- 10:58.700* :  Moscow, obviously, has done all it can
*10:58.700- 11:02.000* :  to repress a free speech since then,
*11:02.300- 11:03.660* :  and people, I think, are scared.
*11:03.660- 11:07.560* :  So numbers are relatively small at the moment, at least.
*11:08.080- 11:09.760* :  And outside of Russia,
*11:10.200- 11:12.940* :  we've seen lots of people gather outside Russian embassies,
*11:12.940- 11:14.880* :  for example, in London,
*11:14.880- 11:16.800* :  there have seen signs like Putin,
*11:16.800- 11:19.660* :  is a murderer, a person dressed as the grim reaper
*11:19.660- 11:20.840* :  with a sign called Killers,
*11:21.200- 11:24.000* :  other saying, we are Navalny or the dream lives on.
*11:24.100- 11:26.480* :  So there's some signs of defiance there,
*11:26.480- 11:28.020* :  as well as lots of mourning.
*11:28.800- 11:30.880* :  Danny Eberhardt, and we'll return to the death
*11:30.880- 11:33.540* :  of Alexin Navalny later in the podcast.
*11:34.880- 11:36.280* :  Donald Trump has been ordered to pay
*11:36.280- 11:39.420* :  more than $350 million in penalties
*11:39.420- 11:42.000* :  in his civil fraud trial in New York,
*11:42.400- 11:45.860* :  a judge found him liable for falsely altering his net worth
*11:45.860- 11:48.180* :  to receive tax and insurance benefits.
*11:48.820- 11:51.240* :  The judge also ordered an independent monitor
*11:51.240- 11:53.620* :  to oversee the Trump organization
*11:53.620- 11:55.140* :  for the next three years.
*11:55.800- 11:57.120* :  A lawyer for the former president
*11:57.120- 12:00.380* :  has described the ruling as a manifest injustice.
*12:00.880- 12:03.160* :  With more, he has net a topic in New York.
*12:03.840- 12:07.120* :  Financially, this verdict is a massive blow to Donald Trump.
*12:07.120- 12:10.640* :  He has been ordered to pay $355 million,
*12:11.020- 12:14.120* :  far more than he has on hand in cash.
*12:14.560- 12:17.980* :  But his empire was spared from one of the worst potential scenarios,
*12:17.980- 12:21.020* :  the cancellation of its business licenses,
*12:21.640- 12:23.300* :  known as the corporate death penalty.
*12:23.340- 12:26.860* :  Instead, the judge ordered two tiers of oversight,
*12:26.860- 12:31.000* :  an independent monitor to report to the court for up to three years
*12:31.000- 12:35.140* :  and a separate independent director of compliance to be installed.
*12:35.780- 12:39.720* :  Prosecutors wanted Mr. Trump to be banned from the property industry
*12:39.720- 12:43.060* :  in New York that catapulted him to international fame
*12:43.060- 12:45.060* :  and ultimately the White House.
*12:45.060- 12:48.120* :  But instead, the judge barred him for three years.
*12:48.120- 12:50.780* :  The judge said his decisions were necessary
*12:50.780- 12:53.760* :  to protect the integrity of the marketplace in New York,
*12:53.760- 12:55.860* :  the financial capital of the world.
*12:55.860- 13:00.120* :  He also criticized the defendants for not showing remorse.
*13:00.600- 13:02.380* :  In a statement, Trump called the verdict
*13:02.380- 13:04.680* :  undeniable election interference.
*13:04.680- 13:07.820* :  His family and lawyers called the ruling unfair
*13:07.820- 13:10.060* :  and indicated they planned to appeal.
*13:10.820- 13:11.600* :  Neutrophic.
*13:12.280- 13:14.720* :  With Israel promising a major ground assault
*13:14.720- 13:16.780* :  in the southern Gaza City of Raffa,
*13:17.180- 13:20.300* :  security sources say Egypt is setting up a buffer zone
*13:20.440- 13:22.600* :  on its side of the border with the territory,
*13:23.000- 13:24.900* :  in case a large number of Palestinians
*13:25.260- 13:26.260* :  try to flee the strip.
*13:26.820- 13:29.060* :  Egypt has denied making such preparations
*13:29.060- 13:32.120* :  and says any process of moving Palestinians
*13:32.120- 13:34.640* :  into Egypt would be unacceptable.
*13:35.300- 13:37.120* :  But satellite images appear to show
*13:37.120- 13:39.320* :  construction work underway in the area.
*13:39.920- 13:42.800* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams told me more.
*13:43.280- 13:45.900* :  It's not clear exactly what it is for
*13:45.900- 13:49.460* :  and Egyptian officials are being pretty coy about it,
*13:49.460- 13:51.580* :  but on the face of it, it does look like
*13:51.880- 13:53.640* :  some kind of provisional measure
*13:53.640- 13:58.040* :  designed to house a significant number of refugees
*13:58.660- 14:01.860* :  should they end up crossing out of the Gaza Strip
*14:01.980- 14:07.380* :  into Egypt in the advent of an Israeli assault on Raffa.
*14:07.380- 14:10.900* :  Now, the Israelis are saying they have absolutely
*14:10.900- 14:14.820* :  no intention of driving anyone out of the Gaza Strip.
*14:14.820- 14:17.920* :  We heard that directly from Israel's Defence Minister,
*14:17.920- 14:20.720* :  you have glant in a briefing to us earlier today.
*14:21.560- 14:24.540* :  Although I think, you know, should the situation arise
*14:24.820- 14:27.180* :  where a significant number of Palestinians
*14:28.000- 14:30.520* :  who right now are confused and don't know where to go
*14:31.000- 14:33.820* :  decide that they would prefer to seek shelter
*14:34.460- 14:36.500* :  over the border, just inside Egypt,
*14:36.600- 14:39.260* :  then Israel is clearly not going to stand in their way.
*14:39.260- 14:43.400* :  We have not yet heard of any offer of that from the Egyptians,
*14:43.900- 14:45.620* :  but it's hard to see what this enclosure
*14:45.640- 14:48.140* :  being built really close to the border
*14:48.580- 14:51.220* :  could possibly be for unless it is to house
*14:51.640- 14:52.660* :  Palestinian refugees.
*14:53.100- 14:57.380* :  I was in contact with a young lady in Raffa earlier this evening
*14:58.020- 15:01.700* :  and she said these rumors are just fueling a sense of
*15:02.060- 15:05.260* :  confusion that is swirling around Raffa right now
*15:05.260- 15:07.860* :  with people, frankly, not knowing where they should go.
*15:08.160- 15:09.740* :  Should they think about heading for the border?
*15:09.740- 15:12.080* :  Should they head west towards the coast,
*15:12.560- 15:15.800* :  north into open areas, north of Raffa?
*15:15.820- 15:17.820* :  They simply don't know and they're exhausted.
*15:18.540- 15:22.320* :  Paul Adams, many countries around the world are struggling to cope
*15:22.320- 15:23.920* :  with the cost of living crisis.
*15:24.500- 15:26.820* :  In Nigeria, the currency has hit record low
*15:26.820- 15:29.200* :  as against the dollar and this week inflation
*15:29.200- 15:31.200* :  climbed to its highest level in years.
*15:31.860- 15:33.960* :  Many blame President Bollard Tanubu's decision
*15:34.280- 15:36.800* :  to phase out costly fuel subsidies.
*15:37.400- 15:39.920* :  That in turn has fueled increased food prices
*15:40.280- 15:42.300* :  because of additional transportation costs
*15:42.700- 15:44.960* :  from higher petrol and butane prices.
*15:45.580- 15:48.240* :  But as our Africa Regional Editor, Julian Bedford reports,
*15:48.760- 15:52.200* :  one state governor has caught with a rather unorthodox solution
*15:52.200- 15:55.280* :  for those struggling to put food on the table.
*15:55.780- 15:58.500* :  In a television address to the people of Borno State,
*15:59.140- 16:01.640* :  Governor Baba Gana Zulum said he was deeply
*16:01.640- 16:04.280* :  pained by the hardships families faced
*16:04.740- 16:08.720* :  and outlined a series of measures to address rising food prices.
*16:09.560- 16:12.580* :  These included investment in modern farming techniques
*16:13.120- 16:16.260* :  and support for local farmers to boost crop yields.
*16:16.960- 16:20.000* :  But Mr Zulum then sought divine intervention.
*16:20.060- 16:23.420* :  He decreed a one day fast this coming Monday
*16:23.420- 16:27.460* :  and urged his electorate, Muslims and Christians alike
*16:27.500- 16:30.840* :  to pray while fasting for peace, prosperity,
*16:30.840- 16:32.680* :  and the development of the state.
*16:33.460- 16:36.420* :  At least that's one day's less food bills to worry about.
*16:37.600- 16:38.380* :  Julian Bedford.
*16:40.780- 16:42.520* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*16:43.040- 16:44.700* :  How did you get the news that the king was out?
*16:45.260- 16:45.980* :  Um, I spoke to him.
*16:46.200- 16:46.840* :  And what did you next?
*16:47.880- 16:49.740* :  I jumped on a plane and went to see if it was as I could.
*16:50.400- 16:53.280* :  Prince Harry speaks to the media for the first time
*16:53.280- 16:57.200* :  since his father, King Charles, was diagnosed with cancer.
*17:05.840- 17:08.660* :  Senegal's president, Maggie Sal, says he'll abide
*17:08.660- 17:11.060* :  by the ruling of the Constitutional Council
*17:11.480- 17:14.340* :  and start talks to hold elections as soon as possible.
*17:14.340- 17:17.560* :  The council said the postponement of presidential elections
*17:17.560- 17:20.120* :  scheduled for later this month was unlawful.
*17:20.480- 17:22.120* :  Here's our West Africa correspondent,
*17:22.540- 17:23.040* :  Ayane Jones.
*17:23.580- 17:26.740* :  Ever since he announced he wanted to delay the elections two weeks ago,
*17:27.160- 17:30.880* :  President Maggie Sal has been under immense pressure to reverse his decision.
*17:31.600- 17:33.800* :  Now that pressure appears to have yielded results.
*17:33.900- 17:38.520* :  In a statement, the president, he said Mr. Sal would comply with the council's ruling.
*17:39.160- 17:42.600* :  It added that the Senegalese president would hold talks with all relevant stakeholders
*17:42.600- 17:45.900* :  without delay in order to hold elections as soon as possible.
*17:46.600- 17:48.520* :  A new date for the elections hasn't been given,
*17:48.540- 17:51.780* :  but in its ruling, the Constitutional Council said the president
*17:51.780- 17:54.960* :  couldn't stay in power beyond the end of his term on the 2nd of April,
*17:55.320- 17:57.560* :  following the ruling France and the European Union
*17:57.620- 17:59.580* :  urge Mr. Sal to comply with the decision.
*18:00.320- 18:03.520* :  There's been stronger position to Mr Sal's decision to postpone the elections
*18:03.520- 18:04.500* :  until mid-December.
*18:05.040- 18:08.000* :  Protesters have taken to the streets and opposition politicians
*18:08.000- 18:10.000* :  have lodged legal complaints against him.
*18:10.560- 18:13.580* :  Religious authorities and regional bodies have also called for elections
*18:13.580- 18:14.940* :  to be held as soon as possible.
*18:15.480- 18:18.640* :  Senegal is considered one of West Africa's most stable democracies,
*18:19.060- 18:21.500* :  and is the only one of its neighbours never to have suffered a coup.
*18:22.480- 18:23.140* :  Mayany Jones.
*18:23.880- 18:27.880* :  King Charles II's son, Prince Harry, has spoken publicly for the first time
*18:28.280- 18:30.920* :  since the announcement of the King's cancer diagnosis.
*18:31.520- 18:33.540* :  The Prince told American breakfast television
*18:33.940- 18:37.120* :  that his father's diagnosis could bring the royal family closer.
*18:37.800- 18:39.940* :  He was talking from the Canadian town of Whistler,
*18:40.120- 18:43.040* :  where he's visiting the training camp for the Invictus Games,
*18:43.040- 18:47.100* :  which Harry set up for injured military personnel and veterans.
*18:47.180- 18:49.280* :  From there, here's Emma Vardy.
*18:49.740- 18:53.800* :  Nearly a fortnight on from his short trip back to Britain to see his father,
*18:54.420- 18:57.540* :  Prince Harry and Meghan stepped out in the snow to meet athletes
*18:58.080- 18:59.740* :  one year ahead of the Invictus Games.
*19:00.900- 19:03.320* :  Speaking to one of America's biggest morning shows,
*19:03.800- 19:06.920* :  this is the first interview the Prince has given for more than a year.
*19:07.860- 19:11.040* :  The King, he said, had told him personally about his diagnosis.
*19:11.480- 19:13.160* :  How did you get the news that the King was up?
*19:13.720- 19:14.400* :  I spoke to him.
*19:14.660- 19:15.300* :  And what did you next?
*19:16.340- 19:18.180* :  I jumped on a plane and went to see him as soon as I could.
*19:18.900- 19:20.140* :  How was that visit for you emotionally?
*19:21.200- 19:22.220* :  Look, I love my family.
*19:22.220- 19:25.160* :  The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him
*19:25.160- 19:27.320* :  and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.
*19:27.740- 19:30.480* :  What sort of your outlook on his health?
*19:30.960- 19:32.280* :  That stays between me and him.
*19:32.380- 19:34.500* :  The Prince agreed with the interviewer's suggestion
*19:34.500- 19:36.860* :  that illness could bring families together,
*19:37.340- 19:39.320* :  since stepping back as working royals,
*19:39.640- 19:41.940* :  saying they wanted space to raise their children
*19:41.940- 19:44.100* :  and frustrated with Buckingham Palace.
*19:44.720- 19:47.620* :  Harry and Meghan have been rebranding their image in the US.
*19:48.360- 19:50.740* :  Their new website describes their aim
*19:50.740- 19:53.780* :  as shaping the future through business and philanthropy.
*19:53.780- 19:56.460* :  The Prince said we may see him back in the UK
*19:56.460- 19:58.160* :  more often in the months to come.
*19:59.000- 20:02.180* :  But after his grievances were laid bare last year in his book,
*20:02.680- 20:04.900* :  a reconciliation still feels a way off.
*20:05.740- 20:09.240* :  Emma Vardy, almost every large passenger plane
*20:09.240- 20:12.000* :  that's flown in the Western world is built by Airbus
*20:12.320- 20:14.000* :  or its American rival Boeing.
*20:14.600- 20:16.240* :  The European group has held the crown
*20:16.240- 20:18.700* :  as the world's largest plane maker by deliveries
*20:19.160- 20:20.520* :  for the past five years.
*20:21.000- 20:22.720* :  But the boss of Airbus has told the BBC
*20:22.720- 20:26.460* :  it's not moving fast enough on reducing carbon emissions.
*20:27.580- 20:31.480* :  John Forri's comments came as the company announced operating profits
*20:31.880- 20:35.060* :  of almost $6.2 billion for 2023.
*20:35.960- 20:38.180* :  That's up 4% on the previous year.
*20:38.640- 20:41.780* :  He spoke to Philistee Hannah about the past year's performance.
*20:42.580- 20:46.240* :  We had a lot of challenges bit on the more geopolitical situation
*20:46.240- 20:49.720* :  and the complexity of the situation for the supply chain.
*20:49.780- 20:51.780* :  That's an issue for everyone in the industry.
*20:51.780- 20:53.080* :  Well, a lot of bottlenecks.
*20:53.420- 20:56.180* :  But overall, a good year has been very happy
*20:56.180- 20:58.340* :  with the level of new orders we had
*20:58.820- 21:00.480* :  and the way we are helping up our activities.
*21:00.480- 21:03.220* :  Overall, I would say satisfied with the outcome.
*21:03.680- 21:06.320* :  Your major rival Boeing is also having a challenging year
*21:06.320- 21:09.100* :  after a door blew out on a flight in early January.
*21:09.600- 21:12.060* :  Are you ramping up production of your own aircraft
*21:12.060- 21:13.420* :  in response to that?
*21:13.780- 21:15.860* :  We're romping up the production of our aircraft
*21:15.960- 21:17.260* :  because we have a lot of contracts
*21:17.260- 21:19.260* :  that we have signed for delivery of planes.
*21:19.760- 21:21.940* :  Actually, we find ourselves with a record backlog
*21:21.940- 21:25.020* :  of 8,600 planes by end of last year.
*21:25.440- 21:28.720* :  But we have our own priorities to serve our customers
*21:28.720- 21:30.860* :  based on what we have already committed to.
*21:31.240- 21:33.320* :  And in the current complex environment,
*21:33.320- 21:34.300* :  we're operating in.
*21:34.380- 21:36.120* :  That's the challenges ahead of us.
*21:36.600- 21:37.800* :  Do you think those issues at Boeing
*21:37.800- 21:40.420* :  have increased scrutiny internally
*21:40.420- 21:42.640* :  and externally of the safety of your planes?
*21:43.740- 21:45.380* :  Quality and safety is something
*21:45.380- 21:48.840* :  that you have to constantly rework and re-challenge
*21:48.840- 21:50.840* :  our own processes, the way we work,
*21:51.300- 21:54.120* :  the onboarding, training, qualification of our teams,
*21:54.120- 21:56.020* :  the management of the supply chain.
*21:56.520- 21:58.120* :  And we are constantly challenged.
*21:58.120- 22:00.340* :  And when we are not challenged by external events,
*22:00.340- 22:03.180* :  sure, we want to make sure that we challenge ourselves
*22:03.600- 22:06.880* :  to not be complacent and be always with the front foot forward
*22:06.880- 22:08.160* :  on those difficult topics.
*22:09.020- 22:13.040* :  Your sustainability plans include hydrogen-powered aircraft
*22:13.040- 22:15.460* :  planning to launch those by 2035.
*22:15.500- 22:16.840* :  Will the technology be ready?
*22:17.300- 22:20.720* :  Yes, this technology is not a brand new technology.
*22:20.720- 22:23.060* :  What is new is to bring it to commercial aviation.
*22:23.760- 22:26.520* :  There are three main areas where we need to be ready.
*22:26.520- 22:29.200* :  One is the product, so the technology is in the product.
*22:29.660- 22:33.020* :  Then we have to deal as well with the new regulatory framework
*22:33.020- 22:35.420* :  that needs to be invented and put in place.
*22:35.880- 22:37.380* :  And we need, as well, the regulatory framework
*22:37.380- 22:39.260* :  to certify a hydrogen plane.
*22:40.080- 22:43.100* :  Do you agree that perhaps one key way to reduce emissions
*22:43.100- 22:44.520* :  will be for people to fly less?
*22:45.120- 22:46.300* :  No, I don't agree with this.
*22:46.300- 22:49.020* :  Plains are fantastic modes of transport,
*22:49.100- 22:51.860* :  but we have the challenge of carbon and it's on us
*22:52.000- 22:55.140* :  to find a way to combine growth, demand for aviation
*22:55.740- 22:57.680* :  with the constraints or with the urgency
*22:58.200- 22:59.440* :  to address climate change
*22:59.440- 23:02.400* :  and therefore accelerating on decarbonisation of aviation.
*23:02.400- 23:05.160* :  Ultimately, I want our children and grandchildren
*23:05.160- 23:07.500* :  to be able to enjoy flying on the planet.
*23:07.500- 23:09.900* :  I think that's very useful and important
*23:09.900- 23:13.780* :  for the human community living in peace together on this planet.
*23:13.780- 23:17.740* :  But we have to be very fast on decarbonising those products
*23:17.860- 23:19.960* :  and that's what Airbus is very committed
*23:19.960- 23:22.100* :  to delivering to the humankind.
*23:22.700- 23:25.660* :  Are you confident that you're moving fast enough?
*23:26.140- 23:27.720* :  No, no, we are not moving fast enough.
*23:28.300- 23:29.520* :  Climate change is an urgency
*23:29.780- 23:31.620* :  and I would love to be able to go faster.
*23:31.780- 23:33.100* :  And that's why we've put sustainability
*23:33.900- 23:35.200* :  front and centre at Airbus.
*23:35.240- 23:36.960* :  That's why we are advocating.
*23:36.960- 23:39.080* :  That's why we want to play the role of catalyst
*23:39.080- 23:41.320* :  in the industry, outside of the industry,
*23:41.720- 23:43.840* :  to accelerate the transition to south
*23:43.840- 23:45.220* :  and to decarbonise technologies.
*23:45.640- 23:46.640* :  That's what we're trying to do.
*23:46.640- 23:49.260* :  And I am absolutely convinced as a community
*23:49.260- 23:51.340* :  inside the aerospace and outside,
*23:51.340- 23:52.700* :  we are not fast enough.
*23:53.400- 23:55.820* :  Diome Forri, chief executive of Airbus,
*23:56.320- 23:57.900* :  speaking to Philistihana.
*23:59.140- 24:01.740* :  The family of the Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson
*24:02.120- 24:03.740* :  have asked a court to have him placed
*24:04.120- 24:05.660* :  under a conservatorship.
*24:06.160- 24:08.920* :  The 81-year-old is an illness similar to dementia
*24:09.300- 24:10.480* :  as Mark Savage reports.
*24:15.860- 24:18.680* :  Brian Wilson's sophisticated and complex melodies
*24:19.180- 24:22.300* :  made the Beach Boys one of the most influential acts of their era.
*24:22.960- 24:25.660* :  But court documents filed in Los Angeles this week
*24:26.020- 24:28.640* :  say the 81-year-old now has cognitive problems
*24:28.640- 24:31.600* :  and is unable to provide for his own personal needs.
*24:32.280- 24:33.820* :  His family have asked for the musician
*24:34.200- 24:37.080* :  to be placed under the care of two long-time associates.
*24:38.020- 24:41.260* :  In a statement, the family said he had been consulted on the move
*24:41.580- 24:43.240* :  and would remain at home with his children
*24:43.600- 24:45.620* :  where he will continue to work on music.
*24:48.900- 24:52.860* :  Mark Savage, the Netflix adaptation of One Day
*24:52.860- 24:55.500* :  has become its most watched UK show
*24:55.900- 24:57.620* :  since its release just over a week ago.
*24:58.200- 25:00.500* :  An adaptation of a David Nichols novel
*25:00.500- 25:03.300* :  the series has gained enormous critical acclaim
*25:03.300- 25:05.660* :  and even more importantly for the streamer
*25:05.920- 25:08.820* :  a whopping number of viewers have actually watched it.
*25:09.280- 25:11.180* :  It follows the success of other adaptations
*25:11.180- 25:13.460* :  like Sally Rooney's Normal People.
*25:14.140- 25:17.740* :  So, is this the golden age of the romantic comedy
*25:18.040- 25:19.580* :  also known as The Rom Com?
*25:20.260- 25:22.320* :  Anita Anand spoke to Judu Moise
*25:22.540- 25:24.300* :  who wrote the hit Me Before You
*25:24.480- 25:25.920* :  and to Helen Fielding
*25:26.240- 25:28.920* :  creator of the now legendary romcom icon
*25:29.460- 25:30.100* :  Bridget Jones.
*25:30.680- 25:32.480* :  And Anita has started by asking Helen
*25:32.480- 25:34.320* :  what she thought of One Day.
*25:34.860- 25:36.400* :  Well, I absolutely love it.
*25:36.500- 25:37.820* :  In fact, I work at this morning
*25:37.820- 25:39.700* :  and spent like an hour and a half watching it
*25:39.880- 25:43.220* :  and the fact that people have so related to it
*25:43.720- 25:46.780* :  I think is just a wonderful affirmation
*25:47.100- 25:51.060* :  of really good writing and really good acting and directing.
*25:51.820- 25:52.520* :  It's just great.
*25:52.840- 25:54.620* :  It seems like the recipe has just come together
*25:54.620- 25:55.740* :  so beautifully, Judu.
*25:55.880- 25:57.380* :  And I think there is something in that, isn't there?
*25:57.380- 25:59.440* :  And David Nichols' book, too, and the adaptation
*25:59.580- 26:02.920* :  it's embraced the imperfection in each other in ourselves.
*26:03.120- 26:06.120* :  Well, I think all good love stories depend on character
*26:06.500- 26:08.860* :  and those are two incredibly well-drawn
*26:08.860- 26:10.680* :  and three-dimensional characters.
*26:11.160- 26:12.200* :  After we met.
*26:12.620- 26:13.720* :  Not out of it for crush on you.
*26:14.800- 26:15.640* :  So, I haven't had it.
*26:16.300- 26:16.720* :  It's crush.
*26:17.360- 26:19.020* :  And I always get quite crush
*26:19.020- 26:22.120* :  when people talk about romcoms in a sniffy way
*26:22.120- 26:26.320* :  because if you can't create those really real characters
*26:26.520- 26:28.200* :  nobody's going to come along for the story.
*26:28.420- 26:31.240* :  But I think also it's really struck a chord at the moment
*26:31.240- 26:34.360* :  because we live in such desperate times.
*26:34.980- 26:39.020* :  It's just been so gloomy for four, five years
*26:39.160- 26:41.900* :  we've just really felt that we're done in the dumps
*26:41.900- 26:45.780* :  and sometimes you just want to watch something reassuring
*26:46.140- 26:47.780* :  where perhaps good things happen.
*26:47.980- 26:50.260* :  Helen, just coming back to you in the grim old times.
*26:51.000- 26:51.900* :  It's interesting, isn't it?
*26:51.960- 26:53.940* :  Because there was a time we would have sort of looked
*26:53.940- 26:57.340* :  for the glossy, the pretty, the thing that was, you know,
*26:57.340- 26:58.680* :  sort of most perfectly made up
*26:58.680- 27:00.280* :  and we're not doing that right now.
*27:00.320- 27:02.460* :  We're looking for love, yes.
*27:02.460- 27:04.460* :  But it can be flawed love, too.
*27:04.880- 27:07.120* :  Well, I think what's very interesting is the way that
*27:07.300- 27:10.160* :  relationships have changed a huge amount
*27:10.160- 27:11.580* :  even in the past few years
*27:12.280- 27:14.720* :  since the pandemic and since me, too.
*27:15.300- 27:17.780* :  And I think in things like one day in normal people
*27:17.780- 27:21.440* :  you see a shift in the dynamic and the power balance
*27:21.440- 27:24.820* :  between men and women, which is really interesting
*27:24.820- 27:25.600* :  and current.
*27:27.040- 27:27.960* :  You look really well.
*27:29.300- 27:31.300* :  I know. It's classic me.
*27:32.180- 27:33.280* :  Came to college and got pretty.
*27:33.440- 27:35.180* :  Very right. But I also agree with JoJo
*27:35.180- 27:39.040* :  that this is a time when it's such a scary world out there
*27:39.060- 27:42.660* :  that everyone has got almost like a huge computer program
*27:42.660- 27:44.340* :  running in the back of their heads.
*27:45.020- 27:47.420* :  And so to see something joyful
*27:47.420- 27:50.260* :  and which is about love and relationships
*27:50.260- 27:52.660* :  and people trying to do the right thing
*27:52.660- 27:55.640* :  does seem to be something people are very drawn to.
*27:55.880- 27:57.980* :  JoJo, you said that, you know, people have been sniffy
*27:57.980- 27:59.420* :  about romcoms in the past.
*27:59.460- 28:01.660* :  I mean, do you sense that landscape is changing
*28:01.660- 28:03.640* :  because it's making money for the streamers
*28:03.640- 28:05.280* :  and it seems to be making money for channels?
*28:05.600- 28:08.080* :  You have films that are centered around relationships.
*28:08.140- 28:09.740* :  People go flock into them.
*28:09.740- 28:12.140* :  If you look like, look at things like past lives.
*28:12.640- 28:14.240* :  There's a word in Korean.
*28:15.620- 28:16.040* :  In-yan.
*28:17.320- 28:20.320* :  It means providence or fate.
*28:20.820- 28:24.000* :  What it was was a really intricate look at human relationships
*28:24.220- 28:25.700* :  and now that's been also nominated.
*28:25.700- 28:28.160* :  I feel like there has always been an appetite.
*28:28.160- 28:31.080* :  It's just that often it's been slightly ignored.
*28:31.280- 28:34.700* :  But also, I would say that the romcom itself is diversifying.
*28:34.700- 28:36.620* :  They're becoming more ethnically diverse.
*28:36.620- 28:38.580* :  There's heart-stopper on television,
*28:38.820- 28:41.760* :  which is a kind of young gay male romcom.
*28:42.040- 28:44.980* :  I think, you know, it doesn't all have to fit a formula
*28:45.380- 28:47.020* :  anymore, if it ever did, actually.
*28:47.420- 28:49.220* :  And I think what's going to be really interesting
*28:49.220- 28:51.980* :  is when the Gen Z start writing.
*28:52.420- 28:55.580* :  All the dynamics in terms of sex and relationships
*28:55.580- 28:58.200* :  and how things work are really different
*28:58.260- 29:00.420* :  from how they were 20 years ago.
*29:00.500- 29:02.820* :  And that's going to be really fun when they start writing.
*29:03.080- 29:04.640* :  JoJo, I mean, I heard you saying in the background,
*29:04.640- 29:06.840* :  yes, yes, yes, this is going to be very exciting.
*29:07.140- 29:10.060* :  I'm just fascinated by the new rules of everything.
*29:10.380- 29:11.200* :  Who knows what's coming,
*29:11.240- 29:13.400* :  but let's hope they do it with some great writing.
*29:13.940- 29:16.600* :  The author's JoJo Moise and Helen Fielding,
*29:16.920- 29:19.140* :  speaking there to Anita Annand.
*29:21.160- 29:23.580* :  Before we end this edition of the Global News Podcast,
*29:23.580- 29:26.580* :  let's look back at Alexei Navalny's life
*29:26.600- 29:28.860* :  and ask what kind of man was he?
*29:29.380- 29:32.740* :  Friends paint a picture of someone with exceptional charisma
*29:33.140- 29:34.780* :  and a sarcastic sense of humor.
*29:35.440- 29:38.560* :  At what proved to be his last court appearance on Thursday,
*29:38.560- 29:42.000* :  he teased the judge for the repeated finds he was facing
*29:42.520- 29:44.720* :  and suggested the judge could reimburse him
*29:44.980- 29:47.160* :  from his huge federal salary.
*30:00.620- 30:02.260* :  But he knew the dangers he faced.
*30:02.820- 30:05.440* :  This was Alexei Navalny talking in a CNN
*30:05.440- 30:07.440* :  and HBO Max documentary.
*30:12.240- 30:14.180* :  Something very obvious to tell you,
*30:14.900- 30:16.320* :  you're not allowed to give up.
*30:17.260- 30:18.360* :  If they decide to kill me,
*30:18.920- 30:20.700* :  it means we're incredibly strong.
*30:21.760- 30:25.060* :  We need to utilize this power to not give up.
*30:25.940- 30:28.100* :  I used to in Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford
*30:28.500- 30:30.640* :  met Alexei Navalny in person.
*30:31.200- 30:34.600* :  He was a character with an incredibly strong personality,
*30:34.660- 30:38.080* :  a very, very driven man, a very energetic man,
*30:38.380- 30:40.120* :  a man of great political passions.
*30:40.220- 30:42.640* :  I would say he was very much defined by his vision
*30:42.640- 30:44.440* :  for Russia and for his political fight.
*30:44.600- 30:46.800* :  So over the many years I spent in Russia
*30:46.800- 30:47.880* :  and the many times I met him,
*30:48.060- 30:50.720* :  I would say he was always very, very focused.
*30:50.780- 30:54.140* :  I mean, yes, he has a very sharp sense of humor.
*30:54.140- 30:57.820* :  He's constantly joking, but he was very defiant,
*30:57.820- 31:00.700* :  very strong, very focused on his politics.
*31:00.700- 31:03.620* :  And his speeches were extremely compelling,
*31:03.620- 31:04.340* :  fairly simple.
*31:04.340- 31:06.020* :  The language that he uses is quite simple.
*31:06.020- 31:09.600* :  He would talk all the time about Vladimir Putin's people
*31:09.600- 31:13.220* :  as a band of crooks and thieves, that was his catchphrase.
*31:13.280- 31:17.460* :  He would also talk very much about the Russia that he envisaged.
*31:17.480- 31:20.000* :  He always called it the wonderful Russia of the future.
*31:20.000- 31:23.240* :  And he would tell his supporters that Russia could achieve that,
*31:23.280- 31:25.460* :  that Vladimir Putin could be removed from power
*31:25.460- 31:26.860* :  and that Russia could be different.
*31:26.940- 31:30.500* :  And he was unique in the sense that in Russia two years ago,
*31:30.500- 31:32.780* :  three years ago, he was the only person
*31:32.840- 31:35.480* :  who could bring crowds out onto the streets of Russia
*31:35.480- 31:38.320* :  in mass protest at a time when even then,
*31:38.320- 31:40.960* :  even before the war on Ukraine, it was dangerous.
*31:40.960- 31:41.800* :  It was risky.
*31:41.800- 31:44.720* :  So he had a drive and a passion and a charisma
*31:45.280- 31:47.340* :  that was very, very compelling for many people.
*31:47.900- 31:50.540* :  And he showed huge personal bravery, didn't he?
*31:50.540- 31:52.560* :  I mean, why do you think he took the path he did?
*31:52.900- 31:56.040* :  Why return to Russia when he must have known
*31:56.040- 31:57.700* :  he was going to be arrested?
*31:58.260- 31:59.440* :  He absolutely knew.
*31:59.440- 32:01.760* :  It was spelled out for him by the prison service
*32:01.760- 32:04.000* :  that if he went back to Russia, he would be arrested.
*32:04.000- 32:05.960* :  He knew absolutely what was coming
*32:05.960- 32:08.720* :  and he chose that path in all consciousness.
*32:08.840- 32:11.440* :  And I think that wasn't a surprise to anyone
*32:11.440- 32:12.940* :  who'd ever met Alexey Navalny.
*32:12.940- 32:15.720* :  There was no way he was going to become another politician
*32:15.880- 32:18.080* :  and emigrate politician from Russia,
*32:18.080- 32:20.680* :  becoming increasingly irrelevant and sort of detached
*32:20.680- 32:22.860* :  and isolated from the politics of the country
*32:22.860- 32:24.160* :  that he wanted to change.
*32:24.220- 32:27.040* :  So he went back to Russia because he couldn't really be
*32:27.220- 32:28.000* :  anywhere else.
*32:28.340- 32:30.320* :  And of course, he knew that he was heading for prison.
*32:30.820- 32:31.840* :  Of course, he knew the risk.
*32:31.840- 32:32.980* :  He had already been poisoned.
*32:33.060- 32:37.080* :  He knew that the Russian authorities had tried to kill him
*32:37.320- 32:39.100* :  and he absolutely knew the danger.
*32:39.100- 32:41.480* :  But I believe he didn't think he could be anywhere else.
*32:41.480- 32:43.720* :  He didn't really have the right to be anywhere else.
*32:44.100- 32:45.900* :  Sarah Rainesford on Alexey Navalny,
*32:45.980- 32:47.940* :  who's died at the age of 47.
*32:48.700- 32:51.080* :  And our sister podcast, The Global Story,
*32:51.080- 32:53.940* :  has been looking at what Mr Navalny's death means
*32:53.940- 32:56.920* :  for the future of Russia, its opposition movement
*32:56.920- 32:58.900* :  and its leader Vladimir Putin.
*32:59.540- 33:01.780* :  Gabriel Gait has speaks to Least to Set,
*33:01.780- 33:04.140* :  who we heard from earlier, Olga Ifshina
*33:04.280- 33:05.740* :  from the BBC's Russian Service
*33:06.200- 33:10.840* :  and Frances Skar, who covers Russian media for BBC Monitoring.
*33:13.460- 33:14.400* :  And that's it from us for now,
*33:14.400- 33:17.280* :  but there'll be a new edition of The Global News Podcast later.
*33:17.680- 33:19.760* :  This edition was mixed by Chris Kuzaris.
*33:19.760- 33:21.280* :  The producer was Emma Joseph.
