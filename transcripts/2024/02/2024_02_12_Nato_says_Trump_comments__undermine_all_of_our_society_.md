*01:46.660- 01:49.860* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:52.300- 01:57.260* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Monday the 12th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:57.840- 02:03.560* :  NATO's Secretary General has rebuked Donald Trump for suggesting that he'd encourage Russia
*02:04.180- 02:07.420* :  to attack any member of the alliance that hadn't paid its bills.
*02:07.740- 02:13.700* :  The US President Joe Biden has urged Israel's Prime Minister in a phone call not to launch
*02:13.740- 02:19.100* :  an offensive on Raffa without a plan to protect more than a million civilians there.
*02:19.820- 02:24.300* :  And Keeve says it has evidence that Russian troops are using Elon Musk's Starlink
*02:24.300- 02:27.720* :  satellite internet service in occupied parts of Ukraine.
*02:30.760- 02:35.460* :  Also coming up in this podcast, she's very much learnt that she needs to stand next to him
*02:35.560- 02:40.960* :  at the feedback it in order to kind of have her focus and from there she will very quickly
*02:40.960- 02:44.760* :  take the fish but she is definitely much more secure by having him next to her.
*02:45.020- 02:49.900* :  We'll tell you about squid, the partially sighted penguin that's found a friend at feeding time.
*02:53.400- 02:58.380* :  Let's start there with NATO's Secretary General who has issued a stern rebuke to Donald Trump
*02:58.920- 03:03.700* :  for suggesting that he would encourage Russia to attack members of the alliance who don't pay their
*03:03.700- 03:08.940* :  dues. Jens Stoltenberg said the words of the former US President who is running for office
*03:08.940- 03:15.520* :  a game this year could undermine security and put soldiers at risk. Mr Stoltenberg insisted
*03:15.520- 03:19.760* :  that the alliance stood by its commitment to defend any member that was attacked.
*03:20.480- 03:25.380* :  The White House has described Mr Trump's comments made at a campaign rally on Saturday
*03:25.380- 03:30.540* :  as appalling and unhinged. Here's our security correspondent Frank Gardner.
*03:30.940- 03:36.280* :  Donald Trump's comments are on the face of it shocking and destabilising. The notion of a
*03:36.280- 03:41.700* :  potential future US President encouraging Russia to attack a NATO country has prompted swift
*03:41.700- 03:46.620* :  rebukes. The White House called it appalling and unhinged. NATO Secretary General
*03:46.620- 03:50.640* :  felt obliged to issue a statement reassuring the world that nothing had changed,
*03:51.120- 03:55.240* :  that the alliance still stood by its commitment to defend all members if they were attacked.
*03:56.100- 04:00.120* :  So what exactly did the former President and now presidential hopeful say?
*04:00.900- 04:05.940* :  This was Donald Trump speaking at a rally in South Carolina addressing a favorite issue of his.
*04:05.940- 04:11.340* :  How some NATO members are failing to spend the agreed 2% of GDP on defence.
*04:11.960- 04:15.760* :  They asked me that question. One of the presidents of a big country stood up said,
*04:16.600- 04:22.040* :  well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said,
*04:22.420- 04:29.100* :  you didn't pay? You're delinquent? He said, yes, let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you.
*04:29.100- 04:33.920* :  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever they held they want. You got to pay. You got to pay
*04:33.920- 04:39.120* :  you bill. This is, of course, typical Trump fair. Say something provocative, outrage or critics,
*04:39.120- 04:44.380* :  revel in the headlines and delight your supporters. There are plenty of Americans on both sides of
*04:44.380- 04:49.740* :  the political divide who struggle to see why the US should be paying such a huge bill for NATO
*04:49.740- 04:55.600* :  when so many other members are failing to reach the required 2%. These are dangerous times for
*04:55.600- 05:00.260* :  the alliance. The Baltic states are convinced that once President Putin has achieved his war
*05:00.260- 05:05.300* :  aims in Ukraine, he will turn his attention to them. Don't, sewn by Donald Trump,
*05:05.300- 05:09.980* :  could be just enough to convince the Kremlin that a future President Trump would not
*05:09.980- 05:15.880* :  after all come to the defence of a fellow NATO member. And that is exactly what can lead
*05:15.880- 05:22.060* :  to fatal miscalculations. Frank Ardner reporting. Ukraine next, almost since it started,
*05:22.060- 05:27.260* :  the conflict in the country has been a focus for technical innovation drones in particular.
*05:27.980- 05:33.240* :  Well, another piece of technology used by Ukraine has been the Starlink system for satellite
*05:33.240- 05:39.220* :  internet connection. It's built by SpaceX, which is a company owned by the billionaire Elon Musk.
*05:39.840- 05:45.160* :  But now it's been alleged that Russian troops have been using Starlink. Something Mr. Musk
*05:45.160- 05:50.580* :  had said would not happen. So what is Starlink? That's a question I put to our Euro-Pregional
*05:50.580- 05:57.240* :  editor Paul Moss. Starlink is a system of over 5,000 satellites which are in low war, but they
*05:57.240- 06:02.560* :  were sent up there to provide internet access to places which previously couldn't get it. It's
*06:02.560- 06:08.100* :  quite simple. The signals beamed up from your computer or your mobile phone up to the satellite and
*06:08.100- 06:13.160* :  then bounced to an internet service provider. This of course is very useful for countries which
*06:13.160- 06:18.620* :  don't have much in the way of internet infrastructure, no broadband pipes perhaps. But also it could
*06:18.620- 06:22.660* :  be useful in a technically advanced country like the United States where there are rural areas
*06:22.660- 06:27.860* :  places in the middle of nowhere where they don't have the internet. It was launched in 2019 and
*06:28.280- 06:32.960* :  so far as proof rather successful it has over two million subscribers, a turnover of more than
*06:32.960- 06:38.540* :  a billion dollars. And Elon Musk who runs the company says that it's already making a slight
*06:38.540- 06:42.960* :  profit. Now as I'm sitting here listening I recall that sometimes you can actually look up and see
*06:42.960- 06:48.060* :  a string of the Starlink satellites in the sky on a clear night, can't you? But how has that
*06:48.060- 06:53.840* :  become part of the Ukraine war? Once the war started Russia made a b-line for attacking Ukraine's
*06:53.840- 06:59.520* :  infrastructure gas electricity but also the internet. So Ukraine asked Elon Musk can you
*06:59.960- 07:05.060* :  allow us to use Starlink so we can still have the internet? At first he did so as a gift he gave
*07:05.060- 07:10.720* :  out free subscriptions and free equipment. Later the US Defense Department agreed to fork out the
*07:10.720- 07:16.440* :  money to keep Starlink going in Ukraine. And it has been very useful for civilians but also for
*07:16.440- 07:22.140* :  the military we know that during the battles of Mario Pol and as off-staff for example the troops
*07:22.140- 07:28.760* :  kept in contact using Starlink but it's supposed to be for only one side you can't buy Starlink
*07:28.760- 07:33.540* :  equipment in Russia and even if you could the satellites don't cover Russia so they wouldn't work
*07:33.540- 07:39.620* :  but we've recently seen allegations that Russian soldiers have been using Starlink in Ukrainian
*07:39.620- 07:45.180* :  territory they occupy and on Sunday the Ukrainian intelligence agency said they've got proof of
*07:45.180- 07:50.080* :  this they intercepted a call between two soldiers who said they'd been using this equipment they
*07:50.080- 07:54.960* :  could have either taken it from captured Ukrainian soldiers or bought it via a third country.
*07:55.220- 08:00.940* :  And Elon Musk who I think control Starlink because he controls SpaceX which started Starlink what
*08:00.940- 08:05.600* :  does he have to say about these allegations? Well it's interesting because SpaceX have continued
*08:05.600- 08:10.740* :  to deny that Starlink is available in Russia but they haven't said whether it works in
*08:10.740- 08:16.600* :  Russia occupied Ukraine and it's possible that non-denial speaks volumes I should say that Starlink
*08:16.600- 08:21.260* :  has been controversial from the start you mentioned those lights in the sky astronomers claimed
*08:21.260- 08:26.760* :  it would cause light pollution and then after Israel wiped out the internet in Gaza at one point
*08:26.760- 08:32.360* :  people asked if Starlink would be provided to Gaza to replace it and Elon Musk said he would
*08:32.360- 08:37.520* :  only do it if the Israelis agreed now I have to say this is a man who is to say the least no
*08:37.520- 08:43.300* :  stranger to controversy it's unlikely that this latest controversy with Ukraine is really going
*08:43.300- 08:49.300* :  to bother him. Paul Moss Finland's conservative former prime minister Alexander Stube has won the
*08:49.300- 08:55.580* :  country's presidential election as we record this podcast with most of the votes counted his
*08:55.580- 09:01.420* :  green party rival the former foreign minister Pika Havisto has admitted defeat Histie Jackson.
*09:01.860- 09:07.280* :  This is the first presidential poll since Finland joined NATO last year Mr. Stube is a strong
*09:07.280- 09:12.580* :  supporter of Ukraine and has taken a hard line approach towards Russia with which Finland shares
*09:12.580- 09:18.800* :  a 1,300 kilometer border. This matters because the finish head of state is directly responsible for
*09:18.800- 09:23.240* :  foreign and security policy and is commander in chief of the country's armed forces.
*09:24.040- 09:29.060* :  The outgoing president Sauli Ninisto who is stepping down was at one point given the nickname
*09:29.060- 09:34.400* :  the Putin Whisperer because of his relationship with the Russian leader and the softer stance he
*09:34.400- 09:41.200* :  took towards Moscow. Next to Gaza the US president Joe Biden has spoken by telephone to
*09:41.200- 09:47.240* :  Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time since he described Israel's
*09:47.240- 09:53.920* :  military response in Gaza as quote over the top. The White House says Mr. Biden reiterated that
*09:53.920- 09:59.740* :  Israel shouldn't proceed with an offensive in the city of Ruffa without plans to ensure the
*09:59.740- 10:05.860* :  safety of over a million civilians there. Aid agencies have warned that an assault on Ruffa
*10:05.860- 10:11.940* :  would be catastrophic. The city in southern Gaza is now home to many Palestinians who were told
*10:11.940- 10:17.580* :  to flee to the area since the fighting started last October. Israel's prime minister has said
*10:17.580- 10:23.460* :  though he's determined to launch the offensive into Ruffa but is making plans for the evacuation
*10:23.460- 10:29.380* :  of civilians. Speaking to ABC television in the United States, Benjamin Netanyahu said he would
*10:29.380- 10:35.620* :  ensure safe passage for the civilian population to leave. Victory is within reach. We're going to do
*10:35.620- 10:42.100* :  it. We're going to get the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions in Ruffa which is the last bastion
*10:42.100- 10:46.600* :  but we're going to do it and in this I agree with the Americans. We're going to do it while providing
*10:46.600- 10:52.780* :  safe passage for the civilian population so they can leave. For many people though the situation
*10:52.780- 10:59.960* :  in the south of Gaza is now extremely difficult. Tom White, who is a director of the UN
*10:59.960- 11:06.680* :  Agency in Gaza, Unrah, explained how difficult it would be to move Palestinian refugees sheltering
*11:06.680- 11:13.320* :  in Ruffa. The only really what we can see feasible access out of the city will probably be along
*11:13.320- 11:20.800* :  the coast road and try to move a million people and a humanitarian operation up a country road
*11:20.800- 11:26.760* :  is just not going to be feasible. The conditions in Ruffa haven't improved. Essentially you've
*11:26.760- 11:34.640* :  got a town that used to have 280,000 people living in it. Now around 1.4 million people are living
*11:34.640- 11:39.740* :  in Ruffa. People don't have enough water. There's a lack of access to sanitation. We're starting
*11:39.740- 11:47.580* :  to get enough food to people but living conditions are very tough. For more on that call I spoke to
*11:47.580- 11:52.920* :  our correspondent Will Vernon who's in Washington DC and he told us that the White House has made it
*11:52.920- 11:58.840* :  clear there would not support a military operation without a plan for civilian safety. We know that
*11:58.840- 12:04.320* :  President Biden did reaffirm his view that an Israeli military operation in the city of Ruffa,
*12:04.320- 12:09.420* :  this is where hundreds of thousands over a million Palestinian civilians are sheltering that
*12:09.420- 12:15.320* :  that should not go ahead without proper planning to ensure that the civilians sheltering there
*12:15.320- 12:20.780* :  are not harmed. Now Washington has been warning for a number of days that going into Ruffa unprepared
*12:20.780- 12:26.080* :  would be a disaster. The UN has said this as well. Aid agencies have said it would be a catastrophe
*12:26.140- 12:33.460* :  and Mr Biden said that again today to Mr Netanyahu on the call and generally Mr Biden has been
*12:33.460- 12:39.400* :  kind of slowly ramping up his rhetoric over the last few weeks when talking about the Israeli
*12:39.400- 12:45.600* :  military operation. On Thursday President Biden said that that offensive was over the top
*12:45.600- 12:51.400* :  which is his harshest criticism yet. Really of his Israeli ally. Can I talk to you about domestic
*12:51.400- 12:56.660* :  politics on the US side as the election cycle really takes hold? How much of an issue or perhaps a
*12:56.660- 13:02.920* :  better way of saying it is how much pressure is President Biden facing because of his ongoing
*13:02.920- 13:08.440* :  and resolute support for what Israel's government is doing? I think the President Biden's under
*13:08.440- 13:13.580* :  huge pressure over this issue. This has made all the more complicated by the fact that it is
*13:13.580- 13:20.060* :  an election year here, a particularly closely thought polarized election campaign, at least at
*13:20.060- 13:25.560* :  shaping up to be that way. President Biden has been criticized by Republicans who some of whom say
*13:25.560- 13:31.340* :  that he's not going far enough in his support of Israel but most importantly he's come under attack
*13:31.340- 13:36.720* :  both from progressives within his own party saying that the US should be putting more pressure
*13:36.720- 13:43.420* :  on Israel to reduce the impact on civilians in Gaza. But also amongst key groups of voters,
*13:43.420- 13:48.760* :  right? For example, there is the US state of Michigan that is a key swing state, one of the states
*13:48.760- 13:54.600* :  that Mr. Biden has to win if he has any hope of staying in the White House come November and in
*13:54.600- 14:01.580* :  Michigan there are large groups of Arab Americans. So their votes will be key in determining the
*14:01.580- 14:07.020* :  US presidential election and there's no greater prize than that. Well Vernon, in Washington, D.C.,
*14:07.020- 14:13.040* :  well let's stay with our reporting of the war between Israel and Hamas because Gada Uda is a
*14:13.040- 14:19.440* :  translator and freelance journalist who's from Gaza. She lived in Gaza City until the fighting forced
*14:19.440- 14:25.980* :  her to move south, first to Khan units and now to Rafa. My colleague James Menendez asked her what
*14:25.980- 14:31.420* :  the situation there is like at the moment. Well more than one million and a half Palestinians
*14:31.580- 14:40.120* :  believe to be in Rafa now. Actually we can hear some airstrikes, maybe they are east of Rafa or maybe
*14:40.120- 14:48.900* :  between areas between Khan units and Rafa. It can be heard like every hour and people,
*14:48.900- 14:55.060* :  you know, they are so scared like they have to evacuate for many many times and this is the
*14:55.060- 15:02.880* :  last stage so the situation here is so horrible. And what do people think about the idea of having
*15:02.880- 15:07.680* :  to move again because many people who, as I understand it, who are living in Rafa have already
*15:07.680- 15:13.900* :  had to move from other places including Gaza City? Yeah people actually start to flee to
*15:14.400- 15:20.120* :  areas west of Hanyun which is being considered as a safe place. Actually they start to live
*15:20.120- 15:26.300* :  today, some of them. Right so people are waiting to find out when that military offensive will
*15:26.300- 15:30.500* :  begin. They're just leaving already. Yeah because Israeli army they have
*15:30.500- 15:37.020* :  acquitted that they will do some ground invasion here to this area so people are
*15:37.120- 15:43.320* :  preparing themselves to flee, taking some of their essential with them. It's a
*15:43.320- 15:47.800* :  getting through to people in Rafa at the moment. I mean if people got enough to eat, for example.
*15:48.140- 15:54.780* :  Yeah actually Rafa crossing is all been and people can have some humanitarian aid
*15:54.780- 16:02.120* :  from the crossing so still they have good sublimant like food, like water, at least it's
*16:02.120- 16:07.980* :  enough but not like the north area. And where are you living at the moment? Are you staying with
*16:07.980- 16:14.920* :  family with friends? Yeah I've been like in Hanyun for three months and now I'm moving like since
*16:15.020- 16:23.420* :  three weeks to my relatives home in Rafa. So I'm staying with three families and we are more
*16:23.420- 16:28.500* :  than 20 people inside one home. Right and it's but it's a proper apartment is it? It's not a tent.
*16:28.540- 16:34.500* :  Yes yes. And what about you? I mean you're from Gaza City and that's where you normally live. Do
*16:34.500- 16:39.600* :  you know what's happened to your to your home there? I mean is it still there? Well it's an east
*16:40.080- 16:46.440* :  off of Jabalia actually in my home and it was targeted. Last news we've been hearing from
*16:46.440- 16:52.580* :  friends over there. It was partially destroyed and all the area have been destroyed.
*16:53.520- 17:00.780* :  My other sister houses, my cousins, my uncles, all of their houses have been destroyed.
*17:01.760- 17:06.460* :  Well that was Garda Uda originally from Gaza City but now living in Rafa.
*17:07.480- 17:12.960* :  Change of pace now. Io Capitano is one of the five films nominated for best international
*17:12.960- 17:18.560* :  feature film at the Oscars next month. It's the story of what happens to two teenagers after
*17:18.560- 17:24.620* :  they leave home in Senegal hoping to migrate to Italy. Vincent Dowd spoke to the films director and
*17:24.620- 17:30.140* :  to one of the people who inspired the movie. My name is Matteo Garrone and I'm the director of
*17:30.140- 17:36.260* :  Io Capitano. I am Mama Ducuasi, one of the protagonists of the film Io Capitano.
*17:44.540- 17:51.260* :  Matteo Garrone is one of Italy's best known directors for among other hits the crime drama
*17:51.260- 17:58.700* :  Gamora. He says Io Capitano can be enjoyed as an adventure story about how a Senegalese teenager
*17:58.700- 18:05.200* :  pilot say boat full of migrants across the Mediterranean but he has political points to make
*18:05.200- 18:12.920* :  two. I decided to make this movie because we wanted to give visual form to a part of a journey
*18:12.920- 18:18.840* :  that we usually don't see. We see only the last part on television when the boat arrived in
*18:18.860- 18:23.720* :  Sicily and the count of the people alive and dead and we don't know what happened before.
*18:28.680- 18:34.480* :  Mamero Garrone who now lives near Naples provided much of the inspiration for the film with the
*18:34.480- 18:40.720* :  real life journey he made about 15 years ago. This movie is telling about my story from the
*18:40.760- 18:47.500* :  beginning that me and my cousin we decided to live from Africa to Europe crossing the Mediterranean
*18:47.660- 18:56.320* :  I thought that in the desert people are dying dead bodies on the desert and we we face people
*18:56.320- 19:02.860* :  that rob us we have been maltreated tortures in everyday in the prison in Libya and we have
*19:02.860- 19:11.540* :  been even been sold like slaves there. The journey from Senegal to the coast of Sicily at times
*19:11.540- 19:19.120* :  looks beautiful despite its rigors but scenes in a sadisticly run prison in Libya show the hero
*19:19.120- 19:27.040* :  Moussa quickly abandoning his naivety. It's a coming-of-age story so it's a boy that started as a
*19:27.040- 19:33.480* :  boy and during this odyssey he became a man. What's the enemy in the film? Well it's quite evident
*19:33.500- 19:40.900* :  the movie talks about the desire of this two young boy to discover the world in a system
*19:40.900- 19:48.600* :  of people that try to exploit them so the main character is a contemporary hero that fight
*19:49.140- 19:56.220* :  for a rice that should be of everyone the rights of move the rights of desire to look for a better
*19:56.220- 20:10.560* :  life it's a battle against a system of death. The language is mainly wall of the two young
*20:10.560- 20:18.520* :  actors are likable but Mamadou Kwasi knows real-life stories like his are controversial for many
*20:18.520- 20:25.520* :  Italians. The Italian Prime Minister Georgia Malone has described immigration as a battle for
*20:25.520- 20:30.520* :  Italy and Europe. You've made a very good film but the politicians of the people who have to
*20:30.520- 20:38.000* :  sort out a really difficult problem so how do you think your film at least is a contribution to that?
*20:38.140- 20:44.800* :  This film is an instrument to change the policy giving chance to people to travel free give freedom
*20:44.800- 20:50.480* :  to people to travel because this will also will help people to avoid trafficking in the desert
*20:50.480- 21:04.340* :  in the Mediterranean Sea and also in the prison. The films now up for an Academy Award Matiogoroni
*21:04.340- 21:11.160* :  says win or not he hopes it will change the perspectives of the young in particular. In Italy we have
*21:11.160- 21:17.640* :  green the movie too many many school too many students so it's also an opportunity for the young
*21:17.640- 21:24.280* :  that don't go to see the movie in theater to realize behind the stumber there are kids like them.
*21:25.260- 21:30.260* :  Matiogoroni director of the film Eo Capitano ending that report by Vincent Down.
*21:32.400- 21:39.920* :  Still to come. We have a stretch of course line of approximately 15 kilometers that's impacted.

*22:02.360- 22:09.720* :  when he was the biggest star in all the world but something happened not just to him but to hundreds

*23:48.460- 23:54.560* :  That was the sound of some demonstrations outside an election commission office in Karachi on Sunday.
*23:55.080- 24:00.740* :  Supporters of the former Pakistani Prime Minister in Rancan were protesting about delays in the
*24:00.740- 24:06.960* :  declaration of results from last Thursday's election. They allege vote rigging. The police have
*24:06.960- 24:13.160* :  warned against unlawful assemblies or demonstrations around government offices. Pakistan now faces
*24:13.160- 24:19.740* :  further political uncertainty as coalition negotiations continue. There was no outright winner in
*24:19.740- 24:25.280* :  the vote candidates who support Mr Khan who was jailed in the run up to the election emerged
*24:25.280- 24:32.920* :  with the most seats 93 out of the 264 available. I heard from our correspondent in Islamabad,
*24:32.920- 24:38.760* :  Caroline Davies. The protest that we went over to today was relatively small so we're not seeing
*24:39.420- 24:43.660* :  mass enormous demonstrations happening across the whole of Pakistan. But we are seeing
*24:43.660- 24:49.700* :  these small demonstrations that are coming out in some of the cities, a few hundred people at each of
*24:49.700- 24:55.400* :  them. But clearly those are also not being tolerated by the police we've seen or today when I was in
*24:55.400- 25:00.660* :  Ralph Indy outside the election commission where some of them around Karachi supporters arrived
*25:00.660- 25:06.480* :  and were protesting again a few hundred. After about an hour and a half they were dispersed with
*25:06.480- 25:12.520* :  tear gas. So they're clearly not being tolerated being able to gather. But I think what we're
*25:12.520- 25:18.300* :  also seeing is a gathering of resentment that's building on social media as well. And what will be
*25:18.300- 25:23.340* :  really interesting is whether or not that spills over as things develop in the course of the next
*25:23.680- 25:30.640* :  few days. And following on from that long delay about declaring the results. Is there any sense
*25:30.640- 25:38.360* :  of suspicion and a doubt about the results and if so how widespread is that? Yes I think the fact
*25:38.360- 25:44.220* :  there was such a delay has left this space for people to make more and more accusations that they
*25:44.220- 25:48.600* :  think that this was essentially in their words a fixed match that people knew what the results were
*25:48.600- 25:52.600* :  going to be and they don't trust the results. And obviously the authorities have come back and said
*25:52.600- 25:57.380* :  that's not true but I think that that is going to be a real issue here because I think that is
*25:57.380- 26:02.500* :  a narrative that a lot of people are talking about. The fact that the powerful Pakistan military has
*26:02.500- 26:06.480* :  often been involved or seem to be involved in politics despite the fact that they say they're not
*26:06.480- 26:11.520* :  in the political parties that are perceived to be their favored candidates always say that they've
*26:11.520- 26:16.400* :  not done a deal with them. That's always generally been what people think has happened when they see
*26:16.400- 26:22.660* :  an election. Now the fact that we are now seeing this delay the fact that that's also the backdrop
*26:22.660- 26:28.480* :  people are talking about it and talking about it fairly openly as well. And the political machinations
*26:28.480- 26:32.700* :  I understand negotiations are now underway involving you know former prime minister who's in jail
*26:32.700- 26:38.340* :  so he doesn't have any personal role to play. Lots of parties with acronyms. I mean what's going on
*26:38.340- 26:42.480* :  in terms of the next hours, the next few days, the next week or so in terms of what the outcome
*26:42.480- 26:46.580* :  possibly could be. The biggest development that we've seen this evening is the fact that we've had
*26:46.580- 26:51.580* :  confirmation that senior leadership from Nawaz Sharif's party have met senior leadership from
*26:51.620- 26:57.440* :  Bilawal Bhutto's party. He is the son of assassinated Benazir Bhutto the former prime minister here
*26:57.440- 27:03.300* :  in Pakistan. Those two parties have had their senior leadership meet to discuss the potential
*27:03.300- 27:07.960* :  of forming a government. And those are now formal talks. There was video put out earlier
*27:07.960- 27:12.720* :  of the two sides greeting each other incredibly warmly. Now this wouldn't be entirely new for these
*27:12.720- 27:18.220* :  parties because they were previously in a coalition government after they ousted in Rancan from
*27:18.220- 27:24.940* :  power and they then ruled the country as a coalition up until August last year. So that might
*27:24.940- 27:28.880* :  be something that we see developing. They haven't announced that they are forming a government,
*27:28.880- 27:34.220* :  but the fact that they are publicly meeting and as I say, warmly welcoming each other is being seen
*27:34.220- 27:40.680* :  as very significant here. Caroline Davis in Pakistan. The United Nations Children's Agency UNICEF
*27:40.680- 27:47.320* :  has warned that nearly 70,000 children in Western Nepal need further humanitarian aid following
*27:47.320- 27:53.500* :  November's devastating earthquake. Molly Parella has more. The appeal from UNICEF comes 100 days on
*27:53.500- 27:58.760* :  from what was Nepal's deadliest earthquake in eight years. Many people have spent the harsh winter
*27:58.760- 28:03.640* :  in makeshift shelters. The agency warned that young people were still dealing with the trauma
*28:03.640- 28:08.320* :  of losing loved ones. It said their development was at risk because they had lost their belongings
*28:08.320- 28:13.920* :  and their homes and schools had been damaged. UNICEF said children needed normalcy so they could
*28:13.920- 28:19.300* :  begin to heal. It's appealing for more than 14 million dollars in funding to help rebuild the
*28:19.300- 28:25.860* :  lives of those affected. Molly Parella. Now, in an earlier podcast, we reported on the news from
*28:25.860- 28:30.920* :  Trinidad and Tobago that hundreds of volunteers there have been helping efforts to clean up a huge
*28:30.920- 28:38.020* :  oil spill caused by a ship that overturned after hitting a coral reef. The oil has affected 15
*28:38.020- 28:43.940* :  kilometres of the coastline, damaging beaches and reaching a protected mangrove swamp. It should
*28:43.940- 28:48.580* :  be the time of year when many tourists visit the islands to enjoy the sunshine and the clear blue
*28:49.100- 28:54.180* :  waters. Well, my colleague James Menendez spoke to Farley Augustine, Tobago's chief secretary,
*28:54.180- 28:57.900* :  the head of its government, and started by asking how serious is the spill?
*28:58.220- 29:06.500* :  We have a stretch of coastline of approximately 15 kilometres that's impacted. We pull the
*29:06.500- 29:14.360* :  Sentinel maps and we have recognised that the leakage started some 12 kilometres away from
*29:14.360- 29:23.160* :  vessel's resting point. We have been into one lagoon that is seriously affected. We are seeing
*29:23.160- 29:29.400* :  the oil slick along the roots of the mangrove, notwithstanding we are seeing signs of resilience.
*29:30.180- 29:37.920* :  And we also have specialists with wildlife rehabilitation in the area, but we have not had any
*29:37.920- 29:42.200* :  major impact on wildlife just as yet.
*29:42.420- 29:46.540* :  The pictures are pretty alarming, thick, crude washing up on those beaches. Are you going to be
*29:46.540- 29:52.600* :  able to clean it up, do you think? Absolutely. In fact, we have one of the areas most impacted with
*29:52.600- 29:59.600* :  the majority of the crude gone and the rocks still blackened, but we retreated to the rocks with
*29:59.600- 30:05.240* :  the use of a specialist and environmentalist. In fact, what we deployed this morning is the use
*30:05.240- 30:13.440* :  of these vacuum tanker trucks. These trucks have the capacity to suction out the seaweedless
*30:13.440- 30:20.220* :  algorithm mixed with the oil-like substance and remove it from the beach. We have schemas in the water
*30:20.780- 30:25.440* :  that separating the oil particles from the water and removing the oil particles.
*30:25.840- 30:29.560* :  But this shouldn't have happened in the first place. Do you know why the ship was abandoned
*30:29.560- 30:34.220* :  and in fact who owns the ship? That's the biggest challenge that we face at the moment,
*30:34.240- 30:41.160* :  because the area where I am one number is usually located, that area is covered with the oil-like
*30:41.160- 30:46.880* :  substance. Is that an identification number that helps you trace the owner? Correct. That can give you
*30:46.880- 30:52.660* :  some things that we have learned. So one, we have discovered that the ship has attached to it,
*30:52.880- 31:00.040* :  a cable, which is about a third the length of the vessel, which suggests that that vessel was
*31:00.040- 31:06.260* :  being towed. The anchor for that vessel is intact, so we know that the vessel did not breach its
*31:06.320- 31:12.340* :  anchor. So the theory we are working on is that there is a possibility that the vessel was being
*31:12.340- 31:18.900* :  towed by somebody somewhere. It's probably broke from its cable or running some kind of difficulty
*31:18.900- 31:27.400* :  and it was abandoned. I can also tell you that we are expected by Tuesday representatives of the
*31:27.420- 31:34.240* :  oil spill response limited. We being a member, we are getting five of the best international
*31:34.240- 31:40.440* :  experts when it comes to looking at salvaging and also looking at extracting oil from
*31:40.440- 31:45.820* :  sunken vessels. But it is pretty outrageous that this was allowed to happen, endangering a series
*31:45.820- 31:52.480* :  of beaches, wildlife and at a time when, presumably, you've got lots of visitors coming to the island,
*31:52.780- 31:58.900* :  isn't it? I can tell you, it's not only the carnival, just a stone throw away from one of the
*31:58.900- 32:04.180* :  cleanup sites. We have a cruise ship in the harbor in Scarborough with over 3,000 passengers.
*32:04.720- 32:10.840* :  So naturally, as an island, as a government, we are all incentivized and we are insistent on finding
*32:10.840- 32:17.620* :  out what has happened, who owned this vessel, because they must be made to take responsibility
*32:17.660- 32:23.800* :  for what has transpired. And so we are really going at this with all the resources that we have.
*32:24.580- 32:31.200* :  Folly Austin. Now let's end on camaraderie in the avian world, a story about one little penguin
*32:31.200- 32:37.060* :  helping out another. A partially sighted penguin at a bird park here in the south of England has
*32:37.060- 32:43.620* :  found a so-called guide bird to help out at feeding time. Squid, an African penguin, developed
*32:43.620- 32:49.260* :  cataracts as a chick and needs help when she gets disorientated at feeding time. She gets
*32:49.260- 32:54.800* :  steered around by another penguin who is just known simply as penguin. That's because he wasn't
*32:54.800- 33:00.200* :  given a name at birth because it was thought he wouldn't survive. Polly Bramman from Birdworld
*33:00.220- 33:05.620* :  says the pair have learned a lot from each other. They've developed this relationship from really
*33:05.620- 33:10.720* :  quite a young age when they both were learning about life in the colony, penguin because he had been
*33:10.720- 33:15.500* :  hand-reared after being very sick and learning how to be a penguin that he hadn't grown up with
*33:15.820- 33:21.820* :  and squid because she hatched in the nest, she was rid by the parents, but with her sickness and her
*33:21.820- 33:26.780* :  partially sightedness she had to learn the beach in a very different way and they just teamed up
*33:26.820- 33:31.760* :  and they've been teamed up to ever since. She's very much learnt that she needs to stand next to him
*33:31.860- 33:37.640* :  at the feed bucket in order to kind of have her focus and from there she will very quickly take
*33:37.640- 33:42.580* :  the fish but she is definitely much more secure by having him next to her. They're not yet mature,
*33:43.120- 33:49.420* :  penguins do tend to pair for life whether they will become a pair themselves will be interesting to
*33:49.420- 33:54.640* :  see they're compatible as friends but penguins will have friendships as well so we will have to see
*33:54.640- 34:01.160* :  if they form bonds with other penguins as pairs that could impact this particular friendship but
*34:01.160- 34:05.640* :  we don't know we haven't we haven't had the like before. Polly Bramman on the friendship between
*34:05.640- 34:12.720* :  penguin and squid. Okay that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global
