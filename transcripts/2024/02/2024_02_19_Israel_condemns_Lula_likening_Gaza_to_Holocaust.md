*01:08.160- 01:10.780* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:13.400- 01:18.180* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Monday the 19th of February, these are our main stories.
*01:18.220- 01:24.780* :  Israel has condemned comments by Brazil's president accusing it of genocide in Gaza and
*01:24.780- 01:30.380* :  likening its actions to those of Hitler. The US ambassador to Moscow has laid flowers to honour
*01:30.380- 01:35.420* :  Alexei Navalny, president who tithened his most prominent Russian opponent who died in prison
*01:35.420- 01:40.900* :  on Friday. Italy's highest court has ruled that it's illegal to send migrants who've arrived by
*01:40.900- 01:50.640* :  sea back to Libya. Also in this podcast. I came to those calculations. We thought we might
*01:50.640- 01:57.860* :  start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. But out there, I'm completely dead.
*01:59.120- 02:03.700* :  The annual BAFTA Film Awards in London have been dominated by the movie Oppenheimer,
*02:04.100- 02:08.700* :  which has picked up seven prizes, including best film, best director and best actor.
*02:12.060- 02:17.240* :  We start with the conflict in Gaza and there are growing numbers of nations who've expressed
*02:17.240- 02:22.520* :  criticism at the way Israel is carrying out its attacks and the escalating number of Palestinians
*02:22.520- 02:28.080* :  being killed. Last month, South Africa filed a genocide case against Israel at the International
*02:28.080- 02:32.620* :  Court of Justice. And now the Brazilian president, Luis Ignacio Lula de Silva,
*02:32.620- 02:38.480* :  speaking in Ethiopia at the African Union Summit, has taken the criticism to a new level.
*02:38.740- 02:43.700* :  He likened Israel's operations in Gaza to the actions of Adolf Hitler during the Holocaust.
*02:47.600- 02:52.540* :  What's happening in the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian people has no paralleling history.
*02:53.300- 02:57.260* :  In fact, it did happen when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.
*02:58.180- 03:02.740* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Brazilian leader had crossed a red line.
*03:03.200- 03:08.780* :  By comparing Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas, a general-sidal terrorist organization
*03:09.560- 03:15.200* :  to the Holocaust, President Silva has disclosed the memory of six million Jews murdered by the Nazis
*03:15.680- 03:21.300* :  and has demonized the Jewish state like the most virulent anti-Semite he should be ashamed of
*03:22.160- 03:26.500* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, and asked him what has been the general
*03:26.500- 03:33.460* :  reaction to the Brazilian president's comments in Israel? As you would imagine, Israelis are outraged
*03:33.500- 03:40.600* :  at any suggestion that what they are doing in Gaza bears any resemblance at all to the murder of
*03:40.600- 03:46.480* :  six million Jews by the Nazis in World War Two. You know, it is a pretty extraordinary comparison.
*03:46.940- 03:54.360* :  And so it is not at all surprising that from the president on down we are hearing expressions
*03:54.360- 03:59.420* :  of total outrage. You have already mentioned the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*03:59.420- 04:07.040* :  the president Isaac Herzog reminded people that they had found in Gaza a book published by Hamas
*04:07.040- 04:14.040* :  which praised and glorified Hitler's ideology in the Holocaust and he said that it was a moral
*04:14.040- 04:19.260* :  distortion of history to compare what Israel is doing to the Nazis. There were similar comments
*04:19.260- 04:25.040* :  from the Defense Minister Yoav Galant and the Brazilian ambassador is likely to be summoned
*04:25.640- 04:31.680* :  to the foreign ministry to explain himself. So I think from across the board there is a sense
*04:31.680- 04:38.420* :  of complete outrage because Israel simply does not accept any suggestion that what it is doing
*04:38.420- 04:43.820* :  in the Gaza Strip that could be remotely compared to the actions of the Nazis.
*04:44.540- 04:48.580* :  Meanwhile Paul, the Israeli government has been giving details about when it might launch
*04:48.580- 04:54.700* :  its offensive in Rafa. What do we know? Yes, so this is a speech that was given today to a
*04:54.700- 04:59.040* :  delegation of visiting presidents of major Jewish organizations from the United States.
*04:59.040- 05:04.900* :  Then he gants who is a member of the war cabinet and a former chief of staff of the army saying
*05:04.900- 05:10.580* :  that if hostages are not freed by the beginning of Ramadan, which is in precisely three weeks,
*05:10.620- 05:17.240* :  Israel will launch its offensive against the city of Rafa. The fighting he said would continue
*05:17.240- 05:22.720* :  everywhere and include the Rafa area. He went on to say that Israel would act in a coordinated
*05:22.720- 05:28.120* :  manner, facilitating his words, the evacuation of civilians in dialogue with our American
*05:28.120- 05:34.480* :  and Egyptian partners, words which may add to the speculation that some people, some Palestinians
*05:34.480- 05:40.200* :  in Gaza may find themselves having to seek refuge outside the Gaza Strip, possibly in this
*05:40.500- 05:45.440* :  walled enclosure that the Egyptians are building nearby on their side of the border.
*05:45.760- 05:50.980* :  This is obviously tough rhetoric designed to concentrate minds and to send a stark warning
*05:50.980- 05:58.080* :  to Hamas that the full might of the Israeli military is going to be turned on Rafa within a
*05:58.080- 06:03.140* :  matter of weeks if hostages are not released. So it could be part of a bargaining effort to try and
*06:03.140- 06:10.060* :  force a deal on the release of hostages or it could be a genuine warning that this offensive
*06:10.060- 06:17.080* :  is coming and that Hamas should know that. And most Israeli politicians and military figures
*06:17.400- 06:20.900* :  are on the same page here. They all say this is an assault which will happen.
*06:21.700- 06:26.760* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Let's go back for a moment to look at President Lulus comments
*06:26.760- 06:32.120* :  about Israel's actions in Gaza. He's our America's regional editor, they're not a Russia.
*06:33.020- 06:37.560* :  While most people will condemn President Lulus' reference to Hitler in the context of the Gaza
*06:37.560- 06:43.740* :  conflict, his criticism of Israeli policies towards the Palestinians reflects the prevailing views
*06:43.740- 06:49.520* :  of the left in Latin America. The political polarization of the past decade has pushed the left
*06:49.520- 06:55.020* :  and the right to opposing sides on most foreign policy issues, from climate change and migration
*06:55.020- 07:01.900* :  to war. Like the leaders of Venezuela, Nicaragua and Colombia, Mr. Lula was criticized for failing
*07:01.900- 07:08.460* :  to condemn in strong terms Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said at a time that both sides were
*07:08.460- 07:14.120* :  keen to fight and added that it takes two to tangle. A dissonant left-wing voice in the region
*07:14.120- 07:19.780* :  has been that of Gabriel Borridge, the 38 year old president of Chile. He has used strong
*07:19.780- 07:25.120* :  words against Hamas and Israel and has also criticized the leaders of Russia and Nicaragua.
*07:25.540- 07:30.780* :  Mr. Borridge has urged Latin American leaders to speak out against the violation of human rights
*07:30.780- 07:37.340* :  in international law wherever it happens. Leonardo Russia. The American ambassador to Moscow
*07:37.340- 07:43.240* :  has laid flowers to honor Alexei Navalny, the prominent Russian opposition leader who died in a
*07:43.240- 07:48.720* :  Siberian jail on Friday. The Russian prison service announced his death saying that he'd
*07:48.720- 07:54.220* :  collapsed after taking a walk. Mr. Navalny's supporters believe he was murdered. Our Eastern
*07:54.220- 08:01.160* :  European correspondent Sarah Rainesford reports. Russia doesn't want acts of commemoration for Alexei
*08:01.160- 08:07.520* :  Navalny to become acts of protest. So since he died, police have arrested dozens of people across
*08:07.520- 08:13.460* :  the country, including a priest who wanted to lead a press service. Men in black hoods keep
*08:13.460- 08:19.420* :  clearing away the flowers so that the scale of support for Navalny isn't obvious. But in Moscow,
*08:19.420- 08:25.340* :  there are fresh flowers and more people, pausing to remember a man who campaigned against corruption
*08:25.340- 08:34.400* :  against the Kremlin and for change and who was imprisoned for that. This woman described
*08:34.400- 08:39.360* :  Navalny as a hero. She says he fought for Russia to be free and not a dictatorship.
*08:43.640- 08:48.160* :  Another says he opened her eyes to what Russia is and to what it's doing in Ukraine.
*08:49.360- 08:54.620* :  It was put denouncing the invasion of Ukraine that another opposition figure Vladimir Karawaza
*08:54.620- 09:00.960* :  was imprisoned. Today, his wife Yevgeniy told the BBC that in her view, Vladimir Putin has been
*09:00.960- 09:07.620* :  left unchecked for too long. All that impunity that lost it for decades led him to believe that he's
*09:07.620- 09:13.900* :  somehow untouchable. And for as long as he's sitting in the Kremlin unchecked, we will see more
*09:14.060- 09:20.420* :  monging, we will see more repression. Navalny's body still hasn't been released to his family.
*09:20.420- 09:25.540* :  There is still no information on the cause of his sudden death, so his political
*09:25.540- 09:30.920* :  team are accusing the authorities of a cover-up. They don't trust them, especially since he was
*09:30.920- 09:36.760* :  poisoned with a nerve agent three years ago. Navalny always said he was fighting for what he called
*09:36.760- 09:42.500* :  the beautiful Russia of the future. As one of his aides put it today, he just wanted a country
*09:42.500- 09:49.540* :  that was normal. Sarah Reinsford. Italy's top court has ruled that sending migrants to arrive
*09:49.540- 09:55.820* :  by sea back to Libya is unlawful. More than 80 migrants have been saved following two sea
*09:55.820- 10:00.060* :  rescues in the Mediterranean over the last 24 hours. Alice Adely reports.
*10:00.820- 10:05.200* :  The court's decision to uphold the conviction of the unnamed captain of an Italian
*10:05.200- 10:12.740* :  tobo to the Asso 28 is final. In 2018 he picked up 101 people, including children and pregnant
*10:12.740- 10:18.560* :  women from a rubber dinghy in the Mediterranean and returned them to Libya. widespread migrant
*10:18.560- 10:24.360* :  abuse has been extensively documented in Libya. In recent years Italy and other European
*10:24.360- 10:29.720* :  governments have taken an increasingly hard line on immigration amid a swell in support for
*10:29.720- 10:35.700* :  right-wing parties that want strict curbs on sea arrivals from North Africa. Alice Adely.
*10:36.440- 10:41.560* :  The former US president, Donald Trump, sells a lot of merchandise. His latest line,
*10:41.560- 10:47.100* :  his own official trainers, also known as sneakers. He unveiled them just a day after he was
*10:47.100- 10:54.600* :  fined $355 million in a New York court case. The rubber-sold shoes are called the never-surrender
*10:54.600- 10:59.340* :  high tops announced by Mr. Trump himself at a sneaker convention in Philadelphia.
*11:00.000- 11:04.440* :  But as Alfie Habershund reports, the response was mixed to say the least.
*11:17.040- 11:21.880* :  If perfume, pajamas and golf courses weren't enough, Americans can now get their hands on
*11:21.880- 11:26.840* :  official Donald Trump trainers. The boot-like shoes are a bright and shiny gold,
*11:27.360- 11:32.720* :  imprinted with a large T, where a Nike swoosh might be, and an American flag positioned on the
*11:32.720- 11:38.940* :  ankle. They are selling for almost $400 a pair. At America's biggest annual trainer event on Saturday
*11:38.940- 11:44.940* :  night, the former president stepped up to the stage, his new trainers proudly in hand, but not on his
*11:44.940- 11:50.720* :  feet to address a lively audience. We have a few young ladies that are up here crying. Look at you with
*11:50.720- 11:58.080* :  the Trump 2024. Thank you, darling. I love you too. Wow, a lot of emotion. There's a lot of
*11:58.080- 12:04.180* :  emotion in this world. Thank you. The never-surrender high tops sold out within two hours of the event,
*12:04.180- 12:10.880* :  with a special autograph pair going for $90,000 at auction. The extra cash may prove useful for Mr. Trump,
*12:10.880- 12:17.160* :  who on Friday was fined $355 million in a New York court case, after being found to have inflated
*12:17.160- 12:22.240* :  the value of his own wealth. He is also banned from running any corporation in the state for three
*12:22.240- 12:27.660* :  years, a huge blow to his own image as a New York real estate tycoon. This is in addition to the more
*12:27.660- 12:32.120* :  than $80 million he has to pay right to Eugene Carroll after losing a defamation case.
*12:32.880- 12:37.720* :  All this means an ever-widening line of merchandise may become more important for Mr. Trump,
*12:37.720- 12:42.820* :  with a costly presidential campaign against Joe Biden already underway. But holding his shoes
*12:42.820- 12:48.220* :  up high on Saturday nights, he said this isn't about any of that, but fulfilling a long-held
*12:48.220- 12:54.480* :  dream. This is something I've been talking about for 12 years, 13 years, and I think it's going
*12:54.480- 13:03.420* :  to be a big success. That's the real deal. That's the real deal. Turn on Trump ending that report by
*13:03.420- 13:11.280* :  Alfie Habersham. Still to come. Jane Rose has won equestrian medals for Australia at three
*13:11.280- 13:16.960* :  separate Olympics and is still hoping to go to Paris later this year. So why has the Australian

*15:26.240- 15:30.920* :  the move in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and that means another humanitarian
*15:30.940- 15:36.320* :  crisis is growing. Militants from the M23 rebel group have launched attacks on the Tower
*15:36.320- 15:41.660* :  Circuit, which controls the main roads going into the city of Goma. Thousands of people have been
*15:41.660- 15:47.500* :  displaced. Now the UN peacekeeping force in the area says it's reinforced its positions around
*15:47.500- 15:53.080* :  the city. So just how serious then is the risk for the people of Goma? I heard more from our
*15:53.080- 16:00.020* :  Africa regional editor, Julian Bedford. It's uncertain whether the M23 rebels actually want
*16:00.020- 16:07.240* :  to take Goma. Goma is a frontier city. It lies on the border with Rwanda. Rwanda are, in many
*16:07.240- 16:14.600* :  people's eyes, the sponsors of the M23 bringing a conflict to the front door of Rwanda is not
*16:14.600- 16:21.020* :  really in their interests. A lot of people think the M23 offensive is more directed towards the
*16:21.020- 16:27.420* :  south and towards checking off the population of Goma. So the real threat at the moment lies in
*16:27.420- 16:33.440* :  the supply lines for good food and other things medicines to be getting through to Goma because at
*16:33.440- 16:40.040* :  the moment that is a very very dodgy supply line. M23 control all the roads in and out of Goma,
*16:40.180- 16:47.960* :  North, South, East and West. They are the masters of logistics. Goma is best resupplied from its
*16:47.960- 16:53.680* :  immediate neighborhood or Bayer. That is a chief threat to close to 2 million people who live in
*16:53.680- 16:59.700* :  Goma now. Monosco that the UN peacekeeping force has been in there for pretty much 25 years now.
*17:00.260- 17:07.240* :  It's going to largely pull out soon. If it does, will it have any impact on security in the region?
*17:07.440- 17:13.060* :  I think if you've got a UN peacekeeping force in a region, it raises the profile of the conflict.
*17:13.100- 17:20.100* :  Eastern Congo is such a huge area with such poor communications. A force even one as
*17:20.100- 17:26.960* :  big as 16,000 troops can do very little. But Monosco has been heavily criticised for not taking
*17:26.960- 17:32.980* :  a proactive approach to the problem. They stay in their barracks, they do patrols but limited
*17:32.980- 17:39.300* :  patrols. They aren't out there protecting the local population and that's what's aroused the
*17:39.300- 17:45.200* :  eye of the local population. They want to be able to live their lives in peace and they thought
*17:45.240- 17:51.800* :  the UN were coming to give them that peace. Many people also feel that without pressure being put
*17:51.800- 17:59.760* :  on Rwanda to stop funding the M23 group, no number of peacekeeping troops can provide security.
*18:00.100- 18:07.340* :  No, I think you're right. If Rwanda is persuaded with draw its support from M23, then that particular
*18:07.340- 18:13.380* :  conflict will end. But as a student of Eastern Congo, Nick, you'll realise that there are lots of
*18:13.380- 18:19.740* :  other groups funded by other countries who would just move into the gap. It is very, very lawless
*18:19.740- 18:25.740* :  in that area. Why? Because the mineral riches, everyone knows that they can get rich if they can
*18:25.740- 18:32.600* :  control territory that has mining in it. Julian Bedford. Displaced by civil war and then forced
*18:32.600- 18:40.000* :  to turn to animal feed to survive. That is the situation reportedly faced by some, so say the
*18:40.000- 18:47.140* :  Darfur 24 News website in Sudan's Darfur region. Well, since civil war erupted across Sudan 10
*18:47.140- 18:51.720* :  months ago, millions of people have fled their homes and are now confronted with extreme hunger.
*18:51.980- 18:56.740* :  Fighting continues between the Sudanese Army and the rival paramilitary group, the rapid
*18:56.740- 19:01.720* :  support forces. I got more on how it's affecting people from the BBC's Africa correspondent
*19:01.720- 19:07.860* :  Dawker Swangirah. The humanitarian situation has been deteriorating. It has been said to be the
*19:07.860- 19:13.660* :  world's largest displacement crisis. Eight million people have been displaced and you also have
*19:13.660- 19:18.900* :  18 million people who are currently facing extreme hunger. Well, it is a very difficult situation
*19:18.960- 19:24.440* :  because you have a situation of conflict and then you have extreme hunger. So you have people
*19:24.440- 19:30.500* :  fleeing one devastating thing into another. So humanitarian agencies, UNICEF speaks about
*19:30.500- 19:36.720* :  14 million children in need of assistance and they are looking at 3.5 million children who will
*19:36.720- 19:42.720* :  suffer from acute malnutrition. There's also a report from MSF from Zamzam in northern Darfur
*19:42.720- 19:48.700* :  that was released in early February and their findings were very dire and they are talking about
*19:48.700- 19:54.300* :  at least one child dying every two hours in Zamzam and their kind estimate is that they are
*19:54.300- 19:59.940* :  around 13 child deaths each day. This particular camp in North Darfur. I mean, that is tragic, obviously.
*19:59.940- 20:07.380* :  What are the logistical reasons for this? Is it a lack of aid or an inability of the aid to get
*20:07.380- 20:12.180* :  through or a combination of the two? Well, it is a combination of the two. In fact,
*20:12.180- 20:17.600* :  there were reports that there were statements from the Sudanese Ami Chief General Abdel Fatal
*20:17.600- 20:23.140* :  Al-Burhan that he would not allow aid to enter into areas controlled by the RSF forces until he
*20:23.140- 20:28.220* :  defeats them. And there also reports from aid agencies that food is being piled up in some areas
*20:28.680- 20:32.700* :  and they can't access these areas because they are controlled by the RSF. Well, the situation
*20:32.700- 20:38.200* :  is agent because when you have, it's not just a lack of access but the refusal for aid to get
*20:38.200- 20:43.020* :  through. And the situation is on the agenda at the Munich Security Conference in Germany,
*20:43.100- 20:49.060* :  but the danger is it is going to fall off the radar of global leaders' attention, isn't it?
*20:49.240- 20:54.280* :  At this time, what is high on the agenda is your cream and even the situation in Gaza.
*20:55.080- 21:00.000* :  This has been happening in Sudan for months since April last year. We see reports of people
*21:00.000- 21:05.900* :  just telling the world how you've forgotten about us. So, for us here in Africa, for countries like
*21:05.900- 21:10.600* :  Chad that are bearing the brand when you have a lot of displaced people fleeing, this is not
*21:10.600- 21:13.460* :  something that they can forget. Was Dorkos Wangira?
*21:14.580- 21:19.320* :  Thailand's former Prime Minister, Taksin Shinowat, is back at his mansion in Bangkok,
*21:19.320- 21:25.200* :  following his release on parole. The 74-year-old wealthy businessman served six months of a one-year
*21:25.200- 21:30.640* :  jail term for corruption. He spent every day in a police hospital after complaining of health
*21:30.640- 21:36.200* :  problems. Well, critics have questioned whether his transfer was justified. Mr Taksin, a popular
*21:36.200- 21:41.900* :  but polarising figure, returned to Thailand last year after 15 years in exile. The Thai government,
*21:41.900- 21:46.680* :  which oversaw his release, is formed by a reincarnation, as it were, of the party that took
*21:46.680- 21:52.900* :  Taksin to power back in 2001. Jonathan Head, the BBC's correspondent in Bangkok, was there 20 years
*21:52.900- 21:59.240* :  ago and he's been following Taksin's progress ever since. Owen Bennett Jones asked him if Taksin
*21:59.240- 22:04.500* :  Shinowat is still a potent political force. No, he's not. At least that's my view. Look,
*22:05.060- 22:10.840* :  nobody would ever discount Taksin Shinowat. He's an abrasive, ambitious man with a tremendous
*22:10.840- 22:16.320* :  sense of destiny. But he has been ground down in those 15 years in exile. He desperately wanted
*22:16.320- 22:23.780* :  to come back. His party has been dissolved twice. His sister was ousted by, well, she was actually,
*22:23.780- 22:29.020* :  she was pushed out and ousted by a coup. Then she had a jail sentence imposed on her as he's had.
*22:29.620- 22:36.700* :  There's been a steady sort of attrition against the Shinowat family, even though his party kept
*22:36.700- 22:41.580* :  winning elections. But more importantly, at the last election that we saw in Thailand last year,
*22:42.020- 22:47.140* :  for the first time, his party did not win. It was kind of outclassed by a much bolder,
*22:47.320- 22:51.240* :  new, young reformist party move forward that actually won the election. But then the same
*22:51.240- 22:55.220* :  royalists who've been blocking Taksin all these years blocked move forward from taking power
*22:55.640- 23:00.580* :  and seem to have decided that given that he's a diminished figure, they can afford to let him back
*23:01.100- 23:06.140* :  and give him leniency, which is what we've seen today. Does he understand his own diminishment?
*23:07.240- 23:11.800* :  I don't know. I mean, from my experience of dealing with Mr. Taksin, it's not sure. But I suspect
*23:11.800- 23:16.680* :  in some ways he does. Look, he's very important in his party. And his party is technically in power,
*23:17.160- 23:22.560* :  his own man, a businessman called Set of Tabison, is the prime minister. But it's a coalition
*23:22.560- 23:28.600* :  government in which his party barely has half the seats. And he's in coalition with the very people
*23:28.600- 23:33.420* :  who've been bitterly fighting him, the hard-line royalist conservatives. It's a marriage of
*23:33.680- 23:38.900* :  convenience between these two. It's a messy government. They've made promises. They may not be able to
*23:38.900- 23:46.860* :  keep. Most people see his populist party, which dominated typolytics for 15 years, very much
*23:46.860- 23:51.420* :  as a declining force now. It ties, look for something different. Yeah, it's not easy to be populist,
*23:51.420- 23:56.400* :  when many people think he had quite a soft time of it in prison, smaller sentence, in a hospital,
*23:56.540- 24:03.560* :  parole quite quickly. Yeah, I mean, and look, they did a deal. We all know that. A deal was
*24:03.560- 24:08.240* :  done with the people he'd been fighting against all these years to bring him back. He's a very
*24:08.240- 24:13.040* :  rich man. He's got lots of residents. He's got tons of money. He can live very comfortably. His
*24:13.040- 24:17.920* :  political base were the largely the sort of poor and erm middle class, particularly in areas
*24:17.920- 24:22.840* :  outside Bangkok, who passionately believed he would change their lives. I think looking at his
*24:22.840- 24:28.540* :  party in this messy coalition government and him now out of prison after a deal, it's very likely
*24:28.540- 24:36.340* :  that his star is waning. Jonathan Hade. Oppenheimer, the three-hour epic about the making of the
*24:36.340- 24:41.600* :  atomic bomb, has won the prize for best film at the British Film Awards in London. The movie,
*24:41.600- 24:46.900* :  which had the most nominations at the BAFTAs, scooped seven awards in total. Christopher Nolan
*24:46.900- 24:52.360* :  took best director prize whilst the best actor, went to Killian Murphy for his eponymous role in
*24:52.360- 24:57.420* :  the biopic. The film also saw Robert Downey Jr. walk away with the best supporting actor, Gunn.
*24:57.640- 25:03.640* :  But the biggest hit at the box office last year, Barbie, failed to win an award. Colin Patterson
*25:03.640- 25:08.100* :  mingled with the stars on the red carpet at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Beth
*25:08.100- 25:13.940* :  goes to Oppenheimer. This is Oppenheimer's night at the BAFTAs. The three-hour historic
*25:13.940- 25:19.380* :  epic about the creation of the atomic bomb, won seven awards, including best film, best director
*25:19.380- 25:24.740* :  for Christopher Nolan, or best actor, went to Killian Murphy for playing the title role. Oppenheimer
*25:24.740- 25:30.900* :  was this classily naughty, complex character and he meant different things to different people
*25:30.900- 25:36.240* :  and, you know, one man's monster is another man's hero. Robert Downey Jr. was named best supporting
*25:36.240- 25:41.280* :  actor for his role as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission wanting to halt Oppenheimer's
*25:41.560- 25:47.840* :  influence. This win came 31 years after his only previous BAFTA for Chaplin, the longest gap
*25:47.840- 25:53.540* :  between triumphs in the award shows history. I am Bella Baxter and there is a world to enjoy.
*25:53.580- 25:59.980* :  The twisted steampunk fantasy purr things 15, with Emma Stone named best actress for the
*25:59.980- 26:04.860* :  second time in her career. I just want to start by thanking our dialect coach Neil Swain
*26:04.860- 26:10.320* :  because I was playing a British person in this movie and he did not laugh at me when he taught me
*26:10.320- 26:17.600* :  how to say water, even though as an American I say it like water. And the zone of interest,
*26:17.600- 26:22.800* :  Jonathan Glazer's German language film about the family life of a Nazi commander living over
*26:22.800- 26:28.540* :  the wall at Auschwitz became the first film in BAFTA history to win both outstanding British film
*26:28.540- 26:34.340* :  and film not in English. There was a standing evasion from Michael J. Foxx who's had Parkinson's
*26:34.340- 26:39.760* :  disease for more than 30 years and was the surprise presenter of best film. Thank you very much.
*26:40.060- 26:45.700* :  However, Barbie, despite being the biggest film of the year, won nothing. Next, in three weeks time,
*26:45.700- 26:50.140* :  the Oscars. Colin Patterson at the British Film Awards in London.
*26:51.400- 26:57.180* :  An Australian Olympic show jumper has been suspended from competing. That's after he wore a man
*26:57.180- 27:03.260* :  keeny at an event. Complaints were made about his skimpy attire whilst he was riding a horse near
*27:03.260- 27:09.120* :  Sydney. Steve Jackson takes up the tail. Shane Rose has won a question medals for Australia at
*27:09.120- 27:14.700* :  three separate Olympics and is still hoping to go to Paris later this year. He was taking part in
*27:14.700- 27:19.920* :  a competition in New South Wales in which riders had been encouraged to wear extraordinary costumes.
*27:20.060- 27:26.360* :  But the site of the 50 year old show jumping in a day glow orange man keeny was apparently too much
*27:26.360- 27:31.660* :  for someone. The sports governing body in Australia has stopped him from competing while it
*27:31.660- 27:37.280* :  investigates complaints. Several of Shane Rose's fellow Olympic show jumpers have accused a
*27:37.280- 27:42.200* :  question in Australia of overreacting. Steve Jackson reporting and if you don't know what a man
*27:42.200- 27:48.340* :  keeny is, look it up. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the
