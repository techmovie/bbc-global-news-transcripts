*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.160* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.640- 00:25.540* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 7th of February, these are our main stories.
*00:26.140- 00:31.680* :  A US appeals court denies Donald Trump's claim that he's immune from prosecution as a former president.
*00:32.400- 00:38.260* :  The Israeli military tells the families of 31 hostages held in Gaza that their loved ones are dead
*00:39.020- 00:45.080* :  and an army of angry farmers forces the EU to abandon its plans to harb the use of pesticides.
*00:45.500- 00:50.980* :  Issues have escalated in recent years. Our farmers deserve to be listened to.
*00:51.460- 00:55.900* :  I know that they are worried about the future of agriculture and about their future as farmers.
*00:59.060- 01:05.680* :  Also in this podcast, the former Chilean president Sebastian Pinyera has died in a helicopter crash.
*01:05.920- 01:10.280* :  And if you think about the sort of dilemmas that they were wrestling with at the time,
*01:10.280- 01:15.620* :  they are the biggest, most profound, most paradoxical, most important moral dilemmas that were still
*01:15.620- 01:22.400* :  wrestling with as a race. Killian Murphy on his starring role as the father of the atomic bomb in the
*01:22.400- 01:32.880* :  multiple Oscar nominated film Oppenheimer. Donald Trump may be the front runner to be the
*01:32.880- 01:39.060* :  next Republican candidate for the US presidential election. Some polls suggest he could even beat
*01:39.060- 01:45.200* :  President Biden, but Mr. Trump has been battling several criminal charges, including plotting to
*01:45.200- 01:51.760* :  overturn the 2020 election. He's argued that he has presidential immunity, but now the US
*01:51.760- 01:57.320* :  court has ruled against him, saying he can be prosecuted. Donald Trump described the ruling on
*01:57.320- 02:02.900* :  his social media platform as nation destroying, as I heard from our correspondent in Washington
*02:02.900- 02:08.000* :  Nomiya Igbel. That's the kind of reaction that I think we expected from Donald Trump, but the
*02:08.000- 02:13.640* :  three judges that came up with their ruling. They said that what Donald Trump was presenting here
*02:13.640- 02:19.380* :  with his immunity claim would, I quote, collapse our system of separated powers by placing the
*02:19.380- 02:24.220* :  president beyond the reach of all three branches. So their argument is, well, actually what he was
*02:25.040- 02:29.360* :  suggesting would be, I would argue, they would be saying his nation destroying, but this is a
*02:29.360- 02:33.600* :  major setback for him. This was his defense that he was relying on, but the judges were basically
*02:33.600- 02:39.300* :  saying, look, if you can get immunity, then by that logic, as a president, you could self-state
*02:39.300- 02:43.360* :  secrets. You could order the assassination of a political rival, not face any criminal
*02:44.100- 02:47.480* :  consequences. And they have ruled that for the purposes of the elections of version case,
*02:47.900- 02:52.240* :  former president Trump has become citizen Trump and therefore should be treated like any other
*02:52.240- 02:57.120* :  criminal defendant. So he says he'll appeal. It looks like it's headed for the Supreme Court,
*02:57.120- 03:01.760* :  doesn't it? There are a few options here. Trump's team might request that the full 11 judge
*03:01.760- 03:06.540* :  DC circuit course of appeals, refusing to reconsider this case. That's probably not going to happen.
*03:07.060- 03:11.100* :  And the appeals court has said that, even if that sort of requested happened, the six january
*03:11.100- 03:16.680* :  case can still proceed. But yes, one likely route is he can turn to the Supreme Court, but the
*03:16.680- 03:20.940* :  Supreme Court can refuse to hear the case. They might decide, this is too politically charged,
*03:20.940- 03:25.540* :  we're not going to touch it. But let's just say the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case.
*03:25.540- 03:29.380* :  The election interference case can then return to its normal schedule, but let's just say the
*03:29.380- 03:34.180* :  Supreme Court decides to put it on their docket. That pretty much guarantees that this trial could
*03:34.180- 03:39.820* :  take place very close to election day. And that is a victory for Donald Trump. What he essentially
*03:39.820- 03:45.300* :  wants is that this trial and all the other trials are delayed until after the presidential election
*03:45.300- 03:50.060* :  in November. So what is going to happen next? Because as you indicated, there are an awful lot of
*03:50.060- 03:54.540* :  trials waiting to happen, aren't there? At the moment it's so unknown because we were expected
*03:54.540- 03:59.740* :  that the trial in DC to take place next month. We know that Donald Trump is planning to appeal
*03:59.740- 04:04.180* :  he's gone to February the 12th to make that appeal. As I say, we'll see what the Supreme Court
*04:04.180- 04:09.860* :  does. Will they let the lower court decision stand? They can also decide whether to put the January
*04:09.860- 04:15.400* :  6 trial on hold in the meantime. I'd be very surprised the Supreme Court did get involved. It's
*04:15.400- 04:21.400* :  a very politically charged case, but you never know. But at this stage right now, we know that his
*04:21.400- 04:26.940* :  election subversion case isn't happening as planned next month, but when it happens, we just don't
*04:27.700- 04:33.020* :  know yet. Nomiya Ikbal in Washington. Hamas has delivered its response to the
*04:33.020- 04:38.360* :  framework proposal for a new ceasefire in Gaza. The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said
*04:38.360- 04:43.140* :  Washington was reviewing the response. He said he would discuss it with the Israeli government
*04:43.140- 04:48.200* :  during his visit there on Wednesday. Mr. Blinken was speaking at a news conference in Doha
*04:48.200- 04:52.740* :  with the Katari Prime Minister on the latest leg of his shuttle diplomacy.
*04:53.380- 04:57.940* :  There's still a lot of work to be done, but we continue to believe that an agreement is possible
*04:57.940- 05:02.980* :  and indeed essential, and we will continue to work relentlessly to achieve it. We're also
*05:02.980- 05:08.560* :  determined to use any pause to continue to pave a diplomatic path forward to a just and lasting
*05:08.560- 05:15.260* :  piece for the region. That is the best way to ensure that October 7 and the tragic loss of
*05:15.260- 05:22.320* :  life by Israelis and Palestinians is not repeated. Anthony Blinken, on Tuesday, the Israeli
*05:22.380- 05:27.920* :  military announced some devastating news for the families of the remaining hostages in Gaza,
*05:27.920- 05:32.700* :  31 of them are dead. Our correspondent, Injury Salam, is Barbara Patasha.
*05:33.040- 05:36.860* :  This is something the Israeli military has now confirmed, and as you said,
*05:37.220- 05:43.280* :  called up the families and even them that news, just as Mr. Blinken is in the region and talking
*05:43.280- 05:49.380* :  about a ceasefire to try to get the rest of the hostages released. But there are still around
*05:49.380- 05:54.880* :  a hundred, we believe, are being held in Gaza. And this is going to only increase
*05:54.880- 06:00.580* :  pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yes, there has been a lot of pressure
*06:00.580- 06:05.480* :  on Mr. Netanyahu already from families of the hostages that have wanted to make the government
*06:05.480- 06:11.360* :  a priority to reach a hostage deal instead of pressing ahead with the military operations,
*06:11.360- 06:16.260* :  because they're afraid that their relatives will be killed in the crossfire. The Israeli military
*06:16.260- 06:22.420* :  and officials have been arguing is that as they put more pressure on Hamas, then Hamas is more
*06:22.420- 06:27.360* :  likely to negotiate. And it also puts them in a position to be able to rescue the remaining
*06:27.360- 06:32.800* :  captives if necessary. But they have only managed to rescue one hostage so far and actually accidentally
*06:32.800- 06:38.380* :  killed three of them. So I think for the hostage families, anything that suggests that family
*06:38.380- 06:43.740* :  members are in danger is going to make them want to push for a hostage deal as soon as possible.
*06:44.240- 06:50.220* :  Anthony Blinken going to Israel next, but is he any nearer to actually achieving either the release
*06:50.220- 06:56.240* :  of hostages or a temporary ceasefire in Gaza? Well, we were waiting for Hamas to respond to the
*06:56.240- 07:01.140* :  proposal and now has given its response while Mr. Blinken is in the region. So that means that he
*07:01.140- 07:06.980* :  has something concrete to discuss with the Israelis. He didn't say what that Hamas reply entailed,
*07:06.980- 07:11.140* :  but a senior Hamas official who spoke to the BBC said the group had asked for a number of things,
*07:11.140- 07:16.620* :  including a clear timetable for the reconstruction of Gaza and transferring the wounded to hospitals
*07:16.620- 07:21.420* :  abroad. And we also saw that the group released a statement which made it pretty clear it wants
*07:21.420- 07:26.000* :  any truth to lead to an end to the war. We also know, of course, that the Israelis have said there's
*07:26.000- 07:30.980* :  no chance that this could lead to a permanent ceasefire. So that would likely continue to be a
*07:30.980- 07:35.340* :  matter of negotiation. And Mr. Blinken said there was still a lot of work to be done. But those who
*07:35.340- 07:39.440* :  drafted this proposal, including the Americans and the Egyptians and the Qataris, are hoping
*07:39.440- 07:44.260* :  that it will lead to a lengthy ceasefire, which we'll receive the return of the rest of the
*07:44.260- 07:49.580* :  Israeli hostages and also get a dramatic amount of aid into Gaza and then lay the groundwork
*07:49.580- 07:54.540* :  for a post-war arrangement. So the Americans are quite invested in this and this is a development
*07:54.540- 07:59.940* :  that will help Mr. Blinken move things forward or at least talk things further through with the
*07:59.940- 08:06.720* :  Israelis on Wednesday. Barbara Platt, I'll share in Jerusalem. Now, let's return to a story that we
*08:06.720- 08:12.740* :  reported on in our previous global news podcast. The leader of a doomsday cult in Kenya who was
*08:12.740- 08:19.900* :  judged on Tuesday with 191 counts of murder. Paul McKenzie and 29 others pleaded not guilty to
*08:19.900- 08:25.480* :  starving hundreds of members to death before a court in the coastal town of Melindi, more than
*08:25.480- 08:30.900* :  400 bodies, including those of children were exhumed from shallow graves on a piece of land thought
*08:30.900- 08:36.620* :  to be owned by the controversial preacher. The BBC's Anne Saway met some of those who survived the
*08:36.620- 08:42.720* :  cult and families of those who weren't so lucky. A warning, a report, does include some upsetting
*08:42.720- 08:52.180* :  testimony. The pain of a father who's lost all his children. Stephen Whitty breaks down repeatedly
*08:52.180- 08:57.820* :  well narrating what happened to them. His wife, Baha'i John, he says, followed the teachings of
*08:57.820- 09:03.160* :  the controversial preacher Paul McKenzie. He shows us his children's school uniforms and bags.
*09:03.880- 09:09.300* :  He wanted them to go to school, but his wife didn't. The charge she joined preached against
*09:09.300- 09:15.700* :  formal education, so the couple fought over it and he'd forcefully tech the children to school himself.
*09:17.980- 09:22.940* :  I left for work. When I came back, I found there are no children. She only left the children's
*09:22.940- 09:30.220* :  school uniforms and bags. One day, he received alarming reports about her family. He went to
*09:30.220- 09:34.620* :  Shakahola, an expansive forest northwest of the coastal city of Mumbai's away lives,
*09:34.620- 09:41.320* :  to investigate. Nothing could have prepared him for what he found. Dead or dying children and
*09:41.320- 09:47.320* :  emaciated followers of a cult that arched its members to fast until they met Jesus. He found
*09:47.320- 09:54.280* :  only one grandson whom he rescued, together with another child. He experienced the death of his
*09:54.280- 10:01.520* :  brothers. He saw them being stabbed by their parents and that the story that he will never forget.
*10:01.520- 10:07.720* :  So he knew that was next, but it was like he was rescued. After children, women were the second
*10:07.720- 10:16.500* :  group to be forced to starve. We meet one of the women survivors. She seems lost in fault.
*10:16.500- 10:22.000* :  She watches chicken roam around her compound as she cuddles her one year old. She was pregnant
*10:22.000- 10:29.680* :  with her when she went to Shakahola. It was difficult for us. Imagine six men gang raping you.
*10:30.220- 10:35.440* :  They would pick us in tons. It was a church initially but preaching stopped and they started
*10:35.440- 10:42.220* :  raping and killing people. This is Shakahola shopping center. When McCain's first came here,
*10:42.500- 10:48.620* :  the residents welcomed him. He said he'd moved here to farm. Then the residents heard that he ran
*10:48.620- 10:54.060* :  a charge. Not a problem to the locals. Their presence here was actually good for business.
*10:55.000- 10:59.960* :  But then suddenly they stopped coming to the shops and the red flags began to emerge.
*11:00.840- 11:06.080* :  Changawa Mangi, the village elder, went to find out what was going on. What he saw there,
*11:06.080- 11:13.320* :  shocked him. Some were afraid, looking like they will die within hours. Others were stronger,
*11:13.320- 11:18.160* :  but they didn't want to be rescued. They were asking the police why are you disturbing us?
*11:18.640- 11:21.620* :  Yet we want to go to Jesus. Won't you also die one day?
*11:23.880- 11:28.620* :  McCain's he has told the court he never forced anyone to starve. Some of his followers
*11:28.620- 11:34.960* :  still believe in his teachings. But to families that lost their kin, the pain they now have to live
*11:34.960- 11:43.600* :  is a measure abroad. And soy with that report. For weeks, angry farmers across Europe have
*11:43.600- 11:48.980* :  been protesting against a combination of high fuel costs, cheap imports and mounting paperwork.
*11:48.980- 11:55.280* :  They're also angry at the EU's Green Agenda, which includes proposals to halve pesticide use.
*11:55.280- 12:01.280* :  Well, on Tuesday, the head of the European Commission, Ursula Fondolin, announced it was a
*12:01.280- 12:06.940* :  abandoning plans to drastically reduce pesticide use in a concession to protesting farmers.
*12:07.820- 12:13.140* :  Issues have escalated in recent years. Our farmers deserve to be listened to.
*12:13.140- 12:17.900* :  I know that they are worried about the future of agriculture and about their future as farmers,
*12:18.520- 12:24.560* :  but they also know that agriculture needs to move to a more sustainable model of production,
*12:25.300- 12:28.740* :  so that their farms remain profitable in the years to come.
*12:29.480- 12:34.940* :  I asked out Europe Regional Editor Danny Abahart, why did Ursula Fondolin cave in now?
*12:35.420- 12:39.680* :  The EU Commission has been under sustained pressure from countries, including France,
*12:39.720- 12:46.180* :  where there was a major protest blocking the French capital. There was a separate protest today,
*12:46.180- 12:50.860* :  obviously, in Spain. And a number of politicians have come to Brussels and said that we have
*12:50.860- 12:55.980* :  to change this because it's becoming politically toxic. The Commission has already said that some of
*12:55.980- 13:01.840* :  the regulations on landline fallow, which is an idea to try to improve the quality of the soil and
*13:02.680- 13:07.020* :  biodiversity, but there'll be more exemptions on that. The backdrop to all this, which is the
*13:07.020- 13:12.320* :  important thing, is there's European elections coming up in June, Alex, and there fears among some
*13:12.320- 13:18.800* :  centrist pro-EU politicians that the far right and the far left will benefit from these sort of
*13:18.800- 13:23.000* :  disputes. So this is why we're seeing the Commission move on some of these restrictions.
*13:23.320- 13:28.620* :  The pesticide deal was part of the Green Deal, and which is a whole series of measures that
*13:28.620- 13:33.940* :  the Commission is rolling out, to try to restore degraded ecosystems. And environmentalists will say,
*13:33.940- 13:39.200* :  it's all well and good saying that farmers can use chemical pesticides and not tackle that issue,
*13:39.220- 13:45.200* :  but then you're having at the same time a collapse in biodiversity. So things like insect pollinators
*13:45.200- 13:51.880* :  of crops are at very low levels across some parts of the EU. Soil health is not good, and the
*13:51.880- 13:57.400* :  toxic chemicals are not good for the public health. So they accuse a lobby group, basically, of
*13:57.400- 14:03.360* :  pushing to get these pesticide restrictions repealed. They said that that's why, for example,
*14:03.360- 14:08.360* :  the European Parliament blocked the regulation earlier. So the regulation was in trouble anyway,
*14:08.700- 14:13.040* :  and in some ways it's an easy win for the Commission to say, look, we're showing willing, we're
*14:13.040- 14:17.400* :  cutting back on some of these restrictions that the farmers are complaining about, but they haven't
*14:17.400- 14:21.840* :  completely abandoned them either. So the farmers going to continue their protests? I can
*14:21.840- 14:27.000* :  confidently say that there will be continued farmers protests. As in many disputes, once you
*14:27.000- 14:32.300* :  start getting concessions, the logic is that you may be able to get more and a whole load of other
*14:32.300- 14:39.400* :  nations, so Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland, Romania as well, will also continue. Dani Aberhardt.
*14:40.100- 14:45.140* :  The former president of Chile, Sebastian Piñera, has died in a helicopter crash.
*14:45.140- 14:49.040* :  Reports say the aircraft had encountered bad weather in the south of the country,
*14:49.040- 14:54.400* :  our South America correspondent and our only world reports. Chile's interior minister confirmed
*14:54.400- 14:58.360* :  four people were involved in a helicopter crash on Tuesday. While three people survived
*14:58.360- 15:02.660* :  to the former president, Sebastian Piñera was killed. The army have recovered his body.
*15:02.660- 15:08.220* :  Sebastian Piñera was a conservative politician who was the president of Chile from 2010 to 2014,
*15:08.220- 15:14.140* :  and again from 2018 until last year. He was also a billionaire businessman, one of the richest men
*15:14.140- 15:19.400* :  in Chile. Politicians around South America have paid tribute to Mr Piñera. The former president
*15:19.400- 15:24.000* :  of Argentina, Maurizio Macri, said he felt immense sadness for the death of his dear friend,
*15:24.000- 15:29.520* :  and it was an irreplaceable loss. Ivan Duque, the former president of Colombia, said he felt
*15:29.520- 15:38.660* :  great sadness for the death of his friend. I only wells. Still to come in the global news podcast,
*15:38.660- 15:43.940* :  why elephants are dying in big numbers in Sri Lanka? When they come into conflict with
*15:43.940- 15:49.080* :  farmers, they get annoyed because their crops are damaged. So they use what they call jaw bombs,
*15:49.140- 15:54.180* :  where they mix the explosives with some food and keep it. When they eat it, then it explodes in their mouth.
*16:02.820- 16:08.740* :  Two years ago, Ethan Crumbly killed four of his classmates at his school in the US state of Michigan.
*16:08.740- 16:13.700* :  He was 15 at the time, and the gun he used was given to him by his mother and father.
*16:14.120- 16:19.700* :  A jury has now found Jennifer Crumbly guilty of involuntary manslaughter, which carries a prison
*16:19.700- 16:24.840* :  sentence of up to 15 years, more from our North America correspondent John Sudworth.
*16:25.160- 16:29.780* :  There have been all sorts of attempts amid this epidemic of gun violence in America to hold
*16:29.780- 16:35.880* :  third parties accountable, but this is the first criminal case of this kind, and it's undoubtedly
*16:35.880- 16:42.280* :  significant in a pretty conservative part of Middle America, a jury deciding that there was enough
*16:42.280- 16:49.520* :  evidence that Jennifer Crumbly could have foreseen the actions of her son. There had been a number
*16:49.520- 16:55.280* :  of warning signs disturbing drawings that the school had brought to his parents' attention,
*16:55.280- 17:00.260* :  but the argument in court was that they hadn't done enough to warn the school, and in fact,
*17:00.260- 17:05.120* :  on the very same morning that they were contacted to say that there were concerns about their son,
*17:05.120- 17:09.840* :  they allowed him to return to class without telling the school that he even owned a gun.
*17:09.840- 17:14.860* :  He'd been bought a handgun as an early Christmas present, so that's what's at the heart of this case,
*17:15.160- 17:20.140* :  but in terms of exactly what kind of precedent it sets, that will be for the next stages of the
*17:20.140- 17:26.700* :  legal process, if indeed there is an appeal. John Sudworth. King Charles has been seen in public
*17:26.700- 17:31.340* :  for the first time since it was announced that he has cancer. He was sitting in the back of a car
*17:31.340- 17:37.180* :  alongside the Queen, leaving his residence Clarence House in London. The King is believed to have
*17:37.180- 17:43.000* :  spoken to his youngest son, Prince Harry, who returned to the UK from California. Royal correspondent
*17:43.020- 17:51.400* :  Daniela Rolf has been following developments. As he was driven into Buckingham Palace,
*17:51.940- 17:56.720* :  crowds gathered outside the main gates to catch a glimpse of the King, with him was his wife,
*17:56.720- 18:01.880* :  Queen Camilla. The couple then travelled by helicopter to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk,
*18:02.340- 18:07.460* :  where he was spent time between treatments. It is a place where those who work with him say he
*18:07.460- 18:12.820* :  finds solace and happiness. Before the King left London, there was a family visitor to host.
*18:15.260- 18:19.360* :  Straight from the airport to see his father, the Duke of Sussex is back in the UK,
*18:19.980- 18:26.100* :  flying in from his home in California. Prince Harry spent around 45 minutes at Clarence House
*18:26.100- 18:31.400* :  with his father. They hadn't seen each other since the coronation in May. Julian Payne,
*18:31.400- 18:36.280* :  the King's former head of communications, said this was an important moment for father and son.
*18:36.660- 18:41.720* :  The Royal family at its core is a family just like any other and when a member of your family is
*18:41.720- 18:46.220* :  unwell, you want to go and see them, you want to express your love and support and you want to
*18:46.220- 18:50.640* :  do what you can to help, but it will be a very human reaction to a difficult challenge
*18:50.640- 18:55.520* :  that the King is facing and that will be what's lying behind it. With the King clearing his diary and
*18:55.520- 19:00.780* :  focusing on his cancer treatment and desk-based duties, other royal engagements are now for the
*19:00.780- 19:07.100* :  wider family. The Conservative Peer, Lord Dobbs, is a friend of the King. He has praised him for
*19:07.100- 19:12.580* :  going public. He's encouraging us to come out of the shadows not to treat it as something which is
*19:12.580- 19:18.420* :  going to be so appalling you can't face up to it. I'm surviving cancer. My brother has survived
*19:18.420- 19:24.500* :  six different cancers. It's not what it was 20 years ago, so it's a modern look from a modern
*19:24.500- 19:30.240* :  monarchy about a very old-fashioned problem. Buckingham Palace is now reworking the King's schedule.
*19:30.940- 19:37.000* :  Official visits abroad are on hold. All decisions are dependent on how the King responds to
*19:37.000- 19:43.180* :  treatment. Daniela Ralf with that report. One of the world's leading experts on international
*19:43.180- 19:49.140* :  law has claimed the International Criminal Court, the ICC, is involved in a turf war with other
*19:49.140- 19:54.060* :  institutions. Philippe Sans has said this is preventing Ukraine from establishing a special
*19:54.060- 19:59.440* :  tribunal to try Russia's leadership for the crime of aggression. The ICC is based in the
*19:59.440- 20:05.140* :  Hague in the Netherlands. A correspondent there is Anna Holligan. And the tribunal at the heart of
*20:05.140- 20:10.200* :  this alleged turf war is specifically focused on the crime of aggression. Crime of aggression,
*20:10.680- 20:16.960* :  planning, initiation or execution of a large-scale and serious act of aggression using state
*20:16.960- 20:23.780* :  military force. Philippe Sans said the reason why prosecuting this in the context of Russia is because
*20:24.200- 20:30.620* :  it's the only way to reach the top table with any degree of certitude. So you might think this
*20:30.620- 20:35.660* :  task would fall to the ICC, which is based here in the Hague. A court of last resort designed to
*20:35.660- 20:39.780* :  hold the most powerful individuals to account for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
*20:40.440- 20:46.120* :  But it doesn't have jurisdiction over alleged Russian crimes of aggression because Russia
*20:46.660- 20:52.780* :  is not assigned up to the wrong statute, which underpins the ICC. So speculation has been swirling
*20:52.780- 20:56.840* :  for months about what a tribunal would look like, how it would be created. And I believe
*20:56.840- 21:02.400* :  Sans has come up and has said a conference in London last week attended by a number of Ukrainian
*21:02.400- 21:08.900* :  ministers that it's Karim Karn's fault. The ICC prosecutor, he says, is blocking the establishment
*21:08.900- 21:15.740* :  of this tribunal because it's a matter of turf rather than principle. He wants the ICC to do with
*21:15.740- 21:21.220* :  any possible prosecution of President Putin. He doesn't want that to fall to an international
*21:21.260- 21:28.000* :  ad hoc tribunal. Briefly any reaction from Mr. Karn? Yes, he has denied these claims. He
*21:28.000- 21:33.580* :  points to the unprecedented partnerships with Ukrainian authorities. He points out the ICC has
*21:33.580- 21:39.660* :  been part of the joint investigation team, which has been set up, also participating in the creation
*21:39.700- 21:44.660* :  of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression. So denying that, but
*21:45.040- 21:50.760* :  Karim Karn was once Philippe Sans student. And so this really captures how complex this whole
*21:50.760- 21:58.420* :  issue is. Anna Holligan in the hage. Trilankers endangered elephants are dying at an unprecedented
*21:58.420- 22:04.340* :  rate. In the past year alone, 470 elephants have died. Now, South Asia, original editor and
*22:04.340- 22:09.900* :  barisan Etter-Rajan has been in Trilanker to investigate. He told my colleague James Reynolds
*22:09.900- 22:15.020* :  what's behind the surge in deaths. Once upon a time, Sri Lanka used to have thousands of
*22:15.020- 22:20.580* :  elephants. Now, the numbers have dwindled to less than 6,000. In the last 10-15 years,
*22:20.580- 22:27.040* :  there has been increasing conflict between elephants and human beings, because both are competing
*22:27.040- 22:32.660* :  for the same resources. As Sri Lanka develops, the agricultural lands are increasing,
*22:33.300- 22:38.560* :  and lands are also taken over for industrial growth, for laying highways, big ports,
*22:39.100- 22:44.320* :  and elephants, they move long distances. They have this habit of going from one area of Sri Lanka
*22:44.320- 22:49.440* :  to another. It's not like a continuous territory like you have India, Bangladesh, Nepal, where
*22:49.440- 22:54.960* :  elephants can cross boundaries and go into other countries here. It's an island. So you have to go
*22:54.960- 23:00.000* :  from South to the North or from east to the West. When they come into conflict with farmers and
*23:00.000- 23:06.180* :  they get annoyed because their crops are damaged by the raiding elephants. So they use what they
*23:06.180- 23:11.280* :  call jaw bombs, where they mix the explosives with some food and keep it. When they eat it,
*23:11.500- 23:15.940* :  then it explodes in the mouth, and then they also have electric fencing, illegal fencing.
*23:16.380- 23:21.380* :  So when they come into these electric fences, they get shocked and they die, and people use guns,
*23:21.380- 23:26.720* :  as well. But out of this 470, nearly half died of illnesses. They fight with each other,
*23:26.720- 23:31.400* :  natural causes, but half of them are killed by humans. That is a worrying sign, because
*23:31.560- 23:36.540* :  this is the second consecutive year they have crossed 400 and highest on record last year.
*23:36.760- 23:41.240* :  You heard, and by the sound from a Sri Lankan man whose father was killed by an elephant,
*23:41.240- 23:47.080* :  what will play an audience that could? In my parents' house, the toilet is outside,
*23:47.520- 23:52.720* :  about 25 meters from the house. When my father went to the toilet, suddenly an elephant attacked
*23:52.720- 23:57.880* :  him. It was dark, and he didn't realize that the elephants was already inside our compound.
*23:58.000- 24:03.300* :  My mother raised the alarm, and we all shouted and chased the elephants away. We rushed my
*24:03.300- 24:08.600* :  father to the hospital, but he died of his injuries two days later. We yet to recover from the shock.
*24:08.600- 24:13.400* :  Even now, we're scared to go outside our house after 6 p.m., we're scared that elephants
*24:13.400- 24:19.540* :  may be somewhere. That was Sanji Bandara from Kilinder Village in Central Sri Lanka.
*24:19.920- 24:24.800* :  So these people, elephants, a threat, they killed a relative there, and if conservationists say,
*24:24.800- 24:28.400* :  well, you need to protect elephants, presumably Sanji and everyone in the village say,
*24:28.400- 24:33.380* :  you know, you need to protect humans. It's a huge problem. What we don't see if you go
*24:33.380- 24:38.960* :  as a tourist, you go to the forest to see the elephants, whereas you just go take the side roads,
*24:38.960- 24:43.720* :  some of the mud roads, go into the villages. There is a completely different world existing,
*24:43.760- 24:48.920* :  because they're frightened. I have met a number of families there, whose relatives were killed
*24:48.920- 24:56.000* :  by the elephants. And there is a sort of curfew after 6 p.m., people don't go out of the houses,
*24:56.420- 25:00.680* :  it's happening all across Sri Lanka. And this village is one of the areas what they call as
*25:00.680- 25:06.520* :  front lines of human animal conflict. So nobody goes out, even if you want to go to a friend's house,
*25:06.520- 25:12.540* :  for a meal or meeting a friend, unless it is very essential, they don't step out of the house,
*25:12.540- 25:17.040* :  because they don't know what is there. In fact, one of the government officials was working with
*25:17.040- 25:21.440* :  the community. He was telling us, we don't even come by car in this load in the night, because
*25:21.440- 25:26.680* :  the elephants may come across, and they roam around freely. And Barassan et Aarajan,
*25:26.680- 25:34.160* :  speaking to James Reynolds. Now, to a well-worn phrase, money can't buy happiness. Over the years,
*25:34.160- 25:39.820* :  various studies have looked into whether it's true with conflicting results. Now, researchers have
*25:39.820- 25:45.760* :  decided to speak to people beyond their traditional sample, indigenous tribes to try to learn more.
*25:45.760- 25:51.540* :  Stephanie Prentice told Nigel Adely what they found. It is worth looking at the sample,
*25:51.540- 25:56.760* :  this study used. It's decent. It's almost 3,000 people from 19 indigenous communities,
*25:56.760- 26:02.220* :  and it's all around the world. What they found was that people living in these remote communities
*26:02.220- 26:08.900* :  with what the team called very little money were as happy as the average person in high-income
*26:08.900- 26:15.340* :  western countries. In fact, some of them reported being happier. This, of course, goes against the
*26:15.340- 26:20.320* :  idea that economic growth is the way to increase the well-being of people in low-income countries.
*26:20.900- 26:25.380* :  It goes against other global surveys in recent decades that support that sort of strategy,
*26:25.380- 26:29.840* :  like the World Happiness Report. They turned together data from people in industrialized societies,
*26:30.340- 26:34.560* :  perhaps overlooking people in small-scale ones where things like the exchange of money just
*26:34.820- 26:39.760* :  plays a more minimal role in their everyday life. Now, while the team were very confident in
*26:39.760- 26:44.360* :  concluding that many people in indigenous communities had high levels of satisfaction,
*26:45.120- 26:49.560* :  what they admitted they didn't know was exactly why. And the lead researcher, he was from
*26:49.560- 26:54.660* :  McGill University in BC Canada, he called for more learning and said western nations should
*26:54.660- 27:00.780* :  deep-dive into why this is. Finland has been voted as the happiest country in the world for the
*27:00.780- 27:07.740* :  last six years. So, could that title now be under threat? Well, four of those communities infued
*27:07.740- 27:12.840* :  averaged out of happiness in eight out of ten, while Finland, which is on that streak,
*27:12.840- 27:18.440* :  have been crowned the happiest place to live. Again, by the World Happiness Report, they had 7.9.
*27:18.440- 27:23.280* :  Now, I actually went to Finland last summer when they were announced the happiest country, again,
*27:23.720- 27:28.340* :  and interviewed people about it. And there was a real alchemy to this as to why people say
*27:28.340- 27:33.100* :  they're so happy. I mean, in Finland's case, despite being a relatively wealthy nation, a lot of
*27:33.100- 27:38.320* :  the reasons were very simple things like being happy outside in nature, being there often,
*27:38.320- 27:43.680* :  spending time with loved ones, taking time out to sit in a sauna, preparing food, enjoying food.
*27:43.680- 27:49.120* :  They also spoke to a lack of striving to be seen as wealthy, or to even display their wealth.
*27:49.340- 27:55.480* :  And while the researchers in this new study didn't have a Y metric in place, they did speculate that
*27:55.480- 28:01.100* :  indigenous communities experience more social support, spirituality, and more of that connection
*28:01.100- 28:08.500* :  to nature. Stephanie Prentice. On Sunday, it was Taylor Swift, who stole the show at the Grammys,
*28:08.500- 28:14.440* :  next month it could be Oppenheimer, which leads to the Oscars. The film focuses on the theoretical
*28:14.440- 28:20.540* :  physicist Jay Robert Oppenheimer, who led the effort to create the atomic bomb. Directed by
*28:20.540- 28:26.100* :  Christopher Nolan, it's been a critical and commercial hit with 13 nominations at both the
*28:26.100- 28:32.360* :  British Film Academy Awards and the Oscars. Our culture editor Katie Razzle has been speaking
*28:32.360- 28:38.400* :  to Killian Murphy, whose portrayal of Oppenheimer has earned him best actor nominations.
*28:49.260- 28:54.140* :  Killian Murphy looks like the one to beat in the awards race for his transformation into Jay
*28:54.140- 29:00.260* :  Robert Oppenheimer, gaunt, morally torn, and the father of the atomic bomb. I think most people
*29:00.760- 29:04.940* :  looking at it would think you're the front runner and I wonder if that's an uncomfortable place to be
*29:04.940- 29:09.260* :  when it comes to the Oscars or indeed the bafters. Oh I genuinely don't think about that,
*29:09.260- 29:14.180* :  it's kind of wasted energy. Our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.
*29:14.740- 29:20.100* :  Oppenheimer and a team of scientists working for the US government created the bomb that was used
*29:20.100- 29:25.200* :  controversially to end the Second World War. A weighty subject for director Christopher Nolan,
*29:25.200- 29:30.200* :  and a commercial hit, the film's taken nearly 800 million pounds at the box office.
*29:30.480- 29:34.820* :  People come up to me in the street and say that they've seen the film four and five times,
*29:34.820- 29:39.280* :  which is just phenomenal and very flattering. When Christopher Nolan comes to you and says,
*29:39.280- 29:45.220* :  I want you to play the theoretical physicist Oppenheimer, how do you know that you're going to be
*29:45.220- 29:49.420* :  able to do it? Can you practice for it in any way? I need to not know. If I know instantly,
*29:49.420- 29:54.700* :  I can do that, I generally don't take the part because then it doesn't represent any kind of
*29:54.700- 30:00.660* :  challenge to me. And you never kind of fully know we've got it. I don't know if we can be trusted.
*30:02.300- 30:07.940* :  What's such a weapon? Clearly it takes a while from when you make a film to when it comes out.
*30:08.860- 30:13.720* :  I wonder when you were making it. Did it feel like a very timely film? And do you feel it's timely now?
*30:14.160- 30:20.200* :  Russia just invaded Ukraine just before we started shooting, so of course it was on everyone's mind.
*30:20.800- 30:25.300* :  We're all living in a nuclear world because of Oppenheimer. It seems to ebb and flow with
*30:25.300- 30:30.060* :  the level of threat, right? It's always there. It's like this sort of sort of damacles and people
*30:30.480- 30:35.660* :  choose to think about it or not. But I think good writing is always prescient. Oppenheimer's story is
*30:35.660- 30:40.100* :  a story of the 20th century. It has to be entertaining primarily, but if it's provocative,
*30:40.100- 30:43.540* :  it makes you think about what's happening in the world today. I think that's a really good bonus.
*30:43.540- 30:52.660* :  We imagine a future and our imagining's horrifiers. And it is a film about theoretical physics.
*30:52.780- 30:58.300* :  Yeah. Did you ever worry that it wouldn't be appreciated? This is actually a very human story.
*30:58.340- 31:02.440* :  And if you think about the sort of dilemmas that they were wrestling with at the time,
*31:02.440- 31:08.200* :  they are the biggest, most profound, most paradoxical, most important kind of moral dilemmas that
*31:08.200- 31:12.420* :  were still wrestling with as a race. And were you good at maths and science at school? Did you
*31:12.420- 31:17.480* :  understand the equations you were writing on the board in any way? No. I talked to Kip Thorne,
*31:17.480- 31:21.740* :  who's a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. He was actually lectured by Oppenheimer when he was a
*31:21.740- 31:27.420* :  young student, so that was fascinating. My job was to kind of mine the humanity in the character,
*31:27.900- 31:32.840* :  the people that understand quantum mechanics devote their lives to it. I could conceptually
*31:32.840- 31:37.500* :  understand vaguely what they were after. But writing those equations became very soothing,
*31:37.500- 31:41.320* :  was almost like, I don't know. But you get into a rhythm, do you know? I remember talking to
*31:41.320- 31:45.660* :  Matt Damon when he was doing, what's the film where he did a good little hunting? Yeah, he said
*31:45.660- 31:52.980* :  the same, it becomes a very soothing process, just learning them. Over the last few years,
*31:52.980- 31:57.280* :  we've seen the most incredible amount of success coming out of Ireland, whether that's writers,
*31:57.860- 32:03.860* :  actors. Do you have anything to say about why you think that's happening, why now? Part of
*32:03.860- 32:08.780* :  its coincidence, and I think part of it is that our people tell stories very well. Just in the
*32:08.780- 32:13.060* :  pub to each other, we're good at it, we have a long history of it, we're comfortable with story,
*32:13.600- 32:17.720* :  comfortable with song, we're comfortable with poetry, these things are just kind of second-h to us.
*32:18.160- 32:22.180* :  But yeah, it is kind of phenomenal, the level of talent that the country is producing for,
*32:22.180- 32:28.020* :  like, five million people, let's kind of extraordinary. Killian Murphy speaking to Casey Brassol.
*32:30.820- 32:36.160* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:36.160- 32:42.720* :  This edition was mixed by Joe McCartney, and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is
*32:42.720- 32:46.580* :  Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritz, and until next time, goodbye.
