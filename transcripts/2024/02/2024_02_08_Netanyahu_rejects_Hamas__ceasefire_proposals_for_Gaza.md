*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.780* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.960- 00:24.340* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Thursday, the 8th of February, these are our main
*00:24.340- 00:30.460* :  stories. Hamas counter-proposals for a hostages for Ceasefire Deal in Gaza are rejected by
*00:30.460- 00:36.000* :  Israel's Prime Minister. If we surrender to the crazy demands of Hamas will not only not bring
*00:36.000- 00:41.900* :  to their release but will invite a second massacre, a great catastrophe for the state of Israel.
*00:42.320- 00:48.120* :  25 million people in urgent need of aid in Sudan, the verdict of the UN's top relief official,
*00:48.640- 00:54.060* :  and Republicans in the US Senate vote down a border security bill that was tied to new money for
*00:54.060- 01:00.060* :  Ukraine and Israel. First, Republicans said they would only do Ukraine and Israel humanitarian aid
*01:00.060- 01:05.200* :  with border. Then they said they would not do it with border. Well, we're going to give them both
*01:05.200- 01:16.040* :  options. Also in this podcast, I arrived in Ireland on Monday. I sit for asylum. They don't have
*01:16.040- 01:21.860* :  a accommodation for single men. They're just looking on the streets. Why Ireland is struggling to
*01:21.860- 01:28.080* :  cope with the big influx of asylum seekers? And it all goes wrong for the man who spent eight years
*01:28.480- 01:31.780* :  building the world's tallest, eye-full tower made of matchsticks.
*01:35.700- 01:41.060* :  The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken's hopes of achieving a Ceasefire Deal in Gaza have been
*01:41.060- 01:46.440* :  pilloried by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Blinken, who's visiting the
*01:46.440- 01:52.300* :  Middle East, spent Wednesday in Israel discussing a proposal from Hamas for a four-month ceasefire.
*01:52.300- 01:57.940* :  It is reportedly offering to release the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel
*01:57.940- 02:03.160* :  withdrawing its forces from populated areas of Gaza and releasing Palestinian prisoners.
*02:03.160- 02:07.840* :  Mr Netanyahu rejected this outright. His words are spoken by a translator.
*02:08.380- 02:13.060* :  If we surrender to the crazy demands of Hamas, we'll not only not bring to the release,
*02:13.060- 02:18.520* :  but we'll invite a second massacre, a great catastrophe for the State of Israel that
*02:18.840- 02:23.660* :  any of us, civilians, is ready to accept. And regarding the day after the war, I'm asking
*02:23.660- 02:32.900* :  to clarify once again, the day after is the day after Hamas, not part of Hamas, not half of Hamas,
*02:33.560- 02:39.820* :  the entire Hamas. And today I told Secretary of State Blinken that after we never say Hamas,
*02:39.820- 02:44.200* :  we will make sure that Gaza is completely demilitarized forever.
*02:45.080- 02:50.460* :  In his news conference later, the U.S. Secretary of State struck a slightly more hopeful tone.
*02:51.340- 02:57.820* :  We had an opportunity to discuss with the Israeli government the response that Hamas sent last night
*02:58.900- 03:05.300* :  to the proposal that the United States cut or uneasured, put together to bring the remaining
*03:05.300- 03:11.500* :  officers home and extend the humanitarian pause. What I can tell you about these discussions is
*03:11.500- 03:18.020* :  that while there are some clear non-starters in Hamas's response, we do think it creates
*03:18.020- 03:25.740* :  space for agreement to be reached. And we will work at that relentlessly until we get there.
*03:26.500- 03:32.100* :  Anthony Blinken, our correspondent Barbara Platt Asher in Jerusalem told James Minnan
*03:32.100- 03:35.960* :  as more about what Mr. Netanyahu's comments meant for the peace process.
*03:36.460- 03:40.920* :  It sounded like he was slamming the door shut on a ceasefire in hostage deal, didn't it?
*03:41.000- 03:46.120* :  And it sounds as if Mr. Blinken sticking his toe in the door. He just said that he thought
*03:46.120- 03:51.440* :  that there was some space for an agreement to be reached. He also didn't say what bit was the
*03:51.440- 03:56.180* :  non-starter, but I think probably one thing that he and Mr. Netanyahu were referring to is that
*03:56.180- 04:00.800* :  Hamas had said a temporary truce must eventually lead to a withdrawal of Israeli troops in a
*04:00.800- 04:06.700* :  permanent ceasefire, something that Israel has rejected all along. I think that Anthony Blinken
*04:06.700- 04:12.400* :  and the Americans, as well as the Egyptians and the Qataris, they are quite focused on the need
*04:12.400- 04:18.220* :  for a ceasefire. Mr. Blinken has called it essential, and that has to do with getting the hostages
*04:18.220- 04:22.840* :  released, the remaining hostages, but also getting a pause in the fighting so that humanitarian aid
*04:22.840- 04:27.620* :  can be brought into Gaza because the situation is so terribly desperate. And on top of that,
*04:27.620- 04:33.560* :  the Americans are very intent on trying to lay the groundwork for a more fulsome resolution
*04:33.620- 04:39.120* :  of the conflict. They have a whole formula for it, which he keeps talking about. So he is quite
*04:39.120- 04:44.520* :  determined to pursue that. We don't know if other people in the Israeli government told him
*04:44.520- 04:49.560* :  different things than Mr. Netanyahu did. Others certainly weren't as public about it or as
*04:49.560- 04:54.840* :  defined about it, but it's something that Mr. Blinken has taken in his stride anyway and
*04:54.840- 04:59.640* :  is clearly not planning to give up. Is it possible, then, that what we're hearing in public,
*04:59.640- 05:05.740* :  both from Hamas and from Israel, are their sort of maximalist positions in these negotiations,
*05:05.920- 05:11.320* :  and actually what we're not hearing about is some sort of compromise that may emerge in the coming
*05:11.320- 05:16.920* :  days and weeks. That's a possibility, yes, that we are hearing the maximal positions. I do think
*05:16.920- 05:22.260* :  that the Americans probably expected Mr. Netanyahu to respond negatively. I don't know if they
*05:22.260- 05:27.820* :  expected him to be quite so public about it, but as Mr. Blinken said, some things were non-starters.
*05:27.920- 05:32.100* :  I mean, it was interesting in the Hamas proposals, they have all along said that there needs to
*05:32.100- 05:36.780* :  be a permanent ceasefire, but they talked about different phases so that there was the first phase
*05:36.780- 05:40.860* :  which would result in the release of some hostages and the release of some Palestinian prisoners
*05:41.280- 05:46.240* :  did not require a guarantee of an end to the war. That was going to be coming in the later phases
*05:46.880- 05:51.240* :  according to the Hamas proposals with further negotiations. So they were sort of signaling, I think,
*05:51.240- 05:56.020* :  that they were ready to get started on the process. Perhaps that is where Mr. Blinken saw the
*05:56.080- 06:00.240* :  space, although he didn't clarify that. He was pretty clear, though, that he did not see a role for
*06:00.240- 06:07.140* :  Hamas in governing Gaza when and if the war ends. He's with the Israelis on that, but he also is very
*06:07.140- 06:12.440* :  insistent that something needs to be done to stop the fighting. And he was also quite forthcoming
*06:12.440- 06:17.320* :  in stressing the need to protect civilians. He talked about it at length. He said the Americans
*06:17.320- 06:22.500* :  were pressing the Israelis to do more to protect civilians and he that he had outlined steps to
*06:22.500- 06:29.140* :  increase that. I'm replete our share in Jerusalem. An American drain striker's killed three
*06:29.140- 06:34.900* :  members of an Iranian-backed militia in Baghdad, including a leader of the group Qatab Hezbollah.
*06:35.340- 06:40.440* :  The US military said he was behind recent attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria.
*06:40.440- 06:46.260* :  Officials said no civilians were killed and Washington would continue to take necessary action
*06:46.260- 06:50.220* :  to protect Americans. Hugo Bashega reports from Baghdad.
*06:50.700- 06:55.200* :  The attack happened at around 930 at night in an eastern district of the capital.
*06:55.780- 07:01.600* :  Footage shared on social media showed the car engulfed in flames. One of the victims has been
*07:01.600- 07:08.720* :  identified as Abu Bakir Al-Sadi, a senior commander in the group Qatab Hezbollah. This is a
*07:08.720- 07:14.240* :  militia supported by Iran and accused by US officials of being behind an attack on a US
*07:14.240- 07:21.060* :  base in Jordan that killed three American soldiers last month. Days ago, the US responded by
*07:21.060- 07:26.460* :  carrying out airstrikes on militia targets in Iraq and Syria. The attacking Baghdad
*07:26.460- 07:32.200* :  were raised fears of an escalation of violence in Iraq as it brings the US retaliation to the
*07:32.200- 07:38.320* :  country's capital. Shortly after the strike, crowds gathered at the scene chanting America is
*07:38.320- 07:46.080* :  the biggest devil. Hugo Bashega, the United Nations has appealed for 4.1 billion dollars to
*07:46.080- 07:51.620* :  fund humanitarian operations in Sudan. The appeal came on the same day that both warring factions
*07:51.620- 07:57.840* :  agreed to meet in Switzerland to discuss access for aid supplies. The UN says 25 million people
*07:57.840- 08:03.400* :  half of Sudan's population are in need. Sudan's conflict erupted last year in a power struggle
*08:03.400- 08:09.720* :  between rival military leaders. Imogen folks reports from Geneva. Sudan's crisis needs attention.
*08:09.720- 08:17.460* :  It isn't getting 9 million people displaced, 18 million short of food, widespread sexual violence
*08:17.500- 08:24.740* :  without support. The UN's humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffith said starvation could be next.
*08:25.160- 08:35.880* :  If we start seeing famine to add to this violence and displacement, then I think we can all agree
*08:35.880- 08:43.680* :  we have no humanity. The UN faces lack of funds and lack of access in Sudan. Many people are trapped
*08:43.680- 08:50.520* :  in conflict areas with little food or water. The UN will struggle to get the cash it needs. Donor
*08:50.520- 08:57.100* :  attention remains focused on Ukraine and the Middle East. Imogen folks, our Africa editor Richard
*08:57.100- 09:03.060* :  Hamilton told me more about the situation on the ground in Sudan. The UN has called it suffering
*09:03.060- 09:10.300* :  of epic proportions and just some examples, a place south of the capital cartoon in Al-Jazeera
*09:10.300- 09:16.440* :  state called Madani where hundreds of thousands of refugees had fled and then the rapid support
*09:16.440- 09:22.660* :  forces took over that place. So that meant that the refugees had to move on again. So nowhere is
*09:22.660- 09:29.060* :  a safe haven within Sudan. And then a couple of days ago, Medcan San Frontier said that a child
*09:29.060- 09:36.160* :  was dying every two hours in a refugee camp in North Darfur near El Fasha. It's almost impossible
*09:36.160- 09:43.000* :  to convey the suffering of the Sudanese people at the hands of these two warring military leaders
*09:43.000- 09:48.840* :  who don't seem to care about the situation that the population's in. And this is starting to have
*09:48.840- 09:54.700* :  an impact on neighboring countries? Yes, the UN is that part of this four billion dollars that
*09:54.700- 10:01.620* :  it's calling for is to help countries like Chad, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, Central African
*10:01.620- 10:07.860* :  Republic. For example, Chad, they're getting thousands of refugees every day and they simply
*10:07.860- 10:12.680* :  can't cope. It's already one of the poorest countries in the world. And the same with South Sudan,
*10:12.680- 10:18.660* :  which was recovering from its own civil war, a very poor country, is having to take hundreds of
*10:18.660- 10:24.260* :  thousands of refugees. So they're at breaking point as well. They're worried about a wider regional
*10:24.260- 10:30.440* :  conflict because you've got Egypt supporting the regular Sudanese armed forces than the United
*10:30.440- 10:36.340* :  Arab Emirates supporting the rapid support forces. So it's a complicated regional picture.
*10:36.640- 10:40.320* :  Presumably, the best way to improve the situation would be if the fighting stopped.
*10:40.740- 10:45.780* :  That, of course, would be the ideal situation. And the leaders often say, oh, we're going to hold
*10:45.780- 10:52.100* :  talks. And the latest is there's the possibility of negotiations being held in Switzerland to allow
*10:52.100- 10:56.600* :  access to humanitarian aid. But people aren't holding their breath that these are going to work.
*10:57.220- 11:03.520* :  Richard Hamilton. The Eurovision final might be three months away, but one of this year's acts
*11:03.520- 11:09.600* :  has already stoked debate online and even amongst politicians. Spain's entry, which is called
*11:09.600- 11:16.760* :  Zora, has come under fire for being anti-women. Our reporter Ella Bicknell has this look at the story.
*11:25.260- 11:30.880* :  The last week alone, the electropop anthem Zora has rocketed to the top of Spanish streaming
*11:30.880- 11:37.540* :  platforms. In fact, today Spotify had it as its third most viral tune worldwide. But the song's title
*11:37.540- 11:43.460* :  has received backlash. Zora means vixen, but is often used to mean bitch or slut in every day
*11:43.460- 11:48.140* :  Spanish. A group called the Feminist Movement of Madrid released a statement saying the song
*11:48.140- 11:54.320* :  insults women in a sexist way. But others say it challenges stereotypes, including the Prime Minister
*11:54.320- 12:00.140* :  Pedro Sanchez and Lewis, a Spanish journalist and Eurovision fan. I definitely don't think
*12:00.140- 12:06.680* :  rice and anti-women song. It is a song that comes from the experience of the singer Mary,
*12:07.320- 12:12.060* :  where she's been called that bad name many times throughout her life. And now she's using it
*12:12.520- 12:19.920* :  as a weapon against those who attacked her. Zora is performed by Nebulosa, a duo formed by a
*12:19.920- 12:25.340* :  married couple from Alicante, Mary Baz and Marta Suis. Mary, who's the lead singer, brushed off
*12:25.340- 12:30.740* :  the criticism, saying her age, she's 55, means she doesn't give a damn about anything.
*12:30.740- 12:35.000* :  The group made headlines last year when they split from Spain's main Feminist Movement,
*12:35.000- 12:41.740* :  the AM Commission over its support of trans rights legislation. Dr. Paul Jordan wrote a Ph.D.
*12:41.740- 12:46.820* :  on the politics behind Eurovision. I totally understand where people are coming from when they say
*12:46.820- 12:53.220* :  it's misogynistic and that it's insulting to women. But I would agree really with those who are
*12:53.220- 12:56.840* :  defending it, who are saying that actually it's challenging stereotypes. And I think certainly
*12:56.840- 13:01.700* :  the use of language, I think they're using it to reclaim that language, to take out the power
*13:01.700- 13:10.860* :  of those words, much in the way the LGBT people have reclaimed the word queer. Despite the round,
*13:10.860- 13:16.360* :  the song has been given the go-ahead by contest organizers, they've confirmed it does not contravene,
*13:16.360- 13:22.000* :  it's banned on lyrics, actually used to bring the contest into disrepute. So we'll be seeing
*13:22.000- 13:27.340* :  Nebguelosa and their song Zorro at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo in May.
*13:31.360- 13:37.840* :  Ella Bicknell, now good news for a pod of killer whales that became trapped in drift ice off
*13:37.840- 13:43.480* :  the coast of Japan. They appear to have escaped to open water concern for the fate of the whales,
*13:43.480- 13:50.460* :  had been growing in Japan after drone video had shown at least 10 orcas crowded together in the ice
*13:50.460- 13:57.840* :  for days. Shorn, whales, reports. The video is hard to watch, around a dozen killer whales
*13:57.840- 14:03.700* :  packed together, trapped in ice and struggling to breathe. The orcas can be seen bobbing around
*14:03.700- 14:09.940* :  in a small hole in the ice, sticking their heads out for air. The icy water appears to be tainted
*14:09.940- 14:16.120* :  red, suggesting some of the orcas had bleeding jaws. Earlier this week a fisherman reported the
*14:16.120- 14:22.000* :  whales had become stuck in ice, about a kilometre off the coast of the northern Japanese island Hokkaido.
*14:22.520- 14:27.760* :  Drone video of the whales was broadcast on Japanese TV, sparking public concern.
*14:32.380- 14:38.540* :  Unlike many other large whales, orcas can't spend long underwater, no more than about 15 minutes.
*14:39.120- 14:43.980* :  One environmental group petitioned the Japanese government to deploy an icebreaker to help
*14:43.980- 14:49.180* :  free the animals, but officials said there was little they could do to help. Orcas have been
*14:49.180- 14:54.860* :  reported dying in ice in this area in the past. But on Wednesday there was good news for the trapped
*14:54.860- 15:00.420* :  animals, officials saying they believed growing gaps in the ice helped the orcas free themselves
*15:00.420- 15:08.040* :  and swim to open water. Seas covers Hokkaido's coast every winter, but researchers say climate change
*15:08.040- 15:13.880* :  has resulted in a 30 percent decline in sea ice across the region over the past four decades.
*15:14.700- 15:21.380* :  Sean Wales. And for more ice related content you can head to the BBC News website where you can
*15:21.380- 15:26.560* :  see the winner of this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Air People's Choice Award, a stunning
*15:26.560- 15:33.160* :  image of a young polar bear drifting off to sleep on an iceberg has taken the prize. Well worth a look.
*15:35.580- 15:40.760* :  Still to come on the global news podcast. They're absolutely beautiful and quite a lot of people
*15:40.760- 15:46.600* :  agree with me. Some people don't. Can you see them from where you live? No, I can't. But I would love to.
*15:48.580- 15:55.260* :  One of the creators of the wind turbine on its aesthetic appeal and winning a highly coveted award.
*16:05.220- 16:11.260* :  It wasn't the result President Biden had been calling for. The US Senate has voted down a bipartisan
*16:11.260- 16:18.540* :  bill authorizing USA to Ukraine and Israel whilst also tightening the US-Mexican border.
*16:18.960- 16:25.220* :  Worth $118 billion dollars in months in the making, it failed to reach the 60 votes needed to go
*16:25.220- 16:30.160* :  through to the House of Representatives after an intervention from Donald Trump who's vocally
*16:30.160- 16:35.960* :  opposed to the deal. But it leaves aid to Ukraine and Israel up in the air, an issue raised by
*16:35.960- 16:41.380* :  the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan during today's visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels.
*16:41.380- 16:46.320* :  We need to move forward a package of support for Ukraine. At the end of the day, there is no
*16:46.320- 16:50.700* :  alternative to the United States stepping up to the plate and providing a level of resources
*16:51.380- 16:56.160* :  that allow Ukraine to have the artillery, the air defense systems and the other capabilities
*16:56.160- 16:59.320* :  they need. And time is of the essence in this regard.
*17:00.020- 17:05.800* :  Well, as we recorded this podcast, Congress was still in session with the Senate's majority leader,
*17:06.140- 17:11.680* :  Chuck Schumer, now pushing to separate the border issue from aid to Ukraine and Israel.
*17:12.140- 17:16.780* :  So how did the bill fall apart? Our correspondent in Washington is John Sudworth.
*17:17.220- 17:24.700* :  This process began with high hopes, Alex, that this might be a way to get a deal,
*17:24.700- 17:32.920* :  not just on the U.S. border, but on the U.S.'s international commitments aid to Ukraine and to
*17:32.920- 17:38.380* :  Israel too. Republicans had said all along that they wouldn't approve any of that new military aid,
*17:38.380- 17:42.640* :  unless President Biden enacts measures to curtail the number of migrants crossing
*17:43.200- 17:47.940* :  America's southern border. And in the end, Mr. Biden called their bluff. Democrats were licensed
*17:47.960- 17:53.400* :  to work hard with their partners across the aisle. In the end, what they drew up with some of the
*17:53.560- 17:57.960* :  toughest restrictions on migration in U.S. history, according to many respected commentators.
*17:58.780- 18:03.320* :  But here's the rub. You know, with Donald Trump now the leading contender for the Republican
*18:03.320- 18:09.280* :  nomination, and seemingly unwilling to offer anything that would give Mr. Biden the appearance
*18:09.280- 18:14.700* :  of a win ahead of that election, he's been urging his party now to reject the deal.
*18:14.700- 18:19.400* :  So having marched everybody up this hill, they've all marched back down again and Republicans
*18:19.400- 18:24.780* :  almost overwhelmingly in the Senate today, just four Republican members voting for these measures.
*18:25.560- 18:29.020* :  And so this big package, this big hopeful bipartisan piece of
*18:29.580- 18:33.900* :  work that's taken months to craft, looks like it can go no further.
*18:34.100- 18:37.820* :  There presumably President Biden would want to try and turn that on its head and use it as
*18:37.820- 18:43.120* :  ammunition against Mr. Trump. Well, of course, you know, some people have suggested that in all of
*18:43.120- 18:47.920* :  this, the Republicans have set a trap that they themselves have now stumbled into. It allows
*18:47.920- 18:52.000* :  Democrats to point the finger at them and say that everything they were calling for or at
*18:52.000- 18:55.940* :  least most of everything they were calling for was there on the table. And in the end, for narrow
*18:55.940- 19:03.800* :  party advantage, they have chosen to put party interests ahead of border security. But the focus,
*19:03.800- 19:09.480* :  Alex, given everything else you've been discussing already, is still on that military aid to Ukraine.
*19:09.480- 19:13.700* :  There is still hope in the Senate that they can separate some of those measures out from this
*19:13.700- 19:19.580* :  immigration part of the equation now. And, you know, as you've been hearing, there is real concern
*19:19.580- 19:24.760* :  that Ukraine is in desperate need of this aid, that its ability to repel Russian aggression is
*19:24.760- 19:29.660* :  already depleted. And Democrats now working very hard to see if they can find a way through to win
*19:29.660- 19:35.420* :  enough Republican support to at least keep that part of the bargain alive. John Sudworth.
*19:36.520- 19:42.020* :  For generations, Irish people have emigrated overseas. But now the reverse has happened and
*19:42.020- 19:47.100* :  increasing numbers of immigrants have been trying to make it their home. Around 100,000
*19:47.100- 19:51.940* :  Ukrainians arrived after the EU granted them temporary protection. And the numbers of people
*19:51.940- 19:58.380* :  seeking refuge in Ireland has quadrupled compared to pre-COVID times. In December, the government
*19:58.380- 20:04.600* :  ran out of options to house all new eligible arrivals. And some people strongly oppose new
*20:04.600- 20:10.560* :  accommodation. As Bob Howard reports, that's resulted in men seeking asylum being forced to sleep
*20:10.560- 20:18.160* :  intense in freezing winter temperatures. Ring's End is the suburb of the Irish capital Dublin
*20:18.720- 20:25.060* :  close to the city's port. There's a church, a cafe, a local shop and a yellow painted pub called
*20:25.060- 20:31.020* :  the Shipwright. On New Year's Eve, the pub was subjected to an arson attack in the mistaken
*20:31.020- 20:36.360* :  belief that it was going to be used to house refugees. It's one of several attacks which
*20:36.360- 20:41.940* :  have had the potential to dance Ireland's reputation as the country of 100,000 welcomes.
*20:42.800- 20:49.480* :  Hazel Chu is a Dublin city counsellor with a special interest in housing and immigration in the city.
*20:49.840- 20:55.140* :  What we're looking at is a burnt out building. To be clear, it was designated to be a homeless
*20:55.180- 21:00.320* :  home. Yet still, there were groups saying that they will be burning at them because they told
*21:00.320- 21:05.900* :  it was going to be a international protection accommodation centre to house people who were not Irish.
*21:06.400- 21:14.080* :  I arrived in Ireland on Monday and I sit for asylum. Currently they don't have a accommodation
*21:14.080- 21:19.600* :  for single men and we don't have anywhere to sleep just living on the streets.
*21:20.700- 21:26.020* :  The shortage of suitable accommodation has left more than 600 men like Joseph,
*21:26.020- 21:29.560* :  who's from Zimbabwe without a roof over their heads.
*21:29.900- 21:36.180* :  Families there are located but we are all vulnerable. Anything can happen to us. We just get
*21:36.180- 21:41.680* :  into our tents and our sleeping beds, that's it. The government has increased payments for some
*21:41.680- 21:47.360* :  international protection applicants. That's refugees who say they're in danger of persecution
*21:47.360- 21:53.460* :  or serious harm in their home country. Those who are not being housed will see an increase from
*21:53.460- 22:01.500* :  38 euros to 113 euros a week. The lighthouse, five minutes by car from the Irish Parliament,
*22:02.040- 22:05.600* :  offers support to anybody who finds themselves homeless in the capital.
*22:06.420- 22:10.980* :  Aubrey McCarthy is the voluntary chair of Tiglin which runs the service.
*22:11.120- 22:18.000* :  We used to feed maybe 20 to 40 people a day. At the moment we're feeling about 500 people every day here.
*22:18.520- 22:22.020* :  I would say majority of them are sleeping rock. Certainly since Christmas,
*22:22.020- 22:27.860* :  we've had a lot of rough sleepers. To try and house refugees, the Irish government has been
*22:27.860- 22:33.700* :  sourcing accommodation, not just in big cities like Dublin, but towns and even villages throughout
*22:33.700- 22:40.700* :  the Irish countryside. Rural politicians such as Michael Collins, who represents Cork South West,
*22:40.700- 22:46.500* :  says this is putting pressure on local services. Dr can't take any more new commerce coming in.
*22:46.500- 22:50.880* :  The school is looking for two extra rooms and they can't take the extra kids,
*22:51.220- 22:55.100* :  they should have been a cap at a very early time and look at those who could be in properly.
*22:55.360- 22:57.560* :  They'll sleep on the streets. That's no way to treat anyone.
*22:57.780- 23:02.820* :  The Irish government says people have a right to seek international protection under EU law
*23:02.820- 23:08.440* :  and international law and it's investing in more state-owned accommodation to house people seeking
*23:08.440- 23:13.380* :  asylum. Rodrigo Gorman is the government's minister for integration.
*23:13.900- 23:19.480* :  I'm looking at how we have more state-owned accommodation with our hospitals, our healthcare system,
*23:19.480- 23:26.400* :  our social care system would collapse without migrants. So if we were to sometime in the future as
*23:26.400- 23:31.460* :  a country take a decision to keep migrants out, we would be absolutely shooting ourselves in the
*23:31.460- 23:38.720* :  foot. Ireland is trying to tread a fine balance. It has EU and international obligations to house
*23:38.720- 23:43.900* :  refugees while their claims are processed and it relies on migrants from many different countries
*23:43.900- 23:50.520* :  and circumstances to work across whole sectors of the economy. But the tensions in accommodating
*23:50.520- 23:56.900* :  and providing services for them are very real, something which Irish politicians from across the
*23:56.900- 24:05.040* :  board are going to have to address. Bob Howard. Dutch prosecutors say a man arrested in Spain in
*24:05.040- 24:12.060* :  connection with a massive dual-heisted Amsterdam's skip-all airport 19 years ago is the man convicted
*24:12.060- 24:17.760* :  of being the crime's mastermind. They could not say whether a DNA test has been carried out on
*24:17.760- 24:24.860* :  the suspect but named him as Errol HV, Danny Abahart has more details. It was one of the world's
*24:24.860- 24:31.020* :  biggest ever dual robberies. An armed gang dressed as airline staff seized a hall of diamonds worth
*24:31.020- 24:36.500* :  over 70 million dollars. The consignment had been due to be flown to Antswerp, the centre of
*24:36.500- 24:41.380* :  the world's diamond trade. Many years later, four of the gang were sentenced to jail terms,
*24:41.380- 24:47.980* :  but the leader, Errol HV, was released while a lengthy appeals process played out. The supreme court
*24:47.980- 24:53.840* :  eventually confirmed his nine-and-a-half-year sentence but he'd absconded. Spanish police arrested a
*24:53.840- 24:59.080* :  man in Ibiza on Tuesday. They said he looked much younger and thinner than the photos they had,
*24:59.580- 25:05.160* :  adding they couldn't rule out him having had cosmetic surgery. The Dutch hope to extra-diet him,
*25:05.680- 25:09.940* :  many of the stolen diamonds have not been recovered. Danny Abahart.
*25:10.960- 25:16.140* :  Two men who pioneered the early design principles for wind turbines have been awarded this
*25:16.140- 25:22.620* :  year's Queen Elizabeth Prize, nicknamed the Nobel for engineering. Judges said their innovations
*25:22.620- 25:28.580* :  had changed the world. One of the winners, Andrew Garrett, told Justin Webb why he thought he'd
*25:28.580- 25:34.740* :  been awarded the prestigious prize. I got it, I think, for the last 45 years of my life. I've
*25:34.740- 25:40.440* :  devoted that to wind energy. So when I started wind turbines were five meters in diameter, now
*25:40.440- 25:45.680* :  they're 250 meters in diameter. I'm rather pleased to have played a small part in that development.
*25:45.940- 25:51.220* :  Your part is the mathematical part, is it the computer part? My abiding enthusiasm is mathematical
*25:51.220- 25:56.700* :  modeling and that's been quite an important element in allowing these huge machines to grow and
*25:56.700- 26:01.780* :  be run reliably. So yes, the turbine design, mathematical modeling of that, mathematical modeling
*26:01.780- 26:06.320* :  of the way the wind farms themselves perform and whether they're going to produce the right
*26:06.320- 26:11.920* :  amount of energy for the banks. So really, mathematical rigor applied to the whole range of
*26:11.920- 26:16.340* :  activity from the turbines right through to generation into the grid. That modeling is so important,
*26:16.340- 26:20.540* :  of course, because there has to be an economic case for doing it, economic case has to make sense.
*26:20.580- 26:25.100* :  Yes, well I think if you can imagine building something which is 250 meters in diameter and it
*26:25.100- 26:29.800* :  failing would be a very big deal. So you need to know before you do it that it's going to work.
*26:29.820- 26:34.040* :  And so we've managed to develop models which predict really pretty accurately how these things
*26:34.040- 26:37.440* :  will behave and so people have the confidence to build them and confidence. You're obviously an
*26:37.440- 26:41.960* :  enthusiast for wind power. Are you winning the kind of worldwide battle other is because, well,
*26:41.960- 26:45.600* :  I mean, you don't have to look around this country. A lot of people find them ugly, don't want them
*26:45.600- 26:50.660* :  where they can see them and yet, of course, there is no doubt at all that in certain circumstances
*26:50.660- 26:55.140* :  they can work very well. What's a state of that battle would you say? Yes, I think you're right,
*26:55.140- 27:00.120* :  that people either see them as symbols of clean power for the future or they see them as plots
*27:00.120- 27:06.180* :  on the landscape. I think opinion is moving much towards the former. People are recognising that we
*27:06.180- 27:11.480* :  need to have zero carbon generation. There was a survey done recently in the UK which showed that
*27:11.900- 27:16.040* :  wind turbines were more popular than baked beans. So I think that's a very good indication
*27:16.460- 27:20.980* :  they're growing popularity. And we also, I think we've probably, as an industry, done a very bad
*27:20.980- 27:27.220* :  job at communicating how much we're doing. So last year, 39% of our electricity in the UK
*27:27.220- 27:32.880* :  was produced by renewables, which is frankly to use a technical term gobsmacking 15 years ago
*27:32.880- 27:37.680* :  that was probably 3%. So yes, in northern Europe, we are not winning the matter, we're making
*27:37.680- 27:43.940* :  big progress. 7% of the world's electricity is now produced by wind, 39% as I said last year.
*27:44.060- 27:47.500* :  Do you think we'll just get used to them? Of course, I'm not objective. I reckon I can.
*27:47.500- 27:53.260* :  I think they're absolutely beautiful and quite a lot of people agree with me. Some people don't.
*27:53.380- 27:57.120* :  Can you see them from where you live? No, I can't. But I would love to.
*27:58.140- 28:03.380* :  But I think there is a move in a positive direction. As you can imagine, I've often had to defend
*28:03.380- 28:08.340* :  the position and people say they don't like them. So I say, okay, well, you can't be against
*28:08.340- 28:12.660* :  everything. Unless you're against electricity, you've got to be for something. So you're against
*28:12.660- 28:16.680* :  wind. Okay, so what do you for? So we need to make a positive decision about how we're going to
*28:16.680- 28:21.900* :  generate electricity. One very successful part is wind. Last year, the winners of prizes
*28:21.900- 28:26.400* :  awarded to solar energy, those two together, they're not competitors, they're collaborators.
*28:27.000- 28:33.320* :  Wind, turbine, inventor, Andrew Garrett. A French model maker who wanted to build the biggest
*28:33.320- 28:40.580* :  ever replica of the Eiffel Tower out of matchsticks has seen his dream turn to ashes. He's been told
*28:40.580- 28:46.380* :  his masterpiece does not qualify for a Guinness World Record because he used the wrong type of
*28:46.380- 28:52.500* :  match from Paris's Yusko Field. Imagine the disappointment. You spend eight years of your life
*28:52.500- 28:58.460* :  painstakingly constructing a 7.2 meter high model of the Eiffel Tower out of tiny sticks of wood
*28:58.460- 29:03.980* :  and glue. You unveil your achievement and call in the Guinness Record Book Judges. Only to be told,
*29:03.980- 29:09.660* :  you did it all wrong. The unfortunate Risha Prue realized early on in his enterprise,
*29:09.660- 29:15.680* :  so around the year 2016, that the worst part of the job was scratching off the tiny red bits of
*29:15.680- 29:21.360* :  sulfur from the heads of the matchsticks, and there were going to be more than 700,000 overall.
*29:21.360- 29:27.400* :  So he thought he'd cut a corner by going directly to the matchstick manufacturers who were happy
*29:27.400- 29:34.620* :  to supply him with kilos and kilos of matchsticks without the sulfur heads. Sadly, the stipulation in
*29:34.620- 29:39.800* :  the Guinness Rules, which you only consulted when he'd nearly completed the model, is that matchsticks
*29:39.800- 29:45.720* :  have to be commercially available, which is, obviously, weren't. And so the Guinness World Record
*29:45.720- 29:51.180* :  does not come home to France, but stayed in Lebanon, where judges have authenticated a shorter
*29:51.180- 29:57.800* :  6.5 meter tower made with the right kind of matches. Yusko Field.
*30:00.220- 30:06.020* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*30:06.500- 30:11.460* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*30:11.460- 30:21.280* :  The address is globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on X at Global News Pod.
*30:21.280- 30:28.800* :  This edition was mixed by Jim McCartney, and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin.
*30:29.240- 30:31.820* :  I'm Alex Ritson. Until next time, goodbye.
