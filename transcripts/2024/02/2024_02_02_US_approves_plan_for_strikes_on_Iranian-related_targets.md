*01:44.660- 01:51.420* :  World Service. I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Friday, the 2nd of February,
*01:51.420- 01:57.240* :  these are our main stories. The US's plans have been approved for retaliatory strikes against
*01:57.240- 02:03.220* :  Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, President Biden has imposed sanctions on
*02:03.220- 02:08.220* :  some Jewish settlers who've committed violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
*02:09.040- 02:14.220* :  The World Health Organization has issued a warning about rising global cancer cases
*02:14.620- 02:20.420* :  saying poorer countries are likely to see the current mortality rate double by 2050.
*02:23.320- 02:28.060* :  Also in this podcast, for Lewis to probably finish his career with Ferrari, it's like a dream come
*02:28.060- 02:32.300* :  trip for him. I should imagine because going to Ferrari is everything. The couple of years I
*02:32.300- 02:38.960* :  had at Ferrari was a dream come true. The seven times Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton is leaving
*02:38.960- 02:48.400* :  Mercedes to join Ferrari. The US says it's now approved plans for a series of strikes against
*02:48.400- 02:56.140* :  Iranian personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria. US officials told CBS News, the BBC's American
*02:56.140- 03:02.640* :  partner, that the action will be carried out over a number of days, whether will be a factor in
*03:02.640- 03:08.580* :  the timing. Washington has been preparing to hit back an Iranian back to militias after three
*03:08.580- 03:12.700* :  US troops were killed in a drone strike at a military base in Jordan on Sunday.
*03:13.600- 03:19.080* :  But at the same time, the US is trying to avoid further escalating the violence in the Middle East.
*03:19.780- 03:24.980* :  On Thursday, the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave his first news conference since it emerged
*03:24.980- 03:30.820* :  at the start of the year that he had cancer. He said the US would not tolerate attacks on American
*03:30.820- 03:36.940* :  troops. This is a dangerous moment in the Middle East. We will continue to work to avoid a wider
*03:36.940- 03:43.160* :  conflict in a region. But we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States,
*03:44.220- 03:53.580* :  our interest, and our people. And we will respond when we choose, where we choose, and how we choose.
*03:54.660- 03:59.420* :  At the same time, the US, which has faced sharp criticism for its support of Israel's military
*03:59.420- 04:06.100* :  actions in Gaza, has taken the highly unusual step of imposing sanctions on four Israeli settlers
*04:06.100- 04:11.960* :  who have attacked Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank. I got more on all these
*04:11.960- 04:17.480* :  developments with our US State Department correspondent Tom Bateman. There has been approval now
*04:18.200- 04:24.220* :  for strikes that would take place against targets in Syria and Iraq. These would be over several days,
*04:25.140- 04:32.200* :  a crucially that these would include Iranian personnel and facilities. Now the significance of that
*04:32.200- 04:38.400* :  is that the US has made abundantly clear it sees Iran-backed groups, and Cathayb-Hesbola,
*04:38.680- 04:45.200* :  namely as one of them, as being involved in the fatal strike the weekend against its forces.
*04:45.920- 04:52.380* :  Iran-backed Iran supplied as well. So that's why they're talking about Iranian facilities and
*04:52.380- 04:57.800* :  personnel. But what is not in this apparent approval is Iranian territory. So there is no
*04:57.800- 05:03.900* :  suggestion that Iran itself would be targeted. Now remember, President Biden has been under
*05:03.900- 05:10.080* :  huge pressure, not least from some of the most hawkish voices on Iran in Washington, namely a number
*05:10.080- 05:15.960* :  of Republican senators, to target and strike Iran itself as a way to meaningfully deter these
*05:15.960- 05:21.720* :  Iranian-backed groups. But I think now what you have is this sense of more detail really on this
*05:21.920- 05:27.480* :  way they intend to calibrate this. They think that by targeting personnel they can deter
*05:28.460- 05:35.020* :  further attacks, but at the same time not draw Iran itself into a direct confrontation with the US.
*05:35.340- 05:41.100* :  And it was significant that weather was mentioned. Basically what was being said was that
*05:41.100- 05:46.560* :  cloud cover creates a problem in terms of targeting because they say they don't want to hit
*05:46.640- 05:54.080* :  uninvolved civilians. But that to me felt like a sort of explanation as to why there's already
*05:54.080- 05:59.740* :  been a three or four day delay over any strikes taking place. I think what the administration is
*06:00.100- 06:05.280* :  doing it's in a holding pattern while it sort of fully works out what it is going to strike
*06:05.720- 06:10.820* :  and when and for how long. But at the same time it's trying to keep those voices that are calling
*06:10.820- 06:15.940* :  for more strident action, trying to keep those to some extent satisfied. So you've got the US
*06:15.940- 06:21.380* :  talking about hitting Iranian targets. It's strongly backing the Israeli military and its war
*06:21.380- 06:27.500* :  against Hamas. But at the same time the US has now announced that it's imposing sanctions on some
*06:27.500- 06:33.580* :  Jewish settlers. It is and I think what's become increasingly clear over the last sort of month
*06:33.600- 06:41.160* :  to six weeks is how irritated Joe Biden is with Benjamin Netanyahu frankly over the fact that he
*06:41.900- 06:48.540* :  see him as having failed to or be unwilling to reign in the ultra nationalist elements in the
*06:48.540- 06:55.620* :  Israeli government. Now these are people whose sort of stock and base of support are Israeli
*06:55.620- 07:02.640* :  settlers who have been involved with these attacks on Palestinians smashing up Palestinian villages
*07:02.640- 07:07.720* :  and property. Joe Biden has increasingly made it clear he's not going to tolerate that. We
*07:07.720- 07:12.840* :  already knew that they were planning these are travel bands so that those people won't be
*07:12.840- 07:17.700* :  able to get to the US. But this is in addition to that so it's talking about freezing any assets
*07:17.700- 07:23.640* :  they have in the US bank accounts. But also significantly it took about donations to those individuals
*07:23.640- 07:29.800* :  also coming under the terms of the executive order. And that I think is quite an important development
*07:29.800- 07:36.440* :  because there are lots of donations that come from the US to Israeli settlements. What this is
*07:36.440- 07:42.600* :  making clear is any money that the US team has tied to individuals that carry out attacks in
*07:42.600- 07:47.100* :  the West Bank against Palestinians that is now the subject of a prohibition in the form of a
*07:47.100- 07:53.800* :  presidential executive order. Tom Bateman. Israel has criticized the sanctions imposed by its close
*07:53.860- 08:00.940* :  ally. A statement by the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel acts
*08:01.020- 08:06.500* :  against all lawbreakers everywhere so there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.
*08:08.300- 08:12.200* :  The president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said the new support
*08:12.200- 08:19.460* :  deal for Ukraine agreed by European leaders sends a strong message to President Putin. EU countries
*08:19.460- 08:26.280* :  have approved a 50 billion euro or 54 billion dollar package of military and financial assistance.
*08:27.140- 08:32.620* :  The four-year deal was passed unanimously despite previous resistance from Hungary's prime minister
*08:32.620- 08:38.360* :  Viktor Orban. Our correspondent Sarah Rainesford sent this report from Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
*08:38.360- 08:43.060* :  This was the deal Ukraine needed and that Europe had worried it couldn't deliver.
*08:43.920- 08:49.040* :  In the end Hungarian opposition to the funding for Kiev was overcome with a mixture of coercion
*08:49.040- 08:54.940* :  and concession. In Ukraine there's relief and gratitude. I'm grateful for your decision
*08:55.020- 09:01.720* :  on the finance. Addressing EU leaders' embrassals by a video link for Vladimir Zelensky stressed the
*09:01.720- 09:08.360* :  importance of EU unity in helping Kiev. Almost two years into Russia's full-scale invasion,
*09:08.980- 09:13.600* :  that solidarity is an important counter to talk of Ukraine fatigue in the West.
*09:14.140- 09:19.600* :  It's also crucial as an aid package from the United States is still being blocked by Congress.
*09:19.600- 09:26.020* :  That was a point President Zelensky underlined. Europe today sends a signal across
*09:26.020- 09:34.240* :  Atlantic and the world that the international rules-based order will withstand all challenges.
*09:34.240- 09:42.120* :  Europe sets the tone for global affairs with its unity. But this deal is about more than symbols
*09:42.120- 09:48.660* :  and signals. It's about hard cash. With all its domestic revenue being sucked up to fund the
*09:48.660- 09:53.240* :  fighting, Ukraine's government needs money to pay for pensions and people's salaries,
*09:54.040- 09:59.740* :  even to keep the lights on here. That's also critical to maintaining domestic support for the
*09:59.740- 10:06.020* :  war effort, keeping up morale. In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von
*10:06.020- 10:11.120* :  the Line, said the deal just done proved Europe's unwavering commitment to Kiev.
*10:11.120- 10:16.860* :  We all know that Ukraine is fighting for us, so we will support them with a necessary funding
*10:16.860- 10:21.300* :  and provide them with a much-needed predictability they deserve.
*10:22.260- 10:29.500* :  And I think these 50 billion euros for four years also send a very strong message to Putin.
*10:29.980- 10:35.060* :  Officials here stress that this is a war Ukraine is fighting for the security of all Europe,
*10:35.600- 10:41.040* :  that Russia and Vladimir Putin are a threat to all. They argue the funds from Brussels are not
*10:41.040- 10:46.800* :  aid, but investment. And as the money has been promised over four years, it also offers Ukraine
*10:46.800- 10:51.940* :  a little more of the stability it needs. Sarah Rainsford in Ukraine.
*10:52.940- 10:58.460* :  Now, a quick message from Oliver Conway. Two years on from Russia's full-scale invasion of
*10:58.460- 11:03.920* :  Ukraine, we're making a special Q&A edition of the pod with the experts at Ukraine cast.
*11:04.500- 11:08.620* :  But to do that, we need your questions. So if you want to know what life is like in occupied
*11:08.620- 11:13.480* :  parts of Ukraine at the moment, whether Ukrainian strikes on Crimea at a damaging Russian
*11:13.480- 11:22.660* :  morale or what a peace deal might look like, now's your chance. Please email us at globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk
*11:22.660- 11:27.420* :  and if possible, record a voice note so we can play it in the podcast. Thanks.
*11:28.180- 11:32.760* :  Returning now to this podcast, the World Health Organization is warning the number of cancer
*11:32.760- 11:39.080* :  cases globally or rise rapidly in the coming decades. WHO experts say this reflects a growing
*11:39.080- 11:45.360* :  and aging global population with tobacco, alcohol, obesity and air pollution major factors.
*11:46.180- 11:50.960* :  They say poorer countries with the fewest resources to tackle cancer will experience the
*11:50.960- 11:56.780* :  biggest proportional rise. Rebecca Kessby got more details from Dr. Freddie Bray of the WHO's
*11:56.780- 12:03.040* :  International Agency for Research on Cancer. We estimate that there will be over 35 million
*12:03.040- 12:10.440* :  new cancer cases by 2050. That represents around a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million
*12:10.440- 12:16.060* :  new cases that we see around about today, 2022 and that that is our rapidly growing cancer
*12:16.060- 12:21.120* :  burden that reflects. Both changes in the population we're getting older, the populations are
*12:21.120- 12:27.720* :  growing, it's going to be closer to 9.7 billion worldwide by 2050. So it reflects the changes
*12:27.720- 12:33.040* :  in the population but also possibly the changes in the risk factors that could be linked to socio-economic
*12:33.040- 12:38.620* :  development as well. Yeah, this is worldwide. So what are some other factors that are leading to
*12:38.620- 12:43.680* :  these cancers? The lung cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. There are about
*12:43.680- 12:51.700* :  2.5 million new cancer cases in 2022. Length mainly, of course, to tobacco and there's a need to
*12:51.700- 12:57.140* :  control tobacco, obviously worldwide and it relates to cigarette smoking. There may be other factors
*12:57.140- 13:02.220* :  such as in China, it's linked in part to air pollution, particularly among women and
*13:02.220- 13:08.220* :  other Asian countries. Press cancer is leading cancer in women, both in terms of new cases of
*13:08.220- 13:13.700* :  cancer and in terms of deaths from cancer. So that's obviously a very important cause of cancer
*13:13.700- 13:18.440* :  in women. Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up actually because the results or the statistics on
*13:18.440- 13:25.520* :  that are really interesting. In that women from lower income countries are far less likely to be
*13:25.520- 13:32.760* :  diagnosed and certainly earlier and so they're actually a much greater risk of not surviving breast
*13:33.100- 13:38.620* :  cancer, I think, from these figures you've released today. That is correct. There is definitely
*13:38.620- 13:45.060* :  a disproportionate impact on underserved populations. Indeed, an urgent need to address cancer
*13:45.060- 13:51.160* :  inequities worldwide. We do see that some of the highest incidence of breast cancer is in
*13:51.160- 13:56.160* :  very high income countries, but the highest mortality is in the lowest income countries.
*13:56.600- 14:02.080* :  And that relates to factors in the context of disparities in cancer treatment outcomes
*14:02.080- 14:07.920* :  that there exists between high and low income countries. We need to detect cancers early,
*14:07.920- 14:13.160* :  such as breast cancer and we need to treat them early so that women can survive these cancers
*14:13.160- 14:18.320* :  and that there are certainly opportunities to do that and countries need to really invest in
*14:18.320- 14:24.240* :  cancer care. I mean cancer is now so much more preventable, more treatable, more survivable,
*14:24.740- 14:30.420* :  but it does seem as if we're going backwards and especially where there's economic
*14:30.420- 14:36.500* :  disparity between countries. Yeah, I think one of the reasons we do these predictions is really
*14:36.500- 14:41.080* :  to show how important this is. Certainly the World Health Organization is working intensively
*14:41.080- 14:47.380* :  with governments to develop finance, implement policies that promote cancer care and cancer
*14:47.940- 14:53.000* :  control. But it does need to be made your investments to really tackle these global inequities
*14:53.000- 14:57.200* :  and cancer outcomes. It's not just a resource issue. It really needs to be political
*14:57.200- 15:02.880* :  world. This is going to be one of the leading diseases that we see worldwide in the 21st
*15:02.880- 15:06.800* :  century and we need to act now. Dr Freddie Bray from the WHO.
*15:08.020- 15:12.920* :  Now the idea of ghost ships haunts the collective memories of seafaring nations.
*15:13.080- 15:19.320* :  Ships such as the Mary Celeste, which was discovered, deserted and adrift in the Atlantic in 1872.
*15:20.340- 15:26.040* :  Now a mysterious shipwreck has been discovered off the east coast of Canada more than a century
*15:26.040- 15:32.880* :  after its sank. Terry Egan reports. Gordon Blackmore was out scanning for seabirds on the shores
*15:32.880- 15:38.580* :  of Newfoundland when he saw a ghostly shadow in the water. Neither a bird nor a plane,
*15:38.580- 15:46.460* :  it instead turned out to be a ship. Not any old ship mind. This one is nearly 25 meters long
*15:46.460- 15:53.420* :  and is a mystery thought to date back to the 19th century. Here's Gordon's mom, wonder.
*15:53.860- 15:58.420* :  Come in the door and he said, mom, he said, um, do you know if any shipwreck's down on the beach?
*15:59.920- 16:07.340* :  No. Then he showed me the video and took the pictures that he had taken and I was like, Gordon,
*16:07.340- 16:12.440* :  is that wooden dowels? They're keeping it together. And he said, yes, mom. I said, well, bye.
*16:12.880- 16:15.160* :  That's probably at least 150 years old.
*16:15.840- 16:22.060* :  Caprey, near where the ship was found, is a coastal town of 350 people and used to be on a high
*16:22.060- 16:27.700* :  traffic shipping route. Residents there hope to find out more about how some of their ancestors
*16:27.700- 16:33.860* :  might have been lost in the water. Or as Gordon put it, whether there are any lost souls
*16:33.860- 16:39.740* :  still aboard. But depending on the wood involved, the ship could have been constructed entirely
*16:39.740- 16:46.260* :  elsewhere, such as in Europe. As it stands though, little more is known, neither about the ship,
*16:46.260- 16:52.920* :  nor about how it washed up. Neil Burgess is president of the Shipwreck Preservation Society.
*16:52.940- 17:01.060* :  Newfoundland really sticks out into the North Atlantic. It's battered by storms throughout the
*17:01.060- 17:08.540* :  winter from the south and from the north. We get really huge surf and swells here in the ocean.
*17:09.200- 17:14.320* :  And that's going to tend to uncover these things. The mythology with Newfoundland is that there's
*17:14.740- 17:20.040* :  10,000 shipwrecks around our shores. Nor might this be the end of the ship's voyage.
*17:20.780- 17:26.900* :  Hopefully, it would become a place for remembrance, but could instead be damaged by sea ice
*17:27.260- 17:34.240* :  or even dragged back out by the strong winds. Either way, it's likely to become a target for souvenir
*17:34.240- 17:41.080* :  hunters. Any of which threats might do vastly more damage than being submerged in the deep
*17:41.080- 17:50.820* :  for a hundred years or so. Terry Egan reporting. Still to come, a very unusual theft.
*17:50.820- 17:57.520* :  You're kidding me, right here local. What would somebody do with a polar bear? That's crazy.
*17:58.560- 18:02.440* :  Thieves in Canada have made off with a stuffed polar bear.
*18:07.600- 18:13.820* :  For just as long as Hollywood has been tinseltown, there have been suspicions about what lurks behind
*18:13.820- 18:20.660* :  the glitz and glamour. And for a while, those suspicions grew into something much bigger and much
*18:20.660- 18:25.540* :  darker. Are you a member of the Communist Party? Or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?

*19:58.200- 20:03.960* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. A new game called Power World, a violent satire of
*20:03.960- 20:09.380* :  the Pokémon franchise, has become one of the fastest-selling independent video games ever.
*20:09.820- 20:10.780* :  It sounds like this.
*20:17.840- 20:24.440* :  The gaming industry is extremely lucrative. In 2023, game subscriptions and sales combined
*20:24.440- 20:31.260* :  brought in over 50 billion dollars worldwide, drawing both music and box office revenues for
*20:31.260- 20:37.380* :  last year. Lauren Bergen is news editor at the online PC Games End magazine. She told Paul Henley
*20:37.380- 20:43.100* :  more about Power World. The Power World kind of assets core is this kind of survival game that
*20:43.100- 20:48.860* :  blends the kind of general survival elements with the creature-collecting elements that we've
*20:48.920- 20:54.360* :  seen obviously in Pokémon. The thing about Power World that makes it so unique or special
*20:54.960- 20:59.480* :  is that, obviously, a lot of the designs have been very much compared to Nintendo's Pokémon.
*20:59.480- 21:05.880* :  And I think that because when you go out into the world, you've got Pokémon, but they've
*21:05.880- 21:11.720* :  also got AK-47s, that is one of the things that made people so interested in this game.
*21:11.720- 21:16.900* :  It is the game that I don't think anybody knew they needed until they watched the trailers and
*21:16.900- 21:22.880* :  went, what on earth does this? But when you actually do play it, the gameplay is very dissimilar
*21:22.880- 21:26.960* :  to Pokémon. There's the multiplayer aspect. You can walk around the world, you can see
*21:26.960- 21:32.580* :  out other players, which you can't do in Pokémon at the minute. And just generally, there's more
*21:32.580- 21:37.900* :  of a purpose to collecting the piles, which is obviously the equivalent of the creature type
*21:37.900- 21:43.140* :  archetype. Just glancing at the graphics, I mean, the creatures involved really do look like
*21:43.140- 21:48.820* :  Pokémon characters that must be deliberate. It certainly seems that there is a similarity,
*21:48.820- 21:52.760* :  and I think that that's what has drawn people to it, and obviously it has been noticed online.
*21:53.120- 21:57.940* :  Now, Nintendo could have stamped on this from the outset the owners of Pokémon, but they haven't
*21:57.940- 22:02.340* :  had that intriguing. No, they haven't. What they have said though is recently they've released a
*22:02.340- 22:07.520* :  statement, which does not name Powerworld directly, but certainly alludes to it, saying that it
*22:07.520- 22:12.680* :  hasn't granted permission for anyone to use Pokémon's intellectual property or assets into that game,
*22:12.680- 22:17.080* :  which presumably is Powerworld. And then it does say that it plans to investigate and take
*22:17.080- 22:22.020* :  appropriate measures to address any acts of infringement upon their intellectual property rights
*22:22.020- 22:29.260* :  related to Pokémon. So they are clearly interested in what's going on, and obviously we're not sure
*22:29.260- 22:34.420* :  how long will they've actually been watching this game, but obviously with the hype and the backlash
*22:34.420- 22:38.760* :  from the Pokémon community in general, it has certainly been brought to their attention,
*22:38.760- 22:45.080* :  so it will be interesting to see where that goes. Lauren Burkin from PC Games in magazine.
*22:46.040- 22:51.700* :  Next to sport, and Formula One driver Louis Hamilton has made a shock move from Mercedes to
*22:51.700- 22:58.180* :  Ferrari for the 2025 season. If all those years of rumours, the seven-time world champion wanted to
*22:58.180- 23:04.500* :  join the Italian team, viewed by many as Formula One's most glamorous. Here's our sports news correspondent,
*23:04.500- 23:10.000* :  Laura Scott. The man from Stevenage comes across the line, wins the Turkish Grand Prix,
*23:10.000- 23:15.740* :  and becomes the most successful Formula One driver of all time. It was the moment in November 2020
*23:15.740- 23:22.160* :  when Louis Hamilton rewrote the record books behind the wheel of a Mercedes. It was his seventh
*23:22.160- 23:28.220* :  world championship title, his sixth with the team. Over more than a decade, the partnership has
*23:28.220- 23:34.000* :  brought huge success, so the news today of Hamilton's impending move at the end of this season
*23:34.000- 23:39.700* :  is seismic, but there have been clues. Ferrari have long been interested in Hamilton,
*23:39.700- 23:45.980* :  and his fortunes have changed, having not won a title since 2020 or a race for two seasons.
*23:46.720- 23:50.820* :  Yet he still believes he can achieve more in Formula One before he retires,
*23:50.820- 23:56.280* :  and the former Ferrari driver Nigel Mansl highlighted the lure of the Italian team.
*23:56.600- 24:00.540* :  For Louis to probably finish his career with Ferrari, it's like a dream come true for him,
*24:00.540- 24:05.140* :  I should imagine, because going to Ferrari is everything. The couple of years I had at Ferrari was
*24:05.140- 24:11.440* :  a dream come true. It's so romantic driving for the atmosphere of the Tifosi there in Italy,
*24:11.440- 24:15.980* :  with it all just in great limits. The most successful driver in Formula One history
*24:15.980- 24:20.960* :  is determined to move ahead of Michael Schumacher by winning an eighth world title,
*24:21.540- 24:25.260* :  and it would appear he believes he needs to move teams to make that happen,
*24:25.800- 24:28.340* :  sending shockwaves through his sport in the process.
*24:29.320- 24:35.640* :  Laura Scott. The pyramids of Giza in Egypt are one of the world's most famous archaeological wonders.
*24:35.640- 24:40.340* :  Constructed more than 4,000 years ago to house the tombs of the country's pharaohs,
*24:40.660- 24:45.980* :  they are visited by millions of tourists every year. Now the Egyptian government has started a
*24:45.980- 24:51.400* :  project to cover one of the pyramids with granite blocks. I must draw it to what it says was its
*24:51.400- 24:57.400* :  original state, but the plan has alarmed many experts concerned about what this will do to the
*24:57.400- 25:02.580* :  ancient structure, and there's been a stume of criticism on social media. A correspondent in
*25:02.580- 25:09.820* :  Cairo, Selina Bill, told me more. It's a project between Egypt and Japan aiming to cover the
*25:09.820- 25:17.220* :  smallest pyramid in granite. It's supposed to take three years. The government describes it as
*25:17.220- 25:23.160* :  the project of the century, and it says that it will make the smallest pyramid even more attractive
*25:23.160- 25:28.880* :  to visitors from different parts of the world. And once this news was spread, it caused an
*25:28.880- 25:35.400* :  uproar on social media, because people were becoming very suspicious about this so-called
*25:35.400- 25:41.660* :  restoration process. Back thousands and thousands of years ago when the pyramids were first built,
*25:42.240- 25:47.460* :  it was believed that they were originally covered in granite that was eaten up over the years.
*25:47.460- 25:55.520* :  So given this uproar, now there are reports that say that a committee will be formed that will
*25:56.260- 26:02.920* :  carry out further research and studies to see if this is a viable project, and if work can
*26:02.920- 26:08.820* :  continue on site. And can you explain to us why there's been this uproar, and indeed why
*26:08.820- 26:15.200* :  Japan is involved? Actually, why Japan is involved? This is a question that no one has answered,
*26:15.880- 26:20.340* :  but we know that they've allocated some money for this project, and generally speaking,
*26:20.380- 26:26.680* :  the government do not release much information to the public. They do not give details at all.
*26:27.380- 26:34.760* :  So the project has outraged a lot of people and a lot of archaeologists as well, because the
*26:35.200- 26:42.860* :  Egyptian government has history of what experts say messing up with archaeological sites. Critics
*26:42.860- 26:49.880* :  say that this government has already knocked down a huge number of historic tombs that some of
*26:49.880- 26:56.540* :  them are thousand years old to make way for building roads and building bridges and expanding some
*26:57.080- 27:03.920* :  infrastructure project, and they did not really care about the UNESCO-certified tombs.
*27:04.400- 27:11.160* :  So given that this is the history of this government, a lot of people say that they won't
*27:11.500- 27:17.880* :  handle the restoration process of the small pyramid with care, and some even said that
*27:18.620- 27:25.300* :  this pyramid might eventually fall, and they liken this restoration process to straightening
*27:25.300- 27:31.080* :  the peace of tower, for example, in Italy. The way the government has been justifying it is that
*27:31.720- 27:36.900* :  when the project has been concluded, it will attract even more tourists from around the world,
*27:37.260- 27:43.400* :  and for this country tourism is a lifeline to the Egyptian economy which is already struggling.
*27:44.640- 27:49.060* :  Sally Nebel in Kare. Now you might expect expensive
*27:49.060- 27:54.200* :  jury and money to be the obvious targets for a robbery, but thieves in Canada went after
*27:54.200- 27:59.860* :  something a little more unusual and a whole lot bigger as Rebecca Wood reports.
*28:00.720- 28:05.880* :  It was on a cold night in January, so cold in fact that the monitors dropped to minus
*28:05.880- 28:11.780* :  30 degrees Celsius. Most people retreated indoors to sit it out, but not one group of
*28:11.780- 28:18.960* :  hardy thieves in Alberta. They used it as an opportunity. Their destination, a resort near Edmonton,
*28:18.960- 28:27.800* :  and their target, a heavy 225 kg stuffed polar bear, called Harry. It was a theft that left locals
*28:27.800- 28:33.460* :  in shock like this man who spoke to CTV News. You're kidding me, right here local.
*28:34.500- 28:37.300* :  What would somebody do with a polar bear? That's crazy!
*28:37.920- 28:42.880* :  The thieves severed steel cables holding the stuffed animal in place before dragging their
*28:42.880- 28:48.760* :  prize down a flight of stairs and out the front door, presumably into some sort of large getaway
*28:48.760- 28:54.820* :  vehicle. Wanda Rowe, the director of the resort, says that happened on the one day it was so cold
*28:54.820- 29:00.280* :  there was no one and nothing working. It's irony, right? Stolen on the coldest day of the year
*29:00.280- 29:05.380* :  and a polar bear from central Alberta. Reportedly worth tens of thousands of dollars,
*29:05.380- 29:10.820* :  they're keen to have Harry back. Royal Canadian mounted police have asked residents to keep a lookout,
*29:10.820- 29:16.520* :  an animal that surely wouldn't be too hard to spot. He's white, more than three metres tall,
*29:16.980- 29:22.840* :  and maybe in the company of two stuffed raccoons that were reported stolen from the same place back
*29:22.840- 29:25.460* :  in August. Rebecca Wood.
*29:27.900- 29:32.320* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
