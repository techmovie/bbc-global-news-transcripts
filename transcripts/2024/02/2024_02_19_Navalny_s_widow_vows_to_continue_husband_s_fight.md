*00:37.460- 00:43.280* :  And Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 19th of February, these are our main stories.
*00:44.140- 00:49.900* :  I will continue Alexey Navalny's work, continue to fight for our country,
*00:49.900- 00:53.260* :  and I call on you to stand alongside me.
*00:53.580- 00:57.560* :  Julian Navalny has plans for opposition to Russia's President Putin.
*00:58.160- 01:03.520* :  And we hear from the only British journalist given permission to visit the Russian front lines
*01:03.960- 01:05.020* :  in the conflict in Ukraine.
*01:05.320- 01:12.400* :  Walking through these words, these tree stumps, twisted words, metal, dead bodies,
*01:13.560- 01:17.200* :  it's like the lensky said this is hell on earth.
*01:21.040- 01:25.200* :  The widow of the Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who died in a Russian prison,
*01:25.200- 01:30.980* :  has vowed to continue her husband's political fight and called on Russians to join her.
*01:31.520- 01:37.060* :  Julia Navalny has accused President Putin of killing Alexey Navalny because she said the Russian
*01:37.060- 01:43.000* :  president could not break him. She's been addressing EU foreign ministers but earlier published a
*01:43.000- 01:46.920* :  video statement which has been voiced in English by one of our producers.
*01:52.380- 01:56.960* :  Hi, this is Julia Navalny. Another person should be here in my place,
*01:56.960- 02:03.400* :  but that person was killed by Vladimir Putin somewhere in a prison beyond the Arctic Circle.
*02:04.380- 02:10.080* :  Putin didn't only kill Alexey Navalny as a person, with him he wanted to kill our hope,
*02:10.760- 02:17.000* :  our freedom, our future. We know exactly why Putin killed Alexey three days ago.
*02:17.000- 02:22.540* :  We will tell you soon, but the most important thing we can do for Alexey and for ourselves
*02:22.540- 02:29.420* :  is to go on fighting. I will continue Alexey Navalny's work, continue to fight for our country
*02:29.420- 02:36.920* :  and I call on you to stand alongside me. What we need is a free, peaceful and happy Russia.
*02:37.480- 02:42.980* :  The wonderful Russia of the future, my husband, so dreamed of. That's what we need.
*02:43.460- 02:49.740* :  That's the country I want to live in and for our children to grow up in. That's the country I want
*02:49.740- 02:57.580* :  to build together with you. The country Alexey Navalny imagined that's the only way no other
*02:58.100- 03:04.320* :  in which the unthinkable sacrifice he made will not have been in vain. I am not afraid.
*03:04.780- 03:09.240* :  Don't you be in your diet. I am not afraid. And you are not afraid.
*03:10.320- 03:13.880* :  I heard more from our Eastern Europe correspondent, Sarah Ainsford.
*03:14.400- 03:21.400* :  Well, it was an extremely powerful punchy video statement that Julian Navalny recorded.
*03:21.400- 03:27.940* :  And it's interesting to note that she did it in the exact style of her husband. Alexey Navalny
*03:27.940- 03:32.680* :  also used to start all of his videos, which were very famous in Russia. He used to start
*03:32.680- 03:37.600* :  them with a word, pretty yet high. And he also used the phrase that she used at the end of that,
*03:37.600- 03:42.440* :  you know, don't give in. I'm not afraid. Don't you be afraid? So she used a lot of his kind of catch
*03:42.440- 03:49.000* :  phrases. And in it, she made a direct accusation. She claimed that Vladimir Putin was responsible
*03:49.000- 03:54.880* :  for her husband's death. She said that the authorities were hiding his body, refusing to give it to
*03:54.880- 04:00.100* :  his mother or even to show his body to his mother. And she said they were waiting until the traces
*04:00.100- 04:07.280* :  of the latest Novichok disappear. So alleging with no evidence at this point alleging that he
*04:07.280- 04:13.220* :  may have been poisoned as he was poisoned in 2020. And of course, if there is no access to the body,
*04:13.220- 04:19.380* :  they have no way of ever confirming that. So very, very strong, but also important, I think, in the
*04:19.380- 04:24.460* :  very fact of its existence, because this is Julian Navalny jumping into the political spotlight.
*04:24.460- 04:29.140* :  She's always been the woman in the background, you know, a very strong woman, a very powerful woman,
*04:29.160- 04:34.060* :  but always very much her support and a pillar for Alexey Navalny to do his political work.
*04:34.280- 04:39.540* :  And now he's gone. She said, you know, half of me has been killed. She says, but I have no right to
*04:39.540- 04:46.100* :  give up. The other half is telling me I have to go on. And so she has now put herself very much
*04:46.100- 04:50.620* :  in a political spotlight. Putting herself in the spotlight, but is this a statement saying she's
*04:50.620- 04:56.740* :  taking over from her husband, do you think, as far as the opposition to President Putin is concerned?
*04:58.680- 05:03.960* :  I think so far as the movement around Alexey Navalny is concerned, yes, I think this is her saying,
*05:03.960- 05:09.660* :  I'm the figurehead, you know, I will continue my husband's fight. I truly believe in it. I want you
*05:09.660- 05:13.600* :  to believe in it to continue to believe in essence, continue to believe that there can be change
*05:14.320- 05:19.600* :  in Russia, that the kind of change that Alexey Navalny was fighting for for so long. She says
*05:19.600- 05:23.780* :  that very, very openly. I mean, it is a fact that within the Navalny movement, there are a lot of
*05:24.100- 05:28.680* :  important figures, but there is no figurehead. And I think she has taken on that role because she
*05:28.680- 05:33.200* :  does have that kind of moral authority. She always was so, so close to her husband. Their relationship
*05:33.200- 05:37.540* :  was very, very strong, very obviously, very loving. And I think, you know, she does have
*05:38.000- 05:42.920* :  something that others can't bring. But of course, she is in exile and she is operating in a very,
*05:42.920- 05:46.800* :  very difficult political environment, which is precisely what her husband's death has proved.
*05:47.560- 05:52.080* :  Sarah Inesford. While Israel is pursuing its war against her mass in Gaza,
*05:52.080- 05:57.020* :  the International Court of Justice in the Hague has begun hearings on whether Israel's occupation
*05:57.020- 06:04.360* :  of Palestinian territory since the Six-Day War back in 1967 is legal. First to address the court
*06:04.360- 06:10.320* :  was the Palestinian Authority's Foreign Minister, Riyadh Amaliki. Successive Israeli governments
*06:10.320- 06:19.080* :  have given the Palestinian people only three options. Displacement, subjugation, or death,
*06:20.140- 06:28.360* :  these are the choices, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, or genocide. But our people are here to stay.
*06:29.300- 06:36.000* :  They have a right to live in freedom and dignity in their ancestral land. They will not forsake
*06:36.400- 06:46.160* :  their rights. I thus implore you, as you hear the legal arguments, not to forget the Palestinian people.
*06:47.280- 06:49.960* :  Our correspondent Anna Holligan is in the Hague.
*06:50.400- 06:56.700* :  The case so far, we've heard the situation in the Palestinian territories compared to apartheid.
*06:57.120- 07:02.580* :  There's a situation, the lawyers have argued, of displacement and replacement. And this, they say,
*07:02.580- 07:08.660* :  is a deliberate campaign by Israel to try to change the nature of the occupied territory. So
*07:08.660- 07:14.960* :  another one of the lawyers representing the Palestinians has talked about the maps and shown a
*07:14.960- 07:20.780* :  series of maps, which show the diminishing of the Palestinian territory over time. They
*07:20.780- 07:25.960* :  refer to a map shown by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which appeared to
*07:25.960- 07:31.560* :  erase the Palestinian territory altogether. And they say that this is evidence that the
*07:31.560- 07:37.660* :  occupation is not temporary, and therefore by its very nature is a violation of international law.
*07:37.700- 07:44.060* :  So they're calling on the 15 top judges here at the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion, which is
*07:44.060- 07:49.100* :  not legally binding, but does carry a lot of weight, politically, diplomatically, and especially
*07:49.100- 07:55.040* :  when so many countries now are involved, 51, a record number, in these hearings. There is
*07:55.040- 08:04.220* :  a special level of importance being given to them. Anna Holligan, the tech firm Apple is looking
*08:04.220- 08:11.020* :  at a massive fine of about $539 million from the European Commission over breaches of EU
*08:11.020- 08:15.940* :  competition law. The Commission has accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming
*08:15.940- 08:21.520* :  market via its App Store rules. Our technology editor, Zoe Klyman, told us more.
*08:22.220- 08:27.200* :  In a nutshell, this is about the very heart of the way in which Apple runs its App Store. So
*08:27.200- 08:32.260* :  currently, it's changed its rules over the years, and Spotify has had a long running few for
*08:32.260- 08:35.400* :  several years with it. And although it's changed its rules, they haven't particularly
*08:35.400- 08:40.040* :  benefited Spotify. So right now, if your company has over a million dollars in revenue a year,
*08:40.040- 08:46.260* :  you have to pay 30% commission to Apple for every download that happens within the App Store,
*08:46.260- 08:51.500* :  so every iPhone user. So if you charge a pound for your app, Apple takes 30p. But it doesn't stop
*08:51.500- 08:58.160* :  there. If anybody makes an in-app purchase within that app, it also charges 30% commission. So in
*08:58.160- 09:03.040* :  this case of Spotify, if somebody's signing up to subscribe, 11 pounds a month here in the UK,
*09:03.040- 09:09.500* :  Apple takes a 30% cut of that as well. And here's the rub. You can't tell your users that they
*09:09.500- 09:14.560* :  might be able to subscribe cheaper elsewhere. So let's say you decide to offer a cheaper subscription
*09:14.560- 09:19.040* :  on your website because then you're not going to Apple and you're not having to pay that extra fee.
*09:19.280- 09:23.620* :  It's not allowed to tell its customers that. And Spotify says that this is just essentially wrapping
*09:23.620- 09:28.620* :  up the market. It's not fair that Apple doesn't offer an alternative. The only way to get new
*09:28.620- 09:34.540* :  customers is by paying Apple a cut. Now Apple says it's offering an enormous user base of
*09:34.540- 09:39.160* :  iPhone users that it couldn't access in any other way. And that it spends a lot of money investing
*09:39.160- 09:44.080* :  in protecting its systems and making sure that people can trust the App Store and that they feel
*09:44.080- 09:49.780* :  safe making payments. And that's kind of what they're taking back from companies. But the EU is now
*09:49.780- 09:54.380* :  involved saying, well, actually, we're not quite sure that this is fair. Google does very similar
*09:54.380- 10:00.140* :  things by the way, but it does allow app developers to email consumers and say, you can get something
*10:00.140- 10:04.620* :  cheaper on our website. So it's slightly getting around the rules there. So Ecliman,
*10:05.380- 10:10.960* :  it's the most important holiday in China and many other Asian communities. But the pandemic
*10:10.960- 10:15.840* :  hits spending hard during the Lunar New Year break amid lockdowns and restrictions.
*10:15.900- 10:21.840* :  Now spending has jumped above pre-COVID levels according to new figures for this month's
*10:21.840- 10:27.540* :  spring festival. The annual event is the largest annual migration in the world with hundreds of
*10:27.540- 10:32.960* :  millions of people visiting families in their hometowns. I spoke to Nick Marsh from our Asia
*10:32.960- 10:37.800* :  Business Hub in Singapore. Just to give you an idea, in this eight-day holiday period,
*10:37.800- 10:42.860* :  there were nearly half a billion trips, which means an awful lot of spending. And I think what will
*10:42.860- 10:50.000* :  be most pleasing for the policymakers in China who are navigating a very rough time for the
*10:50.000- 10:54.680* :  Chinese economy right now. They'll be pleased that the spending wasn't only much higher than last
*10:54.680- 11:03.200* :  year. It was higher than 2019. The last holiday before the pandemic, before zero COVID, and basically
*11:03.200- 11:09.980* :  before all of these economic difficulties set in. So, you know, a bit of good news amongst the
*11:09.980- 11:14.080* :  gloom, you know, whenever we talk about the Chinese economy right now. But it's interesting when
*11:14.080- 11:20.120* :  you drill down the figures, isn't it, Nick, that average spending on each trip is actually down
*11:20.120- 11:25.780* :  compared to pre-COVID times. Why is that? If you work it out per person, the spending was a bit down
*11:25.780- 11:32.440* :  compared to 2019, which suggests that people are still quite cautious, you know, about how much
*11:32.440- 11:37.300* :  they want to spend, maybe they're feeling the pinch slightly, or maybe they're just uncertain
*11:37.300- 11:43.100* :  about the future compared to what they were before COVID. And they're not really sure how much
*11:43.100- 11:49.160* :  they can splash out. And you mentioned the problems facing China's economy, which after all is
*11:49.160- 11:54.920* :  the world's second largest. Tell us more about that. There's many reasons. I think that at the heart of
*11:54.920- 12:01.000* :  it, there's a big property crisis going on now, which if you boil it down into a very, very simple
*12:01.000- 12:05.420* :  sentence, there's far too many houses and not enough people that want to buy them, and therefore
*12:05.420- 12:11.980* :  the value of people's houses has really plummeted, or it's kind of on the precipice of plummeting.
*12:11.980- 12:16.720* :  Now, the authorities are really desperately trying to avoid some kind of bubble and property
*12:16.720- 12:21.620* :  companies are in all kinds of trouble. And in China, people put their life savings basically
*12:21.620- 12:25.780* :  into property, not so much in the bank or in the stock market. They actually invest a lot in
*12:25.780- 12:30.940* :  property. So it's really linked into how much money you have to spend, you know, money in your
*12:30.940- 12:36.940* :  pocket, basically. So at the moment, things are not looking very good in China generally,
*12:36.940- 12:40.680* :  despite, you know, this latest set of data from the loon in New Year with things look like they're
*12:40.680- 12:44.960* :  going to pick up a little bit. Another set of figures which you've seen is that foreign investment
*12:44.960- 12:50.900* :  is that it's lowest since 1993. So it suggests that people outside of China aren't very optimistic
*12:50.900- 12:57.560* :  either. Nick Marsh. Animal welfare charities have welcomed an Africa-wide ban on the slaughter of
*12:57.560- 13:03.580* :  donkeys for their skin. The decision was approved by delegates at the African Union Summit in Ethiopia.
*13:04.340- 13:08.800* :  Millions of donkeys are killed each year for their hides, which are used as an ingredient
*13:08.800- 13:15.000* :  in a Chinese remedy. Solomon on Yango from the donkey sanctuary in Kenya said many people relied
*13:15.000- 13:21.440* :  on their animals and thefts of them have been increasing. From 2016 to 2019, almost half of the
*13:21.440- 13:25.620* :  population of donkeys in Kenya had been slaughtered. This is affecting very negative way of livelihood
*13:25.620- 13:29.220* :  because if somebody loses their donkey, then there's no way of making livelihood.
*13:29.840- 13:34.340* :  Our science correspondent, Victoria Gill, told me what would happen as a result of the ban.
*13:34.720- 13:39.920* :  The hope is that this slaughter will stop in Africa, but of course, that means that this
*13:39.920- 13:44.760* :  ban will have to be enforced in every single one of these member states. And this has been a long
*13:44.760- 13:52.320* :  battle for this emerging trade. So it's a very sort of strange link between ancient Chinese medicine
*13:52.320- 13:58.220* :  and the African donkey population because this is an ancient remedy. It dates back thousands of
*13:58.220- 14:02.700* :  years where the collagen and donkey hide is said to have all of these anti-aging and these health
*14:03.180- 14:08.260* :  benefits. But the efforts to supply it in China actually resulted in a decimation of the Chinese
*14:08.260- 14:14.280* :  donkey population. So this industry, as it grew, started to look abroad. And most of the donkeys
*14:14.620- 14:18.560* :  are working animals in some of the poorest communities in the world. And about two thirds
*14:18.560- 14:24.520* :  of the world's donkey population is in Africa. So over recent years, these slaughterhouses have
*14:24.520- 14:28.780* :  popped up in different countries around Africa. There's been a patchwork of different legislation.
*14:29.360- 14:34.340* :  And now public outcry, and what Solomon Onyango was talking about there, this reduction,
*14:34.340- 14:39.320* :  this decimation of the donkey population in some African states has led to this decision. So
*14:39.620- 14:45.040* :  the decision and the promise has been welcomed and it will now be down to individual African states
*14:45.040- 14:50.740* :  to actually enforce this ban. And are there alternatives to donkey skins for this remedy?
*14:51.280- 14:57.020* :  This is a really good question because the ancient remedy is embedded in tradition. It's largely
*14:57.020- 15:02.940* :  unproven, but it's culturally really significant. So there are some benefits to collagen,
*15:03.060- 15:06.640* :  but it's this tradition that says that it's got to be donkey collagen. It used to be these
*15:06.960- 15:11.800* :  special black donkeys from Shandong province and water from a special well combined to make
*15:11.800- 15:17.360* :  this remedy. And it's kind of transitioned into this global looking for donkeys to export from
*15:17.360- 15:21.820* :  different countries or to importance to China from different countries. So there are alternatives,
*15:21.820- 15:25.920* :  but of course, for a culturally significant product like that, that's difficult. What the
*15:26.200- 15:31.260* :  animal welfare campaigners want Chinese companies to do is to make their own collagen in laboratories
*15:31.260- 15:35.500* :  so they can stop the slaughter altogether around the world. Victoria Gill.
*15:37.840- 15:43.580* :  Still to come on this podcast, the conjoined twins from Senegal who defy the odds to survive
*15:44.040- 15:46.360* :  and enough flourishing in a British school.
*15:51.940- 15:58.380* :  When you see Iran close up, you realize just how complex a political landscape it is.
*15:58.660- 16:03.800* :  The global story smart takes and fresh perspectives on one big new story.
*16:03.800- 16:08.820* :  It seems that Iran's strategy at the moment is to increase the tension in the Middle East.
*16:08.820- 16:14.800* :  Every Monday to Friday from the BBC World Service. When Israel does agree to cease fire in Gaza,
*16:14.800- 16:19.380* :  Iran will then worry about Israel then turning its sights towards Iran again.

*16:25.380- 16:31.420* :  It's almost two years since Russia invaded Ukraine. So far, the filmmaker Sean Langen is the
*16:31.420- 16:36.000* :  only British journalist who have been given permission by Moscow to travel to Russian lines
*16:36.000- 16:40.360* :  and to see for himself the everyday experience of Russian troops there.
*16:40.680- 16:46.360* :  He's made a program called Ukraine's War, the other side, which is being shown here in the UK.
*17:15.140- 17:20.220* :  Johnny Diamond spoke to Sean Langen and asked him if there'd been any editorial constraints placed
*17:20.220- 17:26.900* :  upon him in exchange for access. No, I was aware at the time they were attempts to manage
*17:26.900- 17:33.140* :  to try and keep me in check, but there was never any agreements made and so I was sort of working
*17:33.200- 17:39.540* :  around the constraints. I was never actually given an official embed, so it was a case of catamounts
*17:39.540- 17:44.060* :  really. You have to say the least extensive experience of reporting hostile environments
*17:44.700- 17:50.580* :  and what struck you most about this conflict? Well, I'd never experienced anything like it in 30
*17:50.580- 17:56.780* :  years covering conflicts because the wars I'd covered, small conflict wars, America and Iraq
*17:56.780- 18:03.660* :  are Britain and Afghanistan. This is industrial warfare, which I'd only seen growing up on
*18:03.660- 18:10.280* :  programmes like the World of War. And that little snippet you heard was near Adirika, this town
*18:10.280- 18:15.560* :  that the Russians have just taken in the eastern front. Twenty minutes from a city centre,
*18:15.560- 18:21.440* :  anywhere in Ukraine you can do this, you'll be having sushi, a flat white, and a half an hour's
*18:21.440- 18:26.960* :  drive, you're sitting in a trench and squalching mud, looking across fields with all the trees
*18:26.960- 18:31.840* :  just completely devastated. So it's industrial killing, which I'd never experienced before.
*18:32.000- 18:36.480* :  Did you get any idea while you were there of the strength or weakness of Russian forces of
*18:36.480- 18:41.120* :  Russian morale? So it's always, I have to be careful what I'm saying, a snapshot of the ground.
*18:41.720- 18:47.160* :  But what I was aware was this dissonance. I was reading the Western media and all my colleagues
*18:47.160- 18:52.700* :  on that side and it's very accurate, truthful reporting. But I was aware the headlines of,
*18:52.920- 18:59.740* :  which I'd read before going out of Russian low morale, these conscripts. Well, in fact, I met
*19:00.060- 19:05.820* :  countless young soldiers who have volunteers, professional, not from the outer outskirts of
*19:05.820- 19:10.540* :  the former Soviet republics, and very professional, not these sort of prisoners we've heard about,
*19:10.540- 19:16.680* :  who are sent in as sort of cannon fodder by the likes of Wagner. So I think we've also had a slightly
*19:16.680- 19:22.600* :  fragmentary picture of the war, albeit very accurate. I mean, my own experience confirmed the
*19:22.640- 19:26.860* :  ports I've read, but they're the things you can only see when you're on the ground with the other side.
*19:27.680- 19:33.100* :  Sean Langen. For the past three months, attacks by Iranian back rebels in the Red Sea have
*19:33.100- 19:38.280* :  been wreaking havoc on the global shipping industry, leading to delays and higher prices for
*19:38.280- 19:43.040* :  consumers around the world. The US and the UK have been carrying out airstrikes against the
*19:43.040- 19:48.440* :  Houthi fighters from Yemen, and the EU has announced it will begin its own mission. But the attacks
*19:48.440- 19:54.500* :  described as retaliation for Israel's military offensive in Gaza continue. Just a few hours before
*19:54.500- 20:00.260* :  recorded this podcast, the rebels said their missiles had badly damaged a British registered cargo
*20:00.260- 20:06.060* :  ship, and unconfirmed reports suggest a US own ship may have been hit in a separate incident,
*20:06.660- 20:07.640* :  as Gideon Long reports.
*20:11.160- 20:16.220* :  November the 19th last year, and Houthi fighters land a helicopter on the galaxy leader,
*20:16.660- 20:24.480* :  a car carrier in the Red Sea. The gunmen enter the bridge and order the crew to lie down.
*20:26.160- 20:30.340* :  They take control of the ship and steer it to the Yemeni port of Hadadah.
*20:32.000- 20:37.320* :  More Houthi attacks followed, and the US and its allies responded by setting up a task force
*20:37.320- 20:41.240* :  to safeguard shipping. And then on January the 12th.
*20:58.040- 21:02.780* :  And yet still, the Houthi attacks have continued, including on ships with no discernible
*21:02.780- 21:08.800* :  connection to Israel. The disruption has been massive. Michele Visa-Bokman is principal
*21:08.800- 21:11.360* :  analyst at Lloyd's List Intelligence in London.
*21:11.680- 21:17.180* :  If you look at the straight of Bab Elmander, that's the narrow choke point from the Gulf of Aden
*21:17.180- 21:24.080* :  that leads into the Red Sea and then through to the Suez Canal. Before the Houthi began attacking
*21:24.080- 21:31.020* :  vessels in the area, you had 500 plus vessels going through that area, and that's dropped now.
*21:31.640- 21:37.860* :  By about roughly 60 percent container ships, for example, the decline has been about an 80 percent
*21:37.860- 21:42.560* :  decline. That's four ships to take the much longer and more expensive route around the bottom
*21:42.560- 21:48.140* :  of Africa instead, creating a real headache for companies worldwide. Supreme creations
*21:48.140- 21:53.260* :  is a firm that makes reusable fabric bags in India and exports them around the world.
*21:53.860- 21:56.500* :  Its chief executive is Samaruti Shriram.
*21:56.760- 22:01.020* :  About 90 percent of RC shipments that have been leaving Chennai in the past three months
*22:01.080- 22:07.460* :  have been affected by the Red Sea attacks. The demand for trying to get things out of India
*22:07.460- 22:11.980* :  has increased by about 80 percent via sea freight. So the costs are astronomical.
*22:12.500- 22:17.000* :  So how long might this go on for? After all, the conflicting Gaza rumbles on.
*22:17.000- 22:22.400* :  The Houthis are vowed to continue their attacks. The US warns of further reprisals.
*22:23.000- 22:25.440* :  Shipping companies seem to be adjusting their timelines.
*22:25.580- 22:29.160* :  Michelle Visa Bachman from Lloyd's List Intelligence again.
*22:29.580- 22:36.500* :  The realization is arriving that despite the US and UK military strikes,
*22:37.080- 22:40.580* :  this isn't really having the deterrent that governments hoped.
*22:41.080- 22:45.980* :  So we're beginning to see the beginning of trading patterns changing.
*22:46.520- 22:51.800* :  Ryan Peterson is the CEO of Flexport, a supply chain technology company in the United
*22:52.420- 22:56.100* :  States. We've now accepted this as this new status quo and the new normal that the
*22:56.100- 23:00.220* :  containerships are going to go around. The vast majority close to 90 percent are not taking the
*23:00.220- 23:03.740* :  risk of going through the Red Sea. There's nothing on the horizon to give us an indication
*23:03.740- 23:07.320* :  that that's going to change. And are we talking weeks, months, years?
*23:08.160- 23:10.200* :  Well, I think years is not off the table at all.
*23:11.160- 23:12.960* :  That report was from Gideon Long.
*23:14.140- 23:19.180* :  And now to the remarkable story of conjoined twins, Mariam and Nay, who were born in Senegal
*23:19.180- 23:25.500* :  and who now live in the Welsh Capital Cardiff. Doctors expected them to survive only for a few days.
*23:26.120- 23:31.700* :  The girls came for treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2017 when they were just
*23:31.700- 23:38.220* :  two and they remained in the UK for the care and medical expertise unavailable to them at home.
*23:38.780- 23:44.280* :  Since then, they've defied all expectations. The now is seven years old and thought to be the
*23:44.280- 23:48.860* :  only growing conjoined twins in Europe. This year, it has their story.
*23:53.600- 23:59.480* :  Mariam and Nay playing with their friends at Mansture Primary in Cardiff. Their dad always wanted
*23:59.480- 24:05.300* :  them to go to mainstream school. It's a way for me to show that they're part of society.
*24:05.360- 24:12.260* :  They don't have to hide from anybody. To see kids, to play with them, to laugh with them, to make
*24:12.260- 24:20.200* :  friends to develop as individuals. They're both so pretty. Nay's favourite colour is my favourite
*24:20.280- 24:25.400* :  colour too. That's why they took it together because they really love each other.
*24:28.640- 24:35.660* :  They may share a body, but the girls are two very different characters. Mariam is very quiet,
*24:36.520- 24:42.380* :  very reserved, introverted personality. It's completely different in a written day. She's very
*24:42.380- 24:51.020* :  independent. She wanted to be in charge of everything. When they were born, doctors in Senegal
*24:51.020- 24:56.620* :  didn't expect them to live more than a few days. They thought separation was their best hope of
*24:56.620- 25:02.300* :  survival. But when the girls arrived in the UK, it was discovered that Mariam's heart was too
*25:02.300- 25:09.920* :  weak for the complex surgery, and the decision was made not to separate them. I can't allow myself to
*25:09.920- 25:20.420* :  choose or live or will die now. That doctor, but he listens to your heart. Mariam and Nay share one
*25:20.420- 25:26.880* :  pair of legs, one pelvis, and each has a spinal cord and heart. They have regular checkups
*25:26.880- 25:32.880* :  at the children's hospital for whales. What you can clearly see here are two spines.
*25:33.600- 25:38.860* :  So this is illustrating the approximate place of where they are joined. What does anybody say
*25:38.860- 25:45.560* :  when they're going to stand on the phone? Oh, you look tall! Now the girls continue to surprise
*25:45.560- 25:51.200* :  everyone around them. At school, they spend time in a standing frame to get them used to being
*25:51.580- 25:58.880* :  in the hope that one day they may walk. We're going to leave. How long? I don't know. I don't want to
*25:58.880- 26:05.780* :  know now. I don't want to know. I just concentrate on the present and celebrating life.
*26:06.640- 26:11.880* :  And you can see a photo of the Smiling Twins on our website at BBCNews.com.
*26:13.320- 26:18.680* :  One last job, that's the catch phrase from movies where career criminals reassure themselves
*26:18.680- 26:24.180* :  that what they're planning is a final robbery before they retire to a quiet life of luxury
*26:24.180- 26:30.380* :  funded by their ill-gotten games. But in Italy, a gang of elderly alleged armed robbers
*26:30.380- 26:35.240* :  fell file of the law before they could make their getaway. Padamaguay reports.
*26:35.900- 26:40.160* :  It wasn't just the police who put a stop to their next and maybe final job.
*26:40.160- 26:46.220* :  An ongoing investigation into robberies at post offices in Rome revealed intercepted phone calls.
*26:46.760- 26:51.780* :  In one, a gang member complained that he couldn't sit on a getaway scooter because he was having
*26:51.780- 26:58.020* :  incontinence issues and needed an operation on his prostate. But after a series of successful
*26:58.020- 27:04.420* :  armed heists, their luck has finally run out in even more pressing ways. A failed burglary
*27:04.420- 27:09.660* :  in the Don Bosco area, caught on camera like all the others, has led to the arrest of the six
*27:09.660- 27:16.020* :  gang members on charges of armed robbery. All in their 60s or 70s the crew was led by 70
*27:16.020- 27:22.240* : -year-old Italo de Vitt, known as the German. He had formed going back 30 years, most notably
*27:22.240- 27:29.580* :  getting away with $120,000 from an armed hold up at a bank in the mid-1990s. Another key figure
*27:29.580- 27:35.740* :  was a 75-year-old who acted as the lookout. One got hold of replicas of backdoor keys,
*27:35.740- 27:41.480* :  two specialised in drilling holes in the masonry, often working through the night or at weekends.
*27:41.660- 27:47.220* :  Another actually carried out the robberies. In May last year they allegedly got away with more than
*27:47.220- 27:53.920* :  $200,000 in one day. But the money will not be much use now, as they will no doubt be spending
*27:53.920- 28:02.120* :  their retirement behind bars. And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of
*28:02.120- 28:07.300* :  the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in
