*02:08.320- 02:11.700* :  Even if you do argue that Putin should be given a platform,
*02:12.280- 02:14.160* :  Tucker Carlson's not the man to do it.
*02:14.160- 02:16.180* :  He's a propagandist, not a serious journalist.
*02:16.660- 02:19.020* :  The sacked Fox News host interviews
*02:19.020- 02:20.920* :  of the Russian president in Moscow.
*02:24.840- 02:26.780* :  A day before bitterly fought elections
*02:26.780- 02:29.300* :  take place in Pakistan, two bomb attacks

*02:38.820- 02:41.140* :  The chaotic aftermath of one of the bombings
*02:41.140- 02:44.880* :  has dazed survivors wander around burning bits of wreckage.
*02:45.440- 02:48.340* :  The explosions targeted the offices of election candidates,
*02:48.660- 02:50.860* :  security had been tightened ahead of the poll
*02:50.860- 02:53.420* :  with half a million personnel being deployed.
*02:54.000- 02:57.240* :  Tensions are high after the former Prime Minister Imran Khan
*02:57.240- 02:58.160* :  was jailed.
*02:58.840- 03:02.160* :  I got the latest from our correspondent in Pakistan, Sahab Aloch.
*03:02.680- 03:05.460* :  Today, as all of us were like looking at the news today,
*03:05.460- 03:08.480* :  Keelah Sefullah, which is a district in Baluchistan province,
*03:08.480- 03:12.540* :  it was attacked a party office of Jamiyat Ulema Islamfazal,
*03:12.540- 03:15.860* :  which is JUIF Zalowahir, a religious political party
*03:15.860- 03:18.500* :  in Baluchistan, their office, election office was attacked
*03:18.500- 03:21.040* :  and before that in Pishin, which is another area.
*03:21.520- 03:24.140* :  An independent candidate's election office was also attacked.
*03:24.140- 03:26.440* :  So these two came one after the other.
*03:26.600- 03:28.260* :  And as a result, there were multiple people
*03:28.260- 03:30.300* :  who reportedly got killed as a result of it.
*03:30.300- 03:32.140* :  And there were others who also got injured.
*03:32.520- 03:34.580* :  So police right now is trying to investigate
*03:34.580- 03:35.680* :  what exactly happened.
*03:35.680- 03:37.900* :  And this, of course, came a day before the elections
*03:37.900- 03:40.420* :  as people are literally getting up for the election day.
*03:40.920- 03:44.780* :  Yeah, and how tight has security been ahead of those election
*03:44.780- 03:46.960* :  given the controversy over the fact
*03:46.960- 03:49.880* :  that Imran Khan, former Prime Minister, is not able to stand?
*03:50.040- 03:52.040* :  The security is, of course, on high alert.
*03:52.040- 03:53.500* :  There were other provinces as well.
*03:53.500- 03:56.180* :  For instance, SIN province had also asked the army
*03:56.180- 03:58.640* :  to stand in the election area as well,
*03:58.640- 04:00.760* :  because they were expecting something to go wrong.
*04:01.080- 04:03.440* :  Similarly, in other areas as well, for instance,
*04:03.440- 04:06.400* :  Heberpaktunpur province, which is usually a sensitive area
*04:06.400- 04:07.580* :  with regards to elections.
*04:07.580- 04:10.780* :  There was also expected that security will be on high alert,
*04:10.780- 04:13.780* :  but interestingly and unfortunately for past one month,
*04:13.780- 04:16.420* :  Baluchistan has been facing and bearing the brunt
*04:16.420- 04:17.680* :  of all of these attacks.
*04:17.680- 04:20.820* :  So whether it was attacks by the insurgents in the area
*04:20.820- 04:23.160* :  or whether it was by other militant organizations,
*04:23.720- 04:26.140* :  where these attacks have been happening in Baluchistan
*04:26.140- 04:28.140* :  one after the other for a month now.
*04:28.280- 04:31.880* :  Pakistan is no stranger to political violence.
*04:31.880- 04:34.120* :  How has this run up to the election felt to you?
*04:34.280- 04:36.000* :  Well, last year when this was being discussed
*04:36.000- 04:37.160* :  in the Supreme Court as well,
*04:37.160- 04:40.120* :  there were political parties who did show their reservations
*04:40.200- 04:42.220* :  about holding elections at that point of time
*04:42.220- 04:44.520* :  because they were fearing that there would be attacks
*04:44.520- 04:45.680* :  on the elections as well.
*04:45.680- 04:47.740* :  But at the same time, there were others who were like,
*04:47.740- 04:50.280* :  you know, these elections have to be held only because,
*04:50.280- 04:52.200* :  you know, the establishment in the country
*04:52.200- 04:54.220* :  or the military establishment now wants to show
*04:54.220- 04:56.060* :  to the rest of the world that there is democracy
*04:56.060- 04:58.200* :  in Pakistan and they want to hold these elections.
*04:58.680- 05:00.460* :  And as far as you spoke about Imran Khan,
*05:00.460- 05:01.820* :  so yes, he's imprisoned right now,
*05:01.820- 05:04.840* :  but he's trying to run his digital campaign at the moment,
*05:04.840- 05:06.980* :  which is also facing a lot of disruptions.
*05:07.260- 05:08.920* :  Sahab Baluch in Pakistan.
*05:09.800- 05:12.260* :  At least five people have died in the latest Russian bomb
*05:12.300- 05:13.460* :  on Ukraine.
*05:13.460- 05:15.080* :  Four were killed in the capital,
*05:15.080- 05:17.820* :  Kiev, where two apartment buildings were hit.
*05:18.420- 05:19.900* :  These residents managed to escape.
*05:23.140- 05:25.220* :  Around 4.30, we started getting ready
*05:25.220- 05:28.180* :  and came here to the Metro because we had to take shelter.
*05:29.000- 05:31.320* :  We know what it is and how it's going to be.
*05:31.680- 05:34.120* :  It's not the first time, not the second time,
*05:34.860- 05:35.760* :  or the tenth either.
*05:36.180- 05:38.620* :  It's been happening for two years in our country.
*05:41.280- 05:43.120* :  I approached the emergency services.
*05:43.120- 05:45.820* :  I said there are three people on the 12th floor,
*05:46.000- 05:47.100* :  two of them are bedridden.
*05:47.540- 05:49.380* :  They're stuck inside and can't leave.
*05:49.420- 05:50.680* :  That's what I saw.
*05:51.200- 05:54.020* :  Another person was killed in the southern city of Mika Live.
*05:54.700- 05:57.720* :  Sarah Reinsford is at the scene of the attack on Kiev.
*05:58.420- 06:01.380* :  I'm standing in front of a giant block of flats here,
*06:01.380- 06:04.500* :  a really big building which stretches for a whole block
*06:04.580- 06:06.600* :  and there is an awful lot of destruction.
*06:07.000- 06:09.580* :  Many flats here are totally ruined.
*06:10.880- 06:13.660* :  What happened here was the Russian missile was flying overhead.
*06:13.660- 06:16.760* :  It was intercepted by air defenses, Ukrainian air defense.
*06:17.280- 06:20.560* :  And then the fragments landed on this building.
*06:20.740- 06:21.980* :  And people I've been speaking to here
*06:22.440- 06:24.360* :  described a massive explosion, a big bang,
*06:24.360- 06:26.480* :  and then the whole building shaking.
*06:26.480- 06:28.480* :  They say that the windows were blown out
*06:28.480- 06:30.540* :  and their doors, in many cases, were blown out.
*06:30.540- 06:32.560* :  And then there has been a fire.
*06:32.560- 06:35.420* :  And it was a fire that lasted for many hours
*06:35.420- 06:38.180* :  after the missile attack.
*06:39.120- 06:40.700* :  Some people have lost absolutely everything.
*06:40.700- 06:42.440* :  There are lots and lots of people milling around.
*06:42.640- 06:44.020* :  Hundreds and thousands, in fact,
*06:44.020- 06:45.440* :  I think, of residents of this building
*06:46.240- 06:47.900* :  have been evacuated from the building.
*06:47.900- 06:52.240* :  Lots of people looking just bewildered and lost and destroyed.
*06:52.240- 06:55.260* :  People hugging each other, plenty of people in tears.
*06:55.520- 06:57.440* :  And people were wandering around with small children,
*06:57.440- 07:00.000* :  with dogs, with little bags of possessions.
*07:00.000- 07:02.140* :  And I think they could bring out with them.
*07:02.660- 07:04.320* :  But as I say, many have lost everything.
*07:04.340- 07:06.740* :  And people are still pretty shocked.
*07:06.740- 07:08.740* :  Because this is key, if this is the capital.
*07:08.740- 07:10.300* :  And it really is a reminder of the fact
*07:10.300- 07:12.620* :  that the danger, the risk is very real
*07:12.800- 07:14.800* :  right across this country, every time
*07:14.800- 07:16.900* :  Russia launches missiles in this direction.
*07:17.480- 07:18.820* :  Sarah Reinsford in Ukraine.
*07:19.640- 07:23.880* :  The synthetic opioid fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin.
*07:24.460- 07:26.080* :  And was responsible for tens of thousands
*07:26.080- 07:28.960* :  of overdose deaths in the United States last year.
*07:29.440- 07:30.920* :  Relatively easy to produce.
*07:31.420- 07:32.900* :  It smuggled in large quantities
*07:32.900- 07:34.760* :  across the Mexico-U.S. border.
*07:35.360- 07:37.380* :  But it's also a problem in Mexico itself.
*07:37.380- 07:40.220* :  Last week, the Mexican president said he was introducing
*07:40.220- 07:42.760* :  a new law to make it illegal to take fentanyl.
*07:43.020- 07:45.600* :  But it may be too late for border cities like Tejuana,
*07:46.040- 07:48.780* :  as our correspondent in Mexico will grant reports.
*07:53.120- 07:56.120* :  Tejuana's fire service hasn't had a quiet night in months.
*07:59.020- 08:01.460* :  Around one in the morning on a freezing winter night,
*08:01.460- 08:04.460* :  they're called out to La Pelle, a local bar.
*08:05.200- 08:06.680* :  But there's no glazed put out.
*08:08.920- 08:10.560* :  Rather, they're tackling another crisis
*08:10.800- 08:13.660* :  spreading through the city-like wildfire fentanyl.
*08:17.700- 08:19.360* :  At the bar, two men are unconscious,
*08:19.360- 08:21.920* :  apparently clinging to life by a thread.
*08:22.580- 08:24.460* :  The paramedics administer Narcan,
*08:24.460- 08:27.320* :  the most effective drug to reverse a fentanyl overdose.
*08:28.260- 08:31.120* :  The men may not have even realized they were taking fentanyl.
*08:31.560- 08:33.340* :  As it's so cheap and so powerful,
*08:33.840- 08:36.060* :  the Mexican cartels have started to cut it
*08:36.060- 08:38.060* :  into recreational drugs like cocaine.
*08:41.260- 08:42.900* :  Recently, though, Mexico's president,
*08:42.900- 08:44.520* :  and that his Manuel López Obrador,
*08:44.760- 08:46.160* :  denied the problem even exists.
*08:50.440- 08:51.900* :  We don't produce fentanyl here.
*08:51.900- 08:54.520* :  We don't consume fentanyl here, he said,
*08:54.960- 08:58.140* :  urging the U.S. to take care of the problem on its side
*08:58.140- 08:58.680* :  at the border.
*09:02.720- 09:04.800* :  The state forensic service disagrees.
*09:05.340- 09:08.500* :  In a study on all of the bodies which enter Tijuana's morgue,
*09:08.960- 09:12.740* :  last July, they found a staggering one in three contained fentanyl.
*09:16.020- 09:18.640* :  Preven Casar is a harm reduction center in Tijuana,
*09:18.640- 09:22.000* :  which runs a needle exchange and other services for addicts.
*09:22.240- 09:24.300* :  So this is the vial, this is what it came in.
*09:24.340- 09:26.440* :  The heroin or the drugs came in.
*09:26.900- 09:27.140* :  Office.
*09:27.740- 09:29.080* :  In front of me, it's director,
*09:29.360- 09:31.620* :  Lili Pachecov selected two used needles
*09:31.620- 09:34.160* :  and two used drug vials at random.
*09:34.840- 09:36.920* :  All four pieces of drug paraphernalia
*09:36.920- 09:38.560* :  tested positive for fentanyl.
*09:38.760- 09:40.760* :  The border is flooded with it, she says.
*09:43.860- 09:46.060* :  It's a lack of recognition of this reality.
*09:46.840- 09:48.060* :  Of course, fentanyl exists.
*09:48.800- 09:50.520* :  I know the president said it doesn't,
*09:50.520- 09:52.660* :  but we have the evidence right here.
*09:53.320- 09:55.780* :  All those who've died from fentanyl overdozes
*09:55.780- 09:57.500* :  are part of that evidence, too.
*09:58.080- 09:59.800* :  Ignoring the problem won't solve it.
*10:00.000- 10:01.600* :  People will keep dying from this.
*10:04.820- 10:07.400* :  The roughest part of Tijuana is around the city's canal,
*10:07.860- 10:08.680* :  where homeless people,
*10:08.680- 10:11.080* :  including many recently deported migrants,
*10:11.080- 10:13.860* :  make shelter under bridges and in storm drains.
*10:14.560- 10:17.400* :  The mental health and drug addiction problems here are rife.
*10:18.240- 10:21.500* :  Iuma, a recovering heroin addict who grew up in the US
*10:21.500- 10:23.760* :  but lives in a tent on Tijuana's streets,
*10:24.480- 10:26.880* :  says fentanyl has made a bad situation worse.
*10:26.880- 10:30.280* :  It's mixed on crystal, it's mixed on everything.
*10:30.700- 10:31.400* :  You don't know me.
*10:31.820- 10:33.440* :  You put a little dose on it,
*10:33.780- 10:36.760* :  and they killed me because they haven't used that for it.
*10:37.300- 10:40.200* :  Overdozes, I imagine you see them all the time.
*10:40.500- 10:40.840* :  Every day.
*10:41.800- 10:42.260* :  Every day.
*10:42.740- 10:44.300* :  I try to save their lives when I can,
*10:44.460- 10:46.720* :  but sometimes they call me when it's too late.
*10:51.480- 10:52.660* :  Back at La Pertula Bar,
*10:52.860- 10:54.620* :  it took three doses of Narcan,
*10:54.780- 10:57.240* :  but the paramedics managed to bring one of the two men
*10:57.240- 10:58.320* :  back from the brink.
*10:58.780- 11:00.660* :  His friend, however, wasn't so fortunate.
*11:01.480- 11:03.720* :  He died amid the beer bottles and empty glasses
*11:03.720- 11:04.940* :  on the bar in full.
*11:08.940- 11:11.240* :  His family, including his mother, has arrived
*11:11.240- 11:12.460* :  and been told the news.
*11:13.200- 11:16.820* :  At 27, he's another victim of this most potent of Narcotics,
*11:17.540- 11:20.200* :  the latest young person to overdose on fentanyl
*11:20.400- 11:21.860* :  without even knowing he was taking.
*11:22.780- 11:26.520* :  Well, Grant's reporting from Mexico.
*11:27.400- 11:30.020* :  In 2022, a young American computer program
*11:30.020- 11:32.100* :  called Jack Sweeney rose to fame,
*11:32.100- 11:34.640* :  tracking the flight paths of the private jets
*11:34.640- 11:36.060* :  belonging to billionaires,
*11:36.520- 11:38.660* :  posting the routes and estimated carbon emissions
*11:38.660- 11:39.500* :  of each journey.
*11:39.960- 11:43.540* :  It led to a rower with Tesla and ex-Boss Elon Musk.
*11:44.280- 11:46.980* :  Now, Mr. Sweeney is focusing on Taylor Swift's plane,
*11:46.980- 11:48.660* :  and she is not happy.
*11:49.280- 11:51.820* :  A recent post shows a journey of just 45 kilometers
*11:51.820- 11:54.800* :  across the city of St. Louis that took 13 minutes
*11:55.280- 11:58.380* :  and produced 0.8 tons of carbon dioxide.
*11:59.020- 12:00.460* :  Lawyers representing the pop star
*12:00.460- 12:02.880* :  have sent two cease and desist letters
*12:02.880- 12:04.400* :  citing security concerns.
*12:05.040- 12:07.160* :  Our cyber correspondent, Joe Tidy, told me
*12:07.160- 12:09.020* :  how Jack Sweeney tracks private jets.
*12:09.700- 12:12.420* :  He uses publicly available information, mostly,
*12:12.940- 12:15.280* :  from the likes of the Federal Aviation Administration
*12:15.360- 12:19.400* :  in the US, whereby if you have the tracker number
*12:19.400- 12:22.540* :  for a plane, you can put it into the database,
*12:22.540- 12:25.640* :  and it'll tell you details about exactly how
*12:25.640- 12:27.380* :  to get the transponder number.
*12:27.380- 12:30.820* :  And then you would put that into something like flight radar,
*12:31.140- 12:33.060* :  which monitors the taking off and flights
*12:33.060- 12:35.240* :  and landings of planes around the world.
*12:35.780- 12:37.120* :  And that's how he does it.
*12:37.240- 12:38.640* :  And lots of other places do this as well.
*12:38.640- 12:41.120* :  He is, by far, the most famous and most successful one
*12:41.120- 12:44.100* :  of these celebrity jet tracking services.
*12:44.920- 12:47.240* :  But he also has to use some information
*12:47.300- 12:49.380* :  that isn't as easily attainable.
*12:49.460- 12:51.060* :  So for example, there are some people,
*12:51.660- 12:53.800* :  including Taylor Swift, who have managed to get the flight
*12:53.800- 12:55.660* :  number and the transponder details taken off
*12:55.660- 12:57.180* :  the publicly available database.
*12:57.760- 13:01.100* :  But using a bit of slew thing and sort of hobbyist aviation
*13:01.100- 13:04.340* :  experts, they can pretty quickly work out whose flight,
*13:04.340- 13:06.500* :  whose jets are whose, for example,
*13:07.040- 13:09.100* :  looking at Taylor Swift's tour details,
*13:09.100- 13:10.720* :  where she will be in certain cities
*13:10.720- 13:11.980* :  around the world at certain points,
*13:11.980- 13:13.860* :  and they can kind of put the two and two together.
*13:14.240- 13:16.340* :  And that's how they get the information to track the jets.
*13:16.740- 13:19.080* :  So it doesn't sound like he's doing anything illegal.
*13:19.080- 13:20.880* :  What is Taylor Swift's problem?
*13:21.500- 13:23.200* :  Well, they're saying it's a security risk.
*13:23.200- 13:25.620* :  They're saying that this is allowing people
*13:25.620- 13:27.280* :  that want to get close to Taylor Swift
*13:27.360- 13:29.340* :  to know exactly where she is at any one time.
*13:29.820- 13:32.680* :  He says that he's posting the details and the data later,
*13:33.120- 13:34.740* :  so like a day after the event.
*13:34.740- 13:37.580* :  So it's not saying exactly where she is at any one time.
*13:37.920- 13:39.960* :  And of course, it only tells you where she's landing
*13:39.960- 13:41.880* :  and taking off and it doesn't tell you where she will go
*13:42.220- 13:42.720* :  after that.
*13:43.100- 13:44.520* :  But Taylor Swift is, of course,
*13:44.520- 13:46.020* :  one of the most famous people in the world,
*13:46.020- 13:48.360* :  one of the most sought after by her fans.
*13:48.920- 13:51.920* :  And there have been cases of some sinister behavior.
*13:51.920- 13:53.220* :  So there was someone arrested
*13:53.880- 13:56.000* :  and is facing charges for stalking, for example,
*13:56.000- 13:56.880* :  in the last few months,
*13:57.260- 13:58.620* :  after they were found outside her house.
*13:58.860- 14:01.460* :  Yeah, and I guess they could use this kind of information
*14:01.520- 14:02.980* :  to find out where she is.
*14:02.980- 14:05.920* :  But what kind of laws might deal with this?
*14:06.440- 14:07.840* :  Well, I don't think there is anything
*14:07.840- 14:09.360* :  that deals with this currently, because of course,
*14:09.720- 14:11.300* :  he's been doing this for a couple of years.
*14:11.300- 14:12.660* :  Most famously before this,
*14:12.660- 14:14.140* :  it was Elon Musk, he had a big row
*14:14.140- 14:16.260* :  with Musk on the platform,
*14:17.020- 14:18.580* :  formerly known as Twitter, on X.
*14:19.020- 14:22.000* :  And nothing was done in terms of, you know, stopping him.
*14:22.220- 14:24.480* :  It seems to me that the way that he is being
*14:24.480- 14:26.360* :  policed right now is by social networks.
*14:27.000- 14:29.960* :  So for example, X took his account down,
*14:30.080- 14:31.800* :  so he wasn't able to post on there anymore
*14:31.800- 14:33.660* :  about where Elon Musk jet is.
*14:34.100- 14:35.300* :  But then I'm looking at it now,
*14:35.300- 14:37.700* :  but on Instagram, Elon Musk jet.
*14:37.840- 14:39.760* :  And that's got 50,000 followers.
*14:39.760- 14:40.940* :  So there are some social networks
*14:41.440- 14:43.400* :  that do allow these profiles to stay up.
*14:43.980- 14:46.040* :  Our cyber-correspondent Joe Tidey.
*14:48.180- 14:50.040* :  Still to come on the global news podcast?
*14:50.040- 14:53.240* :  Most people that come here don't have any
*14:53.700- 14:54.940* :  haven't had the food before,
*14:55.360- 14:58.940* :  but people could see bits that remind them of themselves.
*14:59.520- 15:01.040* :  The first black woman in the UK
*15:01.040- 15:03.620* :  to secure a Michelin star on how everyone
*15:03.620- 15:05.960* :  can identify with West African cooking.
*15:09.580- 15:10.980* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right?
*15:11.920- 15:14.400* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*15:14.960- 15:17.800* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star
*15:17.800- 15:18.980* :  in all the world.
*15:19.640- 15:22.060* :  But something happened, not just to him,
*15:22.680- 15:24.620* :  but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
*15:25.160- 15:28.100* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.
*15:29.100- 15:31.580* :  I'm Una Chaplin, and from CBC podcasts
*15:31.820- 15:33.380* :  and the BBC World Service,
*15:33.740- 15:35.520* :  this is Hollywood Exiles.
*15:36.200- 15:39.860* :  Search for Hollywood Exiles, wherever you get your podcasts.
*15:44.640- 15:48.240* :  At Airbus, our products make the world a safer place
*15:48.700- 15:50.960* :  and help nations protect their sovereignty,
*15:52.260- 15:54.500* :  whether it's air ambulance services at home
*15:55.340- 15:57.200* :  or evacuations overseas.
*15:57.960- 16:00.020* :  Our technology protects citizens,
*16:00.140- 16:04.120* :  safeguard security, and aids responses to crises.

*16:14.860- 16:18.120* :  Hi, I'm Danny Pellegrino from the Everything Iconic podcast,
*16:18.560- 16:22.540* :  and who doesn't love a classic burger from McDonald's?
*16:22.580- 16:24.620* :  That's right, McDonald's classic burgers are hotter,
*16:24.620- 16:26.420* :  juicier, and tastier than ever.
*16:26.700- 16:28.780* :  The patties are cooked to juicy perfection.
*16:28.780- 16:32.140* :  I love the cheese perfectly melted on top.
*16:32.140- 16:36.460* :  I love the big Mac that has special sauce in every bite.
*16:36.460- 16:38.940* :  I love the pillowy soft golden bun.
*16:38.940- 16:40.540* :  So in the words of the hamburger,
*16:41.100- 16:44.460* :  which I believe means grab McDonald's best burgers ever
*16:44.460- 16:47.180* :  before Hamburger does at a McDonald's near you.
*16:51.220- 16:53.240* :  On the latest stop of his Middle East tour,
*16:53.240- 16:55.540* :  the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*16:55.900- 16:57.220* :  has met the Israeli president.
*16:57.820- 16:59.960* :  He said he was hoping that Hamas and Israel
*16:59.960- 17:02.860* :  would agree a deal to free the hostages in Gaza
*17:03.260- 17:05.080* :  in return for pause in the fighting,
*17:05.080- 17:07.420* :  but he said there was still a lot of work to be done.
*17:08.000- 17:10.640* :  Earlier, the Katari mediator said Hamas
*17:10.640- 17:14.520* :  had responded positively to US Israeli proposals for a deal.
*17:15.200- 17:18.480* :  The Palestinian group has counted with a three-stage ceasefire
*17:18.480- 17:20.020* :  plan, and for more details,
*17:20.020- 17:22.640* :  we heard from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Nick Beak.
*17:23.220- 17:25.680* :  It's worth looking at what the Reuters news agency
*17:25.680- 17:27.940* :  have been reporting in the last couple of hours,
*17:27.940- 17:31.040* :  because they say they've seen a copy or certainly a draft
*17:31.040- 17:34.240* :  of what are really Hamas' counter proposals.
*17:34.300- 17:37.720* :  So last night we had Hamas a senior figure telling the BBC
*17:37.720- 17:40.640* :  that they'd put forward in his words a positive vision
*17:41.100- 17:45.240* :  of how a peace framework could basically be brought into effect.
*17:45.240- 17:48.820* :  And what Reuters are saying is that within the Hamas plans,
*17:48.940- 17:50.460* :  there would be three phases,
*17:50.460- 17:52.940* :  and each one would be 45 days long.
*17:53.300- 17:55.800* :  So if this were to come into being, it's a big if,
*17:56.120- 17:59.160* :  there would be quite a sustained lull in the fighting,
*17:59.160- 18:02.140* :  which it would hope would lead to a permanent ceasefire.
*18:02.360- 18:05.760* :  And what Hamas are saying is that in the first 45 days,
*18:06.160- 18:09.120* :  hostages that were taken on October 7th
*18:09.120- 18:11.780* :  would be released specifically the women and children.
*18:11.780- 18:14.760* :  Then there would be another 45-day period
*18:14.760- 18:17.100* :  in which other hostages were released.
*18:17.100- 18:20.680* :  And then finally, the remains of hostages who have died
*18:20.680- 18:24.880* :  would be released in the third phase of 45 days.
*18:25.520- 18:26.400* :  For this to happen,
*18:26.440- 18:30.520* :  Hamas are talking about the release of 1,500 Palestinian
*18:30.520- 18:32.220* :  prisoners in Israeli jails.
*18:32.220- 18:34.980* :  So this is the first time we've got a specific figure.
*18:35.360- 18:38.580* :  And within that, the talk is of 500 prisoners
*18:39.120- 18:42.140* :  who have been given life sentences by Israel.
*18:42.140- 18:44.740* :  So clearly, there is a lot in this.
*18:44.740- 18:46.880* :  The caveat is that this is a draft.
*18:46.880- 18:48.120* :  It's being reported,
*18:48.480- 18:50.200* :  but I think that the fundamental position
*18:50.200- 18:51.580* :  which is difficult at the moment
*18:51.580- 18:54.040* :  is that Hamas is saying that for this to happen,
*18:54.060- 18:57.940* :  Israeli troops have to be withdrawn completely from Gaza.
*18:58.180- 19:00.180* :  And Israel is saying that simply isn't going to happen.
*19:00.500- 19:01.680* :  Nick Beak in Jerusalem,
*19:02.600- 19:05.880* :  according to a preliminary report from US investigators,
*19:06.380- 19:11.140* :  a door panel that flew off from a Boeing 737 MAX jet
*19:11.140- 19:14.300* :  in mid-air appeared to be missing four bolts.
*19:14.880- 19:17.040* :  The incident on an Alaskan airline flight
*19:17.040- 19:18.980* :  led to the grounding of all MAX jets.
*19:19.640- 19:22.060* :  Replying to the report, Boeing said it was accountable
*19:22.060- 19:24.580* :  and is implementing a comprehensive plan
*19:24.580- 19:27.220* :  to strengthen quality and confidence.
*19:27.760- 19:30.400* :  Our international business correspondent Theo Leggett
*19:30.580- 19:31.600* :  spoke to Nigel Adely.
*19:32.280- 19:34.220* :  Well, this was an aircraft that was taking off
*19:34.220- 19:36.900* :  from Portland International Airport in Oregon
*19:37.160- 19:38.240* :  in early January.
*19:38.240- 19:39.980* :  And shortly after takeoff,
*19:40.560- 19:42.840* :  a panel which was used to cover up
*19:42.840- 19:46.520* :  an unused emergency exit door blew out of the aircraft.
*19:46.520- 19:48.820* :  Suddenly, there was a large hole in the aircraft.
*19:48.820- 19:50.500* :  All the air was rushing out.
*19:51.080- 19:52.400* :  Nobody was seriously injured,
*19:52.400- 19:56.000* :  but clearly people within the aircraft were very badly shocked.
*19:56.740- 20:00.080* :  And the issue here is that if that same accident happened
*20:00.640- 20:01.680* :  at a higher altitude,
*20:01.680- 20:04.020* :  when people were not strapped into their seats
*20:04.020- 20:06.420* :  and when the pressure differential between outside
*20:06.420- 20:08.420* :  the aircraft and inside was that much greater,
*20:08.920- 20:10.880* :  it could have been an absolute tragedy.
*20:10.880- 20:12.580* :  So what does the report say?
*20:13.360- 20:15.060* :  Well, this is the preliminary report
*20:15.060- 20:17.880* :  from the US National Transportation Safety Board.
*20:18.080- 20:20.400* :  It says that this plug in the fuselage,
*20:20.580- 20:24.140* :  which would normally be bolted securely in place,
*20:24.520- 20:28.820* :  does not appear to have had four essential retaining bolts fitted.
*20:29.440- 20:31.520* :  Now, this door plug was installed
*20:31.520- 20:34.160* :  by Boeing's contractor spirit aerosystems
*20:34.480- 20:37.100* :  in sections of fuselage that were then shipped to Boeing
*20:37.100- 20:39.980* :  for assembly in its plans in Washington state.
*20:40.600- 20:43.260* :  But at some point, that door plug was removed.
*20:43.800- 20:46.520* :  It had a manufacturing defect that had to be rectified.
*20:46.760- 20:49.300* :  And when it was put back, photographic evidence
*20:49.300- 20:52.560* :  suggests that those bolts were not installed again.
*20:53.000- 20:55.320* :  And this is backed up by the damage to the door
*20:55.320- 20:56.140* :  and its surroundings.
*20:56.780- 20:58.640* :  And questions are already being asked
*20:58.980- 21:00.880* :  about Boeing's manufacturing processes.
*21:01.460- 21:04.260* :  This will make the spotlight that's shining on the company
*21:04.980- 21:05.660* :  even harsher.
*21:06.240- 21:09.280* :  And of course, for Boeing, it is immensely embarrassing
*21:09.280- 21:12.920* :  and could have reputational damage as well.
*21:12.920- 21:16.400* :  But fundamentally, this is something that we often take
*21:16.400- 21:17.720* :  for granted when we go on a plane
*21:17.720- 21:20.320* :  that this sort of thing will be taken care of.
*21:21.040- 21:21.980* :  That's absolutely correct.
*21:21.980- 21:25.440* :  But this is where concerns over the 737 MAX,
*21:25.440- 21:28.520* :  this particular type of aircraft come in.
*21:28.980- 21:32.520* :  Because this aircraft, which is a relatively new version
*21:32.520- 21:35.920* :  of a very old aircraft, already has a checkered safety record.
*21:36.400- 21:39.860* :  Five years ago, 2737 MAX crashed
*21:39.980- 21:42.880* :  because they'd had flight control software installed
*21:42.880- 21:45.280* :  that was badly designed and which
*21:45.280- 21:48.020* :  counter-mandered the actions of the pilots and malfunctioned
*21:48.180- 21:50.000* :  and it drove those aircraft into the ground.
*21:50.720- 21:53.760* :  So there have been questions ever since about the way
*21:53.760- 21:55.600* :  in which this aircraft was certified
*21:56.100- 21:58.060* :  and whether it was fit for purpose.
*21:58.060- 22:01.480* :  Now, Boeing has always insisted that it's cleaned up its act,
*22:01.480- 22:03.520* :  that its main focus is on safety
*22:04.020- 22:06.880* :  and that there is nothing wrong with the 737 MAX now.
*22:06.880- 22:10.240* :  But what this incident illustrates or reinforces
*22:10.700- 22:13.340* :  is concerns that conditions and Boeing's factories
*22:14.160- 22:16.980* :  simply aren't good enough, but it's not putting enough effort
*22:17.520- 22:20.320* :  into quality control and that its main suppliers,
*22:20.320- 22:23.280* :  spirit error systems, is also making mistakes.
*22:23.280- 22:25.360* :  And there have been other problems on the production line.
*22:25.700- 22:27.560* :  It'll focus attention not only on Boeing,
*22:28.000- 22:29.600* :  but also on the U.S. regulator,
*22:29.600- 22:31.300* :  the Federal Aviation Administration,
*22:31.760- 22:33.540* :  which is supposed to oversee Boeing
*22:33.540- 22:36.260* :  and make sure that every aircraft leaving its factories
*22:36.800- 22:38.760* :  is as safe as it can possibly be.
*22:38.980- 22:41.080* :  Our business correspondent, Theo Leggett.
*22:41.560- 22:44.240* :  The Sankt Fox News host, Tucker Carlson,
*22:44.240- 22:47.320* :  has popped up in Moscow, where he's become the first Western
*22:47.320- 22:49.200* :  journalist to interview Vladimir Putin
*22:49.560- 22:51.000* :  since the war in Ukraine began.
*22:51.220- 22:54.100* :  The right-wing media personality has drawn accusations.
*22:54.220- 22:56.200* :  He's acting as a propaganda tool
*22:56.200- 22:59.160* :  for the Russian president, who he has frequently defended.
*22:59.820- 23:02.680* :  Russian media say Carlson, quote, speaks the truth.
*23:03.360- 23:06.020* :  In a video post, Tucker Carlson defended the interview.
*23:06.680- 23:07.620* :  Here's what we're doing it.
*23:08.080- 23:10.480* :  First, because it's our job, we're in journalism.
*23:11.060- 23:13.020* :  Our duty is to inform people.
*23:13.640- 23:16.620* :  Two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world,
*23:17.160- 23:19.020* :  most Americans are not informed.
*23:19.020- 23:22.000* :  They have no real idea what's happening in this region.
*23:22.020- 23:25.200* :  Here in Russia, or 600 miles away, in Ukraine.
*23:25.220- 23:26.520* :  But they should know.
*23:27.020- 23:28.460* :  They're paying for much of it
*23:28.920- 23:30.720* :  in ways they might not fully yet perceive.
*23:31.460- 23:34.140* :  Christopher Steele is a former British intelligence officer
*23:34.140- 23:35.740* :  and an expert on Russia.
*23:36.300- 23:38.580* :  He spoke to Justin Webb about what impact
*23:38.580- 23:40.560* :  the controversial interview might have.
*23:41.340- 23:44.280* :  I think it will add fuel to what is effectively
*23:44.560- 23:47.800* :  a push in America at the moment on the hard right
*23:47.800- 23:51.540* :  of particularly in Congress to discredit Ukraine and the war
*23:51.720- 23:54.220* :  and to undermine American support for that,
*23:54.220- 23:55.900* :  which is critical at present time,
*23:55.900- 23:58.100* :  particularly terms of armed supplies.
*23:58.660- 24:03.000* :  Do you think that there is some merit in Americans
*24:03.000- 24:08.880* :  getting to see Vladimir Putin defending the war,
*24:08.880- 24:11.840* :  even if he is allowed to say things about it
*24:11.840- 24:13.820* :  that are not true or attendentious?
*24:14.800- 24:15.860* :  I personally don't.
*24:15.860- 24:18.220* :  And I think you've got to bear in mind that Putin
*24:18.220- 24:19.680* :  is an indicted war criminal.
*24:20.400- 24:23.560* :  And also that Russia has been resting and imprisoning,
*24:23.560- 24:25.880* :  in fact, Western journalists have laid
*24:25.880- 24:28.220* :  to have been trying to report on the war from Russia.
*24:29.000- 24:32.120* :  Al-Sukamasha, the ready for Europe and heaven,
*24:32.120- 24:34.600* :  Gershkovich, who are better known of Wall Street Journal,
*24:35.320- 24:37.420* :  are both in prison at the moment in Russia.
*24:38.160- 24:40.940* :  But I think even if you do argue that Putin should be given
*24:40.940- 24:44.620* :  a platform, Tucker Carlson's not the man to do it.
*24:44.620- 24:46.680* :  He's a propagandist, not a serious journalist.
*24:47.500- 24:48.940* :  And when he looked at serious people,
*24:48.940- 24:51.020* :  your own Steve Rosenberg, for example,
*24:51.740- 24:54.620* :  when he turned up at Putin's annual media event
*24:54.620- 24:58.160* :  in December and tried to ask questions, he was refused.
*24:58.480- 25:00.360* :  And so I don't think this is a serious exercise.
*25:00.360- 25:02.820* :  It's an exercise of propaganda and nothing more.
*25:02.960- 25:06.800* :  Is there a risk as well that Putin will talk darkly
*25:06.800- 25:09.020* :  about the consequences for the West?
*25:09.380- 25:11.780* :  And I'm thinking of further war, possibly nuclear war,
*25:11.780- 25:14.720* :  which is something they have talked about in the past
*25:14.720- 25:18.460* :  if the West writ large doesn't stand down.
*25:19.500- 25:22.440* :  I think the Chinese have probably put that back in the box
*25:22.440- 25:26.400* :  and told Putin to stop talking about nuclear threats and so on.
*25:26.440- 25:28.700* :  But of course, what comes out from Putin
*25:28.760- 25:30.700* :  will be an attempt to divide the West
*25:30.760- 25:33.660* :  to spread divisions, particularly in the United States
*25:33.660- 25:36.200* :  and the run up to the elections this year,
*25:36.200- 25:38.540* :  which are pretty existential, I would argue,
*25:38.540- 25:40.720* :  for Putin and his campaign in Ukraine.
*25:41.520- 25:43.900* :  And the only way I think Putin will ever win the war
*25:43.940- 25:47.520* :  in Ukraine is by nullifying America's support for Ukraine,
*25:47.520- 25:50.860* :  which is his primary objective, I would say, at the moment.
*25:51.240- 25:53.640* :  Former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.
*25:54.220- 25:56.340* :  When it comes to football, conventional wisdom
*25:56.340- 25:58.760* :  has it that the manager is all important.
*25:58.760- 26:01.980* :  Where would Manchester United have been without Alex Ferguson
*26:01.980- 26:04.380* :  or Arsenal without Arson Venger?
*26:04.640- 26:06.980* :  In the modern era, it's all about Pep and Jürgen.
*26:07.500- 26:10.300* :  But how much impact does the manager really have?
*26:10.620- 26:13.360* :  Well, the hosts of the Africa Cup of Nations, Ivory Coast,
*26:13.440- 26:16.940* :  sacked their boss after a dismal start to the tournament.
*26:17.580- 26:19.860* :  And yet, they are now in the semi-final.
*26:20.220- 26:21.540* :  And ahead of that match, here are the thoughts
*26:21.540- 26:23.180* :  of football writer Simon Cooper.
*26:23.920- 26:26.200* :  There's a strange obsession in football with managers.
*26:26.660- 26:28.840* :  The manager gets too much credit when they win
*26:29.280- 26:31.140* :  and too much blame when their team lose.
*26:31.740- 26:34.380* :  In fact, that's why managers are sacked so often,
*26:34.740- 26:37.160* :  because they're seen as having almost magical powers
*26:37.500- 26:38.880* :  to achieve victory or defeat.
*26:39.420- 26:40.460* :  But I've never believed it.
*26:40.800- 26:43.020* :  I think managers just don't matter very much.
*26:43.480- 26:46.600* :  For a case study, look at the Ivory Coast host nation
*26:47.000- 26:48.700* :  of the current African Nations Cup.
*26:53.380- 26:56.060* :  The Ivory and national team, nicknamed the Elephants,
*26:56.480- 26:58.420* :  started the tournament disastrously.
*26:58.800- 27:01.260* :  When they lost four nils, a little equatorial guinea,
*27:01.300- 27:03.800* :  they risk being knocked out of their own tournament.
*27:04.480- 27:05.760* :  Somehow, the elephants survived.
*27:06.440- 27:08.660* :  But their French manager, Jean-Louis Garcia,
*27:08.660- 27:09.340* :  did not.
*27:09.860- 27:10.640* :  He was sacked.
*27:10.920- 27:13.980* :  Garcia's replacement, assistant coach Emerson Faye,
*27:13.980- 27:16.820* :  had never managed a senior team of any kind.
*27:17.360- 27:19.700* :  Yet, under Faye, the elephants have revived
*27:19.700- 27:21.580* :  with drama and lots of luck.
*27:21.580- 27:24.760* :  They beat African champions Senegal, then Marley.
*27:25.120- 27:27.720* :  And tonight, they face the Democratic Republic of Congo
*27:28.240- 27:29.100* :  in the semi-final.
*27:32.220- 27:33.740* :  Does this mean Faye is a genius?
*27:34.460- 27:36.440* :  Did he inspire his men to victory?
*27:37.000- 27:37.600* :  I doubt it.
*27:38.140- 27:40.840* :  By far, the best predictor of a club team strength
*27:40.840- 27:42.700* :  are the wages it pays its players.
*27:43.040- 27:44.880* :  Typically, the team with the highest salaries,
*27:44.880- 27:48.000* :  high as the best players, and finishes top of the league,
*27:48.340- 27:49.700* :  while the team with the lowest salaries
*27:49.700- 27:51.960* :  and worst players finishes bottom.
*27:52.560- 27:53.980* :  True, there are brief exceptions,
*27:54.260- 27:56.780* :  like not very rich Leicester City winning the Premier League
*27:56.780- 27:57.940* :  in 2016.
*27:57.980- 28:00.080* :  But measured over a 10-year period,
*28:00.480- 28:04.380* :  players' salaries explain about 90% of team performance.
*28:05.160- 28:07.660* :  The message, good players win football matches.
*28:08.260- 28:09.860* :  Managers matter much less.
*28:10.560- 28:13.800* :  In fact, it's estimated that only about 10% of them
*28:13.900- 28:15.840* :  consistently improved their teams.
*28:16.300- 28:19.840* :  Managers like Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp, and Alex Ferguson.
*28:20.280- 28:22.520* :  But most managers add so little value.
*28:23.680- 28:25.880* :  If I've recosed win the African Nations Cup,
*28:26.420- 28:27.960* :  their manager, Emma Saffair,
*28:28.500- 28:29.920* :  will be celebrated as the hero.
*28:30.640- 28:31.200* :  He shouldn't be.
*28:32.000- 28:35.520* :  In football, almost always, players win matches.
*28:36.900- 28:38.420* :  Football writer Simon Cooper.
*28:38.960- 28:42.280* :  And finally, fermented rice cake, mushroom puree,
*28:42.280- 28:43.780* :  and a side of plantain.
*28:43.780- 28:45.180* :  Just some of the dishes that have helped
*28:45.180- 28:48.520* :  at a Joke Bakare become the first black woman in the UK
*28:48.520- 28:50.260* :  to be awarded a Michelin star.
*28:50.860- 28:53.480* :  She is the founder and head chef at Chisharou,
*28:53.540- 28:56.200* :  which specialises in West African cooking.
*28:56.840- 28:58.100* :  She spoke to Sarah Montague.
*28:58.760- 29:01.060* :  I'm still in a days I have to say.
*29:01.640- 29:04.200* :  I think people could connect to the fact
*29:04.200- 29:06.360* :  that we're showing our heritage
*29:06.360- 29:08.480* :  and people could see themselves on the table.
*29:08.960- 29:12.120* :  Most people that come here haven't had the food before,
*29:12.560- 29:16.020* :  but people could see bits that remind them of themselves.
*29:16.820- 29:20.840* :  So our ex-sourced, which is, it's called shito,
*29:21.420- 29:24.080* :  but had somebody come here and they go,
*29:24.120- 29:26.000* :  oh, it's like ex-sourced.
*29:27.040- 29:28.480* :  I know ex-sourced.
*29:29.000- 29:30.400* :  So it's things like that.
*29:31.000- 29:33.320* :  Because I think before West African food
*29:33.320- 29:37.960* :  has been seen as this fairly scary, inaccessible thing.
*29:38.740- 29:41.660* :  But when people come, they see that part of it,
*29:41.860- 29:43.660* :  tell their friends, and for us mostly,
*29:43.660- 29:44.960* :  it has been worth of mouth.
*29:45.240- 29:46.720* :  So do you think it's been overlooked?
*29:46.860- 29:48.620* :  I mean, it seems astonishing to me that you're only
*29:48.620- 29:50.120* :  the second black woman globally,
*29:50.120- 29:53.560* :  but also that West African food hasn't had a sort of
*29:53.860- 29:55.820* :  featured in the list of Michelin stars.
*29:56.140- 29:57.440* :  Well, with this now, thank God,
*29:57.440- 30:00.200* :  they'll start looking into the continent itself.
*30:00.200- 30:04.560* :  They're loads of young books, doing fantastic things.
*30:05.280- 30:07.180* :  I think we're more people going on holidays,
*30:07.180- 30:10.180* :  eating food, then coming back and going,
*30:10.220- 30:14.780* :  oh, this is not something that I've not had before.
*30:15.040- 30:17.220* :  I was thinking, you think about there are restaurants,
*30:17.220- 30:19.820* :  whether it's, I don't know, the sort of brands
*30:20.000- 30:24.560* :  that have made Japanese food very popular and widely known,
*30:25.260- 30:28.980* :  similarly for Lebanese food around the Mediterranean.
*30:28.980- 30:33.180* :  Do we need some sort of brand across the country
*30:33.260- 30:37.960* :  that is going to introduce everyone to West African food?
*30:38.380- 30:40.640* :  I think we are doing that now, aren't we?
*30:41.580- 30:44.460* :  But as much as we want people to have it,
*30:44.720- 30:47.520* :  for me, it is also about the history.
*30:47.520- 30:52.740* :  So that it's not diluted so much that it's low loses itself.
*30:53.200- 30:55.440* :  I mean, obviously it's a huge accolade,
*30:55.440- 30:57.120* :  it's a complement.
*30:57.640- 31:01.140* :  Is it also change or does it feel a little bit like a weight?
*31:01.140- 31:04.700* :  Because now, people are going to come with certain expectations.
*31:05.520- 31:08.740* :  Oh, yes, there is that.
*31:10.200- 31:12.920* :  There is this thing where I say, yes, it's a change.
*31:13.160- 31:16.040* :  I spoke to a chef friend of mine yesterday
*31:16.560- 31:17.760* :  and he was close to tears.
*31:17.760- 31:21.920* :  He said, oh my God, this has restored my faith in Michelin
*31:22.240- 31:24.720* :  because it means it's all about the food now.
*31:25.380- 31:26.520* :  Adage OK, Bakari.
*31:29.140- 31:30.680* :  And that is all from us for now,
*31:30.680- 31:33.000* :  but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*31:33.000- 31:36.680* :  This edition was mixed by Pat Sissons and produced by Rebecca Wood.
