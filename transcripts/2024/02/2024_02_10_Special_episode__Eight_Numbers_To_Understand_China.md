*01:30.340- 01:31.720* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:39.720- 01:45.740* :  Happy Lunar New Year, the year of the dragon. I'm Celia Hatton, Asia Pacific Editor for the BBC.
*01:45.980- 01:51.980* :  When I first moved to Beijing years ago, something one of my Chinese colleagues Lily said
*01:51.980- 01:57.880* :  has always stuck with me. In China, she explained, it always comes back to the numbers.
*01:58.800- 02:05.000* :  Numbers and data can shed light on the big trends, things that are happening inside China right now.
*02:05.540- 02:12.460* :  So with that in mind, welcome to eight numbers to understand China. We've chosen eight special
*02:12.460- 02:18.420* :  numbers and gathered a host of fascinating people to let us in on the wider meaning behind each
*02:18.420- 02:24.380* :  of them. Why fewer people are getting married, why millions of apartments are sitting empty,
*02:24.560- 02:29.000* :  and even why there's only one mythical creature on the Chinese zodiac.
*02:30.360- 02:37.840* :  Why eight? It's a lucky number in China, and it surfaces a lot this time of year. So let's get going.
*02:38.680- 02:45.760* :  Our first number, the number 35, China's life expectancy back in 1949 when the country was founded.
*02:46.320- 02:52.980* :  That's right, Chinese people lived to an average age of 35 when the people's republic came into being.
*02:53.640- 03:00.320* :  Now, the average person in China can expect to live to just over 78. That's higher than the US.
*03:01.080- 03:07.280* :  The rise in China's life expectancy reveals just how quickly life there has transformed
*03:07.280- 03:14.760* :  within a relatively short span of time. And as Chinese broadcaster Yang Yi explains, older generations
*03:14.840- 03:21.340* :  plan their lives far differently now. This figure is matters for Chinese people because I think
*03:21.340- 03:27.800* :  the Chinese people is really care about live longer or longevity. So I think it is like kind of
*03:27.800- 03:34.480* :  evidence or proof to show you know how like Chinese people's life changing a lot in the past six
*03:34.480- 03:43.320* :  decades. Back in 1949, when this new nations founded, the Chinese people just went through the
*03:43.320- 03:50.400* :  two major war, the second war and the civil war. So that is why the average age is too short.
*03:51.360- 03:57.540* :  But when the time goes to the 1980s, China is starting their economic reform.
*03:58.060- 04:04.740* :  And other people now like retirement, they were playing for how they will spend the next two or
*04:04.740- 04:11.980* :  even three decades to enjoy their retirement. And what about your family? Do you see that reflected
*04:12.020- 04:17.100* :  in your family in terms of what your grandparents might have experienced? Yes, absolutely. I
*04:17.100- 04:24.460* :  still remember the year of 1994 is my grandparents' retire. At that year, I just age of five. I
*04:24.460- 04:31.040* :  just remember my grandparents is enjoyed their very heavy life. They could watch TV in the morning,
*04:31.040- 04:38.340* :  they could do the morning exercises. So I still remember when I was very young, I just love my
*04:38.340- 04:45.540* :  grandparents life. But my mom usually tells me that when you old, you will get this kind of joy for
*04:45.540- 04:50.260* :  like your grandpa grandma. But what's interesting is that your grandparents will probably,
*04:51.000- 04:56.100* :  their grandparents didn't have that same experience, right? They were probably some of the first to
*04:56.100- 05:02.820* :  really be able to retire and be able to look forward to a nice long retirement. Yes, like for
*05:02.820- 05:10.460* :  my grandparents, I think they are the first generation. Their whole, the career experience are all
*05:10.460- 05:18.540* :  in this new country. So it's very different. Many of their peers, they spend the whole
*05:18.540- 05:23.340* :  life working for a state-owned company. You know, the state-owned company will cover
*05:23.340- 05:29.280* :  everything about your life, especially like playing your retirement. So I think for them,
*05:29.280- 05:35.780* :  yeah, they're truly the first different generation in the whole Chinese history. Broadcaster Yang
*05:35.780- 05:37.960* :  Yi. Onto our next number.
*05:46.680- 05:51.380* :  The next number is nine. The number of years China's marriage rate has been declining.
*05:52.240- 05:57.940* :  I am later hung fincher. I'm the author of a book called Leftover Women,
*05:57.940- 06:05.820* :  the resurgence of gender inequality in China. So later nine years of decline in the marriage rate.
*06:05.860- 06:14.000* :  Can you talk to us about that figure and what it tells us? Well, China's marriage rate has fallen
*06:14.000- 06:22.240* :  for nine straight years, which is a very long time. That decline is coming to a large extent
*06:22.240- 06:27.920* :  from young women, especially those who've gone to college who just don't want to get married
*06:27.920- 06:33.360* :  anymore. What led to this change in attitude towards marriage? What fueled it?
*06:34.100- 06:41.040* :  Partly it's coming from the state, from government regulations. The government has actually made
*06:41.040- 06:49.180* :  it a lot more difficult to get a divorce. Another thing that was really important is that in 2011,
*06:49.420- 06:57.520* :  there was a big legal change regarding marital property. The effect of the change was that
*06:57.520- 07:06.720* :  marital property belongs to the person who purchased the property. And because property has
*07:06.720- 07:15.120* :  tended to be owned solely by men in China, all these married women often don't have their names
*07:15.120- 07:22.720* :  on the property deeds of marital property. So if they divorce, these women don't get any share
*07:22.720- 07:28.880* :  of the marital property. So that's a huge blow to women's economic rights in marriage.
*07:30.620- 07:34.900* :  Is the government trying to reverse this? Is it trying to encourage people to get married?
*07:36.040- 07:41.660* :  Absolutely. And the thing is the government has been trying to push especially educated young women
*07:41.660- 07:50.320* :  into marriage for a long time, especially since 2007, when the government launched this propaganda
*07:50.320- 07:57.760* :  campaign about so-called leftover women, a deliberate attempt to shame single-educated women
*07:58.180- 08:03.640* :  and to make them feel like they really have to get married or no man is going to want to marry them.
*08:04.320- 08:09.020* :  Do you think anything might change this trajectory? We've seen nine years of a decline in marriage
*08:09.020- 08:16.520* :  rates. Nine consecutive years of decline is a very long time. But I just don't see
*08:17.520- 08:24.400* :  marriage and birth rates just rebounding really significantly. Actually, just a few months ago,
*08:24.400- 08:32.980* :  Xi Jinping, who's the ruler of China, actually said that China has to become more of a
*08:33.420- 08:41.080* :  marriage and child-wearing culture and that the government wants to more proactively encourage
*08:41.260- 08:49.020* :  marriage and childbirth. Later, Home Fincher, author of Left Over Women. Time to hear some of our messages.
*08:57.700- 09:03.180* :  Hi, Celia. It's Tessa Wong from the Asia Online Team in Singapore. Now, the number I'd like to
*09:03.180- 09:09.280* :  choose is 6.39. That's China's birth rate last year. It was a second year running that the
*09:09.280- 09:14.540* :  population shrank. But they're hoping that things will turn around this year. That's because it's
*09:14.540- 09:20.300* :  the year of the dragon. It's considered the luckiest year to be born in. So, many couples have been
*09:20.300- 09:25.980* :  planning to have dragon babies and they're sharing tips online on how to conceive. Now, it may not
*09:25.980- 09:32.100* :  make a huge difference. In the past, dragon year birth rate bumps were minuscule. But for China these
*09:32.100- 09:39.840* :  days, every baby counts. Hi, global news podcast. I'm Rupert Wingfield Hayes, Asia correspondent based
*09:39.960- 09:45.160* :  in Taipei. And the number I've chosen is 12. Because that's the current number of countries that
*09:45.160- 09:51.000* :  officially recognize Taiwan. If you include the Vatican, which isn't really a country, but never mind.
*09:51.000- 09:56.940* :  Why is it significant? Well, because until recently, the number was 13 and it could soon be 11.
*09:56.940- 10:03.020* :  The tiny state of Nauru switched to Beijing last month and the equally tiny Pacific state of
*10:03.020- 10:09.140* :  Tuvalu could be next. Taiwan still has some close political allies, but most of the micro states that
*10:09.140- 10:14.960* :  stick with Taiwan arguably do so for the rather crude reason that Taipei gives them lots of money.
*10:15.500- 10:21.420* :  China can now match or often overmatch Taiwan's financial inducements. It's been reported that
*10:21.420- 10:26.080* :  Beijing promised Nauru a hundred million US dollars to get it to switch recognition.
*10:26.820- 10:32.100* :  China's displeasure at Taiwan again electing a president from the pro-independence democratic
*10:32.100- 10:37.880* :  progressive party will likely lead to Beijing luring away more of Taiwan's allies in the coming
*10:37.880- 10:45.520* :  months. Always good to hear from our correspondents. On to our next number. 7.2 million, the number of
*10:45.520- 10:53.640* :  vacant, unsold apartments in mainland China. 7.2 million, a bit of a sticky number for Chinese
*10:53.640- 11:00.080* :  officials because for every empty apartment, there's often an investor who's lost money or an
*11:00.080- 11:05.520* :  embarrassed Chinese official who gave the okay to a building project, thinking the economy would
*11:05.520- 11:12.340* :  take off in a place that didn't actually attract many people. The number of empty, unfinished or
*11:12.340- 11:18.440* :  unsold dwellings is a sensitive number in China, so it's rare to hear Chinese officials say anything
*11:24.040- 11:28.160* :  like this. How many vacant homes are there now? Each expert gives a very different number,
*11:28.540- 11:33.280* :  with the most extreme believing the current number of vacant homes are enough for three billion
*11:33.280- 11:40.020* :  people. That's He Kang, former deputy head of the statistics bureau. Other more conservative
*11:40.020- 11:47.380* :  estimates put the number of empty but finished apartments or flats at 7.2 million. Not still a
*11:47.380- 11:54.760* :  huge figure. For more, we're turning back to Yang Yi. Why so many unsold empty places?
*11:55.400- 12:02.900* :  Usually in, we so call the second or third tiers of Chinese cities, it is not that the famous
*12:02.900- 12:08.580* :  cities as you know like Beijing Shanghai. In the central Shanghai, there's no room with
*12:08.580- 12:15.780* :  empty. But maybe if you see the city called Nanchang, it is located in the middle of the China,
*12:16.400- 12:24.120* :  and it has a highly like empty housing rate. So in the past several years, the government
*12:24.120- 12:30.740* :  believed they could sell more lands and attract the property enterprises to build new house here.
*12:31.540- 12:39.560* :  But because for the government, it is a big income about to sell the land. But they do not care
*12:39.560- 12:47.620* :  about the future because maybe for these cities, no enough like younger people work there or leave
*12:47.620- 12:53.020* :  there. They do not need so many houses or flats. So that is why they're empty now.
*12:53.620- 13:01.460* :  So people are buying, investing in these new apartments in kind of newer cities, new developments
*13:02.500- 13:07.960* :  in the belief that at some point they'll be in demand, that they'll be busy. Is that the idea?
*13:08.620- 13:14.440* :  Yes, I think in the past two decades in China, I think one thing I think that everyone
*13:15.420- 13:22.540* :  truly believes is the housing price where continuously rising. So I think it's a strong confidence
*13:22.540- 13:28.560* :  for everyone, not just the people who buy it, as well as the people who build it for the
*13:28.560- 13:34.080* :  property enterprises. They also believe the housing price will continuously rise. So many people see
*13:34.680- 13:37.420* :  the housing market is a good thing to invest.
*13:42.260- 13:47.960* :  Hello, this is Mickey Bristo. I'm the BBC's other Asia Pacific Editor. My number is,
*13:48.500- 13:54.080* :  well, I'm not sure what my number is. I want to know how many people were killed by the Chinese army
*13:54.080- 14:01.060* :  around Tiananmen Square in June 1989, following mass protests. Hundreds might have died perhaps
*14:01.060- 14:06.780* :  thousands, but there's no official publicly available figure. The Chinese government simply
*14:06.780- 14:12.180* :  hasn't released one. I've chosen this statistic to illustrate the secrecy that often surrounds
*14:12.180- 14:17.220* :  numbers in China. The Communist Party wants to control the narrative of just about everything
*14:17.220- 14:23.720* :  and some numbers, like this one, would tell a story it doesn't want to be heard. So the number
*14:23.720- 14:30.980* :  of dead around Tiananmen Square is a number that doesn't exist. Mickey brings us to an interesting
*14:30.980- 14:37.840* :  point. Let's pause for a moment here, just to acknowledge the idea that numbers can be manipulated.
*14:37.840- 14:43.260* :  That's true when it comes to China. Take the country's youth unemployment figure,
*14:43.260- 14:48.920* :  measuring the number of young people between the ages of 16 and 24 who were out of work.
*14:49.600- 14:54.060* :  That jobless number soared last year, just as the Chinese economy was tanking,
*14:54.480- 15:00.580* :  reaching a high of 21.3% last June. That's more than one in five young people.
*15:01.260- 15:04.940* :  And then the government abruptly stopped publishing the data.
*15:08.360- 15:12.220* :  The youth unemployment number wasn't being calculated correctly,
*15:12.220- 15:17.820* :  explained China's state's statistics bureau. The data had included students who were looking
*15:17.820- 15:23.120* :  for jobs before they graduated and some officials thought that wasn't accurate. But many in the
*15:23.120- 15:28.100* :  public thought the decision to pull the data was fishy, and they complained online.
*15:29.200- 15:35.940* :  Months of silence followed, and then a new youth unemployment number was released in January.
*15:35.940- 15:43.460* :  A new calculation method brought the number down to 14.9%. It's a much lower number than before
*15:43.460- 15:50.440* :  because it excludes those still in school. Case in point, numbers can sometimes be malleable,
*15:50.440- 15:56.060* :  but they're still worth paying attention to, even just ask why, when the Chinese economy
*15:56.060- 16:01.240* :  isn't doing very well, the government decided to change how a number is calculated.
*16:02.060- 16:06.460* :  Let's move on to our next example. Next in eight numbers to understand China,
*16:06.460- 16:11.220* :  the number three. The number of seconds China's most popular live stream seller
*16:11.260- 16:15.380* :  needed to display a product before that method of selling was banned.
*16:16.060- 16:19.000* :  Hi, I'm Carrie Allen, and I'm a China media analyst at the BBC.
*16:19.740- 16:24.660* :  Okay, so Carrie, the next number we're going to discuss is three, three seconds,
*16:24.700- 16:31.500* :  and it relates to an online seller named Zheng Shang Shang. Can you tell us who she is,
*16:31.720- 16:38.000* :  and how she was selling products online? So Zheng Shang Shang, she gained the nickname,
*16:38.000- 16:41.920* :  the Queen of Doyin, and Doyin being China's domestic version of TikTok.
*16:51.220- 16:56.480* :  If you watch one of her live streams, a box just comes into view from one side of the screen,
*16:56.520- 17:01.580* :  and she'll literally open the lid, hold an item up, say the price of it, for example a t-shirt,
*17:01.580- 17:06.080* :  you see the t-shirt, and then she literally just throws it off screen, and another box appears
*17:06.080- 17:11.300* :  from the other side, and she grabs it, opens the box, shows maybe a towel or some socks,
*17:11.580- 17:17.660* :  throws the box off screen. It reminds me of game shows in the 1980s where it's bonkers.
*17:17.880- 17:22.040* :  It is, yes. I mean, when I originally watched one of her videos, I was thinking that
*17:22.340- 17:27.040* :  like a lot of online sellers, she'll be selling luxury items, which are very popular in China,
*17:27.600- 17:33.360* :  but China does have a huge live streaming industry, and actually during the first half of
*17:33.360- 17:38.840* :  2023, there were more than 110 million e-commerce live streams. So a lot of people are thinking,
*17:38.840- 17:44.680* :  how do I become a bit different? So they rely on their appearances, or in her case,
*17:44.860- 17:50.440* :  they do something incredibly wacky like this, and people watching these live streams,
*17:50.540- 17:55.080* :  they were just taken aback that you could sell an item so quickly, three seconds.
*17:55.860- 17:59.240* :  But China's banned this method of selling now, right?
*17:59.700- 18:06.600* :  Yes, I get the sense that the government was very nervous about this tactic of selling in
*18:06.600- 18:12.240* :  such a way, because one of the things, these items being very cheap, they can be faulty items,
*18:12.240- 18:17.580* :  they can be problems with them. So yeah, these new regulations, they came into effect in late October,
*18:18.260- 18:22.880* :  but her live streams now are very, very closely watched, and what she does instead is she takes a
*18:22.980- 18:28.980* :  bit more time selling items. So Celia, there's another number I want to flag up to you as well,
*18:28.980- 18:34.540* :  and that is 404. When I was living in China, I'd see it all the time if I accidentally typed
*18:34.540- 18:40.380* :  in Facebook, Google, or Twitter, platforms that are censored in the country. It's the error message
*18:40.380- 18:46.980* :  that displays error 404, and it's become a number that's synonymous with secrecy and things the
*18:46.980- 18:52.060* :  government doesn't want people to see. And do people try to get round this 404 number?
*18:53.020- 18:58.880* :  They can do yes with a VPN. If they want to access platforms that the great firewall of China has
*18:59.380- 19:04.580* :  censored, so a piece of software can allow them to circumvent censored websites.
*19:05.500- 19:11.320* :  It's become a buzzword online where people basically say that they can't talk. So if they want
*19:11.320- 19:16.340* :  to talk about a sensitive topic and they know that if doing so, their message gets censored,
*19:16.640- 19:21.540* :  they will literally say 404. It's a way of people almost saying, I can't speak openly.
*19:22.760- 19:26.340* :  The BBC's Carrie Allen. Let's check our messages again.
*19:28.340- 19:33.840* :  Good day, Global News. Pod, I'm Stephen McDonald in the Beijing Bureau, and my number is six.
*19:34.520- 19:41.940* :  For the region's most famous here for spicy food. Hunan Hubei Sichuan Chongqing Yunnan and Guijiao.
*19:42.640- 19:49.680* :  Someone also add dishes from Jiangxi and Guangxi as an extra. Whatever spicy Chinese food can be
*19:49.680- 19:55.800* :  a revelation if you've only ever tried the sweeter Chinese dishes from the south. And nothing
*19:55.800- 20:02.300* :  goes better with tongue numbing Sichuan peppers than a glass of Aussie Red. Hmm, I'm hungry now.
*20:04.840- 20:09.100* :  Hi, Global News. Pod, this is Martin Yip with BBC News Chinese in Hong Kong,
*20:09.100- 20:16.160* :  and my pick is 23. So Britain handed Hong Kong back to China nearly 27 years ago.
*20:16.760- 20:22.480* :  Under the terms of that deal caught the basic law, article 23 demands Hong Kong to write
*20:22.480- 20:28.720* :  its own security law to protect China from things like Aspire Narch. Hong Kong tried to put
*20:28.720- 20:35.580* :  the security law in 2003, but the straight terms of that deal led to beg street protests.
*20:36.260- 20:41.720* :  Then after the massive 2019 pro-democracy demonstrations, China's communist governments
*20:41.720- 20:48.460* :  imposed its own version of the security law onto Hong Kong. Many activists and opposition politicians
*20:48.460- 20:54.760* :  went to prison or are living in exile, and civil life has pretty much disappeared.
*20:55.620- 21:01.360* :  Now, Hong Kong's leader Zhong Li wants to answer to Beijing's demands to put in Hong Kong's own
*21:01.360- 21:08.380* :  version of the security law and to criminalize even more things. And so, article 23 legislation
*21:08.380- 21:10.440* :  is back on the agenda.
*21:19.100- 21:23.740* :  Thanks to Stephen McDonald and Martin Yip and onto our chosen numbers.
*21:24.300- 21:30.140* :  The number two, China produced and used as much cement in two years as the US did in the last
*21:30.140- 21:36.540* :  century. That's a fact that was often thrown around on the internet. It caught the attention of
*21:36.540- 21:43.000* :  Hannah Richie, who worked for the online scientific publication Our World in Data. And so,
*21:43.000- 21:47.840* :  she did some digging of her own. First, I think I was a bit skeptical about that statistic,
*21:47.840- 21:53.620* :  because it seems very farfetched. But yes, I checked the numbers. I went to the US Geological Survey,
*21:53.620- 21:58.480* :  who tracked global cement production. And it turns out that it's true. Every two years,
*21:58.480- 22:02.980* :  China does produce more cement than the US did over the entire 20th century.
*22:03.420- 22:07.300* :  Now, I think that's important for a few reasons. I think it tells us a few stories about China.
*22:07.300- 22:14.180* :  I think just the first and the glaring one is how quickly China is industrialising. China has
*22:14.580- 22:19.480* :  been growing very quickly, economically. And what we tend to see when countries grow very fast,
*22:19.480- 22:24.760* :  economically, is they start to urbanise very quickly, right? People tend to move from rural areas
*22:24.760- 22:30.040* :  into cities. And that just needs a lot of infrastructure. It needs roads, it needs bridges,
*22:30.040- 22:34.900* :  it needs buildings. And that has led to just very, there's a big boom in cement production.
*22:35.460- 22:41.420* :  But some might say, isn't there a difference between China producing cement and China using cement?
*22:41.420- 22:44.660* :  Could it have exported some of that cement that it produced?
*22:45.380- 22:49.800* :  Yeah, I also had that question. I thought maybe China is just exporting it to the rest of the world
*22:49.800- 22:53.420* :  and consuming very little of it. But actually, when you break down the numbers,
*22:53.420- 22:59.060* :  the amount that China exports is actually very, very small. So most of the cement that China is
*22:59.060- 23:03.740* :  producing is actually consuming and the infrastructure that's building domestically.
*23:04.420- 23:09.900* :  So how do we talk a lot about China's use of resources? But there's a flip side to all of this,
*23:10.020- 23:13.100* :  isn't there when it comes to China's environmental record?
*23:13.980- 23:18.540* :  Yeah, so we often talk about China's consumption of resources. We were talking about cement there,
*23:18.540- 23:24.300* :  but there's also coal consumption, which has grown very rapidly in China. But there's a flip side
*23:24.300- 23:30.020* :  to this where China is also moving extremely quickly on clean energy, just to give a few stats
*23:30.020- 23:36.160* :  that might put this in perspective. So last year, China added enough solar and wind to power
*23:36.160- 23:42.400* :  the UK or France. And that's just one year of installations would be enough to cover whole European
*23:42.400- 23:49.120* :  countries. Another sat that might put that into context, so that in that year, China added more solar
*23:49.120- 23:55.860* :  than the US has built in its entire history. So China is now moving extremely quickly on this clean
*23:55.860- 24:01.120* :  energy, which is now starting to slightly tip its environmental record in the other way.
*24:01.560- 24:05.420* :  And I think we will actually just start to see really positive transitions here.
*24:05.960- 24:12.260* :  Dr. Hannah Richie from our world in data with a bit of good news coming from the numbers in China.
*24:13.040- 24:19.060* :  The next number is more than one million. As we've already mentioned, some numbers can be
*24:19.060- 24:24.600* :  difficult to pin down in China. That's true in the far western region of Xinjiang.
*24:25.280- 24:32.140* :  Facts surrounding China's persecuted Muslim-weager population inside Xinjiang are very difficult to
*24:32.140- 24:39.700* :  verify. They feature stories of torture and imprisonment on a vast scale. In 2018, the United
*24:39.700- 24:45.200* :  Nations said there were credible reports that more than a million weekers and other ethnic minorities
*24:45.200- 24:52.480* :  were being held in detention centers in Xinjiang. In 2022, a UN report included research
*24:52.480- 24:58.800* :  estimating that 10 to 20 percent of the adult ethnic population in Xinjiang had been detained
*24:58.800- 25:05.760* :  in such centers. Those are serious allegations that I put to Weager campaigner Rahima Mahmoud.
*25:06.620- 25:13.280* :  Even though people repeated that this large scale of detention being happening,
*25:13.340- 25:21.340* :  we couldn't really get attention from the international community until what you mentioned that UN
*25:21.920- 25:28.920* :  in 2018 said that we acknowledge that over one million. That's the time
*25:29.620- 25:37.660* :  like the world started to know about Uyghur people, started to notice about what is happening.
*25:38.400- 25:43.580* :  Can you tell us about your people? Tell us about the weekers and what they're facing right now.
*25:44.420- 25:50.080* :  Uyghurs, we are Muslim, we are Turkic, we speak Uyghur language, which is very similar to
*25:50.440- 25:58.000* :  Uzbek languages and because also the so-called Xinjiang, the new frontier is colonized by China
*25:58.460- 26:05.800* :  and there have been a lot of resistance, the policies that was implemented very discriminative
*26:05.800- 26:13.020* :  until last seven years than we are facing genocide. So really in the past, what starting around
*26:13.140- 26:19.700* :  estimated around 2016 or so, that's when it's believed that China's began opening up a network
*26:19.700- 26:24.560* :  of detention centers, detention camps, can you tell me? Well, the detention centers were always
*26:24.560- 26:32.340* :  there, but the concentration camps that they built very, very large scale of concentration camps,
*26:32.840- 26:40.560* :  some can hold up to 30,000 people. But Beijing would say these places that you have called
*26:40.560- 26:46.600* :  concentration camps, they say we're not doing anything wrong. These are retraining centers,
*26:46.600- 26:53.500* :  they call them. People can come and go as they like. What would you say to them? They say it's
*26:53.500- 27:00.720* :  re-education centers and all that, but I said the like images showed that it's with bobbed wire
*27:00.720- 27:08.800* :  layers and layers of this security and also we had so many testimonies from the survivors
*27:09.340- 27:15.700* :  about torture, about food deprivation, about how crowded the facilities are, how they were forced
*27:15.700- 27:22.740* :  to denounce religion, denounce their language, and forced sterilization, forced abortion,
*27:23.460- 27:33.480* :  forced confessions. We have heard so many accounts of these people who were detained inside
*27:33.480- 27:40.020* :  and later were released because they had foreign connections. You know, we've been talking
*27:40.620- 27:46.340* :  about these big numbers and what's been happening on a vast scale, but we can't forget this is
*27:46.340- 27:51.360* :  a really personal story for you as well. You have a personal number as well. What would that be?
*27:52.600- 28:01.380* :  So I have nine siblings when I left in 2000. After six years, didn't hear anything about what
*28:01.380- 28:09.440* :  happened to them. And last year in April, I learned my eldest sister died. And my brother, who I spoke
*28:09.440- 28:19.400* :  to back in 2017, was inside the camp in three different camps, was released because of severe
*28:19.400- 28:27.100* :  health problems. I know now that I have eight siblings, and the person who passed me this
*28:27.420- 28:35.060* :  information said, make sure don't contact any of them for their safety. I simply don't have any
*28:35.060- 28:44.200* :  information. And it's sad, it's difficult. You know, during COVID, when people couldn't visit their
*28:44.200- 28:51.920* :  family, at least they could speak to them over the phone, right? And just imagine all that we
*28:51.920- 29:00.360* :  were living in exile. And only when someone died in the family, someone managed to pass on that
*29:00.360- 29:07.840* :  information. Rahima Mahmoud. Next in eight numbers to understand China, the number seven,
*29:07.840- 29:14.080* :  the number of men who really rule China. We've gotten through lots of numbers so far,
*29:14.080- 29:20.020* :  touching on everything from demographics to real estate. But we haven't yet talked much about
*29:20.020- 29:26.460* :  who's really in charge in China. It's a complicated question. Between the Communist Party and the
*29:26.460- 29:32.080* :  Chinese government, which runs alongside it, there's a whole pyramid of officials in China,
*29:32.080- 29:38.180* :  from local towns, through to provinces that are bigger than European countries, right up to the
*29:38.180- 29:45.720* :  central government in Beijing. But right at the top of that pyramid sits one committee with seven
*29:45.720- 29:53.940* :  men, including China's top leader, Xi Jinping. So who are the mysterious seven? A question I put to
*29:53.940- 30:00.040* :  Dr. Yudier. I'm Dr. Yudier. I'm senior research fellow on China at Chatham House,
*30:00.040- 30:06.580* :  I think tanklacing London. So, Yudier, we're focusing now on the number seven. Yes. The number
*30:06.580- 30:13.380* :  of men who sit on the Politburo Standing Committee, which is a bit of a dull sounding term, but actually
*30:13.380- 30:19.620* :  that group of seven is very important in China, isn't it? Can you explain why? Absolutely. I mean,
*30:19.620- 30:26.000* :  the magnificent seven sitting on the apex of the Chinese politics. All the seven universally
*30:26.000- 30:33.100* :  gentlemen are close political allies and comfort zones are presently, and the Standing Committee
*30:33.100- 30:38.580* :  of the Polar Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, which decide almost every single policy
*30:38.940- 30:45.760* :  of the state as well as the party. And that is make these seven men, which run the world's
*30:45.760- 30:50.900* :  second largest economy, become very important. I've seen from images that they dress in a similar
*30:50.900- 30:56.640* :  way in the photos that have been released, a video of been released of them, no women sitting
*30:56.640- 31:00.560* :  at the table. Yes. I don't think there's ever been a woman. There has never been the case of
*31:00.560- 31:06.340* :  women in the Standing Committee. I think there's also partially to do with the history how the party
*31:06.340- 31:11.080* :  has involved. This seems to be unspoken rule that if they're going to recruit women,
*31:12.060- 31:19.780* :  and that need to have a thorough evaluation. Wow. What unites the seven, or the six and president
*31:19.780- 31:25.520* :  she? How did they get to hold a seat at that table? First thing is the political loyalty,
*31:25.960- 31:31.060* :  and of course they're loyal to presidency and has to be loyal to the party. And secondly,
*31:31.260- 31:38.360* :  they also represent a different geographic areas of the country as well. And I think thirdly,
*31:38.360- 31:44.440* :  an each of them specializing on one policy area. So that's why we have this number seven.
*31:45.620- 31:52.400* :  UDM. Now, some might think that Xi Jinping is so powerful that we really should have saved
*31:52.400- 31:59.040* :  a number on this podcast just for him, the number one. But no, the number one, our last number
*31:59.040- 32:05.860* :  will be devoted to another powerful creature, the dragon. Let's not forget that this lunar new year
*32:05.860- 32:11.540* :  is the year of the dragon, and the dragon is the only mythical creature on the Chinese zodiac.
*32:11.540- 32:20.000* :  To explain why, here's Chinese Feng Shui master, Angela Ang. There are 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac,
*32:20.600- 32:27.480* :  and most of them are farm animals, and the dragon is the only mythical creature. And I think it was
*32:27.480- 32:33.520* :  purposely made this way. So first of all, being a mythical creature, that means that it will have
*32:33.520- 32:41.300* :  superpowers that the other animals will not have. And in China, Huang Di, the first emperor,
*32:41.960- 32:49.420* :  is known for being a dragon or like reborn from a dragon. If somebody's born in the year of the
*32:49.420- 32:58.180* :  dragon, a lot of them can appear mysterious, imaginative, and ambiguous. So dragons have a certain
*32:58.180- 33:05.700* :  charm about them. If you are born in the year of the dragon, it does not mean you're going to have
*33:05.700- 33:13.940* :  an extra good year. It actually means you are against the year your cosmos is actually out of
*33:13.940- 33:22.400* :  sync. That means this year, be careful of self sabotage. That's right. Angela, so just interject.
*33:22.400- 33:29.680* :  So for example, my daughter is 12 this year. It's her year. She's year of the dragon. And I know
*33:29.680- 33:36.620* :  from my time in China that when it's your year, your zodiac year, you're expected to wear red
*33:36.620- 33:43.580* :  at all times during that year or something red. Can you take us through that tradition and why it's
*33:43.640- 33:47.380* :  it's recommended that you wear something red when it's your zodiac year?
*33:48.280- 33:53.960* :  So Chinese New Year, there are certain colors that we will wear and certain colors that we will
*33:53.960- 34:02.580* :  avoid. So you notice there's a lot of red because red considered a lucky and auspicious color.
*34:03.280- 34:09.480* :  During Chinese New Year, if you were older, you might give your child who's already 20 even,
*34:09.480- 34:15.020* :  yeah, before they get married, a red omelette with money in it as good luck. And those who receive
*34:15.020- 34:19.380* :  good luck, those who give get good luck. So there's something about the color red.
*34:20.200- 34:26.060* :  Now, traditions vary, but what's your favorite part of the Lunar New Year celebrations?
*34:27.260- 34:35.060* :  I think my favorite part is going to the parades and watching the celebrations. I absolutely
*34:35.060- 34:42.740* :  love watching the lion dances, the excitement, the smell of firecrackers, lots of them.
*34:44.860- 34:49.900* :  It's something you must experience. Well, thanks for joining us and happy new year to you,
*34:49.900- 34:56.520* :  Angela Sinianquayla. Sinianquayla. So I wish everybody a wonderful auspicious new year. Thank you.
