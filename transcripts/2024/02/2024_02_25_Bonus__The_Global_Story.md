*01:47.400- 01:50.780* :  I want to introduce to you the global story.
*01:50.980- 01:53.940* :  The host is with me, Katya Adlow, welcome.
*01:54.420- 01:55.440* :  Tell us about the global story.
*01:55.840- 01:57.120* :  Well, thank you for having me, first of all.
*01:57.120- 01:58.920* :  Thank you for having us in your feed.
*01:59.380- 02:02.760* :  The global story, so it's a brand new ish.
*02:03.500- 02:07.180* :  We're quite new still podcast with your sister, really.
*02:07.600- 02:11.020* :  And the idea is because you tell us what's going on in the news.
*02:11.580- 02:18.700* :  You tell us why it matters and we then take one new story every day and we look at it in detail.
*02:19.200- 02:21.700* :  And we also try and look at it from different perspectives.
*02:21.700- 02:23.320* :  I mean, it's the global story.
*02:23.640- 02:29.680* :  So we try to surprise you with different angles, for example, and just sort of dig a little deeper down the headlines.
*02:29.680- 02:32.480* :  It feels, Jack, I think you and I have talked about this before.
*02:33.240- 02:37.640* :  Everything feels like it's going so fast in the world and there are so many bad news stories.
*02:38.020- 02:39.740* :  It can feel a bit overwhelming at times.
*02:39.800- 02:45.620* :  So the idea of the global story is to take a breath and then with some brilliant BBC colleagues,
*02:45.620- 02:52.360* :  experts in their field, we sort of, you know, quietly have a look at what's actually going on and why it matters.
*02:52.860- 02:54.640* :  And what sorts of stories are we covering then?
*02:54.860- 02:55.460* :  All sorts.
*02:55.460- 02:59.620* :  It keeps me on my toes from Taylor Swift's impact on local economies
*02:59.700- 03:04.880* :  and whether she could actually influence the outcome of the US presidential election in November.
*03:04.880- 03:10.620* :  We've looked at electric vehicles and that Tesla's been given a run for its money
*03:11.020- 03:13.520* :  from Chinese car makers, for example.
*03:13.520- 03:16.820* :  Obviously, we've looked at Israel Gaza from all sorts of angles.
*03:16.820- 03:22.380* :  We try and get a lot of human stories in as well as geopolitical stories as well.
*03:22.380- 03:26.520* :  So and then we turn to our colleagues at the BBC, who as you know,
*03:26.520- 03:34.220* :  often devote a huge amount of time to researching specialist documentaries or specialist reports.
*03:34.720- 03:40.380* :  And so what we've got here for you today, it's all about the Bengal famine back in 1943.
*03:40.420- 03:45.940* :  Why now? Well, because the survivors of that famine are going, are leaving us.
*03:46.160- 03:48.360* :  So there's a rush against time to talk to them.
*03:48.620- 03:52.320* :  And it's never been talked about from their perspective the people who suffered most.
*03:52.960- 03:55.720* :  So let's hear this week's edition of the Global Story.
*03:58.900- 04:00.520* :  This is the Global Story.
*04:01.020- 04:05.500* :  One story in detail five days a week from the world's leading broadcaster.
*04:06.220- 04:12.460* :  Today, a story of searing human suffering in the dying days of the British Empire,
*04:13.120- 04:17.820* :  a famine thought to have killed at least three million people in Bengal
*04:18.320- 04:20.020* :  at the height of the Second World War.
*04:20.500- 04:24.060* :  Many died of cholera, smallpox and malaria that year.
*04:24.420- 04:26.680* :  A lot of people simply died of hunger too.
*04:27.200- 04:28.740* :  Have you heard of the Bengal famine?
*04:29.440- 04:31.260* :  If not, you're really not alone.
*04:32.000- 04:36.860* :  More than 80 years on, it's noteworthy that so little attention has been paid
*04:36.860- 04:40.020* :  to such a massive tragedy and the people who lived through it.
*04:40.020- 04:45.200* :  Not only in the West, but in the place where it happened in what's now India and Bangladesh.
*04:45.840- 04:47.800* :  The stories written by the people who it didn't affect.
*04:48.020- 04:50.620* :  They were not allowed to use the word famine.
*04:50.700- 04:52.120* :  They don't allow this to be broadcast.
*04:52.120- 04:57.360* :  Today, we hear from survivors whose voices have never been broadcast before,
*04:57.900- 05:01.440* :  and the people racing to record their stories before it's too late.
*05:02.100- 05:04.860* :  Along the way, we'll ask, who gets to write history?
*05:05.340- 05:08.740* :  And why is the Bengal famine such a divisive subject?
*05:11.500- 05:16.400* :  With me today is Kavita Puri, a BBC journalist who's made a brand new five-part
*05:16.400- 05:22.660* :  podcast for the BBC called Three Million, covering the Bengal famine of 1943.
*05:23.340- 05:28.520* :  Now, Kavita, a lot of your work at the BBC has looked at British South Asian identities
*05:28.520- 05:33.540* :  and perspectives and have they been shaped by colonial history.
*05:34.440- 05:41.460* :  Yes, so about 10 years ago, I was very aware that there was a lot of South Asian diasporic
*05:41.460- 05:45.740* :  history that hadn't been recorded before when I looked in the archives at the BBC and more
*05:45.740- 05:52.040* :  widely. It wasn't there. So I started recording the stories of people who came to Britain
*05:52.040- 05:57.340* :  in the post-war years. And then after that, I looked at people in Britain who'd gone through
*05:57.340- 06:02.740* :  the partition of India for the 70th anniversary, so colonial British and British South Asian.
*06:02.780- 06:06.720* :  And again, that was a story that had never been looked at from the perspective of the people
*06:06.720- 06:12.740* :  who lived through it, who live in our country. And so now, I'm looking at again,
*06:12.740- 06:17.600* :  another bit of colonial history, the Bengal famine, but trying to look at it through the perspective
*06:17.600- 06:27.140* :  of the lived experience. So let's have a look at the famine. You sort of stumbled across that.
*06:27.140- 06:31.220* :  Can you tell us a bit about that? Well, I had heard about millions of people dying
*06:31.220- 06:35.900* :  and the Bengal famine. I really didn't know that much more and I came to it really,
*06:35.900- 06:40.140* :  totally accidentally. I was recording people who'd lived through the partition of India,
*06:40.380- 06:44.160* :  and I was interviewing a woman who'd been part of the colonial British class, a woman called Pamela.
*06:45.440- 06:50.580* :  And she as a kind of a side, and it is quite disturbing, had talked about
*06:50.580- 06:58.060* :  vultures on the streets of Calcutta in 1943. There was no place you could go where you didn't see
*06:58.060- 07:04.920* :  dead bodies and vultures. It was revolting, actually. As the vultures used to come down and eat
*07:04.920- 07:12.180* :  these dead bodies, and there were dead people all over Calcutta. These scenes of horror were
*07:12.180- 07:17.720* :  unfolding on Calcutta's streets. And yet she said she carried on her life going to clubs.
*07:18.600- 07:23.620* :  It was also a time where there were hundreds of thousands of allied soldiers who were defending
*07:23.620- 07:29.280* :  Calcutta from the Japanese. And you know, I heard testimonies of allied soldiers who were having
*07:29.280- 07:35.060* :  a grand time. They were in restaurants eating delicious food, drinking cocktail bars,
*07:35.760- 07:41.440* :  with well-to-do Indians who never wanted for food. It was this kind of shocking tale of two
*07:41.440- 07:47.180* :  cities. And I wondered with the atheist anniversary if it was possible to piece together the story
*07:47.180- 07:54.120* :  of the famine from a wide range of Bengali voices. I'm really struck by what you say about
*07:54.340- 08:01.180* :  a tale of two cities there. You know, the lived reality of the British colonial officers and
*08:01.600- 08:07.040* :  wealthy Indians who were living in comfort. And then the stark contrast of those so poor,
*08:07.540- 08:12.440* :  they were struggling to survive or dying and being pecked out by those vultures.
*08:13.100- 08:17.820* :  Yeah, and it really was at the time. And these were not people who were beggars. These were people
*08:17.820- 08:23.460* :  who had come in from the rural countryside who were fishermen. They were agricultural workers.
*08:23.460- 08:30.880* :  They were laborers. They were artisans. There were so many mothers with children. And they died
*08:30.880- 08:37.700* :  in plain sight. You know, some people that I spoke to like Parthamitta, he was one. He was a
*08:37.700- 08:43.680* :  young boy and he would look out from the gates of his house and he would see what was going on.
*08:44.000- 08:50.920* :  I see from behind the gates that these emaciated women with children would come. The bodies,
*08:50.920- 08:57.180* :  you know, were so, so thin. They were desperate. I mean, they were just coming and streams.
*08:57.180- 09:03.180* :  Do you remember what they were asking for? Oh, yes. In Bengal, it's an active papandema.
*09:03.820- 09:10.060* :  Mother gave me a little bit of that watery bit of the rice. They were not even asking for rice.
*09:10.060- 09:16.540* :  They were asking for the drink. Because they're so desperate. They thought that people wouldn't
*09:16.540- 09:22.920* :  have the rice even to give them. Parthamitta says he never wanted for rice in his home. He lived
*09:22.920- 09:28.580* :  in a very grand house, but he saw this and it's really interesting that plea that he remembers
*09:28.580- 09:36.040* :  found out, the plea for the start water of rice. Pretty much every Bengali I spoke to remembers that.
*09:36.740- 09:41.620* :  It's a memory that's held by the people who observed the famine. They were not the people who
*09:41.620- 09:49.000* :  who suffered the most. What would you say was the cause of the famine, right? I mean, as many
*09:49.000- 09:57.220* :  historical instances, it's contested, complicated. Yeah, I mean, there isn't a cause. It's hugely
*09:57.220- 10:03.300* :  contested. The causes on which were the most important causes. But I think the way to think of
*10:03.300- 10:09.720* :  the famine is to think of the context, which is the Second World War. The Japanese were so close
*10:09.720- 10:15.980* :  to the Bengali border. There was a huge fear that they might invade British India. That's why
*10:15.980- 10:20.660* :  the Allied soldiers came to Calcutta in their hundreds of thousands. So they needed to be fed.
*10:21.480- 10:26.100* :  The colonial government was printing money in order to pay for all this with a sterling IOU in
*10:26.100- 10:35.420* :  London. So inflation was incredibly high. And rice, the staple food, was put under huge amounts
*10:35.420- 10:42.140* :  of strain. Not least, because after Burma fell, rice that was normally brought into Calcutta
*10:42.320- 10:48.540* :  from Burma was no longer there. And if you were an ordinary person in the rural areas who were
*10:48.680- 10:54.960* :  just about surviving anyhow, it was very, very difficult to afford rice at that time.
*10:56.200- 11:01.880* :  It's not an added strand to this, a cavita that I learnt about in your podcast, that the British
*11:01.880- 11:08.340* :  wanted to ensure that in the case of Japanese invasion, they wouldn't be able to get their hands
*11:08.500- 11:15.380* :  on food and sustenance for their soldiers, right? That's right. So they'd seen how the Japanese had
*11:15.380- 11:23.820* :  advanced through Southeast Asia by using local supplies, so transport and food in order to fuel
*11:23.820- 11:30.200* :  their advance. And so in order to prevent that happening in British India, they went to the Bengal
*11:30.200- 11:38.020* :  Delta to the villages and towns around there and took away surplus rice food supplies. And
*11:38.760- 11:44.140* :  boats, and what this meant was, it strained the already fragile economy, but with tens of
*11:44.180- 11:49.920* :  thousands of boats being confiscated or destroyed, it meant that fishermen couldn't fish, farmers
*11:49.920- 11:55.880* :  couldn't go to their land, artisans couldn't sell their wares, and critically rice couldn't be
*11:55.880- 12:04.680* :  moved around. Fair to say this was a man-made famine. Well, at the same time, in October 1942,
*12:04.680- 12:10.360* :  there was a devastating cyclone that left tens of thousands of people dead, but it also hit
*12:10.360- 12:17.940* :  some of the districts where rice was produced, and so the crop was destroyed. And so people argue
*12:17.940- 12:25.480* :  primarily a man-made famine, but there was also a natural disaster. Why isn't the Bengal famine
*12:25.480- 12:32.320* :  more widely known? Would you go as far to say that it's intentionally ignored? First of all,
*12:32.320- 12:37.000* :  in the UK and the wider West, but also there's an interesting story to tell about South Asia itself.
*12:38.280- 12:43.040* :  It is a really difficult bit of our colonial history that complicates our narrative of our
*12:43.040- 12:49.640* :  own war story, and so much of who we are in Britain is tied up with our war story. And then there
*12:49.640- 12:55.820* :  is the question of our wartime leader Winston Churchill, and did he do enough to alleviate
*12:56.440- 13:01.380* :  the famine once he knew about it in the middle of the war? And again, Winston Churchill
*13:02.000- 13:07.240* :  embodies who we are as a nation. You know, he fought heroically against the fascists and we won.
*13:08.020- 13:13.680* :  I would say that history is complicated and that we should be able to hold different
*13:14.040- 13:20.640* :  narratives at the same time. What I found really interesting that you tell us in your podcast is
*13:20.640- 13:28.220* :  that not only is this famine little spoken about in the UK, for example, but also in South Asia?
*13:29.460- 13:35.480* :  I would say it isn't it isn't. So there is no memorial or museum, not even a plaque to
*13:35.480- 13:43.320* :  these three million people who died anywhere in the world. And if you think that perhaps there might
*13:43.320- 13:51.360* :  be in India or Bangladesh and it just doesn't exist. But it is remembered in other ways. It's
*13:51.540- 13:56.340* :  remembered in iconic Indian films, it's remembered in photographs, it's remembered in fiction.
*13:57.260- 14:04.080* :  But again, this is history that is told by the observers to famine not in the voices of those
*14:04.080- 14:10.460* :  who suffered the most. And it's quite interesting because I spoke to Professor Shruti Kapila who
*14:10.460- 14:16.280* :  came to university and she said perhaps one of the reasons why the memory of those people
*14:16.280- 14:22.180* :  haven't been so well remembered is because the 1940s on the Indian subcontinent was this kind of
*14:22.180- 14:28.860* :  decade of death, mass death. You had the famine and then you had the great Kukka to killings
*14:29.240- 14:35.040* :  in 1946. A horrific communal violence between Muslims and Hindus in the run up to partition.
*14:35.040- 14:40.840* :  And then you have the partition of India. As the new dominions of Pakistan and India take over
*14:40.840- 14:46.200* :  their own affairs, communal hatred flares up in the Punjab. A fleeing from their blooted blood-stained
*14:46.200- 14:52.420* :  towns comes a new Exodus. Those that died in the famine were the voiceless, the forgotten,
*14:52.420- 14:58.700* :  the poorest. And that's what makes your work and your podcast so outstanding in the way that
*14:59.220- 15:04.980* :  these are voices that have never been really heard before. It's never been told in their voices.
*15:05.660- 15:14.420* :  They were the poorest and most vulnerable in society. And yes, I think you know people I spoke to
*15:14.740- 15:19.920* :  perhaps that's why they haven't been remembered. Or even their stories recorded.
*15:20.700- 15:26.860* :  There was, it was wartime, right? And there was an effort at the time to cover up what was
*15:26.860- 15:32.160* :  happening. Yeah, there was censorship on the ground in India. The emergency rules passed by the
*15:32.160- 15:37.780* :  government of India wouldn't allow the use of the word famine in publications because they feared
*15:37.780- 15:42.260* :  that the enemy, particularly the Japanese would use it as propaganda against them, which they did.
*15:43.040- 15:48.700* :  There was the one journalist in Bengal called Ian Stevens, right? And he did break the story
*15:48.700- 15:57.180* :  to the world. I really have very few visual memories of what was certainly the worst horror of
*15:57.180- 16:04.380* :  all in terms of death and suffering that is to say of the Bengal famine. I felt a sense of outrage
*16:04.380- 16:10.240* :  at the appalling suffering, which was occurring, and the inertia of the government in
*16:10.240- 16:14.780* :  tripping with it. Ian Stevens was the editor of the statesman newspaper, which was a British-owned
*16:14.780- 16:21.040* :  English-language newspaper in Calcutta, but read in Delhi and very well-regarded. And he discovered
*16:21.040- 16:28.020* :  a loophole in the censorship rules, which didn't mention anything about photographs. So he sent his
*16:28.160- 16:33.480* :  photographer out onto the streets of Calcutta. He very quickly came back with really distressing
*16:33.480- 16:39.820* :  photos, and they chose some, which would be palatable, but even those, they're pretty
*16:39.820- 16:48.700* :  full-on, and he published them on August 22, 1943. It wasn't long before people in London and
*16:48.700- 16:54.740* :  soon America knew what was happening, and he became emboldened and started writing,
*16:54.740- 17:00.680* :  scathing editorials, and publishing more photographs. And by mid-September, he was saying,
*17:00.820- 17:09.740* :  this is a man-made famine. What about Indian writers and journalists? How are they covering
*17:09.740- 17:17.640* :  the famine? Indian papers were reporting on it, but they were also some of them subject to the
*17:17.640- 17:23.580* :  censorship rules as well, so it wasn't very easy for them. But one pamphlet really kind of shook
*17:23.580- 17:29.840* :  me when I found it. It was by the writer and artist Chuchapasad Bhattacharya, and he had gone to
*17:29.840- 17:35.640* :  Midnapore, which was one of the areas really affected by the cyclone and the famine.
*17:36.860- 17:45.080* :  And he did sketches in ink of the victims and survivors, but he also gave a small biography of
*17:45.080- 17:50.820* :  them, who they were, where they came from. And he gave their names, and it was the first name
*17:50.820- 17:56.760* :  of a victim that I found, and I found it incredibly moving. The name of the person
*17:56.760- 18:04.860* :  was Kishit Ramahanaike, the picture that Chuchapasad drew. It's quite disturbing. He was already
*18:04.860- 18:12.640* :  being eaten alive by what looked like a wolf. The man no longer looks like a man anymore.
*18:15.120- 18:21.380* :  The number three million can just wash over you, but to find that name was so important,
*18:21.380- 18:29.520* :  and it just reminded me that the here survivor testimonies, to name names, is to give dignity
*18:29.620- 18:35.280* :  to those people who died. Absolutely. You've helped us understand
*18:35.340- 18:43.980* :  Kovita the sheer scale of that suffering, and also why this tragedy isn't better remembered.
*18:44.820- 18:50.040* :  Coming up, I'll be speaking to Kovita about the race to speak to survivors of the Bengal
*18:50.040- 18:56.160* :  famine before it's too late, so not just putting a name to the suffering, but giving the
*18:56.160- 19:01.740* :  suffering a voice as well. If you're enjoying what we're doing, and you'd like to hear more

*20:28.520- 20:34.460* :  journalist Kavita Puri about the incredible scale of suffering and death caused by the Bengal
*20:34.460- 20:41.300* :  famine. Kavita, what I'd really like to hear about now is the huge amount of work that you've
*20:41.300- 20:46.940* :  also been involved in recording, preserving the voices of witnesses and survivors 80 years after
*20:46.940- 20:53.600* :  the famine, something that just has never, ever happened today. You couldn't get a visa to go
*20:53.600- 21:00.260* :  yourself to talk, right? No, which is completely heartbreaking because I had found survivors,
*21:00.260- 21:07.060* :  this is like my whole mission was to speak to survivors and look into their eyes and see their
*21:07.060- 21:12.580* :  faces and I wasn't able to go. I haven't given up hope, but at the time it was hard for BBC
*21:12.580- 21:18.840* :  employees to get a visa to go to India. So tell me then about the man that you describe as the
*21:18.840- 21:25.620* :  memory collector. He really is a memory collector. His name is Soilin Sarge, he's 72 and he travels
*21:25.620- 21:30.880* :  around the Bengali countryside with his backpack in his open-toed sandals and his roll-up cigarettes
*21:30.880- 21:38.600* :  and he is basically looking for survivors of the famine and he records their testimonies with
*21:38.600- 21:44.480* :  paper and pen, kind of pretty old school ready and he's collected over 60 testimonies.
*21:45.560- 21:52.160* :  And as one of the people who kind of travel with him told me, you know, in the countryside is
*21:52.160- 21:59.940* :  the largest living archive in the world and no one has gone to ask people there what it was like.
*22:00.820- 22:04.100* :  This is what happened when he went to speak to one of the survivors.
*22:04.100- 22:11.560* :  When I went to him and asked about the famine, he passed it to the earth. The old man said then,
*22:11.960- 22:18.160* :  I am waiting for so much long that anyone will come to me and I will tell him the story.
*22:18.940- 22:22.120* :  But I still can remember his voice.
*22:28.100- 22:33.560* :  So many of the people that Soilin spoke to hadn't talked about it but they hadn't really even been
*22:33.560- 22:39.440* :  asked by their own families and so sometimes they were recounting their stories for the first time
*22:39.440- 22:46.820* :  to him. And these are some of the testimonies that Soilin has recorded but they obviously spoke to
*22:46.820- 22:52.420* :  him and Bengali and their voice here for us by actors. We had always had poverty here but that
*22:52.420- 22:59.720* :  year the crisis was devastating. Lots of people started begging to survive. Young girls or newly married
*22:59.720- 23:06.040* :  women didn't usually beg. The mothers would go instead. Still, this is hunger we're talking about.
*23:06.560- 23:12.880* :  How many rules can you follow? Many wives whose husbands couldn't feed them went back to their
*23:12.880- 23:17.520* :  father's houses. If they went to take them back, then they killed themselves.
*23:18.520- 23:25.680* :  People also talked to Soilin about things. I don't know if they felt guilty about them but they
*23:25.680- 23:33.520* :  told him stories that didn't always reflect them in a good light and how they themselves profited
*23:33.520- 23:39.380* :  from the famine like this man who had some money. He was a landowner in his village.
*23:40.000- 23:46.200* :  Since we had money, we bought up a lot of people's land for cheap at that time. We got land
*23:46.200- 23:53.560* :  for nothing in exchange for rice and dal or a little money. We got all the land registered in
*23:53.560- 24:01.020* :  our name. Soon after hunger struck, people began to get sick. One household was left without a single
*24:01.020- 24:08.960* :  east. We took their land. As powerful, Kavita, do you feel that this really is a time
*24:09.020- 24:15.140* :  where we are beginning to hear different narratives about colonial history but about so many
*24:15.140- 24:20.340* :  things in the world, different voices and challenging the traditional narratives that have
*24:20.340- 24:25.540* :  gone before. I'm thinking about that huge period that we've had in the US, but in many countries
*24:25.540- 24:31.120* :  across Europe, including the UK, where statues are beginning to be torn down of individuals
*24:31.120- 24:36.200* :  who beforehand were seen as well respected founders of towns, cities, universities.
*24:37.560- 24:44.860* :  I think you're right. I think things are changing and I feel lucky to be alive when that
*24:44.860- 24:52.740* :  change is happening. I have always approached this kind of history through eyewitness accounts
*24:52.740- 25:00.540* :  because I think there is something about hearing events through people's voices that gets you
*25:00.540- 25:08.220* :  behind the statistics. Every single person who died, there is a story and I think that when you hear
*25:08.220- 25:17.160* :  people's stories, you can connect with people and you can feel empathy or some kind of emotion.
*25:17.740- 25:23.220* :  And I hope that's going to be the case with the famine. I say it's history. It's not a history
*25:23.220- 25:28.040* :  for some people. Some people are still alive who remember that. Some of them live in our country
*25:28.040- 25:33.820* :  today. Pamela is still alive. She remembers it. It's not their history. It's their life. They
*25:33.820- 25:40.560* :  recall it very, very clearly. But we have to find a way and we have to find a language in which we
*25:40.560- 25:47.140* :  can talk about these things and I don't think it should be about guilt or blame. But I do think we
*25:47.140- 25:53.240* :  should know because it's our history. It was British India. It's British history and it's part
*25:53.240- 25:59.740* :  of the story of the war too. And I'm really happy that the Imperial War Museum and their new galleries
*25:59.740- 26:04.960* :  has featured the Bengal famine. But it's never thought about in terms of our war story.
*26:05.460- 26:10.760* :  But that's new, right? When I went to the Imperial War Museum when I was at school which
*26:10.760- 26:18.520* :  was a little while ago. It didn't feature then. It's very new. But I also think the younger generation
*26:18.600- 26:23.600* :  are asking really, really different questions. And they're more comfortable with the complexities
*26:23.600- 26:31.140* :  of history. But I also think it's significant that the third generation in the diaspora are also
*26:31.140- 26:38.940* :  asking questions. It's because it's their history. We will at some time be learning about this in
*26:38.940- 26:43.700* :  schools. We're not in England yet. It's not compulsory. And I just hope we can do it in a way
*26:43.700- 26:49.200* :  that's not so fraught because these things happened. You know, we should be able to see that in a
*26:49.200- 26:55.000* :  textbook. I think one of the valuable lessons from from your work, Kavita, on the famine is
*26:55.360- 27:00.140* :  that yes, we are beginning to hear different narratives and different voices. And the UK is
*27:00.320- 27:04.880* :  revisiting its colonial past and looking at it with different eyes. But again, we might make
*27:04.880- 27:11.280* :  assumptions. So if I think about the colonial past, I think about people who were oppressed or
*27:11.280- 27:16.820* :  had riches taken from their country perhaps. But it was quite leveling. One of the main points of
*27:16.820- 27:24.840* :  your podcast is that you say that for those in India who were colonised by the British, the main
*27:24.840- 27:30.400* :  thing that they associate with colonial rule is not nothing to do with politics. It's hunger.
*27:31.240- 27:37.420* :  Yeah. So Professor Shruti Kapila, who I spoke to, she said one of the enduring legacies of
*27:37.540- 27:42.380* :  empire is hunger. That's her view. And I was quite surprised to hear that. No, I hadn't
*27:42.380- 27:47.260* :  thought of it in that way because the 1943 famine isn't the only famine. There were other
*27:47.260- 27:53.920* :  famines too. And, you know, the reasons for that are incredibly contested. But, you know, they
*27:53.920- 28:02.300* :  happened during Britain's presence in India. And so she talks about freedom from the British
*28:02.300- 28:09.720* :  being freedom from hunger and how the memory of the famine has played into agricultural policy
*28:09.760- 28:16.080* :  today. And that is certainly how they see the legacy of empire.
*28:17.200- 28:23.140* :  Kavita, thank you for guiding us through the complexities and putting voices to those who suffered
*28:23.140- 28:26.380* :  in the Bengal famine. Thank you. Thank you, Katia.
*28:31.080- 28:36.160* :  And thank you all for listening. Remember, normally the global story won't be in the global news
