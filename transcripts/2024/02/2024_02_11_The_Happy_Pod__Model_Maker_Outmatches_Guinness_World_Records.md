*00:45.420- 00:49.600* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mint Mobile. You know, it's hard to believe that inflation is still a thing,
*00:49.600- 00:54.740* :  but boy it sure is, and that's exactly why Mint Mobile still gives you premium wireless for
*00:54.740- 01:01.020* :  just $15 a month. Well, it's also because we have that offer printed on, like a million t-shirts,
*01:01.020- 01:06.140* :  but it's mostly the inflation thing, so give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*01:41.620- 01:44.340* :  This is The Happy Pond from the BBC World Service.
*01:49.320- 01:53.640* :  I'm Jacquie Leonard, and this edition is uploaded on Sunday the 11th of February.
*01:53.640- 01:57.120* :  Yes, a day later than usual, it isn't you, and this is why.
*02:00.400- 02:05.180* :  We'll have our guide to the Lunar New Year festivities. The French model maker,
*02:05.880- 02:09.700* :  celebrating a record-breaking achievement after nearly missing out on a technicality.
*02:13.240- 02:17.340* :  We're also celebrating the wonder of music from this magnificent sound.
*02:22.320- 02:24.080* :  To the 2024 Grammys.
*02:24.700- 02:31.480* :  She does feel like she could be the next Rihanna, so that award almost felt like an anointing of a new
*02:31.480- 02:37.080* :  star. Also in this podcast, if Birdsong is your thing, we have the Uganda Women Birders Club.
*02:37.340- 02:43.940* :  We get the leddies to learn how to do bad watching, and as such, they can add a livelihood for their
*02:44.380- 02:47.460* :  families. And can you tell the sound of a happy chicken?
*02:52.920- 02:57.860* :  We begin with an emotional rollercoaster for French model maker, Risha Plot.
*02:58.280- 03:03.920* :  He dedicated eight years of his life to creating a huge matchstick Eiffel Tower,
*03:04.540- 03:09.640* :  only to be initially denied the Guinness World Record for using the wrong kind of match.
*03:09.640- 03:13.560* :  Now they have reversed the decision and awarded him the record after all.
*03:13.800- 03:15.040* :  Yusko Field is in Paris.
*03:15.680- 03:16.960* :  All is well, that ends well.
*03:17.380- 03:24.220* :  Risha Plot spent eight years building his 7.2 metre Eiffel Tower using 700,000 matches,
*03:24.680- 03:29.580* :  only to be told earlier this week that it didn't qualify for the Guinness Book because he'd bulk
*03:29.580- 03:35.340* :  bought the matchsticks without their red heads. According to the record keepers that was not allowed,
*03:35.340- 03:41.100* :  only commercially bought matches were permitted, which the model maker had to individually treat
*03:41.100- 03:46.600* :  by scratching off the sulphur. But then came the good news, after Risha Plot filed an appeal,
*03:47.000- 03:48.360* :  the authorities relented.
*03:51.080- 03:55.920* :  It's an emotional rollercoaster. I mean, for eight years, I've always thought that I was
*03:55.920- 04:00.840* :  building a tallest matchstick structure, and at the end of these eight years, the initial decision
*04:00.840- 04:07.080* :  made by the Guinness Book of World Records, I found it too strict, cruel, and I felt it incomprehensible.
*04:07.480- 04:12.000* :  After all the media fast, the Guinness Book people obviously felt that their rules needed updating.
*04:12.000- 04:15.920* :  Mark McKinley is their director of central records services.
*04:16.300- 04:22.140* :  We're really excited to be able to approve it. Like we say, when we were able to look at the
*04:22.140- 04:27.640* :  amount of dedication that went into it and see the amount of work into it, you know, eight years
*04:28.580- 04:35.460* :  of toil, just to get to where he was. It's incredible, absolutely incredible. We're happy to be
*04:35.460- 04:42.260* :  able to admit that we were a little bit too harsh on the type of matches needed in this attempt,
*04:42.260- 04:45.940* :  and Richard's attempt truly is officially amazing.
*04:46.380- 04:52.020* :  So, effort has been properly rewarded. A Fusty Rule has been changed, and Risha Plot
*04:52.380- 04:59.400* :  has made the biggest matchstick Eiffel Tower of all time. Well, he knew he had, but now it's official.
*05:00.260- 05:05.680* :  Huesco Field in Paris. Now some excellent news for music lovers and sports fans,
*05:05.680- 05:10.600* :  well Scottish ones anyway, because it's been confirmed that this magnificent sound will be
*05:10.600- 05:15.300* :  reverberating around football pitches this June at the 2024 European Championship.
*05:22.100- 05:26.280* :  Backpipes, obviously, being played there at the start of a rugby international.
*05:26.280- 05:32.080* :  The governing body of European football UEFA had issued guidelines barring mechanical sound
*05:32.080- 05:36.460* :  emitting devices from fixtures, but it's now relented and says the pipes will be permitted
*05:36.840- 05:41.420* :  as long as they're registered with the Scottish Football Association. Piper and football fan Martin
*05:41.420- 05:47.080* :  Brown is pretty pleased. There are initial rulings where anything that makes a mechanical noise,
*05:47.080- 05:54.280* :  I think it was going back to the World Cup in South Africa with the Vivisios, and that just
*05:54.280- 06:00.320* :  annoyed us for what everybody in the world. So, the brother, there's no mechanical noise making
*06:00.320- 06:05.880* :  machines to be allowed in. However, there's obviously a look to the backpipes and it's a traditional
*06:05.880- 06:10.720* :  part of Scotland, then Scotland football matches, so they've said, yeah, as long as they're
*06:10.720- 06:15.840* :  registered with the SFA, then that's absolutely fine to bring them. This might astonish you,
*06:15.840- 06:23.200* :  Martin, but not everybody appreciates backpipes the way that you and I do, and some people might find...
*06:23.320- 06:27.780* :  I know that. I know it's amazing, isn't it? Some people might find backpipes annoying, but tell me
*06:27.780- 06:34.220* :  about why backpipes move you. What is it about backpipes that you really love?
*06:35.160- 06:40.880* :  Honestly, it's just the traditional from the sound of them. I mean, if you hear certain tunes
*06:40.880- 06:45.240* :  getting played on the backpipes, even still now you hear a certain tune getting played in the
*06:45.240- 06:52.060* :  hairs on the back of my neck stand up, it's hard to explain what it is. And what sort of tunes would
*06:52.060- 06:59.880* :  you play to get your team going to give them a boost to get them fired up? The most obvious one
*06:59.920- 07:04.780* :  is the National Anthem, the Flour of Scotland. I mean, as soon as you start playing that on the
*07:04.780- 07:11.080* :  backpipes at the football, the whole crowd joins in, and it's just an incredible sound.
*07:12.140- 07:18.180* :  Best example I could give you was when we were playing Norway and Oslo last year, and we were one
*07:18.180- 07:22.760* :  now down, we have about two, three minutes to go. I started up and started playing Flour of Scotland,
*07:23.880- 07:29.440* :  the whole crowd joined in, and the team obviously got a lift from it, because we went on
*07:29.440- 07:34.760* :  discourse two goals in the last three, four minutes, but it's just such an amazing sound.
*07:35.540- 07:42.300* :  Martin Brown. Welcome to the Year of the Dragon. Millions of people are celebrating the Lunar
*07:42.300- 07:47.780* :  New Year, and here's Kerry Allen, our China media analyst, with your guide to the festivities.
*07:52.420- 07:56.640* :  It's traditionally a time when families get together and they exchange presents off money
*07:56.640- 08:01.820* :  in a red envelope. They will also sit down to have a big feast, so in a way it's quite similar to
*08:01.820- 08:07.700* :  Christmas while Thanksgiving. Many cities will host firework or drone displays. This year is the
*08:07.700- 08:12.460* :  Year of the Dragon, one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. If you were born in the years
*08:12.460- 08:22.660* :  1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000 or 2012, you're a dragon. It's considered one of the luckiest
*08:22.660- 08:27.740* :  zodiac signs, and people born in the year at the dragon are seen as clever, charming, powerful,
*08:27.740- 08:33.400* :  and wise. Live in the 1st of January, the Lunar New Year is meant to symbolise a fresh start,
*08:33.700- 08:38.360* :  and there are some customs that people commonly observe to have a lucky year ahead. So what can you
*08:38.360- 08:44.400* :  do? Well, wearing red is considered to be lucky to see in the New Year. It's not a day for cleaning,
*08:44.400- 08:49.680* :  avoid cutting or washing your hair or using a broom. You might brush away the new look that is
*08:49.680- 08:54.240* :  coming your way. And if you're thinking of having a meal, noodles are considered lucky as they
*08:54.240- 09:00.680* :  symbolise a long life. Don't plan to symbolise wealth, and fish symbolises abundance. To all our
*09:00.680- 09:04.500* :  listeners, Xinjiang Quailer, Gonghe Fat Choi, Happy New Year.
*09:10.500- 09:15.240* :  And for a more in-depth examination of the Lunar New Year, Celia Hatton has her own podcast,
*09:15.240- 09:17.360* :  and you will find it wherever you found this one.

*10:48.920- 10:53.740* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*10:53.740- 10:59.920* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*11:00.060- 11:07.480* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
*11:08.500- 11:14.880* :  I'm Una Chaplin, and from CBC podcasts and the BBC World Service, this is Hollywood Exiles.
*11:15.560- 11:19.260* :  Search for Hollywood Exiles, wherever you get your podcasts.
*11:20.260- 11:26.000* :  Now let's hear about that huge celebration of music that is the Grammys. All the biggest names
*11:26.000- 11:30.720* :  in the music industry were there, they were moving and thrilling live performances,
*11:30.720- 11:34.680* :  history was made, and millions around the world watched,
*11:35.040- 11:40.240* :  including our music correspondent Mark Savage. And let's start with the introduction of an
*11:40.240- 11:45.600* :  award for the best African music performance. And the question of why is it taken so long?
*11:46.520- 11:52.760* :  I think one of the reasons is that Afrobeats and Amapiano, the two big genres in Africa,
*11:52.760- 11:57.500* :  at the moment, have really had a breakthrough couple of years on the global charts,
*11:57.960- 12:02.860* :  rather than being confined to Nigeria, where Afrobeats has a huge hold on the market,
*12:02.860- 12:08.220* :  and Amapiano, which comes from South Africa. And the Grammys just decided this was the moment
*12:08.220- 12:12.920* :  when they had gone mainstream enough to be deserving of an award. But interestingly,
*12:12.920- 12:19.380* :  the first prize went to Tyler, who is brand new. She had this massive viral hit over last summer,
*12:19.380- 12:22.080* :  and towards the end of last year, with a song called Water.
*12:33.020- 12:39.040* :  And she does feel like she could be the next Rihanna. So that award almost felt like an
*12:39.040- 12:44.300* :  anointing of a new star, rather than a recognition of the people who had paved the way for her.
*12:45.000- 12:48.220* :  And we can't talk about the Grammys mark without talking Taylor.
*12:48.920- 12:54.120* :  No, I mean, the Grammys just can't stop giving her prizes, it's like they're addicted to it.
*13:01.260- 13:06.920* :  This was her fourth album of the year, when nobody else has ever had that many prizes for
*13:06.920- 13:13.480* :  album of the year. Previously, Taylor was tied with Paul Simon, with Frank Sinatra, and with Stevie
*13:13.480- 13:18.540* :  Wonder. And you know, she's the first woman to do this, you notice all those other three-time winners
*13:18.540- 13:25.500* :  are men. That's a really significant step, not just for the music industry, but for society in general.
*13:26.380- 13:33.740* :  Let's talk a little bit about the actual Grammy night, and something which moved so many people,
*13:33.740- 13:40.720* :  Tracy Chapman, singing Fast Car. This was incredible. Last year, the country singer Luke Combs
*13:41.020- 13:47.020* :  had a massive hit just by covering Tracy Chapman's Fast Car. A song that originally came out in the
*13:47.020- 13:53.160* :  late 1980s, and it's the story of essentially trying to escape poverty, wanting to flee the
*13:53.160- 13:59.960* :  horrible situation that you are in. But she has been in semi-retirement since 2009, and it took
*13:59.960- 14:06.200* :  five months of negotiation to get her to appear with Luke Combs at the Grammy Awards. And when she
*14:06.200- 14:13.580* :  did, as the camera panned back from her, there was just this absolutely gorgeous smile on her face.
*14:13.580- 14:27.000* :  She played that iconic riff on an acoustic guitar, and she looked so happy to be there,
*14:27.380- 14:32.900* :  and you could see Luke Combs standing beside her, just kind of watching in awe as she delivered
*14:32.900- 14:37.240* :  this song, because he was so pleased to be sharing the stage with her. And you could see in the
*14:37.240- 14:43.480* :  audience as well the reception to that moment, people just felt so pleased to have her back.
*14:43.480- 14:49.620* :  It was a really heartwarming thing to see. Tracy Chapman, of course, not the only figure to come
*14:49.620- 14:55.740* :  out of semi-retirement for a performance? No, we had Joni Mitchell on stage at the age of 80.
*14:56.520- 15:01.040* :  A hugely significant moment for the Grammys, because she'd never performed there before,
*15:01.620- 15:07.920* :  but also because about a decade ago, Joni Mitchell had a life-changing brain aneurysm. She lost the
*15:07.920- 15:12.480* :  power of speech. She lost the ability to walk. There was a question over whether she would ever
*15:12.480- 15:18.340* :  be able to perform again. And she's had an intense couple of years of rehabilitation,
*15:18.620- 15:24.880* :  and she came out and she had a kind of comeback concert two years ago at the Newport Folk Festival,
*15:24.880- 15:30.400* :  which is where she had her start. The recording of that concert won a Grammy on Sunday night,
*15:30.800- 15:36.380* :  and she was tempted back on stage to play both sides now, one of her most beautiful and affecting
*15:49.700- 15:53.760* :  songs. But even more beautiful and affecting this time around, because after everything that
*15:53.760- 16:00.480* :  she's been through, the lyrics of this song talk about taking stock of life, the highs and the
*16:00.480- 16:05.000* :  lows, the things that have happened to you, the way that you've changed and how you emerge
*16:05.800- 16:13.020* :  as a more rounded, a more contented person. And to hear her, after that brutal and terrible 10
*16:13.020- 16:19.860* :  years, able to sing that song again, to see her smile and tapping her cane on the floor and enjoying
*16:19.860- 16:25.380* :  that moment, was one of the most moving musical performances I have ever seen.
*16:26.500- 16:33.200* :  That was Mark Savage, our music correspondent. There was a time in Uganda when bird-watching and
*16:33.200- 16:39.060* :  careers in nature were considered masculine occupations, but a determined band of women set out
*16:39.060- 16:44.780* :  to enable their sisters to share in the beauty and career potential of their country's forests and
*16:44.780- 16:51.520* :  wetlands, and their number has steadily grown. Judith Murember is the pioneer chairperson of Uganda
*16:51.540- 16:59.000* :  women's birders. We started as a small group of 10 people, and over the years the group has
*16:59.000- 17:06.180* :  bred across the country. So what we do is mentor young women into nature guiding, which has
*17:06.180- 17:13.840* :  likely been a male-dominated professional. So we get the leddies to learn how to do bird-watching,
*17:13.840- 17:20.900* :  and as such they can earn a livelihood for their families. Obviously you have an exciting and
*17:20.900- 17:28.680* :  large bird population in Uganda. If people were to look up just one Ugandan bird, if they
*17:28.680- 17:36.040* :  wanted to see one bird that you would really, really like them to know about, what would that bird be?
*17:36.720- 17:43.100* :  The shoe bill. So the shoe bill is a globally threatened species. It's found in a few countries
*17:43.100- 17:49.200* :  in Africa, and Uganda offers one of the best opportunities to see this prehistoric dinosaur
*17:49.200- 17:56.920* :  looking bird. It's a awkward looking but yet very intriguing to look at, and it sounds just like
*17:56.920- 18:07.620* :  a machine gun. But considering the habitat, it tries. It's a bit cryptic, so you may not easily
*18:07.620- 18:13.300* :  spot it among the barbarous, but the minute you spot it you feel like you have overcome a challenge
*18:13.300- 18:19.960* :  like you have won. Okay, I can't find the word. You've won a prize.
*18:20.380- 18:27.680* :  I can't find it. Yes, my life keeps. Have you always loved birds when you were a little girl?
*18:27.680- 18:31.760* :  Were you fascinated by them? What do you get out of observing them?
*18:32.820- 18:38.800* :  As a little girl, I love birds, but not the way I appreciate them now. As a little girl,
*18:38.800- 18:44.860* :  I appreciated them because of the folk tales and the stories that our mothers and grandmothers
*18:44.860- 18:53.200* :  told us about the birds. So I'm based a bird called the Pintail Dwighta. It's a small
*18:53.200- 18:59.880* :  black and white bird with a long tail and a ready-ish pill. So oftentimes when you see a Pintail
*18:59.880- 19:06.500* :  Dwighta, it's one male, and then you have a bunch of females following it. So growing up, who are
*19:06.500- 19:12.420* :  told that if a boy plucks such a feather and keeps it in his pockets, all the girls who come
*19:12.420- 19:19.720* :  flocking to him and following him. So it was really funny that of course at that edge, you believed
*19:21.200- 19:28.980* :  because it all seemed true. And then there's another bird called the Long Crestedigo
*19:29.500- 19:34.980* :  that were told you can ask which direction you're going to marry. It has a long crest on the head.
*19:35.760- 19:40.960* :  So depending on where the crest points, if it points west, it means you're going to get married
*19:40.960- 19:48.780* :  in the west, if it points east, it means east. So listening to all this over a fireplace or
*19:49.680- 19:55.000* :  when you're in the garden, all this was interesting and it all seemed true because you hear it from
*19:55.000- 20:02.180* :  the people you trust. Judith Marumbe of the Uganda Women's Birders Club. And I will share a picture
*20:02.180- 20:08.020* :  of the shoe bill online on farting many social media platforms. And speaking of our feathered friends,
*20:08.860- 20:13.440* :  how do you think this chicken is feeling? And what about this one?
*20:18.640- 20:23.940* :  Now you might not be able to tell the difference between a happy or a frustrated chicken from those
*20:23.940- 20:30.680* :  clocks, but Victoria Gill has been speaking to someone who can enter Clive Phillips, Australia's
*20:30.680- 20:38.380* :  first professor of animal welfare. We trained them to go through a special door and then to get a
*20:38.380- 20:44.720* :  reward. And the rewarded chickens would get either some food or what they really liked was to have
*20:44.720- 20:50.140* :  a meal worm. But some of the chickens didn't get anything and they were the ones that displayed
*20:50.140- 20:55.760* :  these rather frustrated and unhappy calls. But how did you carry out the study? How did you test
*20:55.760- 21:03.840* :  whether people could tell the difference? Well, we prepared a file which had six calls and it was
*21:03.840- 21:09.200* :  sent around to close on a couple of hundred people and we also asked the people whether they had
*21:09.200- 21:15.220* :  experience with the chickens and asked them whether the calls they were hearing were from rewarded
*21:15.220- 21:21.720* :  chickens or whether they felt they were under-awarded. What did you find? It didn't really matter
*21:21.720- 21:26.540* :  whether people had experience or not, which was quite surprising. We asked them all sorts of
*21:26.540- 21:31.500* :  questions about whether they had kept chickens, whether they had any involvement in chickens,
*21:32.300- 21:37.180* :  and that had no significant effect on whether they could tell the difference between happy and sad
*21:37.180- 21:45.240* :  calls at all. And why for birds for poultry is that particularly important? Is this measure using
*21:45.240- 21:51.160* :  sound in this way, using listening to their calls? Is welfare by other measures more difficult
*21:51.160- 21:57.400* :  for poultry than for birds? It is. It's substantially more difficult than, for example, going onto a
*21:57.400- 22:02.420* :  dairy farm where you might go to look at the individual cows and see if they're lame or not,
*22:02.420- 22:11.560* :  but with chickens you've probably got 10, 20 or even 30,000 birds in one unit and almost impossible
*22:11.560- 22:17.780* :  to see from looking at individuals how happy they are. So we need to be able to determine that
*22:18.360- 22:23.820* :  accurately and quickly. And what about how we can apply this then? You talked about using
*22:24.060- 22:30.480* :  sounds in an animal welfare setting for being able to assess animal welfare. How could you do that
*22:30.480- 22:37.280* :  in practice? Well, it's not going to be easy, but assuming that all the chickens in these large
*22:37.280- 22:44.580* :  chicken sheds are behaving in a fairly similar way, then it's likely that we could detect from the
*22:44.580- 22:50.800* :  frequency whether they are happy or sad. And that could even be done automatically. And in this day
*22:50.800- 22:59.000* :  and age of artificial intelligence taking much stronger place in detecting welfare on farm, it may be
*22:59.000- 23:05.420* :  that in the future we can do this automatically. And just briefly any insights into what sort of
*23:05.560- 23:11.240* :  stimulation, what enrichment are easily given to chickens that would make their lives a little
*23:11.240- 23:15.540* :  bit richer and keep them sort of happily chatting away? One of the best things, of course,
*23:15.620- 23:21.960* :  that chicken farmers can do is to have their chickens outside in in fields. But if the farmer is
*23:21.960- 23:29.140* :  stuck with a shed with thousands of birds in it, one thing he can do is hang choice bits of food
*23:29.140- 23:34.100* :  from the ceiling, which the birds have to jump up and get. And the birds absolutely love it and
*23:34.100- 23:40.140* :  they'll jump off the ground to take these choice food items. Now the biggest question on my mind
*23:40.140- 23:45.320* :  after that conversation was, do my chicken sound happy? So I spent some time doing a little taste
*23:45.380- 23:51.360* :  test with them. Hello, ladies. Right, let's see what you think of all this.
*23:55.340- 24:01.800* :  Quite like those. Well, I wanted to get the official expert opinion, so I sent that little clip
*24:01.800- 24:06.920* :  to Clive or animal welfare and chicken pluck experts and he very kindly sent this message in response.
*24:07.520- 24:14.340* :  These are definitely happy chickens. They love having little treats. What a life they are having.
*24:15.080- 24:20.440* :  That was Clive Phillips and he was talking to Victoria Gill. And just in case you hadn't worked it
*24:20.440- 24:24.900* :  out already, the first clip that we played was a happy chicken and the second one wasn't.
*24:25.960- 24:30.060* :  Now, some of the other things that caught our attention this week, this will interest you if you
*24:30.060- 24:37.160* :  don't like needles. Scientists, Ji Hyun Lee and her colleagues at Song Yun Guan University in South
*24:37.160- 24:43.700* :  Korea have taken some bioinspiration from octopus tentacles and come up with a flexible patch covered
*24:43.700- 24:49.520* :  in suction cups like the suckers on octopus limbs that can pucker the skin and enable drugs to get
*24:49.520- 24:54.860* :  through without breaking the skin or causing irritation. After the delight we took in a fugitive
*24:54.860- 25:00.100* :  monkey in Scotland last week, honorable mention to a barbery macaque that crossed from Gibraltar
*25:00.380- 25:06.660* :  into La Linaia in Spain on Monday morning. He was picked up late on Tuesday after a huge co-operative
*25:06.660- 25:11.700* :  effort involving officers from the Spanish Civil Guards Conservation Unit, police officers,
*25:11.700- 25:17.700* :  representatives from the Castelar Conservation Zoo and members of Gibraltar's macaque management team.
*25:17.700- 25:23.200* :  And yes, as monkeys all want to do, this one also prompted a flurry of jokes on social media.
*25:23.760- 25:30.220* :  And our thanks to Vanessa, who told us about a bald-headed eagle called Jackie at Big Bear Lake
*25:30.220- 25:35.520* :  in California. She and her mate Shado have got three eggs now and you can watch their nest
*25:35.520- 25:40.840* :  on the Friends of Big Bear Lake website and I am now strangely invested in this eagle.
*25:41.740- 25:47.460* :  Now, we've had something of a musical theme in this edition. Let's wrap up on a similar note,
*25:47.460- 25:53.400* :  a study on the physical effects of music. On the way it can make us want to either curl up in a
*25:53.400- 26:00.200* :  ball or get up and dance. Research conducted at the University of Turku in Finland maps out
*26:00.200- 26:06.900* :  where different musical forms hit home so sad music was felt physically by the study's participants
*26:06.900- 26:12.360* :  in the chest and head and happy music was felt in their legs, their hands and their arms.
*26:13.000- 26:17.340* :  Gemma Kerney, a BBC DJ and a documentary maker says it makes sense.
*26:18.320- 26:24.580* :  I'm pretty sensitive to music and can definitely testify to its power having done so many
*26:24.580- 26:30.560* :  different radio shows for over a decade. You can literally press play and change the mood
*26:31.080- 26:35.880* :  of many, many humans. And change the mood that you feel in different parts of your body.
*26:35.880- 26:38.320* :  That's the interesting thing the researchers have come up with.
*26:38.820- 26:44.040* :  I'm really glad that there is more scientific research in the logic behind this because it's
*26:44.040- 26:49.100* :  definitely something that I feel within my soul. I was thinking about genres personally.
*26:49.680- 26:56.540* :  And for me it's very much about soul music because I think developing a language for our emotions
*26:56.720- 27:06.980* :  can be felt in our bodies. For example, the Schmultzi lovely romantic heartfelt Adele can be felt
*27:06.980- 27:14.640* :  in your heart. And I think that these components and music universally give us those anchors
*27:14.640- 27:20.780* :  and that language to be able to speak more about how we do kind of live from a sole place and
*27:21.120- 27:27.080* :  can move emotions and feelings through our bodies and an actual physical movement too.
*27:27.080- 27:32.080* :  It's all so connected. Yeah, and connected in a way that can do us good. You think of the obvious
*27:32.080- 27:37.500* :  ways in which music nourishes us, but also that actually can get you going physically.
*27:39.520- 27:45.760* :  Definitely. I mean, when we associate our bodies with exercise, we understand that we can
*27:46.260- 27:53.200* :  create endorphins. And if dancing is an exercise to upbeat music, then I don't know what is.
*27:53.360- 27:58.920* :  You could definitely burn off some calories on a dance floor. And music is the aid for that,
*27:58.920- 28:05.460* :  the beat, the tempo, the melody, the singing your heart out. It's such a physical thing to do
*28:05.460- 28:09.980* :  and to immerse yourself in. You wonder how universal it is because, of course, different cultures
*28:09.980- 28:15.340* :  around the world. You think of Eastern music and the way in which an atonal music and all sorts
*28:15.340- 28:20.320* :  of things that kind of play into this, but they play on our bodies in ways that we haven't yet
*28:20.320- 28:27.540* :  thought about. Absolutely. I've made many documentaries for the world service about different
*28:27.540- 28:34.600* :  music from a different perspective, whether that's ancient wisdom or religious practice or cultural
*28:34.600- 28:40.760* :  exchange and share where you may have a language barrier between two musicians, but they can talk
*28:40.760- 28:49.240* :  through an instrument. And I can also physically remember, for example, learning about polyphonic
*28:49.480- 28:55.620* :  choir singing, throat singing in Georgia and hearing it on repeat in quite a windowless building
*28:55.620- 29:01.040* :  for an afternoon. When I made a documentary there called The Sound Odyssey, I felt pretty sleepy
*29:01.040- 29:07.860* :  because the sound was so melancholic. It happened that change is my body and I think, you know,
*29:07.860- 29:16.160* :  we can all relate to this depending on the tone of the music, the color of the music. We feel it
*29:16.380- 29:20.240* :  inside. Gemma Kerney and she was talking to Justin Webb.
