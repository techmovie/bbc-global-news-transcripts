*00:00.060- 00:04.020* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:04.020- 00:06.580* :  with reports and analysis from across the world,
*00:06.580- 00:08.740* :  the latest news seven days a week.
*00:08.740- 00:12.620* :  BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.520- 00:18.780* :  Why don't more infant formula companies use organic,
*00:18.780- 00:20.800* :  grass-fed whole milk instead of skin?
*00:21.520- 00:25.020* :  Why don't more infant formula companies use the latest breast milk science?
*00:25.800- 00:28.940* :  Why don't more infant formula companies run their own clinical trials?
*00:29.640- 00:33.360* :  Why don't more infant formula companies use more of the proteins found in breast milk?
*00:33.420- 00:38.680* :  Why don't more infant formula companies have their own factories instead of outsourcing their manufacturing?
*00:39.420- 00:40.700* :  We wondered the same thing.
*00:41.120- 00:43.700* :  So we made By Heart, a better formula for formula.

*00:46.360- 00:47.080* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:47.080- 00:51.040* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:51.280- 00:53.700* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:54.020- 00:57.620* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*00:57.620- 01:01.420* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:01.680- 01:06.700* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:19.100- 01:22.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.820- 01:28.840* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 14th of June,
*01:28.880- 01:30.340* :  these are our main stories.
*01:30.920- 01:34.700* :  South Africa agrees a historic coalition government after the
*01:34.700- 01:38.120* :  centre-right democratic alliance says it will join the ANC.
*01:38.680- 01:43.320* :  G7 leaders focus on tensions with China on the second day of their summit in Italy.
*01:45.720- 01:50.540* :  Also in this podcast, how three oil tankers went missing in Thailand and
*01:52.380- 01:52.900* :  China.
*01:55.880- 01:59.880* :  Why this Japanese pop group has got into trouble over a music video.
*02:02.960- 02:07.800* :  South Africa's ANC has signed a deal with the other largest party in parliament,
*02:07.800- 02:11.240* :  the democratic alliance to form a government of national unity.
*02:11.420- 02:17.200* :  The historic agreement comes after the ANC lost its overall majority in elections last month.
*02:17.200- 02:21.900* :  The party of Nelson Mandela has been the largest since the end of a part eight
*02:21.900- 02:27.900* :  30 years ago. The leader of the DA, John Steenhayson, said the coalition would chart a new
*02:27.900- 02:33.800* :  course. He said the pact paved the way for the re-election of Cyril Ramaposa for his second
*02:33.800- 02:37.920* :  and final term. The government of national unity's presidential candidate
*02:38.660- 02:43.980* :  will come from the largest party inside the grouping, being President Cyril Ramaposa.
*02:45.520- 02:49.940* :  Following his election today, President Ramaposa will then exercise his prerogative
*02:50.480- 02:54.920* :  to appoint his new cabinet, from among the members of the government of national unity
*02:55.460- 02:59.000* :  in consultation with the leaders of the constituent parties.
*02:59.380- 03:03.040* :  For more, I spoke to our correspondent, Namsa Misaka, who's in Cape Town.
*03:03.360- 03:07.620* :  In fact, just a few minutes ago, the leader of the democratic alliance,
*03:07.620- 03:14.880* :  John Steenhayson confirmed that a deal has finally been reached with the ANC and that the
*03:15.040- 03:22.580* :  DA will vote with the ANC today when the election of a president comes up later this afternoon.
*03:24.060- 03:29.320* :  Mr. Steenhayson also said that there are no positions that have been allocated or even
*03:29.320- 03:36.040* :  discussed, but we understand that the DA has demanded strategic ministerial positions, including
*03:36.040- 03:42.620* :  the justice and mineral resources and energy portfolios, and that there is a possibility that
*03:42.620- 03:47.840* :  the democratic alliance will have at least five to six ministerial positions,
*03:48.480- 03:52.960* :  along with the other coalition partners, which include the Incad,
*03:53.040- 04:01.460* :  a freedom party that has 17 seats in parliament, and also the patriotic alliance that has two seats.
*04:02.200- 04:08.000* :  The ANC and the democratic alliance are not natural bedfellows, are they? I mean,
*04:08.000- 04:11.520* :  the democratic alliance was long seen as the party of the white people.
*04:11.920- 04:18.620* :  Absolutely, there are huge ideological differences between the two political parties.
*04:18.620- 04:25.560* :  The ANC has long been advocating for policies such as the Black Economic Empowerment Policy,
*04:26.120- 04:30.680* :  which seeks to redress the injustices of the countries of party past.
*04:30.680- 04:37.700* :  They're also talking about land redistribution and the DA is opposing those policies,
*04:38.380- 04:43.900* :  and also wanting to do away with basic wages for people in South Africa.
*04:44.380- 04:51.980* :  So there are a lot of ideological differences, which have made analysts believe that this
*04:51.980- 05:00.560* :  coalition government may not last to see its five-year term because of all of the things that
*05:00.560- 05:06.000* :  are going to happen because of the differences that we have outlined.
*05:06.580- 05:12.860* :  Nomsomoseko. This G7 leaders meet for the second day in the Italian city of Bari.
*05:12.860- 05:17.660* :  The view is stunning. The Adriatic backdrop calm and serene.
*05:17.840- 05:22.140* :  A stark contrast, perhaps, to how many of the politicians attending might be feeling.
*05:22.560- 05:26.000* :  The summit comes as a number of leaders, including the British Prime Minister,
*05:26.000- 05:31.060* :  Rishi Sunak, the French President Emmanuel Macron, and the US President Joe Biden
*05:31.060- 05:37.340* :  faced electoral challenges back home. Today's agenda has been dominated by concerns surrounding
*05:37.340- 05:43.120* :  China and its manufacturing, but there are differences within the G7 over how to counter
*05:43.120- 05:48.380* :  Chinese state subsidies with Europe anxious to avoid an all-out trade war with Beijing.
*05:48.380- 05:53.580* :  On top of all of that, Pope Francis has also made an unusual intervention.
*05:53.580- 05:57.420* :  Our correspondent in Bari Mark Lohan told us more.
*05:57.860- 06:03.460* :  China very much dominating the discussions this morning between G7 leaders here in southern Italy
*06:03.460- 06:08.420* :  with concerns not only about Chinese excess production for the markets that are basically
*06:08.420- 06:15.540* :  stifling competition in other countries because of basically saturating the markets and allowing
*06:15.540- 06:22.040* :  trade subsidies to produce overproduction, but also Chinese banks and financial institutions
*06:22.040- 06:27.160* :  that are helping fund the Russian war effort and war machine in Ukraine.
*06:27.160- 06:32.440* :  So we are getting dribs and drabs of a final communique that are being leaked now to the news
*06:32.440- 06:40.360* :  agencies that are likely to call on China to stop the overproduction in trade,
*06:40.360- 06:44.580* :  but also to threaten China with sanctions and Chinese entities with sanctions.
*06:44.580- 06:50.280* :  If they help Russia produce more arms and helps stimulate the Russian defense industry,
*06:50.280- 06:54.680* :  but also if they help Russia circumvent sanctions on oil production as well.
*06:54.680- 07:00.720* :  So like these be tough lines coming out in the final communique later on today with regards
*07:00.720- 07:05.660* :  to China, there is also then a session this afternoon on a very different topic on artificial
*07:05.700- 07:11.440* :  intelligence attended by none other than Pope Francis who has now landed here in southern Italy.
*07:11.440- 07:16.700* :  He is the first Pope in the history of the G7 ever to attend this summit and he will be speaking
*07:16.700- 07:22.720* :  to G7 leaders about his concerns as well as the potentials and opportunities provided by artificial
*07:22.720- 07:26.680* :  intelligence. So let's talk about it a little bit more with Jess Rapson who is a senior researcher
*07:27.020- 07:31.220* :  with the G7 research group and focuses on AI. Thank you very much Jess for being with us.
*07:31.520- 07:36.840* :  What is the Pope likely to have in his message on AI to these G7 leaders?
*07:37.120- 07:42.380* :  To highly unusual move, it's likely that he is maybe not entirely motivated just by concerns
*07:42.380- 07:47.160* :  about AI safety as a lot of the other leaders have talked about but potentially maybe also some
*07:47.160- 07:52.020* :  theological concerns from the Catholic Church. The Pope has made statements on AI already at World
*07:52.020- 07:56.720* :  Communications Day a few months ago where he stated that humans should not get wisdom from machines
*07:56.720- 08:01.220* :  and he's also opposed the word intelligence being used in artificial intelligence and is
*08:01.260- 08:04.960* :  instead argued that machine learning should be used to describe artificial intelligence.
*08:05.800- 08:11.520* :  And he has been pushing for a more global finding regulation of AI. How likely and
*08:11.520- 08:17.060* :  possible is that? Yeah so the G7's been quite responsive to global concerns about AI safety so far.
*08:17.060- 08:22.600* :  So as you may know in 2023 the Hiroshima process was adopted in December so that's just an
*08:22.600- 08:27.480* :  international policy that kind of states a leader's stance is towards advanced AI models.
*08:28.280- 08:32.380* :  The language in that in that process which is adopted last year is not particularly binding so
*08:32.380- 08:38.080* :  there were no solid commitments to mobilising funds or enacting specific policies it just laid out
*08:38.080- 08:42.560* :  kind of general grounds for what leaders believe should be done. Jess Raphson from the G7 research group
*08:42.560- 08:46.520* :  thank you very much very good to have your thoughts and a sign of just important AI is that
*08:46.520- 08:50.800* :  you know it isn't the centre of this G7 but also that Pope Francis is attending this
*08:50.800- 08:55.540* :  this session on it. I have to say that he's had a slightly lighter morning because he was hosting
*08:55.940- 09:00.280* :  around a hundred comedians from around the world including Jimmy Fallon and Wuppie Goldberg
*09:00.280- 09:04.800* :  perhaps a slightly more witty audience there than he will get here at the G7.
*09:05.440- 09:11.880* :  Mark Lohan the leader of one of Canada's largest parties has said he is more convinced than ever
*09:11.880- 09:17.300* :  that some of his fellow parliamentarians have helped foreign states efforts to interfere
*09:17.760- 09:23.440* :  in Canadian politics. Jasmeet Singh the leader of the new democratic party made that statement
*09:23.440- 09:29.740* :  after reading the unredacted version of a bombshell report by Canada's National Security Committee
*09:30.140- 09:35.740* :  the report also says India and China are the main foreign threats to Canada's democratic
*09:35.740- 09:42.440* :  institutions Beijing has routinely denied accusations of interference. Ella Bicknell told me more.
*09:42.760- 09:48.140* :  Strong accusations indeed Alex very few people have been able to read the full version of this report
*09:48.140- 09:53.440* :  only major party leaders can request special security clearance to read the unredacted version
*09:53.900- 09:58.740* :  so Jagmeet Singh he's the leader of the new democratic party the fourth biggest party in parliament
*09:58.740- 10:03.500* :  and he was given that access and he's seen the names of those MPs who as the report says
*10:04.120- 10:09.640* :  wittingly or unwittingly helped foreign bodies in their attempts to interfere with Canadian politics
*10:09.660- 10:15.120* :  so speaking at a news conference on Thursday he said the report is even more alarming than he
*10:15.120- 10:20.240* :  previously thought he went as far to say that some Canadian politicians showed criminal behaviour
*10:20.240- 10:24.000* :  even treason and offending lawmakers should be removed from office.
*10:24.560- 10:28.920* :  There are a number of MPs who have knowingly provided help to foreign governments
*10:29.820- 10:36.200* :  some to the detriment of Canada and Canadians. There are also politicians at all levels of
*10:36.200- 10:42.540* :  government who have benefited from foreign interference. Some of this behaviour absolutely appears
*10:42.540- 10:48.260* :  to be criminal and should be prosecuted. He's directly called out Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
*10:48.260- 10:53.620* :  and the leader of the opposition PR-20F accusing them of not doing enough about foreign interference
*10:53.620- 10:58.700* :  in Canadian politics. And those are strong words Alex Mr Trudeau has been battling accusations
*10:58.700- 11:03.400* :  for some time now that he's soft on security and Mr Singh's words won't help in there.
*11:03.640- 11:10.140* :  Arabic No. The UN's health agency says a significant proportion of Gaza's population is facing
*11:10.140- 11:15.760* :  catastrophic hunger and famine like conditions after eight months of war. Thousands of children have
*11:15.760- 11:21.920* :  been diagnosed with acute malnutrition. James Elder is a spokesperson for the UN's children's
*11:21.920- 11:27.380* :  agency UNICEF. He has spent recent days trying to move around Gaza to understand the situation
*11:27.380- 11:32.580* :  there for children compared to when he was last six weeks ago. It's the first time I've seen
*11:32.580- 11:38.640* :  a real level of despondency. They know that they're only alive through luck. It's very unsettling
*11:38.640- 11:43.640* :  to see a child when that child realises their parent can't protect them. It's heartbreaking when
*11:43.640- 11:47.740* :  a parent realises they can't protect their child. So increasingly I'm hearing people say,
*11:47.740- 11:52.420* :  I just want this over. I'm happy if there's an air strike on me tonight. That's a level of
*11:52.420- 11:57.180* :  desperation. It's hard to understand, but that's what comes when family members have been killed.
*11:57.180- 12:01.440* :  Your home has been bombed. You're living in a tent. It's 40 degrees. The last two nights,
*12:01.440- 12:05.960* :  at least here for me have been utterly sleepless two nights ago. It was heavy, heavy bombardment
*12:05.960- 12:11.740* :  last night. It was just drones like a lawnmower in your head, this psychological torture if you will.
*12:12.200- 12:17.300* :  And that's 250 days for people. So of course, as long as this horror show goes on,
*12:17.300- 12:23.620* :  it gets worse and worse for children and families. On Sunday, it will be the Muslim festival of
*12:23.620- 12:29.120* :  Eid al-Adha. International journalists continue to be barred from Gaza by Israel and Egypt,
*12:29.120- 12:35.200* :  but our correspondent, Yoland Nell, in Jerusalem gave us this update. We can see at the moment,
*12:35.200- 12:40.760* :  just the situation, the humanitarian situation. It hasn't been focused on so much in recent days,
*12:40.760- 12:45.000* :  because a lot of the focus has been on the diplomatic efforts to get a new cease-fire
*12:45.000- 12:50.120* :  and hostage release deal. But we've had this week, this independent group of experts advising
*12:50.120- 12:54.600* :  you and agencies that it says it's possible families underway already in northern Gaza.
*12:55.120- 12:59.940* :  And that because we still have such fierce ongoing fighting, these restrictions on humanitarian
*12:59.940- 13:06.200* :  access, that is impeding even the data collection to prove it. But we've had growing concerns
*13:06.200- 13:11.280* :  about the deadly hunger and there had been these warnings before that full-blown famine
*13:11.280- 13:16.040* :  should be expected, particularly in the north of the Gaza Strip, even though there have been
*13:16.040- 13:21.700* :  renewed efforts to open up other crossings to get more AIDS, especially food and clean water in
*13:21.740- 13:25.520* :  there. I mean, it's just a reminder of how now going into the Eid al-Adha holiday,
*13:25.520- 13:29.720* :  that's the time Muslims all around the world will be kind of, you know, going shopping for new
*13:29.720- 13:34.820* :  clothes, getting ready to feast with their families. I mean, displaced gardens, they're unable
*13:34.820- 13:39.800* :  to celebrate, they have no money and no food, and it's just a really desperate situation.
*13:39.800- 13:44.200* :  You have this widespread destruction in Gaza. I have been speaking to people there in recent days,
*13:44.200- 13:48.600* :  we just talk about, you know, that the awful daily living conditions that they are enduring,
*13:48.600- 13:54.280* :  there are no hospitals to go to in the main, and it's just a really, really difficult time.
*13:54.780- 14:02.540* :  You land now. Now, how can an oil tanker escape police custody? You'd think, given the size of
*14:02.540- 14:07.140* :  such a ship, it would be impossible. However, the authorities in Thailand say they're searching
*14:07.140- 14:12.220* :  for three tankers that have gone missing off its eastern coast. Vessels are now believed to be
*14:12.220- 14:16.880* :  traveling towards Cambodia. Asia-Pacificated to Celia Hatton told me more.
*14:17.400- 14:23.960* :  That's right. They were part of a group of five vessels that were seized by Thai police
*14:24.140- 14:30.140* :  back in March. They were anchored, as you say, on a police dock in the city of Satahib.
*14:30.520- 14:38.500* :  They're very valuable these tankers because they're carrying 330,000 liters of smuggled oil.
*14:39.400- 14:45.900* :  Now, they disappeared this week after a storm was going to be hitting the eastern coast of Thailand,
*14:45.900- 14:52.360* :  and so the skippers of the ship suggested to the police that the ships be moved a little bit out
*14:52.360- 14:57.860* :  to sea, about 100 meters away from the docks where they were being held, because the docks themselves
*14:57.860- 15:03.920* :  are really old and rickety. The skipper said they were worried that the ships would damage the docks
*15:03.920- 15:11.500* :  in the storm. However, when police woke up the next morning, three of the ships were gone, and so
*15:11.500- 15:16.680* :  there are a lot of questions being asked now. Where could they be? Well, it looks like it was a
*15:16.680- 15:24.260* :  planned escape. Now, looking back at security footage, Thai authorities realize that the crews of
*15:24.260- 15:31.740* :  these ships had been loading items onto the ships, and also their tracking systems had been disabled.
*15:31.740- 15:37.020* :  And so it's now thought that the ships are slowly traveling. These oil tankers are slowly
*15:37.020- 15:43.180* :  traveling along the Thai coast to evade detection, because so many boats are traveling along there.
*15:43.180- 15:48.000* :  It's quite difficult to spot them, it's thought. But because they're so heavy, it's thought they're
*15:48.000- 15:53.820* :  traveling very, very slowly. And so the authorities say they think that the tankers are still in
*15:53.820- 15:59.420* :  Thai waters. They haven't reached Cambodia yet, it's believed. This is embarrassing. Is this being
*15:59.420- 16:05.020* :  seen as a bungalow by the police only? Oh, certainly. And there are several police who are under
*16:05.860- 16:10.940* :  investigation who've been moved to other duties and are being questioned. It is quite embarrassing,
*16:10.940- 16:17.260* :  because oil smuggling is an ongoing problem for Thailand. It's thought that that huge smuggling
*16:17.260- 16:22.040* :  networks have been set up to get oil from Middle Eastern countries, many of which are facing
*16:22.040- 16:28.600* :  sanctions in the West. There are smuggling cut rate oil in and selling it around Southeast Asia.
*16:28.820- 16:32.620* :  And so the police have been saying for some time that they want to crack down on this,
*16:32.800- 16:36.740* :  but this is really embarrassing that three huge oil tankers have gone missing.
*16:40.400- 16:46.740* :  Still to come in this podcast. If anything can bring Germany, the people here back together
*16:46.740- 16:52.120* :  it is football. The nation's last big can fire, where people can feel at home irrespective
*16:52.120- 16:57.180* :  of their political or religious differences. As the euro football tournament kicks off, we look
*16:57.440- 17:11.460* :  at Germany's aspirations. Welcome to the Bright Side, a new kind of daily podcast from Hello Sunshine,
*17:11.460- 17:17.760* :  hosted by me, Danielle Robe, and me, Simone Boyce. Every weekday we're bringing you conversations
*17:17.760- 17:24.020* :  about culture, the latest trends, inspiration, and so much more. We'll hear from celebrities,
*17:24.020- 17:30.500* :  authors, experts, and listeners like you. Bring a little optimism into your life with the Bright Side.
*17:30.980- 17:36.200* :  Listen to the Bright Side from Hello Sunshine on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts.
*17:41.780- 17:48.180* :  29-year-old Jasper Machogo is a Kenyan farmer, but on social media he's become famous for denying
*17:48.180- 17:53.860* :  the existence of climate change. To his thousands of followers he presents himself as a campaigner,
*17:53.980- 18:00.320* :  a flag bearer for fossil fuels of which he says Africa has plenty. And he certainly appears to
*18:00.320- 18:06.320* :  struck a chord with some in the West who, like him, reject the overwhelming scientific consensus
*18:06.540- 18:14.020* :  on climate change. But is there more to his activism than meets the eye? BBC Verifies Marco Silver has
*18:14.020- 18:20.200* :  been investigating. Today, my mum's harvesting the finger millet that she planted a couple of
*18:20.280- 18:27.220* :  months ago. At a glance, you might think Jasper Machogo is just a farmer with a knack for social media.
*18:27.600- 18:35.140* :  On X, formerly Twitter, he regularly posts videos like this one, offering a window into rural life
*18:35.140- 18:41.500* :  in Kisee, southwest Kenya. So let me show you how we do it over here. But take a closer look at Mr.
*18:41.500- 18:47.700* :  Machogo's posts and you'll see it's not farming that he mostly wants to talk about, but rather
*18:47.700- 18:53.440* :  he's denial of climate change. You're telling us that we should care about climate change. What does
*18:53.440- 18:59.440* :  climate change anyone? Jasper Machogo has repeatedly claimed wrongly that climate change isn't real
*18:59.440- 19:05.480* :  or manmade, but rather a plot by the West to keep Africa poor. Saying that climate is a hoax is
*19:05.480- 19:13.420* :  just really not true. Dr. Joyce Kimutai is a climate scientist from Kenya. It's been many years
*19:13.420- 19:22.660* :  of scientists working and there's a strong consensus on climate change, human activities and
*19:22.660- 19:30.160* :  especially burning of fossil fuels as actually increased global service temperatures.
*19:30.840- 19:36.520* :  While Africa has some of the lowest emissions on the planet, it is also one of the places most
*19:36.520- 19:42.900* :  vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Be it more frequent heat waves or devastating floods.
*19:42.900- 19:48.080* :  I wanted to understand how Jasper Machogo came to hold his views on climate change,
*19:48.080- 19:55.220* :  so I approached him for an interview. He was upbeat about his newfound popularity. So I've seen
*19:55.220- 20:01.180* :  my African Twitter following grow, which is a good thing. Mr. Machogo says it's all down to
*20:01.180- 20:07.480* :  a campaign he's been running on social media, fossil fuels for Africa. And it argues Africa should
*20:07.480- 20:15.240* :  tap into its vast reserves of coal, oil and gas to grow. I think Africans are really
*20:15.240- 20:20.340* :  embracing the fact that I'm saying fossil fuels for Africa. They like that. But is that really the
*20:20.340- 20:27.320* :  case? By analyzing conversations on X involving Mr. Machogo's handle, I found that most users
*20:28.160- 20:34.840* :  engaging with him online are actually in the US, the UK and Canada. And they're not just interacting
*20:34.840- 20:40.320* :  with him, they're also sending him money. Through saying whatever I say, I've got people reaching
*20:40.320- 20:46.140* :  out to me saying, oh Jasper, how can I help you? In the last two years, Mr. Machogo has raised more
*20:46.140- 20:53.040* :  than $9,000 US dollars through online fund raising pages. Among his donors were individuals
*20:53.040- 20:59.780* :  with links to the fossil fuel industry and also to think tanks known for promoting climate change
*20:59.780- 21:07.220* :  denial. But Mr. Machogo rejects suggestions that these donations have had any impact on his views
*21:07.220- 21:13.320* :  on climate change, which he insists are genuinely held. Nobody has told me to change my views.
*21:13.900- 21:19.100* :  I'm saying what I'm saying. And if somebody decides to pay me for doing that, I don't mind at all.
*21:19.940- 21:25.420* :  Jasper, Machogo, ending that report from Marco Silva. And if you'd like to find out more about
*21:25.420- 21:31.560* :  this investigation, you can hear the full story on BBC Trending this weekend on the World Service.
*21:31.560- 21:38.960* :  Listen online, just search for BBC Trending. Scotland take on the host's Germany in the first
*21:38.960- 21:45.680* :  game of the Euro 2024 football tournament later today. But the build up to the tournament has failed
*21:45.680- 21:51.040* :  to inspire the German public with expectations low that the team will do well and many people
*21:51.040- 21:55.920* :  are apparently more concerned with problems like the cost of living. But the national team has
*21:55.920- 22:00.040* :  been bouncing back under a new coach and there's renewed hope that through the tournament,
*22:00.040- 22:04.800* :  the country can recapture the spirit of golden summers of the past.
*22:05.200- 22:08.400* :  You're a correspondent Nick Beak reports from Munich.
*22:18.980- 22:24.360* :  In Munich's historic centre, a rendition of the German national anthem, Scotland style.
*22:24.760- 22:29.240* :  The visiting Scottish fans have brought noise and energy to a host nation
*22:29.740- 22:34.880* :  that until now hasn't seemed hugely excited about laying on this footballing festival.
*22:37.020- 22:38.280* :  But there are some exceptions.
*22:41.800- 22:48.120* :  With no doubting the passion they have for football here, this is ESV Freiman, a club in the
*22:48.120- 22:54.160* :  north of Munich and all around us, dozens and dozens of kids are playing on lots of different
*22:54.160- 22:59.700* :  pitches. Just in front of us the game underway here, they're only about four or five years old,
*23:00.260- 23:07.200* :  having a well of a time. So has the prospect of hosting the Euro's captured the imagination here?
*23:07.720- 23:15.760* :  It brings people together because of something we share as a community and yes many people like
*23:15.760- 23:21.300* :  football. If Germans win the tournament, more people might play and I think that's a good thing.
*23:22.200- 23:27.720* :  Older German fans though seem less enthusiastic. Why? Well it's been eight years without getting
*23:27.720- 23:32.940* :  to the knockout stages of a major men's tournament, the high price of tickets this summer,
*23:33.460- 23:39.540* :  and also a wider national malaise, some feel. Fractious, fragmented coalition government
*23:39.540- 23:46.180* :  and sluggish economic growth. Of course what the country really needs is another summer merciless.
*23:54.100- 24:00.140* :  Summer fairy tale was the label lovingly attached to the 2006 World Cup that Germany hosted.
*24:00.760- 24:06.160* :  The home team was knocked out in the semi-finals, but not before capturing the public imagination.
*24:06.760- 24:12.360* :  This in turn showcased to the world a united, colorful and more confident country.
*24:18.780- 24:24.820* :  Everybody hopes for another summer fairy tale with a happy mood of 2006 returning in 2024,
*24:24.860- 24:30.960* :  but I am skeptical. Philip Koster is a leading football journalist. It's a different situation.
*24:30.960- 24:36.540* :  We've got the war in Ukraine, we just went through the pandemic, society is torn, people don't
*24:36.540- 24:44.880* :  know which direction they should take. Keeping Euro 2024 safe is an international effort.
*24:45.500- 24:49.940* :  Police forces from around Europe have already stopped known hooligans in their own countries
*24:50.380- 24:54.120* :  from travelling to Germany. At police headquarters in the centre of Munich,
*24:54.120- 24:59.720* :  we meet Deputy Commissioner Michał Dubowski, who will be directing operations around the six
*24:59.720- 25:04.900* :  matches the city will host over the next month. During the last weeks we had some postings in the
*25:05.380- 25:10.380* :  social media from the IS during the Champions League, for example, and during the Bundesliga.
*25:10.800- 25:15.080* :  We checked this posting, but we don't expect that there's a concrete danger,
*25:15.800- 25:20.420* :  but it's possible that somebody could be motivated from this posting.
*25:24.220- 25:30.720* :  The arrival of foreign fans has packed the beer gardens and jolted Euro 2024 into life.
*25:30.720- 25:35.840* :  It's worth remembering that even in the run-up to Germany's golden summer of 2006,
*25:35.840- 25:42.220* :  there wasn't much obvious public enthusiasm. And football writer Philip Koster says you should never
*25:42.220- 25:50.940* :  underestimate the potential potency of this game. If anything can bring Germany, the people
*25:50.940- 25:56.480* :  here back together, it is football. The nation's last big campfire, where people can feel at home
*25:56.480- 26:01.800* :  irrespective of their political or religious differences. Football journalist Philip Koster
*26:01.800- 26:05.600* :  ending that report by Nick Beag. Now have a listen to this.
*26:10.280- 26:17.120* :  That's Columbus by the Japanese pop group Mrs Green Apple. I catch you tune. But the music video
*26:17.120- 26:21.980* :  has got the group into trouble. I heard more from our Tokyo correspondent Shima Khalil.
*26:22.280- 26:27.140* :  In the video, it shows the three members of the Mrs Green Apple, a very famous
*26:27.140- 26:32.440* :  J-pop group dressed as historical figures, and one of them actually dressed as Christopher Columbus.
*26:32.920- 26:39.040* :  And they appear to be on this tropical island. And then they encounter what looks like primitive
*26:39.040- 26:45.360* :  creatures depicted as apes on this island. They also appear to be native to this island. It's
*26:45.360- 26:50.220* :  presumed to be these creatures. And in one scene of the video, an ape is pulling on one of the
*26:50.220- 26:55.180* :  band members, Rick Shaw, and others learning how to play a musical instrument, generally depicting
*26:55.180- 27:01.720* :  them as servile, as primitive. Now the video was released on Wednesday, and almost immediately
*27:01.720- 27:07.980* :  the backlash started. Alex from fans describing it as racist, discriminatory, but also some saying
*27:07.980- 27:14.660* :  that it actually just reflected the stupidity of the makers of the video. And many asking why on
*27:14.660- 27:19.300* :  earth this was allowed to happen, where were the checks, and who allowed this to happen,
*27:19.300- 27:26.440* :  who allowed this to be released, and why the big problems and how racist this video is wasn't caught
*27:26.440- 27:31.900* :  earlier. And serious fallout. Of course, serious fallout, and you could see by the bands apology,
*27:31.900- 27:36.440* :  they came, of course, and they apologized on the fan page. Their vocalist Motoki Omori,
*27:36.440- 27:41.060* :  who was behind the concept of the video, said that the group lacked consideration of how it would
*27:41.060- 27:46.560* :  be interpreted failed to come up with other ideas. The record company, Universal Music, pulled it
*27:46.560- 27:52.360* :  from public view, and said it lacked understanding of cultural context, but also Coca-Cola, Japan,
*27:52.360- 27:58.980* :  that used this song that we just heard on their ads. They stopped it, said they had no room for
*27:58.980- 28:04.600* :  discrimination. And also the appearances in some broadcasters have been pulled, they've been dropped
*28:05.180- 28:12.180* :  so the consequences keep coming. Now, would you be up for airing your
*28:12.180- 28:18.740* :  dirty laundry in public? Quite literally. According to a new study in Sweden, the answer is no.
*28:19.080- 28:22.860* :  It appears that our feelings of disgust and shame about having smelly clothing
*28:23.600- 28:29.560* :  is encouraging excessive laundering even among those who care about the environment as Rebecca
*28:34.380- 28:38.800* :  Wood reports. The sound of a washing machine. How often is this the sound track to your daily
*28:38.800- 28:45.220* :  routine? Experts would say most likely more than ever before. People are wearing each garment
*28:45.220- 28:50.200* :  fewer times before throwing it in the laundry basket. It's also easier and cheaper to access
*28:50.200- 28:56.660* :  washing machines. But this could have a big environmental impact, detergent entering our water
*28:56.660- 29:02.200* :  supplies and the energy involved. A new study from Charmer's University of Technology in Sweden
*29:02.200- 29:07.400* :  has taken a look at whether there are also psychological reasons behind our laundering behaviors.
*29:07.960- 29:14.020* :  Eric Clint is lead author of the study. Even though you have a high environmental identity,
*29:14.020- 29:21.960* :  the social pressure or the need for us to fit in will decide how we act. And especially for
*29:22.020- 29:26.900* :  laundering, because laundering is not necessarily something that people think about as an
*29:26.900- 29:32.620* :  environmental issue. The survey of 2,000 people in Sweden revealed that even though most of us today
*29:32.620- 29:38.020* :  would lean towards environmentally friendly life choices, it appears that when it comes to laundry,
*29:38.020- 29:44.880* :  the pressure from society not to smell or appear dirty overrides that. I think just for laundering
*29:44.880- 29:52.400* :  paranoia is separated that people don't tell you directly if you smell. So you act that
*29:52.540- 29:58.780* :  better safe than sorry. But that fear may be misplaced. Eric's team concluded that apart from strong
*29:58.780- 30:04.900* :  body odor or large stains near your face, most of us are unaware of other people's cleanliness
*30:04.900- 30:10.480* :  but highly aware of our own. So is there anything we can do to change our habits?
*30:11.160- 30:18.080* :  Many people unconsciously hooking things in the longer bin just out of habit. So what we're trying
*30:18.080- 30:24.640* :  to pinpoint here is that make people more conscious about their decision in the long room.
*30:25.120- 30:30.760* :  So if you want to make a change, what's the best way to go about it? Well, there are no hard rules
*30:30.760- 30:36.520* :  about how often clothes should be washed, but clothing manufacturers generally recommend doing it
*30:36.520- 30:42.340* :  less frequently, even if just to make the clothes last a bit longer. Some items suit that better
*30:42.340- 30:47.940* :  than others, walled jumpers and denim jeans definitely don't require frequent washes. But wearing
*30:47.940- 30:53.080* :  the same pair of underpants for a week is probably not going to go down too well with colleagues.
*30:53.080- 30:58.940* :  Although this does happen, does Eric have any expert advice on how to break it to a colleague
*30:58.940- 31:00.120* :  that they may smell?
*31:05.060- 31:05.660* :  Rebecca Wood.
*31:08.840- 31:14.300* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
