*00:46.260- 00:50.280* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless
*00:50.280- 00:54.040* :  companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:54.460- 00:57.060* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.340- 01:02.300* :  contracts, they said, what the **** are you talking about? You insane Hollywood ****?
*01:02.700- 01:08.020* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:21.780- 01:24.760* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:24.760- 01:30.860* :  the 6th of June, these are our main stories. Reports are emerging ever massacre in central Sudan
*01:30.860- 01:36.660* :  allegedly carried out by the paramilitary rapid support forces. The head of the United Nations
*01:36.660- 01:41.580* :  Antonio Guterres calls for a global ban on fossil fuel advertising.
*01:44.360- 01:50.480* :  Also in this podcast, how in the face of Western sanctions Russia is looking east to strengthen
*01:50.480- 01:56.760* :  its economic partnerships. And would you take advice from your future self? We'll hear from
*01:56.760- 02:01.100* :  the researcher who thinks you might. What we're trying to do is to create technology.
*02:01.100- 02:06.460* :  So you can ask different kind of question, like if you take these live-shows, what would happen?
*02:06.460- 02:09.320* :  Or if you take, you know, a different live-shows, what would happen?
*02:14.060- 02:19.920* :  We start in Sudan where the rapid support forces have been accused of a massacre on Tuesday
*02:19.920- 02:26.240* :  in a village in Gazeera State south of the capital Khartoum. Footage on social media shows people
*02:26.240- 02:32.260* :  standing in front of dozens of bodies covered in shrouds. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese
*02:32.260- 02:39.280* :  army since the civil war launched by rival generals began in April 2023. Mahanat Hashim has
*02:39.280- 02:44.860* :  been monitoring developments. What we know is that the RSF surrounded the village and was asking
*02:44.860- 02:51.260* :  the villagers to hand over their properties and money and so forth. Then subsequently,
*02:51.260- 02:57.940* :  the villagers raised the alarm. The army tried to carry an air raid against RSF positions around
*02:57.940- 03:04.140* :  the village. They dispersed following that air raid, the RSF returned again to the village and
*03:04.140- 03:10.920* :  attacked it twice. The initial reports were putting the death toll at around 80. Now it is confirmed
*03:10.920- 03:17.800* :  that the death toll is upwards of 150. And just before coming on air, the governor of Darfur
*03:17.800- 03:25.980* :  Miniminawi has tweeted a video to that effect and apparently the Sudanese sovereign council,
*03:25.980- 03:30.480* :  which is controlled by the Sudanese army, the de facto sort of like head of state, as it were,
*03:30.980- 03:36.640* :  are calling for the international community to put pressure and to condemn this latest
*03:36.640- 03:40.780* :  atrocity committed by the RSF. And the international community responding?
*03:41.340- 03:45.420* :  So far we haven't seen anything. I mean, you have to keep in mind that this is news just breaking
*03:45.420- 03:51.340* :  out. We'll have to wait and see what actually happens. It's also not quite clear what are the
*03:51.340- 03:58.320* :  circumstances that led the RSF to targeting the residents of this particular village and killing
*03:58.320- 04:03.660* :  such large number. There is a feeling going around the Sudanese commentators that have spoken
*04:03.660- 04:10.300* :  to that this might be perhaps one of the worst one-day massacres or atrocities that happened
*04:10.300- 04:13.320* :  in this war that's now in, is in its second year.
*04:13.600- 04:17.980* :  But involvement from the international community has been pretty sparse so far, hasn't it?
*04:18.360- 04:23.440* :  I mean, it's been one of those things where the international community has tried to bring
*04:23.440- 04:28.180* :  the rapid support forces and the army to talks. And when we say the international community,
*04:28.180- 04:32.860* :  we speak about the United States and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates has long been accused
*04:32.860- 04:38.600* :  of backing the rapid support forces, arming them and funding them. And more recently, the Sudanese
*04:38.600- 04:44.060* :  have, the Sudanese army has turned towards Iran and Russia to find backing.
*04:44.460- 04:51.100* :  Mahanat Hashim. Fossil fuel industries have been described by the Secretary-General of the United
*04:51.100- 04:56.600* :  Nations, Antonio Guterres, as the godfathers of climate chaos, who have distorted the truth
*04:56.980- 05:02.040* :  and deceived the public for decades. In a speech in New York to mark world environment,
*05:02.040- 05:07.840* :  Mr. Guterres condemned the industries responsible for the bulk of global warming by making huge
*05:07.840- 05:13.520* :  profits as the planet burned. He said they were doing virtually nothing to combat climate change.
*05:14.120- 05:19.920* :  I call on leaders in the fossil fuel industry to understand that if you are not in the first lane
*05:19.920- 05:27.200* :  to clean energy transformation, you are driving your business into a devent and taking us all with you.
*05:28.700- 05:36.180* :  Last year, the oil and gas industry invested a measly 2.5 percent of its total capital spending on
*05:36.180- 05:43.360* :  clean energy. Doubling down on fossil fuels in the 21st century is like doubling down on
*05:43.360- 05:50.280* :  earth's shoes and carriage wheels in the 9 teams. Mr. Guterres also urged world leaders to act
*05:50.280- 05:56.220* :  within 18 months if they want to salvage humanity's chances of a livable future and environment
*05:56.220- 06:02.880* :  correspondent Matt McGraw told us more about the speech. Mr. Guterres was calling for a global
*06:02.880- 06:08.180* :  ban on advertising from fossil fuel companies. He wants governments around the world to treat
*06:08.180- 06:13.360* :  fossil fuels like they did tobacco in the past and to essentially ban advertising and he called on
*06:13.360- 06:18.540* :  news companies and technology companies not to take advertising from fossil fuel companies and
*06:18.540- 06:22.880* :  he called on the creative industries to move away from those as well. So I think there are some of
*06:22.880- 06:27.740* :  the strongest statements Mr. Guterres has made yet on this particular issue and he's zoned in on
*06:27.740- 06:32.460* :  this fossil fuel aspect and the fossil fuel companies and I think there's a lot of environmentalists
*06:32.580- 06:37.020* :  and indeed some scientists out there who will probably sympathise with this particular call.
*06:37.180- 06:43.120* :  And this of course on the same day as EU climate scientists warn of there being just five years
*06:43.640- 06:50.980* :  left in their view to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius which is regarded as the
*06:50.980- 06:56.680* :  the number at which normal life can continue essentially. Yeah the 1.5 threshold was
*06:56.680- 07:01.280* :  agreed in the Paris Agreement in 2015 and scientific reports since then have shown that there's
*07:01.280- 07:05.520* :  a massive difference to the world in staying below it or going above it in terms of what we lose
*07:05.540- 07:10.160* :  in terms of the Arctic in terms of corals in terms of the whole world that we know and love.
*07:10.600- 07:14.400* :  Now the problem of course is that our emissions have continued in their time and our efforts to
*07:14.440- 07:20.840* :  cut them have failed pretty much over the last nine years or so and so the research now shows that
*07:20.840- 07:27.000* :  basically if we have about five years worth of emissions left before we go past that threshold
*07:27.000- 07:31.460* :  and other reports today pointed out that there's essentially any one of the next five years there's
*07:31.460- 07:37.620* :  an 80% chance of going over that particular threshold as well so that's looking very vulnerable
*07:37.660- 07:41.420* :  and I think scientists would acknowledge that realistically speaking we're going to go past it.
*07:41.760- 07:46.500* :  What happens then nobody knows but scientists would say look every degree every fraction of a
*07:46.500- 07:50.660* :  degree really matters here and can make a big difference and they're calling for a doubling down
*07:50.660- 07:55.580* :  in efforts to limit those emissions. Antonio Guterres the head of the earn is talking about it we've got
*07:55.580- 08:02.780* :  the used top scientists making these warnings but I've been interviewing you on the BBC World Service
*08:02.780- 08:11.400* :  about impending warnings of doom from climate change for years and the reality is humanity hasn't
*08:11.400- 08:16.740* :  changed direction whatever Mr Guterres or anyone else says humanity is not going to change is it.
*08:16.860- 08:20.860* :  I appreciate where you're coming from on that Alex and I understand your perspective but I would
*08:20.860- 08:25.380* :  say that it's not quite as like that I think the world has made huge strides in terms of moving
*08:25.380- 08:30.900* :  away from fossil fuels we're doing this at rapid pace countries like the UK for instance have
*08:31.260- 08:36.500* :  essentially caught their emissions by half since 1990 and still grown their economies renewables
*08:36.500- 08:40.360* :  are on a massive upward surge all over the world that the cheapest forms of electricity
*08:40.720- 08:45.520* :  countries have got plans in place they will bring down emissions just not quickly enough to
*08:45.520- 08:52.260* :  save off the science that's the real challenge. Matt McGraw. The Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fizzo
*08:52.260- 08:57.100* :  has appeared on screen for the first time since an attempt on his life on May the 15th
*08:57.380- 09:03.140* :  speaking in a video posted on his Facebook page Mr Fizzo forgave the attacker but described him
*09:03.460- 09:09.620* :  as an activist for Slovakia's opposition he warned the media the liberal opposition and foreign
*09:09.620- 09:15.220* :  funded non-governmental organizations not to try to downplay the political motive for the attack
*09:15.220- 09:21.920* :  Robert Cameron reports. Three weeks after Robert Fizzo was gunned down in central Slovakia he's
*09:21.920- 09:27.280* :  made a vigorous return to political life on the eve of the European Parliament elections
*09:27.340- 09:33.700* :  speaking from his home in Bratislava in a crisp white and blue patterned shirt and apparently
*09:33.700- 09:39.520* :  recovering well from treatment for four bullet wounds he began on a conciliatory note.
*09:42.700- 09:48.920* :  It's time to take the first step which is forgiveness. I feel no hatred towards the
*09:48.920- 09:56.920* :  stranger who shot me I will not take any active legal action against him nor seek damage compensation
*09:58.040- 10:04.020* :  I forgive him and will let him sort out what he did and why he did it in his own head
*10:04.840- 10:11.280* :  but Mr Fizzo soon went on the attack describing him as a messenger of the evil and political hatred
*10:11.280- 10:18.600* :  whipped up by Slovakia's unsuccessful and frustrated liberal opposition and there was a shot
*10:18.600- 10:24.840* :  across the boughs aimed at western partners too. Mr Fizzo said Slovakia's opposition was merely
*10:24.840- 10:30.940* :  exploiting the fact that big countries were forcing through a single acceptable foreign policy
*10:31.340- 10:37.460* :  on issues such as Ukraine and riding roughshod over smaller nations that tried to embark
*10:37.460- 10:43.800* :  on a sovereign path. In Slovak politics he said this meant that violent or hateful excesses
*10:44.240- 10:49.680* :  against a democratically elected government were being tolerated on an international level.
*10:52.220- 10:56.860* :  What advice would you give your younger self? It's a question often asked of people
*10:56.860- 11:02.780* :  of a certain age or perhaps those coming to the end of their careers and hindsight is a
*11:02.780- 11:08.620* :  wonderful thing but what if you were able to get advice from your older self when you were
*11:08.620- 11:13.980* :  starting out? That's what researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT
*11:14.640- 11:21.600* :  have endeavoured to do in building an AI-powered chatbot designed to do just that. Pat Patara
*11:21.600- 11:29.040* :  Netaporn works on the future U project at MIT's Media Lab. James Menendez asked him how the chatbot
*11:29.040- 11:34.460* :  works. This project what we're trying to do is to create technology that can help people flourish
*11:34.460- 11:39.560* :  by supporting them in thinking in long term and encouraging them to reflect and think about
*11:39.560- 11:45.300* :  their future self. So you can ask different kind of question and use that as a way to experiment.
*11:45.300- 11:49.840* :  Like if you take these live-shows what would happen or if you take you know a different live-shows
*11:50.100- 11:54.760* :  what would happen and you know we tell people that this is not a prophecy it's just a mirror that
*11:54.760- 12:00.360* :  helped them sort of see one possible path. And am I right in saying that the user helps program
*12:00.360- 12:05.000* :  the chatbot if you like. In other words you have to give it some sort of guidance about your
*12:05.000- 12:11.100* :  aspirations. Is that right? Totally. So the user or the people using it you know you know create
*12:11.100- 12:16.240* :  a representation of their future self and that is a way for them to experiment with you know
*12:16.240- 12:20.780* :  different life decisions and you know we try to make that connection between the current self
*12:20.780- 12:25.820* :  and future self more clearly you know research have shown that if you can vividly see your future
*12:25.820- 12:31.460* :  self you tend to have better decision in terms of investment help decision and things like that.
*12:31.460- 12:38.360* :  So we try to strengthen that future self continuity. You're you're horribly young I think. How
*12:38.360- 12:44.580* :  did it work for you? I think you're 27 is that right? Yes well I am living in the US right now
*12:44.580- 12:50.520* :  and what is really fascinating to me is that my future self sort of encouraged me to think in
*12:50.520- 12:54.980* :  long term that you know in the future my parent may not be around with me so I should
*12:54.980- 12:59.940* :  cherish the time that I'm with my parent. So that's something that you know require a perspective.
*12:59.940- 13:06.220* :  I mean maybe it's a little obvious but for I guess Gen C like me that's something that we
*13:06.220- 13:10.160* :  can learn from our older self. Yeah so I don't think it's obvious at all now and I think it's
*13:10.160- 13:14.080* :  certainly something you learn you know throughout your life. What about sort of career decisions?
*13:14.240- 13:17.860* :  Can it help with those sort of things because we all make mistakes with that don't we?
*13:18.720- 13:23.480* :  Totally so one of the application is that you can sort of experiment like you know if you
*13:23.480- 13:28.340* :  you work for BBC versus you know you come to the US and work at MIT or you know become an astronaut
*13:28.340- 13:33.700* :  or different life decision we could potentially simulate you in different having different
*13:33.700- 13:40.500* :  career choices and you know again it's about retrospection and reflection you know the future self
*13:40.500- 13:45.440* :  is not going to make your life better it's you to you know to need to be able to do that today
*13:45.440- 13:50.280* :  and using this tool to sort of help you you know motivate you and and guide you through that.
*13:50.560- 13:56.060* :  Might it just tell you to not worry too much about the future? Yeah well I think you need to have
*13:56.060- 14:00.880* :  what we call critical optimism so be critical but also optimistic at the same time.
*14:01.680- 14:07.300* :  David Ellis is professor of behavioral science at the University of Bath here in England.
*14:07.300- 14:13.140* :  What does he make of the future you concept? It's a really interesting idea I mean it just
*14:13.140- 14:17.780* :  fall into that category of trying to make people think about the future consequences of their
*14:17.780- 14:23.700* :  actions today and I mean we already have that in very kind of a describe it as analog forms right
*14:23.700- 14:28.600* :  so you can have cigarettes and you have pictures of what happens to your lungs after 60 years
*14:28.600- 14:33.120* :  of smoking and that's it's a type of behavioral nudge or a type of reminder that well just because
*14:33.120- 14:36.780* :  it's okay today doesn't mean it will be okay in the future and this is almost like a sort of
*14:36.780- 14:41.440* :  digitized version of that the conversations can only be as accurate as the information that the
*14:41.440- 14:46.000* :  modules are provided with and that means that they're never going to be a hundred percent
*14:46.000- 14:50.960* :  accurate and I think the bigger question is also just the impact that might have on people's
*14:51.060- 14:55.100* :  behavior so looking at the works been that's been done you know people came away feeling that
*14:55.100- 14:59.620* :  they enjoyed the experience but of course the real proof is whether it did actually change
*14:59.620- 15:05.120* :  behavior and that's that's a much longer study to to do. Professor David Ellis.
*15:06.320- 15:11.860* :  Despite feeling worse than normal women who are having their period actually perform better
*15:11.860- 15:17.600* :  incognitive tests according to a new study the research which was described as surprising
*15:17.600- 15:23.700* :  found that women made fewer mistakes and had better mental agility than as other times during
*15:23.700- 15:30.080* :  their menstrual cycle. Oliver Conway has been talking to Dr. Flaminia Ronca from University College
*15:30.080- 15:35.180* :  London who was the lead author. We came to these findings because in sports medicine there's
*15:35.180- 15:39.740* :  quite a bit of research that suggests that female athletes tend to be more likely to sustain
*15:40.040- 15:44.900* :  injuries in contact sports during certain phases of the cycle sometimes ovulatory phase and the
*15:44.900- 15:50.420* :  luteal phase and many of the explanations out there try to look at by mechanical changes so
*15:50.420- 15:54.780* :  tended laxity for example and suggest that this is why we're seeing greater incidence of injuries
*15:55.420- 16:00.120* :  nobody has actually looked into sports related cognition until now so this is the first
*16:00.120- 16:05.060* :  of a series of studies of a larger project trying to understand if what might be causing a greater
*16:05.060- 16:10.160* :  risk of injury in specific phases is actually the timing of movements rather than specific changes
*16:10.320- 16:15.320* :  in biomechanics so this is how we came to this first proof of principle study where which we were
*16:15.320- 16:19.740* :  trying to understand whether a sports related cognition actually does change throughout the cycle
*16:20.320- 16:27.760* :  and it looks like it does. It does and in a way is actually better for those athletes while they're
*16:27.760- 16:32.420* :  having their period. Yes I think that the very positive message that we have here which we weren't
*16:32.420- 16:38.180* :  expecting was that our participants while they were on their period they reported were symptoms
*16:38.800- 16:43.140* :  they said that they thought these symptoms were negatively impacting their cognitive performance
*16:43.140- 16:47.120* :  on these tests but actually what we found is that they were performing better so they had
*16:47.600- 16:51.820* :  faster reaction times they were making very few errors it sets the premise for very positive
*16:51.820- 16:56.320* :  conversations between coaches and athletes to say that you know how your feeling doesn't necessarily
*16:56.320- 17:01.100* :  predict how you're going to perform we can push beyond and actually we might perform better
*17:01.100- 17:04.820* :  than we think so I think that's quite a positive message in terms of what's happening during the
*17:04.820- 17:09.620* :  period. What might be going on here? We know that during the menstrual cycle we have changes in
*17:09.620- 17:14.740* :  lots of different hormones the key hormones are estrogen and progesterone and during the
*17:14.740- 17:20.360* :  luteal phase which is about a week before our period the progesterone increases compared to the
*17:20.360- 17:25.880* :  rest of the cycle and we know that this hormone has an inhibitory effect on the cerebral cortex
*17:25.880- 17:31.540* :  what that means is that it calms the brain down a bit so it does make sense with our other
*17:31.540- 17:36.960* :  finding where we see slower reaction times in a luteal phase it makes sense at a mechanistic level
*17:36.960- 17:43.160* :  that higher progesterone levels might be driving slower reaction times I do have to stress this is
*17:43.160- 17:49.480* :  not a change in intelligence or ability it's purely slower reaction times during the luteal phase
*17:49.480- 17:54.380* :  and they didn't make any more mistakes during this phase either so it's simply a difference in the
*17:54.380- 17:59.620* :  timing of movements which might explain why we're seeing a greater incidence in injuries in this
*17:59.640- 18:04.700* :  phase but as always we need more studies with greater numbers and so we're working on this research
*18:04.700- 18:10.380* :  to try to understand more. Human physiology and exercise specialist Flaminia Ronca

*19:41.880- 19:46.760* :  There have been heavy Israeli air strikes in central Gaza where the army said that it
*19:46.760- 19:52.240* :  resumed attacking what it described as Hamas targets both above and below ground.
*19:52.240- 19:58.040* :  Medisansan Frontier also known as doctors without borders said the fresh military offensive
*19:58.040- 20:02.740* :  in the area had caused civilian casualties with women and children among the dead.
*20:02.780- 20:09.240* :  Karin Hooster is from the aid charity and has been to our AXA hospital in central Gaza.
*20:09.640- 20:16.220* :  The situation is apocalyptic. This morning on my way to the hospital I saw two donkeys carrying
*20:16.220- 20:22.860* :  the bodies of at least eight people who had died in the hostilities of the last night.
*20:23.700- 20:29.840* :  When we arrived the emergency room was completely packed. There were hundreds of people
*20:30.560- 20:36.860* :  who were inside the emergency department but also outside. There were family screaming. There
*20:36.860- 20:42.080* :  was a man screaming for his family that had died. While attacks on Gaza have resumed
*20:42.080- 20:47.400* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is prepared for very strong
*20:47.400- 20:53.480* :  action along its northern border with Lebanon. Conflicts between Israeli troops and the Iranian-backed
*20:53.480- 20:58.720* :  militant group Hezbollah have intensified over the past week. Mr Netanyahu is now facing
*20:58.720- 21:03.520* :  pressure to stop the rockets from Lebanon after they triggered bushfires in Israel.
*21:03.980- 21:07.460* :  Our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has this report.
*21:11.260- 21:16.840* :  Israel's Prime Minister is still promising security. Eight months after residents of northern
*21:16.840- 21:23.300* :  border areas moved out under fire from Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon. Today Benjamin Netanyahu
*21:23.300- 21:28.780* :  said he would restore security one way or the other. He's under new pressure to do it
*21:29.120- 21:34.600* :  after Hezbollah rockets sparked dozens of bushfires here and vivid headlines across the country.
*21:34.600- 21:41.520* :  To the left of the sandy road is Lebanon. Dean sweetland, a Londoner who now lives in
*21:41.520- 21:46.580* :  Kibbutz-Malkia right by the Lebanese border has been fighting the fires with a small group
*21:46.580- 21:52.560* :  of local residents who remain. Fire crews are sometimes blocked from tackling scrubland blazes
*21:52.560- 21:59.560* :  if the threat from Hezbollah rockets is seen as too high. Dean shows me the three rusty water trucks
*21:59.560- 22:05.520* :  they use to douse the flames and the handful of industrial leaf blowers to blow them away from
*22:05.520- 22:12.220* :  fresh scrubland. This is all we have, you know, and we're on our own. Ten, fifteen,
*22:13.140- 22:21.880* :  volunteers fighting the fires and the flames can be five, six meters tall. Sometimes you have to
*22:21.880- 22:26.520* :  leave it alone. You just can't get near it and we're fighting it with gardening tools.
*22:27.220- 22:32.700* :  The blazes here are a vivid reminder of the government's unmet promises. With the focus on Gaza,
*22:32.700- 22:38.200* :  Israel's leader has tried to keep this conflict contained, but some in his government are pushing
*22:38.200- 22:45.100* :  for war. As America pushes for a ceasefire in Gaza, Mr Netanyahu is facing a glaring reminder
*22:45.120- 22:50.440* :  of his other front line. Court between the war he hasn't finished in the south,
*22:51.160- 22:55.640* :  and the war he doesn't necessarily want to start. Lucy Williamson.
*22:56.660- 23:02.460* :  Next to Russia and the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. For years,
*23:02.460- 23:07.100* :  the forum was a place where executives of the world's biggest companies would meet Russia's leaders
*23:07.540- 23:12.000* :  looking for investment opportunities, leading it to be dubbed the Russian Davos.
*23:12.440- 23:17.460* :  Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions which followed have changed all that.
*23:17.460- 23:22.720* :  So what's this year's headline theme? According to the publicity material, it is
*23:23.040- 23:28.700* :  the formation of new centres of growth as the cornerstone of a multi-polar world.
*23:29.340- 23:33.100* :  The BBC's Russia, Edited Steve Rosenberg is there and told us more.
*23:34.100- 23:39.700* :  So I'm at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum right now. People used to call this
*23:40.160- 23:46.180* :  the Russian Davos, and I remember coming here in the past and seeing lots of CEOs of American
*23:46.180- 23:51.720* :  and European companies. I haven't seen any of those this time, but I have seen delegations from
*23:51.720- 23:57.340* :  the Middle East, from Asia, from Africa. And I think Russia will use this year's event to try
*23:57.340- 24:02.920* :  to show the world that, okay, we may be heavily sanctioned by the West over the war in Ukraine,
*24:02.940- 24:07.940* :  but there are still plenty of countries and regions of the world willing to do business
*24:07.940- 24:14.460* :  with Russia. China is of particular importance now to the Russian economy. You can see that.
*24:14.540- 24:18.760* :  One of the Russian banks has on its stand here a giant Chinese dragon.
*24:19.340- 24:23.860* :  Now President Putin will be appearing at the forum this week. He'll make a keynote address
*24:23.860- 24:30.020* :  on Friday. We'll watch to see what he says about Russia's war in Ukraine and about the economy.
*24:30.300- 24:36.360* :  To what extent Russia's economy has been put on a war footing, does Russia now have a war
*24:36.360- 24:41.540* :  economy? Certainly the authorities are pouring money into the military industrial complex,
*24:41.540- 24:46.260* :  into the defence sector. To a large extent it's that money which is fueling economic growth
*24:46.780- 24:51.280* :  in Russia right now. How sustainable that is and the long term remains to be seen.
*24:52.300- 24:57.860* :  Anastasia Shapokhina, the founder of the Eastern Circles Geo-economics think tank,
*24:58.260- 25:03.620* :  told Will Beyn about how Moscow was turning towards the East and the South to counter the
*25:03.620- 25:09.640* :  impact of Western sanctions. Putting up Chinese dragons on their stands are the signs of
*25:09.640- 25:16.020* :  reorientation of the Russian economy, toward the East, so they are China comes first, but also
*25:16.020- 25:21.940* :  the rest of the world. It's also the Middle East, it's also Africa and Latin America and those
*25:21.940- 25:28.800* :  countries among these continents which accept trade with Russia for example in their local currencies
*25:29.400- 25:35.520* :  which serve as hubs for transferring goods to Russia which are banned by Western countries
*25:35.520- 25:39.340* :  which fall under the US. And just give people a sense of that balance
*25:39.380- 25:45.080* :  Anastasia. What is that? Is that those countries buying natural resources from us or is it
*25:45.200- 25:48.800* :  products? Is it services? What is it that's going in East direction and what's the balance?
*25:50.140- 25:55.260* :  It depends really on the country if we take China and India for example, they have become
*25:55.260- 26:01.980* :  absolutely crucial for accepting about 80% of Russia's oil experts. So India takes out about
*26:01.980- 26:08.780* :  30% Russian oil experts and China about 50%. A lot of that is redirected toward Europe and
*26:08.780- 26:15.920* :  now no longer Russian oil and some of it is refined and then some of it is redirected as well
*26:16.300- 26:22.440* :  toward Europe. Another function which is not so much critical for the Russian budget as oil
*26:22.440- 26:29.220* :  experts are but is absolutely critical for the military effort is imports into Russia of critical
*26:29.220- 26:36.920* :  military material including W's goods like the chips which are used in rockets and planes which
*26:36.920- 26:42.220* :  are prohibited by the sanctions but are imported through China or through third countries to which
*26:42.220- 26:49.040* :  China quote unquote sells like Serbia or Kyrgyzstan for example. So these are the crucial aspects of
*26:49.040- 26:54.980* :  the importance for the trade and also in spite of financial sanctions which can limit Russia's
*26:55.180- 27:00.980* :  existence within the swift banking system than the willingness of big players like China or India
*27:01.440- 27:07.960* :  or the Middle East countries to trade with Russia in local currencies also reinforces its economy
*27:07.960- 27:13.440* :  and gives it a bloodline that helps it to continue the worth it. And the stars yes, Shapakina.
*27:14.420- 27:20.140* :  Boeing has successfully launched a new spacecraft on its first crude flight to the International
*27:20.140- 27:25.980* :  Space Station to NASA astronauts boarded the Starliner capsule before it blasted off from Cape
*27:25.980- 27:31.740* :  Canaveral in Florida. The mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the
*27:31.740- 27:39.820* :  development of the rocket. Our science correspondent Palab Goshe has this report five four three two one
*27:41.580- 27:47.340* :  and liftoff. Finally Boeing Starliner spacecraft has made it up into the sky
*27:47.880- 27:50.560* :  and is on its way to the International Space Station.
*27:52.940- 27:57.940* :  So far the mission has gone to plan. The two astronauts will be testing out the spacecraft
*27:57.940- 28:03.060* :  systems before docking with the space station. It was third time lucky for the launch
*28:03.480- 28:08.800* :  aborted twice in the past four weeks because of technical issues with the rocket and this first
*28:08.800- 28:14.780* :  test flight with the crew has been delayed by almost a decade because of other technical problems
*28:14.780- 28:21.180* :  in Starliner's development. But Boeing's Mark Nappy says that engineers have worked hard to fix
*28:21.180- 28:25.420* :  those issues. When you're playing a game and you get a bad call and you're a little irritated
*28:25.420- 28:30.300* :  at first or a little frustrated at first but you immediately focus on the next pitch and that's
*28:30.300- 28:35.520* :  what our teams do. They're focused on the next pitch. If this mission goes well, Starliner will
*28:35.520- 28:41.380* :  be certified for regular supply trips to the ISS. That will mean that along with SpaceX,
*28:42.040- 28:46.760* :  there'll now be two private sector firms taking astronauts to the orbiting laboratory
*28:47.440- 28:50.040* :  which should bring down the costs of human spaceflight.
*28:52.380- 28:58.440* :  In order to get a good night's sleep, the advice has long been to stay away from devices that
*28:58.440- 29:04.720* :  emit blue light, such as smartphones, tablets and television screens. Well, the review of 11
*29:04.720- 29:10.200* :  worldwide sleep studies claims that advice is wrong, concluding there was very little
*29:10.200- 29:16.280* :  if any evidence that screen light makes it harder to fall asleep. Ella Bicknell told me more.
*29:16.520- 29:21.840* :  Blue light is a colour on the light spectrum that has a very short wavelength and that means it
*29:21.840- 29:26.720* :  easy penetrates the eye through the cornea, the lens and then into the retina. And that penetration
*29:26.720- 29:31.380* :  scientists thought makes it harder for us to get to sleep and harder for us to get that deep
*29:31.380- 29:35.980* :  REM sleep. You know, that kind of sleep that helps our bodies generate melatonin and recover
*29:35.980- 29:41.580* :  for the next day. And because pretty much all electronic devices emit blue light, that's
*29:41.580- 29:46.700* :  things like television screens and smartphones, that's why the general advice so far has been not
*29:46.700- 29:51.580* :  to use them before beds. But this study says blue light is not so harmful.
*29:52.200- 29:56.600* :  So this report is from the Medical Journal's Sleep Medicine and it's a meta study, so it looks
*29:56.600- 30:01.540* :  at the data across 11 global sleep studies. And the trend that these scientists found is that
*30:01.540- 30:06.820* :  blue light made little difference on sleep quality. And most blue light from screens only delay
*30:06.820- 30:12.240* :  people sleep by about 10 minutes. However, all those these scientists say that blue light makes
*30:12.240- 30:17.860* :  little difference, screens themselves still can, but it all depends on how you're using it in an
*30:17.860- 30:22.000* :  interactive way or a passive way. And what I mean by that interactive, that's things like checking
*30:22.000- 30:27.020* :  emails, social media, anything that keeps that brain ticking or keeps you up in a more anxious
*30:27.020- 30:31.900* :  state, or are using your device in a passive way, so a way that relaxes you, for example,
*30:31.900- 30:37.140* :  reading or watching a movie. In that case, using a screen might actually be beneficial if you're
*30:37.140- 30:42.680* :  using it before sleep. Michael Greta-Sight is a clinical psychologist and the co-writer of this
*30:42.680- 30:47.860* :  paper. He said one study in particular show that this is especially the case among adolescents.
*30:48.660- 30:55.220* :  We surveyed about 700 teenagers and we found that they do use their technology to be able to
*30:55.420- 30:59.200* :  pass the time until they fall asleep because a lot of teenagers fall asleep late. But the key
*30:59.220- 31:03.440* :  thing is that they probably do that because when they don't, they start to have all these worrying
*31:03.440- 31:07.480* :  thoughts that are going through their mind because when the lights are off and things are quiet,
*31:07.480- 31:11.320* :  we have a lot of background thoughts. And they can be about what I've got to do tomorrow,
*31:11.320- 31:15.960* :  what happened bad that happened today. And so to distract ourselves from those thoughts,
*31:16.300- 31:22.900* :  short read, watch Netflix, something like that. So it's not as harmful as what a lot of people say.
*31:23.580- 31:28.920* :  That's Michael Greta-Sight. Like I said, who co-wrote this paper. He also found that among some
*31:28.920- 31:33.900* :  participants, even playing violent video games or watching one of those late night high-octane
*31:33.900- 31:39.260* :  TV episodes with a cliffhanger actually had little effect on sleep quality, like some people could
*31:39.260- 31:43.340* :  drift off with no problem whatsoever. So the conclusion of this paper is that screens
*31:43.340- 31:49.060* :  effect as all differently, but the blue light factor is not the most crucial part in determining
*31:49.060- 31:53.060* :  our quality of sleep. Around the authors behind the study are calling for more research.
*31:53.800- 31:58.820* :  Well, yes, because billions of us use blue light devices, especially before beds. In the UK,
*31:58.820- 32:04.340* :  for example, the research body Yugove found that 84% of people look at their phones at least an
*32:04.380- 32:08.560* :  hour before bed, and it's expected that number is high in places such as the United States.
*32:09.120- 32:13.500* :  And we know that sleep matters. It affects our physical health, our productivity, our mood,
*32:13.500- 32:18.020* :  our relationships. So if we're taking measures to improve it, whether that's avoiding your phone
*32:18.020- 32:22.280* :  before bed or even wearing blue light glasses, which is a billion dollar industry,
*32:22.800- 32:26.680* :  these scientists say that we need to know whether the actions we're taking is actually making a
*32:26.680- 32:35.720* :  difference. Ella Bicknell. And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new version of the
