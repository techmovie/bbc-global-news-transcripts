*01:32.300- 01:35.700* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:36.620- 01:42.260* :  I'm Alex Richardson and in the early hours of Friday the 7th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:42.800- 01:48.400* :  Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail for the first time since he was convicted of 34 counts
*01:48.400- 01:53.420* :  of fraud. So we're watching it very carefully and I'm working my ass off to make sure we get
*01:57.360- 02:01.880* :  the United Nations says 35 children have been killed in one of the worst attacks in
*02:01.880- 02:07.380* :  sedan civil war. The war and the violations from the rapid support militia makes my body shiver
*02:07.700- 02:14.400* :  and are disgusting and unimaginable. Also in this podcast, in fact they've been exposed to a
*02:14.400- 02:19.660* :  cocktail of different drugs that can have all sorts of negative effects on wildlife and the
*02:19.660- 02:26.220* :  ecosystems they inhabit. How wild fish are becoming hooked on methamphetamine and other hardcore drugs.
*02:29.400- 02:34.380* :  Donald Trump has made his first campaign appearance since his criminal conviction for fraud
*02:34.380- 02:39.680* :  addressing a friendly audience in Arizona. Let me tell you if we could have honest
*02:39.680- 02:44.280* :  elections in this country, I would have stopped campaigning two weeks ago we would have had it
*02:44.280- 02:50.320* :  made. But we don't have that so we're watching it very carefully and I'm working my ass off to make
*02:50.320- 02:57.040* :  sure we get too big to drink too big. The supporters came out in force hundreds
*02:57.040- 03:03.100* :  queued in sweltering temperatures to get into the mega church in Phoenix. We're out here supporting
*03:03.100- 03:11.000* :  Trump and it is excruciatingly hot out here, freezing bottles of water to cold down our kids.
*03:12.880- 03:18.680* :  Yeah it's uncomfortable but for us the discomfort that Trump's been put under by the
*03:19.120- 03:25.200* :  heat from the left and so for us coming out is the least we can do to support him at this point
*03:25.200- 03:30.360* :  because I mean the persecution is relentless so for us coming out in the heat isn't a big deal
*03:30.360- 03:35.520* :  to show our support because for us it's not just supporting Trump. We're supporting the upholding
*03:35.520- 03:42.940* :  of America really. It's hot and no matter how much water you use to pull yourself off it dries
*03:42.940- 03:50.120* :  up and you're just sweating and cooking out here in the heat. Mr. Trump attacked President Biden's
*03:50.120- 03:55.720* :  record on migration on the southern border. He also repeated his baseless assertions that the
*03:55.720- 04:01.400* :  recent court case in New York has rigged and the charges against him were fabricated. Our
*04:01.400- 04:07.220* :  reporter Emma Vardy was at the rally and spoke to me while Mr. Trump continued addressing the crowd.
*04:07.820- 04:13.260* :  Certainly among people here when you talk to them people say it's a sham and they see it as a
*04:13.260- 04:18.240* :  politically motivated trial. People are I feel like relishing the opportunity to demonstrate what
*04:18.240- 04:23.660* :  they think of that conviction. People are wearing Trump's police mugshot on t-shirts. They are
*04:23.660- 04:30.120* :  holding up his police mugshot on placards saying never surrender. One Trump's aborder I spoke to
*04:30.120- 04:35.360* :  she said to me look this is what we do when they try to attack him we turn it around and we use
*04:35.360- 04:41.240* :  it as a PR opportunity and that's what Trump has done throughout his trial. Do these types of
*04:41.240- 04:47.200* :  events tend to result in large amounts of donations for his campaign? Well a lot of
*04:47.200- 04:52.280* :  leading Republicans rallied behind Trump since his conviction he's had a lot of big donations
*04:52.540- 04:57.820* :  from here in Silicon Valley too and he's been paying tribute to people today and he's been
*04:57.820- 05:02.080* :  boasting about those donations in fact the Trump campaign saying it's one of its busiest periods
*05:02.620- 05:07.940* :  of donations ever since he was convicted but of course as you say this is a very friendly
*05:07.940- 05:13.960* :  audience here but Arizona is in fact a very narrowly closely run race in the presidential election.
*05:14.000- 05:21.320* :  It was won by Trump in 2016, narrowly won back by Joe Biden in 2020 and the campaign
*05:21.320- 05:26.360* :  know that this is a must win state for anybody who wants to win the presidency and I was talking
*05:26.360- 05:30.820* :  to a few undecided voters not the sort of people you'd find at a Trump rally but people away from
*05:30.860- 05:36.640* :  here in Phoenix this morning and there's an awful lot of apathy about this Joe Biden Donald Trump
*05:36.680- 05:40.960* :  rematch. Some people I was talking to said they voted their whole lives but didn't feel
*05:40.960- 05:46.020* :  enthused to turn out once again and make a decision between these two candidates taking each
*05:46.020- 05:51.360* :  up on take you taking each one up again so you know we're seeing more evidence yet again that it
*05:51.360- 05:56.180* :  could be the in a very closely one state like this the sign that gets its vote out the most
*05:56.180- 06:01.320* :  successfully that could make all the difference. Emma Vardy meanwhile Donald Trump's former advisor
*06:01.320- 06:06.660* :  Steve Bannon has been ordered to report to prison to serve a four-month sentence for contempt of
*06:06.660- 06:11.780* :  Congress. Last month Mr Bannon lost an appeal to overturn the federal court conviction.
*06:11.780- 06:18.440* :  It found him guilty of refusing to give evidence in an investigation into the US capital attacks
*06:18.920- 06:26.200* :  in January 2021. Mr Bannon says he'll appeal to the Supreme Court. Nomi Iqbal is our North America
*06:26.980- 06:31.260* :  correspondent. He was a key strategist for Donald Trump. He didn't actually serve in the Trump
*06:31.260- 06:35.160* :  administration in the final months but he's still been this huge influence on the president and
*06:35.160- 06:40.540* :  certainly on the political base. It was back in 2022 when he was convicted for defying that
*06:40.540- 06:46.780* :  subpoena of the January six committee sentence to four months in jail but the judge in the case
*06:46.780- 06:53.220* :  agreed to let him appeal and to be on bail during that time but it was back in May when a federal
*06:53.220- 06:58.520* :  appeals court unanimously upheld that conviction and so now the judges come back and said right
*06:58.520- 07:04.040* :  I'm ordering you to jail on July the first so that lead up to the presidential election.
*07:04.040- 07:12.000* :  It's worth mentioning also that there is another Trump advisor who is already in jail serving
*07:12.000- 07:16.800* :  a sentence over a similar charge. Peter Navarro he was a Donald Trump's trade advisor.
*07:17.340- 07:22.460* :  He was also convicted of contempt of Congress and when that happened that was the first time in
*07:22.460- 07:28.100* :  half a century that that sort of charge had been brought forward and someone was convicted over it.
*07:28.500- 07:35.340* :  Nomiya Ikbal. The US election in November is just one of many we've been covering by the end of
*07:35.340- 07:42.220* :  2024 more than 50 countries and two billion voters will have gone to the polls. Here in the UK a
*07:42.220- 07:48.340* :  snap general election is taking place in just four weeks on the 4th of July. It's shaping up to be
*07:48.340- 07:53.560* :  one for the history books with both of the main parties needing to break records in order to form
*07:53.560- 07:58.960* :  a government. If you have any questions ahead of the vote from the main issues at stake to the
*07:58.960- 08:04.600* :  main players the global news podcast team would love to hear from you. You can email us at global
*08:04.600- 08:14.620* :  podcast at bbce.co.uk. You can also find us on x at global news pod. Now to sit down where we
*08:14.620- 08:20.040* :  hear reports of further bloodshed and violence this time in central jazera state a United
*08:20.040- 08:25.860* :  Nations agency says that 35 children were killed in Wednesdays attack by the rapid support forces
*08:25.860- 08:32.120* :  in the village of wad al-nura. The rsf has only said that it attacked a Sudanese army post in the
*08:32.120- 08:39.900* :  area. A deputy africa editor and soy reports. It's yet another grim reminder of how children in Sudan
*08:39.900- 08:45.120* :  have paid the price for the brutal violence said UNICEF's executive director Catherine Russell.
*08:45.800- 08:50.760* :  She described the scenes in wad al-nura village as devastating. The village neighborhood
*08:50.760- 08:56.880* :  group said RSF fighters struck on Wednesday with heavy artillery killing at least 100 people.
*08:57.440- 09:02.580* :  Some estimates put the death toll at about 200. The UN resident coordinator in Sudan
*09:02.580- 09:08.360* :  Clementine and Quetta Salami has called for an investigation into the attack. A pro-democracy
*09:08.360- 09:14.080* :  lawyers group in the country called it a war crime. The war between the rsf and the Sudanese
*09:14.080- 09:18.680* :  government has killed many tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 9 million.
*09:19.240- 09:24.180* :  We've been in touch with a man who fled his home in jazera state a week ago. In a voice message
*09:24.180- 09:39.120* :  he told us that decision saved his life. My personal tragedy is very bitter. My cousins were killed
*09:39.120- 09:44.660* :  in their homes. The women were raped and our money was looted. The rest of the family was
*09:44.660- 09:49.980* :  assaulted and attacked. I was forcibly displaced. We've heard of all the wars that happened in
*09:49.980- 09:54.800* :  other countries, but the war and the violations from the rapid support militia makes my body
*09:54.800- 10:05.680* :  shiver and are disgusting and unimaginable. A man displaced by the war in Sudan.
*10:06.840- 10:12.000* :  Scientists say that many of the drugs we take routinely, antidegressive contraceptives,
*10:12.000- 10:17.240* :  even caffeine, are contaminating our waterways and having a significant effect on wildlife.
*10:17.240- 10:23.240* :  And that's before you consider the impact of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine.
*10:23.700- 10:28.540* :  In a paper published this week in the journal Nature Sustainability, researchers say pharmaceutical
*10:28.540- 10:34.560* :  companies need to improve how quickly their drugs break down in the environment. Michael Bertram
*10:34.560- 10:39.100* :  is one of the researchers from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.
*10:39.860- 10:46.140* :  Recent studies surveyed 104 countries and found the wide range of different drugs in river water
*10:46.140- 10:51.300* :  all around the world. The most contaminated system had a mixture of 34 different pharmaceuticals.
*10:51.460- 10:56.160* :  So the message here is not necessarily that a fish is being exposed to any single drug. In fact,
*10:56.160- 11:00.680* :  they're being exposed to a cocktail of different drugs that can have all sorts of negative effects
*11:00.680- 11:06.040* :  on wildlife and the ecosystems they inhabit. Prescription medications but also illicit drugs
*11:06.280- 11:12.900* :  like anti-anxiety medications, for instance, have been found to reduce the anxiety and anti-predator
*11:12.900- 11:17.640* :  behavior of fish. This is concerning given that prey fish should be scared of their predators
*11:17.640- 11:22.280* :  and these fish aren't antibiotics. For example, have been widely detected at the environment
*11:22.280- 11:28.580* :  with major implications for antimicrobial resistance. So the focus today in terms of
*11:28.580- 11:33.900* :  greening the pharmaceutical sector has been primarily on developing to reduce, for example,
*11:33.900- 11:38.340* :  carbon emissions or to reduce the amount of plastics that are used in pharmaceutical products
*11:38.720- 11:43.140* :  in terms of packaging. What we're concluding in this new article is that there needs to be a
*11:43.140- 11:48.180* :  renewed focus on actually developing pharmaceuticals that actively degrade in the environment.
*11:48.240- 11:53.880* :  The focus on that has been quite limited to date and we need to make an effort to develop
*11:53.880- 11:59.940* :  more greener drugs. Dr. Michael Bertram from the Swedish University of Agriculture Sciences
*12:01.140- 12:06.260* :  still to come in the global news podcast. The struggle between a dictatorship and freedom
*12:07.220- 12:12.460* :  is unending. Here in Europe, we see one stark example.
*12:13.660- 12:18.880* :  US President Joe Biden draws parallels between World War II and Russia's invasion of Ukraine
*12:19.460- 12:22.960* :  as Western leaders mark 80 years since the D-Day landings.
*13:01.240- 13:05.880* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*13:06.160- 13:10.680* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little. So naturally, when they announced that
*13:10.680- 13:16.260* :  be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*13:16.520- 13:21.520* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*13:35.840- 13:40.620* :  In our last edition of this podcast, we heard that the ruling military council in Myanmar
*13:40.620- 13:46.920* :  has denied accusations that army troops killed at least 50 people in a village in Rakhine state
*13:46.920- 13:52.080* :  in the West. They were looking for supporters of the Arakhan army, which has become one of the most
*13:52.080- 13:58.240* :  effective ethnic fighting forces in Myanmar, causing the military junta to lose control of huge
*13:58.240- 14:05.080* :  swathes of territory, including further north in Chin state. There, the BBC has been given rare
*14:05.080- 14:10.940* :  access and seen evidence showing how the Burmese army has used torture, abduction, and murder
*14:10.940- 14:17.160* :  to stop young protesters joining the rebel fighters. Correspondent Yogi Tehlemaye sent this report.
*14:24.020- 14:29.780* :  Hundreds of young recruits are marching in a big open field under the scorching sun. We're
*14:29.780- 14:34.520* :  surrounded by lush green mountains. We're at Victoria Base, which is the main headquarters
*14:34.540- 14:41.040* :  of the Chin National Army. It's one of the rebel military groups that's been fighting against
*14:41.040- 14:46.700* :  Myanmar as militia. And over the past six months, this particular rebel group has made significant
*14:53.300- 14:57.900* :  advances in this area. Our motherland, the land we love, they sing. We'll defend it with our
*14:57.900- 15:03.600* :  blood and life. Three years ago, Myanmar's fragile democracy was crushed by a coup,
*15:04.260- 15:10.420* :  but now the military junta is facing an unprecedented challenge. People in many parts of the country
*15:10.420- 15:19.600* :  are rising to fight against them, like 19-year-old Tandarlin. The first year after the coup
*15:19.600- 15:25.720* :  wasn't too bad, but then the military began shelling our village. It destroyed our home,
*15:26.400- 15:32.380* :  troop-centered our village, burnt houses, and killed people. My uncle was cruelly shot dead.
*15:36.440- 15:41.300* :  Driving through mountainous terrain, through heavily wooded forests, I've come to the village of
*15:41.440- 15:45.720* :  Haimul. One of the things you see is on both sides of the road, there are quite a few burnt out
*15:45.800- 15:51.020* :  homes. Somewhere, literally there are a couple of pillars, wooden pillars standing and no other
*15:51.020- 15:57.980* :  structure left. This is just everywhere you can see kind of charred walls. Pretty much nothing
*15:57.980- 16:04.520* :  remains. Across Myanmar, allegations have been made by civil rights groups that tens of thousands
*16:04.520- 16:11.040* :  of homes were torched by the junta. There was a steady battle between resistance groups and the
*16:11.080- 16:16.840* :  military junta, and we're just about to speak to the commander, his name is Vala.
*16:18.320- 16:24.020* :  Can you tell me what was your job before 2021, and why did you decide to join the people's
*16:24.020- 16:33.620* :  defence forces then? Before 2021, I'm driving track. We don't want a dictatorship. We need a
*16:33.620- 16:39.800* :  federal democracy government. And how does your family feel about you being on a frontline?
*16:40.760- 16:47.760* :  Sometimes they are so worried about me, but I must do this job for my son, my family,
*16:48.340- 16:49.880* :  for our people, for our country.
*16:53.300- 17:00.160* :  For Tesla, Oda and Space Entrepreneur Elon Musk, Thursday was fourth time lucky launching the
*17:00.160- 17:05.700* :  biggest rocket ever built. This SpaceX test is aiming to send a rocket into space and
*17:05.700- 17:11.600* :  have it return in a condition to be used again and is key for NASA's goal of returning humans
*17:11.600- 17:17.680* :  to the moon by 2026. Rachel Wright has more. We are past the 42nd mark.
*17:18.240- 17:23.800* :  It's 750 US central time at Starbase in Boko Chica, Texas. Imagine the scene,
*17:24.140- 17:31.080* :  a 121 meter rocket the largest ever built in the clutch of a huge metal class wreathed in
*17:38.060- 17:42.120* :  smoke and fire. That noise represented twice the thrust of the rocket that sent men to the moon.
*17:42.720- 17:47.340* :  It's the fourth test flight for Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship Development Program.
*17:47.340- 17:52.840* :  The first didn't get into space, the last two did, but broke up during reentry into the atmosphere.
*17:53.460- 17:56.940* :  Engineers at Starship Headquarters in Texas were very excited.
*18:06.040- 18:09.640* :  And that's just the booster rocket landing safely into the Gulf of Mexico.
*18:10.240- 18:13.400* :  The main Starship module was then coasting through space.
*18:13.400- 18:18.940* :  The engineers waited with baited breath for the next bit. Would it, like the other two before it,
*18:18.940- 18:21.560* :  disintegrate when it re-entered Earth's atmosphere?
*18:22.000- 18:28.400* :  This is a nail-biter. All the data is incredibly important, even if it breaks up right now.
*18:31.100- 18:32.780* :  And then the cameras started to work.
*18:37.800- 18:40.680* :  The landing bird shutdown was commanded.
*18:43.500- 18:48.460* :  The engineers understandably delighted because even though bits were falling off it,
*18:48.460- 18:54.820* :  the spaceship did have a soft landing in the sea. If they can perfect Starship, it'll be revolutionary.
*18:54.860- 19:01.780* :  It's intended to be fully and rapidly reusable to operate much like an airplane that can be refueled
*19:01.780- 19:07.700* :  and put back in the air in short order. All previous spaceships have been partially or entirely
*19:07.700- 19:12.980* :  expendable. A fully functional Starship would radically lower the cost of space activity.
*19:13.020- 19:19.680* :  It's also the key to realising Elon Musk's long-held ambition to take people and supplies to Mars.
*19:20.200- 19:25.320* :  And crucially, it's all at the service of NASA, which wants to use it to put astronauts
*19:25.320- 19:31.260* :  back on the moon. SpaceX isn't the only company developing rockets to help NASA out.
*19:31.700- 19:36.220* :  The aircraft producer Boeing is running a rival programme and today one of its
*19:36.220- 19:41.620* :  Starliners successfully docked and delivered astronauts to the International Space Station.
*19:42.540- 19:45.620* :  Lots of cheering here in the room. Big hugs.
*19:46.640- 19:49.260* :  Sunny willian coming through in her blue flight suit.
*19:50.620- 19:54.760* :  And followed shortly behind by Commander of Starliner, Butch Wilmore,
*19:55.320- 19:59.140* :  now back on the space station, the third visit for both astronauts and the first
*19:59.140- 20:04.420* :  crude flight test of the Starliner spacecraft. A successful day for Boeing,
*20:04.420- 20:08.460* :  but they're still four years behind Elon Musk's SpaceX.
*20:34.380- 20:43.700* :  There's been fighting all over the Donetsk region, but this is I think I'm finished business,
*20:43.700- 20:50.400* :  because in July 2022, just a few months after the full-scale Russian invasion,
*20:50.460- 20:55.720* :  President Zelensky ordered mandatory evacuation of all children from Donetsk region.
*20:56.620- 21:00.740* :  But it never followed it up, so I don't know how many were evacuated.
*21:01.240- 21:04.540* :  Presumably there wasn't many places they could go.
*21:05.300- 21:11.860* :  So now I would explain the timing, surprisingly, by the Russian offensive in Harkiv
*21:12.280- 21:16.740* :  to the north of Donetsk region. Because if you remember the past few months,
*21:16.780- 21:23.420* :  the Russians have been advancing inexorably on the north-eastern front,
*21:24.360- 21:30.520* :  trying to, I would say, not capture Harkiv, but maybe spook the Ukrainians to
*21:30.520- 21:35.040* :  make them pull their forces from the east to the north-east.
*21:35.620- 21:40.220* :  And I think that's what happened. They pulled them, and just two nights ago,
*21:41.040- 21:44.200* :  President Zelensky in his nightly video address,
*21:45.140- 21:51.980* :  said that the main front line is no longer around Harkiv, but back around Donetsk.
*21:52.460- 21:59.080* :  When we say Donetsk, we mean Bachmut, Avdiv, Liemann, which was briefly held by the Russians,
*21:59.080- 22:04.080* :  Russians are trying to retake it again. So that's where all the fighting is.
*22:04.500- 22:06.100* :  I don't think it's an accident that the other day,
*22:06.220- 22:13.540* :  President Zelensky said that this was the main front line, and today the Ukrainian
*22:13.540- 22:20.740* :  governor of Donetsk region said that all children plus the guardians have to evacuate,
*22:20.740- 22:22.820* :  although not specifying where to.
*22:23.120- 22:28.940* :  So does this mean that the Ukrainian authorities are expecting another Russian push,
*22:28.940- 22:31.520* :  or does it mean they're planning a push of their own?
*22:31.880- 22:38.180* :  I think the Ukrainians feel that the Russians are pushing westwards around Donetsk,
*22:38.400- 22:44.920* :  trying to capture Liemann, Chasiv Yar, and of course their main target would be Kramatorsk,
*22:45.080- 22:51.960* :  which is now the only proper big city held by Ukraine in Donetsk region.
*22:52.980- 22:56.380* :  So that's where the fighting will probably be.
*22:59.160- 23:03.260* :  Ukraine was at the front of many people's minds during ceremonies in France,
*23:03.260- 23:09.360* :  marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day when Allied troops landed in France to start driving out
*23:09.360- 23:14.880* :  the Nazis. Beaders from France, the US and Britain were present on the beaches of Normandy,
*23:15.380- 23:21.180* :  but it wasn't President Putin of Russia who marked the sacrifices of the former Soviet Union.
*23:21.860- 23:27.420* :  Instead, President Zelensky of Ukraine, another former member of the ex-Soviet Union,
*23:27.420- 23:33.580* :  took the honors. He heard President J. Biden urge Western powers to continue their support for Ukraine.
*23:34.700- 23:38.440* :  The struggle between the dictatorship and freedom is unending.
*23:39.600- 23:43.020* :  Here in Europe, we see one stark example.
*23:44.000- 23:48.600* :  Ukraine has been invaded by a tyrant, then on domination.
*23:49.880- 23:54.580* :  Ukraine is our fighting with extraordinary courage, suffering great losses,
*23:55.400- 24:01.980* :  but never backing down. The United States and NATO and a coalition of more than 50 countries
*24:03.140- 24:08.000* :  stand strong with Ukraine. We will not walk away.
*24:11.200- 24:15.740* :  President Emmanuel Macron of France presented his country's highest military ward,
*24:15.740- 24:24.180* :  the Legion, the near two veterans. France will never forget the British troops who landed on D-Day
*24:24.840- 24:30.640* :  and all their brothers in arms, that face and freedom which you have never lost,
*24:31.860- 24:40.900* :  that constant selflessness and devotion both guide us and serve as a duty to us.
*24:43.080- 24:50.040* :  We are honored by the size of remembrance, friendship and loyalty which you have fought
*24:51.000- 24:55.540* :  between our two countries and let me thank all of you for this bravery.
*25:10.300- 25:19.400* :  I must commit to carrying forward their resounding message of courage and resilience in the pursuit of freedom.
*25:22.040- 25:25.820* :  I shall all be back. I'll be back to seeing you, Darwin. I'm in that.
*25:28.720- 25:33.800* :  I'm not a hero. They only here old in any war are the ones that don't come back.
*25:36.100- 25:42.900* :  I've really had the war in my ears and it made me very much aware of what was at stake.
*25:46.480- 25:52.300* :  Our gratitude is unfair and our admiration he turned.
*26:10.200- 26:14.560* :  Our Europe editor, Katia Adler, has been looking at the legacy of D-Day.
*26:15.300- 26:19.140* :  Europe's new war hung heavy over today's D-Day commemorations.
*26:19.140- 26:25.240* :  Modern-day geopolitics loomed large but the world leaders gathered here meant no disrespect.
*26:25.260- 26:31.220* :  The gratitude Joe Biden, France's Emmanuel Macron, the King and others today expressed
*26:31.220- 26:36.660* :  to the Allied servicemen and women who risked and lost their lives in France was heartfelt.
*26:37.460- 26:43.240* :  But concerns about Russia's bloody onslaught in Ukraine and fears of further destabilization in
*26:43.240- 26:49.620* :  Europe were also palpable. In the US military cemetery this morning, President Biden urged allies
*26:49.620- 26:55.880* :  to be unflinching against those he called tyrants. Remembering what happened yesterday doesn't absolve
*26:55.880- 27:01.980* :  what we have to do today, he said. The valiant veterans who made it today to Normandy know only
*27:01.980- 27:08.140* :  too well the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism, aggressive nationalism and the politics of hate.
*27:09.060- 27:12.800* :  The liberty and peace they sacrificed so much for is fracturing.
*27:16.880- 27:22.200* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Glowounis podcast later.

*27:37.660- 27:42.500* :  This edition was mixed by Peter Weiss and the producer was Ella Bicknull.
*27:42.680- 27:48.120* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson until next time. Goodbye.
*27:57.060- 28:00.880* :  Gail Katz told friends she was leaving her husband Bob then went missing.
*28:00.880- 28:06.360* :  On season one of the Girlfriends, Bob's ex-girlfriends came together to bring him down and seek justice.
*28:06.600- 28:12.020* :  I can't believe this. Now on season two, host Carol Fisher is back working to solve the mystery
*28:12.020- 28:17.300* :  of another missing woman. It's almost like it's become this moral obligation to find her.
*28:17.380- 28:21.260* :  Listen to the Girlfriends, our lost sister, on America's number one podcast network.
*28:21.380- 28:26.260* :  I Heart. Open your free I Heart app and search the Girlfriends, our lost sister, and start listening.
