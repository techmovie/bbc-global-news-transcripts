*01:20.940- 01:24.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.180- 01:31.020* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 10th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:31.680- 01:34.120* :  The far right have made gains in the European elections,
*01:34.120- 01:37.940* :  but the EU Commission Chief insists the centre is solid.
*01:38.300- 01:40.520* :  We look at the results from across Europe.
*01:41.360- 01:45.620* :  The BBC speaks to the widow of the IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
*01:46.060- 01:51.200* :  about the persecution of Yazidis in Iraq as they try to claim compensation from her.
*01:51.720- 01:53.600* :  At the time, I felt ashamed.
*01:54.280- 01:57.360* :  How is it that women could be degraded to such an extent?
*01:58.140- 02:01.320* :  I was entirely against it, but I was a helpless woman.
*02:04.660- 02:05.540* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:05.880- 02:08.260* :  people are being expelled from schools,
*02:08.260- 02:11.700* :  some people are being rejected by their own family members,
*02:12.420- 02:14.740* :  simply because of who we are.
*02:23.920- 02:26.480* :  We begin with a fallout from the European elections.
*02:27.100- 02:29.980* :  The EU Parliament has seen an overall swing to the right.
*02:30.720- 02:32.780* :  Centre right parties strengthen their majority,
*02:32.780- 02:36.320* :  winning in Germany, Greece, Poland and Spain.
*02:37.000- 02:42.160* :  The European Commission Chief Ursula von Delayen said this showed that the centre was solid.
*02:42.880- 02:50.200* :  The centre is holding, but it is also true that the extremes on the left and on the right
*02:50.220- 02:56.700* :  have gained support, and this is why the result comes with great responsibility
*02:57.680- 02:59.460* :  for the parties in the centre.
*03:00.400- 03:03.880* :  But the far right triumphed in several countries, including France.
*03:03.880- 03:09.080* :  President Macron called snap parliamentary elections after his party was trounced
*03:09.080- 03:13.820* :  by the populist anti-immigrant national rally of his long-time rival,
*03:14.160- 03:15.160* :  Marine Le Pen.
*03:15.160- 03:17.600* :  Husco Field is our Paris correspondent.
*03:18.260- 03:22.300* :  A leap into the unknown is how the French media is describing President Macron's
*03:22.300- 03:27.380* :  built from the blue. Many are asking how he could have decided on such a risky endeavour as
*03:27.380- 03:31.960* :  to dissolve Parliament when it's obvious the national rally is riding high.
*03:32.380- 03:37.260* :  If it can repeat its triumph at the Europeans, then the prospect of a hard-right government
*03:37.260- 03:40.600* :  sharing power with President Macron is very real.
*03:41.260- 03:44.660* :  His calculation seems to be that voters will come back to the mainstream
*03:44.660- 03:49.860* :  when they're choosing their own MPs, and that Marine Le Pen's party will ultimately be
*03:49.860- 03:53.240* :  unable to form a majority. But he can't be sure of that.
*03:53.660- 03:57.300* :  It's equally possible that the voters, having delivered one punch to the president,
*03:57.300- 03:59.320* :  simply back it up with another.
*03:59.780- 04:04.280* :  Husco Field, well the impact of President Macron's decision has been felt in the country's
*04:04.280- 04:09.360* :  economic sector, with a euro dropping in value against the dollar and falls on French markets.
*04:09.800- 04:10.720* :  The Olegate reports.
*04:11.640- 04:16.380* :  Analysts say there appears that if he loses, a potentially difficult cohabitation between
*04:16.380- 04:21.220* :  the President and the Prime Minister representing his political opponents could undermine efforts
*04:21.220- 04:24.460* :  to reform the public finances and bring down the budget deficit.
*04:25.280- 04:28.560* :  The result has been a spike in the implied cost of government borrowing.
*04:29.160- 04:34.580* :  That in turn has hit chairs in major banks, with BNP Parabaugh falling more than 5% and
*04:35.020- 04:41.720* :  losing 7%. The uncertainty has also weighed on the value of the euro, which fell to a one-month
*04:41.720- 04:47.760* :  low against the US dollar. The Olegate. But the far-right didn't do so well in Eastern Europe.
*04:48.040- 04:52.980* :  Hungary's ruling party, led by Victor Orban, got its worst result in decades.
*04:53.680- 04:59.540* :  Bulgaria saw an abysmely low turnout for all parties, and the pro-EU Prime Minister of Poland,
*04:59.540- 05:06.120* :  Donald Tusk, managed to beat a populist anti-immigrant party that had ruled Poland until last year.
*05:06.820- 05:13.040* :  In Hungary, the real winner of the night was a former ally of Mr Orban's turned political foe.
*05:13.380- 05:16.320* :  Our reporter in Budapest, Nick Thorpe, told us more.
*05:17.120- 05:23.160* :  Victor Orban and his Fides party did come first, but they lost a million votes compared to two
*05:23.160- 05:29.160* :  years ago, the last parliamentary elections. And out of the blue, effectively, Peter Modja,
*05:29.160- 05:36.640* :  a former Fides insider, a lawyer, a former diplomat, set up a party three months ago, broke from
*05:36.640- 05:43.480* :  Fides and has been sharply criticising them across the country. He won an astonishing 30% of the vote
*05:43.880- 05:50.300* :  yesterday and has really taken over as the main challenger to Victor Orban and to Fides.
*05:50.860- 05:53.640* :  So, showing that Victor Orban is no longer invincible.
*05:54.120- 05:59.680* :  That's right, and I think this was important because the European Parliament this year was going to be
*05:59.680- 06:06.360* :  very important for Victor Orban. He's seen generally as a right-wing, a far-right leader,
*06:06.500- 06:13.060* :  and he was very much seeing himself as an ally of Georgia Malonean, Italy of Marine Le Pen in France.
*06:13.060- 06:17.760* :  And suddenly, though, just at this moment, when he thought he was going to be extremely
*06:17.760- 06:23.260* :  influential in Europe, he has seen in this result the carpet as it were being pulled out from
*06:23.260- 06:28.400* :  under his feet, so even though his party did best, they're in pretty big trouble here in Hungary.
*06:29.520- 06:34.080* :  And in Bulgaria, where there are parliamentary elections, as well as the European vote,
*06:35.000- 06:39.800* :  incredibly low turnout. Incredibly low turnout, but this is really because Bulgaria,
*06:40.760- 06:45.960* :  people are exhausted. This was the sixth parliamentary election in just three years,
*06:46.700- 06:53.360* :  and those leading parties there, Gabe, the central right, are party which actually came first.
*06:53.360- 06:59.780* :  Again, in this election, they have shown themselves unwilling or unable to collaborate
*06:59.780- 07:05.460* :  with the other main parties on the stage there. So, there's this sort of constant political
*07:05.460- 07:10.620* :  stalemate in Bulgaria, and one has the impression that the people of Bulgaria are sort of fed up
*07:10.620- 07:15.700* :  with voting and fed up with their politicians for failing to come out with a workable government.
*07:16.380- 07:21.740* :  And a very different picture in Poland, where the party of the pro-European Union Prime Minister
*07:21.740- 07:28.220* :  Donald Tusk did well. That's right, the civic coalition, they won 20 seats in the European Parliament,
*07:28.220- 07:35.420* :  to the right-wing law and justice party, which won also 20 seats. That's actually the first time
*07:35.420- 07:40.740* :  the Donald Tusk's civic coalition have actually beaten law and justice, but they're
*07:40.880- 07:45.320* :  then a good result for the centre right and for Donald Tusk in Poland, which is, I think,
*07:45.880- 07:50.420* :  one of the reasons why some in Europe are saying that the centre held on the day,
*07:50.420- 07:56.040* :  because Poland, obviously, a very influential country, the most influential of these Europeans.
*07:57.480- 08:02.060* :  Nick Thorpe and later in this podcast, will have some more analysis on why voters
*08:02.660- 08:09.100* :  backed far-right parties in such large numbers. Eight months into Israel's war in Gaza,
*08:09.100- 08:13.480* :  there is no end in sight. That prompted the former Defence Minister, a military chief,
*08:13.480- 08:18.200* :  Benny Gantz, to resign on Sunday from Israel's war cabinet, which was formed in the aftermath
*08:18.200- 08:23.640* :  of the Hamas attacks on October 7th. He accused the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*08:23.640- 08:29.140* :  of being more concerned about his political survival than the return of the hostages being held in
*08:29.140- 08:36.040* :  Gaza. The turmoil in Israeli politics comes as international anger is growing over the huge scale
*08:36.040- 08:43.180* :  of Palestinian casualties, with the US also voicing concern. It's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken,
*08:43.180- 08:48.660* :  is back in the region for his eighth Middle East tour since the war began. So how damaging
*08:48.660- 08:53.580* :  is Benny Gantz resignation for the Israeli Prime Minister? And what does it mean for his war
*08:53.580- 08:59.260* :  cabinet? Our correspondent in Jerusalem is John Donerson. This is significant, but it's not going
*08:59.260- 09:04.740* :  to bring down Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for the moment. It's significant
*09:04.740- 09:10.620* :  because Benny Gantz was a relatively moderate voice. He was someone with enormous military
*09:10.620- 09:16.600* :  experience and he was someone in particular who I think the Americans had a lot of respect for
*09:16.600- 09:21.900* :  and given that relations between Mr. Netanyahu and the Americans are so bad at the moment,
*09:21.900- 09:26.400* :  it was someone who the Americans felt they could talk to. That moderate voice has now gone.
*09:26.400- 09:31.780* :  I think the fear amongst Mr. Netanyahu's critics is that it could leave the way for more
*09:31.780- 09:37.900* :  extremist elements in the government and in particular itamar Ben Gavir, the security minister
*09:38.280- 09:43.420* :  to have a greater say and indeed he has said he should replace Mr. Gantz inside that war
*09:43.420- 09:49.400* :  cabinet. And Mr. Gantz, when he announced his resignation, he was very clear that the US was
*09:49.400- 09:56.380* :  not involved in this decision, but we now have Anthony Blinken visiting the Middle East again
*09:56.380- 10:01.300* :  the following day. What are we expecting from this latest visit by the US Secretary of State?
*10:02.360- 10:07.240* :  Well, Mr. Blinken is going to be putting pressure on both sides, both Hamas and the Israeli
*10:07.240- 10:13.540* :  government to accept this ceasefire plan. Now when it was announced, when it was announced by Joe
*10:13.540- 10:20.760* :  Biden, it was called an Israeli plan and Prime Minister Netanyahu has suggested he will go along
*10:20.760- 10:27.920* :  with it, even if reluctantly he said it was far from perfect. But as I say, there are people within
*10:27.920- 10:35.620* :  the government on the extreme right who have said they will pull out if any sort of ceasefire plan
*10:35.620- 10:41.120* :  is accepted for Gaza and that would be something that would bring the government down. So it's
*10:41.120- 10:48.220* :  something that Mr. Netanyahu has a difficult calculation to make. John Donerson in Jerusalem.
*10:49.420- 10:55.460* :  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi led a terrorist group which 10 years ago seized large areas of Iraq and Syria.
*10:55.460- 11:01.560* :  He called the group Islamic State and claimed to be a caliph, a claim almost universally rejected
*11:01.560- 11:07.240* :  by Muslims everywhere. During his reign of terror in Iraq, thousands of members of a long
*11:07.240- 11:13.360* :  persecuted minority called the Yazidis were killed or tortured. Many Yazidi women and girls were
*11:13.360- 11:19.180* :  kidnapped and forced to become sex slaves. Some survivors are attempting to sue the widow of the
*11:19.180- 11:26.280* :  Yaz leader Umadefa. She is accused of sex trafficking. Faraz Kilani of the BBC Arabic Service has
*11:31.320- 11:35.540* :  this report. Ten years ago, thousands of Yazidis fled across Northern Iraq.
*11:38.480- 11:45.860* :  Persecuted by the Islamic State, many were killed and more were kidnapped and taken as
*11:45.860- 11:53.120* :  six slaves. So I was one of them. Ten years on, we returned to the family home from where she was
*11:53.120- 12:00.080* :  abducted by IS fighters. There's no one left from my family, only me and my brother survived.
*12:01.080- 12:07.980* :  At the age of 14, she was taken captive and suffered use of sexual abuse. So I'd sister and
*12:07.980- 12:14.920* :  her uncle Hamid's daughter are still missing. Now they are determined to fight for justice,
*12:15.900- 12:22.620* :  for what happened to her and the family. The girls were kept at the home of IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Bardadi.
*12:23.200- 12:26.440* :  It's believed they were then sold as sex slaves.
*12:29.880- 12:32.900* :  We went to meet Al-Bardadi's widow Umadefa.
*12:33.260- 12:40.860* :  We are now being allowed into this prison in the Iraqi capital. She has been held here
*12:40.860- 12:48.060* :  for a few months on terrorism-related crimes. So I was taking her to court for her alleged
*12:48.060- 12:53.540* :  part in their ordeal. She admits that two missing girls did stay at her home.
*12:56.200- 13:01.880* :  At the time, I felt ashamed. How is it that women could be degraded to such an extent?
*13:02.620- 13:05.820* :  I was entirely against it, but I was a helpless woman.
*13:06.480- 13:13.500* :  So Adin says that Imhadefa is not innocent, and she must be confronted with her crimes.
*13:16.620- 13:22.500* :  It's Al-Bardadi's wife. She's a criminal like him. Where is my family? I can't find them.
*13:23.360- 13:27.680* :  Isn't it because of both of Al-Bardadi and her wife? I won't forgive her.
*13:28.460- 13:31.120* :  I will take my and other Yazidis girls revenge.
*13:32.520- 13:36.500* :  I asked Umadefa why she didn't help the girls escape.
*13:38.420- 13:41.680* :  I myself couldn't leave. How was I supposed to help her?
*13:42.380- 13:47.500* :  I don't deny that my husband was a criminal. I'm very sorry about what they went through,
*13:48.100- 13:51.300* :  but I wish they would know that I had absolutely nothing to do with this.
*13:54.980- 13:59.420* :  Abu Bakr Al-Bardadi led artists and extremists jihadist groups.
*14:01.920- 14:09.140* :  This brutal organization carried out crimes, including murder, torture, kidnapping, and slavery.
*14:11.740- 14:14.500* :  He was killed in a U.S. raid in 2019.
*14:16.780- 14:21.900* :  Umadefa says her husband was changed forever during detention at a U.S.
*14:21.900- 14:24.040* :  Trump prison in 2004.
*14:24.260- 14:30.320* :  I've always asked him about that change in his mental state.
*14:31.240- 14:35.420* :  And he used to tell me that he was exposed to something I could not understand.
*14:36.140- 14:39.480* :  I believe that he was subjected to sexual torture during his detention.
*14:39.740- 14:44.640* :  The Pentagon didn't reply to a request for a comment on her case.
*14:45.680- 14:49.100* :  Al-Bardadi's death didn't end the Yazidis' search for justice.
*14:49.820- 14:53.560* :  For money, the trauma continues. Thousands are still missing.
*14:54.860- 14:58.300* :  But so ad and her family could be heading towards justice.
*14:59.040- 15:02.000* :  And finally, have someone who may be held accountable.
*15:03.460- 15:05.560* :  That report by Faraz Kilani.
*15:06.660- 15:12.080* :  In April, the Nigerian film star, Junior Pope, was killed on his way back from a film set
*15:12.420- 15:14.680* :  when the boat he was traveling in capsized.
*15:15.380- 15:20.040* :  In the aftermath of his death, Hannah Gelbart from the BBC's What in the World podcast has
*15:20.040- 15:25.240* :  been speaking to actors and producers in Lagos about the safety record of the Nigerian film
*15:25.240- 15:29.800* :  industry known as Nollywood and whether something needs to change.
*15:34.660- 15:39.300* :  This is from a video recorded by the Nollywood actor Junior Pope the day before he died.
*15:39.920- 15:43.100* :  He's on a boat traveling fast and he's not wearing a life jacket.
*15:47.720- 15:51.420* :  The very next day, on his way back from a film set in a number of Nigeria,
*15:51.920- 15:55.220* :  the boat he was on capsized, killing him and four other people.
*15:56.040- 15:58.620* :  A safety investigation found multiple failures.
*15:59.200- 16:03.840* :  The boat wasn't registered, its driver had no license and only one passenger was wearing a
*16:03.840- 16:06.540* :  life jacket. That's because they brought it on board themselves.
*16:07.420- 16:11.480* :  But in a now deleted Instagram video, the producer of the film said she was told
*16:11.480- 16:15.500* :  there were life jackets and Junior Pope was offered one but didn't take it.
*16:16.060- 16:20.660* :  Actress and screenwriter Ruth Cadary was a friend of Pope's and she was shocked by his passing.
*16:21.040- 16:26.060* :  It was much more painful for me because I have been in that exact situation before
*16:27.040- 16:33.800* :  so I understood the fear, everything he must have felt at the last minute of his life.
*16:34.080- 16:38.640* :  Ruth had also been involved in a boat accident whilst making a movie and she can't swim.
*16:39.000- 16:43.820* :  I asked everybody, the team, if everything was okay they said yes, the canoe was fine.
*16:44.140- 16:48.180* :  So I got on the boat, action they said and then they started to paddle.
*16:48.420- 16:52.380* :  The canoe just tumbled into it. That's very big river.
*16:52.840- 16:55.300* :  She was saved by a colleague who grabbed her in the water.
*16:55.880- 16:57.260* :  Now she's calling for change.
*16:57.780- 17:03.620* :  I think there should be additional safety regulatory body that is included to production
*17:03.620- 17:07.080* :  sets. The director is thinking about creating the content.
*17:07.080- 17:09.720* :  The actor is thinking about getting in character.
*17:09.720- 17:14.040* :  The soul let us also just create an extra body, probably it's not going to cost so much
*17:14.380- 17:16.780* :  and he might just end up saving you a little stress.
*17:17.200- 17:20.920* :  The actor's guild of Nigeria posted a statement after Junior Pope's death,
*17:21.220- 17:26.000* :  saying it set up a special committee to look into improving safety guidelines and protocols.
*17:26.800- 17:31.440* :  Nollywood actor Cheedy DK says he has seen signs of improvement since the boat crash.
*17:31.880- 17:37.080* :  Safety record has been quite low, but right now it's better.
*17:37.600- 17:40.200* :  So I think the incident was a bit of a wake-up call to everybody.
*17:41.080- 17:45.480* :  So this is the director's act. Right now we act like we have to go back one more time,
*17:45.480- 17:47.580* :  come on now and that is important too.
*17:48.020- 17:50.840* :  Nollywood is the third largest film industry in the world.
*17:50.840- 17:56.180* :  After Hollywood and India's Bollywood and it publishes more than 2,500 films a year.
*17:56.700- 18:00.660* :  But this tragic incident has turned attention from what's happening in front of the camera
*18:01.120- 18:03.620* :  to some of the work practices going on behind it.
*18:04.400- 18:05.160* :  Hannah Gelbart.
*18:08.020- 18:09.200* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*18:09.200- 18:12.740* :  When we do surgery and we shine a special camera,
*18:13.500- 18:18.620* :  we can see the cancer cells light up during surgery with white light.
*18:19.380- 18:24.380* :  We hear how a fluorescent dye is helping scientists tackle cancer.
*18:33.080- 18:34.760* :  So how do we get AI right?
*18:35.240- 18:37.680* :  Well, we need the right volume of data,
*18:38.080- 18:42.520* :  the software to train it and massive compute power or...
*18:42.600- 18:43.960* :  Another one bites the dust.
*18:44.680- 18:45.160* :  Are you ready?
*18:45.160- 18:46.660* :  Hey, are you ready for this?
*18:46.920- 18:48.320* :  Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
*18:48.500- 18:53.280* :  But with HPE Green Lake, we get access to supercomputing to power AI at the scale we need,
*18:53.440- 18:54.900* :  helping generate better insights.
*18:55.260- 18:56.400* :  All right.

*19:39.120- 19:40.940* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast.
*19:41.800- 19:43.360* :  Japan has an age problem.
*19:43.360- 19:48.920* :  Nearly 30% of the population is 65 years old or even older.
*19:49.120- 19:50.560* :  The highest rate in the world.
*19:51.060- 19:53.880* :  And that figure is only expected to grow
*19:54.440- 19:58.600* :  as are the numbers of old people who live and die alone.
*19:59.140- 20:03.220* :  Authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to track down the families
*20:03.220- 20:05.220* :  of elderly people who pass away.
*20:05.840- 20:09.760* :  And even when they do, the red shifts sometimes refuse to collect their dead.
*20:10.000- 20:13.460* :  There are currently more than 60,000 unclaimed bodies
*20:13.460- 20:16.380* :  and the government is trying to find a way to deal with them.
*20:16.740- 20:20.400* :  Our correspondent in Tokyo, Shima Khalil, spoke to my colleague, Nick Miles.
*20:21.440- 20:25.780* :  Well, I think we're seeing the results of two overriding symptoms here in Japan.
*20:25.780- 20:30.720* :  One is the aging population, which shows itself in so many different facets,
*20:30.720- 20:33.440* :  whether it's the millions of empty homes, for example,
*20:33.440- 20:35.800* :  whether it's the problem with the workforce.
*20:35.800- 20:41.240* :  And now we're seeing many, many old people who die alone
*20:41.720- 20:43.500* :  and then their bodies are unclaimed.
*20:43.500- 20:47.740* :  You put that together with a society that is increasingly isolated and lonely.
*20:47.740- 20:50.320* :  And you get what the government is facing now,
*20:50.320- 20:53.820* :  what is known as lonely deaths or unrelated bodies.
*20:54.500- 20:57.220* :  And essentially, the authorities are trying to catch up with this issue,
*20:57.220- 21:00.820* :  with this problem, trying to not only see a way to tackle it,
*21:00.820- 21:03.080* :  but actually to find numbers.
*21:03.560- 21:06.760* :  So far, the police figures show that nearly 70,000 people,
*21:06.760- 21:11.280* :  so 68,000 people aged 65 and above die alone annually.
*21:11.540- 21:13.140* :  And this could be for a number of reasons.
*21:13.140- 21:15.740* :  But what you're seeing is an acute problem in urban areas.
*21:15.740- 21:18.280* :  So for example, where I am in Tokyo, it's different districts,
*21:18.280- 21:21.520* :  because it is more isolated, it is harsher,
*21:21.520- 21:26.180* :  and you get older people who live with very little contact with the outside world.
*21:26.600- 21:29.900* :  And as it stands, it's the responsibility of local authorities.
*21:29.900- 21:32.840* :  The current law stipulates that if a body is found,
*21:33.340- 21:35.780* :  the relatives cannot be traced or they can be traced,
*21:35.780- 21:38.040* :  but they refuse to take the body.
*21:38.040- 21:43.280* :  It is up to the local authorities to then cremate the body at their own discretion
*21:43.280- 21:45.080* :  and then store that.
*21:45.520- 21:51.420* :  But this law was put in place at a time when it was a very, very different landscape in Japan.
*21:51.420- 21:53.520* :  So the local authorities are going to the government saying,
*21:53.520- 21:56.520* :  look, we're being overwhelmed, we're under-resourced.
*21:56.760- 21:59.620* :  You need to do something about this to help us tackle this issue.
*21:59.840- 22:02.820* :  And so I'm briefly, and this is going to cost a lot of money
*22:02.820- 22:05.460* :  for these local authorities to have to track down the relatives.
*22:05.960- 22:09.640* :  And if they don't claim the bodies that deal with the dead body,
*22:10.340- 22:12.960* :  imagine people will be quite shocked that this is going on.
*22:12.960- 22:15.160* :  And Japan is a sort of shame that this is happening.
*22:15.840- 22:16.280* :  I think so.
*22:16.280- 22:19.720* :  I think that the whole society in general is waking up to the problem,
*22:19.720- 22:23.100* :  is waking up to the effect of what it means to live in an aging population.
*22:23.160- 22:27.540* :  And that's just one of the symptoms, especially if you're looking at something as delicate
*22:27.540- 22:31.800* :  and as sensitive as a decision on what to do with someone's remains
*22:31.800- 22:34.240* :  and how to get in touch with their contacts.
*22:34.240- 22:37.180* :  And also, Japan is looking at ways of, well,
*22:37.600- 22:42.080* :  if people are living longer and are lonely or what do you do
*22:42.080- 22:44.960* :  to keep in contact in an increasingly isolated society?
*22:45.840- 22:47.160* :  Shai Mikalil in Tokyo.
*22:47.980- 22:52.000* :  Scientists here in the UK have used fluorescent dye to help them identify
*22:52.000- 22:57.260* :  cancerous prostate cells during surgery that are invisible to the naked eye.
*22:57.800- 23:02.420* :  Using special imaging equipment, they were able to find and remove cancer cells,
*23:02.860- 23:04.600* :  which might otherwise have been left in the body.
*23:05.240- 23:08.380* :  Professor Freddie Hamdi is a lead author on the research.
*23:09.660- 23:15.020* :  We've developed without engineers here in Oxford, an optical platform, an imaging platform,
*23:15.020- 23:20.760* :  which uses fluorescence, dyes, combined with a very specific marker,
*23:21.420- 23:24.060* :  which will stick to the prostate cancer cells.
*23:24.680- 23:28.220* :  So when we do surgery and we shine a special camera,
*23:28.860- 23:34.000* :  inner patients received an injection of this dye with the marker, molecular marker,
*23:34.660- 23:39.800* :  we can see the cancer cells light up during surgery with white light.
*23:40.560- 23:44.300* :  The team at Oxford University hope the procedure, which is in early trials,
*23:44.300- 23:46.820* :  could reduce the chance of the disease returning.
*23:46.820- 23:49.380* :  Here's our health reporter, Orelia Foster.
*23:49.980- 23:53.660* :  Removing a prostate does not guarantee that all the cancer is gone,
*23:53.660- 23:58.120* :  often clusters of cells form in tissue or lymph nodes nearby,
*23:58.140- 24:00.360* :  and these can be difficult to spot.
*24:01.020- 24:07.120* :  In this early stage trial, the dye was injected into 23 men with the disease before their surgery.
*24:07.740- 24:12.300* :  Researchers say in many of the patients they found and removed cells that they would not have
*24:12.300- 24:18.660* :  seen without this technology. They say its use could also mean less damage is done to healthy tissue
*24:19.260- 24:24.820* :  and fewer side effects. Larger scaled trials are now underway to test how effective this is
*24:24.820- 24:27.740* :  compared with other methods. Orelia Foster.
*24:28.360- 24:32.280* :  The sound of the National Anthem, accompanied by the banging of pots and pans,
*24:32.280- 24:38.500* :  has been ringing through Venezuela's jails as inmates protest against alleged human rights abuses.
*24:39.300- 24:44.200* :  Many prisoners have also been staging a hunger strike in protest against the conditions
*24:44.200- 24:48.180* :  that they're held in. Our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia reports.
*24:58.220- 25:10.100* :  They're also complaining about governments in efficiency or negligence in processing their
*25:10.100- 25:15.480* :  release orders. The delays mean many prisoners have been forced to remain in jail after serving
*25:15.480- 25:20.220* :  their sentences. The protest comes six weeks ahead of next month's elections,
*25:20.720- 25:23.640* :  in which President Nicolás Maduro is seeking re-election.
*25:24.080- 25:28.920* :  The opposition has accused him of being complicit with criminal gangs that effectively control
*25:28.920- 25:34.240* :  life inside prisons. But last year his government launched a major offensive against the gangs,
*25:34.820- 25:39.980* :  deploying thousands of security forces in some of Venezuela's most notorious penetration.
*25:41.160- 25:47.160* :  Leonardo Russia. Malaysia is ending a blanket subsidy for diesel with prices for the fuel
*25:47.160- 25:53.320* :  expected to rise by 50 percent. But some groups including farmers and fishermen will still be
*25:53.320- 25:59.160* :  able to buy cheaper fuel. Mickey Pristay reports. Malaysia says this policy change
*25:59.160- 26:04.460* :  will lead to a reduction in smuggling. Previously subsidized diesel could be bought in Malaysia
*26:04.980- 26:10.120* :  and sold for a higher price in neighboring countries. That price differential will now close.
*26:10.940- 26:15.560* :  We've joined the subsidy will also save the Malaysian government nearly $1 billion a year.
*26:16.260- 26:20.440* :  What's more, increasing the price of diesel should cut demand for the fossil fuel,
*26:20.440- 26:26.620* :  reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, although it will mean higher prices for consumers.
*26:27.760- 26:32.720* :  Mickey Pristay. South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world.
*26:33.180- 26:37.720* :  Gay marriage is legal and it's against the law to discriminate against someone because of
*26:37.720- 26:43.420* :  their sexual orientation or gender identity. The only country in Africa where that's the case.
*26:44.280- 26:51.840* :  Despite this, hate crimes are common. Many people who identify as LGBTQ plus fear they could be
*26:51.840- 26:59.200* :  attacked or even murdered. The South African photographer Zanelli Maholi, who identifies as non-binary,
*26:59.680- 27:03.880* :  has one international acclaim for challenging discrimination in their homeland.
*27:04.620- 27:10.640* :  They're described as a visual activist. Vincent Dowd met them in London when exhibition of their work
*27:18.580- 27:24.860* :  has opened. Zanelli Maholi was born in a South African township in 1972, filmed revisiting that
*27:24.860- 27:31.640* :  world for a documentary. It's clearly a place they still enjoy. But even when young, Zanelli Maholi
*27:31.640- 27:38.320* :  knew those origins would be left behind. I grew up in Deben South in Omlazi, one of the townships.
*27:38.600- 27:45.120* :  I was raised by my mom who was a domestic worker who had to look after a children from a white
*27:45.180- 27:51.100* :  family. When I was young, I was not part of my career choice because I didn't have that privilege.
*27:51.720- 27:58.320* :  You were either a teacher or a nurse or doing some business course and I attended mostly
*27:58.320- 28:05.780* :  township schools and I wanted to become something or somebody in life and photography has become
*28:05.780- 28:13.120* :  that's part of space in which I speak. This was easy before. It's many lanes into my back.
*28:13.120- 28:20.100* :  The tape in London around 300 engaging and insightful portraits from a non-binary black South
*28:20.100- 28:26.760* :  African are attracting media attention. They're mainly in black and white and mostly they focus on
*28:26.760- 28:34.120* :  gay and trans South African lives, a theme identified early on. I noticed that there was a lack of
*28:34.120- 28:41.720* :  our visual voices. So speaking as an insider, I took it as my responsibility to continuously
*28:41.720- 28:49.400* :  document this community. There's this notion or wrong notion that says that to be homosexual
*28:49.400- 28:57.860* :  is an African. To be queer is a sin. People are being expelled from schools. Some people are being
*28:57.860- 29:03.460* :  rejected by own family members simply because of who we are.
*29:08.060- 29:15.420* :  Sannele Mouholy, it's always been a photograph of South Africa has been documenting queer
*29:15.420- 29:20.580* :  and trans people in that country for decades. In the middle point of the work of the South African
*29:21.180- 29:27.460* :  photographer and performance, Sannele Mouholy. Sannele Mouholy has built an international reputation
*29:27.460- 29:33.720* :  with thought-provoking portraits. A drank queen poses in a mini dress and red high heels.
*29:33.720- 29:40.860* :  On a beach in Durban, an elegant transgender woman poses in a bikini. But there are many defiantly
*29:40.860- 29:47.440* :  unglamorous pictures of gay and trans South Africans. At times, the model is the artist.
*29:47.960- 29:54.780* :  In one case, sporting an eye-catching headdress made of plastic and celebrating the memory of their
*29:54.780- 30:01.540* :  mother. It's called Besta. Besta is my mother's name and it speaks on women and work and I used
*30:01.540- 30:06.840* :  here fabric and then the pegs. These are washing pegs, like from a washing line. Definitely,
*30:06.840- 30:13.620* :  these are washing pegs from from the line. Just to bring forth how we could ten little objects
*30:13.620- 30:19.040* :  that could make the picture look so beautiful. It just gives that lighter feel to it.
*30:19.320- 30:24.840* :  But the exhibition at Tape Modern in London shows the artist is serious about being a visual
*30:24.840- 30:32.780* :  activist for their community. I am fighting for the visibility and the recognition of the Black
*30:32.780- 30:41.200* :  LGBTQIA+. Members from South Africa or Africa or around the world. It is very important for the
*30:41.200- 30:48.180* :  people to know that we exist, that there are people who identify like us who existed before
*30:48.600- 30:52.160* :  and people get to be known and most of all to be respected.
*30:53.240- 30:59.040* :  Zaneli Maholi speaking to Vincent Doud. Let's return now to our main story. The EU elections,
*30:59.040- 31:04.580* :  which have seen an overall shift to the right, including the far right. Many are asking who is
*31:04.580- 31:11.280* :  voting for the right and why. Sarah Holbolt is a professor in European politics at the London
*31:11.280- 31:17.320* :  School of Economics. She spoke to Sarah Montague. What we're seeing in some countries like France and
*31:17.320- 31:23.340* :  Germany is that younger voters are backing the radical right in the same number or perhaps even
*31:23.340- 31:29.240* :  larger numbers than older voters. For example, in France where the National Rally topped the pool,
*31:29.300- 31:34.680* :  they had a lead candidate, a very sort of young charismatic by della, and he's been very popular
*31:34.680- 31:40.080* :  with young voters. In Germany, we've also seen that the AfD, the radical right-wing AfD,
*31:40.080- 31:46.340* :  that had their best electoral results in their history coming in second, a popular amongst young
*31:46.340- 31:52.920* :  voters, especially a young man in Eastern Germany. It's not just young voters, of course, a vote
*31:52.920- 31:57.540* :  for these parties, but in some countries they are a significant proportion of their lectured.
*31:58.060- 32:02.120* :  But it's not everywhere, for example. The young voters in Italy are more likely to vote for
*32:02.220- 32:08.420* :  the left. The drive wherever it is and whatever age group it is voting right, what is driving that?
*32:08.420- 32:15.980* :  Is it immigration? Is it climate? Is it cultural identity politics? I mean, one of the key
*32:15.980- 32:22.500* :  drivers is, of course, a desire for change in terms of its grievances about what people are
*32:22.500- 32:27.260* :  facing in their everyday lives. This desire for change is something we often see amongst young
*32:27.260- 32:33.860* :  voters. And the radical right is very successful in using populist rhetoric to address people's grievances
*32:33.860- 32:39.740* :  about concerns they may have, about cost of living, could be lack of affordable housing or high
*32:39.740- 32:45.820* :  unemployment, and also linking that with the sort of cultural concerns you mention about immigration
*32:45.820- 32:51.980* :  and how society is changing, and promising them that they will have a better future with the
*32:51.980- 32:58.140* :  radical right, you know, in charge of pushing policies. Right, so the desire for change is not,
*32:58.140- 33:04.060* :  it's not a reactionary vote. Well, it's not reactionary in a sense that they want everything to
*33:04.060- 33:10.200* :  remain the same, but of course, under cultural issue, often there might be a nostalgia for a country
*33:10.200- 33:15.540* :  that is more powerful in the world, that's not changing in terms of its ethnic makeup. Because
*33:15.540- 33:21.580* :  one thing the radical right does have in common across Europe is very nativist rhetoric, often
*33:21.580- 33:27.680* :  wanting to reduce immigration, and even in some cases, like the German radical right, the AFD,
*33:27.680- 33:33.100* :  even wanting to deport immigrants. Is there a difference between the north and the south of Europe
*33:33.100- 33:38.940* :  with the north more likely to go left? And here we are in the UK, of course, expected to vote in
*33:38.940- 33:45.620* :  a centre-left government. Poland just recently moved back centre-left, and you mentioned Scandinavia
*33:46.100- 33:50.620* :  I think more what we're seeing is that the radical right really used to be concentrated in a few
*33:50.620- 33:54.640* :  countries, and what we're seeing now, there's almost no country in Europe that doesn't have
*33:54.900- 33:59.280* :  Britain being, of course, an exception, but also not voting in these elections, but not having a
*33:59.280- 34:03.180* :  radical right-wing party. So it's more kind of a uniform trend that we see these kind of
*34:03.240- 34:08.160* :  populist radical right parties also now in southern Europe where they used to be not as powerful.
*34:08.160- 34:13.600* :  So in that sense, we can't sort of see there's a north, south divide. However, there's a kind of
*34:13.600- 34:20.180* :  clear geographical divides within countries. People in cities, large cities tend to be less likely
*34:20.180- 34:25.020* :  to vote for the radical right. They gain more of their votes in towns and rural areas. Another
*34:25.020- 34:30.020* :  fact is education. We see that people who are higher educated, university educated are much
*34:30.020- 34:34.620* :  less likely to vote for the radical right. Sarah Holbolt from the London School of Economic

*35:12.480- 35:18.780* :  So, how do we get AI right? Well, we need the right volume of data, the software to train it
*35:19.100- 35:21.960* :  and massive compute power, or...
*35:22.380- 35:27.780* :  the dust. Are you ready? Are you ready for this? Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
