*01:20.800- 01:24.320* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.320- 01:30.240* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Sunday the 30th of June,
*01:30.240- 01:35.840* :  these are our main stories. The Iranian presidential election will go to a runoff on Friday
*01:35.840- 01:41.980* :  with the sole moderate candidate taking on an ultra conservative. Serbia's Prime Minister has
*01:41.980- 01:47.160* :  denounced a crossbow attack on a police officer guarding the Israeli embassy in Belgrade.
*01:49.900- 01:56.920* :  Also in this podcast, still my people in that comes, still there are many many sad stories
*01:56.920- 02:02.160* :  for door gals, still we have a thousand gals kidnapped by ISIS.
*02:02.640- 02:08.560* :  Members of a Yazidi choir remind the world of the crimes inflicted on them by the Islamic state group.
*02:13.360- 02:19.240* :  Despite a lack of enthusiasm from voters, the presidential election in Iran seems to have
*02:19.240- 02:25.660* :  produced an interesting outcome. A runoff between a moderate and a hardliner turnout was at a
*02:25.660- 02:32.760* :  historic low of about 40 percent down from 49 percent in 2021 when Ebrahim Risi was elected.
*02:33.340- 02:37.700* :  His death in a helicopter crash last month led to Friday's presidential vote,
*02:38.160- 02:43.660* :  the first since widespread protests over the death of Masa Aminni. The moderate candidate
*02:43.660- 02:50.100* :  Masoud Perseshkian got most votes about 42 percent not enough to win out right though. He will
*02:50.100- 02:56.380* :  face the far right former nuclear negotiator, Said Jalili, in the runoff this coming Friday.
*02:56.900- 03:01.920* :  C.A. Vash Adeland from the BBC's Persian Service has been monitoring the election,
*03:01.920- 03:06.760* :  so as hardliners like to keep control, can Masoud Perseshian win?
*03:07.480- 03:12.060* :  It all now depends on how the voters will behave in the second round of election.
*03:12.060- 03:16.600* :  You have a polarized society where the majority have decided not to vote,
*03:17.120- 03:20.760* :  delivering a very strong message to the clerical establishment. We don't want you.
*03:21.400- 03:26.000* :  And then you have the regime loyalists who have also become radicalized in their own way,
*03:26.000- 03:29.180* :  who have decided to choose the far right candidate, Said Jalili,
*03:29.180- 03:34.700* :  against Muhammad Bukhari Bof was considered the center right candidate, the previous mayor of Iran,
*03:34.700- 03:41.680* :  who was in favor of relations with the West, but at the same time thought that sanction was a huge issue.
*03:42.040- 03:47.200* :  Now in the second round of elections, whether that's 13 percent that the supporters of Kali Bof took,
*03:47.700- 03:52.160* :  whether who they will vote for, will they decide to vote for the hardline candidate,
*03:52.160- 03:57.880* :  or will they go with the pro-reform moderate Perseshkian, and whether those election bycorders,
*03:57.880- 04:03.240* :  those who chose not to vote and deliver this powerful no message to the clerical establishment,
*04:03.240- 04:09.360* :  will they see no difference between the victory of a hardline president or a pro-reform moderate
*04:09.360- 04:16.160* :  president? Yeah, it was quite a polarizing choice from what you say, and given how low turnout was
*04:16.160- 04:22.320* :  in this first round, what do you think for the second round? It really depends on how things
*04:22.600- 04:27.260* :  play out. People are pretty dissatisfied with the regime, especially after that brutal
*04:27.260- 04:32.160* :  repression of the protests that took place over the mandatory hijab, and the fact that the regime
*04:32.160- 04:38.140* :  has doubled down on a lot of those restrictions as well. So the people are pretty much dissatisfied,
*04:38.140- 04:44.500* :  whether they think there is a difference between who becomes president, whether they're considered,
*04:44.880- 04:49.080* :  because the message of the boycorders has always been, there's no difference between these two. They
*04:49.080- 04:53.860* :  really represent the same regime, the same establishment. There won't be any major changes,
*04:54.380- 04:59.280* :  whereas in fact, it does make a huge difference who the president will be in terms of the direction
*04:59.280- 05:05.320* :  of the country, but it's really up to those people, and also those small minority who voted for
*05:05.320- 05:10.500* :  the center-right candidate, Gaudi-Bulf, whether they decide to vote for a moderate or a far-right
*05:10.500- 05:14.920* :  candidate. Yeah, well, tell us what difference it would make, because after all the Supreme Leader
*05:14.920- 05:21.980* :  still retains on his authority. Absolutely. He has the final say in all matters relating to foreign
*05:21.980- 05:28.420* :  policy, but the difference is that the moderate president wants to open up to the West, wants to strike
*05:28.420- 05:33.620* :  a deal with the West over Iran's nuclear activities, wants to remove sanctions, and he considers
*05:34.140- 05:41.140* :  sanctions as the key to Iran's economic progress, whereas the far-right candidate doesn't even think
*05:41.140- 05:45.900* :  sanctions as a problem. He thinks sanctions is an opportunity, if not a blessing, and he thinks the
*05:45.900- 05:52.660* :  country has enough potential through its alliances with China and the West to become a powerhouse
*05:52.660- 06:00.200* :  on its own terms. C.A.V.A.S.H.A.R.D.A.L.N. talking to Oliver Conway. Professor Saeed Mohamed Morandi is a
*06:00.200- 06:06.220* :  political analyst based at the University of Tehran and a government loyalist. Paul Henley put it
*06:06.220- 06:11.820* :  to him that a particularly low turnout in the first round of these elections would be seen as a
*06:11.820- 06:20.200* :  lack of faith in the Iranian system. No, because if we look back to the funerals of President
*06:21.460- 06:27.500* :  40 days ago that took place in multiple cities, we saw that millions of people came to the streets
*06:27.500- 06:32.840* :  and the city of Tabriz, for example, where the turnout was for the election was low,
*06:33.560- 06:40.360* :  the numbers that came to the funeral were much higher. So I don't think it's reflective of any
*06:41.060- 06:47.820* :  lack of support for the Islamic Republic of Iran, but I think it does show that none of the
*06:47.820- 06:53.960* :  candidates were exceptionally attractive. So the election does seem to have quite a clear
*06:53.960- 07:01.800* :  result, at least in the first round, and the leader is a so-called reformist. How might things
*07:01.800- 07:08.540* :  change in Iran were he to take power? He is clearly from the Reformist camp. He's a moderate
*07:08.540- 07:14.720* :  reformist. He was one of the three people who the Reformist camp put forward as they're
*07:15.000- 07:21.760* :  candidate from the very start. He has a strong chance of being elected. I think it will depend
*07:21.920- 07:27.880* :  on his performance in the upcoming debate. So far from what we've seen in the previous debates,
*07:27.880- 07:33.220* :  we had 20 hours of debates between the different candidates and hundreds of hours of each of the
*07:33.220- 07:39.920* :  candidates being on public television. So far no one stood out and no one was particularly charismatic.
*07:40.420- 07:45.020* :  And that's why the vote was divided, and that's also why the turnout wasn't high. It was
*07:45.020- 07:50.140* :  pretty low. But since there will only be two candidates now, I think that there will be a greater
*07:50.140- 07:54.800* :  chance for them to express their views and for people to make a decision.
*07:55.400- 08:01.040* :  I suppose I called Masoud Pezashkian a so-called reformist because of court. He is part of
*08:01.040- 08:05.800* :  the establishment, even though he's proposing some changes. There are sociologists in Iran
*08:05.800- 08:12.360* :  who say that no leader from the current system will be able to show the transformation of
*08:12.360- 08:17.980* :  society in Iran in recent times. Clearly, that's something you disagree with.
*08:18.600- 08:24.680* :  Well, I think you would find sociologists in the UK who would be saying the same thing about
*08:24.680- 08:30.460* :  the United Kingdom. But the fact is that the United Kingdom has elections and people will be
*08:30.460- 08:39.280* :  elected from labor or conservative or now new forces that are at play. And your government will
*08:39.280- 08:44.880* :  continue to function. And my doubt that the BBC will call it illegitimate. So I think that it's
*08:44.880- 08:51.860* :  quite clear that you have very different political views in the political establishment in Iran.
*08:52.540- 08:59.000* :  And they make their case on television and different people are elected. And the state will
*08:59.000- 09:04.880* :  continue to function. And as I said before, the notion that the Islamic Republic of Iran does not
*09:04.880- 09:12.620* :  have popular legitimacy is not very sensible. Professor Sayed Mohamed Mirandi from the University of
*09:12.620- 09:19.640* :  Tehran. The Serbian Prime Minister, me-losh Vuchovich, has described a cross-pertak on a police
*09:19.640- 09:25.500* :  officer guarding Israel's embassy in Belgrade on Saturday as a heinous terrorist attack.
*09:25.500- 09:29.320* :  Security has been increased throughout Belgrade, Guadalune reports.
*09:30.260- 09:34.240* :  Serbia's Interior Minister had suggested that people connected to the Wahabi movement
*09:34.240- 09:39.220* :  might have been involved in the attack at Israel's embassy in Belgrade. But Prime Minister Miloš
*09:39.220- 09:44.060* :  Vuchovich appears to be downplaying that possibility. He called the Crossbow attack on a police
*09:44.060- 09:49.620* :  officer on duty at the embassy a heinous terrorist attack. But he described it as the crime of an
*09:49.620- 09:54.740* :  individual. Mr. Vuchovich urged people to remain calm and not succumb to propaganda
*09:54.740- 10:00.620* :  that might encourage hate crimes. The police officer is recovering in hospital. He shot dead,
*10:00.620- 10:05.420* :  his attacker. The authorities said that was in self-defense, Guadalune.
*10:06.260- 10:12.100* :  The Taliban in Afghanistan have ruled out discussing women's rights at UN-led talks taking
*10:12.100- 10:17.760* :  place today in Qatar and repeated its view that the issue is an internal Afghan matter.
*10:17.760- 10:23.460* :  Human rights groups have condemned the Taliban for, among other things, crushing women's access
*10:23.460- 10:28.940* :  to work and education since they returned to power almost three years ago, more from our South
*10:28.940- 10:35.340* :  Asia regional editor and barathon at a Russian. It's going to be a two-day meeting in Doha,
*10:35.340- 10:41.100* :  in which invoice from more than 25 countries will be attending this meeting. And broadly,
*10:41.100- 10:47.200* :  this is described as engagement with the de facto Afghan rulers, the Taliban group.
*10:47.740- 10:53.720* :  Since they seized power in August 2021, in the Taliban, they are literally in control of the
*10:53.720- 10:59.800* :  whole country. But there are issues like women's rights and preventing women from going to secondary
*10:59.800- 11:05.720* :  school and also to most workplaces and many human rights groups have criticized. So there are
*11:06.220- 11:11.240* :  lots of issues to discuss with the Taliban, but this is being described as something where they
*11:11.240- 11:16.420* :  want to engage with the Taliban. But this meeting is not without criticism.
*11:16.840- 11:23.620* :  Yeah, and the Taliban have insisted that the fate of women in Afghan society is not
*11:23.620- 11:29.220* :  up for discussion. They have made it very clear in a press conference today that Chief Spok's
*11:29.220- 11:36.500* :  person, Zabi Hula Mujahid, he will be leading a delegation to Doha and he said the women's rights
*11:36.500- 11:43.020* :  issue is an Afghan problem, Afghan issue. So we will discuss it among ourself within Afghanistan
*11:43.760- 11:49.000* :  and we don't discuss domestic matters in this meeting. So basically, they are ruling out discussing
*11:49.000- 11:56.340* :  these issues. So they are not allowing the UN or any other international agency to re-open schools
*11:56.380- 12:01.880* :  or help them with the schools, but on the other hand, you know, two-thirds of Afghan population.
*12:02.020- 12:07.820* :  We are talking about 30 million people. They need humanitarian assistance. You know, after the war,
*12:07.820- 12:13.980* :  you know, there was a lot of sanctions, many businesses were leaving the country. So people
*12:13.980- 12:19.260* :  are returning from countries like Pakistan and Iran. These those governments are forcing Afghans to
*12:19.260- 12:24.560* :  go back to their country. So the country is facing a very difficult economic situation. So the UN
*12:25.140- 12:30.500* :  needs to deal with the Taliban. That is the current reality and that is what they are accepting.
*12:30.500- 12:37.120* :  So we need to engage to exchange views at the same time. They also want to convey the message to
*12:37.120- 12:43.400* :  the Taliban that unless you are going to address these rights concerns, then the international
*12:43.400- 12:48.720* :  community's recognition will not happen. And the money of Afghanistan, which is still lying with
*12:48.720- 12:53.700* :  many of the Western capitals, it won't be released unless some of these conditions were met.
*12:53.700- 12:59.580* :  This has been the consistent message. So very briefly, Abbas. Are there any reasons for women
*12:59.580- 13:04.720* :  to feel hopeful? Every day, we are getting reports of, you know, those women who have been
*13:04.720- 13:10.400* :  protesting for rights, they are being jailed, they are being abused by Taliban. These were the
*13:10.400- 13:16.940* :  allegations which the Taliban, they deny. And women are largely excluded from public life. They
*13:16.940- 13:23.680* :  cannot go to places like in Jim or public path. Most workplaces are out of bounds. Universities,
*13:23.680- 13:29.000* :  they are banned from education. So their future is a big, big question mark.
*13:29.600- 13:35.620* :  And Barassan et Erosion. To highlight the plight of their traumatized community, eight members
*13:35.620- 13:41.220* :  of Yazidi women's choir have been performing in London this week. Caroline Hawley went to meet
*13:41.220- 13:45.680* :  them and a warning her report contains graphic descriptions of violence.
*13:53.180- 13:57.440* :  They sing together to showcase their culture and they know too that music can heal.
*13:58.320- 14:03.280* :  Their people have suffered an unimaginable collective ordeal and the pain is still raw.
*14:03.700- 14:09.800* :  My name is Amirah. I am from Iraq. I was in ginger. I live in Hanki.
*14:10.600- 14:14.180* :  Amirah managed to escape IS fighters by fleeing up the mountainside.
*14:14.900- 14:19.800* :  But tears roll silently down her cheeks as she tells me what happened to her two older sisters
*14:20.280- 14:23.760* :  who were both taken as slaves. Because they were mothers, they weren't raped,
*14:24.400- 14:26.560* :  but there were beatings and gruesome threats.
*14:31.680- 14:38.160* :  My sister gave birth 15 days before she was captured. And IS said to her, we will kill your baby
*14:38.480- 14:39.940* :  and force you to eat his flesh.
*14:44.940- 14:50.660* :  This was Vyanda Kheel, Iraq's only Yazidi politician, making a desperate appeal in the country's
*14:50.700- 14:57.020* :  parliament back in August 2014 saying her people were being slaughtered. She begged for help to save
*14:57.020- 15:08.200* :  them during global attention. And can I ask why looking back at that rings tears to your eyes now?
*15:08.860- 15:14.320* :  Of course, the fact that the Soviet is not finished, still my people in the camps,
*15:15.020- 15:19.760* :  still there are many, many sad stories for those girls.
*15:21.100- 15:24.980* :  Still we have a thousand. Girls kidnapped by ISIS.
*15:25.640- 15:30.200* :  She says many young women are still unaccounted for, and the Yazidis feel abandoned.
*15:31.060- 15:35.640* :  The Iraqi government wants to close the camps where they live. Life intends is tough,
*15:35.640- 15:41.380* :  but many Yazidis are scared to go back to Sinja, their homes are gone, and they say there's not much
*15:41.380- 15:42.680* :  but rubble to return to.
*15:43.040- 15:49.920* :  The situation is very dangerous in Sinja, because there are many armed groups in Sinja like PKK
*15:49.920- 15:59.100* :  and Haja Shabi and other groups. The Iraqi army is very weak in Sinja. This is the first.
*15:59.200- 16:05.900* :  The second, there are no anything, no belting, no houses, no schools, no hospitals.
*16:11.580- 16:14.920* :  And the office manager of Omar Foundation in the Hague.
*16:15.120- 16:20.260* :  The Omar Foundation is a charity which supports Yazidi women with music lessons and healthcare clinics.
*16:21.240- 16:25.460* :  It brought the choir to perform in the UK to raise awareness of the Yazidis plight.
*16:25.680- 16:31.940* :  There are still too many Yazidi girls who are still in captivity and no one is asking for them.
*16:31.940- 16:38.220* :  Iraqi government doesn't care about them. There are too many ISIS fighters who have been released
*16:44.820- 16:44.880* :  from the prisons.
*16:44.880- 16:48.060* :  This is Haredia singing about the persecution of her people.
*16:48.860- 16:53.380* :  In her mind is her cousin Hazal, captured by IS when she was just eight years old.
*16:54.160- 16:58.480* :  By the time Kurdish forces rescued her, she'd been married off and had two children
*16:58.480- 17:04.140* :  who she had to leave behind as she was freed. It's hard to imagine the trauma this community
*17:04.580- 17:09.440* :  has endured, but the women are determined to raise their voices. They want to celebrate their
*17:09.500- 17:14.720* :  identity and as they deal with their collective pain, they ask the world not to forget.
*17:19.640- 17:21.800* :  That report by Caroline Hawley.
*17:24.620- 17:28.120* :  Still to come. New revelations on how the rich and the powerful
*17:28.120- 17:30.280* :  hide cash are rocking countries around the world.
*17:48.640- 17:53.940* :  Cool fact, a crocodile can't stick out its tongue. Also, you can get health insurance for a month
*17:53.940- 17:57.580* :  or just under a year in some states. United healthcare short term insurance plans
*17:57.580- 18:01.700* :  underwritten by Golden Roll Insurance Company offer flexible budget-friendly coverage for you.

*18:03.660- 18:08.280* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, IS Mint Mobile's legal team, if big wireless companies are
*18:08.280- 18:12.900* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation, they said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*18:12.900- 18:16.380* :  prices technically violates those honorists to your contracts, they said,
*18:16.380- 18:19.960* :  what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hawley with s**t.
*18:20.060- 18:25.420* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*18:25.560- 18:28.120* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com-switch.
*18:38.480- 18:43.700* :  Only of this month, Narendra Modi was reelected Prime Minister of India for a third time,
*18:43.700- 18:49.460* :  but with a much smaller mandate after his governing party, the BJP failed to win enough seats
*18:49.460- 18:55.600* :  for an outright majority. This is uncharted territory for Mr Modi, who is running a coalition
*18:55.600- 19:03.280* :  government. What does what's been called Modi 3.0 mean for the country? The BBC's South Asia
*19:03.280- 19:06.260* :  Correspondence Samira Hasein reports from Delhi.
*19:11.380- 19:15.760* :  A rock is beginning to a new session of parliament, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi
*19:15.760- 19:18.160* :  walks towards the podium to take his oath.
*19:27.180- 19:31.560* :  Members of the opposition, well they're holding up copies of India's constitution.
*19:31.820- 19:36.400* :  It's a jive at the Prime Minister by the opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi,
*19:36.780- 19:39.160* :  he's the leader of the Indian National Congress.
*19:45.820- 19:50.260* :  The attack that the Prime Minister is launching on the constitution is not acceptable to us.
*19:50.540- 19:51.920* :  We will not let this happen.
*19:55.820- 20:01.460* :  If day one is anything to go by, this new session of parliament will likely be a combative one.
*20:02.420- 20:07.440* :  I've come to the centre for developing societies to speak with Sanjay Kumar and he is a political
*20:07.440- 20:13.280* :  analyst. What are some of the issues that are really going to test Prime Minister Modi and
*20:13.280- 20:18.500* :  this coalition government? The UCC, Uniform Civil Code, that's on the agenda of the BJP.
*20:18.660- 20:22.960* :  It was on the agenda of the BJP. It is not going to be easy for the government now
*20:23.460- 20:26.300* :  to take such bold decision, take it forward.
*20:27.040- 20:32.260* :  The UCC is a set of laws that would replace the option for Indians of specific religious groups
*20:32.780- 20:35.240* :  to follow rules based on that faith group.
*20:35.780- 20:39.480* :  Muslims see it as the government trying to put limitations on religious freedoms.
*20:41.200- 20:46.040* :  And it's part of the reason why a proven and chaat, a professor of Hindi literature at Delhi University,
*20:46.040- 20:49.420* :  believes Mr. Modi will continue with the politics of divide.
*20:49.420- 20:52.960* :  What do you expect from this government?
*20:53.560- 21:00.460* :  He will remain an authoritarian person and he has now exposed himself fully in last three months
*21:00.460- 21:05.260* :  that his anti-Muslim politics is what gives him life.
*21:05.540- 21:11.300* :  So I think those policies will continue. The policies which marginalize, isolate, corner,
*21:11.300- 21:19.020* :  Muslims, take away their rights by enacting laws, by executive orders, by political decisions,
*21:19.680- 21:25.740* :  and by unleashing violence, by organized groups. So that is going to continue.
*21:26.440- 21:28.500* :  And the residents there are outtricks.
*21:28.560- 21:33.740* :  Yeah, they are at Gharupar Chalgaya. We are looking at residents in that complex, very upset with
*21:33.740- 21:35.960* :  the fact that that Muslim movement was awarded that apartment.
*21:36.100- 21:40.840* :  Homes of Muslim families, bulldozed, mobs attacking Muslims believe to be slaughtering cows,
*21:41.560- 21:43.980* :  examples a provenant says proves his point.
*21:46.600- 21:51.280* :  Mr. Modi and the BJP have repeatedly rejected claims that they are anti-Muslim.
*21:54.760- 21:59.640* :  Speaking to reporters outside parliament, the Prime Minister said he will serve his country
*21:59.640- 22:05.980* :  and fulfill the hopes and aspirations of everyone in India, all 1.4 billion people.
*22:09.480- 22:15.660* :  Samira Hussain, 11 German police officers were injured on Saturday during clashes with
*22:15.660- 22:21.220* :  protesters who attempted to disrupt a conference of the far right alternative for Germany party.
*22:21.220- 22:26.660* :  Police say they used pepper spray and batons when one group of demonstrators tried to breach
*22:26.660- 22:32.180* :  a roadblock near the venue in the western city of Essen. Several arrests were made.
*22:32.180- 22:38.360* :  The AFD party said it would not be intimidated. You are at regional editor Danny Aberhardt reports.
*22:44.460- 22:47.620* :  There have at times been scuffles and violence in Essen.
*22:48.220- 22:52.320* :  Police collashed with anti-fascist protesters, some of whom had their faces covered.
*22:52.520- 23:01.420* :  Nazi pigs shouted demonstrators at some AFD delegates who needed a police escort to
*23:01.420- 23:06.640* :  reach the venue. The police say two officers were kicked in the head during one such operation,
*23:07.320- 23:10.380* :  but many of the tens of thousands of demonstrators protested peacefully.
*23:11.020- 23:16.280* :  They accused the AFD of spreading hate, polarising society with their anti-immigrant anti-Islam
*23:16.280- 23:22.360* :  and deeply eurosceptic positions. The AFD counters its policies are about reasserting sovereignty.
*23:27.940- 23:33.620* :  The co-leader of the AFD, Elise Vidal, told the conference the scenes outside had nothing to do
*23:33.620- 23:38.760* :  with democracy. The party wants to build on its relative success in recent European parliamentary
*23:38.760- 23:45.080* :  elections. It came second in Germany. That was despite the AFD having been expelled from a far
*23:45.080- 23:49.640* :  right grouping in the European Parliament, after its lead candidates said not all members of
*23:49.640- 23:54.240* :  the Nazi paramilitary SS were war criminals. Danny Aberhardt
*23:55.100- 24:01.020* :  For many, the end of June marks the end of Pride, a month dedicated to celebrating LGBTQ
*24:01.020- 24:07.420* :  plus communities across the world. However, Saturday's parade in Paris took place in the shadow
*24:07.420- 24:13.940* :  of France's snap parliamentary election, with the far-right National Rally party hoping to capitalise
*24:13.940- 24:20.540* :  on their victory in this month's European Parliament elections. Increasing anti-LGBT sentiment
*24:20.540- 24:26.520* :  and violence, of course, the French government to call for extra security at this weekend's events
*24:26.520- 24:35.600* :  Ella Bickner reports. Half a million people flooded the streets of Paris for the annual Marche
*24:35.600- 24:41.800* :  de fiette LJBt, one of the world's longest running Pride marches. There's always a colorful affair,
*24:42.000- 24:46.000* :  a celebration completed with floats, bright colours and elaborate costumes,
*24:46.000- 24:52.480* :  but in the wake of rising anti-LGBTQ sentiment across France and a snap parliamentary election
*24:52.480- 24:56.240* :  around the corner, those taking part feel there's a lot at stake.
*25:03.220- 25:07.020* :  Government statistics released this week show hate crimes against people based on
*25:07.020- 25:12.040* :  sexual orientation in France have jumped by 13% in the last two years alone.
*25:12.140- 25:17.800* :  It's why Interior Minister Jérale Daminal wrote to police and local authorities asking them
*25:17.800- 25:23.920* :  to step up their security measures this month. Activists like James Lapellier say it's a worrying trend,
*25:23.960- 25:28.060* :  made worse by the growing support for the far-right National Rally party.
*25:28.680- 25:40.720* :  We want to vote against the extreme right and four parties which prioritise our right,
*25:40.720- 25:47.380* :  our demands, because we know that the rights of minorities would be the first victims if they
*25:47.860- 25:48.500* :  came to power.
*25:48.500- 25:52.260* :  These political parties are the minorities.
*25:52.880- 25:57.600* :  Support for the party and its policies have grown from strength to strength in recent years.
*25:58.160- 26:02.820* :  It's victory as France's leading party in the EU parliamentary elections this month
*26:03.100- 26:08.440* :  caused a defeat at President Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call a snap election.
*26:09.000- 26:13.560* :  The first round of voting kicks off on Sunday, with one poll suggesting that the National Rally
*26:13.560- 26:19.060* :  will win a historic majority. The parties voted against legislation that gives more rights to
*26:19.740- 26:25.080* :  LGBTQ plus groups, including marriage equality, same-sex adoption and same-sex surrogacy.
*26:25.760- 26:29.880* :  Although the National Rally did not comment when asked about hate crimes following the European
*26:29.880- 26:34.860* :  Parliament elections, it maintains no links to violent far-right groups.
*26:35.420- 26:42.320* :  Ella Bicknell. Finally, remember the Panama Papers which exposed how tax havens were allegedly
*26:42.320- 26:48.120* :  used to hide money. The publications pointed the finger at leaders and celebrities around the world.
*26:48.120- 26:53.720* :  But now, a court in Panama has acquitted all 28 people charged with money laundering.
*26:54.200- 26:55.540* :  Rachel Reich has this report.
*26:56.460- 27:00.740* :  New revelations on how the rich and the powerful hide cash or rocking countries around the world
*27:00.740- 27:07.400* :  the so-called Panama Papers contain Alex. It was a huge story when in 2016 11 and a half million
*27:07.400- 27:13.000* :  documents were taken from a former Panamanium offshore law firm and corporate service provider
*27:13.360- 27:18.000* :  Mossack-Fonseca. They found themselves at the centre of a massive storm.
*27:18.520- 27:26.840* :  Tell him that a group of around 20 or 25 international journalists is in front of your building.
*27:27.460- 27:32.500* :  The documents contained personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public
*27:32.500- 27:37.480* :  officials that have previously been kept private. An anonymous whistleblower leaked the documents
*27:37.480- 27:43.060* :  to a German newspaper which asked the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists for help.
*27:43.100- 27:48.560* :  Will Fitzgibbon from the ICIJ spoke on the day they published the Panama Papers.
*27:49.080- 27:54.580* :  I think really the story is about a system that is not meeting the expectations of
*27:54.580- 27:58.980* :  governments and regulators and is not meeting the standards of the majority of the world's
*27:59.200- 28:04.600* :  population who have to live by rules that don't allow them to really write to a company and ask
*28:04.600- 28:09.060* :  how they can form an offshore entity that will enable them to pay less tax.
*28:09.600- 28:14.700* :  But the papers did name individual heads of state and government and senior figures for almost
*28:14.700- 28:20.280* :  every country in the world. Among them Iceland's Prime Minister, Sigmund Ehrgund Laogson,
*28:20.280- 28:24.860* :  who was asked by journalists from the National Broadcaster about his tax affairs.
*28:27.740- 28:33.220* :  And then promptly walked out of the interview with thousands of people protesting on the streets
*28:33.220- 28:38.520* :  of Reykjavik. He was forced to resign. In total, the data revealed links to 12
*28:38.520- 28:43.520* :  current or former heads of state and government, including dictators accused of embezzling money
*28:43.520- 28:49.640* :  from their own countries. The Argentine football star, Leonor Messi, Spanish filmmaker Pedro
*28:49.640- 28:56.120* :  Almoldova, were also named. In an interview shortly after the expose broke, Mr. Fonseca,
*28:56.120- 29:00.620* :  the co-founder of the law firm, said they had carefully vetted their clients,
*29:00.620- 29:05.700* :  but that they were similar to a car factory and that they are not responsible for what is done
*29:05.700- 29:12.560* :  with the car after it's sold. But, under new laws passed by Panama against tax fraud and money
*29:12.560- 29:17.360* :  laundering, a trial against 29 defendants went ahead in April of this year.
*29:20.960- 29:25.960* :  Among the 29 defendants were the law firm's co-founders, one of whom Reyman Fonseca
*29:26.300- 29:31.920* :  died in May while awaiting the verdict. Prosecutors alleged that Mossack Fonseca had created
*29:31.920- 29:37.920* :  shell companies with the purpose of hiding money and inelicit activities, and that the firm failed
*29:37.920- 29:43.220* :  to act with due diligence, but the judge said they didn't provide sufficient evidence in the
*29:43.220- 29:47.500* :  10-day trial and acquitted all the defendants. Rachel Wright.
*29:50.680- 29:56.840* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
