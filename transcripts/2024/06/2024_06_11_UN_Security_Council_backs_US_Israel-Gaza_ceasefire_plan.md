*01:18.840- 01:22.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.880- 01:31.200* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 11th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:31.880- 01:36.380* :  The United Nations Security Council has voted in favor of an American resolution
*01:36.380- 01:40.620* :  calling for an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
*01:41.240- 01:44.200* :  An aircraft carrying Malawi's Vice President has gone missing.
*01:44.220- 01:50.000* :  Poland says it's planning to reintroduce a no-go zone on its border with Biela Rousse
*01:50.300- 01:53.060* :  days after a Polish soldier was stabbed to death.
*01:55.560- 01:56.940* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:57.580- 02:01.900* :  We could see phones creeping in, actually, with nine year olds and ten year olds, you know,
*02:02.260- 02:07.620* :  and the children started going on WhatsApp, you know, and we were as teachers dealing with kids being left
*02:07.620- 02:09.580* :  out used or kids being obsessed.
*02:10.060- 02:15.140* :  We hear from the teachers of the primary schools in one Irish town that are asking
*02:15.140- 02:21.160* :  parents to delay buying their children's smartphones because of fears they may bring on anxiety.
*02:25.300- 02:29.080* :  We begin at the United Nations Security Council in New York.
*02:29.640- 02:34.020* :  Will those in favor of the draft resolution please raise their hand?
*02:36.560- 02:39.520* :  Those against abstentions.
*02:42.180- 02:44.420* :  The results of the voting is as follows.
*02:45.120- 02:50.380* :  Fourteen votes in favor, zero votes against one abstention.
*02:52.320- 02:57.240* :  The draft resolution has been adopted as resolution 2735.
*02:57.960- 03:02.520* :  Could this be the vote that brings a ceasefire in the war in Gaza Closer?
*03:02.720- 03:06.680* :  The resolution proposed by the United States called for an immediate full and
*03:06.680- 03:09.420* :  complete ceasefire by Israel and Hamas.
*03:09.880- 03:10.960* :  Russia abstained.
*03:11.360- 03:15.880* :  Speaking after the vote, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Linda Tobus Greenfield,
*03:16.200- 03:21.360* :  said the fighting in Gaza could end now if Hamas accepted the three-phase plan
*03:21.360- 03:26.900* :  early as she called on both sides to implement the deal without delay and without condition.
*03:27.360- 03:29.700* :  The ambassador said all sides would benefit.
*03:30.400- 03:35.640* :  This deal would bring hostage's home, insurer Israel's security,
*03:36.920- 03:42.820* :  enable a surge of humanitarian relief and essential services including water and electricity,
*03:43.660- 03:49.180* :  medical facilities and rubble removal to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
*03:49.680- 03:54.480* :  Within minutes of the vote, Hamas issued a statement saying it welcomed it and the Palestinian
*03:54.480- 03:58.340* :  ambassador to the UN, Riyadh Mansur, had this to say.
*03:58.640- 04:06.060* :  The Palestinian leadership welcomed this effort, this step in the right direction
*04:07.320- 04:17.180* :  and emphasized that of course our position has been always to have an immediate ceasefire
*04:17.620- 04:19.220* :  to stop the killing of our people.
*04:20.580- 04:23.280* :  So this resolution is a step in that direction.
*04:24.000- 04:29.180* :  The vote came after Washington's top diplomat Anthony Blinken held talks in Israel
*04:29.180- 04:33.860* :  with the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I spoke to an author America correspondent
*04:33.860- 04:38.940* :  Netta Tawfik who's at the UN and asked what this resolution proposes.
*04:39.420- 04:45.440* :  This resolution essentially endorses the deal that was proposed by President Biden 10 days ago
*04:45.960- 04:52.700* :  and it outlines in the resolution the three phases that the United States outlined the first
*04:52.700- 05:00.020* :  to get an immediate ceasefire to get the hostages released, the women, the elderly, the wounded in
*05:00.020- 05:04.960* :  exchange for Palestinian prisoners and then to have the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
*05:04.960- 05:11.220* :  populated areas in Gaza and to have more aid going in. Eventually they say that would lead to
*05:11.240- 05:16.640* :  phase two and three where you would see major reconstruction of Gaza, the full withdrawal
*05:16.780- 05:23.520* :  of all forces and they make the point that if phase one goes beyond kind of the six weeks needed
*05:23.520- 05:30.200* :  that a ceasefire will remain in place as long as negotiations do and the resolution also rejects
*05:30.280- 05:37.160* :  any changes to Gaza's territorial size and integrity. So laying out the parameters, the
*05:37.160- 05:42.900* :  framework for a deal in this resolution. Hamas is said to have put out a statement saying it
*05:42.900- 05:48.500* :  welcomes the resolution. There's a lot of pressure on Hamas to accept it, isn't there?
*05:48.760- 05:54.360* :  That's right. I mean, I don't think to coincidence that this resolution passed at the same time
*05:54.360- 05:59.420* :  that Anthony Blinken is on his eighth visit to the region. The United States says they've been
*05:59.420- 06:04.960* :  working around the clock with Qatar and Egypt to reach a deal and what we're hearing publicly
*06:04.960- 06:10.040* :  from the United States is that this is an Israeli initiative, this proposal. They've already accepted
*06:10.720- 06:16.500* :  so the pressure needs to be on Hamas and they wanted this resolution to put pressure on Hamas.
*06:16.600- 06:22.760* :  Now what we heard though from Russia, China, others is some skepticism that Israel has accepted
*06:22.760- 06:27.460* :  the steel. They point to some of the statements made by Israeli officials that this war is going
*06:27.460- 06:33.540* :  to continue until they defeat Hamas. They see statements coming from far-right ministers that are
*06:33.540- 06:38.200* :  threatening to collapse the government if it's implemented. And so even though this resolution
*06:38.860- 06:43.760* :  did pass, Russia ultimately abstained because the Arab group was on board and wanted this,
*06:44.380- 06:50.580* :  but they did note that there seems to be a bit of a difference between what the U.S. is saying
*06:50.580- 06:54.880* :  publicly and what Israel really feels about the steel. Well, that's the thing, isn't there
*06:54.880- 07:00.840* :  is there going to be a complete ceasefire which Hamas has said is always absolutely essential or
*07:00.840- 07:07.780* :  isn't there? Because Israel has been clear it's not stopping until it sees it defeated Hamas.
*07:08.040- 07:13.580* :  Yeah, and I think, look, China in their statement noted that the other previous Security Council
*07:13.580- 07:18.940* :  resolutions, the last three, haven't been implemented, calling for a ceasefire during the month of
*07:18.940- 07:25.200* :  Ramadan, calling for more aid to go in. So the question is, will this time be any different?
*07:25.200- 07:32.160* :  I think while getting resolutions is useful in terms of pressure on the parties, I think the real
*07:32.160- 07:38.700* :  test is, of course, going to be what Anthony Blinken is able to achieve. I mean, time is obviously
*07:38.700- 07:44.660* :  kind of running out. They're trying to get something done before the U.S. presidential election in
*07:44.660- 07:50.420* :  November. Israeli politics have certainly made this deal more fragile. Hamas hasn't responded with
*07:50.420- 07:55.000* :  a counter-proposal to the United States on the deal on the table yet, even though it's welcomed
*07:55.000- 08:02.000* :  this resolution. So a lot in flux. Net atopic. The leader of Malawi says he's ordered the
*08:02.000- 08:08.240* :  search and rescue operation for his vice president, Salos Chalima, to continue until the aircraft
*08:08.240- 08:14.940* :  carrying him and nine others is found. President Lazarus Chakwera said no effort would be spared and
*08:14.940- 08:19.600* :  has cancelled a scheduled trip abroad. The military aircraft is thought to have come down in
*08:19.600- 08:25.120* :  bad weather on Monday morning, shortly after being turned away from an airport in Mezuzu because
*08:25.120- 08:30.080* :  of poor visibility. The passengers on board were due to attend the funeral of a former justice
*08:30.540- 08:36.540* :  reporter, Shinghai Nyokha, gave us this update from Zimbabwe. Well, a statement that was released
*08:36.540- 08:43.620* :  earlier said that the vice president, as well as nine others, were aboard a Malawi defense force
*08:43.620- 08:51.120* :  aircraft that left La Longue, which is the capital of Malawi at about 915 local time and was headed
*08:51.120- 08:56.920* :  north and it was supposed to arrive about 45 minutes after it departed, but then at some point
*08:56.940- 09:04.240* :  the aircraft went off radar and they have failed to locate it and so that search has been underway
*09:04.240- 09:10.600* :  for many hours now conducted by various agencies. They didn't really say where they suspect that
*09:10.600- 09:16.100* :  this aircraft might have gone down, but local media reports say that it might, that the search has
*09:16.100- 09:23.020* :  been concentrated around a particular forest just north of the capital. Unofficially through the
*09:23.020- 09:28.720* :  reports on social media as well as through local media, it seems to be an assumption that
*09:28.720- 09:34.500* :  his plane might have crashed. We still also don't have details about who else was on board.
*09:34.500- 09:39.880* :  We understand that he was on government business. This is according to a minister who confirmed
*09:39.880- 09:46.060* :  that to the BBC that he was on his way to a funeral in Mezuzu in the northern part of the country.
*09:46.560- 09:52.260* :  Shingai Nyoka. Political parties in France are racing to field candidates and discuss
*09:52.260- 09:57.800* :  possible alliances after President Emmanuel Macron called an early parliamentary election.
*09:58.220- 10:03.160* :  The decision was made following his party's defeat in the European elections in which the far
*10:03.160- 10:09.540* :  right national rally secured an overwhelming victory. The socialist mayor of Paris and Edelgo
*10:09.540- 10:15.760* :  said holding another vote so close to the Olympic Games was unsettling. Our correspondent
*10:15.760- 10:19.320* :  in Paris, Husco Field, has been gauging reaction.
*10:22.400- 10:27.440* :  Coulombier, 30 miles east of the capital, is where Paris ends and the provinces begin.
*10:27.940- 10:33.780* :  More than a third of voters here chose Jordan Badella and the national rally. Why? Because they say
*10:33.780- 10:39.320* :  their concerns are routinely ignored by the powers that be. Concerns says Josiane,
*10:39.320- 10:46.680* :  like immigration and insecurity. 40 years ago, this was a nice place. Nobody was aggressive.
*10:47.260- 10:52.520* :  You could go out at night for a stroll, but now we are afraid. I'm just coming back from the
*10:52.520- 10:58.040* :  post office and I'm sorry to say, but everyone there was in our object. In three weeks everyone
*10:58.040- 11:04.280* :  will be voting again. This time not for distant MEPs, but for national lawmakers. Everyone agrees
*11:04.280- 11:09.620* :  it was a massive gamble by President Macron to call early elections. He may be hoping that the
*11:09.620- 11:14.860* :  national rally can't possibly replicate its European triumph, but he can't possibly be sure.
*11:15.760- 11:20.600* :  One theory is that he wants to let the far right into power in order to see it fail.
*11:20.620- 11:26.740* :  But that says Pascal Perino of the Seonspo School of Political Science is also a gamble.
*11:27.000- 11:31.580* :  Macron can be spirit, perhaps, a museum. President Macron may be betting that the national rally
*11:31.580- 11:35.820* :  isn't ready for government and that, in the end, it will all turn out badly for them.
*11:36.520- 11:41.140* :  But will that necessarily be the case? In lots of countries in the EU, the far right is in
*11:41.140- 11:46.320* :  government and life goes on. So I think if that is his bet, it's a very risky one.
*11:46.820- 11:50.480* :  This evening, the political parties in France are scrambling to prepare for this sudden
*11:50.480- 11:56.000* :  electoral consultation. The left is calling without much hope for a united front to block the
*11:56.000- 12:01.380* :  national rally. The president knows it's his own future as well as the countries that is at stake.
*12:01.860- 12:07.540* :  Use go field in Paris. In the wake of the right-wing gains in some European countries,
*12:07.540- 12:12.340* :  Germany's Chancellor Olaf Schultz has described the results as worrying, adding,
*12:12.340- 12:17.800* :  one should not get used to it. The president of the European Commission, Ursula Fondolin,
*12:17.800- 12:20.980* :  insisted the political centre was holding.
*12:21.440- 12:26.920* :  A European attack, Katja Adler, has this assessment of what the results mean for the future
*12:26.920- 12:32.860* :  direction of European politics. The hard right just won big across Europe and notably inside
*12:32.860- 12:38.440* :  the EU's power couple France and Germany. What does this mean? The wins in Europe are definitely
*12:38.440- 12:44.340* :  blowing rightwards, dominated by mainstream conservatives with a question around how much
*12:44.340- 12:49.820* :  they'll work with parties on the hard right. Clues can be found by following the fortunes
*12:49.820- 12:55.820* :  of three high-profile female politicians. Ursula Fondolin is the president of the European
*12:55.820- 13:00.680* :  Commission, campaigning for a second term. She's one of many on the centre right, who now
*13:00.680- 13:06.040* :  ate the language of the hard right on issues like migration. She hopes to broaden her appeal,
*13:06.040- 13:11.960* :  and she's allied herself with Italy's Prime Minister, Georgia Miloni, an example of former far
*13:11.960- 13:17.840* :  right figures moderating their image to attract the mainstream. Where Ms. Miloni once openly
*13:17.840- 13:23.680* :  praised Benito Mussolini, her country's 20th century fascist dictator, she now cites Margaret
*13:23.680- 13:29.200* :  Thatcher as her muse. She's become a kingmaker on the European stage, courted by the centre right,
*13:29.200- 13:35.440* :  and those on the far right, like France's Marine Le Pen. She's still viewed in Brussels as an
*13:35.440- 13:41.000* :  extreme right disruptor, but she's hoping French voters in their snap election this summer will show
*13:41.000- 13:48.880* :  her politics of the future. Katja Adler One year ago, the headteachers at all the primary schools
*13:48.880- 13:54.820* :  in the Irish town of Greystones got together, concerned by increasing levels of anxiety among
*13:54.820- 14:00.460* :  their pupils, they asked parents to sign a voluntary pledge or code to delay buying smartphones
*14:00.460- 14:06.020* :  for their children until at least the start of secondary school, which in Ireland is at age 12.
*14:06.060- 14:10.940* :  Beth McLeod has been to the town to see how the initiative has been received by
*14:10.940- 14:23.140* :  parents and pupils. At the gates of St Patrick's primary school, groups of children in blue
*14:23.140- 14:27.660* :  uniform wave goodbye to their parents and hello to their headteacher Rachel Harper.
*14:32.220- 14:36.820* :  The children here are getting used to visits from reporters. The school has been on the news in
*14:36.820- 14:43.040* :  Canada, the US, India, France, Spain for a trailblazing initiative that taps into a heated global
*14:43.040- 14:48.520* :  debate where the smartphones are damaging young people's mental health. We could see phones creeping
*14:48.520- 14:53.960* :  in actually in a very small way with nine year olds and ten year olds, you know, and as the
*14:53.960- 14:59.500* :  bows with that came then the children started going on WhatsApp, you know, and we were as teachers
*14:59.500- 15:06.500* :  dealing with kids being left out or kids being upset. A recent major survey found that by the
*15:06.500- 15:11.740* :  time they leave primary school nearly three quarters of children in Ireland have their own smartphone
*15:11.820- 15:18.060* :  and a smaller poll found that a quarter of six year olds do. We found, and as a group of
*15:18.060- 15:22.680* :  principals, that they were just growing up so quickly, we found like we would have had
*15:22.880- 15:28.020* :  second class going swimming and what they would be around the age of eight or nine and already
*15:28.020- 15:33.660* :  they were very body conscious. You wouldn't let your child open the door to room for the strangers
*15:33.980- 15:38.540* :  and leave them in that room on their own and unfortunately that is what's happening when they
*15:38.540- 15:44.400* :  had a smart device. Rachel Harper says that before the code was introduced, nearly all the people's
*15:44.400- 15:51.060* :  in their final year had a smartphone, now only a handful do. This nine year old people is also
*15:51.060- 15:59.360* :  called Rachel. I haven't really heard anyone film like our class or anywhere younger saying they
*15:59.360- 16:06.480* :  want a phone. So do you feel like you're missing out on anything by being at a school where smartphones
*16:06.480- 16:14.340* :  are discouraged? Actually not because you're missing out at something when the whole school has it,
*16:14.920- 16:21.460* :  when no one in this county has it that means you're not missing out on anything. Most tech companies
*16:21.460- 16:27.240* :  offer parental controls on their apps and Meta says it's responded to criticism by putting new
*16:27.240- 16:31.700* :  policies in place to protect young people. I really want to emphasise we're not against technology.
*16:32.300- 16:37.440* :  We know that technology is a huge part in the modern world and also in children's education.
*16:38.140- 16:43.040* :  So we feel like if they have online time at home that it should be monitored that it's a family
*16:43.580- 16:46.760* :  iPad that they're using that parents can just keep checking in.
*16:51.200- 16:56.760* :  At home time children pour out of classrooms. Most of the parents I speak to say they feel
*16:56.760- 17:02.160* :  relieved they don't have to choose between giving their child a smartphone or leaving them socially
*17:02.160- 17:07.060* :  isolated. Now that we've got video games in our house the idea of my 10 year old having a phone
*17:07.060- 17:11.700* :  is absolutely terrifying so the longer we can fan that off the better and to be honest since the
*17:11.700- 17:15.840* :  policy has been brought into the school the children themselves don't even want to have phone so
*17:15.840- 17:21.380* :  that conversation hasn't arisen for us which has been amazing. By coming together as a community the
*17:21.380- 17:27.200* :  town seems to have created a culture shift but it's still the norm to get a smartphone at the
*17:27.200- 17:33.720* :  start of secondary school. Some question if that's also too young. We are getting much more
*17:33.720- 17:37.880* :  referrals into mental health services we're getting much more referrals into emergency departments.
*17:37.920- 17:43.180* :  Stephen Donnelly the Irish Health Minister who also happens to be a Greystone's parent
*17:43.760- 17:48.780* :  thinks the initiative is a great way to reduce some of the harm he says is being done to young people
*17:49.620- 17:54.480* :  and according to him governments are starting to force tech companies to do more.
*17:54.840- 17:59.540* :  For them to have a long-term business they need a long-term business that is not linked to
*17:59.540- 18:06.280* :  children killing themselves the best thing that they can do is make sure that they're heavily
*18:06.280- 18:12.080* :  regulated fully transparent that they bring in proper age verification what I would do is move
*18:12.080- 18:18.840* :  the age to 16 and I would have age. What saps just moved the age down from 16 to 13 hasn't it?
*18:18.940- 18:23.860* :  Right. In the EU and UK so they seem to be going opposite direction. Yeah I would move it to 16.
*18:24.040- 18:28.060* :  Do you think there's any sign that that would happen? We have an important moment in time now
*18:28.060- 18:36.780* :  to work together and I think we will look back at the last five or ten years in time with horror.
*18:37.400- 18:39.720* :  I think we will look back and say this was the Wild West.
*18:40.760- 18:47.200* :  The Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly ending that report from Beth McLeod and you can hear more
*18:47.200- 18:51.580* :  in this week's edition of assignment on the BBC World Service.
*18:54.600- 19:00.020* :  Still to come the prospect of a single vaccination for both Covid and flu.
*19:00.420- 19:04.860* :  You get one dose, one needle, that's just two needles. I don't think a lot of people like needles
*19:04.860- 19:05.720* :  so that would be helpful.
*19:44.740- 19:46.420* :  So how do we get AI right?
*19:46.840- 19:53.620* :  Well we need the right volume of data, the software to train it and massive compute power or
*19:53.660- 19:59.960* :  another one bites the dust. Are you ready? Are you ready for this? Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?

*20:19.680- 20:26.720* :  This is the Global News Podcast. Poland says it's planning to reintroduce a no-go zone on its
*20:26.720- 20:32.400* :  border with Biela Rus on Thursday following the death of a Polish soldier who was stabbed by a migrant.
*20:32.400- 20:37.560* :  The Poland Biela Rus border has become a flashpoint since migrants started arriving there
*20:37.900- 20:42.640* :  in large numbers in 2021. Adam Eastern reports from Warsaw.
*20:43.040- 20:47.400* :  Prime Minister Don Tuss said the no-go zone would make it more difficult for migrants to cross
*20:47.400- 20:53.000* :  into Poland from Biela Rus illegally by creating more secure conditions for border guards,
*20:53.000- 20:57.760* :  police and soldiers to work in. Rights groups have criticized the plan saying the services will
*20:57.760- 21:03.860* :  be able to push back migrants and asylum seekers without oversight. A no-go zone was originally
*21:03.860- 21:09.240* :  introduced after a huge increase in migrant crossings started three years ago. It was abolished
*21:09.240- 21:14.280* :  after a five and a half meter tall steel pole border fence was erected, despite the fence
*21:14.280- 21:21.280* :  crossing attempts have surged in recent weeks. Adam Eastern. In a Spanish court case that has been
*21:21.280- 21:26.300* :  described as victory for the fight against racism in the country, three football fans have been
*21:26.300- 21:31.560* :  sentenced to eight months in prison for racist abuse at a football match in May last year.
*21:31.960- 21:36.960* :  Three Valencia fans were convicted for racially abusing Benicio's junior who plays for
*21:36.960- 21:43.240* :  Real Madrid. The guilty fans have also been banned from entering any football stadium in Spain
*21:43.240- 21:49.540* :  for two years. It's the first conviction for racism-related cases in professional football
*21:49.540- 21:55.640* :  in the country. Susana Gisbert, the prosecutor in the case, spoke to the media outside a court
*21:55.640- 22:04.260* :  in Valencia. People know that this type of act is punishable. It is punishable as a hate crime
*22:04.260- 22:10.580* :  because the sentence is for moral integrity with the aggravating factor of hate. And it is also
*22:10.580- 22:15.840* :  very important that one of the factors taken into account for the suspension of the sentence
*22:15.900- 22:21.940* :  is the fact of repentance and a letter of public apology, as well as being banned from football
*22:21.940- 22:28.960* :  stadiums where matches are held. Benicio's junior who is black has suffered ongoing racist abuse.
*22:29.440- 22:32.300* :  A reporter Guy Hedgeco sent this report from Madrid.
*22:32.860- 22:37.400* :  Benicio's junior was playing for Real Madrid in a league game in Valencia's stadium
*22:37.800- 22:42.460* :  when a group of opposition fans shouted racist insults and made monkey noises at him.
*22:43.100- 22:48.000* :  The game came to a halt as a player ran to the sideline and confronted them. The three men
*22:48.000- 22:52.940* :  prosecuted have been given eight-month sentences, although they are unlikely to serve jail time
*22:52.940- 22:58.160* :  because it's a short sentence for a nonviolent crime. They've also been banned from attending
*22:58.160- 23:04.100* :  top-tier games for two years and have written an apology to Benicio's junior. The incident
*23:04.100- 23:09.720* :  triggered a major debate about racism in Spanish football and even caused diplomatic tensions with
*23:09.720- 23:15.300* :  Brazil. The president of the Spanish Football League, Javier Debas, welcomed the court's decision,
*23:15.760- 23:20.480* :  calling it great news for the fight against racism in Spain. Guy Hedgeco.
*23:21.360- 23:29.440* :  New research in Singapore suggests there could have been 135 million premature deaths caused by
*23:29.440- 23:35.340* :  one kind of pollution. Fine particles in the air, over a 40-year period. The researchers believe
*23:35.340- 23:40.420* :  more than half of those deaths were in China and India. Asia-Pacific Regional Editor Mickey
*23:40.420- 23:45.940* :  Breastay reports. The World Health Organization has already told us that millions of people die each
*23:45.940- 23:51.620* :  year from fine particles in the air. These are caused by vehicle emissions, industrial processes,
*23:51.620- 23:58.580* :  wildfires and dust storms, also by households that use open fires. The researchers from Singapore
*23:58.580- 24:02.980* :  have put a number on those who they estimate have died because of this pollution,
*24:03.640- 24:11.640* :  135 million between 1980 and 2020. And these are premature deaths. People who died earlier than
*24:11.640- 24:17.640* :  expected by something that was preventable. Mickey Breastay. The American biotech company
*24:17.640- 24:23.760* :  Moderna says it's developed a combined flu and COVID vaccine which targets both diseases as
*24:23.760- 24:31.120* :  effectively as separate injections. Here's our medical editor, Fergus Walsh. 8,000 volunteers aged
*24:31.120- 24:38.120* :  over 50 took part in the trial which measured antibody levels after vaccination. The result showed
*24:38.120- 24:45.060* :  Moderna's combined COVID and flu vaccine produced immune responses which were at least as good as
*24:45.060- 24:51.040* :  having similar jabs separately. Side effects from the combined vaccine were generally mild.
*24:51.900- 24:57.700* :  Moderna's chief executive, Stefan Bancel, told the BBC it would spare people the need for two
*24:57.700- 25:03.600* :  injections and boost vaccine coverage. You get one dose, one needle, that's just two needles.
*25:04.140- 25:08.120* :  I don't think a lot of people like needles so that would be helpful. Very good. The highest
*25:08.120- 25:15.000* :  value from a public health standpoint is ensuring everybody gets protected. The two in one vaccine uses
*25:15.000- 25:23.080* :  the same messenger RNA technology as found in current COVID jabs. The mRNA instructs the body
*25:23.080- 25:29.800* :  to make proteins found in the COVID and flu viruses which then prompts an immune response.
*25:30.580- 25:36.040* :  Moderna's competitors, Pfizer and biotech are also testing a similar dual shot.
*25:36.780- 25:41.480* :  Subject to approval by licensing bodies, it seems likely that in years to come,
*25:41.480- 25:49.280* :  adults may be offered a combined jab. Fergus Walsh. Wildfires are raging across the world's
*25:49.280- 25:55.520* :  largest tropical wetland, the Pantanal, in Brazil. Local media are reporting that more than 30,000
*25:55.520- 26:01.920* :  hectares have already been destroyed. According to climate experts, the wildfire season started earlier
*26:01.920- 26:07.740* :  than normal. Paul Henley spoke to Arno Desbier, the president of the Wild Animal Conservation
*26:07.740- 26:13.260* :  Institute of Brazilian Charity, who has been working on the Pantanal for more than 20 years.
*26:13.880- 26:19.520* :  The season of fires has started very early. Normally, at this time of the year, June,
*26:19.520- 26:26.760* :  the Pantanal should still be with large expanses flooded. However, this year we have not had a wet
*26:26.760- 26:32.540* :  season. And so the fires have started really early. And I'm just looking at some numbers here.
*26:33.500- 26:41.560* :  This year, between the 1st of January to the 7th of June, we have already had 1,193 fires.
*26:42.300- 26:47.780* :  And in the same period last year, we had 106 fires. So as you can see, this year, there's a
*26:47.780- 26:54.160* :  dramatic increase in the number of fires. Can you paint a picture of this region? It's an important
*26:54.160- 27:00.880* :  wildlife habitat, isn't it? Well, yes. Well, in fact, in Portuguese, Pantanal means swan. So what I
*27:00.880- 27:06.420* :  should normally be describing to you is a mosaic environment of pockets of forests, then the rest
*27:06.420- 27:12.040* :  quite flooded. But this year, the Pantanal is really dry. So the Paraguay River has never been
*27:12.040- 27:18.180* :  destroyed. It's two meters below what it should be. There's no navigation. Pantanal usually has a
*27:18.180- 27:24.060* :  marked wet season and a marked dry season. But this year, yeah, the rains have simply not arrived.
*27:24.060- 27:30.720* :  So we can see everything is bone dry, very, very dry. So there's a lot of dry matter, organic matter.
*27:31.340- 27:37.900* :  And the humidity is very low. So it's very, very, very easy for the Pantanal to catch fire.
*27:38.620- 27:42.900* :  And what people have to try to imagine is that this huge area, which is the Pantanal, there are no
*27:42.900- 27:47.980* :  roads. So access is really difficult. So it's really hard to put out a fire once it started.
*27:48.480- 27:53.660* :  What kind of species live there? Oh, the Pantanal is well known for the diversity of species that
*27:53.660- 27:59.120* :  is found here. We have large populations of jaguars, giant otters, marsh deer,
*27:59.120- 28:06.020* :  pompous deer, tapers, giant anteaters. And my NGO in the Pantanal, we work with giant armadillos.
*28:06.020- 28:10.180* :  And this is the place where there's healthy populations of giant armadillos.
*28:10.680- 28:17.060* :  It sounds as if these populations were already threatened by the lack of rain before the fires
*28:17.060- 28:22.820* :  arrived. Would that be right? No, the Pantanal has a high diversity of species, but not endemic species.
*28:23.260- 28:29.660* :  And the animals here are used to these extreme fluctuations of flooded or dry. So the species
*28:29.660- 28:36.340* :  would not be suffering too much. However, if the fires are anything like 2020, this can be really
*28:36.340- 28:42.980* :  catastrophic for wildlife, but also for people. Oh, no, despa president of the Wild Animal Conservation
*28:42.980- 28:52.120* :  Institute in Brazil. And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the
