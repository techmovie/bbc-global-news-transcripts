*01:26.600- 01:30.680* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday,
*01:30.680- 01:35.620* :  the 4th of June. With most of the votes counted in India's election, the Hindu
*01:35.620- 01:40.120* :  Nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks set to win a third term in office,
*01:40.120- 01:45.980* :  but lose his majority. Katar says it's waiting for a clear position from Israel on the
*01:45.980- 01:51.760* :  Gaza Peace Plan and one of Thailand's most wanted fugitives is extradited from Indonesia.
*01:54.900- 01:59.920* :  Also in the podcast, there was this one case where a published article started the introduction
*01:59.920- 02:03.860* :  with the sentence was sure I can help you with that introduction. So it was something that was
*02:03.860- 02:09.560* :  kind of obviously written by one of these chatbots. The growing use of AI and scientific research papers.
*02:14.680- 02:21.080* :  Ahead of India's six-week general election, the ruling BJP said it aimed to win 400 seats.
*02:21.100- 02:26.380* :  That supermajority would have allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to change the constitution
*02:26.380- 02:32.280* :  and reinforce his Hindu nationalist agenda, prompting an opposition forget to warn of a possible
*02:32.300- 02:40.860* :  dictatorship. But with more than 90% of the 642 million votes counted, the BJP is falling short
*02:40.860- 02:49.300* :  of that target. It is on course to lose its majority, winning about 240 seats down from 303 last
*02:49.300- 02:55.240* :  time. The party will still be able to govern with its allies, making Mr Modi the first leader since
*02:55.240- 03:01.400* :  Narew to win a third straight term as Prime Minister. Sayed Zafar, Islam is the national
*03:01.400- 03:08.620* :  spokesman for the BJP. Whatever the result be, it is primarily because of the love and admiration
*03:08.620- 03:13.720* :  of the people of this country. They have voted for the Prime Minister. They had voted in the past.
*03:13.720- 03:18.580* :  They are voting this time also to ensure that a good governance model can choose in the country.
*03:19.240- 03:23.980* :  Tsegarika Goesh is a member of India's upper house of Parliament and a leader of the
*03:23.980- 03:28.640* :  Opposition Trinimal Congress Party. The opposition was being targeted by agencies,
*03:28.660- 03:32.660* :  we were being targeted by institutions, we were targeted by money power, we were being targeted
*03:32.660- 03:39.740* :  by media power. In spite of that, the Indian voter, the humble Indian voter has rejected all this
*03:39.740- 03:45.640* :  propaganda, rejected all this authoritarian personality culture, Mr Narendra Modi. As far as
*03:46.100- 03:50.720* :  I am concerned, I think Mr Modi has suffered a decisive personal defeat.
*03:51.480- 03:57.420* :  Turnout was 66 per cent slightly lower than last time which analysts put down to the
*03:57.420- 04:03.520* :  heat wave in parts of India that left dozens of polling staff dead. As counting continued,
*04:03.520- 04:10.220* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Delhi, Divya Arya. The BJP is very short of a simple majority,
*04:10.220- 04:18.920* :  which would be 272 past 272 in a 543 seat parliament. They are clearly going to
*04:18.920- 04:26.960* :  ally, depend on their allies to cross that to 73 mark. But it seems that the biggest news
*04:26.960- 04:33.840* :  is not just that Mr Modi has got a drawing because the whole election campaign was literally run
*04:33.840- 04:40.220* :  in his name and on his face. He was on billboards everywhere we travel to, towering over
*04:40.220- 04:46.760* :  the local leaders who were contesting in those constituencies. In rally after rally, he repeated
*04:46.760- 04:53.780* :  the campaign pitch which was Modi's guarantee. So he kept saying that vote for me. So all votes were
*04:53.780- 04:59.960* :  not for the local candidates, but for the prime minister himself because he was guaranteeing that
*04:59.960- 05:03.960* :  he would deliver on all the promises that his government has made in the last decade.
*05:04.940- 05:12.840* :  So clearly it is a mandate that is speaking about his popularity and him as a guarantee figure.
*05:13.360- 05:20.720* :  And the other part is of course the resurgence of federal politics of regional parties as well as
*05:20.720- 05:26.960* :  the Congress party which had received a huge rubbing in 2019. Congress has almost doubled
*05:26.960- 05:33.160* :  its tally and by the time the voting closes, the counting closes, they may even better that.
*05:33.720- 05:38.880* :  Narendra Modi, a massive figure on the world stage at home, he's been accused of cultivating
*05:39.460- 05:44.700* :  a personality cult. Why does his attraction appear to be fading at least at home?
*05:47.040- 05:52.700* :  Well a lot of people criticise the divisive nature of his campaign. A lot of Muslims I met said
*05:52.700- 06:00.280* :  that nothing is really left to doubt anymore. It is so unabashed. It's so out there and it seems
*06:00.280- 06:07.340* :  that it's okay to be anti-Muslim or to voice hate speech because it is being done by leaders
*06:07.340- 06:13.800* :  of the ruling party including the prime minister who called Muslims infiltrators in one speech.
*06:13.800- 06:20.320* :  In another speech he said choose between vote jihad which seem to refer to a jihad by Muslims
*06:20.320- 06:26.800* :  through their vote power voting power comparing it to the rule of law drama. So do you want
*06:26.800- 06:30.880* :  vote jihad or do you want the rule of law drama? So those kind of speeches which were
*06:31.200- 06:38.200* :  flagged by the opposition to the election commission were cited to us by ordinary Muslims but
*06:38.200- 06:44.880* :  even ordinary Hindus who felt that this kind of divisive campaign wasn't in good taste and wasn't
*06:44.880- 06:51.540* :  good for democracy. That said that may not be the only reason we have witnessed highest levels
*06:51.540- 06:55.960* :  of unemployment and inflation in the past few years and they run up to these elections
*06:55.960- 07:01.260* :  and those may have had a huge role to play as well. And briefly might we say a different style
*07:01.260- 07:07.500* :  of governing if these results turn out to be the final result? We very well could because this
*07:07.500- 07:14.160* :  BJP will have to rely on its allies. It will have to build consensus. It has been accused of bulldozing
*07:14.160- 07:20.240* :  various kinds of legislations including laws that govern media, curtail speech
*07:21.880- 07:26.940* :  has changed the way the election commission for example is constituted making it a body that is
*07:26.940- 07:33.660* :  majority really got the ruling parties representatives. So those kind of legislations would be harder to
*07:33.660- 07:38.820* :  push through they will have to build consensus including in the various policies they are now going
*07:38.820- 07:45.960* :  to push for in the new term. Divya Arya in Delhi two key regional allies of Narendra Modi's coalition
*07:45.960- 07:52.200* :  have endorsed him as India's next prime minister meaning he is likely to get that historic third term.
*07:52.600- 07:59.120* :  But after the BJP lost its majority should this be seen as a victory or a defeat for the strongman
*07:59.120- 08:06.000* :  leader. Here's our South Asia regional editor and about Sun Eti Rajan. He made it all because of him.
*08:06.000- 08:12.600* :  It was all about himself in the campaign. So he was campaigning in all the seven faces. So he
*08:12.600- 08:18.240* :  became the center of attention the lead campaigner. So for his supporters this will see they will
*08:18.240- 08:24.660* :  see this as a personal defeat for Mr Narendra Modi because of what it has done is it prick the bubble
*08:24.660- 08:32.280* :  of his invincibility about his authority in the country that he was a leader above everyone else
*08:32.280- 08:38.640* :  in the country itself. Now the results also mean that for those who are watching how the democratic
*08:38.640- 08:43.500* :  path this India is taking will be we see they want a strong opposition party in parliament.
*08:43.980- 08:49.960* :  So this will also encourage other independent institutions empower institutions like the supreme
*08:49.960- 08:56.240* :  code and the media to take a more objective look and then see whether they can criticize the
*08:56.240- 09:01.580* :  government's policies or they can take actions on some of the contentious issues. Now there is a
*09:01.760- 09:07.580* :  fear among what when I speak to many of the bureaucrats and journalists say what will happen if I say
*09:07.580- 09:15.240* :  against Mr Modi. So this result has in a way diminished his authority and his aura as you can
*09:15.240- 09:21.580* :  explain about Modi and this can have a long-term implications. Yeah I mean is this a watershed moment
*09:21.580- 09:26.740* :  for India if he had got that majority he could have enshrined this Hindu nationalist agenda
*09:27.200- 09:33.080* :  changed the country for well for many many years but now we're seeing Congress the opposition
*09:33.080- 09:39.300* :  recovering slightly so things looking very different. There was a real fear that if the BJP had
*09:39.300- 09:44.860* :  got a massive majority you know things could have gotten worse in terms of what the BJP called
*09:44.860- 09:50.320* :  Hindu supremacy the ideas the kind of re-emphasizing among the public and this was the one of the first
*09:50.320- 09:54.860* :  election in my 30 years I've seen where the political parties in the opposition talking about
*09:54.860- 10:00.540* :  save the constitution save democracy save the rights of people you know this has come back people
*10:00.540- 10:06.060* :  are holding the constitution book in their hand in campaign like we need to save the constitution
*10:06.060- 10:10.940* :  this is quite remarkable people coming back in expressing their authority and willingness to fight
*10:10.940- 10:16.400* :  for the country. Now the Congress coming back will give them more energy now they know that Modi
*10:16.400- 10:22.620* :  can be defeated and Modi can be you know challenged in a people's court so that will give them the
*10:22.620- 10:27.320* :  advantage in the coming elections and that will be set a new course for the Congress party and it's
*10:27.320- 10:33.780* :  alice our South Asia regional editor and barsan at irajan there are now thought to be fewer than
*10:33.780- 10:40.200* :  80 hostages left alive in gaza after four more were confirmed dead by israel on monday
*10:40.860- 10:47.680* :  we assisted the four of them were killed well together in the area of canunis during our operation
*10:47.680- 10:54.380* :  there against ramas the information we confirmed by the relevant bodies after assessing new
*10:54.380- 11:00.920* :  intelligence that we gathered over the last few weeks israeli military spokesman rear admiral
*11:00.920- 11:07.220* :  daniel hagari the chances of further hostage releases will depend on ceasefire talks which are
*11:07.220- 11:13.340* :  being coordinated by cata it's foreign ministry says it's still waiting for a clear israeli
*11:13.340- 11:19.420* :  position on the proposal made public by president biden on friday hostage negotiator michi bergman
*11:19.460- 11:24.360* :  has suggested that if israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu is not prepared to strike a
*11:24.360- 11:30.420* :  deal with hamas then the u.s president could pursue his own agreement for those american citizens
*11:30.420- 11:36.340* :  still being held but how close might a deal be michi bergman has been talking to the bbc ceremony
*11:38.180- 11:45.500* :  you i wish i i was optimistic on this but i can tell you sir that after the first deal
*11:46.220- 11:50.560* :  it collapsed after it was successful for a while there were about ten fourteen days of fighting
*11:50.560- 11:56.100* :  in which negotiations didn't happen i flew back to doha at the request of members of the israeli
*11:56.100- 12:01.880* :  mission to explore what is available and what is possible for next round and i can tell you that
*12:01.880- 12:07.900* :  as of mid-december a deal very similar to the deal that we have now was on the table
*12:08.960- 12:13.840* :  but we entered a very frustrating part from there until now this is about six months
*12:14.680- 12:21.440* :  in which we had to try and convince israelis and hamas to come together and to agree at least
*12:21.960- 12:27.280* :  to get into this first stage of this agreement one of the reasons that we have these gaps
*12:27.940- 12:35.120* :  or this on the inability to execute is because there's a real gap between what the prime minister
*12:35.120- 12:41.220* :  of israel is willing to commit to and what hamas is demanding now there's a complete mismatch
*12:41.580- 12:46.440* :  between the israelis and hamas in the standing what how negotiations work or how they should work
*12:47.020- 12:54.820* :  but right now we saw president Biden last weekend and basically outing the proposition that he
*12:54.820- 13:01.200* :  believed bbc Netanyahu has provided him over and over again he made it public in order to pressure
*13:01.760- 13:07.600* :  the israeli prime minister to stick with it um but in the next few days we're going to see
*13:07.600- 13:12.680* :  whether the prime minister if he wants the negotiations to succeed he needs to publicly talk about
*13:12.680- 13:19.600* :  what has been achieved and what is in common but he has again stated that his primarily his priority
*13:19.600- 13:24.440* :  is the elimination of hamas he says we want we've gone the extra mile to bring them back
*13:25.080- 13:31.660* :  but the goals of the war primarily the elimination of hamas and fortunately that's why i am not very
*13:31.660- 13:36.820* :  optimistic that even this round will work because the prime minister is focused publicly on highlighting
*13:36.820- 13:43.460* :  the gaps and his unwillingness to commit that going into this agreement in good faith will be the end
*13:43.460- 13:50.420* :  of the war however again this is not exactly what he was telling quietly to the american so the
*13:50.420- 13:56.820* :  fact that the president made it public put bb a little bit in the box and i think if bb indeed
*13:56.820- 14:03.140* :  keeps sabotaging this with with his statements Biden is putting himself in a position we hang where
*14:03.140- 14:09.220* :  he has a moral authority to increase the pressure and potentially even engage in a humanitarian
*14:09.220- 14:16.580* :  indirect track to at least help the american citizens who are still being held and as you
*14:16.580- 14:22.660* :  mentioned they're eight of them you said that in the situation with the gaza hostages now that
*14:22.660- 14:30.240* :  president biden should consider working independently for the us hostages are you seriously suggesting
*14:30.240- 14:37.080* :  that that's the next step not exactly but in principle yes i want to suggest the fact the
*14:37.080- 14:42.880* :  US president has a responsibility for his own citizens now he has worked really hard for eight
*14:42.880- 14:49.480* :  months trying to get a deal for the totality of the hostages and it has been fair it's succeeded
*14:49.480- 14:54.460* :  at the beginning and has been failing since for the last six months over and over again and i
*14:54.460- 15:01.900* :  believe that pursuing a deal that will help get some of the americans back home is not doing it
*15:02.040- 15:07.660* :  in spite of his role despite bb Netanyahu not at all it's a way to demonstrate that it's possible
*15:08.380- 15:12.460* :  and be able to kind of open the door through this so it's not a negative and by the way
*15:12.820- 15:16.920* :  there are americans there are also Israelis there are dual citizens so i think there's an opportunity
*15:16.920- 15:22.020* :  to do that and i think the president has a responsibility to do whatever he can to bring back
*15:22.020- 15:28.180* :  americans home miki Bergman talking to sarah Montague the use of artificial intelligence in
*15:28.180- 15:34.180* :  writing up scientific research has rocketed by 50 percent in the past year according to a study
*15:34.180- 15:40.180* :  of 15,000 academic papers but what does it mean for the accuracy of the research Richard Hamilton
*15:40.180- 15:47.680* :  has been investigating about 18 months ago the tech company open AI unleashed its chatbot
*15:47.680- 15:55.320* :  chat gpt within a couple of months a hundred million users were regularly using this tool
*15:55.840- 16:02.260* :  making it the fastest growing consumer app in history this same phenomenon is being seen in
*16:02.260- 16:08.240* :  scientific research papers doctor Frederick Howard whose assistant professor of medicine
*16:08.240- 16:14.640* :  at the university of chicago looked at the prevalence of artificial intelligence in cancer
*16:14.640- 16:23.640* :  research by using AI content detectors he found that it had doubled in 2023 he says this new
*16:23.640- 16:30.680* :  technology has clear advantages but comes with inherent dangers these tools can really speed up
*16:30.680- 16:35.040* :  the writing process and so that can be definitely a benefit and it can help with maybe the wording
*16:35.040- 16:38.500* :  of sentences you know when you're trying to draft something and you just can't get the right phrase
*16:39.260- 16:44.320* :  but these tools definitely have their limitations too in particular it's been well shown that
*16:44.500- 16:48.180* :  the text that's generated by these models can sometimes contain things that are completely
*16:48.820- 16:54.660* :  fabricated kind of a very clear example is oftentimes if you if you ask to describe a scientific study
*16:54.660- 16:59.700* :  it will give a citation to a study that just doesn't exist and you know it's very demonstrably fake
*17:00.120- 17:06.800* :  the problem is if researchers are using this tool and not adequately reviewing the output of these
*17:06.800- 17:10.580* :  types of large language models then you might end up with things that are being perpetuated in
*17:10.580- 17:16.280* :  the literature that are just untrue doctor Howard says AI is a very powerful tool but it has to
*17:16.280- 17:23.180* :  be used responsibly and stresses the need for proper safeguards to root out factual inaccuracies
*17:23.180- 17:29.160* :  in research papers there is this one case where a published article started the introduction with
*17:29.580- 17:32.900* :  the sentence was sure I can help you with that introduction so it was something that was kind of
*17:32.940- 17:37.060* :  obviously written by one of these chatbots aside from cases like that it's going to be pretty
*17:37.060- 17:42.100* :  difficult to prove with 100% certainty that something was written with one of these tools
*17:42.720- 17:47.040* :  and maybe it will just require the editors to make sure that they're doing due diligence and
*17:47.040- 17:50.560* :  the peer reviewers are doing due diligence to ensure the factual accuracy of content
*17:50.900- 17:57.660* :  despite the rapid rise in the use of artificial intelligence a survey last week of 12,000 people
*17:57.660- 18:05.060* :  across six countries suggested most adults had only tried tools like chat GPT once or twice
*18:05.060- 18:11.980* :  and there was less enthusiasm amongst older people yet even with this generational divide
*18:11.980- 18:18.400* :  artificial intelligence is here to stay and it may be that we just need to control it better
*18:19.120- 18:19.720* :  Richard Hamilton

*20:23.120- 20:25.500* :  an early summer evening in Nireh Chaza
*20:25.900- 20:31.820* :  Peter Maja walks through the adoring crowds like a rock star a dapper 43 years old
*20:32.400- 20:38.640* :  then he swims himself up onto an improvised stage a white pickup truck spray painted with the
*20:44.920- 20:50.040* :  Hungarian trickle as he does so a favorite song of his an anthem by the 80s Hungarian rock band
*20:50.040- 20:54.640* :  east on the 1956 revolution blasts from loudspeakers
*20:57.960- 21:03.320* :  he's a powerful speaker the first charismatic leader the opposition have had for many a long year
*21:08.340- 21:14.540* :  he mercilessly mocks the current government attacks the vast sums it spends on propaganda his
*21:14.540- 21:20.900* :  message is designed to appeal to left and right to reunite a deeply polarized society
*21:26.040- 21:31.200* :  we have to choose between lies and truth corruption and clean public life
*21:31.940- 21:39.280* :  east and west propaganda and real news theft and honesty and finally between fedash and the tisha
*21:43.140- 21:48.120* :  party after the rally his fifth that day he spends an hour and a half shaking hands with the
*21:48.120- 21:54.520* :  crowd listening to their concerns taking selfies with them only then close to 10 in the evening
*21:54.520- 21:57.000* :  does he have time to relax and eat
*22:02.500- 22:08.200* :  the next morning over breakfast in a quiet guesthouse just outside Nireh Chaza we talk
*22:08.880- 22:15.080* :  day by day I am realizing that I made a good decision to quit this system and the situation is
*22:15.080- 22:21.200* :  much worse than I imagined two or three months ago the situation is much worse in the countryside
*22:21.200- 22:28.180* :  poverty is everywhere the disappointment of the people the strong feelings and I hope that
*22:28.180- 22:33.460* :  we will have the chance to defeat urban and this government in a peaceful manner you've been
*22:33.460- 22:40.720* :  very critical of Brussels and the European Union no no I'm not we are a member of a club I know
*22:40.720- 22:45.640* :  Brussels from inside and outside I know the European Parliament as well what the institutions
*22:45.740- 22:52.980* :  we will be a normal and constructive member of the club but if there is a necessity we will be
*22:52.980- 22:58.420* :  critical later may as self confidence is remarkable he doesn't just want to sweep the fedash
*22:58.420- 23:03.800* :  government from power he wants to knock out the current rather ineffective opposition as well
*23:04.540- 23:10.380* :  and unlike other opposition leaders he's proudly national almost nationalist in fact
*23:10.380- 23:16.180* :  he sounds rather like Viktor Orban in his younger years it's a comparison he enjoys
*23:16.960- 23:23.240* :  he was a democratic hero in the 80s 89 he is the most talented politician in the political
*23:23.240- 23:28.040* :  history in Hungary after the regime changed but after that he's personally to change the lot
*23:28.040- 23:33.880* :  I think this is the starting point to be democratic to lead in a democratic way a country that your
*23:33.880- 23:40.340* :  party is democratic and you are not a strong leader but rather a smart leader an inclusive leader
*23:40.980- 23:47.540* :  his message seems to go down well benzer and lily both 24 attended the rally in ui fair
*23:51.120- 23:55.100* :  tall what I like most about him is that he's promising to end this awful division between people
*23:55.100- 23:59.340* :  in Hungary that's why we support him and because he might be able to encourage some of the
*23:59.340- 24:01.380* :  Hungarians who have left the country to come back
*24:13.160- 24:18.980* :  that report from Hungary by Nick Thorpe today marks the 35th anniversary of the
*24:18.980- 24:29.220* :  Shannonman Square massacre in Beijing it was on the 4th of June 1989 that Chinese soldiers
*24:29.700- 24:34.640* :  opened fire at the mainly young demonstrators who'd been protesting for weeks in the hugely
*24:34.640- 24:39.520* :  symbolic square right in front of the great hall of the people it's estimated that hundreds perhaps
*24:39.520- 24:45.800* :  thousands died the communist authorities in China have long sought to wipe the event from history
*24:46.460- 24:51.760* :  but Taiwan's new president William Lai said today that the massacre would never be forgotten
*24:52.520- 24:57.380* :  in Hong Kong the only place in China where public commemorations of the killings used to be held
*24:57.380- 25:03.140* :  security has been tightened on Monday police they're detained an artist after he made a tribute
*25:03.140- 25:08.860* :  to the demonstrators by writing the date in the air with his hand our China media analyst
*25:08.860- 25:13.480* :  Carrie Allen told me that despite the clampdown the anniversary would still be marked
*25:14.220- 25:18.140* :  there will be many people who will be marking the anniversary privately and one of the ways
*25:18.140- 25:24.060* :  that people do this in mainland China is by lighting candles so there'll be people in their homes
*25:24.060- 25:29.480* :  today who will be lighting a candle you will also see this in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan as
*25:29.500- 25:35.020* :  well there are places today where people can gather for a candlelit ceremony but in mainland China
*25:35.020- 25:40.180* :  there's very heavy censorship of this event every year to the extent that even the candle
*25:40.180- 25:45.500* :  emoji the little picture that you get on your phone is removed from social media platforms so
*25:45.500- 25:51.240* :  people can't post pictures of candles cakes for example birthday cakes that have candles on them
*25:51.240- 25:56.120* :  these are just completely removed from social media platforms so these very delicate ways of
*25:56.120- 26:00.620* :  trying to commemorate the event you won't see anything online but I have to stress people will
*26:00.620- 26:06.580* :  be marking this today privately in their homes we mentioned Taiwan the Taiwanese president speaking
*26:06.580- 26:10.320* :  out that's going to make him even less popular with the communist authorities and Beijing
*26:10.940- 26:15.940* :  indeed yes he said that we will continue to keep this historic memory alive so that was a very
*26:15.940- 26:22.100* :  strong message that he sent out today and he did reiterate that Taiwan firmly stands by the belief
*26:22.100- 26:27.160* :  that people only truly flourish with freedom and democracy and very much reiterated the point
*26:27.220- 26:32.980* :  that this event will be marked every year even though areas like Hong Kong are increasingly starting
*26:32.980- 26:39.680* :  to silence events that mark this anniversary and I guess the censors in China working over time
*26:39.680- 26:45.080* :  today very much so yes but scenes in Hong Kong particularly interesting a friend actually
*26:45.080- 26:50.160* :  message me just before I came on air to say that she's near Victoria Park an area where people
*26:50.500- 26:54.640* :  regularly have gathered over the years to mark the anniversary and she said the police
*26:54.640- 27:00.280* :  presence is extremely high because there is increased awareness about people marking this
*27:00.280- 27:05.800* :  event in public people have been encouraged to do so in private if at all our China media analyst
*27:05.800- 27:11.960* :  Kerry Allen now to a mystery surrounding three newborn babies abandoned here in London over the
*27:11.960- 27:18.400* :  past seven years the latest a baby girl just one hour old was found by a dog walker in a shopping
*27:18.400- 27:23.440* :  bag on a freezing night in January the BBC's Sancho Burg has been following the case in the
*27:23.440- 27:29.300* :  family courts and gained permission to report part of the proceedings the new information is that
*27:29.300- 27:34.460* :  baby Elsa as she was called by medical staff because she was so cold when she was found
*27:34.460- 27:41.560* :  they named her after the character in frozen baby Elsa DNA test show is a full sibling of two
*27:41.560- 27:50.660* :  other babies who were abandoned in East London in similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019 now the
*27:50.660- 27:57.400* :  police made extensive appeals for their mother to come forward at the time they had no leads they
*27:57.400- 28:04.420* :  have no leads currently in the case of baby Elsa either and it is very unusual for one baby to be
*28:04.420- 28:10.560* :  abandoned judge Carol Atkinson said it would be of enormous public interest to make public the fact
*28:10.560- 28:16.480* :  that three babies had been abandoned by the same parents all the babies are well and the names that
*28:16.680- 28:21.880* :  they were given at birth have now been changed they're not known by those names the two older babies
*28:21.880- 28:27.980* :  have been adopted and it does raise lots of questions because as the judge said it is very very
*28:27.980- 28:34.160* :  unusual for three babies to be abandoned by the same parents does make you ask what kind of
*28:34.160- 28:40.920* :  circumstances is the mother in and we argued that reporting this information could help find the
*28:40.920- 28:47.660* :  mother and provide the help that she may need the first baby was found in September 2017 in
*28:48.700- 28:55.640* :  and the second baby in January 2019 the first was a little boy the second a little girl it's been a
*28:55.640- 29:02.660* :  very long time releasing this information and the judge supported this could help find the parents
*29:02.660- 29:08.880* :  because it is an exceptional case more reminiscent of the 19th century than modern Britain
*29:08.880- 29:14.780* :  Sancho Berg reporting one of Tyler and's most wanted fugitives has been extradited from
*29:14.780- 29:20.080* :  Indonesia to face murder and drugs charges in his home country after escaping from custody last
*29:20.080- 29:25.880* :  year Chowelit Thong Duang was arrested by police on the Indonesian island of Bali last week
*29:26.580- 29:32.020* :  in return for his extradition Indonesian police want help in capturing one of their own most wanted
*29:32.020- 29:37.200* :  criminals thought to be hiding in Thailand's forests I heard more of my Asia Pacific Regional
*29:37.200- 29:46.220* :  Cecilia Hutton Chowelit Thong Duang was arrested in Bali after a really high profile escape from a
*29:46.220- 29:51.220* :  Thai prison he was actually in a hospital he was supposed to be getting a dental having a
*29:51.220- 29:57.180* :  dental appointment he was handcuffed to a bed and somehow managed to escape into mountains escape
*29:57.180- 30:03.920* :  to shoot out with Thai police made his way to India admitted to police later that he was worried
*30:03.920- 30:08.260* :  he would be caught in India and wanted to make his way to Indonesia where he thought he'd
*30:08.260- 30:14.300* :  blend in a little bit better he fled by speedboat to Indonesia that's where he was caught by the
*30:14.300- 30:21.040* :  Indonesian police so he's now thought to be back on Thai soil he was escorted amid tight security
*30:21.040- 30:27.580* :  by Indonesian police back into Thailand today and they're taking him back but that's not the end
*30:27.580- 30:31.680* :  of the story because they want one of their own who they think is in Thailand that's right so the
*30:31.680- 30:37.120* :  Indonesian police are being very clear that because they are helping out Thailand they want the
*30:37.120- 30:43.200* :  Thai police to do more to track down somebody named Freddie Pratama who they have wanted for 10
*30:43.200- 30:49.500* :  years now who's thought to be hiding in the dense jungle near Myanmar that in northern Thailand
*30:49.500- 30:55.340* :  now more than 800 people from Freddie Pratama's drug network have already been arrested
*30:55.340- 31:01.040* :  a he's thought to be responsible for a huge drug network that extends from Thailand and Myanmar
*31:01.040- 31:06.340* :  all the way down through Southeast Asia and the Indonesian police are being very clear
*31:06.340- 31:13.500* :  that they want more help in tracking down Freddie Pratama yeah and tell us more about the industry
*31:13.500- 31:19.100* :  that he's involved in this synthetic drugs trade well there's been an explosion the United
*31:19.100- 31:26.520* :  Nations says in synthetic drug production and trafficking mostly drugs that are being made things
*31:26.520- 31:32.580* :  like methamphetamine ecstasy pills that are being made in Myanmar which is dealing with its own
*31:32.580- 31:38.360* :  troubles a civil war at the moment and those things are being made in Myanmar and traffic through
*31:38.360- 31:44.200* :  Thailand and into the rest of Southeast Asia you and officials tell me that they have never seen
*31:44.200- 31:50.280* :  such a high level a record amount of drugs being seized and they're worried that that's just the
*31:50.280- 31:53.600* :  tip of the iceberg when it comes to synthetic drug production and trafficking.
*31:54.120- 31:59.820* :  Our Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton. As the music festival season gets underway in Europe and
*31:59.820- 32:05.520* :  the US it's emerged that dozens of events featuring newer artists are having to be cancelled because
*32:05.520- 32:11.660* :  of financial problems by contrast events with headline acts from the 80s 90s and 90s seem to be
*32:11.660- 32:18.180* :  doing as well as ever but why? Music journalist Lisa Veriko spoke to James Kumara Sami.
*32:18.920- 32:23.380* :  We're living in an Europe nostalgia in music everybody loves all music we're not just talking
*32:23.380- 32:28.800* :  old people who originally listened to that music but crossroads with the time when festivals are
*32:28.880- 32:35.240* :  struggling so the latest news is that 45 UK festivals are cancelled to postpone this year and people
*32:35.240- 32:41.000* :  reckons will be 70 by the summer so something is happening at regular festivals whereas the kind
*32:41.000- 32:46.140* :  of retro festivals which are aimed at older people with more disposable income they're thriving.
*32:46.560- 32:49.840* :  And what about the other side of it some of the big acts saying look it's not really
*32:50.180- 32:55.680* :  worth going to the festivals anymore we have our big world tours and the festivals don't necessarily
*32:55.680- 33:01.420* :  fit into it whereas perhaps some of the older nostalgia bands are much happier to go along with
*33:01.420- 33:07.660* :  the festival scene. Definitely so your big stars are touring much much more big artists or brands
*33:07.720- 33:14.220* :  what have a lot of control over where they're seen what they do the staging so they're not that
*33:15.520- 33:21.400* :  it's not just festivals erm understand you went on an 80s cruise. I did go on an 80s cruise as well
*33:21.560- 33:28.760* :  the first 80s kind of event I went to and that was in 2002 here and now Kim Wilde was on that and
*33:28.760- 33:43.340* :  I was a massive Kim Wilde fan when I was a kid. It culture club recastly and then in 2018 I went
*33:43.340- 33:50.080* :  on a UK's first 80s cruise I spoke to a lot of people on that cruise and they said you know we used
*33:50.080- 33:54.160* :  to go to gigs all the time but we don't live in a big city now we can't be afford to go and get
*33:54.160- 33:59.740* :  childmenders or whatever and people say I've seen more gigs in the last two days that I've seen
*33:59.740- 34:04.600* :  in the last 25 years this is a thing about the festivals you get to see all these acts that you love
*34:04.600- 34:09.620* :  you can sing along to the remainder of your youth I would say that you used to say with artists
*34:09.620- 34:14.020* :  they would have their time and then they would go away but they just stick around now and there's
*34:14.120- 34:18.280* :  not just the people that used to love them when they grew up with them but young people love
*34:18.280- 34:23.580* :  them as well now so you're definitely on to a winner. Yes I guess running up that hill became big
*34:23.580- 34:28.300* :  when a stranger things came out and you have Sophia Lisbeckster's murder on the dance floor recently
*34:28.300- 34:34.220* :  as well how much is it TV shows that have driven some of this nostalgia? I think it's much more
*34:34.220- 34:40.080* :  streaming I mean dreams by Fleetwood Mac took off on TikTok Fleetwood Mac were already huge you go
*34:40.080- 34:44.940* :  to festivals and lots of cover bands playing Fleetwood Mac and DJs playing at night that's a thing
*34:44.940- 34:57.480* :  that's been building for a long time. I think TikTok is more of the moment but streaming definitely
*34:57.480- 35:02.300* :  I mean you've got all music at your fingertips and if you're listening to song for the first time
*35:02.300- 35:08.900* :  it's new to you so you might be hearing the real Slim Shady for the first time that's new song to you
*35:09.080- 35:16.140* :  so I don't think that young people distinguish so much between old acts or old music and music it's
*35:22.220- 35:27.160* :  just new to them music journalist Lisa Verico on the popularity of nostalgia music festivals
