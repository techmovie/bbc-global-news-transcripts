*00:18.200- 00:20.720* :  Did you know cats tend to hide symptoms of sickness and pain?
*00:20.720- 00:23.480* :  I learned this the hard way after losing my cat, Genji.
*00:23.640- 00:28.240* :  So I created Pretty Letter, a health monitoring litter that helps detect early signs of illness

*01:24.640- 01:28.960* :  I'm Andrew Peechner at 13 hours GMT on Friday, the 21st of June.
*01:28.960- 01:30.440* :  These are our main stories.
*01:31.040- 01:36.200* :  Kenyan police are accused of using excessive force to disperse mass demonstrations over
*01:36.200- 01:37.440* :  proposed tax hikes.
*01:38.100- 01:43.340* :  As the US military resumes aid deliveries from its peer off the coast of Gaza, doctors say
*01:43.340- 01:47.920* :  severe dehydration and malnutrition are a growing concern among children.
*01:48.660- 01:53.480* :  Reports of southern China have once in a century flooding while the north is hit by extreme
*01:53.480- 01:54.720* :  temperatures and drought.
*01:56.820- 02:01.360* :  Also in this podcast, how wild chimpanzees seek out medicinal plants.
*02:01.860- 02:05.420* :  We sent them to a lab in Germany and we tested for their medicinal properties.
*02:05.720- 02:12.100* :  88% of them had strong antibacterial properties and 33% had strong anti-inflammatory properties.
*02:12.520- 02:17.200* :  And a world first conference on how menstruation and the menopause are linked with mental health.
*02:20.200- 02:24.540* :  This time yesterday on the Global News Podcast, we were reporting on a tense situation in
*02:24.540- 02:30.640* :  the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, during big protests, mainly by young people, against proposed tax increases.
*02:31.340- 02:35.780* :  Today, the authorities are investigating reports that a protest was fatally shot by police
*02:35.780- 02:37.100* :  during those demonstrations.
*02:37.840- 02:42.200* :  Lobby groups have said at least 200 people were injured across the country and accused the
*02:42.200- 02:44.180* :  police of using excessive force.
*02:44.580- 02:47.680* :  Let's hear from Nairobi and our correspondent there, Mercy Juma.
*02:48.040- 02:53.740* :  I was actually one of the reporters who were in the Nairobi CBD covering this protest and have
*02:53.740- 02:56.300* :  covered many protests that have never seen anything like this.
*02:56.300- 03:01.560* :  There were tens of thousands of people on the street, young people, but they were very peaceful.
*03:02.020- 03:03.400* :  In my opinion, I'm from where I stood.
*03:03.400- 03:04.500* :  Nobody was throwing stones.
*03:04.500- 03:08.220* :  Yes, they were being repelled by the police, but they were moving away and then they kept
*03:08.220- 03:08.880* :  coming back.
*03:08.880- 03:13.640* :  It was a bit of a cushion pull between them and the police, but when evening junior and
*03:13.640- 03:18.620* :  these contentious people, they are protesting against, were passed through the second reading,
*03:18.620- 03:23.280* :  and now it's waiting to do the third reading, that's where they became a bit angry, but still
*03:23.280- 03:28.800* :  not being violent, but as darkness came, police became a bit more aggressive and we started
*03:28.800- 03:33.400* :  hearing reports of people being shot at, people being physically abused by the police.
*03:33.800- 03:38.760* :  And now we are, we confirm that one person has died, so many people have been injured and
*03:38.760- 03:41.200* :  those who have been arrested and a couple who are still missing.
*03:41.380- 03:46.640* :  Because we're questioning yesterday the use of riot police, police on horseback, water cannon,
*03:47.020- 03:51.460* :  and asking whether that was disproportionate to the protest that was there.
*03:52.140- 03:56.900* :  And what Anne had to say about it was that that's just how the Kenyan police operate when they're
*03:56.900- 03:58.640* :  trying to disperse a protest.
*03:59.020- 04:03.140* :  Unfortunately, yes, that's the Kenyan police for you, that's how they operate,
*04:03.960- 04:08.020* :  but it was really disproportionate because, keeping in mind, the kind of crowd that they were
*04:08.020- 04:14.500* :  dealing with. The people that were on the street were 18, 19, 20, 25-year-olds, I won't say a
*04:14.500- 04:19.060* :  couple of 30-year-olds, but most of them were just children, so basically they were fighting
*04:19.060- 04:23.040* :  children, but unfortunately children who are very knowledgeable about what they want,
*04:23.420- 04:27.740* :  about the kind of feature they want, and they were doing all this when these young people were
*04:27.740- 04:32.060* :  live streaming, so that's also the other nature that the protest took. The young people had their
*04:32.060- 04:35.480* :  phones, they were live streaming their protest, they were outright hearing their demands,
*04:35.480- 04:39.940* :  but unfortunately this was received so much force from the security forces.
*04:40.360- 04:45.880* :  So, we're now promised an investigation, and no doubt there'll be more protests, because the
*04:45.880- 04:49.700* :  bill's been passed, the issue hasn't gone away, the protesters aren't going to go away.
*04:49.900- 04:53.620* :  No, they're not going to go away, so the independent policing oversight authority that is
*04:53.620- 04:58.380* :  like poor, and this is the authority of the body that monitors and investigates all policing
*04:58.380- 05:03.120* :  operations affecting members of the public, as it is going to investigate these, that just doesn't
*05:03.460- 05:07.960* :  mean, Canadians and these young people are sitting and waiting. They have actually just released
*05:07.960- 05:13.400* :  a few minutes ago, a seven-day, what they called seven days of courage, that they're starting
*05:13.400- 05:18.580* :  this afternoon, so they're going to join Muslims for prayers this afternoon, and then tomorrow
*05:18.580- 05:25.220* :  at the entertainment joins, they are planning to have a moment of silence and shout anti-governments
*05:25.220- 05:32.020* :  and anti-President William Ruto Chans, and then they're planning for two major protests on Tuesday
*05:32.020- 05:36.780* :  next week, when parliament is supposed to vote on this bill, and then on Thursday,
*05:37.160- 05:40.640* :  as they wait for the President to either ascend to this bill or send it back to parliament,
*05:40.640- 05:44.900* :  so it will go, it is going to be a very busy next couple of days for the country.
*05:45.340- 05:51.140* :  A correspondent, Mercy Juma, with me from Nairobi. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is getting
*05:51.140- 05:56.800* :  worse, as the war continues between Israel and Hamas. The UN says around a million people are
*05:56.800- 06:02.400* :  set to face the highest levels of starvation by mid-July. Amid soaring temperatures and a lack
*06:02.400- 06:08.640* :  of clean water, doctors say severe dehydration, malnutrition and disease are a growing concern,
*06:09.280- 06:13.680* :  especially among young children. Against that backdrop, the US says it's re-established a
*06:13.680- 06:18.780* :  temporary peer constructed by its military, allowing a resumption of aid deliveries. Our
*06:18.780- 06:23.400* :  correspondent John Dollison is in Jerusalem. I asked John whether the re-establishment of the
*06:23.400- 06:29.780* :  US peer to deliver aid into Gaza by sea would make any difference. The peer has been
*06:29.780- 06:35.780* :  beset by problems really since it opened a month ago. It cost $230 million to build,
*06:35.880- 06:40.240* :  but it's thought it's only really been operational for about 10 days over the past month.
*06:40.840- 06:45.660* :  It was closed down last week because of rough seas. Well, it's now up and running again,
*06:45.720- 06:53.760* :  and the US Central Command says some 6,000 metric tons of aid were delivered by the peer
*06:54.000- 07:00.500* :  yesterday. Aid agencies, though, still say that by far the most efficient and effective way to
*07:00.500- 07:07.360* :  get aid in would be for Israel to open up more land-crossing. Israel insists that it is allowing
*07:07.360- 07:13.840* :  200 trucks a day, roughly, through the Kerimchellon crossing into southern Gaza, but the aid agencies
*07:14.320- 07:19.640* :  face problems with getting to that aid, one because of the continued fighting in southern Gaza,
*07:20.040- 07:25.080* :  and also now such as the level of desperation amongst Garzans, that there is a real problem
*07:25.080- 07:30.060* :  with the aid trucks being looted once they get into Gaza, often by armed government.
*07:31.200- 07:37.400* :  And it doesn't look like there's going to be any great shift in terms of Israel, suddenly allowing
*07:37.400- 07:44.080* :  a lot more aid to be delivered by land for all sorts of reasons. How immediate the need for that aid
*07:44.080- 07:52.600* :  is? Yeah, it is immediate. I mean, it's hot here, nearly 40 degrees down in Gaza, certainly high
*07:52.600- 07:58.280* :  30s, and with many people living in tents, you can only imagine how sweltering they get throughout
*07:58.280- 08:03.420* :  the day. Now, I don't know how much water you're meant to drink a day, but I'd say in hot conditions
*08:03.500- 08:10.000* :  at least a liter, probably two liters, and people simply aren't getting it. And what water there is
*08:10.000- 08:16.680* :  often is contaminated, and then people, especially young children, end up with gastric infections,
*08:17.600- 08:24.880* :  diarrhea, chronic dehydration, losing lots and lots of weight. So yeah, the hospitals already
*08:24.880- 08:31.540* :  dealing with a large number of injured people, and now facing people with malnutrition and severe
*08:31.540- 08:38.100* :  dehydration. A correspondent, John Dawson, in Jerusalem. Officials in North West Pakistan have
*08:38.100- 08:43.700* :  deployed additional security forces after a tourist accused of blasphemy was killed by a mob.
*08:43.700- 08:48.860* :  The crowd attacked a police station and seized the man, killing him, and setting fire to his body
*08:48.860- 08:54.620* :  on Thursday. Here's our South Asia editor and Barrison Etherargin. The victim was staying in a hotel
*08:54.620- 09:01.280* :  in Madhyaan, a town in Pakistan's Kaibar Pakhtunkoa province, when some locals accused him of blasphemy.
*09:01.280- 09:07.520* :  The police intervened, rescuing him and taking him to the local office. But reports said the crowd
*09:07.520- 09:14.020* :  converged on the station, pelting officers with stones, dragging the man out and beating him to death.
*09:14.600- 09:19.980* :  Several people were injured in the violence. The situation is reported to be tense with protesters
*09:19.980- 09:25.640* :  blocking the main road. Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Muslim majority Pakistan,
*09:26.240- 09:32.600* :  where even accusations of without evidence can stir up anger among crowds, leading to lynchings.
*09:33.560- 09:35.720* :  Next, to the forests of Uganda.
*09:41.740- 09:46.900* :  It's the sound of wild chimpanzees playing. They were recorded by scientists from Oxford
*09:47.640- 09:52.500* :  University who are staying to investigate how these primates use certain plants to self-medicate
*09:52.500- 09:57.660* :  when they're ill or in pain. My colleague, Michelle Hussain, spoke to the lead researcher of the
*09:57.660- 10:02.280* :  Projects, Dr. Elodie Freeman. I lived in the Badongo forest for a total of around eight months,
*10:02.280- 10:06.920* :  and I was watching carefully what the chimps were eating and doing, and I was also taking
*10:06.980- 10:12.760* :  health data to see if they were suffering from any sort of bacterial infection or parasite
*10:12.760- 10:17.760* :  load, or if they had any sort of injuries or wounds. And then I would look at what they ate,
*10:17.760- 10:22.160* :  carefully in their diet, and select any resources or plants that it looked like they were
*10:22.760- 10:26.640* :  going out of their way to collect or if they were rare or unusual in some way.
*10:26.900- 10:31.020* :  And were they? Yeah, well, so that was what was super exciting about this project, was that
*10:31.020- 10:35.080* :  we got the opportunity to then take those plant samples. We took 13 different species,
*10:35.480- 10:39.240* :  and we sent them to a lab in Germany, and we tested for their medicinal properties,
*10:39.540- 10:46.100* :  and we found that 88% of them had strong antibacterial properties, and 33% had strong anti-inflammatory
*10:46.100- 10:52.940* :  properties. Were these plants known for that, or were they plants that were new to researchers like
*10:52.940- 10:57.560* :  you or to the pharmaceutical industry? It's a great question. Many of them are new.
*10:57.560- 11:03.100* :  Most of them have never before been proposed as a medicine for the chimpanzees, so our research
*11:03.580- 11:08.420* :  vastly expands what we know or what we think we know about the chimpanzee medicinal repertoire.
*11:09.300- 11:13.280* :  So tell me more about exactly what you observe. So is it, I don't know, do chimps do things like
*11:13.280- 11:17.760* :  clutch their stomach or look like they have a stomach ache, and then do they go for a certain plant
*11:17.800- 11:21.740* :  and appear to get better after eating it? Sometimes it's very clear that the chimpanzee
*11:21.740- 11:26.060* :  is suffering from something. They might, I mean, chimps like us will sneeze or cough if they
*11:26.060- 11:29.580* :  have a respiratory infection, but other times we had to use other sort of non-invasive
*11:30.120- 11:36.140* :  health monitoring methods like taking samples and seeing if they tested for any sort of abnormal
*11:36.140- 11:41.600* :  metrics like if they had a bacterial infection. We were quantifying how many parasites we found
*11:41.600- 11:46.060* :  in their samples, and then to get a sense of what they were eating, we looked at plants that,
*11:46.060- 11:50.600* :  again, we're not normal part of their diet chimps will avoid eating things that are unusual to
*11:50.600- 11:56.740* :  them. Usually they're quite the word is neophobic, scared of new foods. So in these cases where they
*11:56.740- 12:01.000* :  would seek out unusual foods, especially when they were sick or wounded, it raised a lot of alarm bells
*12:01.000- 12:06.660* :  for us. And did the plants generally work? Was it the case that without intervention from people
*12:06.660- 12:11.340* :  like you, a chimpanzee could be cured of their infection through a plant that they ate in the forest?
*12:12.140- 12:16.540* :  Yeah, so in all cases, the chimps that we found were suffering from some sort of illness or wound
*12:16.540- 12:21.840* :  did recover. It's hard to, you know, 100 percent pinpoint that and attribute it to the plant that
*12:21.840- 12:26.300* :  they were eating, but every single trim showed a fast recovery after eating these plants.
*12:27.020- 12:32.480* :  Dr. L. D. Freeman from Oxford University. In the UK, there's a big conference taking place on a
*12:32.480- 12:37.120* :  subject that directly affects half the world's population, menstrual health and the menopause.
*12:37.700- 12:41.900* :  It's bringing together international experts from a range of academic disciplines, including
*12:41.900- 12:47.560* :  psychology, medicine, policy studies and law. The aim is to research an area which some say is
*12:47.560- 12:52.560* :  still underfunded and poorly understood. The organiser, Professor Gemma Sharp from the University
*12:52.560- 12:57.740* :  of Exeter, told us why she set the conference up. The field in general has been historically
*12:57.740- 13:04.140* :  very underfunded and people were working on menstrual health and on mental health and on
*13:04.140- 13:09.420* :  menopausal health, but in silos, so they were working, thinking from their own perspectives,
*13:09.480- 13:15.580* :  their own, using their own skills. We didn't really have a community, so when I came to the
*13:15.580- 13:20.180* :  research field, that was the issue that I saw and so I just started reaching out to different
*13:20.180- 13:24.660* :  people that I knew were working in these areas and it just kind of snowballed from there.
*13:25.140- 13:30.660* :  So now we're all brought together so that we can share those perspectives and collaborate on
*13:30.660- 13:37.300* :  projects, but not just academics, but also bringing in non-academics as well, who are actually
*13:37.760- 13:42.760* :  more working on the ground with women and people who menstruate so that we can get our research
*13:42.760- 13:47.880* :  findings out there and they can actually have an impact and improve the lives of those people.
*13:48.360- 13:54.080* :  And there's a lot of research around the timing of menopause again and menopausal experiences,
*13:54.660- 13:58.820* :  but then in between we don't really think about menstruation, it's just not something that
*13:59.140- 14:04.900* :  that people have been researching that much. So now it's really great to see people looking at that
*14:04.900- 14:09.440* :  a little bit more looking at menstruation in the workplace, etc. And that's one of the themes
*14:09.540- 14:13.600* :  that has come out from the conference, I think, is that we really need to take this life course
*14:13.600- 14:19.460* :  approach to think about these things throughout the whole reproductive life course. We had a really
*14:19.460- 14:25.360* :  fascinating panel discussion and we were discussing what the problems and the reasons that we haven't
*14:25.360- 14:29.840* :  been having this joined up thinking. And essentially we've just not been talking to each other,
*14:29.840- 14:35.920* :  so it's been really great to get everybody all in the room at the same time. So we had people
*14:35.920- 14:41.900* :  like from the Femtec company, Clou, people from the charity well-being of women. And they were
*14:41.900- 14:45.940* :  saying it's been incredible to see all of the research going on in this area. We didn't know
*14:45.940- 14:50.100* :  that this was happening. And then on our side we're kind of saying, well we're doing all this
*14:50.100- 14:54.400* :  research and we don't know how to get our findings out there, but I think why it's been underfunded,
*14:54.840- 15:00.380* :  is the huge amount of stigma around just talking about menstrual health. Another thing that's come
*15:00.380- 15:05.360* :  out of the conference is we're all united in knowing that we need to break down those barriers
*15:05.360- 15:11.100* :  and that stigma. One thing that I think we agree on is that the education would be a really good
*15:11.100- 15:17.580* :  place to start with that and just normalising menstruation so that people from a really young age
*15:17.580- 15:25.160* :  even pre-m menstruation boys and girls understand that this is a kind of normal process and just
*15:25.160- 15:31.760* :  removing that like embarrassing squeamish nature attached to it. Professor of Slingology, Gemma Sharp.

*17:03.900- 17:08.920* :  The Eukenian Brigade has been redeployed to help defend the strategic eastern town of Chasivya
*17:08.920- 17:13.780* :  from a conservative Russian assault says fighting there has become extremely difficult.
*17:13.780- 17:16.980* :  It said Russia's army was trying to encircle the town.
*17:17.420- 17:18.780* :  Jean McKenzie is in Kiev.
*17:19.340- 17:24.900* :  If the Russians can successfully capture Chasivya, which is strategically located on top of a hill,
*17:24.900- 17:30.700* :  it would put a number of key Ukrainian cities within sight and make it easier for Russia to push
*17:30.700- 17:36.620* :  forward and achieve one of its main aims of this war. So occupy the entire region of Donetsk.
*17:37.100- 17:42.040* :  Units from Ukraine's 24th separate mechanized brigade that have been redeployed to the town
*17:42.040- 17:46.860* :  said Russian forces were trying to encircle it, attacking it from the north and south.
*17:47.400- 17:51.620* :  But up in the northeast of Ukraine, the situation around the city of Harkiv has stabilized
*17:52.160- 17:54.720* :  after Russian troops crossed the border in May.
*17:55.760- 18:00.220* :  The Chinese authorities have called it a once-in-a-century event as tarantial rain
*18:00.220- 18:05.520* :  causes flash flooding and mudslides in the south. Tens of thousands of people have had to leave
*18:05.520- 18:10.460* :  their homes. Several have been killed. More heavy rain is expected in the coming days.
*18:10.980- 18:14.300* :  I've been talking to our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton.
*18:14.780- 18:20.340* :  Flooding is no big deal in southern China. It happens every year. There's an annual flooding season
*18:20.340- 18:27.180* :  when we get monsoon rains. Now, what's key here is that the government is saying this is a historic
*18:27.220- 18:33.260* :  moment. We are seeing, for example, in the province of Guangdong, the most populist province in China.
*18:33.260- 18:40.800* :  127 million people live there. The same population as Japan has, for example. So a lot of China's
*18:40.960- 18:46.240* :  economy is focused down in that province as well. They are experiencing floodwaters. They have
*18:46.240- 18:52.400* :  never ever seen before. So rivers bursting their banks on the scale they've never experienced
*18:52.400- 18:57.340* :  before. And that's causing some jaw-dropping images. I was looking at some videos today.
*18:57.340- 19:02.760* :  Some towns and villages look like they've been hit by earthquakes. The heavy rain has been
*19:02.760- 19:09.360* :  so hard, so many buildings damaged, toppled over. We've seen videos where bridges have been
*19:09.360- 19:16.980* :  just pushed over by the force of water running through rivers, landslides, just collapsing at
*19:16.980- 19:22.440* :  on top of highways. So even though the authorities there are used to dealing with floods, the people
*19:22.440- 19:26.540* :  there are well used to dealing with floods at this time of year, this is something that they have
*19:26.540- 19:30.440* :  not experienced. And the infrastructure obviously can't cope. Perhaps no infrastructure could cope
*19:30.440- 19:35.060* :  with what you're describing, but anything that's beyond normal boundaries is the challenge in any
*19:35.060- 19:39.500* :  part of the world. That's exactly right. And you're also just seeing people just experiencing
*19:39.500- 19:47.040* :  misery on a really human level, you know, waiting through knee-deep mud, or you're seeing people
*19:47.040- 19:52.560* :  waiting through chest high water, holding their children above them. You know, so I will say the
*19:52.560- 19:57.980* :  authorities, I think, are quite happy that they've been able to prevent math deaths so far. So we've
*19:57.980- 20:04.500* :  had nine dead in the past week, six are still missing, particularly around the major city area
*20:04.500- 20:09.640* :  in Guangdong. But compare that to back in 1998 when we had more than four thousand deaths
*20:10.020- 20:15.500* :  in a flooding season. So I think on that scale, the authorities have done quite well to move people
*20:15.500- 20:20.360* :  to higher ground, but still the depth of the destruction here, around five hundred million
*20:20.360- 20:24.900* :  dollars worth of damage just in the past couple of months alone. And meanwhile in northern China,
*20:24.900- 20:29.800* :  there's other extreme weather with very high temperatures at the moment. Yeah, this is a tale of
*20:29.800- 20:35.080* :  two extremes. So flooding in the south, in the north, we have farmers worrying that they're going
*20:35.080- 20:40.220* :  to have a complete crop failure this year with rice patties, the things that have been planted
*20:40.220- 20:44.560* :  are failing. Other crops haven't even been planted yet because there's just not enough water.
*20:45.000- 20:51.740* :  The north is experiencing continuous heat wave and drought. So even again, when in a place where
*20:51.740- 20:56.420* :  they're used to not experiencing rain for long periods of time, they're developing things like
*20:56.420- 21:00.940* :  genetically modified wheat and rice. They're worried that they'll have complete crop failure
*21:00.940- 21:06.000* :  this year. Celia Hatton reporting, we're just over a week away from the first round of voting in
*21:06.000- 21:11.340* :  France's snap election, caught by Emmanuel Macron after his party was trounced by the far-right
*21:11.340- 21:16.860* :  national rally in European elections earlier this month. President Macron is hoping the vote will
*21:16.860- 21:21.700* :  give him a majority in parliament. The omens for that are not looking good though. Our correspondent
*21:21.700- 21:27.060* :  Hugh Scofield has been the president's home town, Amir, which is 100 miles north of Paris,
*21:27.440- 21:35.040* :  to sample opinion there. Okay, here we are. Now, today we've decided for once not to do the
*21:35.040- 21:38.880* :  classic thing, which is to go to a picturesque, lovely market in the middle of town, but to come
*21:38.880- 21:44.080* :  here on the outside of town, an ugly shopping commercial center, hundreds of people around,
*21:44.260- 21:47.900* :  because this is actually where most ordinary people do their shopping.
*21:52.180- 21:58.120* :  All I know is that today the national rally is a party just like any other. It's a party that says
*21:58.120- 22:03.820* :  it is for the French, and which tries to do the maximum for the French, and we need it because
*22:03.820- 22:11.040* :  frankly, right now we're at rock bottom. France is a mess, immigration, cost of living,
*22:11.040- 22:15.900* :  nothing works, and it keeps going further down here. Things can't get any worse than the way
*22:15.900- 22:20.180* :  they are, so now is the moment to do something I have never done before and vote for the national
*22:25.320- 22:29.920* :  rally. Yes, sure, in the past, the old national front was scary. They were racist or whatever,
*22:30.660- 22:35.840* :  but things have totally changed. They're not like that at all now. If you ask me, the far left is
*22:35.840- 22:44.080* :  more racist and more fascist than the national rally. The local MEP for Amir was until two weeks ago
*22:44.400- 22:50.540* :  Patricia Chanier of the national rally. Now she's running parliament in the elections which are
*22:50.540- 22:55.960* :  coming up. One of those rare characters at the RN who actually speaks fluent English, she's not
*22:55.960- 23:02.620* :  at all surprised by the big swing to her party here. They should not be abullied by the EU who is
*23:02.620- 23:08.760* :  trying to oppose regulations on them. They should not be abullied by the extreme left who wants to
*23:08.760- 23:14.440* :  totally open the French borders to everyone. They shouldn't be abullied by extreme liberalism.
*23:14.820- 23:21.860* :  Our country has come to a grinding halt and we represent the party who wants to prove who is
*23:21.860- 23:27.880* :  going to put France back on its rails. If the move towards the national rally is born out,
*23:28.160- 23:34.460* :  then France is heading into completely unknown territory with President Macron somehow having to
*23:34.460- 23:40.660* :  cooperate with a prime minister from the far right. For a political scientist, Bruno Cortres
*23:40.660- 23:48.780* :  is a recipe for instability. If Macron first lose the election, second, that the consequence is
*23:48.780- 23:54.120* :  that we have a climate parliament, many people are going to ask, Macron, you should resign.
*23:54.120- 24:00.640* :  Macron clearly said, I want resign, but we should be in a situation where in the beginning,
*24:00.640- 24:07.960* :  so the middle of July, it would be the Macron mandate, which is really on the front of the
*24:07.960- 24:16.500* :  discussion. Increasingly, here in France, it feels like the Macron era is coming to a close.
*24:17.160- 24:21.140* :  It's thinking about what's going to come after that's making people very nervous.
*24:22.760- 24:28.180* :  Uncorrespondent Hustgo Field. Hawaii has announced it'll remove carbon emissions from its
*24:28.180- 24:34.580* :  transport system by 2045 in order to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of young people,
*24:34.960- 24:39.960* :  the details from Matt McGraw. Hawaii is one of the most progressive states in the US on climate
*24:39.960- 24:47.040* :  change, with 2045 the legal goal for reaching net zero carbon emissions. Despite this, the production
*24:47.040- 24:53.680* :  of planet warming gases in the state has been rising, going up 16% between 2020 and 2021.
*24:54.340- 24:58.220* :  Concerned by this trend, a group of 13 young people brought a case,
*24:58.700- 25:03.600* :  alleging the state's focus on building roads was boosting carbon and harming their right to a
*25:03.600- 25:09.160* :  clean and healthy environment. The state has now agreed to settle the case and to fully decarbonise
*25:09.160- 25:14.900* :  the transport system by 2045. The Italian former football star Roberto Baggio was taken
*25:14.900- 25:20.080* :  hospital on Thursday after armed robbers broke into his family home while he was watching the
*25:20.080- 25:25.780* :  Euros on television. Baggio, nicknamed the divine ponytail, was at one time the world's most
*25:25.780- 25:30.620* :  expensive football player. A Europe regional editor Danny Aberhard told me more.
*25:31.020- 25:35.260* :  Roberto Baggio was watching with his family. We don't know which of his wife and kids were there
*25:35.260- 25:40.800* :  at this stage when five armed men were said to have broken into his house. He now lives on
*25:40.800- 25:46.560* :  in a country villa surrounded by farmland and countryside in the northeast of Italy. According
*25:46.560- 25:53.200* :  to reports he tried to resist but was bashed on the head on the forehead with the butt of a gun
*25:53.900- 26:00.960* :  and then he was locked in a room with his family while the gang raided his house. Apparently
*26:00.960- 26:06.180* :  they've stole watchies jewelry and cash and then when he was sure that the gang had left he
*26:06.180- 26:11.740* :  broke down the door and alerted the police himself. He was taken to hospital and treated given
*26:11.800- 26:16.600* :  stitches in the head wound and has since been out and has been helping police with their
*26:16.600- 26:24.040* :  investigations. This is huge news in Italy because he was a huge football star. He absolutely was not
*26:24.040- 26:30.560* :  just in Italy. He was a world star. He won the ballon door for the world's best player in 1993. He was
*26:30.560- 26:35.700* :  the world's most expensive footballer as he mentioned when he was sold to Juventus. He played for a
*26:35.700- 26:41.040* :  number of very important Italian clubs also clubs like AC Milan into Milan for your auntina
*26:41.300- 26:48.440* :  and he represented Italy more than 50 times so it's one of Italy's best goal scorers. He scored one
*26:48.440- 26:54.180* :  of the World Cup's best ever goals in 1990 against Czechoslovakia, a wonderful mazi run from near
*26:54.180- 26:59.940* :  the halfway line but sadly although in 1994 though he dragged Italy to the World Cup final against
*26:59.940- 27:06.100* :  Brazil that year he's perhaps best remembered for missing the decisive penalty blazing it over the
*27:06.100- 27:12.220* :  bar which is very sad but beyond his footballing achievements he's recognised for his humanitarian
*27:12.220- 27:17.260* :  work. You mentioned his nickname there the Divine Ponytail. It was partly for his distinctive
*27:17.260- 27:23.040* :  plattive ponytail that people would recognise in the 1990s but also for the fact he adhered to
*27:23.040- 27:29.900* :  Buddhism in a country that was still very much largely Roman Catholic and he has won a man of peace
*27:29.900- 27:36.380* :  award from Nobel Peace Prize laureates for his humanitarian work he also worked as an ambassador
*27:36.840- 27:42.620* :  Goodwill Ambassador for the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation so a guy with lots of credit in
*27:42.620- 27:47.180* :  the bank in terms of the Italian public and wider international humanitarian organisations.
*27:47.820- 27:52.840* :  You're a regional editor Danny Eberhard. Now to end this edition of the Global News podcast
*28:02.120- 28:07.000* :  that's the sound of thousands of people watching the sunrise earlier today over the
*28:07.000- 28:11.700* :  ancient standing stones at Stonehenge in southwest England they were marking the
*28:11.700- 28:15.660* :  summer solstice the longest period of daylight in the northern hemisphere
*28:16.240- 28:20.220* :  and joining those gathered at Stonehenge was my colleague Matt Taylor from BBC Weather.
*28:20.540- 28:27.800* :  They all started last night with the sunset a big event that was followed on by music dancing
*28:27.800- 28:31.840* :  huge amount of spirituality to take you through the night and into the morning as well but the
*28:31.840- 28:37.660* :  real pinnacle was this morning just after Tentafive here in the UK in which the sun rose and
*28:37.660- 28:44.720* :  shone into the centre of the stones now the stones are a very important element to this of course
*28:44.720- 28:50.680* :  and tell me a little bit more I'm joined by Kate Logan she is the historic properties director
*28:51.100- 28:57.540* :  from English Heritage Kate just tell us first of all how important the stones are. Stonehenge was
*28:57.920- 29:04.260* :  you know started to be built some 5,000 years ago and the people who built it built it intentionally
*29:04.260- 29:09.920* :  to align with the sun on the longest day of the year so the sun actually rises past the heel
*29:09.920- 29:16.360* :  stone and shines directly into the centre of the monument so we know the change of the seasons
*29:16.540- 29:20.680* :  and the movements of the sun were really important to theolithic people and so it's fantastic
*29:20.680- 29:26.500* :  that today we're seeing thousands of years later people reconnecting with Stonehenge and
*29:26.500- 29:32.980* :  gathering to celebrate the very same moment. There's a special day today because only twice a year
*29:33.420- 29:37.700* :  people can actually get close to the stones. Usually our visitors come and they enjoy the stones
*29:37.700- 29:42.440* :  from a distance whereas today we ask people to respect the stones but they are allowed to get
*29:42.440- 29:47.820* :  up close and to really kind of feel their energy and you know enjoy that moment when our sun rises
*29:47.820- 29:53.520* :  and they're right in the centre. It must be absolutely perfect whether for this it's not guaranteed
*29:53.520- 29:58.340* :  even in the middle of summer in the UK matters you know but you couldn't have had a better start.
*29:59.000- 30:04.060* :  Skies were clear there was a lovely mist in the valley the colleague dragons breath as well that
*30:04.060- 30:09.000* :  dissipated and now the sun's up it really is starting to warm up quite nicely and after what has
*30:09.000- 30:13.600* :  been a miserable start to the summer here in the UK a bit of sunshine a bit of warmth is that
*30:13.600- 30:19.300* :  certainly welcome. The idea of it feeling magical to be there just describe that to me because this
*30:19.300- 30:25.920* :  is clearly what draws people to come from far and wide to spend the night in the open air to mark
*30:25.920- 30:30.960* :  this occasion. What is the kind of magical sense that it has? I think part of it is it's a shared
*30:30.960- 30:36.480* :  experience with my driver get up early a lot I've seen many many a sunrise but it was just
*30:36.480- 30:42.720* :  been next to such a historic monument such a stone edge in amongst everybody else seeing that
*30:42.720- 30:50.000* :  moment in time altogether. Matt Taylor at Stonehenge and by the way you can watch the sunrise at Stonehenge
