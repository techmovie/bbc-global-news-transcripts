*01:20.760- 01:24.260* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.420- 01:32.140* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 13th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:32.720- 01:37.920* :  G7 leaders are in Italy for a summit at which they're likely to approve a plan to use frozen
*01:37.920- 01:43.420* :  Russian assets to fund the defence of Ukraine. The use top court is ordered hungry to pay a
*01:43.420- 01:48.600* :  fine of more than $200 million for failing to comply with the block's migration policy.
*01:51.220- 01:57.160* :  Also in this podcast, 1,000 days since the Taliban banned Afghan girls from attending high school,
*01:57.160- 02:03.220* :  the UN says that systematic exclusion is harming their mental health. A BBC Arabic investigation
*02:03.220- 02:08.380* :  has found that the warring parties in Sudan are using weapons provided by Iran and the United
*02:08.380- 02:14.760* :  Arab Emirates despite a UN arms embargo. And in the United States, a restaurant turns away
*02:14.760- 02:19.760* :  adult diners if they're not old enough. It's just something for the older people to come to
*02:20.040- 02:24.220* :  and I have to worry about so many young folks that bring some of that drama.
*02:26.720- 02:33.100* :  Under sunny skies in Bari, the Italian Prime Minister Georgi Amaloni fresh from her recent European
*02:33.100- 02:39.600* :  election success has been welcoming world leaders to a G7 summit. Migration is one of Italy's
*02:39.600- 02:44.760* :  biggest concerns, particularly with thousands of people every year trying to get across the Mediterranean
*02:44.760- 02:50.640* :  from Africa to Europe. Miss Maloni is asking other nations to contribute financially to what's
*02:50.640- 02:56.480* :  known as the Mate plan, which gives African countries grants and loans to develop their economies
*02:56.480- 02:58.260* :  and green energy projects.
*03:03.100- 03:09.240* :  Convey is a G7 that, under the Italian presidency, wants to strengthen its dialogue with the
*03:09.240- 03:14.840* :  nations of the global south. We've done this because this land is historically a bridge between
*03:14.840- 03:20.620* :  west and east. We'll hear more on the topic of migration shortly, but also high on the G7
*03:20.620- 03:26.560* :  agenda will be providing more help for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Western leaders are looking
*03:26.560- 03:31.800* :  to raise $50 billion to help Kiev defend itself against Moscow's full-scale invasion.
*03:31.800- 03:37.340* :  With President Biden facing a tough election against Donald Trump and other leaders politically
*03:37.340- 03:43.020* :  beleaguered at home, there's pressure to deliver military aid to Ukraine while they still can.
*03:43.020- 03:48.540* :  Ahead of the summit, the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he was hopeful the proposals
*03:48.540- 03:54.140* :  would be approved. I expect that today and tomorrow we will agree the plan for NATO security
*03:54.140- 04:00.600* :  assistance and training for Ukraine, but of course it remains work to do on the financial pledge.
*04:01.020- 04:06.740* :  My proposal is that we should agree a long-term financial pledge with a baseline of 40
*04:06.740- 04:12.920* :  billion per year. That is new fresh money every year delivered to Ukraine because they need that
*04:12.920- 04:19.000* :  to be sure that they have the resources to repel the Russian aggression against their country.
*04:19.380- 04:25.060* :  I asked our correspondent Mark Lohan, who's at the summit in Bari, more about the aid package for
*04:25.060- 04:30.160* :  Ukraine. I think it is the most likely deliverable, if you like, from this G7 summit.
*04:30.280- 04:36.820* :  There have been various plans. One idea was actually to freeze and seize, indeed, Russia's assets
*04:36.820- 04:41.620* :  in the West that are thought to be about $300 billion and liquidate them and use that for
*04:42.060- 04:47.040* :  money for Ukraine. That was supported by the U.S. and yet opposed by other parties including
*04:47.040- 04:50.780* :  Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, who thought that it would set a
*04:50.780- 04:55.400* :  dangerous precedent in the international financial system and potentially violate international law.
*04:55.780- 05:03.700* :  Then this new idea came out to take the interest on those Russian assets and front-load them,
*05:03.700- 05:09.080* :  so basically give from several years ahead interest, which they think would amount to about $50
*05:09.080- 05:15.920* :  billion in order to give to Ukraine. The loan would be given against the assets used as collateral,
*05:15.920- 05:20.620* :  basically. It would obviously be important for Ukraine at the moment, which is facing a renewed
*05:20.620- 05:27.100* :  Russian advance in some parts in the East. It is running dangerously short of money and weapons,
*05:27.100- 05:32.500* :  and so it needs everything that it can get. That will be a very strong sign of support from the G7,
*05:32.500- 05:38.340* :  as well, a pledge of another $300 to $120 million that, really soon act, the British Prime
*05:38.340- 05:42.360* :  Minister was likely to make to his Ukrainian counterpart, who will be a guest at the summit,
*05:42.800- 05:48.320* :  and Joe Biden will be signing a treaty with President Zelensky, promising long-term security
*05:48.320- 05:52.420* :  support for the country, even if he has booted out of the White House in November.
*05:52.680- 05:58.640* :  The summit being hosted by Georgie Maloney, who is basking in the glory of the recent European
*05:58.640- 06:05.040* :  election results. Yeah, and she's really arguably the strongest leader going into this summit.
*06:05.040- 06:09.260* :  I mean, leading a country that is notoriously politically volatile, it's known almost 70
*06:09.260- 06:14.360* :  governments since the Second World War, and yet she was the only Western European leader strengthened
*06:14.360- 06:19.200* :  by these European Union elections last weekend. Emmanuel Macron France has been
*06:19.200- 06:25.800* :  flawed by the far-right success there. Olaf Schultz delivered his party's worst ever European
*06:25.800- 06:30.340* :  Union election results, being in the third place by the far-right AFD. Rishi Sunak of the UK
*06:30.340- 06:35.080* :  is languishing in the opinion polls. Joe Biden could be booted out of the White House by Donald
*06:35.080- 06:38.520* :  Trump in November, and here you have Georgie Maloney, who says, you know, we are the strongest
*06:38.520- 06:43.580* :  government in the G7 now, and you know, we are a pillar of stability when our neighbours are losing
*06:43.640- 06:48.580* :  their footing. And Mark, there are some other important matters on the agenda. There are climate
*06:48.580- 06:55.060* :  and a push for countries to move faster in their transition to renewable energy. Italy and Germany
*06:55.060- 07:00.100* :  have been more reluctant to move further away from gas. There'll be a push for maybe a new treaty
*07:00.100- 07:04.720* :  on global plastics pollution. There will be a session dedicated to artificial intelligence,
*07:04.720- 07:09.580* :  which will be attended by none other than Pope Francis, who has called for more global regulation
*07:09.680- 07:14.920* :  of AI, and there'll be a discussion on Africa as well, with Italy placing energy and infrastructure
*07:15.700- 07:20.600* :  projects in Africa at the heart of its agenda and its presidency of the G7, hoping that more
*07:20.600- 07:25.200* :  investment in Africa will encourage young Africans to stay on the continent, rather than my great
*07:25.200- 07:32.300* :  often illegally to Europe. Mark Lohan. The UN Refugee Agency says the number of people forced to
*07:32.300- 07:37.440* :  leave their homes because of violence or persecution has risen for the 12th consecutive year
*07:37.440- 07:43.600* :  to 120 million. The agency's head, Filippo Grande, warned that world leaders were failing to tackle
*07:43.600- 07:50.440* :  the root causes of displacement. Here's image in folks. New conflicts breaking out, old ones continuing
*07:50.440- 07:57.420* :  and millions fleeing the violence. In Sudan alone, nine million people have been driven from their
*07:57.420- 08:04.920* :  homes in little more than a year. Syria, a conflict many have forgotten, remains the world's largest
*08:04.920- 08:13.440* :  displacement crisis with 13.8 million people unable to go home. The UN Refugee Agency condemned
*08:13.440- 08:20.180* :  the warring parties, saying blatant violations of international law were driving displacement
*08:20.220- 08:27.600* :  and misery. Image in folks. As we heard, Sudan in particular is a concern. Nine million people have
*08:27.600- 08:32.360* :  been forced to flee from their homes during the 14 month conflict that has devastated it.
*08:32.360- 08:37.800* :  Now, a BBC Arabic investigation has found evidence that despite a UN arms embargo,
*08:37.800- 08:45.480* :  the warring parties in Sudan are using weapons provided by Iran and the UAE, Abdul Rahman Abu Talab reports.
*08:48.500- 08:53.940* :  What you can hear is, there are bits of board forces celebrating, after downing a drone used
*08:53.940- 09:00.080* :  by the rivals, the Sudanese armed forces. Analysis of video footage by the peace organization
*09:00.080- 09:06.960* :  backs shows it to be Iranian-made. Wemz-Wenemberg humanitarian disarmament project leader for backs.
*09:07.480- 09:14.860* :  We see that the SAF have provided more drones in the conflict because they're getting support
*09:14.860- 09:18.900* :  from Iran. They're in a better position at the moment, so we already see that's having an impact.
*09:19.500- 09:25.800* :  Flight tracking and images show several Iranian planes landed in Port Sudan at the time these drones
*09:25.800- 09:43.940* :  started to appear, Wemz-Wenemberg one more time. The BBC has found evidence to support the UN's
*09:43.940- 09:51.320* :  accusation that the UAE has been supplying the RSF with arms. The UAE and Sudan's sovereignty
*09:51.320- 09:58.240* :  council have denied the allegations, the Sudanese army, the RSF, and the Iranian foreign ministry declined
*09:58.240- 10:05.300* :  to comment. Providing external weapons support would be a violation of the 2005 UN Security Council
*10:05.300- 10:11.120* :  resolution banning the supply of weapons to Sudan's therefore region. Brian Kastner,
*10:11.120- 10:17.820* :  Senior Crisis Advisor at Amnesty International. The parties to the conflict in Sudan have really
*10:17.820- 10:26.300* :  made a mockery of the embargo. UN Security Council needs to fulfill its responsibility, see the
*10:26.300- 10:31.940* :  massive internal displacement, see the number of civilians killed, and implement a comprehensive
*10:31.940- 10:40.560* :  arms embargo across the entire country immediately. Abdulrahman Abu Talib. A fine of $200 million
*10:40.560- 10:45.720* :  has been imposed on Hungary by the European Court of Justice for failing to comply with the
*10:45.720- 10:51.160* :  European Union's migration policy, and on top of that, there's a penalty of around a million
*10:51.160- 10:56.960* :  dollars a day until the Hungarian government makes the required policy changes. In 2020, the
*10:56.960- 11:02.380* :  anti-immigrant government of Viktor Orban pushed through a law forcing asylum seekers to apply
*11:02.380- 11:08.120* :  for travel permits at its embassies in Belgrade or Kiev. At the time, the European Court of Justice
*11:08.120- 11:14.220* :  ruled such practice to be in violation of EU laws. For more on this, I spoke to our correspondent
*11:14.220- 11:20.840* :  in Budapest, Nick Thorpe. This is a long story. The Hungarian government has been opposing migration
*11:21.060- 11:27.840* :  really since the big wave of migration in 2015. It established transit zones, and this is what
*11:27.840- 11:33.680* :  specifically this judgment refers to. Transit zones effectively are fenced areas built into its
*11:33.680- 11:41.260* :  border fence with Serbia. It did not, according to the Court, give asylum seekers an opportunity,
*11:41.260- 11:46.480* :  a proper opportunity to apply for asylum in Hungary, and then it pushed them back through the fence.
*11:46.500- 11:50.560* :  So it was found guilty, both of not giving the opportunity to apply for asylum,
*11:50.560- 11:56.020* :  then of pushing them back, and then since then of not implementing the court's order, a previous
*11:56.020- 12:02.040* :  court order from December 2020 on this. And this is probably an absolute outrage from the Hungarian
*12:02.040- 12:08.180* :  Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. Mr Orban, indeed, has said that this is outrageous and unacceptable,
*12:08.180- 12:14.720* :  and he's certainly given the impression that Hungary doesn't have to or doesn't intend to
*12:14.720- 12:21.700* :  implement it. On the other hand, it's hard to see what it can do now in this situation. It's certainly
*12:21.700- 12:27.520* :  the most serious of a series of court judges which have gone against the Hungarian government on
*12:27.520- 12:32.380* :  this issue. Yeah, what if Hungary refuses to pay? I think that is the position of the Hungarian
*12:32.380- 12:38.060* :  government at the moment, which will also argue that the EU migration rules are being overhauled,
*12:38.280- 12:44.620* :  often influenced by Hungary's position. As other countries come round to the need to, as they see,
*12:44.620- 12:51.000* :  to follow Mr Orban's logic of keeping people who try to cross into Europe illegally out.
*12:51.440- 12:58.460* :  But of course, the European Union can cut the money from other funds that the EU was intending
*12:58.460- 13:03.520* :  to give to Hungary. Of course, even those are held up at the moment because of rule of law
*13:03.520- 13:08.180* :  issues. So in a way, there's a sort of log jam of cases against Hungary at the moment in this
*13:08.180- 13:16.180* :  most serious one now on migration. Nick Thorpin Budapest. More than 300 years ago in 1714,
*13:16.180- 13:22.520* :  Britain established a prize worth 20,000 pounds for anyone who could find a way of pinpointing
*13:22.540- 13:29.560* :  a ship's longitude. Three centuries on, a new longitude prize was announced, now worth $10 million,
*13:30.460- 13:35.700* :  with a focus on tackling the modern problem of superbugs. That competition has run for a decade
*13:35.700- 13:41.960* :  with more than 250 entries. And on Wednesday night, the winner was announced at the Science Museum
*13:41.960- 13:47.880* :  here in London. The original work on the test was done by Swedish researchers and it is now being
*13:47.880- 13:54.540* :  sold by the company Sismex Astrayo. Our science correspondent, James Gallagher, was at the Science
*13:54.540- 14:01.000* :  Museum. This is a device that instead of it taking up to three days to confirm whether infection
*14:01.000- 14:05.580* :  is caused by bacteria and what drugs might work against it, this is something that does it
*14:05.760- 14:09.860* :  incredibly rapidly. So it only works in your own retract infections at the moment. But there's
*14:09.860- 14:13.800* :  little cartridge and you put a little bit of urine inside it and then that goes into the machine
*14:13.800- 14:19.180* :  and it monitors how those bacteria in there like grow under the presence of different antibiotics.
*14:19.800- 14:24.660* :  And so within 15 minutes it confirms whether or not you're actually dealing with a bacterial
*14:25.240- 14:30.380* :  infection and within 45 minutes a little display lights up on the top of the device and it tells you
*14:30.980- 14:36.660* :  which is the best drug to use to treat that infection. So you're taking a process that takes three
*14:36.660- 14:40.800* :  days down to less than an hour. In terms of how much it's going to be used for patients,
*14:41.260- 14:44.760* :  comes down to what it always comes down to we've chat about these things, money and how affordable
*14:44.760- 14:49.820* :  it is. So I can very easily see a world and not too distant future where in rich countries this
*14:49.820- 14:54.280* :  becomes part of the routine process where you have a patient that comes in, you don't know what's
*14:54.280- 14:58.800* :  causing their infection, you do a test like this, it confirms the infection rapidly and that patient
*14:58.800- 15:04.180* :  leaves that doctor's surgery with the right treatment at the right time. But there will be many many
*15:04.180- 15:10.120* :  countries where antimicrobial resistance is a huge problem where devices like this are still going
*15:10.120- 15:14.740* :  to be too expensive for many years to come. One of the things that's on the horizon is could you
*15:14.740- 15:19.240* :  look at bloodstream infections as well? Could you take a sample of blood and basically perform a
*15:19.240- 15:24.060* :  very similar analysis to work out what was going on there? But yeah absolutely the dream is to go
*15:24.060- 15:28.980* :  from what at the moment is sometimes guessing what the right treatment is and if that doesn't work
*15:28.980- 15:34.000* :  just moving on to the next room to actually having the knowledge to be able to prescribe drugs in a
*15:34.000- 15:39.620* :  much more informed way which has two benefits. It stops the overuse of antibiotics when we don't
*15:39.620- 15:45.900* :  need them but at the same time gets better treatment for patients. Our Health and Science Correspondent
*15:45.900- 15:52.740* :  James Gallagher. In the United States it's not strange to see venues impose strict age restrictions
*15:52.740- 15:59.380* :  on children and young adults under the legal drinking age of 21. However a restaurant in Missouri
*15:59.380- 16:06.180* :  has gone one step further turning people away as old as 34. Elebicinal reports.
*16:11.820- 16:17.100* :  Marvin and his wife Tina set up bliss restaurant in the southern St. Louis suburbs to bring the
*16:17.100- 16:22.680* :  joy of their Caribbean resort holidays to their local community as a fraction of the cost.
*16:22.680- 16:28.060* :  For their maintaining that sophisticated environment meant a straight age limit for patrons.
*16:28.060- 16:35.080* :  Driver licenses checked at the door or women under the age of 30 and all men under 35 will be
*16:35.080- 16:40.780* :  denied entry. Tina says they wanted it to have the right ambience. It's just something for the
*16:40.780- 16:45.660* :  older people to come to and have a happy hour come get some good food and I have to worry about
*16:45.660- 16:51.680* :  some of the young folks that bring some of that drama. However Marvin says not everyone has
*16:51.680- 16:56.960* :  reacted well to the policy. Of course we have been getting a little backlash but that's okay
*16:56.960- 17:03.400* :  because we're sticking to our code. Some online commentators have accused the restaurant of age
*17:03.400- 17:09.500* :  discrimination bombarding their site with one star reviews but others have taken to social media
*17:09.500- 17:15.440* :  to support the move. One user said it created a very pleasant dining experience and they'd even
*17:15.440- 17:21.420* :  support an age limit to 40 and over. Others said the ban was an understandable response to say
*17:21.420- 17:27.600* :  Louis's historically high rates of anti social behaviour. Legal concerns have been raised.
*17:27.600- 17:33.200* :  However in Missouri the state's human rights act bums discrimination only on the grounds of
*17:33.200- 17:39.180* :  sex, race, religion and disability. Eating establishments cannot impose age limits on staff
*17:39.180- 17:44.680* :  but those protections don't apply to its customers and no doubt other restaurants will be watching
*17:44.680- 17:51.240* :  closely to see if the age limit restrictions on patrons imposed by bliss turn out to be a success.
*17:51.980- 17:59.980* :  Elebignol. Still to come, how a caretaker in Kenya got more than he bargained for.
*18:02.300- 18:08.600* :  As I was returning the dogs were backing very loudly. To my surprise I saw a lioness running
*18:08.600- 18:11.280* :  after one of the dogs towards one corner of the compound.
*18:20.720- 18:25.380* :  How would you like to look five years younger? In a clinical study, people that had volume
*18:25.380- 18:31.060* :  added with Juvederm Voluma XC in the cheeks perceived themselves as looking five years younger
*18:31.060- 18:37.360* :  at six months after treatment. Look younger, feel like you. Add volume for lift and contour in
*18:37.360- 18:42.800* :  the cheeks with Juvederm Voluma XC. Reverse signs of aging by adding volume to smooth

*19:58.140- 20:04.160* :  The United Nations Children's Agency says 1,000 days of past since the Taliban banned girls
*20:04.160- 20:09.860* :  in Afghanistan from attending secondary schools. UNICEF said the systematic exclusion of the
*20:09.860- 20:15.120* :  youngsters was not only a blatant violation of their right to education, but it also resulted
*20:15.120- 20:20.240* :  in their deteriorating mental health. I asked our South Asia regional editor and
*20:20.240- 20:26.440* :  Barassan Etirajan how many girls were affected. This is the third academic year for the Afghan
*20:26.440- 20:34.080* :  girls, those who want to go to secondary schools. And we are talking about nearly 1.5 million
*20:34.080- 20:40.680* :  Afghan girls who are unable to go to their normal schools since the Taliban seized power in August
*20:40.680- 20:48.220* :  2021. On average, about 350,000 girls they graduate from class five going into the secondary schools.
*20:48.940- 20:54.360* :  But now the issue is, more and more girls are staying at home. Even though they have the opportunity
*20:54.360- 20:59.660* :  to go to Islamic religious schools, many parents, they don't want to send them there because
*20:59.660- 21:05.540* :  they only teach religious subjects. And this is what UNICEF is saying. It is not simply about
*21:05.540- 21:11.640* :  denying them opportunities. It is also having a huge impact on their mental health. Imagine
*21:11.640- 21:16.340* :  if you're sitting at home wanting to study, wanting to go to school, but then the rules
*21:16.340- 21:21.520* :  doesn't allow you. You will be punished if you try to learn something. And that is why the UN
*21:21.520- 21:28.140* :  says that every additional day, more dreams die. And the effect on girls and young women is
*21:28.140- 21:32.300* :  life changing in the most awful way, isn't it? You know, many young women from Afghanistan,
*21:32.300- 21:37.620* :  they want to become artists, doctors, poets and engineers. And what are the opportunities?
*21:37.620- 21:43.240* :  Education is not simply about career for Afghans. And what the UN and other agencies say,
*21:43.240- 21:49.440* :  it will teach them life-saving skills. And in a society like in South Asia, where if a young girl
*21:49.440- 21:55.440* :  16, 17 at home, the priority for the parents would be to get them married. So at least if they go
*21:55.440- 22:00.940* :  to school, they can think about university. As you know, Taliban also banned women from starting
*22:00.940- 22:07.880* :  universities, going to universities in December 2022. And also malnutrition. Also how to prevent
*22:07.880- 22:13.540* :  them from any big disasters. How to advise their village community people. So these were the
*22:13.540- 22:19.800* :  opportunities the girls can have that has been denied. And now the Taliban rulers, they keep on
*22:19.800- 22:25.920* :  saying that a suitable environment has to be created to open these schools. But then three
*22:25.920- 22:32.220* :  academic years have passed. People are waiting for them to take a decision on that. And in the meanwhile,
*22:32.220- 22:37.780* :  when there are so many sanctions against Taliban restrictions, four of the leaders, they were allowed
*22:37.780- 22:44.880* :  to go to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj to Mecca. And what the analysts and the civil society
*22:44.880- 22:50.300* :  activists have been saying, unless you put pressure on Taliban, they are not going to change their
*22:50.300- 22:57.900* :  policies towards women. And Barassan et Arahjan. It's three weeks until the British general election.
*22:57.900- 23:04.320* :  And today, the main opposition party, Labour, has presented its manifesto. It's plans if elected
*23:04.320- 23:09.600* :  as the next government. The economy is a central objective and Labour's leader, Sir Kier Starmer,
*23:09.960- 23:16.140* :  has told voters they have the chance to turn the page on 14 years of what he called conservative
*23:16.140- 23:22.100* :  chaos. The Labour leader said he was seeking a mandate for economic growth with wealth creation
*23:22.100- 23:27.480* :  his number one priority. Since the last general election, one by the conservative party five years ago,
*23:28.120- 23:34.000* :  the economy has barely grown. So how are voters and businesses feeling and can anything be done?
*23:34.000- 23:40.100* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson reports. Since the last general election in 2019,
*23:40.100- 23:46.460* :  there's been a fall or stagnation of real incomes on a scale unprecedented in the last 60 years.
*23:47.000- 23:52.620* :  One visible sign of that, food banks, even here in prosperous Epson, just south of London.
*23:53.620- 23:58.520* :  Hi, I'm Bex. I'm the Panty Manager here for Good Come with me. We have lots of fresh fruit
*23:58.520- 24:05.160* :  and veg, dairy products, meat and so on. People's income is just not matching,
*24:05.260- 24:08.780* :  they're outgones at the minute and people aren't able to make ends meet.
*24:09.340- 24:14.900* :  When the Conservatives first came to power in 2010, just over 60,000 people used food banks.
*24:15.360- 24:19.420* :  Now it's nearly 3 million. I'm going to have a quick word with one of the clients here,
*24:19.420- 24:23.060* :  a woman who I understand works for Britain's National Health Service.
*24:23.500- 24:28.260* :  I own a good salary, so this is my partner, but you know, you're not benefiting really from it.
*24:28.800- 24:32.080* :  People would be amazed when they're sort of listening around the world. You have a good salary,
*24:32.120- 24:36.260* :  you're a partner, you work in the health system, but still it's hard to make ends meet.
*24:36.920- 24:42.980* :  We rent and we're a family of five and we have had to move into basically a two bedroom,
*24:42.980- 24:47.060* :  but one of them's a box room, so we then have to sleep on sofa,
*24:48.060- 24:52.300* :  because we cannot afford a free bed in this area. It's too expensive.
*24:55.640- 25:00.040* :  But it's not just individuals and families feeling the squeeze, business does too.
*25:00.900- 25:06.320* :  Mark, really, I'm prepared to have came at and we're in our factory making tea trays and
*25:06.320- 25:10.700* :  trullies that we sell around the world. Businesses here in Britain and around the world
*25:10.700- 25:15.140* :  are been affected by the war in Ukraine, by COVID. Businesses and Britain like yours
*25:15.140- 25:20.900* :  have been affected by Brexit as well. Well, yeah, it's really frustrating. It's a big wound to
*25:20.900- 25:26.400* :  businesses like ours. It's a wound that keeps on bleeding. It's just got a lot more difficult
*25:26.400- 25:32.560* :  to get our stuff over to Europe. It's slower, it's more expensive, it's a giant pain in the neck.
*25:33.220- 25:38.140* :  Businesses and individuals alike are all agreed what Britain really needs is stronger economic
*25:38.140- 25:43.860* :  growth. So I'm now leaving the came at factory here in South London to see leading economist Paul
*25:43.860- 25:48.920* :  Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, to find out whether either of the main
*25:48.920- 25:55.700* :  parties has a credible plan for getting Britain growing again. Not obviously, no. It's worth
*25:55.700- 26:00.040* :  saying that the UK is by no means the only country whose growth has slowed a lot since the
*26:00.040- 26:06.200* :  financial crisis, ours has slowed more than many others. Well, we have had some ideas from
*26:06.200- 26:12.440* :  Labour. They want to liberalise our appallingly sclerotic and expensive planning system.
*26:12.920- 26:19.300* :  The Conservatives are more focused on trying to find space for some more tax cuts over the coming
*26:19.300- 26:24.500* :  period. We're not getting a deep discussion of any of those. And I'm calling you and actually
*26:24.500- 26:29.540* :  pretty much every economist in this country has said that during the general election campaign,
*26:29.540- 26:35.580* :  the politicians aren't being honest with the voters. What do you mean by that? What I mean is that
*26:35.580- 26:41.500* :  we're not being told what's actually likely to happen in terms of tax and spending over the next
*26:41.500- 26:47.520* :  few years to get debt falling by the end of the parliament. We are going to have to either increase
*26:47.520- 26:52.580* :  taxes beyond where they are at the moment and they're ready at historic high in UK standards
*26:52.960- 26:58.920* :  or cut spending across a range of public services. But neither party is seriously addressing
*26:58.920- 27:05.320* :  those choices. So whoever wins the election will inherit a challenge. Britain's national
*27:05.320- 27:10.880* :  debt is high, growth forecast to low, its public service is under pressure from an aging and
*27:10.880- 27:18.240* :  healing population. Perhaps whoever wins can draw some comfort from polling, which suggests voters'
*27:18.240- 27:27.880* :  expectations are low. Rob Watson. Now to Kenya where residents in a suburb of the capital
*27:27.880- 27:32.660* :  in Nairobi are on high alert following a series of sightings of lions in their neighborhood.
*27:32.700- 27:38.340* :  The homeless border, the Nairobi National Park and officials say one reason for the increase
*27:38.340- 27:43.900* :  in sightings is due to recent torrential floods which killed hundreds of people and forced the
*27:43.900- 27:50.720* :  animals to move from their usual grazing areas. Here is caretaker Joshua A. Sige describing an
*27:50.720- 27:58.820* :  incident of a family compound that he was taking care of last month. I had just stepped out of the
*27:58.820- 28:04.920* :  house walking towards the toilet. As I was returning the dogs were backing very loudly. I turned to see
*28:04.920- 28:10.420* :  what was happening. To my surprise I saw a lioness running after one of the dogs towards one
*28:10.420- 28:15.180* :  corner of the compound. It got hold of the dog, pressing it down. I hit her and she's hopping
*28:15.180- 28:21.340* :  the noise will scare the lioness so that it can let go of the dog. But unfortunately it already had
*28:21.340- 28:27.240* :  the poor pet family in its jaws. Then it ran towards the gate, jumped over and wanked away.
*28:28.800- 28:35.120* :  The BBC's Peter Musenby caught up with Sylvia Quera, the college student whose family dog was
*28:35.120- 28:42.760* :  taken and eaten by the lioness three weeks ago. We are constantly in fear because we don't know if
*28:42.760- 28:47.740* :  it will come again and we just don't want to experience another loss. We even have a
*28:47.740- 28:53.940* :  trap. They set it up for the lioness in case it comes back. It looks like a cage but it has two
*28:54.020- 29:00.000* :  sides. There's the bait side and then there's the trap side. Both sides are separated with a
*29:00.240- 29:06.320* :  decastil mesh so that when the lion enters it cannot eat the bait. They put a dog, a stray dog.
*29:06.720- 29:13.780* :  Take me back to that night when this lioness jumped over the gate into your compound.
*29:14.000- 29:20.720* :  It was around 10 pm. We just had a cry sound of a dog but we assumed that it was just
*29:20.720- 29:26.600* :  something else. But when the catick came in to tell us that he's seen a lioness in our compound
*29:26.600- 29:32.200* :  that's when we went out to look. Then we were looking for our dog, JC. We couldn't find it.
*29:32.320- 29:37.720* :  That's when we called my mother for how to check the CCTV camera. Then she told us that there
*29:37.720- 29:43.060* :  was a lioness and it helped take in our dog. It could have been more fatal because the catick
*29:43.060- 29:47.840* :  is the one who saw it. He was lucky because it could have been him. It could have been
*29:47.840- 29:54.520* :  anyone even a child. So the Acora is speaking to Peter Macembi and to hear a longer version of
*29:54.520- 30:00.880* :  that episode just search for BBC Africa Daily wherever you get your podcasts. The ancient Maya
*30:00.880- 30:07.160* :  city of Chichen it's in Mexico has long been associated with human sacrifice with hundreds of
*30:07.160- 30:13.180* :  bones unearthed from temples a sacred sinkhole and other underground caverns. It has long been
*30:13.180- 30:18.680* :  thought that the victims were often young and female but analysis of DNA of human remains
*30:19.400- 30:24.140* :  has revealed something different as James Reed reports. The children were thrown into an
*30:24.140- 30:29.540* :  underground water system in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula as an offering to the gods more than a thousand
*30:29.540- 30:37.020* :  years ago. Part of a well documented Maya practice of human sacrifice. Now DNA extracted from
*30:37.020- 30:43.080* :  64 of them has shown that they were all boys. Some were brothers and there were two sets of
*30:43.080- 30:50.120* :  identical twins. Previous research and Spanish colonial accounts suggested the Maya favorite
*30:50.120- 30:55.760* :  girls as sacrificial victims. The researchers think the boys may have been specifically selected
*30:55.760- 31:01.520* :  as sibling pairs for sacrifice. Twins were regarded as all spacious in Maya cosmology
*31:02.180- 31:08.680* :  and subterranean waterways were seen as gateways to the land of the dead. Chichen Itza with its
*31:08.680- 31:13.960* :  mighty pyramids was one of many great cities that rose and fell in the centuries before the
*31:13.960- 31:20.580* :  Spanish conquest brought Maya civilization crashing down. But the study also found strong genetic
*31:20.580- 31:26.700* :  continuity with the indigenous Maya who live in the area today and their language and culture
*31:26.700- 31:33.420* :  remain rooted in the traditions of their ancestors. James Reed. The Canadian singer
*31:33.420- 31:38.840* :  Celine Dion was forced to cancel her last tour due to an autoimmune disorder called
*31:38.840- 31:45.700* :  stiff person syndrome which causes painful spasms. Now she's made a documentary about her diagnosis
*31:45.700- 31:51.320* :  and how she struggled to perform when she didn't know what was wrong. The BBC's Emma Vardy traveled
*31:51.320- 32:00.780* :  to Las Vegas to meet her. Celine Dion's voice is her instrument and vocal exercises are vital.
*32:01.500- 32:04.540* :  To audiences she's one of the world's most powerful singers.
*32:16.380- 32:21.780* :  She revealed that for years behind the scenes she was experiencing symptoms that went unrecognized
*32:21.780- 32:27.800* :  and was struggling to keep up with her demanding performances. A diagnosis finally brought answers
*32:27.800- 32:33.480* :  when she was told she was suffering from a condition that causes muscles to spasm known as
*32:33.480- 32:38.920* :  stiff person syndrome. She's only been seen rarely since announcing she'd be stepping back from
*32:38.920- 32:45.400* :  performing. Now in a new documentary she explains how she's being rehabilitated and is now planning
*32:54.500- 32:58.100* :  a new show in Las Vegas. Celine Dion is working with doctors to help learn more about her condition
*32:58.100- 33:04.000* :  which can be managed with medication and physical therapy. It's only found in around one in a
*33:04.000- 33:10.220* :  million people and Celine says she hopes to be part of finding a cure. Her previous residences in
*33:10.220- 33:16.120* :  Las Vegas across 16 years have been the best selling of all time and she says she's determined
*33:16.120- 33:18.020* :  to return to performing here again.
*33:34.940- 33:41.040* :  Emma Vardy with that report. To Australia now which has one of the highest rates of
*33:41.400- 33:47.820* :  pet ownership in the world, Australians are now spending more than 20 billion dollars a year on
*33:47.820- 33:53.240* :  their pets. It's a huge industry that's grown rapidly since the pandemic. In response, Virgin
*33:53.240- 33:59.600* :  Australia plans to allow dogs and cats to travel with their owners in aircraft cabins this year
*33:59.600- 34:03.800* :  after roading out the service in the US from Sydney Filmerser reports.
*34:07.040- 34:13.740* :  Many businesses know are trickled to about making money from dogs. From daycare to vets and grooming,
*34:14.760- 34:21.340* :  Australia's pet industry that grew rapidly during the COVID pandemic is worth billions of dollars.
*34:22.160- 34:28.720* :  Across Australia there are more pets than people. The bond Australians have with their pets is strong
*34:28.720- 34:35.720* :  despite economic uncertainty. But many animals are abandoned or taken to shelters.
*34:35.980- 34:42.540* :  The Gigi Rescue Cat Cafe in Sydney offers the unwanted a second chance.
*34:42.540- 34:48.740* :  I don't say that it is cheap and easy to have cats or dogs. First of all, it is 20 years commitment.
*34:48.740- 34:53.720* :  It's not just a birthday present. The cost of having pets is not cheap. If they got sick,
*34:53.720- 34:59.660* :  even just the easy consultation costs a lot. There are physical and psychological benefits
*34:59.660- 35:05.700* :  of having a furry friend. It's sociable and you get plenty of exercise. There is a significant
*35:05.700- 35:12.740* :  economic dividend. It's estimated that each year Australians spend about 22 billion dollars on
*35:12.740- 35:21.720* :  their pets that include fish, birds and snakes. But cost of living pressures have left their mark
*35:21.720- 35:29.740* :  and many pet owners are cutting back where they can. What I've noticed since the third or fourth
*35:29.800- 35:35.780* :  increase in interest rates, people are taking a lot longer to come to the grooming table.
*35:36.560- 35:40.260* :  So whereas before they might have come every six weeks, they're probably now coming every eight or
*35:40.260- 35:46.100* :  ten. There's definitely a bit of a pinch. Despite the challenges, however, working with dogs has its
*35:46.100- 35:56.360* :  rewards. You get to hang around with people like dogs like Bonnie, which is a great lifestyle.
*35:57.160- 36:03.780* :  And it's a lifestyle that one airline wants to get on board with. Virgin Australia has plans to
*36:03.780- 36:10.900* :  become the country's first airline to let small cats and dogs fly in the cabin on some domestic flights.
