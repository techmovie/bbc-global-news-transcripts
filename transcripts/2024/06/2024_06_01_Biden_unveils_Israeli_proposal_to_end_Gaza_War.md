*01:38.120- 01:43.000* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Saturday the 1st of June, these are our main stories.
*01:43.700- 01:48.880* :  President Biden has urged Hamas to accept a new peace deal he says Israel has put forward,
*01:48.880- 01:55.200* :  saying it's time for the war to end. Donald Trump has confirmed he'll appeal against his
*01:55.200- 02:01.800* :  historic criminal conviction in his latest tirade against his trial. Aid agencies have warned
*02:01.800- 02:07.660* :  that Sudan will face widespread famine unless they give an access to regions ravaged by the civil war.
*02:10.720- 02:15.700* :  Also in this podcast? This rare tropical plant is found only in new caledonia in the
*02:15.700- 02:20.500* :  Pacific Ocean and on a few neighbouring islands. It belongs to a group of little known
*02:20.500- 02:26.620* :  ferns that have been around since before the time of the dinosaurs. A tiny plant has entered
*02:26.620- 02:32.100* :  the record books for having the most DNA material of any living thing.
*02:36.460- 02:40.740* :  In his first major address, outlining how the war in Gaza might end,
*02:40.740- 02:47.220* :  President Biden has put forward what he says is a new Israeli proposal. The three-part plan
*02:47.220- 02:52.300* :  would begin with a six-week ceasefire in which the Israel Defence Forces, or IDF,
*02:52.600- 02:58.980* :  would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. There would also be a surge of humanitarian aid
*02:58.980- 03:05.300* :  as well as an exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The deal would eventually lead
*03:05.340- 03:10.920* :  to a permanent cessation of hostilities and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza.
*03:11.920- 03:17.200* :  Mr. Biden urged Hamas to accept the deal. This is truly a decisive moment.
*03:18.080- 03:24.420* :  Hamas says it wants a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.
*03:24.520- 03:30.880* :  For months, people all over the world have called for ceasefire. Now it's time to raise your voices
*03:31.420- 03:37.420* :  and demand that Hamas come to the table. Hamas has said it's ready to respond positively.
*03:37.420- 03:43.400* :  But even though Mr. Biden said this wasn't his daily plan, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*03:43.400- 03:49.620* :  has responded by insisting the war would only end once Hamas' military and governmental
*03:49.620- 03:56.140* :  capabilities had been destroyed. Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yuga Bashiga, assesses this latest
*03:56.140- 04:02.300* :  initiative. President Biden called it a comprehensive proposal that has been put forward by Israel
*04:02.300- 04:07.940* :  and that has been presented to Hamas. And some of the key points are familiar points because they
*04:07.940- 04:14.280* :  were included in earlier efforts to reach a deal in Gaza. This includes a first phase,
*04:14.380- 04:21.560* :  which would include a six-week temporary ceasefire in Gaza. You would see the release of some of
*04:21.560- 04:27.460* :  the hostages being held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians who were being held in Israeli jails.
*04:27.760- 04:32.360* :  Then this would pave the way for a second phase. And I think this is the key point here in
*04:32.360- 04:38.140* :  this proposal because President Biden talked about a permanent ceasefire. In other words,
*04:38.140- 04:45.660* :  the end of the war in Gaza and that the Americans would guarantee this permanent ceasefire.
*04:46.020- 04:52.560* :  Now, President Biden also said that Hamas has been degraded to an extent that it doesn't have
*04:52.560- 04:59.300* :  the ability to carry out another attack like October 7th. So obviously trying to address security
*04:59.300- 05:05.560* :  concerns from the Israeli authorities. Still, this plan is likely to face opposition from some
*05:05.560- 05:12.040* :  far-right supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who have rejected the idea of reaching
*05:12.040- 05:17.920* :  a deal with Hamas. They say that the war must continue and that military pressure is the only
*05:17.920- 05:24.380* :  way to guarantee the release of the hostages who are still in Gaza. And for Hamas, I think the
*05:24.380- 05:29.980* :  President is trying to frame this proposal as something that is impossible to be rejected.
*05:30.480- 05:36.700* :  Now, the President described this as a truly decisive moment and he said it is time for this
*05:36.700- 05:44.880* :  war to end and for the day after in Gaza to begin. U.S. election campaign has moved into
*05:44.880- 05:50.520* :  uncharted territory. On Friday, a day after Donald Trump's historic criminal conviction,
*05:50.520- 05:56.060* :  the former President gave a long and at times rambling speech at Trump Tower in New York,
*05:56.600- 06:01.920* :  angrily attacking his opponents, denouncing the trial and insisting he's innocent.
*06:02.560- 06:10.860* :  As far as the trial itself, it was very unfair. We weren't allowed to use our election expert.
*06:11.580- 06:18.280* :  It was a rigged trial. We wanted a venue change where we could have a fair trial. We didn't get it.
*06:18.480- 06:24.600* :  We wanted a judge. It wasn't conflicted and obviously he didn't do that. Nobody's ever seen
*06:24.600- 06:30.960* :  anything like it. Mr. Trump has confirmed that he will appeal. He was found guilty of falsifying
*06:30.960- 06:36.320* :  business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star. He will be sentenced in July
*06:36.320- 06:42.840* :  and could face jail, although experts believe a fine is more likely. With less than six months to go
*06:42.840- 06:48.820* :  into the U.S. presidential election, the Biden campaign said Mr. Trump was desperate and unhinged.
*06:49.220- 06:54.280* :  President Biden said the threat Mr. Trump posed to America's democracy had never been greater
*06:54.800- 07:01.120* :  and the ballot box was the only way to keep him out of the White House. It's reckless. It's dangerous.
*07:01.760- 07:07.480* :  It's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict.
*07:08.680- 07:13.560* :  Well, we got more from our correspondent, Nidda Tulfik, who was outside Trump Tower on a rather
*07:13.560- 07:21.400* :  noisy 5th avenue. Essentially what we have is the world's media protesters who support and do not
*07:21.400- 07:26.820* :  support Donald Trump have all basically migrated from Lower Manhattan and the courthouse to hear.
*07:27.360- 07:34.780* :  And so often we have loud trucks with big Trump flags and Trump music blasting. His supporters
*07:34.780- 07:41.120* :  passionately saying this is a witch hunt very much echoing his claims. But we also have protesters
*07:41.260- 07:49.620* :  shouting, lock him up, holding signs that say guilty, don the felon. So a quite an atmosphere outside
*07:49.620- 07:56.540* :  of Trump Tower as Americans absorb this historic moment. And the man himself repeating
*07:56.540- 08:02.880* :  many of his claims about how this trial was unfair, how it was rigged. And the Biden campaign
*08:02.880- 08:10.420* :  are calling him desperate and unhinged. It seems that the Biden campaign think that this
*08:10.420- 08:17.480* :  trial is to their benefit. Look, I mean Donald Trump many expected him to come out in this speech
*08:18.740- 08:26.840* :  with kind of fiery rhetoric, angry, defiance. And many noted that he maintained a demeanor that
*08:27.260- 08:35.300* :  looked very much like he did at the end of the trial, a bit worn out. He instead of launching
*08:35.300- 08:41.600* :  into that kind of campaign rhetoric that would normally fire up his base, he just briefly touched
*08:41.600- 08:48.140* :  on the economy, inflation, the border. But he focused instead on this stream of consciousness
*08:48.140- 08:56.200* :  venting about the judge, about the whole process, the whole trial, witnesses, saying and confirming
*08:56.200- 09:02.300* :  that he would be appealing his verdict. And through only applause he got in his speech was when
*09:02.300- 09:10.380* :  he mentions that he had raised nearly $35 million in small donations in the 12 hours since his
*09:10.380- 09:19.940* :  conviction in the Hush Money trial. So Democrats seized on that, calling him unhinged, saying that he
*09:19.940- 09:29.760* :  is defeated. I think we are going to definitely see Democrats using this verdict, the fact that he
*09:29.760- 09:36.160* :  is a convicted felon to their advantage. But we'll see in the kind of weeks and months ahead
*09:36.780- 09:41.100* :  how this impacts Trump politically, because nobody really knows at this point yet.
*09:42.420- 09:45.340* :  Nettaurvik will another one of our correspondents in the US,
*09:45.340- 09:51.180* :  Gary O'Donnelly, who considers how Trump's conviction and his aftermath might both affect
*09:51.180- 09:58.100* :  the presidential election and US society as a whole. A country which so often holds itself up as
*09:58.100- 10:03.780* :  an example to the rest of the world now finds itself in an exceptional place it would never have
*10:03.780- 10:09.840* :  chosen. But what hasn't changed is that Donald Trump remains the Republican's choice for president,
*10:09.900- 10:15.720* :  despite his conviction, and there's nothing to stop him continuing to run for the White House.
*10:16.540- 10:22.040* :  Indeed, among many of his voters, this will galvanize their support even more and have them
*10:22.040- 10:28.120* :  reaching deeper into their pockets. Given the timescale of any appeal, it's highly unlikely
*10:28.120- 10:32.960* :  he will be able to clear his name before Election Day, whatever the merits of his case.
*10:33.780- 10:38.960* :  Given this is a conviction brought in an individual state, he will not have the power to pardon
*10:38.960- 10:45.200* :  himself should he become president. The irony of this particular trial and verdict is that this
*10:45.200- 10:51.120* :  was considered to be the least of all his legal problems. But with three other criminal cases
*10:51.120- 10:57.740* :  mired in delays, two of them relating to election interference, this is the one that has altered the
*10:57.740- 11:05.640* :  landscape of US politics forever. Gary O'Donohue, 19 international humanitarian agencies have
*11:05.640- 11:10.280* :  warned that unless the warring sides in Sudan give them access to civilians caught up in the
*11:10.280- 11:15.460* :  fighting that has been raging for more than a year, then a famine will take hold in large parts
*11:15.460- 11:20.840* :  of the country. Around nine million people have been displaced since the Civil War erupted
*11:20.840- 11:27.120* :  last April. The agencies say aid workers trying to help them are being killed, injured and harassed.
*11:27.280- 11:32.640* :  Will Ross reports. So far the warring sides in Sudan have paid no attention to the calls for an
*11:32.640- 11:37.960* :  end to the fighting, which is causing so much suffering. 19 humanitarian agencies have made a new
*11:37.960- 11:43.100* :  appeal for civilians to be protected and for aid to be allowed in. The organizations that are being
*11:43.100- 11:47.660* :  blocked from delivering aid say there's a rapidly shrinking window to get seeds to farmers.
*11:47.660- 11:52.500* :  Because of the war, there's already widespread hunger in Sudan. Millions of children are
*11:52.500- 11:56.800* :  cutely malnourished and now a warning that famine is quickly closing in.
*11:57.940- 12:04.880* :  Will Ross. It was once one of China's largest companies, a sprawling property empire that epitomised
*12:04.880- 12:10.660* :  the Chinese housing boom. But in the past few years, Evergrande has seen its debts balloon to more
*12:10.660- 12:17.720* :  than $300 billion after the authorities introduced measures to curb the amount real estate developers
*12:17.720- 12:24.300* :  can borrow. In January, Hong Kong court ordered it to be liquidated and now it's been dealt
*12:24.300- 12:30.080* :  another blow with Chinese regulators finding it more than half a billion dollars for alleged
*12:30.080- 12:36.020* :  financial misconduct. Our Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Bristo, told me more about the massive fine.
*12:36.700- 12:43.040* :  $577 million dollars, the huge amount of money leaving aside the fact that
*12:43.040- 12:48.900* :  can this indebted company actually pay this fine. Essentially, fraudulent business practices
*12:49.680- 12:57.120* :  inflate in both its revenue and its profit. Absolutely inflated, it's revenue by about $80 billion.
*12:57.180- 13:02.320* :  How on earth it could have done that? I'm not quite sure. That's what it's been find for.
*13:02.720- 13:09.680* :  And that inflated revenue allowed it to issue bonds to raise even more money. So that's where the
*13:09.680- 13:16.380* :  fraudulent business practices come in. Also, the founder of the company Huayi Ka Yen has been
*13:16.380- 13:22.820* :  find himself and banned from trading securities for life. But he's got more serious problems
*13:22.820- 13:27.800* :  he faces at the moment because he's under investigation. And Evergrande now has a dubious honor of
*13:27.800- 13:34.820* :  being the world's most indebted developer with more than $300 billion US dollars worth of
*13:35.420- 13:41.500* :  total liabilities. How did it get into such a mess? Essentially what it did, its business model was
*13:41.500- 13:47.380* :  we take in money from people who want to buy a house before we've built the house. And then we
*13:47.380- 13:53.000* :  use that money to buy more land. Then we sell more properties, which is going to based on that
*13:53.060- 13:57.540* :  land. And we use the money we get from that to build the houses that the first people gave us
*13:57.540- 14:03.080* :  money for. So it's a bit like a Ponzi scheme. And it all came crashing down in 2020 when the
*14:03.080- 14:09.200* :  Chinese government said you can't hold that much debt and everything began to unwind from there.
*14:09.200- 14:14.940* :  And essentially now it's difficult to see what the company is. A Hong Kong court has said it
*14:14.940- 14:20.520* :  needs to wind up. It's difficult to see a lot of these properties which it's taken money for,
*14:20.560- 14:24.780* :  which haven't been built whether they're going to get built. I'm not quite sure what exists of
*14:24.780- 14:30.340* :  the company at the moment. It's kind of a someone described it as a controlled implosion.
*14:30.740- 14:36.000* :  And it's not just ever grand. Much of China's real estate market is in serious difficulties.
*14:36.600- 14:40.680* :  And this is all a big drag on an economy that's already struggling. Yeah, I mean the property
*14:40.680- 14:45.880* :  market in China was worth about a quarter of the economy. So it's a big drive of the economy.
*14:46.640- 14:51.860* :  If you imagine 30, 40 years ago, nobody had a house in China or nobody owned a house in China.
*14:52.560- 14:58.000* :  Then everybody started buying houses. So it takes a long time to work through 1.4 billion people.
*14:58.560- 15:02.040* :  You can't keep building houses forever. That's partly the problem as well.
*15:04.300- 15:11.220* :  Scientists have discovered the earliest and most distant galaxy ever observed. Using infrared
*15:11.220- 15:17.160* :  scanners aboard NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, they determined the collection of stars formed
*15:17.160- 15:26.260* :  just 290 million years after the big bang. So more than 13 billion years ago, astronomers say the
*15:26.260- 15:32.140* :  discovery has implications for our understanding of the dawn of the universe. Here's our science
*15:32.140- 15:38.340* :  correspondent Jonathan Amos. It's just a faint red smudge. But the detectors on the James Webb
*15:38.340- 15:43.860* :  Telescope are in no doubt that this galaxy, a large collection of stars, is at a prodigious
*15:43.860- 15:49.360* :  distance. Astronomers say the observatory is seeing the object where the universe was less than 300
*15:49.360- 15:55.860* :  million years old. Put another way, if the cosmos is 13.8 billion years old, James Webb is seeing
*15:55.860- 16:01.480* :  the galaxy where the universe was only 2% of its current age. The most interesting aspect of
*16:01.480- 16:06.520* :  the discovery is not the great distance, however. It's the galaxy's large size and brightness.
*16:07.040- 16:11.900* :  Researchers are struggling to explain the presence of so mature an object so early in the
*16:11.900- 16:16.540* :  nascent universe. Professor Catherine Hamons is the astronomer royal for Scotland.
*16:16.540- 16:22.400* :  We thought that we would see these early galaxies with this new telescope, but we didn't think
*16:22.400- 16:28.020* :  we'd see quite so many and that they'd be quite so bright. How has the universe managed to form
*16:28.020- 16:34.940* :  these quite big bright galaxies in just a couple of hundred million years? So back to the drawing
*16:34.940- 16:39.440* :  board for astronomers, we always like a good question, a good puzzle. When space agents who spent
*16:39.440- 16:45.980* :  $10 billion developing James Webb, they promised it would do remarkable things. Two years into
*16:45.980- 16:54.420* :  operations, that enormous investment is starting to pay back. Jonathan Amos. Still to come?
*17:00.460- 17:06.480* :  The four members of the legendary Swedish pop group ABBA have reunited to receive one of their

*18:21.020- 18:26.900* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. President Flodimir Zelenski has hailed the decision by some
*18:26.900- 18:32.720* :  of Ukraine's Western allies to allow his country's forces to hit Russian military targets
*18:33.460- 18:38.740* :  inside Russia on the border with the Harkiv region. Previously, Western countries supplying
*18:38.740- 18:43.460* :  weapons had done so on the condition that they weren't fired over the Ukraine Russia border.
*18:43.980- 18:48.560* :  But now in Germany, the US and others have said they believe a change in policy is necessary
*18:49.020- 18:55.520* :  as Russian forces continue to bombard Harkiv. A move President Lenski has long been calling for.
*18:56.100- 19:02.920* :  I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia, it's
*19:03.240- 19:08.760* :  questionable time. I think so. Otherwise, it's not about the just piece and they can
*19:08.760- 19:14.740* :  stage us on their territory through the border line just to take us and kill like it now is going on.
*19:15.600- 19:20.460* :  But there are still restrictions. President Biden says American supplied weapons can only be used
*19:20.460- 19:26.100* :  to hit targets in Russia near the Harkiv region. Given this, I also a security correspondent
*19:26.100- 19:30.860* :  Frank Gardner, how much of a difference this decision by Western allies could make?
*19:31.440- 19:37.560* :  Quite a lot. This is primarily about self-defense. We're not talking here about suddenly authorizing
*19:37.560- 19:44.720* :  Ukraine to hit the Kremlin or something like that. This is about providing Ukraine with the tools
*19:44.720- 19:50.560* :  to defend Harkiv. It's second city, which is getting absolutely pummeled. There's no doubt that
*19:50.560- 19:55.600* :  President Putin would like to take Harkiv. It will be their biggest success since the full-scale
*19:55.600- 20:01.500* :  invasion of February 22. They've made some incremental land gains, the Russians across that border.
*20:02.020- 20:05.860* :  But primarily, they're looking to put themselves in a position in fact, they already have done
*20:06.520- 20:11.680* :  where they can bombard Harkiv. And they're killing a lot of people every day, civilians.
*20:11.680- 20:17.220* :  And the Ukrainians complaint is that Russia is hiding behind its border, firing these drones,
*20:17.220- 20:21.980* :  missiles, and bombs at them, and they are not allowed to use Western supplied weapons to hit
*20:21.980- 20:30.060* :  back at them. So Germany, France, the UK, NATO, and now the US have all agreed that yes,
*20:30.060- 20:37.880* :  they can use them in self-defense. Now Moscow has, throughout the full-scale invasion, at each stage,
*20:37.880- 20:43.660* :  warned of terrible retribution of dangerous escalation, each time, for example, the West provided
*20:43.660- 20:49.440* :  men battle tanks or provided F-16s, which have yet to actually been deployed operationally,
*20:49.500- 20:55.680* :  or to provide long-range artillery. But all of those things have happened, and Russia hasn't yet
*20:55.680- 21:02.320* :  retaliated. And yet, Ukraine needs to hit back. It feels that it's been restricted, whereas Russia's
*21:02.320- 21:07.680* :  been able to get this help from North Korea, from Iran, and the use of dual-use technology from China,
*21:08.320- 21:12.700* :  this is a very difficult calculation for the West, isn't it, because it needs to avoid that
*21:12.700- 21:18.280* :  danger of escalation and the possibility of a wider war. But at the same time, it has to support
*21:18.280- 21:23.880* :  Ukraine to deter the Russians, and it's just a very, very complicated sort of balancing act it has
*21:23.880- 21:28.280* :  there. And that's why there are still these restrictions from the US in particular on the use of
*21:28.280- 21:33.160* :  long-range missiles. It's a game of brickmanship, and you're right, there's a lot of nuance involved
*21:33.580- 21:39.840* :  here. So the way Moscow sees it, Crimea is Russian territory, all those four oblasts that it is
*21:39.840- 21:46.120* :  invaded and partially occupied, Donetsk, Lohansk, Kherson, and Zaparizha, it considers to be a part of
*21:46.120- 21:51.000* :  the territory of the Russian Federation. That's not the way most of the rest of the world sees it.
*21:51.460- 21:58.040* :  So theoretically, those weapons that are already being deployed to hit Russian targets in those
*21:58.040- 22:04.080* :  occupied areas of Ukraine are hitting Russian soil. So you could say in a way, nothing is really
*22:04.080- 22:11.540* :  changing. What I think the West would be very keen to avoid is seeing not just Western supplied
*22:11.540- 22:19.380* :  weapons, but any powerful Ukrainian weapons being used to hit a strategic target, say Moscow,
*22:19.380- 22:25.860* :  the Kremlin. You know, Ukrainian drones are hitting Russian oil refineries deep within Russia.
*22:26.460- 22:31.200* :  The US doesn't like that because for a start it restricts the amount of refined oil that's
*22:31.200- 22:35.480* :  coming onto the world market and therefore drives prices up, which isn't good for US consumers at
*22:35.480- 22:42.160* :  the pumps, but it also worries it about escalation. So far, the West has called Putin's bluff,
*22:42.160- 22:47.460* :  and he's turned out to have a lot of empty threats. But sooner or later, the fear is I think he will
*22:47.460- 22:53.020* :  retaliate in some form. Frank Gardner, while Frank was talking there about the dangers of how the
*22:53.020- 22:58.100* :  Kremlin might react to this latest change in Western policy on Ukraine. With more of Moscow's
*22:58.100- 23:03.640* :  response, here's our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg talking to Nulema Governe. The reaction has
*23:03.640- 23:11.320* :  been quite angry from senior Russian officials, Dimitri Midvedev, who was former Russian president,
*23:11.320- 23:17.800* :  and now Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, he wrote on social media that Russia
*23:17.800- 23:24.700* :  views any long-range weapons passed to Ukraine by the West as weapons controlled by NATO personnel,
*23:24.700- 23:30.320* :  and therefore views NATO countries as participating in the war. He had this warning of Russian
*23:30.320- 23:36.880* :  retaliatory strikes on military hardware, on sites, soldiers in NATO countries, and he said that the
*23:36.880- 23:42.800* :  current armed conflict with the West is developing according to the worst case scenario, and he suggested
*23:42.800- 23:49.380* :  that, well, Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine saying this is not a nuclear
*23:49.380- 23:55.900* :  bluff. So that could be interpreted as a change of tone? Well, you have to remember that nuclear
*23:55.900- 24:02.000* :  saberattling is not new. I mean, we've heard so much of it over the last two years plus from Mr
*24:02.000- 24:07.540* :  Midvedev and from other Russian officials from President Putin as well, and you could construct an
*24:07.540- 24:14.280* :  argument that says they've been saying this kind of thing since the very beginning, so is this
*24:14.280- 24:19.060* :  simply a bluff? But I think the Russians in the last few days have been going out of the way
*24:19.060- 24:25.740* :  to try to make the argument that, no, this is not a bluff, that they could be put in a situation
*24:25.740- 24:33.280* :  where they have to respond. If you look at the language in the pro-Cremlin newspapers in recent days,
*24:33.280- 24:38.980* :  it has been shrill. There was a one tabloid today, Muscovsky comes to mollets, that wrote this
*24:38.980- 24:44.020* :  about how it thinks Russia should respond now to the West. It said, we need to hit them and hit
*24:44.020- 24:50.440* :  them hard. A shock is needed to sober up the enemy's brains, and it even suggested a Russian
*24:50.440- 24:56.320* :  military strike on a part of Poland to stop Western weapons getting to Ukraine. That is the kind of
*24:56.320- 25:03.300* :  thing you read about now in the Russian newspapers. Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. French security forces
*25:03.300- 25:07.900* :  say they've foiled an attack that was being planned for the Paris Olympics starting in late July
*25:07.900- 25:14.220* :  when millions of visitors are expected. France's Interior Minister Gerard Daimena said an 18-year-old
*25:14.220- 25:19.100* :  man of Chechen origin who was arrested earlier this month was believed to have been preparing an
*25:19.100- 25:23.760* :  attack at the stadium in St. Etienne during the football tournament. Muscovsky feels reports.
*25:24.620- 25:29.440* :  According to the Interior Ministry, initial evidence suggests he was planning an Islamist-inspired
*25:29.580- 25:34.800* :  attack in the main stadium at St. Etienne, which is where a number of Olympic football matches will
*25:34.800- 25:39.760* :  take place from late July. The Ministry said that the man planned to attack spectators and police
*25:39.760- 25:45.580* :  and hoped to die a martyr's death. French media report that the man was caught after exchanging
*25:45.580- 25:51.700* :  encrypted messages with known Islamists. Pictures and videos of the stadium were found on his phone
*25:51.700- 25:57.420* :  and computer. Interior Minister Gerard Daimena congratulated the intelligence services for this
*25:57.420- 26:04.200* :  first success in stopping a plot targeting the games. Muscovsky feels. Hackers are attempting to
*26:04.200- 26:09.760* :  sell what they say is confidential information on millions of customers and staff at Santander.
*26:09.760- 26:16.700* :  The Spanish bank confirmed that data had been stolen and apologized. The hackers called shiny hunters
*26:16.700- 26:23.200* :  claim to have bank account details for 30 million Santander clients in Spain, Uruguay and Chile.
*26:23.880- 26:28.280* :  This comes days after the gang claimed to have stolen the details of half a billion customers
*26:28.280- 26:35.080* :  of the US website ticketmaster. Some cyber experts say claims could be a publicity stunt by shiny
*26:35.080- 26:40.720* :  hunters to draw attention to a new hacking forum that was relaunched recently after being taken
*26:40.720- 26:46.160* :  down by police. For more on the hacking of Santander, David Harper spoke to our cyber correspondent
*26:46.160- 26:52.220* :  Joe Tidey. They're saying the hackers that they have managed to get the account details for 30
*26:52.220- 26:58.960* :  million different customers of Santander. They are in Chile, Spain and Uruguay. They've also said
*26:58.960- 27:05.280* :  that they have got all of the staff contact details and information of the global company,
*27:05.280- 27:10.460* :  which is obviously potentially a lot of people. That's 200,000 people worldwide. This could be
*27:10.460- 27:15.800* :  affecting a staff of Santander. The hackers are claiming that of that 30 million they've got six
*27:15.800- 27:21.600* :  million account numbers and balances. So I've been getting my black hat hacker hat on and working
*27:21.600- 27:26.780* :  out what can you do with that information. It doesn't take a big leap of the imagination to come
*27:26.780- 27:32.380* :  up with some pretty nasty secondary attacks if you know people's account numbers and their names
*27:32.380- 27:36.100* :  and how much money they've got in their accounts. And this has affected some of the bank services as
*27:36.140- 27:41.080* :  well? No, actually they're saying that all services are running as normal and they're having to
*27:41.080- 27:46.240* :  obviously this is a giant task for them to contact every one of those potential customers affected.
*27:46.740- 27:52.700* :  Santander has said that there has been a breach. They've confirmed the staff element of this hack,
*27:52.700- 27:58.020* :  but they haven't confirmed the number of customers. So we're still waiting on numbers from them.
*27:58.060- 28:04.180* :  And sometimes when these hackers go on hacking forums and start selling their data in batches,
*28:04.440- 28:09.540* :  they do exaggerate what they've got. And we're very wary of publicizing that. But in this case,
*28:09.540- 28:14.940* :  it is a pretty concerning situation for potentially millions. And it is partially confirmed,
*28:14.940- 28:19.760* :  of course, by Santander themselves. And this is in contrast to the story we were running this time
*28:19.760- 28:25.920* :  yesterday concerning the same hacking group who claimed we believe to have undertaken a similar
*28:25.920- 28:33.660* :  theft of data from a major ticket company. Yes, the ticket master hack was came out as a big new
*28:33.660- 28:41.600* :  story yesterday. That one in terms of numbers affected is far far more. That's 560 million people
*28:41.600- 28:45.540* :  around the world who could be according to the hackers affected by the ticket master breach.
*28:46.100- 28:49.640* :  But ticket master hasn't said anything. And we're all a little bit wary of that one because
*28:49.640- 28:54.640* :  there hasn't been any confirmation from official sources on that. But certainly if the same group
*28:54.760- 28:59.940* :  today has put overnight, they posted this Santander hack, which has proven to be at least partially
*28:59.940- 29:05.580* :  true, that does give some credence to this gang called shiny hunters. Yes, because there are
*29:05.580- 29:11.220* :  quite a prominent gang who have undertaken acts like this in the past. Yeah, that's right. They have
*29:11.220- 29:17.740* :  proven to have hacked in 2021. Lots of data, 70 million customer accounts were hacked in a breach,
*29:18.340- 29:23.820* :  which are they in AT&T that the American telecoms giant and they successfully sold that data
*29:23.820- 29:28.700* :  and it was all confirmed. So we do have to take them quite seriously that these hackers,
*29:29.300- 29:33.500* :  but at the same time, of course, there's also this strange situation now where they have
*29:33.900- 29:38.640* :  they are trying to sell these these giant sets of data for a lot of money. And they're very eye
*29:38.640- 29:44.000* :  catching sales and it's a brand new website that they have started themselves. So you've got to say,
*29:44.000- 29:47.780* :  well, hang on a minute, is this all part of some sort of publicity stand? And just very quickly,
*29:47.780- 29:52.320* :  if you're a customer of Santander or potentially a customer of ticket master, what's the best advice
*29:52.320- 29:58.580* :  at the moment? I would sit and I would wait for either ticket master if that is true or Santander,
*29:58.580- 30:03.760* :  if you're one of the customers affected by this to give you some advice. Don't panic, but they
*30:03.760- 30:08.000* :  will tell you what to do and that that might be a case of changing your bank details or your card,
*30:08.000- 30:12.080* :  you know, your credit cards and that kind of thing. But I'm afraid, yes, it's a case of sitting
*30:12.080- 30:17.320* :  and waiting and then be very, very vigilant of any suspicious phone calls or emails, that kind of thing.
*30:18.220- 30:24.240* :  Our cyber correspondent, Joe Tidey, a tiny firm has entered the Guinness World Records for having
*30:24.240- 30:31.520* :  the most DNA material of any living thing. DNA is like an instruction manual telling an organism
*30:31.520- 30:37.480* :  how to live and survive. Scientists say that when unraveled the plants genome would reach more
*30:37.480- 30:43.940* :  than a hundred meters, that's 50 times more than that of humans. More details from Helen Briggs.
*30:44.820- 30:50.140* :  This rare tropical plant is found only in New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean and on a few
*30:50.140- 30:55.600* :  neighbouring islands. It belongs to a group of little known ferns that have been around since before
*30:55.600- 31:02.460* :  the time of the dinosaurs. Though tiny, its genetic material, or genome, is 50 times bigger than
*31:02.460- 31:07.660* :  our own and it's now been recognised by Guinness World Records as having the largest genome,
*31:07.660- 31:14.440* :  the largest plant genome and the largest fern genome. But big isn't always better when it comes to
*31:14.440- 31:21.440* :  DNA. Dr. Ileach of the Royal Botanic Gardens Q says plants with large genomes are less nimble
*31:21.440- 31:27.520* :  at adapting to change. You've got to be able to replicate all that DNA and if you're trying to
*31:27.520- 31:33.600* :  replicate over a hundred meters of DNA in each cell versus species with tiny genomes, it might be
*31:33.600- 31:39.740* :  only a few centimetres of DNA, that takes the whole lot longer. So plants with bigger genomes are
*31:39.740- 31:45.640* :  restricted to growing slower. Ultimate is that we think it also impacts extinction risk.
*31:46.080- 31:51.420* :  Dr. Ileach says the study will help inform conservation efforts in the face of threats from
*31:51.420- 31:57.840* :  biodiversity loss and climate change and highlights the amazing diversity within the plant kingdom.
*31:58.580- 32:04.100* :  Helen Briggs, 50 years after they made pop history by winning the Eurovision Song contest with
*32:04.100- 32:09.680* :  their song Waterloo, the start of a long line of hits, the four members of ABBA have had a rare
*32:09.960- 32:14.680* :  reunion. They were back together to receive one of Sweden's top honours at the Royal Palace
*32:14.680- 32:19.260* :  in Stockholm from King Karl Gustaf. Stephanie Zacherson has the details.
*32:32.220- 32:37.000* :  With pomp and sacraments and the ABBA before were handed a thank you for the music. King
*32:37.000- 32:43.080* :  Gustaf said the recipients were an inspiration to others and for future generations. As the awards
*32:43.080- 32:48.340* :  for very distinguished contributions within Swedish and international music life were given
*32:48.340- 32:54.060* :  to the pop stars, Sweden this year resumed the awarding of the Shiver Rewarders after a 50-year
*32:54.060- 32:59.320* :  pause, fittingly coinciding with the 50-year anniversary of ABBA's win in the Eurovision
*32:59.320- 33:04.160* :  Song contest with Waterloo, which catapulted them into global fame.
*33:10.940- 33:16.500* :  The Royal Order of Vaza was created in the 1700s. The decision of who receives it is made by
*33:16.500- 33:20.640* :  the government and parliament, but its members of the public who put forward suggestions,
*33:21.440- 33:26.480* :  so it might not have been that big of a surprise that beyond Bernie, Agnietta and
*33:26.480- 33:33.600* :  Annifred were nominated. I think it's amazing that we've been given this prize.
*33:33.600- 33:40.140* :  I feel very honoured and it does make me think of the 1970s and how the other musician said we
*33:40.140- 33:45.800* :  were too commercial. I'm feeling great today and I'm sure some of these people would have loved
*33:45.800- 33:51.640* :  to be in our place. Since their breakthrough year of the 70s and their split in the early 80s,
*33:51.960- 33:59.380* :  ABBA have sold an estimated 385 million records. Their music has spawned the hit musical Mamamia,
*33:59.380- 34:05.680* :  two blockbuster movies and the holographic performance ABBA voyage. Although they are still good
*34:05.680- 34:11.380* :  friends, they're rarely seen in public together, but Benny Andersson says it was an easy decision
*34:11.380- 34:20.740* :  to reunite for this event. It feels really, really good and we thought this was so nice. We
*34:20.740- 34:28.000* :  talked to it over and said that we had to come all four of us. That was ABBA's Benny Andersson
*34:28.000- 34:35.880* :  ending that report by Stephanie Zachrisson. And that's all from us for now, but there will be
