*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:29.380- 01:35.120* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 20th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:35.740- 01:40.460* :  Kenya's security forces clash with hundreds of protesters opposed to planned tax rises.
*01:40.460- 01:46.900* :  A day after signing a defence agreement with North Korea, Russia's president Vladimir Putin visits Fiat Nam.
*01:47.620- 01:51.500* :  More than 1,000 people are reported to have died during this year's hard pilgrimage
*01:51.500- 01:54.520* :  as temperatures in Saudi Arabia top 50 degrees.
*01:57.080- 02:01.260* :  Also in this podcast, the new treatment that leaves you more active than you were before,
*02:01.260- 02:02.360* :  your heart attack.
*02:02.920- 02:08.260* :  And the British musician Ratman on his new Netflix show about superheroes in South London.
*02:08.680- 02:13.060* :  I just never understood someone getting superpowers and the first thing they do is get a cape,
*02:13.260- 02:16.000* :  spandex and stop a bridge from falling down.
*02:16.140- 02:20.040* :  If I've got powers, that wouldn't be my first move, so let's start there.
*02:25.160- 02:28.560* :  We begin this podcast on the streets of the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
*02:33.380- 02:37.280* :  To your guest, canisters, exploding as protesters chant, we are peaceful,
*02:37.280- 02:43.020* :  expressing their opposition to government plans to raise more than $2.5 billion in new taxes.
*02:43.700- 02:47.300* :  The demonstrators, many of them young and armed only with their smart phones,
*02:47.300- 02:51.300* :  were confronted by riot police, someone horseback and water cannon.
*02:51.780- 02:53.100* :  This was the view of one of them.
*03:06.160- 03:09.560* :  For the latest on the situation, I've been speaking to our deputy-Africa editor,
*03:09.840- 03:11.460* :  Ansoy, who's in Nairobi.
*03:13.200- 03:16.700* :  Our own strategy with the protests, we used to protest following one street.
*03:17.160- 03:20.960* :  They're in all streets trying to get to Parliament, which has been cordoned off,
*03:21.280- 03:24.680* :  as MPs continue with the debate on their controversial finance bill.
*03:24.920- 03:28.100* :  They've just been behind me, they have now been pushed back,
*03:28.260- 03:30.120* :  there are two water cannons behind me.
*03:30.120- 03:33.920* :  You can hear the tear gas canisters going off in another direction.
*03:34.080- 03:39.040* :  So it's quite dramatic out here today, and it is not just Nairobi.
*03:39.560- 03:42.020* :  These protests began in Nairobi on Tuesday,
*03:42.020- 03:45.120* :  and they have now spread across the country to various towns,
*03:45.120- 03:49.020* :  including the president's own hometown of Eldorate in Western Kenya.
*03:49.560- 03:51.120* :  Now, we just heard from one protestor there,
*03:51.620- 03:55.780* :  that what they are saying is it's a perfectly legitimate thing to protest about.
*03:55.780- 04:02.020* :  They're protesting their increase or their introduction of taxes on goods that they consider
*04:02.020- 04:06.020* :  basic commodities like sundry towels and diapers.
*04:06.820- 04:09.120* :  On Tuesday, the government gave some concessions,
*04:09.120- 04:15.000* :  including scrapping of 16% value at the tax that they had imposed on bread.
*04:15.000- 04:17.960* :  They scrapped motovieco taxes as well,
*04:18.160- 04:21.400* :  but then the protestors are saying they have not gone far enough.
*04:21.940- 04:25.040* :  The government, on the other hand, is saying that they have to raise revenues somehow.
*04:25.040- 04:29.100* :  The economy is under pressure because of a huge debt burden.
*04:29.100- 04:33.720* :  More than 60% of the government's revenue goes to repaying loans,
*04:33.720- 04:38.060* :  and therefore they have to look for ways to raise more money from people,
*04:38.060- 04:41.820* :  but the Gen Zs are out here saying that they've had enough.
*04:42.200- 04:44.880* :  The cost of living is too high. They're suffocating under it.
*04:45.120- 04:47.920* :  Obviously, the protest is noisy, and there are a lot of people there.
*04:48.380- 04:51.020* :  Is it your sense that you need to respond to this kind of thing
*04:51.020- 04:55.640* :  with riot police, police on horseback, canisters of tear gas, that kind of thing?
*04:56.520- 04:59.440* :  That's traditionally how Kenyan police have dealt with protests,
*04:59.980- 05:03.560* :  which is why you're hearing the chance there in that clip that you played,
*05:04.140- 05:05.960* :  with the Gen Zs saying, no, we are peaceful.
*05:05.960- 05:09.060* :  We don't come with stones. We're not hauling stones. We're not looting.
*05:09.060- 05:12.580* :  And if anyone attempts to do that, we are going to arrest them ourselves.
*05:12.580- 05:17.120* :  So they're trying to do it differently, but they're meeting a force
*05:17.120- 05:21.440* :  that is traditionally used to using excessive force to crush protests.
*05:22.200- 05:24.980* :  And it doesn't feel just from listening to what's going on around you
*05:24.980- 05:29.120* :  and hearing your description, Anne, like this is going to be brought to an end anytime soon.
*05:30.520- 05:33.500* :  No, it doesn't look like that. And, you know, they're resolute.
*05:33.940- 05:39.820* :  I have watched them being sprayed with that itchy liquid from water canons several times.
*05:40.420- 05:42.860* :  They, they've been passing within minutes. They're back.
*05:43.320- 05:45.940* :  You know, they have overwhelmed police in some instances.
*05:46.400- 05:49.060* :  But the, the police are trying to keep them away from parliament.
*05:49.720- 05:52.020* :  That was our deputy, Africa editor Anne Sawyer,
*05:52.020- 05:54.540* :  made those noisy protests in Nairobi.
*05:55.260- 05:58.980* :  Next to Vietnam, the latest country to roll out the red carpet
*05:58.980- 06:01.060* :  for the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
*06:06.840- 06:09.060* :  Military bans play the Russian national anthem.
*06:09.060- 06:13.380* :  As Mr Putin shook hands with dignitaries at a ceremony in the capital Hanoi,
*06:13.640- 06:18.800* :  this one day after signing that mutual defense pact with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
*06:19.340- 06:21.500* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent, Jonathan Head,
*06:21.500- 06:24.060* :  has been monitoring Mr Putin's tour of the region.
*06:24.480- 06:28.480* :  Of course, Vietnam in some ways is a much bigger prize for him than North Korea.
*06:28.480- 06:30.460* :  North Korea is a fellow pariah state.
*06:30.940- 06:34.060* :  No one's too surprised that those two countries should be thrown together.
*06:34.060- 06:37.120* :  But as you, you would have seen from the American reaction,
*06:37.120- 06:41.880* :  they're very displeased that their new friend Vietnam that they've been wooing
*06:41.880- 06:47.000* :  is rolling out the red carpet from Mr Putin and giving him all the kind of pomp and
*06:47.000- 06:53.020* :  and sort of welcome that President Biden got last year on his groundbreaking visit to Vietnam.
*06:53.680- 06:56.040* :  But that is the nature of Vietnam's foreign policy,
*06:56.040- 06:59.540* :  which is strictly nonpartisan neutral.
*06:59.540- 07:02.620* :  They like to be friends with all enemies of none.
*07:02.620- 07:06.520* :  And remember the very strong historical ties between the two countries.
*07:07.000- 07:12.760* :  Whatever Vietnam thinks of Mr Putin, Vietnam has a very strong sense of historical obligation
*07:13.460- 07:17.000* :  to Russia and the former Soviet Union for all the help it gave Vietnam
*07:17.660- 07:20.060* :  in those long years that it was fighting the French and the Americans.
*07:20.060- 07:22.940* :  And even after that, those things will not be forgotten.
*07:22.940- 07:27.120* :  And Vietnam has ignored the American process and is giving this to Putin.
*07:27.180- 07:29.060* :  I think you're welcome. He will really appreciate.
*07:29.140- 07:34.120* :  He's on a bid to make himself look as though he is not without friends.
*07:34.120- 07:37.600* :  And Vietnam is certainly giving the impression that he's a very old friend.
*07:38.160- 07:42.100* :  Neutrality on the war in Ukraine is clearly a pretty big prize for Russia.
*07:42.720- 07:44.700* :  What's the art Vietnam going to get out of this?
*07:44.700- 07:48.780* :  They're having talks about trade and military equipment and energy and all those things.
*07:48.780- 07:50.540* :  What does Vietnam want out of this?
*07:50.880- 07:52.640* :  Look, there isn't very much of substance.
*07:52.640- 07:56.100* :  It wants things that it already has with Russia to continue.
*07:56.100- 07:59.120* :  That is reliable supplies of military equipment.
*07:59.180- 08:02.700* :  Vietnam's armed forces are almost entirely supplied by Russian equipment.
*08:03.280- 08:06.120* :  That's a worry because they've been worrying about it for some time.
*08:06.120- 08:10.140* :  And obviously the Ukraine was made even more worrying about how long they can depend on that.
*08:10.140- 08:11.740* :  And they are looking for alternatives.
*08:11.800- 08:17.120* :  They also want continued Russian engagement in oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea.
*08:17.140- 08:21.060* :  A tricky issue because those areas contested with China.
*08:21.520- 08:23.540* :  China of course has a lot of leverage over Russia.
*08:23.900- 08:25.920* :  But these aren't essential things for Vietnam.
*08:25.920- 08:26.940* :  They're important to it.
*08:27.280- 08:34.620* :  What really matters to Vietnam is that it is seen to be positioning itself equidistantly from all the big powers it has to deal with.
*08:35.160- 08:42.480* :  I'm not sure that Vietnam was entirely happy about President Putin coming right on the backs of going to see Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
*08:43.060- 08:45.760* :  But they were not going to neglect him when he wanted to come.
*08:45.800- 08:49.540* :  They were going to make it clear they won't be told by anybody who their friends are.
*08:49.860- 08:53.120* :  That's the nature of Vietnam's foreign policy and they're going to stick to that.
*08:53.420- 08:54.440* :  Comes with risks though.
*08:54.440- 08:59.300* :  It's just going to say putting yourself on a list with North Korea and not that many other countries.
*08:59.860- 09:01.760* :  It carries its own diplomatic risks.
*09:02.040- 09:03.900* :  It does have risks and they're aware of that.
*09:03.900- 09:08.440* :  We'll have to see how long Vietnam can keep up this balancing act.
*09:08.440- 09:14.380* :  But you know, whatever the Americans say, at the moment, America perhaps needs Vietnam more than Vietnam needs the US.
*09:14.960- 09:16.580* :  Vietnam does need the markets in the US.
*09:16.580- 09:17.920* :  It does not want to give up on those.
*09:18.360- 09:23.340* :  You know, I think whatever the risks are, Vietnam has shown it can pull off this balancing act up to now.
*09:23.340- 09:25.640* :  Well, the world's a tricky place now and things could change.
*09:26.340- 09:28.940* :  I saw the station correspondent Jonathan head with me.
*09:29.500- 09:36.540* :  A landmark legal judgment from the Supreme Court in the UK could stop future fossil fuel projects from going ahead.
*09:36.540- 09:46.300* :  Its rule that a local council in South East England should have considered the climate impacts of burning the oil extracted from a well when it gave the initial planning permission.
*09:46.300- 09:49.100* :  The story from our climate editor Justin Rolas.
*09:49.740- 09:56.840* :  This judgment by a three to two majority is likely to have a significant impact on future fossil fuel projects in the UK.
*09:57.520- 10:01.680* :  It means as well as considering the immediate impact of a new fossil fuel development,
*10:01.680- 10:06.540* :  local authorities will now have to consider the downstream emissions as well.
*10:06.940- 10:10.560* :  All the carbon dioxide the fuel will produce when it is burned.
*10:10.560- 10:22.160* :  Campaigners claim the judgment could block new fossil fuel projects including the massive rose bank oil fill off the Shatland Islands and the proposed coal mine in Whitehaven in Cumbria 2.
*10:22.160- 10:26.120* :  Today's judgment relates to the horse hill oil well in Surrey.
*10:26.120- 10:37.080* :  The 3.3 million tons of crude oil it was predicted to produce over the next 20 years would have created over 10 million tons of CO2 according to Friends of the Earth.
*10:37.480- 10:41.720* :  By the standards of international fossil fuel developments that is tiny.
*10:42.180- 10:47.620* :  But the repercussions of today's ruling could reshape the UK's energy future.
*10:48.320- 10:52.740* :  Now let's talk about the extreme hot weather in different parts of the world at the moment.
*10:52.740- 10:59.120* :  You may have heard in our earlier Global News podcast about hundreds of people reported to have died during this year's
*10:59.120- 11:04.160* :  hard pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia temperatures in Mecca exceeding 50 degrees.
*11:04.960- 11:07.500* :  Many countries have now confirmed the deaths of their citizens.
*11:07.500- 11:11.820* :  The Indonesian authorities say nearly 200 of their nationals died.
*11:11.820- 11:18.900* :  Unconfirmed reports suggest total deaths may exceed 900 but Saudi Arabia hasn't given official figures.
*11:19.520- 11:23.380* :  This pilgrim from Nigeria Aisha Idris says she was lucky to survive.
*11:24.020- 11:28.440* :  The sun was really on us because even me is by the mercy of God that I survived it.
*11:28.800- 11:34.360* :  Your throat would be dried so I have to be hydrating myself with water and be pouring water on my head.
*11:34.360- 11:35.500* :  That is what made me survive.
*11:35.500- 11:37.920* :  Because at the point I said I'm going to faint.
*11:38.440- 11:42.800* :  Somebody has to assist me with umbrella because I don't know that the heat will reach that level.
*11:43.300- 11:46.340* :  A severe unrelenting heat wave continues across India.
*11:46.860- 11:53.700* :  Since March the country has recorded more than 100 temperature-related deaths and 40,000 suspected cases of heat stroke.
*11:54.300- 11:57.800* :  Our South Asia correspondent in Delhi, Samir Hussein has been telling me more.
*11:58.240- 12:03.780* :  There has been a heat wave in India in parts of the country for several weeks now.
*12:03.780- 12:07.140* :  In fact it's probably one of the longest heat waves that we have seen.
*12:07.140- 12:18.200* :  North India where I am right now in the capital of New Delhi on average the temperatures are 6-8 degrees hotter than they normally are for the month of June.
*12:18.200- 12:27.000* :  And you have other parts of the country even in North India where the temperatures have hit over 50 degrees Celsius.
*12:27.580- 12:43.860* :  So these are really extremely hot temperatures and making it really quite deadly for people is that there's large parts of the country that depend on migrant labor or that people have to work outside in this kind of heat.
*12:43.860- 12:48.380* :  Or you have the elderly that are much more susceptible to these temperatures.
*12:48.380- 12:57.600* :  And that's how you have these really severe instances of heat stroke and there have been quite a few deaths around the country just in this last week.
*12:57.600- 13:09.820* :  But if you take into consideration how long this heat wave has been going there's been several hundred documented deaths because of the heat but then remember there's so many more that go unreported.
*13:10.140- 13:21.440* :  And another aspect we've talked about in the program already is that schools have been closed because it's not been deemed to be safe for children to be confined in classrooms and therefore children have been at home.
*13:22.720- 13:32.840* :  That's right because remember many schools don't have any air conditioning and schools don't also have enough fans or enough electricity.
*13:32.880- 13:43.040* :  And so it's more dangerous for students to be inside these classrooms that can get extremely hot so better that students are at home.
*13:43.040- 13:50.060* :  But you can see that you know that's just one impact of these kinds of extreme temperatures that have just on students.
*13:50.060- 13:55.160* :  And then of course there are those that are forced to work outside the impact is even greater.
*13:55.780- 14:06.780* :  We're seeing extreme heat in many parts of the world. We've had people losing their lives on Greek islands. We've had people losing their lives in the Middle East during their harsh pilgrimage in Mecca.
*14:07.220- 14:13.440* :  How does the situation in India compare to what would normally happen at this time of year when it would normally be hot?
*14:14.400- 14:20.700* :  It would normally be hot but you wouldn't see these kinds of prolonged extreme temperatures.
*14:20.700- 14:36.640* :  In fact I was at a local government hospital just yesterday and the head of the hospital was saying to us that look you know just in this month of June we've seen 45 heat related patients come into this hospital.
*14:36.640- 14:46.980* :  There's been a dramatic increase just in the last few days and they have seen just in the last two days at least five people have died because of heat related injuries.
*14:46.980- 14:55.040* :  Now remember that's just one government hospital in central Delhi and this is a scene that's being repeated absolutely everywhere.
*14:55.580- 14:57.260* :  So it's really very dangerous.
*14:57.580- 15:00.160* :  Our correspondent Samira Hussein with me from Delhi.
*15:00.820- 15:06.260* :  Can patients recovering from a heart attack go on to have a more active life than they did before?
*15:06.900- 15:12.940* :  New research in Austria suggests so especially say gentle shock waves can regenerate heart tissue.
*15:12.940- 15:20.620* :  This study found those who had given the treatment were able to walk longer distances a year later and their hearts were able to pump more blood.
*15:21.060- 15:22.800* :  Here's our health correspondent Jim Reed.
*15:23.440- 15:29.120* :  58 year old Josef is being wheeled off to theatre for a heart bypass operation.
*15:30.960- 15:36.480* :  Like millions around the world he lives with heart disease and last year it all came to a head.
*15:37.040- 15:42.560* :  I felt a stab of pain that moved into my left hand.
*15:43.600- 15:44.640* :  Then I was short of breath.
*15:45.320- 15:49.660* :  I had this kind of fear of death where you don't know what to do next and what's going to happen.
*15:51.220- 15:56.240* :  But today Josef will have some unusual treatment as part of his surgery.
*15:56.740- 16:04.800* :  The doctors at this Austrian hospital will apply mild shock waves to his damaged heart to help it regenerate.
*16:06.280- 16:16.200* :  This handheld machine is designed to deliver sound waves setting off a chain reaction inside the tissue and stimulating the growth of new blood vessels.
*16:16.860- 16:22.420* :  Your Hannah's Whole Felds is the surgeon about to perform this new treatment.
*16:23.700- 16:29.820* :  So what I do now is take the heart, the beating heart and we can now start please.
*16:31.260- 16:38.960* :  This is a patient with a severely reduced heart function due to chronically undersupplied heart muscle.
*16:39.720- 16:47.040* :  And with shockwave therapy we can induce the formation of new blood vessel and thereby the heart muscle gets strengthened.
*16:48.140- 16:57.220* :  In a trial of 63 patients those who had the new therapy were able to recover more quickly and their hearts pumped more blood.
*16:57.220- 17:10.380* :  They can walk much much longer than they did before treatment and this for patients means that they are able again to go out for a walk with the dog or to go to the supermarket care for their everyday life.
*17:10.820- 17:15.020* :  This really makes a difference for their quality of life.
*17:16.260- 17:21.580* :  Marcus had bypass surgery after his heart attack and took parts in the clinical trials.
*17:24.340- 17:27.300* :  Today I actually don't have any breathing restrictions anymore.
*17:27.460- 17:34.360* :  I can do sports, I can go hiking, I can go into the mountains and the condition for me is the way it was before the heart attack.
*17:36.180- 17:41.740* :  Shockwaves are already used in other parts of medicine such as healing skin wounds.
*17:42.960- 17:49.820* :  The team in Austria plan to carry out more trials and offer their device to hospitals across Europe next year.
*17:50.420- 17:52.400* :  Our health correspondent Jim Reid reporting.
*17:55.060- 18:01.960* :  Coming up on the global news podcast we'll hear the fears of a Sudanese woman whose parents are trapped in the besiege city of Elfasha.
*18:02.500- 18:07.520* :  They start listing the relatives or the people that we know who died in the injured.
*18:07.740- 18:16.600* :  What house have been destroyed and what happened and you know like in them you just hear this like do the bombing and the sounds of the bullets spread.
*18:16.600- 18:17.980* :  They say we are fine and everything.
*18:26.400- 18:31.920* :  One size fits all seems like a good idea for clothes until you try them on. Same goes for health care.
*18:32.140- 18:40.220* :  That's why United Health Care offers flexible, budget-friendly coverage for medical, vision, dental and more. Learn more at UH1.com.
*18:41.180- 18:47.840* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*18:47.840- 18:55.740* :  They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts they said what the f**k are you talking about?
*18:55.760- 18:57.340* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*19:16.560- 19:23.420* :  More than 35 people have died and many more are in hospital in southern India after they consumed illegally brewed liquor.
*19:23.920- 19:28.880* :  Police have arrested a man for selling illicit liquor and also seized a methanol mixed alcoholic drink.
*19:28.880- 19:32.620* :  This from our South Asia regional editor and barrison etherargin.
*19:33.220- 19:37.800* :  Those who drank the toxic liquor suffered from vomiting, stomachache and diarrhea.
*19:38.300- 19:43.600* :  More than 100 people have been admitted to hospitals in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
*19:44.040- 19:47.480* :  The condition of some of those in hospital is said to be critical.
*19:48.060- 19:51.280* :  10 police officers have been suspended over the incident.
*19:51.280- 19:58.760* :  Writing on social media the chief minister of Tamil Nadu MK Stalin said he was shocked and saddened by the news.
*19:59.360- 20:06.840* :  Though drinking is legal in many Indian states, Montrain alcohol is popular as it is cheaper than legally made liquor.
*20:07.640- 20:09.080* :  Next let's go to Peru.
*20:14.440- 20:24.200* :  This is the sound of celebrations outside a courthouse in Lima after it jailed a group of retired soldiers for raping teenage girls in the 1980s and 90s.
*20:24.600- 20:29.200* :  The 10 men carried out the abuse during the army's long-running conflict against Maoist rebels.
*20:29.200- 20:32.360* :  They've been sentenced to up to 12 years in prison.
*20:32.920- 20:36.240* :  Our Latin America online editor Vanessa Bushluter told me more.
*20:36.580- 20:48.220* :  What they were found guilty of was not just raping those women and teenage girls but of doing so systematically and repeatedly in order to so terror amongst a civilian population.
*20:48.480- 20:52.120* :  And this has been considered a crime against humanity.
*20:52.140- 21:12.620* :  And that's why you heard those cheers there because the human rights groups that backed this case have really found that this case is a historic one where the sexual violence committed by the security forces against a civilian population and specifically against indigenous women has been recognized.
*21:13.140- 21:21.920* :  This would be a big enough story in its own right but the reaction comes with this hinterland of what it tells us about the history of the place.
*21:22.600- 21:30.660* :  Absolutely. Not only has it taken decades to reach this point but also there has been very mixed feelings.
*21:30.660- 21:40.360* :  We heard women cheering there because these soldiers have been sentenced but some of the survivors have described more mixed feelings.
*21:40.360- 21:42.520* :  One of them is Virginia Gonzalez.
*21:46.800- 21:53.800* :  None of those accused showed up in court. They are cowards. We have fought for 20 years. The sentence is just too short.
*21:54.420- 22:00.220* :  Look at them. Some will spend no more than eight years in jail. Others six. That's too little for us.
*22:00.600- 22:06.420* :  Now these are by no means the only abuses from that period. Are the more legal proceedings to come?
*22:07.180- 22:19.120* :  Absolutely not the only abuses committed. Truth Commission report found that 5,000 cases of rape had been reported during those years of the armed conflict in Peru.
*22:19.120- 22:25.660* :  And those are only the ones that have been reported. But these groups have a fear as well now.
*22:25.660- 22:49.540* :  They obviously hope that this will set a precedent for other cases to be brought to trial but a bill is making its way through Congress at the moment which has been dubbed an amnesty bill which would allow especially people from the military and the police force to evade going to trial for any alleged crimes committed before the year 2002.
*22:50.240- 22:57.340* :  So many groups are very worried about this including international courts which have expressed their concern about this.
*22:57.720- 23:09.900* :  Vanessa Bushleusa reporting to sit down now where human rights watchers call for an international peacekeeping mission to protect civilians in the western region of Darfur and especially in the city of Elfasha.
*23:10.560- 23:16.640* :  The paramilitary rapid support forces have been fighting the Sudanese army across the country since April last year.
*23:17.240- 23:24.560* :  Elfasha is one of the flashpoints in the wider war that's created the world's worst humanitarian crisis with millions at risk of famine.
*23:25.020- 23:29.660* :  8 million people have been displaced with seemingly no prospect of a ceasefire.
*23:29.660- 23:40.120* :  It's pretty hard to communicate with people in Elfasha. My colleague James Cotnell has been talking to Tanzel in the Ugandan capital Campala who's from Elfasha and has family there.
*23:40.560- 23:45.440* :  And a word of warning you might find some of the description about what her family have been going through upsetting.
*23:46.100- 23:55.020* :  Visiting my entire family there in Elfasha my parents and my my grandmothers and my cousin who are all of us grew up together so they're still there now.
*23:55.620- 24:03.940* :  It's obviously a very terrifying situation in Elfasha right now. Are you able to communicate with them from time to time?
*24:04.900- 24:19.720* :  No, it's not easy to communicate with them actually because they cut all the internet connections and everything so people now they have to go to this startling spots where they can just buy Wi-Fi or buy like internet for a while, a couple of minutes and then.
*24:20.460- 24:28.460* :  But it's not easy to reach them actually because it's been like a maybe once a week or maybe once every time the Wi-Fi spots is very far and it's very expensive.
*24:28.860- 24:36.240* :  And when you do manage to get a message from your parents or from another family member what sort of thing are they telling you?
*24:36.620- 24:41.820* :  They start listing the relatives or the people that we know who died in the injured.
*24:42.680- 24:48.620* :  And then what house have been destroyed and what happened and you know like and then you just you hear this like do.
*24:54.200- 24:58.700* :  So you can hear the explosions behind them when the message comes through very clearly.
*24:59.360- 25:04.140* :  And I wonder what that is like for you it must be incredibly difficult hearing those messages.
*25:05.400- 25:10.580* :  Yeah, you know, they just tell you that we are safe or just taking cover or maybe laying down in the ground and something.
*25:10.580- 25:19.480* :  So as long as they're talking maybe they're in a safe place, but I worry more when when I don't hear from them because you never know.
*25:19.880- 25:27.440* :  So basically since like the past maybe three or four or four weeks, we are all just like prepared to hear something but maybe like my dad is dead.
*25:27.820- 25:30.460* :  Some was very, very, very I know that and it happened.
*25:31.300- 25:33.020* :  I mean my mom loves her brother like him.
*25:34.380- 25:42.940* :  When we could go and he was dead for two days and nobody knew about that because there's no internet connection even his family they don't know and they start searching for the hospital.
*25:42.940- 25:51.400* :  So everything and then it happened that a sniper shot him with another military like a soldier and then the military people they took his body and they buried him.
*25:52.220- 25:59.860* :  So it was not easy to find him basically nobody knew we didn't even give him like this proper burial a guy from the military told him that yeah we found this guy.
*25:59.860- 26:01.740* :  He was dead next to one of our soldiers.
*26:01.860- 26:05.960* :  So we took them and bury him because he was already dead and everything so that's it.
*26:06.240- 26:06.860* :  He just died.
*26:07.220- 26:08.260* :  I'm so sorry to hear that.
*26:08.620- 26:10.120* :  Yeah, I'm sorry for my mom.
*26:11.340- 26:14.900* :  And that was Tanzel who was speaking to James Copmore from Campala.
*26:15.980- 26:21.980* :  From 2025 school classrooms in the American state of Louisiana will have to display the ten commandments.
*26:22.620- 26:26.640* :  The biblical laws must be written on a poster which children can read easily.
*26:27.200- 26:32.540* :  Louisiana is the first US state to pass such a measure which civil rights groups are expected to challenge.
*26:33.120- 26:35.500* :  Here's our North America correspondent Will Vernon.
*26:36.360- 26:48.020* :  Louisiana's controversial new law says that all state educational institutions from nursery schools to universities must have the ten commandments on display by the start of next year.
*26:48.600- 26:53.780* :  The state's governor Jeff Landry claimed the commandments contained valuable lessons for students.
*26:54.420- 27:05.100* :  This bill mandates the display of the ten commandments in every classroom in public, elementary, secondary and post education schools in a state of Louisiana.
*27:08.940- 27:15.120* :  Because if you want to respect the rule of law you got to start from the original law given which was Moses.
*27:15.140- 27:25.180* :  But the bill will almost certainly be challenged in court as the US Constitution explicitly prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another.
*27:25.740- 27:38.640* :  In a statement a coalition of three civil rights groups criticized the new law saying it would prevent students from getting an equal education and will make children who have different beliefs feel unsafe at school.
*27:39.520- 27:48.480* :  Conservative Republicans from states in the so-called Bible Belt have made a number of attempts to bolster public expressions of the Christian faith in recent years.
*27:48.980- 27:58.740* :  Three other states, Texas, Oklahoma and Utah have tried to pass similar measures to display the ten commandments in classrooms but none of them made it into law.
*28:00.160- 28:08.860* :  The ancient monument Stonehenge in southern England is often in the news at this time of year because crowds go there to celebrate the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.
*28:09.540- 28:16.380* :  This year as we reported in an earlier podcast it's been sprayed with an orange substance by climate change activists.
*28:16.500- 28:22.960* :  The protesters from the pressure group Just Stop Oil insist they use corn flour so it will wash off in the rain.
*28:23.540- 28:29.620* :  Nick Merrimon is from English Heritage the organization that manages Stonehenge so what did he make of the protests?
*28:30.380- 28:37.620* :  We found them deeply saddening. It's a vandalism to one of the world's most celebrated ancient monuments.
*28:37.620- 28:52.140* :  Stonehenge is about 5,000 years old. What we find difficult to understand is that people in those ancient times were living so sustainably and the stones are a testament to the desire of people to connect with nature and the earth and the sun.
*28:52.300- 29:03.100* :  The moon as well as each other so it's difficult to understand and we're deeply saddened about this vandalism but we've been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we've had.
*29:03.640- 29:14.220* :  Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water but so far there seems to be no visible damage.
*29:14.220- 29:18.340* :  The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow.
*29:19.460- 29:28.320* :  Finally the British musician and screenwriter Rap Man has racked up millions of online views and track place with his socially conscious storytelling and rap.
*29:28.840- 29:37.800* :  He is a superhero to many of his followers which is why his new Netflix series Super Cell about South London superheroes is so eagerly awaited.
*29:40.140- 29:45.780* :  I can move things about touching them. I don't think you should be using your powers for personal gain.
*29:48.060- 29:53.260* :  There's a matter of life and death. If the fireball was up together we can stop this. You're asking for too much.
*29:53.360- 29:55.620* :  Hey you're not listening to me. I can't use you.
*29:59.140- 30:03.820* :  Rap Man is the creator, director and executive producer. He told us how he came up with a show.
*30:04.280- 30:12.380* :  I think first of all it was I didn't approach it as a superhero show. I'm more approached as a show about normal people with superpowers.
*30:13.100- 30:18.300* :  I think someone with superpowers is very different in my opinion than actual superheroes putting on a cape.
*30:19.060- 30:24.520* :  I watch a lot of these shows with superheroes as you say in there.
*30:24.520- 30:32.700* :  I just never understood someone getting superpowers and the first thing they do is get a cape, spandex and stop a bridge from falling down.
*30:32.700- 30:39.720* :  If I got powers that wouldn't be my first use. Let's start there and we built from there really.
*30:39.960- 30:47.320* :  You might do something socially useful instead. There's a lot of movies that have tried over the years but it's still pretty rare.
*30:47.760- 30:49.120* :  Why was that important to you?
*30:49.660- 31:02.200* :  I just feel like you don't really see a lot of all blacks or any ethnic minorities in the sci-fi role model and television and film especially not in the UK.
*31:02.980- 31:14.800* :  As soon as I got the opportunity to create a show I was like I want to make this show a majority of black cast and hopefully opens doors that you can see other races in different genres.
*31:15.640- 31:18.820* :  Your manager is Jay Z. What was his feedback?
*31:19.660- 31:30.120* :  Well he saw the first two episodes early on maybe at the end of last year and then I bumped into him in February and he was just like he loved the twist and turns.
*31:30.120- 31:33.860* :  He loved the story telling. He was really supportive man. It was nice.
*31:34.480- 31:36.740* :  Rap Man speaking to my colleague Amal Rajan.
*31:39.660- 31:43.480* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
