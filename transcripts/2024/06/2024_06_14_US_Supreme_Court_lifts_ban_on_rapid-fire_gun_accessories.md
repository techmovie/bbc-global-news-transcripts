*00:00.000- 00:03.060* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.060- 00:08.520* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Saturday 15th of June.
*00:08.520- 00:09.960* :  These are our main stories.
*00:10.640- 00:14.200* :  The US Supreme Court lifts Donald Trump's ban on bump stocks.
*00:14.200- 00:17.780* :  A gun accessory used in America's deadliest mass shooting.
*00:18.520- 00:23.700* :  Western leaders at the G7 Summit reject Russia's proposal for a ceasefire based on Ukraine
*00:24.140- 00:26.300* :  surrendering four regions in the East.
*00:26.900- 00:33.580* :  And Barclay suspends its sponsorship of UK music festivals after bands start to boycott them over their links to Israel.
*00:36.060- 00:40.320* :  Also in this podcast, it can keep their mouths moving for as long as it's needed.
*00:40.660- 00:43.160* :  Always jiggle responsibly is the key messaging.
*00:43.440- 00:51.360* :  The popularity of mouse jigglers and how one firm is cracking down on workers using them and why grey whales are shrinking.
*00:55.480- 00:58.420* :  It's been a setback for Americans calling for more gun control.
*00:58.920- 01:06.880* :  The US Supreme Court has struck down a ban on a gun accessory called a bump stock that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire more quickly.
*01:07.320- 01:08.300* :  Six bullets a second.
*01:08.840- 01:13.220* :  They were banned by Donald Trump after one of the most deadly shootings in US history.
*01:13.600- 01:15.840* :  But the court ruled it was unconstitutional.
*01:16.380- 01:19.980* :  My colleague Paul Moss spoke to our correspondent in Washington, Nomiya Igbar.
*01:20.400- 01:28.120* :  This ban on bump stocks was actually enacted back in 2018 and that was a year after 60 people were killed as a Las Vegas music festival.
*01:28.120- 01:32.240* :  It was one of the deadliest mass shootings in US modern history.
*01:32.240- 01:39.520* :  More than 800 were injured and the gunmen in that incident used a bump stock to fire more than a thousand rounds of ammunition.
*01:39.780- 01:41.200* :  And so this was a policy.
*01:41.200- 01:43.940* :  This was a decision that was brought in by the Trump administration.
*01:44.140- 01:49.460* :  It was actually a major decision in recent years to address the nation's gun violence problem.
*01:49.460- 01:56.400* :  It is worth adding that this ruling does not mean that they will suddenly be readily available nationwide.
*01:56.540- 02:00.340* :  There are up to 18 states that have already banned them.
*02:01.200- 02:10.100* :  I think a lot of people listening will be surprised at the idea that a court would rule it was okay for people to own something which is effectively like a machine gun.
*02:10.100- 02:14.100* :  What were the arguments used in court to say it was a good idea?
*02:15.140- 02:17.220* :  Well, it was actually split down ideological line.
*02:17.220- 02:26.280* :  So it was a vote of six to three and the conservative majority found that basically Donald Trump's administration exceeded its power with the ban.
*02:26.280- 02:28.880* :  They interpreted a decades old law.
*02:28.880- 02:35.480* :  They said that a firearm with this accessory did not meet the definition of a machine gun under federal law.
*02:35.960- 02:43.700* :  And just to quote you, just as Clarence Thomas who wrote the opinion, he said nothing changes when a semi-automatic rifle is equipped with a bump stock.
*02:43.700- 02:46.360* :  The firing cycle remains the same.
*02:46.360- 02:53.840* :  He said all that a bump stock merely does is reduce the amount of time that elapses between separate functions of the trigger.
*02:54.520- 02:58.940* :  That was totally rejected by the liberal justices and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who's one of them.
*02:58.940- 03:02.740* :  She wrote a dissenting opinion which she read from the bench, which is pretty rare.
*03:02.740- 03:11.800* :  And she said just to quote her the court puts bump stocks back in civilian hands and that this majority opinion would have deadly consequences.
*03:11.860- 03:20.060* :  And in reference to this idea that bump stocks don't turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns, she said to quote,
*03:20.060- 03:26.200* :  when I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.
*03:26.880- 03:33.220* :  I know that there is an ongoing for many decades battle legally over gun control in the United States.
*03:33.640- 03:35.520* :  Is this result part of a trend?
*03:35.520- 03:39.160* :  I mean, are we seeing a loosening of the laws around gun control in general?
*03:39.880- 03:47.920* :  Gun policies and plans to try and tighten up gun laws have been stalling in Congress for some time now.
*03:47.920- 03:54.460* :  What was interesting with this ruling is that Donald Trump welcomed it, which would be considered odd considering it was his policy,
*03:54.460- 04:00.720* :  but he is in presidential campaign mode being pro-second amendment rights and pro-gun rights as a very Republican position.
*04:00.900- 04:05.220* :  Present Biden's also in campaign mode, he really came out and criticized this ruling,
*04:05.220- 04:09.820* :  saying that to quote him, weapons of war have no place on American streets.
*04:09.820- 04:11.340* :  He lashed out at Donald Trump.
*04:11.780- 04:16.520* :  He said that he and his Supreme Court nominees in reference to the fact that three justices on the bench,
*04:16.520- 04:20.760* :  appointed by the former president, do not care about the American people.
*04:20.760- 04:26.660* :  I mean, politically, present Biden wants to push for more strict gun laws.
*04:27.000- 04:34.140* :  He wants a salt style or military-grade weapons and munitions and screening process expanded for
*04:34.140- 04:35.420* :  who can and cannot have a gun.
*04:35.420- 04:37.160* :  He just wants it to get stricter.
*04:37.700- 04:39.220* :  Nomid Iqbal in Washington.
*04:39.820- 04:46.040* :  At the G7 summit in Italy, the official agenda was dominated by migration and China's trade policies,
*04:46.040- 04:51.740* :  but there's been much talk about a speech by President Putin that he called an immediate cease-firing Ukraine
*04:51.740- 04:53.620* :  if certain conditions were met.
*04:54.100- 04:59.240* :  They were that Ukraine would give up four regions in the east, partially occupied by Russia now,
*04:59.240- 05:01.660* :  and abandoned ambitions to join NATO.
*05:01.700- 05:05.640* :  Western leaders dismissed the offer as a demand for Ukraine to capitulate,
*05:05.640- 05:09.160* :  with key of calling the proposals offensive to common sense.
*05:09.640- 05:13.680* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landel reports from the summit in southern Italy.
*05:14.280- 05:17.760* :  The war between Russia and Ukraine is being fought on three fronts.
*05:17.760- 05:22.020* :  The fighting on the ground, the industrial race to manufacture ammunition,
*05:22.060- 05:24.840* :  and the diplomatic battle for global opinion.
*05:25.700- 05:30.720* :  And it's this latter contest that's being played out between G7 leaders and Vladimir Putin.
*05:31.320- 05:35.680* :  The G7 are agreeing military pacts with Ukraine, promising more air defenses
*05:36.220- 05:39.540* :  using frozen Russian assets to loan key of $50 billion.
*05:40.580- 05:44.220* :  Their message is the West is united and unflagging in its support.
*05:45.140- 05:49.040* :  President Putin's response is to offer a cease-fire and peace talks.
*05:49.440- 05:52.940* :  Just so long as Ukraine gives up four huge regions in the east,
*05:53.260- 05:55.620* :  Donetsk, Herzoghn, Luhansk and Zaporigia,
*05:56.240- 05:58.700* :  and abandons its ambitions to join NATO.
*05:59.120- 06:06.760* :  Today we're making a concrete real peace proposal,
*06:06.760- 06:08.840* :  Mr. Putin told Russian diplomats.
*06:09.220- 06:12.280* :  If Kiev and Western capitals rejected it in the same way as before,
*06:12.280- 06:17.420* :  then they take political and moral responsibility for continuing the bloodshed.
*06:18.200- 06:20.720* :  Kiev did indeed swiftly reject the proposal.
*06:21.020- 06:24.200* :  President Zelensky said it was the kind of ultimatum Hitler made
*06:24.200- 06:25.580* :  and could not be trusted.
*06:26.200- 06:30.000* :  Some analysts said Mr. Putin was trying to preempt a conference in Switzerland
*06:30.000- 06:34.960* :  this weekend where 90 world leaders will discuss Ukraine's own ideas for peace.
*06:35.760- 06:40.580* :  Others said Russia's leader was trying to divide the West and appeal to the global south,
*06:40.980- 06:44.900* :  playing the peacemaker to encourage countries to push for an end to the war.
*06:45.520- 06:50.700* :  But the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Mr. Putin was in no position to dictate peace terms.
*06:51.240- 06:54.900* :  A NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Mr. Putin's proposal
*06:55.260- 06:58.340* :  was not for peace, but more regression and occupation.
*06:59.300- 07:03.520* :  Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
*07:04.300- 07:07.660* :  but Oleksandr Matvichuk, the founder of the Center of Civil Liberties,
*07:07.940- 07:10.940* :  has been monitoring the way Russia uses information and disinformation
*07:10.940- 07:14.120* :  and anti-Ukrainian messages for many years.
*07:14.760- 07:19.320* :  Beeta Sharma reports now on how disinformation is a big part of the war in Ukraine.
*07:20.100- 07:29.580* :  Russians came to kill us, so it has a very direct impact for several years before large-scale war.
*07:30.460- 07:35.780* :  Russia uses information like a weapon of mass destruction.
*07:36.680- 07:39.740* :  Oleksandr stayed in her home city of Kiev throughout the war,
*07:40.040- 07:44.600* :  documenting evidence of alleged war crimes committed in her country since 2014.
*07:45.700- 07:49.520* :  One of the worst of these happened in Butcher, a suburb of the capital Kiev,
*07:49.520- 07:55.280* :  occupied by Russian troops in March 2022. More than 400 people were killed there.
*07:55.860- 08:00.580* :  Evidence came from on-the-ground reporters and was also verified using satellite imagery.
*08:01.500- 08:03.900* :  Yet the facts were disputed by Russia.
*08:04.420- 08:09.160* :  What happened in Butcher is exactly a false flag attack by the Kiev regime and its western
*08:09.160- 08:15.560* :  sponsors. The possible goal of this provocation is horrifying and brings back the nightmares
*08:15.560- 08:18.500* :  of the Nazi crimes during the Second World War.
*08:19.780- 08:25.740* :  That was Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia, claiming that the images coming from Butcher were faint.
*08:25.740- 08:29.200* :  It's part of the Russian narrative to justify its aggression.
*08:29.880- 08:36.320* :  The message, Ukraine is a hostile neighbor, armed by the West and guided by fascist ideology.
*08:37.000- 08:41.820* :  Anastasia Romaniuk is just one of Ukraine's army of young fact-checkers.
*08:42.240- 08:48.120* :  The funny thing was that they very quickly released several contradictory versions of what happened
*08:48.120- 08:54.700* :  in Butcher and in the same time they were trying to push first the narrative that the Ukrainian
*08:54.700- 09:00.280* :  army killed those people and simultaneously they were trying to push the narrative that this
*09:00.280- 09:06.760* :  massacre never happened. Olga Robinson works with BBC Verify, the BBC's fact-checking service
*09:07.340- 09:11.620* :  and has been monitoring the Russian disinformation ecosystem throughout the conflict in Ukraine.
*09:12.620- 09:19.140* :  It was quite easy to debunk that narrative because we were able to use satellite imagery
*09:19.140- 09:25.080* :  from the area to then compare where the bodies were lying and we were able to establish
*09:25.460- 09:33.740* :  fairly quickly that the bodies were actually visible literally from space way before the Russian
*09:33.740- 09:41.820* :  troops withdrew. The whole narrative fell apart. They tried to tap into existing frustrations,
*09:41.820- 09:48.920* :  existing kind of negative attitudes towards say Western countries or former colonial powers
*09:49.440- 09:55.960* :  and essentially feed into already some of the notions that exist in the society and kind of
*09:55.960- 09:59.660* :  try to amplify them further. But I think also what is important to understand about Russian
*09:59.660- 10:06.200* :  disinformation in particular is that sometimes what they're trying to do is to confuse you as a reader
*10:06.700- 10:12.120* :  to make you doubt everything, to make you doubt the very concept of truth whether it actually exists
*10:12.120- 10:18.180* :  or not. Supporting Ukraine's war efforts with weapons and money has become hugely divisive
*10:18.960- 10:24.720* :  and it's something that Russia is exploiting. Lisa Kaplan is the founder and CEO of Alitia,
*10:24.960- 10:29.860* :  an American technology company helping organizations protect themselves from disinformation
*10:29.860- 10:35.900* :  and social media manipulation. The way that we see it playing out in the United States is that
*10:36.520- 10:42.240* :  the Russian government which used to try to soak chaos by amplifying narratives on both sides
*10:42.240- 10:50.280* :  of the political spectrum is now laser focused on amplifying narratives and supporting candidates
*10:50.800- 10:56.640* :  that advocate for protectionist more isolationist policies while denigrating candidates including
*10:56.640- 11:01.540* :  the current Biden administration in the United States for wanting to support Ukraine.
*11:02.140- 11:07.860* :  And for our Nobel laureate, Alexandra Madvichuk, what advice would she give to those who feel
*11:07.860- 11:15.860* :  overloaded and overwhelmed by information? Probably I will say that truth exists and sometimes
*11:15.860- 11:25.080* :  it's very important to go deeper and to use the simple criteria to analyze the source,
*11:25.240- 11:35.180* :  to analyze the experts who tell some things not to be manipulated by people with money or people
*11:35.180- 11:43.080* :  with informational resources who try to use sub-evalent ability for zane own goals.
*11:44.140- 11:49.320* :  That was the human rights defender, Alexandra Madvichuk, to hear other Nobel prize laureates
*11:49.820- 11:54.200* :  explaining how disinformation is undermining their work. Search for BBC documentary,
*11:54.200- 12:00.920* :  Who's Truth, wherever you get your BBC podcasts. South Africa's parliament has reelected
*12:00.920- 12:10.180* :  Sura Ramaposa as president after a landmark coalition deal. Honorable MC Ramaposa, 283 votes.
*12:12.520- 12:18.040* :  I accordingly declare Honorable MC Ramaposa,
*12:19.100- 12:27.360* :  Julie Elected President, Ramaposa. The sound of parliamentarians celebrating his re-election after
*12:27.360- 12:32.040* :  a period of political drama. The country is now set to have a government of national unity
*12:32.040- 12:37.160* :  with a deal between the African National Congress and the Democratic Alliance. This comes after
*12:37.160- 12:43.420* :  the ANC lost its overall majority for the first time in 30 years. Africa correspondent Barbara
*12:43.420- 12:48.900* :  Petascha is in Cape Town. Sura Ramaposa played a key role in the negotiations that brought
*12:48.900- 12:54.740* :  an end to apartheid 30 years ago. He will now steer South Africa through a seismic shift in its
*12:54.740- 13:00.800* :  politics. He won his second term backed by the ANC's longtime opponent, the Democratic Alliance.
*13:01.660- 13:06.060* :  Shortly before the vote, they agreed on a power-sharing arrangement that also brings in other
*13:06.060- 13:11.340* :  smaller parties. The Democratic Alliance has a reputation for representing the interests of the
*13:11.340- 13:17.320* :  white minority, which it denies. Its free market agenda also clashes with the ANC's social
*13:17.320- 13:22.880* :  welfare policies. But ANC leaders said this arrangement was the best one to ensure stability.
*13:23.980- 13:28.940* :  The next step is for Mr. Ramaposa to allocate cabinet positions, which will include members
*13:28.940- 13:35.180* :  of the Democratic Alliance. The multi-party deal does not include two ANC breakaway parties,
*13:35.180- 13:40.620* :  and they will probably benefit if it fails to deliver economic improvements demanded by voters.
*13:41.560- 13:47.220* :  But polls show many South Africans want this unprecedented grand coalition to succeed.
*13:48.240- 13:52.920* :  We turn to China now, or a prominent women's rights activist, who's reported on the MeToo
*13:52.920- 13:57.240* :  movement, has been handed a five-year prison sentence for subversion.
*13:57.780- 14:01.640* :  Creeper Pat, he found out more from our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton.
*14:02.240- 14:09.020* :  But this woman, Sophia Huang, or Huang Sietin, is known in Chinese. She was a journalist.
*14:09.020- 14:16.900* :  She first became interested in the issue of sexual harassment and sexual abuse back in 2016,
*14:16.900- 14:21.560* :  when she was a young journalist. And she came across a case at her alma mater,
*14:21.560- 14:27.200* :  her university that she had once attended, where a student had accused a professor of sexual harassment.
*14:27.200- 14:33.780* :  And the conversation online about that case all blamed the student. What was she wearing?
*14:33.780- 14:40.380* :  What had she done to provoke the professor? And this infuriated Sophia Huang. And she started
*14:40.380- 14:45.540* :  talking to her friends, fellow journalists, about the issue. She then discovered that they, too,
*14:45.540- 14:50.420* :  had suffered a lot of sexual harassment. And so she became writing about this issue.
*14:50.420- 14:56.740* :  She conducted a massive survey across China of female journalists working in newsrooms across China.
*14:57.100- 15:02.560* :  And she uncovered that more than 80 percent of women working in Chinese newsrooms at Chinese
*15:02.560- 15:08.360* :  news organizations had suffered sexual harassment. And so this is what really got her involved in
*15:08.360- 15:12.680* :  the issue. But it is something that the Chinese authorities did not want her to continually speak
*15:12.680- 15:19.140* :  out about. And they have alleged that she is undermined China. How has that been received?
*15:20.680- 15:25.680* :  Well, China doesn't have a lot of abilities for freedom of expression. So we haven't had a lot of
*15:25.680- 15:31.480* :  reaction to this. So though within the small community, the activist community that she's been
*15:31.480- 15:37.220* :  involved in, there's been a lot of dismay, you know, after Sophia Huang and her friend, we should
*15:37.220- 15:43.380* :  say, was also tried. Wang Jianbing, he was a worker's rights activist. He was tried alongside her.
*15:43.780- 15:49.020* :  You know, after the two were detained back in 2021, 70 of their friends were interrogated by
*15:49.020- 15:54.380* :  police. Many were told to leave the city where they were all living. And that really seems to be
*15:54.820- 15:59.860* :  the issue that those two were getting together with groups of their friends. And we're all talking
*15:59.860- 16:05.520* :  about ways that they could improve Chinese society. And it happened outside of the Communist Party.
*16:05.520- 16:09.500* :  And that's why I think that those two were targeted alongside their friends.
*16:09.700- 16:12.860* :  Where does this leave the white and meaty movement in China?
*16:13.580- 16:18.520* :  Well, the meaty movement is really struggling in China. I mean, the Chinese authorities have never
*16:18.520- 16:25.340* :  really encouraged it. Sophia Huang is not the first Chinese feminist who has been detained,
*16:25.340- 16:30.960* :  who has faced prison time. You know, the Chinese authorities, we have to note that at the very
*16:30.960- 16:36.780* :  top of the Chinese Communist Party, there are no women. And the men at the top of the party have
*16:36.780- 16:43.860* :  long maintained their ability to say what happens in Chinese women's lives, whether they have
*16:43.860- 16:48.400* :  children, how many children they have. And so even though they're loosening those policies,
*16:48.400- 16:53.160* :  they're not stepping out of women's lives. And so that's why the meaty movement,
*16:54.160- 16:59.680* :  the feminist movement, even speaking out against domestic violence, really has not had a lot
*16:59.680- 17:04.900* :  of space within the party. And since the party wants to take up all the space for conversation
*17:04.900- 17:09.280* :  and action within China, it's very, very difficult for Chinese feminists to move forward.
*17:09.740- 17:12.000* :  Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton.
*17:14.180- 17:17.560* :  Coming up on the global news podcast, if I have the chance of
*17:18.360- 17:25.660* :  make the Pope laugh, why won't I go? It was my most important gig. I performed for a spot in heaven.
*17:26.260- 17:28.980* :  How many comedians does it take to make the Pope laugh?
*17:36.620- 17:40.580* :  The fall out of the conflict in the Middle East is being felt in unexpected places,
*17:40.580- 17:44.600* :  music festivals, being the latest battleground. Here in the UK,
*17:44.600- 17:50.060* :  Barclays has suspended sponsorship of all live nation festivals this year, including download,
*17:50.060- 17:55.540* :  latitude and the Isle of White, after protests from bans and fans over the bank providing
*17:55.540- 18:01.380* :  financial services to defend companies supplying Israel. Will Chalk is at the download festival
*18:01.380- 18:06.800* :  and told me more about the background of their decision. Starting earlier this week, we had bans
*18:06.800- 18:11.840* :  from the US, the UK and Australia pulling out of the festival saying they disagreed with its
*18:11.840- 18:17.200* :  ties with Barclays Bank. However, they were with no disrespect intended to them on some of
*18:17.200- 18:22.440* :  those smaller stages, and it's only in the last 24 hours we've had a main stage at Enter
*18:22.440- 18:30.460* :  Shikari, they're playing prime time tomorrow on the main stage. They tweeted and put out on their
*18:30.460- 18:34.460* :  Instagram that they were also in discussions with the festival about what they were going to do,
*18:34.700- 18:39.780* :  and I think this made it a lot harder for download and barclay card to kind of sweep this under
*18:39.780- 18:44.800* :  the rug and ignore it. They have to do something. So it's only in the last few hours we've had
*18:44.800- 18:49.340* :  this announcement from Barclays, and Ralph Reynolds, he's the lead singer from Enter Shikari,
*18:49.340- 18:55.120* :  who I mentioned earlier. He has just in fact sent me this voice note. We've been considering our
*18:55.120- 18:59.780* :  options on this for a while. We've spoken to download and expressed our objection. Barclays
*18:59.780- 19:04.460* :  involvement in the festival, given their ties to Israeli weapons manufacturers. Barclays needs
*19:04.460- 19:09.900* :  to divest immediately. So it was obvious for us, you know, and tell that happens. Barclays
*19:09.900- 19:15.020* :  has no place at any UK music festival. So from Barclays point of view, are they just saying
*19:15.020- 19:20.660* :  we don't want to ruin the festival while risking more bands pulling out? Yeah, from their perspective,
*19:20.700- 19:25.220* :  they say they have been pressured into doing something that they simply don't want to do.
*19:25.860- 19:31.220* :  They talk about the protesters having an agenda for Barclays to debank defense companies,
*19:31.220- 19:35.820* :  which they say is something they remain committed to supporting the defense sector.
*19:36.240- 19:40.120* :  They say it's an important part of keeping this country, the UK and our allies safe.
*19:40.120- 19:44.300* :  They've accused people who support this campaign of intimidating their staff,
*19:44.300- 19:50.120* :  vandalising their branches and online harassment. They conclude saying the only thing this small
*19:50.120- 19:54.360* :  group of activists will achieve is to weaken essential support for cultural events
*19:54.360- 20:00.780* :  enjoyed by millions. And on the ground, do fans know this has happened? Is anyone bothered about it?
*20:01.460- 20:05.620* :  So I've been really surprised by this. You know, people come to festivals by and large to
*20:05.620- 20:10.140* :  forget about the world outside and to have a good time. But I popped out into the crowd earlier,
*20:10.140- 20:15.060* :  and everyone I spoke to and said, oh, I'm from the BBC. I'd like to talk to you about the Barclays.
*20:15.080- 20:19.020* :  They everyone knew what I was talking about, and they all had an opinion too.
*20:19.360- 20:23.700* :  We shouldn't be supporting genocide, basically. Until they start dropping out, I didn't know
*20:23.700- 20:27.760* :  of Barclay cards kind of involvement in it. So it's good they have brought to kind of everyone's
*20:27.760- 20:32.560* :  attention what they're doing. So I spoke, it does work by dropping out a big pressure on them that
*20:33.620- 20:38.120* :  so from the punters perspectives, then this is kind of good to go for the rest of the weekend.
*20:38.120- 20:42.980* :  They know they're going to see all of the bands that they have paid their money to see other than
*20:42.980- 20:49.020* :  the few who dropped out earlier in the week. But it's clear that this dispute between Barclays and
*20:49.020- 20:54.200* :  sections of the music industry, well, this is clearly far from over. Well, chalk reporting.
*20:54.880- 20:59.880* :  Pope Francis has hosted more than 100 comedians from around the world telling them that in difficult
*20:59.880- 21:05.520* :  times they have the power to spread peace and smiles. Some commentators have said this meeting
*21:05.520- 21:11.360* :  is partly an attempt to repair the Pope's image after he used a homophobic slur two weeks ago
*21:11.660- 21:16.300* :  for which the Vatican has apologised. Our religion editor, Ali Mukbal, has more.
*21:17.100- 21:23.580* :  It's okay to laugh at God in the same way we joke about the people we love. So said Pope Francis
*21:23.580- 21:28.760* :  today at the Vatican. He was speaking to an audience of more than 100 comedians from around the
*21:28.760- 21:34.700* :  world that included the co-creator of the office, Stephen Merchant, Father Ted's, Ardelo Hanlon
*21:34.700- 21:40.420* :  and Patrick Kielty. It's part of an attempt to engage with prominent names in contemporary culture
*21:40.840- 21:49.720* :  and included a tribute to the comics. When you manage to make smiles gush from the lips of even one
*21:49.720- 21:56.820* :  spectators at the Pope, you make even God smile amid so much gloomy news immersed as we are in so
*21:56.820- 22:06.640* :  many tragedies. You have the power to spread serenity and smiles. After the speech all the comedians
*22:06.640- 22:12.800* :  including Wuppie Goldberg whose character insists to write disguised herself as a nun lined up
*22:12.820- 22:18.680* :  for a brief handshake and greeting. It's very fast and really loving and maybe happy.
*22:20.400- 22:25.200* :  Given his recent missteps, it was probably just as well the Pope did all the talking today.
*22:25.560- 22:30.380* :  The likes of Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and Chris Rock might have had something to say about
*22:30.380- 22:36.600* :  the fact he's now reported on two separate occasions behind closed doors to have used homophobic
*22:36.600- 22:44.160* :  slurs. In his speech today, he did say Sarah, the wife of Abraham, was nosy in the way women were,
*22:44.160- 22:50.520* :  but on the other hand stressed that humor should not offend, humiliate or put down people.
*22:50.520- 22:54.920* :  My colleague Paul Henley spoke to one of the comedians who had an audience with the Pope.
*22:54.920- 23:00.260* :  He's Michael Mittermeier, a mainstream comedy star of German TV and the stand-up circuit.
*23:00.260- 23:07.060* :  He described how he made the Pope laugh. I gave him a soccer jersey from the German team,
*23:07.060- 23:13.740* :  then you won the pink one. There's also the metaphor like pink. He said something against
*23:13.740- 23:22.100* :  gaze and stuff, but on the back of the jersey, I had his name Francisco and the number 10. I told
*23:22.100- 23:27.400* :  him it's a 10 of Maradona. He's Argentinian, so Maradona is like a soccer god to him.
*23:27.760- 23:31.860* :  And then I said to him, yes, not only the 10 from Maradona, it's also the 10 commandments.
*23:31.940- 23:38.120* :  Made him laugh. If this wasn't attempt by the Vatican, by the Pope to repair some of the damage
*23:38.120- 23:44.260* :  done by his allegedly using this homophobic slur recently, do you think it will have helped
*23:44.260- 23:50.060* :  will it have done the trick? I don't know whether humor cannot change political
*23:50.060- 23:55.880* :  attitude. It's always a matter of time. You know, all this stuff about that they cannot deal
*23:55.880- 24:01.340* :  with humankind like with gay people, trans people and this stuff. It takes a lot of time.
*24:01.340- 24:09.120* :  I'm not excusing their slurs and what they say about people out there. But I'm always open for
*24:09.120- 24:16.280* :  let's do a small step. If I have the chance of make the Pope laugh, why won't I go? It was
*24:16.280- 24:24.100* :  was my most important gig I performed for a spot in heaven. Pacific Grey Wales are rapidly
*24:24.100- 24:29.460* :  getting smaller, according to researchers in the US and Scotland who've been looking at data
*24:29.460- 24:36.160* :  and drone measurements. The researchers found the average length of an adult is now 13% less than
*24:36.160- 24:42.080* :  it was in the year 2000, Terriiga reports. Pacific Grey Wales are viewed as what's called
*24:42.080- 24:48.220* :  ecosystem centenials, skinnier than other whales and less tough, they can give warning of
*24:48.220- 24:54.260* :  possible health hazards from the ocean environment. Now it appears that over the last few decades
*24:54.260- 25:01.860* :  they've been shrinking in size. The researchers looked at data and drone images for 130 of the whales
*25:01.860- 25:10.500* :  and measured a reduction of 13% from those born in 2000 to those born in 2020. It means a whale
*25:10.500- 25:16.380* :  14 meters long is at least a meter and a half shorter than it would have been in the past.
*25:17.120- 25:22.660* :  And even more noticeable is that female whales, which are usually larger than the males,
*25:22.660- 25:29.400* :  have shrunk nearly the same size as them. Dr Enrico Pirata led the study.
*25:29.600- 25:35.840* :  Body size in animals is critical for many aspects of their biology and ecology. So it affects
*25:35.840- 25:41.480* :  the physiology, but importantly for females it affects their ability to store energy reserves
*25:41.480- 25:47.300* :  and therefore to reproduce successfully. So that's the most important aspects that we're worried
*25:47.300- 25:52.400* :  about is the ability of females to produce a calf. Over the same period of time in which the
*25:52.400- 25:58.760* :  whales have been downsizing, climate change has disrupted ocean cycles. That's affecting the
*25:58.760- 26:04.380* :  currents that help plankton to grow and plankton is the whale's main source of food.
*26:05.080- 26:10.640* :  The researchers say that disruption from climate change, both to their nutrition and environment,
*26:10.660- 26:17.280* :  is probably the reason Pacific Grey whales are shrinking. In the past, whale hunting meant
*26:17.280- 26:25.220* :  these huge mammals, once vilified as devilfish, came near to extinction. Now they appear to be
*26:25.220- 26:31.400* :  facing a new type of danger altogether. Now from some of the world's largest mammals to some of
*26:31.400- 26:37.280* :  the smallest. You have ever heard of mouse jigglers, not toys for cats, but an ingenious way
*26:37.280- 26:42.320* :  of convincing a computer you're busy working even if you're away from the screen.
*26:42.320- 26:47.280* :  Some employers are using the devices to get around productivity tracking software to pretend
*26:47.280- 26:52.760* :  they're at their desk while working from home, even if they're not. It seems employers are
*26:52.760- 26:58.080* :  whizing up to this. The American bank Wells Fargo has sacked several staff members after claims
*26:58.080- 27:03.920* :  they were using mouse jigglers to try and trick their bosses. How do they work while Carl Howell
*27:03.920- 27:11.700* :  designs and produces them in the UK? My variation is a 3D printed piece of plastic, or recycled
*27:11.700- 27:17.720* :  a lad, and then there's a watch inside with a second hand that stimulates the mouse every minute.
*27:18.000- 27:23.920* :  It's standalone device and you literally just put your normally wired mouse on top of what is
*27:23.920- 27:28.960* :  my device and then all of a sudden position it correctly and you're good to go and carry on
*27:28.960- 27:33.960* :  reading the documentation or go to the restroom. It can keep the mouse moving for as long as it's
*27:33.960- 27:39.520* :  needed. Always jiggle responsibly is the key messaging. There's a lot of horrible buses out there
*27:39.520- 27:45.080* :  and more than you think trying to micromanage everybody's action. There the actual problem in
*27:45.080- 27:48.780* :  the company it's not the work out who's going you know what I've actually done my day's quota.
*27:49.140- 27:54.380* :  So it does need to be a culture change and it's from the buses and it's from. Like it or not
*27:54.780- 27:59.100* :  it's the older people who have been established too long who haven't been paying attention to
*27:59.100- 28:03.780* :  the like the temperature of what's going on in the workplace. Big firms have been getting tougher
*28:03.780- 28:08.900* :  on hybrid workers of late. Here's our North America business correspondent Michelle Flurry.
*28:09.580- 28:14.120* :  With the rise of remote working since the pandemic some large companies have been using
*28:14.500- 28:19.940* :  increasingly sophisticated tools to monitor employees. There is technology that can track key
*28:19.940- 28:25.900* :  strokes and which websites workers have visited. But methods for evading surveillance have also
*28:25.900- 28:32.320* :  evolved. Mouse movers or mouse jigglers are devices that simulate mouse movement to stop a
*28:32.320- 28:38.420* :  computer from going to sleep and make it look like the user is working. Wells Fargo adopted a hybrid
*28:38.420- 28:45.000* :  working model in 2022 with staff permitted to work from home some of the time. It's now sacked
*28:45.000- 28:49.800* :  and number of people employed in its wealth and investment management unit for pretending to be
*28:49.800- 28:56.600* :  at their keyboards. The BBC has confirmed six instances in which staff were dismissed and one case
*28:56.600- 29:02.280* :  in which a person resigned voluntarily after being confronted with the claims. The bank said it
*29:02.280- 29:07.500* :  did not tolerate unethical behaviour. It's not yet clear how the issue was discovered.
*29:08.280- 29:10.840* :  And North America business correspondent Michelle Flurry.
*29:13.220- 29:16.740* :  And that's all from us for now. There will be a new edition of Global News to download later.
