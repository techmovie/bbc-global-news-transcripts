*01:25.420- 01:26.520* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:26.520- 01:29.880* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Monday the 24th of June.
*01:30.060- 01:34.080* :  Gunman Attack Church is a synagogue and a police checkpoint in the Russian Republic of
*01:34.080- 01:34.780* :  Dagestan.
*01:35.300- 01:38.220* :  Several police officers and an orthodox priest were killed.
*01:38.980- 01:43.960* :  Russia blames the US for Ukrainian missile attack on occupied Crimea, which left at least
*01:43.960- 01:45.160* :  four people dead.
*01:46.000- 01:51.420* :  And Saudi Arabia says more than 1,300 pilgrims died during this year's harsh.
*01:54.120- 01:58.340* :  Also in the podcast, French women march against the far right national rally.
*01:58.700- 02:04.700* :  I'm here because I'm a woman and I don't want my rights to be taken from me because some
*02:05.080- 02:08.140* :  far right movements want to take the power in France.
*02:08.900- 02:14.680* :  And we'll once again welcome a new pair of giant pandas to the Smithsonian's national
*02:14.680- 02:18.280* :  zoo and conservation biology institute in Washington, D.C.
*02:21.940- 02:27.060* :  Pandemonium in the US get it sparked by China's offer of two new bears.
*02:31.760- 02:34.940* :  But we begin in the Russian Republic of Dagestan.
*02:41.740- 02:45.840* :  Gunman opening fire on a street in the regional capital Mahatch Kalah.
*02:45.840- 02:50.420* :  It was one of two cities in the mainly Muslim region which came under attack.
*02:51.060- 02:57.400* :  In WN to 125 kilometers south along the Caspian Sea, a synagogue and an orthodox church
*02:57.400- 02:59.000* :  were attacked and set on fire.
*02:59.660- 03:03.320* :  A second orthodox church and a police checkpoint were also targeted.
*03:04.020- 03:08.620* :  As we record this podcast, the authorities say at least ten people were killed, mostly
*03:08.620- 03:11.860* :  police officers, but including a Russian orthodox priest.
*03:12.640- 03:16.600* :  In Mahatch Kalah, people fled in panic from a beach while there were also reports of
*03:16.600- 03:18.940* :  gunman attacking a police car in a village.
*03:19.720- 03:23.860* :  I've got more details about the assault from Pamela Ismailov from the BBC Russian service.
*03:24.460- 03:29.880* :  Well, although we know that the authorities announced that the active phase of counter-terrorist
*03:29.880- 03:35.000* :  operations, as they call it, has now finished, but they still keep the roads leading out
*03:35.000- 03:37.240* :  of Mahatch Kalah completely locked down.
*03:37.240- 03:43.140* :  The cities in lockdown, they are looking for any possible attackers and people who were
*03:43.140- 03:44.160* :  associated with them.
*03:44.700- 03:49.180* :  But we definitely know that six attackers had been killed, four in Mahatch Kalah, two in
*03:49.180- 03:55.380* :  their tent, and we know that at least ten people are dead, a date of them, police officers
*03:55.660- 03:56.620* :  and 25 injured.
*03:57.360- 04:02.760* :  The shootout at the village that you mentioned, that is probably the reports about the apprehension
*04:02.760- 04:07.960* :  of a local official from that village, someone called Magomed Amarov, apparently, and that
*04:07.960- 04:14.880* :  what the reports say, his two sons and nephew were among the fighters attacking the churches
*04:14.880- 04:15.740* :  and synagogues.
*04:16.000- 04:20.440* :  Yeah, I mean, so these were what coordinated attacks, and do we know who by?
*04:21.160- 04:26.300* :  It sounds like they're absolutely coordinated, they basically started absolutely at the same
*04:26.300- 04:26.680* :  time.
*04:27.260- 04:32.560* :  The question of who is behind it is very difficult one, because we definitely don't
*04:32.560- 04:40.680* :  know who was organizing that attack, however, last October, when Hamas attacked Israel, the
*04:40.680- 04:46.200* :  strange riots happened in Mahatch Kalah International Airport, because somebody spread
*04:46.200- 04:52.240* :  the rumor that apparently Jewish settlers, refugees are coming to Mahatch Kalah and the
*04:52.240- 04:58.500* :  riots have started and men of, you know, sort of fighting age men have taken over the
*04:58.500- 05:02.900* :  building of the airport, even the airfield, and police was unable to do anything.
*05:03.520- 05:09.640* :  So the fact that there is an undercurrent that we don't know exactly, you know, the Islamist
*05:09.640- 05:14.420* :  kind of undercurrent that we don't know exactly how it operates, where it comes from, probably
*05:14.420- 05:15.380* :  still exists there.
*05:15.920- 05:21.080* :  And of course, this region, Dagestan bordering, Chechnya has a history of violence.
*05:21.080- 05:24.220* :  Will it be worrying the authorities in Moscow?
*05:25.280- 05:31.400* :  Absolutely, because what happened in the 90s when Chechen was spread violence from Chechnya
*05:31.400- 05:35.280* :  to Dagestan as well, it was the clash of two kinds of Islam.
*05:35.300- 05:41.400* :  Dagestan is a conservative Muslim country, that's correct, but the Islam practice there is
*05:41.800- 05:45.340* :  Sufi Islam, much more peaceful and more meditative.
*05:45.800- 05:52.720* :  The Islam practice in Chechnya was and is the Habib Islam, so much more radical.
*05:53.160- 05:58.620* :  So we can see that there's a possible clash within Dagestan itself that could also spread
*05:58.620- 06:03.320* :  over into other Islamic republics of Northern Caucasus, and that's definitely should be
*06:03.320- 06:04.360* :  worrying authorities in Moscow.
*06:04.880- 06:07.620* :  Family smile of the BBC Russian service.
*06:08.180- 06:13.860* :  Meanwhile, Russia says the United States is responsible for a Ukrainian attack on occupied
*06:13.860- 06:17.500* :  Crimea, which killed at least four people, including three children.
*06:18.020- 06:22.760* :  The Russian Defence Ministry said the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, which Moscow annexed
*06:22.760- 06:28.860* :  in 2014, was targeted by U.S. supplied attackums missiles, one of which exploded above
*06:28.860- 06:29.360* :  a beach.
*06:29.540- 06:34.540* :  Julian Marshall got the details from our security correspondent Gordon Carrera in Kiev.
*06:35.040- 06:41.300* :  What we know comes from Russian officials who have said that a number of these attackums
*06:41.620- 06:48.380* :  missiles were fired, and four were intercepted by their air defenses, but they say one of
*06:48.380- 06:56.580* :  the fifth detonated mid-air and then rain down, they say, on a beach at Sevastopol, leading
*06:56.580- 06:59.080* :  to over a hundred wounded, they say, in the number dead.
*06:59.420- 07:03.280* :  Not likely to have been the attended target, more likely a military target, a base perhaps
*07:03.280- 07:03.780* :  nearby.
*07:03.860- 07:10.940* :  And this is the first time that Ukraine has used these attackum missiles on Crimea.
*07:10.940- 07:15.980* :  Now, what's I think significant is these are an important tool in their armory, as they
*07:15.980- 07:19.960* :  see it, because they have the ability to go much longer-range than some of the other
*07:19.960- 07:25.340* :  weapon systems, up to 300 kilometers, which from the Ukrainian point of view allows them
*07:25.340- 07:31.580* :  to hit deeper behind Russian lines, in particularly supply lines, bases, and Crimea has been one
*07:31.580- 07:32.280* :  of the targets.
*07:32.800- 07:38.460* :  I think what's significant is the Russians are blaming the U.S., saying that it was U.S.
*07:38.460- 07:44.840* :  Specialists who programmed the coordinates for these missiles using U.S. satellite data,
*07:45.280- 07:50.320* :  as well as the weapons themselves having been U.S. supplied, and then saying from the Russian
*07:50.320- 07:53.980* :  foreign ministry that they will be raising this in the international community.
*07:53.980- 08:01.160* :  Could I just turn to Harkiv, a city in northeast Ukraine, which has come under Russian attack
*08:01.160- 08:02.660* :  for the second day in a row?
*08:03.100- 08:08.200* :  Yes, that's right, another attack from Russian glide bombs on Harkiv, yesterday those
*08:08.200- 08:12.540* :  glide bombs hit some manufacturing facilities and a residential building, killing a woman
*08:12.540- 08:13.740* :  who just got off a trolley bus.
*08:14.080- 08:18.900* :  Today it looks like an educational building was hit with more casualties.
*08:18.900- 08:26.480* :  So a part of what seems to be a sustained campaign against that city, which is close to where
*08:26.480- 08:31.420* :  the Russians have been trying to push down in the last month or so militarily.
*08:31.420- 08:36.920* :  So it looks like part of that wider offensive is to try and put pressure on the city and
*08:36.920- 08:42.480* :  more broadly we've seen the Russian aerial attacks targeting civilian infrastructure, particularly
*08:42.480- 08:48.440* :  in terms of the energy infrastructure across Ukraine as well, which has led to the Ukrainians
*08:48.680- 08:49.900* :  calling for more air defenses.
*08:50.360- 08:56.340* :  Haven't the Ukrainians been given permission by the United States to use those U.S. supplied
*08:56.340- 09:03.160* :  long-range missiles to attack inside Russia in the vicinity of Harkiv?
*09:04.060- 09:05.460* :  Has that happened yet?
*09:06.260- 09:14.040* :  The Americans were reluctant to allow those weapons to be used over the border into Russia
*09:14.660- 09:20.940* :  because they were concerned that that could be seen as an escalatory step, but the U.S.
*09:21.300- 09:26.260* :  confirmed recently that it would allow those, particularly I think the concern was that
*09:26.260- 09:31.960* :  around that Harkiv area, because of the Russian advances around a month ago, that there
*09:31.960- 09:36.420* :  was a danger of a kind of serious pushback of Ukrainian defenses.
*09:36.880- 09:40.860* :  The concern was it's quite close to the border there, that to be able to deal with the
*09:40.860- 09:46.280* :  supply lines and the Russian forces building up, that they needed to be able to attack over
*09:46.280- 09:46.660* :  the border.
*09:46.860- 09:49.360* :  So yes, the permission was given by the U.S.
*09:50.000- 09:52.660* :  Gordon Carrera and Kyiv talking to Julian Marshall.
*09:53.360- 09:58.140* :  The Israeli military has admitted that its soldiers violated operating procedures when
*09:58.140- 10:02.940* :  they tied a wounded Palestinian man to a military vehicle during a raid in the occupied
*10:02.940- 10:03.660* :  West Bank.
*10:03.660- 10:09.280* :  Israel said he was a suspect who was wounded in an exchange of fire in Janine, and was
*10:09.280- 10:11.460* :  eventually transferred to the Red Crasent.
*10:12.020- 10:16.600* :  The West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories, has seen an upsurge in violence
*10:16.600- 10:18.260* :  since the war in Gaza began.
*10:18.840- 10:23.200* :  The Israeli Defence Minister, you have gone, is currently visiting the U.S. to discuss
*10:23.200- 10:27.600* :  the conflict with Hamas, as well as tensions with the Lebanese group as Bala.
*10:27.660- 10:32.880* :  I spoke about that to our correspondent in Jerusalem, Sebastian Asher, but first I asked
*10:32.880- 10:36.740* :  him what do people in Israel make of the video showing the man strapped to a jeep?
*10:37.120- 10:40.700* :  To be honest, I haven't seen a huge reaction to it in Israel.
*10:40.700- 10:47.140* :  There's been more reaction to some of the more aggressive behavior by the police in Israel
*10:47.140- 10:52.560* :  itself on Saturday night when they were dealing with the latest anti-government protests
*10:53.220- 10:58.040* :  and demonstrators demanding that the Netanyahu government do all it can to get the remaining
*10:58.040- 10:58.880* :  hostages out.
*10:58.940- 11:00.080* :  There's been a lot about that.
*11:00.580- 11:05.820* :  There's a piece from an Israeli newspaper of the Jerusalem Post that expresses a viewpoint
*11:05.820- 11:11.500* :  that would be shared, I think, by many, essentially saying the UN special rapporteur Francesca
*11:11.500- 11:17.660* :  Albanese accused the idea of using this Palestinian man as a human shield.
*11:18.220- 11:22.440* :  Now the reaction in the Jerusalem Post and its editorial is to say that this is completely
*11:23.140- 11:28.740* :  ridiculous and unfair since its Hamas, which uses human shields.
*11:28.740- 11:33.660* :  And as we know, this has been an accusation that the Israeli military, the Israeli government
*11:33.660- 11:37.900* :  has made about Hamas for years and years, but specifically in the context of the current
*11:37.900- 11:43.700* :  conflict in Gaza, where the government officials have said that Hamas essentially is responsible
*11:43.740- 11:50.940* :  for civilian casualties in Gaza as Israel tries to target senior Hamas, commanders and
*11:50.940- 11:58.440* :  fighters by positioning the sites where they are sheltering, hiding out, however you want
*11:58.440- 12:02.980* :  to put it, close to where civilians are, so essentially saying that it's Hamas who
*12:02.980- 12:04.240* :  uses human shields.
*12:04.800- 12:10.900* :  But I mean, again, this is a very, very bad negative image for Israel to go around the
*12:10.900- 12:11.160* :  world.
*12:11.340- 12:12.500* :  This video has gone viral.
*12:13.120- 12:18.100* :  If you take away the accusation that potentially the man was being used as human shield, the
*12:18.100- 12:22.660* :  way that he's described his treatment, his family as well, is pretty extreme.
*12:22.660- 12:27.920* :  I mean, he had been wounded and he says that he was basically waiting for ambulances for
*12:27.920- 12:34.980* :  one to two hours and then was manhandled and thrust up onto this truck and bound to it
*12:35.500- 12:36.520* :  in the heat of the day.
*12:36.520- 12:39.360* :  So he had the metal burning into him as well.
*12:39.880- 12:43.100* :  So he says that the injuries sort of really sustained were made much worse by this.
*12:43.300- 12:47.980* :  And not ideal for these images to be beamed around the world as the Israeli defense minister
*12:48.460- 12:49.240* :  is in Washington?
*12:49.740- 12:49.920* :  Yes.
*12:49.920- 12:51.100* :  I mean, he is there.
*12:51.100- 12:58.700* :  You have Galant to speak to his counterpart, senior US officials about where, not just
*12:58.700- 13:04.840* :  the conflict in Gaza, but potentially a widening and a bigger conflict opening up on Israel's
*13:04.840- 13:07.860* :  northern border with Hasbulla and Lebanon itself, where that might go.
*13:08.220- 13:12.000* :  There's been a lot of rhetoric from both sides in the past week or two, which has really
*13:12.000- 13:17.800* :  raised huge concern that after Gaza, Lebanon may be next in the sights of the Israeli army
*13:17.800- 13:18.520* :  and the Israeli government.
*13:18.980- 13:20.600* :  Sebastian Asher in Jerusalem.
*13:21.440- 13:25.400* :  The government of Saudi Arabia has given the first official death toll for this year's
*13:25.400- 13:29.000* :  hard pilgrimage to Mecca, which took place during an extreme heat wave.
*13:29.520- 13:34.320* :  Pilgrims that register with the authorities can take advantage of facilities like air-conditioned
*13:34.320- 13:39.340* :  tents and official, hard transport, but nearly half a million of the pilgrims were not
*13:39.340- 13:40.540* :  on authorized trips.
*13:41.040- 13:42.280* :  Yusuf Taha has the details.
*13:42.800- 13:48.580* :  The Saudi health minister, Fahd al-Jalajal, said that 1,301 pilgrims had lost their lives,
*13:48.960- 13:51.800* :  with 83 percent of them being unregistered.
*13:52.000- 13:57.000* :  Mr Al-Jalajal said they had walked long distances in searing heat, which at times exceeded 50
*13:57.000- 14:01.880* :  degrees Celsius, with no shelter, while many were elderly with long-term illnesses.
*14:02.400- 14:07.220* :  Saudi Arabia has been criticized for not doing more to make the had safer, especially
*14:07.220- 14:12.220* :  for unregistered pilgrims who have no access to facilities such as air-conditioned tents
*14:12.380- 14:14.020* :  and official, hard transport.
*14:14.580- 14:15.240* :  Yusuf Taha
*14:16.160- 14:20.580* :  Last year, China took back its pandas from the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington,
*14:20.580- 14:27.580* :  DC, leaving the city without any for the first time since 1972, but two more pandas
*14:27.580- 14:30.160* :  are on their way, they should arrive by the end of the year.
*14:30.660- 14:34.200* :  Toby Luckhurst reports from the U.S. Capitol on the Mounting Excitement.
*14:34.920- 14:40.480* :  We'll once again welcome a new pair of giant pandas to the Smithsonian's National Zoo
*14:40.880- 14:43.740* :  in Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, DC.
*14:47.320- 14:52.080* :  The pandas have been at DC's Zoos in 1972, when the Chinese gifted a pair to President
*14:52.080- 14:56.780* :  Richard Nixon's wife Pat, but tensions are high between Washington and Beijing, and DC's
*14:56.780- 14:59.640* :  pandas were returned to China in November of 2023.
*15:00.360- 15:04.700* :  The announcement of two new bears came last month in a slick marketing video, featuring
*15:04.700- 15:06.260* :  First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.
*15:06.440- 15:10.960* :  We can't wait to celebrate this historic moment here in our nation's Capitol.
*15:11.560- 15:12.200* :  Join us.
*15:12.840- 15:15.780* :  It's official, the pandas are coming back to DC.
*15:23.620- 15:27.440* :  We might be able to hear some building work behind me, where they're preparing for the
*15:27.440- 15:29.720* :  arrival of the new pandas.
*15:30.500- 15:35.800* :  There are pandas all over the place, screaming, the pandas are coming, in big blockletters.
*15:36.140- 15:43.600* :  I've got a line at the end of 2024, and there's already a ton of merchandise in the shops
*15:43.600- 15:43.940* :  here.
*15:44.400- 15:56.380* :  I can see mugs, t-shirts, necklaces, building blogs, magnets, toys, obviously, hoodies,
*15:56.420- 15:59.020* :  I mean, anything you could possibly imagine with a panda on it.
*15:59.300- 16:02.320* :  This looks like very good business for the zoo, I'm sure they can make a lot of money
*16:02.320- 16:05.700* :  through their merchandise, but of course it's very good business for the Chinese.
*16:05.700- 16:10.920* :  The pandas are out on loan, they're not kept forever in the U.S., it's been Sony and
*16:10.920- 16:15.940* :  revealed it will pay $1 million a year to China to fund conservation research efforts
*16:15.940- 16:16.180* :  there.
*16:16.800- 16:21.120* :  So it makes a lot of sense for them to do it, and of course it's not just a money spinner,
*16:21.380- 16:23.060* :  it has diplomacy at work as well.
*16:24.260- 16:25.640* :  Huge soft power in this.
*16:25.760- 16:29.220* :  Children all over the United States love pandas now.
*16:29.440- 16:34.860* :  Dennis Wilder was a senior CIA official, but he now serves as a senior fellow at Georgetown
*16:34.860- 16:36.980* :  University here in the U.S. Capitol.
*16:37.200- 16:42.720* :  The soft power has worked when China looks at how bad its reputation is in the United
*16:42.720- 16:43.140* :  States.
*16:43.340- 16:48.000* :  What it's hoping for is a new generation of Americans who are going to have a different
*16:48.000- 16:48.500* :  attitude.
*16:48.580- 16:53.940* :  Indeed, if you look at the polling numbers, younger Americans have a more positive attitude
*16:53.940- 16:57.440* :  of China than older Americans, and part of it is pandas.
*16:57.600- 17:01.720* :  Mr. Wilder told me that although relations between DC and Beijing have sunk even lower
*17:01.720- 17:06.160* :  of issues like the Russian invasion of Ukraine or claims in the South China Sea, neither
*17:06.160- 17:08.420* :  power sees a reason to make things worse this year.
*17:08.660- 17:13.240* :  Right now there is what I would call uncomfortable coexistence.
*17:13.580- 17:16.400* :  We are barely stable in the relationship right now.
*17:16.980- 17:21.160* :  But both sides have reason not to have it blow up in 2024.
*17:21.900- 17:24.740* :  Dennis Wilder ending that report by Toby Luckhurst.
*17:27.360- 17:29.220* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:29.860- 17:30.560* :  Yeah, what in?
*17:30.560- 17:32.060* :  And first thing was the smell.
*17:32.060- 17:33.640* :  It's smell everything.
*17:34.420- 17:37.120* :  All the weed, all those human stuff.
*17:37.900- 17:41.840* :  The man whose family home was turned into a cannabis farm.
*17:51.240- 17:51.960* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*17:51.960- 17:56.680* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*17:56.680- 17:58.040* :  prices due to inflation.
*17:58.460- 17:59.040* :  They said yes.
*17:59.060- 18:03.460* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those honorists to your contracts,
*18:03.460- 18:05.820* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*18:05.840- 18:07.420* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*18:07.700- 18:12.380* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15

*18:56.680- 19:02.080* :  There has been widespread anger on Indian social media after a crucial entrance test for
*19:02.080- 19:05.700* :  postgraduate medical courses was postponed with just hours to go.
*19:06.300- 19:10.780* :  The health ministry called it a precautionary measure after allegations of irregularities
*19:10.780- 19:13.180* :  in cheating in other entrance tests.
*19:13.720- 19:19.580* :  And Barassan Eti Rajan reports, more than 200,000 doctors had been registered to appear
*19:19.580- 19:23.740* :  for Sunday's neat PG exam nearly half of them women.
*19:24.260- 19:29.580* :  One doctor on social media said she had travelled all the way from Dubai to take the exam
*19:29.580- 19:33.400* :  and had spent more than a thousand dollars to prepare for the test.
*19:33.840- 19:37.420* :  Another candidate said, I can't put my anger into words.
*19:37.740- 19:40.600* :  Does the government know how frustrating this is?
*19:41.200- 19:46.500* :  The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing severe criticism over the alleged
*19:46.500- 19:51.080* :  lack of oversight and integrity in the handling of crucial entrance exams.
*19:51.680- 19:56.840* :  On Saturday night, it sacked the head of the National Testing Agency after allegations
*19:56.840- 20:00.780* :  of irregularities in the undergraduate medical entrance exam.
*20:01.380- 20:05.840* :  Opposition parties and student groups have been holding protests across the country.
*20:05.840- 20:09.260* :  Our South Asia regional editor, Anne Barassan Eti Rajan.
*20:10.140- 20:14.900* :  If the polls are to be believed, France could see a seismic victory for the far right in
*20:14.900- 20:16.660* :  the upcoming parliamentary election.
*20:17.400- 20:21.620* :  On Sunday, thousands of women took to the streets of Paris and other cities to voice their
*20:21.620- 20:24.380* :  opposition to Marine Le Pen's national rally.
*20:24.960- 20:28.640* :  One of those who took part was Shirley Wooden of the French Communist Party.
*20:30.400- 20:34.180* :  We are witnessing a comeback to an archaic order that women can't tolerate.
*20:34.880- 20:39.500* :  And it s also a culture of hate that feminists have always abored, because feminists have
*20:39.500- 20:44.960* :  always developed international solidarity, a culture of peace, which is in total contradiction
*20:44.960- 20:46.620* :  with the values of the national rally.
*20:48.420- 20:52.900* :  When the national rally rejects claims that it will erode women s rights and says it s
*20:52.900- 20:57.220* :  actually seen its support among women rise, I heard more about the demonstration from
*20:57.220- 21:01.240* :  Catherine Norris Trent, a senior correspondent for France 24.
*21:01.700- 21:03.900* :  There were thousands of people protesting.
*21:04.600- 21:06.080* :  These demonstrations were in Paris.
*21:06.520- 21:12.020* :  They were in other cities across France, too, and they had been called for by feminist organizations
*21:12.020- 21:18.700* :  more than 200 had called these protests to warn about what they say are the dangers for
*21:18.700- 21:21.940* :  women under a potential far right government.
*21:21.940- 21:27.060* :  They ve been saying things about the right to get an abortion, traditional views of lots
*21:27.060- 21:30.560* :  of members of the national rally Marine Le Penz party.
*21:30.560- 21:35.900* :  They fear that it could lead to a regression in terms of how women viewed in French society.
*21:36.280- 21:41.720* :  And does the national rally hold these views, does it plan these kind of things if it gets
*21:41.720- 21:42.300* :  into power?
*21:42.360- 21:47.920* :  Well, the potential prime minister for the national rally, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella,
*21:47.920- 21:53.260* :  put out a video, explicitly denying that the national rally would be a threat to women s
*21:53.260- 21:53.600* :  rights.
*21:53.940- 21:59.820* :  He said that by fighting insecurity, which a lot of people take to mean that he's equating
*21:59.820- 22:05.000* :  insecurity with immigration, he says that by cracking down on that they'll make the streets
*22:05.000- 22:06.580* :  of France safer for women.
*22:06.580- 22:12.080* :  But if you look at recent events in Parliament, the right to an abortion was enshrined in the
*22:12.080- 22:18.380* :  French constitution, an only around half of the national rallies MPs actually voted
*22:18.380- 22:19.040* :  for that.
*22:19.160- 22:22.600* :  So some people have pointed to that saying, look, they're saying they're in favor of women's
*22:22.600- 22:22.940* :  rights.
*22:23.220- 22:25.880* :  But when it comes down to it, they're still very conservative.
*22:26.380- 22:31.760* :  And yet, despite that, the national rally seems to be winning over women voters.
*22:32.020- 22:32.440* :  Why is that?
*22:32.560- 22:39.780* :  I think that can be put down to the decline in popularity of other parties in France, including
*22:39.840- 22:44.760* :  Emmanuel Macron's own party and the traditional left and right wing parties, a lot of voters
*22:44.760- 22:50.160* :  in France, men, man, women are very fed up with the traditional parties, saying that they
*22:50.400- 22:53.080* :  think the country's in decline, that there's been no progress.
*22:53.520- 22:58.980* :  So I think that ties into this general discontent and people perhaps hoping that the national
*22:58.980- 23:03.020* :  rally might be some kind of alternative, something they haven't tried yet.
*23:03.400- 23:07.020* :  Now, the protest today is just the latest against the far right.
*23:07.020- 23:10.760* :  How does France feel going into these parliamentary elections?
*23:11.160- 23:16.000* :  Well, France is pretty on edge ahead of the first round of the elections, which are in
*23:16.040- 23:16.960* :  one week's time.
*23:17.380- 23:21.560* :  There's a real sense that we don't know what's going to happen here that are in uncharted
*23:21.560- 23:22.120* :  territory.
*23:22.640- 23:25.760* :  The polling is quite difficult because they're two round elections.
*23:25.760- 23:30.160* :  So only the top candidates get through the first round of voting, and then there could
*23:30.160- 23:34.800* :  be head-to-heads or three-way run-offs or even four-way run-offs in some circumstances.
*23:34.840- 23:38.220* :  So it's not clear what the outcome could be.
*23:38.220- 23:44.040* :  The opinion polls do look like they're pointing towards the national rally being the biggest
*23:44.040- 23:45.600* :  party in the French Parliament.
*23:46.000- 23:47.740* :  Will it have enough to form a government?
*23:48.220- 23:52.000* :  They said they'll only want to do that if they've got an overall majority that can actually
*23:52.000- 23:52.360* :  govern.
*23:52.880- 23:59.020* :  Or the country could be plunged into months of political chaos with no party having a
*23:59.020- 24:02.560* :  majority being that hung parliament and France basically being ungovernable.
*24:02.560- 24:05.200* :  So there's a lot of nervousness in France right now.
*24:05.700- 24:07.920* :  Catherine Norris trend of France 24.
*24:08.760- 24:13.460* :  The Kenyan president, William Ruto, has said he is willing to engage with the young people
*24:13.460- 24:16.020* :  who've been protesting against planned tax rises.
*24:16.580- 24:21.620* :  His overture came a day after a second person died from injuries sustained during Thursday's
*24:21.620- 24:23.620* :  big rally in the capital, Nairobi.
*24:23.820- 24:29.360* :  In his first public comments, Mr. Ruto praised the demonstrators for raising their voices
*24:30.120- 24:30.140* :  peacefully.
*24:30.140- 24:34.940* :  But a protest organizer said he must respond publicly to their demand for him to scrap
*24:34.940- 24:38.620* :  the tax increase and accuse the police of brutalising the protesters.
*24:39.280- 24:41.380* :  So what should we make of the president's intervention?
*24:41.380- 24:45.180* :  I asked our Africa regional editor Richard Cagui in Nairobi.
*24:45.720- 24:51.240* :  It wasn't quite anticipated because there's been lots of anxiety in the air because you
*24:51.240- 24:56.260* :  don't quite really know how this is going to end because the government appeared probably
*24:56.260- 24:57.360* :  because of its silence.
*24:57.360- 24:59.640* :  They're going to just stand their position.
*25:00.280- 25:05.380* :  And so these coming from the president today and striking sort of like a reconciliation
*25:05.440- 25:10.780* :  to tone, it is a breath of fresh air because nobody knew really how this is going to
*25:10.780- 25:15.220* :  pan out come Tuesday when the young protesters had called for a national strike.
*25:15.740- 25:20.060* :  How badly has the government been rattled by the strength of the opposition?
*25:20.560- 25:26.420* :  The government could be shaken to the core because you know, these are protesters.
*25:26.500- 25:27.360* :  They're young.
*25:27.940- 25:34.020* :  They're not organised typically like those protests that are led by trade unionist or politicians.
*25:34.900- 25:39.440* :  So it's a bit difficult, especially for the government to really tell where this is
*25:39.600- 25:41.040* :  coming and where it's headed to.
*25:41.040- 25:46.020* :  So a lot of people would say the government might have been caught off guard when he came
*25:46.020- 25:46.560* :  to this.
*25:47.280- 25:53.060* :  And this olive branch from the president, could it be a prelude to a U-turn on the tax
*25:53.060- 25:55.620* :  rises or is it merely them perhaps playing for time?
*25:56.740- 26:02.400* :  Maybe playing for time because you know, their constitutional timelines as to when the
*26:02.400- 26:04.460* :  finance bill needs to be passed into law.
*26:04.460- 26:09.120* :  So what happened is when we had debate in parliament and that the bill went through its
*26:09.120- 26:10.020* :  second reading.
*26:10.580- 26:15.460* :  So a committee was formed and they're supposed to look into some of the proposed amendments
*26:15.460- 26:21.220* :  and come back to parliament on Tuesday where the bill is going to be debated and are subjected
*26:21.220- 26:22.720* :  to a final vote.
*26:23.280- 26:28.400* :  So I don't know what would be able to be accomplished between Sunday and Tuesday.
*26:28.400- 26:30.360* :  I don't know how this is going to be arranged.
*26:30.360- 26:36.020* :  But a lot of our commentators say if it's rejected, it may not necessarily plan the country
*26:36.020- 26:38.640* :  into a financial or constitutional crisis.
*26:39.140- 26:40.560* :  Richard Kigoye in Nairobi.
*26:41.340- 26:45.980* :  In a surprise move, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is to step back from his duties and handover
*26:45.980- 26:47.980* :  powers to his son in October.
*26:48.220- 26:52.260* :  However, Grand Duke Henri will retain his title, Mr. Pucker, reports.
*26:52.800- 26:57.180* :  When a crown pass is on to a new generation, it normally happens through death or abdication
*26:57.180- 26:59.040* :  but not so in Luxembourg.
*26:59.320- 27:03.020* :  The tiny but rich European country has its own way of doing things.
*27:03.700- 27:08.780* :  There, the Grand Duke appoints a lieutenant-president-on in effect a regent who takes over the duties
*27:08.780- 27:09.800* :  of the head of state.
*27:10.260- 27:14.500* :  Prince Gionn was always expected to get the title, but the timing was a surprise.
*27:14.500- 27:20.300* :  The Grand Duke is only 69 and in good health, despite an angioplasty more than 10 years ago.
*27:20.760- 27:25.200* :  Like his father before him, he's likely to remain the formal head of state for some years
*27:25.600- 27:29.600* :  before handing over the throne and the Grand Duke title to his son.
*27:30.000- 27:30.600* :  Mr. Pucker.
*27:31.460- 27:35.480* :  Renting your home out to strangers can seem like something of a risk.
*27:35.800- 27:38.180* :  How can you be sure they'll look after it while you're away?
*27:38.900- 27:43.400* :  But spare a thought for one home owner in London who returned to find his house transformed
*27:43.400- 27:44.800* :  into a drug farm.
*27:45.280- 27:46.740* :  Sophie Smith takes up the story.
*27:47.180- 27:49.380* :  Yeah, walked in and first thing was the smell.
*27:49.380- 27:51.020* :  It just smelled everything.
*27:51.780- 27:54.480* :  All the weed, all those human stuff.
*27:55.120- 27:58.440* :  When Charles Reeves came home, he couldn't recognize his house.
*27:58.440- 28:03.060* :  There were wires dangling from holes in the ceiling and mounds of soil covering the floor.
*28:03.300- 28:06.240* :  In one room, reaching almost a meter high.
