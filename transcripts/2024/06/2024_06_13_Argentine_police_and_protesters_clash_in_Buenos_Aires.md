*01:20.620- 01:24.200* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.400- 01:31.200* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Thursday the 13th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:31.700- 01:36.260* :  In Argentina, there have been violent clashes between police and protesters as lawmakers
*01:36.260- 01:42.080* :  discuss controversial economic reforms. The top US diplomat, Anthony Blinken, says a
*01:42.080- 01:46.920* :  cease-fire deal on Gaza is still possible, but judges the parties to stop haggly.
*01:47.600- 01:53.020* :  Francis Maiden's centre-right opposition party votes to remove its leader after he proposed
*01:53.020- 02:01.360* :  an alliance with the far-right national rally. Also in this podcast, it's an intact shipwreck,
*02:01.380- 02:08.560* :  it hasn't broken, it's lying upright on its keel, slightly tilted over to ports.
*02:09.260- 02:13.260* :  The ship on which the famous polar explorer, Ernest Shackelton,
*02:13.260- 02:19.100* :  made his final voyage, has been found. And what's life like on a remote island.
*02:24.820- 02:30.120* :  We start with Argentina where protesters have clashed with police in the capital Buenos Aires.
*02:30.120- 02:36.060* :  The violence began as lawmakers discussed the controversial economic reforms planned by President
*02:36.060- 02:40.980* :  Javier Miele, who's promised drastic measures to address the country's dire situation.
*02:41.560- 02:46.400* :  He wants to introduce a state of emergency for the economy, including cutting pensions.
*02:47.000- 02:52.260* :  As we're recording this podcast, more than 40 people have been injured in scenes described
*02:52.260- 02:58.540* :  by local media as a battlefield. Luis Fajardo from BBC Monitoring is following developments
*02:58.540- 03:01.740* :  from Miami and told me about what's been happening.
*03:02.200- 03:06.840* :  There have been very serious disturbances in Buenos Aires around the building of the capital
*03:06.840- 03:12.620* :  according to Argentina media, which of course is giving an extensive coverage of this situation.
*03:13.120- 03:18.780* :  Apparently, one car belonging to a media outlet, to a major media outlet in Argentina was burned.
*03:18.800- 03:23.280* :  And as you mentioned, there have been several injured people. There's a very large presence
*03:23.280- 03:28.240* :  of security forces around the building. At one point, they were afraid that the situation,
*03:28.240- 03:32.000* :  they were getting too close to the congress building, to the capital.
*03:32.520- 03:38.080* :  And the situation continues being very tense, according to Argentina, both in social media and
*03:38.080- 03:40.320* :  all kinds of media, which are following this very closely.
*03:40.740- 03:47.520* :  And Luis, this comes as lawmakers discussing the controversial economic reforms planned by
*03:47.520- 03:49.820* :  the President. Tell us more about that.
*03:50.800- 03:56.100* :  Certainly, President Miele, of course, was elected on the promise of carrying out extensive
*03:56.100- 04:02.020* :  reform in the Argentinian economy, specifically in the state, in the first few months of his
*04:02.020- 04:07.860* :  administration. He has managed to turn a very large budget deficit into a surplus.
*04:08.320- 04:14.400* :  Of course, the cost of this has been a very, very drastic cut in government expenditures,
*04:15.000- 04:20.200* :  including social expenditures that were directed towards the more vulnerable people in society.
*04:20.620- 04:24.640* :  Now, Congress was discussing a measure that would allow him to continue with this,
*04:24.640- 04:30.000* :  deepening with this process, privatizing companies, reducing the size of the state,
*04:30.300- 04:35.580* :  as you may recall during his presidential campaign, one of the strongest image of him in
*04:35.580- 04:39.780* :  campaign was him wielding a chainsaw and saying he was going to wield a chainsaw to cut
*04:39.780- 04:44.560* :  through the Argentinian state, which he described as bloated, inefficient, and corrupt.
*04:44.560- 04:49.340* :  And this, of course, has created a lot of protests, which we are seeing today, of course.
*04:49.780- 04:55.960* :  And how widespread is opposition to his reforms within Parliament itself?
*04:56.980- 05:03.580* :  President Miele has a very strong opposition by the peronist party. The left is the center,
*05:03.580- 05:09.900* :  left political movement that has dominated Argentinian politics for a long time since, at least
*05:09.900- 05:16.100* :  World War II, many, many years. And they are very, very strongly against Miele's proposal.
*05:16.100- 05:21.000* :  So he has faced very strong opposition also in the provincial governance and, of course,
*05:21.000- 05:25.720* :  a lot of protests by labor unions and these kinds of civil society organizations.
*05:26.480- 05:31.960* :  Luis Fajardo, it is time for the haggling to stop and this ceasefire to begin,
*05:31.960- 05:37.380* :  the words of the U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, as he wrapped up his eighth tour
*05:37.380- 05:41.680* :  of the Middle East in a bid to finally secure a halt to the fighting in Gaza.
*05:42.280- 05:45.840* :  But despite all the diplomacy and a UN Security Council resolution,
*05:45.840- 05:51.040* :  an agreement still seems elusive. Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman is
*05:51.040- 05:55.720* :  travelling with Mr Blinken and sent us this report from the Katari capital, Doha.
*05:56.400- 06:03.160* :  We're in the motorcade racing through cleared streets of Doha. As Anthony Blinken and the
*06:03.840- 06:10.600* :  armoured car ahead of us continues this diplomacy at high speed trying to keep this ceasefire
*06:10.600- 06:21.120* :  proposal afloat. There was an embrace and smiles as America's chief diplomat met the Prime
*06:21.120- 06:27.120* :  Minister of Qatar. The country is a key player in this crisis. For more than a decade having hosted
*06:27.120- 06:33.580* :  the political offices of Hamas, Doha has been a conduit in the Gulf for negotiations with Israel.
*06:34.380- 06:39.000* :  Last night, Hamas gave its response to the Gaza ceasefire for hostage release proposal
*06:39.420- 06:44.900* :  outlined by President Biden 12 days ago. The Secretary of State who spent much of the night
*06:44.900- 06:50.660* :  assessing the latest text seemed exasperated. Hamas could have answered with a single word.
*06:51.480- 06:58.200* :  Yes, instead, Hamas waited nearly two weeks and then proposed more changes, a number of which go
*06:58.200- 07:04.960* :  beyond positions that had previously taken and accepted. As a result, the war that Hamas started
*07:05.300- 07:10.640* :  will go on, more people will suffer, while Palestinians will suffer, more Israelis will suffer.
*07:11.600- 07:17.120* :  Mr Blinken did not clarify what changes he said Hamas was demanding. It's understood it seeks
*07:17.120- 07:22.680* :  assurances the ceasefire would be permanent and that Israeli troops would be fully withdrawn from
*07:22.680- 07:28.600* :  Gaza. These measures are referenced in the existing proposal but there are caveats around
*07:28.600- 07:35.080* :  their timing and certainty. Hamas denies it has put forward new ideas but the reality remains
*07:35.080- 07:41.000* :  that the proposed deal is stuck between Hamas accused of trying to change it and Israel which
*07:41.000- 07:47.840* :  is decidedly lukewarm at best about the provisions already on the table. Mr Blinken said some of
*07:47.840- 07:54.060* :  Hamas's demands were unworkable but despite the setbacks, the US, he said along with Katari and
*07:54.060- 08:00.860* :  Egyptian officials would still try to close a deal. Tom Bateman, well as we just heard, part of that
*08:00.860- 08:07.140* :  deal involves the release of all hostages. There are still around 120 captives being held in Gaza,
*08:07.600- 08:12.840* :  eight months after they were abducted by Hamas. Last weekend, four hostages were released
*08:12.840- 08:18.400* :  in an operation by Israeli forces. Among them was a Russian Israeli man Andrei Kozlov.
*08:18.920- 08:24.020* :  I'm at least correspondent Lucy Woonson has spoken to his parents and has sent us this report.
*08:28.160- 08:34.980* :  Hard to tell from inside captivity the sound of fighting from the sound of freedom.
*08:38.060- 08:45.500* :  Israeli hostages once again the target of a surprise attack this time by special forces come to rescue
*08:45.500- 08:52.980* :  them. Fear, still their first response. Huddled on a bed they gave their names.
*08:55.660- 09:00.840* :  Among them Andrei Kozlov, a 27-year-old man kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival
*09:01.380- 09:07.760* :  in the 7th of October attacks. Don't be scared, the soldier says. We're here to rescue you.
*09:10.580- 09:16.840* :  His father Michael said eight months of brainwashing by his captors had left Andrei afraid of his own
*09:16.840- 09:23.580* :  saviors. They were told to speak in whispers so that drones overhead couldn't hear them speaking
*09:23.580- 09:29.280* :  Hebrew and destroy the building to rid Israel of the problem posed by the hostages. When the
*09:29.280- 09:34.460* :  special forces came for him he hoped they wanted to kill him. He wasn't sure if it was a rescue
*09:34.460- 09:40.400* :  operation or an assassination. The rescue of Andrei and three other hostages was a boost to
*09:40.400- 09:46.200* :  Israel's Prime Minister but the operation caused mass Palestinian casualties and showed the
*09:46.200- 09:53.980* :  challenge in freeing the other 120 hostages by force. Ending the war is the price for releasing them
*09:53.980- 10:00.560* :  Hamas says. If Benjamin Netanyahu wants to save his hard right government that might be a price
*10:00.560- 10:07.200* :  too high. Lucy Williamson. In France President Immanuel Macron is calling on parties and voters
*10:07.200- 10:13.180* :  to say no to extremes. Speaking at a news conference in Paris he defended his surprise decision
*10:13.180- 10:19.240* :  to call snap election urging centrist parties to work together after the far-right national rally
*10:19.240- 10:22.700* :  came out on top in Sunday's votes for the European Parliament.
*10:32.300- 10:37.300* :  The Republican right or at least its leader has for the first time formed an alliance with the
*10:37.300- 10:42.640* :  far-right and I do mean the far-right when I say the national rally because its leaders continue
*10:42.640- 10:47.860* :  to say that there are real and fake French people and continue to contemplate curtailing the
*10:47.860- 10:55.060* :  freedom of the press or rejecting the rule of law. Meanwhile France's centre-right opposition group
*10:55.060- 11:00.700* :  the Republican Party has moved to replace its leader Erick Siotta after he proposed an alliance
*11:00.700- 11:07.000* :  with the far-right national rally. Our Paris correspondent Husker Phil told me more about where
*11:07.000- 11:12.580* :  this leaves the party. They've rejected him but there's going to be a long legal wrangle now over
*11:12.580- 11:18.060* :  the kind of rules and it might well go to court because he's saying that they have got the power
*11:18.060- 11:23.320* :  to oust him as as leader. In effect he's out because you know no one wants to talk to him and
*11:23.320- 11:28.640* :  you know he's ostracised but whether technically he remains the Republicans party to do is another
*11:28.640- 11:35.300* :  matter and he may you know he clearly has been rejected by the important members of the Republican
*11:35.300- 11:40.020* :  Party and most of the other of their MPs for example but his argument is that at the grassroots
*11:40.020- 11:45.560* :  level among people who are activists for the party you know just ordinary people around the country
*11:45.860- 11:49.880* :  there's much more support for what he's doing which is suggesting this alliance with the
*11:50.520- 11:55.100* :  with the RN national rally so you know we're in a slightly odd odd phase where he's clearly
*11:55.100- 12:02.900* :  been ejected but he says he's proceeding with his plan which is to get candidates which are
*12:02.900- 12:09.300* :  acceptable to the RN the national rally in in a number of constituencies but on the left
*12:09.300- 12:15.360* :  they're far more unified aren't they? Well they have agreed to you know to share out
*12:16.240- 12:20.300* :  that the whole the country into different constituencies so that each of the five parties
*12:20.300- 12:25.480* :  of the left has a has a certain share out and that way they'll have a unified front at the elections
*12:25.540- 12:29.020* :  and that I mean obviously that's a good news for them that means they won't be fighting against
*12:29.020- 12:33.240* :  each other but I think the problem for the left is that I mean everyone has seen what
*12:33.880- 12:36.960* :  that you know that this is a sort of marriage of convenience and it's you know
*12:36.960- 12:41.160* :  there but everyone knows that the socialists for example and most of them are a complete
*12:41.160- 12:46.320* :  log ahead with the LFI which is the party for Jean-Luc Mélenchon so you know there's a lot of
*12:46.320- 12:52.820* :  deep division in the middle of that which you know may or may not mean that it all comes unstuck
*12:52.820- 12:58.020* :  before the elections. I mean it is just three days it seems not longer than that since President
*12:58.020- 13:04.400* :  Macron called this snap election I mean the picture seems to be confusion in French politics
*13:04.400- 13:10.400* :  is that fair? Well absolutely it's fair it is confusing though I think a pattern is
*13:10.400- 13:15.020* :  beginning to emerge and you know and Macron and classic fashion is trying to impose his
*13:15.820- 13:20.160* :  interpretation of it all on the country and you know it's one which has a certain logic which
*13:20.160- 13:25.040* :  is that once again he finds himself master of families in the middle controlling the center
*13:25.620- 13:32.440* :  with on the right you know it's obviously extremely vibrant, resurgent national rally now with
*13:32.440- 13:39.520* :  some allies in the mainstream conservative party so he's able to say well the right going to
*13:39.520- 13:45.120* :  the extreme and on the left he's got the socialists all the way to the LFI together and he could
*13:45.120- 13:49.460* :  say well they're all going to the extreme because there's no sort of you know there's no normal
*13:49.460- 13:54.260* :  social democratic party that's not linked to the extreme is there so he says the only way you can
*13:54.260- 14:00.940* :  vote and then sort of responsibly is for me in the center. You scurfield in Paris he became known
*14:00.940- 14:06.080* :  internationally under the nickname the Banco to the poor Mohammed Yunus was awarded the Nobel
*14:06.080- 14:13.280* :  Peace Prize in 2006 for finding the pioneering microfinance bank Grammine which is credited with
*14:13.280- 14:18.820* :  lifting millions of people out of poverty but now he's been indicted in a corruption case and
*14:18.820- 14:25.140* :  earlier this year he was convicted of violating Bangladesh's labor laws in a trial decried by his
*14:25.140- 14:30.540* :  supporters as politically motivated. The country's prime minister Sheikh Hussainah has accused Mr.
*14:30.540- 14:36.880* :  Yunus of sucking blood from the poor. Julian Marshall spoke to Mohammed Yunus and began by asking
*14:36.880- 14:42.020* :  him why there's so much bad feeling between him and Sheikh Hussainah. I would say it's a billion
*14:42.020- 14:47.900* :  dollar question nobody can figure it out there's a question that they will be asked. Some explain
*14:47.900- 14:58.100* :  that is jealousy, personal rivalry or political threat or kind of a diversion from politics
*14:58.960- 15:06.060* :  move on to the real issues to something fake. I mean she calls you a blood sucker and says that
*15:06.060- 15:15.560* :  the rates that you charge on your loans are extortionate. That's right that's what she calls me the
*15:15.560- 15:21.580* :  blood sucker and I try to remind her or people who are listening saying that look I'm not the
*15:21.580- 15:27.340* :  owner of the bank so if somebody is sucking the blood it's not me I'm an employee of the bank
*15:28.080- 15:35.960* :  and I created this bank which is owned by the poor people 97% of the shares of the bank are with
*15:35.960- 15:41.100* :  the borders of the bank so it's simply give you a bad name that's all it doesn't have any justification
*15:41.100- 15:46.560* :  or anything else. I mean as a matter of interest what are the interest rates? It's 20%
*15:46.620- 15:52.220* :  including all the services that you provide at the village level and so on you have a huge
*15:52.220- 15:59.640* :  workforce to serve you and there's no collateral in the whole system. If I could turn to the
*15:59.640- 16:08.480* :  specific charges that have been leveled against you in court today that you and others
*16:08.540- 16:16.440* :  embezzled over two million dollars from Grammy in Telecom the two ran what's your defense?
*16:17.360- 16:23.040* :  The defense is there's nothing called embezzlement or anything this is a bank account in the name of
*16:23.040- 16:31.980* :  the workers the employees simply Telecom came to an understanding settlement agreement with the
*16:32.180- 16:38.280* :  trade union and under that agreement they put this money as a payment to all the 5% shares of the
*16:38.720- 16:46.940* :  profit that was an issue that was fought over in the court. You've also got this case against you
*16:46.940- 16:54.100* :  actually it's resulted in a six-month jail term on labor law violations which are appealing against
*16:55.060- 17:01.660* :  at the moment again your defense against that charge. This is a case where they were saying that
*17:01.660- 17:06.980* :  we didn't make the people permanent and the law says if you're worked for the company for
*17:06.980- 17:12.820* :  six months you automatically become permanent. You say that these charges against you are politically
*17:13.600- 17:19.160* :  motivated you've got to fight them in the courts but I mean if as you suggest the government the
*17:19.160- 17:24.160* :  authorities are out to get you they're going to get you aren't they and you could end up in prison.
*17:24.580- 17:28.620* :  Yeah I'm not the only one saying that this is politically motivated this is being said by
*17:28.620- 17:34.780* :  Amnesty International it's said by United Nations reporter on human rights and then
*17:35.220- 17:39.560* :  Clooney Foundation who followed the whole case through. I mean I've mentioned some of the
*17:39.560- 17:47.520* :  accusations that Shaker Sena was levelled against you but you equally have accused her of turning
*17:47.520- 17:54.620* :  Bangladesh into a one-party state. What's your evidence for that? Well the evidence is look at
*17:54.620- 18:00.560* :  other parties which exist. I mean this whole country is run by one party that's why I was explaining
*18:01.360- 18:06.020* :  it's not me the whole country believes in that. I mean it's quite an accusation to make
*18:06.860- 18:13.680* :  against the prime minister and you were then surprised that she is so venomous towards you.
*18:14.540- 18:21.720* :  Well it's not venomous against me for one time or other it's consistently it's going off
*18:22.140- 18:26.820* :  for the last 20 years. So what does the future hold for you do you think Mohammed Yunus?
*18:27.000- 18:34.040* :  Not very bright it's a very dark future for me it's already a lot of a lot of pressure
*18:34.620- 18:39.140* :  this was a time but I thought I couldn't continue to work we have so many work to be done
*18:40.000- 18:47.360* :  and completely paralyzed because of the continuous appearance in the court and new allegations
*18:47.360- 18:54.440* :  coming in new statements moving out. So we can hardly work it's a life where you want to be active
*18:54.880- 18:59.480* :  now you feel like you are dead you can't do anything that's a most saddest part of the whole
*18:59.480- 19:04.560* :  thing that this is a time with the whole team that we have developed over years are so eager to
*19:04.560- 19:10.340* :  accomplish things and make things happen but that's not how it looks like. Nobel Peace laureate
*19:10.600- 19:17.440* :  Mohammed Yunus the ship on which the famous polar explorer Sir Eras Chakleton made his final voyage
*19:17.440- 19:23.780* :  and where he died of a heart attack has finally been located. The wreck is lying deep off the coast
*19:23.780- 19:30.560* :  of Newfoundland in Canada. The Anglo-Arish explorer died on board the quest in 1922
*19:30.560- 19:37.720* :  on route to the Antarctic. Here's an extract from his last diary entry. Fourth of January in 1922
*19:38.520- 19:45.140* :  at last after 16 days of turmoil and anxiety on a peaceful sunshining day we came to anchor
*19:45.380- 19:52.480* :  Ingrid Vicken how familiar the coast seemed as we passed down. We saw with full interest the places we
*19:52.480- 19:58.700* :  struggled over after the boat journey. Now we must speed all we can but the prospect is not too
*19:58.700- 20:06.380* :  bright for labor is scarce. The old smell of dead whale permeates everything. It's a strange and
*20:06.380- 20:13.820* :  curious place. Well after that voyage back in the 1920s the ship had different roles ending its
*20:13.820- 20:21.200* :  existence as an Norwegian sailboat before it sinking in 1962. David Merns is part of the team who've
*20:21.200- 20:26.460* :  been searching for the remains of the vessel. So how can he be sure they've actually found
*20:26.460- 20:33.520* :  Chakleton's ship? All the factors are telling us it's the fact that there are no other ships
*20:33.880- 20:40.580* :  out here like this one and this matches exactly the characteristics the size or all the dimensions
*20:41.380- 20:49.180* :  length, breadth, height, the shape of the hull, everything the fact that we can see amassed
*20:50.260- 20:56.440* :  it's very clear that it's that it's quest and also it fits with the navigational position
*20:56.440- 21:02.780* :  and the analysis that we have about where it was located. So it's undoubtedly quest it can't be
*21:02.780- 21:08.720* :  anything else. Based on the sonar inventory it's an intact shipwreck it hasn't broken
*21:09.700- 21:18.520* :  it's lying upright on its keel slightly tilted over to ports it's not covered or anything
*21:18.520- 21:24.860* :  like that and so you know I expect to the extent that we'll be able to see the name I'm sure
*21:24.860- 21:31.260* :  that will be there and other numbers or things that are written on it that will absolutely identify it.
*21:32.240- 21:37.740* :  The whole purpose of this is to bring this story to new generations. Chakleton will live forever
*21:38.580- 21:46.380* :  as one of the greatest not just polar explorers but explorers of all time because not just of what
*21:46.380- 21:51.560* :  he achieved in exploration but his the way he did it and the way he looked after his men
*21:52.020- 21:57.760* :  and that's a that's a story that will be timeless and be told and told and told again.
*21:58.760- 21:59.360* :  David Burns
*22:02.160- 22:12.400* :  Still to come on the global news podcast? I always like to show pleasure, life and some you know
*22:12.400- 22:20.240* :  the futureness I would say futureness in people. Ghana celebrates the pioneering photographer James

*23:34.140- 23:39.780* :  The shock in India after dozens of the country's nationals were caught up in a fire at a residential
*23:39.780- 23:45.560* :  building in Kuwait. At least 49 people were killed. Most of them foreign workers and many more
*23:45.560- 23:51.100* :  were injured. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his condolences and is sending
*23:51.100- 23:57.260* :  a junior minister to the Gulf state. Asad Aja Eja and Barathan Etherachan is following developments.
*23:58.300- 24:03.580* :  This particular incident has triggered lots of concerns in India, particularly in the state of
*24:03.580- 24:08.780* :  Kerala from where thousands of people work in the Gulf countries, particularly in Kuwait.
*24:09.520- 24:16.800* :  Now the fact that Mr. Modi has tweeted saying he was worried about those were injured and offered
*24:16.800- 24:24.000* :  condolences for those died shows that a majority of those who died in this unfortunate incident
*24:24.640- 24:30.340* :  happen to be Indians, Indian nationals. This particular apartment block, according to Indian
*24:30.340- 24:36.900* :  media, was full of Indian workers from different parts of the country. Indian media reports are
*24:36.900- 24:43.680* :  quoting a very high figure of more than 40 of those who died could be Indians. The newspapers in
*24:43.680- 24:49.340* :  the southern state of Kerala have been giving the details of those who died in this incident.
*24:49.340- 24:56.260* :  That is why Mr. Modi held a high level meeting, including the foreign minister, Mr. Jay Shankar.
*24:56.940- 25:05.060* :  One of the junior ministers is leaving soon to coordinate work and coordinate help for those
*25:05.060- 25:10.400* :  who are injured. The Indian ambassador there also has visited people and hospitals. It is
*25:11.100- 25:16.260* :  really a testing time for the relatives of those who killed and for those who are injured in
*25:16.260- 25:22.200* :  this incident back in India. What do we know about this fire? What do we know about what caused it
*25:22.200- 25:28.780* :  and what kind of condition this residential building was in? It is very common for hundreds of
*25:29.200- 25:34.080* :  expatriate workers, particularly those who come from South and Southeast Asia. They live in
*25:34.700- 25:40.920* :  one apartment block in clusters. We still don't know what triggered the fire, but one worker
*25:40.920- 25:45.740* :  was quoted as saying that it started in the lower floors and then it spread very quickly,
*25:45.740- 25:51.000* :  which means basically it trapped those who were living in these higher floors and many of them died
*25:51.000- 25:57.380* :  of inhaling smoke even more than the fire. It was a concrete building and there was no proper
*25:57.380- 26:03.700* :  in a how to get out of this fire exits or not. One of the security officials was saying that
*26:04.040- 26:09.000* :  he was blaming those property developers and the building owners of not following
*26:10.180- 26:15.960* :  the rules and that is leading to such incidents. So the quite the officials, however, have not come
*26:15.960- 26:22.680* :  out to the details of the nationalities of those killed, but what we hear is mostly from outside
*26:22.680- 26:29.540* :  Kuwait, from the media in India. And Barusan Etherachen. He's regarded as Ghana's first photo
*26:29.540- 26:35.320* :  journalist and one of the pioneering photographers in Africa. James Barner has spent more than six
*26:35.320- 26:42.260* :  decades capturing pivotal moments through his lens. As he turns 95, his remarkable journey is
*26:42.260- 26:47.820* :  being honored in Ghana's capital city Accra, with a series of exhibitions, screenings and concerts
*26:48.180- 26:50.500* :  showcasing his work. Thomas Nadi reports.
*26:53.120- 26:57.260* :  It's a liberation of life and an extraordinary photojournalism career.
*27:02.200- 27:08.520* :  It is a generous started in Jamestown, a historic suburb of Accra, where he establishes famous
*27:08.520- 27:18.300* :  ever-young studio in the early 1950s. I photographed all the big politicians right from the beginning
*27:19.140- 27:29.260* :  and I photographed in Britain, Muhammad Ali, as well as returning to Ghana to introduce
*27:29.260- 27:38.620* :  color printing. Before then, anybody who took color photographs in Ghana sent it to Europe to be
*27:38.620- 27:53.620* :  developed. I always like to show pleasure, life and some, you know, the futureness, I would say
*27:53.620- 28:03.580* :  futureness in people when I see them. And I like people more than places because I had that
*28:03.820- 28:07.920* :  thing in my mind. People are more interesting than places.
*28:10.320- 28:17.380* :  Barner was not widely recognized until a 2007 Black Cultural Archives exhibition showcased his
*28:17.380- 28:23.640* :  work when he turned 80. Many believe he has contributed immensely to photography in this part of
*28:23.640- 28:30.260* :  the world. But even at 95, James Barner believes there's still more to be done.
*28:31.260- 28:42.100* :  When I was 80, I felt then like 21. I just started because there's so much to do. I haven't done all.
*28:46.220- 28:52.500* :  James Barner there speaking to Thomas Nadi in Accra. The EU health agency has warned that cases of
*28:52.500- 28:58.480* :  dengue fever and other diseases spread by mosquitoes are rising significantly on the European
*28:58.480- 29:04.440* :  continent. Scientists say that climate change is one of the reasons why the invasive tiger mosquito
*29:04.440- 29:10.800* :  has set up home in 13 countries in the European Union and officials have warned that international
*29:10.800- 29:16.640* :  travel will further increase the risk of more European outbreaks of disease. More details from
*29:16.640- 29:21.920* :  our health reporter, Philippa Roxby. Mosquitoes have been a growing threat in Europe for nearly two
*29:21.920- 29:29.220* :  decades. One species called aidosalbopictus or Asian tiger is now established in 13 countries,
*29:29.220- 29:34.880* :  including France, Germany, Spain and Greece. It's also been spotted as far north as Belgium.
*29:34.880- 29:41.200* :  Disease experts say climate change is creating favorable conditions for the insects. They transmit
*29:41.200- 29:48.220* :  viral infections like dengue, which causes flu-like symptoms for most, but can be fatal in severe cases.
*29:48.760- 29:54.880* :  Figures from last year show a steep rise in infections in Europe. Most cases, nearly 5,000,
*29:54.880- 30:01.200* :  are linked to international travel, but a growing number, around 130, were acquired locally.
*30:02.040- 30:07.780* :  Mark Alawidosen, lead on high-threat pathogens for the World Health Organization, explains the
*30:07.780- 30:13.740* :  reasons. We are seeing a global increase in dengue, really very marked increase in dengue for a
*30:13.740- 30:20.100* :  variety of reasons, including urbanisation, climate change, and of course, people come to Europe,
*30:20.720- 30:26.520* :  tourists and otherwise, with dengue and therefore introduce potentially the virus into European
*30:26.520- 30:32.600* :  populations, and then it can get transmitted. To date, dengue cases in Europe have been mostly mild,
*30:32.620- 30:37.220* :  but the worry is that in future, with warming summer temperatures and more infections,
*30:37.220- 30:43.780* :  that could change. Tago mosquitoes bite during the daytime and are quite aggressive, avoiding them
*30:43.780- 30:49.240* :  can be a challenge. There is concern that the Olympic Games in Paris this summer could raise the
*30:49.240- 30:55.600* :  risk of more European outbreaks. Advice to the public is to use repellent, wear clothes that cover
*30:55.600- 31:00.380* :  the skin, and empty stagnant water from gardens, where mosquitoes can breed.
*31:01.240- 31:07.780* :  Philippa Roxby. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the news, or just by modern life in general,
*31:07.780- 31:14.680* :  perhaps you've dreamt of escaping to a remote island. Well, if you got around $650,000 to spare,
*31:14.680- 31:20.300* :  you could bite milligram, an island about half an hour by boat, off the northwest coast of Scotland.
*31:20.300- 31:25.520* :  It's said to have stunning views, but not a lot else. There's no running water, no animals,
*31:25.520- 31:31.700* :  and no trees. Tempted, well, for an insight into the sort of experience it might offer,
*31:31.700- 31:38.120* :  we turned to the writer Adam Nicholson, author of Seerum, an island life, about his time on the
*31:38.120- 31:44.480* :  Shant Islands. Three tiny islands also off the coast of Scotland, and we asked him to reflect on their
*31:44.480- 31:51.620* :  beauty and meaning. There's nothing quite like the moment when you're left on a remote Scottish
*31:51.620- 31:57.420* :  island alone or with friends. You suddenly feel that there's something about this place and this
*31:57.420- 32:04.900* :  geography that is different from the rest of the world. You slow down, you attend to things more
*32:04.900- 32:11.740* :  closely, you don't care about the news, and every day grows wonderfully long.
*32:14.860- 32:19.480* :  Since I was a boy in the 1960s, I've been going to the Shant Islands in the Hebrides,
*32:20.560- 32:24.960* :  just across the mince from Mullagrach in the Summer Isles that is now for sale.
*32:26.780- 32:32.960* :  And when my father first took me there, I couldn't quite believe the world was as full of drama
*32:33.520- 32:40.180* :  as this place of cliffs and surging seas, of hundreds of thousands of visiting summer sea birds,
*32:40.920- 32:44.040* :  hawking and spitting and bellowing around us.
*32:47.600- 32:55.420* :  All that among all this incredibly dynamic life, I could feel quite so alive. It was pure
*32:55.420- 33:03.360* :  stimulus for me. And that is a sensation that has never left me, rekindled every time I go back
*33:04.440- 33:11.460* :  knowing that an island mysteriously allows one to be more present in one's own life than anywhere
*33:11.460- 33:19.920* :  else you could imagine. People always talk about getting away, but island times feel like the opposite
*33:19.920- 33:29.400* :  of that, getting into something, even getting under something. And so you spend your time exploring
*33:29.400- 33:35.360* :  every nook and crevice, inspecting every strange nest of shag and cormorant,
*33:36.000- 33:41.780* :  trying to get close to sleeping seals, very occasionally finding a basking shark,
*33:41.820- 33:51.840* :  or a minkey whale, easing its way past the beaches. So the point where, however small and uninhabited
*33:51.840- 33:58.100* :  the island might be, it seems as if you scarcely need anything else.
*33:59.780- 34:06.680* :  Adam Nicholson. And finally, the American songwriter Mark James, who wrote two of Elvis Presley's
*34:06.680- 34:12.480* :  best known hits, has died. He was 83. Over the course of his career, the composer's work was
*34:12.480- 34:18.120* :  recorded or covered by artists including Willie Nelson, Jay Z, The Pet Shop Boys, and Michael
*34:18.120- 34:21.120* :  Bubley. A music correspondent Mark Savage has more.
*34:23.940- 34:29.800* :  Mark James' original recording of Suspicious Minds was a flop, then Elvis Presley heard it and
*34:29.800- 34:37.500* :  demanded to make his own version. It became the star's last number one single in America,
*34:38.080- 34:41.740* :  and James went on to write several more hits for Elvis, including this.
*34:41.900- 34:50.180* :  You were always on my mind. Released as a B-side in 1973, it later became a major hit for Willie
*34:50.180- 34:56.320* :  Nelson, earning James a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The musician died at his home in Nashville
*34:56.320- 35:01.820* :  over the weekend. Mark Savage on Mark James, who's died at the age of 83.
