*01:25.680- 01:30.420* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 26th of June,
*01:30.420- 01:36.980* :  these are our main stories. Kenya's president has accused criminals of hijacking huge protests against
*01:36.980- 01:43.420* :  tax rises during which parliament buildings were set on fire and five people were shot dead by police.
*01:44.180- 01:49.200* :  The 14-year legal battle of Julian Assange is drawing to a close with the WikiLeaks founder
*01:49.600- 01:54.620* :  having arrived in court on a remote U.S. island in the Pacific for a brief court hearing.
*01:54.620- 02:00.880* :  A trial has started in Ecuador of five people charged with killing a presidential candidate last year.
*02:03.620- 02:08.540* :  Also in this podcast, the letter signed by Albert Einstein is a version of one
*02:08.540- 02:11.800* :  center president Roosevelt, written in 1939.
*02:12.640- 02:17.280* :  The document which warns about the danger of nuclear bombs is up for sale.
*02:21.480- 02:27.600* :  The Kenyan president William Ruto has described violence during huge protests against tax rises
*02:27.960- 02:30.820* :  as an unprecedented attack on the country's democracy.
*02:30.820- 02:35.780* :  Medics say at least five people were shot dead by police in Nairobi as protesters
*02:35.780- 02:40.760* :  broke through cordons, parts of the parliament complex and city hall were set alight.
*02:41.180- 02:45.620* :  In a televised address, Mr Ruto expressed determination to combat violence.
*02:45.620- 02:53.860* :  It is very painful for Kenya that a conversation this crucial was hijacked by dangerous people
*02:54.720- 03:02.480* :  who have caused us the kind of loss we have we have incurred as a nation today.
*03:03.700- 03:11.620* :  I assure the nation of the government's determination to fulfill its constitutional duty
*03:12.340- 03:16.400* :  of protecting the people of Kenya against all forms of harm.
*03:17.460- 03:23.340* :  Africa correspondent Barbara Platt Asher is in Nairobi and assesses the protests and the
*03:23.340- 03:24.280* :  effect on the country.
*03:24.640- 03:32.480* :  protesters have been flooding the streets of Nairobi and other major Kenyan towns
*03:32.480- 03:35.340* :  rejecting a new finance bill that increases taxes.
*03:36.040- 03:37.640* :  There have been demonstrations for a week now.
*03:37.940- 03:39.320* :  This was the biggest so far.
*03:42.120- 03:46.660* :  It's an organic movement formed by young people on social media and it's caught the government
*03:46.660- 03:52.080* :  by surprise. Protesters like Christine Muhindi say this is about their future.
*03:53.820- 03:55.680* :  Kenya for even our children.
*03:56.480- 03:58.380* :  We are trying to make an impact.
*03:59.140- 04:03.220* :  Hope the government listens to us and does something.
*04:03.380- 04:07.120* :  Even though they passed this bill, Kenyans have awakened.
*04:07.680- 04:10.160* :  Even though people are tear gas, we are still going.
*04:10.900- 04:13.120* :  But the tension increased as the day wore on.
*04:14.500- 04:18.860* :  Police fired round after round of tear gas to stop the chanting youths from reaching parliament.
*04:19.660- 04:20.560* :  Then it turned lethal.
*04:22.180- 04:25.860* :  Police switched to live ammunition when protesters breached and entered the building,
*04:26.480- 04:27.640* :  killing and injuring some.
*04:28.500- 04:32.720* :  Members of parliament who had just voted to pass the tax bill were whisked away to safety
*04:33.260- 04:34.680* :  part of the building caught fire.
*04:35.580- 04:38.980* :  As evening fell, President William Ruto addressed the nation.
*04:39.300- 04:46.240* :  Today's events mark a critical turning point on how we respond to grave threats
*04:47.340- 04:48.520* :  to our national security.
*04:49.020- 04:55.540* :  I assure the nation that the government has mobilized all resources at the nation's disposal
*04:55.540- 05:04.240* :  to ensure that a situation of this nature will not recur again at whatever cost.
*05:04.400- 05:08.680* :  I have directed all the organs of our national security to deploy measures
*05:08.860- 05:18.780* :  to toward any attempt by dangerous criminals to undermine the security and stability of our country.
*05:19.060- 05:21.620* :  He said the protests had been hijacked by criminals,
*05:22.200- 05:25.800* :  but he still wanted a dialogue with the young people who had raised pertinent issues.
*05:26.620- 05:31.880* :  This is uncharted territory for the president. Kenyans powerful are facing an unprecedented
*05:31.880- 05:33.340* :  challenge from the people.
*05:37.220- 05:40.320* :  While the police in Nairobi try to restore order there,
*05:40.320- 05:43.120* :  a contingent of Kenyan police has arrived in Haiti.
*05:43.120- 05:48.540* :  This is to lead a much-anticipated international force to tackle the gang violence there.
*05:48.860- 05:50.480* :  That is spiraled in recent months.
*05:50.920- 05:55.100* :  Jacqueline Charles is the Caribbean correspondent for the Miami Herald,
*05:55.100- 06:00.180* :  who says that despite the protests at home, the Kenyan police would stay on mission.
*06:00.680- 06:02.040* :  I do not see them turning back.
*06:02.040- 06:06.600* :  In fact, President Biden just issued a statement expressing gratitude to Kenyan
*06:06.600- 06:10.400* :  all the countries that are participating in this multinational security support mission
*06:10.900- 06:14.940* :  and reiterating that this is very important for Haitians and for Haiti.
*06:14.940- 06:17.280* :  The Haitians deserve security like everyone else.
*06:17.720- 06:20.920* :  These police officers from Kenya, they are part of an elite group.
*06:21.140- 06:26.620* :  We've been told all along by the Kenyans that their participation is not going to affect
*06:27.360- 06:29.480* :  their efforts for security in Kenya.
*06:29.480- 06:32.960* :  But it is a dramatic situation that's unfolding right now.
*06:33.380- 06:36.240* :  The Haitian national police, despite their many challenges,
*06:36.240- 06:38.520* :  they managed to push back the gangs.
*06:39.060- 06:41.960* :  But once a neighborhood has been lost to gangs,
*06:41.960- 06:45.400* :  they can't really take it back or keep control of it.
*06:45.700- 06:50.180* :  They need to help, but will 2,500 police officers, not just from Kenya,
*06:50.180- 06:51.780* :  but from several other countries.
*06:52.000- 06:53.540* :  Will they be able to make a difference?
*06:53.540- 06:54.580* :  I don't know.
*06:54.600- 06:56.900* :  I mean, we've gone from where the debate was about.
*06:57.060- 07:01.140* :  We don't want intervention to where desperate for any kind of help that we can.
*07:01.140- 07:03.760* :  So there's been a lot of hope that's been put on this group.
*07:03.760- 07:07.320* :  And we still don't know what the rules of engagement are.
*07:07.320- 07:09.240* :  Are they going to be participating in operations?
*07:09.360- 07:12.780* :  Are they going to be protecting just government infrastructures
*07:12.780- 07:15.240* :  that have come under attack in the last couple of months?
*07:15.240- 07:17.320* :  Or are they going to go out and help the Haitian police
*07:17.320- 07:18.820* :  actually dismantle gangs?
*07:18.820- 07:21.680* :  We're still waiting to see what those rules are going to be.
*07:22.160- 07:26.260* :  Jacqueline Charles, the Caribbean correspondent for the Miami Herald.
*07:27.300- 07:31.900* :  The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has arrived at court in the Northern
*07:31.900- 07:35.240* :  Mariana Islands, a remote U.S. territory in the Pacific,
*07:35.240- 07:40.400* :  where he's expected to enter a plea deal that should result in him being set free.
*07:40.860- 07:43.660* :  He arrived on the main island, Saipan, from Bangkok,
*07:43.660- 07:47.820* :  having been released on bail from a British prison on Monday
*07:48.340- 07:49.440* :  under the terms of the deal.
*07:49.440- 07:51.680* :  He's appearing before a U.S. judge,
*07:52.040- 07:55.580* :  and will accept a deal that will allow him to fly home to Australia.
*07:56.080- 08:00.800* :  For the last 14 years, Julian Assange has been pursued by U.S. prosecutors
*08:00.800- 08:04.660* :  for leaking a vast amount of secret U.S. military information.
*08:05.220- 08:07.800* :  The Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese,
*08:08.200- 08:11.040* :  had lobbied the U.K. and U.S. for his release.
*08:11.540- 08:16.440* :  Regardless of the views that people have about Mr Assange's activities,
*08:16.800- 08:18.540* :  the case has dragged on for too long.
*08:19.500- 08:22.460* :  There's nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,
*08:22.620- 08:24.780* :  and we want him brought home to Australia.
*08:25.520- 08:28.860* :  I heard more about the proceedings on the remote U.S.
*08:28.860- 08:31.400* :  territory from our correspondent, Shama Khalil,
*08:31.700- 08:33.380* :  who is on the island of Saipan.
*08:33.780- 08:37.280* :  Well, I'm standing outside the U.S. District Court here in Saipan,
*08:37.280- 08:41.400* :  and this huge building, modern-looking building,
*08:41.400- 08:43.740* :  is overlooking a beautiful beach,
*08:43.900- 08:45.580* :  and it's lush green all around us,
*08:45.980- 08:47.220* :  and it's hot and humid,
*08:47.740- 08:50.400* :  and I cannot help but think what a contrast this is
*08:50.400- 08:54.380* :  from what Julian Assange has just left in London,
*08:54.380- 08:56.640* :  this prison cell in Belmarsh prison,
*08:57.060- 08:59.160* :  where he then boarded a plane to Bangkok,
*08:59.160- 09:02.080* :  and then landed here in Saipan.
*09:02.080- 09:05.500* :  And we're expecting him to plead guilty for one felony,
*09:05.500- 09:08.020* :  and that is illegally obtaining and disclosing
*09:08.620- 09:10.680* :  national security material.
*09:11.100- 09:12.920* :  No prison sentence, no prison time,
*09:12.920- 09:15.060* :  because as part of the deal,
*09:15.680- 09:20.700* :  he will be given credit for prison time spent in the UK.
*09:20.700- 09:25.280* :  After that, Julian Assange will technically and officially
*09:25.280- 09:28.260* :  be walking out of here a free man to head to Australia.
*09:28.580- 09:31.020* :  And as you say, it's quite a turnaround.
*09:31.020- 09:34.700* :  He was in the highest security jail in the UK.
*09:34.700- 09:36.680* :  And at one point, it looked like he was going to face
*09:37.160- 09:39.460* :  many, many charges and could be in jail,
*09:39.920- 09:40.920* :  extradited to the US.
*09:40.920- 09:42.480* :  It could be in jail for a very long time.
*09:43.040- 09:44.840* :  Remember the original prosecution,
*09:45.140- 09:48.220* :  they wanted to try him for 18 counts,
*09:48.460- 09:50.100* :  mainly under the Assange Act,
*09:50.580- 09:53.940* :  and mainly having to do with disclosing material,
*09:53.940- 09:56.540* :  or disclosing information, military information,
*09:57.060- 10:00.500* :  and diplomatic messages, and making them public.
*10:00.960- 10:04.320* :  And his lawyers have said that had he been convicted
*10:04.720- 10:06.880* :  of those charges, I think he would have been facing more
*10:06.880- 10:08.640* :  than 170 years in prison,
*10:08.640- 10:10.200* :  essentially his whole life in prison.
*10:10.200- 10:13.480* :  So quite a dramatic turnaround in this case,
*10:13.480- 10:15.040* :  with this deal that has been reached,
*10:15.040- 10:17.320* :  and of which we don't know many details actually,
*10:17.320- 10:21.440* :  even his wife was tight lipped about the details of this deal.
*10:22.180- 10:24.700* :  But it's also quite interesting, the location,
*10:24.700- 10:26.740* :  the reason why this picturesque,
*10:27.020- 10:29.020* :  remote US-specific island was chosen,
*10:29.020- 10:31.300* :  because it is not mainland United States,
*10:31.300- 10:33.280* :  because of this deep-seated mistrust
*10:33.640- 10:36.160* :  that Julian Assange has of the United States,
*10:36.160- 10:39.060* :  whom he had accused of trying to kill him in the past,
*10:39.160- 10:41.800* :  which is something that Washington has denied.
*10:41.800- 10:44.440* :  But he has refused to go to the United States,
*10:44.440- 10:47.380* :  and this is why here, in Saipan,
*10:47.440- 10:49.400* :  in this specific beautiful island,
*10:49.400- 10:53.260* :  is where the last chapter of this long and bitter standoff
*10:53.260- 10:56.160* :  between the US and Julian Assange will play out.
*10:56.440- 10:59.720* :  And briefly, he's facing a fairly hefty bill
*10:59.720- 11:00.660* :  for his flight ticket.
*11:01.140- 11:02.640* :  $500,000.
*11:02.780- 11:04.740* :  It is a very hefty bill,
*11:05.380- 11:06.640* :  and from what I understand,
*11:06.640- 11:08.340* :  and what the reports that we've read
*11:08.340- 11:11.940* :  is that they're going to find a way to try and pay it back.
*11:12.240- 11:16.240* :  How, when, and how long they'll need to campaign,
*11:16.240- 11:19.040* :  or to find the money, no one knows.
*11:19.040- 11:21.820* :  But yes, this flight across the world,
*11:21.820- 11:23.580* :  from London, through to Bangkok,
*11:23.580- 11:26.760* :  here in Saipan, all the way back to Australia,
*11:27.300- 11:29.100* :  comes at a very, very hefty bill.
*11:29.680- 11:33.340* :  Shyma Khalil on the remote Pacific Island of Saipan.
*11:34.020- 11:35.920* :  The charges against Julian Assange
*11:35.920- 11:37.880* :  have led some to brand him a criminal,
*11:37.880- 11:40.200* :  while others argue he is a champion
*11:40.200- 11:41.700* :  of the freedom of the press.
*11:42.160- 11:44.500* :  Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel,
*11:44.800- 11:46.740* :  has been charting the wavering opinions
*11:46.740- 11:48.400* :  of the WikiLeaks founder.
*11:48.920- 11:51.200* :  Julian Assange has long divided opinion.
*11:51.660- 11:54.520* :  To his supporters, he's been unjustly prosecuted
*11:54.520- 11:56.940* :  for revealing war crimes by Western forces
*11:57.440- 11:58.680* :  in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*11:59.480- 12:01.960* :  They say he has been persecuted for journalism
*12:01.980- 12:03.780* :  and paid a heavy price.
*12:04.220- 12:06.660* :  12 years of confinement and detention,
*12:06.660- 12:09.640* :  they say, has led to poor physical and mental health.
*12:10.280- 12:13.400* :  Followers, loyally demonstrated outside court hearings,
*12:13.420- 12:15.680* :  celebrities rallied to his cause.
*12:16.420- 12:17.400* :  During his seven years,
*12:17.400- 12:19.400* :  hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy,
*12:19.400- 12:22.720* :  he was visited several times by the former Playboy model,
*12:23.080- 12:24.000* :  Pamela Anderson.
*12:24.680- 12:27.440* :  Vaughn Smith is a longtime supporter of Mr Assange,
*12:27.900- 12:29.720* :  and the founder of the Frontline Club,
*12:30.040- 12:31.500* :  a gathering space for journalists.
*12:31.540- 12:35.760* :  He said Mr Assange had been smeared and bullied by the state.
*12:36.280- 12:38.660* :  The law hasn't been applied to him, in my view,
*12:38.660- 12:41.180* :  in the way that you or I would expect it to be applied to us.
*12:41.800- 12:43.860* :  The legal process has been weaponized,
*12:44.340- 12:45.800* :  and he's a physical prisoner,
*12:45.800- 12:48.700* :  and I think that's been quite a disappointing low.
*12:48.900- 12:50.220* :  But to Mr Assange's many critics,
*12:50.220- 12:52.600* :  he's an activist, not a journalist,
*12:52.600- 12:55.520* :  a seeker more of publicity than the truth,
*12:55.840- 12:57.400* :  a man whose criminal actions
*12:57.400- 13:00.260* :  put the lives of servicemen and women at risk
*13:00.260- 13:03.440* :  by leaking thousands of classified US military documents.
*13:04.040- 13:06.400* :  While Mr Assange hid in Ecuador's embassy,
*13:06.860- 13:08.640* :  Chelsea Manning, the former US soldier
*13:08.640- 13:10.460* :  who helped to obtain the documents,
*13:10.460- 13:12.660* :  faced the courts and was jailed.
*13:13.240- 13:16.220* :  Mr Assange's detractors note that sympathetic allies
*13:16.220- 13:19.700* :  and newspapers fell by the wayside as the years went on.
*13:19.700- 13:23.060* :  They point to his links to the Kremlin-backed television network,
*13:23.060- 13:26.840* :  RT, and how Ecuadorian diplomats lost patience
*13:26.840- 13:29.220* :  with this intense divisive figure.
*13:29.940- 13:32.500* :  Alexander Downer, the former Australian foreign minister,
*13:32.840- 13:35.180* :  said, just because Mr Assange was an Australian,
*13:35.760- 13:37.440* :  didn't mean he was a good bloke.
*13:37.640- 13:41.000* :  It's not appropriate to steal national security,
*13:41.000- 13:42.960* :  information, and publish it.
*13:43.540- 13:46.660* :  He released a huge amount of information,
*13:46.680- 13:49.020* :  much of which was very embarrassing
*13:49.020- 13:51.120* :  and some of which endangered lives.
*13:51.860- 13:53.940* :  What he did was a criminal offense
*13:53.940- 13:57.280* :  and it was a terrible thing to do morally as well.
*13:57.680- 13:59.560* :  And all this, while Swedish prosecutors
*13:59.560- 14:02.920* :  spent seven years seeking to arrest Mr Assange
*14:03.180- 14:05.240* :  for two allegations of sexual assault,
*14:05.620- 14:07.360* :  allegations which never came to court
*14:08.040- 14:09.520* :  and which he always denied.
*14:10.300- 14:13.120* :  Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel.
*14:14.280- 14:16.160* :  The trial has begun in Ecuador,
*14:16.160- 14:18.320* :  five people accused of assassinating
*14:18.320- 14:20.860* :  a presidential candidate nearly a year ago.
*14:21.260- 14:25.300* :  Fernando Vila Vicentio was shot in Quito last August.
*14:25.820- 14:28.760* :  Our America's regional editately and other Russia reports.
*14:29.380- 14:31.420* :  The five suspects, all of them from Ecuador,
*14:31.420- 14:33.600* :  were arrested at the scene and charged.
*14:33.960- 14:35.580* :  Another man from neighboring Colombia
*14:35.580- 14:37.300* :  was killed by security guards.
*14:37.340- 14:41.200* :  Many shots were fired and 12 people were injured at the rally.
*14:41.640- 14:44.580* :  Mr Viva says you are congressman and a former journalist,
*14:44.580- 14:47.740* :  campaigned against corruption and organized crime.
*14:48.200- 14:50.140* :  His killing highlighted Ecuador's failure
*14:50.140- 14:52.740* :  to deal with the increasing power of criminal gangs.
*14:53.240- 14:54.600* :  Over the past five years,
*14:54.620- 14:57.020* :  they've turned a largely peaceful country
*14:57.020- 14:59.140* :  into a major drug trafficking hub.
*14:59.580- 15:01.840* :  It's not clear who ordered the assassination.
*15:02.340- 15:04.020* :  But the Ecuadorian government at the time
*15:04.340- 15:07.700* :  accused one of Mexico's powerful drug cartels of involvement.
*15:08.760- 15:09.680* :  Leonardo Russia.
*15:10.520- 15:14.500* :  A letter from the German-born theoretical physicist Albert Einstein,
*15:14.500- 15:16.320* :  which encouraged the United States
*15:16.320- 15:18.680* :  to develop the world's first nuclear bomb
*15:19.060- 15:22.280* :  in response to the Nazis, is to go up for auction.
*15:22.620- 15:25.260* :  It's being sold in the US alongside other artifacts
*15:25.260- 15:27.580* :  relating to technology and innovation.
*15:27.580- 15:31.680* :  They were collected by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.
*15:32.160- 15:35.840* :  It's expected the letter could fetch up to nearly $6 million.
*15:36.640- 15:39.600* :  Our senior technology reporter, Chris Valenz, has more.
*15:40.140- 15:41.200* :  Over the course of his life,
*15:41.200- 15:44.540* :  Paul Allen used his wealth to amass a diverse array
*15:44.540- 15:46.380* :  of historically important artifacts.
*15:47.040- 15:48.540* :  His interest, besides computing,
*15:48.540- 15:51.900* :  included art, aviation, and popular culture.
*15:52.640- 15:54.540* :  The letter, signed by Albert Einstein,
*15:54.540- 15:57.120* :  is a version of one cent to President Roosevelt.
*15:57.540- 16:01.660* :  Written in 1939, days before the outbreak of war in Europe,
*16:02.020- 16:04.540* :  it highlighted the possibility of using uranium
*16:04.960- 16:06.280* :  to develop nuclear weapons.
*16:06.840- 16:09.520* :  And warned, this was something Germany was researching.
*16:10.380- 16:12.660* :  Mark Porter, chairman of Christie's Americas,
*16:13.000- 16:15.360* :  told the BBC that the ensuing development
*16:15.360- 16:17.560* :  of the Manhattan Project and after that,
*16:17.560- 16:20.540* :  the computing and the space age which came from it
*16:20.880- 16:22.040* :  was embodied in the letter.
*16:22.980- 16:25.980* :  Other items to be sold at auction include a space suit
*16:25.980- 16:28.040* :  belonging to US astronaut Ed White
*16:28.560- 16:31.200* :  and a restored computer from 1971
*16:31.980- 16:33.900* :  of the type that Mr. Allen and Bill Gates
*16:33.900- 16:36.520* :  first worked on prior to their founding Microsoft.
*16:37.040- 16:38.860* :  That report by Chris Valenz.
*16:41.440- 16:42.100* :  Still to come.
*16:42.280- 16:43.900* :  The skin is very soft and stretchable,
*16:43.960- 16:48.020* :  but the underlying robot face is very hard material.
*16:48.580- 16:51.220* :  Scientists in Japan have found a new way
*16:51.220- 16:56.420* :  to attach modified human skin to complex humanoid robot surfaces.
*17:06.020- 17:06.780* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.

*18:10.640- 18:12.620* :  This is the Global News Podcast.
*18:13.700- 18:16.780* :  The BBC can reveal the UK government has written off
*18:16.780- 18:20.180* :  or destroyed COVID-related personal protective equipment
*18:20.180- 18:23.640* :  or PPE worth almost $1.8 billion.
*18:24.560- 18:27.940* :  The stock was high quality and fully compliant with regulations.
*18:28.060- 18:30.640* :  It's thought to be the most wasteful deal
*18:30.980- 18:32.360* :  of the pandemic in the UK.
*18:32.900- 18:35.780* :  Tim Frank spoke to our Investigations reporter John
*18:35.780- 18:38.080* :  Arn Munger, who's been covering the story.
*18:38.620- 18:40.400* :  The company is full support healthcare.
*18:40.740- 18:42.460* :  It's got about 25 staff members.
*18:42.780- 18:44.600* :  It supplies PPE to the NHS.
*18:44.720- 18:46.060* :  It's been doing that for about 20 years.
*18:46.300- 18:49.500* :  And it was set up by a former nurse Sarah Stalk in 2001
*18:49.500- 18:53.320* :  and her husband Richard Stout became a director two years later.
*18:53.580- 18:55.220* :  Now before the COVID pandemic,
*18:55.220- 18:58.340* :  the company had annual profits of 800,000 pounds.
*18:58.760- 19:00.040* :  But all that was about to change
*19:00.040- 19:04.160* :  because in late 2019, as people started getting nervous
*19:04.160- 19:07.340* :  about signs of a virus spreading in China,
*19:07.680- 19:09.900* :  Sarah Stout was spurred to action.
*19:10.320- 19:13.120* :  She correctly predicted that demand would skyrocket
*19:13.120- 19:16.840* :  and mobilized huge quantities of PPE from China.
*19:17.100- 19:19.180* :  And then she just waited for the orders to roll in.
*19:19.220- 19:24.220* :  In April 2020, the UK government ordered 1.8 billion pounds
*19:24.220- 19:28.840* :  worth of PPE, mostly gowns, aprons, face masks, and goggles.
*19:28.840- 19:32.320* :  From full support, it was the biggest COVID PPE contract
*19:32.320- 19:33.720* :  by some margin.
*19:33.900- 19:35.840* :  And the stock was delivered by the summer.
*19:35.840- 19:38.900* :  It was of good quality and it was perfectly usable.
*19:39.320- 19:42.940* :  So it may come as a surprise that nearly all of the PPE
*19:42.940- 19:44.900* :  provided by Sarah Stout's company
*19:45.240- 19:47.680* :  will never be used in care settings.
*19:47.680- 19:49.620* :  Around a half of it's already been destroyed.
*19:50.180- 19:52.700* :  The other half is sitting in warehouses,
*19:52.700- 19:56.000* :  pending disposal at a further cost to the British taxpayer.
*19:56.500- 20:00.800* :  And by our calculations, that's around 1.4 billion pounds
*20:00.800- 20:04.020* :  worth of PPE from one contract up in smoke.
*20:04.480- 20:08.020* :  OK, so 1.4 billion pounds, which would convert here
*20:08.020- 20:10.980* :  on the world's service to about 1.8 billion dollars.
*20:11.460- 20:13.760* :  Do we know why this stuff isn't being used?
*20:13.800- 20:15.620* :  I mean, has it sort of just expired?
*20:16.060- 20:17.240* :  Yeah, there is an expiry.
*20:17.360- 20:18.980* :  And the Stouts have told us as much.
*20:19.080- 20:22.240* :  And because they sent it so soon in the pandemic,
*20:22.240- 20:24.720* :  they were one of the first suppliers to actually deliver
*20:24.720- 20:26.040* :  because of their background.
*20:26.040- 20:29.700* :  They have suggested that this is the reason that perhaps
*20:30.240- 20:31.220* :  it wasn't used.
*20:31.660- 20:33.100* :  It is just sitting around now.
*20:33.220- 20:36.460* :  We have put to the government why the PPE wasn't used
*20:36.460- 20:37.520* :  on several occasions.
*20:37.920- 20:39.780* :  They have said that our emails were missed
*20:39.860- 20:41.400* :  and they can't provide a statement now
*20:41.400- 20:42.780* :  because of the pre-election period.
*20:43.040- 20:45.340* :  However, in a press conference, the UK Health Secretary
*20:45.340- 20:47.500* :  of Victoria Atkins said that the government was going
*20:47.500- 20:49.200* :  to formally dispute the figure.
*20:49.560- 20:51.160* :  Are there any international comparisons
*20:51.160- 20:52.480* :  have you been able to look into that?
*20:52.760- 20:54.400* :  From what I've looked into, I don't think
*20:54.400- 20:57.920* :  we've seen in other countries comparable to the UK,
*20:57.920- 21:02.640* :  the same suddenly and then this subsequent rush
*21:02.640- 21:06.220* :  to procure such colossal amounts as the UK did.
*21:06.360- 21:08.680* :  There was a similar perhaps lack of preparedness
*21:08.680- 21:10.840* :  for the COVID pandemic if you like in France
*21:10.880- 21:14.000* :  because in 2018, after inspecting their national stock,
*21:14.000- 21:17.280* :  it was shown that there is a contained expired masks
*21:17.280- 21:19.320* :  and hundreds of millions were destroyed.
*21:19.320- 21:20.920* :  But crucially in France, there's a difference
*21:20.920- 21:23.900* :  because hospitals and doctors have the responsibility
*21:23.960- 21:26.820* :  of storing their own PPE and not the government.
*21:27.180- 21:29.060* :  Italy struggled too early on.
*21:29.140- 21:31.720* :  There were reports about this with signs of depleting PPE,
*21:32.060- 21:33.920* :  but as mentioned, they never got into the same
*21:33.920- 21:35.220* :  diastrates as the UK.
*21:35.640- 21:37.900* :  BBC reporter John Arnmunger.
*21:38.820- 21:40.480* :  As we heard in the earlier podcast,
*21:40.480- 21:44.740* :  a Chinese spacecraft Changi 6, which has gathered
*21:44.740- 21:48.420* :  the first soil and rock samples from the far side of the moon,
*21:48.940- 21:50.080* :  has returned to earth.
*21:50.400- 21:52.880* :  Scientists are eagerly awaiting to examine them
*21:52.880- 21:54.940* :  in the hope that they will deepen our understanding
*21:54.940- 21:57.260* :  of how the moon was formed and evolved.
*21:57.880- 22:02.020* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicca sent this report from Beijing.
*22:04.340- 22:08.940* :  The arrival of the Chang'e 6 was broadcast live to the nation.
*22:08.940- 22:12.040* :  State media described the soil and rock samples
*22:12.040- 22:16.580* :  as lunar treasures while the craft slowly bobbed to earth
*22:16.880- 22:20.980* :  under a parachute and finally landed in a desert in Inner Mongolia.
*22:21.660- 22:24.560* :  This is a clear source of Chinese pride
*22:24.980- 22:27.700* :  and a major accomplishment as John Pernie Fisher
*22:27.700- 22:29.960* :  from Manchester University explains.
*22:29.960- 22:33.260* :  This is the first time that we've got samples directly from
*22:33.260- 22:35.060* :  the lunar far side, the bit of moon
*22:35.180- 22:36.580* :  that we can't see up in the sky.
*22:36.580- 22:38.340* :  So from a technical point of view,
*22:38.340- 22:39.760* :  it's obviously quite complicated
*22:39.760- 22:42.640* :  and so it represents a good technical accomplishment,
*22:42.700- 22:45.100* :  but also from a sort of a scientific point of view,
*22:45.100- 22:47.100* :  the samples that have brought back are going to be quite unique.
*22:49.840- 22:52.200* :  Chang'e 6 blasted off in early May
*22:52.200- 22:55.540* :  and a few weeks later landed on the moon's south pole
*22:55.880- 22:57.880* :  when a mechanical arm and drill
*22:58.320- 23:00.420* :  spent two days gathering samples.
*23:01.200- 23:03.500* :  Chinese scientists believe these will include
*23:03.700- 23:06.480* :  two and a half million-year-old volcanic rock,
*23:06.480- 23:09.860* :  which could tell them if there's a source of water on the moon.
*23:10.480- 23:13.360* :  This mission is the culmination of decades of work.
*23:13.840- 23:16.600* :  President Xi Jinping has poured huge resources
*23:17.060- 23:20.260* :  into what he describes as China's space dream
*23:20.260- 23:24.300* :  in an effort to catch up with both the United States and Russia.
*23:24.980- 23:26.900* :  Laura Bicker in China.
*23:27.180- 23:29.640* :  So what does all this mean for space exploration
*23:29.640- 23:34.200* :  or even a future base for mankind on the lunar surface
*23:34.380- 23:36.920* :  to explain all this I spoke to our science correspondent,
*23:36.920- 23:38.240* :  Jonathan Amos.
*23:38.640- 23:42.360* :  The near side and the far side of the moon are quite different.
*23:42.360- 23:45.700* :  If you look at the near side, it's quite relatively smooth.
*23:45.700- 23:48.280* :  We have these regions, these dark regions,
*23:48.280- 23:52.240* :  which we call Mary, which are roughly translates to seas.
*23:52.240- 23:55.020* :  They're not seas of water, they're seas of rock, lava.
*23:55.820- 23:56.900* :  But they're relatively smooth.
*23:56.900- 23:59.880* :  If you go to the far side, it's very much more rugged.
*24:00.200- 24:01.800* :  This is the great moon dichotomy.
*24:02.040- 24:04.380* :  We need the rocks on the far side to understand
*24:04.380- 24:06.460* :  the full history of the moon.
*24:06.580- 24:07.760* :  Where does the moon come from?
*24:07.880- 24:09.820* :  Why is it stuck in this position?
*24:09.820- 24:13.660* :  Is it goes around earth where it only presents one side to us?
*24:13.680- 24:16.220* :  We think it's because there was a collision
*24:16.220- 24:20.020* :  early in the solar system between the earth and a mass-sized body.
*24:20.020- 24:20.960* :  They came together.
*24:21.520- 24:25.040* :  It left this lump of stuff in orbit around the moon
*24:25.040- 24:27.500* :  and that is what we see up in the sky today.
*24:27.660- 24:30.080* :  As you say, it's an extraordinary thing that they've done
*24:30.080- 24:33.060* :  to go to the far side of the moon, go down, come back again
*24:33.460- 24:34.180* :  with the samples.
*24:34.180- 24:38.720* :  Presumably, this is quite encouraging for future exploration.
*24:39.340- 24:40.100* :  Oh, absolutely.
*24:40.100- 24:43.660* :  Just to wonder how difficult it is to do what they've done
*24:44.480- 24:46.500* :  because it's on the far side.
*24:46.820- 24:49.240* :  You can't do direct radio communication.
*24:49.240- 24:52.240* :  You need a satellite in orbit around the moon
*24:52.240- 24:55.640* :  to relay communications from your spacecraft on the surface
*24:56.540- 24:59.100* :  up to lunar orbit and then back to the earth.
*24:59.140- 25:00.200* :  So it is very difficult.
*25:00.980- 25:04.280* :  But think about the architecture of the Chenghi Six Mission
*25:04.520- 25:06.960* :  and indeed Chenghi Five, which was identical,
*25:06.960- 25:08.580* :  but only went to the near side.
*25:09.220- 25:11.240* :  If you can put yourself down on the moon,
*25:11.840- 25:16.640* :  do things, lift yourself back off, reconnect with an orbiting
*25:16.640- 25:20.080* :  spacecraft, the thing that brought you to the moon
*25:20.080- 25:22.160* :  in the first place, and then head home.
*25:22.160- 25:23.220* :  What else can you do that?
*25:23.840- 25:25.100* :  You don't have to do it with rocks.
*25:25.100- 25:26.400* :  You can do it with people.
*25:27.040- 25:30.280* :  And it's clear now that China is developing the technology
*25:30.280- 25:33.240* :  to be able to put astronauts on the moon.
*25:33.240- 25:35.720* :  What, a lunar base in our lifetime?
*25:36.340- 25:37.160* :  Very definitely.
*25:37.520- 25:39.940* :  They have talked about this, about having
*25:39.940- 25:41.320* :  their own research station.
*25:41.320- 25:46.100* :  There is really now a bit of a moon race, again,
*25:46.100- 25:49.000* :  like we had back in the late 60s and early 70s
*25:49.580- 25:51.020* :  with the Americans and the Soviets.
*25:51.620- 25:53.460* :  The Americans now determined to go back
*25:53.460- 25:54.740* :  before the end of this decade.
*25:54.740- 25:59.120* :  And China said itself of the target of 2030, as well,
*25:59.120- 26:01.760* :  to get their astronauts on the surface of the moon.
*26:02.000- 26:04.920* :  So it's going to be fascinating to see how that develops.
*26:05.480- 26:08.400* :  And what you've observed with the Chenghi Six Mission
*26:08.940- 26:10.960* :  is them developing the technology to do that.
*26:11.640- 26:12.800* :  Jonathan Amos.
*26:13.740- 26:16.880* :  To football now, Austria have topped their group
*26:16.880- 26:19.920* :  and reached the final 16 in the European Championships
*26:20.000- 26:23.440* :  with a surprise three-two win over the Netherlands.
*26:23.920- 26:26.560* :  Fans spilled out into the streets of Berlin
*26:26.880- 26:27.900* :  to celebrate the win.
*26:28.300- 26:33.540* :  For my son, my life, it is so true, so true.
*26:36.120- 26:38.540* :  But it wasn't such good news for everyone.
*26:38.540- 26:40.960* :  We're playing in the Eros on Tuesday evening,
*26:40.960- 26:44.600* :  as our sports reporter, Nigel Adaly, told me.
*26:45.120- 26:48.100* :  Yes, I was unfortunate enough to be covering Denmark
*26:48.100- 26:51.160* :  against Serbia this evening, a match which was played in Munich.
*26:51.740- 26:53.440* :  And it finished as a nil-nil draw,
*26:53.440- 26:55.720* :  and it was an awful game.
*26:56.340- 26:58.780* :  But the point was very important for Denmark,
*26:58.780- 27:03.280* :  because it means they finished second behind England in Group C.
*27:03.740- 27:07.860* :  Serbia had to win that game, but they failed to create anything
*27:07.860- 27:10.320* :  really, despite having so many attacking players
*27:10.320- 27:11.860* :  on the field by the end of the match.
*27:12.240- 27:13.560* :  So they will go home early.
*27:14.060- 27:17.520* :  But Slovenia also drew nil-nil with England
*27:17.520- 27:20.060* :  and the other group, the other game in this group,
*27:20.500- 27:21.720* :  in Cologne this evening.
*27:21.720- 27:24.360* :  And that's a real milestone for Slovenia,
*27:24.360- 27:27.140* :  because they will qualify for the round of 16
*27:27.620- 27:29.240* :  as one of the third-place teams.
*27:29.680- 27:32.040* :  England winning the group, but once again,
*27:32.040- 27:34.180* :  it was a rather turgid performance from them,
*27:34.700- 27:36.580* :  and one which will pose more questions
*27:36.580- 27:39.500* :  and answers for their passionate football nation.
*27:40.000- 27:44.980* :  But France, well through, and Kylian and Bappe scored
*27:44.980- 27:47.300* :  for the first time in his career in the Ures.
*27:48.140- 27:51.000* :  He did, but there was also a surprise in Group D.
*27:51.000- 27:52.520* :  France were playing Poland,
*27:52.580- 27:55.320* :  who have already been eliminated from the competition,
*27:55.320- 27:57.320* :  and Bappe did score his first goal
*27:57.780- 28:00.280* :  in a European championships from the penalty spot,
*28:00.780- 28:03.060* :  but Robert Lewandowski, the veteran pole,
*28:03.560- 28:05.680* :  scored what could be his final goal
*28:06.040- 28:07.940* :  at a major tournament, also, with a penalty
*28:07.940- 28:09.500* :  to equalize for Poland.
*28:10.220- 28:12.760* :  And that allowed Austria to win the group,
*28:12.760- 28:14.540* :  because they won a dramatic match
*28:14.900- 28:17.140* :  with the Netherlands in Berlin, three, two.
*28:17.700- 28:19.860* :  And everybody it seemed before the tournament
*28:19.860- 28:22.380* :  was predicting that the French and the Dutch
*28:22.760- 28:23.760* :  would dominate the group,
*28:24.180- 28:26.140* :  but Austria have gone through as Group winners,
*28:26.840- 28:29.460* :  and the French will go through as runners up,
*28:29.460- 28:31.800* :  and the Netherlands will also go through
*28:31.800- 28:34.920* :  like Slovenia as one of the best third-place teams,
*28:35.340- 28:37.840* :  and there was a possibility they could now meet England
*28:38.380- 28:40.160* :  in the round of 16, which I'm sure,
*28:40.820- 28:43.360* :  would be a tie that neither nation would want at this stage.
*28:43.600- 28:47.300* :  So where does this leave us in the next stage of years?
*28:47.300- 28:48.640* :  Who are the favorites now?
*28:50.060- 28:52.680* :  Well, Germany, the host nation started very strongly,
*28:52.680- 28:55.200* :  but they had to ease through with the draw against Switzerland.
*28:55.200- 28:58.020* :  They will meet Denmark in the round of 16.
*28:58.620- 29:00.580* :  Spain have gone through with maximum points.
*29:01.160- 29:02.140* :  They've looked very good,
*29:02.780- 29:05.000* :  so far Portugal have the opportunity
*29:05.000- 29:07.440* :  to also go through with three victories
*29:07.440- 29:10.120* :  when they meet Georgia in their final game.
*29:10.520- 29:12.400* :  But for a number of major nations,
*29:12.400- 29:15.360* :  like the French, the Dutch, and the English,
*29:15.360- 29:17.920* :  and also the Italians who went through
*29:17.920- 29:21.340* :  in the closing seconds of their game against Croatia last night,
*29:21.900- 29:23.680* :  they do appear to be sides at the moment
*29:23.700- 29:26.060* :  who are yet to find their top form.
*29:26.420- 29:27.620* :  And now it's knockout football,
*29:27.660- 29:29.600* :  there really is no margin for error.
*29:30.420- 29:31.540* :  Nigel Adely.
*29:32.600- 29:35.280* :  Scientists in Japan have found a new way
*29:35.280- 29:40.580* :  to attach modified human skin to complex humanoid robot surfaces.
*29:40.980- 29:43.540* :  Julian Marshall spoke to Chris Dorsey,
*29:43.540- 29:45.680* :  an associate professor at the Institute
*29:45.680- 29:49.780* :  for Experiential Robotics at Northeastern University in Boston
*29:50.280- 29:50.840* :  in the US.
*29:50.840- 29:53.100* :  So what exactly did they do?
*29:53.740- 29:57.760* :  So you might want to put skin on a robot face
*29:57.880- 29:58.980* :  to make it look realistic.
*29:59.620- 30:01.220* :  The skin is very soft and stretchable,
*30:01.640- 30:05.840* :  but the underlying robot face is very hard material.
*30:06.460- 30:09.240* :  It makes it really hard to get a three-dimensional shape.
*30:09.940- 30:12.900* :  So what they've done is make these anchors
*30:13.500- 30:18.080* :  between the skin and the robot that mimic human skin.
*30:18.240- 30:21.260* :  So it is very similar to the skin ligaments
*30:21.360- 30:23.620* :  that go between the skin of our face
*30:23.820- 30:25.000* :  and the muscles underneath.
*30:25.500- 30:27.880* :  And this is quite exciting because their approach
*30:27.920- 30:31.200* :  might make the skin more durable and long-lasting over time.
*30:31.760- 30:33.080* :  Is it live skin?
*30:33.720- 30:36.620* :  It is live skin cells, yes, mixed in with collagen.
*30:37.020- 30:38.980* :  And how long does it stay alive?
*30:40.100- 30:43.160* :  So that's not something they addressed directly in the paper,
*30:43.360- 30:45.040* :  but what they did demonstrate was
*30:45.300- 30:49.120* :  culturing the collagen in the skin cells over a week.
*30:49.680- 30:53.180* :  Is keeping the skin alive the main challenge at the moment?
*30:53.880- 30:55.580* :  I think that's a rather large challenge.
*30:55.620- 30:58.040* :  So one of the things that the scientists in this work
*30:58.040- 31:01.280* :  have not done is investigate blood vessels
*31:01.280- 31:04.800* :  and lymphatic vessels that would help transport nutrients
*31:04.800- 31:06.480* :  in oxygen to the skin cells
*31:06.480- 31:08.060* :  and also transport them away.
*31:09.000- 31:10.360* :  Are there any particular advantages
*31:10.360- 31:15.420* :  to using modified human skin rather than synthetic skin
*31:15.420- 31:16.840* :  for humanoid robots?
*31:18.100- 31:19.800* :  Yes, there are a couple of advantages.
*31:19.800- 31:23.380* :  So one is that skin has self-healing properties.
*31:24.080- 31:26.420* :  So if we have a robot that's out in the world
*31:26.440- 31:28.200* :  and it scrapes or cuts itself,
*31:28.200- 31:32.060* :  it could heal rather than needing to apply new material.
*31:32.800- 31:36.620* :  Another is that skin has touch sensors and temperature
*31:36.620- 31:38.540* :  sensors already embedded within it
*31:38.960- 31:42.660* :  and may also be able to do things like help the robot sweat
*31:42.660- 31:45.720* :  to cool off, which means that the robot itself
*31:45.720- 31:47.520* :  could do more work.
*31:48.160- 31:49.520* :  Is there something of a competition
*31:49.520- 31:54.080* :  to see whether synthetic or real skin
*31:54.220- 31:58.460* :  will win out or are there different uses for each?
*31:59.180- 32:00.300* :  It's a bit of a competition
*32:00.380- 32:02.920* :  between different research groups for sure,
*32:02.920- 32:06.140* :  but also I see synthetic skin
*32:06.140- 32:08.620* :  without any biological components as well
*32:08.620- 32:11.700* :  as engineered skin with skin cells in it
*32:11.720- 32:12.900* :  as having different purposes.
*32:13.680- 32:16.740* :  Maybe we would want to use a self-healing material
*32:17.400- 32:20.760* :  for a robot that will go out and do something for a few days,
*32:21.720- 32:24.220* :  but we might want a robot that looks really realistic
*32:24.620- 32:26.680* :  or that will last for a really long time
*32:27.220- 32:30.340* :  to have the self-regeneration and self-healing properties
*32:30.980- 32:31.760* :  of human skin.
*32:33.020- 32:37.540* :  Is this a procedure that's only applicable to humanoid robots
*32:37.540- 32:40.040* :  or could it have any use for humans as well?
*32:40.560- 32:42.840* :  One of the things in the paper that I thought was really
*32:42.840- 32:45.980* :  interesting is they proposed to use the skin
*32:45.980- 32:48.020* :  that they had engineered to understand
*32:48.020- 32:49.580* :  wrinkle formation in humans.
*32:50.120- 32:52.140* :  It could also have lots of potential uses
*32:52.140- 32:53.960* :  for things like prosthetic devices,
*32:54.880- 32:57.080* :  which would interface with your own skin.
*32:57.920- 33:00.140* :  Chris Dorsey from the Institute
*33:00.140- 33:03.900* :  for Experiential Robotics at Northeastern University
*33:03.900- 33:06.100* :  in Boston in the US.
*33:09.460- 33:11.760* :  And that's all from us for now,
*33:11.760- 33:15.060* :  but there'll be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
*33:15.060- 33:17.460* :  If you want to comment on this podcast
*33:17.460- 33:21.180* :  or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*33:21.600- 33:26.220* :  The address is globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk.
*33:26.300- 33:30.820* :  You can also find us on X at Global NewsPod.
*33:31.320- 33:34.040* :  This addition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll.
*33:34.520- 33:37.160* :  The producer was Liam McChaeffrey.
*33:37.700- 33:39.640* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*33:39.940- 33:41.640* :  I'm Alex Ritzon until next time.
*33:42.260- 33:42.580* :  Goodbye.
*33:47.780- 33:50.340* :  Hi, I'm Daniel, founder of PrettyLitter.
*33:50.880- 33:52.620* :  Cats and cat owners deserve better than any old fashion litter.
*33:53.040- 33:55.340* :  That's why I teamed up with scientists and veterinarians
*33:55.340- 33:55.960* :  to create PrettyLitter.
*34:00.100- 34:00.480* :  Its innovative crystal formula has superior odor control
*34:01.660- 34:02.340* :  and weighs up to 80% less than clay litter.
*34:02.980- 34:04.560* :  PrettyLitter even monitors health by changing colors
*34:05.680- 34:07.720* :  to help detect early signs of potential illness.
*34:07.720- 34:09.000* :  It's the world's smartest kitty litter.
