*00:16.980- 00:20.940* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:21.220- 00:23.600* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.920- 00:27.520* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*00:27.560- 00:31.320* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.580- 00:36.600* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*00:46.300- 00:47.020* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:47.020- 00:53.040* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if Big Wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*00:53.100- 00:54.100* :  They said yes.
*00:54.140- 00:58.520* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts,
*00:58.520- 01:00.880* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*01:00.920- 01:02.480* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*01:02.760- 01:08.060* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:19.440- 01:22.120* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.520- 01:27.320* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 27th of June,
*01:27.760- 01:28.820* :  these are our main stories.
*01:29.220- 01:32.120* :  The BBC speaks to a people smuggler,
*01:32.520- 01:36.200* :  organising illegal boat crossings between France and the UK.
*01:37.040- 01:42.120* :  Bolivia's opposition says the attempted military coup on Wednesday was staged by the president,
*01:42.760- 01:46.740* :  and Denmark introduces the world's first tax on cows.
*01:48.980- 01:49.800* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:49.820- 01:52.200* :  talk about a nothing burger.
*01:52.420- 01:55.400* :  He would just be a vanilla.
*01:57.020- 01:59.220* :  Just a vanilla old rich guy.
*01:59.840- 02:03.880* :  Those jostling for position to be chosen as Donald Trump's running mate.
*02:07.480- 02:12.760* :  Thousands of migrants drown every year when their vessels capsize and sink,
*02:12.800- 02:16.220* :  particularly in places like the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic.
*02:16.840- 02:20.240* :  Well, the network of sea routes is spreading because there's growing demand
*02:20.240- 02:24.500* :  and more people realise they can make money out of providing the service.
*02:25.200- 02:27.020* :  Those are the people smugglers,
*02:27.200- 02:30.660* :  and they've developed a hugely profitable business in the English Channel.
*02:31.140- 02:34.220* :  That's the narrow stretch of water between France and the UK.
*02:34.840- 02:38.600* :  Large numbers of migrants are crowded on to small inflatable boats
*02:38.600- 02:40.800* :  that are often barely above the waterline.
*02:41.360- 02:46.020* :  The BBC has tracked down and confronted a people smuggler thought to be responsible
*02:46.020- 02:51.160* :  for organising a boat crossing in April, in which a seven-year-old girl died.
*02:51.900- 02:54.800* :  Our Paris correspondent Andrew Harding was on the beach in France
*02:54.800- 02:56.420* :  during that initial incident,
*02:56.860- 03:00.440* :  and in a lengthy investigation pursued the smuggler across Europe.
*03:01.300- 03:03.760* :  Excuse me, sir. Andrew Harding from BBC News.
*03:04.520- 03:07.300* :  I'm running through a public square in Luxembourg.
*03:07.300- 03:10.420* :  To confront a man we've been chasing across Europe.
*03:10.720- 03:12.860* :  We know who you are. You're a smuggler, you know?
*03:13.400- 03:16.900* :  We know he's responsible for putting hundreds of people in small boats,
*03:17.260- 03:18.580* :  heading from France to England.
*03:20.680- 03:22.920* :  And responsible for one boat in particular.
*03:26.140- 03:29.220* :  It was back in April before dawn on a beach in Northern France.
*03:29.980- 03:33.180* :  We witnessed police battling with a group of smugglers
*03:33.500- 03:38.140* :  and chaos as two groups of people charged onto a small boat, heading for the UK.
*03:39.100- 03:43.860* :  Then we saw a girl in a pink coat being carried on board
*03:44.180- 03:46.660* :  and later disappearing into the scrum.
*03:47.900- 03:49.340* :  She suffocated soon afterwards.
*03:49.800- 03:51.740* :  Four others on the boat also died.
*03:53.320- 03:55.700* :  The girl's name was Sarah, seven-years-old,
*03:56.100- 03:58.100* :  born in Belgium, raised in Sweden.
*04:01.300- 04:04.220* :  A few days later, still in the French port of Wimera,
*04:04.220- 04:10.240* :  we found her father Ahmed, an Iraqi man, consumed by grief and also by guilt.
*04:15.120- 04:18.080* :  But one of those who actually organized the family's trip,
*04:18.220- 04:22.520* :  not the foot soldiers on the beaches, but the generals working behind the scenes.
*04:23.360- 04:28.420* :  We hear the man who arranged Sarah's deadly journey is still active,
*04:28.420- 04:32.200* :  still smuggling. To find him, we have to leave France.
*04:34.820- 04:38.420* :  Three sources who for all dealt directly with the same smuggling boss
*04:39.080- 04:42.780* :  have told us, confidentially, that we'll find our smuggler
*04:43.000- 04:44.460* :  in the Belgian city of Antwerp.
*04:44.460- 04:46.220* :  So that's where we're heading now.
*04:46.520- 04:48.760* :  Our plan is for one of our team,
*04:49.240- 04:52.060* :  we're calling him Mahmoud to protect his identity,
*04:52.620- 04:54.520* :  to pose as a migrant.
*04:56.940- 04:59.680* :  We are now waiting for the smuggler to call us.
*05:00.820- 05:02.880* :  He's just sent us a text message.
*05:03.600- 05:05.020* :  So it could be any moment now.
*05:07.420- 05:09.860* :  Believing he's talking to a potential client,
*05:09.940- 05:12.860* :  he offers Mahmoud a seat on his next boat.
*05:14.480- 05:16.840* :  You want to get to Britain? Are you ready or not?
*05:17.600- 05:19.700* :  How many seats do you need? It's safe.
*05:20.100- 05:21.380* :  100%.
*05:22.820- 05:27.180* :  It is crucial confirmation that the smuggler is still in business.
*05:27.940- 05:31.160* :  Separately, a source has provided us with more information,
*05:31.160- 05:34.220* :  signatures of the smuggler and his identity papers.
*05:34.820- 05:37.780* :  His name is Rebois, 39 years old,
*05:38.000- 05:39.360* :  with an Iraqi passport.
*05:41.460- 05:44.040* :  So it turns out he's not in Belgium anymore.
*05:45.540- 05:48.280* :  Worried about being arrested, he's on the run.
*05:50.100- 05:50.960* :  And we're in pursuit.
*05:54.120- 05:57.020* :  Screen grabs and videos sent to us from the smuggler's phone
*05:57.020- 05:59.660* :  indicate that he's in some sort of camp,
*05:59.700- 06:03.060* :  which we've matched online to a migrant
*06:03.060- 06:07.260* :  and asylum-seeker reception center in Luxembourg.
*06:07.740- 06:09.140* :  So he's answering the phone.
*06:09.420- 06:10.720* :  We know that this is you, sir.
*06:11.560- 06:13.760* :  We know 100% that you are a smuggler.
*06:14.040- 06:16.140* :  But you're responsible for the death of this 71.
*06:16.140- 06:18.280* :  But you put her on a boat.
*06:18.860- 06:20.520* :  You took money from her parents.
*06:20.520- 06:22.800* :  That she and four other people died.
*06:24.240- 06:24.620* :  That's you.
*06:24.940- 06:26.300* :  We know this is our man.
*06:26.660- 06:27.680* :  He's getting on a tram now.
*06:27.680- 06:28.600* :  We're going to let him go.
*06:28.600- 06:30.580* :  There's not much more we can do.
*06:32.500- 06:34.640* :  As for the family Sarah left behind,
*06:34.780- 06:38.520* :  they're being housed temporarily in a small village in France.
*06:39.240- 06:41.560* :  But this grieving family has no permission
*06:41.560- 06:43.900* :  to settle anywhere in Europe.
*06:44.780- 06:46.700* :  Instead they wait in limbo,
*06:47.120- 06:49.440* :  while the smuggling industry thrives.
*06:50.640- 06:53.440* :  Andrew Harding on the trail of people smugglers.
*06:54.680- 06:57.380* :  To Bolivia now, a nation with a long history
*06:57.380- 06:59.140* :  of political instability.
*06:59.140- 07:03.040* :  There have been 190 or so coups since independence.
*07:03.560- 07:05.880* :  That's an average of nearly one a year.
*07:06.380- 07:10.220* :  After the latest attempt or irregular mobilization of troops
*07:10.240- 07:11.580* :  as the government put it,
*07:12.100- 07:14.260* :  the Defence Minister says the government is now back
*07:14.340- 07:16.520* :  in total control of the armed forces.
*07:17.160- 07:20.140* :  The former armed forces commander, General Juan Jos√©
*07:20.140- 07:24.240* :  Zuniga, is now in custody after deploying hundreds of soldiers
*07:24.240- 07:27.380* :  and armed vehicles in the centre of the main city, La Paz.
*07:27.940- 07:30.220* :  Speaking after order was restored,
*07:30.220- 07:34.060* :  the president, Luis Arce, thanked Bolivians for their loyalty.
*07:34.920- 07:38.160* :  Un querido sorprendernos,
*07:38.160- 07:40.380* :  is unprenderno Pablo Boliviano.
*07:40.380- 07:43.540* :  They wanted to surprise us and the Bolivian people.
*07:44.340- 07:45.120* :  We have reacted,
*07:45.560- 07:48.760* :  and also the people have mobilized against this coup attempt.
*07:49.700- 07:51.160* :  Thanks to the Bolivian people.
*07:53.780- 07:55.540* :  But the opposition in Bolivia
*07:55.540- 07:57.540* :  has already called this a self coup,
*07:57.540- 07:59.800* :  a staged, managed fake coup.
*08:00.220- 08:03.000* :  Their leg was organised by President Arce.
*08:03.920- 08:06.600* :  Andrea Barrientos is an opposition senator.
*08:06.600- 08:08.720* :  She spoke to us from the city of Cochabamba.
*08:09.260- 08:10.400* :  What happened today in Bolivia?
*08:10.400- 08:12.680* :  It's a really bizarre situation.
*08:12.940- 08:15.840* :  I can say that we can affirm that it was a self-coup organised
*08:16.400- 08:17.820* :  by Luis Arce's government.
*08:17.820- 08:20.180* :  Around 130 pm,
*08:20.180- 08:22.140* :  there was a lot of military.
*08:22.720- 08:24.580* :  And if you're going to have a coup,
*08:25.000- 08:26.340* :  you cannot have a minister,
*08:26.340- 08:29.060* :  a government minister that rules the police,
*08:29.060- 08:31.200* :  just walking around militaries.
*08:31.380- 08:33.240* :  Also, Su√±iga said later today
*08:33.700- 08:35.440* :  that it was a president order
*08:35.440- 08:38.440* :  that he was following to take the tanks to the palace.
*08:39.280- 08:42.520* :  I asked Anna Maria Rura from BBC Mundo.
*08:43.100- 08:44.380* :  What seems to have been going on?
*08:45.080- 08:47.540* :  Well, at this moment, everything is very confusing.
*08:48.000- 08:49.920* :  What we can confirm is that
*08:50.580- 08:52.620* :  we know that General Juan Jos√© Su√±iga
*08:52.940- 08:54.720* :  was one of the closest persons
*08:55.400- 08:57.740* :  in the army to the president, Luis Arce.
*08:58.180- 09:00.780* :  But he is now responsible for this attempt of coup d'etat
*09:01.060- 09:02.660* :  and he's investigated at leading
*09:03.100- 09:07.320* :  this very, we can say, fast and confusing, coattent.
*09:07.900- 09:10.720* :  Right after a small faction of the army
*09:10.720- 09:12.180* :  that was led by him
*09:12.580- 09:15.720* :  was trying to get inside of the former presidential palace,
*09:15.720- 09:16.840* :  the Palacio que Mado,
*09:17.240- 09:20.460* :  he said that he was trying to restructure democracy
*09:20.840- 09:21.440* :  in the country.
*09:22.040- 09:24.640* :  We also know that Su√±iga had been dismissed
*09:24.640- 09:27.540* :  ahead of the Bolivian Army on Tuesday
*09:28.280- 09:30.500* :  for threatening statements against
*09:30.500- 09:33.000* :  the former president, Ebo Morales.
*09:33.660- 09:35.180* :  And after his arrest,
*09:35.600- 09:38.620* :  we heard that the general saying to the press
*09:38.620- 09:42.180* :  he had a meeting with the president Arce on Sunday.
*09:42.600- 09:44.140* :  And I quote, he said,
*09:44.140- 09:47.060* :  the president told me that the situation was bad
*09:47.540- 09:49.400* :  and this week would be critical.
*09:49.800- 09:51.740* :  Then it was needed to prepare something
*09:51.740- 09:53.640* :  to push up his popularity.
*09:54.220- 09:55.720* :  And I asked him, he said,
*09:56.060- 09:58.380* :  shall we take the armored vehicles out
*09:58.740- 10:00.840* :  and he said, take them out.
*10:00.960- 10:04.880* :  That was the statement of the General Su√±iga.
*10:05.180- 10:07.540* :  So just to clarify, what the opposition is saying
*10:07.540- 10:10.060* :  that this was orchestrated by the government,
*10:10.100- 10:13.200* :  there is no credibility behind that as far as you can see.
*10:13.520- 10:15.540* :  We have two versions of what happened
*10:15.880- 10:17.480* :  and now everything is very confusing.
*10:17.480- 10:20.000* :  We cannot confirm any of the two versions.
*10:20.720- 10:22.580* :  So how does this leave Mr. Arce now?
*10:22.580- 10:24.640* :  Is he strengthened or weakened by this?
*10:25.080- 10:27.780* :  Well, we can say that after this episode,
*10:27.780- 10:29.880* :  his popularity has boosted.
*10:29.900- 10:31.880* :  And let's remember that he was leaving
*10:32.540- 10:33.840* :  a very profound crisis,
*10:33.840- 10:34.860* :  an economic crisis,
*10:34.860- 10:37.360* :  and also an internal political crisis.
*10:37.820- 10:41.880* :  But we have seen also yesterday how thousands of people
*10:41.920- 10:46.600* :  just went in front of the presidential palace
*10:47.020- 10:48.880* :  to defend democracy they say
*10:48.880- 10:52.120* :  and to reject this attempt of Kudeta.
*10:52.680- 10:55.240* :  Ana Maria Rura from BBC Mundo.
*10:55.520- 10:56.440* :  In a matter of hours,
*10:56.860- 10:59.520* :  the rematch will start as Joe Biden
*10:59.520- 11:01.500* :  and Donald Trump go head-to-head
*11:01.640- 11:03.380* :  in their first election debate.
*11:04.040- 11:07.500* :  The two men, who have a combined age of 159,
*11:07.700- 11:11.100* :  are the candidates to compete for America's top job.
*11:11.880- 11:14.540* :  But one thing that still remains a bit of a mystery
*11:14.540- 11:18.200* :  is who Donald Trump would pick as his running mate.
*11:18.840- 11:20.400* :  Our correspondent, Netta Tulfik,
*11:20.520- 11:22.040* :  takes a look at the top contenders.
*11:23.180- 11:26.200* :  We need Donald Trump!
*11:26.200- 11:30.160* :  Donald J. Trump will make America great again.
*11:30.440- 11:33.860* :  In what feels like the VP edition of the Apprentice,
*11:34.040- 11:35.780* :  there's no shortage of contenders
*11:35.780- 11:38.240* :  vying to be Donald Trump's running mate.
*11:38.920- 11:40.300* :  Among the reported shortlist,
*11:40.600- 11:44.300* :  a governor from the fourth least populist state of North Dakota,
*11:44.900- 11:46.820* :  a Black Southern Republican senator,
*11:47.420- 11:49.720* :  a Cuban American senator from Florida,
*11:50.360- 11:53.500* :  a Trump country so-called intellectual populist,
*11:53.800- 11:56.180* :  and a millennial congresswoman from New York.
*11:56.700- 11:58.300* :  Given his pension for drama,
*11:58.300- 12:02.160* :  I think his preference really is to keep people guessing.
*12:02.380- 12:04.480* :  Senator Kevin Kramer of North Dakota
*12:04.880- 12:07.100* :  believes it's highly likely Trump will pick
*12:07.100- 12:09.720* :  the governor of his state, Doug Burgham.
*12:10.160- 12:12.080* :  Who are we going to send back to the White House?
*12:14.260- 12:14.280* :  Trump!
*12:14.280- 12:17.560* :  Like Trump, he entered politics in 2016 as a businessman.
*12:18.120- 12:20.080* :  The wealthy governor made his fortune
*12:20.080- 12:21.980* :  by mortgaging his family's farm
*12:21.980- 12:24.040* :  to invest in a software company
*12:24.040- 12:27.040* :  which he later took public and sold to Microsoft
*12:27.040- 12:30.160* :  for 1.1 billion in 2001.
*12:30.160- 12:32.140* :  He brings a stability,
*12:32.700- 12:35.400* :  brings a knowledge of how to run a corporation,
*12:35.400- 12:37.480* :  how to run a family farm,
*12:37.480- 12:38.700* :  how to run a grain elevator.
*12:39.180- 12:40.700* :  And I do think Doug's governing
*12:40.720- 12:42.760* :  of the energy boom in North Dakota
*12:43.240- 12:45.880* :  is very appealing to Donald Trump into his message.
*12:45.880- 12:48.560* :  And I do think that Doug Burgham balances
*12:49.200- 12:50.820* :  some of the more impulse, if you will,
*12:51.660- 12:53.760* :  and the big personality of Donald Trump.
*12:54.060- 12:54.880* :  So get ready for something.
*12:54.960- 12:55.900* :  Okay, just get ready.
*12:55.900- 12:58.220* :  But Doug Burgham has been incredible.
*12:58.920- 13:00.720* :  Myra Adams, a former Republican
*13:00.720- 13:02.720* :  and an op-ed writer for the U.S.
*13:02.720- 13:04.160* :  political website The Hill,
*13:04.480- 13:07.500* :  also believes Burgham is the favorite to take it.
*13:08.080- 13:10.700* :  Despite running in the Republican presidential primary,
*13:10.700- 13:14.360* :  Governor Burgham doesn't have much of a national profile.
*13:15.100- 13:16.880* :  She is betting that Trump wants someone,
*13:16.880- 13:19.840* :  photogenic, who will staunchly defend him,
*13:20.320- 13:21.880* :  but who will not, outshine him.
*13:22.220- 13:23.880* :  Talk about a nothing burger.
*13:23.900- 13:26.960* :  My little town has more people than North Dakota.
*13:27.400- 13:31.160* :  But he doesn't present any kind of problem.
*13:31.640- 13:34.600* :  He would just be a vanilla.
*13:35.060- 13:38.340* :  Just a vanilla old rich guy.
*13:38.960- 13:40.800* :  If Trump is more focused on a VP
*13:40.820- 13:42.780* :  who could bring in additional votes,
*13:43.380- 13:44.820* :  Myra is among those who say
*13:44.820- 13:46.760* :  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida
*13:47.080- 13:47.840* :  is the better choice.
*13:51.320- 13:52.560* :  He speaks Spanish.
*13:53.340- 13:54.240* :  And that is so key.
*13:54.240- 13:55.480* :  I can't emphasize that enough.
*13:55.740- 13:57.060* :  This will be the first election
*13:57.680- 14:00.020* :  where the Hispanic vote is projected
*14:00.820- 14:03.540* :  to be larger than the Black vote.
*14:04.120- 14:07.580* :  Biden won 67% of Hispanic Catholics
*14:08.200- 14:10.500* :  compared to 32% for Trump.
*14:10.960- 14:13.340* :  Rubio could really help with Hispanic Catholics.
*14:14.280- 14:15.500* :  Plus Rubio is very experienced.
*14:15.580- 14:17.680* :  He's Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
*14:18.100- 14:19.740* :  But I don't think Trump trusts him.
*14:21.020- 14:22.740* :  I think Trump believes that Rubio
*14:22.740- 14:24.220* :  is just looking to be president.
*14:25.040- 14:26.840* :  Considered up with Burgham and Rubio
*14:26.840- 14:29.420* :  in the top three is the new Ohio Senator,
*14:29.720- 14:30.500* :  JD Vance.
*14:30.620- 14:33.800* :  Let's rebuild prosperity for America's citizens
*14:34.380- 14:35.800* :  and reelect Donald J. Trump.
*14:36.140- 14:38.800* :  He once wondered whether Trump was America's Hitler
*14:38.800- 14:41.780* :  but is now close to Trump's son, Don Jr.
*14:42.540- 14:45.460* :  He is seen by some as more useful in Congress
*14:45.820- 14:48.020* :  and unlikely to add much to the ticket.
*14:49.040- 14:50.320* :  And what about a running mate
*14:50.320- 14:52.320* :  that could help with key demographic groups
*14:52.420- 14:53.460* :  that lean Democrat?
*14:53.460- 14:58.140* :  Here's senior advisor to the Trump 2016 campaign, Dave Urban.
*14:58.640- 15:00.320* :  Do you think women
*15:01.620- 15:03.380* :  who may be suspect of Donald Trump
*15:03.380- 15:05.800* :  would somehow overcome their suspicion
*15:05.980- 15:08.840* :  and be overcome by having just a woman on the ticket?
*15:09.260- 15:11.120* :  And the same goes for having an African-American on the ticket.
*15:11.660- 15:13.180* :  Again, wouldn't it be the ultimate irony
*15:13.180- 15:15.660* :  that if the vice president were picked somebody not on the list?
*15:16.080- 15:17.740* :  Wouldn't that be the ultimate showmanship?
*15:18.200- 15:20.660* :  Whoever it is would not only be a heartbeat away
*15:20.660- 15:22.680* :  from the presidency should Trump win
*15:22.680- 15:25.740* :  but potentially the future leader of the party
*15:25.740- 15:27.000* :  for years to come.
*15:27.720- 15:28.520* :  Neutrophic.
*15:29.960- 15:31.220* :  Earlier on in the podcast,
*15:31.420- 15:33.660* :  we heard about that people smuggler.
*15:33.880- 15:35.480* :  Well, now authorities have uncovered
*15:35.480- 15:38.540* :  some particularly inventive and damaging new tactics
*15:39.300- 15:41.660* :  employed by international animal smugglers.
*15:41.720- 15:43.820* :  These include sending endangered frogs
*15:43.820- 15:46.780* :  by post and trafficking rhino horns
*15:47.320- 15:48.600* :  by grinding them into a paste.
*15:49.120- 15:51.760* :  Our environment correspondent, Navin Singh Kadke, tell me more.
*15:52.280- 15:54.700* :  So see, for example, just last March,
*15:54.700- 15:56.920* :  authorities in Vietnam, for instance,
*15:56.920- 15:59.660* :  for the first time they caught a shipment,
*16:00.460- 16:02.880* :  which was covered by something painted black
*16:03.580- 16:05.440* :  and there was a cover load of cowhorns.
*16:06.160- 16:07.680* :  But then upon close examination,
*16:07.680- 16:11.480* :  they found that it was actually ivory's painted in black
*16:11.480- 16:13.260* :  and mixed up with cowhorns.
*16:13.940- 16:16.320* :  And they say, that was by chance, it happened.
*16:16.780- 16:18.780* :  And as you mentioned, postal services, you know,
*16:18.780- 16:22.520* :  courier services, all these toys stacked in the toys
*16:22.520- 16:25.040* :  first in within socks and then in thing.
*16:25.460- 16:26.320* :  And also interestingly,
*16:26.840- 16:28.720* :  some academic studies have also shown
*16:29.200- 16:31.800* :  that these traffickers are now using smell.
*16:32.320- 16:33.580* :  You know, like for example, spices
*16:34.280- 16:36.720* :  in certain contraband illegal wildlife goods
*16:37.140- 16:39.880* :  do foil the detection capacity of dogs,
*16:39.880- 16:41.360* :  neither dogs at airports.
*16:41.760- 16:44.620* :  For example, you know, you've got ivory's or rhino horns
*16:45.140- 16:46.040* :  or pangolin scales.
*16:46.560- 16:48.820* :  Recently there was a case where they caught one pangolin scale
*16:48.820- 16:52.140* :  a basket mixed up with mahogany seeds.
*16:52.860- 16:55.260* :  And the smell was the deterrence.
*16:55.500- 16:57.640* :  So this kind of thing and it's always evolving.
*16:57.780- 16:59.520* :  Yeah, as you say, always evolving.
*16:59.520- 17:02.640* :  They're constantly trying to keep one step ahead of the authorities.
*17:02.640- 17:04.580* :  The authorities are obviously forcing them
*17:04.940- 17:07.060* :  into using new tactics.
*17:07.800- 17:11.380* :  And their all successes aren't there in the fight against animal smugglers.
*17:11.600- 17:12.500* :  There are some successes.
*17:12.540- 17:14.800* :  That's why all these examples came into light.
*17:14.800- 17:16.080* :  Otherwise, we wouldn't have known them.
*17:16.340- 17:19.100* :  But the thing is what I'm being told by these different authorities is
*17:19.760- 17:24.040* :  resource is one thing that they do not have enough resource
*17:24.040- 17:25.140* :  or even training.
*17:25.640- 17:26.780* :  And then come to think of it,
*17:27.200- 17:31.220* :  one tactic what traffickers use is mix up legal and illegal goods.
*17:31.220- 17:32.160* :  For example, timber.
*17:32.540- 17:36.340* :  You see, there are two timber that allowed for legally, you know,
*17:36.340- 17:37.400* :  trading that's allowed.
*17:37.400- 17:40.240* :  But then what they do is they mix them up with illegal ones,
*17:40.240- 17:41.700* :  happening in Europe as well.
*17:42.220- 17:42.880* :  So what happens is,
*17:43.340- 17:46.220* :  imagine hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of containers,
*17:47.120- 17:50.300* :  airport officials tell me it's impossible to check all of them.
*17:50.420- 17:51.520* :  And that is a big task.
*17:51.920- 17:52.980* :  Navinsin Kakka.
*17:55.000- 17:55.500* :  Still to come.
*17:55.980- 17:58.100* :  Ultimately, this is something that, you know,
*17:58.100- 18:00.640* :  potentially is opening a door to saying
*18:00.640- 18:02.460* :  well, we're going to replace you forever.
*18:02.960- 18:06.620* :  The new AI tool that threatens to shake up the world of music.
*18:15.360- 18:16.580* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mint Mobile.
*18:16.900- 18:19.700* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation,
*18:20.060- 18:21.860* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*18:22.380- 18:24.880* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,
*18:24.880- 18:26.180* :  which is apparently a thing.

*19:24.300- 19:26.220* :  in Britain's general election.
*19:26.360- 19:29.880* :  They'll be doing so at a time of record levels of distrust
*19:29.880- 19:32.680* :  in both politicians and the system as a whole.
*19:33.360- 19:36.600* :  Although a lack of faith in politics is hardly unique to Britain,
*19:36.980- 19:38.080* :  among developed countries,
*19:38.080- 19:42.000* :  it appears to be even worse in the UK than in its European neighbours.
*19:42.620- 19:45.720* :  This report from our British political correspondent, Rob Watson.
*19:51.480- 19:55.440* :  Welcome to Hull, a once very prosperous port city in the northeast of England,
*19:55.900- 19:57.260* :  now more down on its luck,
*19:57.660- 20:01.880* :  and where in 2019 fewer than 50% of people bothered to vote
*20:02.360- 20:03.720* :  at the last general election,
*20:04.220- 20:06.520* :  the lowest turnout anywhere in Britain.
*20:07.040- 20:10.600* :  I've come to ask people what they think of politics and politicians.
*20:11.740- 20:13.200* :  Democracy stands as jerk.
*20:13.880- 20:17.000* :  It's a four year lottery between two parties,
*20:17.760- 20:19.320* :  and Parliament is a fast as well.
*20:19.900- 20:22.740* :  It's like old-fashioned Oxford debate in society.
*20:23.180- 20:24.640* :  It's just not fit for purpose anymore.
*20:25.180- 20:27.500* :  We all went through a Covid thinking that, you know,
*20:27.620- 20:30.320* :  we were doing the right thing and nobody could see loved ones
*20:30.360- 20:31.820* :  and things like that.
*20:32.620- 20:35.040* :  And they were blatantly doing what they wanted to do.
*20:36.060- 20:38.100* :  Sticks in Mathro are very much.
*20:38.920- 20:41.420* :  I think the role the most selfish bunch going,
*20:41.720- 20:44.240* :  whatever party you vote for, I don't trust any of them.
*20:45.140- 20:45.720* :  It's just corrupt.
*20:47.200- 20:49.800* :  Because there were wealthy end-to-dark hairballers
*20:50.520- 20:51.580* :  who were at the bottom of the pile.
*20:52.720- 20:55.680* :  Is there anything that politicians could do to, I don't know,
*20:55.680- 20:58.000* :  restore your trust and confidence?
*20:58.800- 21:01.260* :  Visit the area and try and live a life as a normal person.
*21:03.080- 21:05.860* :  So how typical are the residents of Hull and being fed up
*21:05.900- 21:07.920* :  and disillusioned with politics and politicians?
*21:08.540- 21:10.180* :  I'm with Sophie Stowers of the UK
*21:10.180- 21:12.600* :  and a changing Europe program at King's College London
*21:12.940- 21:15.380* :  and author of a recent paper on apathy in Britain
*21:15.380- 21:17.780* :  and how it compares to other European countries.
*21:17.900- 21:19.800* :  So Sophie, how typical is it?
*21:20.460- 21:21.620* :  I mean, we know it's very typical,
*21:22.240- 21:24.400* :  a majority of the public distrust politicians.
*21:25.300- 21:28.160* :  But also, there's also that doubt about just their fundamental ability
*21:28.160- 21:29.640* :  to do the job realistically.
*21:29.900- 21:32.860* :  Our voters just don't think politicians are very good to be blunt.
*21:33.340- 21:35.500* :  What interested in it is how that translates into turnout.
*21:35.820- 21:38.880* :  We know that certain groups are just simply less likely to turn out.
*21:38.880- 21:41.700* :  So we know that younger voters, people who have been to university,
*21:42.540- 21:43.800* :  people from more deprived backgrounds,
*21:43.800- 21:45.400* :  ethnic minority voters too,
*21:45.820- 21:47.840* :  are all less likely to actually turn out in the polls.
*21:48.120- 21:49.500* :  So even though the apathy is widespread,
*21:49.500- 21:52.180* :  it only affects turnout from more specific younger voters.
*21:54.040- 21:57.880* :  If there is no doubt about the historic levels of apathy and anger here
*21:58.460- 22:00.340* :  who is to blame and what can be done,
*22:00.820- 22:03.880* :  Charles Walker is standing down at the selection after 20 years
*22:03.880- 22:05.280* :  as a Conservatives of MP.
*22:05.280- 22:08.360* :  He's one of those rare politicians in that he has liked
*22:08.360- 22:12.800* :  and respected across the political spectrum of our major blush about Charles.
*22:13.220- 22:14.840* :  You have, you have.
*22:15.280- 22:17.640* :  It's not about apportioning blame, though,
*22:17.880- 22:19.400* :  as to why there are levels of apathy.
*22:19.400- 22:20.700* :  It's trying to understand why.
*22:21.720- 22:25.880* :  And I suspect there are high levels of apathy because for the past 16 years,
*22:25.880- 22:28.820* :  the economy hasn't grown particularly fast,
*22:28.980- 22:30.700* :  and people are feeling worse off.
*22:31.260- 22:33.060* :  And they're feeling grumpy at politicians.
*22:33.440- 22:35.040* :  And I think when people are feeling grumpy,
*22:35.760- 22:38.600* :  you see some drift off to the fringes to the right and left,
*22:38.600- 22:40.520* :  and others just withdraw their vote.
*22:40.840- 22:44.800* :  And right now I think a lot of people feel that they're just walking through very heavy mud.
*22:45.580- 22:47.540* :  You've been a politician for 20 years.
*22:47.880- 22:50.040* :  I mean, does this anger, does it sort of bother you?
*22:51.100- 22:51.620* :  I mean, worry you.
*22:51.740- 22:54.440* :  All anger bothers me and worries me.
*22:54.660- 22:56.240* :  But when people get angry,
*22:56.240- 22:59.000* :  they look for simple solutions to complex questions.
*22:59.920- 23:01.900* :  And that's when you get into demagoguery.
*23:02.500- 23:06.080* :  And as we see in Russia, that doesn't work out so well, does it?
*23:06.360- 23:08.820* :  And at least we have the right to be apathetic in this country.
*23:10.500- 23:12.640* :  Conservative politician, Charles Walker,
*23:12.640- 23:14.520* :  ending that report by Rob Watson.
*23:15.880- 23:21.340* :  Now, is the Islamic State Group making a comeback at the height of its powers in 2015?
*23:21.960- 23:24.880* :  It imposed a real reign of terror over millions of people
*23:25.020- 23:27.580* :  and controlled large areas of Iraq and Syria,
*23:28.320- 23:31.100* :  from which it launched attacks in the region and beyond.
*23:31.660- 23:34.580* :  Over the last few years, IS has been operating in the shadows
*23:34.580- 23:38.060* :  since it was largely crushed by a US-led coalition.
*23:38.740- 23:41.760* :  But in March, gunmen stormed a concert in Moscow,
*23:42.260- 23:46.480* :  killing 145 people and injuring more than 500 others.
*23:47.060- 23:50.520* :  Islamic State said four of its members carried out that attack.
*23:51.220- 23:53.820* :  Officials in Berlin at the Euro-24 football championships
*23:54.480- 23:58.100* :  have warned that there could be similar attacks on the scale of Moscow there.
*23:58.920- 24:02.880* :  The former head of the British Intelligence Services, MI6, Alex Younger
*24:03.380- 24:06.560* :  and the co-director of the Centre on Armed Groups, Ashley Jackson,
*24:07.180- 24:10.640* :  have been giving their thoughts about the reemergence of IS to Nick Robinson.
*24:11.320- 24:15.820* :  It's showing signs of resurgence, but it's not as dangerous as it was in 2016.
*24:16.440- 24:20.200* :  And there are three key areas that we've really got to keep an eye on.
*24:20.200- 24:24.160* :  The first is Syria. So there are a set of refugee camps,
*24:24.160- 24:29.220* :  some prisoner of war camps, where the Kurds are holding the fighters taken prisoner
*24:29.940- 24:31.860* :  after the war against ISIS.
*24:32.540- 24:35.640* :  They're still there. They're powder kegs for radicalisation.
*24:36.360- 24:38.420* :  The resources are limited. The money's limited.
*24:38.980- 24:40.460* :  This problem has not gone away.
*24:40.920- 24:44.140* :  And if those camps go the wrong way, we've all got a problem.
*24:44.440- 24:45.840* :  So we need to keep our eye on that.
*24:46.800- 24:50.280* :  Secondly, we've got a really teasing my enemy.
*24:50.500- 24:53.460* :  Enemy is my friend problem in Afghanistan.
*24:54.440- 24:56.460* :  Actually, on this one, the Taliban's on our side.
*24:56.860- 25:00.480* :  Now, there are medieval pariah states, which hang rightly so,
*25:00.480- 25:01.720* :  given their treatment of women.
*25:01.720- 25:07.880* :  But we need to find a way to incentivise them to further intensify their work against ISIS.
*25:07.880- 25:10.720* :  There's a vicious war going on between the two.
*25:11.160- 25:14.380* :  And that puts us on the same side as some awkward bed fellows.
*25:15.320- 25:16.860* :  And thirdly, in the same context,
*25:17.580- 25:20.420* :  Daesh don't pose an international threat to the extent that they did
*25:20.420- 25:21.940* :  because they don't really have a base.
*25:22.380- 25:24.700* :  But they are building one now in Tajikistan,
*25:25.260- 25:28.780* :  a failing state, beset by poverty and authoritarianism.
*25:29.480- 25:31.980* :  That's why Iran and Russia are being attacked.
*25:32.400- 25:35.860* :  Daesh is reconstituting and has taken leadership into Tajikistan.
*25:36.280- 25:37.160* :  And we've got to work on that.
*25:37.200- 25:41.180* :  And that means something that puts us on the same side as Russia and Iran.
*25:41.600- 25:42.220* :  It's complicated.
*25:42.900- 25:45.180* :  Policy choices. Come back to them in just a second.
*25:45.180- 25:46.160* :  Let me get the perspective.
*25:46.700- 25:49.340* :  First of Ashley Jackson about Daesh.
*25:49.340- 25:51.580* :  That's the French name isn't often used for ISIS.
*25:51.580- 25:55.620* :  It's interchangeable in the conversations that we have about this.
*25:56.340- 25:58.320* :  Well, I can't speak specifically to Syria,
*25:58.620- 26:00.880* :  but I would sort of add to what Sir Alex said.
*26:00.920- 26:03.480* :  And that's that not all ISIS fighters,
*26:03.720- 26:07.740* :  not all Islamic state fighters or sympathisers are locked up in camps, right?
*26:07.800- 26:11.760* :  And a lot of the networks that help to facilitate finances,
*26:11.760- 26:16.880* :  ideology, communications, they still kind of exist in different pockets in Central Asia
*26:17.640- 26:18.860* :  and Pakistan and Turkey elsewhere.
*26:19.700- 26:22.060* :  And more than that, a lot of the attacks that we see now
*26:22.860- 26:24.360* :  are not Islamic state fighters.
*26:24.620- 26:29.400* :  It's these sort of do-it-yourself kind of attacks where small groups or individuals
*26:29.400- 26:33.280* :  can act really autonomously using the Islamic state banner.
*26:33.880- 26:37.800* :  And then the Islamic state claims credit and grabs headlines after the fact.
*26:38.600- 26:41.280* :  And those attacks keep the Islamic state alive.
*26:41.400- 26:42.320* :  And that's what matters.
*26:42.960- 26:48.440* :  As long as they can grab headlines and stay alive as this idea which inspires action
*26:49.080- 26:52.540* :  for people who are sort of dissatisfied or disgruntled or marginalized.
*26:52.900- 26:54.020* :  Sir Alex, there is a chance.
*26:54.220- 26:57.200* :  You've used a striking phrase to describe this up do-it-yourself.
*26:57.240- 26:59.400* :  They're kind of Nike approach to terrorism.
*27:00.020- 27:01.280* :  Yeah, so this is just do-it.
*27:01.420- 27:05.820* :  And I think ISIS are less able to mount complex attacks thankfully
*27:05.860- 27:07.980* :  than they were of the sort we saw in Paris.
*27:08.580- 27:13.260* :  But as Ashley's saying, they propagate a very effective and powerful single narrative online
*27:13.260- 27:18.520* :  and they call on individuals spontaneously to mount attacks just do-it.
*27:18.880- 27:21.220* :  The significance of that is in some ways it's less dangerous,
*27:21.220- 27:23.640* :  but it's much, much more difficult to track.
*27:23.940- 27:27.760* :  Ashley, would you address Sir Alex's point that in the region that I know you particularly study
*27:27.760- 27:32.500* :  Afghanistan and Pakistan, that we may have to do a deal
*27:32.900- 27:35.800* :  in inverted commas with the devil, with the Taliban to take on ISIS?
*27:36.340- 27:40.560* :  Well, the Islamic State had this resurgence in 2022 after the Taliban.
*27:40.560- 27:44.700* :  Take over, but the Taliban, as Sir Alex has rightly pointed out, has cracked down.
*27:45.060- 27:51.120* :  And what we see in Afghanistan, Pakistan, is the Islamic State is basically really suppressed.
*27:51.120- 27:57.180* :  But as in Europe, as in Syria, Iraq, it's still an idea where there's space to operate.
*27:57.980- 27:59.280* :  It's taking that space.
*27:59.280- 28:03.100* :  It exists as this kind of looming threat.
*28:03.340- 28:07.000* :  But it does mean cooperating with governments where there has been these pockets.
*28:07.000- 28:10.380* :  It does mean having a different kind of global approach.
*28:11.440- 28:14.400* :  Ashley Jackson, and before her, we heard Alex Younger.
*28:15.760- 28:24.560* :  In Denmark, from 2030, livestock farmers will be taxed for the greenhouse gases emitted by their cows, sheep and pigs.
*28:25.160- 28:30.000* :  It will be the first country to do so, as it targets a major source of methane emissions.
*28:30.520- 28:33.160* :  The BBC's David Lewis taught me through what was going on.
*28:33.740- 28:38.640* :  So what images Nick spring to mind when you consider the world's most polluting industries?
*28:38.640- 28:43.500* :  There's gas guzzling air travel, shipping's got a pretty whopping carbon footprint too.
*28:43.500- 28:49.240* :  You might be forgiven for not thinking immediately, and Nick, I don't mean this to sound too indelicate,
*28:49.640- 28:51.240* :  flatulent, farmyard animals.
*28:51.360- 28:54.520* :  But the Danes, at least, are stealing a march on methane.
*28:54.520- 28:58.740* :  The Copenhagen government is on a mission to drastically slash emissions.
*28:59.320- 29:01.320* :  And their strategy? Well, it's tax.
*29:01.320- 29:04.000* :  And it's agricultural workers who'll be paying.
*29:04.000- 29:08.960* :  Christian Fronberg from Greenpeace in Denmark says there wasn't much of an option.
*29:09.400- 29:13.340* :  The problem with our livestock emissions in Denmark is actually huge.
*29:13.760- 29:19.620* :  So by 2030, the agriculture will stand for around 50% of Danish emissions.
*29:19.620- 29:25.440* :  So there is really no big of problem in Denmark than our current agricultural system.
*29:25.760- 29:31.520* :  So that is also why we have come to this tipping point where now we are actually getting carbon tax.
*29:32.140- 29:34.480* :  And it could be a vital strategy.
*29:34.480- 29:42.040* :  Gas is released from the burps and back sides of barnyard animals account for about 32% of human caused methane emissions.
*29:42.560- 29:44.820* :  So says the United Nations Environment Program.
*29:45.160- 29:47.940* :  The gas traps even more heat than carbon dioxide.
*29:47.940- 29:52.900* :  A major contributor to global warming and current climate change trends.
*29:53.140- 29:55.300* :  So David, how's the tax going to work?
*29:55.760- 30:01.920* :  Well, as of 2030, Danish livestock farmers will pay a levy of about $50 per ton of emissions.
*30:01.920- 30:08.240* :  Now, a typical cow in Denmark produces six metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year.
*30:08.500- 30:13.860* :  And as a major dairy and meat exporter, there's almost 1.5 million head of cattle in the country.
*30:13.900- 30:16.680* :  So the pollution and tariffs tot up.
*30:16.940- 30:21.300* :  Taxes raised will go towards reforestation and other domestic green initiatives.
*30:21.300- 30:26.080* :  The Danes have set a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2045.
*30:26.080- 30:32.740* :  And despite the financial pressure, this might put on farmers have called for other countries to follow suit.
*30:33.420- 30:33.940* :  David Lewis.
*30:35.160- 30:41.860* :  And the podcast with artificial intelligence, which has certainly ruffled a few feathers of late in the world of music.
*30:42.620- 30:48.540* :  Pioneering artists who may want to embrace cutting edge technology sounded the alarm last year.
*30:49.020- 30:53.920* :  That's over YouTube's new tool that can generate songs with apparent ease.
*30:54.500- 31:03.500* :  YouTube has reportedly tried to calm the storm by offering cash upfront to record labels so it can make use of their music to train the tool.
*31:04.160- 31:06.640* :  But will it be enough to convince the big stars?
*31:06.640- 31:13.880* :  Amal Rajan has been hearing reaction to this from George Fitzgerald, a DJ and electronic musician and producer.
*31:14.580- 31:20.400* :  I have to say I'm struggling to see the positive in this summer for eight for musicians.
*31:20.520- 31:25.880* :  I obviously I'm seeing this strictly from a musician's point of view and from a creative point of view.
*31:26.280- 31:31.440* :  And this just looks like a pretty dystopian scenario for musicians.
*31:31.440- 31:37.560* :  And it's something that I really hope that the major labels and other labels would resist to be honest.
*31:37.980- 31:40.500* :  I don't want to seem like a Luddite here.
*31:40.840- 31:49.840* :  You know, it's not lost on me that people called synthesizers nearly a hundred years ago, illegitimate instruments and thought that they were going to replace humans.
*31:49.840- 31:53.760* :  But it really did this really does feel like a different scenario.
*31:53.760- 32:04.280* :  You're not just replacing primary artists, almost you were replacing all of the secondary people in music who work behind the scenes recording engineers, producers,
*32:05.520- 32:07.460* :  studio technicians, everything.
*32:07.460- 32:18.660* :  You're talking about completely wiping out an infrastructure and it just sort of feels like something that seems like a good idea in a Silicon Valley boardroom to be honest to sort of get rid of inefficient.
*32:18.660- 32:22.460* :  And efficient and expensive inconvenience that musicians represent.
*32:22.600- 32:29.360* :  It is the case. I mean, people have often said that artificial intelligence, you know, there is a kind of dystopian idea that in the end it could replace humans.
*32:29.420- 32:34.880* :  This is quite literally the industry of music suggesting an efficient way of actually doing that, isn't it?
*32:34.880- 32:44.880* :  It's actually using trained artificial intelligence to create sounds, productions that would in effect in a much more efficient technological way.
*32:44.880- 32:49.660* :  Do what is currently done by, as you say, a whole world of musicians and creatives and engineers.
*32:50.040- 32:55.860* :  Absolutely. And we're already there in a sense that there is a lot of AI already happening within music.
*32:55.920- 33:04.580* :  I mean, behind the scenes in a technical sense, there's a lot of things being marketed as AI that use similar processes that are helping us make the music quicker.
*33:04.820- 33:08.760* :  But the human is the ultimate arbiter in this. There's a human at the end of it.
*33:08.820- 33:20.780* :  And this is the first thing I've seen really apart from them, the suit and audio services, which are still sort of at the chat GPT level of being good, but not convincing ultimately.
*33:20.780- 33:27.000* :  This is something that, you know, potentially is opening a door to saying, well, we're going to replace you forever.
*33:27.480- 33:33.960* :  You know, I have some reservations about whether humans themselves are ultimately going to want to listen to this music in replacement.
*33:33.960- 33:45.480* :  You know, in lieu of actual human-made music, but they're talking about a one-off payment as well, which just feels a little bit like if you let YouTube do this, then the horse has bolted forever.
*33:46.140- 33:49.720* :  DJ, electronic musician and producer George Fitzgerald.
*33:52.060- 33:55.880* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
