*01:19.200- 01:21.760* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.100- 01:28.140* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 19th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:28.140- 01:36.880* :  President Biden has announced a new policy that would protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation.
*01:36.880- 01:43.560* :  The Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in North Korea, the first visit there in nearly a quarter of a century.
*01:46.180- 01:56.060* :  Also in this podcast, the extreme wealth of the few comes at the expense of the poverty and financial insecurity of an unspeakably large number of people.
*01:56.520- 01:58.980* :  The Austrian areas are giving away her millions.
*02:02.400- 02:07.640* :  Immigration is likely to be a key issue in November's presidential election in the United States.
*02:07.640- 02:17.160* :  And now, President Biden has announced a new policy to protect about half a million undocumented migrants who are married to US citizens from being deported.
*02:17.500- 02:22.920* :  Today, I'm announcing new measures to clarify and speed up work visas to help people including dreamers,
*02:23.180- 02:32.040* :  who have graduated from US colleges and universities, landed jobs and high demand high skilled professions that we need to have the grow economy grow.
*02:32.640- 02:36.440* :  I want to keep building the strongest economy in the world with the best workforce in the world.
*02:36.780- 02:43.600* :  Mr. Biden also said the change would streamline the current system, which he said was cumbersome and separated families.
*02:44.200- 02:47.180* :  I got more details from our Washington correspondent, Nomi Iqbal.
*02:47.640- 02:54.820* :  This policy is aimed at people who've been living in the United States for more than a decade and so they've built their lives and families here.
*02:55.360- 03:00.820* :  If you marry an American, generally that provides a pathway to US citizenship eventually.
*03:00.820- 03:08.300* :  But if you cross into the country illegally, you would have to return to your home country to complete the process for a green card.
*03:08.300- 03:12.940* :  And so that can take years and years and it also means you'd have to split up your family.
*03:12.940- 03:22.940* :  So what President Biden is doing with this new program is basically allowing families to remain together in the US whilst that person pursues legal status.
*03:22.940- 03:30.160* :  But there are some conditions, so the spouses must have lived here for 10 years and been married as of June 17th.
*03:30.200- 03:37.940* :  It's also worth pointing out that the policy will benefit the children of undocumented spouses who became step children to American citizens.
*03:38.040- 03:41.280* :  So it's thought to benefit around 50,000 children.
*03:41.720- 03:47.300* :  And Nomi, a reminder how this kind of approach contrasts with Donald Trump's promises about immigration.
*03:47.720- 03:57.600* :  Joe Biden does want to tighten access to asylum but he also wants to let some long term undocumented people apply for residency in the United States.
*03:57.600- 03:59.800* :  He's trying to strike this sort of balanced tone.
*04:00.500- 04:03.040* :  Whereas Donald Trump is totally going one direction.
*04:03.080- 04:07.060* :  He's campaigning on a almost entirely punitive crackdown.
*04:07.060- 04:17.440* :  So he's already saying I'm going to unleash the biggest mass deportation in US history and deploying military, police units, creating big detention camps.
*04:17.500- 04:22.480* :  And so his rhetoric has become pretty inflammatory as well.
*04:22.480- 04:25.120* :  There was a campaign rally he held in Michigan.
*04:25.120- 04:36.820* :  You made these claims that immigrants were coming in by the millions he was using terms like destruction or the American suburbs poisoning the blood of Americans and so forth.
*04:37.200- 04:44.860* :  Nomi, a president Biden this evening was saying he's not interested in playing politics with border immigration but fixing it.
*04:44.860- 04:51.980* :  But there is no doubt from what you've just been saying that the border promises and policies are a vote winner or a vote loser, aren't they?
*04:52.200- 05:02.360* :  They are polls consistently suggest that it's often a number one concern for voters. I mean, certainly in the top few and president Biden did two weeks ago.
*05:02.360- 05:12.480* :  If you remember, he unveiled this major crackdown at the US, Mexico border, which basically cuts off access to asylum for people who cross into America illegally.
*05:13.260- 05:20.940* :  And he was criticized by members of his own party, the more progressive members for not having a more humane approach.
*05:20.940- 05:34.480* :  And so I think this program attempts to answer that call, but there is no doubt that immigration is a political vulnerability for him because he is acting with just months to go before the November presidential election.
*05:34.920- 05:45.340* :  Nomi, Iqbal, in Washington, Ashley, as a veto is the head of American families, United, that's a group that supports mixed status families.
*05:45.800- 05:51.460* :  Her husband is also undocumented and so will be one of the people that will benefit from this new policy.
*05:52.060- 05:56.740* :  Now, Alma Gaffee first asked her for a reaction to president Biden's announcement.
*05:57.360- 06:02.380* :  We're very optimistic and hopeful. We don't know all of the details yet.
*06:03.340- 06:13.520* :  So we believe in the days and weeks ahead, our work will continue, our advocacy work will continue to make sure that all of the families we've been fighting for are included in this.
*06:14.120- 06:18.040* :  But we are very optimistic and excited. This is historical.
*06:18.820- 06:26.340* :  But also these plans impact you personally, don't they? Because you've been married to someone who's undocumented for over 12 years now.
*06:26.880- 06:30.120* :  So tell me how, you know, the difficulties you faced.
*06:30.120- 06:36.600* :  Correct. We've been married for 18 years. My husband is from Brazil and we met.
*06:36.600- 06:48.080* :  So in love, he's a great man. We have a child together. Unfortunately, though, this undocumented status has prevented him from being able to see his parents back in Brazil.
*06:48.080- 06:54.480* :  He has not seen his mom since he was 18 years old. You know, obviously now he's a full grown man.
*06:54.480- 06:59.300* :  He missed his father's funeral because of the inability to travel.
*07:00.280- 07:06.060* :  So it's been very, very difficult to say the least. It affects everything we do in our daily life.
*07:06.860- 07:11.100* :  But we're hoping that this is the day that those things start to change.
*07:11.540- 07:16.940* :  I mean, that must have been really hard, but I'm guessing it also impacts, you know, where he can work.
*07:17.400- 07:19.100* :  Where has he been working up until now?
*07:19.360- 07:24.980* :  Absolutely. He really, we've been relying on my income because he does not have work authorization.
*07:24.980- 07:27.620* :  Can you even go on holidays as a family?
*07:28.160- 07:31.340* :  Only locally. We really don't travel far at all.
*07:32.320- 07:38.040* :  But I guess this decision, you know, if it's implemented, it's been a long time coming.
*07:38.040- 07:40.400* :  What are the first things you want to do?
*07:41.040- 07:47.740* :  The first thing I want to do while I haven't thought about that, I think probably travel to Brazil.
*07:47.980- 07:51.740* :  So my husband can see his mother and I can meet my mother-in-law.
*07:52.600- 08:00.360* :  Ashley, as a dedu, spouse of an undocumented migrant in the US and head of American founders united.
*08:02.020- 08:09.840* :  The international organization for migration says nearly 600,000 people have now been displaced by gang violence in Haiti.
*08:10.400- 08:13.140* :  That's an increase of 60% since March.
*08:13.960- 08:19.300* :  The UN agency says it's a direct consequence of years of spiraling conflict between armed gangs.
*08:20.100- 08:20.780* :  We'll grant reports.
*08:20.780- 08:31.000* :  The latest assessment from the UN's international organization for migration is an important dose of reality for anyone who thought things were returning to normal in the beleaguered Caribbean nation.
*08:31.500- 08:37.280* :  For almost 600,000 people forced from their homes by their violence, life remains extremely tough.
*08:37.900- 08:45.780* :  Not only are they no longer able to live in their communities after their neighborhoods became too dangerous, many also lost their jobs and homes in the process.
*08:45.780- 08:55.500* :  Thousands of children and young people have been forced out of their schooling as their families live in temporary accommodation and struggle to find enough food and clean water each day.
*08:56.080- 08:56.540* :  We'll grant.
*08:57.580- 09:09.420* :  Next, Boeing's chief executive, Dave Calhoun, faced tough questioning on Tuesday about the safety culture at the firm during an appearance before a Congressional committee in Washington.
*09:09.420- 09:14.220* :  The committee chairman, Senator Richard Blumenthal, said it was a moment of reckoning.
*09:14.420- 09:18.840* :  He accused the U.S. planemaker of continuing to put profit before people.
*09:18.840- 09:29.160* :  Mr. Calhoun said Boeing had taken action to ensure there could be no repeat of an accident in January in which a fuselage panel fell off an Alaska Airlines plane.
*09:29.660- 09:31.280* :  Much has been said about Boeing's culture.
*09:31.880- 09:33.900* :  We've heard those concerns loud and clear.
*09:34.660- 09:39.420* :  Our culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and we are making progress.
*09:39.960- 09:44.900* :  We understand the gravity and we're committed to moving forward with transparency and accountability.
*09:45.860- 09:55.880* :  Before the hearing began, relatives of victims of two deadly plane crashes involving Boeing 737 MAX aircraft held up pictures of their loved ones.
*09:56.500- 09:59.860* :  The Russian president Vladimir Putin has arrived in North Korea.
*09:59.860- 10:03.400* :  He was greeted off the plane by the country's leader, Kim Jong-un.
*10:03.860- 10:08.400* :  Mr. Putin has praised Pyongyang for firmly supporting the war in Ukraine.
*10:09.040- 10:12.380* :  Our correspondent, Shama Khalil, reports from the South Korean capital, Seoul.
*10:13.180- 10:17.020* :  For the first time in more than two decades, Vladimir Putin has landed in Pyongyang.
*10:17.020- 10:27.860* :  Images and footage shared by the Russian state-owned news agency Rihanna Vosti have shown banners welcoming Vladimir Putin along the freeway in the North Korean capital, lined with propaganda posters.
*10:27.860- 10:30.900* :  The friendship between North Korea and Russia is eternal.
*10:30.900- 10:34.600* :  Says one banner outside Pyongyang's Sunan International Airport.
*10:34.620- 10:39.720* :  On other reads, we warmly welcome comrade Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.
*10:39.720- 10:46.800* :  The relationship between Mr. Putin and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, has developed significantly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*10:46.800- 10:53.500* :  North Korea needs help with space technology after its recent failure to put a second spy satellite into orbit.
*10:54.240- 11:03.720* :  Shama Khalil, in Seoul, will the U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has expressed concern about this visit because of Pyongyang's military support for Moscow.
*11:04.200- 11:14.380* :  Russia tried in desperation to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine.
*11:14.920- 11:21.780* :  North Korea is providing significant munitions to Russia and other weapons for using Ukraine.
*11:22.540- 11:29.440* :  For more on the significance of the visit to North Korea by the Russian President, I spoke to Vitaly Shechenko from BBC Monitoring.
*11:29.820- 11:38.200* :  Vladimir Putin, the reasons for going to North Korea, are both pragmatic and symbolic.
*11:38.800- 11:55.920* :  On a symbolic level, he is keen to show that, look, I've got friends, I can go places, I can travel and be greeted and celebrated even if it's North Korea, which has been a pariah on the international stage for decades.
*11:56.880- 12:15.680* :  Now on a practical level, the thinking is that Vladimir Putin is keen to secure more weapons supplies from North Korea, ammunition supplies, and this is something that we think has been going on for months.
*12:16.740- 12:30.020* :  There are satellite images showing shipments of containers from North Korea to Russia, presumably, that's according to South Korea, containing ammunition rounds.
*12:31.240- 12:42.920* :  Also, debris found in Ukraine suggests that Russia has been using North Korean ballistic missiles against cities such as Kharkiv.
*12:43.300- 12:56.180* :  So there is evidence that Russia has been buying munitions from North Korea in breach of UN sanctions, which Russia had voted for before.
*12:56.360- 13:00.560* :  Now, all of those agreements are out of the way, as far as Russia is concerned.
*13:01.680- 13:08.680* :  Both Moscow and Pyongyang deny engaging in weapons trade, but there are very good reasons for them to do that.
*13:09.180- 13:22.000* :  For President Putin to make his first visit in 24 years to North Korea, it might suggest a dire need of armaments, if indeed that is what's going on from North Korea.
*13:22.000- 13:26.460* :  Do we know how dependent Russia might be on armaments from places like North Korea?
*13:27.120- 13:31.180* :  Well, not very, but at this stage, every little helps.
*13:32.140- 13:44.820* :  Munitions rounds and less sophisticated missiles is something that Russia has learned to produce by the thousands, by tens of thousands, so that's not a huge problem for Russia.
*13:45.680- 14:00.840* :  But at no stage, will either Russia, or Ukraine, be in a situation where we don't need anything more, so whatever Russia can secure in terms of weapons from Iran, North Korea, that helps.
*14:00.840- 14:13.900* :  And it's true that Russians will remember the time when there were more countries willing to cooperate with Russia than just North Korea, Iran and the handful of others.
*14:14.500- 14:29.720* :  So from that point of view, optics look different, but for years, Russians have been told that Moscow is keen to engage in cooperation with all countries of the world, put an end to Western dominance.
*14:29.720- 14:35.760* :  Vladimir Putin has been saying that he's keen to develop what he calls a multipolar world.
*14:36.200- 14:39.340* :  What might North Korea get out of this from Russia?
*14:39.620- 14:54.320* :  First of all, economic assistance. Food may be. The fact is, we don't really know, but it's something that Russia is in a position offer, and it's reasonable to assume that this is what North Korea will be asking for.
*14:54.800- 15:03.500* :  Vitaly Shevchenko. Now, just imagine you've inherited more than 26 million dollars. What exactly would you do with your fortune?
*15:04.000- 15:15.060* :  For most of us, all sorts of luxurious pursuits and purchases sprang to mind, but for the 32-year-old Marlena Engelhorn, that question was not theoretical.
*15:15.540- 15:23.520* :  Her solution to give the money away, and now a citizen's group of 50 people has decided to how the Austro-German ares will do it.
*15:24.060- 15:26.500* :  I've got more from our correspondent in Vienna, Bethany Bell.
*15:26.900- 15:48.520* :  Marlena Engelhorn made big headlines because she was going to give away the bulk of her inheritance from her grandmother, 25 million euros, that's 26.8 million dollars, and she was going to appoint a panel of people to decide how the money should be spent.
*15:48.620- 16:10.940* :  She is a descendant of the founder of a very big German chemical and pharmaceutical company, Friedrich Engelhorn, and her grandmother left her a great deal of money back in September 2022, since then she had said she had wanted to hand out most of that inheritance.
*16:11.620- 16:16.200* :  What has this group of 50 people decided to do with the money?
*16:16.680- 16:22.400* :  This is a group that was picked by a pollster to be representative of Austrian society.
*16:23.120- 16:36.120* :  They have determined that the money should go to 77 different organisations, so charities, some left-wing think tanks, social groups, climate groups,
*16:36.780- 16:52.100* :  and the smallest amount of money is going to an initiative which reports on climate change, and the largest sum of money, 1.6 million euros, is going to something called the Austrian Nature Conservation Federation.
*16:52.500- 17:00.860* :  And Bethany, let's listen to a clip from Marlena speaking recently about why she decided to get rid of her money like this.
*17:01.500- 17:06.220* :  I don't care if Bethany doesn't share a certain discourse, the part of which she feels is now 10.5 million.
*17:06.620- 17:12.820* :  I'm not starting a debate at all. I'm taking part in an existing discourse that has been going on for decades.
*17:13.480- 17:17.860* :  Only I'm being listened to to a much greater extent because I'm rich myself.
*17:17.860- 17:25.700* :  Income distribution works in such a way that if there's extreme wealth on one side, there's extreme poverty on the other.
*17:25.700- 17:35.820* :  In other words, the extreme wealth of the few comes at the expense of the poverty and financial insecurity of an unspeakably large number of people.
*17:36.180- 17:49.600* :  And Miss Egelhorn has said, it's now up to politicians to take on the question of redistribution of wealth, the inherited wealth, she said, contradicts every democratic principle.
*17:50.360- 17:50.880* :  Bethany Bell.
*17:53.640- 17:54.240* :  Still to come.

*18:01.220- 18:01.600* :  Your total is 1138.

*18:02.620- 18:07.260* :  An AI shambles that led to some very out there hamburger combos.
*18:16.000- 18:17.280* :  Ryan Reynolds here from InMobile.

*19:30.080- 19:35.680* :  Residents in two towns, Jiga and Keranio in Ethiopia's Restive Amhara region.
*19:36.300- 19:40.360* :  Say the army has summarily executed more than 20 civilians.
*19:41.400- 19:43.900* :  The authorities have not responded to the claims.
*19:43.900- 19:48.440* :  From Addis Ababa, our correspondent, Calcutan Ibeltel has the details.
*19:48.860- 19:58.200* :  Residents of Jiga and Keranio towns told the BBC that security forces had executed several civilians including teachers shooting them at close range.
*19:58.200- 20:03.020* :  The incidents followed clashes between members of the army and local phanomelicious.
*20:03.320- 20:13.280* :  The BBC has not independently confirmed the killings and getting a picture of the true extent of the ongoing violence in parts of the Amhara region has been extremely difficult.
*20:13.280- 20:22.000* :  The UN's Human Rights Council reports that more than 700 civilians were killed in the region last year, most of them by Ethiopian government forces.
*20:22.880- 20:24.780* :  Calcutan Ibeltel in Ethiopia.
*20:26.140- 20:34.440* :  Researchers have found a way of identifying whether someone is likely to develop the neurological disease Parkinson's years before they show symptoms.
*20:34.920- 20:43.380* :  Scientists in Britain and Germany used artificial intelligence to measure the concentration of certain proteins in the blood which can provide an early indication.
*20:43.860- 20:47.360* :  It could lead to the development of a simple finger prick test.
*20:47.880- 20:50.420* :  This report from our health reporter, Philippa Roxby.
*20:50.840- 20:59.960* :  There are no treatments available to slow or stock Parkinson's, although therapies can help people manage symptoms such as tremors, movement and memory problems.
*21:00.720- 21:06.580* :  The disease affects nearly 10 million people worldwide and more than 150,000 in the UK.
*21:06.620- 21:16.140* :  With the help of a machine learning tool, the researchers identified eight major proteins in the blood most likely to indicate who would develop the neurological condition.
*21:16.140- 21:23.980* :  They were then able to correctly predict that happening in 16 people, in some cases seven years before symptoms began.
*21:23.980- 21:31.860* :  Patients are still being followed up to confirm the accuracy of the test and larger trials are now needed in different groups of people.
*21:32.320- 21:37.180* :  The study author, Professor Kevin Mills from University College London, explained its potential.
*21:37.520- 21:45.760* :  If we have this test to predict Parkinson's or people who are certainly at risk of Parkinson's disease, you can identify more, they can go into more trials.
*21:45.760- 21:50.160* :  The trials can be shorter because there's no test for Parkinson's disease.
*21:50.160- 21:57.740* :  But if you have a biomarker and you can measure those things going up and down, you can much quicker to see if those therapeutic interventions are working.
*21:57.900- 22:05.400* :  The charity Parkinson's UK said the blood test was a major step forward in the search for a non-invasive patient-friendly test.
*22:05.840- 22:13.380* :  The researchers now plan to create an even simpler test where a finger prick drop of blood on a card can be posted to a lab.
*22:14.020- 22:16.700* :  But this is likely to take some years to develop.
*22:17.800- 22:18.640* :  Philippa Roxby.
*22:19.680- 22:27.280* :  Now, we are often hearing that artificial intelligence is already much smarter than we are and is on the verge of taking our jobs.
*22:27.280- 22:31.980* :  But the hope is that it might make life blissfully simple in the process.
*22:32.400- 22:38.600* :  And what could be a better example of that, then it's seamlessly taking your order in a fast food drive-through.
*22:39.200- 22:41.600* :  Well, the Donalds has been trying out exactly that.
*22:42.240- 22:45.500* :  But safe to say, it's gone a little wrong. Here's Alfie Habisham.
*22:46.420- 22:48.160* :  Welcome to McDonald's. May I take your order, please?
*22:48.640- 22:56.620* :  Forget about the stress of pushing past hungry cues or having to defend your table because you've not even set foot outside your own car.
*22:57.240- 22:59.140* :  And a big mac is at your fingertips.
*22:59.820- 23:05.600* :  But maybe the only thing that could take it to the next level is not even having to speak to another human being.
*23:06.340- 23:14.760* :  Well, as usual, McDonald's is one step ahead, because now you can drive past a large screen, mumbling your desires, and AI will do the rest.
*23:15.480- 23:17.960* :  And so far, people have been really enjoying it.
*23:26.920- 23:31.820* :  Well, I'd be laughing, too, if I was being cooked up 230 chicken McNuggets.
*23:32.280- 23:36.060* :  And that's because the McDonald's robot seems to have a bit of a mind of its own.
*23:36.700- 23:43.840* :  No, cream packet, no! I just want a large water and a cup of ice cream.
*23:44.260- 23:45.760* :  Now the ketchup back out, oh my god!
*23:45.760- 23:50.880* :  Okay, so maybe the menu has got a bit samey over the years, but ice cream and ketchup.
*23:51.580- 23:55.160* :  Having said that, ice cream top with bacon does sound a bit more tempting.
*23:55.160- 23:59.100* :  But either way, you're probably not getting what you actually asked for.
*23:59.260- 24:00.240* :  Would you like anything else?
*24:00.540- 24:00.800* :  No.
*24:02.040- 24:02.600* :  It can't so.
*24:02.600- 24:05.460* :  Everything looks correct. Your total is 1138.
*24:06.200- 24:06.380* :  No.
*24:06.380- 24:07.500* :  I'm so forward to the payment.
*24:07.920- 24:10.040* :  No, that's not correct.
*24:10.400- 24:20.520* :  Of course, it's not the only US restaurant chain that's been looking to slim down costs recently, especially after California passed a new minimum wage of $20 an hour for fast food workers in April.
*24:21.140- 24:27.500* :  But McDonald's says for now that its AI waiter is getting the sack from the 100 restaurants that it was being tested.
*24:28.180- 24:32.880* :  It gave no reason for the decision, but perhaps for once, our human beings just do it better.
*24:34.960- 24:35.600* :  Alfie Habersham.
*24:36.520- 24:37.660* :  Now, have a listen to this.
*24:46.160- 24:51.740* :  And that is calm down by the 24 year old Nigerian singer, Rema.
*24:52.240- 25:03.680* :  It has become the most streamed Afrobeat song in the US after earning more than 1 billion on demand streams there, according to the music monitoring platform chart data.
*25:04.160- 25:15.200* :  This comes after Rema partnered with the US singer Selena Gomez for a remix of the 2022 song, which hit the billion plays mark on the streaming app Spotify.
*25:15.840- 25:24.400* :  That remix is currently the most watched music video by a Nigerian artist on YouTube with nearly 894 million views.
*25:24.620- 25:34.680* :  James Reynolds spoke to DJ Edu, who presents the BBC World Service Show This Is Africa featuring the hottest Afrobeat sounds from all corners of Africa.
*25:35.120- 25:39.820* :  He asked him, why has this song by the Nigerian singer, Rema, become so successful?
*25:40.360- 25:44.380* :  It's quite a catchy song and it's one of those things along.
*25:44.380- 25:53.100* :  If you look back to pop culture and pop history and you look at some of the songs that were big back in the day, and you think to yourself, why did I like this song?
*25:53.200- 25:57.200* :  This one kind of like takes that box. It's like it's so catchy, it's so repetitive.
*25:57.840- 26:03.560* :  You can learn anyone can learn the lyrics. You don't need to go and looking for the lyrics to be able to sing it.
*26:05.260- 26:11.260* :  What's this song already going to be a hit, or did the fact that Selena Gomez gives it that extra push in America? Did that make a difference?
*26:12.040- 26:21.400* :  I look at it as, you know, she just added a bit of source because she comes from a market which also has a lot of listenership and she has a big following as well.
*26:21.400- 26:28.600* :  So it did help. These collaborations, I think, are the ones that are developing Afrobeat to hire higher new heights.
*26:29.280- 26:33.480* :  You've interviewed Rema for your own BBC show. Tell us about what he's like.
*26:34.260- 26:44.020* :  When I first met him, he was quite shy. I was actually introduced to him by the prints who actually found him and horned his skills for about a year.
*26:44.400- 26:48.060* :  And he brought me this young man is like, yeah, I see something in him. He's really talented.
*26:48.960- 26:57.520* :  And, you know, he had an EP out of the time called Rema. It had a very big song called Corny and Do Maybe, which were doing the rounds.
*26:57.940- 27:05.560* :  And he hadn't really grown into his own. It's really good to see him growing to become a real big pop star worldwide and fill up big venues.
*27:06.180- 27:12.420* :  And of course Afrobeat is huge, not just in parts of Africa, but in so many parts of the world and now in the United States.
*27:13.240- 27:18.120* :  As well, what is it about the genre that makes it travel so well as music?
*27:18.700- 27:34.560* :  I think it patterns in music repeat themselves. Those are time when British pop was really big German techno and trans because it was very acceptable and very appealing and easy to listen to is very easy going with Afrobeat.
*27:35.280- 27:40.760* :  Because the music is so easy going and it's so simple and it's sent to the around melody and having a good time.
*27:41.240- 27:48.640* :  I think after the 2019, the buckle that happened in the world, I think Afrobeat is such a research piece of music.
*27:49.120- 27:52.720* :  I think it's just an uplifting thing that makes people just think of the good times.
*28:06.420- 28:11.140* :  DJ Edu from the BBC World Service Show, this is Africa, talking to James Reynolds.
*28:13.640- 28:18.560* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
