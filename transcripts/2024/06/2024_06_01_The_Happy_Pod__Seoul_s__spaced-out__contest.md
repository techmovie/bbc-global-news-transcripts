*01:27.500- 01:36.380* :  I'm Vanessa Heaney and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 1st of June, we're in South Korea and meet the winner of the spaced out competition.
*01:40.120- 01:45.400* :  I think the core essence of spacing out is just learning to rest and enjoying that rest.
*01:46.340- 01:50.620* :  The two friends, aiming to fix the relationship between two countries.
*01:50.620- 01:58.500* :  Every moment of the day, there are people cheering, showing the kids to the other side of the family that lives on the other country.
*01:58.500- 02:04.400* :  And you feel it sometimes even bringing musicians and making parties on both sides of the border.
*02:05.220- 02:06.880* :  One podcast at a time.
*02:07.480- 02:12.940* :  Also in this podcast, the Hungry Sea Line, which hitches a ride on a rowing team's boat.
*02:13.400- 02:17.140* :  Here's just walking around kind of in circles on the dark, you know, just like spinning.
*02:17.640- 02:20.120* :  So that's when you can really tell the person something wrong with him.
*02:26.340- 02:26.560* :  Hello.
*02:27.680- 02:30.540* :  What pops into your mind when you think of South Korea?
*02:31.360- 02:36.100* :  Snazi Kpop videos, high tech electronics, maybe neon lit cities.
*02:36.940- 02:41.680* :  But just 70 years ago, this Asian country was torn apart by a war.
*02:42.480- 02:46.940* :  It's remarkable transformation into one of the richest in the world has been well documented.
*02:47.660- 02:50.580* :  But such rapid growth didn't come without a price.
*02:51.480- 02:56.040* :  Modern South Korea is a hyper competitive society with a strict work culture,
*02:56.480- 03:01.240* :  where many South Koreans are simply too anxious to take a break for fear of falling behind.
*03:02.260- 03:06.300* :  Ten years ago, one local artist wanted to take a break from this lifestyle
*03:06.860- 03:11.420* :  and came up with a contest that aims to spread the art of doing nothing.
*03:12.220- 03:15.660* :  It spawned an international version now in its eighth edition.
*03:16.620- 03:19.660* :  Jason Lee spoke to two contestants to find out more.
*03:24.460- 03:28.360* :  The streets of central Seoul are filled with people constantly on the move,
*03:28.820- 03:31.440* :  those trying to juggle their hectic daily lives.
*03:31.980- 03:35.760* :  And in the heart of this enormous city lies the landmark Kwangamun,
*03:36.100- 03:40.500* :  the main gate of the ancient Kyeongbokung Palace that overlooks a major street.
*03:41.360- 03:46.040* :  Last Sunday, an event took place in stark contrast with its usual busy surroundings,
*03:46.540- 03:48.680* :  the international spaced out competition.
*03:49.440- 03:53.460* :  Participants simply sit still and do absolutely nothing for 90 minutes,
*03:53.980- 03:55.500* :  but must not fall asleep.
*03:56.140- 03:59.080* :  Created by the South Korean artist Su-Pseung a decade ago,
*03:59.520- 04:03.460* :  it's become more popular over the years, spreading to other cities around the world.
*04:05.660- 04:07.260* :  Many brave the reign to take part,
*04:07.580- 04:09.400* :  including the office worker Kim Gi-gyeong,
*04:09.460- 04:13.300* :  who nearly missed out after being called in to work on the morning before the event.
*04:18.360- 04:22.760* :  I thought some people would give up during the events because of the reign, but no one did.
*04:23.340- 04:24.880* :  I think it's because it was a competition,
*04:25.540- 04:29.120* :  even though the purpose was to relax and not compete against each other,
*04:29.540- 04:30.820* :  people ended up competing.
*04:31.440- 04:34.760* :  South Korea is known to have an excessive comparison culture,
*04:35.260- 04:37.940* :  where many feel an immense pressure to keep up with others.
*04:37.960- 04:41.920* :  The country has one of the longest working hours among developed nations.
*04:46.560- 04:48.860* :  South Korean society values competition.
*04:48.880- 04:51.720* :  We always strive for extreme efficiency.
*04:52.300- 04:54.820* :  This makes us see break times as a waste of time,
*04:55.160- 04:56.360* :  because I was sitting still.
*04:56.760- 04:59.860* :  I couldn't help but think about work for the first hour or so.
*05:00.420- 05:02.820* :  I thought to myself, I should have written that email.
*05:02.820- 05:08.180* :  The last 30 minutes, I think I did manage to space out by gazing into the rainy,
*05:08.180- 05:09.280* :  Gwang-women square.
*05:10.180- 05:13.680* :  In fact, working overtime is so common that the slang yagan,
*05:13.680- 05:18.220* :  an abbreviation for nighttime work, has become a household word in South Korea.
*05:19.000- 05:21.880* :  And that's where the space start competition comes into it
*05:21.880- 05:25.100* :  to combat overworking and promote taking breaks.
*05:28.920- 05:32.440* :  I think the core essence of spacing out is just learning to rest
*05:32.500- 05:34.460* :  and enjoying that rest.
*05:35.020- 05:37.600* :  The winner is the contestant who relaxes the most,
*05:37.600- 05:39.360* :  maintaining the low's heart rate.
*05:39.820- 05:42.700* :  The champion relaxer this year was Valentina Villaches,
*05:43.080- 05:46.840* :  who's originally from Chile and now lives in South Korea with her Korean husband.
*05:47.600- 05:51.400* :  Her secret, staying true to the competition's name by spacing out.
*05:52.100- 05:55.480* :  I was connecting with everything around me,
*05:55.480- 05:58.140* :  but not interacting with the things around me.
*05:58.140- 06:02.220* :  I was looking at the rain or listening to the rain,
*06:02.260- 06:04.420* :  but not really focusing on what was going on.
*06:04.740- 06:07.460* :  Actually, in one moment, there was an insect in my leg,
*06:07.460- 06:09.900* :  and I started just looking at it like just moving,
*06:10.100- 06:14.620* :  not interacting with it, but just contemplating and listening
*06:15.640- 06:18.920* :  without paying much attention, just connecting with my senses.
*06:19.420- 06:22.480* :  A doctor by profession, Valentina says taking a breather
*06:22.480- 06:24.400* :  helps reduce stress and anxiety.
*06:25.300- 06:28.080* :  But it was also a learning experience for herself too.
*06:28.460- 06:30.960* :  I realized that actually I needed time to relax.
*06:31.000- 06:32.420* :  I needed time to space out.
*06:32.900- 06:35.460* :  I wasn't very aware of how much I needed in my life,
*06:35.600- 06:39.960* :  so I think I will start implementing it from like every day,
*06:39.960- 06:42.620* :  at least five or ten minutes or every week
*06:43.520- 06:46.320* :  to relax and disconnect from the reality,
*06:47.200- 06:50.100* :  and the society and the internet and the social media.
*06:50.740- 06:53.880* :  That was Valentina Viltra speaking to Jason Lee,
*06:53.880- 06:56.720* :  and I think we might have a go at that on the happy pod team this week.
*06:58.180- 07:01.940* :  For a long time, Morocco and Algeria have been sworn enemies.
*07:01.940- 07:06.860* :  There are simmering tensions over the disputed territory of Western Sahara,
*07:07.700- 07:10.040* :  and the border between the two North African countries
*07:10.040- 07:11.660* :  remains firmly closed.
*07:12.460- 07:15.600* :  But now, two young friends, Hafid Bhutaleb from Morocco
*07:15.600- 07:19.780* :  and a mean Buhasan from Algeria, are hoping to change all that.
*07:20.380- 07:22.820* :  They've created an association called ESEM
*07:23.100- 07:24.960* :  to promote economic integration,
*07:25.560- 07:28.200* :  and now they're launching a podcast, Yala Talk,
*07:28.200- 07:30.620* :  to encourage friendship between the two countries.
*07:31.500- 07:33.980* :  Richard Hamilton asked them how they came up with these ideas,
*07:34.780- 07:35.400* :  starting with a mean.
*07:35.960- 07:39.260* :  I was thinking about how can we break down the border
*07:39.400- 07:41.940* :  between the two countries to create kind of union,
*07:43.020- 07:46.860* :  and after that, I met Hafid, and we decided to launch ESEM.
*07:47.060- 07:50.840* :  And after that, we tried to meet other people,
*07:51.640- 07:53.940* :  and it worked. It was very positive.
*07:54.520- 07:57.720* :  It's like some, you know, we were young and crazy.
*07:58.680- 08:00.940* :  The feeling is good between Hafid and I.
*08:01.260- 08:03.320* :  The podcast is now in projects.
*08:03.320- 08:04.740* :  It's going to be soon released,
*08:04.920- 08:08.680* :  and the idea is to go on the social networks
*08:08.680- 08:10.500* :  and spread good words.
*08:10.800- 08:13.760* :  It's to say, look, a Moroccan and Algerian
*08:13.760- 08:16.800* :  that are very good friends and talking in depth about the topics
*08:17.260- 08:20.360* :  would bring an immense positive news to people,
*08:20.780- 08:24.460* :  rather than what we can see on the social networks, unfortunately.
*08:25.060- 08:27.840* :  Because, as a journalist myself, who was in Morocco,
*08:27.840- 08:31.360* :  I've always been aware that there's been some political tension.
*08:31.820- 08:34.180* :  It goes back to the days of the Cold War,
*08:34.500- 08:37.260* :  when Algeria was backed by the Soviet Union,
*08:37.500- 08:39.860* :  and Morocco was allied to the United States.
*08:40.500- 08:42.840* :  In 1963, there was even a border war.
*08:43.500- 08:47.740* :  And even today, there's arguments over the territory of Western Sahara.
*08:48.580- 08:51.220* :  So, are you guys trying to move away from that
*08:51.500- 08:55.240* :  and see sort of more of a human connection between Moroccans and Algerians?
*08:55.500- 08:58.720* :  I had the occasion last year during a trip to Ujda.
*08:59.820- 09:01.740* :  It's probably the longest closed border in the world
*09:02.500- 09:03.420* :  between the both countries.
*09:04.500- 09:07.020* :  But when you go there, you don't feel there is a closed border.
*09:07.500- 09:10.460* :  You meet Algerians in Ujda, everyone in this city
*09:10.800- 09:13.280* :  have a family in the other side of the border.
*09:13.580- 09:16.900* :  What is amazing, there is a cliff where you can go and stand on
*09:17.500- 09:21.360* :  and see just the other side, every moment of the day,
*09:21.500- 09:24.600* :  there are people cheering, showing the kids to the other side
*09:24.600- 09:27.020* :  of the family that lives on the other country.
*09:27.500- 09:31.140* :  And sometimes even bringing musicians and making parties
*09:31.640- 09:32.940* :  on both sides of the border.
*09:33.340- 09:37.760* :  And you feel really that is a normal loss to have this closed border.
*09:37.760- 09:41.600* :  And it would really change the face of this eastern-most region,
*09:41.600- 09:45.520* :  western-most of Algeria if it happens to be open one day.
*09:45.520- 09:48.040* :  I hope we're going to witness that during our lifetime.
*09:48.560- 09:51.720* :  And I mean, I understand that you're so passionate about
*09:51.720- 09:55.740* :  bringing different countries in the Maghreb in North Africa together
*09:55.740- 09:58.600* :  that you've been climbing mountains. Can you tell us about that?
*09:58.920- 10:02.060* :  I started climbing mountains in 2019 to celebrate
*10:02.060- 10:06.480* :  the first few years of the United Maghreb.
*10:06.800- 10:09.920* :  After that, I decided to add a small touch of craziness
*10:09.920- 10:10.980* :  in this challenge.
*10:11.000- 10:14.480* :  I committed to conquering the Seven Semits Challenge.
*10:14.500- 10:18.340* :  In each continent you have the highest peak in Africa
*10:18.340- 10:20.220* :  is Kilimanjaro. I started by this.
*10:20.740- 10:23.240* :  Then I moved to South America.
*10:24.080- 10:28.200* :  I prepared a kind of flag, which is a heart.
*10:28.900- 10:31.480* :  And inside a heart, we have the two flags of Morocco
*10:31.480- 10:33.360* :  and Algeria together.
*10:33.900- 10:36.400* :  My goal is to infer a banner.
*10:36.720- 10:38.400* :  This banner of Maghreb united.
*10:39.120- 10:41.380* :  And do you guys also follow football?
*10:41.440- 10:43.380* :  So if Algeria are doing well,
*10:43.800- 10:47.420* :  Hafida used supportive of Algeria and vice versa.
*10:47.840- 10:50.480* :  Or do you guys tease each other about the rival football teams?
*10:50.500- 10:53.060* :  Well, I remember in 2019,
*10:53.560- 10:56.980* :  there was the Africa Cup where Algeria won the Cup.
*10:57.400- 10:59.940* :  It was a crazy moment because in Morocco,
*11:00.380- 11:04.180* :  as if nothing ever happened politically between Morocco and Algeria,
*11:04.540- 11:06.980* :  people just spontaneously supported Algeria.
*11:07.320- 11:09.320* :  And I remember even t-shirts were written,
*11:09.320- 11:12.120* :  if I am a Moroccan, means I am Algerian.
*11:12.120- 11:16.760* :  It was very emotional moment that streets were full of people holding,
*11:16.760- 11:19.060* :  carrying Moroccan flag, Algerian flag.
*11:19.700- 11:21.560* :  We danced in the street with people.
*11:21.560- 11:23.040* :  It was so positive.
*11:23.500- 11:24.000* :  And I remember that.
*11:24.500- 11:26.560* :  Morocco did very well in the recent World Cup,
*11:28.480- 11:28.520* :  didn't they?
*11:28.520- 11:28.840* :  Were you cheering on the Moroccan team?
*11:29.500- 11:30.120* :  It was crazy.
*11:30.820- 11:32.920* :  No more suspicion, no more animosity.
*11:32.920- 11:35.260* :  The heart of the Maghreb was beating again.
*11:35.840- 11:39.400* :  Amin Buhasan and her feed Bouteleb talking to Richard Hamilton.
*11:41.160- 11:44.560* :  Waterproof trousers, thermal layers and a sporting attitude.
*11:45.200- 11:48.440* :  A US rowing team is prepared for most eventualities
*11:48.440- 11:51.040* :  when they train in California's choppy waters.
*11:51.780- 11:53.740* :  But when the team went to practice recently,
*11:54.380- 11:55.800* :  there was a surprise visitor.
*11:56.540- 11:58.060* :  Madeline Drury has this report.
*12:01.980- 12:04.480* :  It was a grey day in California's Marina Del Rey.
*12:05.040- 12:07.480* :  Logan Hibbid, a rower from the UCLA sports team,
*12:07.480- 12:11.140* :  spots a slim grey outline bobbing around her.
*12:11.740- 12:14.120* :  Two large dark eyes stared back.
*12:16.100- 12:17.480* :  It was a sea lion.
*12:18.000- 12:19.200* :  She just hopped right in.
*12:19.500- 12:21.480* :  It was kind of like you didn't really know what was going on.
*12:21.480- 12:22.560* :  It's all he was in the boat.
*12:22.960- 12:24.500* :  But that doesn't scare Logan.
*12:24.500- 12:27.900* :  In fact, she and other rowers grabbed phones to take pictures.
*12:28.360- 12:31.360* :  She just kind of fell asleep and he took a little nap on my light.
*12:31.360- 12:33.800* :  If he was like to sleep for a little bit and then he would wake up.
*12:34.200- 12:36.740* :  The pup was happy to sit in the boat for about 50 minutes
*12:36.740- 12:38.700* :  and the team rode back to shore.
*12:39.260- 12:43.240* :  But upon arriving on dry land, the sea lion appeared to act strangely.
*12:43.920- 12:46.220* :  And he was just walking around kind of in circles on the dock.
*12:46.800- 12:47.820* :  You know, just like spinning.
*12:47.820- 12:50.820* :  So that's when you can really tell the person something wrong with him.
*12:50.820- 12:53.560* :  The Marine Mammal Care Center run their tests.
*12:54.100- 12:55.920* :  The sea lion is less than a year old.
*12:55.920- 12:58.480* :  They found and is suffering from malnutrition.
*12:59.160- 13:01.280* :  These animals are not drawn to people.
*13:01.500- 13:04.240* :  That's John Warner, the chief executive of the care center.
*13:04.700- 13:10.380* :  The circumstances drew that animal to one's safety out of the water,
*13:10.740- 13:13.340* :  probably given the condition it was in.
*13:13.980- 13:16.940* :  The pup is now recovering, with help from John's team.
*13:17.500- 13:20.140* :  And after rowing to the rescue, Logan is optimistic.
*13:20.680- 13:24.040* :  I just hope that he is able to fully recover eventually and hopefully go back.
*13:24.720- 13:25.220* :  Where he belongs.
*13:29.260- 13:29.740* :  What a treat.
*13:30.800- 13:33.880* :  Logan Hibbert ending that report by Madeline Jury.
*13:35.420- 13:38.940* :  He may have heard our next story on the Global News Podcast last week.
*13:39.620- 13:44.280* :  It's about a potentially groundbreaking new treatment which could help people across the world
*13:44.280- 13:47.620* :  restore movements to parts of their bodies which have been paralyzed.
*13:48.680- 13:54.340* :  It involves a non-invasive device which sends electrical pulses to areas of the spinal cord.
*13:55.200- 13:59.960* :  After a successful trial across the world, the team is applying for regulatory approval
*14:00.280- 14:03.940* :  to use their system to treat patients and hospitals in the United States.
*14:05.040- 14:07.980* :  Melanie Reed, a journalist at the Times of London here in Britain,
*14:07.980- 14:09.140* :  took part in the study.
*14:09.820- 14:12.680* :  In 2010, Melanie fell off her horse.
*14:13.220- 14:15.340* :  She broke her neck and fractured her lower back.
*14:15.900- 14:17.240* :  She was 52 at the time.
*14:18.060- 14:22.000* :  The happy pods Holly Gibbs spoke to Melanie about why she took part in the study
*14:22.680- 14:25.980* :  and why, since the accident, she's always maintained hope.
*14:26.760- 14:30.620* :  My sort of dream has always had to be able to have a bit more use from my left hand.
*14:30.880- 14:34.820* :  And I was given the opportunity to participate and I just thought,
*14:34.820- 14:35.880* :  it wouldn't be wonderful.
*14:36.500- 14:38.960* :  Even though I'm a chronic injury, I've had it for so long.
*14:39.500- 14:45.400* :  It wouldn't be wonderful if I could regain a little bit of grip and strength in my left thumb.
*14:45.700- 14:48.020* :  Able-bodied people never think about these things.
*14:48.700- 14:51.300* :  But if you don't have a thumb, you really can't do very much.
*14:51.500- 14:52.480* :  You can't pick stuff up.
*14:52.680- 14:55.340* :  And thumbs are really, really, really important.
*14:56.100- 14:59.000* :  And how has it been getting more movement back?
*14:59.500- 15:01.900* :  And what can you do now that you weren't able to do before?
*15:02.680- 15:08.520* :  It's very important to say at the outset that there are no miracles in spinal injury.
*15:08.860- 15:12.580* :  You know, it's one of the last great unsolved frontiers of medicine.
*15:12.780- 15:17.760* :  And so I've been injured long enough to be fairly cynical about all the claims
*15:17.880- 15:21.740* :  and it's a long, hard grind, scientific grind.
*15:22.580- 15:25.200* :  For me, it's really increased my function.
*15:25.500- 15:29.140* :  I can scroll a tablet or a smartphone with it.
*15:29.720- 15:32.740* :  I can release my seatbelts in the car with my thumb.
*15:33.040- 15:37.620* :  It's hard work, but I can now put my own hair up on the back of my head.
*15:37.680- 15:40.920* :  Put it in a ponytail, which I couldn't do before.
*15:40.920- 15:45.380* :  I think the great hope is that for young people, for newly injured people,
*15:46.280- 15:53.060* :  in a hospital situation, those people will be able to get the device on their necks
*15:53.240- 15:56.100* :  and it will keep the nerves firing.
*15:56.100- 15:58.680* :  It will keep some kind of connectivity going.
*15:58.680- 16:02.840* :  And it will stop the formation of scar tissue.
*16:03.260- 16:08.040* :  Does it give you hope for the future of people with similar conditions like you
*16:08.040- 16:10.680* :  that they will be able to get more movement back?
*16:11.020- 16:14.800* :  I always have hope. You have to have hope in this condition.
*16:15.480- 16:17.160* :  Without hope medicine means nothing.
*16:17.960- 16:20.020* :  It's amazing that you are so positive.
*16:20.440- 16:22.480* :  Considering your injury and everything you've been through,
*16:22.480- 16:26.480* :  it's amazing that you still have such a positive outlook on the future
*16:26.480- 16:29.960* :  and other people that could find themselves in similar situations like you.
*16:30.380- 16:33.940* :  You have to be. It's grim. It's really grim.
*16:34.000- 16:39.360* :  Your life explodes. It's like a nuclear explosion that blows your life apart.
*16:40.180- 16:42.220* :  Your head can go down and you can give up,
*16:42.260- 16:46.040* :  or you can decide to make as good a life as you can.
*16:46.040- 16:47.420* :  And you do it for the people you love.
*16:48.340- 16:50.980* :  And yeah, we've all got to be hopeful.
*16:51.880- 16:55.200* :  Keep being happy and keep smiling and keeping positive.
*16:56.140- 16:58.280* :  Melanie Reed speaking to Holly Gibbs.
*17:03.860- 17:09.460* :  Coming up in this podcast, we meet the group trying to save sea turtles in El Salvador.
*17:10.040- 17:16.140* :  We try to teach them that they have to take care not just of the sea turtles,
*17:16.260- 17:22.800* :  but also the whole environment, like taking care of where they throw the plastic.
*17:32.940- 17:36.300* :  Many of us have those stubborn pounds that seem impossible to lose,
*17:36.480- 17:39.500* :  no matter how good we eat or how hard we work out.
*17:39.920- 17:41.520* :  My solution is plush care.
*17:41.960- 17:43.920* :  Plush care is a leading telehealth provider,

*18:37.580- 18:40.560* :  Now, we've all heard phrases like good vibrations.
*18:41.360- 18:43.640* :  But how much power does a vibration have?
*18:44.440- 18:46.900* :  According to experts in sound therapy, a lot.
*18:47.700- 18:51.140* :  The practice, which uses healing sounds and special instruments
*18:51.140- 18:54.400* :  has its roots in almost every ancient civilization.
*18:55.220- 18:56.620* :  But it's become so mainstream.
*18:56.620- 18:59.840* :  It's now found at events, musical festivals,
*19:00.500- 19:01.820* :  and in homes around the world.
*19:02.620- 19:05.420* :  Wilderness in the English countryside is one festival
*19:05.420- 19:10.160* :  that's bought in some of the pioneers of modern sound therapy for this year's event.
*19:10.900- 19:13.140* :  Stephanie Prentice went to meet them as they warmed up.
*19:23.220- 19:26.740* :  I've walked into a bright, white and airy room in London
*19:26.740- 19:32.000* :  and it's full of giant gongs, crystal bowls, native American flutes.
*19:32.220- 19:35.440* :  And I'm here to experience sound therapy.
*19:37.060- 19:38.780* :  Today I've been told to set an intention
*19:38.780- 19:41.140* :  and then see how I feel at the end.
*19:41.140- 19:44.680* :  So with me as chair of leading the session and she's going to tell me
*19:44.700- 19:47.180* :  what kind of intentions do people tend to set?
*19:47.880- 19:50.440* :  Letting go, anything that no longer serves them,
*19:50.740- 19:53.540* :  wanting to magnetise in new opportunities and experiences
*19:54.220- 19:57.940* :  and overall just wanting to rebalance and re-calibrate to a state of calm.
*19:58.440- 20:01.220* :  Well I live in London so I'm going to choose to re-calibrate
*20:01.220- 20:04.580* :  and return to a state of calm and I'll report back on how that goes.
*20:06.660- 20:09.640* :  On the surface, sound healing involves laying down,
*20:09.640- 20:13.960* :  maybe under a blanket and breathing slowly while listening to the instruments.
*20:15.720- 20:19.720* :  Beneath the surface, proponents say the vibrations affect the body
*20:19.720- 20:24.620* :  on a cellular level, improving brain, nerve, muscle and organ function.
*20:25.700- 20:28.920* :  Cherub and her business partner Tim Wheeter call themselves
*20:28.920- 20:34.500* :  the pioneers of sound therapy after Tim helped bring it to the west in the early 80s.
*20:34.980- 20:38.960* :  It's fundamentally a natural high but that's really what happens.
*20:39.000- 20:41.020* :  People just get high from it.
*20:45.540- 20:48.520* :  We just did a mini session there and I felt myself relaxing.
*20:48.660- 20:51.020* :  I felt quite tingly, I could find myself beaming.
*20:51.020- 20:54.220* :  There's a smile on my face the whole time but are there other things
*20:54.220- 20:55.280* :  that this can be good for?
*20:55.560- 20:58.060* :  Over the years we've experienced everything from it,
*20:58.100- 21:01.200* :  helping with things like Parkinson's, memory recall,
*21:01.440- 21:05.380* :  helping people to have these temporary shifts from left brain to right brain dominance
*21:05.780- 21:07.060* :  so people become more creative.
*21:07.360- 21:09.540* :  Going beyond even what we're playing as instruments,
*21:09.740- 21:13.220* :  I believe not a CATS per, is a particular frequency
*21:13.220- 21:15.340* :  which is 50 vibrations per second.
*21:15.340- 21:18.280* :  Now that helps to mend breaks and fractures and bones.
*21:18.960- 21:20.640* :  So that is how powerful sound is.
*21:21.460- 21:23.320* :  What is actually happening on a physical level?
*21:23.320- 21:26.420* :  It's actually affecting, believe it or not, the water content in your body,
*21:26.420- 21:30.180* :  the blood, everything running through the body is vibrating in sympathy
*21:30.180- 21:31.800* :  with the sound that's being created.
*21:32.480- 21:36.420* :  As a giro, they've travelled all over the world from chamony to China
*21:36.880- 21:39.740* :  and worked for everyone from celebrities to scientists.
*21:40.560- 21:43.460* :  But one of their favourite things is music festivals
*21:43.460- 21:47.300* :  where they say a good sound session can power people up,
*21:47.660- 21:48.860* :  starting with wilderness.
*21:49.580- 21:53.360* :  That's probably going to give them another 12 hours of festival party
*21:53.360- 21:56.940* :  because it's helped to rebound and recalibrate them at the cellular level.
*22:00.700- 22:02.760* :  I've stepped outside into the London streets
*22:02.920- 22:07.700* :  and I have to say I do feel calmer, I do feel lighter.
*22:08.660- 22:11.660* :  And while sound therapy might not be for everyone,
*22:12.120- 22:14.520* :  my conclusion is it probably can't hurt to try.
*22:19.760- 22:23.500* :  Stephanie Prentice and she's still floating around the happy pod office.
*22:24.480- 22:27.600* :  And we should say that while scientific research seems to show
*22:27.840- 22:32.040* :  some evidence supporting sound therapy's benefit for mental and physical health,
*22:32.600- 22:36.060* :  there have been no reviews of randomised controlled trials.
*22:37.640- 22:41.920* :  To El Salvador now, and some good news for a critically endangered species,
*22:42.920- 22:46.740* :  Hawksbill sea turtles are what's known as a keystone species
*22:47.340- 22:50.640* :  because they're crucial to maintaining the health of the world's oceans.
*22:51.480- 22:56.080* :  They help protect coral reefs by eating things that prey on them like sponges.
*22:56.580- 23:00.900* :  They also transfer essential nutrients from beaches to coastal dunes.
*23:01.480- 23:04.700* :  But they're under threat from a loss of habitats like reefs
*23:05.180- 23:06.660* :  and because people eat their eggs.
*23:07.580- 23:11.420* :  One group, Pro Costa, has had success in trying to save them
*23:11.860- 23:13.760* :  as Jane Chambers went to find out.
*23:14.520- 23:17.260* :  I went to visit them in a place called Hickey-Lisco Bay
*23:17.260- 23:19.580* :  which is on the Pacific coast of El Salvador.
*23:20.260- 23:24.220* :  And one of their most important solutions is working with people in the local community.
*23:24.780- 23:27.900* :  I went to meet its executive director, Annie Enriquez.
*23:28.760- 23:31.380* :  We have a network of...
*23:31.380- 23:35.200* :  we said carieros, which are community members that are helping us, conserving it.
*23:35.680- 23:38.760* :  And these people that used to sell eggs,
*23:39.180- 23:40.760* :  now they're working for conservation.
*23:40.920- 23:44.660* :  So now, whenever they see a nasty turtle they call us,
*23:45.000- 23:48.120* :  and then we have an incentive for the community,
*23:48.680- 23:50.480* :  which is helping also their families.
*23:51.200- 23:53.340* :  So instead of earning money from selling eggs,
*23:53.360- 23:58.060* :  the community can be paid up to $30 USD per nest to protect them.
*23:58.580- 24:02.780* :  In the world, there are seven species of turtugas marinas.
*24:03.340- 24:06.120* :  Another part of the solution is educating the next generation.
*24:06.680- 24:10.560* :  Making them care about the turtles is also key to their future survival.
*24:11.120- 24:14.880* :  Hello, I am Melissa Baye, I am Veterinarian.
*24:16.600- 24:20.980* :  Melissa is on the shore of La Pereira Island playing a game with some of the local children.
*24:20.980- 24:24.500* :  She tells the older ones some facts about the local turtle population.
*24:25.020- 24:28.140* :  And with the younger children they learn about how the turtles lay the eggs.
*24:28.580- 24:31.940* :  They dig a hole in the sand with their feet acting like the turtle's blipper
*24:32.300- 24:34.880* :  and then cover the pretend turtle eggs.
*24:35.440- 24:41.480* :  We try to teach them that they have to take care not just of the sea turtles,
*24:41.480- 24:43.920* :  but also the whole environment,
*24:43.920- 24:49.280* :  like taking care of where they throw the plastic or the garbage,
*24:49.920- 24:53.220* :  trying to reduce the consumption of plastic.
*24:55.860- 24:59.320* :  The pro-coster team has discovered that if the temperature of the sand
*24:59.320- 25:01.700* :  where the turtles lay their eggs is too high,
*25:01.700- 25:04.860* :  they get more female turtles and not enough male ones.
*25:04.920- 25:08.960* :  There are two hatcheries where they have staff working in shifts around the clock,
*25:08.960- 25:13.140* :  and each nest of eggs is cordoned off, clearly marked and closely monitored.
*25:14.080- 25:16.460* :  Annie took me on a boat to the El Confinn hatchery,
*25:16.660- 25:20.100* :  which is on a remote tiny island at the mouth of the Pacific Ocean.
*25:20.660- 25:22.880* :  She introduced me to Gerardo Crespo,
*25:22.900- 25:24.800* :  who's been working there for the last six years.
*25:28.380- 25:33.040* :  We keep the thermometer in this box to measure the temperature every six hours.
*25:33.940- 25:39.060* :  We use host pipes to spray the sand with water to cool it down if it's getting too hot.
*25:39.620- 25:43.780* :  In 2007, conservationists thought the population was nearing extinction,
*25:43.780- 25:48.640* :  now due to pro-coster their partners' wild earth allies and the local community.
*25:48.640- 25:52.720* :  They managed to protect around 98% of the nest each season,
*25:53.180- 25:55.240* :  and more nests have been reported every year.
*25:55.580- 25:58.480* :  During the nesting season, the team were on call 24-7
*25:58.480- 26:00.260* :  to help when the turtle eggs hatch.
*26:00.960- 26:02.360* :  How do you feel when they hatch?
*26:05.920- 26:10.340* :  It's so exciting. The sand starts moving as the tiny turtles
*26:10.460- 26:12.280* :  make their way towards the surface.
*26:13.100- 26:15.480* :  Turtle rescue worker, Heraldo Crespo,
*26:16.220- 26:18.060* :  ending that report by Jane Chambers.
*26:18.660- 26:23.780* :  And you can hear more about the project and others tackling the effects of climate change in El Salvador

*26:29.160- 26:33.740* :  We've been asking for your stories of meeting people you know in unexpected places.
*26:34.680- 26:38.260* :  Last week we heard from Leo who saw his family friend from Zimbabwe
*26:38.680- 26:40.840* :  at a train station in Maidenhead in England.
*26:41.780- 26:43.300* :  One of our colleagues, Peter Hyatt,
*26:43.560- 26:45.920* :  heard us talking about chance encounters the other day,
*26:46.480- 26:47.580* :  and gave us his own tale.
*26:48.480- 26:51.780* :  It was December 1986, and I was taking a break from my duties
*26:51.780- 26:55.900* :  at the BBC's Jakarta correspondent to spend a little time with my then-girlfriend
*26:56.280- 26:57.900* :  who'd flown over from London for Christmas.
*26:59.000- 27:02.180* :  We were in a little fishing port on the northwest coast of the island of Lombok,
*27:02.480- 27:03.700* :  the next one down from Bali.
*27:04.640- 27:07.220* :  We wanted to get to a tiny island called Gili Tcharangan
*27:07.820- 27:11.480* :  where we'd heard that the warm and clear waters offered wonderful snorkeling.
*27:11.940- 27:14.540* :  This was years before commercial tourism arrived in Lombok,
*27:15.000- 27:17.720* :  and it's hard to overstate how isolated the region was.
*27:18.340- 27:20.240* :  There was no regular service to Gili Tcharangan.
*27:20.880- 27:23.620* :  You just had to hope that a passing fishing boat would sell you the ride.
*27:24.540- 27:28.460* :  As we waited in our ruthless Jeep for a boat to arrive, rain started falling.
*27:29.180- 27:31.160* :  So we sought shelter in the harbourside cafe.
*27:32.020- 27:36.300* :  Where we were surprised to notice two other foreigners also waiting for a boat to Gili Tcharangan.
*27:37.020- 27:40.480* :  And even more surprised when they turned out to be a former World Service colleague,
*27:40.840- 27:42.500* :  Stuart, and his wife Margaret.
*27:43.440- 27:47.480* :  Stuart had left the BBC a year or so previously to accompany Margaret to Malaysia,
*27:48.120- 27:50.980* :  where she had a job as an entomologist with the Sabba Foundation.
*27:51.920- 27:56.200* :  Her job was to track and record the number and variety of insects in the Virgin Rainforest.
*27:57.200- 27:59.920* :  They were taking a brief holiday before returning to the Rainforest
*28:00.320- 28:02.180* :  and hadn't wanted to travel very far.
*28:02.900- 28:07.080* :  The waters were indeed clear and warm as promised, but we didn't stay long.
*28:08.120- 28:11.920* :  Margaret's professional expertise enabled her the next morning to identify
*28:11.920- 28:15.860* :  and name the type of beetle we found lurking in our breakfast banana porridge.
*28:16.860- 28:17.820* :  We left within the hour.
*28:18.780- 28:20.100* :  Delicious or not.
*28:20.920- 28:22.820* :  Our very own Peter Hyatt.

*29:17.820- 29:19.080* :  A buddy of mine got into the dime.

*29:27.900- 29:29.000* :  We lost everything.
*29:29.660- 29:32.920* :  And to date, no one has been brought to justice.
*29:33.520- 29:34.960* :  Somebody knows more than we know.
*29:35.360- 29:37.480* :  The six billion dollar gold scam.
