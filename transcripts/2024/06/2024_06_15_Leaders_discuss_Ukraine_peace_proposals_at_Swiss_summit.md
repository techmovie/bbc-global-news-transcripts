*00:35.700- 00:40.240* :  Boring. No flavor. That was as bad as those leftovers you ate all week.
*00:40.400- 00:44.960* :  Kick your bummer here, and it's time to say hello to something fresh and guilt-free.

*01:04.180- 01:07.780* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.700- 01:13.260* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Sunday the 16th of June,
*01:13.260- 01:18.440* :  these are our main stories. A conference is underway in Switzerland to try to find a path to
*01:18.440- 01:24.000* :  peace in Ukraine. An investigation is underway into the deaths of eight Israeli soldiers in
*01:24.000- 01:29.320* :  Raffa in Gaza. There's been an exchange of prisoners between Sweden and Iran.
*01:32.100- 01:32.880* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:42.960- 01:47.540* :  at Trooping the Colour the Princess of Wales makes her first official appearance
*01:47.540- 01:52.700* :  since being diagnosed with cancer, and the teenage mass genius in China
*01:53.140- 01:54.220* :  who is self-taught.
*01:58.800- 02:04.220* :  In this Swiss resort of Bergenstock, representatives from 90 countries are trying to find a path
*02:04.220- 02:09.940* :  towards peace in Ukraine, 28 months after Russia's invasion of its neighbour.
*02:10.540- 02:13.260* :  Russia hasn't been invited to the peace summit, and China,
*02:13.260- 02:17.340* :  the key strategic partner for Vladimir Putin, is also not there.
*02:18.000- 02:22.060* :  The president of the European Commission, Ashilev Wonderland, says failure to act
*02:22.300- 02:24.020* :  will embolden other aggressors.
*02:24.620- 02:30.540* :  Freezing the conflict today with foreign troops occupying Ukrainian land is not an answer.
*02:31.500- 02:35.640* :  In fact, it is a recipe for future wars of aggression.
*02:37.120- 02:45.220* :  Instead, we need to support a comprehensive, just and sustainable piece for Ukraine.
*02:46.480- 02:51.620* :  One that restores Ukraine's sovereignty and its territorial integrity,
*02:52.320- 02:56.640* :  Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, gave an impassioned plea for peace.
*02:57.500- 03:02.220* :  Putin has taken the lives of thousands of our people.
*03:02.220- 03:06.280* :  Why? Because he wants to take over a neighbouring country.
*03:06.700- 03:08.680* :  I do not wish these to anyone.
*03:08.700- 03:14.380* :  I sincerely wish that all of you, all the peoples of the world, every child,
*03:14.380- 03:18.560* :  every family could simply live without war.
*03:18.900- 03:22.620* :  And I want this for all Ukrainians.
*03:22.620- 03:26.940* :  Ukraine had the right to peace, just like all of you.
*03:27.300- 03:30.240* :  But what can the two-day peace summit actually achieve
*03:30.240- 03:35.040* :  after Russia's president Putin demanded Ukraine hand over all four regions
*03:35.040- 03:37.440* :  that Russia claims to have annexed?
*03:37.940- 03:40.960* :  Are Eastern European correspondents Sarah Rainesford is at the summit?
*03:41.600- 03:45.660* :  I'm talking to you now from a point in the mountains above Lake Lustern.
*03:45.780- 03:50.160* :  And I can't think of a place any further removed from what I've seen in Ukraine
*03:50.160- 03:51.660* :  over the past 28 months.
*03:51.780- 03:56.980* :  But this is the beautiful tranquil, secluded spot where world leaders and
*03:56.980- 04:02.720* :  delegations from all over the world are coming together to try to begin a tentative
*04:03.400- 04:07.020* :  but critical process towards peace in Ukraine.
*04:07.260- 04:10.880* :  But it's an extremely complex process as we've already seen today.
*04:10.880- 04:14.520* :  The whole point of this summit is to bring together countries
*04:14.520- 04:17.240* :  not just Ukraine's close allies in the West,
*04:17.240- 04:20.960* :  but also other countries from what's often described as the global south
*04:20.960- 04:26.720* :  who are not necessarily 100% behind Ukraine's plan for peace
*04:27.040- 04:29.340* :  in this route out of this war.
*04:29.760- 04:33.520* :  So a whole diverse group of countries brought together
*04:33.520- 04:38.420* :  to try to hammer out something which might begin to move Ukraine towards peace.
*04:38.420- 04:42.300* :  Of course, that is so critically important for a country where tens of thousands of people
*04:42.300- 04:44.520* :  have been killed so far in this war.
*04:44.540- 04:46.280* :  But as you mentioned, Russia's not here.
*04:46.680- 04:50.300* :  China, Russia's closest ally has also stayed away from this process.
*04:50.980- 04:55.000* :  And therefore, you know, it is difficult to see really how much
*04:55.400- 04:56.720* :  actually can be achieved today.
*04:56.720- 05:01.440* :  But I think the hopes for this process are high because the stakes are so extremely high.
*05:01.940- 05:06.400* :  Sarah, yesterday, President Putin urged Ukraine to hand over four regions
*05:07.440- 05:09.940* :  which Russia claims to have annexed.
*05:09.940- 05:12.400* :  What does that tell us, do you think about Russia's attitude?
*05:13.620- 05:17.760* :  Well, yeah, not just the areas that Russia controls physically on the ground,
*05:17.760- 05:23.820* :  but Putin demanding that Ukraine also see to territory that Russia has claimed as its own
*05:23.820- 05:26.960* :  in the constitution, so the four regions that it's claimed as its own,
*05:27.340- 05:29.460* :  but that the Ukrainian government gave control.
*05:29.460- 05:35.180* :  So a sort of maximalist position by Vladimir Putin, I think trying to disrupt what's
*05:35.180- 05:40.820* :  happening today. I suppose the optimistic reading for Ukraine would be that it's because he's
*05:40.820- 05:44.720* :  worried about what this summit shows, and he wants to disrupt it.
*05:44.980- 05:49.180* :  The other version is that he is simply seeing himself and seeing Russian troops as having
*05:49.180- 05:54.220* :  the advantage on the ground, and he sees no reason now to move towards any kind of compromise.
*05:54.640- 05:58.280* :  Certainly, Ukraine has said, you know, it has no intention of compromising on the key things,
*05:58.280- 06:01.600* :  but interestingly, I have spoken to Ukrainian officials here who have told me
*06:02.000- 06:07.460* :  that if they can hammer out some kind of basic deal here, then ultimately Russia could be invited
*06:08.000- 06:12.580* :  to this process, to a second summit. Sarah Reinsford in Switzerland.
*06:13.300- 06:18.540* :  The Russian journalist Elena Kostyachenko decided to write a book about her country's path
*06:18.540- 06:22.940* :  to war in Ukraine after covering the invasion for the independent Russian newspaper,
*06:22.940- 06:29.140* :  Novaya Gazeta. That book, I Love Russia, has just won this year's Pushkin House Prize,
*06:29.140- 06:33.960* :  which is awarded to the best non-fiction writing on Russia in the English language.
*06:33.980- 06:39.740* :  The authors book to Rebecca Kesby about her experience in Ukraine as a Russian journalist,
*06:40.240- 06:45.240* :  and how she felt witnessing war crimes perpetuated by soldiers from her country.
*06:45.940- 06:52.380* :  I was doing my best as a reporter, but it felt like I'm in some kind of nightmare, and
*06:53.220- 07:01.060* :  I was eager to wake up. Of course, I feel a lot of responsibility for my countrymen,
*07:01.100- 07:09.880* :  for people I grew up with. I was worried that Ukrainians won't speak with me because I am Russian,
*07:11.140- 07:17.380* :  but actually we did speak with me because I am Russian, because they saw me as a chance to
*07:19.000- 07:25.320* :  pass information to other Russian people, so we would know what's really happening in Ukraine,
*07:26.420- 07:33.000* :  what's being done, by Russian soldiers. You enter Mariupol as part of your reporting,
*07:33.000- 07:38.460* :  and tell us what happened to you there, because you got very serious death threats there, didn't you?
*07:38.780- 07:44.440* :  Mariupol was still resisting, it wasn't a copied yet, but it was kind of surrounded by Russian
*07:44.620- 07:49.300* :  troops, and the only occasionally passable road was through Zaparizia.
*07:49.780- 07:54.900* :  Jay before our planned trip, my colleague from Novakazeta approached me, she called me,
*07:54.900- 08:00.720* :  and she asked me if I'm going to Mariupol, and I was quite surprised that she knows about that,
*08:00.720- 08:09.280* :  because only very few people knew. Her sources contacted her, and they told her that they knew that
*08:09.280- 08:16.400* :  I was planning to come to Mariupol, and they had information on me, and they also have an order,
*08:16.400- 08:26.120* :  not to arrest me, not to detain me, but to kill me. I spent one more day in Ukraine because I really
*08:26.120- 08:34.040* :  wanted to go to Mariupol, despite the threats. Journalism was a salvation for me both time. I felt like
*08:34.060- 08:41.840* :  I did what is needed. I just really, really wanted those information as wide known as possible,
*08:41.840- 08:47.640* :  because it was troops of my country. I just want to mention your book, though, the title is I love
*08:47.640- 08:54.120* :  Russia, and I wonder why you called it that and what you want people to understand about your
*08:54.120- 09:02.020* :  Russia and your love for your country. I wanted people to know that Russia is bigger than Putin,
*09:03.000- 09:08.320* :  and when I say about life in Russia, it's more the feeling of belonging, and the
*09:08.320- 09:15.500* :  feeling of belonging actually gives me strength to keep going. Do you see a point where these two
*09:15.500- 09:22.000* :  countries, Russia and Ukraine, can be the friends they once were again? I believe Ukrainians should
*09:22.000- 09:30.740* :  decide that if they will ever be able to, I cannot even say a word for give, because what had happened
*09:30.740- 09:38.740* :  is unforgivable. The riots still relationships over the borders, and walls ties,
*09:38.740- 09:47.720* :  walls connections, they give me hope, but first war has to end. That was Yelena Kostyachenko.
*09:48.720- 09:53.140* :  Now to Israel, where the military there say eight of its troops have been killed in an explosion
*09:53.140- 09:58.200* :  in Rafa in the south of Gaza. In a statement, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*09:58.200- 10:05.900* :  said he was determined to pursue the conflict. Despite the heavy and staggering cost,
*10:05.900- 10:12.600* :  we must dig to the goals of the war, destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas,
*10:12.600- 10:18.820* :  returning all our hostages, making sure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel,
*10:19.400- 10:24.560* :  and returning our residents safely to their homes, both in the north and in the south.
*10:25.160- 10:29.600* :  I asked our Middle East correspondent Yuga Bacheca, who is in Jerusalem, what details have
*10:29.600- 10:35.240* :  emerged about what happened to the soldiers? This is one of the deadliest incidents for the
*10:35.540- 10:40.660* :  Israeli military in this war. The army is saying that this armored vehicle that the soldiers
*10:41.400- 10:48.480* :  were traveling in was hit by a large explosion, and then it appears that this initial blast
*10:48.600- 10:55.120* :  then detonated explosive material in the vehicle, and it was a significant explosion,
*10:55.120- 11:01.580* :  was difficult to identify and locate the bodies. And we soon don't know what trigger the first
*11:01.580- 11:08.160* :  explosion, a spokesman for the military said it was most likely caused by an explosive device in
*11:08.160- 11:15.320* :  the area or by an anti-tank missile. And we know that earlier in the day, the armed wing of Hamas
*11:15.380- 11:21.200* :  claimed to have carried out an attack with an anti-tank missile after setting up an ambush.
*11:21.200- 11:27.380* :  So the deadliest attack for the Israeli military since January, again a very difficult day for
*11:27.380- 11:33.620* :  the Israeli army in Gaza. So Yuga, what do you think this tells us about the remaining strength
*11:33.620- 11:40.280* :  of Hamas after months of this conflict? Well, it shows that despite all the destruction in Gaza,
*11:40.280- 11:47.020* :  despite what the Israeli military has done in terms of trying to destroy the group's infrastructure
*11:47.020- 11:55.120* :  capabilities, they still have the ability to carry out attacks that have a huge impact on the
*11:55.400- 12:00.620* :  Israeli military, reacting to what happened in Gaza, a Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
*12:00.620- 12:05.780* :  he said the country must cling to the goals of destroying Hamas' military and governing
*12:06.300- 12:12.140* :  capabilities. But I think again, lots of questions will be asked about the strategy in Gaza
*12:12.680- 12:18.900* :  and about the goals of the Israeli authorities in Gaza. And why are they concentrating so much
*12:18.900- 12:26.920* :  on Rafa? So this is where the Israeli authority say that Hamas' last remaining battalions are
*12:26.920- 12:33.300* :  based. And for weeks now, this has been the key focus of the Israeli military. And obviously,
*12:33.300- 12:38.420* :  this is where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been sheltering. This has been a very
*12:38.420- 12:45.860* :  slow operation by the Israeli military. If you compare what's happening in Rafa with what happened
*12:45.860- 12:50.940* :  earlier in the war in other parts of Gaza, and obviously the Israeli authorities don't want to
*12:50.940- 12:57.480* :  cross that red line that was imposed by President Biden, who was against the idea of a major
*12:57.480- 13:03.980* :  military operation. But it shows how difficult this has been. And obviously they say that this
*13:04.580- 13:11.120* :  offensive should continue because the goal here is to destroy the infrastructure being used by Hamas.
*13:11.720- 13:17.940* :  Yugo Bachega in Jerusalem. They have survived hell on earth. Those were the words of the Swedish Prime
*13:17.940- 13:23.920* :  Minister, as he welcomed home to Swedish citizens, who had been jailed in Iran on charges widely
*13:23.920- 13:29.680* :  dismissed by the international community. Now, the two countries have conducted a rare prisoner swap.
*13:30.220- 13:35.180* :  In return, for the two Swedes, Sweden has released the Iranian man convicted of murder and war
*13:35.180- 13:40.820* :  crimes. The newsrooms Stephanie Zacherson, till beat how this controversial exchange, came about.
*13:41.560- 13:47.300* :  As is quite common in these types of exchanges, we aren't really told the whole story, the details
*13:47.300- 13:53.880* :  which are mild and secrecy, mainly for security reasons. The government in Oman say they have been
*13:53.880- 13:59.880* :  mediators between Iran and Sweden, which have quite strained relations, especially because of
*13:59.880- 14:05.740* :  these cases of imprisoned Swedish citizens. Sweden's Prime Minister earlier said that it had been
*14:05.740- 14:13.000* :  a dilemma for the government on how to handle this, but he said that they basically had to negotiate
*14:13.000- 14:19.860* :  with Iran because if they didn't, two Swedish citizens would very likely have faced death in Iran.
*14:20.220- 14:25.060* :  So, tell us about those involved in this swap. What's starting with the sweets, the one we know
*14:25.060- 14:31.840* :  most about is 33-year-old Yuan Floderoz, and that is because his family, after a few months of
*14:31.840- 14:38.280* :  what's usually referred to as silent diplomacy, didn't see any progress in getting him released.
*14:38.940- 14:44.060* :  They then decided to go public with his case. He works for the European Union's foreign
*14:44.060- 14:50.700* :  services and was detained in Iran, while he was there on vacation in 2022. He has been
*14:50.700- 14:55.820* :  jailed there in the infamous Evan Prison. He's been accused of espionage, which carries
*14:55.820- 15:01.640* :  death penalty in Iran. An accusation that's been called atrocious and baseless by the Swedish
*15:01.640- 15:07.740* :  government. And the other Swedish citizen sighed as easy. He had been arrested in Iran in November
*15:07.740- 15:14.500* :  last year, and the accusations against him were similarly rejected. Let's listen to what Sweden's
*15:14.500- 15:19.580* :  prime minister of Klystodon said earlier. Iran harfengslapped on board us.
*15:19.720- 15:24.160* :  Iran imprisoned them both to use them as pawns in a cynical negotiations game,
*15:24.160- 15:31.120* :  to get the Iranian citizen Hamid Nuri released from Sweden. He was arrested in 2019 and has been
*15:31.120- 15:37.220* :  sentenced to life in prisons. And Hamid Nuri, he is quite an own figure, isn't he? Indeed,
*15:37.220- 15:44.440* :  Val, he is part of the top level of the Iranian regime, a former judicial official there. He was
*15:44.440- 15:51.140* :  arrested in Sweden in 2019 under international law, as he basically landed at Nairpur in Sweden.
*15:51.620- 15:57.920* :  And over this very long trial, which was very closely watched by Iran, he was in Sweden sentenced
*15:57.920- 16:04.340* :  to life imprisonment for murders and war crimes, crimes against international law. This was because
*16:04.340- 16:10.620* :  of his involvement in the mass killings of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s in Iran,
*16:10.620- 16:17.020* :  on the order of Iran's then supreme leader Ayatollah Khomini. And these executions, they'd never
*16:17.020- 16:23.500* :  even been formally acknowledged by the Iranian establishment. Now Hamid Nuri has landed back in
*16:23.500- 16:29.820* :  Tehran, and he was there welcomed by Iranian top officials. But this decision to release him
*16:29.820- 16:35.680* :  has been slammed as shameful by an exord, Iranian opposition group. The Swedish citizens there
*16:35.680- 16:40.900* :  release has been widely welcomed. Yoan Fadeer's father said he, understandably, was feeling very
*16:40.900- 16:47.420* :  relieved. Stephanie Zakreson. The president of Honduras, Zumara Castro, has announced a raft of
*16:47.420- 16:53.560* :  measures to combat what she described as a security emergency. As Castro also said, a new prison
*16:53.560- 16:59.140* :  will be constructed to hold thousands of people as part of the measures intended to suppress armed
*16:59.140- 17:05.520* :  gangs. This report from Ed Horton. Many of us have seen footage of hundreds of inmates dressed
*17:05.520- 17:12.040* :  only in shorts, with heads bowed sitting on the floor in tight rows, as police search for contraband
*17:12.040- 17:18.660* :  and weapons in a sweep of prisons. Honduras is adopting El Salvador's harsh prison tactics.
*17:19.020- 17:23.440* :  The latest measures announced by the government include the building of a mega prison to hold
*17:23.440- 17:29.600* :  around 20,000 people. The government also wants to reform the penal code, so that members of
*17:29.600- 17:35.360* :  criminal gangs, who commit specific crimes, can be designated as terrorists and face collective
*17:35.360- 17:40.800* :  trials. Honduras has suffered years of gang violence that has made it one of the most violent
*17:40.800- 17:47.260* :  countries in the world, figures say on average 13 people are murdered every day. In June last
*17:47.260- 17:52.640* :  year 46 women were killed during a gruesome settling of scores between gangs at a prison
*17:52.640- 17:58.420* :  northeast of the capital. That massacre sparked outrage across Honduras. It also prompted
*17:58.420- 18:04.180* :  President Castro, who described the violence as the monstrous murder of women, to order sweeping
*18:04.180- 18:10.020* :  changes to the penal system. Along with neighbors El Salvador and Guatemala, Honduras forms
*18:10.020- 18:15.160* :  what has been called Central America's Triangle of Death, plagued by the gangs that control
*18:15.160- 18:20.800* :  drug trafficking and organized crime. In 2022, Honduras declared a state of emergency,
*18:20.800- 18:27.020* :  suspending parts of the Constitution as it sought to bear down on crime. It hoped to copy the success
*18:27.020- 18:32.160* :  of the approach by El Salvador, where the government's harsh policies have led to the murder eight
*18:32.160- 18:37.740* :  dropping dramatically. But at a price, human rights groups complain that police can now carry out
*18:37.740- 18:43.440* :  arrests and searches without warrants. With thousands of innocent people caught up in police sweeps.
*18:47.400- 18:53.040* :  Coming up on the global news podcast. These artworks, while they may be pretty, they have a very
*18:53.040- 18:58.600* :  complicated and horrific history and that history needs to be told. The Swiss Museum which has
*18:58.600- 19:02.380* :  removed paintings from display over Nazi leaching fears.
*19:10.780- 19:16.360* :  Here in Britain, the Princess of Wales has made her first official appearance since being diagnosed
*19:16.360- 19:22.160* :  with cancer and undergoing treatment. Catherine took part together with her family at the annual
*19:22.160- 19:25.660* :  Trooping the Colour, the celebration of King Charles Brusty.
*19:36.840- 19:41.800* :  Our correspondent Charlotte Gallagher was watching the event and told me how the Princess looked.
*19:42.420- 19:46.540* :  She looked incredibly well-viled. I mean, let's be honest, the Princess of Wales always looks
*19:46.540- 19:50.580* :  very well turned out. She's beautiful. She always wears incredible outfits, but she looked
*19:51.080- 19:56.280* :  very, very well. She was wearing a close fitted white dress with a navy trim, sort of almost
*19:56.280- 20:00.000* :  like a nautical theme which matched quite well with what her daughter, Princess Charlotte was wearing.
*20:00.000- 20:05.820* :  I'm sure that was planned and also a wide brimmed hat. She looked elegant as always. She looked like
*20:05.820- 20:10.840* :  she was having fun as well. She was smiling and laughing with her children in the carriage on the
*20:10.840- 20:16.540* :  way to the event. She was waving at the public and also the big moment that people really remember
*20:16.540- 20:21.160* :  for these events is when they step out onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace. They very famous
*20:21.160- 20:26.460* :  balcony at the front and she was waving to the crowd, laughing with King Charles. So I think it was
*20:26.460- 20:32.580* :  an incredibly positive first step from her back into public life. She's taken this time
*20:32.580- 20:38.580* :  away for her treatment. She's still undergoing treatment. This isn't her getting back into the full
*20:38.580- 20:43.500* :  duties, the full schedule of public life because she said she's making good progress, but she's not
*20:43.500- 20:48.600* :  out of the woods yet. And she said yesterday that people who've undergone chemotherapy will understand
*20:48.600- 20:53.080* :  that you have these good days where you want to get out and make the most of feeling well,
*20:53.080- 20:57.820* :  but you also have those bad days where you need to rest and you need to recuperate at home
*20:58.140- 21:02.420* :  and listen to your body. So does that mean we won't know when she's going to appear again,
*21:02.420- 21:07.240* :  except perhaps a couple of days ahead, so actually on the day. I think that's right, Val. I think
*21:07.240- 21:12.260* :  they're not going to be issuing calendars of events that she will be attending. I think it will be
*21:12.260- 21:17.040* :  decisions made pretty much on a day-to-day basis. And that's how it was for the King when he
*21:17.040- 21:22.520* :  started to make his reentry into public life. He also, of course, has been treated for cancer.
*21:22.940- 21:27.800* :  And he has been attending events. He went to D-Day, troopsing the colour. He was at Chelsea Flower Show,
*21:27.800- 21:32.620* :  a society event in London, but he hasn't been doing those full calendar of events. So I think it's
*21:32.620- 21:38.320* :  a very gradual process, obviously for Catherine and her family and the people that look after the
*21:38.320- 21:43.860* :  royal family. The priority is her health and recuperating from this. Charlotte Gallagher.
*21:44.680- 21:49.560* :  In just over a month, athletes from around the world will converge on the French capital for
*21:49.560- 21:55.480* :  the Paris Olympics. But because of the invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been banned by the International
*21:55.480- 22:02.380* :  Olympic Committee from sending a national team, as has its ally, Belarus. Some individual sportsmen
*22:02.380- 22:08.380* :  and women will be allowed to take part, but not under the state flag. The first 25 athletes
*22:08.380- 22:13.180* :  from Russia and Belarus have been cleared to compete with others failing the vetting process
*22:13.180- 22:18.740* :  because of their stance on the war in Ukraine. John Goodbody, the Olympics reporter for the
*22:18.740- 22:25.180* :  Sunday Times, describes how the system works. The first thing to be absolutely clear is there is
*22:25.180- 22:33.940* :  no Russian team going. In other words, in sports such as football or basketball, there will be
*22:33.940- 22:39.900* :  no Russian team, nor will they be in a relay in the Russian team. Some Russians will compete
*22:39.900- 22:48.960* :  in some sports, and that depends on a variety of criteria. One of them is whether the
*22:48.960- 22:54.740* :  international governing body, who are responsible for all the individual sports,
*22:55.440- 23:02.940* :  are going to allow competitors from Russia to take part. And will the athletics under the
*23:02.940- 23:10.040* :  presidency of Sebastian Ko are banning any Russian or Belarusian from taking part in the game?
*23:10.040- 23:15.000* :  But there are some individual sports where there will be Russian competitors,
*23:15.680- 23:22.580* :  although they will not be able to say they are Russian competitors, they are neutral athletes.
*23:22.580- 23:28.500* :  John Goodbody, with the US election just months away, there's concern that some politicians
*23:28.500- 23:35.300* :  could use anti-LGBTQ plus rhetoric as part of their campaign. Many of those groups are concerned
*23:35.300- 23:40.900* :  that could increase attacks on members of their community. As a result, some people have decided
*23:40.900- 23:47.080* :  to attend self-defense classes in order to protect themselves. Sophie Williams reports from one class
*23:47.080- 23:57.860* :  in Washington. It's only June here in the US, but according to the American Civil Liberties Union,
*23:57.860- 24:05.360* :  there are already more than 500 anti-LGBT bills working their way through state legislatures.
*24:05.920- 24:10.700* :  They target issues like gender affirming care and public school curriculums,
*24:11.100- 24:16.740* :  including controlling discussions around sexuality. With the number of these bills rising,
*24:16.740- 24:23.860* :  there are growing concerns about the safety of LGBT people, especially after a number of attacks
*24:23.860- 24:29.460* :  on transgender people. We know that hate crimes against LGBTQ people remain incredibly high.
*24:29.480- 24:35.540* :  They are merely the same rates as hate crimes committed against people because of their race or
*24:35.540- 24:41.220* :  their religion. That's Naomi Goldberg from the Movement Advancement Project. Particularly for
*24:41.220- 24:46.560* :  transgender women of color, black and Latina, as well as Native American transgender women,
*24:46.560- 24:51.880* :  there has been really incredibly high rates of violence in particular in some cities,
*24:52.340- 24:58.820* :  and often those cases go unsolved. And between now and November is a really precarious time.
*24:59.640- 25:11.740* :  We know that the far right uses anti-LGBTQ rhetoric to stoke its base. Stop! Stop! I said stop! I said stop! Stop it!
*25:12.720- 25:18.220* :  I've come here to a self-defense class for members of the LGBT community in Washington, DC.
*25:18.980- 25:23.800* :  M is teaching the class today. A lot of people are really concerned not only because of the political
*25:23.800- 25:30.580* :  rhetoric, but also just like growing far right and white nationalist and fascist groups.
*25:30.580- 25:36.220* :  And I think a lot of people do feel nervous and feel afraid about the kind of like violence
*25:36.220- 25:41.240* :  that people are threatening. I am hearing more and more from people that they just really want to
*25:41.240- 25:46.280* :  bone up on their skills around self-defense and taking care of themselves. Those nice bent knees,
*25:46.380- 25:50.700* :  I love that. Let's not like shatter our own kneecaps. As the class goes on, we learn how to
*25:50.700- 26:00.000* :  establish boundaries, warn people to keep their distance and be firm. And then we're taught
*26:00.000- 26:04.780* :  moves that help push attackers away and disarm them so that we can make our escape.
*26:05.660- 26:11.320* :  At the end of the class, I sit down with some of the attendees. I definitely think that being
*26:11.320- 26:17.560* :  in a circle and being in a space where I'm actively engaging with people, especially with other
*26:17.560- 26:22.660* :  queer people, it felt good. You're here to be yourself and to learn something new.
*26:23.220- 26:27.240* :  Oakley said they decided to join the class due to a higher risk to the community.
*26:27.240- 26:33.020* :  We live in a world right now where the likelihood of confrontation is unfortunately increasing,
*26:33.060- 26:37.940* :  so I wanted to have like the skills to be able to get myself to safety.
*26:38.160- 26:44.080* :  As M says goodbye to the class and sends them on their journey home, what does she think about
*26:44.080- 26:47.820* :  having to teach these classes? People shouldn't be attacking, people,
*26:47.820- 26:53.980* :  trans women should be safe, we should all be safe. And we live in the world, we don't live in
*26:53.980- 26:59.580* :  utopia yet, so let's learn some skills to take care of ourselves. Sophie Williams in Washington.
*27:00.460- 27:04.720* :  One of Switzerland's leading art museums is removing five paintings from display
*27:04.720- 27:10.540* :  while it investigates whether they were looted by the Nazis. The Kunsthaus Zurich said the future
*27:10.540- 27:15.920* :  of the paintings is being discussed with the descendants of former owners. With more details from
*27:15.920- 27:22.000* :  Geneva, his are correspondent Imogen Fuchs. The burla collection has been mired in controversy for
*27:22.000- 27:29.760* :  years. Emil burla was a Swiss arms manufacturer who sold weapons to Nazi Germany. He ended the
*27:29.760- 27:36.860* :  second world war Switzerland's richest man. He also collected art, in particular now priceless
*27:36.860- 27:43.320* :  paintings by the French impressionists. It's long been suspected that some works were looted by
*27:43.320- 27:49.980* :  the Nazis or sold at knockdown prices by Jewish families desperate to escape Germany.
*27:50.820- 27:56.300* :  Now Zurich's Kunsthaus Museum says five paintings will be removed from its collection
*27:56.300- 28:03.260* :  while it works to establish their origins and to find a fair solution for the legal successors
*28:03.260- 28:09.220* :  of their former owners. Switzerland has been slow to address the fact that while it didn't
*28:09.220- 28:15.640* :  fire a shot in the second world war, many of its banks and businesses did profit from it.
*28:16.140- 28:21.780* :  But new guidelines relating to looted art have been introduced as well as a new government
*28:21.780- 28:28.580* :  department devoted to tracing it. Christopher Marinello is the founder of Art Recovery International,
*28:28.620- 28:34.420* :  a private company that specializes in dispute resolution for the international art market.
*28:34.960- 28:38.540* :  He told the BBC the museum needs to acknowledge the history of the paintings.
*28:39.280- 28:44.760* :  These artworks, while they may be pretty, they have a very complicated and horrific history
*28:44.760- 28:50.620* :  and that history needs to be told. They have to be seen in the context of how they got to this
*28:50.620- 28:55.600* :  museum. The people who were murdered, the collections that were built by these either Jewish
*28:55.600- 29:01.020* :  dealers or Jewish collectors and how these paintings were forcibly removed from them,
*29:01.380- 29:06.940* :  meaning in one case of a Renoir that's in this collection, the young girl who is pictured in
*29:06.940- 29:12.660* :  the painting, her entire family was murdered by the Nazis. That story needs to be told.
*29:13.160- 29:16.340* :  Christopher Marinello from Art Recovery International.
*29:17.980- 29:22.680* :  Getting to the finals of an elite maths contest in China is hard enough in itself,
*29:22.700- 29:27.420* :  but what if your grades weren't good enough to go to a top school? And as a result,
*29:27.420- 29:33.540* :  you've had to study the subject in your own time. Well, that's the story for one 17-year-old girl
*29:33.540- 29:37.140* :  in China. Aresha Pacific Editor, Celia Hatten explains.
*29:37.900- 29:43.880* :  Youngping has really stunned China. She's the talk of Chinese social media right now,
*29:43.880- 29:51.020* :  and that's because she ranked very, very high in an elite math competition.
*29:51.300- 29:58.020* :  Youngping is 17 years old. She attends a vocational secondary school. So that's a school that's
*29:58.020- 30:04.080* :  basically meant to repair you for one of China's more lower paying jobs. It's not an academic school.
*30:04.080- 30:09.620* :  She's studying fashion at the school, and she became interested in maths a couple of years ago,
*30:09.620- 30:15.180* :  and started self-studying. A teacher of hers at the vocational school realized that she was
*30:15.180- 30:20.080* :  pretty good at math, and he had studied math himself. He gave her some advanced textbooks,
*30:20.080- 30:26.620* :  and she basically whizzed through them, and now spends all of her spare time studying mathematics.
*30:26.780- 30:34.060* :  She entered into the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition. It's a special competition because
*30:34.060- 30:41.860* :  anybody can enter it. You don't need to have any prior degrees. She entered and she ranked 12 out
*30:41.860- 30:48.040* :  of the 800 people who actually made it into the final. She's the only woman in the top 30. She's
*30:48.040- 30:54.260* :  the only secondary school student to have ever made the final, and she beat out a number of teams
*30:54.260- 30:59.400* :  who had submitted artificial intelligence entries. So she basically beat the computers as well.
*30:59.740- 31:05.680* :  It's extraordinary. So what will happen next? Will she move schools? Well, she's now feeling quite a
*31:05.680- 31:12.160* :  few offers from top universities in China to study mathematics, but it really would be a major
*31:12.160- 31:19.500* :  change of lifestyle for her. She's grown up in quite a poor, quite rural part of China. She was
*31:19.500- 31:25.140* :  attending a school that very few people had ever heard of before now, and she was really preparing
*31:25.140- 31:32.240* :  for a life on a factory floor in a garment or textile factory in China. And Celia, what do you
*31:32.240- 31:37.560* :  think this tells us about the education system in China? I mean, it's very competitive, isn't it?
*31:37.840- 31:41.700* :  I'm pretty unforgiving. Exactly. Unforgiving is the perfect word because
*31:42.060- 31:47.420* :  back when she was 15, Jiang Ping wrote something called the high school entrance examination.
*31:47.580- 31:54.140* :  And she did well in mathematics, but not very well in almost any other subject. And that's why she
*31:54.140- 32:00.300* :  was not allowed to go on and study in a more academic school. Officials in Jiangsu, the province
*32:00.300- 32:07.080* :  where Jiang Ping lives, have been feeling questions about why she wasn't given more of an opportunity.
*32:07.080- 32:12.860* :  And so I think the realization is that there are probably many more people like Jiang Ping in
*32:12.860- 32:18.500* :  China, many more people who are a little bit older than 15 who didn't do so well in that
*32:18.500- 32:23.080* :  crucial high school entrance exam. And people are asking questions about whether that exam is
*32:23.080- 32:29.420* :  unfairly cutting people off and really making too many choices for them at two young and age.
*32:29.840- 32:35.680* :  Celia Hatton. And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the global
