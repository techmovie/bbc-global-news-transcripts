*01:27.020- 01:31.040* :  I'm Alex Richardson and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 5th of June,
*01:31.040- 01:38.120* :  these are our main stories. We are all very grateful to members of the public. Citizens
*01:38.120- 01:43.420* :  have expressed full confidence in the BJP and NDA. It's a victory of unwavering loyalty
*01:43.420- 01:49.240* :  to the Constitution of India. Another term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but not the majority,
*01:49.240- 01:55.420* :  he was expecting. In the US, President Biden announced a new policy on immigration at the border
*01:55.420- 02:01.020* :  with Mexico. The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and opposition leader Kier Stammer have made
*02:01.020- 02:06.320* :  their pitch to voters in the first head-to-head TV debate of the general election.
*02:09.140- 02:15.100* :  Also in this podcast, Switzerland's Air Force pilots prepare to practice take-offs and landings
*02:15.100- 02:25.180* :  on the country's motorway network. We begin with the Indian election. Official results show an
*02:25.180- 02:29.900* :  alliance led by the incumbent Prime Minister will form the next government, but Narendra Modi
*02:30.300- 02:35.960* :  was unable to win a majority for his party, the BJP, with far fewer seats one than the last
*02:35.960- 02:41.940* :  election five years ago. An alliance led by Mr. Modi did win enough seats to allow him to serve
*02:41.940- 02:48.160* :  as Prime Minister for a third term, and for this he was given a hero's welcome as our South Asia
*02:48.160- 02:56.160* :  correspondent Samira Hussein reports from Delhi. As Mr. Modi walked into BJP headquarters,
*02:56.160- 03:02.400* :  supporters roared with excitement, throwing flower petals on the Prime Minister. He took to the podium
*03:02.400- 03:07.600* :  and declared himself Prime Minister once again, thanking the people of India for their support.
*03:09.740- 03:15.220* :  We are all very grateful to members of the public, citizens of expressed full confidence in the BJP
*03:15.220- 03:20.620* :  and NDA. Today's victory is the victory of the world's largest democracy. It's a victory of
*03:20.620- 03:29.500* :  unwavering loyalty to the constitution of India. But Mr. Modi was clear to call this a victory for
*03:29.500- 03:36.580* :  his ruling party the BJP and the NDA, the alliance of parties he needs to be able to form a government.
*03:36.580- 03:41.480* :  The results are a blow for the Prime Minister who rode into the selection campaign,
*03:41.480- 03:47.880* :  expecting a landslide, but a surprise win for the Indian National Congress led by Rahul Gandhi,
*03:47.880- 03:53.440* :  who called this a win for democracy. The country has unanimously and clearly stated,
*03:54.060- 03:59.300* :  we do not want Mr. Narendra Modi to be involved in the running of this country,
*03:59.700- 04:03.820* :  so that is a huge message to Mr. Narendra Modi.
*04:04.280- 04:07.900* :  But it will be a coalition government with a weaker mandate,
*04:08.300- 04:10.260* :  unchartered territory for the Prime Minister.
*04:10.520- 04:15.980* :  Samira Hussein, our South Asia original editor and Barassan Eterarshan says that Mr. Modi
*04:15.980- 04:22.560* :  so powerful for the last 10 years in India will now be forced to make compromises for the first
*04:22.560- 04:30.020* :  time he needs the support of junior partners in the alliance to get the majority in the government,
*04:30.020- 04:37.140* :  to they have already crossed a 272. That means whether he can push through some of the Hindu
*04:37.140- 04:43.040* :  nationalist or extreme right wing agenda as some of the politicians and oppositions would describe
*04:43.040- 04:48.360* :  that. So what happened in the building of a temple for a Hindu god, Ram that happened in the
*04:48.360- 04:54.340* :  previous term, or taking away the special status of the Kashmir region, the triggered widespread
*04:54.340- 05:00.580* :  protest. Now people are talking about how far he can go to implementing a common civil law for
*05:00.580- 05:05.240* :  all the religious communities because India has got personal laws different for Muslims and
*05:05.240- 05:11.660* :  Christians and different communities. So it needs to get a consensus among the coalition partners,
*05:12.220- 05:18.060* :  were also they are not religion-based or right wing political parties. So they may have to have
*05:18.060- 05:23.660* :  a compromise and talking with other political parties. So he might find it difficult and adjusting
*05:23.660- 05:29.760* :  with them on various other issues could be a challenge for him because all along he is in a
*05:29.760- 05:36.840* :  projected himself as a strong man was going to take the India to the next level and the two terms
*05:36.840- 05:43.140* :  he had that's what he was projecting himself as that image now he needs to understand the new
*05:43.140- 05:48.980* :  coalition politics. So which parties is he likely to go into coalition with? There are many parties
*05:48.980- 05:54.340* :  in the coalition, the two major parties, one is a Telugu desan party from the state of Andhra Pradesh
*05:54.760- 06:01.540* :  and also from the state of Bihar, Janadadal United and both were critics of Modi at some point
*06:01.540- 06:07.640* :  in the past 20 years. So it is a very strange combination of political parties coming together.
*06:08.380- 06:14.580* :  But what is interesting to see is how this election even though the Congress party has
*06:15.120- 06:21.740* :  failed to get a majority did not win even the BJP on its own did not get a majority but everyone
*06:21.740- 06:27.420* :  thinks that it is a good for democracy because this is the time when you have a strong opposition
*06:27.420- 06:32.840* :  and parliament because the previously some of the think tanks in western countries called India
*06:33.280- 06:38.880* :  partly free and electoral autocracy. So this is a good day for democracy because all the major
*06:38.880- 06:44.780* :  political parties had something to gloat about. And Barassan at Erosion. Joe Biden has announced
*06:44.780- 06:51.100* :  measures aimed at curbing migrant arrivals at the US-Mexico border. It will stop undocumented
*06:51.100- 06:56.460* :  migrants from receiving asylum but only takes effect when officials decide the southern border
*06:56.460- 07:02.760* :  has been overwhelmed. Speaking in Washington he said the executive action was necessary to regain
*07:02.760- 07:07.740* :  control of the border and he blamed Republicans for the collapse of a bipartisan deal.
*07:08.180- 07:12.980* :  To protect America as a land that welcomes immigrants, we must first secure the border
*07:12.980- 07:20.320* :  and secure it now. The simple truth is there is a worldwide migrant crisis and if the United
*07:20.320- 07:24.820* :  States doesn't secure our border there's no limit to the number of people may try to come here.
*07:25.200- 07:29.920* :  For those who say the steps I've taken are too strict, I say to you that be patient,
*07:30.400- 07:35.180* :  do we nothing is not an option. I got more on the president's announcement from our Washington
*07:36.020- 07:40.600* :  correspondent Nomea Iqbal. President Biden wants to change the political narrative around
*07:40.600- 07:46.240* :  immigration. He really wants to show strength on an issue that we know from the polls, voters
*07:46.240- 07:52.160* :  are unhappy about. What has been announced is that the border will shut if the number of people
*07:52.160- 07:57.240* :  attempting to cross it reaches a certain threshold of two and a half thousand and these new
*07:57.240- 08:01.640* :  measures will take effect immediately. There'll be some exceptions for unaccompanied children
*08:02.180- 08:06.700* :  and Mr Biden has said when the crossings fall back to a daily average there would be this provision
*08:06.700- 08:13.600* :  that allows people to resume their asylum petitions but he's already created you know huge
*08:13.600- 08:18.460* :  controversy with it particularly with a lot of civil liberties groups and they believe that this
*08:18.460- 08:23.100* :  is President Biden lurched into the right. It still needs to go through Congress doesn't it?
*08:23.500- 08:28.360* :  These are executive actions this is sort of like a wish list of what the president wants.
*08:28.580- 08:34.620* :  He still wants to put forward legislation to resolve the crisis on the border and he has been
*08:34.620- 08:40.560* :  pushing unsuccessfully for months to pass a Senate bill and that would toughen border security
*08:40.560- 08:45.280* :  and Mr Biden has said legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security
*08:45.280- 08:51.420* :  and immigration reforms but these executive actions he is hoping that they will but will be taken on
*08:51.420- 08:59.500* :  but he's already facing a lot of legal challenges on this by groups like the ACLU American Civil
*08:59.500- 09:05.680* :  Liberties Union who say that it contravenes the rights of asylum seekers to seek asylum in America.
*09:06.120- 09:09.420* :  Have you essentially been forced into doing this by the Republicans?
*09:09.700- 09:14.200* :  It's a good question and I think a lot of critics will say yes he has that he's lurched to the right
*09:14.360- 09:19.020* :  because the polls show that this is an issue that Americans care about. There was a poll that was
*09:19.020- 09:23.980* :  conducted back in March by the Associated Press that found two thirds of Americans disapprovers
*09:23.980- 09:29.320* :  of his handling of the border and that included about 40% of Democrat voters and so whilst Mr
*09:29.320- 09:34.160* :  Biden has accused the Republicans of weaponizing this I think that there will be plenty on the other
*09:34.160- 09:40.180* :  side who say well he has done the same and one of the criticism that he's really facing over this
*09:40.180- 09:46.300* :  is that in this action he's relying on a presidential authority which was actually set up under
*09:46.300- 09:51.320* :  Donald Trump's administration and basically this is where the president has the authority to suspend
*09:51.320- 09:56.000* :  the entry of any applicants if they find it would be detrimental to the interests of the US.
*09:56.600- 10:01.080* :  Now you might remember that this was used by Donald Trump when he was president to ban immigration
*10:01.080- 10:08.040* :  and travel from several predominantly Muslim countries so he has been accused of basically enacting
*10:08.040- 10:14.940* :  Donald Trump's policies. Nomiya Iqbal. To the US state of Delaware where the first prosecution
*10:14.940- 10:20.000* :  witness has taken the stand in the criminal trial of President Biden's son Hunter on charges
*10:20.000- 10:27.100* :  that he lied about his drug use when he bought a cult revolver in 2018. North America correspondent
*10:27.120- 10:32.640* :  Tom Bateman sent this report from outside the court. While the first opening statement was from
*10:32.640- 10:39.580* :  federal prosecutor Derek Hines and he set out to portray Hunter Biden as a self-confessed
*10:39.940- 10:47.640* :  habitual crack cocaine addict who lied in order to purchase a handgun here in Wilmington,
*10:47.640- 10:54.480* :  Delaware in 2018 and what the prosecution alleges is the Hunter Biden knowingly misled when he
*10:54.480- 10:59.980* :  declared that he wasn't a drug abuser and the prosecution says he clearly knew at the time
*10:59.980- 11:06.920* :  that he was. Mr Hines stood before the jury and the very start of his statement made a clear reference
*11:06.920- 11:12.500* :  to the fact that the person they had to hear these allegations about was the son of the US president.
*11:12.500- 11:18.620* :  Mr Hines saying that no one is above the law it doesn't matter who you are or what your name is.
*11:19.040- 11:24.380* :  Now behind Hunter Biden for the second day key members of the Biden family in the public
*11:24.380- 11:31.720* :  benches among them his stepmother the first lady Jill Biden who was very close to Hunter
*11:32.160- 11:38.560* :  terms of sitting about a meter behind him and the family talking to each other at various points
*11:38.620- 11:46.800* :  during the proceedings. Next up was Mr Biden's lawyer for the defense Abbey Lowell who set out
*11:46.800- 11:52.420* :  to say that this case was all about the detail of what that form actually said and the defense
*11:52.420- 11:59.000* :  argument is that Mr Biden at the time did not regard himself as a user of drugs
*11:59.900- 12:04.500* :  and addicted to illegal drugs because they said he'd been in a rehab clinic in California
*12:05.460- 12:10.020* :  before that period and so when he ticked the box to say he wasn't a drug user that was meant
*12:10.020- 12:15.640* :  honestly and they're asking for the jury in that sense to throw out all of these charges.
*12:16.160- 12:21.020* :  After that we'll be getting into the first witnesses in the case the first among those
*12:21.020- 12:26.920* :  a special agent for the FBI who was put on to the under Biden investigation last year
*12:27.300- 12:32.780* :  and further witnesses due to be called over the course of the next two weeks the length of this
*12:33.140- 12:39.260* :  trial is expected to proceed as for Hunter Biden he denies all three felony counts against it.
*12:40.140- 12:47.120* :  John Bateman from today Wednesday the Swiss Air Force is practicing takeoffs and landings
*12:47.820- 12:53.560* :  on a motorway. As Alison Davis reports with the war in Ukraine and increased tension with Russia
*12:54.020- 12:57.660* :  it's something Swiss motorists are likely to see more of in the future.
*13:03.340- 13:09.620* :  A Swiss Air Force plane taking off from a base in central Switzerland from tomorrow such planes
*13:09.620- 13:16.200* :  will take off from a Swiss motorway. The exercise has its roots in the late 1950s when the Swiss
*13:16.200- 13:22.000* :  Parliament approved the use of several makeshift runways on motorways. During the Cold War
*13:22.000- 13:27.980* :  so-called highway operations became part of standard training activities in parts of Europe
*13:27.980- 13:33.880* :  when the risk of a Soviet attack on NATO air bases could suddenly render them unavailable.
*13:34.240- 13:40.640* :  Since the invasion of Ukraine some other European countries have also again been conducting similar
*13:40.640- 13:47.260* :  exercises. The goal says the Swiss Air Force to prepare crews and pilots to operate away from
*13:47.260- 13:53.360* :  military structures so that in the event of a conflict air defence can be guaranteed
*13:53.360- 14:00.080* :  when bases are out of action. Other though not practical problems like a small matter of central
*14:00.080- 14:06.780* :  crash barriers. Professor Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute is a specialist in
*14:06.780- 14:12.960* :  air power and technology. There are modified sections of motorway which tend to not only have
*14:13.020- 14:18.780* :  kind of central barriers often removed or quickly removable absent overhead lighting.
*14:19.460- 14:23.420* :  They're often wider as well but also most aircraft designed for these operations have
*14:23.420- 14:29.360* :  modifications to make it less likely that they will suck up loose stones and debris that might be
*14:29.360- 14:34.680* :  on a normal road surface. So from tomorrow the journeys of some Swiss motorists will be disrupted
*14:34.680- 14:40.600* :  when a stretch of the A1 motorway near the town of Avonch is closed for 36 hours.
*14:40.600- 14:47.620* :  The purpose of the exercise is also to test that in a conflict if motorways are transformed
*14:47.620- 14:52.520* :  into airfields they can be returned to their original purpose in a matter of hours.
*14:52.900- 14:53.640* :  Alison Davis.
*14:56.460- 15:01.520* :  Coming up. I was just so thrilled for them because I knew they'd been looking for several years
*15:01.520- 15:08.140* :  for a dinosaur. The boys from North Dakota who've made a prehistoric discovery.
*15:17.520- 15:21.540* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless
*15:21.540- 15:26.400* :  companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes and then when I asked
*15:26.400- 15:30.740* :  if raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts they said what the
*15:30.740- 15:35.920* :  **** are you talking about you insane Hollywood ****. So to recap we're cutting the price of Mint

*16:21.940- 16:27.280* :  For the first time since the election was called the leaders of Britain's two main parties have
*16:27.280- 16:33.400* :  gone head-to-head in front of a live TV studio audience. Kirstama who heads the main opposition
*16:33.400- 16:39.060* :  Labour Party faced up to the current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak from the Conservative Party.
*16:39.120- 16:45.360* :  This was Kirstama's big pitch. This election is about who our country works for.
*16:46.160- 16:51.540* :  The simple patriotic belief that Britain can be better and must be better.
*16:52.720- 16:58.600* :  Imagine how you would feel waking up on July the 5th to five more years of the Conservatives.
*16:59.180- 17:06.040* :  The choice at this election is clear. Will chaos with the Conservatives or the chance to rebuild Britain
*17:06.040- 17:12.700* :  with a changed Labour Party? For his part the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had this message for voters.
*17:13.360- 17:18.600* :  Either Kirstama or I will be your Prime Minister and a vote for anyone else makes it more likely
*17:18.600- 17:24.000* :  that it will be him. And we've heard a lot about change from him but change to what?
*17:24.900- 17:30.780* :  Kirstama is asking you to hand him a blank check. When he hasn't said what he'll buy with it
*17:31.200- 17:39.020* :  or how much it's going to cost you. In uncertain times we simply cannot afford an uncertain Prime
*17:39.020- 17:45.320* :  Minister. So what did we learn from the debate? Our UK political correspondent Rob Watson was watching
*17:45.800- 17:49.360* :  and spoke to me a short time ago. We learned that the two men, the two parties,
*17:49.360- 17:54.560* :  are going to stick doggedly to their messages. And that is from Rishi Sunak, the governing
*17:54.560- 17:59.220* :  Conservatives, who are trailing miles behind kilometers behind in the opinion polls.
*17:59.220- 18:03.580* :  It's to try and do something to sew down about the opposition to say they're going to raise
*18:03.580- 18:09.360* :  your taxes. You can never really trust a party of the left. Whereas Kirstama was sticking doggedly
*18:09.360- 18:15.400* :  to his message, which is to keep reminding British voters about the Conservatives 14 years in power
*18:15.400- 18:20.200* :  as he would say, the chaos, all the Prime Ministers, Brexit and all the other sort of drama.
*18:20.620- 18:26.040* :  Does it help to clarify voters' views? I mean, research is sort of contrasting on that. I've
*18:26.040- 18:31.020* :  seen some research that suggests it does help people make up their minds and others. It doesn't have
*18:31.380- 18:35.400* :  very much effect. I can tell you that there's been some interesting instant polling on it from
*18:35.400- 18:41.320* :  a company called Yuga, which thought that it's pretty much a draw, although the word that most
*18:41.320- 18:46.840* :  of the votes have seemed to agree on to describe the debate was frustrating. 62% thought that.
*18:47.700- 18:53.660* :  And no knockout punch. It is in a way knockout punches that maybe could change the wider dial.
*18:53.960- 18:58.660* :  Well, the one person who needs a knockout punch is Rishi Sunak, because the Conservatives are
*18:58.660- 19:03.740* :  trailing something like 20 percentage points, but more in the polls, which is truly dangerous
*19:03.740- 19:08.800* :  territory for the Conservatives. Did he do that? No. Will he be happy that he kept repeating
*19:08.800- 19:16.620* :  endlessly time after time? Labour means more taxes, sure, but knockout punch. I didn't see one.
*19:16.620- 19:21.520* :  Maybe I ducked. Maybe you ducked. And no reference to what I heard you describe
*19:21.520- 19:26.040* :  being yesterday as perhaps the most important development in the campaign. And that is the
*19:26.440- 19:32.880* :  reentry of the man who was basically the figurehead of Brexit. Absolutely. That's the return of
*19:32.880- 19:38.320* :  Nigel Farage, probably one of the most consequential politicians since Mrs Stature. I mean, without him,
*19:38.320- 19:42.900* :  I don't think Britain would have left the European Union. No. I mean, there was only one
*19:42.900- 19:46.460* :  brief reference, the one that we heard at the end there from Mr Sunak. The man who has the
*19:46.460- 19:51.680* :  most to worry about the vote on the right being fragmented between him and reform, where he said,
*19:51.680- 19:56.800* :  look, a vote for anything other than the me means a vote for Mr Starm. In other words,
*19:56.800- 20:00.760* :  hang if you vote for reform, you're going to get Labour. But that was the only way in which it came
*20:00.760- 20:06.900* :  up. But Mr Farage is a challenge to both main parties, to mainstream politics, but particularly
*20:06.900- 20:12.920* :  the Conservatives. Rob Watson. To Russia now, President Putin's spokesman has dismissed
*20:12.920- 20:18.940* :  accusations from the technology firm Microsoft that Russia has been stepping up a disinformation
*20:18.940- 20:23.640* :  campaign to spread the fear of violence ahead of the Olympic Games in Paris to meet
*20:23.640- 20:29.240* :  Sri Peskov called the allegations slander. Your original editor, Danny Abahart reports.
*20:29.240- 20:34.760* :  The Paris Olympics kicks off at the end of July. Russia has been banned, although some of its
*20:34.760- 20:41.160* :  athletes can take part as neutrals. On Sunday, Microsoft made detailed allegations in a blog post.
*20:41.760- 20:45.540* :  It accused two Russian groups of creating and distributing fake material,
*20:45.980- 20:50.740* :  designed both to deter spectators by heightening fears of a potential terrorist attack,
*20:50.740- 20:56.940* :  and to denigrate the International Olympic Committee. Some was distributed on hoax versions of real
*20:56.940- 21:03.560* :  reputable news sites. Some was very sophisticated, including it said, a fake feature length documentary
*21:03.560- 21:09.700* :  with slick special effects and AI-generated audio impersonating the Hollywood star, Tom Cruise.
*21:10.520- 21:15.780* :  Microsoft's warning adds to one issued by President Emmanuel Macron in April. He's angered
*21:15.780- 21:21.400* :  Moscow by, among other things, refusing to rule out potentially sending French troops to Ukraine.
*21:22.640- 21:29.720* :  Danny Abahart. Poland will vote in EU elections this weekend with Europe's role in supporting
*21:29.720- 21:35.120* :  Ukraine high on the agenda. Poland has a long border with Ukraine, but Russia and the other
*21:35.120- 21:40.880* :  ruse are its neighbours too. As some EU countries have wavered in their commitment to assisting
*21:40.880- 21:46.720* :  Ukraine militarily, Poland has been a firm voice insisting that the threat from Russia is real
*21:46.720- 21:53.280* :  and close, but there are signs of strains in relations with Kiev at Europe correspondent Sarah
*21:53.280- 22:02.940* :  Reinsford reports. Upon Poland's northern border, a patrol car splashes through the mud.
*22:04.220- 22:08.660* :  To one side, there are coils of farmed wire, and beyond that is Kaliningrad,
*22:09.320- 22:11.740* :  Russian territory that's heavily militarised.
*22:15.580- 22:20.020* :  So Poland is our alert, the border guards' cameras trained across the divide.
*22:21.060- 22:25.440* :  The barred wire went up after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ever since then,
*22:25.440- 22:29.420* :  Poland has warned constantly that Vladimir Putin won't stop there.
*22:33.140- 22:37.900* :  Now Prime Minister Donald Tusk is making Russia his big issue at the European elections.
*22:38.860- 22:44.340* :  Reinforcing Poland's northern border, he told one campaign rally, was about warning the enemy
*22:44.340- 22:52.340* :  to stay away. His plan to spend millions more with more surveillance, even trenches.
*22:58.540- 23:03.480* :  And in Polish schools, there are new security drills. They're run by soldiers with a territorial
*23:03.480- 23:07.380* :  defence, preparing young people here in case of an emergency.
*23:11.640- 23:16.380* :  A judge of just being told to get up, they're practicing an emergency evacuation now,
*23:17.380- 23:20.760* :  with one of the soldiers pulling on behind.
*23:26.180- 23:31.180* :  Obviously there are drills and practices like this in schools right around the world all the time,
*23:31.320- 23:37.000* :  but this one in Poland has extra urgency because of the war in Ukraine, right on Poland's border.
*23:40.020- 23:42.960* :  There are resuscitation drills as well as evacuation.
*23:44.280- 23:46.260* :  Did they explain to you why they're doing this now?
*23:46.480- 23:54.980* :  I think the Russia is near to us and they could attack us, I think. We are in danger.
*23:58.300- 24:02.480* :  But fearing Moscow doesn't always mean unconditional support for Kiev.
*24:06.800- 24:12.480* :  We've just come to the countryside less than an hour from Warsaw and I'm walking through an
*24:12.480- 24:17.720* :  apple orchard, the fruit for now, just about the size of some quite large cherry tomatoes.
*24:18.880- 24:23.540* :  I've come here to talk to the farmers because when it comes to the EU, I think they're less concerned
*24:23.540- 24:29.160* :  about security in the sense of Russian aggression than the security of their income here,
*24:29.660- 24:31.300* :  working in Polish agriculture.
*24:48.520- 24:53.820* :  Farmers here have left their fields lately to protest in Warsaw and on the Ukrainian border.
*24:56.760- 25:01.080* :  Like Mariusz, who says Ukrainian goods are starting to flood the market,
*25:01.780- 25:07.080* :  summer allowed into the EU tariff free to help an economy that's being battered by war.
*25:07.840- 25:13.100* :  But those goods are undercutting Polish produce and Marius says they're threatening his livelihood.
*25:16.680- 25:21.820* :  It looks like Ukraine is fighting a war on two fronts, one with Russia and the other against
*25:21.820- 25:28.580* :  Polish farmers, an economic and agricultural war. If this continues, we will just perish.
*25:29.700- 25:37.160* :  We have no chance. Protecting farmers is a card that the main opposition in Poland's playing
*25:37.160- 25:43.720* :  at these EU elections. But they also believe in standing firm against Russia and the message
*25:43.720- 25:47.460* :  that all Europe needs to remain united and on guard.
*25:48.580- 25:53.340* :  Sarah Reinsford, gunmen have killed the female mayor of a town in Mexico.
*25:53.880- 25:57.920* :  It comes just hours after the country celebrated the election of Claudia Scheinbaum
*25:57.920- 26:04.640* :  as the nation's first woman president. The BBC's Latin America editor, Vanessa Bush-Luter,
*26:04.880- 26:07.520* :  has been following the story and spoke to Luke Jones.
*26:17.100- 26:26.200* :  On Monday evening, local time, she was shot at least 19 times and died in hospital,
*26:26.720- 26:32.380* :  as did her bodyguard, who was also injured in the same attack and there was a gun battle raging,
*26:32.380- 26:36.980* :  because the bodyguard, of course, tried to protect Miss Sanchez.
*26:37.420- 26:41.260* :  Do we know who could be behind this? I mean, have there been any arrests?
*26:42.040- 26:45.720* :  There have been no arrests, which of course is also shocking because this happened
*26:45.740- 26:52.440* :  in the middle of the town and only at 2100 hours, 9pm local time, so not in the middle of the night,
*26:52.440- 27:00.380* :  and yet nobody was apprehended. But the suspicion is that one of the big and infamous cartels,
*27:00.380- 27:04.620* :  cartel called Khalisko New Generation, may be behind this.
*27:05.120- 27:12.060* :  The suspicion is on this cartel because this mayor, Yolanda Sanchez, was actually kidnapped
*27:12.060- 27:17.700* :  last year. She was kidnapped in September and it is thought that the armed men who held her,
*27:17.700- 27:21.500* :  who seized and held her at the time, were members of that same cartel.
*27:21.920- 27:29.720* :  Now, that time she was released and she recounted how the men who had held her had inflicted
*27:30.220- 27:35.320* :  psychological torture on her and had come with certain demands, which the mayor at the time
*27:35.320- 27:42.100* :  did not elaborate on. But what has been said in the past is that she was threatened by this cartel,
*27:42.560- 27:48.880* :  and specifically the cartel wanted was for her to put corrupted police officers in charge
*27:48.880- 27:56.660* :  of security in this particular town and region. Vanessa Bouchluta, a new documentary is out telling
*27:56.660- 28:03.300* :  the remarkable story of brothers Liam and Jessin Fisher aged 7 and 10 and their cousin,
*28:03.300- 28:10.220* :  Kaden Madson aged 9 from the US state of North Dakota, and how they discovered the fossilized
*28:10.220- 28:16.860* :  skeleton of a teenage to Tyronosaurus Rex that died some 67 million years ago. Here's a clip
*28:16.860- 28:23.600* :  from the documentary. I thought it was like, it was pretty cool. It's big.
*28:25.540- 28:33.160* :  When we found it, I was like that has to be a dinosaur. It has a super big femur
*28:34.280- 28:38.320* :  and we sent a picture to Tyron and he said that's a dinosaur.
*28:40.240- 28:46.240* :  Well, Tyler, as you just heard mentioned, is Dr. Tyler Lyson, a paleontologist at Denver
*28:46.240- 28:51.960* :  Museum of Natural Science. He's a friend of the boys family and spoke to Rebecca Kesby.
*28:52.220- 28:57.900* :  I have known Liam, Jessin and Kaden and the family for quite some time. Sam knew obviously that I
*28:57.900- 29:02.940* :  was a paleontologist and that I roamed those same badlands when I was a kid. And so over the
*29:02.940- 29:09.060* :  last several years he would take his boys and his nephew out looking for fossils. In over the
*29:09.060- 29:14.540* :  years, he'd send me photos of his boys like holding a piece of petrified wood or a clamshell
*29:14.540- 29:21.700* :  or other things. And I would identify things for him and then tell him to keep looking because
*29:21.700- 29:31.140* :  I knew they wanted to find a dinosaur. And so in July of 2022, Sam texted me this photo of his
*29:31.140- 29:39.280* :  boy Liam lying down next to the leg of this dinosaur. And I was just so thrilled for them because
*29:39.280- 29:44.120* :  I knew they'd been looking for several years for a dinosaur. And so I texted him back and I'm like,
*29:44.120- 29:49.660* :  hey, congratulations. That's so awesome. You found a dinosaur. It's probably a duck-bill dinosaur,
*29:49.660- 29:58.760* :  but man, that's awesome. So it turns out that it was a teenaged T-rex. So I want to ask you why
*29:58.760- 30:04.880* :  that is so significant because I understand it's actually quite rare to find a T-rex at that age.
*30:06.080- 30:12.000* :  Yeah, that's right. So there have been roughly maybe a hundred or more than a hundred T-rex
*30:12.480- 30:18.040* :  individuals found. Now, not all of those are that complete, but the vast majority of those
*30:18.040- 30:25.640* :  belong to adult transores. And so we really only have maybe five or six publicly available
*30:25.900- 30:32.800* :  juvenile tyrannosaurus specimens from this interval of time, the very latest Cretaceous here in
*30:32.800- 30:38.380* :  North America. And so there's been a lot of debate about the taxonomy of the group. Are there two
*30:38.380- 30:44.540* :  tyrannosaurus and nanotranus and T-rex roaming the landscape? Is it one tyrannosaurus that just
*30:44.540- 30:50.240* :  changes through time, you know, just changes in development? And the challenge with a lot of this
*30:50.240- 30:56.580* :  is that there is not a lot of specimens to base these different ideas on. So it's really important
*30:56.580- 31:02.620* :  to have another data point to help address some of these important issues. Have you named this
*31:02.620- 31:10.520* :  individual and can you tell what killed it? Yeah, so the discoverers of the find are always the
*31:10.520- 31:17.620* :  ones who get to name the dinosaur. And so the three kids, Jess and Liam and Kaden named the dinosaur
*31:17.620- 31:24.980* :  the brothers. And they named it that because they consider their cousin Kaden one of their brothers
*31:24.980- 31:30.920* :  and they were the ones who discovered it. And then they said they consider this teenage T-rex to be
*31:31.140- 31:36.520* :  a one of their brothers as well. So I thought that was a pretty fun and lovely name.
*31:37.400- 31:42.920* :  Future paleontologists, do you think? Yeah, so Jess, he's been wanting to be a paleontologist for
*31:43.120- 31:48.260* :  many years. I know one year his dad sent me a picture of him dressed up as a paleontologist and
*31:49.020- 31:53.880* :  you know, talking with him now, he says this is just underscored his desire to go out and become
*31:53.880- 31:58.400* :  a paleontologist. Dr. Tyler, license speaking to Rebecca Kesby.
