*01:26.720- 01:31.680* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Thursday the 27th of June these are our main stories.
*01:32.360- 01:36.880* :  Reports from Bolivia say there's been a military coup attempt in the city of La Paz,
*01:37.380- 01:42.300* :  but later the president was able to make an address on social media from inside a palace.
*01:43.180- 01:47.220* :  Women across the US may win the right to have an abortion in a medical emergency
*01:47.220- 01:53.540* :  as a result of a Supreme Court ruling, and President Ruta of Kenya has abandoned plan tax
*01:53.540- 01:56.440* :  rises in response to deadly protests on Tuesday.
*01:59.440- 02:04.460* :  Also in this podcast, there are a couple of issues that they're looking at, helium leak being one
*02:04.460- 02:07.320* :  and thruster issues being the other.
*02:07.760- 02:13.320* :  With such problems will two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station return to planet
*02:13.320- 02:22.820* :  Earth. We begin in Bolivia. The scenes on Wednesday in the city of La Paz were for a number of
*02:22.820- 02:28.280* :  hours reminiscent of earlier moments in Latin America's history. Tanks surrounding government
*02:28.280- 02:32.860* :  buildings, men in uniform apparently facing off against those who were elected,
*02:32.860- 02:38.780* :  the government denouncing an attempted coup d'état. As we record this podcast it's
*02:38.780- 02:44.160* :  still hard to work out what exactly is happening in Bolivia, but we know that army units had
*02:44.160- 02:49.780* :  surrounded government buildings in La Paz. At one stage witnesses told the Reuters news agency
*02:49.780- 02:54.180* :  that an armored vehicle had driven through the entrance of the presidential palace.
*02:54.720- 02:59.300* :  During the events on Wednesday the government spokeswoman Minister Maria Nelle Prada
*02:59.300- 03:08.400* :  seemed to suggest they were under siege. I want to announce before the Bolivian people and
*03:08.400- 03:14.560* :  the international community an attempted coup d'état here in Bolivia. I am Maria Nelle Prada,
*03:14.560- 03:20.880* :  government spokesperson. I'm in the presidential palace. Maria Square has been taken over by
*03:20.880- 03:26.440* :  military tanks and military troops. We understand that it's a faction of the army. They've removed
*03:26.440- 03:32.140* :  people from the square and are not allowing others to enter. Then later the scenario changed.
*03:32.140- 03:37.780* :  I spoke to our America's regional editor Leonardo Rosha who gave me the latest on Wednesday's
*03:37.780- 03:43.120* :  events. It looks like the troops there were in this main square surrounding the buildings they
*03:43.120- 03:50.520* :  have left now, but we don't know what that exactly means because we saw the pictures of this
*03:50.780- 03:56.880* :  as you mentioned, enter, crashing the gates of the presidential palace. We saw pictures of the
*03:56.920- 04:03.960* :  president surrounded by troops inside the palace and about half an hour later and an hour later
*04:03.960- 04:10.600* :  the president went on on social media and made a statement. He appointed new military commanders.
*04:10.980- 04:15.540* :  He urged people to take to the streets and he said he was going to defeat the school.
*04:16.020- 04:21.660* :  A few moments later the troops left this square. We don't know if this is over or if this is
*04:21.700- 04:27.720* :  still ongoing, but what we have now is a situation that's very worrying and very concerning in
*04:27.720- 04:32.920* :  Bolivia. Has there been any official word from the army or any factions of the army which
*04:32.920- 04:38.840* :  might be involved in what does look like an attempted coup? No, this army commander General
*04:40.020- 04:46.020* :  he said he was changing the cabinet that the army just couldn't watch things going on. I mean
*04:46.020- 04:51.580* :  it's the presence of the sensor left president and the army has been at odds with left wing
*04:51.580- 04:56.180* :  governments in Bolivia for a while. So we couldn't just watch this happening and we're going to
*04:56.180- 05:00.740* :  change the government. He even announced he was going to release political prisoners which you
*05:00.740- 05:08.060* :  presume is a former president who was in jail a few years ago. So after that we had the deployment of
*05:08.060- 05:13.580* :  these troops from the central area of the city. But you have to remember that Bolivia has two
*05:13.580- 05:18.980* :  realities. You have the highlands, the mountains, the andes, where the support is for the government
*05:18.980- 05:23.800* :  and for the left. And you have the lowlands that are more productive and rich part of the country,
*05:23.800- 05:29.020* :  Santa Cruz, where the support has been for the right wing governments and probably the government
*05:29.020- 05:32.760* :  of the military. So I don't know if that will carry on if this is over.
*05:33.120- 05:39.060* :  Leonardo Russia. The rules on abortion in the US state of Idaho are among the toughest in the
*05:39.060- 05:45.320* :  country. Women are not allowed in abortion even in a medical emergency. At least for now the
*05:45.320- 05:50.580* :  Supreme Court seems to have accidentally posted its draft ruling on a case that could change that.
*05:51.200- 05:55.720* :  President Biden's administration had argued that America's national law takes precedence
*05:56.180- 06:00.800* :  and this says that hospitals must make an abortion available to a woman who needs it in an
*06:00.800- 06:06.680* :  emergency. States they insisted have no right to override this. It is our correspondent in
*06:06.680- 06:11.740* :  Washington, Nomiya Igbar, explaining to me, the Supreme Court's potential decision could have
*06:11.740- 06:16.760* :  major implications for women across the country as well as those in Idaho itself.
*06:17.560- 06:23.500* :  What this means, and that is if this draft does go on to become the official ruling,
*06:23.500- 06:31.440* :  is that any pregnant woman that goes into an emergency room in Idaho state and needs stabilizing
*06:31.440- 06:37.540* :  treatment, she will be able to get an abortion that will be included as a treatment.
*06:38.340- 06:45.080* :  What this case essentially was about was can women get that? Idaho is a very conservative state.
*06:45.080- 06:50.080* :  It has a near total abortion ban and President Biden's administration had said,
*06:50.640- 06:58.000* :  Idaho state law is breaching the federal law which is known as mtuller by not providing abortion
*06:58.040- 07:04.620* :  care in certain cases where it is medically necessary. And what this this document what it's
*07:05.100- 07:13.160* :  seeming to indicate is that the court is voting six to three to rule against Idaho on what appears
*07:13.160- 07:20.640* :  to be technical issues. If this draft ruling does go ahead does that mean it applies in all states
*07:20.640- 07:26.880* :  not just Idaho that no matter what any state wants to do national law means that a woman who needs
*07:26.880- 07:33.320* :  an abortion in an emergency situation will be able to get it. That's correct mtuller will be
*07:33.320- 07:38.920* :  the main law in all of this as a federal law and that is President Biden's administration's
*07:38.920- 07:45.620* :  arguments that federal law takes precedent and state law cannot breach it by not providing
*07:45.620- 07:51.400* :  abortion care in certain cases where it is medically necessary. Now I gather that this draft
*07:51.400- 07:56.380* :  ruling was posted accidentally people weren't supposed to hear about it just yet.
*07:57.080- 08:02.440* :  It was inadvertently posted and then it was removed from the website the Supreme Court confirmed
*08:02.440- 08:08.880* :  to the BBC that it did inadvertently post this online. We have seen the document we have gone
*08:08.880- 08:16.240* :  through it so we can verify it in that respect but the Supreme Court will stress that this is not
*08:16.240- 08:22.040* :  the final ruling this was just a draft and we don't know exactly when we will get that final
*08:22.040- 08:28.280* :  ruling. We should find out at some point before their term finishes. Nomiya Ikbal in Washington next
*08:28.280- 08:34.600* :  to the UK. In nine days time one of the two men standing here will be Prime Minister. Tonight
*08:34.620- 08:39.180* :  they go head to head. Welcome to the BBC Prime Ministerial debate.
*08:45.040- 08:49.800* :  A fanfare heralding the start of what will be the last leaders debate in Britain's general
*08:49.800- 08:55.760* :  election campaign and for once the arguments managed to live up to that dramatic musical introduction
*08:56.560- 09:01.720* :  sort of. Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunag was long regarded as a safe pair of hands
*09:01.720- 09:06.780* :  technocrat rather than one of the conservative parties sound and fury tub thumpers.
*09:07.120- 09:12.880* :  Now that has changed somewhat over the last few weeks. Mr Sunag is very much the underdog in this
*09:12.880- 09:18.160* :  contest. Poles predicting he'll lose badly to the Labour Party and its leader Kirstama.
*09:18.760- 09:24.080* :  Fighting for his political life the Prime Minister has manifested previously unseen metal.
*09:24.660- 09:29.020* :  No more so than when harrying his opponent on the issue of illegal immigration.
*09:48.260- 09:52.700* :  There was a time when the vast majority of British voters plummet either for the conservatives
*09:52.700- 09:59.180* :  or Labour. Not now though, challengers like the Green Party and the more right wing party reform and
*09:59.180- 10:05.060* :  the centrist Liberal Democrats are sucking up support as never before. It was typical that this
*10:05.060- 10:11.540* :  question proved popular before anyone even had a chance to answer it. Are you two really the best
*10:12.020- 10:16.600* :  we've got to be the next Prime Minister of our great country?
*10:17.020- 10:24.820* :  Well I spoke to our political correspondent Rob Watts and who watched the debate. I asked him whether
*10:24.820- 10:29.660* :  the Prime Minister or his challenger had managed to win anyone over. It's always an incredibly
*10:29.660- 10:34.600* :  difficult question to answer Paul. I can certainly tell you that the people who asked those
*10:34.600- 10:39.200* :  questions and you heard one of them there, that sort of, oh my goodness, is this the best they
*10:39.200- 10:44.180* :  can offer? I mean they weren't impressed by the answers that they heard. I mean whether people
*10:44.180- 10:48.420* :  watching were impressed, it would have been quite a difficult watch. I mean they were fighting. There
*10:48.420- 10:53.880* :  was lots of sort of shouting over each other. They were both extremely competitive. I mean I guess
*10:53.880- 10:57.880* :  like an only answer your question Paul by saying that there have been lots and lots of debates
*10:57.880- 11:03.900* :  in the selection campaign so far and they've really just barely had any effect whatsoever on
*11:03.900- 11:07.720* :  the opinion polls with Labour as you said, still having a pretty whopping lead.
*11:08.180- 11:12.560* :  So much for the tone of the debate. What were the main issues that the two were arguing about this
*11:12.560- 11:17.240* :  evening? Well the main issues were the ones that you might have predicted. I mean one was about
*11:17.240- 11:21.980* :  trust in politicians, which is an all-time low in this country, and then there was broadly
*11:21.980- 11:26.720* :  about the economy where essentially Rishi Suneak sang my goodness under the left of centre
*11:26.720- 11:32.640* :  Labour Party. Everyone would be paying higher taxes and essentially Keir Starmer making the argument
*11:32.640- 11:37.960* :  that looked under 14 years of the Conservatives, living standards have stagnated and there's been
*11:37.960- 11:43.920* :  a sort of general level of chaos and instability. And there was also a proper ding dong on the
*11:43.920- 11:48.900* :  question of immigration with again Mr Suneak saying look, immigration would go up under Labour,
*11:48.900- 11:54.680* :  but with Mr Starmer retorting, hang on a minute, immigration has been a absolute record highs
*11:54.680- 11:59.740* :  for the last 14 years. The Conservatives have been in power. Briefly Rob, I mentioned those smaller
*11:59.740- 12:04.240* :  parties doing better than previously in British politics are. Are they likely to do well? Do you
*12:04.240- 12:09.180* :  think the Greens and that further right party reform? I think the short answer to your question
*12:09.180- 12:15.680* :  Paul is absolutely yes. I think they may well have the biggest share since the 1920s, but because
*12:15.680- 12:21.040* :  of Britain's electoral system, the first passed the post-disproportional system, it's possible
*12:21.040- 12:25.900* :  that they may get a whacking historic share of the vote away from the two main parties but still
*12:25.900- 12:33.040* :  not win that many seats. Rob Watson, 23 people were killed, the country's parliament was ransacked
*12:33.040- 12:39.040* :  and set on fire, the army called out to quell the protests. But now it seems that demonstrators
*12:39.040- 12:43.440* :  who took to the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi on Tuesday have got what they wanted,
*12:44.020- 12:49.560* :  or at least achieved their main professed goal. Kenya's president William Ruto has cancelled plans
*12:49.560- 12:56.540* :  for a new finance bill which would have put up taxes. Having reflected on the continuing
*12:56.540- 13:04.720* :  conversation around the content of the finance bill 2024 and listening keenly to the people of Kenya
*13:06.120- 13:15.260* :  who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this finance bill 2024, I concede
*13:17.040- 13:26.000* :  and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill. Raising taxes was supposed to be a way to help
*13:26.000- 13:31.760* :  get Kenya's finances in order. Instead of doing that, President Ruto has said he will cut the
*13:31.760- 13:37.340* :  amount spent by his own politicians. Starting with the office of the president, operational
*13:37.340- 13:44.980* :  expenditure in the presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the conventure for reduced
*13:45.420- 13:54.420* :  travel, hospitality, parties of motor vehicles, renovations and other expenditures.
*13:57.300- 14:02.840* :  It's not just about the money. President Ruto's whole attitude on Wednesday seemed to be about
*14:02.840- 14:08.040* :  making amends and reaching out to those who had risen up against his government. He said he would
*14:08.040- 14:12.600* :  now enter into dialogue with young people who were at the forefront of Tuesday's protests.
*14:13.460- 14:19.260* :  And yet his conciliatory tone may be too late. With a toll from Tuesday's police crackdowns
*14:19.260- 14:24.340* :  still being assessed, Davis Malambi is executive director of the Kenyan Human Rights Commission.
*14:24.760- 14:29.580* :  He says that as well as the near two dozen deaths, more than a hundred people were being treated
*14:29.580- 14:34.940* :  for gunshot wounds. President Ruto is responsible. Mr. Ruto, as I've seen,
*14:35.100- 14:41.880* :  a plant and a executable massacre against peaceful protesters and also other Kenyans who came
*14:42.620- 14:48.000* :  to support across the country to reject the Pyrrriti finance bill. The police shot young
*14:48.000- 14:52.720* :  unarmed protesters outside parliament with their killing going into the night.
*14:52.720- 14:58.340* :  With a situation in Kenya so polarised, few predicted such a rapid concession by the
*14:58.340- 15:04.360* :  country's president. So why, I asked, an African correspondent Barbara Platt Asher, did Mr.
*15:04.360- 15:11.180* :  Ruto back down? I think the violence on Tuesday played a big role. He came out very strongly
*15:11.180- 15:16.620* :  after the protesters' storm parliament and said that the security apparatus would make sure
*15:16.620- 15:21.060* :  that this didn't happen again. He called the criminals who had infiltrated the anti-tax protests.
*15:21.500- 15:26.500* :  But at the same time, the police response, which was quite deadly and are more than 20 people killed
*15:26.540- 15:31.180* :  and more injured, was kind of a shock to the country, I think. And there was a sort of backlash
*15:31.180- 15:36.740* :  about it. The religious leaders, social organisations condemned it and said, you know,
*15:36.740- 15:42.720* :  called for restraint. And also Mr. Ruto's international partners responded similarly. So I think
*15:43.620- 15:48.240* :  given that all of that and given that that felt really like there were sort of dangerous tensions
*15:48.240- 15:53.520* :  building, he made the decision to step back. The protesters were demanding that the bill be
*15:53.520- 15:59.820* :  withdrawn, but they were also some of them demanding that President Ruto resign. More than 20 of them
*15:59.820- 16:04.320* :  were killed. Do you think that they're now going to be placated with this or will they, the protests
*16:04.320- 16:09.680* :  continue? Well, we've had reaction from some of the prominent activists on social media who have
*16:09.680- 16:15.300* :  dismissed this move. They have said, for example, this is a PR gesture. This isn't going to bring our
*16:15.300- 16:20.400* :  dead back. One other activist said, you know, basically don't trust Mr. Ruto. He's got some sort
*16:20.400- 16:26.100* :  of agenda. We'll see you on the streets. So there is a will there to continue. And I expect that
*16:26.100- 16:30.920* :  there probably will be demonstrations. Again, the next big one was called for Thursday because
*16:30.920- 16:34.980* :  that was the day Mr. Ruto was supposed to sign the bill. So they were all going to come out and try
*16:34.980- 16:40.060* :  to prevent him or pressure him not to do that. So it may be that some of the pressures and the
*16:40.060- 16:44.440* :  tensions will have been diffused and there will be less people out. It's not clear because it seems
*16:44.440- 16:49.140* :  there is still a will for some of the some of the protesters to go out. And it will also, we will
*16:49.140- 16:53.040* :  also need to watch closely how the security services respond because of course the military was
*16:53.040- 17:00.940* :  deployed by Mr. Ruto and it was quite quite severe on Tuesday. So how that will play out now after
*17:00.940- 17:08.320* :  this turn around remains to be seen. Barbara Pledarsha. You may have thought it worrying when Boeing
*17:08.320- 17:14.180* :  aeroplanes seem to be malfunctioning and exit door blowing off mid-flight allegations that safety
*17:14.180- 17:19.680* :  procedures will regularly ignored. And now it's the company's spacecraft which is causing concern
*17:19.680- 17:25.480* :  not least for two astronauts stranded in space. Barry Wilmore and Senator Williams were only
*17:25.480- 17:30.600* :  supposed to spend eight days at the International Space Station, but they've already been there
*17:30.600- 17:35.020* :  for almost three weeks and they've now been told there are still problems with the Boeing
*17:35.020- 17:39.360* :  Starliner which brought them there and which was supposed to take them back to Earth.
*17:39.360- 17:45.140* :  Evan Davis spoke to Susan Kilrain an aerospace engineer that she explained what exactly the
*17:45.140- 17:50.440* :  technical problems were. There are a couple of issues that they're looking at, helium late being one
*17:50.440- 17:57.520* :  and thruster issues being the other. The aircraft is safe. They technically could come home,
*17:58.020- 18:04.580* :  but why? They are taking this time while they're in space to troubleshoot the issues, see if they
*18:04.580- 18:11.780* :  can fix the issues. At the same time testing out some other things that they can do as targets
*18:11.780- 18:18.240* :  of opportunity while they're there. The original return date wasn't a hard date. It was a no
*18:18.240- 18:26.120* :  earlier than date and then so it has slipped and if all goes well they'll be able to fix
*18:26.120- 18:32.780* :  everything that's going wrong but they'll definitely know more about it. Susan is there a plan B?
*18:33.080- 18:38.300* :  I mean I suppose it wouldn't be good for Boeing but the plan B must be involving an Elon Musk
*18:38.300- 18:44.620* :  spacecraft to take them back. NASA always has a plan B. NASA doesn't like being one failure away
*18:44.620- 18:51.800* :  from losing astronauts or spaceship or anything like that so there's always enough seats up there
*18:51.800- 18:58.960* :  to get everybody home safely and there are. Typically there's a dragon, there's a Soyuz,
*18:58.960- 19:05.020* :  now there's a starliner so there are enough seats there. If at any given time one of those vehicles
*19:05.020- 19:10.080* :  becomes inoperable they would send another one up. Of course this time they wouldn't send another
*19:10.080- 19:18.160* :  starliner but they would send probably a dragon. Absolutely. They're safe and they'll get back safely.
*19:18.700- 19:23.000* :  Okay you're not sounding worried about the welfare of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmer. What are they
*19:23.000- 19:28.260* :  up to while they're there? How comfortable are they in the international space center? Obviously they
*19:28.580- 19:33.240* :  probably hadn't been anticipating that have two guests for so long. What would be the set up there?
*19:33.420- 19:39.200* :  They're definitely comfortable up there and you know oftentimes there are guests like when Axiom
*19:39.500- 19:46.700* :  goes up in a dragon and there are places for these astronauts to sleep and food to eat and oxygen
*19:46.700- 19:51.840* :  to breathe. Suni and Butch probably wake up every day, pinching themselves that they're still in
*19:51.840- 19:57.840* :  space and they still get to maybe help out with the science, maybe help the space station crew get
*19:57.840- 20:06.220* :  ready for their EVAs so there's not really any concern there. Susan Kilrain, an aerospace engineer
*20:06.220- 20:14.960* :  and former NASA astronaut. Still to come. They measured the decibels or the rehearsals beforehand
*20:14.960- 20:20.600* :  and they didn't think it would disrupt the animals at all. But it seems it did. An animal conservation
*20:20.600- 20:26.660* :  center in Spain has blamed loud music from a festival for the deaths of several endangered gazelles.
*20:35.540- 20:41.060* :  Jewelry can say many things on your wedding day. As a wedding band it can say this is a forever

*21:08.420- 21:14.560* :  opposite of what Big Wireless does. They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally when
*21:14.560- 21:19.500* :  they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices
*21:19.500- 21:24.340* :  due to not hating you. That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month

*21:42.800- 21:47.980* :  to force their way through a western suburb of Raffa, the city in the south of Gaza, which has
*21:47.980- 21:54.060* :  already seen so much fierce fighting. Israel's military says its aircraft struck dozens of targets.
*21:54.060- 22:00.300* :  The Hamas run health authority said at least 60 people were killed in the last 24 hours alone.
*22:00.300- 22:06.340* :  And as our Middle East regional editor Sebastian Asher reports from Jerusalem, all the signs are that
*22:06.340- 22:11.560* :  this latest round of hostilities is set to continue. The focus of the Israeli offensive has
*22:11.640- 22:17.900* :  continued to be in Raffa, the southernmost city, where Israel says that remaining battalions of
*22:17.900- 22:23.540* :  Hamas and potentially some of the hostilities being held remain. And the focus has been over
*22:23.960- 22:28.900* :  in the west of Raffa, with as you were saying is where the tanks try to continue to try to break
*22:28.900- 22:35.060* :  through and reports from Hamas and Palestinian sources, but they've met fierce resistance
*22:35.720- 22:41.480* :  from both Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters. They've also continued to blow up buildings,
*22:42.140- 22:47.160* :  essentially to clear the areas. There's some dramatic video that was posted by Palestinian media
*22:47.160- 22:52.840* :  sources of a number of residential buildings being blown up at a roundabout, but it's not
*22:53.280- 22:57.140* :  just in Raffa. And that's where I guess you could say that fighting the military operation
*22:57.180- 23:02.940* :  is still really continuing. In other parts, in the north, in a refugee camp there,
*23:03.420- 23:08.300* :  eyewitnesses say that three Palestinians were killed and in the center at another refugee camp
*23:08.300- 23:16.680* :  five reportedly killed. So it continues to be a big toll on the Palestinians, the attacks that
*23:16.680- 23:24.240* :  Israel is continuing, but the numbers aren't the same that we saw in the phase of intense bombardment
*23:24.240- 23:30.680* :  in the first month of a war, when 100, 120, 150 people were being killed at each 24 hours,
*23:30.680- 23:36.200* :  what we're seeing now is still very high figures, but between about 40 to 60 are being reported
*23:36.200- 23:42.820* :  by the Gaza Health Ministry. Sebastian Asha. The French appeal court has upheld an arrest warrant
*23:42.820- 23:48.400* :  for the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad on war crimes charges and crimes against humanity,
*23:48.400- 23:53.400* :  such a warrant against a serving head of state is extremely rare. Mike Thompson reports,
*23:54.300- 24:00.160* :  President Assad stands accused among other alleged crimes of chemical weapons attacks on
*24:00.180- 24:06.040* :  two opposition held Damascus suburbs in 2013 that killed more than a thousand people.
*24:06.140- 24:12.440* :  The Paris Appeals Court has rejected the claim that he has absolute immunity as a serving head
*24:12.440- 24:19.040* :  of state. A arrest warrant has also been issued for President Assad's brother Mahir and two Syrian
*24:19.040- 24:25.200* :  generals. The investigation has been conducted in France under what's called universal jurisdiction.
*24:26.260- 24:31.860* :  Mike Thompson. NATO has a new Secretary-General, the outgoing Dutch Prime Minister,
*24:31.860- 24:36.680* :  Mark Rutte, will assume the post when the incumbent Yen Stoltenberg stands down at the beginning
*24:36.680- 24:42.900* :  of October and what a time to take on this role, with NATO facing what some believe to be the
*24:42.900- 24:48.740* :  biggest crisis in its history. Russia, invading Ukraine, the possibility of Donald Trump becoming
*24:48.740- 24:54.940* :  US President again, a man whose support for NATO is far from guaranteed. Mr. Rutte has quite an
*24:54.940- 24:58.940* :  inbox waiting for him as our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel reports.
*24:59.940- 25:04.120* :  Mark Rutte said it was a tremendous honour to be appointed as the next head of NATO,
*25:04.920- 25:10.380* :  but it's not a surprise. The outgoing Dutch Prime Minister has been the clear frontrunner for months.
*25:11.420- 25:16.680* :  Mr. Rutte is well known on the global stage and is seen as a consensus builder.
*25:17.440- 25:23.900* :  It's what's helped him stay in power for 14 years. Those skills will be key to keeping the 32
*25:23.900- 25:29.300* :  member alliance together. He's already managed to get the backing of some of NATO's more
*25:29.300- 25:35.620* :  awkward members, Hungary and Turkey, but there'll be bigger tests, not least in dealing with the
*25:35.620- 25:42.300* :  possibility of a second Trump term. Donald Trump has long been a skeptic of the alliance,
*25:43.160- 25:49.380* :  but he got on with Rutte. Some US and European politicians question Mr. Rutte's suitability
*25:49.860- 25:56.200* :  given his record on military spending. He never met NATO's own 2% of GDP target,
*25:57.140- 26:03.260* :  but since Russia's full-scale invasion, he has boosted Dutch defence spending and has led efforts
*26:03.260- 26:12.240* :  to supply Ukraine with F-16 jets. President Zelensky hailed Mark Rutte as a principled and strong leader.
*26:13.020- 26:18.200* :  And Jens Stoltenberg, who'll hand over in the autumn, said he was leaving the alliance
*26:18.380- 26:25.960* :  in good hands. Jonathan Biel. The Japanese Yen has fallen to its weakest level against the US dollar
*26:25.960- 26:31.820* :  for nearly 40 years, causing jitters on the markets, and prompting concern that the authorities may
*26:31.820- 26:35.940* :  again be forced to step in to boost the currency. James Wickham reports.
*26:36.620- 26:44.440* :  The Yen's new low down as much as 0.4% to 160.39 per dollar is below the level at which
*26:44.440- 26:50.480* :  officials stepped in back in April. The Yen's lost more than 12% of its value this year,
*26:50.820- 26:54.940* :  which is good for exports, as it means items are cheaper in overseas markets,
*26:55.500- 27:00.960* :  but not for Japanese consumers who are seeing the cost of imported goods rise steeply. Much of
*27:00.960- 27:05.580* :  the pressure on the Yen comes from years of low interest rates in the country, which now means
*27:05.580- 27:12.300* :  there's a large gap between it and the US. James Wickham. Saving animals from extinction is not
*27:12.300- 27:17.500* :  exactly an easy task at the best of times, but a conservation centre in Spain has found the
*27:17.500- 27:23.620* :  task particularly tough lately and with tragic results. The complex is near the southern Spanish town
*27:23.620- 27:29.420* :  of Almería, and has become the home for an endangered species of gazelle. But staff there say
*27:29.420- 27:35.580* :  loud music from a nearby festival scared the animals so badly they panicked and ran into walls,
*27:35.580- 27:41.340* :  breaking bones, and leaving four of them dead. The BBC's Marlo Casino has been following this story.
*27:41.780- 27:47.100* :  Atomi first, why the festival have been allowed to go ahead with vulnerable animals so close by.
*27:47.680- 27:52.880* :  They measured the decibels and on the rehearsals beforehand and they didn't think it would disrupt
*27:52.880- 27:59.100* :  the animals at all, so the local authorities have said that the decibels measured were 65 decibels,
*27:59.100- 28:05.140* :  which in their opinion was not enough to cause any huge disruption, but the conservation centre
*28:05.640- 28:12.500* :  begs to differ on that front. I gather that these gazelles are particularly sensitive to noise,
*28:12.500- 28:18.040* :  is that right? They are particularly sensitive to noise, particularly at this time of the year,
*28:18.040- 28:24.600* :  so it's their breeding season right now, and the vet, the centres vet who I spoke to said that because
*28:24.640- 28:30.600* :  the gazelles are prey in their natural habitat, they tend to run away from anything that disturbs them.
*28:30.600- 28:35.440* :  So it's not just the music, but it's also the vibration and everything that around it,
*28:35.740- 28:41.780* :  and by running away they get so distressed and some of them ran into walls, breaking their neck and
*28:41.780- 28:47.940* :  legs, it was quite traumatic. This is a particularly special kind of gazelle, is it that they're seeking
*28:47.940- 28:55.140* :  to preserve them? Yes, so these gazelles, they're three different species at this conservation centre,
*28:55.680- 29:01.480* :  and what makes them special is that they're native to Northern Africa, but where they are from,
*29:01.900- 29:07.260* :  originally they're endangered and not able to survive in the wild as well. So this conservation centre
*29:07.740- 29:14.620* :  serves the community, the biodiversity community worldwide, and it's hosted by Spain with support
*29:14.620- 29:19.840* :  from the Spanish government for the last 60 years, and they've been able to build up numbers
*29:19.840- 29:25.600* :  quite significantly to the point that now they're around 400 gazelles at the centre.
*29:26.200- 29:30.840* :  What have the organisers of the festivals said about this suggestion that the music
*29:31.400- 29:37.520* :  caused the death of these very special animals? So the festival was organised by the city,
*29:37.520- 29:43.840* :  the city's authorities, and the city council said that they're very sorry for the deaths,
*29:44.160- 29:50.660* :  but they believe the conservation centre has been quite hasty and you know a bit too quick
*29:51.060- 29:56.320* :  to point the blame at them, because there's so many other factors involved in their opinion
*29:56.320- 30:00.360* :  that it's not as clear-cut as that. Marlou Casino
