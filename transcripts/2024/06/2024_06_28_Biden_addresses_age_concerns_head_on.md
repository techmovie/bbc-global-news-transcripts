*01:07.520- 01:08.420* :  A lot of laughs.
*01:08.420- 01:09.260* :  Y'all weird.
*01:09.540- 01:09.880* :  But you.
*01:10.480- 01:10.820* :  Yeah, you.
*01:11.260- 01:11.860* :  You were different.

*01:27.060- 01:33.080* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Saturday, the 29th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:33.700- 01:39.100* :  Joe Biden comes back fighting at a political rally after Thursday night's disastrous TV
*01:39.100- 01:40.360* :  debate with Donald Trump.
*01:40.880- 01:44.540* :  Iran goes to the polls to elect a new president after the previous one,
*01:44.540- 01:47.220* :  Ibrahim Raici, died in a helicopter crash.
*01:47.740- 01:53.580* :  The roof of the main airport terminal in the Indian city of Delhi collapses in heavy rain.
*01:55.560- 01:56.740* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:03.980- 02:10.180* :  Why the famous classical masterpiece, Ballero, has become the center of a big copyright battle.
*02:13.780- 02:19.600* :  For President Biden, Thursday night's televised debate was even for many Democrats at dismal
*02:19.600- 02:20.160* :  performance.
*02:20.180- 02:25.800* :  But on Friday, he was back on the campaign trail in fighting spirit at a rally in North
*02:25.800- 02:26.420* :  Carolina.
*02:26.420- 02:31.400* :  Donald Trump was also addressing his supporters, claiming victory over his rival.
*02:32.020- 02:32.500* :  Thank you.
*02:32.540- 02:33.340* :  Hello, Virginia.
*02:33.380- 02:37.440* :  Did anybody last night watch a thing called a debate?
*02:38.620- 02:42.920* :  That was a big one.
*02:43.320- 02:49.000* :  But as you saw on television last night, we had a big victory against a man that really
*02:49.000- 02:51.600* :  is looking to destroy our country.
*02:51.600- 02:52.480* :  He's the worst.
*02:52.480- 02:57.380* :  He's the most corrupt, the most incompetent president of the history of our country.
*02:57.760- 03:02.980* :  After Thursday night's debate in which Mr. Biden appeared rambling and hesitant, the
*03:02.980- 03:04.760* :  pressure was on to make a good speech.
*03:04.820- 03:10.360* :  Many were concerned that his age, 81, remained an issue, but Mr. Biden told his supporters
*03:10.360- 03:15.000* :  in rally in North Carolina that he could still serve as their commander in chief.
*03:15.500- 03:16.720* :  I know I'm not a young man.
*03:18.060- 03:18.760* :  Stayed the obvious.
*03:19.840- 03:20.440* :  Well, I know.
*03:21.980- 03:23.680* :  I don't walk as easily as I used to.
*03:23.840- 03:25.580* :  I don't speak as smoothly as I used to.
*03:26.320- 03:28.520* :  I don't debate as well as I used to.
*03:29.500- 03:31.360* :  But I know what I do know.
*03:32.200- 03:33.680* :  I know how to tell the truth.
*03:34.860- 03:36.140* :  I know how to get things done.
*03:36.400- 03:38.320* :  I know like the millions of Americans know.
*03:39.060- 03:41.420* :  And you get knocked down, you get back up.
*03:45.740- 03:49.880* :  Also in rally, it was our North America correspondent, Nomiya Ikbal.
*03:50.120- 03:53.400* :  I spoke to her shortly after President Biden gave his speech.
*03:53.960- 03:56.460* :  She'd be forgiven for thinking, was that a different man?
*03:56.460- 03:59.680* :  It was a complete contrast to last night, perhaps that was intended.
*03:59.680- 04:04.100* :  He would have woken up this morning to a torrent of bad news headlines suggesting it was
*04:04.100- 04:04.780* :  over for him.
*04:04.940- 04:10.220* :  He directly addressed his debate, fail as many are saying that it was.
*04:10.480- 04:14.040* :  And he was basically everything that he was criticized for not being last night.
*04:14.040- 04:16.620* :  He was sharp, he was passionate, he was fiery.
*04:16.620- 04:20.820* :  He was clear on what he believes is a threat from Donald Trump.
*04:21.360- 04:23.100* :  I stopped and spoke to a few people afterwards.
*04:23.100- 04:26.480* :  I mean, the crowd was so raucous, they were cheering him on every moment.
*04:26.480- 04:27.660* :  And that of course helps.
*04:27.660- 04:29.340* :  There wasn't an audience last night.
*04:30.040- 04:36.100* :  They said to me, one man, his name is Corey Branch, a supporter, Raleigh City Council member.
*04:36.100- 04:38.320* :  He said, we've just got to carry that energy to November.
*04:38.780- 04:40.520* :  And I said to him, where was that energy yesterday?
*04:40.520- 04:44.040* :  And he said, well, look, the president had a lot of information in his head.
*04:44.420- 04:48.000* :  When you know so much and you're so prepared, it's hard to fit in such a short time.
*04:48.460- 04:49.400* :  He was let loose.
*04:50.060- 04:54.140* :  And that was generally the feeling here from a lot of supporters that, okay,
*04:54.180- 04:57.080* :  it wasn't the best performance that he gave.
*04:57.080- 05:01.100* :  But they also believe that it was just one performance, does not make him who he is.
*05:01.680- 05:06.920* :  And he will be fine that, you know, November, it's a long way to go.
*05:07.100- 05:10.580* :  Any theories, though, as to why the performances were so different.
*05:10.580- 05:13.620* :  I've heard some people say, well, he was using a teleprompter this time,
*05:13.620- 05:16.160* :  but when he was asked to do it live, it was much harder for him.
*05:16.340- 05:19.520* :  I think there's a lot to be said about being in front of the crowd.
*05:20.440- 05:26.660* :  I mean, he came out to an audience that was just full of applause, full of cheer.
*05:27.440- 05:30.020* :  Just really, really happy for him to be here.
*05:30.020- 05:33.000* :  And one woman we spoke to said, I think he got some rest last night.
*05:33.620- 05:37.100* :  So maybe that's why he's a little bit more energised.
*05:37.200- 05:41.060* :  And he will be well aware of the huge criticism that he's facing,
*05:41.060- 05:44.280* :  this pressure he's now facing from members of his own party.
*05:44.840- 05:46.280* :  And he will want to prove that.
*05:46.320- 05:52.000* :  And he said to quote him, with my life and soul, I know I can do this job.
*05:52.620- 05:53.860* :  The threat is too serious.
*05:53.920- 05:56.920* :  And I think with that sentence, he made it quite clear.
*05:57.160- 05:57.860* :  He's going nowhere.
*05:57.860- 06:01.020* :  But can he persuade Americans and Democrats?
*06:01.020- 06:04.760* :  These fit enough to be their commander in chief for another four years.
*06:04.760- 06:07.380* :  Or is this just going to dog him right through to the election day?
*06:07.760- 06:09.480* :  I think his age will continue to dog him.
*06:09.480- 06:10.560* :  There's no doubt about that.
*06:10.560- 06:12.520* :  There is another debate coming up in September.
*06:12.560- 06:14.100* :  He said he's committed to that.
*06:14.100- 06:15.160* :  So is Donald Trump.
*06:15.740- 06:18.280* :  You know, there's an argument to say, June, it's, as I say,
*06:18.280- 06:19.200* :  it's a few months away.
*06:19.200- 06:20.920* :  It's some time people can forget.
*06:21.600- 06:23.740* :  But ultimately, you know, it's about turning out the vote
*06:23.740- 06:25.360* :  and persuading those on the margins.
*06:25.360- 06:28.400* :  And ultimately, in swing states, like North Carolina, by the way.
*06:28.740- 06:31.620* :  And I think all that we'll see now is that President Biden
*06:31.620- 06:33.320* :  will be even more scrutinized.
*06:33.920- 06:37.700* :  Nomiya Ekpal, from the US, we now turn to Iran,
*06:37.860- 06:39.720* :  where millions have spent Friday voting
*06:39.720- 06:41.780* :  in the presidential election there.
*06:41.940- 06:44.100* :  They're choosing among a tightly controlled
*06:44.100- 06:48.700* :  as to four candidates loyal to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini
*06:48.700- 06:53.380* :  to replace Ibrahim Raesi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May.
*06:53.840- 06:56.200* :  There's only one reformist in the ballot.
*06:56.660- 06:59.880* :  Masoud Pasez-Kian, a former heart surgeon,
*06:59.880- 07:02.960* :  who's previously criticized Iran's morality police.
*07:03.440- 07:05.640* :  His campaign rally is attracted growing crowds
*07:05.640- 07:07.260* :  in the run-up to polling day.
*07:07.360- 07:10.400* :  These women from Tehran shared their views about the election
*07:10.800- 07:11.380* :  with the BBC.
*07:12.260- 07:14.720* :  I know it's national duty.
*07:14.740- 07:16.980* :  I should vote, but I won't.
*07:17.240- 07:20.540* :  For 45 years, the Islamic Republic has put its own interests
*07:20.660- 07:23.300* :  ahead of the needs of 80 million who deserve better.
*07:23.840- 07:26.660* :  For reformists, conservatives, they are all the same.
*07:27.220- 07:29.800* :  They have done nothing to save people from a sanctioned,
*07:30.000- 07:30.860* :  crippling economy.
*07:31.160- 07:34.460* :  Man Raimi Dam, I would be voting for Mr. Pasez-Kian.
*07:34.920- 07:36.140* :  Pasez-Kian seems clean.
*07:36.140- 07:39.720* :  I mean, there are no allegations of corruption against him.
*07:40.500- 07:43.040* :  He also wants to improve women's rights
*07:43.340- 07:47.420* :  and he also wants to improve Iran's relations with the outside world.
*07:47.720- 07:51.320* :  I asked a GR girl from BBC Persian about the vote to turn out.
*07:51.760- 07:55.360* :  What we know is, more than 61 million Iranian will eligible
*07:55.360- 07:57.980* :  to vote in this presidential election.
*07:58.880- 08:02.220* :  Some of the news agencies close to the regime
*08:02.220- 08:07.440* :  they say the turnout most likely is something between 39 to 40%.
*08:08.160- 08:10.200* :  But what we have seen in some areas,
*08:10.340- 08:14.840* :  almost the polling stations, were empty, very unusual in Iran.
*08:14.840- 08:17.860* :  Don't forget, in Iran, in the past sometime the turnout
*08:18.300- 08:20.580* :  could have been 70%, 80%
*08:20.580- 08:23.980* :  but this time around even the Supreme Leader knows
*08:24.120- 08:27.940* :  is somehow it's like a referendum on the legitimacy
*08:27.940- 08:32.620* :  of the Islamic Republic of Iran, precisely almost two years after
*08:32.620- 08:37.100* :  the mass protest after the killing of Masajina Amini in Iran.
*08:37.120- 08:39.040* :  There was a mass protest across the country.
*08:39.040- 08:44.600* :  Many groups, many political figures, opposition outside of Iran,
*08:44.600- 08:47.740* :  they called to boycott this election.
*08:47.740- 08:50.520* :  But obviously inside the country, so many people,
*08:50.520- 08:52.220* :  their situation is so dire.
*08:52.580- 08:56.140* :  Some people they believe, really, if they vote something might
*08:56.140- 08:57.220* :  change the situation.
*08:57.220- 08:59.680* :  Obviously, there are a group of people also loyal
*08:59.680- 09:03.140* :  to the Islamic Republic of Iran, but we know for sure
*09:03.440- 09:06.360* :  less than 50% of the population have voted so far.
*09:06.520- 09:07.720* :  Other votes counted fairly.
*09:08.280- 09:11.120* :  We don't know it yet, the Iranian election never
*09:11.120- 09:12.800* :  been fair and transparent.
*09:12.800- 09:15.720* :  Don't forget, even these four people who are running,
*09:16.340- 09:18.540* :  they have to be chosen by Guardian Council.
*09:18.540- 09:20.640* :  The Guardian Council members were being chosen
*09:20.640- 09:23.900* :  by Supreme Leader, so one person which they say is a reformist.
*09:23.900- 09:26.080* :  Actually, in fact, he's not that reformist.
*09:26.080- 09:28.480* :  That was the only choice the reformist had
*09:28.740- 09:30.580* :  and they were hoping if they vote for him,
*09:30.800- 09:32.000* :  he might be different than the others.
*09:32.260- 09:35.100* :  That was going to be my next question, Mr. Pazeshkiyan.
*09:35.820- 09:37.980* :  Is he going to be any different if were he elected?
*09:38.520- 09:41.520* :  Well, so far, don't forget Pazeshkiyan himself is a heart surgeon.
*09:42.060- 09:44.520* :  And he has been MP in the parliament for many years,
*09:44.520- 09:47.700* :  but openly he said he is very loyal to Supreme Leader.
*09:47.700- 09:48.780* :  He has to say it.
*09:48.780- 09:51.200* :  He will be acting within his guidance.
*09:51.820- 09:54.480* :  But what he has said so far is quite different
*09:54.480- 09:57.780* :  than other candidates who are ultra-right conservative
*09:58.200- 09:59.480* :  Islam is close to Supreme Leader.
*09:59.860- 10:02.480* :  He criticized the way they have been dealing
*10:02.480- 10:03.800* :  with protesters in the street.
*10:03.800- 10:07.560* :  He criticized imposing Islamic rules on women.
*10:07.720- 10:11.960* :  He criticized so many policies because of the lock of
*10:12.200- 10:13.900* :  expert being in a right place.
*10:13.920- 10:15.780* :  He criticized the system for corruption.
*10:16.140- 10:19.320* :  So that's why many people inside Iran,
*10:19.320- 10:21.180* :  they thought if they vote for him,
*10:21.600- 10:24.180* :  it might be a chance, it's something might change.
*10:24.180- 10:27.120* :  But if those people who are looking at the situation Iran,
*10:27.120- 10:29.600* :  they know it is the Supreme Leader
*10:29.600- 10:32.540* :  and revolutionary guards call the shot not the president.
*10:33.160- 10:33.920* :  G.R. Goll.
*10:34.960- 10:37.720* :  A roof fat India's Delhi airport has collapsed,
*10:37.720- 10:40.680* :  following heavy rain and floods killing one person
*10:40.680- 10:42.320* :  and injuring four others.
*10:42.740- 10:45.300* :  Videos online showed huge pillars supporting
*10:45.300- 10:47.580* :  the roof smashing into cars parked along
*10:47.580- 10:49.100* :  the airport's terminal one.
*10:49.680- 10:51.220* :  Here's what a passenger had to say.
*10:53.940- 10:55.760* :  We just heard that a roof has collapsed
*10:55.760- 10:58.380* :  and as a result many flights have been canceled
*10:58.380- 11:00.260* :  and some have been put on hold.
*11:00.720- 11:04.160* :  No one is able to tell us what exactly is happening.
*11:04.820- 11:06.520* :  They're asking us to go to another terminal,
*11:06.520- 11:09.040* :  but we're not getting any clear information.
*11:09.040- 11:10.400* :  I don't know what information to happen with me.
*11:11.140- 11:13.080* :  Also in Delhi is our correspondent
*11:13.080- 11:14.680* :  John Barassan at Erosion.
*11:15.160- 11:18.700* :  It came as a big embarrassment for the officials here in Delhi
*11:19.000- 11:22.600* :  when a section of the roof outside the departure hall
*11:22.600- 11:25.460* :  in terminal one in Delhi airport collapsed.
*11:26.100- 11:28.480* :  Many flights were suspended and later on
*11:28.680- 11:31.200* :  the aviation companies, Jailin Company,
*11:31.200- 11:34.020* :  said they were moving their operations to other terminals
*11:34.020- 11:36.200* :  which were operating as usual.
*11:36.800- 11:39.520* :  But now the government has formed a technical committee
*11:39.520- 11:41.280* :  to find out what went wrong.
*11:41.280- 11:43.520* :  But if you see the pictures on social media,
*11:44.080- 11:47.020* :  how these very heavy steel girders
*11:47.200- 11:50.140* :  just fell down on vehicles waiting outside
*11:50.660- 11:51.980* :  trapping many people.
*11:52.240- 11:55.940* :  And this is also an embarrassment for the governing BJP here
*11:55.940- 11:57.900* :  because the entire terminal building,
*11:58.220- 11:59.760* :  not the roof which collapsed,
*12:00.280- 12:02.560* :  was refurbished only a few months ago.
*12:02.780- 12:05.740* :  Ahead of the elections by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
*12:06.260- 12:09.960* :  So this raises questions about audit of safety standards
*12:09.960- 12:12.700* :  and the quality of construction in India itself
*12:12.700- 12:13.720* :  or mega projects.
*12:14.320- 12:16.540* :  But the government says that this section of the roof
*12:16.540- 12:20.500* :  which collapsed was built around 2008 and 2009
*12:21.120- 12:23.820* :  when Congress was in power, which is now in opposition.
*12:24.060- 12:25.880* :  I mean, it was heavy rain.
*12:26.160- 12:27.460* :  There's been lots of floods in India.
*12:27.460- 12:30.000* :  But roofs like that should not collapse,
*12:30.000- 12:32.580* :  especially in public buildings like airports.
*12:32.580- 12:34.800* :  This presumably raises a lot of questions.
*12:35.540- 12:38.900* :  India has been on a big drive to double the number of airports
*12:38.900- 12:42.660* :  and increase air connectivity between the huge cities.
*12:42.660- 12:45.480* :  There's a vast country and more and more people
*12:45.480- 12:48.280* :  are now traveling by air that reducing distance.
*12:48.280- 12:51.760* :  India also wants to rival the by and Singapore
*12:51.760- 12:53.500* :  in terms of air connectivity.
*12:54.040- 12:56.220* :  In fact, after Mr. Modi came to power,
*12:56.220- 12:58.560* :  the number of operationalized airports
*12:58.560- 13:00.820* :  have doubled the smaller ones have become bigger.
*13:01.400- 13:04.860* :  So there is a real rush to get this infrastructure up and running.
*13:05.060- 13:06.820* :  But that also raises the question,
*13:06.820- 13:10.360* :  how far these huge infrastructure projects
*13:10.940- 13:13.720* :  are being scrutinized and what kind of mechanism
*13:13.720- 13:16.380* :  to monitor them while they were being constructed?
*13:16.380- 13:19.200* :  You know, in fact, this morning I saw last night
*13:19.200- 13:21.480* :  there was rain and many of these underposses
*13:21.480- 13:24.300* :  in the capital city, a city of 20 million people
*13:24.300- 13:27.040* :  where the Indian government sits were flooded.
*13:27.040- 13:28.620* :  There was chaos of traffic.
*13:28.620- 13:32.260* :  People are putting pictures, particularly members of parliament.
*13:32.260- 13:34.420* :  They were saying, now I am just waiting
*13:34.420- 13:36.960* :  through needy water to get into my car.
*13:36.960- 13:38.780* :  I even cannot come out of my house
*13:38.780- 13:41.320* :  because the water has entered the houses.
*13:41.780- 13:44.080* :  So we are talking about the heart of the capital
*13:44.080- 13:46.400* :  where these flood waters have entered houses.
*13:46.400- 13:49.740* :  So the questions are, what happens about the drainage system?
*13:49.740- 13:52.280* :  Why they were not even looking into the system
*13:52.740- 13:55.380* :  when everyone knows these are pre-monsoon rains
*13:55.380- 13:58.060* :  and monsoon rains are going to come in the next few weeks?
*13:58.420- 13:59.860* :  Ambarasan, etharajan.
*14:00.720- 14:03.760* :  Maurice Ravel's Balero is perhaps one of the most
*14:03.760- 14:06.200* :  famous pieces of ballet music in the world.
*14:06.400- 14:08.420* :  It was an instant heat when it was first performed
*14:08.420- 14:11.000* :  at the Paris Opera in 1928.
*14:11.520- 14:14.240* :  And although Ravel died almost a decade later,
*14:14.240- 14:16.640* :  his heirs earned millions of dollars
*14:16.640- 14:19.380* :  until the copyright ran out in 2016
*14:19.860- 14:21.660* :  and the work passed into the public domain.
*14:22.000- 14:24.340* :  Now, various interested parties say
*14:24.340- 14:27.820* :  that Ravel had co-writers on the piece, which would mean
*14:28.480- 14:31.940* :  it should be back in copyright and earning them royalties.
*14:32.320- 14:35.100* :  Now, a court in France has ruled that he was indeed
*14:35.100- 14:37.960* :  the sole writer, Emily Kilpatrick's biography
*14:37.960- 14:40.640* :  on Maurice Ravel is to be released next year.
*14:40.940- 14:43.960* :  Johnny Diamond asked her what the copyright rouse said
*14:44.300- 14:45.200* :  about the composition.
*14:45.780- 14:49.220* :  Balero itself, finally enough, was born out of a rights issue
*14:49.220- 14:51.120* :  because Ravel had originally planned
*14:51.220- 14:53.740* :  to arrange some music by a Spanish composer.
*14:53.740- 14:55.840* :  He was all about ready to do this
*14:55.920- 14:58.000* :  and then he found that somebody else had the rights
*14:58.000- 15:00.080* :  to Aldenith and so he couldn't use that
*15:00.100- 15:01.240* :  and he was apparently furious.
*15:01.520- 15:04.540* :  So he turned, he said, to a tune that he'd had an idea
*15:04.540- 15:07.100* :  that he'd had and created this work Balero.
*15:07.220- 15:08.820* :  So the work strangely enough was born
*15:08.820- 15:10.200* :  out of a copyright issue
*15:10.360- 15:11.700* :  and that's something that stayed with it
*15:11.760- 15:12.680* :  all its long history.
*15:12.880- 15:18.160* :  Did Ravel expect this to be the kind of hit that it became?
*15:18.900- 15:19.740* :  Not at all.
*15:19.920- 15:22.680* :  There's a wonderful story of him talking to the conductor
*15:22.720- 15:26.040* :  Ernest Anson, a who claimed he found the work wonderful.
*15:26.040- 15:27.920* :  And Ravel said to him, I can't think why.
*15:29.140- 15:31.560* :  There were plenty of other stories like that.
*15:31.560- 15:34.620* :  He was certainly quite than used by the fact
*15:34.620- 15:36.980* :  that this above all things was he is greater success
*15:37.580- 15:40.060* :  but truly it is a fabulous tune.
*15:40.100- 15:42.220* :  There's something that the sinuousness of it
*15:42.560- 15:45.060* :  it's sort of simple, but it just tugs at your ears.
*15:50.880- 15:54.540* :  Ravel, for all he was deeply self-deplicating
*15:54.540- 15:55.380* :  about it's success.
*15:55.800- 15:57.980* :  He was on French radio in about 1932
*15:57.980- 16:01.000* :  and he talked about walking past a building site the next day
*16:01.000- 16:03.940* :  and hearing some factory workers whistling his tune.
*16:04.700- 16:06.840* :  And that was kind of one of his most startling
*16:06.920- 16:10.160* :  and probably quite satisfying moments in his cold career.
*16:13.980- 16:18.300* :  What really makes it is this wonderful kind of combination
*16:18.340- 16:20.820* :  the tension between the rigorous tune
*16:20.820- 16:22.760* :  that keeps repeating and repeating.
*16:23.600- 16:27.360* :  And as the work progresses, more and more sound,
*16:27.360- 16:29.240* :  more dissonance, tension.
*16:30.000- 16:32.220* :  So for all of this time, we've been in C Major
*16:32.680- 16:35.380* :  and suddenly right at the end, he slams you into E Major
*16:35.380- 16:38.160* :  and you're just unexpectedly in his new key for a few bars.
*16:49.320- 16:51.720* :  The tension there, it's unsupportable
*16:51.720- 16:54.320* :  it's like the whole weight of the orchestra is pressing on it
*16:54.720- 16:56.300* :  and it collapses at the end
*16:56.300- 17:00.060* :  and it's this amazing combination of this almost mechanized
*17:00.060- 17:02.760* :  at the break down of a machine, but it's so human
*17:02.800- 17:04.340* :  and so sensuous as well
*17:04.340- 17:07.420* :  and it's something about that combination that makes it.
*17:07.680- 17:08.500* :  So it's extraordinary.
*17:13.260- 17:16.820* :  Emily Kielpatrick on the beauty of Polaro.
*17:18.540- 17:20.140* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*17:20.600- 17:22.120* :  Previously, one or two kids had a phone
*17:22.240- 17:24.320* :  but now most kids have access to a phone.
*17:24.480- 17:25.680* :  The context overwhelms us.
*17:25.780- 17:27.840* :  It is difficult to offer them quality of life
*17:27.840- 17:29.140* :  when there is no food at home
*17:29.140- 17:31.420* :  and in this place, they offer you three meals a day
*17:31.420- 17:33.580* :  and they're going to give you money on top of that.
*17:34.020- 17:37.860* :  The Colombian schoolchildren being lured by rebels on TikTok.
*17:45.300- 17:46.600* :  Ryan Reynolds here from InMobile.
*17:46.820- 17:49.680* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation,
*17:49.680- 17:51.900* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*17:52.320- 17:54.900* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer
*17:54.920- 17:56.140* :  which is apparently a thing.
*17:56.560- 17:58.440* :  Mid-Mobile unlimited premium wireless.
*17:58.680- 18:01.740* :  30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,

*18:15.600- 18:18.740* :  Welcome to the Bright Side, a new kind of daily podcast
*18:18.740- 18:21.980* :  from Hello Sunshine hosted by me, Danielle Robe

*18:27.220- 18:30.940* :  the latest trends, inspiration, and so much more.

*18:39.480- 18:41.280* :  Listen to the Bright Side from Hello Sunshine
*18:41.280- 18:44.660* :  on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:51.260- 18:54.820* :  In Greek mythology, Pegasus was a winged white stallion,
*18:54.820- 18:58.640* :  a symbol of poetic inspiration or the souls in mortality.
*18:59.260- 19:02.400* :  In recent years, though, it's got a grubbier reputation
*19:02.540- 19:05.700* :  as the name of a notorious Israeli-made spyware
*19:05.700- 19:07.760* :  that various governments have used to keep tabs
*19:07.760- 19:11.860* :  and worse on journalists, lawyers, and political opponents.
*19:11.860- 19:15.000* :  On Friday, that reputation resurfaced in Poland
*19:15.040- 19:18.920* :  as MPs voted to lift the immunity of a former deputy justice
*19:18.920- 19:22.620* :  minister over allegations that he helped by the software
*19:23.040- 19:25.560* :  in order to hack the phones of government critics.
*19:26.080- 19:28.360* :  To find out more, I've been speaking to our correspondent
*19:28.360- 19:30.540* :  in Warsaw, Adam Eastern.
*19:31.160- 19:34.860* :  Mejavosh was the deputy justice minister
*19:35.920- 19:39.460* :  under the previous right-wing law and justice government,
*19:40.340- 19:42.960* :  which lost power in October's parliamentary elections.
*19:43.080- 19:45.760* :  And the allegation is that he authorized,
*19:45.780- 19:48.480* :  as deputy justice minister, 2017,
*19:49.280- 19:52.480* :  the transfer of more than six million dollars
*19:52.840- 19:56.540* :  from the Justice Fund, which was a fund set up
*19:56.540- 19:58.740* :  to help the victims of crime.
*19:59.860- 20:02.440* :  He sent that money to an anti-corruption bureau
*20:03.200- 20:07.120* :  so they could buy this Israeli-made Pegasus spyware,
*20:07.600- 20:11.460* :  which the allegations are it was used to hack the phones
*20:11.460- 20:15.660* :  of hundreds of people, including government critics,
*20:16.520- 20:19.960* :  including the election campaign chief
*20:20.680- 20:22.580* :  of the main opposition party then.
*20:23.280- 20:26.340* :  And now his immunity has been lifted as an MP.
*20:26.780- 20:27.860* :  He can now be charged.
*20:27.940- 20:31.180* :  And if he is found guilty of abusing his power,
*20:31.180- 20:33.680* :  he could face up to 10 years in prison.
*20:33.920- 20:35.920* :  What does he say about the allegations?
*20:36.480- 20:37.300* :  He says the rubbish.
*20:37.640- 20:40.920* :  Basically, he says even today, everything I did
*20:40.920- 20:42.200* :  was absolutely legal.
*20:42.200- 20:44.880* :  He said, and he would do it again, in fact, he said,
*20:44.940- 20:50.220* :  because this spyware, he said, was bought to tackle
*20:50.220- 20:53.720* :  organized crime and catch pedophiles and murderers
*20:53.720- 20:54.380* :  was what he said.
*20:54.380- 20:57.720* :  So he has no regrets at all about his behavior.
*20:58.100- 20:59.140* :  Because that's the thing, isn't it?
*20:59.140- 21:01.260* :  This software is on sale to governments,
*21:01.320- 21:02.920* :  and it's supporters.
*21:02.920- 21:05.800* :  This is obviously disputed, but it's supporters say
*21:05.800- 21:07.400* :  it can be used completely legitimately.
*21:07.400- 21:10.180* :  So is this political score settling
*21:10.180- 21:13.260* :  on the part of the relatively new Polish government,
*21:13.260- 21:15.680* :  or does it suggest that the previous government
*21:15.680- 21:17.840* :  broke the bounds of acceptable behavior?
*21:18.140- 21:20.960* :  Well, there are several figures who claim
*21:20.960- 21:24.060* :  that they have evidence that their phones were hacked
*21:24.280- 21:25.140* :  during this time.
*21:25.500- 21:28.980* :  And at the moment, it's the victims who say they were victims,
*21:29.000- 21:32.020* :  their word against the previous government,
*21:32.020- 21:35.520* :  so who insisted they didn't use it against their critics.
*21:36.240- 21:38.120* :  Adam Eastern in Warsaw.
*21:39.340- 21:41.880* :  Fighters from dissident armed groups in Colombia
*21:41.880- 21:45.180* :  are using TikTok to glorify their lives as gorillas
*21:45.400- 21:46.700* :  and recruit youngsters.
*21:47.160- 21:49.680* :  Their videos seem to offer the promise of money,
*21:49.680- 21:52.700* :  parties and adventures, just to direct message away.
*21:52.920- 21:55.720* :  Hundreds of comments on TikTok asking how to join
*21:55.720- 21:57.020* :  show this huge interest.
*21:57.560- 21:59.280* :  What the videos don't emphasize,
*21:59.280- 22:02.100* :  however, are the dangers associated with being
*22:02.100- 22:05.100* :  in an armed gorilla group, BBC Trending,
*22:05.100- 22:06.240* :  has been investigating.
*22:06.820- 22:08.100* :  Here's Rochelle Craigier.
*22:10.720- 22:13.100* :  The song you're hearing comes from a gorilla recruitment
*22:13.100- 22:14.360* :  video on TikTok.
*22:14.840- 22:17.200* :  Experts have told me that social media has played
*22:17.200- 22:20.420* :  an important role in learning kids to join these armed groups.
*22:20.920- 22:22.540* :  In order to research this story,
*22:22.540- 22:25.280* :  I started by watching only a few dissident videos
*22:25.280- 22:27.860* :  with my colleague, but since TikTok quickly learns
*22:27.860- 22:30.180* :  which videos you watch and how much time
*22:30.180- 22:33.180* :  you spend watching them, soon the apps algorithm
*22:33.180- 22:35.640* :  was pumping more and more gorilla videos
*22:35.860- 22:37.020* :  onto our four-year feeds.
*22:38.460- 22:41.820* :  Some of the TikTok videos we found actively offered jobs
*22:41.820- 22:43.820* :  while others showed what they portray
*22:43.820- 22:45.920* :  as a slice of life inside the gorillas.
*22:46.320- 22:50.180* :  Money, cars, guns, women, community and purpose.
*22:50.660- 22:53.040* :  They don't emphasize the dangers of being involved
*22:53.040- 22:54.180* :  in a gorilla militia.
*22:54.600- 22:57.080* :  You're about to hear from a woman we're calling Lorena,
*22:57.360- 23:00.420* :  a teacher from rural Kauka in southwestern Colombia.
*23:00.800- 23:02.440* :  We're not going to tell you her real name
*23:02.440- 23:05.480* :  or where she teaches or even use her real voice.
*23:05.900- 23:08.120* :  Many families in her community know someone
*23:08.120- 23:10.120* :  who is involved with the dissident armed groups
*23:10.280- 23:13.020* :  and speaking out could mean trouble for her and her family.
*23:13.300- 23:15.340* :  When I arrived here almost six years ago,
*23:15.460- 23:17.220* :  the children did not dare talk about it
*23:17.220- 23:18.580* :  so openly in the classroom.
*23:18.900- 23:20.780* :  Lorena says a few years ago,
*23:20.780- 23:23.480* :  her teenage students started cheering social media posts
*23:23.480- 23:26.800* :  with music glorifying Colombia's dissident gorilla groups.
*23:27.200- 23:29.220* :  These are armed groups that didn't like the terms
*23:29.220- 23:31.700* :  of a peace treaty negotiated between the FARC
*23:31.820- 23:33.380* :  and the government in 2016.
*23:33.760- 23:35.920* :  So they kept fighting against the Colombian government
*23:35.920- 23:37.260* :  and the security forces.
*23:37.700- 23:39.920* :  Most of them are now grouped in what has been dubbed
*23:39.920- 23:42.600* :  the Estalo Mayor Central, the EMC
*23:42.840- 23:44.800* :  or the latest iteration of the FARC.
*23:44.980- 23:47.460* :  Reportedly, they make their money from illegal businesses.
*23:47.940- 23:50.680* :  Lorena says at least 15 students from her school
*23:50.680- 23:52.500* :  left to join the gorillas.
*23:52.960- 23:55.220* :  After the pandemic, it became overwhelming for us.
*23:55.520- 23:57.080* :  Previously, one or two kids had a phone,
*23:57.140- 24:00.000* :  but now most kids have access to a phone with the internet
*24:00.220- 24:01.700* :  and they're on their cell phone all the time.
*24:02.120- 24:03.860* :  Unfortunately, one or two started trend
*24:03.960- 24:05.460* :  and it becomes fashionable in the classroom.
*24:06.000- 24:09.040* :  Lorena says sometimes after a student has been missing
*24:09.040- 24:10.600* :  from her class for a couple of days,
*24:10.600- 24:12.840* :  they suddenly reappear on social media,
*24:12.840- 24:15.800* :  making videos of themselves wearing battle uniforms,
*24:15.900- 24:19.540* :  holding rifles and that's when parents and teachers know
*24:19.960- 24:21.560* :  they've joined the dissident FARC groups.
*24:21.780- 24:23.240* :  I think they do this because they're not aware
*24:23.240- 24:25.700* :  or they're not trying to be careful in the end,
*24:25.700- 24:27.620* :  they're all children and they think it's brave
*24:27.620- 24:28.940* :  to post something like this.
*24:29.520- 24:30.780* :  The context overwhelms us.
*24:30.860- 24:32.920* :  It is difficult to offer them quality of life,
*24:32.920- 24:35.680* :  give them other opportunities when there is no food at home
*24:35.680- 24:37.940* :  and in this place, they offer you three meals a day
*24:37.940- 24:40.060* :  and they're going to give you money on top of that.
*24:40.500- 24:43.400* :  Even the EMC itself is trying to stop its young members
*24:43.400- 24:46.460* :  from showing off on TikTok according to Sebastien Martinez.
*24:46.940- 24:49.440* :  He's a guerrilla member of the Western block commander
*24:49.440- 24:52.400* :  Hakoa Arenas of the EMC in Kauka.
*24:52.740- 24:55.080* :  He has been representing the group in negotiations
*24:55.080- 24:57.520* :  with the government that have for now stalled.
*24:58.860- 25:02.220* :  I first met the FARC when it was just four years old
*25:02.420- 25:04.200* :  and they taught me how to ride a bike.
*25:04.520- 25:06.400* :  I saw the work they did in the communities.
*25:06.780- 25:08.600* :  We spoke to Sebastien over Zoom.
*25:08.920- 25:11.200* :  He admitted that EMC FARC make their money
*25:11.200- 25:13.340* :  from illegal activities like taxing people
*25:13.340- 25:14.760* :  who have cocaine or poppy crops.
*25:15.240- 25:16.900* :  I challenged him on whether his group
*25:16.900- 25:18.540* :  are forcibly recruiting anyone.
*25:18.960- 25:21.820* :  He says not, but he acknowledges that they do actively
*25:21.820- 25:24.340* :  recruit boys and girls as young as 15 years old.
*25:24.800- 25:27.920* :  And when we asked about how the EMC FARC used social media,
*25:28.220- 25:29.780* :  he said, although they will publish
*25:29.780- 25:32.040* :  certain official statements on different platforms,
*25:32.040- 25:35.180* :  their recruitment tactics are not based on social media.
*25:35.560- 25:38.400* :  He doesn't approve of the TikTok some fighters have been posting.
*25:39.640- 25:42.380* :  Some comrades, for example, let's say they take a video
*25:42.380- 25:44.440* :  of themselves that is very pretty
*25:44.640- 25:46.420* :  because they show how happy they are.
*25:46.860- 25:48.940* :  But then in that video you show a mountain
*25:48.940- 25:50.520* :  and you're showing where you are.
*25:51.020- 25:53.000* :  And intelligent services can say,
*25:53.280- 25:56.040* :  oh, this person was recruited by a certain commander.
*25:56.540- 25:59.020* :  And even if that commander doesn't even have TikTok,
*25:59.440- 26:00.860* :  they are able to find them.
*26:00.980- 26:04.420* :  We contacted TikTok for a comment, but we didn't get a reply.
*26:04.800- 26:07.580* :  However, their community guidelines say, quote,
*26:07.940- 26:10.720* :  TikTok is not a place to spread beliefs or propaganda
*26:10.720- 26:12.880* :  that encourage violence or hate.
*26:13.300- 26:15.080* :  We did not allow the presence of violence
*26:15.080- 26:18.200* :  in hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.
*26:18.900- 26:21.180* :  That report was from Rochelle Craigier
*26:21.180- 26:24.120* :  and hear more on this story search for the documentary
*26:24.640- 26:26.400* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*26:27.800- 26:32.460* :  One of the main issues that puts people off buying electric cars
*26:32.460- 26:34.040* :  is how long it takes to charge.
*26:34.040- 26:36.780* :  It can be hours, certainly much longer
*26:36.780- 26:39.320* :  than the five minute stop at a petrol station.
*26:39.460- 26:41.380* :  But a UK company, Naomi Bolt,
*26:41.380- 26:44.200* :  has come up with a super fast charging battery
*26:44.200- 26:47.100* :  that its co-founder, Sai Shiva Ready,
*26:47.440- 26:49.080* :  says could be a game changer.
*26:49.560- 26:52.240* :  This is a big milestone for, I believe,
*26:52.240- 26:54.420* :  the experience has to be transitioned to clean energy.
*26:54.700- 26:57.440* :  Ultimately, the vision is to get mainstream fast charging
*26:57.440- 27:00.260* :  possible and having to wait for charges, I think,
*27:00.260- 27:00.840* :  of the past.
*27:01.140- 27:03.520* :  So how significant is this development?
*27:04.020- 27:05.480* :  All of a con way has been speaking
*27:05.480- 27:08.320* :  to Zoe Kleinman, our technology editor.
*27:08.800- 27:10.400* :  What this company is trying to do
*27:10.400- 27:14.220* :  is to address what it describes as range anxiety.
*27:14.220- 27:16.820* :  And that is the kind of fear of how far
*27:16.820- 27:18.660* :  your electric vehicle will be able to go
*27:18.660- 27:20.140* :  before you have to charge it.
*27:20.480- 27:23.260* :  And it's doing that by looking at a battery
*27:23.260- 27:25.400* :  that can charge extremely quickly.
*27:25.840- 27:28.780* :  So it's just carried out a test track of its battery.
*27:29.200- 27:33.000* :  And on the day, it was put inside this very fancy
*27:33.000- 27:35.820* :  Columncept sports car and it managed to charge it
*27:35.820- 27:40.020* :  from 10% to 80% in four minutes and 37 seconds.
*27:40.500- 27:43.100* :  Now, if you compare that with the existing supercharger,
*27:43.100- 27:46.100* :  say that Tesla offers, it does about the same in 15
*27:46.100- 27:48.020* :  to 20 minutes, which is still fast,
*27:48.080- 27:50.300* :  but this is considerably faster.
*27:50.320- 27:52.420* :  And the idea is to bring it back in line
*27:52.800- 27:54.300* :  with what you're kind of used to doing
*27:54.300- 27:56.840* :  when you have to refuel a traditional vehicle.
*27:57.100- 28:00.040* :  Yeah, and how have they been able to make it so quick?
*28:00.620- 28:03.460* :  There's various tech that's gone on behind the scenes.
*28:03.500- 28:06.120* :  It's still a lithium ion battery at heart.
*28:06.120- 28:09.220* :  So we have seen lots of other innovation in this space
*28:09.220- 28:11.620* :  because there is a kind of global race isn't there
*28:11.620- 28:14.960* :  to make our batteries more powerful, more durable
*28:15.020- 28:16.880* :  and also quicker to recharge.
*28:16.980- 28:20.560* :  There was some really interesting news from Toyota earlier
*28:20.560- 28:23.780* :  this year, which claims that it has made a breakthrough
*28:23.780- 28:26.800* :  in battery tech that will one day enable it to make a battery
*28:26.800- 28:31.140* :  that can charge in 10 minutes and go for over 1,000 kilometers.
*28:31.600- 28:34.280* :  But that is using a completely new form of tech.
*28:34.280- 28:35.580* :  It's called a solid state battery,
*28:35.580- 28:37.980* :  whereas this battery isn't trying to do something
*28:37.980- 28:39.120* :  completely new if you like.
*28:39.140- 28:40.960* :  It's doing something different with the tech
*28:40.980- 28:42.160* :  that we already have.
*28:42.480- 28:44.680* :  And the advantage of that is that, obviously,
*28:44.680- 28:46.460* :  a lot of the research is already done
*28:46.460- 28:48.540* :  so it can be rolled out a lot more quickly.
*28:48.540- 28:51.960* :  And also it's compatible with existing super fast charges.
*28:52.540- 28:54.700* :  The only issue is that there aren't loads of those
*28:54.700- 28:56.160* :  around in every country.
*28:56.160- 28:59.680* :  So there's definitely an infrastructure catch-up problem
*28:59.680- 29:00.800* :  that we have as well.
*29:00.840- 29:05.500* :  But there are petrol stations dotted around all main highways,
*29:05.500- 29:07.740* :  but do they all have charges
*29:07.920- 29:09.860* :  and do they all have super fast charges
*29:09.860- 29:13.140* :  that will make people able to get back on the road more quickly?
*29:13.140- 29:15.940* :  So it's not just a question of changing the battery.
*29:15.940- 29:18.280* :  It's a question of changing everything that's around it.
*29:18.280- 29:20.740* :  But I think what NIO Bolt has demonstrated is
*29:21.120- 29:24.620* :  this is a rare example of batteries tech leaving the lab,
*29:24.620- 29:26.720* :  if you like, and they said themselves in the laboratory,
*29:26.720- 29:29.560* :  they were able to charge the battery from zero to 100%
*29:29.940- 29:31.120* :  in six minutes.
*29:31.500- 29:34.140* :  But when they actually got it out and got it into a car
*29:34.140- 29:36.780* :  and onto a road, there were all kinds of real world
*29:36.780- 29:38.180* :  conditions that played in.
*29:38.200- 29:40.160* :  So here in the UK, there was a heat wave,
*29:40.160- 29:41.940* :  so it was much hotter than it had been.
*29:42.240- 29:44.820* :  And then there was an issue with the cooling system inside the car
*29:44.820- 29:45.500* :  they were using.
*29:45.840- 29:48.440* :  And then they were using a charger that just happened to be there.
*29:48.440- 29:49.820* :  It wasn't one that they built themselves.
*29:49.820- 29:53.040* :  So with all of this innovation, you have to bear in mind
*29:53.040- 29:55.740* :  that when it's actually in your car outside your house,
*29:55.740- 29:58.200* :  it's not going to necessarily behave as perfectly
*29:58.640- 29:59.640* :  as it did in the laboratory.
*29:59.640- 30:02.740* :  But they've described it as a milestone for electrification,
*30:02.740- 30:05.060* :  which is a very encouraging way of looking at it.
*30:05.380- 30:06.500* :  Zoe Kleinman.
*30:07.540- 30:10.980* :  Before he was an actor, let alone an Oscar-winning one,
*30:11.020- 30:14.900* :  Russell Crowe was in a band that did regular gigs in pubs
*30:14.900- 30:16.760* :  and clubs and had a recording contract.
*30:17.020- 30:19.380* :  At the age of 60, Russell Crowe's career
*30:19.380- 30:22.680* :  has sort of come full circle, except that the venue
*30:22.680- 30:25.980* :  for his band's latest gig is one of the biggest
*30:25.980- 30:28.340* :  and most celebrated in the world.
*30:28.340- 30:30.540* :  Glaston Rufestival here in the UK.
*30:31.100- 30:32.600* :  Can you see that, babe?
*30:33.180- 30:35.540* :  You're going to take that, babe.
*30:36.700- 30:38.760* :  Can you see that, babe?
*30:38.780- 30:40.600* :  You're going to do, babe.
*30:42.400- 30:44.980* :  So the actor who is most famous for his roles
*30:44.980- 30:47.300* :  in the massive hit films, Gladiator,
*30:47.300- 30:49.260* :  a beautiful mind and Les Miserables,
*30:50.080- 30:51.120* :  has returned to music.
*30:51.120- 30:55.000* :  His band Indoor Garden Party played Glaston Brie this Saturday
*30:55.000- 30:58.340* :  and Paul Henley talked to him while he was on route
*30:58.340- 31:01.480* :  to the country and about to take off from Roe Airport.
*31:01.980- 31:04.340* :  We were on the road last year for about 30 shows
*31:04.560- 31:07.460* :  and we knew we were coming back to Italy to do some shows.
*31:07.660- 31:10.900* :  So I talked to Simon Brandt, a promoter,
*31:10.980- 31:13.560* :  and they said, look, we're going to ask you to play
*31:13.820- 31:14.440* :  at Glaston Brie.
*31:14.440- 31:15.600* :  It was pretty exciting news.
*31:16.060- 31:18.340* :  Then we had to sit on that information for about seven months
*31:19.040- 31:20.640* :  who had left the discuss that I'll tell anybody
*31:20.640- 31:22.040* :  because they do their own announcements.
*31:22.320- 31:23.600* :  So that was kind of torturous,
*31:23.660- 31:25.300* :  but yeah, it's really exciting.
*31:25.300- 31:26.580* :  Everybody in the band is really important.
*31:26.960- 31:28.900* :  And what can people expect at Glaston Brie?
*31:28.900- 31:30.360* :  How would you describe your music?
*31:30.700- 31:31.960* :  We sort of touch into gospel.
*31:31.960- 31:33.020* :  We're touching the blues.
*31:33.240- 31:35.880* :  We do the occasional dirty country song of that murder.
*31:36.060- 31:37.340* :  It's more like a reset for me then
*31:37.340- 31:39.920* :  because this is how I started, you know, like 45 years ago
*31:39.920- 31:42.440* :  out of the space that I used to do with the band.
*31:42.440- 31:45.220* :  I've been making feature films for 35 years now,
*31:45.220- 31:47.280* :  but I've always kept my connection to music
*31:47.280- 31:50.880* :  and always periodically recorded and released stuff for or two.
*31:51.400- 31:53.120* :  So it's a very natural place for me then.
*31:53.220- 31:56.380* :  What about the baggage associated with being the big movie star?
*31:56.880- 31:58.920* :  Bottle two songs at a set that just disappears
*31:59.180- 32:00.500* :  and the whole thing changes.
*32:00.920- 32:03.800* :  We do get a fair amount of ambulance chases, you know,
*32:03.860- 32:06.000* :  at our gigs, people that come along and go,
*32:06.340- 32:07.040* :  what's this all about?
*32:07.240- 32:08.940* :  But, you know, you're also going to keep in mind
*32:08.940- 32:10.620* :  that I've been doing it for such a long time
*32:11.180- 32:13.900* :  that there are people that have been following everything
*32:13.900- 32:14.480* :  I've done recently.
*32:14.540- 32:16.060* :  So they know every word of every song.
*32:16.240- 32:18.940* :  Even the cover of your album is your work, isn't it?
*32:18.960- 32:19.880* :  Just describe it.
*32:20.100- 32:21.600* :  Well, it's a photograph of a bloke
*32:21.600- 32:23.100* :  who was thinking about going for a swim
*32:23.100- 32:24.740* :  in a blue bay in the middle of winter.
*32:25.080- 32:26.520* :  And it was quite cold that morning.
*32:27.220- 32:29.120* :  Then he was just stopped there and had a think.
*32:29.120- 32:30.660* :  And so I took a photograph from behind him,
*32:30.660- 32:32.980* :  but the way the live was refracting off the water,
*32:32.980- 32:34.320* :  it's very painterly and beautiful.
*32:34.680- 32:37.140* :  It just seemed to me to fit with the idea of pros and cons
*32:37.140- 32:38.740* :  and he's very depthily contemplating
*32:38.900- 32:40.420* :  what's ahead of him and the temperature of the water.
*32:40.620- 32:42.500* :  And he was up for being on the album cover.
*32:42.500- 32:44.120* :  He gave you his permission, didn't he?
*32:44.720- 32:46.760* :  Yeah, it took me about six months to see him again, man.
*32:46.860- 32:48.040* :  So I was getting a bit worried about it
*32:48.040- 32:49.320* :  because I thought I'd definitely got to have
*32:49.320- 32:51.080* :  at least one conversation with the guy.
*32:51.300- 32:52.980* :  And then I was on my balcony and sitting there
*32:52.980- 32:54.700* :  back in a way, but I just caught up with him
*32:54.860- 32:55.780* :  around the other side of the bay
*32:55.780- 32:56.440* :  and had him chatting.
*32:56.440- 32:59.000* :  He was quite chuffed to at the thought of being on an album cover.
*32:59.680- 33:00.480* :  Russell Crowe.
*33:02.640- 33:05.020* :  And that's all from us for now,
*33:05.020- 33:08.580* :  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:08.800- 33:10.720* :  If you want to comment on this podcast

*33:33.700- 33:33.940* :  Goodbye.
*33:42.220- 33:46.080* :  Small details are big surfaces, tight corners or odd shapes,
*33:46.620- 33:48.840* :  flat, rounded, textured, or tall.
*33:49.460- 33:50.520* :  Whatever your next project,
*33:50.540- 33:53.200* :  there's a spray paint pattern that's just right
*33:53.540- 33:56.260* :  because Rustolium's new Custom Spray 5 and 1
*33:56.260- 33:58.980* :  gives you control with five different spray patterns.
*33:59.520- 34:02.860* :  So you can tackle nooks, crannies, edges and curves
*34:03.400- 34:05.880* :  without worrying about drips, runs, uneven coverage
*34:05.880- 34:07.840* :  or anything else.
*34:08.620- 34:12.220* :  Custom Spray 5 and 1, only from Rustolium.
