*01:35.320- 01:40.000* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Saturday the 22nd of June.
*01:40.000- 01:44.640* :  Four members of the billionaire Hinduja family are given jail sentences in Switzerland
*01:44.700- 01:51.280* :  for exploiting domestic servants. Ukraine says fighting to defend the strategic town of Chassiv Yar has
*01:51.280- 01:57.740* :  become extremely difficult and the Namibian High Court strikes down colonial era laws criminalising
*01:57.740- 02:07.400* :  gay sex between men. Also in the podcast, 27 years on the Kyoto Protocol is dramatized on stage.
*02:07.760- 02:14.660* :  This utterly incredible dramatic moving story when 176 countries came together and agreed
*02:14.660- 02:19.760* :  in something that really this shouldn't have agreed on. And JFK's watch goes under the hammer more
*02:19.760- 02:29.520* :  than 80 years after he lost it gambling. It is a stunning verdict. Four members of Britain's
*02:29.520- 02:34.860* :  richest family have been sentenced to jail terms of at least four years for exploiting immigrant
*02:34.860- 02:40.480* :  staff at their mansion in Switzerland. The Hinduja's thought to be worth nearly $50 billion were
*02:40.480- 02:45.680* :  accused of spending more on their pets than on the servants that they brought over from their native
*02:45.680- 02:51.940* :  India. The Swiss court cleared them of human trafficking but convicted the four of taking advantage
*02:51.940- 02:57.120* :  of vulnerable staff. Prosecutors pursued the case despite the family reaching an out-of-court settlement
*02:57.120- 03:01.480* :  with the servants. The family's lawyer said he was shocked by the sentence and would appeal.
*03:05.640- 03:10.240* :  I have the feeling that the behaviour was judged on moral grounds and not on legal grounds.
*03:11.380- 03:16.880* :  On the one hand, you have a very wealthy family and on the other poor people, objectively,
*03:16.880- 03:21.100* :  therefore it's a kind of punishment for this gap between the two groups of people.
*03:23.120- 03:27.720* :  The four Hinduja's are currently reported to be in Monaco and it's not clear if they'll be
*03:27.720- 03:33.120* :  extradited to Switzerland. I heard more about the trial from our Geneva correspondent Imogen folks.
*03:33.780- 03:39.900* :  Well, it was pretty sad depressing evidence that came out in this case that the Hinduja's were
*03:39.900- 03:46.880* :  paying these staff really a pittance, a fraction of what the Geneva minimum wages were talking
*03:46.880- 03:53.220* :  things like seven or eight dollars a day. And this was paid directly to accounts in India in
*03:53.220- 03:59.740* :  Rupees, so the staff couldn't even access it. One of the complainants testified that she worked
*03:59.740- 04:05.900* :  for them for years but had to sleep in a cellar and that they were restricted from leaving the house.
*04:06.620- 04:12.680* :  So a very, very depressing story. Yeah, will the Hinduja's go to jail? Well, that's what the
*04:12.680- 04:16.640* :  judge has asked for. We were a bit surprised that during this covering this case we thought,
*04:16.640- 04:22.060* :  well, there'd be a big fine possibly, but the judge has asked for custodial sentences of up to
*04:22.060- 04:30.280* :  four and a half years for all four of them. Now, of course, it appears none of them are in Switzerland,
*04:30.280- 04:35.960* :  although the younger two Hinduja's were in court this week. They're reportedly all four in Monaco,
*04:35.960- 04:41.720* :  it's not clear whether they will be extradited to Switzerland. Their defence lawyer has suggested
*04:41.720- 04:48.300* :  also that they will appeal. Does this case have wide implications for the treatment of domestic
*04:49.200- 04:55.060* :  in Switzerland? I think it's going to be a warning to some of the very wealthy people in Geneva
*04:55.800- 05:00.000* :  that the authorities in Geneva aren't going to tolerate this anymore because frankly,
*05:00.000- 05:06.440* :  it's a bit of an open secret that this kind of thing happens. It's not the first case that I or
*05:06.440- 05:13.340* :  many of my colleagues have heard of that they're very, very wealthy people, business people or
*05:13.340- 05:19.540* :  people who stay in the five-star hotels, who bring servants from their home country sometimes and
*05:19.540- 05:24.660* :  then treat them very badly. And I think the authorities in Geneva with this case are saying,
*05:25.480- 05:30.260* :  no, that's not how things are done. If families lawyer say they will appeal, what would be the
*05:30.260- 05:34.840* :  likely time frame for that kind of thing? Could be quite a long time. We've literally just had
*05:34.840- 05:41.840* :  this verdict in the last couple of hours and it was a surprise to all of us who'd expected to see
*05:41.840- 05:46.600* :  the younger two enduges again in court, as we saw them already this week, that they weren't there.
*05:46.860- 05:53.020* :  Now, as I said, we hear all four of them are in Monaco. So it could take quite a while, but the
*05:53.020- 06:00.760* :  prosecutor has asked for this custodial sentence and for the younger two enduges at least to be
*06:00.760- 06:07.760* :  detained pending that. Imagine folks in Switzerland. One of Russia's war aims in Ukraine is to take the
*06:07.760- 06:12.800* :  whole of the Donbass, as part of its offensive, their Russian troops fought too long and bloody
*06:12.800- 06:17.920* :  battles for the cities of Bakhmut and Avdevka. But their current assault on the much smaller
*06:17.920- 06:23.980* :  chassivia could be more strategically important. The invaders have been trying to take the hilltop
*06:23.980- 06:29.300* :  town, about 10 kilometers west of Bakhmut since February. But the fighting has now become
*06:29.300- 06:34.680* :  extremely difficult, according to Ukrainian units redeployed there, with Russians trying to
*06:34.680- 06:39.700* :  attack both head-on and to encircle the town. I heard more from Vitaly Shevchenko,
*06:39.700- 06:45.860* :  Russia editor at BBC Monitoring. Ukrainian forces are facing a shortage of everything,
*06:45.860- 06:52.440* :  drones, medical evacuation vehicles, artillery shells, tanks. There are more Russians,
*06:52.440- 06:58.700* :  they are better equipped and okay, it costs Russia a lot as well in terms of manpower to try and
*06:58.700- 07:04.700* :  take chassiviar. But for the Ukrainians, it's a really difficult situation. And they're still facing
*07:04.700- 07:11.180* :  those shortages, despite the US unblocking that $61 billion worth of equipment. That's correct,
*07:11.200- 07:18.580* :  and we knew all along that it is going to take some time before there's a tangible difference made
*07:18.580- 07:25.040* :  by those funds released by the United States. Having said that, after the United States allowed
*07:25.040- 07:33.360* :  Ukraine to use American weaponry and ammunition to target Russian territory adjacent to the Ukrainian
*07:33.420- 07:40.260* :  cities that Russia has been targeting, there's been a decrease in bombing and shelling of
*07:40.260- 07:48.160* :  hurricane for example, which is a welcome respite for the Ukrainians. Elsewhere, one thing I keep
*07:48.160- 07:58.040* :  hearing about are massive and long power outages affecting people and cities that didn't have them
*07:58.040- 08:02.300* :  before. I've been speaking to people in Zapparysia and the east and in the capital Kiev and they're
*08:02.300- 08:09.240* :  saying every day, at least twice a day, there are outages lasting three to four hours. And this
*08:09.240- 08:17.160* :  means no lifts, in some cases no running water, no toilets, no wifi possibly, no air conditioning,
*08:17.160- 08:23.140* :  and it's getting really really hot. And even though this is summer, Ukrainians shudder thinking
*08:23.140- 08:28.660* :  about how things are going to get in the winter. If Chasivya falls to the Russians, what would that
*08:28.660- 08:36.400* :  mean for the battle for Donbass? It will open the way for Russians to other towns and cities elsewhere
*08:36.400- 08:41.020* :  in Donbass and eastern Ukraine. I know we keep talking about all these towns and cities as having
*08:41.020- 08:47.360* :  strategic importance, but Chasivya, even though it's smaller than the other towns and cities that
*08:47.360- 08:54.140* :  Russia has taken, such as Avdivka and Bahmut, it sits on top of a series of hills overlooking
*08:54.140- 09:02.380* :  terrain for miles around and it has been turned by the Ukrainians into a massive fortress
*09:02.380- 09:08.260* :  precisely because they want to stop Russians from advancing further west. So if Chasivya falls,
*09:08.260- 09:13.660* :  it opens up the way for the Russians to try and advance onto Kramatars, Kanslaviaans,
*09:13.660- 09:21.860* :  and smaller towns and villages. But overall, this would mean that Russia's slow and bloody
*09:21.860- 09:27.620* :  advance throughout eastern Ukraine, it continues. Can they hold it? Potentially, they've been
*09:27.620- 09:33.660* :  holding for months, and the hopes that all those fresh supplies will reach them before they get
*09:33.660- 09:39.340* :  overwhelmed by the Russians, but time will tell frankly. Vitaly Shevchenko from BBC Monitoring.
*09:40.040- 09:45.340* :  A man is thought to have been killed by a bear in central Japan. If confirmed, it'd be just the
*09:45.340- 09:50.260* :  latest in a surge in attacks by the creatures as they venture more often into populated areas.
*09:50.400- 09:55.440* :  I got the details from Will Leonardo. Well, this suspected attack happened in a place called Nagano,
*09:55.440- 09:59.180* :  it's a prefecture in the centre of Japan, it's picturesque, it's known for its woods and mountains.
*09:59.180- 10:04.500* :  A construction company worker went looking for a missing colleague and found his body in the forest
*10:04.500- 10:08.960* :  with large wounds to his head and back, which officials would say consistent with bear attacks.
*10:09.600- 10:14.040* :  The victim was 58 years old, and investigations are continuing, but if it's confirmed that this
*10:14.040- 10:18.440* :  was a bear attack, which it seems likely, this would be the fifth attack in the prefecture of
*10:18.440- 10:24.300* :  Nagano this month alone. Bear numbers were once in severe decline, in fact they were almost at
*10:24.300- 10:31.020* :  risk of extinction. They're back in a big way. Why are these attacks increasing now?
*10:31.600- 10:37.360* :  Stories about bears pop up now in Japanese media with incredible regularity, sometimes it's
*10:37.360- 10:41.960* :  the kind of standoff in a street or a curious bear encroaching into a garden, but more and more
*10:41.960- 10:46.800* :  as you say it sees gruesome cases of severe attacks. In the year to March, this year alone,
*10:46.800- 10:51.200* :  there were more than 200 attacks recorded across Japan, which is a record of the country and six
*10:51.200- 10:55.760* :  people died. The bears in question are mostly Asian black bears, they're native to Japan,
*10:55.760- 10:59.960* :  their numbers had once been in severe decline because of hunting, but they now number it in the
*10:59.960- 11:04.500* :  tens of thousands. And that's happened at the same time that Japan's rural population of humans
*11:04.500- 11:08.860* :  has been declining as young people moved to the cities, and obviously Japan's experiencing a
*11:08.860- 11:13.680* :  shrinking birth rate. And that's of course what scientists have described as a blurring of
*11:13.680- 11:17.720* :  traditional boundaries. These bears are competing for fewer resources that are coming out of their
*11:17.720- 11:21.860* :  traditional habitats for food, interplaces that are less populated with humans, and they also
*11:21.860- 11:26.000* :  seem to be hibernating less. For example, in Hokkaido on the north, which is actually home to
*11:26.000- 11:29.040* :  brown bears, which are bigger than the native of the black bears in other parts of Japan,
*11:29.440- 11:33.180* :  salmon numbers, which they feed on have shrunk dramatically, so they're kind of looking around
*11:33.180- 11:37.640* :  for food and more and more. And one interesting theory is the sound of children in these villages
*11:37.940- 11:41.940* :  in rural parts of Japan has traditionally been a kind of ward to keep bears at bay, you know,
*11:41.940- 11:44.700* :  the sound of them playing or whatever it might be, but there just aren't that many children
*11:44.700- 11:49.800* :  any more in places like Nagano. So what can be done to try to reduce these number of attacks?
*11:50.340- 11:54.800* :  Well, Japanese officials are kind of upping their tone, the kind of issuing warnings to say
*11:54.800- 11:59.860* :  that in some parts bears appear to be seeing humans as prey for the first time. Bears have developed
*11:59.860- 12:03.980* :  a fondness for meat, so if they've been attacking cows or the livestock are seen as particularly
*12:03.980- 12:08.900* :  dangerous. The environment ministry warns people in these areas now with regularity, so get rid
*12:08.900- 12:13.540* :  of their food waste because that can attract bears, keep their doors closed, and officials in
*12:13.540- 12:17.780* :  Toyama prefecture are even using artificial intelligence. There's a pilot system that was launched
*12:17.780- 12:22.200* :  there recently, which uses AI to help monitor bear movements through security cameras and other
*12:22.200- 12:27.000* :  forms of cameras and sends warnings to residents when they're seen. And I was talking to Will Leonardo.
*12:27.980- 12:33.080* :  The high court in Namibia has struck down two colonial era laws that criminalise
*12:33.080- 12:38.740* :  same-sex acts between men. There was no similar ban for women. The case was lodged by a
*12:38.740- 12:44.580* :  Namibian gay rights activist, the BBC's gender and identity correspondent for Africa, Esther Agola,
*12:44.580- 12:50.440* :  explain the significance of the ruling. It simply means that what meaning the LGBTQ community
*12:50.440- 12:55.980* :  would call state-sanctioned homophobia has been dropped. This basically means that no one can use
*12:55.980- 13:02.600* :  laws, including the government, to deny people rights to live together or to access any form of
*13:02.600- 13:08.060* :  service simply because they're a same-sex couple. And couples who got married outside in Namibia,
*13:08.060- 13:13.160* :  what about them? It just so happens that in 2023, and this had started even before 2023,
*13:13.740- 13:18.780* :  Natbibia's constitutional court told the government that they were obligated to recognise same-sex
*13:19.300- 13:24.940* :  marriages from foreign countries where same-sex marriages were legal. This was brought forward by two
*13:24.940- 13:30.560* :  couples who, when they got into Namibia, the government refused to give their partners residency.
*13:30.560- 13:37.400* :  And so they took it to court and the constitutional court said while they are not saying that in Namibia,
*13:37.400- 13:44.060* :  marriages between same-sex couples are recognised, marriages from other countries where same-sex
*13:44.080- 13:48.940* :  marriages are recognised will be recognised in Namibia. Give us a sense then, as you've covered
*13:48.940- 13:54.440* :  this story for many years, how significant the ruling is. Bias against the LGBTQ community
*13:54.440- 14:01.200* :  around the continent is very rampant and rife and there have been a lot of instances of discrimination,
*14:01.200- 14:06.840* :  including violence, where people have been attacked simply for being same-sex couples or for
*14:06.840- 14:12.300* :  being members of the LGBTQ community. In practical terms then, in Namibia from now on, if there is
*14:12.300- 14:17.280* :  a same-sex couple, how would they be able to live their life visibly in a different way? They
*14:17.280- 14:23.700* :  were unable to before the movement. Maybe two things. There's the law and there's also, you know,
*14:23.880- 14:30.880* :  cultural attitudes and sometimes changing the cultural attitudes is harder than changing the law.
*14:31.480- 14:38.320* :  And so what it means is I think people can now secret dress in case of anything that is against
*14:38.320- 14:44.220* :  the law, but culturally also I think people still need to, you know, sort of understand members
*14:44.220- 14:49.900* :  of the LGBTQ community. They may not necessarily be able to live fully because maybe the communities
*14:49.900- 14:55.220* :  around them have not fully accepted them and they still have bias against them, but what it means
*14:55.220- 15:00.840* :  is in case of anything, whether it's violence or discriminatory, they can now secret dress in
*15:00.840- 15:06.520* :  courts because their rights have been violated. The BBC's gender and identity correspondent for
*15:06.520- 15:13.560* :  Africa Esther Ogola talking to James Reynolds. And still to come on the global news podcast,

*16:48.140- 16:54.000* :  region of Darfur. The paramilitary rapid support forces are besieging El Fasha, the last city
*16:54.000- 16:59.740* :  there held by the regular army. One of the most important figures in Darfur is Abdul-Wahid El-Nor,

*17:05.980- 17:10.500* :  Now there are reports suggesting that large numbers of people have fled from around El Fasha
*17:10.500- 17:16.100* :  into the area controlled by Abdul-Wahid El-Nor. James Coppnell asked him if this was true.
*17:16.800- 17:22.340* :  You know that we are providing security, we are providing security very well for them,
*17:22.720- 17:30.740* :  but we are not able, because we feel helpless, that we are not able to provide shelter to
*17:30.740- 17:39.600* :  water, medicine, to the catastrophe. To the nightmare, there's a real humanitarian catastrophe
*17:40.220- 17:48.560* :  running out of any food, anything, any lively assistant to them. It is really catastrophe and
*17:48.560- 17:54.880* :  we do not only in Darfur or the Balmarra or under control area, this is across the country.
*17:55.520- 18:00.540* :  I was going to ask you about that, because all over Sudan, and we've been talking about it
*18:00.540- 18:07.640* :  for weeks now, millions of people are at risk of famine, people are struggling to find their next
*18:07.640- 18:14.320* :  meal. So what about in the areas you control, is it possible to get food in, are you able to
*18:14.320- 18:19.160* :  grow enough food to feed people, or are people starving to death?
*18:19.480- 18:26.200* :  For the moment, we don't have, because UN is very bureaucrats, and the matter of fact,
*18:26.200- 18:32.720* :  in Sudan, today, they are talking about the religion, and the matter of fact, there is a forced
*18:32.720- 18:40.660* :  of remedy in Sudan, there is SPLM North, led by General Abdul-Ajid Al-Helou, their control of
*18:41.980- 18:49.420* :  Tau-Skur-Dufan, Dufan, Dufan Mountain, and Bounal. There is Saf in Sudan and North Sudan,
*18:50.220- 18:56.040* :  and there is rabbit support force, and there is Ashu control, the region I taught you.
*18:56.920- 19:04.660* :  So this is a forced sovereignty, and I'm calling upon the national community that,
*19:04.660- 19:12.860* :  the reality is that this is a fact, we need to put to come cross-skack, cross-skack border,
*19:13.680- 19:20.280* :  it will never come from course, but not at all, it will never come there, and even if it's there,
*19:21.160- 19:28.300* :  there are not that this mentality of those who are ruling the war now, the last thing they
*19:28.300- 19:39.120* :  think is about human life and human dignity. We need from the UN to open in particular for this
*19:39.120- 19:47.220* :  new resolution, that we want our area to be accepted even, to the people and also the
*19:47.220- 19:55.880* :  foot to be distributed only to that form, but also to the Qurdufan, that there will not be a foot
*19:55.880- 20:02.600* :  for anything coming from the Qurdufan. Yeah, the Sudanese military in Port Sudan are unlikely
*20:02.600- 20:07.920* :  to want food to go to areas controlled by rebels in South Qurdufan or in Darfur.
*20:08.380- 20:15.260* :  Our strategy at the movement is that we want also to protect and to grant this
*20:15.260- 20:23.640* :  surrender season, people to ship their lands. We want people to be satisfied and more
*20:23.640- 20:32.240* :  over to make a business because we want food to be there. We can relate or UN and other to
*20:32.380- 20:40.260* :  release the people without protecting the land. Our land is a very fair time, with the security,
*20:40.260- 20:46.680* :  with the shifting of the people their land, it means that we are creating a food security.
*20:50.620- 20:56.200* :  In the late 1990s, almost every country in the world signed up to a UN agreement on climate change.
*20:56.860- 21:01.940* :  The Kyoto Protocol is now widely seen as the point at which politicians agreed to limit
*21:01.940- 21:07.760* :  greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly three decades on, a new play by the Royal Shakespeare Company
*21:07.760- 21:12.460* :  is telling the story of how the treaty was pushed through. This report from Vincent Dowd.
*21:13.180- 21:21.320* :  I refer you to sub-item 1B of the provisional agenda for the session contained in document FCCC.
*21:21.440- 21:28.340* :  In a dull grey building in 1997, dull grey diplomacy unfurls at a climate conference in Japan.
*21:28.340- 21:34.500* :  Twenty-seven years later, Kyoto, the play in rehearsal at the RSC in strapped upon Avan,
*21:34.500- 21:45.900* :  digs out the drama beneath. The authors believe how the argument on global warming has been
*21:45.900- 21:51.800* :  conducted reflects the modern attitude to almost any big controversial issue.
*21:52.400- 21:56.720* :  I'm Joe Robertson, one of the writers of Kyoto at the Royal Shakespeare Company.
*21:57.140- 22:02.980* :  And I'm Joe Murphy, the other writer. We're both very aware of the atmosphere in the world at the
*22:02.980- 22:07.800* :  moment of disagreement, of conflict. There's quite a few brawl, sense of things,
*22:07.820- 22:12.200* :  of feeling ever more entrenched in our own sort of isolated individual cells.
*22:12.200- 22:18.100* :  And we came across this story about Kyoto, about the protocol agreed in 1997, actually,
*22:18.100- 22:23.100* :  on BBC Radio, one of the reunion episodes. And it just seemed to us this utterly
*22:23.100- 22:29.860* :  incredible, dramatic, moving story. And 176 countries came together and agreed on something
*22:29.860- 22:34.960* :  that really they shouldn't have agreed on. We'll recommend the adoption of this protocol
*22:35.440- 22:38.040* :  to the conference by Yuna Nimiti.
*22:39.900- 22:45.880* :  Joe Robertson and Joe Murphy needed a central figure to hold together a story which could
*22:45.880- 22:51.200* :  have become a morass of technical detail. As we did more research, taught to dozens of people
*22:51.200- 22:55.540* :  who were there, read as many books on climate as we could get our hands on. We sort of discovered
*22:55.540- 22:59.580* :  a character who isn't a lot of those books, but is often in the footnotes. There's not much
*22:59.580- 23:04.020* :  online about him. And we did a deep dive into this man called Don Pullman, who was an American
*23:04.020- 23:09.520* :  oil lobbyist during that time. He's deceased now, but he played such a vital role in those
*23:09.520- 23:14.840* :  negotiations in preventing the progress of the negotiations. Don Pullman's played by American
*23:14.840- 23:16.280* :  actor Stephen Kunkan.
*23:17.680- 23:21.880* :  Now I know what people like you think of lawyers like me, but I'm the only one who can tell this
*23:21.920- 23:27.160* :  story because I'm the only one who was there. And if you want to know it all, you can't have it all
*23:27.160- 23:32.140* :  your own way. Don is really the narrator in the center, telling a story of agreement through
*23:32.140- 23:37.420* :  the one man who didn't want it to happen, presented to us an irresistible dramatic engine.
*23:37.640- 23:41.140* :  And the U.S. went up and made it up for other basis of a huge scare.
*23:42.660- 23:47.720* :  Opposition in the Senate meant the U.S. never ratified the agreement in Canada pulled out
*23:47.720- 23:54.760* :  in 2011. Do actors Radhrawi and Jürger Bosk think the script portrays anyone on stage as
*23:54.760- 24:00.340* :  all hero or all villain? No, I think what what it does very specifically, it says, listen,
*24:00.580- 24:05.360* :  you've got to put yourself in the other man's shoe in this very divided world, but somehow they
*24:05.360- 24:11.240* :  did reach an agreement, which was extraordinary. We'll all use technology, we'll travel, are you
*24:11.240- 24:16.540* :  willing to stop having a car, having a phone? How do you make two and a half hours work on stage,
*24:16.540- 24:23.420* :  on this very complex topic? A lot of energy, a lot of humor. If you were to have concerns where
*24:23.420- 24:29.040* :  it's China's target time level, where do you have four times more? The writers say their play
*24:29.040- 24:34.440* :  is really about how in a fractious world we can find ways to debate the big questions
*24:34.440- 24:40.620* :  if we try. You really could point your finger at any issue in the newspapers or all across the
*24:40.620- 24:46.640* :  media, such as gender identities, such as anything that we are discussing at the moment and finding
*24:46.640- 24:52.700* :  an appropriate and meaningful way to discuss, it is applicable to this. Actually, how do you tell a
*24:52.700- 24:57.020* :  hopeful story about climate change? How do you make people walk out of a theatre, having felt
*24:57.020- 25:01.520* :  something, having felt that change is possible, having actually been motivated by this incredible
*25:01.520- 25:05.560* :  story. So there is a huge element of hope there. Conference adjourned.
*25:08.140- 25:14.480* :  A report by Vincent Doubt. Now to an advert that probably won't be playing in the US today.
*25:15.820- 25:22.460* :  Your digital life matters. Protect it with the new Casperski. Like this guy, he gets it.
*25:24.620- 25:28.900* :  Well, he won't get it if he's in America because the government in Washington has banned the
*25:28.900- 25:34.020* :  Russian cyber security firm Casperski Lab from selling its popular anti-virus software.
*25:34.020- 25:40.740* :  It's also sanctioned 12 senior bosses from the firm. The US Commerce Secretary Gina Ramondo
*25:40.740- 25:45.980* :  said the Russian government was able to use firms like Casperski to steal information or plant
*25:45.980- 25:52.020* :  malware on American computers, something the company denies. Jen Ellis is a cyber security expert.
*25:52.020- 25:57.720* :  James Menendez asked her how unusual is this? I think it's fairly unprecedented if I'm honest.
*25:57.740- 26:03.740* :  You know, we've previously had a situation where they banned it from use in the government.
*26:04.600- 26:08.760* :  And we've seen that happen with other technology, right? We've seen it with Huawei and we've
*26:08.760- 26:16.580* :  seen it with TikTok. But to actually single out a single company, banned them from any commercial
*26:16.620- 26:26.160* :  sales, that seems unusual to me. And as consumers, we never really get to see the evidence,
*26:26.160- 26:33.860* :  the justification for the ban, do we? No. I have a belief that there is an evidentiary process,
*26:33.860- 26:38.380* :  that there is a requirement that they don't take these steps lightly. But as consumers,
*26:38.380- 26:42.520* :  no, we won't know what that looks like. It would be unlikely that they would share that information
*26:42.520- 26:47.460* :  publicly. If the government did want to hack another country's critical infrastructure,
*26:47.900- 26:53.580* :  and we've seen cases, for example, in the UK with hospitals just in the past couple of weeks.
*26:54.060- 26:58.980* :  I mean, presumably it can do so without hiding behind like a company such as Kaspersky,
*26:58.980- 27:05.640* :  right? I think here's the concern. There is a view that we are potentially seeing lines drawn
*27:05.640- 27:15.520* :  between Western nations, sort of Europe and NATO and five eyes nations. And then on the other
*27:15.520- 27:21.340* :  side of the line, sort of, you know, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. And that there will be
*27:21.340- 27:28.960* :  a strong cyber component to these lines being drawn and to any potential for future aggression
*27:28.960- 27:36.600* :  or combat, right? And I think the view is that what we don't want to see happen is for potential
*27:36.600- 27:41.260* :  what we call back doors being planted. And that basically means that you use something that you
*27:41.260- 27:46.160* :  think is innocent and that you have no reason to be suspicious of. But it is providing a foothold.
*27:46.160- 27:51.520* :  It's sort of imagine a sleeper cell, right? Like a sleeper spy. But it's a technological one
*27:51.520- 27:57.400* :  that you may not ever activate or you might activate it when you need it. And I think the concern
*27:57.400- 28:04.020* :  is that you could have that be really widespread in every sector of your economy and including
*28:04.020- 28:08.560* :  your critical infrastructure. And that could be catastrophic if it was then activated at some point
*28:08.560- 28:13.040* :  in the future. Which sort of suggests that it's about, but possibly when we don't know, of course,
*28:13.040- 28:17.180* :  future risk rather than something that's already happened. I just finally, I mean, what should,
*28:17.920- 28:22.300* :  you know, what should users do about this? So firstly, I would say for users in this country,
*28:22.300- 28:26.140* :  they should wait and see what the UK government will say. And whether the UK government will
*28:26.140- 28:31.700* :  will also support this or will not, right? They will be doing their own research and they will
*28:31.700- 28:36.160* :  be sharing information with the US government. So the first thing, the second thing is, you know,
*28:36.160- 28:40.940* :  if you do have Kasperskin, you are concerned, then there are other options available on the market.
*28:40.940- 28:44.920* :  It might be worth having a look at what those are and trying to understand what a replacement
*28:44.920- 28:51.620* :  would look like. And you also might want to go through your logs or your security data to see
*28:51.620- 28:56.580* :  where there is any indication of any activity that looks suspicious, right? Those are the kinds of
*28:56.580- 29:01.720* :  things you can do as an organization. As a consumer, I would just say, for consumers, don't worry
*29:01.720- 29:06.120* :  about it too much right now. Wait and see what government says. Cybersecurity expert Jen Ellis,
*29:06.980- 29:12.180* :  a watch that the late US President John F. Kennedy once lost at cards is to be auctioned at
*29:12.180- 29:16.660* :  Christie's in New York on Monday, with some reports saying it could sell for as much as two
*29:16.660- 29:22.340* :  million dollars. As Alison Davis reports, the timepiece has had a checkered history since it left
*29:22.340- 29:29.480* :  JFK's wrist in the early 1940s. The gold plated Swiss-made Buellova watch began its life as a
*29:29.480- 29:36.380* :  Christmas present to the 25-year-old JFK in 1942, with the date and his initials engraved on
*29:36.380- 29:42.600* :  the back. But its time with JFK was short-lived, leaving him when he reportedly lost a game of cards.
*29:42.700- 29:48.940* :  So started a life of changing risks, descending from the promising high with the future president
*29:48.960- 29:57.480* :  to, in 1998, a Boston pawn shop. It was bought by a German tourist for a reported $280,
*29:57.580- 30:04.220* :  who then sold it to the Austrian watch specialist Heinrich Hutner. He saw it had potential,
*30:04.220- 30:09.920* :  but couldn't prove that it had belonged to John F. Kennedy. Then, after years of research,
*30:09.920- 30:17.920* :  he got access to an archive of some 5,000 photos of the Kennedy family in the early 1940s. Mr.
*30:17.920- 30:26.480* :  Hutner poured through them one by one and finally one photo emerged. It shows a young JFK staring at
*30:26.480- 30:33.360* :  the camera with, on his wrist, the Buellova. The photo is Heinrich Hutner's key to potentially
*30:33.360- 30:41.860* :  $2 million, the starting price at the auction, $720,000. He is quoted as saying that, without it,
*30:41.860- 30:45.480* :  the watch was worth nothing. Now, it's worth a fortune.
*30:49.460- 30:54.000* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back at the same time tomorrow.
