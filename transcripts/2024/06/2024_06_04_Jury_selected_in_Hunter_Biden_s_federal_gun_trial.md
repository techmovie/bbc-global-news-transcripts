*01:27.140- 01:31.480* :  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Tuesday 4 June, these are our main stories.
*01:32.200- 01:38.200* :  The jury for the trial of President Biden's son Hunter has been sworn in. He denies several gun charges.
*01:39.080- 01:45.080* :  The Israeli army says four hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7th were killed months ago
*01:45.360- 01:47.800* :  during an Israeli operation in Han Unis.
*01:50.740- 01:54.720* :  Also in this podcast, the most subscribed YouTuber is...
*02:06.460- 02:08.480* :  Mr. Beast will tell you why.
*02:12.960- 02:18.940* :  It's a historic first for the U.S. The prosecution of a sitting president's son or daughter.
*02:19.520- 02:24.940* :  Hunter Biden has gone on trial on gun charges which he denies. It follows his purchase
*02:24.940- 02:29.880* :  of a handgun in 2018 when by his own admission he was addicted to drugs.
*02:30.660- 02:35.380* :  The jury has now been sworn in for the trial which comes just days after Donald Trump became
*02:35.380- 02:40.440* :  the first president, former or sitting, to be handed a criminal conviction.
*02:41.260- 02:46.100* :  Democrats fear that Republicans will try to use Hunter Biden's court case to shift attention
*02:46.100- 02:51.680* :  away from Mr. Trump and to attack President Biden as a race for the White House hots up.
*02:52.340- 02:57.100* :  I heard more from our correspondent Tom Bateman who spent the day at the court house in Wilmington
*02:57.100- 03:02.040* :  in Delaware. Well, what we've had is the opening of the trial Hunter Biden showed up and other
*03:02.040- 03:07.660* :  members of the Biden family including his stepmother, the first lady Jill Biden who's been
*03:07.660- 03:13.100* :  sitting in the courtroom just a meter or so behind him at the front of the public benches.
*03:13.420- 03:18.820* :  We have seen jury selection take place so the judge really screening ordinary men and women
*03:18.820- 03:23.960* :  who were called for potential jury service and among the questions they have been asked are
*03:23.960- 03:29.700* :  over a series of issues. Some of the questions have been around any political activism but also
*03:29.700- 03:37.000* :  their attitudes towards gun control and towards the issue of substance abuse and that is because
*03:37.000- 03:42.720* :  that the very heart of this case is the purchase by Hunter Biden here in Wilmington, Delaware in
*03:42.720- 03:51.100* :  2018 of a handgun, a 38 caliber revolver. Now that is not in dispute. What is in dispute is what he
*03:51.100- 03:57.280* :  meant when he ticked a box on a federal declaration form where he said that he was not addicted to
*03:57.280- 04:03.240* :  illegal drugs. The prosecution alleged that was a lie because they say that he was knowingly a drug
*04:03.240- 04:09.380* :  addict at the time. Now he has by his own admission talked about lengthy battle with drug and alcohol
*04:09.380- 04:15.080* :  addiction but it seems the defense are going to argue during the trial that when he ticked the box
*04:15.380- 04:19.500* :  his own understanding of what was meant by the wording didn't put him in that category that he
*04:19.500- 04:24.480* :  wasn't knowingly a drug addict at the moment he ticked the box. They will also argue it is thought
*04:24.620- 04:29.240* :  about some constitutional arguments about whether the law has been relaxed efficiently by the
*04:29.240- 04:36.680* :  Supreme Court since then that it can be argued that the gun ownership was then legal. He denies those
*04:36.680- 04:42.180* :  three felony counts. And Democrats are very concerned about what impact this could have on
*04:42.180- 04:46.540* :  President Biden's reelection chances. Yeah that's absolutely right and one of the reasons for that
*04:46.580- 04:53.520* :  is the Republicans have tried repeatedly to link a series of scandals and allegations surrounding
*04:53.520- 04:58.860* :  Hunter Biden the son of the president to the US president himself. Now that has been done
*04:58.860- 05:04.580* :  so far without compelling evidence having been offered an attempt by House of Representative
*05:04.580- 05:09.560* :  Republicans to try to move forward with an impeachment of President Biden. Some of that linked
*05:10.000- 05:15.320* :  to some of these Republican claims which is really so far not gathered a huge amount of
*05:15.680- 05:20.500* :  progress in the House itself. Tom Bateman in the US state of Delaware.
*05:21.480- 05:25.780* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested he is willing to accept
*05:25.780- 05:30.920* :  the first phase of a ceasefire plan for Gaza outlined by President Biden last week.
*05:30.920- 05:35.960* :  It starts with a six week break in the fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
*05:36.520- 05:42.540* :  But its end goal is a promised permanent end to the war. Something Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly
*05:42.540- 05:49.580* :  said he won't accept without the elimination of Hamas. Meanwhile the Israeli army has confirmed
*05:49.580- 05:54.580* :  the deaths of four more hostages in Gaza. It says they were killed month ago in the car
*05:54.580- 05:59.880* :  uniss area while an Israeli military operation was going on. Our Middle East correspondent,
*05:59.880- 06:05.620* :  Missy Williamson reports from southern Israel. This three step path to a permanent ceasefire was
*06:05.620- 06:11.360* :  apparently approved by Israel's Prime Minister but it's far from certain it will end this conflict
*06:11.360- 06:16.580* :  and it's launched a fresh battle for him at home. Benjamin Netanyahu's far right allies
*06:16.580- 06:22.600* :  have said he must continue the war until Hamas is destroyed or they'll bring down the government.
*06:23.440- 06:30.220* :  Hamas says it won't free more hostages without a guarantee the war will end. Today Mr Netanyahu
*06:30.220- 06:36.160* :  insisted that simply freeing hostages would not be enough for Hamas to buy an end to the war.
*06:37.740- 06:42.940* :  We have gone a long way to return the hostages while keeping the wars objectives in mind,
*06:42.940- 06:49.240* :  primarily the elimination of Hamas. We insist that we will achieve both. It's all part of the plan,
*06:49.260- 06:57.320* :  not something I've just added. Tonight Israel learned that four more captives were confirmed to have
*06:57.320- 07:06.140* :  died. Heim Perry, Yoram Metzka, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popolwell. After almost eight months of war,
*07:06.140- 07:12.880* :  much of northern Gaza lies in ruins but Israel's Prime Minister is struggling to end the war because
*07:12.880- 07:19.520* :  he hasn't achieved his war goals. He hasn't brought back all the hostages. He hasn't destroyed Hamas.
*07:19.660- 07:25.580* :  The U.S. President says Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out the kind of attack it did
*07:25.580- 07:31.960* :  on the 7th of October, but Israelis living here by the Gaza border say they still don't feel safe.
*07:32.760- 07:38.640* :  Mr Netanyahu says Israel's conditions for ending the war remain the same. The elimination of Hamas
*07:38.640- 07:44.740* :  as a military or governing force in Gaza. He's described any deal that didn't take that on board
*07:44.740- 07:50.700* :  as a non-starter. Ending this conflict rests with the leaders of Israel and Hamas,
*07:51.440- 07:57.600* :  locked in a war for their own survival. Lucy Williamson. As fierce fighting continues between
*07:57.600- 08:03.540* :  rival military units in Sudan, people in the city of El Fasha in North Darfur say there's been
*08:03.540- 08:09.820* :  sustained shelling. The fighting has intensified in the past month as a rapid support forces try to
*08:09.820- 08:16.100* :  seize control of the city from the Sudanese army. And so it reports. Doctors from the Saudi
*08:16.100- 08:20.940* :  Hospital say there were deaths and injuries after yet another night of bombardment in El Fasha.
*08:21.020- 08:26.640* :  Medical director Moddha Ibrahim says they've now ran out of fuel and surgical supplies.
*08:27.340- 08:31.140* :  He shared photographs showing medics using lamps as they attended to patients.
*08:32.100- 08:37.720* :  A spokesperson for refugees in Darfur, Adam Rojale, described their taxes collective punishment
*08:37.720- 08:43.580* :  for civilians. They are exhausted by hunger and are living under unspeakable horrific conditions,
*08:43.580- 08:51.120* :  he said. And so next to Mexico, supporters of Claudia Shainbaum have been celebrating her
*08:51.120- 08:56.980* :  election as the country's first female president. Mohamed Shainbaum, who's a climate scientist,
*08:56.980- 09:02.100* :  took about 60% of the vote. From Mexico City, Will Grant reports.
*09:02.840- 09:05.800* :  Once the electoral authority in Mexico confirmed her win,
*09:06.080- 09:10.480* :  Claudia Shainbaum addressed supporters in front of the National Palace, where she will take over
*09:10.480- 09:16.000* :  as Mexico's first female president later this year. Her victory, she told them, was shared with
*09:16.000- 09:21.040* :  generations of women who'd gone before her. In a nation where 11 women and girls are murdered
*09:21.040- 09:26.480* :  every day, the Shainbaum's victories considered a watershed moment, even by some of her critics.
*09:27.300- 09:32.780* :  Will Grant, the new Mexican president, said her priorities included welfare programs,
*09:32.780- 09:36.580* :  tackling the budget deficit and encouraging private investment.
*09:37.340- 09:42.340* :  President Biden was among the world leaders who congratulated her, but the markets reacted
*09:42.340- 09:48.600* :  unfavorably to her landslide victory. Mexico's currency, the pace, though, fell by more than 3%.
*09:49.380- 09:54.040* :  For more on the implications of this win for US-Mexico relations and also worldwide,
*09:54.720- 10:00.520* :  Krupa Party spoke to Jorge Guajado, a former Mexican ambassador to China, who's now a partner
*10:00.520- 10:06.480* :  at the Washington-based consultancy Denton's Global Advisors. So what's his reaction to the
*10:06.480- 10:10.740* :  outcome of this election? Surprisingly, to be honest, I did not expect this
*10:11.080- 10:16.700* :  big mandate. It's humongous. It's more than the current president got vote-wise,
*10:16.700- 10:22.080* :  which he already had a huge mandate. So I'm quite surprised about the outcome
*10:22.080- 10:26.520* :  of her party. Morena now controls both houses of Congress to eat a new Mexico.
*10:26.980- 10:31.120* :  I want to turn her attention to the subject of international relations, because we know that the
*10:31.120- 10:37.040* :  masses of drug trafficking and illegal migration, they loom large, especially when it comes to
*10:37.040- 10:43.440* :  Mexican and US relations. Yet we've also seen Mexico become one of America's biggest trading
*10:43.440- 10:49.960* :  partners ahead now of China. What can we expect from Claudia Shainbaum on this front?
*10:49.960- 10:54.720* :  That is a good question that I'm sure we're all trying to figure out. During the campaign,
*10:54.720- 11:00.620* :  she tagged as closely as possible to President Lopez Obrador. There was no daylight between them.
*11:00.680- 11:04.220* :  So my initial thought would be you can expect the same that we've been seeing,
*11:04.220- 11:09.760* :  pragmatic, transactional approach to US-Mexico relations. However, that campaign is over the
*11:09.760- 11:15.760* :  votes are in. She won with a huge mandate. It is now her turn to cover and my guess is as
*11:15.780- 11:21.520* :  much as she was tacked close to the current president. She will now seek her own style. In that case,
*11:21.520- 11:29.940* :  if her period governing Mexico City is any indication, is a more science-based approach to issue,
*11:29.940- 11:35.420* :  a more technocratic-based approach. She was quite successful fighting organized crime during her
*11:36.300- 11:41.680* :  term as governor of Mexico City. So in terms of organized crime, my guess is she will be more
*11:41.680- 11:47.820* :  technocratic-based as opposed to ideological as a current president. This migration, I don't
*11:47.820- 11:54.240* :  think, changes. I think every president, regardless of party color or ideology, will seek to cooperate
*11:54.240- 12:00.000* :  with the United States in this area. We share a border. It's a border that has benefited Mexico
*12:00.000- 12:06.660* :  economically, developmentally. Nobody wants to put it at risk. Right now, the issue bringing
*12:06.660- 12:11.600* :  both countries to the table is migration. And whoever wants, in this case, Claudia,
*12:12.280- 12:16.920* :  the same bomb. I'm sure we'll be seeking for a way to cooperate with the United States to make
*12:16.920- 12:23.280* :  sure it does not become a big problem. Okay, Guajado, Mexico's former ambassador to China.
*12:24.420- 12:29.820* :  The BBC has seen new evidence that suggests the woman who became known as a missing crypto queen
*12:29.820- 12:36.700* :  may have been murdered. Roger Ignativer has long been on the FBI's 10 most wanted list after
*12:36.700- 12:43.200* :  persuading millions of people to invest in the bogus one coin scheme. An investigation by the BBC
*12:43.200- 12:50.160* :  ITM, along with a panorama TV program, suggests her close links to the Bulgarian mafia may have led
*12:50.160- 13:01.500* :  to her downfall. Robburn reports. One, two, three, applause please. It's really a pleasure for me
*13:01.500- 13:08.200* :  to be here. One and a half years after we launched our cryptocurrency one point and we already
*13:08.200- 13:14.100* :  wrote history. For five years, a BBC podcast has been investigating the disappearance of the so-called
*13:14.100- 13:20.600* :  crypto queen. Bulgarian fraudster Roger Ignativer stole billions via her enormous worldwide scam,
*13:20.620- 13:26.740* :  peddling a fake cryptocurrency called one coin. This coin is going to be number one worldwide.
*13:26.940- 13:36.620* :  We will be the biggest out there. In 2017, she went missing. Since then, victims, law enforcement
*13:36.620- 13:41.980* :  and journalists have been trying to unpick clues about her possible whereabouts. Now the BBC has
*13:41.980- 13:47.200* :  some new evidence. We've obtained secret Europe poll documents suggesting Roger Ignativer had
*13:47.200- 13:53.580* :  links to an alleged crime boss. Christopherus, a manateedist known as Taki, is widely suspected of
*13:53.580- 13:58.160* :  leading a Bulgarian-organized crime group. The document suggests he offered her protection
*13:58.160- 14:04.960* :  and in return, Roger laundered his money. I think Taki is very dangerous man. I try to be
*14:05.260- 14:13.940* :  not afraid, but in fact, I have a reason to be afraid. Bulgarian journalist Dimitar Stoyanov has been
*14:13.940- 14:18.700* :  working with eye investigations and panorama on this story. He's been looking into Roger's
*14:18.700- 14:23.420* :  relationship with the Bulgarian underworld for years. One of his gangland sources, a criminal
*14:23.420- 14:28.660* :  associate of Taki's known as Kuro, told him he had information about Roger's disappearance.
*14:36.220- 14:45.680* :  Kuro asked Taki, why did you talk in front of Roger? Taki answered, don't worry. She is as good
*14:45.680- 14:54.460* :  as that. She disappeared three or four days later. Kuro had obtained a secret police report which
*14:54.460- 15:00.520* :  he shared with Dimitar. It alleged that Taki's brother-in-law, who was drunk at the time, had been
*15:00.520- 15:06.020* :  over her discussing Ruzia. He said she'd been killed on a yacht off Greece, and her dismembered
*15:06.020- 15:14.060* :  body had been thrown in the sea. The key question is why would Taki kill her? A one possible answer
*15:14.060- 15:20.400* :  is that she already knew too much. This is even Kristinov, a former deputy minister in the Bulgarian
*15:20.400- 15:26.120* :  government. He investigated allegations Taki ran a significant criminal network with help from
*15:26.120- 15:33.000* :  corrupt officials. If, in the mafia, you become a liability, you're a butchered and you're
*15:33.000- 15:39.380* :  thrown to sink at the bottom of the sea. European documents and property records reveal a series
*15:39.380- 15:44.320* :  of financial deals between Ruzia and members of Taki's family. And other property records,
*15:44.320- 15:49.540* :  and eyewitness accounts also suggest Taki's associates are now living in her Bulgarian mansions.
*15:50.360- 15:55.360* :  Richard Reinhardt, a former special agent with the US Internal Revenue Service, worked on Ruzia's
*15:55.360- 16:00.240* :  case. He said the allegations of her murder were credible, although there was no proof.
*16:11.720- 16:16.740* :  Taki has not been arrested over claims he had the crypto-queen murdered. Bulgarian police say
*16:16.740- 16:21.440* :  they don't have enough evidence. They have previously investigated him for murder, armed robbery,
*16:21.440- 16:27.080* :  and drug trafficking, but there have been no prosecutions. The BBC wrote to Taki's lawyers,
*16:27.080- 16:33.180* :  they didn't respond. The Bulgarian government also didn't respond. The prosecutor's office in
*16:33.180- 16:37.720* :  Sophia says it doesn't cover up crimes and persons who have possibly committed crimes.
*16:37.740- 16:43.160* :  Ruzia Ignatova's body has never been found. There have been reported sightings of her since
*16:43.160- 16:48.620* :  she's alleged to have been murdered, but nothing has ever come of them. Only her arrest or proof of
*16:48.620- 16:52.980* :  her death will solve the enduring mystery of the missing crypto-queen.
*17:11.520- 17:16.560* :  Still to come? That's what we're here for. That's why we want to prevent the spread of rabies
*17:16.560- 17:22.120* :  a deadly disease. If we don't sterilize now with only animals left, they'll eat each other,
*17:22.160- 17:28.600* :  they'll attack people. We hear how a woman in Ukraine is trying to rescue thousands of dogs affected
*17:38.380- 17:42.580* :  by the conflict. This podcast is brought to you by eHarmony. The dating app to find someone,

*18:43.140- 18:48.400* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast. He played a key role in Britain departure from
*18:48.400- 18:53.620* :  the European Union, even though he has never won elected office in the UK only in the European
*18:53.620- 18:59.120* :  Parliament. Nigel Farage often pictured with a pint of beer in his hand helped to sell Brexit
*18:59.120- 19:04.100* :  to many working class voters who felt ignored by the mainstream political parties.
*19:05.000- 19:09.100* :  Now after saying last week that he wouldn't be standing as a candidate in next month's general
*19:09.100- 19:15.320* :  election, he's announced that he's changed his mind and he will lead the right wing reform party
*19:15.320- 19:20.240* :  which was formally known as the Brexit Party. I can't let down those millions of people.
*19:20.740- 19:26.760* :  I simply can't do it. It'll be wrong. So I have decided I've changed my mind. It's allowed
*19:26.760- 19:33.220* :  you know it's not always a side of weakness. It could potentially be a sign of strength.
*19:33.340- 19:40.020* :  So I am going to stand in this election. I asked our political correspondent Rob Watson
*19:40.020- 19:44.900* :  how significant this development was. I think you could argue that it's the most important
*19:44.900- 19:49.500* :  thing to have happened since the election campaign began how long ago by almost two weeks,
*19:49.840- 19:55.760* :  Rishi Sunak standing in the rain. Why is it so significant? Because what his entry into the race
*19:55.760- 20:00.380* :  does is to make life even more difficult for the governing Conservative Party, Mr Sunak,
*20:00.380- 20:06.120* :  because the danger he poses that it's going to split the vote on the right. So people are populist,
*20:06.120- 20:11.900* :  people are worried about immigration, people who like the kind of cut of Mr Faraj's jibbers it were,
*20:12.320- 20:15.400* :  they will be tempted to desert the tourists and conservatives for him.
*20:15.740- 20:19.580* :  But just last week he was saying he wasn't going to stand in the election and he was going to focus
*20:19.580- 20:25.140* :  on helping Donald Trump win the White House. Why do you turn? Well I reckon he probably thinks
*20:25.580- 20:30.820* :  he can do both. Having spent more time with Nigel Faraj in the last eight years that I have
*20:30.820- 20:36.740* :  with some members of my own family, I suspect that he couldn't resist the challenge. I mean I think
*20:36.740- 20:44.040* :  he sees that there's a very strong anti-politics mood out there and anti-system mood and anti-establishment
*20:44.040- 20:50.100* :  parties. And Mr Faraj I think would unashamedly say that he enjoys that the limelight. And as you
*20:50.100- 20:55.120* :  said he is the most arguably one of the most consequential politicians in recent decades. I mean
*20:55.120- 21:00.040* :  Brexit would not have happened without Nigel Faraj. So that's how important he is. And so when he
*21:00.320- 21:06.160* :  when he talks about as he did today promising a political revolt, you can see why people might
*21:06.160- 21:11.720* :  want to take it seriously. And the opposition Labour Party are already bored up by the fact that
*21:11.720- 21:16.700* :  opinion polls suggest they are way way ahead of the conservatives. Yes and they'll be I mean
*21:16.700- 21:22.640* :  quietly celebrating because Nigel Faraj is entering its Rishi Sunak's absolute worst nightmare.
*21:23.540- 21:29.040* :  Rob Watson. French investigators are looking into whether Russia was behind a stunt in which five
*21:29.040- 21:34.920* :  coffins wrapped in French flags with the words French soldiers from Ukraine were left at the foot
*21:34.920- 21:40.620* :  of the Islet Tower. Three men have been arrested, a Bulgarian, a German and Ukrainian, who it
*21:40.660- 21:46.380* :  thought were paid to plant the coffins in what prosecutors are saying was an act of psychological
*21:46.440- 21:52.380* :  violence. Reports say that the men had links to a group that sprayed red hands on a Holocaust
*21:52.380- 21:58.000* :  memorial in Paris last month. President Macron recently angered Moscow by saying he would not
*21:58.000- 22:02.800* :  rule out sending French troops to Ukraine. A Paris correspondent is Hugh Scofield.
*22:03.360- 22:09.100* :  It was on Saturday morning about 9 o'clock in the morning and a van drew up and three men in
*22:09.100- 22:15.420* :  the van got out these coffins and laid them out just beside the Islet Tower draped with a
*22:15.420- 22:23.000* :  French flag and with his sign saying the French dead of Ukraine. They chose the area presumably
*22:23.000- 22:28.400* :  because of the kind of shock value, but it is also an area heavily policed and they were
*22:28.400- 22:34.500* :  immediately apprehended. At least one of them was, two others got away and the man said that he'd
*22:34.500- 22:39.340* :  been paid simply to bring the van to the Islet Tower by the other two. The other two got away
*22:39.340- 22:45.200* :  with then subsequently caught trying to get a bus or a coach to Berlin and they said they'd been
*22:45.200- 22:52.260* :  paid 400 euros or so to do the job. They're all in detention now. They're all likely to be placed
*22:52.260- 22:59.100* :  under investigation and everyone is asking the question who ordered this and does it again
*22:59.100- 23:04.820* :  suggest kind of underhand operation by the Russians? That's certainly the sort of notion that's on
*23:04.820- 23:10.340* :  on everyone's lips. Because there is a report in the Mond newspapers saying that they think there
*23:10.340- 23:18.680* :  is a link between this incident with the coffins and an incident last month when red hands were
*23:18.680- 23:24.360* :  sprayed on a Holocaust memorial in Paris. Exactly and I mean that's an intriguing clue. This is the
*23:24.360- 23:28.880* :  third event in the last few months which bears the hallmarks of some kind of destabilization
*23:28.880- 23:33.740* :  manipulation of opinion kind of operation. Quite possibly going to the government run by the
*23:33.740- 23:39.040* :  Russians. The previous two were when stars of David Words have dorked stenciled on walls across
*23:39.040- 23:44.780* :  Paris just after the Hamas attacks in October. The second one was about a month ago when these red
*23:44.780- 23:50.740* :  hands were painted dorked in a similar fashion over a Holocaust memorial as you're saying in Paris.
*23:51.380- 23:56.640* :  There were people identified who carried that out but who got away on again on a coach out of
*23:56.640- 24:01.560* :  France. One of the people who the police think carried out that painting that door being of red
*24:01.560- 24:07.240* :  hands at the memorial was in contact with told by Le Monde who've seen investigation the dossier
*24:07.680- 24:15.520* :  was in contact with one of the men who carried out the coffins affair on Saturday. We suggest that
*24:15.520- 24:21.320* :  there is some kind of coordination and of course you know everyone looks to Russia because you know
*24:21.320- 24:26.140* :  it is called the government you know very much part of their motives operand I did the Russian
*24:26.140- 24:31.240* :  intelligence services at an arms length you know employing people who we employ people who we
*24:31.240- 24:36.280* :  employ people carry out this kind of destabilization of opinion operation.
*24:37.180- 24:41.500* :  You scoffield and staying with the subject of Ukraine there's a new film out about the conflict
*24:41.500- 24:48.660* :  bear but you won't get an idea of its unusual angle if I just tell you the title war tales but maybe
*24:48.660- 24:56.880* :  you will if I spell out the title tales as in T-A-I-L-S. This is a documentary about a young woman
*24:56.880- 25:02.900* :  Cristina Dragomaretska who's part of a small team trying to rescue thousands of dogs and other
*25:02.900- 25:08.780* :  domestic animals whose lives have been turned upside down by war. It's not just about the huge
*25:08.780- 25:13.600* :  and growing number of strays but also about the danger of rabies spreading.
*25:20.820- 25:25.540* :  That's what we're here for that's why we want to prevent the spread of rabies a deadly
*25:25.540- 25:31.780* :  disease if we don't sterilize now especially in these abandoned places with only animals left
*25:31.780- 25:35.060* :  they'll eat each other they'll attack people they'll form packs.
*25:41.400- 25:47.240* :  Tim Franks spoke to Cristina while she was on a show visit to the UK since Russian invasion
*25:47.340- 25:54.360* :  we had a lot of homeless animals because million people lived them or they were dead because of
*25:54.360- 26:00.580* :  Russian rockets we had it before actually this problem with trade-offs but it not so big problem
*26:01.140- 26:07.780* :  when our army decupated territory around Kiev we took supplies from Europe different food
*26:08.820- 26:15.340* :  and the medicine we took all this stuff and went to decupated region around Kiev and we started
*26:15.340- 26:20.900* :  to fear animals but we have seen that it's not enough just feed them need to sterilize them
*26:20.900- 26:26.340* :  vaccinate them and then we can find our families. A lot of organization helps people
*26:27.180- 26:31.820* :  and not so much organization helps animals but they also suffering.
*26:32.600- 26:37.900* :  Tell me how you came to start doing this because you're am I right in saying that you're trained
*26:37.900- 26:43.980* :  as an architect? Yeah before the war I worked in the Nikita two years I did volunteering I took
*26:44.020- 26:50.080* :  stray dogs to my balcony usually it was families of stray puppies I looked to need them the
*26:50.080- 26:55.500* :  warm them to sterilize them and find a family for them when work come no one need architect
*26:56.120- 27:01.020* :  now I should save animals because the place where we go in and our team it's from plan
*27:01.840- 27:08.240* :  and you can die because we work sometimes two hundred meters from Russian so a lot of
*27:08.240- 27:13.720* :  spies there a lot of explosions around you so you can die a few minutes so and and Christine
*27:13.720- 27:18.060* :  on that I hope you don't mind me saying but just as you were walking to the studio I noticed that
*27:18.060- 27:24.560* :  you've got a bit of a limp. Yes I was injured in both chunks where we create animals a lot of
*27:24.560- 27:29.620* :  drone kamikaze around you and kamikaze drones so these are from the Russians. From the Russians
*27:29.620- 27:35.640* :  here and if they will see your car they immediately will destroy it so we decided to do it at night
*27:35.640- 27:41.560* :  at 12 because at night they will not send you drone kamikaze because night drone kamikaze
*27:41.560- 27:48.260* :  is very expensive so they will not manage just for people we save animals from some addresses and
*27:48.260- 27:53.940* :  it was the last address we went to run at the part of a church we found this animals where we took
*27:55.000- 28:02.300* :  them it was silent completely silent no drones no no rockets it was like 15 minutes of silence it was
*28:02.300- 28:10.700* :  very weird and we are going back to our car and we hear that some missiles coming and I felt
*28:10.700- 28:20.680* :  that it's coming to us I covered by myself a dog which I saved he was around 10 kilos I covered
*28:20.700- 28:27.340* :  him and when we left all this situation when we already were saved this dog looked at me like
*28:27.360- 28:33.780* :  like on a guard I was injured by fragments everything is okay actually fragment didn't hit
*28:33.820- 28:42.100* :  bone or nose so we just meet I'm likely I'm lucky that's one definition of luck I mean you're
*28:42.100- 28:47.160* :  you're obviously incredibly compassionate about dogs and other animals but are you concerned
*28:47.160- 28:53.740* :  that actually this could become a bit of a public health issue if there are lots of
*28:54.340- 29:01.000* :  federal dogs and you know rabies is endemic on the European mainland and you're worried about
*29:01.000- 29:07.240* :  the spread of the disease is is that part of the story yes because of Russian invasion we have
*29:07.260- 29:15.540* :  1 million stray dogs and they are unstrollized they are unvaccinated the multiply and the main
*29:15.540- 29:20.420* :  goal is of course sterilization and vaccination from disease because this disease rabies
*29:20.420- 29:27.520* :  doesn't have borders dogs can just pass through the forest and in fact foxes cats and rabies can
*29:27.520- 29:34.220* :  spread into the Europe so then our goal is to find someone like European Union animal welfare
*29:34.900- 29:42.880* :  who can help us to resource Ukrainian veterinarian and volunteer vaccinate and sterilize dogs and cats
*29:43.740- 29:50.720* :  that was Christina Drago Mariska now how many followers do you have on social media dozens
