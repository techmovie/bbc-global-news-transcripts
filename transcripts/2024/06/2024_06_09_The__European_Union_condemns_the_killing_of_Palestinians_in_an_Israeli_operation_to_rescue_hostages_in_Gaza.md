*01:26.220- 01:30.600* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Sunday the 9th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:31.220- 01:35.880* :  The European Union's high representative has strongly condemned the killing of Palestinians
*01:35.880- 01:37.260* :  in Gaza on Saturday.
*01:37.860- 01:41.520* :  It happened during Israel's military operation to free four hostages.
*01:42.120- 01:46.860* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the rescue had proved that Israel did not
*01:46.860- 01:48.280* :  surrender to terrorism.
*01:49.060- 01:53.700* :  And the French President Emmanuel Macron and his US counterpart Joe Biden have stressed
*01:53.700- 01:57.080* :  the enduring strength of the alliance between the two countries.
*01:59.760- 02:03.840* :  Also in this podcast, the best time of my entire life.
*02:03.920- 02:07.680* :  I'm 100 years old and my brother's 96.
*02:08.240- 02:11.500* :  The D. Day veteran who returned to Normandy and got married.
*02:16.440- 02:21.240* :  The European Union has condemned in the strongest terms the killing of Palestinians during
*02:21.240- 02:23.860* :  an Israeli military operation in Gaza on Saturday.
*02:24.380- 02:29.660* :  Hostages held by Hamas were rescued from a refugee camp, but during the process there
*02:29.660- 02:34.200* :  was what the EU's high representative, Joseph Barrel, called a massacre of civilians.
*02:34.860- 02:40.200* :  The operation involved airstrikes and intense gun battles with Hamas in and around the Nusserat
*02:40.200- 02:41.120* :  refugee camp.
*02:41.520- 02:46.280* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu focused on the Israelis who'd been freed.
*02:46.640- 02:53.060* :  Israel have just carried out a remarkable rescue operation, a four hostages held by Hamas.
*02:53.700- 02:59.120* :  This operation required ingenuity and courage of the highest degree and our soldiers performed
*03:00.060- 03:01.100* :  in an unmatchable way.
*03:01.500- 03:05.600* :  We're committed to getting the release of all the hostages and we expect Hamas to release
*03:05.600- 03:06.060* :  them all.
*03:06.660- 03:10.620* :  But if they don't do whatever it takes, we get them all back all.
*03:11.000- 03:15.420* :  Hamas is committing war crimes every day, including the old and the new hostages.
*03:15.740- 03:21.320* :  Our soldiers are performing in the most battled and moral way to end this war with the victory
*03:21.320- 03:26.020* :  and as these killers and against these kidnappers and we shall prevail.
*03:26.480- 03:31.540* :  Mr. Netanyahu made families of the rescued hostages, including the mother of 21-year-old
*03:31.540- 03:32.660* :  Al-Mogme-Azhan.
*03:33.440- 03:33.920* :  Thank you.
*03:35.740- 03:47.060* :  For bringing my son to me, to us, I'm so excited they could hug him today.
*03:48.040- 03:52.280* :  Israeli campaigners have been holding regular protests demanding their government do more
*03:52.280- 03:57.460* :  to get the hostages released and on Saturday thousands were out again on the streets of Tel
*03:57.460- 04:02.920* :  Aviv and there is as usual dispute over the number of Palestinians killed in this latest
*04:02.920- 04:07.400* :  Israeli operation, a single hospital says it counted 70 bodies.
*04:07.400- 04:13.420* :  Hamas claims more than 200 Palestinians were killed and 400 wounded with women and children
*04:13.420- 04:14.060* :  among them.
*04:14.460- 04:17.280* :  This man was searching for casualties among the rubble.
*04:18.920- 04:22.700* :  Israeli's allowed women and children to enter the house, then they hit it.
*04:22.920- 04:25.540* :  You know, we don't know which body belongs to who.
*04:25.940- 04:26.600* :  They're in pieces.
*04:27.020- 04:28.200* :  Nobody is in one piece.
*04:28.580- 04:32.700* :  We'll be getting more Arab reaction in a moment, but with details of the operation still
*04:32.700- 04:37.680* :  emerging, I asked our correspondent did Jerusalem, John Donerson, what we know so far.
*04:38.280- 04:43.140* :  We don't know the details of the number of people killed, but we certainly saw some
*04:43.140- 04:47.560* :  pretty grim images coming out of the hospitals in central Gaza and it's clear that the Israelis
*04:47.560- 04:52.280* :  used a lot of force to achieve what they say was a very successful operation.
*04:52.720- 04:57.520* :  So it does seem that whatever the number of Palestinians who killed was that they did
*04:57.800- 05:01.500* :  die during the course of the operation to free those hostages.
*05:01.860- 05:03.960* :  That certainly seems to be the case.
*05:04.620- 05:11.880* :  The raid happened on two apartments fairly close together in Nussarat, which is a very
*05:11.880- 05:17.920* :  densely populated camp in the center of Gaza, but in the run-up to it there was pretty
*05:17.920- 05:25.420* :  heavy bombardment by tanks and also air strikes and it's not clear how the Palestinians
*05:25.980- 05:30.780* :  were killed, whether they were immediately in the vicinity of the raid or in the build-up
*05:30.820- 05:31.180* :  to it.
*05:31.560- 05:36.920* :  Now the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under serious pressure to get hostages
*05:36.920- 05:37.420* :  released.
*05:38.380- 05:43.520* :  Do you think this rescue buys him time, does it take the pressure off, or is he still
*05:43.520- 05:46.720* :  under pressure because so many hostages remain in captivity?
*05:47.340- 05:50.120* :  I think it eases the pressure for the moment.
*05:50.260- 05:55.120* :  It will allow Benjamin Netanyahu to say, look, his strategy is working.
*05:55.120- 06:02.560* :  He believes that the best way to get the hostages out of Gaza and they remain 116 being held
*06:02.560- 06:08.820* :  there who are taken on October 7th, 40 of whom are thought to be dead, he thinks the
*06:08.820- 06:15.620* :  best way is to put pressure on Hamas militarily and this operation will allow him to say that
*06:15.700- 06:16.880* :  that is working.
*06:17.140- 06:20.320* :  The Israeli military, when we spoke to them today, they gave a briefing.
*06:20.800- 06:26.620* :  They said that a deal remain the best way to get a large number of hostages out but
*06:26.620- 06:32.120* :  there is no sign of that deal, a ceasefire deal with Hamas, there is no sign of that being
*06:32.120- 06:32.600* :  in the office.
*06:32.900- 06:39.700* :  The war cabinet minister Benny Gantz had given Saturday as the deadline for Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:39.700- 06:44.240* :  to come up with a plan for Gaza long term if that didn't emerge he said he was going
*06:44.240- 06:44.780* :  to resign.
*06:45.500- 06:46.780* :  What's happened with that?
*06:47.220- 06:52.520* :  That press conference by Benny Gantz was scheduled for late Saturday evening and it was
*06:52.520- 06:54.500* :  called off at fairly short notice.
*06:54.920- 07:01.200* :  We have had Benjamin Netanyahu tweeting this evening that this is the time for unity
*07:01.200- 07:02.440* :  and not for division.
*07:02.440- 07:08.780* :  I call on Benny Gantz, don't leave the emergency government, don't give up on unity and then
*07:08.780- 07:12.280* :  just moments later a response from Mr Gantz.
*07:12.280- 07:17.340* :  He said alongside the justified join the achievement, we must remember that all the challenges
*07:17.340- 07:23.600* :  Israel faces have remained as they were and therefore he said to Mr Netanyahu and the
*07:23.600- 07:29.940* :  leadership that we must consider responsibly how it is best and possible to continue from
*07:29.960- 07:30.260* :  here.
*07:30.460- 07:36.680* :  So I think he's leaving the door open there to carry through on his threat to resign although
*07:36.680- 07:38.860* :  he hasn't specifically said that at this point.
*07:38.860- 07:44.400* :  John Donerson, so political manoeuvring in Israel, meanwhile in Gaza the aftermath of the
*07:44.400- 07:48.900* :  Israeli air strikes, survivors like this woman struggling to understand what had happened.
*07:52.020- 07:55.600* :  We don't know what happened, we were sitting peacefully and all of a sudden we heard the
*07:55.600- 08:01.360* :  strikes, we were 50 people hiding there and saw missiles flying over our heads, nobody
*08:01.360- 08:05.060* :  is protecting us, the Red Cross doesn't protect us, nobody does.
*08:05.580- 08:10.600* :  We don't know where our children, we lost our children and spouses and here we are getting
*08:10.600- 08:13.540* :  displaced for the third time, not knowing where to go.
*08:15.900- 08:20.480* :  Hamas claims that during the course of the rescue operation, Israel also killed some of
*08:20.480- 08:25.740* :  the other hostages, still Israel defended its action, military spokesman Peter Lorna
*08:25.740- 08:28.620* :  insisting it was Hamas who were to blame for what had happened.
*08:29.340- 08:34.900* :  Every civilian life lost in this war is a deep tragedy, it's a tragedy nevertheless
*08:34.900- 08:40.660* :  that Hamas are responsible because they initiated this war on the October 7 attack and they
*08:40.660- 08:45.480* :  intentionally position all of their assets, including our hostages, within the civilian
*08:46.180- 08:46.200* :  population.
*08:46.700- 08:50.600* :  The Hamas' run health ministry has updated its overall death toll in Gaza.
*08:51.140- 08:55.720* :  It says that more than 36,000 people have been killed since the October attacks.
*08:56.180- 09:00.080* :  A Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson, has been monitoring what they've said about
*09:00.080- 09:03.160* :  dealing with the casualties from the Israeli strikes on Saturday.
*09:03.740- 09:08.720* :  They're saying that there's a great shortage of medicines, including anaesthetics and that
*09:08.720- 09:13.760* :  sort of thing and medical staff, and it's just the sheer weight of people, the weight
*09:13.760- 09:14.360* :  of numbers.
*09:15.120- 09:21.540* :  And of course, this is the case across Gaza, where there are not many now medical facilities
*09:21.540- 09:24.400* :  available to the many, many people who need them.
*09:25.040- 09:29.160* :  I'm told that President Mahmoud Abbas has called it this, a bloody massacre, and he wants
*09:29.160- 09:34.660* :  an urgent UN meeting to discuss what happened any time whether that's going to happen or
*09:35.340- 09:35.460* :  not.
*09:35.460- 09:40.880* :  Yes, he wants the Security Council to hold a special session to look into this.
*09:41.280- 09:45.420* :  If this is granted, this would come off the back of the International Court of Justice,
*09:45.420- 09:51.520* :  the ICJs, the decision earlier this year in which it ordered a cease-fire to take place
*09:51.520- 09:51.920* :  in Gaza.
*09:52.060- 09:54.860* :  Now, of course, as we see, sadly, that hasn't happened.
*09:55.660- 10:01.580* :  So you do wonder that even if the Security Council has this meeting, what would it actually
*10:01.580- 10:02.820* :  be able to result in?
*10:03.160- 10:07.300* :  And what about the Israel's neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, what about Saudi Arabia, your
*10:07.300- 10:09.380* :  other allies of the Palestinian cause?
*10:09.900- 10:10.580* :  What have they said?
*10:10.920- 10:17.060* :  Well, they've been saying for some time now that Israel's reaction to Hamas and Gaza
*10:17.060- 10:18.660* :  is disproportionate.
*10:19.160- 10:23.520* :  They've been saying that when you look at the number of people killed, in the case of
*10:23.520- 10:28.020* :  rescuing hostages, as we saw today, they're saying it's a very small number, and so many
*10:28.020- 10:29.340* :  civilians are dying.
*10:29.340- 10:33.020* :  Of course, we heard the Israeli response to that earlier where they say, well, if Hamas
*10:33.020- 10:37.940* :  insists on housing hostages in areas of high civility and density, then that's going
*10:37.940- 10:38.360* :  to happen.
*10:38.800- 10:43.940* :  But overall, what they want is a permanent cease-fire, and of course, for that to happen
*10:43.940- 10:47.640* :  with the peace talks to succeed, and at the moment, they're completely deadlocked.
*10:48.040- 10:48.640* :  Mike Thompson.
*10:49.460- 10:54.280* :  Now, to other news, the US and France have certainly had their ups and downs over the years.
*10:54.280- 10:59.760* :  They share a mutual revolutionary fervor back in the 18th century, France later gifting
*10:59.760- 11:01.300* :  America the Statue of Liberty.
*11:02.020- 11:06.600* :  Fast forward a couple of centuries, though, and the two fell out over Iraq, and over an
*11:06.600- 11:07.920* :  aborted submarine deal.
*11:07.920- 11:11.160* :  But the war in Ukraine seems to have refocused minds.
*11:11.160- 11:15.640* :  Joe Biden has been in France for celebrations to mark the anniversary of the World War
*11:15.640- 11:21.220* :  II Operation D-Day, and Saturday saw him being warmly welcomed in Paris by the President
*11:21.220- 11:22.200* :  Emmanuel Macron.
*11:23.020- 11:29.460* :  It is this, the Lordline, that is the connection between our two facts and two nations.
*11:29.460- 11:31.400* :  So once again, thank you for your presence.
*11:31.400- 11:40.480* :  Together with the President, we discuss the great issues that we are facing, the first
*11:40.480- 11:46.820* :  which being Ukraine, today in Ukraine, men and women are fighting with a remarkable
*11:46.820- 11:47.320* :  courage.
*11:48.160- 11:50.280* :  So what's going on beneath the warm words?
*11:50.280- 11:52.960* :  Is this just the usual diplomatic bon army?
*11:53.460- 11:57.060* :  Or are Washington and Paris really best buddies, once again, from Paris?
*11:57.440- 11:58.380* :  Huskowfield reports.
*12:03.280- 12:07.740* :  Before an audience of dignitaries and under a cloudless blue sky, President Macron welcomed
*12:07.740- 12:09.940* :  his American counterpart at the Arc de Trioff.
*12:10.400- 12:14.520* :  Together they later rekindled the flame over the tomb of the unknown soldier.
*12:14.880- 12:18.680* :  They were then driven down the Shons Elise, accompanied by cavalry of the Republican
*12:18.680- 12:21.620* :  Guard to the Elise Palace for a working lunch.
*12:21.960- 12:25.880* :  This afternoon, the two leaders appeared together before the news media, with President
*12:25.880- 12:29.040* :  Biden stressing once again the theme of this D-Day week.
*12:29.340- 12:34.700* :  The need to stand up to Russia today, just as the Allies stood up to Germany 80 years
*12:34.700- 12:35.000* :  ago.
*12:35.340- 12:40.680* :  This week we have showed the world once again the power of allies, where we can achieve
*12:40.680- 12:41.780* :  when we stand together.
*12:42.720- 12:46.300* :  This relationship between France and the United States exemplifies.
*12:46.740- 12:50.880* :  You know, we see it in the Ukraine, where our two countries are standing with the Ukrainian
*12:50.880- 12:54.180* :  people, as they fight off brutal aggression.
*12:54.560- 12:57.120* :  This evening there's been a state dinner at the Elise.
*12:57.660- 12:58.420* :  Huskowfield.
*12:59.380- 13:02.940* :  A major battle in Somalia has seen both sides claiming victory.
*13:02.940- 13:08.220* :  Fighters from the Islamist extremist group Al Shabab carried out a dawn attack on bases
*13:08.220- 13:12.020* :  held by government troops and allied militia in the town of El-Dir.
*13:12.480- 13:14.680* :  Al Shabab said the operation had succeeded.
*13:14.820- 13:18.360* :  The Somali government insisted the attack had been repelled.
*13:18.520- 13:19.500* :  Here's Will Ross.
*13:20.020- 13:24.120* :  The Somali government says the army was aware of an imminent attack and withdrew troops.
*13:24.500- 13:29.160* :  It said an ambush and an airstrike killed more than 40 Islamist militants and five soldiers
*13:29.340- 13:29.560* :  died.
*13:30.160- 13:34.680* :  Al Shabab said dozens of soldiers were killed in the raid and posted photos of its fighters
*13:35.040- 13:35.760* :  inside a base.
*13:36.260- 13:40.140* :  Two years ago the government launched an offensive to capture areas of central and southern
*13:40.140- 13:42.040* :  Somalia held by the militants.
*13:42.480- 13:47.020* :  After some initial success Al Shabab regrouped and recaptured some of that territory.
*13:47.380- 13:52.560* :  The latest fighting highlights the country's insecurity as thousands of African Union peacekeepers
*13:52.880- 13:55.740* :  are getting ready to pull out of Somalia by the end of the year.
*13:56.360- 13:56.860* :  Will Ross.
*13:57.960- 14:02.420* :  There's a dizzying array of possible outcomes from South Africa's election last week.
*14:02.420- 14:07.260* :  With no party winning a majority some kind of coalition will have to be cobbled together
*14:07.260- 14:12.840* :  but that won't be easy with bitter ideological and personal differences between the major
*14:12.840- 14:13.340* :  players.
*14:14.060- 14:18.400* :  Well, certain though is that the previously unchallenged status of the African National
*14:18.400- 14:23.500* :  Congress has now been swept away with a party for the first time getting less than half
*14:23.500- 14:24.080* :  the votes.
*14:24.500- 14:29.060* :  And as Barbara Plett Usher explains that's a bitter blow for those who devoted their
*14:29.060- 14:32.720* :  lives to the ANC and its struggle against apartheid.
*14:33.100- 14:40.020* :  We shall build the society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be
*14:40.020- 14:44.520* :  able to work tall without any fear in their hearts.
*14:45.000- 14:49.680* :  Nelson Mandela, 30 years ago, heralding the vision of a new South Africa in his inaugural
*14:49.680- 14:51.760* :  speech as the country's first black president.
*14:52.720- 14:57.600* :  Last week his party, the African National Congress, was punished at the polls for not delivering
*14:57.600- 14:57.880* :  it.
*14:58.220- 15:04.780* :  The number of the ANC for 66 years, so understandably, I'm very disappointed.
*15:05.420- 15:10.160* :  This is Mavuzum Semang, an ANC veteran who was on the front lines of the struggle against
*15:10.160- 15:10.860* :  apartheid.
*15:11.220- 15:14.120* :  Would you say this is the end of an era?
*15:14.760- 15:18.440* :  It marks a very important point in the life of the organization.
*15:18.480- 15:24.220* :  The fact that for the first time we aren't able to win the majority of votes and the
*15:24.220- 15:32.940* :  reason for that is that we have not heated the pleas of the people, namely that we are
*15:32.940- 15:37.040* :  suffering from the existence of corrupt people in your ranks.
*15:37.460- 15:42.840* :  The ANC was up against a lot when it gained power in 1994, but because of corruption and
*15:42.840- 15:48.060* :  economic mismanagement, it didn't fully reverse inequalities embedded by white minority rule,
*15:48.540- 15:50.780* :  even though it did end racial segregation.
*15:51.260- 15:57.040* :  It brought liberation to this country, then there were lots of expectations from Africa
*15:58.220- 16:03.900* :  that some of the disappointments that have happened after liberation would not occur here.
*16:04.240- 16:08.320* :  They declined that we see from the polls, what does that mean for that legacy?
*16:08.840- 16:12.820* :  Yes, I don't know how it will be retrieved, I hope this is not forever.
*16:13.460- 16:18.180* :  Right now what it means is tricky power-sharing talks because the major players have very
*16:18.180- 16:19.700* :  different visions for the country.
*16:27.340- 16:31.760* :  There's the MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma, which hasn't accepted the election
*16:31.760- 16:32.180* :  results.
*16:42.560- 16:48.660* :  The Marxist economic freedom fighters or EFF want to nationalize minds and seize white-owned
*16:48.660- 16:49.060* :  land.
*16:49.060- 16:55.300* :  The DA will make it our number one priority to prevent an ANC EFF Doomsday coalition
*16:56.020- 16:59.680* :  and the Pro-Business Democratic Alliance with a free market agenda.
*17:00.100- 17:04.680* :  Analysts Anusha Nidu is skeptical of fears that a government including a radical party
*17:04.680- 17:07.660* :  like the EFF could trigger economic disaster.
*17:08.180- 17:13.200* :  I think you're not going to get that kind of two extremes and that uncertainty I think
*17:13.200- 17:17.320* :  is what will happen for those who want to disrupt the political landscape.
*17:17.800- 17:19.900* :  Those who have the most at stake are young people.
*17:20.480- 17:25.560* :  So I've come to one of Johannesburg's biggest universities, Bitvatar-Srant, to ask students
*17:25.560- 17:27.380* :  what they think about this new future.
*17:27.940- 17:29.820* :  My name is Novile Khmalo.
*17:30.040- 17:31.320* :  My name is Lerartus Siva.
*17:31.700- 17:34.080* :  The ANC has lost its majority.
*17:34.820- 17:38.820* :  What do you think this means for South Africa?
*17:39.660- 17:43.780* :  I'm not sure what it looks like because it's new and I think that's the biggest thing
*17:43.780- 17:44.540* :  about this year.
*17:44.740- 17:46.620* :  Is that it seems like everybody just want to change?
*17:47.080- 17:50.840* :  For the country, I think a majority of the people at the moment were quite scared.
*17:50.880- 17:52.800* :  So I think that's just kind of that fear.
*17:52.800- 17:55.160* :  We don't know what's going to happen, but we know we want to change.
*17:55.420- 18:00.440* :  The shape of South Africa's new government will determine that future, much depends on
*18:00.440- 18:00.620* :  it.
*18:01.340- 18:02.640* :  Barbara Plett Asher.
*18:06.020- 18:06.640* :  Still to come.
*18:06.920- 18:11.680* :  At the moment we tend to rely on either seeing that somebody's not doing very well on memory
*18:11.680- 18:16.660* :  tests or showing that their brain has shrunk on a brain scan to help us make the diagnosis.
*18:17.380- 18:22.360* :  Scientists think they've made progress in predicting the onset of dementia and by nearly
*18:32.480- 18:32.660* :  a decade before the disease starts to take hold.
*18:32.700- 18:33.940* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mint Mobile.
*18:34.240- 18:38.100* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring
*18:38.100- 18:39.300* :  our prices down.
*18:39.700- 18:43.500* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer which is apparently a thing.
*18:43.920- 18:48.380* :  Mint Mobile, I'm limited, premium wireless, I need to get 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 20, 20, 20,

*19:24.240- 19:28.200* :  Quote today at Progressive.com Progressive casualty and trans company and affiliates,
*19:28.200- 19:32.600* :  National average 12 month savings of $744 by new customer surveyed who saved with Progressive
*19:32.600- 19:34.300* :  between June 2022 and May 2023.
*19:34.680- 19:35.480* :  Potential savings will vary.
*19:35.480- 19:37.160* :  Discount is not available in all states and situations.
*19:43.300- 19:44.960* :  This is the Global News Podcast.
*19:45.600- 19:47.340* :  Now, how's this for inflation?
*19:47.540- 19:50.660* :  Egypt is quadrupling the price of bread.
*19:51.160- 19:55.660* :  The government has slashed the subsidy it provides for what is to many people a crucial
*19:55.660- 19:56.700* :  source of nutrition.
*19:57.160- 20:01.320* :  Around two thirds of Egyptians rely on buying bread at a reduced cost.
*20:01.820- 20:06.140* :  This sudden leap in price has come about because the authorities had put off making
*20:06.140- 20:08.600* :  any changes to the subsidy for many years.
*20:09.180- 20:12.180* :  This because the last time they tried it, there were riots.
*20:12.220- 20:15.580* :  From the Egyptian capital Cairo, here's Salina Biel.
*20:18.240- 20:20.560* :  No Egyptian family can do without bread.
*20:21.460- 20:25.460* :  Egyptians refer to bread as a laish or livelihood.
*20:26.220- 20:32.140* :  It's a unique term in the Arab world that sums up how indispensable bread is in every
*20:32.140- 20:32.980* :  Egyptian meal.
*20:33.620- 20:38.880* :  This basic item has always been subsidized by different governments who have avoided
*20:38.880- 20:40.640* :  a rousing public anger.
*20:41.080- 20:46.520* :  But under the current military-backed president Abdifat-e-Hassisi, the government has raised
*20:46.520- 20:51.420* :  the price of subsidized bread by 300 percent in one go.
*20:53.640- 20:58.840* :  Nearly two thirds of more than 100 million Egyptians depend on subsidized bread.
*20:59.340- 21:05.780* :  The fourth fall dries in prices will burden many households who already struggle to put
*21:05.900- 21:06.800* :  food on the table.
*21:07.460- 21:13.220* :  For the past years, the government has implemented a set of austerity measures that have totally
*21:13.220- 21:18.700* :  or partially lifted subsidies of basic commodities like food and fuel.
*21:19.680- 21:23.980* :  The authorities see this as part of its so-called economic reforms.
*21:25.660- 21:30.960* :  The people we spoke to disagree to this argument, but they sounded helpless.
*21:32.880- 21:35.660* :  No matter how much I earn, I feel I'm not alive.
*21:35.780- 21:37.920* :  I can't afford to eat what I like.
*21:40.060- 21:42.700* :  Nothing is more important than bread, but what can we do?
*21:42.700- 21:44.300* :  This is how our life is now.
*21:47.360- 21:51.960* :  When the price of subsidized bread rises, the price of non-subsidized bread will go up too.
*21:52.400- 21:55.120* :  It's already 150 p.s. per loaf.
*21:55.240- 22:02.080* :  The price of subsidized bread was last raised in 1988, when it more than doubled in cost
*22:02.260- 22:03.400* :  to its current price.
*22:03.920- 22:08.460* :  Since then, it remained unchanged, but the size has been shrinking.
*22:10.160- 22:18.000* :  When President C.C. took power in 2014, a loaf of bread went down from 130 grams to 120,
*22:18.140- 22:20.880* :  that's around 4.5 ounces.
*22:21.340- 22:28.300* :  It continued to decrease until it reached 90 grams, or just over 3 ounces in 2020.
*22:30.840- 22:38.500* :  Let's weigh in this small loaf of bread and see, what, it's not even 90 grams, it's
*22:38.500- 22:39.500* :  only 75.
*22:41.200- 22:45.720* :  Egypt is already suffering from huge budget deficit and crippling debts.
*22:46.480- 22:52.040* :  It's on its fifth loan from the International Monetary Fund, making it one of the largest
*22:52.040- 22:53.900* :  borrowers from the IMF.
*22:56.860- 23:03.020* :  In a cabinet meeting, Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Medbouli said, downsizing bread subsidies
*23:06.820- 23:06.860* :  was inevitable.
*23:07.940- 23:12.960* :  A loaf of bread costs the government 125 p.s. and it's sold for 5.
*23:13.560- 23:16.540* :  For the government, shoulders the burden of 120 p.s.
*23:17.300- 23:22.700* :  If we multiply that by 100 billion loaves per year, we're talking here about 120 billion
*23:22.700- 23:23.800* :  Egyptian pounds.
*23:26.200- 23:32.740* :  Successive governments have always argued, food subsidies eat up a big chunk of the state's
*23:32.740- 23:37.060* :  budget, but they have been quite cautious when it comes to bread prices.
*23:41.500- 23:48.080* :  In 1977, late President Anwar Sadat took the risk of raising bread prices.
*23:48.500- 23:55.320* :  The result was wild protests and riots that swept across the country, eventually he had
*23:55.320- 23:56.180* :  to back off.
*23:58.760- 24:04.320* :  The state might save millions of dollars from raising bread prices, but this will come
*24:04.320- 24:05.060* :  with a cost.
*24:05.560- 24:11.680* :  Many people will see a further squeeze to their budgets, and it's not clear how they
*24:11.680- 24:12.280* :  will react.
*24:15.840- 24:21.680* :  Dementia causes misery around the world, both for the 55 million who suffer from the condition,
*24:22.360- 24:27.360* :  and perhaps even more for those who care for them, but Dementia is also a killer, according
*24:27.360- 24:32.040* :  to the World Health Organization, it's the planet's seventh leading cause of death.
*24:32.660- 24:38.660* :  But to find a cure has been slow with plenty of false hopes quickly dashed, but now scientists
*24:38.660- 24:43.980* :  think they've made progress, at least in predicting dementia's onset, and by nearly a decade
*24:43.980- 24:45.580* :  before the disease starts.
*24:45.580- 24:50.340* :  It involves better memory tests and also measurements of brain shrinkage.
*24:50.380- 24:55.880* :  James Copdall spoke to Professor Charles Marshall, who led the research at Queen Mary University
*24:55.880- 24:56.480* :  in London.
*24:57.100- 25:01.580* :  So we know that when people develop problems with their memory and go to see their doctor
*25:01.580- 25:07.080* :  and get a diagnosis of dementia, their brain has been changing for 10 to 20 years by that
*25:07.080- 25:07.440* :  time.
*25:08.300- 25:13.280* :  And at the moment, we tend to rely on either seeing that somebody's not doing very well
*25:13.280- 25:17.960* :  on memory tests or showing that their brain has shrunk on a brain scan to help us make
*25:17.960- 25:23.540* :  the diagnosis, but before those things are evident, the way that the different regions
*25:23.540- 25:28.640* :  of the brain talk to each other starts to be affected by the loss of brain cells in
*25:30.080- 25:30.100* :  dementia.
*25:30.140- 25:31.600* :  And that's what we were able to show in this study.
*25:31.600- 25:34.760* :  So we looked at functional brain scans.
*25:34.760- 25:40.280* :  So that's when somebody's lying in a brain scanner and the MRI scan is able to pick up
*25:40.660- 25:42.700* :  how active different regions of the brain are.
*25:43.240- 25:47.320* :  And we can use that to show how strongly connected the brain regions are.
*25:47.800- 25:52.080* :  And we were able to show that the strength of connections between brain regions could predict
*25:52.080- 25:54.420* :  who was going to get dementia up to nine years in the future.
*25:54.920- 25:59.640* :  What we would really like to do is to find treatments that we can give people that can
*25:59.640- 26:05.120* :  prevent them from losing brain cells and prevent them from developing dementia, because once
*26:05.120- 26:07.120* :  people lose brain cells, we can't replace them.
*26:07.980- 26:11.740* :  And so we would like to be able to treat the condition as early as possible, ideally
*26:11.740- 26:13.180* :  even before people get symptoms.
*26:13.180- 26:18.040* :  So what I hope is that this might allow us to have a better way of finding people who
*26:18.040- 26:22.720* :  are at risk of developing dementia to go into trials of treatments so that we can find
*26:23.540- 26:27.140* :  those things that are going to change the situation that we have at the moment where
*26:27.140- 26:29.520* :  there is no effective treatment available to people.
*26:29.780- 26:35.600* :  This then requires quite expensive technology and MRI scan of that sort of thing.
*26:35.600- 26:39.060* :  It's not something perhaps readily available all around the world.
*26:39.500- 26:40.020* :  No, that's right.
*26:40.020- 26:43.560* :  It does require an MRI scan, but it could be done on any MRI scanner.
*26:43.780- 26:49.700* :  So certainly here in the UK, an MRI scan tends to be a standard part of the process for
*26:49.700- 26:51.440* :  getting a dementia diagnosis at the moment.
*26:51.740- 26:55.600* :  And a typical MRI scan would take about 30 to 40 minutes.
*26:56.140- 26:59.880* :  And this part is about six minutes of additional MRI scanning.
*26:59.880- 27:06.200* :  So not hugely infeasible to build this in if we were able to show with more research that
*27:06.200- 27:07.920* :  it would be helpful in that setting.
*27:08.440- 27:13.420* :  And I suppose for people like you who work on this sort of topic on dementia and all
*27:13.420- 27:16.800* :  its rather horrible effects, this is a pretty exciting moment.
*27:17.180- 27:17.940* :  You were very excited.
*27:17.940- 27:24.120* :  We know that we would like to dream of a future where we can do things to protect people's
*27:24.120- 27:29.400* :  brains from dementia and we need to identify who the right people are to give those sorts
*27:29.400- 27:30.120* :  of treatments to.
*27:30.120- 27:34.640* :  And so this sort of thing could be the first step on the road towards being able to do that.
*27:35.100- 27:38.240* :  Professor Charles Marshall of London's Queen Mary University.
*27:39.160- 27:43.220* :  Now, does Japan want people to view Mount Fuji or not?
*27:43.580- 27:48.200* :  This month, we were reporting that authorities had put up a barrier in a town near the mountain
*27:48.700- 27:50.680* :  to stop people taking pictures from there.
*27:50.780- 27:54.160* :  Apparently, locals have been complaining that there were too many tourists.
*27:54.980- 27:59.560* :  But now comes news that a ten story building is being demolished because it's blocking
*27:59.560- 28:00.720* :  the view of Mount Fuji.
*28:00.720- 28:02.620* :  Mickey Bristow has this story.
*28:03.060- 28:07.640* :  Before the condominium went up, there was a clear view of the famous peak, including
*28:07.640- 28:12.560* :  its summit right along the main street in the city of Kunitachi near Tokyo.
*28:13.360- 28:16.640* :  Indeed, the road itself is called Mount Fuji View.
*28:17.400- 28:21.400* :  Once the apartment block was built though, half the mountain was obscured.
*28:22.040- 28:25.980* :  Local residents have been complaining about the loss of their view since work on the
*28:25.980- 28:26.640* :  building began.
*28:27.320- 28:32.120* :  Meetings were held, and the developer agreed to adjust the design of the Rau Rumble
*28:32.160- 28:32.400* :  Don.
*28:33.180- 28:38.120* :  Now, suddenly the build was decided to tear the whole structure down, just before its
*28:38.160- 28:40.100* :  first residence were due to move-in.
*28:40.720- 28:46.320* :  A firm said it hadn't properly considered the impact on the surrounding landscape, leaving
*28:46.320- 28:53.240* :  the residents of Mount Fuji View to continue enjoying the unspoiled sight of one of Japan's
*28:53.240- 28:54.460* :  most memorable images.
*28:55.040- 28:59.940* :  Mickey Bristow, now speaking of photography, it was one of the most famous snaps ever
*29:00.400- 29:00.420* :  taken.
*29:00.580- 29:02.780* :  Certainly one of the most famous taken in space.
*29:03.640- 29:08.920* :  The year was 1968, and the American astronaut, William Anders, pointed his camera out of the
*29:08.920- 29:15.140* :  window of his Apollo spacecraft, and shot an iconic image of planet Earth, half lit by
*29:15.140- 29:18.460* :  the sun, floating in the midst of the solar system's darkness.
*29:19.020- 29:23.640* :  Just a scientist always knew it did, but in a way that only that view from a distance
*29:23.640- 29:24.640* :  could really capture.
*29:25.380- 29:29.780* :  Well, William Anders has been killed in an aeroplane accident he was 90 years old.
*29:30.280- 29:34.860* :  U.S. media report he'd been flying a small plane which crashed into the sea off Washington
*29:34.860- 29:35.280* :  state.
*29:35.800- 29:41.300* :  We have the moment he took the picture, and also, Bill Anders later telling the BBC how
*29:41.300- 29:42.040* :  he remembered it.
*29:42.760- 29:44.340* :  Oh my god, look at that picture over there.
*29:44.940- 29:46.280* :  It's the Earth coming up.
*29:46.580- 29:47.320* :  Wow, that's pretty.
*29:48.280- 29:54.280* :  Suddenly out of my window, I called out that it would be, wow, look at that, and the
*29:54.280- 29:58.140* :  other's, uh, poke their noses out the window or in the windows too.
*29:59.040- 30:07.600* :  So here was this beautiful planet coming up over a rather stark lunar horizon, and
*30:07.600- 30:13.960* :  after three orbits in lunar orbit, we had all basically decided that the moon was pretty
*30:14.060- 30:14.720* :  boring place.
*30:14.840- 30:18.440* :  I mean, it was nothing but a bunch of holes turned up battlefield.
*30:19.100- 30:28.460* :  And so here was this only color in the universe as it was contrasted by the stark
*30:28.940- 30:29.180* :  moon.
*30:30.240- 30:36.960* :  And so, uh, I got a camera with a long lens and color film and started snapping pictures
*30:37.880- 30:42.200* :  of the moon, one of which turned out to be what has become the iconic Earth-Rise photo.
*30:42.700- 30:43.720* :  You got a color film, Jim?
*30:44.520- 30:44.920* :  Hand me a roll of color film.
*30:44.920- 30:45.560* :  Oh, man.
*30:45.580- 30:46.760* :  That's cool.
*30:46.760- 30:47.040* :  That's cool.
*30:47.040- 30:47.120* :  That's cool.
*30:48.300- 30:48.580* :  Great.
*30:50.840- 30:50.880* :  Thanks, Phil.
*30:50.880- 30:51.660* :  Great trouble up here.
*30:51.660- 30:52.840* :  Man, I mean, I've got the right setting here.
*30:52.900- 30:53.620* :  That's cool.
*30:54.560- 30:54.860* :  That's cool.
*30:54.860- 30:55.360* :  That's cool.
*30:55.360- 30:56.200* :  I got it right.
*30:56.200- 30:56.480* :  Oh, that's a beautiful shot.
*30:57.960- 31:02.820* :  Bill Anders, well, my BBC colleague, Lauren Taylor, spoke to Lee Roy Chow, a fellow former
*31:02.820- 31:06.140* :  astronaut who was once commander of the International Space Station.
*31:06.180- 31:08.260* :  He paid Bill Anders this tribute.
*31:09.200- 31:11.200* :  Very nice man, but also very serious.
*31:11.200- 31:16.040* :  The consummate astronaut and pilot, you know, he went on and lived a very full life.
*31:16.060- 31:20.180* :  He ran general dynamics after he left NASA and continued to fly.
*31:20.180- 31:20.860* :  Fly airplane.
*31:21.060- 31:27.060* :  He turned 90 earlier this year and was still by all accounts sharp as attack and very
*31:27.060- 31:29.400* :  physically active and, of course, still flying.
*31:29.400- 31:34.860* :  And so it's sad that he died in a plane crash, but, you know, he lived a full life and
*31:34.860- 31:35.780* :  was doing what he loved.
*31:36.000- 31:38.220* :  And tell us what you think his legacy will be?
*31:38.960- 31:43.800* :  Well, certainly the Apollo 8 mission was a very daring mission, a very bold mission,
*31:44.300- 31:49.720* :  kind of conceived, you know, very late in the game for the launch, as far as mission planning
*31:49.720- 31:50.060* :  goes.
*31:50.600- 31:55.060* :  And it was a gamble that the Americans, the United States, took to go ahead and go
*31:55.060- 31:59.040* :  around the moon with the Apollo spacecraft because our lunar lander wasn't ready yet.
*31:59.300- 32:04.760* :  And so, as you pointed out, Bill took that iconic earth rice picture that is still seen
*32:04.760- 32:05.560* :  all the time.
*32:05.960- 32:11.900* :  I've used it myself and, you know, he will be remembered and missed by all of us, but
*32:12.320- 32:14.080* :  especially among us, professional astronauts.
*32:14.520- 32:18.240* :  And Bill Anders said about that moment when he took the photo, he said, we came all this
*32:18.240- 32:21.480* :  way to explore the moon and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth.
*32:21.960- 32:22.680* :  What are your reflections?
*32:22.760- 32:26.640* :  You've been one of the rare people who has actually been in space to tell us about what
*32:26.640- 32:27.140* :  that's like.
*32:27.440- 32:28.200* :  Sure, absolutely.
*32:28.220- 32:32.460* :  I mean, there's nothing better when you're in space than to look back at the Earth and
*32:32.460- 32:34.540* :  marvel at the beauty of our planet.
*32:34.820- 32:38.720* :  Every part looks different its own way and it's much more colorful and vibrant than you
*32:38.720- 32:39.340* :  might imagine.
*32:39.340- 32:44.800* :  The Apollo astronauts so far are the only ones who have seen Earth in its entirety when
*32:44.800- 32:49.740* :  they, you know, go far enough away to see it because since the Apollo program, of course,
*32:49.740- 32:51.520* :  all astronauts have been in low-rather orbit.
*32:51.700- 32:56.760* :  But still, we didn't quite get the perspective they did, but, you know, flying in low-rather
*32:56.760- 32:59.260* :  orbit for gosh, two-thirds of a year or so.
*32:59.260- 33:04.660* :  I did get to see a lot of it and understand what he meant by those words.
*33:05.800- 33:07.920* :  The former astronaut, Leroy Chao.
*33:08.640- 33:13.840* :  As we heard earlier in the podcast last week saw the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings
*33:14.260- 33:18.640* :  when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in northern France to begin the
*33:18.640- 33:21.680* :  process of liberating Europe from Nazi occupation.
*33:22.300- 33:26.540* :  Among those at the commemoration ceremonies were many who'd taken part in the operation,
*33:27.220- 33:32.040* :  but the occasion was particularly momentous for one American veteran, a hundred-year-old
*33:32.040- 33:38.620* :  Harold Terrens used the opportunity to marry his 96-year-old fiancée, Ella Bignol reports.
*33:42.340- 33:48.280* :  Sporting a light blue suit, a pink rose and his military medal, a gleeful Harold Terrens
*33:48.280- 33:50.460* :  walked down the aisle towards his bride.
*33:53.620- 33:58.400* :  The hundred-year-old from Florida was in Normandy for D-Day celebrations, where he served
*33:58.400- 34:03.220* :  as a radio technician, assisting fighter pilots in the skies over northern France.
*34:03.760- 34:08.760* :  He wanted to commemorate the event by marrying his 96-year-old fiancée, Jean Swirlin.
*34:09.180- 34:14.460* :  They tied the knot in the small town of Carrantont-Lémaré, near the very beaches the Allies landed
*34:14.460- 34:15.840* :  on 80 years ago.
*34:19.020- 34:27.820* :  My religion is love. I believe in love. I taught my family wherever they go. Just love.
*34:28.320- 34:33.960* :  Mr Terrens was awarded the French Legion of Honor by President Macron in 2019. During
*34:33.960- 34:39.000* :  the war he was also part of a secret mission that took him to Soviet Ukraine via Casablanca,
*34:39.000- 34:46.020* :  Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Cairo, Bandad, as well as Terren, but he said Normandy will
*34:46.020- 34:48.080* :  always have a place in his heart.
*34:48.080- 34:57.220* :  The best time of my entire life. I'm 100 years old and my bride is 96. Norman is my second
*34:57.220- 34:59.820* :  favorite place in the whole world.
*35:00.420- 35:06.100* :  Both widowed Harold and Jean were introduced to each other by a friend in 2021. The two
*35:06.100- 35:08.260* :  have been inseparable ever since.
*35:08.780- 35:16.940* :  I waited 96 years to find the right guy. Well, better late than ever. I mean, it's not
*35:16.940- 35:22.580* :  just for young people, you know. We get butterflies and we get a little action also.
*35:24.500- 35:30.100* :  After a modest 1940s-themed reception, next stop for the newlyweds, Paris, for a dinner
*35:30.100- 35:32.520* :  with President Spiden and Macron.
*35:33.080- 35:33.740* :  Ella Bignell.
*35:37.000- 35:40.780* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
