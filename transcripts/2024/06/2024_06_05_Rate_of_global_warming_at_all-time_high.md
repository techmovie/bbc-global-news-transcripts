*00:21.120- 00:23.580* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.040* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.040- 00:31.300* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.560- 00:36.580* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:25.380- 01:30.340* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, we are recording this at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 5th of June.
*01:30.700- 01:35.280* :  Climate scientists warn that the rate of global warming is at an all-time high.
*01:36.060- 01:40.680* :  For women registered as candidates for Iran's presidential election, but do they stand
*01:40.700- 01:41.240* :  a chance?
*01:42.200- 01:46.700* :  And mass graves and body bags, what happened during the Israeli raid on El Shifa Hospital
*01:46.700- 01:47.360* :  in Gaza?
*01:50.220- 01:55.160* :  Also in the podcast, the high price being paid by the victims of sex torsion.
*01:55.460- 02:00.120* :  These people are just going through the script and putting that pressure on, and they're
*02:00.120- 02:03.600* :  doing it quick because then they can move on to the next person because it's about volume.
*02:04.220- 02:08.220* :  And the contribution of women to the D-Day landings 80 years ago.
*02:12.860- 02:17.520* :  Even the scorching temperatures seen over the past year, it may not come as a surprise,
*02:17.740- 02:23.140* :  but a new report says human activity is heating up the world at a record rate.
*02:23.720- 02:28.740* :  The climate scientists behind the study are warning that the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius
*02:28.740- 02:32.660* :  above pre-industrial levels could be breached within five years.
*02:33.380- 02:37.760* :  In a speech to mark world environment, day the UN Secretary General will warn that
*02:37.760- 02:41.740* :  the world is not doing enough to switch away from coal, oil, and gas.
*02:42.520- 02:45.480* :  One of the authors of the new report is Karina von Schuchmann.
*02:46.120- 02:52.520* :  What we are aiming for is to provide annual tracks between the different IPCC reports
*02:52.520- 02:54.620* :  which are published every seven years.
*02:54.740- 03:00.740* :  It is clear that there is a rapid need of taking action to reduce carbon emissions.
*03:00.740- 03:07.460* :  If we do not act today, the window on missing 1.5 degrees is closing.
*03:08.000- 03:11.400* :  Our environment correspondent Matt McGraw told me more about the findings.
*03:12.220- 03:15.060* :  Yes, this is a report called the Indicators of Global Change.
*03:15.060- 03:18.620* :  It is being published as you heard in the clip there to fill in the gaps
*03:18.620- 03:21.000* :  when the UN's official body isn't meeting.
*03:21.000- 03:24.460* :  Their report about every six to seven years on the state of the climate.
*03:24.460- 03:29.200* :  Now, this report, as you said, highlights the fact that global warming is increasing.
*03:29.200- 03:34.140* :  It is increasing it about just over a quarter of a degree Celsius per decade.
*03:34.500- 03:39.440* :  That is up from the 1970s and 1980s when it was about 0.18 Celsius per decade.
*03:39.440- 03:44.920* :  So, they say it is at a high level warming, increasing at a rate not seen before.
*03:44.980- 03:50.780* :  They point out that last year was about 1.43 degrees warmer than the long-term average,
*03:50.780- 03:53.300* :  the 1850 degree, the 1850 records.
*03:54.000- 03:55.760* :  But most of that came from human activities.
*03:55.760- 03:59.880* :  About 92 percent was that down to human activities and about 8 percent due to natural events
*03:59.880- 04:01.860* :  such as El Nino, which we have talked about before.
*04:02.220- 04:06.140* :  This warning about the 1.5 degree threshold, is there anything that can be done?
*04:06.420- 04:10.140* :  Yes, I mean, it comes in a long line of warnings of telling people that, you know,
*04:10.140- 04:13.340* :  that this threshold, which was agreed in the Paris Agreement in 2015,
*04:13.340- 04:16.620* :  and is it critically important to developing states and small island states
*04:17.080- 04:21.240* :  that that threshold should be gone, could be gone, surpassed in five years or so?
*04:21.620- 04:25.420* :  That's obviously the nature of the warning is very stark from and we'll hear probably later
*04:25.420- 04:28.040* :  today from the UN Secretary General more about that.
*04:28.520- 04:32.340* :  And countries are girding up to try and put plans in place to cut emissions to that level.
*04:32.360- 04:34.580* :  But at the moment, those emissions are still going up.
*04:35.020- 04:37.300* :  They may be slowing down in their rise, but they're still going up.
*04:37.660- 04:39.700* :  And that puts that target very much in danger.
*04:39.700- 04:42.740* :  And more scientists will admit privately it's a gunner.
*04:43.020- 04:48.980* :  We keep hearing skepticism from some politicians that people are willing to take action.
*04:48.980- 04:53.560* :  So if it's a gunner, are we going to have to think about perhaps a new strategy?
*04:53.880- 04:57.220* :  Yes, indeed. I'm sure that that is informing the minds of scientists and politicians.
*04:57.260- 05:02.440* :  I think the big question with these type of reports, the big issue really here that scientists really worry about,
*05:02.740- 05:06.620* :  is whether or not the rate of warme is accelerating and whether we're going to hit some
*05:07.160- 05:09.580* :  tripping points that will really make things much worse.
*05:09.880- 05:14.140* :  Now, while the rate of increase seen in these reports and today's report
*05:14.500- 05:18.300* :  is the highest on record, the scientists take some comfort from the fact
*05:18.300- 05:20.500* :  that it's not beyond the bounds of what they predicted.
*05:20.500- 05:24.580* :  Essentially, it's where they said we would be at several decades ago.
*05:24.860- 05:27.120* :  It's not going any faster than that.
*05:27.120- 05:29.920* :  And that is some small comfort in this particular report.
*05:30.520- 05:32.360* :  Our environment correspondent Matt McGraw.
*05:33.140- 05:37.420* :  The Gaza ceasefire plan set out by President Biden last week has still not been
*05:37.420- 05:42.480* :  agreed by Hamas or by Israel, where the far right Minister Itamar Ben Gavir today
*05:42.480- 05:44.240* :  stepped up his opposition to it.
*05:44.660- 05:49.700* :  The proposal is due to be discussed by security officials from the US, Egypt and Qatar.
*05:50.320- 05:55.400* :  But as the talking goes on, Israel has announced a new military campaign in central Gaza.
*05:56.180- 06:01.260* :  Nearly eight months after the 7th of October massacre, it has been unable to defeat Hamas
*06:01.260- 06:03.780* :  and has returned to the scene of previous battles.
*06:04.620- 06:08.120* :  In March, Israel carried out a second raid on Al-Shifah Hospital,
*06:08.120- 06:13.320* :  where it said it killed more than 200 terrorists without a single civilian casualty.
*06:13.820- 06:17.580* :  However, the BBC has found evidence that civilians were killed.
*06:17.620- 06:22.580* :  From Istanbul, our Gaza correspondent, Ruchti Abu Aluf, has this report which some
*06:22.580- 06:24.220* :  listeners may find distressing.
*06:25.860- 06:30.600* :  On the 1st of April, Palestinians boored over the ruins of what was once
*06:30.820- 06:32.020* :  Gaza's biggest hospital.
*06:32.820- 06:36.840* :  Israeli forces had just ended their second military raid at Al-Shifah.
*06:38.820- 06:43.880* :  Since then, local search teams say they have found four massive graves and have dug
*06:43.880- 06:49.340* :  up hundreds of bodies at the site. It's led to international calls for an investigation
*06:49.840- 06:51.120* :  into possible war crimes.
*06:51.800- 06:56.020* :  Rami the Babish from the Palestinian Civil Defence told us of suspicious finds.
*06:58.020- 07:02.440* :  We've discovered bodies of women and children and people without heads,
*07:03.000- 07:04.700* :  as well as torn body parts.
*07:06.820- 07:12.060* :  The Israeli military says it did exhumed bodies which Palestinians had buried earlier,
*07:12.540- 07:15.020* :  as it searched for hostages seized by Hamas.
*07:15.360- 07:18.220* :  But some of those found in the graves were patients.
*07:19.100- 07:24.260* :  Walid Fatima believes his ill-dare mother Lina died of malnutrition and dehydration.
*07:24.800- 07:26.960* :  Her corpse was badly decomposed.
*07:28.180- 07:32.180* :  I identified her from Particular Marks on her legs.
*07:32.540- 07:36.680* :  She'd been wounded in November and had a toe amputated on each foot.
*07:39.200- 07:43.080* :  Israeli blames and it did suck patients on natural causes.
*07:43.880- 07:48.960* :  But the local representative of the World Health Organization, Dr. Rik Peparkorn,
*07:49.560- 07:54.740* :  who went to visit Al-Shifah, seized those trapped endured horrific conditions.
*07:55.160- 07:57.640* :  During the siege, 20 patients died.
*07:57.900- 07:59.760* :  However, patients who couldn't get oxygen,
*07:59.840- 08:02.940* :  there was not proper medication, but also the food and water.
*08:02.940- 08:06.820* :  The story is that 15 people had to share one bottle of water.
*08:07.960- 08:11.920* :  Israel's army seized Palestinian gunmen were based inside Al-Shifah
*08:12.580- 08:17.720* :  and killed more than 200 Hamas and Islamic jihad operatives in a space of two weeks.
*08:18.260- 08:20.720* :  The Israeli government spokesman Avi Haiman,
*08:21.300- 08:23.100* :  gave a briefing at the end of the raid.
*08:23.100- 08:27.080* :  Shifah has become a main terrorism command center for Hamas.
*08:27.160- 08:30.480* :  The surprise action by our forces was precise and surgical.
*08:32.840- 08:37.500* :  But the fighting with Palestinian armed groups reached the streets around the hospital.
*08:38.200- 08:39.740* :  There was widespread destruction.
*08:40.580- 08:44.880* :  I spoke to witnesses who told me that many civilians had been killed.
*08:45.740- 08:49.960* :  One man told me he was a sole survivor of an Israeli aristrike
*08:50.340- 08:52.680* :  that killed 23 members of his family.
*08:52.980- 08:56.580* :  This was somebody who wanted to develop as a well-rounded surgeon
*08:56.580- 09:00.660* :  who was utterly committed to his people and to work in Gaza.
*09:01.040- 09:03.800* :  Dr. Ahmad Al-Makadma was dedicated surgeon.
*09:04.500- 09:08.160* :  He was shot dead close to the hospital where he were.
*09:08.720- 09:11.440* :  The BBC spoke to a two-pritish plastic surgeon,
*09:11.440- 09:13.800* :  Tim Gudeker, who helped train him.
*09:14.040- 09:17.580* :  He was hungry for knowledge. He was a very gentle and somebody who
*09:17.580- 09:20.120* :  all of us would want to have as our sort of doctors.
*09:20.740- 09:24.220* :  Dr. Ahmad was off shift and at home near Al-Shifah hospital
*09:24.760- 09:26.340* :  when Israeli forces moved in.
*09:27.060- 09:31.640* :  He was stuck there for four days and interrogated by Israeli soldiers.
*09:32.180- 09:36.620* :  Dr. Ahmad then tried to leave Gaza City on foot with his mother Yusra.
*09:38.000- 09:41.380* :  His father, Said, told us they found his decomposed body
*09:41.920- 09:43.660* :  11 days after he disappeared.
*09:44.380- 09:48.980* :  The Israeli's military says it's unaware of the death of the surgeon and his mother.
*09:51.380- 09:54.160* :  Many in Gaza are still searching for their loved ones
*09:54.800- 09:58.040* :  who have been missing since their aid in Al-Shifah hospital in April.
*09:58.860- 10:02.820* :  International forensic experts cannot access the site
*10:03.920- 10:07.380* :  and many worried that full truth of what happened here
*10:08.280- 10:09.420* :  may never be uncovered.
*10:10.120- 10:12.420* :  Al-Ghazza correspondent Rishdi Abu al-Uf.
*10:13.280- 10:17.380* :  The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, told his supporters yesterday he was,
*10:17.380- 10:20.940* :  quote, very, very happy with the outcome of the general election.
*10:21.700- 10:24.520* :  But he can't have been too pleased to lose his majority,
*10:24.880- 10:28.680* :  getting 160 fewer seats than he'd been aiming for.
*10:29.100- 10:31.300* :  Instead of presiding over a supermajority,
*10:31.780- 10:33.860* :  which will allow him to change the constitution,
*10:33.860- 10:37.460* :  he's now having to build a coalition in order to govern.
*10:38.100- 10:39.940* :  But what does that mean for the Indian economy?
*10:39.940- 10:43.380* :  Here's our India business correspondent, Arunade Mukaji.
*10:44.340- 10:49.520* :  Earlier the BJP with absolute majority had no compulsion to take other parties along,
*10:49.520- 10:52.800* :  whenever it needed to enact laws or outline spending.
*10:52.800- 10:55.040* :  But now for the first time since 2014,
*10:55.040- 10:58.700* :  India is back to an era of coalition politics,
*10:59.360- 11:01.780* :  which means consensus will be key.
*11:01.920- 11:04.460* :  India might be one of the fastest growing economies in the world,
*11:04.900- 11:07.060* :  but there are challenges ahead for the next five years.
*11:07.880- 11:11.340* :  Unemployment among India's educated youth has increased,
*11:12.080- 11:14.620* :  inequality has widened to a hundred year high,
*11:15.060- 11:18.940* :  and manufacturing as a share of GDP has remained stagnant for a decade.
*11:19.760- 11:24.020* :  As India aims to become the third largest economy in the world in the next three years,
*11:24.760- 11:28.120* :  the next five years for the government in power will be key.
*11:28.960- 11:32.260* :  And with coalition politics back, the question is,
*11:32.880- 11:37.160* :  will economics drive politics or will politics drive economics?
*11:37.920- 11:41.220* :  Arunade Mukaji in Delhi, and as we record this podcast,
*11:41.220- 11:46.440* :  we've just heard a statement from India that the Modi-led alliance has now agreed
*11:46.440- 11:48.840* :  to form the next Indian government.
*11:50.020- 11:53.120* :  Last week, a SNAP election was announced in Iran,
*11:53.120- 11:56.280* :  following the death of President Reisi in a helicopter crash.
*11:57.000- 12:01.260* :  Candidate registration closed on Monday with 80 people signing up,
*12:01.660- 12:02.940* :  including four women.
*12:03.700- 12:06.700* :  But in the 45-year history of the Islamic Republic,
*12:06.700- 12:10.340* :  no woman has ever been allowed to stand for Iranian President.
*12:11.220- 12:12.140* :  So will they this time?
*12:12.140- 12:16.020* :  I asked Farhanak Amidi, the world's service women's affairs reporter.
*12:16.900- 12:19.180* :  I really find that unlikely to happen.
*12:19.200- 12:21.900* :  With the situation we are seeing right now in Iran,
*12:21.900- 12:27.460* :  with clamp down on women and normalization of violence against women on the streets and
*12:27.460- 12:30.520* :  pavements across the country by morality police.
*12:30.640- 12:34.680* :  It is very unlikely to see that you're going to have a female President
*12:34.680- 12:38.340* :  or to be able to even run for Presidency and pass the vetting,
*12:38.820- 12:43.400* :  because the system has a lot of Iranian women's rights activists and political activists
*12:43.400- 12:45.960* :  call the regime a gender apartheid.
*12:45.960- 12:51.200* :  The whole system is designed to keep women at the best of the situation's second-class citizens.
*12:51.800- 12:55.700* :  So it is very unlikely for that to happen and for them to actually pass the vetting.
*12:55.700- 13:00.000* :  No woman has ever passed the vetting of the Council of Experts.
*13:00.240- 13:02.460* :  Given that, why would they put their names forward?
*13:02.920- 13:07.760* :  Well, a lot of people might look at it and think that these women are there to push boundaries
*13:07.760- 13:09.820* :  and challenge the status quo.
*13:10.300- 13:14.700* :  I mean, there was one woman who was doing that back in the 90s and she registered twice.
*13:14.700- 13:16.960* :  That was delayed as Amtala Rani.
*13:16.960- 13:22.020* :  But these women, from what they were saying, the speeches they've done after the registration,
*13:22.020- 13:27.160* :  they basically say that we've been so loyal to the Constitution, to the Supreme Leader,
*13:27.160- 13:33.920* :  and they are kind of demanding a reward for their loyalty rather than thinking or planning
*13:33.920- 13:35.080* :  to push boundaries.
*13:35.080- 13:38.420* :  None of these women, these four women, in their slogans
*13:38.740- 13:42.260* :  for their to-be campaigns, have even mentioned women.
*13:42.660- 13:43.140* :  None of them.
*13:43.300- 13:47.200* :  So women's rights, women's issues are not part of their agenda.
*13:47.200- 13:52.360* :  And that is quite telling because we have seen women protesting in Iran
*13:52.500- 13:57.760* :  and being on the forefront of the protests of the so-called woman life freedom protests
*13:58.280- 14:00.000* :  in the country, across the country.
*14:00.380- 14:04.900* :  And it's quite telling that none of these female candidates are even mentioning women
*14:05.000- 14:05.880* :  and their slogans.
*14:06.080- 14:06.860* :  I was going to ask you.
*14:06.880- 14:11.560* :  I mean, after the death of Masa Amine and those protests against the strict Islamic
*14:11.560- 14:15.560* :  dress that women are forced to wear in Iran, I was wondering if there might be
*14:16.020- 14:19.100* :  perhaps some kind of rethinking at the top that maybe they have to
*14:19.560- 14:21.480* :  slightly ease conditions for women.
*14:22.000- 14:25.540* :  That's not actually what we have seen on the streets of Iran.
*14:25.800- 14:30.980* :  Women have been pushing boundaries and we are seeing acts of defiance every day
*14:30.980- 14:33.500* :  on the pavements of every city in Iran.
*14:33.500- 14:37.080* :  But that's not what the authorities in the establishments are saying.
*14:37.080- 14:40.120* :  Basically, they have made things more difficult.
*14:40.120- 14:43.740* :  You know, women are being penalized for their dress code.
*14:43.740- 14:47.040* :  They are being beaten and kicked on the pavements.
*14:47.040- 14:50.620* :  Some of the videos that are coming out of Iran are extremely worrying
*14:50.620- 14:56.640* :  because this is a patriarchal society where women generally are victims of domestic violence
*14:56.640- 14:57.940* :  in their own homes.
*14:58.380- 15:02.720* :  And then you are seeing the police force kicking and beating them for their hijab.
*15:03.040- 15:05.880* :  And that kind of normalizes violence against women
*15:06.300- 15:09.120* :  and the clergy and the hardline establishment.
*15:09.140- 15:13.200* :  Keep on saying that women's rights is a red line.
*15:13.200- 15:16.100* :  It's a no-no and they are not going to compromise at all.
*15:16.500- 15:20.200* :  So women are pushing forward and they are fighting
*15:20.200- 15:23.100* :  but we are not really seeing a response that
*15:23.400- 15:27.360* :  shows any kind of silver lining for women's rights at the moment.
*15:27.360- 15:31.940* :  So do we see any women in any position of political power at all in Iran?
*15:32.300- 15:33.660* :  We see them as MPs.
*15:33.660- 15:40.340* :  We have seen one minister, health minister, that was I think two presidents before.
*15:41.020- 15:45.560* :  And we see them at heads of some government-funded organizations
*15:46.440- 15:50.040* :  but not really in decision-making positions
*15:50.040- 15:54.480* :  because even in this system women cannot even be judges.
*15:54.880- 15:58.500* :  So let alone be presidents or decision-makers politically.
*15:59.300- 16:03.020* :  Faranak, Amid the BBC World Service, women's affairs reporter.
*16:06.040- 16:07.980* :  Still to come on the global news podcast,
*16:07.980- 16:13.500* :  she spent four years in prison before being cleared of the murder of a British student in Italy.
*16:13.980- 16:17.940* :  Now Amanda Knox has been convicted of slander by a judge in Florence.
*16:27.920- 16:31.840* :  It's that time of the year. Your vacation is coming up.
*16:32.560- 16:36.340* :  You can already hear the beach waves, feel the warm breeze,
*16:37.320- 16:43.960* :  relax and think about work. You really, really want it all to work out while you're away.

*17:03.000- 17:05.400* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*17:05.720- 17:09.320* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*17:09.320- 17:13.120* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*17:13.380- 17:18.400* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*17:33.200- 17:38.860* :  It was a feud that led Australia's Prime Minister to call Elon Musk an arrogant billionaire.
*17:38.860- 17:44.960* :  The ROW sent it on video footage posted on X of an incident last April when a bishop and
*17:44.960- 17:49.440* :  priest were stabbed in their Sydney church. The authorities tried to get the content removed,
*17:49.440- 17:55.620* :  Mr. Musk refused, and it looks like he's won, with Australia now abandoning that legal effort.
*17:55.620- 18:02.120* :  Our correspondent in Sydney Katie Watson told Paul Moss why Australia's online safety regulator
*18:02.600- 18:04.180* :  had decided not to pursue the case.
*18:04.820- 18:09.680* :  Well, in a statement, she said that the sole goal and focus in issuing the initial removal
*18:09.680- 18:12.960* :  notice was to prevent extremely violent footage from going viral.
*18:13.480- 18:18.820* :  And obviously with the concern of potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm
*18:18.860- 18:24.120* :  on the Australian community. And of course, I mean, we did see this was a stabbing that was live
*18:24.120- 18:30.960* :  streamed and the were riots in the wake of the stabbing as well. So she said, though, that after
*18:30.960- 18:36.060* :  weighing multiple considerations, including litigation across multiple cases, she considered
*18:36.060- 18:41.920* :  this option likely to achieve the most positive outcome for the online safety of all Australians.
*18:41.920- 18:43.440* :  And that's especially children.
*18:43.800- 18:49.400* :  This was very violent footage. I mean, does that mean that X is now free to host whatever graphic
*18:49.400- 18:54.920* :  content it wants to? Not exactly. I mean, even in this statement that the commissioner has put out
*18:55.260- 19:00.800* :  is cited X as CEO as talking to the European Commission in October saying that there are clear
*19:00.800- 19:06.080* :  rules that prohibit violent, hateful entities, perpetrators of violent attacks, violent speech.
*19:06.700- 19:11.120* :  And in fact, the CEO is quoted as saying that we strictly adhere to policies concerning
*19:11.120- 19:16.260* :  illegal content and removing illegal content, including terrorist content from our platform.
*19:16.260- 19:21.280* :  So, you know, they're not free to go and do what they like, but certainly this has caused a huge
*19:21.280- 19:28.100* :  controversy as to, you know, how far what powers regulators have and indeed what exactly is free
*19:28.100- 19:32.800* :  speech. You mentioned the fight that broke out after the stabbing. I mean, this was an incident
*19:32.800- 19:38.640* :  that obviously aroused strong feelings in the community. So, how's the decision being received
*19:38.640- 19:44.160* :  that the footage of it can carry on being displayed? Well, this has been a debate, of course,
*19:44.160- 19:50.500* :  we've heard that Prime Minister Albanese, he called Elon Musk an arrogant out of touch billionaire
*19:51.060- 19:55.820* :  Elon Musk said that this was censorship and you know, that's the debate that's played out.
*19:55.820- 20:02.100* :  Exactly what role and what power does a regulator have to be able to remove content.
*20:02.100- 20:07.240* :  And the sticking point was not just removing it from Australia, but removing it globally because
*20:07.240- 20:12.200* :  of the graphic footage. Or indeed, you know, what rights do people have to be able to access this?
*20:12.200- 20:16.660* :  Of course, it wasn't completely, you know, people were still able to access it through VPNs.
*20:17.020- 20:21.000* :  It wasn't removed totally. So, the debate really about, you know, is this free speech?
*20:21.000- 20:24.580* :  Is this government over control, you know, too much control from the government?
*20:24.580- 20:28.860* :  And that's a debate that we'll carry on. Briefly Katie, what's the legal position? Is that there's
*20:28.860- 20:33.800* :  now further legal proceedings, a review? So, the commissioner has said that she's, you know,
*20:33.800- 20:40.080* :  focusing on a review. There are other litigation issues currently going on with X, but this, you know,
*20:40.240- 20:44.400* :  this is the big news, the fact that it's no longer going to be pursuing the legal battle.
*20:44.840- 20:48.680* :  Everybody's quite interested in that, even though there is a review going on and what,
*20:48.680- 20:53.120* :  what will come out of that review, of course, and as a select committee inquiry into social media,
*20:53.120- 20:56.500* :  and that will be the focus for the commission. Katie Watson in Sydney.
*20:57.300- 21:02.340* :  The authorities in South Korea say North Korea is demolishing sections of a railway
*21:02.340- 21:07.700* :  built to connect the two countries, or details from our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton.
*21:08.340- 21:13.700* :  The inter-Korean railway was heralded as a clear step towards peace between the
*21:13.700- 21:20.260* :  Koreas, when it was unveiled in the year 2000, allowing train travel across their heavily fortified
*21:20.260- 21:27.400* :  border. But since then, relations have deteriorated. Pyongyang has taken steps to eliminate connections
*21:27.400- 21:34.580* :  after declaring several months ago that Korean reunification was no longer a goal. North Korea
*21:34.580- 21:40.320* :  has been developing close ties with Russia, while South Korea has bolstered its relations with
*21:40.320- 21:45.000* :  Japan and the US. Celia Hatton. An American mother, who's son,
*21:45.000- 21:49.180* :  killed himself within six hours, has been targeted by sex torsion scammers,
*21:49.680- 21:54.240* :  is campaigning to raise awareness about how swift and callous these criminals can be.
*21:54.840- 22:00.220* :  Jordan De May died after two Nigerian brothers blackmailed him with explicit images of himself.
*22:00.420- 22:06.720* :  The two men are now awaiting sentencing. Two other Nigerians have been arrested after an Australian
*22:06.720- 22:12.120* :  schoolboy killed himself in April. The head of Nigerian cyber police has told the BBC,
*22:12.120- 22:19.300* :  they go to great lengths to stop sex torsion gangs. Our cyber correspondent Jotide has this investigation.
*22:20.140- 22:23.860* :  Jordan was targeted by a sex torsion gang. They messaged him on Instagram,
*22:23.860- 22:29.360* :  pretending to be a girl, his age, and coaxed him into sending explicit images. They then
*22:29.360- 22:34.260* :  blackmailed him, demanding money in exchange for not sharing the pictures. Jordan sent some,
*22:34.260- 22:39.120* :  but it wasn't enough. I was less than six hours from the time that Jordan started
*22:39.120- 22:46.640* :  communicating until the time he ultimately took his life. There's actually like a script online,
*22:46.760- 22:51.560* :  and these people are just going through the script and putting that pressure on,
*22:51.880- 22:55.560* :  and they're doing it quick because then they can move on to the next person because it's about
*22:55.560- 23:01.560* :  volume. Since Jordan died, Jen Boota has become an active campaigner, raising awareness about
*23:01.560- 23:06.120* :  sex torsion to young people and parents. But if you haven't talked to your children about
*23:06.120- 23:13.120* :  sex torsion and what happens, go get them right now, immediately sit them down, talk to them.
*23:13.740- 23:18.040* :  On TikTok, her videos have now had more than a million likes. I get messages all the time
*23:18.040- 23:24.320* :  from parents reaching out asking what to do. US crime figures show sex torsion cases more than
*23:24.320- 23:31.060* :  doubled last year, rising to 26,700. In the US alone, at least 27 boys killed themselves
*23:31.060- 23:37.020* :  in the last two years. In the UK last month, police put out a warning to schools and young people.
*23:37.860- 23:41.880* :  What happened to Jordan in Marquette here in the north of the US has become a focal point in
*23:41.880- 23:46.680* :  the ongoing discussions about how to solve sex torsion. It's a growing global problem with victims
*23:46.680- 23:51.640* :  all over the world, but there's one country where a disproportionate number of these cyber criminals
*23:51.640- 23:57.860* :  seems to be based. According to researchers, a large number of scammers come from West Africa,
*23:58.520- 24:04.880* :  specifically Nigeria. Two brothers from Lagos admitted to targeting Jordan. Samuel O'Goshi,
*24:04.880- 24:10.760* :  who's 22, and Samson O'Goshi, who's 20, were extradited to the US and are awaiting sentencing.
*24:12.000- 24:16.840* :  Message records show the criminals were callous when Jordan told them he might kill himself
*24:16.840- 24:21.900* :  if they release the pictures. They replied, do that fast or I'll make you do it.
*24:23.000- 24:27.980* :  Two other Nigerians were arrested in April linked to the suicide of an Australian schoolboy.
*24:28.600- 24:32.920* :  Nigerian authorities have long been accused of not doing enough, but in the last year they've
*24:32.920- 24:36.840* :  been rounding up young men and arresting them for what's described as internet fraud.
*24:39.480- 24:44.200* :  Last year Nigeria's cyber crime police published a dramatic promotional video of their activity.
*24:44.560- 24:49.400* :  Hey, what a tough husband, huh? Showing police raiding cyber gangs with guns.
*24:51.920- 24:56.660* :  Head of the division, director Ifei Anyi Henry, defends his forces action to stop the criminals.
*24:57.720- 25:03.020* :  People that believe that Nigeria is not in a, I know, is laughable. I use all laughable because
*25:03.720- 25:10.120* :  the government of Nigeria spends billions of narrative to provide to establish a national
*25:10.120- 25:15.000* :  cyber crime center like this. The walk is actually wrong going. We are not taking
*25:15.000- 25:19.540* :  it's, you know, things for granted, we're going to add to anything concerning the extortionment
*25:19.540- 25:25.020* :  in particular. And they know this and we're giving them very serious hits. A lot have been
*25:25.020- 25:30.320* :  prosecuted, a lot have been arrested. The police say other gangs in Southeast Asia are also to blame
*25:30.320- 25:36.420* :  and that Nigerian teens are being targeted too. But cyber experts like Dr. Robinson Tumbari from
*25:36.420- 25:42.060* :  digital footprints in Nigeria worry that extortion and other cyber fraud has become normalized
*25:42.060- 25:48.500* :  to Nigeria's large young tech savvy population. The main triggers is actually socio-economic
*25:48.500- 25:55.020* :  in nature. So, you know, it's become almost like a mainstream activities where they don't really
*25:55.020- 26:00.920* :  think too much about the consequences but just going all the same because, you know, a colleague is
*26:00.920- 26:03.860* :  going in and, you know, making money on all of that.
*26:08.340- 26:13.620* :  Meanwhile in Michigan, Jen continues her campaign in memory of her son who couldn't be there
*26:13.620- 26:22.180* :  to collect his high school honors. Our cyber correspondent Joe Tidy, it was a brutal killing
*26:22.180- 26:27.440* :  that shocked the world. In 2007, British student Meredith Kircher was stabbed to death in her
*26:27.440- 26:33.560* :  apartment in the Italian city of Perugia. Her flatmate, American Amanda Knox, spent four years
*26:33.560- 26:40.220* :  in prison for the murder before finally being cleared in 2015. Now, a judge in a court in Florence
*26:40.220- 26:46.980* :  has convicted Amanda Knox of slander. Our reporter in Rome, David A. Guilione, gave us this update.
*26:47.820- 26:54.300* :  We were just listening to Amanda Knox's lawyers who came out straight after the judge read the
*26:54.320- 26:59.840* :  verdict and they said that the client Amanda Knox was extremely disappointed because she was
*26:59.840- 27:05.320* :  hoping to clear her name once and for all. Obviously, this trial was not about the murder because she's
*27:05.320- 27:12.220* :  been acquitted. She was acquitted for that in 2015 but the slander trial was now taking place in
*27:12.220- 27:16.780* :  Florence after she was previously accused and then there was a retrial. So, it's all very legally
*27:16.780- 27:23.900* :  complicated. This legal battle started back in 2007 when a British student Meredith Kircher
*27:24.380- 27:31.780* :  was murdered and she was Amanda Knox's flatmate. Then Amanda Knox was accused and convicted,
*27:31.780- 27:37.260* :  found guilty first of the murder, then she was acquitted, then she was found guilty again,
*27:37.260- 27:43.080* :  then she was acquitted once and for all for the murder in 2015. Now, this is a separate trial
*27:43.520- 27:50.680* :  for the slander because when she was interrogated four days after murder, she accused another man
*27:50.840- 27:58.340* :  who was not involved of the murder of Kircher and she wrote his name on a piece of paper. Today,
*27:58.340- 28:06.360* :  during the trial, she read a spontaneous statement in Italy and where she basically accused Italian
*28:06.360- 28:14.580* :  police back in the day of treating her badly. She said she was confused and she said that was the
*28:14.580- 28:21.240* :  worst night of her entire life and she was hoping to, you know, be acquitted obviously. Now,
*28:21.240- 28:26.660* :  a lawyer has said that there will wait for the motivation for the sentence which will be published
*28:26.660- 28:32.900* :  within the next 60 days and there will probably appear. David Aguilione in Rome.
*28:33.780- 28:38.820* :  Commemorations to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings have begun in Britain and
*28:38.820- 28:44.880* :  France. King Charles and the US President Joe Biden will join around 200 World War II veterans
*28:44.880- 28:50.540* :  in northern France tomorrow, the 6th of June to mark the Allied assault on the Normandy beaches.
*28:51.180- 28:56.220* :  It was the largest seaborn invasion in history and played a big part in the Allied victory over
*28:56.220- 29:01.900* :  the Nazis. As well as those who fought on the beaches, there were others, particularly women who
*29:01.900- 29:09.700* :  helped with the war effort elsewhere. We heard from two of them. My name is Patricia Davis. Used to
*29:09.700- 29:17.260* :  be Patricia Ultramen during the war, when I was in the Women's Royal Naval Service because I
*29:17.260- 29:24.680* :  knew German. I was in a branch where we did a lot of secret work. My name is Christian Lamb.
*29:24.820- 29:32.460* :  I was a third officer in the Reds. I had an interesting job making maps for the invasion.
*29:32.860- 29:42.900* :  At the time of D-Day, I was 20 and I'm now just coming up in June to my 100th and first birthday
*29:43.980- 29:50.780* :  which seems over the top. When I was in 23, when I was working on the maps of D-Day,
*29:50.780- 29:59.780* :  I'm now 103. We collected the codes because we listened to the German broadcasts,
*30:00.140- 30:07.520* :  but we sent them on immediately to Blestry Park. I hoped to do the best I could by getting these
*30:07.520- 30:14.240* :  particular detailed maps for the places where the soldiers were going to land.
*30:16.620- 30:23.760* :  On the 6th of June 1944, the Great Secret is devoured. I think one morning I was sitting
*30:23.760- 30:31.280* :  reading and I saw a little party of people coming up. To my greatest astonishment, I recognised
*30:32.080- 30:40.220* :  the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill wanted to be seen looking at the
*30:40.220- 30:46.220* :  coast now at Calais to give an impression that that's where the landings were going to be,
*30:46.780- 30:54.120* :  when they were going to be 40 miles to the west down in Normandy and apparently he was seen
*30:54.120- 31:00.800* :  and that was reported and the Germans did hear about it. So it was a tiny bit of history.
*31:01.360- 31:06.100* :  It's interesting to reflect how the word invasion has swung around to mean something gratifying
*31:06.340- 31:13.440* :  to Britain. You could feel the atmosphere growing and growing and growing and you knew
*31:13.440- 31:21.040* :  that something enormously bright and splendid was about to take place, but you didn't know when.
*31:21.360- 31:28.580* :  Supreme Headquarters, L.R. Expeditionary Force, have just issued Communicate No. 1 and in a few
*31:28.580- 31:34.340* :  seconds I will read it to you. And so of course for the very morning when I turned on the radio at
*31:34.340- 31:43.060* :  5 in the morning or something like that and heard that they had started. Go was the word and it
*31:43.060- 31:49.920* :  was a most amazingly thrilling moment of my life. Under the command of General Eisenhower,
*31:50.540- 31:57.480* :  Allied naval forces supported by strong air forces began landing Allied armies this morning
*31:57.540- 32:04.040* :  on the northern coast of France. D-Day is probably the most important day. It may not be
*32:04.480- 32:11.440* :  with many people of this generation have ever heard about it or if they have they don't need much
*32:11.900- 32:20.760* :  to them. Even having quite a minor view of it we did have a small part to play in D-Day. I hope
*32:21.140- 32:29.240* :  D-Day goes on being remembered and the children's ticklet are told about the significance of it
*32:29.800- 32:40.140* :  because it was important. The voices of Patricia Davis and Christian Lamb
*32:40.140- 32:48.280* :  sharing their experiences of D-Day. And that is all from us for now but the Global News podcast
*32:48.280- 32:53.020* :  will be back very soon. This edition was mixed by James Piper and produced by Oliver Burlow,
*32:53.020- 32:56.900* :  our editors Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
