*01:25.820- 01:28.120* :  the 26th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:28.680- 01:31.100* :  The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange,
*01:31.100- 01:34.880* :  has arrived home in Australia after being freed by a US court
*01:35.240- 01:37.280* :  in a remote Pacific Ocean territory.
*01:37.920- 01:40.520* :  The espionage trial of the American journalist,
*01:41.000- 01:43.400* :  Evan Gershkovic, has begun in Russia.
*01:44.080- 01:47.980* :  A former islamist rebel from Marley has been found guilty of war crimes
*01:48.020- 01:51.440* :  and crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.
*01:53.620- 01:54.540* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:54.540- 01:57.520* :  The extremes are very dangerous.
*01:58.000- 02:01.000* :  Once they are in the power, they are there to stay.
*02:01.340- 02:05.260* :  They will change things so that we won't be able to get them out.
*02:05.880- 02:09.440* :  I start warning about the perceived risks of the far right,
*02:09.760- 02:11.620* :  winning the upcoming French election.
*02:14.860- 02:17.800* :  The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange,
*02:17.920- 02:22.840* :  is back on Australian soil at the end of a 14-year long legal battle
*02:22.840- 02:25.780* :  over the release of classified US defense documents.
*02:26.420- 02:29.040* :  Our correspondent Katie Watson was at Canberra Airport
*02:29.040- 02:30.340* :  when he stepped off the plane.
*02:30.940- 02:33.820* :  He's finally made it onto Australian soil.
*02:35.120- 02:40.300* :  He's there waving to the media and to the supporters who come here
*02:40.800- 02:43.340* :  to see him land on Australian soil.
*02:43.340- 02:44.380* :  This is a big moment.
*02:45.860- 02:47.140* :  Three cheers for Julian.
*02:50.240- 02:55.440* :  He's waving to everybody here as he walks into the airport building.
*02:55.980- 02:58.100* :  Of course, he's here, his family will be here.
*02:58.100- 03:00.000* :  It looks like he's heading in.
*03:00.940- 03:05.820* :  His family who've come to see him, his father, his wife, who've come to the airport.
*03:09.640- 03:12.540* :  This is a moment where so many people just did not think
*03:13.180- 03:14.780* :  would ever happen.
*03:14.780- 03:20.040* :  And finally, he is here for his supporters, for the government who've
*03:20.040- 03:21.420* :  lobbied so hard to see him.
*03:23.220- 03:26.780* :  And he's now given a big hug to his wife, Stella.
*03:28.300- 03:33.440* :  What Stella Assange flanked by fellow lawyers later spoke to the awaiting press.
*03:34.280- 03:38.500* :  Julian wanted me to sincerely thank everyone.
*03:39.320- 03:42.380* :  He wanted to be here, but you have to understand
*03:43.740- 03:44.580* :  what he's been through.
*03:45.440- 03:46.160* :  He needs time.
*03:47.160- 03:48.440* :  He needs to recuperate.
*03:50.440- 03:55.700* :  And this is a process I ask you please to give us space.
*03:56.640- 04:01.680* :  Before being allowed to return to Australia, Mr Assange had pleaded guilty to one count
*04:01.680- 04:07.440* :  of conspiracy in a court from on a small Pacific island administered by the United States.
*04:08.060- 04:11.940* :  Washington had been deeply embarrassed and angry about Mr Assange
*04:12.340- 04:17.320* :  for disseminating classified documents showing the American military in a bad light in Iraq
*04:17.480- 04:18.200* :  and Afghanistan.
*04:18.960- 04:22.740* :  A correspondent Jonathan Head was in court on the island of Saipan
*04:23.140- 04:26.660* :  and James Coppano asked him how Mr Assange appeared to be doing.
*04:27.140- 04:31.960* :  Well, he seemed sort of quite downbeat, calm, serious.
*04:32.200- 04:36.420* :  You know, he read along to all the prosecution documents when they were being detailed,
*04:36.420- 04:37.600* :  the charges against him.
*04:38.180- 04:39.380* :  He was didn't say a lot.
*04:39.440- 04:44.080* :  I mean, mostly he was asked by the judge repeatedly if he understood the implications of the
*04:44.080- 04:46.840* :  deal that he'd done with the US that the rights he'd waived.
*04:46.840- 04:49.200* :  He simply said yes to all of those very sharply and quickly.
*04:49.560- 04:51.520* :  There's no doubt in his mind that the deal stuck.
*04:52.140- 04:54.460* :  There was only one point at which he defended what he'd done.
*04:54.460- 04:59.340* :  He explained that when he had leaked the documents, he believed he was covered
*04:59.340- 05:03.720* :  by the First Amendment of the US Constitution and that in fact that he says that conflicts
*05:04.340- 05:05.700* :  with the law under which he's been charged.
*05:05.820- 05:11.080* :  He thinks that's a problem, but he did accept that the law as it stands, he'd broken it.
*05:11.340- 05:16.860* :  There was this kind of tacit deal, the prosecution for their part detailed just how much interaction
*05:16.860- 05:22.580* :  there had been between Mr Assange and former US soldier Chelsea Manning and how much damage
*05:22.580- 05:24.400* :  that could do to national security.
*05:24.400- 05:29.880* :  So each side kind of stayed on its own line, but they also clearly how well completely
*05:29.880- 05:33.840* :  comfortable with the idea of a deal and the judge accepted that once she, but she was very
*05:33.840- 05:38.000* :  meticulous. She spent about two hours going over all the details of the deal before she was
*05:38.000- 05:41.120* :  comfortable that she understood it and that both sides understood it.
*05:41.380- 05:45.080* :  It all relaxed at the very end when she made him stand up to hear the sentence.
*05:45.080- 05:48.760* :  The sentence was basically said, you've done 62 months in a British prison.
*05:49.160- 05:51.000* :  That's as much as I would give you anyway.
*05:51.000- 05:52.680* :  So you walk free out of here, free man.
*05:53.140- 05:57.200* :  And then at the end she wished him an early happy birthday and said a happy start to your new life.
*05:58.420- 06:02.220* :  It has been an extraordinary saga really over, well over a decade,
*06:02.220- 06:05.920* :  bringing in numerous charges, numerous countries.
*06:07.340- 06:11.220* :  Big issues too about freedom of speech versus national security.
*06:12.220- 06:14.360* :  I think that's the one that won't be resolved.
*06:14.600- 06:17.700* :  And it'll be interesting to see what Julian Assange does now.
*06:17.700- 06:18.740* :  He's gone back to Australia.
*06:18.740- 06:22.720* :  And I was going to spend a lot of time with his loved ones and I love thinking to do,
*06:22.720- 06:25.600* :  but what he stood for is still just as divisive.
*06:25.600- 06:28.120* :  As indeed is the deal that he struck with the US government.
*06:28.120- 06:30.860* :  It's been criticized by former Vice President Mike Pence.
*06:31.320- 06:34.800* :  Because there are a lot of people who believe Julian Assange was reckless
*06:35.420- 06:40.320* :  with the well-being of US soldiers who were exposed in WikiLeaks with national security.
*06:40.320- 06:41.600* :  And we'll never forgive him for that.
*06:41.840- 06:45.840* :  There are others who so strongly believe that what he's doing is right and necessary.
*06:46.160- 06:50.280* :  And remember, some of the things he exposed were awful things the US military did and covered up.
*06:50.280- 06:53.160* :  So you could definitely argue there was a public interest.
*06:53.600- 06:56.440* :  That divide still stands and it won't go away.
*06:56.860- 06:58.880* :  It almost reflects the world we live in.
*06:58.880- 07:01.620* :  People have taken very strong sides on Julian Assange.
*07:01.980- 07:03.580* :  He's an extremely divisive figure.
*07:04.520- 07:08.960* :  I'm curious as others may be too about the island where this is all taking place.
*07:09.080- 07:10.300* :  Why there? What's it like?
*07:12.840- 07:17.440* :  Well, it is the most incongruous place to see an ending to this saga.
*07:17.680- 07:19.160* :  You would never have expected it.
*07:19.400- 07:20.820* :  When I've been to Saipad once before,
*07:20.820- 07:23.840* :  I mean, it's a beautiful tropical island but very, very remote.
*07:23.840- 07:25.200* :  It's right out in the middle of Pacific.
*07:25.740- 07:30.520* :  I mean, did suffer terrible fighting during the Second World War between the US and Japanese troops.
*07:31.060- 07:33.080* :  But since then, it's become essentially a mecha for
*07:33.620- 07:35.820* :  Korean and Chinese and Japanese honeymooners.
*07:36.620- 07:38.960* :  Palm trees, warm tropical breezes.
*07:39.620- 07:41.220* :  Everyone wears bright flowery shirts.
*07:41.840- 07:44.940* :  It was very odd to see this story finished here.
*07:44.940- 07:46.920* :  But there are reasons for that.
*07:47.020- 07:53.580* :  It's the most convenient place for Julian Assange to stop on his way back to Australia.
*07:54.100- 07:56.860* :  But I think he also was determined not to go to the mainland US
*07:56.860- 07:58.760* :  to stay as far away from Washington as possible.
*07:59.120- 08:02.820* :  If this is part of a, it has a Commonwealth status with the United States.
*08:02.820- 08:04.140* :  It is technically US territory.
*08:04.140- 08:09.260* :  But it's about as far away as you can get from the sort of centers of US power
*08:09.580- 08:11.480* :  while still being under the jurisdiction of its courts.
*08:11.480- 08:12.760* :  And I think that's why it was chosen.
*08:13.340- 08:16.340* :  Jonathan Head, and if you want to hear more about that deal
*08:16.820- 08:19.220* :  that led to the freeing of Julian Assange,
*08:19.700- 08:23.420* :  listen to the global story available wherever you find your BBC
*08:24.280- 08:24.300* :  podcasts.
*08:25.780- 08:30.400* :  Well, as Julian Assange comes to the end of the legal process by pleading guilty,
*08:31.080- 08:36.180* :  the American journalist Evan Gershkovich has begun his spying trial in Russia.
*08:36.720- 08:38.380* :  He strongly denies the charges.
*08:38.380- 08:42.680* :  The Wall Street Journal reporter is in court in Yekaterinburg,
*08:42.680- 08:45.000* :  1,500 kilometers east of Moscow.
*08:45.560- 08:47.920* :  A Russia editor Steve Rosenberg is there.
*08:48.540- 08:50.040* :  Just before the start of the trial,
*08:50.600- 08:53.600* :  media were allowed into a courtroom to see him.
*08:54.340- 08:58.660* :  He was standing in this sort of glass and metal cage that's known as the Aquarium
*08:59.100- 09:00.000* :  in Russian courtrooms.
*09:00.300- 09:01.000* :  His head was shaving.
*09:01.740- 09:04.140* :  He was wearing our check shirts and jeans.
*09:04.780- 09:06.580* :  And he was smiling at the cameras.
*09:06.580- 09:08.440* :  He looked in good physical shape.
*09:08.440- 09:13.380* :  But obviously he's been behind bars for nearly 15 months now in Moscow.
*09:13.980- 09:16.320* :  He's been brought to Yekaterinburg for the trial.
*09:16.920- 09:19.280* :  And the trial will take place behind closed doors.
*09:19.320- 09:22.240* :  And that means that no family members will be allowed in.
*09:22.820- 09:24.700* :  No US diplomats will be allowed in.
*09:25.100- 09:26.380* :  The media won't be allowed in.
*09:26.860- 09:31.020* :  So that adds extra, I think, psychological pressure onto Evan Gershkovich.
*09:31.980- 09:33.840* :  And what's he specifically accused of?
*09:34.780- 09:39.380* :  So officially Russian prosecutors have accused him of espionage.
*09:39.380- 09:43.260* :  They claim that he had been collecting classified information
*09:43.800- 09:47.520* :  about a Russian defense enterprise, a Russian tank manufacturer,
*09:48.180- 09:50.120* :  about 100 miles from Yekaterinburg.
*09:50.400- 09:53.740* :  Now Mr. Gershkovich, his employer, the Wall Street Journal,
*09:54.720- 09:57.800* :  and the US government say that is absolutely not the case.
*09:57.800- 10:01.560* :  They vehemently reject these accusations and these charges.
*10:01.560- 10:06.560* :  And the Wall Street Journal has called this a sham trial, a bogus process,
*10:07.200- 10:09.700* :  which they expect to end in a conviction.
*10:10.260- 10:14.020* :  Now, Steve, there's a recent history of Washington and Russia doing legal deals.
*10:14.020- 10:17.620* :  What kind of likelihood is there of some kind of deal this time?
*10:18.000- 10:20.240* :  There has to be an expectation, I think.
*10:20.240- 10:22.720* :  The thing is that the Russians know perfectly well,
*10:22.720- 10:28.200* :  that when it comes to America trying to get its citizens back from foreign jails,
*10:28.680- 10:30.460* :  Washington is prepared to do deals.
*10:31.000- 10:33.520* :  We saw that, for example, at the end of 2022,
*10:34.380- 10:38.880* :  when Washington agreed to release a convicted Russian arms dealer,
*10:38.880- 10:42.260* :  Victor Boot, in order to secure the release from a Russian jail
*10:42.760- 10:45.300* :  of US basketball star Brittany Griner,
*10:45.840- 10:48.120* :  who had been in a Russian jail on drugs charges.
*10:48.840- 10:53.680* :  So we know that contacts have been made between the US and Russia over
*10:53.680- 10:56.400* :  Evan Gershkovich. We don't know what stage they're at,
*10:56.920- 11:00.080* :  but I think certainly the Wall Street Journal is hoping that at some point
*11:00.080- 11:05.060* :  there could be some prisoner swap and President Putin himself has said
*11:05.540- 11:08.620* :  that he would be open to a prisoner exchange.
*11:09.060- 11:11.820* :  Now, that raises the question, if they release Evan,
*11:11.820- 11:13.560* :  who do the Russians want in return?
*11:14.260- 11:17.900* :  And although the Kremlin leader hasn't named names specifically,
*11:18.460- 11:22.020* :  he has dropped a very strong hint that the man that Russia wants to see
*11:22.680- 11:26.240* :  released from a Western jail is Vadim Krasikov.
*11:26.520- 11:31.560* :  This is a man who's believed to be a Russian agent who's currently serving a life sentence
*11:31.560- 11:34.640* :  in Germany for murder. Steve Rosenberg.
*11:35.560- 11:39.580* :  The International Criminal Court in the Hague has convicted a former
*11:39.580- 11:43.160* :  Islamist rebel of committing war crimes in Marley.
*11:43.620- 11:48.620* :  Al-Hassan Mahmoud was part of a group linked to Al-Qaeda that sees control of the city.
*11:49.180- 11:52.540* :  Its members flogged residents, destroyed ancient shrines,
*11:52.540- 11:55.580* :  and forced hundreds of women into sexual slavery.
*11:56.240- 11:59.520* :  Our correspondent Anna Holligan spoke to me from outside the court.
*12:00.240- 12:04.500* :  Well, it took the judge around two hours to read out just a summary of the judgment such
*12:04.740- 12:07.760* :  was the scale of the atrocities committed during this period.
*12:07.760- 12:12.500* :  But what's been really interesting during this whole trial is the focus of the prosecution
*12:12.620- 12:17.720* :  on gender-based persecution. The previous prosecutor wanted to make this really
*12:18.320- 12:22.580* :  stand out and draw attention to the fact that women and girls are so often the hidden victims
*12:22.580- 12:28.580* :  in conflict. And yet what we have here in this judgment, the judges have found that
*12:28.580- 12:35.740* :  Mr. Al-Hassan was guilty by majority, so the majority of judges, rather than unanimous,
*12:36.080- 12:41.360* :  of directing crimes, contributing to them, aging and abesting the commission of crimes by others.
*12:41.360- 12:49.020* :  In relation to crimes against humanity of torture, outroages upon personal dignity and cruel
*12:49.020- 12:56.520* :  treatment and passing of sentences without proper judicial guarantees and other inhumane acts
*12:56.540- 13:02.060* :  and mutilation. However, they found that there wasn't enough evidence to tie him
*13:02.440- 13:09.240* :  to the extensive sexual crimes committed against women and girls in Marley during this period in
*13:09.240- 13:16.200* :  Timbuktu, specifically. So the judges said there were many instances of rape and sexual slavery
*13:17.240- 13:25.060* :  and women and girls being forced into marriages. But he was acquitted of those charges and also
*13:25.060- 13:32.540* :  acquitted of the war crime of attacking protected objects because of course these crimes took place
*13:32.540- 13:39.620* :  in the historic city of Timbuktu and during that period the Islamist rebels attacked sacred
*13:39.620- 13:44.760* :  tombs and mausoleums, but he was cleared of being involved in those atrocities.
*13:45.180- 13:51.240* :  Interesting. So he not convicted of those specifically gender related issues, gender persecution,
*13:51.240- 13:57.800* :  but it's pretty unusual, isn't it, for those kind of issues to be raised at the ICC anyway?
*13:59.300- 14:05.340* :  Usually so and I think this will be a big disappointment actually for the prosecution because
*14:05.800- 14:13.040* :  they were quite determined to try to highlight the specific gender-based persecution that women
*14:13.040- 14:19.260* :  and girls are often subjected to and insofar as he has been cleared of those atrocities they have
*14:19.260- 14:24.700* :  failed to bring sufficient evidence in this case, but it's put it on the map so it's something
*14:24.700- 14:30.760* :  that we expect to see in future trials here at the ICC. Anaholican, as we record this podcast
*14:30.760- 14:35.120* :  there are just four days to go before the first round of the French Parliamentary elections.
*14:35.940- 14:40.320* :  Paul suggests the extreme right-wing national rally party is likely to win the largest
*14:40.320- 14:45.060* :  number of seats and could form the next government for the first time. There's one veteran
*14:45.060- 14:49.480* :  political commentator told the BBC's Hugh Scofield we are jumping into the unknown.
*14:50.340- 14:55.800* :  Hugh has been in the thin, a man department south of Paris for where he sent this report.
*14:59.640- 15:05.660* :  What could be finer than music on a hot summer's day in a historic town square in provincial France?
*15:05.740- 15:12.360* :  This is Fountain Blow, home once to the Emperor Napoleon. Today it's natural macro-enteradry,
*15:12.660- 15:17.980* :  like the man it's prosperous, international, and since two weeks ago, deeply worried.
*15:18.580- 15:25.620* :  I am Juliette Villegrin. I've come to see the woman who till the assembly was so unexpectedly
*15:25.620- 15:31.800* :  dissolved was the local MP. Today she's campaigning again for the Macronite Centre,
*15:32.200- 15:40.240* :  and with a simple message, keep out the extremes. The extremes are very dangerous. The right-wing,
*15:40.240- 15:46.800* :  the ahead, once they are in the power, they are there to stay. They will change things so that
*15:46.800- 15:53.820* :  we won't be able to get them out. And of course, right now they tell you what you want to hear.
*15:54.360- 16:02.480* :  In reality, those propositions are not possible. So, what are the risks, I believe, that for all
*16:02.480- 16:08.800* :  their efforts, though, the Macronite Centre in France is not holding. Things are falling apart.
*16:08.860- 16:14.440* :  The far-right could win in two weeks, or there'll be political paralysis. And for the veteran
*16:14.440- 16:20.720* :  commentator, Nicola Bavare, either possibility presents risks at that crisis, social unrest,
*16:20.720- 16:28.160* :  political collapse. Really a situation where you may have a brutal breakup of the institutions.
*16:32.700- 16:35.580* :  And there was another word on President Macron's lips this week,
*16:35.580- 16:40.680* :  Garciville, civil war. Civil war is a word that Macron mentioned.
*16:40.800- 16:50.280* :  Yes, and I think that it's very dangerous because the fact for him to use this word and to try
*16:50.280- 16:57.600* :  to save his power, in fact, on fear, this is very dangerous because you know that in a democracy,
*16:58.480- 17:07.200* :  when you play on fears, then you have hate and then violence. So, this dynamic is one of the most
*17:07.200- 17:12.220* :  dangerous for a democratic country. So, what you're saying is that when President Macron talks
*17:12.220- 17:19.040* :  about civil war, even as a theoretical possibility, he makes it more possible. Yes, of course.
*17:26.480- 17:30.920* :  Alarmist, it certainly feels it out here in the southern part of the Fontainebleau
*17:30.920- 17:37.080* :  constituency, where the piece of the deep French countryside seems to mock the scary talk of the
*17:37.080- 17:43.460* :  towns. But this is prime national rally turf. I am not hurt when I see a Muslim who
*17:44.500- 17:49.740* :  yarn candidate is Ivanka Dimitrova, Bulgarian by birth, so an immigrant herself,
*17:49.740- 17:55.240* :  but a woman who feels a profound cultural attachment to France and a fear that its
*17:55.240- 18:00.860* :  distinctiveness is under threat from uncontrolled immigration. People who come here, she says,
*18:01.300- 18:08.240* :  cannot expect to rule the roost. The dominating one must stay dominating. Are you a dangerous party?
*18:09.200- 18:15.540* :  No, I don't think so. No, no, no. Certainly not. Are you an extremist party?
*18:16.080- 18:22.440* :  I know. I don't see anything extreme. When you have your family and someone is
*18:23.900- 18:30.640* :  doing harm to the members of your family, you want to protect them. Are you extremist with this?
*18:31.100- 18:36.760* :  No, our families, France, we want to protect our family. That's all.
*18:37.180- 18:41.760* :  That report was by Huesco Field. Still to come.
*18:45.180- 18:50.240* :  Let's go, girl. I'm a little overwhelmed. I mean, from the minute it was even a possibility,
*18:51.220- 18:56.560* :  I had to keep it a secret. Guess who's taking the legend spot at this year's Glastonbury Festival.
*19:03.040- 19:05.200* :  As the war rages on between...
*19:07.940- 19:12.320* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies
*19:12.320- 19:17.160* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*19:17.160- 19:21.840* :  prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you
*19:21.840- 19:26.800* :  talking about? You insane Hollywood ****. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*19:26.800- 19:32.240* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash Switch.

*19:38.500- 19:43.180* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*19:43.460- 19:47.960* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce that
*19:47.960- 19:53.560* :  be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*19:53.820- 19:58.840* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*20:11.200- 20:16.400* :  Russia and Ukraine, neighboring countries are thinking carefully about how to prepare for
*20:16.400- 20:21.840* :  possible conflict. We reported earlier this year that in Finland, which shares a border with Russia,
*20:21.840- 20:27.620* :  the government is opening 300 new shooting ranges to help citizens test their aim.
*20:27.620- 20:34.140* :  And now Poland is launching a holiday with the Army program, allowing young people to pick up
*20:34.140- 20:40.160* :  some of the basics for battle. The Polish Foreign Minister, Radik Sikorski, has been telling us
*20:40.160- 20:46.660* :  how the scheme will work. Countries have digital reserves, people who are willing to sit at home
*20:47.560- 20:54.300* :  in front of their computers and to repel those DDoS attacks. You actually need a lot of people
*20:54.300- 21:00.740* :  to help with that. But also, our young people should get out in the woods and know the basics of
*21:00.740- 21:05.900* :  medical assistance, of weapons handling. It should be good for them, it should be good for the country
*21:05.900- 21:11.720* :  and also good for their future employment prospects. When I was a young man, we had a voluntary
*21:11.720- 21:19.800* :  service like that. It involved getting a glider license, which of course, the military then treated
*21:19.800- 21:25.620* :  as a pool of recruits for fighter pilots. And maybe some of these young people find that they like
*21:25.640- 21:29.320* :  it and maybe they'll volunteer for the Army proper. That will be excellent.
*21:30.140- 21:35.440* :  Well, Israel, too, is struggling with recruiting young people to fight in the ongoing war in Gaza.
*21:36.040- 21:41.100* :  As we reported yesterday, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that ultra-orthodox Jewish men
*21:41.580- 21:47.900* :  must be drafted into military service, ending a long-standing exemption. This decision could be
*21:47.900- 21:52.640* :  politically explosive, though, especially as Mr Netanyahu struggles to hold together
*21:52.640- 21:59.460* :  a right-wing coalition that includes two ultra-orthodox parties. Victoria Oon Kunda spoke to
*21:59.460- 22:05.620* :  Orthodox Rabbi Pysac Friedman from Jerusalem about the reaction of the Orthodox community
*22:05.620- 22:11.280* :  to the Supreme Court's decision. Jewish men have tremendous respect and appreciation for the
*22:11.280- 22:17.300* :  soldiers in the Israeli's defense forces, always and especially at this time of war. But for 76
*22:17.300- 22:25.480* :  years, there's been a recognition that the students studying Torah, which is the core of Jewish
*22:25.480- 22:31.360* :  tradition, play an important role in preserving Judaism's tradition. Israel is obviously a Jewish
*22:31.500- 22:36.220* :  state and there's always been a respect and recognition of that. So what impact then do you think
*22:36.220- 22:42.640* :  this mandatory military conscription is going to have on that tradition, on the religion,
*22:42.640- 22:49.840* :  and the standing that has been for as you said for 76 years? Like you mentioned, it's politically
*22:49.840- 22:55.320* :  explosive. It's really a political football and we're quite convinced that no Yashiva students
*22:55.320- 23:01.140* :  are going to be dragged out of his Yashiva studies to be taken to the military and the military
*23:01.140- 23:07.840* :  doesn't truly need those students. 41 percent of the Israeli public supports the continued
*23:07.840- 23:14.640* :  deferment of Torah students from the draft and it's going to continue. It's going to make
*23:15.020- 23:20.620* :  trouble politically for Netanyahu. If anybody in the coalition, even Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu
*23:20.620- 23:24.860* :  himself while listening to us now, what message would you like to put forward?
*23:26.540- 23:32.020* :  I'd like to put forward that Israel right now is in a situation of actually existential threat war
*23:32.020- 23:40.160* :  on several fronts and this is not the time to start making societal upheaval and divisiveness
*23:40.160- 23:47.040* :  in the Jewish people and we should preserve our unity rather than then bringing up topics like
*23:47.040- 23:52.740* :  this at this perilous time. You did mention that you have some support, I believe you said 41 percent,
*23:52.740- 23:58.040* :  but some might say that is not quite a lot considering that there is 59 percent of my just think,
*23:58.040- 24:04.160* :  well why can they just join in coming and help fight those existential threats that you mentioned?
*24:06.360- 24:11.520* :  41 percent is not the majority, but it's getting rather close. The ultra-orthodox, as they're
*24:11.660- 24:18.000* :  are really only something like 10 to 12 percent of the public, but a very large plurality supports it,
*24:18.060- 24:22.680* :  but furthermore, the religious community actually has the highest levels of volunteerism.
*24:22.900- 24:28.500* :  Every area of life, whether it be in the hospitals or you may have seen religious Jews collecting,
*24:28.500- 24:35.100* :  unfortunately, the dead bodies of terror victims after October 7th or even changing a flat tire,
*24:35.100- 24:39.680* :  it's the religious community that provides those services as a tradition of volunteering,
*24:40.320- 24:45.660* :  but here the court wants to come and intervene actually in our way of life, in our tradition,
*24:45.660- 24:51.520* :  in the ages at which tourist students generally in the rabbinical schools and we're not going to allow
*24:51.520- 24:58.300* :  that to happen. Rabbi Pysac Friedman there, the United Nations office on drugs and crime has warned
*24:58.300- 25:05.140* :  that new highly potent synthetic drugs known as nitazines have led to an increase in overdose deaths
*25:05.140- 25:11.620* :  in several countries, Bethany Bell reports. The UNADC report said nitazines, which are synthetic
*25:11.620- 25:18.520* :  opioids, were posing lethal risks. It said that in some cases, nitazines were more potent than
*25:18.520- 25:25.460* :  fentanyl. In the UK it said nitazines were often mixed into street drugs like heroin and had led
*25:25.460- 25:32.080* :  to a number of deaths. The report also warned that cocaine production was surging and that global
*25:32.080- 25:39.500* :  cocaine use was at an all-time high. It noted that increases in cocaine use were particularly steep
*25:39.500- 25:47.400* :  after the COVID-19 pandemic. Bethany Bell, incredibly worrying, that is how health experts have
*25:47.400- 25:52.780* :  described a new strain of the M-pox virus in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*25:53.400- 25:58.180* :  The virus, which used to be called monkeypox, can cause lesions across the whole body.
*25:58.180- 26:04.140* :  The World Health Organization says nearly 400 people have died as a result of it this year.
*26:04.640- 26:10.620* :  Our Health reporter, Philippa Roxby, told me why WHO officials are so concerned about the new strain.
*26:11.160- 26:14.620* :  They've analysed it from initial cases they've analysed in the lab and they think these
*26:14.620- 26:19.840* :  mutations look quite dangerous, looks like it'll make the virus very easy to spread among humans.
*26:20.500- 26:25.240* :  And they're also seeing very early evidence of these cases along the eastern edge of the DRC.
*26:25.940- 26:30.320* :  And they can see that it's not only being spread by sexual transmission, they can see that it's
*26:30.380- 26:36.820* :  also probably being spread by skin-to-skin contact. And that means that a lot more people can be
*26:36.820- 26:41.400* :  infected. They're seeing it in children who have played together in a playground. They're seeing
*26:41.400- 26:47.540* :  it in families who live in the same house. And also in health workers who are treating patients
*26:47.540- 26:52.300* :  who've been infected. So they're seeing it in lots of other people. And that's what making them
*26:52.420- 26:56.680* :  worried. Although there's still a lot of investigating to do about how fast it really spreads.
*26:57.260- 27:03.340* :  Awful for that part of the DRC, but the good news I suppose is because it's so remote there
*27:04.920- 27:07.200* :  may well not have spread beyond that area.
*27:08.200- 27:12.940* :  It's possible, it's possible, although that also makes it difficult to detect people who are
*27:12.940- 27:17.100* :  infected. And that is the worry they think that there could be a lot of hidden cases that just
*27:17.100- 27:21.560* :  don't know about. So they've got a figure, they've got their measuring a figure, but they can see
*27:21.560- 27:26.740* :  more and more people coming to health clinics in that region every day. And they're worried that
*27:26.740- 27:31.360* :  people can cross the border. It's very close to the border with Rwanda and Burundi and Uganda. And
*27:31.360- 27:35.480* :  they're worried that people are crossing that border. And the World Health Organization have said
*27:35.480- 27:40.820* :  themselves. They're worried about international spread. And of course, there's very poor access
*27:40.820- 27:46.900* :  to vaccines and treatments in those parts of Africa too, because quite frankly, they have a whole
*27:46.900- 27:51.900* :  lot of other things, health priorities to worry about there. It's a lot of insecurity, conflict,
*27:52.360- 27:55.900* :  war. It's a very difficult place to cope with any sort of disease.
*27:56.640- 28:03.480* :  Philippa Roxby. More than 200,000 people are on the move to the West of England with clean
*28:03.480- 28:09.920* :  tents and high expectations. The gates at the Glastonbury Festival have opened today. Well, the
*28:09.920- 28:15.920* :  festival which started on a farm in 1970 has attracted all the greats and musical royalty over the
*28:15.920- 28:21.820* :  decades. And this year is no different. On Sunday, Shania Twain will play the so-called legend set
*28:21.820- 28:28.740* :  performed by a seasoned star following in the steps of Dolly Parton, Kylie Minogue and Lionel Richie.
*28:29.200- 28:33.420* :  Shania Twain has been speaking to our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
*28:36.820- 28:42.620* :  Let's go girls. Long before Taylor Swift, there was another female country singer who incorporated a
*28:42.620- 28:51.060* :  pop sound into their music and became a phenomenon. Shania Twain's late 90s album come on over.
*28:51.200- 28:56.660* :  It's one of the top 10 global bestsellers of all time. This weekend, she follows the likes of
*28:56.660- 29:02.960* :  Lionel Richie, Dolly Parton and Kylie Minogue by playing Glastonbury's Sunday Tea Time Legends slot.
*29:04.160- 29:07.640* :  I've been told that is the slide. You know Lionel Richie? I know Lionel Richie.
*29:07.640- 29:12.400* :  Now, he had one of the best days of his life doing it. So he's the one I should ask.
*29:13.640- 29:19.780* :  It's surreal to have been invited. I'm a little overwhelmed. I mean, from the minute it was even a
*29:19.780- 29:25.880* :  possibility, I had to keep it a secret. Then it's just been a flurry of everyone sharing all
*29:25.880- 29:31.880* :  other fabulous stories and how exciting it's going to be and bring my wellies. And now I'm thinking
*29:31.880- 29:36.620* :  of which wellies should I bring? I've got several friends at home. I should have buy new ones.
*29:36.880- 29:40.340* :  Have you got rainstone on your wellies? I don't. Should I get someone to wear it?
*29:41.160- 29:45.420* :  Yeah. Okay. So your Brad Pitt? That don't impress me much.
*29:46.940- 29:53.940* :  People who come to watch the Legends, a lot of them wear fancy dress off the act. So let's go
*29:53.940- 30:01.220* :  through some of the iconic Shania looks. That don't impress me much. How would you come dressed
*30:01.220- 30:06.740* :  as in that video, would you say? Anything in leopard print. Any color of leopard print.
