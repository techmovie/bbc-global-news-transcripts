*01:23.220- 01:29.880* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 28th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:30.460- 01:34.980* :  US Democrats debate whether to stick with Joe Biden after his full-tring performance
*01:34.980- 01:37.180* :  in the election debate with Donald Trump.
*01:37.600- 01:43.420* :  Continuing unrest in Kenya despite the government's shelving of controversial tax rises, the
*01:43.420- 01:45.900* :  industry benefiting from India's heat wave.
*01:48.240- 01:54.040* :  Although in this podcast, white conservationists want to make the horns of rhinos radioactive.
*01:54.100- 02:00.560* :  We significantly increase the chances of that horn being detected as it's moved across
*02:00.560- 02:04.800* :  international borders, airport harbors, border crossing, things like that.
*02:05.220- 02:10.820* :  And New Balls, please, how a different kind of tennis ball could change the game.
*02:14.600- 02:20.420* :  It was not a rematch that anyone in America desperately wanted to see, but after the CNN
*02:20.420- 02:25.480* :  presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump last night, it is the Democrats
*02:25.480- 02:26.680* :  who will be most worried.
*02:27.040- 02:31.500* :  The Biden campaign had been hoping the 81-year-old president would be able to put to bed
*02:31.500- 02:36.840* :  questions about his age, but he failed spectacularly while his rival came out swinging.
*02:37.240- 02:41.320* :  Our senior North America correspondent Gary Adonahu reports from Atlanta.
*02:44.280- 02:49.520* :  For the first time in debate history, a former president arriving to debate a current president.
*02:51.220- 02:56.360* :  That current president aiming to be the oldest incumbent of the White House in US history.
*02:56.740- 02:57.300* :  It's Joe Biden.
*02:57.600- 03:01.620* :  Four years ago, when these two men met, it ended up in a slanging match.
*03:01.900- 03:06.100* :  Donald Trump, but even new rules, didn't stop the insults from flying.
*03:06.500- 03:10.900* :  The reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president that I'm going to make America great again.
*03:11.080- 03:14.000* :  My son was not a loser, he was not a sucker, you're the sucker.
*03:15.140- 03:18.220* :  At times Joe Biden sounded horse and difficult to understand.
*03:18.220- 03:23.460* :  His eight said he had a cold, but there have been persistent concerns about his concentration
*03:23.680- 03:26.800* :  and stamina, and this did not dispel those worries.
*03:26.980- 03:37.340* :  It's good to be dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.
*03:38.400- 03:43.980* :  Abortion and immigration were hotly contested with Donald Trump delivering perhaps his strongest
*03:43.980- 03:44.840* :  line of the night.
*03:45.340- 03:50.680* :  We are living right now in a rat's nest, they're killing our people in New York, in California,
*03:50.680- 03:54.460* :  and every state in the union, because we don't have borders anymore.
*03:54.460- 03:56.160* :  Every state is now a border.
*03:56.500- 04:02.020* :  When both men were asked about their age, Joe Biden is 81, Donald Trump's 78, they ended
*04:02.020- 04:04.560* :  up in a bizarre argument about gold.
*04:05.260- 04:09.440* :  I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry on bag, think you can do it.
*04:10.000- 04:10.920* :  That's the biggest line.
*04:10.980- 04:12.720* :  He's a six-handy cap of all.
*04:13.220- 04:14.720* :  I was an eight-handy cap now.
*04:15.220- 04:15.440* :  Eight?
*04:16.300- 04:18.640* :  I've seen it this way, I know you've seen it.
*04:18.940- 04:21.940* :  There was little in this debate to change the minds of the committed.
*04:22.460- 04:24.880* :  Both men made well-worn attacks on one another.
*04:25.180- 04:28.120* :  Both men held well-worn insults at one another.
*04:28.480- 04:32.580* :  What will really count is how this lands with a small number of undecided voters
*04:33.020- 04:36.340* :  in those key swing states that will decide November's election.
*04:36.900- 04:37.980* :  Gary O'Donough here.
*04:38.700- 04:43.020* :  Some Democrats have raised questions about whether there will now be a last-ditch attempt
*04:43.020- 04:45.220* :  to replace Mr. Biden as the parties candidate.
*04:45.640- 04:48.240* :  Claire McCaskill is a former Democratic senator.
*04:48.700- 04:52.400* :  Joe Biden had one thing he had to do tonight, and he didn't do it.
*04:52.580- 04:57.180* :  And that was reassure America that he was up to the job at his age.
*04:57.560- 05:03.880* :  My phone blowing up with senators and campaign operatives, big donors from all over the
*05:03.880- 05:08.680* :  country, does that mean that Joe Biden is not going to be the candidate?
*05:09.260- 05:09.780* :  I don't know.
*05:10.400- 05:15.120* :  Based on what I'm hearing, I do think people feel like that we are confronting a crisis.
*05:15.660- 05:20.740* :  Claire McCaskill, Oliver Conway, asked our US correspondent John Sudworth, who's in Atlanta,
*05:21.320- 05:22.840* :  how bad it was for the president.
*05:23.440- 05:28.900* :  Obviously, leaving partisan politics aside, Oliver, objectively very bad.
*05:28.900- 05:32.080* :  This was a debate that the Democrats asked for.
*05:32.360- 05:38.180* :  It was one in which Mr. Biden really had one job, which was to delay those concerns
*05:38.360- 05:40.800* :  about his age and mental competence.
*05:41.380- 05:47.660* :  And few believe, even within his own party, that he was able to accomplish that mission.
*05:48.000- 05:48.800* :  He was faltering.
*05:48.800- 05:52.540* :  He sometimes appeared unable to complete his train of thought.
*05:53.320- 05:58.780* :  And when you consider that, actually, in normal circumstances, Donald Trump's performance
*05:58.780- 06:02.040* :  would not have been considered particularly impressive.
*06:02.040- 06:03.480* :  It was full of falsehoods.
*06:03.740- 06:05.840* :  He himself sometimes appeared rambling.
*06:06.280- 06:09.780* :  But in contrast, he looked presidential and measured.
*06:10.160- 06:12.240* :  Mr. Biden really failing to capitalize.
*06:12.260- 06:16.440* :  And there is no doubt about it, although his supporters will rally around him.
*06:16.680- 06:21.180* :  We heard Vice President Kamala Harris admitting that he had a shaky start, but saying ultimately
*06:21.180- 06:26.060* :  this is a contest about record and performance, not about style over substance.
*06:26.720- 06:31.540* :  There is no doubt there is deep alarm, you know, within the Democrat Party, with just four
*06:31.540- 06:32.840* :  months to go until the election.
*06:33.180- 06:38.500* :  Yeah, and is there any realistic prospect of replacing him as the party's candidate?
*06:38.500- 06:40.040* :  And if so, what would be the process?
*06:40.760- 06:45.560* :  It's really very difficult, you know, even for those party insiders who might have had
*06:45.560- 06:50.200* :  their worries before last night's debate to know how this could be accomplished.
*06:50.200- 06:55.000* :  The discussion is absolutely underway, even if largely taking part behind closed doors.
*06:55.020- 07:01.420* :  The trouble is, Joe Biden is the Democratic Party primary victor.
*07:01.460- 07:07.240* :  He won those primary contests, pretty much hands down, a few minor challenges.
*07:07.560- 07:12.740* :  He is heading into the Democrat National Convention in August, which, until last night, looked
*07:12.780- 07:14.960* :  like it was going to be a coronation.
*07:15.440- 07:22.520* :  Fear him to step down, the first hurdle, Oliver, would be that he needs to do it voluntarily.
*07:22.520- 07:25.400* :  There are a few ways that the party can force him to do it.
*07:25.780- 07:30.820* :  And at the moment, all indications heading into this debate suggest that he has no intention
*07:30.820- 07:31.620* :  of doing so.
*07:32.080- 07:35.580* :  And if he doesn't, what are his chances of beating Donald Trump in November?
*07:36.080- 07:37.140* :  You know, it's very difficult.
*07:37.140- 07:41.820* :  The polls are pretty much neck and neck, if not showing a slight advantage to Donald
*07:41.820- 07:47.040* :  Trump within the margin of error, but in those key battleground states, Donald Trump does
*07:47.040- 07:51.420* :  have the slight upper hand, if the polls are to be believed, you know, last night was
*07:51.420- 07:56.780* :  meant to be a point at which Joe Biden began to shift the dials and move the needle.
*07:57.120- 08:01.600* :  I think you have to wonder, given last night's performance, whether he's done anything
*08:01.600- 08:03.160* :  to improve his chances at all.
*08:03.540- 08:04.960* :  John Sudworth in Atlanta.
*08:05.740- 08:10.120* :  During the debate, the two men sketch out sharply differing views on many of the current
*08:10.120- 08:11.020* :  global issues.
*08:11.280- 08:13.420* :  So what did the rest of the world make of it all?
*08:13.880- 08:19.400* :  We got reaction from our security correspondent Gordon Carrera in Kiev, a Middle East correspondent
*08:19.400- 08:24.560* :  Joe Lantnell in Bethlehem, and first the BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*08:24.940- 08:29.900* :  He's in Moscow where the Kremlin insisted the debate was not on its agenda and refused
*08:29.900- 08:30.840* :  to comment on it.
*08:31.360- 08:36.060* :  We don't know whether Vladimir Putin stayed up late to watch the US presidential debate.
*08:36.060- 08:41.500* :  If he did, then I reckon he would have enjoyed the spectacle, particularly Joe Biden's
*08:42.000- 08:42.740* :  shaky performance.
*08:42.820- 08:48.800* :  I mean, keep in mind that previously President Biden had publicly described Vladimir Putin
*08:48.800- 08:49.620* :  as a killer.
*08:50.040- 08:51.840* :  They'd vowed to stand by Ukraine.
*08:51.840- 08:57.080* :  Certainly, I think the Kremlin will have noted and appreciated Donald Trump's criticism
*08:57.660- 09:00.700* :  of the scale of US military assistance to Kiev.
*09:01.280- 09:05.240* :  And what's more, at times, it sounded as if Donald Trump was actually blaming Joe Biden
*09:05.240- 09:08.320* :  more than Vladimir Putin for Russia's war in Ukraine.
*09:08.320- 09:12.700* :  He said that Joe Biden had encouraged Russia to go into Ukraine.
*09:13.260- 09:17.900* :  He said that Ukraine had lost so many people and those gorgeous cities with golden domes
*09:17.900- 09:21.320* :  that are a thousand years old, all because of him, Joe Biden.
*09:21.540- 09:23.660* :  That will have gone down what, I think, in the Kremlin.
*09:24.580- 09:29.180* :  There's no country outside of the United States where the result of the election, the debate
*09:29.180- 09:31.780* :  matters more than here in Ukraine.
*09:31.780- 09:37.600* :  That's because of the importance of US military and financial support for Ukraine in sustaining
*09:37.600- 09:42.080* :  its effort to fight off that Russian invasion of the country.
*09:42.700- 09:46.620* :  Now there hasn't been an official reaction, and I think politicians here will likely be
*09:46.620- 09:52.700* :  cautious about being seen to wade into American politics and antagonize someone who might
*09:52.700- 09:57.120* :  be president in the future, but I think they will have looked on carefully at that debate.
*09:57.580- 10:02.400* :  Some themes that we've heard before, the criticism by Donald Trump about the amount
*10:02.400- 10:07.380* :  of money that's gone to Ukraine, him using that figure of $200 billion, Donald Trump's
*10:07.380- 10:12.940* :  talk as well that he could somehow bring about a deal before he even enters office after
*10:12.940- 10:14.060* :  he's elected.
*10:14.520- 10:17.960* :  But the contours of what that might look like were very unclear.
*10:18.480- 10:22.160* :  I mean, there's been talk that perhaps he could use that financial aid as leverage to
*10:22.160- 10:26.660* :  try and bring both sides to the negotiating table, but that's very different from actually
*10:26.660- 10:30.920* :  coming to a deal which the Ukrainians in particular would be content with.
*10:30.940- 10:36.280* :  And Donald Trump was pressed on whether Ukraine would effectively have to give in to Russian
*10:36.280- 10:38.860* :  demands about seeding some of its territory.
*10:39.280- 10:43.000* :  And Donald Trump pushed that away, but didn't really give the kind of detail you might
*10:43.000- 10:43.300* :  want.
*10:43.640- 10:48.220* :  I think there will be some concern here about the outcome of that presidential election,
*10:48.680- 10:53.980* :  about what Donald Trump presidency might mean if he won, but also a knowledge that under
*10:53.980- 11:00.140* :  President Biden has been sometimes slow to get the military and financial aid that Ukraine
*11:00.140- 11:03.340* :  says it desperately needs to keep up its war effort.
*11:03.900- 11:08.300* :  The White House race has real consequences, so of course this was being extremely closely
*11:08.300- 11:09.080* :  watched here.
*11:09.540- 11:13.340* :  In terms of the tone and the substance from both of the candidates, things were very similar
*11:13.340- 11:16.560* :  to what they've said recently and on the campaign trail.
*11:16.620- 11:22.600* :  We did have, though, Donald Trump accusing President Biden of siding with the Palestinians
*11:22.600- 11:25.240* :  of sort of being soft on Hamas.
*11:25.240- 11:29.580* :  He said that he should let Israel in his words finish the job.
*11:29.980- 11:33.600* :  And then in one of the more bizarre moments of the debate, he accused President Biden
*11:33.600- 11:37.460* :  of acting, he said, like a Palestinian, like a weak one.
*11:37.820- 11:43.780* :  Now President Biden retorted that he had secured this three-phase plan to end the war,
*11:43.780- 11:48.960* :  that that was backed by the G7, the UN Security Council, and importantly by Israel.
*11:48.960- 11:54.220* :  He said that it was Hamas that once the war to continue, he reiterated that point, then
*11:54.540- 11:55.720* :  Donald Trump came back.
*11:56.040- 12:01.080* :  And he was saying that in his view, it was Israel that was the party that wanted to continue
*12:01.080- 12:05.060* :  the war and he said that it was really President Trump that was holding them back and was
*12:05.060- 12:07.000* :  not giving them the tools to do so.
*12:07.880- 12:12.920* :  America's relationship with China was also discussed, including military tensions over Taiwan
*12:12.920- 12:16.680* :  and U.S. trading links with the world's second largest economy.
*12:16.680- 12:20.140* :  The political analyst Gordon Chang gave us his assessment.
*12:20.720- 12:24.880* :  There were a number of mentions of China, but there was remarkably little substance.
*12:25.080- 12:29.520* :  The candidates focused on who was going to pay for the tariffs that President Trump
*12:29.520- 12:30.780* :  has talked about imposing.
*12:30.780- 12:33.080* :  Biden said that it's going to contribute to inflation.
*12:33.620- 12:36.360* :  And Trump said the Chinese are going to pay for them.
*12:36.760- 12:42.200* :  The one thing about China, though, is what did the Chinese officials and leaders think
*12:42.200- 12:43.300* :  about tonight's debate?
*12:43.300- 12:49.200* :  And this was a sad day for America, because they saw a president who just was not capable,
*12:49.520- 12:50.840* :  whatever one thinks of policy.
*12:51.160- 12:56.360* :  So I think that this is a moment of concern for the United States and for his allies and
*12:56.360- 12:56.780* :  partners.
*12:57.140- 13:02.380* :  I'm worried that China, which is already pressing the United States, in, for instance,
*13:02.380- 13:07.040* :  the second Thomas Scholl in the South China Sea, could decide that the United States was
*13:07.040- 13:07.740* :  not capable.
*13:08.040- 13:12.520* :  You know, President Biden's administration, his State Department and the President himself
*13:12.520- 13:17.580* :  have given China about a dozen warnings that the United States was prepared to use force
*13:18.080- 13:22.980* :  against China to discharge our obligations to the Philippines pursuant to our 1951
*13:22.980- 13:23.980* :  mutual defense treaty.
*13:24.260- 13:26.020* :  China has ignored those warnings.
*13:26.020- 13:31.940* :  I think after tonight, they'll be even more bold in trying to pressure the Philippines
*13:32.500- 13:34.320* :  in disregard of the United States.
*13:34.820- 13:35.520* :  Gordon Chang.
*13:36.500- 13:41.220* :  On Thursday, though, he yet more protests in Kenya, despite the President withdrawing
*13:41.220- 13:42.720* :  his controversial tax plans.
*13:42.740- 13:47.440* :  Earlier violent protests had led to several deaths and the parliament was set on fire.
*13:47.900- 13:52.420* :  These latest protests were smaller, though, and less violent than before, even though in
*13:52.420- 13:55.040* :  the Capitol and Nairobi tear gas was used by the police.
*13:55.100- 14:01.020* :  Luke Jones spoke to the current government spokesman of Kenya, Isaac Mwara, and asked him
*14:01.020- 14:02.940* :  what he made of the latest unrest.
*14:03.500- 14:07.420* :  For now, you can see the demonstrations are subsided after the President backed down on
*14:07.420- 14:11.200* :  the issue of the finance bill, because he rejected it and sent it back to parliament.
*14:11.820- 14:13.440* :  So really, I think that is it.
*14:13.440- 14:16.240* :  They had planned too much to state us today that has not been successful.
*14:16.940- 14:21.060* :  And you know, basically, the whole issue of the finance bill, I think, is now behind
*14:21.060- 14:21.240* :  this.
*14:21.620- 14:23.100* :  It's not quite behind us, though, is it?
*14:23.160- 14:27.400* :  And there are still many, many people protesting in cities tear gas is still being thrown
*14:27.400- 14:27.780* :  at them.
*14:28.000- 14:30.440* :  There's a lot of unhappiness still around.
*14:30.920- 14:31.660* :  What is the President going to do?
*14:31.660- 14:32.600* :  Try and tackle that.
*14:32.900- 14:35.980* :  No, I think after we are done with this whole issue of the finance bill, there are other
*14:35.980- 14:38.920* :  issues that have been addressed, you know, from Kenya's, because I've been listening
*14:38.920- 14:43.880* :  to them as the government spokesman on Twitter, on other platforms, and we'll have a national
*14:43.880- 14:47.040* :  dialogue with regards to what they want us to change as the government.
*14:47.400- 14:50.840* :  You know, there are various issues that we've also made reports to that effect that have
*14:50.840- 14:53.440* :  been extremely important for our own feedback mechanism.
*14:53.980- 14:57.780* :  So really, we do appreciate this kind of dialogue that has been generated by this finance
*14:59.400- 14:59.420* :  bill.
*14:59.420- 15:01.540* :  And it also means that Kenya's are very, very much abreast to what is happening.
*15:01.980- 15:03.660* :  And people want to see that dialogue happen.
*15:04.220- 15:07.380* :  When will it actually happen, though, and what form will it take?
*15:07.660- 15:12.040* :  It's more like a most de sectoral forum where we have representation of various groupings
*15:12.040- 15:16.400* :  of people, and especially the young people, and the President will be making such announcements
*15:16.940- 15:17.360* :  going forward.
*15:17.360- 15:18.780* :  No, what we are witnessing now.
*15:18.880- 15:21.420* :  You say going forward, you know, when he'll make an announcement on that?
*15:21.500- 15:24.520* :  It should be soon, because he has promised that he wants to engage the people.
*15:24.620- 15:29.500* :  But as soon in the next few days, in a few weeks, a few months, how soon is soon?
*15:29.620- 15:32.460* :  In the next few days, but I don't want to say exactly what the time is, because it is
*15:32.460- 15:33.840* :  him only who can determine that.
*15:34.240- 15:37.500* :  But believe me, it's going to be because, of course, he has made that promise and that
*15:37.520- 15:37.840* :  offer.
*15:38.100- 15:41.460* :  So what we are seeing is a many pressure groups are making some demands here and there.
*15:41.640- 15:44.660* :  The youth themselves, and various groupings of their youth, we have seen them holding
*15:44.660- 15:48.920* :  press conferences, and also young persons with disabilities, the workers, the board of
*15:48.920- 15:49.380* :  the writers.
*15:49.920- 15:53.440* :  And that is what you want to have, because, you know, the dialogue is really the real
*15:53.720- 15:54.660* :  alternative to violence.
*15:54.660- 15:58.780* :  We cannot have violence and destroy our country that we have built for so many years.
*15:58.980- 16:03.640* :  There's, of course, been violence from the police side as well, and we've had, according
*16:03.640- 16:08.320* :  to at least Amnesty International, multiple people abducted, disappeared by uniformed
*16:08.320- 16:09.880* :  and non-uniformed officers.
*16:10.880- 16:16.020* :  That has made people angry at why was that allowed to happen, and what kind of investigation
*16:16.300- 16:17.200* :  will they be into?
*16:17.820- 16:18.420* :  What happened?
*16:18.700- 16:22.640* :  There are peaceful protesters and people who are genuinely involved in this whole, you
*16:22.640- 16:27.260* :  know, debate, and that we must comment, because it is according to article 37 of the Constitution
*16:27.260- 16:29.440* :  that people can protest in a peaceful manner.
*16:29.680- 16:33.420* :  But then there are also criminal elements, there are people who are inciting others.
*16:33.760- 16:37.200* :  There are those who also wanted a coup, the tar, and we could see that.
*16:37.200- 16:39.980* :  They wanted a regime change, and they were talking about that.
*16:40.060- 16:44.720* :  Even when the bill has already been rejected by the president, they are still insisting
*16:44.840- 16:48.700* :  that they wanted too much to set out, and so those are the kind of elements that need
*16:48.700- 16:52.320* :  to give us more information and tell us what is the case, but any law abiding citizen
*16:52.320- 16:52.920* :  is okay.
*16:53.300- 16:57.620* :  In fact, I want to dispute that report by Amnesty International, they need to shed more
*16:57.620- 17:01.780* :  details on what they mean, because majority of the peaceful Kenyans were not affected
*17:01.780- 17:04.020* :  and they went unharmed even during this demonstration.
*17:04.220- 17:08.280* :  You can't draw a line, though, between those who are peacefully protesting and the criminal
*17:08.280- 17:08.720* :  elements.
*17:08.860- 17:15.000* :  Even criminals shouldn't be forcibly abducted by ununiformed officers, shouldn't be killed
*17:15.400- 17:16.560* :  by officers, should they?
*17:16.560- 17:20.220* :  So, even if it happens to suspected criminals, that is not okay.
*17:20.220- 17:26.340* :  Allow me to differ with you, strongly, voluble, you cannot condone criminal activity.
*17:26.740- 17:27.800* :  That is not part of our constitution.
*17:27.980- 17:30.940* :  That is anarchy that is actually trying to destabilize our country.
*17:31.440- 17:32.300* :  Isaac Moura
*17:33.240- 17:38.280* :  India is experiencing more than its usual share of heatwaves these days, and since mid-May,
*17:38.280- 17:43.660* :  the daily temperatures in Delhi have consistently stayed around 40 degrees Celsius.
*17:44.000- 17:49.540* :  These sticky days and nights are good news for one sector, air conditioning, where sales
*17:49.540- 17:51.940* :  are up as the BBC's Mariko oil reports.
*17:52.600- 18:00.860* :  Only about 8% of the country's 300 million households own air conditioners, so 93% of
*18:00.860- 18:03.760* :  them usually rely on fans for comfort.
*18:03.860- 18:09.960* :  But over the last five decades, the country has faced more than 700 heatwaves, but many
*18:09.960- 18:15.500* :  say that this summer's heat severe and I'm relenting heat is among the worst.
*18:15.780- 18:21.460* :  And as a result, sales of air conditioners could grow by some 60% of this summer, that's
*18:21.460- 18:24.580* :  up from the usual 25 to 30%.
*18:24.780- 18:29.700* :  You can't blame people for wanting to buy air cons, but at the same time, how that's
*18:29.700- 18:33.300* :  going to affect climate change is something that many experts are worried about.
*18:33.600- 18:34.480* :  Mariko oil
*18:37.640- 18:42.660* :  Coming up six weeks after the Iranian President died in a helicopter crash, the people
*18:42.660- 18:47.680* :  are called to elect a successor, but with a tightly restricted field of candidates, how
*18:47.680- 18:49.120* :  many of them will bother voting.
*18:57.900- 18:58.640* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*18:58.640- 19:02.600* :  At Mid-Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*19:02.840- 19:05.240* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*19:05.580- 19:10.060* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided
*19:10.060- 19:12.980* :  to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*19:13.280- 19:17.580* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15

*20:03.440- 20:10.240* :  The forthcoming election in France looks likely to pose a challenge to President Emmanuel
*20:10.240- 20:13.880* :  Macron, even though it is not his job that is up for grabs.
*20:13.900- 20:19.240* :  Mr. Macron has warned that support for extreme parties on the right and the left threatened
*20:19.240- 20:21.120* :  to plunge the country into civil war.
*20:21.520- 20:26.480* :  The first round in the surprise parliamentary election takes place this weekend with the
*20:26.480- 20:29.300* :  far right widely predicted to take first place.
*20:29.720- 20:34.200* :  To gauge the public mood, our correspondent Andrew Harding has been to Brittany, long
*20:34.200- 20:37.500* :  considered one of the most politically moderate corners of France.
*20:40.980- 20:45.880* :  The weather is finally gorgeous here, when the beaches of southern Brittany are filling
*20:45.880- 20:46.200* :  up.
*20:47.280- 20:52.260* :  The Olympics around the corner, surely a language French summer backings.
*20:53.260- 20:55.760* :  Or does it?
*20:57.340- 21:00.680* :  In the pretty market town of Aray, Tempers are strained.
*21:00.940- 21:06.140* :  Political polarisation has finally arrived in rural, famously moderate Brittany.
*21:07.060- 21:12.180* :  Solem and Alain run a market stall, but when two young men walk past campaigning for the
*21:12.180- 21:15.940* :  hard-right national rally party, the couple seed.
*21:16.100- 21:18.900* :  It's fascism, it's fascism, says Alain.
*21:19.260- 21:20.620* :  My call is spade, a spade.
*21:22.160- 21:24.580* :  We hate their ideas, says Solem.
*21:24.580- 21:26.460* :  We hate everything about them.
*21:29.180- 21:34.060* :  One of the national rally campaigners is a 19-year-old student, Mattis Oje.
*21:34.060- 21:38.000* :  He thinks mass immigration is ruining France.
*21:41.620- 21:43.200* :  We have an identity crisis.
*21:43.700- 21:48.000* :  The foreigners keep apart, they shop in their own markets, they don't speak our language.
*21:48.320- 21:52.680* :  I feel that I no longer have my rightful place as a Frenchman, that I'm being forced
*21:52.680- 21:53.140* :  to change.
*21:53.860- 21:59.860* :  Opinion polls here suggest that message amplified by the media is cutting through and that
*21:59.860- 22:04.880* :  the hard-right is poised to come first this weekend in the first round of parliamentary
*22:04.880- 22:08.100* :  elections, even here in sleepy Brittany.
*22:08.920- 22:16.940* :  We have a history, a culture, says Alain, a retired fireman, I'm worried, he says.
*22:17.580- 22:26.620* :  On the television here, a succession of increasingly shrill debates between French political
*22:26.620- 22:33.420* :  camps, the left has quickly united against the hard-right, but stranded between them,
*22:33.420- 22:36.160* :  the centre is wobbly and shrinking.
*22:38.080- 22:41.900* :  I've come along the coast now to L'Oreal, a big port city.
*22:42.640- 22:47.580* :  Basketball practice for a group of children in a poor and overwhelmingly immigrant community.
*22:48.660- 22:53.780* :  You can see the effort that's gone into helping people integrate here with some success,
*22:54.600- 22:55.540* :  but for how much longer?
*22:56.480- 23:02.600* :  You get a really clear sense of the kind of shock that this election is causing in neighbourhoods
*23:02.780- 23:03.220* :  like this.
*23:03.460- 23:08.660* :  Just round the corner at a place called the Meso-Portuce, the House for All, it's a local
*23:09.400- 23:15.060* :  organisation publicly funded that helps particularly young people, and the people who run this place
*23:15.060- 23:22.600* :  have taken a decision openly now to campaign against the National Rally, they're that concern
*23:22.600- 23:29.120* :  that this far-right party poses a direct challenge to the fundamental values of the French
*23:29.300- 23:29.480* :  state.
*23:30.100- 23:32.340* :  It's my pleasure, Maxime, I'm the director of the Meso-Portuce.
*23:32.460- 23:34.960* :  Maxime Goodfrey runs the organisation.
*23:34.960- 23:40.800* :  We never tell people who to vote for, he says to me, but this time we've taken the liberty
*23:40.800- 23:46.000* :  of saying that from our point of view, people should not vote for the National Rally because
*23:46.000- 23:46.680* :  it's dangerous.
*23:47.540- 23:52.900* :  Dangerous or not, the polls now show this city, which used to lean communist, has now
*23:52.900- 23:54.840* :  swerved towards the hard right.
*23:56.800- 24:03.140* :  Watching the world go by from a nearby cafe is side, a pension originally from Algeria.
*24:03.500- 24:07.620* :  The National Rally is dangerous, he says.
*24:07.620- 24:12.160* :  My wife wears the veil, but they want to ban it, so she's afraid.
*24:13.380- 24:16.100* :  If they get into power, it will be catastrophic.
*24:19.940- 24:24.160* :  Back at the beach, a few bathers are braving, Britain is chilly waters.
*24:24.860- 24:30.660* :  What happens in the next few weeks here is unclear, it could be political deadlock, it could
*24:30.660- 24:38.140* :  be a hard right landslide, a violent reaction, constitutional upheavals, an anxious summer awaits.
*24:40.720- 24:42.480* :  Andrew Harding in Brittany.
*24:42.960- 24:48.300* :  Less than six weeks after Iran's president, Ibrahim Reisi died in a helicopter crash, Iranian
*24:48.300- 24:50.780* :  voters have the chance to elect his successor.
*24:51.360- 24:56.720* :  But despite calls for a big turnout from the nation's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
*24:57.160- 25:00.720* :  many people are expected to stay away from the polling stations.
*25:00.780- 25:05.680* :  Barman Calbassi from BBC Persian spoke to Victoria Uwankunda.
*25:06.220- 25:10.080* :  The supreme leader and his appointees really filter people who can run.
*25:10.820- 25:16.960* :  So what we're presented as final candidates are people who are approved by the supreme leader.
*25:17.620- 25:23.580* :  One of them, it belongs to a more moderate camp politically in Iran known as the Reformists.
*25:23.840- 25:29.960* :  And the Reformists used to have a president in Iran in 1997, 2005, and then later President
*25:29.960- 25:33.300* :  Rohani that was also closer to the Reformists.
*25:33.360- 25:39.360* :  And there is an invisible candidate running and that is a big sectors of society in Iran
*25:39.360- 25:43.560* :  who want to boycott this election entirely and not participate in it.
*25:43.760- 25:50.460* :  Would the powerful Guardian Council be looking for someone as similar or close to let President
*25:50.460- 25:56.460* :  Rahim Reisi, who was very close to Ayatollah Khamenei, or are they completely looking for
*25:56.500- 25:57.600* :  somebody different?
*25:58.080- 26:03.740* :  Well, they have done their part, which is to filter out and not allow bar a lot of people
*26:03.740- 26:04.340* :  from running.
*26:04.340- 26:09.820* :  Now we've left with this for, do they want this moderate to win?
*26:09.880- 26:13.600* :  It's unlikely that they have any interest to want him to win.
*26:13.600- 26:16.840* :  Will they intervene if he does win?
*26:17.440- 26:18.560* :  They can't really do that.
*26:19.160- 26:26.340* :  So it remains to be seen whether the hardline candidates will just win outright or will
*26:26.340- 26:30.700* :  it go to a second round if nobody gets a 50% plus one vote.
*26:31.160- 26:33.960* :  And then we will have one moderate and one of the hardliners.
*26:34.260- 26:40.720* :  If we do see a low voter turnout, is that a reflection of where Iran is politically
*26:40.720- 26:46.380* :  at the moment, or is it just because people at this very moment in time, they feel there's
*26:46.380- 26:51.520* :  no point in voting for anybody who technically really doesn't have that much power because
*26:51.520- 26:53.900* :  everything rests with a supreme leader.
*26:54.320- 27:00.660* :  It has been a fact of Iranian politics in the last three years, at least, and two elections
*27:00.700- 27:05.220* :  have been held in the last three years, one that led to Mr. Reisi's election and a parliamentary
*27:05.220- 27:05.760* :  election.
*27:06.280- 27:12.820* :  That in these elections, the turnout has been incredibly low, under 40%, so that gives
*27:12.820- 27:19.200* :  you a sense, the apathy and lack of any interest in participating exactly for the reason you
*27:19.200- 27:24.860* :  mentioned that the presidents have diminished power and the Supreme Leader calls all the
*27:24.860- 27:26.160* :  shots at the end of the day.
*27:26.160- 27:32.140* :  So what is the point of choosing between weak candidates of this camp or the other camp
*27:32.580- 27:38.040* :  when everything from foreign policy to domestic policy, even their ministers have to be approved
*27:38.100- 27:38.920* :  by the Supreme Leader.
*27:38.920- 27:44.660* :  That sense is extremely strong and has led to very, very low turnout.
*27:44.660- 27:51.880* :  Now, the question is whether by approving a moderate, one moderate candidate, some sectors
*27:51.880- 27:57.280* :  of the society might think, still it's better to have this moderate guy than with the hard
*27:57.280- 28:00.160* :  liners, and we will see an increased turnout.
*28:00.860- 28:02.020* :  Bahman Kalbassi.
*28:03.160- 28:09.600* :  On average, a rhino is killed for its horn every 20 hours, fewer than 30,000 of them remain
*28:09.600- 28:10.160* :  in the world.
*28:10.520- 28:15.560* :  But scientists in South Africa have come up with a way of putting off poachers by making
*28:15.560- 28:20.040* :  the creatures horns radioactive, this report from Alfie Habishan.
*28:20.360- 28:25.100* :  For many years, conservationists have been urging us to leave rhinos alone, their numbers
*28:25.100- 28:29.580* :  have been on the slide since the start of the 20th century when there were 10 times more
*28:29.580- 28:30.560* :  than there are today.
*28:31.060- 28:36.220* :  The decline is partly due to habitat loss, but also because of illegal poaching gangs
*28:36.220- 28:41.340* :  who are seeking its valuable horn, which can fetch up to a quarter of a million dollars.
*28:42.000- 28:47.260* :  But even so, drilling a hole in it to then put radioactive material inside does sound
*28:47.260- 28:50.980* :  like quite an extreme solution, not to mention a little dangerous.
*28:51.620- 28:53.140* :  So what's the thinking behind it?
*28:53.360- 28:58.040* :  James Larkin of the University of Redvatter's RAND is leader of the Rice at Hope project.
*28:58.040- 29:05.220* :  We significantly increase the chances of that horn being detected as it's moved across
*29:05.220- 29:10.900* :  international borders at airport harbours, because there's a global system of radiation
*29:10.940- 29:17.380* :  monitors put into place some years ago to prevent nuclear terrorism, so we're using that
*29:17.380- 29:17.900* :  system.
*29:18.200- 29:22.600* :  It is also possible that poachers could avoid this by cutting off the radioactive material.
*29:22.980- 29:26.840* :  However, the value of horns that have been trimmed is much lower on illegal poaching
*29:26.840- 29:31.160* :  markets, which is why the scientists say they are confident that this deterrence will
*29:31.160- 29:31.560* :  work.
*29:32.020- 29:36.560* :  They have now put the radioactive material inside an initial 20 rhinos as part of a trial
*29:36.560- 29:39.980* :  run, and Professor Larkin says it will not harm them.
*29:40.220- 29:46.380* :  I've spent the last two years doing those calculations, creating a digital model of
*29:46.380- 29:52.340* :  the rhinos head, and then I'll have Colorado, State and Texas and M University check
*29:52.360- 29:59.300* :  my calculations to make sure that what we're doing is as safe as we claim it to be.
*29:59.600- 30:03.240* :  Over the next six months, the group of rhinos will be closely monitored, and if all goes
*30:03.280- 30:08.900* :  well, the method will be scaled up and offered to the other 30,000 rhinos across Africa.
*30:09.860- 30:10.820* :  Alfie Habershon
*30:11.380- 30:16.880* :  The International Tennis Federation has created a prototype ball that it hopes could help
*30:16.880- 30:18.580* :  make the sport more sustainable.
*30:19.020- 30:23.200* :  The novel design does not have a fabric coating and would have a longer lifespan.
*30:23.200- 30:28.460* :  The new ball, which is still at a very early stage of development, is just one idea being
*30:28.460- 30:32.640* :  considered as our sport's new correspondent Laura Scott reports.
*30:33.120- 30:37.640* :  As Wimbledon approaches, the phrase new balls please will be heard countless times over
*30:37.640- 30:42.020* :  the next fortnight, but scientists from the International Tennis Federation have been
*30:42.020- 30:43.160* :  taking that seriously.
*30:43.780- 30:49.140* :  A prototype that they've created for a new ball, using a 3D printer, has a perforated
*30:49.140- 30:54.360* :  polymer shell around a rubber core, rather than the conventional fluffy yellow outer layer.
*30:54.880- 30:59.840* :  A considerable amount of testing is still required to work out of its viable, and crucially
*30:59.920- 31:01.300* :  more environmentally friendly.
*31:01.860- 31:06.800* :  The federation is also exploring potential wall changes to use fewer balls in matches
*31:07.300- 31:08.900* :  and ways to prolong their lifespan.
*31:09.460- 31:14.100* :  The work will be presented to manufacturers in the near future, in the hope of stimulating
*31:14.100- 31:14.860* :  innovation.
*31:15.260- 31:15.840* :  Laura Scott
*31:18.300- 31:23.400* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the Global News Podcast
