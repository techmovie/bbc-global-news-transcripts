*01:29.980- 01:34.240* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this on Saturday the 29th of June,
*01:34.240- 01:40.800* :  coming up an incredible act of kindness. I just wanted to be able to help him.
*01:40.940- 01:45.440* :  I mean, I had what this five-year-old needed to think of somebody being willing to do that
*01:45.700- 01:50.100* :  for him. I can't even imagine how proud her mother must be.
*01:50.700- 01:54.480* :  The preschool teacher donating part of her liver to her former pupil.
*01:55.540- 01:58.960* :  The groundbreaking injection that prevented HIV infections.
*01:59.740- 02:05.760* :  The zero just really made my hair stand on it because we just haven't seen anything that effective
*02:06.560- 02:09.620* :  in the whole of the AIDS epidemic.
*02:10.520- 02:14.320* :  And we're back in Finland for a rather unusual sporting event.
*02:15.120- 02:20.140* :  Never be afraid of trying something new because you never know what you will like and what you
*02:20.320- 02:22.360* :  what type of hobby you will fall in love with.
*02:22.980- 02:28.100* :  Also in this podcast, the unexpected victory that's boosted Georgian pride.
*02:28.860- 02:35.620* :  With the first time in my life I could see my national flag on BBC and it's not about some
*02:35.620- 02:41.140* :  catastrophic events that are happening there. We are in news in a positive way.
*02:41.900- 02:42.260* :  And
*02:43.260- 02:44.240* :  ...small
*02:48.140- 02:52.440* :  literally it's all stems from me sitting in my car filming myself and an iPhone in lockdown.
*02:57.660- 03:00.880* :  The woman whose online videos led to a new career.
*03:06.560- 03:12.000* :  Now as the more observant of you may have noticed, this is my first time presenting the happy
*03:13.000- 03:17.460* :  pod. In fact it was suggested that I might be too grumpy for the job, but here I am.
*03:17.560- 03:21.880* :  And what better way to brighten my mood than 25 minutes of cheerfulness.
*03:22.600- 03:28.640* :  And this first item certainly took my breath away. Imagine being a young child needing a liver
*03:28.640- 03:33.780* :  transplant and your teacher turns up at your front door offering to share hers.
*03:34.540- 03:37.680* :  Well that is what happened to five-year-old Ezra from New York.
*03:38.380- 03:43.040* :  We'll hear from him and his mum in a moment, but first to his former pre-school teacher
*03:43.040- 03:48.600* :  Carissa Fisher, who was delighted to find that she was a perfect match for the liver transplant.
*03:49.300- 03:54.660* :  You know he was one of those kids where he walks into the room and he kind of just lights up the room.
*03:55.400- 04:01.480* :  So I just wanted to be able to help him. I mean I had what this five-year-old needed.
*04:01.500- 04:07.780* :  Honestly there was not a second thought about it. They finally called me and they were like,
*04:07.780- 04:16.280* :  hey you got approved. Congratulations. So I immediately made Ezra a sign and headed over to his
*04:16.280- 04:21.640* :  house the next day to tell his family. It was emotional and I think Ezra's mom didn't really
*04:21.640- 04:28.220* :  process it up first. Like I think she was just in total shock at that point. She was really excited
*04:28.460- 04:35.520* :  and Ezra you could tell he kind of knew like what was going on. If I were in that situation I would
*04:35.520- 04:41.860* :  want someone to do it for me. That's what it comes down to. This is a five-year-old little boy and
*04:42.180- 04:47.440* :  he can't do five-year-old things and I want him to be able to do those five-year-old things.
*04:48.400- 04:53.940* :  I want him to be able to pay it forward and help somebody else make the world a better place.
*04:54.920- 05:00.060* :  Carissa Fisher and Karen and Ezra told me more about that amazing day.
*05:01.840- 05:04.420* :  Do you remember the day when Miss Carissa came to our house?
*05:04.940- 05:06.920* :  Yeah. Yeah. How did you feel that day?
*05:07.480- 05:08.080* :  Happy.
*05:08.800- 05:10.040* :  What did she come here to tell you?
*05:10.460- 05:11.460* :  I have a few.
*05:12.240- 05:15.420* :  And she has a liver for you. What did she bring with you her for you?
*05:16.080- 05:18.040* :  I can't bear with that moving.
*05:18.480- 05:20.360* :  I can't bear with balloons. What else?
*05:21.760- 05:24.620* :  What was the big paper she had? Do you remember what it said?
*05:26.420- 05:27.600* :  Would you like to share my liver?
*05:28.120- 05:28.400* :  Yeah.
*05:28.700- 05:29.980* :  And what did you have to do with the marker?
*05:30.680- 05:35.240* :  I need a drug so I can have my liver.
*05:35.520- 05:36.560* :  Yeah, to say yes.
*05:37.100- 05:37.400* :  Yes.
*05:37.900- 05:42.980* :  And now you're going to be kind of joined with her forever because you'll have part of her liver.
*05:43.380- 05:44.060* :  Isn't that amazing?
*05:44.740- 05:45.060* :  Yes.
*05:45.840- 05:50.780* :  And Karen, how did you feel when Carissa rang on your doorbell that day?
*05:52.640- 05:53.540* :  Shocked, really.
*05:54.820- 06:01.180* :  I thought they were coming by to drop off maybe a gift or a donation or a collection of some sorts.
*06:01.180- 06:05.120* :  So when they explained, I was just overwhelmed.
*06:05.180- 06:10.100* :  What an amazing moment, a complete change for your life and for Ezra's life.
*06:10.680- 06:14.140* :  Absolutely. We would do whatever we needed to for our own children,
*06:14.140- 06:17.360* :  but to think of somebody being willing to do that for him,
*06:17.840- 06:21.500* :  we knew that that was a great thing to ask of anybody.
*06:21.500- 06:29.120* :  And I can't even imagine how proud her mother must be to have a child who would
*06:29.540- 06:33.920* :  grow up and be willing to do this completely selfless and giving act.
*06:34.320- 06:37.000* :  How difficult is it to get a match?
*06:37.220- 06:40.240* :  He was placed on a transplant list.
*06:40.600- 06:47.840* :  And so we knew that we could be waiting until he really was so sick that there was nobody
*06:48.440- 06:49.900* :  more sick than he is.
*06:51.140- 06:53.240* :  That was kind of a scary place to be.
*06:53.240- 06:59.460* :  We got to skip all of that and just kind of settle and breathe and we won't just be waiting
*06:59.460- 07:00.280* :  and waiting and waiting.
*07:00.280- 07:07.020* :  It was just an extra special thing that she's somebody who had a connection to him
*07:07.740- 07:11.400* :  and final words to Ezra, how do you feel about all this now?
*07:12.540- 07:19.480* :  Better. He's very carefree and just doing his thing and living his best little life,
*07:19.520- 07:21.160* :  but it was really sweet.
*07:21.160- 07:25.800* :  We ran into Miss Karissa and her mom at a local event.
*07:26.500- 07:29.980* :  He saw her and ran right up and gave her a big hug.
*07:30.460- 07:32.360* :  We told her she's stuck with him now.
*07:32.360- 07:33.220* :  She's like family.
*07:33.220- 07:38.400* :  So it'll be really neat that she can watch him grow and do well.
*07:42.600- 07:45.740* :  After all our years of sadness, this is truly surreal.
*07:45.980- 07:47.360* :  I got cold shivers.
*07:47.940- 07:53.040* :  The words of South African professor Linda Gail Becker on seeing the outcome of a new trial
*07:53.040- 07:54.560* :  into combating HIV.
*07:55.500- 07:59.880* :  According to the most recent figures, around 1.3 million people around the world
*07:59.880- 08:04.920* :  became infected with the virus in 2022, nearly half of them, women and girls.
*08:05.100- 08:10.520* :  Professor Becker, head of the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, has spent years working
*08:10.520- 08:14.240* :  with some of Africa's poorest people to try to reduce infections.
*08:14.960- 08:19.100* :  She told me why it was so significant that a new injection given twice a year
*08:19.500- 08:21.820* :  had been shown to give women total protection.
*08:22.560- 08:27.900* :  I think over the 30 years that we really have been battling HIV
*08:27.900- 08:34.320* :  in the Eastern Southern African region, we have not really seen incidents come down in young
*08:34.320- 08:39.560* :  woman and a primary prevention option that young women can use themselves
*08:40.360- 08:45.820* :  in an independent fashion in a discrete way has been something we haven't had in our hands.
*08:46.660- 08:53.220* :  Taking an oral pill daily turns out to be actually quite a lot of hard work for young people
*08:53.760- 09:01.060* :  as well for many social and structural reasons and so we just haven't seen the results we've
*09:01.060- 09:06.520* :  been hoping for that perhaps others have seen in other parts of the world and so this breakthrough
*09:06.520- 09:14.420* :  really is very very important because still today, 4,000 young women become infected with HIV
*09:14.800- 09:16.240* :  every week around the world.
*09:16.720- 09:20.600* :  And how did you feel when you saw the results of this trial?
*09:21.020- 09:26.020* :  Well, I want to say, you know, the zero just really made my hair stand on it because we just
*09:26.020- 09:32.080* :  haven't seen anything that effective in the whole of the AIDS epidemic.
*09:32.340- 09:35.100* :  When you say zero, you mean there were no infections?
*09:35.100- 09:37.840* :  Correct, 100% efficacy.
*09:38.360- 09:39.720* :  How surprised were you to see that?
*09:40.020- 09:47.960* :  Delighted. I guess we had many hopes that something that was injectable, that people could reliably
*09:47.960- 09:53.980* :  come and receive. We were very hopeful that we would get very good results, but I think seeing
*09:53.980- 09:59.920* :  100% efficacy is always a real bonus and one that we've extremely excited about.
*10:00.380- 10:06.500* :  Now, when we hear about new medical breakthroughs like this, it's often very expensive and it's
*10:06.500- 10:11.820* :  going to take a long time before people can really benefit from it. Where does this go from here?
*10:12.320- 10:18.720* :  Well, at this point, we have seen press statements from Gilead Science, who are the pharmaceutical
*10:18.820- 10:24.000* :  company that has been developing Lena Kappa via. First of all, they've said that they are
*10:24.000- 10:31.820* :  committed to global access. Secondly, that they will manufacture sufficiently that we don't have
*10:31.820- 10:38.920* :  a shortage in the short term. And they are prepared to offer the licenses to generic pharmaceutical
*10:39.060- 10:44.900* :  companies. And we know from past experience that once anti-retrovirals go to generic companies,
*10:44.900- 10:50.040* :  we do begin to see the price come down. I think there is a real sense of urgency.
*10:51.000- 10:55.500* :  Hopefully, in the next few months, this will be going to regulators.
*10:55.880- 11:00.560* :  And what will this mean for those communities that you've been working with in Africa for decades?
*11:00.940- 11:06.880* :  I think for them, it really is a mixture of excitement and relief. You know,
*11:07.340- 11:11.960* :  listeners might not appreciate that in a country where almost 8 million people
*11:11.960- 11:19.960* :  are living with HIV. You know, we all know somebody who's either living with the virus or, you know,
*11:20.200- 11:26.540* :  people are constantly aware that they may be at risk of acquiring the virus. And so having
*11:26.540- 11:33.400* :  something that is efficacious to the 16th is just huge. Linda Gail Becker, head of the Desmond
*11:33.400- 11:38.420* :  Tutu HIV Foundation and Professor of Medicine at the University of Cape Town.
*11:39.320- 11:44.820* :  Now, I hope you enjoyed our special edition from Finland recently, but did you know that every
*11:44.820- 11:50.540* :  year the country stages the world's biggest hobby horse championships. For the uninitiated,
*11:50.540- 11:56.020* :  a hobby horse is a children's toy made up of a wooden stick with a hand-crafted horse's head.
*11:56.660- 12:02.440* :  But enthusiasts, or hobbyists as they're known, take it a lot more seriously, with events like
*12:02.440- 12:08.880* :  dressage and jumping modelled on real equestrian activities. Lucy Archeson has been talking to
*12:08.920- 12:14.120* :  some of this year's participants. The child is now 140 centimeters high.
*12:17.020- 12:21.060* :  All right, finished championships. Let's go. Everybody's going. Everybody's coming together.
*12:21.060- 12:25.840* :  Everybody's having fun. There's always like this warm and very lovely and friendly atmosphere.
*12:27.740- 12:32.820* :  This event has captivated the nation, drawing participants of all ages who ride and perform
*12:32.820- 12:38.220* :  with their hand-crafted hobby horses. Meet Alec and Emi, two of the masterminds behind the event.
*12:38.760- 12:43.720* :  They started by a couple who decided that now is the time to make the championships,
*12:44.160- 12:49.580* :  and the first championships were held at a school and now it has grown over the years.
*12:49.840- 12:55.440* :  It's so nice to see the growth every year and the producers and arrangers of the championship,
*12:55.440- 13:00.840* :  the team is like amazing. Finland's hobby horse championships is the biggest event of
*13:00.840- 13:06.200* :  its kind in the world, with nearly 2,000 hobbyists competing this year, and it's not just
*13:06.200- 13:11.580* :  fins who are enchanted by the sport. In the championships, we had over 20 countries competing
*13:11.580- 13:16.940* :  this year. I think that that's really cool and it brings the sport to other countries as well.
*13:17.420- 13:21.500* :  Alecria came all the way from Argentina. Not only did she compete in the event,
*13:21.500- 13:26.140* :  but she also sold hand-crafted hobby horses. I'm from Argentina and we don't have a
*13:26.140- 13:31.920* :  little hobby horse in there. The traveling is exhausting, but it's the biggest hobby horse event
*13:31.980- 13:37.420* :  in the world and it's just like the goal to go there. Like I think every hobby horse's goal is
*13:37.420- 13:41.800* :  to go to the championships. I got to send to girls that were just like loving the horse,
*13:41.800- 13:46.080* :  they couldn't stop using it, they just fell in love with it and that was a huge highlight.
*13:46.660- 13:50.820* :  I had the chance to speak to Netta, a hobbyist who won the Holted Show pony ring.
*13:51.280- 13:56.420* :  I kind of knew that I was going to get good placements because I have already won the award of
*13:56.420- 14:01.380* :  hobby horse maker of the year 2023. Number first and second, they weren't announced yet,
*14:01.600- 14:06.820* :  and next to me is one of my most dearest hobby horse in France, Dakota, and we were looking at
*14:06.880- 14:11.700* :  each other like either one has just one. We even shook hands and hugged and we already started
*14:11.700- 14:14.900* :  to congratulate each other. I would have shared the win if I could.
*14:16.780- 14:21.820* :  Hobby horse might seem quirky and unusual to some, but competitions like this bring people together
*14:21.820- 14:27.960* :  fostering a sense of community. Hobby horses are for everyone, I think, a one who wants to experience
*14:27.960- 14:32.900* :  the community and do something fun. The atmosphere is so warm, it just makes it so unique.
*14:32.900- 14:38.100* :  Never be afraid of trying something new because you never know what you will like and what you
*14:38.100- 14:43.120* :  what type of hobbies you will fall in love with. Always have an open mind and try everything.
*14:44.020- 14:48.420* :  With colourful handmade hobby horses, elaborate routines and boundless enthusiasm,
*14:48.420- 14:52.120* :  the hobby horse championships in Finland are more than just a spectacle.
*14:52.120- 14:57.580* :  They're a testament to the power of community and the joy of pursuing a passion no matter how niche.
*15:01.240- 15:02.240* :  Lucy Archeson
*15:10.340- 15:11.940* :  And still to come on the happy pods?
*15:12.580- 15:18.360* :  We're making tourism that's ethno tourism, an indigenous tourism, telling our history,
*15:18.580- 15:22.180* :  our past, our present, and also what we see in our future.
*15:22.900- 15:26.200* :  A new type of tourism helping indigenous people in Colombia.
*15:35.840- 15:36.200* :  Ryan Reynolds
*15:36.200- 15:40.220* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mid-Mobile. With the price of just about everything going up during inflation,
*15:40.220- 15:45.400* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,
*15:45.400- 15:48.940* :  which is apparently a thing. Mid-Mobile, I'm living in Premier Wireless,

*16:41.460- 16:45.440* :  Now, football is one of the things that can make me happy, though, of course,
*16:45.540- 16:49.060* :  as an England fan, there's always a chance of disappointment as well.
*16:49.680- 16:55.260* :  But for Georgia, the final group game of the European Championships brought unconfined joy,
*16:55.260- 17:00.860* :  as their 2-0 shot win over Portugal meant they reached the last 16 in the knockout stages
*17:00.860- 17:05.940* :  in their first ever major tournament. Tomorrow Edgar, from the capital to Bliese,
*17:05.940- 17:10.500* :  sent us this voice note about what it means for her and for Georgia an identity.
*17:19.720- 17:25.020* :  And it's so much bigger than football, because it just changes the paradigm,
*17:25.020- 17:30.380* :  the narrative of our story, it changes the whole national mindset,
*17:30.380- 17:34.040* :  because we always have this like, yes, we're brave and yes, we're tough.
*17:34.180- 17:36.580* :  We always lose, but we're going to go fighting.
*17:37.680- 17:40.520* :  There's this mindset that we know we're never going to win.
*17:40.800- 17:46.540* :  And I'm thinking about all those Georgian kids who are going to now grow up with this idea.
*17:46.540- 17:51.680* :  No, we can't just just win. We win against Portugal.
*17:52.340- 17:55.840* :  We get around now, though, kicking off and leaving the pitch,
*17:56.140- 17:59.460* :  because of how annoyed he is, by how great we are.
*18:00.800- 18:08.480* :  It was close to missing impossible, but Georgia have succeeded when no one thought they could.
*18:09.480- 18:14.460* :  It was the first time in my lifetime I could see my national flag on BBC,
*18:15.360- 18:20.120* :  and it's not about some catastrophic event that's happening there.
*18:20.120- 18:25.180* :  We are in use in a positive way. I can't let that come.
*18:25.180- 18:29.360* :  Concentrate today. I'm just, it's incredible.
*18:30.200- 18:32.820* :  With apologies to Portugal and thanks to Tamara.
*18:32.820- 18:38.040* :  And if you'd like to share something that's made you happy, send us an email or a voice note
*18:38.040- 18:41.860* :  to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*18:43.000- 18:48.580* :  For more than 500 years, the indigenous people of Northern Colombia have lived in relative isolation,
*18:48.700- 18:52.260* :  with visitors sometimes seen as unwelcome outsiders.
*18:53.040- 18:57.720* :  But a new initiative is allowing these tribes to benefit from the money brought in by foreign
*18:57.720- 19:03.300* :  travellers. It's an example of what's known as ethno-tourism, which encourages visitors to
*19:03.300- 19:07.280* :  respect local communities, while exploring and understanding their cultures.
*19:07.800- 19:10.160* :  Sophie Smith has been to meet some of those involved.
*19:13.120- 19:18.660* :  We're walking up this year in Havada, and on the left,
*19:19.640- 19:25.020* :  hera mountains, on the right, hera mountains. I'm quite out of breath,
*19:26.020- 19:28.600* :  because it's a very steep walk.
*19:31.640- 19:36.140* :  In Northern Colombia, small groups of western tourists trek for four days to reach the
*19:36.140- 19:40.600* :  lost city, nestled in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada to Santa Marta.
*19:41.460- 19:48.480* :  Here, 1200 meters above sea level, the Arwhacker, Weewer, Kogi and Cancun Amos make their homes.
*19:49.040- 19:52.200* :  This land has not always been recognized as their territory, though.
*19:52.600- 19:56.360* :  For centuries, the tribes have suffered at the hands of colonizers,
*19:56.360- 20:01.380* :  guerrilla soldiers and drug traffickers, but the Sierra Nevada, like the rest of Colombia,
*20:01.380- 20:05.620* :  is changing, and so-called ethno-tourism is playing its part.
*20:07.120- 20:12.860* :  Jose Benjamin Gutierrez Villafana is an Arwhacking guide who works for Weewer Tours,
*20:12.860- 20:19.240* :  the first and only tour operator to be entirely owned and operated by indigenous people in these
*20:19.240- 20:19.820* :  mountains.
*20:20.300- 20:28.620* :  The history of Colombia is a history with a lot of conflict, riddled with war and drug trafficking.
*20:29.340- 20:33.380* :  For example, in this village, everyone used to work on drug farms or in drug labs.
*20:34.380- 20:37.240* :  Now the people are tour guides that are chefs for tour groups.
*20:37.240- 20:40.260* :  This is a proper tourism, an indigenous tourism.
*20:40.260- 20:42.700* :  It's totally different when we talk about ourselves.
*20:42.700- 20:48.500* :  So it's telling our history, our past, our present, and also what we see in our future.
*20:50.580- 20:53.640* :  Tourism has not only brought employment and protection to the people,
*20:53.640- 20:56.560* :  but also to the biodiversity of the region.
*20:57.120- 21:00.680* :  For the Arwhackens, the Sierra Nevada is the heart of the world.
*21:01.080- 21:05.340* :  They believe it's their duty to protect the land from the people who come to exploit
*21:05.340- 21:10.940* :  its rich minerals, and tourism allows them to show its beauty and its worth to others.
*21:14.120- 21:17.560* :  The Sierra Nevada, above all, is a unique mountain in all of the world.
*21:18.000- 21:21.200* :  For us, the Arwhacker, it has minerals that are like a person.
*21:21.860- 21:26.220* :  Mother Earth has gold, petrol, minerals, like an organ of our bodies.
*21:27.220- 21:30.740* :  So if we take these minerals, after time we will destroy everything.
*21:30.780- 21:33.760* :  We'll destroy the rivers, we'll destroy everything.
*21:34.160- 21:39.120* :  I think it's very important for others to come and learn about Mother Earth,
*21:39.120- 21:42.540* :  the Mother of Nature, and how important it is to protect nature.
*21:42.840- 21:47.160* :  While the Sierra Nevada has seen great progress, there are still changes to be made.
*21:47.880- 21:51.660* :  A new government scheme uses government resources to buy back land
*21:51.660- 21:55.560* :  currently owned by non-indigenous people on the mountain and return it.
*21:56.620- 22:00.040* :  This scheme allows the people to move to the lower parts of the mountain,
*22:00.040- 22:03.400* :  and gives them the guarantee they'll be able to remain here where they belong.
*22:05.820- 22:10.220* :  For my part, I'm always very happy to meet new people every day on this trek.
*22:10.680- 22:14.360* :  It's very important for me to be able to meet you and to share the experience with you.
*22:14.760- 22:18.660* :  You're taking our words, our history to somewhere in the world I would never be able to visit.
*22:19.420- 22:22.240* :  But for me, it's very moving to be able to share it with you,
*22:22.580- 22:24.640* :  and know that you will share the history of our land.
*22:27.140- 22:28.720* :  That report by Sophie Smith.
*22:29.560- 22:33.620* :  Now to a remarkable exhibition of modern art rescued from Ukraine,
*22:33.620- 22:35.380* :  even as the bombs were falling.
*22:35.760- 22:39.220* :  Nikki Cardwell has been along to the Royal Academy in London to see it,
*22:39.580- 22:43.000* :  and hear about the many challenges that needed to be overcome to save these
*22:43.000- 22:44.640* :  priceless paintings and sculptures.
*22:45.900- 22:47.700* :  So we are in the first room of the exhibition.
*22:47.700- 22:51.760* :  That cut here, Dennis, is one of the curators of In the Eye of the Storm.
*22:51.980- 22:55.400* :  I want to show you this relief by Vasily Irminov.
*22:55.460- 22:59.000* :  We're standing in front of a carved layered and painted relief.
*22:59.000- 23:03.240* :  The raised and lowered sections throw shadows that give it dimension.
*23:03.700- 23:06.380* :  We change its appearance depending on where you're standing.
*23:07.000- 23:07.640* :  It's stunning.
*23:07.740- 23:11.040* :  There is metal, there is wood, there is combination of textures,
*23:11.040- 23:13.420* :  but it's extremely to self-portrait,
*23:14.040- 23:16.540* :  and so there is still an element of figuration to it,
*23:16.540- 23:19.820* :  but it's extremely textural throughout all the different angles.
*23:20.080- 23:21.480* :  I'm exactly, yeah, I know.
*23:21.640- 23:22.940* :  That's why it's in a box, presumably.
*23:22.940- 23:25.220* :  Exactly, you're not the only one who has a touch on it.
*23:25.220- 23:30.320* :  Instead of being on display, these works could have been locked away in a cellar in Kiev.
*23:30.860- 23:33.440* :  My name is Francesca Tusson Bonemiteza,
*23:33.620- 23:37.880* :  and I am the founder and chair of TBA-21,
*23:37.880- 23:40.940* :  which is at a contemporary art foundation in Madrid.
*23:41.300- 23:44.700* :  She says it became clear that cultural spaces were being targeted.
*23:45.160- 23:50.060* :  It became very obvious maybe get the paintings out would be a priority,
*23:50.060- 23:57.160* :  but Zelensky was so determined never to show any possible defeatist attitudes
*23:57.680- 24:00.000* :  that taking things out of the country for safety
*24:00.000- 24:02.320* :  sent completely the wrong signal.
*24:02.580- 24:06.320* :  At this point, the art historian Constantine Akinsha stepped in
*24:06.740- 24:08.860* :  while Francesca dealt with matters in Madrid,
*24:09.320- 24:11.640* :  he set about persuading President Zelensky
*24:12.000- 24:14.200* :  and working out how to transport everything.
*24:14.400- 24:16.460* :  There is no insurer in this war.
*24:16.660- 24:19.380* :  We'll be ready to ensure anything moving through Ukraine.
*24:19.380- 24:24.160* :  So we got support of the presidential administration of Mr. Zelensky.
*24:24.160- 24:27.640* :  We got military convoy and state guarantee,
*24:27.640- 24:31.600* :  and we started to move this art to the Polish border.
*24:31.840- 24:33.800* :  And that's when the challenges really began.
*24:34.060- 24:37.380* :  We were moving this in November of 2022,
*24:37.700- 24:40.240* :  and during that period, Russian constant,
*24:40.240- 24:42.580* :  we were born in Kiev on Mondays,
*24:42.680- 24:45.060* :  and we decided that we will be smarter than them
*24:45.080- 24:46.500* :  and we will move it on Tuesday.
*24:46.700- 24:52.820* :  Of course, to our luck, this year we became the most intensive Russian
*24:52.820- 24:55.540* :  missile attack on the full territory of Ukraine.
*24:55.740- 24:57.140* :  With missiles flying overhead,
*24:57.140- 25:00.500* :  the convoy of trucks made its way to the Polish border
*25:01.060- 25:02.260* :  only to find it closed.
*25:02.760- 25:04.800* :  They were stuck for days in Madrid.
*25:05.220- 25:06.860* :  Francesca started making calls.
*25:07.160- 25:09.920* :  Very luckily, Ukrainian ambassador in Madrid
*25:09.920- 25:12.480* :  used to be the ambassador in Poland in Warsaw
*25:13.040- 25:14.980* :  and knew everybody and all the government.
*25:15.160- 25:18.740* :  And he moved mountains to get that border re-open,
*25:18.800- 25:19.900* :  to get that truck out.
*25:20.120- 25:22.680* :  I was just crying for joy when they got into Poland.
*25:22.680- 25:24.160* :  That was just such a relief.
*25:24.320- 25:27.460* :  The plan is for this exhibition to continually tour the world
*25:27.460- 25:30.020* :  until it's safe for the works to return to Ukraine.
*25:30.060- 25:34.120* :  For Konstantin Akinsha, who planned and helped transport the works,
*25:34.600- 25:36.580* :  seeing this exhibition has been emotional.
*25:37.040- 25:39.340* :  I'm very proud that they're here,
*25:39.340- 25:41.880* :  that people can see them, and that they're safe.
*25:42.420- 25:44.400* :  Art historian Konstantin Akinsha,
*25:44.400- 25:46.440* :  ending that report by Nikki Cardwell.
*25:47.220- 25:49.920* :  Now, maybe this should be our theme tune.
*25:56.700- 25:59.820* :  It was sung most famously by Judy Garland,
*25:59.940- 26:02.460* :  but that particular performance was actually by a woman
*26:02.460- 26:06.360* :  who's found fame for her impersonation of the American star.
*26:07.020- 26:09.780* :  It all started when an agent saw her singing online
*26:09.780- 26:12.340* :  to cheer up friends and family during COVID.
*26:13.000- 26:17.300* :  Since then, Debbie Wildman has performed at New York's Carnegie Hall twice,
*26:17.700- 26:18.720* :  which is recorded in an album,
*26:19.140- 26:21.840* :  and now has a show opening in London's West End.
*26:22.420- 26:24.480* :  Debbie told Nulam a govern that her day job
*26:24.480- 26:27.400* :  had stopped the newfound success going to her head.
*26:27.880- 26:32.420* :  I did this amazing show at Carnegie Hall in December in New York,
*26:32.980- 26:36.320* :  and then four days later, I was taking photographs of people's pupils.
*26:37.100- 26:39.460* :  So, you know, I can never get too fancy.
*26:40.780- 26:43.080* :  But did you want to do it then professionally?
*26:43.700- 26:45.860* :  Oh, I did. I mean, yes, I had dreams.
*26:45.900- 26:49.040* :  I didn't happen. I had to get a job.
*26:49.340- 26:51.760* :  And that was that, you know, I got married, had a little girl,
*26:51.760- 26:55.960* :  and in the pandemic, just to cheer up my friends,
*26:56.140- 26:58.920* :  I made some videos on Facebook.
*27:02.260- 27:03.260* :  And I wouldn't have done it otherwise,
*27:03.260- 27:05.440* :  because I would have thought it was, you know, showy offy.
*27:05.680- 27:08.500* :  And on day three, I posted to Judy Arlen's song,
*27:08.840- 27:16.100* :  and all because of the man that got away.
*27:17.580- 27:20.100* :  I tacked it to a Judy Garland Facebook group,
*27:20.180- 27:21.900* :  and people just started watching,
*27:21.940- 27:23.260* :  and it was a big surprise,
*27:23.260- 27:24.520* :  and it went a bit viral,
*27:24.520- 27:27.580* :  and then an agent from America contacted me.
*27:27.820- 27:30.340* :  And I was making these videos on my phone, in my car,
*27:30.340- 27:32.620* :  because we had a neighbour at the time who'd hammer on the wall.
*27:32.960- 27:35.160* :  It's been amazing, you know, I'm here.
*27:35.560- 27:37.480* :  I mean, some people are calling us uncanny.
*27:37.920- 27:39.160* :  You've got the whole package.
*27:39.660- 27:42.260* :  It is speaking in the way she speaks, too.
*27:42.740- 27:48.680* :  Now, today, it is Mother's Day.
*27:49.000- 27:51.100* :  And, you know, we've all had them.
*27:51.840- 27:54.360* :  So, we can, you know.
*27:54.760- 27:57.660* :  What was, I don't know, the fascination with her, in particular?
*27:57.920- 28:00.940* :  Well, I saw her first when I was about six years old,
*28:01.380- 28:02.720* :  and I've just always been a fan,
*28:02.720- 28:04.340* :  and then when I was like 12,
*28:05.140- 28:07.380* :  I discovered I could do a sort of impersonation,
*28:07.380- 28:11.180* :  singing wise of her, and I did it for my grandmas.
*28:11.180- 28:12.840* :  Hey, Nana, listen to this.
*28:13.020- 28:14.260* :  I'll give you a little burst.
*28:15.140- 28:16.060* :  I love a piano.
*28:16.140- 28:17.500* :  I love a piano.
*28:18.020- 28:20.100* :  I love to hear somebody play.
*28:20.300- 28:23.140* :  Up on a piano, a grand piano.
*28:23.820- 28:25.020* :  Let's talk about Carnegie Hall.
*28:25.160- 28:26.300* :  What was that like?
*28:26.520- 28:27.640* :  It was amazing.
*28:27.640- 28:29.860* :  It was honestly just crazy.
*28:29.860- 28:31.720* :  You know, I was, what, 38?
*28:32.280- 28:35.460* :  Yeah, I thought my chance was gone, you know.
*28:35.940- 28:38.660* :  And, yeah, for the first time you ever sing in New York,
*28:38.740- 28:40.740* :  for it to be at Carnegie Hall, it's a bit mad.
*28:40.740- 28:44.080* :  It was just such an amazing night.
*28:44.640- 28:47.380* :  We recorded an album as well, which was nuts.
*28:47.800- 28:49.400* :  It's imagined songs.
*28:49.520- 28:52.540* :  So it's songs that Judy never actually got the chance to do,
*28:53.200- 28:54.960* :  done in a style as if she did.
*29:01.040- 29:03.400* :  And we've worked out these arrangements of songs
