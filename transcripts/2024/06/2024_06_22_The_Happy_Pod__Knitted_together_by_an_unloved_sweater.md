*01:16.500- 01:22.180* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 22nd of June, how a small
*01:22.180- 01:26.920* :  act of kindness from someone you've never met can make the world seem brighter.
*01:27.300- 01:32.960* :  It just felt like this perfect serendipitous moment where the universe tells you I care
*01:32.960- 01:34.940* :  about you and other people care about you.
*01:34.980- 01:38.180* :  I just kind of feel a little bit overwhelmed by how good people are.
*01:38.840- 01:45.120* :  A special radio program to help those celebrating Midwinter in Antarctica feel closer to their
*01:45.120- 01:45.760* :  loved ones.
*01:46.260- 01:51.900* :  Merry Midwinter George, we are missing you very much, I can't wait for you to come home.
*01:52.160- 01:55.140* :  I can run, happy Midwinter, I can't wait for you to come back.
*01:55.360- 01:56.440* :  Does he want to take you home or something?
*01:56.960- 01:57.620* :  Okay, good.
*01:57.620- 01:58.760* :  Okay, good.
*01:59.260- 01:59.600* :  Okay, good.
*02:00.480- 02:03.020* :  Plus, welcome to the Aristotle.
*02:03.400- 02:08.700* :  Being able to combine something such as like a popular music icon like PaySwift with
*02:09.160- 02:14.240* :  seismology would be a great way to see how effectively science can be communicated.
*02:18.380- 02:23.580* :  The scientific study looking at earthquakes caused by a global superstar's fans.
*02:24.300- 02:29.300* :  Also in this podcast, we hear how artificial intelligence could help us understand what
*02:29.300- 02:30.920* :  our dogs are trying to tell us.
*02:31.080- 02:36.000* :  And a sort of pair of eyes, you know, staring out from this gap, you know, amazing octopus
*02:36.000- 02:40.720* :  that sort of made a home and as it came out, it sort of curled the tentacle around one
*02:40.720- 02:43.380* :  of the faces of the pieces and it was incredible.
*02:44.000- 02:49.400* :  The underwater sculpture exhibitions providing new homes for endangered species.
*02:55.460- 03:00.800* :  Now, here at the happy pod, we love hearing about things that bring you joy and how small
*03:00.800- 03:03.240* :  acts of kindness can make a big difference.
*03:03.900- 03:05.500* :  Well, this story includes both.
*03:05.940- 03:11.100* :  It started with Celia Robbins, an American woman living in Berlin, posting on X about
*03:11.100- 03:16.620* :  a question her daughter had asked and ended with her receiving a gift and making a new
*03:16.720- 03:17.020* :  friend.
*03:17.680- 03:20.380* :  Stephanie's acquiescent spoke to Celia to find out more.
*03:20.780- 03:26.320* :  I think the way that I posed the question on Twitter was, you know, my daughter asked
*03:26.320- 03:28.080* :  do you have any regrets, Mom?
*03:28.820- 03:33.820* :  And while I know she was asking that on a philosophical level, my mind immediately went to a puffing
*03:33.820- 03:35.460* :  sweater that I had seen in Iceland.
*03:36.360- 03:41.440* :  And I kind of just expressed that it had been three years and I still regretted not buying
*03:41.440- 03:41.680* :  it.
*03:42.740- 03:45.360* :  And then I don't have my phone for several hours.
*03:45.360- 03:50.840* :  I looked at my phone and it was just kind of going off.
*03:51.120- 03:55.140* :  Someone had posted an all cap locks letters, Celia.
*03:55.840- 03:59.340* :  Did you see this post or did you see this comment?
*04:00.160- 04:05.360* :  And it was a woman commenting below a gentleman named Dave who is now my friend.
*04:05.360- 04:11.880* :  He is so nice where Dave had commented and said, my regret is that I bought this exact
*04:11.880- 04:16.080* :  sweater for my wife and she's never worn it in two years.
*04:16.280- 04:20.960* :  He did talk to his wife and she was very kind and she basically was like, I would love
*04:20.960- 04:24.480* :  to give this to this woman if it would make her happy because I haven't worn it.
*04:24.740- 04:30.880* :  It just felt like this perfect, serendipitous moment where the universe tells you I care
*04:30.880- 04:34.820* :  about you and other people care about you and I just kind of feel a little bit overwhelmed
*04:34.820- 04:36.900* :  by how good people are.
*04:37.340- 04:38.200* :  That is just beautiful.
*04:38.200- 04:44.600* :  And not only have you got that sweater hanging in your closet now, you've also made a
*04:44.600- 04:45.960* :  friend in Dave as well.
*04:46.460- 04:47.380* :  Yeah, he's my friend.
*04:47.380- 04:52.220* :  And when he talked about mailing the package to me, I said, Dave, if it's easier for you,
*04:52.260- 04:55.020* :  you can mail it to my mom in South Carolina.
*04:55.020- 04:58.440* :  We're going to come visit this summer, but whatever is easier for you.
*04:58.780- 05:00.440* :  And he said, just give me your address.
*05:00.600- 05:01.560* :  I'm going to figure it out.
*05:01.640- 05:04.060* :  I went to pay him and he was like, nope, this is on me.
*05:04.240- 05:06.640* :  Basically, he said it just felt so good to be nice.
*05:07.500- 05:11.360* :  So it was like another example to me of just kindness.
*05:11.360- 05:13.540* :  And he said, hey, when I come to Berlin, you could take me out.
*05:13.700- 05:18.560* :  And we said deal, that is the best deal because we would love to meet you and just thank
*05:18.560- 05:19.220* :  you in person.
*05:19.620- 05:24.580* :  I mean, this time you were at the receiving end of this kindness.
*05:24.720- 05:29.900* :  Has it has a whole kind of experience made you think a bit about how you want to pay
*05:29.900- 05:31.540* :  kindness forward, I guess?
*05:31.920- 05:32.200* :  Yes.
*05:32.200- 05:32.700* :  Of course.
*05:33.180- 05:34.620* :  I have four kids.
*05:35.460- 05:41.480* :  And I always try to teach my kids and show my kids that when we're kind, kindness comes
*05:41.480- 05:42.380* :  back to us.
*05:42.680- 05:47.560* :  I think that's been like the most amazing part of all this is that my daughter was like,
*05:47.580- 05:48.520* :  mama, not surprised.
*05:48.520- 05:49.340* :  This happened to you.
*05:49.540- 05:50.740* :  You're so nice to everyone.
*05:51.340- 05:55.860* :  I'm glad that she could see through Dave's example, like I tried to be positive.
*05:56.740- 05:59.360* :  And I was met back with positivity.
*05:59.360- 06:03.380* :  So it just kind of makes me want to continue that cycle of positivity.
*06:03.380- 06:05.160* :  So like, what can I do for someone?
*06:05.720- 06:07.460* :  What can we do for people we don't know?
*06:07.460- 06:14.240* :  I feel like so often we give kindness to people who know us and that's kind of expected
*06:14.280- 06:15.380* :  and that's encouraged.
*06:15.700- 06:23.080* :  But just absolute kindness without receiving anything, it kind of makes me want to just
*06:23.080- 06:27.960* :  be not only kind of people that I know, which I already tried to do, but kind of people
*06:27.960- 06:28.660* :  I don't know.
*06:28.900- 06:37.260* :  And be more cognizant of the fact that we have the ability to just really affect positive
*06:37.820- 06:37.840* :  change.
*06:38.240- 06:41.060* :  I've just had so many people say like, we're so excited for you.
*06:41.300- 06:47.660* :  And I mean, I as a human feel like loved and edified by this whole experience.
*06:48.260- 06:51.300* :  Celia Robbins talking there to Stephanie's Accreson.
*06:51.920- 06:56.100* :  We'd love to hear about the small acts of kindness from strangers that have made you
*06:56.100- 06:56.500* :  a day.
*06:56.620- 07:01.920* :  Send us a voice note or an email to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*07:03.020- 07:08.260* :  Now in Antarctica, temperatures are below freezing and sunrise is weeks away.
*07:08.800- 07:13.820* :  But the three research stations of the British Antarctic Survey continue to operate through
*07:13.820- 07:15.240* :  the long dark season.
*07:15.800- 07:20.720* :  And the people living there have just celebrated Midwinter's Day on June 21st.
*07:20.880- 07:26.980* :  They have a meal, they have presents and a special Antarctic Midwinter program from us here
*07:26.980- 07:27.600* :  at the BBC.
*07:27.600- 07:34.660* :  It's broadcast to a captive audience of just 46, plus that is a few thousand penguins
*07:35.280- 07:36.160* :  as Rebecca would report.
*07:36.740- 07:39.480* :  This is the BBC World Service calling Antarctica.
*07:39.540- 07:45.880* :  When the Midwinter broadcast started decades ago, shortwave radio was the only means of communication,
*07:46.580- 07:48.460* :  but technology has changed.
*07:48.780- 07:52.240* :  I'm literally looking at snowy mountains right in front of me.
*07:52.600- 07:55.620* :  Temperatures have gotten to minus figures, finally.
*07:56.220- 08:01.640* :  And there's two king penguin chicks right outside my window with one of their parents.
*08:01.900- 08:07.080* :  That's Nadia Frontier, a marine biologist speaking clear as day from King Edward Point
*08:07.080- 08:08.540* :  on South Georgia Island.
*08:09.200- 08:14.260* :  She's won a 46 scientists and support staff working at British research stations in the
*08:14.260- 08:14.900* :  Antarctic.
*08:15.560- 08:21.080* :  No sunlight is at its coldest this time of year, and those stationed there face months of
*08:21.080- 08:27.760* :  total isolation, a part of course from the company of tens of thousands of seals, penguins
*08:27.840- 08:28.860* :  and albatross.
*08:29.160- 08:35.520* :  We are currently in the middle of winter, so we've got a few hours of twilight in the middle
*08:35.520- 08:39.360* :  of the day, and then for the rest of the time it's pretty dark here.
*08:39.600- 08:44.060* :  But for scientists like Ali Clement there, they've just reached a turning point.
*08:44.560- 08:51.480* :  Inside winter, the 21st of June, the shortest darkest day, celebrated a bit like Christmas.
*08:51.540- 08:57.640* :  The tradition is to have a special meal, exchange gifts and settle down to watch this.
*09:04.800- 09:11.540* :  The thing, a 1982 horror film about an alien monster that terrorises an Antarctic base.
*09:12.220- 09:17.500* :  Not the most cheery of viewing, but then it's time for the BBC's Midwinter broadcast.
*09:18.220- 09:22.500* :  They all gather around radios and listen on special shortwave frequencies.
*09:23.240- 09:27.140* :  There are song requests and messages from family and friends at home.
*09:27.400- 09:33.260* :  Merry Midwinter George, we are missing you very much, I can't wait for you to come home,
*09:33.340- 09:35.620* :  but I am so, so proud of you.
*09:36.080- 09:40.700* :  Hi Cameron, happy midwinter, I can't believe it's been a whole year since we spent midsummer
*09:40.800- 09:42.240* :  on our honeymoon in Iceland.
*09:42.660- 09:43.860* :  I can't wait for you to come back.
*09:43.860- 09:47.840* :  This message is for Ben Stimson from his mum and dad in Queensland, Australia.
*09:48.180- 09:50.600* :  If ever there was a job made for you, Ben, you're in it.
*09:50.820- 09:51.880* :  Is he going to take you home, something?
*09:52.360- 09:53.020* :  Okay, good.
*09:53.020- 09:54.180* :  Okay, good.
*09:54.680- 09:55.040* :  Okay, good.
*09:55.320- 09:56.840* :  Have a wonderful adventure, Vic.
*09:57.120- 09:59.440* :  We miss you a lot, and Phoebe, we see you.
*10:00.180- 10:06.260* :  Welcome messages from people and pets that despite the kilometers of frozen landscape between them,
*10:06.760- 10:09.020* :  make home feel that little bit closer.
*10:10.100- 10:12.880* :  And happy midwinter from us here on the happy pod,
*10:13.260- 10:17.660* :  and to hear the whole wonderful podcast, search BBC The Documentary,
*10:17.660- 10:19.740* :  wherever you find this podcast.
*10:21.080- 10:24.680* :  Now, can you tell the difference in mood between this dog...
*10:24.680- 10:29.420* :  ...and this one...
*10:29.460- 10:33.620* :  ...and this dog...
*10:34.160- 10:38.100* :  Well, if you couldn't tell that the first dog Kira was playing,
*10:38.100- 10:41.600* :  while the second lassie was angrily barking at a stranger,
*10:42.040- 10:44.540* :  artificial intelligence might be able to help you.
*10:45.020- 10:48.800* :  Researchers have been using it to interpret what dogs are trying to tell us.
*10:49.080- 10:53.940* :  They gathered the barks, growls, and whimpers of 74 dogs in a variety of contexts,
*10:53.940- 10:59.080* :  and they fed that into existing computer models trained on human speech.
*10:59.760- 11:03.400* :  Andrew Peach spoke to the lead author of the study at the University of Michigan,
*11:03.400- 11:05.040* :  Artem Absilioff.
*11:05.580- 11:08.140* :  We investigated four different components.
*11:08.180- 11:11.340* :  So, first one was gender, which was the hardest task.
*11:11.620- 11:15.320* :  Second one is the whether dog, for instance, is aggressive or playful.
*11:16.260- 11:20.160* :  The third one is the individual dog, whether we can recognize individual dogs.
*11:20.740- 11:22.780* :  And the fourth one was the breed.
*11:22.900- 11:26.000* :  I'm clearly not doing a scientific study here,
*11:26.000- 11:30.680* :  but I think I could tell if a dog was angry by the way it was barking, no?
*11:30.900- 11:33.620* :  That's true. I guess people are very good.
*11:33.700- 11:36.900* :  But you know, we had several thousand years to live with dogs together,
*11:36.900- 11:38.380* :  so we understand them pretty well.
*11:38.880- 11:40.520* :  But it's much harder for the computer.
*11:40.520- 11:44.900* :  So therefore, it's just a question of having what lots and lots of samples
*11:44.900- 11:47.380* :  teaching the computer gradually what they mean.
*11:47.620- 11:48.500* :  That's exactly right.
*11:48.780- 11:53.540* :  Tell me about how you can determine a dog's gender or breed from its bark,
*11:53.680- 11:55.340* :  because I have to say I couldn't do that.
*11:56.160- 11:59.600* :  So gender, in fact, we show in our studies, gender is very hard.
*12:00.080- 12:01.420* :  But the breed, I would say,
*12:01.420- 12:04.380* :  different breeds have different variations than peach, for instance.
*12:05.060- 12:06.060* :  What use is all this?
*12:06.220- 12:10.020* :  Personally, I hope in the short term, we might be able to recognize, let's say,
*12:10.020- 12:13.420* :  anxiety dogs, so help humans understand, hey,
*12:13.420- 12:18.240* :  something is going wrong with my dog, or I don't know, with dogs and shelters, for instance.
*12:18.920- 12:22.120* :  And this would help hopefully improve the well-being of dogs.
*12:22.940- 12:28.220* :  Yes, I can see that maybe you could get your dog to bark into your smartphone
*12:28.220- 12:29.360* :  or something like that.
*12:29.360- 12:32.740* :  And then the technology would be able to tell you a bit about the dog
*12:32.740- 12:34.220* :  and tell you if there was anything wrong.
*12:34.580- 12:37.640* :  This is probably more long-term approach, indeed, having an app.
*12:37.680- 12:40.600* :  But I think a lot of information also comes from the visual.
*12:41.160- 12:43.820* :  In a long term, you also want to add visual information.
*12:43.820- 12:48.180* :  Let's say we can look at the tail of a dog, we can look at the ears of a dog, and so on.
*12:48.280- 12:49.900* :  Are you a dog person yourself, Adam?
*12:50.120- 12:51.540* :  Yes, yes, very much.
*12:51.660- 12:55.800* :  I have a dog called Nova, called Nutriver, and she's now four years old.
*12:55.920- 13:00.780* :  Okay, and I bet you can tell exactly what mood she's in and what her needs are
*13:00.780- 13:02.080* :  from the way she barks at you.
*13:02.400- 13:03.780* :  Yes, that's true.
*13:03.860- 13:05.800* :  If she barks at me, she's already at bed mood.
*13:07.980- 13:10.120* :  She means she wants something, or she's unhappy about something.
*13:10.500- 13:11.200* :  Yes.
*13:12.120- 13:16.280* :  Fascinating stuff, and it may be that some dogs might be easier to understand
*13:16.280- 13:17.140* :  than others.
*13:17.580- 13:20.620* :  That was Adam, Absilio, speaking there, to Andrew Peach.
*13:21.900- 13:25.240* :  Now, have you ever done so hard you made the earth move?
*13:25.700- 13:29.000* :  Well, that's what fans of Taylor Swift have been doing during her tour,
*13:29.000- 13:30.740* :  currently taking place across Europe.
*13:31.280- 13:34.080* :  Seismic activity has been detected at several shows,
*13:34.520- 13:37.840* :  and our researchers in Ireland are hoping to use her concerts there
*13:38.220- 13:39.840* :  to make science more popular.
*13:40.340- 13:44.340* :  The happy pod's very own swifty, Holly Gibbs, has been finding out more.
*13:47.640- 13:49.140* :  Welcome to the eras tour!
*13:51.060- 13:54.000* :  Over the past year, swifties across the world have been
*13:54.000- 13:57.780* :  flocking to the eras tour to see their favourite superstar.
*13:57.960- 13:59.080* :  People come up to me and they'd be like,
*13:59.400- 14:02.700* :  you're going to just do a show with all the albums in it.
*14:03.100- 14:05.660* :  And I was like, yeah, it's going to be called the eras tour.
*14:06.540- 14:07.000* :  See you there.
*14:07.920- 14:13.380* :  But what they may not realise is that their enthusiasm has literally been making the earth move.
*14:16.540- 14:20.260* :  Last July, when Taylor Swift was performing at the Moomin Field Stadium in Seattle,
*14:20.780- 14:25.040* :  it was reported that fans caused the equivalent of a 2.3 magnitude earthquake
*14:25.040- 14:27.120* :  by jumping, dancing and singing.
*14:27.140- 14:30.720* :  And earlier this month, Swifties and Scotland did the same.
*14:31.280- 14:36.100* :  Seismic activity was detected up to 6 kilometres away from the Moomin Field Stadium in Edinburgh.
*14:41.000- 14:44.220* :  Three songs generated the most movement, including her opener,
*14:44.220- 14:46.900* :  cruel summer, and the song, Shamping Problems.
*14:50.120- 14:55.440* :  Experts say the activity peaked at 160 beats per minute during the song Ready For It.
*14:59.540- 15:03.600* :  The crowd created about 80 kilowatts of power during the song,
*15:04.020- 15:06.420* :  which is the equivalent of more than 10 car batteries.
*15:10.000- 15:14.120* :  The searches in Dublin are hoping fans will also make the earth move when Taylor Swift
*15:14.360- 15:16.260* :  performs three shows there at the end of June.
*15:17.000- 15:20.960* :  Eleanor Dunn is a PhD student at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.
*15:20.960- 15:25.840* :  She is set up a project called Swift Wake to try to mix pop culture and science.
*15:26.320- 15:31.660* :  Being able to combine something such as a popular music icon like Taylor Swift with
*15:31.660- 15:37.220* :  seismology would be a great way to see how effectively science can be communicated.
*15:38.140- 15:42.020* :  I would love to kind of make more people aware, especially as in Ireland.
*15:42.020- 15:46.680* :  It's kind of assumed that we don't really have any sort of seismic activity.
*15:46.680- 15:50.560* :  We don't have any earthquakes or anything like that, whereas that's not the case.
*15:50.560- 15:53.340* :  We do actually have earthquakes. They're just very, very small.
*15:53.340- 15:58.780* :  I never thought that I would be able to incorporate Taylor Swift into my PhD.
*15:59.260- 16:01.520* :  Enthusiastic crowds have done this before.
*16:01.520- 16:07.540* :  In 2011, American football fans caused what's become known as the Beast Quake during a match
*16:07.640- 16:10.120* :  between the Seattle Seavorks and the New Orleans Saints.
*16:14.200- 16:18.820* :  Eleanor told me her predictions, which era she thinks will get the fans in Dublin going.
*16:19.220- 16:27.420* :  I definitely think the reputation era is an era which has the most songs that you can scream and shout to.
*16:32.180- 16:36.980* :  But then also maybe it would be interesting to see if the tortured perks department also does.
*16:37.300- 16:40.080* :  Because a lot of activity because obviously it's the newest era.
*16:55.320- 17:00.500* :  The music of Taylor Swift and that was Eleanor Dunn ending that report by Holly Gibbs.
*17:00.920- 17:05.780* :  And we'll hopefully hear what Eleanor discovers in a few weeks time here on the Happy Pot.
*17:11.480- 17:12.700* :  Coming up in this podcast,
*17:16.820- 17:21.520* :  it's not only surbibing, it's really, I think, more alive than ever.
*17:25.100- 17:29.080* :  The festival celebrating the traditional and the modern flamenco.
*17:38.000- 17:42.680* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*17:42.920- 17:45.340* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.

*17:49.300- 17:53.060* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*17:53.320- 17:58.340* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*18:42.920- 18:46.320* :  A sculpture exhibition with a difference is about to open in the Caribbean,
*18:46.320- 18:51.640* :  and I mean literally. The artwork, 30 small origami-style boats,
*18:51.640- 18:56.260* :  each carrying a model of a local schoolchild is being installed underwater,
*18:56.260- 19:02.340* :  just off the island of Karyoko in the Grenadines. The sculpture is designed to symbolise the
*19:02.340- 19:08.400* :  fragility of the ecosystem in the face of climate change, will act as individual artificial reefs.
*19:08.420- 19:13.560* :  They're the work of Jason DeCare Taylor, who's created more than a dozen underwater galleries
*19:13.560- 19:19.620* :  and museums, and will be installed close to his first underwater exhibit. He's spoke to the BBC's
*19:19.620- 19:24.500* :  Anushka Matanda Doherty about his inspiration and that first sculpture park.
*19:26.640- 19:31.160* :  So I installed all the sculptures in an area called Mollena Bay, which was off the
*19:31.520- 19:37.540* :  the west coast of Grenada. It had these beautiful areas of white sand surrounded by sort of
*19:38.060- 19:43.840* :  you know, little coral enclaves. He was a trained sculptor, turned scuba diving instructor,
*19:43.840- 19:49.760* :  who had always fancyed the idea of placing his art underwater, but hadn't quite got around to it.
*19:50.380- 19:54.900* :  But that all changed in September 2004, when Hurricane Ivan hit.
*19:55.800- 19:59.980* :  For eight hours, the islands were pounded with 120 miles per hour winds.
*20:01.240- 20:05.780* :  When a hurricane hits an underwater area, it basically lifts everything off the sea floor,
*20:05.780- 20:14.720* :  so rocks, boulders, and then it kind of scours the surface, any fragile corals, sea fans, sponges,
*20:15.520- 20:18.000* :  all get completely scraped off and ground down.
*20:18.760- 20:23.600* :  Jason worried that as Grenada started to rebuild, the few remaining reefs would be vulnerable
*20:23.600- 20:29.560* :  to an influx of scuba divers. I mean, the main reasons I decided to put sculptures underwater
*20:29.560- 20:36.480* :  first. I wanted to divert tourists away from fragile pristine areas. I also wanted to create a habitat,
*20:36.480- 20:42.100* :  an artificial reef, marine creatures to live in, for corals and sponges, etc to grow on.
*20:43.080- 20:45.900* :  And it didn't take long to see. It was a success.
*20:47.760- 20:51.960* :  So the sculptures changed very quickly after a couple days. I started to see, you know,
*20:51.960- 20:57.980* :  thinned film of green turf algae that would grow on the faces. That was quickly followed by
*20:57.980- 21:03.780* :  these beautiful purple sponges and blue sponges. Then there was little juvenile corals.
*21:03.820- 21:11.280* :  It started to get patches of fire coral, which is this beautiful bright orange sort of furry coral
*21:11.280- 21:16.600* :  that sends off little fingers in different directions. And then also the fish started to move in,
*21:16.600- 21:21.880* :  parrotfish started to eat some of the algae on the surface. There were little fireworms that
*21:21.880- 21:26.920* :  would actually eat the fire coral and crawl across the faces and scroll little lines as they
*21:26.920- 21:33.080* :  walked across. One of my favorite moments was seeing a sculpture that was actually on the seabed.
*21:33.680- 21:38.080* :  And when I went down to look at it, I saw a pair of eyes, you know, staring out from this gap.
*21:38.860- 21:44.100* :  When I looked under, it was this amazing octopus that sort of made a home and it made a little
*21:44.100- 21:49.240* :  entrance with shells around. And as it came out, it sort of curled the tentacle around one of the
*21:49.240- 21:55.960* :  faces of the of the pieces. And yeah, it was incredible. He hasn't stopped submerging his sculptures
*21:55.960- 22:03.680* :  ever since. We worked in a sort of city fjord that was quite polluted and very sort of brown water.
*22:04.460- 22:09.100* :  But actually when you put your head beneath the water, from underwater looking to the sky,
*22:09.860- 22:16.140* :  you know, the light turned it all this beautiful golden brown green colour. So like golden clouds
*22:16.140- 22:22.700* :  hovering over your head, tiny shrimps, cut in a little banded shrimps, started appearing white,
*22:22.700- 22:28.560* :  calcareous worms. And that was just sort of on a kind of macro scale. And then we sort of
*22:28.580- 22:33.400* :  panned out. There was thousands of muscles that lived on them, started to see seagulls going
*22:33.400- 22:39.040* :  underwater that were eating the muscles that were growing. And then the sort of the highlight for
*22:39.040- 22:44.740* :  me was at the end, as I went to leave, we saw some seals. And they were the sort of the apex
*22:44.740- 22:51.960* :  predators of the whole chain of life. And for me, that was sort of, you know, really humbling and
*22:51.960- 22:57.880* :  inspiring thing that, you know, take a very big intervention to sort of begin this whole web
*22:57.880- 23:05.640* :  of life. And you could see how quickly nature rejuvenates, it changes, it evolves, and how resilient
*23:05.640- 23:13.400* :  it is. The sculptor Jason Dickher Taylor. Now we just love animal stories here on the happy
*23:13.400- 23:19.280* :  pod. So here are a few we've spotted. An Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a
*23:19.280- 23:25.540* :  rare set of twins in what's been described as a miracle. Workers at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace
*23:25.580- 23:31.960* :  hadn't realised that the mother, a 36 year old named Chamchuri, was carrying two calves, a boy
*23:31.960- 23:37.420* :  and a girl. The twins have been featuring in live streams on social media. A critically
*23:37.420- 23:43.900* :  endangered Bornean orangutan has been born in Northern England. Staff at Blackpool Zoo said
*23:43.900- 23:49.060* :  they're delighted by the second birth in 12 months, after more than 20 years of waiting.
*23:49.060- 23:54.800* :  Both mother and baby, who's yet to be named, are doing well. And a flamingo, who was described
*23:54.800- 24:01.600* :  as having been unlucky in love, has laid her first egg at, wait for it, the age of 70.
*24:02.140- 24:08.060* :  Gertrude is part of a flamboyance of more than 65 flamingos at a nature reserve in eastern England.
*24:08.100- 24:13.740* :  Staff say the egg may not hatch, but it's amazing that she's displayed maternal
*24:13.740- 24:21.420* :  characteristics at such a ripe old age. Good for Gertrude. For the latest in our series of your
*24:21.420- 24:27.160* :  chance overseas encounters, lots of you have been in touch, including Jack, who now lives in Malaysia.
*24:27.760- 24:32.780* :  I'm originally from Indola, Zambia, a small mining community on the Zambia Congo border.
*24:33.500- 24:38.820* :  I moved to Odisha, now Zambibwe, when I was seven, and left to live in Toronto when I was 14.
*24:39.560- 24:45.760* :  I lived in Toronto for about 35 years. I met one person, who also went to the same primary school
*24:45.760- 24:53.060* :  as I did in Zambibwe, but never met anybody from Zambia or Indola. When I moved to Penang in 2016,
*24:53.220- 24:57.520* :  I was looking at apartments to rent and was chatting with the gentleman about that unit.
*24:58.260- 25:03.360* :  Turned out, he had lived in both Zambia and Zambibwe. I was amazed. A few days later,
*25:03.360- 25:08.460* :  I was introduced to a couple that had just moved from Hong Kong to Penang. In chatting with the
*25:08.460- 25:13.740* :  husband, John, it turned out that he was from just outside of Indola, where his family had a farm
*25:13.740- 25:19.480* :  with a pond on it. When I was a child, I used to go fishing with my father and brother on a farm pond.
*25:19.480- 25:25.340* :  I suspect very strongly it was the same pond, and our parents knew each other. John and I are now
*25:25.340- 25:31.560* :  firm friends. Thanks Jack, and if you'd like to tell us about an unexpected meeting, send us an email
*25:31.560- 25:37.460* :  or a voice note. Some of the world's top flamenco performers have been bringing their
*25:37.460- 25:44.240* :  soulful voices and dramatic dance moves to Sadler's Wales Theatre here in London. The goal of the
*25:44.240- 25:50.360* :  19th edition of the flamenco festival to prove that the ancient art form which dates back hundreds
*25:50.360- 25:56.620* :  of years is thriving and adapting to the modern day, and Isabella Jewel went to check it out.
*26:06.300- 26:12.980* :  It's not only survival, it's really, I think, more alive than ever, because it's not only associated
*26:12.980- 26:19.900* :  to a full-chloric, popular expression of dance of some people in the south of Spain. No,
*26:20.620- 26:26.280* :  it's an expression that can connect with anybody. It's a universal expression.
*26:27.080- 26:33.820* :  That's Miguel Morin, director of the flamenco festival at Sadler's Wales. Since 2003 he's been
*26:33.820- 26:39.220* :  bringing global talents in the world of flamenco to London, and for Miguel it's all about lifting
*26:39.220- 26:45.500* :  the lid on a dance style that's often seen as a bit old school. For me it's like I want people to
*26:45.500- 26:52.100* :  see the meaning of the world flamenco. Usually it's associated to a traditional art form, but today
*26:52.100- 26:57.100* :  it's not so. It's associated to that but also to have an art to contemporary, to choreography,
*26:57.100- 27:02.840* :  to large scale production. One of the performances flipping tradition on its head is a
*27:02.840- 27:08.780* :  Fandango, and there wasn't a red ruffle dress or polkadot in sight. The show featured a
*27:08.780- 27:14.780* :  collective of dancers, a singer and a band, and the music sometimes floated into the realm of jazz
*27:14.780- 27:20.540* :  and electronic. David Correa is the choreographer and one of the main dancers in the show.
*27:24.340- 27:30.720* :  In Fandango we look at customs of Spain and our people we play on flamenco and a variety of
*27:30.720- 27:37.720* :  folklore traditions. What I do specifically is a try and mix styles of dance from very traditional
*27:37.720- 27:43.020* :  and all Spanish dancers to the contemporary. Correa worked with esteemed from Enco's singer
*27:43.020- 27:47.900* :  Davi Laos to put together this performance, which takes the audience on a journey through
*27:47.900- 27:54.640* :  Spanish history, examining themes like the Civil War and bullfighting, but doing it in a modern way.
*27:55.660- 28:04.240* :  But that's not new in flamenco. It is a living art form. There is so many different influences
*28:04.800- 28:10.940* :  that integrate themselves into flamenco, so many different aspects of other cultures and music
*28:10.940- 28:18.120* :  styles. For example, the box, the cajon, is a proven instrument that was introduced in the 70s to
*28:18.120- 28:25.520* :  Andalofia. It is from our culture, but it's now a key part of flamenco. And despite its usual
*28:25.520- 28:32.520* :  associations with southern Spain, the art form has an international appeal. Florencia Oz also
*28:32.520- 28:42.220* :  performs in Fandango. I'm from Chile, but I've lived in Spain for 18 years. I actually learned flamenco
*28:42.220- 28:47.460* :  in Chile outside of a school. It's a really popular, extra-gricular activity there.
*28:50.340- 28:57.040* :  Flamenco, for many years, has gone beyond its traditional associations. So it's really been
*28:57.040- 29:03.080* :  expanded in terms of music and dance styles. So with electronic music, it's one of the ways in
*29:03.080- 29:09.760* :  this case is being used to break the stereotypes of the Fandango. It's not just the music that's
*29:09.760- 29:15.740* :  constantly changing and modernizing. Eva Yerba Buena, who's widely considered one of flamenco's
*29:15.740- 29:21.420* :  leading performers, showcased how the costumes on stage have adapted since the birth of the art form.
*29:22.000- 29:27.600* :  At one point, she wore a shiny black PVC skirt alongside a traditional colorful shawl.
*29:28.160- 29:33.020* :  First of all, director Miguel Marín. How the generation is going to relate to flamenco?
*29:33.300- 29:38.400* :  Is there a static? Is something that only the grandparents would relate to? It's not possible.
*29:38.740- 29:44.020* :  It has to be something that is part of your time. But what is it about flamenco that continues
*29:44.020- 29:49.660* :  to connect so deeply with people? It's a mix of many different cultures. There is the gypsies
*29:49.660- 29:54.180* :  that came from India, the Jewish community that was established in Spain, the Muslim community,
*29:54.180- 29:59.700* :  that was established in Spain, and of course the Iberian community. That brings many angles
*29:59.740- 30:06.880* :  together, which I think make that people can relate to flamenco, but also because it really
*30:06.880- 30:13.720* :  trigger the basic human emotions, and anybody can connect with that.
*30:23.900- 30:29.500* :  The music pre-iron del miedo by David Legos, ending that report by Isabella Jewel.
*30:35.060- 30:38.680* :  And that's it from the happy pod for now. We'd love to hear from you if you have any
