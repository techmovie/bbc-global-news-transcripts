*01:28.320- 01:30.920* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:33.560- 01:37.680* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Tuesday the 18th of June these are our main stories.
*01:37.680- 01:42.940* :  The governor of the US state of Maryland has pardoned tens of thousands of people convicted
*01:42.940- 01:48.820* :  of cannabis offenses. A search operation is underway for 30 people after deadly landslides
*01:48.820- 01:54.920* :  hit a town in central Ecuador. Ukraine have lost to Romania in their openly match of the euros.
*01:57.660- 02:02.760* :  Also in this podcast. The penalty for excessive speeding in Switzerland can be severe with offenders
*02:02.760- 02:09.120* :  facing up to four years in prison or find thousands of pounds. The eye-watering finds awaiting
*02:09.120- 02:18.260* :  four speeding brits abroad. The governor of the US state of Maryland has pardoned tens
*02:18.260- 02:21.800* :  of thousands of people convicted of cannabis offenses.
*02:22.420- 02:29.600* :  Wes Moore told a news conference that his executive order involved over 175,000 convictions.
*02:29.600- 02:34.660* :  He said black people in Maryland had been three times more likely than their white counterparts
*02:34.660- 02:37.280* :  to be arrested for cannabis-related offenses.
*02:37.960- 02:45.540* :  This is a responsibility that I take very, very seriously. And that is why with deep ride
*02:46.400- 02:53.360* :  and soberness, I will pardon over 175,000 convictions.
*02:57.680- 03:02.740* :  I spoke to the BBC's correspondent in Washington, Nomea Ikbal, who told us how significant
*03:02.740- 03:08.140* :  this pardoning is. The governor, Wes Moore's pardons, they include more than 150,000
*03:08.140- 03:12.500* :  misdemeanor convictions for the possession of cannabis, and they also involve more than
*03:12.580- 03:19.920* :  18,000 misdemeanor convictions for use of drug paraphernalia or possession with intent to use
*03:19.920- 03:24.360* :  such items. So it's pretty sweeping and historic in terms of what he's done.
*03:24.980- 03:27.380* :  And what did Wes Moore say about the reasons for doing it?
*03:27.620- 03:34.160* :  He said it's a step to heal decades of social and economic injustice that disproportionately
*03:34.160- 03:41.540* :  harms black and brown people. And Mr Moore said that these criminal records have basically been
*03:41.540- 03:48.420* :  used to deny housing, employment, education, and they've essentially been holding people
*03:48.420- 03:54.580* :  and their families back long after the sentences were served. So his point is that these policies
*03:54.580- 04:00.600* :  have been intentionally deployed to hold back entire communities. And he said that to quote him,
*04:00.600- 04:06.420* :  he was ecstatic to write these wrongs. It's worth emphasising that the pardons will not
*04:06.420- 04:08.620* :  result in anyone being released from jail.
*04:08.960- 04:14.400* :  To what extent is marijuana and its legalisation at political issue at a federal level?
*04:14.620- 04:20.160* :  It's really interesting because in this year's state, the union address, President Biden did say
*04:20.300- 04:25.200* :  no one should be jailed for using or possessing marijuana and his administration
*04:26.000- 04:32.580* :  has said they want to move forward with a plan to ease federal restrictions and basically reclassify
*04:32.580- 04:40.140* :  the drug and unlock new voters, young voters. Donald Trump's an interesting one because he hasn't
*04:40.140- 04:45.820* :  shown many signs really of wanting to engage with federal marijuana policy. He did want say he
*04:45.820- 04:52.400* :  supports medical marijuana, he wants states to set their own laws. And there was a poll last year
*04:52.400- 04:57.520* :  by Gallup, which found that 70% of the country have support recreational legislation,
*04:57.580- 05:05.840* :  whereas Republican voters are the one demographic group who are so sharply split on full legalisation.
*05:05.900- 05:11.500* :  It's pretty much down the middle. So that might be why we haven't heard much from Donald Trump.
*05:11.500- 05:18.440* :  But as I mentioned, President Biden has talked about making this an issue as we go forward in
*05:18.440- 05:22.120* :  the election to try and tap in presumably into those younger voters.
*05:22.880- 05:28.680* :  Nomi Ekbal. Next to Ecuador and rescue workers and volunteers in the country have been looking
*05:28.680- 05:34.400* :  for survivors of Sunday's landslide, which have killed at least six people. The rescue efforts
*05:34.400- 05:40.320* :  are concentrated in the central town of Banias de Aguasanta, our America's regional editor,
*05:40.320- 05:45.560* :  Leonardo Rosser explains. 30 people have been reported missing in the area affected by the
*05:45.560- 05:51.740* :  biggest landslide. Dozens of families have been evacuated to improvised shelters. The landslides
*05:51.740- 05:57.440* :  were triggered by heavy rains across central parts of Ecuador over the weekends. The storms have
*05:57.440- 06:03.280* :  led to the temporary closure of a major private pipeline linking oil producing areas in Ecuador's
*06:03.280- 06:09.440* :  Amazon region to the coastline. Power cuts have been reported and school classes have been suspended.
*06:09.980- 06:14.960* :  The authorities have sent heavy machinery to the region to clear roads that have been blocked by
*06:15.020- 06:22.380* :  mards. Leonardo Rosser. The White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby has said that the
*06:22.380- 06:27.820* :  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was left with little choice over his decision to
*06:27.820- 06:34.700* :  expand Israel's war cabinets. This is after the centrist former general Benny Gantz left the
*06:34.700- 06:40.480* :  Israeli government. It's thought Mr Netanyahu will now discuss the conflict in Gaza in ad-hoc
*06:40.480- 06:46.500* :  meetings. With his defence minister you have galant and other relevant officials. With the details
*06:46.500- 06:52.840* :  he's our Middle East correspondent John Donerson. The war cabinet was set up days after the October 7th
*06:52.840- 06:59.400* :  Hamas attack to signal political unity, but that unity is long gone. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:59.400- 07:04.960* :  is being squeezed from the far right and from the centre. When the opposition figure Benny Gantz
*07:04.960- 07:10.400* :  quit the war cabinet eight days ago saying Mr Netanyahu had no strategic plan for a post-war
*07:10.620- 07:16.720* :  Gaza. It lost a relatively moderate voice, someone with vast military experience and a man who
*07:16.720- 07:21.720* :  had the air of the Americans. From the far right the hard-line national security minister,
*07:21.720- 07:28.020* :  Itamar Ben-Gavir, who opposes any kind of ceasefire with Hamas, demanded he replace Mr Gantz
*07:28.020- 07:33.560* :  on the war cabinet. Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected that idea, choosing instead to dissolve
*07:33.560- 07:38.540* :  the body altogether. It leaves him with greater personal control over decision making,
*07:38.540- 07:44.800* :  but he cuts an increasingly isolated figure. There's discord too with the military. The IDF
*07:44.800- 07:49.880* :  has continued with a daily tactical military pause on the road leading into Gaza from the
*07:49.880- 07:56.960* :  Keram Shalom crossing to allow more humanitarian aid in, even though Mr Netanyahu had publicly called
*07:56.960- 08:03.460* :  the decision unacceptable. Aid agencies in Gaza have welcomed the pause, but say it is yet to make
*08:03.740- 08:09.100* :  any difference on the ground. John Donerson in Jerusalem. Well, Simccia Rothman is a member of the
*08:09.100- 08:14.420* :  Knesset for the far right national religious party, which is in Prime Minister Netanyahu's ruling
*08:14.420- 08:19.160* :  coalition. Now, while our Mugafi asked him what he made of Netanyahu's decision.
*08:19.820- 08:25.320* :  The ruling is realized that there is no such thing as a war cabinet. There is a cabinet
*08:25.540- 08:32.420* :  that have all the decision making power in issues of war and issues of foreign affairs.
*08:33.120- 08:40.680* :  And this is the security cabinet. And because there were parts of coalition, the namely Gans
*08:40.680- 08:47.200* :  Party, that came into the coalition and they said, we don't want to be involved in the government.
*08:47.200- 08:53.800* :  We just came to help with the war, that was their claim. So there was a new creation called war
*08:53.800- 08:59.320* :  cabinet for them. They left the coalition. There is no need for this war cabinet. And all the
*08:59.320- 09:05.040* :  decision making power is back into the regular security cabinet in which my head of party,
*09:05.040- 09:09.800* :  but Salah Smotrić is a member. I mean, from what I understand, there is a 14 member security
*09:09.800- 09:15.220* :  cabinet, which your party leader is a part of. But also, there will be something called the
*09:15.260- 09:20.160* :  smaller consultation forum, at least that's what we've read and Harret is reporting on today.
*09:20.160- 09:25.640* :  And he will not be a part of this forum. And one presumes that this is where the serious
*09:25.640- 09:30.620* :  conversations and decisions are going to be made. It's always been, especially when you have a
*09:30.620- 09:36.660* :  group of 14 people, but you have different phone consultation groups. It's not illegal to consult,
*09:36.660- 09:43.220* :  not for the prime minister and not for the foreign affairs ministers to consult with in every
*09:43.220- 09:50.260* :  group he sees feet. Even during the time that there were war cabinets, of course, me and my party
*09:50.660- 09:58.440* :  leader, but Salah Smotrić, we were in close contact with prime minister and with the minister
*09:58.440- 10:04.920* :  of defense. And there were issues that we consulted with them or argued with them. Some people try
*10:04.920- 10:11.340* :  to make a lot of fuss about about nothing. So you're saying, you know, not much has changed. Have
*10:11.340- 10:18.160* :  you been happy with how the war has played out? And do you feel like your party was always being
*10:18.160- 10:23.260* :  hurt by the war cabinet? No, I did not say it was heard by the war cabinet. I said it was heard by
*10:23.460- 10:29.160* :  prime minister and minister of defense on some issues. On some issues, no. And when it was
*10:29.880- 10:36.860* :  important enough for the public to know our disagreements, we made it public. And most of the times
*10:37.640- 10:43.620* :  it stayed within the security cabinet or within the consultation group. And what was the most
*10:43.620- 10:51.480* :  important issue for us at the party that the war to eliminate Hamas and to get back the hostages
*10:52.180- 10:58.640* :  will continue. There were offers on the table. Sadly, some of them were coming with the pressure
*10:59.360- 11:07.020* :  from outside to say basically finished the war without eliminating Hamas. And for that, we were
*11:07.020- 11:14.380* :  very strong against. But we see that the war on Hamas continues. And we will make sure that it will
*11:14.380- 11:20.460* :  continue until Hamas is eliminated. Simcha Rothman, member of a Knesset for the Far Right National
*11:20.460- 11:26.920* :  Religious Party, a senior American envoy who's tasked with resolving the growing conflict between
*11:26.920- 11:32.300* :  Israel and their Hezbollah group in Lebanon has been meeting Israeli leaders as concerns
*11:32.300- 11:39.420* :  grow about an escalation in cross-border attacks. Amos Hochstein is due to travel to the Lebanese
*11:39.420- 11:45.000* :  capital Beirut on Tuesday. His sudden visit to the region follows a sharp rise in hostilities after
*11:45.000- 11:50.580* :  Israel's assassination at the top Hezbollah commander last week. Our Middle East correspondent Lucy
*11:50.580- 11:58.240* :  Williamson has been to that border and sent this report. Everything is just broken on the
*11:58.240- 12:03.960* :  glasses. Everything. Just inside the shattered door of Tom Perry's house is part of the Hezbollah
*12:03.960- 12:09.220* :  rocket that slammed into it earlier this month. The blast punched large, shrapnel holes across
*12:09.220- 12:15.060* :  the ceiling and walls and blew apart doors and furniture. Tom was out having a beer with friends.
*12:15.100- 12:21.540* :  His girlfriend was visiting her mother. This house is not a direct house to Lebanon. You can see
*12:21.540- 12:27.140* :  there is trees and bushes and houses all around and we thought there is no rocket that can
*12:28.280- 12:34.640* :  hit this house but it happened. So now people understand they are not safe here. It doesn't
*12:34.640- 12:40.760* :  matter where they live or if they are in their shelter or something. It's not safe here. Just
*12:40.760- 12:46.560* :  not safe. Tom Perry's house perched on Israel's border with Lebanon. It's a three hour drive
*12:46.560- 12:52.020* :  from where his prime minister met America's special envoy today to try to stop this conflict
*12:52.020- 12:59.220* :  escalating further. Israel says more than 5,000 explosive missiles have been fired by Hezbollah
*12:59.220- 13:06.040* :  across its border since the Hamas attacks last October. The US and others say a ceasefire in Gaza
*13:06.560- 13:12.240* :  is the best way to also end the growing conflict in the North. But Israel's military and political
*13:12.240- 13:18.500* :  leaders have been talking up the threat of war. That may be part of Israel's practice strategy
*13:18.500- 13:25.360* :  of deterrence but every Hezbollah rocket or Israeli strike carries the risk of a miscalculation
*13:25.360- 13:32.300* :  that triggers a full blown war. Lucy Williamson Norway is to increase funding for the UN
*13:32.300- 13:39.460* :  Agency Unwa by $9 million. The organisation was plunged into a financial crisis back in January
*13:40.120- 13:45.720* :  when many donor countries suspended support in response to Israeli allegations that 12
*13:45.720- 13:51.780* :  of its staff took part in the deadly Hamas attack of October the 7th. Most governments have
*13:51.780- 13:58.340* :  resumed funding after an independent investigation but the United States has not. The Norwegian
*13:58.340- 14:06.240* :  Foreign Minister Espen Barth Aide said more aid was still needed. I'm glad to say that we now see
*14:06.240- 14:11.240* :  that almost all the donors who suspended their support are now back so the financial situation
*14:11.240- 14:16.900* :  is better than it could have been if this had continued but of course they are not good which is
*14:16.900- 14:23.600* :  why we are now topping up our support. Espen Barth Aidee earlier he warned that the Palestinian
*14:23.600- 14:28.480* :  authority could collapse in the coming months due to a lack of international backing
*14:28.480- 14:35.420* :  and the withholding of tax revenues by Israel. Monday marked the official start of campaigning for
*14:35.420- 14:39.760* :  the SNAP General Election in France. It was called by President Emmanuel Macron
*14:40.240- 14:45.480* :  after his Renaissance party lost heavily to the anti-immigration national rally in the
*14:45.480- 14:51.000* :  recent EU parliamentary polls. Voting will take place over two Sundays with the first round
*14:51.000- 14:57.500* :  on the 30th of June. Mr Macron is seeking to portray rival alliances on both the right and the
*14:57.500- 15:02.900* :  left as being dominated by extremists. Our correspondent Hugh Scofield has more from Paris.
*15:03.380- 15:08.660* :  Obviously the question on everyone's minds is it possible for France to have a far-right
*15:08.660- 15:15.160* :  government three weeks from now a national rally did so well in the European elections if repeated
*15:15.340- 15:21.880* :  at the legislative elections could that lead to a national rally far-right Prime Minister in the
*15:21.880- 15:28.080* :  form of Jordan Badella. It's possible but it's far from a given that the fact being that the European
*15:28.080- 15:33.220* :  elections are very different in their structure from the legislative elections and even if the
*15:33.220- 15:39.000* :  national rally did get a very high score again says 32 33 34 percent of the overall population now
*15:39.000- 15:44.680* :  would not necessarily translate into a majority in Parliament. So we'll have to see the arithmetic
*15:44.680- 15:50.220* :  of it all is very very complicated you know there are 577 constituencies there's the centrist
*15:50.220- 15:57.040* :  block the left wing now united presenting only one candidate in each in each constituency so they
*15:57.040- 16:01.780* :  are counting on you know much better than they might have hoped and we'll just have to see that
*16:01.780- 16:05.980* :  after the first round we should have give a clearer picture because then we'll be able to see
*16:05.980- 16:11.300* :  which of the two in most constituencies the two front runners who qualify for the runoff and
*16:11.300- 16:15.420* :  there will be able to make closer predictions about what's going to happen. Hugh Scofield.
*16:18.200- 16:24.540* :  Still to come. People are frustrated that despite having these incredible record-breaking
*16:24.540- 16:31.360* :  tourism numbers a third of the population is still at a risk of poverty and social exclusion.
*16:31.680- 16:38.000* :  With the end of the COVID pandemic foreign travel is on the increase leading to so-called over-tourism.

*18:13.360- 18:18.340* :  European championship is not a question about the result on the pitch but the question
*18:18.340- 18:25.060* :  result of how Ukraine can talk with the Europe again and show what's happening with our country

*18:32.400- 18:37.440* :  John Bennett hugely disappointing for the Ukraine fans after all that the build up to their team
*18:37.440- 18:42.560* :  playing at this tournament against all the odds Romania are a good side we have to remember that
*18:42.560- 18:46.860* :  they were unbeaten and qualifying that they're in good form so of course Ukraine knew it was going
*18:46.860- 18:50.740* :  to be tough but I think it's not the defeat that has let the fans down it was the manner of the
*18:50.740- 18:56.260* :  performance really underwhelming lack of intensity lack of urgency not what you've come to expect
*18:56.260- 19:01.120* :  from this team and the manager Sergei Rebrov has said the performance was really unexpected he was
*19:01.120- 19:07.000* :  surprised by the poor performance John I gather they've been trying to highlight the war in Ukraine
*19:07.000- 19:10.400* :  the team throughout this tournament how they've been doing that yeah there was a section of
*19:10.600- 19:16.740* :  seating from a stadium in war torn karkiv that was installed in the stadium in Munich hours before
*19:16.740- 19:21.960* :  Ukraine took to the field for this opening match under a chefchenko legendary player the
*19:21.980- 19:26.160* :  country's all-time top scorer he's now the president of the Ukraine Football Association he was
*19:26.160- 19:30.980* :  there to unveil this exhibition but I think the most striking moment of the tournament so far
*19:30.980- 19:36.040* :  involving Ukraine was a social media video released by the Football Association a few days ago all
*19:36.040- 19:39.940* :  the players talking about how each of their hometowns are being affected by the war
*19:40.640- 19:46.920* :  John Bennett president Putin will make a two-day visit to North Korea from Tuesday
*19:47.420- 19:52.080* :  cementing improved relations between Moscow and Pyongyang North Korea has been accused of
*19:52.080- 19:57.740* :  supplying arms and ammunition to Russia in support of its war in Ukraine Moscow is thought to be
*19:57.740- 20:03.140* :  giving North Korea food and help with its weapons programs last year the North Korean leader
*20:03.140- 20:10.420* :  Kim Jong-un visited Russia James Kim Rosami spoke to Sue Kim from a CIA analyst on North Korea
*20:10.420- 20:15.940* :  who's based in Washington and asked how significant is this visit by the Russian president this is
*20:15.940- 20:21.480* :  the first time in 24 years that the Russian leader is paying a visit to North Korea and we know
*20:21.480- 20:26.900* :  that the two countries have been you know mutually it's a mutually beneficial relationship what is
*20:26.900- 20:32.520* :  important now I think is of course the atmosphere of geopolitics with the war going on and alarming
*20:32.520- 20:39.740* :  so because North Korea is also bent on developing and advancing its its weapons program the atmosphere
*20:39.740- 20:46.020* :  is such that both countries and both leaders are viewing each other of course as friends on the outside
*20:46.020- 20:52.860* :  but also as complicit partners in and furthering and strengthening their cooperation so at the end
*20:52.860- 20:58.280* :  of this visit of course the atmosphere figure to remain pretty much the same on the outside but
*20:58.920- 21:04.360* :  what we are concerned about is of course the fact that these two countries are able to communicate
*21:04.360- 21:11.560* :  and also collaborate on areas where we are concerned about proliferation we're concerned about
*21:11.560- 21:17.940* :  destabilization in the region not just in Eastern Europe but also in East Asia where it's a tender
*21:17.940- 21:25.680* :  box of potential provocations and instability so all in all it's going to be a you know an alarm
*21:25.680- 21:29.740* :  for the United States and other countries in the region that are concerned well what about
*21:29.740- 21:35.920* :  the big player in the region China how does it view this warming of ties between Russia and North
*21:35.920- 21:43.780* :  Korea you would want to be think that the alignment of Russia's Putin and and North Korea's
*21:43.780- 21:49.800* :  Kim would be concerning to Xi Jinping because typically when we look at the relationship in North
*21:50.060- 21:55.580* :  Korea and China we typically think of China to be North Korea's number one go-to partner
*21:55.580- 22:02.320* :  I still think that that's true and North Korea still looks to China as its economic sponsor
*22:02.900- 22:07.960* :  I don't think that is going to change I also think that you know those three countries
*22:07.960- 22:15.580* :  Russia North Korea China they're all in this symbiotic relationship and the relationship is such
*22:15.580- 22:22.040* :  that let's say that we do envision we see greater and further cooperation between North Korea and
*22:22.040- 22:27.500* :  Russia is that going to come at the deficit of North Korea's relationship with China where
*22:27.500- 22:33.760* :  North Korea depends on Beijing economically unclear if North Korea is willing to take it that far
*22:33.940- 22:39.120* :  and also I think the three leaders would be cognizant of the dynamics in the region as well
*22:39.780- 22:46.900* :  Su Kim former CIA analyst on North Korea China has launched an investigation into
*22:47.100- 22:53.660* :  pork products from the European Union in what appears to be a tit-for-tat action last week the EU
*22:53.660- 23:00.460* :  decided to impose tariffs of up to 40% on Chinese electric vehicles the investigation is the EU
*23:00.460- 23:06.040* :  pork could result in Beijing imposing its own tariffs a spokesman for the European Commission
*23:06.040- 23:12.060* :  Olaf Gill said they would be closely monitoring the situation the commission takes note of the
*23:12.060- 23:17.480* :  decision by the government of China to initiate an anti-domping investigation on European imports of
*23:17.480- 23:23.280* :  pork and swine by products the commission is now analyzing the application we will follow the
*23:23.280- 23:28.200* :  proceedings very closely in coordination with the EU industry and our member states and we will
*23:28.200- 23:33.900* :  intervene as appropriate to ensure that the investigation fully complies with all relevant world
*23:33.900- 23:41.360* :  trade organization rules Ava Goksik covers the pork and beef sectors in Europe for a rabobank
*23:42.020- 23:47.300* :  Roger Hering asked her first about the size of the EU's pork trade with China China is actually
*23:47.300- 23:55.200* :  the single biggest market for EU pork representing over about 30% of total EU pork export so yeah we
*23:55.200- 24:00.860* :  are quite reliant on China yeah I understand about three billion dollars worth pretty much which
*24:00.860- 24:07.120* :  is which is pretty huge yes yeah it's huge although our dependency decreased over the past two
*24:07.120- 24:16.300* :  three years so it's big in 2020 when our dependency was around 55 60% because China was demanding more
*24:16.300- 24:22.320* :  pork as they were just recovering from the African swine fever outbreaks but now yeah it's still
*24:22.320- 24:28.680* :  a significant market and if the worse some tariffs put on EU pork how would that affect the trade
*24:28.860- 24:35.680* :  higher tariffs would or could actually deteriorate further the competitive position of the EU
*24:36.240- 24:42.300* :  we already see quite high prices in the EU for pork relative to other exporters such as
*24:42.300- 24:47.960* :  US and Brazil that is because our supply declined over the past two years so if competitive
*24:47.960- 24:54.060* :  position is affected then also price levels margins in the European pork supply chains can be affected
*24:54.740- 24:59.960* :  so Europe might lose market share in other words yes that's right and that would be very damaging I
*24:59.960- 25:04.720* :  guessed it to many European economies which economies within Europe would be most vulnerable well if
*25:04.720- 25:10.820* :  we are looking at the biggest exporters of pork in Europe that would be Spain and also they are
*25:11.240- 25:18.380* :  supplying most of the products China and also the Netherlands Denmark France those are also big
*25:18.380- 25:24.560* :  exporters with large exposure to China now of course talking of tariffs reminds us that in fact
*25:24.560- 25:31.000* :  Europe has decided to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles is this being seen as a
*25:31.540- 25:37.660* :  tit for tat do you think yeah well I think so I do think that that's the kind of the reason for
*25:38.160- 25:43.140* :  this investigation because what the Chinese says that they have complaints on their own domestic
*25:43.880- 25:48.360* :  producers of pork that this is unfair competition but you don't think that that necessarily
*25:48.360- 25:54.980* :  is true I don't think so because China is reliant on on imports on pork imports because they
*25:54.980- 26:01.280* :  have a self-sufficiency about 95% so they are still relying on pork imports and they are importing
*26:01.280- 26:07.660* :  from Brazil from US Europe actually is there biggest supplier but when you look at prices in Europe
*26:07.660- 26:14.640* :  those are quite high and they are still importing products from from from the EU and I don't think
*26:14.640- 26:21.100* :  that we can go below our cost price levels because yeah it just wouldn't make sense for European
*26:21.100- 26:27.380* :  exporters to sell cheaper than our production costs. Eva Goxick from Raboback
*26:28.540- 26:34.420* :  the 85 year old British actor Ian McKellen is being treated in hospital after falling off stage
*26:34.420- 26:39.480* :  during a performance in London's West End on Monday evening he's one of the world's most
*26:39.480- 26:45.500* :  distinguished Shakespearean actors and a movie star thanks to his role as Gandalf in the Lord of the
*26:45.500- 26:51.160* :  Rings our correspondent Chi Chi Isundu has more details. So Ian McKellen was taking part in a
*26:51.160- 26:56.660* :  dueling scene when he lost his footing and fell off the front of the stage a BBC journalist who
*26:56.660- 27:01.640* :  is sat in the audience said the actor could be heard crying out in pain before the house lights
*27:01.640- 27:07.240* :  came up and staff rushed towards him. The audience was then evacuated from the theatre and the
*27:07.240- 27:12.440* :  rest of the performance was cancelled. Outside theatre staff use boards and umbrellas to block
*27:12.440- 27:18.860* :  the public's view as Sir Ian was moved to awaiting ambulance his agent has confirmed he is being treated
*27:18.860- 27:25.280* :  in hospital. The extent of his injuries are not known yet Sir Ian McKellen is one of the UK's
*27:25.420- 27:31.500* :  most eminent actors with a career spanning more than six decades on stage and on screen.
*27:31.500- 27:37.120* :  He's best known for his numerous Shakespeare roles as well as playing Gandalf in the Hobbit
*27:37.120- 27:43.280* :  and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Chi Chi Isundu since the end of the Covid pandemic
*27:43.280- 27:48.680* :  tourism has again increased around the world but now from Barcelona to Bali higher fees and new
*27:48.680- 27:54.420* :  rules are targeting what's seen as the uncontrolled influx of tourism to many of the world's hot spots
*27:54.860- 28:00.400* :  tourism is of course big business for hotels restaurants and airlines but many locals in these
*28:00.400- 28:06.520* :  areas feel economically left out and that the rapid surge has gone too far. Ed Butler has been
*28:06.520- 28:10.040* :  exploring the perceived problem of what's now called over tourism.
*28:14.140- 28:20.060* :  The sound of protests in Tenerife in the Canary Islands in mid-April. Local men and women
*28:20.060- 28:29.080* :  blowing conches carrying banners. I am incredibly moved by how many people actually came out on
*28:29.080- 28:35.340* :  that day. This is Sharon Backhouse she's a British-born business woman who runs Geo Tenerife it's a
*28:35.340- 28:40.360* :  travel and research company on the island. I was there on the ground and there was people from
*28:40.360- 28:46.940* :  all walks of life and the mood was extraordinary hundreds of thousands of people on the streets
*28:46.940- 28:52.300* :  demonstrating six people on hunger strike for 20 days and one of the main things they're saying
*28:52.300- 28:56.300* :  is please put a stop to any more hotel developments until we can
*28:56.960- 29:02.160* :  implement a model that is equally good for locals and not just foreign investors.
*29:05.180- 29:09.400* :  What we hope is that the demonstration will be historic we're convinced it will be
*29:09.400- 29:14.420* :  the people are finally raising their voices they're not going to stay at home. People are
*29:14.420- 29:21.740* :  frustrated that despite having these incredible record-breaking tourism numbers a third of the
*29:21.740- 29:28.080* :  population is still at a risk of poverty and social exclusion and what locals are saying is look
*29:28.580- 29:33.880* :  we welcome tourism we have for a long time and we will continue to do so but the locals have to
*29:33.880- 29:40.580* :  be prime beneficiaries too. Tenerife is not the first place to see such protests over tourism as
*29:40.580- 29:46.740* :  it's known the influx of camera-toting visitors into small areas of natural beauty it's being
*29:46.740- 29:53.900* :  seen as a growing problem they've prompted outcry in Machu Picchu in Peru on Bali's sacred mountain
*29:54.200- 30:00.860* :  and from Egypt's pyramids to Mount Fuji in Japan they're in one town they've put up a wall to
*30:00.860- 30:05.220* :  block the view of the mountain to deter the relentless photography.
*30:09.920- 30:14.540* :  We welcome foreigners for this revitalization of the community but there are so many
*30:14.540- 30:20.160* :  violations of basic manners like jay walking dumping garbage trespassing on people's property
*30:21.200- 30:22.720* :  I wish there'd pay more attention to that.
*30:23.060- 30:28.560* :  European cities with a record-breaking visitor numbers have become the epicenter of a growing
*30:28.560- 30:35.340* :  anti-tourist sentiment now. Cocoans is a professor of new urban tourism at Inholland University in
*30:35.340- 30:41.300* :  the Netherlands. First of all there's the number of tourists so many people on the streets you can't
*30:41.660- 30:46.900* :  move freely anymore people drinking too much being rowdy and that sort of thing and then places
*30:46.900- 30:51.840* :  have become more and more suitable for tourists rather than for residents and in city centers you can
*30:51.840- 30:58.840* :  see local supermarkets, local bakeries or our local facilities not being able to afford rent
*30:58.840- 31:04.440* :  anymore because there are tourist shops now. Most tourist hotspots of course seek the economic
*31:04.440- 31:11.340* :  benefits but they are also coming up with different ideas to solve the successes. Take Venice which
*31:11.340- 31:16.840* :  last month became the first cities charged tourists coming on day trips to enter the city.
*31:17.520- 31:23.400* :  Simone Venturini is the city's deputy methodorism. Right now Venice is trying to restart
*31:23.400- 31:31.020* :  better than before. We just want less tourism in terms of quantity and we want higher tourism
*31:31.020- 31:36.800* :  in terms of quality not only to take a selfie in three hours and then go home because this is not
*31:36.800- 31:42.500* :  the right tourist for the city of Venice. The issue of taxation is an interesting one because it's
*31:42.500- 31:47.820* :  a relatively easy thing to do but again you need to be careful to only talk about the economic
*31:47.820- 31:52.960* :  benefits. The economic benefits of tourism are relatively limited to a set number of stakeholders.
*31:53.320- 31:59.140* :  People who work in tourism or who own a business but most people do not fall into that category where
*31:59.140- 32:06.600* :  is the disadvantages are felt by a much larger group of people. Professor Koukouens. The fact is
*32:06.600- 32:11.820* :  though that for all of these ideas to reduce over tourism current projections suggest that global
*32:11.820- 32:16.920* :  travel is going to carry on rising for the foreseeable future. That report by Ed Butler.
*32:17.600- 32:21.760* :  Now how much would you expect to pay out as a fine if you were caught speeding?
*32:21.820- 32:27.500* :  50 dollars maybe perhaps a couple of hundred if you're going particularly fast. When
*32:27.500- 32:33.120* :  on in Switzerland you could be seriously bankrupted there and four English tourists who
*32:33.120- 32:38.240* :  swiss police say were caught driving at more than 200 kilometers an hour are likely to have a
*32:38.240- 32:41.740* :  very nasty shock in store. Nikki Cardwell has all details.
*32:42.320- 32:47.180* :  The penalty for excessive speeding in Switzerland can be severe with offenders facing up to four
*32:47.180- 32:53.640* :  years in prison or find thousands of pounds. Cars can be confiscated and a judge may deem that
*32:53.640- 33:00.180* :  they should be sold or even scrapped. In a previous case a man caught driving his Porsche at 135
*33:00.180- 33:08.000* :  kilometers per hour through a village was fined $290,000. Zurich police say these men from England
*33:08.000- 33:14.160* :  were arrested and their cars impounded after motorists reported seeing four vehicles being driven
*33:14.160- 33:20.680* :  at extremely high speeds. All four were driving what the police described as expensive sports cars.
*33:21.460- 33:26.960* :  The speed limit on Swiss motorways is 120 kilometers per hour. Officers believed they were doing
*33:26.960- 33:33.060* :  more than 200 which pushes the offense into a more serious category. They're also investigating
*33:33.060- 33:38.840* :  whether the cars were racing. The men are believed to still be in custody. When they're released
*33:38.840- 33:43.960* :  they'll be allowed to return home while a judge decides their fate and that of their cars.
*33:47.960- 33:52.400* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
