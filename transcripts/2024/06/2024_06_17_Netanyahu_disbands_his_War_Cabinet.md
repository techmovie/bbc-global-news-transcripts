*01:19.060- 01:22.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.760- 01:29.760* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 17th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:29.760- 01:34.480* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dissolving his war cabinet,
*01:34.480- 01:39.560* :  and is now expected to take decisions about the Gaza-Conflict ad-hoc with key allies.
*01:39.580- 01:45.160* :  And the BBC has heard testimony from witnesses who've blamed the Greek coast guard for the deaths
*01:45.180- 01:47.800* :  of dozens of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea.
*01:50.140- 01:54.920* :  Also in this podcast, Denmark says it's looking at additional ways of stopping Russian oil exports,
*01:54.920- 02:01.080* :  passing through its waters, the Ukrainians trying to conscript men to fight in the war against Russia,
*02:09.120- 02:13.040* :  and the K-pop band made up of hearing impaired singers.
*02:17.640- 02:22.960* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's dissolved the six-member war cabinet.
*02:22.960- 02:28.900* :  The move isn't entirely unexpected after the centrist former General Benny Gantz left it.
*02:28.900- 02:34.340* :  He complained that Mr. Netanyahu had failed to produce a post-war plan for Gaza.
*02:34.940- 02:40.280* :  A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces, Daniel Hagari, says Mr. Netanyahu's decision
*02:40.280- 02:42.160* :  doesn't change things for the military.
*02:42.720- 02:47.440* :  If the members of the cabinet are being changed, this is the decision of this democracy,
*02:47.440- 02:52.580* :  of this cabinet, of this Prime Minister, and we will keep acting according to the cabinet
*02:52.940- 02:56.480* :  according to the law, according to the international law.
*02:56.800- 03:00.880* :  This is what the idea of does, did, and will do in the future.
*03:01.580- 03:06.560* :  But the move comes as divisions appear to be deepening between Mr. Netanyahu and the military.
*03:07.100- 03:12.440* :  It's now observing what it calls daytime tactical pauses in a small part of southern Gaza
*03:12.860- 03:14.500* :  to enable aid to be delivered.
*03:15.020- 03:19.100* :  And that's prompted sharp criticism from the Prime Minister and some of his far-right
*03:19.100- 03:25.000* :  cabinet colleagues. The area is near the Kerem Shalom crossing from southern Israel into Gaza,
*03:25.540- 03:28.760* :  and our Middle East correspondent, Yolanael, has been there.
*03:29.300- 03:31.820* :  First, though, why has the war cabinet been dissolved?
*03:32.440- 03:34.420* :  This was really widely expected.
*03:34.420- 03:38.760* :  There were vacancies, obviously, in the war cabinets after Benny Gans,
*03:38.760- 03:44.540* :  the centrist former general left just over a week ago, and also along with his ally,
*03:44.540- 03:48.900* :  a Gavi Eisenkot, and two men who were known for their military experience.
*03:49.540- 03:53.460* :  And really, we've had a lot of calls from the finance minister,
*03:53.460- 03:55.800* :  Bezalel Smottrich, from the National Security Minister,
*03:55.800- 04:00.060* :  Itamar Ben-Gavir, nationalist religious partners in these
*04:00.060- 04:02.300* :  Israeli Prime Ministers governing coalition, of course.
*04:02.300- 04:06.100* :  They wanted to be included in the war cabinet involved in key decisions.
*04:06.640- 04:08.580* :  Now, that move, if it had gone ahead, would have been
*04:08.580- 04:12.180* :  difficult for Mr Netanyahu himself, but it really would have
*04:12.460- 04:14.780* :  caused a lot of strain with international allies,
*04:15.360- 04:17.100* :  in particular, of the United States.
*04:17.580- 04:20.780* :  So, I think he was getting himself out of a difficult situation here,
*04:21.200- 04:23.120* :  basically dissolving the war cabinet.
*04:23.120- 04:28.680* :  And what he says he'll do now is until consult about the Gaza war with a small group of ministers
*04:29.240- 04:31.860* :  that includes the defence minister, you have Golan,
*04:31.860- 04:33.980* :  the strategic affairs minister, Ron Durma,
*04:34.360- 04:36.000* :  both men who'd been in the war cabinet.
*04:36.300- 04:39.540* :  And you have been to the Kerem Shalom crossing today.
*04:39.540- 04:40.560* :  What's going on there?
*04:40.760- 04:42.280* :  I mean, it was striking to be there,
*04:42.280- 04:44.420* :  because the last time I was there was prior to the war,
*04:44.420- 04:47.300* :  when you just saw a constant stream of lorries arriving,
*04:47.300- 04:50.880* :  goods undergoing security checks and making their way in.
*04:50.940- 04:54.320* :  There was just a very small stream of lorries going in.
*04:54.320- 04:57.220* :  We were told by the Israeli military body Kogat,
*04:57.640- 05:01.140* :  which oversees the crossing that they had there,
*05:01.140- 05:06.900* :  something like 2,700 pallets waiting to be picked up that had undergone security checks.
*05:07.380- 05:09.980* :  I'm really putting the owners on humanitarian agencies,
*05:09.980- 05:15.920* :  in particular, the UN, to step up to what they see as the challenges on the other side.
*05:16.620- 05:20.780* :  Said that it was true that it was difficult to distribute aid in a war zone,
*05:20.780- 05:23.980* :  but there could be more done in terms of manpower and logistics
*05:24.640- 05:26.500* :  when it comes to the UN effort.
*05:26.500- 05:31.000* :  This is, of course, part of an ongoing debate that we have seen through this war,
*05:31.000- 05:35.080* :  where the Israeli military has put the blame on the UN,
*05:35.080- 05:37.520* :  in particular, for failure to distribute aid,
*05:38.000- 05:41.400* :  and then being enough aid to go around for civilians in Gaza.
*05:41.980- 05:47.320* :  But I did speak to a UN official who told me that they welcomed this tactical pause,
*05:47.800- 05:51.420* :  but still they'd been unable to take advantage of it in the two days
*05:51.420- 05:55.980* :  it's now been operating, saying that the situation is still quite uncertain.
*05:56.560- 06:00.100* :  They need more reassurances that there is this kind of safe stretch of road
*06:00.700- 06:03.280* :  near to the Kremlin, on board, crossing on the other side,
*06:03.280- 06:08.220* :  so that lorries can go in large numbers to pick up the aid that is waiting
*06:08.220- 06:11.380* :  and distribute it across central and southern Gaza.
*06:12.020- 06:12.880* :  That was Ilhan now.
*06:13.980- 06:18.360* :  The Greek coast guard has been accused of causing the deaths of dozens of migrants
*06:18.360- 06:21.200* :  in the Mediterranean over a three-year period.
*06:21.700- 06:25.100* :  The BBC has been told that that number includes nine people
*06:25.100- 06:27.300* :  who are deliberately thrown into the water.
*06:27.900- 06:31.740* :  BBC analysis has found that more than 40 people are alleged to have died
*06:31.740- 06:34.940* :  as a result of being forced out of Greek territorial waters
*06:35.500- 06:38.960* :  or taken back out to sea after reaching Greek islands.
*06:38.960- 06:41.560* :  The Greek coast guard rejects the claims.
*06:42.220- 06:45.800* :  This report is by our population correspondent, Stephanie Hegati.
*06:49.880- 06:52.040* :  The soldiers, they are searching for us.
*06:52.420- 06:55.500* :  Do you hear how they are shouting?
*06:56.240- 06:56.760* :  They are shooting.
*06:57.080- 06:59.160* :  They are shooting live ammunition.
*07:00.780- 07:03.820* :  These are audio recordings of the moment Ibrahim's boat
*07:03.820- 07:07.440* :  reached the Greek island of Samas, after crossing from Turkey.
*07:08.440- 07:09.660* :  He's now a refugee.
*07:10.980- 07:14.060* :  They were two policemen dressed in black
*07:14.300- 07:16.620* :  and three others in civilian clothes.
*07:22.720- 07:25.040* :  Ibrahim says he was beaten and stripped searched
*07:25.560- 07:29.100* :  and that the Greek coast guard took him and two other men out to sea.
*07:33.840- 07:35.200* :  They started with the camera room yet.
*07:38.140- 07:39.040* :  They threw him in the water.
*07:39.040- 07:39.860* :  They threw him in the water.
*07:42.180- 07:43.360* :  They threw him in the water.
*07:43.500- 07:45.600* :  The effluent said, save me.
*07:45.920- 07:46.800* :  I don't want to die.
*07:47.260- 07:47.740* :  Save me.
*07:53.700- 07:55.320* :  He shot you and forced him quite.
*07:55.620- 07:57.400* :  An incredible strength animated me.
*07:59.660- 08:00.220* :  I survived.
*08:02.740- 08:05.660* :  He swam to safety, but the other two men died.
*08:06.380- 08:09.120* :  We've heard allegations of a total of five separate incidents
*08:09.120- 08:12.420* :  in which people were thrown into the sea by the Greek coast guard.
*08:13.140- 08:15.000* :  In all, nine of them died.
*08:15.940- 08:18.340* :  In a statement, the Greek coast guard strongly rejected
*08:18.340- 08:20.400* :  all accusations of illegal activities
*08:21.100- 08:23.820* :  and questioned the veracity of the testimonies we've gathered.
*08:26.880- 08:29.380* :  But last year, another incident was caught on camera
*08:30.000- 08:31.380* :  by activist, Firemulla.
*08:32.100- 08:34.680* :  It showed men in masks, forcing 12 people,
*08:34.960- 08:36.380* :  including women and young children,
*08:36.880- 08:38.280* :  onto a Greek coast guard vessel.
*08:39.420- 08:41.820* :  They then set a drift in a motorless raft,
*08:42.420- 08:44.500* :  abandoned just outside Greek waters.
*08:46.680- 08:49.340* :  They were found later by a Turkish patrol boat
*08:49.940- 08:52.820* :  and an official investigation by Greece is ongoing.
*08:56.360- 08:59.520* :  The Greek authorities didn't agree to be interviewed for this report,
*09:00.480- 09:03.640* :  but we showed this video to a former head of special operations
*09:03.660- 09:06.820* :  at the Greek coast guard, Demetrius Balticos.
*09:08.160- 09:10.780* :  I can see people getting on board the vessel.
*09:12.920- 09:16.560* :  It doesn't seem like it's forceful.
*09:17.800- 09:19.600* :  Can you see any soil children?
*09:21.960- 09:22.720* :  Yes, now I can.
*09:23.160- 09:23.980* :  That's something that happens.
*09:24.820- 09:27.000* :  Migrants traveling, the agency,
*09:27.880- 09:29.500* :  very often they abandon the children.
*09:30.460- 09:31.880* :  They don't seem to have the same
*09:34.520- 09:37.560* :  affection that we have for children.
*09:43.960- 09:44.920* :  A few moments later,
*09:45.380- 09:47.680* :  he spoke to someone who was off camera in Greek.
*09:48.500- 09:50.200* :  His mic was still recording.
*09:52.080- 09:52.860* :  I haven't told them much.
*09:53.320- 09:53.740* :  What do you think?
*09:54.360- 09:55.180* :  Take out the answer, thanks.
*09:55.760- 09:57.000* :  Yes, it's crystal clear.
*09:57.440- 09:58.360* :  But what should I tell them?
*09:58.660- 10:01.440* :  When you look at it from the outside, it's very clear, isn't it?
*10:01.840- 10:03.000* :  It's not nuclear physics.
*10:04.240- 10:05.640* :  I don't know why they did it in broad daylight.
*10:06.880- 10:07.940* :  It's clearly illegal.
*10:09.280- 10:10.400* :  Obviously, obviously illegal.
*10:10.680- 10:12.680* :  It's an international crime.
*10:15.320- 10:18.100* :  In a statement, the Greek coast guard said they worked tirelessly
*10:18.380- 10:19.880* :  with the utmost professionalism,
*10:20.440- 10:21.760* :  a strong sense of responsibility,
*10:22.420- 10:25.340* :  and respect for human life and fundamental rights.
*10:26.780- 10:27.700* :  Stephanie Hegati,
*10:28.160- 10:31.540* :  and that is from a new BBC documentary, Dead Calm,
*10:32.200- 10:32.920* :  Killing in the Med.
*10:34.780- 10:37.920* :  After years of chilly relations between Australia and China,
*10:38.240- 10:40.560* :  the two countries are seeking to improve ties,
*10:40.940- 10:43.900* :  with the visit to Australia by the Chinese Premier Liu Chang.
*10:44.640- 10:47.420* :  It's the first visit by a Chinese leader in seven years.
*10:48.140- 10:50.180* :  Relations between the two countries hit a low point
*10:50.500- 10:52.780* :  when Australia called for an international inquiry
*10:52.780- 10:54.920* :  into the origins of the Covid pandemic.
*10:55.460- 10:57.260* :  China responded with trade sanctions.
*10:57.960- 11:00.140* :  But both countries say they are determined
*11:00.140- 11:02.240* :  to keep developing their relationship.
*11:02.240- 11:05.140* :  Here's the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese.
*11:05.740- 11:08.320* :  I've made it clear as nations with different histories,
*11:08.940- 11:10.280* :  political systems and values.
*11:11.040- 11:13.220* :  We will cooperate with China where we can,
*11:13.820- 11:17.200* :  disagree where we must and engage in the national interest.
*11:18.040- 11:21.040* :  We have a lot to do and a lot to look forward to.
*11:21.520- 11:23.520* :  And Mr Liu seems just as positive.
*11:24.160- 11:27.580* :  I've just moved from Albanese to China.
*11:28.120- 11:30.800* :  Prime Minister Albanese and I had a candid,
*11:31.200- 11:35.000* :  in-depth and fruitful meeting and reached a lot of consensus.
*11:35.840- 11:39.380* :  We reaffirmed our commitment to defining this relationship
*11:39.920- 11:42.200* :  as a comprehensive strategic partnership
*11:42.880- 11:44.540* :  to mutual respect and trust
*11:45.160- 11:47.780* :  and to viewing and handling this relationship
*11:48.220- 11:49.460* :  in a positive attitude.
*11:51.420- 11:54.100* :  This assessment from our Sydney Co-respondent Katie Watson.
*11:54.900- 11:57.660* :  When Mr Liu landed, he said that the relationship
*11:57.660- 12:00.060* :  between the two countries was back on track.
*12:00.540- 12:03.260* :  He also said that Australia and China
*12:03.260- 12:05.120* :  have an evergreen relationship.
*12:05.120- 12:07.900* :  I think what this is doing is trying to get back
*12:07.900- 12:11.260* :  to some kind of normality after seven very difficult years.
*12:11.500- 12:13.240* :  And he said that he talked about this idea
*12:13.240- 12:15.700* :  being an evergreen relationship which speaks volumes
*12:15.700- 12:18.300* :  because China and Australia have a relationship
*12:18.300- 12:20.060* :  that's very important to both countries.
*12:20.480- 12:23.400* :  China is Australia's largest trading partner
*12:23.400- 12:24.540* :  by a long way.
*12:24.540- 12:27.180* :  China wants the resources that Australia has.
*12:27.260- 12:29.540* :  So they know that they've got a lot to lose
*12:29.540- 12:32.540* :  if they don't remain friends in some way.
*12:32.680- 12:34.960* :  So it's significant in that sense,
*12:34.960- 12:39.240* :  just trying to get back to a more stable and friendly footing.
*12:39.600- 12:40.960* :  So an evergreen relationship,
*12:40.960- 12:42.600* :  but was it actually on the agenda?
*12:42.600- 12:43.420* :  What was discussed?
*12:44.160- 12:45.880* :  There was less what's been talked about
*12:45.880- 12:48.000* :  and more what this looks like in the Arctic.
*12:48.020- 12:50.560* :  So there was discussion about Australia taking part
*12:50.580- 12:52.340* :  in a visa waiver program.
*12:52.340- 12:54.040* :  There was some memorandums of understanding
*12:54.040- 12:56.560* :  that was signed on issues such as climate,
*12:56.560- 12:58.680* :  on education, and research.
*12:59.300- 13:02.040* :  There was talk, certainly Mr. Albanese
*13:02.040- 13:04.740* :  said that he did raise issues of human rights.
*13:04.780- 13:06.000* :  That was one of the big criticisms
*13:06.000- 13:09.160* :  that this visit would not talk about human rights issues
*13:09.240- 13:11.240* :  and it was being focusing on trade
*13:11.240- 13:14.500* :  and we've seen protesters accompany the two men
*13:14.880- 13:15.560* :  in their talks.
*13:15.900- 13:17.680* :  Mr. Albanese said he did raise
*13:17.680- 13:21.000* :  the issue of Yang Heng Jun, who is a blogger
*13:21.000- 13:24.160* :  who was given a suspended death sentence in China
*13:24.560- 13:27.600* :  just a few months ago over espionage charges.
*13:27.960- 13:29.420* :  You know, these things were discussed,
*13:29.640- 13:32.920* :  but really this is very much about trying to resume
*13:32.920- 13:35.640* :  a slightly friendlier face and try and work together
*13:36.240- 13:36.980* :  and have dialogue.
*13:37.020- 13:38.660* :  That's what Mr. Albanese said.
*13:38.660- 13:41.080* :  It dialogue was an important word after
*13:41.440- 13:42.640* :  the previous government perhaps
*13:42.980- 13:44.860* :  was a much more frosty relationship with China.
*13:45.120- 13:46.280* :  There was some awkwardness.
*13:46.300- 13:46.920* :  There wasn't there.
*13:46.920- 13:49.660* :  Chinese officials stood in front of a formally detained
*13:49.660- 13:51.180* :  Australian journalist, Cheng Lei.
*13:52.060- 13:53.880* :  Absolutely, so that's signing ceremony
*13:53.880- 13:56.060* :  and this has been this kind of as overshadowed
*13:56.060- 13:58.500* :  really the visits, certainly today.
*13:59.020- 14:01.740* :  That some Chinese embassy staff
*14:01.800- 14:03.160* :  kind of stood in the way,
*14:03.160- 14:06.780* :  blocked her from being filmed in the same shot as Mr. Lee
*14:06.780- 14:10.000* :  and the Australian officials trying to move them on
*14:10.020- 14:10.920* :  but that didn't happen.
*14:10.920- 14:13.660* :  It was really awkward people who have said
*14:13.660- 14:15.360* :  is this what China does?
*14:15.420- 14:17.580* :  It's not really looking at freedom of expression
*14:17.700- 14:20.500* :  and that certainly has put a bit of a shadow
*14:20.500- 14:22.140* :  on the events of today.
*14:22.540- 14:23.140* :  Katie Watson.
*14:23.900- 14:26.920* :  Police in Zimbabwe have arrested an opposition leader
*14:26.920- 14:30.060* :  and dozens of activists for holding a political meeting.
*14:30.680- 14:33.060* :  Aloya said more than 70 people were arrested
*14:33.060- 14:35.460* :  at Jamison Timber's home on Sunday.
*14:35.920- 14:37.560* :  Shenganyoka reports from Harare.
*14:37.960- 14:39.720* :  Party youth leaders were holding a meeting
*14:39.720- 14:42.140* :  to mark the international day of the African child
*14:42.140- 14:44.800* :  when without warning police stormed the property,
*14:45.260- 14:46.780* :  tear gas and arrested the group
*14:46.780- 14:49.080* :  according to their lawyer, Agency Gumball.
*14:49.480- 14:51.380* :  The property owner, Jamison Timber,
*14:51.380- 14:53.480* :  a senior figure in the CCC party
*14:53.480- 14:56.220* :  who was not at the meeting was arrested separately.
*14:56.820- 14:59.180* :  While the police said the group did not seek clearance
*14:59.180- 15:01.820* :  to hold the meeting, Mr. Gumball told the BBC
*15:01.820- 15:04.280* :  that this was an internal private meeting
*15:04.280- 15:05.800* :  rather than a public gathering
*15:05.800- 15:07.940* :  and as such did not require clearance.
*15:07.940- 15:11.040* :  The group is expected to appear in court on Tuesday.
*15:11.680- 15:12.600* :  That was Shenganyoka.
*15:13.800- 15:16.900* :  An annual report into digital news consumption
*15:17.060- 15:19.720* :  based on a survey of nearly 100,000 people
*15:19.720- 15:21.320* :  in 47 countries
*15:21.840- 15:24.860* :  is suggesting that more people are actively turning away
*15:24.860- 15:25.700* :  from the news.
*15:26.260- 15:27.840* :  It also has some interesting findings
*15:27.840- 15:30.080* :  on the role of tech company choices
*15:30.660- 15:32.780* :  and the increasing appeal of short video.
*15:33.320- 15:35.600* :  Nick Newman is a senior research associate
*15:35.600- 15:38.240* :  at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism
*15:38.480- 15:40.060* :  and the lead author of the report.
*15:40.500- 15:42.500* :  And he spoke to Michelle Hussain about what he found.
*15:43.180- 15:45.940* :  One of the key points is this declining interest
*15:45.940- 15:47.340* :  that we see in news
*15:47.620- 15:50.480* :  and increasing numbers of people selectively avoiding it.
*15:50.540- 15:53.000* :  So the global figure for that is 39%.
*15:53.760- 15:57.320* :  Who say they sometimes or often actively avoid the news
*15:57.320- 15:59.760* :  which is kind of double where it was in 2017.
*16:00.760- 16:03.300* :  And part of that is obviously the negative nature
*16:03.500- 16:05.500* :  of the news agenda people have lived through
*16:06.080- 16:07.380* :  through COVID, cost of living,
*16:07.380- 16:10.020* :  you've got the wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza.
*16:10.980- 16:14.740* :  So people talk to us about one real respondent in the UK
*16:14.740- 16:17.160* :  says how are we supposed to function as a society
*16:17.160- 16:19.580* :  when all we see are the bad things in life.
*16:20.160- 16:22.880* :  Other people talk about world news being too depressing
*16:23.600- 16:26.080* :  and it can have a negative impact on the mental health.
*16:26.240- 16:29.700* :  So I think that is the way in which media companies
*16:29.700- 16:33.280* :  can connect with audiences is really top of mind right now.
*16:33.460- 16:35.980* :  Tell me more about what you found on tech companies
*16:35.980- 16:39.380* :  and algorithms and that some I see from your report
*16:39.380- 16:43.620* :  and now explicitly deprioritising news and political content,
*16:43.620- 16:46.900* :  others switching focus from publishers to creators.
*16:47.600- 16:51.240* :  Is this in response to what they're seeing in surveys like yours?
*16:52.560- 16:55.300* :  Partly, I mean certainly, you know, Facebook is trying to
*16:55.560- 16:57.440* :  compete with other platforms like TikTok.
*16:57.500- 16:59.900* :  So it's really trying to engage young people
*16:59.900- 17:02.400* :  and maybe showing news is not the best way of doing that.
*17:02.400- 17:05.080* :  So they have been deliberately deprioritising
*17:05.400- 17:07.560* :  and news about politics and news about hard news in general
*17:08.020- 17:10.680* :  and pushing into sort of creators and video content
*17:10.720- 17:13.960* :  and then of course you also have the rise of video platforms
*17:13.960- 17:18.440* :  like TikTok and YouTube playing a much bigger role in news distribution
*17:19.160- 17:21.620* :  and we've seen that of course in the UK election.
*17:21.660- 17:24.400* :  We've seen it in European elections where Jordan,
*17:24.620- 17:27.800* :  Badella for example, runs a very successful TikTok account
*17:27.800- 17:30.280* :  and is really sort of connected with young people
*17:30.280- 17:33.100* :  and we've seen that in Argentina, Indonesia
*17:33.100- 17:34.560* :  and over range of other countries as well.
*17:34.880- 17:37.180* :  Have you come to conclusions Nick about what organizations
*17:37.220- 17:39.420* :  like this can do in the face of this?
*17:39.500- 17:42.060* :  Is it a question about how you package news
*17:42.060- 17:46.160* :  or doing more good news stories because the tough stuff is important
*17:46.300- 17:48.160* :  and it's important for citizenship here.
*17:48.160- 17:52.280* :  It's important for how, you know, just knowledge of the world around you.
*17:53.560- 17:57.620* :  It is important and, you know, I think audiences don't want
*17:57.620- 17:59.720* :  traditional media to dumb down.
*17:59.720- 18:02.040* :  They just want the sort of broader range of things you find now
*18:02.040- 18:05.240* :  in social media and often creators are involved with.
*18:05.720- 18:07.220* :  But I think for traditional media companies,
*18:07.220- 18:10.200* :  it's partly about sort of really being much more focused on audiences,
*18:11.140- 18:14.400* :  explaining the news much better, you know, trying to simplify
*18:14.400- 18:15.800* :  or at least make it more accessible.
*18:16.380- 18:18.500* :  Use some of these new formats that we talked about, you know,
*18:18.720- 18:22.540* :  short form video and more constructive approaches to the news.
*18:22.540- 18:24.640* :  I think many people have already had enough of sort of
*18:25.100- 18:27.300* :  the negative frames that the media often employ
*18:27.300- 18:30.300* :  so providing more constructive or solutions based journalists
*18:30.420- 18:32.760* :  and it's one thing that the publishers are trying.
*18:33.480- 18:34.360* :  And that was Nick Newman.
*18:37.060- 18:38.420* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*18:43.240- 18:46.880* :  Big ocean, the K-pop band refusing to let hearing impairment
*18:47.280- 18:48.600* :  get in the way of their music.

*19:10.720- 19:12.040* :  automate allowance and more.
*19:12.040- 19:15.420* :  Plus, keep an eye on spending with real-time notifications.
*19:16.180- 19:18.340* :  Join more than six million parents and kids

*19:28.000- 19:29.700* :  So how do we get AI right?
*19:30.140- 19:32.620* :  Well, we need the right volume of data,
*19:33.020- 19:34.300* :  the software to train it,
*19:34.620- 19:37.420* :  and massive compute power or...
*19:37.500- 19:38.880* :  Another one bites the dust.
*19:39.620- 19:40.100* :  Are you ready?
*19:40.100- 19:41.600* :  Hey, are you ready for this?
*19:41.860- 19:43.260* :  Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
*19:43.380- 19:44.760* :  But with HPE Greenlight,
*19:44.760- 19:47.280* :  we get access to supercomputing to power AI
*19:47.280- 19:48.220* :  at the scale we need,
*19:48.380- 19:49.840* :  helping generate better insights.
*19:50.200- 19:51.340* :  All right.
*19:53.060- 19:53.940* :  Nice teamwork, guys.
*19:54.540- 19:55.520* :  Search HPE Greenlight.
*20:02.960- 20:05.900* :  About a third of Russian oil transported by sea
*20:05.900- 20:08.740* :  passes through the Baltic Sea and Danish waters
*20:09.240- 20:11.420* :  using tankers which conceal their identity
*20:11.420- 20:13.700* :  to avoid detection and sanctions.
*20:13.820- 20:17.400* :  The tankers bring in huge amounts of revenue for Russia,
*20:17.840- 20:19.580* :  but they pose a risk to the environment
*20:19.580- 20:23.060* :  as they are often old and sometimes unseeworthy.
*20:23.580- 20:25.900* :  Now Denmark has announced its considering ways
*20:26.020- 20:28.700* :  to limit the tankers' passage through its waters.
*20:29.460- 20:32.720* :  Europe Regional Editor Nikki Cardwell told us more
*20:32.720- 20:34.900* :  about what are known as shadow vessels.
*20:35.600- 20:36.960* :  They're very old ships.
*20:37.020- 20:38.360* :  They're generally at the end of their life
*20:38.360- 20:40.780* :  and in many cases have actually been retired
*20:40.780- 20:43.440* :  and they've been bought back into service just for this.
*20:43.500- 20:45.880* :  So just to give you an idea of what that means,
*20:45.880- 20:49.560* :  the average life span of an oil tanker is 20, 25 years.
*20:50.020- 20:53.240* :  The average age of tankers coming out of Clinton grad
*20:53.240- 20:55.900* :  which is Russia's Baltic Sea port is 30,
*20:55.900- 20:59.460* :  so they are old and have been described as rust buckets
*20:59.460- 21:00.600* :  to use the colloquial term.
*21:01.020- 21:02.720* :  They're often registered in countries
*21:02.740- 21:04.160* :  that are also facing sanctions
*21:04.760- 21:08.840* :  or who do not respond to the international maritime rules.
*21:09.360- 21:12.120* :  The shadow element, if it comes from when they travel
*21:12.560- 21:14.220* :  because they want to do it inconspicuously,
*21:14.220- 21:17.160* :  they turn off beacons and any identification
*21:17.580- 21:19.200* :  and they're not letting people know they're there
*21:19.200- 21:21.980* :  which makes it a little bit difficult and dangerous
*21:22.740- 21:24.920* :  and they also refuse the help of local pilots.
*21:24.920- 21:26.920* :  It's current practice that if you go through
*21:27.240- 21:29.020* :  particularly difficult piece of water
*21:29.460- 21:31.880* :  that you ask for help from a local pilot
*21:32.280- 21:34.000* :  and these ships will actively refuse that
*21:34.000- 21:36.680* :  because they don't want to be on anybody's radar.
*21:37.040- 21:38.560* :  So why is their mark doing this now?
*21:39.340- 21:40.460* :  There's two elements to it.
*21:40.460- 21:41.660* :  The first is environmental.
*21:42.000- 21:44.540* :  Back in March there was a collision involving
*21:44.540- 21:48.720* :  one of these tankers off the northern coast of Denmark.
*21:50.000- 21:52.440* :  Luckily it was empty, didn't have any oil on it.
*21:52.480- 21:53.580* :  It was actually going to pick it up.
*21:54.020- 21:55.840* :  So the damage was minimal
*21:55.840- 21:58.740* :  but it could have been a major incident if that had happened.
*21:59.120- 22:00.400* :  So that's just one of the concerns
*22:00.400- 22:03.560* :  and this piece of water that they're traveling through
*22:03.560- 22:05.040* :  in Denmark, the Denmark Straits,
*22:05.280- 22:07.060* :  are actually quite difficult to navigate
*22:07.680- 22:09.080* :  and there are concerns about that.
*22:09.300- 22:11.200* :  But the main one is sanctions.
*22:11.320- 22:12.780* :  Is the sanctions avoidance?
*22:12.940- 22:14.760* :  Just briefly, can they stop these ships?
*22:15.300- 22:16.220* :  Yes, they can.
*22:17.140- 22:19.540* :  Under maritime law, any think that is thought
*22:19.540- 22:22.720* :  to be an environmental threat can be stopped and checked.
*22:22.720- 22:25.700* :  So they will, any ship that doesn't have western insurance
*22:25.760- 22:27.760* :  which was one of the conditions of the sanctions
*22:28.300- 22:30.800* :  could be stopped and they will check it
*22:30.800- 22:32.240* :  under the environmental rules.
*22:32.740- 22:33.720* :  That was Nikki Cardwell.
*22:34.620- 22:37.740* :  Ukraine is facing one of its most perilous moments
*22:37.740- 22:39.960* :  since the start of the full-scale invasion.
*22:40.560- 22:43.660* :  Russia with its superior manpower is on the offensive.
*22:44.300- 22:47.320* :  The Ukrainian army desperately needs to enlist more men
*22:47.880- 22:49.700* :  but more than two years into the war,
*22:50.000- 22:52.420* :  it's struggling to find willing volunteers.
*22:53.100- 22:56.300* :  The army has embarked on a new round of mobilization,
*22:56.780- 22:59.020* :  men now have until the middle of July
*22:59.020- 23:02.140* :  to log their details on an electronic database
*23:02.560- 23:03.820* :  so they can be called up.
*23:04.260- 23:07.960* :  This has pushed some of those who don't want to fight into hiding
*23:07.960- 23:10.660* :  as our correspondent Jean McKenzie reports
*23:10.660- 23:12.340* :  from the city of Odessa.
*23:13.040- 23:14.640* :  More than two years into this war,
*23:14.640- 23:17.480* :  Ukraine is vastly outnumbered on the battlefield.
*23:18.020- 23:20.200* :  The army desperately needs more soldiers
*23:20.400- 23:21.700* :  if it's to stay in this fight.
*23:23.180- 23:25.920* :  And so now all men between 25 and 60
*23:26.300- 23:28.300* :  must register so they can be called up.
*23:29.100- 23:31.400* :  And because of this, many have gone into hiding.
*23:39.020- 23:41.040* :  Sova meets me at the door of his apartment
*23:41.940- 23:43.240* :  but we head upstairs quickly.
*23:48.440- 23:50.940* :  These days he only leaves the house with his daughter
*23:51.240- 23:53.900* :  because he knows he won't get picked up if they're together.
*23:53.900- 23:54.760* :  One more one's open.
*23:55.680- 23:57.080* :  Check out dots.
*23:57.840- 24:00.820* :  But before they go for a walk, he has the check social media.
*24:01.420- 24:04.180* :  So these groups are telling you where the enlistant officers are?
*24:04.340- 24:07.360* :  Yeah, where is the steady, what are they doing?
*24:07.660- 24:09.400* :  So you wouldn't feel safe to leave the house
*24:09.440- 24:13.640* :  until you checked this group to see where the officers are?
*24:14.840- 24:18.980* :  The Ukrainian army says that it needs people like you to fight
*24:19.880- 24:21.200* :  if it is to win this war.
*24:21.740- 24:23.640* :  What do you want for the future of your country?
*24:27.640- 24:28.840* :  Switching to speak in Russian.
*24:28.840- 24:31.280* :  Father tells me he's not a military man.
*24:31.280- 24:32.680* :  He's never held a weapon.
*24:33.360- 24:35.840* :  He doesn't think he'd be useful on the front line
*24:36.180- 24:38.460* :  and he's certain that's where he'd be sent.
*24:44.740- 24:46.900* :  Around a dozen soldiers have just descended
*24:47.220- 24:49.360* :  on the train station in the center of Odessa.
*24:49.980- 24:53.060* :  These recruitment officers are stopping men
*24:53.120- 24:54.900* :  who look as if they're serving age
*24:55.320- 24:56.960* :  and asking to check their documents.
*25:00.200- 25:02.220* :  These guys have a pretty fierce reputation
*25:02.220- 25:05.820* :  for grabbing people off the streets of public transport
*25:05.820- 25:08.720* :  and taking them straight to enlistment centers.
*25:09.760- 25:13.280* :  Are you part of the problem because people are hiding from you.
*25:13.380- 25:14.300* :  They're scared of you.
*25:17.320- 25:19.720* :  Look, some people react aggressively towards us.
*25:19.940- 25:21.880* :  Others run away from us.
*25:22.360- 25:23.260* :  This happens often.
*25:24.040- 25:26.520* :  I don't think these people have been well brought up.
*25:29.220- 25:31.760* :  I've come around the corner to the enlistment center
*25:32.140- 25:34.360* :  which is where the men who get their summons
*25:34.740- 25:38.000* :  have to come register and be declared fit to serve.
*25:38.660- 25:43.180* :  We've just heard there's a threat of a ballistic missile
*25:43.260- 25:45.660* :  so we're having to move now to the shelter.
*25:48.120- 25:51.280* :  Down in the bunker I meet Vlad, a commander in the Ukrainian army.
*25:51.540- 25:54.760* :  He's been serving on the front line in the Donbass in the east
*25:55.240- 25:56.900* :  but he was badly injured by Shrapnel
*25:57.320- 25:59.300* :  and so he's working here while he recovers.
*26:00.180- 26:03.380* :  How does it make you feel knowing what's happening on the front line
*26:03.380- 26:05.240* :  and what you have done to serve
*26:05.940- 26:08.480* :  that so many people now are so reluctant to?
*26:11.440- 26:14.120* :  These men who are hiding, I don't consider them men.
*26:14.640- 26:15.560* :  What are they waiting for?
*26:16.460- 26:19.620* :  If we run out of men, the enemy will come to their homes,
*26:20.340- 26:22.580* :  they will rape their women and kill their children.
*26:23.280- 26:26.200* :  All across the desert there are these recruitment posters
*26:26.820- 26:29.460* :  and one of them reads together to victory.
*26:30.380- 26:31.220* :  But this is the problem.
*26:31.560- 26:33.700* :  People here are no longer together.
*26:34.180- 26:36.600* :  United, it's like they were at the start of the war.
*26:37.240- 26:39.680* :  There is now this very clear division
*26:40.380- 26:42.840* :  between those who are prepared to face the front line
*26:43.460- 26:44.940* :  and those who would rather run and hide.
*26:46.680- 26:51.180* :  Jean McKenzie, a study shows that the world's nuclear powers
*26:51.180- 26:55.700* :  spent more than $91 billion on nuclear weapons last year.
*26:56.040- 27:00.200* :  That's an increase of 10 billion or 13% on the previous year.
*27:00.800- 27:03.460* :  The international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons
*27:03.920- 27:05.560* :  which produces the report annually
*27:05.560- 27:08.080* :  describes the sums as obscene
*27:08.420- 27:10.000* :  and says it's wasted money
*27:10.320- 27:13.280* :  which could be far better spent tackling climate change.
*27:13.680- 27:15.320* :  Imagine folks reports from Geneva.
*27:16.080- 27:18.280* :  Even the countries which have nuclear weapons
*27:18.280- 27:20.160* :  agree they should never be used
*27:20.640- 27:23.020* :  and a war involving them could never be won
*27:23.540- 27:27.040* :  but amid growing tension between the world's big powers
*27:27.040- 27:29.820* :  they are spending more and more on them.
*27:30.180- 27:32.180* :  The United States tops the league
*27:32.180- 27:36.380* :  spending more than $50 billion on nuclear weapons last year
*27:36.380- 27:39.520* :  followed by China at almost $12 billion
*27:39.920- 27:41.760* :  and then Russia and the United Kingdom
*27:41.760- 27:44.160* :  at just over $8 billion each.
*27:44.840- 27:47.860* :  The international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons
*27:47.960- 27:51.200* :  which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017
*27:51.220- 27:53.480* :  for its work to prohibit them
*27:53.480- 27:58.780* :  says the money spent benefits no one except arms companies and lobbyists.
*27:59.300- 28:02.300* :  $90 billion could pay for renewable energy
*28:02.300- 28:04.280* :  for millions of homes it says
*28:04.860- 28:07.360* :  and it urges governments to invest the money
*28:07.360- 28:10.540* :  to benefit humanity rather than threaten it.
*28:10.940- 28:12.060* :  That was Emerton folks.
*28:13.200- 28:16.000* :  Something new is happening in the world of K-pop
*28:16.320- 28:18.140* :  a band named Big Ocean.
*28:24.340- 28:27.120* :  They are a K-pop group composed entirely
*28:27.120- 28:28.900* :  of hearing impaired singers
*28:29.480- 28:33.360* :  Hyo-jung Kim is a reporter with the BBC Korean Service in Seoul.
*28:33.900- 28:37.580* :  The Big Ocean consists of three members
*28:38.140- 28:42.940* :  rapper Chan-yeon, main vocalist Hyun-jin and rapper Jisok.
*28:43.420- 28:46.900* :  Each member of the group experienced hearing laws
*28:46.900- 28:50.040* :  at different points in their lives.
*28:50.320- 28:53.280* :  They were scouted and trained for two years
*28:53.740- 28:59.600* :  by Parasta Entertainment, known for its dedication to artist with disabilities.
*29:00.400- 29:04.120* :  And I asked why they decided to take this tough path
*29:04.120- 29:07.360* :  because becoming idol is very tough here in South Korea.
*29:08.020- 29:12.440* :  They answered that they wanted to pursue their passion and aspirations.
*29:14.940- 29:18.840* :  When I was three years old, I had a high fever that affected my hearing.
*29:19.180- 29:22.980* :  I was diagnosed with a hearing disability
*29:22.980- 29:24.760* :  in my second year of high school.
*29:29.260- 29:32.620* :  If we assume that full hearing is 100%,
*29:32.700- 29:36.680* :  I can hear about 60% to 70% with the health of a hearing aid.
*29:42.220- 29:44.760* :  I wear a hearing aid and I also use a cochlear implant.
*29:45.260- 29:47.040* :  I can't hear anything with my left ear.
*29:47.560- 29:49.600* :  And my right ear only has a little hearing left.
*29:53.200- 29:55.860* :  My mom was very shocked so she had my hearing tested
*29:56.300- 29:57.700* :  multiple times at different places.
*29:57.960- 30:00.100* :  And I think she eventually came to terms with it.
*30:03.760- 30:05.220* :  When I take out my hearing aids,
*30:06.020- 30:08.920* :  it's like I'm in a silent underwater world.
*30:10.980- 30:13.720* :  And tell me how it works because obviously, I mean,
*30:14.180- 30:18.520* :  singing is challenging enough for those of us
*30:18.520- 30:21.320* :  who are lucky not to have hearing impairments.
*30:21.320- 30:23.880* :  But how does it work for them?
*30:23.880- 30:25.240* :  How do they sing together?
*30:25.240- 30:27.440* :  How do they sing in harmony?
*30:28.040- 30:29.360* :  When it comes to dancing,
*30:30.020- 30:32.460* :  they use a lot of AI devices.
*30:33.080- 30:34.920* :  Actually, they perceive sound differently.
*30:35.520- 30:40.740* :  For instance, they use large displays showing numbers to indicate it.
*30:41.500- 30:45.560* :  And they also use wristwatch like metronomes
*30:45.620- 30:47.620* :  that vibrate to keep them in rhythm.
*30:48.500- 30:50.280* :  However, they don't wear these watches
*30:50.560- 30:52.280* :  during their actual performances
*30:52.820- 30:54.820* :  because they've practiced enough to remember
*30:54.820- 30:56.640* :  all the fits and rhythms.
*30:57.020- 31:02.120* :  Tianjin told me that they use the wristwatch like metronomes.
*31:05.300- 31:07.180* :  The smartwatch you see here is vibrational.
*31:07.740- 31:10.680* :  The rhythm of the song is transmitted individually to each of us,
*31:10.900- 31:14.260* :  making it easier for us to perceive the beat even more dancing.
*31:17.120- 31:19.400* :  Since it's hard for me to hit the exact pitch,
*31:19.820- 31:21.460* :  there's a device that shows the pitch.
*31:21.880- 31:23.260* :  I sing while looking at that screen,
*31:23.620- 31:26.160* :  and I also use AI to correct the deficiencies.
*31:27.100- 31:30.880* :  When we think about K-pop, I guess we often think about the sort of
*31:31.700- 31:36.600* :  people's idea of perfect young pop stars, perfect young idols.
*31:36.600- 31:42.480* :  And to have people with disabilities is something a little bit new,
*31:42.480- 31:43.440* :  a little bit different.
*31:43.440- 31:49.320* :  Tell me how they have been received by the Korean public.
*31:50.020- 31:52.420* :  Yeah, this market is very competitive
*31:52.620- 31:55.840* :  and many either groups debut each year,
*31:55.840- 31:57.220* :  but only a few survive.
*31:57.800- 32:00.520* :  But the response has been enthusiastic.
*32:01.440- 32:04.800* :  Many Korean media outlets have introduced their debut
*32:05.960- 32:09.040* :  and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
*32:17.920- 32:20.460* :  Jo Joon Kim was speaking to Tim Franks.
*32:23.300- 32:24.360* :  And that's it from us for now,
*32:24.360- 32:27.000* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:27.380- 32:30.700* :  If you would like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it,

*32:45.660- 32:48.140* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and until next time, goodbye.
*32:57.400- 32:59.140* :  So how do we get AI right?
*32:59.560- 33:02.060* :  Well, we need the right volume of data,
*33:02.380- 33:06.820* :  the software to train it and massive compute power or...
*33:12.880- 33:14.280* :  But with HPE GreenLake,
*33:14.280- 33:17.640* :  we get access to supercomputing to power AI at the scale we need,
*33:17.640- 33:19.260* :  helping generate better insights.
