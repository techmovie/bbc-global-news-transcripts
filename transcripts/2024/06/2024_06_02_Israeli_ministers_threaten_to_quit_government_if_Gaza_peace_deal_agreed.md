*01:23.420- 01:25.880* :  I'm Janut Julio and in the early hours of Sunday,
*01:25.880- 01:27.980* :  the 2nd of June, these are our main stories.
*01:28.680- 01:30.640* :  Leading right wing figures in the Israeli government
*01:30.640- 01:33.300* :  have threatened to pull out if Benjamin Netanyahu
*01:33.480- 01:36.320* :  agrees to a peace plan announced by President Biden.
*01:37.120- 01:40.560* :  Boeing's efforts to send astronauts to the International Space Station
*01:40.560- 01:44.980* :  have suffered another setback with a launch being stopped at the last minute.
*01:45.800- 01:50.180* :  Poles have closed in India after the biggest general election ever held.
*01:52.880- 01:53.700* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:54.280- 02:00.640* :  you can feel the touch of Vincent's hand when he painted it.
*02:00.700- 02:05.840* :  And it's there with full force of his vision.
*02:06.680- 02:10.280* :  Stari Knight over the Roan by the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh
*02:10.280- 02:15.040* :  has returned to the French city of Al where he painted it in 1888.
*02:18.940- 02:21.740* :  We start in Israel where right wing coalition partners
*02:21.740- 02:25.660* :  are threatening to bring down the government if the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*02:25.660- 02:29.960* :  agrees to a plan put forward by President Biden to end the war in Gaza.
*02:30.600- 02:33.500* :  Mr Biden unveiled the three-stage plan on Friday.
*02:34.180- 02:36.380* :  In a post on social media, which we voiced up,
*02:36.400- 02:40.460* :  Mr Netanyahu repeated that there will be no permanent ceasefire
*02:40.820- 02:42.560* :  until Hamas was destroyed.
*02:43.320- 02:46.200* :  Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed.
*02:46.740- 02:49.540* :  The destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities,
*02:49.540- 02:55.440* :  the freeing of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.
*02:56.260- 03:00.580* :  Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met
*03:01.040- 03:03.120* :  before a permanent ceasefire is put in place.
*03:03.920- 03:08.720* :  The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled
*03:09.160- 03:10.080* :  is a non-starter.
*03:11.020- 03:15.340* :  This contrasted with a much more positive response from Hamas's bassam naeem.
*03:15.860- 03:18.320* :  He said it would accept the deal if Israel did.
*03:19.240- 03:24.340* :  It depends on the Israeli reactions and acceptance to this deal,
*03:24.900- 03:29.540* :  if they are ready to go to the deal, Hamas will go for this deal.
*03:29.940- 03:31.620* :  At the end, it is not about Hamas.
*03:31.620- 03:32.860* :  It is not about the resistance.
*03:32.860- 03:37.120* :  It is about Palestinian people who are looking for their freedom and dignity.
*03:37.120- 03:44.220* :  We are attacking the aggression for 75 years, the occupation, the apartheid regime.
*03:44.360- 03:46.220* :  It is our right to fight our dignity.
*03:46.940- 03:50.800* :  We asked Hal Schneider, political and diplomatic correspondent for the times of Israel,
*03:51.380- 03:55.180* :  whether the coalition would collapse if Mr Netanyahu accepted this deal.
*03:56.120- 04:00.940* :  Probably yes, that is a good outcome, however, because this government doesn't have the
*04:01.180- 04:05.440* :  trust of the Israeli people after the mass failure of October 7th.
*04:05.520- 04:09.900* :  So if that will be the case, many people here will not be sad about it.
*04:10.080- 04:12.660* :  The only problem is that Netanyahu doesn't want to go that way.
*04:12.840- 04:19.080* :  Obviously, the two ministers who are opposing this deal are from the very far extreme right wing
*04:19.080- 04:23.540* :  of Israel, and it said that they are now in power.
*04:23.540- 04:31.020* :  But one of them already opposed the previous deal, where 105 women and kids and elderly
*04:31.020- 04:34.620* :  and foreign workers, by the way, ties were released.
*04:34.960- 04:37.020* :  So he opposed that previous deal.
*04:37.640- 04:38.620* :  It is a tough decision.
*04:38.920- 04:41.740* :  The government will not survive when the deal is done,
*04:41.740- 04:47.120* :  and when the goggles achieved, probably it will have to go to election anyhow.
*04:47.120- 04:52.000* :  So it's not a big temptation to Netanyahu to count on that.
*04:52.000- 04:56.360* :  Even so, if he wants to do it, he has the help from the position.
*04:56.360- 05:00.060* :  Not just him, many other people in the opposition will support him
*05:00.640- 05:02.500* :  if he's putting this deal for a vote.
*05:02.560- 05:05.460* :  It doesn't need to put it for a vote at the plenium, by the way.
*05:05.460- 05:07.960* :  He only needs a majority in the government.
*05:08.380- 05:09.740* :  That's the problem with his leadership.
*05:09.740- 05:11.640* :  It doesn't make the call.
*05:11.880- 05:15.220* :  And I think the reason President Biden went out on Friday night
*05:15.220- 05:17.940* :  and just announced what the deal is.
*05:17.940- 05:20.500* :  He just revealed all of the details is exactly because
*05:21.060- 05:24.040* :  it doesn't want Netanyahu to have excuses or a way out.
*05:24.900- 05:29.400* :  Taj Nader, while the US, Egypt and Qatar, as mediators in the negotiations,
*05:29.520- 05:34.500* :  have issued a joint statement calling on Hamas and Israel to accept the proposals.
*05:35.200- 05:37.780* :  But what pressure will the US exert on Israel,
*05:37.780- 05:41.900* :  given that Friday's announcement was President Biden's first major address,
*05:41.900- 05:44.800* :  outlining how the war in Gaza might end?
*05:45.180- 05:47.340* :  Our Washington correspondent is Will Vernon.
*05:48.300- 05:52.480* :  Well, I think we saw that pressure come to fruition, didn't we?
*05:52.840- 05:57.720* :  Last month, when President Biden in an interview with CNN announced that he had paused
*05:57.720- 06:02.560* :  one shipment of heavy weapons destined for Israel, the kind of weapons he said
*06:02.560- 06:05.300* :  that could be used in major population centers,
*06:05.300- 06:09.900* :  such as Raffa and other shipments, he said, were under review.
*06:09.900- 06:11.560* :  And that was a major announcement.
*06:12.160- 06:14.400* :  This was the first time in a long time,
*06:14.400- 06:20.920* :  perhaps 30 years that the US had withheld weapons shipments to Israel for this reason.
*06:20.920- 06:25.400* :  But I think what you've got here is a really tricky situation for President Biden.
*06:25.400- 06:29.720* :  He made that very optimistic White House address on Friday in which he said
*06:29.720- 06:33.220* :  it's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin.
*06:33.660- 06:38.820* :  Pretty grand words, setting out this comprehensive proposal for a three-stage peace plan.
*06:38.820- 06:44.080* :  And I think Mr. Biden is desperately hoping that Israel and Hamas will agree to it,
*06:44.080- 06:47.740* :  and he tried, didn't he, in that speech, to draw a line under the conflict.
*06:47.740- 06:51.620* :  But as you say, we've had the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:51.760- 06:53.320* :  in these comments he made on Saturday,
*06:53.320- 06:57.600* :  taking perhaps some of the shine off of that Biden announcement
*06:57.600- 07:01.380* :  by reiterating Israel's position that the war will not end
*07:01.720- 07:03.520* :  without the complete destruction of Hamas.
*07:03.520- 07:08.700* :  All its military and governing capabilities as Mr. Netanyahu put it.
*07:09.040- 07:12.420* :  And it's not the first time Mr. Biden has talked optimistically
*07:12.420- 07:14.800* :  about there being an end to the conflict soon,
*07:15.340- 07:17.460* :  only for those hopes to be dashed.
*07:18.060- 07:20.400* :  That's right, and optimistic he has to be,
*07:20.400- 07:25.620* :  because he is under a huge amount of pressure here at home,
*07:25.900- 07:28.400* :  not only from the Republicans in Congress
*07:28.400- 07:33.880* :  who are accusing Mr. Biden of basically abandoning a key U.S. ally in the Middle East.
*07:33.880- 07:37.820* :  But also from Democrats, progressives, people in his own party,
*07:38.180- 07:42.800* :  who are very unhappy indeed with the Biden administration's support for Israel.
*07:42.860- 07:47.920* :  Because despite all these differences of opinion over how Israel is conducting the war,
*07:47.920- 07:51.300* :  America remains Israel's most important ally.
*07:51.300- 07:53.960* :  It's largest supplier of military equipment.
*07:53.960- 07:56.840* :  America still guarantees Israel's security.
*07:56.840- 08:01.600* :  Ironclad is the word that Mr. Biden and other U.S. officials have used many times
*08:01.600- 08:03.660* :  to describe that guarantee.
*08:04.100- 08:09.740* :  Just a few days ago, several U.S. media reported that American-supplied weapons were involved
*08:10.180- 08:11.360* :  in an attack in Raffer.
*08:11.800- 08:13.960* :  That strike and the resulting fire, of course,
*08:13.960- 08:16.280* :  claimed the lies of dozens of Palestinian civilians
*08:16.280- 08:20.800* :  and that only amplified the criticism of Mr. Biden's support for Israel.
*08:20.800- 08:24.440* :  So he really is under a huge amount of pressure from all sides,
*08:24.440- 08:27.440* :  and in a crucial election year here.
*08:27.880- 08:31.120* :  So, of course, the White House will now be desperately hoping that both sides
*08:31.120- 08:32.540* :  can finally agree to this deal.
*08:33.440- 08:33.960* :  Will Vernon.
*08:34.580- 08:39.820* :  The American Aerospace Giant Boeing has failed in its latest attempt to fly its first crew
*08:39.820- 08:41.500* :  to the International Space Station.
*08:41.960- 08:46.360* :  The launch of its Starliner spaceship with two veteran astronauts on board
*08:46.720- 08:51.580* :  was halted in the final minutes of countdown from Cape Canaveral in Florida.
*08:52.200- 08:54.940* :  Boeing's computer systems flagged up a problem.
*08:55.420- 08:56.820* :  The call was being investigated.
*08:57.600- 08:59.280* :  A few minutes after the launch was halted,
*08:59.340- 09:02.400* :  this is how a NASA commentator explained the situation.
*09:03.320- 09:07.020* :  The mission, the NASA's Boeing's crew flight test
*09:07.400- 09:12.580* :  of the Boeing Starliner was scrubbed at 12.21 pm eastern time
*09:13.040- 09:19.020* :  when a hold was issued by the ground launch sequencer for the Atlas V rocket.
*09:19.560- 09:22.180* :  It was at two minus three minutes and fifty seconds.
*09:22.180- 09:25.140* :  It was just a little less than four minutes before lift off
*09:25.200- 09:27.440* :  when that abort was called.
*09:27.440- 09:31.520* :  The crew of Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams
*09:31.520- 09:34.700* :  who are inside the capsule at the top of this rocket,
*09:35.480- 09:38.520* :  they are awaiting the arrival of the blue team
*09:38.820- 09:42.520* :  to come out to the launch pad and help them egress,
*09:42.620- 09:47.080* :  which essentially means get out of the Starliner capsule
*09:47.500- 09:49.080* :  and head back to crew quarters.
*09:50.200- 09:53.120* :  There may be another attempt to launch the rocket on Sunday.
*09:53.660- 09:55.520* :  A successful launch would have made Boeing
*09:55.520- 09:59.360* :  the second commercial operator to ferry cruise to the ISS
*10:00.120- 10:01.620* :  after Elon Musk's SpaceX.
*10:02.260- 10:05.960* :  Boeing's previous attempt was aborted hours before lift off.
*10:06.400- 10:07.880* :  We got more on the background of the delay
*10:07.880- 10:10.060* :  from our science correspondent, Palab Gosh.
*10:11.040- 10:12.400* :  We came so close.
*10:13.060- 10:15.240* :  All the flight controllers, one after another, said,
*10:15.500- 10:19.200* :  go, go, go, the computer said no.
*10:20.060- 10:23.480* :  That was just less than four minutes before the launch.
*10:23.900- 10:27.400* :  The ground launch system, as it's called, is a piece of software.
*10:27.820- 10:28.660* :  It didn't load.
*10:29.200- 10:31.900* :  NASA and Boeing don't know why that is.
*10:32.240- 10:34.980* :  It could either be that it spotted something
*10:34.980- 10:37.420* :  that the flight controllers didn't and there might be a problem
*10:37.420- 10:40.500* :  with one of the components on the system
*10:40.980- 10:42.360* :  or it could just be a software fault.
*10:42.360- 10:45.500* :  If it's a latter, then that could be quickly fixed
*10:46.020- 10:47.300* :  and they might have another go.
*10:47.940- 10:50.660* :  But if it's one of the systems, it could take a lot longer.
*10:51.080- 10:52.620* :  Who else has part of this program?
*10:53.480- 10:56.320* :  So the main party is Boeing.
*10:57.040- 11:01.020* :  They're the company that has taken on SpaceX,
*11:01.020- 11:04.240* :  Elon Musk's SpaceX, to provide competition
*11:05.020- 11:08.440* :  for the contract to send supplies and crews and astronauts
*11:08.440- 11:10.080* :  to the International Space Station.
*11:10.480- 11:12.560* :  There's also the United Launch Alliance,
*11:13.080- 11:14.840* :  who are the people that have got the rocket.
*11:14.840- 11:17.120* :  The spacecraft is the bit on top.
*11:17.520- 11:18.900* :  And of course, there is NASA.
*11:19.400- 11:22.980* :  So between the three of them, they wanted to get this first crew's
*11:23.000- 11:24.660* :  test flight off the ground.
*11:25.020- 11:27.980* :  Unfortunately, it's been delayed and delayed
*11:27.980- 11:30.140* :  because of various technical issues.
*11:30.820- 11:34.200* :  And this is just the latest part of this long story.
*11:34.540- 11:38.680* :  But I think what Boeing would say is that after all these delays
*11:39.320- 11:40.320* :  having come so close,
*11:40.800- 11:43.380* :  it's probably worth waiting an extra day or so,
*11:43.840- 11:45.720* :  particularly as there were astronauts on board.
*11:45.740- 11:46.640* :  Better safe than sorry.
*11:46.880- 11:49.400* :  Okay, and very quickly, there have been other parties
*11:49.400- 11:51.500* :  who have managed crewed missions.
*11:52.120- 11:54.400* :  Well, that's right, notably Elon Musk's SpaceX.
*11:55.000- 11:58.140* :  Boeing and SpaceX were offered the contract at the same time
*11:58.140- 12:01.060* :  to develop a system to go to the International Space Station.
*12:01.360- 12:04.380* :  Elon Musk's SpaceX got there in 2020.
*12:05.160- 12:06.760* :  So they're still behind,
*12:07.400- 12:09.860* :  but Boeing can hope that it'll fix the problem
*12:09.860- 12:11.880* :  and catch up as soon as it can.
*12:12.560- 12:14.720* :  Palab goes speaking to LaQuesta Burak.
*12:15.200- 12:18.240* :  Next to South Africa, where political parties are gearing up
*12:18.240- 12:21.260* :  for coalition talks after the African National Congress,
*12:21.260- 12:23.480* :  the party once led by Nelson Mandela,
*12:23.860- 12:26.940* :  suffered its worst election results since the end of apartheid.
*12:27.240- 12:30.920* :  The ANC won around 40% of the votes in Wednesday's election,
*12:31.260- 12:33.040* :  a sharp drop from the last one,
*12:33.560- 12:36.500* :  meaning it will have to share power for the first time
*12:36.500- 12:38.040* :  in order to continue governing.
*12:38.540- 12:41.760* :  Our Africa correspondent Barbara Pletasha reports from Johannesburg.
*12:46.220- 12:48.200* :  There was a late-night flurry of activity here
*12:48.200- 12:50.500* :  when the former president Jacob Zuma paid a visit.
*12:50.920- 12:52.880* :  He was mobbed by supporters and journalists.
*12:53.660- 12:56.220* :  Mr. Zuma is the head of the upstart MK party.
*12:56.220- 12:59.060* :  It came in third, but has claimed there's evidence
*12:59.060- 13:02.180* :  of election rigging and said it might challenge the results in court.
*13:03.080- 13:05.660* :  Already, it has taken a lot of votes from the ANC,
*13:05.660- 13:08.080* :  which is also reeling from voter anger
*13:08.340- 13:10.960* :  over economic mismanagement and corruption scandals.
*13:11.600- 13:14.840* :  This is the most dramatic political shift since the end of apartheid.
*13:15.140- 13:16.780* :  The chair of the Electoral Commission,
*13:16.780- 13:20.260* :  Mosutu Moaipia, said it needs to be managed well.
*13:20.860- 13:26.040* :  We ask for all electoral stakeholders to please remain calm.
*13:27.500- 13:32.180* :  Thalidas to lead this nation at this time,
*13:33.560- 13:37.420* :  and for voices of rhythm to continue to prevail.
*13:39.100- 13:46.040* :  This is a moment that we need to manage and manage well.
*13:46.660- 13:48.500* :  The ANC is still the biggest party,
*13:48.500- 13:53.120* :  but it's lost its majority and is preparing to begin complex coalition talks.
*13:53.120- 13:55.100* :  There are no easy fits.
*13:55.100- 13:58.880* :  The leader of the left-wing economic freedom fighters, Julius Malema,
*13:59.300- 14:00.960* :  said he wanted to work with the ANC,
*14:00.960- 14:03.120* :  but he sounded like a fighter.
*14:03.640- 14:07.840* :  We are happy because we have achieved our mission in our lifetime,
*14:08.740- 14:11.620* :  and that mission was to bring the ANC below 50 percent.
*14:12.160- 14:13.780* :  That's what we have always told you,
*14:14.260- 14:18.560* :  that this animal is going to be eaten piece by piece.
*14:18.880- 14:21.760* :  South Africans face weeks of turbulent coalition talks.
*14:22.260- 14:25.340* :  They voted for change, but don't know yet what it will be.
*14:26.260- 14:27.040* :  Barbara Pletasha.
*14:28.060- 14:30.860* :  It's taken six weeks, involved nearly a billion people,
*14:30.860- 14:36.520* :  but now India's mammoth elections have finally ended with a seventh and final round being held,
*14:36.520- 14:39.160* :  as much as the country is battling a heat wave,
*14:39.600- 14:44.040* :  with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius in many places.
*14:44.620- 14:47.820* :  The votes are now being counted, and the results are expected on Tuesday.
*14:48.320- 14:52.120* :  Exit polls project the Prime Minister Narendra Modi will win a third term,
*14:52.480- 14:57.300* :  but our South Asia correspondent Samar Hussein in Delhi told us they should be taken with a pinch
*14:57.300- 15:04.500* :  assault. These exit polls are not always the most reliable. However, what's interesting is
*15:04.600- 15:09.280* :  when you're looking across the board, we're seeing that a lot of these exit polls are saying that
*15:09.280- 15:16.580* :  they're expecting a BJP-led coalition government, and not an outright win for the Parthiajanta
*15:16.580- 15:21.060* :  Party, the ruling party in India. So we're waiting for the results to come in.
*15:21.060- 15:26.940* :  It will still take a few more days. One factor, which is probably affected turnout,
*15:26.940- 15:31.540* :  which seems to have affected turnout, is the heat wave that India is currently experiencing.
*15:31.860- 15:38.460* :  Right, so if you look at the last few phases of the election, we saw that voter turnout was
*15:38.520- 15:44.720* :  in the low 60s, and if you look at other election phases, we saw a much higher turnout,
*15:45.300- 15:50.260* :  and there are many people that are actually attributing that to the extreme heat. I mean,
*15:50.260- 15:55.200* :  in the last two weeks, parts of northern India were under extreme heat,
*15:55.200- 16:01.140* :  advisories, the temperatures hitting over 50 degrees Celsius in some locations. So you even had
*16:01.500- 16:05.700* :  election officials that were taking great precautions, offering cold drinks,
*16:05.740- 16:12.200* :  water, and misting fans at polling booths to try and encourage more people to come out and vote,
*16:12.200- 16:17.480* :  but also to alleviate some of the pressure that exists for those that were standing in line as
*16:17.480- 16:22.700* :  there was so much heat. Samira Hussein, stars twinkling in the night sky,
*16:22.700- 16:27.240* :  a couple strolling by the river, and gas lamps reflected in the water.
*16:27.840- 16:32.400* :  Starry Night, over the road, no work by the Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh, has returned to the
*16:32.400- 16:39.060* :  French city of Al for the first time since he painted it in 1888. The painting, on loan from
*16:39.060- 16:44.360* :  the Muse d'Orsay in Paris, has been displayed in paravance as part of an exhibition Van Gogh and
*16:44.360- 16:50.120* :  the stars. Lele Natu spoke to B.J. Courager, the exhibition's co-curator.
*16:51.040- 16:59.520* :  This is really a great moment for the people in the city, and yes, for me, for all the people who
*16:59.520- 17:07.960* :  worked here for 10 years. It's also our anniversary, so it's a great day. Do you think it changes
*17:08.340- 17:13.920* :  somebody's viewing experience, someone's experience of this painting to see it so close to
*17:13.920- 17:19.340* :  its actual location, and then being able to actually go there for themselves, perhaps, to the scene
*17:19.340- 17:27.000* :  that is depicted? Yes, it's really magic to be in the spot, a couple of hundred meters away,
*17:28.120- 17:35.980* :  and see the original of an image that has been so over-reproduced and reproduced,
*17:36.540- 17:45.660* :  and globally distributed, and suddenly you see the original, and you can feel the touch of
*17:46.440- 17:57.080* :  Vincent's hand when he painted it, and it's there with a full force of his vision he had about
*17:58.000- 18:06.460* :  telling us something, what it is, looking at the night up in the sky and having a moment of
*18:06.460- 18:16.140* :  greater feeling about our life and our being on Earth, looking up in the universe.
*18:16.220- 18:22.300* :  How does it compare now the view that he, where he sat and painted that painting? What's different now?
*18:22.700- 18:31.300* :  It's actually, Arle hasn't changed so much when you stand at the same spot where he was standing
*18:31.300- 18:43.920* :  in a night in 1888, still the same shoreline, and you can imagine, and that consolation of the stars
*18:43.920- 18:53.900* :  can come back exactly in the same way, because there is an astronomical justice, which he really
*18:53.900- 19:04.420* :  depicted, but at the same time you can think back in the 19th century how it was when suddenly
*19:04.540- 19:13.480* :  the night was illuminated with gas lights, because that had just happened seven years before he painted
*19:13.480- 19:22.520* :  the painting that these lamps were installed, and he was not against the modernity, didn't come
*19:23.040- 19:32.280* :  down to the south in this small city after having lived in London and in Paris, and he knew exactly
*19:32.300- 19:39.820* :  what modern cities, what the transformation of the world in the 19th century meant.
*19:44.820- 19:50.240* :  Still to come in this podcast? Until 50 years ago, if someone was choking, all that was likely to
*19:50.240- 19:56.240* :  happen was that they would be slapped on the back. But we'll tell you how that all changed thanks to one
*19:56.240- 19:57.900* :  man, Henry Heimlich.
*20:06.060- 20:11.640* :  One size fits all seemed like a good idea for clothes. Nice dress. It's a t-shirt.

*21:11.140- 21:16.400* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast. The owner of Ticketmaster LiveNation has confirmed
*21:16.400- 21:21.400* :  that hackers have accessed customer data. This comes days after the hacking group,
*21:21.400- 21:25.980* :  shiny hunters, claimed to have stolen the personal details of more than half a billion
*21:25.980- 21:31.840* :  Ticketmaster customers. Our business reporter Simon Browning told us what was known about the hack.
*21:32.780- 21:38.720* :  Half a billion customers, you just said it. This is a massive attack. It's a significant attack.
*21:39.100- 21:44.440* :  Ticketmaster is known around the world, if you like music, concerts, theatre, festivals,
*21:44.440- 21:49.440* :  showbiz, pop stars, the rest of it, you're likely to have bought tickets through Ticketmaster.
*21:49.860- 21:53.140* :  And lots of us will have signed up and given it, it's our personal information,
*21:53.960- 21:57.940* :  addresses, credit card details, etc. Now the first rumors about this came out on Thursday
*21:57.940- 22:01.300* :  when the hackers said they'd done it. But there was no confirmation at that stage.
*22:01.300- 22:05.040* :  But this morning in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States,
*22:05.040- 22:10.960* :  LiveNation, the owners of Ticketmaster confirmed it had been targeted in a cyber attack.
*22:11.620- 22:15.180* :  Now, Ticketmaster and LiveNation haven't confirmed that half a billion
*22:15.180- 22:20.320* :  figure that we've been given by the hackers. They're called shiny hunters, and they claim that they
*22:20.320- 22:27.800* :  have got names, addresses, phone numbers, partial credit cards that demanding $500,000 of ransom
*22:28.780- 22:33.920* :  from LiveNation Ticketmaster's owners to prevent our data then being sold on the black market,
*22:33.920- 22:38.920* :  which is where the risk comes to all of us, people who are customers, and what they have
*22:39.120- 22:43.360* :  stored with them. So we haven't got the full details yet from Ticketmaster, but how
*22:43.360- 22:48.620* :  damaging is this for them? It's a very difficult situation. We've been talking to security experts
*22:48.620- 22:52.800* :  and cyber security experts all day today. They are saying this could be one of the biggest
*22:52.800- 22:59.820* :  cyber security hacks in history. There are a huge amount of tickets, ticket holders, personal
*22:59.820- 23:04.320* :  information. There are tours going on around the world. I've been looking all day today. Taylor
*23:04.320- 23:10.660* :  Swift, one of the biggest artists in the world. Many of her concert tickets are sold within Ticketmaster
*23:10.660- 23:15.300* :  and parents are worried about, because their kids are asking, and my ticket's going to be safe.
*23:15.380- 23:18.900* :  I mean, this is a big deal for Ticketmaster. They have responded in a statement today,
*23:18.900- 23:23.900* :  saying that they are doing all they can to mitigate any risk, and they will be contacting
*23:24.560- 23:28.520* :  anybody who they believe has had unauthorized access to personal information,
*23:28.520- 23:32.060* :  but they say this is a criminal threat, and the companies doing all it can.
*23:32.300- 23:37.320* :  And huge hacks like this seem to be more and more frequent. What can we do to protect ourselves?
*23:37.320- 23:42.420* :  Protection is critical, isn't it? And we hear from cyber security experts all the time,
*23:42.420- 23:47.100* :  passwords, passwords all the time, not repeating passwords, not using the same phrases,
*23:47.720- 23:52.580* :  developing key phrases. Today I've been speaking to Lisa Forte. She is a cyber security expert,
*23:53.080- 23:57.340* :  and she gave us some tips on what to do if you start to receive some phishing emails.
*23:58.040- 24:03.700* :  Gammers, fraudsters are likely to be sending emails, sending text messages, pretending to be
*24:03.700- 24:08.620* :  involved in some way, maybe pretending even to be Ticketmaster. So you've got to be very careful,
*24:08.620- 24:14.020* :  if you receive an email or a text message, do not click on any link, do not enter any details
*24:14.620- 24:19.780* :  into anything. Lisa mentions they're not clicking. Opportunistic scammers will be taking every
*24:19.780- 24:23.520* :  opportunity now. It's global news that Ticketmaster has been hacked, and they will be taking
*24:23.520- 24:30.140* :  every chance to expose that risk to people. So be very careful and think about what you do in
*24:30.140- 24:36.440* :  relation to any contact you get about this. Simon Browning, a simple saliva test is proving
*24:36.440- 24:42.140* :  more effective at identifying men at high risk of prostate cancer than standard blood tests
*24:42.140- 24:47.100* :  according to early data. Cancer research bodies in Britain have said it promises to turn
*24:47.100- 24:53.640* :  the tide on the early diagnosis and treatment of a cancer that kills nearly 400,000 men a year
*24:53.640- 24:59.820* :  worldwide. Professor Caroline Moore is a consultant urologist specialising in the detection and
*24:59.820- 25:06.820* :  minimally invasive treatment of prostate cancer. James Menendez asked her how does this new test work?
*25:07.860- 25:14.560* :  They get sent a saliva tube. They put their sample into that and post it off. The saliva is
*25:14.560- 25:22.860* :  analysed for the DNA looking for markers of genetic risk for prostate cancer. So it will then give
*25:22.860- 25:28.480* :  a risk profile higher than average or lower than average at risk of prostate cancer.
*25:29.280- 25:35.880* :  How accurate is it? It's not a diagnostic test for prostate cancer, but it shows that you might
*25:35.880- 25:41.000* :  have a higher chance of having prostate cancer and therefore having some of the other tests,
*25:41.000- 25:47.520* :  the prostate specific antigen blood test, or perhaps an MRI scan, might be particularly useful for
*25:47.520- 25:53.600* :  you. But does it look like it's better at predicting cases of prostate cancer than the blood test?
*25:53.880- 26:00.440* :  It does, yeah. So for the people who had the saliva test and then went on to have prostate
*26:00.440- 26:07.380* :  cancer, nearly 80% of them had a normal blood test. So if all we'd had was the blood test,
*26:07.420- 26:12.160* :  they'd have been reassured. What is the problem with the blood test? Because it picks up false
*26:12.160- 26:18.360* :  positives, doesn't it? Why is that? So it's called prostate specific antigen and it's specific to
*26:18.360- 26:26.440* :  the prostate gland, but not to prostate cancer. So you can have a high level of the PSA blood test
*26:26.560- 26:33.460* :  if you've got a big prostate or if you've got say a urine infection and you can also have a low
*26:33.460- 26:38.540* :  level and still have a prostate cancer. And obviously that then wastes, I mean, it's not good for
*26:38.540- 26:44.220* :  the patient, is it? But it also wastes time and resources for doctors. That's exactly right. So
*26:44.220- 26:49.940* :  that's why we don't have a formal screening programme for prostate cancer. Although it's the
*26:50.360- 26:55.260* :  communist cancer in men in the UK and it's the second communist cause of cancer death,
*26:55.260- 27:00.800* :  there isn't a screening programme like there is for other cancers because so far the tests
*27:00.800- 27:09.120* :  haven't been good enough. So the saliva test will pick up more cases and fewer false positives.
*27:09.360- 27:16.860* :  That's the hope and the next step for it is to assess it in a trial called transform where we're
*27:16.860- 27:23.640* :  doing a large screening study but we're also using the PSA blood test and different forms of MRI
*27:23.740- 27:30.260* :  and then we'll be able to see what's the most effective test or probably combination of tests
*27:30.420- 27:37.640* :  to find the important cancers early. Professor Caroline Moore. Now it's 50 years since the invention
*27:37.640- 27:43.620* :  of a life saving technique that has saved thousands of people from choking to death. The
*27:43.620- 27:48.720* :  Heimlich maneuver was devised by an American surgeon called Henry Heimlich as Terry Egan explains.
*27:49.920- 27:54.980* :  Until 50 years ago on Saturday if someone was choking all that was likely to happen
*27:54.980- 28:00.260* :  was that they would be slapped on the back. That though is something that might even make things
*28:00.260- 28:06.440* :  worse. Henry Heimlich had a better idea. Realising it was the airway that was getting blocked,
*28:06.440- 28:10.820* :  he thought you could use the lungs themselves to solve the problem.
*28:11.140- 28:16.640* :  Trying this out on dogs, none of which were harmed by the trials, he discovered the best method
*28:16.640- 28:23.400* :  was to compress the diaphragm, usually from behind. That squeezes the lungs and increases the air
*28:23.400- 28:29.380* :  pressure within the windpipe and voicewalks. It's aggressive but certainly dislodges whatever's
*28:29.380- 28:35.120* :  blocking the airway. Because the problem occurred most in cafes and restaurants, Heimlich
*28:35.120- 28:41.720* :  wrote an essay entitled Pop Goes the Cafe Coronary explaining the procedure and the technique
*28:41.720- 28:49.240* :  took off. It saved its first life soon afterwards and went on to prevent many others among them the
*28:49.240- 28:57.480* :  former president Ronald Reagan and the singer Scher from dying by choking. Terry Egan, it may have
*28:57.480- 29:03.420* :  felt like deja vu for football fans. Once again the Spanish football giants Real Madrid are champions
*29:03.420- 29:09.840* :  of Europe for a record 15th time. In the Champions League final they beat the German side
*29:09.840- 29:15.740* :  Borussia Dortmund 2-0. But Dortmund certainly put up a fight as we heard from our sports reporter
*29:15.740- 29:21.260* :  George Addo who was watching the game. I thought they came very very close to winning this
*29:21.260- 29:26.960* :  Champions League final. In the first 45 minutes they totally dominated Real Madrid, the 14 time
*29:26.960- 29:33.180* :  Champions. We had an interesting start at the end of the 45 minutes. Real Madrid had not forced
*29:33.180- 29:38.560* :  the save out of the Dortmund goalkeeper. They had two great opportunities to score but were not
*29:38.560- 29:42.900* :  able to put the ball of the back of the net. So clearly in the first 45 minutes they were the
*29:42.940- 29:48.580* :  side that showed that they were able to match Real Madrid despite the quality they had on paper.
*29:49.000- 29:54.920* :  However in the second half like Real Madrid have done all season and have done over the period
*29:54.920- 30:01.940* :  in the Champions League. They came back able to put up a better performance and they most
*30:01.940- 30:06.200* :  importantly just took the opportunities when they had it. Daniel Caval with a fantastic goal
*30:06.200- 30:11.080* :  there from a corner and Vinicius Jr. finishing it of winning it by two goals to nail. In the end
*30:11.120- 30:15.960* :  even from the analysis from the second half it could have been three goals to nail which would not
*30:15.960- 30:21.680* :  have been a very great reflection of the kind of result we had because of how close Dortmund played
*30:21.680- 30:25.740* :  and how close they were to winning it. But it's Real Madrid and this why they won the Champions
*30:25.740- 30:31.300* :  League 15 times. So Dortmund came close but it wasn't close enough. And how do you think Real
*30:31.300- 30:36.640* :  Madrid were able to do this because it did appear at the beginning as you say as if Dortmund could
*30:36.640- 30:44.360* :  win this game? Yeah in the first half in the first half they allowed Dortmund to really go lose
*30:44.360- 30:50.120* :  especially when they had them on the counter attack and so they needed a bit of tightening up
*30:50.120- 30:55.240* :  in the midfield which they did. And it's normally a mental thing because Carlo and Shalotti the
*30:55.240- 31:00.680* :  Real Madrid boss has said time and time and again that he does not approach a game with a specific
*31:00.680- 31:06.220* :  tactic. He just keeps on you know tweaking until everything works out there. I think in this game
*31:06.220- 31:10.560* :  was mentally I'm sure that the talk in the dressing room was important for them because they came
*31:10.560- 31:15.000* :  out the second half and they began to play. They began to show that the goal scoring threat that
*31:15.000- 31:21.600* :  they've had all season. And then we saw them massing up there in the midfield and beginning to
*31:21.600- 31:25.700* :  take on Dortmund like they were not doing in the first half and I feel that that's exactly what
*31:25.700- 31:30.980* :  made the difference for them. That cut in edge that has separated them oftentimes just came back
*31:31.040- 31:35.300* :  in there and were able to get those important goals. After the first goal it was very
*31:35.300- 31:39.160* :  very difficult for Dortmund to come back. They scored a goal to progress but that goal was
*31:39.160- 31:44.200* :  disallowed and in the end there was just no way. Once again the mental side of Real Madrid showing
*31:44.200- 31:47.080* :  and just giving us the indication of how great they've been.
*31:48.100- 31:51.120* :  George Addo now from sport to showbiz.
*31:56.440- 32:01.380* :  The singer Jennifer Lopez known for hits like this has cancelled her US tour which was supposed
*32:01.380- 32:06.680* :  to come off the back of her first album in five years. She told fans she was taking time off to
*32:06.680- 32:12.580* :  be with her children, family and close friends. This comes as rumors are swirling that her marriage
*32:12.580- 32:18.740* :  to the Hollywood actor Ben Affleck may be in trouble but there are also reports that ticket sales
*32:18.740- 32:25.420* :  have been poor. The couple known as Benefit first started dating in 2002 but broke up, married
*32:25.420- 32:31.460* :  other people before then getting back together. Our entertainment reporter Guy Lambert told us more.
*32:32.280- 32:37.540* :  This tour comes off the back of Jennifer Lopez's ninth studio album titled This Is Me Now.
*32:37.540- 32:43.860* :  It was released 20 years after her hit album This Is Me Then and it's her first album for five years
*32:44.160- 32:49.360* :  as you say. The tour was due to kick off in Orlando on the 26th of June and it's going to be two
*32:49.360- 32:55.080* :  months long covering North America and due to conclude in Houston at the end of August but that's
*32:55.080- 33:00.340* :  all over now. The ticketing company Live Nation announced on Friday that the summer tour was cancelled
*33:00.340- 33:05.100* :  saying the singer is taking time off to be with her children, her family and her close friends.
*33:05.760- 33:10.680* :  Live Nation has assured fans in a statement that they will be automatically getting their money
*33:10.680- 33:16.300* :  back in a refund and JLo has also addressed her fans through her on the JLo news letter
*33:16.760- 33:20.920* :  where she wrote that she was completely heart sick and devastated about letting the fans down
*33:20.920- 33:24.800* :  and she wouldn't have to do this if she didn't feel that it was absolutely necessary.
*33:25.080- 33:29.040* :  Interesting choice of word they're heart sick because there's been all this speculation
*33:29.040- 33:35.640* :  about the state of her marriage to Ben Affleck. The two only got married what two years ago.
*33:35.900- 33:40.220* :  A lot of speculation that's been mounting as to why this tour has been cancelled.
*33:40.220- 33:43.440* :  We mean firstly, away from the marriage there have been reports of poor ticket sales
*33:43.440- 33:49.100* :  from the start leading to cancelled dates on their own. There's been a relatively poor
*33:49.100- 33:53.960* :  reception for this new album and it only peaked at 38 in the billboard top 200 in the US.
*33:54.680- 33:58.560* :  But yes, the statement saying that she wants to take time to be with her children and her family
*33:58.560- 34:03.460* :  does suggest that this is closer to home and speculation does continue about the state
*34:03.460- 34:08.860* :  of Jennifer Lopez's marriage to Ben Affleck. She was asked about this at a junket for her new
*34:08.860- 34:14.000* :  sci-fi movie Atlas last week and naturally it was something she refused to engage with.
*34:14.440- 34:17.980* :  But the couple have been seen out in public together earlier this week they were at
*34:18.360- 34:23.920* :  Ben Affleck's daughter's graduation ceremony. So yes, making public appearances but for now what
*34:23.920- 34:29.560* :  we do know is that currently Jela's priorities are more with her family rather than actually
*34:29.560- 34:37.600* :  touring and promoting this new album. Guy Lambert and that's all from us for now but there will be
