*01:22.940- 01:28.600* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, June 18th. These are our main stories.
*01:29.100- 01:33.120* :  Glad we are put in in Kin Jong Un, sign a strategic partnership agreement
*01:33.600- 01:37.180* :  during the Russian leader's first visit to North Korea in more than two decades.
*01:37.900- 01:41.760* :  So Ramaphosa is sworn in for a second time as president of South Africa.
*01:42.440- 01:46.260* :  The gaming chipmaker NVIDIA becomes the world's most valuable company.
*01:48.600- 01:53.340* :  Also in this podcast, the dangerously shifting patterns of the world's warming weather.
*01:53.520- 01:56.980* :  And when it's in its peak, it smells really bad.
*01:56.980- 02:01.260* :  It's like an animal crawled into the glass house and died in the corner.
*02:01.260- 02:03.120* :  It's a really strong false thing.
*02:03.900- 02:06.320* :  The flower that stinks of rotting meat.
*02:11.180- 02:13.880* :  President Vladimir Putin and the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
*02:13.880- 02:16.260* :  are regarded by much of the world as pariahs.
*02:16.500- 02:18.840* :  But today they were the center of global attention.
*02:19.320- 02:23.360* :  Mr. Putin was in Pyongyang, his first visit there in more than two decades.
*02:23.360- 02:27.360* :  And Mr. Kim pulled out all the stops with a red carpet welcome,
*02:27.360- 02:30.680* :  big hugs, crowds and a grand military parade.
*02:37.900- 02:44.660* :  They then spent two hours in discussions which resulted in the signing of a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty,
*02:44.660- 02:48.300* :  which, according to Russian media, includes a mutual defense clause.
*02:48.300- 02:53.000* :  During the talks, Mr. Kim said he fully supported Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.
*02:57.800- 03:01.220* :  The situation continues to be complex and changing all the time.
*03:02.000- 03:04.380* :  We take this opportunity to confirm once again
*03:04.660- 03:09.220* :  we will continue to strengthen strategic communication with the Russian leadership and Russia,
*03:09.900- 03:12.520* :  even in the complex global geopolitical situation,
*03:13.240- 03:16.840* :  and continue to unconditionally support all of Russia's policies.
*03:17.520- 03:19.340* :  This was President Putin's response.
*03:22.380- 03:27.740* :  We very much appreciate your consistent and prominent support of the Russian policy,
*03:28.500- 03:29.940* :  including in the Ukrainian issue.
*03:30.760- 03:35.820* :  I mean in our struggle against the hegemonic imperialist policy imposed for decades
*03:36.580- 03:41.040* :  by the United States and its satellites in relation to the Russian Federation.
*03:41.780- 03:46.580* :  For more on the agreement they have signed, I spoke to Vitaly Shuchenko from BBC Monitoring.
*03:46.960- 03:52.600* :  The most striking and important detail came from Vladimir Putin,
*03:53.400- 04:01.980* :  who spoke in reasonably vague terms about military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.
*04:02.380- 04:06.700* :  He said that Russia is not ruling out military technical cooperation,
*04:06.740- 04:11.620* :  which in Russian official parlance means defense cooperation.
*04:12.020- 04:17.780* :  And also he said as part of the comprehensive strategic partnership deal that the two countries
*04:18.300- 04:26.120* :  agreed to provide mutual assistance in case of aggression against either North Korea or Russia,
*04:26.540- 04:28.140* :  which again means defense.
*04:28.240- 04:36.980* :  Now this raises all sorts of questions given that North Korea is subject to a host of United Nations
*04:37.600- 04:41.400* :  sanctions that ban weapons trade with North Korea.
*04:41.400- 04:46.300* :  So how exactly is Russia going to implement this defense cooperation?
*04:47.080- 04:51.680* :  That's going to be interesting and also questions will be asked and people will be watching
*04:51.680- 04:57.780* :  keenly whether Russia has secured any further agreements to obtain weapons,
*04:57.780- 05:01.560* :  which is artillery shells and possibly ballistic missiles from North Korea.
*05:02.080- 05:06.600* :  There's nothing about that that was said in the press conference given by the two leaders
*05:06.600- 05:13.420* :  or in Russian or North Korean state TV, possibly because this kind of trade is banned by the US.
*05:13.880- 05:18.740* :  And what do you think that Russia wants out of this? Does it want weapons for the conflict in
*05:18.740- 05:26.240* :  Ukraine? Well there's that and also there are more symbolic reasons for Putin to go to North Korea
*05:26.240- 05:33.800* :  and for Russian state TV to trumpet this visit. The message to audiences in Russia and abroad
*05:33.800- 05:41.700* :  is that Vladimir Putin has friends, he's got countries abroad which he can visit and be welcomed
*05:41.700- 05:50.160* :  and that's why Russian state TV as we speak it's savoring every minute detail of this lavish welcome
*05:50.800- 05:56.100* :  that's been afforded to the Russian president in Pyongyang. The reason is that both North Korea
*05:56.700- 06:02.520* :  and Russia they're one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. The West is
*06:02.520- 06:08.660* :  making efforts to ostracize them but the message sent by Putin is look I'm free to travel I've got
*06:09.700- 06:15.780* :  and how do you think this tire will be viewed in the West? We've already heard that China's keeping
*06:15.780- 06:20.720* :  a very close eye on it. What do you think America and the rest of the world will think?
*06:22.040- 06:30.120* :  Well it's bad news for America and its allies such as Ukraine especially if Russia gets more
*06:30.120- 06:36.500* :  ammunition and weapons from North Korea and Washington has said that it will do all it can to
*06:37.020- 06:44.260* :  put an end to such supplies from North Korea and Iran as well but what exactly it can do is less
*06:44.260- 06:50.960* :  than clear given that there's evidence of North Korean munitions being used in Ukraine.
*06:51.700- 06:55.480* :  Vitaly Shifchenko and now to the South African capital Pretoria.
*07:01.340- 07:06.660* :  The sound there of the long and elaborate ceremony that saw Cyril Ramaphosa sworn in for his
*07:06.660- 07:11.800* :  second term as president. He'll head a coalition after the African National Congress reached a
*07:11.800- 07:17.320* :  deal with its rival the Democratic Alliance following the ANC loss of seats in last month's
*07:17.320- 07:22.400* :  selection. Our correspondent Barbara Pletasha who's in Johannesburg watched the events unfold.
*07:22.980- 07:28.080* :  There have been foreign dignitaries attending there's been a military flyby there's been a
*07:28.560- 07:35.660* :  battalion march past and a 21 gun salute everyone dressed in very sort of colorful clothing
*07:36.620- 07:42.280* :  and also on the lawn in front of the building various groups singing and dancing so it has been
*07:43.160- 07:48.980* :  quite a festive day. And what did Mr Ramaphosa say in his address? What tone did he strike?
*07:49.660- 07:57.200* :  I would say it was both optimistic but also solemn he said that this was a moment of profound
*07:57.200- 08:02.800* :  significance the beginning of a new era and he was referring to of course the government of
*08:02.800- 08:07.240* :  power sharing that the ANC has been forced to agree to because it lost its majority
*08:08.440- 08:13.460* :  but he acknowledged that the reason it lost its majority was because voters were angry with
*08:13.460- 08:19.480* :  ANC for its economic failures and it's the allegations of corruption in essence. He sort of said humbly
*08:19.480- 08:24.000* :  I've heard what you've said and this new coalition is committed to reversing inequalities
*08:24.000- 08:29.140* :  and growing the economy but he also it made some warnings he said the country was polarized
*08:29.840- 08:34.480* :  driven with deep divisions between the haves and the have-nots and that if these were not
*08:34.480- 08:40.100* :  addressed that could turn into instability so he said we have to either choose to move forward
*08:40.100- 08:45.140* :  together or risk losing all we have built so quite a bit of time spent on the need for unity
*08:45.140- 08:51.140* :  and the threats to it also warning South Africans to reject any efforts to so doubt and cynicism
*08:51.140- 08:56.020* :  and undermine our institutions. Well you mentioned the economy that has and have not
*08:56.020- 09:01.380* :  been how bad is it in South Africa now you're there how bad is it? Well there was progress
*09:02.000- 09:05.800* :  under the ANC the African National Congress after the end of apartheid
*09:06.080- 09:10.720* :  its black empowerment programs and social welfare did lift millions of black people out of poverty
*09:11.400- 09:16.280* :  but what you have now is you still have many of those inequalities firmly entrenched in terms
*09:16.280- 09:21.280* :  of where people live and what their opportunities are and you have a very high unemployment rate
*09:21.280- 09:25.900* :  it's the highest in the world at least the recorded highest and especially for young people
*09:25.900- 09:31.240* :  you have services that aren't working water electricity that aren't reliable you have
*09:31.240- 09:37.640* :  infrastructure that's not working and a lot of that is blamed on corruption in high ranks or
*09:38.080- 09:41.820* :  appointing people who weren't competent to the job so there are a lot of things that South
*09:41.820- 09:47.040* :  Africans are angry about and many I think do want to see this coalition although it is unusual
*09:47.040- 09:51.840* :  to have these two rivals working together to at least try to get the economy back on track.
*09:52.280- 09:57.620* :  Barbara Pletasha so what lies ahead well Tessa Dooms is director of the South African
*09:57.620- 10:03.580* :  think tank Ravonia Circle she says President Ramaphosa now faces a big challenge in crafting
*10:03.580- 10:09.120* :  and maintaining a coalition government. So actually I'm going to be very interesting to see if
*10:09.120- 10:15.020* :  President Ramaphosa has the leadership ability to bring together people from outside his party when
*10:15.020- 10:20.380* :  he's struggled to do so from within. People in the ANC have argued that so Ramaphosa has done a
*10:20.380- 10:25.640* :  good job of getting people out who did not agree with him but what that has done is actually
*10:25.640- 10:31.800* :  weakened the ANC in that you've seen the creation of another ANC breakaway the biggest one we've
*10:31.800- 10:38.320* :  seen in the history of democratic South Africa and so dispelling people and alienating people has
*10:38.320- 10:45.280* :  not worked and so his ability to really unify the ANC hasn't worked out that well so when it comes
*10:45.280- 10:50.640* :  to bringing together other parties around the table we're not only outside the ANC but are quite
*10:50.640- 10:55.580* :  different ideologically different in terms of the consequences that they serve while he's
*10:55.580- 11:00.780* :  also dealing with a weakened ANC and two opposition parties in the EFF and in the MK that are
*11:00.780- 11:05.080* :  going to give him a hard time I do think there's going to be a big test of his own leadership
*11:05.080- 11:10.740* :  in the next few years I'm not particularly excited at the prospect that he'll be able to
*11:10.740- 11:16.680* :  curl people together but it is going to be necessary for him to have a very firm grip on his
*11:16.680- 11:22.040* :  cabinet going forward what's going to be the lesson and that needs to be learned is that they're
*11:22.040- 11:28.080* :  going to have to prioritize policy over position and they're going to have to prioritize stability
*11:28.080- 11:34.560* :  over political breakmanship we need a lot of maturity here that is policy based once we get to
*11:34.560- 11:39.700* :  the point that a cabinet is established we're going to figure out to what extent it's it's going to
*11:39.700- 11:44.660* :  be contested at the level of positions and whether those are going to be the deal breakers or
*11:44.660- 11:49.160* :  where the policy is going to win over at the end of the day. Tessa Dooms of the Rivenia Circle
*11:49.160- 11:55.880* :  Think Tank the stock market has a new teching NVIDIA leapfrogging two household names
*11:55.880- 12:02.720* :  Microsoft and Apple NVIDIA now controls more than 80% of the market for the chips used in AI
*12:02.720- 12:08.660* :  systems. It rises among the fastest in market history just two years ago the company's market
*12:08.660- 12:14.700* :  valuation was over four hundred million dollars now in just 12 months it's gone from one trillion
*12:14.700- 12:20.800* :  dollars to wait for it more than three trillion. Stephen Whitt writes for the New Yorker and is
*12:20.800- 12:26.660* :  the author of a new book on NVIDIA and he's been explaining the firm's gidding rise to M upon it.
*12:27.400- 12:32.140* :  Well we've seen the success of systems like chat GPT and all these new fantastic tools that are
*12:32.140- 12:37.780* :  being built but where do they come from? They have to train they have to train on AI hardware and
*12:37.780- 12:42.800* :  they have to be deployed on AI hardware and the amount of computing power that they require is
*12:42.800- 12:48.840* :  absolutely massive. Larger really than any other system that's ever been deployed. NVIDIA supplies
*12:48.840- 12:54.240* :  that hardware. They're the sole supplier in many cases. You can compare it to the gold rush
*12:54.480- 12:59.280* :  they're the guys who are selling the shovels. It's an interesting comparison. It's also for people
*12:59.280- 13:03.900* :  trying to imagine where those systems are coming from they perhaps haven't thought about it but
*13:03.900- 13:08.620* :  they now will be starting to hear this name and also perhaps the name of the CEO as well who I
*13:08.620- 13:13.160* :  understand has become a bit of a rock star to some. Jensen Wong has had one of the most successful
*13:13.160- 13:19.160* :  runs in business history. Actually for years he was a vendor of gaming hardware. NVIDIA was
*13:19.600- 13:26.100* :  classically a supplier of kind of graphics hardware for games like World of Warcraft or Call of Duty
*13:26.680- 13:31.180* :  but what they found was that running these games is one of the hardest things a computer could do.
*13:31.740- 13:37.900* :  Jensen intuited that these circuits could be repurposed for scientific uses and found that when AI
*13:37.900- 13:44.920* :  when AI came along it was the perfect match. About 10 or 11 years ago he bet his entire company
*13:45.300- 13:49.780* :  on this concept. Pushed in all the chips was a long shot bet but now it paid off.
*13:50.460- 13:55.980* :  In terms of you know some talking that as often as can be at the moment with these sorts of
*13:55.980- 14:00.380* :  companies about a bubble but this isn't a bubble in the sense of it's a profit making business
*14:00.380- 14:06.360* :  isn't it? It makes an extraordinary amount of profit. It makes a fantastic product that people love
*14:06.840- 14:12.180* :  it's a revenues and profitability are absolutely through the roof that's driving the stock higher.
*14:12.420- 14:18.520* :  Now I will say in the past month or so it's gotten a little frothy and a lot of people are contacting
*14:18.520- 14:23.500* :  me saying you know I've never traded the stock before. I don't know what they do but I just bought
*14:23.500- 14:29.120* :  some shares because it went up so much. So there's a little bit of mania going on there but you know
*14:29.120- 14:35.300* :  Jensen describes what he's building as an AI factory where data goes in and intelligence comes out
*14:35.900- 14:41.380* :  and if that's true it could have an absolutely revolutionary impact on the economy and could
*14:41.380- 14:47.240* :  transform productivity for decades to come. Yes although that's a whole other discussion I suppose
*14:47.240- 14:52.500* :  about where that leaves us and our workforce but in terms of those household names the Microsoft's
*14:52.500- 14:59.200* :  the apples are they looking at upping their their competition in this area trying to to catch up
*14:59.260- 15:03.540* :  can it catch up? Microsoft is not a competitor of Nvidia's in fact they're one of their largest
*15:03.540- 15:08.380* :  customers that's true with Apple too. The reason that Nvidia is doing so well is they functionally
*15:08.380- 15:14.040* :  have almost no competition at all. They build these AI microchips and they really kind of wandered
*15:14.040- 15:18.160* :  off into a field by themselves a long time ago and just started building them before there were
*15:18.160- 15:24.360* :  really any customers around to buy them. When the customers finally showed up it was a banza for them
*15:24.740- 15:29.120* :  but it meant that they have practically you know no competitors. Actually Microsoft's stock and
*15:29.120- 15:33.800* :  Apple stock both are up in sympathy with Nvidia. Nvidia has helped those companies to grow.
*15:37.340- 15:46.340* :  Still to come. We've never lived next to rubbish. I cry just like any other grandmother would
*15:46.340- 15:58.280* :  over her grandchildren being sick. As the conflict in Gaza continues the threat to civilians posed
*15:58.280- 16:12.360* :  by huge piles of stinking uncollected rubbish. When you're ready to pop the question the last

*17:21.300- 17:28.900* :  rages on amid bleak warnings that it faces the deadliest famine since Ethiopia in the early 1980s.
*17:29.300- 17:34.300* :  Both sides the Sudanese army and the paramilitary rapid support forces have been accused of
*17:34.300- 17:40.360* :  hampering the distribution of desperately needed aid. Dr Yazir Elamin of the Sudanese American
*17:40.360- 17:46.260* :  Physicians Association has just returned from visiting his childhood home in Omdoman across
*17:46.260- 17:51.260* :  the Nile from the Sudanese capital Khartoum and he's been talking to James Coppinal.
*17:51.780- 17:59.080* :  One of the hospitals there I witnessed two three children chair in one bed. These children are
*17:59.080- 18:06.860* :  skin on bone they're fighting for their lives. I witnessed the extreme difficult circumstances that
*18:06.860- 18:13.000* :  doctors and nurses are working under. You could hear bombing in the background very limited
*18:13.820- 18:19.780* :  resources and yet they're doing what they can to try to save these children. Hunger is the number one
*18:19.780- 18:26.880* :  disease in Sudan there is no doubt about it and also I witnessed how many organizations include in
*18:26.880- 18:32.920* :  our own and partnership with UNICEF trying to support these hospitals that are incredibly under
*18:32.920- 18:38.800* :  funded. This is my second time in Sudan since the war erupted. This time my sense of lawlessness
*18:38.800- 18:45.500* :  and instability was greater. Many many civilians have taken up arms. There are multiple multiple
*18:45.500- 18:50.600* :  checkpoints that are set up by civilians wearing civilian clothes and carrying out flashing
*18:50.600- 18:55.440* :  clothes. That was a worrying feature. Part of that is the fact that when the paramilitary group
*18:55.440- 19:01.340* :  the RSF took over Jazeera there was a lot of indiscriminate killing. So based on that a lot of
*19:01.340- 19:06.680* :  the population felt that they were led down by the army and that they needed to defend themselves.
*19:07.240- 19:12.740* :  So that's why you see this widespread carrying of guns and inevitably along the lines
*19:12.740- 19:17.880* :  of ethnic and tribal origin. In terms of the medical care and those
*19:18.800- 19:24.280* :  malnourished children you spoke about sharing a bed. Would I be right in assuming that
*19:24.280- 19:28.700* :  dire and terrible though their situation is they are perhaps the lucky ones. The other children
*19:28.700- 19:34.740* :  simply aren't able to reach a hospital. Yes of course access is the one of the biggest issues in
*19:34.740- 19:42.320* :  Sudan now. Access to medical care and this is actually going to get aggravated by the rainy season.
*19:43.000- 19:48.600* :  So remote parts of Sudan in particularly Darfur and Kordufan which are in the western and the
*19:48.600- 19:54.340* :  southern part of the country are going to be unreachable. So this is again and as I said exaggerate
*19:54.340- 19:59.100* :  the situation a lot. I wonder what it felt like for you personally you're from underman I think
*19:59.100- 20:06.300* :  originally aren't you seeing it again seeing streets you knew well totally disfigured by the
*20:06.300- 20:12.780* :  conflicts how that made you feel. It was kind of a very very emotional for me to go back to
*20:12.780- 20:18.640* :  streets where I grew up. My father passed away three years ago so I visited that area. It was
*20:18.640- 20:24.700* :  incredibly emotional. We all know the numbers but seeing the reality there the hungry kids,
*20:24.700- 20:32.160* :  the desperate doctors I felt that there was no path forward. Dr. Yazir Elemin.
*20:33.280- 20:39.080* :  Over the past eight months of war in Gaza more than 330,000 tonnes of rubbish has built up
*20:39.080- 20:44.960* :  in stinking piles dotted across the territory. Humanitarian agencies say the waste poses a
*20:44.960- 20:50.720* :  catastrophic risk to the health of people already weakened by war, displacement and deprivation
*20:51.120- 20:56.120* :  and the shattered environment. Many people who fled the Israeli military offensive in the southern
*20:56.120- 21:01.700* :  city of Rafa and are living beside these tips and with temperatures soaring in the summer heat
*21:01.700- 21:05.880* :  the problems getting worse as our Middle East correspondent Yulaneel reports.
*21:11.860- 21:18.940* :  Warton Gaza has a new landscape with mountains of rubbish. They've built up as basic services
*21:18.940- 21:24.760* :  have collapsed and for many like Asmahan al-Masri this wasteland is now home.
*21:28.360- 21:33.260* :  We've never lived next to rubbish. I cry just like any other grandmother would over her
*21:33.260- 21:44.280* :  grandchildren being sick and having scabies. Asmahan's family of 16 is squeezed into a tent next
*21:44.280- 21:50.720* :  to a temporary rubbish dump in Harnunis they share their tent with clouds of flies, sometimes
*21:50.720- 22:00.600* :  snakes, everyone complains of the stench. The smell is very disturbing. I keep my tent door open so
*22:00.600- 22:09.460* :  that I can get some air but there's no air just the smell of rubbish. More than a million people
*22:09.460- 22:15.640* :  have been newly displaced by Israel's military assault on Rafa. As they fled elsewhere in southern
*22:15.640- 22:20.700* :  and central Gaza many have found the only places left to live and next to rubbish.
*22:25.080- 22:29.880* :  We looked everywhere for a place for our kids and grandkids. We couldn't find one.
*22:31.540- 22:34.080* :  There was nowhere where 18 people could stay.
*22:35.940- 22:38.740* :  Ali Nasser and his family come from Rafa.
*22:42.020- 22:49.140* :  My children have no jobs, no income. The waste causes diseases. We suffer from vomiting,
*22:49.700- 22:52.420* :  diarrhea and constantly itch is skinned.
*22:54.120- 22:58.380* :  Local councils in areas that people have fled to say they've been overwhelmed,
*22:58.460- 23:04.120* :  they lack equipment and fuel for rubbish trucks. Since the deadly 7th of October attacks,
*23:04.120- 23:09.760* :  Israel has blocked access to the border area where Gaza's main landfill sites are.
*23:11.060- 23:14.440* :  Samrose is from the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees.
*23:14.720- 23:20.040* :  You see as you drive around, we drive around in our armored vehicle so the glass is very thick
*23:20.680- 23:27.220* :  but you can see the flies, you can see the dogs, piles high, kind of 5-6 meters high,
*23:27.260- 23:35.320* :  150 meters long of just, you know, increasingly large and pretty disgusting paths of garbage.
*23:41.500- 23:46.700* :  Now as summer temperatures saw there are new warnings from aid agencies about the health
*23:46.700- 23:52.920* :  hazards posed by so much rubbish. But desperation drives children like Muhammad,
*23:52.920- 23:58.900* :  who's displaced near the Balah to take extra risks, searching for something to eat,
*23:59.220- 24:01.260* :  use or sell in the new dumps.
*24:04.180- 24:08.860* :  We got used to the horrible smell. Every day we come here together to search for cardboard,
*24:08.860- 24:12.900* :  boxes and other things that can be burned to make fire.
*24:16.620- 24:23.140* :  And across Gaza, these stinking piles of waste are a symbol of just how unbearable conditions
*24:23.140- 24:30.020* :  here have become. Yolanael reporting. Across the world, the past few days have provided
*24:30.020- 24:35.980* :  start reminders of the potential dangers of climate change. In Saudi Arabia, more than 500 people
*24:36.020- 24:41.060* :  are believed to have died in Mecca as a result of extreme heat as they took part in the annual
*24:41.060- 24:45.940* :  Hajj pilgrimage. While in the United States, tens of millions of people are bracing themselves
*24:45.940- 24:51.800* :  for a possible record-breaking heat wave. There are just two examples from the global temperature maps
*24:51.800- 24:57.720* :  scoured by the BBC Weather Presenter, Chris Forks. This is quite a typical thing that I see every
*24:57.720- 25:03.200* :  single day in my job. If you look at this, the vast majority of places around the world have
*25:03.200- 25:07.260* :  temperatures above average. And in those places that were picked out, the eastern side of the United
*25:07.440- 25:12.340* :  States, well, there's South America, a lot of that is above average, Africa, Middle East, Europe,
*25:12.820- 25:18.780* :  the northeast of Russia. What we see is when it gets hot, temperatures are often a long way above
*25:18.780- 25:25.200* :  average. There are still some cool areas, parts of Argentina, Mexico, central parts of Russia,
*25:25.740- 25:30.320* :  but often the areas that are a little bit cooler than average are only just a bit cooler than average.
*25:30.660- 25:35.060* :  And if you look at the overall global picture, there are far more parts of the world
*25:35.140- 25:40.120* :  that are seeing above average temperatures than below. And that is the fingerprint of global warming
*25:40.120- 25:45.320* :  that we see. Simon Gosling, Professor of Climate Risks at the University of Nottingham, says
*25:45.320- 25:52.240* :  it's a reminder that climate change is real. That global pattern is driven by the global climate system,
*25:52.580- 25:57.720* :  which over recent decades, we've changed quite significantly from what they were largely
*25:57.720- 26:03.280* :  but going back to pre-industrial times. So over the past 100 years and more, greenhouse gas
*26:03.280- 26:09.060* :  emissions from human activity have essentially started pushing the climate into a new state that
*26:09.140- 26:14.200* :  we've not really seen before in human history at all. So many of the changes are driving the
*26:14.200- 26:18.880* :  conditions we see at the moment. There's evidence showing now that the way humans are altering
*26:18.880- 26:22.720* :  the climate system is affecting really big climate circulations, like the jet stream.
*26:23.020- 26:28.460* :  Also, big systems, many of us have heard of like El Nino and Lenina, for instance, which also
*26:28.460- 26:33.260* :  are responsible for the day-to-day weather we get, but also the extreme events that we see,
*26:33.560- 26:37.760* :  like the heat waves that we're seeing currently in U.S., also that we're seeing having those
*26:38.020- 26:42.840* :  effects on death tolls in Mecca at the moment right now. Those are driven by some very big large
*26:42.840- 26:48.120* :  scale climate systems that we're essentially altering through greenhouse gas emissions that are
*26:48.120- 26:53.540* :  going into the atmosphere and in turn that the greenhouse effect. The difference between what would
*26:53.540- 26:57.860* :  have happened if we've not been emitting greenhouse gases and the situation that we're in now where
*26:57.860- 27:03.840* :  we have been, is that those individual extreme events are becoming more severe. So the heat waves
*27:03.840- 27:09.200* :  were starting to see are becoming hotter. An example would be the situation that we're seeing in
*27:09.200- 27:13.360* :  Saudi Arabia at the moment. The temperatures are well above what they should be. The typical
*27:13.360- 27:18.340* :  average temperature of this time of year is in the low 40s. It's around about 42-43 degrees.
*27:18.940- 27:22.960* :  There's reports in some areas of the region that temperatures have hit about 51 degrees.
*27:23.300- 27:26.940* :  Okay, so about eight degrees higher than what they should be for this time of year. And in a way
*27:26.940- 27:32.140* :  that typifies the effects of global warming, individual extreme events like heat waves basically
*27:32.500- 27:37.120* :  get hotter. The other thing that we see is that those kind of extreme events become more frequent.
*27:37.800- 27:43.940* :  Simon Gosling of Nottingham University. A group of U.S. lawmakers have met the exiled Tibetan
*27:43.940- 27:49.240* :  spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, at his monastery in northern India. The administration of President
*27:49.240- 27:54.780* :  Joe Biden has recently stepped up its engagement on the Tibet issue. A South Asia editor and
*27:54.780- 28:00.560* :  Balesen Etherogen has more details. The visit by the American lawmakers is part of an attempt
*28:00.560- 28:07.720* :  by Washington to reengage with Tibet amid increasing tensions with Beijing. It follows the passage
*28:07.720- 28:14.300* :  of a bill by the U.S. Congress that seeks to encourage China to hold talks with Tibetan leaders
*28:14.300- 28:20.160* :  that have been frozen since 2010. President Biden is expected to sign the bill soon.
*28:20.760- 28:25.840* :  Ahead of the meeting, the Chinese embassy in Delhi said that the Dalai Lama was a political
*28:25.840- 28:33.680* :  exile engaged in anti-China activities. And Balesen Etherogen. And finally, one of the smelliest
*28:33.680- 28:39.700* :  plants on earth has bloomed at the world-famous Q Botanical Gardens in London. To find out more
*28:39.700- 28:44.660* :  about the aptly named Corpse Flower, Emma Barnett has been talking to Paul Reese, whose head of
*28:44.660- 28:52.340* :  Q's tropical nursery. So it's a morph of Bales titanium, which is a plant in their erasie
*28:52.360- 29:01.160* :  family, and it's coming to bloom. They don't bloom that regularly. This one I think bloomed about
*29:01.160- 29:09.160* :  two or three years ago. And when it's in bloom, it's a very large structure. This one's measure is
*29:09.160- 29:18.600* :  about 2.3 meters tall from the top of the compost to the top of the bloom. And when it's in
*29:18.600- 29:24.640* :  its peak, it smells really bad. It's like an animal crawled into the glass house and died in the
*29:24.640- 29:30.720* :  corner. It's a really strong fast bench. Did you all gather around to have a sniff? Yeah, many
*29:30.720- 29:36.000* :  people, I think, stuck their head into it and to have a good smell. I think you probably only
*29:36.000- 29:39.580* :  do it once a while. And then you're done. And you remember, it's funny how you can really remember
*29:39.580- 29:47.220* :  smells. Why does it need to smell? What's the function of it? So it's primarily to be pollinated.
*29:47.900- 29:55.500* :  So plants attract pollinators in order to get cross-pollination to get them to set seed.
*29:55.500- 30:03.660* :  And the morph of Bales smells like rotting meat to attract us pollinators, which are probably
*30:04.660- 30:10.900* :  mostly carrying flies and potentially carrying beetles that would go normally to a rotting corpse
*30:11.840- 30:15.600* :  and then lay their eggs in amongst the corpse and then the maggots would then feed on the corpse.
*30:16.240- 30:24.140* :  So the types of marimbs have tricked these flies to come visit it. And in the process,
*30:24.780- 30:31.400* :  get covered in pollen and transferred pollen onto the female flowers. It's not actually a single
*30:31.400- 30:37.140* :  flower. It's what's known as an inflorescence. So it's actually, it looks like one single flower.
*30:37.160- 30:42.700* :  But actually, if you looked inside, you find there's lots of small male flowers and female flowers
*30:42.700- 30:48.660* :  at the base of it. And are people still able to come now? Is it still in full stench?
*30:49.980- 30:59.900* :  Yes, it's a very short flowering event. So they're normally only last between 36 to maybe 48 hours.
*31:00.420- 31:09.040* :  So it opens yesterday morning, a bit more to lunch. So today, I haven't seen it this morning,
*31:09.040- 31:15.380* :  but today will still be open and then probably by tomorrow it would be on its way to closing.
*31:16.280- 31:20.440* :  In full stench, great phrase. That was Paul Reese talking there to Emma Barnett.
*31:22.580- 31:25.620* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
