*00:17.720- 00:21.580* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring
*00:21.580- 00:22.760* :  our prices down.
*00:23.200- 00:27.000* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer, which is apparently a thing.

*00:58.660- 01:00.180* :  Hey, are you ready for this?

*01:19.160- 01:23.000* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.440- 01:30.400* :  And Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 12th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:30.400- 01:35.800* :  A US court has found President Biden's son Hunter guilty of reaching gun laws.
*01:36.400- 01:39.280* :  Hamas has responded to the latest peace proposal for Gaza.
*01:39.620- 01:43.800* :  It wants Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of its forces.
*01:44.520- 01:51.320* :  A new government has been formed in Haiti, as the Caribbean country tries to restore order amid a rise in gang violence.
*01:54.060- 02:00.900* :  And also in this podcast, the Japanese scientist Akira Endo, who discovered statins, has died at the age of 90,
*02:01.380- 02:03.040* :  without winning an Abell Award.
*02:03.320- 02:08.700* :  Amazingly, the man who began the process of working out how to deal with the problem of cholesterol
*02:08.920- 02:11.640* :  and provide a treatment that's benefited him very very much.
*02:11.640- 02:13.980* :  Many many many people never got the prize.
*02:17.660- 02:22.400* :  Donald Trump made history by becoming the first former president to be convicted of felony,
*02:22.880- 02:24.040* :  in a New York court.
*02:24.640- 02:29.480* :  Now, the son of a president, Hunter Biden, has been found guilty in a court in Wilmington,
*02:29.900- 02:32.940* :  in the US state of Delaware, on federal gun charges.
*02:33.660- 02:40.040* :  Joe Biden's son lied about his drug use on a form while buying a firearm back in 2018.
*02:40.040- 02:46.360* :  No cameras were allowed in court, but the BBC's Brent Devisman was there when the verdict was read out.
*02:46.860- 02:49.480* :  It was very tense. You can hear a pen drop in that court house.
*02:49.500- 02:52.120* :  No whispers, nothing, no one was speaking.
*02:52.120- 02:57.000* :  And then as they started reading the verdict, Mr. Biden had his arms folded across his chest.
*02:57.140- 02:58.220* :  He was looking straight ahead.
*02:58.220- 03:02.180* :  There was very little emotional kind of visceral reaction.
*03:02.860- 03:07.460* :  Just after the verdict was read, he turned and hugged two members of his legal team that were sitting next to him.
*03:07.500- 03:09.880* :  And then a few minutes later, court adjourned.
*03:10.280- 03:11.840* :  He hugged his lawyer, Abby Lowell.
*03:11.940- 03:13.720* :  They seemed to say a few words to each other.
*03:14.100- 03:18.040* :  And then he walked straight to his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, hugged her, kissed her.
*03:18.040- 03:21.080* :  And then they walked out together quickly flanked by a security officer.
*03:21.880- 03:27.240* :  Hunter Biden, who's 54 years old, said he was disappointed by the verdict and would appeal.
*03:27.800- 03:32.000* :  In a statement, his father said he remained proud of how his son had fought addiction.
*03:32.600- 03:35.440* :  I spoke to our correspondent outside the court, Khan Aspin.
*03:35.900- 03:40.940* :  This was a case that many people felt was pretty overwhelming against Hunter Biden.
*03:40.940- 03:46.360* :  The prosecution brought a mountain of evidence, really detailing his battle with addiction,
*03:46.360- 03:52.180* :  his use of crack cocaine around the time that he purchased this gun back in October of 2018.
*03:52.180- 03:56.060* :  We saw text messages and photographs in the courtroom.
*03:56.060- 04:02.340* :  We actually even heard snippets, audio portions of his own memoir played out in the courtroom,
*04:02.340- 04:04.480* :  essentially using his own words against him.
*04:04.860- 04:11.240* :  In the end, the jury deliberated for only about three hours before coming back into that courtroom
*04:11.240- 04:18.400* :  and reading out each guilty verdict, one by one, guilty here today on all three of these felony counts.
*04:18.780- 04:23.240* :  Hunter Biden now really a historic moment, becoming the first child of a sitting president
*04:23.700- 04:25.660* :  to be convicted of a crime in a federal courtroom.
*04:26.000- 04:29.960* :  Now we understand that sentencing will take place within the next few months.
*04:30.280- 04:31.640* :  So, Carl, could he face prison?
*04:32.540- 04:33.920* :  We don't have a sentencing date yet.
*04:33.920- 04:39.320* :  It's expected to take place before 120 days, so within the next four months or so.
*04:40.140- 04:43.480* :  The guidelines here call for about 10 to 12 months in prison.
*04:43.480- 04:48.180* :  The maximum time he's facing is 25 years, so they are serious charges.
*04:48.680- 04:53.500* :  Depending on who you ask, many legal experts say he's very unlikely to face a long prison time.
*04:53.500- 04:57.040* :  It's possible that he won't face any jail time at all.
*04:57.040- 04:59.480* :  It could be up to the judge, really, in this case.
*04:59.500- 05:01.960* :  We could see a fine, we could see probation.
*05:02.680- 05:05.240* :  And, of course, he faces another trial, doesn't he, in September?
*05:05.620- 05:08.420* :  He does, and these are serious charges as well.
*05:08.420- 05:14.060* :  This involves tax evasion, essentially not paying more than a million dollars in taxes.
*05:14.760- 05:20.480* :  That is also expected to be a trial where we will see some lurid details come out,
*05:20.480- 05:25.460* :  about Hunter Biden's life, the government there accusing him of rather than paying his taxes,
*05:25.460- 05:29.480* :  spending his money on things like drugs, on things like prostitutes.
*05:29.480- 05:35.480* :  So, he's not out of the legal woods yet, and the Biden family and the Democratic Party in general
*05:35.480- 05:42.960* :  can brace potentially for more embarrassing details to come out about the son of President Joe Biden.
*05:43.220- 05:46.380* :  And I suppose the big question everyone will be wondering,
*05:46.440- 05:51.360* :  is will this affect the election, the election, due in November?
*05:51.920- 05:57.200* :  It's hard to tell, because so many voters in the United States seem to have already made up their minds.
*05:57.200- 06:03.360* :  So, what this conviction here could do is sway some percentage of people one way or the other.
*06:03.840- 06:09.460* :  One theory could be that this is harmful for the Democrats and for Joe Biden, for his reelection campaign.
*06:09.460- 06:15.420* :  Of course, he wants to point to his likely opponent, Donald Trump, as someone who himself is a convicted criminal,
*06:15.420- 06:19.180* :  who just was convicted in a New York court not very long ago.
*06:19.180- 06:27.500* :  On the other hand, we've heard Donald Trump repeatedly claim that Joe Biden has been using the powers of the government against him,
*06:27.540- 06:32.480* :  that he's been setting the justice department against Donald Trump unfairly.
*06:32.480- 06:36.040* :  Well, this may undermine somewhat that argument.
*06:36.040- 06:41.080* :  If the son of the sitting president is indeed being prosecuted in federal court,
*06:41.860- 06:46.400* :  it would be difficult to argue that there is a bias within the United States justice system.
*06:46.680- 06:53.200* :  We'll see which one of those arguments comes to the fore here, but no doubt this will be a talking point on the campaign trail,
*06:53.200- 06:58.160* :  and I'm sure this is not the last step we will hear of this criminal conviction here today in Delaware.
*06:58.860- 07:05.360* :  Carl Nazman, unorth America editor Sarah Smith, who's also in Wilmington, looks at the background to the trial.
*07:05.940- 07:12.480* :  Drugs, guns, prostitutes, this trial was peppered with a multitude of lurid details about Hunter Biden's private life
*07:13.040- 07:16.400* :  and the chaos that came from his self-acknowledged addiction to crack cocaine.
*07:17.200- 07:22.460* :  The charges against him related specifically to whether Mr. Biden had committed a crime by lying on a form
*07:22.460- 07:27.540* :  about his drug use when he bought a 38 caliber revolver in October 2018.
*07:28.360- 07:34.320* :  That gun, along with remnants of crack and drug paraphernalia, were discovered in his car by his then partner,
*07:34.320- 07:40.020* :  Halle Biden, who was also his sister-in-law, the widow of his brother, Bull, who died of cancer three years earlier.
*07:40.460- 07:44.880* :  Prosecutor's showed video of her trying to dispose of the weapon in a dumpster, and she told the court,
*07:45.200- 07:47.840* :  I realize it was a stupid idea now, but I was panicking.
*07:48.480- 07:49.980* :  Why did you panic as the prosecutor?
*07:50.540- 07:54.360* :  Because I didn't want him to hurt himself and I didn't want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.
*07:55.140- 07:58.780* :  Mr. Biden's ex-wife described how she found a crack pipe in their house,
*07:59.160- 08:01.740* :  and ex-girlfriend said he would smoke crack every 20 minutes,
*08:02.240- 08:06.600* :  and Halle Biden said she had seen Hunter with a rock of the drug the size of a ping pong ball.
*08:06.920- 08:10.520* :  Hunter Biden had already chronicled his struggles with drug addiction in a book,
*08:11.000- 08:15.620* :  excerpts of which were entered into evidence read by the author himself in the audio version.
*08:16.160- 08:21.020* :  My drug use accelerated in tandem with my stress, smoking crack cocaine every three days,
*08:21.020- 08:26.100* :  soon became smoking every two days, then every other day, then every hour of every day.
*08:26.440- 08:31.060* :  Throughout the case, the defense argued that Hunter Biden believed himself clean in October 2018,
*08:31.660- 08:35.840* :  saying it didn't matter whether he was using drugs in the years or months before he bought the gun,
*08:35.840- 08:40.640* :  only if he was taking drugs when he stated on a federal form he was not a drug user.
*08:41.060- 08:45.780* :  Hunter Biden's stepmother, Dr. Jill Biden, the first lady of the United States attended the trial,
*08:46.000- 08:47.160* :  sitting in the public gallery.
*08:47.720- 08:51.880* :  The president himself issued a statement saying he was proud of his son for beating his addiction,
*08:52.300- 08:55.000* :  and confirmed he would not pardon his son if convicted.
*08:55.680- 08:59.480* :  After the conviction of Donald Trump in New York for falsifying business records,
*08:59.500- 09:03.840* :  these criminal trials are inevitably being dragged into the election campaign,
*09:04.140- 09:07.080* :  with people on both sides trying to use them to their own advantage.
*09:07.840- 09:08.400* :  Sarah Smith.
*09:09.340- 09:15.660* :  Hamas has responded to the latest Gaza Peace Plan, saying that though it views the three-phase proposal favorably,
*09:16.080- 09:19.060* :  it wants an Israeli commitment to a permanent ceasefire.
*09:19.560- 09:24.820* :  The Palestinian militant group also insists on a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
*09:25.500- 09:29.960* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already said that he won't agree to end the war
*09:30.280- 09:32.260* :  until Hamas has been totally defeated.
*09:33.040- 09:38.300* :  Washington's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken, who's in the region, says discussions taking place
*09:38.300- 09:43.040* :  over the next couple of days would also touch on post-war plans for Gaza.
*09:43.880- 09:47.000* :  Julian Marshall spoke to the BBC's Hugo Bacheca, who's in Jerusalem,
*09:47.000- 09:52.180* :  and asked him if we can say that Hamas has accepted the proposed peace plan.
*09:52.540- 09:56.880* :  I think the response is a little bit more complicated than a simple yes or no.
*09:56.880- 10:02.100* :  So they've expressed redness to reach a deal. They say they are reacting positively,
*10:02.100- 10:05.660* :  but they are sticking to their initial demands.
*10:05.660- 10:09.480* :  So they want a guarantee that there will be a permanent ceasefire in Gaza
*10:09.940- 10:14.560* :  and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.
*10:14.560- 10:22.120* :  So again, just to recap the proposal, this was something that President Biden announced 11 days ago.
*10:22.120- 10:30.360* :  He described it as an Israeli proposal, a three-stage plan that would see hostages being freed in the initial phase,
*10:31.060- 10:35.820* :  and this phase would pave the way for a permanent cessation of hostility.
*10:35.820- 10:43.840* :  So the end of the war, and now Hamas is demanding a guarantee that this would lead to a permanent ceasefire.
*10:44.860- 10:50.300* :  Obviously they're concerned that once the hostages are out, if there's no guarantee that there will be a permanent ceasefire,
*10:50.300- 10:56.480* :  they think that the Israeli military will return to Gaza to continue with the military offensive against the group.
*10:56.480- 10:59.720* :  So this is the Hamas response to the proposal.
*10:59.720- 11:05.460* :  We've heard from Qatar and Egypt, which have been mediating these talks.
*11:05.460- 11:12.340* :  They say they have received this response and they are going to coordinate the next steps together with the United States.
*11:12.880- 11:21.500* :  There also seems to be some confusion about where the Israeli government stands on this peace plan.
*11:21.500- 11:29.680* :  I mean, it's been described as a U.S. Israeli plan, Anthony Blinken says Israel has accepted it,
*11:29.680- 11:39.360* :  and yet the public statements we hear from Benjamin Netanyahu are a repeat of previous statements, namely that this war is not going to end
*11:39.500- 11:44.280* :  until Hamas is eliminated and all the hostages are released.
*11:44.500- 11:48.340* :  So what are we to make of Israel's current position?
*11:48.620- 11:54.480* :  It's very interesting because today, Anthony Blinken, who is obviously backing the region to put pressure on both sides,
*11:54.500- 12:03.880* :  but especially on Hamas to accept this plan, he said he had received reassurances from a Prime Minister Netanyahu that he would support the plan.
*12:03.880- 12:14.420* :  But what is interesting is that the Prime Minister hasn't at least in public given his full unequivocal support for the plan that was announced by President Biden.
*12:14.620- 12:25.060* :  And again, he is facing pressure from multiple fronts, from the families of the hostages, from Israel's main international partners who are demanding a deal,
*12:25.060- 12:38.080* :  but also from those more radical allies in his government, these far right ministers who have threatened to quit this coalition, which could lead to the collapse of the government, if this proposal goes ahead.
*12:38.080- 12:53.840* :  So many here in Israel believe that the Prime Minister is giving these vague statements because he wants to keep his options open, many believe that he's now caught between two options, the survival of his coalition or his ceasefire with Hamas.
*12:54.280- 13:07.640* :  Yuga Bachega in Jerusalem. The Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court says his office is urgently investigating allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Sudanese city of El Fasha.
*13:07.640- 13:15.660* :  Karim Khan said investigators had seen credible allegations of what looked like ethnically motivated attacks against civilians.
*13:15.660- 13:24.420* :  The evidence my office has collected to date seems to show credible continuous allegations of attacks against the civilian population.
*13:24.800- 13:39.500* :  It seems to show the widespread prevalence use of rape and other forms of sexual violence. It seems to disclose consistently the shelling of civilian areas, the looting of properties and attacks against hospitals.
*13:40.340- 13:50.220* :  The ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the rapid support forces or RSF started 14 months ago. Here's our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross.
*13:50.660- 13:59.260* :  The RSF forces trying to capture the city from the Sudanese army have denied committing abuses, but civilians fleeing for their lives speak of relentless atrocities.
*13:59.260- 14:12.660* :  Any potential indictment from the ICC may still take some time. What rights groups are calling for now is immediate international pressure on the RSF's backers, including the United Arab Emirates. Officials in Abu Dhabi deny any involvement.
*14:13.560- 14:26.040* :  Will Ross. The mayor of the embattled Ukrainian city of Khiv says the situation has been calmer since the U.S. gave Khiv permission to use its weapons to launch counter strikes into Russian territory.
*14:26.040- 14:33.760* :  Yihar Terikov said being able to hit Russian missile launch positions had made a difference. From Khiv, Gene McKenzie reports.
*14:34.440- 14:46.020* :  It's been almost two weeks now since President Biden gave Ukraine the OK to use its arms to strike limited targets in Russia, something President Zelensky had been asking for privately and publicly for months.
*14:46.080- 14:53.640* :  His army has since been able to target the Russian military equipment that was being used to pound the border region and city of Khiv.
*14:54.040- 15:01.560* :  Because of this, the city's mayor Mr Terikov said the situation had been calmer, though he said there have been an increase in shelling over the past two days.
*15:02.640- 15:12.120* :  Gene McKenzie in Ukraine. The Japanese scientist Akira Endo, who discovered statins, the drugs that lower cholesterol has died at the age of 90.
*15:12.620- 15:19.960* :  He studied fungi and isolated the first statin from a sample of blue mold taken from a rice store in 1973.
*15:19.960- 15:32.480* :  I House reporter Michel Roberts looks back at his career. Akira Endo is said to have been inspired by Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin to start studying mold or fungi.
*15:32.480- 15:44.120* :  By 1973, that work led to Professor Endo finding the very first cholesterol-lowering compound that can slash the risk of heart disease and strokes.
*15:44.180- 15:51.080* :  Doctors now routinely prescribe statins to people who've had a heart attack and are at higher risk of heart disease.
*15:52.000- 15:59.420* :  Unlike Fleming, though, his discovery didn't earn a Nobel Prize. Professor Brian Williams is from the British Heart Foundation.
*16:00.200- 16:14.420* :  He was always, I think, in the frame for the Nobel Prize. Amazingly, the man who began the process of working out how to deal with the problem of cholesterol and provide a treatment that's benefited and very relies on many, many minutes.
*16:14.420- 16:17.360* :  People never got the prize. I think that's a shame.
*16:17.760- 16:24.280* :  Born in rural Japan in 1933, Professor Endo went on to study biochemistry at university.
*16:24.500- 16:30.960* :  It was while working for the pharmaceutical company Sankyo in Tokyo that he made his big discovery.
*16:31.560- 16:37.860* :  It took years of studying thousands of fungi before he found a compound that lowered cholesterol.
*16:38.720- 16:48.640* :  First attempts at harnessing it proved too toxic for humans, but other pharmaceutical companies started to search for similar compounds to make into a medicine.
*16:49.080- 16:56.960* :  And in September 1987, the first statin, lower statin, was approved in the US for clinical use.
*16:57.480- 17:00.480* :  Since then, statins have saved countless lives.
*17:04.900- 17:05.580* :  Still to come?
*17:05.580- 17:16.360* :  The gang are thought to have tunneled their way along hundreds of meters beneath Rome's Trevi fountain using a pneumatic drill to break out into the shop on the prestigious Via de Condotti.
*17:17.040- 17:20.760* :  However, a dual theft in Italy has caused a bit of a stink.
*17:29.200- 17:30.920* :  So, how do we get AI right?
*17:31.360- 17:38.480* :  Well, we need the right volume of data, the software to train it and massive compute power or...
*17:38.700- 17:40.100* :  Another one bites the dust.
*17:40.840- 17:41.320* :  Are you ready?
*17:41.500- 17:42.820* :  Hey, are you ready for this?
*17:43.080- 17:44.480* :  Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
*17:44.660- 17:51.060* :  But with HPE GreenLake, we get access to supercomputing to power AI at the scale we need, helping generate better insights.

*18:36.020- 18:38.040* :  This is the Global News Podcast.
*18:39.060- 18:43.820* :  For the last few months, Haiti has been driven by gang violence and political chaos.
*18:43.820- 18:47.960* :  The former Prime Minister, Ariel Henri, was ousted from office in April.
*18:47.960- 18:57.600* :  And now the new Prime Minister, Gary Connell, appointed two weeks ago, has formed a new government tasked with restoring security and stability in the Caribbean nation.
*18:58.200- 19:00.540* :  So, will this help calm the situation?
*19:00.540- 19:03.520* :  Is our Latin America correspondent Will Grant?
*19:04.180- 19:11.440* :  I think it will have impact for those who are watching who are just wanting to see a little bit more political stability return to Haiti.
*19:11.480- 19:16.080* :  Those inside the country who are thinking, you know, the first steps need to be put in place.
*19:16.300- 19:20.300* :  We saw not so long ago the International Airport in Porto Prince reopen.
*19:20.480- 19:23.040* :  That's going to help aid get in, for example.
*19:23.480- 19:26.360* :  It's going to allow there to be some commercial flights in and out.
*19:26.800- 19:32.780* :  This is another step along that path towards something that begins to look like stability.
*19:32.820- 19:39.080* :  It may still be a long way off, but I think that when you have the key cabinet positions in all of those key positions,
*19:39.080- 19:46.320* :  justice and public security, foreign affairs, Prime Minister himself taking the interior ministry position as well,
*19:46.780- 19:56.960* :  it does at least help bring some kind of basis of stability to it, but the question of whether it's just a veneer or if there will be actually lasting stability underneath.
*19:57.280- 19:58.720* :  And how bad is it in Haiti?
*19:58.900- 20:08.060* :  Well, I don't think it's improved at all. It was only really a few weeks and months ago that the UN Security Council were warning of a critical situation in the country.
*20:08.060- 20:15.420* :  So many killed on the streets of the capital, gangs in charge of somewhere in the region of 80% of the capital,
*20:15.420- 20:21.480* :  schools still closed, businesses shutted, very, very little of that has changed in any meaningful way since then.
*20:21.480- 20:29.460* :  And you add the humanitarian situation on top, the inability to get in aid while the airport was closed for so many weeks has been, you know,
*20:29.960- 20:35.300* :  it's a daily struggle for everybody simply to find enough food to get to work, if they have to travel to work,
*20:35.760- 20:39.020* :  to get clean water for children to get education and so on and so forth.
*20:39.440- 20:41.820* :  It's hard to see how the government's going to change that.
*20:42.120- 20:47.360* :  It is. And I think a lot of eyes are obviously on the role of the Kenyan police officers.
*20:47.700- 20:54.480* :  There's this idea that a planned deployment of around a thousand initial officers from Kenya, the Kenyan President William Ruto,
*20:55.080- 20:58.480* :  giving his backing to that idea, but it still hasn't yet materialized.
*20:58.600- 21:01.140* :  There's been a lot of talk. It's meant to be any day now.
*21:01.700- 21:06.240* :  And, of course, many, many people on the streets, not just to put a branch, but across Haiti really,
*21:06.580- 21:12.100* :  wondering exactly how Kenyan police officers can prevail where Haitian ones haven't been able to.
*21:12.740- 21:20.160* :  Will Grant, the technology company Apple has unveiled plans to integrate artificial intelligence into its products.
*21:20.160- 21:30.160* :  Apple intelligence will not be an app in its own right, but will be embedded across many apps to assist with activities such as messaging and supplying travel directions.
*21:30.160- 21:37.020* :  The company has been largely absent from the avalanche of AI products released by other tech firms in recent months
*21:37.560- 21:40.960* :  and has been facing pressure to introduce new AI features.
*21:41.620- 21:44.620* :  Here's Apple's chief executive Tim Cook explaining the changes.
*21:45.380- 21:46.980* :  Introducing Apple Intelligence.
*21:47.780- 21:54.000* :  The new personal intelligence system that makes sure most personal products even more useful and delightful.
*21:54.620- 21:59.440* :  Which has, in turn, given Apple's critics and doubters, a whole new set of questions.
*21:59.500- 22:07.320* :  Tim Franks heard more about the company's plans from the BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman, who was at London Tech Week.
*22:07.840- 22:11.660* :  I think what you'll start to see, but bear in mind, this is going to happen much later in the year,
*22:11.660- 22:15.700* :  and it will probably start in the US with the rollout of Apple's new operating system.
*22:15.700- 22:21.140* :  You've got iOS 18 coming to the iPhone and Sequoia coming to Mac laptops.
*22:21.140- 22:26.660* :  What you'll start to see is that there'll just be a more seamless experience without you jumping between apps.
*22:26.720- 22:31.180* :  So for example, in the presentation that we saw a calendar event appear,
*22:31.180- 22:37.280* :  and then you could also get directions to tell you where to go how to get to that without having to jump to the map app first.
*22:37.740- 22:41.540* :  And there was another demo where somebody said, you know, can you message my daughter?
*22:41.540- 22:47.080* :  Because it was able to see your data and to see who it is that you're referring to as your daughter,
*22:47.080- 22:53.080* :  it was able to identify the correct contact within your contact book in order to bring up that message with the daughter.
*22:53.080- 22:56.980* :  So what's important to say is that Apple isn't launching a new standalone service here.
*22:56.980- 23:01.780* :  There's not going to be an Apple intelligence. That's what they call a game app or service or products.
*23:01.780- 23:04.800* :  It would just be embedded into everything that you use already.
*23:04.800- 23:10.860* :  And it will start to make that experience apple says more personal and smarter for you.
*23:11.080- 23:18.500* :  Yeah, which I guess some people might see as being utterly fantastic and seamless and others might think it's a bit spooky and a bit, you know,
*23:18.500- 23:25.420* :  there are big questions about privacy and where this sort of information and the links that are being made where they end up.
*23:25.620- 23:28.240* :  Well, we talk about Apple being late to the party with AI.
*23:28.500- 23:33.160* :  Don't you know, there's been an absolute explosion of AI products in the last 18 months or so.
*23:33.160- 23:36.720* :  And Apple's been notably absent from most of those conversations.
*23:36.860- 23:38.580* :  We know they haven't been doing nothing.
*23:38.580- 23:45.900* :  They've been working on something, but actually what you've fundamentally got here is a juxtaposition between what Apple wants to do and what it needs to do.
*23:46.160- 23:48.400* :  And that is it is so privacy-focused.
*23:48.500- 23:57.160* :  It sells its products, doesn't it, on the promise of privacy, you know, customers pay top dollar for Apple devices because they like the privacy first approach.
*23:57.580- 24:02.800* :  On the other hand, if you're using AI, AI needs vast amounts of data to be trained on.
*24:02.800- 24:04.620* :  It's got to get that data from somewhere.
*24:04.820- 24:11.380* :  And if it's going to be your own personal assistant, then in order to be truly useful to you, it's got to access your personal data.
*24:11.580- 24:13.620* :  So there's a real dilemma there, isn't there?
*24:13.940- 24:26.580* :  And Apple has now revealed what it thinks is the way forward, which is first of all to have as much of the AI processing work as possible happen on device on your iPhone, for example, which is where all of your data already is.
*24:26.900- 24:34.340* :  And it says, if there's something that needs to be done that's more powerful than the chips in your phone can manage, then it will be sent to a private cloud.
*24:34.340- 24:39.240* :  And the data won't be stored there. And that is sort of Apple's path through this.
*24:39.240- 24:41.400* :  It's a different approach to what we've seen before.
*24:41.400- 24:50.040* :  But what's also interesting, I think, is that it revealed that it's going to collaborate with open AI, which makes the chatbot that we all know in love, chat GPT.
*24:50.480- 24:52.880* :  And they have a very different approach to privacy.
*24:52.880- 24:56.080* :  Now you'll be able to select whether or not you want to use chat GPT.
*24:56.380- 25:02.820* :  And of course millions of people do, but the fact is that it will still then be accessing that very personal data that Apple is trying to protect.
*25:03.580- 25:06.160* :  BBC Technology Editor, Zoe Kleinman.
*25:06.880- 25:22.340* :  Now to France, where two days after President Macron made a surprise announcement of a snap election, the leader of the conservative Republican's party, Eric Siotti, is aiming for an alliance with the hard-right national rally led in Parliament by Marine Le Pen.
*25:22.340- 25:32.500* :  There's been widespread opposition to the move from within the Republican's party, but it's been welcomed by Marine Le Pen herself, as well as the National Rally's president, Jordan Biden.
*25:33.820- 25:36.940* :  I asked our Paris correspondent, Yusko Field, how big a deal this is.
*25:37.440- 25:50.340* :  In and of itself, it's very big in the sense that it's the first time that the head of the Republican's party, the former Gaulist party has ever said that he's prepared to get into bed with the hard-right, traditional enemies.
*25:50.880- 25:58.100* :  So saying this is a big deal, the thing is, he's not bringing it in with him, and he doesn't seem like it.
*25:58.100- 26:09.920* :  So what looked like a massive story at the beginning of the day, which was that the Republican's party, the Gaulist party, linking up with the national rally and forming this new block, it's not happening.
*26:09.920- 26:20.680* :  What's happening is that their leader has made this personal initiative to move across, but he's been disavowed by practically everyone at the top of the Republican's party.
*26:20.980- 26:29.440* :  So what we have is another story, which is the kind of explosion of the Republican's party, as they start forming a part and fighting over what their leader has done.
*26:29.480- 26:31.780* :  I mean, there are people now who are the second and the second and the third.
*26:31.780- 26:37.900* :  I think treason, treason, treason are leader has gone to the opposite of our enemy, and they're very angry.
*26:37.900- 26:44.640* :  So what hasn't happened is a mass movement of the Republicans into the orbit of the national rally.
*26:44.860- 26:53.160* :  What you do have, though, is their leader doing this, and then that in itself is significant and shows how everything is very, very fluid at the moment in French politics.
*26:53.940- 27:02.660* :  You say French politics is very fluid, because, of course, I mean, general Charles de Gaulle, I mean, this goes back to the Second World War, doesn't it, for those who don't know their French history?
*27:02.880- 27:06.040* :  Yeah, I mean, that's why it's so kind of startling.
*27:06.100- 27:11.040* :  I mean, if you look at the history of these two parties, the Republicans are the heirs of the Gaulists,
*27:11.360- 27:15.360* :  Charles de Gaulle, and all he stood for coming out at the Second World War, all that.
*27:15.360- 27:23.100* :  The national rally are the heirs of the national front, who are the heirs of my other things, the people who hated General de Gaulle,
*27:23.100- 27:33.840* :  who, you know, early part of their early membership, were people who had been in the OAS, who came out terrorist acts against De Gaulle's people, you know, who hated him.
*27:33.960- 27:46.460* :  So the two parties after this history of mutual hate and loathing, but I think what's significant about all this, and I think what's significant about everything that's happened today, is just how far it shows we're moving out of the post-war era.
*27:49.760- 27:59.820* :  With the UK General Election just over three weeks away, a cohort of at least two million British people who live abroad will be able to vote because of a recent rule change.
*27:59.820- 28:09.800* :  Expats, who'd stayed away more than 15 years, lost their right to cast a ballot, but now they'll have a say if they wish in the pull on July 4th.
*28:10.240- 28:16.840* :  Our Europe correspondent Nick Beak traveled to the south of Spain, home to more British expats than anywhere else in Europe.
*28:21.320- 28:26.600* :  In the birthplace of Flamenco, proud tradition echoes through the Andalusian hills.
*28:28.880- 28:34.560* :  Today's performers at the outdoor auditorium in Mejas are Amateurs, most over 70.
*28:35.360- 28:41.960* :  This rhythm of life has long captivated British visitors. So much so, they decided to stay.
*28:42.240- 28:49.060* :  There aren't any leaves in this today, it hasn't been too windy overnight, luckily. I like to have it nice and clean because I go in most days.
*28:49.720- 28:59.800* :  Jill Shadlow moved to her house in Spain full time in 1998, but once she'd been here 15 years, she lost the right to vote in UK General Elections.
*29:00.400- 29:04.220* :  The recent law change means she can vote once again next month.
*29:04.460- 29:17.820* :  I'm very pleased to have some sort of stake in what goes on in the UK again, albeit just one vote, and having been very frustrated and actually distressed not to have had a vote when the Brexit referendum happened.
*29:18.380- 29:20.300* :  I'm very pleased that things have changed now.
*29:27.780- 29:35.500* :  At the weekly Al Fresco quiz at Chambers bar in the old town, the vast majority of the two dozen participants are British.
*29:35.500- 29:37.540* :  This is very competitive in there.
*29:38.820- 29:43.560* :  10% of the population of Mejas municipality hail from the UK.
*29:43.560- 29:50.700* :  The second question is, will anyone be voting in the British General Election on July 4th?
*29:51.340- 29:55.020* :  Hands in the air please. Nearly everyone's hands go up.
*29:56.120- 30:00.340* :  Many hears say they still feel invested in Britain, even if they left long ago.
*30:00.500- 30:02.700* :  At the end of the day I'm British through and through.
*30:02.920- 30:05.100* :  Including Jane Stevenson from Bournemouth.
*30:05.280- 30:09.140* :  My son lives there, my mother, my family are all in the UK.
*30:09.720- 30:14.420* :  And it's nice to be able to participate possibly to have our opinions.
*30:14.420- 30:16.900* :  So yes, we have a lot of interest with the politics.
*30:17.260- 30:19.940* :  Lynn Davie left Hampshire for the Costa del Sol.
*30:20.200- 30:30.680* :  I used to be a teacher and I'm very keen on seeing that teachers' rights are protected and the conditions in schools and also the welfare in the national health.
*30:30.680- 30:35.340* :  I mean one day I may go back and of course hospitals are very important.
*30:35.820- 30:38.820* :  Bill Anderson has been living in Spain for 22 years.
*30:39.400- 30:41.240* :  April caught the bottom down here.
*30:41.340- 30:44.340* :  And says he feels much more invested here than in the UK.
*30:44.780- 30:46.540* :  Election in the UK, July 4th.
*30:46.740- 30:47.660* :  Will you be voting in that?
*30:47.900- 30:54.620* :  No, I won't be voting in it because I've gone left the UK behind and Spain, Mejas is my home.
*30:54.860- 30:59.160* :  I'm not even sure that I would feel right trying to influence what happens in the UK.
*30:59.160- 31:03.300* :  I don't live there, I don't pay my taxes there, I won't be voting.
*31:04.060- 31:08.980* :  British expat, Bill Anderson, ending that report by Nick Beak in southern Spain.
*31:09.980- 31:14.080* :  If you were offered 50 years a month to adopt a stray dog, would you do it?
*31:14.560- 31:20.660* :  Well, it's how the authorities in Kosovo's capital, Prishtira, are trying to solve a problem with homeless animals.
*31:21.140- 31:23.480* :  Here's our Balkans correspondent, Guy Deloni.
*31:24.000- 31:30.200* :  There's no shortage of homeless dogs in Kosovo's capital.
*31:30.500- 31:34.880* :  At least 4,000 strays live on the streets of Prishtira.
*31:35.280- 31:39.040* :  That's the official figure, some estimates go as high as 10,000.
*31:39.040- 31:42.740* :  The dogs form packs, creating a menace for residents.
*31:42.740- 31:47.800* :  Just last month the journalist described how three dogs attacked her in the city centre,
*31:48.280- 31:50.380* :  biting all the way through a leather boot.
*31:50.800- 31:55.180* :  It was merely the latest of hundreds of similar incidents over the past 5 years.
*31:55.840- 31:58.460* :  Mayor Pepper Imrama is throwing money at the problem.
*31:58.500- 32:04.500* :  He hopes an offer of 50 euros per dog per month will encourage people to adopt strays.
*32:07.840- 32:10.560* :  It's an economic benefit for those who decide to adopt them.
*32:10.980- 32:15.000* :  At the same time, it helps us to keep these stray dogs off the streets,
*32:15.440- 32:18.580* :  because they make people feel unsafe, especially children.
*32:18.940- 32:22.580* :  But it's also good for the dogs themselves, because they are mistreated.
*32:26.260- 32:30.260* :  The mayor is also spending more than 300,000 euros on efforts to catch,
*32:30.260- 32:34.900* :  sterilise and immunise street dogs, the reshelters to house them ahead of adoption.
*32:34.900- 32:39.660* :  But the programme doesn't satisfy animal rights activists like Elza Ramadani.
*32:39.660- 32:43.960* :  She wants the authorities to tackle uncontrolled breeding and abandonment.
*32:44.140- 32:47.820* :  Control and management needs to focus on the root causes of the problem
*32:47.820- 32:50.320* :  and just the symptoms of the problems, the stray dogs.
