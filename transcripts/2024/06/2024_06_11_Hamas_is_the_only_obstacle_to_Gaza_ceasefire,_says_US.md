*01:20.800- 01:24.040* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.040- 01:30.000* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday 11th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:30.700- 01:36.580* :  The US accuses Hamas of being the only obstacle to a UN-backed American ceasefire proposal for Gaza
*01:37.080- 01:39.360* :  and insists that Israel does back it.
*01:39.960- 01:44.780* :  A day after we went missing, it's been confirmed that a plane carrying Malawi's vice president
*01:44.780- 01:47.760* :  has crashed, killing everyone on board.
*01:50.760- 01:56.100* :  Also in this podcast, how locals in Tanzania are fighting to preserve coral reefs.
*01:56.520- 02:00.920* :  What we have done around them is that we have used natural coral raw as the foundation for
*02:00.920- 02:05.020* :  artificial reefs, and this is this mimics the natural reef foundation.
*02:06.060- 02:09.920* :  And why even global superstars experience ghosting?
*02:15.040- 02:21.080* :  But first, a day after the UN Security Council endorsed a US-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza,
*02:21.080- 02:27.400* :  America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken, has tried to put the onus directly on Hamas's
*02:27.400- 02:33.060* :  leader in Gaza, Yaya Simwa. Speaking after a meeting in Jerusalem with the Israeli Prime Minister,
*02:33.060- 02:38.920* :  he said Benjamin Netanyahu has assured him of his support for the three-phase proposal,
*02:39.440- 02:44.080* :  which when I'm veiled last month by President Biden had been described as an Israeli proposal.
*02:44.740- 02:49.880* :  But there's growing concern that Mr. Netanyahu's assurance can't be relied on given his repeated
*02:49.880- 02:56.720* :  insistence that Israel won't stop fighting until its eradicated Hamas. Mr. Blinken insisted
*02:56.720- 03:00.780* :  it was not Israel that was the obstacle, but Hamas.
*03:01.860- 03:06.600* :  The United Nations Security Council, in effect speaking for the entire international community,
*03:07.580- 03:11.440* :  made it as clear as it possibly could be that this is what the world is looking for.
*03:12.060- 03:18.100* :  Fourteen votes for no votes against something quite rare at the Security Council these days,
*03:18.140- 03:24.500* :  and I think that speaks volumes too. So, everyone's vote is in except for one vote,
*03:25.500- 03:28.860* :  and that's Hamas, and that's what we wait for.
*03:30.000- 03:35.340* :  The Milton Group has welcomed the UN Security Council resolution but has not given a formal
*03:35.340- 03:40.120* :  response. Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman is traveling with Mr. Blinken.
*03:40.880- 03:45.580* :  Well, the U.S. Secretary of State has reiterated his call for Hamas to accept
*03:46.380- 03:52.720* :  the ceasefire for hostage release proposal that was outlined 11 days ago now by President Biden.
*03:54.140- 04:00.700* :  He described there being in his words one man hiding 10 stories underground that he said was the
*04:00.700- 04:08.080* :  last outstanding vote to this proposal going through, and he said it offered some hope that
*04:08.080- 04:15.060* :  the United Nations Security Council on Monday night passed a resolution backing this
*04:15.500- 04:22.000* :  particular proposal. But there is still a fundamental issue beneath the surface here,
*04:22.000- 04:26.620* :  and it's not part of the public presentation around this, but concern among the Americans
*04:26.620- 04:33.300* :  about keeping the Israeli leadership on board to the extent that it is. That's because Prime Minister
*04:33.300- 04:39.780* :  Netanyahu has been very lukewarm in his public pronouncements about this ceasefire.
*04:40.600- 04:46.520* :  Now, Mr. Blinken was asked today how he had an explicit assurance from Mr. Netanyahu
*04:47.180- 04:52.900* :  that he would continue support for this ceasefire proposal in the event that Hamas comes back
*04:52.900- 04:59.760* :  and accepts it, and Mr. Blinken said him emphatically yes that he had that assurance
*04:59.900- 05:06.780* :  from the Israeli leader. So I think the Americans feel like they're still momentum in this,
*05:06.840- 05:12.800* :  but it remains a fact as Mr. Blinken heads for these meetings with Arab leaders and to Qatar
*05:12.800- 05:18.260* :  on Wednesday it remains the case there is still no real sign of an imminent breakthrough
*05:18.260- 05:24.620* :  in this ceasefire proposal. Tom Beatman meanwhile the Israeli military says four soldiers have been
*05:24.620- 05:29.620* :  killed in Raffa in southern Gaza. The statement said they died when a building rigged with
*05:29.620- 05:35.300* :  explosives collapsed. Yolanda Nell in Jerusalem told us more about the latest fighting in Gaza.
*05:35.980- 05:41.480* :  So if you look at what's been happening in the past day we've seen more Israeli strikes with
*05:41.480- 05:47.720* :  sources in hospitals saying that several Palestinians have been killed in the center of the
*05:47.720- 05:55.160* :  Gaza Strip where Israel began. It's a new military offensive last week. There's been helicopter
*05:55.160- 05:59.940* :  gunfire and naval shelling in the north of Gaza and in the center and we're hearing about
*05:59.940- 06:06.940* :  street battles going on still between Hamas fighters who also leaving sort of booby trap buildings
*06:06.940- 06:14.200* :  in places like Raffa where Israel's military offensive continues. People there the few remaining
*06:14.200- 06:19.500* :  in Raffa because really more than a million have fled from that southernmost city and that's where
*06:19.820- 06:25.180* :  most of the displaced people of Gaza were just a few weeks ago and that is where these four
*06:25.180- 06:31.600* :  Israeli soldiers have been killed were told. I'm at least correspondent Yolanda Nell. More than 24
*06:31.600- 06:36.380* :  hours after a plane carrying the Vice President of Malawi and nine other people went missing while
*06:36.380- 06:40.880* :  flying over the mountainous forests in the north of the country it's been confirmed that all
*06:40.880- 06:47.100* :  on board have died in a crash. The Vice President Salus Shilima had been leading a delegation that
*06:47.100- 06:52.860* :  was due to attend a funeral. In a televised address to the nation Malawi's President Lazarus
*06:52.860- 07:00.280* :  Jaguera said wreckage had been found in a forest. The search and rescue team has found the aircraft
*07:00.280- 07:07.220* :  and they have found it completely destroyed with no survivors as all passengers on board were killed
*07:07.420- 07:16.240* :  on impact. Words cannot describe how heartbreaking this is and I can only imagine how much pain and
*07:16.240- 07:23.160* :  anguish you all must be feeling at this time. Our African regional editor Will Ross told us more.
*07:23.480- 07:30.100* :  Footage from the scene shows the sides of a fairly mountainous area close to forests
*07:30.720- 07:36.680* :  extremely foggy and that seems to have been the problem here. The search did take a long time
*07:36.680- 07:42.000* :  until it found the plane because of the fog and also the fact that it was quite a forested area
*07:42.000- 07:47.140* :  and we now understand that Mr. Shilima's remains and the remains of the other nine passengers
*07:47.140- 07:53.460* :  are going to be taken to the capital Le Longway and Malawi is waiting to hear news of a funeral
*07:53.460- 08:00.840* :  but as you could hear from the President Lazarus Jaguera's voice there you know he was in a very
*08:00.840- 08:06.880* :  somber mood and then there was footage of him consoling other politicians some of whom were wiping
*08:06.920- 08:11.900* :  away tears as he was moving past them but a great deal of shock in Malawi.
*08:12.140- 08:17.800* :  And tell us more about Mr. Shilima I think he had been seen as a future President potentially.
*08:18.220- 08:25.660* :  Well it was reported that he was likely to run for President next year against Mr. Jaguera.
*08:25.660- 08:31.980* :  Interestingly he used to work in the private sector for various businesses and then after
*08:31.980- 08:37.460* :  entering politics he twice served as Vice President and it was actually the teaming up
*08:37.500- 08:44.280* :  between his party and the current President's party that led to the ousting of the former President
*08:44.280- 08:50.780* :  but then corruption allegation surfaced and Mr. Shilima who denied any wrong doing throughout
*08:50.860- 08:58.020* :  was at the centre of a very long corruption allegation that was recently dropped and now we're
*08:58.020- 09:03.620* :  expecting to hear news of a funeral. Will Ross at the latest international donor conference
*09:03.620- 09:08.960* :  to rebuild Ukraine the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has promised to support Kiev for as long
*09:08.960- 09:14.260* :  as necessary. Mr. Schultz told the audience in Berlin which included President Zelensky
*09:14.260- 09:20.020* :  that everything possible needed to be done to boost Ukraine's air defenses and that the war
*09:20.020- 09:27.760* :  would only end with Kiev's victory. What Ukraine's military most urgently needs are
*09:27.760- 09:33.880* :  ammunition and weapons especially air defense and I would like to urge everyone here today
*09:34.480- 09:39.640* :  to support our initiative to strengthen the Ukrainian air defense with everything.
*09:42.180- 09:47.040* :  Mr. Schultz also rallied private companies to put their money into rebuilding Ukraine.
*09:47.100- 09:51.640* :  Our Berlin correspondent Damien McGinnis told us more about the delegates' response.
*09:52.340- 09:57.080* :  The challenge is really how do you rebuild a country when it's still being destroyed by
*09:57.080- 10:02.080* :  Russian attacks and that is really one of the main questions you know overhanging this conference.
*10:02.680- 10:07.540* :  I think there are a couple of different strands of attack here if you like. On the one hand it's
*10:07.540- 10:14.960* :  about restoring straight away where possible the infrastructure for humanitarian survival and so
*10:14.960- 10:20.480* :  you're talking about restoring energy infrastructure that's been destroyed or making sure people
*10:20.480- 10:25.500* :  have clean water. You know really basic stuff that is making life very difficult for Ukrainians
*10:26.040- 10:30.900* :  and then of course you have other form of their infrastructure such as schools and internet and
*10:30.900- 10:35.420* :  all the things that you need to make sure the economy keeps going but there's a broader question
*10:35.460- 10:40.740* :  about what to do later and I think what the conference model the donors and what all the government
*10:40.740- 10:45.540* :  heads and leaders here are saying is that it's really important to get business involved so what
*10:45.540- 10:51.300* :  this really is about it's sort of like a platform for leaders to profile themselves and say
*10:51.680- 10:55.700* :  our country's giving so and so many billions in our country's doing this and to say how much
*10:55.700- 10:59.580* :  they're doing support Ukraine but the real point of this conference is to say to business leaders
*10:59.580- 11:03.440* :  no we are supporting Ukraine politically now this is a good business opportunity for you for the
*11:03.440- 11:08.840* :  future and we need you to invest in Ukraine to have faith in Ukraine to get the economy going
*11:09.360- 11:15.560* :  after the war's finished and Germany is the second biggest supplier of military help after the
*11:15.560- 11:21.220* :  U.S. to Ukraine this appeal for air defense this is going to be music to Mr Zelenskiy's ears
*11:21.540- 11:26.240* :  yeah and I think what we've seen is a remarkable turnaround in Germany until Russia's full
*11:26.240- 11:31.160* :  invasion of Ukraine the whole of German foreign policy and energy policy was essentially based on
*11:31.160- 11:36.240* :  engaging Russia getting energy from Russia and trade with Russia was meant to keep Russia on
*11:36.240- 11:41.380* :  side with the full invasion of Ukraine the governments are a complete turnaround the problem is or
*11:41.380- 11:46.980* :  the difficulty is getting all voters on side because a lot of voters are very uncomfortable with
*11:46.980- 11:52.300* :  what they would see as a big militarization of society a lot of services in Germany are
*11:52.440- 11:57.660* :  increasingly strapped for cash so you know there's a lot of wrangling about budgets here and so
*11:57.660- 12:01.560* :  some people are saying well you know why are we spending so much money on arms when we can't even
*12:02.020- 12:07.760* :  keep schools open properly so that is a debate domestically but I think the political mainstream and
*12:07.760- 12:13.640* :  the most centrist voters and most mainstream voters do wholeheartedly support Ukraine but it is
*12:13.640- 12:18.000* :  about keeping that support on side and it's a big election issue you know we've got federal elections
*12:18.000- 12:23.840* :  next year we just had the European Union Parliament elections and this question of what to do about
*12:23.840- 12:28.360* :  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a live election issue for voters here it's a controversial one
*12:28.720- 12:33.940* :  and it is something that certainly the far right AFD is tapping into saying well you know we're
*12:33.940- 12:39.220* :  just fueling this war and we should buy Russian energy again so it's a controversial issue but one
*12:39.260- 12:43.700* :  that's really I think it's fair to say that mainstream parties and voters are still full on behind
*12:43.700- 12:49.920* :  supporting Ukraine. Damian McGinnis in Berlin three weeks ago a man died and dozens of other
*12:49.920- 12:54.900* :  passengers were injured when a Singapore Airlines plane hit turbulence and dropped more than
*12:54.900- 13:02.700* :  50 meters in just four seconds now the airline has offered compensation of $10,000 to each passenger
*13:02.700- 13:08.780* :  who suffered minor injuries those who were more seriously hurt have been offered an initial
*13:08.780- 13:14.740* :  payment of more than double that sum as Nick Marsh reports. Singapore Airlines hasn't yet
*13:14.740- 13:21.400* :  responded to the BBC's inquiry about exactly how many people will be entitled to the $10,000
*13:21.820- 13:26.420* :  but more than a hundred people were treated in hospital after the flight was safely
*13:26.420- 13:32.500* :  diverted to Bangkok last month the airline says that those passengers who suffered more serious
*13:32.500- 13:39.520* :  injuries have been offered an advanced payment of $25,000 with a view to a personally negotiated
*13:39.520- 13:46.020* :  settlement. Nick Marsh judges from Britain Canada and Australia have continued to sit on Hong
*13:46.020- 13:53.140* :  Kong's top court since the handover to China in 1997 but in the last few days Jonathan Sumpchon
*13:53.140- 13:58.260* :  a former British Supreme Court justice has stepped down from the role along with a colleague it was
*13:58.260- 14:05.580* :  in the wake of the conviction of 14 pro-democracy activists since 2020 Hong Kong has seen a crack
*14:05.580- 14:11.560* :  down on those who support democracy as a sweeping national security law has come into force
*14:11.580- 14:17.080* :  in response to mass protests. The judge told the BBC that the rule of law in Hong Kong
*14:17.080- 14:24.280* :  had been profoundly compromised by China. I think that the picture is getting darker.
*14:25.340- 14:32.820* :  The judgement on the 30th of May against the 14 democracy activists was a major indication
*14:32.940- 14:41.280* :  of the lengths to which some judges are prepared to go to ensure that Beijing's campaign
*14:42.060- 14:47.320* :  against those who have supported democracy succeeds. Well that's provoked this strong response
*14:47.320- 14:54.900* :  from the Chinese territories chief executive John Lee. In 2021, Lord Sumpchon refused to take part
*14:54.900- 15:02.380* :  in a political boycott, orchestrated in the UK, and it said then that people should not confuse
*15:02.540- 15:11.100* :  rule of law with democracy. His reason statement lost to me to be contradictory to his previous
*15:11.880- 15:17.860* :  stands in this regard. I spoke to our Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristo who began by explaining
*15:17.860- 15:23.880* :  why a British judge was in Hong Kong in the first place. It seems odd doesn't it but essentially
*15:23.880- 15:29.720* :  it's a hangover film when Hong Kong was a British colony Hong Kong's legal system is based on
*15:29.720- 15:35.720* :  the British system the common law system and judges from common law jurisdictions Britain,
*15:36.340- 15:41.320* :  Australia and Canada used to sit on Hong Kong courts and indeed he still do on the Hong Kong
*15:41.320- 15:47.460* :  court of final appeal. There are seven judges from abroad who sit on that court still. So that's
*15:47.460- 15:51.940* :  what they're doing there. Also it's because Hong Kong is an international city and it gave
*15:51.940- 15:57.960* :  the place an international flavour. What Lord Sumpchon has said and what you heard him say there was
*15:58.880- 16:04.460* :  essentially over the last few years the situation facing judges and the legal system in Hong Kong
*16:04.460- 16:10.780* :  has completely changed a lot more political pressure on them and so that's why he decided last week
*16:10.780- 16:16.840* :  he could no longer lend his name and his esteem to that system and resigned as other foreign
*16:16.840- 16:22.320* :  judges have done also. And not surprisingly the Chinese response has been quite sharp. It has
*16:22.320- 16:27.360* :  been quite sharp. You heard there John Lee the leader of Hong Kong essentially rebutting
*16:27.360- 16:33.580* :  Jonathan Sumpchon's position. Essentially Mr Lee believes that the Hong Kong legal system remains
*16:33.580- 16:40.300* :  completely independent and outside of political interference. That's stretching things quite a
*16:40.300- 16:45.960* :  lot. I think on the broader point that Jonathan Sumpchon made that the major changes in Hong Kong
*16:46.000- 16:52.200* :  and Jonathan Sumpchon said that actually the territory is moving towards totalitarianism
*16:52.200- 16:56.760* :  and that's because lots of evidence to back that up over the last five years because of the
*16:56.760- 17:01.080* :  introduction of the national security law. People just haven't been able to speak as freely as
*17:01.080- 17:07.460* :  before. Also on a narrower point where the judiciary is being interfered with I think there's a
*17:07.460- 17:12.540* :  lot of evidence to suggest that as well as Lord Sumpchon says judges in Hong Kong have nowhere else
*17:12.560- 17:17.440* :  to go and they come under a lot of pressure from the media, from Chinese politicians to deliver
*17:17.440- 17:23.800* :  verdicts that the Chinese leaders want. So it's a lot of evidence to back up what Jonathan Sumpchon
*17:23.800- 17:32.460* :  has been saying. Mickey Bristol. Still to come on this podcast elephants can remember the sound

*18:49.920- 18:55.640* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast. About one million Rohingya refugees have fled
*18:55.640- 19:01.340* :  persecution in Myanmar to seek refuge across the border in Bangladesh. They've been living in
*19:01.340- 19:06.620* :  crowded camps there for years. Many of them injured or deeply traumatized by the Burmese
*19:06.620- 19:12.480* :  military's campaign of violence against them. But now they also face problems from within.
*19:13.060- 19:17.820* :  Tensions between rival groups in the camps have been rising. And Bangladesh police say following
*19:17.820- 19:23.760* :  a clash in one refugee centre at least three Rohingya refugees have been killed and seven others injured.
*19:23.820- 19:27.640* :  A South Asia region where it's an umbrella in Iran, told us more.
*19:28.060- 19:33.880* :  The security situation inside these Rohingya camps has been worsening in the past few months
*19:33.880- 19:39.900* :  because of in-fighting, fighting between armed groups from the Rohingya community itself.
*19:40.440- 19:46.120* :  You know, these camps are scattered in the district of Coxsburgs or along the border with the Myanmar.
*19:46.840- 19:53.180* :  In fact, the Bangladesh police, they do not go inside late in the nights or even in small numbers
*19:53.180- 19:58.020* :  because of the worsening security. Now, according to the Bangladesh police, more than a hundred
*19:58.020- 20:03.500* :  members of the Arakhan Rohingya Salvation Army people, they broke through the fence and they
*20:03.500- 20:08.780* :  attacked those. We were patrolling the camps in the night. And as a result, three people were killed
*20:08.780- 20:15.180* :  and seven others were injured. Now, this also highlights how bad the situation is for many people
*20:15.180- 20:20.960* :  described that as a, this is really like hell because we escaped from the alleged atrocities
*20:20.960- 20:27.280* :  of the Burmese military. Now, we are being killed by our own people. And it also is linked to the
*20:27.280- 20:32.600* :  situation, what's happening in Myanmar. And that is one of the reasons why the violence is also
*20:32.600- 20:39.140* :  increasing here. Because some of these Rohingya are being forcibly recruited to fight in that civil war
*20:40.420- 20:45.860* :  in Myanmar. In Myanmar, the armed groups opposed to the military regime there. They have been fighting,
*20:45.900- 20:50.620* :  they have been taking over many of the border posts along the Bangladesh Myanmar border.
*20:51.280- 20:55.840* :  Arakhan Rohingya rebels feel that this is the time for them to launch their own attacks against
*20:55.840- 21:00.260* :  the Burmese military because the Burmese military has lost control in some of the Rohingya
*21:00.700- 21:05.760* :  areas on the other side of the border. So what some of the residents are saying is that they come
*21:05.760- 21:13.040* :  here forcefully take teenage boys and men. And they also, you know, induce them with by money,
*21:13.040- 21:18.060* :  they come in the night. And there are fears that more than thousand people possibly could have been
*21:18.060- 21:23.040* :  recruited from these camps. And that is why many parents are trying to protect their sons and
*21:23.040- 21:27.500* :  they borrow money from various agencies from the relatives so that they can at least go abroad.
*21:28.000- 21:30.520* :  And that is the situation they are facing at the moment.
*21:31.540- 21:36.520* :  Umbra Sun Escharajan. There are only three days left until the new South African Parliament
*21:36.520- 21:42.360* :  meets to elect the next president with the governing African National Congress failing to secure
*21:42.360- 21:47.280* :  an outright majority for the first time since democracy was established 30 years ago.
*21:47.820- 21:52.180* :  South Africans are waiting to see if their parliament can produce a coalition government.
*21:52.840- 21:57.900* :  But apart from tricky negotiations, there's also the problem of the recently formed MK party
*21:57.900- 22:02.800* :  of the former president, Jacob Zuma, which doesn't want the session to go ahead at all.
*22:03.260- 22:08.460* :  Our correspondent in Johannesburg, Nomsemaseko, told Victoria Uwankunda more about that.
*22:09.180- 22:15.260* :  The MK party led by the former president, Jacob Zuma, have said that they plan to
*22:15.320- 22:21.460* :  interdict parliament to ensure that Friday's sitting does not take place. And political analysts
*22:21.460- 22:28.000* :  have said that only the constitutional court can do that. However, the Chief Justice of South Africa
*22:28.000- 22:33.920* :  Ray Mondezondo has said that the sitting in parliament will take place on Friday where the
*22:33.920- 22:39.540* :  speaker of parliament will be elected as well as the deputy president and the president.
*22:39.540- 22:45.340* :  However, this is the first time that the A&C does not have a majority in parliament where they
*22:45.340- 22:50.980* :  do not need the support of opposition parties to elect Serra Ramaposa as president.
*22:50.980- 22:57.720* :  So these secret behind closed-door meetings are probably going to help the A&C to ensure
*22:58.200- 23:01.100* :  that Serra Ramaposa is elected president on Friday.
*23:01.640- 23:06.600* :  So what then are we looking in terms of scenario? We're looking at MK's MPs not showing up on
*23:06.600- 23:13.280* :  Friday. They're very first day being in parliament. Well, Uwankunda's MPs have said that they
*23:13.280- 23:18.660* :  will not go to parliament to sit and elect a president because they believe that the elections
*23:18.660- 23:24.780* :  were a sham that does not represent the will of the people. However, the MK has also not come
*23:24.780- 23:30.240* :  forward with evidence of vote rigging as they had said that they will take it to court
*23:30.240- 23:35.660* :  to ensure that parliament does not sit. So South Africans want to know what is it that
*23:35.660- 23:43.180* :  MK has? What kind of evidence do they have to prove that the election was fraud? And as a result,
*23:43.180- 23:48.460* :  it looks like the majority of political parties, particularly those that have been elected,
*23:49.020- 23:53.800* :  will go to parliament on Friday and there will be that election of the speaker, the deputy,
*23:53.800- 24:00.240* :  and the president. So what is the best scenario here for Serra Ramaposa, the president and A&C
*24:00.240- 24:06.220* :  in terms of forging ahead, who are we looking at, or with them making a deal of coalition with?
*24:06.580- 24:13.840* :  The A&C has proposed a government of national unity where it has been trying to invite all kinds
*24:13.840- 24:19.860* :  of political parties, all of them that are represented in parliament. There have been a lot of
*24:19.860- 24:27.760* :  behind closed door meetings told that negotiations are at a very sensitive stage because they also
*24:27.760- 24:34.300* :  include the sharing of cabinet positions. At the same time, not everyone in the A&C has agreed
*24:34.300- 24:39.380* :  that the former Liberation Movement form a partnership with the Democratic Alliance,
*24:39.380- 24:47.240* :  because some A&C insiders believe a partnership with the DA would be seen as a betrayal to its supporters
*24:47.840- 24:52.200* :  and as a result, the internal dissent is intensifying.
*24:52.880- 24:59.920* :  Norsamaseco is South Africa. Now humans like talking to friends and family, but we're not alone.
*25:04.460- 25:10.860* :  Vash is a sound of an elephant. It may seem to be just low rumbling, but scientists in Kenya say
*25:10.860- 25:15.820* :  they've discovered that wild elephants call their family and other members of the herd that they're
*25:15.820- 25:22.800* :  close to by specific names and respond enthusiastically when they're called by another elephant they
*25:22.800- 25:30.400* :  know well. Francis Reed reports. In Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya, scientists studied
*25:30.400- 25:36.860* :  herds of wild elephants. They found the noises the animals made included a range of complex
*25:36.860- 25:43.080* :  information, not just emotion, but also names for each other. Mickey Pardo led the research.
*25:43.840- 25:47.900* :  They're called rumbles and you know when most people think of elephant calls, they probably think
*25:47.900- 25:53.780* :  of trumpets, which are sort of the iconic sound the elephants make, but actually trumpets are
*25:53.780- 25:58.520* :  much less common than rumbles. One of the interesting things about these calls is they're so low
*25:58.520- 26:04.520* :  frequency that most speakers can't reproduce them because the human ear can't detect all of it.
*26:04.880- 26:11.480* :  It sounds kind of something like it's just this rumbling low-pitched vocalization.
*26:11.900- 26:16.600* :  When the scientists played to an elephant, a recording of their friend or family member
*26:16.600- 26:22.540* :  calling out their name, the animal called back or approached the speaker, but the same elephant
*26:22.540- 26:28.420* :  was far less enthusiastic when played the names of others. The researchers say that when names were
*26:28.420- 26:34.300* :  called out, it was often adults addressing young elephants over a long distance. And by using
*26:34.300- 26:39.340* :  machine learning, the researchers were able to decipher the patterns in the animals calls.
*26:39.880- 26:43.700* :  There's been kind of a proliferation of interest recently in using machine learning
*26:43.700- 26:48.680* :  to help us understand animal communication. Using it to try to figure out if animals have names
*26:48.680- 26:54.480* :  for each other is kind of a unknowable application of it, I think. Parrots and dolphins are already
*26:54.480- 27:00.300* :  known to identify each other by mimicking each other's calls. And some species of bats can use
*27:00.300- 27:06.840* :  specific calls to others, but elephants are the first non-human species found to use names that
*27:06.840- 27:12.760* :  can be understood. Scientists say the research could have significant implications for our
*27:12.760- 27:18.540* :  understanding of the way elephants think and the social bonds they form. It gives a new meaning
*27:18.540- 27:24.880* :  to the phrase trunk call that report by Francis Reed. Two towns in here now and the coral reef
*27:24.880- 27:30.340* :  surrounding Member Island in the Zanzibar Archipelago is under threat from warmer sea temperatures,
*27:30.340- 27:36.180* :  illegal fishing and damage from tourism. Now locals have come up with an ingenious
*27:36.180- 27:42.520* :  solution to preserve both the reef and their own livelihoods. Alfred Lastic reports from Zanzibar.
*27:46.180- 27:51.460* :  In Member Island, a hidden oasis of the North East Coast of Zanzibar
*27:51.920- 27:55.660* :  several ocean rangers dive deep into the sapphire waters.
*28:00.160- 28:06.220* :  The divers are part of a team to restore the island's famous coral reef known as one of the
*28:06.220- 28:13.920* :  most important nature reserves in East Africa. Over the years, the coral reef has reduced its
*28:13.920- 28:23.620* :  cover by 55%. Initially, the area faced significant pressure from tourism. Bacarija is the
*28:23.620- 28:32.220* :  coordinator of African Foundation Zanzibar. With 200 boats carrying at least 400 guests
*28:32.440- 28:40.940* :  entering an area of only 200 square meters simultaneously. In September 2021,
*28:41.700- 28:48.640* :  local communities began collaborating with and beyond a non-profit responsible tourism organization
*28:48.640- 28:54.860* :  and African Foundation to repair the reef, protect the marine conservation area and support
*28:54.860- 29:02.160* :  sustainable fishing. We have witnessed corals regenerating. Even at significant depth,
*29:02.160- 29:11.660* :  we have successful restored damaged corals by 80%. Members' coral reef has been damaged in part
*29:12.000- 29:18.220* :  due to warmer temperatures which cause the corals to expand the algae that gives them the color
*29:18.220- 29:24.500* :  stunning them white, also known as coral bleaching. At fisheries, as seen as one way to counter
*29:24.500- 29:30.260* :  this, but using the right material is vital to their success. When artificial reefs were in the
*29:30.260- 29:36.460* :  infancy, people used the wrong materials that dumping tyres to try and create artificial reefs
*29:36.460- 29:42.440* :  which is not the right approach. Dr Camila Flores is the program manager and principal scientist
*29:42.440- 29:47.020* :  at Oceans Without Borders, who has been working on the project in member.
*30:00.880- 30:06.060* :  The project is also educating the local community on how to protect the coral reefs.
*30:06.460- 30:10.480* :  Unfulfishing practices in the past contributed to the reef damage.
*30:17.420- 30:22.080* :  We have seen positive changes. Illegal practices like the use of bombs have decreased
*30:22.500- 30:26.240* :  and the fishermen have become more knowledgeable about sustainable fishing methods.
*30:31.580- 30:38.740* :  The coral reef is also crucial to Zanzibar's local economy. Dr Makame Omar is the Director of Zanzibar
*30:38.740- 30:45.300* :  Marine Department. Coral has got very important position to play in the development of a blue
*30:45.300- 30:53.420* :  economy. Currently, we managed to demarcate 14 coral-rich areas in both Pember and the
*30:53.420- 31:03.540* :  Anguja. Out of 14, up to this moment, we managed to put the location boys for seven out of 14
*31:04.300- 31:10.780* :  and the increase awareness to fishermen that these areas are now a replenished zone.
*31:11.340- 31:18.520* :  No fishing activities allowed to give chance for the coral to rejuvenate to replenish.
*31:21.660- 31:28.360* :  But in the first of relentless climate change, the long-term viability of artificial reef is uncertain.
*31:32.300- 31:38.720* :  Some argue that to really protect the coral, mitigating climate change is the only long-term solution.
*31:43.000- 31:45.200* :  Alfred Lastic in Zanzibar
*31:46.400- 31:52.660* :  No one likes to be rejected or in modern parlance ghosted. That's when someone very close to you,
*31:52.740- 31:58.880* :  a lover, a family member or a friend, cuts off all communication without any explanation.
*31:59.640- 32:03.840* :  Sometimes when you thought you were getting on well with each other, and in the age of dating
*32:03.840- 32:10.420* :  apps and social media, this kind of practice is becoming increasingly common. So much so that not
*32:10.420- 32:15.720* :  even global superstars are immune from it, this report by Alfie Habeson.
*32:24.100- 32:28.780* :  That's the American singer Billie Eilish. She's got nine Grammy Awards, multiple number one hits
*32:28.780- 32:35.360* :  and millions of delirious fans who call themselves the avocados, but she's not safe from a ghosting.
*32:35.800- 32:40.900* :  So then who is? Almost one third of Americans say they've been victim to that stinging feeling,
*32:41.480- 32:45.440* :  and we always think it's personal, it's surely to do with the fact that there is something
*32:45.440- 32:49.580* :  terrible about you that no one is willing to share with you, or that your lover is suddenly
*32:49.580- 32:55.140* :  fallen in love with someone else, they just walk past in the street. But experts say it's really
*32:55.140- 33:00.380* :  not to do with you at all, and that it's the new normal in dating, brought on by the social
*33:00.380- 33:05.420* :  isolation people have experienced during COVID. But are they just trying to make us feel better
*33:05.420- 33:10.700* :  about being rejected? Here's an explanation from someone who's actually dished out at dreaded
*33:10.820- 33:16.120* :  ghosting. I know people demonise us, but we're not bad people. I don't think, I think the majority
*33:16.120- 33:21.500* :  of people that ghosts don't do it are malicious intent. I think it's because, well, in my case,
*33:21.540- 33:26.040* :  anyway, it's just cowardice. We're scared. Scared to have a real connection with someone.
*33:26.880- 33:30.900* :  I've missed that one so many potential friendships, like love interests. I've even
*33:30.900- 33:36.900* :  guess it's family members simply because of cowardice. But surely it's not always so dramatic.
*33:36.900- 33:41.440* :  Don't we just sometimes forget to address them, never ending stream of messages and emails
*33:41.440- 33:47.220* :  that we are confronted with every day? Well, that's my excuse anyway, and anything that brings a
*33:47.220- 33:51.900* :  millionaire superstar back down to earth might not be a bad thing. Alfie Habeson.
