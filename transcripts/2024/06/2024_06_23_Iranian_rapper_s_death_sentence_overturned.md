*01:22.780- 01:29.120* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, and this edition is published in the early hours of Sunday
*01:29.120- 01:34.500* :  the 23rd of June, less than a week before Iran's presidential election, the Supreme Court
*01:34.500- 01:37.520* :  overturns a death sentence given to a popular rapper.
*01:38.480- 01:43.760* :  Hamas says Israeli airstrikes on residential areas in northern Gaza killed 38 people.
*01:43.760- 01:45.960* :  Israel says it was targeting Hamas.
*01:46.600- 01:51.400* :  And Greek police arrest 13 people in connection with a wildfire thought would have been caused
*01:51.400- 01:53.220* :  by fireworks from a yacht.
*02:05.380- 02:05.460* :  Also in the podcast,
*02:05.460- 02:07.600* :  crowning the world's ugliest dog.
*02:12.860- 02:18.680* :  But first, too much Salehi is an Iranian rapper known for his songs about social issues
*02:30.120- 02:30.180* :  and government policies.
*02:30.180- 02:32.940* :  Two months ago, he was sentenced to death.
*02:33.340- 02:37.740* :  He had angered the clerical regime by backing the protests over the death in police custody
*02:37.740- 02:38.960* :  of Masa Aminni.
*02:39.420- 02:44.200* :  But with the Iranian presidential election now less than a week away, the Supreme Court
*02:44.200- 02:47.820* :  there has overturned the sentence and ordered a retrial.
*02:48.180- 02:52.840* :  I had more about too much Salehi from Kasra Naji of the BBC Persian Service.
*02:53.460- 02:58.440* :  He supported the wave of protests in Iran in 2022.
*02:59.040- 03:04.220* :  The protests that came under the title of a woman, a life freedom.
*03:04.880- 03:11.840* :  And he vocally and loudly supported that he joined the protests and he started singing
*03:11.840- 03:18.720* :  these very political protest songs in support of that movement and also in support of fight
*03:18.720- 03:23.700* :  against inequalities about injustice, about suppression of women.
*03:24.180- 03:27.220* :  He was very vocal and very political about that.
*03:27.600- 03:30.920* :  Obviously, the Iranian authorities didn't like that.
*03:31.400- 03:35.900* :  It's all those things that Iranian clerics despise.
*03:36.480- 03:44.380* :  And it happened at a time of very sensitive time in Iran and huge amount of protests in Iran.
*03:44.860- 03:48.560* :  So they raided his house and they arrested him.
*03:49.060- 03:56.700* :  Soon after, there was a video on one of the pro-government websites that showed him having
*03:56.700- 04:04.220* :  been beaten in a dark corner on the floor with blindfold on and saying things that wasn't
*04:04.220- 04:10.200* :  very clear, but according to those websites, he was confessing that he had done something
*04:10.200- 04:10.520* :  wrong.
*04:11.020- 04:15.280* :  Now, Iran is not scared of executing its prisoners.
*04:15.940- 04:22.020* :  Why do you think they've moved now to overturn the death sentence and order a retrial?
*04:22.220- 04:23.400* :  We don't know, basically.
*04:23.700- 04:25.740* :  The timing is interesting.
*04:26.740- 04:31.220* :  Just six days away from Iran's presidential elections.
*04:31.860- 04:38.380* :  Maybe they thought by commuting that sentence for the time being, they can entice more people
*04:38.380- 04:45.180* :  to come to the polls because there's widespread discontent in Iran and there are many people
*04:45.180- 04:49.220* :  who say they don't want to go and vote and they're boycotting the elections.
*04:49.880- 04:54.900* :  So it would help maybe to entice more people to come and vote.
*04:55.420- 05:01.320* :  But also, maybe they decided that if they were going to execute this man, there could
*05:01.320- 05:05.400* :  be a backlash at the time of elections, not a good idea.
*05:05.720- 05:10.920* :  But do you think in the retrial, he'll be found guilty again and face execution later?
*05:11.180- 05:18.140* :  I don't know because, and Iranian judiciary is very unpredictable what they do and what
*05:18.140- 05:20.320* :  they do is very political too.
*05:20.700- 05:27.180* :  It depends on the political situation, on the day, on the week, on the year and which
*05:27.180- 05:33.520* :  forces are on top at the time in Iran and in Iran's judiciary, so we just have to wait
*05:33.520- 05:33.860* :  and see.
*05:34.420- 05:36.440* :  Casra Najee of the BBC Persian Service.
*05:37.200- 05:41.520* :  The EU Foreign Affairs Chief Joseph Barrel has called for an independent investigation
*05:41.580- 05:47.700* :  after at least 22 people died in explosions near the Red Cross office in Gaza on Friday.
*05:48.340- 05:53.180* :  Israel is reviewing the incident but says there's no indication that it carried out a strike
*05:53.180- 05:53.480* :  there.
*05:53.980- 05:59.200* :  Sean Berghead of the ICRC delegation in Gaza spoke to the BBC from the scene.
*05:59.720- 06:03.240* :  I'm running out of adjectives to describe just how painful it was.
*06:03.700- 06:08.220* :  There were several extremely loud explosions, very close to where we are located.
*06:08.280- 06:14.400* :  We are talking really just a few meters away from us, several dead and wounded directly
*06:14.400- 06:20.600* :  in front of our office, which was also partially damaged by the impact of these blasts, going
*06:20.600- 06:26.180* :  on nine months of war, it's an extremely difficult situation for anybody to process.
*06:26.680- 06:32.380* :  I think particularly for our Palestinian colleagues and civilians within Gaza who have borne
*06:32.380- 06:38.120* :  the brunt of this conflict, the burden of this conflict is too great for too many.
*06:38.660- 06:40.520* :  William Schomburg of the Red Cross.
*06:40.520- 06:46.160* :  Well, the day after that incident in the southern coastal area of Al-Mawasi, more Palestinians
*06:46.160- 06:48.280* :  were killed in northern Gaza.
*06:48.940- 06:53.940* :  Hamas has at least 38 people died in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City on Saturday.
*06:53.940- 06:59.580* :  Israel said it hit two Hamas sites there, video shows plumes of smoke and flattened buildings
*06:59.580- 07:01.660* :  in the Al-Shati refugee camp.
*07:02.260- 07:04.660* :  Hussein Muhaisin is a civil defence spokesman.
*07:07.500- 07:11.860* :  The whole area was targeted, it was like an earthquake, homes were destroyed.
*07:12.620- 07:14.480* :  There are still families under the rubble.
*07:15.460- 07:19.140* :  Some of the injured were transferred to the Baptist hospital, and now we're rescuing
*07:19.140- 07:20.360* :  others from under the rubble.
*07:20.780- 07:25.920* :  The situation is very, very difficult due to the lack of tools and fuel for ambulances.
*07:26.500- 07:29.960* :  I heard more from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda now.
*07:30.420- 07:37.680* :  There have been a number of neighbourhoods hit in Gaza City, most notably the Shati or
*07:37.680- 07:44.300* :  Beach camp, one of the eight urban refugee camps in Gaza, and you can see in some of
*07:44.300- 07:48.100* :  the footage that's being shared on social media, the immediate aftermath.
*07:48.140- 07:54.740* :  These were large strikes, several strikes witnesses said, where there are dozens of people
*07:55.220- 07:57.740* :  rushing out to search for victims in the street.
*07:57.740- 08:03.820* :  You can see a lot of destruction there, homes completely flattened, walls blasted apart,
*08:03.820- 08:10.200* :  a lot of debris filling up the streets, and people rushing some of the wounded away on stretches
*08:10.900- 08:16.380* :  carrying a small boy, his face covered in dust, the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
*08:16.380- 08:21.360* :  There are dozens of wounded as well as those killed with tolls, and there were also these
*08:21.360- 08:26.000* :  strikes that took place in the Tufach neighborhood of Gaza City, where the Israeli
*08:26.000- 08:30.280* :  military has only said that it was targeting Hamas infrastructure.
*08:30.300- 08:34.320* :  It put out quite a brief statement saying that more details would follow later,
*08:34.320- 08:38.860* :  and there's been some speculation in the Israeli media that this was a senior
*08:38.860- 08:45.240* :  commander in Hamas who was being targeted, that the head of the military wing of Hamas in Gaza City
*08:45.240- 08:51.760* :  and attempted to kill him. And really, it's just added to the sense that fighting is picking up
*08:51.760- 08:58.260* :  again in Gaza. We're hearing of other strikes in Al-Shajahir, and in the Zaytun neighborhood,
*08:58.260- 09:02.100* :  these are neighborhoods that have been repeatedly targeted by Israeli forces,
*09:02.620- 09:07.360* :  and where they say they have gone back as they've seen Hamas regrouping.
*09:07.660- 09:13.000* :  You'll land now in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the UN Chief Antonio Guterres has warned that
*09:13.000- 09:19.160* :  escalating tensions on Israel's northern border could trigger a catastrophe and turn Lebanon
*09:19.160- 09:25.360* :  into, quote, another Gaza. All-out conflict has been threatening to erupt there since the Lebanese
*09:25.360- 09:30.560* :  militant group Hezbollah began firing missiles into northern Israel, following the October
*09:30.560- 09:36.620* :  7th massacre, prompting tit-for-tat responses from Israel. Lucy Williamson reports from northern
*09:36.620- 09:46.840* :  Israel. David Kamari's neighbors are long gone. The roofs of their houses smashed by
*09:46.840- 09:53.300* :  shrapnel from Hezbollah rockets. David has stayed on in the largely deserted border town of
*09:53.340- 10:01.560* :  Kiryac Shmona. Even now, weeks after a rocket hit his front garden, cracking his house in several
*10:01.560- 10:08.540* :  places, every day, every night, bomb, problem, and I burn here. What I see?
*10:11.660- 10:13.860* :  Rockets hit Kiryac Shmona every week.
*10:16.440- 10:21.880* :  One slipped past Israel's defenses days ago, hitting a street outside the mayor's office,
*10:21.880- 10:30.480* :  and hit here. The US is pushing hard for a diplomatic solution here,
*10:31.100- 10:36.520* :  but the mayor, Aveh Heistan, says full-scale war, is the only way out.
*10:36.520- 10:43.780* :  Sitting here like lambs to slaughter, just waiting for the day they attack us like we saw in
*10:43.780- 10:50.320* :  the south, it's unacceptable, and everyone understands the choices between the war now or war later.
*10:51.280- 10:55.680* :  I don't think there is any country in the world that would accept daily fire against its citizens.
*11:01.280- 11:06.760* :  Israeli strikes into southern Lebanon have displaced more than 90,000 people on the Lebanese side
*11:06.760- 11:12.940* :  of the border, but some have stayed, saying it's better to die at home with dignity than be driven
*11:12.940- 11:20.820* :  out of their land like the Palestinians. Fear of all-out war extends as far as the capital Beirut,
*11:21.420- 11:27.720* :  where some say they keep suitcases packed and passports ready in case full-scale war breaks out.
*11:30.540- 11:35.560* :  Of course we don't want to go to war with Israel, but if that solidarity with the people and
*11:35.560- 11:45.600* :  Gaza, so be it. I went to the south a few days ago, you wonder if the highway will get hit on the
*11:45.600- 11:55.860* :  way back, but am I going to stop for everything? Life doesn't stop. Of course, everyone is afraid,
*11:56.480- 11:59.220* :  and those who tell you they are not, are lying to themselves.
*12:02.920- 12:07.680* :  Hezbollah is a well-trained, well-armed military, backed by Iran.
*12:11.280- 12:18.020* :  Its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has threatened to invade Israel if full-scale war breaks out and says
*12:18.020- 12:23.280* :  nowhere in the country will be spared. But Israel has been talking up, it's readiness to take
*12:23.280- 12:31.220* :  them on. Tough talk is part of both side strategy of deterrence, but the line between deterrence and
*12:31.220- 12:39.700* :  decision on a war is becoming harder to see. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing
*12:39.700- 12:49.900* :  growing demands at home for a ceasefire in Gaza. That would help calm tensions in the north too,
*12:50.860- 12:57.180* :  but Mr Netanyahu is keeping both conflicts going, moregaged by his promise to far-right government
*12:57.180- 13:04.560* :  allies to destroy Hamas before ending the Gaza war. Playing for time is his specialty,
*13:05.620- 13:10.280* :  but the longer this conflict goes on, the more it turns into playing with fire.
*13:13.100- 13:15.120* :  A report by Lucy Williamson
*13:16.020- 13:22.200* :  Until 1953, Greenland was a colony of Denmark before becoming a formal part of the kingdom,
*13:22.600- 13:27.460* :  but relations have been soured by recent revelations of misconduct on the vast island
*13:27.460- 13:32.860* :  by the Danish authorities in the 20th century. Now, four people who were born in Greenland but
*13:32.860- 13:38.560* :  adopted by Danish parents have claimed that those adoptions were illegal and are seeking compensation,
*13:38.560- 13:43.380* :  more details from Stephanie Zacherson. The four people say that their biological families
*13:43.380- 13:49.180* :  weren't made aware of exactly what was happening to them, be then children when they were adopted
*13:49.180- 13:55.900* :  by Danish families and taken from Greenland. One of them is my eight-year Hanson. She was barely
*13:55.900- 14:02.440* :  six months old when she was adopted in 1951. She says her biological mother didn't understand what
*14:02.440- 14:07.320* :  she was being told, that she only thought her daughter would be receiving foster care for a period
*14:07.320- 14:11.800* :  of time. Instead, my eight-year was moved to Denmark and grew up there.
*14:15.340- 14:22.760* :  When that happened, I was taken from my mother, my family, my language, my culture, my name.
*14:23.780- 14:28.020* :  They took literally everything and sent me away from the life I was supposed to have.
*14:28.220- 14:34.280* :  It took my eight to 40 years to find and reconnect with her birth mother. By then,
*14:34.280- 14:38.780* :  they were not only separated by time, but by speaking different languages.
*14:39.640- 14:44.040* :  After researching her own history and the history of adoptions between Greenland and Denmark,
*14:44.660- 14:49.340* :  Meghaleta says that there was a certain power dynamic where Greenlandic women
*14:49.340- 14:56.000* :  weren't listened to by the Danish authorities. The lawyer Mats Palming has brought this case and
*14:56.000- 15:01.880* :  the demands for compensation to the Danish government. He says there's no doubt that the authorities
*15:01.880- 15:09.720* :  were aware of these adoptions being handled incorrectly. The most basic requirement for an
*15:09.720- 15:13.520* :  adoption is that the people who are giving up their child want to give up their child,
*15:13.520- 15:18.460* :  that there's consent from both families and the state has to make sure that everything's done
*15:18.460- 15:23.680* :  accordingly. But when you look closer at these cases, it's apparent that Danish couples came to
*15:23.680- 15:28.840* :  Greenland with the single purpose of bringing a child home and the authorities seem to have looked
*15:28.840- 15:35.740* :  the other way. The adopted people are each asking for the equivalent of $35,000 in compensation.
*15:35.820- 15:41.660* :  Mats Palming says there are many more people affected and that the number of claimants may well
*15:41.660- 15:49.040* :  grow. The Danish government are yet to comment. But the case is part of an unraveling of the past
*15:49.040- 15:54.780* :  of the history between Greenland and Denmark. The Arctic island was a colony of Denmark,
*15:54.780- 16:00.740* :  with its states as changing several times during the 1900s, gaining more and more autonomy.
*16:01.480- 16:06.040* :  It still has a close relationship with Denmark. The Danish king is its head of state,
*16:06.740- 16:12.460* :  but it has its own government and parliament. During recent years, more and more information about
*16:12.460- 16:17.880* :  what happened during the colonial period has come to light and brought what many in Greenland
*16:17.880- 16:25.200* :  view as wrongdoings by the Danish state into the public domain. Two years ago, the Danish prime minister
*16:25.200- 16:30.920* :  issued a public apology and approved reparations to a group of inuits that had been separated from
*16:30.920- 16:36.660* :  their families in the 1950s, taken from Greenland to go to schools in Denmark in a push to
*16:36.660- 16:43.080* :  increase education levels among Greenlanders. And earlier this year, a group of Greenlander
*16:43.080- 16:49.120* :  indigenous women sued the Danish state. They claimed that they were unknowingly fitted with the
*16:49.120- 16:55.740* :  contraceptive coil in the 1960s, when some of them were only in their teens as parts of a program
*16:55.740- 17:01.620* :  created to control Greenland's birth rate and population growth. Stephanie Zacherson reporting.
*17:04.540- 17:10.640* :  And still to come on the global news podcast? I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew
*17:10.640- 17:15.460* :  the kind of woman I wanted to be. I wanted to be a woman in charge. Yes, I wanted to have a man's
*17:15.460- 17:21.640* :  life, but I still wanted to be a woman. A new documentary about Diane von Furstenberg designer of

*18:30.240- 18:36.100* :  Greek police have arrested 13 people on suspicion of causing a wildfire on the island of Hydra.
*18:36.460- 18:40.480* :  The blaze swept through a forested area near a beach triggering public anger.
*18:40.480- 18:46.020* :  Danny Aberhard reports reports that the fire was caused either by fireworks or flares launched
*18:46.020- 18:51.240* :  by people on a yacht have caused outrage in Greece. The country suffered horrendous deadly
*18:51.240- 18:55.460* :  fires last summer and the authorities have been warning of a very high risk of more,
*18:55.920- 19:01.260* :  indeed some parts of Greece are already seeing them. Heat waves exacerbated by climate change
*19:01.260- 19:06.680* :  are part of the problem, but so too is arson and negligence. In the hydro case,
*19:07.000- 19:11.940* :  members of the public have called for the yacht allegedly involved to be confiscated and those
*19:11.940- 19:18.540* :  responsible jailed. Danny Aberhard. The fire comes as the northern hemisphere continues to bake in
*19:18.540- 19:24.520* :  temperatures that scientists say are made 35 times more likely by global warming. The heat has
*19:24.520- 19:30.060* :  contributed to more than 1,000 deaths during the harsh pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. The US,
*19:30.060- 19:35.460* :  Europe and Central America have also been suffering as we can hear now from some of our correspondents
*19:35.460- 19:41.500* :  starting with Will Vernon in Washington. A third of the country is under a hot weather advisory
*19:41.500- 19:47.480* :  at the moment, over 100 million Americans. Several places had record-breaking temperatures on
*19:47.480- 19:53.380* :  Friday, so that's the highest recorded temperature on the calendar day in question. For example,
*19:53.580- 20:02.040* :  in Connecticut, it was 37 degrees Celsius. It was 46 degrees in Phoenix, Arizona. It feels a lot
*20:02.040- 20:06.940* :  hotter than that. In New York City, a little further north from here, they're also braced
*20:06.940- 20:12.220* :  for the heat there. The National Guard has been activated by the governor. City officials are
*20:12.220- 20:17.840* :  warning people to prepare for potential blackouts, and that's because of the millions of air
*20:17.840- 20:22.680* :  conditioning units fans that could overload the system, and the city has set up what's called
*20:22.680- 20:28.180* :  cooling centers, where people can go and cool down in an air-conditioned area and have some water.
*20:28.760- 20:32.820* :  Will Vernon next to our Balkans correspondent, Guy Delaney, in Slovenia?
*20:33.180- 20:38.320* :  We had a bit of a max moment on Friday across great parts of the western Balkans,
*20:38.560- 20:44.820* :  because at 12.30 in the afternoon, local time, the power went out in Montenegro, Albania,
*20:45.100- 20:51.140* :  the Dalmatian coast of Croatia, and most of Bosnia for about an hour. The traffic was
*20:51.140- 20:55.040* :  in complete chaos because there were no traffic lights. Some people were saying, I've got an
*20:55.040- 21:00.320* :  oxygen supply which isn't working. Can you come and find me? The electricity utilities are saying
*21:00.940- 21:05.740* :  what happened was due to the heat that there was an overload in the system caused by a combination
*21:05.820- 21:10.860* :  of the high temperatures themselves and the high demand for electricity from people who want to
*21:10.860- 21:16.440* :  operate, of course, air conditioning. That demand, that temperature, that was what caused
*21:16.440- 21:22.020* :  they think this chaos yesterday. Guy Delaney. And for the view from Egypt, here's Salina Bill.
*21:22.580- 21:28.880* :  I've never in my entire life, I've never seen a summer as hot as this one. It's reaching 45 and
*21:28.880- 21:36.100* :  46 degrees here. The government has already chopped down a huge number of trees over the past few
*21:36.100- 21:43.480* :  years. Trees that are more than 100 years old. You walk down a main street in Cairo, for example,
*21:43.480- 21:49.780* :  and it just feels like a desert with no green area whatsoever. We are being warned that the
*21:49.780- 21:56.580* :  temperatures will keep rising as we reach July and August. People are thinking what they are
*21:56.580- 22:02.720* :  going to do and how they are going to handle that. Salina Bill in Cairo. So what impact are these
*22:02.720- 22:07.980* :  increasingly regular heatwaves having on governments and their policies on climate change?
*22:08.300- 22:13.920* :  Caroline Wyatt discussed that question with Professor Rachel Kite, who served as advisor to the
*22:13.920- 22:20.440* :  UN Secretary General on Climate Action and to Miles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science and Director
*22:20.440- 22:26.200* :  of the Oxford Net Zero Initiative, first to Miles Allen, are these higher temperatures
*22:26.600- 22:31.060* :  definitely down to climate change? Yeah, I mean, the fact that human-induced greenhouse gas
*22:31.060- 22:35.620* :  emissions, I mean, like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, increases the risk of these
*22:35.620- 22:40.560* :  heatwaves. It is very well established now. I mean, we first published a paper making this link
*22:40.560- 22:45.880* :  20 years ago. So, I mean, the science has really not moved on now. It's not just whether
*22:46.340- 22:50.380* :  human influence on climate is making these heatwaves worse, but how fast?
*22:50.680- 22:56.200* :  Rachel Kite, to what degree is this worrying governments now making them take press action?
*22:56.360- 23:02.480* :  Well, it's an election year across the world and this has not featured in the elections so far.
*23:02.540- 23:08.700* :  You know, famously, India just went to the polls and many Indians were dying in the line for
*23:08.700- 23:14.580* :  the polls, but there was very little discussion around this. We are now seeing pilgrims dying as
*23:14.580- 23:19.360* :  they go to Mecca. Again, very little sort of governmental response, but I think shock from the
*23:19.360- 23:25.020* :  governments whose pilgrims are actually suffering. We don't see this as a feature of the election
*23:25.020- 23:29.720* :  in the United States either, and around the world, this is not featuring at the national level,
*23:30.140- 23:35.980* :  where we are seeing action is at the city level. And we're starting to see unions and workers
*23:37.020- 23:42.080* :  organizations really starting to mobilize as they see the extreme sort of vulnerability of
*23:42.100- 23:46.540* :  their members and of the people that they serve. But Rachel, on that, I mean, does it worry you
*23:46.560- 23:51.040* :  when you do see governments rowing back or slowing down their earlier commitments to reach
*23:51.040- 23:56.640* :  in that zero? Absolutely, because I think the heat has come earlier than people expected. I mean,
*23:56.640- 24:01.440* :  for example, in the UK, the climate change committee said at one point that they saw a very
*24:01.440- 24:08.320* :  little prospect of 40 degree heat before 2040. And of course, we had that in 2022. But then what's
*24:08.320- 24:13.280* :  happening is that the health service union, the fibre brigades, the city leaders are sort of
*24:13.280- 24:19.260* :  organising. And on Thursday of this week, Operation Helios will be a London-wide, an extreme heat
*24:19.260- 24:23.660* :  exercise, which will then help London have an extreme heat plan. And I think city leaders,
*24:23.660- 24:28.380* :  whether it's Anne Hidalgo, has to work out how to manage to keep people safe during the
*24:28.380- 24:35.180* :  Olympics in Paris or the Mayor of London or across the United States from Phoenix to Boston to Miami.
*24:35.180- 24:39.560* :  It's at the city level that action is starting and that's going to have to bubble up to the
*24:39.560- 24:44.200* :  governmental level at some point. Miles Allen, we've talked about governments, but is it your
*24:44.200- 24:49.580* :  impression from conversations you've had that people, voters, the public, are now genuinely
*24:49.580- 24:53.720* :  concerned by climate change and are ready to modify behaviour? Well, I think people are genuinely
*24:53.720- 24:58.660* :  concerned. I think the reason that I think it's so difficult for this to get through to people
*24:58.660- 25:03.160* :  is they also get told that it's going to be incredibly difficult. And so people just feel
*25:03.160- 25:08.020* :  overwhelmed and and caught between a rock and a hard place. The fundamental problem is that we
*25:08.020- 25:13.300* :  don't expect people to dispose of the carbon dioxide associated with the products they sell.
*25:13.520- 25:19.040* :  Until we do that, we're not going to fix the problem. When we do, the problem will get fixed
*25:19.040- 25:23.460* :  remarkably quickly. And Rachel Cahyd, you mentioned elections. It's a
*25:23.460- 25:28.320* :  risk that governments will get so bogged down in day-to-day governance elections over the next
*25:28.320- 25:33.000* :  year or so, that it's very difficult to get minds to focus back on impacts lying perhaps
*25:33.000- 25:40.060* :  a few years ahead. We know from extreme heat that you lose productivity, right? So 20 to 25 percent,
*25:40.640- 25:44.620* :  depending on how much shade you've got, when it gets hot and that's just going to go up as it
*25:44.620- 25:48.460* :  gets hotter. So governments are going to have to focus on the loss of productivity. Then we know
*25:48.460- 25:53.080* :  that it's a silent killer. We know that people are dying because of extreme heat. I think
*25:53.080- 25:57.100* :  governments are going to be forced to really focus on the adaptation that we need to
*25:57.500- 26:01.900* :  the extreme heat that comes from climate change while we also fight the battles that Miles is
*26:01.900- 26:05.840* :  talking about, which is the way in which we still subsidise the fossil fuel industry. Governments
*26:05.840- 26:10.340* :  are just not going to have a choice. Rachel Cahyd and Miles Allen talking to Caroline White.
*26:11.100- 26:16.100* :  The fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg once described herself as living a man's life,
*26:16.100- 26:22.780* :  but in high heels. The rap dress she created became a phenomenon in the 1970s as women began to
*26:22.780- 26:27.760* :  find their own style in the workplace. 50 years on there's a new documentary about her on Disney
*26:27.760- 26:33.740* :  Plus called Diane von Furstenberg Woman in Charge. Our culture editor Katie Razzle went to meet
*26:33.740- 26:38.800* :  the woman known as a DVF and the Oscar-winning director of the film. DVF.
*26:38.800- 26:44.120* :  DVF. Fashion tycoon. The influencer. The feminist icon. I didn't
*26:44.120- 26:49.160* :  not know what I wanted to do, but I knew the kind of woman I wanted to be. I wanted to be a woman
*26:49.340- 26:55.440* :  Diane von Furstenberg was a female pioneer in the male-dominated business world. Yes,
*26:55.440- 27:00.740* :  I wanted to have a man's life, but I still wanted to be a woman. A Jewish immigrant to America
*27:00.740- 27:06.680* :  who became a chat show regular. Welcome the woman who reinvented the dress. For the famous rap dress
*27:06.680- 27:13.620* :  she created in the early 1970s. It's a stretchy vinair, grabbed and tied around the waist that is
*27:13.620- 27:19.480* :  both flattering and office appropriate. Jersey fabric molds your body, makes you look
*27:19.480- 27:25.700* :  proper, but at the same time sexy. The documentary's director Charmin Obed Shinoy agrees.
*27:25.700- 27:30.400* :  The rap dress came at a time when high fashion wasn't accessible to everyone.
*27:30.400- 27:36.160* :  So many women found it liberating, you know, don't spend so much time on all of this,
*27:36.160- 27:41.300* :  spend more time doing the things that you love to do. There's a darker story influencing Diane's
*27:41.500- 27:47.180* :  life. In the Disney Plus documentary, she reads out the letter her mother hurriedly wrote on a piece
*27:47.180- 27:52.100* :  of cardboard and threw from the shuttered wagon of the train that took her to Auschwitz.
*27:57.180- 28:03.900* :  She wasn't supposed to survive and she did survive and she married my father and they told him
*28:04.140- 28:11.080* :  you cannot have a child. So my birth was a triumph. My mother used to say, you are my
*28:19.400- 28:23.820* :  torture freedom. My mother would never allow me to be afraid. If I was afraid of the dark,
*28:23.820- 28:29.040* :  she locks me in the dark closet. Today she could be arrested for that. But as a result,
*28:29.040- 28:35.780* :  she taught me that fear is not an option and the other thing is never be a victim.
*28:39.400- 28:44.780* :  Charmin Obed Shinoy is already a double Oscar winner for her documentaries about women's
*28:44.780- 28:50.980* :  struggles in Pakistan. She's now moved into the superhero universe. After acclaimed episodes of
*28:50.980- 29:01.660* :  the TV show Ms. Marvel, I actually have powers. She is directing the next and still secret
*29:01.660- 29:07.800* :  Star Wars movie. I've always wanted to tell stories of heroes. In my case, it just so happens that
*29:07.800- 29:12.640* :  the hero's journey is always a woman. Is it just so happen to you deliberately chasing that?
*29:12.940- 29:19.880* :  I find my inspiration so much in the strength of women. I think that Diane's life is an anthem
*29:19.880- 29:25.600* :  of freedom. And in the case of Star Wars, it's very much daisy riddly, but it's daisy riddly,
*29:25.920- 29:30.640* :  and so many of the characters that we're bringing back into the Star Wars universe and so many
*29:30.640- 29:37.280* :  of the characters we're breathing new life into. Diane von Furstenberg is a survivor who's overcome
*29:37.280- 29:42.700* :  the threat of bankruptcy more than once. And in the early 90s enlisted the help of the shopping
*29:42.700- 29:50.840* :  channel QVC. Silk assets by Diane von Furstenberg. I think that I identify very much with what a modern
*29:50.840- 29:56.780* :  woman... The documentary starts within a resting scene, a makeup-free Diane climbing into her
*29:56.780- 30:04.680* :  bathroom basin to do her face in the mirror. Yeah, she doesn't hide the fact she is 77.
*30:05.020- 30:10.740* :  Aging is living, so if you have aged, it's already in the bank, but in an industry that has been
*30:10.740- 30:19.900* :  obsessed is obsessed with youth. Well, I have never been that way, and maybe it has to do with
*30:19.900- 30:29.100* :  my mother. My birth was a triumph of life, so every day I have to honor life. Diane von Furstenberg
*30:29.100- 30:35.620* :  creator of the rap dress talking to our culture editor Katie Razzle. Finally to California and
*30:35.620- 30:43.200* :  this year's competition to find the world's ugliest dog. The world's ugliest dog is...
*30:46.080- 30:52.560* :  Well, wildfang had completed no fewer than five times before finally taking home the top prize.
*30:53.100- 30:57.760* :  The beginnings gets his unique look with his long tongues sticking out from a case of canine
*30:58.220- 31:03.820* :  and disease preventing the growth of his teeth. One judge, Fiona Ma, said it was about time he
*31:03.820- 31:10.720* :  emerged victorious. Wildfang was a fan favorite in the fact that he had been competing for five times
*31:10.720- 31:14.700* :  and only came in a second. It's kind of like the bridesmaid and never the bride. I think,
*31:15.140- 31:18.680* :  you know, really tugged at our heartstrings that, you know, he deserved to win.
*31:19.580- 31:24.680* :  In third place was a 14-year-old white-coated mixed-breed rescue dog called Daisy May.
*31:25.440- 31:29.660* :  Despite the dog having lost her hair, teeth and vision, her owner Elizabeth Whitehouse
*31:29.660- 31:36.820* :  was still surprised at the result. I'm shocked. This was not my idea, it was my daughter's idea,
*31:37.360- 31:42.420* :  and I didn't think she had a chance. I thought that she would be the most beautiful ugly dog,
*31:42.480- 31:46.180* :  but as it turns out, other people don't see the beauty in her that I do.
*31:47.200- 31:53.440* :  Second place went to 14-year-old pug Rome, whose wheelchair bound and received the online People's
*31:53.440- 31:59.680* :  Choice Award. His owner, Michelle Grady, was delighted. I love it. I love this whole contest.
*31:59.920- 32:07.120* :  I love that it represents dogs that are imperfect, imperfectly perfect. Yeah, Rome is,
*32:07.860- 32:11.700* :  he had the best time. He really did. Yeah, the best time.
*32:12.800- 32:17.820* :  Michelle Grady and you can see pictures of all this year's winners on the BBC website.
*32:20.980- 32:25.620* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back at the same time tomorrow.
