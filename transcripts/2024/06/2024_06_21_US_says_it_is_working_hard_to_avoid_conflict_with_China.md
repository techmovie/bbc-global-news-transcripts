*00:00.000- 00:01.800* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast
*00:01.900- 00:03.040* :  from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.080- 00:07.200* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*00:07.200- 00:08.740* :  This edition is published in the early hours
*00:08.740- 00:10.660* :  of Friday the 21st of June.
*00:11.080- 00:13.200* :  The American Ambassador to Beijing tells us
*00:13.200- 00:16.620* :  the US is working hard to avoid conflict with China.
*00:17.340- 00:18.840* :  Egypt says it's trying to establish
*00:18.840- 00:20.520* :  how many of its citizens die
*00:20.520- 00:23.020* :  during this year's hard pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia
*00:23.020- 00:25.160* :  where temperatures topped 50 degrees.
*00:26.220- 00:28.800* :  And the Canadian film star Donald Sutherland has died
*00:28.820- 00:30.400* :  at the age of 88s.
*00:32.840- 00:33.780* :  Also in this podcast,
*00:45.340- 00:48.540* :  does working from home make you more or less productive?
*00:53.740- 00:56.600* :  They are the two most powerful nations on Earth,
*00:56.600- 00:59.100* :  both in economic and military terms.
*00:59.640- 01:00.880* :  Despite being rivals, though,
*01:00.880- 01:03.580* :  the US and China have a shared interest
*01:03.580- 01:06.160* :  in avoiding disagreements getting out of hand.
*01:06.900- 01:08.360* :  That hasn't been easy of late,
*01:08.360- 01:10.620* :  but according to the US Ambassador to Beijing,
*01:10.620- 01:13.280* :  things have improved a bit.
*01:13.820- 01:15.100* :  Nicholas Burns told the BBC
*01:15.100- 01:16.800* :  he was doing all he could to avoid
*01:16.800- 01:18.480* :  a potential conflict with China.
*01:18.480- 01:21.500* :  He spoke to our Beijing correspondent Laura Bicker.
*01:22.120- 01:23.720* :  So what was his view of how US
*01:23.720- 01:25.020* :  China relations are going?
*01:25.840- 01:28.520* :  I think the keywords were relatively better.
*01:28.740- 01:29.740* :  And when I pushed him on this,
*01:29.740- 01:31.920* :  he really went with the relatively.
*01:31.920- 01:34.320* :  And that is because there were several months
*01:34.340- 01:37.200* :  if not up to a year with very little communication.
*01:37.760- 01:40.880* :  And the problem with that is that these are two militaries
*01:40.880- 01:43.580* :  that operate in very close proximity to one another,
*01:43.580- 01:46.580* :  both in the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea.
*01:46.580- 01:49.580* :  These are dangerous flashpoints.
*01:50.040- 01:52.580* :  So when it comes to military to military communication,
*01:52.580- 01:55.260* :  it seems obvious that the two should speak to one another.
*01:55.680- 01:57.240* :  But that has not been happening.
*01:57.240- 02:00.500* :  He says there is now an increase in communication,
*02:00.620- 02:02.500* :  which is relatively better.
*02:02.500- 02:05.360* :  When I pushed him to say how much better he said,
*02:05.820- 02:07.500* :  well, it could be better.
*02:07.960- 02:09.900* :  And he said that lack of communication
*02:09.900- 02:12.400* :  at a very high level is a problem.
*02:13.080- 02:17.200* :  But he did go on to reiterate warnings to Beijing
*02:17.700- 02:21.080* :  that Washington has made on a number of occasions.
*02:21.080- 02:24.280* :  And that is that they need to stop
*02:24.280- 02:27.840* :  selling components to Russia that Moscow can use
*02:27.840- 02:29.320* :  in its invasion of Ukraine.
*02:29.840- 02:30.960* :  They can test the facts.
*02:31.480- 02:32.480* :  We have the right facts.
*02:32.480- 02:34.020* :  We know exactly what's happening.
*02:34.020- 02:37.060* :  We know what's being shipped by Chinese companies.
*02:37.660- 02:40.620* :  We know the impact it's having and the ability of Russia
*02:40.620- 02:41.660* :  to conduct this war.
*02:42.180- 02:44.280* :  And so we're absolutely sure of our facts.
*02:44.780- 02:46.580* :  And the Chinese ought to own up to this.
*02:47.020- 02:49.700* :  We have sanctioned a great number of Chinese companies.
*02:49.700- 02:51.380* :  And we're prepared to do more, by the way.
*02:51.380- 02:53.540* :  We remind China, the Chinese officials,
*02:54.220- 02:57.300* :  they have considerable authority in this authoritarian
*02:57.300- 02:59.140* :  government over what happens.
*02:59.140- 03:01.740* :  And they can certainly crack down on these companies.
*03:01.740- 03:04.980* :  And they ought to do it because it is a major problem.
*03:05.000- 03:08.020* :  And it's a major assistance to Russia in this war effort.
*03:08.680- 03:12.440* :  And you also spoke specifically about Taiwan.
*03:12.440- 03:14.540* :  That's another big issue of contention
*03:14.540- 03:15.600* :  between the two countries.
*03:16.140- 03:17.820* :  Yes, I think when it comes to Taiwan,
*03:17.820- 03:22.660* :  he said that America remained committed to eating Taiwan
*03:22.660- 03:26.060* :  and that he did not see that as a potential source
*03:26.500- 03:27.960* :  of conflict between the two.
*03:28.120- 03:31.400* :  He said that that did not increase the possibility
*03:31.400- 03:34.500* :  of conflict, despite the fact that the US is our main Taiwan.
*03:34.940- 03:37.580* :  The United States, under the Taiwan Relations Act of January
*03:37.580- 03:40.940* :  1979, has an obligation, a legal obligation,
*03:41.580- 03:43.800* :  to provide defensive technology to Taiwan.
*03:44.660- 03:46.740* :  And obviously, we want that to have a deterrent effect.
*03:47.120- 03:50.680* :  And our major advice to the government in China
*03:50.680- 03:54.060* :  is it must commit itself to a peaceful resolution.
*03:54.440- 03:56.980* :  I'm not aware of any country in this region
*03:56.980- 03:58.500* :  who thinks it would be a good idea
*03:58.500- 04:00.480* :  for China to try to resort to force.
*04:01.180- 04:05.160* :  One of the issues that both sides seem keen to promote
*04:05.160- 04:07.360* :  is people-to-people contact.
*04:07.360- 04:10.020* :  But even there, there are issues.
*04:10.360- 04:11.740* :  This should be the easy part.
*04:11.740- 04:14.820* :  You bring people to Beijing and you bring people to Washington.
*04:14.820- 04:18.020* :  But both sides accuse the other of putting obstacles
*04:18.020- 04:18.640* :  in the way.
*04:19.220- 04:22.620* :  For the US, there is a level three alert on China,
*04:22.620- 04:24.920* :  urging visitors to reconsider travel.
*04:25.340- 04:28.200* :  For China, they say they're doing all they can
*04:28.200- 04:31.060* :  to facilitate visits between the two.
*04:31.060- 04:34.320* :  But America has accused them of standing in the way
*04:34.640- 04:37.260* :  on 61 separate incidents, they say,
*04:37.600- 04:39.620* :  where they have prevented Chinese people
*04:40.000- 04:41.840* :  from taking part in US events.
*04:42.320- 04:44.960* :  Now, when it comes to this kind of people-to-people contact,
*04:44.980- 04:47.160* :  Mr. Burns said that is crucial.
*04:47.480- 04:50.800* :  If they want to have some kind of basis going forward
*04:50.800- 04:52.700* :  to develop the relationship.
*04:53.180- 04:54.480* :  Laura Bicke in Beijing.
*04:55.380- 04:57.560* :  Well, China has also had strained relations
*04:57.560- 04:59.540* :  with Australia in recent years.
*04:59.640- 05:01.520* :  But these two have begun to improve
*05:01.520- 05:04.980* :  with the Chinese Premier Li Chiang visiting Canberra
*05:05.040- 05:07.220* :  this week for the first time in seven years.
*05:07.820- 05:09.740* :  However, there was a stark reminder
*05:09.740- 05:12.200* :  about China's authoritarian tendencies
*05:12.820- 05:14.940* :  when Chinese embassy officials tried to stand
*05:14.940- 05:17.280* :  in front of a well-known Australian journalist,
*05:17.280- 05:20.560* :  Cheng Lei prompting a rebuke from the Australian Prime Minister.
*05:21.240- 05:24.080* :  Cheng Lei had been detained in China in 2020
*05:24.080- 05:25.940* :  when she was a business reporter
*05:26.260- 05:28.700* :  for China's state-from-English language TV.
*05:29.100- 05:31.900* :  She was accused of spying and only released last year.
*05:32.200- 05:33.780* :  She told the BBC's James Menendez
*05:33.780- 05:35.140* :  about this latest incident.
*05:36.200- 05:39.500* :  I was attending the joint signing of agreements.
*05:39.500- 05:42.020* :  And while sitting in the second row,
*05:42.560- 05:46.540* :  because the Chinese state TV camera angle
*05:46.780- 05:49.340* :  would have caught me behind the ministers,
*05:49.340- 05:50.340* :  the Chinese ministers,
*05:50.340- 05:54.540* :  and also perhaps for fear of international news outlets,
*05:54.580- 05:58.980* :  planning the camera from the two leaders to me
*05:59.180- 06:04.680* :  to Chinese embassy officials tried to stand between myself
*06:04.720- 06:09.780* :  and the cameras when another journalist swaps seats with me,
*06:09.780- 06:13.400* :  then the other official tried to stand on my other side.
*06:13.840- 06:16.700* :  Do you think it was partly an attempt to intimidate you in some way?
*06:17.100- 06:23.360* :  Partly, and at least to show me that someone was there to stop me
*06:23.360- 06:26.420* :  if I tried something funny, not that I would have.
*06:26.740- 06:28.860* :  Because you were just there as a reporter.
*06:29.280- 06:31.420* :  That's right. And it was very exciting for me
*06:31.680- 06:33.400* :  because this is the biggest
*06:34.100- 06:35.980* :  Sino-Australian story of the year.
*06:35.980- 06:39.700* :  And I am reporting it in a place of freedom.
*06:40.220- 06:44.360* :  Did Australian officials get involved to try and help you
*06:44.360- 06:47.080* :  or at least try and move the Chinese officials along?
*06:47.480- 06:50.200* :  Yes. In fact, you can see very clearly in the videos.
*06:50.420- 06:55.160* :  There's even a bit of pushing by the Chinese embassy media officer
*06:55.720- 06:57.900* :  despite repeated requests.
*06:58.640- 06:59.620* :  There was no movement.
*07:00.220- 07:02.280* :  It was very distracting.
*07:02.840- 07:06.200* :  It did remind me of being in RSDL,
*07:06.460- 07:09.100* :  residential surveillance at a designated location,
*07:09.540- 07:13.680* :  where for six months I had two guards to stand next to me
*07:13.680- 07:15.680* :  and sit next to me at all times.
*07:16.240- 07:20.220* :  What do you think the Chinese authorities now are worried about?
*07:20.700- 07:23.620* :  As someone who used to work inside the system,
*07:23.780- 07:28.900* :  albeit the English arm, I know that for each of these state visits,
*07:29.500- 07:31.300* :  there's set script,
*07:31.900- 07:34.440* :  mode of Cade, the military band,
*07:34.980- 07:36.340* :  the effusive welcome.
*07:36.980- 07:38.900* :  They did not want anything else.
*07:38.900- 07:43.400* :  Then there is the fact that I do symbolise bad times.
*07:43.940- 07:46.940* :  Why were you detained and held in the conditions
*07:47.020- 07:48.980* :  that you just described?
*07:49.020- 07:51.160* :  I mean, the sort of official line was,
*07:51.320- 07:54.300* :  it was endangering Chinese national security spying effectively.
*07:54.300- 07:57.640* :  But was there an incident that triggered your arrest, you think?
*07:57.860- 08:00.800* :  Australia had asked for China to be investigated
*08:00.800- 08:05.780* :  as the source of COVID, China retaliated hostage diplomacy
*08:05.780- 08:08.840* :  is not something that China shies away from.
*08:09.080- 08:10.140* :  And why do you think you were released?
*08:10.960- 08:11.980* :  The government changed.
*08:12.300- 08:16.360* :  Also, we had a lot of public sympathy for me.
*08:16.420- 08:19.800* :  It just became something that they could easily do.
*08:20.200- 08:23.820* :  And has it been returning to some sort of normal life,
*08:23.820- 08:25.740* :  although I guess events this week reminded you
*08:25.740- 08:27.540* :  that things will never be quite normal.
*08:27.880- 08:31.260* :  I try to do justice to freedom in everything,
*08:31.680- 08:34.920* :  but always with the line in mind,
*08:34.920- 08:38.280* :  which is the worst day in freedom is better
*08:38.280- 08:39.940* :  than the best day in detention.
*08:40.620- 08:42.920* :  Journalist Chung Le, talking to James Benendez.
*08:43.840- 08:46.120* :  Officials in Egypt say they're doing all they can
*08:46.120- 08:49.160* :  to work out exactly how many Egyptian citizens died
*08:49.160- 08:52.080* :  while performing the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.
*08:52.600- 08:54.860* :  Temperatures at the Grand Mosque in Macca
*08:54.860- 08:56.480* :  topped 50 degrees this week.
*08:57.040- 08:59.720* :  And as many as 1,000 people may have lost their lives,
*08:59.720- 09:01.000* :  many of them Egyptians.
*09:01.580- 09:04.000* :  The government in Cairo says several of the deceased
*09:04.000- 09:05.700* :  were not registered pilgrims.
*09:06.180- 09:07.800* :  And they would investigate tour agents
*09:07.800- 09:09.520* :  who arranged irregular trips.
*09:09.880- 09:12.900* :  The BBC Salina Bill has visited a village in the Nile Delta.
*09:13.900- 09:17.360* :  We've been talking to the family of a 70-year-old lady
*09:17.360- 09:19.060* :  who died in Saudi Arabia.
*09:19.500- 09:22.580* :  They told me that she's put all her lifetime savings
*09:22.580- 09:25.360* :  to make this spiritual journey to Macca.
*09:25.760- 09:29.380* :  But she didn't know that it would have such a tragic ending.
*09:29.380- 09:32.960* :  The problem this year is that many of those who died
*09:32.960- 09:34.940* :  were unregistered pilgrims.
*09:35.240- 09:38.560* :  Those who went to Saudi Arabia on a tourist visa
*09:38.560- 09:40.520* :  rather than an official Hajj visa.
*09:41.060- 09:44.220* :  These people did not enjoy the same services
*09:44.440- 09:47.540* :  that were provided to the official Hajj come void.
*09:47.920- 09:50.720* :  They did not have air-conditioned tents, for example.
*09:50.860- 09:53.140* :  They did not have a proper place to stay.
*09:53.140- 09:55.600* :  They had to walk very long routes
*09:56.140- 09:57.200* :  between the holy sites.
*09:57.200- 09:59.700* :  They didn't have buses for transportation,
*10:00.400- 10:02.940* :  given the high temperature during the season
*10:02.940- 10:06.340* :  which has reached as high as 51 degrees Celsius.
*10:06.960- 10:10.820* :  Many of them couldn't take it and they eventually died.
*10:11.200- 10:13.100* :  We don't have an official number yet,
*10:13.100- 10:16.080* :  but we've been talking to the families of the victims
*10:16.100- 10:19.340* :  and all of them are still in a state of mourning.
*10:19.340- 10:21.800* :  They couldn't believe what happened,
*10:21.880- 10:25.400* :  but they told me that they feel happy for their loved ones
*10:25.400- 10:27.740* :  because they died in a holy place.
*10:28.360- 10:30.020* :  Sally Neville reporting from Egypt.
*10:31.080- 10:34.420* :  It's been hotly debated ever since the COVID pandemic.
*10:34.420- 10:37.620* :  Does working from home make employees more productive
*10:37.620- 10:39.680* :  by saving them from the daily commute?
*10:39.980- 10:41.960* :  Or does it hit the firm's bottom line
*10:42.080- 10:43.940* :  by allowing shirkers to slack off?
*10:44.620- 10:47.380* :  A new study of workers in China has come to a conclusion
*10:47.380- 10:50.820* :  as I heard from Nick Bloom from Stanford University in California.
*10:51.720- 10:54.620* :  We ran a randomized control trial.
*10:54.820- 10:56.580* :  We got a large multinational
*10:57.040- 10:59.040* :  and they allowed us to take two divisions
*10:59.040- 11:01.500* :  of 1,600 people.
*11:02.000- 11:03.720* :  They're all university grads.
*11:03.720- 11:06.000* :  They're like marketing, finance, computer engineering
*11:06.500- 11:10.180* :  and we randomized them between coming in the office five days a week
*11:10.940- 11:12.480* :  and coming in the office three days a week
*11:12.580- 11:14.340* :  and getting to work from home two days a week.
*11:14.340- 11:17.380* :  And then we followed them up for six months and saw what happened.
*11:17.760- 11:18.700* :  Yeah, what did happen?
*11:19.740- 11:21.240* :  You know, first of all, what didn't happen
*11:21.240- 11:23.220* :  there was no difference in performance.
*11:23.220- 11:26.920* :  In fact, we have data for the next two years after that
*11:27.340- 11:29.800* :  and we see absolutely no difference in performance,
*11:29.800- 11:34.040* :  promotion rates, reviews, leadership innovation scores,
*11:34.420- 11:36.560* :  lines of code written for the computer engineers.
*11:37.280- 11:39.940* :  But what did happen is the employees
*11:39.940- 11:42.280* :  that were allowed to work from home are much happier
*11:42.940- 11:44.400* :  and you saw that in a hard data
*11:44.400- 11:46.400* :  and that their quick rates fell by a third.
*11:46.880- 11:49.640* :  And for the company, that was a huge deal
*11:49.640- 11:52.960* :  because every person that quits costs them about $20,000
*11:52.960- 11:54.520* :  to re-high them.
*11:54.720- 11:57.180* :  And so they saw a massive increase in profitability.
*11:57.800- 12:00.460* :  So from that, it suggests that working from home
*12:01.000- 12:03.960* :  has a net positive benefit in terms of retention.
*12:04.680- 12:07.040* :  But it goes against what many people think
*12:07.040- 12:09.200* :  that you found no difference at all in performance.
*12:09.980- 12:12.920* :  Yes, there are people that have views on either end.
*12:13.300- 12:15.480* :  Turns out that they're roughly net out.
*12:15.520- 12:17.880* :  So let's talk about the positives for work from home.
*12:18.380- 12:19.560* :  One thing is you don't have to commute,
*12:20.020- 12:23.520* :  saves the average person in, you know, UK, US, Europe
*12:24.220- 12:26.980* :  about an hour and a half a day from less travel and less grooming.
*12:27.720- 12:29.040* :  And secondly, it's quieter.
*12:29.240- 12:31.780* :  So on average, at least it's quieter, so you can concentrate.
*12:32.440- 12:35.100* :  Downsides are there's less base time,
*12:35.100- 12:38.640* :  which means it's often harder to mentor people, get training.
*12:38.640- 12:40.480* :  It's a little bit harder to innovate
*12:40.480- 12:42.260* :  and you hear it's harder to build culture.
*12:42.840- 12:45.960* :  Turns out those positive and negatives just net off.
*12:46.140- 12:48.360* :  And so he saw absolutely no effect on
*12:48.740- 12:50.240* :  before it's positive or negative.
*12:50.580- 12:52.760* :  But could it make a difference if, say, for example,
*12:52.760- 12:56.160* :  your employees are young and just starting out on the job?
*12:56.560- 12:57.860* :  Yes, so it varies a lot.
*12:57.900- 12:59.360* :  So let's go to a couple of extremes.
*12:59.360- 13:03.040* :  So at one extreme, you have, you know, a 21-year-old,
*13:03.040- 13:04.300* :  I teach at Stanford University,
*13:04.300- 13:07.080* :  I have a lot of students that are about to start jobs.
*13:07.080- 13:10.040* :  And they very keen on getting in-person training.
*13:10.040- 13:12.600* :  So imagine you got a 21-year-old fresh,
*13:13.020- 13:13.880* :  raised new hire.
*13:14.360- 13:17.200* :  They probably are best off coming in three,
*13:17.200- 13:19.680* :  maybe four days a week to get in-person training.
*13:19.680- 13:20.940* :  So they go fully remote.
*13:21.180- 13:23.680* :  It's pretty likely they're going to suffer on training.
*13:23.680- 13:26.200* :  At the other extreme, let's go to somebody,
*13:26.200- 13:28.080* :  maybe mid-late 30s.
*13:28.380- 13:30.340* :  Very experienced been doing the same role.
*13:30.340- 13:32.760* :  Let's say coding for 15 years.
*13:33.180- 13:34.560* :  They may actually be more productive
*13:34.560- 13:37.080* :  if they're working from home for even five days a week.
*13:37.500- 13:39.800* :  And I was talking to Nick Bloom from Stanford University.
*13:42.580- 13:44.520* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast.
*13:44.880- 13:46.760* :  It's had a conservationist purring.
*13:46.820- 13:48.360* :  It's a rare success story.
*13:48.360- 13:50.260* :  We always hear of these animal species
*13:50.320- 13:51.800* :  that are going down, down, down,
*13:52.200- 13:53.440* :  with a collapse in biodiversity.
*13:53.700- 13:57.380* :  The Spanish feline that looks to have been saved from extinction.
*14:03.060- 14:07.780* :  The Indian Government of Narendra Modi has been accused of ruining the education system.
*14:08.020- 14:09.520* :  After it canceled an exam,
*14:09.520- 14:11.700* :  taken by nearly one million candidates.
*14:12.320- 14:15.700* :  I heard more from our South Asia Regional Editor, and Barasan Etirajan.
*14:16.260- 14:20.680* :  These tests are important because they play a very crucial role
*14:21.240- 14:24.500* :  in the lives of tens of millions of youngsters in India,
*14:24.500- 14:28.880* :  both for students as well as those who are aspiring to get government jobs.
*14:29.240- 14:30.820* :  If you go to any family,
*14:31.220- 14:33.160* :  they will be preparing for their kids,
*14:33.160- 14:35.820* :  sending them to education centers, training centers,
*14:36.360- 14:37.600* :  to be preparing for the exam.
*14:37.600- 14:40.620* :  And that's why it is resonating across the country.
*14:40.920- 14:44.980* :  Now, what the opposition and the student community leaders are saying is that
*14:45.400- 14:47.540* :  there have been a number of irregularities
*14:47.960- 14:50.560* :  in the tests conducted by the National Testing Agency.
*14:50.560- 14:53.960* :  For example, an exam was conducted earlier this week
*14:54.460- 14:57.620* :  for those who are aspiring to be university teachers,
*14:57.620- 14:59.700* :  as well as for the PhD students.
*15:00.080- 15:01.800* :  Days after the exam was over,
*15:01.800- 15:03.500* :  the government cancelled the whole exam,
*15:03.500- 15:06.660* :  saying that there was some input from the cybercrime agency
*15:06.660- 15:09.240* :  that the exam may have been compromised.
*15:09.240- 15:11.460* :  And in fact, a short while ago,
*15:11.460- 15:14.200* :  the Education Minister Darmendra Pradhan said
*15:14.660- 15:16.980* :  that the question paper was leaked on Dark Web.
*15:16.980- 15:19.860* :  Now, 900,000 people took this exam.
*15:19.860- 15:23.460* :  They would have spent huge amount of time and money
*15:23.540- 15:25.000* :  while preparing for this exam.
*15:25.580- 15:28.000* :  This is triggering a nationwide protest
*15:28.000- 15:31.840* :  by student unions, as well as the opposition leaders.
*15:31.840- 15:34.480* :  The government says that they will look into the system
*15:34.480- 15:36.960* :  and review the way the agency is functioning.
*15:37.640- 15:39.060* :  Now, Barassan et a Raja.
*15:39.940- 15:42.280* :  NATO is getting a new boss.
*15:42.540- 15:45.140* :  Norway's Yens Stoltenberg is departing
*15:45.440- 15:47.120* :  to be replaced as Secretary-General
*15:47.120- 15:49.740* :  by the outgoing Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutter.
*15:49.960- 15:53.060* :  He is coming into office at a difficult time for the Alliance
*15:53.060- 15:55.620* :  with Russia waging a war on NATO's doorstep.
*15:56.140- 15:58.260* :  So, what can we expect from the new man in charge?
*15:58.260- 16:02.100* :  The BBC's Evan Davis has been speaking to Chennai and Bostersh
*16:02.100- 16:03.500* :  a journalist based in Amsterdam.
*16:04.300- 16:06.200* :  He's been our Prime Minister for 14 years.
*16:06.200- 16:09.640* :  He is possibly the central figure in Dutch politics
*16:09.640- 16:12.540* :  alongside our blonde bombshell here at Vilders
*16:12.540- 16:14.100* :  who you've probably heard about as well
*16:14.100- 16:15.940* :  who got the largest vote in the last election.
*16:15.940- 16:18.860* :  But Rutter has had four governments here.
*16:19.020- 16:20.280* :  They call him Teflon Mark
*16:20.480- 16:22.960* :  because all the scandals just seem to somehow
*16:23.200- 16:24.140* :  not stick to him.
*16:24.560- 16:26.920* :  He's a much respected figure.
*16:26.920- 16:28.000* :  He's a true pro.
*16:28.480- 16:31.140* :  A kind of, you could call him a kind of quiet, strong man.
*16:31.480- 16:33.860* :  And it'll be really interesting to see how he deals with NATO
*16:34.280- 16:35.800* :  because one thing he's done in Dutch politics
*16:36.240- 16:39.620* :  is he's brought together all kinds of extremely unlikely coalitions
*16:40.080- 16:42.580* :  and actually, frankly, given the mess
*16:42.620- 16:44.240* :  that the current non-government
*16:44.240- 16:45.700* :  not yet started governments in,
*16:45.880- 16:47.000* :  he's managed them quite well.
*16:47.600- 16:48.020* :  All right.
*16:48.440- 16:50.740* :  Now, this whole issue around Ukraine,
*16:50.900- 16:53.620* :  Hungary, I mean, let's be quite clear.
*16:53.620- 16:56.880* :  Rutter is definitely against Russia and Ukraine.
*16:56.880- 16:57.840* :  No doubt about that.
*16:57.840- 16:59.020* :  He's firm on that issue.
*16:59.300- 17:01.440* :  Yeah. Rutter has previously said about Putin.
*17:01.760- 17:02.920* :  He won't stop at Ukraine.
*17:02.920- 17:04.500* :  If we don't stop him now,
*17:04.540- 17:05.900* :  this war is bigger than Ukraine.
*17:06.560- 17:09.140* :  So he is a very outspoken figure on this.
*17:09.580- 17:11.820* :  He managed to get Orban's support
*17:11.820- 17:13.160* :  by saying, as you said,
*17:13.160- 17:15.580* :  that no Hungarian troops would be sent to Ukraine
*17:15.580- 17:18.400* :  and also that none of their cash would be used there either.
*17:18.980- 17:22.420* :  And he also made a kind of semi-non-apology
*17:22.420- 17:24.380* :  recognizing the pain that some comments
*17:24.460- 17:26.100* :  that he made caused in 2021,
*17:26.100- 17:30.740* :  when he severely criticized an anti-LGBT IQ law in Hungary.
*17:31.220- 17:32.680* :  General Chennai-Boztash.
*17:33.680- 17:37.120* :  Now, it's probably not true to say that excitement is building,
*17:37.120- 17:39.780* :  but the general election here in the UK
*17:39.780- 17:42.040* :  is now just two weeks away.
*17:42.340- 17:43.640* :  The main opposition Labour Party,
*17:43.640- 17:44.780* :  led by Kirstama,
*17:45.220- 17:47.180* :  is predicted to win with a big majority.
*17:47.500- 17:48.340* :  But to do so,
*17:48.780- 17:51.420* :  it might need to win over voters in Scotland,
*17:51.420- 17:55.200* :  where Labour currently has just one out of 59 seats.
*17:55.820- 17:59.280* :  Most of the rest are held by the pro-independent Scottish National Party
*17:59.280- 18:00.360* :  or SNP,
*18:00.360- 18:03.520* :  but opinion polls suggest a closer race this time around.
*18:03.520- 18:07.000* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson reports from Scotland.
*18:09.740- 18:11.720* :  Hello there, sir. My name is Gordon McKee.
*18:11.720- 18:13.300* :  I'm the Labour candidate, for generally,
*18:13.300- 18:16.040* :  and you don't need to worry, I will be voting for you.
*18:16.660- 18:20.340* :  I'm hearing Glasgow a city once considered Labour through and through,
*18:20.420- 18:21.400* :  but in recent decades,
*18:21.400- 18:23.900* :  dominated by the pro-independence SNP.
*18:24.360- 18:25.500* :  We're in the south of the city,
*18:25.640- 18:26.720* :  where with the Labour candidate,
*18:26.720- 18:28.540* :  Gordon McKee, who's knocking on doors,
*18:28.600- 18:30.860* :  and there's canvassing trying to drum up support.
*18:31.740- 18:33.620* :  I think this is the best opportunity we've had in a long time.
*18:33.880- 18:35.740* :  I have been involved in Labour quite every 10 years,
*18:35.740- 18:37.120* :  and it's been a difficult 10 years,
*18:37.180- 18:38.540* :  so I'm taking nothing for granted.
*18:38.980- 18:40.420* :  But it's certainly true that a lot of people in Glasgow
*18:40.420- 18:42.800* :  and across Scotland that have been SNP before
*18:42.840- 18:44.500* :  are now turning to Labour because they see that
*18:44.800- 18:46.020* :  it's the best way to beat the Conservatives,
*18:46.180- 18:48.120* :  and hopefully tell that to Labour government across the UK.
*18:48.700- 18:50.440* :  Thanks, but to get on with your door knocking.
*18:52.720- 18:57.640* :  All this matters because if Labour can grab a bigger share of Scotland's 57 seats,
*18:57.640- 19:01.760* :  it makes it that much easier for the party to get a majority nationally,
*19:01.760- 19:04.540* :  and for Sir Keir Starmer to become Prime Minister.
*19:05.140- 19:05.900* :  So how's it looking?
*19:05.900- 19:07.640* :  A question for Emily Gray,
*19:07.640- 19:09.700* :  managing director of the polling company,
*19:10.020- 19:10.920* :  Ipsoth Scotland.
*19:11.540- 19:13.360* :  On the evidence of polls in recent weeks,
*19:13.420- 19:15.900* :  it looks like a very close contest in terms of
*19:15.900- 19:18.180* :  the future between Labour and the SNP.
*19:18.660- 19:23.120* :  What looks clear is that the SNP are set to suffer losses,
*19:23.500- 19:24.380* :  come election night.
*19:24.940- 19:26.680* :  I think where the question marks still is,
*19:26.860- 19:29.440* :  is just how heavy will those losses be?
*19:29.780- 19:30.820* :  But interestingly, of course,
*19:31.200- 19:32.940* :  despite any problems that the SNP are facing,
*19:32.940- 19:35.540* :  support for independence remains high, doesn't it,
*19:35.640- 19:38.780* :  and has done ever since the referendum was lost in 2014?
*19:39.700- 19:42.040* :  I mean, the question of independence or staying in the union
*19:42.380- 19:45.400* :  remains one that the Scottish public are divided right down the middle on.
*19:45.920- 19:49.740* :  But what looks likely is that independence will be less of a feature
*19:50.220- 19:54.160* :  in voters making up their minds at this election than it was last time around.
*19:58.260- 20:01.340* :  The one of friends and welcome to the launch of the SNP
*20:01.340- 20:02.880* :  manifesto for the 2020...
*20:02.880- 20:07.060* :  Of course, the SNP are campaigning hard and continuing to make the case
*20:07.060- 20:09.820* :  that independence remains Scotland's best option.
*20:09.820- 20:14.320* :  The very heart of our beliefs is the principle that the decisions about Scotland
*20:14.320- 20:17.120* :  should be made by the people who live in Scotland.
*20:17.720- 20:20.340* :  So why, given high levels of support for independence,
*20:20.340- 20:23.740* :  is support for the SNP apparently falling?
*20:24.120- 20:26.300* :  I'm in the centre of Glasgow to ask people.
*20:27.220- 20:28.360* :  They've got a bit complacent.
*20:28.640- 20:31.840* :  The people at the top aren't as good as what they were
*20:32.260- 20:33.860* :  and the past as well, so...
*20:33.940- 20:35.680* :  But there's still lots of support for independence.
*20:36.260- 20:37.300* :  Yeah, including me.
*20:37.820- 20:38.980* :  There's things that are crumbling.
*20:39.080- 20:40.500* :  They've been in power for quite a while.
*20:40.920- 20:43.000* :  I mean, I'm not saying that I wouldn't vote to them,
*20:43.020- 20:46.400* :  but I'm definitely considering I vote a lot more carefully this year.
*20:47.340- 20:50.820* :  In recent years, I'm swinging towards a national split.
*20:51.320- 20:52.440* :  There's no day in any good, really.
*20:53.320- 20:54.980* :  So you think you're going to swing back to Labour?
*20:55.340- 20:55.500* :  Yeah.
*20:56.000- 20:58.960* :  But does that mean that you don't think independence is a good idea anymore?
*20:59.280- 21:01.960* :  No, no. I think it's a great idea, but it's no going out.
*21:03.320- 21:04.220* :  Simple as that.
*21:04.840- 21:08.340* :  Constitutional change does seem unlikely in the next few years
*21:08.340- 21:10.280* :  as any incoming Labour government,
*21:10.280- 21:12.340* :  like the current Conservative government,
*21:12.340- 21:15.960* :  would strongly oppose a new referendum on Scottish independence.
*21:16.720- 21:20.580* :  But long-term, the population will almost certainly remain split
*21:20.980- 21:25.100* :  and whether Scotland would be better off inside or outside the union.
*21:26.760- 21:30.240* :  Robots and reporting from Scotland and a full list of candidates
*21:30.240- 21:32.240* :  can be found on the BBC website.
*21:33.520- 21:36.700* :  It used to be the world's most endangered feline species,
*21:36.700- 21:38.660* :  but now thanks to conservation efforts,
*21:38.660- 21:41.940* :  the Iberian Lynx has made a dramatic recovery.
*21:42.680- 21:47.040* :  At the turn of this century, only about 60 adults were believed to survive in the wild.
*21:47.060- 21:51.800* :  Now, with young included, there are estimated to be more than 2,000 of them.
*21:51.800- 21:54.600* :  Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhard, takes up the story.
*21:55.420- 21:57.720* :  This is an extremely beautiful beast.
*21:57.960- 21:59.380* :  It's bigger than a domestic cat.
*21:59.960- 22:04.720* :  Think more medium-sized dog with pointed ear tuffs, a shortage tail,
*22:04.920- 22:06.400* :  and a lovely spotted coat.
*22:06.880- 22:08.600* :  They've split from other links,
*22:08.600- 22:10.340* :  Eurasian links about a million years ago.
*22:10.360- 22:11.900* :  So it's been around for a long, long time,
*22:11.900- 22:14.480* :  but it was confined historically to Portugal and Spain.
*22:15.000- 22:17.000* :  And it had a very, very hard time,
*22:17.000- 22:18.580* :  particularly in the 20th century.
*22:18.580- 22:21.500* :  It was exterminated ruthlessly as vermin.
*22:21.880- 22:24.360* :  You saw population collapses of its key.
*22:24.360- 22:27.180* :  Prey the rabbit with diseases like mexomatosis
*22:27.680- 22:29.280* :  and viral hemorrhagic disease.
*22:29.800- 22:33.760* :  You've seen massive pressures on its habitat with things like housing,
*22:33.760- 22:37.840* :  but also golf courses changes to its normal scrub habitat.
*22:37.840- 22:42.860* :  It was reduced to only two populations in Andalusia in southern Spain.
*22:42.860- 22:47.880* :  And since then, what they've done is made efforts to boost the amount of rabbits there are
*22:47.880- 22:48.800* :  that it can catch.
*22:49.120- 22:50.800* :  They've had captive breeding programs,
*22:50.820- 22:53.820* :  reintroducing populations into different areas,
*22:54.260- 22:55.680* :  better protection of its habitat,
*22:55.700- 23:00.160* :  and expanding its genetic diversity by moving populations around.
*23:00.460- 23:02.160* :  And that's had a huge benefit
*23:02.160- 23:03.980* :  because the numbers have turned around completely.
*23:04.240- 23:06.400* :  Yeah, it's had a conservation is purring.
*23:06.460- 23:08.020* :  It's a rare success story.
*23:08.020- 23:09.900* :  We always hear of these animal species
*23:09.900- 23:13.160* :  that are going down, down, down with a collapse in biodiversity.
*23:13.920- 23:15.660* :  One of the people involved in the project
*23:15.660- 23:18.120* :  called it the greatest recovery of a cat species
*23:18.460- 23:20.300* :  ever achieved through conservation.
*23:20.840- 23:22.420* :  And now the IUCN,
*23:22.420- 23:24.640* :  the International Union for the Conservation of Nature,
*23:25.120- 23:28.960* :  has been able to change its status from endangered to vulnerable.
*23:29.260- 23:33.180* :  But the fact that the population fell so drastically earlier
*23:33.560- 23:35.440* :  suggests that there could still be work to be done?
*23:35.940- 23:36.460* :  Absolutely.
*23:36.460- 23:39.300* :  Basically, it still faces lots of threats
*23:39.300- 23:42.080* :  in spite of huge awareness these days
*23:42.220- 23:44.020* :  and pride in many parts of Spain
*23:44.020- 23:46.060* :  about this endemic species.
*23:46.500- 23:49.240* :  Some of these threats are caused directly by humans,
*23:49.240- 23:50.480* :  so things like poaching,
*23:50.880- 23:52.320* :  but also road kills.
*23:52.420- 23:55.700* :  So last year, nearly 150 Iberian links were killed
*23:55.700- 23:57.540* :  on the roads of Portugal and Spain.
*23:58.000- 24:00.540* :  But some of the threats aren't so directly linked to humans.
*24:00.540- 24:02.360* :  So fluctuations, for example,
*24:02.360- 24:05.380* :  of the rabbit population that we were talking about earlier
*24:05.380- 24:07.880* :  because of disease is major thing.
*24:08.260- 24:10.160* :  Craig Hilton Taylor compiles
*24:10.160- 24:11.860* :  the IUCN's red list.
*24:12.280- 24:14.060* :  The fluctuations in rabbit population
*24:14.060- 24:16.860* :  because of various outbreaks that could affect their links.
*24:17.400- 24:19.400* :  They're also other diseases that can be transmitted
*24:19.400- 24:21.700* :  by domestic animals or by other angulists.
*24:21.940- 24:24.240* :  We also worried about how the habitat will respond
*24:24.240- 24:27.260* :  to climate change, especially the increasing impact of fires.
*24:27.700- 24:29.980* :  So there's still plenty of work to do, Oli,
*24:30.160- 24:32.340* :  but it's very encouraging thus far
*24:32.560- 24:35.380* :  as conservationists try to restore the Iberian links
*24:35.680- 24:39.120* :  across its ancestral range in the decades to come.
*24:39.680- 24:40.940* :  That was Danny Aberhardt.
*24:41.720- 24:44.160* :  Finally, Donald Sutherland, star of the Hunger Games,
*24:44.160- 24:47.840* :  the eagle has landed and mash has died at the age of 88.
*24:48.580- 24:51.600* :  Born in Canada, he made his breakthrough in the 1970s,
*24:51.600- 24:53.740* :  becoming one of Hollywood's most recognizable
*24:53.740- 24:55.160* :  and respected actors.
*24:55.880- 24:57.380* :  His son, Kiefer Sutherland,
*24:57.380- 24:58.680* :  followed in his footsteps.
*24:59.400- 25:02.440* :  Peter Goffin looks back at Donald Sutherland's life and work.
*25:12.020- 25:16.340* :  In 1970, Donald Sutherland was a 34-year-old journeyman actor
*25:16.520- 25:19.180* :  who'd strung together some small parts on British television
*25:19.780- 25:21.260* :  in low-budget horror films
*25:21.660- 25:24.500* :  and the Lee Marvin War movie The Dirty Doesn't.
*25:25.300- 25:28.660* :  Then came Mash, a pitch-black comedy
*25:28.660- 25:30.820* :  that, while set during the Korean War,
*25:31.200- 25:34.860* :  was a thinly veiled satire of the ongoing war in Vietnam.
*25:35.360- 25:36.360* :  Are you a beer drinker, Sarah?
*25:36.360- 25:38.380* :  Would you like to share a martini with me?
*25:38.980- 25:41.540* :  Martini, I don't think I'd love a martini.
*25:43.140- 25:44.960* :  I think you will find these accommodating.
*25:44.980- 25:45.640* :  They're quite dry.
*25:46.360- 25:47.320* :  Don't you use olives?
*25:48.220- 25:50.600* :  Can we do have to make certain concessions to the war
*25:50.600- 25:52.200* :  where three miles from the front line?
*25:52.200- 25:55.580* :  Yes, but a man can't really save a his martini
*25:55.580- 25:56.820* :  without an olives, you know?
*25:57.540- 26:01.020* :  Sutherland's turn as the irreverent army surgeon Hawkeye Pierce
*26:01.460- 26:03.300* :  made him a counterculture hero
*26:03.820- 26:05.120* :  and catapulted him to fame
*26:05.120- 26:09.160* :  as one of the great offbeat stars of Hollywood's new wave.
*26:10.040- 26:12.160* :  A lanky Canadian with a deep voice
*26:12.160- 26:14.200* :  and overly precise delivery,
*26:14.740- 26:16.400* :  Sutherland specialized in characters
*26:16.400- 26:18.140* :  who were a little off-kilter,
*26:18.500- 26:19.780* :  puzzled or paranoid,
*26:19.780- 26:23.460* :  a fitting symbol of turbulent 1970s America.
*26:24.340- 26:26.740* :  In Kelly's Heroes, another war satire,
*26:26.740- 26:29.420* :  he played a loopy hippie tank commander.
*26:29.980- 26:31.180* :  In the mystery film Clute,
*26:31.520- 26:32.880* :  he was a straight-laced detective
*26:32.880- 26:34.460* :  who falls for a sex worker,
*26:34.640- 26:35.860* :  portrayed by Jane Fonda.
*26:36.460- 26:37.540* :  And in Don't Look Now,
*26:37.540- 26:40.180* :  he and Julie Christie played a couple haunted
*26:40.500- 26:42.220* :  by visions of their dead daughter.
*26:42.580- 26:44.300* :  My daughter is dead Laura.
*26:45.140- 26:47.140* :  She does not come peeping with messages
*26:47.140- 26:48.860* :  back from behind the grave.
*26:49.400- 26:52.480* :  As he aged, Sutherland transitioned into character roles,
*26:52.980- 26:54.880* :  but the pace of his work never dimmed.
*26:55.460- 26:56.380* :  Beginning in 2013,
*26:56.380- 26:57.680* :  he played the villain,
*26:57.740- 26:59.400* :  President Coriolena Snow,
*26:59.800- 27:02.560* :  in the Blockbuster Fantasy series The Hunger Games.
*27:03.200- 27:05.360* :  We both know I'm not above killing children,
*27:06.520- 27:07.800* :  but I'm not wasteful.
*27:09.040- 27:11.420* :  I take life for specific reasons.
*27:12.080- 27:14.060* :  This film franchise introduced Sutherland
*27:14.060- 27:16.400* :  to a whole new generation of fans.
*27:17.160- 27:21.140* :  Six decades and more than 150 roles into his career.
*27:21.940- 27:23.800* :  Peter Goffin on Donald Sutherland,
*27:23.820- 27:25.580* :  who's died at the age of 88.
*27:28.020- 27:29.100* :  And that is all from us for now,
*27:29.100- 27:31.520* :  but the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
*27:31.520- 27:33.380* :  This edition was mixed by Lee Wilson
*27:33.380- 27:34.960* :  and produced by Alfie Habishan.
*27:35.080- 27:36.580* :  Our editor is Karen Martin.
*27:36.720- 27:37.620* :  I'm Oliver Conway.
*27:37.780- 27:38.980* :  Until next time, goodbye.
