*01:10.240- 01:13.900* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh, and in the early hours of Monday the 10th of June,
*01:14.040- 01:15.420* :  these are our main stories.
*01:15.980- 01:20.320* :  The French President Emmanuel Macron has called a snap parliamentary poll
*01:20.640- 01:24.460* :  after his alliance was on course for a big defeat to the far right
*01:24.820- 01:26.280* :  in European Union elections.
*01:27.400- 01:31.260* :  The Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz has quit the government
*01:31.320- 01:36.160* :  and called for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to set a date for elections.

*01:57.580- 02:01.740* :  The Disney cartoon character Donald Duck is 90 years old.
*02:05.480- 02:09.360* :  The French President Emmanuel Macron has called a snap parliamentary vote
*02:09.360- 02:13.620* :  after his alliance was on course for a big defeat to the far right
*02:14.040- 02:15.420* :  in European Union elections.
*02:16.320- 02:20.640* :  As we record this podcast, the results from the polls have started to come in.
*02:21.200- 02:23.240* :  So far, it's clear that on the whole,
*02:23.300- 02:26.300* :  parties of the right and far right are gaining ground.
*02:27.180- 02:30.660* :  We'll hear from Germany shortly and also our Europe editor.
*02:31.240- 02:35.160* :  But we start in France where President Macron gave a television address
*02:35.160- 02:39.140* :  on Sunday evening saying he couldn't pretend nothing had happened.
*02:43.020- 02:47.100* :  I have decided to give you the choice for our parliamentary future
*02:47.500- 02:48.740* :  by giving you a vote.
*02:49.460- 02:52.920* :  I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly tonight.
*02:53.840- 02:55.200* :  This is a serious decision.
*02:55.200- 03:00.180* :  It is heavy, but it is first and foremost an act of confidence.
*03:01.200- 03:03.140* :  Confidence in you, my fellow citizens.
*03:03.260- 03:08.460* :  Confidence in the capacity of the French people to make a choice that is right for them
*03:08.960- 03:10.140* :  and for future generations.
*03:11.020- 03:13.560* :  I spoke to our correspondent in the French Capitol,
*03:13.560- 03:18.700* :  Hugh Schofield, who says the French President's move has taken everybody by surprise.
*03:19.660- 03:20.560* :  It's come as a real shot.
*03:20.560- 03:21.860* :  Even the pundits were surprised.
*03:21.860- 03:25.640* :  Even those who follow French politics from the inside were surprised.
*03:26.220- 03:28.980* :  He's done it, I think, for at least two reasons.
*03:28.980- 03:33.300* :  One of which is that the state of politics was just getting too tense.
*03:33.740- 03:34.740* :  It's been pulled apart.
*03:34.740- 03:38.180* :  The reality of the country is not reflected in the institutions
*03:38.860- 03:39.680* :  and something had to give.
*03:40.160- 03:44.200* :  He decided that rather than going on and continuing with this
*03:44.900- 03:50.780* :  growing opposition to him in the country as reflected by this massive vote of the hard right today,
*03:50.780- 03:55.920* :  he had to go back to the people and redraw up the representation in Parliament.
*03:55.920- 04:01.040* :  To do otherwise would have meant for him another period in power,
*04:01.040- 04:06.000* :  which would have been rendered absolutely impossible by the constant tensions over legislation.
*04:06.080- 04:08.440* :  He's already hasn't got a majority in Parliament.
*04:08.440- 04:10.840* :  He was already having to scrabble to get anything through.
*04:11.420- 04:16.100* :  Any fight in Parliament would now with such a big vote moral victory for the hard right
*04:16.100- 04:19.900* :  would be very, very hard to get through and very quickly spill on to the streets, I think,
*04:20.260- 04:24.120* :  as it has before already, on the pension zones and that's one reason.
*04:24.120- 04:26.980* :  I think the other reason is that it's in his nature to do the unexpected,
*04:26.980- 04:29.480* :  to take people by surprise, to put people on their back foot.
*04:29.480- 04:33.260* :  It's kind of, he loves to see himself as a kind of d'Artagnan-like figure
*04:33.260- 04:38.000* :  who will suddenly spring a shock on his opponents and on the country.
*04:38.460- 04:44.260* :  And he hopes that that will galvanize enough people into keeping out the hard right at these elections,
*04:44.260- 04:45.940* :  but it's a very, very risky strategy.
*04:46.460- 04:49.000* :  Well, you've outlined there the difficulties he currently has,
*04:49.000- 04:53.240* :  but isn't he taking a big risk in that this could make things even worse for him?
*04:53.420- 04:57.420* :  There's no guarantee that he will get what he wants, what he wants,
*04:58.060- 05:02.780* :  what he's sort of banking on is that if enough good people in his view,
*05:03.200- 05:06.060* :  you know, turns to the country and say, look, we're in this situation,
*05:06.060- 05:11.460* :  we need to get a new majority, one of what he would call the Republican values,
*05:11.920- 05:12.640* :  and give it to us.
*05:12.640- 05:16.000* :  And he's hoping then that there will be alliances possible between his party,
*05:16.000- 05:19.220* :  the Renaissance in the centre and some on the right, some on the left.
*05:19.600- 05:22.200* :  So a new government forming, which would keep out the hard right,
*05:22.200- 05:23.840* :  but there's absolutely no guarantee of that at all.
*05:24.200- 05:26.520* :  Nothing suggests that anyone in his mind to do that.
*05:26.520- 05:31.300* :  I mean, these potential partners haven't been at all willing to join up with him,
*05:31.300- 05:34.020* :  particularly in the two years since he was re-elected in 2022.
*05:34.020- 05:36.280* :  So why would they want to do it now?
*05:36.760- 05:39.800* :  The constant warnings about the hard right just around the corner
*05:40.240- 05:45.200* :  have worked after a point in keeping, you know, the sort of centre in power,
*05:45.580- 05:48.280* :  but those warnings just don't rub off on people anymore.
*05:48.280- 05:53.180* :  I mean, when 32% of the country vote for the hard right,
*05:53.240- 05:55.180* :  and another 5% for another hard right,
*05:55.180- 05:59.160* :  by the sort of 40%, so four out of 10 people vote for the hard right,
*05:59.160- 06:01.700* :  where there are parts of the country out of the big cities where
*06:02.060- 06:04.900* :  it's more like six out of 10 people are voted for the hard right.
*06:05.380- 06:07.960* :  You realise that, you know, the country is a different place
*06:07.960- 06:11.820* :  from what might appear in the heads of the Metropolitan's,
*06:12.080- 06:16.080* :  and that's certainly the argument cosy being put out by the National Rally
*06:16.080- 06:17.940* :  that they do represent more people now.
*06:17.940- 06:21.840* :  And, you know, quite clearly they do, if you look at these elections.
*06:22.480- 06:23.700* :  Huseko filled in France.
*06:24.620- 06:28.060* :  In Germany, the far right has also made substantial gains.
*06:28.720- 06:32.100* :  The anti-immigration alternative for Germany, AFD,
*06:32.540- 06:36.280* :  has overtaken Chancellor Olaf Schultz's centre-left coalition.
*06:37.120- 06:39.760* :  According to a projection for German public television,
*06:40.100- 06:42.520* :  the AFD is on track to come in second,
*06:42.540- 06:47.820* :  behind the main conservative CDU, CSU, Opposition Alliance.
*06:48.700- 06:52.540* :  This assessment from our correspondent in Berlin, Damian McGinnis.
*06:53.220- 06:56.080* :  This is a disaster for German Chancellor Olaf Schultz,
*06:56.080- 06:59.000* :  much worse than was expected partly because, as well,
*06:59.600- 07:02.280* :  disasters for him personally, because his face was all over the country
*07:02.280- 07:03.300* :  on those election posters.
*07:03.300- 07:05.900* :  He really pushed himself forward in the campaign,
*07:05.900- 07:09.920* :  even though he's not running itself in the European Union parliamentary elections.
*07:10.540- 07:12.180* :  But he was the big face of the campaign.
*07:12.180- 07:14.440* :  So this really is on him, this big defeat.
*07:15.000- 07:16.900* :  And I think what we're going to see now are,
*07:17.180- 07:19.200* :  there's already been a lot of internal wrangling
*07:19.200- 07:21.360* :  within the three coalition parties
*07:21.960- 07:23.600* :  within that very argumentative coalition.
*07:24.100- 07:26.040* :  We're going to see even more arguments within that coalition
*07:26.080- 07:28.940* :  because each of those parties now is going to be fighting for survival
*07:28.940- 07:32.720* :  with key regional elections coming up in Eastern Germany in September.
*07:32.720- 07:35.660* :  They're going to be tough because the AFD could well become
*07:35.660- 07:37.900* :  the strongest force, the far right,
*07:37.900- 07:40.080* :  could well become the strongest force in those three elections.
*07:40.080- 07:42.800* :  And of course, we've got the national elections next year.
*07:43.200- 07:45.040* :  And so when you have a three-way coalition,
*07:45.040- 07:48.660* :  which anyway, you know, is already an uneasy alliance,
*07:49.240- 07:52.640* :  and if all three of those parties are feeling with their backs to the wall,
*07:52.660- 07:56.100* :  they're going to fight even harder for their grassroots voters
*07:56.100- 07:58.440* :  and they're going to fight even harder for what they feel they believe
*07:58.440- 08:00.880* :  and what they want in order to stay alive effectively.
*08:01.400- 08:03.860* :  So we're going to have a rocky time here in Germany politically.
*08:03.860- 08:08.180* :  And I think we're going to see some particularly difficult time for the government.
*08:08.240- 08:10.400* :  And of course, this is now shifted to the right,
*08:10.400- 08:13.660* :  essentially, the conservatives are in theory, the leaders.
*08:13.900- 08:15.540* :  But you know, they've only got 30%.
*08:15.640- 08:17.440* :  This was once a very powerful party.
*08:17.440- 08:19.720* :  So they're not doing quite as well as they should be doing
*08:20.200- 08:21.720* :  given how unpopular the government is.
*08:22.020- 08:25.080* :  The real winners are the far right, the AFD,
*08:25.580- 08:27.020* :  who are incredibly radical.
*08:27.060- 08:29.200* :  And everyone's surprised they've done as well as they have done,
*08:29.200- 08:30.940* :  given the number of scandals connected to them.
*08:30.940- 08:34.620* :  And a new upstart, anti-migrant radical left party,
*08:34.620- 08:37.560* :  which is also eating into those mainstream voters.
*08:37.560- 08:39.060* :  So a lot going on in German politics,
*08:39.060- 08:40.580* :  and I think it's just going to get rockier
*08:40.900- 08:43.700* :  going forward over the next year with those big elections coming up.
*08:44.180- 08:48.560* :  Damian McGinnis, the success of right-wing and nationalist parties
*08:48.560- 08:50.900* :  has not been restricted to France and Germany.
*08:51.560- 08:53.960* :  In Austria, the far-right freedom party
*08:53.960- 08:56.860* :  appears to have made history by topping the national pole
*08:56.860- 08:57.920* :  for the first time.
*08:57.920- 09:01.160* :  And the right has also scored some successes elsewhere.
*09:01.260- 09:03.800* :  Here's our Europe editor, Katia Adler.
*09:04.320- 09:06.080* :  First of all, it's worth pointing out that, yes,
*09:06.360- 09:08.660* :  this has been a vote for the European Parliament.
*09:08.660- 09:11.560* :  But for many EU voters, be they in Barcelona, Berlin,
*09:12.100- 09:15.780* :  or elsewhere, Brussels can seem pretty far away from there every day.
*09:15.780- 09:19.660* :  So they tend to use this election to deliver a protest vote
*09:19.660- 09:21.800* :  against their own national parliament.
*09:22.820- 09:24.720* :  In the end, with partial results in,
*09:24.720- 09:26.780* :  it looks like the centrist party still have majority.
*09:26.780- 09:30.180* :  But yes, big gains for the hard right and the far right,
*09:30.180- 09:32.520* :  as well, with voters worried about migration,
*09:32.660- 09:35.540* :  inflation, and the cost of environmental reforms.
*09:35.540- 09:39.360* :  But whether those parties can influence EU policy on that
*09:39.360- 09:42.540* :  will depend on their ability to club together to unite,
*09:43.020- 09:43.760* :  to have enough cloud.
*09:43.900- 09:46.140* :  And that will be tricky because there are a lot of differences
*09:46.620- 09:46.900* :  between them.
*09:47.300- 09:48.480* :  Take Ukraine, for example.
*09:48.480- 09:49.800* :  Take Marine Le Pen.
*09:50.220- 09:52.580* :  She traditionally is softer on Moscow.
*09:53.020- 09:55.240* :  She'd like to work with the party of Georgia Milone,
*09:55.240- 09:56.380* :  Italy's Prime Minister.
*09:56.600- 09:59.640* :  But Miss Milone is passionate about helping Ukraine
*10:00.080- 10:01.860* :  and about continuing to send arms there.
*10:01.860- 10:04.300* :  So working together on that will prove tricky.
*10:04.960- 10:06.320* :  Katia Adler in Brussels.
*10:07.580- 10:11.160* :  Next to Israel, a key member of the country's war cabinet,
*10:11.160- 10:12.580* :  Benny Gantz has resigned.
*10:13.460- 10:17.960* :  Netanyahu is preventing us from approaching true victory,
*10:17.960- 10:21.400* :  which is the justification for the painful ongoing price.
*10:21.860- 10:25.620* :  And this is why we quit the national unity government today,
*10:26.280- 10:30.780* :  with a heavy heart, yet we feel that it is the right decision.
*10:31.500- 10:35.460* :  We are now in the midst of a campaign
*10:35.460- 10:39.520* :  that will impact the fate of Israel generations ahead
*10:40.820- 10:43.040* :  in order to guarantee true victory.
*10:43.040- 10:46.380* :  This coming fall, when it will be the one-year anniversary
*10:46.380- 10:49.380* :  of this disaster, we should go for elections
*10:49.580- 10:52.600* :  and reach new government.
*10:53.680- 10:56.180* :  Mr Gantz has been expected to resign on Saturday,
*10:56.180- 10:59.820* :  but delayed his announcement as news broke of the Israeli
*10:59.820- 11:04.160* :  military's rescue of four hostages from her mass captivity in Gaza.
*11:04.880- 11:07.340* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, John Donerson,
*11:07.340- 11:10.120* :  is following developments he gave us this update.
*11:10.920- 11:13.880* :  There have been widely anticipated that he was going to make this announcement,
*11:14.700- 11:20.700* :  but he postponed press conference because of the raid that was taking place in the center of Gaza.
*11:21.360- 11:25.220* :  And he's gone through with his threat to quit the war cabinet,
*11:25.220- 11:27.600* :  which he's been saying he's going to do for some time.
*11:28.260- 11:29.560* :  And he's gone through with that tonight.
*11:29.560- 11:35.440* :  He accused Mr Netanyahu of putting political interests ahead of the return of hostages,
*11:35.620- 11:38.400* :  and he's called for elections to take place in the autumn.
*11:39.020- 11:41.320* :  So what effect will his move have?
*11:42.620- 11:47.660* :  Well, it won't bring Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition government down,
*11:47.660- 11:54.620* :  but what it will do is remove a, I guess, that sense of unity,
*11:54.860- 12:02.080* :  and it will, to some extent, isolate Mr Netanyahu and give the more right-wing,
*12:02.080- 12:06.460* :  extreme members of his coalition, a greater influence.
*12:06.460- 12:13.180* :  Now, Mr Gantz was a centrist, he was someone with enormous experience in the military,
*12:13.180- 12:20.660* :  a former army chief of staff, a former defence minister, and he, you have to remember that
*12:20.660- 12:26.020* :  in Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet, there's very little experience, and he was brought in to
*12:26.020- 12:29.980* :  bring that kind of experience in the wake of October the 7th, and that has now gone.
*12:30.320- 12:35.260* :  Now, going back to Saturday's raid, there are clearly very sharply different versions of
*12:35.260- 12:40.020* :  how many civilians were killed. Yes, the latest figures we've got are from the Hamas
*12:40.020- 12:47.220* :  Health Ministry, and they're saying at least 274 people were killed, and almost 700 injured.
*12:47.220- 12:53.000* :  It is very difficult to verify those figures, and they haven't broken them down into civilians
*12:53.740- 12:58.360* :  or combatants, but certainly what we have seen is the two hospitals in the centre of the
*12:58.360- 13:05.320* :  Gaza Strip completely overwhelmed with patients being treated, and growing outrage in Gaza
*13:05.320- 13:12.660* :  at the loss of life. Israel's military has put the figure at fewer than 100. That was its
*13:12.660- 13:18.060* :  estimate yesterday, but it's very difficult at the moment to get any complete clarity.
*13:18.680- 13:24.680* :  John Donerson, doctors at one of the last functioning hospitals in the besiege Sudanese city of
*13:24.680- 13:30.340* :  Al-Fasha say they've closed down the facility after it was attacked. The hospital was supported
*13:30.340- 13:36.020* :  by the charity Doctors Without Borders. Our Africa Regional Editor Will Ross reports.
*13:36.940- 13:41.240* :  For several days there have been reports of shells hitting Al-Fasha's south hospital
*13:41.240- 13:45.880* :  causing injuries and deaths, but now eyewitnesses say fighters from the paramilitary
*13:45.880- 13:51.480* :  rapid support forces or RSF have entered the facility. On Saturday they looted medical equipment
*13:51.480- 13:56.320* :  and vehicles and assaulted medical staff. This is yet another sign that there are no rules
*13:56.320- 14:02.600* :  in the Sudanese war. The army's also been accused of widespread abuses, but in this case the RSF
*14:02.600- 14:07.720* :  have forced a hospital where civilians were being treated to shut down. The paramilitary force
*14:07.720- 14:12.680* :  is widely reported to be backed by the United Arab Emirates officials there, deny it.
*14:13.200- 14:19.060* :  Will Ross. The wife of the British TV presenter and author, Michael Mosley,
*14:19.060- 14:24.280* :  who went missing on the Greek island of Simi, has confirmed his death. He was 67.
*14:25.000- 14:30.180* :  Claire Bailey said her husband had taken a wrong route while climbing in a remote mountainous
*14:30.180- 14:36.400* :  area and had collapsed. A search operation started when he failed to return from a walk on Wednesday.
*14:37.300- 14:43.040* :  Dr Mosley presented a range of programs on health and his books on intermittent fasting for
*14:43.040- 14:49.920* :  weight loss, the so-called 5-2 diet, sold millions of copies worldwide. David Silator reports.
*14:53.580- 14:59.860* :  Michael Mosley, he was to many of us, a trusted charismatic guru of good health.
*15:00.200- 15:04.960* :  A TV producer and presenter who was always happy to be a guinea pig in the search for a better
*15:04.960- 15:11.080* :  understanding of the science of sleep, fitness and weight. Most notably in 2012 when he was diagnosed
*15:11.820- 15:16.920* :  with type 2 diabetes. His subsequent weight loss and the impact on his blood sugars,
*15:17.500- 15:21.440* :  using intermittent fasting inspired thousands to follow the 5-2 diet.
*15:23.820- 15:27.400* :  Michael Mosley's enthusiasm for experimenting on himself
*15:27.400- 15:31.760* :  had been inspired by a scientist who had proved that ulcers were caused by bacteria
*15:32.260- 15:37.640* :  by deliberately infecting himself. Michael Mosley realised self-experiments might have more
*15:37.640- 15:43.900* :  impacts than charts and graphs, and nothing seemed to daunt him, even once infested himself with
*15:44.040- 15:56.560* :  tapeworms. There they go. That is it. That is the tapeworm. You can see it. Oh god, that is horrible.
*15:57.080- 16:01.940* :  You can just see its tail and its segments waving around. But there was always a serious point.
*16:01.940- 16:08.180* :  If type 2 diabetes could be reversed or chronic insomnia helped, he wanted to test the research
*16:08.180- 16:13.220* :  himself. There are many who have told us to eat our greens or cut down on sugar.
*16:13.700- 16:18.500* :  Michael Mosley had the rare gift of encouraging thousands of us to actually do it.
*16:19.160- 16:27.660* :  David Sillato. Still to come. Our depth at the moment is about 430 meters.
*16:28.080- 16:33.560* :  We have hardly any earthquakes. It is really stable, seismically, and the ground
*16:33.560- 16:38.980* :  with the conditions are good. Finland has a novel solution for storing nuclear waste.
*16:47.160- 16:52.760* :  One size fits all seemed like a good idea for clothes. Nice dress. It is a t-shirt.
*16:52.760- 16:56.060* :  Until you try it on. Same goes for your healthcare.

*17:36.960- 17:42.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast. Next to India, and on Sunday in Arendra Modi,
*17:42.520- 17:48.280* :  dressed in a blue sleeveless jacket, took the oath as Prime Minister for the third time.
*17:53.000- 18:00.180* :  I, Narendra Damodar Das Modi, do swear in the name of God, and solemnly affirm that I will
*18:00.180- 18:07.260* :  bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold
*18:07.260- 18:13.500* :  the sovereignty and integrity of India. In Delhi, there was tight security for the ceremony at the
*18:13.500- 18:19.940* :  presidential palace, and no fly zone was also put in place. And for the first time since 2014,
*18:20.060- 18:25.080* :  India will have a coalition government with no single party obtaining a majority.
*18:26.000- 18:32.260* :  Prime Minister Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance fell well short of a majority
*18:32.260- 18:39.560* :  in the 543 seat lower house. I heard more from our South Asia Correspondent, Yogi Tillamai,
*18:39.560- 18:45.760* :  who was also in the Indian capital. Narendra Modi took the oath of office along with dozens of
*18:45.760- 18:50.700* :  ministers in front of thousands of guests. It was a grand event at the president's house,
*18:50.700- 18:56.540* :  not far from where I am. And we had top leaders from many neighboring countries in attendance,
*18:56.540- 19:02.940* :  so Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lanka's president. We had the Maldivian
*19:02.940- 19:07.240* :  president as well, which was surprising because the Maldives India relationship has been rocky
*19:07.240- 19:14.260* :  in the past few months. Missing notably were the top leaders of Pakistan, China, and Myanmar. Of
*19:14.260- 19:19.600* :  course, there were a lot of political guests at the event from Mr Modi's parties, his allies.
*19:19.600- 19:24.020* :  There were some members of opposition there as well, and there were, you know, other people from
*19:24.020- 19:28.920* :  the field of entertainment, for example, Shah Rukh Khan, the Megastar was also at the event.
*19:28.920- 19:34.300* :  So a grand ceremony, but what challenges will he face with a coalition government?
*19:34.300- 19:41.240* :  This is a major setback for him. It is a victory that is almost feeling like a defeat. For a number
*19:41.240- 19:47.300* :  of reasons, one is he said the target really high. The BJP had a campaign saying they're going to win
*19:47.300- 19:55.940* :  more than 400 of 543 seats in parliament. What they've ended up with is 240, so that's way off
*19:56.220- 20:01.600* :  mark. And so the aura of invincibility that has surrounded them for the past 10 years, that has
*20:01.600- 20:08.020* :  surrounded Mr Modi, this larger than life almost undefeatable personality, that has been dented.
*20:08.460- 20:13.680* :  On the ground, the other thing is, he still enjoys massive popularity. There's no doubt about that,
*20:13.680- 20:17.960* :  but we've actually been in one of the states that turned out to be a big shocker for them, the state
*20:17.960- 20:22.600* :  of Northern state of Wattar Pradesh, politically crucial. And many people, you know, the Hindu
*20:22.600- 20:28.180* :  nationalist rhetoric, which became a major part of the BJP's campaign, it was very overtly divisive
*20:28.180- 20:33.580* :  in nature. That doesn't seem to have resonated with voters on the ground. They've told us,
*20:33.820- 20:38.240* :  unemployment is a big issue for them. Price rise is a bigger issue for them. And unless
*20:38.240- 20:44.080* :  that is fixed, even if they're, at my or Mr Modi, as a leader, they're not going to cost
*20:44.700- 20:48.480* :  their vote for him. So those are the issues that are going to be the big challenges for him going
*20:48.480- 20:55.380* :  forward. Yuki Tula Mai. One of the biggest problems facing the nuclear power industry is how to
*20:55.380- 21:01.100* :  dispose of its waste. At present, hundreds of thousands of tons are piling up in temporary
*21:01.100- 21:07.500* :  storage around the world. But Finland believes it may soon be able to offer a long term solution.
*21:08.240- 21:14.520* :  Our reporter, Adrienne Murray, traveled to Yuri Yuki on Finland's south-west coast to find out more.
*21:15.440- 21:20.400* :  With the press of a button, it's a brief elevator ride, almost half a kilometer underground,
*21:20.540- 21:27.980* :  into the depths of one color. Where, for the first time anywhere in the world, highly radioactive
*21:27.980- 21:35.200* :  nuclear waste will be permanently stored. This labyrinth of tunnel spans more than 50 kilometers.
*21:35.980- 21:43.040* :  And driving me around is geologist Thomas Pear. Our depth at the moment is about 430 meters.
*21:45.480- 21:53.500* :  It takes hundreds of thousands of years for radioactive waste to safely decay. And this underground
*21:53.500- 22:00.940* :  tomb is the final resting place for Finland spent nuclear fuel. Called Magnetite, the bedrock
*22:00.940- 22:07.720* :  here is almost 2 billion years old. And geologists think it's ideal for a nuclear graveyard.
*22:08.380- 22:13.380* :  Alkylwater and the whole western Finland is located in a really geological stable area.
*22:13.620- 22:20.520* :  We have hardly any earthquakes. It's really stable seismically and the groundwater conditions are good.
*22:21.200- 22:25.320* :  With the light of a torch, we peer into a dark chamber beneath our feet.
*22:26.180- 22:30.360* :  Remote controlled machines will do the work, slotting five meter long copper
*22:30.360- 22:36.760* :  callisters into these holes, before they're sealed off with clay and a thick concrete plug.
*22:37.360- 22:41.400* :  Eventually, they'll hold six and a half thousand tons of spent uranium.
*22:42.340- 22:45.180* :  All the waste Finland's five reactors will ever produce.
*22:46.500- 22:50.480* :  When operational, stocks of 40-year-old waste will be handled first,
*22:50.480- 22:57.660* :  at this encapsulation facility on the surface. Passed to a hemer is a communications head at Persever.
*22:57.920- 23:03.280* :  This is the room where all the magic happens. The whole encapsulation of this but fuel here,
*23:03.280- 23:08.700* :  the lead is open for the first time. Currently, most radioactive waste is temporarily stored
*23:09.080- 23:14.980* :  above ground. And worldwide, around 260,000 tons are piling up.
*23:15.820- 23:20.300* :  But Finland believes a geological tomb offers a safer solution.
*23:21.340- 23:27.380* :  Other countries are watching closely. Sweden, France, the US and Canada have similar plans.
*23:27.380- 23:33.220* :  However, Finland is years ahead. Construction of Onkalo began in 2004,
*23:33.220- 23:39.160* :  following decades of planning. You might imagine few would welcome such a facility in their back yard,
*23:39.160- 23:45.160* :  yet 68% of Finland's support nuclear energy. And in the neighbouring turn of Euro-Yorky,
*23:45.160- 23:51.740* :  locals have been won over by jobs and huge tax revenues. Finland's embrace of nuclear power is a
*23:51.740- 23:57.440* :  pillar of its bid to boost energy security. It also doesn't produce any direct carbon emissions.
*23:57.920- 24:03.920* :  Here is hailed as a climate-friendly option, but some environmentalists still worry about the risks.
*24:03.980- 24:12.260* :  Juha Oroma is from Greenpeace Nordic. If you think about emissions right now when the power plant
*24:12.260- 24:20.360* :  is running, yes, it's obviously carbon-free. You have waste that you should take care of for
*24:20.540- 24:26.900* :  enormous amount of generations, so it would be hard to say that it would be sustainable.
*24:28.320- 24:34.800* :  Well, some countries like Germany have said no to nuclear. Others like the UK are building new
*24:34.800- 24:39.640* :  reactors and watching Finland closely. Adrian Murray.
*24:41.100- 24:47.240* :  Campaignings underway in the Iranian presidential election, which will take place on 28th June.
*24:47.240- 24:53.560* :  The vote is being held to replace President Ibrahim Reisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash last
*24:53.560- 24:59.840* :  month. Six candidates have been selected by the ruling council. The most prominent is Mohammed
*24:59.840- 25:05.800* :  Bagheir Kalibaf, a former mayor of Tehran, who has close links to the Revolutionary Guard.
*25:06.780- 25:10.860* :  Sehvash Ardalen from BBC Persian told us more about the candidates.
*25:11.720- 25:16.740* :  The Guardian Council is a very powerful institution that takes us orders directly from the person
*25:16.740- 25:22.280* :  of the Supreme Leader, and their task is to vet the candidates who are running for office.
*25:22.880- 25:27.740* :  They have done this in the past, and that has been their main instrument to marginalize
*25:28.280- 25:32.820* :  the candidates or individuals who are deemed to be too critical of the system.
*25:33.460- 25:39.420* :  They have now allowed six candidates to run, and five of the candidates are very close to the
*25:39.420- 25:47.260* :  hard line or conservative camp in Iran. And one is known to be a reformer, but a very non-controversial
*25:47.260- 25:51.180* :  and non-charismatic figure. And what can we expect from the campaign?
*25:51.720- 25:57.520* :  Well, not very much, because as you know, this election was organized in haste after that helicopter
*25:57.520- 26:05.240* :  crashed, which killed Iran's former president, Ebrahim Raisi. They had to organize this election
*26:05.240- 26:11.600* :  within two months, 55 days to be exact, and there's not much left. So I don't think the
*26:12.100- 26:17.940* :  campaigning will be that intense, let alone whether the public will even take it that seriously.
*26:18.580- 26:26.120* :  But as president goes, the state TV will give equal time to all six candidates to air their
*26:26.120- 26:31.720* :  views. There will be a presidential debate held between all six candidates, and then it will be
*26:31.720- 26:36.560* :  left for the people to decide on polling day. And you mentioned there the reaction from the public.
*26:36.560- 26:43.200* :  What sort of turnout do you think there might be? Well, the last election turnout was very low.
*26:43.200- 26:48.860* :  Really, the threshold is 50%. If it's lower than 50%, then you can tell that the people are
*26:48.860- 26:56.200* :  completely disillusioned and dissatisfied with the regime and its entirety. But if it's over 50%,
*26:56.300- 27:02.960* :  you can perhaps say that there has been more hope that some change can become about. And that
*27:02.960- 27:09.640* :  is only possible if people take that one reformist candidate who would lean towards the reforms,
*27:10.880- 27:16.180* :  whether they think that he can really do much in the way of changing Iran's foreign policy or
*27:16.180- 27:24.840* :  the star economic conditions. The writer of Jurassic Park and many other best-sellers, Michael
*27:24.840- 27:30.400* :  Krutten, has a new novel out. Well, you might be surprised to hear that. He died in 2008.
*27:31.320- 27:35.940* :  But a few years ago, his widow, Sherry, found an unfinished manuscript called
*27:35.940- 27:43.300* :  eruption and piles of research. She enlisted another writer, James Patterson, a man who sold more
*27:43.300- 27:48.780* :  than 400 million books to help her finish it. Luke Jones has been speaking to them both.
*27:56.640- 28:01.920* :  In early 1994, Michael Krutten had a pop culture hat trick. The film adaptation he wrote of
*28:01.920- 28:08.100* :  Jurassic Park was number one. His TV show ER was the highest rated, and his novel disclosure
*28:08.100- 28:13.560* :  was atop the New York Times bestseller list. After his death, his widow Sherry found a mass of
*28:13.560- 28:20.100* :  papers and hard drives that contained research, unfinished work. One bit in particular stood out.
*28:20.200- 28:25.980* :  What I found was a partial manuscript in paper. So it was already printed out in paper in a file.
*28:25.980- 28:30.020* :  This book I knew always existed. I didn't know about other things that he was
*28:30.460- 28:36.180* :  necessarily working on, but this book I knew was there somewhere. And so it was really
*28:36.980- 28:42.100* :  chilling when I found it. And when it came to an abrupt end, I'm like, wait a minute, it can't
*28:42.280- 28:48.020* :  end here. Where's the next and the next and the next? Where's the story going to go? So I really
*28:48.020- 28:53.680* :  went in search of all the pieces to hopefully find the ending. And I never did. James Patterson,
*28:53.920- 28:57.660* :  who's shifted enough copies to make even Agatha Christie blush, was enlisted to help.
*28:57.660- 29:04.620* :  Were you a Michael Krutten fan anyway? Huge. I'd read everything that Michael wrote all the
*29:04.620- 29:09.460* :  novels, a couple of the screenplays, the nonfiction. Criter is known for his love of science,
*29:09.460- 29:15.820* :  fiction or otherwise. This unfinished novel is set in Hawaii and concerns a once-in-a-century
*29:15.820- 29:21.740* :  volcanic eruption. It is unusual in the sense that it has these two storylines, very strong
*29:21.740- 29:27.060* :  storylines that eventually merge. There's a volcano that threatens to literally destroy the island
*29:27.060- 29:32.280* :  of Hawaii. And there's something worse on the island. There are some toxic waste there that the
*29:32.280- 29:38.360* :  US military left. And if they get loose on the world, it's going to be an absolute disaster.
*29:38.360- 29:44.540* :  And I just love that. And Michael had written quite a bit of other manuscript, but not the whole
*29:44.540- 29:49.920* :  thing. And I want to find out how the heck would end. This kind of book, you really don't find them
*29:49.920- 29:56.140* :  very much anymore. That kind of book where you want to keep turning the pages, you want to see
*29:56.140- 30:00.860* :  what's going to happen. Obviously with Jurassic Park, that was that kind of book. But you don't find
*30:00.860- 30:05.460* :  that many anymore. I don't think that's a proper thriller. Yeah. And my strength is I can keep
*30:05.460- 30:11.760* :  people turning the pages. My weakness is sometimes I don't dig as deep as I should. And in this case,
*30:11.760- 30:16.740* :  because Michael had done so much research and I did more research. So I did dig pretty deep with
*30:16.740- 30:21.260* :  this one. And that was I think that made it a better book, maybe a better writer. And you've
*30:21.260- 30:25.560* :  written with people in the past, although they have been living people like the former US president
*30:25.560- 30:33.100* :  Bill Clinton, Dolly Parton, how did this process differ not having that other mind to bounce off,
*30:33.380- 30:37.300* :  but for what they've already got written down? I didn't feel it was that different. I mean with
*30:37.300- 30:43.660* :  with the president Clinton and Dolly, they would bring authenticity to the project. You know,
*30:43.660- 30:48.740* :  here's the secret service we'd really do in this case. In terms of this book, the authenticity
*30:48.740- 30:54.280* :  that I need was already there. There was a lot of research. And the tone was there. The voice was
*30:55.420- 31:02.920* :  there. That report by Luke Jones. If Mickey Mouse had any rival, it was Donald Duck. With clenched
*31:02.920- 31:08.780* :  fists and constantly either enraged or on the verge of rage, he was probably the opposite of
*31:08.780- 31:14.700* :  Mickey in terms of temperament. But all that fury hasn't stopped him having a long life. He is
*31:14.700- 31:20.560* :  after all only a cartoon character and he's just turned 90 years old. Terry Egan reports.
*31:21.560- 31:27.480* :  With his sailor suit and little bow tie, the white duck with the orange feet and bill has a star
*31:27.480- 31:34.640* :  on the Hollywood walk of fame. He's also appeared in more films than any other Disney character. None
*31:34.640- 31:40.840* :  of that though has done anything to temper his personality and the fact that his 90 years old
*31:40.840- 31:48.220* :  is unlikely to help matters. Pompus and inarticulate his first appearance was in the wise little hen
*31:48.220- 32:01.120* :  in 1934 where he refused to help a hen plant her corn. He then went on to star with Mickey Mouse,
*32:01.120- 32:07.600* :  the smart rodent Walt Disney came up with first but who was his diametric opposite. Viewers
*32:07.600- 32:13.980* :  obviously took to Donald though as he went on to appear in more than 150 films. Some of them
*32:13.980- 32:20.700* :  recognised at the Academy Awards. He's appeared on television and in comics and video games and
*32:20.700- 32:27.080* :  with the creation of Disney plus, Donald is as popular as ever. The man who's voiced him since
*32:27.080- 32:34.240* :  1985, Tony and Selmo says that with all the frustration around, there's a little of Donald in all
*32:34.240- 32:41.500* :  of us and the duck has sometimes been depicted, coveting the top job as Disney star. Considering
*32:41.500- 32:47.260* :  his popularity though and his longevity, Donald has little need to worry.
*32:50.000- 32:57.660* :  That report by Terry Egan. And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the
