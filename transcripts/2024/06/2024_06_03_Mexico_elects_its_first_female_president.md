*01:27.340- 01:32.920* :  these are our main stories. Cloudy a shame bound has been elected as Mexico's first
*01:32.920- 01:38.620* :  woman president in a landslide win. Nigeria's power grid has been shut down because of a
*01:38.620- 01:44.260* :  nationwide strike over the minimum wage, and scientists in Britain make a potential breakthrough
*01:44.260- 01:50.840* :  in testing for breast cancer. Also in this podcast, we hear from a brave Russian
*01:50.840- 01:58.920* :  librarian speaking truth to power. The situation in our country now is similar with the situation
*01:58.920- 02:09.480* :  in 1984. Total control from the state, and total control from the security structure.
*02:10.640- 02:14.520* :  And reports suggest that controversial fast food fashion firm,
*02:14.900- 02:19.660* :  Shayin, is about to float on the London Stock Exchange for what could be one of the
*02:19.680- 02:28.820* :  biggest share sales in history. We start in Mexico City with what many people are seeing as a
*02:28.820- 02:34.340* :  significant moment. A few hours ago, the electoral authorities confirmed that Mexico would have
*02:34.340- 02:39.900* :  its first female president. She's Cloudy a shame bound, a climate scientist, and the former
*02:39.900- 02:45.980* :  mayor of Mexico City, and she won a landslide victory in Sunday's election. This report from our
*02:45.980- 02:57.200* :  Mexico correspondent, Will Grant. As Cloudy a shame bound stepped onto the stage at her victory
*02:57.200- 03:05.340* :  party, she marked a genuine moment of history in Mexico. In a country where women only got the
*03:05.340- 03:10.800* :  votes in the 1950s, she becomes the first woman to break centuries of male domination with
*03:10.800- 03:20.600* :  a presidency. Her win echoed down generations of Mexican women, she said. For the first time in
*03:20.600- 03:25.840* :  200 years, women have reached the presidency. She told her jubilant supporters in the capital's
*03:25.840- 03:30.460* :  main placer, the Socalon. Those who turned out to support her were overjoyed.
*03:32.080- 03:36.600* :  It's historic, completely. It's for the women who are no longer with us and those who are still
*03:36.600- 03:40.720* :  fighting, not just in the political arena, but wherever women are concerned.
*03:43.980- 03:50.020* :  To see someone who comes from the grassroots struggle make it to the presidency. It's so emotional.
*03:50.020- 03:56.320* :  For me, it's marvellous. In a country with such entrenched
*03:56.320- 04:02.540* :  machismo, what Cloudy a shame bound has achieved here is no small feat. Other women have tried and
*04:02.540- 04:09.160* :  failed, including her closest rival in this vote, such as the Galvez. But her offer of continuity
*04:09.340- 04:14.820* :  of extending the governing party's social policies, which have pulled millions from poverty,
*04:14.820- 04:23.700* :  has proved hugely popular in the electorate. Her critics, however, are disheartened. At a
*04:23.700- 04:28.660* :  predominantly opposition-led neighbourhood of the city, voters said her mental, President
*04:28.660- 04:34.220* :  Andres Manuel López Obrador, is a populist and an authoritarian, and that the shame bound will
*04:34.220- 04:42.700* :  govern as his mere puppet, something she roundly denies. This election has been historic for
*04:42.700- 04:47.540* :  all the wrong reasons too. It's been Mexico's most violent campaign in living memory,
*04:47.540- 04:52.980* :  with dozens of candidates threatened and murdered. Even on polling day itself, there were incidents
*04:52.980- 04:57.320* :  of violence with two people shot and one of them killed in the state of Puebla.
*04:58.080- 05:01.900* :  After the incident, the head of the electoral body at the polling station announced that the
*05:01.900- 05:06.840* :  vote had been suspended in the municipality, to consternation from those waiting outside to
*05:06.840- 05:13.000* :  cast their ballots. Another group of Mexicans excluded from the democratic process by the drug cartels.
*05:17.560- 05:21.820* :  Cloudy a shame bound supporters of childhood presidenta, meaning woman president
*05:21.820- 05:27.740* :  at her throughout the campaign. Now though, it's true. Yet most voters want the president-elect
*05:27.740- 05:32.260* :  to prioritise tackling the drug cartels over all other issues in her entry.
*05:33.000- 05:38.620* :  Cloudy a shame bound, inherits a nation mired in violence. A challenge now will be to succeed
*05:38.620- 05:41.020* :  where so many men before her have failed.
*05:43.700- 05:48.560* :  Mexico is a nation of unenviable contrast when it comes to women's rights.
*05:49.340- 05:53.880* :  On the one hand, it was one of the first countries to have women make up half of all members of
*05:53.880- 05:59.800* :  Congress. But at the same time, violence against women is a huge problem. Almost 4,000 women
*05:59.800- 06:04.840* :  were killed there last year. Many of them specifically targeted because of their gender.
*06:05.400- 06:11.220* :  The BBC's Lordes Heredia was born in Mexico. She says this is a landmark moment in her country's
*06:11.220- 06:17.380* :  history. When I grew up, being a female president was nothing you could dream of. It just seemed
*06:17.380- 06:22.480* :  so impossible. I remember my grandmother, when I was doing a documentary for the BBC about
*06:22.480- 06:27.860* :  the macroculture, she literally told me and at that time I didn't have any kids. She said,
*06:27.860- 06:33.440* :  if a woman doesn't have a kid, even if she has a very important job, it's not worth her living.
*06:34.220- 06:39.520* :  Meaning women are there to be a baby machine, otherwise you're not worth being in this world.
*06:39.520- 06:44.580* :  And that was my grandmother, defending that in my family there was no macroculture.
*06:45.060- 06:53.120* :  I mean, so imagine how big it is that we have the first female president in Mexico. It's a big deal.
*06:53.560- 06:59.800* :  That was Lordes Heredia. A nationwide strike over a minimum wage is causing chaos in Nigeria's
*06:59.800- 07:05.540* :  public sector. The National Electricity Grid has been shut down causing blackouts across the
*07:05.540- 07:11.120* :  country and passengers have been left stranded outside Nigeria's largest airport. Our correspondent
*07:11.120- 07:16.440* :  Azizat Ola Olua is at the airport in Lagos and she told me what was happening there.
*07:16.980- 07:21.840* :  The destruction is quite huge. The two main gates led into the local terminal of the airport
*07:21.840- 07:26.820* :  have been cut and off by workers. In fact, they locked the gates, put down chairs and they are
*07:26.820- 07:31.900* :  sitting in front of it to ensure that no vehicle passenger gets access to the domestic terminals.
*07:32.200- 07:35.940* :  So quite a lot of disruption there. What about the rest of the country? We're hearing that there
*07:35.940- 07:40.200* :  is quite widespread blackouts caused by problems with the electricity grid.
*07:40.680- 07:45.140* :  Absolutely. The National Grid has been shut down by electricity workers and so they
*07:45.140- 07:49.700* :  store to a blackout across many parts of the country. The literary workers have also observed
*07:49.700- 07:53.660* :  this strike. Courts have been shut. Workers are their president but they're just sitting
*07:53.660- 07:57.380* :  doing nothing. So it's not just one sector that is affected. The main purpose of the
*07:57.380- 08:01.240* :  National Y Strike is the foster hand of the government to the negotiation table so that
*08:01.240- 08:07.120* :  listen to the demands of labor unions and they're asking for at least $300. Well, the government
*08:07.120- 08:12.580* :  is saying that it can only afford one ninth of that. It sounds to me as if this strike, we've had
*08:12.580- 08:17.240* :  a number of strikes over the last year. This one seems to be more effective. Why is that,
*08:17.240- 08:22.420* :  do you think? It's more effective because many unions are all on the same pitch this time around.
*08:22.420- 08:28.840* :  So at least 14 union associations in Nigeria workers have all agreed to observe this
*08:28.840- 08:32.660* :  indefinite strike because at the end of the day, if the new national minimum wage is
*08:32.660- 08:37.380* :  affected, all of them will be affected by it. So that's why they've come together this time around.
*08:37.820- 08:41.980* :  Now there is a vast difference between what the unions want and what the government says it is
*08:41.980- 08:47.820* :  prepared to give. What chances there of some kind of negotiation? Well, there are chances of
*08:47.820- 08:51.820* :  negotiation because just yesterday evening, the leadership of the National Assembly and some
*08:51.820- 08:56.700* :  state governors actually called leaders of the labor union so that an emergency meeting
*08:56.700- 09:01.400* :  asked them to show the strike action for today. But at the end of the day, it ended in a deadlock.
*09:01.400- 09:06.400* :  So it means that the government officials understand the importance of this strike and they know what
*09:06.400- 09:11.360* :  is going to do to the economy, which is already affected. So there is a possibility that it may
*09:11.360- 09:16.900* :  be called off. We don't know yet, but this is a resounding strike action on the first day,
*09:16.900- 09:21.920* :  which has affected many sectors across the country. And what is believed that they are going to hear
*09:22.260- 09:26.160* :  something from the government asking the leaders to get back to the negotiation table. But the
*09:26.160- 09:32.460* :  big question is, will the government agree to the demands of labor made out that, but will both parties
*09:32.460- 09:37.980* :  agree on another figure, maybe meet at the middle, something realistic? That is what many people
*09:37.980- 09:44.760* :  want to see. That was Azizat Alla Alua. Scientists in Britain have made a breakthrough in testing
*09:44.760- 09:49.520* :  for breast cancer, which they say could eventually prove a major lifesaver. They've pioneered
*09:49.520- 09:55.280* :  a predictive blood test, which can detect very small amounts of cancerous DNA in the blood. And
*09:55.280- 10:01.140* :  that allows them to forecast the return of the disease three years before any tumors show up on
*10:01.140- 10:07.340* :  scans. Dr. Isaac Garcia-Murias is lead author of the study for the Institute of Cancer Research
*10:07.340- 10:13.020* :  in London. He spoke to Paul Henley from Chicago, where he's presenting the results of his work.
*10:13.580- 10:21.360* :  It's about the testing between one and three cancer molecules mixed with one million normal molecules.
*10:21.780- 10:27.260* :  And in your research, were you able to identify every patient in the trial who later went on to
*10:27.260- 10:34.060* :  have a relapse of the disease? Yeah, correct. We had 11 women that relapsed during follow-up,
*10:34.600- 10:41.520* :  and we identified all of them with a lead time of a clinical relapse of 15 months. That's the
*10:41.520- 10:48.760* :  median lead time. The longest lead time that we identified was 41 days. So the lead time is how
*10:48.760- 10:54.520* :  early can you detect that somebody is going to relapse before they do that clinically?
*10:55.160- 10:59.660* :  And tell me why early detection is so important in this type of cancer treatment?
*11:00.020- 11:06.820* :  The sooner you pick up cancer, the more chances you have of treating that cancer earlier.
*11:07.280- 11:13.420* :  The earlier you treat that cancer, the more chances you have of that particular patient
*11:13.420- 11:18.660* :  responding to treatment. This is a big breakthrough, isn't it, because of the sheer numbers of women
*11:18.660- 11:24.000* :  who are diagnosed every year with breast cancer. I think well over two million women worldwide.
*11:24.480- 11:29.960* :  Yeah, that is correct. This is a very exciting breakthrough, because what we have in here is a
*11:29.960- 11:37.320* :  test that offers a much higher sensitivity, which allows us to find more women before they relapse.
*11:37.640- 11:43.000* :  Is there something about this form of cancer in particular that makes it more prone to return?
*11:43.000- 11:46.540* :  We're talking about a test that predicts the return of the disease.
*11:46.540- 11:51.740* :  Is that prevalent in this type? Yeah, depending on the breast cancer that you have,
*11:52.080- 11:56.960* :  some of them are more aggressive and come back earlier. Some of them are slightly
*11:56.960- 12:04.060* :  bit more indolent and take more years to come back. Our test allows us to identify which
*12:04.060- 12:08.700* :  patients are going to relapse irrespectively of the breast cancer they have.
*12:09.340- 12:12.400* :  That was the cancer specialist Dr. Isaac Garcia Mordyes.
*12:13.240- 12:18.780* :  In recent years, particularly since Brexit, the once mighty London stock exchange has lost out
*12:18.780- 12:25.300* :  to other financial centres like New York, Paris or Frankfurt. But now, London could be about to have
*12:25.300- 12:31.600* :  its largest ever launch. The fashion firm, Shane, is preparing to sell shares in a public
*12:31.600- 12:37.880* :  offering worth more than $60 billion. The business was founded in China, but is now based in Singapore.
*12:37.980- 12:44.400* :  Our correspondent David Willis tell me more about it. It is the world's largest fashion retailer
*12:44.760- 12:51.160* :  and it offers a wide range of cheap clothes backed by this big social media campaign,
*12:51.160- 12:59.360* :  which it's mounted across various platforms. It's seen profits of $2 billion in 2023 alone.
*12:59.360- 13:07.560* :  It currently operates in more than 150 countries, both 150 million global users and the reports suggest
*13:07.560- 13:14.620* :  that China is preparing to float on the London stock exchange. It's been valued at about 50
*13:14.620- 13:21.760* :  billion pounds at $66 billion. So the flotation, if it does go ahead, could be the largest
*13:21.760- 13:27.480* :  in the history of the London stock exchange. So it will be very good for the London stock exchange
*13:27.480- 13:34.040* :  at a time when other flotations are moving elsewhere. And yet, this company, Shane, is controversial,
*13:34.040- 13:40.880* :  isn't it? It is. It relies on thousands of third-party suppliers, as well as contract manufacturers
*13:40.880- 13:49.080* :  in China, and can turn around a new item in just a matter of weeks, which is not something that many
*13:49.080- 13:56.040* :  of its competitors can claim, but it's faced allegations that weger force labour has been used
*13:56.040- 14:02.920* :  to make some of the products that it sells. And indeed last month, a report suggested that workers
*14:02.920- 14:10.400* :  for some of Shane's suppliers were working as much as 75 hours a week, that despite promises
*14:11.060- 14:16.220* :  that the company has made in the past, that it would improve its working conditions. Indeed,
*14:16.220- 14:22.100* :  the Swiss advocacy group, Public Eye, found that staff across six sites in the Chinese
*14:22.100- 14:28.240* :  manufacturing hub of Guangzhou were working excessive over time. Shane had initially been looking
*14:28.240- 14:34.240* :  to list on the New York Stock Exchange. That was before regulatory hurdles got in the way,
*14:34.900- 14:41.880* :  but you're absolutely right. An IPO of this size on the London stock exchange would be a coup
*14:41.880- 14:47.660* :  for that exchange, which has been losing listings to its New York rivals, New York Stock Exchange,
*14:47.660- 14:53.740* :  and Nasdaq, of course. David Willis. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*14:53.740- 15:00.480* :  Russia has intensified its crackdown on dissent. A string of repressive laws has been adopted
*15:00.480- 15:06.400* :  to silence criticism of the war and of the Kremlin. But as our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports
*15:06.400- 15:12.160* :  from the city of Ivanova, a famous novel, which was published 75 years ago, is giving some
*15:12.160- 15:16.020* :  Russians a way to vent their concern at the direction their countries taken.
*15:18.380- 15:25.780* :  Drive four hours from Moscow to Ivanova, and you will discover a most remarkable place. The tiny
*15:25.780- 15:35.620* :  library, and hanging outside, is a portrait of George Orwell. Librarian Alexandra Karasiva
*15:35.620- 15:42.600* :  shows me around the George Orwell Library. It was set up after Russia's full-scale invasion of
*15:42.600- 15:50.220* :  Ukraine as an antidote to propaganda and a reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism. There are
*15:50.220- 15:56.940* :  books here about Stalin's terror and the crimes of communism and multiple copies of Orwell's
*15:56.940- 16:06.900* :  1984. Alexandra explains why. The situation in our country now is similar with the situation
*16:06.900- 16:17.580* :  in 1984. Total control from the state and total control from the security structure.
*16:19.820- 16:26.960* :  One other similarity, the manipulation of reality. On state TV here, Russia's invasion of
*16:26.960- 16:34.880* :  Ukraine is presented as an act of self-defense, occupation, as liberation. Reality inverted
*16:35.680- 16:43.380* :  just as in 1984, citizens are told that war is peace and ignorance is strength. Alexandra believes
*16:43.380- 16:51.500* :  that in such an environment, the library fulfills a vital function. These books show our release that
*16:51.500- 17:00.700* :  the power of democratic regimes is not forever, that every system has its weak points.
*17:00.780- 17:07.400* :  These books are not banned in Russia, but the subject matter is sensitive. Honest discussion
*17:07.400- 17:14.560* :  of Russia's past or present can bring problems and problems they have. The local businessman who
*17:14.560- 17:20.200* :  was funding the project has fled abroad and is wanted by police. And there's another issue.
*17:20.380- 17:27.480* :  The library doesn't have many visitors. A dystopian future, few in Ivanova, seem worried.
*17:30.560- 17:36.720* :  In the town center, it's a big band, not big brother, that's drawing a crowd. People are
*17:36.740- 17:44.100* :  dancing in the sunshine to classic Soviet melodies. Some here embrace the direction in which Russia's
*17:44.420- 17:51.560* :  moving. Making progress says a young lady called Natalia. As Putin says, for Russia, this is a new
*17:51.560- 17:59.860* :  stage. But what about Russia's war in Ukraine? I don't watch anything about that now. Nina says,
*18:00.060- 18:10.080* :  it's just too upsetting. Back at the George Orwell Library, Alexandra breaks some news to the
*18:10.080- 18:15.660* :  handful of visitors. The buildings being put up for sale, the library has to move out.
*18:16.380- 18:22.600* :  Immediately, one woman offers use of her van to help move to temporary premises. Other people
*18:22.600- 18:30.260* :  suggest ideas on how to raise money. This is civil society in action, admittedly on a tiny scale

*20:11.740- 20:16.240* :  We've just had the first criminal trial of a former president in the United States.
*20:16.920- 20:21.780* :  And starting just as we're recording this podcast, America brings us the first criminal trial
*20:21.780- 20:28.900* :  of a president's child. For Joe Biden, it is uncomfortable timing as his son Hunter appears in court
*20:28.900- 20:35.060* :  just months before the November election. Hank Shinecoff is a political consultant and former
*20:35.060- 20:40.820* :  member of Bill Clinton's media team. In a close election, people that are not like you Joe Biden,
*20:40.820- 20:45.000* :  they're not going to like Hunter Biden, but you can equate the president's son to the former
*20:45.000- 20:50.340* :  United States. You know, in American politics, November is about 300 years away from now because
*20:50.640- 20:54.200* :  in the United States, anything can happen and usually does during an election cycle,
*20:54.620- 20:59.440* :  where Trump's popularity is very strong, whether enough to make America great, again,
*20:59.440- 21:04.660* :  mega people, Trump's numbers will continue to rise. Their hatred for Joe Biden will increase
*21:04.660- 21:08.980* :  exponentially as will their disdain for Hunter Biden, but it's going to be hard to make the
*21:08.980- 21:13.920* :  president's son into a national issue. Just in web heard more from our North America correspondent,
*21:13.920- 21:21.880* :  Tom Bateman. This trial dates back to events in late 2018 when Hunter Biden went into a gun
*21:21.880- 21:28.760* :  store here in Wilmington, Delaware at the family hometown and purchased a 38 caliber revolver.
*21:29.200- 21:35.640* :  Now, critically, he filled in a form and also gave a record to the gun shop. Now, he ticked the
*21:35.640- 21:41.060* :  box to say he was not an unlawful drug user and he possessed this handgun for the next 11 days.
*21:41.300- 21:46.440* :  That started a chain of events which have culminated to these indictments being brought
*21:46.440- 21:52.760* :  late last year in which he is accused of lying on those forms because, so to say, the prosecution,
*21:52.820- 21:59.900* :  he was knowingly a drug addict at the time and in their view had been using drugs. He denies this,
*21:59.900- 22:04.980* :  although he, by his own admission, has battled with addiction to both drugs and alcohol.
*22:04.980- 22:10.540* :  What his defense says, he wouldn't have defined himself at that time as addicted to drugs and
*22:10.540- 22:16.380* :  therefore he wasn't lying on the forms. But what this trial will do inevitably is to sort of
*22:16.380- 22:23.540* :  unleash in graphic detail elements of Hunter Biden's private life, which is going to be a very
*22:23.540- 22:27.940* :  challenging time, obviously, for the Biden family. And it's not the only trial he faces.
*22:28.180- 22:33.220* :  That's right. In California, he faces later this year as series of charges over allegations
*22:33.220- 22:40.440* :  of tax evasion. And obviously, politically, a real desire on the part of some Republicans
*22:40.460- 22:49.340* :  to link the allegations about him to Joe Biden. They want Joe Biden to be involved as much as they
*22:49.340- 22:54.940* :  can involve him in the lifestyle that you've described of Hunter Biden. And the simple fact that
*22:54.940- 23:01.280* :  Hunter Biden made his money peddling influence and that's something they say he could not have
*23:01.280- 23:06.100* :  done without the president. Absolutely. And that's been a very long-running claim of Republicans,
*23:06.100- 23:11.640* :  not least in the House of Representatives who began an impeachment inquiry into the president,
*23:11.640- 23:16.580* :  which is now midway through a process in the House. More than that, in this particular case,
*23:16.580- 23:21.900* :  Republicans are trying to say that he received preferential treatment by the Department of Justice,
*23:21.900- 23:27.920* :  something that the administration completely rejects. But conversely, Hunter Biden's own lawyer
*23:27.920- 23:32.940* :  has tried to claim that the prosecution was, in their words, of indicative and selective,
*23:33.580- 23:39.580* :  because the special counsel here, that appointment, early on, was by Donald Trump. So both sides are
*23:39.580- 23:45.780* :  trying to draw out the allegations that this is all political, both in terms of the way he's
*23:45.780- 23:51.020* :  being prosecuted, but also for Republicans saying that he's had an easier time than he otherwise
*23:51.020- 23:53.500* :  would have done, because the administration has run by his father.
*23:55.260- 24:00.480* :  The president of the Maldives, Mohammed Muizu, has announced that Israelis will be banned
*24:00.480- 24:07.400* :  from entering the country, as public anger has increased over the war in Gaza. Nearly 11,000
*24:07.400- 24:13.460* :  Israelis visited the luxury tourist destination in the Indian Ocean last year. Israel's foreign
*24:13.460- 24:18.900* :  ministry has issued guidance, recommending that Israeli citizens living in the Maldives consider
*24:18.900- 24:24.680* :  leaving. Ali Waheed is a former Maldives tourism minister. So what's led to this decision?
*24:25.340- 24:30.780* :  More than 36,000 people have been killed, and there's no justification to these actions by
*24:30.780- 24:35.400* :  Netanyahu and his government, and it has to be stopped. It has to be stopped immediately.
*24:36.040- 24:41.620* :  We, as people of the Maldives, are siding with the principles and the just right thing to do.
*24:42.220- 24:47.360* :  We are not blaming the citizens here, but I believe Maldives, even though we are a small nation,
*24:47.360- 24:53.220* :  and while we depend on tourism, we at least cut the cuts and courage to do the right thing.
*24:53.760- 24:59.040* :  Yes, it will have an impact on our industries, especially tourism, but the turbulence we will
*24:59.200- 25:05.200* :  take, because people who want to visit our country are more towards doing the right thing,
*25:05.460- 25:10.080* :  and I think the right thing is everyone to just say, stop it, we have had enough.
*25:10.760- 25:15.800* :  I was Ali Waheed. Now to an espionage route between London and Beijing.
*25:16.640- 25:21.700* :  MI6 Britain's intelligence service has been accused by China of recruiting a couple who
*25:21.700- 25:27.740* :  worked for Beijing to spy for the UK. We got more details from our China correspondent, Laura Bicker.
*25:28.140- 25:32.920* :  These allegations are actually posted by the Ministry of State Security on their WeChat channel.
*25:32.920- 25:38.640* :  Now WeChat is the Chinese version of any social media app. So they've got their own channel,
*25:38.640- 25:45.620* :  which they launched last August, and here they are putting details of allegations of spying.
*25:45.660- 25:54.100* :  Now, the allegations center around Mr Wang and his wife, Myth Jo. They say that he went to the UK
*25:54.100- 26:02.720* :  in 2015 to study and there. MI6 operatives, they say, recruited him. They took him out for tours,
*26:02.720- 26:08.200* :  they took him out for dinner to find his weaknesses. They said that he had a strong desire for money,
*26:08.200- 26:14.760* :  according to this report, and that the MI6 operatives exploited this. In fact, they say that Mr Wang
*26:14.760- 26:21.500* :  was initially hesitant, but could not resist persuasion, enticement, and even coercion.
*26:21.820- 26:28.460* :  And they say that eventually Mr Wang was given espionage training by MI6 and sent back to China
*26:28.460- 26:34.220* :  to learn more about the Chinese government and pass that information to MI6 operatives.
*26:34.480- 26:40.700* :  Now we've had no word from the British government or from MI6 on this, and the moment this is just
*26:40.700- 26:46.540* :  simply a statement reported by China from the Ministry of State Security. But this channel in
*26:46.540- 26:53.480* :  recent months has also posted information to citizens asking them to be wary of foreign
*26:53.480- 27:00.060* :  beauties, exotic beauties that may lower them into the hands of foreign spies. They've also asked
*27:00.060- 27:05.200* :  citizens to be wary about what they're posting on their social media, for instance, pictures of
*27:05.200- 27:08.880* :  airports, et cetera, that could be used by foreign spy agencies.
*27:09.680- 27:15.640* :  Now, what is it like growing up as the son of a Ku Klux Klan leader and then turning your back
*27:15.640- 27:22.980* :  on that ideology? Derek Black, who was born in 1989, describes that experience in a new book called
*27:22.980- 27:29.840* :  The Clansman's Son, my journey from white nationalism to anti-racism. As a teenager, Derek
*27:29.840- 27:36.200* :  ran the youth sections of his father's website Stormfront, which caused itself the voice of a white
*27:36.200- 27:43.720* :  minority. Among its readers was Anders Bravić, who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.
*27:44.340- 27:48.020* :  Derek Black has been speaking about the movement to Michelle Hussein.
*27:48.540- 27:54.840* :  Violence from this movement was so common my entire life. It was something that
*27:55.920- 28:01.320* :  we rationalized, my family rationalized, because they explicitly banned violent rhetoric
*28:01.320- 28:06.880* :  on Stormfront on my dad's website. People could be banned for that. And Bravić wasn't banned,
*28:06.880- 28:10.660* :  because he never said anything explicitly violent. He just said everything else about
*28:10.660- 28:16.700* :  this ideology that I was growing up in. And that ideology named its enemies, it said,
*28:16.700- 28:18.780* :  who shouldn't be here, who didn't belong?
*28:19.060- 28:21.580* :  Bravić talked about Norway being flooded by Muslims.
*28:21.580- 28:28.340* :  All of his murders, he just by with exactly the ideology that my family and I were advocating.
*28:28.340- 28:33.760* :  And yet every time murders like this would happen, it would say, well, they condemned violence.
*28:33.760- 28:39.760* :  So therefore, this one psychopath is not their responsibility. And it was something that was so
*28:40.060- 28:48.860* :  cold and so hard to rationalize that it did eat away at me in a way that I felt like I could
*28:49.600- 28:55.560* :  just accept, well, my family is condemning this violence and yet this movement. And getting
*28:55.560- 29:01.760* :  close to a college community of people who I cared about, I knew, I loved. Many of them were not
*29:01.760- 29:08.040* :  white, many of them were Jewish. And they felt afraid of what I represented. And if not specifically
*29:08.040- 29:14.200* :  me, they felt afraid of the people in this movement who commit mass murders regularly.
*29:14.200- 29:17.660* :  And the fact that I was connecting this campus to that world.
*29:17.660- 29:23.180* :  Publicly, your father, Don Black, has said about Stormfront that the number of killings that are
*29:23.180- 29:28.020* :  associated with his website is as high as it is, which is close to 100, because of Bravić.
*29:28.020- 29:33.660* :  They didn't have anything to do with politics. When you look back now, do you think that because
*29:33.660- 29:38.520* :  you were a part of what Stormfront was putting out, that you have a responsibility over what
*29:38.520- 29:44.880* :  Bravić did? I certainly feel an enormous amount of guilt for everything that I wrote as a teenager.
*29:44.880- 29:51.900* :  Especially in the later years, because I advanced concepts like white genocide, which is exactly
*29:51.900- 29:59.020* :  what motivated Bravić, this idea that just immigration and an intermarriage is genocide to people,
*29:59.060- 30:04.640* :  is something that white nationalists use to justify any action. They use to justify any
*30:04.640- 30:09.880* :  amount of violence. The fact that I put things out that I could never take back is something that
*30:10.160- 30:15.800* :  I'm committed and I have been for the decades since I've condemned white nationalism to advancing
*30:15.860- 30:23.160* :  the cause against it. But no matter what I do, I can never take back any essay I wrote or any person
*30:23.160- 30:28.180* :  who I persuaded to get involved in this movement. It's diffuse and I can't always trace it,
*30:28.260- 30:34.860* :  but feeling that responsibility is something that I've never been able to rationalize or move past.
*30:35.460- 30:39.860* :  Derek Black and the full interview is on the latest edition of the BBC program
*30:39.860- 30:45.980* :  Hard Talk. If you look up the term magnet fishing on the internet, which I had to do,
*30:46.580- 30:50.560* :  here is the definition you'd find. Searching in outdoor waters for
*30:50.560- 30:54.740* :  thorough magnetic objects available to pull up with a strong magnet.
*30:54.740- 31:00.500* :  recovered items may be dangerous, such as firearms, ammunition and bombs, you've been warned.
*31:01.100- 31:06.900* :  But the items may also be rather valuable. Last week, James Kane and Barbie Agostini
*31:06.960- 31:13.520* :  went magnet fishing at a lake in the New York District of Queens and they pulled out a safe
*31:13.520- 31:19.180* :  staffed with around $100,000 in cash. They've been telling Andrew Peach about the experience.
*31:19.780- 31:25.560* :  All magnet fishers eventually get some safes and I only felt different about this one
*31:25.560- 31:30.420* :  when I saw the hole. I was trying to bang it on the floor to get the door open so I saw the hole
*31:30.420- 31:35.000* :  on the end of the other side of the safe and I put it down back on the floor and I saw something that
*31:35.000- 31:38.640* :  looked like a long row of baggies. Sometimes when you find safes, you find little baggies.
*31:38.640- 31:42.040* :  I guess that's where they stored coins or money or IDs or something like that.
*31:42.200- 31:46.280* :  And I reached in with my hand and in my brain, I'm like, oh no, this can't be happening.
*31:46.800- 31:51.360* :  And what was your reaction, Barbie, when it was not only a safe, which is quite an exciting find,
*31:51.360- 31:55.960* :  but you could tell that it had got some money in it. At first, I didn't believe it.
*31:56.320- 32:02.040* :  I thought he was joking around or overexaggerating. Yeah, because when we go out, we like to have
*32:02.040- 32:06.640* :  some fun. Sometimes I'll joke on him. Sometimes he'll joke on me. So I just thought he was
*32:06.840- 32:12.280* :  just having some fun. So when he first told me, he's like, oh, it's money. I'm like, no way.
*32:12.800- 32:18.200* :  No, it's not. Were you able to just count it? Is it in good enough condition to just be able to
*32:18.460- 32:22.640* :  think how much have we got here or did you have to go through any kind of process to make the money
*32:22.640- 32:29.640* :  safe and able to be used? The money is actually so waterlogged. It is not usable at all. The NYPD
*32:29.640- 32:33.200* :  couldn't even take it in his evidence. We did call into the police because in New York City,
*32:33.200- 32:37.600* :  but when you find something like that, you have to let official know or you can actually be in trouble
*32:37.600- 32:41.680* :  if you take something like that. But it's very waterlogged. It's the size of money, but it's just
*32:41.720- 32:46.200* :  almost like a mushy pancake. It's completely black-covered in mud. Were you able to separate and look
*32:46.200- 32:50.980* :  inside and you see the security strips? Clearly, it's all $100 bills and it's very clear.
*32:50.980- 32:56.340* :  So you've been allowed to keep it, but are you going to be able to take advantage of it? Is the
*32:56.340- 33:00.960* :  money going to be usable? Are they going to reimburse you for the cash? Not right away. In
*33:00.960- 33:05.820* :  Washington, DC, it's where they have our bureau of engraving and printing where they create the money.
*33:06.020- 33:10.560* :  And it needs to be handed in by person or in mail, which I really don't trust mail. But we're
*33:10.660- 33:14.940* :  going to hopefully bring it to them and it could take up to three years, but they will rebuild
*33:14.940- 33:19.340* :  every single bill forensically. They go through it. They'll clean it. It takes a long time,
*33:19.340- 33:24.320* :  free of charge, but they will forensically find every serial number, even if it's in a shredder.
*33:24.520- 33:28.740* :  The American money will be rebuilt and they will cut us a check. So one day, Bobby, you are going
*33:28.740- 33:34.620* :  to be wealthy. Have you started spending it in your head yet? Yes, I have. I keep thinking of little
*33:34.620- 33:41.580* :  things here and there. Different ideas. I can spend it on. It's a weird concept, isn't it? To think
*33:41.580- 33:46.000* :  we know we're going to be rich, but we're going to wait three years. Yeah. Yeah, up to three years.
*33:46.000- 33:49.400* :  It could be six months, you know what I mean? It could be a quick job. I don't know. Yeah.
*33:49.840- 33:53.480* :  I mean, I'm presuming this is the best thing you've found magnet fishing, but I better check.
*33:53.480- 33:57.940* :  Oh, yeah. I would say so. Yeah, it's one of the greatest finds in history. Actually,
*33:57.940- 34:02.480* :  like with magnifatures, cash value wise. I mean, I know over there in England, some guys have found,
*34:02.480- 34:06.780* :  you know, swords and all that. That's beautiful history, but this is just straight American cash
*34:06.780- 34:11.640* :  value, which the history is awesome. But damn, money is pretty cool too. Of course it is. Yes.
*34:11.860- 34:15.320* :  I always wanted to search for treasure and I thought you'd have to be wealthy with a ship and
*34:15.320- 34:20.120* :  diving gear and tanks and all that. No, you just, you could find treasure your local pond. James
*34:20.120- 34:28.340* :  Kane and Barbie Agostini. And that's all from us for now. I'm off magnet fishing, but there will be
*34:28.340- 34:33.260* :  a new edition of the global news podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics
