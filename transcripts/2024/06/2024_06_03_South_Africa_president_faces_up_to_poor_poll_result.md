*01:23.840- 01:27.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:28.960- 01:33.700* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Monday, the third of June, these are our main stories.
*01:34.460- 01:39.200* :  South Africa's president makes it clear he intends to head a coalition government after the once
*01:39.200- 01:46.880* :  dominant ANC sees its support slump in elections. After his historic conviction, Donald Trump says he's
*01:46.880- 01:51.180* :  okay with going to jail, but he doesn't think the American public will stand for it.
*01:51.940- 01:57.600* :  Mexicans voting polls expected to produce the country's first female president after the most
*01:57.600- 02:06.380* :  violent campaign in living history. Also in this podcast, photos of Mr Murdoch's latest wedding were
*02:06.380- 02:12.220* :  published in the Sun newspaper. They show a smiling couple, her in a white dress, him in a blue
*02:12.300- 02:20.820* :  pair of trains. The media tycoon Rupert Murdoch marries for a fifth time at the age of 93.
*02:25.900- 02:32.540* :  President Cyril Ramiposa has described South Africa's election results as a victory for its democracy
*02:33.220- 02:39.420* :  despite his party losing its majority for the first time. The final result gave the party
*02:39.420- 02:47.980* :  he reads the ANC 159 seats in the 400 seat parliament. This represents a sharp drop in support,
*02:47.980- 02:54.080* :  and the ANC has started talks with other parties to form a coalition. The former president,
*02:54.080- 02:59.560* :  Jacob Zuma, did not attend the announcement of the final results on Sunday and has hinted that
*02:59.560- 03:05.340* :  he may challenge them. Our Africa correspondent Barbara Petasha reports from Johannesburg.
*03:08.260- 03:15.540* :  Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to the ceremony to announce
*03:15.660- 03:22.860* :  the results of the 2024 national and provincial elections. The official announcement of results
*03:22.860- 03:27.900* :  we already knew, the ceremony rubber stamping the decline of the African National Congress.
*03:28.900- 03:33.520* :  The president Cyril Ramiposa said the people had spoken, but he made a broader call for
*03:33.520- 03:39.220* :  political parties to find common ground in response, apparently preparing the ground for coalition talks.
*03:40.000- 03:46.260* :  What this election has made plain is that the people of South Africa expect their leaders
*03:47.600- 03:55.440* :  to work together to meet their needs. They expect the parties for which they have voted
*03:56.620- 04:04.280* :  to find common ground, to overcome their differences, to act and work together
*04:05.440- 04:10.700* :  for the good of everyone. That is what the people of South Africa have said.
*04:13.420- 04:18.940* :  Earlier today, the ANC met its disaster selection performance head on, the outcome of voter anger
*04:18.940- 04:24.620* :  over economic failures and corruption scandals. The Secretary General Fakirim Balula said the party
*04:24.620- 04:31.320* :  was not down and out, but there was nothing to celebrate. The results sent a clear message to the ANC.
*04:31.680- 04:38.080* :  We wish to assure the people of South Africa that we have heard their concerns, their frustrations,
*04:38.080- 04:44.160* :  and their dissatisfaction. And the election results show that we need to intensify and accelerate
*04:44.160- 04:51.320* :  the fundamental renewal of our movement. The clock on coalition talks starts now, not easy because
*04:51.320- 04:56.920* :  the weakened ANC will most likely have to share power with a major political rival. But which one?
*04:57.420- 04:59.940* :  Are you able to say what how coalition talks are going?
*05:00.780- 05:04.140* :  No, I don't just walk up and comment. It doesn't work that way.
*05:04.680- 05:09.440* :  This ANC official refused to drop any hints when I doorsteped him in the election result center.
*05:09.740- 05:15.760* :  And yeah, this has sent you here. So you shouldn't have to wake up and cut into a pin and continue.
*05:15.820- 05:17.840* :  No, I jump into every opportunity. That's what I do.
*05:19.740- 05:24.420* :  What we know is that the talks will be fraught with consequence because the major parties have
*05:24.420- 05:29.460* :  different visions for the country. The election is over, but South Africans are still waiting to see
*05:29.460- 05:30.940* :  how it impacts their nation.
*05:39.100- 05:41.300* :  That report by Barbara Plett Asher.
*05:42.420- 05:47.200* :  After his criminal conviction, the first for any former or sitting US President,
*05:47.200- 05:53.040* :  the consensus has been that Donald Trump probably won't go to jail for falsifying business records.
*05:53.800- 05:58.780* :  But now in what's being seen as a veiled threat, Mr. Trump has said he would accept a
*05:58.780- 06:04.980* :  sentence of house arrest or even jail time that he didn't think the American public would stand
*06:04.980- 06:11.340* :  for it. A senior Democrat Adam Schiff accused Mr. Trump of making what amounted to a dangerous
*06:11.340- 06:15.160* :  appeal to violence from Washington. Here's Will Vernon.
*06:16.040- 06:21.000* :  Most legal experts say it's unlikely Donald Trump will receive a prison sentence as he's a
*06:21.000- 06:27.120* :  first time offender convicted of a low level crime. But there is huge speculation here about whether
*06:27.120- 06:32.380* :  the judge could still decide to confine the former president to a jail cell. In an interview with
*06:32.380- 06:37.840* :  the conservative network Fox News, Mr. Trump was asked about the possibility of house arrest or prison.
*06:37.840- 06:43.080* :  I'm okay with it, he said, before adding, I don't know that the public would stand it, you know,
*06:43.340- 06:49.920* :  I'm not sure the public would stand for it with a house arrester. I think it would be tough for
*06:49.920- 06:53.020* :  the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there's a breaking point.
*06:53.100- 06:58.280* :  President Biden and his supporters have criticized the bellicose language used by Donald Trump
*06:58.280- 07:05.740* :  calling it reckless and dangerous. Will Vernon is already the bloodiest election in Mexico's modern
*07:05.740- 07:11.500* :  history after a campaign marked by violence and intimidation in which dozens of local candidates
*07:11.500- 07:17.280* :  have been murdered. Mexicans are choosing members of Congress, state governors and local officials
*07:17.280- 07:23.900* :  as well as a new president to replace Andrés Manuel López-Obrador. It's widely expected they
*07:23.900- 07:30.300* :  will elect Mexico's first female president as both of the leading candidates for that role are women.
*07:31.140- 07:37.000* :  In a country where around 10 women or girls are murdered each day, many regard this as a historic
*07:37.000- 07:42.880* :  breakthrough, including this voter, Monica Martinez, queuing outside a polling station in Mexico City.
*07:46.220- 07:50.700* :  The fact that people vote for a candidate who's a woman implies a lot of change at all levels,
*07:51.340- 07:56.080* :  that means it's already beginning to be good, but the fact that it's for a presidential candidate
*07:56.080- 08:04.000* :  is much more significant. Thousands of security personnel have been deployed to protect voters.
*08:04.460- 08:08.580* :  A correspondent will grant spoke to us from another polling station in Mexico City as people
*08:08.580- 08:13.460* :  cast their votes there. I've spent the morning at a polling station in Mexico City,
*08:14.220- 08:22.120* :  kind of an area which was very quiet, leafy, green, very orderly cues, not that much security,
*08:22.120- 08:27.280* :  although obviously police on hand and everything seemed to be going through very calmly and very well.
*08:27.680- 08:32.380* :  All three candidates, main candidates, particularly the two leading candidates, the women that you
*08:32.380- 08:36.300* :  spoke of, they're cloudier, shame bound for the governing party and such a tall gal-vezz for
*08:36.300- 08:41.620* :  an opposition coalition. They've all cast their votes in Mexico City, too, as has President
*08:41.620- 08:48.160* :  Andrés Manuel López Obrador. But that's not to paint the picture as uniformly calm across
*08:48.160- 08:53.500* :  the country. There are, unfortunately, areas where people simply won't be able to vote down in
*08:53.500- 09:00.680* :  Chiapas. At least two municipalities have had to suspend the vote because of cartel-related
*09:00.680- 09:06.560* :  violence, including masked gunmen going into the electoral offices of one municipality,
*09:07.220- 09:12.600* :  setting it on fire, and obviously all of the ballot papers were in the building at the time,
*09:12.600- 09:17.360* :  and they're all lost, so the entire election in that town has had to be suspended.
*09:17.920- 09:22.540* :  And can you just explain to us why there has been so much violence in this election?
*09:24.380- 09:27.660* :  Why it's particularly bad this time is a hard one to answer. I mean,
*09:28.280- 09:33.160* :  the tractors of the President would say is because he simply doesn't have a handle on crime and
*09:33.160- 09:39.820* :  insecurity in Mexico. I think other people, his supporters would say he's inherited a very,
*09:39.820- 09:46.440* :  very bad situation that he stabilized it somehow and that even little by little is beginning
*09:46.440- 09:51.660* :  to make inroads on the murder rate. But I think the truth be told this is a very violent election,
*09:51.660- 09:57.020* :  the most violent in living memory. And it's just simply the case that the cartels
*09:57.460- 10:02.820* :  are making their stamp on this vote, they're making their presence known, whether or not that's
*10:02.820- 10:07.740* :  through the murder of the candidates, which is obviously awful, but also the intimidation,
*10:07.740- 10:14.520* :  the forcing candidates off the ballot, the placing of gunmen near and around polling stations,
*10:14.520- 10:20.640* :  the instructions alleged instructions to vote for certain parties, and so on and so forth.
*10:20.740- 10:24.360* :  So yeah, it's been a terrible vote in those days, a terrible campaign.
*10:25.660- 10:30.600* :  And whoever wins, will it make much difference? Is there much between the two leading contenders?
*10:31.420- 10:36.780* :  Well, it'll make a difference in terms of, you know, the political vision of the two sides that
*10:36.780- 10:43.320* :  are very, very opposed in terms of tagging security, both women face an extremely difficult
*10:43.320- 10:49.460* :  and challenging task. We'll grant to Mexico. Two days after President Biden unexpectedly
*10:49.460- 10:54.920* :  unveiled what he said was a new Israeli peace plan for Gaza, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*10:54.920- 11:00.940* :  Netanyahu is coming under pressure from all sides, even as he appears to be pouring cold water
*11:00.940- 11:06.080* :  on the deal. The U.S. criticism of the high death toll in Gaza is intensifying.
*11:06.500- 11:10.740* :  Relatives of hostages held there are calling on him to accept this latest plan,
*11:10.740- 11:15.600* :  but two far-right ministers have threatened to bring down his coalition if he does.
*11:16.340- 11:20.440* :  An aide to Mr. Netanyahu confirmed that Israel had accepted the framework
*11:20.440- 11:24.540* :  being put forward by Mr. Biden, but described it as flawed.
*11:25.180- 11:29.980* :  And a senior member of the Knesset for the Prime Minister's liquid party, Hanok Milwitzky,
*11:29.980- 11:32.920* :  so the current plan did not go far enough.
*11:33.560- 11:40.920* :  The coalition is not divided on this at all. The Biden proposal, as was mentioned in his Friday
*11:40.920- 11:45.980* :  speech, is completely unacceptable on the entire part of the coalition.
*11:46.180- 11:52.460* :  The Israeli proposal that has been on the table for almost two weeks now is talking about
*11:52.460- 11:58.360* :  a not-up permanent ceasefire, but a temporary ceasefire in order to release hostages,
*11:58.360- 12:06.300* :  and then start negotiation to see what would be the outcome of the end result in Gaza.
*12:06.300- 12:10.340* :  The demands of the Israeli government has not changed.
*12:10.340- 12:15.560* :  That means Hamas can no longer rule Gaza, can no longer have any capability,
*12:15.640- 12:21.800* :  not military, not any civilian capability to be in power,
*12:22.100- 12:24.700* :  and all the hostages need to come back.
*12:24.700- 12:31.360* :  The war will not stop until these demands are met, and we will accept no other terms.
*12:32.500- 12:37.160* :  We got more on this confusing situation from our Middle East correspondent Yuga Beshege in
*12:37.160- 12:43.680* :  Jerusalem. Beja Minutaniya, who seems to be caught between two options, ceasefire or coalition.
*12:44.580- 12:49.600* :  Unsurprisingly, two of his far-right ministers have rejected a plan for the war in Gaza,
*12:49.960- 12:54.360* :  which was laid out by President Biden. Describing the deal as unacceptable,
*12:54.360- 13:00.980* :  the Finance Minister Bezalus Motrich, and Eta Mabengavir, Israel's National Security Minister,
*13:01.380- 13:06.120* :  have threatened to quit if it goes ahead. This could lead to the collapse of the coalition.
*13:06.940- 13:11.080* :  The head of the opposition has offered to support the government if the ministers do resign,
*13:11.520- 13:16.060* :  which would make Mr. Netanyahu dependent on people who have been highly critical of them.
*13:16.820- 13:20.280* :  He hasn't responded yet. Since the proposal was announced on Friday,
*13:20.280- 13:24.860* :  Mr. Netanyahu's office has only issued two statements, short and vague,
*13:24.860- 13:30.620* :  without explicitly supporting the deal, which President Biden described as an Israeli proposal.
*13:31.120- 13:35.940* :  The families of the hostages are holding another protest outside Mr. Netanyahu's office
*13:35.940- 13:41.940* :  in Jerusalem to urge him to support the plan. Hamas has said it will accept the proposal
*13:42.380- 13:48.020* :  if Israel does. Yuga Beshege, and staying with Gaza, as the fighting
*13:48.020- 13:53.560* :  there continues, the UN humanitarian news service relief web has said there's been a sharp rise
*13:53.560- 13:59.700* :  in the number of people with disabilities in Gaza, and the circumstances of those who are
*13:59.700- 14:05.680* :  already disabled have worsened further. The BBC's Disability and Mental Health Podcast
*14:05.680- 14:11.860* :  access all recently managed to speak to an 18-year-old woman, Bushrah, who has muscular
*14:11.860- 14:17.700* :  dystrophy. She's been on a move like thousands of other people, and she's been telling her story
*14:17.700- 14:29.260* :  from De Albala to Alex Collins. Before the war, things were different. It wasn't easy.
*14:29.820- 14:35.180* :  There was no support for people with my condition, especially in school. I could only go to
*14:35.180- 14:41.620* :  classes on the ground floor as I couldn't use the stairs. But my dad adapted the house to help
*14:41.620- 14:47.660* :  with my condition. There were handrails need the toilet and more handrails to help move me when
*14:47.660- 14:53.620* :  I wanted to get around the house. So life was hard before the war, but things got even harder?
*14:54.140- 15:02.940* :  Absolutely. I had to leave my house in the east of Jabalya in the first month of the war.
*15:03.560- 15:09.780* :  After evacuation orders were given to head south. I now live in a tent with 20 people,
*15:10.360- 15:17.240* :  which is difficult because I can't lean on the plastic edges of it as it won't take my weight.
*15:18.300- 15:25.560* :  I need wheelchair to go to the toilet, and I need people to help me. It's been very, very hard to
*15:25.560- 15:33.060* :  get one. I was borrowing a wheelchair from someone else, but I lost it. And so now I am borrowing
*15:33.060- 15:39.540* :  another one from some other people. When they let me use it, that is, which is not often.
*15:40.400- 15:46.880* :  I'm telling my story on a crowdfunding page. A go fund me website to help myself and my
*15:46.880- 15:54.360* :  family. The situation is very serious, and I could die at any time. I want to raise enough
*15:54.360- 16:01.140* :  money to live raza. Once I get the money, I'll get a wheelchair. It sounds very loud where you are.
*16:04.700- 16:11.540* :  It's always noisy. The drones, the bombings, the fighting. It's obviously not great,
*16:11.540- 16:17.920* :  but what can we do? We've got use to it. We might have to move. We are in there in Bela.
*16:17.920- 16:24.180* :  But we might have to move to Hanyunis. It's hard to move from one place to another. I have to have
*16:24.180- 16:31.500* :  help from my family. I had to go to the hospital last month to get my heart checked as it's affected
*16:31.500- 16:38.620* :  by my condition. The war just made everything more stressful. I've had no support the past seven
*16:38.620- 16:45.800* :  months, nothing from any of the aid agencies. Do you know other people with disabilities? What have
*16:51.480- 16:55.500* :  they been telling you? There are lots of people now in raza with disabilities, people who've lost
*16:55.500- 17:02.740* :  limbs, their hands and their legs. They need things like prosthetics and walking sticks, but in raza
*17:02.740- 17:08.760* :  they're hard to find. Bush writes speaking to Alex Collins, and if you want to hear more on this,
*17:08.760- 17:17.420* :  just search for access all on BBC sounds. China has long insisted it's neutral in Ukraine war,
*17:17.420- 17:21.700* :  despite the US alleging that it's helping Moscow by sending it components for weapons.
*17:22.580- 17:27.960* :  Now, President Zelensky has accused China of attempting to undermine his upcoming global
*17:27.960- 17:33.660* :  peace summit in Switzerland. Mr. Zelensky said China was not only refusing to take part,
*17:33.660- 17:38.420* :  but was along with Russia trying to stop other countries from attending. He was speaking at an
*17:38.420- 17:44.320* :  Asian security forum in Singapore. Our reporter, Serena Tawari, listened to what he had to say.
*17:44.960- 17:49.840* :  Vladimir Zelensky stole the show at the summit, attended by defence chiefs from around the world,
*17:50.400- 17:55.840* :  arriving almost unannounced to applause and a packed lobby. As he addressed delegates on the
*17:55.840- 18:01.420* :  final day, he talked of the need for support for his vision of peace, starting with a summit in
*18:01.420- 18:07.360* :  Switzerland later this month. Mr. Zelensky said it would focus on achieving nuclear security,
*18:07.360- 18:13.220* :  food security, and the release of prisoners of war and Ukrainian children held in Russia.
*18:13.820- 18:20.420* :  He said 106 countries had signed up, but he said Russia was trying to dissuade other states
*18:20.420- 18:24.600* :  from attending the event, and that China was working to do so as well.
*18:24.860- 18:31.360* :  We are disappointed that some world leaders have not yet confirmed their participation in the
*18:31.360- 18:38.300* :  peace summit. Unfortunately, there are also attempts to disrupt the summit. We do not want to believe
*18:38.300- 18:45.180* :  that this is a desire for monopolistic power in the world to deny the global community, the
*18:45.180- 18:53.180* :  opportunity to decide on war and peace and to live these power in the hands of one or two.
*18:53.620- 18:59.280* :  China says it has not taken sides in the Ukraine war, but the failure to invite Russia to
*18:59.280- 19:03.320* :  the Swiss meeting undermined its usefulness as a peace forum.
*19:04.180- 19:05.440* :  Serena Tawari
*19:06.320- 19:12.340* :  Rupert Murdoch has married for a fifth time at a ceremony in California. The 93-year-old
*19:12.340- 19:18.120* :  media tycoon and his new wife, the retired scientist Yelena Chukova, celebrated their marriage
*19:18.440- 19:22.080* :  at his vineyard with family and friends. Joe Inwood reports.
*19:23.100- 19:27.600* :  Rupert Murdoch built one of the world's most powerful media empires. Newscorp and Foxcorp
*19:27.600- 19:32.980* :  are worth billions, but his marriages have never been quite as successful as his businesses.
*19:33.920- 19:39.460* :  His first to the flight attendant and model Patricia Booker lasted 11 years. They had one daughter
*19:39.460- 19:45.860* :  Prudence, but divorced in 1967. Next was the Scottish journalist Anna Tawth, to whom he was married
*19:45.860- 19:51.660* :  for 32 years. She was working at one of his newspapers and had requested an interview with him.
*19:51.660- 19:58.680* :  They have three children, Elizabeth, Lachlan and James. That ended when he met Wendy Deng in 1999.
*19:58.940- 20:04.880* :  She too was an employee of Mr Murdoch, working for Hong Kong-based Star TV. They got married
*20:04.880- 20:10.460* :  aboard his yacht, Morning Glory. Wendy Deng famously defended her husband from a pie-throwing
*20:10.460- 20:14.840* :  protester at a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking by his companies.
*20:22.220- 20:27.740* :  Then came Jerry Hall, the ex-partner of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger. The supermodel reportedly
*20:27.740- 20:32.960* :  learned of the end of their marriage via email. Last spring, he announced his engagement to Anne
*20:32.960- 20:38.260* :  Leslie Smith, before calling it off two weeks later because she was said to be too religious,
*20:38.260- 20:44.460* :  which brings us to the fifth Mrs Murdoch. Elena Zukova is a retired Russian molecular biologist.
*20:44.460- 20:50.500* :  She was also previously married to Russian oil billionaire Alexander Zukov, while their daughter
*20:50.500- 20:55.620* :  Dasha, a socialite and business woman, was married to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.
*20:56.200- 21:02.280* :  Photos of Mr Murdoch's latest wedding were published in the Sun newspaper. They show a smiling couple,
*21:02.280- 21:08.000* :  her in a white dress, him in a blue suit and a pair of trainers. The paper, which of course he
*21:08.000- 21:13.320* :  owns, said they celebrated their big day with delighted relatives at a ceremony blessed with
*21:13.320- 21:18.200* :  blue skies and warm sunshine. The ups and downs of Mr Murdoch's love life have sometimes
*21:18.200- 21:23.860* :  resembled the tabloid stories that help fuel his empire. He'll be hoping that this time around,
*21:23.900- 21:30.600* :  it's a happy ending. Joey Murdoch. Still to come?
*21:31.080- 21:36.280* :  If you look at the pictures, if you see any footage of the island, it's completely overcrowded,
*21:36.280- 21:42.780* :  it's very small, maximum half a kilometer. Why residents of a small island off the coast of Panama
*21:43.120- 21:44.700* :  are relocating to the mainland?
*21:50.640- 21:54.860* :  A lot can happen in the next three years, like a chatbot may be your new best friend,
*21:54.860- 21:58.540* :  but what won't change? Meeting health insurance? United health care

*22:55.160- 22:59.020* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast. Member states of the World Health
*22:59.020- 23:04.440* :  Organization have agreed to keep alive negotiations on a pandemic treaty for another year.
*23:05.040- 23:10.540* :  The talks have been complicated by strong disagreements, especially about how to share vaccines.
*23:10.540- 23:16.960* :  From Geneva, here's image in folks. The World Health Organization pushed hard for this treaty,
*23:17.020- 23:25.580* :  hoping the trauma of COVID-19, 7 million dead, huge economic damage, and the misery of lockdowns
*23:25.820- 23:32.160* :  would spur countries to act. But deep divisions remain, especially over vaccine sharing.
*23:32.880- 23:39.640* :  Finally, countries agreed to extend the negotiations by one year, and they agreed to update
*23:39.640- 23:45.480* :  existing international health regulations. With a new category of pandemic emergency,
*23:46.100- 23:49.780* :  aimed at strengthening the global response to new health risks.
*23:50.460- 23:56.740* :  Image in folks. It's a striking aerial image. A tiny island crammed with hundreds of homes with
*23:56.740- 24:02.560* :  only the odd tree poking up here and there and a couple of narrow roads. Now hundreds of residents
*24:02.580- 24:09.000* :  of Gardi Soudoub, of Panama's Caribbean coast, are packing up their belongings because of climate
*24:09.000- 24:14.860* :  change. With many of their houses only half a meter above sea level, residents have been offered
*24:14.860- 24:19.760* :  the chance to relocate to the mainland where new homes have been built for them, and it's thought
*24:19.760- 24:24.980* :  that other communities could soon follow. Our American Senator Leonardo Russia told us more.
*24:25.600- 24:30.760* :  If you look at the pictures, if you see any footage of the island, it's completely overcrowded.
*24:30.760- 24:37.940* :  It's very small, maximum half a kilometer, one direction, and 150 meters on the other direction,
*24:37.980- 24:43.340* :  and they have two problems there. The problem of overcrowding and finding space,
*24:43.980- 24:47.840* :  and they have the problem of rising seas because it's just off the coast of Panama.
*24:48.380- 24:54.340* :  Most houses are about half a meter to one meter above sea level, and what they've noticed is that
*24:54.340- 24:59.820* :  for a long time. Now, in the rainy season, the houses have been flooded more and more often.
*25:00.240- 25:04.520* :  So, they've been asking the government to replace them. They say, we can't stay here.
*25:04.900- 25:10.540* :  Residents have also mentioned the problem with this waste disposal and lack of water.
*25:10.720- 25:16.720* :  So, life hasn't become practical for them, basically, unsustainable, and the Guna people,
*25:16.720- 25:24.220* :  they came from what is now northern Colombia, and when Panama became independent from Colombia,
*25:24.220- 25:30.960* :  they moved to that region about 200 years ago to the islands, and now they're moving to the mainland.
*25:31.320- 25:36.500* :  Where exactly are they going to go, and how do they feel about being uprooted in this way?
*25:36.720- 25:41.640* :  It's interesting because when I read about it, I thought they would be very angry, but no,
*25:41.640- 25:47.360* :  they're very excited. Most of the people who are excited about it, they said they couldn't stay there.
*25:47.360- 25:52.040* :  They say, it's practical problems. They say the houses are too small. It's overcrowded. The
*25:52.040- 25:58.220* :  children have no space to play, and they helped the government develop this new area,
*25:58.660- 26:04.820* :  which is just in land. When you go in land, it's a jungle area, and they help design the houses
*26:04.820- 26:11.540* :  in the traditional ways that they like, or close by, where the communities can be together.
*26:12.140- 26:17.080* :  It's very interesting because it's a story of climate change, where you imagine that people
*26:17.600- 26:23.780* :  will be very angry about the way of life. They earn a lot, they're living through agriculture,
*26:23.780- 26:28.340* :  that they will continue to do, fishing, which they probably will, if they're not far from the
*26:28.340- 26:34.400* :  coast and tourism, which might continue. But what is interesting is that these families are
*26:34.400- 26:38.180* :  very excited with the new changes, the new life that they will have there.
*26:38.340- 26:42.660* :  And campaign groups are calling these people some of the first climate change refugees of the
*26:42.660- 26:48.800* :  Americas, but there are expected to be many more communities who will be relocated this way
*26:49.360- 26:56.100* :  at great cost to governments. Yes, of course, these Guna Indigenous people, they inhabit another
*26:56.100- 27:03.160* :  50 islands, more or less, in the same region. I mean, they probably are not as overcrowded as
*27:03.160- 27:08.380* :  the one that they're being abandoned now. But this is a problem coming to the whole of the Caribbean,
*27:08.460- 27:13.860* :  where most islands are very low, close to the sea. What the scientists are saying is,
*27:13.860- 27:19.120* :  this is a good example, but it's in a very small scale. How are you going to move inland
*27:19.120- 27:25.400* :  whole populations? And not only that, you have to also take into account landslides, rivers
*27:25.400- 27:31.300* :  that might also flood. It's a huge effort, and this is only a tiny, a good example, but it
*27:31.300- 27:36.420* :  doesn't reflect the scale of the problem coming in the next 10, 20, 30 years.
*27:37.300- 27:43.480* :  Leonardo Rosha. China says it successfully landed an uncrewed craft on the far side of the moon.
*27:43.480- 27:48.760* :  The mission aims to collect precious rock and soil from the region for the first time in history.
*27:48.760- 27:53.980* :  The craft touched down in a huge crater known as the South Pole Aiken Basin.
*27:54.440- 27:59.860* :  The European Space Agency has a role in the operation. Paul Henley spoke to Neil Melville,
*27:59.920- 28:04.100* :  a technical officer with ease at admission control in Beijing, and began by asking him about
*28:04.100- 28:09.600* :  the moment of touchdown on the moon. Of course, everyone around us was very excited at the moment
*28:09.640- 28:14.700* :  of the landing. It's not their first time. It's in fact their fourth time landing on the moon,
*28:14.700- 28:19.860* :  so they've clearly got quite good at it now, but immediately back to work because there's an awful
*28:19.860- 28:26.440* :  lot to do. And what is the significance of this particular landing? Well, this mission is attempting
*28:26.440- 28:32.660* :  to retrieve some samples from the far side of the moon, which would be a first, no one's ever done
*28:32.660- 28:38.320* :  this before. The far side of the moon is actually made of quite different rock than the near side
*28:38.320- 28:44.120* :  that we can see, and it's quite a lot older, and it should tell us a lot more about the formation
*28:44.120- 28:49.640* :  of the moon and of the solar system in general, so it's really a kind of scientific treasure trove.
*28:50.000- 28:54.240* :  And a definite advance on the samples that they could get from the near side?
*28:54.560- 28:58.540* :  Yes, just because the nature of them is different, but also it's a technological advance.
*28:58.560- 29:02.760* :  It's quite a lot harder to operate a mission on the far side of the moon for the simple fact
*29:02.760- 29:07.440* :  that the moon is in the way, so you can't have direct line of communication. You need to use
*29:07.440- 29:13.020* :  relay satellites, which adds a whole level of technological complexity. Tell us about your role
*29:13.060- 29:16.260* :  in this project. It's significant, isn't it? What you're working on?
*29:16.480- 29:23.780* :  CNSA, the Chinese National Space Agency, they invited international partners to propose payloads
*29:23.840- 29:29.400* :  to join them on the Chang'a 6 mission, and I work for the European Space Agency,
*29:29.920- 29:35.900* :  and we have joined them with a payload called negative ions on the lunar surface, NILS,
*29:37.060- 29:41.420* :  which, just as the name suggests, is looking to detect negative ions on the lunar surface.
*29:41.980- 29:46.480* :  These are the things that should be kicked up by the solar wind impacting on the moon,
*29:46.480- 29:50.300* :  because the moon doesn't have a magnetic field to shield it the way the Earth does,
*29:50.900- 29:53.320* :  which is why we don't see auroras on the moon, but we do see them here.
*29:53.540- 29:59.000* :  Our science has very good models. We think we hope of what should be happening on the lunar
*29:59.000- 30:04.140* :  surface when this occurs, but no one's ever measured it directly. We need to measure it
*30:04.360- 30:08.920* :  on the surface in situ to find out if our scientific understanding is correct
*30:09.360- 30:14.220* :  of the solar wind, of how that interacts with planetary bodies that don't have any magnetic shield.
*30:14.960- 30:20.040* :  But also because that would inform us about the environment on the surface for future missions,
*30:20.040- 30:26.000* :  for robotic missions, for crewed missions, we need to know what the population of ions is there,
*30:26.440- 30:31.240* :  the charges, the type of plasma, etc, because we're going to design equipment and take people
*30:31.240- 30:36.340* :  to live and work there. You're working hand in hand with the Chinese and being in mission control,
*30:36.900- 30:44.080* :  seems to negate some of the talk of the space race and the jealously guarded secrets of the Chinese
*30:44.080- 30:51.240* :  mission. As I say, CNSA invited international cooperation. There is indeed an acceleration
*30:51.280- 30:58.160* :  lately in missions to the moon and the Chinese themselves are going very fast. We can only
*30:58.580- 31:04.760* :  congratulate them for their astonishing achievements. Of course, ESA was founded on the principle
*31:04.760- 31:08.520* :  of international cooperation. We have 27 member states and associate member states.
*31:09.020- 31:12.280* :  We've known for a very long time that the hole is greater than some of its parts,
*31:13.180- 31:17.020* :  and that's not just true to European level. Of course, that's true at a global level.
*31:17.020- 31:21.700* :  So we're very happy to be invited to be involved. It's great to collaborate and we can achieve
*31:21.700- 31:25.140* :  more together like that. So you don't think the world, and particularly the West,
*31:25.140- 31:30.420* :  has anything to fear from China's resurgence space program. There's been speculation about
*31:30.420- 31:35.040* :  China exploring, well actually about everybody, exploring military opportunity in space.
*31:35.560- 31:42.080* :  This mission is purely scientific. I see no other component to it. Science inherently should be
*31:42.080- 31:46.980* :  for the good of everyone and a peaceful endeavor. Of course, I wouldn't like to think of it as a race
*31:46.980- 31:50.880* :  where we're competing with each other, but it should be a journey that we're trying to go on
*31:50.920- 31:57.620* :  together. And if the achievements of one agency or one nation inspire the greater efforts of
*31:57.620- 32:02.980* :  another, then that's all to the good as far as I'm concerned. Neil Melville, a technical officer
*32:02.980- 32:08.920* :  with the European Space Agency. One of the most successful rugby league players in history.
*32:08.920- 32:15.100* :  Rob Barrow has died at the age of 41. The lead's rhinos player was diagnosed with
*32:15.100- 32:22.980* :  motor neurone disease in 2019 just two years after his retirement. He raised millions to help others
*32:22.980- 32:28.300* :  with the same condition. A rugby league correspondent, Matt Newsom, looks back at his life.
*32:31.500- 32:37.740* :  Brave, dazzling, defiant and humble. Four words that encapsulate perfectly the remarkable
*32:37.740- 32:43.100* :  Rob Barrow. The tiny boy in ill-fitting padding, playing rugby league in his hometown of
*32:43.100- 32:49.480* :  Castleford, became a giant of his sport despite his diminutive figure. Eight grand final rings,
*32:49.480- 32:54.460* :  two challenge cups and three world club challenge honors came with the lead's rhinos,
*32:54.760- 33:00.860* :  whom he supported avidly like his father, Jeff. He realised those dreams and represented his
*33:00.860- 33:07.420* :  country too. Rob Barrow was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019. He opened up his story
*33:07.420- 33:14.100* :  to the public and with it captured hearts and minds. He was a terrific player and a man who inspired
*33:14.100- 33:21.400* :  millions. Matt Newsom, with that look back on the life of Rob Barrow, who has died at the age of 41.
*33:23.080- 33:28.200* :  And now to the story of another inspiring figure, a British woman who was told she would not
*33:28.200- 33:35.380* :  live past the age of 16. Sophie Holmes has cystic fibrosis, a condition which causes the lungs
*33:35.380- 33:41.720* :  to produce excessive amounts of mucus. Well, she's defied the medical establishment in style.
*33:41.720- 33:50.240* :  She's just set a world record for running 36 marathons in 36 days. Think about that for a moment.
*33:50.240- 33:57.760* :  cystic fibrosis often causes severe respiratory problems and yet Sophie is a long distance runner.
*33:58.160- 34:02.440* :  She told us how she started. To give some context, when I was 19,
*34:03.440- 34:08.620* :  obviously surpassing the original prediction of my health, I did actually become really unwell and
*34:09.440- 34:14.200* :  they did say then, well, you might only have a couple of years left. And I sat there as a 19-year-old
*34:14.800- 34:18.880* :  with the power of naivety going, no, I don't believe you. We can do something about this.
*34:19.820- 34:25.620* :  And so started running. So started running a lot more training and I promised myself if I made
*34:25.620- 34:32.380* :  30, I wanted to celebrate. But when I made 30, it was locked down and the goal of running 30
*34:32.380- 34:37.560* :  marathons in 30 days wasn't possible. And so I thought, okay, well, we're benched to idea and see
*34:37.560- 34:42.520* :  what happens. Last year, I entered the letter of a marathon, I got into the London mouth and I
*34:42.520- 34:47.100* :  thought, hang on a minute, how many days are between these two races. And that's where the 36 was born.
*34:47.100- 34:52.400* :  It was kind of a random number due to a circumstance, but I was like, what's a few more, you know?
*34:52.720- 34:57.360* :  My dad was the crew for 33 of them and he was fantastic. And I was fortunate enough that
*34:57.360- 35:01.680* :  come rain or shine, he was standing there somewhere on route in his high years, ready to give me some
*35:01.680- 35:07.060* :  water and things. And so that was a really special moment finishing them with him. And I guess
*35:07.060- 35:10.660* :  if I was going to put anything out there, anyone, it would just be just don't give up, like,
*35:11.660- 35:17.000* :  don't stop going after your goals, even if things are hard, because I'm a firm believer of,
*35:17.260- 35:21.800* :  you know, things are possible if you just keep going, 1% a day, keep pushing because
*35:22.440- 35:26.360* :  when obviously I was younger, I got told I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't achieve anything,
*35:26.360- 35:31.780* :  so what's the point? And I fought back against that. And so by me doing this, I'm hoping that I
*35:31.780- 35:36.960* :  would provide hope to families with CF people with CF or people facing hard times or adversity,
*35:38.160- 35:42.460* :  but also inspire people just to go after those goals because we really only have one shot of
