*01:30.040- 01:34.960* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 24th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:35.300- 01:40.540* :  The number of dead in the Southern Russian Republic of Dagestan rises to at least 20
*01:40.540- 01:46.320* :  after gunmen, attack, churches, and synagogues. 22 people, including migrant workers,
*01:46.320- 01:50.840* :  have been killed in a huge fire at a lithium battery factory in South Korea.
*01:51.400- 01:57.140* :  Princess Anne, the sister of King Charles, has been admitted to hospital in England after an
*01:57.140- 02:04.620* :  incident with a horse. Also in this podcast, a former Philippine government minister has been
*02:04.620- 02:09.720* :  cleared of all the drug charges that were brought against her during the term of the former president
*02:09.720- 02:16.260* :  Rodrigo Deterte. And seizure wise, we have seen a massive improvement and just overall,
*02:16.260- 02:22.120* :  we're seeing a much better quality of life, I think. We see the results of a pioneering treatment for
*02:22.120- 02:30.480* :  epilepsy. The number of dead in the Southern Russian Republic of Dagestan has risen to at least
*02:30.480- 02:37.660* :  20, including 15 police officers and four civilians. The attacks late on Sunday targeted churches
*02:37.660- 02:45.080* :  and synagogues in Makhachkala and Durbent. Investigators say five gunmen were killed and later
*02:45.080- 02:51.920* :  identified. Dagestan's governor is Sergei Milikov. Of course, we understand who is behind
*02:51.920- 02:58.380* :  the organizational these terrorist attacks. We understand what the organizers were trying to
*02:58.380- 03:03.440* :  achieve. Subsequent operational search and investigative measures will be carried out
*03:03.800- 03:08.960* :  until all participants in this sleeper cells are identified. And of course, there had been
*03:08.960- 03:15.040* :  preparing for this, including from abroad. President Putin has been keen to downplay the extent of
*03:15.040- 03:20.620* :  Islamist violence in Russia. In its first comments, the Kremlin has dismissed the possibility of another
*03:20.620- 03:25.820* :  wave of violence in the North Caucasus, which has previously seen a spate of Islamist attacks.
*03:25.900- 03:31.240* :  But that's becoming an increasingly difficult line to hold, as I heard from our Russia editor,
*03:31.240- 03:37.480* :  Steve Rosenberg, who first gave me the latest on these attacks. So let's go back to late yesterday
*03:37.480- 03:44.340* :  afternoon, Sunday afternoon. This seems to be in a coordinated attack on two cities in Dagestan,
*03:44.800- 03:50.460* :  in Russia's North Caucasus region. The cities of Durbent and Makhachkala, attacks on two churches
*03:51.040- 03:57.820* :  and on two synagogues and also on a police checkpoint. And the gun battle between the attackers and
*03:57.820- 04:02.060* :  the security forces went on long into the night. And we're talking something like eight hours
*04:02.060- 04:08.760* :  it went on. This morning, the local authorities there declared the so-called anti-terrorist operation
*04:08.780- 04:16.400* :  over and said that at least 15 police officers had been killed, four civilians, and saying, well,
*04:16.400- 04:21.940* :  some figures suggest five gunmen, others six, were killed. That's the latest on what happened.
*04:22.360- 04:28.400* :  Now, we heard from Sergey Malikov, the Dagestan governor there in that clip. He's also saying
*04:28.400- 04:33.680* :  that we know who was behind this. It was organized from a broad Dagestan. It is now directly
*04:33.680- 04:40.280* :  involved in Russia's war in Ukraine. What's your take on those comments? Well, he sort of suggested
*04:40.280- 04:46.320* :  that. He mentioned the so-called special military operation code for Russia's war in Ukraine.
*04:46.460- 04:51.600* :  He said we know who was behind this. He didn't actually spell it out. He didn't name names.
*04:51.660- 04:57.940* :  But there is a strong suspicion that this is linked to radical Islam. If you think that if
*04:57.940- 05:03.700* :  you go back to the early 2000s onwards, Russian security forces were battling an Islamist
*05:03.700- 05:09.360* :  insurgency in Dagestan. And in fact, in recent years, the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility
*05:09.360- 05:15.880* :  for a string of attacks that took place in Dagestan. I can remember one in 2018 outside a church
*05:16.640- 05:22.480* :  when five worshippers were killed. However, the Russian authorities, and this includes Mr.
*05:22.480- 05:28.800* :  Malikov, seem extremely reluctant to talk about radical Islam. And that is because I think that
*05:28.800- 05:34.220* :  ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russians, the Russian public, has been led to
*05:34.220- 05:40.140* :  believe that the biggest threat, the biggest danger to them, to their security, comes from Kiev,
*05:40.140- 05:45.060* :  and comes from what's known here as the collective west, not radical Islam. That is the official
*05:45.180- 05:50.400* :  message, if you like, the official narrative that's put out to people. And there seems to be a
*05:50.400- 05:55.560* :  reluctance to talk publicly about the Islamist threat. I think that is because there's a concern
*05:55.560- 06:00.260* :  here that if the authorities start to do that, then people will start to wonder what hang on.
*06:00.860- 06:07.380* :  If the Islamist threat is real and large, why has Russia been spending all its resources,
*06:07.380- 06:15.000* :  all its energy for the last two and a half years, fighting Ukraine, and not focusing on the Islamist
*06:15.000- 06:21.540* :  threat? Steve Rosenberg. At least 22 people have been killed in a large fire that broke out
*06:21.540- 06:27.780* :  at a lithium battery factory near the South Korean capital Seoul. The first service said 18 of them
*06:27.780- 06:33.580* :  were Chinese nationals. Eight others are injured too critically. The search and rescue operation
*06:33.580- 06:38.880* :  is ongoing. Lithium battery is a highly flammable, and the resulting blaze is difficult to control
*06:38.880- 06:45.100* :  with conventional fire extinguishing methods. A local TV station captured the sound of explosions
*06:45.100- 06:48.600* :  from the site as dark smoke poured out of the building's roof.
*06:53.340- 06:58.920* :  Well, our reporter Rachel Lee is in Seoul, and she told me more. A massive factory fire happened
*06:58.920- 07:05.300* :  on Monday morning at the aerosol plant in Pasang City, which is just about 28 miles south
*07:05.300- 07:11.780* :  of the capital Seoul. The blaze broke out after several lithium batteries exploded, which led to
*07:11.780- 07:20.340* :  at least 22 deaths, and these include 24-in-workers. The aerosol factory housed an estimated 35,000
*07:20.340- 07:26.100* :  battery cells on its second floor, where the batteries were inspected and packaged with more
*07:26.100- 07:32.200* :  stored elsewhere. Now, local fire official Kim Jong-un said the fire began when a series of
*07:32.200- 07:37.440* :  battery cells exploded, though it remains unclear what triggered the initial explosions.
*07:37.580- 07:43.820* :  About 100 workers were on the premises at the time. As lithium fire can react intensely with
*07:43.820- 07:49.620* :  water, firefighters had to use dry sand to extinguish the blaze, which took several hours to get
*07:49.620- 07:55.380* :  under control. You mentioned Rachel that the vet is still out as to what causes fire, whether or not
*07:55.380- 07:59.560* :  they exploded. What kind of safety record do these kind of factories have?
*07:59.780- 08:06.680* :  It is under investigation what kind of fire cautions they had or other measures were taken,
*08:06.680- 08:12.360* :  but this fire was mainly because of the lithium. South Korea is a leading producer of lithium
*08:12.360- 08:17.900* :  batteries, and these are usually used in electric vehicles worldwide. The lithium batteries are
*08:17.900- 08:23.540* :  just at risk of exploding if they're damaged or overheated, and while a fire can be extinguished,
*08:23.540- 08:28.200* :  it remains at risk of reigniting without warning due to the chemical reaction.
*08:28.200- 08:34.300* :  Now, this is not the first time, though. Last September, in Australia, a major fire broke out of
*08:34.300- 08:40.740* :  Tesla's Megapack. And in 2021, the fire also occurred out of Megapack battery in Victoria,
*08:40.740- 08:45.220* :  Australia, so the danger remains for lithium battery plants.
*08:46.220- 08:52.420* :  That was Rachel Lee. At least 65 people have died after a week of torrential rain that
*08:52.420- 08:56.860* :  battered southern China, triggering mudslides and flash floods there.
*08:57.120- 09:01.100* :  Where the forecasters have warned that the downpours will actually intensify this week,
*09:01.100- 09:06.240* :  our Beijing correspondent is Laura Bicker. This has been a week of torrential rain,
*09:06.240- 09:13.020* :  heavy downpours, landslides, mudslides, rivers overflowing their banks, and it's taken a heavy toll
*09:13.020- 09:18.520* :  throughout southern China. The worst affected province is Guangdong province. This is a province
*09:18.520- 09:27.160* :  of 127 million people. It's China's economic powerhouse. 47 people are said to have lost
*09:27.160- 09:33.260* :  their lives in the last week in Guangdong, in torrential rain and flooding. The other province
*09:33.260- 09:39.620* :  amply, which actually just over a week ago was suffering from drought parts of the province.
*09:40.020- 09:46.740* :  Now it is suffering from severe flooding in parts of mountain areas, and officials are
*09:46.740- 09:52.500* :  warning about floods in mountain streams and gorges, and there are tens of thousands of people
*09:52.500- 09:58.760* :  who are being evacuated from low-lying areas. And then into other provinces like the
*09:58.760- 10:05.880* :  lower Yangtze River areas, they are extremely concerned about those regions to over the next week,
*10:05.880- 10:13.040* :  as heavy rain continues to fall, to give you an idea of the extreme situation. The National
*10:13.040- 10:19.300* :  Meteorological Centre has issued a red alert. It's only the third time that the National Centre
*10:19.300- 10:24.720* :  has issued such a alert the first time this year, and previous times have been last year,
*10:24.720- 10:30.380* :  and in 2011, that gives you an idea of just how worried officials have become.
*10:30.380- 10:36.500* :  President Xi has ordered all out efforts for the flood and to ensure that people are taken
*10:36.500- 10:42.440* :  to safe ground when needed. Laura Bicker. Buckingham Palace says that Princess Anne,
*10:42.440- 10:47.660* :  the sister of King Charles, has sustained minor injuries and a concussion after an incident
*10:47.660- 10:53.280* :  yesterday. She's now in hospital for observation. The BBC's Royal Correspondent, Daniela Relf,
*10:53.280- 10:58.240* :  gave this update to the BBC's Lucy Hawkins. The Princess Royal Princess Anne, she is, of course,
*10:58.240- 11:03.220* :  the youngest sister of the King King Charles. She was on Gatcom Park estate. It's her home,
*11:03.600- 11:07.640* :  and a state in Gloucestershire and the West of England yesterday afternoon, when we are told
*11:07.640- 11:12.440* :  there was an incident, as it's been described, and she suffered minor injuries and concussion.
*11:12.960- 11:17.660* :  We're told that she was walking on the estate when this happened, but that there were horses
*11:17.980- 11:23.500* :  in the vicinity, and it seems that her head injuries were consistent with some kind of
*11:23.500- 11:28.660* :  impact from a horse's head or leg. So, although it says she was walking rather than riding,
*11:28.660- 11:34.120* :  there does seem to have been some involvement of horses in terms of the injuries that she suffered,
*11:34.620- 11:40.060* :  and the emergency services were called to the estate, and the Princess Royal was assessed and taken
*11:40.060- 11:45.520* :  to a local hospital where she is currently being treated. She wasn't taken by air ambulance,
*11:45.520- 11:51.200* :  she was taken by road, and she was accompanied by her husband, Commander Tim Lawrence, he is with
*11:51.260- 11:57.100* :  her. We are told that she is being kept in for observation because she has had a head injury
*11:57.100- 12:02.340* :  and concussion. I think it's likely that she will be in hospital for the next few days before
*12:02.340- 12:08.300* :  she goes home to continue her recovery, and Buckingham Palace do say that they anticipate that she
*12:08.300- 12:13.740* :  will make a swift and full recovery. That is wonderful news, Daniel, that she's going to be okay,
*12:13.740- 12:18.420* :  but I have to say, when I first heard, I'm sure it was your first thought too. Horses were going
*12:18.420- 12:22.580* :  to be involved because she is known for her love of horse trees, and she's had this incredible
*12:22.580- 12:28.680* :  equestrian career as well. An Olympian, of course, 1976 in Montreal. Horses have really been her
*12:28.680- 12:34.760* :  life professionally, and privately, they are a significant part of what she does. We saw her here
*12:34.760- 12:39.500* :  in London a couple of weeks ago at the Trooping the Colour Parade on horseback. She was in fact,
*12:39.500- 12:43.960* :  had quite a frisky horse that day, and was showing her great skill at trying to deal with that horse
*12:43.960- 12:49.220* :  on the big parade through central London. So, you know, when we heard that she had been injured on
*12:49.220- 12:53.720* :  Gatcom park estate, there was a thought that could this be related to a horse? Daniel Aralph.
*12:54.680- 13:00.920* :  Now, is Europe turning against mass tourism? The mayor of the Spanish city of Barcelona has pledged
*13:00.920- 13:07.240* :  to eliminate short-term tourist lets in the city within five years. Johnny Colboni said he doesn't
*13:07.240- 13:13.220* :  plan to renew any of the 10,000 tourist licenses granted to land laws when they expire in November
*13:13.220- 13:19.320* :  2028. The socialist mayor said the apartments which are currently advertised on platforms like Air
*13:19.320- 13:25.480* :  B&B would be available to locals instead. My colleague Amal Rajan asked the travel journalist
*13:25.480- 13:31.060* :  Simon Cauder about why the city authorities are doing this. It is very simply as anybody who
*13:31.080- 13:37.460* :  has perhaps sought to have lovely weekend away in the Catalan capital will know that very large
*13:37.460- 13:44.500* :  numbers of apartments within the city centre are now turned over to Air B&B to the extent that
*13:44.500- 13:53.060* :  I'm even hearing stories of effectively investors buying them off plan in order to industrialise Air
*13:53.060- 13:59.820* :  B&B. Now, of course, Air B&B began as this lovely idea of, oh, there's a lot of crowds in town for
*13:59.820- 14:06.860* :  a convention or whatever. People can rent out their spare room, but now it is an industry and it's
*14:06.860- 14:12.200* :  clear that there's an awful lot of demand out there and as with any community if you can
*14:12.200- 14:18.120* :  kind of operate some of the levers to reduce the impact of what some would say is over tourism
*14:18.120- 14:23.440* :  or others would say is the wrong kind of tourism to make people stay in hotels instead while
*14:23.440- 14:28.320* :  they're thinking is that the locals will benefit. Mr Colboni has said that the measure would be
*14:28.320- 14:33.640* :  equivalent to building 10,000 new homes at a time when many people in Barcelona can't afford a
*14:33.640- 14:38.460* :  home which is a story common to people who look right across Western Europe and indeed this country.
*14:38.460- 14:44.860* :  It does suggest that there's a direct conflict in the views of that mayor between Air B&B and
*14:44.860- 14:51.980* :  tourism of that kind and homes for citizens. Certainly, yes, and this is happening in lots of places
*14:51.980- 14:59.920* :  for instance in the capital of Mallorca, Palma. I've seen graffiti doorbed on walls saying tourism
*14:59.920- 15:06.080* :  equals terrorism and again talking to people there they say we are being priced out of the market.
*15:06.360- 15:10.680* :  We don't mind of course we don't mind people going and staying in lovely hotels because those
*15:10.680- 15:18.040* :  are created specifically for tourists. What you're doing is effectively by renting on Air B&B and
*15:18.040- 15:24.480* :  this also applies in places like Dubrovniac and Prague and so on. You are kind of trespassing on our
*15:24.480- 15:29.640* :  space so please get back in your hotels and you're very welcome here. We love the money you spend
*15:29.640- 15:33.840* :  the jobs you create. We just don't like you taking our homes. It's obviously got a policy
*15:33.840- 15:38.700* :  within our trade-offs though Simon because Barcelona, the wonderful wonderful city with amazing
*15:38.700- 15:43.580* :  history of this amazing architecture, amazing cuisine and it's kind of built for tourists so this
*15:43.580- 15:48.400* :  could potentially be quite harmful to the to the very industry in which the city is based.
*15:48.480- 15:54.080* :  Yes, it will have an economic impact but that's the same in places like Amsterdam which is probably
*15:54.580- 15:59.740* :  on the front foot more than anybody else in trying to rebalance the city in favor of local
*15:59.740- 16:06.820* :  residents. They're imposing taxes. They're trying to keep stagging hen parties from the UK
*16:06.820- 16:12.040* :  out as much as possible and they're also the Dutch authorities in general promoting
*16:12.040- 16:19.420* :  undervisited cities like Rotterdam and Etrecht and Maastricht and that way people can benefit
*16:19.580- 16:26.160* :  the story from 99 points something percent of all the world's great cities. Yes, please send us
*16:26.160- 16:34.620* :  water is now. Simon Kolder. Still to come, as schools in Los Angeles ban smartphones,
*16:34.620- 16:41.840* :  not everyone is on board. Until you actually ban guns or you have a reasonable ban on guns,
*16:41.880- 16:45.220* :  at least ban assault weapons. Why are we banning cell phones?
*16:54.520- 16:59.540* :  Want to teach your kids financial literacy but not sure where to start? Green light can help.
*17:00.080- 17:04.740* :  With green light, parents can keep an eye on kids spending and saving while kids and teens

*17:37.360- 17:43.620* :  about culture, the latest trends, inspiration and so much more. We'll hear from celebrities,
*17:43.620- 17:50.120* :  authors, experts and listeners like you. Bring a little optimism into your life with the Bright Side.

*18:00.420- 18:06.900* :  Now around 50 million people suffer from epilepsy across the globe but not all sufferers can
*18:06.900- 18:12.940* :  control their seizures with medication alone. Now British doctors have developed a new treatment which
*18:12.940- 18:18.980* :  involves fitting a small device inside the skull. The first person to undergo this operation is a
*18:18.980- 18:25.040* :  teenager from the west of England, Orren Nolson. And our medical editor, Fergus Walsh, has been to
*18:25.040- 18:35.220* :  meet him and his family. Thank you. Orren is 12 years old. He has autism and ADHD but what is
*18:35.220- 18:42.460* :  holding him back most is his epilepsy. He's not had a day without seizures since he was three.
*18:42.460- 18:49.360* :  Some are so severe he stops breathing. Epilepsy seizures are triggered by abnormal bursts of
*18:49.360- 18:57.840* :  electrical activity in the brain. These can often be controlled by drugs but Orren's form of
*18:57.840- 19:04.880* :  epilepsy, known as Lennox Gastocindrome, is so severe nothing has helped. I want him to find
*19:04.880- 19:15.160* :  some of himself again through the haze of seizures I'd like to get my boy back. It's October 2023.
*19:15.640- 19:20.800* :  Orren is being prepared for major surgery at Great Ormon Street Hospital in London.
*19:21.560- 19:28.220* :  He's the first child in the world to trial a neuro stimulator which will sit in his skull.
*19:28.460- 19:34.140* :  The number one right will start with 190. The device will send electrical impulses deep
*19:34.140- 19:41.040* :  into Orren's brain via two electrodes. This study is hopefully going to allow us to identify
*19:41.040- 19:46.560* :  really whether this is an efficacious treatment for epilepsy and also is looking at a new type of
*19:46.560- 19:52.340* :  device which is particularly useful in children because the implant is in the skull and not in the
*19:52.340- 19:58.200* :  chest and we hope that that will reduce the potential complications. Not easy. In the coming months
*19:58.220- 20:07.500* :  three more patients will undergo the same surgery. Final checks complete. Orren's surgery has gone
*20:07.500- 20:12.420* :  without a hitch. It's pretty spot on to me. It looks very good so we're super happy and that's
*20:12.420- 20:18.880* :  really great. A month later Orren and his parents are back at Great Ormon Street
*20:18.880- 20:26.900* :  for his device to be switched on. Slowly the current is increased to the target level.
*20:34.860- 20:43.080* :  Seven months on he's more active and independent. Now age 13 epilepsy no longer dominates his life.
*20:46.340- 20:52.540* :  Caesar wise we have seen a massive improvement and just overall we're seeing a much better quality
*20:52.540- 21:00.640* :  life I think and and he's happier. Orren's daytime seizures have reduced by 80 percent
*21:01.660- 21:08.320* :  but further improvements are possible as doctors plan to tailor his device to make it even more
*21:08.320- 21:15.260* :  responsive to his brain activity. Orren's family know his treatment is not a cure but they're
*21:15.260- 21:20.840* :  optimistic. He will continue to emerge from the shadow cast by his epilepsy.
*21:21.780- 21:28.260* :  Focus wash. To the Philippines now and a court has thrown out all drug charges against a former
*21:28.260- 21:34.280* :  government minister and vocal critic of the ex-president of Rodrigo de Terte. Lele de Lima
*21:34.280- 21:38.660* :  spent more than six years in prison despite never having been convicted of a crime.
*21:38.760- 21:43.300* :  Speaking to reporters shortly after leaving court she said she had been vindicated although
*21:43.300- 21:47.960* :  Mr. Leema was speaking in English we've re-voiced her words because of the background noise.
*21:52.560- 21:59.500* :  I am now completely free and vindicated it's very liberating. I respected the rule of law
*21:59.500- 22:06.520* :  despite the pain and the injustice of it all. I confronted the charges head on and I went through
*22:06.520- 22:13.340* :  and endured the whole process. Are Asia-Pacific regional editor Mickey Brister told me more about
*22:13.340- 22:19.500* :  why she was jailed? Lele de Lima was a senior politician in the Philippines. She was a former
*22:19.500- 22:26.500* :  justice secretary and a senator. She headed up the Philippine Human Rights Commission so a really
*22:26.500- 22:35.100* :  serious senior figure. These charges three charges initially she faced have to be arrested in 2017.
*22:36.140- 22:43.100* :  Essentially laid a range of drug charges at her door. She denied all those charges.
*22:43.100- 22:50.640* :  Two of them were dismissed a few years ago. She was released from prison on bail last November
*22:50.640- 22:55.560* :  and what's happened now is this third charge has been while the trial has collapsed essentially
*22:55.560- 23:01.420* :  because there isn't enough evidence. The case against her was that while she was justice minister
*23:02.020- 23:07.860* :  she allowed inmates at the Philippines biggest prison to trade drugs in return for bribes an
*23:08.240- 23:13.500* :  extraordinary allegation of which the judges said there's there's simply not enough evidence and so
*23:14.140- 23:20.000* :  she's free of all and vindicated as you hear there free of all those charges against her.
*23:20.460- 23:25.020* :  And she says that she was taken in the first place because of her criticism of the former
*23:25.020- 23:31.260* :  president de tetes war on drugs. She does say that and it's certainly the case that she was a
*23:31.260- 23:37.380* :  very vocal critic of president of certain. In fact before he became the president of the Philippines
*23:37.380- 23:41.800* :  whilst he was still the mayor of a city called the devout on the island of Mindanao. She
*23:41.800- 23:48.120* :  launched an investigation into his similar war on drugs air whilst he was mayor. He then brought
*23:48.120- 23:53.820* :  that policy to national government once he became president in 2016 in the Philippines and
*23:54.280- 24:00.540* :  it left thousands of people dead and some of them in very very murky circumstances. In fact the
*24:01.040- 24:06.120* :  international criminal court is investigating that campaign and that policy at the moment
*24:06.120- 24:12.620* :  Laila Delima went after Mr. de tetes question this policy and it was shortly after that that
*24:13.420- 24:18.600* :  she faced these drug charges and in fact whilst he was in office president de tetes said he
*24:18.600- 24:25.880* :  was going to go after the senator. So there's a lot of reason to suspect her suspicions that it
*24:25.880- 24:31.960* :  was because of her attack on on president de tetes was the cause of her drug charges.
*24:32.280- 24:35.680* :  And what's happened to that controversial war on drugs policy now?
*24:36.040- 24:41.540* :  We've been to discontinued. There's now a new president for Nanjat Marcus Jr. in the Philippines.
*24:41.540- 24:47.900* :  He doesn't pursue that policy but there's still lots of hangovers from that period.
*24:47.900- 24:53.500* :  The lots of people who believe that their loved ones died there haven't found hadn't got just
*24:53.500- 24:59.060* :  this very few people have been prosecuted because of this but still the international criminal court
*24:59.060- 25:01.780* :  is investigating so we haven't heard the last word on them.
*25:02.340- 25:08.280* :  Mickey Brister. Now how often do you find yourself scrolling through social media even during family
*25:08.280- 25:14.320* :  meals or conversations? It can be an addictive activity as we all know across the United States
*25:14.320- 25:19.760* :  officials are now working to restrict access to phones in schools saying that they're disruptive
*25:19.760- 25:25.080* :  and damaging to children's mental health. The largest school district in Los Angeles has just
*25:25.080- 25:28.060* :  voted to ban them. Regan Morris reports from there.
*25:31.740- 25:36.060* :  Fights at US schools are routinely filmed by children and posted to social media.
*25:38.460- 25:42.020* :  It's definitely altered the landscape for us as teachers but now we're really seeing
*25:42.020- 25:47.320* :  cell phones being weaponized. Ruth Luvenos has been a teacher in LA for 25 years.
*25:48.000- 25:53.300* :  She thinks smartphones should be banned at all schools. Students are using them to bully other
*25:53.300- 25:58.440* :  students. I had a student this year who was all the students had the cell phones out in the hallway
*25:58.440- 26:03.460* :  in between classes and they were trying to bully one of my female students to fight another student
*26:03.540- 26:08.080* :  while they were all live on IG on Instagram. That's what I mean by weaponized like literally
*26:08.300- 26:15.560* :  you know using the phones to promote violence. Viral videos of school fights are pervasive
*26:16.300- 26:21.660* :  but it's the quieter grind of social media addiction and its mental health impact on kids
*26:22.260- 26:26.440* :  feeling much of the debate to ban cell phones at school. What do you think to use your cell phone
*26:26.440- 26:33.100* :  at school much? Yes like a lot but not necessarily for like school work at all. What do you do with it?
*26:33.980- 26:40.000* :  Text my friends and Instagram and honestly it's just like a tool to like keep me from being bored.
*26:41.100- 26:46.400* :  Yeah not being bored. I use it for music a lot but I don't think that without it it would be
*26:46.400- 26:50.980* :  too bad because that was how it was at our middle school and it was completely fine.
*26:51.100- 26:55.600* :  Vivian Griffin are both 16 and while they're not opposed to banning smartphones at school
*26:55.600- 27:00.200* :  they just don't think it will work. Their school is bigger than many small towns with more than
*27:00.200- 27:05.300* :  3,000 students. If you're taking kids' phones at the beginning of the day there's going to be kids
*27:05.820- 27:10.340* :  sneaking them in every day like anything that involves actually taking it from them I think is
*27:10.340- 27:13.920* :  going to be really really hard. But I also am not sure how they're going to implement
*27:14.440- 27:19.040* :  leaving it at home because there's no way everyone's going to do that so I think L.A. school board
*27:19.040- 27:23.980* :  member Nick Melvoyne introduced the ban. How is it going to work? So schools will have an
*27:23.980- 27:27.400* :  opportunity over the next few months to choose their enforcing mechanism. What we've seen for
*27:27.400- 27:30.980* :  schools that are doing this and this is going to be a growing movement. An hour after we passed
*27:30.980- 27:35.160* :  our resolution the governor of California said you'd like the state to follow suit. Some schools
*27:35.160- 27:39.760* :  have cell phone lockers so you walk into school you check your phone in you get it at the end of
*27:39.760- 27:44.760* :  the day. Others have these pouches like at a concert or maybe a comedy show that get magnetically
*27:44.760- 27:49.040* :  sealed when you enter into a school and then you can unseal when you leave. I understand a middle
*27:49.040- 27:53.580* :  and high school phones are out there and middle and high schoolers need them for transportation or
*27:53.580- 27:58.280* :  sports or extracurriculars or internships so that's where the phone lockers or the pouches will
*27:58.280- 28:02.480* :  come in handy. The pouches are expensive though. They are but you know district-wide the budget
*28:02.480- 28:08.440* :  impact for this policy was about $10 million out of a budget of about $17 billion and so I think
*28:08.440- 28:12.280* :  the return on this investment will be huge. Now even if it's coming out of the general fund $10
*28:12.280- 28:17.120* :  million I think to improve kids' academic and mental health we'll get a huge return on that
*28:17.120- 28:22.440* :  investment. But for many parents even those who recognize that smartphones are disruptive and can
*28:22.440- 28:26.980* :  lead to mental health problems for children the thought of banning them at school is not an
*28:26.980- 28:33.900* :  option they want. Until you actually ban guns or you have a reasonable ban on guns at least ban
*28:33.900- 28:39.860* :  assault weapons why are we banning cell phones like. Miria Jo thinks banning for us outright is a
*28:39.860- 28:45.020* :  dangerous idea. On her daughter's first day of middle school there was a lockdown because a man
*28:45.020- 28:50.360* :  had a gun near the school. I was just to relieve that she had a cell phone and I could actually you
*28:50.360- 28:55.840* :  know texture and say everything was okay it's so scary for the families. I can't think of a
*28:55.840- 29:00.880* :  single parent I know who hasn't been through at least one lockdown where they're worrying about
*29:00.880- 29:07.920* :  their kids. I can't think of a single family and it's a huge problem. Teachers agree it is a
*29:07.920- 29:13.560* :  huge problem but they mostly say smartphones are not the solution and that they're often used
*29:13.560- 29:19.840* :  to spread misinformation. Reagan Morris reporting. Now have you ever felt like you're living
*29:19.840- 29:26.180* :  with an emotional overdraft. According to experts that means overstretching yourself regularly to
*29:26.180- 29:33.480* :  the point of nearing burnout and a new study from a US data firm says that a quarter of business leaders
*29:33.480- 29:39.700* :  report they feel burned out in their words often or always. Stephanie Prentice has the details.
*29:40.400- 29:45.380* :  The struggle to achieve work-life balance is something most people can relate to
*29:45.940- 29:52.300* :  and getting it wrong is certainly well documented in popular culture like this famous scene from
*29:52.300- 30:00.820* :  the movie Jerry McGuire. Let me just say as I ease out of the office I helped build that there
*30:00.820- 30:07.220* :  is such a thing as manners these fish hat manners in fact they're coming with me.
*30:07.660- 30:13.780* :  Now experts are warning that a significant amount of business leaders are subsidising the success
*30:13.780- 30:19.520* :  of their company with their emotional and physical health calling it the hidden cost line
*30:19.520- 30:26.420* :  in a business's profit and loss. A report by Gallup the American analytics firm found a quarter
*30:26.420- 30:32.700* :  of leaders in the workplace feel burned out often or always and that burnout can lead to fatigue,
*30:32.700- 30:40.340* :  insomnia, anxiety and depression but to people take it seriously enough. Leadership coach Andy
*30:40.340- 30:47.340* :  Brown says a lot of leaders don't. There's a pervasive myth that leadership should be difficult
*30:47.340- 30:51.180* :  or the running business should be stressful it's just that you know this the research I've done
*30:51.180- 30:56.540* :  shows the constant feedback saying that this is just the way it is I'm you know I'm the boss I'm
*30:56.540- 31:02.120* :  expected to feel this way and often that's invisible but I had an email the other day from a founder
*31:02.780- 31:05.780* :  who told me that she goes to work and then she cries in the toilets every day.
*31:06.120- 31:11.980* :  Some companies have been accused of not taking burnout seriously enough either with Samsung's
*31:11.980- 31:18.240* :  new policy for executives to work a six day week creating waves in the industry. Others however
*31:18.240- 31:23.760* :  have been exploring the opposite approach with some British companies following in the footsteps
*31:23.760- 31:31.480* :  of Iceland New Zealand and Japan in trialing a four day work week which saw a 57% decline in the
*31:31.480- 31:38.460* :  likelihood an employee would quit but for anyone feeling like they do need to quit Andy Brown has
*31:38.460- 31:44.820* :  some advice. Understand what emotional overdraft is understand where it's occurring for you
*31:45.260- 31:49.480* :  and that's going to give you the opportunity to at least take a pause and then maybe do something
*31:49.480- 31:54.900* :  about it. If you have burnout then most organisations now reflect that but it's before you get to
*31:54.900- 31:58.920* :  the stage of burnout where the critical issues are. That report was by Stephanie Prentice.
*32:01.140- 32:05.180* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
