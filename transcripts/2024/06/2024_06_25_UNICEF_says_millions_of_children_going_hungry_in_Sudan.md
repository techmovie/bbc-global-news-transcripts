*01:04.100- 01:07.720* :  This is the Global News podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:10.220- 01:16.420* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 25th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:17.020- 01:21.720* :  The head of UNICEF says 9 million children in Sudan don't get enough to eat,
*01:22.140- 01:25.180* :  and almost none are in school as the conflict there continues.
*01:25.720- 01:29.240* :  Less than a week before parliamentary elections, President Macron of France
*01:29.240- 01:34.960* :  has warned that the policies of the far right and the hard left could lead to civil war.
*01:35.480- 01:39.560* :  Three major American record companies are suing two AI firms,
*01:40.080- 01:43.560* :  accusing them of infringing artists' copyright to create music.
*01:46.280- 01:47.500* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:47.540- 01:54.900* :  the nuns were trying to buy a monastery in a nearby town, which the church apparently vetoed.
*01:55.080- 01:59.020* :  Now they've locked themselves into their Spanish conference saying they're being
*01:59.300- 02:04.380* :  persecuted by the Catholic Church and no longer recognized the authority of the Pope.
*02:08.140- 02:12.880* :  We begin in Sudan, where there's been a stark warning from the United Nations saying the
*02:12.880- 02:16.800* :  country now has the largest displacement of children anywhere.
*02:17.300- 02:22.520* :  Malnutrition, starvation, and millions out of school makes it one of the worst places in the world
*02:22.520- 02:27.720* :  for children, the agency says. The country has been torn apart by more than a year of brutal
*02:27.720- 02:34.260* :  civil war with catastrophic humanitarian consequences. Here's the UNICEF Chief Catherine Russell.
*02:34.580- 02:39.300* :  A famine doesn't happen overnight. Once it hits, it's very hard to turn it around.
*02:39.560- 02:45.020* :  We need to act now. It's just going to get worse. You can always eventually make progress on
*02:45.020- 02:50.820* :  something, right? So nothing is completely impossible. But for individual babies, for children who are
*02:51.220- 02:57.120* :  starving now, who are hungry, who are severely malnourished, yeah, it will be too late for that.
*02:57.320- 03:02.900* :  Catherine Russell was speaking to the BBC's Barbara Plett Asher, who told me more about how the
*03:02.900- 03:08.660* :  situation has become so dire. What I liked the war has just really been very punishing the pillars
*03:08.660- 03:13.300* :  of the food economy have collapsed. That was a big thing and farming in particular because of
*03:13.300- 03:19.040* :  looting and insecurity and lack of transport and markets and so on. You had grain shipments from
*03:19.040- 03:25.140* :  Ukraine that have stopped. You would have humanitarian aid, but both warring parties have been
*03:25.140- 03:32.300* :  restricting the flow of aid and that's been quite crucial to the increase in hunger and the
*03:32.300- 03:37.140* :  hunger crisis. To the degree that some are asking whether this is actually part of battlefield
*03:37.140- 03:42.140* :  tactics and that is a question that I did put to Catherine Russell. Do you think the two sides
*03:42.140- 03:48.560* :  are using starvation as a weapon of war? You know, it's hard for me to say that. I don't know what
*03:48.560- 03:54.220* :  their intentions are. I can only talk about the result. It is 100% a man-made famine, a man-made
*03:54.720- 03:59.660* :  problem here, for sure. I mean, there's no question about that. That we, the challenge for us is
*03:59.700- 04:03.540* :  not that we don't have the food or that we don't have the access to, is that we can't get it to
*04:03.540- 04:08.460* :  the people who need it. Catherine Russell, that's clearly heartfelt. We can hear her describing
*04:08.460- 04:14.700* :  the difficulties that UNICEF is facing. What is needed to turn things around to stop
*04:15.360- 04:21.320* :  sedan and its people from facing further disaster? Almost immediately it's access and volume and
*04:21.320- 04:24.880* :  this is what aid organizations have been shouting from the rooftops, so to speak. They,
*04:24.880- 04:30.560* :  they say, get in large amounts of life-saving aid quickly and consistently, but as I mentioned,
*04:30.560- 04:35.280* :  there have been restrictions. You have the Army blocking delivery of aid across conflict lines
*04:35.280- 04:40.700* :  into RSF held territory. You have the RSF being blamed for a lot of the plunder and it's now
*04:40.700- 04:45.620* :  been besieging a city of nearly two million outfasher for more than a month. So that's the most
*04:45.620- 04:50.920* :  immediate method, but long-term, you know, the only solution isn't into the fighting, so essentially
*04:51.540- 04:54.520* :  and crucially, the economy can be restored and then everything else can follow.
*04:55.300- 04:59.140* :  Is there really, though, any hope of that actually happening, all the recent
*04:59.140- 05:04.080* :  efforts to restart peace talks have failed and the recent appeal from the UN was ignored?
*05:04.880- 05:10.860* :  Yeah, there isn't any real hope of that actually happening soon. The UN did demand that the
*05:10.860- 05:15.500* :  fighting around al-Fasha'aand and it hasn't. This new American envoy has been trying to restart
*05:15.500- 05:20.000* :  peace negotiations. That hasn't worked. The Sudan's army chief, the de facto head of government,
*05:20.000- 05:24.020* :  basically said there aren't going to be negotiations or a ceasefire until the rebellion,
*05:24.020- 05:30.580* :  as he called it, referring to the RSF fighters, was defeated. You know, what the UN Secretary
*05:30.580- 05:35.140* :  General has said is that peace efforts failed because both parties have made a bet that they
*05:35.140- 05:40.620* :  could win militarily, but it should also be said that they failed because the two parties are
*05:40.620- 05:44.860* :  strengthened in those positions by regional powers who have backed one or the other.
*05:45.280- 05:51.520* :  So it is a very complex situation and there isn't really any clear sign that it is going to
*05:51.520- 05:55.240* :  get better anytime soon. Barbara, it is a story which I keep hearing
*05:55.240- 05:59.160* :  colleagues saying it should hit the top of the news agenda more, but so often it isn't,
*05:59.160- 06:04.280* :  so often it slips down. Yeah, I did ask Catherine Russell about that. She said that there's a lot
*06:04.280- 06:09.580* :  competing for attention. She mentioned other crises in the world. Others have said it's not
*06:09.580- 06:14.560* :  just Sudan's forgotten war. It's just deprioritized them and the international powers, although they
*06:14.560- 06:20.460* :  do make an effort, they don't persistently engage in a way that lifts it above a regional crisis,
*06:20.460- 06:24.160* :  which is how it seems they're treating it when it could become much more than that,
*06:24.160- 06:30.080* :  given the strategic place that Sudan occupies in East Africa. Barbara, Platt, Usher.
*06:30.920- 06:36.400* :  Next to France, President Emmanuel Macron has warned that the election policies of his far
*06:36.400- 06:42.400* :  right and hard left opponents could lead to civil war. Speaking ahead of the first round of
*06:42.400- 06:47.580* :  voting in France's parliamentary election this weekend, he said that both sides divide people
*06:47.580- 06:58.380* :  on the basis of identity. If we follow this logic to the end, the country will erupt,
*06:58.980- 07:04.240* :  or it will turn to civil war, and that's why I deeply disagree with both extremes,
*07:05.100- 07:10.440* :  and I disagree with those who follow them. Mr. Macron called the vote two weeks ago after
*07:10.440- 07:16.380* :  the far right anti-immigrant national rally party came first in the European elections.
*07:16.380- 07:21.880* :  They currently are head in the opinion polls with a new alliance of left-wing parties second,
*07:21.880- 07:29.260* :  and Mr. Macron's centrist group in third. Nicolas Conquer is the national rally candidate for Normandy.
*07:29.260- 07:34.980* :  What did he make of President Macron's comments? The president should not say such a thing.
*07:34.980- 07:41.040* :  In addition, it's not a possible threat he mentioned. He owes the French people to bear his own
*07:41.040- 07:45.680* :  part of responsibility and what led to this. He's been in command the commander in chief
*07:46.120- 07:50.500* :  for the last seven years, so he's definitely to blame we've landed today.
*07:51.360- 07:57.420* :  Rebecca Kesby spoke to Catherine Norris Trent, senior correspondent for the French television
*07:57.420- 08:03.900* :  network France 24. She began by asking her how is President Macron's recent remark being read
*08:04.360- 08:09.400* :  in France? It's perfect. Some astonishment at the strength of the words he's used,
*08:09.400- 08:14.940* :  so he's hitting the headlines. Presumably that's what he hoped to do in going on this podcast,
*08:14.940- 08:21.960* :  trying to win back electors who maybe have drifted away from him since his first election in 2017,
*08:22.140- 08:29.660* :  and then in 2022. He was on this podcast, which is hosted by an entrepreneur, and it's a very
*08:29.660- 08:36.060* :  chatty tone. So he had a very wide-ranging discussion for one hour and 45 minutes, during which he
*08:36.060- 08:42.840* :  made these comments about the risk of the country exploding and the country turning to civil war
*08:42.840- 08:49.540* :  as part of that. So it will be seen perhaps as divisive, perhaps as him trying to scare off people
*08:49.540- 08:55.100* :  from voting alternatives to him, and whether it appeals to his base, well, you know, remains to be seen.
*08:55.240- 08:59.860* :  I mean, we know that Mr. Macron already has a fight on his hands on the right, doesn't he? He
*09:00.120- 09:04.920* :  pretty much said the same after those elections, the European elections. This does seem
*09:04.920- 09:11.420* :  though he's opening up a new political fight on the left, though, as well. And is it going to urge
*09:11.420- 09:16.080* :  people to the centre or actually undermine his own party in the centre? Well, it depends how much
*09:16.340- 09:22.640* :  credibility Macron himself retains. He's a very divisive and unpopular figure in France. He's not
*09:22.640- 09:29.800* :  well-loved by the French population, including by previous supporters. He's much criticized. So on
*09:29.800- 09:35.460* :  the left and on the right, you've got very strong voices and hard-line views coming forward to
*09:35.460- 09:40.380* :  oppose him. So Macron is trying to position himself as in the centre of that, the voice of reason,
*09:40.780- 09:46.340* :  reasonable politics to cut through some of the hard left and hard right say that if you want
*09:46.820- 09:52.060* :  safe politics, a safe pair of hands, then you've got to vote for my party. And briefly, is there
*09:52.060- 09:57.880* :  any kind of concern that security itself could be in danger after this election? Well, there
*09:57.880- 10:01.960* :  are a lot of fears in France right now about it. People are bracing themselves for demonstrations.
*10:02.120- 10:06.480* :  If the far right gets into power, perhaps after the first round of voting and after the second
*10:06.480- 10:11.060* :  round of voting too, we've had large street demonstrations for the past few weekends and on
*10:11.060- 10:17.940* :  some evenings too. In France, protesting is a big thing about politics. And that often degenerates
*10:17.940- 10:22.800* :  into clashes with riot police. So there are real fears that this is a turning point and could
*10:22.800- 10:26.760* :  potentially degenerate into disorder, albeit if not civil war.
*11:00.000- 11:04.720* :  In the Russian Republic of Dagestan, this was a coordinated attack on two citizens.
*11:07.060- 11:12.760* :  In Derpent and Mahachkala, gunmen targeted churches, synagogues and a police checkpoint.
*11:13.480- 11:18.280* :  Among the dead was a Russian Orthodox priest. Gun battles with security forces
*11:18.640- 11:24.340* :  raged long into the night. By morning, the anti-terrorist operation was declared over.
*11:24.780- 11:28.400* :  The local authorities declared three days of mourning for the victims.
*11:31.300- 11:37.020* :  The head of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, said the insurgents had aimed to destroy into ethnic unity.
*11:37.840- 11:44.400* :  He stated he knew who was behind the attack, but didn't say who. The suspicion is that there
*11:44.400- 11:49.780* :  is a link to radical Islam. In recent years, the Islamic State Group has claimed responsibility
*11:49.880- 11:55.920* :  for a string of attacks in Dagestan. And yet the Russian authorities appear reluctant to talk
*11:55.920- 12:02.260* :  openly about the Islamist threat. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the official
*12:02.260- 12:07.820* :  narrative here is that the greatest threat to Russia's security is from Ukraine and the West,
*12:08.420- 12:14.120* :  which explains why a Russian MP went on state TV to suggest that it was Kiev and NATO.
*12:14.620- 12:20.440* :  That orchestrated the Dagestan attacks. Not everyone here is convinced. One Russian senator
*12:20.440- 12:26.900* :  wrote on social media that if his country blamed every terrorist attack on scheming by Ukraine and
*12:26.900- 12:33.940* :  NATO, the pink mist, as he put it, would bring Russia bigger problems. Steve Rosenberg.
*12:34.560- 12:40.180* :  Authorities in the European Union are accusing the tech giant Apple of breaking new laws designed
*12:40.180- 12:46.000* :  to rein in such companies. The European Commission said Apple's App Store unfairly squeezes out
*12:46.000- 12:52.140* :  rival marketplaces. The firm could face a potential fine of up to 10 percent of its global revenue.
*12:52.620- 12:56.320* :  But Apple says it's confident it's complying with the law. The Commission, though,
*12:56.980- 13:00.280* :  has serious doubts, according to spokesperson Thomas Rainier.
*13:00.720- 13:07.640* :  Under the Digital Markets Act, the gatekeepers, basically developers, should be able to steer
*13:07.640- 13:14.820* :  consumers to alternative offers, cheaper options outside of the App Store. And following our
*13:14.820- 13:22.100* :  investigation, we now have doubts and we believe that Apple is in breach of the DMA when it comes
*13:22.100- 13:27.840* :  to these steering rules. The technology journalist Chris Stockle Walker explains what happens next
*13:27.840- 13:33.640* :  in the route between Apple and the EU. They basically have until March next year to further
*13:34.200- 13:38.440* :  investigate. The allegation, obviously, is that Apple is in breach of the Digital Markets Act, which
*13:38.440- 13:45.100* :  is a bit of legislation passed in November 2022, came into force in May 2023. And one of the
*13:45.100- 13:51.460* :  really interesting things is it's one of a suite of laws that the EU has put in place and is
*13:51.940- 13:57.880* :  using to try and tame big tech. It's not shy about doing so. And so this is not the first time
*13:57.880- 14:03.200* :  that the European Union has started to act against these companies. But obviously with Apple,
*14:03.200- 14:09.340* :  being so big, 400 billion also in revenue and 10% of that could be at stake here with a fine,
*14:09.820- 14:15.140* :  40 odd billion could be at stake here if they were found to be in breach of this. And also it's
*14:15.140- 14:20.440* :  worth noting that the European Commission opened a separate issue today alongside this investigating
*14:20.500- 14:26.680* :  additional fees for apps that are very, very popular of individual downloads that are charged to
*14:26.680- 14:32.680* :  the providers. But I think there's more at stake here than just this one fight. This is a case of
*14:32.680- 14:38.100* :  big tech kind of being brought to heel for the first time in maybe 20 years. And they're not really
*14:38.100- 14:43.220* :  very keen on it. So I think that actually, yes, we will see a large number of fights going on here
*14:43.220- 14:48.860* :  as the European Commission tries to bring these people back into force. And actually, they don't want
*14:48.860- 14:56.020* :  to have that happen at all. Chris Stockle Walker. The poor clairs of Bellerardo, a group of Catholic
*14:56.020- 15:03.040* :  nuns in Spain are famous for the chocolates they make. They sell them online and in two shops
*15:03.040- 15:07.860* :  in the town's near to their convent. But they've now locked themselves into their convent,
*15:08.620- 15:13.420* :  saying they're being persecuted by the Catholic Church and no longer recognise the authority of
*15:13.420- 15:19.520* :  the Pope. The Archbishop says they have been excommunicated and must leave the convent. I asked
*15:19.520- 15:24.920* :  our Europe Regional Editor Nikki Cardwell, how does a group of nuns fall out with the Pope?
*15:25.400- 15:30.140* :  Sounds rather strange, doesn't it? Apparently, this originates from a property deal. The nuns were
*15:30.140- 15:37.660* :  trying to buy a monastery in a nearby town, which the church apparently vetoed. They wanted to know
*15:37.660- 15:43.600* :  where the money was coming from. There was a benefactor and who that benefactor was. And it appears
*15:43.600- 15:49.240* :  to have led to a big dispute. The church got the deal cancelled, which resulted in the nuns
*15:49.560- 15:54.460* :  losing rather a lot of money. And it's escalated from there to the point where they were no longer
*15:55.080- 16:00.380* :  responding and have made this statement on Instagram saying they no longer recognise the Pope
*16:00.860- 16:05.420* :  and they are doing their own thing. They want to follow an ultra-conservative
*16:05.980- 16:11.660* :  former priest, again a man who's been excommunicated and they say they don't recognise any Pope
*16:11.660- 16:17.180* :  since the 1950s. Wow, this doesn't sound like your stereotypical group of nuns.
*16:17.360- 16:21.380* :  No, it doesn't. It's quite a lot of contradictions. They are talking about this old-fashioned view
*16:21.380- 16:26.800* :  that want to go back to a much more conservative view of the church, yet at the same time they are
*16:26.800- 16:32.560* :  very modern. They're on Instagram. They're on social media. There was a new intake of nuns
*16:32.560- 16:37.980* :  bought in in 1999 to bring the average age down. They were the ones that came up with the idea
*16:37.980- 16:43.060* :  of making chocolates and selling them so that they could bring in money to help themselves
*16:43.060- 16:48.880* :  subsist and to improve the convent in which they live it. So it's actually they are very modern
*16:48.880- 16:55.160* :  from that perspective and then you have the other side of the coin which seems to be that they're
*16:55.160- 17:01.840* :  leaning towards this ultra-conservative side which the church doesn't recognise. Now whether or not
*17:01.840- 17:09.180* :  they've been influenced by this man who is this religious leader, who knows, but either way this
*17:09.180- 17:14.700* :  is a real problem for the church. Can this be resolved or are the nuns literally going to be thrown
*17:14.700- 17:18.160* :  out onto the street? Well, that's what it's looking like at the moment. The local archbishop has
*17:18.160- 17:23.900* :  done a press conference this afternoon and he's been very very strong saying you've got to get out
*17:24.460- 17:29.740* :  or we're going to we're going to do it legally. Now it would seem to me that that kind of confrontation
*17:29.740- 17:35.260* :  is exactly what the church doesn't want. It doesn't look good for them. These are older women
*17:36.120- 17:41.440* :  and having to be physically removed. They're also very social media savvy so it is possible that
*17:41.440- 17:47.320* :  this would all play out live on social media. I doubt the church want that. They must find a
*17:47.320- 17:53.000* :  compromise. In a couple of seconds is non-chocolate delicious. I wish I knew. How are your regional
*17:53.000- 18:02.720* :  editor Nikki Cardwell? Still to come, why this sound? The common green growth of the sounds I can

*18:54.240- 18:58.880* :  if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*18:59.340- 19:01.880* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*19:01.880- 19:07.300* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t.

*19:26.880- 19:33.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast. The Lebanese authorities have organized a tour of Beirut
*19:33.020- 19:38.140* :  International Airport for journalists and diplomats in an effort to disprove claims that
*19:38.140- 19:42.840* :  Hezbollah is storing weapons there. It's also threatened to see the British newspaper,
*19:42.840- 19:48.660* :  which made the allegation, Korean Torbih reports. The tour was intended to show to the world
*19:48.660- 19:53.360* :  that Beirut Airport is safe. The Lebanese authorities say that claims
*19:53.360- 19:59.300* :  are part of a psychological warfare against Lebanon, while some in the country have expressed fears
*19:59.780- 20:04.580* :  that this could be used by Israel as a justification for a possible targeting of the airport.
*20:05.580- 20:11.980* :  Israel has struck Beirut Airport before. The last time was during Israel Hasbollah War in 2006,
*20:12.580- 20:16.980* :  when Israeli strikes on the airport halted flights in and out of the country.
*20:17.860- 20:23.620* :  Korean Torbih in Lebanon, and the route comes amid fears that growing clashes between Israel
*20:24.120- 20:31.140* :  and Lebanon's Hezbollah could lead to all-out war. At least 21,000 children are estimated to be
*20:31.140- 20:36.860* :  missing in Gaza, according to Save the Children. The charity quotes a UNICEF report from February
*20:37.240- 20:42.160* :  on children being separated as families were displaced. More are thought to have been affected
*20:42.160- 20:48.820* :  since Israel's assault on Raffa, Mike Thompson reports. Save the children's shares around 17,000
*20:48.820- 20:53.940* :  children are thought to have become separated from their families during mass displacements caused
*20:53.940- 20:59.480* :  by the fighting. Many lost touch with their parents when around a million civilians fled the
*20:59.480- 21:05.360* :  Israeli military's ongoing offensive in Raffa City. The aid agency estimates that a further
*21:05.360- 21:11.800* :  4,000 children are thought to be either missing under rubble, detained or buried in unmarked graves.
*21:11.800- 21:16.080* :  Its child protection teams have called for urgent action to protect,
*21:16.080- 21:23.520* :  separated and unaccompanied children in Gaza. Mike Thompson. In Colombia, the historic peace
*21:23.520- 21:29.580* :  agreement signed between the government and the rebel group the FARC in 2016 led to hopes for an
*21:29.580- 21:34.760* :  end to a conflict which killed hundreds of thousands of people. But since then, hundreds of
*21:34.760- 21:40.280* :  disaffected FARC rebels have resumed fighting, accusing the government of betraying the terms of
*21:40.280- 21:45.560* :  the deal. On Monday, peace talks between the Colombian government and the rebel group led by
*21:45.560- 21:53.420* :  Ivan Marquez began in Venezuela. I asked America's regional editor Leonardo Russia how important
*21:53.420- 21:59.640* :  is this meeting? It's very important because it's an opportunity for Colombia to go back on the
*21:59.640- 22:05.520* :  track of peace negotiations of peace. The agreement with the FARC which was by far the
*22:05.520- 22:11.500* :  biggest rebel group in Colombia had been fighting since the 1960s. There was very important,
*22:11.500- 22:17.800* :  was reported all across the world. And one of those who negotiated, probably the chief negotiator
*22:17.800- 22:24.880* :  for the FARC was Ivan Marquez. Well, he's now the leader of a rebel group that defected. He went
*22:24.880- 22:34.360* :  back into the jungle in 2019 to start this new fight. They agreed to come to the table again
*22:34.360- 22:41.060* :  with a different group. Most of the FARC members have given up on the fights and given up the weapons.
*22:41.060- 22:47.860* :  But you still have hundreds of fighters, about 1,600 to be precise, with this group, the group,
*22:47.860- 22:53.500* :  the Segunda Marquetalia. And you have other criminal groups, or the rebel groups and criminal groups
*22:53.540- 22:59.220* :  in Colombia. And the rebel groups are increasingly involved in crime, involved in drug trafficking
*22:59.220- 23:04.320* :  and other activities. Yeah, tell me more about Ivan Marquez. Why did his group and others abandon
*23:04.320- 23:09.640* :  the peace process? Well, happened in 2016, there was this deal. But a few years later,
*23:09.640- 23:15.060* :  there was a new government coming into power, right-wing president Ivan Doki-Hoo was very
*23:15.060- 23:20.560* :  critical of the agreement. And some of the FARC members were being arrested and being facing
*23:20.560- 23:26.800* :  the prospect of being deported to the United States. And they thought that the government had
*23:26.800- 23:32.360* :  betrayed the terms of the deal. Some not only were Marquez, but others have defected and said,
*23:32.360- 23:37.020* :  either we go, we leave, now we're going to be arrested according to them unfairly. And that's
*23:37.020- 23:42.300* :  why they resume the fighting. President has been trying to engage with rebel groups pretty much
*23:42.300- 23:47.100* :  since he came to power two years ago. How's that going? It was not going very well. President
*23:47.100- 23:52.580* :  Gustavo Petro, he's a former rebel, himself a former Marxist rebel. And he launched when he took
*23:52.580- 24:00.700* :  power in 2022, the total peace initiative. But so far, he has managed to engage with three groups.
*24:00.700- 24:05.360* :  He invited everyone to get involved in peace talks. He managed to get the biggest rebel group,
*24:05.360- 24:11.420* :  the LN in talks, another faction from the FARC to getting involved in peace talks. And now
*24:11.420- 24:16.860* :  the second market, I think it's very important for him to get these going and to have a
*24:16.860- 24:20.640* :  prospect of peace within his government. Leonardo Russia.
*24:21.860- 24:28.920* :  Three major US music labels have sued two artificial intelligence firms, alleging mass copyright
*24:28.920- 24:34.400* :  infringement. They're the latest legal battles between the music industry and tech companies
*24:34.400- 24:44.440* :  offering AI tools. Jason Lee reports. The viral song BBL Drizzy made using AI generative software
*24:44.440- 24:50.140* :  by the American producer Metro Boonim is just one of many examples mentioned in one of the lawsuits.
*24:50.340- 24:55.480* :  It's a diss track targeting the Canadian rapper Drake. In two separate cases,
*24:55.920- 25:01.420* :  Universal Sony and Warner jointly with the Recording Industry Association of America has filed
*25:01.420- 25:08.240* :  lawsuits against Udo, the AI software maker, and Suno, an AI music platform. The Association's CEO
*25:08.240- 25:13.400* :  Mitch Glazier said the firms were copying artists work and exploiting them for their own profit.
*25:14.360- 25:21.200* :  Jason Lee. For half the world, it's summer. And, indeed, this week in the UK, with the days
*25:21.200- 25:27.380* :  at their longest, this week should, herald the beginning of one of the loudest moments of the year,
*25:27.380- 25:33.380* :  there'll be an explosion of natural sounds, led by the chirip of crickets and grasshoppers.
*25:33.380- 25:40.460* :  However, that sound is changing dramatically and rapidly. Our correspondent David Silito has
*25:40.460- 25:45.500* :  been endorse it in southwest England, to meet a composer, who's beginning a tour of works
*25:45.500- 25:53.940* :  inspired by the changing sound of summer. Where are we going? We're going down to fiddle-fid mill,
*25:54.860- 26:00.120* :  which is on the river Sauer. What? I'm Karen Wimhurst. I'm a composer in clarinetis.
*26:00.460- 26:07.780* :  And in the case you've got? I have a speaker and my B-flat clarinet. When you're offered a chance
*26:07.800- 26:14.320* :  to wander down to a river bank, endorse it in the southwest of England, and listen to a duet
*26:14.320- 26:20.820* :  between a clarinet and a cricket, you say yes. It looks like a meadow. Yeah, beautiful meadow.
*26:21.060- 26:24.160* :  And it's not just any cricket. It's a bomb-bush cricket.
*26:28.180- 26:33.920* :  Isn't this spot in lockdown where I came down and every blade of grass was covered with grasshoppers?
*26:34.620- 26:37.540* :  I've never seen anything like it here, or again, actually.
*26:39.280- 26:44.140* :  Lockdown was, you know, on the one hand a very bleak time, but on the other hand, it gave nature space.
*26:49.840- 26:55.860* :  In these crickets have been singing for 300 million years, and they've got this kind of rhythm
*26:55.860- 27:00.180* :  and repetition and structure, which we all associate with music.
*27:02.080- 27:08.360* :  And the point to one of this, ever since that one cacophony in lockdown, the field has been silent.
*27:09.300- 27:15.720* :  The latest report, which has come out, said there's been a 75% decline across the UK in the
*27:15.720- 27:22.700* :  last 20 years of insect life. And it's with that thought in mind. We've come here,
*27:23.800- 27:29.960* :  British Moorland, with Peter Sutton. What do you do? I've been a national recorder for
*27:31.020- 27:35.740* :  orthoptor and allied species for over 20 years now. You're Mr Grasshopper, aren't you?
*27:36.580- 27:42.040* :  You could say that. The place he's brought me armed with his Grasshopper net, this little corner
*27:42.040- 27:47.300* :  of rural bedpature, just to the north of London. Well, it's a bit boggy. There's
*27:47.300- 27:51.420* :  rusty, corrugated metal lying around, and there's a distinct width.
*27:51.640- 27:58.180* :  Yes, normally this would be a lawyer with insects, but some things are very late this year.
*27:58.520- 28:02.580* :  Thankfully, Peter brought along some of his favourite Grasshoppers song, because
*28:03.100- 28:07.840* :  there was a point to our little ramble. Things are changing fast in the Grasshopper world.
*28:08.160- 28:10.780* :  This is the song of the Perseus bush cricket.
*28:14.800- 28:18.800* :  That's a completely new sound to me. This is new to this area then.
*28:18.960- 28:23.800* :  Well, as of over a decade ago, which in insect terms is right.
*28:23.800- 28:27.180* :  It's only 300 million years, and then suddenly they've...
*28:27.400- 28:31.160* :  Yes. The rate of colonisation of these species, no one would have predicted.
*28:31.540- 28:35.740* :  And Dunjlesn Kent, the tree cricket, is starting to sound Mediterranean.
*28:36.660- 28:40.280* :  So, if you're down in Dunjlesn, this is what you would hear in the summer.
*28:41.260- 28:44.560* :  Really? Absolutely, yeah. Amazing sound.
*28:45.320- 28:52.560* :  However, the overall story is one of disappearance, even the common Grasshopper.
*28:52.680- 28:55.280* :  The common green growth of the sounds like a sowing machine.
*28:56.700- 28:59.860* :  This is the species that is disappearing with climate change.
*29:01.360- 29:04.120* :  This is what summer used to sound like.
*29:04.260- 29:05.460* :  Yep. Yep.
*29:06.780- 29:10.440* :  This is the amount seen you're hearing each year going up or down.
*29:10.820- 29:13.620* :  Generally speaking, it's most definitely going down.
*29:14.220- 29:16.760* :  The changing sound of summer is getting quieter.
*29:16.760- 29:18.800* :  It is, it is getting quieter, yeah.
*29:21.520- 29:28.120* :  I've thought which takes us back to Karin's field and what we noticed when the music stopped.
*29:29.580- 29:32.740* :  It's June. I can hear the reeds.
*29:35.580- 29:37.060* :  Traffic. Yep.
*29:41.140- 29:42.420* :  It's not a buzz of anything, is there?
*29:45.100- 29:46.340* :  No, it's gutting, isn't it?
*29:48.040- 29:51.960* :  That report by David Silito in southwest England.
*29:55.100- 30:01.340* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
