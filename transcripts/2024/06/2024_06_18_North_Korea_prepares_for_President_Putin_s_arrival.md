*01:04.000- 01:07.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.760- 01:15.460* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, June the 18th, these are our main stories.
*01:16.080- 01:21.120* :  North Korea is preparing to welcome Vladimir Putin on his first visit there in more than 20 years,
*01:21.120- 01:25.160* :  and police in Kenya have fired tear gas and used water cannon
*01:25.460- 01:28.500* :  to try to disperse protesters opposed to a new finance bill.
*01:31.080- 01:36.000* :  Also in this podcast, the Senate in Thailand has passed a law allowing same-sex marriage,
*01:36.000- 01:38.280* :  the first in Southeast Asia to do so.
*01:38.560- 01:43.640* :  There will be able to legally nary, there will be able to manage joy of their property,
*01:43.640- 01:48.940* :  there will have the right to receive benefit, and for there will have consent for medical treatment.
*01:49.440- 01:54.520* :  And a parkour runner has caused anger in Italy after damaging an ancient building
*01:54.520- 01:56.000* :  in the city of Matara.
*02:00.560- 02:03.940* :  We begin in North Korea, which, as we record this podcast,
*02:03.940- 02:06.760* :  is preparing for the arrival of President Putin.
*02:07.380- 02:12.020* :  Last year, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia in a bulletproof train
*02:12.020- 02:13.300* :  to meet Vladimir Putin.
*02:13.300- 02:17.280* :  Now President Putin is on his way to Pyongyang for a reciprocal visit.
*02:17.720- 02:18.920* :  He's travelling by plane, though.
*02:19.420- 02:22.600* :  Beyond that, we know very little about the details of Mr. Putin's trip.
*02:22.640- 02:25.780* :  North Korea is one of the most secretive nations on Earth.
*02:26.340- 02:30.580* :  What we do know is that since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022,
*02:30.740- 02:33.640* :  the two men have become closer and closer.
*02:34.180- 02:37.000* :  Both countries are dealing with tough international sanctions.
*02:37.140- 02:43.860* :  Pyongyang has been accused of providing Moscow with munitions in return for aid and military technology.
*02:44.460- 02:48.300* :  Following events from the South Korean capital soul, Ishae Mahalil.
*02:48.900- 02:53.780* :  This is yet another grand gesture into this deepening alliance between the two pariah states.
*02:53.900- 02:59.480* :  I think it's seen by some observers as a thank you from Vladimir Putin to Kim Jong-un
*02:59.480- 03:04.260* :  for his enduring support for Russia's war in Ukraine since the beginning in a letter today.
*03:04.260- 03:09.480* :  Mr. Putin praised Pyongyang for firmly supporting Moscow's war in Ukraine,
*03:09.880- 03:10.780* :  worrying for the West.
*03:10.780- 03:16.240* :  Yes, worrying for Ukraine, definitely because it's a fact on the battlefield in this ongoing war.
*03:16.240- 03:21.040* :  Ukraine described it as a world's loneliest bromance and, of course, worrying for Seoul
*03:21.040- 03:26.420* :  because there are big questions about what an emboldened Kim Jong-un having received.
*03:26.460- 03:29.740* :  Vladimir Putin, we still don't know what he will be promised.
*03:29.740- 03:31.480* :  They extend to what he will be given.
*03:31.940- 03:35.260* :  But how will that affect the inter-Korean relationship,
*03:35.760- 03:39.580* :  especially at a time when tensions are really high on the border?
*03:39.580- 03:44.700* :  Remember, we've seen over the past two weeks or so these rubbish balloons that have traveled
*03:44.700- 03:45.800* :  from north to south.
*03:45.800- 03:50.560* :  That has pushed Seoul to scrap the 2018 military agreement with the north.
*03:50.980- 03:56.900* :  It has pushed them to resume the loudspeaker broadcasts, which really deeply angers the
*03:56.900- 03:57.200* :  north.
*03:57.680- 04:00.560* :  How will that play out once this visit is over?
*04:00.560- 04:04.620* :  How will that affect the relationship on the border that is increasingly tense?
*04:04.620- 04:08.900* :  I think for the two men, they know that each has something that the other needs.
*04:08.900- 04:13.660* :  I think Vladimir Putin and Russia are desperate for more munition to replenish a depleting
*04:13.660- 04:15.000* :  stockpile on the battlefield.
*04:15.520- 04:17.460* :  But North Korea, they need food.
*04:17.540- 04:18.300* :  They need fuel.
*04:18.300- 04:19.440* :  They need foreign currency.
*04:19.440- 04:24.660* :  They need satellite technology, especially after they fail to launch their spy satellite
*04:24.660- 04:25.440* :  into orbit.
*04:25.920- 04:30.660* :  Last month, so apart from the optics of this growing relationship that's worrying to everybody
*04:30.660- 04:35.020* :  around them, that it will be sold by those two men as, look, we're not pariah states.
*04:35.020- 04:36.760* :  We have friends that we can depend on.
*04:37.220- 04:41.180* :  It's also going to be interesting to watch what they can offer each other in the limitations
*04:41.180- 04:43.040* :  as well, to what they can give each other.
*04:43.460- 04:48.400* :  When you talk about the worries for officials in Seoul, how is it actually being covered
*04:48.400- 04:49.860* :  in South Korea?
*04:49.860- 04:51.640* :  What are South Korean people saying?
*04:52.520- 04:53.020* :  It's interesting.
*04:53.180- 04:56.000* :  The people that we've spoken to in South Korea, they have mixed feelings.
*04:56.000- 05:00.420* :  I think, for example, one gentleman that we spoke to has said, look, I know about the
*05:00.420- 05:00.720* :  visit.
*05:00.940- 05:05.800* :  I'm not necessarily worried because I know that North Korea, whatever it offers, Moscow
*05:05.800- 05:08.820* :  and Vladimir Putin, they're going to have China in mind.
*05:08.820- 05:14.880* :  So I think China as a deterrent of a deepening or a warly, deepening relationship is in
*05:14.880- 05:15.520* :  people's mind.
*05:16.060- 05:20.580* :  And just finally, it's always really hard to get information about what's going on in
*05:20.880- 05:21.480* :  North Korea.
*05:22.020- 05:24.400* :  How do you find out what's going on with this trip?
*05:24.400- 05:26.760* :  Are you dependent on North Korean state media?
*05:27.120- 05:27.500* :  Do you know what?
*05:27.500- 05:29.880* :  It's been speculation galore for days and days.
*05:29.880- 05:35.400* :  I can tell you, like in newsrooms in Seoul, in journalists gatherings, we've all been asking
*05:35.400- 05:36.200* :  each other that question.
*05:36.200- 05:41.220* :  I think you also depend on lines coming from Seoul, from KCNA, you're depending on lines
*05:41.220- 05:45.320* :  coming from TAS in Russia, and then good old watching planes.
*05:45.420- 05:50.540* :  What some of our colleagues are in the office right now, tracking planes going into Russia's
*05:50.540- 05:51.100* :  far east.
*05:51.100- 05:55.160* :  How long are they going to take, for example, to get into Pyongyang, which I think it's
*05:55.160- 05:58.580* :  worthy reminding our listeners as well of how unusual this is.
*05:58.660- 06:03.180* :  Normally in state visits, when a head of state is visiting another head of state in their
*06:03.180- 06:07.020* :  own country, you get an itinerary of what will be happening in advance.
*06:07.020- 06:11.960* :  This has left into a guessing game because, again, it's shrouded in secrecy and uncertainty,
*06:12.520- 06:15.460* :  which is customary, I think, if you're dealing with North Korea and Russia.
*06:16.140- 06:18.000* :  That was Shyma Khalil in Seoul.
*06:18.400- 06:22.160* :  And if you'd like to hear more about the relationship between Russia and North Korea,
*06:22.560- 06:27.740* :  you can listen to a new episode of the Global Story podcast, North Korea, why Putin and
*06:27.740- 06:29.380* :  Xi are courting Kim.
*06:29.380- 06:31.580* :  And you can find that wherever you get your podcasts.
*06:31.700- 06:33.300* :  Let's look for the Global Story.
*06:34.100- 06:39.980* :  Now to Thailand, where after years of campaigning by gay rights activists, same-sex marriage is
*06:39.980- 06:41.240* :  to become enshrined in law.
*06:41.760- 06:45.620* :  In March, the lower house of parliament passed the bill to give equal marriage rights to
*06:45.620- 06:49.360* :  same-sex couples, and it's now been passed by the upper house too.
*06:49.860- 06:54.720* :  It means Thailand becomes the only Southeast Asian country to recognize same-sex unions
*06:54.720- 06:57.580* :  and the third in Asia after Taiwan and Nepal.
*06:58.320- 07:02.140* :  Gay rights activists like Marsha Pornin celebrated their victory.
*07:02.880- 07:11.320* :  We face a lot of challenges, included some kind of hate crime, as the law do not protect
*07:11.340- 07:12.620* :  it our family.
*07:13.240- 07:19.420* :  But now we have support from the parliament, from the seniors that passed this law.
*07:19.900- 07:26.640* :  That means we are now protected by law, my wife and my daughters, who are then side-by-side
*07:26.640- 07:27.100* :  with me.
*07:27.260- 07:30.240* :  We are now achieved this law together.
*07:30.900- 07:32.900* :  So what will the law mean in practice?
*07:33.260- 07:36.580* :  A question for BBC ties, panesa and mocha in Bangkok.
*07:37.420- 07:39.460* :  First, they will be able to legally marry.
*07:39.940- 07:45.260* :  Secondly, they will be able to manage joyly of their earned or their beneficially-held
*07:45.260- 07:45.920* :  property.
*07:46.380- 07:50.160* :  Third, they will have the right to receive benefit and welfare from the state.
*07:50.180- 07:53.340* :  And fourth, they will have the consent for medical treatment.
*07:54.000- 07:56.980* :  And when will this come into force?
*07:56.980- 08:00.180* :  What needs to happen before it becomes recognised law?
*08:01.140- 08:06.440* :  Now, the King will sign into the law, and then it will be published on the lawyer's
*08:06.440- 08:06.700* :  set.
*08:07.180- 08:10.900* :  It should take in total 120 days to be annexed.
*08:11.280- 08:14.480* :  And is there still resistance, despite the passing of the law?
*08:14.480- 08:16.480* :  What sort of response is there in society?
*08:17.100- 08:23.180* :  Society as a whole, they are on the same page of pushing this law to be able to be induced
*08:23.780- 08:24.400* :  at the moment.
*08:24.400- 08:28.400* :  The Eho Mellage hashtag is trending number one on tight Twitter.
*08:28.940- 08:32.540* :  And the society is congratulating on the passing of the bill.
*08:32.940- 08:35.920* :  But it's quite unusual in South East Asia, isn't it?
*08:35.980- 08:39.800* :  This is not something that many other countries are doing in Asia.
*08:40.760- 08:41.040* :  Correct.
*08:41.340- 08:46.460* :  But even within the Senegal themselves, some of them want to use the word husband and
*08:46.460- 08:50.920* :  wife within the law as well, because the law eliminates the word husband and wife
*08:50.920- 08:54.620* :  and use the word spouses to make sure that it's gender neutral.
*08:55.140- 09:00.320* :  But some of the Senegal feel like the fact that they eliminate the word husband and wife
*09:00.320- 09:04.520* :  kind of put down people with different sex marriage.
*09:04.960- 09:11.240* :  But the LGBTQ advocate and NGOs has been fighting for the marriage law for quite sometimes
*09:11.240- 09:16.980* :  not only in just this year, it's been going on for like 20 years already.
*09:17.020- 09:21.400* :  So this is like such a stepping stone and a milestone to achieve for Taiwan.
*09:22.120- 09:27.440* :  Pennisa Mocha in Bangkok, there have been chaotic scenes in the Kenyan capital Nairobi
*09:27.440- 09:31.940* :  today as the police used tear gas and water cannon to try to break up protests.
*09:37.660- 09:42.060* :  They were protesting against plans to increase some taxes and introduce new ones.
*09:42.140- 09:44.740* :  Our correspondent Ann Saway is in Nairobi.
*09:45.320- 09:51.160* :  It has been quite dramatic in Nairobi today as protesters, mostly young people, converged
*09:51.160- 09:52.500* :  in different parts of the city.
*09:52.940- 09:56.640* :  They had planned to meet up in different points and then walk to parliament.
*09:56.640- 10:01.400* :  But then we saw the police arresting some of them from very early on.
*10:01.400- 10:06.960* :  However, they were able to regroup quickly and hold some demonstrations outside one of
*10:06.960- 10:08.660* :  the major media houses in the country.
*10:09.220- 10:12.060* :  But then the areas around parliament have been cordoned off.
*10:12.400- 10:14.500* :  So the confrontation is still ongoing.
*10:14.500- 10:18.760* :  The young people are determined, including some quite elderly people as well.
*10:18.760- 10:22.600* :  They are determined to make their voice heard and we have seen that the government has
*10:22.600- 10:27.040* :  backed down on some of the controversial new additions to the finance bill.
*10:27.480- 10:29.000* :  So what is it that they're also angry about?
*10:29.000- 10:30.240* :  Tell us about these new laws.
*10:30.880- 10:34.100* :  The government has proposed a raft of new taxes.
*10:34.100- 10:37.500* :  So additional taxes on some things that are already being taxed.
*10:37.780- 10:43.200* :  But also new ones, including a new motor vehicle tax, which they have now removed.
*10:43.240- 10:49.300* :  They had proposed imposed value added tax on bread, 16% that has now been removed.
*10:49.800- 10:55.340* :  They're also proposing new taxes on some of the newer industries like digital content
*10:55.380- 11:00.720* :  producers and people who basically are living through digital means.
*11:01.440- 11:07.200* :  And young people especially feel they're touched by this and have been protesting against
*11:07.200- 11:10.680* :  all these taxes saying that it just makes life more difficult for them.
*11:11.080- 11:16.340* :  And as you say, since the government has stepped back on some of the new taxes,
*11:17.280- 11:19.320* :  is it likely to give way on the others too?
*11:20.080- 11:24.760* :  Well, given that, you know, it's very unusual for government to back down as a result of
*11:24.840- 11:25.180* :  protest.
*11:25.300- 11:27.520* :  So it is something new.
*11:27.660- 11:33.260* :  And so we can't rule out it backing down on the other taxes that it is proposing as
*11:33.300- 11:33.480* :  well.
*11:33.860- 11:37.980* :  This bill is due to come up for its second reading in parliament tomorrow.
*11:38.520- 11:39.940* :  And their discussions continue.
*11:39.940- 11:44.660* :  They need to pass it by the end of the month so that the government has a budget to work
*11:44.720- 11:45.580* :  with Camgely.
*11:46.120- 11:48.000* :  So it's a race against time.
*11:48.000- 11:53.260* :  And I think this is a sign that we might see some more concessions from parliament.
*11:54.060- 11:55.640* :  That was Ann Saway in Nairobi.
*11:56.340- 12:01.300* :  The ancient hill town of Matera in southern Italy is one of the oldest in the world and
*12:01.300- 12:02.920* :  a UNESCO protected site.
*12:03.360- 12:09.380* :  Its streets are a warren of pale limestone churches, monasteries, palaces and houses
*12:09.380- 12:11.900* :  balanced on the edge of a steep ravine.
*12:12.580- 12:18.340* :  Now a British parkour runner has caused a lot of upset in Italy after a video appeared
*12:18.340- 12:22.840* :  of him jumping between buildings, apparently causing some masonry to collapse.
*12:23.420- 12:25.500* :  Our reporter Clizia Sala told us more.
*12:26.080- 12:31.920* :  A video was shared on social media showing the men attempting to vault from the roof of
*12:31.920- 12:38.220* :  an ancient building to the ledge of a nationed stonewalled house which basically crumbled
*12:38.220- 12:39.480* :  underneath him.
*12:39.900- 12:45.040* :  And because it was shared by a famous person, Luca Tomassini, who's a famous choreographer
*12:45.080- 12:50.100* :  in charge in talent shows, there have been lots of people commenting negatively on the
*12:50.220- 12:50.520* :  stunt.
*12:51.140- 12:54.720* :  And there has been quite a outpour of outrage on social media.
*12:55.300- 12:57.480* :  And he wrote, how dare you?
*12:57.480- 13:00.000* :  He wrote, you have no idea what you're doing.
*13:00.500- 13:06.020* :  And even though Matera maybe is not very well known as other cities in Italy like Venice,
*13:06.020- 13:09.760* :  like Florence, it is a UNESCO world heritage list.
*13:09.900- 13:13.660* :  And it was appointed as the European capital of culture in 2019.
*13:14.640- 13:20.600* :  So just to give you an idea of what it is like, the symbol of the city are the Sassi, which
*13:20.600- 13:21.700* :  translates to rocks.
*13:21.700- 13:27.840* :  But these are actually caves dug into the mountain where the local people used to live until
*13:27.840- 13:32.460* :  they were forced to settle in modern accommodation in the 1950s.
*13:32.960- 13:39.400* :  So back to our incident, it is unknown at the moment if police are investigating it, but
*13:39.400- 13:45.360* :  it has definitely been picked up by local media, as I was mentioning, social media.
*13:45.920- 13:51.560* :  And it's not the first time that visitors or tourists have damaged historic sites in Italy,
*13:51.560- 13:52.040* :  is it?
*13:52.360- 13:57.900* :  And actually the same parkour group did a similar stunt in Venice just last year.
*13:58.500- 14:04.680* :  The Mayor of Venice, with your bruneros, started a city-wide search and banned them after
*14:05.140- 14:09.520* :  they filmed themselves jumping from building to building and actually diving into the
*14:09.520- 14:10.440* :  canal's in Venice.
*14:11.160- 14:15.820* :  And they refused to leave the city, after which they were fined over $2,000.
*14:16.800- 14:21.980* :  And I think we can all remember when in June last year a tourist etched his name and his
*14:21.980- 14:27.800* :  girlfriend's name on the Colosseum, triggering the reaction of the Minister of Culture who
*14:27.800- 14:29.100* :  condemned the act.
*14:29.820- 14:32.280* :  There is a tension, isn't there, within Italy.
*14:32.620- 14:38.900* :  It has all of these very beautiful, very culturally important places, but there is a tension between
*14:39.140- 14:42.180* :  preserving those and welcoming and visitors.
*14:42.660- 14:50.120* :  There is definitely a dichotomy there, also from an economic standpoint, because tourism
*14:50.120- 14:54.580* :  represents the 5% of Italy's GDP, it's a huge number.
*14:55.240- 15:00.500* :  And so, authorities and people are kind of struggling to come to terms with tourism or
*15:00.500- 15:01.460* :  over-tourism.
*15:01.780- 15:03.680* :  Let's just take the example of Matera.
*15:04.440- 15:09.980* :  In Matera, there have been lots of, for example, films that have been shot in the past years.
*15:09.980- 15:15.760* :  It has been a backdrop for Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ, for the James Bond feature
*15:15.760- 15:16.740* :  not time to die.
*15:17.480- 15:23.440* :  But then, when it comes to attracting tourists, it's kind of difficult to find a way to create
*15:23.440- 15:26.900* :  a more sustainable and more beneficial tourism.
*15:27.720- 15:28.500* :  Kielitsya Sala.
*15:29.260- 15:33.680* :  One of the great figures of French and Italian cinema in the years after the Second World
*15:33.680- 15:36.460* :  War, the actress Anouk Amé, has died.
*15:36.460- 15:37.620* :  She was 92.
*15:38.300- 15:43.060* :  Although she worked with Star Directors in Italy and the United States, as Peter Hyatt
*15:43.060- 15:46.440* :  reports, it was probably for a French movie that she was best known.
*15:53.780- 15:58.400* :  Claude Luce's film Anouk Amé and Sam, a man and a woman, was a romantic drama that
*15:58.400- 16:00.000* :  tugged heartstrings around the world.
*16:00.660- 16:04.400* :  Anouk Amé played the young widow who falls in love with another parent at her child's
*16:04.440- 16:05.800* :  school, himself a widower.
*16:06.060- 16:07.680* :  Oh, I can't wait to be an original.
*16:08.420- 16:12.460* :  You know, there is a meeting, a marriage, a child, there are things that happen a lot
*16:13.820- 16:13.920* :  of people.
*16:13.920- 16:18.080* :  With its lush photography and haunting music, the film scooped a hat full of awards and
*16:18.080- 16:21.120* :  cemented Anouk Amé's place in the front rank of European cinema.
*16:21.980- 16:26.160* :  Her enigmatic beauty and understated acting had already seen her feature in Felini's
*16:26.180- 16:28.060* :  La Dolce Vita and eight and a half.
*16:28.700- 16:32.760* :  And as she told the BBC many years later, she was able to pick and choose who she worked
*16:32.760- 16:33.660* :  with and on what.
*16:33.940- 16:41.920* :  I think my luxury is to be able to try to do things I like and to accept things I like
*16:41.920- 16:44.980* :  and that's very, very nice.
*16:45.400- 16:50.040* :  Born Nicole Dreyfus in Paris, she adopted her stage-dame after making her first film
*16:50.100- 16:51.060* :  at the age of 14.
*16:51.700- 16:56.400* :  The 70 or so that followed included work with directors like Bernardo Bertolucci, Robert
*16:56.400- 16:57.860* :  Altman and Annie's father.
*16:58.780- 17:03.720* :  But it was Anom Aune fam that ran through her professional life with two sequels, one
*17:03.720- 17:06.660* :  set 20 years later and the other half a century later.
*17:07.380- 17:08.920* :  That was the last film she made.
*17:14.420- 17:17.380* :  Peter Hart on the life of Anouk Amé, who has died.
*17:20.000- 17:21.460* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*17:22.180- 17:27.960* :  I think it's a really good start to have a warning label to raise awareness of these
*17:27.960- 17:28.380* :  issues.
*17:29.160- 17:31.040* :  I think we can and should go further.
*17:31.460- 17:34.860* :  Calls for mental health warnings on social media platforms.
*17:43.100- 17:46.100* :  One size fits all seemed like a good idea for clothes.
*17:46.340- 17:46.840* :  Nice dress.
*17:47.240- 17:48.760* :  It's a t-shirt.
*17:49.320- 17:50.340* :  Until you try it on.
*17:50.900- 17:52.080* :  Same goes for your healthcare.
*17:52.580- 17:57.340* :  That's why United Healthcare offers a variety of flexible, budget-friendly coverage for
*17:57.340- 17:59.460* :  medical, vision, dental and more.
*17:59.500- 18:04.220* :  So whether you're between jobs, coming off a parent's plan, or even missed open enrollment,
*18:04.740- 18:06.800* :  you can find the plan that fits you best.
*18:07.160- 18:12.240* :  Find out more about United Healthcare coverage at UH1.com, that's UH1.com.
*18:13.080- 18:13.800* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*18:13.800- 18:17.760* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*18:18.100- 18:19.100* :  They charge you a lot.
*18:19.140- 18:20.440* :  We charge you a little.
*18:20.760- 18:24.880* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*18:24.880- 18:28.160* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*18:28.460- 18:28.800* :  That's right.
*18:28.940- 18:33.420* :  We're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*18:33.860- 18:36.320* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*18:36.660- 18:39.600* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees, promulure for new customers for limited
*18:39.600- 18:42.620* :  time, unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month, slows, full turns at MintMobile.com.
*18:48.140- 18:52.360* :  Now spare a thought for the athletes training for the Paris Olympics beginning next month.
*18:52.460- 18:59.460* :  A report entitled Rings of Fire compiled by Olympians, climate scientists and physiologists
*18:59.980- 19:05.820* :  warns that intense heat could mean exhaustion, collapse and worst case scenario, even death.
*19:06.520- 19:11.180* :  Summer temperatures above 30 degrees in Paris are becoming increasingly frequent.
*19:11.180- 19:16.820* :  Jamie Farndale, the captain of Great Britain's Rugby 7's team, says the dangers are clear.
*19:17.800- 19:21.840* :  By myself, I've had experience of the mates who've suffered with heat stroke,
*19:22.120- 19:26.260* :  intense, you know, it's a big problem and there's a lot of top athletes that have spoken out about
*19:26.740- 19:29.860* :  the impacts of heat, so we're concerned about our health.
*19:30.100- 19:34.360* :  You know, we're not going to stop pushing ourselves, especially on the biggest stage when,
*19:34.360- 19:38.880* :  you know, all you want to do is when our sports reporter David Lockwood told us what the reports
*19:38.880- 19:40.220* :  suggesting should be done.
*19:40.900- 19:46.560* :  I think the report is hoping for free things to be done in response to the possibility of extreme heat.
*19:46.560- 19:48.340* :  First of all, is scheduling.
*19:48.340- 19:53.940* :  It's arranging some of these more endurance events at times of the day, when it's cooler,
*19:54.440- 19:56.040* :  when it's less likely to impact athletes.
*19:56.040- 19:57.940* :  That already happens to a certain extent.
*19:57.940- 20:03.520* :  We saw in the Tokyo Olympics, the marathon was moved 800 kilometres north to Sapporo,
*20:04.260- 20:05.920* :  which had cooler temperatures than Tokyo.
*20:06.500- 20:09.940* :  At the World Athletics Championships in Doha, we saw a midnight marathon.
*20:10.560- 20:14.860* :  So that is happening, but that's harder for sports like tennis, where you've got loads of
*20:14.860- 20:19.260* :  matches, knockout stages and they need to be competing all throughout.
*20:19.260- 20:22.480* :  A marathon is obviously just the men's marathon, the women's marathon.
*20:23.000- 20:26.840* :  The other thing I think they want done is is they want more athletes to speak up and sports
*20:26.840- 20:30.320* :  bodies to be aware of this and to speak out on it.
*20:30.640- 20:35.100* :  They want athletes kept safe and that means mitigation like shaded areas,
*20:35.100- 20:40.640* :  fans being provided, even sometimes water sprays, water vapors to call the athletes down.
*20:40.640- 20:43.900* :  And I think also there's an element of this report that is speaking out against
*20:44.560- 20:49.080* :  sports own footprints, sports own emissions that are making global warming even worse.
*20:49.720- 20:53.180* :  And as we heard from Jamie, the athletes work so hard at their sport.
*20:53.460- 20:55.500* :  You're not going to be able to stop competitors competing.
*20:55.560- 20:57.520* :  Can they train for this?
*20:57.980- 21:01.840* :  Absolutely. So the physiologists and the scientists in the report do say that a
*21:01.840- 21:07.200* :  climatisation and preparation are the best possible ways to try and limit the impacts of the
*21:07.200- 21:09.280* :  heat and it's not just heat, let's remember it's humidity.
*21:09.800- 21:12.540* :  So increasingly we're seeing Olympic athletes especially
*21:13.060- 21:15.480* :  factoring this into their training. They will be going to
*21:15.900- 21:19.900* :  heat labs where these conditions are simulated and preparing
*21:19.940- 21:24.420* :  for events like rowing, for cycling, for running, and marathon, and long distance races.
*21:24.420- 21:27.320* :  But again, it's harder perhaps for tennis players,
*21:27.320- 21:29.720* :  harder perhaps for some of the team's sports to prepare,
*21:30.420- 21:32.360* :  because they're playing in a team environment.
*21:32.360- 21:36.140* :  Their schedules are busier, you know, an athlete preparing for an Olympics.
*21:36.140- 21:40.320* :  That's the pinnacle of their sport, but footballers and tennis players compete all year round.
*21:40.840- 21:44.140* :  So a climatisation is important. The other thing that's important to say is that
*21:44.380- 21:47.640* :  that's just the athletes. This is a really important issue for the welfare of
*21:47.640- 21:52.620* :  fans as well and it's much harder for fans and officials and other people to prepare
*21:52.620- 21:55.780* :  and they're arguably even more risk than athletes because they're not as fit.
*21:56.480- 22:02.440* :  David Lockwood, to China now, where torrential rain and landslides in various provinces have
*22:02.440- 22:07.780* :  killed at least nine people, more than 20 are missing. But in other areas, the authorities
*22:07.780- 22:12.760* :  have had to issue drought warnings as parts of the country suffer from a prolonged heat wave.
*22:13.200- 22:15.280* :  Here's our China correspondence, Laura Bicca.
*22:15.980- 22:20.060* :  Photos from Hernan province show farmers desperately trying to revive
*22:20.060- 22:25.620* :  millions of hectares of parched brown land as the region suffers from a severe drought.
*22:26.300- 22:29.220* :  70% less rain than normal has fallen on Hernan.
*22:29.220- 22:33.680* :  But in southern and coastal provinces, the problem is too much rain.
*22:34.120- 22:39.720* :  Floods and landslides have killed nine people and tens of thousands of others have been evacuated
*22:39.720- 22:44.580* :  as heavy rain has swollen rivers. In the northwestern province of Xinjiang,
*22:44.580- 22:48.320* :  flash floods engulfed a car and four people are missing.
*22:48.320- 22:52.020* :  The central weather station has warned that the heavy rain will continue
*22:52.380- 22:55.780* :  and they expect twice as much to fall this summer than in a normal year.
*22:56.480- 23:01.520* :  Laura Bicca, one of the most senior health officials in the US has called on the country to
*23:01.520- 23:05.760* :  impose smoking-style warning labels on social media platforms.
*23:05.760- 23:11.520* :  The surgeon General Vivek Murthy said social media increased the risk that children would
*23:11.520- 23:16.900* :  experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. He wants the platforms to show a message to say
*23:16.900- 23:21.100* :  that they're associated with significant mental health harms for adolescence.
*23:21.480- 23:25.960* :  Dr. Jean Twainy, author of several books on young people and technology,
*23:25.960- 23:31.540* :  including I. Jan and generations, spoke to a moral margin about how it's affecting their lives.
*23:32.460- 23:39.920* :  In the US and the UK and across Europe, we are seeing a huge increase in depression among teens.
*23:39.920- 23:45.320* :  And that happened right at the time that smartphones and social media became popular.
*23:46.240- 23:53.460* :  We also know that the more hours a day teens spends on social media, the more likely it is that
*23:53.460- 24:00.020* :  they are going to be depressed. And there's now also an increasing number of experiments
*24:00.940- 24:04.980* :  that can show causation. For example, when people give up or cut back on social media,
*24:05.560- 24:10.480* :  they're happier. They're less likely to be depressed than those who keep up their normal levels
*24:10.480- 24:18.280* :  of social media use. There are many, many mechanisms. It's one of the reasons why the rise of social media
*24:18.280- 24:24.520* :  is such a strong candidate for being the cause of the adolescent mental health crisis.
*24:25.360- 24:33.060* :  There's the displacement of time when they're spending five, six, seven hours a day on social
*24:33.060- 24:38.400* :  media. They're spending less time with their friends and family face to face. They're spending
*24:38.400- 24:45.240* :  less time sleeping, not a good formula for mental health. Then there's all of the content that they
*24:45.240- 24:51.540* :  see online. That teen girls and young women, for example, are seeing these perfect bodies on
*24:51.540- 24:56.620* :  Instagram. And that can lead to body image issues. And then that can lead to depression. Then
*24:56.620- 25:01.480* :  there's also a lot of bullying and negativity, which also isn't good for mental health.
*25:01.640- 25:04.800* :  That's just the tip of the iceberg for some of the possible mechanisms.
*25:04.800- 25:09.320* :  So what do you make then in that context of this idea from the surgeon general for warning labels
*25:09.320- 25:14.960* :  on social media platforms? I think it's a really good start to have a warning label to raise awareness.
*25:15.960- 25:22.060* :  Of these issues. I think we can and should go further. The minimum age for social media
*25:22.060- 25:27.840* :  is 13. It really should be more like 16. And age should really be verified because at the
*25:27.840- 25:33.740* :  moment, it's not the BBC has approached YouTube TikTok X and meta, which owns Facebook and
*25:33.740- 25:38.420* :  Instagram for comment. We've not heard back yet. But in general, these platforms say they take
*25:38.420- 25:44.460* :  very extensive measures to try to protect children both by requiring age verification and then
*25:44.460- 25:48.560* :  limiting the amount of content that they can see, which could be harmful to them. What do you
*25:48.560- 25:53.920* :  make of that defense from the technology companies? Well, that's news to me because my understanding
*25:53.920- 25:59.140* :  is all you have to do is check a box saying you're 13 or live at your birthday and you're on.
*25:59.500- 26:05.680* :  And we know from extensive survey data, at least here in the US, that many, many nine, 10,
*26:05.680- 26:12.420* :  11 and 12 year olds who are not supposed to be on these platforms have used them and many have
*26:12.420- 26:18.740* :  their own accounts and spend hours and hours a day on them. That was Dr. Jean Twange. And finally,
*26:31.380- 26:37.260* :  that is Haitian American singer-songwriter Leila McCalla. Her music is inspired by Haiti's rich
*26:37.260- 26:43.400* :  cultural and musical traditions as well as the country's complex history. Haiti has suffered two
*26:43.400- 26:48.580* :  centuries of turmoil since becoming the first country in the Caribbean to win its independence
*26:48.580- 26:55.500* :  after a slave revolt forced France out. But freedom came at a terrible price, including being
*26:55.500- 27:01.340* :  forced to pay the equivalent of billions of dollars in reparations to France. Leila counts a
*27:01.340- 27:07.160* :  former president among her fans and is currently on tour in North America and Europe. She spoke to the
*27:07.160- 27:12.640* :  BBC's Martin Bernard and began by telling him about her new album, The Song Without the Heat.
*27:22.960- 27:31.560* :  The title track is inspired by the great abolitionist, Fredrick Douglas, who worked tirelessly to end
*27:31.960- 27:39.520* :  slavery in the United States and was enslaved to himself. He just had such a beautiful poetry to talk
*27:39.520- 27:46.300* :  about creating social change and really what true liberation meant. And so I borrowed some of his
*27:46.480- 27:52.540* :  words and wrote a song. It says, you want the crops without the plow, you want the rain without the
*27:52.540- 27:58.960* :  thunder, and you want the ocean without the roar of its waters. To me, I feel like that those words
*27:58.960- 28:15.080* :  are talking about the pain and tension of transformation. You talked about slavery and the abolition
*28:15.080- 28:21.120* :  of slavery. Your parents came from Haiti. Is there a Haitian influence on this album?
*28:22.000- 28:28.180* :  I think Haiti is something that always lives in my music. My perspective is very much shaped
*28:28.180- 28:33.660* :  from having Haitian ancestors knowing that Haiti was the first independent black nation. In the
*28:33.660- 28:39.700* :  Western hemisphere and the first successful slave rebellion, the only successful slave rebellion
*28:40.300- 28:45.860* :  that resulted in the founding of a nation that comes through in my songwriting.
*28:55.260- 29:00.080* :  These songs that are on some without the heat are all in English, but all of my records I've
*29:00.080- 29:05.100* :  been singing in Creole and English in French and exploring my Haitian roots.
*29:12.380- 29:17.800* :  Haiti has been in the news a lot this year. It's been through a hugely traumatic situation with
*29:17.800- 29:22.620* :  gang violence and political turmoil. What are your thoughts about what's going on there?
*29:22.880- 29:31.160* :  I think at the root of it is Haiti's struggle for political sovereignty and freedom from
*29:31.560- 29:36.080* :  Western powers. There's a lot of corruption that has stemmed from that. There's a lot of
*29:36.080- 29:44.540* :  impunity. It's tragic, it's sad, it's heartbreaking, but I do feel that there is more conversation about
*29:44.840- 29:51.940* :  how to really have Haitian people in charge of their own affairs. That gives me some hope.
*29:52.500- 29:56.120* :  Have you ever played in Haiti? Have you ever performed there?
*29:56.420- 30:02.520* :  I performed in Haiti in 2017 for a festival called Grand Conte de la Music, which is an annual
*30:02.520- 30:08.160* :  festival that brings artists to Haiti and so that was the last time I was in Haiti and I hope to
*30:08.160- 30:18.660* :  go back sometimes here. I believe former president Barack Obama is a fan of yours.
*30:19.240- 30:23.600* :  I sure hope so. I ended up on his end of the year playlist, best of playlists.
*30:25.280- 30:32.060* :  But yeah, there's a Haitian song that I covered called Do Dine that ended up on a year end list.
*30:36.260- 30:38.880* :  Laila Maccala, they're speaking to Martin Venard.
*30:41.740- 30:45.600* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
