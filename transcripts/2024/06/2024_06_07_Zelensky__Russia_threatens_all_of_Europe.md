*01:26.760- 01:31.900* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 7th of June.
*01:31.900- 01:36.740* :  The Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky tells French MPs that Russian aggression is a threat
*01:36.740- 01:42.040* :  to the whole of Europe. The British Prime Minister Rishisunak is forced to apologize for leaving
*01:42.140- 01:48.000* :  commemorations early and three football fans have been arrested in Hong Kong for remaining seated
*01:48.480- 01:50.840* :  while the Chinese national anthem was played.
*01:54.020- 01:59.300* :  Also in the podcast, it calls the drama the biggest lie in television history about the fact
*01:59.300- 02:04.560* :  that it says it's a true story and it says that she's an innocent woman defamed by Netflix
*02:04.560- 02:09.980* :  at a magnitude and scale without precedent. A woman claiming to have inspired the drama
*02:09.980- 02:13.980* :  baby reindeer soos Netflix for $170 million.
*02:19.820- 02:23.720* :  The presence of the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky at yesterday's D-Day
*02:23.720- 02:28.660* :  commemorations in northern France coupled with the absence of Vladimir Putin
*02:28.660- 02:33.780* :  was a stark reminder that eight decades on war has returned to Europe.
*02:33.780- 02:39.260* :  One of the most memorable scenes from the event in Normandy came when a Canadian D-Day veteran
*02:39.260- 02:44.220* :  told President Zelensky he was a hero for standing up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*02:56.660- 03:01.600* :  Well today President Zelensky was honoured by the French state greeted by the Defence Minister
*03:02.140- 03:05.780* :  in Paris where a band played Ukrainian national anthem.
*03:17.360- 03:22.220* :  After that the Ukrainian leader moved on to the national assembly in Paris where he was given
*03:22.220- 03:26.500* :  a standing ovation by MPs before delivering this message.
*03:31.680- 03:38.300* :  We live in a time when Europe is no longer a continent of peace, unfortunately.
*03:38.300- 03:42.600* :  We live in a time when Nazism is making a comeback, unfortunately.
*03:43.320- 03:49.540* :  When in Europe again cities are being completely destroyed and villages are being burned.
*03:49.540- 03:54.240* :  When there are against filtration camps deportations and hatred in Europe
*03:54.720- 03:57.180* :  which has become a new Russian cult.
*03:57.940- 04:02.500* :  Staying in France, President Zelensky went on to meet the US President Joe Biden
*04:02.500- 04:06.620* :  who apologised for delays to the delivery of military aid to Ukraine.
*04:06.700- 04:10.200* :  I heard more from my Europe regional editor, Danny Eberhardt.
*04:10.860- 04:15.880* :  This is an opportunity this meeting for the two sides to again reaffirm their unity.
*04:16.460- 04:21.600* :  First of all, President Biden in opening remarks to the press praised Ukraine's resilience,
*04:21.600- 04:26.940* :  as he called that remarkable, and the optics of this are important because
*04:27.420- 04:32.080* :  it's just over a week before a major peace conference is staged in Switzerland.
*04:32.080- 04:35.080* :  But President Biden won't be attending that.
*04:35.080- 04:38.560* :  That's of course a lot of regret in Kiev.
*04:39.020- 04:44.800* :  So this is a chance for it to say, look, I'm here, the US is standing behind Ukraine.
*04:45.380- 04:48.500* :  That is important and President Zelensky chose to emphasise the positive.
*04:48.800- 04:51.560* :  He thanked the US, for example, that the Vice President is turning up,
*04:51.560- 04:54.880* :  although secretly, of course, he really wants President Biden to be there
*04:55.200- 04:58.040* :  to show that the world is united against Russia.
*04:58.540- 04:59.500* :  So that's important.
*04:59.780- 05:04.220* :  President Biden did apologise, as you mentioned, to President Zelensky for the delays
*05:04.220- 05:08.600* :  in getting this large package of US aid, military aid through Congress.
*05:08.600- 05:09.740* :  It was passed in April.
*05:10.360- 05:15.620* :  And he said that it didn't undermine the fact that the US was standing with Kiev.
*05:16.000- 05:18.940* :  Yeah, another $200 million or so promise today.
*05:18.940- 05:21.800* :  And also France is going to help Ukraine.
*05:21.860- 05:25.580* :  Take us through what Ukraine will be getting out of these meetings.
*05:26.540- 05:29.440* :  Well, Ukraine, President Zelensky, spoke at the National Assembly,
*05:29.440- 05:32.780* :  so that was again important for the symbolism of this all
*05:32.780- 05:37.460* :  and really making use of the opportunity that the D-Day commemorations give.
*05:38.020- 05:41.100* :  But they're on the practical level where President Zelensky is meeting
*05:41.100- 05:43.980* :  arms manufacturers as a meeting with a tank manufacturer,
*05:43.980- 05:47.560* :  Franco German one, he's also holding talks with President Macron.
*05:47.560- 05:51.160* :  President Macron has said that France will sell Ukraine,
*05:51.160- 05:53.360* :  Mirage jets, advanced combat jets,
*05:53.940- 05:55.940* :  and also they'll be providing loans.
*05:56.100- 05:57.000* :  So the two will meet.
*05:57.000- 06:00.000* :  It's an opportunity for them to underline once again,
*06:00.000- 06:02.480* :  that France is very much in the forefront of this.
*06:02.940- 06:05.180* :  Are you're a regional editor, Danny Eberhard?
*06:05.900- 06:09.720* :  Well, the D-Day anniversary has had lots of coverage here in the UK
*06:09.720- 06:12.980* :  when newspaper headlines like in the footsteps of heroes
*06:13.480- 06:15.020* :  and they gave us freedom.
*06:15.020- 06:18.780* :  It's a reflection of the importance of the Normandy landings
*06:18.820- 06:20.780* :  to 20th century British history.
*06:21.400- 06:24.320* :  But it's emerged that the Prime Minister, Rishisunak,
*06:24.560- 06:26.780* :  left northern France early yesterday,
*06:26.780- 06:29.740* :  missing the main commemoration involving world leaders,
*06:30.380- 06:33.340* :  in order to do a pre-recorded election interview.
*06:33.760- 06:38.820* :  He was mocked online and criticized by fellow conservatives and opponents alike.
*06:39.560- 06:41.180* :  This was the leader of the opposition,
*06:41.260- 06:43.680* :  Keir Starmer, who did attend the ceremony.
*06:44.420- 06:48.740* :  Those veterans had made the most incredible effort to be there.
*06:49.380- 06:51.960* :  I thought it was really important for me to be there.
*06:52.320- 06:55.020* :  Now, Rishisunak will have to answer his own actions.
*06:55.120- 06:57.020* :  For me, there was nowhere else I was going to be.
*06:57.460- 07:00.700* :  Well, the Rau has prompted Mr. Sunak to issue the following apology.
*07:01.060- 07:04.740* :  Having fully participated in all the British events with British veterans,
*07:04.740- 07:07.580* :  I returned home before the international leaders event.
*07:07.580- 07:10.520* :  That was a mistake, and I apologise for that.
*07:10.800- 07:14.380* :  But I will always be proud of our record in supporting veterans here in the UK.
*07:14.380- 07:17.420* :  We have a dedicated office for veterans affairs, the first
*07:17.860- 07:20.840* :  veterans minister sitting in cabinet and a range of programmes
*07:20.840- 07:24.160* :  to support them with health, housing, employment needs.
*07:24.740- 07:26.700* :  That's something that I've worked very personally on,
*07:26.700- 07:28.540* :  because it's personally important to me.
*07:28.820- 07:30.940* :  And as I said yesterday and the day before,
*07:30.940- 07:33.700* :  I had the privilege of speaking with many veterans and their families
*07:33.700- 07:37.280* :  to express my personal gratitude to them for their service to our country
*07:37.280- 07:40.000* :  and to honour what they and their colleagues have done for us.
*07:40.260- 07:44.320* :  Rishisunak, the Rau comes less than four weeks before the British election,
*07:44.320- 07:47.140* :  which has seen the Conservatives campaign on defence,
*07:47.140- 07:49.840* :  including a promise to reinstate national service.
*07:50.520- 07:51.960* :  So, what should we make of it all?
*07:52.080- 07:54.960* :  I asked our UK political correspondent, Rob Watson.
*07:55.580- 08:01.220* :  It does seem the most astonishing era to make in a general election campaign.
*08:01.220- 08:04.640* :  I mean, in one wonders how an earth could have happened.
*08:04.640- 08:07.020* :  But then, I guess the subsequent question is,
*08:07.540- 08:10.280* :  is this, as some would say, a storm and a teacup,
*08:10.280- 08:13.820* :  which will be forgotten by the end of the campaign in a few weeks' time,
*08:14.420- 08:16.660* :  or is there something far more damaging?
*08:16.920- 08:19.100* :  I mean, I suspect it's a bit of both,
*08:19.100- 08:22.400* :  that it isn't mentally damaging in the short term,
*08:22.400- 08:24.920* :  because it means the voters, the media,
*08:24.920- 08:28.780* :  the oppositional all-focusing on this blunder by Rishisunak.
*08:29.160- 08:33.060* :  Will in the end it be a decisive factor in whether the Conservatives win
*08:33.640- 08:35.260* :  or heavily lose the election?
*08:35.260- 08:37.680* :  I suspect it probably won't count for much.
*08:37.860- 08:41.300* :  But D-Day is such an important part of the British psyche,
*08:41.300- 08:46.600* :  and particularly for the older voters that the Conservatives have been targeting.
*08:46.600- 08:48.520* :  So, losing their core support.
*08:48.520- 08:52.020* :  Sure, Oliver. I mean, that's why even Conservatives are saying,
*08:52.020- 08:53.980* :  this is an astonishing blunder.
*08:54.000- 08:57.860* :  I mean, I think there are very few of the millions of people in Britain
*08:57.860- 09:00.520* :  who watched any of the media coverage of the commemorations
*09:00.620- 09:02.840* :  who won't have had moist eyes.
*09:02.840- 09:05.520* :  I mean, when you see the survivors,
*09:05.900- 09:07.700* :  the veterans are still able to go there,
*09:07.700- 09:11.720* :  the idea that a Prime Minister would in some way miss any of it
*09:11.720- 09:12.940* :  is pretty inexplicable.
*09:12.940- 09:17.160* :  And as you say, the Conservatives' absolute core base of voters
*09:17.160- 09:19.440* :  is people who are 65 and over,
*09:19.780- 09:22.740* :  the very people who will have been watching all the coverage
*09:23.160- 09:24.620* :  and who care most about this.
*09:24.620- 09:28.880* :  I mean, that is why Conservatives are tearing their hair out over this.
*09:29.280- 09:31.280* :  Now, the man who's the main opposition leader,
*09:31.280- 09:34.380* :  hoping to be Rishi Sunak's replacement as Prime Minister,
*09:34.380- 09:35.440* :  is a care stammer.
*09:35.440- 09:38.220* :  Was at that event mingling with world leaders,
*09:38.380- 09:40.440* :  including Vladimir Zelensky?
*09:40.440- 09:43.900* :  Would much change on British policy on Ukraine
*09:43.900- 09:46.000* :  if the Labour Party does win the election?
*09:46.560- 09:48.460* :  The short answer to that is no.
*09:48.460- 09:50.880* :  And indeed, in most areas of foreign policy,
*09:50.880- 09:54.600* :  it wouldn't change because foreign policy is determined far more
*09:54.600- 09:57.060* :  by British history, geography, security,
*09:57.700- 09:58.800* :  and economic interests.
*09:58.800- 10:02.000* :  So, I mean, I think Mr. Stan will try and make closer relations
*10:02.000- 10:03.160* :  with the European Union,
*10:03.160- 10:05.560* :  but I think on issues like Ukraine,
*10:05.560- 10:09.060* :  I think the position would be pretty much identical to what it is now.
*10:09.520- 10:11.800* :  Our political correspondent, Rob Watson,
*10:12.140- 10:14.020* :  and a reminder that if you have a question
*10:14.020- 10:15.860* :  about the British general election,
*10:16.480- 10:17.540* :  we'd like to hear from you.
*10:17.780- 10:22.080* :  Please email us on global podcast at bbc.co.uk
*10:22.080- 10:25.820* :  or you can find us on x at Global NewsPod,
*10:25.960- 10:27.500* :  and we look forward to hearing from you.
*10:27.760- 10:29.820* :  The United Nations Children's Agency
*10:29.820- 10:31.860* :  says the high number of young people killed
*10:31.860- 10:34.780* :  in a massacre in central Sudan on Wednesday
*10:35.420- 10:38.640* :  shows that children are paying the price of the civil war there.
*10:39.140- 10:44.240* :  UNICEF said 35 children were among the more than 150 reported victims
*10:44.740- 10:46.820* :  in Ward, Al-Noura, which was attacked by
*10:46.820- 10:49.180* :  the paramilitary rapid support forces.
*10:49.260- 10:52.940* :  The group said it was targeting an army base in the area.
*10:53.480- 10:56.220* :  Mary Louise Eagleton is the deputy representative
*10:56.220- 10:57.980* :  for UNICEF in Port Sudan.
*10:58.760- 11:01.740* :  So there are 24 million children in Sudan.
*11:02.040- 11:06.300* :  Each and every one of them has been impacted by this horrific war.
*11:06.540- 11:09.300* :  We estimate that at least 14 million children
*11:09.300- 11:12.480* :  are in dire need of humanitarian assistance.
*11:12.540- 11:16.620* :  More than 5 million children now have fled
*11:16.620- 11:18.760* :  with their families from their homes.
*11:18.760- 11:20.160* :  They have lost everything.
*11:20.160- 11:21.500* :  They have lost friends.
*11:21.540- 11:23.180* :  They've lost family members.
*11:23.580- 11:26.600* :  And they've been during scars that will last a lifetime.
*11:27.560- 11:32.760* :  Their situation is terrifying for millions of these millions of children.
*11:33.260- 11:34.700* :  They've left everything behind.
*11:34.700- 11:37.100* :  And the economy is collapsing.
*11:37.100- 11:40.980* :  There's no economic means for their parents to work
*11:40.980- 11:42.140* :  and earn an income.
*11:42.820- 11:46.220* :  19 million children, that's the entire school-aged population,
*11:46.360- 11:49.080* :  have not been able to go to school now as to make.
*11:49.580- 11:51.360* :  Thanks to some schools reopening.
*11:51.360- 11:56.500* :  And some must say, 17 million children still are lost for 14 months in.
*11:56.900- 11:58.420* :  Mary Louise Eagleton.
*11:58.700- 12:01.840* :  Well over the past few months, the BBC has been hearing from people
*12:02.280- 12:02.960* :  inside Sudan.
*12:02.960- 12:05.600* :  One is Ahmed from the capital Khartoum.
*12:05.900- 12:08.520* :  And he has been sending regular audio diaries
*12:08.900- 12:10.720* :  about inflation, food kitchens,
*12:10.720- 12:12.940* :  and how hungry his children are.
*12:13.360- 12:14.580* :  Here is his latest dispatch.
*12:15.940- 12:19.500* :  Hello, this is Ahmed from Khartoum, the city of Ahmedaman.
*12:20.100- 12:21.360* :  About four weeks ago,
*12:21.940- 12:25.940* :  one of key Sudanese army officers active on social media sites
*12:25.940- 12:28.040* :  published what he described then
*12:28.060- 12:31.700* :  as good news for people living in the walls of a uniformed man.
*12:32.160- 12:36.300* :  My wife and I thought the good news was on an upcoming peace agreement
*12:37.080- 12:38.880* :  or major victories by the army,
*12:39.360- 12:43.860* :  or at least a ceasefire that temporarily silenced the sounds of guns.
*12:44.340- 12:48.720* :  The good news the officer conveyed was a congratulatory message
*12:49.380- 12:52.480* :  for people in on demand that they could now bury the loved ones
*12:52.480- 12:55.800* :  at the main cemetery after liberating the area
*12:55.800- 12:58.180* :  from the paramilitary rapid support forces.
*12:58.740- 13:01.040* :  Both of us were shocked for a minute
*13:01.100- 13:05.520* :  and wondered how that could be considered good news by the officer.
*13:05.940- 13:08.760* :  During the past 14 months, homes, schools,
*13:08.760- 13:12.020* :  and public playgrounds were turned into graveyards
*13:12.660- 13:15.460* :  because it was not possible by both warring sites
*13:15.460- 13:17.000* :  to reach the cemeteries.
*13:17.520- 13:20.160* :  In the past, we used to go to the cemeteries
*13:20.680- 13:24.220* :  but since the war cemeteries came from the door.
*13:24.900- 13:28.860* :  As a result of this ban, I was not able to visit my father's grave.
*13:29.220- 13:31.680* :  I said to my wife, at least the good news
*13:31.680- 13:35.160* :  is that I can finally visit my father at the cemetery.
*13:36.140- 13:38.780* :  On the day I decided to go to the cemetery,
*13:39.500- 13:43.120* :  a group of volunteers and family members began relocating
*13:43.740- 13:46.060* :  some of the graves at schools, homes,
*13:46.060- 13:48.760* :  and public playgrounds to the main cemetery.
*13:49.200- 13:51.100* :  Among those is my friend's father
*13:51.100- 13:54.040* :  who died in a tragic way when artillery
*13:54.040- 13:55.720* :  shall land it on their house.
*13:56.180- 13:59.600* :  The family decided to bury him in front of their main door
*13:59.600- 14:02.440* :  to keep his soul closer to them.
*14:03.140- 14:05.200* :  I decided to give them a hand
*14:05.200- 14:07.680* :  and join the volunteers to the cemetery.
*14:08.640- 14:12.000* :  As we were removing his body, my friend was in tears
*14:12.740- 14:16.400* :  as if his father had just died, not five months ago.
*14:16.700- 14:20.500* :  We headed to the graveyard that the officer mentioned as good news.
*14:21.040- 14:24.220* :  It has changed a lot since the last time I visited.
*14:24.820- 14:27.920* :  It looked more like a battlefield, not a cemetery.
*14:28.560- 14:32.100* :  Bullet shells and destroyed technicals were all over the place.
*14:33.080- 14:37.340* :  The ongoing civil war in Sudan did not only impact those who are alive
*14:37.920- 14:38.980* :  and trapped in between,
*14:39.020- 14:43.340* :  but reached to the where the deaths are, including my father.
*14:44.200- 14:48.200* :  It was such an emotional moment for me to see my father's grave.
*14:48.200- 14:53.900* :  I felt he was listening to me and knew why I did not visit him for over a year.
*14:54.560- 14:59.460* :  As we were leaving back home, my friend and I had opposite feelings.
*15:00.180- 15:03.340* :  I was happy that I was able to visit my father's grave
*15:04.000- 15:06.260* :  while he was in complete sadness,
*15:07.080- 15:11.520* :  that his father's grave which was at front door no longer there
*15:12.080- 15:13.700* :  to greet him every morning,
*15:14.400- 15:16.760* :  like he did during the past five months.
*15:17.720- 15:22.020* :  I hope the next time the army officer publishes some good news
*15:22.680- 15:25.940* :  be on the end of this bloody war in Sudan.
*15:26.560- 15:28.660* :  Ahmed in Khartoum in Sudan.
*15:29.720- 15:32.700* :  According to the WHO, dementia is the world's
*15:32.900- 15:34.340* :  seventh leading cause of death
*15:35.020- 15:38.720* :  with around 55 million current sufferers around the globe.
*15:39.420- 15:42.220* :  Now scientists have developed a new method of predicting
*15:42.220- 15:45.860* :  dimensionally a decade before it starts to take hold
*15:46.320- 15:50.000* :  with over 80% accuracy, which is better than memory tests
*15:50.520- 15:52.700* :  or measurements of brain shrinkage.
*15:53.340- 15:57.320* :  Professor Charles Marshall led the research at Queen Mary University, London.
*15:58.000- 16:01.660* :  So we know that when people develop problems with their memory and
*16:01.660- 16:04.000* :  go to see their doctor and get a diagnosis of dementia,
*16:04.620- 16:08.300* :  their brain has been changing for 10 to 20 years by that time.
*16:09.240- 16:12.460* :  And at the moment, we tend to rely on either seeing
*16:12.460- 16:15.060* :  that somebody's not doing very well on memory tests
*16:15.380- 16:18.220* :  or showing that their brain has shrunk on a brain scan
*16:18.260- 16:19.560* :  to help us make the diagnosis.
*16:20.600- 16:22.140* :  But before those things are evident,
*16:22.420- 16:25.220* :  the way that the different regions of the brain talk
*16:25.220- 16:28.820* :  to each other starts to be affected by the loss of brain cells
*16:29.440- 16:32.500* :  in dementia. And that's what we were able to show in this study.
*16:32.500- 16:35.680* :  So we looked at functional brain scans.
*16:35.680- 16:37.860* :  So that's when somebody's lying in a brain scanner
*16:38.200- 16:41.220* :  and the MRI scan is able to pick up
*16:41.580- 16:43.620* :  how active different regions of the brain are.
*16:44.120- 16:46.880* :  And we can use that to show how strongly connected
*16:47.260- 16:48.240* :  the brain regions are.
*16:48.700- 16:50.700* :  And we were able to show that the strength of connections
*16:50.780- 16:52.980* :  between brain regions could predict
*16:52.980- 16:55.320* :  who was going to get dementia up to nine years in the future.
*16:55.820- 16:58.160* :  What we would really like to do is to find
*16:58.280- 17:00.220* :  treatments that we can give people
*17:00.220- 17:03.260* :  that can prevent them from losing brain cells
*17:03.480- 17:05.560* :  and prevent them from developing dementia.
*17:05.660- 17:08.020* :  Because once people lose brain cells, we can't replace them.
*17:08.900- 17:10.580* :  And so we would like to be able to treat
*17:10.920- 17:12.240* :  the condition as early as possible,
*17:12.240- 17:14.100* :  ideally even before people get symptoms.
*17:14.220- 17:16.440* :  So what I hope is that this might allow us
*17:16.540- 17:18.760* :  to have a better way of finding people
*17:18.800- 17:20.340* :  who are at risk of developing dementia
*17:20.340- 17:22.280* :  to go into trials of treatments
*17:22.280- 17:24.860* :  so that we can find those things
*17:24.920- 17:26.880* :  that are going to change the situation
*17:27.100- 17:28.600* :  that we have at the moment where there is no
*17:28.940- 17:30.400* :  effective treatment available to people.
*17:30.940- 17:32.400* :  Professor Charles Marshall.
*17:33.280- 17:34.680* :  Three people have been arrested
*17:34.680- 17:36.560* :  at a football match in Hong Kong
*17:37.000- 17:40.020* :  on suspicion of insulting the Chinese national anthem.
*17:40.560- 17:42.540* :  Here's our China media analyst, Kerry Allen.
*17:49.460- 17:51.660* :  What you're hearing is the Chinese national anthem,
*17:51.780- 17:53.640* :  which is called March of the Volunteers.
*17:54.060- 17:56.080* :  It was played last night in the city of Hong Kong
*17:56.220- 17:59.760* :  ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier match
*17:59.760- 18:01.260* :  between Hong Kong and Iran.
*18:02.020- 18:05.020* :  Iran's football team went on to defeat Hong Kong 4-2.
*18:05.580- 18:08.320* :  So there have been a lot of disappointed Hong Kong football fans today.
*18:08.880- 18:10.680* :  But what's really caused us during the city
*18:10.680- 18:13.860* :  is the news that three people were arrested at last night's match
*18:14.400- 18:16.080* :  for not standing for the national anthem.
*18:16.860- 18:19.140* :  Police in Hong Kong have said that two men and a woman
*18:19.540- 18:22.240* :  aged between 18 and 31 were detained
*18:22.240- 18:25.240* :  for allegedly disrespecting the anthem while it was playing
*18:25.240- 18:28.460* :  and turning their backs to the field and not standing during the tune.
*18:29.220- 18:32.000* :  Some media say that playing close police officers were observing
*18:32.000- 18:34.580* :  and filming spectators while the song was being played.
*18:35.460- 18:37.480* :  According to the South China Morning Post newspaper,
*18:37.480- 18:39.240* :  the three have now been released on bail,
*18:39.760- 18:42.160* :  but they're required to report back to the police in early July.
*18:42.800- 18:44.700* :  There's a possibility that they could face a fine
*18:44.700- 18:46.340* :  or even jail time for their actions.
*18:46.960- 18:50.720* :  In 2020, the national anthem ordinance was passed in Hong Kong
*18:51.220- 18:54.120* :  and that criminalises insults to the national anthem of China.
*18:55.060- 18:57.580* :  The law was introduced a year after large-scale protests
*18:57.580- 18:59.580* :  to increase communist powers in the city
*19:00.020- 19:01.120* :  and it came after another song,
*19:01.120- 19:04.120* :  Glory to Hong Kong, was mistakenly played as the city's anthem
*19:04.120- 19:06.140* :  at several international sporting events.
*19:06.800- 19:10.260* :  Some in Hong Kong have subsequently adopted this song as an informal anthem
*19:10.680- 19:12.800* :  and have booed the Chinese national anthem when it's played.
*19:13.660- 19:15.420* :  Doing so now can carry a heavy penalty.
*19:16.040- 19:18.800* :  The maximum sentence for intentionally insulting the anthem
*19:19.140- 19:20.440* :  under the national anthem ordinance
*19:20.440- 19:24.180* :  is three years in prison and a $6,300 fine.
*19:24.880- 19:26.900* :  Carrie Allen, our China media analyst,
*19:27.040- 19:29.180* :  and we've had a statement from Amnesty International
*19:29.180- 19:31.140* :  which says once again in Hong Kong,
*19:31.140- 19:35.040* :  a thoroughly peaceful act of protest is met with a heavy-handed police response
*19:35.060- 19:39.620* :  via a repressive law designed to muzzle freedom of expression.
*19:42.480- 19:44.700* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*19:45.560- 19:48.180* :  Pump back whales need to bulk up on all this energy
*19:48.520- 19:51.020* :  to make their epic migrations across oceans
*19:51.100- 19:54.520* :  it's something we take for granted but it's incredibly fragile.
*19:55.180- 19:58.860* :  The impact of climate change on humpback whales in the Antarctic.
*20:08.820- 20:11.340* :  This podcast is brought to you by eHarmony.
*20:11.660- 20:14.180* :  The dating app to find someone you can be yourself with.
*20:14.800- 20:17.780* :  Why doesn't eHarmony allow copy and paste in first messages?
*20:18.360- 20:21.560* :  Because you are unique and your conversations should reflect that.
*20:22.220- 20:24.880* :  eHarmony wants you to find someone who will get you.
*20:25.220- 20:26.820* :  How are you going to know who gets you?
*20:27.060- 20:29.420* :  If people sing you the same generic conversation starters,
*20:29.660- 20:30.980* :  they message everyone else.
*20:31.360- 20:33.980* :  Conversations that actually help you get to know each other.
*20:34.240- 20:34.920* :  Imagine that.
*20:35.460- 20:37.100* :  Get who gets you on eHarmony.
*20:37.400- 20:38.020* :  Sign up today.
*20:38.560- 20:39.280* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*20:39.480- 20:41.740* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team
*20:41.740- 20:45.340* :  if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*20:45.760- 20:46.380* :  They said yes.
*20:46.800- 20:48.500* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically
*20:48.500- 20:50.760* :  violates those honorists to your contracts,
*20:50.760- 20:53.140* :  they said what the **** are you talking about?
*20:53.140- 20:54.560* :  You insane Hollywood ****.
*20:54.560- 20:57.440* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*20:57.440- 21:00.320* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*21:00.480- 21:02.960* :  Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*21:12.800- 21:16.500* :  Samsung electronics avoided the unionization of its employees.
*21:16.500- 21:18.060* :  For almost half a century.
*21:18.620- 21:20.980* :  In fact, the founder said he wouldn't allow unions
*21:20.980- 21:23.680* :  until he had dirt over his eyes.
*21:24.420- 21:25.880* :  He died in 1987.
*21:26.340- 21:27.760* :  But it wasn't until this decade
*21:27.760- 21:30.000* :  that the firm allowed union representation.
*21:30.700- 21:33.640* :  Now union members are taking part in the first ever strike
*21:33.640- 21:36.740* :  at the South Korean firm over demands for better pay.
*21:37.320- 21:40.480* :  Son Woo Mark is head of the National Samsung Electronics Union.
*21:41.340- 21:49.280* :  Although Samsung Electronics has yet to listen to us,
*21:49.640- 21:51.340* :  we see the strike as just the beginning.
*21:52.140- 21:54.940* :  We plan to get to the end and fight to the end
*21:55.340- 21:56.820* :  with all the employees' support.
*21:57.760- 22:01.240* :  If the company continues to deal with the issue without compromise,
*22:01.940- 22:04.260* :  we will continue to voice our concerns.
*22:05.260- 22:07.820* :  I heard more about the industrial action in South Korea
*22:07.820- 22:09.640* :  from our business reporter Nick Marsh.
*22:10.380- 22:14.340* :  It's not unusual for industrial disputes to happen in Korea.
*22:14.340- 22:17.440* :  We've seen disputes at Hyundai and the doctors strike obviously
*22:17.440- 22:19.000* :  that we've been talking about so much.
*22:19.620- 22:21.480* :  But for Samsung Electronics,
*22:22.020- 22:23.760* :  this is actually pretty unusual.
*22:23.780- 22:26.120* :  It's the crown jewel of the wider Samsung group.
*22:26.700- 22:29.840* :  It's the heartbeat of South Korea's business landscape
*22:29.900- 22:31.580* :  of its whole economy, some would argue.
*22:32.240- 22:34.380* :  And for most of Samsung's history,
*22:34.380- 22:38.260* :  they have not allowed union representation in South Korea.
*22:38.700- 22:41.620* :  They only allowed it in 2020 for the first time.
*22:42.260- 22:45.000* :  And now, we're seeing this dispute over pay,
*22:45.000- 22:48.440* :  over bonuses, which haven't been paid out recently,
*22:48.440- 22:49.600* :  which they've come to expect.
*22:50.600- 22:53.960* :  The union leaders also want an extra day of paid leave.
*22:54.540- 22:56.920* :  They haven't been able to come to any kind of agreement
*22:56.920- 22:58.360* :  with the bosses at Samsung.
*22:58.920- 23:01.420* :  So now the union has told its workers
*23:01.960- 23:05.560* :  to take the day off today in the form of paid leave.
*23:05.580- 23:07.040* :  So it's not quite as strike in the way
*23:07.460- 23:09.820* :  most people would conventionally define it,
*23:09.880- 23:12.820* :  but it is an act of protest, basically.
*23:13.120- 23:16.940* :  Yeah, and nor do they think it will affect production,
*23:16.980- 23:20.860* :  but I guess it's a shot across the boughs of management there.
*23:21.080- 23:22.100* :  It is, yeah, exactly.
*23:22.100- 23:24.060* :  It's the first time Samsung employees
*23:24.420- 23:26.780* :  have ever taken this kind of action.
*23:27.640- 23:29.440* :  We don't really know how many people
*23:29.440- 23:32.260* :  have heated this call from the union leaders.
*23:32.400- 23:34.500* :  The union's actually being quite tight lipped on numbers.
*23:34.960- 23:36.900* :  They've had a little protest outside the headquarters.
*23:36.900- 23:37.840* :  There's nothing huge.
*23:38.360- 23:40.900* :  Samsung electronics and all their media statements
*23:41.620- 23:45.460* :  are suggesting that nowhere near the 28,000 members
*23:46.060- 23:49.660* :  represented by this main union actually stayed at home.
*23:50.120- 23:52.380* :  And in terms of yet the material impact like you say,
*23:52.380- 23:55.340* :  Ali, I mean, it's not really going to affect the production
*23:55.520- 23:58.980* :  of memory chips, the advanced memory chips that Samsung
*23:58.980- 24:01.020* :  is a massive producer of.
*24:01.420- 24:03.580* :  The actual facilities haven't been affected.
*24:03.580- 24:05.140* :  This mainly like a white collar strike
*24:05.600- 24:06.540* :  that we're talking about.
*24:07.000- 24:08.360* :  But as we heard from the union leaders,
*24:08.800- 24:10.320* :  this is just the start.
*24:10.320- 24:13.220* :  It hasn't been resolved yet, and it could escalate further.
*24:13.780- 24:15.520* :  All right, as your business reporter, Nick Marsh,
*24:16.440- 24:18.900* :  baby reindeer is the Netflix TV series
*24:18.900- 24:21.860* :  about a stalker which captivated millions of viewers.
*24:22.820- 24:23.360* :  Who was it?
*24:25.200- 24:26.740* :  Martha, can you let go of my hand now, please?
*24:27.160- 24:27.720* :  I want nim.
*24:27.900- 24:28.620* :  Martha, please.
*24:28.960- 24:29.360* :  Nim.
*24:29.940- 24:30.580* :  Martha, please.
*24:30.720- 24:30.940* :  Nim.
*24:31.160- 24:32.520* :  Martha, please let go of it.
*24:34.660- 24:36.500* :  Well, what made the series so compelling
*24:36.500- 24:39.200* :  was that it was billed as a true story.
*24:39.660- 24:42.620* :  But now the woman claiming to have inspired the drama,
*24:42.620- 24:45.720* :  Fiona Harvey, is suing Netflix in the US
*24:45.720- 24:49.140* :  for more than $170 million for defamation
*24:49.140- 24:52.460* :  and quote the intentional inflection of emotional distress
*24:53.160- 24:55.760* :  with the details our culture and media editor Katie Razzle.
*24:56.380- 24:59.400* :  When it came out and became this, I mean, I would say sleeper hit.
*24:59.400- 25:03.160* :  I don't think even Netflix was expecting it to go be this popular.
*25:03.600- 25:05.460* :  Internet sleuths pretty quickly went on the hunt
*25:05.460- 25:08.120* :  for the person Martha's allegedly based on
*25:08.560- 25:10.500* :  named a Scottish woman called Fiona Harvey.
*25:10.960- 25:14.120* :  She then did an interview saying it was completely untrue.
*25:14.120- 25:16.520* :  Her life had been made a measure as a result of the program.
*25:16.700- 25:19.420* :  I mean, it is worth saying that shows end credits do say
*25:19.420- 25:20.900* :  the program's based on real events.
*25:20.900- 25:23.540* :  However, certain characters, names, incidents, locations
*25:24.040- 25:26.080* :  and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.
*25:26.660- 25:29.940* :  So she's served this court document in California
*25:29.940- 25:31.220* :  where Netflix is based.
*25:31.740- 25:33.600* :  She's basically suing the stream
*25:33.600- 25:37.020* :  for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.
*25:37.740- 25:39.440* :  You know, either it's going to be tested in court.
*25:39.440- 25:40.420* :  There might be a settlement.
*25:40.420- 25:43.760* :  We don't know for sure what her chances are.
*25:43.760- 25:45.460* :  This document they filed in California,
*25:45.740- 25:47.160* :  it isn't given to understatement.
*25:47.160- 25:49.000* :  It's got that sort of American hyperbole.
*25:49.000- 25:50.520* :  It's more than a sniff of that about it.
*25:50.800- 25:52.040* :  It calls the drama.
*25:52.040- 25:54.060* :  This is the biggest lie in television history
*25:54.060- 25:55.880* :  about the fact that it says it's a true story
*25:56.340- 25:58.560* :  and it says that she's an innocent woman
*25:58.560- 26:00.980* :  defamed by Netflix and Richard Gad
*26:00.980- 26:03.740* :  at a magnitude and scale without precedent.
*26:04.460- 26:06.720* :  We have her from Netflix, which says it intends
*26:06.720- 26:08.300* :  to defend this matter vigorously
*26:08.300- 26:11.400* :  and to stand by Richard Gad's right to tell his story.
*26:11.400- 26:12.840* :  But clearly, the key questions are,
*26:13.160- 26:14.200* :  you know, has she been defamed?
*26:14.480- 26:15.880* :  Has she had a privacy invaded?
*26:16.240- 26:18.000* :  Has Netflix behaved negligently?
*26:18.500- 26:20.540* :  And you know, part of her case is around the fact
*26:20.540- 26:23.440* :  that very quickly these internet sleuths were able to find her.
*26:23.440- 26:25.240* :  She's a Scottish lawyer, the woman portrayed
*26:25.740- 26:27.060* :  in the dramas of Scottish lawyer,
*26:27.060- 26:28.640* :  the similar age looks similar.
*26:28.640- 26:30.740* :  You know, there are lots of ways that she was
*26:30.740- 26:32.700* :  immediately able to be identified.
*26:33.240- 26:35.660* :  Our culture and media editor, Katie Razzle.
*26:36.260- 26:38.920* :  Trademark cases have been in the news lately.
*26:38.920- 26:42.620* :  The New York Times recently took on World Hall,
*26:43.080- 26:44.580* :  a browser-based geography game,
*26:44.580- 26:47.140* :  which it says is too similar to its own,
*26:47.460- 26:47.920* :  World Hall.
*26:48.480- 26:50.600* :  Now, the EU's highest court has ruled
*26:50.600- 26:53.380* :  that McDonald's no longer has the exclusive right
*26:53.380- 26:56.500* :  to market chicken burgers under the Big Mac brand.
*26:57.080- 26:59.160* :  After an Irish fast food chain,
*26:59.160- 27:00.820* :  Supermax took them to court.
*27:01.540- 27:03.660* :  Catherine Sans is a legal correspondent
*27:03.660- 27:05.580* :  for the business post in Dublin.
*27:06.340- 27:08.620* :  So Supermax is an Irish fast food chain.
*27:08.720- 27:11.380* :  It opened in the late 1970s.
*27:11.520- 27:13.660* :  It's expanded widely across the country.
*27:13.660- 27:16.820* :  Currently has over 100 outlets around Ireland.
*27:17.420- 27:18.940* :  Similar to McDonald's, it sells burgers,
*27:18.940- 27:21.700* :  cheeseburgers, chicken burgers, fries, milkshakes.
*27:22.220- 27:26.400* :  Pat McDonough is the founder behind the Supermax chain.
*27:26.400- 27:28.580* :  He is a gallway-based businessman,
*27:29.300- 27:30.740* :  quite a well-known figure in Ireland.
*27:31.340- 27:33.480* :  The fight with McDonald's happened
*27:33.780- 27:37.660* :  because of the trademark over the phrase Big Mac.
*27:38.420- 27:40.840* :  So Supermax have historically said
*27:40.840- 27:43.360* :  that McDonald's have used the Big Mac trademark
*27:43.360- 27:46.080* :  to prevent them from expanding outside of Ireland.
*27:46.080- 27:49.100* :  Supermax filed an application to get McDonald's
*27:49.560- 27:51.920* :  trademark under Big Mac revoked.
*27:52.260- 27:54.740* :  They said that they hadn't been genuinely using it.
*27:55.220- 27:57.780* :  And the latest ruling from the European court
*27:58.140- 27:58.860* :  agreed partially.
*27:58.860- 28:01.880* :  It said that McDonald's could not use the trademark
*28:01.880- 28:03.740* :  when it came to poultry products
*28:04.160- 28:05.580* :  such as chicken sandwiches.
*28:06.120- 28:08.120* :  The ruling will also prevent McDonald's
*28:08.280- 28:11.360* :  from using the Big Mac term as a protected trademark
*28:11.360- 28:14.500* :  when branding a restaurant or a drive-through facility.
*28:14.900- 28:16.840* :  So kind of an interesting detailed row
*28:16.840- 28:19.380* :  about a Big Mac and a chicken sandwich.
*28:19.960- 28:22.460* :  Catherine Sans of the Business Post in Dublin.
*28:23.460- 28:26.600* :  Scientists studying humpback whales in the Antarctic
*28:26.980- 28:29.120* :  say they believe climate change could threaten
*28:29.120- 28:30.580* :  the mammal's food supply.
*28:30.580- 28:33.400* :  The region's fragile environment has been changed
*28:33.400- 28:35.500* :  by the rate that the sea ice is melting.
*28:35.880- 28:37.560* :  Our correspondent Victoria Gill
*28:37.560- 28:39.420* :  went to sea with the research team.
*28:41.320- 28:44.140* :  I know we have 50 to 60 not wins.
*28:44.820- 28:47.420* :  I've just woken up and the ship is moving quite a lot.
*28:47.980- 28:49.520* :  We're halfway through a two-day crossing
*28:49.520- 28:51.800* :  on the notoriously rough southern ocean.
*28:52.100- 28:53.620* :  So right now we're making good speeds.
*28:53.620- 28:56.400* :  There's still 10 knots towards the Antarctic peninsula.
*28:56.800- 28:59.080* :  Also on this 200 passenger tourist ship
*28:59.080- 29:01.360* :  are scientists who plan to carry out health checks
*29:01.500- 29:02.960* :  on Antarctic humpback whales.
*29:04.540- 29:07.360* :  This is my first time using a tourist boat or cruise ship
*29:07.380- 29:08.740* :  for doing research.
*29:09.200- 29:11.680* :  Dr. Sarah Keeneley from Baylor University in Texas
*29:11.960- 29:14.340* :  says working with tourism helps reduce the cost
*29:14.420- 29:15.900* :  and impact of a research trip
*29:15.900- 29:17.800* :  to one of the most remote places on Earth.
*29:18.100- 29:19.500* :  The science and the tourists want to go to
*29:19.500- 29:21.760* :  the hot spots of Baylor University of animals.
*29:21.760- 29:23.640* :  And so we're going to the same places
*29:23.640- 29:25.180* :  and get to do science at the same time.
*29:26.480- 29:29.300* :  In the mercifully calm Antarctic coastal waters
*29:29.540- 29:31.840* :  the team sets out early on a small inflatable boat.
*29:31.920- 29:33.140* :  Yeah, let's go find something.
*29:33.240- 29:35.840* :  Chris Johnson is from the Wildlife Charity WWF.
*29:36.100- 29:39.160* :  The superpower of the Antarctic is Antarctic krill.
*29:39.320- 29:42.260* :  You know, this tiny crustacean fuels
*29:42.480- 29:44.920* :  this incredible wildlife that we see.
*29:45.160- 29:46.940* :  Climate change is impacting krill.
*29:47.660- 29:48.660* :  That's what we're concerned about
*29:48.660- 29:50.400* :  is climate change impacts on prey.
*29:50.740- 29:51.520* :  And that's a big deal.
*29:52.480- 29:55.140* :  Pumpback whales need to bulk up on all this energy
*29:55.480- 29:58.000* :  to make their epic migrations across oceans.
*29:58.440- 29:59.560* :  It's something we take for granted,
*30:00.000- 30:01.480* :  but it's incredibly fragile.
*30:02.940- 30:05.480* :  We're trying to get a whole picture of their health.
*30:06.220- 30:06.860* :  They're close.
*30:07.820- 30:10.660* :  When we spot a whale biologist Natalia Batero Acosta
*30:10.660- 30:12.800* :  reaches for her custom-made crossbow.
*30:13.540- 30:14.520* :  It looks like a weapon.
*30:14.700- 30:16.260* :  Is that a weapon by any means?
*30:16.320- 30:17.260* :  It's a scientific tool.
*30:17.760- 30:20.200* :  We use them to collect lover and skin samples.
*30:21.320- 30:22.620* :  Move alongside a humpback.
*30:23.980- 30:25.360* :  The whale's just a few meters away
*30:25.360- 30:27.320* :  and three times the length of our rubber boat.
*30:27.880- 30:30.520* :  It arches its back above the water and Natalia aims.
*30:32.100- 30:35.220* :  Each tiny nugget of tissue contains chemical clues,
*30:35.220- 30:37.600* :  hormones that build up in whale's blubber
*30:37.660- 30:39.200* :  and show if it's stressed, hungry,
*30:39.500- 30:40.560* :  or if a female is pregnant.
*30:41.080- 30:43.880* :  In years that we have low sea eyes,
*30:44.340- 30:46.900* :  then the following year you have lower pregnancy rates.
*30:47.480- 30:49.680* :  And that's as good as it gets in like, you know,
*30:49.900- 30:51.100* :  getting to know the environment
*30:51.160- 30:52.320* :  and getting to know the effects
*30:52.320- 30:54.980* :  of all these conservation threats on the animals.
*30:57.800- 31:00.180* :  Another way to study these animals is from the air.
*31:00.740- 31:01.460* :  So you got the drone out.
*31:01.460- 31:02.340* :  What can you see?
*31:02.780- 31:04.100* :  I can see a bubble in that feeding.
*31:04.300- 31:06.100* :  So we've got five humpback whales
*31:06.300- 31:09.780* :  blowing bubbles together in a cooperative way.
*31:10.000- 31:11.060* :  There's a circle of bubbles
*31:12.080- 31:13.180* :  and then they just move inside
*31:13.180- 31:14.020* :  to dive at the crop.
*31:14.120- 31:14.880* :  That's incredible.
*31:15.000- 31:16.840* :  And then they come up and they scoop them up.
*31:18.240- 31:19.520* :  Look at the giant now.
*31:19.520- 31:21.360* :  It's the most epic things to see.
*31:23.940- 31:26.280* :  Chris is also using the drone to weigh the whales.
*31:26.760- 31:30.480* :  From the drone, we're measuring how fat it's becoming over the season.
*31:30.640- 31:31.400* :  And that's really important
*31:31.400- 31:33.140* :  because some populations around the world
*31:33.800- 31:34.440* :  are getting skinny
*31:35.060- 31:36.400* :  because they're not getting enough to eat
*31:36.580- 31:37.720* :  because of climate change.
*31:38.960- 31:40.460* :  The scientists are building up clues
*31:40.740- 31:42.080* :  that are hidden in the whale's bodies
*31:42.120- 31:44.020* :  about how this environment is changing.
*31:44.640- 31:47.240* :  Coming here each year, we discover something new.
*31:47.700- 31:49.020* :  This is helping us to find
*31:49.420- 31:50.640* :  one of the most critical habitats
*31:51.240- 31:53.020* :  and protect this area for
*31:53.480- 31:55.440* :  Antarctic krill, for humpbacks, for penguins.
*31:55.700- 31:57.360* :  You know, this place is not only important for nature
*31:57.580- 31:58.720* :  but it's also important to us.
*32:00.980- 32:03.560* :  Chris Johnson ending that report by Victoria Gill.
*32:06.580- 32:07.860* :  And that is all from us for now,
*32:07.860- 32:10.540* :  but the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
*32:10.540- 32:13.520* :  This edition was mixed by Masoud Ibrahim Khale
*32:13.860- 32:17.120* :  and produced by Richard Hamilton, our editors, Karen Martin.
*32:17.660- 32:18.460* :  I'm Oliver Conway.
