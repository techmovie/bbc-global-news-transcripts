*00:21.580- 00:23.920* :  prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:24.340- 00:26.940* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:26.940- 00:30.700* :  honorists to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:28.960- 01:33.980* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh, and in the early hours of Monday, July 1st, these are our main stories.
*01:33.980- 01:39.200* :  The French elections exit poll show that the national rally of Marine Le Pen
*01:39.200- 01:42.520* :  has won the biggest share of ballots in the first round of voting.
*01:44.900- 01:49.400* :  Democracy is spoken, and the French voters have clearly expressed their wish to start a
*01:49.400- 01:52.680* :  fresh after 70 years of contemptuous and corrosive power.
*01:52.960- 01:58.060* :  12 out of 32 ministries in South Africa's new cabinet go to the opposition
*01:58.540- 02:03.220* :  in the first government to include non-A&C ministers since the advent of democracy.
*02:04.180- 02:09.100* :  And the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines tells us about the approach of hurricane
*02:09.100- 02:18.060* :  barrel. Also in this podcast, the UN holds talks with the Afghan Taliban government in Qatar,
*02:18.760- 02:22.060* :  is bringing them to the table, giving them implicit recognition.
*02:23.100- 02:27.180* :  Australia introduces some of the world's toughest new regulations on vaping.
*02:27.980- 02:29.820* :  And Islam meets heavy metal.
*02:35.300- 02:38.880* :  The Indonesian hijab wearing women who played class and brie.
*02:43.880- 02:47.980* :  It seems that the French president Emmanuel Macron's gamble has spectacularly
*02:47.980- 02:53.320* :  backfired. In the first round of his snap parliamentary election, his rival, the far-right
*02:53.320- 02:58.820* :  national rally party, is projected to have come out on top with exit polls predicting that it
*02:58.820- 03:05.580* :  took 34 percent of the vote in the first round. A left-wing coalition came second on 28 percent
*03:05.580- 03:11.120* :  with Mr. Macron's centrist alliance trailing well behind on 22 percent.
*03:11.860- 03:17.240* :  Marine Le Pen is the national rally's leading figure and she's been celebrating her party's success.
*03:19.400- 03:24.820* :  My dear compatriots, democracy has spoken and the French people have placed the national rally
*03:24.820- 03:31.000* :  and it allies on top and have practically erased President Macron's blog. To begin this change
*03:31.020- 03:36.000* :  in government and drive the reforms that the country needs, we need an absolute majority.
*03:36.000- 03:41.600* :  In order for Jordan Badella to be named in eight days, Prime Minister, by Emmanuel Macron.
*03:42.940- 03:47.840* :  Leaders of the left and centre are now calling for voters to unite against Marine Le Pen
*03:47.840- 03:53.300* :  in the second round next Sunday. Among them, France's Prime Minister, Gabrielle Atal,
*03:53.300- 03:56.400* :  who said the national rally were at the gates of power.
*03:59.200- 04:05.680* :  I say this with the force that the moment demands to each and every one of our voters,
*04:06.560- 04:11.040* :  not a single vote must go to the national rally.
*04:11.760- 04:17.040* :  With just one week to go until the crucial second round, is the national rally's victory a
*04:17.040- 04:21.680* :  foregone conclusion? A question for our Paris correspondent, Hussko Field.
*04:22.120- 04:24.920* :  Well, I mean, not quite yet. There is another round of voting, as she well knows.
*04:25.200- 04:29.660* :  So I've gone home without any sort of overt rejoicing because they have to get back
*04:29.660- 04:35.160* :  campaigning. There's a theoretical possibility that the Macron party and the left can come together
*04:35.520- 04:41.140* :  by voting tactically and making arrangements to really keep down the number of MPs are
*04:41.140- 04:45.960* :  voted for the far right. But all that said, quite clearly, the victory is hers in this first round.
*04:45.960- 04:50.900* :  And if the momentum is maintained and so far, the momentum through the European election,
*04:50.900- 04:55.780* :  to this election has been just simply upwards for the RN. If that momentum is maintained,
*04:55.880- 05:00.800* :  then next Sunday we'll see her really being able to cry victor because they will have won this
*05:00.860- 05:04.900* :  still in a election. The only question that really remains to be how big her victory is going
*05:04.900- 05:11.500* :  to be and will the party have this outright majority in Parliament or will it be foreshorted
*05:11.500- 05:15.740* :  about the key number of 289? And there's a big difference between the two because if she can't
*05:15.740- 05:20.500* :  get that number, she can't really govern because no one's going to join an alliance with her.
*05:20.580- 05:24.540* :  And what do you make of the Prime Minister's stance this evening in the wake of these polls?
*05:24.740- 05:28.400* :  Poverty else, he's simply sort of mouthing what President Macron said earlier on, which is
*05:28.820- 05:33.960* :  everything should be done to keep out the national rally. Now, there is nuance here because
*05:33.960- 05:39.180* :  earlier on in this campaign, Macron very publicly said that the battle was one of the centre,
*05:39.180- 05:45.700* :  i.e. him, against the extremes, the right and the left. Right now, he seems to have come back
*05:45.700- 05:51.500* :  to a more conventional position saying, you know, left and centre, good, far-right, bad. So left and
*05:51.500- 05:55.960* :  centre come together to keep out the hard right. If the national rally does get into government,
*05:55.960- 06:01.080* :  what will be the impact on French politics? Well, in almost, simply enormous. A lot will depend,
*06:01.080- 06:04.840* :  of course, on this question whether it gets that right, majority or not, but I mean, it will
*06:04.840- 06:09.120* :  be an earthquake here and in Europe. The French allies will be extremely troubled by the
*06:09.120- 06:13.420* :  meaning of all this. I think what we can expect in the media term is, you know, a lot of
*06:13.420- 06:17.100* :  pronouncements from the national rally to the fact that they're not going to do anything dramatic.
*06:17.360- 06:22.140* :  But nonetheless, you know, they are a party with the roots in the anti-sentimentic past of the
*06:22.140- 06:26.340* :  far-right in France. It's going to be quite a bumpy ride. And above all, because we'll have
*06:26.340- 06:30.980* :  this situation where we have a president of one party that's Macron and the Prime Minister and
*06:30.980- 06:37.280* :  the other party swore an enemy, they'll be at a dagger's drawn. But it'll be Macron who loses
*06:38.020- 06:42.680* :  power will move from the Elise towards Hotel Matino, that is, the residents of the Prime
*06:42.680- 06:48.040* :  Minister. It'll be the Prime Minister who calls the shots. Huse Gofield, the vote was a resounding
*06:48.040- 06:53.940* :  personal success for Miss Le Pen, who was elected on first-round votes alone. Our correspondent
*06:53.940- 07:00.400* :  Rob Young is in her constituency, Enin Bommel. He says there was already a party atmosphere there
*07:00.400- 07:06.600* :  as her result came in. In the moments before the first projections of the results were announced,
*07:06.600- 07:12.600* :  the champagne was already flowing at this national rally party here. Hundreds of people had
*07:12.600- 07:17.140* :  champagne flutes in their hands. They were already very much enjoying themselves. And when
*07:17.140- 07:22.640* :  the projections were put on the giant screens here from one of the main French television channels,
*07:22.640- 07:28.340* :  the place just erupted into cheering. People were jumping in the air. They were hugging each other.
*07:28.500- 07:33.980* :  It really was a party atmosphere here. And then Marine Le Pen came onto the stage here. She
*07:33.980- 07:40.120* :  addressed the adoring crowd. She said that she had won her constituency. In the first round,
*07:40.260- 07:45.720* :  it's been reported she's got 58% of the vote in the first round. That is the first time she's not
*07:45.720- 07:52.920* :  had to go into a runoff, if confirmed. What we heard from Marine Le Pen and her speech to supporters,
*07:52.920- 07:58.760* :  but she was very much aware, because of the dozens of TV cameras at the back of the hall here,
*07:58.760- 08:04.340* :  that this was being watched by people far beyond this community centre in this small town,
*08:04.340- 08:10.200* :  in North East France. She was trying to reach out, I think, beyond the hardcore supporters and
*08:10.200- 08:14.880* :  those who have perhaps been flirting with the national rally in this election because of their
*08:14.880- 08:20.980* :  frustration with the state of public services or the squeeze on their living standards. And she said,
*08:20.980- 08:26.440* :  we need an absolute majority. They are very much trying to say people do not need to be scared of
*08:26.620- 08:30.900* :  this party. They're saying that it has changed. The problem when you go out and speak to people
*08:30.900- 08:38.400* :  even in this very town that Marine Le Pen represents, there is concern. There is a fear among some
*08:38.400- 08:44.340* :  people that the national rally may have changed their policies. They may talk in a different way,
*08:44.960- 08:50.500* :  but their concern is that the party hasn't really reformed. And that is why it's going to be
*08:50.500- 08:55.680* :  a struggle perhaps for the national rally to persuade sufficient number of French people to give
*08:55.680- 09:02.420* :  them, maybe lend them their vote in a week's time. Rob Young. A month after the ANC lost its
*09:02.420- 09:08.720* :  majority in elections in South Africa, President Cyril Ramaposa has announced a new coalition cabinet.
*09:09.340- 09:15.180* :  For the first time since the end of a party 30 years ago, the African National Congress will have
*09:15.180- 09:22.040* :  to share power. After weeks of tense negotiations, the main opposition party, the democratic alliance,
*09:22.040- 09:28.560* :  will hold six posts. Our correspondent in Johannesburg, Shingai Nyoka, has this assessment of
*09:28.560- 09:34.780* :  the new government. Essentially this was a juggling act for President Cyril Ramaposa, and he alluded
*09:34.780- 09:42.640* :  to that in his speech that a government of national unity of this size was unprecedented in South
*09:42.640- 09:50.020* :  Africa's history. He had to accommodate the interests of 11 political parties. So really in his
*09:50.160- 09:55.240* :  announcement, I think a lot of people were looking to see just how diverse that cabinet and
*09:55.240- 10:01.360* :  national executive would be. What he has done is essentially retain all the key ministries
*10:01.880- 10:07.740* :  under the ANC's control. So international relations where they have that very important policy
*10:07.740- 10:13.700* :  of supporting the Palestinian cause, whereas other political parties within that government
*10:13.700- 10:20.520* :  of national unity were opposed to that. He has also retained the ministerial posts of trade
*10:20.540- 10:27.420* :  and mines as well as land reform in which they contain very controversial policies of black
*10:27.420- 10:36.220* :  economic empowerment. What he has done is give specific portfolios to the main coalition alliance,
*10:36.220- 10:43.960* :  the democratic alliance, giving them the agricultural position which went to the DA leader John
*10:43.960- 10:50.600* :  Stainhason as well as home affairs where there's an illegal immigration crisis that the opposition
*10:50.600- 10:58.320* :  party will have to deal with. But I think a lot of analysts are saying it was a juggling act that
*10:58.320- 11:06.180* :  he managed to handle quite smoothly. A juggling act, but will it be a challenging time to keep
*11:06.220- 11:11.100* :  all these people working together effectively in government? I think that has been the concern
*11:11.380- 11:18.000* :  and that was foreshadowed by all of the tense negotiations that led up to this particular
*11:18.000- 11:24.060* :  announcement. This cabinet was supposed to have been announced last week, but it took weeks and
*11:24.060- 11:30.160* :  weeks of negotiations and at some point last week there was an understanding that it could actually
*11:31.100- 11:35.840* :  collapse because the parties were haggling over positions. And I think the fact that they've
*11:36.220- 11:41.800* :  come up with this particular cabinet. A lot of people see that as a result of Cyril Ramaphosa's
*11:42.220- 11:48.880* :  negotiating skills, many people remember that he was a key negotiator to the end of a partite.
*11:49.240- 11:55.060* :  And so I think there's a lot of optimism about him being able to control all of the parties
*11:55.580- 12:00.640* :  and he alluded to that in his speech trying to reassure South Africans saying that this partnership
*12:00.640- 12:06.800* :  will be guided by a statement of intent which outlines fundamental principles and minimum
*12:06.800- 12:12.480* :  programs of priorities. So in essence what he's saying is that they've already agreed about how
*12:12.480- 12:17.500* :  they're going to work together. But this is a disparate group of political parties,
*12:18.020- 12:24.000* :  11 of them, many of them have diametrically opposed policies and so it'll be interesting to see
*12:24.000- 12:29.760* :  how this new political creature will work together going forward. Shingai Nyoka.
*12:30.640- 12:36.380* :  Taliban officials from Afghanistan have been attending UN-led talks in Qatar for the first time,
*12:36.960- 12:42.260* :  but their insistence women have been banned from the gathering. The United Nations says the
*12:42.260- 12:47.360* :  meetings are an opportunity to interact with the Taliban on vital issues and are not
*12:47.360- 12:53.300* :  tantamount to a recognition of their administration. The agenda includes restrictions imposed on
*12:53.300- 12:57.160* :  Afghanistan's banking system, as well as tackling the narcotics trade.
*12:58.060- 13:04.140* :  Fawziya Kufi is a former Afghan MP. She says the UN has set a dangerous precedent
*13:04.140- 13:10.200* :  by not including women in the talks. If the UN, an organisation which is mandated to protect
*13:10.200- 13:16.820* :  human rights based on its charter, they need to ensure 50% of women inclusion in all the processes.
*13:17.180- 13:22.040* :  And that is the whole, if the same organisation is doing contradiction to their values,
*13:22.040- 13:28.040* :  then who should be good for protection of our rights? Our correspondent Caroline Davis is in Doha.
*13:28.500- 13:33.740* :  This is obviously slightly controversial because of the agreement that the UN came to
*13:34.160- 13:38.780* :  in order to be able to get the Taliban around that table. They had discussions that were scheduled
*13:38.780- 13:44.900* :  and happened in February this year. At that stage, the Taliban did not turn up partly because they
*13:44.900- 13:48.840* :  said they didn't want to be sitting around the table with people from civil society. They wanted
*13:48.840- 13:54.940* :  to be the only ones at the table recognised as the authority in Afghanistan. Now, this time
*13:54.940- 14:01.300* :  round, there are no people from civil society at that talks with the Taliban there. That means that
*14:01.300- 14:07.680* :  there will be no women from Afghanistan representing Afghanistan at those talks. And that's been
*14:07.680- 14:12.920* :  something that has really spurred a large amount of anger and criticism from human rights groups,
*14:12.920- 14:18.360* :  from civil society activists as well. Some of them who've saying that the UN has ultimately
*14:18.360- 14:25.040* :  caved to the Taliban and the Taliban's requirements and are worried about this setting a dangerous
*14:25.040- 14:30.440* :  precedent. Now, the UN have tried to improve the situation by saying things like they are planning
*14:30.440- 14:37.920* :  to have a civil society's meeting happening once the Taliban have left town on Tuesday. However,
*14:37.920- 14:43.000* :  we know that quite a few people that have been invited to those talks from civil society have
*14:43.000- 14:47.940* :  said that they are boycotting that event because of the fact that the UN are meeting with the Taliban without
*14:47.940- 14:52.980* :  having civil society around the table. The UN's argument would probably be, not that they are
*14:52.980- 14:58.700* :  speaking on record about it, that they simply wanted to get the Taliban at the table to have some
*14:58.700- 15:04.900* :  form of meaningful discussion. Now, this meaningful discussion is going to include economic issues,
*15:04.940- 15:11.400* :  issues around current and narcotics. Would we be expecting the plight of women within Afghanistan to
*15:11.400- 15:15.840* :  nonetheless be discussed despite the absence of women? So, that is the other thing that has caused
*15:15.840- 15:19.540* :  some form of consternation and that is the fact that on the official agenda, those are the two
*15:19.540- 15:27.560* :  topics, counter narcotics and economic sort of private sector discussions. Now, officially, human rights
*15:27.560- 15:32.580* :  is not something that's on the agenda. However, talking to delegates here, it's clear that there
*15:32.580- 15:37.380* :  are certain countries that have said that they are going to emphasise this while they have those
*15:37.380- 15:41.320* :  other discussions. So, for example, when they're talking about the private sector, they will bring
*15:41.320- 15:45.440* :  up the role of women in society and they have said that they will make it clear their
*15:45.440- 15:51.000* :  stances on things like human rights and women's rights and women's roles in society and education,
*15:51.160- 15:55.880* :  various of things that they have been completely excluded from since the Taliban have come
*15:56.400- 16:00.040* :  into power, but it's difficult to know because all of this is going to be happening behind closed
*16:00.040- 16:07.400* :  doors. The BBC's Caroline Davis in Doha. For the last 15 years, Nigerians living in the
*16:07.400- 16:12.780* :  northeast of the country have suffered at the hands of a ruthless insurgency by the Islamist
*16:12.780- 16:19.380* :  militant group Boko Haram. On Saturday, at least 18 people were killed and more than 30 injured
*16:19.380- 16:24.660* :  in three bomb blasts at a wedding, a hospital and a funeral. Richard Hamilton reports.
*16:25.320- 16:31.160* :  Although Boko Haram has not admitted carrying out these attacks, they bear all the hallmarks
*16:31.160- 16:38.000* :  of their relentless violence. Eyewitnesses said the first bomber was a mother in her 20s,
*16:38.220- 16:44.120* :  carrying a baby on her back who pretended to be a wedding guest. She stormed the venue in the
*16:44.120- 16:51.100* :  town of Goza and detonated a device. The wounded were rushed to the local hospital, but about 10
*16:51.100- 16:57.160* :  minutes later another blast went off there. As one of the victims was being buried shortly
*16:57.160- 17:03.680* :  afterwards, in accordance with Islam, a teenager disguised herself as a mourner at the funeral
*17:03.680- 17:10.980* :  and set off yet another bomb. Idris Muhammad is a researcher who has analysed and documented
*17:10.980- 17:18.520* :  incidents of terrorism in the town. Goza is at the border with Kemuru far away from the state
*17:18.520- 17:25.480* :  cafeteria and it is one of the most affected community in Bernostate. I think it's recorded the
*17:25.480- 17:30.840* :  highest number of injured people. So there are so many people that are trying to survive.
*17:31.480- 17:36.560* :  There are four days a month in, so it is easier for the Boko Haram members to come and attack
*17:36.560- 17:43.120* :  communities. The authorities have declared a 48 hour curfew in Goza, but long-term solutions
*17:43.160- 17:49.400* :  remain elusive and successive Nigerian governments have failed to stop the bloodshed.
*17:50.020- 17:56.140* :  Poverty, marginalisation and military abuses make it easy for the Islamists to recruit
*17:56.140- 18:03.900* :  more fighters and suicide bombers. In 2015, the previous President Muhammadu Bahari announced
*18:03.900- 18:11.020* :  that Boko Haram had been technically defeated. Nearly a decade later, those words are sounding
*18:11.020- 18:18.340* :  increasingly hollow. Richard Hamilton. The people of St Vincent and the Grenadines are bracing
*18:18.340- 18:24.400* :  themselves for Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 season and earlier in the year
*18:24.400- 18:30.320* :  than normal. Valf González is the Prime Minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines. He's been
*18:30.320- 18:35.300* :  speaking to Owen Bennett Jones. When is the Prime Minister expecting the hurricane to hit?
*18:48.060- 18:54.300* :  He's continuing on that path. The small islands in the Grenadines and then on to St Vincent itself.
*18:54.900- 18:59.940* :  The Hurricane Force winds will hit us by mid-morning, so we are making all the preparations.
*19:00.840- 19:05.160* :  Okay, well, what do the preparations for that look like? Do you move people or do you just build
*19:05.160- 19:10.580* :  barricades? What are you doing? Well, we have shelters all across the country. We are in the shelters
*19:10.580- 19:17.240* :  tonight at this evening at 6 pm and we have district committees. We have a good national emergency
*19:17.240- 19:22.780* :  management organisation. I've had a meeting with them. I'm the chairman of that body
*19:23.580- 19:30.960* :  and we put all systems in place. We have emergency plans for those whose houses may not be able
*19:30.960- 19:41.240* :  to withstand winds 115, 120 and upwards because it's a category four. It will go to 130 and
*19:41.920- 19:47.020* :  higher. We have shelters across the country. We have food supplies and water,
*19:47.660- 19:52.460* :  we put security systems in place. We should be able to ride it out. God willing.
*19:53.140- 19:58.700* :  What happens if some people refuse to go in the shelters? I guess that quite often happens
*19:58.700- 20:04.860* :  in many places. Do you have that issue? We don't have that issue so much. It's just to get them
*20:04.860- 20:09.460* :  to be there on time. You may have some late compmas. I just want them to get on time.
*20:09.700- 20:15.500* :  I've given instructions that I don't want anybody on the streets after 7 pm this evening
*20:15.960- 20:20.640* :  so that we brace ourselves overnight or what is going to happen in the morning and people make
*20:20.640- 20:25.160* :  all their preparations and as say of course the shelters would be open at 6 o'clock with those
*20:25.160- 20:33.060* :  have to go and everybody has his own family emergency plan. We have a good system not perfect but
*20:33.060- 20:39.340* :  it has been honed through many disasters and of course in 2021 we had the volcanic eruptions
*20:39.340- 20:46.060* :  and we had to evacuate one-fifth of the population into shelters. Of course preparing for volcano,
*20:46.060- 20:51.980* :  volcanic eruptions is different in many respects to that of a hurricane but there are some
*20:52.580- 20:56.920* :  similar modalities. We are beginning to prepare for what's going to happen after Monday.
*20:57.660- 21:02.280* :  The seas are very warm. Global warming is not only under earth on the landmass,
*21:03.180- 21:10.660* :  but on the seas and that's facilitating engendering hurricanes and storms of greater
*21:10.660- 21:16.580* :  intensities and frequency. Unfortunately the major emitters are not taking it as serious as they
*21:16.580- 21:22.740* :  should. A lot of talk on it but not a lot of action. Ralph González, Prime Minister of St Vincent
*21:22.740- 21:31.000* :  and the Grenadines. Still to come the BBC uncovers fresh evidence that Israeli troops strapped
*21:31.000- 21:35.640* :  wounded Palestinians to their jeeps during action in the West Bank city of Janine.
*21:44.120- 21:48.520* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Midmobile. With the price of just about everything going up during inflation,
*21:48.520- 21:54.040* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us we brought in a reverse auctioneer which is
*21:54.040- 21:58.460* :  apparently a thing. Midmobile unlimited premium wireless. I'm going to get 30, 30, 30,

*22:49.080- 22:53.740* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his countries troops are engaged in a
*22:53.740- 22:59.720* :  difficult fight with her mass in several areas of Gaza. The most intense clashes in recent days have
*22:59.720- 23:05.580* :  been in a district of Gaza city, but there's also been fighting in other areas and a major operation
*23:05.580- 23:11.760* :  is continuing in the southern city of Raffa. Our Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher sent this report
*23:11.760- 23:12.500* :  from Jerusalem.
*23:18.120- 23:23.560* :  Maunas carried the bodies of six members of the same family killed in Raffa. The local authorities say
*23:23.560- 23:28.520* :  they died when their building was hit in an Israeli strike. The Israeli military says it severely
*23:28.520- 23:34.000* :  degraded the capabilities of three of the four Hamas battalions that it says have been operating
*23:34.000- 23:39.100* :  in the city, but elsewhere, Palestinian fighters have regrouped in areas from which they would
*23:39.100- 23:45.360* :  driven months ago. For the past four days, battle has raged in Machuja'ia district in Gaza City.
*23:45.360- 23:50.700* :  The Israeli army says at least 40 Hamas fighters have been killed and several tunnels destroyed.
*23:50.700- 23:56.180* :  Two Israeli soldiers have been killed while a resident savior sought his left bodies lying in the
*23:56.180- 24:02.240* :  street. Mr Netanyahu says the fighting is being waged above and below ground, sometimes in
*24:02.240- 24:08.020* :  hand-to-hand combat last week. He said the intensive phase of the war was nearing its end,
*24:08.020- 24:13.640* :  but that's not how it feels on the ground in Gaza. Louise Wateridge is a spokesperson
*24:13.640- 24:20.980* :  for UNRA, the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees. She's currently in the Nasirat camp
*24:20.980- 24:26.560* :  in central Gaza. As I speak to you now from the middle area of the Gaza Strip, I can hear
*24:26.560- 24:30.880* :  bombardments everywhere. I can hear them in the south. I can hear them coming from the north.
*24:31.240- 24:36.680* :  This is constant and it just spreads fear for everyone around us. The north is, it's a pock
*24:36.680- 24:41.100* :  elective. There's no other way to describe it. Going through Gaza City everywhere you look,
*24:41.680- 24:46.560* :  the buildings are not buildings anymore. They are shells. You can see life that used to be there.
*24:46.660- 24:52.720* :  And the sad reality is people now are faced with the decision of living back in these buildings.
*24:52.720- 24:57.880* :  They're putting up sheets of plastic or carpet or anything to protect them from the sun now
*24:57.880- 25:02.720* :  at the events of the summer months. Or they're living in and among powers of trash and powers of
*25:02.720- 25:08.960* :  rubbish. There's no water. There's no way to go to the bathroom. It's very, very basic and there's
*25:08.960- 25:14.220* :  very limited supplies available to the population. We have doctors, we have nurses, we have people
*25:14.220- 25:19.440* :  in our clinics, but if we don't have the medicine to give the patients, there's very limited we
*25:19.440- 25:24.460* :  can do. With these access restrictions from the Israeli authorities, it is incredibly difficult,
*25:24.460- 25:30.660* :  if not nearly impossible, for us to deliver humanitarian response. Louise Wateridge of UNRA
*25:30.660- 25:37.240* :  Talking from Central Gaza. Meanwhile, on the occupied West Bank, the BBC has found evidence that
*25:37.240- 25:42.860* :  Israeli troops carried injured Palestinian men on the bonnet of a military jeep, at least three
*25:42.860- 25:49.060* :  times during an operation in Janine last month. Last week, video footage emerged of one man,
*25:49.060- 25:55.020* :  Mujahid Abad-e-Balaz, being driven on the front of an army vehicle, sparking an international
*25:55.020- 26:00.660* :  outcry. The BBC has now spoken to two more people who say the same thing happened to them.
*26:01.320- 26:03.400* :  Lucy Williamson reports from Janine.
*26:08.960- 26:15.220* :  On a winding village road outside Janine, an Israeli military jeep drives past waiting Palestinian
*26:15.220- 26:21.980* :  ambulances, stretched out on its bonnet, a Palestinian man. One arm clinging to the vehicle,
*26:22.580- 26:27.640* :  the other lying motionist across his body, with what appears to be a large blood stain near the
*26:27.640- 26:35.440* :  shoulder. The figure on the bonnet was 23-year-old Mujahid Abad-e-Balaz, shot during an Israeli operation
*26:35.440- 26:44.180* :  last weekend. More than a week on, Mujahid is lying in a hospital bed. The gunshot wounds to his
*26:44.180- 26:50.480* :  leg and shoulder, framed with external metal fixtures, burns on his back from the hot metal
*26:50.480- 27:00.380* :  of the military jeep. They were beating me on the injury in my leg and shoulder. They were
*27:00.380- 27:07.080* :  checking where my injuries were and beating me there. He shows me another video in which a group
*27:07.080- 27:16.740* :  of soldiers appear to pick him up and throw him onto the vehicle. I was saying my final prayers,
*27:16.740- 27:23.320* :  I was expecting to die. Mujahid's story caused international outrage,
*27:23.340- 27:34.420* :  but it's not the only one. In the hospital, we also met Samir Dabaya, shot in the back
*27:34.420- 27:44.340* :  during the same military raid. And he says, carried to an army vehicle, stripped of his trousers
*27:44.380- 27:50.760* :  and thrown onto the bonnet. A few brief seconds of footage from a nearby security camera
*27:51.300- 27:58.840* :  appear to show him half naked, on the same army jeep. Both men say they were shot around a house
*27:58.840- 28:05.500* :  in the Jabriat area of Janine as Israeli forces came to arrest a wanted man. The walls there
*28:05.780- 28:14.080* :  still marked by sniper fire. At the house, a third man, her shy misled, a large bandage on
*28:14.080- 28:21.900* :  his leg, shows me the olive grove where he says he too was shot and then forced onto the hot metal
*28:21.900- 28:32.300* :  bonnet of the same military vehicle. I tried to put my hand on the jeep. I couldn't. It was
*28:32.300- 28:38.500* :  burning hot, but they forced me saying that I should get on it if I didn't want to die.
*28:39.140- 28:47.040* :  All three men were later released by Israeli forces. The army said Majahid's case violated
*28:47.040- 28:52.960* :  orders and procedures and would be investigated and that the new allegations we put to them
*28:52.960- 29:03.980* :  were under review. During an Israeli operation this week, bombs buried deep in the roads hit troops
*29:03.980- 29:11.640* :  as they drove in, killing one soldier and wounding 16 others. This battle began long before the
*29:11.640- 29:18.580* :  Gaza war, but tactics here on both sides are shifting in its wake and the behavior of Israeli troops
*29:19.020- 29:25.480* :  is under scrutiny here too. This is different territory to Gaza, but it's the same adversaries,
*29:26.260- 29:35.880* :  the same war. Lucy Williamson. Australia is bringing in some of the toughest legislation in the
*29:35.880- 29:42.060* :  world around vaping. From Monday, the sale of e-cigarettes outside of pharmacies will be prohibited,
*29:42.140- 29:48.880* :  a measure designed to curtail a boom in youth vaping as are Australia correspondent Katie Watson
*29:48.880- 29:54.080* :  now reports from Sydney. Australia had wanted to be a world first in banning vaping without
*29:54.080- 29:58.840* :  prescription, but opposition from the green party has meant that original plan got watered down.
*29:58.840- 30:04.740* :  As of Monday, it will be illegal to supply, manufacture, import or sell a vape outside of pharmacy
*30:05.280- 30:10.400* :  that applies to all e-cigarettes whether they have nicotine or not. Those purchasing a vape will
*30:10.400- 30:15.160* :  have to have a prescription until October. After that, they'll be able to buy one after having
*30:15.160- 30:19.560* :  a conversation with their pharmacist. Under 18, though, we'll still need a prescription.
*30:20.320- 30:24.960* :  Australia has some of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the world. It banned the import of vapes
*30:24.960- 30:31.320* :  earlier this year and limited the number of flavours that can be sold. In 2012, Australia also became
*30:31.320- 30:36.120* :  the first country to pass the law on plain packaging for tobacco products, reducing its marketing
*30:36.120- 30:42.480* :  appeal. Glastonbury is the largest music festival in Europe. It's held in the west of England
*30:42.480- 30:47.440* :  every summer. Thousands of music lovers camp out, hoping to get a glimpse of some of their
*30:47.440- 30:53.920* :  favourite artists. Headliners at this year's 5-day festival have included cold play and duolipa,
*30:54.020- 30:59.480* :  but there's also been a new addition to the stage, the voice of Batchaprot, the first
*30:59.480- 31:06.300* :  Indonesian band to play there. The band's made up of three women in hijabs. They've been talking
*31:06.300- 31:08.820* :  to our culture reporter, Nor Nanji.
*31:13.820- 31:18.240* :  Hello, my name is Marcia. I'm the guitarist and vocalist. My name is C.T. I'm a drummer.
*31:18.960- 31:23.480* :  I'm really, I'm a bass player. I mean, you're the first Indonesian band to play at Glastonbury.
*31:23.480- 31:31.260* :  How does that feel? Very excited. So proud. And also, this is a big responsibility because we
*31:31.260- 31:39.340* :  become the representation of Indonesia. I bet a little bit nervous. We are so proud to be here.
*31:48.800- 31:53.960* :  What's it like to be an all-female metal band in a Muslim country? Have you faced a lot of obstacles?
*31:54.840- 32:02.100* :  First, yeah, because many people misunderstood about metal music. But now, after they
*32:02.100- 32:09.400* :  knew that metal music is just medium for us to express ourself, they give us full support.
*32:14.460- 32:18.840* :  What is the reaction been to your music in the UK and also at home? Have you had a positive
*32:18.840- 32:30.280* :  reaction? On 26th June, we are performing in London. So many people came to our show and they
*32:30.280- 32:33.220* :  are very supportive and excited about our show.
*32:42.520- 32:46.320* :  And this is your first time in the UK. Do you like it? Yeah, I like it so much.
*32:46.320- 32:52.220* :  But it's called... Sorry about that. Hopefully, the sun comes out soon. Good luck with your set.
*32:52.220- 32:53.700* :  Thank you so much.
*33:05.620- 33:09.000* :  Nore Nanji there with the members of the Voice of Batchaprot.
*33:11.680- 33:16.140* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:16.700- 33:21.240* :  If you want to comment on this podcast, all the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.

*33:29.340- 33:35.020* :  This edition was mixed by Ricardo McCarthy and the producer was marked off. The editor is Karen
*33:35.020- 33:38.460* :  Martin. I'm Bernadette Kio. Until next time, goodbye.
