*01:25.860- 01:30.820* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 6th of June.
*01:31.200- 01:35.880* :  Western leaders and World War II veterans are in northern France to mark the 80th anniversary
*01:35.880- 01:40.700* :  of the D-Day landings. We're living at a time when democracy is more at risk across the world
*01:41.500- 01:47.240* :  than at a point since the end of World War II since these beaches were stormed in 1944.
*01:48.220- 01:53.100* :  Israel has defended an airstrike that's reported to have killed dozens of people sheltering in
*01:53.100- 01:58.500* :  a school in Gaza, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters. And the Netherlands has kicked off
*01:58.500- 02:06.920* :  four days of voting across Europe. Also in the podcast, in the latest cleanup of Himalayan
*02:06.920- 02:12.380* :  peaks, the Nepalese army finds 11 tons of rubbish and four dead bodies.
*02:17.120- 02:22.780* :  We begin in northern France where world leaders and surviving World War II veterans have been
*02:22.780- 02:28.220* :  marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Today's events began with a British military
*02:28.220- 02:32.160* :  piper coming ashore on Gold Beach at the moment the assault began.
*02:41.240- 02:49.740* :  It was just before 6.30 in the morning on the 6th of June 1944, but more than 150,000 troops
*02:49.740- 02:55.880* :  from Britain, America, Canada and France began what was to become the world's largest seaborn
*02:55.880- 03:01.600* :  invasion. After wading onto the Normandy beaches, they had to fight their way past heavy German
*03:01.600- 03:07.220* :  defences to begin the liberation of France from the Nazis. In a speech at the new British
*03:07.220- 03:12.680* :  war memorial near Gold Beach, King Charles paid tribute to the men who took part in the assault.
*03:12.700- 03:21.800* :  It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all those who served at
*03:21.800- 03:30.600* :  that critical time. We recall a lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades.
*03:32.460- 03:39.660* :  Three nations must stand together to oppose tyranny. The British monarch's words were echoed by
*03:39.660- 03:45.900* :  the French president Emmanuel Macron. France will never forget the British troops who
*03:45.900- 03:53.380* :  landed on D-Day and all their brothers in arm, that face and freedom which you have never lost,
*03:54.540- 04:03.620* :  that constant selflessness and devotion both guide us and serve as a duty to us.
*04:05.200- 04:12.180* :  We are honored by the size of remembrance, friendship and loyalty which are fought
*04:13.120- 04:19.020* :  between our two countries. Before the speeches, there were reenactments of the landings as we heard
*04:19.020- 04:25.640* :  from our correspondent Husekovil. We're coasting along but a mile off the shore. We're right opposite
*04:25.640- 04:31.500* :  as I speak the memorial for the British at the advance of your men, and I can see it quite clearly
*04:31.500- 04:36.720* :  it's a very bright, very calm, slightly chilly day but it's lovely and I can see that the memorial
*04:36.720- 04:43.340* :  up on the hill above Goldbeach where 80 years ago the men were beginning to pour ashore. We're
*04:43.640- 04:51.260* :  heading along the coast westwards. We're going to go ashore near Anya and then the men here and
*04:51.260- 04:58.080* :  women are going to push ahead on the 14 mile jump as they call it across which they did then
*04:58.460- 05:04.460* :  across the port on Bessar. A very important target on D-Day which they had to capture in order to
*05:04.820- 05:09.600* :  facilitate the opening up of Mulberry High or after that and they're doing it they say
*05:09.820- 05:17.220* :  out of respect or honor the memory and to make sure that it is passed on there. All the marines
*05:17.220- 05:22.100* :  here are saying to me the older ones because it's very important that it becomes part of the collective
*05:22.480- 05:28.680* :  free the core of the Mando part of the British Navy so they're doing it and we'll be meeting
*05:28.680- 05:35.720* :  quite shortly with three other landing craft and going ashore ourselves. Huseko field. Well 98-year-old
*05:35.720- 05:44.100* :  Stan Mintcher was a midshipman in the Royal Navy in 1944. On D-Day at the age of 18 he was second
*05:44.100- 05:49.260* :  in command of a landing craft taking troops to Juno Beach and was among the first to step ashore.
*05:49.580- 05:53.320* :  Nick Robinson asked him whether he realized how historic the mission was.
*05:54.000- 06:00.860* :  I think we knew it was significant but we of course didn't know any details how many people were
*06:00.860- 06:07.840* :  involved, where we were going, what would happen, would it be easy or not? We were only a very small
*06:07.840- 06:15.040* :  cog in a very big wheel. We sailed from Southampton expecting to go further but we were
*06:15.040- 06:22.340* :  delayed and we mourned and awakened just off the hour of white. We were there overnight loaded
*06:22.340- 06:29.060* :  with troops and tanks. They were getting a bit ashy. We didn't have any wireless. The flag messages
*06:29.060- 06:36.620* :  came through. We were departing in the evening. We got into a convoy. It was apprehensive. It was
*06:36.620- 06:43.160* :  dark. We saw the mines people come ahead of us. We didn't know they were coming. It was strange to
*06:43.160- 06:49.520* :  see them come past us. We wonder what they were for until we realized what they were. Curiosity
*06:49.520- 06:55.360* :  I think was the major instinct. What are your memories of approaching the coast?
*06:56.240- 07:02.600* :  We got there fairly early and we were told by the sort of leader that we got to hang about.
*07:02.620- 07:09.900* :  So we went down the big circles and I was watching the next speech, not ours. I was
*07:09.900- 07:17.120* :  watching strange big flashes of light. The mobile tanks were coming to shore and blowing up.
*07:17.420- 07:21.840* :  We were just wondering what on earth was happening as we went around and around waiting for the
*07:21.840- 07:28.100* :  message. People were dying. The Germans were defending the beach. The navy was bombarding it.
*07:28.500- 07:33.680* :  The landing craft were approaching the beach, fighting the troops and trying to get
*07:34.780- 07:39.880* :  as quickly as they could. But it was a long range. I could just see one or two fires going up.
*07:40.180- 07:47.200* :  So you're looking through your binoculars witnessing these horrific scenes. What's in your mind
*07:47.200- 07:53.640* :  at the time as an 18-year-old midshipman? It wasn't really a worry. We were dying to get
*07:53.640- 08:01.480* :  a shore and do our job. We were going around in circles about three or four miles off the beach
*08:02.360- 08:09.200* :  because the powers that be were going over some rocks. We had to wait till they were covered.
*08:09.800- 08:15.380* :  It's a wait for the water to rise. Indeed. We should have landed when the beach was perhaps
*08:15.880- 08:22.060* :  three or four hundred yards wide. When we actually got a shore, it was more like a hundred yards wide.
*08:22.060- 08:28.080* :  When we left, it was ten yards wide. So it was getting very difficult for troops to get a
*08:28.380- 08:34.540* :  shore. And how worried were you that you would come under attack from German fire? Not a lot.
*08:34.540- 08:41.340* :  We were told by a beach party that that's the naval people on the beach that was a sniper in
*08:41.340- 08:49.620* :  the house on the key, but before I can enter the windows, which I did. In about five minutes,
*08:50.000- 08:55.820* :  they told us to stop. Possibly they'd taken the beach by that time. Did you think before that
*08:55.820- 09:03.880* :  night, Stan, I may never return? No, definitely not. We just felt we had to do a job and we
*09:03.880- 09:08.920* :  wanted to do it as quickly as we possibly could. And is that, do you think, Stan, because that's
*09:08.920- 09:15.500* :  how 18-year-olds think they don't often look ahead to what could go wrong? Or was it because you
*09:15.500- 09:20.960* :  had a sense of that this was your duty? This was what the country needed you to do? Well, both,
*09:20.960- 09:26.040* :  I think, but I think it's 18. You see the world. It was very different guys than you do later on.
*09:26.540- 09:34.700* :  Nick Robinson talking to Normandy veteran 98-year-old Stan Mincher, who was just 18 in 1944. And we'll hear
*09:34.700- 09:40.700* :  more on the D-Day commemorations at the end of the podcast. The White House has today issued
*09:40.700- 09:47.940* :  a statement on behalf of 17 countries calling on Hamas and Israel to make whatever compromises
*09:47.940- 09:54.300* :  are needed to reach an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza. It came hours after
*09:54.300- 09:59.440* :  Israel carried out an airstrike on a school in the Palestinian territory. The Israelis say they
*09:59.440- 10:05.760* :  quote, eliminated a number of terrorists in a hidden Hamas compound. A Hamas official said 40
*10:05.760- 10:11.660* :  people, including women and children, were killed sheltering at the UN site. This man described
*10:16.440- 10:22.120* :  what happened. We were sleeping when we suddenly saw a rocket falling on us. On the second floor
*10:22.120- 10:28.520* :  there were martyrs and on the first there were injured. That's all we saw. We must thank God
*10:28.520- 10:34.840* :  because he looks after us. As I say, I was asleep when I found myself covered in rubble. The
*10:34.840- 10:41.260* :  rocket hit. It came through the second floor. We came out to help the people and the martyrs.
*10:42.520- 10:49.080* :  According to US officials, Hamas still has 9 to 12,000 fighters in Gaza, down from an estimated
*10:49.080- 10:56.040* :  20 to 25,000 when it launched the massacre on the 7th of October. This week the Israelis have
*10:56.040- 11:01.860* :  carried out a new operation in the center of the Palestinian territory. For more on the latest
*11:01.860- 11:07.040* :  airstrike, I spoke to our correspondent Yolanda Nell in Jerusalem. The Israeli military gave a
*11:07.040- 11:12.320* :  briefing earlier. It called this precision intelligence-based strike targeting three classrooms
*11:12.320- 11:18.280* :  in this UNRA school in the Nussonat Urban Refugee Camp in the center of Gaza. The Israeli
*11:18.280- 11:23.460* :  military said that there were 20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters who were holed up there,
*11:23.860- 11:29.100* :  including people involved in the 7th of October attacks on southern Israel, which killed about
*11:29.100- 11:34.560* :  1,200 people. The Israeli military spokesman said he was confident that many of those have
*11:34.560- 11:39.740* :  been killed in this strike. He said they would have been feeling relatively safe in this UN building.
*11:39.740- 11:45.880* :  But this is just the latest instance we've got where displaced people have been caught up
*11:46.240- 11:52.720* :  in Israeli strikes and what they say are Hamas targets. We've been hearing of about 40 people
*11:52.720- 11:58.680* :  killed. More than 70 wounded. That's according to the media office of the Hamas run government.
*11:58.700- 12:04.900* :  But it's also Palestinian medics of the Al-Aqsa martyrs hospital who have been receiving the
*12:04.900- 12:09.280* :  dead and injured have been telling us similar figures and saying that there are women and children
*12:09.280- 12:13.120* :  who are among the dead, although the scenes there are quite chaotic and where we're struggling
*12:13.120- 12:19.200* :  to get exact numbers. In cases like this Israel says it always tries to minimize civilian casualties.
*12:19.260- 12:24.500* :  What does that actually entail in terms of protecting the people who are caught up in the fighting?
*12:24.840- 12:29.440* :  In this case what the Israeli military says is that it caught off the strike twice to limit the
*12:29.440- 12:35.140* :  number of civilians that could potentially be caught up in it. And I guess the timing in the early
*12:35.140- 12:40.460* :  hours of the morning would have been meant to kind of reduce the numbers of civilian casualties.
*12:40.460- 12:46.820* :  That's what they would say. But of course this is a building that is just full of displaced people,
*12:46.820- 12:51.860* :  families who have been sheltering there. The BBC spoke to one man who told us he was originally
*12:51.860- 12:58.100* :  from Gaza City. They had moved down to Harnunas in the south and accordance with Israeli evacuation
*12:58.260- 13:04.380* :  orders earlier in the war. Then that got bombed so he said they moved to Rafa and then just recently
*13:04.380- 13:10.740* :  they had moved to the centre of the Gaza Strip to escape Israel's military offensive in the very
*13:10.740- 13:15.600* :  south of Gaza and found just two weeks later that the school they were in, the shelter they were
*13:15.600- 13:21.280* :  in was bombed. And he just said you know he claimed Israel was violating international laws
*13:21.680- 13:24.380* :  and said that all red lines had been crossed in this war.
*13:24.740- 13:30.100* :  Yeah, I'm now in Jerusalem. The Netherlands has kicked off four days of voting across Europe
*13:30.560- 13:37.160* :  as some 370 million people in 27 countries choose who they want to represent them in the European
*13:37.160- 13:43.920* :  Parliament. Far right parties are expected to make gains in the 720 member chamber in what could be
*13:43.920- 13:50.000* :  a significant shift for the European Union. Ankara Spondent and a Holigen is outside a rather quiet
*13:50.000- 13:56.440* :  polling station in the Hague. I've seen more dog walkers than I have voters so far here this morning.
*13:56.440- 14:03.400* :  That's partly because of political fatigue. This country is still reeling from the results of an
*14:03.400- 14:08.380* :  election, parliamentary election back in November. They're still in the process of forming the new
*14:08.380- 14:15.220* :  government. It will be all eyes on here, Vilders, who has is the leader of the biggest party here in
*14:15.220- 14:20.840* :  the Netherlands now, the anti-immigration freedom party. And he's been trying to present these
*14:20.840- 14:28.960* :  European Parliament elections as a vote on climate issues interestingly. And what we're seeing here
*14:28.960- 14:33.960* :  according to the most recent polls is that people are divided. This is a polarized society.
*14:33.960- 14:41.140* :  People are split on things like climate, so the greens and the left parties are expected to
*14:41.140- 14:47.060* :  make gains at the same time as the radical right. But there are other issues on people's minds as
*14:47.060- 14:54.420* :  they head into these polling stations. The cost of living crisis, global instability, conflict in
*14:54.420- 15:00.180* :  Ukraine, in Gaza. And what the radical right has been doing here in the Netherlands, but right
*15:00.180- 15:06.340* :  across the continent is trying to conflate these issues. So people who are worried about inflation,
*15:06.420- 15:15.620* :  rocketing rents, the price of homes are being told that immigration and an EU push to
*15:17.300- 15:22.320* :  bring about a green transition is partly to blame for why people are feeling as though
*15:22.320- 15:26.820* :  they don't have enough money to spend. So that is what many people here in the Netherlands
*15:26.820- 15:31.220* :  and across the continent are thinking. But as people have been going in, I've been asking them
*15:31.220- 15:36.840* :  why they're casting their ballot today. And what I hear over and over again is that they feel
*15:36.840- 15:41.840* :  the future of Europe is at stake here and this is their opportunity to make a difference.
*15:41.840- 15:47.120* :  And bearing in mind that the European Parliament makes decisions on laws which will affect
*15:47.120- 15:53.920* :  everybody here in the Netherlands and beyond. And a hologon in the hake. A week after Donald Trump
*15:53.920- 15:59.540* :  was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records, the former president has had
*15:59.540- 16:04.560* :  some good news from the courts. A more serious criminal case against him in the state of Georgia
*16:04.560- 16:10.140* :  has been paused. It centers on accusations Mr Trump tried to subvert the result of the 2020
*16:10.140- 16:16.040* :  presidential election. Our Washington correspondent Will Vernon told Paul Moss all about it.
*16:16.660- 16:21.300* :  In the Georgia case, Mr Trump and several of his associates are charged with alleged attempts
*16:21.300- 16:26.980* :  to overturn the election results in Georgia, Joe Biden won the state by a very slim majority,
*16:26.980- 16:32.640* :  less than 13,000 votes four years ago. And Donald Trump and his co-defendants are accused of
*16:32.980- 16:38.520* :  basically putting pressure on state officials in Georgia to change the results and peddling false
*16:38.520- 16:44.420* :  claims of electoral fraud as well as trying to appoint fake electors to certify a completely
*16:44.420- 16:49.620* :  different result in the state. So it's a pretty serious case. In serious indeed, so given that,
*16:49.620- 16:55.000* :  what has the case been paused? Well, it's been put on hold while an appeals process takes place
*16:55.060- 17:00.620* :  and this appeal is against a ruling by the judge earlier this year in response to an attempt by the
*17:00.620- 17:06.960* :  Trump legal team to dismiss the chief prosecutor, Fanny Willis, over an improper relationship she had
*17:06.960- 17:11.920* :  with one of the lawyers on her team, Nathan Wade. So the Trump team said that was a conflict of
*17:11.920- 17:16.220* :  interest. She should be dismissed, but the judge ruled that she could stay in the case
*17:16.220- 17:21.720* :  can proceed, although Mr Wade did then resign. So this appeal is against that ruling and it
*17:21.720- 17:28.400* :  won't be heard now until October. That will take time, so the main case will not come to court
*17:28.400- 17:33.880* :  before the presidential election on the 5th of November. And Paul, that suits Donald Trump absolutely
*17:33.880- 17:39.420* :  fine. Thank you very much, because the former president's legal strategy so far across all the
*17:39.420- 17:46.540* :  criminal cases he's faced has been the 3Ds, right? Distract delay and dismiss. Mr Trump is now
*17:46.540- 17:52.580* :  hanging all his hopes on winning that crucial election this November. And if he does win,
*17:52.960- 17:59.540* :  then there'll be a range of options to dismiss or delay the remaining 3 cases. So he had 4 criminal
*17:59.540- 18:04.820* :  cases against him, didn't he? One of those concluded last week in New York when he was found guilty
*18:04.820- 18:10.620* :  for falsifying business records. There are now 3 left. So if Mr Trump does win the election,
*18:10.680- 18:15.180* :  he can quite easily dismiss or delay those most legal experts think anyway.
*18:15.620- 18:20.560* :  Well, Vernon in Washington. It's been called the highest rubbish dump in the world. Now,
*18:20.560- 18:27.320* :  Nepalese soldiers have collected 11 tons of refuse and four dead bodies from Mount Everest and two
*18:27.320- 18:33.000* :  other Himalayan peaks. The army said it took 55 days to recover the garbage left by climbing
*18:33.000- 18:37.480* :  teams. I heard more from our South Asia regional editor and Barrisan Etirajan.
*18:38.060- 18:43.060* :  I have to give you a friendly caution. What I'm going to say may not be very pleasant,
*18:43.060- 18:51.400* :  if not smelly now. On the Everest itself, you see, you know, discarded oxygen canisters and then
*18:51.400- 18:58.840* :  tens and then food containers and human faces. And now the Nepalese army, they have been trying
*18:58.840- 19:05.420* :  to bring back because even many mountaineers, they come and talk about how bad the situation, how
*19:05.920- 19:10.820* :  stinky in the up in the mountains. Even though it is very romantic climbing up the Mount Everest,
*19:11.360- 19:15.840* :  they have to go through this like simply crossover dead bodies and then you see the
*19:16.280- 19:21.780* :  human waste scattered everywhere. That was the situation and that is why this cleanup campaign.
*19:21.780- 19:26.520* :  Now, if you go on the way to the Everest base camp itself, there are many tea houses.
*19:26.520- 19:31.900* :  Many of these toilets are directly going into a plastic barrel and these barrels are usually
*19:31.900- 19:37.780* :  taken to the nearby villages where they dig a huge pit and then they dump these human waste and
*19:37.780- 19:42.720* :  other things. So the more and more people visiting this pristine Himalayan environment,
*19:42.780- 19:47.580* :  what do you see there is more pollution, that is why environmentalists are calling for,
*19:47.580- 19:51.840* :  we're not putting a cap on the number of people climbing mountains like Everest.
*19:52.320- 19:57.500* :  Yeah, how much of an environmental hazard does it pose, given that it is pretty cold up in the
*19:57.500- 20:03.900* :  mountains? That is a big issue because up in the mountain, it's just freezing temperatures,
*20:03.900- 20:09.800* :  you have snow. So whatever you leave there like a human waste or dead body, they don't get decomposed,
*20:09.800- 20:16.000* :  they stay as they are and as and when in the glaciers they melt, the waters they bring them down,
*20:16.000- 20:20.520* :  actually they go even sometimes under the ground where the glaciers constantly moving,
*20:20.520- 20:26.400* :  the eyes keep pushing them down and all these waste suddenly comes up in the waterways and they
*20:26.400- 20:32.480* :  goes downstream to the people where they are consuming waters and that is a huge, huge health
*20:32.480- 20:37.860* :  issue for people. You know, people get sometimes a cholera, they're warnings about all kinds of
*20:37.860- 20:43.120* :  diseases and that is one of the major reasons why people are saying they have to find a way,
*20:43.120- 20:48.400* :  how to dispose these waste. You know, there are no roads from the town of Lukla all the way
*20:48.400- 20:55.640* :  up to the base camp, you have to really walk or take it by ponies or yak, the cattle there.
*20:55.980- 21:00.940* :  So all these plastic barrels of human waste and other stuff are being brought back and dumped in
*21:00.940- 21:06.820* :  the villages and that is why the huge calls for restricting the number of people going up in the
*21:06.820- 21:12.580* :  mountains because they don't get decomposed so that is the huge, huge problem faced by the local
*21:12.580- 21:16.220* :  communities. South Asia, regional editor and Barassan Etirracha.
*21:18.500- 21:23.360* :  And still to come on the global news podcast, riding the profitable wave of AI.

*22:53.740- 22:59.400* :  The military junta in Myanmar has been on the back foot since an alliance of three ethnic rebel
*22:59.400- 23:04.200* :  groups began an offensive last year. Over the past few months, it's lost control of huge
*23:04.200- 23:09.840* :  swathes of territory, but the armed forces have continued to launch attacks of their own,
*23:10.360- 23:15.040* :  with civilians often caught up in the fighting. In the latest incident, the military is accused
*23:15.040- 23:20.620* :  of killing at least 50 people detained in a village close to Situeh, capital of Rakhine State.
*23:21.280- 23:24.540* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head told me what happened.
*23:25.400- 23:30.820* :  Well, we've managed to speak to residents of this village called BIPU. It's just on the outskirts
*23:30.820- 23:36.680* :  of Situeh, which is the biggest town, the main hub in Rakhine State, and also the last stronghold
*23:36.680- 23:41.540* :  where the military still has significant forces. It's been driven out of almost all of Rakhine State
*23:41.540- 23:48.940* :  by the insurgent Arachan army. What the survivors of this incident have told us is that last Wednesday,
*23:49.020- 23:54.760* :  more than 100 soldiers occupied their village, ordered everybody out of their houses.
*23:54.860- 24:00.840* :  The entire population was made to line up on roads leading to the marketplace in the sun.
*24:00.840- 24:06.740* :  They were kept there for more than two days. In that time, groups of three to five were taken away
*24:06.780- 24:13.120* :  by the soldiers to be interrogated to find out whether they were supporting the Arachan army,
*24:13.120- 24:18.680* :  which is quite close by. What these eyewitnesses have described to us is beyond horrific.
*24:18.700- 24:23.760* :  All those not being interrogated were made to keep their heads down, but they could hear
*24:24.340- 24:30.660* :  these brutal interrogations going on. The men being blindfolded in beaten and multiple gunshots
*24:30.660- 24:36.240* :  and a number of the men were then taken away to military bases. The women and children
*24:36.240- 24:42.000* :  and the elderly were after two days then ordered to leave the town, and it was only then they were
*24:42.000- 24:46.640* :  able to get a look at what had happened. They say they saw numerous bodies left on the streets.
*24:46.640- 24:51.540* :  They're now sheltering in monasteries. This is a population of over 2,000 people. They say that
*24:51.540- 24:55.560* :  dozens of the men are missing. They believe at least 50 of them have been killed.
*24:56.480- 25:02.780* :  And does this sound like the kind of attacks seen by the military in Rakhine State in the past?
*25:02.780- 25:07.880* :  Of course, that was where they carried out assaults against the Rohingya population.
*25:08.480- 25:14.440* :  This is a bit different because the Arachan army is backed by the majority Rakhine Buddhist
*25:14.440- 25:19.480* :  population, who in the past have had a confrontation relationship with the Rohingyas. The Rohingyas themselves
*25:19.480- 25:25.140* :  have also been caught up in this conflict. It's a very complex mixed situation, but the Arachan army
*25:25.140- 25:31.260* :  is essentially ethnic Rakhine, and this village was ethnic Rakhine. Rohingyas were not directly
*25:31.260- 25:37.080* :  involved, although the Arachan army has actually accused some Rohingyas of supporting joining the
*25:37.080- 25:41.380* :  army. Now we know that Rohingyas have been forcefully conscripted into the army. It just adds to
*25:41.380- 25:46.440* :  the complexity of this, but this particular massacre is from what I can see, one of the worst
*25:46.440- 25:51.560* :  incidents of this civil war so far. And most of the army's attacks in Rakhine, and it's been
*25:51.560- 25:56.280* :  fierce fighting there since the beginning of the year, have involved air power firing rockets
*25:56.280- 26:01.180* :  in artillery. That's killed a lot of civilians, but that's an army on the retreat. This is the
*26:01.180- 26:05.720* :  army coming out of its stronghold and is it way to a village its suspects is supporting the
*26:05.720- 26:10.500* :  insurgents who are defeating the military everywhere else, and simply going after the population.
*26:10.720- 26:16.320* :  The eyewitnesses describe the soldiers as being drunk, stealing valuables from the homes. We now
*26:16.320- 26:20.260* :  believe because people are not allowed back into this village that a large part of it is being burnt
*26:20.260- 26:26.200* :  down. This is really, you know, absolute basic brutal behavior by an army which has got its back
*26:26.200- 26:32.340* :  to the wall. Jonathan Heard, our southeast Asia correspondent. It may not be a household name,
*26:32.340- 26:37.460* :  but Nvidia has just become the second most valuable publicly listed company in the world.
*26:37.500- 26:41.880* :  The microchip firm, which has been at the heart of the boom in artificial intelligence,
*26:41.880- 26:48.820* :  has overtaken Apple after its market value topped three trillion dollars. We heard more about
*26:48.820- 26:54.240* :  Nvidia from our business reporter, Nick Marsh. It's actually been around for more than 30 years.
*26:54.240- 26:59.140* :  It's a Silicon Valley based company chip maker of course, but its incredible surge recently
*26:59.760- 27:05.680* :  is really thanks to the artificial intelligence boom. They started making off chips for computer
*27:05.680- 27:11.900* :  games at the very beginning, but quite quickly they moved towards machine learning and Nvidia bet
*27:11.900- 27:16.920* :  very big and very early on AI. So right now it specializes in making the chips that power
*27:16.920- 27:23.360* :  accelerators, which is basically the hardware that processes the workload of artificial intelligence
*27:23.360- 27:29.360* :  systems. Its rivals basically can't catch up. It's done so well. Everyone wants Nvidia chips.
*27:29.360- 27:35.340* :  Tesla is a big customer. Oli Elon Musk said they'd be spending between three and four billion
*27:35.340- 27:40.800* :  dollars on Nvidia hardware. So they can't stop making money. In the first four years of this
*27:40.800- 27:47.160* :  month, they made $26 billion. Triple what they made the year before and their second only to
*27:47.160- 27:53.960* :  Microsoft. Now in terms of value, Microsoft by the way, who've been investing in, you guessed it,
*27:53.960- 27:59.920* :  open AI, who make chat GPT. Now, like many companies in Silicon Valley,
*27:59.920- 28:05.740* :  its boss, Jensen Huang is is something of a rock star. Tell us more about him. Yeah, we are seeing
*28:05.740- 28:11.640* :  this trend of tech celebrities who gained these followings. Jensen Huang could be another one.
*28:11.640- 28:16.000* :  He was born in Taiwan. He moved to the States when he was nine years old, went on to co-found
*28:16.000- 28:22.720* :  this $3 trillion company. He was actually back in Taiwan this week for the Computex Expo.
*28:23.260- 28:27.180* :  And it really was like a rock star coming home. I mean, there was crowds of screaming fans.
*28:27.180- 28:32.860* :  He was wearing his leather jacket that he always wears. He was signing women's t-shirts. You know,
*28:32.860- 28:39.620* :  it was quite something. And his company only looks set to rise as AI rises other companies,
*28:39.620- 28:45.280* :  like TSMC, for example, who make the actual chips and video designs them. It's almost going to
*28:45.280- 28:49.580* :  physically make them. They're loving this as well, because the better Nvidia does, the more that
*28:49.580- 28:56.200* :  these chip manufacturers like TSMC, their share prices increase as well. TSMC hit a record
*28:56.200- 29:02.080* :  high today in Taiwan. So it all depends on how far artificial intelligence can go. But today,
*29:02.080- 29:06.920* :  Oli, I can tell you that no one is complaining. Our business reporter, Nick Marsh. Now, as you
*29:06.920- 29:13.660* :  probably heard, this is a big year for elections by the end of 2024, more than two billion voters
*29:13.660- 29:19.060* :  will have had a chance to go to the polls in more than 50 countries with the US, Georgia,
*29:19.060- 29:24.100* :  and Sri Lanka still to come. Here in the UK, the general election has been called for the fourth
*29:24.100- 29:29.300* :  of July, just four weeks from today. And it's shaping up to be one for the history books with
*29:29.300- 29:35.620* :  both main parties needing to break records in order to win a majority. Here on the global news
*29:35.620- 29:40.060* :  podcast, we'd like to answer your questions ahead of the votes, whether you're a Brit living
*29:40.060- 29:45.200* :  abroad, a world service listener here in the UK, or just a fan of British politics living somewhere
*29:45.200- 29:50.840* :  else in the world. So if there's something you'd like to ask, please email us on global podcast
*29:50.840- 30:01.420* :  at bbc.co.uk. That's global podcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x at global news pod.
*30:01.420- 30:06.440* :  And we look forward to hearing from you. Now, we'll return to our top story, the D-Day
*30:06.440- 30:12.540* :  commemorations in northern France, 80 years after Allied troops landed on the Normandy beaches
*30:12.540- 30:17.580* :  to begin the liberation of Europe in the Second World War. Shortly before we recorded this podcast,
*30:18.180- 30:22.180* :  the US President Joe Biden spoke at the American Cemetery in Normandy.
*30:48.640- 30:51.060* :  My answer is yes, only can be yes.
*30:53.280- 30:57.280* :  Well, there was one notable absence among the world leaders at the commemorations,
*30:57.280- 31:03.100* :  the Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't invited, despite the contribution made by the Soviet
*31:03.100- 31:08.200* :  Union in ending the Second World War. Ukrainian soldiers were part of that effort,
*31:08.200- 31:13.560* :  and Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky was at the commemoration today. Our Europe editor
*31:13.560- 31:17.260* :  Kache Adler is on the Normandy coast and gave us this assessment.
*31:17.880- 31:25.000* :  All the talk is about freedom and democracy and international togetherness. But of course,
*31:25.000- 31:31.260* :  at the same time, there is a war raging again in Europe, but the scale not seen since 1945,
*31:31.260- 31:36.460* :  since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And here at the international ceremony, you will see a
*31:36.460- 31:42.200* :  conspicuous absence, because of course, on the eastern front, Russia was pivotal in defeating
*31:42.200- 31:49.280* :  Nazi Germany. But Vladimir Putin has not been invited today. The president of Ukraine has.
*31:49.280- 31:57.720* :  So while the talk and the thought about wars ended yesterday, there is one raging right now
*31:57.720- 32:04.640* :  with concerns of further instability across this continent. So it's very important for the Western
*32:04.640- 32:09.800* :  Allies who are gathering here and we'll see 25 heads of state, heads of government and members
*32:10.280- 32:16.460* :  of the European royal family, including the Prince of Wales gathering at the international
*32:16.520- 32:22.480* :  commemoration in a bit. It's important for them to show signs of Western cohesion,
*32:22.580- 32:28.740* :  and it's a direct message to Russia, because we're talking about the Allies, the Allies who
*32:28.740- 32:34.760* :  landed here on the beaches and helped turn the tide in the Second World War. But even amongst
*32:34.760- 32:40.020* :  the Allies who stand behind Ukraine, there are divisions. You know, there's stressors and strains
*32:40.020- 32:46.660* :  about how many weapons are delivered, how fast to Ukraine, how Ukraine may or may not use them,
*32:46.780- 32:53.040* :  for example. There are stresses and strains between Joe Biden and some of his allies over the
*32:53.040- 32:59.300* :  stance he's taken over the war in Gaza at the moment. And so today is a chance not only to show
*32:59.500- 33:04.680* :  respect to those veterans who've made it here today, and for those who lost their lives
*33:04.680- 33:10.720* :  80 years ago, and that includes, of course, civilians, 20,000 civilians lost their lives in the battle
*33:10.720- 33:18.020* :  of Normandy. But it also is a time of unity and a show of unity amongst these Allies with the
*33:18.020- 33:23.660* :  problems they're facing in the world today. Our Europe editor, Catcher Adler. Well, let's end this
*33:23.660- 33:28.780* :  podcast by listening to some of the music played at the events in Normandy. Here's the combined
*33:28.780- 33:31.840* :  bands of the Royal Air Force playing Elga's Nimrod.
*34:05.120- 34:09.720* :  And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This edition
*34:09.720- 34:14.840* :  was produced by Alice Adley and Mixed by Vladimir Mzeczka. The editors Karen Martin, I'm Oliver
*34:14.840- 34:16.480* :  Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
*34:28.620- 34:33.840* :  In one of the girlfriends, Bob's ex-girlfriends came together to bring him down and seek justice.
*34:34.060- 34:39.480* :  I can't believe this. Now on season two, host Carol Fisher is back, working to solve the mystery
*34:39.480- 34:44.780* :  of another missing woman. It's almost like it's become this moral obligation to find her.
*34:44.820- 34:49.340* :  Listen to the girlfriends, our lost sister, on America's number one podcast network, iHeart.
