*01:27.860- 01:33.760* :  I'm Janak Jalil and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 8th of June, an emotional reunion
*01:33.760- 01:38.220* :  24 years after a dramatic beach rescue. I just wanted to go back, you know,
*01:38.220- 01:43.460* :  visit Yuri. Like, this is my boy. He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Yuri.
*01:43.500- 01:50.640* :  It was one of the most important things I've ever done to succeed in saving two kids and
*01:50.640- 01:55.920* :  guarantee them a future. Catch of the day. I always wanted to search for treasure and I thought
*01:55.920- 02:00.860* :  you'd have to be wealthy with a ship and diving gear and tanks and all that. No, you need to find
*02:00.860- 02:06.600* :  treasure, your local pond. A couple in New York discover a safe full of cash using magnet fishing.
*02:07.520- 02:16.440* :  The amazing fossil found in Australia. Well, it's a pretty bulky bird, about 250 kilos in weight,
*02:16.540- 02:23.080* :  which makes it about five times the size of an EU. Also in this podcast,
*02:28.260- 02:31.040* :  the woman who's gone viral singing with her granddad.
*02:39.360- 02:45.580* :  The duo have even caught the attention of some big stars and the inspirational last words
*02:46.160- 02:50.260* :  of a British legend. My final message to you is whatever you're personal about.
*02:51.260- 02:55.140* :  It will be brave and face it. Every single day is precious.
*02:57.140- 02:58.100* :  Don't waste a moment.
*03:03.920- 03:08.780* :  We start with the heartwarming tale of a reunion. We often ask you to share your positive
*03:08.780- 03:14.320* :  and uplifting stories and one listener. Christian Helkevist from Sweden did just that.
*03:14.920- 03:20.400* :  Back in 2000, as a 13-year-old boy swimming off the coast of Terenje near the Italian city of
*03:20.400- 03:26.740* :  Pisa, he got into trouble in the water. Two lifeguards came to his rescue and saved him from drowning.
*03:27.600- 03:32.980* :  24 years later, Christian, who now works for the Red Cross, returned to the beach with his wife
*03:32.980- 03:38.200* :  and five-month-old son and found one of the men to whom he owed his life.
*03:39.040- 03:44.500* :  Yuri Bianchi. The two men told us their story, starting with Christian on what happened
*03:44.520- 03:49.020* :  after he and a friend decided to go for a swim, despite the high waves.
*03:49.900- 03:55.260* :  After a while, I realized that it was fairly difficult to get back to the beach.
*03:55.940- 03:59.640* :  In fact, I was rather being pulled out rather than closing in.
*04:00.220- 04:07.180* :  I soon realized that I would not make it. This is it. I am probably going to die.
*04:07.760- 04:15.060* :  So it was kind of a weird, very calm feeling in the beginning, but after a while, I did get help.
*04:18.380- 04:22.620* :  The first thing we did was try to rescue the closest child, the girl.
*04:23.240- 04:27.700* :  Then I saw Christian, who was with my colleague Guido, and I went to help them,
*04:28.460- 04:34.400* :  but the current was too strong. It took hold of the three of us and we spent 40 minutes
*04:35.120- 04:38.480* :  fighting the waves and the current to return to shore.
*04:39.360- 04:43.380* :  It made me emotional back then and still today, when I think about it.
*04:44.000- 04:48.040* :  It was one of the most important things I've ever done in my life
*04:48.900- 04:53.100* :  to succeed in saving two kids and guarantee them a future.
*04:54.960- 04:57.380* :  I'm getting emotional because it's so wonderful.
*04:58.260- 05:01.420* :  I think the feelings now are different from when I was 13.
*05:01.420- 05:06.420* :  When I was being rescued, then I realized, okay, this is really like I could see adults.
*05:06.420- 05:09.900* :  They struggle, but I felt at the time I was also very ashamed.
*05:10.320- 05:12.380* :  You know, like I did something stupid.
*05:16.860- 05:21.280* :  Adults should feel stupid, but not children. They're just playing around.
*05:22.320- 05:26.680* :  The experience with Christian and the girl fills me with so many emotions.
*05:27.220- 05:31.800* :  He'll always be welcoming my home and I know the same goes for me in Sweden.
*05:32.080- 05:35.360* :  Yuri came and visited in Sweden, which was awesome.
*05:35.580- 05:39.080* :  But me personally haven't been including Conte Viguri unfortunately.
*05:39.080- 05:42.660* :  That because I was ashamed, I didn't want to do it too much.
*05:42.740- 05:46.160* :  I wanted to leave the experience in the past.
*05:47.040- 05:51.320* :  Now, 24 years later, I've been thinking more and more about it and realize that this is
*05:51.900- 05:55.560* :  such a wonderful thing to happen, to get saved by Yuri and his colleague.
*05:55.560- 06:01.040* :  And I think becoming a father, I went back to Italy with my wife and my little boy.
*06:01.540- 06:03.920* :  And I just wanted to go back, you know, visit Yuri.
*06:03.920- 06:08.240* :  Like, this is my boy, he wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Yuri.
*06:08.400- 06:09.000* :  It's just amazing.
*06:15.580- 06:19.280* :  Even though I've not seen Christian for 24 years now,
*06:19.980- 06:23.000* :  he's always with me because he's part of my life.
*06:23.180- 06:29.820* :  I was young, I saved a child and going to Sweden to see the family afterwards was the most
*06:29.820- 06:37.060* :  beautiful journey of my life. I rescued many people, both as a lifeguard and a fireman.
*06:37.700- 06:39.060* :  But this is the one that stands out.
*06:39.680- 06:40.640* :  We established a bond.
*06:41.500- 06:45.120* :  And now we're back together after 24 years.
*06:46.100- 06:48.100* :  I didn't expect that much feeling.
*06:48.100- 06:50.500* :  I thought, yeah, I'm going to go there.
*06:50.500- 06:53.080* :  I'm going to say hello, that was it.
*06:53.160- 06:57.500* :  But we just started hugging, started laughing, see each other again.
*06:58.180- 07:02.420* :  And having my little baby with me, like, look at this little guy.
*07:02.800- 07:04.400* :  He's here now. I'm going to race him.
*07:04.400- 07:07.420* :  We're going to go to Banyu Coliff's often and he's going to swim here.
*07:07.540- 07:09.600* :  And we look out for him.
*07:09.640- 07:11.260* :  And I know that you will see.
*07:14.060- 07:15.960* :  It was a wonderful surprise.
*07:16.780- 07:20.200* :  It was so emotional seeing his baby and his family.
*07:21.000- 07:23.480* :  If all three of us had died in that rescue attempt,
*07:23.480- 07:27.260* :  three new families wouldn't have been formed.
*07:27.260- 07:30.740* :  Christian's mind and my colleague, Guido's.
*07:30.940- 07:32.040* :  That's exactly how I felt.
*07:32.040- 07:33.620* :  Like the ripple effects are controlling.
*07:33.620- 07:38.240* :  Like you really only saved me, saved my future family.
*07:38.240- 07:44.580* :  And the one thing that Yuri wrote on Banyu Coliff's Facebook site was that he's not a hero,
*07:44.580- 07:47.240* :  that he would do this again, and he would do it many times.
*07:48.020- 07:48.780* :  He is a hero.
*07:48.920- 07:52.060* :  They're doing this again, that's not only true, that he is.
*07:52.060- 07:54.540* :  It's, he's my hero, at least.
*07:54.800- 07:58.100* :  Thank you, Yuri, and we will not wait 24 more years.
*07:58.180- 07:59.480* :  We will see each other before that.
*08:00.540- 08:03.720* :  Christian and Yuri talking about their emotional reunion.
*08:05.000- 08:07.620* :  Many of us took up unusual hobbies during the pandemic,
*08:07.620- 08:12.260* :  but one New York couples lockdown project has also led them to unexpected riches.
*08:12.800- 08:14.880* :  As you may have heard in our Global News podcast,
*08:14.880- 08:19.900* :  they fished a safe, full of $100 bills out of a lake in Queens.
*08:20.720- 08:21.540* :  How do they do that?
*08:21.780- 08:27.040* :  By attaching an industrial strength magnet to a rope and using that to search for treasure.
*08:27.880- 08:30.780* :  This report from Isabella Jewel starts with a moment.
*08:30.780- 08:34.580* :  The couple realized they'd stumbled across something valuable.
*08:35.340- 08:38.940* :  I reached in with my hand, and I felt it right away.
*08:38.940- 08:41.240* :  And I was like, in my brain, I'm like, oh no, this can't be happening.
*08:41.240- 08:44.280* :  There's no way we just found like a whole bunch of dollar bills.
*08:44.400- 08:45.480* :  That's what I said in my head.
*08:45.620- 08:51.680* :  It was just a normal Friday when James Cain and Barbie Agostini were magnet fishing in a New York lake.
*08:55.240- 08:59.540* :  In the first hour of searching, they pulled up a large metal safe.
*08:59.980- 09:04.200* :  Not so unusual, but after feeling around inside the box,
*09:04.620- 09:07.160* :  they realized that unlike the ones they've found before,
*09:07.780- 09:10.220* :  this safe was stuffed full of cash.
*09:10.440- 09:13.500* :  Oh, it is stacks of bills, dude.
*09:13.500- 09:16.480* :  Oh, my God, hundreds more money.
*09:16.480- 09:19.180* :  When he first told me, he's like, oh, it's money.
*09:19.180- 09:20.580* :  It's, I'm like, no way.
*09:21.460- 09:22.000* :  No, it's not.
*09:22.300- 09:22.960* :  No, it's not.
*09:24.140- 09:28.700* :  Through the hole in the back, somehow there was this like jagged
*09:29.000- 09:31.520* :  hole that was only like a couple inches.
*09:31.780- 09:32.960* :  Yeah, a couple inches big.
*09:33.820- 09:38.420* :  He stuck his fingers in there, pulled it out, and you know, the rest was history.
*09:38.940- 09:43.420* :  Inside was an estimated $100,000 in $100 bills,
*09:44.280- 09:47.420* :  but it isn't a simple case of just taking the money to the bank.
*09:47.420- 09:50.520* :  The money is actually so waterlogged.
*09:50.740- 09:52.260* :  It is not usable at all.
*09:52.400- 09:54.520* :  The police, well, the NYPD over here are police.
*09:55.340- 09:56.580* :  They couldn't even take it in his evidence.
*09:56.580- 10:00.140* :  It's the size of money, but it's just like almost like a mushy pancake.
*10:00.640- 10:02.120* :  It's completely black covered in mud.
*10:02.120- 10:05.720* :  You're able to separate and look inside and you see the security strips.
*10:05.800- 10:07.480* :  Clearly, it's all $100 bills.
*10:07.880- 10:08.800* :  But all's not lost.
*10:08.800- 10:11.400* :  The couple were cleared by the police to keep the hall.
*10:11.820- 10:14.360* :  And luckily, there is a way to restore the money.
*10:14.700- 10:18.860* :  In Washington, DC, it's where they have our bureau of engraving and printing,
*10:18.860- 10:19.900* :  where they create the money.
*10:20.500- 10:22.280* :  We're going to hopefully bring it to them.
*10:23.060- 10:27.340* :  And it could take up to three years, but they will rebuild every single bill.
*10:27.700- 10:29.300* :  It takes a long time, free of charge.
*10:29.300- 10:33.520* :  And they will forensically find every serial number, even if it's in a shredder.
*10:33.740- 10:36.480* :  The American money will be rebuilt and they will cut me a check.
*10:36.780- 10:37.900* :  It's quite a find.
*10:38.000- 10:41.620* :  The sort of story that inspires magnet fishers across the world
*10:41.620- 10:44.340* :  to keep trawling rivers, canals and lakes.
*10:45.220- 10:49.620* :  If you look on YouTube, you can find hundreds of videos of enthusiasts pulling up weird
*10:49.620- 10:50.980* :  and wonderful objects.
*10:50.980- 10:53.080* :  They even hold competitions.
*10:53.080- 10:57.540* :  And next month, they'll celebrate International Magnet Fishing Day.
*10:58.000- 10:59.600* :  Let's go ahead and see what we can find here today.
*11:03.700- 11:05.360* :  First find, what do we got?
*11:05.360- 11:09.980* :  Oh, oh, oh, that's really hard.
*11:10.940- 11:14.300* :  I've been magnet fishing in the north of England with a couple of YouTubers,
*11:14.900- 11:16.800* :  and it's strangely addictive.
*11:17.700- 11:20.600* :  While most of what you pull up is rubbish every so often,
*11:20.600- 11:24.920* :  you find something truly special, as Mark and Lee told me.
*11:25.300- 11:25.940* :  Right, look at it.
*11:27.540- 11:28.640* :  That's a best way of explaining it.
*11:28.640- 11:29.440* :  It isn't sight look at it.
*11:29.540- 11:30.600* :  You never know what's going on.
*11:31.680- 11:33.540* :  First we underground where we found the catch box,
*11:33.900- 11:37.380* :  and inside the cheapest thing was worth 17 and a half thousand dollars.
*11:37.680- 11:38.260* :  What was it?
*11:42.080- 11:47.580* :  And that element of mystery is what drives James and Barbie back in New York to keep fishing.
*11:48.340- 11:52.000* :  But I always wanted to search for treasure, and I thought you'd have to be wealthy with a ship,
*11:52.000- 11:54.600* :  and diving gear, and tanks and all that.
*11:54.600- 11:57.020* :  No, you just need to find treasure, your local pond.
*11:57.020- 12:00.260* :  Barbie and I are going to magnet fish everything in New York City.
*12:00.600- 12:03.900* :  And I will leave nothing for anyone, because we're going to get it first.
*12:04.040- 12:07.940* :  We like to think about the stories of how it ended up in the water.
*12:08.180- 12:12.420* :  It's that that keeps us going with magnet fishing.
*12:13.020- 12:16.500* :  Barbie and James giving hope to treasure seekers everywhere.
*12:17.200- 12:20.860* :  Now, when you think of a goose, you're thinking of a bird that could fit into your oven,
*12:20.860- 12:28.360* :  but not this one, it stood at more than two and a half meters tall and weighed over 200 kilograms.
*12:28.360- 12:33.480* :  And according to researchers in Australia, it was the biggest goose that ever lived.
*12:33.480- 12:40.280* :  The scientists reached that conclusion after analysing the 45,000-year-old skull of a giant bird
*12:40.780- 12:44.000* :  found in Lake Calabona in the South Australian desert.
*12:44.700- 12:45.960* :  Alfie Haberson reports.
*12:50.720- 12:53.940* :  That's the slightly irritating squawk of a normal goose.
*12:54.320- 12:58.060* :  It's small and white with an orange beak reaching about up to your knee.
*12:58.600- 13:03.040* :  But it can be a bit unpredictable, because at any moment, without warning,
*13:03.040- 13:06.580* :  it can beat its wings and charge towards you on the attack.
*13:14.660- 13:16.640* :  But that's far from what we're talking about here.
*13:17.160- 13:21.000* :  Because this goose, whose skull has been found in the Southern Australian Outback,
*13:21.000- 13:25.420* :  is known as the Thunderbird or the Demon Duck.
*13:26.800- 13:30.780* :  They do sound like dramatic nicknames, so how scary can it really be?
*13:31.100- 13:34.320* :  Here's the lead scientist on the dick, Phoebe McKenerny.
*13:34.840- 13:39.300* :  Well, it's a pretty bulky bird, about 250 kilos in weight,
*13:40.000- 13:43.620* :  which makes it about five times the size of an amoeu,
*13:43.960- 13:49.160* :  and still much heavier than an ostrich as well, which is the largest bird to currently live.
*13:49.700- 13:53.640* :  So, in other words, it's about the same height as boxer Tyson Fury,
*13:54.160- 13:55.340* :  and heavier than a gorilla.
*13:56.160- 14:01.180* :  Maybe the only relief is that you will not be bumping into one on your next trip to Australia,
*14:01.780- 14:06.140* :  because it was alive 50,000 years ago, and was known as the Gay Neonis.
*14:06.800- 14:11.080* :  The discovery of its skull has revealed that it had a large helmet like head,
*14:11.800- 14:14.620* :  and sounds like it was probably top of the food chain.
*14:15.180- 14:19.820* :  Not much would have been able to take down genuineness.
*14:20.520- 14:27.380* :  We don't have pack animals as such in Australia, but there would have been things
*14:27.380- 14:33.460* :  such as giant crocodiles, and we have a giant lizard as well.
*14:33.660- 14:37.140* :  I suppose at least it wouldn't have eaten people or been able to fly,
*14:37.820- 14:41.200* :  but neither of those things have ever stopped to grisly bear from causing chaos,
*14:41.420- 14:45.180* :  so perhaps it's better that we've left the demon ducks in the past.
*14:49.540- 14:55.280* :  How's the Havish in there talking about the giant goose that perhaps happily is now extinct?
*14:56.220- 14:59.520* :  We heard about Christian and Yuri's amazing reunion earlier,
*14:59.520- 15:04.020* :  and we've also been asking for your stories of meeting people from your past in unexpected places.
*15:04.580- 15:08.380* :  Lots of you have been in touch, including Michelle from California in the US.
*15:09.060- 15:11.660* :  In 1988, my boyfriend and I traveled to Kenya.
*15:12.360- 15:15.120* :  We were one of about 25 tourists on Lamu Island,
*15:15.660- 15:18.360* :  which is in the northern part of the country near the Somali border.
*15:19.320- 15:21.720* :  After a day at the beach, we went to get a beer at Papones.
*15:22.300- 15:23.240* :  The bar was deserted.
*15:24.040- 15:25.740* :  All of a sudden, we heard someone say,
*15:26.260- 15:27.180* :  three tuskers, please.
*15:28.100- 15:30.780* :  My boyfriend looked at me and said, you're not going to believe this,
*15:31.000- 15:33.520* :  but that sounds like my fraternity brother, Dan Hacking.
*15:34.240- 15:36.980* :  We looked, and sure enough, it was Dan and his two sisters.
*15:38.080- 15:40.480* :  They were on a graduation trip, their father gave to them,
*15:40.540- 15:42.640* :  so they could see where they lived when they were young,
*15:42.760- 15:44.740* :  and he was a visiting professor in Uganda.
*15:46.000- 15:49.520* :  We spent the remainder of our time on Lamu together and had many adventures,
*15:50.140- 15:52.300* :  including finding the police canteen in the dark.
*15:53.060- 15:54.940* :  We've remained friends over the years.
*15:55.560- 15:57.460* :  If you're listening, Dan, Rachel and Jane,
*15:58.280- 16:00.480* :  we'd love to have a reunion with you on Lamu.
*16:01.940- 16:04.020* :  And you have a happy chance meeting to share,
*16:04.460- 16:05.700* :  or a story that's made you smile.
*16:06.060- 16:08.320* :  Please send us an email or a voice note,
*16:08.940- 16:12.820* :  globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*16:18.780- 16:21.340* :  Coming up in this podcast, harnessing nature
*16:21.340- 16:23.980* :  to clean Mexico City's polluted water.
*16:26.780- 16:28.100* :  This works as a filter.
*16:28.480- 16:30.340* :  We have gravel, volcanic rock,
*16:30.600- 16:31.700* :  and we have zeolites.
*16:31.900- 16:35.380* :  A mineral that will help improve water quality in each area.
*16:43.020- 16:43.740* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*16:43.740- 16:47.680* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:47.940- 16:50.360* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*16:50.680- 16:54.280* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*16:54.320- 16:58.080* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:58.380- 17:01.580* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month
*17:01.580- 17:03.400* :  to just $15 a month.

*17:50.760- 17:54.660* :  Now, have you ever imagined yourself becoming an international star
*17:54.660- 17:56.300* :  while singing at home in the shower?
*17:56.900- 17:59.100* :  For most of us, it's just a nice daydream,
*17:59.460- 18:02.600* :  but let's hear from two people who actually have the voices
*18:02.600- 18:04.900* :  to turn that dream into reality.
*18:05.460- 18:09.120* :  25-year-old Yazzie Chamberlain has gone viral on social media
*18:09.120- 18:11.920* :  with videos of her singing duets of classic hits
*18:12.240- 18:15.160* :  with her 87-year-old granddad, John Tucker,
*18:15.640- 18:17.540* :  and lots of people have been commenting
*18:17.540- 18:21.040* :  on how deeply touched they are by the connection between the two.
*18:21.740- 18:23.740* :  And the duo have even caught the attention
*18:23.740- 18:25.840* :  of one of the world's biggest rock bands,
*18:25.880- 18:30.280* :  Coldplay. Yazzie and John have been chatting to Alfie Haberson.
*18:41.260- 18:44.160* :  I've always geeked a lot, and my granddad used to take me
*18:44.160- 18:45.020* :  to my singing lessons.
*18:45.720- 18:48.240* :  And I never knew that he had this amazing voice
*18:48.280- 18:50.960* :  until one day I was doing one of my own gigs,
*18:51.240- 18:53.240* :  and I could hear someone in the audience joining in,
*18:53.280- 18:55.660* :  and I was trying to scan the room to figure out
*18:55.660- 18:58.020* :  who it was that had this amazing low voice.
*18:58.660- 19:00.800* :  And then I realized it was my granddad joining in,
*19:01.180- 19:03.040* :  and then I uploaded a video with my granddad
*19:03.660- 19:05.360* :  and everyone just styled in love with him.
*19:05.500- 19:11.260* :  The drums, the stenderies.
*19:12.480- 19:14.400* :  And your voices go so well together.
*19:14.700- 19:16.480* :  I mean, you have that really powerful voice,
*19:16.520- 19:18.420* :  but then John comes in with this booming,
*19:19.080- 19:20.220* :  and it's really spectacular.
*19:20.220- 19:23.140* :  John, I know it's not the first time that you've sung.
*19:23.660- 19:24.780* :  Not the first time, no.
*19:25.220- 19:26.740* :  No, no, that's always sung.
*19:27.460- 19:28.360* :  You know, it inquires.
*19:29.040- 19:31.980* :  Then with my friend, John Hobbs at the Bug Coral,
*19:32.660- 19:35.260* :  and the highlight, of course, was singing with 600
*19:35.880- 19:39.100* :  Cornish voices at a Royal Albert Hall about 10 years ago.
*19:39.440- 19:42.200* :  How is it to see your granddaughter getting into singing as well?
*19:42.940- 19:44.480* :  It just seems so natural.
*19:44.480- 19:48.400* :  I just feel like she's so good.
*19:48.400- 19:49.520* :  I'm so proud of her.
*19:50.000- 19:52.820* :  I think she ought to be at the top, like some of the...
*19:54.660- 19:55.400* :  The big stars.
*19:55.560- 19:57.340* :  Some of the big stars, yes I do.
*20:00.240- 20:01.660* :  I came along.
*20:03.060- 20:04.540* :  Well, I'm not sure it would be too long now,
*20:04.540- 20:07.820* :  because talking of which, some big stars
*20:07.820- 20:09.660* :  have been in contact, haven't they?
*20:09.960- 20:13.900* :  I took my grandma and my granddad along to one of my gigs in Budes,
*20:14.200- 20:16.460* :  so I took grandads and grandmas to the beach,
*20:17.200- 20:19.500* :  and I came back and I looked on my phone,
*20:19.840- 20:23.180* :  and I saw Col play had left a comment on the video.
*20:24.280- 20:26.120* :  Automatically, I was freaking out.
*20:26.500- 20:28.280* :  I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
*20:28.480- 20:29.780* :  You're skin,
*20:31.080- 20:33.480* :  although you're skin rose,
*20:34.020- 20:38.620* :  turning to something beautiful.
*20:40.140- 20:42.380* :  I think it's absolutely amazing all these people commenting,
*20:42.380- 20:45.080* :  but I think grandad does think it's amazing,
*20:45.260- 20:47.080* :  but I think the main thing of it is,
*20:47.080- 20:50.220* :  is I think really he just loves spending time with me and singing.
*20:50.940- 20:52.180* :  When I sing with grandad,
*20:52.180- 20:54.980* :  I've had to really train myself to not cry,
*20:55.700- 21:00.720* :  and I have to also remember that it's not necessarily a sad thing,
*21:00.720- 21:02.560* :  even though sometimes you can feel really sad
*21:02.560- 21:04.040* :  seeing your grandparents get older,
*21:04.040- 21:06.880* :  and I do feel sad about that all the time.
*21:08.380- 21:12.520* :  But what I try and do is live in the moment with my granddad.
*21:20.860- 21:23.460* :  And just make sure that he is enjoying his life.
*21:23.660- 21:27.220* :  I think the message that I give is a little reminder to people
*21:27.440- 21:29.780* :  to go and pop in and have a cup of tea with their grandparents,
*21:29.780- 21:31.760* :  and that's really special to me.
*21:36.660- 21:37.800* :  You see, that's how I imagine,
*21:38.100- 21:39.220* :  you know, when I try and sing in the show,
*21:39.220- 21:40.200* :  that's how I imagine it.
*21:40.320- 21:42.140* :  It comes out, but it certainly doesn't.
*21:42.140- 21:42.540* :  I'm sure you do.
*21:43.540- 21:45.520* :  One thing that I just wanted to ask before I let you go,
*21:45.820- 21:48.900* :  is just what do you think makes for a long and happy life?
*21:49.320- 21:53.140* :  Well, singing from me and having a family nearby.
*21:53.920- 21:57.360* :  And for me, I feel like music and love and family,
*21:57.900- 22:00.680* :  and also stop stressing and just enjoy yourself.
*22:19.460- 22:24.880* :  And stand by me, stand by me.
*22:26.940- 22:29.120* :  Yazzie Chamberlain and her granddad,
*22:29.120- 22:32.980* :  John Tucker, singing and talking to Alfie Habeson.
*22:34.180- 22:36.620* :  Now, for a couple of quick stories, we spotted this week.
*22:36.980- 22:40.360* :  Three Andy and Bear Cubs have gone outside for the first time
*22:40.360- 22:44.300* :  at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Queen Zoo in New York City.
*22:44.900- 22:47.280* :  The five-month-old Cubs have been seen running,
*22:47.280- 22:52.240* :  jumping and climbing trees under the watchful eye of their mother, Nicole.
*22:53.060- 22:54.340* :  These type of bears are rare,
*22:54.540- 22:58.960* :  and typically, Andy and Bears give birth to one or two Cubs at a time.
*22:59.880- 23:04.100* :  And initially, more than 13,000 people have gathered in Verona
*23:04.100- 23:09.320* :  to market Talian Opera's addition to UNESCO's list of intangible global heritage.
*23:10.020- 23:14.560* :  Performing were 300 choristers, an orchestra of 150 musicians,
*23:15.120- 23:19.280* :  and a selection of the world's finest opera singers performing the greats.
*23:34.140- 23:37.420* :  To Mexico now, an scheme that's harnessing the powers of nature
*23:37.420- 23:39.160* :  to help clean polluted water.
*23:39.780- 23:42.040* :  Mexico City often floods in the rainy season,
*23:42.040- 23:45.720* :  but at the same time is running out of clean, usable water
*23:45.720- 23:50.120* :  for the more than 22 million people who live in the metropolitan area.
*23:50.820- 23:52.760* :  One project designed to help solve the crisis
*23:52.760- 23:56.360* :  involves the creation of 12 wetlands around the city,
*23:56.940- 24:01.560* :  and it's hoped they'll eventually be able to filter 14 litres of water
*24:01.560- 24:06.500* :  a second for using cleaning, sanitation, and possibly even for drinking.
*24:07.480- 24:10.460* :  Craig Langeron took a cable car ride to one of the new wetlands
*24:10.500- 24:13.440* :  with the man behind the idea, Alejandro Alvar.
*24:15.940- 24:19.440* :  We're high above the houses, heading for the suburb of Cuautapec,
*24:19.700- 24:22.460* :  which clings to one of the mountains that ring Mexico City.
*24:24.820- 24:27.220* :  Now you're going to solve the wetland there.
*24:27.280- 24:28.360* :  Now it's a built-down.
*24:28.500- 24:31.080* :  Oh wow, yeah, so in the background there are two big mountains,
*24:31.520- 24:33.480* :  and then lots and lots of houses for us.
*24:33.620- 24:34.660* :  As far as the eye can see, really.
*24:35.000- 24:39.140* :  And then, yeah, just literally right down here below Austin Slyley to the left,
*24:39.400- 24:41.700* :  I can see a large body of water.
*24:43.700- 24:45.800* :  We're stuck now, around the Zeki.
*24:45.940- 24:46.820* :  Straight, let's go.
*24:50.340- 24:54.020* :  Alejandro is a biologist and a professor at a local university,
*24:54.740- 24:58.600* :  and he's built this wetland in order to clean Cuautapec's dirty water.
*25:00.220- 25:03.680* :  So we're just standing on a bridge over a river.
*25:03.880- 25:06.800* :  I'll tell you around, I can see the river flowing down from the mountain side.
*25:07.260- 25:11.180* :  The water's a muddy brown color, and you can smell the sewage, actually,
*25:11.180- 25:13.100* :  that smoke isn't great at all.
*25:14.160- 25:19.700* :  As the river winds down the mountain, sewage and industrial waste is often emptied into it,
*25:19.940- 25:22.120* :  we're standing at the point where the river enters the wetland,
*25:22.120- 25:26.000* :  which just months ago was a stagnant, lifeless swamp.
*25:29.980- 25:33.640* :  It was full of lilies, but smelly, with dead animals,
*25:33.640- 25:35.020* :  rubbish everywhere.
*25:35.740- 25:38.940* :  It was an open air dump where people threw everything.
*25:39.540- 25:44.060* :  Alejandro's big idea is using the soil, plants, and microorganisms
*25:44.060- 25:46.840* :  to treat the wastewater flowing in from the river,
*25:47.440- 25:50.220* :  as well as creating a thriving habitat for wildlife.
*25:51.880- 25:57.120* :  But first, he had to clean and drain the swamp before carefully selecting which plants to use.
*25:58.080- 26:02.720* :  Alejandro's divided the wetland, which is about the size of two large football pitches,
*26:03.020- 26:06.140* :  into several rectangular sections, separated by top all in.
*26:06.820- 26:14.700* :  There are 15 or 20 man-made beds, which each look like a flower bed,
*26:14.920- 26:19.860* :  and in each of those beds, you can see different rocks and plants.
*26:22.900- 26:27.520* :  Each of these works as a filter, and each has different properties that will help
*26:27.520- 26:29.940* :  improve water quality, step-by-step.
*26:31.140- 26:36.440* :  We have gravel, volcanic rock, and we have zeolites, which are a mineral,
*26:37.080- 26:39.700* :  that will help improve water quality in each area.
*26:40.720- 26:43.680* :  This combination of the soil, rocks, and plants,
*26:43.680- 26:46.920* :  work in tandem as a sort of biological filter,
*26:47.460- 26:50.500* :  and together they provide a home for microorganisms,
*26:50.560- 26:55.500* :  good bacteria, which are able to break down and remove pollutants from the water.
*26:56.340- 26:59.260* :  The wetlands also become a magnet for the local wildlife.
*26:59.260- 27:03.540* :  I can see a huge flock of birds flying above the water,
*27:04.140- 27:05.620* :  chorritos, veras de gallo, playeros.
*27:06.420- 27:09.620* :  What happens is that flowers, in this case, shorebirds.
*27:10.660- 27:14.060* :  They are capable of feeding on small microorganisms in the water.
*27:15.180- 27:17.180* :  We also have some herons that come here.
*27:19.020- 27:24.100* :  Biologist Professor Alejandro Alva, ending that report by Craig Langren,
*27:24.480- 27:28.820* :  on a groundbreaking project to clean polluted water in Mexico.
*27:31.420- 27:33.140* :  And that's nearly it from us, but not quite.
*27:33.140- 27:36.680* :  Before our final item, there's just time to say we'd love to hear
*27:36.680- 27:39.240* :  if you have any stories to share that will make us all smile.
