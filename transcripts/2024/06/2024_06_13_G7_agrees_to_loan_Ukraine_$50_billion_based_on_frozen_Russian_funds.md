*00:53.160- 00:58.080* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising
*00:58.080- 01:03.260* :  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*01:25.900- 01:30.540* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Friday the 14th of June. These are our main stories.
*01:30.540- 01:36.780* :  G7 leaders agree a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using profits from seized Russian assets.
*01:36.860- 01:42.400* :  The US Supreme Court rejects an attempt to restrict access to a widely used abortion drug,
*01:42.940- 01:48.060* :  and we hear how hard pilgrims traveling to Mecca are getting scammed by fake companies.
*01:50.280- 01:51.160* :  Also in this podcast?
*01:53.560- 01:59.520* :  A tentative step out of a shipping crate. A man named Tessa, the first of her kind to
*01:59.600- 02:02.300* :  set foot in Kazakhstan for two centuries.
*02:04.920- 02:09.560* :  Conservationists are returning endangered wild horses to the golden step of Kazakhstan,
*02:09.740- 02:13.200* :  and the postman who created a surprise football anthem.
*02:17.120- 02:21.100* :  Let's begin with the war in Ukraine, and specifically Western efforts to help the country
*02:21.100- 02:25.820* :  defend itself against Russia. President Vladimir Zelensky has proven very effective
*02:25.820- 02:29.780* :  of asking the most powerful leaders in the world for support and getting it.
*02:30.180- 02:34.560* :  At the G7 meeting of seven of the world's richest nations in Italy, he's done that again.
*02:34.560- 02:40.160* :  They agreed a $50 billion loan plan using the interest made by frozen Russian assets.
*02:40.160- 02:44.220* :  He also signed a 10-year security agreement with President Biden.
*02:44.740- 02:51.060* :  Today is a true limb historic day, and we have signed the strongest agreement within
*02:51.880- 02:57.060* :  Ukraine and the US since our independence.
*02:57.600- 03:01.500* :  President Zelensky, this was President Biden speaking at the same news conference.
*03:02.140- 03:07.860* :  A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself now,
*03:07.900- 03:11.900* :  and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.
*03:12.380- 03:16.380* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale has been telling me exactly what's been agreed.
*03:17.040- 03:23.980* :  The G7 leaders have agreed politically that it's right for them to use all those Russian assets
*03:23.980- 03:30.960* :  that were frozen after the invasion of Ukraine back in 2022 to try and raise money for Ukraine.
*03:31.520- 03:36.460* :  There's a lot of money. It's about $300 billion, and it's sitting in various spots,
*03:36.460- 03:39.320* :  mostly in Belgium, mostly in the European Union.
*03:39.720- 03:43.140* :  It's earning about $3 billion a year in interest.
*03:43.140- 03:46.660* :  There's just sort of sitting there, and essentially leaders said,
*03:46.660- 03:47.620* :  we should use that money.
*03:47.660- 03:49.760* :  Now, they could just spend it to sort of give it to Ukraine,
*03:49.860- 03:54.060* :  but they thought that $3 billion a year for Ukraine won't actually touch the sides.
*03:54.540- 04:00.160* :  So what they're going to do is they're going to try and raise a loan on the international money markets,
*04:01.080- 04:07.020* :  and use the $3 billion they get each year to pay off that loan.
*04:07.120- 04:09.160* :  It's a bit like an interest-only mortgage.
*04:09.540- 04:11.800* :  Now, the problem is that that sounds quite reasonable.
*04:12.060- 04:15.280* :  Actually, there's a lot of detail still to be worked out,
*04:15.280- 04:20.000* :  such as who precisely will raise the loan and when,
*04:20.000- 04:25.020* :  and who will share the debt and the risk when it comes into fruition.
*04:25.080- 04:26.460* :  So it's a political agreement.
*04:26.960- 04:28.300* :  The details are still going to be worked out.
*04:28.600- 04:29.720* :  Let's talk about the choreography.
*04:29.800- 04:33.940* :  President Zelensky, President Biden, standing alongside each other,
*04:33.940- 04:36.820* :  surrounded by U.S. and Ukrainian flags,
*04:36.820- 04:39.180* :  has obvious benefits for Ukraine.
*04:39.400- 04:42.660* :  I suspect some benefits for Joe Biden as well at home
*04:42.660- 04:44.200* :  through the prism of the U.S. election.
*04:44.820- 04:47.880* :  Look, almost all of these leaders at the G7
*04:47.880- 04:50.060* :  are facing electoral challenges.
*04:50.440- 04:51.900* :  Probably only the host,
*04:52.440- 04:54.580* :  George and Maloney, the Italian Prime Minister,
*04:55.180- 04:58.600* :  is actually at the moment coming out of electoral success
*04:58.600- 04:59.440* :  in the European Parliament.
*05:00.040- 05:02.240* :  So I think there's a sense of just saying,
*05:02.240- 05:04.680* :  look, we're expecting there's going to be change.
*05:04.780- 05:07.400* :  So let's make some changes now that are going to last
*05:07.400- 05:08.860* :  longer than some of those elections.
*05:09.520- 05:12.040* :  Whether it helps at home, that's a more moot point.
*05:12.860- 05:14.820* :  And also, could it be on-peak,
*05:14.820- 05:17.320* :  if you end up with Donald Trump in the White House sale
*05:17.320- 05:21.020* :  or some of the other faces around the G7 table changing?
*05:21.460- 05:23.660* :  Could what's been agreed today be on-done?
*05:24.720- 05:25.880* :  Well, they hope it won't.
*05:25.880- 05:28.760* :  What they're trying to do is to lock it in
*05:29.300- 05:32.080* :  so that it's sort of Trump proof, if you like,
*05:32.080- 05:34.940* :  to use that phrase at some analysts here have been using.
*05:35.620- 05:39.340* :  Essentially, say, look, get the money to Ukraine as quickly as possible.
*05:39.600- 05:42.220* :  Do this deal before the Americans start coming up
*05:42.220- 05:44.500* :  against the blocks of their election.
*05:45.060- 05:46.800* :  But I think the difficulty they've got now is
*05:46.800- 05:50.760* :  a lot of those details now about how much Europe should bear the risk,
*05:50.780- 05:52.340* :  how much the United States should bear the risk.
*05:53.000- 05:55.200* :  That's the risk, is that gets caught up in the
*05:55.200- 05:56.880* :  intellectual process in the United States
*05:57.520- 05:59.700* :  and the cash doesn't end up getting to Ukraine.
*05:59.700- 06:01.040* :  It needs to get there fast,
*06:01.040- 06:03.820* :  and there's still quite a lot of detail to be worked out.
*06:03.980- 06:07.520* :  Vladimir Zelensky is an absolute expert at these negotiations.
*06:08.040- 06:09.280* :  And what he always does is goes,
*06:09.280- 06:11.160* :  thank you very much indeed for the $50 billion
*06:11.880- 06:13.220* :  and now I'd like something else.
*06:13.280- 06:14.540* :  What's the something else this time?
*06:15.140- 06:16.820* :  Shells, shells, shells,
*06:17.520- 06:19.660* :  ed offenses, ed offenses, ed offenses.
*06:19.660- 06:20.940* :  That's what he needs right now.
*06:21.560- 06:23.620* :  In a news conference he gave with President Biden,
*06:24.080- 06:27.820* :  he said, we need seven Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems.
*06:28.540- 06:32.680* :  We simply don't have enough a huge amount of Ukraine's energy infrastructure
*06:32.680- 06:36.260* :  has been destroyed in the recent attacks by Russia,
*06:36.800- 06:40.440* :  people in Ukraine having to live with quite a few power outages at the moment.
*06:41.080- 06:43.360* :  So that's what he needs and he needs it fast.
*06:43.360- 06:47.160* :  And it's all well and good to have money to help with
*06:47.560- 06:48.240* :  reconstruction and things like that.
*06:48.240- 06:50.840* :  But what he actually needs right now is, as he always says,
*06:50.840- 06:51.780* :  shells and ed offenses.
*06:52.380- 06:53.760* :  Some are beginning to get to him,
*06:53.800- 06:55.620* :  but it's still taking longer than he would want.
*06:56.240- 06:58.380* :  Our diplomatic correspondent, James Lander,
*06:58.380- 06:59.760* :  with me from Southern Italy.
*07:00.520- 07:02.860* :  In a victory for abortion rights activists,
*07:03.040- 07:06.820* :  US Supreme Court justices have unanimously upheld the right
*07:06.820- 07:09.140* :  to use a widely available abortion pill.
*07:09.140- 07:13.300* :  It's one of two drugs commonly used for terminating pregnancies in the US.
*07:13.980- 07:16.740* :  A group of anti-abortion organizations had brought the case
*07:16.740- 07:19.980* :  in an attempt to unravel the food and drug administrations approval
*07:19.980- 07:20.820* :  of this drug.
*07:21.160- 07:23.660* :  Michelle Hendrickson from Students for Life of America
*07:23.660- 07:25.020* :  was outside the court.
*07:25.340- 07:27.440* :  She said they'd try again to push for a ban.
*07:27.800- 07:29.220* :  This is absolutely not the end of the road.
*07:29.220- 07:30.920* :  We do believe that we'll be back in the court.
*07:30.920- 07:33.280* :  There are women all over the country
*07:33.280- 07:33.900* :  with standing.
*07:34.600- 07:35.740* :  We can come forward now.
*07:35.740- 07:37.320* :  This is just that first step.
*07:37.320- 07:39.860* :  The door has been opened to have this conversation.
*07:39.860- 07:41.860* :  More cases are going to come up and we'll think.
*07:42.440- 07:44.540* :  Abortion rights groups have welcomed the decision,
*07:44.640- 07:46.100* :  but warn there are many other attempts
*07:46.100- 07:48.160* :  to limit abortion access in the US.
*07:48.740- 07:52.360* :  Jacqueline Ares from Planned Parenthood says the fight isn't over.
*07:52.720- 07:54.700* :  Abortion is on the ballot.
*07:54.700- 07:58.680* :  The presidential race in the United States this year
*07:59.160- 08:03.160* :  will absolutely be a debate over whether or not a candidate
*08:03.840- 08:06.620* :  supports people's ability to make their personal decisions
*08:06.620- 08:08.300* :  and respect bodily autonomy.
*08:08.780- 08:10.520* :  President Biden welcomed the decision,
*08:10.520- 08:13.920* :  but said it didn't change the fact that women lost a fundamental freedom
*08:14.420- 08:17.620* :  when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago.
*08:18.140- 08:20.980* :  An ortho-america correspondent Nomea Ikpal told me more
*08:20.980- 08:22.140* :  about this latest ruling.
*08:22.560- 08:24.740* :  Well, this was a challenge to the drug mythopristo
*08:24.740- 08:27.220* :  and it's using a majority of abortions in combination
*08:27.220- 08:28.280* :  with another drug.
*08:28.820- 08:32.200* :  The FDA made it more accessible in 2016 and 2021
*08:32.200- 08:34.280* :  such as you can take it later in pregnancy,
*08:34.280- 08:38.320* :  most women who have abortions take it up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.
*08:39.260- 08:41.620* :  It also allows more health workers to prescribe it
*08:41.780- 08:43.080* :  and to receive it in the post.
*08:44.160- 08:46.900* :  So you have this group of anti-abortion doctors
*08:46.900- 08:49.680* :  and anti-abortion organizations who do not believe
*08:49.680- 08:51.680* :  that the drug should have federal approval.
*08:52.120- 08:55.460* :  That's really important to state that Supreme Court's unanimous decision
*08:55.660- 08:56.580* :  or nine justices,
*08:57.180- 09:00.220* :  they weren't taking a position on its safety or morality.
*09:00.220- 09:05.520* :  Instead, the court basically said that the challenges had no legal standing
*09:05.520- 09:09.800* :  to bring the case because whilst they may have moral,
*09:09.800- 09:13.260* :  legal and ideological objections,
*09:13.260- 09:17.680* :  they have not suffered direct and concrete injuries in order to sue
*09:17.680- 09:20.260* :  because none of them use it, none of them prescribe it.
*09:20.820- 09:23.600* :  And Justice Kavanaugh, one of the conservative justices,
*09:24.260- 09:27.700* :  quoted the standing doctrine, this legal standing doctrine,
*09:27.700- 09:32.520* :  which was sort of succinctly summarised by Justice Scalia
*09:32.520- 09:35.580* :  who died in 2016, which basically requires plaintiffs
*09:35.620- 09:38.840* :  to answer the question, what is it to you?
*09:39.720- 09:40.920* :  And the plaintiffs in this case
*09:41.000- 09:43.900* :  didn't really have any good answer to that question.
*09:44.820- 09:46.180* :  And so it's important to state,
*09:46.180- 09:48.020* :  this isn't the justices suddenly deciding
*09:48.020- 09:51.140* :  that Mr Pristone is fine to use or anything like that.
*09:51.140- 09:52.580* :  They're just saying that it doesn't,
*09:53.380- 09:55.140* :  it doesn't have the legal standing,
*09:55.140- 09:57.100* :  so they can't look at the merits of the case.
*09:57.100- 09:59.100* :  Nor does the ruling change the fact
*09:59.740- 10:01.760* :  that medication abortion is still illegal
*10:01.760- 10:05.560* :  in the 14 states with near-total bans on abortion
*10:05.640- 10:08.340* :  and that's whether it's done by a procedure or a pill.
*10:08.660- 10:11.240* :  I was in Washington covering a US election 20 years ago
*10:11.240- 10:14.660* :  and I couldn't believe the extent to which this issue of abortion
*10:15.300- 10:18.280* :  is part of the daily political discourse in the US.
*10:18.280- 10:20.140* :  It still is now, obviously. Why?
*10:21.280- 10:22.740* :  It still is. And it has been for decades.
*10:22.740- 10:25.220* :  It's important to say that anti-abortion activists
*10:25.980- 10:30.540* :  have been for decades trying to make abortion illegal
*10:30.540- 10:34.140* :  when Roe v. Wade was introduced in the 70s.
*10:34.580- 10:36.560* :  You know, since then it never really had any peace.
*10:36.560- 10:40.200* :  There was always attempts to whittle away
*10:40.200- 10:41.380* :  at the constitutional right.
*10:41.380- 10:45.020* :  And ever since Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago,
*10:45.100- 10:47.760* :  it has been come such a potent issue.
*10:48.520- 10:50.600* :  And this, I would say, this ruling
*10:50.600- 10:53.780* :  is allowed Republicans to dodge a potentially toxic issue
*10:53.780- 10:56.280* :  in the midst of a tight presidential race.
*10:56.280- 10:59.960* :  Democrats have seen that, you know, publicly,
*10:59.980- 11:03.220* :  most people still believe in the constitutional right
*11:03.220- 11:05.060* :  to an abortion and the majority of Americans
*11:05.060- 11:07.220* :  still support access to medicated abortion.
*11:07.320- 11:08.760* :  So it's still very much an issue,
*11:08.760- 11:11.680* :  as we head into the November presidential election.
*11:11.960- 11:13.460* :  Not me, Akbar, with me from Washington.
*11:14.240- 11:16.540* :  Russian prosecutors say the American journalist,
*11:16.540- 11:19.440* :  Evan Gershkiewicz, will go on trial for espionage.
*11:19.760- 11:21.000* :  No date has been given.
*11:21.460- 11:24.680* :  Mr. Gershkiewicz was reporting for the Wall Street Journal last year
*11:24.680- 11:25.580* :  when he was arrested.
*11:26.040- 11:28.100* :  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, has more.
*11:28.660- 11:31.600* :  Evan Gershkiewicz has been in pretrial detention in Moscow
*11:31.900- 11:33.000* :  for more than 14 months.
*11:33.880- 11:36.860* :  Now prosecutors have announced that his case will go to trial
*11:36.860- 11:40.720* :  a thousand miles away in Yekaterinburg, where he was arrested.
*11:41.460- 11:44.380* :  They claim that the US journalist was working for the CIA
*11:44.920- 11:47.460* :  and collecting information about a Russian tank factory.
*11:48.100- 11:51.180* :  Mr. Gershkiewicz, his employer, and the US government
*11:51.460- 11:52.880* :  fiercely reject the charge.
*11:53.700- 11:56.380* :  The Wall Street Journal has previously accused Moscow
*11:56.720- 11:59.360* :  of stockpiling Americans in Russian jails,
*11:59.760- 12:01.600* :  so as to trade them at a later date.
*12:02.320- 12:05.980* :  And Russian officials barely hide the fact that they see Evan Gershkiewicz
*12:06.200- 12:07.160* :  as a bargaining chip.
*12:07.880- 12:11.680* :  Referring to efforts by the White House to secure Mr. Gershkiewicz's release,
*12:12.240- 12:14.920* :  last week President Putin said that such questions
*12:15.520- 12:18.140* :  require dialogue between intelligence agencies
*12:18.760- 12:21.720* :  and should be resolved only on the basis of reciprocity.
*12:22.480- 12:25.340* :  In other words, Russia wants someone in return.
*12:26.160- 12:29.900* :  And that someone is thought to be FSB security service officer
*12:30.280- 12:34.500* :  Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence for murder in Germany.
*12:35.620- 12:38.460* :  Every year, huge numbers of Muslims from around the world
*12:38.460- 12:42.220* :  gather in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to perform the hard ritual.
*12:42.820- 12:45.200* :  Many pilgrims choose to travel with tour companies,
*12:45.200- 12:47.040* :  but the number of people getting scammed
*12:47.040- 12:49.940* :  is causing increasing concern for the Saudi authorities
*12:50.380- 12:53.560* :  with many people being targeted by false social media ads
*12:53.940- 12:55.480* :  or being given fake permits.
*12:55.480- 12:58.740* :  For more on this, Elabik Maul has been talking to Ethar Shalabi
*12:58.740- 12:59.740* :  from BBC Arabic.
*13:05.400- 13:09.800* :  The Hodge is a pilgrimage, almost limbs are expected to make once in their lifetime,
*13:09.800- 13:11.120* :  if they are able.
*13:11.620- 13:14.120* :  As the fifth pillar of Islam, it's a rite of passage.
*13:14.860- 13:18.900* :  However, an increasing number of pilgrims are experiencing their worst nightmare,
*13:19.360- 13:23.400* :  being refused entry to holy sites for unknowingly buying a fake permit.
*13:23.940- 13:25.640* :  It does cost a lot of money,
*13:25.660- 13:31.860* :  and many people would be saving four years and years to be able to avoid a journey as such.
*13:32.260- 13:35.900* :  Ethar Shalabi is a senior journalist from the BBC's Arabic service.
*13:35.900- 13:39.960* :  She says the most common scams are advertised on social media.
*13:40.340- 13:44.700* :  So people can easily fall trap of the last minute Hodge package
*13:45.340- 13:49.580* :  with very attractive prices through tour operators online,
*13:49.820- 13:51.860* :  whom they haven't really verified.
*13:52.640- 13:55.580* :  Some people fall in the trap of Google reviews,
*13:55.900- 13:58.320* :  and most reviews are actually fake.
*13:58.840- 14:02.900* :  One of the people I've spoken with told me that he knows of companies
*14:03.380- 14:08.180* :  who would be paying people loads of money to be writing fake reviews online.
*14:08.660- 14:12.320* :  Another man, Ethar, interviewed spent $2,000 on his permit.
*14:12.320- 14:17.520* :  It wasn't until he arrived in Mecca that authorities told him the barcode was forged.
*14:17.700- 14:20.780* :  When I was speaking with him over the phone, the guy was almost crying.
*14:20.780- 14:23.780* :  He kept telling me, I lost my hedge and my money as well.
*14:24.240- 14:26.200* :  I lost both, and I am in Mecca.
*14:26.200- 14:31.080* :  Like, Kaba is just a few meters away from me, and I can't perform hedge.
*14:31.440- 14:33.620* :  And he was wearing the hedge clothes and everything.
*14:33.620- 14:37.720* :  So blessed, and he was really in a heart-broken state.
*14:38.260- 14:41.960* :  So far, he's had no response from the company, which sold him the permit.
*14:42.440- 14:45.920* :  He could not receive any emails or any responses,
*14:45.920- 14:50.580* :  and even the representative was not responding to any of his calls.
*14:51.040- 14:53.340* :  So he's staying now in a kind of a limbo,
*14:53.720- 14:56.840* :  not being able to perform hedge while he's actually in Mecca,
*14:57.340- 14:59.060* :  and have lost already around $2,000.
*14:59.900- 15:02.540* :  If it all made that in recent years, the Saudi authorities
*15:02.540- 15:05.260* :  have introduced new rules to regulate permits.
*15:05.260- 15:08.940* :  If you are in Europe, the Americas, or in Australia,
*15:09.420- 15:11.720* :  you have to go through the Nusuk platform,
*15:11.720- 15:14.260* :  and that is an official Saudi platform
*15:14.260- 15:16.700* :  to be able to receive their hedge permits.
*15:17.400- 15:20.440* :  If you are in any other Arab country or Muslim country,
*15:20.440- 15:25.360* :  you have to go through the official hedge boroughs in your country,
*15:25.360- 15:28.020* :  in the government, that basically lays with the government,
*15:28.020- 15:32.900* :  with the Saudi authorities, do not ever rely on online reviews,
*15:33.720- 15:35.080* :  social media advertisements,
*15:35.900- 15:39.500* :  simply anyone who is not through an official entity.
*15:39.940- 15:42.660* :  Is estimated more than 1.8 million people
*15:42.660- 15:44.920* :  will be making their way to Mecca from Friday
*15:45.460- 15:46.980* :  for the start of the hard period.
*15:47.520- 15:49.380* :  90% of them coming from abroad.
*15:50.020- 15:52.780* :  The Saudi Ministry responsible for the hard told the BBC
*15:52.780- 15:57.400* :  that its new SAP platform has significantly reduced cases off-road.
*15:57.800- 15:59.260* :  That will be good news for many,
*15:59.260- 16:03.440* :  and that's because the hard pilgrimage remains a spiritual highlight for Muslims,
*16:03.440- 16:07.460* :  and often has a profound and positive effect on their lives.
*16:08.020- 16:11.120* :  Now, I've already reported on this podcast on how climate change
*16:11.120- 16:16.140* :  is creating more favorable conditions for the invasive Asian tiger mosquito
*16:16.140- 16:19.420* :  to spread into new environments and new countries,
*16:19.420- 16:21.500* :  bringing with it a range of diseases.
*16:22.180- 16:25.240* :  Now the World Health Organization says the number of mosquito-borne
*16:25.240- 16:27.380* :  dengue fever cases so far this year
*16:27.680- 16:30.900* :  has already overtaken those for the whole of last year
*16:31.180- 16:33.380* :  with Brazil the worst affected country.
*16:33.840- 16:36.320* :  So far, there have been 8 million cases globally.
*16:36.880- 16:40.280* :  Our health correspondent Dominic Hughes was at the WHO briefing.
*16:41.080- 16:43.280* :  The spread really seems to have taken off.
*16:43.280- 16:46.240* :  In December of last year, the World Health Organization
*16:46.240- 16:50.120* :  issued what they basically said was an emergency call to action,
*16:50.640- 16:54.700* :  given a rise in cases, but the cases so far this year,
*16:54.700- 16:58.840* :  more than seven and a half, in fact nearly 8 million cases so far this year
*16:59.240- 17:03.080* :  have already outstripped the entire total for last year,
*17:03.560- 17:06.720* :  and they warned that the true figure could be even higher,
*17:06.720- 17:08.560* :  closer to 9 million.
*17:09.040- 17:11.700* :  Now so far, there have been around 4,000 deaths,
*17:11.700- 17:14.360* :  and most of them have been in Central and South America,
*17:14.360- 17:17.580* :  but of course that's where most of the season,
*17:17.640- 17:19.780* :  if you like, for dengue fever for the Mosquito
*17:19.780- 17:22.600* :  that carries the dengue fever has been this year,
*17:22.600- 17:26.860* :  we haven't really seen it spread to the northern hemispheres
*17:26.860- 17:29.520* :  where we're just starting to get into summer.
*17:30.240- 17:33.800* :  Okay, and why is this happening this time, particularly?
*17:34.180- 17:36.900* :  Well, it's a very complex picture we're told.
*17:37.300- 17:39.340* :  Part of it is being driven by climate change
*17:39.940- 17:43.880* :  as the oceans warm, that helps the Mosquitoes spread
*17:43.880- 17:46.920* :  and they're spreading further north and further south,
*17:47.560- 17:50.620* :  so the disease is spread by Mosquitoes,
*17:50.620- 17:52.060* :  which bite people during the day,
*17:52.060- 17:54.300* :  so it's not a nighttime thing, it's a daytime thing,
*17:54.900- 17:56.260* :  but those Mosquitoes are spreading,
*17:56.260- 17:57.680* :  and they're not just north and south,
*17:57.700- 17:59.120* :  but they're also spreading higher up,
*17:59.120- 18:01.020* :  so they've been found at altitudes
*18:01.540- 18:04.040* :  where cases have never been discovered before.
*18:04.040- 18:06.800* :  So they talk about the Mosquitoes as the vector
*18:07.000- 18:07.960* :  of disease transmission,
*18:08.040- 18:10.980* :  and they say it's affecting 150 countries,
*18:11.500- 18:12.960* :  a lot of countries aren't really aware,
*18:12.960- 18:16.240* :  it's spreading into places like Europe increasingly,
*18:16.240- 18:19.520* :  but the other big factor is weakened health systems
*18:19.520- 18:21.280* :  after the COVID pandemic,
*18:21.820- 18:24.740* :  that has triggered a lot of movement of people,
*18:24.740- 18:27.540* :  but also a lot of weakened health systems
*18:27.540- 18:29.820* :  still struggling with the after effects
*18:29.820- 18:31.320* :  of that tremendous pandemic.
*18:31.520- 18:34.360* :  You can't treat dengue fever, that's the big problem,
*18:34.360- 18:36.260* :  so what can you do to curb it?
*18:36.380- 18:39.540* :  Yeah, I mean, there are a couple of vaccines
*18:39.700- 18:40.440* :  that are available,
*18:40.440- 18:41.740* :  but they're used in really,
*18:42.180- 18:44.120* :  honestly, very limited circumstances.
*18:45.440- 18:47.700* :  The main way of treating it is prevention,
*18:47.700- 18:51.020* :  so preventing the Mosquitoes from being up to breed,
*18:51.020- 18:52.280* :  so that means, for example,
*18:52.880- 18:54.580* :  getting rid of areas of stagnant water
*18:54.860- 18:56.200* :  in which the Mosquitoes breed,
*18:56.200- 18:58.960* :  so, and also making sure that areas,
*18:59.220- 19:00.540* :  for example, that have lots of rubbish
*19:00.540- 19:01.520* :  in a cleared away,
*19:01.520- 19:02.700* :  so rubbish on the street,
*19:02.700- 19:05.520* :  stagnant water around homes and gardens,
*19:06.100- 19:06.680* :  that sort of thing,
*19:06.680- 19:10.460* :  so it's really trying to both prevent the Mosquitoes
*19:10.500- 19:11.660* :  from breeding in the first place
*19:11.660- 19:13.280* :  to spread this disease,
*19:13.620- 19:15.540* :  but then also educating people themselves
*19:15.540- 19:16.860* :  about the risk of dengue
*19:17.300- 19:19.160* :  and measures they can take, for example,
*19:19.700- 19:21.140* :  wearing long sleeve tops, for example,
*19:21.140- 19:21.800* :  during the day,
*19:21.860- 19:23.760* :  so that their arms aren't exposed
*19:23.760- 19:25.220* :  to be bitten by the Mosquitoes.
*19:25.480- 19:27.280* :  Our health correspondent, Dominic Hughes.
*19:29.140- 19:30.700* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast?

*19:36.260- 19:37.660* :  to their uncles and kids.
*19:38.040- 19:39.500* :  Newspapers are talking about it.
*19:39.680- 19:40.680* :  It's just blown up over there.
*19:40.840- 19:41.860* :  The Scottish Postman,
*19:41.860- 19:44.460* :  who's created a surprise global football hit

*21:00.160- 21:02.300* :  Shareholders at the electric car company Tesla
*21:02.580- 21:05.360* :  have voted to approve a pay package of $56 billion
*21:05.360- 21:07.680* :  for its chief executive Elon Musk,
*21:07.960- 21:10.180* :  believed to be the biggest in US corporate history.
*21:10.640- 21:12.100* :  The decision was announced to devote
*21:12.100- 21:14.100* :  to Tesla's headquarters in Texas.
*21:14.740- 21:17.180* :  And North America business correspondent Erin Delmore
*21:17.180- 21:18.720* :  has been explaining to Oliver Conway
*21:18.860- 21:21.000* :  the case for Mr. Musk getting so much.
*21:21.460- 21:22.660* :  He deserves a sum.
*21:23.060- 21:24.440* :  And that's because he's taken the company
*21:24.440- 21:26.500* :  to such heights since this pay deal was
*21:26.960- 21:28.460* :  initially ratified by the board
*21:28.460- 21:30.400* :  and by shareholders back in 2018.
*21:31.140- 21:34.540* :  Now, the case against him has been that he's spread thin.
*21:35.080- 21:37.440* :  And certainly he's had some controversial
*21:37.440- 21:40.180* :  leadership over the last few months and years.
*21:40.740- 21:43.600* :  Now, this is essentially a vote of confidence
*21:43.600- 21:46.400* :  in Mr. Musk's leadership and the future of the firm.
*21:46.860- 21:48.660* :  To put it very simply, the people who voted
*21:48.840- 21:51.100* :  for this pay package think that Tesla just
*21:51.120- 21:52.380* :  can't operate without him.
*21:52.980- 21:56.220* :  Yeah, a public relations win for Elon Musk.
*21:56.360- 21:58.420* :  But this will still have to go back to court
*21:58.420- 22:01.080* :  if he's to secure this pay package.
*22:01.080- 22:02.600* :  What could happen there?
*22:03.460- 22:04.940* :  Right, it's not quite so simple
*22:04.940- 22:06.580* :  as shareholders vote in favor
*22:06.780- 22:08.520* :  and the pay package gets instated.
*22:09.040- 22:11.320* :  No, this is likely to be tied back up in the courts
*22:11.320- 22:14.400* :  because remember, a Delaware judge struck us down.
*22:14.400- 22:17.940* :  He said that it was not going to be going into effect.
*22:17.940- 22:21.360* :  Now, the board is hoping that by showing the shareholder approval,
*22:21.360- 22:23.120* :  they can use it as proof positive
*22:23.120- 22:25.780* :  that this is something that investors want
*22:25.780- 22:28.780* :  to see happen and want Musk to be awarded.
*22:29.380- 22:30.740* :  But it will have to go through the courts
*22:30.740- 22:32.820* :  and could even see fresh new legal challenges.
*22:33.300- 22:35.980* :  Now, some of the big investors weren't happy about this.
*22:36.000- 22:37.300* :  They said they were going to vote against.
*22:37.300- 22:40.440* :  They called the pay deal ridiculous and excessive.
*22:41.140- 22:44.480* :  But the so-called retail or ordinary investors
*22:44.740- 22:46.300* :  backed it in huge numbers.
*22:46.300- 22:49.740* :  Why does Elon Musk inspire such devotion?
*22:50.480- 22:52.480* :  This is one of the quirks of this story here
*22:52.480- 22:55.120* :  and it's because Tesla has more retail investors,
*22:55.120- 22:58.000* :  individual investors than a lot of companies do.
*22:58.000- 22:59.220* :  Just a greater share of them.
*22:59.600- 23:00.760* :  Make up Tesla's ownership.
*23:01.220- 23:03.240* :  That and the support we see today
*23:03.240- 23:06.160* :  speaks to Mr. Musk's cult of personality.
*23:06.860- 23:08.120* :  They are flocking to Tesla
*23:08.120- 23:09.500* :  because they are following him
*23:09.500- 23:11.520* :  and perhaps also following his endeavors
*23:11.520- 23:13.720* :  at the other companies that he owns.
*23:14.180- 23:15.560* :  That support ended up being crucial
*23:16.000- 23:18.560* :  and not only did those retail investors
*23:18.560- 23:20.460* :  and many of the institutional investors
*23:20.460- 23:22.220* :  also vote for this pay package,
*23:22.800- 23:24.100* :  they came out to vote at all.
*23:24.340- 23:25.740* :  That was looking to be the challenge
*23:25.740- 23:26.980* :  in the past couple of weeks.
*23:27.380- 23:29.760* :  Turning out voters especially these individuals
*23:29.760- 23:32.500* :  who own small amounts of shares in Tesla.
*23:32.960- 23:35.260* :  So this is essentially a large win
*23:35.700- 23:37.040* :  for Tesla's chief executive
*23:37.040- 23:40.200* :  and it makes him the most generously awarded CEO
*23:40.800- 23:42.040* :  in U.S. corporate history.
*23:42.640- 23:45.220* :  And North America business correspondent Erin Delmore.
*23:45.780- 23:48.040* :  The UN Security Council has voted to demand
*23:48.040- 23:50.040* :  an end to the siege of El Fasha
*23:50.040- 23:51.660* :  in Sudan's Darfur region
*23:51.660- 23:54.100* :  by the paramilitary rapid support forces.
*23:54.720- 23:56.640* :  Fourteen countries back the resolution
*23:56.640- 23:57.940* :  with Russia abstaining.
*23:58.420- 24:00.480* :  El Fasha is the only city in Darfur
*24:00.480- 24:02.200* :  that remains under army control
*24:02.540- 24:05.160* :  amidst a civil war that's lasted more than a year.
*24:05.620- 24:06.720* :  Nenditurfik has more.
*24:07.300- 24:09.880* :  Ambassador Barbara Woodward said the UK put forward
*24:09.880- 24:12.960* :  the resolution to help secure a localized ceasefire
*24:12.960- 24:15.660* :  around El Fasha to create wider conditions
*24:15.660- 24:18.500* :  to support de-escalation across the country
*24:18.500- 24:20.780* :  and ultimately to save lives.
*24:21.380- 24:23.200* :  The threat of a large-scale massacre
*24:23.200- 24:25.260* :  looms large the U.S. Ambassador
*24:25.260- 24:27.000* :  Linda Thomas Greenfield warned
*24:27.000- 24:29.060* :  and already villages have been raised
*24:29.060- 24:31.900* :  to the ground and hospitals bombed and looted.
*24:32.420- 24:34.860* :  The text calls further withdrawal of all fighters
*24:34.860- 24:36.080* :  that threaten civilians
*24:36.540- 24:38.300* :  and for those civilians to be allowed
*24:38.300- 24:39.960* :  to leave to safer areas.
*24:40.640- 24:43.580* :  To overcome persistent aid access obstructions
*24:43.580- 24:45.780* :  that have pushed people to the brink of famine,
*24:45.780- 24:48.700* :  the council also wants the parties to allow
*24:48.700- 24:52.020* :  and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance
*24:52.060- 24:55.300* :  with a specific call for Sudanese authorities
*24:55.300- 24:57.760* :  to reopen the Audre border crossing.
*24:58.460- 25:01.520* :  Sierra Leone's ambassador Amara Sheikh Mohammed Sawa
*25:01.880- 25:04.700* :  speaking on behalf of the African members of the council
*25:05.140- 25:06.760* :  denounced foreign interference,
*25:06.860- 25:10.020* :  saying the Sudanese people don't need more arms,
*25:10.020- 25:11.000* :  they need peace.
*25:11.660- 25:13.580* :  The resolution calls on member states
*25:13.580- 25:15.920* :  to comply with the Darfur Arms embargo.
*25:16.800- 25:18.760* :  The war in Sudan has killed thousands
*25:18.760- 25:20.720* :  and forced millions from their homes
*25:21.280- 25:23.580* :  and that conflict is one of the contributing factors
*25:23.580- 25:25.580* :  behind a staggering new statistic,
*25:26.000- 25:28.960* :  a total of 120 million people around the world
*25:29.300- 25:30.780* :  who've been forcibly displaced
*25:30.780- 25:33.040* :  by war, violence and persecution.
*25:33.660- 25:34.960* :  That figure, which is the equivalent
*25:34.960- 25:36.380* :  of the population of Japan,
*25:36.860- 25:38.840* :  has risen for the 12 year in a row
*25:38.840- 25:40.880* :  according to the UN Refugee Agency.
*25:41.380- 25:43.500* :  Kelly Clemens, the body's Deputy High Commissioner,
*25:43.820- 25:46.180* :  explained why so many people have been displaced.
*25:46.940- 25:48.280* :  It is a combination of factors.
*25:48.280- 25:51.580* :  We have some longstanding crises and conflicts
*25:52.560- 25:53.780* :  with no political solution
*25:54.120- 25:57.640* :  and people continued to be either internally displaced
*25:57.640- 25:58.560* :  in their own countries
*25:59.260- 26:02.480* :  or most of them have gone to neighboring countries
*26:03.120- 26:05.400* :  to wait for peace, to return to their home communities
*26:05.400- 26:07.060* :  so that they too can return.
*26:07.820- 26:11.040* :  And these are places like Afghanistan, Syria,
*26:11.880- 26:14.940* :  now Ukraine, Venezuela and Myanmar.
*26:15.260- 26:16.700* :  And then on top of that,
*26:16.740- 26:18.440* :  and particularly in the last year,
*26:19.120- 26:20.680* :  you have fresh misery.
*26:20.940- 26:23.100* :  And I think the best example of that,
*26:23.560- 26:24.120* :  there are two.
*26:24.460- 26:25.960* :  One, of course, is in Gaza
*26:26.200- 26:28.620* :  and the other, in terms of misery,
*26:28.620- 26:30.200* :  is the Sudan situation.
*26:30.880- 26:34.700* :  And in Sudan, we're talking about nearly 11 million people,
*26:35.080- 26:36.460* :  most internally displaced
*26:36.460- 26:38.320* :  and displaced multiple times.
*26:38.320- 26:41.940* :  But you also have refugees that have gone to South Sudan,
*26:42.700- 26:44.260* :  to Chad, to Ethiopia,
*26:44.260- 26:46.820* :  and other neighboring countries.
*26:46.860- 26:50.900* :  And these are countries that have already been hosting
*26:50.940- 26:54.500* :  Sudanese refugees from crises and wars in the past.
*26:54.740- 26:56.780* :  So it's a combination of factors
*26:56.940- 26:58.260* :  in terms of new crises
*26:58.780- 27:00.140* :  and those protracted situations
*27:00.140- 27:01.820* :  that have no political solution.
*27:02.440- 27:04.460* :  The UNHCR's Kelly Clements there.
*27:05.080- 27:06.040* :  Now, to Kazakhstan,
*27:06.040- 27:09.540* :  where wild horses have returned to their ancestral lands
*27:09.540- 27:11.940* :  for the first time in 200 years
*27:11.940- 27:15.040* :  after decades of planning by conservationists.
*27:15.620- 27:17.880* :  A small herd taken from zoos around Europe
*27:17.880- 27:21.140* :  is being gradually reintroduced into the grass and wetland there.
*27:21.520- 27:22.860* :  Here's Stephanie Prentice.
*27:24.980- 27:27.500* :  A tentative step out of a shipping crate
*27:28.220- 27:30.820* :  followed by a canter across the grassland.
*27:31.460- 27:34.480* :  A mere named Tessa, the first of her kind to step
*27:34.520- 27:36.960* :  butting has extorned for two centuries.
*27:38.200- 27:40.440* :  Some of her stablemates weren't so easy.
*27:43.600- 27:45.980* :  But a team of conservationists from Prague Zoo
*27:45.980- 27:49.160* :  were determined to reintroduce Pizzerowski's horses,
*27:49.540- 27:52.620* :  seen as the last of the world's truly wild horses
*27:53.020- 27:54.500* :  to their original habitat.
*27:56.680- 27:59.320* :  They ferried one stallion and six mayors
*27:59.320- 28:00.960* :  in army planes across Europe
*28:01.360- 28:02.920* :  via Istanbul and Azerbaijan.
*28:03.760- 28:06.440* :  Miroslav Bobek is the director of the operation.
*28:08.380- 28:09.820* :  These are the first wild horses
*28:09.820- 28:11.480* :  which have touched soil in the steps
*28:11.480- 28:13.600* :  of central Kazakhstan in hundreds of years.
*28:14.160- 28:15.960* :  We managed to get these horses here
*28:15.960- 28:17.760* :  from Prague alive and healthy.
*28:18.300- 28:19.720* :  And of course more will follow.
*28:20.560- 28:22.100* :  These are just the first step.
*28:22.440- 28:24.680* :  The sandy brown horses with thick dark
*28:24.680- 28:27.740* :  mains and tails once roamed across central Asia.
*28:28.380- 28:30.420* :  Artifact show people were riding them
*28:30.420- 28:33.300* :  and using them for food for at least 2,000 years
*28:33.300- 28:36.600* :  before records of any domestic horses in Europe.
*28:37.160- 28:40.400* :  Biodiversity specialist Alba Salam-Gyarev
*28:40.400- 28:41.940* :  says bringing the horses back
*28:41.940- 28:45.020* :  will also help restore the ecosystem of the step
*28:45.260- 28:46.280* :  by spreading seeds.
*28:47.200- 28:49.720* :  For scientists, it's also quite important
*28:49.720- 28:51.340* :  to have these wild horses
*28:52.100- 28:53.580* :  in the central Kazakhstan,
*28:53.960- 28:57.600* :  the wild horses serve another important role,
*28:58.080- 28:59.080* :  especially for the step,
*28:59.460- 29:02.440* :  to distribute non-native or not common plants.
*29:03.380- 29:05.820* :  It's a role they have some time to adapt to.
*29:06.040- 29:08.440* :  The group will stay in a 60 hectare pen
*29:08.440- 29:09.420* :  for a round year
*29:09.800- 29:12.020* :  before facing the more brutal weather conditions
*29:12.020- 29:13.640* :  on the wider plains.
*29:14.140- 29:16.500* :  The horses have already been reintroduced
*29:16.500- 29:17.900* :  in China and Mongolia,
*29:18.320- 29:20.820* :  where the population now numbers more than 800.
*29:21.460- 29:23.500* :  Prague Zoo says it wants to play the role
*29:23.560- 29:25.300* :  of a modern Noah's Ark,
*29:25.760- 29:28.200* :  making sure endangered species can survive
*29:28.200- 29:30.440* :  before putting them back where they belong.
*29:31.640- 29:32.740* :  Now, if you're a football fan,
*29:32.740- 29:34.520* :  the weight is almost over
*29:34.520- 29:36.720* :  because the euros are almost upon us.
*29:37.100- 29:38.780* :  Millions of soccer fans around the world
*29:38.780- 29:40.440* :  will follow the tournament in Germany,
*29:40.440- 29:42.140* :  either by going there or from home,
*29:42.140- 29:44.880* :  maybe wearing the shirt of your favourite team.
*29:45.400- 29:47.400* :  And those outfits are big business,
*29:47.580- 29:49.320* :  but prices have been rocketing.
*29:49.860- 29:51.780* :  This dance, as he can't afford to buy his children,
*29:52.040- 29:53.360* :  the officially licensed kits.
*29:53.800- 29:56.620* :  I can get basically shirts for all four of my children
*29:57.040- 29:59.620* :  for the cost of one shirt legitimately.
*30:00.040- 30:02.900* :  There are children who are demanding
*30:03.180- 30:05.080* :  and parents are under a lot of pressure.
*30:05.520- 30:07.000* :  I'm fortunate to be in a position
*30:07.540- 30:09.520* :  where I can even afford the copies.
*30:09.880- 30:10.860* :  I know there are people now
*30:11.060- 30:13.880* :  who unfortunately are probably struggling even to buy it out
*30:13.880- 30:15.720* :  because money is so tight.
*30:16.020- 30:18.540* :  The rise in prices has led to a huge increase
*30:18.540- 30:19.700* :  in counterfeit shirts,
*30:20.180- 30:21.740* :  but consumer groups have worn the fans
*30:21.740- 30:23.880* :  about buying from potentially dodgy sites.
*30:23.880- 30:27.760* :  The anteburn has been talking to our business reporter, Pierre Antoine-Denis.
*30:28.240- 30:30.420* :  Let's say that if you want to go the official route,
*30:31.000- 30:34.720* :  that will set you back about $108
*30:34.780- 30:36.880* :  for the official replica kit.
*30:37.460- 30:38.760* :  He kind of shocked some buyers
*30:38.760- 30:41.440* :  who just went out there looking for other options.
*30:42.040- 30:44.580* :  The popularity of this website
*30:44.740- 30:48.080* :  that are selling really, really good replica
*30:48.420- 30:50.640* :  are basically on the rise.
*30:51.440- 30:55.500* :  Globally, the damage for Nike is estimated to be around
*30:55.500- 31:00.020* :  $3.6 billion as part of this counterfeits website.
*31:00.720- 31:02.260* :  That is a lot of money to lose,
*31:02.400- 31:04.180* :  but at the same time, I understand why people
*31:04.180- 31:07.760* :  might want to go towards the fake shirts route
*31:07.920- 31:09.200* :  because it is a lot cheaper.
*31:09.200- 31:12.100* :  But the thing is, if you show up at the Euros with a fake shirt,
*31:12.100- 31:14.900* :  that could be a bit of an issue for you, couldn't it?
*31:15.120- 31:18.020* :  The German authorities are very strict on this.
*31:18.020- 31:19.560* :  The Germans are hosting the Euros.
*31:20.060- 31:24.380* :  They can find people carrying these counterfeit items
*31:24.940- 31:27.520* :  up to around $6,000.
*31:28.340- 31:30.740* :  And also, of course, another important point here.
*31:30.740- 31:32.980* :  This website may not be entirely secure.
*31:33.300- 31:35.160* :  So giving away your bank details,
*31:35.160- 31:37.980* :  your identity, your address to these platforms
*31:37.980- 31:40.620* :  may actually cost you much more
*31:40.620- 31:43.940* :  than your actual Nike shirt in the official shop.
*31:44.620- 31:46.900* :  Staying with football, a postman from Scotland
*31:46.900- 31:48.780* :  has created an unofficial anthem
*31:49.140- 31:50.620* :  for his nation's Euros team,
*31:50.980- 31:52.700* :  which has become a surprise success
*31:52.700- 31:55.140* :  among football fans far away from home.
*31:56.140- 31:57.760* :  He was a febber, I've been told,
*31:57.760- 32:00.640* :  I've triumphant, this is me.
*32:01.360- 32:02.620* :  They talk a tune.
*32:02.620- 32:05.340* :  Meet Morgan's, no Scotland, no party,
*32:05.840- 32:07.720* :  has struck a chord in Argentina.
*32:07.820- 32:10.420* :  Its tune comes from a popular song
*32:10.420- 32:13.380* :  about Diego Maradona called The Hand of God,
*32:13.380- 32:16.580* :  which celebrates his controversial goal against England
*32:16.580- 32:18.560* :  in the 1986 World Cup.
*32:18.560- 32:21.760* :  Nick says he's astonished at how it's been received there.
*32:22.120- 32:24.540* :  It's crazy. I'm getting hundreds of in-request.
*32:24.540- 32:27.220* :  I'm getting messages asking for a face-time messages
*32:27.220- 32:28.620* :  to their uncles and kids,
*32:28.920- 32:30.420* :  news papers are talking about it.
*32:30.580- 32:32.680* :  I'm doing radio interviews, you know,
*32:32.680- 32:35.220* :  sports channels, it's just blown up over there.
