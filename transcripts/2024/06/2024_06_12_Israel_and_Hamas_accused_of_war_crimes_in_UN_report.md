*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:08.740* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week.
*00:08.740- 00:12.620* :  BBC World Service Podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.440- 00:18.120* :  So, how do we get AI right?
*00:18.580- 00:25.820* :  Well, we need the right volume of data, the software to train it, and massive compute power, or...
*00:25.920- 00:27.300* :  Another one bites the dust.
*00:28.040- 00:28.520* :  Are you ready?
*00:28.520- 00:30.020* :  Hey, are you ready for this?
*00:30.280- 00:31.680* :  Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
*00:31.860- 00:36.640* :  But with HPE GreenLake, we get access to supercomputing to power AI at the scale we need,
*00:36.800- 00:38.260* :  helping generate better insights.
*00:38.620- 00:39.740* :  All right!
*00:41.460- 00:42.340* :  Nice teamwork, guys.
*00:42.960- 00:44.000* :  Search HPE GreenLake.
*00:46.480- 00:50.900* :  I'm Katrina Perry from the Global Story Podcast where we're looking at Brazil's
*00:50.980- 00:52.080* :  Unending Flood.
*00:52.500- 00:58.460* :  One of its richest cities, Porto Elegre, is still struggling with flood waters that rushed in more than a month ago.
*00:58.920- 01:00.200* :  It's been a national shock.
*01:00.780- 01:04.800* :  Officials are still looking for bodies and warning of the spread of disease.
*01:04.860- 01:11.340* :  The Global Story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.
*01:12.000- 01:13.840* :  Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*01:18.060- 01:21.360* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World, sir.
*01:22.800- 01:29.260* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday 12th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:29.800- 01:32.420* :  War crimes and crimes against humanity.
*01:32.960- 01:38.040* :  The UN's devastating assessment of the actions of both Israel and Hamas in the Gaza conflict.
*01:38.780- 01:43.960* :  North Daphores main city is on the brink of falling to Sudan's paramilitary RSF,
*01:43.960- 01:45.600* :  according to the US envoy.
*01:46.080- 01:52.440* :  The European Union announces plans to impose stringent new import taxes on Chinese electric cars.
*01:55.060- 02:03.660* :  Also in this podcast, this is quite transformative for research that uses human tissue to improve diseases.
*02:04.640- 02:07.840* :  New hope for people suffering from a crippling bowel disease.
*02:11.500- 02:16.720* :  The conflict in Gaza, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7,
*02:16.720- 02:23.660* :  killing about 1200 people and taking 251 others hostage, has been devastating for the territory.
*02:23.660- 02:28.620* :  More than 37,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive since then,
*02:28.620- 02:30.940* :  according to the Hamas run health ministry.
*02:31.440- 02:33.180* :  And most of Gaza has been devastated.
*02:33.180- 02:37.260* :  For many neighborhoods, all that's left is the rubble of destroyed buildings.
*02:37.260- 02:42.420* :  Hundreds of thousands of civilians now forced to live in makeshift camps in dire conditions.
*02:42.540- 02:49.480* :  Now a UN Human Rights Investigation, led by the former UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay,
*02:49.480- 02:55.120* :  has blamed both warring sites of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*02:55.180- 02:58.360* :  Israel did not cooperate with the UN team.
*02:58.760- 03:02.580* :  Our correspondent in Geneva Imogen Fakes gave me more details.
*03:03.220- 03:05.300* :  This is very long and detailed reports.
*03:05.300- 03:09.180* :  Two, in fact, one which looks at the events of October 7 and one,
*03:09.220- 03:15.060* :  the subsequent response by Israel, a long, long list,
*03:16.220- 03:24.000* :  including the torture, murder, abduction of civilians in-discriminate attacks on civilians.
*03:24.420- 03:29.820* :  By both sides, Hamas has been firing rockets into Israel.
*03:30.460- 03:32.760* :  Israel has been bombing Gaza.
*03:33.480- 03:41.600* :  Both sides accused of, as I said, torture and sexual violence against civilians
*03:41.600- 03:45.800* :  designed in some cases to humiliate the entire population.
*03:46.360- 03:49.980* :  In addition, Israel's accused of using starvation as a weapon of war
*03:49.980- 03:57.480* :  and of not only not providing the means to survive such as food and water, which under international
*03:57.480- 04:04.500* :  law would be its responsibility, but of also preventing other groups, for example, aid agencies
*04:04.500- 04:10.540* :  of doing so. So very long detailed, very detailed report.
*04:10.620- 04:16.840* :  Israel has already rejected it, saying that it just shows the United Nations what it says is
*04:16.840- 04:24.620* :  systematic bias against Israel, but this report was written by a team of independent,
*04:24.620- 04:29.760* :  very experienced human rights investigators, including, as you said there in your introduction,
*04:29.760- 04:30.600* :  Navi Pile.
*04:31.060- 04:35.340* :  Yeah, the accusations, among the most serious that they could have made,
*04:36.020- 04:41.300* :  they weren't allowed access to Israel, as they were compiling this. How did they get the evidence?
*04:43.080- 04:50.100* :  Israel does not traditionally cooperate with these UN investigations because it sees them as biased,
*04:50.100- 04:56.480* :  but let's not forget the the prevention of UN investigators getting onto the ground where
*04:56.480- 05:04.460* :  violations have occurred is not new. Syria does not allow UN human rights investigators, neither.
*05:04.460- 05:11.880* :  For example, does Russia or China, but in today's modern world, it is still perfectly possible
*05:11.880- 05:19.480* :  to gather evidence. The team talked to survivors and witnesses who are now based in Turkey and
*05:19.480- 05:26.620* :  Egypt. These would be Palestinians. It also gathered extensive digital evidence satellite imagery,
*05:26.620- 05:34.460* :  forensic medical evidence videos taken, including by the people, the Hamas and other Palestinian
*05:34.460- 05:41.140* :  armed groups who attacked Israel on October the 7th. Quite horrific evidence with the investigators
*05:41.140- 05:48.160* :  say, no doubt whatsoever in their minds they have verified all of this that these atrocities
*05:48.160- 05:56.640* :  took place. I would say, even if an investigator can't get in on the ground, it is very possible
*05:56.680- 06:04.520* :  to gather the evidence nowadays and prove that very bad things have happened, which would be
*06:04.520- 06:11.420* :  violations of international law. Imagine folks in Geneva. Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to keep
*06:11.420- 06:17.940* :  alive a ceasefire plan in Gaza, backed by the UN Security Council, Egyptian and Qatari mediators
*06:17.940- 06:23.640* :  are meeting today to clarify the official Hamas response to the plan. Hamas welcomed it, but added
*06:23.640- 06:29.560* :  that it still wanted a permanent end to the fighting and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces
*06:29.560- 06:35.500* :  from Gaza. An unnamed Israeli official accused Hamas of changing key parts of the draft deal.
*06:35.960- 06:40.300* :  The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has arrived in Qatar to push for agreement
*06:40.300- 06:47.040* :  on the latest proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage-drilly steel. Tom Bateman is at the airport
*06:48.360- 06:53.820* :  in Doha. Well, the objective here in Doha is around trying to maintain momentum for this
*06:55.020- 06:59.840* :  ceasefire proposal backed by the Americans as Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*07:01.260- 07:08.120* :  will be meeting Qatari leaders here, of course key mediators between Israel and Hamas. We had this
*07:08.120- 07:14.360* :  crucial moment on Tuesday night where Hamas came back with its response to the proposal.
*07:15.480- 07:21.100* :  The group said that it was positive, its response was positive, but we know that there are
*07:21.100- 07:29.840* :  some of the key demands that they have always clung to. As Mr Blinken and senior officials arrive
*07:29.840- 07:36.120* :  here today, what Hamas wants are guarantees that there will be a permanent ceasefire and a full
*07:36.120- 07:42.620* :  Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, certainly in terms of what the Israelis are saying already,
*07:42.620- 07:49.180* :  nothing formal, but some noises that they are seeing this as so many conditions that it effectively
*07:49.180- 07:54.860* :  amounts to a rejection by Hamas of the deal. So I expect we're going to get from Mr Blinken
*07:55.860- 08:03.060* :  attempt to keep this thing afloat, crucial discussions with the Qataris during his
*08:03.980- 08:10.300* :  few hours here in Doha and attempt to maintain the momentum on this ceasefire proposal.
*08:11.100- 08:16.000* :  As we record this podcast, Mr Blinken has been speaking at a news conference in Qatar.
*08:16.600- 08:22.460* :  Here in a nutshell is where we stand. A deal was on the table that was virtually identical
*08:23.220- 08:29.560* :  to the proposal that Hamas put forward on May the 6th. A deal that the entire world is behind,
*08:30.760- 08:36.940* :  a deal Israel is accepted, and Hamas could have answered with a single word. Yes,
*08:38.700- 08:43.800* :  instead, Hamas waited nearly two weeks and then proposed more changes,
*08:45.320- 08:50.060* :  a number of which go beyond positions that had previously taken and accepted.
*08:50.800- 08:57.580* :  America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken. Since the war in Sudan broke out in April last year,
*08:57.580- 09:02.920* :  the paramilitary rapid support forces have been accused of committing terrible human rights abuses
*09:03.400- 09:08.560* :  in the western region of Darfur. Now, the US envoy to Sudan, Tom Periello,
*09:08.560- 09:14.360* :  has warned that the Deforey city of Elfasha could fall imminently, but he said the Biden
*09:14.360- 09:20.520* :  administration would not recognize a partitioning of the country. The RSF has laid siege to the city
*09:20.880- 09:27.260* :  as it attempts to rest its control from the Sudanese army and complete the group's hold on Darfur.
*09:27.600- 09:34.440* :  The BBC's deputy-Africa editor Ann Sawy spoke to Mr Periello about the consequences of the attack
*09:34.440- 09:40.400* :  on Elfasha. The situation Elfasha is horrific. We've already seen way too many civilians killed,
*09:40.820- 09:46.920* :  and as bad as it is, it could get worse any day if Elfasha falls. Not only the horrors that
*09:47.100- 09:52.240* :  would come from the battle, but as people flee, we've seen in earlier parts of the war where
*09:52.240- 09:58.360* :  Masleet in particular were ethnically cleansed as they were escaping situations like this. We need
*09:58.360- 10:05.020* :  this to end. And the RSF being fully in charge in Darfur. What does that mean for the conflict?
*10:05.020- 10:09.360* :  What does that pretend for the people there? For the people of Darfur, it's horrific. This is
*10:09.360- 10:15.340* :  really a last civilian safe haven, and we will see more refugees fleeing to Chad, which is already
*10:15.340- 10:21.280* :  bursting at the seams, even more ethnic tension and tribalization of the conflict. I think if
*10:21.280- 10:25.560* :  there's anyone in RSF territory who thinks taking Elfasha means somehow they will have a right
*10:25.560- 10:30.740* :  to the state of Darfur, they need to disillusion themselves of that myth. It does not mean that. We
*10:30.740- 10:36.420* :  will not recognize a partition of Darfur under any circumstances. And the international community has
*10:36.420- 10:41.180* :  been criticized for not paying as much attention to this conflict as other conflicts that are going
*10:41.180- 10:46.600* :  on at the moment. Is that a fair criticism? It is absolutely a fair criticism. The world has
*10:46.600- 10:51.340* :  ignored Sudan for far too long. And certainly Gaza has taken a lot of the attention, but this war
*10:51.340- 10:56.300* :  was going on for six months before the horrific attacks of October 7th. And you still weren't seeing
*10:56.300- 11:01.200* :  that kind of global attention. Some of that's about race and about treatments of Africa, some of it
*11:01.200- 11:06.660* :  specific, I think cynicism or skepticism about Sudan as having been a country of heartbreak.
*11:06.800- 11:12.480* :  Is this something that, you know, as US envoy on Sudan, do you struggle to get the attention of
*11:12.480- 11:17.660* :  people that you speak to internationally? We do. It's been a shocking disconnect between the
*11:17.700- 11:23.740* :  scale of this human crisis and the scale of attention given to it. I think the good news is that
*11:23.740- 11:27.720* :  the voices of the Sudanese people have begun to be heard over the last four or five months.
*11:27.980- 11:32.460* :  What would you like to see the international community do? Right now at the Sudanese people need
*11:32.460- 11:38.260* :  is countries around the world to demand peace and put pressure on the RSF and the SAF to come to
*11:38.260- 11:42.900* :  the table and to reach a national enforceable cessation of violence. The last thing they need is
*11:42.900- 11:46.660* :  more guns coming in, what they do need is more food and medicine and guarantees of humanitarian
*11:46.660- 11:51.840* :  access. We need the army to agree to talk so that we can get a negotiated solution. But in the
*11:51.840- 11:56.880* :  absence of that, again, we're seeing more communities start to look out for themselves, but that also
*11:56.880- 12:01.420* :  means starting to take up more arms, more popular mobilization. And that, again, is something that
*12:01.420- 12:06.140* :  actually makes it harder to bring this horrific war to an end. You say you need to get the army to
*12:06.140- 12:11.080* :  the talks and General Burhan has been unwilling to come to the talks. What reasons is he given?
*12:11.780- 12:16.780* :  I'll leave it to General Burhan and others to give their rationale. What we know is we can't get
*12:16.780- 12:22.140* :  the talks going without them. And so far that rationale has changed kind of day to day. And that
*12:22.140- 12:26.920* :  tends to reflect an underlying factor of simply not wanting to come to the talks. We hope that's
*12:26.920- 12:31.840* :  not true and we hope that they will see the value in ending this war. General Burhan's deputy has
*12:31.840- 12:37.660* :  just been to Moscow, seeking arms in exchange for setting up a nibbled base for Russia on the
*12:37.660- 12:42.020* :  Red Sea. What do you make of that? Well, sadly, I think it's an act of desperation,
*12:42.020- 12:46.300* :  not of strength. And even if I have some sympathy for that desperation on the South side,
*12:46.300- 12:50.960* :  it's really a recipe for extending this war for more death and suffering of the Sudanese people.
*12:50.960- 12:55.860* :  The real act of courage is to come to the negotiating table where we believe we can produce an
*12:55.860- 12:59.980* :  outcome that is good for the long term of a military accountable to the Sudanese people
*12:59.980- 13:06.020* :  that's professional and integrated. So this is a time for courageous leaders to see a way to
*13:06.020- 13:12.900* :  a solution into a victory for the Sudanese people. US envoy to Sudan Tom Periello speaking to Ansoi.
*13:14.020- 13:19.700* :  Are we about to see a trade war over electric cars between the European Union and China?
*13:19.700- 13:24.500* :  The EU has announced plans to impose new tariffs on imports of Chinese vehicles,
*13:24.500- 13:31.480* :  accusing Beijing of flooding the market with heavily subsidized vehicles. Taxes of up to 38 percent
*13:31.480- 13:36.840* :  will come into force next month unless talks to find a solution in the trade dispute are successful.
*13:36.840- 13:43.100* :  Meanwhile, China has already threatened to retaliate with tariffs on luxury European cars.
*13:43.600- 13:48.080* :  So what effects could the tariffs have? Bill Russo is the former chief executive of
*13:48.080- 13:52.700* :  Chrysler China and is now at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.
*13:53.580- 13:59.880* :  First of all, it will deprioritize markets, at least for those who are expecting to export,
*13:59.880- 14:06.520* :  made in China products. It will add cost obviously to the market, which obviously means that
*14:06.520- 14:10.420* :  consumers in those markets that are subjected to those tariffs are going to have to pay more.
*14:11.200- 14:15.040* :  I think they'll pay more in general because the companies that they're designed to protect
*14:15.840- 14:20.580* :  are not able to compete on price with the Chinese price. The tariffs are there to try to
*14:21.640- 14:25.380* :  protect. It's a protection mechanism for the domestic
*14:26.540- 14:32.560* :  industries where the tariffs are being placed. The tariffs are not coming into countries that
*14:32.560- 14:40.080* :  don't have domestic auto manufacturing. So this is very clearly an effort to try to buy time
*14:40.980- 14:46.940* :  for automakers who didn't prioritize EVs. It's very tough because they didn't prioritize EVs.
*14:46.940- 14:52.620* :  The Chinese got their faster and with a better and more vertically integrated supply chain
*14:52.620- 14:59.820* :  and more cost-effective product as a result of that. Tesla may have gotten to the EV faster,
*14:59.820- 15:06.460* :  but the Chinese were ready with more affordable EV alternatives. And that's why they
*15:06.620- 15:11.500* :  and given the fact that it's world's largest by far, 8.3 million new energy vehicles sold in
*15:11.500- 15:19.580* :  China last year, 60% of the world's EV production. So China has got the super scale or potential
*15:19.580- 15:24.820* :  which drives down the ability to deliver on cost. The rest of the world just didn't prioritize EV.
*15:25.520- 15:28.740* :  Bill Russo from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.
*15:30.100- 15:34.340* :  Scientists have taken a big step towards a new treatment for the debilitating
*15:34.340- 15:39.160* :  bowel condition, Crohn's disease. It affects millions of people, many of them children.
*15:39.440- 15:43.920* :  Researchers have used cells from patients to grow many versions of their own guts,
*15:44.400- 15:48.600* :  which they hope they can use to work out how best to treat every individual patient
*15:48.600- 15:55.240* :  here's Paul Day. Even at its mildest, Crohn's a form of inflammatory bowel disease can have a
*15:55.240- 16:01.260* :  major impact on the lives of people who suffer from it. Camilla was diagnosed when she was 25
*16:01.340- 16:07.320* :  and has now had the condition for six years. Crohn's for me has been life changing and at times
*16:07.320- 16:12.540* :  life destroying. I've just come out of a four and a half year flare-up. During that time I was
*16:12.540- 16:18.700* :  hospitalized at one point. I have been bedridden sometimes for weeks at a time. I've had all the
*16:18.700- 16:23.380* :  symptoms that you'd expect. So severe diarrhea, rapid weight loss, quite a lot of blood loss,
*16:23.900- 16:28.740* :  pain and fatigue, sometimes so severe that I've been unable to lift my head or speak in full
*16:29.780- 16:33.700* :  Now there's hope for people like Camilla thanks to a team at Cambridge University.
*16:34.640- 16:40.020* :  They've taken crucial stem cells from 160 donors including Crohn's disease patients
*16:40.800- 16:44.480* :  and grown them in the lab to form miniature versions of each person's gut,
*16:45.280- 16:50.200* :  which are described as looking a bit like cauliflower. Crohn's is different in almost every
*16:50.200- 16:54.680* :  individual. In some cases it affects the entire gut and doesn't respond to treatment.
*16:55.460- 17:01.280* :  For others it's milder and affects only part of the gut. That's why the scientists need quite
*17:01.280- 17:06.160* :  a large number of these mini-guts or organoids as they're known so that they can come up with a
*17:06.160- 17:12.620* :  treatment that will benefit as many people as possible. Matthias Silbauer is a gastroenterology
*17:12.620- 17:17.960* :  professor at Cambridge. He says this approach is likely to be a model in the treatment of many
*17:17.960- 17:26.700* :  other diseases. This is quite transformative for research that uses human tissue to improve diseases
*17:27.500- 17:33.460* :  because the tissue that we then take, unlike for example animal models, are much more reflective
*17:33.460- 17:39.540* :  of human disease and they are specific for each patient, each donor from which we generate these
*17:39.540- 17:44.900* :  cultures. Professor Silbauer and his colleagues are now testing drugs on the mini-guts.
*17:45.580- 17:50.940* :  The next step would be to try the drugs on Crohn's disease patients, maybe even tailoring
*17:50.940- 17:56.120* :  them to each individual. The hope is that could be achieved within five to ten years,
*17:56.220- 18:02.120* :  resulting in a major transformation for people whose lives are currently disrupted by a disease,
*18:02.840- 18:06.360* :  the cause of which is still unknown, despite decades of research.
*18:10.080- 18:14.380* :  Still to come in this podcast? It's very unclear how this all started.
*18:14.800- 18:19.980* :  There was no official complaint, but of course online people were saying about
*18:20.540- 18:26.600* :  Danish people can't handle the spice. Heated discussion online after Denmark recalls
*18:26.600- 18:29.340* :  Korean ramen for being too spicy.

*19:19.360- 19:22.500* :  Hey, are you ready for this? Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
*19:22.660- 19:27.460* :  But with HPE GreenLake, we get access to supercomputing to power AI at the scale we need,

*19:43.560- 19:49.580* :  It is a staggeringly high number. 19 million deaths a year caused by ultra-processed foods,
*19:49.580- 19:55.520* :  alcohol, tobacco, and fossil fuels. That, at least, is the conclusion of a report by the World
*19:55.520- 20:00.520* :  Health Organization, and it blames powerful industries, which, so the report says, are trying
*20:00.520- 20:05.780* :  to block government initiatives against those products. But the report has also drawn severe
*20:05.780- 20:09.700* :  criticism. A health correspondent Dominic Hughes has the details.
*20:10.400- 20:16.440* :  The World Health Organization report says more than 7,400 people die every day in Europe due to
*20:16.440- 20:21.780* :  harmful products and practices, and it pins the blame on four industries, those that produce
*20:21.780- 20:27.780* :  tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed foods, and fossil fuels. The global picture is even bleaker.
*20:27.780- 20:33.160* :  19 million deaths per year, more than a third of all fatalities. The report says these figures
*20:33.160- 20:37.780* :  don't even include deaths caused by obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, or high
*20:37.780- 20:43.080* :  cholesterol levels, all of which are linked to unhealthy diets. But the WHO says the industries
*20:43.720- 20:47.880* :  involved are actively trying to block the efforts of governments to improve the health of their
*20:47.880- 20:52.980* :  populations, interfering in health policies, which it says are regularly challenged, delayed,
*20:52.980- 20:57.940* :  weakened, or stopped by industry. It's a controversial conclusion by the WHO.
*20:58.300- 21:03.640* :  Many public health experts may agree with much of the report. It's been described as half-baked
*21:03.640- 21:09.860* :  Marxism by one free market think tank. Dominic Hughes. In the last five years, the Chinese
*21:09.860- 21:14.980* :  government has tightened its grip on Hong Kong, clamping down on protests and free speech in
*21:14.980- 21:19.800* :  the territory. As a result, many pro-democracy activists have sought asylum in the UK,
*21:20.540- 21:24.800* :  but their troubles have not stopped there. Now, the authorities in Hong Kong have cancelled
*21:24.800- 21:30.280* :  the passports of six activists who fled here, accusing them of endangering national security.
*21:30.280- 21:36.320* :  The territory's secretary for security, Chris Tang, also warned others not to support the
*21:36.320- 21:43.760* :  activists. Under our suspension and requirement, even they want to apply for a new passport,
*21:43.760- 21:53.560* :  it won't be allowed. And as I said, it will be illegal to provide fund or to handle their
*21:53.560- 21:58.980* :  fundings. It doesn't matter which platform is it, as long as they are providing funding or
*21:58.980- 22:02.600* :  assessing them, the handle of the funding, will be subject to criminal sanction.
*22:03.020- 22:08.040* :  I asked Asia-Pacific Regional Editor Celia Hatton about the significance of the move.
*22:08.600- 22:15.620* :  This is really just the latest attempt by the Hong Kong authorities to curtail the activities
*22:15.740- 22:22.240* :  of some major pro-democracy activists who've chosen to leave Hong Kong and live elsewhere,
*22:22.240- 22:29.700* :  but are still very much involved in speaking out for Hong Kong and trying to continue to keep the
*22:29.700- 22:35.920* :  Hong Kong pro-democracy movement alive. So by canceling their passports, it limits the ability
*22:35.920- 22:42.380* :  of these six men to travel, to go overseas, to give speeches, for example, in other western
*22:42.380- 22:48.180* :  countries. They haven't gone so far as to cancel their citizenship, so they're still connect to
*22:48.180- 22:52.800* :  Hong Kong. And in fact, they're wanted by the Hong Kong authorities. They have bounties on their
*22:52.800- 22:59.980* :  heads of one million Hong Kong dollars each. That's about 128,000 US dollars, but it does limit
*22:59.980- 23:04.220* :  their ability to travel unless they get some other kind of citizenship, of course.
*23:04.300- 23:08.060* :  So what have they been doing that has annoyed the Chinese authorities so much?
*23:08.540- 23:13.920* :  All six of these men have been, as I said, carrying on their activities. So they've been publishing
*23:13.920- 23:19.800* :  books detailing the pro-democracy movement, speaking out for the pro-democracy movement. They've
*23:19.800- 23:25.920* :  been speaking to western media outlets and really standing up and giving voice to the pro-democracy
*23:25.920- 23:32.020* :  movement. And I think the Hong Kong authorities really want to curtail the activities of these men
*23:32.020- 23:37.760* :  and other exiled activists, because they want to silence their voices. They want to scare them into
*23:37.760- 23:43.600* :  submission and to stop them from talking, but they also want to sever the ties between
*23:43.600- 23:51.220* :  these exiled activists and people in Hong Kong. So the diaspora outside of Hong Kong, which is very
*23:51.220- 23:57.480* :  talkative and active and eager to criticize the authorities in Hong Kong and the communist
*23:57.480- 24:02.240* :  leaders in Beijing, they want to sever those ties. And the key thing that they've also done today,
*24:02.240- 24:08.260* :  the Hong Kong authorities, is they've reminded people in Hong Kong that if they send any funds,
*24:08.260- 24:14.780* :  any financial ties between themselves and these exiled activists by funding Patreon accounts,
*24:14.780- 24:20.560* :  for example, that they themselves could be arrested by the police in Hong Kong and could face up
*24:20.560- 24:24.800* :  to seven years in prison. So they're trying to cut those financial ties as well.
*24:25.580- 24:26.520* :  Celia Hatton
*24:27.480- 24:33.160* :  Now to some heated discussion online in Denmark, because the food authorities have decided to
*24:33.160- 24:38.800* :  recall different packs of spicy ramen noodle made by a Korean company, they claim the spice
*24:38.800- 24:44.620* :  levels are too dangerous and could lead to acute poisoning. The Anna Byrne got more from our
*24:44.620- 24:49.940* :  business reporter Pierre Antoine Deney. It's a very strange story on very different level.
*24:50.080- 24:59.060* :  Three fiery flavors, if you want, of these Samyang instant ramen noodles, the bulldog spicy hot chicken,
*24:59.260- 25:05.740* :  some other spicy hot chicken, a bit less hot and the hot chicken stew, they're quite,
*25:05.740- 25:12.680* :  you know, very serious Denmark food authorities have just conducted some research and established
*25:12.680- 25:21.280* :  that they were way too spicy for the levels that they allow in the country and have asked for
*25:21.600- 25:27.040* :  for the products to be immediately recalled and for anyone who have a wine procession of these
*25:27.040- 25:34.740* :  noodles to return them to the stores for them to be discarded. It is believed that Samyang was not
*25:34.740- 25:41.060* :  even aware of it. They've learned it in the press. That's what we're trying to check at the minute,
*25:41.060- 25:45.320* :  but this is what it seems to be. Was there a complaint made about how spicy is
*25:45.320- 25:51.320* :  was that why the administrators looked into this? That is another angle of the story that we're
*25:51.320- 25:58.220* :  still looking at. It's very unclear how this all started because there was no official complaint
*25:58.300- 26:05.980* :  that has been reported. We've looked at Danish media as well and still nothing. But of course,
*26:05.980- 26:11.680* :  online people, you know, were saying about it just normal because Danish people can't handle
*26:11.680- 26:17.980* :  the spice for them. They anything that would eat, they believe it's too spicy. What's also
*26:17.980- 26:25.200* :  interesting is that Samyang foods are the global company here. Basically, the multimillion
*26:25.240- 26:33.420* :  dollars company, they are sending these noodles to approximately 80 countries, including the U.S.,
*26:33.520- 26:38.580* :  many countries in Europe. I've got friends in London that are eating them on a fairly regular
*26:38.580- 26:45.140* :  basis. They did tell me they were quite spicy as well. It's not coming out of the blue. It's not a
*26:45.140- 26:50.340* :  brand new product arriving into the market. They have been there for a long time. It isn't
*26:50.520- 26:53.960* :  plenty of different countries. I mean, that could happen to them then in other countries too.
*26:54.240- 26:58.540* :  Yes, exactly. It could happen to them in different countries. Maybe some other researchers are going
*26:58.540- 27:05.080* :  to start looking into this and think, okay, this can actually be a health hazard if it's eaten in
*27:05.540- 27:12.020* :  too big of a proportion. In a statement to the BBC, the firm Samyang has said that the Danish food
*27:12.020- 27:17.140* :  authority recalled the products not because of a problem in quality, but because they were
*27:17.740- 27:22.440* :  too spicy. It's the first time the product has been recalled for this reason.
*27:23.440- 27:29.380* :  Now, how long do you think you could last without your smartphone? A few hours, a day? Maybe two?
*27:29.900- 27:35.560* :  Well, we've followed a group of teenage college students in the north of England to see how they
*27:35.560- 27:42.820* :  cope without their smartphones for five whole days. It's after a survey of 2,000 young people
*27:43.200- 27:47.860* :  showed three-quarters of teenagers wouldn't swap their smartphone for a brick phone. That's a
*27:47.860- 27:53.780* :  device that you can only use for texts and calls. Our reporter, Christian Johnson, was there to follow
*27:53.780- 27:58.420* :  how they got on. On Friday, I received four hundred and seventy-eighths of
*27:59.020- 28:02.380* :  its fair to say some teenagers are pretty glued to their phones.
*28:06.320- 28:10.960* :  But this group of students are doing the unthinkable, locking them away for almost a week.
*28:13.340- 28:15.540* :  No tiktok, no snapchat, no WhatsApp.
*28:17.540- 28:24.740* :  So, guys, these are your new mobile phone. The only way of communicating, text and calls.
*28:24.740- 28:33.520* :  I want to knock you. This is where the little I can. They're going to have to learn a whole new set
*28:33.520- 28:39.640* :  of skills for the next week to be able to adapt and continue their life as close to what it used to be,
*28:39.680- 28:43.940* :  but with that mobile phone, underpinning most of their activities, it's going to be a real challenge.
*28:47.700- 28:50.640* :  So, in the mornings, usually I'll like search up the tram times,
*28:51.080- 28:54.640* :  saying, I know, oh yeah, I need to leave in five minutes. Oh yeah, I've got a little bit of time
*28:54.640- 28:59.260* :  before I need to leave. Without a phone, I've got no way I know when the next tram will be.
*29:00.200- 29:04.080* :  And not being involved in group chats means it's harder for Ruby to meet up with friends.
*29:04.800- 29:08.100* :  I feel like with the knock-yum kind of missing out a bit more on social interaction.
*29:08.780- 29:10.600* :  But most are focusing on the positives.
*29:11.440- 29:15.820* :  A lot of my friends actually learn and stuff and engage them on noticing stuff around me,
*29:15.820- 29:18.540* :  which I probably should be noticing anyways, but I'm just too addicted to my phone.
*29:19.040- 29:24.160* :  Usually before I go to bed, I usually just watch Disney post for like an hour and then just drift off,
*29:24.680- 29:28.840* :  but since then, I've just gone straight to sleep and it's weird. It feels much better.
*29:29.080- 29:33.660* :  The more time goes on, it becomes a lot easier to think of things to do because you've not got
*29:33.660- 29:35.180* :  your phones. It's like, oh, new message.
*29:35.180- 29:41.140* :  Will's mom, Alison, admits not being able to use family tracking apps like Life 360 is a hindrance,
*29:41.480- 29:45.480* :  but she's noticed big changes in her son just three days into the detox.
*29:46.360- 29:48.460* :  Actually quite nice seeing you without her headphones for it.
*29:49.200- 29:54.440* :  Don't see you that much normally. I think it's just become the norm, whereas actual
*29:54.440- 29:59.800* :  social interaction does require to put these things away and engage a little bit more.
*30:00.800- 30:06.640* :  Five days later, it's the end of term and time to get those smartphones back.
*30:08.600- 30:12.560* :  Maybe I'll put my phone away in the car and I'll put my phone away like when I'm around my friends,
*30:13.520- 30:17.360* :  but in general, like going on TikTok and everything, I'm still going to do that.
*30:17.360- 30:20.280* :  Like, if anything, I'm going to do it more now.
*30:20.500- 30:25.620* :  I think it's been pretty difficult without a smartphone, but I've managed to get through it all right.
*30:26.060- 30:30.080* :  I'll try and use less of TikTok. That's for sure. I know my screen time is quite high on that.
*30:30.680- 30:34.680* :  Judging by their initial reaction, perhaps the students aren't quite ready to give up
*30:34.680- 30:39.140* :  their smartphone entirely, but the detox might start to slowly change their habits.
*30:41.020- 30:45.480* :  Christian Johnson with that report. The renowned French singer,
*30:45.480- 30:51.880* :  songwriter and fashion icon Francois Adi has died. She was 80. Known for her distinctive voice
*30:52.140- 30:59.660* :  she gained international fame in the 1960s. Alice Adi looks back at her life and legacy in French music.
*31:07.280- 31:15.100* :  Francois Adi was the epitome of 1960s Parisian chic and she captivated the world with her hypnotic
*31:15.100- 31:23.460* :  voice and effortless style. Born in 1944, she released her debut album in 1962 and quickly
*31:23.460- 31:30.560* :  captivated audiences with her melancholic and introspective songs. Adi's music often blended
*31:30.560- 31:37.280* :  elements of folk, pop and chanson frances and her lyrics explored themes of love, introspection
*31:37.280- 31:43.300* :  and the complexities of life. Hits like Toulé Gasson et les filles de mon âge
*31:43.300- 31:46.620* :  se promet dans la rue de Paris. Hits like Toulé Gasson et les filles de mon âge se promet dans la rue de Paris.
*31:46.620- 31:51.720* :  Hits like Toulé Gasson et les filles et le ton de l'amour remain classics to this day
*31:51.720- 31:58.860* :  and her influence on subsequent generations of musicians is undeniable. Beyond her music, Francois
*31:58.860- 32:05.520* :  Adi's fashion sense also left a lasting mark. She epitomized the yeye style of the 1960s
*32:05.840- 32:11.820* :  with her fringe short dresses and simple yet elegant wardrobe. Her timeless beauty and fashion
*32:11.820- 32:18.980* :  choices continue to inspire. Francois Adi's career spans several decades and she remains an iconic
*32:18.980- 32:25.380* :  figure. Her contributions to both fields have left an indelible mark, making her a beloved and
*32:25.380- 32:41.440* :  enduring cultural icon. Alice Adeli. And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new
