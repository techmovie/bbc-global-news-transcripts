*01:56.040- 02:00.500* :  So Finland has invited people from around the world to take part in a 5-day masterclass

*02:01.920- 02:07.440* :  The hackers there is no hack happiness is all around you and all you have to do is look
*02:07.440- 02:10.140* :  it's right in front of you, surprise it's there.
*02:11.360- 02:15.560* :  We've been following the happiness hackers across Helsinki and its islands as they share
*02:15.560- 02:16.900* :  their ideas and tips.
*02:17.280- 02:23.540* :  In Helsinki, they don't have to play anything, you're just allowed to be SBR.
*02:23.980- 02:28.120* :  When you make people sit around one table, people get along much better.
*02:28.760- 02:34.600* :  We have nature everywhere, it's even in the most open places when you open your eyes
*02:34.640- 02:35.060* :  for it.
*02:35.400- 02:38.460* :  Also, widows of pessimism doesn't preclude happiness.
*02:39.160- 02:42.160* :  So quite a lot to get through, let's start by meeting Lena.
*02:52.420- 02:59.320* :  Lena Salmi is a skateboarder, a graffiti artist, a very stylish woman who graces the streets
*02:59.320- 03:04.020* :  of Helsinki, her home city, in her own inimitable style.
*03:04.520- 03:09.000* :  You're a social media influencer as well and you're also 70.
*03:09.760- 03:11.160* :  It's very nice to meet you Lena.
*03:11.620- 03:15.220* :  Do tell us what happiness means for you.
*03:15.660- 03:23.000* :  It makes me happy to be just yourself in Helsinki, we don't have to play anything, we're
*03:23.000- 03:29.780* :  just allowed to be SBR, if people are ashamed of it, let's go, let's go.
*03:30.800- 03:32.500* :  And you start every day with ice cream.
*03:33.080- 03:40.880* :  I can't begin my day without ice cream, then I was young, we have to eat spores every
*03:40.880- 03:42.880* :  day, that's not bad.
*03:42.980- 03:52.320* :  Someday I wasn't at so good mood, then I decided when I moved on my own, I will eat
*03:52.320- 03:57.840* :  ice cream every day and that's the best advice ever.
*03:58.740- 04:01.740* :  And you took up the skateboard, why the skateboard?
*04:02.580- 04:03.520* :  Why do I not?
*04:04.360- 04:13.440* :  I feel the freedom, I can move and use my body and when I skate along the street, people
*04:13.440- 04:17.960* :  will watch at me but they don't laugh at me, that's the point.
*04:18.780- 04:23.720* :  And you are one of the people who is going to be imparting your happiness wisdom, what
*04:23.720- 04:26.620* :  is your happiness hack, what will you be telling the participants?
*04:27.460- 04:36.440* :  Just release your inner thinking, just let it go, let it go, I used to think that the
*04:36.480- 04:43.720* :  people will laugh at me, but never mind, let them laugh at you, hey, just be yourself.
*04:44.620- 04:50.080* :  Okay so what would you say to someone who is a complete novice who wants to learn how
*04:50.080- 04:50.700* :  to skateboard?
*04:51.160- 04:58.000* :  As your friends, if you don't have any skateboarding friends, never mind, as just somebody
*04:58.480- 05:03.920* :  who takes your hands and they will help do it that.
*05:04.820- 05:07.980* :  Are you going to do that for me, can you still, can you do that for me?
*05:08.840- 05:09.780* :  I will beat you.
*05:10.260- 05:11.580* :  And listener, so she did.
*05:12.380- 05:13.120* :  So what do I do?
*05:13.520- 05:24.280* :  Get skateboard, a wide stance, so, yeah, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, so, skateboard,
*05:25.100- 05:26.700* :  this is much harder than you made it look.
*05:29.680- 05:37.760* :  You need a skateboard, you need it, you need it, I'm a natural, well of course Laina is
*05:37.760- 05:43.700* :  one of the happiness hackers and it wasn't just me that got a lesson, don't, he, don't,
*05:43.860- 05:46.300* :  he is, and what, oh we are sure.
*06:04.540- 06:11.180* :  And don't worry, no podcasters were injured in the making of that report.
*06:11.740- 06:15.860* :  So clearly Laina has a firm grasp on what brings her joy.
*06:16.500- 06:20.580* :  So let's take a little harder look at the very concept of what we mean by happy.
*06:21.060- 06:25.720* :  Finland's title is the result of the World Happiness Report, asking people in more than
*06:25.720- 06:30.860* :  140 countries about their lives, including questions about things like social support,
*06:30.860- 06:37.520* :  healthy life expectancy, freedom, and the prevalence or otherwise of corruption, but surely
*06:37.520- 06:39.040* :  there's more to it than that.
*06:39.540- 06:44.820* :  I'm with Finnish psychologist Frank Martela, who specialises in well-being and happiness.
*06:44.820- 06:48.940* :  We are in a sunny park in Helsinki, very nice to meet you Frank.
*06:49.600- 06:50.920* :  What does happy mean?
*06:51.420- 06:55.780* :  Two main things that it can mean is one of them is like these positive emotions, like joyfulness,
*06:55.780- 06:58.280* :  cheerfulness, smiling, laughing, stuff like that.
*06:58.880- 07:02.940* :  Then the other meaning is usually about this more contentment with life, like life satisfaction.
*07:03.840- 07:06.980* :  And actually what this World Happiness Report is measuring is the latter one.
*07:07.020- 07:11.700* :  So they're measuring like think about your life from a scale from zero to ten, and then
*07:11.700- 07:13.380* :  they calculate averages for every country.
*07:13.700- 07:20.220* :  So how much is happiness about choices that are made, things that we don't have any control
*07:20.220- 07:22.140* :  over, and how much is it about choice?
*07:22.800- 07:26.440* :  How do you feel about your own life is quite much influenced by the external factors.
*07:26.840- 07:30.520* :  It's easier to be happy in a country like Finland, where the basic security is quite
*07:32.080- 07:32.100* :  good.
*07:32.100- 07:34.380* :  You don't have to worry about getting food on the table and stuff like that, so in that
*07:34.380- 07:36.680* :  sense the external factors play a key role.
*07:36.980- 07:39.480* :  Do you think that Finland is the happiest country in the world?
*07:39.480- 07:43.100* :  I think it's a country where there's like most people who are like, you know, satisfied
*07:43.100- 07:43.960* :  with their lives.
*07:44.280- 07:48.020* :  And it's more about like the fact that there's like less extremely unsatisfied people
*07:48.020- 07:51.920* :  in Finland than that there will be like more extremely satisfied people in Finland.
*07:51.920- 07:55.980* :  So the average goes up because the government is able to take care of the citizens quite
*07:55.980- 08:00.300* :  well, so it's not about, you know, extreme happiness, but it's more about, you know, less
*08:00.580- 08:01.780* :  extremely miserable people.
*08:02.320- 08:07.820* :  Is there anything though about the finished psyche that lends itself to contentment?
*08:08.160- 08:11.700* :  In fact, there are about Finland and other Nordic countries that people tend to trust each
*08:11.740- 08:12.580* :  other quite much.
*08:12.820- 08:16.760* :  People trust the institutions they trust each other, and that has been shown that, you
*08:16.760- 08:20.320* :  know, those countries where people trust each other tend to be countries where people are
*08:20.320- 08:21.620* :  happier than other countries.
*08:22.020- 08:25.020* :  A lot of people talk about the idea of pursuing happiness.
*08:25.140- 08:26.240* :  Can we pursue it?
*08:26.700- 08:30.940* :  We can't pursue it, but like usually we pursue it from the wrong places and usually actually
*08:30.940- 08:35.460* :  that doesn't make us happier, so it's a good goal for the nations to try to make citizens
*08:35.460- 08:40.740* :  as happy, but the individual should be rather concentrating on expressing themselves, caring
*08:40.740- 08:44.140* :  about their loved ones, you know, doing good things to other people, and when they do
*08:44.140- 08:47.800* :  it, do that things like that, tend to happiness comes kind of like as a side product.
*08:48.460- 08:53.180* :  But like focusing too much on your own happiness usually is a reason for misery and less happiness
*08:53.660- 08:53.680* :  actually.
*08:54.140- 08:59.560* :  Do you have any advice for a global audience on how they can discover their inner fin,
*09:01.420- 09:05.140* :  the sort of person who can find contentment in this more of things?
*09:05.600- 09:10.000* :  It starts with like, you know, not caring too much about like other people's opinions
*09:10.000- 09:13.420* :  or too much about like this materialistic success because those kind of things usually
*09:13.680- 09:14.960* :  are not something that make us happy.
*09:15.220- 09:19.080* :  So the more you compare yourself with the neighbor, the harder it's to become happy,
*09:19.340- 09:23.280* :  considering the things that you are interested in, you value, and don't care about how you
*09:23.380- 09:24.360* :  appear in the eyes of others.
*09:24.720- 09:29.640* :  Thank you, Professor Frank Martella, and now from the heart of Helsinki, to somewhere
*09:29.640- 09:30.960* :  all together more tranquil.
*09:37.360- 09:42.860* :  I'm here on the island of Vartiosari, southeast of Helsinki, looking out over the water,
*09:43.280- 09:48.420* :  and listening to the birds and the breeze in the trees, and in the dapples unshine, on
*09:48.420- 09:53.400* :  the forest floor around us, lots and lots of tiny little white flowers, lily of the
*09:53.400- 09:54.860* :  valley growing abundantly.
*09:55.220- 09:58.620* :  I'm here to meet Happiness Hacker, Adele Pionon.
*09:58.880- 10:03.320* :  She's a true champion of the natural world, she's a biologist, a writer, and she's an
*10:03.320- 10:05.180* :  advocate of well-being through nature.
*10:05.720- 10:06.200* :  Let's meet her.
*10:12.300- 10:20.200* :  We took a ferry here, so after the crossing this short water, it's already the feeling here
*10:20.200- 10:25.520* :  is, like you would be somewhere very far in the countryside, and we have a sound of
*10:25.580- 10:32.540* :  uspentry shivering in a small wind, in the birds' usaming, and nature is somehow at its
*10:32.620- 10:32.820* :  full.
*10:34.320- 10:39.100* :  Why is it that this sort of environment is so good for our happiness?
*10:40.420- 10:44.220* :  Well, this is a natural place for us to be.
*10:44.220- 10:49.700* :  It's kind of like a sign for our system that everything is alright, and this kind of
*10:50.060- 10:58.020* :  modern way of living in squirt boxes and being 90% at least time inside, it's not natural
*10:58.020- 11:04.660* :  for us, so stepping outside is for our being and mind and body like a signal of rest.
*11:06.480- 11:09.980* :  You can see how people could relax and feel happy here.
*11:10.840- 11:16.220* :  As you've said, the world is becoming increasingly urbanised, a lot of people live in very concrete
*11:16.300- 11:18.380* :  rich environments, shall we say.
*11:19.180- 11:24.080* :  What would you offer to them to help them stay connected with nature?
*11:25.300- 11:27.260* :  Well, we have nature everywhere.
*11:27.260- 11:31.720* :  It's even in the most urban places when you open your eyes for it.
*11:32.220- 11:38.580* :  For me personally, I have an audio of my forest prouc near to a place where I live, and
*11:38.580- 11:43.560* :  I like to go to listen to this prouc alive very much, but in the wintertime when it's
*11:43.560- 11:49.020* :  under the ice cover, and also when I'm not able to get there, I have a recording of it,
*11:49.040- 11:53.960* :  and I have found that it's actually surprisingly real, as I feel right away refreshed.
*11:59.680- 12:04.720* :  You can also bring natural elements to your home and inside, and this is the case for many
*12:04.720- 12:07.660* :  people who actually cannot for the moment go out.
*12:08.320- 12:13.980* :  For instance, once I had a student who told me a story of her long illness, long period
*12:13.980- 12:22.320* :  that she just had to lay on her bed for many months, and she had a piece of pine tree bark
*12:22.740- 12:28.740* :  beside her bed, and she was touching it and just keeping it in her hand, and with this
*12:28.740- 12:34.800* :  little piece of nature, she had remembering of hope, like she will manage, and she did.
*12:35.340- 12:40.120* :  Now, you are one of the happiness hackers, how would you describe your hack?
*12:40.140- 12:41.160* :  What are you doing?
*12:42.140- 12:47.940* :  We experience nature in different ways, but one of the hacks is just getting out, not
*12:48.240- 12:53.840* :  doing anything very special, just getting out, and this is very finishing, and we don't
*12:53.840- 12:58.660* :  often do very complicated things, and this is one of my hacks, it's just to get out
*12:58.720- 13:00.960* :  and be there and feel the connection.
*13:01.580- 13:05.160* :  And now we are some of the things what we do.
*13:05.360- 13:11.340* :  Well, Adela is sharing some of that expertise and wisdom now on a nature walk with happiness
*13:11.540- 13:13.060* :  seekers from around the world.
*13:13.060- 13:21.980* :  I'm from Manhattan, and I find the nature in Central Park, but it's not interesting.
*13:24.320- 13:30.060* :  They're breathing in the cleaner, learning about how fins are outside people all year round,
*13:31.060- 13:36.320* :  and right now, everyone has just taken off their sensible walking shoes and socks, and
*13:36.320- 13:38.740* :  they're collecting with the bedrock by the water.
*13:48.560- 13:48.660* :  It's not cold at all.
*13:48.700- 13:50.020* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*13:50.740- 13:55.720* :  I think I'll smile more, stop to say hello to people, tell people how great they are,
*13:55.980- 13:58.580* :  and not just keep everything in your own heart.
*13:59.000- 14:01.980* :  What the participants are getting out of a masterclass in happiness.
*14:11.880- 14:12.580* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*14:12.580- 14:17.300* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*14:17.300- 14:18.660* :  prices due to inflation.
*14:19.000- 14:19.660* :  They said yes.
*14:20.120- 14:24.080* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those honorists to your contracts,
*14:24.080- 14:26.440* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*14:26.440- 14:28.040* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*14:28.320- 14:33.420* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a
*14:34.820- 14:34.840* :  month.

*15:24.580- 15:29.720* :  Indeed, in the interests of balance, we have been talking to Harry Peltola, the mayor
*15:29.720- 15:34.700* :  of Paul Anker, a place that rejoices, if that's the right term, in its reputation as
*15:34.700- 15:36.440* :  Finland's most pessimistic place.
*15:37.140- 15:43.080* :  The city is pessimistic because it's finished a characteristic, but I think pessimism
*15:43.120- 15:50.260* :  appears as a basic character trait, but instead of despair, the emphasis is on preparing
*15:50.260- 15:53.040* :  for everything, including adversity.
*15:53.740- 15:57.500* :  It's quite good for us, but not for everyone, I think.
*15:58.680- 16:04.740* :  That's all Finns saying that the pessimist will never be disappointed, reflects a co-beings
*16:04.740- 16:10.240* :  strategy that some Finns use to deal with adversity and uncertainty.
*16:11.460- 16:19.100* :  By lowering their expectations and preparing for a worst way of being frustrated or are
*16:19.100- 16:25.180* :  prepared for negative outcomes, to be prepared for everything doesn't exclude happiness.
*16:25.900- 16:29.660* :  I think I can be happy even I think sometimes pessimistic way.
*16:30.200- 16:36.240* :  I hope they are not pessimistic at all, they are prepared for everything.
*16:37.040- 16:39.860* :  Me Harry Peltola, now are you hungry?
*16:44.300- 16:49.100* :  Luca Balach is a man who believes that happiness is food and food is happiness, the gathering
*16:49.100- 16:51.980* :  of ingredients, the cooking, the sharing and the eating of it.
*16:52.240- 16:54.280* :  He is a culinary trailblazer.
*16:54.500- 16:58.860* :  He came to prominence with three restaurants, including El, the one we're in now, committed
*16:58.860- 17:00.940* :  to sustainability and cutting waste.
*17:01.280- 17:06.680* :  He invited the happy pods Chivon and Anna to join him in the Huckian name Food Hall, where
*17:06.680- 17:11.600* :  he told them about spreading joy with food and his inspiration as a little boy in Serbia.
*17:14.700- 17:18.760* :  I think I was like three or four years old when I realized what I'm eating and how much
*17:18.760- 17:21.700* :  I enjoy and I learned to cook next to my grandma.
*17:22.280- 17:27.240* :  As a family we had this Sunday lunch concept, it was a secret and my grandma would cook
*17:27.340- 17:28.000* :  for the whole family.
*17:28.860- 17:32.120* :  Making people happy around one day but we have a huge power in our hands.
*17:32.480- 17:36.580* :  We're in charge of people's happiness for two hours or three hours.
*17:37.060- 17:41.200* :  When you make people sit around one day, people get along much better.
*17:42.020- 17:44.620* :  I wanted your grandma make a few careers, you know, success.
*17:45.540- 17:47.460* :  She was very proud of me, whatever I would do.
*17:48.440- 17:52.260* :  Well, she was in her 90s, I made her right by hand all her recipes.
*17:52.980- 17:55.660* :  So I have her kind of with me still.
*17:56.480- 17:58.080* :  And they're like stories, they're not recipes.
*17:58.540- 18:01.720* :  Is there a particular meal from your grandma or from your childhood that you still make
*18:01.740- 18:02.000* :  now?
*18:02.420- 18:05.340* :  I definitely have one dish that I inherited.
*18:05.340- 18:09.760* :  It's called Sarmar, sour cabbage filled with minced meat and rice.
*18:10.440- 18:14.200* :  It's cooked slowly with a lot of smoked meat on the top, but I need to make it.
*18:14.200- 18:18.500* :  I cannot give anyone else to make it because I don't have a recipe, the recipe is in the
*18:18.500- 18:19.440* :  touch, in a field.
*18:20.000- 18:23.420* :  What about those of us that are just sitting around the table and just eating the food?
*18:23.540- 18:25.100* :  What hacks do you have for us?
*18:25.340- 18:28.620* :  We present around and spend the time with your loved ones.
*18:28.840- 18:32.620* :  I think happiness for me is something that's radiant so you get it from other people.
*18:32.620- 18:38.520* :  So enjoying the moments, you never know what happened next life is there so we should
*18:38.520- 18:38.980* :  live it.
*18:39.260- 18:43.600* :  Well, it's just one finished dish or pastry that makes you happy.
*18:44.060- 18:48.820* :  It's a carrillion pie so it's a very special thing here that it's a pastry that has a
*18:48.840- 18:54.840* :  rye pie crust filled with the rice filling and then the best service is warm and then there
*18:54.840- 18:58.200* :  is a kind of cooked egg and butter topping on the top.
*18:58.420- 19:03.320* :  And the most amazing part is like it's one of the most affordable and most used foods
*19:03.460- 19:03.680* :  around.
*19:04.040- 19:07.720* :  All the kids grew up on this and I think it can be made super nice.
*19:08.040- 19:08.680* :  And it makes you happy?
*19:09.080- 19:12.240* :  Yeah, the egg butter and the top is making me very happy.
*19:13.480- 19:16.400* :  And that was Luca Balach at Restaurant Elm.
*19:16.760- 19:21.980* :  Now you can't come to Finland without talking about saunas and tapio hackanen loves the
*19:21.980- 19:22.320* :  saunas.
*19:22.760- 19:25.400* :  He's also though known as DJ Okadea.
*19:27.480- 19:32.840* :  An innovator in the Finnish DJ and club culture he has a decades long career that's taken
*19:32.840- 19:38.380* :  him across six continents playing to huge crowds but his happiness hack at this event
*19:38.420- 19:42.880* :  is a little bit different and we will get onto that in just a minute but first of all
*19:43.720- 19:47.160* :  what do you think that club culture does for people's happiness?
*19:48.120- 19:52.880* :  I believe that dancing in itself it connects you with the moment.
*19:55.500- 19:59.480* :  When you're dancing you're not thinking about your worries so I kind of look into that
*19:59.480- 20:05.800* :  moment so dancing itself is great and then doing it together like in raves when you kind
*20:05.800- 20:11.080* :  of you feed energy into other people and you get the energy and then you create a moment
*20:11.920- 20:16.420* :  it does great things for people's happiness just dance and dance with other people.
*20:22.120- 20:24.880* :  Dance music is all about tension and release.
*20:25.300- 20:32.060* :  Sometimes the tension is break down and the build up takes half a minute or a minute and
*20:32.060- 20:36.960* :  everyone knows that there's a moment coming and the excitement is raising and then the
*20:37.020- 20:40.920* :  moment when people are throwing their hands in the air and start whistling and shouting
*20:40.920- 20:46.620* :  and then when the beat finally drops and the euphoria takes everyone up and and together
*20:46.620- 20:48.940* :  and then it just goes like WHAAAA!
*20:53.220- 20:57.800* :  You're not just a DJ of course you are a Finnish DJ and Finnish people love a sauna.
*20:58.080- 20:59.100* :  Tell us about your hack.
*21:00.300- 21:06.060* :  Yes my hack contains a couple of my favourite things so I love sauna.
*21:06.700- 21:13.060* :  A nice Finnish form of meditation it can be a moment just with yourself and your thoughts
*21:13.660- 21:20.560* :  or it can be with your closest friends dancing is another thing and nature Finnish people
*21:20.560- 21:26.880* :  have a special connection with nature and my hack today combines all of these so we go
*21:26.880- 21:33.720* :  to a floating sauna so there's a big sauna floating on the Baltic Sea and we have DJ setup
*21:33.720- 21:37.500* :  there and people enjoy the sauna and the sea.
*21:37.920- 21:44.520* :  Also special thing for Finns the water is usually quite cold and back to the sauna and
*21:44.520- 21:50.220* :  back there and back to the sauna and the euphoric feeling gives you in that moment and afterwards
*21:50.220- 21:53.900* :  the relaxed feeling is just out of this world.
*21:54.440- 22:01.300* :  So basically my hack today combines sauna dancing, nature, friends music.
*22:01.960- 22:06.280* :  Thank you very much DJ Orkidea and we will have more of your music before the end of the
*22:10.240- 22:10.260* :  podcast.
*22:10.320- 22:16.940* :  In a world dominated by screens designer Tero Kyrtonon is on a mission to champion hands-on
*22:17.520- 22:17.540* :  creation.
*22:17.980- 22:22.620* :  His own designs are an invitation to engage our sense of touch and feel the world around
*22:22.620- 22:22.900* :  you.
*22:23.260- 22:27.420* :  He is one of the happiness hackers and we have come to meet him in a bright sunny airy
*22:27.420- 22:33.480* :  artistic space just outside the city of Helsinki so Tery thanks for talking to us.
*22:34.120- 22:39.280* :  Why is it that hands-on messy creativity is so important to happiness?
*22:40.480- 22:45.240* :  I think definitely for me at least has been always so important because I love to do things
*22:45.240- 22:50.600* :  with my hands and be creative and I was raised in the bakery so I was always decorating
*22:50.600- 22:55.820* :  donuts and so forth and I think definitely in the modern days it's so important because
*22:55.820- 23:00.600* :  we are with the phone all the time we are with the screens and I think because our hands
*23:00.900- 23:07.680* :  are tools they are built to make things originally so I think there is like a need for us to
*23:07.680- 23:12.400* :  actually do with things with our hands and be creative and I think in the modern days
*23:12.400- 23:14.380* :  it has been lost in some point.
*23:14.920- 23:16.680* :  And where does your inspiration come from?
*23:16.680- 23:18.440* :  You mentioned your parents in their bakery.
*23:19.140- 23:24.900* :  Yeah that's definitely one inspiration but I think I'm all about joy in their works.
*23:25.000- 23:32.100* :  So my aim is to bring joy to people so if I can make somebody smile with my kind of
*23:32.380- 23:35.600* :  smiling sausages that is kind of my most popular thing.
*23:36.060- 23:38.580* :  There are people around the world listening, we've got a global audience.
*23:39.140- 23:44.660* :  What would you say to people who have not done anything messily creative since they left
*23:44.680- 23:44.960* :  school?
*23:45.760- 23:47.060* :  Oh you have to do it.
*23:47.560- 23:51.620* :  The creative part that you are actually producing something and you have an idea what
*23:51.620- 23:54.740* :  you want to do and then you do it and I think that's so fulfilling.
*23:55.120- 23:58.320* :  Yeah a lot of people think oh well I'm not that artistic I can't.
*23:58.740- 24:01.080* :  No that's wrong that we have to forget.
*24:01.460- 24:05.480* :  The creative part that you are actually producing something and you have an idea what
*24:05.480- 24:09.920* :  you want to do and then you do it and I think that's so fulfilling that then you will have
*24:09.920- 24:16.420* :  the kind of final thing it can be like loaf of bread or a pair of socks or then ceramics
*24:16.480- 24:21.300* :  so that's I think the main idea being creative in somehow and don't be afraid of doing
*24:21.300- 24:23.500* :  it wrong because there is no wrong way to do it.
*24:23.800- 24:28.220* :  You have a class of people coming to seek happiness with you any minute now.
*24:28.260- 24:29.600* :  What will you be doing with them?
*24:29.900- 24:33.840* :  So we are actually doing this kind of ceramic plates that we are going to then decorate
*24:33.840- 24:35.840* :  with this kind of scruffy technique.
*24:36.620- 24:39.780* :  So the point is just to do something fun and be creative.
*24:40.380- 24:40.580* :  Ah!
*24:41.220- 24:42.140* :  That's so fun.
*24:42.260- 24:42.940* :  I'm so excited.
*24:43.300- 24:43.660* :  I'm excited.
*24:46.160- 24:46.220* :  I'm excited.
*24:46.220- 24:46.880* :  I'm excited.
*24:46.880- 24:47.320* :  Yeah yeah.
*24:47.500- 24:50.040* :  It's so much easier than it actually is.
*24:50.580- 24:56.800* :  So we're in the workspace now and the participant's creativity is in full flow.
*24:57.320- 25:01.500* :  They are crafting plates and they are concentrating.
*25:01.500- 25:02.640* :  They are focused.
*25:03.320- 25:07.080* :  They're also laughing quite a lot and they seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves.
*25:07.640- 25:11.080* :  That noise you can hear by the way, that's a hair dryer, someone's using a hair dryer
*25:11.200- 25:11.880* :  to dry their plate.
*25:12.540- 25:14.560* :  Do you know that's helping me in the end, breads?
*25:15.380- 25:15.680* :  Yes.
*25:15.680- 25:17.820* :  It's always very much like baking.
*25:18.780- 25:19.080* :  I know.
*25:19.660- 25:23.980* :  Well, since this is the last day, we thought this was the perfect opportunity to ask some
*25:24.020- 25:28.520* :  of the participants what they have thought of their experience here in Finland.
*25:28.980- 25:32.780* :  The one thing that they did all say was how much they like breakfast in Finland.
*25:32.900- 25:34.560* :  Finland does excellent breakfast.
*25:35.100- 25:38.920* :  Anyway, having established that, let's let Ben tell you the rest of it.
*25:39.160- 25:43.800* :  My name is Joplin James Sal and I am from Northburg and New Jersey in the United States.
*25:44.420- 25:46.140* :  The hack is there is no hack.
*25:46.140- 25:51.820* :  Happiness is all around you and all you have to do is look and you can find it in your
*25:51.960- 25:54.140* :  food, in your home, in nature.
*25:54.440- 25:55.540* :  That's where happiness is.
*25:55.700- 25:56.640* :  It's right in front of you.
*25:56.700- 25:57.100* :  Surprise.
*25:57.640- 25:58.020* :  It's there.
*26:00.300- 26:01.280* :  My name is Henrique.
*26:01.280- 26:04.320* :  I go by Rick and I'm from Sampaldo, Brazil.
*26:04.980- 26:10.100* :  When I saw in the news that Finland was the happiest country in the world, I got so curious
*26:10.100- 26:12.680* :  about it that I have to apply for that.
*26:12.820- 26:18.440* :  I know that Brazil is known for being an outgoing country but at the same time, I wanted
*26:18.440- 26:20.380* :  to learn what we were missing there.
*26:20.640- 26:26.340* :  I think, for example, when we arrived, I wasn't expecting to do so many simple activities
*26:26.340- 26:28.280* :  that I could actually do it back home.
*26:28.660- 26:33.740* :  A moment that got me really emotional was the one when we went to an island and we walked
*26:33.740- 26:39.640* :  barefoot on a rock and you can see the simplicity of it and knowing that I can take it back home
*26:39.640- 26:41.640* :  and also teach people to do so.
*26:42.020- 26:43.240* :  My name is Ginny Bartolome.
*26:43.320- 26:44.380* :  I'm from New York City.
*26:44.380- 26:45.140* :  We live in Manhattan.
*26:45.640- 26:50.060* :  I think I was hoping to get a better idea of what they meant by the happiest country
*26:50.060- 26:55.020* :  in the world because you always hear that and in the United States, we have such an interesting
*26:55.020- 27:00.160* :  view of the word happy that it's always energetic and it's extroverted and it's always bubbly
*27:00.300- 27:03.260* :  and that's actually not who I am at all.
*27:03.260- 27:04.680* :  I tend to be pretty introverted.
*27:05.180- 27:09.680* :  They talk so much about how people in Finland don't like small talk but the conversations
*27:09.680- 27:15.800* :  I have had have actually been very, very warm so allowing myself, maybe, to be quieter
*27:16.200- 27:21.160* :  and calmer even in New York City, maybe I'll be able to adopt some of the Finnish happy
*27:21.160- 27:22.740* :  energy because of that.
*27:24.120- 27:24.580* :  I'm Dani.
*27:24.800- 27:25.680* :  I come from Spain.
*27:25.680- 27:32.540* :  We were learning how to skateboard or doing graffiti and we were like, why we are not
*27:32.540- 27:35.480* :  doing this every week is so much fun.
*27:35.960- 27:42.280* :  Let's gather some friends, go to some walls that we can paint so walls that we are allowed
*27:42.280- 27:48.180* :  to paint and by only like two colors and make a graffiti, it's going to be fun.
*27:48.700- 27:51.920* :  So we are going to remember this forever.
*27:52.460- 27:55.380* :  This experience has us putting our hearts.
*27:56.440- 28:00.940* :  My name is Ruti and I'm originally from India but I'm living in London.
*28:01.420- 28:07.460* :  I think I'll stop a little bit more to enjoy the nature, not just to take photos but
*28:07.460- 28:14.080* :  just to stand in the sun, look at the leaves here and smile more, stop to say hello to
*28:14.100- 28:20.300* :  people, compliment people, tell people how great they are and not just keep everything
*28:20.580- 28:21.380* :  in your own heart.
*28:22.400- 28:26.640* :  Voices of some happiness seekers who seem to have found what they were looking for.
*28:27.240- 28:29.320* :  Now are you ready for some more DJ or cadet?
*28:35.600- 28:38.360* :  That's it from this happy pod road trip to Helsinki.
*28:38.800- 28:41.620* :  Normal happy pod service will be resumed next week.
*28:42.120- 28:44.160* :  This edition was mixed by Anna Murphy.
*28:44.160- 28:47.380* :  The producers were Shavorn Leighy, Anna Murphy and Holly Gibbs.
*28:47.660- 28:49.120* :  Our editor is Karen Martin.
*28:49.120- 28:53.320* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and as they say in Finland, Kitos, Yamoy moy.
*29:02.580- 29:06.400* :  Gail Katz told friends she was leaving her husband Bob, then went missing.
*29:06.400- 29:11.400* :  On season one of the girlfriends, Bob's ex-girlfriends came together to bring him down and seek
*29:11.420- 29:11.900* :  justice.
