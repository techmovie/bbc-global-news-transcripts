*01:20.960- 01:24.600* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.780- 01:31.380* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Saturday, the 8th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:31.960- 01:37.020* :  Israel reacts with fury to a plan to put its army on the UN's official list of organizations
*01:37.020- 01:43.180* :  that harmed children in conflict zones. President Biden has spoken in defense of democracy and
*01:43.180- 01:49.200* :  against isolationism on the site of an Nazi stronghold stormed by American troops on D-Day.
*01:49.200- 01:55.320* :  And Russia's president Vladimir Putin says he doesn't rule out changing Russia's nuclear doctrine
*01:55.320- 02:01.480* :  if he felt the country is threatened. This doctrine is a living instrument and we watch
*02:01.480- 02:08.080* :  closely what is happening in the world and around us. We don't exclude making some changes.
*02:10.700- 02:14.540* :  Also in this podcast, even having gone through a lot of stuff in my life so far,
*02:15.080- 02:19.420* :  having to sit for the college entrance examination, also known as Galkal, remains one of the most
*02:19.420- 02:24.760* :  stressful or even borderline traumatizing experiences in my life. Over 13 million students in China
*02:24.760- 02:32.700* :  are gearing up for the big end of high school exams. Israel appears to have joined a list which
*02:32.700- 02:39.040* :  in the past has included Afghanistan, Syria and extremist groups such as Islamic State and
*02:39.040- 02:45.260* :  Boko Haram. Israel says the UN has included the Israeli army on an annual blacklist of countries
*02:45.260- 02:50.600* :  and organizations which harmed children in conflict zones. The list is due to be released next week.
*02:50.600- 02:57.740* :  Diplomatic sources say that Islamic jihad and Hamas were also going to be on the UN blacklist.
*02:58.180- 03:03.620* :  The Israeli government has reacted with fury. Here's Gilad Erdan, Israel's envoy to the United
*03:03.620- 03:10.480* :  Nations. I am utterly shocked and disgusted by this shameful decision of the Secretary-General.
*03:11.180- 03:18.340* :  Israel's army is the most moral army in the world. So this immoral decision will only aid the
*03:18.340- 03:24.660* :  terrorists and reward Hamas. Hugo Bashega, our correspondent in Jerusalem, has more details.
*03:25.540- 03:30.480* :  Thousands of children have been killed in Israel's war against Hamas and Gaza and thousands more
*03:30.480- 03:37.640* :  are in desperate need of humanitarian help. Now this annual list by the UN Secretary-General covers
*03:37.640- 03:44.020* :  the killing of children in conflict and also the denial of access to aid and the targeting of
*03:44.020- 03:49.740* :  schools and hospitals. It's still not clear what accusations the Israeli military is facing,
*03:49.740- 03:55.600* :  but this decision, if it's taken, will put more pressure on the country's authorities. And
*03:55.600- 04:01.540* :  unsurprisingly, there's been strong reaction from Israeli officials, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*04:01.540- 04:07.460* :  said the UN had added itself to the blacklist of history and again he said the Israeli military
*04:07.460- 04:13.320* :  was the most moral army in the world. Now the Israeli foreign minister said this decision would
*04:13.320- 04:18.640* :  have an impact on the country's relations with the United Nations. Now there have been reports
*04:18.640- 04:24.740* :  suggesting that both Hamas and Islamic jihad will also be added to the list and there has been
*04:24.740- 04:31.020* :  reaction from the Palestinians as well. A spokesman for the Palestinian president told the writer's
*04:31.020- 04:37.300* :  news agency that this decision was a step closer to holding Israel accountable for its crimes.
*04:37.780- 04:42.720* :  Now in another development, Anthony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, is returning to the
*04:42.720- 04:48.560* :  Middle East. He will be in the region next week. He will be visiting Egypt, Israel, Jordan,
*04:48.560- 04:55.240* :  and Qatar to put pressure on both Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza.
*04:55.540- 05:00.360* :  They have been talks in recent days, but there has been no breakthrough in these negotiations.
*05:00.540- 05:06.780* :  Now a President Biden last week announced this proposal. He described it as an Israeli proposal
*05:06.780- 05:13.180* :  that would see the release of hostages being held in Gaza and paved the way for a permanent
*05:13.180- 05:19.200* :  ceasefire in Gaza, a key Hamas demand, but a divisive issue in Israel.
*05:19.640- 05:25.660* :  Here you go, Bashaegar, in Jerusalem. Against the backdrop of a pure blue sea and sky,
*05:25.660- 05:30.720* :  President Biden has made an emotional plea to the American people to follow the example of the
*05:30.720- 05:35.940* :  soldiers who fought in the Second World War and look out to the world rather than isolate themselves
*05:35.940- 05:41.500* :  from the international disorder of the 21st century. He was speaking at Pont Duoc,
*05:41.500- 05:48.420* :  where US Army Rangers scaled a 35-meter cliff in Normandy on D-Day to seize Nazi artillery.
*05:48.420- 05:53.380* :  Mr. Biden standing in front of the memorial which commemorates the decisive battle
*05:53.380- 05:58.660* :  said that America remains pivotal to world order as it did in 1944.
*05:59.240- 06:05.420* :  I refuse to believe. I simply refuse to believe that America's greatness is the thing of the past.
*06:06.560- 06:11.220* :  I still believe there's nothing beyond our capacity in America when we act together.
*06:13.200- 06:18.280* :  For the fortunate heirs of the legacy of these heroes, those who scaled the cliffs
*06:19.000- 06:24.500* :  point to hawk, but there's also the keepers of their mission, the keepers of their mission,
*06:25.760- 06:32.220* :  the bearers of the flame of freedom that they kept burning bright, that is the truest
*06:32.220- 06:38.700* :  testimonial through their lives. Our actions every day to ensure that our democracy endures
*06:39.440- 06:44.220* :  and the soul our nation endures. President Biden said the American soldiers who fought in
*06:44.220- 06:49.360* :  Europe would recognize the war being fought in Ukraine. They stood against Hitler's aggression.
*06:50.560- 06:56.200* :  Does anyone doubt that they would want America to stand up against Putin's aggression here in
*06:56.200- 07:03.940* :  Europe today? They stormed the beaches alongside their allies. Does anyone believe these Rangers
*07:04.460- 07:06.680* :  want America to go alone today?
*07:07.980- 07:13.160* :  Although he never mentioned his name, Mr. Biden seemed to have Donald Trump in his sights.
*07:13.600- 07:19.540* :  On a June day, 40 years ago, another US president, Ronald Reagan spoke at Pont-Dock,
*07:19.860- 07:24.000* :  using the battle to in support back home for his foreign policy agenda.
*07:24.320- 07:29.040* :  So how did Mr. Biden do? Husekofield is our correspondent in Paris.
*07:29.740- 07:34.520* :  In the first half of the speech, it's that same as Reagan. He was talking about the men and
*07:34.520- 07:41.180* :  naming some of the men, the Rangers who scaled the cliffs came up and saying they did it for a great
*07:41.180- 07:47.460* :  cause. That cause is still alive. The fight against totalitarianism, again, it's Russia,
*07:48.020- 07:52.780* :  and he's saying again, like Reagan did, you know, that this should inspire the new generations.
*07:53.340- 07:56.860* :  Who would believe, he said it over and over again, who would believe that the Rangers who
*07:56.860- 08:04.020* :  fought here would not do everything in their power to turn back the tide of hateful ideologies
*08:04.020- 08:09.840* :  and so on. So exactly the same way as Reagan, he's drawing on that imagery, that heroic memory,
*08:09.840- 08:15.140* :  which is, you know, very, very strongly inculcated in the American minds. You know, the Pont-Dock
*08:15.140- 08:20.020* :  is the key moment of the day for them and trying to drop a sort of moral message for today.
*08:20.320- 08:26.400* :  So open criticism of Vladimir Putin, but how much all service was criticism of Donald Trump?
*08:26.620- 08:30.140* :  I've no doubt at all that it was all intended for a domestic audience, but the way it was
*08:30.140- 08:37.160* :  stage managed with music, with a wonderful backdrop of the channel, handshakes of the veterans,
*08:37.160- 08:42.880* :  and then the content, you know, implicitly, I think it all was tack on Donald Trump.
*08:42.880- 08:47.540* :  We didn't once mention Donald Trump's name. I think that would have been seen as out of
*08:47.540- 08:53.260* :  place going too far. This is a foreign policy speech, but the underlying message was clearly that,
*08:53.320- 08:58.120* :  you know, the Biden stood with the ranges for an international alliance of free nations against
*08:58.120- 09:05.280* :  authoritarianism, and that, by implication, a present Trump didn't, and it all was an implicit
*09:05.280- 09:11.320* :  criticism and attack on Donald Trump. Use go field. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin,
*09:11.320- 09:17.320* :  wasn't invited to the commemoration in Normandy. Instead, he gave a lengthy address at an
*09:17.320- 09:22.800* :  economic forum in St. Petersburg, in which he said he doesn't rule out changing Russia's nuclear
*09:22.800- 09:27.900* :  doctrine if he feels the country is threatened. Currently, the use of nuclear weapons is
*09:27.900- 09:34.080* :  theoretically allowed by the Kremlin if Russia's sovereignty or territorial integrity is under attack.
*09:34.080- 09:39.220* :  He also reserved the right to supply Russian weapons to countries hostile to the West.
*09:39.620- 09:42.440* :  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, was listening.
*09:43.120- 09:47.920* :  Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has been engaged in nuclear saber
*09:48.380- 09:53.580* :  rattling, dropping less than subtle hints to the West. It shouldn't push Russia too far.
*09:54.260- 09:59.180* :  Today, President Putin said that Russia would need to use nuclear weapons to achieve victory in
*09:59.180- 10:04.920* :  Ukraine. For a moment, he looked quite the dove, compared to the man asking him the questions
*10:04.920- 10:11.500* :  at an economic forum panel discussion. Forum policy expert Sergei Karaganov had called for a
*10:11.500- 10:21.320* :  preemptive nuclear strike on Europe, but then came a warning. Mr. Putin said that Russia's
*10:21.320- 10:26.620* :  tactical nuclear weapons were three or four times as powerful as the ones America had dropped
*10:26.620- 10:33.080* :  on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that Russia has many more of the Europe does. He described Europe
*10:33.080- 10:38.700* :  as more or less defenseless. And for the second time in a week, he said that Russia was considering
*10:38.700- 10:44.520* :  supplying other countries with conventional long-range Russian missiles that could be used to
*10:44.520- 10:51.140* :  strike Western targets. His response to NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use similar-class
*10:51.140- 10:55.840* :  Western weapons to strike Russian territory. Steve Rosenberg
*10:56.660- 11:02.820* :  It's a market that could soon be worth more than $100 billion. Diabetes and obesity drugs
*11:02.820- 11:09.080* :  like a Zempik and Wungero have become famous for helping users lose large amounts of weight.
*11:09.080- 11:15.700* :  Two companies dominate the industry, Levo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, creating something of a space race.
*11:15.940- 11:20.680* :  But with competitors desperate for a piece of the action, how long can these two giants
*11:20.680- 11:28.200* :  stay in front? Leanna Bern reports. In 2017, a new diabetes medicine hit pharmacies in the US.
*11:28.680- 11:33.040* :  Looking to get back in your Type 2 diabetes zone, once weekly ozempik can help.
*11:35.860- 11:40.720* :  It wasn't just getting control of their blood sugar, though. With this one, called ozempik,
*11:41.080- 11:45.260* :  users were losing some serious weight. The company that makes it,
*11:45.260- 11:51.040* :  Levo Nordisk, is now Europe's most valuable company. It can't keep up with demand,
*11:51.180- 11:55.720* :  and of course, its rivals are queuing up for a piece of the action.
*11:56.320- 12:00.360* :  I have struggled with my weight for many years, actually since I was a child.
*12:00.860- 12:06.180* :  Michelle Harwam lives in Denmark with her partner and three children. She started back on the
*12:06.180- 12:11.660* :  weight loss drugway govy after coming off it while pregnant. It's expensive, casting Michelle
*12:11.660- 12:18.080* :  around $200 every month. A new study has found one in eight of the world's population,
*12:18.080- 12:23.560* :  and now classed as obese. More than a billion people are classed as obese worldwide.
*12:23.820- 12:30.380* :  It's a huge market, and at the moment, drug companies are only tapping into a tiny percentage of it.
*12:30.640- 12:33.560* :  I think we inspire Novo and Novo inspires us.
*12:33.780- 12:39.300* :  That's Patrick Johnson. Eli Lilly's president of diabetes and obesity, talking to me down the line
*12:39.300- 12:45.600* :  from the company's HQ in Indianapolis. Competition just makes us better and better every day.
*12:45.820- 12:50.800* :  Something that made a lot of headlines as well as the shortage of the supply of some of these
*12:50.800- 12:55.060* :  drugs. Are you finding the same issues that you're not able to keep up with the demand?
*12:55.060- 13:00.860* :  We're moving as quickly as we can, but there are at times supply constraints in the market.
*13:01.080- 13:06.240* :  We think of it as a somewhat stable duopoly between Novo and Lilly. That's Emily Field,
*13:06.240- 13:12.820* :  head of European pharmaceuticals, equity research at Barclays. These two companies are the winners,
*13:13.700- 13:20.140* :  and everyone else is really scrambling for lack of a better word to catch up. Emily says she's
*13:20.140- 13:26.180* :  seen a recent flurry of buyouts in the pharmaceutical space, because behind Novo and Lilly,
*13:26.180- 13:30.760* :  as a long line of drug makers, keen to get a piece of the action.
*13:31.240- 13:35.880* :  It's Manoon Chakravathi. I serve as the therapeutic global head for cardiovascular,
*13:36.640- 13:38.840* :  renal, and metabolism product development at Roche.
*13:39.100- 13:43.560* :  Dr. Chakravathi used to work for the California-based biotechnology company,
*13:43.560- 13:49.620* :  Karma Therapeutics, until it was bought out in December by industry giant Roche.
*13:49.860- 13:55.660* :  Roche needed Karma's research to give it a foothold into this lucrative diet and diabetes space,
*13:55.660- 14:00.340* :  and Karma needed money and resources to develop a new drug.
*14:00.340- 14:04.100* :  We're doing everything that we can to accelerate as fast as possible,
*14:04.140- 14:06.840* :  getting ready for larger studies.
*14:07.120- 14:12.300* :  With increased competition, will that mean that the price of these weight loss drugs will come down,
*14:12.300- 14:13.840* :  because they are quite high at the moment?
*14:14.340- 14:20.460* :  Our belief is that just having just a handful of companies trying to supply the world's population
*14:20.460- 14:26.840* :  to meet the global demand is likely not sustainable, but having more could have a healthy way
*14:26.840- 14:32.060* :  to bring affordability and more importantly, better access.
*14:32.700- 14:37.980* :  Another factor that could dictate price is once Novo Nordisk's patents expire,
*14:37.980- 14:42.660* :  its monopoly is over, and that could happen as soon as 2026,
*14:42.660- 14:45.500* :  in some markets outside of Europe and the US.
*14:45.500- 14:50.080* :  At that point, other drug makers will jump in and start producing their own copies,
*14:50.080- 14:53.920* :  known as generics, and they'll, presumably, be a lot cheaper.
*14:56.520- 14:59.100* :  West Africa is blessed with natural resources,
*14:59.100- 15:05.040* :  but countries in the region for decades have tended to focus predominantly on one particular
*15:05.040- 15:11.480* :  resource. In Nigeria's case, it's oil, but there are now signs of efforts to diversify, for
*15:11.480- 15:17.600* :  example, the world's two biggest cocoa producers, Ivory Coast and Ghana, have reported a significant
*15:17.600- 15:25.380* :  increase in gold output. Before independence from Britain in 1957, Ghana was known as the gold
*15:25.380- 15:33.400* :  coast, so why is it now turning back to gold? Africa, regional editor Nick Erickson, has the answer.
*15:33.900- 15:39.180* :  The rise in gold outputs with two of West Africa's biggest economies points to a bigger story,
*15:39.180- 15:45.560* :  the crisis in regional cocoa production. West Africa in general, and Ghana and Ivory Coast
*15:45.560- 15:50.880* :  in particular, have long been synonymous with the crop that finds its way into chocolate bars
*15:50.880- 15:56.140* :  and coffee cups around the world. But a perfect storm of climate change, disease and
*15:56.140- 16:01.640* :  mismanagement has meant that there is a crisis brewing. The crop is being decimated rapidly.
*16:02.480- 16:08.340* :  Ivory Coast has recognised this and is trying to diversify its output into gold with modest success.
*16:09.000- 16:13.580* :  Ghana's slight rise in gold output also seems to be in the right direction, but it's thought
*16:13.580- 16:19.020* :  to be a small scale mining, unregulated and often dangerous, that is masking declines in the
*16:19.020- 16:24.940* :  more formalised mining sector in Ghana. This could be a new problem masquerading as a solution
*16:24.940- 16:32.160* :  to an old one. Nick Erickson. Still to come, will YouTube's new restrictions on
*16:32.160- 16:38.680* :  gun videos reduce youth violence? Social media is a bad thing, but what gets put on it,
*16:38.680- 16:43.920* :  it's done too much damage, it can't stop it. And why are scientists concerned about the
*16:43.920- 16:50.960* :  pandemic sweeping through sea urchin populations? They are like the long moors of coral reefs,
*16:51.340- 16:58.500* :  and by doing so, they allow corals to thrive and photosynthesise with sunlight.
*17:05.660- 17:10.060* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mid-Mobile. With the price of just about everything going up during inflation,
*17:10.060- 17:15.240* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,
*17:15.240- 17:18.760* :  which is apparently a thing. Mid-Mobile, unlimited, premium wireless,

*18:13.020- 18:18.380* :  One world leader has apologized for his behavior at Thursday's D-Day commemorations.
*18:18.380- 18:23.120* :  The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak left Normandy early to record a campaign
*18:23.120- 18:28.420* :  interview for the upcoming UK General Election. Mr Sunak has said, on reflection,
*18:29.260- 18:33.780* :  it has been a mistake. Opposition parties have called it a shameful dereliction of duty,
*18:34.260- 18:40.240* :  and his absence featured in a televised election debate involving leading figures from the UK's
*18:40.240- 18:45.440* :  seven main parties. Penny Mordant, a senior figure in Mr Sunak's Conservatives,
*18:46.020- 18:47.880* :  sounded more like a member of the opposition.
*18:48.460- 18:54.060* :  What happened was completely wrong, and the Prime Minister has rightly apologised for that,
*18:54.060- 19:00.060* :  apologised to veterans, but also to all of us because he was representing all of us.
*19:00.460- 19:06.020* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson watched the debate and began by telling me that the issue
*19:06.020- 19:11.020* :  of Prime Minister Sunak's blunder over the D-Day commemorations was a big talking point.
*19:11.440- 19:16.320* :  It was a huge talking point, and it was always going to be that way because it's just hard
*19:16.960- 19:23.360* :  to imagine a more inexplicable gaff own goal, whatever you would like to call it, than that committed
*19:23.360- 19:29.920* :  by the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in leaving Normandy and leaving those commemorations ahead of
*19:29.920- 19:35.800* :  other world leaders, and it is absolutely no surprise that opposition politicians have leapt
*19:35.800- 19:41.680* :  upon it. But I think there's just no secret that it's also really damaged Moral within
*19:41.680- 19:48.160* :  his own governing Conservative party. So away from that, your assessment of the debate,
*19:48.160- 19:51.900* :  the taxation, and immigration was again hotly debated.
*19:52.580- 19:57.500* :  It was, I mean, the debate in a funny sort of way, you might have thought with seven politicians,
*19:57.740- 20:03.580* :  it would be more sort of chaotic bitter than the one between Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak
*20:03.840- 20:07.520* :  last week, but it wasn't. I mean, it was a remarkably civilised affair.
*20:07.980- 20:13.480* :  I mean, in many ways, it was rather predictable. So if I just sum it up, you have to have
*20:13.480- 20:18.260* :  Penny Morden, who we've already mentioned, essentially saying, look, we've been in power for 14
*20:18.260- 20:23.800* :  years. No, it's been tough, but it's only the Conservatives who in their DNA are in favour of a
*20:23.840- 20:29.000* :  smaller state in lower taxes, where you had the main opposition Labour Party sort of saying,
*20:29.000- 20:34.240* :  look, come on, after 14 years of the sort of chaos we've had its time for change.
*20:34.780- 20:39.420* :  And the smaller parties, essentially, trying to argue, look, the two main parties are incredibly
*20:39.420- 20:44.180* :  similar. So you wouldn't see much difference. I mean, the two sort of moments that stood out for
*20:44.180- 20:49.600* :  me was when the studio audience cheered at a couple of things. They cheered at someone,
*20:49.600- 20:55.220* :  one of the Nationalist politicians saying Brexit had been a disaster, and also cheered when one
*20:55.220- 20:59.960* :  of the Nationalists, the same politician, argued that actually immigrants, migrants, are done an
*20:59.960- 21:04.820* :  awful lot for this country. Briefly, what impact might this debate have on the election?
*21:05.660- 21:11.020* :  Briefly, very little, I say that, Alex, just because everything else so far in the campaign,
*21:11.600- 21:15.340* :  and in fact, for the last few weeks and months seems to have done little to change the polls,
*21:15.340- 21:22.280* :  which has Labour comfortably out in front. Rob Watson. And this is a big year for elections
*21:22.280- 21:26.840* :  around the world, as we've just been hearing here in the UK, voters will be going to the polls
*21:26.840- 21:32.900* :  in a matter of weeks. So do you have any questions you've always wondered about? We'd love to
*21:33.200- 21:36.980* :  answer them for you. Nothing is too simple or too strange, as ever.

*21:47.740- 21:53.080* :  Following a spate of school shootings in recent years' guns, safety advocates in the US have
*21:53.080- 21:58.680* :  called on social media companies to do more to limit content that promotes gun-related violence.
*21:58.680- 22:04.460* :  This week, the video sharing platform YouTube announced new restrictions, including a ban on
*22:04.460- 22:10.840* :  any videos that demonstrate how to remove firearm safety devices, the newsrooms Ella Bicknell reports.
*22:18.020- 22:23.400* :  Videos like this one teaching people how to make their own gun are easily found on YouTube.
*22:26.140- 22:30.840* :  Alright, we got a shot. At the moment, there are no restrictions on who can watch,
*22:30.840- 22:34.960* :  but that's going to change. On Wednesday, the video sharing platform,
*22:34.960- 22:39.860* :  owned by Google, announced videos showing homemade weapons, automatic rifles and videos
*22:39.860- 22:46.980* :  promoting firearm accessories like silences, will be restricted to users 18 and older. YouTube
*22:46.980- 22:52.060* :  is also banning any videos that demonstrate how to remove firearm safety devices.
*22:58.600- 23:03.160* :  Firearms are said to be the number one cause of death for children in America.
*23:07.700- 23:13.980* :  We have to act and don't tell me we can't have an impact on this carnage.
*23:14.220- 23:19.940* :  That's President Biden speaking after a school shooting in Newvalde, Texas in May 2022,
*23:20.520- 23:25.940* :  which killed 19 children and two teachers. He called for tougher regulation on gun ownership.
*23:26.300- 23:32.400* :  The idea that the 18-year-old kid can walk into a gun store and buy two assault weapons,
*23:33.340- 23:38.640* :  it's just wrong. YouTube says these new rules are designed to reflect the growing issue of
*23:38.640- 23:44.140* :  gun violence and new issues within the debate, like 3D printed guns, which have become more
*23:44.140- 23:49.580* :  available in recent years. However, not everyone thinks it will work. Social media,
*23:49.580- 23:54.760* :  it's a bad thing, but what gets put on it, it's done too much damage, it can't stop it.
*23:55.100- 23:59.800* :  Matthew Norford is a youth worker in Manchester in the north of England. His service,
*23:59.800- 24:05.140* :  called one message, mentors young people at risk of gun and knife-related violence.
*24:05.600- 24:09.580* :  You don't have a Norford because they're infatuated by it because it's made to look cool.
*24:10.020- 24:12.920* :  Someone's going to give you your public to watch it because you've already been watching it
*24:12.920- 24:17.660* :  for the last two, three, four years. And now you've just blocked my iPad while I go to my friends,
*24:17.700- 24:21.620* :  I go to someone who I know is always going to be access to it. It's not that they're taking it
*24:21.620- 24:27.640* :  from YouTube. YouTube remains optimistic. In a statement, it said it would continue to consult
*24:27.640- 24:33.500* :  outside experts and review its guidelines to make sure the line is drawn in the right place.
*24:34.100- 24:40.960* :  Ella Bicknell. A sea urchins sharp needle spines might be a painful annoyance for sea swimmers,
*24:40.960- 24:45.400* :  but as a species, they play a crucial role in keeping coral reefs alive,
*24:45.400- 24:50.980* :  gnawing away at algae which inhibit coral's growth. However, Israeli scientists say
*24:50.980- 24:56.580* :  urchin populations in the Red Sea have been hit by a pandemic, which is now spreading to parts of
*24:56.580- 25:03.140* :  the Indian Ocean. Omri Bronstein from the University of Tel Aviv co-authored this study. He says
*25:03.140- 25:09.640* :  it could become a global problem. What is killing the sea urchins is a unicellular protozoan,
*25:09.800- 25:16.260* :  and the one that we've just identified in the Red Sea is actually identical to the one that
*25:16.260- 25:22.480* :  was earlier identified in the Caribbean, and the fact that it is the same pathogen across such a
*25:22.480- 25:28.840* :  huge geographic distance is a reason for concern. Yes, this is still a research in progress,
*25:28.840- 25:35.320* :  but we already know that the sea urchins are not recovering as a population. We don't have
*25:35.320- 25:43.320* :  Pfizer or Moderna to find cure for sick sea urchins, but what we can do is take actions and be
*25:43.320- 25:49.580* :  aware of what we're doing to this already suffering environment. For example, pumping out nutrients
*25:49.580- 25:55.740* :  that's fertilizers, which actually will boost algal growth would be the absolutely worst thing
*25:55.740- 26:01.100* :  you could do at a time like this. Omri Bronstein from the University of Tel Aviv.
*26:02.080- 26:07.660* :  Australia's first Aboriginal-owned renewable energy grid has been launched in the remote
*26:07.660- 26:14.020* :  Northern Territory community of Marlingia, the new microgrid is connected to the National
*26:14.020- 26:20.440* :  Framework, but can work independently powered by a 100 kilowatt solar array and battery.
*26:20.440- 26:25.820* :  Campaigners say it's a model that could be used in other First Nations communities.
*26:26.380- 26:28.140* :  Phil Mercer reports from Sydney.
*26:34.300- 26:40.940* :  Janie Dixon is an Aboriginal elder in Marlingia. It's a small community that sits between Darwin
*26:40.940- 26:47.560* :  and Alice Springs in Australia's rugged Northern Territory. Its residents have endured high
*26:47.560- 26:54.900* :  electricity prices and blackouts that have often lasted for weeks. The solar-powered microgrid
*26:54.900- 27:02.000* :  will give them energy self-determination. Now that we've got this solo, we don't need money.
*27:02.620- 27:07.600* :  Me and my brothers and my children are really proud what we've got in our community,
*27:07.600- 27:12.020* :  and we are so happy inside of our stomach and inside of our heart.
*27:12.280- 27:17.440* :  The Marlingia microgrid is the first project, not just in the Northern Territory or Australia,
*27:17.440- 27:21.460* :  but in the southern hemisphere, that is 100% Indigenous-owned.
*27:21.460- 27:27.980* :  Lauren Mellor is from original power. Over the past five years, the Indigenous energy charity
*27:27.980- 27:34.280* :  has worked with residents to build what should be a reliable and resilient source of electricity
*27:34.460- 27:38.520* :  in a region that has scorching summers and cold winters.
*27:39.380- 27:45.160* :  Ms Mellor believes the project that costs half a million dollars will be an inspiring blueprint
*27:45.160- 27:47.700* :  for other Aboriginal communities.
*27:48.100- 27:51.980* :  Mellor is the first community owned microgrid in the Northern Territory, but it's certainly
*27:51.980- 27:56.700* :  not going to be the last. And it's not just low cost power, it's also the benefits of training
*27:56.700- 28:01.240* :  and employment, ownership of that income stream from the generation of electricity
*28:01.240- 28:06.140* :  that Mellor residents are already saying will underpin the future of this community.
*28:06.140- 28:12.280* :  Campaigners insist that many First Nations people are being left behind in Australia's transition
*28:12.280- 28:19.740* :  to renewable energy. Putting power into the hands of Indigenous communities could be a vital step
*28:19.740- 28:27.680* :  forward. Phil Mercer. A record number of students in China are taking this year's National College
*28:27.680- 28:34.120* :  Entrance Examination, a two-day ordeal with this build as the world's largest academic test.
*28:34.440- 28:38.920* :  Catherine B. Ruhanga heard more from Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton.
*28:39.360- 28:47.800* :  13.4 million students are registered to take part in the exam. That's up half a million from last
*28:47.840- 28:53.700* :  year. Last year was another record, so it keeps growing every year. And that's because parents
*28:53.700- 29:01.060* :  aspirations for their children are growing in China. Many more parents, parents from poor families
*29:01.060- 29:07.560* :  want their children to be able to go on to higher education and to be able to attend college
*29:07.560- 29:14.420* :  in university. And Celia, we mentioned that it's been described as an ordeal. Just talk us through
*29:14.420- 29:19.220* :  what do these exams actually consist of and how important are they? Well, they're called
*29:19.220- 29:26.120* :  Destiny Changers in China. So students essentially study for 12 years in order to take this exam,
*29:26.120- 29:33.080* :  which in many parts of China takes two days. It's two eight-hour days where students will write
*29:33.080- 29:39.280* :  on everything from Chinese to English, chemistry, physics, some of the exams even stretch into
*29:39.280- 29:44.660* :  three days. Now, most students are discouraged from ever taking the exam more than once. So it
*29:44.660- 29:50.900* :  means that your score on this exam is really going to affect your life. Or that's how it's
*29:50.900- 29:56.260* :  built. It's really built up as a huge thing. Parents will accompany their children to the exams,
*29:56.300- 30:03.620* :  often wearing red, the parents wear red, because red is a lucky color. Cities really shut down when
*30:03.620- 30:10.680* :  these exams are taken place. Construction sites are meant to pause, traffic and cars are encouraged,
*30:10.680- 30:15.640* :  drivers are encouraged to stop honking their horns so that the city will become a bit quieter and
*30:15.640- 30:21.900* :  not disturb students. So this is really seen as a big deal, a passage from childhood into adulthood
*30:21.900- 30:27.920* :  once you write the exam. Sure, Nuan works for our Chinese units and he sat the exam more than a decade
*30:27.920- 30:33.460* :  ago. What was his experience? Even having gone through a lot of stuff in my life so far,
*30:34.060- 30:38.280* :  having to sit for that exam remains one of the most stressful or even borderline traumatizing
*30:38.280- 30:42.360* :  experiences in my life. The pressure began to build up quite literally the moment you enter high
*30:42.540- 30:47.120* :  school. Everything basically revolved around scoring the highest you can in that life deciding exam.
*30:48.120- 30:51.920* :  And the pressure version almost unbearable level during your senior year. I remember where
*30:51.920- 30:56.460* :  to go to school seven in the morning and just keep studying until 9pm. Go back to the dorm,
*30:56.460- 31:01.520* :  sleep, wake up and go to school at seven again. And the cycle repeats itself until you face the
*31:01.520- 31:06.400* :  day that many Chinese call the judgement day. It almost sounds religious but that just comes and
*31:06.400- 31:11.500* :  shows the pressure surrounding it. I still remember the sheer joy of freedom I felt after finishing
*31:11.500- 31:17.000* :  the last test. It even felt like we were released from prison in a way. Years later we were still
*31:17.000- 31:21.160* :  joke about having to go through that period of life together because despite all the stress and
*31:21.160- 31:26.960* :  anxiety we felt it was also a time of unparalleled camaraderie because it felt like you went through
*31:26.960- 31:35.660* :  a battle together. Sure, Nuan. And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of
*31:35.660- 31:41.160* :  the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast all the topics covered
