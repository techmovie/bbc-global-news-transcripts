*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:08.740* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.620* :  BBC World Service Podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.240- 00:17.460* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mint Mobile.
*00:17.720- 00:21.600* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring
*00:21.600- 00:22.800* :  our prices down.
*00:23.220- 00:27.020* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer, which is apparently a thing.
*00:27.020- 00:32.280* :  Mint Mobile unlimited premium wireless, heavy to get $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $20, $20, $20,

*00:46.400- 00:47.140* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:47.140- 00:51.100* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*00:51.300- 00:53.740* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:54.080- 00:58.200* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:58.200- 01:01.480* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:01.780- 01:06.080* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15
*01:06.080- 01:06.740* :  a month.

*01:19.220- 01:22.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.080- 01:29.660* :  I'm Nick Miles, and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 25th of June, these are our main stories.
*01:29.660- 01:36.240* :  Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, walks free from prison after a 14-year legal battle.
*01:36.960- 01:41.920* :  Protests are taking place across Kenya against a bill that would introduce new taxes, some
*01:41.920- 01:48.540* :  invented the Parliament buildings in Nairobi, and Israel's Supreme Court orders ultra-orthodox
*01:48.540- 01:53.220* :  Jewish religious students can no longer avoid being drafted into the military.
*01:56.120- 02:03.400* :  Also in this podcast, this is the successful completion of a 53-day mission to the moon
*02:03.400- 02:07.980* :  to collect a sample and bring it back, and this is not just any sample.
*02:08.420- 02:13.440* :  Find out why scientists are so excited by pieces of rock and dirt taken from the far
*02:13.440- 02:14.360* :  side of the moon.
*02:18.300- 02:23.360* :  For some, the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange is a hero of free speech.
*02:23.360- 02:28.560* :  To others, he's a villain who endangered the lives of soldiers around the world by exposing
*02:28.560- 02:31.280* :  secrets about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
*02:32.180- 02:36.580* :  He's been involved in a long-running saga with the United States who wanted to put him
*02:36.580- 02:42.500* :  on trial for divulging military secrets, but after a 14-year legal battle, Mr Assange
*02:42.740- 02:43.780* :  is on his way to freedom.
*02:44.120- 02:48.740* :  He's been released on bail from a British prison after reaching a plea deal that ends
*02:48.740- 02:51.800* :  his long fight against extradition to the United States.
*02:52.480- 02:57.460* :  Mr Assange is set to appear before a court in a remote U.S. Pacific territory where he's
*02:57.460- 03:00.920* :  expected to plead guilty to violating espionage law.
*03:01.360- 03:03.680* :  He's unlikely to serve further time in prison.
*03:04.380- 03:08.740* :  After his court appearance, the Australian citizen will then go on to Australia, where his
*03:08.740- 03:11.080* :  wife Stella Assange is waiting for him.
*03:11.420- 03:12.800* :  It's a whirlwind of emotions.
*03:12.900- 03:16.300* :  I mean, I'm just a related, feels like it's not real.
*03:16.300- 03:23.020* :  We weren't really sure until the last 24 hours that it was actually happening, and we were
*03:23.020- 03:29.600* :  talking about, I don't know what he needed to do when take from his cell, and I also had
*03:29.600- 03:35.180* :  to pack things up and head out to Australia 24 hours before he left.
*03:35.680- 03:40.840* :  So it's just been non-stop for the past, I think, 72 hours.
*03:41.460- 03:46.120* :  Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, says it's time for Julian Assange to return
*03:46.120- 03:46.380* :  home.
*03:46.900- 03:52.380* :  Regardless of the views that people have about Mr Assange's activities, the case has
*03:52.400- 03:53.560* :  strayed on for too long.
*03:54.280- 03:58.880* :  There's nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration, and we want him brought home
*03:58.880- 03:59.640* :  to Australia.
*03:59.980- 04:05.040* :  And we have engaged and abdicated Australia's interests using all the appropriate channels
*04:05.640- 04:11.360* :  to support a positive outcome, and I've done that since very early on in my Prime Minister
*04:11.360- 04:11.720* :  ship.
*04:12.380- 04:16.980* :  Julian Assange's standoff with the United States has never been a straightforward one.
*04:17.160- 04:22.420* :  He spent seven years taking refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and at one
*04:22.420- 04:25.960* :  point started an unlikely friendship with the actress Pamela Anderson.
*04:26.640- 04:31.000* :  My diplomatic correspondent Caroline Horny has been following this story from the beginning.
*04:31.580- 04:38.160* :  If we look at where it first began, it was 2010 when Julian Assange's WikiLeaks published
*04:38.160- 04:42.300* :  footage that showed a helicopter gunship shooting Iraqi civilians.
*04:43.600- 04:50.360* :  Now that had been obtained illegally, the US said, followed after that the biggest leak
*04:50.360- 04:52.900* :  of US military secrets in history.
*04:53.680- 04:59.900* :  So then there was an international arrest warrant in a completely separate case from Sweden.
*04:59.900- 05:02.680* :  And this is how his legal issues began.
*05:02.840- 05:07.340* :  There were two Swedish women who accused him of sexual assault.
*05:07.960- 05:10.520* :  Now he fought extradition to Sweden.
*05:10.520- 05:13.280* :  He then went into the Ecuadorian Embassy in 2012.
*05:13.280- 05:17.280* :  You may remember, there was around the clock policing at the time.
*05:17.280- 05:20.660* :  So a large cost to the British taxpayer.
*05:20.900- 05:23.420* :  Then 2019 he'd outstate his welcome.
*05:23.900- 05:30.700* :  Then the extradition from the US came in and then he spent the last five years in Belmars
*05:30.800- 05:31.120* :  Jail.
*05:31.340- 05:36.360* :  So we've been following the legal twists and turns for many years.
*05:36.360- 05:40.920* :  It's hard to believe that it's finally come to an end, but certainly it seems that a deal
*05:40.920- 05:44.460* :  we don't yet know exactly how it was reached, has been reached.
*05:44.940- 05:47.300* :  The Australians were pushing very, very hard for it.
*05:47.720- 05:52.640* :  Joe Biden said in April that he was considering dropping the prosecution.
*05:52.760- 05:56.280* :  This seems to be a compromise that suits everyone.
*05:56.640- 05:57.920* :  Julian Assange wanted to be free.
*05:57.920- 05:59.620* :  His health was failing.
*06:00.000- 06:03.460* :  The Americans probably don't want to prosecute this now.
*06:04.040- 06:05.680* :  And the Australians wanted him back.
*06:06.320- 06:07.500* :  So what happens next?
*06:07.940- 06:10.460* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Sydney, Katie Watson.
*06:11.160- 06:17.080* :  So he will attend a US court nine o'clock Australian time on Wednesday morning.
*06:17.240- 06:22.600* :  He will be attending a court in, and this is the bit of a curveball, Northern Mariana Islands
*06:22.920- 06:24.020* :  on Saipam.
*06:24.400- 06:25.880* :  And that's in the middle of Pacific.
*06:26.360- 06:27.420* :  It's US territory.
*06:27.460- 06:32.380* :  And the reason he's there is because he's nervous about going on US soil.
*06:32.820- 06:35.520* :  It's also relatively close to Australia.
*06:35.620- 06:41.760* :  And according to documents, that is where he's headed after entering into a guilty plea
*06:42.160- 06:44.600* :  in the court in Northern Mariana Islands.
*06:44.880- 06:46.540* :  Now he is an Australian citizen.
*06:46.540- 06:53.740* :  What would you say is the range of feelings regarding Julian Assange there from the military
*06:53.740- 06:55.700* :  all the way down to ordinary people?
*06:55.940- 06:58.680* :  I think Anthony Albanese has said it earlier.
*06:58.680- 07:03.820* :  And that's something that he has talked about repeatedly in the White House, on a visit
*07:03.820- 07:05.200* :  to the White House in October.
*07:05.200- 07:08.360* :  He also brought the subject of Julian Assange up.
*07:08.360- 07:14.680* :  It's taken delegations across the political spectrum going to Washington again, lobbying
*07:14.680- 07:20.520* :  with US lawmakers, the Department of Justice, to say that he needs to come back to Australia.
*07:20.520- 07:25.980* :  So I think the overwhelming feeling from the news that's come out is cautious optimism
*07:26.620- 07:29.460* :  that this is a man who has been imprisoned for a long time.
*07:30.080- 07:34.900* :  And again, regardless of whether you believe he was a journalist doing his job or whether
*07:34.900- 07:41.020* :  he was endangering lives as the US has always maintained, he needs to be back in Australia
*07:41.400- 07:42.580* :  because he's an Australian citizen.
*07:43.220- 07:43.800* :  Katie Watson.
*07:44.500- 07:46.300* :  Takenya now, where tensions are rising.
*07:50.680- 07:54.760* :  That is the sound of protesters outside Parliament buildings in Nairobi.
*07:54.760- 07:59.620* :  You can hear what appears to be shots of some kind as the police try to disperse the crowd.
*08:00.100- 08:03.540* :  The demonstrations are against tax rises being debated there today.
*08:03.540- 08:08.560* :  It is a continuation of protests that took place last week, where two people were killed
*08:08.560- 08:09.920* :  and a hundred arrested.
*08:10.500- 08:13.160* :  These protesters explained why they joined the demonstrations.
*08:14.000- 08:15.000* :  They are collecting taxes.
*08:15.100- 08:17.300* :  We ask the people of Kenya have no problem with paying taxes.
*08:17.480- 08:19.940* :  But we want to see what the value of our money is doing.
*08:19.940- 08:22.340* :  We don't want to see a poor politician.
*08:22.340- 08:26.280* :  They just worked on food the other day today is putting on a watch worth 20 million.
*08:26.700- 08:28.800* :  They're putting on shoes worth 500,000.
*08:29.140- 08:30.560* :  And the people are dying on the street.
*08:31.000- 08:32.780* :  As a country, we are not hard.
*08:32.780- 08:35.960* :  It's like we just elected leaders and they don't serve us.
*08:36.260- 08:37.920* :  They just have their own personal interest.
*08:38.120- 08:41.480* :  So our presence here is very important at this time and age
*08:41.760- 08:43.560* :  so that we can speak on behalf of our country.
*08:43.560- 08:45.020* :  We are protected by the constitution.
*08:45.020- 08:49.600* :  We have a right to pick it and we are here and we're going to speak
*08:49.600- 08:51.620* :  and speak on behalf of the young people.
*08:52.240- 08:55.760* :  A short time ago, I spoke to our correspondent in Nairobi, Mercyjima.
*08:56.400- 09:00.340* :  I am right now at a church school, the old St. Cathedral.
*09:00.340- 09:03.500* :  And it's just outside the Nairobi Central Business Districts.
*09:03.920- 09:07.900* :  And I just arrived here because there's a group of medical practitioners,
*09:07.900- 09:09.960* :  doctors that have said, tend here.
*09:09.960- 09:12.500* :  And I am seeing people being wheeled into this facility.
*09:13.060- 09:15.920* :  There's one that has just passed me right now with a gun shoot wound.
*09:16.000- 09:18.260* :  And I don't know if you can hear that, but even where I am standing,
*09:18.260- 09:22.840* :  we can hear, you know, Tegas canisters being lodged at people we have seen
*09:22.840- 09:28.100* :  and had gunshots being fired and seen several people lying down on the street
*09:28.100- 09:29.120* :  just outside parliament.
*09:29.120- 09:33.780* :  Because protesters have actually managed to bridge all the security
*09:33.780- 09:38.020* :  brackets that have been set up by the police and move the outright outside parliament
*09:38.020- 09:40.380* :  now and they are threatening to now go into parliament.
*09:40.960- 09:43.460* :  What can you see from where you are standing?
*09:43.460- 09:49.280* :  Because pictures I'm looking at show what appears to be one of the parliamentary buildings
*09:49.280- 09:50.220* :  on fire.
*09:50.660- 09:53.400* :  We are getting reports from the Royces News Agency
*09:53.400- 09:58.380* :  of the bodies of five protesters seen outside the Kenyan parliament.
*09:58.460- 10:01.720* :  It's all quite difficult to cooperate at the moment.
*10:01.720- 10:05.720* :  But from what you're saying, you are, it seems clear that the police are losing
*10:05.720- 10:10.260* :  using live fire and then at least one person at least has been injured.
*10:10.960- 10:12.620* :  Yes, the police are using live bullets.
*10:12.840- 10:16.060* :  I have been able to confirm that because we have picked and we have seen protesters
*10:16.600- 10:22.660* :  picking some, what are the, the canisters and the shells from the bullets.
*10:22.660- 10:26.920* :  And we have also seen people lying down right outside parliament.
*10:26.920- 10:30.980* :  A few minutes ago, we were at a vantage position just on the Nairobi expressway
*10:30.980- 10:33.400* :  and we could clearly see what is happening on the other side.
*10:33.400- 10:35.220* :  You can hear ambulances on the background.
*10:35.220- 10:40.440* :  These are people being ferried from the places where the gunshots are going on
*10:40.800- 10:43.820* :  into places like where I am right now, just outside town in a church where
*10:43.820- 10:44.760* :  medics have set camp.
*10:45.520- 10:47.500* :  That was Mercy Juma in Nairobi.
*10:47.500- 10:52.460* :  And within the last half hour, medics in Kenya say that several people have been
*10:52.460- 10:55.240* :  shot dead by police during those protests.
*10:56.380- 10:59.420* :  More on later editions of the global news podcast.
*11:00.760- 11:04.620* :  Now, what's many Israelis have been mobilized to serve in the armed forces
*11:04.620- 11:06.260* :  since the guards are conflict began.
*11:06.260- 11:10.880* :  There is a group who until now have been exempt from fighting ultra-orthodox
*11:10.880- 11:12.540* :  Jewish seminary students.
*11:13.220- 11:17.280* :  Now, though, the Supreme Court says they can no longer avoid being drafted
*11:17.280- 11:20.440* :  and it could have ramifications for the Israeli government.
*11:20.800- 11:22.460* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*11:22.460- 11:23.240* :  You'll end now.
*11:23.800- 11:27.000* :  In Israel, the military is often described as the people's army.
*11:27.000- 11:29.880* :  Most Israelis are required by law to serve in it.
*11:30.340- 11:34.660* :  But there's been this long time waiver really since the foundation of the
*11:34.660- 11:39.980* :  state from conscription for ultra-orthodox Jewish men who are studying
*11:39.980- 11:41.640* :  in religious seminaries.
*11:42.100- 11:44.760* :  And that has long been a point of contention.
*11:45.180- 11:48.620* :  It's become much more pressing because of the strain on the armed forces
*11:48.620- 11:51.540* :  caused by the war that's going on in Gaza.
*11:52.000- 11:55.060* :  The Court referred to that in its decision where it said basically
*11:55.060- 11:58.640* :  in this unanimous ruling that ultra-orthodox Jewish seminary students
*11:59.220- 12:00.560* :  had to be drafted to the military.
*12:01.040- 12:02.760* :  This is a landmark case.
*12:03.140- 12:07.640* :  And the justice is referred to the fact that in the midst of a grueling war,
*12:07.640- 12:11.720* :  the burden of inequality is harsher than ever and demands a solution.
*12:12.200- 12:14.820* :  And there was another line widely quoted in the Israeli media.
*12:15.220- 12:19.020* :  It said discrimination regarding the most precious thing of all life itself
*12:19.020- 12:20.380* :  is of the worst kind.
*12:20.760- 12:24.000* :  So Yuland, what are the practical implications of this in the short term?
*12:24.980- 12:26.640* :  Well, there are tens of thousands.
*12:26.800- 12:32.880* :  The data seen by the Court suggested some 63,000 Yashiva students
*12:32.960- 12:35.020* :  had been covered by this waiver.
*12:35.200- 12:40.300* :  So potentially now, many of those could be called up to serve in the army.
*12:40.300- 12:44.080* :  Of course, that will require some changes in the military itself.
*12:44.080- 12:46.940* :  There have been small numbers of ultra-orthodox men
*12:46.940- 12:50.460* :  that have been integrated in the past in special units.
*12:50.840- 12:55.700* :  They've also been a number of people who have volunteered to be conscripted
*12:55.700- 12:59.000* :  since the start of the war, because the country's really seen
*12:59.000- 13:02.300* :  as reeling from those deadly seventh of October attacks.
*13:02.820- 13:07.360* :  But this is going to be something that is opposed by a great number
*13:07.600- 13:09.060* :  of ultra-orthodox men.
*13:09.060- 13:12.200* :  It's something that will really change their lifestyle
*13:12.200- 13:16.220* :  because many of them are dedicated to religious Torah study.
*13:16.820- 13:19.180* :  And it remains to be seen exactly what will happen.
*13:19.180- 13:21.680* :  But this will also have political shockwaves
*13:21.680- 13:26.620* :  because Israel's governing coalition relies on the support of ultra-orthodox Jewish parties.
*13:27.180- 13:29.060* :  This is such an important issue for them.
*13:29.560- 13:34.580* :  Really, they had been hoping that the government would come up with a new law
*13:34.580- 13:37.060* :  that would have allowed the exemption to continue.
*13:37.720- 13:38.960* :  Yuland, now, in Jerusalem.
*13:40.160- 13:43.600* :  Now, to soldiers in Ukraine, where many of those
*13:43.600- 13:48.140* :  serving on the front line are openly gay and challenging people's prejudices.
*13:48.840- 13:51.620* :  Ukraine is a country where many still hold socially conservative
*13:51.620- 13:53.780* :  and even homophobic views.
*13:54.300- 13:56.420* :  But the war has exposed an inequality.
*13:56.980- 13:59.200* :  Gay couples cannot get married in Ukraine.
*13:59.800- 14:01.620* :  And that means when these soldiers are killed,
*14:01.620- 14:05.360* :  their partners don't have the right to decide what happens to their bodies.
*14:06.140- 14:09.660* :  LGBT campaigners are now fighting for full equality
*14:09.660- 14:12.680* :  as our correspondent, G. McKenzie, reports from Keefe.
*14:14.520- 14:16.640* :  A sea of small blue and yellow flags
*14:16.640- 14:21.240* :  cover part of the main Midan Square in the center of Keefe.
*14:21.680- 14:23.900* :  They commemorate the fallen soldiers.
*14:24.920- 14:27.780* :  But today, a group of people from the LGBT community
*14:27.780- 14:29.960* :  have come to lay a different flag.
*14:30.200- 14:32.860* :  These ones have a unicorn in their center
*14:33.440- 14:35.940* :  and they are to represent each of the gay soldiers
*14:35.940- 14:37.440* :  that have been killed in this war.
*14:40.900- 14:42.960* :  One of those laying a flag just now is Rodion.
*14:43.380- 14:48.360* :  His former partner was killed in the very early months of the full-scale invasion.
*14:48.540- 14:51.740* :  Roma was, I think, like one of the best people, you know.
*14:52.320- 14:54.540* :  The deaths of gay soldiers on the front line
*14:54.540- 14:56.560* :  has exposed an injustice here.
*14:56.940- 14:59.420* :  LGBT people don't have equal rights.
*15:00.040- 15:02.840* :  They can't get married, which means if they're killed,
*15:02.840- 15:05.460* :  their partners aren't entitled to collect their bodies.
*15:05.860- 15:08.180* :  All these deaths, all these blood, the same.
*15:08.480- 15:11.680* :  No martyrs, heterosexual people or homosexual people.
*15:12.540- 15:19.040* :  How has Roman's death caused you to reflect on your rights here in Ukraine?
*15:19.600- 15:22.460* :  I don't want to feel like I'm like one of half citizens.
*15:23.480- 15:27.080* :  Like, I pay the same tax and the same pro-Ecranian.
*15:27.500- 15:31.660* :  Yes, and Rocket can kill me the same way, like everybody else.
*15:32.300- 15:34.580* :  And it's, uh, terrifying.
*15:34.580- 15:35.680* :  It is our reality.
*15:36.920- 15:38.440* :  The air rates are going off now.
*15:38.440- 15:38.700* :  Yes.
*15:40.640- 15:41.440* :  It's going to be a great rush soon.
*15:50.180- 15:53.200* :  People have turned out today in the pouring rain
*15:53.280- 15:56.480* :  for the first gay-pride march that has been held in Kiev
*15:56.500- 15:58.400* :  since the start of the full-scale invasion.
*15:58.880- 16:01.860* :  The past two were cancelled because of security reasons.
*16:02.440- 16:04.500* :  This one has been allowed to go ahead today,
*16:04.500- 16:07.500* :  but it looks very different to the march
*16:07.500- 16:10.360* :  that was held in 2021 before the war
*16:10.360- 16:12.860* :  when there was 10,000 people on the streets.
*16:13.480- 16:16.540* :  Only 500 people have been allowed to gather today.
*16:20.120- 16:23.820* :  Military campaigners are using this march to back a new bill
*16:24.080- 16:25.840* :  which would allow same-sex partnerships.
*16:28.020- 16:31.260* :  Around a dozen soldiers are here in their military uniforms.
*16:31.260- 16:34.880* :  And for some of them, this is their first ever pride march.
*16:35.500- 16:38.660* :  It is the first time that they have come out so publicly.
*16:39.340- 16:40.420* :  When did you come out?
*16:43.040- 16:43.120* :  Today.
*16:43.180- 16:45.160* :  Oh, congratulations, guys.
*16:46.040- 16:47.680* :  The couple don't want to give their names,
*16:48.020- 16:50.380* :  but one of them tells me he's a combat medic
*16:50.940- 16:53.160* :  and he was injured on the front line two weeks ago.
*16:53.720- 16:56.000* :  Why is this bill so important to you?
*16:56.040- 16:59.480* :  Why is it important that you are able to have a civil partnership?
*17:03.380- 17:04.480* :  I'm serving on the front line
*17:04.480- 17:06.100* :  and my life is always in danger.
*17:06.180- 17:09.920* :  I don't know what will happen to me one minute to the next.
*17:10.180- 17:12.340* :  If God forbid, I were to die.
*17:12.340- 17:16.420* :  My beloved partner could say he was my family and come for me.
*17:24.220- 17:28.360* :  Victor, you were the first openly gay soldier in the Ukrainian army
*17:28.820- 17:32.240* :  and you have since done so much to raise people's awareness
*17:32.240- 17:34.220* :  that the gay soldier is serving on the front line.
*17:34.800- 17:38.960* :  We achieved a change of people's attitude towards LGBT community.
*17:38.960- 17:43.160* :  We showed that there are LGBT defenders on the front line
*17:43.700- 17:45.160* :  and Ukrainians respect that.
*17:45.160- 17:48.040* :  They became more inclusive towards LGBT community.
*17:48.460- 17:50.440* :  How has society changed?
*17:50.640- 17:51.560* :  What have you seen?
*17:52.380- 17:55.640* :  I remember first marchers for equality.
*17:56.040- 17:57.720* :  They were attacked aggressively.
*17:58.320- 18:01.860* :  But every year people became more inclusive.
*18:02.680- 18:03.900* :  Gene McKenzie with that report.
*18:07.200- 18:10.780* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast with me Nick Miles, still to come.
*18:14.920- 18:20.860* :  A converted industrial building in Berlin home to a podcast studio called Undone.
*18:22.600- 18:23.140* :  We are Legion.
*18:24.780- 18:29.960* :  How German podcasters used artificial intelligence to find a suspected criminal
*18:30.400- 18:32.140* :  who'd been on the run for 30 years.
*18:39.980- 18:40.700* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*18:40.940- 18:44.900* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed
*18:44.900- 18:46.760* :  to raise prices due to inflation.
*18:47.200- 18:47.780* :  They said yes.
*18:47.820- 18:50.780* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*18:50.780- 18:54.560* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the fuck are you talking about?
*18:54.560- 18:55.900* :  You insane Hollywood ass.
*18:56.420- 18:59.980* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month
*18:59.980- 19:01.800* :  to just $15 a month.
*19:01.860- 19:04.320* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash Switch.
*19:04.540- 19:06.120* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees,

*19:10.540- 19:11.300* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*19:11.300- 19:15.260* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*19:15.620- 19:16.600* :  They charge you a lot.
*19:17.040- 19:17.900* :  We charge you a little.
*19:18.260- 19:21.820* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*19:21.860- 19:25.640* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*19:25.940- 19:26.300* :  That's right.
*19:26.300- 19:30.880* :  We're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*19:31.340- 19:33.700* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash Switch.
*19:34.220- 19:35.940* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees,

*19:37.320- 19:40.120* :  Unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month, so full turns at MintMobile.com.
*19:46.040- 19:50.680* :  China's Luna probe, the Chang'er 6, has returned back to Earth,
*19:50.980- 19:52.660* :  carrying very important cargo.
*19:53.200- 19:57.780* :  The first rock and soil samples ever gathered from the far side of the moon.
*19:58.120- 20:01.680* :  Here's the moment the capsule landed in the province of Inner Mongolia,
*20:01.680- 20:04.220* :  captured on Chinese state media's livestream.
*20:04.960- 20:07.760* :  We're expecting a landing any time soon.
*20:08.620- 20:11.600* :  So watching the descent of the returner,
*20:12.300- 20:14.920* :  it's landed.
*20:14.960- 20:19.760* :  You can hear applause from the ground controlling command center
*20:19.760- 20:22.440* :  as people watch this with breath and that is invaded.
*20:23.040- 20:26.380* :  So why are the scientists so thrilled with this latest development?
*20:27.000- 20:30.460* :  Professor Catherine Hamons, the astronomer Royal for Scotland,
*20:31.060- 20:32.660* :  spoke to the BBC's Michelle Hussain.
*20:33.220- 20:36.760* :  It was a very exciting last few hours watching
*20:36.760- 20:41.960* :  the Chang'er 6-Luna probe landing since the Inner Mongolia and the Grasslands.
*20:42.840- 20:45.960* :  Huge, huge congratulations to the Chinese space agency.
*20:45.960- 20:53.080* :  This is the successful completion of a 53-day mission to the moon to collect a sample
*20:53.600- 20:54.400* :  and bring it back.
*20:54.440- 20:56.320* :  And this is not just any sample.
*20:56.320- 20:58.780* :  There have been 10 samples returned from the moon,
*20:58.820- 21:03.140* :  but this is the first ever sample from the far side of the moon.
*21:03.140- 21:07.920* :  So it's incredibly exciting to see this landing successfully this morning.
*21:07.920- 21:10.160* :  It's wonderful to hear how closely you've been following it.
*21:10.220- 21:13.160* :  Now, I think you should probably explain the far side of the moon
*21:13.160- 21:16.100* :  because the moon orbits the earth,
*21:16.260- 21:18.620* :  but always with the same side facing us.
*21:18.820- 21:22.680* :  When we look up at the moon at night, we see what we call the near side of the moon.
*21:23.120- 21:27.140* :  And you can see these big grey regions,
*21:27.820- 21:30.100* :  some people call it the man in the moon.
*21:30.660- 21:33.980* :  Now, these grey regions are called Mare or Sea,
*21:34.560- 21:39.640* :  and we think that they were created in the past from volcanic activity, a sea of lava.
*21:40.580- 21:43.180* :  Now, when the first images came back from the far side of the moon,
*21:43.180- 21:46.480* :  which you can't see from earth, you have to send a spacecraft up there.
*21:47.040- 21:51.160* :  There was quite a big surprise because those Mare didn't exist on the far side of the moon.
*21:51.660- 21:55.160* :  Images of the far side, you can just see it sort of pockmarked with lots of different craters.
*21:55.160- 21:59.160* :  And that tells us that the geological activity on the moon
*21:59.160- 22:02.160* :  is very different on the near side and the far side.
*22:02.220- 22:05.860* :  And it's been a big puzzle why we see those differences.
*22:06.420- 22:10.180* :  And that tells us about how the moon was formed four and a half billion years ago.
*22:10.180- 22:16.080* :  We think from a big collision with a very, very early version of the earth
*22:16.480- 22:18.900* :  that created these two different bodies.
*22:19.180- 22:21.780* :  So there's lots of different theories about how it was created.
*22:21.780- 22:29.200* :  But in order to test those theories, we need samples to compare what the moon is like on the near side and the far side.
*22:30.300- 22:31.800* :  Professor Catherine Heyman's there.
*22:33.020- 22:38.580* :  From the moon to the ocean, and the United Nations says Australia should take urgent action
*22:38.740- 22:40.660* :  to save the Great Barrier Reef.
*22:41.100- 22:48.000* :  The UN's cultural organisation UNESCO is calling on Australia to be far more ambitious in its climate change targets.
*22:48.560- 22:51.720* :  If it wants to protect the world's largest living structure.
*22:52.460- 22:59.120* :  Corolla around the world is turning white and even dying as a recent record ocean heat takes a devastating toll.
*22:59.900- 23:02.680* :  Our Asia Pacific editor, Michael Bristo, is following the story.
*23:03.160- 23:08.620* :  Well, this is a scientific panel who prepared a series of recommendations for the World Heritage Committee,
*23:08.620- 23:13.060* :  which is meeting in India next month, which is why it's done now.
*23:13.620- 23:21.900* :  And it's essentially reflection of ongoing concern by UNESCO that the Great Barrier Reef is in severe danger,
*23:23.180- 23:24.520* :  particularly from bleaching events.
*23:24.520- 23:27.820* :  This is when ocean water heats up because of climate change.
*23:28.380- 23:32.160* :  And essentially, it just causes the coral to turn white.
*23:32.160- 23:37.160* :  There was a mass bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef again this year.
*23:37.940- 23:40.160* :  And that's the fifth time it's happened in the last eight years.
*23:40.160- 23:44.800* :  So this is why UNESCO is speaking out about it at the moment.
*23:45.100- 23:47.760* :  So UNESCO is saying Australia's got to be more ambitious.
*23:47.780- 23:51.700* :  What is Australia doing at the moment to help the Great Barrier Reef?
*23:51.820- 23:58.700* :  The Australian government has pushed back somewhat against this and essentially saying that this new Labour government came in
*23:58.700- 24:05.400* :  and has essentially trying to tackle climate change in a way that previous Australian governments didn't do.
*24:05.820- 24:07.060* :  So they've taken it more seriously.
*24:07.180- 24:13.400* :  And ultimately, this is what will protect the Gap Barrier Reef by keeping ocean temperatures to a particular level,
*24:13.580- 24:14.760* :  not getting too hot.
*24:15.260- 24:16.980* :  The current Labour government says it's doing that.
*24:17.300- 24:21.260* :  It says it's also doing a series of local actions to try and protect the Barrier Reef.
*24:21.260- 24:30.840* :  So, for example, making sure that any water that runs off into the sea from the land is free of pollutants and debris from the land.
*24:31.380- 24:35.220* :  And also ban certain types of fish in on the Great Barrier Reef.
*24:35.220- 24:41.680* :  So it says it's doing both local and bigger climate change actions in order to do this, which is why it's resisted slightly
*24:42.240- 24:46.220* :  a push within UNESCO to try and list the Great Barrier Reef as endangered.
*24:46.940- 24:47.480* :  Michael Brister.
*24:48.780- 24:53.840* :  Artificial intelligence is weaving its way into all aspects of modern day life.
*24:54.240- 24:57.480* :  Some argue for the better, but many fear the negatives.
*24:58.320- 25:07.040* :  It's the power of AI that podcasters in Germany have used it to track down a suspected terrorist who'd been on the run for 30 years.
*25:07.660- 25:14.240* :  Now, as Tim Mansell reports, the police want access to the same facial recognition software used by the journalists.
*25:18.360- 25:24.280* :  I converted industrial building in Berlin home to a podcast studio called Undone.
*25:25.980- 25:26.560* :  We are Legion.
*25:27.640- 25:32.700* :  In 2023, Undone released a series called Legion Most Wanted.
*25:32.900- 25:34.660* :  It's Legion. Most Wanted.
*25:35.380- 25:40.720* :  A listener had told them he'd met a woman who claimed to be a suspected terrorist, Daniela Kletter.
*25:41.180- 25:43.480* :  Kletter had been on the run for 30 years.
*25:44.120- 25:47.780* :  The Undone team decided to check their list of the story out.
*25:47.780- 25:56.220* :  So, with the help of an expert, they used an AI tool to compare a picture of the woman with a picture of Daniela Kletter.
*25:56.680- 25:59.400* :  And the first software said, no, it's not the same person.
*25:59.400- 26:00.860* :  It's no match. No, no match.
*26:01.320- 26:04.260* :  This is Patrick Stigerman, co-founder of Undone.
*26:04.900- 26:12.360* :  He and the team then got the AI expert to try something else, a tool that searches the internet for possible matches.
*26:13.000- 26:16.620* :  And bang, it was like this woman and she's in Berlin.
*26:17.220- 26:23.060* :  Patrick and a colleague went to look for her, but Daniela Kletter was nowhere to be found.
*26:23.940- 26:26.640* :  Imagine their astonishment when two months later.
*26:27.020- 26:33.100* :  Police in Germany have arrested a former member of the far left Red Army faction who had been on the run for 30 years.
*26:33.720- 26:36.500* :  65-year-old Daniela Kletter, who's suspected of...
*26:36.500- 26:42.260* :  The Red Army faction, also known as the Bardemainhof gang, was founded in 1970.
*26:42.260- 26:49.060* :  In the late 80s and early 90s, it claimed responsibility for a number of prominent assassinations.
*26:50.040- 26:53.800* :  The head of West Germany's biggest bank has been murdered in a car bomb attack.
*26:54.440- 26:57.840* :  A left-wing terrorist group, the Red Army faction, is thought to be responsible.
*26:58.600- 27:02.660* :  Alfred Herrhausen was head of the Deutsche Bank and an adviser to Chancellor Kletter.
*27:06.800- 27:11.060* :  The police chief, Friedo Defries, says the arrest of Daniela Kletter,
*27:11.360- 27:16.000* :  came after they were tipped off by a member of the public, not by the podcast.
*27:16.000- 27:21.460* :  In fact, the police aren't allowed to use the software used by the podcast makers.
*27:22.320- 27:24.960* :  But Friedo Defries says that needs to change.
*27:28.140- 27:35.800* :  What would help us on what we need in 2024 is to be able to compare photos that we've got with photos on the internet.
*27:36.520- 27:41.040* :  I think we need to have that discussion that we should be allowed to search for people online,
*27:41.040- 27:45.380* :  beyond our own police databases, using artificial intelligence.
*27:46.140- 27:51.560* :  The main opposition party in Germany, the CDU, agrees in a document submitted to Parliament.
*27:51.560- 27:55.880* :  It says the Kletter case highlights an urgent need to change the law.
*27:57.040- 28:02.460* :  It's the end of May and there's a big conference going on for the next three days here in Berlin.
*28:02.460- 28:06.520* :  It's called Republicer and as one person has told me,
*28:06.700- 28:11.420* :  it's a gathering of everybody who's important in the digital community in Germany.
*28:12.700- 28:13.140* :  Are you Theresa?
*28:13.460- 28:15.260* :  I'm Theresa. Hello. How are you?
*28:16.100- 28:18.720* :  Theresa Viglock is the chairman of Lod.
*28:18.940- 28:22.760* :  That's the Association for Liberal Internet Policy in Germany.
*28:23.280- 28:26.780* :  She's unimpressed by the argument that the law needs to change.
*28:27.480- 28:30.300* :  The dangers are to everyone's civil liberties.
*28:31.360- 28:35.920* :  And what we as Lod always say is, not everything that could be done should be done by the police.
*28:36.400- 28:40.920* :  If the police had had access to the software we're talking about,
*28:40.920- 28:46.520* :  perhaps they would have found Daniela Kletter significantly sooner than they did.
*28:47.100- 28:51.700* :  Yeah, maybe, but police shouldn't be striving for being fast than criminals,
*28:52.380- 28:53.920* :  but for being more decent than criminals.
*28:54.660- 28:57.760* :  And you're going to hear more on this story in this week's assignment,
*28:57.760- 29:02.860* :  Germany's AI detectives on the BBC World Service and on BBC Sounds.
*29:04.180- 29:07.800* :  And let's finish with a classic sporting underdog story.
*29:08.620- 29:12.800* :  While much of the world's attention is on football's European Championship in Germany,
*29:13.300- 29:20.040* :  Afghanistan has just clinched an unlikely semi-final birth in Cricket 2020 World Cup in the Caribbean.
*29:20.820- 29:25.100* :  A win against Bangladesh secured the country's first ever semi-final appearance
*29:25.540- 29:28.700* :  and also not with the highly fanciful Australian side out.
*29:29.360- 29:31.280* :  Sparky celebrations across the country.
*29:40.080- 29:42.960* :  Afghanistan's captain, Rashid Khan,
*29:42.960- 29:48.540* :  spoke to reporters after the dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh in St Vincent.
*29:49.420- 29:52.340* :  Well, I don't know how to describe my feeling.
*29:52.340- 29:55.260* :  It's a bigger achievement for us being in the semi-finals.
*29:55.300- 30:00.080* :  And yeah, I think the cricket we have played in the whole tournament so far,
*30:00.420- 30:05.040* :  we deserve to be in the semi-s in the way everyone took the responsibility
*30:05.180- 30:08.880* :  of getting into the game and performing best for the team.
*30:09.440- 30:14.200* :  So I don't know how can describe my feeling, but it's massive achievement for us as a team
*30:14.200- 30:17.980* :  and as a nation to be in the semi-s in now looking forward to the semi-s.
*30:18.560- 30:21.760* :  Afghanistan will now play South Africa in the semi-finals,
*30:22.280- 30:24.920* :  while in the other match England will meet India.
*30:28.020- 30:32.520* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the Global News Podcast later on.
