*01:43.120- 01:46.520* :  This is the HappyPod from the BBC World Service.
*01:51.300- 01:55.740* :  I'm Jackie Lennard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday, January 20th,
*01:55.880- 02:01.180* :  the quick-thinking teenage swimmers who saved holidaymakers from a rip tide in the Caribbean.
*02:01.460- 02:05.900* :  We didn't even stop to think about anything and we just wanted to help them
*02:06.400- 02:09.060* :  and we did it all properly in the right way.
*02:09.280- 02:14.360* :  The surgeon who carried out a world-first partial heart transplant on a newborn baby.
*02:14.560- 02:18.560* :  Talk about the joy of your life to be able to see a child that you've done a groundbreaking
*02:18.560- 02:24.760* :  operation on and to see how happy the family was. And what Finland is doing to sort out homelessness.
*02:24.760- 02:29.820* :  It sounds so simple. You'll give people a home of their own and things start to happen.
*02:30.260- 02:34.820* :  Also in this podcast, it's a beautiful example of what you can achieve when working together.
*02:35.280- 02:38.440* :  We designed a specialised Hedgehog Crest's dummy.
*02:38.440- 02:43.920* :  A hedgehog shaped crash test dummy to protect wildlife from a new man-made peril
*02:44.480- 02:48.680* :  and the hats trying to get you excited about the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.
*02:55.320- 03:00.220* :  Picture this. A holiday in Barbados. A relaxing swim in the Caribbean.
*03:01.000- 03:06.420* :  Then disaster. A rip tide. And despite how you struggle, you can't get to shore.
*03:07.000- 03:13.680* :  Thank goodness then for Zoe Ireland Beclensek aged 13 and Emma Basserman aged 14
*03:13.680- 03:19.000* :  who knew exactly what to do. Belinda Stone and her husband Robert were the lucky rescues
*03:19.600- 03:22.220* :  and this is what a very grateful Belinda toll CBC.
*03:26.420- 03:29.520* :  So let's hear from the Canadian heroes themselves.
*03:29.520- 03:36.040* :  Starting with Zoe. I was boogie boarding with Emma and I heard a faint call for help in the
*03:36.040- 03:41.280* :  distance. I was looking around to see who was and I could see a girl pretty far out
*03:41.280- 03:46.280* :  and she was waving her arms around. So I go out and she told me that her husband was further out
*03:46.700- 03:50.180* :  and he was struggling to swim back and she needed a lifeguard. I said that there aren't
*03:50.180- 03:54.160* :  any lifeguards on the beach so I act as quick as I could and I put her onto the boogie board
*03:54.580- 03:57.300* :  and I pulled her into shore by going to parallel.
*03:57.880- 04:02.300* :  So I was wondering what was happening and I went back in to see them and by that time Zoe
*04:02.300- 04:06.900* :  had brought back the woman and the woman was talking about how her husband was further out
*04:07.080- 04:13.280* :  and he needed help. So me and Zoe, we both went back out and she put the man on her boogie board
*04:13.280- 04:18.320* :  and tied the strap to her ankle and she started swimming with him and I think that's a very
*04:18.320- 04:21.780* :  impressive thing because I don't think a lot of people would have been able to do that.
*04:22.400- 04:27.540* :  So I told her where to go. I told her to keep going parallel to the beach and to go diagonal when
*04:27.540- 04:33.460* :  we were going back in just in case and I kept looking back at the husband that was on the boogie
*04:33.460- 04:37.760* :  board because he was breathing very hard and I was quite worried about him and then I was also
*04:38.180- 04:41.920* :  keeping an eye out for the wife that was on the beach to make sure that she wasn't going back
*04:41.920- 04:45.600* :  into the ocean because that could have been very disastrous as well.
*04:45.980- 04:52.380* :  They were really lucky that you were there not as swimmers but really good swimmers.
*04:52.440- 04:55.220* :  I mean we're talking we're talking a limbic hopeful right?
*04:55.860- 05:01.620* :  So I've been training incredibly for six years and I'm going to Olympic trials in May.
*05:02.320- 05:06.020* :  I hope to make the Olympics either in 2028 or 2032.
*05:06.560- 05:12.860* :  And Zoe tell us a little bit more about the sort of reaction that you have had to your heroics
*05:12.860- 05:19.720* :  in rescuing this couple. I'm pretty shocked about it. I'm not entirely sure why everybody's
*05:19.960- 05:23.940* :  kind of like whoa you did that because I feel like it's a human thing.
*05:23.940- 05:29.760* :  Anybody who sees anybody in danger you're going to help them but I'm so happy that the
*05:29.760- 05:32.040* :  word's getting out about how something is so important.
*05:33.160- 05:38.340* :  Now I'm just going to bring in your coach Chuck who is listening to this conversation.
*05:39.240- 05:41.640* :  When you heard about this what was your reaction?
*05:42.320- 05:47.220* :  So I'm Zoe's dad as well and Emma's coach. When Zoe came and told me I was like
*05:47.220- 05:51.680* :  sure sounds good Zoe. I didn't really believe that you were not saved someone.
*05:52.420- 05:57.960* :  She's a bit of a prankster sometimes but Michelle her mom was there and saying no the couple
*05:57.960- 06:03.700* :  came up to us and was thanking us perfume. I'm like are you serious? She says yes they went
*06:03.700- 06:09.980* :  in there and saved this couple who were obviously very thankful and I was incredulous at first and
*06:09.980- 06:15.900* :  now I'm just not only proud but impressed that they were able to do this for Zoe to pull
*06:16.660- 06:22.740* :  a grown man and she's a tiny little thing so to be able to do this was a great feat of
*06:22.740- 06:28.820* :  not just strengthen endurance but they were smart playing them in the right way is something
*06:28.820- 06:32.580* :  you don't always think of in a moment of crisis and they did which was great.
*06:33.960- 06:41.700* :  You taught them that well done. Back to you ladies. What advice would you give to someone
*06:41.700- 06:48.020* :  that they should know before they go swimming in the sea how to escape a rip tide if there aren't
*06:48.020- 06:52.580* :  any Canadian superheroes around? When you're caught in a rip tide always make sure you're swimming
*06:52.580- 06:59.020* :  parallel and if you notice that you're not going anywhere by swimming parallel try to call for help
*06:59.420- 07:03.920* :  but if nobody notices then just go the opposite direction swim parallel the other way.
*07:04.740- 07:10.660* :  Do you have any message for your newfound worldwide fans? Definitely.
*07:11.660- 07:17.340* :  Know how to swim that's a big one. I'm so grateful that my dad has coached for like I'm
*07:17.340- 07:21.540* :  going to say more than 30 years but I'm not so sure but I'm so grateful for my dad that he
*07:22.040- 07:26.460* :  taught me from a very young age how to swim and if it wasn't for him teaching me
*07:26.720- 07:30.580* :  I wouldn't be able to go and help that couple but thankfully I was able to.
*07:30.980- 07:37.360* :  Anima? As a message in general I would definitely just say to keep working on what you love
*07:37.360- 07:43.680* :  and to always push for your best in anything you do. Emma Basserman look out for her in the
*07:43.680- 07:51.240* :  2028 Olympics and fellow hero Zoe, Ireland, Maclensek and a reminder that they are just 14 and
*07:51.240- 07:58.740* :  13. We also heard from Zoe's dad coach Chuck and a shout out to Dorval swim club in Montreal.
*08:00.160- 08:05.840* :  A first birthday party is a joyous thing. How much more so when the smiling birthday boy
*08:05.840- 08:12.120* :  is the recipient of the world's first partial heart transplant carried out when he was just 17
*08:12.120- 08:19.800* :  days old and desperately unwell. Dr. Joseph Turek, pediatric heart surgeon at Duke University
*08:19.800- 08:26.200* :  in North Carolina told us about the breakthrough. This is the first time in the world that we've
*08:26.200- 08:32.280* :  been able to take valves and have them grow in a human. This was a newborn who was in desperate
*08:32.280- 08:38.380* :  need of new valves to replace the aortic and the pulmonary valve, the two valves that come
*08:38.380- 08:44.940* :  outside of the heart and we were able to use valves obtained from a donor and here we are 21 months
*08:44.940- 08:50.860* :  later and both of these valves are growing in proportion to the baby's size and they're completely
*08:50.860- 08:57.060* :  competent. They don't leak whatsoever. How is your little patient now? He is doing just amazing
*08:57.060- 09:03.200* :  things. He's meeting all of his milestones. I've had a very close relationship with this family
*09:03.200- 09:08.680* :  and so I followed him along the way. They've zoomed me in for his first birthday party when he
*09:08.680- 09:13.800* :  smashed his first birthday cake. I mean talk about the joy of your life to be able to see a child
*09:13.800- 09:20.680* :  that you've done a groundbreaking operation on and to see how happy the family was. You would look
*09:20.680- 09:27.740* :  at him and you have no idea that these, this heart pioneer. That's just wonderful news. So what does
*09:27.740- 09:34.700* :  this development mean for other infants who might need this sort of treatment? This opens up an
*09:34.700- 09:41.700* :  entirely new field for babies in need of valves. This could potentially be the solution for thousands
*09:41.700- 09:47.140* :  and thousands of children moving forward in need of valves and so far there have been 13 of these
*09:47.140- 09:52.380* :  cases now done. So 12 since baby Owen had his initial partial heart transplant. There have been 12 more.
*09:52.680- 09:57.480* :  We've done nine of them but I think one of the things we are most proud of is that we have taught
*09:57.480- 10:04.580* :  three other colleagues how to do this as well. Why is it better than a full heart transplant?
*10:05.540- 10:11.640* :  The problem with full heart transplant in newborn babies is it takes at least in the US. It takes
*10:11.640- 10:17.480* :  about four to six months for a heart to become available and Owen didn't have that kind of time.
*10:18.560- 10:23.880* :  Why did you become a pediatric heart surgeon? Early on I was really impressed with the
*10:23.880- 10:28.940* :  challenge involved in pediatric heart surgery. You have to realize we're operating on
*10:28.940- 10:34.860* :  hearts that are the size of a strawberry and performing very complex type of repairs and that
*10:34.860- 10:39.620* :  challenge really attracted me. And then I think the other thing that I really enjoy about this is
*10:39.820- 10:44.900* :  I enjoy the responsibility being there for these families. You know, this is their baby,
*10:44.900- 10:49.200* :  this is their everything. And I want to have that responsibility and I want to be able to help
*10:49.200- 10:55.040* :  that family out. And this case really highlights that. We didn't have good options for Owen.
*10:55.040- 11:00.960* :  I approached the family about this idea of partial heart transplantation. They asked me to have
*11:00.960- 11:07.540* :  you done this before. And my response was we've done it in five piglets. But then they put their
*11:07.540- 11:12.840* :  trust in us and said, well, I guess Owen's going to be your first human. You really have to admire
*11:12.840- 11:18.640* :  the courage of the family as well, don't you? Because obviously you have this tiny life in your
*11:18.640- 11:25.360* :  hands and they have entrusted their child to you. It takes incredible courage for a family like
*11:25.360- 11:30.760* :  this. And I don't think we could have asked for a better family for this groundbreaking procedure.
*11:30.760- 11:37.100* :  You have to have a family that also is going to be trusting and to be willing to take that risk.
*11:37.220- 11:42.000* :  And the other piece that played into them and Roe family choosing to move forward with
*11:42.000- 11:47.920* :  partial heart transplantation was the idea that they could potentially help thousands and
*11:47.920- 11:54.900* :  thousands of children down the road with this very courageous move. What's your hope for this
*11:54.900- 12:00.120* :  particular advance that has been made with Little Owen? What do you hope to see happen with it
*12:00.120- 12:05.720* :  and what sort of timescale? I hope that this becomes the standard of care for babies that need
*12:05.720- 12:12.120* :  valve replacements. And I think it will be. The data is incredibly promising right now. We need to
*12:12.120- 12:17.820* :  figure out a way in which we can make this so that it's available to more and more pediatric heart
*12:17.820- 12:22.940* :  centers so that they can perform these lifesaving procedures on these children. And I think that
*12:23.260- 12:27.580* :  two or three years down the line, this is going to be commonplace within our profession.
*12:28.180- 12:34.800* :  Dr. Joseph Tiaric, what would you do with $27 million? Marlena Engelhorn from Austria has just
*12:34.800- 12:39.400* :  inherited that amount from her grandmother and she's planning to give away a hefty chunk of it.
*12:39.980- 12:46.840* :  And she's setting up a group of fellow citizens to decide how. A random sample of 10,000 people
*12:46.840- 12:53.760* :  have been asked to apply and of them 50 will be chosen. James Menenda spoke to Marlena about her
*12:53.760- 12:59.660* :  decision and what limitations they'll be on spending the fortune. They can't do something that goes
*12:59.660- 13:04.740* :  against the constitution. They can't do anything that's against democracy or violent or against
*13:04.740- 13:10.340* :  life. They can't destroy anything or buy weapons or stuff like that. It can also not be profit-oriented.
*13:10.940- 13:14.500* :  But other than that, they're really free to decide and I am absolutely not free to do anything
*13:14.500- 13:19.540* :  about it. What do you hope they come up with? What do they decide to give all the money for example
*13:19.540- 13:25.040* :  to a donkey sanctuary? If they can argue that well to the public eyes and ears who are going to
*13:25.040- 13:30.100* :  look really closely, that's perfectly okay. I don't think that this is what's going to come out of
*13:30.100- 13:35.060* :  it. I think the deliberation and the process will really create awesome ideas and we're going to
*13:35.060- 13:40.960* :  learn so much from these people. Would you rather the government had taken this money in tax and then
*13:40.960- 13:47.120* :  it was up to them to distribute it? I wish that the government would do that and I still think it's
*13:47.120- 13:52.840* :  the best way to do it because it's the most democratically legitimized way of handling redistribution.
*13:53.680- 13:58.260* :  I still want to be taxed on my wealth. I still wish that there was going to be a reform but it
*13:58.260- 14:03.080* :  doesn't mean that I get to be inactive about it and just have these nice wishes. I want something
*14:03.080- 14:08.300* :  done and I want my redistribution to reflect all the democratic principles that I think are so
*14:08.300- 14:13.740* :  valuable in our society. So this good council is really a good outcome. Maybe it's more democratic.
*14:13.800- 14:18.800* :  It's a more direct way of citizens being able to say how their money is spent. I mean lots of
*14:18.800- 14:23.820* :  people would argue that the way that governments spend money can be wasteful. It doesn't always
*14:23.820- 14:28.180* :  target the sorts of things that people care about. It's true and you can argue the same about rich
*14:28.180- 14:32.300* :  people. The way that they spend their money and ruin the climate with it for instance is also
*14:32.300- 14:37.960* :  pretty awful and we still have to take it because that's how our world works but we can regulate
*14:37.960- 14:43.420* :  our and we can regulate wealth that might be something that comes out of it. But you're not giving
*14:43.420- 14:51.280* :  away all your money. I will eventually have redistributed everything other than what I have
*14:51.280- 14:56.680* :  needed the past two and a half years but I want to transfer into having a job, having a salary
*14:56.680- 15:01.580* :  being able to cover my cost with my income. That's where I want to end up. The thing is the
*15:01.580- 15:07.600* :  condition under which extreme wealth are possible are extreme poverty and if a democratic decision
*15:07.600- 15:15.240* :  can end poverty by ending extreme inequality then I'm very happy to join this route. I'd rather
*15:15.240- 15:20.520* :  live in a world where we have a much more equal society and where we share our resources we can
*15:20.520- 15:25.840* :  regulate how birth affects us and we can make sure that we can be much more equal individuals in
*15:25.840- 15:29.020* :  a democratic society by sharing. Marlena Engelhorn

*17:45.420- 17:51.980* :  What happens if you give a homeless person somewhere to live with no strings attached? Finland has
*17:51.980- 17:56.960* :  adopted a radical approach called housing first in which homeless people are simply offered their
*17:56.960- 18:02.820* :  own apartment alongside whatever support it is they need to remain housed. The idea is the
*18:02.820- 18:07.540* :  that it's easier to sort out issues such as addiction or poor mental health if you have a secure
*18:07.540- 18:12.720* :  home. It's been going for a few years now and Erica Benker has been to see how it's working.
*18:13.740- 18:21.800* :  What did you think when you first saw this? Wow. What was the wow about the size or the size?
*18:22.760- 18:26.580* :  This is actually the nicest apartment where I have ever lived.
*18:33.880- 18:37.820* :  Home, cozy, private. I just love it.
*18:40.060- 18:44.580* :  It's called housing first and it's as straightforward as it sounds.
*18:46.760- 18:51.720* :  I think it's the beauty of the housing first that you know it sounds so simple. You give people
*18:51.720- 18:59.060* :  a home of their own and things start to happen. So in 2007 with funding from the government
*18:59.780- 19:06.060* :  the Y Foundation started buying up apartments. They were then rented out to homeless people
*19:06.460- 19:12.040* :  at a rate that they could afford usually covered by their benefits. At the same time
*19:12.700- 19:18.000* :  shelters were converted into self-contained apartments with lots of communal space
*19:18.000- 19:26.180* :  and, crucially, on-site support. So we're heading to the Rainola Housing Unit. Welcome.
*19:26.840- 19:31.660* :  My name is Jarkvi Rosalana. I'm a manager of the Rainola Housing Unit. This is the
*19:32.160- 19:39.140* :  community's living room and this is free space to come and watch TV or play games or chat.
*19:47.560- 19:54.400* :  There are huge windows with a gorgeous view onto a forest and lake. It all feels very peaceful
*19:54.400- 20:04.440* :  and cozy. In the hallway we meet a tenant moping the floor. It's one of the optional work activities
*20:04.440- 20:10.840* :  on offer here. Tannins can earn a bit of extra money and perhaps learn a new skill that
*20:10.940- 20:18.400* :  eventually might help them get a job outside the unit. In his 20s Petri found himself sleeping
*20:18.400- 20:27.720* :  off in Helsinki. I was six years in the streets. Winter was very bad. You have to walk
*20:27.720- 20:33.600* :  when you're outside at the night that you can keep your body warm. If I don't get this chance
*20:33.600- 20:40.900* :  I'd be six feet under. Hundred percent saved my life. Were you in touch with your family?
*20:41.520- 20:47.480* :  It was very rough time because I don't have even a phone. Now things are much better because I can
*20:47.480- 20:54.140* :  call my mom. You have your family back? Yeah and they got me back and I feel very lucky.
*20:54.920- 21:00.120* :  Petri is one of around 6,000 people in Finland who moved into housing first
*21:00.140- 21:06.100* :  apartments and of those people about 90 percent have remained housed.
*21:07.800- 21:15.040* :  But for you her success is a very individual matter. The main thing is that you know when
*21:15.040- 21:19.740* :  politicians see that there are no ones sleeping on the streets in the city center of Helsinki
*21:20.140- 21:24.500* :  we're going to keep Helsinki clean and safe and vibrant city for everyone.
*21:25.120- 21:32.540* :  When it was first set up in 2007 how much did it cost initially? It cost around 170 million euros.
*21:33.180- 21:38.120* :  It was a big investment because we knew it's the right thing to do and at the same time we are
*21:38.120- 21:43.480* :  also able to save money in the future and that is because they don't need to use the expensive
*21:43.480- 21:49.120* :  emergency services and of course some of the people when they get the home and support they might
*21:49.120- 21:52.920* :  come back to working life began paying taxes and so on.
*21:56.300- 22:01.200* :  Before I leave Vindola another resident Kimo invites me into his apartment.
*22:02.220- 22:09.180* :  Before he became homeless Kimo ran his own business for 18 years and now he's setting up a new one.
*22:09.940- 22:15.960* :  How did you become homeless? I got to have brain owners and then I had a severe case of depression.
*22:16.220- 22:24.360* :  I just couldn't take care of myself so. At first Kimo was given a single room in a more
*22:24.360- 22:31.960* :  traditional homeless hostel. He couldn't visit other occupants rooms. It felt like a
*22:31.960- 22:39.880* :  prison actually. What has changed since you moved here in September? Freedom. It's wonderful.
*22:41.840- 22:47.360* :  Visiting Vindola there's a real sense of people thriving and getting home with their lives
*22:47.740- 22:51.120* :  now that they don't have to worry about finding a bed for the night.
*22:52.220- 22:59.980* :  Before I go I ask Petri what it's like to feel his own set of keys in his pocket after all those
*22:59.980- 23:08.260* :  years on the street. When I walk somewhere outside I just do like this. You got them in your
*23:08.260- 23:17.620* :  fist very tiny. Yeah. Looks like my treasure. Erica banker in Finland and you can hear more on
*23:17.620- 23:22.440* :  housing first if you just look for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*23:23.460- 23:29.700* :  Now what to do about a new peril for wildlife robotic lawn mowers? Stay with me.
*23:30.440- 23:36.680* :  Sales of robo-mowers are growing but do they know to stop for the creatures that scuttle,
*23:36.680- 23:42.340* :  scurry or squeak in your garden. Here in the UK we are especially worried about the decline in
*23:42.340- 23:48.320* :  hedgehog populations and a hedgehog shaped crash test dummy has been designed to help ensure
*23:48.320- 23:54.280* :  mower designers take wildlife into account. It's based on research at the University of Oxford
*23:54.280- 24:01.260* :  led by Dr Sophie Lund-Rasmussen. Some of these models not all may be harmful to the hedgehogs
*24:01.940- 24:07.380* :  and being a researcher at the Y Crew University of Oxford specialising in wildlife conservation
*24:07.440- 24:12.680* :  and naturally feel a responsibility for eliminating this potential threat to the remaining
*24:12.680- 24:17.680* :  hedgehogs. And are they actually the ones you saw that harm hedgehogs? Are they actually running
*24:17.680- 24:23.480* :  over them or are they injuring them in a way that's potentially fatal? Yeah the problem is that
*24:23.480- 24:28.140* :  they don't detect the hedgehogs so they keep running over them and you've come up with something
*24:28.140- 24:34.060* :  which enables people to check their lawn mower? Yes so this project is a beautiful example of what
*24:34.060- 24:38.980* :  you can achieve when working together. So the research was originally funded by the British
*24:38.980- 24:44.040* :  hedgehog preservation society and now two of the major manufacturers of robotic lawn mowers
*24:44.040- 24:49.920* :  steal in Husqvarna have taken over and we work in close collaboration to design hedgehog friendly
*24:49.920- 24:56.500* :  robotic lawn mowers with my results from my research informing the design of these new robotic lawn mowers.
*24:57.100- 25:03.840* :  We designed a specialised hedgehog crest system which can be 3D printed and used in these safety
*25:03.840- 25:08.780* :  tests we've designed allowing the manufacturers to actually test their products in the development
*25:08.780- 25:15.120* :  process of making more hedgehog friendly robotic lawn mowers. Is it possible I'm sure you hope to
*25:15.120- 25:21.080* :  get the point where all new ones are hedgehog friendly? How would people know today if they are
*25:22.100- 25:27.580* :  so the next step is to have this security or safety test implemented in the testing protocol
*25:27.580- 25:33.600* :  that actually approves the machine for sale at the European market and this will hopefully lead
*25:33.600- 25:37.880* :  to a labeling system that would guide the consumers into buying the hedgehog friendly robotic
*25:37.880- 25:43.160* :  lawn mowers that will allow us to eliminate at least that potential risk to the hedgehog survival
*25:43.160- 25:50.500* :  and eventually save the hedgehogs. Dr Sophie Lund Rasmussen known on social media as Dr
*25:50.500- 25:55.380* :  hedgehog and she was talking to Michelle Hussein and if you're in a part of the world where you
*25:55.380- 25:59.740* :  don't have hedgehogs I will share a video of the one in my garden just for the explanatory
*25:59.740- 26:05.660* :  purposes obviously. Now with six months to go until the Paris Olympics it's not just the athletes
*26:05.660- 26:11.900* :  who are racing against the clock. A team of soft toy makers in Paris are sowing and stuffing
*26:11.900- 26:17.500* :  hundreds of thousands of red, white and blue mascots. The mascots represent the small,
*26:17.500- 26:23.420* :  fridgian caps worn for centuries as a strong symbol of liberty and inclusivity.
*26:24.020- 26:27.840* :  Nisha Patel has been to Paris to see the video characters come to life.
*26:29.500- 26:34.940* :  This is the official video launching the phoenix. It starts with an odd to the past.
*26:34.940- 26:41.260* :  The famous Delevoir painting depicting Marianne dressed in Roman clothing wearing this
*26:41.260- 26:48.540* :  recognisable red, freezing cap. Pike in one hand the French flag flaring in its full glory
*26:48.540- 26:57.460* :  in the other. Then the cap jumps up with legs and eyes donning the Paris 2024 logo on its front
*26:58.360- 27:03.620* :  and from behind appears its partner Paralympic mascot with a running prosthetic.
*27:04.660- 27:08.600* :  The pair run and play some of the Olympic and Paralympic sports.
*27:09.460- 27:10.140* :  Skateboarding.
*27:12.440- 27:15.820* :  Wheelchair basketball. Archery.
*27:18.100- 27:23.420* :  Like many Olympic games these mascots will be available to buy. At first the contractor
*27:23.420- 27:29.600* :  manufacture these was given to a company in China but this sparked huge public outrage in France.
*27:30.540- 27:36.760* :  A new contract was won by French firm Dudu et Compagnie which has a long history in designing
*27:36.760- 27:43.080* :  and manufacturing quality soft toys. They are now producing the mascots which require 38
*27:43.080- 27:50.140* :  processes to make and have a unique feature Paris 2024 written in Braille on the underside.
*27:50.960- 27:52.880* :  Debra Vittel is the general manager.
*27:53.140- 27:59.820* :  The freedom cap represents freedom liberty in French history. It's part of our daily life
*27:59.820- 28:06.320* :  because for example each represents French Republic but you can also sit on the stems in the coins.
*28:06.380- 28:11.900* :  It has a strong relation also with arts. If you go to Louvre Museum you will see quite a lot of
*28:11.900- 28:18.980* :  paintings on which a woman men but also woman wears this freedom cap as a symbol of liberty.
*28:19.360- 28:25.000* :  In front of me here I've got some of the mascots every made in China and also I've got one here
*28:25.000- 28:31.180* :  that's made in Paris which is slightly larger. It costs and this is roughly nine times more
*28:31.180- 28:36.640* :  expensive than in China. These are selling about 43-44 dollars. I mean that's quite expensive
*28:36.640- 28:43.140* :  from mascot. We have decided to use a specific plush, French traditional plush. It was very
*28:43.140- 28:50.240* :  important for us. We also decided to make an innovation so that the children can play with it,
*28:50.460- 28:55.500* :  do some sports with the mascots. The price is a little bit higher because this is also the
*28:55.500- 29:03.620* :  price of the French manufacturing. So 39 euros is a price yes but it's a price of an industrial
*29:03.620- 29:12.260* :  project and a price for a plush souvenir. With a target of half a million to make by July
*29:12.260- 29:18.280* :  the race is on for this company to be ready for the world's biggest festival of sport.
*29:22.200- 29:29.400* :  That was Nietzsche Patel in Paris and that's it from us for now but remember if you'd like to
