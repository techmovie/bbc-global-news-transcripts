*01:36.880- 01:40.120* :  Hello, this is the Global News podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:40.440- 01:45.300* :  I'm Robin Brant, and in the early hours of Wednesday,
*01:45.300- 01:47.760* :  the 17th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:47.760- 01:54.580* :  The US National Security Advisor says Washington is seeking to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East,
*01:55.240- 01:57.840* :  despite its recent actions against Houthi militants.
*01:58.320- 02:01.420* :  But Jake Sullivan says the course of the conflict depends on Iran.
*02:02.240- 02:06.960* :  Pakistan has angrily condemned Iran for carrying out what it said was a deadly
*02:06.960- 02:11.960* :  missile strike in Balochistan. Iran said it had attacked separatist militants.
*02:12.560- 02:16.400* :  And two deputy chairman of Britain's ruling conservative party have resigned
*02:16.400- 02:21.040* :  for defying the government and voting for changes to its controversial immigration bill.
*02:23.780- 02:32.480* :  Also in this podcast, researchers created 11 of which were implanted in surrogate animals,
*02:33.160- 02:35.080* :  one of which led to a healthy offspring.
*02:35.480- 02:39.900* :  Scientists in China say a cloned monkey has lived healthily for two years,
*02:40.380- 02:43.340* :  defying the short-lived fate of other cloned primates.
*02:47.320- 02:51.380* :  But we start in the Middle East, where the US is seeking a de-escalation
*02:51.380- 02:56.400* :  in rising tensions in the region, that's according to President Biden's National Security Advisor,
*02:57.160- 03:00.360* :  despite the country's strikes on Houthi rebels based in Yemen.
*03:00.880- 03:05.220* :  Jake Sullivan made the comments at the annual economic gathering in Davos in Switzerland.
*03:05.720- 03:08.980* :  We are not looking for regional conflict, far from it.
*03:09.840- 03:13.200* :  Through a combination of steady deterrence and steadfast diplomacy,
*03:13.260- 03:18.580* :  we seek to stop the spread of conflict and to create the conditions for de-escalation.
*03:18.920- 03:25.180* :  Our approach is and remains focused on moving towards greater integration and stability
*03:27.080- 03:31.800* :  or the missile strikes by the US military are in response to Houthi attacks on international
*03:31.800- 03:37.460* :  commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The latest attack by the Houthi rebels caused
*03:37.460- 03:42.660* :  what was described as material but minor damage to a greek-owned vessel when it was hit
*03:42.660- 03:47.360* :  near the Yemeni port of Salif. Also speaking in Davos, the Prime Minister of Qatar,
*03:47.360- 03:52.840* :  Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman al-Fani said the US-led military strikes in Yemen
*03:52.840- 03:59.680* :  won't contain the attacks. This is also will create a higher risk of further escalation
*03:59.680- 04:06.160* :  and further expansion of that. We always prefer diplomacy over any military resolutions and we
*04:06.160- 04:13.160* :  believe that we shouldn't just focus on on those small conflicts. We should focus on the
*04:13.160- 04:19.280* :  main conflict in Gaza and as soon as it's defused, I believe everything else will be defused.
*04:19.780- 04:24.740* :  So that's the view of the Qatari government before that the US government. I got more from
*04:24.740- 04:29.920* :  our correspondent Hugo Bachega who's following events from Beirut. The Houthi is saying that these
*04:29.920- 04:35.920* :  attacks are going to continue. They say that this wave of attacks targeting these commercial
*04:35.920- 04:42.900* :  ships in the Red Sea are in protest at what's happening in Gaza, the Israeli war against Hamas,
*04:43.240- 04:49.200* :  and they say that these attacks will continue unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza. And I think
*04:49.200- 04:55.400* :  earlier we saw that another ship was hit by a missile near Yemen thought to have been fired by
*04:55.400- 05:01.640* :  the Houthis. There was no significant damage. There were no injuries, but it shows that the Houthis
*05:01.640- 05:07.500* :  continued to have the ability to carry out these attacks despite these airstrikes that have
*05:07.500- 05:12.440* :  been carried out by the Americans, by the British, targeting Houthi positions in Yemen.
*05:12.660- 05:18.220* :  Isn't that one view that it would appear that the American and initially British military
*05:18.220- 05:22.120* :  attempted to degrade the Houthis capabilities? Don't seem to be working.
*05:22.720- 05:27.740* :  Well, I think there was the question from the start. What is the plan? And the Americans in
*05:27.740- 05:34.360* :  the British have said that the goal here is to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.
*05:34.360- 05:39.740* :  We've seen that those attacks by the Houthis have caused a major economic disruption,
*05:39.900- 05:47.100* :  major disruption to international trade. There was rising oil prices and all the rest.
*05:47.500- 05:54.480* :  So they said that this was to prevent a major economic impact from those attacks.
*05:54.480- 06:00.700* :  But we saw that after the first wave of the attacks, American officials said that only
*06:00.700- 06:06.900* :  between 20 to 30 percent of the infrastructure being used by the Houthis in those attacks had
*06:06.900- 06:12.240* :  been damaged or destroyed. In other words, it means that the Houthis still have the weapons,
*06:12.460- 06:18.540* :  the positions, everything they need to carry out those attacks. These attacks have continued
*06:18.540- 06:23.500* :  and I think there were questions over whether there would be another wave of attacks,
*06:23.500- 06:27.240* :  especially from the Americans. And I think this is exactly what has happened.
*06:27.800- 06:33.580* :  Hugo Bachega reporting from Beirut. Well, let's stay in the city because Lebanon's economy has been
*06:33.580- 06:39.520* :  hard by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The country is heavily reliant on tourism
*06:39.520- 06:44.640* :  and hospitality, but few people are visiting at the moment and thousands of Lebanese people
*06:44.640- 06:50.280* :  have been displaced by the fighting on the border between Lebanon and Israel. From Beirut again,
*06:50.280- 06:57.100* :  Hanna McCarthy reports. Israel says it is at war with Palestinian militants who've launched
*06:57.100- 07:02.980* :  the biggest attack on its territory in years. The total number of dead has reached more than 300.
*07:03.520- 07:08.080* :  Hamas says it has... When the war between Israel and Hamas began on the 7th of October,
*07:08.080- 07:13.440* :  it quickly spread to southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah and Iran backed ally of Hamas,
*07:13.660- 07:18.560* :  began exchanging fire with Israeli forces along the blue line that separates the two countries.
*07:19.160- 07:25.240* :  The war is happening in Gaza, but it's also happening in Lebanon. This is something sometimes people
*07:25.240- 07:30.520* :  forget or it's not very covered in the news. Joseph Sayesh had only just opened Levant,
*07:30.520- 07:35.780* :  a store specializing in Lebanese baked goods in Beirut a few weeks before the war began.
*07:35.780- 07:41.100* :  I lived 10 years in Paris and I got back to Beirut six months ago. Since October,
*07:41.100- 07:46.160* :  tens of thousands of people have fled their homes in southern Lebanon and many countries have
*07:46.160- 07:50.520* :  advised their citizens against traveling to Lebanon with several airlines cutting their flights
*07:50.520- 07:56.540* :  to Beirut. All the foreigners that were in Beirut be it the tourists or the one who were living here
*07:56.540- 08:02.660* :  expats or volunteers with NGOs and they left within days. The lack of flights and foreign visitors
*08:02.660- 08:08.580* :  hit vital tourist revenues, says Sami Zughab, an economist at the policy initiative in Beirut.
*08:08.800- 08:14.700* :  If we had assumed a tourist revenue similar to what we had last year, for example,
*08:14.700- 08:22.080* :  around $1,500 per passenger, we're looking at something closer to around $300 million in losses,
*08:22.340- 08:26.940* :  only from the tourist revenues. He says that fewer flights and visitors have also reduced the
*08:26.940- 08:31.860* :  flow of foreign currency into Lebanon, which has a cash-based economy after its banking sector
*08:32.460- 08:37.000* :  collapsed. Lebanon also imports cash and much of this cash that was being shipped through the
*08:37.000- 08:41.700* :  airport. During the first month of the war, the Lebanese restaurant sector experienced an
*08:41.700- 08:48.580* :  80% drop in business, hedging owners like Joseph Saiege Hard. Sales went down. Coming back here,
*08:48.940- 08:54.160* :  I knew that at some point eventually something would happen. Didn't expect that it would be that
*08:54.160- 08:59.540* :  big and it would be that quick. The holiday season drew some Lebanese expats back from abroad,
*08:59.580- 09:04.900* :  bringing with them fresh dollars and euros. I spoke to Johnny Boomerun, a Lebanese American
*09:04.900- 09:10.020* :  music producer, about how the holiday season had felt in Beirut this year. Things are starting
*09:10.020- 09:17.160* :  to feel a bit normal. Beirut is pretty busy, but not nearly as much as usual. This year feels
*09:17.160- 09:20.580* :  off. Obviously things are uncertain and no one knows what's going to happen.
*09:20.860- 09:25.160* :  Maya Nune, from the syndicate that represents restaurant owners in Lebanon, says that the
*09:25.160- 09:31.100* :  hospitality sector is determined to keep its doors open. The restaurant sector has always been
*09:31.100- 09:37.100* :  one of these sectors that were like really behind the economy in Lebanon. She says they'll keep
*09:37.100- 09:42.700* :  operation as the Hamas-Israel war continues with no end in sight. Anna McCarthy reporting.
*09:43.760- 09:48.760* :  Now Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian air strike on its territory, calling it
*09:48.760- 09:53.640* :  completely unacceptable and warning of serious consequences. It's summoned the Iranian
*09:53.640- 09:59.380* :  Shaji Defeh and lodged a protest as well at the foreign ministry in Tehran. Islamabad said two
*09:59.380- 10:04.220* :  children have been killed in the attack. Our correspondent in Pakistan, Caroline Davis, has more.
*10:04.620- 10:09.960* :  We've had this confirmation now from the foreign ministry here in Pakistan. Now they have said that
*10:09.960- 10:17.300* :  this is a very serious reach of their air space. They are talking about the fact that this will
*10:17.300- 10:22.280* :  have serious consequences. Now this is an explosion that has happened in the area of
*10:22.280- 10:27.400* :  Baluchistan. That is one of the provinces in southwest Pakistan. It's Pakistan's largest province,
*10:27.400- 10:35.760* :  least populated and borders Iran. Now according to Iranian state media, there was a report earlier
*10:35.760- 10:43.380* :  saying that Iran had attacked militants using missiles and a drone strike. They said that
*10:43.860- 10:49.500* :  this had happened in this area. Now at the moment we have seen that those reports according to
*10:49.500- 10:55.440* :  the news agency AFP have since been removed. But we've also now of course had this confirmation
*10:55.440- 11:01.080* :  from Pakistan. They have said that there has been the death so far of two children and three injured
*11:01.500- 11:06.680* :  in what it's referring to as a violation of its air space. Now quite crucially to follow this
*11:06.760- 11:10.860* :  story in the course of the next few hours and days, we have also heard from them that they have
*11:10.860- 11:17.060* :  said that this is unacceptable and can have serious consequences and they say that those consequences
*11:17.100- 11:23.160* :  will light squarely with Iran. Caroline Davis, Ukraine's president for
*11:23.160- 11:28.240* :  Vladimir Zelensky has warned western nations they may face Russian aggression themselves
*11:28.240- 11:33.560* :  if they don't help Ukraine to win the war. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss
*11:33.560- 11:40.480* :  Resort of Davos, Mr. Zelensky appealed for more support. If anyone thinks this is only about
*11:40.480- 11:50.280* :  us, this is only about Ukraine. There are fundamentally mistaken possible directions and even
*11:50.280- 11:56.500* :  timeline of in you Russian aggression beyond Ukraine become more and more obvious.
*11:57.140- 12:02.700* :  Mr. Zelensky also warned against any attempt to freeze the conflict describing the Russian
*12:02.700- 12:07.980* :  president Vladimir Putin as a predator who would never be satisfied. Speaking separately,
*12:07.980- 12:13.920* :  Moscow, Mr. Putin said Russia now had the initiative in the war and Ukraine's statehood could be
*12:13.920- 12:19.480* :  irreparably damaged if it continued. Let's go to the United States now and the presidential election
*12:19.480- 12:25.180* :  due there later this year because the favorite for the Republican nomination Donald Trump appeared
*12:25.180- 12:30.980* :  in a New York court on Tuesday only hours after he swept the Iowa caucuses to cement his position
*12:30.980- 12:36.560* :  as the front runner to become the Republican candidate in November's election. The trial is a
*12:36.560- 12:41.740* :  civil case. The writer E. Jean Carroll is seeking more than 10 million dollars in defamation
*12:41.740- 12:47.700* :  damages. Last year in a separate civil case, a court found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually
*12:47.700- 12:54.820* :  assaulting E. Jean Carroll. So it's been a very busy 24 hours for Donald Trump. He's already moved
*12:54.820- 13:00.000* :  his electoral operations to the next state that will make its choice in the nomination process.
*13:00.000- 13:03.580* :  That's New Hampshire where a big rally is scheduled to take place.
*13:04.180- 13:08.080* :  I spoke to a correspondent, Gary O'Donohue, who's in the U.S., and I asked him
*13:08.360- 13:13.260* :  with all the other material on his plates, did Mr. Trump have to appear in that New York court on
*13:13.260- 13:20.020* :  Tuesday? I think he's found that in some ways showing up has a sort of political upside as well.
*13:20.860- 13:26.040* :  It does tend to raise money for him. He always sends out an accompanying campaign
*13:26.040- 13:31.780* :  fundraising email at the same time and it does bring in dollars. And I think keeping these
*13:31.780- 13:36.680* :  sort of illegal problems in the spotlight for him and whilst he would prefer not to have them,
*13:37.380- 13:43.420* :  they do keep his base motivated as well. So there are some some upsides to facing all these
*13:43.420- 13:48.880* :  various cases around the country. There's no doubt is there that Iowa was a crushing victory for him.
*13:49.000- 13:52.720* :  Yeah, I mean, when you look at any kind of election where you've got multiple candidates and
*13:52.720- 13:58.620* :  someone wins by 30 points, I mean that is a astonishing number. It breaks all sorts of record.
*13:59.160- 14:04.880* :  When you dig into the data, he's also winning in pretty much every demographic group. He's winning
*14:04.880- 14:11.680* :  among men, women, he's winning among the everyone over 30 effectively. He's winning not just
*14:11.680- 14:16.300* :  among non-college educated, which is a big measure here in the United States of voting intention,
*14:16.300- 14:23.320* :  but also college educated, which were he struggled before. So he's really cleaning up at the moment
*14:23.320- 14:28.400* :  and still there are people hanging on in the race like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis has
*14:28.400- 14:32.220* :  been moved on to the New Hampshire next week. Well, let's talk just very quickly about those two.
*14:32.220- 14:35.300* :  I know they do think slightly differently in New Hampshire. It's a primary, I think, isn't it,
*14:35.300- 14:40.920* :  another caucus, but is there any way that Donald Trump is likely to face some serious opposition
*14:40.920- 14:45.100* :  from either of those two? Much narrower gap between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley there. The
*14:45.100- 14:51.080* :  averages have it at about 14 points. Crucially independent voters can vote in that primary.
*14:51.080- 14:56.360* :  They tend to be more moderate and more moderate people tend to support Nikki Haley. So she thinks
*14:56.360- 15:03.220* :  it's now a two-horse race and she says she is the last best chance to stop what she now calls
*15:03.220- 15:09.320* :  not the Biden nightmare, but the Trump Biden nightmare and she's publishing advertising campaigns
*15:09.820- 15:14.060* :  having a go at Trump. Equivalent, you know, making an equivalence between Trump and Biden,
*15:14.060- 15:19.220* :  which is absolutely a new kind of tactic and a new willingness to take on Trump directly.
*15:19.220- 15:25.440* :  Gary O'Donohue on the election trail in the US. Scientists in China say a cloned monkey has lived
*15:25.440- 15:29.940* :  for two years, something they managed to achieve by tweaking the process used to create
*15:30.260- 15:33.580* :  dolly the sheep. The first animal to be successfully cloned.
*15:34.040- 15:39.000* :  Previous attempts to clone primates have not led to live births, or they would see the animal
*15:39.000- 15:43.780* :  only live for a few hours. Well, our science correspondent, Palagosh, has more.
*15:44.260- 15:49.960* :  This is not the first monkey to be cloned, but it's a first recess monkey. The species is used
*15:49.960- 15:54.660* :  in medical research because its physiology is relatively similar to those of humans,
*15:54.660- 16:00.980* :  and so can be used to test new drugs. The reason for creating clone monkeys is that they'd be
*16:00.980- 16:06.240* :  genetically identical, meaning that there'd be less variation in tests carried out on different
*16:06.240- 16:14.240* :  animals, and so experimental results would be more consistent. Researchers created 1113 cloned
*16:14.240- 16:20.460* :  embryos, 11 of which were implanted in surrogate animals, one of which led to a healthy offspring,
*16:20.460- 16:27.040* :  named retro, who's now more than two years old. Palagosh reporting, and in response to some
*16:27.040- 16:32.180* :  criticisms, the Chinese scientists say that all ethical approvals have been obtained for their
*16:35.460- 16:39.540* :  research. Still to calm in this podcast, I think it is going to be interesting to see where the
*16:39.840- 16:44.640* :  novices can possibly tell the difference between the lab grown and the natural diamond.
*16:45.260- 16:48.100* :  But is it true the price of diamonds is falling?
*16:52.180- 16:58.280* :  This is the story of the charismatic Nigerian preacher, TB Joshua. Some called him a miracle worker.
*17:03.000- 17:07.040* :  Others say they knew a very different man. He's not this holy man.
*17:07.300- 17:12.280* :  What happened to me and to others should not happen to any human being.

*18:32.940- 18:37.640* :  Hello again, and welcome back to the Global News podcast. The collapse of the Islamic State
*18:37.640- 18:43.320* :  group in Syria left thousands of women and children from several countries stranded in detention
*18:43.320- 18:48.260* :  camps across the North. Many want to return to their countries of origin, but some governments
*18:48.260- 18:53.860* :  are reluctant. Kegastan is one of the exceptions though. In the last year, the mountainous
*18:53.860- 18:59.220* :  central Asian country has repatriated more than 100 mothers and more than 200 children.
*18:59.220- 19:05.080* :  The United Nations says many of the women were often tricked or lured into going to Syria in the
*19:05.080- 19:11.000* :  first place. Daniel Wittenberg traveled to a reception centre in Kegastan to hear from some of the
*19:11.000- 19:19.720* :  women who did make it home. In the mountains of northern Kegastan, a teacher is addressing a classroom
*19:19.720- 19:25.400* :  of 20 women. He's standing in front of a whiteboard, but this isn't a regular lesson.
*19:26.340- 19:31.660* :  It's a compulsory course in a rehabilitation programme for women who have been brought back
*19:31.660- 19:37.740* :  from detention camps in Syria after years living under IS rule, many say against their will.
*19:39.400- 19:43.160* :  These women and their children will spend six weeks at a centre,
*19:43.600- 19:49.820* :  closely monitored by Kurgi's security services. Guards in camouflage are stationed in the hallways.
*19:52.380- 19:58.580* :  Here they eat, sleep, study religious tolerance and receive psychological support for their trauma.
*19:59.780- 20:06.820* :  At 57, Fatima is the eldest of the arrivals. We've changed her name for her safety. Fatima claims
*20:06.840- 20:12.800* :  she and her children followed her husband to Turkey for work, but ended up being taken to Syria.
*20:13.800- 20:18.300* :  She says she didn't realise she was in a war zone until she heard fighter jets overhead.
*20:21.700- 20:28.140* :  Fatima hopes that her surviving daughter and four grandchildren also repatriated to Kurgistan have a better
*20:28.140- 20:35.820* :  future. Well, I'm already a pensioner, but I'm glad my grandchildren can have an education.
*20:36.720- 20:41.040* :  I want them to study science to understand the world better. They've seen so little.
*20:43.660- 20:49.020* :  After they leave the centre, the women face a new challenge, reintegrating into their communities.
*20:51.580- 20:56.980* :  In a town outside the capital Bishkek, we meet Elmira, also not her real name.
*20:58.000- 21:01.920* :  She's in the kitchen with her mother and her nine-year-old daughter, who struts
*21:01.920- 21:08.580* :  cheekily in and out of our interview. Elmira claims she was tricked into traveling to Syria.
*21:09.260- 21:13.480* :  Four days after her 18th birthday, by a man she fell in love with online.
*21:14.520- 21:19.880* :  She's been back at home for a few months and is worried about the public reaction to women in her
*21:19.880- 21:26.260* :  position. It isn't pleasant. A lot of us don't understand why they're afraid of us.
*21:26.400- 21:32.280* :  We are afraid of them. People think we have come back here with machine guns and suicide belts.
*21:32.300- 21:38.060* :  It's not like that. We are people just like they are. We also have families,
*21:38.060- 21:44.520* :  and we also want to live peaceful and happy lives. Many people in Kyrgyzstan are worried about
*21:44.520- 21:51.040* :  extremism, especially after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan. These women were fearful.
*21:52.260- 21:57.120* :  They get used to the ISIS way of life. They could commit terrorist acts like bombings.
*21:57.820- 22:02.640* :  Menloem, personally, I think that not everyone who has been to Syria is dangerous.
*22:03.420- 22:08.520* :  But some people, they will have got used to the mentality of ISIS, and they might try to
*22:08.520- 22:14.140* :  radicalize people here. Despite these concerns from a mostly Muslim population,
*22:14.220- 22:19.920* :  we asked the deputy prime minister, Adeel Bizarrov, why the government has adopted a more
*22:19.920- 22:23.720* :  open policy of rehabilitation than some western countries.
*22:24.120- 22:30.500* :  You know, it wasn't an easy decision. Of course, our kind of Islam is not radical.
*22:30.500- 22:37.680* :  We are small nations that need to take care of each other, even of those who commit mistakes.
*22:39.600- 22:44.220* :  Most of the women do still face an investigation into their time spent under ISIS.
*22:45.000- 22:50.780* :  But unlike the nearly 50,000 people who remain in Syrian camps, they have the opportunity of a
*22:50.780- 22:57.020* :  second chance at life back home. Daniel Wittenberg, reporting. We're going to go to Kenya now,
*22:57.180- 23:01.960* :  where authorities are to tighten rules on rented accommodation. It comes after two women were
*23:01.960- 23:07.600* :  murdered in apartments in the last two weeks. According to a local police report, one of those
*23:07.600- 23:13.580* :  women was dismembered and her remains were stuffed into a plastic bag. Now, many Kenyans have taken
*23:13.580- 23:19.680* :  to social media to speak out against what they say is a deep-rooted culture of misogyny in the country.
*23:20.520- 23:25.500* :  But Will Ross, our African editor, told me the story has also sparked an opposite reaction.
*23:25.920- 23:33.520* :  This is a phenomenon really that's come up on social media, where people are saying that
*23:34.260- 23:39.500* :  instead of blaming the attacker, the murderer, they're kind of blaming the women. And in these
*23:39.500- 23:46.240* :  two cases, they're suggesting that the women went to meet the men in these flats because they
*23:46.240- 23:52.680* :  were after money. And they're then saying that it's their fault for falling into a trap. It's their
*23:52.680- 23:59.300* :  fault for having loose morals. They're using that kind of language. And there's been a lot of
*23:59.300- 24:05.980* :  arguing back and forth. And Amnesty International's executive director, Irungu Houton, has also been
*24:05.980- 24:12.540* :  speaking about this phenomenon. And he said that these comments online were not simply isolated
*24:12.560- 24:19.060* :  cases of misogynistic men, but were indicative of a broader culture of woman hating.
*24:19.840- 24:26.120* :  They do seem to be some statistics as well that reveal the extent of a much broader problem
*24:26.640- 24:31.700* :  in Kenyans society about physical violence aimed at women. I mean, some of these figures are
*24:31.700- 24:37.260* :  quite breathtaking, aren't they? They are. There was a survey done last year, which said just over a
*24:37.260- 24:43.660* :  third of women who responded said they had experienced physical violence. That was a survey
*24:43.660- 24:49.620* :  last year. And I'm sure it's far worse than any police statistics would ever throw up because so
*24:49.620- 24:55.680* :  many women and girls would be too scared to report anything. Well, we've got a kind of an administrative
*24:55.680- 25:02.080* :  solution to these, I mean, awful violent killings in terms of identification when it comes to
*25:02.080- 25:06.800* :  hiring these apartments. But what about other proposals going forward to try to end this
*25:06.800- 25:11.740* :  kind of violence aimed at women? Well, there's a Kenyan government run entity called the
*25:11.740- 25:18.120* :  private security regulator. And it's put out a statement ordering all providers of accommodation.
*25:18.120- 25:24.220* :  And it requires them to hold on to identification documents, whether that's a driving license
*25:24.220- 25:29.880* :  and ID card or a passport, to hold on to those documents of all the guests until they check out.
*25:30.400- 25:35.680* :  But it's hard to see how they would be able to really police that because I think in many cases,
*25:36.620- 25:41.300* :  the people renting out the flat don't even meet the people who are lodging there. And they're also
*25:41.300- 25:48.440* :  calls for all cars that are going in and out of these areas where the flats are to be recorded.
*25:48.440- 25:53.520* :  But who would do that? These apartment blocks often have a security company that are nothing
*25:53.520- 25:58.580* :  to do with the person that's renting out the flat and also calls for all security cameras to be
*25:58.580- 26:04.080* :  checked that they're working better. Well, Ross reporting here in the UK, two of the deputy
*26:04.080- 26:08.980* :  chairman of Britain's governing conservative party have resigned after they backed amendments
*26:08.980- 26:15.280* :  that sought to change a controversial new law allowing the deportation of asylum seekers to
*26:15.280- 26:21.160* :  Rwanda. Leanderson and Brendan Clark Smith felt that the proposed legislation wasn't tough enough.
*26:21.840- 26:26.280* :  Our political editor, Chris Mason, explains. They make the point, and this is one we've heard from
*26:26.640- 26:30.340* :  a good number of conservative backbenchers this afternoon, that the government's had two previous
*26:30.340- 26:36.120* :  attempts to make a new law work as far as the Rwanda plan is concerned. And they have failed.
*26:36.120- 26:41.620* :  And in the view of these two now former deputy chairman, they want to be able to back the changes
*26:41.620- 26:46.120* :  that they think toughen up the government's plans because they think that would give it a greater
*26:46.120- 26:50.060* :  chance of success. That's something that government ministers would dispute.
*26:50.820- 26:55.560* :  Chris Mason, well, staying here in the UK, the story that's been dominating the news in this
*26:55.560- 27:00.340* :  country for the past few weeks has concerned the post office and how hundreds of people that
*27:00.340- 27:05.780* :  worked for it have been wrongly convicted of fraud or theft. And it all happened because of a
*27:05.780- 27:10.760* :  faulty computer software system. Some of those caught up in the national scandal even took their
*27:10.760- 27:16.260* :  own lives. The global IT firm Fujitsu, which made the software, has been coming under intense
*27:16.260- 27:23.160* :  pressure and now its chief executive has apologised. The BBC found Takahito Tokita and spoke to him
*27:23.160- 27:27.020* :  at the annual economic forum in Davos. Would you like to apologise?
*27:27.920- 27:32.380* :  Yes, of course, of course, Fujitsu has apologised.
*27:33.080- 27:40.360* :  Devastating the impact on the post office's lives and their families.
*27:40.860- 27:44.140* :  What do you think about Fujitsu giving the money back the government suggested that you should
*27:44.500- 27:44.980* :  return the money?
*27:45.360- 27:51.960* :  We understand the ongoing and the public inquiry. I'm sorry, I cannot comment.
*27:52.820- 27:57.420* :  So an apology, but no details on the money from Fujitsu's chief executive.
*27:57.880- 28:01.880* :  Well, answering questions from members of Parliament here in London, Fujitsu's boss in Europe,
*28:01.880- 28:04.080* :  Paul Patterson, actually went further.
*28:04.540- 28:10.440* :  The inquiry is dealing with some very complex matters over this. There are moral obligation,
*28:10.440- 28:16.400* :  Mr. Patterson, for you to contribute. I think there is a moral obligation for the company to
*28:16.400- 28:23.380* :  contribute and I think the right place to determine that is when our responsibility is very clear.
*28:23.600- 28:27.300* :  There are many parties involved in this travesty.
*28:28.220- 28:32.340* :  Well, having heard all of that, I asked our political correspondent Rob Watson if there
*28:32.340- 28:35.920* :  was significance in these two comments or were they just window dressing?
*28:36.380- 28:41.240* :  No, I think there is significance in that problem because the government is estimating that
*28:41.240- 28:45.840* :  this is going to cost in compensation, perhaps over a billion dollars.
*28:46.100- 28:49.700* :  And obviously that money has got to come from somewhere and I think the government is thinking
*28:49.700- 28:54.280* :  some of it should come from the post office and another big chunk from Fujitsu.
*28:54.540- 28:58.200* :  What about what happens next? There is a public inquiry, a big thing, I've lost a couple of weeks
*28:58.200- 29:02.420* :  about a TV drama that caught a lot of attention. What's actually happening next in the process
*29:02.420- 29:03.580* :  and that compensation?
*29:03.900- 29:08.380* :  As you say, there's a police investigation, there's a public inquiry into what went wrong.
*29:08.380- 29:12.560* :  There are parliamentary hearings as we just dipped into and got some of.
*29:12.640- 29:16.460* :  And interestingly, of course, the government in reactions, the sort of public,
*29:16.460- 29:22.300* :  total extraordinary public outcry at the TV drama is saying that it's going to pass a law that
*29:22.300- 29:27.940* :  essentially will say, look, we're going to bypass the courts and just declare everybody who
*29:27.940- 29:30.080* :  has found guilty, we're just going to exonerate them.
*29:30.380- 29:35.120* :  And we're also going to set up a sort of rapid compensation system because again,
*29:35.120- 29:40.400* :  one of the reasons why this, I think, is just infuriated people is beyond that sort of sense
*29:40.400- 29:45.440* :  that it all chimes with a broader mood of national malaise in this country that nothing works.
*29:45.440- 29:50.420* :  I mean, people were just, the public are just shocked that all these poor postmasters and
*29:50.420- 29:56.000* :  mistresses, many of them still haven't been paid, haven't got compensation and haven't been cleared.
*29:56.880- 30:01.120* :  Rob Watson reporting. Now, here's a sparkly ender to the podcast for you.
*30:01.240- 30:05.640* :  Around the globe, inflation has hit many millions of households and the cost of living
*30:05.640- 30:10.420* :  crisis is not yet over. But one thing at least that is coming down in price is diamonds.
*30:11.140- 30:15.920* :  The Debea's company, which has massive sway in the global diamond market, is cutting prices,
*30:15.920- 30:20.880* :  partly because of the current cost of living crisis. People just won't pay as much for diamonds.
*30:20.960- 30:27.500* :  But there is another particular issue for Debea's. Diamonds can now be grown in laps and to a very
*30:27.500- 30:33.160* :  high quality. So, naturally occurring diamonds have some competition with the supply of jewels,
*30:33.160- 30:37.740* :  not as constrained as it was. My colleague, Evan Davis, spoke to the diamond specialist,
*30:37.740- 30:43.000* :  Jackie Larson. She came into the BBC studios here with some gems to see if one can tell the
*30:43.000- 30:48.300* :  difference between the natural diamonds and those that are man-made, grown in the lab. Before that,
*30:48.300- 30:51.900* :  though, Evan asked her to what extent Debea's can set the price of diamonds.
*30:52.320- 30:55.980* :  Well, I think if you're talking back to the 90s, they really were the dominant fourth.
*30:56.480- 31:00.560* :  But in more recent times, actually things have changed considerably.
*31:01.500- 31:07.240* :  About a third of the diamond market actually comes from Russia, hence a lot of movement in the
*31:07.240- 31:12.660* :  price. So, soon after the outbreak of the Ukraine war, diamond prices really surged,
*31:13.360- 31:17.540* :  because I think there was a lot of concern that the supply was going to tighten up.
*31:18.580- 31:24.060* :  And then more recently, they've softened considerably. But Debea's really doesn't have quite,
*31:24.060- 31:27.820* :  they can't exercise that same level of control that they used to when they
*31:27.820- 31:32.100* :  commanded sort of 80% or thereabouts of the market, which they just don't do now.
*31:32.580- 31:36.220* :  Now, part of the suggestion of what has been going on is that there is more competition
*31:36.340- 31:41.800* :  from lab-grown diamonds. I think we should just establish what a lab-grown diamond is.
*31:41.860- 31:45.240* :  I mean, diamond is pure, pure carbon, right, in a crystal form.
*31:45.780- 31:50.720* :  When you talk about a natural diamond, so one which has been mined versus a lab-grown,
*31:50.720- 31:56.820* :  so one that's been synthesised in a factory, it is still a diamond. It has the same physical
*31:56.820- 32:04.940* :  and optical properties, so of course it behaves in exactly the same way. But the price of lab-grown
*32:04.940- 32:12.780* :  has de-escalated so enormously recently. So, at the last National Association of Jewels conference,
*32:12.780- 32:20.240* :  I think lab-grown were about 90% less than the value of the natural counterparts. So, that's
*32:20.240- 32:26.480* :  really substantial. So, as a consumer, that's quite a difficult... You can see why that might
*32:26.480- 32:31.160* :  drag the price of the natural diamonds down. But you have to understand that they are also
*32:31.160- 32:37.260* :  two completely different value propositions. And important you make that. Well, look, I think it
*32:37.500- 32:42.180* :  is going to be interesting to see where the novices can possibly tell the difference between
*32:42.180- 32:46.840* :  the lab-grown and the natural diamond. And I know you've got some diamonds with you.
*32:47.100- 32:52.080* :  I have. And you have what they call a loop, which is the little eyepiece that you can use to...
*32:52.460- 32:57.580* :  Well, you're very welcome to use this as well. So, a loop is an instrument that is almost like the
*32:57.580- 33:02.820* :  first thing that we would reach for, and really all assessments of diamonds is done at ten times
*33:02.820- 33:08.340* :  magnification. So, it's the thing. So, we've got... These are all embedded in jewelry as we...
*33:08.340- 33:14.800* :  So, that's... Yeah, so we've got a rose gold stretchy bracelet that's got some harvester diamonds.
*33:15.520- 33:21.800* :  Jackie has just given Evan a ring, a necklace, a bracelet, and some earrings. Only the earrings
*33:21.800- 33:26.560* :  have lab-grown diamonds in them. The rest are all natural. Yeah, I just thought if I only brought
*33:26.560- 33:30.940* :  in two, it was kind of cheating, because you've... Fifty-fifty. Exactly. I just wanted to make a
*33:30.940- 33:36.440* :  little bit more challenging for you. Right. Just glancing at them. It's obviously not possible for me
*33:36.440- 33:41.900* :  to tell. Now, I'm going to hold up... I mean, honestly... Do you think you're looking for...
*33:41.900- 33:46.840* :  And how do you feel doing this? I think I'm looking for the sort of purity of the tilt, the...
*33:47.420- 33:54.580* :  not the cups, the angles. What's interesting is that the quality of the lab-grown diamonds now
*33:54.580- 34:02.560* :  is extremely high. The stones are of such quality that they're a beautiful colour, very clean stones.
*34:02.560- 34:08.780* :  I'm guessing the ring is lab-grown, but it's funny enough that one I thought was least interesting
*34:08.780- 34:14.520* :  was the earring. But I just... I think that just looks like a real diamond to me, even though it's
*34:14.720- 34:21.020* :  a bit less sparkly. The ring is about a £50,000. Beautiful cushion cut, natural
*34:21.020- 34:28.480* :  diamond. Okay, so... But you were right with the earring drop. The pear cut is the lab-grown,
*34:28.940- 34:33.000* :  but frankly, if I showed it to you next to a natural pear cut, you wouldn't be able to tell
*34:33.000- 34:37.500* :  the difference. Oh, that's interesting. Okay. Well, look, the next question, and this is the
*34:37.500- 34:41.480* :  really important philosophical question that comes out of this. If we can't really tell the
*34:41.480- 34:46.080* :  difference, does it matter? Why don't I just buy a lab-grown diamond at 10% of the price of the
*34:46.760- 34:52.900* :  the natural one? Well, that would largely explain the fact that for the first time last year,
*34:52.900- 34:59.000* :  over 50% of the bridal market featured lab-grown diamonds. You'd be kidding yourself if you
*34:59.000- 35:05.220* :  thought it wasn't an important part of the market. It is. But I think what is essential is that
*35:05.220- 35:10.900* :  consumers are very clear from a value point of view what they're guessing, because there is
*35:10.900- 35:17.680* :  absolutely no secondary value with a lab-grown diamond. That was the diamond specialist,
*35:18.120- 35:22.680* :  Jackie Larson, talking to my colleague, but not quite a diamond expert, Evan Davis.
*35:26.100- 35:29.380* :  Well, that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast.
