*00:00.000- 00:03.240* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.440- 00:06.600* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*00:06.600- 00:09.760* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Friday the 5th of January.
*00:09.760- 00:14.740* :  The US says North Korea has supplied Russia with ballistic missiles that have been used against Ukraine.
*00:14.740- 00:19.760* :  This is a significant and concerning escalation in the DPRK's support for Russia.
*00:20.240- 00:24.700* :  The most effective response is to continue to provide Ukraine with vital air defense capabilities
*00:24.700- 00:26.440* :  and other types of military equipment.
*00:26.860- 00:33.500* :  The UN Human Rights Chief expresses alarm at calls from some Israeli leaders that Palestinian should leave Gaza altogether.
*00:34.380- 00:39.980* :  And the Vatican issues a statement to try to reassure Catholic bishops who oppose blessings for same-sex couples.
*00:42.680- 00:49.200* :  Also in the podcast, an MP in Italy's governing party is suspended after his gun goes off at a New Year's Eve party.
*00:54.820- 00:57.560* :  The AI bringing Elvis back to life.
*01:01.380- 01:10.000* :  In the 22 months since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has used up huge amounts of munitions and turned to allies like Iran for supplies.
*01:10.720- 01:15.600* :  Now the US has accused North Korea of giving Russia ballistic missiles and launches.
*01:16.240- 01:20.800* :  The White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said newly declassified intelligence
*01:20.800- 01:23.720* :  showed Russia had recently used the missiles in action.
*01:24.120- 01:31.180* :  On this 30th of December, 2023, Russian forces launched at least one of these North Korean ballistic missiles into Ukraine.
*01:31.180- 01:35.900* :  This missile appears to have landed in an open field in the Zaparitia region.
*01:36.220- 01:43.220* :  And on January 2nd, Russia launched multiple North Korean ballistic missiles into Ukraine, including as part of its overnight aerial attack.
*01:43.860- 01:49.560* :  I had more about the details provided by John Kirby from our correspondent Will Vernon in Washington.
*01:50.060- 01:54.020* :  John Kirby called this a significant and concerning escalation.
*01:54.020- 01:59.940* :  He said that Russia had recently received missile launchers and several ballistic missiles from North Korea
*01:59.940- 02:07.720* :  and he told reporters at that White House briefing that Moscow's forces launched a number of these missiles during attacks on Ukraine in recent days.
*02:08.280- 02:13.360* :  One missile was launched, he said, on the 30th of December, but it landed in an open field.
*02:13.360- 02:19.260* :  And multiple ballistic missiles were then fired into Ukraine as part of a mass aerial attack.
*02:19.260- 02:28.960* :  Several days later and we all remember, don't we, those large-scale attacks that Russia launched on Ukrainian towns and cities over the New Year period.
*02:29.060- 02:33.080* :  Now the US has previously accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons.
*02:33.080- 02:37.900* :  But this is the first time that US intelligence has shared details about ballistic missiles.
*02:38.220- 02:44.440* :  So these are self-guided rockets that Mr. Kirby said can reach targets 900 kilometers away.
*02:44.720- 02:49.480* :  Now we suspect that there were links between North Korea and Russia.
*02:49.480- 02:57.020* :  We saw various visits between the two nations. Why is the US making this public now? And what does it intend to do about it?
*02:57.200- 03:12.500* :  Mr. Kirby said that Washington will take a range of steps. The United States and its allies will raise the matter at the UN Security Council and will impose additional sanctions against those working to facilitate arms transfers between Russia and North Korea.
*03:12.500- 03:28.320* :  And Mr. Kirby claimed that sanctions that are already in place targeting Moscow are the very reason that Russia has been forced to sort of shop around as it were has had to turn to Pyongyang for weapons because Russia has become increasingly isolated on the world stage.
*03:28.500- 03:40.960* :  But Mr. Kirby also said that they will continue to release information to the public because he said that they wanted to expose these arms deals, that they didn't want to allow countries to aid Russia's war machine as he called it in secret.
*03:41.360- 03:47.100* :  And I guess it also underlines the Biden argument that it needs to support its ally Ukraine.
*03:47.100- 04:09.100* :  That's right Mr. Kirby outlined again that it's the US Congress that needs to step up as he said and respond by providing Ukraine with what they need because less we forget 50 billion dollars of military aid to Ukraine is still stuck in Congress whilst Republicans and Democrats argue many Democrats have been clear that it's time to help Ukraine and that that additional funding needs to be provided.
*04:09.600- 04:19.460* :  We'll Vernon in Washington with the conflict between Israel and Hamas nearly three months old America's top diplomats Anthony Blinken is heading back to the region.
*04:19.460- 04:26.480* :  A US official said he would push for additional steps on what the Palestinian territory of Gaza will look like at the end of the fighting.
*04:26.480- 04:33.480* :  That has been complicated by the killing of the Hamas leader Salah Aruri in a suspected Israeli drone strike in Lebanon.
*04:33.480- 04:37.120* :  As I heard from our correspondent in the occupied West Bank.
*04:38.580- 04:45.140* :  I think you were unclear before about what Gaza will be like or look like or how it will be governed after the war.
*04:45.140- 04:50.600* :  I think we're much more unclear now. First of all because of who died and where he died.
*04:51.000- 05:03.160* :  Salah Aruri was again a key figure when it came to dealings with prisoner swaps with Israel and he was set to be an important figure in those negotiations with Israel about hostage releases.
*05:03.160- 05:10.040* :  After the killing there were reports in Arab media that Egypt has essentially suspended its mediation efforts.
*05:10.040- 05:23.700* :  Remember a few days before this we were reporting about this three-tier proposal by Egypt that could see a gradual release of hostages, different periods of pause in the fighting that could see humanitarian aid come in.
*05:24.020- 05:34.080* :  And at the same time we're seeing these comments this week from these two far-right members of the Israeli government basically saying they want to kick the Palestinians out of Gaza altogether.
*05:34.080- 05:37.260* :  That's getting some pushback from the UN Human Rights Chief.
*05:37.340- 05:43.980* :  The two people that you're talking about are finance, minister Bezal al-Smotrich and national security minister Iqmar Ben-Givir.
*05:44.040- 05:51.940* :  And these are part of the far-right Benjamin Netanyahu's government that many here in Israel have disagreed with on many other points.
*05:52.500- 06:07.760* :  They have been described as inflammatory and irresponsible comments and remember also that they come in contrast with the official Israeli government line about what happens in Gaza because the official line has been that people could return to their homes after the war is over.
*06:08.300- 06:17.660* :  Jamal, hello in Ramallah. Meanwhile in Iran there has been a day of mourning for the victims of twin bombings which left at least 84 people dead.
*06:17.660- 06:25.480* :  The blasts targeted a memorial event for General Kasim Sulamani four years after he was killed by a U.S. drone in Iraq.
*06:26.320- 06:32.880* :  Iran hinted that it thought Israel or the United States was to blame for the explosions in the Iranian city of Khaman on Wednesday.
*06:33.560- 06:41.160* :  But now the jihadist Sunni group Islamic State says it carried out the attacks. This is the U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
*06:41.640- 06:45.320* :  Based on all the information available it's clear to us that this was a terrorist attack.
*06:45.320- 06:54.760* :  We've seen the reports that ISIS has taken responsibility for it. I will say I'm not ready to offer a formal assessment from this podium at this time when it comes to responsibility.
*06:54.760- 06:57.940* :  But this attack does bear all the hallmarks of an ISIS attack.
*06:58.400- 07:04.480* :  Our chief international correspondent Lee Stusset told Luke Jones more about what ISIS had to say.
*07:04.760- 07:14.440* :  In an statement it described them as his martyrdom seeking brothers that they headed toward the gathering and then they detonated their suicide belts among the gathering.
*07:14.440- 07:24.840* :  They said killing or wounding more than 300. The figure we have, remember yesterday it was as high as 100 today the Iranian authorities have brought it down to 84.
*07:24.840- 07:35.860* :  But at the same time pro-government websites in Iran have put out what one pro-government outlet described it as exclusive photos saying that there were two suicide bombings.
*07:35.860- 07:50.900* :  A man and a woman. The story there and also being reported by Irina the official government news agency saying that when the man with the backpack was stopped by security forces he detonated the explosives in his bag and then the woman detonated hers.
*07:51.140- 08:06.740* :  That doesn't chime with what Islamic State group has said. They said two men. I think we have to be very cautious because I know from my work in Afghanistan that sometimes Islamic State claims responsibility for something and we know from elsewhere in the Middle East as well.
*08:06.740- 08:23.500* :  Thinking it's safe to do it because no one else will and in fact it's not them at all. Behind this of course are the accusations coming from some Iranian officials yesterday that in fact it was the work of Israel back by the United States which has been completely rejected by Israel and also by the United States.
*08:23.540- 08:35.120* :  If we move on to Beirut the funeral of that Hamas deputy leader Salah Ul-Auriri. Big crowds many of them angry. Do we have any more clarity on what actually happened there either?
*08:35.340- 08:51.020* :  We should underline the attacks in Iran during a ceremony for Qasim Soleimani. This does not seem to be linked to the funeral today in Lebanon emotional scenes and that is an assassination. No one has taken responsibility.
*08:51.100- 09:03.340* :  It's widely believed it was carried out by Israel. Israel never confirms or denies operations of this kind but have made it absolutely clear in recent months that they will go after Hamas leaders.
*09:03.340- 09:12.940* :  No matter where they are. What should we make of his ballers response so far? This threat of reprisals? What on earth could we be expecting?
*09:13.460- 09:27.260* :  Al-Hasan Asrallah the Hezbollah leader gave a speech yesterday. It was meant to mark the killing of Qasim Soleimani not the don't the assassination of the deputy leader of Hamas but of course because of the timing and the coincidence.
*09:27.260- 09:34.300* :  He made it absolutely clear there would be an answer to the killing but he didn't make any direct threat.
*09:34.620- 09:43.460* :  And while again going back to the sense that this was an escalation for a deputy Hamas leader to be killed in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
*09:43.460- 09:57.480* :  What we have seen since the beginning of the October 7th Israel Gaza war is that his baller and its Iranian allies while they express solidarity with Hamas have been keeping alive.
*09:57.480- 10:10.920* :  Low intensity responses to it that neither them would want to carry out some kind of retaliatory attack which would then precipitate an even greater Israeli response.
*10:10.920- 10:24.740* :  Hezbollah and Iran indeed Lebanon saw the kind of damage that Israel can inflict they saw during the 2006 Lebanon Israel war and they would not want to be dragged into another conflagration.
*10:24.740- 10:45.420* :  And in particular while there is widespread support for the Palestinian cause widespread anguish over the staggering number of civilian casualties in Gaza the widespread devastation deep worries about the future of Gaza and the Palestinian cause directly they themselves do not want to play a part in this war.
*10:45.480- 10:49.300* :  It is not their war while they still feel connected for many many reasons.
*10:49.840- 10:59.280* :  Lee's dessert well in Gaza health officials say 125 Palestinians were killed in the 24 hours to Thursday as Israeli forces continued their offensive.
*10:59.980- 11:13.560* :  14 people including 9 children were reportedly killed in the small town of Al-Mawasi in the south of Gaza which had been declared a safe space by Israel for the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the fighting.
*11:13.560- 11:17.500* :  This survivor Jamal Hamad Salah described what happened.
*11:20.140- 11:30.800* :  We were sleeping at midnight when a strike hit the camp on the 4x2 tents where people were sleeping most of them children we found one body there that flew 40 meters away where is the humanity.
*11:31.460- 11:39.560* :  Mahmoud Salah is the uncle of one of those killed in the attack he also expressed anger at the international community for not doing enough to stop the killings.
*11:40.500- 11:54.380* :  Where is international law there is no law they killed children children they are getting shelled as they are sleeping they are bombing them killing them with what blood what blood.
*11:55.100- 12:03.100* :  The British orthopedic surgeon Graham groom arrived in Gaza last week with the ideals charity using his holidays to work there.
*12:03.100- 12:09.040* :  He told Sarah Montague more about the job he's been doing at the European Gaza hospital in Hanunis.
*12:09.380- 12:16.200* :  We've been seeing the ones that we've been asked to see we've been making our operating lists we've been operating on them as appropriate.
*12:17.200- 12:26.280* :  That sounds calm and planned and progressive it's anything but we now have 21 operations in 15 patients.
*12:27.140- 12:47.820* :  Background is dominated by the misery and suffering of the people that come through the theatre especially the children on our list today will have had six children all of them dreadfully injured in explosions with their lives changed forever and of course in the holding bay and the recovery area.
*12:48.420- 12:53.440* :  The dominant background noise is their cries and occasionally screams.
*12:53.840- 13:17.000* :  How safe have you felt given what happened we felt embarrassingly completely safe all around us as part of the background noise above the wailing of the children as occasional bombs to bank fire artillery fire automatic weapons and we really know that it's very very unlikely that any of it will come our way.
*13:17.600- 13:21.100* :  But when you hear a bomb do you think I will see the effects of that tomorrow.
*13:21.580- 13:46.260* :  Even before yesterday we did we were doing around we went back to a theatre to arrange the list for the following day and two theatres were occupied by a pair of brothers 16 and 18 are pulling the injured and they had been the victims of a bomb that we had heard 20 minutes earlier one had a hypnotist articulation amputation and other ghastly injuries.
*13:46.980- 13:55.620* :  The other one had his side completely flayed and sadly in spite of all that everyone could do better than died the next day.
*13:56.200- 13:59.640* :  And the children that you're seeing do you think about what their futures hold.
*13:59.840- 14:12.940* :  Absolutely the child that came last night who was transferred from another hospital to us he's the only survivor of a bomb that killed basis parents in six of his brothers and sisters.
*14:13.660- 14:19.880* :  So it's not only the wounds that will have a life changing effect on him. It's the loss of his immediate family.
*14:20.180- 14:25.740* :  You are incredibly busy and I don't think you normally do interviews. Why did you agree to these interviews?
*14:26.140- 14:31.800* :  Because I think this war in Gaza is absolutely different from all that have gone before.
*14:31.800- 14:42.680* :  If we consider conflicts all around the world I think that this one illustrates more vividly than any other the cruelty and cowardice of modern war.
*14:43.760- 14:47.480* :  Orthopedic surgeon Graham Grume talking to Sarah Montague.
*14:48.840- 14:59.060* :  The former South African Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius is due to leave prison on Friday after being granted parole more than ten years after killing his girlfriend, Riva Steenkamp.
*14:59.060- 15:05.760* :  Pistorius has served just over half of his jail sentence following a crime and trial that dominated international headlines.
*15:05.760- 15:08.780* :  Daniel Desemoon sent this report from Pretoria.
*15:10.320- 15:16.700* :  And they're under way there in the last of the finals after Paralympic games and a terrific start by Oscar Pistorius.
*15:17.720- 15:22.840* :  Oscar Pistorius wants a Paralympic and Olympic superstar nicknamed the Blade Runner.
*15:23.440- 15:32.000* :  Now convicted murderer today he leaves prison on parole. His victim was girlfriend Riva Steenkamp, a law graduate and model.
*15:32.500- 15:40.300* :  Pistorius murdered her on Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting four times through a locked toilet door at his Pretoria home.
*15:43.560- 15:51.080* :  His trial absorbed the world. Pistorius claimed to have shot Riva Steenkamp by mistake thinking intruder was in the house.
*15:51.580- 15:55.620* :  I got to the bed. You know, I realized she wasn't there.
*15:56.080- 16:05.940* :  At first found guilty of the equivalent of manslaughter he was convicted on a pill in 2015 of murder with judges saying his story was inconsistent and improbable.
*16:06.480- 16:12.720* :  Gwynne Guscott, a close friend of Riva Steenkamp, says she's heard no evidence Pistorius has changed in prison.
*16:13.120- 16:17.340* :  For me, I want to know, has he been given proper anger management therapy?
*16:17.800- 16:33.720* :  And in saying that this rehabilitation have they focused on all of that because in my opinion, Oscar walking around as a free man without the necessary training and treatments and psychiatric evaluations, he is deadly on the streets.
*16:34.160- 16:38.280* :  In November, Pistorius was granted parole with release set for today.
*16:38.500- 16:45.540* :  For five years, he'll live under conditions, including not speaking to the media and can be returned to prison if he breaches them.
*16:45.540- 16:53.680* :  Below were Adonis of South African anti male violence campaigners Women for Change says his release sends a terrible signal.
*16:53.680- 17:05.920* :  Oscar's release is an indication that we have a serious problem that there's a normalization of leniency when it comes to predators, when it comes to anyone who commits any type of homicide or gender-based violence.
*17:05.920- 17:12.380* :  Riva Steenkamp's mother says the void left by her murder can never be filled by anyone else.
*17:12.760- 17:14.840* :  Daniel Dismont reporting from Pretoria.
*17:15.480- 17:24.520* :  Fans of Elvis Presley may get the chance to see the king of rock and roll perform once again in the form of an AI-generated holographic projection.
*17:24.520- 17:32.700* :  The performance called Elvis Evolution will take place later this year in London, almost half a century after he died at the age of 42.
*17:33.480- 17:39.620* :  Our media and arts correspondent David Silito has been looking into the show that will leave fans all shook up.
*17:45.500- 18:00.160* :  Elvis never played the UK while it was alive. However, 46 years after his death, he's on his way back into the building, or rather an AI-generated 3D holographic Elvis.
*18:00.160- 18:08.880* :  However, no images have yet been released. The technology is, it's said, still being developed according to the man creating this new immersive show.
*18:09.100- 18:11.740* :  Andrew McGinnis from the company Laird Reality.
*18:12.100- 18:23.180* :  What we're working with is thousands of thousands of photos that we've got exclusive access to, home video footage, and all of that's getting fed into an AI model to help create an Elvis that will be able to perform in front of you.
*18:23.440- 18:25.380* :  What AI can do is moving at real pace.
*18:25.680- 18:32.900* :  It is, of course, far from the first hologram concert, a ghostly two-packed Shakur appeared on stage in America 11 years ago.
*18:32.900- 18:41.940* :  Maria Callis, or rather a digitally-enhanced Maria Callis look-alike, has also gone on tour, has his Whitney Houston eight years after her death.
*18:41.940- 18:49.120* :  But for music technology writer Aiman Ford, everything changed with Abbas Avatar show in London.
*18:49.420- 18:55.780* :  The big leap forward was probably Abba Voyage, simply because of the scale of the technology.
*18:56.820- 19:02.200* :  The incredible likeness that they were able to reproduce, obviously, they were working with live and artist.
*19:02.200- 19:07.980* :  But I just think the technology that they have on Abba Voyage is astonishing, really.
*19:07.980- 19:10.840* :  It probably creates a template for others to follow.
*19:11.140- 19:18.060* :  And from music industry in which many of its biggest acts have either stopped touring or are nearing the end, the attraction is obvious.
*19:18.460- 19:22.220* :  The band Kiss announced their first farewell tour in the year 2000.
*19:22.220- 19:30.200* :  And in a concert in December 2023, assured the world that this really was the end by introducing Avatar Kiss.
*19:32.740- 19:34.260* :  That report by David Silito.
*19:36.980- 19:39.120* :  And still to come on the Global News Podcast.
*19:40.220- 19:44.480* :  You know, you only get four seconds and they've already changed their minds, but they can't do anything about it.
*19:45.240- 19:49.080* :  Why one of the world's most famous landmarks is getting a safety net.
*19:57.520- 20:02.940* :  Last month, the Vatican issued an eight-page declaration approving blessings for same-sex couples.
*20:03.540- 20:07.080* :  The latest attempt by Pope Francis to make the Catholic Church more inclusive.
*20:07.680- 20:12.160* :  However, it hasn't gone down well with some Catholic bishops, particularly in Africa,
*20:12.720- 20:15.540* :  who were unhappy at what they saw as a doctrinal change.
*20:15.540- 20:23.660* :  Now, the church has issued a five-page clarification, acknowledging that such blessings could be problematic in more conservative societies,
*20:23.660- 20:30.380* :  but stressing that they are not heretical or blasphemous, as I heard from our African regional editor, David Bamford.
*20:30.700- 20:37.100* :  Well, as you know, the Pope Francis was keen to put forward the blessings for same-sex couples in late December.
*20:37.760- 20:41.640* :  In his clarification, there was issue today, his doctrinal office said,
*20:41.640- 20:48.760* :  the blessing should not be seen as an endorsement of the life that LGBT people lead them.
*20:48.880- 20:54.140* :  And it urged the bishops, basically, to read it all again, to make a full and calm reading
*20:54.140- 20:58.700* :  as a putty of this page declaration approved by Pope Francis.
*20:58.700- 21:05.500* :  He's trying to make the church more welcoming to LGBT people, but without changing the moral doctrine.
*21:05.840- 21:10.980* :  But it does acknowledge that it could be a difficult issue in certain parts of Africa.
*21:10.980- 21:14.220* :  What does this tell us about the Catholic Church in those areas?
*21:14.220- 21:17.280* :  And it's differences with more liberal congregations.
*21:17.820- 21:22.940* :  I think the Catholic Church finds itself in an unprecedented situation in Africa,
*21:22.940- 21:32.020* :  where as soon as the Pope's comments were issued, the well-known bishops in Africa were coming out and speaking against the leader of their own church.
*21:32.020- 21:38.460* :  If you listen to the words of people like Bishop Timbuka Malawi or Bishop Kasal of Tanzania,
*21:38.460- 21:43.280* :  they were calling what the Pope was suggesting offensive and blasphemous.
*21:43.580- 21:47.000* :  They said they would not be going on with it at all.
*21:47.400- 21:51.980* :  I know there has been some suggestions in the past that if things are liberalized too much,
*21:51.980- 21:57.260* :  church leaders there say they fear losing their congregations to perhaps other religions.
*21:57.260- 22:00.920* :  But what is life like for gay people in Africa?
*22:00.920- 22:04.400* :  And are there signs of more liberal attitudes coming through at all?
*22:04.680- 22:08.300* :  Well, it's only a week ago when President of Burundi, for instance,
*22:08.300- 22:10.820* :  was talking about stoning gay people.
*22:10.860- 22:15.740* :  And of course you've got these harsh Ugandan laws where gay people could be imprisoned.
*22:15.740- 22:18.900* :  And in some cases could even be sentenced to death.
*22:19.240- 22:22.180* :  There are areas where there are signs of change.
*22:22.960- 22:25.940* :  For instance, in the southern African bishops' conference,
*22:26.480- 22:28.780* :  they've kind of going along with what the Pope is saying.
*22:28.780- 22:33.820* :  They sort of like the idea of this blessing, which is only a 15 second affair at the end of the day.
*22:33.820- 22:36.340* :  But blessing in the hope of conversion.
*22:36.940- 22:39.000* :  Our Africa Regional Editor, David Bamford.
*22:39.640- 22:45.220* :  The Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Maloni, has suspended an MP from her right-wing brothers of Italy party
*22:45.600- 22:47.880* :  who took a handgun to a New Year's Eve party.
*22:48.360- 22:55.260* :  Emmanuel A. Potsolo admitted owning the gun but says he didn't fire the shot that resulted in a fellow guest being injured.
*22:55.760- 22:57.760* :  Here's our Rome correspondent, Mark Lohan.
*22:58.160- 23:02.700* :  A New Year's Eve party in Northern Italy went off with a bang, not from fireworks,
*23:02.700- 23:07.800* :  but from the handgun of a guest, Emmanuel A. Potsolo, a governing party MP,
*23:07.800- 23:12.520* :  which fired, likely injuring the son-in-law of a junior minister's bodyguard.
*23:13.220- 23:18.200* :  Mr. Potsolo says the mini revolver, which he legally held, discharged by accident.
*23:18.860- 23:23.280* :  He's been put under investigation by prosecutors and has now been suspended from the party
*23:23.280- 23:27.220* :  by the Prime Minister, Georgia Maloni, who called his behavior irresponsible.
*23:31.200- 23:36.860* :  Someone has behaved irresponsibly and the one who wasn't being responsible is the owner of that gun.
*23:37.260- 23:41.040* :  It is not acceptable and even less so for a member of parliament.
*23:41.720- 23:43.640* :  Let alone a member of my party.
*23:44.420- 23:48.720* :  This is why I have asked for the MP to be referred to our party's ethics commission
*23:49.300- 23:52.100* :  and pending an outcome he is suspended.
*23:52.600- 23:57.020* :  Mr. Potsolo claims that the gun fell and that when the victim, Luca Campana,
*23:57.020- 23:58.480* :  picked it up, it discharged.
*23:59.240- 24:04.280* :  That's denied by Mr. Campana, who says the MP was holding the weapon when the shot went off.
*24:04.900- 24:08.320* :  The affair is likely to ignite debate over gun ownership in Italy.
*24:08.320- 24:14.160* :  It is tightly regulated, but Maloni's party recently proposed reducing the minimum age
*24:14.160- 24:17.860* :  to 16 to obtain a permit to own a hunting rifle.
*24:18.440- 24:20.380* :  Our Rome correspondent, Mark Lohan.
*24:21.380- 24:25.160* :  Despite some initial skepticism about the condition long COVID,
*24:25.760- 24:31.200* :  there has since been a gradual acceptance that it seems to be both very real and quite debilitating.
*24:31.900- 24:35.280* :  Now researchers have found evidence of what is actually going on in the body.
*24:35.280- 24:39.440* :  Dr. Rob Wast is an assistant professor at the Free University of Amsterdam
*24:39.440- 24:41.360* :  and one of the authors of a new study.
*24:41.360- 24:45.380* :  He spoke to Owen Bennett Jones about what he and his colleagues had discovered.
*24:46.020- 24:49.480* :  We were particularly interested in the effects of exercise in patients with long COVID
*24:49.480- 24:51.440* :  and how they respond to exercise.
*24:51.520- 24:54.660* :  We know from patients that they get worse after performing exercise.
*24:54.660- 24:57.000* :  That can last weeks or even months sometimes,
*24:57.200- 25:01.220* :  and we really wanted to understand what is going on in the side of the skeletal muscle with these patients.
*25:01.580- 25:04.900* :  We particularly focus on the changes that happened in the skeletal muscle
*25:05.340- 25:07.300* :  before, first after, about of exercise.
*25:07.620- 25:12.280* :  We found really big changes in the skeletal muscle that can explain why these people feeling fatigued
*25:12.580- 25:14.040* :  and suffer from muscle pain, for instance.
*25:14.300- 25:17.220* :  We discovered that the skeletal muscle when the metabolism is altered
*25:17.640- 25:19.440* :  and worsens acutely upon exercise.
*25:19.480- 25:23.320* :  And also we see signs of extensive muscle damage.
*25:23.960- 25:25.160* :  After exercise in these patients,
*25:25.380- 25:29.220* :  you have cells that are dying and fibres that are dying and are disintegrating.
*25:29.220- 25:34.580* :  But we also see signs of infiltration of immune cells in the skeletal muscle that try to repair the damage
*25:35.240- 25:37.320* :  that generally takes months for the muscle to be repaired.
*25:37.500- 25:40.540* :  One of the things that struck me as interesting about this long COVID is that
*25:40.540- 25:44.660* :  so many people have got it, that it's generating funds for research,
*25:44.660- 25:48.180* :  which was needed years ago in a sense that lots of people have had post viral things,
*25:48.500- 25:50.000* :  haven't they, which have been totally unexplained?
*25:50.500- 25:53.260* :  People have had it for decades, in some cases, and never resolved.
*25:53.260- 25:56.420* :  And you're sort of finding evidence, which could help them.
*25:56.620- 26:00.520* :  That's indeed a COVID pandemic, in that sense, has helped those patients as well,
*26:00.700- 26:04.760* :  in the sense that there is now a search for information and trying to find treatments
*26:04.760- 26:08.940* :  for those patients and acknowledgement that there is really something going on in the skeletal muscle in a body.
*26:09.060- 26:12.800* :  It's interesting you say acknowledgement, because I think that's what a lot of people in this situation want,
*26:12.820- 26:15.420* :  isn't it, to know that they're not just making it up?
*26:15.520- 26:18.180* :  No, indeed, and that's something that has followed them for a long time,
*26:18.180- 26:19.260* :  that there's something psychological.
*26:19.320- 26:22.620* :  Fatigue has been always explained as a psychological reason,
*26:22.940- 26:27.040* :  and that's exactly what we don't find, is that there is really a biological reason for the fatigue
*26:27.040- 26:28.380* :  and not something in between your ears.
*26:28.660- 26:30.860* :  Some people get over post viral illness.
*26:30.860- 26:33.960* :  Have you any idea why some recover some don't?
*26:34.240- 26:39.440* :  No, we don't, but we luckily have also followed up these people that we have now tested a year ago,
*26:39.620- 26:46.000* :  and we take a muscle, not a blood sample, a year after to see whether we can see any signs of improvements in some cases,
*26:46.000- 26:49.000* :  because we do see that some people do get better,
*26:49.320- 26:53.140* :  but we don't know why these people are changing and what really makes them change,
*26:53.280- 26:55.100* :  just too early to say anything about that.
*26:55.540- 26:58.280* :  It's great what you've done, but you're a long way from solving this.
*26:58.360- 26:58.780* :  Yes, I know.
*26:58.780- 27:04.080* :  One of the highlights from this study is that we say don't do intense exercise and don't make it worse,
*27:04.400- 27:07.280* :  because I think if you constantly go over your threshold,
*27:07.280- 27:11.720* :  you eventually go into this facial circle that brings you all the way down to a bedridden patient,
*27:11.740- 27:18.080* :  and taking rest and making sure that the body can recover is at the moment the easiest treatment option that we can give.
*27:18.340- 27:22.940* :  Well, I'm sure many people who have these ailments will be thanking you very much for the work you're doing.
*27:23.100- 27:27.980* :  Yes, we've also received lots of comments on X or Twitter and other social media contacts,
*27:27.980- 27:31.160* :  and yes, patient contact in this case has been super exciting.
*27:31.660- 27:34.060* :  Rob was talking to Owen Bennett Jones.
*27:35.360- 27:40.280* :  San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge has been a much loved landmark since it opened in 1937,
*27:40.760- 27:43.020* :  but it has another darker history too.
*27:43.280- 27:46.100* :  It's thought to be the world's most popular suicide spot.
*27:46.780- 27:52.420* :  Now, a new deterrent has finally been installed to try to change that. Stephanie Prentice explains.
*27:54.200- 27:57.060* :  Spanning the one-mile straight of the Golden Gate,
*27:57.060- 28:01.520* :  the body of water connecting San Francisco to the Pacific Ocean,
*28:01.560- 28:08.780* :  the bridge's tall, orange pillars and sweeping cables have attracted tourists from all over the world since it opened.
*28:09.920- 28:14.080* :  But more than 2,000 people have jumped from the bridge to their deaths,
*28:14.520- 28:17.780* :  landing around 75 metres below in the water.
*28:18.660- 28:24.960* :  Some of those people would have regretted that choice the minute they let go of the railings, say their families,
*28:25.680- 28:30.920* :  and a group of them campaigned for decades for a safety net that would run the length of the bridge.
*28:31.660- 28:34.100* :  Now, their dream has finally come to life.
*28:34.600- 28:36.280* :  Ed Ray's helped to build it.
*28:36.600- 28:38.440* :  They've done studies on suicide prevention,
*28:38.560- 28:42.140* :  and they've come to the realization that if there's a deterrent there, visually,
*28:42.140- 28:44.000* :  they can stop a lot of poop from jumping.
*28:44.460- 28:49.180* :  There've been calls to do something about suicides on the bridge from as early as 1939.
*28:49.500- 28:54.820* :  However, many argued a net or a railing could ruin the aesthetic and the views.
*28:54.820- 28:57.540* :  But the activists didn't give up.
*28:57.820- 29:02.320* :  They say many studies suggest that suicide survivors never try again,
*29:02.960- 29:06.900* :  proving they're regrett and the need to give jumpers a second chance.
*29:06.900- 29:14.160* :  One of the strongest voices was Dana Whitmer, whose son Matthew died after jumping off the bridge in 2007.
*29:14.760- 29:19.040* :  They only get four seconds and they've already changed their minds, but they can't do anything about it.
*29:19.220- 29:22.380* :  But if you try hanging, you can rethink that.
*29:22.840- 29:25.500* :  If you try an overdose, you definitely rethink that.
*29:25.760- 29:29.240* :  So over the decades, suicides by so many methods have decreased,
*29:29.500- 29:32.180* :  and Golden Gate Bridge is the only one that's increased.
*29:32.680- 29:38.540* :  Almost a century, several construction teams and an estimated $400 million later,
*29:39.140- 29:40.780* :  that's now set to change.
*29:41.360- 29:44.700* :  But the net's makers are still advocating for caution.
*29:45.400- 29:49.020* :  The wide metal lattice, positioned six metres below the bridge,
*29:49.360- 29:52.760* :  is being described as like landing in a cheese grater.
*29:53.260- 29:57.340* :  In its only design, they say to prevent death and not injury.
*29:58.300- 29:59.640* :  Stephanie Prentice reporting.
*30:00.560- 30:05.140* :  The British teenager, Luke Littleer, became the youngest ever finalist in the world,
*30:05.140- 30:08.280* :  Darts Championships here in London on Wednesday evening,
*30:08.280- 30:12.780* :  for having to buy some new tracksuits and treat himself to another cabab, if he won.
*30:12.780- 30:17.600* :  The 16-year-old story captivated millions and delivered big TV audiences.
*30:18.340- 30:24.600* :  Sadly, though, his remarkable debut run came to an end when he lost to Luke Humphreys in a gripping final.
*30:24.980- 30:27.860* :  Our sports news correspondent Andy Swiss reports.
*30:28.780- 30:33.780* :  From a virtual unknown to one of sports' most famous 16-year-olds,
*30:34.120- 30:39.720* :  Darts is no stranger to colourful stories, but in Luke Littleer, it's found a game-changer.
*30:40.340- 30:45.120* :  Littleer spent the day talking to the media with the same composure he showed on the okey,
*30:45.580- 30:48.260* :  about receiving a message of support from David Beckham,
*30:48.620- 30:51.040* :  about looking forward to starting driving lessons,
*30:51.040- 30:56.540* :  and about how his grown-up appearance has left some people questioning his age.
*30:57.080- 31:00.700* :  It's been going on for years when I was 14, he's not 14, he's not 15,
*31:01.340- 31:06.340* :  but I've not bothered. I know I'm 16, like I said, it's been going on for years now,
*31:06.340- 31:10.820* :  but I'll just block it out, laugh at them, don't even reply to them, don't give them my airtime.
*31:11.600- 31:14.360* :  If further proof we needed of Littleer's pulling power,
*31:14.740- 31:17.660* :  last night TV viewing figures provided it,
*31:18.040- 31:22.120* :  Sky Sports set a peak audience of 3.7 million watched the final,
*31:22.120- 31:25.600* :  a record for the broadcaster for a non-football event.
*31:25.600- 31:29.400* :  The chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation, Matt Porter,
*31:29.920- 31:32.960* :  said Littleer's emergence could be a watershed moment.
*31:33.700- 31:35.460* :  Not just from what he's achieved for himself,
*31:35.520- 31:39.120* :  but what he's achieved for the sport, opening doors for a new demographic.
*31:39.120- 31:43.480* :  There's hundreds and hundreds of kids out there playing organised arts at an academy level
*31:44.100- 31:45.200* :  from the age of 8 upwards,
*31:45.780- 31:47.960* :  so I'm not saying there's plenty more Luke Littleer's out there,
*31:47.960- 31:49.740* :  but there's a lot of talent out there,
*31:49.780- 31:52.780* :  and now maybe he can inspire a generation of future champions.
*31:53.460- 31:55.220* :  And while he might have missed out this year,
*31:55.220- 31:58.460* :  remember the youngest Darts World Champion, Michael van Gerwen,
*31:58.460- 32:02.380* :  was a comparative veteran at the grand old age of 24.
*32:03.300- 32:06.980* :  Littleer still has plenty more shots at sporting history.
*32:07.680- 32:08.320* :  Andy Swiss.
*32:08.500- 32:12.480* :  And that is all from us for now,
*32:12.480- 32:15.240* :  but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:15.240- 32:18.380* :  This edition was mixed by Nick Randall and produced by Emma Joseph,
*32:18.760- 32:19.900* :  our editor's Karen Martin.
*32:20.100- 32:22.200* :  I'm Oliver Conway, until next time, goodbye.
*32:24.500- 32:25.760* :  .
