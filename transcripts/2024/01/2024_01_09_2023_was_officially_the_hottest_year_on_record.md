*01:43.560- 01:46.120* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:48.400- 01:53.420* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 9th of January these are our main stories.
*01:54.020- 02:00.140* :  2023 has been confirmed as the hottest year on record as temperatures rose exceptionally across
*02:00.140- 02:05.760* :  the globe. Reports of intense bombing in southern Gaza as the US Secretary of State
*02:05.760- 02:12.000* :  meets the Israeli President in Tel Aviv and a mixed response to South Korea's governments banning
*02:12.000- 02:19.880* :  the killing and selling of dogs for food. Also in this podcast I had exchanged messages with
*02:19.880- 02:24.360* :  my fictional mom. I looked at photos of families. I watched a bit of tally.
*02:25.480- 02:30.340* :  They changed the world but the iPhone will Apple do it again with VR headsets.
*02:32.920- 02:37.760* :  We've become used to hearing about world breaking temperature records but here's a hugely
*02:37.760- 02:45.120* :  significant one. 2023 was the hottest year on record. Data from the European Climate Monitoring
*02:45.120- 02:53.460* :  Organization Copernicus indicates it's surpassed 2016 by 0.17 degrees Celsius or to pick through
*02:53.460- 02:56.640* :  this for us. I spoke to our environment correspondent Matt McGraw.
*02:57.340- 03:01.540* :  Yeah, and if you might be forgiven for thinking that breaking the previous hottest year record by
*03:01.540- 03:08.000* :  0.17 degrees Celsius wasn't a great deal but you have to put this in context. It's not just
*03:08.000- 03:13.680* :  the hottest year perhaps since records began in 1850 but likely according to many scientists
*03:13.680- 03:20.340* :  the warmest year in 100,000 years and in that year we've just had you have to look at the data
*03:20.340- 03:26.000* :  from the middle of the year onwards from June, July every month on from June essentially was
*03:26.000- 03:31.980* :  hotter than any of the similar months in any previous year. We had more days last year. In fact
*03:31.980- 03:38.500* :  every day last year was over one degree warmer than the long-term records from 1850 to 1900 so
*03:38.860- 03:42.900* :  it's very significant. We've known it's been coming. It's been predicted because the months have
*03:42.900- 03:47.160* :  been so warm that it would break these records and now we have the final confirmation if you like
*03:47.160- 03:53.760* :  of just how hot it was. And Matt another very significant moment because with an average 1.48
*03:53.760- 04:00.040* :  degrees above pre-industrial levels it gets very very close to that 1.5 degree threshold,
*04:00.040- 04:03.600* :  doesn't it? Tell us, remind us if you would why that is so significant.
*04:04.940- 04:09.860* :  Yeah, the 1.5 degree threshold has become I suppose the real barrier for rising temperatures
*04:09.860- 04:13.960* :  across the world in the last number of years because scientists recognize that going beyond that
*04:13.960- 04:18.860* :  number is essentially going into very uncharted territories and the impacts get much higher
*04:18.860- 04:24.620* :  beyond 1.5. This was recognized by politicians in the Paris Agreement in 2015 where they said they
*04:24.620- 04:29.060* :  would do their best efforts to keep temperatures under two and even under 1.5. It's particularly
*04:29.060- 04:34.980* :  important to small island states and developing countries who see that 1.5 as the gateway to survival
*04:34.980- 04:39.320* :  going beyond that would see sea levels rise to such an extent that many countries might cease to
*04:39.320- 04:44.980* :  exist. So seeing the temperatures last year go very close to this 1.5 degree threshold is a worry.
*04:44.980- 04:48.940* :  Now it's a dire precedent scientists are calling it. It doesn't mean the threshold has been
*04:48.940- 04:54.300* :  broken. That would need temperatures to be above 1.5 for 20 to 30 years. We're not at that yet,
*04:54.300- 04:59.520* :  but the pointers, the indicators are going in the wrong direction. Matt El Nino, which are the
*04:59.520- 05:04.620* :  warm ocean currents that are around at the moment, are pushing temperatures up. Are there any
*05:04.620- 05:10.500* :  predictions about what the temperature will be next year? Yeah, absolutely. El Nino is a very
*05:10.500- 05:15.660* :  important factor in making 2023 the warmest year on record, but it also could, in fact, push 2024
*05:15.660- 05:21.420* :  to the warmest year on record title as well, because that El Nino is ongoing and gathering strength
*05:21.420- 05:25.820* :  and will probably peak in the next couple of months. That pushes a lot more heat from the oceans
*05:25.820- 05:31.400* :  up into the atmosphere where it's warming this planet on an ongoing basis. Now the view is that
*05:31.400- 05:37.660* :  this may well be the warmest year 2024, and the hope would be that in the years going beyond that,
*05:37.660- 05:41.880* :  it would actually decline a little bit, but El Nino is certainly playing a big role, a second
*05:41.880- 05:46.640* :  to the role of burning fossil fuels around the planet. Matt McGraw there. And later we'll head to
*05:46.640- 05:50.860* :  Mozambique to see how the country is continuing to battle the effects of climate change
*05:51.360- 05:55.940* :  after a devastating cyclone hit its shores five years ago. That's coming up.
*05:57.280- 06:01.840* :  To Israel now, and five days of diplomacy around the Middle East, it's culminating today in
*06:01.840- 06:07.160* :  Israel for the US Secretary of State. Anthony Blinken is in Tel Aviv where he's been holding talks
*06:07.160- 06:13.540* :  with the Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Mr. Blinken is expected to repeat calls for Israel to do more
*06:13.540- 06:18.820* :  to reduce civilian deaths in Gaza. He's due to meet the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:18.820- 06:24.940* :  later. He told reporters that there was a lot to discuss. I've just come from a number of countries
*06:25.520- 06:32.160* :  in the region, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar. Now that I remember Saudi Arabia and I want to be
*06:32.160- 06:36.880* :  able to share a solid what I grew from those leaders with the President, as well as with the Prime
*06:36.880- 06:41.220* :  Minister and the Cabinet later today. And of course, we'll have an opportunity to sit with the
*06:41.780- 06:48.160* :  families of some of the hostages and discuss our relentless efforts to bring everyone home
*06:48.720- 06:54.220* :  and back with their families. And there's lots to talk about the particular about the way forward.
*06:54.860- 07:00.560* :  Well, Mr. Blinken's meetings coincide with reports of intense bombing overnight in Hanyunis and
*07:00.560- 07:06.580* :  Raffa in southern Gaza. The Hamas-Ran Health Ministry says 57 people were killed in one
*07:06.580- 07:12.120* :  central Gaza hospital alone. Whilst the Israeli military has confirmed nine of its soldiers have
*07:12.120- 07:16.440* :  died in fighting. The BBC's Middle East correspondent Yolandao is in Jerusalem.
*07:17.700- 07:21.720* :  There's so much really for Mr. Blinken to talk about in this day of back-to-back meetings.
*07:21.720- 07:27.300* :  First of all, it's how the war in Gaza is being fought with a lot of concern about the very
*07:27.300- 07:32.320* :  high numbers of civilian casualties that are being seen, the fact that people are being newly
*07:32.320- 07:37.780* :  displaced. Israel's military is now saying that it's going to lower the intensity of fighting
*07:37.780- 07:43.580* :  in the coming weeks. Otherwise, he wants to talk about getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza
*07:43.960- 07:49.960* :  urgently and getting Israeli hostages, the dozens of them that remain in Hamas captivity out.
*07:50.000- 07:54.500* :  And he is going to be meeting the families of Israeli hostages in the course of the day.
*07:54.860- 08:00.500* :  Otherwise, it's about the regional spillover of the war. And Israel is having very high
*08:00.500- 08:05.280* :  tensions at the moment on its northern border with Lebanon, where there's been almost daily fighting
*08:05.280- 08:10.500* :  with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. A lot of regional concern about that. And Mr. Blinken
*08:10.500- 08:15.260* :  is also bringing another message from his meetings with Arab leaders about the need to talk about
*08:15.260- 08:21.880* :  the way forward for Gaza. That's both in terms of its post-war governance, but also longer term.
*08:22.060- 08:26.780* :  He's saying that Arab states are holding out the possibility of more integration with Israel,
*08:26.780- 08:32.920* :  but only if he's saying there is a practical pathway to creating an independent Palestinian state
*08:32.920- 08:38.720* :  down the road. Yolan Nelv. We're going to go to the West Bank now and a center for disabled
*08:38.720- 08:44.760* :  children in the Nurshams refugee camp says essential items, including documents, food,
*08:44.760- 08:50.800* :  includes were destroyed after an Israeli raid last week. The center is funded by the UK charity
*08:50.800- 08:57.260* :  ABCD, action around Bethlehem children with disability. Reverend Daniel Burton is a
*08:57.260- 09:02.220* :  vicar in Oldham in the north of England, and he's chair of the trustees. He spoke to the BBC's
*09:02.220- 09:07.520* :  Michelle Hussein. As part of a larger raid on Nurshams refugee camp, the center was
*09:07.880- 09:13.680* :  raided. Every room in the building was somehow vandalized. Peppers about the care of the children
*09:14.200- 09:19.340* :  were destroyed, food and winter clothing for the children disappeared, and essential equipment
*09:19.340- 09:23.280* :  for the building was thrown outside on the street. This was at night when the building was locked,
*09:23.320- 09:28.300* :  and there was nobody in the building at all. Is there any possibility that this building was being
*09:28.300- 09:35.660* :  used by Hamas or Hamas suspects? Almost impossible. It is in a strategic location,
*09:35.660- 09:39.560* :  near the entrance to the camp. I've been there myself a couple of times in the past few years,
*09:40.280- 09:44.220* :  but the building was empty. There's no evidence that it was being used for any other purpose,
*09:45.220- 09:48.260* :  and it's hard to see the actions as anything other than want and violence really.
*09:48.520- 09:54.640* :  Who uses the building? We care for about 250 children who have complex physical and
*09:54.640- 09:59.500* :  learning disabilities over the course of an average month. It's a remarkable centre that
*09:59.520- 10:04.960* :  BBC de Bethlehem has seen build up from one room to three floors over the last eight years.
*10:05.420- 10:10.360* :  It's become a comprehensive centre for rehabilitation, and these families consequently are now
*10:10.360- 10:15.940* :  unable to access life-changing therapy. Was the Reverend Daniel Burton there? And in response,
*10:15.940- 10:22.400* :  the Israeli Defence Forces told the BBC, the IDF conducts nightly counter-terrorism operations
*10:22.400- 10:28.000* :  to apprehend suspects. Many of them are part of the Hamas terrorist organisation. In addition,
*10:28.000- 10:33.300* :  as part of the security operations in the area, dynamic checkpoints have been put up over different
*10:33.300- 10:40.440* :  places. For centuries, dog meat has been on the menu in South Korea. But from today,
*10:40.440- 10:45.100* :  the killing and selling of dogs for food has been banned by the country's parliament,
*10:45.100- 10:51.800* :  where the bill was passed by 208 votes to zero. Animal rights activists who put pressure on
*10:51.800- 10:56.860* :  the government to outlaw the practice, call the ban, history in the making. Boramis Yol is from
*10:56.860- 11:02.380* :  the Animal Charity Humane Society International. I still have goosebumps all over my body now.
*11:02.380- 11:08.200* :  I never believed it was a part of Korean culture ever. Already, it was time to end this cruel,
*11:08.200- 11:14.820* :  brutal industry in South Korea. So, this is a very, very meaningful step forward for
*11:14.820- 11:20.080* :  and more often over in Korea. But the ban hasn't been welcome news for everyone.
*11:21.020- 11:26.540* :  From Seoul, our correspondent Jean McKenzie has more details. Dog meat is considered a delicacy
*11:26.540- 11:32.000* :  among some older Koreans. But it's far less popular now with young people. Many of them
*11:32.000- 11:37.600* :  never eat it now or have never even tried it. And so consumption is falling. And when we spoke to
*11:37.600- 11:46.480* :  people about the ban, the generational divide was stark. We've eaten this since the middle ages.
*11:46.780- 11:50.980* :  Why stop us from eating our traditional food? If you ban dog, you should ban beef.
*11:54.900- 12:00.300* :  More people have pets today. Dogs are like family now and it's not nice to eat our family.
*12:00.300- 12:06.740* :  So I think it's best to get rid of it. Under the new law, those who farm butcher or sell dogs to eat
*12:06.740- 12:11.400* :  can be jailed for up to three years. Though it won't actually be illegal to eat dog meat.
*12:11.400- 12:15.340* :  It's hoped that the ban on selling will be enough to stop people from eating it.
*12:15.620- 12:20.040* :  The ban won't come into force for another three years to give restaurant owners and farmers
*12:20.500- 12:25.200* :  time to find another job or to transition their businesses. And the government has promised to
*12:25.200- 12:30.620* :  support those who are forced to switch livelihoods. But the industry has been incredibly critical of
*12:30.620- 12:36.720* :  this ban. They've argued that given the declining popularity of dog meat,
*12:37.080- 12:40.480* :  the government should have just allowed it to disappear naturally over time.
*12:45.340- 12:50.180* :  What are we supposed to do now? We need to be compensated. I think we should accept dog
*12:50.280- 12:57.380* :  meat, but raise and slaughter them in a hygienic environment. In contrast, animal rights organizations
*12:57.380- 13:01.860* :  have of course welcomed this ban. They have been campaigning for this for a long time,
*13:01.860- 13:07.440* :  arguing that the practice is cruel and the conditions on the farms where the dogs are kept are poor.
*13:08.100- 13:12.940* :  Previous governments here in South Korea have tried to ban this as far back as the 1980s.
*13:13.280- 13:18.660* :  But the current president and the first lady are known to be animal lovers. They have six dogs
*13:18.660- 13:23.820* :  of their own. And this is thought to be one of the reasons the bill has now passed.
*13:24.060- 13:29.720* :  Jean McKenzie. In our earlier edition, we brought you the news that the French Prime Minister,
*13:29.720- 13:34.220* :  Elizabeth Bonn, had resigned as president in Emmanuel Macron,
*13:34.220- 13:37.680* :  tries to boost his political fortunes ahead of European elections.
*13:38.280- 13:42.740* :  Now an update in the country has a new Prime Minister, the youngest in modern French history.
*13:43.080- 13:48.700* :  At just 34 years old, Gabrielle Attal also becomes the first openly gay French Prime Minister.
*13:48.700- 13:53.980* :  Hugh Scofield has more. Gabrielle Attal is a young Macron loyalist who's made a rapid
*13:53.980- 13:58.440* :  ascent after being elected to Parliament in the wake of the president's first election victory in
*13:58.440- 14:04.340* :  2017. He became a familiar face when he was made government spokesman in 2020, and recently he
*14:04.340- 14:09.560* :  served as education minister, winning plaudits from the president for his decisive handling of a
*14:09.560- 14:16.480* :  row over the Muslim robe, the Abaya, Attal banned them in schools. He has energy, charm and fluency,
*14:16.480- 14:21.480* :  qualities which you'll need in large amounts given the challenges that face him. These are the
*14:21.480- 14:26.660* :  same problems that cause such difficulty to his predecessor, the outgoing Elizabeth Bonn,
*14:26.860- 14:31.700* :  a Parliament with no inbuilt government majority so that every new law is a struggle,
*14:32.320- 14:37.780* :  and a surging hard right under Marine Le Pen and her also youthful and increasingly
*14:37.780- 14:41.600* :  prominent Lieutenant Jordan Bardella. Hugh Scofield.
*14:44.940- 14:50.660* :  I think he's the first time that Taiwan has issued an alert for the launch of a Chinese
*14:50.660- 14:56.820* :  satellite, so that in itself is unusual. Yeah, Taiwan issues that island-wide alert after a
*14:56.820- 15:01.980* :  Chinese satellite enters its airspace days before a crucial presidential election.
*15:06.540- 15:09.620* :  Some people play golf on the weekends. I hunt con artists.

*17:01.480- 17:05.420* :  There's some of the findings from airlines over the last couple of days since inspections
*17:05.420- 17:10.520* :  began after a section of the fuselage fell from Alaska Airlines plane last week.
*17:10.540- 17:17.340* :  The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, has grounded 171 planes, Turkish airlines,
*17:17.340- 17:23.380* :  Panama's copper airlines in Errol, Mexico, have all grounded the MAX-9s for inspection.
*17:23.760- 17:26.540* :  Our international business correspondent Theo Legert has more.
*17:27.320- 17:32.080* :  They are worrying findings because they show that the problems were not confined to a single
*17:32.080- 17:36.620* :  aircraft. Now just to recap on what actually happened to this plane, minutes after takeoff,
*17:36.920- 17:40.960* :  an unused door in the fuselage, which would have been concealed behind the interior trim,
*17:41.480- 17:45.820* :  blew out and the aircraft depressurized very, very rapidly. There was a rush of air out of the
*17:45.820- 17:51.180* :  aircraft. The pilots' headsets were ripped off. It was all very dramatic. But it happened when
*17:51.180- 17:55.380* :  the aircraft was still fairly low, when people were still strapped into their seats.
*17:55.660- 18:00.720* :  If that same incident had happened at cruising altitude at about 38,000 feet, it would have been
*18:00.720- 18:05.460* :  a lot more severe. So that's why everybody is treating this with such caution and looking very
*18:05.460- 18:10.520* :  carefully what's going on. Now it was pretty obvious immediately after the accident that
*18:10.620- 18:15.700* :  something had gone wrong with that of an individual plane and that it was likely to be some kind of
*18:15.700- 18:20.900* :  production or assembly problem because the door in question has been used on other aircraft for
*18:20.900- 18:25.180* :  many years. There's nothing new about that. There haven't been any particular problems and this
*18:25.180- 18:30.440* :  was a brand new aircraft. Two months old had badly done 200 flights. But what we're saying now is
*18:30.440- 18:34.860* :  that with the fleet grounded, all the equivalent design of plane, the equivalent configuration,
*18:34.860- 18:40.640* :  they're being looked at. And both United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose hardware,
*18:40.640- 18:47.020* :  loose balls. That is very strongly suggestive of a quality control problem on the production line.
*18:47.260- 18:52.740* :  So the question then becomes how far does this stretch? And what other problems might the be?
*18:52.740- 19:00.940* :  Is this indicative of a wider problem? Theo ligate. Mobile phones across Taiwan received an
*19:00.940- 19:07.240* :  air raid alert on Tuesday after a Chinese rocket carrying a satellite flew over the island's southern
*19:07.240- 19:12.320* :  airspace. The authorities in Taiwan have been on high alert as they gear up for presidential
*19:12.320- 19:18.480* :  elections due on Saturday. One of the candidates, William Lai, has accused Beijing of unprecedented
*19:18.480- 19:23.440* :  interference in an attempt to influence the outcome of the poll. He said although China
*19:23.440- 19:28.120* :  meddles every time Taiwan holds elections, this time it was the most serious ever witnessed.
*19:28.820- 19:32.540* :  Earlier, our Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Bristo, told me more about the alert.
*19:33.180- 19:38.020* :  Well, the alert came at about 3pm in the afternoon in Taiwan. It was issued to mobile phones
*19:38.020- 19:43.480* :  to Taiwanese residents. Essentially what it said was that, well, in Chinese, it said that China
*19:43.480- 19:50.060* :  had launched a satellite, but in English, which is caused some confusion, it said that there was
*19:50.060- 19:54.820* :  an air raid alert and a missile was flying over. So that's what it said in English. The ministry
*19:54.820- 19:59.460* :  of defense afterwards apologized for that saying it would be in a mis-translation, but the
*19:59.460- 20:05.900* :  alert in itself, I think, is the first time that Taiwan has issued an alert for the launch of a
*20:05.900- 20:11.860* :  Chinese satellite. So that in itself is unusual. Of course, makes people quite worried. And as you
*20:11.860- 20:17.700* :  mentioned there, it comes just days before a presidential election in Taiwan. Now, that's
*20:17.700- 20:23.700* :  important context because China believes Taiwan is part of its own territory. Taiwan accuses
*20:23.700- 20:28.060* :  China of interfering in the elections. So, of course, some people are going to see the timing
*20:28.060- 20:32.780* :  of this satellite launch. The Taiwanese authorities said they weren't warned about it in advance.
*20:32.780- 20:39.480* :  There's some kind of a warning or potential threat to Taiwan that China has some kind of rocket
*20:39.480- 20:45.780* :  capabilities. Okay. What's being said on the campaign trail, though, because this is being
*20:45.780- 20:50.260* :  seen as a seminar election, isn't it? Yeah, interestingly, just a few hours before this,
*20:50.260- 20:55.780* :  to emphasize what went on afterwards, William Lai, one of the leading candidates, or perhaps the
*20:55.780- 21:01.980* :  leading candidate to take over the presidency in Taiwan later this year, had warned of Chinese
*21:01.980- 21:07.380* :  interference in the election. And it's certain China has been doing that. Of recent weeks,
*21:07.380- 21:12.920* :  it's criticized particularly William Lai for his independence-leaning statements. Remember,
*21:13.400- 21:17.920* :  China thinks that Taiwan's part of its own territory doesn't want Taiwan to declare independence.
*21:18.800- 21:23.620* :  It has been interfering in that way. It has been sending planes, China has been sending planes
*21:23.620- 21:32.180* :  to Taiwan as well. So, this satellite launch, it's hard not to see it as some kind of involvement
*21:32.180- 21:35.760* :  in the election campaigning going on in Taiwan at the moment.
*21:36.820- 21:43.180* :  Mickey Bristo. The Balkans region in Europe was driven by ethnic tensions and war after the collapse
*21:43.180- 21:48.820* :  of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. One of the countries to emerge from the chaos was Bosnia
*21:48.820- 21:55.040* :  Herzegovina, where peace accords created a state, where Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs shared
*21:55.040- 22:01.400* :  power. Tensions have been rising again there. Its majority-surb region is marking a holiday that's
*22:01.400- 22:07.160* :  been declared unconstitutional by the country's highest court. The president of the majority-surb area,
*22:07.160- 22:14.660* :  Meloradoric, said they have a right to mark the day. We're integrating. We're mentally
*22:14.660- 22:20.660* :  integrated into Serbia. Of course, we're part of Bosnia now, but that's because we have to be.
*22:21.260- 22:26.580* :  Bosnia Herzegovina is not something we want. We don't wish any harm to the Bosnians and
*22:26.580- 22:31.500* :  Croats in Bosnia, but I've never felt, for example, that Sarajevo is my city.
*22:33.240- 22:35.280* :  Our Balkans correspondent, Guida Lordy, has more.
*22:36.060- 22:41.200* :  In 1992, secessionists declared a breakaway Serb Republic on the 9th of January.
*22:41.780- 22:46.740* :  Non-Serbs view that as the start of a campaign of forced displacement, illegal detainment,
*22:46.740- 22:52.080* :  and murder. Relatives of victims of the Srebrenica massacre want the day to be declared a
*22:52.080- 22:57.440* :  day of mourning, rather than celebration. This year's events will include a parade, a concert,
*22:57.880- 23:02.400* :  and co-alternated fireworks displays in Republic of Serbska's main city, Banya Luka,
*23:02.400- 23:07.820* :  and Serbia's capital, Belgrade. They're likely to exacerbate the ongoing power struggle
*23:07.820- 23:12.720* :  between Republic of Serbska's president, Meloradoric, and the International High Representative,
*23:13.360- 23:18.280* :  Christian Schmidt. Kajgalore. It's been almost five years since Cyclone
*23:18.280- 23:23.060* :  and I die, crashed into Mozambique's coastline. One and a half thousand people were killed,
*23:23.060- 23:28.140* :  three million people were affected across three countries. Although the storm has long passed,
*23:28.140- 23:32.740* :  the danger hasn't, as climate change is predicted to make such extreme weather conditions
*23:32.740- 23:37.940* :  even stronger. After reporting on the rescue effort after Cyclone a day, our correspondent
*23:37.940- 23:42.960* :  Nomsa Maseko has returned to the city of Bera to meet the people trying to help their communities
*23:42.960- 23:52.560* :  adapt. At a college in Mozambique's second largest city, Bera, a group of building
*23:52.560- 23:57.740* :  apprentices dressed in blue overalls are gathered around a small demonstration house.
*23:58.320- 24:03.380* :  They're learning how to construct a roof that's been specifically designed to withstand the
*24:03.380- 24:09.980* :  extreme winds and torrential rains that come with a Cyclone. They're learning this because
*24:09.980- 24:15.800* :  scientists expect cyclones and tropical storms to get stronger as a result of global warming,
*24:15.800- 24:21.560* :  with higher wind speeds and more rainfall. Jose Joaquim is a former student at the
*24:21.560- 24:28.940* :  Young Africa Training College who's been helping with today's lesson. Because of the risk of
*24:28.940- 24:35.080* :  the roof being blown away, we use this method fixed just to reinforce it. Also, we reduce the
*24:35.080- 24:40.680* :  distance between the wooden beams, the smaller the distance, the greater the safety. So with
*24:40.680- 24:46.400* :  these resilient techniques, we think it can resist at least the force of winds that we saw during
*24:46.400- 24:55.260* :  Cyclone Idai. A stronger house can provide better shelter during a storm, but there are some
*24:55.260- 25:00.720* :  areas around the coastal city of Bera which are so vulnerable that people need to evacuate
*25:00.720- 25:06.960* :  when there's a strong cyclone predicted. So the local council has set up a series of local
*25:06.960- 25:13.600* :  disaster management committees. These are volunteers who tirelessly work year-round to prepare
*25:13.600- 25:18.420* :  the communities for emergencies and help them evacuate safely when they arrive.
*25:19.540- 25:24.440* :  It's overcast today. There was a pretty intense thunderstorm overnight and
*25:24.440- 25:30.340* :  you can tell that this is an area that gets easily flooded. We are here to meet Luria
*25:30.340- 25:33.940* :  who lives in this area. She's also one of the volunteers.
*25:37.740- 25:42.480* :  So we work together whenever there's an emergency. Like when Cyclones appear suddenly,
*25:42.480- 25:50.120* :  we are right there in the community working with them. Then at other times we do the work of raising
*25:50.160- 25:56.700* :  awareness and I think the effects of these risks are reduced a little because people listen to what
*25:56.700- 26:06.420* :  we have to say. Another way of providing protection to vulnerable coastal areas is replanting
*26:06.420- 26:11.460* :  mangrove forests which have been cut down over the years for building materials and firewood.
*26:12.260- 26:18.100* :  But for volunteers trying their best to help their communities, part of the solution lies far
*26:18.100- 26:24.260* :  away from Mozambique in shores because it isn't lost on them. The fact that Mozambique has caused
*26:24.260- 26:28.460* :  a tiny amount of the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change.
*26:32.060- 26:36.340* :  People in Beira are really unhappy with this situation caused by other countries.
*26:37.120- 26:42.780* :  Here in Mozambique we are already in trouble and those countries are still doing these negative
*26:42.780- 26:48.500* :  things. They shouldn't be making all this gas in other countries. They should let us live like we
*26:48.700- 26:59.760* :  did here in Mozambique. In the meantime, people in Beira will continue to do what they can to adapt
*26:59.760- 27:07.160* :  to climate change in the face of an uncertain future. And you can listen to Nomsomosek's
*27:07.160- 27:14.340* :  documentary today by downloading the documentary podcast. With large clunky headsets and an
*27:14.340- 27:20.640* :  expensive price tag, sales of virtual reality sets slumped last year. It's got some people asking
*27:20.640- 27:28.040* :  is the virtual reality dream dead? No, says Apple. When you put on Apple Vision Pro, you see your world
*27:28.040- 27:33.500* :  and everything in it. Your favorite apps live right in front of you. While the tech giants
*27:33.500- 27:38.960* :  entering the market with their highly anticipated Vision Pro headset, they change the world with the
*27:38.960- 27:44.540* :  iPhone. Can they do it again with virtual reality? Our technology editor Zoe Kleiman has tried
*27:44.540- 27:50.640* :  the Apple product out. What's really interesting about the Apple Vision Pro, I think, is that it's
*27:50.640- 27:58.080* :  got that Apple magic to it. So I tried it out in California last year and I sort of went over
*27:58.080- 28:03.040* :  that thinking, you know, what is Apple doing? Why is it doing this now? It's a really strange step
*28:03.040- 28:08.440* :  for it to take. You know, the VR market has been going for years. It's quite late to the game if you
*28:08.440- 28:13.760* :  like. When I tried it out, it was very tightly curated by Apple, I have to say, you know, it was,
*28:13.760- 28:18.180* :  it was, I was totally in their hands. But when I tried it out, I sort of realized what I think
*28:18.180- 28:24.380* :  they're doing, which is they're looking for a successor to the iPhone. So everything I did on
*28:24.380- 28:28.520* :  that headset was the kind of thing I do on my phone all the time. You know, I had exchanged
*28:28.520- 28:34.140* :  messages with my fictional mom. I looked at photos of families. I watched a bit of Telly. There
*28:34.140- 28:38.760* :  wasn't a lot of kind of, you know, let's go and walk with dinosaurs. Let's go and fight aliens
*28:38.760- 28:44.940* :  and sort of big landmark immersive gaming experiences that you're often sold with virtual reality.
*28:44.940- 28:50.380* :  It was much more mundane than that. But of course, it being Apple, it was very, very slick. So
*28:50.700- 28:55.540* :  the headset works with gesture control. So you just look at an app and you pinch your thumb and
*28:55.540- 28:59.680* :  your index finger together and the app opens. Now you can imagine that being a very frustrating
*28:59.680- 29:04.720* :  experience if it doesn't work. But I have to say that in the 15, 20 minutes or so that I was doing
*29:04.720- 29:08.920* :  it, it worked every single time. And I think people will appreciate that. And I think it will
*29:08.920- 29:15.520* :  bring a market of people who perhaps are less patient with tech overall, but who trusts the
*29:15.520- 29:20.680* :  brand of Apple. Of course, there's always a lot of hype surrounding these things. Famously,
*29:20.680- 29:25.440* :  Mark Zuckerberg talked about the metaverse and how perhaps we were all going to be in this virtual
*29:25.440- 29:33.560* :  reality world banner that clearly hasn't happened. Is there a big hump to get over in terms of
*29:33.560- 29:38.640* :  virtual reality? Is it price? Is it availability? Well, what is it? Why hasn't it taken off?
*29:38.760- 29:43.520* :  It has taken off to an extent that there's a sort of lively market for it, if you like. But it's never
*29:43.520- 29:48.180* :  hit the mainstream. Has it? It's not got to this day where we're all doing it all day long, which is
*29:48.440- 29:54.560* :  the dream of people like Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of meta. I think there are a few obstacles
*29:54.560- 29:59.460* :  in the way. I mean, number one is the headset, even the Apple one, which is more like a pair of
*29:59.460- 30:03.800* :  ski goggles, I guess, in the traditional headset. It's still clunky. Do you want to have that on
*30:03.800- 30:07.900* :  your head for four hours? Do you want to put on a headset in order to send a text message?
*30:08.220- 30:13.380* :  And I think Apple's plan is to reduce that. Ultimately, I would imagine that these things are all
*30:13.380- 30:18.600* :  going to become more like a pair of glasses and less like a big clunky thing that you have to wear
*30:18.600- 30:22.520* :  on your head. The battery life has been an issue because, of course, they use a lot of power.
*30:22.860- 30:28.080* :  Now, Apple has decided to do that by detaching the battery, so you can sit the battery next to
*30:28.080- 30:31.800* :  you and charge it while you're actually using it. You've got to bear in mind as well. Things have
*30:31.800- 30:37.100* :  changed, you know, in 2014, when Meta bought a VR phone called Oculus, there wasn't the great
*30:37.100- 30:41.260* :  broadband that there is now. There wasn't really the infrastructure to support it, and that is all
*30:41.260- 30:46.400* :  changing. So I think it's possible that it will have its moment, but you do have to ask, it's been
*30:46.400- 30:50.060* :  nearly 10 years and it hasn't happened yet, does it? Zoe Kleinman.
