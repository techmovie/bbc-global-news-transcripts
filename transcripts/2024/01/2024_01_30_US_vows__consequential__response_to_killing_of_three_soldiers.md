*00:00.000- 00:03.360* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.960- 00:07.120* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*00:07.120- 00:09.220* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday,
*00:09.220- 00:10.540* :  the 30th of January.
*00:10.780- 00:13.420* :  The US warns it will deliver a powerful response
*00:13.420- 00:15.240* :  to the killing of three American soldiers
*00:15.240- 00:17.780* :  by suspected Iranian-backed militants.
*00:18.020- 00:20.800* :  We will respond decisively to any aggression,
*00:21.160- 00:23.800* :  and we will hold responsible the people who attacked our troops.
*00:23.860- 00:27.660* :  We'll do so at a time and a place of our choosing.
*00:28.140- 00:31.900* :  However, Washington has stressed it does not want a war with Iran.
*00:32.800- 00:35.000* :  French farmers bring their tractors to Paris
*00:35.000- 00:36.720* :  to protest against falling incomes,
*00:37.280- 00:40.740* :  and why you can't search for Taylor Swift on X or Twitter.
*00:43.500- 00:44.420* :  Also in the podcast,
*00:44.520- 00:47.260* :  the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Courts
*00:47.260- 00:49.680* :  has both sides in Sudan's civil war
*00:49.760- 00:52.800* :  appear to be committing war crimes in the Darfur region.
*00:53.500- 00:54.160* :  And...
*00:54.200- 00:56.680* :  This shark was actually completely white in color.
*00:56.880- 00:58.300* :  I was looking at the video, I'm like, the fins.
*00:58.300- 00:59.760* :  They're differently shaped it.
*00:59.760- 01:01.360* :  I'm like, that's not an older white shark.
*01:01.380- 01:02.640* :  That's a very young white shark.
*01:02.640- 01:04.300* :  And I'm like, oh, my goodness, this could be a newborn.
*01:05.080- 01:08.120* :  Was this the youngest, great, white, ever filmed?
*01:13.600- 01:16.740* :  A day after he announced the deaths of three American soldiers
*01:16.740- 01:19.620* :  in the Middle East, the US president Joe Biden
*01:19.620- 01:22.660* :  is under pressure to act against the Iranian-backed militants
*01:22.660- 01:24.220* :  that he blamed for the drone strike.
*01:24.800- 01:27.280* :  At least two senior Republicans called for the US
*01:27.280- 01:30.520* :  to hit Iran directly, though others cautioned
*01:30.520- 01:33.040* :  that that could lead to a dangerous escalation.
*01:33.680- 01:36.580* :  On Monday, the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*01:36.580- 01:38.660* :  said there would be a significant response.
*01:39.040- 01:40.600* :  We've taken steps to defend ourselves
*01:41.600- 01:42.640* :  and to defend our partners,
*01:43.760- 01:45.140* :  as well as to prevent escalation.
*01:45.700- 01:47.000* :  And the president's been crystal clear.
*01:47.820- 01:50.980* :  We will respond decisively to any aggression.
*01:51.760- 01:53.460* :  And we will hold responsible the people
*01:53.460- 01:54.420* :  who attacked our troops.
*01:55.140- 01:58.460* :  We'll do so at a time and a place of our choosing.
*01:59.060- 02:02.480* :  Anthony Blinken, Iran has denied direct involvement
*02:02.480- 02:05.220* :  in the attack, which an Iranian-backed group
*02:05.220- 02:09.160* :  called Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it carried out.
*02:09.880- 02:12.080* :  With more details on the group and exactly what happened
*02:12.080- 02:14.380* :  in the attack near the Jordan-Siria border,
*02:14.380- 02:17.160* :  here's our Middle East correspondent Quentin Somerville.
*02:17.580- 02:19.600* :  The drone struck in the early hours
*02:19.740- 02:21.700* :  while troops were in the sleeping quarters
*02:22.180- 02:24.320* :  at the outpost known as Tower 22.
*02:25.060- 02:28.100* :  A US defense official said it came in very low
*02:28.220- 02:29.240* :  and very slow.
*02:29.780- 02:32.880* :  At the same time, an American drone was returning to base,
*02:33.420- 02:36.140* :  which meant air defences weren't able to stop it.
*02:36.620- 02:39.040* :  Islamic Resistance in Iraq is a new group,
*02:39.460- 02:41.900* :  formed at the start of the Israel Hamas war,
*02:41.900- 02:44.380* :  it said, in support of the people of Gaza.
*02:45.160- 02:47.720* :  But its members have for years targeted US sites
*02:47.720- 02:48.860* :  in Iraq and Syria.
*02:49.600- 02:51.880* :  The number and sophistication of the strikes
*02:51.880- 02:54.260* :  has increased dramatically since October.
*02:54.940- 02:57.680* :  America has responded with airstrikes of its own in Iraq,
*02:58.160- 02:59.840* :  including a drone attack in Baghdad
*02:59.840- 03:01.100* :  at the beginning of the month,
*03:01.500- 03:03.240* :  which killed a senior militant commander.
*03:03.880- 03:06.260* :  But Iran's proxies remain undeterred.
*03:06.760- 03:09.500* :  America has maintained a network of military outposts
*03:09.500- 03:12.400* :  across eastern Syria, Western Iraq and in Jordan,
*03:12.700- 03:14.220* :  some six and a half thousand troops
*03:14.220- 03:16.680* :  since the downfall of the Islamic State group,
*03:17.180- 03:19.120* :  ostensibly to prevent the group's return.
*03:20.060- 03:22.240* :  The killing of Americans will only add to fears
*03:22.240- 03:24.080* :  across the Middle East that the war in Gaza
*03:24.440- 03:26.240* :  will escalate into a wider conflict.
*03:26.820- 03:29.560* :  And politicians and diplomats across the region worry
*03:29.920- 03:31.940* :  that as the US election draws closer,
*03:32.460- 03:36.020* :  President Biden's ability to negotiate a truce is narrowing.
*03:36.660- 03:39.080* :  Like the pro-Iranian Lebanese group Hezbollah,
*03:39.380- 03:43.920* :  IRI suspended attacks during November's one week truce in Gaza,
*03:44.580- 03:46.320* :  but resumed at strikes when that ended.
*03:47.020- 03:48.780* :  Quentin Somerville in Beirut.
*03:49.240- 03:51.880* :  So what might the reaction from the US look like
*03:52.320- 03:54.600* :  our correspondent in Washington is Tom Bateman?
*03:55.040- 03:57.440* :  Well, everyone so far in Washington has been trying
*03:57.440- 03:58.780* :  to find out the answer to that.
*03:58.780- 04:01.420* :  And there have been various officials from the administration
*04:01.540- 04:04.860* :  who have been on the podium at various different briefings.
*04:04.860- 04:07.040* :  I mean, there was Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary.
*04:07.040- 04:08.720* :  We then heard from John Kirby,
*04:08.720- 04:10.960* :  the spokesman for the National Security Council.
*04:11.680- 04:12.560* :  But we don't know the details.
*04:12.560- 04:15.360* :  Remember that Iran hawks in Washington,
*04:15.360- 04:19.780* :  particularly Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for action
*04:20.320- 04:21.740* :  against Iran itself.
*04:22.300- 04:24.060* :  So strikes inside Iran.
*04:24.060- 04:25.720* :  Now that's not a surprising message,
*04:25.720- 04:28.340* :  but it ramps up the pressure on President Biden.
*04:28.520- 04:30.080* :  You know, and this is sort of critically important
*04:30.080- 04:32.160* :  in a presidential year whose opponents
*04:32.160- 04:35.720* :  have already portrayed him as weak on this issue.
*04:36.240- 04:39.480* :  So the administration knows that it needs to show something,
*04:40.280- 04:43.360* :  but it has to hold the line to this policy
*04:43.660- 04:48.320* :  of not trying to ignite a much wider war in the region.
*04:48.700- 04:51.660* :  That's going to be an extremely difficult thing to achieve.
*04:52.300- 04:55.340* :  President Biden met with his National Security officials
*04:55.340- 04:56.760* :  twice yesterday.
*04:56.820- 04:59.600* :  They will have presented him with a menu of options,
*05:00.560- 05:03.200* :  ranging from the kinds of responses
*05:03.200- 05:06.640* :  that we've seen so far by the US on Iran-back militias,
*05:07.060- 05:08.760* :  both in Syria and Iraq,
*05:08.760- 05:12.940* :  to probably much more focused targeted killings
*05:13.080- 05:15.940* :  of IRGC or Iranian Revolutionary Guard,
*05:16.500- 05:20.080* :  senior figures, right up through to attacks on Iranian soil.
*05:20.400- 05:22.180* :  But that's obviously going to be the response
*05:22.180- 05:24.500* :  that they will be trying to calibrate,
*05:24.900- 05:27.480* :  trying to avert a wider conflict,
*05:27.480- 05:30.120* :  but at the same time showing that they've responded forcefully.
*05:30.540- 05:31.860* :  Tom Bateman in Washington.
*05:32.560- 05:34.880* :  Meanwhile, more big donors have halted funding
*05:34.880- 05:36.660* :  for UN aid work in Gaza.
*05:36.660- 05:39.240* :  After Israel said about a dozen members of staff
*05:39.240- 05:41.220* :  of the UN Agency for Palestinians,
*05:41.220- 05:44.460* :  UNRA, had taken part in the Hamas massacre
*05:44.460- 05:45.640* :  of the 7th of October.
*05:46.120- 05:48.960* :  On Monday, Austria and Japan joined the likes of the US,
*05:49.380- 05:51.200* :  France, Britain, and Germany,
*05:51.600- 05:53.900* :  who have already paused their financial contributions.
*05:54.020- 05:56.860* :  At the same time, new details have emerged
*05:56.860- 05:59.280* :  from the Israeli intelligence dossier
*05:59.540- 06:00.980* :  on the alleged militants.
*06:01.500- 06:03.320* :  Here's Lipica Palem from our Middle East desk.
*06:03.820- 06:05.920* :  The contents of the Israeli dossier
*06:05.920- 06:08.300* :  were first reported by the New York Times.
*06:09.180- 06:12.100* :  The six-page document says that intelligence showed
*06:12.540- 06:14.400* :  nearly 200 UNRA workers,
*06:15.000- 06:16.680* :  including teachers were Hamas
*06:16.940- 06:18.660* :  or Islamic Jihad operatives
*06:19.040- 06:20.960* :  without providing detailed evidence.
*06:21.740- 06:24.980* :  It said that at least 12 workers crossed into Israel
*06:25.340- 06:26.640* :  on the 7th of October.
*06:27.180- 06:29.460* :  Of those, a school teacher and his son
*06:29.460- 06:31.400* :  from Han Unis in southern Gaza
*06:31.760- 06:33.020* :  were alleged to have helped
*06:33.340- 06:35.120* :  in the abduction of an Israeli woman.
*06:35.540- 06:38.340* :  Another two were said to have participated in raids
*06:38.340- 06:40.760* :  on southern Israeli farming communities.
*06:41.560- 06:44.960* :  An UNRA social worker from Nusserat in central Gaza
*06:44.960- 06:47.720* :  is accused of unspecified involvement
*06:47.720- 06:52.060* :  in the transfer to Gaza of the body of a dead Israeli soldier
*06:52.560- 06:55.020* :  and of coordinating the movements of pickup trucks
*06:55.020- 06:57.600* :  used by Hamas and other infiltrators.
*06:58.480- 07:01.380* :  One of the accused is also alleged to have armed himself
*07:01.380- 07:02.880* :  with an anti-tank missile.
*07:03.600- 07:06.600* :  The dossier reportedly claims that Israel's intelligence
*07:06.600- 07:10.160* :  is based on tracking the phones of six of the people,
*07:10.660- 07:12.480* :  monitoring the phone calls by others
*07:12.860- 07:15.400* :  who allegedly discussed their involvement in the attack
*07:15.400- 07:18.380* :  and text messages received by another three,
*07:18.880- 07:20.280* :  including one ordering him
*07:20.280- 07:23.840* :  to bring rocket-propelled grenades stored in his house.
*07:24.320- 07:27.540* :  UNRA which employs 13,000 people in Gaza
*07:27.960- 07:30.380* :  has sacked nine employees over the allegations
*07:30.440- 07:33.440* :  which it says it is still investigating.
*07:33.980- 07:34.780* :  Lippaker Pellum.
*07:35.220- 07:38.540* :  The US has said it's important not to blame all UNRA staff
*07:38.540- 07:41.300* :  and that the agency had helped save thousands of lives
*07:41.300- 07:42.120* :  in Gaza.
*07:42.640- 07:44.880* :  UNRA says if the funding freeze continues,
*07:44.880- 07:48.100* :  it will have to cease its work as early as next month.
*07:48.600- 07:50.380* :  As many as two million people in Gaza
*07:50.380- 07:53.280* :  are reliant on the agency for humanitarian assistance
*07:53.280- 07:53.960* :  and shelter.
*07:54.580- 07:57.760* :  One of them is Garda Al-Kherd, a freelance journalist
*07:57.920- 07:58.960* :  from Gaza City.
*07:58.960- 08:01.580* :  She and her family were displaced to Khan Unis
*08:01.580- 08:03.300* :  where they stayed in an UNRA shelter.
*08:03.860- 08:05.480* :  She spoke to Tim Franks from Rafa.
*08:05.940- 08:08.060* :  We've been in a shelter for three months.
*08:08.280- 08:12.120* :  UNRA actually was providing us with a shelter, water,
*08:12.520- 08:15.740* :  food, humanitarian aid, some medical supplies.
*08:16.000- 08:18.280* :  The building has a big yard,
*08:18.620- 08:21.500* :  so we can build tents inside this yard.
*08:21.860- 08:24.640* :  There were many of UNRA schools beside us,
*08:24.700- 08:28.880* :  so they were providing many assistance for these schools.
*08:29.240- 08:31.680* :  Before October 7th,
*08:31.800- 08:35.160* :  did you or your family have any reliance
*08:35.160- 08:37.180* :  on the services that UNRA provided?
*08:37.560- 08:40.600* :  For some periods, we have some humanitarian aid from UNRA.
*08:41.020- 08:44.260* :  Our children, they are learning inside UNRA schools.
*08:44.760- 08:47.760* :  If we are sick, we are going to the UNRA clinics
*08:47.760- 08:51.180* :  and we have free medication for chronic disease,
*08:51.180- 08:52.880* :  diabetes, high blood depression.
*08:53.160- 08:55.400* :  And if we have blood tests, we are going
*08:55.400- 08:57.420* :  and for a pregnancy, actually, for a woman.
*08:57.640- 08:59.060* :  So we can go to this clinic
*08:59.060- 09:01.100* :  and we have good medical care.
*09:01.240- 09:03.560* :  If UNRA had to stop operating,
*09:03.620- 09:06.980* :  do you think that other humanitarian agencies
*09:06.980- 09:10.560* :  could begin to replace what UNRA does?
*09:11.080- 09:14.980* :  UNRA has been working in Palestinian criticism since 75 years.
*09:15.600- 09:18.320* :  So most of the people are depending on AIDS
*09:18.320- 09:19.520* :  and sub-border from UNRA.
*09:19.520- 09:22.280* :  If it will be cut with the hunger
*09:22.280- 09:23.320* :  and the starvation,
*09:23.320- 09:26.100* :  because of what the people are facing right now,
*09:26.100- 09:30.420* :  it will increase this catastrophe for a displaced people.
*09:30.860- 09:34.200* :  People need UNRA immediate time now.
*09:34.420- 09:36.700* :  So cutting the support from UNRA
*09:36.700- 09:39.440* :  will be a big problem for people here.
*09:39.620- 09:41.820* :  Arda Al-Qaeda talking to Tim Franks.
*09:42.080- 09:44.080* :  There are grounds to believe that war crimes
*09:44.080- 09:46.500* :  are being committed in the Darfur region of Sudan,
*09:46.620- 09:49.960* :  according to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.
*09:50.540- 09:53.180* :  Karim Khan said it was his clear assessment
*09:53.180- 09:56.880* :  that both the army and the paramilitary rapid support forces
*09:56.880- 09:59.820* :  or RSF were carrying out crimes in Darfur.
*09:59.820- 10:02.140* :  He was briefing the UN Security Council
*10:02.140- 10:04.340* :  during a visit to refugee camps in Chad.
*10:04.940- 10:07.260* :  More than 13,000 people have been killed
*10:07.700- 10:10.660* :  and over 10 million displaced since fighting broke out
*10:10.660- 10:13.840* :  between Sudan's armed forces and the RSF.
*10:14.320- 10:16.580* :  The BBC's Anne Saw reports from Nairobi.
*10:17.100- 10:19.020* :  Karim Khan told the Security Council
*10:19.020- 10:22.180* :  that his investigations will center on Al-Janina in Darfur
*10:22.500- 10:25.600* :  where hundreds of non-Arab people were targeted, killed,
*10:25.620- 10:28.680* :  women raped and their homes set on fire.
*10:29.320- 10:30.980* :  The attacks were condemned internationally
*10:30.980- 10:33.240* :  as having the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing
*10:33.780- 10:36.560* :  and echoing atrocities committed nearly two decades ago
*10:36.920- 10:37.780* :  in the same region.
*10:38.640- 10:41.100* :  The prosecutor said the failure to deliver justice
*10:41.100- 10:44.240* :  then had invigorated a climate of impunity now.
*10:44.920- 10:46.480* :  He appealed for access to the country
*10:46.480- 10:47.760* :  to conduct investigations.
*10:48.540- 10:50.060* :  The Sudanese government, he said,
*10:50.060- 10:54.160* :  has not answered 35 requests for assistance from his office.
*10:55.040- 10:57.840* :  Meanwhile, the US has designated the Interior Minister
*10:57.840- 11:00.280* :  who served under former President Omar al-Bashir,
*11:00.680- 11:04.260* :  Ahmad Muhammad Haroon, offering a reward of $5 million
*11:04.340- 11:06.560* :  for information leading to his arrest
*11:06.900- 11:09.040* :  over past war crimes in Darfur.
*11:09.400- 11:11.480* :  And that was Anne Saway reporting.
*11:12.300- 11:15.120* :  Taylor Swift featured prominently in TV coverage
*11:15.120- 11:17.620* :  of the American Football Conference Championship Game
*11:17.620- 11:21.100* :  on Sunday, but type her name into X or Twitter
*11:21.420- 11:22.700* :  and a message pops up.
*11:22.700- 11:25.520* :  Something went wrong, try reloading.
*11:25.980- 11:28.160* :  The social media giant blocked searches
*11:28.160- 11:31.560* :  after explicit fake images of the star were posted to the site.
*11:31.900- 11:34.660* :  One was reportedly viewed 47 million times.
*11:35.400- 11:37.620* :  It's just the latest example of the proliferation
*11:37.620- 11:40.160* :  of AI-generated images and audio clips
*11:40.160- 11:41.940* :  of celebrities and politicians.
*11:42.680- 11:46.160* :  The BBC's Nick Robinson asked an expert in deepfakes,
*11:46.160- 11:50.280* :  Professor Hanif Fareed, whether he welcomed the action
*11:50.280- 11:51.340* :  taken by X.
*11:51.880- 11:54.500* :  It's not nearly enough because what you have to understand
*11:54.500- 11:56.920* :  about this type of content is there are many players
*11:56.920- 11:58.500* :  in the field that enable it.
*11:58.740- 12:00.380* :  There's, of course, the underlying technology
*12:00.380- 12:01.380* :  that creates the content.
*12:01.400- 12:03.120* :  There's the people creating the content.
*12:03.140- 12:05.820* :  There's the platforms distributing the content.
*12:06.120- 12:08.020* :  But there's also the financial institutions
*12:08.220- 12:10.120* :  that allow these companies to monetize it.
*12:10.120- 12:12.320* :  Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, American Express.
*12:12.620- 12:15.100* :  There's the Googles of the world where if you go to Google
*12:15.100- 12:17.880* :  and you search, find me deep fake news of Taylor Swift,
*12:17.900- 12:19.460* :  it will gladly surface it.
*12:19.600- 12:20.960* :  So there's a whole infrastructure
*12:20.960- 12:25.220* :  that is profiting off of this digital violence against women.
*12:25.440- 12:27.300* :  And so great, you're gonna deal with it for now,
*12:27.300- 12:29.640* :  but we know that this problem is going to persist
*12:29.860- 12:31.780* :  and we're late to the game as we often are
*12:31.780- 12:33.320* :  when it comes to these online harms.
*12:33.500- 12:37.220* :  Deepfakes hit the scene maybe in 2016 or so,
*12:37.520- 12:39.920* :  but the images in the video and the audio weren't very good.
*12:39.920- 12:42.340* :  Very grainy and didn't look very realistic.
*12:42.700- 12:44.620* :  And what has happened over the years
*12:44.620- 12:45.440* :  is a few things.
*12:45.720- 12:48.280* :  The content is looking more and more realistic.
*12:48.280- 12:51.420* :  But what's also happened is it's not just the Taylor Swift's
*12:51.580- 12:52.840* :  that are vulnerable to this.
*12:53.140- 12:56.520* :  It's also anybody who has a single image of themselves online
*12:56.520- 12:59.340* :  can now be inserted into sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, and material.
*12:59.740- 13:00.800* :  And then of course that content
*13:00.800- 13:02.780* :  can be carved bond across the internet.
*13:03.020- 13:04.640* :  And this year with more elections
*13:04.640- 13:06.760* :  across the globe than ever before,
*13:06.760- 13:08.220* :  it can be used in politics.
*13:08.500- 13:10.480* :  We have seen it in Slovakia in Bangladesh.
*13:10.480- 13:13.060* :  We were seeing it in Mexico and we saw it here last week.
*13:13.220- 13:14.100* :  Here in the United States,
*13:14.100- 13:16.180* :  we have our first primary in New Hampshire.
*13:16.180- 13:18.680* :  The day before election, there were robocalls
*13:18.740- 13:19.840* :  in the state of New Hampshire
*13:20.200- 13:22.080* :  by what sounded like President Biden
*13:22.080- 13:24.040* :  telling people not to vote in the primary
*13:24.040- 13:26.780* :  to save their vote for the national election.
*13:26.780- 13:29.920* :  Clear, unambiguous attempt to manipulate our elections.
*13:30.140- 13:32.500* :  A robocall, you mean an automated telephone call?
*13:32.640- 13:33.840* :  So when you pick up the phone,
*13:33.840- 13:35.300* :  you think the president's on the line.
*13:35.480- 13:37.440* :  Correct. I mean, I think people thought it was a recording,
*13:37.440- 13:39.760* :  of course, but nonetheless, you hear a call
*13:39.760- 13:41.560* :  and it's very easy to manipulate voters.
*13:41.620- 13:43.600* :  In fact, you don't have to manipulate many voters.
*13:43.600- 13:45.600* :  National elections here in the US
*13:45.600- 13:48.400* :  are made or lost with tens of thousands of votes.
*13:48.400- 13:50.840* :  You don't have to move millions, you have to move thousands.
*13:51.200- 13:52.700* :  In order to deal with this,
*13:52.700- 13:55.980* :  is this legislation to say to all these corporations,
*13:55.980- 13:59.340* :  you must refuse to take these sites and to take this money?
*13:59.500- 14:00.260* :  We need a lot of things.
*14:00.260- 14:01.040* :  We need education.
*14:01.140- 14:03.060* :  We need people to understand they're being manipulated.
*14:03.060- 14:06.060* :  I think we have to hold the various infrastructures
*14:06.260- 14:07.820* :  that are allowing this type of technology
*14:07.820- 14:10.100* :  to be created and distributed, responsible.
*14:10.100- 14:12.980* :  And you are 100% right that this is a global response.
*14:13.540- 14:15.480* :  The US is 5% of the world's population.
*14:15.480- 14:19.160* :  We can't pull these 95% of the internet outside the US.
*14:19.160- 14:20.640* :  So we need global cooperation
*14:20.640- 14:22.540* :  to hold these companies responsible
*14:22.800- 14:24.320* :  for the harms that they are producing
*14:24.320- 14:26.920* :  to individual societies and democracies.
*14:27.480- 14:29.600* :  Anne, for read, Professor of Computer Science
*14:29.620- 14:30.960* :  at the University of California,
*14:31.500- 14:33.020* :  Berkeley, talking to Nick Robinson.
*14:34.300- 14:37.740* :  Very little is known about how great white sharks reproduce.
*14:38.580- 14:40.840* :  However, a YouTuber and drone operator
*14:40.840- 14:43.740* :  may have taken a video of something never seen before.
*14:44.460- 14:46.020* :  A newborn, great white.
*14:46.020- 14:47.940* :  The details were published in the Journal
*14:47.940- 14:49.980* :  of Environmental Biology of Fishes.
*14:50.600- 14:52.960* :  James Clayton in California has this report.
*14:55.300- 14:58.240* :  Victoria is swimming in the cool Pacific Ocean,
*14:58.540- 15:00.040* :  just south of Santa Barbara.
*15:00.620- 15:01.880* :  Floating in the calm water,
*15:02.380- 15:05.840* :  she's totally oblivious to who she's sharing the water with.
*15:06.480- 15:08.060* :  In fact, there's not one,
*15:08.520- 15:11.680* :  but four great white sharks swimming at this beach.
*15:12.280- 15:14.260* :  We know this because Carlos Gowner
*15:14.480- 15:16.540* :  has been flying his drone here all day.
*15:16.680- 15:19.140* :  The fin of one shark breaks the water.
*15:19.760- 15:20.800* :  She's out, look at that thing.
*15:21.240- 15:22.160* :  You can see it good.
*15:22.500- 15:25.140* :  Carlos is a YouTuber and shark fanatic,
*15:25.140- 15:28.500* :  who is frankly amazing at finding sharks with his drone.
*15:28.900- 15:31.020* :  The shark is about 60 meters away,
*15:31.020- 15:32.940* :  but it's really difficult to see.
*15:33.340- 15:35.480* :  So from here, you have no idea
*15:35.480- 15:37.380* :  there was a great white shark out there
*15:37.380- 15:40.460* :  because it's almost impossible to see it from the beach.
*15:40.580- 15:41.860* :  And that's why drones are so important
*15:41.860- 15:44.000* :  because you have to be almost on top of it
*15:44.300- 15:45.380* :  to actually see them.
*15:45.860- 15:48.200* :  So drones, when you're viewing a shark,
*15:49.000- 15:51.020* :  you're basically viewing the sharks
*15:51.080- 15:52.320* :  through a magnifying glass
*15:52.320- 15:54.180* :  if they don't know who's watching them.
*15:54.620- 15:57.260* :  Finding a shark, though, isn't always easy.
*15:57.420- 15:57.540* :  Go.
*15:59.160- 16:01.360* :  Sometimes those pieces of kelp floating
*16:01.360- 16:03.100* :  trick you into thinking it's a shark.
*16:05.940- 16:06.560* :  Do you hear the ding?
*16:07.380- 16:08.040* :  We got a shark.
*16:09.400- 16:11.480* :  From the sky, Carlos captures moments
*16:11.480- 16:14.060* :  that will be hard to see with the naked eye.
*16:14.500- 16:17.420* :  Scientists who are also interested in Carlos' footage
*16:17.960- 16:19.160* :  have taken an interest.
*16:19.640- 16:22.040* :  Phil Sterns is a local marine biologist
*16:22.040- 16:25.580* :  and researcher at the University of California Riverside.
*16:25.580- 16:28.200* :  He was with Carlos when they stumbled
*16:28.220- 16:30.480* :  across something they'd never seen before.
*16:30.720- 16:32.880* :  So I'm like, well, that sharks eating very well
*16:33.260- 16:34.800* :  or it might be carrying some pops inside.
*16:34.980- 16:37.080* :  The female just was acting erratically.
*16:37.180- 16:38.260* :  She dove, disappeared,
*16:38.740- 16:40.080* :  and guess what came up from underneath.
*16:40.940- 16:45.300* :  This little bitty, white, almost albino-looking white shark.
*16:45.680- 16:46.940* :  So it's called a white shark.
*16:47.260- 16:48.920* :  That's the species, it's a white shark,
*16:48.920- 16:51.660* :  but this shark was actually completely white in color.
*16:51.840- 16:52.520* :  I was looking at the video,
*16:52.520- 16:54.740* :  I'm like, the fins, they're differently shaped.
*16:54.740- 16:55.520* :  They're more rounded.
*16:55.520- 16:58.280* :  I'm like, that's not an older white shark.
*16:58.300- 16:59.560* :  That's a very young white shark.
*16:59.600- 17:00.440* :  This could be a newborn.
*17:00.440- 17:02.560* :  I'm like, oh my goodness, this could be a newborn.
*17:02.840- 17:04.380* :  One of the greatest mysteries
*17:04.380- 17:06.980* :  in great white shark science is reproduction.
*17:07.480- 17:10.160* :  The holy grail of white shark research
*17:11.040- 17:13.260* :  is the birth of a great white shark.
*17:13.980- 17:16.900* :  And I believe that that is probably the closest
*17:16.900- 17:20.480* :  we've ever been to the actual birth of a great white shark.
*17:20.840- 17:23.680* :  Other experts like Chris Lowe, a shark scientist
*17:23.680- 17:26.300* :  at California State University Long Beach,
*17:26.660- 17:29.420* :  accept that this could be a historic discovery,
*17:29.420- 17:31.640* :  but they need to see more evidence.
*17:31.700- 17:34.160* :  The problem that I have as a scientist
*17:34.160- 17:36.780* :  is what we call a sample size of one.
*17:37.440- 17:39.240* :  Sure, this could be a newborn shark
*17:39.240- 17:41.240* :  or it could be a shark with a skin disease.
*17:41.780- 17:43.160* :  And a lot of people ask, well,
*17:43.160- 17:44.600* :  what would it take to convince you
*17:45.220- 17:47.280* :  that this is a popping area?
*17:47.620- 17:49.940* :  And I would say I would need to see babies
*17:49.940- 17:51.080* :  coming out of a female.
*17:51.660- 17:55.240* :  Chris Lowe ending that report by James Clayton in California.
*17:56.580- 17:58.720* :  Now it's nearly two years since Russia launched
*17:58.720- 18:00.500* :  its full scale invasion of Ukraine.
*18:00.500- 18:04.200* :  The conflict is no longer at the top of the news agenda,
*18:04.700- 18:07.860* :  but it could still pose an existential threat to us all.
*18:07.860- 18:10.380* :  At least if the Ukrainian president is to be believed.
*18:10.800- 18:12.700* :  Vladimir Zelensky has said that fighting
*18:12.700- 18:15.180* :  will escalate into a third world war
*18:15.180- 18:17.880* :  if Russian aggression isn't contained in Ukraine.
*18:18.460- 18:20.940* :  There is currently little sign of Russia being defeated
*18:20.940- 18:22.180* :  on the battlefield there.
*18:22.240- 18:24.500* :  So where does the war go from here?
*18:25.180- 18:26.740* :  Well, it's coincide with the second anniversary
*18:26.740- 18:28.460* :  on the 24th of February.
*18:28.460- 18:30.260* :  We are gonna join forces with our friends
*18:30.260- 18:33.640* :  at Ukrainecast to answer any questions you may have.
*18:33.820- 18:35.100* :  So if there's something you'd like to know
*18:35.100- 18:38.240* :  about the fighting in Ukraine or the situation in Russia,
*18:38.760- 18:41.760* :  please email us and record a voice note if you can
*18:41.800- 18:43.600* :  so we can play it in the podcast.
*18:43.660- 18:47.960* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk
*18:47.960- 18:51.260* :  and you can also tweet us on ex at Global NewsPod.
*18:54.060- 18:56.340* :  Still to come on the Global NewsPod,
*18:56.860- 18:58.820* :  the British Prime Minister Rishisunak
*18:58.820- 19:00.280* :  lets us in on a secret.
*19:00.720- 19:02.660* :  I tend to try and do some fasting
*19:03.040- 19:04.080* :  at the beginning of every week
*19:04.080- 19:06.620* :  as a part of a general balanced lifestyle,
*19:06.940- 19:09.060* :  but I also have a weakness for sugary things,
*19:09.060- 19:11.360* :  which I indulge in in the rest of the week.
*19:11.800- 19:14.380* :  We'll air about the pros and cons of fasting.
*19:23.720- 19:25.000* :  Across Europe in recent weeks,
*19:25.000- 19:27.540* :  farmers have downed tools and blocked road
*19:27.540- 19:30.060* :  in protest at national and EU policies
*19:30.520- 19:31.960* :  they think are making them poorer.
*19:32.620- 19:34.580* :  On Monday, there were demonstrations in Belgium
*19:34.580- 19:37.020* :  and Germany and a big one in France.
*19:43.400- 19:44.960* :  The French farmers used their tractors
*19:44.960- 19:47.400* :  to block major motorways around Paris
*19:47.400- 19:49.220* :  to try to seal off the capital.
*19:49.420- 19:51.640* :  They're angry at what they see as low prices
*19:51.640- 19:54.700* :  for their produce, the high cost of environmental regulation
*19:54.700- 19:57.260* :  and unfair competition from cheaper imports.
*19:57.780- 19:59.800* :  Pascal de Prey is a grain farmer
*20:00.380- 20:01.220* :  involved in the demonstration.
*20:01.820- 20:04.880* :  We're here because we're honestly unhappy
*20:04.880- 20:07.660* :  with the current policies in terms of agriculture.
*20:08.500- 20:10.480* :  We're especially overwhelmed with rules
*20:10.480- 20:13.720* :  that prevent us from working under lower-hour yields.
*20:14.680- 20:15.940* :  And so we're calling on Macron
*20:16.500- 20:18.360* :  to put in place more realistic rules
*20:18.360- 20:20.160* :  or even remove them altogether.
*20:20.800- 20:22.620* :  That would be great progress.
*20:25.000- 20:26.320* :  Well, our correspondent, Bethany Bale,
*20:26.320- 20:27.540* :  spoke to me from a motorway
*20:27.540- 20:29.460* :  on the northeast outskirts of Paris.
*20:30.020- 20:33.160* :  Another tractor has just pulled up in front of me
*20:33.160- 20:36.620* :  bringing yet another great big bail of hay
*20:36.660- 20:40.420* :  to join the great blockade of hay bales
*20:40.420- 20:44.380* :  which is completely blocking this major motorway
*20:44.420- 20:46.860* :  which is very close to Shardagall Airport
*20:46.860- 20:50.020* :  every so often we see planes flying over from there.
*20:50.420- 20:53.460* :  And behind these great bales of hay
*20:53.820- 20:56.020* :  which have got flags on top of them
*20:56.340- 20:59.140* :  is an enormous line of tractors
*20:59.500- 21:01.500* :  stretching as far back as I can see
*21:02.040- 21:03.660* :  with blinking lights on.
*21:04.080- 21:06.060* :  And famously, they say they'll stay here
*21:06.340- 21:07.540* :  simply as long as it takes
*21:08.220- 21:11.460* :  because they see the situation as being untenable.
*21:11.460- 21:15.320* :  One man told me, we cannot live from our work.
*21:15.920- 21:18.900* :  Now, he said you were relatively near Shardagall Airport.
*21:18.940- 21:21.820* :  I thought the French authorities were ring fencing that
*21:21.900- 21:23.320* :  so that it could stay open.
*21:23.600- 21:26.460* :  We do understand that the road between Shardagall
*21:26.460- 21:29.480* :  and central Paris is being ring fenced
*21:29.480- 21:33.060* :  but this is the A1 motorway between Paris and Neil
*21:33.480- 21:35.800* :  which is well and truly blocked at this moment.
*21:35.940- 21:38.700* :  Yeah, quite a busy route on a normal day, I imagine.
*21:38.700- 21:40.420* :  What is the impact of this protest
*21:40.980- 21:42.420* :  on other people in France?
*21:42.900- 21:44.560* :  It's been a great deal of disruption
*21:44.640- 21:47.860* :  because there are a number of different blockades
*21:47.860- 21:50.560* :  like this in the area around Paris.
*21:51.100- 21:53.100* :  And what the farmers say they want to do
*21:53.100- 21:55.880* :  is to prevent food being delivered into the capital.
*21:55.880- 21:58.800* :  And one farmer even said they wanted Paris to starve
*21:59.160- 22:02.020* :  in order to make their demands felt.
*22:02.400- 22:06.280* :  Now, this is a part of a wider movement across Europe.
*22:06.420- 22:08.640* :  Is this something that's going to have to be addressed in Brussels?
*22:08.920- 22:11.000* :  Yes, certainly we've seen similar protests
*22:11.000- 22:13.620* :  happening in the Netherlands and Belgium and Germany
*22:14.160- 22:15.480* :  here within France as well.
*22:15.480- 22:18.540* :  There are many demands being made by farmers
*22:18.540- 22:21.440* :  and what we seem to be hearing a lot of
*22:21.860- 22:25.840* :  is a complaint that there's low food prices
*22:26.320- 22:28.240* :  and that the recent push by the government
*22:28.240- 22:30.140* :  to bring down costs for consumers
*22:30.600- 22:32.360* :  has left them struggling to cope.
*22:32.740- 22:35.860* :  They also don't like competition from other countries
*22:35.860- 22:38.660* :  that have lower environmental standards
*22:39.340- 22:42.280* :  and many of them saying that this is something
*22:42.280- 22:43.840* :  that really needs to be addressed.
*22:43.980- 22:46.900* :  Bethany Bell on the outskirts of the French capital.
*22:47.620- 22:50.100* :  Spanish police have arrested the owners and staff
*22:50.100- 22:52.060* :  at a funeral parlour in Valencia
*22:52.060- 22:55.660* :  for allegedly selling dead bodies to universities for research.
*22:56.240- 22:57.820* :  The former men are also accused of profiting
*22:57.820- 23:01.180* :  from the disposal of the bodies after they've been dissected.
*23:01.640- 23:04.240* :  Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhard, has the details.
*23:04.880- 23:06.920* :  The police account describes a lucrative
*23:06.920- 23:08.460* :  if macabre a trade.
*23:09.120- 23:10.840* :  The gang is set to have targeted people
*23:10.840- 23:12.400* :  who have known known relatives
*23:12.400- 23:15.260* :  and who died in hospitals and old people's homes,
*23:15.840- 23:17.840* :  those who'd lived in precarious circumstances
*23:18.480- 23:19.600* :  and preferably foreigners.
*23:20.500- 23:22.340* :  Police say the gang falsified documents
*23:22.340- 23:25.780* :  then sold each corpse for research for $1,300.
*23:27.100- 23:28.580* :  They're alleged to have made more money
*23:28.580- 23:30.660* :  by charging universities to incinerate
*23:30.700- 23:32.180* :  the dissected cadavers.
*23:32.880- 23:35.280* :  One university paid more than $5,000
*23:35.280- 23:36.900* :  to burn 11 bodies.
*23:37.820- 23:40.040* :  Police suspect the men of putting body parts
*23:40.040- 23:42.520* :  in other people's coffins before cremation,
*23:42.540- 23:44.400* :  saving money in the process.
*23:45.100- 23:45.920* :  Danny Eberhard.
*23:46.600- 23:48.800* :  The Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Maloney,
*23:48.800- 23:51.240* :  has announced details of a proposed partnership
*23:51.240- 23:54.220* :  with African countries, covering energy, investment
*23:54.220- 23:56.020* :  and agreements on migration.
*23:56.660- 23:58.840* :  She presented what's called the Mate plan
*23:58.840- 24:01.380* :  to Parliament and a summit of African leaders.
*24:01.500- 24:05.600* :  Her government says it will commit $6 billion initially.
*24:06.060- 24:09.040* :  Leo Garetti is head of the Italian foreign policy program
*24:09.040- 24:12.060* :  at the Institute for International Affairs in Rome.
*24:12.720- 24:15.920* :  Tim Franks asked what part of the plan had caught his eye?
*24:16.560- 24:20.060* :  The idea is quite interesting and innovative
*24:20.060- 24:23.840* :  in that Italy is trying to present itself
*24:23.840- 24:27.980* :  as a protagonist in reshaping the relationship with Africa.
*24:28.320- 24:31.740* :  This is obviously due to concerns about migration
*24:31.740- 24:35.860* :  in the country as well as a wider geopolitical
*24:35.860- 24:37.360* :  and geoeconomic vision.
*24:37.360- 24:40.960* :  The real point is exactly what kind of projects
*24:40.960- 24:43.040* :  this plan will encompass.
*24:43.380- 24:45.540* :  And especially whether Italy will be able
*24:45.540- 24:48.080* :  to have other partners around it
*24:48.180- 24:51.140* :  because to be frank, Italy on its own
*24:51.560- 24:53.760* :  and the Prime Minister Maloney is well aware of that
*24:54.220- 24:57.140* :  doesn't have the resources, the capabilities,
*24:57.140- 25:01.080* :  the expertise to put forward a plan for a continent,
*25:01.080- 25:04.840* :  which nowadays has about one and a half billion people.
*25:05.180- 25:08.480* :  Yeah, absolutely fair point that $6 billion may sound
*25:08.480- 25:11.360* :  like a fair amount, but given what a huge issue
*25:11.660- 25:14.320* :  migration from Africa to southern Europe is,
*25:14.320- 25:16.620* :  you might wonder how much difference it would make.
*25:17.000- 25:21.440* :  She did have the European Commission President alongside her.
*25:21.660- 25:24.200* :  Does that suggest there could be wider support?
*25:24.680- 25:25.980* :  She has a very good relationship
*25:25.980- 25:30.000* :  with a European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
*25:30.000- 25:33.400* :  The real point, however, is to check whether
*25:33.740- 25:35.600* :  the other big European countries,
*25:35.840- 25:38.900* :  and I'm thinking especially about France and Germany here,
*25:39.460- 25:40.520* :  will follow suit.
*25:40.760- 25:43.440* :  And this may be one of the concerns, perhaps,
*25:43.440- 25:47.520* :  of this project that's working multilateral institutions.
*25:47.700- 25:52.000* :  It remains to be seen whether the key partners in Europe
*25:52.000- 25:56.100* :  for Italy also given the focus on the southern shores
*25:56.100- 25:58.920* :  of the Mediterranean will be involved too.
*25:59.120- 26:02.620* :  Or whether this will actually create some kind of competition
*26:03.020- 26:04.980* :  in the relationship with African countries,
*26:04.980- 26:08.380* :  which would be overall detrimental to the interest
*26:08.380- 26:10.080* :  of everyone in Italy itself.
*26:10.240- 26:11.780* :  And what sort of African countries
*26:11.780- 26:13.680* :  appear to be on board with her plans?
*26:14.260- 26:16.620* :  Italy has developed over the years
*26:16.620- 26:18.640* :  very strong energy relationship
*26:18.640- 26:23.860* :  with some North African countries, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt,
*26:23.900- 26:27.880* :  as well Libya, as well as some countries lately
*26:27.880- 26:31.580* :  in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Republic of the Congo,
*26:32.120- 26:35.180* :  Mozambique, and there were also projects
*26:35.180- 26:38.340* :  announced with the Ivory Coast, for example, or Ethiopia.
*26:38.860- 26:42.180* :  The point, however, is that at the summit today,
*26:42.180- 26:45.160* :  there were representatives from key countries
*26:45.160- 26:49.220* :  in the Sahel, like Burkina, Niger, or Mali,
*26:49.400- 26:52.580* :  and even not representatives from Nigeria,
*26:53.100- 26:56.980* :  which is the most popular and one of the key actors, obviously,
*26:57.460- 26:58.340* :  in that scenario.
*26:58.340- 27:01.060* :  So, obviously, the number of partners
*27:01.060- 27:03.600* :  which have been involved is substantial.
*27:03.600- 27:06.860* :  There were 46 countries represented today,
*27:06.860- 27:10.100* :  but there are still some gaps, which would need to be filled.
*27:10.560- 27:13.560* :  Leo Geretti of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome.
*27:14.460- 27:16.240* :  The British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunag,
*27:16.240- 27:18.500* :  doesn't talk much about his personal life,
*27:18.980- 27:21.780* :  though the T-Totler admits to a couple of vices
*27:21.780- 27:24.000* :  like eating peppermint bark chocolate
*27:24.560- 27:27.440* :  and drinking Mexican Coca-Cola made with cane sugar.
*27:28.120- 27:30.680* :  Now, though, he's revealed that he doesn't eat a tall
*27:30.680- 27:33.360* :  for 36 hours at the start of every week,
*27:33.740- 27:37.980* :  fasting from 5 p.m. on a Sunday until 5 a.m. on Tuesday.
*27:38.500- 27:41.660* :  As Shivon Lehi reports, he's been talking about it to the BBC.
*27:42.140- 27:44.020* :  I'm not sure if people are that interested in my diet,
*27:44.020- 27:46.140* :  but I tend to try and do some fasting
*27:46.140- 27:50.120* :  at the beginning of every week as part of a general balance lifestyle,
*27:50.420- 27:52.540* :  but I also have a weakness for sugary things,
*27:52.540- 27:54.840* :  which I indulge in in the rest of the week.
*27:54.960- 27:57.800* :  Many have wondered if fasting was part of his Hindu religion
*27:57.800- 27:59.940* :  or just part of his fitness regime.
*28:00.380- 28:01.080* :  Or maybe both.
*28:01.660- 28:04.460* :  Sita Sujak is a teacher at the Hindu Academy in London.
*28:04.460- 28:07.500* :  She explains the Hindu principles behind fasting.
*28:07.920- 28:11.880* :  The reason why we do fasting is we want to show discipline over ourselves.
*28:12.460- 28:15.160* :  We want to say that we are not just a physical body,
*28:15.160- 28:16.660* :  there is something more to us.
*28:16.820- 28:20.740* :  And what we'd like to do whenever we participate in fasting is to say,
*28:21.140- 28:23.380* :  you know, what body I am in control of you
*28:23.460- 28:24.940* :  and you are not in control of me.
*28:25.040- 28:26.700* :  So I don't have to eat and drink anything
*28:26.700- 28:28.180* :  and everything that is in sight.
*28:28.180- 28:32.060* :  The wonderful thing in Hinduism is that there is no set in junctions
*28:32.060- 28:35.580* :  saying everyone must fast because it's a very personal decision
*28:35.580- 28:38.900* :  whether you want to fast or if you don't want to even fast at all.
*28:39.000- 28:43.080* :  Dr Sarah Jarvis is a clinical consultant for patient.info.
*28:43.080- 28:47.060* :  She says that intermittent fasting may improve the health of your gut bacteria
*28:47.640- 28:49.460* :  and explains just how fasting works.
*28:49.680- 28:52.900* :  What's happening when you fast is your body is using different compounds
*28:53.340- 28:54.480* :  for their energy source.
*28:54.480- 28:57.120* :  For the first few hours, then your body is pulling out
*28:57.120- 28:59.960* :  what's called glycogen stores in your fat cells
*29:00.340- 29:02.760* :  and they're providing energy because those carbohydrates,
*29:02.780- 29:07.120* :  which normally our bodies use for energy are not there.
*29:07.440- 29:13.300* :  What then happens between sort of 12 and 36 as later is you start using ketones.
*29:13.600- 29:16.760* :  You're in a state of ketosis and it's at that stage that it's not necessarily
*29:16.860- 29:20.120* :  as helpful and there may well be more risks to it.
*29:20.220- 29:24.460* :  Dr Stress that if you're thinking about fasting, then get some medical advice first.
*29:24.680- 29:26.200* :  Daraport by Shivon Lehi.
*29:27.200- 29:29.380* :  Finally, the legendary singer, Joni Mitchell,
*29:29.380- 29:32.860* :  will perform for the first time at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles this weekend.
*29:33.340- 29:35.740* :  Almost nine years after a near fatal illness,
*29:35.740- 29:38.820* :  left her having to relearn how to walk and play the guitar.
*29:39.360- 29:41.120* :  The Canadian-born singer, Songwriter,
*29:41.120- 29:42.980* :  only recently returned to performing.
*29:43.020- 29:46.580* :  Our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson has the story.
*29:47.100- 29:50.880* :  I've looked at clouds from both sides now.
*29:51.840- 29:54.940* :  Joni Mitchell first won a Grammy in March 1970
*29:54.940- 29:57.820* :  when clouds was named bestful performance.
*29:58.600- 30:02.160* :  This Sunday, almost 54 years later and at the age of 80,
*30:02.160- 30:05.120* :  she is going to make her Grammy's debut as a performer
*30:05.120- 30:07.340* :  on a lineup including Billie Eilish,
*30:07.400- 30:11.280* :  Duolipa and the Nigerian Afrofusion star burner boy.
*30:11.440- 30:14.800* :  Don't it always seem to go that you don't know?
*30:14.800- 30:17.520* :  This is Joni Mitchell's latest step in a remarkable comeback
*30:17.520- 30:20.620* :  after suffering a brain aneurysm in 2015,
*30:20.620- 30:23.120* :  which left her having to learn to walk again.
*30:23.700- 30:25.820* :  Music played a huge part in her recovery,
*30:25.820- 30:29.260* :  with Joni Jams taking place in her Laurel Canyon home,
*30:29.260- 30:31.880* :  organized by the singer Brandy Carlyle,
*30:32.160- 30:33.980* :  who recruited the likes of Elton John,
*30:33.980- 30:35.940* :  Paul McCartney and Herbie Hancock,
*30:36.340- 30:37.960* :  to come and play in her living room.
*30:38.160- 30:40.620* :  Joni Mitchell, archives volume one.
*30:40.800- 30:44.480* :  By 2022, she was well enough to go on stage at the Grammys
*30:44.480- 30:46.800* :  after winning best historical album.
*30:46.800- 30:49.640* :  It was telling that her acceptance speech included
*30:49.640- 30:53.300* :  a special mention for someone crucial to her rehabilitation.
*30:53.740- 30:58.740* :  So tune here, who is my physical therapist and who's my angel.
*31:00.880- 31:02.900* :  Later that year, she performed in public
*31:02.900- 31:05.060* :  for the first time since her aneurysm,
*31:05.400- 31:08.240* :  as a surprise guest at the Newport Folk Festival.
*31:08.460- 31:12.380* :  I could drink a case of you.
*31:12.720- 31:15.120* :  And a live album of that concert is nominated
*31:15.120- 31:17.500* :  for best full-carbum at the Grammys,
*31:17.500- 31:20.000* :  so she could win again as well as play.
*31:20.720- 31:22.280* :  Although one interesting point of note,
*31:22.760- 31:25.740* :  Joni Mitchell isn't the oldest person in that category.
*31:26.240- 31:28.960* :  She's up against Paul Simon, who's 82.
*31:32.840- 31:34.800* :  And that was Colin Patterson reporting.
*31:37.600- 31:39.740* :  That is all from us for now, but the Global News podcast
