*01:41.940- 01:45.400* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Wednesday the 10th of January,
*01:45.400- 01:46.600* :  these are our main stories.
*01:47.320- 01:52.460* :  Armed men who stormed a live TV program in Ecuador have reportedly been captured.
*01:53.120- 01:57.820* :  A court in Washington has heard legal arguments on whether Donald Trump has immunity
*01:57.820- 01:59.860* :  from charges of election fraud.
*02:00.660- 02:04.880* :  Police in Poland have detained a former interior minister and his deputy
*02:04.880- 02:08.160* :  who'd been seeking shelter in the presidential palace.
*02:18.100- 02:18.180* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:19.200- 02:25.160* :  one of the greats of Indian classical music Rashid Khan has died at the age of 55.
*02:29.460- 02:30.620* :  We begin in Ecuador,
*02:35.720- 02:41.800* :  where gunmen wearing hoods stormed onto a live TV set on Tuesday and threatened staff.
*02:42.480- 02:46.800* :  They were forced to line the floor before the live television feed was abruptly cut.
*02:47.580- 02:49.980* :  A short time later, police entered the studio.
*02:50.520- 02:52.880* :  They now say they've contained the situation.
*02:53.620- 02:59.140* :  This all happened today after the Ecuadorian president declared a nationwide state of emergency.
*02:59.340- 03:03.980* :  This was in response to the prison escape of a gang leader on Sunday
*03:03.980- 03:09.180* :  and a spate of riots in Ecuadorian jails which erupted soon after.
*03:10.100- 03:12.440* :  I asked our America's regional editor, Leonardo Russia,
*03:12.440- 03:15.940* :  if all the gunmen at the TV station had now been arrested.
*03:16.660- 03:20.080* :  That's what the police said and they have released pictures and videos.
*03:20.440- 03:23.080* :  They were arrested in Guayaquil, the city of Guayaquil,
*03:23.340- 03:27.200* :  and there are 13 gang members, some of them quite young.
*03:27.240- 03:33.780* :  Police said they also seized with them guns, pistols, bigger weapons, grenades,
*03:33.780- 03:38.320* :  and also several dynamite sticks that they appear on TV.
*03:38.320- 03:43.340* :  At some stage, they put one of those sticks in the breast pocket of the TV presenter.
*03:43.740- 03:47.340* :  What do we know about these gunmen and how this incident relates
*03:47.340- 03:50.100* :  to all the prison rights that we're seeing right now in Ecuador?
*03:50.740- 03:53.820* :  What happened is today there was a day of retaliation
*03:54.400- 03:56.600* :  because of the state of emergency.
*03:56.600- 04:02.000* :  This gang leader escaped on Sunday from a maximum security jail in Guayaquil.
*04:02.340- 04:05.940* :  Then on the day after there was another prison right
*04:05.940- 04:11.100* :  and the president declared a state of emergency for 60 days in an overnight curfew.
*04:11.460- 04:14.300* :  What's clearly happened is that there's several gangs,
*04:14.300- 04:18.080* :  there's about 20 gangs in Ecuador, two of them are the big ones,
*04:18.580- 04:23.080* :  but they attacked police officers, they kidnapped police officers,
*04:23.080- 04:26.380* :  they attacked schools, they robbed shopping centers,
*04:26.820- 04:31.800* :  and they carried out this attack against the TV station, TV station.
*04:32.300- 04:36.600* :  The clear message was that they are not going to accept that.
*04:37.060- 04:39.260* :  Have to remember the president of the noboa,
*04:39.300- 04:42.580* :  that the noboa is quite young, he came into power in November,
*04:43.000- 04:46.780* :  promising exactly that to tackle organized crime in the accused,
*04:46.780- 04:51.420* :  previous governments are just doing nothing about it, about the surge in violence.
*04:51.640- 04:54.400* :  But this poses a very challenge for him, doesn't it?
*04:55.240- 04:59.900* :  Yes, this was a shocking day, even by what Ecuador has become
*05:00.380- 05:02.420* :  accustomed to in the past six, seven years.
*05:02.880- 05:04.200* :  This is a huge challenge.
*05:04.620- 05:07.900* :  Some people criticized him saying that when he declared
*05:07.900- 05:12.580* :  his state of emergency, they should know that there would be a retaliation,
*05:12.580- 05:15.400* :  they should have asked people to stay at home, but they didn't.
*05:15.400- 05:20.240* :  But the main thing is that the population seems to be behind him and say,
*05:20.240- 05:24.660* :  it's time, there is time to stop and to avoid it becoming a unsolvable problem.
*05:25.660- 05:29.640* :  Leonardo Russia, a landmark legal case about whether Donald Trump
*05:29.640- 05:33.380* :  should be immune from criminal prosecution has been heard in Washington.
*05:33.920- 05:36.800* :  Mr. Trump is arguing that he has presidential immunity
*05:36.800- 05:41.600* :  from criminal charges of conspiring to overthrow the 2020 election.
*05:41.740- 05:47.420* :  Speaking after the hearing, he said finding against him would open a Pandora's box
*05:47.420- 05:49.460* :  and unleash Bedlam.
*05:50.160- 05:52.460* :  But as our North America editor, Sarah Smith reports,
*05:53.120- 05:56.440* :  judges questioned whether such immunity would allow a president
*05:56.440- 05:59.060* :  to assassinate a political rival.
*05:59.700- 06:02.560* :  Lawyers for Donald Trump argued in court that the Constitution
*06:02.560- 06:06.480* :  protects former presidents from prosecution for actions taken in office.
*06:07.120- 06:11.420* :  So does that mean an American president could order the murder of a political rival
*06:11.840- 06:13.460* :  and avoid a criminal prosecution?
*06:14.200- 06:18.920* :  Yes, according to Donald Trump's lawyer, who claimed that hypothetically former presidents
*06:18.920- 06:23.380* :  cannot be prosecuted unless they've already been impeached and convicted in Congress.
*06:24.180- 06:29.280* :  The three judges hearing this case sounded skeptical about Mr. Trump's claims to total immunity.
*06:30.040- 06:33.740* :  The prosecution argued that his attempts to interfere with the election results
*06:33.740- 06:38.000* :  were not official presidential acts and so not protected by the Constitution
*06:38.580- 06:41.460* :  and described the idea that former presidents could escape prosecution
*06:41.480- 06:44.380* :  for assassinating rivals as a frightening thought.
*06:45.220- 06:47.540* :  Donald Trump spoke outside the court after the hearing.
*06:48.160- 06:50.000* :  A president has to have immunity.
*06:50.860- 06:53.560* :  And the other thing is I did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong.
*06:54.180- 06:56.780* :  Mr. Trump chose to appear in person today.
*06:56.780- 06:58.440* :  He did not need to be in court.
*06:58.980- 07:02.460* :  But he's made his efforts to fight his various criminal prosecution central
*07:02.460- 07:04.780* :  to his political campaign for re-election.
*07:05.400- 07:09.500* :  Whatever the ruling from this case, it will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court
*07:09.500- 07:13.900* :  to make a definitive decision about whether or not Mr. Trump has immunity.
*07:14.920- 07:19.620* :  Sarah Smith, the U.S. Secretary of State has said Palestinians in northern Gaza
*07:19.960- 07:25.420* :  must be allowed to return home as soon as conditions allow now that fighting there has eased.
*07:26.020- 07:30.680* :  Speaking in Tel Aviv, Anthony Blinken insisted that although Israel had Washington's
*07:30.680- 07:35.540* :  resolute backing, civilian deaths in Gaza were far too high.
*07:36.320- 07:39.300* :  He also said all the countries he visited on his Middle East tour
*07:39.300- 07:44.220* :  saw the creation of an independent Palestinian state as vital for long-term peace.
*07:45.000- 07:48.000* :  But he wouldn't be drawn on whether Israel backs this.
*07:48.420- 07:50.380* :  Where a day is to reports from Jerusalem.
*07:51.080- 07:54.540* :  After a meeting with the entire Israeli war cabinet in Tel Aviv,
*07:54.860- 07:59.720* :  the statement from the American side so that Anthony Blinken had reaffirmed U.S. support
*07:59.720- 08:04.300* :  for Israel's right to prevent a repetition of the October 7th attacks.
*08:04.340- 08:10.200* :  When heavily armed Hamas gunmen broke through the Gaza fence and killed 1200 people in Israel.
*08:10.920- 08:13.600* :  But in separate meetings with the succession of Israeli leaders,
*08:13.980- 08:19.300* :  Mr. Blinken also emphasized what was described as the urgent need to protect civilian lives
*08:19.880- 08:23.000* :  and accelerate the delivery of aid to Palestinians in Gaza.
*08:23.760- 08:28.080* :  More than 100 people are reported to have been killed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza
*08:28.080- 08:31.500* :  over the last day, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
*08:31.960- 08:35.180* :  That brings the total number of victims to more than 23,000.
*08:35.180- 08:40.480* :  And Mr. Blinken has had plenty of growing anger on this mammoth tour from regional leaders
*08:40.960- 08:43.840* :  over the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.
*08:44.380- 08:46.840* :  In today's meetings, I was also crystal clear.
*08:47.440- 08:51.040* :  Palestinians, civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow.
*08:51.740- 08:54.320* :  They must not be pressed to leave Gaza.
*08:54.980- 08:59.120* :  As I told the Prime Minister, the United States unequivocally rejects any proposals
*08:59.700- 09:02.480* :  advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza.
*09:02.960- 09:07.440* :  And the Prime Minister reaffirmed to me today that this is not the policy of Israel's government.
*09:08.180- 09:14.500* :  Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK Khaled bin Bandar al-Saud says his country wants world leaders
*09:14.860- 09:18.140* :  to treat Israel the same way they treat everyone else.
*09:18.440- 09:20.780* :  If anyone else had done what the Israelis are doing today,
*09:21.160- 09:23.980* :  you would have seen them cut off from the international community.
*09:24.040- 09:26.000* :  You would have seen people talking about sanctions.
*09:26.000- 09:28.000* :  You would have seen all sorts of things.
*09:28.660- 09:30.360* :  I just don't see that fair behavior.
*09:30.360- 09:35.780* :  And the blind spot towards Israel is a real problem because it provides a blind spot to the peace.
*09:36.140- 09:40.800* :  And like a lot of things that are linked, we will find no justice for the Palestinians
*09:40.800- 09:43.020* :  if we don't find justice with the Israelis.
*09:43.540- 09:47.520* :  Despite that grain criticism and Washington's concern over the possibility
*09:48.060- 09:51.960* :  of an expanding regional conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon,
*09:52.580- 09:55.960* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains insistent
*09:55.960- 10:01.760* :  that his army's operation in Gaza will not end until all of Israel's war goals are met.
*10:02.560- 10:03.300* :  We're a Davies.
*10:03.480- 10:05.520* :  Well, even as the conflict in Gaza continues,
*10:05.520- 10:09.920* :  one couple there have refused to let the war stop them getting married.
*10:09.920- 10:11.420* :  And a bit more reports.
*10:12.240- 10:16.320* :  Majid and Sarah got engaged a year ago and were due to get married in November,
*10:16.320- 10:20.380* :  but the day before the ceremony, a shell destroyed their newly renovated flat
*10:20.380- 10:22.460* :  in the neighborhood of Sheikh Ezzaldin.
*10:24.120- 10:29.220* :  I had everything for my apartment, a TV, a washing machine, a sofa set, carpets and curtains,
*10:29.680- 10:31.100* :  as well as a fully equipped kitchen.
*10:31.620- 10:35.160* :  It was completely destroyed and we were picked up from under the rubble.
*10:36.720- 10:40.700* :  By God, I can't forget how much time I spent preparing everything from my wedding.
*10:41.440- 10:44.980* :  I was going every day to the market to choose the items I needed from my house.
*10:45.780- 10:48.420* :  I never expected that all of it would go with the wind.
*10:49.640- 10:52.940* :  After the bombing, they fled with Sarah's family to a shelter at a school
*10:52.940- 10:55.060* :  in the central region of the Gaza Strip.
*10:55.320- 10:58.460* :  They are among 1.9 million garsens who have become displaced
*10:58.460- 11:01.100* :  since the start of the war on the 7th of October.
*11:01.100- 11:05.660* :  The United Nations estimates that to be 85% of the total population.
*11:06.280- 11:09.480* :  Majid says he's lost more than 50 members of his family in the war,
*11:09.480- 11:11.700* :  but he was determined to marry Sarah.
*11:12.760- 11:15.740* :  We celebrated in the school, of course, without drums.
*11:16.460- 11:20.680* :  Sarah was wearing a black prayer dress and I wore black trousers and a black shirt.
*11:23.560- 11:26.540* :  Majid convinces father to officiate the ceremony.
*11:28.120- 11:32.860* :  They were determined to get married and told me the living is more important than the dead.
*11:33.360- 11:34.140* :  Let's cheer up.
*11:35.120- 11:38.220* :  I set an example for every father and mother to have trust in God
*11:38.760- 11:40.280* :  and hasten the wedding of their sons.
*11:41.800- 11:42.720* :  Erbignal reporting.
*11:43.400- 11:46.780* :  Polish police have arrested a former interior minister and his deputy
*11:46.780- 11:49.440* :  who'd taken refuge in the presidential palace.
*11:50.300- 11:54.420* :  Mariusch Kaminsky and Maché Wasik were sentenced to prison last month
*11:54.420- 11:58.600* :  as part of a long-running case in which they were found guilty of abuse of power.
*11:59.180- 12:03.000* :  The pair had served in the law and justice led government the lost power in October.
*12:03.760- 12:08.700* :  Poland's president, Angé Duda, an ally of the party had pardoned men,
*12:08.940- 12:12.220* :  but now a court has ruled that pardon was invalid.
*12:12.820- 12:16.380* :  Our correspondent in Warsaw, Adam Eastern, told us why these men
*12:16.380- 12:18.380* :  had sought refuge in the presidential palace.
*12:19.140- 12:21.460* :  They were invited there by President Duda,
*12:21.680- 12:26.600* :  who is a former member of the Law and Justice party and remains an ally
*12:27.260- 12:29.560* :  of the Law and Justice party who are now in opposition,
*12:29.640- 12:35.160* :  but of course, who were in office for eight years before they were voted out
*12:35.160- 12:36.680* :  in October's election.
*12:37.480- 12:41.640* :  Now, President Duda invited them to the presidential palace
*12:41.700- 12:45.960* :  to observe a swearing in ceremony of their former colleagues
*12:46.620- 12:48.700* :  who were becoming advisors to the president.
*12:49.160- 12:54.640* :  He did so after he knew that a court in Warsaw had ordered the police
*12:55.580- 12:58.460* :  to detain these men so that they could start
*12:59.500- 13:03.680* :  serving a two-year prison sentence for abusing their power
*13:04.200- 13:06.060* :  during an anti-corruption investigation.
*13:06.260- 13:12.020* :  So President Duda has invited these men to the presidential palace
*13:12.840- 13:15.960* :  and in effect, help them evade detention.
*13:16.460- 13:20.020* :  And it's not the first time that the president has done such a controversial thing
*13:20.020- 13:22.700* :  because one of these men was an interior minister
*13:22.700- 13:26.880* :  after President Duda granted him a pardon in 2015.
*13:27.760- 13:32.220* :  Yeah, the dispute is essentially that President Duda and these men say,
*13:32.220- 13:36.080* :  President said, I pardoned them for these crimes in 2015.
*13:36.880- 13:41.460* :  But last year, the Supreme Court in Poland said that the pardon was invalid
*13:42.080- 13:48.020* :  because he had issued it before their appeal had a chance to be heard.
*13:48.680- 13:53.360* :  So that is why a court last month issued a final ruling
*13:53.360- 13:59.160* :  sentencing them to prison and then as we have the events on Monday evening
*13:59.160- 14:03.700* :  with the court then asking the police to execute the detention warrant
*14:03.700- 14:06.500* :  so they could then serve their time in prison.
*14:06.700- 14:13.240* :  Now, President Duda and both men say, well, no, my initial pardon in 2015
*14:13.240- 14:18.180* :  overrides or nullifies any court ruling because it is still valid
*14:18.180- 14:20.100* :  and that is the nub of the dispute.
*14:20.760- 14:24.740* :  And that is why these men in these absolutely unprecedented
*14:25.100- 14:30.040* :  circumstances in politics, the saga between the two rival camps now in
*14:30.040- 14:35.100* :  Polish politics, between Polish President Duda and the new pro EU
*14:35.100- 14:39.840* :  coalition government under Donald Tusk has escalated to
*14:40.520- 14:45.060* :  unforeseen levels here with this event and allowed
*14:45.900- 14:49.620* :  these two men to go to the presidential palace and then come out
*14:49.940- 14:55.700* :  and talk to reporters and say, look, we are political prisoners if we are
*14:55.700- 14:59.720* :  imprisoned by the police and then they went back into the palace and then
*14:59.900- 15:04.220* :  several hours later they were actually detained by the police and are now in
*15:04.220- 15:10.160* :  detention. Adam Eason, it's one of the biggest spying scandals to engulf
*15:10.160- 15:15.300* :  longtime enemies Cuba and the United States. A former US ambassador to
*15:15.300- 15:19.500* :  Bolivia was arrested in an FBI sting operation in Miami last month
*15:19.920- 15:22.900* :  for acting as a Cuban spy for more than 40 years.
*15:23.600- 15:27.940* :  Manuel Rocher was secretly recorded by an undercover officer describing the US
*15:27.940- 15:33.260* :  as the enemy, praising Fidel Castro and boasting about his decades long
*15:33.260- 15:37.780* :  double life as a Cuban agent. Over the years, Mr. Rocher would have had access to
*15:37.780- 15:41.320* :  a wealth of classified and sensitive intelligence information.
*15:42.040- 15:45.880* :  The US government is currently trying to assess exactly what material
*15:45.880- 15:50.500* :  he allegedly passed on to his Cuban handlers while at the State Department.
*15:51.240- 15:52.840* :  Will Grant reports from Havana?
*15:56.540- 15:59.580* :  Other than asking the photographers to move out of her way,
*15:59.580- 16:04.300* :  Carla Whitcock Rocher said little to the media where she left court in Miami.
*16:04.460- 16:09.800* :  Inside court, her husband, the former US ambassador to Bolivia, Manuel Rocher,
*16:09.800- 16:14.460* :  had just been charged with working for four decades as a secret agent for Cuba.
*16:15.140- 16:17.320* :  The US Attorney General, Merrick Garland,
*16:17.320- 16:21.980* :  described the case against Mr. Rocher as one of the most significant of its kind.
*16:22.640- 16:28.100* :  This action exposes one of the highest reaching and longest lasting
*16:28.100- 16:32.180* :  infiltrations of the US government by a foreign agent.
*16:35.380- 16:39.720* :  150 kilometers away in Havana, the case of Manuel Rocher has
*16:39.720- 16:45.340* :  gone almost unreported. During his career, Manuel Rocher worked as the number two
*16:45.700- 16:50.240* :  in the building in front of me, the US Embassy in Havana, or, as it was back then,
*16:50.240- 16:56.060* :  the US Interest section. To many observers, it remains extraordinary that Mr. Rocher could have
*16:56.060- 17:00.760* :  risen so high in the US diplomatic service while allegedly working for Cuba.
*17:01.080- 17:05.800* :  Apparently, a brazen example of hiding in plain sight by disguising his true belief
*17:05.800- 17:10.400* :  under a facade of right-wing conservatism. But one man who wasn't entirely surprised
*17:10.400- 17:14.120* :  is James Olson, former chief of country intelligence at the CIA.
*17:14.120- 17:18.280* :  I racked him as probably the most aggravating service I've ever worked against.
*17:18.520- 17:21.800* :  He told me there's a common misconception that Cuba's intelligence services
*17:22.220- 17:26.040* :  were weakened after the fall of the Berlin Wall and when the KGB stepped back.
*17:26.420- 17:31.380* :  Instead of the Cuba's more disciplined and more effective pound for pound,
*17:32.280- 17:40.360* :  than the KGB ever was. They surpassed the KGB in terms of trade craft and motivation and
*17:40.360- 17:46.720* :  resistance to penetration. For its part, Cuba has made no comment about Manuel Rocher, his arrest,
*17:46.720- 17:52.180* :  all the charges that he's facing in Miami. But whenever the subject of spying or spy craft
*17:52.180- 17:57.280* :  is discussed, Cuba's basic position is this, that has been forced to use all the methods at its
*17:57.280- 18:02.860* :  disposal to defend the revolution for more than 60 years of successive U.S. administrations
*18:03.200- 18:06.100* :  hell-bent on forcing the communist-run government from power.
*18:10.000- 18:13.460* :  One of Cuba's most famous spies is a man called Herabdo Hernandez.
*18:14.200- 18:19.200* :  Leader of a group known as the Cuban Five, the men infiltrated anti-castro-cuban-american
*18:19.200- 18:26.240* :  organizations in Florida in the 1990s. He was arrested in 1998 on conspiracy to commit espionage
*18:26.240- 18:31.880* :  charges and spent 16 years in prison before being released as part of a prisoner swap during the
*18:31.880- 18:38.380* :  Obama era thought with Havana. In an exclusive interview, Herabdo Hernandez told me he considers his
*18:38.380- 18:43.900* :  covert operations in the U.S. to be a crucial part of the defense of the Cuban revolution.
*18:44.300- 18:50.680* :  U.S., a country that has a list of alleged countries that sponsor terrorism and they have
*18:51.200- 18:56.660* :  Cuba on that list, paradoxically, they are the one that have their theories and their territory
*18:57.220- 19:04.160* :  operating against Cuba. So, Cuba had no choice but to seek for the kind of information to protect
*19:04.160- 19:09.040* :  our country. Is it going on now? The same work kind of work that you did. Are there people doing
*19:09.040- 19:13.840* :  that work now around the world and in the United States? Well, you know, I've retired a
*19:13.840- 19:20.240* :  long time ago, I couldn't tell for sure, but all I can say is if right now there are still people
*19:20.240- 19:26.580* :  plotting to do terrorism against Cuba. Most broadly, there are going to be Cuban patriots seeking
*19:26.580- 19:33.260* :  for information to protect our country. For former CIA chief James Olson, it still bothers him that,
*19:33.260- 19:38.760* :  by his own admission, Cuba's intelligence services got the better of him. They own this,
*19:39.420- 19:44.700* :  they beat us. And that's one of the reasons I had this personal grudge against the Cuban
*19:44.700- 19:50.320* :  intelligence service because they have been so successful in operating against us.
*19:50.880- 19:56.780* :  You've finally admit they won that battle, as it were. No question about it. I don't like
*19:56.780- 20:02.880* :  the lose to a foreign intelligence service, but they did it. They're good, really good.
*20:04.920- 20:10.520* :  For now Manuel Rocha is yet to enter a plea. The trial in Miami is set to continue soon and will
*20:10.520- 20:15.400* :  be one of the most keenly followed espionage cases in the long history of spying between Washington
*20:15.400- 20:26.760* :  and Havana. That report by Will Grant in Cuba. Still to come? It's Friday night and I'm in the
*20:26.760- 20:32.160* :  red light district in Amsterdam. Surrounded me at dozens of sex workers posing behind windows and
*20:32.160- 20:38.480* :  illuminated by red neon lights. Now there are plans to relocate the prostitutes from the Dutch
*20:38.480- 20:49.460* :  city's famous area to an out of town mega brothel. Some people play golf on the weekends.
*20:49.460- 20:56.280* :  I hunt con artists. Unmissable podcasts from the BBC World Service. Our county mayo or great team

*22:29.420- 22:33.360* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. As we heard in an earlier edition,
*22:33.360- 22:38.960* :  European Union climate monitors say last year was the hottest on record. In fact,
*22:39.020- 22:45.680* :  probably the hottest in the last 100,000 years. The Copernicus Climate Change Service report
*22:45.680- 22:51.940* :  said heatwaves, droughts and wildfires had intensified across the planet as global temperatures
*22:51.940- 23:00.600* :  in 2023 came close to crossing the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
*23:00.600- 23:06.640* :  levels. Last year's or wildfires across Canada severe droughts in East Africa and the Middle
*23:06.640- 23:11.500* :  East. In Europe, the United States and China, there were unprecedented summer heatwaves
*23:11.880- 23:18.360* :  and Australia and South America saw their warmest ever winters. Global warming is making all these
*23:18.360- 23:23.920* :  phenomena more likely posing a challenge for governments everywhere. Our new wells has this
*23:23.920- 23:29.400* :  assessment from Sao Paulo in Brazil. Last year Brazil saw its highest ever temperature,
*23:29.400- 23:35.840* :  44.8 degrees Celsius, and the staggering heatwaves had a significant impact on people's health
*23:35.840- 23:40.500* :  and the environment. A severe drought in the Amazon led to fish and animal carcasses
*23:40.500- 23:45.880* :  washing up on the river banks. A fan died of heat exhaustion after passing out at a Taylor Swift
*23:45.880- 23:52.580* :  concert in Rio. Unlike his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, President Lula is reducing deforestation
*23:52.580- 23:57.920* :  and introducing more ambitious climate targets. He hosted a summit of mostly left-wing
*23:57.920- 24:03.160* :  rainforest nations in August to discuss ways of addressing the crisis and protecting the region
*24:03.160- 24:08.880* :  often referred to as the lungs of the world. But Lula is also under pressure to deliver economic
*24:08.880- 24:13.680* :  growth and has been criticised for backing new oil drilling in the Amazon. Trying to strike
*24:13.680- 24:18.620* :  this balance is a challenge also facing leaders in parts of Africa as my colleague in Kenya and
*24:18.620- 24:24.560* :  Soy explains. Here in the home of Africa, five consecutive seasons of failed rains caused
*24:24.560- 24:30.460* :  prolonged drought, which left at least 50 million people across the region hungry. Harder
*24:30.460- 24:35.680* :  communities lost livestock, their main source of livelihood. But when the rains finally came,
*24:35.680- 24:40.740* :  they caused more devastation in the same region. Hundreds of people died in floods,
*24:40.780- 24:46.160* :  farmlands and towns were submerged and infrastructure like bridges and roads destroyed.
*24:47.060- 24:52.740* :  Major economic setbacks to an already fragile region. African nations are said to be among the
*24:52.740- 24:58.560* :  most vulnerable to the effects of climate change despite contributing least to it. Over
*24:58.560- 25:05.040* :  now to my colleague Laura Bicca in Beijing. China's big problem is coal. The country has more
*25:05.040- 25:10.960* :  coal-fired power stations than anywhere else in the world. And it's still investing in fossil fuels.
*25:11.680- 25:16.420* :  This addiction to coal means China accounts for around a third of the world's greenhouse gas
*25:16.420- 25:21.300* :  emissions each year. But as well as being one of the world's biggest polluters,
*25:21.680- 25:25.780* :  China is also the front runner when it comes to offering the world climate solutions.
*25:25.820- 25:30.960* :  It's building more solar panels and wind turbines than the rest of the world combined.
*25:31.800- 25:36.260* :  China now controls more than 80 percent of the world's solar panel manufacturing.
*25:36.380- 25:43.940* :  This push towards renewables is plugging energy gaps in parts of rural China and CO2 emissions
*25:43.940- 25:49.840* :  are set to fall this year. Laura Bicca and before her we heard from Anne,
*25:49.840- 25:55.320* :  Saway and Ioni Wells. So given all these concerns, I asked the BBC's climate editor,
*25:55.320- 26:01.280* :  Justin Rolatt, what governments are doing to try to overt a potential climate disaster?
*26:01.280- 26:06.620* :  It's interesting isn't it? Because obviously I followed the COP28 meeting in Dubai just before
*26:06.620- 26:12.480* :  the new year. And we saw what looked like a breakthrough, countries agreeing for the first time ever
*26:12.480- 26:17.760* :  of the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are the main driver of the emissions
*26:17.760- 26:22.680* :  that are increasing global temperatures. So that is progress. But on another way of looking at it,
*26:22.680- 26:26.680* :  after 28 of these global meetings, it's also a measure of our failure isn't it?
*26:26.880- 26:32.180* :  That after so long, we've only just acknowledged the main driver of climate change needs to be tackled.
*26:32.500- 26:36.660* :  So on the one hand, countries are getting together and saying that we need to tackle this problem
*26:36.860- 26:40.460* :  acknowledging it. And these are countries remember that have dragged their feet in the past,
*26:40.460- 26:46.000* :  countries like Saudi Arabia, like Russia, India, all these countries have been very reluctant to
*26:46.000- 26:51.180* :  make any commitment. So look at it is good. But at the same time, we absolutely are not doing enough.
*26:51.740- 26:56.060* :  I mean, there has been huge investment in renewables, particularly in China, for instance.
*26:56.080- 27:02.840* :  But if we don't do enough, what does this mean for the future of our children and our grandchildren?
*27:02.840- 27:07.920* :  That is not a question that it's pleasant to answer. When you put carbon upside in the atmosphere,
*27:07.920- 27:13.320* :  it stays there for hundreds, sometimes for thousands of years. It's a stock. It's not a flow.
*27:13.320- 27:17.660* :  It doesn't come out easily. So we're building it. It's like we're increasing the blanket around
*27:17.660- 27:22.940* :  the earth that creates this greenhouse effect. So we will drive up temperatures. It's quite hard
*27:22.940- 27:28.560* :  once you put the gas in there to take it out again. So probably permanently and it won't stop rising
*27:28.560- 27:33.520* :  until we stop increasing emissions. So what does that mean for the future? Well, until we stop
*27:33.520- 27:38.200* :  emitting carbon upside and other greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise.
*27:38.460- 27:42.900* :  And we're already seeing the impact on we around the world. The heat waves that we saw last year,
*27:42.900- 27:47.660* :  the extreme storms that we've seen. All of these things are consequences of climate change.
*27:47.660- 27:51.880* :  They're actually happening more dramatically even than climate scientists expected. So we should
*27:51.880- 27:56.900* :  expect more of those. What impact will that have? What it makes life a bit harder, particularly in
*27:56.900- 28:01.540* :  areas where, for example, agriculture is quite marginal already. It makes it a little bit harder,
*28:01.840- 28:05.580* :  makes people more likely to want to maybe move somewhere else in the world. So we can expect an
*28:05.580- 28:10.620* :  increase in migration. We can expect countries to experience more food insecurity, more water
*28:11.280- 28:15.180* :  insecurity. All of things, which actually when you think about it, make it harder for them to make
*28:15.560- 28:20.520* :  bold kind of inter-governmental decisions about tackling something like climate change. So it is
*28:20.520- 28:24.960* :  worrying and it means we're not going to all die out suddenly, but it means life could be a little
*28:24.960- 28:30.560* :  bit harder for the generations to come. Justin Rolatt, well, despite all these fears for the future,
*28:30.560- 28:36.040* :  Norway has become the first country in the world to open up part of its seabed for mining,
*28:36.040- 28:41.480* :  despite warnings of the possible environmental impact. The government approved a bill which
*28:41.480- 28:48.000* :  will allow companies to apply to extract precious minerals from the seabed. Molly Perella reports.
*28:48.820- 28:52.620* :  The materials are key for producing green technologies, including batteries,
*28:52.620- 28:57.820* :  but environmentalists say mining them from the seafloor could have a catastrophic impact on marine
*28:57.820- 29:02.900* :  life in the area and contribute to climate change. Despite that, Norway's Parliament approved
*29:02.900- 29:08.740* :  the bill with 80 votes in favour and 20 against. The plan will see a large area of Norwegian waters
*29:08.740- 29:14.260* :  bigger than the UK opened up for mining, but Norway says it won't issue any licenses until
*29:14.260- 29:19.160* :  further environmental studies are carried out. There is currently no timetable for when the project
*29:19.160- 29:24.500* :  could begin. Molly Perella, now let's go to the Netherlands where there are plans to relocate
*29:24.500- 29:29.520* :  prostitutes from Amsterdam's famous red light district, away from the city centre to an
*29:29.520- 29:34.260* :  out of town mega brothel, but there have been objections from people who think the red light
*29:34.260- 29:39.540* :  district is an important tourist attraction. City councillors will now debate the new site.
*29:39.540- 29:44.500* :  If approved, it would take seven years to build, as Suzanne Ben reports.
*29:46.460- 29:50.720* :  It's Friday night and I'm in the red light district in Amsterdam, where amongst the canals
*29:50.720- 29:55.840* :  and cobblestreet and wonky buildings, surrounded me are dozens of sex workers posing behind
*29:55.840- 30:02.240* :  windows and doors illuminated by red neon lights. However, plans are in place to relocate many of
*30:02.240- 30:07.180* :  the sex workers to a purpose built erotic centre on the outskirts of Amsterdam.
*30:11.900- 30:17.800* :  Mayor Femke Halzema wants to stop the noisy and unruly behaviour a tourist in the red light
*30:17.800- 30:23.340* :  district. David Ruttor lives there and says it can be difficult to live with sometimes.
*30:23.340- 30:29.520* :  I don't mind being in a kind of living beating heart of a city and hearing what's going on.
*30:29.520- 30:34.120* :  I mean, you will have people just screaming for literally no reason in the middle of a night,
*30:34.120- 30:39.820* :  which can be a bit disturbing at times. Mayor Halzema is also concerned about the levels of crime
*30:39.820- 30:44.520* :  and the vulnerability of the women who work there, many of whom she says are foreign,
*30:45.580- 30:50.140* :  but the plan isn't being welcomed by many sex workers, residents and campaigners.
*30:51.120- 30:57.120* :  Mariska Mayor is the founder of the prostitution information centre. A former sex worker herself,
*30:57.180- 31:01.140* :  she says the red light district is an important part of Amsterdam.
*31:01.600- 31:05.780* :  The sex industry, the window brothels and all the red light is really important,
*31:05.900- 31:13.440* :  a really important part of our neighbourhood. You know, I always call the red light district like one
*31:13.440- 31:19.840* :  square kilometre part of Amsterdam in which everything is happening that you can find in life.
*31:20.740- 31:27.280* :  And window prostitution, I can understand for some people it's a difficult thing to understand,
*31:27.520- 31:34.680* :  but it's a very important part of our city culture. She says many sex workers don't want to move
*31:34.680- 31:42.700* :  away. There's a big difference in working in the window on the street and being part of a society,
*31:43.320- 31:50.400* :  a living area which is the red light district and working somewhere indoor. It's darker,
*31:50.400- 31:58.460* :  it has a different atmosphere. When you go outside of the work it will be dark and quiet on
*31:58.460- 32:03.920* :  the street, so I think I would feel very unsafe. There's now a petition against the plan led by
*32:03.920- 32:09.620* :  Theodore van Boeven, co-owner of Condomary, a condom shop in the red light district.
*32:10.480- 32:15.920* :  He says it's not about protecting his business. We have so many different clients and we are not
*32:15.980- 32:22.000* :  depending on the sex workers here. No, we have this neighbourhood here at the red light district.
*32:22.000- 32:27.920* :  It's so interesting, it's so high a low life together. I have to solve the problems that I
*32:27.920- 32:30.640* :  crowd control and anti-self-to-beager.
*32:37.720- 32:42.340* :  As I wonder around the red light district, I ask people who live there what they think of
*32:42.340- 32:49.260* :  the city's plans to re-house the area's sex industry. Hi, I'm Saskia. I think it's good in terms of
*32:49.460- 32:57.420* :  tourism and disturbance and rubbish, but in terms of working and employment for the people
*32:57.420- 33:02.420* :  actually working here, I don't think it's a good move. My name is Sharon Hewitt, it's not my idea
*33:02.420- 33:08.240* :  of doing that and it's definitely the charm and excitement of this part of town. I don't think
*33:08.240- 33:16.380* :  that that solves the problem, absolutely not. It should be solved by more police in the street to
*33:16.380- 33:22.780* :  take care of the people that are going to see them. The final decision on the future location of
*33:22.780- 33:27.420* :  the red light district has expected later this year, but with so much resistance so far,
*33:27.420- 33:35.420* :  it's unlikely to go down without a fight. That was Suzanne Bern reporting from Amsterdam.
*33:36.100- 33:40.900* :  Let's turn to India now and one of the biggest names in Indian classical music,

*33:56.860- 34:02.000* :  This was the signature voice of Indian classical music in the 21st century, a voice that enchanted
*34:02.000- 34:08.820* :  millions and had become in its own way an instantly recognizable brand. Rashid Khan learned his craft
*34:08.820- 34:14.140* :  in the way Hindustani classical music has been passed down the generations for 700 years,
*34:14.700- 34:20.020* :  inheriting the tradition from his grand uncle Nisar Hussein Khan, one of the most prominent names
*34:20.020- 34:26.260* :  of his era. In time Rashid Khan's fame as a classical vocalist far surpassed his teachers,
*34:26.820- 34:33.080* :  his concerts sold out overnight, his recordings sold by the tens of thousands, his popularity and
*34:33.080- 34:38.960* :  stardom rivaled those of screen personalities, no mean feat for a performer brought up in the
*34:38.960- 34:44.600* :  arcane confines of the classical tradition. But for millions of Usad Rashid Khan's fans,
*34:44.600- 34:50.560* :  it was not the stardom that mattered, it was the voice, the sheer enchantment of the deep
*34:50.560- 34:57.700* :  milifluous baritone twisting, turning, dancing for the notes with the audacity and grace of a
*34:57.700- 35:12.720* :  soaring biting flight. Sanjay Das Gupta, reporting on the life of the
*35:12.720- 35:18.620* :  celebrated music maestro Rashid Khan, who has died at the age of 55.
