*00:37.740- 00:38.320* :  No one.
*00:38.760- 00:39.060* :  Nothing.

*01:08.900- 01:12.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:14.860- 01:19.600* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 1st of January,
*01:19.600- 01:23.560* :  these are our main stories, a powerful earthquake strikes Japan.
*01:24.860- 01:30.080* :  In areas where the shaking was strong, there's an increased risk of house collapses and landslides.
*01:30.480- 01:33.780* :  So please be careful and do not enter dangerous areas.
*01:34.320- 01:37.560* :  Thousands flee to higher ground after tsunami warnings.
*01:37.580- 01:43.160* :  Israeli military says it's killed a senior Hamas commander in an overnight raid in Gaza
*01:43.680- 01:48.120* :  and a celebrated Nobel Peace Laureate gets six months in prison in Bangladesh.
*01:51.480- 01:54.540* :  Also in this podcast, what if something happens to a man,
*01:54.540- 01:57.040* :  an aggressive man can assault another man?
*01:57.040- 02:02.280* :  That's not good either, violence isn't always gender based or sexualized,
*02:02.420- 02:04.500* :  it can simply be some kind of an idiot.
*02:05.280- 02:10.680* :  Ukrainian railways are bringing in female only compartments, but not everyone is on board.
*02:15.160- 02:20.020* :  We start in Japan, which has been hit by a series of earthquakes in the West Central region.
*02:25.960- 02:28.360* :  Building shook and people reacted in panic.
*02:28.360- 02:33.440* :  The authorities issued tsunami warnings and told people in affected areas to move to shelters
*02:33.900- 02:37.100* :  or to higher ground and warned them to be cautious in the coming days,
*02:37.660- 02:40.080* :  and the effects were felt far from the epicenter.
*02:40.380- 02:43.780* :  Jeffrey Hall is a lecturer at Japan's Kandar University.
*02:43.780- 02:47.880* :  He described how he felt the earthquake hundreds of kilometers away.
*02:48.240- 02:52.800* :  I'm all the way over right now in Yokohama on the other side of Japan's main island,
*02:52.800- 02:58.100* :  but at around 4 p.m., I could feel heavy shaking about two minutes long,
*02:58.500- 03:02.000* :  and I could tell even though it wasn't near me that this was a big earthquake,
*03:02.000- 03:07.340* :  it was the exact same experience I had in Tokyo when the 311 earthquake hit.
*03:07.700- 03:11.500* :  Over 10 years ago, you just feel something is very long and you know that
*03:11.680- 03:14.180* :  this has been a terrible earthquake somewhere, but not close.
*03:14.920- 03:19.200* :  I got the latest from our former Tokyo correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes.
*03:19.720- 03:23.660* :  From the pictures coming out from late this afternoon in local time, we're starting to see
*03:23.660- 03:26.160* :  the extent of the damage, and it is very extensive.
*03:26.640- 03:30.580* :  Major structural damage to major highways, to bridges, to infrastructure.
*03:30.580- 03:36.320* :  There have been landslides, many older buildings in the Ishikawa-in-the-Noto Peninsula area appear
*03:36.320- 03:41.260* :  to have come down. People are reportedly still trapped underneath the collapse buildings.
*03:41.260- 03:45.140* :  We're getting reports of many people being brought into local hospitals injured.
*03:45.640- 03:50.280* :  So this is a very, very large earthquake. The biggest I have seen with the largest shaking,
*03:50.280- 03:54.340* :  certainly since that enormous quake hit Japan back in 2011.
*03:54.340- 03:59.100* :  So this is a very serious disaster, and I think it won't be until daybreak tomorrow
*03:59.100- 04:04.100* :  that we really get start to see the full extent of the damage that has been done up
*04:04.220- 04:05.960* :  on the northwest coast there of Japan.
*04:06.340- 04:10.060* :  And we're hearing that the authorities have downgraded warnings of tsunamis,
*04:10.060- 04:13.240* :  but there was a worry about big waves earlier, wasn't there?
*04:14.200- 04:18.340* :  There was a real worry. They were warning that the whole of that coast could have come under a
*04:18.340- 04:23.360* :  five-metre tsunami in the immediate afternoon after the quake, and of course that again brought
*04:23.360- 04:30.080* :  back memories of 2011 when a 15-metre tsunami hit the northeast coast of Japan and did massive
*04:30.080- 04:34.700* :  destruction. That is still part of the collective memory and the collective trauma in Japan,
*04:34.700- 04:38.900* :  what happened back in 2011. So people will have seen those warnings and thought,
*04:39.340- 04:43.020* :  this is it again, and people will have moved to higher ground. They will have fled their homes
*04:43.020- 04:48.040* :  and got out away from the coast as soon as they could. That warning has now been lifted,
*04:48.060- 04:51.960* :  although it still remains in effect for parts of Korea and the far east of Russia,
*04:52.500- 04:56.420* :  but there will be huge relief in Japan that that tsunami has not come to pass.
*04:56.940- 05:02.520* :  Are you mentioned this massive earthquake in March 2011? No doubt lots of lessons were learnt
*05:02.580- 05:08.620* :  about emergency planning after that earthquake. Lots of lessons were learned. A lot of
*05:08.620- 05:13.580* :  infrastructure was reinforced, particularly power plants. There was new tsunami walls built
*05:14.200- 05:18.220* :  along the northeast coast, but of course this is the different coast, and this is a coast which
*05:18.220- 05:23.000* :  experiences far fewer earthquakes than the east coast of Japan, which is on the so-called
*05:23.000- 05:27.520* :  Pacific Rim of Fire by the deep trench that divides Asia from the Pacific Plate.
*05:28.060- 05:32.340* :  So actually the not-op Peninsula is not well known for having lots of large earthquakes,
*05:32.340- 05:37.160* :  and so I think the buildings there were probably less well-prepared and less strengthened than
*05:37.160- 05:41.460* :  they would have been in Tokyo or along the east coast of Japan, which has frequent earthquakes
*05:41.460- 05:48.020* :  and where the construction standards are very high. Rupert Wingville Hayes. The Israeli Defence Force
*05:48.020- 05:53.200* :  says it has killed a senior Hamas commander, believed to be behind one of the attacks on Southern
*05:53.200- 05:59.920* :  Israel on the 7th of October. Adil Masama led the Nukba Hamas Force, which attacked the Kassou
*05:59.920- 06:07.080* :  Fim Kibbutz. The IDF report came as Israeli forces continued their assault on Gaza. Hamas though
*06:07.080- 06:12.960* :  is still fighting. Its released videos showing dozens of rockets it launched from Gaza towards Israel
*06:12.960- 06:19.180* :  overnight, setting off air-raid sirens in Southern and Central Israel. I asked our correspondent in
*06:19.180- 06:25.620* :  Jerusalem, Yolanda Nell, to tell me a little more about Adil Masama, and what the IDF has had to say.
*06:26.140- 06:32.620* :  According to the Israeli military, he was a locally important Hamas commander in Dirabbalah in
*06:32.620- 06:38.600* :  the center of the Gaza Strip, who led one of the groups from this elite Nukba Force that carried
*06:39.340- 06:45.280* :  one of the attacks on the 7th of October, and they say he also directed some Hamas fighters to go
*06:45.280- 06:51.600* :  to other communities that are along the border to Beiri and to Nidim. And so then he was back in
*06:51.600- 06:55.840* :  Gaza continuing to lead fighting against Israeli soldiers. We've had quite a number of these
*06:55.840- 07:01.160* :  announcements over the past few weeks where they say they have managed to track down some of those
*07:01.160- 07:07.020* :  that were directly involved in those deadly attacks of the 7th of October. And what has been
*07:07.020- 07:12.600* :  happening in Gaza overnight? Well, I mean, just after the stroke of midnight, I should in the new
*07:12.600- 07:17.940* :  year, there was a barrage of close to 30 rockets fired from Gaza aimed at Southern and Central
*07:17.940- 07:23.240* :  Israel. So you can see footage of that with the interceptions of some of those by Israeli air
*07:23.240- 07:28.640* :  defense systems. No one was reported to have been heard. Meanwhile, I mean, in Gaza itself, there
*07:28.640- 07:33.600* :  was intense bombardment by Israel, and a journalist who worked with us in Hain Unis, which is of course
*07:33.600- 07:37.760* :  the focus of Israel's southern offensive, where Hamas leaders are believed to be hiding,
*07:37.760- 07:43.520* :  told us that 25 people had been killed, many injured in air strikes. He'd seen that the injured
*07:43.520- 07:48.860* :  coming into the hospital, otherwise still very intense fighting going on in the center of Gaza
*07:48.860- 07:53.900* :  and in parts of the north. And what's Israel been saying about how it intends to carry forward
*07:53.900- 07:59.400* :  its military campaign? So we had an Israeli military spokesman saying basically in a kind of
*07:59.400- 08:06.240* :  new year message that the Israeli war would continue throughout 2024 in Gaza, saying that the
*08:06.240- 08:11.500* :  country's ready for prolonged fighting against Hamas, and that it's also doing forward planning,
*08:11.500- 08:17.620* :  and knows that there will be a need for other potentially fighting in the coming months.
*08:17.620- 08:23.780* :  So it's for that reason, bringing home some of the 300,000 army reservists, they're getting a
*08:23.980- 08:30.120* :  from the conflict with Israel, really trying to help its its war hit economy, and there's an
*08:30.120- 08:34.660* :  Israeli official also saying that this is necessary to prepare for a possible widening of the
*08:34.660- 08:38.280* :  conflict with Hezbollah, with the Lebanese armed group up in the north of Israel.
*08:41.480- 08:47.300* :  Accord in Bangladesh has sentenced the Nobel laureate, Mohammed Yunus, to six months in jail
*08:47.300- 08:52.140* :  for violating labor laws. His supporters say the case is politically motivated,
*08:53.160- 08:58.240* :  celebrated around the world for helping millions of people out of poverty. Mr. Yunus is also known
*08:58.240- 09:04.920* :  as banker to the poor, but at home in Bangladesh she has a powerful enemy. He's been a vocal critic
*09:04.920- 09:10.100* :  of the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina. Our reporter in Bangladesh is Akbar Hussein.
*09:10.840- 09:15.680* :  Many people believe that Professor Mohammed Yunus is the victim of conspiracy,
*09:15.680- 09:20.500* :  unleashed by the government, but the government always claims that Professor Mohammed Yunus
*09:20.720- 09:27.360* :  violated the labor law in Bangladesh when he formed a telecom company, and there are some legal
*09:27.360- 09:33.500* :  issues, and that's why some officials and laborers of the previous company that took it to the
*09:34.200- 09:39.420* :  Bangladesh labor court, and after some extensive hearing, the labor court were given
*09:40.560- 09:45.880* :  six months of imprisonment, along with other three officials. Mohammed Yunus formed the
*09:45.880- 09:51.420* :  Grameen Bank, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Tell us a bit more about that bank, and
*09:51.420- 09:57.660* :  about the man himself. Professor Mohammed Yunus, he founded the Grameen Bank in the early
*09:57.660- 10:04.640* :  mid-70s, when he was teaching at the Cheetogong University, and at the same time he founded the Grameen
*10:04.640- 10:09.940* :  Bank. And the idea was that, at that time, 40 years ago, the Bangladesh's economy condition
*10:09.940- 10:16.680* :  was very bad. Professor Yunus brought the idea that the people who are ultra-poor, they should have
*10:16.680- 10:22.200* :  some sort of, you know, rights to the credits from the bank, because the traditional banking system,
*10:22.200- 10:27.460* :  they do not give loans to the poor people. That's why Professor Yunus founded the Grameen Bank.
*10:27.660- 10:32.280* :  That Grameen Bank, it has been giving micro credits to the people, especially the women,
*10:33.000- 10:38.780* :  millions of millions of Bangladesh, especially women. Their economic condition has changed a lot,
*10:39.380- 10:45.100* :  because of the Grameen Bank. Many people believe that it's Bangladesh, that this is some sort of
*10:45.140- 10:49.840* :  personal issues, Prime Minister Shekhasina, she has Professor Mohammed Yunus, because Professor
*10:49.840- 10:56.260* :  Mohammed Yunus is the most celebrated Bangladesh around the world. And, you know, he's quite old now,
*10:56.260- 11:01.980* :  and frail. What effect would the prison sentence have on him? Professor Yunus, now 83-year-old,
*11:02.420- 11:09.040* :  and now, after the Labour Court verdict, he has every opportunity to challenge the verdict,
*11:09.040- 11:14.660* :  and he can go to the high court to challenge the verdict. His lawyers also say that they will appeal
*11:14.660- 11:20.640* :  against the verdict. So, let's see what happens, the legal process, but if he has to go to the jail
*11:20.640- 11:25.480* :  and behind the parts, it will have some sort of negative impact definitely on his health.
*11:25.640- 11:28.120* :  That's a matter of a big concern for his health.
*11:28.880- 11:34.840* :  Akbar Hussein. In Ukraine, President Zelensky has vowed to boost his country's military
*11:34.840- 11:40.680* :  production. In his new year message of resilience, he said, Ukraine had become stronger as the war
*11:40.680- 11:49.080* :  approaches its third year. Our weapons, our equipment, artillery, our shells, our drones,
*11:49.180- 11:55.660* :  our naval greetings to the enemy, and at least a million Ukrainian drones, all of which we will
*11:55.660- 12:02.940* :  generously, used on land in the sky and, of course, at sea. Just hours after the message Russia
*12:02.940- 12:08.580* :  launched more attacks. In recent days, fighting has intensified in several areas across the country.
*12:09.020- 12:13.160* :  The Russian-installed authorities in the eastern city of Donetsk said Ukrainian
*12:13.160- 12:17.880* :  shelling killed four people. Our correspondent in Kiev is James Waterhouse.
*12:18.560- 12:23.340* :  It's a difficult period, I think that's fair to say. If you look at the words of President Zelensky,
*12:23.340- 12:29.620* :  he is now looking inward where he talks about this internal production of the military equipment
*12:29.620- 12:37.840* :  Ukraine needs, not to completely liberate its territories, it still dreams to do, but to simply
*12:37.840- 12:44.400* :  sustain its defense in the face of Russia's continued invasion. We've had a week where there were
*12:44.480- 12:49.560* :  fears going into the new year period that Russia was stoppiling missiles in that it was saving
*12:49.560- 12:55.660* :  them up for a sizable attack. That moment arrived with Russia's biggest ever aerial bombardment
*12:55.720- 13:02.300* :  of Ukrainian cities and there's been a deadly aerial tit for tat synth with Ukraine targeting the
*13:02.300- 13:08.040* :  southwestern Russian region of Pyogorov. Russia responded again. The aerial threat is the greatest
*13:08.040- 13:13.420* :  it's been for some time with its air defenses for once getting overwhelmed in some areas.
*13:13.980- 13:19.220* :  But of course there is this very uncertain look ahead into the new year where the last of
*13:20.020- 13:24.840* :  the US-approved support packages has arrived and Ukraine's ability to replenish its air
*13:24.840- 13:30.440* :  defenses to keep fighting and keep defending itself is far from assured in the long term. It's
*13:30.440- 13:35.960* :  a difficult time. And of course there must be concern in Ukraine that there's general war fatigue
*13:35.960- 13:40.960* :  amongst many of Ukraine's allies. Yes, that's already directly affecting Ukrainian
*13:40.960- 13:46.660* :  frontline operations. Senior US politicians decided to go on their Christmas breaks instead of
*13:46.660- 13:52.340* :  unlock a 50 billion dollar support package. We've had hungry blocker similar offering from
*13:53.180- 13:58.980* :  the European Union and the issue with Ukraine or for Ukraine has been speed. It has either been
*13:58.980- 14:03.200* :  when it launched its counteroffensive in the summer. The liberation came in the form of only
*14:03.200- 14:08.440* :  a few kilometers here and there in settlements reduced to rubble. And Ukraine has also had an
*14:08.440- 14:14.080* :  issue with the speed at which Western support has arrived. It's not a case it's not a problem with
*14:14.080- 14:18.700* :  what has arrived but what Kiev always argues is that they should have had this kind of help
*14:18.700- 14:24.920* :  before the full scale invasion. So it's that lack of speed that has fed skepticism certainly within
*14:24.920- 14:31.320* :  the US Republican Party where you have politicians wanting a quicker return on the billions of dollars
*14:31.320- 14:36.680* :  they've signed off for Ukraine to date. And what's the mood like amongst people in Kiev where you are?
*14:36.900- 14:42.680* :  The overarching emotion is fatigue. I think the weight of this war is deeply felt. People know people
*14:42.680- 14:46.540* :  who are fighting. They know people who have been killed. They're a men who are petrified at getting
*14:46.540- 14:50.980* :  called up and fighting themselves on the front line. And Ukraine's ability to defend itself
*14:51.900- 14:58.000* :  so heavily relies on having that Western support. And if it was to stutter then it could still
*14:58.660- 15:04.640* :  lose this war. Russia could push against what Kiev argues in the long term. It's an extraordinary
*15:05.160- 15:08.580* :  story of survival already but the problem for Kiev is it is not over.
*15:09.360- 15:15.940* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the dangers faced by rail passengers.
*15:16.460- 15:21.660* :  Now the state railway company has introduced women-only compartments on several of its long
*15:21.660- 15:27.180* :  distance sleeper trains. In a move seeking to protect women against assault and make them feel
*15:27.180- 15:30.840* :  more comfortable at a time of war. Vitaly Shifchenko reports.
*15:35.960- 15:43.840* :  Trains have a special place in the Ukrainian soul. They are affordable and reliable. So reliable
*15:43.840- 15:50.220* :  that there are stories of them arriving on time despite Russian shelling. There's a whole culture
*15:50.220- 15:55.680* :  associated with the railway journeys in Ukraine because it's a large country, the largest in
*15:55.680- 16:03.000* :  Europe in fact. Such trips often take a long time and are often overnight in sleeper carriages.
*16:03.700- 16:09.500* :  For generations, Ukrainians have bolstered such journeys with food, boiled eggs, chicken,
*16:09.500- 16:16.340* :  and sometimes alcohol. And historically, trains were often seen as a place for socializing.
*16:16.340- 16:21.800* :  And that's where problems start. Not everyone wants to socialize with fellow passengers
*16:21.800- 16:29.180* :  and some women have become targets of unwanted attention. In 2020, one woman was assaulted
*16:29.180- 16:35.560* :  and nearly raped in a trained compartment. Here she is, barely able to speak shortly after
*16:35.560- 16:46.020* :  the attack. He grabbed me like this and while I was lying down, he kept hating my head with
*16:46.020- 16:51.180* :  his fist. As I struggled, he told me, be a good girl or I'll hurt you more. I shouted,
*16:51.180- 16:54.580* :  but no one came to help even though I parmaled the walls.
*16:56.280- 17:01.840* :  The Ukrainian State Railway Company, Ukrazelis Nita, is aware of the problem. And that is why
*17:01.840- 17:09.340* :  it has introduced women-only compartments on four long-distance services so far. Yvgen Lashchenko
*17:09.340- 17:13.820* :  is the head of the company. Of course, we have several incidents and it's happening
*17:14.620- 17:20.080* :  even before the war. It happens. In the current situation this kind of request is higher
*17:20.080- 17:25.680* :  because the request to fuel security is higher than before the war. In general,
*17:25.680- 17:31.280* :  women are looking for higher comfort because there's not a lot of security. There's also comfort.
*17:31.280- 17:37.120* :  Mr. Lashchenko says a feeling of security is particularly important at a time of war.
*17:37.400- 17:44.580* :  You remember what difficulties and what stress millions of Ukrainians faced during
*17:44.580- 17:53.780* :  evacuation and believe me. For a lot of them, till now, this memory is still fresh.
*17:53.780- 17:59.600* :  And of course, it is also another reason that they are looking for higher security.
*18:00.000- 18:05.120* :  Female passengers have generally welcomed the move. Here is Yaroslavá.
*18:10.860- 18:13.880* :  If it's a reasonable person, I don't care if it's a man or a woman,
*18:14.340- 18:17.620* :  but other women can be uncomfortable around men, whom they don't know.
*18:18.520- 18:23.260* :  I suppose it's possible. I welcome it because I understand that there's a need for it.
*18:24.140- 18:29.180* :  Some women, but not me, have been on the receiving end of unacceptable behavior by man.
*18:29.700- 18:32.560* :  But some, like Victoria, are less convinced.
*18:37.860- 18:43.480* :  What if something happens to a man? An aggressive man can assault another man. That's not good either.
*18:44.160- 18:49.360* :  Violence isn't always gender-based or sexualized. It can simply be some kind of an idiot.
*18:50.020- 18:54.920* :  Ukraine's railways have always been vital in connecting parts of this large country.
*18:55.500- 19:01.020* :  And now, they also offer a lifeline for refugees desperate to escape the war.
*19:01.700- 19:08.300* :  The state railway is keen to make the experience as safe as possible, despite Russian shelling.
*19:13.280- 19:14.600* :  Still to come in the podcast.
*19:22.740- 19:26.840* :  A new year, a new copyright rules for the most famous mass of them all.
*19:31.840- 19:38.680* :  Who would kick off 14 of their best players to defend his racist dignity?
*19:39.180- 19:41.520* :  Unmissible stories from around the globe.
*19:41.520- 19:45.000* :  I get a call from the moral police.
*19:45.000- 19:47.700* :  They told me the general wants to talk to you.
*19:47.860- 19:54.060* :  They asked us to leave the house immediately because it was going to be pumped.
*19:54.520- 19:56.900* :  Podcasts from the BBC World Service.
*19:57.460- 20:01.700* :  Search for amazing sport stories, livesless ordinary, and the documentary,
*20:02.500- 20:04.080* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*20:07.900- 20:09.120* :  They want you to change your name.
*20:09.340- 20:10.540* :  Archie reached off the carpet.
*20:11.000- 20:11.720* :  Anything come to mind?
*20:12.200- 20:12.780* :  Carrie Grant.
*20:13.220- 20:15.160* :  He was Hollywood's greatest leading man.
*20:15.340- 20:17.220* :  But Carrie Grant is a character.
*20:17.260- 20:19.220* :  Everybody careful about how he's perceived.
*20:19.560- 20:21.040* :  Yet few truly knew him.
*20:21.160- 20:23.940* :  I have loved a lot of people and everyone's broken my heart.
*20:24.120- 20:25.660* :  I'll never let you go, aren't you?
*20:25.820- 20:27.900* :  Based on the remarkable true story.
*20:28.100- 20:29.200* :  You know what's wrong with you?
*20:29.500- 20:30.060* :  No one.
*20:30.520- 20:30.800* :  Nothing.
*20:31.080- 20:35.380* :  Jason Isaacs is Archie, the man who became Carrie Grant,
*20:35.740- 20:37.480* :  now streaming only on brickbox.
*20:43.440- 20:49.140* :  2024 is set to be a big year as arguably the world's most important election takes place.
*20:49.140- 20:51.900* :  The American public will be choosing a president.
*20:51.900- 20:55.740* :  But before November's election, a series of contests within the
*20:55.740- 20:59.700* :  Opposition Republican Party will take place, known as primaries,
*20:59.700- 21:03.260* :  to see who will take on the Democrat incumbent Joe Biden.
*21:03.820- 21:07.780* :  That all kicks off in the state of Iowa on January 15th.
*21:08.160- 21:11.080* :  My colleague, Rob Young, got more on this from the BBC's
*21:11.080- 21:14.280* :  Senior North American Reporter, and to his Dirtcher.
*21:15.080- 21:17.180* :  Candidates have won Iowa in the past.
*21:17.180- 21:22.640* :  In fact, Republicans have won Iowa repeatedly in recent history and not gone on
*21:23.160- 21:24.780* :  to win the presidential nomination.
*21:24.900- 21:29.740* :  And the part of the reason is that the electorate in Iowa
*21:30.160- 21:34.520* :  does not necessarily reflect the electorate of the larger United States.
*21:34.520- 21:39.100* :  It's older, it's wider, it's more religious, more conservative.
*21:39.580- 21:43.160* :  The importance of Iowa, however, is that it windows the field.
*21:43.640- 21:47.680* :  While it doesn't necessarily annoy the person who is going to be the ultimate winner,
*21:47.680- 21:54.260* :  it definitely eliminates people who don't make any kind of headway in Iowa.
*21:54.520- 21:56.400* :  There's a saying that there are three tickets out of Iowa.
*21:56.860- 22:01.320* :  The top three finishers tend to make it on to the New Hampshire primary,
*22:01.320- 22:05.240* :  which is next and onto the campaign, the primary campaign going forward.
*22:05.400- 22:06.140* :  There are exceptions.
*22:06.140- 22:10.680* :  Joe Biden did horribly in Iowa for Democrats in 2020,
*22:10.680- 22:12.640* :  and he ended up winning the nomination.
*22:12.640- 22:16.280* :  But particularly for the Republicans, I think that's kind of a good rule of thumb.
*22:16.720- 22:20.080* :  And so by the time it gets to Super Tuesday, at the beginning of March,
*22:20.080- 22:24.760* :  will we know then who the Republican candidate is going to be?
*22:24.760- 22:26.160* :  Or could it be even later than that?
*22:26.800- 22:31.940* :  In this case, looking at what's going on now, we should know by Super Tuesday.
*22:32.600- 22:35.020* :  If you're gaming it out, there are two possible scenarios
*22:35.580- 22:37.480* :  for how the Republican race plays out.
*22:37.480- 22:40.780* :  The first one is the one that the polls are telling us.
*22:41.280- 22:46.920* :  The polls are indicating that Donald Trump has an iron grip on the nomination,
*22:46.920- 22:50.280* :  that he's going to win in Iowa and he's going to win in New Hampshire,
*22:50.500- 22:51.980* :  and he's even going to win in South Carolina,
*22:51.980- 22:55.240* :  which comes later in Nevada before Super Tuesday.
*22:55.720- 22:59.280* :  And if he does that, if there's anyone hanging by their fingernails
*22:59.280- 23:02.900* :  when it gets to Super Tuesday, Super Tuesday will be the knockout punch.
*23:03.400- 23:06.560* :  Now, there's another possibility, and it's definitely much more
*23:06.560- 23:09.400* :  slight and polls don't necessarily bear this out,
*23:09.880- 23:12.520* :  but it's that someone either in all likelihood,
*23:12.520- 23:15.920* :  Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, or Nikki Haley,
*23:16.200- 23:20.060* :  who's a former governor of South Carolina, the former US ambassador to the United Nations,
*23:20.060- 23:23.080* :  under Donald Trump, that they do better than expected.
*23:23.660- 23:26.500* :  That maybe one of them wins the Iowa caucus
*23:26.500- 23:28.200* :  as an upset of Donald Trump.
*23:28.800- 23:32.480* :  And then Nikki Haley goes on, or maybe former New Jersey governor,
*23:32.480- 23:35.100* :  Chris Christie wins in New Hampshire.
*23:35.320- 23:37.040* :  And then all of those things happen,
*23:37.040- 23:39.180* :  or even if they come a close second,
*23:39.760- 23:41.300* :  then this might drag on a little more.
*23:41.880- 23:46.420* :  Anthony Zertcher, the new year has brought the end of most EU visa restrictions
*23:46.460- 23:47.960* :  for people from Kosovo.
*23:48.500- 23:50.960* :  It was the only country in the Western Balkans
*23:50.960- 23:55.200* :  whose citizens did not enjoy visa-free access to EU member states.
*23:55.800- 23:58.220* :  Here's our Balkans correspondent, Guida Lorney.
*23:58.880- 24:02.340* :  The new visa regime probably spells the end of a common sight
*24:02.340- 24:05.520* :  in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the Long Cues,
*24:05.520- 24:09.160* :  which frequently snaked along the roads in front of diplomatic missions.
*24:09.180- 24:14.900* :  The German embassy even took on extra staff to deal with the tens of thousands of visa requests
*24:14.900- 24:16.700* :  they received every year.
*24:17.260- 24:21.720* :  Kosovo actually fulfilled the EU's requirements for visa-free access in 2018.
*24:21.720- 24:26.840* :  But its citizens have endured a frustrating six-year delay to the deal's implementation.
*24:26.840- 24:31.880* :  Brussels bureaucracy and fractious relations with Prime Minister Albin Courty's government
*24:32.240- 24:33.180* :  both played a part.
*24:33.680- 24:35.740* :  But the restrictions won't be lifted entirely.
*24:35.740- 24:39.960* :  Five EU member states still don't recognise Kosovo's independence.
*24:39.980- 24:43.480* :  One of them, Spain, will continue to require visas.
*24:44.200- 24:48.420* :  Guida Lorney, here in Britain, the spiritual head of the Church of England,
*24:48.420- 24:52.760* :  the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has called on political leaders
*24:52.760- 24:55.960* :  contesting elections this year to respect each other.
*24:56.320- 24:59.620* :  Speaking to the BBC, he urged them to disagree passionately,
*24:59.880- 25:01.100* :  but not destructively.
*25:01.460- 25:05.380* :  He was speaking in a televised New Year message, John Donnison reports.
*25:06.380- 25:08.080* :  In the year he crowned a new king.
*25:08.080- 25:12.720* :  Archbishop Justin Welby opens his New Year message on the coronation.
*25:13.660- 25:16.780* :  And at a time when headlines have been dominated by wars,
*25:16.780- 25:21.120* :  much of the Archbishop's message is focused on the world's conflicts,
*25:21.260- 25:22.140* :  first, in Ukraine.
*25:22.140- 25:25.940* :  Wars seem everywhere at the moment.
*25:27.720- 25:28.860* :  Wars we know about, wars forgotten.
*25:29.200- 25:33.720* :  I've seen for myself the ongoing human cost of war.
*25:34.120- 25:37.740* :  In Ukraine I went to Brutcher, where evidence of a trust is,
*25:37.740- 25:39.140* :  was found.
*25:39.640- 25:43.660* :  I've met Ukrainian refugees, most recently in Georgia and Romania.
*25:43.660- 25:46.680* :  Families having to start again in a new country.
*25:46.680- 25:51.700* :  He also touches on the current conflict in the Middle East.
*25:53.140- 25:53.940* :  In Jerusalem last October,
*25:54.280- 25:57.580* :  I sat and listened to some of those traumatized by war.
*26:00.320- 26:02.460* :  Callostinian and Israeli.
*26:02.460- 26:04.540* :  To some of those traumatized by war,
*26:05.300- 26:07.100* :  Palestinian and Israeli.
*26:07.480- 26:10.620* :  In a special interview, the Archbishop urges politicians here
*26:10.620- 26:13.360* :  and in the United States facing an election year,
*26:13.820- 26:17.560* :  not to focus on division and what he called wedge issues.
*26:18.040- 26:22.780* :  We have to say, my opponent is never my enemy.
*26:22.780- 26:25.440* :  My opponent is always my fellow human being.
*26:26.480- 26:27.580* :  We disagree profoundly.
*26:27.580- 26:30.300* :  We disagree on incredibly important things, but they're human.
*26:31.040- 26:33.980* :  We respect each other's dignity, their humanity,
*26:34.720- 26:36.880* :  and the humanity of those who support them.
*26:37.440- 26:40.840* :  And that is a decision by leaders.
*26:42.200- 26:46.300* :  And I hope and pray that in this country,
*26:47.220- 26:49.620* :  they will force where wedge issues.
*26:51.820- 26:55.060* :  Archbishop Wellby ends his new year message to the country
*26:55.060- 26:58.100* :  by wishing everyone a peaceful 2024.
*26:59.360- 27:00.120* :  John Donnerson.
*27:00.880- 27:05.340* :  In 1928, Walt Disney released the first film to feature Mickey Mouse,
*27:05.360- 27:08.320* :  a black and white animation called Steamboat Willie.
*27:08.840- 27:11.360* :  And today, 1 January 2024,
*27:11.360- 27:13.600* :  is the day when under U.S. law,
*27:13.600- 27:16.600* :  the original Mickey Mouse enters the public domain
*27:16.600- 27:18.940* :  and is no longer subject to copyright.
*27:19.560- 27:22.800* :  But Mickey hasn't totally escaped the company's control
*27:23.240- 27:24.520* :  as Vincent Dowd explains.
*27:30.640- 27:33.160* :  Steamboat Willie lasts just 8 minutes,
*27:33.160- 27:37.920* :  but in 1928, it introduced a character soon to be world famous.
*27:38.460- 27:41.260* :  Mickey Mouse sets off on a boat, a longer river,
*27:41.640- 27:44.060* :  picks up a cow, is mocked by a parrot,
*27:44.460- 27:46.740* :  and meets an early version of Minnie Mouse.
*27:47.140- 27:49.200* :  There's no real dialogue, but the voices,
*27:49.560- 27:53.320* :  such as they were, were supplied by the young Walt Disney himself.
*27:56.980- 27:59.980* :  In the U.S., most films are protected under copyright
*27:59.980- 28:02.100* :  for a total of 95 years.
*28:02.540- 28:04.820* :  After that, they enter the public domain.
*28:04.820- 28:09.280* :  They belong to no one and can be exploited commercially by anyone.
*28:09.740- 28:12.740* :  Disney has, for decades, been very influential
*28:13.080- 28:15.120* :  in shaping copyright laws in America,
*28:15.520- 28:18.460* :  which is why Mickey at 95, coming out of copyright,
*28:18.960- 28:20.080* :  is a big change.
*28:20.480- 28:22.440* :  But that's not the entire story.
*28:23.900- 28:28.540* :  Who's the leader of the club that's made for you, Woody?
*28:28.540- 28:28.620* :  Woody!
*28:29.280- 28:29.740* :  Woody!
*28:29.820- 28:32.240* :  Thank you all, and for you, Woody.
*28:32.600- 28:36.200* :  The image of Mickey used on TV in the Mickey Mouse Club
*28:36.200- 28:40.440* :  from the mid-1950s had already altered a lot physically.
*28:40.800- 28:43.180* :  It's only the original 1920s version,
*28:43.500- 28:45.020* :  which is now out of copyright.
*28:45.460- 28:48.040* :  Anyone wanting to test the new legal position
*28:48.460- 28:51.780* :  using a more recent version would be facing the power
*28:51.780- 28:54.040* :  and wealth of an American corporation
*28:54.040- 28:58.980* :  with a long-established interest in the world's best-known mouse.
*29:02.300- 29:03.540* :  Vincent Dowd reporting.
*29:06.500- 29:07.840* :  And that's all from us for now,
*29:07.840- 29:10.940* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:10.940- 29:14.660* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*29:14.880- 29:15.940* :  you can send us an email.
*29:15.940- 29:19.840* :  The address is globalpodcast at BBC.co.uk.

*29:23.440- 29:24.860* :  at Global NewsPod.
*29:25.220- 29:27.620* :  This edition was mixed by Chris Ablaquois
*29:27.940- 29:29.380* :  and the producer was David Lewis.
*29:29.740- 29:31.220* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*29:31.660- 29:32.500* :  I'm Rachel Wright.
*29:32.940- 29:34.300* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*29:42.540- 29:44.760* :  There's something magical about unboxing.
*29:45.500- 29:46.840* :  When you unbox brickbox,
*29:47.200- 29:50.040* :  you uncover a world of British entertainment.
*29:50.420- 29:52.460* :  Stream the UK's most brilliant series,
*29:52.460- 29:55.120* :  including new and upcoming seasons of Shetland,
*29:55.460- 29:57.260* :  Father Brown and Death in Paradise,
*29:57.260- 29:59.540* :  plus new originals like payback,
*29:59.820- 30:00.820* :  Irving Welsh's crime,
