*01:43.720- 01:46.340* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:48.640- 01:52.680* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on the 10th of January these are our main stories.
*01:52.940- 01:58.780* :  People in Ecuador are living under a state of emergency after drug gangs took over a TV station
*01:58.780- 02:03.620* :  and fought gun battles with police and the streets. I hope that this state of emergency yields
*02:03.620- 02:10.000* :  results positive results for the population. On a day-to-day basis when we go out to work we don't
*02:10.000- 02:15.160* :  know if we'll return or if we'll come back home in one piece. And who will run cars after the war
*02:15.160- 02:21.220* :  is over the US Secretary of State has been meeting the man who may hold the key to Palestinian unity.
*02:24.200- 02:29.860* :  Also in this podcast, bribery and match fixing in Chinese football what happened to President
*02:29.860- 02:35.560* :  Xi's dream of dominating the beautiful game. And as Taiwan goes to the polls this weekend there's
*02:35.560- 02:40.780* :  an elephant in the room. And Taiwanese but my ancestors come from China we have the same blood.
*02:41.000- 02:46.740* :  I am definitely Taiwanese but I think there is no way for us to separate from China.
*02:50.020- 02:55.680* :  We begin in Ecuador where at least 10 people have been killed since a state of emergency began on
*02:55.980- 03:01.800* :  Monday after a notorious gangster vanished from his prison cell. Gangs responded by setting
*03:01.800- 03:07.800* :  off car bombs and attacking buildings. On Tuesday, masked gunmen broke into a live television studio
*03:08.200- 03:11.240* :  in the city of Guayakil forcing people to lie on the floor.
*03:11.700- 03:15.480* :  Presenter Jorge Rendon was in the studio when the attack took place.
*03:19.080- 03:23.560* :  They shot one of our cameramen in the leg, broke the arm of another one. They fired bullets,
*03:23.560- 03:28.160* :  they used their weapons inside. The police were alerted and they came in minutes,
*03:28.660- 03:32.960* :  surrounded the TV station and the tactical units into Dean to they fired shots.
*03:34.000- 03:37.540* :  The gunmen were heavily armed, had long-range weapons and wore bad clothes.
*03:38.920- 03:42.800* :  On the streets of the capital, Quito, there's a real sense of fear about what could happen next.
*03:45.340- 03:49.900* :  I hope that this state of emergency yields results, positive results for the population,
*03:49.900- 03:56.520* :  not for the criminals. We live in constant fear because on a day-to-day basis,
*03:56.520- 04:01.000* :  when we go out to work, we don't know if we'll return or if we'll come back home in one piece.
*04:01.880- 04:04.880* :  Well, their concern is understandable. Here's a statement from one of the gangs.
*04:04.940- 04:12.400* :  You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war.
*04:12.620- 04:18.740* :  President Daniel Nabor has now authorized the military to neutralize in his words a number of armed
*04:19.140- 04:25.280* :  groups. I asked Vanessa Bush Schluter, our Latin America online editor, whether that's possible.
*04:25.900- 04:31.140* :  Legally, he can. That's why he issued this decree. This gives the soldiers the force
*04:31.500- 04:38.160* :  or the power to shoot at sight at suspected gang members. However, the question is,
*04:38.160- 04:44.240* :  what will it change in practice? Because, of course, he has also published a list of the 22 gangs
*04:44.240- 04:49.440* :  that he has declared as terrorist gangs, but those gangs were known before.
*04:49.440- 04:56.280* :  So, many people in Ecuador are asking why weren't these measures taken before if these people were
*04:56.280- 05:02.240* :  known and had launched attacks as early as last year, when, of course, you will remember a
*05:02.240- 05:07.760* :  presidential candidate was assassinated by these gangs. And Daniel Nabor came into office
*05:08.040- 05:13.140* :  like last year, his 36-year-old. He came in saying, look, we're going to stem the drug trade.
*05:13.900- 05:19.220* :  I mentioned the fact that it used to be a relative bastion of calm Ecuador in our violent region.
*05:19.440- 05:22.280* :  Why has this been happening recently over the recent years?
*05:23.420- 05:28.580* :  Absolutely right, Nick. It used to be a relatively calm country, but its geographical
*05:28.620- 05:35.260* :  location has given it that disadvantage of being sandwiched between Colombia and Peru,
*05:35.560- 05:42.320* :  which other two largest cocaine producers in the whole world. And because Ecuador was relatively
*05:42.320- 05:48.880* :  calm, its police force was not as well trained to deal with armed gangs, not as well trained as
*05:48.880- 05:55.000* :  those of Colombia, for example, the police force and the army there. So, international cocaine
*05:55.000- 06:01.720* :  gangs realized that and saw an opportunity to move into Ecuador and smuggle the cocaine that
*06:01.720- 06:06.940* :  is produced in Colombia and in Peru through Ecuador, which has large ports, into the US.
*06:07.320- 06:12.920* :  So, they took advantage of the relative calmness of Ecuador. And of course, as that has grown on
*06:12.920- 06:19.800* :  and international cartels like Sinaloa Cartel and the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci√≥n,
*06:19.800- 06:25.980* :  two major Mexican cartels have moved in. This violence has just exploded in Ecuador.
*06:26.620- 06:32.060* :  That was Vanessa Bouchluta. On Saturday, Taiwan will elect a new president,
*06:32.060- 06:38.060* :  an election that China has called a choice between peace and war. Taiwan's separation from China
*06:38.060- 06:44.460* :  is seen in Beijing as an aberration, an unresolved issue from China's civil war. In 1949,
*06:44.460- 06:51.400* :  the victorious communist drove China's nationalist leader, Chiang Kai Shek, from power. He fled to Taiwan,
*06:51.400- 06:56.920* :  setting up a rival government there. But to date, Taiwan is a democracy and its people are free to
*06:56.920- 07:01.140* :  choose the government they want. And as our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes has been
*07:01.140- 07:05.920* :  finding out, 75 years on fewer and fewer people there feel any attachment to China.
*07:07.320- 07:13.740* :  I have come to a very surreal place about an hour south of Taipei. I'm in a park surrounded by
*07:13.740- 07:20.480* :  forest and this park is full. I mean full of statues of one man, Chiang Kai Shek.
*07:20.680- 07:28.440* :  I've come here with a 94-year-old veteran of Chiang's army. Fan fled China along with
*07:28.440- 07:35.140* :  hundreds of thousands of nationalist soldiers. He's been in Taiwan for 75 years, but has never stopped
*07:35.140- 07:45.380* :  feeling Chinese. Taiwan is a province. It is still a part of China. Slowly, the differences between
*07:45.380- 07:55.960* :  us will narrow until we are the same. Then we can achieve unification. Chiang Kai Shek tried to
*07:55.960- 08:02.080* :  turn Taiwan into a mini version of the China he'd left behind. Taipei's streets are still named
*08:02.100- 08:07.980* :  after important Chinese cities. People here were taught there was no such thing as being Taiwanese.
*08:14.860- 08:19.640* :  So that's the sound of the changing guard at the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial in the middle of Taipei.
*08:19.900- 08:25.520* :  This enormous marble edifice still dominates the center of the city with a huge statue
*08:25.520- 08:33.320* :  of Chiang Kai Shek sitting gazing down at his subjects. Chiang's project to turn Taiwanese people
*08:33.320- 08:39.660* :  into good citizens of China ultimately failed. Today around 70 percent of people here say they are
*08:39.660- 08:47.560* :  Taiwanese, not Chinese. This heavy steel gate is a the ancient way to a cell block in what was
*08:48.460- 08:53.860* :  called the Jingmei detention center and it's where they brought political prisoners to be put on
*08:53.860- 09:00.980* :  trial and imprisoned for political crime. 86-year-old John Chen shows me the bare concrete cell where he
*09:00.980- 09:09.120* :  spent 10 years for supporting Taiwan independence. He's one of around 140,000 locked up for opposing
*09:09.120- 09:15.920* :  Chiang Kai Shek's rule. I don't consider myself Chinese. Taiwan is already a great country but due
*09:15.920- 09:22.600* :  to the influence of the Chinese Communist Party we can't declare independence. The current mainland
*09:22.600- 09:29.120* :  and Taiwan are of course very different. My feeling is that we share the same ethnicity which is
*09:29.120- 09:35.220* :  true but in terms of culture and habits it's still quite different. Much has changed since the days
*09:35.220- 09:41.340* :  of military dictatorship. Taiwan is now a fully fledged democracy and people here are about to
*09:41.340- 09:49.640* :  vote for a new president. In a small city on Taiwan's west coast Chiang Kai Shek's old nationalist
*09:49.640- 09:58.440* :  party the KMT is holding a noisy nighttime rally. Today the KMT campaigns on having good relations
*09:58.440- 10:06.660* :  with China but no one talks of unification. And Taiwanese but my ancestors come from China
*10:06.660- 10:15.920* :  we have the same blood. I am definitely Taiwanese but I think at this stage there is no way for us
*10:15.920- 10:23.940* :  to separate from China. I think the current situation is really good just keep it as it is now.
*10:23.940- 10:34.180* :  Taiwan is very different from China. It has dozens of political parties and noisy energetic
*10:34.180- 10:40.740* :  elections. People here are free to choose who they are and how to live. Most say they are Taiwanese
*10:40.740- 10:48.700* :  not Chinese and they don't want that to change. Rupert Wingfield hates reporting.
*10:50.060- 10:56.080* :  The war in Gaza shows no sign of reducing in intensity but already diplomats are considering
*10:56.080- 11:01.820* :  what happens when it does. Who will govern the strip? How will it be rebuilt and who will pay for it all?
*11:02.080- 11:07.260* :  The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been in the West Bank meeting Mahmoud Abbas
*11:07.320- 11:12.120* :  the head of the Palestinian Authority which Washington hopes could take political control of
*11:12.120- 11:17.900* :  Gaza after the conflict ends. It's a follow on from Mr Blinken's talks with the Israeli Prime Minister
*11:17.900- 11:23.920* :  Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday in which he criticized Israel for undermining the
*11:23.920- 11:28.980* :  Palestinian's ability to govern themselves. You'll now is our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*11:29.620- 11:35.400* :  Of course Washington is looking to the Palestinian Authority to be a big part of post-war plans
*11:35.400- 11:40.260* :  for governance in Gaza but it is stressing that reforms are badly needed. There has been a
*11:40.260- 11:46.100* :  suggestion that perhaps there could be a shift towards a technocratic government for the Palestinians
*11:46.100- 11:52.220* :  one that could have control in future over both the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
*11:52.520- 11:57.120* :  But there's a long way to go before that can happen. And of course this is another opportunity
*11:57.120- 12:02.200* :  for Mr Blinken to reiterate that he's interested in this idea of regional integration.
*12:02.200- 12:07.320* :  He's not been really expecting any breakthroughs in talks he's had with the Israelis but he's been
*12:07.320- 12:12.860* :  really pressing for the idea of a practical pathway to be laid out for the creation of a Palestinian
*12:13.180- 12:18.100* :  state. Saying that many countries in the region Arab neighbors of Israel are ready to invest in
*12:18.100- 12:25.040* :  the future of Gaza if they have that idea of an end in sight to the decade's long Israel Palestinian
*12:25.040- 12:30.060* :  conflict. Clearly one of the problems at the moment is Mr Abbas's credibility in political
*12:30.060- 12:35.860* :  legitimacy amongst Palestinian it is very low isn't it? That's right and his popularity ratings
*12:35.860- 12:40.500* :  have fallen even lower during the course of this war with a suspicion among the Palestinian
*12:40.500- 12:46.680* :  public that the unpopular Palestinian authority leaders could be seen to be going into Gaza
*12:46.680- 12:51.700* :  on the back of an Israeli tank to use a popular phrase around here. That is something that
*12:51.700- 12:56.920* :  the Palestinian Authority is only too aware of and I'm sure Washington is only too aware of as well
*12:56.920- 13:02.300* :  so there will have to be greater steps taken towards boosting the credibility the legitimacy
*13:02.380- 13:09.060* :  revitalizing the Palestinian authority. I'd another concern for Mr Blinken is a wider
*13:09.060- 13:13.960* :  escalation of violence of the region and that's highlighted by a big uptick here in the drones and
*13:13.960- 13:19.180* :  missiles being fired by the Houthis from Yemen isn't it? Indeed and we've had what is being
*13:19.180- 13:25.940* :  described by the British Defense Secretary as the largest attack by the Houthis to date in the
*13:25.940- 13:31.920* :  Red Sea and we know that a British naval ship along with US warships was involved in repelling
*13:31.920- 13:38.640* :  that destroying multiple attack drones something like 20 of these attack drones along with
*13:38.640- 13:44.540* :  missiles were fired from Yemen it seems towards international shipping lanes that's what the
*13:44.840- 13:48.440* :  US Central Command says where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.
*13:49.380- 13:55.260* :  As Yalan Nell, hearings begin at the International Court of Justice in the Hague today on the
*13:55.260- 14:01.160* :  genocide case brought against Israel by South Africa. The court is part of the UN its business is
*14:01.160- 14:06.920* :  often territorial disputes but there have been and there are now some cases involving genocide
*14:06.920- 14:13.560* :  allegations including against Russia and Myanmar. Israel says the case is baseless but it's
*14:13.560- 14:18.820* :  taking it very seriously as we heard from our international editor Jeremy Bowie. Even though they
*14:18.820- 14:24.680* :  have condemned it they've said it's a blood libel they're also sending a very high powered
*14:24.680- 14:29.820* :  legal delegation including a British expert on international law and a former chief justice
*14:29.820- 14:35.640* :  of Israel Aaron Barak who is in fact the Holocaust survivor he was sent to a ghetto by the Nazis
*14:36.340- 14:43.720* :  in Lithuania as a child because I think what the ICJ can do cases drag on for years but they can
*14:43.720- 14:50.660* :  issue an interim court order which could call on Israel to stop its offensive and because of the
*14:50.660- 14:57.000* :  weight of the ICJ it's an international body that it's connected to the UN system that is something
*14:57.000- 15:03.060* :  that the Israelis have to take seriously which is why they're not just dismissing it they're sending
*15:03.060- 15:08.460* :  over a very high powered delegation to try to fight these accusations since it means that Israel
*15:08.460- 15:14.580* :  in a legal context well I think for the first time they will have to provide legal arguments as
*15:14.580- 15:21.160* :  to why what they're doing is not in breach of the 1948 genocide convention in the very long
*15:21.160- 15:28.240* :  84 page document that South Africa has submitted to the ICJ it makes a point that genocide is distinct
*15:28.240- 15:36.360* :  from other war crimes Israel is accused of in Gaza EG collective punishment of civilians though
*15:36.360- 15:42.140* :  it's related to it and the South Africans also say that this should be placed in the context of
*15:42.420- 15:48.980* :  this is a quote 75 year apartheid 56 year belligerent occupation and Palestinian territory
*15:48.980- 15:55.680* :  and a 16 year blockade of Gaza and they're also citing statements by senior Israelis there are
*15:55.680- 16:02.680* :  some extreme right wingers in the government who have mused openly about Palestinians being moved
*16:02.680- 16:10.620* :  out of Gaza somewhere else and Jewish settlers going back into that territory Jeremy Bowen
*16:11.600- 16:16.180* :  the president of China has always been a huge football fan and he'd set his sights on his
*16:16.180- 16:21.820* :  country becoming a soccer superpower before even becoming president he outlined a three stage plan
*16:22.080- 16:27.300* :  for the men's national team to qualify for another world cup to host a world cup and to win a
*16:27.300- 16:32.740* :  world cup well this dream has been dealt a bit of a blow after the former coach of China's national
*16:32.740- 16:39.080* :  football team admitted landing his job through bribery Lee Tier also revealed that he'd fix matches
*16:39.080- 16:45.340* :  to secure promotion for two club sides he'd once managed he made the conventions and others in a
*16:45.340- 16:51.020* :  documentary shown on national television in China for more on this I spoke to our Asia Pacific
*16:51.020- 16:57.020* :  editor Mickey Brister really damning revelations here from the former coach Lee Tier who managed
*16:57.020- 17:05.320* :  the Chinese national team between 2020 and 2021 essentially what happened was that he left the team
*17:05.340- 17:12.060* :  as manager he was then arrested for corruption but until now nobody's really understood what he
*17:12.060- 17:17.980* :  was being investigated for but in this documentary he lays out exactly why people have been investigating
*17:17.980- 17:23.420* :  him and that's because he paid a massive bribe nearly half a million US dollars in order to
*17:23.420- 17:29.560* :  secure that position in the top job and that was paid partly by him and partly by a club he was
*17:29.560- 17:35.880* :  managing at the time and in return for this club paying some of the money he took some of their
*17:35.880- 17:39.880* :  players and played them in the national team when they weren't particularly good enough as well
*17:40.240- 17:45.700* :  you indicated there before he even became national coach when he was a coach of two other teams
*17:45.700- 17:51.020* :  he managed to get promotion now he's admitted that he did that through match fixing by pain off
*17:51.020- 17:58.260* :  referees opposing players managers officials involved in the game so real host of corruption he's
*17:58.300- 18:02.820* :  revealed in this documentary so as a result other top officials are under investigation as well but
*18:02.820- 18:08.320* :  do we know why he confessed in this documentary we don't know why he confessed in a documentary in fact
*18:08.320- 18:12.960* :  there hasn't been a legal process I believe at the moment so he hasn't been convicted of any crime
*18:12.960- 18:20.220* :  but it's usual in China and often happens whereby people suspected or accused of crimes then turn
*18:20.220- 18:25.600* :  upon TV confessing to these crimes it's where the government uses to try and tell people that it's
*18:25.600- 18:30.020* :  really sorting out this problem and it's getting to the bottom of it and corruption's a big issue

*18:36.400- 18:40.120* :  a particular issue now it's come back into the fall and I think what the Chinese authorities
*18:40.120- 18:44.880* :  want to do is say they're cleaning up the game but many many officials at the top of the Chinese
*18:44.880- 18:49.700* :  game are being implicated in this and even at the bottom of the game so it doesn't look good

*20:58.160- 21:03.400* :  already been facing disruption due to farmers who are continuing to block roads and protests that
*21:03.400- 21:09.700* :  plans to phase out fuel subsidies combined with a budget crisis at a lackluster economic forecast
*21:09.700- 21:15.800* :  it's let's sum to brand this as german is winter off discontent our Berlin correspondent Jessica
*21:15.800- 21:18.080* :  Parker reports now from the state of brandenburg
*21:20.800- 21:26.600* :  former protests comes to town you really can't miss them they're obviously very big vehicles
*21:26.600- 21:34.020* :  there are a lot of them and they're extremely noisy this demo rolls into the northeastern town of
*21:34.020- 21:41.720* :  a ranyanburg christoph plas at the tato farmer rages at plans to phase out a tax break on diesel fuel
*21:41.740- 21:47.620* :  but he's also angry at other environmental rules coming from government and the EU
*21:47.880- 21:53.040* :  we farmers say we know how to do our work there is so much in the green tea with says you have
*21:53.040- 21:57.760* :  to do it like that you have to do it like that and nobody sees what is the cost at the end
*21:57.760- 22:03.040* :  but a lot of those measures you're talking about they're about making farming more sustainable
*22:03.040- 22:08.820* :  greening the economy isn't that a good thing yeah that's a good thing but we have to do the process
*22:08.820- 22:13.380* :  with the farmers we are we are not saying we cannot change anything or we won't change
*22:14.020- 22:17.640* :  we're changing since years and years and years and now it's too much
*22:20.060- 22:26.260* :  these demos are even getting mentions on local radio traffic reports the level of disruption
*22:26.260- 22:37.420* :  does vary but at a nearby petrol station Alexandra an occupational therapist says for her it's
*22:37.420- 22:46.820* :  a big problem i'm a single man no i'm not happy those who don't have much will at the end of
*22:46.820- 22:55.240* :  the year have even less and those who reach will get richer another motorist filling up
*22:55.240- 23:01.060* :  David backs the farmers but not Chancellor Olaf Schultz's coalition government
*23:01.060- 23:08.160* :  who do you think does have the answer in politics all parties have their pros and cons
*23:08.160- 23:13.400* :  but right now alternative for Deutschland are the only ones looking after the Germans and not others
*23:13.760- 23:19.240* :  many CDAFD has extremist and they're very worried about their popularity
*23:20.100- 23:25.500* :  come on so and so and so well that depends on your perspective but i say that as long as they
*23:25.500- 23:28.920* :  are fighting for us the Germans that's okay so in this of Zion
*23:32.980- 23:38.680* :  David heads off the far right alternative for Deutschland has recently been polling higher than
*23:38.680- 23:43.520* :  ever before and the party's seeking to capitalise on the farmer's protests
*23:46.120- 23:52.080* :  the tractors park up opposite the town hall and the council leader Dirk Bletterman a member of
*23:52.080- 24:00.640* :  chancellor Olaf Schultz's social democratic party comes out to meet us there's quite a lot of
*24:00.640- 24:06.560* :  talking Germany down right now if you look at our economic prospects it's not great but if you
*24:06.560- 24:11.840* :  look at the big profits our businesses have made this has to all be seen in the balance the mood
*24:11.840- 24:19.140* :  does seem quite pessimistic at the moment yeah that's typically German either everybody is
*24:19.140- 24:22.920* :  you foric everything is just terrible we don't do the middle ground
*24:26.620- 24:33.100* :  this farmer's demo wraps up a Germany's bracing for plenty more culminating in an estimated
*24:33.140- 24:37.800* :  10,000 protesters descending on Berlin next week
*24:39.500- 24:45.180* :  Jessica Parker reporting there they must have thought it was a nice addition to the artwork
*24:45.180- 24:51.580* :  last year the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Georgia received a huge icon one of those traditional
*24:51.580- 24:58.160* :  orthodox Christian paintings depicting the majestic figure of St. Patrona it was only this week
*24:58.160- 25:02.740* :  that someone spotted another figure in the painting Joseph Stalin the late Soviet
*25:02.740- 25:08.560* :  dictator and now somebody has vandalised the icon covering that image of Stalin in spray paint
*25:08.560- 25:13.220* :  our Europe regional editor Paul Moss is following the story for those who aren't aware
*25:13.820- 25:18.340* :  Joseph Stalin is held responsible for the murder of millions of people in the former Soviet
*25:18.340- 25:24.140* :  Union many of them in Georgia which was part of the Soviet Union and he particularly persecuted
*25:24.140- 25:30.340* :  priests and ordinary Christian worshipers however Stalin was a Georgian maybe the most famous
*25:30.340- 25:35.100* :  Georgian in history and there are still many people in the country who remain proud of what they
*25:35.100- 25:41.760* :  see as a national hero but it also turns out this painting the icon of St. Patrona was donated to
*25:41.760- 25:48.500* :  the church by a pro-Russian political party now Georgia currently is bitterly divided between pro
*25:48.500- 25:54.000* :  and anti-Russian factions so I think we could see this row as part of a bigger row an ongoing
*25:54.000- 25:57.920* :  struggle I mean there've been arguments about whether there should be direct flights between the
*25:57.920- 26:02.640* :  Georgian capital and Moscow there've been rouse about how to treat all the Russians who fled to
*26:02.640- 26:07.180* :  Georgia since the war with Ukraine started and now they're having the rouse through the medium
*26:07.180- 26:11.800* :  of this painting which as you say the latest salvo it's been covered in paint sure you say the
*26:11.800- 26:17.140* :  political party that donated this painting was pro-Russian but why would they choose to show that by
*26:17.140- 26:22.800* :  effectively praising Joseph Stalin well quite simply Vladimir Putin is a bit of a Joseph Stalin
*26:23.160- 26:28.020* :  fan I mean since he came to power dozens of monuments to Stalin have appeared around Russia and
*26:28.020- 26:34.040* :  he's praised Stalin as a great man and not difficult to see why I mean Stalin his name means man
*26:34.040- 26:39.240* :  of steel he rules the Soviet Union with an iron fist he was a militarist who tried to gobble up
*26:39.240- 26:44.120* :  neighboring countries and indeed after the Second World War extended the Soviet influence into
*26:44.120- 26:50.000* :  Eastern Europe and you know what it does seem to be working the highly respected levada center for
*26:50.000- 26:55.720* :  30 years has been asking people in Russia what do you think of Stalin when they started 30 years
*26:55.720- 27:02.540* :  ago only 20 percent of Russian said they respected Stalin by 2012 that figure had doubled and last
*27:02.540- 27:07.580* :  year they found that nearly half of Russians respected Stalin so you know that's the kind of
*27:07.900- 27:12.500* :  approval ratings a lot of politicians would be very grateful for and interestingly more recently
*27:12.500- 27:18.420* :  they tried to portray Stalin as a Christian figure and it seems some Georgians want that figure in
*27:18.420- 27:22.360* :  their church and briefly but what's going to happen to this painting now well the police are
*27:22.360- 27:26.800* :  hunting whoever did it they think it's a well-known human rights figure interestingly the church
*27:26.800- 27:31.280* :  was contacted about why they had a picture of Stalin and the the priest responsible got rather
*27:31.280- 27:36.800* :  angry it would only just be Christmas in the Russian Orthodox church January 7th and he just said
*27:36.800- 27:44.360* :  why are the media wanting to spoil Christmas by covering this story Paul Moss and now to Las Vegas
*27:44.360- 27:50.380* :  where the world's largest consumer tech show CES is taking place thousands of companies
*27:50.380- 27:55.640* :  show off their latest products giving us a glimpse into what will soon be coming to our high streets
*27:56.500- 28:00.680* :  there will be no surprise that our official intelligence is a key feature this year
*28:00.880- 28:05.880* :  our North America technology reporter James Clayton has been trying out some of the latest products
*28:15.520- 28:22.460* :  is your pillow so boring that it isn't even AI capable if I was going to summarize CES it would
*28:22.460- 28:28.940* :  boil down to companies trying to convince people that AI is needed in everything no product can
*28:28.940- 28:35.540* :  escape the tide of artificial intelligence I'm in one of the busiest areas right now this is
*28:35.960- 28:44.360* :  Samsung's showcase and I'm in the AI section and if you can imagine error washing machines fridges
*28:45.100- 28:50.960* :  it's kind of like being in a Samsung shop really but every single wall is emblazoned with two
*28:50.960- 28:58.940* :  letters AI all of these things are in theory powered by AI they're all AI capable in some way
*28:59.280- 29:05.280* :  so I'm going to try and speak to someone and see they can tell me a why do they need to be AI
*29:05.280- 29:13.260* :  enabled and B is this actually AI you're going to see the AI function right this is Amy from
*29:13.260- 29:19.140* :  Samsung talking me through an AI powered vacuum cleaner which looks very much like a normal vacuum
*29:19.140- 29:26.100* :  cleaner once you go into a different type of flooring give it just a second and you'll see
*29:27.240- 29:32.420* :  that's going to change so it's definitely got some more power right so you've not pressed anything
*29:32.420- 29:38.960* :  that I'm not pressed anything do we actually need an AI vacuum cleaner do we need it of course you
*29:38.960- 29:45.940* :  do I actually have done something terrible for my health I'm allergic to cats do I have a cat
*29:46.620- 29:52.580* :  he's so cute and so Ollie's here on the the rug in the living room I can now confidently say
*29:52.580- 29:59.840* :  that's coming up and it'll help me in in my health as well right so AI can help you keep having a
*29:59.840- 30:07.040* :  cat yes that's the cell exactly okay the AI fridge here can detect what foods you have and suggest
*30:07.040- 30:13.980* :  recipes the washing machine can apparently detect types of fabric so it's learning your specific
*30:13.980- 30:19.280* :  flow absolutely so this will just get more efficient more efficient more efficient over time right
*30:19.280- 30:23.720* :  so there is machine learning in this because that's that's one of the big sort of I guess people
*30:23.720- 30:27.620* :  are slightly skeptical about some of this stuff because it's like is this actually AI is this
*30:27.620- 30:32.760* :  actually machine learning but you're saying it is yes elsewhere at the show an AI mirror made by
*30:32.760- 30:38.940* :  barracuda can analyze your face and tell you what skincare regime you need so on standing in front
*30:38.940- 30:45.860* :  of a round mirror it looks like a completely normal mirror but behind it is a scream
*30:46.980- 30:54.140* :  and a camera so I can step towards the mirror take a picture of myself and then in theory it will
*30:54.240- 31:01.580* :  analyze my skin and tell me what I need to do to make my skin look better so I'm going to have a
*31:01.580- 31:11.480* :  go now this could be brutal I'm quite jet lags oh I'm actually noticeable so it's literally
*31:11.480- 31:18.000* :  giving me an eye bag which I need cleanser peptides in my eye cream a serum and retinal cream
*31:19.240- 31:26.060* :  pretty harsh but maybe AI is telling me what no one else would dare to but a word of warning about
*31:26.060- 31:32.160* :  all these new AI products two years ago everyone here was talking about the metaverse and this
*31:32.160- 31:39.280* :  year almost no one is it's notoriously difficult in tech to work out what's a fad and what's the
*31:39.280- 31:44.780* :  new big thing James Clayton there now we want to take you to the forest of Vietnam
*31:52.760- 31:59.600* :  that is the rather beautiful sound of the world's second rarest ape the Gibbon in its natural
*31:59.600- 32:05.880* :  habitats and this recording is significant it's been used to help measure the population's size
*32:05.880- 32:12.560* :  of the critically endangered cow bit Gibbon Divina Gupta spoke to the project lead on other when
*32:13.360- 32:18.180* :  the local communities that we work with they told us that they could seemingly tell apart
*32:18.180- 32:24.420* :  different given groups so we wanted to try and use that idea to see if we could count them from
*32:24.420- 32:30.400* :  their songs so after setting out all these microphones in the habitat we downloaded all the data
*32:30.400- 32:37.880* :  and made spectrograms which are visual like pictures of the sounds and we could see suddenly it was
*32:37.880- 32:42.640* :  like a bit of a eureka moment we could see the different songs from the different individuals were
*32:42.640- 32:48.040* :  very different and that allowed us to count the population size much more accurately than
*32:48.040- 32:54.220* :  as impossible before and their numbers though are less than 100 from what you found out I believe
*32:54.220- 33:01.660* :  why is that yeah so they're now found in only a single habitat a single forest block on the
*33:01.660- 33:06.780* :  border between Vietnam and China so they live in a very small area they're constrained and the
*33:06.780- 33:13.160* :  habitat also is not in a great state it's been suffering from degradation for many decades so the
*33:13.160- 33:19.920* :  population is somewhat depressed at this point but with restoration we think the future could be
*33:19.920- 33:25.020* :  hopeful for this species and we know what we need to do we just need to get on and restore the
*33:25.020- 33:32.000* :  habitat by limiting grazing planting trees and that kind of thing do you see that female are talking
*33:32.000- 33:36.820* :  more than the male is that something that you witnessed in this group so the calvary given it
*33:36.820- 33:42.960* :  sings they sing their song as a trio so it happens over like a 15 minute period and the male does
*33:42.960- 33:48.580* :  actually most of the singing and then over a number of minutes then the two females in each group
*33:48.580- 33:55.140* :  usually they suddenly sing in this big crescendo like a vibrato twitter-like song which we call
*33:55.140- 34:01.380* :  the great call and the two females sing that in response to the male and then the male sings again
*34:01.380- 34:06.780* :  in reply to females so they have this coordinated kind of trio song that they do
*34:10.160- 34:17.420* :  that was Oliver Wen and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global
