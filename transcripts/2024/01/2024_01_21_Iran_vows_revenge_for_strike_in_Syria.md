*00:00.000- 00:03.540* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:04.820- 00:09.680* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Sunday 21 January, these are our main stories.
*00:09.680- 00:18.040* :  Iran warns Israel of reprisals following an air strike on Damascus in Syria that killed five members of Tehran's revolutionary guard.
*00:21.180- 00:24.640* :  At around 10.30 we heard the sound of three consecutive explosions.
*00:24.740- 00:28.980* :  They targeted the building here behind us. We were shocked and shaken.
*00:29.660- 00:34.620* :  In the Democratic Republic of Congo Felix Shisekedi is sworn in as president again.
*00:41.240- 00:45.200* :  Slovakia's Prime Minister Cecil Vito Ukraine's bid to join NATO.
*00:48.100- 00:55.680* :  Also in this podcast, Nikki Haley questions Donald Trump's mental fitness ahead of the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire.
*00:56.920- 01:02.420* :  She actually had a duplication of her pelvis, so she was quite remarkable looking.
*01:03.020- 01:08.520* :  Stay tuned to find out about a dog that needed an operation to become a four-legged friend.
*01:14.100- 01:19.060* :  The Middle East has been on a heightened alert since the 7th of October attack by her mass on Israel.
*01:19.580- 01:25.180* :  That resulted in Israel's military response in Gaza and increasing tensions spilling across borders.
*01:25.860- 01:34.180* :  Now five members of Iran's revolutionary guard, including the head of their information unit, have been killed by an air strike on the Syrian capital Damascus.
*01:34.780- 01:39.980* :  Iran has been quick to pin blame on Israel with Tehran declaring it reserves the right to respond.
*01:39.980- 01:44.980* :  This local resident Salama heard the blast from his home in the Syrian capital.
*01:47.360- 01:50.800* :  At around 10.30 we heard the sound of three consecutive explosions.
*01:50.800- 01:56.120* :  They targeted the building here behind us. We were shocked and shaken. Everything is broken.
*01:56.120- 01:59.400* :  The fence flew from the building that was struck and came into our kitchen.
*02:00.100- 02:06.580* :  Our correspondent, Mike Loen, is in Jerusalem, and I asked him, is Israel likely to be behind Saturday's attack?
*02:07.260- 02:14.860* :  It's very likely to be behind this attack, but we are very unlikely to hear a confirmation from the horse's mouth here in Israel,
*02:14.860- 02:19.820* :  because Israel very rarely confirms that it is behind military operations abroad.
*02:19.820- 02:25.820* :  But as you say, Val, there have been hundreds of Israeli strikes in Syria during the course of the Syrian Civil War and on Iranian-backed positions.
*02:25.820- 02:32.820* :  There was another suspected Israeli air strike on Christmas Day actually that killed a senior Iranian general in Syria.
*02:32.820- 02:39.220* :  Earlier this month an Israeli strike presumed Israeli strike killed a top Hezbollah commander.
*02:39.220- 02:43.060* :  That was the pro-Iranian militia in Lebanon and that commander was killed in Lebanon.
*02:43.580- 02:47.240* :  So Israel has frequently militarily reached beyond its borders.
*02:47.780- 02:54.420* :  And the fear continues really that the Gaza conflict will continue to spill over into this wider volatile region,
*02:54.500- 02:59.360* :  which it has already done given these strikes and the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon,
*03:00.120- 03:02.000* :  attacks involving Iran and Iranian proxies.
*03:02.340- 03:06.700* :  And this is such a volatile region that that fear has only been confirmed with the attack today.
*03:07.080- 03:10.380* :  And why are the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Syria?
*03:10.700- 03:17.380* :  They back President Assad and have been providing important military backing and political backing to the Assad regime for years.
*03:17.960- 03:21.580* :  And of course, Iran is the big Shiite power in this region.
*03:21.580- 03:34.160* :  It's tentacles reach way beyond Iran into Lebanon supporting Hezbollah, into Yemen supporting the Houthis there, into Gaza itself arguably supporting Hamas.
*03:34.440- 03:36.080* :  And it is the big enemy of Israel.
*03:36.360- 03:42.260* :  And the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said that they reserved the right to respond to Israel at an appropriate time,
*03:42.260- 03:45.800* :  and they said that this was the murderous Zionist regime once again.
*03:46.340- 03:51.480* :  And this, of course, is against the background as you said of heightened tensions because of Gaza in the region.
*03:52.160- 03:55.240* :  Yeah, obviously that the most intense of military activity is still in Gaza itself.
*03:55.240- 03:58.460* :  Israeli forces are pushing harder and deeper into southern Gaza.
*03:58.500- 04:04.940* :  They are convinced that top Hamas officials are holed up or beneath the southern Gaza City of Hanyunis.
*04:05.300- 04:12.520* :  And the Hamas authorities in Gaza have reported the highest number of people killed in a 24-hour period so far this year.
*04:13.060- 04:17.160* :  About 165 people killed in overnight shelling in southern Gaza on Friday night.
*04:17.160- 04:21.220* :  So even though we're talking about these missiles beyond the region that has captured the headlines today,
*04:21.640- 04:25.280* :  we can't lose sight of the fact that ground zero is still Gaza, of course, itself.
*04:25.860- 04:34.380* :  The situation there is getting worse and, of course, for the population in Gaza, it is incredibly serious with the UN saying that only 15 bakeries are now still operational,
*04:34.560- 04:37.820* :  and they've warned that famine is stalking the entire population of Gaza.
*04:38.880- 04:40.200* :  Mark Lohan in Jerusalem.
*04:40.880- 04:46.180* :  And staying in Israel, thousands of people have attended rallies in Tel Aviv, calling for immediate elections,
*04:46.500- 04:50.260* :  so a new government can be put in place to resolve the war in Gaza.
*04:52.980- 04:55.720* :  I'm completely against this war, there's too many casualties.
*04:55.720- 04:59.680* :  I think it's this war is about revenge and not about a political sense.
*04:59.800- 05:05.000* :  The war doesn't give us any future, there's too many victims, too much sorrow, too much pain again.
*05:05.440- 05:10.340* :  We much get to a political resolution to a new arrangement, we cannot continue to live like these.
*05:10.340- 05:14.560* :  These people are not our enemies, not this majority of civilians that are living in Gaza.
*05:15.440- 05:19.060* :  Mao's in on lost his parents in the October 7th attacks.
*05:19.060- 05:23.280* :  He urged countries to stop giving unlimited backing to Israel.
*05:24.040- 05:31.520* :  All the world leaders stop supporting Israel with no condition and unlimited support, send us aid of reconciliation.
*05:31.520- 05:37.460* :  Peace, aid of share initiatives between Jews, Arab, Israelis and Palestinian.
*05:38.320- 05:43.160* :  As the war continues and the number of Palestinians being killed in Gaza rises every day,
*05:43.160- 05:47.960* :  the reverberations are being felt in Palestinian diaspora communities around the world.
*05:49.080- 05:56.240* :  Salina Bil went to the US suburb of bridge view in Chicago in Illinois, which has long been known as little Palestine.
*05:57.280- 06:00.960* :  Everything around us just feels so Palestinian, so Arab.
*06:01.720- 06:04.060* :  Sometimes you can even forget that you are in the US.
*06:04.860- 06:08.500* :  We've seen restaurants and stores having their names written in Arabic.
*06:09.280- 06:15.140* :  The Palestinian flag hanging down from some balconies, billboards calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*06:15.860- 06:20.020* :  But this show of solidarity can sometimes come with a high price.
*06:20.580- 06:22.020* :  This is the famous sign.
*06:22.540- 06:29.600* :  Since the fighting broke out in Gaza, Leila has had a sign that treats free Palestine in her garden.
*06:30.460- 06:38.240* :  As we stand next to the sign, Leila, a US-born mother of three, explains to me that since putting it up,
*06:38.280- 06:41.760* :  she has received two letters containing death threats.
*06:42.400- 06:44.000* :  I have no trust now with anybody.
*06:44.800- 06:48.100* :  And I'm going to tell you, I'm a friendly, friendly person. I sing hi to everybody.
*06:48.720- 06:51.480* :  But now I have my guard up. I'm not as friendly as I used to be.
*06:51.820- 06:53.280* :  What has changed the fear?
*06:53.560- 06:55.720* :  The fear of not knowing who's behind the letter.
*06:56.260- 06:57.720* :  Is it somebody that I'm shopping with?
*06:58.180- 07:00.360* :  Is it somebody that's in the school with my kids?
*07:00.840- 07:03.020* :  Somebody that I waive to in the morning?
*07:03.020- 07:05.580* :  I don't know. And that's what scares me.
*07:05.860- 07:16.960* :  Leila doesn't only fear for the lives of her three boys, but she's also concerned that her identity as a Muslim woman who wears a hat's scarf might make her a target.
*07:17.500- 07:21.580* :  It's not being able to go outside whenever I want to go outside.
*07:21.580- 07:28.120* :  Sometimes I get scared that maybe the person will come and try to take one of my kids to get back at me.
*07:28.260- 07:32.080* :  I've explained to my kids, if you see somebody trying to hurt me, you run back into the house.
*07:32.700- 07:34.660* :  And don't try to save me. Just run back.
*07:35.120- 07:37.740* :  Did it ever occur to you that that might happen?
*07:38.060- 07:39.980* :  Yes, because it happened to Wadiya.
*07:40.460- 07:41.380* :  So it could happen to me.
*07:41.580- 07:45.880* :  Wadiya Alfe Yumi was a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy,
*07:46.460- 07:49.960* :  stabbed to death in the apartment where he lived with his mom.
*07:49.960- 07:55.280* :  The suspect, his landlord, has been charged with murder and hate crimes.
*08:00.580- 08:04.220* :  Wadiya was a day's only child.
*08:04.880- 08:10.700* :  The man takes me into the room where his son used to sleep when he visited him on weekends.
*08:11.840- 08:17.160* :  A day migrated to the U.S. eight years ago, dreaming of a better life,
*08:17.160- 08:22.600* :  he tells me he hasn't shed a tear yet over his son's tragic death.
*08:22.840- 08:28.480* :  I still hear his voice. He used to come on Saturdays and up till now,
*08:28.480- 08:31.700* :  I still stand next to the window waiting for him.
*08:32.000- 08:35.880* :  I know he won't show up, but it just relieves me to it.
*08:40.680- 08:42.300* :  But over the past couple of months,
*08:42.300- 08:46.220* :  a few Palestinian support rallies took place in Chicago,
*08:46.920- 08:51.380* :  where various communities came together to call for an end to the war.
*08:52.020- 08:58.360* :  Hatem Abu Dheer from the U.S. Palestinian Community Network says solidarity is essential.
*08:58.360- 09:04.000* :  For Palestine support rallies, these are absolutely the biggest that Chicago has ever seen.
*09:04.400- 09:08.980* :  Especially other oppressed communities, the Black community in the United States,
*09:09.620- 09:14.220* :  Latino community, other immigrant communities, the Native communities here, Asian,
*09:15.020- 09:18.220* :  have always been on the side of the Palestinian people.
*09:19.640- 09:24.700* :  A voice there from Bridgeview in Chicago, Illinois, and that report was by Salina Bill.
*09:25.620- 09:29.940* :  The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fitsu, says he's ready to veto Ukraine's bid
*09:29.940- 09:34.900* :  for membership of the NATO military alliance, claiming it would spark a global conflict.
*09:34.900- 09:39.520* :  He said his government would offer humanitarian aid, but no military support.
*09:40.120- 09:41.340* :  Rob Cameron has the details.
*09:42.000- 09:47.960* :  Robert Fitsu will have his first meeting with his Ukrainian opposite number, Dennis Schmihal on Wednesday,
*09:47.960- 09:51.900* :  and as he told Slovak Radio, he's ready to speak his mind.
*09:51.900- 09:54.920* :  There was no military solution to the conflict, he said.
*09:55.480- 09:57.100* :  Instead, there should be negotiations.
*09:57.100- 10:03.220* :  Russia will never leave the Donbass and Crimea, he said, and everyone realizes this.
*10:03.760- 10:10.060* :  And as for Ukraine's bid to join NATO, the Slovak Prime Minister told listeners he would veto it,
*10:10.360- 10:13.720* :  claiming it would lay the foundations for the Third World War.
*10:14.440- 10:15.020* :  Rob Cameron.
*10:15.920- 10:22.940* :  Now to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Felix Schissikady has been sworn in for a controversial second term.
*10:24.320- 10:31.260* :  I, Mr Schissikady Chilomo Felix Antoine,
*10:33.240- 10:37.460* :  elected president of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*10:38.160- 10:44.560* :  The ceremony attended by a dozen African heads of state took place in a packed stadium in the capital Kinshasa.
*10:45.120- 10:48.660* :  In his speech, the President vowed to tackle violence in the east of the country,
*10:49.100- 10:54.120* :  where the M23 is battling other armed groups for control of the mineral-rich region.
*10:54.760- 10:57.760* :  Our reporter, Emory Makameno, was at the inauguration.
*10:58.520- 11:04.280* :  It was quite brief, President Schissikady took the office before the constitutional court charges.
*11:04.280- 11:10.320* :  The people who came in thousands of the stadiums have been waiting for the moment all day long.
*11:10.500- 11:16.440* :  So everything went on very well with jubilation and singing and dancing from the public here.
*11:16.580- 11:19.380* :  It is the biggest football stadium in the DRC.
*11:19.560- 11:28.100* :  Were there any signs of protests because the opposition is refusing to recognize Felix Schissikady's election victory, isn't it?
*11:28.460- 11:32.480* :  Three presidential candidates did, of course, call for a protest,
*11:32.520- 11:43.480* :  but Martin Fajolo and Moïs Katumbi and also Florevera and Zuluni did not give any indication of any rally place where people would have to gather.
*11:43.500- 11:50.620* :  Yes, the three are still rejecting the 73% that the President Philly Gisekady was accredited.
*11:50.620- 11:55.280* :  They say these elections were marked with fraud, with valid staffing.
*11:55.520- 11:59.160* :  These are allegations that were rejected by the constitutional court.
*11:59.580- 12:06.300* :  And Mr Schissikady is facing huge challenges in the country, isn't he? What's he going to address first?
*12:06.620- 12:12.080* :  Well, they did mention problems of insecurity in the eastern part of the DRC,
*12:12.080- 12:20.740* :  where we have at least seven million people who are internally displaced because of a non-going conflict that has been happening there for over two decades.
*12:20.740- 12:24.960* :  But there is also an employment within the youth in particular.
*12:24.960- 12:34.160* :  I say that these are some of his biggest challenges to tackle first steps, but there is also a problem with the instability of the economy.
*12:34.540- 12:39.460* :  Those are some of the few issues that he said shortly after the inauguration during his first speech.
*12:40.160- 12:41.960* :  Emory Makameno in Kinshasa.
*12:42.800- 12:51.260* :  Fans of the Global Hit TV series' succession may know it won six METV awards recently to add to its hall of four golden globes.
*12:51.720- 13:01.220* :  If you haven't seen the series, it depicts a vicious struggle for power in the filthy rich and totally dysfunctional family of fictional media mogul Logan Roy.
*13:01.580- 13:09.180* :  It's a toxic mix of extreme wealth, media, politics are infused with a modern take on Shakespeare's King Lear.
*13:09.820- 13:20.840* :  Well, the BBC's Nick Robinson has been speaking to succession's creator and writer Jesse Armstrong and asked him why a story about such unpleasant people is so compelling.
*13:21.620- 13:25.180* :  I can't explain it's success. I didn't think about it in those terms when we started out.
*13:25.320- 13:35.080* :  Although the things that the characters do and their moral behavior is sometimes reprehensible and the stuff they do to the world and has bad outcomes.
*13:35.080- 13:44.160* :  I don't think of them as irredeemable. I guess I think of them as the products of their family, their environment, their culture.
*13:44.160- 13:50.760* :  And within those contexts, their actions are sort of maybe more explicable, if not excusable.
*13:51.000- 13:57.440* :  When people first saw the series, they inevitably said, yes, it's the Murdoch's. And then people say, oh, there's a bit of the Maxwell's there.
*13:58.040- 14:03.240* :  My sense is you looked at powerful dysfunctional families dating back not just decades, but centuries.
*14:03.460- 14:14.400* :  Dead right. I mean, no succession moments, you know, have been terrific me and drink for writers forever and imperial succession, royal succession, corporate succession of all fed in.
*14:14.400- 14:19.800* :  Obviously, you know, we have a right wing TV news network like Rupert Murdoch had and has still.
*14:20.260- 14:25.200* :  So there's that clear parallel, but then we also have a cruise line and you know, some of the red stone has been mentioned.
*14:25.200- 14:30.680* :  Conrad Black, the people in the media will be able to see lots and lots of story lines that we've taken from the real world.
*14:31.080- 14:36.460* :  Do you in a curious way, though, who Donald Trump? I was going to say a thank you. I doubt you'll ever say that.
*14:36.500- 14:42.560* :  It could be argued that Trump helped create the backdrop, which gave people the appetite for succession.
*14:42.560- 14:45.100* :  You had your first read through of the script and you on the day was elected.
*14:45.580- 14:52.740* :  That's dead right. And yeah, and I have reflected on that somewhat roofily or with mixed feelings that I think you're, you know, it's a counterfactual.
*14:52.740- 14:59.640* :  I don't know how it would have landed in a Clinton presidency. There may have been other issues, which had made it feel salient.
*14:59.640- 15:14.580* :  Yeah, I think this kind of imperial rather gross in some ways family and their intonisine fighting did fit that Trump era and the long tail we've had on it, which still possibly has a rattle on that tail.
*15:14.860- 15:20.440* :  Now great characters you've described characters that in a way you empathized with that you even liked.
*15:21.020- 15:24.360* :  How about a spin off of one of those? I mean, it worked for cheers. They got phrased.
*15:25.520- 15:35.140* :  The characters I could think of a spin off for. Well, yeah, it's nice that people can feel that life, but that doesn't feel like the most interesting thing to do to me.
*15:35.300- 15:43.900* :  Not even a Greg, given that you're the Greg. I mean, if I had to, I would like to, but sadly, I feel like me and the writers room have written them enough now.
*15:44.700- 15:50.540* :  Jesse Armstrong, the writer and creator of the TV series succession speaking there to Nick Robinson.
*15:52.760- 15:54.520* :  Still to calm on the global news podcast.
*16:00.660- 16:07.600* :  The bits are paid to Mary Weiss, the lead singer of the Shangri-La's, who's died at the age of 75.
*16:16.420- 16:27.740* :  In the United States, the Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley has questioned Donald Trump's mental fitness as campaigning intensifies ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
*16:27.740- 16:40.100* :  The former UN ambassador raised the issue after Mr. Trump appeared to confuse her with the Democrat politician Nancy Pelosi falsely accusing her of failing to stop the January 6th attacks on the Capitol.
*16:40.920- 16:47.160* :  The former president is also being challenged by the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis from Washington will burn in reports.
*16:48.020- 17:00.000* :  Five days ago, Donald Trump won the Iowa caucuses with a record-breaking 51% of the vote with his two closest rivals, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis trailing him by around 30 points.
*17:00.000- 17:08.720* :  Now, Mr. Trump appears set for a resounding victory in the state of New Hampshire, where he's on around 50% according to the latest polling.
*17:09.220- 17:17.940* :  The former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who seems to be pinning all her hopes on success in the state, is currently on around 34% in the polls.
*17:17.940- 17:27.800* :  Today, she questioned Mr. Trump's mental fitness for office after he appeared to confuse her with the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a campaign speech.
*17:45.380- 17:53.740* :  Nikki Haley has stepped up her attacks on Mr. Trump in recent days, framing the race as a two-person contest between her and the former president.
*17:53.740- 17:59.900* :  The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, is in a distant third place in New Hampshire, polling in the single digits.
*18:00.580- 18:11.080* :  Pressure is now mounting on Ms. Haley. If she fails to produce a strong result, it may prove almost impossible to prevent Donald Trump's march towards the Republican nomination.
*18:11.860- 18:21.360* :  We'll Vernon. India is planning to build a fence along its border with Myanmar, according to India's Interior Minister Amit Shah, in an effort to boost security.
*18:21.600- 18:33.380* :  The two countries have more than 1,600 kilometers of shared border. A South Asia Regional Editor and Barassan Etheragent Toby White thousands of people have been moving across it in recent years.
*18:34.300- 18:47.620* :  India's northeast sheds border with Myanmar. As of now, there is a conflict going on in Myanmar itself, various insurgent groups, ethnic communities. They are fighting against the Myanmar army.
*18:47.620- 19:04.500* :  So thousands of ethnic communities have been fleeing. In addition to that, after the Arakan rebel army, overrun several towns and military camps in Myanmar, in fact a couple of days ago more than 275 Myanmar soldiers also fled to India.
*19:04.980- 19:22.040* :  Of course, most of these soldiers were repatriated to Myanmar because the Indian Myanmar, they have close relations. But it also shows how the India's northeast sheds very close, ethnic, cultural and linguistic connections with Myanmar and the border is open.
*19:22.140- 19:35.480* :  And now there is also an ethnic conflict going on in the state of Manipur, where there is a maithy population where they are living mostly in the valley and the indigenous community called Kukizo. They are living up in the hills.
*19:35.480- 19:41.340* :  These communities, they share close relations with the same people on the other side of the border.
*19:41.860- 19:54.480* :  So now the government suspects that some of these militant groups on the Indian side getting help from the people on the other side. And that is why the government is now contemplating fencing this nearly 1,600 kilometer border.
*19:55.040- 19:57.180* :  But that would be a huge undertaking, wouldn't it?
*19:57.340- 20:03.720* :  It will cost a lot of money. It will take a long time. It's going to be a big challenge because it is a very difficult terrain.
*20:03.720- 20:12.820* :  I have been to Mori, which is the border town in Manipur state. And the border is open. You can just walk across the Myanmar side and come back.
*20:12.880- 20:29.880* :  You know, this is a history behind this. Until 1937, Burma, Myanmar all now, was part of British India and then they became separate. And even after India gained independence from Britain, the people along this border were allowed to move across because they were from the same communities.
*20:29.880- 20:43.120* :  It was between two colonies before. Now you have an international border. So to allow the movement of people, the governments initially agreed for 40 kilometers they can move from this side to that side without any passport or visa.
*20:43.120- 20:52.740* :  Then it was later reduced to 16 kilometers. Now if you put this fence across, it is going to divide these communities. They have a marital relationship. They do trade.
*20:52.740- 21:05.600* :  This is all informal trade between ethnic indigenous communities. And that is going to anger because already this region is very tense with competing claims by various ethnic communities. And it is going to increase the anger.
*21:05.960- 21:10.340* :  What the analysts say are likely to lose the goodwill of these indigenous communities.
*21:10.500- 21:24.520* :  One of the world's top prizes for architecture has been awarded to a woman who hasn't herself built that much, but has been one of the most distinctive and influential voices of her generation.
*21:24.820- 21:38.940* :  The Royal Institute of British Architects gave its gold medal to Leslie Lockeau, a Ghanaian Scottish teacher and author whose mission in the words of her citation has been to democratize, decolonize and reimagine architecture.
*21:39.680- 21:43.480* :  Tim Franks asked her how she felt when she heard she'd won the prize.
*21:44.220- 21:51.060* :  That was really knocked sideways because I'm not a practicing architect. This sort of award just never thought it would come to someone like me.
*21:51.600- 21:57.100* :  So it was an enormous surprise. And then when I picked myself up, I kind of thought, well, yeah, it's special.
*21:57.400- 22:08.480* :  It is special. You do touch on the fact that you are not somebody who has a great body of buildings behind you. I was really that you got your PhD by building a mud brick house.
*22:08.740- 22:12.940* :  Yes, my own house. Yes, which I mean, there's a wonderful thing to do.
*22:12.940- 22:22.740* :  Given that you're not an architect, I know that the citation says that you've been phenomenally influential in terms of what you have brought to architecture.
*22:22.740- 22:28.320* :  What would you say you would immodestly like to think of as your distinctive contribution?
*22:29.340- 22:37.620* :  For me, it goes back to something that the most influential tutor I had, Jonathan Hill, who passed away last year said to me that the term architect is protected in law,
*22:37.620- 22:44.500* :  but fortunately, the term architecture has no such legal protection and that architecture is a wider category than the building of buildings.
*22:44.500- 22:58.500* :  I have to say I genuinely believe it. In some ways, it's almost coincidental that these interests in kind of climate change and social justice and equity and racial justice have come about now sort of 30 years after I started looking at them.
*22:58.500- 23:04.860* :  But I think without that wider understanding of architecture, it would be quite hard to find space for those kinds of concerns.
*23:05.280- 23:18.040* :  And I suppose actually, I mean, it is a absolute trism, isn't it, to say that architecture is about buildings and buildings are about people, about environments, about the ways in which they're used, how they're placed and all the rest of it.
*23:18.380- 23:27.260* :  100% and also, I mean, building shape the way we are in the world with each other and with the environment, but it's a much broader category than the bricks and mortar.
*23:27.500- 23:31.640* :  And so this award, I think, has really thrown a spotlight on that.
*23:32.080- 23:43.020* :  Tell me about the practice of architecture in particular in Africa, because I mean, I know that that's something that you've championed in all sorts of ways, but I was reading.
*23:43.020- 23:47.360* :  I think it was a quote from you that said that in a continent of almost a billion.
*23:47.620- 23:52.480* :  There were fewer than 90 accredited architecture schools, which seems stunning.
*23:52.480- 23:58.320* :  It is on the one hand, but I think we have to remember that the vast majority of buildings are done without architects.
*23:58.320- 24:06.480* :  So it's not to say that there isn't a huge energy and a huge amount of building going on, but the training of an architect is still quite a specialist and elitist subject.
*24:07.320- 24:13.860* :  And I think the attempts to broaden who sees themselves as, you know, potential architect is really important.
*24:13.920- 24:22.340* :  I think of my niece who just qualified actually in the UK, she just got her part three as an architect in the world of architecture that she's coming into is a very different one than the worlds that I entered.
*24:22.340- 24:31.120* :  So in some ways, I hope that this award shows people, especially on the home continent, that actually anything's possible, that you can be involved in the built in environment in many different ways.
*24:31.480- 24:36.120* :  I mean, I think in my year at the Bartlett, I think there were two people of color, and I think there were six women.
*24:36.120- 24:37.960* :  I mean, I've got that wrong. It's about 30 years ago.
*24:38.140- 24:38.900* :  Out of hell in it.
*24:39.280- 24:39.880* :  A hundred maybe.
*24:40.020- 24:41.720* :  And it's a very, very different world now.
*24:41.960- 24:48.900* :  But I also think that in terms of understanding writing and filmmaking and installation and art and sociology and politics as being part of,
*24:49.060- 24:58.480* :  let's say architectural language, that's very different to what it was like 30 years ago when it was literally planned section elevation and history of architecture and it was a particular kind of history as well.
*24:58.920- 25:00.180* :  I think that's definitely changed.
*25:00.860- 25:04.780* :  And I think the architecture of field that I entered 30 years ago was incredibly silent.
*25:04.980- 25:09.920* :  You know, the separation between an architect and an urbanist, between a landscape architect, between the interiors.
*25:10.080- 25:11.780* :  All of those things were very tightly monitored.
*25:12.160- 25:13.760* :  I think the world is much more fluid now.
*25:13.940- 25:21.480* :  And Africa is an amazing place to cross disciplinary boundaries partly because that infrastructure of segregation isn't as strong there.
*25:22.040- 25:24.760* :  Leslie Loco speaking there to Tim Franks.
*25:25.740- 25:30.060* :  The lead singer of the Shangri-La's Mary Weiss has died at the age of 75.
*25:30.820- 25:38.060* :  The Shangri-La's were a New York singing group back in the 1960s, made up of two sets of sisters and with hits like leader of the pack.
*25:38.360- 25:42.340* :  They're often considered to be the precursor to so-called girl bands.
*25:42.340- 25:47.800* :  They were contemporaries of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and performed with both groups.
*25:48.440- 25:54.820* :  And some of the Shangri-La's songs did have a fairly morbid element as music journalist Simon Price explains.
*25:55.840- 25:59.680* :  They had these bright cheerful pop hits like give them a great big kiss.
*26:09.980- 26:17.560* :  But overwhelmingly, there was this certain American Gothic eariness to what they did, this undercurrent of sadness and tragedy.
*26:17.560- 26:23.620* :  If you look at songs like I Can Never Go Home anymore, it's a song of regret about being cruel to her dead mother.
*26:24.400- 26:32.100* :  Perhaps the strangest past, present and future Mary alludes to some unspecified trauma which means she's unable to love.
*26:38.740- 26:44.160* :  And they made several of what was known as death discs in their breakthrough hit remember walking in the sand.
*26:44.840- 26:47.700* :  Mary's reminiscing about a boyfriend who's dead.
*27:01.220- 27:07.820* :  And their first number one leader of the pack is about her fiance dying in a motorcycle crash, complete with sound effects.
*27:07.820- 27:12.300* :  There was this whole craze for death discs in the 60s, but the Shangri-La's did a better than anyone.
*27:12.360- 27:15.900* :  I think Mary's voice brought this kind of shrill melodrama to those songs.
*27:15.940- 27:20.860* :  People talk about teen pop and yeah, the Shangri-La's music was written by older people.
*27:20.860- 27:27.860* :  But they were genuine teenagers. Mary was 15 when they started having hits and they were from Queens in New York.
*27:27.900- 27:29.840* :  And they brought this kind of attitude to what they did.
*27:29.840- 27:35.740* :  And that had a direct influence on punk and new wave. Debbie Harry of Blondie was a huge admirer.
*27:35.960- 27:43.180* :  The first ever punk single, New Rose by the Damned, begins with the words, is she really going out with him, which is taken from leader of the pack.
*27:43.180- 27:47.080* :  And Joe Jackson's first hit was actually called, is she really going out with him.
*27:47.380- 27:54.220* :  And then of course you've got the influence on girl groups, because along with other 60s girl groups, such as the Ronets and Supremes,
*27:54.580- 28:03.120* :  the Shangri-La's really paved the way for people like Banana Rama, TLC, Spice Girls, Sugar Babes Girls allowed, and Amy Winehouse is known to have been a big fan.
*28:07.780- 28:14.120* :  Simon Price on Mary Weiss, the lead singer of the Shangri-La's, who's died at the age of 75.
*28:16.040- 28:25.920* :  And finally to the very unusual case of Ariel, a Spaniel, who was found abandoned in the car park of a supermarket in Wales, when she was just 11 weeks old.
*28:26.540- 28:31.480* :  Ariel was born not with four, but with six legs, two of them conjoined.
*28:32.120- 28:38.940* :  Now thanks to well-wishers around the world, almost $20,000 was raised to have the two extra legs removed.
*28:39.500- 28:42.820* :  Arunna Ayenga reports on the dog's progress.
*28:43.920- 28:49.460* :  Ariel, who's captured the hearts of so many, appears to have taken this operation in her stride.
*28:50.020- 28:53.720* :  The six-month-old is now bounding around after surgery on Wednesday.
*28:54.560- 28:59.020* :  Langford Vets in Bristol managed to save all four of Ariel's normal legs.
*28:59.800- 29:01.620* :  Aaron Luchman was one of the surgeons.
*29:02.300- 29:09.000* :  So she actually had a duplication of her pelvis, so she had an extra pelvis with an extra limb.
*29:09.400- 29:15.480* :  On that extra limb, she also had two additional pores, so she was quite remarkable looking.
*29:15.500- 29:25.460* :  Mikey Lawler from Green Acres Animal Rescue in Harvard 3rd West looked after Ariel from the start and organised the crowdfunding to raise money for the operation.
*29:25.840- 29:30.680* :  She's recovered really well. She's been eating, drinking, going out for a walk, spending lots of time with the nurses.
*29:30.680- 29:33.880* :  She's very popular there. They're really, really happy with her recovery.
*29:34.360- 29:38.040* :  Green Acres will be looking for a permanent home for Ariel in the coming months.
*29:38.040- 29:44.540* :  But for now, she's being taken back to her foster family in West Wales for a rest and some doggy treats.
*29:45.580- 29:48.300* :  A happy tale there from Arunna Ayenga.
*29:50.520- 29:54.080* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
