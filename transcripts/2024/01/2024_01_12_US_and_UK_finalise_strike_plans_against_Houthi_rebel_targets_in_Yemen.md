*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:08.740* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.620* :  BBC World Service Podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.260- 00:16.960* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.960- 00:20.920* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:21.120- 00:23.580* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.040* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:49.820- 00:54.900* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:05.200- 01:05.280* :  Let's tell this story.
*01:05.280- 01:08.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:10.840- 01:14.800* :  I'm Janet Jalil, and in the early hours of Friday the 12th of January, these are our
*01:14.800- 01:15.460* :  main stories.
*01:16.000- 01:20.240* :  The British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has held talks with his cabinet to discuss potential
*01:20.240- 01:23.580* :  U.S. and U.K. strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.
*01:24.320- 01:28.820* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says hypocrisy and lies are behind the
*01:28.820- 01:33.400* :  court case of a hage in which his country is accused of committing genocide in Gaza.
*01:34.260- 01:38.920* :  Researchers say they've found the ruins of a vast ancient city in the Ecuadorian Amazon
*01:38.920- 01:41.960* :  that changes everything known about the history of the region.
*01:45.100- 01:50.040* :  Also in this podcast, one of my vendors was selling something else and she said at the
*01:50.040- 01:52.840* :  end of the conversation, I've got a couple of transcripts.
*01:52.840- 01:56.940* :  She thinks they'll sell and I, of course, yes, bring them in because I love friends.
*01:57.740- 02:02.960* :  Twenty-five years after they were thrown in a bin, original scripts from the hit U.S. sitcom
*02:02.960- 02:04.140* :  are up for auction.
*02:08.560- 02:12.900* :  As we record this podcast, expectations are rising that the United States and Britain
*02:12.900- 02:18.820* :  are preparing to carry out airstrikes on Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, possibly in the coming
*02:18.820- 02:19.360* :  hours.
*02:20.060- 02:24.300* :  On Thursday evening, the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak briefed his cabinet as well as
*02:24.300- 02:25.480* :  the leader of the opposition.
*02:26.100- 02:30.540* :  The Times of London newspaper said he dispensed with the usual convention of informing the
*02:30.540- 02:34.220* :  British Parliament because the airstrikes were expected within hours.
*02:34.820- 02:37.540* :  Another briefing has been taking place in Washington.
*02:38.220- 02:42.640* :  In recent days, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have been stepping up attacks on
*02:42.640- 02:47.900* :  commercial vessels in the Red Sea in what they say is a protest against Israel's war in
*02:47.900- 02:48.360* :  Gaza.
*02:48.880- 02:52.740* :  This is despite the deployment of a U.S.-led naval task force in the region.
*02:53.380- 02:58.760* :  On Wednesday, after British and U.S. warships repelled the largest Houthi rebel attack to date,
*02:58.760- 03:04.660* :  the British Defence Minister, Grant Shaps, said he had no doubt whatsoever that Iran was behind
*03:04.660- 03:04.840* :  it.
*03:05.580- 03:09.340* :  We do know that Iran is behind so much of an afraid of the bad things that are happening
*03:09.340- 03:14.280* :  in that region, and there have been reports, I've seen, on social media as well, about
*03:14.280- 03:18.660* :  how Iran are providing effectively the eyes and the ears, the radar systems through
*03:18.660- 03:19.580* :  ships and other things.
*03:19.860- 03:24.260* :  And certainly the equipment to the Houthis who are using it to attack shipping.
*03:25.060- 03:29.060* :  This all comes as a U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, wrapped up his latest Middle
*03:29.060- 03:32.520* :  East tour aimed at stopping the conflict there escalating.
*03:33.160- 03:37.520* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, our U.S. State Department correspondent Tom Bateman
*03:37.560- 03:38.680* :  gave us this update.
*03:39.280- 03:43.220* :  The last 48 hours I think have seen a sense that something is imminent.
*03:43.220- 03:47.900* :  That's come from both sides of the Atlantic, but particularly tonight it is because the
*03:48.260- 03:55.040* :  UK government has been meeting virtually in a conference call to discuss this very issue
*03:55.040- 03:57.340* :  about Yemen, the call in opposition leaders.
*03:57.760- 04:02.200* :  And now the Pentagon in the last couple of hours, Major General Patrick Ryder, the spokesman
*04:02.200- 04:06.080* :  there, was asked repeatedly about whether something was imminent.
*04:06.180- 04:10.780* :  He said he wasn't going to speculate, but he repeated the message that we've heard multiple
*04:10.780- 04:16.400* :  times over the last two days now that they say there will be consequences for the Houthis
*04:16.520- 04:18.700* :  over these attacks in the Red Sea.
*04:18.960- 04:23.220* :  And this has really become an issue over the last fortnight in particular because we
*04:23.220- 04:28.640* :  have this lethal moment just before the turn of the new year when there was an attempt
*04:28.640- 04:34.960* :  by the Houthis, according to the U.S. account, to hijack a container ship, a U.S. attack,
*04:34.960- 04:40.040* :  then sunk three fastboats, belonged to Houthis, killing ten of the militiamen according
*04:40.040- 04:41.480* :  to the group itself.
*04:41.620- 04:46.540* :  They said in response to that, on Tuesday this week they launched this wave of drugs
*04:46.540- 04:50.240* :  on its own and ballistic and cruise missile attacks against shipping in the Red Sea.
*04:50.260- 04:54.780* :  And it was after that that we had particularly the U.S. and the UK warning that there would
*04:54.780- 04:55.520* :  be consequences.
*04:56.140- 04:57.420* :  And what are the likely targets?
*04:57.420- 04:58.420* :  How would this work?
*04:58.700- 05:02.500* :  Well, I think what will be significant if there is an attack on land that hasn't happened
*05:02.500- 05:05.620* :  so far, particularly against Houthi bases.
*05:06.380- 05:10.740* :  Now the key issue for the U.S. here is we've had over the last week, Secretary of State
*05:10.740- 05:17.820* :  Anthony Blinken, touring the region, his fourth official tour visit since the October 7th
*05:18.180- 05:18.520* :  attacks.
*05:18.940- 05:22.740* :  And one of the key messages has remained they don't want an escalation.
*05:23.260- 05:29.020* :  And yet it seems we are on the verge of a western-based U.S. led attack, possibly against
*05:29.020- 05:30.720* :  Houthi infrastructure in Yemen.
*05:31.060- 05:35.220* :  Tom Bateman, with more on the risks that the West faces in carrying out strikes on the
*05:35.220- 05:38.200* :  Houthi rebels, he is our security correspondent Frank Garner.
*05:38.920- 05:42.300* :  All these warnings were meant to scare the Houthis into stopping their attacks.
*05:42.820- 05:43.600* :  That hasn't worked.
*05:43.600- 05:45.700* :  So if they don't do anything, then the West looks weak.
*05:45.980- 05:50.960* :  What is the point in having a great big U.S. led armada down in the Red Sea with guided
*05:50.960- 05:54.260* :  missile destroyers and aircraft carrier if it doesn't do anything?
*05:54.760- 06:00.040* :  But if they do hit the Houthi positions, then there is the risk that this will be portrayed
*06:00.040- 06:04.800* :  through the Middle East as the U.S. and Britain and their allies joining in the Gaza
*06:04.800- 06:06.440* :  war on Israel's side.
*06:07.040- 06:08.860* :  And it will be portrayed as such.
*06:09.100- 06:10.580* :  People will die almost certainly.
*06:11.120- 06:12.880* :  And they will be called martyrs.
*06:12.920- 06:14.980* :  It will play very well domestically at home.
*06:15.460- 06:19.440* :  The risk for governments in the region is that this could generate popular unrest.
*06:20.060- 06:25.940* :  And it could ignite and metastasize the entire Middle East tension into something much
*06:25.940- 06:26.600* :  bigger than it was.
*06:26.600- 06:28.700* :  That's why they've been hesitating up until now.
*06:29.380- 06:33.940* :  Frank Garner, with Britain expected to join the U.S. in conducting air strikes and military
*06:33.940- 06:38.480* :  positions belonging to the Iranian-Bat Houthi rebels in Yemen, our political editor,
*06:38.480- 06:43.020* :  Chris Mason, told us more about the British Prime Minister, Rishisunak, specially convened
*06:43.020- 06:43.820* :  Cabinet meeting.
*06:44.440- 06:48.740* :  That Cabinet call was a conference call in which it would appear.
*06:48.740- 06:54.260* :  The Prime Minister was briefing the Cabinet on the prospect of UK military action that
*06:54.260- 06:57.980* :  will be imminent in and around the Red Sea.
*06:57.980- 07:04.860* :  Shortly after that Cabinet call, we saw in-person arriving on foot John Healey, the shadow defence
*07:04.860- 07:09.780* :  secretary for Labour, and also Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the leader of the commons arriving.
*07:09.780- 07:15.000* :  We also saw the Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, going into Downing Street.
*07:15.000- 07:19.480* :  And the expectation in situations like this where time allows is that senior opposition
*07:19.480- 07:24.560* :  figures, such as Keir Starmer, who we think has probably joined a call to be briefed
*07:24.620- 07:30.320* :  as well as the shadow defence secretary and the commons speaker, would be briefed.
*07:30.540- 07:36.960* :  The UK Government always has the capacity to respond without consulting either the opposition
*07:37.020- 07:42.040* :  or wider Parliament, but convention would normally point in the direction of that happening
*07:42.440- 07:43.080* :  when it could.
*07:43.600- 07:49.560* :  The fact that that has happened paints a pretty clear picture, I think, that we can expect
*07:49.560- 07:56.600* :  UK involvement in military strikes against the Houthis, imminently, if the UK, alongside
*07:56.600- 07:59.440* :  its allies, determines that those strikes should happen.
*07:59.840- 08:03.880* :  If we take a little bit of a step back, there is real concern, and there has been concern
*08:03.880- 08:08.860* :  for some time about the impact on commercial shipping through the Red Sea, which was the
*08:09.120- 08:11.520* :  concern about how dangerous that passage had become.
*08:11.520- 08:16.280* :  The additional costs that are associated with boats travelling all the way around the
*08:16.280- 08:23.100* :  base of Africa to complete the same journey, as well as obvious concerns at every level,
*08:23.100- 08:29.500* :  whether it be military, diplomatic, economic, of any escalation in conflict in the Middle
*08:29.500- 08:35.360* :  East with the nocons, huge nocons that that could have in the region, but much more widely
*08:36.440- 08:37.720* :  economically as well.
*08:38.500- 08:39.020* :  Chris Mason.
*08:39.700- 08:44.680* :  Israel's Prime Minister has described accusations of genocide against his government as being
*08:44.680- 08:46.960* :  based on hypocrisy and lies.
*08:47.520- 08:52.560* :  Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking after South Africa, whose ANC government has long supported
*08:52.560- 08:57.940* :  the Palestinian cause, outlined its case to the UN's top court, alleging that Israel's
*08:57.940- 09:00.500* :  military offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide.
*09:01.280- 09:05.620* :  Mr Netanyahu said listening to the first day of arguments in the Hague was like being in
*09:05.620- 09:06.780* :  an upside down world.
*09:07.340- 09:12.960* :  He insisted that his country was, in fact, battling genocide by Hamas after the massacres
*09:12.960- 09:14.260* :  of October 7th.
*09:14.720- 09:21.380* :  A terrorist organization committed the most terrible crime against the Jewish people since
*09:21.380- 09:26.460* :  the Holocaust, and now there are those who come to defend it in the name of the Holocaust.
*09:27.160- 09:28.260* :  What audacity?
*09:29.000- 09:29.380* :  A fool.
*09:30.500- 09:34.000* :  But lawyers from South Africa told the International Court of Justice in the Hague that
*09:34.000- 09:36.960* :  Israel was acting with genocidal intent.
*09:37.680- 09:43.520* :  According to Hamas officials, the war has killed 1% of the population of Gaza in three months.
*09:44.140- 09:49.460* :  The South African Justice Minister, Ronald Lamola, accused Israel of intentionally unleashing
*09:49.460- 09:52.340* :  suffering on civilians in the Gaza Strip.
*09:52.460- 09:57.500* :  The world has watched in horror as Palestinian men, women and children were slaughtered, blown
*09:57.500- 10:03.580* :  up, buried alive, under the rubble of their homes, left to die painful deaths and in unresolved
*10:03.580- 10:09.340* :  hospitals, resulting in over 23,000 deaths through destruction to homes, schools, hospitals,
*10:10.060- 10:12.740* :  water, treatment plans and other public infrastructure.
*10:13.880- 10:18.300* :  The Genocide Convention was enacted in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust.
*10:19.020- 10:25.020* :  It defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
*10:25.440- 10:27.540* :  ethnical, racial or religious group.
*10:28.140- 10:32.360* :  A diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, considers whether South Africa will be able to prove
*10:32.360- 10:35.660* :  that Israel's offensive in Gaza meets that threshold.
*10:36.360- 10:41.240* :  The last three months have been shocking enough, but to hear it all summed up by South Africa's
*10:41.240- 10:42.840* :  lawyers is still devastating.
*10:43.460- 10:46.840* :  How many wonder can this not be a story of genocide?
*10:47.700- 10:53.040* :  But the 1948 definition, which so accurately describes the horrors of the Holocaust that
*10:53.040- 10:56.760* :  had so recently ended, is an incredibly high bar to clear.
*10:57.240- 11:00.440* :  The South African team knows it has a legal mountain to climb.
*11:00.960- 11:05.540* :  There has to be evidence of intent by those responsible for Israel's military campaign,
*11:06.140- 11:10.660* :  and there has to be a pattern of behavior by its troops, which cannot reasonably be explained
*11:10.660- 11:12.900* :  as anything other than genocidal.
*11:13.700- 11:14.780* :  Israel will make its case.
*11:15.120- 11:20.800* :  Its high-powered delegation includes Aharon Barak, Israel's former chief justice and himself
*11:21.120- 11:22.240* :  a Holocaust survivor.
*11:22.700- 11:26.980* :  The implication, perhaps, Israel understands the true face of genocide.
*11:27.960- 11:32.060* :  It'll be three or four years before the court decides whether Israel is guilty, but
*11:32.060- 11:36.540* :  much sooner than that, perhaps within weeks, it could demand that Israel halt its military
*11:36.540- 11:40.800* :  campaign to avoid inflicting further harm on Palestinian civilians.
*11:41.380- 11:46.620* :  Israel determined to pursue its goal of destroying Hamas as a political and military force
*11:46.900- 11:49.220* :  would almost certainly ignore the court's ruling.
*11:49.720- 11:55.420* :  There's nothing the ICJ can do to enforce it, but a judgment by the UN's top legal authority
*11:55.420- 12:00.560* :  could add to the pressure mounting on Israel to change the way it acts in Gaza.
*12:01.240- 12:01.720* :  Paul Adams.
*12:02.240- 12:04.360* :  Many of those killed in Gaza have been children.
*12:04.600- 12:08.940* :  The Hamas-run health ministry says 40% of those who've died have been under the age of
*12:08.940- 12:09.260* :  18.
*12:10.020- 12:13.800* :  But even before the current war, those growing up in Gaza had lived through multiple
*12:13.800- 12:16.880* :  rounds of fighting between Palestinian armed groups in Israel.
*12:17.700- 12:22.460* :  Back in 2021, the BBC reported on a girl called Nadine Abdul Latif.
*12:23.000- 12:27.980* :  Now 13, she's become a popular vlogger and has been describing how during this conflict,
*12:27.980- 12:32.520* :  her brother was killed during an Israeli air strike and her family forced from their home.
*12:32.700- 12:35.480* :  Here's our BBC Middle East correspondent, you're landed now.
*12:38.040- 12:39.820* :  That is the sound we hear every night.
*12:40.140- 12:40.840* :  Did you hear that?
*12:41.120- 12:46.800* :  Hunker down in her apartment, this was an Instagram video by Nadine Abdul Latif in the early days
*12:46.800- 12:47.420* :  of the war.
*13:00.360- 13:06.060* :  She filmed her world being shattered. Her neighborhood of Gaza city pounded by Israeli bombs.
*13:12.600- 13:17.240* :  Soon, like hundreds of thousands of others, she was forced to flee towards the south.
*13:17.860- 13:24.140* :  We've left our houses three times, from Gaza to Lusta to Lusta to Rafa.
*13:24.560- 13:28.340* :  Now Nadine tells me of her own terrible loss in this war.
*13:28.720- 13:32.420* :  Losing my brother was the worst moment of my life.
*13:33.000- 13:36.120* :  I mean, he was my dear brother, he was everything that I loved.
*13:36.960- 13:40.440* :  He was always by my side, we would always go out together.
*13:45.900- 13:51.980* :  During a previous conflict in 2021, school was cancelled and Nadine began making videos
*13:51.980- 13:53.080* :  for social media.
*13:53.640- 13:58.140* :  One clip of her, distraught by the rubble of her neighbour's house, went viral.
*13:58.980- 14:00.740* :  I don't know what to do, I'm just 10.
*14:02.300- 14:03.040* :  I'm just 10.
*14:04.600- 14:10.760* :  Children stand all day and wait for them to be able to get water for their family.
*14:11.960- 14:16.520* :  Again, during the three long months of this war, Nadine's been showing the trauma and
*14:16.520- 14:21.560* :  struggle for children, who make up half of the 2.3 million people in Gaza.
*14:22.160- 14:25.840* :  I saw these two children selling cans of food in the ring.
*14:26.320- 14:28.960* :  They might get sick, but this is our way.
*14:29.540- 14:31.620* :  And there are the daily indignities.
*14:32.400- 14:36.600* :  As you guys can see, I'm still in the same clothes because there is no water, I can't take
*14:36.600- 14:37.120* :  a shower.
*14:37.940- 14:42.600* :  Nadine's long hoped to be a doctor, but now she can barely contemplate the future.
*14:43.100- 14:44.920* :  It's not living anymore, just existing.
*14:45.800- 14:49.740* :  We don't have hopes anymore, we don't go to school, we don't do anything, we just
*14:50.220- 14:52.360* :  sit here and watch and do the stuff.
*14:53.240- 14:55.900* :  It just exists, and that is horrible.
*14:57.540- 14:59.660* :  Every day feels dangerous in Gaza.
*15:00.320- 15:05.840* :  And with so much grief and devastation, even when the violence stops, its young generation
*15:05.840- 15:09.220* :  will find it hard to pick up the pieces of their lives.
*15:10.460- 15:11.340* :  Yolanda Nell.
*15:12.100- 15:17.600* :  The former US President Donald Trump has reiterated his belief that his civil fraud case is a political
*15:17.600- 15:20.680* :  witch hunt on the closing day of the trial in New York.
*15:21.320- 15:25.920* :  Mr. Trump has already been found guilty of inflating the value of his properties to secure
*15:26.320- 15:26.980* :  favourable loans.
*15:27.480- 15:32.520* :  The trial is looking at other counts such as conspiracy and falsification of business records.
*15:33.180- 15:37.160* :  An ortho-american correspondent needed to effect this report from outside the court.
*15:38.280- 15:41.680* :  In court, Donald Trump's lawyer echoed the former president's claims.
*15:41.680- 15:46.620* :  Chris Keiss said the case had been manufactured for political reasons, and that the attorney
*15:46.620- 15:49.540* :  general was trying to put Mr. Trump out of business.
*15:49.920- 15:54.760* :  He argued that the accusations didn't make sense, because Deutsche Bank had rolled out
*15:54.760- 15:59.200* :  the red carpet to give Mr. Trump loans, that he didn't need to inflate the worth of
*15:59.200- 16:01.740* :  his assets and the loans were paid back.
*16:02.040- 16:06.360* :  The judge has banned Mr. Trump from addressing the court himself, because he's failed to
*16:06.360- 16:08.380* :  agree to limits on what he could say.
*16:08.760- 16:11.160* :  So the former president made a statement outside.
*16:11.160- 16:13.320* :  So which hunt in the true sense of the word?
*16:13.320- 16:19.680* :  It's election interference, and so it's all a conspiracy to try and get Biden who can't
*16:19.680- 16:22.900* :  put two sentences together, trying to get him into office.
*16:22.900- 16:27.180* :  So I just want to let you know that we have our best poll numbers, we have the best everything
*16:27.180- 16:31.540* :  despite this, and maybe because of this, because the people of the United States, all
*16:31.540- 16:35.280* :  of those people back there, but the people of the United States really get it.
*16:35.280- 16:37.300* :  They get it better than anybody else.
*16:37.300- 16:39.640* :  Judge has previously disagreed with the defense.
*16:39.740- 16:44.040* :  He said lenders could have been damaged by lending at a lower interest rate than they
*16:44.040- 16:47.380* :  would have if Mr. Trump's assets had been valued correctly.
*16:47.940- 16:52.360* :  Prosecutors argue that the former president used a myriad of deceptive schemes that were
*16:52.360- 16:57.480* :  so outrageous, they belied innocent explanation, the judge will issue a verdict at a later
*16:57.480- 16:57.780* :  date.
*16:58.580- 17:03.800* :  Nitorthic, now to the tiny unspoilt Caribbean island of Barbuda.
*17:04.120- 17:08.380* :  Some residents there fear that the arrival of new multi-million dollar tourist results
*17:08.380- 17:12.300* :  and an international airport will threaten their culture and way of life.
*17:12.780- 17:15.460* :  Others see them as bringing much needed jobs and development.
*17:16.080- 17:20.960* :  Caroline Bailey has been to Barbuda, the smaller of the two islands state of Antigua and
*17:20.960- 17:24.560* :  Barbuda, to find out what the future holds for this island paradise.
*17:25.540- 17:31.100* :  From a beautiful pink sandy beach, environmentalist John Mussington points out two private
*17:31.100- 17:33.880* :  resorts at either end of Barbuda's southern coast.
*17:34.400- 17:38.880* :  It's known as the Barbuda Ocean Club and they're building hundreds of multi-million dollar
*17:38.880- 17:40.700* :  residences and a golf course.
*17:41.080- 17:47.260* :  Luxury properties are built, golf courses are going to be built, sale of these luxury properties
*17:47.260- 17:51.100* :  and put them behind fence for persons living private lifestyle.
*17:51.100- 17:57.200* :  It will mean large areas of resources we depend on for livelihood will no longer be available
*17:57.200- 17:57.780* :  to us.
*17:58.540- 18:03.380* :  John is worried about the environmental impact as the larger of the two resorts is within
*18:03.380- 18:08.880* :  an area declared by the Intergovernmental Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international
*18:09.860- 18:09.880* :  significance.
*18:10.360- 18:16.200* :  The developers leading the project, the American firms PLH Barbuda Limited and the Discovery
*18:16.200- 18:22.000* :  Land Company, declined our request for an interview but said in a statement that the project
*18:22.000- 18:28.140* :  was approved in a transparent and inclusive process and that they're doing a lot of environmental
*18:28.140- 18:34.080* :  work including restoring wetlands and also that they've created hundreds of jobs for Barbuda.
*18:35.460- 18:40.700* :  But John has taken the government to court over another aspect of the project, the construction
*18:40.700- 18:45.720* :  of an airport in the middle of the island which he says is in an environmentally sensitive
*18:46.300- 18:46.320* :  area.
*18:47.020- 18:53.300* :  No problem, environmental impact assessment was done when an impact assessment turned
*18:53.300- 18:57.720* :  up the review by the Department of Environment said it was totally inadequate.
*18:58.540- 19:03.680* :  The case has been heard at the Privy Council in London, Antiga and Barbuda's highest court.
*19:04.240- 19:08.760* :  If John wins, he'll have the right that's been denied to him to challenge the project
*19:08.760- 19:13.720* :  and call for a judicial review where a judge would look at the lawfulness of the process.
*19:14.260- 19:19.860* :  But others, like local businesswoman Kelcina George, who runs Barbuda cottages, see
*19:19.860- 19:22.840* :  the high end resorts as good for the island's economy.
*19:23.300- 19:29.540* :  They've hired a lot of Barbudans, all the young people, everyone went to work there and
*19:29.540- 19:32.680* :  from what I gather they're pretty happy with the money.
*19:33.820- 19:37.180* :  And that's what the government based in Antiga says is the priority.
*19:37.840- 19:40.720* :  Charles Fernandez is the tourism and investment minister.
*19:41.360- 19:48.280* :  Well, I think it's a vision of the government to bring Barbuda to a level where it has
*19:48.800- 19:49.500* :  full employment.
*19:49.540- 19:55.400* :  Barbuda is going to generate when it's fully operational, it's going to generate a
*19:55.400- 19:56.800* :  tremendous amount in taxes.
*19:59.340- 20:00.700* :  Barbuda is not alone.
*20:01.260- 20:06.400* :  Around the world there are similar battles taking place as small paradise communities in
*20:06.400- 20:11.920* :  beautiful locations, attempt to balance economic need against protecting their own cultures.
*20:12.760- 20:16.060* :  Caroline Bailey reporting from the Caribbean island of Barbuda.
*20:18.820- 20:24.240* :  Sultacom, scientists use both excavations and ground penetrating lasers to find these
*20:24.240- 20:27.680* :  vast remains in the Amazonian rainforest in Eastern Ecuador.
*20:28.220- 20:32.880* :  The huge ancient city believed to have been built two and a half thousand years ago.
*20:36.820- 20:39.980* :  Some people play golf on the weekends, I hunt con artists.
*20:40.360- 20:43.300* :  Unmissable podcasts from the BBC World Service.
*20:43.620- 20:47.740* :  Our county mayor or great team belated by mystical forces we can't comprehend.
*20:48.040- 20:48.940* :  I believe in the curse.
*20:49.220- 20:52.020* :  I think it's real telling stories from around the globe.
*20:52.260- 20:55.340* :  Every minute there's bombing and shutting, there is no safety.
*20:55.600- 20:58.300* :  If I get any internet connection, I'll talk to you again.
*20:58.520- 21:03.880* :  Search for a live less ordinary, amazing sport stories and the documentary wherever you get
*21:03.880- 21:04.900* :  your BBC podcasts.
*21:05.560- 21:07.700* :  You better be ready, because we're not a brand to you.
*21:09.160- 21:10.940* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*21:11.760- 21:16.220* :  Tens of thousands of opposition supporters have held an anti-government demonstration
*21:16.220- 21:18.160* :  in the Polish capital Warsaw.
*21:18.740- 21:23.140* :  The rally outside Parliament was called by the Law and Justice Party, which lost elections
*21:23.140- 21:24.160* :  last October.
*21:24.380- 21:29.720* :  The demonstrators were protesting against the new government's imprisonment of two former ministers
*21:30.140- 21:34.620* :  who've been convicted of abusing their powers when they headed an anti-corruption agency.
*21:35.360- 21:39.320* :  President Anjay Duda had pardoned the men for the crimes in 2015,
*21:39.980- 21:42.900* :  but last year the Supreme Court ruled the pardon was invalid,
*21:43.440- 21:44.780* :  something the president disputes.
*21:45.460- 21:51.460* :  As Adam Eastern reports from Warsaw, he's now started the process to once again pardon the two men.
*21:55.760- 22:00.940* :  Tusk, to prison the demonstrators chanted, they mean Donald Tusk, the country's new prime minister
*22:00.940- 22:04.860* :  and political enemy number one of opposition law and justice supporters.
*22:05.760- 22:10.060* :  Many of them are angry about the way Mr Tusk has started undoing the controversial reforms of
*22:10.060- 22:14.040* :  the law and justice government that recently lost power after eight years in office.
*22:16.060- 22:22.260* :  I am a poll and I think what's happening harms Poland and is illegal, above all,
*22:22.700- 22:27.560* :  taking over public television and imprisoning people who have parliamentary immunity
*22:28.260- 22:30.480* :  and forcing the president to pardon them again.
*22:30.920- 22:35.280* :  She's talking about Mariusz Kaminsky and Maché von Schick, who were convicted last month
*22:35.280- 22:38.480* :  of abusing their powers when they led an anti-corruption agency.
*22:38.920- 22:42.200* :  After a court ordered police to take them into custody earlier this week,
*22:42.580- 22:46.120* :  they briefly sheltered in the presidential palace at President Duda's invitation.
*22:47.120- 22:51.780* :  President Duda refused to recognize the court ruling, saying he'd already pardon the men for
*22:51.780- 22:57.800* :  the crimes, but his original pardon was legally disputed. As the men said they were starting a
*22:57.800- 23:02.640* :  hunger strike in prison, President Duda said he would issue a fresh pardon to allow them to
*23:02.640- 23:08.700* :  be released. Adam Easton impolined. The jailed Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny,
*23:08.700- 23:14.180* :  has long complained of the harsh treatment he receives in prison, being frequently put in
*23:14.180- 23:19.900* :  a punishment cell, being denied access to medical treatment and even attempts to poison him.
*23:20.440- 23:24.720* :  So his supporters were alarmed when he disappeared for several weeks at the end of last year.
*23:25.340- 23:29.600* :  They eventually tracked him to a remote penal colony in the Russian Arctic.
*23:30.200- 23:34.880* :  This week, in his first public appearance since then, he sold a Supreme Court judge by video
*23:34.880- 23:39.920* :  link that he should be allowed access to proper meal breaks and more books in prison.
*23:44.540- 23:49.320* :  You come right set that I have 10 books and there are religious books among those 10 books.
*23:49.340- 23:54.820* :  I need two books for their constant practice of my religion. My religion is orthodox
*23:54.820- 24:01.080* :  Christianity and any representative of the orthodox religion will tell you that more than one book
*24:01.080- 24:07.080* :  is needed for daily practice. One book is not enough for me. This violates my religious rights.
*24:07.080- 24:14.440* :  It violates my rights to study. I asked a Russian analyst with Tali Shivchenko how Mr Navalny appeared
*24:14.440- 24:21.100* :  during the court hearing. Well, he looked haggard, which is not surprising given the circumstances,
*24:21.100- 24:29.380* :  but also both when he appeared via video link from his Arctic colony on Wednesday and today on
*24:29.380- 24:35.800* :  Thursday. He looked upbeat, he was smiling, he made some jokes which of course will be a source
*24:35.800- 24:44.260* :  of inspiration to his followers and supporters and also it will ease the concerns and fears which
*24:44.260- 24:52.140* :  emerged after Mr Navalny disappeared in early December and none of his lawyers and supporters
*24:52.140- 25:01.340* :  knew where he was. So his back he is reasonably well as far as we can tell. He is able to
*25:02.220- 25:12.500* :  continue to argue his cases in court. So today his case was focused on prison rules such as
*25:12.860- 25:22.500* :  the limit on the number of books inmates can have in their cells and also he complained against
*25:22.620- 25:30.260* :  a prison rule which said that you have only a certain amount of time to consume your hot meals
*25:30.880- 25:37.380* :  and according to him that amount of time in practical terms was usually reduced to 15 minutes
*25:37.380- 25:42.800* :  and he said that inmates burned themselves because they were in such a hurry to eat their meals
*25:43.160- 25:51.120* :  and unsurprisingly those complaints were rejected. So he's been able to achieve very little with
*25:51.120- 25:58.640* :  his cases but at least he's trying. And he's also showing them that he remains defiant that the
*25:58.640- 26:03.940* :  Russian authorities and these draconian conditions that he's been kept in have not broken him.
*26:04.180- 26:10.520* :  Which I suppose is the reason why he was sent to jail in the first place. Mr Navalny is
*26:10.520- 26:19.700* :  arguably Russia's most active, prominent and effective a position figure and now he's in jail
*26:19.700- 26:27.740* :  which means that President Putin is the only man on the top who will be able to run for re-election
*26:27.740- 26:36.500* :  later this year all of his effective and credible opponents are either in jail such as Mr
*26:36.500- 26:44.860* :  Navalny or in exile such as almost all of Mr Navalny's supporters or dead such as Boris Niyomsov
*26:44.860- 26:50.800* :  who was shot dead outside the Kremlin. Vitaly Shevchenko. The Thai government says it will continue
*26:50.800- 26:55.340* :  to allow a former prime minister who's supposed to be in jail to serve his sentence in hospital.
*26:55.340- 27:01.420* :  Officials said tax in Shinowat still needed close medical attention. Mickey Bristol reports.
*27:02.200- 27:06.260* :  The billionaire businessman was initially sent to prison when he returned to Thailand from
*27:06.260- 27:12.680* :  self-imposed exile last August. The 74-year-old was almost immediately transferred to hospital
*27:12.680- 27:19.460* :  complaining of tightness in his chest. The government run by a political party linked to Mr Taxin
*27:19.900- 27:24.440* :  says he can stay at the luxury medical facility just in case he needs treatment
*27:24.540- 27:29.980* :  a former PM is serving a one-year jail term and is eligible for parole next month
*27:30.340- 27:36.520* :  so he might never see the inside of a prison cell again. Mickey Bristol. Now cast your mind back
*27:36.520- 27:42.060* :  to some of the supply chain problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. A key concern was the availability
*27:42.060- 27:47.760* :  of semi-conductors. Those computer chips so vital for many of our electronic items. Well since
*27:47.760- 27:53.180* :  the pandemic, geopolitical tensions have also affected this industry with 90% of the world's
*27:53.220- 28:00.260* :  most advanced chips made by TSMC in Taiwan. So it will come as no surprise that countries all
*28:00.260- 28:04.900* :  over the world are now investing billions of dollars to try to make their own supply.
*28:05.540- 28:09.460* :  Hannah Malayne visited a new factory near the city of Durham in Northern England.
*28:09.460- 28:14.820* :  There she met David Moore, the chief executive of the Pragmatic semi-conductor company.
*28:15.480- 28:20.700* :  We get started? Yeah, let's start it. Okay. Let's go to this way. First I had to put my safety gear on.
*28:22.580- 28:25.100* :  Does it matter that I can't put my helmet on my head with these headphones?
*28:25.560- 28:31.760* :  Um, you should get me a very large one. After we managed to find a helmet big enough to
*28:31.760- 28:38.960* :  accommodate my head and my headphones, we were ready to go. Well welcome again. So this is Pragmatic Park.
*28:39.640- 28:45.560* :  This is Pragmatic's newest manufacturing site for flexible integrated circuit technologies.
*28:46.400- 28:55.820* :  So unlike silicon, we make what is a ultra thin, very flexible, low-cost, sustainable alternative
*28:56.340- 29:00.720* :  to those silicon chips. These are essentially eight inches wide and so they got a certain number
*29:00.720- 29:05.260* :  of chips to it. You can see the tiny little rectangles there. Each of those is a chip.
*29:06.760- 29:11.720* :  And so what's really special about it is that it's flexible. Yeah, and I'm feeling it and it feels like
*29:11.980- 29:16.960* :  the kind of film I might wrap a Christmas gift in. Yes, yes, you could. It's a really, really, really...
*29:16.960- 29:19.560* :  Right, right, for those really nerdy family members who want...
*29:21.040- 29:25.840* :  So we can talk to you about Christmas gifts. No, absolutely. It is, it is, I mean, ultimately what's
*29:25.960- 29:31.280* :  laid on is essentially what's called polymide. It's a facioplastic. This is like a big dinner plate
*29:31.280- 29:37.920* :  and a small side plate, in terms of size. It just feels crazy to think that there is so many
*29:37.920- 29:43.440* :  chips in that. It can be used in tech. It doesn't feel like tech when I look at it. It doesn't feel
*29:43.440- 29:47.900* :  like... Absolutely. So metal things going into phones and things like that. Exactly, exactly.
*29:47.900- 29:52.720* :  It's quite a different thing to see in person. It's extremely unique. So that thin film technology
*29:52.800- 29:58.120* :  enables it obviously to be flexible and really thin. So a silicon chip in your cell phone or
*29:58.120- 30:04.220* :  your laptop, they have their role to play, but if you want to be able to embed these into products
*30:04.820- 30:09.320* :  that need to be flexible and integrated into smart packaging and those applications,
*30:09.940- 30:14.440* :  that kind of flexible thin form factor is a really unique thing.
*30:15.520- 30:20.000* :  It's the flexible nature of these chips, which means they can't be used in all the same places
*30:20.300- 30:24.700* :  that you might find the silicon kind. It's more likely that we'll see them in wearable health
*30:24.700- 30:30.800* :  technology for clothing authentication and impartial labels to track and trace items. And for such
*30:30.800- 30:40.560* :  tiny items, you really need a huge space to make them. It's pretty big, isn't it? This is a 16,000
*30:40.560- 30:47.740* :  square meter building. Obviously it's got a feel of a very industrial kind of facility to it
*30:47.940- 30:56.080* :  and it actually is a formerly was a ceramic pipe factory. And so it's large. On a 15 acre site,
*30:56.080- 31:03.760* :  we've got the 16,000 square meters. Ultimately, the secret behind this is the ability to be able to
*31:04.240- 31:09.760* :  take what is just, you know, a general site here in the northeast and be able to put
*31:10.200- 31:16.220* :  semiconductor manufacturing into it. But if you take a standard silicon manufacturing facility,
*31:16.860- 31:23.120* :  first of all, they're going to be gigantic. So many times the size of this, it's going to take
*31:23.120- 31:29.300* :  multiple years and billions of dollars. Typically two silicon fabs will require a huge amount
*31:29.300- 31:36.520* :  of energy. So TSMC, for example, uses 5% of Taiwan's total energy supply every year. They use
*31:36.940- 31:42.700* :  hundreds and hundreds of millions of liters of water. They use very kind of complex chemicals
*31:43.860- 31:49.760* :  because of our unique processing. It's ultimately more simple and that makes it, you know,
*31:49.760- 31:55.100* :  fundamentally more sustainable. David Moore, the chief executive of Pragmatic,
*31:55.100- 32:01.660* :  talking to Hannah Malayne. A huge ancient city has been found in the eastern Amazon.
*32:02.040- 32:07.440* :  Scientists had previously thought that large settlements were only in highland areas of South
*32:07.900- 32:15.640* :  America like Machu Picchu in Peru. Georgina Ranad reports. Scientists used both excavations and
*32:15.640- 32:21.020* :  ground penetrating lasers to find these vast remains in the Amazonian rainforests in eastern
*32:21.020- 32:26.420* :  Ecuador. They believed they were built two and a half thousand years ago. The city had around
*32:26.420- 32:32.140* :  6,000 mounds of platforms that made up homes and places to conduct ceremonies. They were connected
*32:32.140- 32:37.660* :  by many kilometers of long, straight roads. Little is known about the people who lived there,
*32:37.660- 32:42.220* :  except that they were farmers and their diet included sweet potatoes and sweet beer.
*32:42.620- 32:47.620* :  It's not known why this civilization ended, but eruptions from a nearby volcano probably
*32:47.620- 32:55.800* :  played a part. Georgina Ranad. Original scripts from two episodes of the hit US sitcom Friends
*32:55.840- 33:01.820* :  are going up for auction, 25 years after they were found in a bin. The scripts were meant to be
*33:01.820- 33:06.740* :  destroyed to stop details of a season finale leaking out before it was broadcast, but a worker
*33:06.740- 33:12.480* :  on the set rescued them and has kept them in a bedside drawer all these years. Their value has been
*33:12.480- 33:17.960* :  estimated at about a thousand dollars, but as Joe Black reports, they could sell for much more.
*33:23.680- 33:27.460* :  The scripts belong to one of Friends' most famous episodes,
*33:28.960- 33:34.560* :  which entertained millions in the 90s and early 90s. In it, Ross is marrying his British
*33:34.560- 33:41.420* :  fiancée Emily, but he messes up his wedding vows and says, I take the Rachel, the name of his
*33:41.420- 33:46.520* :  on-off girlfriend throughout the series, drawing gasps of horror from the assembled guests.
*33:47.220- 33:51.680* :  What have we got here? So, two Friends' scripts, the one with Ross's wedding,
*33:51.680- 33:56.660* :  filmlet, fainting studios and central London. Some of these scenes were filmed in London,
*33:57.120- 34:02.020* :  and now the scripts, which were originally found in a bin after filming, have been discovered
*34:02.020- 34:08.580* :  25 years on. They'll go under the hammer. Amanda Butler is from Hanson Ross, which is holding
*34:08.580- 34:13.880* :  the auction. One of my vendors was selling something else, and she said at the end of the conversation,
*34:14.820- 34:17.560* :  I've got a couple of Friends' scripts, do you think they'll sell? And I, of course,
*34:17.560- 34:22.060* :  yes, bring them in, bring them in, because I love Friends. And she worked at Fainting Studios,
*34:22.500- 34:27.080* :  she found them in a bin, picked them up, took them home, and they'd been in our drawer for 25
*34:27.140- 34:31.460* :  years. The great thing about these scripts is that the casting crew were told to destroy them,
*34:31.500- 34:37.520* :  so that the ending wouldn't be leaked, and they're here. The auction house has received many calls.
*34:44.520- 34:46.020* :  That report by Joe Black.
*34:48.560- 34:52.920* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*34:53.120- 34:56.660* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.
*34:56.660- 35:04.300* :  The address is globalpodcast at BBC.co.uk. You can also find us on X at Global NewsPod.
*35:04.980- 35:08.900* :  This edition was mixed by Chris Ablaquois, the producer was Liam McSheffery,
*35:09.000- 35:13.440* :  the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Janette Joliel. Until next time, goodbye.
