*00:46.260- 00:50.920* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*00:50.920- 00:55.520* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*00:55.520- 01:00.200* :  prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said what the f**k are you
*01:00.200- 01:05.140* :  talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited
*01:05.140- 01:10.600* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*01:19.840- 01:26.880* :  Hi, my name's Hal. I study whales and there's nothing I like more than a happy
*01:26.880- 01:32.260* :  pod. See what we did there. This is the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
*01:36.440- 01:41.200* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday, January the 13th,
*01:41.460- 01:47.580* :  rescuing a family from a flooded cave in Slovenia. It's like a birthday present. Usually we are
*01:47.580- 01:55.460* :  risking one person and then we manage to save five persons in one action. The men who've
*01:55.460- 02:00.020* :  dedicated their lives to protecting lowland gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*02:00.620- 02:08.940* :  from Canada, plans, culture and consensus among sperm whales and working Barcelona to help decode this.
*02:13.900- 02:20.120* :  Also in this podcast, this is my nuts. You're not having any other thing I could think he's
*02:20.120- 02:26.040* :  doing is just enjoying himself on a bit of fun every night. A very tidy mouse.
*02:31.860- 02:38.500* :  And we begin with a rescue in southern Slovenia. On Monday, five people were freed from a cave
*02:38.500- 02:43.780* :  where they had been trapped in Saturday. A family of three adults and their two guides have been
*02:43.780- 02:51.280* :  visiting a chain of underground lakes at the Krzna-Jama cave when water levels rose and blocked
*02:51.280- 02:57.840* :  their way out. This was the moment when Max Marola, a member of Slovenia's cave rescue service,
*02:58.200- 03:01.760* :  spoke to the BBC's James Reynolds right after the rescue was over.
*03:02.440- 03:08.720* :  We just successfully finished the rescue operation. It was almost three days of efforts of our
*03:08.720- 03:15.940* :  cave rescue service team and also the national team for technical cave rescue when we were really
*03:15.940- 03:23.860* :  glad and happy that this scenario was finished in this way. Was it complicated to rescue these five
*03:23.860- 03:31.320* :  people? Yeah, it was very complex rescue operation because it was not just on us. Also,
*03:31.320- 03:37.880* :  the nature has to be positive for this because we had some heavy rain in the last past days and the
*03:37.880- 03:45.960* :  the racing of water actually closed the cave in two parts. So at the end of the end of the
*03:45.960- 03:51.420* :  cave, so these people were trapped inside. So it was technically demanding because cave rescues,
*03:51.420- 03:58.380* :  they had to dive to manage to come to the trapped person. Do you know how the people are at the
*03:58.380- 04:04.360* :  moment? Are they okay? The ones who were rescued? Yes, they were in very good physical condition,
*04:04.360- 04:11.180* :  also psychophysical condition because they had some first aid supplies with nutrition,
*04:12.480- 04:19.820* :  actually water to drink also some heating devices and our first rescue team managed to come
*04:20.140- 04:29.620* :  to their place yesterday and they bring them more things, also some dry clothes. So they came out
*04:29.680- 04:36.660* :  from the cave alone, actually with no medical help and they're completely healthy and everything
*04:36.660- 04:42.920* :  is okay. So very positive. And it sounds like you're pretty happy. What is the mood among your fellow
*04:43.140- 04:52.380* :  rescuers? Yeah, of course, it's like a birthday present. So usually we are risking one person
*04:52.380- 05:00.380* :  and now in this rescue operation, we managed to actually save five persons in one action and it
*05:00.380- 05:06.340* :  was really successful. Of course, you are glad the dose of the weather conditions enabled actually
*05:06.340- 05:12.320* :  the rescue operation because it could last for days or even weeks like it was in the entire story.
*05:13.080- 05:19.300* :  I think our audience would like me to say to you well done on the rescue, Max Merella. Thank
*05:19.300- 05:24.360* :  you, thank you for your service. Thank you very, thank you very much. And we would echo that
*05:24.360- 05:35.860* :  bravo, Max Merella and Slovenia's cave rescue service. Apologies if you are struggling with
*05:35.860- 05:42.220* :  sleepless nights and that sound yourself at the moment but there's been a fascinating development
*05:42.220- 05:49.320* :  from Spain where scientists at the Barcelona hospital clinic think they can decode a baby's cry
*05:49.320- 05:55.580* :  to work out exactly what it is he or she is unhappy about and work is underway to develop
*05:55.580- 06:03.800* :  software to help translate the cry too. This is Dr Anna Lucia Paltiniieri. We recruited 38 healthy
*06:03.800- 06:11.500* :  full-term newborn babies and in a period between the first two weeks we did a recording of their
*06:11.500- 06:17.720* :  voice while they were crying. We did a video recording of their face and body movements
*06:17.740- 06:25.400* :  and at the same time we recorded the brain electrical activity and the body saturation which
*06:25.400- 06:33.360* :  means the amount of oxygen inside the body and the amount of oxygen at brain level and we wanted
*06:33.360- 06:40.360* :  to see if things that we were seeing at an acoustical level were matching differences in all these
*06:40.360- 06:45.900* :  other variables we were analyzing. So you spent a great deal of time listening to babies crying.
*06:45.900- 06:53.560* :  How did you not go mad? Yes, correct. This is a good question. So the babies were not crying
*06:53.560- 07:00.020* :  for a long period of time. So actually we were setting up all the machines and then waiting for
*07:00.020- 07:04.900* :  the babies to cry spontaneously. Obviously we didn't do anything to elicit the crying. Good,
*07:04.900- 07:13.260* :  I'm glad we clarified that. But then after 15, 20 seconds we were telling parents to do whatever
*07:13.260- 07:19.700* :  they would do usually to just make baby comfortable so they weren't really crying for a long period of
*07:19.700- 07:27.760* :  time. Okay, what did you find? So what we found is that actually there is a link and we can match what
*07:27.800- 07:33.800* :  we see at an acoustical level with what we see in all the other variables that we analyze
*07:34.480- 07:39.980* :  and actually there are significant differences depending on different cry types.
*07:40.920- 07:46.580* :  We found a different characteristic in a baby crying because he's hungry, because he's in
*07:46.580- 07:54.740* :  this dress, because he's needing to burp, because he's lippy or fuzzy. So obviously you are working
*07:54.740- 08:00.780* :  on Spanish babies but they're preferable. So you'll find these useful for new parents everywhere
*08:00.780- 08:05.820* :  around the world. What can you tell them that are simple things to look out for when their
*08:05.820- 08:11.000* :  baby is crying and they don't know what's wrong? It's an interesting question. We have always to
*08:11.000- 08:16.260* :  stay calm and try different strategies at the beginning, as at the beginning we don't know what's
*08:16.260- 08:22.440* :  happening. But then keep in mind that for example the cry for hungry is a pride, there is more
*08:22.440- 08:29.340* :  construct, it's rhythmic usually is of short duration and it doesn't tend to be very high pitched
*08:30.120- 08:37.300* :  while they cry for a sleepiness which are the two cry types that more often happen. The cry for
*08:37.300- 08:43.700* :  sleepiness is a cry days more prolonged, there's monotonous and the heat has a falling melody,
*08:44.380- 08:50.500* :  let's say they have differences but that's why the company we have collaborated with to do this
*08:50.520- 08:55.320* :  study which is called Sound Dream, which is a company that is leader in cry interpretation
*08:55.460- 09:02.840* :  as develop a software through machine learning algorithms automatically interprets infant cry types.
*09:04.060- 09:10.500* :  It's not the same as mum though is it? It will never be the same. So the idea is that technology
*09:11.000- 09:15.980* :  might help first time parents but we have always to keep in mind that no technology can replace
*09:15.980- 09:21.780* :  parents that and parents will always be the ones that know their babies best. We have a clip of a
*09:21.780- 09:30.020* :  baby crying and we were wondering if you could interpret it for us. It's difficult to say I think.
*09:32.620- 09:38.900* :  It sounds to mean more like a hungry but I could be wrong. I find it still difficult to interpret
*09:38.900- 09:44.300* :  it with our context then. Yes we probably weren't being fair there. That was Dr Anna Lucia,
*09:44.300- 09:50.480* :  Paltryn Yeri in Barcelona. Now to be honest we hummed and hawed about whether this story
*09:50.480- 09:56.420* :  belonged in the happy pod because it's bitter sweet but it's also beautiful and inspiring.
*09:57.320- 10:01.620* :  It's about people working to save lowland gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo
*10:01.620- 10:09.320* :  from the effects of war, deforestation and poaching. The idea is to boost tourism. Once the gorillas
*10:09.320- 10:15.340* :  feel safer around humans, supervised groups will be able to observe them in their natural habitat
*10:16.200- 10:22.400* :  but it's all down to acceptance by the dominant male silverback. Viane Jenga is a wildlife
*10:22.400- 10:30.120* :  filmmaker whose family comes from the DRC. He's documented his efforts to win over a 250 kilo silver
*10:30.120- 10:40.540* :  back named Ampungui. The goal is to arbitrate a family of gorillas. A process designed to gradually
*10:40.540- 10:55.440* :  get and use to humans. This is our goal. But will the gorillas highly protective alpha male be willing
*10:55.440- 11:01.020* :  to accept us? In the end it's all down to him.
*11:06.280- 11:14.800* :  I have two minds fighting each other. One is to see the gorillas being habituated
*11:16.420- 11:22.000* :  so they get used to humans. But one is to
*11:22.000- 11:33.560* :  Alpungui remain wild. So what we're going to be doing is following habituation. Essentially a
*11:33.560- 11:42.720* :  process of getting a group of wild gorillas used to a human presence. So tourists can safely
*11:42.720- 11:54.000* :  enter their territory. But we've primates is never easy. It's work that takes between two
*11:54.000- 12:05.280* :  and ten years. It's very hard work. To habituate a gorilla family, essentially you are trying to
*12:05.280- 12:17.700* :  show them that you are a friend and you do this by acting like them. To help them to know that
*12:17.700- 12:27.720* :  we're here there are signs that we use. You do that and the baby goes, my friend has arrived to watch
*12:36.880- 12:43.960* :  us. For them to see us acting the same, it's to reassure them to make them feel comfortable.
*12:49.260- 12:54.620* :  He's gorillas are wild. They don't know how they come across us. They're especially
*12:54.620- 12:57.560* :  the super back. He's very serious. He's got a job to do.
*13:06.280- 13:11.200* :  The previous terrain he was able to gauge the distance between his family and us.
*13:12.180- 13:13.780* :  They would be more relaxed.
*13:20.880- 13:26.980* :  This is very dangerous. Oh my god!
*13:28.840- 13:36.560* :  It's absolutely remarkable that he decided no to hurt me because it could if he wanted to.
*13:39.180- 13:45.260* :  And I can see it's a tough job for this equal guard who devoted their lives to gorillas.
*13:46.560- 13:52.700* :  It's really tough. I don't do this job for just a pleasure.
*13:55.360- 14:03.860* :  I do it now because I want to get people engaged into what needs to be done to make sure
*14:03.860- 14:06.480* :  that the gorillas are protected.
*14:10.980- 14:16.560* :  I mean a sudden through the habituation we became part of the group.
*14:17.880- 14:26.200* :  And they start doing things naturally. And the rest of the moment when you start getting the best
*14:26.980- 14:28.860* :  out of their behaviour.
*14:33.200- 14:38.240* :  Look, we are surrounded by their own raised family.
*14:41.160- 14:44.200* :  This whole place is peppered with gorillas.
*14:47.000- 14:53.600* :  We are fully accepted. This is one of the sun. It must be around six.
*14:54.680- 14:55.480* :  And they want to play.
*14:59.940- 15:00.360* :  Your turn.
*15:12.660- 15:17.640* :  The filmmaker, V&A, Jane Gay and his documentary is called Silverback.
*15:17.640- 15:23.400* :  We also heard from Papalombaer Mongane, the chief guide in Akahousi, Biagar National Park.
*15:24.360- 15:29.520* :  To Mozambique now, a country working hard to recover from cyclone I die five years ago.
*15:30.080- 15:33.380* :  Our correspondent, Nomsa Maseko, has been back to the city of Beira.
*15:33.720- 15:36.040* :  You might have heard one of her reports earlier in the week.
*15:36.040- 15:39.820* :  And she's been talking to people trying to help their communities adapt.
*15:40.620- 15:46.520* :  Jose Joaquim has learnt new skills to build a cyclone resistant house for his family.
*15:50.040- 15:51.720* :  We're still under construction.
*15:52.360- 15:58.900* :  We only cook in here. We're still living in the old house next door, because we're still working here.
*16:01.820- 16:07.040* :  So when the next door comes, you think that you are in a better position to make sure that your
*16:07.160- 16:08.120* :  family is protected.
*16:11.200- 16:17.700* :  Yeah, in a good position. Me and my family will be safe. Because of the resilient techniques I
*16:17.700- 16:19.500* :  used here, we'll be safe.
*16:21.020- 16:26.440* :  Jose Joaquim, and you can listen to Nomsa Maseko's documentary by downloading the documentary podcast.
*16:31.820- 16:33.240* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*16:33.820- 16:40.200* :  With the sperm whales, it looks like there isn't a big mama who's telling everyone else what to do.
*16:41.400- 16:43.740* :  A kind of democracy amongst sperm whales.

*17:23.100- 17:27.720* :  I'm Katya Adler, and today on the global story I'll be looking at what the surprise and
*17:27.720- 17:33.800* :  imminent abdication of Denmark's Queen Magrata and the country's new king mean for all of Europe's
*17:33.800- 17:39.000* :  royal families. The global story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC

*17:52.640- 17:57.720* :  Now to a story of sporting triumph that proves that age really is just a number.
*17:58.320- 18:02.920* :  Marjorie Curtin has won a club medal in a qualifier for the England golf competition
*18:03.060- 18:09.320* :  at the age of 93, with a net score of two under par, and I'm assured that golf is among you will
*18:09.320- 18:14.760* :  know what that means. She beat players many years younger than her. The BBC's Molly Brewer has been
*18:14.760- 18:18.940* :  to meet Marjorie at the carous green golf club in Cumbria in the north of England.
*18:26.980- 18:33.400* :  So Marjorie, I believe a congratulations in order firstly. You have won one of your club medals
*18:33.400- 18:41.540* :  at the age of 93, which is amazing, congratulations. I don't feel any different than I did when I was
*18:41.800- 18:47.960* :  twenty and I'm just the same. And how was it to win that medal? Because you certainly don't look
*18:47.960- 18:54.320* :  93. Well, I didn't realise I'd won it really. I got that was so surprised. And it was just one of
*18:54.320- 19:00.620* :  those games. Everything went perfect. I couldn't, I've had a close my eyes, it would have gone in the
*19:00.620- 19:06.300* :  hole. And I had just had a good round. Never thought anything about being a medal or anything like that.
*19:06.300- 19:15.100* :  I mean, and it wasn't until we had the presentation evening and I was sitting there and I heard
*19:15.100- 19:20.240* :  the name Mrs. Curtin. I thought, that's not me because I haven't won anything. Thinking it was my
*19:20.240- 19:26.500* :  daughter-in-law because she's Mrs. Curtin. And I kept saying Mrs. Curtin, Mrs. Curtin. I said,
*19:26.500- 19:33.600* :  I haven't won anything. Yes, she did. She won the medal. So that was how it all came about, quite out of the blue.
*19:34.940- 19:41.460* :  I heard it in down the middle. It went in down the middle.
*19:42.820- 19:48.580* :  You've been beating people that are much younger than you actually. So you are a dark horse.
*19:48.800- 19:55.820* :  I just have more practice than they ever. I know you love the sport, you love golf. Tell us what it is
*19:55.820- 20:02.800* :  that you love about it so much. I like the company. I like the friendship. I like the challenge.
*20:03.780- 20:07.140* :  And it just keeps me fit and keeps me going. It keeps me out of mischief.
*20:07.780- 20:12.520* :  I know you like playing with your grandchildren as well. Tell us a little bit about that.
*20:12.860- 20:17.140* :  It's for the family. It's for fun. It's for friendliness. I love watching them.
*20:17.320- 20:23.500* :  Yeah. So what more could you wish for? We've just entered 2024. Have you got any more medals
*20:23.500- 20:26.800* :  in your sights? Do you think this year? Are you going to be winning anymore?
*20:27.020- 20:27.600* :  We never know.
*20:37.900- 20:42.820* :  Molly Brewer with Marjorie Curtin in the north of England and with a little bit of help from
*20:42.820- 20:47.900* :  Bing Crosby. Now a couple of other things we like to look of this week in Warsaw in Poland
*20:48.000- 20:53.240* :  where temperatures were forecast to drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius and animal shelter
*20:53.240- 20:58.420* :  launched Operation Frost, sending out an urgent appeal for people to adopt or at least
*20:58.420- 21:04.180* :  temporarily shelter some of its dogs until the cold spell passes. And the response was
*21:04.180- 21:10.320* :  overwhelming. People arrived in droves, stood in queues in the cold for hours and reportedly
*21:10.320- 21:17.920* :  took home 120 dogs, meaning all of them got somewhere warm to stay. And some promising reports
*21:17.920- 21:23.620* :  on cancer care as well in the biggest study of its kind. It was found that combining DNA
*21:23.620- 21:29.860* :  evidence with clinical data can actually help tailor care and improve which drugs are given to
*21:29.860- 21:37.420* :  which patients. And news of the discovery last year of 74 previously unknown plants and 15 fungi
*21:37.840- 21:43.140* :  including an underground forest and spectacular orchids. Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens
*21:43.660- 21:50.180* :  say many of the mysterious species were found in unlikely places such as on the top of a volcano
*21:50.180- 21:57.300* :  or clinging to Antarctic rocks plenty more on that on the BBC News website on our science pages.
*21:58.760- 22:04.640* :  Now we found out this week how much whales and humans have in common. Researchers in Canada
*22:04.640- 22:11.040* :  discovered that sperm whales, one of the most common, operate a kind of democracy and live in
*22:11.040- 22:17.320* :  clans with distinctive cultures much like humans do. How whitehead of Dalhousie University
*22:17.320- 22:23.660* :  told us more about the study? It's pretty fascinating. The clans are really important to the
*22:23.660- 22:30.060* :  sperm whales lives. Even though there may be two or more clans in an area, they don't associate
*22:30.060- 22:36.060* :  with one another and they have characteristic clan specific behaviors. So this clan does this
*22:36.200- 22:42.500* :  and that clan does that. And then we figured out that this is all cultural. They're learning it all
*22:42.500- 22:49.460* :  from each other how to speed their dialect as well as the particular behaviors of the clans.
*22:50.140- 22:57.340* :  Also, even though they will mostly not meet most other members of their clan, they would know if
*22:57.340- 23:02.140* :  they did meet them that they were from their clan or they were from a different clan. This is a
*23:02.140- 23:08.880* :  big structure of their lives and it's a huge structure. So there may be 20,000 female sperm whales
*23:08.880- 23:14.720* :  in a clan. You did actually specifically say female sperm whales. Why is that? Well because the
*23:14.720- 23:22.820* :  males lead a kind of very different life. They come down to the tropics from time to time and
*23:22.820- 23:31.140* :  mate with the females that provide sperm but not much else. Anyway, that's the pattern we were
*23:31.140- 23:40.160* :  getting with a few really interesting twists. You also discovered a form of democracy in these
*23:40.180- 23:49.380* :  clans? Indeed. One of the more contentious aspects of recent writing about human prehistory is
*23:49.380- 23:56.500* :  that the old picture was that we were pretty democratic as hunter gatherer groups but then as we
*23:56.500- 24:03.440* :  got agriculture and bureaucracy and all that, we became much more top down. With the sperm whales,
*24:04.220- 24:10.220* :  it looks like there isn't a big mama who's telling everyone else what to do. Instead, a lot of
*24:10.220- 24:15.120* :  the time they're making important decisions for them. So you might have 40 sperm whales together
*24:15.800- 24:21.120* :  swimming across the ocean and the ocean is broad. They've got to decide where to go and it's
*24:21.120- 24:25.840* :  important to them because there's good food in some places, not so good in other places and
*24:26.080- 24:31.720* :  there may be dangers as well in different areas. So they've got to make these decisions and when
*24:31.720- 24:39.500* :  we watch them make the decisions, they tend to do it slowly and messily. So a group of 40 sperm
*24:39.500- 24:48.180* :  whales taking a couple of hours to turn 90 degrees and that looks much more like a democratic
*24:48.180- 24:55.860* :  business and it's slow, it's messy but in common with other democracy and other formats,
*24:55.860- 25:03.420* :  it is more likely to produce the right answer than someone telling us this is what you should do.
*25:04.140- 25:14.080* :  Now you have been studying whales since 1985, I gather. What is it about whales that drew you in
*25:14.740- 25:21.140* :  and made you devote your professional life to their study? Well, I've been fascinated by the ocean
*25:21.520- 25:26.720* :  and as I talked to you, I'm actually looking at my window at the ocean which is, you know, it's
*25:26.720- 25:33.800* :  riveting. In the depotion is this extraordinary creature which has the largest brain on earth,
*25:33.860- 25:39.840* :  it has the largest nose on earth, it makes the most powerful sound of any animal, it is incredibly
*25:39.840- 25:47.540* :  social, it has these huge large-scale social structures, it just captivated me and I love
*25:47.540- 25:54.680* :  picking out there with it, yeah. Hal Whitehurt of Dalhousie University in Canada and from one of the
*25:54.680- 25:59.840* :  biggest creatures to a very small one, you might have seen a lovely bit of video doing the social
*25:59.840- 26:05.560* :  media rounds of a mouse apparently tidying up a work surface in a shed if you haven't, I will
*26:05.560- 26:11.480* :  be sharing it again. The shed belongs to Rodney Hallbrook from Whales and my colleague Sarah Montague
*26:11.480- 26:17.360* :  asked him how he first discovered he had a little helper. Well, the first sign was in the box I got,
*26:17.360- 26:22.760* :  where I got some peanuts in for feeding the birds outside in the garden, I went in one morning
*26:22.760- 26:27.940* :  in early October and the nuts it was in there was gone and I thought well I haven't seen the nuts,
*26:29.100- 26:34.560* :  so the next morning I put more in and they was gone again, so I thought there's some ice cream
*26:34.560- 26:41.680* :  going on here, so I put the nuts back in and the next morning I had bits and pieces put on top
*26:41.680- 26:46.940* :  the nuts, I thought I got to set a light camera up here, so I set it up on a tripod and we shed
*26:46.940- 26:53.500* :  and low and build, there's the videos I got. What seems phenomenal about it is, well, how many
*26:53.500- 26:58.540* :  pieces this mouse is picking up and putting in, well it's what it looks like, it looks almost like
*26:58.540- 27:03.600* :  a dish, did you deliberately put more things out for it to tidy up? I added a couple of things,
*27:03.600- 27:09.700* :  but not much really, because I want it to be as natural as possible. But it goes to quite a lot
*27:09.700- 27:16.020* :  of effort to pick things up and it does look like it's tidying. It does, that's why I called it
*27:16.020- 27:22.120* :  tidying up, but you're going to ask me why I reckon it does it. Of course I am, why do you reckon?
*27:22.960- 27:29.320* :  I think it's just covering the nuts up to hide them away from any other mouse that might venture
*27:29.900- 27:36.100* :  past. This is mine nuts, you're not having them, so it's hiding them. The other thing I could think
*27:36.100- 27:40.880* :  is doing is just enjoying yourself, I'm a bit of fun every night, but I can't imagine that.
*27:41.440- 27:46.300* :  It takes it every day, tonight, I'm sure in the morning, a little bit put back in again,
*27:46.860- 27:53.220* :  well when I say all of it, it varies sometimes between lots of it being put in and sort of half of
*27:53.220- 27:58.680* :  it being put in, and there was one occasion where there was none put in, I thought he's gone.
*28:00.020- 28:06.760* :  But the next day was back again. You say he. Oh, I don't know. I ain't sure, I really ain't sure,
*28:06.760- 28:11.380* :  I says he. We've got to be clear what size. I mean, this is, we're talking very small mouse.
*28:11.380- 28:17.220* :  How big are the things it's picking up? There was one, it picked up a long, I must have had a
*28:17.220- 28:22.800* :  stick of some sort on there, out there, like you see it on the video, I think, there's a long stick
*28:22.800- 28:28.440* :  which is about six times the length of it. I just wondered, given you've got this mouse to do
*28:28.440- 28:31.660* :  the clearing up after you, has it stopped you tidying up? Yeah.
*28:35.740- 28:36.840* :  That was Rodney Holbrook.
