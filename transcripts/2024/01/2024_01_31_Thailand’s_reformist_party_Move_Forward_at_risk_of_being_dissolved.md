*00:17.720- 00:21.580* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring
*00:21.580- 00:22.760* :  our prices down.
*00:23.200- 00:27.000* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer, which is apparently a thing.

*00:54.220- 00:59.540* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and at $1,400 GMT on Wednesday, the 31st of January, these are our
*00:59.540- 01:00.360* :  main stories.
*01:00.840- 01:05.340* :  In Thailand, the opposition pro-democracy party moved forward, could be forced to dissolve
*01:05.340- 01:06.900* :  following a court ruling.
*01:06.900- 01:13.220* :  The way the court has ruled, in effect, snuffs out any chance of debate about the law.
*01:13.840- 01:19.000* :  More than a dozen UN aid organizations urged donor countries to restore funding for the
*01:19.000- 01:21.260* :  relief agency for Palestinians in Gaza.
*01:21.740- 01:25.960* :  The former Prime Minister of Pakistan in Rancan has been given another jail term.
*01:26.020- 01:29.280* :  This time, he's been sentenced to 14 years in prison.
*01:31.940- 01:37.340* :  Also, in this podcast, in France, if we need to go to Brussels to moral and create a
*01:37.340- 01:39.120* :  European movement, we'll do it.
*01:39.640- 01:41.840* :  The farmer's protest continues.
*01:46.000- 01:51.180* :  In Thailand, a constitutional court ruling could have profound implications for the country's
*01:51.280- 01:51.640* :  politics.
*01:51.660- 01:56.600* :  Nine judges have decided that a plan by the country's most popular party to amend a
*01:56.600- 02:01.480* :  law imposing severe punishments for speaking out against the role of family is tantamount
*02:01.480- 02:04.060* :  to overthrowing the democratic regime of government.
*02:04.680- 02:09.640* :  Last year's election was won by the opposition move forward party on a progressive platform,
*02:09.640- 02:14.440* :  which included a proposal to change the country's strict, lazy-magisty law.
*02:15.060- 02:18.060* :  As Sathist, Asia correspondent Jonathan Head told me more.
*02:18.540- 02:20.380* :  I think there's two important implications.
*02:21.400- 02:23.520* :  One is obviously for the party move forward.
*02:24.100- 02:29.660* :  Having been found to have violated the constitution, in fact, the move forward leader, Peter Limgerunrat,
*02:29.660- 02:33.200* :  described it as being accused of treason in his response to it.
*02:33.480- 02:37.800* :  The party is now very vulnerable to a move from a conservative or anyone in the authorities
*02:37.800- 02:38.780* :  to have it dissolved.
*02:39.200- 02:43.580* :  The courts and talent have huge powers to dissolve parties to Sath governments, and it's
*02:43.580- 02:47.260* :  happened before it happened to the previous incarnation of move forward, so there's a lot
*02:47.260- 02:52.340* :  of concern that that might happen despite its immense electoral success last year.
*02:52.720- 02:56.880* :  The other implication is over what can or cannot be said about the monarchy.
*02:57.820- 03:02.020* :  The monarchy is very strictly protected in Thailand, and everyone knows it's a sensitive
*03:02.020- 03:07.120* :  subject, and the Les-magisty law has always prevented any really negative comment about
*03:07.120- 03:07.380* :  it.
*03:07.800- 03:11.240* :  But the court appears to be saying you can't even talk about the law itself.
*03:11.340- 03:17.000* :  Move forward felt it was a legitimate subject to talk about in its election campaign, because
*03:17.000- 03:21.480* :  it's a law it's passed by Parliament, it's widely viewed as too harsh, and the party
*03:21.480- 03:24.540* :  argued that when in Parliament we will propose amending it.
*03:24.700- 03:27.680* :  The court has said you can't do that, at least not the way you've been doing it.
*03:27.680- 03:30.900* :  You cannot have a discussion, you can't have public debate about it.
*03:31.360- 03:36.300* :  It really means that not just the monarchy, but the law that protects the monarchy have
*03:36.300- 03:42.640* :  become untouchable, and the move forward party has in its response raised this as a serious
*03:42.640- 03:47.920* :  concern saying, well, actually make the monarchy more of a topic of controversial discussions.
*03:48.440- 03:52.060* :  It might create clashes between the courts and the Parliament.
*03:52.140- 03:54.820* :  They see all sorts of problems coming out of this ruling.
*03:55.760- 03:59.840* :  And you talk about problems coming out of this ruling, has anyone come out onto the streets
*03:59.840- 04:04.060* :  to protest, because we have seen student protests in Thailand before?
*04:04.820- 04:05.340* :  Yes, of course.
*04:05.400- 04:09.580* :  I mean, there's a lot of history here, because when move forwards, previous incarnation,
*04:09.580- 04:14.380* :  the future forward was also dissolved by the courts, also after having done very well
*04:14.380- 04:19.000* :  in an election four years ago, that was what sparked off the biggest protest we've seen
*04:19.020- 04:24.620* :  on which involved this issue, young youth, youth-led protests, where the discussion about
*04:24.620- 04:27.560* :  the monarchy was unprecedentedly open and bold.
*04:28.080- 04:33.580* :  Now I don't think we'll see the same thing this time, the time is different, the public
*04:33.580- 04:38.280* :  mood is different, but also the leaders of those protests four years ago are themselves
*04:38.280- 04:43.560* :  now on trial for there's majesty, some of them facing multiple criminal charges, many
*04:43.560- 04:47.060* :  of them in jail, in effect the leadership of that movement has been crushed.
*04:47.620- 04:51.720* :  And I think people will think twice before going out onto the streets over this issue,
*04:52.140- 04:57.180* :  as they did in the past, given the risks that the law can be used so effectively against
*04:57.240- 04:57.480* :  them.
*04:57.940- 05:04.920* :  But it will lead to the lingering public dissatisfaction with Thailand's political system, where the
*05:04.920- 05:08.840* :  choice of the electorate, remember, more people, far more people voted for move forward
*05:09.200- 05:13.420* :  than any other party in last year's election, with that policy platform was saying we want
*05:13.420- 05:16.960* :  to change the royal defamation law, and now the courts are saying, well, whatever you
*05:16.960- 05:21.180* :  vote for, we're not going to allow it, and I think that's going to lead to quite a lot
*05:21.180- 05:26.160* :  of disillusionment, and of course, what it could do is lead to even greater popularity
*05:26.160- 05:30.840* :  for move forward, or whatever party succeeds in if the party isn't had dissolved.
*05:33.000- 05:38.420* :  We cannot abandon the people, that's the plea from United Nations aid agencies, who
*05:38.420- 05:43.000* :  want donations resumed to fund the main humanitarian organization in Gaza.
*05:43.680- 05:48.700* :  Contraries including the US, UK and Germany have paused their funding of the UN's Palestinian
*05:48.700- 05:53.800* :  refugee agency Anwar, after allegations that some of its staff were involved in the
*05:53.800- 05:56.040* :  Hamas attacks in Israel last October.
*05:56.740- 06:02.200* :  In a statement, the heads of all UN aid agencies insisted any employees involved will be held
*06:02.200- 06:07.840* :  accountable, but said stopping financial support to Anwar will have catastrophic consequences
*06:07.840- 06:11.000* :  for the more than two million people dependent on aid.
*06:11.020- 06:14.040* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem, Nick Beak, has more.
*06:14.440- 06:20.180* :  We've had a joint statement from the various bosses of the United Nations agencies, and
*06:20.180- 06:25.320* :  they've described the allegations against some members of staff as being horrifying.
*06:25.320- 06:30.980* :  The allegation that's come from Israel, that some members of the United Nations agency
*06:30.980- 06:37.180* :  for Palestinian refugees were actually involved in the Hamas attacks of October 7th, but
*06:37.180- 06:41.820* :  at the same time, the senior United Nations officials are saying that the whole organization
*06:42.460- 06:46.420* :  shouldn't be punished for that, and that is because they say that they're the only
*06:47.220- 06:51.880* :  organization that is in a position to help the two million Palestinians in Gaza, who
*06:51.880- 06:56.760* :  they say desperately need assistance, whether that's health care, food, getting supplies
*06:56.760- 06:58.940* :  of fuel to them.
*06:59.660- 07:04.300* :  Of course, Israel says that the evidence is put forward suggests that Anwar shouldn't
*07:04.300- 07:08.300* :  have any role in the future in Gaza that it's simply not fit for purpose.
*07:08.600- 07:10.100* :  It's pretty complicated this.
*07:10.100- 07:14.260* :  If you look at what's happening with the United States, America is saying that Anwar is
*07:14.260- 07:19.020* :  the only organization that is able to look after people, but of course it is the biggest
*07:19.020- 07:20.360* :  donor of the United States.
*07:20.780- 07:25.760* :  It has for now suspended its funding, so a very difficult situation, top UN officials
*07:25.760- 07:31.300* :  warning of catastrophe if the funding isn't extended, and they're saying that they'll
*07:31.300- 07:35.780* :  have to cease their operations after the end of February if no more cash comes through.
*07:36.380- 07:37.880* :  Nick Beak in Jerusalem.
*07:38.640- 07:43.440* :  Meanwhile, there's little sign of an end to the war with Israel reporting clashes in northern
*07:43.440- 07:46.620* :  Gaza and ongoing fighting in the rest of the strip.
*07:47.200- 07:52.140* :  The violence has been tearing families apart and creating thousands of orphans, according
*07:52.140- 07:58.240* :  to a recent report from Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, more than 24,000 children have lost
*07:58.400- 07:59.600* :  one or both parents.
*08:00.180- 08:05.520* :  In the chaos caused by the conflict, medics and rescuers often struggle to find carers
*08:05.580- 08:06.540* :  for bereaved children.
*08:07.300- 08:12.800* :  At least corresponding Yolandael has been finding out more and parts of her report are distressing.
*08:14.660- 08:19.900* :  Her vital signs are good, but born amid the horrors of Gaza's war, the wide-eyed,
*08:19.900- 08:24.320* :  month-old baby in an incubator has never known a parent's hug.
*08:24.900- 08:30.220* :  She was delivered by C-section after her mother Hannah was crushed in an Israeli air strike.
*08:32.380- 08:34.660* :  She was called Hannah Abouamsha's daughter.
*08:37.020- 08:39.500* :  Hannah died before she could name her child.
*08:40.140- 08:44.320* :  The nurse, Wardah Al-Audah, explains, at a dearabala hospital.
*08:46.960- 08:52.240* :  We've lost connection with her relatives, nobody came, her mother was killed and we don't
*08:52.260- 08:53.680* :  know what happened to her father.
*08:56.420- 09:01.740* :  Over three months of relentless Israeli bombardment haven't spared the youngest garsens.
*09:02.260- 09:08.000* :  Israel says it tries to avoid hurting civilians, but more than 11,000 children have reportedly
*09:08.000- 09:08.940* :  been killed.
*09:09.460- 09:11.920* :  Many more have seen their families wrenched away.
*09:13.540- 09:19.220* :  Ibrahim Aboumus, just 10, is being treated for leg and stomach injuries caused when a
*09:19.220- 09:24.660* :  missile hit his home, but his tears of his dead mum, grandpa and sister.
*09:30.280- 09:34.680* :  They kept telling me that they were being treated upstairs in the hospital, he says, but
*09:34.680- 09:37.840* :  I found out the truth when I saw photos on my dad's phone.
*09:38.620- 09:41.280* :  I cried so much that I hurt all over.
*09:47.520- 09:52.660* :  By the sandy graves of their relatives in a school turned shelter, the cousins of the
*09:52.660- 09:55.740* :  Hussein family sit together in trauma and grief.
*09:56.520- 09:58.840* :  Each has lost one or both parents.
*10:04.220- 10:06.520* :  The bomb fell on my mum's lap, Abid says.
*10:07.100- 10:10.720* :  It took us days to take all her body parts from the rubble of the house.
*10:12.100- 10:13.400* :  Every day is hard.
*10:14.660- 10:16.780* :  It's not nice.
*10:16.960- 10:20.740* :  There's no water, food or drink, says Kinza Hussein.
*10:21.880- 10:22.720* :  Everything's sad.
*10:25.640- 10:31.440* :  All garsens now strive to find safety and rely on aid handouts for the basics of life,
*10:32.260- 10:38.800* :  the UN's children's agency says its biggest concern is for an estimated 19,000 children
*10:39.200- 10:43.080* :  who are orphaned or have ended up alone with no adults to look after them.
*10:43.700- 10:49.400* :  Some are sole survivors of bombings, others have been found at Israeli checkpoints in hospitals
*10:49.400- 10:50.600* :  or on the streets.
*10:51.300- 10:55.880* :  Jonathan Crick, the communications chief for UNICEF Palestine, is in Raffa.
*10:56.760- 11:00.780* :  For the youngest one, they very often cannot even say their name.
*11:01.340- 11:05.240* :  And even the older one, they are usually in shock.
*11:06.020- 11:11.300* :  When the extended family can be found, they also have their own children.
*11:11.660- 11:19.280* :  So sometimes it's difficult, if not impossible, for them to take care of those unaccompanied
*11:19.280- 11:20.340* :  and separated children.
*11:21.780- 11:27.180* :  With their lives shattered, UNICEF says nearly all of Gaza's children need mental health
*11:27.180- 11:27.660* :  support.
*11:28.800- 11:34.320* :  And even when the war's over, many will be left with terrible losses that they'll struggle
*11:34.320- 11:35.140* :  to overcome.
*11:37.620- 11:40.420* :  You'll anneal on the bereaved children of Gaza.
*11:41.340- 11:45.980* :  The former Prime Minister of Pakistan in Rancan has been given another long prison sentence,
*11:46.000- 11:48.420* :  this time alongside his wife Bushra.
*11:48.820- 11:55.380* :  The pair have been convicted of buying state kits worth more than $500,000 at an undervalued
*11:55.380- 11:57.020* :  price while he was in office.
*11:57.640- 12:02.740* :  Now the courts have sentenced Rancan to a further 14-years-long jail after he was given
*12:02.740- 12:06.220* :  a 10-year jail sentence for leaking state secrets on Tuesday.
*12:06.700- 12:08.920* :  These sentences will run at the same time.
*12:09.440- 12:14.360* :  I spoke to our correspondent Caroline Davis in Islamabad and asked her what this latest
*12:14.360- 12:15.160* :  sentence involves.
*12:15.940- 12:19.900* :  So this particular case today was referred to as the Tosha Kana case.
*12:19.940- 12:26.240* :  Now this is the accusation that Imran Khan and his wife Bushra BB purchased items including
*12:26.240- 12:28.680* :  a jail reset, a watch, a pen.
*12:29.140- 12:31.660* :  These were state gifts that had been given to Pakistan.
*12:32.240- 12:35.600* :  Politicians here are able to purchase those items.
*12:36.180- 12:41.300* :  But the accusation is that Imran Khan and Bushra BB purchased them at an undervalued price
*12:41.880- 12:48.280* :  therefore kept those items after that time, even after he had left office as well.
*12:48.280- 12:53.780* :  And now as a result of this conviction that was brought by the anti-corruption unit here
*12:53.780- 12:58.300* :  in Pakistan, they have been sentenced to 14 years in prison each.
*12:58.300- 13:04.920* :  They've also been told they have to pay a fine of over 1.5 billion rupees between them.
*13:04.920- 13:09.660* :  And they have both been barred from holding public office for 10 years.
*13:10.400- 13:14.760* :  We should say shouldn't we that they both deny all the accusations and will they now appeal?
*13:14.980- 13:19.360* :  Their laws have been pretty adamant that they will appeal against these charges.
*13:19.560- 13:22.400* :  The laws themselves said that they weren't in fact inside court.
*13:22.400- 13:28.020* :  In fact, when the court hearing happened, only journalists and the judge were inside court.
*13:28.020- 13:32.860* :  Both Bushra BB and Imran Khan were not in court to hear their sentencing.
*13:32.860- 13:38.320* :  This was all done inside the Adiala jail on the outskirts of Raal Pindi,
*13:38.520- 13:40.400* :  not far away from where I am in Islamabad.
*13:40.440- 13:46.540* :  And that's because Imran Khan has been in jail behind bars since August of last year.
*13:46.740- 13:51.800* :  And so all of the court proceedings for this case have been heard while he's been inside those jail facilities.
*13:52.360- 13:56.080* :  The lawyers then turned up shortly afterwards and said that they were told by the media
*13:56.080- 13:58.220* :  of what happened inside that court case.
*13:58.220- 14:03.220* :  We've asked the Justice Ministry for further information about exactly what happened there.
*14:03.620- 14:08.940* :  But the lawyers made it very clear that they think that this is not a fair procedure of justice.
*14:08.940- 14:12.340* :  They have referred to the whole proceedings as being a kangaroo court
*14:12.340- 14:16.540* :  and have said that they are planning to appeal against this decision.
*14:17.120- 14:19.240* :  And of course, Caroline elections are coming up.
*14:19.240- 14:21.400* :  What in less than two weeks in Pakistan?
*14:21.400- 14:26.200* :  So what impact is all this having all this to do with Imran Khan?
*14:26.440- 14:28.720* :  What's the impact is it having on the voters?
*14:29.680- 14:34.620* :  So it is a week and one day until the general elections start here in Pakistan.
*14:34.620- 14:39.080* :  Imran Khan had already been disqualified from running in those elections.
*14:39.080- 14:42.020* :  So this doesn't change anything directly for him.
*14:42.500- 14:44.620* :  But the suggestion has been by political analysts.
*14:45.200- 14:47.860* :  Does this change the calculation for voters?
*14:47.860- 14:53.000* :  Now Imran Khan's party, the PTI, had their symbol of the cricket bat removed
*14:53.000- 14:55.680* :  from them by the Electoral Commission here in Pakistan.
*14:55.680- 15:01.200* :  They are running as independence, but are quite clearly backed by the party, by the PTI.
*15:01.680- 15:05.600* :  So now are we going to see a drop in morale from both those candidates
*15:05.600- 15:08.760* :  and from the supporters from the voters who feel well Imran Khan
*15:08.760- 15:11.060* :  is not coming out of prison anytime soon.
*15:11.340- 15:14.500* :  There's no point in voting for a party that he founded.
*15:14.700- 15:16.860* :  Or are we going to see the counter effect?
*15:16.900- 15:20.400* :  Are we going to suddenly see a boost in the number of voters turning out
*15:20.840- 15:22.940* :  for the PTI-backed candidates?
*15:22.940- 15:27.800* :  We don't know yet and that will all reveal itself on the 8th of February next week.
*15:28.480- 15:30.100* :  Caroline Davis in Pakistan.
*15:30.960- 15:35.320* :  In France, protests by angry farmers are continuing with motorways blocked
*15:35.320- 15:40.860* :  and slow-moving convoys of tractors causing traffic jams on key routes into Paris.
*15:41.120- 15:45.340* :  The farmers are demonstrating about a range of issues, including rising costs,
*15:45.340- 15:49.800* :  fuel prices, inflation, bureaucracy and Ukrainian grain imports.
*15:50.460- 15:53.960* :  The demonstrations in France follows similar action in other European countries,
*15:54.400- 15:55.740* :  including Germany and the Netherlands.
*15:56.360- 16:00.160* :  Ethnie Bell has been talking to a French dairy farmer who's taking part.
*16:00.800- 16:05.300* :  Alain O'Besse feeds his calves at his farm north of Paris.
*16:06.380- 16:09.480* :  Six generations of his family have farm this land,
*16:10.220- 16:14.480* :  but he's worried there may not be a future here, who is 15-year-old son.
*16:14.680- 16:15.760* :  Oh my God, you aren't here.
*16:15.980- 16:19.200* :  We have lost a third of our dairy farms in France in 20 years.
*16:19.820- 16:23.120* :  It's a reality, an inevitability, and it continues.
*16:23.660- 16:24.480* :  It's a tidal wave.
*16:24.920- 16:28.460* :  Today, I'm losing all my neighbors whether they have small or big farms.
*16:28.720- 16:32.160* :  Arno says there's too much regulation and too little money.
*16:32.960- 16:35.420* :  His anger has spurred him to join the protests.
*16:36.320- 16:41.120* :  His tractor is now one of hundreds blocking one of the major motorways to Paris.
*16:42.840- 16:48.480* :  The protests have blown up into a huge crisis for France's new prime minister, Gabriela Tal.
*16:49.380- 16:51.420* :  But in a speech to the National Assembly,
*16:51.420- 16:54.600* :  he said his government was ready to find answers.
*16:56.880- 16:57.980* :  I say it here solemnly.
*16:58.140- 17:01.280* :  There is and there must be an exception for French agriculture.
*17:01.800- 17:04.220* :  I see clearly that faced with all the red tape,
*17:04.660- 17:07.440* :  faced with decisions dictated from whoever knows where,
*17:07.440- 17:11.180* :  farmers are confused and are waiting for answers and solutions.
*17:11.460- 17:13.820* :  France's leader, President Emmanuel Macron,
*17:13.820- 17:16.440* :  is going to meet the head of the European Commission,
*17:16.440- 17:19.320* :  who was a Lafonde Alliance in Brussels on Thursday.
*17:20.300- 17:24.140* :  He's called for reform, but also defended the EU.
*17:24.900- 17:28.560* :  Without the common agricultural policy,
*17:28.560- 17:30.540* :  our farmers would have no income.
*17:31.200- 17:33.260* :  For many of them, they wouldn't be able to earn a living.
*17:33.580- 17:37.400* :  So I hear a lot of things, but we need to set the record straight.
*17:37.400- 17:40.320* :  We have a strong European policy that enables us
*17:40.700- 17:44.140* :  to provide very substantial support to our farmers' incomes.
*17:47.400- 17:48.840* :  But out on the motorway,
*17:49.160- 17:51.280* :  Arno says he's willing to take the fight
*17:51.280- 17:52.600* :  all the way to Brussels.
*17:53.220- 17:56.240* :  If we need to go to Brussels tomorrow
*17:56.240- 17:58.840* :  and create a European movement, we'll do it.
*18:00.380- 18:01.840* :  Farmer Arno Bussey
*18:02.280- 18:05.040* :  And now, a quick request from Oliver Conway.
*18:05.640- 18:06.440* :  Thanks, Val, yes.
*18:06.540- 18:10.380* :  We need your help to make a special edition of the global news podcast
*18:10.380- 18:13.440* :  to mark the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine
*18:13.440- 18:14.860* :  on the 24th of February.
*18:15.320- 18:18.800* :  We'll be joining forces with the experts at the BBC's Ukraine cast
*18:18.800- 18:21.920* :  to answer your questions about where the war goes from here.
*18:22.580- 18:25.480* :  So if you want to know whether people in Ukraine still want to fight
*18:25.480- 18:30.020* :  or if ordinary Russians are beginning to turn against the special military operation
*18:30.400- 18:32.780* :  or anything else, then please email us
*18:32.900- 18:34.860* :  and if possible, record a voice note
*18:34.860- 18:36.760* :  so we can play it out in the podcast.
*18:36.760- 18:41.320* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk
*18:41.320- 18:44.920* :  or you can tweet us on X at Global NewsPod.
*18:45.700- 18:46.160* :  Thanks, Oli.
*18:49.160- 18:49.820* :  Still to come.
*18:49.860- 18:53.440* :  Both sides have dug in a Goliath-Vertice Goliath battle
*18:53.640- 18:55.600* :  potentially with an eye on setting a precedent
*18:55.600- 18:57.380* :  as the industry does develop more.
*18:58.300- 19:02.000* :  An app that's launched the career of many recording artists
*19:02.200- 19:06.480* :  but now TikTok faces the wrath of a global music corporation.
*19:07.300- 19:09.420* :  And let's take a trip to the west side
*19:09.860- 19:12.440* :  to remember one of Broadway's shining stars.
*19:14.280- 19:16.500* :  I love to be in the middle.
*19:23.480- 19:27.360* :  We look at the life of Chita Rivera, who's died at the age of 91.

*20:13.180- 20:14.400* :  Ryan Reynolds here for Mint Mobile.
*20:14.680- 20:17.520* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation
*20:17.520- 20:19.740* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*20:20.180- 20:22.760* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer
*20:22.780- 20:24.000* :  which is apparently a thing.
*20:24.380- 20:26.300* :  Mint Mobile unlimited premiere wireless.
*20:26.300- 20:29.740* :  Have it to get 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,
*20:29.740- 20:32.400* :  have it to get 15, 15, 15, 15, just 15 bucks a month.
*20:32.400- 20:36.200* :  So give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*20:36.540- 20:38.360* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees.
*20:38.420- 20:39.720* :  Promoting renew customers for limited time.
*20:39.860- 20:41.040* :  Unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month.
*20:41.040- 20:42.540* :  So it's full turns at MintMobile.com.
*20:48.960- 20:51.860* :  Leaders of big tech companies like MetaX and TikTok
*20:51.860- 20:54.980* :  are being questioned by a US congressional committee.
*20:55.260- 20:58.600* :  They're accusations of exploitation and abusive children
*20:58.920- 21:00.060* :  who use their platforms.
*21:00.700- 21:03.660* :  There's huge concern that children are not being protected
*21:03.660- 21:05.640* :  from sexual predators in bullying
*21:06.120- 21:08.760* :  and are getting access online to pornography
*21:08.760- 21:11.100* :  and information about self-harm.
*21:11.640- 21:13.420* :  Our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman,
*21:13.420- 21:17.700* :  told us some tech bosses were even reluctant to attend the hearing.
*21:18.020- 21:20.280* :  Some of them have actually had to be in subpoenaed
*21:20.400- 21:21.880* :  because they didn't want to come.
*21:22.000- 21:26.180* :  So Linda Yaccarino from X, Jason Citron, who's from Discord
*21:26.660- 21:28.320* :  and Evan Spiegel, who's from Snapchat.
*21:28.320- 21:31.220* :  None of them volunteered to be there.
*21:31.520- 21:34.280* :  I think it's going to be a pretty robust
*21:34.800- 21:37.960* :  and long hearing when we see these sort of things
*21:37.960- 21:40.600* :  in the past, the senators really don't hold back.
*21:41.060- 21:43.500* :  There's a lot of anger, I think,
*21:43.540- 21:49.080* :  and upset about the impact of some of the services
*21:49.080- 21:52.160* :  on children's safety and mental health.
*21:52.660- 21:54.840* :  But I also think that actually the senators
*21:54.840- 21:57.380* :  and the lawmakers need to take some responsibility here
*21:57.380- 22:00.280* :  too, particularly in the US, where they've talked
*22:00.280- 22:02.900* :  about this for so long and there's been lots of legislation
*22:02.900- 22:05.360* :  that's been discussed, but not much of it
*22:05.360- 22:07.060* :  has actually got very far.
*22:07.300- 22:09.700* :  I suppose a lot of people listening to this will think
*22:09.700- 22:12.840* :  well, how much is this appearance responsibility
*22:13.560- 22:16.760* :  to make sure their child is safe online
*22:16.780- 22:20.080* :  and how much is it to do with the actual tech companies?
*22:20.920- 22:24.180* :  I think that really is the million dollar question, isn't it?
*22:24.180- 22:28.720* :  I mean, obviously, as a parent, you want to look after your children.
*22:28.720- 22:32.220* :  You want to be as proactive as you can in safeguarding them
*22:32.220- 22:35.260* :  on the other hand, we've got these incredible communities
*22:35.260- 22:36.160* :  that are sprung up.
*22:36.200- 22:39.780* :  We know about the benefits that many people get from being online
*22:39.880- 22:43.000* :  and it is the world in which our children are growing up in.
*22:43.000- 22:46.620* :  So it's how to get that balance between letting them explore
*22:46.620- 22:47.820* :  it and trying to keep them safe.
*22:47.880- 22:50.260* :  On the other hand, the tech companies have created
*22:50.260- 22:53.500* :  these platforms in the first place and actually
*22:54.400- 22:56.640* :  should the bulk of the responsibility be on them?
*22:56.660- 22:58.240* :  There is no clear answer.
*22:58.240- 23:01.020* :  I think what we'll hear in Senate today is the tech companies
*23:02.160- 23:04.120* :  trying to put forward everything they're doing
*23:04.680- 23:07.840* :  and Senator saying, well, it's not enough, is it?
*23:08.400- 23:10.700* :  And do you think anything is going to change from this?
*23:11.280- 23:13.100* :  Well, we know that there's some legislation
*23:13.100- 23:15.840* :  that is getting a bit closer to the finish line
*23:15.840- 23:17.860* :  and perhaps we will see that.
*23:17.980- 23:20.740* :  I know that there's a lot of cynicism that will hear
*23:20.740- 23:23.540* :  is a lot of talk and a lot of drama
*23:23.580- 23:25.120* :  and now it will be dramatic.
*23:25.160- 23:26.740* :  I'm sure there'll be lots of theatre.
*23:27.200- 23:28.940* :  And these are very powerful figures
*23:28.940- 23:31.280* :  that we don't see very often in public.
*23:31.420- 23:32.960* :  So everyone will be very interested
*23:32.960- 23:35.700* :  in what these tech bosses have to say.
*23:35.700- 23:38.520* :  But ultimately, is it going to bring about a change?
*23:38.920- 23:40.460* :  The US is in election year.
*23:40.460- 23:41.660* :  There are so many priorities.
*23:41.660- 23:43.720* :  This could potentially be a big vote winner,
*23:43.720- 23:44.200* :  couldn't it?
*23:44.640- 23:47.580* :  In terms of being able to bring something in
*23:47.580- 23:50.820* :  that feels constructive and future-proofed and helpful.
*23:50.820- 23:53.740* :  But as we've seen in the UK, it's very hard to do.
*23:54.560- 23:55.320* :  Zoe Kleinman.
*23:55.960- 23:58.800* :  And now is TikTok about to change forever.
*24:11.260- 24:13.400* :  Just some of the tens of millions of clips
*24:13.400- 24:15.820* :  on TikTok using Taylor Swift music
*24:15.820- 24:19.540* :  for dancers, acting skits, and even running along the beach.
*24:20.080- 24:23.140* :  But Taylor Swift is a universal music artist
*24:23.140- 24:27.260* :  and Universal is now saying TikTok needs to stop using music
*24:27.260- 24:30.180* :  from anyone on their books or pay up.
*24:30.600- 24:32.280* :  Stephanie Prentice told Divina Gupta,
*24:32.840- 24:33.380* :  what's going on?
*24:33.660- 24:36.540* :  This is a good old-fashioned fight over cash.
*24:36.600- 24:39.260* :  So universal music, they're going back and forth
*24:39.260- 24:41.640* :  with TikTok of a getting paid for their artists.
*24:42.140- 24:44.960* :  That includes Taylor Swift, Drake, Adele, Harry Styles,
*24:44.960- 24:47.900* :  all hugely popular with TikTok demographics.
*24:48.640- 24:51.920* :  And Universal has laid out its argument in an open letter.
*24:52.500- 24:54.700* :  It says there are three critical issues
*24:54.700- 24:57.240* :  causing the breakdown of this negotiation.
*24:57.840- 24:59.600* :  One is pretty obvious, so getting paid
*24:59.600- 25:02.080* :  for artists and songwriters, then protection
*25:02.080- 25:04.860* :  from what it calls the harmful effects of AI
*25:05.280- 25:06.760* :  and also online safety.
*25:07.440- 25:11.420* :  Where it gets more sticky seems to be the alleged tactics used.
*25:11.580- 25:15.340* :  So Universal claim that TikTok attempt to give them a worse deal
*25:15.580- 25:17.040* :  than the one they currently have.
*25:17.440- 25:20.020* :  They're met their request and negotiate with what the letter calls
*25:20.020- 25:22.500* :  in difference, then intimidation.
*25:22.580- 25:24.920* :  It says TikTok tried to bully them by saying
*25:24.920- 25:27.180* :  it would remove the music of developing artists.
*25:27.180- 25:30.200* :  So those smaller artists, the Universal wants to promote
*25:30.200- 25:32.840* :  and just keep those global big hitters.
*25:33.360- 25:35.060* :  TikTok refute all of this.
*25:35.300- 25:38.940* :  It says Universal is putting greed above the interests of their artists
*25:39.280- 25:40.820* :  by walking away from this platform
*25:40.820- 25:44.500* :  that could put them in front of billions of users globally every day.
*25:44.940- 25:47.000* :  And the clock is ticking because it seems
*25:47.000- 25:50.920* :  that this arrangement is going to come to an end very soon.
*25:51.540- 25:52.540* :  Yep, it expires today.
*25:52.540- 25:54.200* :  The clock is definitely ticking.
*25:54.680- 25:56.140* :  Let's take a quick listen to Mark Mulligan.
*25:56.180- 25:58.820* :  He works for media research and he's a music analyst.
*25:59.280- 26:02.040* :  There are billions of dollars of worth of royalties out there,
*26:02.040- 26:05.160* :  but not that much of it is currently on social media.
*26:05.160- 26:07.620* :  Most of those royalties are on streaming services,
*26:07.620- 26:08.960* :  like Spotify, etc.
*26:09.400- 26:11.980* :  We begin to see the rise of social media
*26:11.980- 26:14.040* :  as being something a completely different part
*26:14.040- 26:14.860* :  of the music business.
*26:15.540- 26:17.880* :  TikTok thinks it is more valuable to, you know,
*26:17.880- 26:20.480* :  Universal's getting more value out of it by promoting its artists
*26:20.880- 26:23.380* :  and Universal thinks TikTok's getting more value out of its artists.
*26:23.380- 26:26.180* :  So we are, this is really sort of a growing pain
*26:26.180- 26:27.360* :  of a new sector of the business.
*26:27.980- 26:29.080* :  So as we heard there right now,
*26:29.080- 26:32.620* :  both sides have dug in a Goliath versus Goliath battle,
*26:32.620- 26:34.780* :  potentially with an eye on setting a precedent
*26:34.780- 26:38.180* :  as the industry does develop more towards those socials
*26:38.360- 26:41.860* :  so it will be really interesting to see how it plays out today
*26:42.220- 26:43.300* :  and into tomorrow.
*26:44.060- 26:44.940* :  Stephanie Prentice.
*26:45.720- 26:47.880* :  A two-year-old boy from Glasgow in Scotland
*26:47.880- 26:51.880* :  is thought to be the youngest person ever to reach ever his base camp.
*26:51.880- 26:56.440* :  That's about 5,364 metres above sea level.
*26:57.040- 26:59.960* :  Young Carter Dallas completed the trek with his mum and dad,
*27:00.400- 27:01.580* :  Jade and Ross Dallas,
*27:01.920- 27:03.880* :  were on a year-long trip around Asia.
*27:04.360- 27:07.360* :  For the first two days, Jade's carried him
*27:07.560- 27:09.120* :  and I had a lot of luggage,
*27:09.980- 27:11.720* :  which was a lot heavier than Carter.
*27:11.720- 27:15.240* :  So after two days, we arranged a porter.
*27:15.240- 27:18.580* :  So I would then take Carter and the porter would take the bags.
*27:18.840- 27:20.540* :  And was there anything you were concerned about, like,
*27:20.760- 27:22.640* :  altitude sickness, that sort of thing?
*27:22.900- 27:25.500* :  We were always aware of the possibility.
*27:25.500- 27:27.600* :  So we'd agreed from the beginning
*27:27.600- 27:30.400* :  if there was any signs of altitude sickness.
*27:30.400- 27:32.560* :  We would happily just call it a day and turn back.
*27:32.780- 27:36.300* :  But we were absolutely fine and Carter had the checks on the way.
*27:36.480- 27:40.380* :  He actually grew in confidence and got stronger, more energetic
*27:40.380- 27:42.440* :  because we actually got to be about more tired.
*27:42.640- 27:45.200* :  And that moment when you get that, that moment of triumph,
*27:45.200- 27:48.320* :  presumably Carter didn't entirely share it.
*27:48.320- 27:51.660* :  I mean, did he realise why mum and dad were so excited?
*27:51.900- 27:55.040* :  He would see us celebrating and he was just jumping about having
*27:55.340- 27:57.780* :  the biggest smile on his face and enjoying then in the front.
*27:58.220- 28:02.460* :  Carter is very much to get involved in whatever's going on.
*28:02.460- 28:06.100* :  You know, we encourage him to participate in everything and anything.
*28:06.100- 28:07.600* :  And that's why we thought,
*28:08.080- 28:09.560* :  we'll try every day to base camp.
*28:09.700- 28:12.300* :  This wasn't to prove anything to anyone.
*28:12.300- 28:17.180* :  We simply done this because as a family, we felt it was right for us.
*28:17.320- 28:20.140* :  And you have some incredible thighs, some incredible memories, I guess.
*28:20.340- 28:23.920* :  One thing we had read that we knew there was going to be some controversy.
*28:23.920- 28:26.960* :  And as people saying that Carter will never remember it,
*28:27.160- 28:29.660* :  I think it's a bit of a silly statement because for us,
*28:29.660- 28:31.020* :  it's about living in the moment.
*28:31.080- 28:33.100* :  It's not about Carter remembering it or not.
*28:33.280- 28:35.420* :  If that was the case, you wouldn't do anything with your child.
*28:35.540- 28:37.580* :  It's a special opportunity that we have
*28:37.860- 28:40.320* :  getting to take a year away from our work and travel.
*28:41.500- 28:45.540* :  And that was Ross and Jay Dallas speaking there to James Coppill.
*28:46.780- 28:50.560* :  Now to one of the greatest songs in one of the greatest musicals.
*29:06.400- 29:10.060* :  The Song America from the famous musical West Side Story.
*29:10.400- 29:12.120* :  And we're playing it because Chita Rivera,
*29:12.120- 29:17.120* :  one of Broadway's most celebrated stars, has died at the age of 91.
*29:17.800- 29:22.920* :  Chita Rivera will forever be linked to the original stage role of key cast member Anita.
*29:23.520- 29:28.620* :  And we'd see her career span in the seven decades of singing, dancing and acting.
*29:28.620- 29:32.880* :  Chita Rivera's daughter, Lisa Maudenty, released a statement saying
*29:32.880- 29:36.820* :  her mother had died peacefully in New York after a brief illness.
*29:37.500- 29:40.000* :  Of mixed Puerto Rican and Scottish Irish heritage,
*29:40.000- 29:44.740* :  Chita Rivera was regarded as a trailblazer for Latina women in the arts.
*29:45.140- 29:47.940* :  And seen by many as a true Broadway legend.
*29:48.680- 29:53.060* :  Tony Basel, a friend of Chita Rivera's and a US singer actress and choreographer
*29:53.060- 29:58.320* :  in her own right, spoke to the BBC's Victoria Oon Kunda about Chita's legacy.
*29:58.840- 30:02.280* :  I met her in 1963.
*30:03.600- 30:05.600* :  I had just gotten out of high school.
*30:05.600- 30:11.120* :  I'd come to Los Angeles and I auditioned for the Broadway show,
*30:11.120- 30:18.540* :  which they were remounting with almost a complete original cast of West Side Story,
*30:19.280- 30:23.220* :  which I'm not sure if your audience knows.
*30:23.220- 30:28.260* :  I know they know of the Anita in West Side Story,
*30:28.520- 30:34.120* :  but Rita Marino won the Oscar for it, Ariana DeBoss won the Oscar for it.
*30:34.600- 30:38.740* :  Chita did the original Broadway show, that character.
*30:39.400- 30:42.840* :  And when they remounted it in Los Angeles,
*30:42.840- 30:48.440* :  which was after the Broadway show, closed after the movie premiered,
*30:49.100- 30:53.160* :  they remounted it with almost a complete original cast.
*30:54.320- 30:56.220* :  And she was Chita Rivera.
*30:57.340- 31:03.660* :  And she was doing the role that she originated Anita in West Side Story.
*31:04.220- 31:08.920* :  And I got to be in the same show as Chita Rivera.
*31:08.920- 31:15.640* :  And I used to stand on the side of the stage in the wings and watch every move she made.
*31:16.600- 31:20.020* :  Everything she did, she was so phenomenal.
*31:20.360- 31:25.200* :  You happen to have been one of the many people who shared this stage with her
*31:25.240- 31:27.980* :  who was in her presence working together.
*31:28.720- 31:29.940* :  What made her stand out?
*31:30.640- 31:36.360* :  Well, she was just a unique, dynamic talent.
*31:36.400- 31:41.780* :  She was, her persona was unique.
*31:42.660- 31:44.940* :  There was no one like her.
*31:45.520- 31:49.800* :  I was lucky enough to do the show again.
*31:50.780- 31:55.340* :  This time, I auditioned for Anita in West Side Story.
*31:56.040- 31:57.180* :  And I got the role.
*31:57.360- 32:01.180* :  When somebody, I did it in San Diego with a small company.
*32:01.280- 32:04.100* :  And when people say, oh, I made the role my own.
*32:04.400- 32:07.300* :  No, I did not make the role my own.
*32:08.000- 32:12.480* :  I imitated every, every morsel of what I saw.
*32:13.160- 32:14.960* :  Chita do on the stage.
*32:15.280- 32:17.020* :  I think I said the lines the same.
*32:17.440- 32:19.360* :  I tried to dance the same.
*32:19.800- 32:21.220* :  I wore my hair the same.
*32:21.280- 32:24.540* :  I did everything the same as Chita.
*32:24.860- 32:27.120* :  I figured, you know, she got it right.
*32:27.540- 32:31.840* :  And why I better try to just imitate her so I get it right there.
*32:32.160- 32:35.220* :  I know that I say she was an actress, a singer, and a dancer.
*32:35.820- 32:41.660* :  But her style of performance and as a performer, she was so dynamic.
*32:42.400- 32:49.040* :  And dancers just, they always stay somehow emotionally in touch.
*32:49.720- 32:50.520* :  It's physical.
*32:50.520- 32:55.140* :  As a singer, you know, we can all sing in the bathroom and echo.
*32:55.580- 32:58.140* :  You know, we don't need to go to a studio.
*32:58.940- 32:59.660* :  We can sing.
*33:00.200- 33:02.620* :  With acting, you kind of read your lines.
*33:02.620- 33:04.560* :  And you learn them at home.
*33:05.480- 33:08.000* :  But with dancing, you need that big room.
*33:08.160- 33:09.560* :  And you need that dance floor.
*33:09.960- 33:12.080* :  And you need to get there to that studio.
*33:12.080- 33:17.400* :  And there's something about the journey that we all have in common.
*33:18.120- 33:22.800* :  And when I say it keeps you grounded, it keeps you grounded.
*33:22.800- 33:24.640* :  It creeps, it keeps you humble.
*33:25.160- 33:28.620* :  And she was always so wonderful and humble.
*33:29.420- 33:32.380* :  And she was just an extraordinary person.
*33:33.200- 33:37.440* :  And that was Tony Bazel on Chita Rivera, who's died at the age of 91.
*33:39.740- 33:41.900* :  And that's it from us for an hour, but there'll be a new edition
*33:41.900- 33:43.480* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
