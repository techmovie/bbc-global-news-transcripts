*00:50.660- 00:54.040* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:54.460- 00:57.060* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.060- 01:02.520* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t?

*01:25.200- 01:28.420* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Monday
*01:28.420- 01:33.560* :  the 8th of January. I witnesses say dozens of civilians have been killed in an Israeli attack
*01:33.560- 01:38.960* :  on a house in northern Gaza. A defiant Israeli Prime Minister says the war will go on.
*01:40.400- 01:44.680* :  We are not stopping until we achieve all of its goals. The elimination of Hamas,
*01:44.680- 01:49.700* :  the return of all our hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.
*01:50.260- 01:54.760* :  Israel also denies Al Jazeera's claims that it's targeting journalists in Gaza.
*01:55.540- 01:59.940* :  The Bangladeshi Prime Minister wins a fifth term in office after a boycott by the opposition.
*02:00.300- 02:08.340* :  If Bangladesh ruling party awamely continues like this, this country may be a second North Korea.
*02:08.980- 02:14.460* :  And the EU welcomes the resolution of a car number plate dispute between Serbia and Kosovo.
*02:17.180- 02:22.540* :  Also in the podcast, our new running shoes giving athletes an unfair advantage. And
*02:29.680- 02:33.600* :  the song propelled back into the UK charts after more than 20 years.
*02:38.100- 02:44.520* :  According to Hamas, nearly 23,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its offensive
*02:44.520- 02:50.880* :  there. More than 100 in airstrikes in the past day. But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*02:51.160- 02:56.040* :  has told his war cabinet that the fighting will go on until all his government's goals have been
*02:56.040- 03:00.800* :  achieved. His comments come amid growing frustration and anger at the sheer number of civilian
*03:00.800- 03:05.720* :  casualties in the Palestinian territory. From Jerusalem, we're a Davis sent this report.
*03:08.720- 03:14.540* :  Images coming in from Jabalya in Northern Gaza today show bodies lying in the rubble of a
*03:14.540- 03:20.580* :  destroyed building. Many of them are women and children. And confirmed reports say at least 70 people
*03:20.580- 03:25.780* :  were killed in what was reported to be an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military has not
*03:25.780- 03:32.460* :  responded to a BBC request for more information. Another 63 people were also reportedly killed
*03:32.460- 03:39.760* :  in 7 Gaza in the town of Han Unis. As Israel continues to target what it says is Hamas infrastructure
*03:39.760- 03:46.100* :  across the territory. Indeed, despite mounting international pressure over the rising number of
*03:46.100- 03:52.260* :  casualties and the possibility of a wider regional conflict, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*03:52.660- 04:00.320* :  remains defiant. We are not stopping until victory. The war must not be stopped until we achieve all
*04:00.320- 04:05.580* :  of its goals. The elimination of Hamas, the return of all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza
*04:05.820- 04:11.340* :  no longer poses a threat to Israel. I say this to both our enemies and our friends. And we must
*04:11.340- 04:18.820* :  continue until total victory. As Netanyahu spoke, the American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*04:18.820- 04:24.900* :  continued his tour of Middle Eastern capitals. We're increasingly frustrated and occasionally
*04:24.900- 04:30.400* :  our rate regional leaders have been urging him to use Washington's influence with Israel
*04:30.840- 04:38.280* :  to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. We're a Davis in Jerusalem. Among the latest fatalities were two
*04:38.280- 04:43.520* :  Palestinian reporters killed when their car was hit by a drone strike in the south near Rafa.
*04:44.220- 04:51.620* :  One was Hamza El-Dadu, eldest son of Al-Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief, while Al-Dadu. He had already lost
*04:51.620- 04:57.340* :  his wife and two other children in a strike in October. Al-Jazeera accused Israel of targeting
*04:57.340- 05:03.060* :  journalists and, quote, violating the principles of freedom of the press, while spoken his son's funeral
*05:03.060- 05:12.200* :  on Sunday. The world should see with its own eyes and not Israel's eye. They have to listen and see
*05:12.200- 05:18.760* :  everything that's happening to the Palestinian people. What did Hamza do to Israel? What did the
*05:18.760- 05:25.340* :  family do to them? What did the civilians in the Gaza strip do to them? Well, on his stop-off in
*05:25.340- 05:30.660* :  Qatar, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said he would raise the need to better protect
*05:30.660- 05:35.820* :  civilians when he heads to Israel this week. He described the deaths of the journalists as an
*05:35.820- 05:42.960* :  unimaginable tragedy. The committee to protect journalists has found that now some 70 journalists
*05:42.960- 05:49.600* :  have been killed in Gaza. One is far too many, and the value that we place upon their work,
*05:50.200- 05:57.740* :  information, facts to the world has never been more important. This is why we are pressing the need,
*05:58.500- 06:04.000* :  not only of making sure that humanitarian assistance can get to people who need it, but that people
*06:04.000- 06:10.200* :  are protected from harm from this conflict in the first place. Mark Ragev, a senior advisor to
*06:10.200- 06:15.420* :  the Israeli Prime Minister said Israel was not to blame for the killings. Israel does not deliberately
*06:15.420- 06:19.340* :  target journalists. We are the only country in the Middle East that actually does have a free press,
*06:19.340- 06:24.220* :  where the only country in the entire region where the press can write bad things and criticize
*06:24.840- 06:28.380* :  the leaders of government. That cannot happen, and I don't think in any other Middle East,
*06:28.380- 06:31.820* :  in country, and to say that Israel, the liberally targets the press is ridiculous,
*06:31.820- 06:34.080* :  with only country that actually enshrines a free press.
*06:34.700- 06:38.680* :  Civilians casualties are enemies Hamas, not the population of Gaza.
*06:39.400- 06:44.280* :  Having said that, if anyone thinks an immediate ceasefire unconditional is going to solve anything,
*06:44.280- 06:49.340* :  it's an illusion. Any ceasefire that leaves Hamas in power just takes us all back to square one,
*06:49.340- 06:52.680* :  will be fighting another Gaza war in six months or in a year.
*06:53.060- 06:56.180* :  Israeli government advisor Mark Ragev talking to the BBC.
*06:56.180- 07:00.360* :  To no one's surprise, the election in Bangladesh has been won by the Prime Minister,
*07:00.360- 07:04.440* :  Sheikh Hasina, securing her a fifth term in office and a fourth in a row.
*07:04.880- 07:08.240* :  The poll was boycotted by the main opposition party, the BNP.
*07:08.600- 07:13.500* :  Turnout is estimated to be as low as 40%, compared to 80% in 2018.
*07:14.480- 07:16.820* :  In her most recent 14-year stint in charge,
*07:16.820- 07:22.280* :  Hasina has presided over huge economic growth in what was once one of the world's poorest nations.
*07:22.300- 07:27.580* :  But her government has also been accused of human rights abuses and a crackdown on the opposition.
*07:28.020- 07:29.560* :  This is something she denies.
*07:39.740- 07:44.640* :  But the opposition said the way the poll had been conducted was a disgrace to the democratic
*07:44.640- 07:49.340* :  aspirations of Bangladesh. Abel Moyen Khan is a senior member of the BNP party.
*07:50.180- 07:55.260* :  It's a shame that after 52 years of independence of Bangladesh,
*07:56.040- 08:00.280* :  we now have to fight for democracy inside Bangladesh.
*08:00.740- 08:04.720* :  If Bangladesh ruling party, I want me to continue like this,
*08:05.260- 08:10.200* :  this country may be turning into a second North Korea.
*08:10.740- 08:14.700* :  Our South Asia correspondent, Samira Hussein, is in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka.
*08:14.700- 08:16.860* :  She spoke to my colleague, Luqueza Burak.
*08:17.060- 08:22.280* :  We do know that the Avwami League party led by the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina,
*08:22.280- 08:26.540* :  has crossed that threshold of winning a clear majority.
*08:26.540- 08:30.980* :  Now, just how strong that majority is is still being worked out.
*08:31.100- 08:36.800* :  That said, this is an election that pretty much everyone knew what the result was going to be
*08:36.800- 08:38.560* :  before votes were cast.
*08:38.620- 08:44.220* :  And that's because the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist party,
*08:44.640- 08:46.220* :  were boycotting these elections.
*08:46.220- 08:51.620* :  So when you look in terms of the choices that voters had when casting their ballots,
*08:51.620- 08:57.880* :  it was either vote for the Avwami League or vote for the independent candidates
*08:57.880- 09:01.460* :  and an overwhelming majority of those independent candidates,
*09:02.020- 09:04.720* :  were supporters of the ruling government.
*09:04.900- 09:07.520* :  Samira, what's the atmosphere like in the country at the moment?
*09:07.520- 09:10.700* :  Because when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina cast her vote,
*09:10.700- 09:14.440* :  she described that main opposition party as a terrorist organisation.
*09:14.460- 09:19.740* :  There are reports of the government cracking down on dissents strongly.
*09:20.480- 09:28.380* :  If you are a member of any opposition party that is speaking out against the ruling government,
*09:28.380- 09:33.920* :  you're probably going to be in a position where it's going to be very difficult
*09:33.920- 09:39.480* :  to exercise your democratic freedom to protest or make speeches freely.
*09:39.480- 09:43.200* :  And this is something that has been documented by human rights groups.
*09:43.840- 09:47.140* :  And that was part of the argument made by the BNP,
*09:47.140- 09:52.400* :  saying that so many of their leaders and supporters are in prison right now,
*09:52.400- 09:58.200* :  or they're in hiding because the crackdown on free expression has just been so severe.
*09:58.920- 10:03.840* :  But when you speak with members of the government, in fact, I spoke with the foreign minister today,
*10:04.420- 10:07.740* :  and he said, look, these elections were free and fair.
*10:07.740- 10:14.860* :  You had international observers that came and they reported that these elections were not rigged.
*10:15.340- 10:20.600* :  But the BNP said that, look, for them to be responsible to their supporters,
*10:20.600- 10:26.880* :  they couldn't actually participate in these elections because of this crackdown
*10:27.340- 10:32.860* :  on any kind of free speech in a protest back in October of last year.
*10:33.340- 10:37.400* :  More than 10,000 of their supporters and leaders were arrested,
*10:37.400- 10:39.320* :  and that's according to human rights watch.
*10:39.840- 10:42.980* :  Some error her saying in Bangladesh talking to Luqués at Borrag.
*10:43.580- 10:47.860* :  For more than two years, Serbia and Kosovo have been locked in a sometimes violent dispute
*10:47.860- 10:52.680* :  over car number plates. The rouse threatened to tear apart the fragile peace in the region.
*10:53.120- 10:55.900* :  Now it seems the two sides have quietly reached a resolution.
*10:55.900- 10:59.140* :  The European Union's foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrel,
*10:59.140- 11:02.160* :  said it was a positive step towards normalising relations.
*11:02.160- 11:06.700* :  Our Balkans' correspondent, Guy Deloni, told me what the disagreement was all about,
*11:06.700- 11:07.980* :  and how it was resolved.
*11:08.480- 11:12.840* :  Serbia does not recognise Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence,
*11:12.840- 11:14.180* :  which happened in 2008.
*11:14.700- 11:17.740* :  So, of course, Serbia doesn't recognise or didn't recognise
*11:18.500- 11:20.680* :  Kosovo's vehicle license plates either.
*11:21.280- 11:26.160* :  Complicating factor to that was that you've got tens of thousands of ethnic
*11:26.160- 11:29.560* :  servs who live in what is now the northern part of Kosovo,
*11:29.660- 11:33.540* :  and they were continuing to use Serbian license plates,
*11:33.540- 11:37.300* :  which had the initials of towns in North Kosovo.
*11:37.660- 11:42.200* :  So, all of this was causing distinct tensions between Belgrade and Prostina.
*11:42.620- 11:46.180* :  Prostina for the past two and a half years or so has been insisting
*11:46.500- 11:50.620* :  that these ethnic servs should swap their Serbian issued number plates
*11:50.920- 11:52.760* :  for the Republic of Kosovo number plates.
*11:53.240- 11:57.400* :  They were resisting in the north of Kosovo sometimes with barricades,
*11:57.400- 12:00.260* :  and we saw some violent flare-ups over the past couple of years
*12:00.720- 12:02.320* :  surrounding those barricades.
*12:02.560- 12:05.820* :  And there was also the issue, of course, of whether people with Kosovo number plates
*12:06.220- 12:09.960* :  will be allowed to drive in Serbia, and we have had thudges over the years
*12:09.960- 12:13.080* :  involving stickers over national insignia and such like,
*12:13.520- 12:17.280* :  but now the resolution has been reached somewhat quietly and without much fanfare.
*12:17.500- 12:19.460* :  Yeah, without much fanfare, tell us what it involves.
*12:20.480- 12:23.600* :  If you're driving now with a Republic of Kosovo number plate,
*12:23.600- 12:27.640* :  you can drive in Serbia without having to put a sticker over anything,
*12:28.100- 12:31.320* :  and likewise, if you're driving into Kosovo from Serbia,
*12:31.320- 12:35.260* :  you don't have to obscure the Serbian insignia on your number plate.
*12:35.840- 12:39.220* :  The other thing that's happened is that people in North Kosovo,
*12:39.240- 12:43.440* :  again, quite quietly, when the last deadline came around in December,
*12:43.920- 12:46.500* :  they swapped their number plates a lot of people
*12:46.960- 12:50.400* :  for Republic of Kosovo number plates because the Serbian government didn't raise
*12:50.400- 12:51.140* :  any objections.
*12:51.140- 12:53.140* :  Guadalani in Belgrade.
*12:53.780- 12:58.060* :  Now she's only 25, but Afghanistan's first female commercial pilot
*12:58.060- 13:01.600* :  has experienced some amazing highs and lows.
*13:02.220- 13:07.220* :  Myadese Mirzae made history in 2020 when she became the first woman
*13:07.220- 13:09.240* :  in Afghanistan to fly an airliner.
*13:09.640- 13:13.900* :  Less than a year later, the Taliban take over turn the trailblazing pilot
*13:13.900- 13:16.760* :  into a refugee forced to flee for her survival.
*13:17.400- 13:20.240* :  She's been speaking to the BBC's Janet Gillil about her ordeal
*13:20.240- 13:21.940* :  and how she's rebuilding her life.
*13:22.680- 13:24.780* :  I never thought I would become a refugee, like,
*13:25.360- 13:29.400* :  whenever I came a pilot, it was a big proud moment for everyone in Afghanistan,
*13:29.400- 13:31.720* :  for Afghanistan, for me, for my family.
*13:31.960- 13:33.560* :  We didn't have any woman in aviation.
*13:34.020- 13:37.500* :  And now we had women in aviation, so I was very hopeful about future
*13:37.640- 13:39.580* :  and you're like, we are going in the right direction.
*13:39.880- 13:45.300* :  A male-dominated Afghanistan, it took grit, persistence, and hard work for Mojadesi Mirzae
*13:45.300- 13:49.740* :  to fulfill her dream of becoming the country's first female airline pilot.
*13:50.360- 13:53.500* :  But less than a year later, the Taliban roared into Kabul,
*13:53.500- 13:54.960* :  shattering her dreams.
*13:55.520- 13:57.840* :  She'd left home that morning telling her mother and sisters
*13:57.840- 13:59.740* :  she'd be back for breakfast the next day.
*14:00.380- 14:03.380* :  But at the airport, her news broke of the Taliban takeover,
*14:03.780- 14:06.580* :  hundreds of terrified people stormed onto the wrong ways.
*14:07.180- 14:11.200* :  Some were so desperate to flee that they clung onto the sides of planes taking off.
*14:12.000- 14:15.320* :  Mojadesi helped foreign pilots get onto an evacuation flight,
*14:15.780- 14:18.660* :  but then she was told her own life was in danger too.
*14:19.280- 14:21.580* :  We got to that aircraft and they told me, okay, come on in.
*14:22.140- 14:23.760* :  I can't. What do you mean, come on in?
*14:23.900- 14:24.720* :  This is my country.
*14:25.240- 14:26.800* :  I cannot leave my family behind.
*14:26.800- 14:28.700* :  Like, we are all women, we stick together.
*14:29.160- 14:32.860* :  Initially, Mojadesi was flown to Ukraine, but she was denied entry.
*14:33.280- 14:36.600* :  Months later, Ukraine would be plunged into its own refugee crisis.
*14:37.240- 14:40.720* :  She ended up in Bulgaria, but once there, she sank into a depression,
*14:41.280- 14:44.300* :  having lost her job, her home, and her family.
*14:44.760- 14:47.000* :  Like, one day I just woke up and I looked at the mirror.
*14:47.060- 14:49.480* :  I was crying all the time and I looked at her and I was like,
*14:49.960- 14:50.800* :  this is not you.
*14:50.800- 14:53.780* :  You fought so much in Afghanistan to become a pilot.
*14:54.300- 14:56.140* :  One more time, try it again.
*14:56.140- 14:59.620* :  My fingers are strong, they're courageous and they don't give up easily.
*15:00.020- 15:02.060* :  It took a paper and a pen and I wrote them.
*15:02.260- 15:05.540* :  On the 15th of August, I lost my job, I lost my dreams,
*15:05.540- 15:06.900* :  and I left the country.
*15:07.500- 15:09.460* :  Next year, on the 15th of August,
*15:10.200- 15:12.100* :  I will be in the cockpit and I will be flying,
*15:12.520- 15:14.260* :  to show them that they cannot stop us.
*15:14.560- 15:17.120* :  And one year to the day after the Taliban takeover,
*15:17.120- 15:19.360* :  she was back in the skies as a pilot.
*15:19.660- 15:22.880* :  And on the next year, this exact same day,
*15:22.880- 15:24.800* :  I took back my hope.
*15:25.100- 15:26.200* :  I fought for my dreams.
*15:26.200- 15:28.480* :  I fought for Afghan girls and I took it back.
*15:28.720- 15:29.900* :  And I felt amazing.
*15:30.860- 15:33.600* :  But Mohadesi is still barred from flying outside Europe
*15:33.600- 15:35.360* :  partly because of security concerns.
*15:36.200- 15:38.140* :  And every time she goes through passport control,
*15:38.140- 15:41.920* :  the pilot is reminded that she is also a refugee.
*15:42.520- 15:45.240* :  I have my uniform on and it's very like, respectfully uniform.
*15:45.780- 15:47.880* :  Then I go to the security control and they're like,
*15:47.880- 15:49.640* :  okay, passport is on everyone gives their passport.
*15:49.640- 15:51.740* :  Okay, it comes to me and they look at it, they're like,
*15:52.020- 15:53.120* :  you're from Afghanistan.
*15:53.900- 15:55.500* :  Yes sir, you're a refugee.
*15:55.980- 15:57.800* :  Yes sir, you're a pilot.
*15:58.660- 15:59.060* :  Yes sir.
*15:59.680- 16:01.060* :  I had interesting reactions.
*16:01.980- 16:03.100* :  I'll talk about the good ones.
*16:04.060- 16:06.040* :  They asked me these questions and then they look at me,
*16:06.040- 16:09.740* :  the tearful eyes, but also like, they're happy for me
*16:10.260- 16:11.260* :  and they're proud of it.
*16:11.760- 16:13.440* :  And they look at me like, bravo.
*16:13.840- 16:15.060* :  And they're just like, come on in ma.
*16:15.800- 16:17.580* :  And do you want to tell me about the more negative reactions?
*16:19.220- 16:21.180* :  Like, rest of our pilots, they would just pass
*16:21.180- 16:25.360* :  and it's just me standing there and they're asking for extra ideas.
*16:25.580- 16:28.300* :  And sometimes I'm like, what else can I give you?
*16:28.500- 16:29.860* :  Since the day she fled the Taliban,
*16:29.860- 16:32.960* :  Mohydesi has only seen her mother and sisters in video calls.
*16:32.960- 16:35.120* :  They managed to escape to Canada.
*16:35.800- 16:37.660* :  But as refugees, they can't come to Europe
*16:37.660- 16:39.360* :  and she can't go to Canada.
*16:39.700- 16:40.900* :  I haven't seen them for two years.
*16:41.460- 16:43.720* :  I know I am an adult and I can manage it by myself,
*16:43.720- 16:46.220* :  but being away from family,
*16:46.220- 16:48.640* :  the family that you were always so attached to.
*16:48.680- 16:50.080* :  Like, even when I talk about it now,
*16:50.120- 16:51.980* :  I could cry because I miss them very much.
*16:53.160- 16:56.300* :  Mohydesi, Mishayi, talking to Jenat Gillil.
*16:56.680- 16:58.740* :  The pioneering British transplant surgeon,
*16:58.740- 17:01.360* :  Sir Roy Khan, has died at the age of 93.
*17:01.360- 17:03.620* :  He performed thousands of transplants
*17:03.620- 17:06.860* :  and was instrumental in the introduction of immunosuppressant drugs,
*17:07.360- 17:09.220* :  which helped prolong the lives of his patients.
*17:09.220- 17:11.120* :  Francis Reed looks back at his life.
*17:11.760- 17:16.620* :  Sir Roy Khan started his medical training at the age of just 16 in London.
*17:16.920- 17:19.520* :  He'd wanted to be a surgeon since he was a boy
*17:19.520- 17:24.300* :  and he went on to perform a series of world firsts for transplant medicine.
*17:24.300- 17:29.920* :  It was in 1968 that he led the UK's first liver transplant in Cambridge.
*17:30.380- 17:34.580* :  Ten years later, he was the first doctor to use an immunosuppressant
*17:34.860- 17:36.340* :  to reduce organ rejection.
*17:37.100- 17:38.420* :  Less than a decade after that,
*17:38.420- 17:41.920* :  he conducted the earliest ever liver heart and lung transplants
*17:42.300- 17:44.940* :  and in the mid-90s another world first.
*17:44.940- 17:49.120* :  Transplanting stomach, intestine, pancreas liver and kidney,
*17:49.600- 17:50.820* :  all at the same time.
*17:51.420- 17:52.880* :  Speaking to the BBC then,
*17:52.880- 17:57.340* :  he said that some of his ideas had initially been dismissed as impossible.
*17:57.660- 18:00.720* :  It's not only the medical profession, I think it's human nature.
*18:01.080- 18:05.320* :  If you're used to something and it works and it's not too bad as far as you're concerned,
*18:05.320- 18:07.440* :  you don't want anybody rocking the boat.
*18:07.700- 18:10.260* :  People who rock the boat are usually regarded as dangerous.
*18:10.880- 18:14.160* :  They may in fact need dangerous and it's best to suppress them.
*18:14.320- 18:16.300* :  You've been regarded as dangerous in your time, have you?
*18:16.380- 18:18.100* :  Yes, I think, probably still so.
*18:19.080- 18:22.360* :  As well as an extensive career and a fellowship at Harvard,
*18:22.360- 18:25.140* :  he was also known for painting his patients
*18:25.140- 18:28.540* :  as a way to break down barriers and remove fear for them.
*18:28.880- 18:31.480* :  He was so well regarded that a hospital in Cambridge
*18:31.480- 18:34.280* :  named its transplant unit after Sir Roy
*18:34.620- 18:36.740* :  as an international centre of excellence.
*18:37.240- 18:40.840* :  Francis Reed on the life of pioneering transplant surgeon Sir Roy Camp
*18:40.840- 18:42.800* :  who's died at the age of 93.
*18:45.960- 18:47.940* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*18:47.980- 18:51.900* :  What I take issue with is this central premise that we're all supposed to feel
*18:51.900- 18:56.240* :  that the people gathered in Davos are pursuing social goals
*18:56.240- 18:58.480* :  that are universally applicable.
*18:58.480- 19:00.480* :  They're going there to do business and make deals.
*19:01.340- 19:03.780* :  Ahead of the annual get-together in Davos,
*19:03.780- 19:07.240* :  we ask what is the world economic forum all about?
*19:16.100- 19:19.200* :  The general election in the Democratic Republic of Congo in December
*19:19.200- 19:23.040* :  was dogged by delays, logistical challenges and allegations of fraud.
*19:23.040- 19:27.520* :  About 100,000 candidates were standing in the polls for different posts.
*19:28.060- 19:29.600* :  The only result announced so far,
*19:29.600- 19:33.120* :  a landslide victory for the incumbent President Felix Chisikedi
*19:33.120- 19:34.840* :  has been widely disputed.
*19:35.580- 19:38.560* :  While Congo waits to see the outcome of the other elections,
*19:38.560- 19:42.320* :  the UN's top human rights expert has expressed serious concern
*19:42.320- 19:45.080* :  about a rise in hate speech and calls for violence,
*19:45.080- 19:48.140* :  as I heard from my Africa Regional Editor, David Bamford.
*19:48.700- 19:52.300* :  In many ways, the presidential election itself was the easy part,
*19:52.300- 19:54.740* :  what also happened on December the 20th
*19:54.780- 19:57.380* :  were all the legislative and local elections,
*19:57.560- 19:59.720* :  and that's where the concern is,
*19:59.720- 20:01.860* :  because the results have not yet been declared.
*20:01.860- 20:05.140* :  And that's where the violence is more likely to take place.
*20:05.480- 20:09.300* :  And this message from Volker Turk is really about what he fears will happen
*20:09.780- 20:12.960* :  as the election results start to be announced locally.
*20:13.380- 20:17.160* :  Yeah, and just remind us of the potential for trouble in Congo.
*20:17.160- 20:21.100* :  It is a huge country and lots of different ethnic groups live there.
*20:21.380- 20:26.680* :  To run an election in a country such as Congo with 250 ethnic groups
*20:26.680- 20:30.640* :  with all the rivalries, with the civil war going on in the east,
*20:30.960- 20:33.340* :  it's going to be difficult in any case.
*20:33.540- 20:36.400* :  And in particular, places like North and South Kivu,
*20:36.780- 20:40.080* :  where there's the M-23 rebels and other rebel groups
*20:40.700- 20:43.240* :  stirring up the situation, Kazai and Katango,
*20:43.240- 20:45.180* :  well known for violence in the past.
*20:45.460- 20:46.580* :  They've really got the hands full.
*20:46.900- 20:49.660* :  I mean, the election chief Dennis Kadema is doing all he can
*20:49.660- 20:51.440* :  to try and keep things calm,
*20:51.440- 20:55.580* :  but really he's in a very difficult situation.
*20:55.640- 20:58.260* :  David Bamford, our Africa Regional Editor.
*20:59.080- 21:02.160* :  It is less than two years since Emmanuel Macron was re-elected
*21:02.160- 21:05.360* :  as French presidents, but already there's talk that his power is beginning
*21:05.360- 21:06.140* :  to ebb away.
*21:06.140- 21:09.680* :  He's not able to stand in the next election due in 2027
*21:09.680- 21:13.060* :  when the far right leader, Marine Le Pen, will be hoping to succeed him.
*21:13.160- 21:17.020* :  Johnny Diamond, our Sophie Peder, Paris bureau chief for the economist,
*21:17.400- 21:18.780* :  what's gone wrong for Mr. Macron?
*21:19.040- 21:22.360* :  He failed to win a majority at parliamentary elections
*21:22.360- 21:26.540* :  and every single piece of legislation since the elections of 2022
*21:26.540- 21:30.180* :  has had to be passed either by forcing it through parliament
*21:30.180- 21:32.360* :  using a sort of override clause
*21:32.580- 21:36.660* :  or ad hoc stitching together of votes and coalitions
*21:36.660- 21:38.440* :  that last as long as the vote does.
*21:38.700- 21:42.060* :  There is talk of perhaps a cabinet reshuffle,
*21:42.060- 21:44.580* :  perhaps a new prime minister.
*21:44.940- 21:45.480* :  Will that help?
*21:45.740- 21:47.700* :  It will be a chance to reset, you know,
*21:47.720- 21:52.340* :  but that's all limited within the context of having no parliamentary
*21:52.340- 21:55.560* :  majority, which will continue to make life difficult for him.
*21:55.900- 21:58.760* :  Sophie Peder of the economist will mark for actually
*21:58.760- 22:01.360* :  is the vice president of Emmanuel Macron's party
*22:01.360- 22:02.400* :  in the French parliament.
*22:02.400- 22:05.020* :  He's also an old friend and was best man at his wedding.
*22:05.020- 22:07.620* :  Does he feel gloomy about the next three years?
*22:08.300- 22:11.180* :  I don't because I think there is still rumour
*22:11.300- 22:13.260* :  for president Macron to govern.
*22:13.260- 22:15.800* :  It's definitely not a lame duck president.
*22:16.380- 22:20.060* :  More than 50 bills have been passed since the general election
*22:20.660- 22:23.480* :  and that shows that the majority stick together.
*22:23.700- 22:25.080* :  So I'm not pessimistic.
*22:25.420- 22:27.400* :  We have achieved some good results,
*22:28.080- 22:31.540* :  but there are many factors in the French society.
*22:32.160- 22:36.440* :  We have seen that last July when there were riots in the country.
*22:37.020- 22:38.560* :  But we have also assets,
*22:39.160- 22:41.280* :  the strengths of the French economies and assets.
*22:41.440- 22:44.160* :  And I think that there is still resilience
*22:44.640- 22:46.560* :  of the French society as a whole.
*22:47.340- 22:49.280* :  When I was traveling around the country
*22:49.740- 22:53.740* :  during the election campaign, it was very clear there was a big gap
*22:53.840- 22:58.000* :  that they felt a sense of disconnect between Paris
*22:58.500- 23:00.420* :  and much of the rest of the country.
*23:00.700- 23:04.700* :  Do you think that Mr. Macron has been successful in bridging the gap
*23:04.700- 23:07.640* :  between the government and the government?
*23:07.640- 23:10.080* :  Because many have suggested again
*23:10.080- 23:12.980* :  that he has been part of the problem there.
*23:13.280- 23:15.600* :  There is an anger which is directed towards
*23:15.600- 23:16.900* :  president Macron France.
*23:17.360- 23:19.140* :  You raise a very important issue.
*23:19.820- 23:22.700* :  We need to change people's lives everywhere in the country
*23:22.860- 23:25.220* :  and there are many parts of the French territory.
*23:25.220- 23:29.160* :  That obviously didn't see the results
*23:29.160- 23:32.260* :  that we have achieved and especially in big cities.
*23:32.720- 23:37.040* :  The fact that some people had this feeling of disconnection
*23:37.160- 23:39.340* :  is a very strong fuel,
*23:39.940- 23:42.100* :  especially for the extreme right party.
*23:42.540- 23:45.300* :  So I think that we need to achieve much more results
*23:45.300- 23:48.880* :  and to show that it's all reforms,
*23:48.880- 23:51.620* :  our actions that drive these results.
*23:52.180- 23:55.500* :  You mentioned the threat of the far right.
*23:56.240- 24:01.120* :  If in 2027 the presidency is taken by Marine Le Pen,
*24:01.120- 24:04.480* :  what kind of legacy is that for president Macron?
*24:04.960- 24:08.940* :  Well, we're going to do everything we can to avoid this.
*24:09.460- 24:10.700* :  Obviously, it would be a failure,
*24:10.980- 24:14.180* :  but I think that it's thought for being a certainty.
*24:14.760- 24:16.940* :  Mark Farracci talking to Johnny Diamond.
*24:17.660- 24:20.100* :  A new super shoe developed to shatter the world.
*24:20.100- 24:22.200* :  Marathon records sold out within minutes
*24:22.200- 24:23.820* :  of going on sale last week.
*24:24.440- 24:28.060* :  It was worn by Kenyan runner Kelvin Keptum in Chicago in October
*24:28.460- 24:30.160* :  when he became the first man to finish a marathon
*24:30.160- 24:32.000* :  in under two hours and one minute.
*24:32.000- 24:35.040* :  There was eight similar frenzy over another shoe,
*24:35.340- 24:38.820* :  worn by Tiggist Assefa who broke the women's world marathon record
*24:38.820- 24:40.240* :  in Berlin in September.
*24:40.820- 24:43.700* :  Cristianis is a UK sports journalist who covers athletics.
*24:43.700- 24:46.320* :  He's been considering whether so-called super shoes
*24:46.320- 24:49.140* :  are making life too easy for elite runners.
*24:49.820- 24:51.400* :  Surely now it's a question of when,
*24:51.400- 24:55.120* :  rather than if a marathon will be run legally in under two hours.
*24:55.740- 24:58.720* :  When the Kenyan Kelvin Keptum won in Chicago in October,
*24:59.260- 25:02.940* :  he moved the men's world record to within 35 seconds of the magic mark.
*25:03.520- 25:07.400* :  But he also locked an astonishing 34 seconds off the previous record
*25:07.400- 25:12.380* :  held by Elliott Keptchoghe, widely regarded as the greatest marathon runner in history.
*25:12.380- 25:15.380* :  Of the top 20 fastest marathon times in history,
*25:15.380- 25:19.120* :  16 of the men's and 17 of the women's have been run
*25:19.440- 25:20.340* :  since 2019.
*25:21.080- 25:21.880* :  So what's happening here?
*25:22.200- 25:25.180* :  Our athletes getting fitter and stronger as well as quicker.
*25:25.840- 25:29.180* :  Quite possibly so, but the 2019 date is significant.
*25:29.740- 25:32.100* :  This marked the arrival of the so-called super shoe
*25:32.500- 25:34.060* :  which has revolutionised road running.
*25:34.060- 25:38.060* :  The carbon fiber plate embedded within a featherweight foam sole
*25:38.060- 25:41.100* :  produces more recoil on impact, giving the athlete
*25:41.100- 25:43.000* :  a greater energy return.
*25:43.660- 25:47.000* :  The super shoes allow athletes to train harder and recover more quickly.
*25:47.760- 25:50.940* :  Not surprisingly, the arrival of the super shoe has divided opinion.
*25:51.460- 25:54.680* :  Critics call it technological doping, plastic athletics,
*25:55.160- 25:57.440* :  which devalues the currency of previous records
*25:58.020- 26:00.500* :  and tarnishes the performances of former record holders,
*26:00.920- 26:03.700* :  such as highly gabris salassi and polar agclif.
*26:04.200- 26:06.580* :  Many are calling for a line to be drawn in the record books
*26:06.580- 26:09.480* :  separating the pre and post-super shoe era.
*26:10.180- 26:13.720* :  But support to say the shoe technology is just one element alongside
*26:13.720- 26:17.620* :  advances in diet, training, refueling and pacemaking.
*26:18.120- 26:21.340* :  A Zeliad Kipchurgi, who ran the world's first sub to our marathon
*26:21.340- 26:24.380* :  in an experiment four years ago, is quick to point out
*26:24.380- 26:26.500* :  it's the athlete who does the running.
*26:27.180- 26:31.920* :  And here's Aiman Martin, the last British male to win the London Marathon in 1993.
*26:32.320- 26:33.500* :  I like the new technology.
*26:33.500- 26:35.040* :  I think it's going to happen.
*26:35.100- 26:37.640* :  You're not going to stay still in this current world we live in.
*26:37.640- 26:40.580* :  So you have to kind of work out a way of embracing it.
*26:40.720- 26:43.440* :  There's no doubt that shoes are getting ever stronger and lighter.
*26:43.500- 26:47.340* :  The sports governing body world athletics says records are always set
*26:47.340- 26:50.020* :  using the best technology and existence at the time.
*26:50.020- 26:52.660* :  As long as the shoes are available to all athletes
*26:52.660- 26:55.740* :  and the souls don't exceed 40 millimeters in thickness,
*26:56.160- 26:57.160* :  they're perfectly legal.
*26:57.820- 26:58.960* :  Love them or love them.
*26:59.280- 27:02.480* :  The super shoe will play a key part in the race to the first ever
*27:02.820- 27:03.760* :  sub to our marathon.
*27:04.220- 27:05.920* :  And it's not just a race between the athletes.
*27:05.920- 27:07.980* :  It's a battle of the brands as well.
*27:08.340- 27:09.320* :  Chris Dennis reporting.
*27:09.780- 27:12.420* :  The world economic forum starts in a week in the Swiss
*27:12.420- 27:13.600* :  resort of Davos.
*27:14.260- 27:16.060* :  It's an occasion when business leaders,
*27:16.060- 27:18.960* :  billionaires and other big names rubbed shoulders
*27:19.560- 27:21.160* :  and talk about putting the world to rights.
*27:21.160- 27:23.920* :  But is anything concrete actually ever achieved?
*27:23.920- 27:27.760* :  Peter Goodman is the global economics correspondent for the New York Times
*27:27.760- 27:30.060* :  and author of a book called Davos Man.
*27:30.560- 27:32.540* :  How the billionaires devoured the world.
*27:33.160- 27:36.900* :  Paul Henley asked him if the book reflected a certain cynicism about the event.
*27:36.900- 27:39.400* :  I think cynicism is the enemy of good journalism.
*27:39.460- 27:42.080* :  But I'd certainly call myself highly dubious
*27:42.580- 27:45.380* :  that the people who are by any reasonable measure
*27:45.380- 27:48.240* :  or the ultimate beneficiaries of the status quo
*27:48.420- 27:51.000* :  are going to go to some mountaintop and the Swiss Alps
*27:51.260- 27:54.440* :  and decide to change the status quo for the betterment of everyone else.
*27:54.860- 27:56.880* :  What I take issue with is this central premise
*27:56.880- 28:00.220* :  that we're all supposed to feel that the people gathered in Davos
*28:00.380- 28:04.720* :  are pursuing social goals that are universally applicable.
*28:04.780- 28:06.940* :  They're going there to do business, they're in make deals.
*28:07.420- 28:08.980* :  And so for journalists it's useful,
*28:08.980- 28:11.240* :  but the whole thing is totally performative
*28:11.300- 28:12.380* :  and increasingly irrelevant.
*28:12.640- 28:16.540* :  So why aren't more people asking what you call the difficult questions
*28:16.660- 28:17.920* :  is the much cow-towing?
*28:18.140- 28:21.780* :  Yeah, access journalism is a problem in much of the world.
*28:21.820- 28:25.820* :  This idea that if I'm kind to the people I'm interacting with,
*28:25.820- 28:27.220* :  I'll get to see them again,
*28:27.780- 28:30.560* :  and that's supposed to ultimately put you in position to learn
*28:30.560- 28:33.500* :  things that no one else would be in a position to learn,
*28:33.900- 28:35.360* :  which generally doesn't happen.
*28:35.560- 28:37.460* :  Once you start playing the access game,
*28:37.460- 28:40.000* :  your journalism is essentially corrupted,
*28:40.000- 28:43.520* :  and you start thinking about your access as an end in and of itself.
*28:43.520- 28:46.720* :  So the social construct of the event
*28:46.720- 28:48.440* :  that convenes in Davos every year
*28:48.800- 28:51.480* :  is all about buying into this notion
*28:51.540- 28:53.400* :  that just by being here
*28:53.760- 28:56.540* :  we're all committed to improving the state of the world.
*28:56.740- 29:00.280* :  And therefore all problems are really just issues of communication.
*29:00.280- 29:02.680* :  We all need to understand one another better
*29:03.140- 29:06.900* :  and then we can figure out how to make drugs and vaccines more affordable.
*29:06.900- 29:10.820* :  We can come up with solutions to the lack of affordable housing around the world.
*29:11.340- 29:12.440* :  Of course that's a fairy tale.
*29:12.580- 29:14.720* :  It's not about communication, it's about power.
*29:14.920- 29:18.800* :  And the state of the world is very much an expression of people who have power
*29:18.800- 29:22.280* :  using that power to undermine our political systems
*29:22.280- 29:26.060* :  in their own interests off into the detriment of everyone else.
*29:26.060- 29:28.940* :  So I reject this idea that we can just
*29:28.940- 29:31.620* :  entrust the billionaire class with figuring out
*29:31.620- 29:33.280* :  how to deal with economic inequality.
*29:33.680- 29:35.500* :  They're the winners of economic inequality
*29:35.500- 29:37.200* :  and they're seeking to perpetuate it.
*29:37.500- 29:39.520* :  So if the billionaires at Davos
*29:39.700- 29:41.540* :  are intent on devouring the world,
*29:41.880- 29:43.380* :  are the world leaders,
*29:43.800- 29:45.400* :  similarly intent on devouring it,
*29:45.400- 29:46.740* :  those that aren't billionaires themselves?
*29:47.060- 29:48.040* :  I mean world leaders,
*29:48.040- 29:51.440* :  depending upon which political system you come from,
*29:51.840- 29:53.420* :  have to deal with the billionaire class.
*29:53.460- 29:56.160* :  I mean oftentimes being successful in business
*29:56.160- 29:57.940* :  and making a fortune is a prerequisite
*29:57.940- 29:59.700* :  for a political success,
*29:59.700- 30:02.260* :  or at least ingratiating yourself with people
*30:02.260- 30:04.720* :  who have the money to fund your dreams.
*30:04.720- 30:07.220* :  So I would argue that what we've seen time
*30:07.220- 30:09.340* :  and again is that the billionaire class has managed
*30:09.340- 30:11.720* :  to persuade the political class
*30:11.720- 30:15.420* :  that what I call the cosmic lie in the book is truth.
*30:15.640- 30:18.660* :  This idea that if we organize our economic systems
*30:19.040- 30:20.860* :  around making it easier for billionaires
*30:20.860- 30:22.140* :  to make their next billion,
*30:22.140- 30:24.540* :  the benefits will just magically trickle down
*30:24.540- 30:25.400* :  to everyone else.
*30:25.780- 30:27.380* :  Something that has happened in reality,
*30:27.700- 30:28.340* :  zero times.
*30:28.500- 30:29.740* :  But we keep trying it
*30:30.060- 30:31.340* :  because the part where the billionaires
*30:31.340- 30:33.920* :  benefit from tax cuts and deregulation,
*30:34.120- 30:35.620* :  that part really works out.
*30:35.980- 30:37.140* :  And they use that cash,
*30:37.140- 30:39.680* :  often in the service of political campaigns.
*30:40.260- 30:41.860* :  And so there's a real nexus between
*30:42.300- 30:44.080* :  the political class and the billionaire class.
*30:44.500- 30:46.820* :  Peter Goodman, Global Economics Correspondent
*30:46.820- 30:47.900* :  for the New York Times.
*30:48.720- 30:50.600* :  The British singer Sophie Ellis Bexta
*30:50.600- 30:52.200* :  is having something of a renaissance
*30:52.680- 30:54.840* :  thanks to the Golden Globe-nominated film,
*30:54.840- 30:57.740* :  Saltburn, directed by Emerald Finale.
*30:57.740- 31:00.080* :  It's the story of an increasingly deborched friendship
*31:00.080- 31:01.860* :  between an Oxford University student
*31:02.200- 31:03.800* :  and his aristocratic classmate.
*31:04.360- 31:06.060* :  And combined with a tick-tock trend,
*31:06.060- 31:08.360* :  it's given a 2001 hit
*31:08.360- 31:11.140* :  and new lease of life as Will Chalk explains.
*31:17.700- 31:18.980* :  If you've seen Saltburn,
*31:18.980- 31:20.500* :  this song will come to images
*31:20.500- 31:22.560* :  of a stark naked Barry Keegan
*31:23.000- 31:25.280* :  dancing through the halls of a mansion house.
*31:26.120- 31:28.760* :  Take care if you're operating heavy machinery right now.
*31:31.080- 31:33.160* :  Thanks to its featuring in the film's climax
*31:33.160- 31:35.080* :  and the subsequent tick-tock trend
*31:35.080- 31:37.100* :  where people mostly fully clothed,
*31:37.340- 31:38.420* :  recreating the scene,
*31:38.420- 31:41.840* :  murder on the dance floor has climbed back into the UK top 10
*31:41.840- 31:43.760* :  for the first time in more than 20 years.
*31:44.280- 31:47.020* :  Sophie Ellis Bexta told the BBC what she makes of it.
*31:47.100- 31:49.080* :  I was approached by Emerald Finale
*31:49.380- 31:50.740* :  quite a few months ago now, actually,
*31:51.000- 31:53.600* :  about using murder on the dance floor in Saltburn.
*31:53.880- 31:56.160* :  And when you're approached for approval of a song,
*31:56.160- 31:58.340* :  you get a little synopsis of how the song will be used.
*31:58.780- 32:01.380* :  So it said that it was going to use the song in its entirety
*32:01.920- 32:05.260* :  while the main character dances in a stately home
*32:05.280- 32:06.400* :  at the end of the film
*32:06.600- 32:08.540* :  and he will be completely naked
*32:09.100- 32:10.100* :  for the entire dance routine.
*32:10.800- 32:12.640* :  And I gave my approval very fast
*32:12.780- 32:14.580* :  because not only was I a fan of Emerald's work,
*32:14.700- 32:16.140* :  I thought, I really have to see that.
*32:16.920- 32:19.040* :  Now, if a viral film or TV show
*32:19.040- 32:23.160* :  bringing a vintage pop hit to a new younger audience sounds familiar,
*32:23.760- 32:24.780* :  that's probably because it is.
*32:31.780- 32:35.320* :  After featuring in the Netflix series Stranger Things in 2022,
*32:36.080- 32:38.780* :  Kate Bush's 1985 hit Running Up That Hill
*32:38.780- 32:41.940* :  was pushed to the top of the UK charts for the first time.
*32:42.300- 32:43.760* :  The singer spoke to the BBC.
*32:43.820- 32:47.060* :  It's so exciting that it's quite shocking, isn't it?
*32:47.060- 32:48.300* :  The whole world's gone mad.
*32:48.660- 32:51.600* :  37 years is the longest time, I believe it's a song
*32:51.600- 32:53.020* :  has taken to get to number one.
*32:53.580- 32:56.540* :  And in America, it's your first ever top 10 hit in the US,
*32:56.540- 32:57.440* :  which I didn't know.
*32:57.900- 33:00.920* :  What's really wonderful, I think, is that this is a whole new audience.
*33:00.980- 33:04.440* :  To a lot of cases, they've never heard of me and I love that.
*33:10.120- 33:12.320* :  Well, back to Saltburn, because as it stands,
*33:12.320- 33:15.220* :  Murder on the Dance floor has never been a UK number one.
*33:15.440- 33:16.620* :  It's currently at number eight.
*33:16.860- 33:19.800* :  But Sophie Ellis Bexter says she's just enjoying the ride.
*33:19.980- 33:23.120* :  What's happened with Murder on Dance floor is absolutely extraordinary,
*33:23.120- 33:24.800* :  but it actually feels really magical.
*33:24.960- 33:27.520* :  And if I'm honest, I don't think I've completely processed it really.
*33:27.900- 33:28.720* :  It's extraordinary.
*33:34.860- 33:38.200* :  Sophie Ellis Bexter, ending that report by Will Chalk.
*33:40.980- 33:42.140* :  And that's all from us for now.
*33:42.140- 33:44.400* :  But the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
*33:44.400- 33:47.640* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph.
*33:47.640- 33:49.160* :  Our editor is Karen Martin.
