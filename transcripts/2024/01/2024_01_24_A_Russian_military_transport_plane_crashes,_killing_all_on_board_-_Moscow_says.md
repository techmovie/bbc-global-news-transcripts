*01:27.380- 01:30.620* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:33.440- 01:36.380* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 1400 GMT on Wednesday,
*01:36.380- 01:39.080* :  the 24th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:39.100- 01:43.280* :  A Russian military transport plane has crashed near the border with Ukraine.
*01:43.280- 01:44.840* :  All on board are dead.
*01:45.480- 01:48.840* :  Donald Trump takes a big step towards another run at the White House,
*01:48.840- 01:51.800* :  but the contest to be the Republican candidate continues.
*01:52.620- 01:55.540* :  And Thailand's opposition leader can take his seat in Parliament
*01:55.960- 01:57.780* :  after being cleared of breaking election law.
*02:00.560- 02:04.360* :  Also to cover this podcast, mass protests are expected in Argentina
*02:04.360- 02:07.200* :  over radical plans to shake up the country's economy.
*02:08.300- 02:12.100* :  Every day we think about whether we're going to be able to pay the rent,
*02:12.960- 02:16.600* :  whether we're going to be able to pay the building service charge, the bills.
*02:21.220- 02:22.500* :  We're going to start though in Russia,
*02:22.500- 02:27.140* :  where as we record this podcast, there are reports that a military transport plane
*02:27.140- 02:30.600* :  carrying dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war has crashed.
*02:31.220- 02:34.540* :  The BBC has seen and has been able to verify footage of a plane
*02:34.540- 02:37.920* :  crashing in a fireball in the southern Bilgarod region.
*02:38.500- 02:41.340* :  There's no independent confirmation, though, of why it came down
*02:41.340- 02:42.860* :  or who was on board.
*02:43.460- 02:46.360* :  A Russia editor Steve Rosenberg gave this update to Sarah Montague.
*02:46.960- 02:49.340* :  Earlier this morning about 11 o'clock local time,
*02:49.840- 02:52.660* :  a Russian military transport plane, an illusion 76,
*02:53.320- 02:55.720* :  crashed in Russia's Bilgarod region.
*02:55.720- 02:59.080* :  Bilgarod is one of those Russian regions that borders Ukraine.
*02:59.960- 03:02.700* :  And very soon after some mobile phone footage emerged,
*03:02.700- 03:07.180* :  shot at a distance showing the aircraft falling from the sky,
*03:07.180- 03:10.500* :  and then this giant fireball rising from the crash site.
*03:10.880- 03:14.600* :  After that, the Russian Defence Ministry said that on board the plane
*03:14.600- 03:20.360* :  was 74 people, including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war,
*03:20.720- 03:25.720* :  who Moscow says, would due to have been part of a prisoner swap later today.
*03:26.960- 03:28.680* :  We cannot independently confirm that.
*03:29.360- 03:32.120* :  But interestingly, later in the Russian Parliament,
*03:32.120- 03:34.020* :  the head of the Russian Parliament's Defence Committee,
*03:34.520- 03:39.040* :  Andr√© Kartepoulov, he made a statement and claimed that there'd been a second plane
*03:39.040- 03:43.900* :  in the sky at the time with another 80 Ukrainian prisoners of war,
*03:44.480- 03:46.340* :  who would you take part in the swap.
*03:46.340- 03:50.200* :  That plane, he said, turned around after the crash.
*03:51.380- 03:53.180* :  Now this is what Moscow is saying.
*03:53.180- 03:56.180* :  The local governor in Bilgarod says there were no survivors
*03:56.520- 03:58.080* :  and that an investigation has begun.
*03:58.960- 04:02.180* :  But Moscow has been making it clear that as far as it's concerned,
*04:02.820- 04:04.640* :  Ukraine shot the plane down.
*04:05.580- 04:10.060* :  The Russian Defence Ministry claims that it observed the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.
*04:10.880- 04:13.380* :  This is all coming from Russian officials I should stress.
*04:13.420- 04:16.820* :  We have no way right now of confirming all of this,
*04:16.820- 04:21.520* :  but certainly the official position of Moscow is this was a terrorist attack.
*04:21.520- 04:24.840* :  The Defence Ministry is calling it by Ukraine.
*04:25.280- 04:27.440* :  And Ukraine, have they said anything about this?
*04:27.960- 04:30.420* :  As far as I know, and I'm sitting in Moscow, of course,
*04:30.420- 04:35.040* :  but Ukrainian officials have said they're trying to clarify the situation.
*04:35.040- 04:37.860* :  We know no more than that as of now.
*04:38.340- 04:40.540* :  Steve Rosenberg, talking to Sarah Montague.
*04:41.440- 04:45.240* :  Now Donald Trump is one big step closer to another run for the White House.
*04:45.240- 04:48.300* :  The former president won the New Hampshire primary overnight.
*04:48.300- 04:51.940* :  The second of the state-by-state contests where voters choose
*04:51.940- 04:54.600* :  who they want to be the Republican Party's candidate
*04:55.020- 04:56.840* :  for the presidential election in November.
*04:57.440- 04:59.560* :  He got around 54% of the votes.
*04:59.740- 05:04.040* :  The only other candidate left in the race, Nikki Haley, got around 43%.
*05:04.560- 05:07.460* :  It's the second of these votes that he's won in a matter of days
*05:07.760- 05:09.540* :  after taking Iowa last week.
*05:10.120- 05:13.880* :  It is unheard of for the contest to be this one-sided so early on,
*05:13.960- 05:15.400* :  but it's not over yet.
*05:15.860- 05:17.220* :  Nikki Haley is fighting on.
*05:17.840- 05:19.580* :  I'll get some analysis of that in a minute.
*05:19.620- 05:23.320* :  But first, let's hear from candidates and the voters in New Hampshire
*05:23.860- 05:26.980* :  that's small state tucked up in America's north-east,
*05:26.980- 05:29.560* :  from where our correspondent Nomiya Igbal reports.
*05:31.340- 05:32.600* :  Well, I want to thank everybody.
*05:32.600- 05:34.840* :  This is a fantastic state.
*05:35.620- 05:38.380* :  It was an election result, Donald Trump, accepted.
*05:38.740- 05:41.800* :  You know, we won New Hampshire three times now, three.
*05:43.840- 05:46.500* :  New Hampshire gave him a big win, but not a blowout.
*05:46.900- 05:49.320* :  Leaving his rival, Nikki Haley, still on for the fight
*05:49.320- 05:52.340* :  to secure the Republican Party's presidential nomination.
*05:52.660- 05:55.340* :  This race is far from over.
*05:55.480- 05:58.280* :  There are dozens of states left to go.
*06:01.420- 06:04.400* :  That was a comment Donald Trump really didn't like.
*06:04.660- 06:09.320* :  Let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night.
*06:10.000- 06:11.120* :  She didn't win. She lost.
*06:12.100- 06:15.160* :  The race to win New Hampshire was seen as a real test for Trump's strength.
*06:18.800- 06:21.700* :  Nearly 40% of people here are independent voters.
*06:22.640- 06:25.020* :  Even before you get inside to the polling station,
*06:25.260- 06:29.180* :  there are about a dozen people outside all waving different signs for Donald Trump,
*06:29.220- 06:31.120* :  Nikki Haley, Joe Biden.
*06:31.780- 06:36.340* :  So they're really letting voters know how they feel as people drive in.
*06:37.540- 06:39.920* :  Amongst the group is Glenn, who arrived early,
*06:39.920- 06:42.740* :  carrying a cartoon picture of Trump wearing a crown
*06:42.740- 06:45.920* :  with the words, live free, not under a king.
*06:46.140- 06:49.020* :  New Hampshire is one of the 13 original colonies.
*06:49.020- 06:51.780* :  My ancestors threw off tyranny.
*06:51.920- 06:53.640* :  King George, the second and the third.
*06:54.080- 06:55.360* :  Excuse me for saying that.
*06:55.500- 06:56.080* :  You're allowed.
*06:58.100- 07:01.880* :  And, you know, we're very sensitive to the constitutional rights and bill of rights.
*07:02.020- 07:04.780* :  And I think that Donald Trump is trash those things.
*07:05.640- 07:09.520* :  But Sue, with her many Trump signs, is no fan of Nikki Haley.
*07:09.520- 07:13.720* :  She thinks she'd be nowhere without Trump, who wants to point at her UN ambassador.
*07:13.720- 07:16.140* :  There is something to be said for loyalty,
*07:16.900- 07:18.780* :  that you don't see Nikki Haley as loyal.
*07:19.200- 07:22.220* :  I don't, and I don't want any more never, Trumpers.
*07:23.060- 07:28.080* :  Give him a shot, give him the second term that he deserved, frankly.
*07:29.180- 07:32.780* :  Sue and Glenn, two very different opinions, two very different votes,
*07:33.360- 07:37.080* :  but still friendly neighbors standing side-by-side in the snow.
*07:37.240- 07:38.500* :  I even made him hot chocolate.
*07:38.880- 07:39.440* :  Yes, she did.
*07:40.160- 07:43.260* :  She brought hot chocolate from me for David and for others.
*07:43.900- 07:44.000* :  Yeah.
*07:44.980- 07:48.600* :  Voters in New Hampshire play an outsized role in deciding presidential nominees.
*07:48.600- 07:51.620* :  That's despite it being one of the smallest states in the country.
*07:52.280- 07:57.340* :  Unlike the Iowa caucus, people have turned up at polling stations at any time during the day to vote.
*07:58.160- 08:01.380* :  Mark is a registered Republican voting for Nikki Haley.
*08:01.460- 08:05.220* :  If Trump were to win, I would be worried for the future of the nation.
*08:05.460- 08:06.400* :  Would you vote for Biden?
*08:06.920- 08:07.340* :  Yes, I would.
*08:07.860- 08:08.760* :  Yep, I would vote for Biden.
*08:09.520- 08:11.340* :  Dan has lived here his whole life.
*08:11.780- 08:14.720* :  I wouldn't say that if New Hampshire goes for Trump,
*08:14.720- 08:16.920* :  that the elections are done deal.
*08:17.380- 08:20.260* :  It's been nearly a decade of the Donald Trump era,
*08:20.800- 08:24.620* :  so his path to the Republican presidential nomination was always likely.
*08:25.380- 08:27.860* :  But to continue all the way to the White House,
*08:27.860- 08:30.320* :  he'll likely face President Joe Biden,
*08:30.880- 08:34.420* :  the man who beat him at the ballot box four years ago.
*08:34.960- 08:35.580* :  Nomiya Igbel.
*08:35.580- 08:37.260* :  So, what does it all mean?
*08:37.380- 08:39.160* :  Is this the start of a very long,
*08:39.180- 08:40.580* :  and this could be very long,
*08:40.580- 08:44.180* :  ten-month election campaign between Trump and Biden?
*08:44.800- 08:46.400* :  Well, our other North America correspondent,
*08:47.100- 08:48.780* :  who's also in New Hampshire,
*08:48.780- 08:50.240* :  spoke to my colleague Justin Webb,
*08:50.760- 08:52.820* :  and he began by assessing how it went for Donald Trump.
*08:53.480- 08:55.600* :  The speech tonight was extraordinary.
*08:55.600- 08:57.960* :  I mean, if you contrast what he said tonight,
*08:57.960- 09:00.600* :  to what he said after the Iowa caucuses last week,
*09:00.600- 09:03.660* :  where it's all about bringing the party together, etc.,
*09:03.660- 09:06.420* :  he was full of venom and, of course,
*09:06.420- 09:07.440* :  it comments tonight,
*09:07.440- 09:09.980* :  swearing on primetime television as well,
*09:11.360- 09:13.020* :  suggesting that he, Haley, was an imposter.
*09:13.020- 09:14.600* :  I mean, he was furious, frankly,
*09:14.600- 09:16.760* :  that she was staying in the race,
*09:16.880- 09:19.980* :  and he paraded some of the people who had dropped out
*09:19.980- 09:22.600* :  and were now supporting him in a rather embarrassing way.
*09:23.120- 09:26.000* :  He doesn't like it one bit that she's fighting on.
*09:26.000- 09:27.120* :  He doesn't understand it.
*09:27.440- 09:29.200* :  And I think it's a strange strategy,
*09:29.200- 09:31.400* :  because not only did he insult her,
*09:31.400- 09:33.380* :  he insulted the kind of moderates,
*09:33.840- 09:36.240* :  undeclared so-called voters in New Hampshire,
*09:36.960- 09:38.740* :  many of whom are Republicans, by the way,
*09:38.740- 09:42.300* :  and many of whom will presumably be voting
*09:42.300- 09:44.120* :  in the general election later this year.
*09:44.120- 09:45.300* :  This is a purple state.
*09:45.300- 09:46.820* :  It's only four electoral votes.
*09:47.420- 09:50.560* :  But if it's tight, it's not worth being rude
*09:50.580- 09:52.220* :  to those people you might need later on.
*09:52.340- 09:54.180* :  And a final brief thought about the general election.
*09:54.180- 09:56.720* :  Joe Biden is also going to be there,
*09:56.720- 09:57.680* :  so he tells us,
*09:58.340- 09:59.940* :  and it is an election, frankly speaking,
*10:00.220- 10:03.500* :  isn't it that most Americans or many Americans just don't want?
*10:04.180- 10:06.580* :  Fast majority don't want me this match up.
*10:07.000- 10:09.660* :  You know, Joe Biden will be 81, Donald Trump will be 78.
*10:10.120- 10:12.220* :  I mean, the most Americans don't want this,
*10:12.220- 10:14.880* :  and most people in both parties don't want.
*10:14.880- 10:16.840* :  This is an extraordinary position.
*10:17.120- 10:19.060* :  And it's going to be a very, very long campaign.
*10:19.060- 10:20.820* :  We know the Democrats are going to focus on
*10:21.200- 10:22.760* :  the threats of democracy and abortion,
*10:22.820- 10:25.100* :  and Donald Trump's going to focus on immigration,
*10:25.280- 10:27.100* :  and they're going to be slugging it out
*10:27.640- 10:29.400* :  in personal terms for the next,
*10:29.440- 10:30.680* :  to where are we, 10 months?
*10:30.960- 10:32.360* :  10 months, get ready for it.
*10:32.380- 10:34.740* :  That was Gary O'Donohue, who was speaking to my colleague,
*10:35.200- 10:35.700* :  Justin Webb.
*10:35.700- 10:37.800* :  And you can hear more about Donald Trump's
*10:38.020- 10:39.120* :  presidential campaign team
*10:39.120- 10:41.920* :  on the latest edition of the Global Story Podcast,
*10:41.920- 10:44.540* :  it's called Meet Trump's New Inner Circle,
*10:45.020- 10:47.060* :  and it's from the BBC World Service.
*10:47.760- 10:48.680* :  All right, let's move on, because
*10:48.680- 10:53.080* :  Gaza's Hamas-Run Health Ministry says more than 200 Palestinians
*10:53.080- 10:55.580* :  have been killed in the past 24 hours
*10:56.020- 10:58.340* :  amid some of the heaviest fighting yet seen
*10:58.760- 11:00.240* :  in the ongoing campaign.
*11:00.300- 11:03.840* :  Israel's military says it's killed numerous squads
*11:03.880- 11:05.100* :  of Palestinian gunmen.
*11:05.460- 11:08.520* :  Fresh evacuation orders have been issued for areas of Han Unis.
*11:08.900- 11:11.080* :  That's the biggest city in the south of Gaza.
*11:11.360- 11:14.120* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem is Yolanda now.
*11:14.280- 11:15.700* :  There's a route out to the south,
*11:15.740- 11:17.740* :  although many people are very frightened to take.
*11:17.740- 11:19.600* :  It's Israeli forces have now issued
*11:19.600- 11:23.400* :  evacuation orders for new parts of Han Unis,
*11:24.060- 11:26.220* :  which the UN says are estimated to house
*11:26.220- 11:27.820* :  about half a million residents
*11:28.040- 11:29.220* :  and displaced people,
*11:29.220- 11:31.520* :  because, of course, in the early stages of the war,
*11:31.860- 11:33.760* :  people living in the north of the Gaza Strip
*11:33.760- 11:37.000* :  were told to relocate to the south for their safety.
*11:37.000- 11:39.480* :  It's also where the two big hospitals,
*11:39.480- 11:42.600* :  Amnossal Hospital and Amal Hospital, are based.
*11:43.320- 11:45.400* :  That's where there are a lot of displaced people
*11:45.400- 11:46.440* :  at Amnossal Hospital.
*11:46.440- 11:49.620* :  That's still really been the main functioning hospital
*11:49.620- 11:51.180* :  in the south of the Gaza Strip.
*11:51.180- 11:52.960* :  So a lot of concern about what this means.
*11:53.380- 11:56.120* :  A lot of criticism, too, from Palestinian leaders
*11:56.120- 11:59.640* :  in the West Bank, from the office of President Abbas.
*12:00.440- 12:02.960* :  He has said that these are dangerous demands by Israel
*12:02.960- 12:05.420* :  for so many people to be told to leave and head south.
*12:05.840- 12:08.160* :  Of course, the concern for Palestinians
*12:08.300- 12:11.560* :  having so many people on the border
*12:11.900- 12:14.360* :  is that there could be a plan to displace them further.
*12:14.800- 12:18.320* :  What Palestinians see is a return of what happened in 1948
*12:18.320- 12:19.860* :  that their Nakhba or catastrophe
*12:19.860- 12:24.600* :  with hundreds of thousands of people displaced by force.
*12:25.000- 12:27.680* :  And, you know, President Abbas has offered said that
*12:28.180- 12:31.080* :  to seem to be Israel's intent to displace Palestinian people.
*12:31.800- 12:33.240* :  So these kind of conversations,
*12:33.240- 12:35.700* :  at the moment, making people that much more panicked
*12:36.100- 12:38.160* :  and, you know, the videos you can see from Khan Yunus
*12:38.420- 12:41.100* :  show heavy gunfire and intense fighting there.
*12:41.880- 12:46.000* :  Can I just talk to you about the beginning of the end, perhaps?
*12:46.100- 12:49.040* :  I mean, I think we're three and a half months into this war now.
*12:49.040- 12:51.920* :  The idea of moving from the north down to the south,
*12:51.920- 12:54.220* :  they're now saying they've encircled Khan Yunus.
*12:54.220- 12:57.700* :  They believe, I think maybe some of the senior Hamas leadership is there.
*12:58.020- 13:01.840* :  I mean, is this the beginning of what could be the end of the military campaign
*13:01.840- 13:03.940* :  or, frankly, are we weeks and weeks
*13:03.940- 13:05.420* :  and your assessment away from that?
*13:05.880- 13:07.840* :  I mean, the lens of the military campaign
*13:07.840- 13:10.260* :  is something that's sort of still disputable.
*13:10.300- 13:15.140* :  But, certainly, what we can say is that there are very serious talks now going on
*13:15.540- 13:18.840* :  through battery and Egyptian mediators with US involvement,
*13:18.840- 13:22.260* :  trying to work towards a new hostage release deal
*13:22.600- 13:24.860* :  that would involve a new ceasefire.
*13:25.180- 13:28.260* :  The BBC has been hearing from a senior Palestinian official
*13:29.200- 13:32.080* :  familiar with these talks that are going on in Egypt at the moment
*13:32.080- 13:34.020* :  where we understand a Hamas delegation
*13:34.060- 13:37.420* :  was given a new proposal to stop the war
*13:37.420- 13:38.700* :  consisting of five stages.
*13:38.700- 13:41.900* :  We're told the main obstacle is Israel's insistence on keeping its forces
*13:41.900- 13:43.640* :  in the Gaza Strip throughout these stages
*13:43.640- 13:45.280* :  and only withdrawing them at the end.
*13:45.280- 13:46.760* :  That's something Hamas has been rejecting.
*13:47.400- 13:49.260* :  Yoland Nell reported from Jerusalem.
*13:50.140- 13:52.620* :  Thailand's laws, which protect the country's monarchy
*13:52.620- 13:56.900* :  from insults and criticism, have been increasingly enforced in the last decade
*13:56.940- 13:59.700* :  since the military took power in a coup.
*14:00.220- 14:03.080* :  The man who wants to change that was today cleared of charges
*14:03.080- 14:06.620* :  of violating election laws by the country's constitutional court.
*14:07.400- 14:10.800* :  Peter Lim Jaronrat will keep his seat just months
*14:10.800- 14:14.280* :  after the Senate prevented his move forward party
*14:14.620- 14:15.580* :  from forming the government.
*14:16.300- 14:19.020* :  I asked our South East Asia correspondence, Jonathan Head,
*14:19.020- 14:22.260* :  if the ruling could mean that Mr. Pitter returns to frontline politics.
*14:23.140- 14:23.960* :  It does for the moment.
*14:24.780- 14:30.460* :  This, what hung on this case, it was about him owning shares in a media company
*14:30.460- 14:32.980* :  which is not allowed under Thai law,
*14:32.980- 14:34.460* :  which were contesting election,
*14:34.540- 14:36.180* :  but this media company had been defunct.
*14:36.180- 14:37.760* :  They were handed down to him by his father
*14:38.200- 14:39.440* :  and a very small block of shares.
*14:39.440- 14:42.980* :  And his argument that that meant he hadn't really violated the law
*14:43.380- 14:45.920* :  was actually accepted by the constitutional court judges.
*14:46.480- 14:47.080* :  It surprises,
*14:47.760- 14:48.740* :  surprised quite a lot of people
*14:48.740- 14:50.560* :  because the constitutional court in Thailand,
*14:50.560- 14:54.220* :  which has the most enormous powers to dissolve parties,
*14:54.220- 14:57.340* :  ban politicians, it's even unseated prime ministers,
*14:57.760- 15:00.820* :  has always ruled against reformist figures in the past.
*15:00.820- 15:02.860* :  It's track record is very strongly that way.
*15:02.860- 15:05.560* :  This time the judges accepted the argument and said,
*15:05.560- 15:09.020* :  well, yes, as this company clearly hadn't functioned for such a long time,
*15:09.020- 15:12.160* :  they didn't consider him to have violated election law.
*15:12.520- 15:14.660* :  So he was suspended six months ago.
*15:14.660- 15:17.280* :  He can now go back, take up a seat in parliament
*15:17.280- 15:19.720* :  and carry on leading his party move forward,
*15:19.720- 15:22.180* :  which is, as you say now, the main opposition,
*15:22.240- 15:23.960* :  as it was not allowed to form a government,
*15:23.960- 15:26.680* :  but his party does face another legal challenge
*15:26.680- 15:28.960* :  in the same court next week.
*15:28.960- 15:31.760* :  And that is a much more serious accusation
*15:32.200- 15:36.320* :  that their proposal to amend the royal defamation law,
*15:36.320- 15:37.920* :  this severe, as majesty law,
*15:37.920- 15:40.100* :  they want it to be much less harsh.
*15:40.520- 15:43.660* :  The criticism of it is that by conservatives
*15:43.660- 15:45.180* :  is that this amounts to an attempt
*15:45.180- 15:48.000* :  to overthrow the entire established political order.
*15:48.320- 15:50.420* :  And if the constitutional court rules that, in fact,
*15:50.420- 15:52.940* :  the party has behaved unconstitutionally
*15:52.940- 15:54.540* :  by proposing changes to that law,
*15:54.940- 15:57.000* :  then the party is very likely to be dissolved,
*15:57.000- 15:59.680* :  and it's possible it's top leadership banned from politics.
*16:00.000- 16:01.960* :  And I'm going to ask you about the Les Mahges Law in a minute,
*16:01.980- 16:04.820* :  but just quickly, do you think this is a significant change
*16:04.820- 16:07.200* :  in sentiment from the constitutional court?
*16:07.960- 16:09.020* :  No, I think it's tactical.
*16:09.020- 16:11.740* :  I mean, it's not clear to us why they ruled the way they did.
*16:11.740- 16:12.800* :  They could have gone either way.
*16:12.800- 16:16.160* :  It's always presumed in Thailand when it's never official
*16:16.580- 16:19.400* :  that the constitutional court is swayed
*16:19.400- 16:23.520* :  by big political powers in Thailand that are outside Parliament.
*16:23.520- 16:25.240* :  We're talking at the very top of the country,
*16:25.620- 16:26.460* :  military monarchy.
*16:26.460- 16:28.700* :  There's a whole nexus up there that's very influential.
*16:29.160- 16:31.080* :  And the court has always ruled in the way
*16:31.080- 16:33.360* :  that the interests of that group in the past,
*16:33.900- 16:35.980* :  what the considerations were in this particular verdict,
*16:35.980- 16:36.560* :  we're not sure.
*16:37.100- 16:42.180* :  But Mr. Pitter's parties' attempts as you say to liberalize,
*16:42.180- 16:45.460* :  maybe, those laws that protect Thailand's royal family.
*16:45.840- 16:48.900* :  I mean, is there a sense that they could have any success
*16:48.900- 16:51.240* :  in that or is that going to be a far, far tougher challenge?
*16:52.020- 16:54.140* :  It'll be interesting to see what the verdict is next week
*16:54.140- 16:55.660* :  because that will send a clear signal.
*16:56.120- 16:58.800* :  I think the signal that was sent, because the same work,
*16:58.800- 17:00.840* :  the same justification was given for blocking him
*17:00.840- 17:01.820* :  from being Prime Minister.
*17:02.120- 17:04.060* :  The Senate said, anyone who wants to change this law,
*17:04.060- 17:06.420* :  you cannot touch the monarchy anywhere at all.
*17:06.720- 17:08.040* :  That means you can't be Prime Minister.
*17:08.280- 17:10.180* :  So that's the prevailing view.
*17:10.480- 17:12.120* :  And I think the official view is,
*17:12.820- 17:14.740* :  there cannot be a discussion about this law.
*17:14.740- 17:15.760* :  It's widely criticized.
*17:15.760- 17:17.600* :  It has horribly harsh sentences.
*17:17.600- 17:19.060* :  For often, quite mild criticisms.
*17:19.680- 17:22.880* :  But right now, they're saying the discussion must be ruled out.
*17:22.900- 17:24.820* :  And I think that will influence the verdict next week.
*17:25.360- 17:26.580* :  Jonathan Head, who's in Bangkok?
*17:29.680- 17:31.780* :  Still to come on this edition of the Global News Podcast.
*17:32.580- 17:35.600* :  It's very useful and important to find where these sites are,
*17:35.600- 17:40.540* :  because as penguins move in response to changing ice conditions,
*17:40.580- 17:43.220* :  they'll probably go to existing colonies.
*17:43.740- 17:45.800* :  So to know where they all are is vital.
*17:46.200- 17:48.060* :  We're going to tell you about new evidence
*17:48.060- 17:50.200* :  that the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica
*17:50.200- 17:53.040* :  are adapting to climate change and melting ice
*17:53.640- 17:54.280* :  by moving home.

*19:08.100- 19:11.260* :  This is the story of a powerful Nigerian televangelist.
*19:11.340- 19:16.520* :  He was a huge celebrity and had a way of presenting himself as man of God.
*19:16.700- 19:19.280* :  He attracted followers to his church from around the globe.
*19:19.540- 19:21.560* :  It was like going to heaven, being asked to stay.
*19:21.660- 19:25.280* :  But once there, some say that TV Joshua used his power
*19:25.500- 19:27.860* :  to control, manipulate, and abuse.
*19:28.740- 19:31.520* :  This is World of Secrets from the BBC World Service.
*19:32.160- 19:33.660* :  Season 2, The Disciple.
*19:34.160- 19:35.220* :  We will thought we were in heaven,
*19:35.640- 19:38.860* :  but we were in hell and in hell terrible things happen.
*19:39.880- 19:43.100* :  Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*19:44.680- 19:46.920* :  Hello and welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:46.920- 19:51.820* :  Now, it's been just a month since President Javier Millet took office in Argentina.
*19:51.900- 19:57.460* :  But large protests are expected soon over his radical plans to shake up the country's economy.
*19:58.060- 19:59.300* :  As we record this podcast,
*19:59.300- 20:04.200* :  tens of thousands of people are likely to take to the streets of Buenos Aires in a general strike.
*20:04.780- 20:08.920* :  Trade union leaders accuse President Millet of breaking the social contract.
*20:09.560- 20:12.480* :  They're against his prescription to tackle crippling inflation,
*20:12.940- 20:16.520* :  part of which has seen energy and transport subsidies slashed.
*20:17.040- 20:19.520* :  People like Oriana say they're finding it hard to survive.
*20:21.500- 20:24.660* :  Every day we think about whether we're going to be able to pay the rent,
*20:25.520- 20:29.140* :  whether we're going to be able to pay the building service charge, the bills.
*20:29.740- 20:33.460* :  To that, we have to add the food bill, transportation costs.
*20:34.160- 20:36.620* :  It's very difficult and you're constantly asking yourself,
*20:36.960- 20:38.260* :  am I going to make ends meet?
*20:38.560- 20:40.960* :  What can I cook back today is not the same as yesterday.
*20:40.960- 20:43.920* :  Since everything is expensive, you're constantly worrying.
*20:44.860- 20:47.660* :  I was Oriana explaining some of the challenges that she faces.
*20:47.780- 20:51.660* :  Well, President Millet wants new laws to slash public spending,
*20:51.660- 20:56.800* :  privatised state enterprises and scrap hundreds of what he says are wasteful regulations.
*20:57.940- 21:02.180* :  Our reporter Vanessa Bushlutter, who's in Buenos Aires, told us more about the plans.
*21:02.800- 21:05.920* :  Just 45 days after Mr. Millet took office,
*21:05.920- 21:09.080* :  it looked like his honeymoon period is already over.
*21:09.080- 21:14.160* :  If there ever was one, the biggest union, the CGT, which has 7 million members,
*21:14.160- 21:15.500* :  has called for this strike.
*21:15.840- 21:19.880* :  And it is expected to be joined by other unions and groups opposed to the president.
*21:19.900- 21:25.480* :  And the unions say that they think they'll be able to mobilise 200,000 people.
*21:26.180- 21:29.460* :  Now, can I ask you the extent to which the Trade Union movement in Argentina
*21:30.620- 21:37.440* :  represents a serious block to have the AMLA's ability to introduce these reforms?
*21:37.720- 21:42.240* :  I mean, can they actually really impede his ability to bring about those changes?
*21:43.600- 21:46.620* :  They can. The Trade Union and Argentina are very well organised.
*21:46.620- 21:49.840* :  So when they call for a general strike like they're doing now,
*21:49.840- 21:53.800* :  they have the possibility of really paralyzing the country.
*21:53.800- 21:58.000* :  It looks like there won't be very many flights flying into Buenos Aires.
*21:58.580- 22:01.900* :  Often the roads are blocked there by impeding transport.
*22:01.980- 22:06.680* :  And they can really challenge the president also on the legal front.
*22:06.740- 22:12.000* :  They already managed to bring or to challenge one of his decrees in court.
*22:12.380- 22:14.080* :  And that decree has now been suspended.
*22:14.420- 22:18.620* :  So they're doing a two-pronged attack there on the streets and also in the courts.
*22:18.980- 22:22.440* :  And just finally, Vanessa, the problems are a long list.
*22:22.480- 22:27.680* :  But what are the most striking problems that Argentina's economy now faces?
*22:29.520- 22:32.300* :  I think the problem that most people face is poverty.
*22:32.300- 22:37.360* :  40% or just over 40% of Argentines are now living in poverty.
*22:37.860- 22:41.000* :  And they're facing huge problems with inflation.
*22:41.000- 22:43.700* :  Inflation is above 200%.
*22:43.740- 22:46.700* :  And it actually rose since Mr Malay came to power.
*22:47.020- 22:49.200* :  And that, of course, affects many, many people.
*22:49.820- 22:50.500* :  Well, that is Argentina.
*22:50.500- 22:55.140* :  Let's go to Germany now where there is also tension in industrial relations.
*22:55.140- 23:00.100* :  Because the government has condemned train drivers who are again going on strike.
*23:00.700- 23:04.100* :  With the country's transport minister calling them destructive and unreasonable.
*23:04.100- 23:09.200* :  Economists have warned the industrial action could cost the country more than a billion dollars.
*23:09.860- 23:10.520* :  Paul Moss explains.
*23:11.140- 23:13.700* :  It really is the last thing the German government needs.
*23:13.700- 23:18.560* :  This month has already seen transport disrupted by angry farmers blocking roads
*23:19.020- 23:22.580* :  and Hawley is joining their protest over fuel tax and regulation.
*23:23.260- 23:28.580* :  Now train drivers have walked out again in what's become the longest industrial dispute on the railways
*23:28.580- 23:30.100* :  that Germany's ever seen.
*23:30.700- 23:34.800* :  Throw in disruption to shipping in the Red Sea because of attacks by the Houthis.
*23:35.300- 23:38.820* :  And Germany's export dependent economy is left looking vulnerable.
*23:39.420- 23:42.640* :  But the train drivers want to pay rise and to work fewer hours.
*23:42.640- 23:45.520* :  And they currently show no sign of giving in.
*23:45.960- 23:51.220* :  The massive explosion in Mongolia's capital caused by a fuel truck colliding with another vehicle
*23:51.660- 23:52.780* :  has killed six people.
*23:53.200- 23:55.040* :  Buildings that were nearby caught fire as well.
*23:55.580- 23:56.900* :  Will Leonardo has the details?
*23:57.500- 24:00.320* :  This nighttime blast in the Mongolian capital, Ulembata,
*24:00.320- 24:05.160* :  appeared to have begun with a smaller fire immediately after the vehicles collided before.
*24:08.700- 24:12.980* :  A nearby resident caught the moment the truck carrying 60 tons of gas exploded,
*24:12.980- 24:15.680* :  causing a huge fireball to rip along the street.
*24:15.680- 24:20.120* :  Three fire fighters trying to put out the original blaze were among the six people killed.
*24:20.120- 24:21.760* :  Several others were injured.
*24:22.240- 24:25.680* :  Mongolian officials said 600 emergency service workers were deployed
*24:25.680- 24:28.360* :  to Dahl's fires taking hold of adjacent buildings.
*24:29.300- 24:31.560* :  We're getting close to the end of the global news podcast now,
*24:31.560- 24:32.820* :  but let's look at this first.
*24:32.820- 24:36.940* :  Scientists believe they may have tracked down the last unidentified
*24:36.940- 24:39.820* :  emperor penguin colonies in the Antarctic.
*24:40.180- 24:43.260* :  The previously unknown nesting sites were spotted by satellite
*24:43.260- 24:45.940* :  and it brings the total number to 66.
*24:46.060- 24:50.320* :  Emperor penguins are considered acutely vulnerable to climate change.
*24:50.900- 24:54.960* :  Dr. Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey explains how they were found.
*24:55.620- 24:59.500* :  In the satellites, we're looking around Antarctica looking at the ice changes
*24:59.820- 25:04.560* :  and how the emperor penguin colonies that we do know are moving in response to climate change
*25:04.560- 25:09.660* :  and whilst we've been doing this, we've spotted these four previously undiscovered colonies.
*25:09.660- 25:14.680* :  It's very useful and important to find where these sites are because as penguins move
*25:14.780- 25:20.600* :  in response to changing ice conditions, they'll probably go to existing colonies.
*25:21.120- 25:24.680* :  So to know where they all are is vital to track their movements.
*25:25.600- 25:29.380* :  So to get a bit more on the threats faced by the penguins, but also how they're adapting.
*25:29.380- 25:31.640* :  Here's our science correspondent Jonathan Amos.
*25:32.000- 25:37.460* :  We have seen in recent years, in particular, very variable ice conditions,
*25:37.560- 25:39.640* :  sea ice conditions in the Antarctic.
*25:40.240- 25:44.280* :  The last couple of years, particularly around summertime,
*25:44.520- 25:50.640* :  towards the end of their breeding season, we've seen record lows in the satellite era.
*25:51.540- 25:55.920* :  And these birds, they nest on the ice for about nine months.
*25:56.580- 26:02.220* :  So they come onto the ice, they caught, they mate, they lay their eggs, they brood,
*26:02.600- 26:05.720* :  they go off and forage for food to bring back to the chicks.
*26:05.720- 26:12.340* :  And they need that sea ice to stay there while the young birds sort of get their sort of slick,
*26:12.340- 26:15.980* :  oily feathers to get ready to go into the water.
*26:16.360- 26:21.840* :  And if that ice breaks up too quickly, then the birds, the young birds will go into the water
*26:21.840- 26:24.460* :  and they'll drown or they'll freeze to death.
*26:24.860- 26:27.760* :  And we've seen that happen a few times in recent years.
*26:28.140- 26:33.280* :  You go back to 2016, thousands of young birds died very close to the British
*26:33.340- 26:37.720* :  Halley base in the eastern wedel sea when the ice broke up underneath them.
*26:38.380- 26:43.540* :  So the penguins know about this, and they adapt, they move.
*26:43.540- 26:47.420* :  They simply find a new place to nest in a new place to live, do they?
*26:47.420- 26:51.160* :  And the scientists are able to see this by satellite imagery from above.
*26:51.980- 26:59.720* :  Yeah, the birds tend to live in distinct groupings, have spacings of about 250 kilometers,
*26:59.720- 27:05.940* :  about 150 miles. And over the years, they've been looking to try and piece together that
*27:05.940- 27:10.540* :  pearl necklace of colonies around the edge of Antarctic.
*27:10.540- 27:17.440* :  And probably with these four, we've got the last of the significant nesting sites in the continent.
*27:17.440- 27:21.880* :  It's unlikely that we will find another very significant colony.
*27:21.880- 27:29.420* :  So this brings the global population to around about 550,000 individual birds.
*27:29.540- 27:33.480* :  And we'll see how they cope in the coming years.
*27:33.480- 27:39.720* :  There is one projection which says this species could be quasi-extinct or extinct to,
*27:40.840- 27:44.360* :  just a few birds or whatever, by the end of the century.
*27:44.640- 27:50.220* :  If, as we expect, the ice around Antarctica to diminish in an ever-warming world.
*27:50.740- 27:55.000* :  Jonathan Amos, now let's end on the Palestinian football team because it's made history,
*27:55.000- 27:59.880* :  winning its first ever game at the Asian Cup. They beat Hong Kong 3-0 on Tuesday,
*28:00.560- 28:04.420* :  and the winning Qatar means they're through to the last 16 knockout round.
*28:04.420- 28:09.800* :  In the midst of the ongoing Israel Hamas war in Gaza, it was an emotional moment for many of the
*28:09.800- 28:13.300* :  players. Here's Yasir Hamid speaking after the game.
*28:13.800- 28:19.920* :  For us, this is amazing. Now the situation, the environment in the dressing room,
*28:19.920- 28:24.960* :  it's amazing because we make history for the national team, for all Palestinian people who
*28:25.100- 28:33.240* :  are suffering. So this is all the team is happy, and I think we made happy also for millions of
*28:33.240- 28:37.120* :  Palestinians around the world. Well, for a bit more on what it felt like and what the game was
*28:37.120- 28:41.380* :  actually like as well, I spoke to journalist Sam Kunti, who was at the match.
*28:41.820- 28:47.760* :  Yeah, it was a very powerful moment here at the Asian Cup when Palestine qualified with the
*28:47.760- 28:54.920* :  Trump win against Hong Kong. And you sense that these Palestinian matches are something else,
*28:55.000- 28:59.760* :  in a sense that they are emotionally draining. You can sense a push on the players,
*28:59.760- 29:06.280* :  you can sense the emotions around the team and the emotions with the fans in the stands.
*29:06.900- 29:12.980* :  And there is of course a high degree of symbolism here because this is a Palestinian entity
*29:13.720- 29:20.960* :  representing Palestinians and the diaspora around the world on all the major stage.
*29:20.960- 29:27.680* :  This is not the West Bank or Gaza, this is a Palestinian team at continental finals.
*29:27.960- 29:31.640* :  What's the quality of the football like there in terms of the game between the Palestinian team
*29:31.640- 29:38.500* :  and Hong Kong? Well, Hong Kong played two other good matches against Iran and the United
*29:39.060- 29:45.600* :  Emirates. Remember, Hong Kong out the lowest ranked team in the tournament. It felt yesterday that day
*29:46.060- 29:51.540* :  had kind of run out of energy and steam and they couldn't apply the same intensity.
*29:51.540- 29:57.600* :  I'm just reading that Palestine's captain Musa Bal Batat reckons that this demonstrates his team
*29:57.600- 30:01.700* :  is among the best in the continent. Do you think that's true? Well, perhaps that is an
*30:01.700- 30:08.300* :  overstatement. I mean, the sense that, you know, Palestine obviously can compete with the major
*30:08.300- 30:14.940* :  traditional continental heavyweights. But there is a sense that the team has grown four years ago.
*30:14.940- 30:19.740* :  They didn't make it out of the coach stages and they played very defensive football.
*30:19.740- 30:25.480* :  They're playing more expensive football. And just quickly, I mean, so what hopes now for the
*30:25.480- 30:31.400* :  last 16 are they going to progress? Or frankly, just to get this far is enough? Yeah, I think
*30:31.400- 30:36.660* :  you could sense among the players that there was a sense of relief. They're no longer on the
*30:36.720- 30:42.340* :  pressure they have delivered and this tournament is all heard. Yes, success. They're likely to play
*30:42.340- 30:51.300* :  Australia or Qatar in the round of 16. And that might perhaps be a step too far. But it's a
*30:51.300- 30:56.680* :  miracle that they've gotten this far. It's a major achievement. So from their point of view,
*30:57.140- 31:03.240* :  the tournament has already been a success. Sam Kunti, who watched that game at the Asian Cup in Qatar?
*31:06.300- 31:09.580* :  Right, that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
