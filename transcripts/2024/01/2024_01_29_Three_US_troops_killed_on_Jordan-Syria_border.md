*01:24.920- 01:29.520* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Monday the 29th of January.
*01:29.520- 01:33.760* :  Three American troops are killed in an attack on the Jordanian Syrian border.
*01:33.760- 01:39.580* :  The first such death since the Gaza conflict began. The US claims Iranian-backed militants.
*01:39.800- 01:44.180* :  The three American service members we lost were patriots in the highest sense.
*01:44.560- 01:49.700* :  We will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing.
*01:49.700- 01:55.660* :  We'll this lead to a further escalation. There are hopes that a new deal between Israel and Hamas
*01:55.660- 02:01.660* :  is moving closer after talks in Paris, and a blow for African unity as Bikina Faso Marley and
*02:01.660- 02:10.040* :  Niger quit Ekoos. Also in the podcast, Finland's first presidential poll since it joined NATO is
*02:10.040- 02:21.720* :  going to a second round. And we speak to the lead character of the hit Netflix
*02:21.720- 02:32.420* :  narco series, Griselda. As Israel's most important ally, the US is already a major player in the
*02:32.420- 02:36.940* :  current conflict in the Middle East, sending ships to the region and carrying out strikes on
*02:36.940- 02:42.440* :  targets in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. But now the American military has suffered its first deaths
*02:42.440- 02:48.180* :  from enemy fire since the Gaza war began. In a written statement, the US President Joe Biden
*02:48.180- 02:53.720* :  said three service personnel have been killed in an overnight drone attack on a small US outpost
*02:53.720- 02:58.600* :  in the Jordanian Syrian border, and he blamed Iranian-backed militants.
*02:59.080- 03:04.320* :  Today, America's heart is heavy. Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen
*03:04.320- 03:09.920* :  and Americans across the country, engraving the loss of these warriors in this despicable
*03:10.440- 03:16.580* :  and wholly unjust attack. The three American service members we lost were patriots in the highest
*03:16.580- 03:22.860* :  sense. We will carry on their commitment to fight terrorism and have no doubt. We will hold all
*03:22.860- 03:29.320* :  those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing. The words of Joe Biden,
*03:29.320- 03:32.960* :  I heard more about the attack from our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams.
*03:33.480- 03:39.100* :  So this was a place called Tower 22. It's one of a cluster of American bases on the Syrian
*03:39.100- 03:45.040* :  Jordanian border, close to the quite sizeable American base of a tamp, which is on the Syrian side
*03:45.040- 03:50.360* :  and which is a base that's been there since around 2016. These are bases where the US
*03:50.360- 03:56.400* :  conducts counterterrorism, counter narcotics operations and do some training of Syrian opposition as well.
*03:56.460- 04:02.900* :  It's an area where rebel groups, whether they are Iraqi or Syrian, have launched attacks at in
*04:02.900- 04:07.520* :  the past. A tampa I think was hit back in October. But I think what is significant about this is
*04:07.520- 04:14.380* :  that even though we have seen upwards of 150 attacks on American bases across Iraq and Syria and
*04:14.380- 04:19.560* :  elsewhere in recent months, this is the first time any of those drone attacks have resulted in
*04:19.560- 04:23.700* :  American fatalities. And that obviously puts the Americans in quite an interesting bind.
*04:23.700- 04:30.220* :  They're blaming Iranian back groups operating in Syria and Iraq and they say they will respond
*04:30.340- 04:35.720* :  could this lead to a serious escalation in the region. It could, but the Americans have been
*04:35.720- 04:40.720* :  dealing with these attacks for several months now and this isn't just because of the war in
*04:40.720- 04:46.860* :  Gaza. This is obviously a much longer story of opposition to American presence in Syria and Iraq.
*04:46.860- 04:50.980* :  Those attacks have definitely escalated in recent months and the Americans have launched a
*04:50.980- 04:56.700* :  number of attacks as a result. And obviously this pits the Americans against ultimately Iran,
*04:56.700- 05:01.480* :  which is the power that is backing these militant groups in Iraq and Syria. And so there is a
*05:01.480- 05:06.340* :  danger there that two of the major powers could be sucked into something more significant. I think
*05:06.340- 05:12.160* :  both sides are very keen to avoid that. There is frankly nothing in it for either the Americans
*05:12.160- 05:17.480* :  or the Iranians to trigger a wider escalation. As we've seen, the Americans have been very keen
*05:17.480- 05:22.920* :  since October to try and damp down the various regional tensions that have been spreading here
*05:22.920- 05:27.500* :  there and everywhere. This makes all of that more difficult. You've got the ongoing business
*05:27.500- 05:32.080* :  with the Houthis in the Red Sea, another major headache for the Americans. But I think we will see
*05:32.080- 05:35.920* :  the Americans doing what they have done before, which is to go after those they regard as responsible
*05:35.920- 05:41.900* :  for these attacks, but try really hard not to escalate. Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams,
*05:41.900- 05:47.560* :  while despite the threat of a possible escalation in the area, there are signs that a pause in the
*05:47.560- 05:53.500* :  fighting in Gaza itself could be getting closer. Talks over a new truce in exchange for a release
*05:53.500- 05:58.800* :  of more Israeli hostages have been held in the French capital Paris, reportedly attended by
*05:58.800- 06:04.220* :  intelligence cheese from the US, Israel and Egypt. Israel said the discussions were constructive,
*06:04.220- 06:10.140* :  but gaps remain. So what can we say about the talk so far? I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem
*06:10.700- 06:17.820* :  We know that an Israeli delegation got to Paris on Sunday morning. We understand from other
*06:17.820- 06:23.940* :  reports from the US that a US delegation will involve the head of the CIA, Bill Burns. We think
*06:23.940- 06:28.780* :  that the Israeli delegation includes the head of Mossad, the Israeli spy agency. We think that his
*06:28.960- 06:33.660* :  Egyptian counterpart is there and top officials from Qatar, but being a sort of a meeting of spies,
*06:33.660- 06:38.360* :  as you'd expect, there's not very much publicly disclosed. We don't even know exactly where it's
*06:38.360- 06:42.420* :  happening. Representatives of Hamas will be there, although the Israelis and Hamas don't speak
*06:42.420- 06:48.760* :  directly. And what we understand is that the Israelis are mooting an idea of a two-month ceasefire,
*06:49.360- 06:53.700* :  which there would be a phased release of all remaining Israeli hostages and those who have been
*06:53.700- 06:59.220* :  killed. In exchange for them, Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. Hamas has in
*06:59.220- 07:04.440* :  the past said that any hostage release deal needs to involve a permanent ceasefire, so there is
*07:04.440- 07:09.340* :  still a gulf between them. And of course a blood stoke to gulf. And we wait to see whether the
*07:09.340- 07:13.780* :  regional mediates, particularly the Qatar Egyptians, can bridge that gulf. So obviously there are
*07:13.780- 07:19.680* :  differences. Are there ways that they can be bridged? One of the ways that it can be bridged is
*07:20.400- 07:25.960* :  just the sort of growing narrative in this war at which the Israeli government clearly is very
*07:25.960- 07:32.480* :  aware of. The pressure that is being exerted by Israel's western allies, the pressure that is
*07:32.480- 07:37.280* :  being exerted by the families of the hostages, to make significant progress on releasing these hostages.
*07:37.280- 07:43.860* :  Today marks three months since the ground offensive began. And Israel has not really yet achieved
*07:43.860- 07:49.980* :  its military aims. I mean, it says it has destroyed 9,000 combatants in Gaza. We have no way
*07:49.980- 07:55.480* :  of knowing that. US intelligence is reported to have concluded that Israel's military achievements
*07:55.480- 08:02.460* :  fall well short of that. And yet still 130 or so hostages have not returned. Is Rubley for about
*08:02.460- 08:09.140* :  28 of them might already be dead. That really deep wound the missing hostages is something that
*08:09.420- 08:15.060* :  is motivating gradually the Israelis to reengage in some kind of talks realizing that perhaps
*08:15.060- 08:19.920* :  that twin aim of total destruction of Hamas and getting the hostages back may not actually
*08:20.380- 08:25.500* :  achieve a pull. Mark Lohan in Jerusalem. Demonstrations against the far right have continued
*08:25.500- 08:31.080* :  across Germany this weekend and even spread to Austria. The protest was sparked by revelations
*08:31.080- 08:36.580* :  that far-right activists had attended a meeting which reportedly discussed the mass deportation
*08:36.580- 08:41.660* :  of migrants and German citizens of foreign origins. The scandal has damaged the far-right
*08:41.660- 08:47.020* :  alternative for Deutschland party which had been polling strongly in Germany. Upper Linko
*08:47.020- 08:52.100* :  Respondent Jessica Parker reports now from the city of Chemnitz in the state of Saxony.
*08:56.320- 09:03.240* :  A crowd gathers in Chemnitz city square. With help Renata Harris slowly climbed stairs to the stage.
*09:03.240- 09:08.960* :  In her 80s she survived the Holocaust. Many of her Jewish family did not.
*09:11.080- 09:16.740* :  It's very important that we Jews raise our voice. The situation in Germany has become
*09:16.740- 09:22.980* :  threatening because of alternative for Deutschland and other far-right groups, not just for us Jews.
*09:26.080- 09:31.720* :  These demos were sparked by a report from the investigative outlet Corrective. It revealed that
*09:31.720- 09:37.080* :  senior figures from the alternative for Deutschland party met with right-wing extremists where the
*09:37.080- 09:44.960* :  mass deportation of asylum seekers and so-called non-Germans was allegedly discussed. Also at the protest
*09:44.960- 09:50.300* :  is the city's mayor, Sven Schultzer, a member of the German Chancellor's Social Democrats.
*10:06.800- 10:09.580* :  The next day the same square is now home to a market.
*10:11.800- 10:17.340* :  Yarnas selling plenty of honey but says she's unhappy about the cost of living and cash being sent
*10:17.340- 10:24.760* :  to Ukraine. The AFD's been polling at over 30% here in Saxony and she's planning to vote for them.
*10:26.380- 10:32.020* :  They never had a chance to be in power because no one wants to work with them. Maybe if they got
*10:32.020- 10:37.880* :  into power it would be good for us. There's been a lot of controversy around the AFD recently. Has
*10:37.880- 10:47.380* :  that put you off at all? In my view, no. The AFD says it's being smeared. But the party in Saxony
*10:47.380- 10:54.240* :  has been designated as extremist in the halls of Chemnitz City Council. I meet Falker Dringenberg,
*10:54.240- 10:59.500* :  the party's Greek leader here. We believe that many of these demonstrators don't know our program.
*11:00.300- 11:04.820* :  We're in the absurd situation where people demonstrate with the government against the
*11:04.820- 11:12.980* :  opposition that's unheard of. I'm in the centre of Chemnitz and stood by an enormous 40-foot
*11:12.980- 11:19.960* :  tall monument of Karl Marx's head. It is an unsupported reminder we're in that part of Germany
*11:19.960- 11:26.760* :  that was separated off from the West for decades and still to this day some people carry a sense of
*11:26.760- 11:33.340* :  being different somehow or looked down upon and it's seen as a driver of the AFD's popularity here.
*11:33.960- 11:37.760* :  The level of support will be tested in key elections later this year.
*11:38.580- 11:44.840* :  Jessica Parker in Germany. Police in Turkey have arrested two suspects after a man was killed
*11:44.840- 11:49.880* :  during Sunday Mass at a Catholic church in Istanbul. The motive for the shooting wasn't immediately
*11:49.880- 11:55.600* :  clear. Officials though said it looked like a targeted assassination. The church is located
*11:55.600- 12:00.700* :  about 20 kilometres north of the city's main tourist sites. I heard more from our correspondent
*12:00.700- 12:07.180* :  in Istanbul, Alla Garen. Well this was a very chilling attack and it was captured on CCTV. First
*12:07.180- 12:14.020* :  of all you see two masked gunmen who are walking strolling actually towards the church very calmly.
*12:14.020- 12:18.960* :  Then you see footage from inside the church. The congregation are already on their feet,
*12:18.960- 12:24.260* :  masses underway. People are facing towards the altar. At the back of the church you see one man
*12:24.260- 12:30.700* :  come in and he is followed almost immediately by the two attackers who appear to target him directly.
*12:30.700- 12:35.520* :  At this stage bullets are ringing out in the church. Members of the congregation are ducking
*12:35.520- 12:42.380* :  for cover and the interior ministry is saying that the two suspects in the case have now been arrested.
*12:42.380- 12:47.980* :  There's been a statement from the interior minister congratulating the police who he described as
*12:47.980- 12:54.020* :  heroic and expressing sympathy to the family of the victim. There has also been a claim reported
*12:54.020- 13:01.440* :  on the media from IS claiming that they carried out the attack now at this stage that is unverified.
*13:01.440- 13:06.980* :  But at the end of last year the authorities here arrested about 30 people who they
*13:06.980- 13:12.560* :  claimed were associated with IS and they said that they had been carrying out reconnaissance
*13:12.560- 13:19.000* :  with the aim of attacking places of worship of Christians and Jews in Istanbul but so far
*13:19.080- 13:24.460* :  we have no confirmation that this was IS or that these two suspects were in any way linked with
*13:24.460- 13:29.240* :  that group who were arrested at the end of last year. Turkey has a history of violent attacks
*13:29.240- 13:34.500* :  including large scale attacks that have been carried out by Islamic State and there is also a
*13:34.500- 13:40.680* :  history here of attacks on the Christian minority from time to time. Now at the scene today
*13:40.680- 13:46.120* :  local officials were keen to stress to us that in the neighborhood there were good relations
*13:46.120- 13:51.400* :  between people of different faiths and they said there was no tension and they even said that
*13:51.560- 13:56.680* :  Muslims in the area had visited the church as well as Christians. It is certainly the case that
*13:56.680- 14:02.440* :  Christians in Turkey have been targeted in the past. Pope John Paul today rushed to offer his
*14:02.440- 14:08.480* :  sympathies to the community saying that he felt very close to the congregation. Allegarin in Istanbul.
*14:08.540- 14:13.420* :  The infamous Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar apparently once said,
*14:13.420- 14:20.620* :  the only man I was ever afraid of was a woman named Griselda Blanco. Blanco known as the cocaine
*14:20.620- 14:27.020* :  godmother ran a huge drug ring in Miami in the 70s and 80s importing narcotics from her native
*14:27.020- 14:32.860* :  Colombia. Now the story of this female drug lord in a male dominated world is being told in a
*14:32.860- 14:38.480* :  TV series on Netflix. Blanco is portrayed by fellow Colombian actress Sophia Vagara.
*14:39.220- 14:45.580* :  For the last three years Griselda Blanco has owned Miami. Distributing cocaine.
*14:46.640- 14:51.820* :  I grew up in Colombia during the narcotrophic era. We all knew the drug dealer's names and you know
*14:51.820- 14:57.540* :  Pablo Escobar they were joys. I knew who they were, how they even looked and I had never heard of
*14:57.540- 15:03.240* :  this woman. So when I was in the United States already leaving and I first heard of her I was like
*15:03.420- 15:07.160* :  there was a Colombian woman you know that was able to get to that level.
*15:16.500- 15:21.160* :  I think because she was a woman she was able to get away with a lot because nobody was expecting
*15:21.200- 15:28.360* :  that a woman was part of this crazy only man dominated business. I know what I'm doing.
*15:29.400- 15:33.580* :  I thought it was the perfect character for me because I'm Colombian, I'm a mother,
*15:33.580- 15:38.800* :  I'm an immigrant and I lived through the narcotrophic era so I'm like I know what this person is.
*15:39.100- 15:46.820* :  I moved cocaine for 10 years, made into New York and you have no idea what I have gone through since.
*15:47.600- 15:54.040* :  It was important for all of us to make Griselda not just like one sided complete monster from the
*15:54.040- 16:00.000* :  beginning but to make people relate to her understand what she was coming from.
*16:00.420- 16:04.940* :  What's up? I can't even see how the house nothing's going. Find a place? Not yet.
*16:04.940- 16:11.980* :  The most crazy thing for me was that he was a mother that cared about her friends and she wanted
*16:11.980- 16:18.200* :  to help them but that she could have that other side. I wanted her business once to arrive without
*16:18.620- 16:23.000* :  this money. You're going to get caught Griselda or worse and I don't want to be around to see it.
*16:23.200- 16:29.660* :  Or what happens to your kids? What we really wanted to capture more was how she turned into this.
*16:29.660- 16:37.360* :  This was like a small delicate kind of girl when she started. A woman that had a lot of trauma
*16:37.360- 16:43.680* :  and abuse when she was young, it was a woman that went through so much.
*16:47.660- 16:53.680* :  One of the most important things to do Griselda was that I wanted to do it in Spanish and in English
*16:53.680- 17:01.340* :  so we're in the Latin American Actors. Sometimes we don't get opportunities to be in productions of
*17:01.340- 17:08.640* :  this size with Netflix and for me to be able as a producer to open doors for these actors,
*17:08.640- 17:15.240* :  most of them they would love to have managers and agents in Hollywood. I hope this is going to
*17:15.240- 17:19.420* :  change their lives and their career the same way the modern family change way.
*17:19.440- 17:23.540* :  I don't want that I have been through. I'm not going to give it away or nothing.
*17:25.400- 17:30.080* :  Actress Sophia Vagara on playing the lead role in the new Netflix series Griselda.
*17:32.700- 17:34.500* :  Still to come on the global news podcast?
*17:34.500- 17:43.120* :  Def Jam is the motel of rap. It's the primary significant label that foreshadows all that came after.
*17:43.920- 17:46.140* :  Forty years since the hip-hop revolution.
*17:53.660- 17:57.640* :  When the economic community of West African states was set up in 1975,
*17:57.660- 18:04.560* :  Bikina Faso, Mali and Niger were all founding members. But after a series of coups in recent years,
*18:04.560- 18:09.660* :  they've all been suspended from the trading block with Mali and Niger also facing heavy sanctions.
*18:10.280- 18:14.000* :  Now the three nations have said they are pulling out of echo was for good.
*18:14.000- 18:18.080* :  I heard why from my African regional editor Andrew Occiang.
*18:18.280- 18:23.980* :  They're saying it's been taken up by foreign ideologies. It's not been helping them fight the
*18:23.980- 18:27.220* :  jihadists. It's not been helping them with the security situations. And then there's
*18:27.220- 18:30.720* :  the problem of the sanctions they're complaining about because since the coups'
*18:30.940- 18:35.620* :  echoes as imposed sanctions on the three countries, saying that they have to restore civilian
*18:35.980- 18:40.940* :  their assets in the echo as central bank have been frozen. They can't borrow money from the
*18:40.940- 18:45.640* :  regional body. Some regional banks which operate in Niger have suspended their activities there.
*18:45.640- 18:51.880* :  Nigeria cut power to Niger. So some of these things are affecting individuals in these countries
*18:52.280- 18:56.260* :  just after the coup and these sanctions were imposed. We were reporting issues about lack of food,
*18:56.640- 19:01.640* :  lack of power. And people can't get enough money out of the banks because of these sanctions.
*19:01.640- 19:06.460* :  So they're affecting people on the ground and then there's the issue of insecurity they're saying
*19:06.780- 19:11.580* :  echo is not helping them fight Islamist jihadists in their countries. Yeah, echo was quite an
*19:11.580- 19:17.340* :  important trading block. What would be the long-term impact of the departure of these three countries
*19:17.340- 19:22.140* :  if they do go through with it? Echo was saying first of all that they haven't received any formal
*19:22.140- 19:26.520* :  notification of this departure. So we don't know the technicalities of how they're going to leave
*19:26.520- 19:30.760* :  and what is going to happen after they leave. Remember there are also other countries which are
*19:30.760- 19:35.120* :  involved in this and which been sort of trying to get back to echo us. You remember these
*19:35.300- 19:39.100* :  three countries have also been suspended from the EU because of the African Union. Yes, the African
*19:39.100- 19:44.440* :  Union that is like Guinea for example. So some of these countries have not said what they want to do
*19:44.780- 19:48.600* :  but it's affecting the credibility of echo was. Remember when the coup happened,
*19:48.600- 19:54.280* :  echoers had been giving ultimate terms of saying within 48 hours if you don't restore civilian
*19:54.280- 19:58.500* :  rule, if you don't release the president, Mohammed Basoum were going to come in with military
*19:58.500- 20:03.460* :  and do all these things and they never did anything. If echo was's threat so far haven't had any
*20:03.460- 20:09.000* :  impact on changing the attitudes of these coup leaders, is there anything they can do to try to
*20:09.360- 20:13.580* :  bring them back to come around the table again? It doesn't seem anything so far other than accept
*20:13.580- 20:18.860* :  the coups but now there's the danger of if you start accepting coups then analysts are calling
*20:18.860- 20:23.820* :  it the coup belt. It might start affecting other countries in the entire part of Africa. So there
*20:23.820- 20:29.100* :  are sentiments within those countries that made an excuse for these coups took place in the
*20:29.100- 20:35.040* :  fast place and now if echoers doesn't seem to be listening to these issues it could be problematic
*20:35.040- 20:41.620* :  as well. Africa, regional editor Andrew Ochen. France has become the 10th nation to suspend payments
*20:41.620- 20:47.580* :  to the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrah. After Israel said several members of the
*20:47.580- 20:53.240* :  agency staff were involved in the deadly Hamas attacks of the 7th of October. The UN chief has
*20:53.240- 20:58.620* :  appealed for funding to continue. After major donors like the US Britain and Germany pulled their
*20:58.620- 21:04.920* :  financial support. Other big donors like Norway will continue to send money. As the Norwegian
*21:04.920- 21:11.980* :  foreign minister, Espenbart Ada, explained to Tim Franks. We are as appalled and shocked by these
*21:12.060- 21:18.040* :  very serious allegations about local staff when we're having possibly taking part in terrorist
*21:18.040- 21:22.960* :  attacks that is 100% unacceptable and we need the full investigation of that. However,
*21:22.960- 21:29.200* :  to react to that by cutting all funding to Unrah, which is providing life saving support to
*21:29.200- 21:35.400* :  millions of people in the most dire conditions of their life, I think is a very wrong response.
*21:35.400- 21:40.120* :  So I agree with the Secretary General that we should not do that, we should keep the funding
*21:40.120- 21:45.280* :  and we should also port a leadership to get to the bottom of this case. I guess the problem is
*21:45.280- 21:50.360* :  though for donor countries and it's the case that's been made by many inside Israel for some time
*21:50.360- 21:56.800* :  is that it's extremely difficult in a place like Gaza under which Hamas has exerted such a grip
*21:56.800- 22:03.880* :  over many years. To be certain that money that is going in for humanitarian relief is actually
*22:03.880- 22:08.760* :  being spent on the civilians who need it rather than the militants who might take it.
*22:08.880- 22:13.440* :  That critique has been there for a long time and it should be taken seriously but remember that
*22:13.440- 22:19.580* :  these concrete allegations are not about money transfers. They are about local employees who
*22:19.580- 22:25.560* :  have taken part in the terrorist attacks on 7th of October, totally unrelated to their work in Unrah.
*22:25.560- 22:30.700* :  That is unacceptable but it's not a question of diversion of funds. It's about what they did
*22:30.700- 22:35.380* :  outside of their job. These people have been dismissed immediately as investigations are going on
*22:35.380- 22:41.800* :  as they should. There are 30,000 employees in Unrah altogether. It's the biggest vehicle of
*22:41.800- 22:48.140* :  life saving support to millions of people including in Gaza and the vast majority of these people are
*22:48.140- 22:53.560* :  at the risk of their life delivering incredibly important support for people in the very difficult
*22:53.560- 22:59.060* :  circumstances. 140 plus of these people have been killed in airstrikes or in fighting over
*22:59.060- 23:04.040* :  since the 7th of October. The vast majority have nothing to do with this violence but to have
*23:04.040- 23:09.400* :  an absolute zero risk situation is very difficult when these people are so embedded into society
*23:09.400- 23:14.660* :  which is why Unrah and the UN now needs to identify why the these allegations are true which
*23:14.660- 23:20.060* :  I might be and to prevent that this happens again. My point is that donors were drawing support
*23:20.060- 23:25.940* :  from Unrah in this extremely critical situation where people are dying in the hundreds every day
*23:25.940- 23:31.140* :  is not the right response. These people are not refugees because they wanted to be refugees.
*23:31.200- 23:35.440* :  They are refugees because the world community has not been able to solve the Palestinian question.
*23:35.920- 23:39.980* :  The Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Bart Ada talking to Tim Franks.
*23:40.440- 23:45.480* :  Well, Aynat Willf is a former member of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, and a long-term
*23:45.480- 23:51.080* :  critic of Unrah. What does she make of the UN Secretary General saying he's horrified by allegations
*23:51.080- 23:56.540* :  of Unrah's staff being involved in the attacks of the 7th of October? But at the same time calling
*23:56.540- 24:02.320* :  for funding to continue because it is so badly needed. He should be horrified by the continued
*24:02.320- 24:08.860* :  existence of Unrah. It's still temporary agency after more than seven decades that has been
*24:08.860- 24:16.120* :  hijacked by the Arab refugees themselves, now Kassist Palestinians, for the singular purpose
*24:16.120- 24:23.440* :  of keeping the war of 1948 as an open case until they win it to their cause of no Jewish state.
*24:23.560- 24:30.060* :  That is the deep purpose of Unrah. Everything else it does is marginal to this purpose.
*24:30.340- 24:36.520* :  I know it's not a statement that is that unusual in some quarters, particularly in Israel. But
*24:36.520- 24:43.660* :  this UN agency provides critical aid for Palestinians even when there isn't a war.
*24:43.660- 24:50.220* :  I mean, right now they are literally a lifeline for around two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
*24:50.580- 24:56.580* :  It's actually a complete reversal of cause and effect. First of all, it's important to know that
*24:56.580- 25:02.200* :  thanks to Unrah Palestinians are some of the most educated and enjoying some of the best healthcare
*25:02.200- 25:08.700* :  and education in the Arab world. But the reversal of cause and effect is that the agency has been
*25:08.700- 25:15.000* :  hijacked for the purpose of keeping the Arab refugees and perpetual refugee hood because they
*25:15.000- 25:20.080* :  understood that if they would be settled, they would essentially be accepting that the Jewish
*25:20.080- 25:27.100* :  state remains and to them that was unacceptable. So everything that Unrah does is in the service
*25:27.100- 25:32.920* :  of keeping the war of 1948 open. You could provide those services in a variety of ways.
*25:33.220- 25:39.860* :  Not least of which, the Palestinians could actually finally be told that they need to be responsible
*25:39.860- 25:45.780* :  for themselves rather than being kept as a people constantly waiting for the Jewish state
*25:46.160- 25:51.420* :  not to exist and fighting to bring it about. Essentially, you're saying that these people are
*25:51.420- 25:56.980* :  refugees because it is in their interest to be refugees. They would argue that the reason that
*25:56.980- 26:01.780* :  they are refugees is because there is no resolution to the conflict. But it's reversal of cause
*26:01.780- 26:07.560* :  and effect. No, and I understand it is a valid aim at it. I could just ask a quick question right now
*26:07.560- 26:13.360* :  in the middle of a war when you have got people who are utterly desperate. Most of them are surviving
*26:13.360- 26:22.880* :  on barely any food for several countries to suspend funding of the major agency with the
*26:22.880- 26:30.300* :  prospect that funding could run out within days. That is a humanitarian emergency which surely
*26:30.300- 26:36.760* :  supersedes everything else. Again, we have arrived at the current moment because Unrah for decades
*26:36.760- 26:45.080* :  has kept Palestinians in a suspended limbo to be a people fighting for one thing only to destroy
*26:45.080- 26:51.120* :  the Jewish state. The moment that they understand that they can live next to the Jewish state rather
*26:51.120- 26:56.700* :  than instead of it, that they are not into the fifth generation refugees from Palestine, but
*26:56.700- 27:02.920* :  rather already living in Palestine, that they can build for themselves. Then they should get all
*27:02.920- 27:08.160* :  the money in the world. I think all the donor countries should give Palestinians 10 times what
*27:08.160- 27:13.200* :  they're giving them. But first they need to hear from Palestinians that they have finished their
*27:13.200- 27:20.320* :  century long war and then Gaza can prosper. Ain't that, willf, talking to Tim Fracks. Finland's
*27:20.320- 27:25.440* :  presidential election will go to a runoff. With almost all votes counted, the candidate of the
*27:25.440- 27:31.040* :  main governing national coalition party, Alexander Stubbe, is leading. The centre-right politician has
*27:31.040- 27:36.220* :  won more than a quarter of the vote so far. Well under the 50% needed for outright victory,
*27:36.640- 27:40.800* :  then the Aeberhardt has more details. This was an election in which the nine candidates
*27:40.800- 27:45.980* :  broadly agreed on the main issue. They all promised to take a tough stance against Moscow,
*27:46.520- 27:52.060* :  amid security concerns unleashed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Following the first
*27:52.060- 27:57.700* :  round vote, Alexander Stubbe, a former prime minister, will face off against Becker Harvestor,
*27:57.700- 28:03.840* :  a green politician standing as an independent, in two weeks' time. As the country's former foreign
*28:03.840- 28:09.680* :  minister, Mr Harvestor helped steer Finland through to NATO membership last year. Finland and
*28:09.680- 28:14.780* :  Russia share a long border, and Helsinki blamed Moscow for orchestrating an influx of irregular
*28:14.780- 28:20.280* :  migrants towards the end of last year. That prompted the Finns to close the border entirely.
*28:20.640- 28:26.380* :  Danny Aeberhardt, farmers in France say they plan to cut off access to Paris in their latest
*28:26.380- 28:31.600* :  protests on Monday. They say they'll set up roadblocks on all the main motorways into the capital.
*28:32.100- 28:36.360* :  They've already gained some concessions after demonstrations in the south of the country last week.
*28:36.880- 28:41.100* :  There's been similar action in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands amid complaints of falling
*28:41.100- 28:46.640* :  incomes, rising bureaucracy and unfair competition. From Paris, his, you scothield.
*28:46.960- 28:51.660* :  After a lull over the weekend, France's farmer protest took set to hot up again, with the focus
*28:51.660- 28:56.400* :  now no longer the south, but the much more politically sensitive terrain of the capital itself.
*28:56.400- 29:01.060* :  The main farmers' unions are warning of a military-style operation, with hundreds of
*29:01.060- 29:05.560* :  tractors maneuvering into place from early afternoon to stop traffic on all the motorways
*29:05.560- 29:09.880* :  leading into Paris. Their aim is to stop deliveries of food to supermarkets,
*29:10.320- 29:14.640* :  and thus, if possible, get the buying urban public to feel a little of the pinch.
*29:14.640- 29:19.740* :  The government is unlikely to do much to stop them. The farmer's cause is a popular one,
*29:19.740- 29:24.820* :  and police have not interviewed one so far to lift any of the roadblocks elsewhere in the country.
*29:24.820- 29:28.540* :  But the interior minister said that Paris's airports would be kept open,
*29:28.540- 29:31.600* :  and tractors would not be allowed into the capital itself.
*29:31.600- 29:36.600* :  Huescofield in the French capital. It is 40 years since the record-label
*29:36.600- 29:40.400* :  deaf jam shook up music by bringing hip hop and rap to the world.
*29:40.400- 29:44.920* :  Jacqueline Springer is a music journalist and curator of Africa and diaspora performance
*29:44.920- 29:50.240* :  at the Victoria and Albert Museum here in London. She's been telling Johnny Diamond how
*29:50.240- 29:54.440* :  deaf jam changed the world of music, and why rap still matters.
*29:59.680- 30:07.740* :  Deaf Jam is the motown of rap. It's the primary significant label that foreshadows all that came after.
*30:13.360- 30:18.140* :  The executed, the passage of rap out of New York and into the world.
*30:18.540- 30:25.580* :  Is there a breakthrough sound, a single, a breakthrough album where rap and hip hop is
*30:25.960- 30:30.380* :  commercially embraced? With deaf jam, the LLQJ can't live without my radio.
*30:35.300- 30:41.220* :  If 16-year-old just comes out and he's telling me that radio and the music that is pumped out of it
*30:41.280- 30:46.180* :  is his lifeblood, but then you have groups like Public Enemy with the production,
*30:46.300- 30:47.880* :  Technikos, Hank Shockley.
*30:52.600- 30:59.660* :  Distorts sound and it creates this cavernous, thunderous underbelly beat upon which you have two
*30:59.660- 31:06.000* :  very distinct rappers, primarily Chuck D, who's commanding sometimes. Is he actually speaking?
*31:06.000- 31:12.760* :  Is he pulpit-based in telling you that life looks like this for young black people in inner
*31:12.760- 31:16.140* :  cities across the United States, but also across the world?
*31:21.320- 31:27.240* :  Those two examples are in direct, sonic and performative contrast to the beastie boys.
*31:31.800- 31:38.400* :  Who utilize the jaggedness and the discordant rebellion of rock, and they are also like the
*31:38.400- 31:45.620* :  three stooges they purposefully find everything, witty, silly, and they also exploit and dance on
*31:45.980- 31:47.920* :  the moral values of the times.
*31:53.620- 31:59.480* :  Those who didn't like it and didn't like its message were pretty harsh on what they saw as
*31:59.500- 32:07.780* :  the adoration of drugs and crime, and the degradation of the role of women. Has that moved on?
*32:07.980- 32:13.560* :  It's one of the abiding oppositional narratives against rap, as it has been against rock and roll,
*32:13.560- 32:21.940* :  heavy metal. It's about dominantly male art form that seeks to narrate the ideal to a mass
*32:21.940- 32:28.700* :  as much money, to have sexual relations without any responsibility, to reputationally and sometimes
*32:28.700- 32:32.020* :  lyrically threatened rivals in different ways.
*32:39.660- 32:44.060* :  Is the creative energy still there 40 years on?
*32:44.380- 32:51.220* :  Yes, it absolutely is. Now and again, some people emerge that absolutely capture the time and
*32:51.220- 32:57.200* :  take you somewhere else musically and intellectually so you can have somebody like Kendrick Lamar.
*33:03.780- 33:10.500* :  You can have somebody like Andre 3000, recently releasing an album that isn't a rap album, at all.
*33:13.820- 33:19.500* :  But he's able to actually cultivate this because he's a musical being who utilizes rap as his
*33:19.500- 33:24.620* :  primary means of musical expression. But you've also got younger artists like Ice Spice,
*33:24.860- 33:34.580* :  linguistic play is deliberately slow, very languid in her tales of romantic concern and contempt.
*33:39.960- 33:42.020* :  Jacqueline Springer talking to Johnny Diamond.
