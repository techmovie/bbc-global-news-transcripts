*01:37.240- 01:42.460* :  I'm Robin Brant and in the early hours of Saturday the 20th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:42.460- 01:48.240* :  Japan has confirmed that it's become the 5th country to land a space craft on the moon successfully,
*01:48.240- 01:53.540* :  although there's now a problem with its power supply. The UN has accused the Israeli military
*01:53.540- 01:59.160* :  of blocking an increasing number of aid deliveries to Northern Gaza. And the Hollywood actor Alec
*01:59.160- 02:05.100* :  Baldwin is facing a new manslaughter charge over a fatal shooting on a film set more than two years ago.
*02:07.180- 02:10.700* :  Also coming up in this podcast. I'm very surprised that we've taken a
*02:10.700- 02:17.640* :  measure of such a draconian measures being taken. We need to check the studies that have been
*02:17.640- 02:22.440* :  carried out on dolphin populations. I'm not convinced there's such a significant risk to them.
*02:22.580- 02:28.060* :  France is taking drastic action to try to protect dolphins, making their way through the Bay of
*02:28.060- 02:35.380* :  Biscay off its west coast. We begin this podcast though with Luna Exploration.
*02:36.580- 02:42.860* :  Now you see on the left hand side, MLM, that means it has landed.
*02:43.400- 02:48.420* :  That was the moment and it's still a rare moment that marks a major scientific achievement.
*02:48.460- 02:54.040* :  That Japan landed a space craft on the moon. It's only the 5th country to do it successfully.
*02:54.740- 02:59.920* :  In true Japanese style, they tried to get it within 100 meters of the target landing zone on the
*02:59.920- 03:05.760* :  surface. But then a short time later, back on planet Earth, Japan's space agency realized there
*03:05.760- 03:12.480* :  was a problem having made contact with the spacecraft on the surface. The solar cell is not
*03:12.480- 03:18.660* :  generating electricity at this point in time. And since we are not able to generate electricity,
*03:18.700- 03:22.880* :  and so the operation is being done using batteries on load.
*03:23.240- 03:27.220* :  So what went wrong and what now are the prospects? Well, I asked our science correspondent,
*03:27.220- 03:31.520* :  Jonathan Amos. Firstly, if the landing could be considered a success.
*03:32.040- 03:38.480* :  That is success, but they are now in a race against time. So the spacecraft is operating solely on
*03:38.480- 03:42.980* :  its batteries because for whatever reason, and we don't know yet the reason,
*03:43.820- 03:49.520* :  its solar cells are not collecting sunlight and generating electricity. So it can't top up those
*03:50.220- 03:56.060* :  batteries and they will discharge over time and they may discharge completely within a few hours.
*03:56.100- 04:01.820* :  And at that point, then the slim lander will go silent. It will cease to receive commands and it
*04:01.820- 04:08.460* :  will cease to send signals to Earth. But in the meantime, yes, Japan can celebrate the fact that
*04:08.460- 04:14.900* :  they have soft landed on the moon. That's no mean feat. As we've been saying, they're only the fifth
*04:15.360- 04:20.680* :  nation to achieve that in the history of space exploration. So that is something. And also,
*04:20.680- 04:26.200* :  it does appear that their precise navigation technology did put the spacecraft down just where
*04:26.200- 04:32.280* :  they wanted it. They wanted to be able to get to within this landing point, near this equatorial
*04:32.280- 04:37.320* :  crater, to within 100 meters. That's quite something, isn't it? That doesn't usually happen, does it?
*04:37.320- 04:44.220* :  No, I mean, normally they don't have GPS at the moon, right? So it's difficult. And
*04:44.240- 04:48.200* :  previous missions, you know, you would talk about accuracies of several kilometers.
*04:48.500- 04:52.280* :  So what did they go for? And if they've only got a few hours, what can they actually do?
*04:52.620- 04:58.040* :  So what they do is they prioritize now the information that they most need. And because this
*04:58.040- 05:02.840* :  mission was about proving those navigation technologies, they're going to download all of the data
*05:02.840- 05:08.200* :  that they can about the descent and how well the algorithms, the software on board worked.
*05:08.340- 05:13.020* :  If they get that down, fantastic. Love a few pictures as well. That might help them understand
*05:13.020- 05:17.140* :  why the solar cells are not working. Just finally, it's not very often we get a chance to say this,
*05:17.140- 05:22.140* :  but it hasn't been a great week for landing on the moon. Why are countries still going, though?
*05:22.240- 05:26.360* :  And is that going to persist? Yeah, I mean, there's so much science still to do at the moon.
*05:26.360- 05:31.240* :  The earth constantly recycles its rocks. If you wonder, understand their history of the earth,
*05:31.240- 05:36.600* :  the planets, their place in the solar system, the earth is one of the most useless places to do that
*05:36.600- 05:42.560* :  because it basically overrides the record. You go to places where that record still exists and
*05:42.560- 05:48.240* :  that's on asteroids and it's on the moon. Jonathan Amos there. 2,000 people using one
*05:48.240- 05:54.940* :  shower, 500 people using just a single toilet. The United Nations has highlighted these figures as
*05:54.940- 06:00.260* :  it repeats its warning about the severe lack of drinking water and other basic hygiene in Gaza.
*06:00.860- 06:05.980* :  It says diseases like diarrhea are spreading. I heard more from neta-trophic, are you
*06:05.980- 06:10.580* :  being correspondent in New York? The latest we're hearing from the United Nations is that the
*06:10.580- 06:17.020* :  availability of water for drinking is really shrinking every single day. They are at less than
*06:17.020- 06:21.780* :  a tenth of production when you look at the wells that they've been using. They are at less than
*06:21.780- 06:27.580* :  50% of capacity when you look at the fact that they are now down to just one line that is
*06:27.580- 06:33.980* :  really operated. They used to be able to use three Israeli lines and beyond that they are
*06:33.980- 06:39.980* :  concerned about the spread of diseases. They are already seeing an increase in diarrhea cases,
*06:39.980- 06:45.720* :  more than half of them among children under five. 500 people are sharing one toilet, other
*06:45.720- 06:50.460* :  situations they don't have any and there's open defecation. Again, concern about that leading to
*06:50.460- 06:56.160* :  disease outbreaks. So they've really kind of tried to show just how desperate the situation is
*06:56.160- 07:01.780* :  because they are trying to get more aid in and coming up against numerous hurdles.
*07:02.040- 07:07.400* :  And just quickly on that, those hurdles, what is it the UN says they are or rather who are they?
*07:07.600- 07:13.000* :  Well, look, they've been having rejections with little or no explanation which has disrupted
*07:13.000- 07:18.180* :  the flow of critical supplies from the Israeli military. They say that those denials have
*07:18.180- 07:23.580* :  dramatically increased, especially access to North Gaza this month. So for example, they say that
*07:23.580- 07:29.880* :  95% of missions to bring fuel and medicines to the health facilities that are barely functioning
*07:29.900- 07:36.220* :  to those water reservoirs and wells to get clean water to people, 95 of those missions were
*07:36.220- 07:41.960* :  denied by the Israeli military. And even trying to get water testing kits in and chlorine to treat
*07:41.960- 07:48.760* :  water, they've been hit with import restrictions. Convoys have been hit, roads have been impossible,
*07:48.760- 07:53.760* :  but again, it's these kind of repeated denials with no explanation that is frustrating them.
*07:54.020- 07:59.360* :  And does the UN finally say anything about what it can do to try and change that situation?
*07:59.360- 08:03.740* :  It sounds like the UN is saying it can do very, very little. I mean, yeah, we've heard kind of a
*08:03.740- 08:09.100* :  clear call by the UN Secretary General in every part of the UN system saying that they need a
*08:09.100- 08:13.460* :  ceasefire first and foremost. The Secretary General has said he's been troubled by clear
*08:13.460- 08:20.420* :  violations of international humanitarian law. Now, aside from that, we have seen that members
*08:20.420- 08:26.860* :  of the Security Council have passed a resolution that set up a coordinator to try to streamline
*08:26.860- 08:32.580* :  getting aid in. A cigarette cog has been meeting with different parties, but we haven't yet
*08:32.580- 08:36.660* :  seen that make any material impact on the ground yet.
*08:37.080- 08:42.720* :  Neutrophic in New York City. Well, meanwhile, Israeli tanks have mounted a new assault on
*08:42.720- 08:48.400* :  southern Gaza's main city, Card Unis, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have taken refuge
*08:48.400- 08:53.600* :  from fighting in other parts of the territory. Many people have now fled from the grounds of
*08:53.600- 08:59.460* :  NASA Hospital, the biggest of the very few hospitals still functioning in Gaza. Doctors
*08:59.460- 09:06.000* :  there deny Israeli claims that Hamas fighters are using it as a base. Let's go to Sierra Leone
*09:06.000- 09:11.320* :  next, where the former president, Ernest Bikeroma, has flown out of the country to Nigeria,
*09:12.120- 09:16.340* :  despite having been accused of involvement in an attempted coup late last year.
*09:16.880- 09:22.260* :  Our Africa editor, Will Ross, has more. Photos show Ernest Bikeroma being welcomed by officials
*09:22.260- 09:28.400* :  at Abuja Airport. It appears he's gone into exile, at least temporarily. For weeks, the former
*09:28.400- 09:33.160* :  president of Sierra Leone was under house arrest. The government had linked him to November's attacks
*09:33.160- 09:38.320* :  on a barracks and a prison that it described as an attempted coup. He was charged with treason,
*09:38.840- 09:42.680* :  but with tension already high in Sierra Leone after last June's disputed election,
*09:42.680- 09:47.540* :  international mediators were brought in, and sources have told the BBC that an agreement was
*09:47.540- 09:52.600* :  reached for Mr. Caroma to move to Nigeria in exchange for the treason charge being dropped.
*09:53.480- 09:58.880* :  A new criminal charge of involuntary manslaughter has been filed against the actor Alec Baldwin
*09:59.400- 10:04.780* :  over a shooting on a movie set in 2021. The actor was preparing to film a scene in the
*10:04.780- 10:10.880* :  western rust in New Mexico when his pistol went off, killing the cinematographer Alina Hutchins.
*10:10.880- 10:17.220* :  Baldwin was initially charged with manslaughter in January 2023, but the charges were later dropped.
*10:17.260- 10:21.700* :  My colleague, Julia Marshall, got the latest from our LA correspondent, Emma Vardy.
*10:22.000- 10:27.300* :  Last year, the charges were dismissed because a forensic report showed that the gun could have gone
*10:27.300- 10:31.260* :  off. It had been modified in such a way that potentially could have gone off without the trigger
*10:31.260- 10:36.640* :  being pulled. And Alec Baldwin has always argued that he didn't pull the trigger. He was just holding
*10:36.640- 10:41.680* :  the pistol and getting ready to rehearse, getting ready to film this scene. But the forensic testing
*10:41.680- 10:47.760* :  on this gun continued and now a fresh report basically goes against the conclusions of the old
*10:47.760- 10:53.520* :  one. And that means that these new charges are now facing Alec Baldwin. He continues to maintain
*10:53.520- 10:59.140* :  that he did not know there was live ammunition in the gun and that he was trusting the professionals
*10:59.140- 11:03.880* :  who handed it to him. And this is something that's been a debate within the film industry too,
*11:04.380- 11:08.460* :  actors unions arguing that actors on set should be able to trust professional
*11:08.460- 11:15.120* :  armors who are trained to handle the weapons on set. So a key question in this trial is going to be
*11:15.500- 11:20.160* :  how did those live ammunition end up on set? That should have been banned. There should have been no
*11:20.160- 11:26.380* :  live ammunition on set at all. And also Alec Baldwin's actions himself. Was he negligent?
*11:26.380- 11:31.400* :  Should he have done more checks himself when he was holding that pistol? So the case now goes
*11:31.400- 11:38.080* :  to trial and understand the movie's armorer Hannah O'Gudierre's read. It is also facing the same
*11:38.080- 11:43.140* :  charge. That's right. She's also facing the charge of involuntary manslaughter. She's also
*11:43.140- 11:50.240* :  indicated that she intends to plead not guilty. Interestingly, the family of Helena Hutchins
*11:50.500- 11:55.120* :  had given their blessing to the film continuing to be finished. They wanted to see her work
*11:55.120- 12:00.880* :  showcased and the film did carry on filming after her death eventually and has now concluded.
*12:00.880- 12:05.880* :  But they've also reacted to this fresh charge today saying they do welcome a criminal trial
*12:05.880- 12:09.100* :  because they've always looked for the truth about what happened that day.
*12:09.580- 12:15.080* :  Emma Vardy reporting from L.A. France is taking drastic action to try to protect dolphins
*12:15.080- 12:19.620* :  making their way through the Bay of Biscay off its west coast at this time of year.
*12:20.000- 12:25.800* :  It's spanning most commercial fishing for a month. The restrictions are intended to stop dolphins
*12:25.800- 12:32.340* :  getting caught and then dying in fishing nets in the area. Our Europe original editor Alice Adely
*12:32.340- 12:38.900* :  has more. There has long been pressure in France to do something about the hundreds of dead dolphins
*12:38.900- 12:44.200* :  and purposes that are washed up on beaches on France's Atlantic coast every year,
*12:44.720- 12:48.980* :  most having been caught in trawler nets in the Bay of Biscay between France and Spain.
*12:48.980- 12:54.540* :  The French government has announced that from Monday no vessels, either French or foreign,
*12:54.960- 12:59.100* :  will be allowed to fish in those waters for a month. Speaking on French television,
*12:59.100- 13:04.020* :  the ecology minister said it was a challenge to balance the interests of the environment
*13:04.020- 13:09.560* :  with those of the economy and that the fishing industry would be compensated for up to 85%
*13:09.660- 13:16.240* :  of its losses. But French fishermen have reacted angrily and say the dolphins are not an endangered
*13:16.240- 13:23.060* :  species in the area. Pascal Bouillot is the director of the La Rochelle Fishing Port Association.
*13:27.360- 13:32.320* :  I'm very surprised such a draconian measure has been taken. We need to check the analysis and
*13:32.320- 13:37.060* :  look at the studies that have been carried out on dolphin populations. I'm not convinced there's
*13:37.060- 13:42.220* :  such a significant risk to them. An entire industry is being jeopardised and the fishermen have
*13:42.220- 13:46.780* :  shown their willingness to put in place protective measures to deter the capture of dolphins.
*13:46.780- 13:52.860* :  It's really brutal to see a measure like this being taken. Meanwhile, environmentalists say more than
*13:52.860- 14:00.200* :  80% of dead dolphins sink or decompose at sea rather than wash ashore, suggesting the real figure
*14:00.200- 14:05.440* :  of deaths is far higher and the ban should last longer. Alice Adley reporting.
*14:07.840- 14:13.620* :  Still to come, Saudi Arabia's disruption of sport continues. Are you ready for Snooker's golden balls?
*14:14.060- 14:18.860* :  I'm a purist and a traditionalist. You know, some sort of innovation is nice into the game,
*14:18.860- 14:22.360* :  maybe into the rules or something like that, but I don't know about the golden ball. I'll have
*14:22.360- 14:28.220* :  it's going to work. Remarkable personal stories.

*16:07.880- 16:12.880* :  from Germany's leader to his people. An ethos and dodge don't need Vida Plattsheim darf.
*16:13.260- 16:16.420* :  If there is something that can never ever have a place in Germany again,
*16:16.420- 16:22.880* :  it's the racist ideology of national socialists. That is what the extremists disgusting deportation
*16:22.900- 16:27.460* :  plans amount to. They are an attack on our democracy and therefore on all of us.
*16:28.200- 16:33.600* :  It's on us to act now to take a clear stand for solidarity, for tolerance and for our democratic
*16:37.260- 16:42.300* :  Germany. That was part of a video message from the Chancellor Olaf Schultz as protests across
*16:42.300- 16:47.240* :  the country continue against the rise of the far right alternative for Germany party.
*16:47.700- 16:52.020* :  Spontaneous demonstrations have taken place in major cities. This was an event in Hamburg.
*17:00.000- 17:05.500* :  Or protestors there shouting all of Hamburg hates the AFD. More large gatherings are planned
*17:05.500- 17:10.540* :  in the coming days. The demonstrations started after reports that extremist politicians
*17:11.220- 17:17.340* :  including AFD members met in secret late last year to discuss plans to expel millions of
*17:17.340- 17:22.780* :  immigrants from Germany. Opinion polls also suggest that support for the party is increasing.
*17:22.860- 17:26.740* :  I got more on this from our Berlin correspondent Stemian McGuinness.
*17:27.180- 17:31.260* :  Over the past week, really almost on a daily basis, somewhere in Germany,
*17:31.260- 17:35.540* :  there have been these sorts of protests. So there have been a really large one in Cologne
*17:35.580- 17:42.740* :  earlier this week. Every day almost in some German city or town, there have been protests with
*17:42.740- 17:47.260* :  thousands and thousands of people taking to streets, all with the same message, all of them saying
*17:47.880- 17:53.940* :  that Germany has to stand up against the far right and in particular the far right AFD party.
*17:53.940- 18:00.000* :  And it all comes on the back of a very controversial report, which is really rocks the country,
*18:00.880- 18:07.800* :  revealing a secret meeting in which far right activists, including some high ranking AFD members,
*18:08.520- 18:15.440* :  were planning supposedly a so-called master plan to deport millions of people with non-German
*18:15.440- 18:22.180* :  background. And it's really sparked off an outcry across the country within political circles,
*18:22.180- 18:26.580* :  but also with people on the streets saying they're not going to take this anymore. So it actually
*18:26.580- 18:32.820* :  has sort of become a large movement in many German cities really. And we're seeing a liberalisation
*18:32.920- 18:40.280* :  of Germany's citizenship laws. It's a very important part of Olaf Schultz's policy aims, I think.
*18:40.280- 18:46.080* :  Is that partly a response to what we've just been talking about the AFD or is this effort to
*18:46.700- 18:52.080* :  widen the availability of dual citizenship in Germany abroad initiative? What we're seeing is
*18:52.080- 18:56.400* :  two things happening at the same time. On the one hand, as we've been discussing the rise of
*18:56.400- 19:01.960* :  a far right, it's undeniable the polling numbers are unprecedented. On the other hand, Germany is
*19:02.240- 19:07.420* :  becoming an increasing diverse country. It's more open to migration than it ever has been. It's
*19:07.420- 19:13.080* :  it's got a very left-wing government right now, left-wing led government. And more and more
*19:13.080- 19:17.840* :  younger people in particular are very open to the idea of migration. And the debate in Germany is
*19:17.840- 19:23.300* :  very pro-migration. There's there's a general consensus that foreign workers are needed that
*19:23.300- 19:27.760* :  this is an ageing population, that the economy for society in general migration is a good thing.
*19:28.700- 19:32.640* :  So you have these two things happening at the same time. And this new law, which is really
*19:32.640- 19:37.980* :  loosening citizenship for migrants coming to Germany, in which is going to be what probably one
*19:37.980- 19:43.140* :  of the most liberal in Europe. I think this is showing one direction Germany's going. And the
*19:43.140- 19:50.680* :  at the same time, you've also got this rise in, in some cases, some quite anti-migrant feeling.
*19:50.680- 19:56.220* :  And in some cases, clearly xenophobic feeling. And some quite radical ideas about what it means to
*19:56.220- 20:00.960* :  be German, different classes of Germans. And if you have a migration background to your second class
*20:00.960- 20:06.080* :  citizen compared to someone who is so-called original German. So I think those two things are
*20:06.140- 20:11.200* :  happening at the same time in Germany. And that's making for a very lively political debate to put
*20:11.200- 20:16.500* :  it mildly. Demi and McGinnis reporting from Berlin. Now Britain's Prince Harry, the King's
*20:16.500- 20:21.720* :  youngest son, who now lives in the United States, has stopped legal action against a tabloid
*20:21.720- 20:27.300* :  newspaper over claims that it libeled him. At the last possible moment, the Prince withdrew on
*20:27.300- 20:32.500* :  Friday his libel claim against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday. It concerned an article about
*20:32.500- 20:38.000* :  his security arrangements when he visits the UK and who should pay for them. The Prince will now
*20:38.000- 20:43.580* :  have to pay legal costs for both sides, running into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our media
*20:43.580- 20:49.000* :  correspondent David Silliter has more. In Prince Harry's ongoing legal war against Britain's newspapers,
*20:49.000- 20:54.100* :  this is perhaps a minor battle. But after a series of victories against the Mail in the Mirror,
*20:54.100- 21:00.320* :  it is a climb down by the Prince. The dispute is about an article in the Mail on Sunday in 2022
*21:00.320- 21:06.220* :  about his tussle with a home office of a paying for his security arrangements. The piece headlined
*21:06.220- 21:11.220* :  how Prince Harry tried to keep his legal fight with the government over police bodyguards
*21:11.220- 21:15.520* :  a secret, said he was responsible for attempting to mislead and confuse the public
*21:15.520- 21:21.020* :  as to the true position about when he'd made the offer to pay. The Prince said there was no
*21:21.020- 21:26.140* :  deception and that he'd made the offer to pay in 2020. The Mail on Sunday argued
*21:26.140- 21:32.500* :  their article was an honest opinion and didn't cause him much harm. A full trial was looming.
*21:32.500- 21:37.240* :  But today the case was dropped just before a deadline for legal documents to be submitted.
*21:37.820- 21:42.920* :  And media lawyer Jonathan Codd feels that deadline may have had a bearing on the decision.
*21:43.240- 21:49.460* :  There's a point in every law case where both sides have to exchange documents. It's called
*21:49.460- 21:55.300* :  disclosure. Some of the documents were very sensitive. It may be something which is very confidential
*21:55.300- 22:01.040* :  or very private. At the point where Prince Harry has had to disclose these documents, which was
*22:01.040- 22:06.020* :  10 o'clock this morning, rather than disclosing his documents, he's written to the judge and
*22:06.020- 22:11.900* :  he's withdrawn his case. The legal bill will be sizable, but this is just one of many cases.
*22:12.320- 22:18.280* :  A much bigger claim, accusing the mail of phone hacking and other illegal practices is still going
*22:18.280- 22:24.320* :  ahead, so to another against the publisher of the Sun. This is far from the end of Prince Harry
*22:24.320- 22:30.600* :  versus the press. David Tilletto. Now Britain's military has used lasers to shoot down drones for
*22:30.600- 22:35.200* :  the first time. As the war in Ukraine and also events in the Middle East have highlighted,
*22:35.200- 22:40.620* :  the threat from drones and the ability to take them out will become important in future wars
*22:40.620- 22:45.860* :  and conflicts. Here's more from our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel. Scientists from the
*22:45.860- 22:50.920* :  British Defence Ministry's research laboratory, Paulton Downe, have been working on laser weapons
*22:50.920- 22:57.140* :  for a number of years and have developed dragon fire, the UK's first directed energy weapon.
*22:58.000- 23:02.760* :  Using an intense beam of light, he can target an object the size of a coin from a kilometer away.
*23:03.500- 23:08.280* :  It's been tested in the Scottish Hebrides and has successfully brought down drones flying
*23:08.280- 23:14.100* :  several kilometers away. The Ministry says the technology could transform modern warfare
*23:14.680- 23:20.740* :  and prove far cheaper than using conventional weapons. The missiles currently being fired by royal
*23:20.740- 23:26.560* :  navy warships to shoot down houthy drones in the Red Sea cost at least a million dollars each.
*23:27.140- 23:33.200* :  The laser will be the equivalent of 12 dollars a shot. However, developing dragon fire is not cheap.
*23:33.200- 23:39.760* :  It's already cost 120 million dollars and might not prove as effective as missiles in destroying
*23:39.760- 23:46.300* :  fast-moving targets. Unlike a missile, the laser also needs its target within visual range.
*23:47.440- 23:52.500* :  The US military has been investing heavily in energy-directed weapons but while it too has
*23:52.500- 23:58.720* :  successfully tested them, they've yet to be proven in combat. That could still be years away.
*23:59.180- 24:04.840* :  Jonathan Beal, let's look at artificial intelligence now. Imagine a situation where a chat bot,
*24:04.860- 24:10.120* :  a kind of automated online voice, accuses you of something that's not only untrue,
*24:10.680- 24:14.620* :  but could also be professionally damaging. What would you do? What could you do?
*24:15.220- 24:19.120* :  Well, this is what happened to my colleague, the BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman,
*24:19.640- 24:23.460* :  and it was quite a strange experience for her. She told Rebecca Kesby, what happened?
*24:23.780- 24:27.140* :  It was a really strange experience. I started getting messages from people saying they'd
*24:27.140- 24:32.480* :  seen something on social media about me that I should have a look at. It turned out to be a list
*24:32.480- 24:37.700* :  of the top 10 spreaders of disinformation on X, the platform for me named is Twitter,
*24:38.220- 24:43.980* :  and I was at number 9. It's said it had been generated by a chat bot called Groc,
*24:43.980- 24:49.560* :  which is run by Elon Musk's company XAI. I was quite concerned about it because
*24:49.560- 24:55.180* :  obviously that is not a list that as a journalist I want to be on. I decided to see what I could
*24:55.180- 25:01.680* :  do about it, and I found the path very, very difficult to navigate. I asked a chat GPT and Google's
*25:01.720- 25:06.000* :  barred to come up with a similar list and both of them declined and said it would be irresponsible
*25:06.000- 25:13.660* :  for them to do it. Then I decided to contact regulators here in the UK because we have been told
*25:13.660- 25:18.620* :  that that is how you should complain about AI contents. I went to two different authorities and
*25:18.620- 25:23.220* :  they both told me that it wasn't them, and I'd have to get legal advice. Then I went to a lawyer
*25:23.680- 25:28.960* :  who said I could possibly sue for defamation, but I had no sort of, well, it wasn't guaranteed
*25:28.960- 25:33.140* :  that I would win because there's no legal precedent for this yet. Well, this is the thing, isn't it?
*25:33.140- 25:38.000* :  If this was a person doing this, you would be able to sue them. Exactly. I mean, it's very clear,
*25:38.000- 25:42.180* :  you know, you and I talking on the radio, we know very well what we can and can't say about
*25:42.180- 25:46.200* :  someone and they know how to complain if they think that we've said something about them that's
*25:46.200- 25:50.860* :  inaccurate. But when you're dealing with content generated by AI, it's actually much more difficult
*25:50.860- 25:57.100* :  to know which path to go down, and this is only going to become, I think, more of an issue as AI
*25:57.100- 26:03.060* :  starts to generate more content and make more decisions about us. It's worth saying in this case
*26:03.100- 26:08.280* :  that it turned out, I spoke to our colleagues at BBC Verify, who look into misinformation, and they
*26:08.280- 26:15.540* :  think that it's possible the post itself was fake. So that's sort of another angle to the story,
*26:15.540- 26:19.740* :  isn't it? But the fact was that in the moment, trying to navigate how to complain about it was
*26:19.920- 26:25.020* :  very, very difficult. Very briefly, Zoe, I mean, governments and regulators have got to get on top
*26:25.020- 26:29.500* :  of this quickly. Don't they? How far off are they from being able to legislate on this stuff?
*26:29.620- 26:36.860* :  There's lots of regulation and legislation incoming, but not much of it is in place yet. The EU AI
*26:36.860- 26:41.620* :  Act is probably the strictest, but that's not actually likely to become law until 2025.
*26:42.680- 26:49.300* :  Zoe Kleinman on her experience with AI. Now, let's go to sport next. Saudi Arabia's big money push
*26:49.300- 26:55.200* :  into the sector continues with Snooker. A new event in the capital Riyadh in March will see the
*26:55.200- 27:01.920* :  introduction of a new golden ball. A new ball and new rules, while unsurprisingly, it's controversial.
*27:02.480- 27:08.500* :  Andy Swiss can explain. In a sport of tradition, it certainly caused a stir. When Snooker holds
*27:08.500- 27:14.940* :  its first TV event in Saudi Arabia in March, there'll be an extra golden ball worth 20 points
*27:14.940- 27:21.360* :  available to anyone who makes a maximum 147 break. Further details, such as whether the ball will be
*27:21.360- 27:27.240* :  on the table throughout the match, still aren't clear. Kendoherty is a former world champion.
*27:27.540- 27:33.600* :  You know, I'm a purist and a traditionalist. You know, some sort of innovation is nice into the
*27:33.600- 27:37.240* :  game, maybe into the rules or something like that, but I don't know about the golden ball. Have
*27:37.240- 27:43.580* :  us going to walk. 147 has always been one of sport's most famous numbers. The maximum break was
*27:43.580- 27:49.620* :  first achieved at the World Championships by Cliff Thorben in 1983. Oh, good luck, mate.
*27:51.580- 28:00.580* :  Oh, wonderful. But a 20 point golden ball would raise that maximum to 167 and recreational players
*28:00.580- 28:05.860* :  at this club in Manchester remain to be convinced. I think they're making it a bit more spectacular.
*28:06.500- 28:10.020* :  You know, I'm just trying to think, right, if you have any over here, we're going to do some
*28:10.020- 28:14.600* :  special. So I think the proof would be in the pudding morning. It does smell a bit of a gimmick
*28:14.620- 28:18.980* :  to me to be honest, because I think at 147 is pretty much one of the hardest things you can do in sport.
*28:20.580- 28:25.440* :  For some of the games, biggest stars, though, Snooker's traditional colors of red, yellow, green,
*28:25.440- 28:31.820* :  brown, blue, pink and black could soon have a golden edition. Andy Swiss, right, let's end the
*28:31.820- 28:38.220* :  podcast on Apple. No, not that Apple, an actual Apple. When was the last time you tried a new type
*28:38.220- 28:43.640* :  of Apple? There's big business in trying to get us to change our buying habits, but it can be a
*28:43.640- 28:48.920* :  slow process. It can take almost a decade to produce just one new type of Apple. And then there's
*28:48.920- 28:54.360* :  no guarantee it will be a success when it hits the shops. Well, Ruth Alexander, who presents the
*28:54.360- 28:59.640* :  Food Chain Programme on the BBC World Service, finds out more about how to invent a new type of Apple.
*29:00.020- 29:07.840* :  Discovery, Cox, Howgate Wunder, Lachston, Superb, Charles Ross, James Greve, Fault Stuff, Katie
*29:07.840- 29:13.880* :  over there, and then Brae Boons. I've done Brambley. Howgate Wunder. I love these names.
*29:13.940- 29:19.220* :  And Lane's Prince Albert over there, the old one that my father's heart should contain, yeah.
*29:19.500- 29:24.400* :  Alan Hewitt and his son Chris grow all sorts of apples for their Dunham press cider and juice,
*29:24.400- 29:28.940* :  near Manchester, England, and are adapting what they do due to changing weather conditions,
*29:29.520- 29:34.800* :  more on that shortly. But I hadn't realised so many Apple varieties were created by people.
*29:34.800- 29:40.280* :  So what's it like to see a brand new Apple you've had a hand in inventing, hit the shops?
*29:40.980- 29:45.840* :  That's an amazing feeling when it not only you see it on the shelf, but you see people buy it.
*29:46.060- 29:51.780* :  That's really exciting. Professor Kate Evans is a fruit breeder at Washington State University
*29:51.780- 29:56.980* :  in the United States. She was involved in the development of the Cosmic Crisp Apple.
*29:57.480- 30:01.780* :  Went on sale in 2019 and already has a sizable market share.
*30:02.580- 30:09.260* :  There are many, many reasons why an Apple makes it or not. That one, it fitted
*30:10.020- 30:15.260* :  what growers were looking for in terms of when it harvest and it stools very well.
*30:16.780- 30:22.620* :  Who comes up with the name? The Cosmic Crisp main came up from a fabulous colleague of mine,
*30:22.620- 30:28.020* :  Carolyn Ross from the School of Food Science, who ran some consumer focus groups for us.
*30:28.220- 30:35.380* :  And one consumer came up with the word Cosmic because the white and enter cells on the skin of
*30:35.380- 30:42.300* :  the fruit reminded them of stars in the cosmos and the crisp was just an obvious one once you
*30:42.300- 30:46.680* :  bit the Apple. So it came down to a genius consumer. There you go. Yes.
*30:47.240- 30:51.400* :  Creating and then selling your delicious new Apple is an expensive business.
*30:51.960- 30:56.660* :  For this reason many of the big Apple brands are what's known as club varieties.
*30:57.260- 31:01.800* :  You need to put the investment in to get it planted and you need to put the investment in to get
*31:01.800- 31:07.280* :  it known. This is Ali Kappa who chairs British apples and pairs and organisation for commercial
*31:07.280- 31:13.760* :  growers. So a way of doing that is to create a club or an exclusivity around a variety.
*31:14.620- 31:21.280* :  And what that means for a grower is that you can generally only buy it from one or a selection
*31:21.320- 31:27.860* :  of nurseries. You can't buy it everywhere. It means there's a premium on the tree and that premium
*31:27.860- 31:35.560* :  is used to help fund the marketing and often that's a global job. One new variety that's recently
*31:35.560- 31:41.360* :  been launched to tea is being marketed as the world's first variety bred specifically for a hot
*31:41.360- 31:46.120* :  climate. Developed by a partnership of scientists and growers in New Zealand and Spain,
*31:46.120- 31:50.960* :  it's hoped it'll be grown in places like Catalonia where hotter summers have been a challenge
*31:50.960- 31:56.100* :  for Apple producers. With more unpredictable weather, growers want to know they can still produce
*31:56.100- 32:00.860* :  a steady supply of apples which is where the club varieties can have an advantage.
*32:01.580- 32:07.900* :  The benefit to the consumer of the club varieties is consistency. It's really important to us as
*32:07.900- 32:13.660* :  growers that when shoppers go into store and buy apples they get a consistently high quality
*32:13.660- 32:19.940* :  brilliant product because if they don't they'll go and buy an orange or an apricot or grapes instead
*32:19.940- 32:23.480* :  next time they go in. That report by Ruth Alexander.
