*00:38.400- 00:42.720* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Wednesday the 3rd of January these are our main stories.
*00:42.720- 00:49.400* :  Hamas says it's deputy political leader Salah Al-Aruhri and two senior commanders of its armed
*00:49.400- 00:55.040* :  wing have been killed by an Israeli attack in the Lebanese capital Beirut. Two of the world's
*00:55.040- 01:00.320* :  biggest shipping firms have said they'll continue to avoid the Red Sea after more houthy attacks.
*01:00.460- 01:05.040* :  Police in Brazil are searching for hundreds of prisoners who have failed to return to prison
*01:05.040- 01:11.160* :  after being granted leave for Christmas. Also in this podcast,
*01:11.160- 01:16.920* :  Chinese schoolboy Kai Zhuang had been living with a host family and not far from Salt Lake City.
*01:16.920- 01:21.880* :  The teenager's family had been sent pictures of their son indicating he'd been abducted.
*01:22.400- 01:25.300* :  So was he or was it a case of cyber kidnapping?
*01:29.340- 01:35.380* :  We start in Lebanon. Hamas says one of its most senior leaders has been killed in an explosion
*01:35.380- 01:41.940* :  in the capital Beirut. Salah Al-Aruhri was the deputy head of its political bureau and one of the
*01:41.940- 01:48.460* :  founder members of Hamas's military wing. Local media reports say five others have been killed
*01:48.460- 01:53.620* :  in the attack and several people wound it. Video footage showed a car in flames and extensive
*01:53.620- 01:59.640* :  damage to buildings in the district of Dahia. Our diplomatic correspondent Caroline Hawley reports.
*02:06.760- 02:11.060* :  The strike happening at the southern suburb is a Beirut. Local media in Lebanon said
*02:11.060- 02:16.000* :  that Salah Al-Aruhri was killed in what it described as an Israeli drone attack on Hamas's
*02:16.000- 02:21.700* :  offices in an area that's a stronghold of its ally, Hisbullah. Some of its aids are also reported
*02:21.700- 02:27.280* :  to have died in the explosion. Hamas described it as a cowardly assassination, which would not
*02:27.280- 02:33.380* :  affect its resistance towards Israel. Salah Al-Aruhri was a very senior figure in Hamas and one of the
*02:33.380- 02:39.080* :  founders of its military wing that is a Dean Al-Khassam Brigades. Mark Regif, an advisor to Israeli
*02:39.080- 02:44.680* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told an American television station that whoever did it,
*02:44.900- 02:49.980* :  it must be clear. This was not an attack on the Lebanese state, but a surgical strike
*02:49.980- 02:55.460* :  against the Hamas leadership. Salah Al-Aruhri's home in the West Bank was destroyed by the Israeli
*02:55.460- 03:01.900* :  army on October after the deadly Hamas led assault into southern Israel. But he was living in Beirut
*03:01.900- 03:07.380* :  after being deported by Israel in 2010. Although the Israeli military has said it wouldn't comment on
*03:07.380- 03:12.580* :  foreign media reports, he's believed to have been in its sights for some time. And the strike
*03:12.580- 03:18.280* :  sends a message to Israel's enemies in the region about the reach of the IDF. It's also likely
*03:18.280- 03:23.600* :  to heighten tensions with Hisbullah, which has been engaged in almost daily exchanges of fire
*03:23.600- 03:28.740* :  across the border since October the 7th. The UN spokeswoman for the Secretary-General,
*03:28.740- 03:34.900* :  Florence Sotoninho, said the strike was very worried. The Secretary-General urged all parties to
*03:34.900- 03:40.480* :  exercise maximum restraint and take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions in the region.
*03:41.120- 03:46.920* :  I mean, he was very clear and that he's mentioned that this continued fighting has the risk
*03:46.920- 03:52.440* :  of a great miscalculation by multiple actors. And I think this is what we've been seeing
*03:52.440- 03:59.580* :  in different parts of the region, sadly. Dr. H.A. Helia is a Middle East specialist from the
*03:59.580- 04:04.000* :  London-based Defence and Security think tank, Rousey. Tim Franks asked him,
*04:04.100- 04:10.460* :  how significant does he think Salah al-Aruh is dead is? I think it's very serious. I think it's
*04:10.460- 04:16.660* :  very significant. His formal position is that he's deputy head of the Polar Bureau, but he's the
*04:16.660- 04:22.320* :  member of the Polar Bureau that is, I think, closest, or at least closer than most of them,
*04:22.800- 04:29.920* :  to his Balla and to Iran. He is from what I understand. He's one of the only ones, if not the only
*04:29.920- 04:35.860* :  one in Beirut who went into hiding following October 7th. And there were some reports indicating
*04:35.860- 04:43.580* :  that he was one of the very few outside of Gaza that knew about October 7th in advance. So he
*04:43.580- 04:49.020* :  has a big deal and I think that it's really quite a significant escalation on the part of the
*04:49.020- 04:56.000* :  Israelis to take him out. And just to be clear about this, you have absolutely no doubt that it
*04:56.000- 05:02.820* :  was the Israelis. As much as anybody can have any doubt or no doubt for that matter, we're going
*05:02.820- 05:08.160* :  off what the reports have made quite clear over the last few hours. I don't think there's any
*05:08.160- 05:13.380* :  suggestion that anybody else would have done it. He's your guest and I realize that this is all
*05:13.380- 05:19.100* :  speculation. But a lot of people are talking about, well, this could pressage an escalation and
*05:19.100- 05:25.440* :  who knows how his Balla will respond. Is your guest, though, that this was, the Israelis
*05:26.600- 05:31.480* :  will be thinking to themselves, we will just take the opportunities when they present themselves
*05:32.360- 05:39.700* :  to try and kill the senior leaders of Hamas as we have pledged to do. And it's not necessarily
*05:39.740- 05:46.740* :  part of a sequencing where the Israelis are thinking we will do this. I don't know, for example,
*05:46.740- 05:54.320* :  to test how his Balla is going to respond. I think it's more likely to be the latter than the
*05:54.320- 06:00.260* :  former. I think that when it comes to the Israelis, there has been chatter over the past month,
*06:00.260- 06:06.500* :  more than that, indicating that there are significant forces or significant personalities within
*06:06.500- 06:13.900* :  the Israeli establishment that do want to regionalize the conflict and do want to take the
*06:13.900- 06:20.000* :  opportunity at present to get into a conflict with his Balla because they don't want his Balla to
*06:20.000- 06:27.620* :  be anywhere near the southern border of Lebanon, IE the northern border of Israel. They've been warned
*06:27.620- 06:32.440* :  on multiplications by the United States and others that this would not be a good idea.
*06:33.320- 06:40.020* :  Don't take the fight to his Balla. Don't give them a reason to retaliate so that there's a huge
*06:40.020- 06:46.020* :  conflict that breaks out between his Balla and Israel. And I just don't think that they've
*06:46.020- 06:51.920* :  listened on this occasion. We've already seen reports indicating that the Israelis are preparing
*06:52.140- 07:01.220* :  for quite a significant reprisal attack by his Balla on cities in Israel. And his Balla is quite
*07:01.220- 07:07.800* :  well-armed, far better than Hamas. And it seems that they are preparing for that type of retaliation.
*07:07.860- 07:14.980* :  And of course, if there is a retaliation, then that will undoubtedly precede another retaliation
*07:14.980- 07:20.660* :  from the Israelis in response. None of this is good news. And it's one of the reasons why
*07:20.660- 07:27.780* :  calls for a ceasefire where the Israelis cease their bombardment of Gaza have been so strong
*07:27.780- 07:34.460* :  over the past couple of months because of the fear that this could spiral further out of control.
*07:34.460- 07:39.040* :  Of course, it's already out of control, but further out of control where there's a much wider
*07:39.040- 07:45.180* :  regional conflict. Dr. A. J. Helia from the Defence and Security think tank, Rousey.
*07:45.620- 07:49.560* :  Two of the world's biggest shipping firms have announced that they'll continue to avoid
*07:49.560- 07:54.120* :  sailing through the Red Sea. That's following further Houthi rebel attacks from Yemen.
*07:54.140- 07:56.680* :  Here's our business reporter, Jonathan Josephs.
*07:56.920- 08:01.900* :  Another attack on a container ship in the Red Sea over the weekend has led two of the world's
*08:01.900- 08:06.800* :  biggest shipping lines to continue avoiding the area. Denmark's Merck says it will do so
*08:06.800- 08:11.440* :  until further notice, while Germany's Hapagloid will do so for at least another week.
*08:11.440- 08:16.320* :  Both the diverting ships around the bottom of Africa as they try to keep their crews safe,
*08:16.320- 08:20.260* :  but it will add costs and delay as well as disruption to supply chains.
*08:20.920- 08:25.920* :  Houthi rebels in Yemen claim the attacks are out of sympathy with Palestinian suffering in Garza.
*08:26.720- 08:31.780* :  Next to Japan, aviation authorities in the country have launched an investigation into what
*08:31.780- 08:37.600* :  caused a dramatic collision on Tuesday between two planes at Tokyo's Haneda Airport that killed
*08:37.600- 08:44.240* :  five people. The victims were all on board a Japanese coast guard aircraft that was hit by a
*08:44.240- 08:49.260* :  passenger jet as the larger plane came into land. A footage of the incident showed a huge
*08:49.260- 08:54.900* :  fireball as the aircraft collided before the Japan Airlines jets slid down the runway,
*08:54.900- 08:58.740* :  trailing flames in its wake. Our correspondent Theo Leggett reports.
*08:59.140- 09:04.680* :  The Japan Airlines Airbus A350 was landing at Haneda Airport at the end of a routine flight when
*09:04.680- 09:09.820* :  it collided on the runway with a much smaller Dohavel and Dash 8 operated by the Japanese coast guard.
*09:09.820- 09:15.400* :  It's not yet clear why the collision occurred. The coast guard plane had been about to take off
*09:15.400- 09:19.060* :  to join relief efforts for people caught up in the earthquake that hit the country.
*09:19.060- 09:24.960* :  Five of the six people on board were killed. Although the A350 airliner subsequently burst into
*09:24.960- 09:31.940* :  flames, all 379 passengers and crew were evacuated successfully. Michelle Robson, who's a former
*09:31.940- 09:37.180* :  air traffic controller, says that was remarkable. It is astonishing with the aircraft on fire that
*09:37.180- 09:42.680* :  everybody got out safely and very quickly. So it's definitely a testament to Japan Airlines and
*09:42.740- 09:45.580* :  their crew training that they managed to get everybody out in the way they did.
*09:46.120- 09:50.320* :  Footage taken by passengers aboard the Airbus in the moments after the collision shows the
*09:50.320- 09:56.340* :  glow of flames outside and smoke slowly filling the cabin. At least 14 people on board were injured.
*09:57.100- 10:01.740* :  The accident caused severe disruption at Haneda Airport, which initially suspended all flights.
*10:02.660- 10:06.640* :  Josh Kultus was there to collect a friend and described the atmosphere in the terminal.
*10:07.160- 10:11.940* :  It was pretty scary, like the whole airport kind of just froze. Everyone's looking at
*10:11.940- 10:15.960* :  alternative ways of transport of getting home, but it's pretty difficult because it's all filling
*10:15.960- 10:20.900* :  up. You can imagine the amount of people that are now unable to get home or go to where they
*10:20.900- 10:25.580* :  need to go and are now going to look for other forms of transport. This is the first major accident
*10:25.580- 10:30.520* :  involving an A350. One of a new breed of aircraft built largely of advanced materials,
*10:30.520- 10:36.140* :  such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic. Although the plane was eventually destroyed by the flames,
*10:36.140- 10:41.260* :  experts say it appears to have stood up well initially, allowing time for those on board to escape.
*10:41.940- 10:46.080* :  Airbus says it's sending a team of specialists to Japan to assist in the investigation
*10:46.080- 10:53.120* :  into the accident. Theolegate. Mondays earthquake in Japan is now known to have killed at least 57
*10:53.120- 10:58.080* :  people. Many homes have collapsed and a huge operation is underway to search for survivors
*10:58.080- 11:03.620* :  who may be trapped in the rubble. Rescue teams have been hampered by damage to roads.
*11:04.000- 11:08.760* :  Our correspondent Jean McKenzie spent the day traveling towards the earthquake's epicenter
*11:09.100- 11:10.620* :  on the remote Noto Peninsula.
*11:14.600- 11:21.040* :  Sirens filled the air as rescue workers tried desperately to reach the worst hit areas where people
*11:21.040- 11:27.080* :  are trapped under their collapsed homes. Some dead. Others, it's hoped, still alive.
*11:27.840- 11:32.620* :  Grapshed roads are making it difficult for them to get to the remote northern tip of the
*11:32.620- 11:36.060* :  Noto Peninsula on the west coast where the earthquake struck.
*11:41.100- 11:46.520* :  This is the moment a temple nearly collapsed as families were out celebrating New Year's day.
*11:47.080- 11:50.840* :  Mimura-san thought the shrine he was visiting was going to crumble.
*11:56.720- 12:00.860* :  Theolegate was swaying. The pathway was swaying too, he told me.
*12:01.320- 12:04.540* :  The children had to squat on the floor so as not to fall over.
*12:09.500- 12:15.980* :  As we traveled towards the epicenter, we were alerted to another tremor. The aftershocks kept coming.
*12:16.760- 12:22.540* :  Further in old traditional wooden houses lay splintered, collapsed, not made to withstand
*12:22.540- 12:25.400* :  the ferocity of Japan's enduring quakes.
*12:30.700- 12:37.060* :  Iwa-hama invited me into his smashed up home. At 82, he doesn't know how he'll manage the repairs.
*12:40.780- 12:46.320* :  We always have earthquakes around here, but I just didn't think we'd get big one like this.
*12:47.000- 12:50.580* :  I didn't take it seriously. I thought we were safe here.
*12:51.060- 12:56.520* :  Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida admitted help had been slow and information scarce.
*12:56.620- 13:02.600* :  The worst of the damage is surely yet to emerge. People here have lived through many an earthquake,
*13:02.600- 13:08.460* :  but never felt one of this magnitude. Although Japan has made itself more resistant to these
*13:08.460- 13:13.680* :  disasters over the years, they still have the power to surprise and devastate the country.
*13:14.940- 13:20.860* :  Sheen McKenzie in Japan. The President of Harvard University in the United States has announced
*13:20.860- 13:27.900* :  her resignation after facing criticism over her handling of anti-Semitism on campus and of her
*13:27.900- 13:31.540* :  academic work. From Washington, here's our reporter, Will Vernon.
*13:32.060- 13:37.140* :  When she was appointed in July last year, Claudeine Gay became the first black person to hold
*13:37.140- 13:43.160* :  the prestigious post of Harvard President. But in December, Dr. Gay and other university leaders
*13:43.160- 13:48.840* :  appeared before the U.S. Congress to discuss anti-Semitism on campus, following a number of attacks
*13:48.840- 13:54.700* :  on Jewish students. Dr. Gay provoked a backlash after she failed to say whether calling for the
*13:54.700- 14:00.780* :  genocide of Jews would violate Harvard's code of conduct, saying it depended on the context.
*14:00.860- 14:06.100* :  She later apologized for her remarks, but calls for her resignation continued.
*14:06.680- 14:12.060* :  In her statement, Claudeine Gay said the decision to resign was taken in the best interests of Harvard.
*14:12.880- 14:18.540* :  Will Vernon. Next to Brazil, a country not known as being soft on criminals.
*14:18.540- 14:22.420* :  The police shoot more people there than in almost any other place in the world.
*14:22.420- 14:27.200* :  But when it comes to releasing prisoners, for special times, like Christmas, for example,
*14:27.200- 14:32.820* :  things are more lax. It's a policy that sometimes backfires and police there are now looking for
*14:32.820- 14:36.400* :  hundreds of prisoners who were released to spend time with their families over Christmas,
*14:37.020- 14:39.560* :  but didn't return to jail before New Year's Eve.
*14:39.800- 14:42.080* :  Our Americans are certainly not a Russia, so we're more.
*14:42.520- 14:48.580* :  In the state of Rio de Janeiro, it's 253 prisoners didn't come back, including three drug
*14:48.580- 14:55.700* :  lords wanted for drug trafficking and murder that are now on the list of wanted people by the police.
*14:56.320- 15:01.740* :  But that's something that has happened across the country, and it happens every year and every
*15:01.740- 15:07.440* :  break where these prisoners are released. In São Paulo, last year, they haven't released the
*15:07.440- 15:13.320* :  pictures for this year, but last year, the previous year, they had 1,400 prisoners who didn't come
*15:13.360- 15:18.000* :  back. So a lot of these people who don't come back, it seems that they don't come back year after
*15:18.000- 15:21.860* :  year. What are people in Brazil make of that? Is it quite controversial, this policy?
*15:22.160- 15:27.660* :  It is one of the many things that people say, you know, to observe about Brazil. It's surreal.
*15:27.660- 15:34.320* :  It seems to be a surreal country in many ways, and the legal system is often criticized.
*15:34.380- 15:39.460* :  As you know, it's very harsh. The prison life in Brazil, there's no condition, but the law
*15:39.460- 15:44.360* :  seems to be quite lenient. People are putting pressure on Congress to change this law. There's a bill
*15:44.920- 15:50.080* :  that's been examined, but it takes a long time for that to happen. One of the most outrageous
*15:51.200- 15:57.300* :  cases that happened that got people really furious was a few years ago when a woman very well
*15:57.300- 16:02.880* :  known for killing her own parents, upper class people in São Paulo. She was a teenager when she
*16:02.880- 16:08.540* :  killed her parents, and they're bad. She was released for Mother's Day break. So that was in
*16:08.540- 16:14.580* :  as outrageous. You have this couple sentence for throwing their own son off a window. It was a
*16:14.660- 16:20.200* :  notorious awful crime in Brazil. They've been released for children's day in Brazil. So all that
*16:20.200- 16:26.720* :  just brings a lot of anger in people and say something has to be done about that, but you have
*16:26.720- 16:34.420* :  the laws it is. It's very difficult to change legislation in Brazil in any area, and people don't
*16:34.420- 16:39.580* :  know what to be done, and people in a way say more of the same every year it happens. Leonardo
*16:39.580- 16:48.900* :  Russia. Still to come. We're seeing Bitcoin surge amid frenzied speculation about the approval
*16:48.900- 16:55.740* :  of an exchange-traded fund for Bitcoin or an ETF. So is it now the time to invest in the
*16:55.740- 17:05.820* :  world of cryptocurrency? Unmissible stories from around the globe. If there's a world or any
*17:05.820- 17:11.760* :  emergency happening to Taiwan then you know I would be also part of it. The documentary,
*17:11.900- 17:17.640* :  gripping storytelling from the BBC World Service. This has been our life since childhood,
*17:17.820- 17:24.740* :  every year, worse and difficult events. The documentary. It's a vantage point from which to
*17:24.740- 17:30.720* :  survey a new horizon. Search for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:33.000- 17:39.000* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The landlock nations often crave access to the sea and
*17:39.000- 17:44.040* :  Ethiopia's desire for a coastline has created a diplomatic spat with one of its neighbours.
*17:44.760- 17:50.000* :  The Somali government has reacted angrily to a deal seemingly made behind its back between Ethiopia
*17:50.000- 17:55.440* :  and Somali land to lease land for a port and give Addis Ababa access to the sea.
*17:55.960- 18:00.880* :  Mogadishu has described it as an act of aggression and said not an inch of territory would be
*18:00.880- 18:06.820* :  conceded. Our African regional editor Richard Hamilton looks at the historical context to this
*18:06.820- 18:13.060* :  diplomatic crisis in the Horn of Africa. Beyond the Red Sea at the straight known as Babel Mandab
*18:13.060- 18:19.080* :  or the Gate of Tears lies the Gulf of Aden. This is where Somali land is offering Ethiopia
*18:19.180- 18:26.040* :  20 kilometres of precious coastline, a lease on the port of Berbera and a long sought-after
*18:26.040- 18:33.720* :  access to the sea. The routes of this problem go back more than 30 years. In 1991 the government
*18:33.720- 18:41.780* :  of Siyad-Bare collapsed and Somalia descended into civil war. In the same year Somali land broke
*18:41.780- 18:47.520* :  away from the rest of the country but has remained internationally unrecognised to this day.
*18:48.300- 18:55.400* :  It was also in the early 1990s that Eritrea fought Ethiopia to become an independent state.
*18:56.120- 19:02.340* :  Since then Ethiopia has been landlocked and won't forget it but territorial integrity
*19:02.340- 19:10.360* :  is also a red line for Somalia. Its information minister Dowda Wase expressed Mogadishu's anger
*19:10.360- 19:16.560* :  over this deal. We call it as an illegal memorandum of understanding that does not represent
*19:16.560- 19:22.520* :  the will and the wish of the Somali people and it's also an act of aggression against Somalia.
*19:22.520- 19:27.560* :  So the whole thing legally is not fine. That's why we are rejecting it strongly.
*19:27.560- 19:35.360* :  This is Somalia property and this land is for Somalia and the Somali territory and integrity
*19:35.500- 19:42.200* :  has to be observed. Since coming to power in 2018 the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abbi Ahmed
*19:42.200- 19:48.840* :  has dreamt of making his country great again. Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize a year later
*19:48.840- 19:56.460* :  for reproachement with Eritrea, Mr Abbi has crushed Tigray, attacked Amhara and intends to build
*19:56.460- 20:03.160* :  a vast multi-billion dollar palace. Access to the ocean seems to be part of his dream.
*20:04.020- 20:11.040* :  In October he alarmed Eritrea by saying that Ethiopia needs to acquire a port to break its
*20:11.040- 20:19.200* :  people out of a geographic prison. He quoted a famous 19th century general Rasulullah who said the
*20:19.200- 20:26.060* :  Red Sea was Ethiopia's natural boundary and reminded his audience that it was also an existential
*20:26.060- 20:33.440* :  issue for Ethiopian emperors, most notably highly salassy. Perhaps this tells us less about
*20:33.440- 20:40.400* :  geopolitics than it does about the mind and ambitions of Mr Abbi. Richard Hamilton.
*20:41.520- 20:47.160* :  One of South Africa's most fearless and well-known photographers, Peter Maglbane has died
*20:47.160- 20:53.280* :  at the age of 91. He gained international acclaim during the decades of apartheid, bravely
*20:53.280- 20:58.580* :  capturing moments of appalling violence in places like Soweto, but also quiet moments that
*20:58.580- 21:05.440* :  reveal the bizarre twisted reality of segregated life. Peter Maglbane himself suffered. He was beaten
*21:05.440- 21:10.880* :  up and imprisoned by the authorities. Linda Kulis Obekwa is a young South African photographer
*21:11.260- 21:17.380* :  born after the end of apartheid 30 years ago. Tim Franks asked him, what does Peter Maglbane mean to him?
*21:17.580- 21:23.680* :  Peter Maglbane is one of the icons, one of the people who paved so many ways for many
*21:23.680- 21:29.800* :  photographers that came before him. For me he's like a freedom fighter, he's an activist,
*21:30.600- 21:34.760* :  and also he's a photographer because he risked his life to expose what was happening in South
*21:34.760- 21:42.400* :  Africa to do their apartheid times. And of course, also made work after that. So what I
*21:42.400- 21:49.480* :  make of him is someone who has told the story of this country, and if you want to reflect of
*21:49.480- 21:57.060* :  what South Africa has became, is one person who his work will actually give you that perspective.
*21:57.720- 22:07.380* :  I mean he was enormously brave, wasn't he? In the way he just refused not to document the terrible
*22:07.380- 22:13.580* :  things that were happening in front of him, but often at real risk to himself.
*22:14.020- 22:17.160* :  Definitely, I think that's what makes him very special.
*22:17.160- 22:22.000* :  You know, often the journalist will come from a different place and go photograph people
*22:22.460- 22:27.640* :  that are in suffering. And if you look at Peter's life, he was photographing what he had to live with.
*22:27.900- 22:33.420* :  So he had nothing to lose at the same time because the same struggle that was photographing
*22:33.420- 22:39.300* :  in Soweto, or as a photographing in Shavville, is something that affected him. So in one way,
*22:39.940- 22:44.100* :  you know, he was really, you know, part and part of what was happening and also trying to
*22:44.100- 22:50.880* :  document it. And some of the images were extreme, but some of them also were very, had a very
*22:50.880- 22:58.360* :  sort of quiet power to them. There was, there's one image in particular that I've seen today,
*22:58.360- 23:06.760* :  which has a black maid looking after a young white girl. Although they're sitting near each other,
*23:06.760- 23:12.360* :  they're not sitting on the same bench because because the bench that the young girl is on,
*23:12.420- 23:18.140* :  I think from memory she's having her hair sort of done by the maid. It says,
*23:18.680- 23:24.780* :  Europeans only, in other words, black people stay off this bench. And it wasn't an image of
*23:25.420- 23:31.740* :  people in great distress, or after the aftermath of violence, or indeed white police officers,
*23:32.380- 23:37.080* :  you know, shooting their guns out of a moving car, and all that sort of stuff that he also did.
*23:37.080- 23:43.540* :  But I mean, it conveyed in a way just the sort of the daily alphemous of segregation.
*23:43.760- 23:49.260* :  He had those amazing qualities of, you know, not only looking at the harshness, but also the kind of
*23:49.900- 23:54.880* :  softest things of which, you know, even though he was photographing the quietness or the less harsh
*23:54.940- 23:59.280* :  things, they were exposing so much that was happening in this country. And of course, when he was
*23:59.280- 24:04.260* :  photographing the kind of dead bodies, the horrific images, they contributed equally to what was
*24:04.260- 24:08.680* :  happening in this country. The South African photographer, Linda Cooley-Subekwa.
*24:08.880- 24:16.720* :  The cryptocurrency Bitcoin has started 2024 with a bang surging to nearly 46,000 dollars its
*24:16.720- 24:22.520* :  highest point since April 2022. The spike is attributed to an imminent decision by the U.S.
*24:22.520- 24:28.480* :  Securities and Exchange Commission. The crypto journalist and podcaster Connor Sefton spoke to
*24:28.480- 24:37.240* :  Sam Fennek about Bitcoin's ups and downs. Bitcoin rose by over 150 percent in 2023. That's
*24:37.240- 24:42.460* :  despite the fact that Sam Bankman Fried, who was the head of FTX, was found guilty of fraud.
*24:42.460- 24:48.080* :  We've had the CEO of Binance, which is one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges. He's had
*24:48.080- 24:54.880* :  to abruptly step down and despite that, we're seeing Bitcoin surge amid frenzied speculation
*24:54.880- 25:00.240* :  about the approval of an exchange-traded fund for Bitcoin or an ETF.
*25:00.780- 25:09.180* :  So explain what an ETF is. So ETFs are pretty common and these funds tend to track specific things
*25:09.180- 25:17.220* :  like stock indices like the FTZ100 or the S&P500 or maybe an ETF tracks a specific sector like
*25:17.220- 25:23.940* :  healthcare stocks or defense stocks. But in the U.S, an ETF based on Bitcoin's current value,
*25:23.940- 25:29.140* :  that's its spot price, doesn't exist yet and there's a lot of speculation that the U.S.
*25:29.140- 25:34.840* :  Securities and Exchange Commission will approve an ETF. So is that that has led this frenzy of
*25:34.840- 25:41.000* :  investment into Bitcoin? I think that the interest rate situation and the prospect of cuts in
*25:41.000- 25:46.720* :  the coming months has helped Bitcoin because it makes investors more attracted to potentially
*25:46.720- 25:53.560* :  riskier assets. And another Bitcoin specific factor is an event that happens every four years,
*25:53.900- 25:58.940* :  which is called the harving, and that refers to the amount of new Bitcoin that enters the market
*25:59.500- 26:06.820* :  every day. At the moment, 900 new Bitcoin are mined and in April, that's going to fall by 50 percent
*26:06.860- 26:13.760* :  to just 450. So it's a kind of classic supply and demand situation because if demand rises
*26:14.220- 26:19.960* :  at the same time supply falls, you know, believers in Bitcoin believe that this could cause even
*26:19.960- 26:26.040* :  further price action. That was Conor Sefton. Now, if you are into podcasts, you might well be
*26:26.040- 26:32.500* :  familiar with the name Esther Perl. She's a Belgian American psychotherapist and a daughter of two
*26:32.500- 26:38.560* :  Holocaust survivors who were the only survivors of their respective families. She says she learned from
*26:38.560- 26:44.140* :  her parents that there is a world of difference between not being dead and being alive. That
*26:44.140- 26:49.480* :  understanding has been essential for her clinical practice, best-selling books and popular podcasts,
*26:49.480- 26:55.620* :  which focus on modern relationships. Iona Hampson met her in London to find out more about her
*26:55.620- 27:01.420* :  work and her huge following online. It's incredible how much you can do in a one-time session.
*27:01.760- 27:08.240* :  The metaphor I could use for you is like sculpting. The first session of a sculpting,
*27:08.240- 27:15.220* :  you take the hammer and you slash gross shapes into the material. It's very rough,
*27:15.260- 27:20.960* :  but it's very blatant. It's very clear. You have just made these significant cuts,
*27:21.520- 27:26.960* :  then comes chiseling, and the chiseling is a long process of small little movements,
*27:26.960- 27:32.940* :  but they bring the lasting shape into being. What you don't see in a one-time consultation is the
*27:32.940- 27:38.840* :  chiseling. I think that people come ready, but I have very little idea of what exactly we will be
*27:38.840- 27:42.820* :  talking about, because it's often not what they thought they were coming to talk about,
*27:43.000- 27:47.300* :  or at least not in the way they thought it would happen. For Esther Perl, the quality of
*27:47.300- 27:52.840* :  relationships determines the quality of people's lives. While keeping up a twice-weekly psychotherapy
*27:52.840- 27:57.500* :  practice in New York, she invites an international audience to her clinic through her podcast.
*27:58.460- 28:03.620* :  Each episode is an anonymous one-time session with a couple, which includes intimate and vulnerable
*28:03.620- 28:13.020* :  exchanges. I'm wondering if I'm being gossiled by my partner. Do you need me to watch the kids
*28:13.020- 28:19.460* :  while you go with the other guys? What's it like to be someone's disappointment for 20-something
*28:19.460- 28:26.540* :  years? It's hard. At what point did you think part of your understanding of people actually comes
*28:26.540- 28:32.600* :  from you traveling, you knowing more languages, and being able to connect with people where they are
*28:32.980- 28:39.000* :  rather than just seeing it from a more academic perspective? We often think that other people think
*28:39.000- 28:43.500* :  like us, the way I conceptualize relationships, you must think of it like that too, and that is
*28:43.640- 28:49.180* :  sooner the case. But so many of us live with more than one model inside of us at this moment,
*28:49.500- 28:54.580* :  because so many of us live in cultural transition in more than one culture at the same time,
*28:54.580- 29:00.140* :  and our family may still belong to one, but we already have lived in a few others. And that
*29:00.140- 29:06.700* :  is rich, but also confusing, and sometimes tormenting. Esther says that she is witnessed in her four
*29:06.700- 29:11.860* :  decades of practicing how modern relationships have changed. Now the survivor of the family she
*29:11.860- 29:17.100* :  says is determined by the strength of the couple. She believes that conflict isn't intrinsic to
*29:17.100- 29:22.260* :  every relationship, and therefore her focus is on teaching people how to make that friction
*29:22.260- 29:28.700* :  productive. What we describe in terms of this social atrophy and the muscles that we haven't
*29:28.700- 29:35.880* :  put into practice has had a real effect on creating conflict avoidance. That means that we don't
*29:35.880- 29:43.660* :  really know how to be rubbing against people who think differently from us. And we often cut off,
*29:43.660- 29:49.720* :  we cut off from friends, we cut off from siblings, from family members, because we don't know how to
*29:49.720- 29:55.560* :  have fundamental difference of opinion, and still know that you're there for me. I'm using
*29:55.560- 30:00.820* :  how people deal with conflict once again to help people have better relationships.
*30:01.620- 30:06.320* :  The Belgian American Psychotherapist Esther Perrell, speaking to the BBC's Iona Hampson.
*30:07.000- 30:11.820* :  Now how can there be a kidnapping when nobody has been abducted? Well there is a phenomenon
*30:11.820- 30:17.500* :  called cyber kidnapping, and it's been taken very seriously by police. The latest case is in the
*30:17.500- 30:22.940* :  United States. A Chinese foreign exchange student has just been found freezing but alive in a tent
*30:22.940- 30:28.980* :  in rural Utah. After his parents were extorted out of tens of thousands of dollars, David Lewis told
*30:29.780- 30:34.620* :  Chinese schoolboy Kai Zhuang had been living with a host family and going to high school,
*30:34.620- 30:40.640* :  not far from Salt Lake City. Then on the 28th of December, his teachers there contacted the police
*30:40.640- 30:45.980* :  after Kai's parents contacted the school. The teenager's family had been sent pictures of
*30:45.980- 30:51.540* :  their son, indicating he'd been abducted, as well as a ransom demand. His mother and father
*30:51.540- 30:58.040* :  had handed over about $80,000 in desperation to the cyber criminals. Police believe the youngster
*30:58.040- 31:04.540* :  was targeted and then manipulated by scammers in this so-called cyber kidnapping. So how does the scam
*31:04.540- 31:10.580* :  work? Well fraudsters pretending to be calling from the Chinese embassy or another authority contact
*31:10.580- 31:16.640* :  students overseas and say they've been implicated in a crime back in China, then demand the people pay
*31:16.640- 31:22.800* :  fees to avoid arrest or deportation. Victims are often brought under a psychological control,
*31:22.800- 31:28.540* :  convinced to cease contact with loved ones, then coerced to fake a hostage situation
*31:28.540- 31:33.920* :  to obtain funds from relatives overseas. All the while being monitored, sometimes through
*31:33.920- 31:40.420* :  facetime or Skype. Fortunately for him, Kai was eventually found in a tent on Sunday. It's
*31:40.420- 31:47.600* :  down to about minus 10 at night there and covered in snow in Utah. Police say he'd limited food and
*31:47.600- 31:54.600* :  water, a heat blanket and sleeping bag. He had several phones, police suspect were used as part
*31:54.600- 32:00.440* :  of the kidnapping. Once being checked over for hypothermia, Kai asked to speak to his family
*32:00.440- 32:06.120* :  and then for a warm cheeseburger. And David, this is not the first time so-called cyber kidnapping
*32:06.120- 32:11.580* :  has targeted Chinese people overseas, is it? That's right. There was a slew of Chinese students in
*32:11.580- 32:17.680* :  Australia and New Zealand scammed and forced to pay massive ransom back in 2020. At least eight
*32:17.680- 32:23.460* :  of these virtual kidnappings were reported there in that single year. Authorities in Australia said
*32:23.460- 32:30.060* :  the extortion tactics were operating on an industrial scale and urged people to report any threats
*32:30.060- 32:36.480* :  they received. On some occasions, families have basically paid every cent they've got, said a
*32:36.480- 32:42.300* :  New South Wales police spokesman back then. In one of these crimes, a ransom of more than $1.4
*32:42.300- 32:49.900* :  million US dollars was paid. David Lewis. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new
*32:49.900- 32:55.420* :  addition of the Global News Podcast later on. Don't forget, we do love hearing from you. Mitchell
*32:55.420- 33:00.660* :  Tyler sent us an email saying, I've been listening to the Global News Podcast for years now,
*33:00.660- 33:05.800* :  trying to be more aware of what's going on in the world. This isn't it silly, but I wanted to send
*33:05.800- 33:10.640* :  an email about an episode in which a guest suggested using Christmas leftovers to make a curry.
*33:11.080- 33:15.260* :  Well, my Christmas dinner didn't turn out exactly as I hoped and I wasn't sure what to do with
*33:15.260- 33:20.360* :  the pork leftovers, but I was inspired by the curry suggestion and it turned out beautifully.
*33:20.360- 33:26.220* :  Last night, happy new year. Thanks for that, Mitchell. And if you want to comment on this podcast,
