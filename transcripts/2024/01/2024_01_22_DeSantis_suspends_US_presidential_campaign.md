*01:07.680- 01:12.940* :  I'm Charles Haveland, and in the early hours of Monday the 22nd of January, these are our
*01:12.940- 01:13.720* :  main stories.
*01:14.420- 01:19.200* :  Ronda Santis drops out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination and throws
*01:28.420- 01:29.760* :  his support behind the front runner, Donald Trump.
*01:30.460- 01:35.320* :  There are bloody scenes in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine after the city of Donetsk was
*01:35.320- 01:54.240* :  shelled, leaving 27 people dead, and, we hear from the first Israeli to be jailed for
*01:54.240- 01:59.680* :  refusing to join the war, as the number of dead in Gaza surpasses 25,000.
*02:03.160- 02:09.120* :  Another in this podcast, after days of protests against right-wing extremism in Germany, hundreds
*02:09.120- 02:13.460* :  of thousands take part in the biggest rallies so far, andâ€¦
*02:19.700- 02:26.540* :  One huge South Korean export, the boy band BTS, making another kimchi, as the cabbage
*02:26.540- 02:28.740* :  side dish breaks export records.
*02:33.240- 02:35.320* :  There is no clear path to victory.
*02:35.840- 02:40.340* :  The parting words of the Florida Governor Ronda Santis, as he dropped out of the 2024
*02:40.580- 02:47.200* :  U.S. presidential contest on Sunday afternoon, and endorsed his former rival and most high-profile
*02:47.200- 02:48.720* :  critic, Donald Trump.
*02:49.320- 02:54.300* :  If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops,
*02:54.300- 02:59.260* :  more interviews, I would do it, but I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time
*02:59.260- 03:03.240* :  and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.
*03:03.720- 03:06.440* :  Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.
*03:06.980- 03:10.980* :  The man once seen as the candidate with the best chance of beating Mr. Trump, as the
*03:10.980- 03:16.740* :  Republican party's nominee for 2024, suffered a 30 percentage point loss to him in last
*03:16.740- 03:18.300* :  Monday's Iowa caucuses.
*03:18.860- 03:23.960* :  His withdrawal leaves Nikki Haley, as the only rival to the ex-president for the Republican
*03:23.960- 03:24.440* :  nomination.
*03:25.440- 03:30.260* :  Our correspondent, Naomi Ikbal, is in New Hampshire, the state where the next Republican primary
*03:30.260- 03:31.620* :  will be held on Tuesday.
*03:32.260- 03:35.400* :  She told me more about why Ronda Santis decided to drop out.
*03:36.000- 03:39.280* :  I think the writing was on the wall for some time for Ronda Santis.
*03:39.400- 03:43.040* :  What's interesting about him is that he was the hot ticket after the midterm elections
*03:43.140- 03:46.520* :  in 2022 when he really smashed it in Florida.
*03:46.920- 03:49.860* :  Where I am right now, I'm in this seafood fast food restaurant.
*03:49.860- 03:53.940* :  As news came through that he was dropping out, Nikki Haley turned up here where she was
*03:53.960- 03:55.340* :  meeting in greeting supporters.
*03:55.840- 03:59.260* :  She was very complimentary about Ronda Santis and said that he was a great governor.
*03:59.260- 04:00.220* :  She wishes him well.
*04:00.220- 04:03.680* :  But then she said, I quote, it's one fella and one lady left.
*04:04.260- 04:05.940* :  And she said let the best woman win.
*04:05.940- 04:10.540* :  So it's now the two horse race that she predicted that it would be and she seems very confident
*04:10.540- 04:13.200* :  that she can beat Donald Trump for that nomination.
*04:13.480- 04:16.120* :  I've seen some news just coming in of the Trump campaign reacting.
*04:16.120- 04:18.560* :  Have you been able to assess the details of that?
*04:19.020- 04:23.680* :  Yes, so Donald Trump has welcomed the fact that Ronda Santis has now endorsed him.
*04:23.980- 04:27.300* :  It's really interesting because you know those two were really sniping at each other
*04:27.520- 04:28.640* :  over the last year or so.
*04:28.640- 04:32.220* :  Certainly Donald Trump going really hard at Ronda Santis and the star that he does.
*04:32.220- 04:35.240* :  He even said that he's going to retire his nickname,
*04:35.240- 04:38.380* :  Ronda Sanctimonious, Ronda Sanctus.
*04:38.380- 04:40.040* :  I don't even think Dessanctus is a word.
*04:40.040- 04:45.080* :  But he made a point of saying Ronda Santis is now someone that is on his side.
*04:45.420- 04:46.940* :  Of course he'll welcome it in his eyes.
*04:46.940- 04:47.960* :  That's one person down.
*04:48.220- 04:49.280* :  And another person to go.
*04:49.300- 04:53.920* :  So now his eyes are set on Nikki Haley, who he has a lot of nicknames for.
*04:54.260- 04:57.820* :  And we'll see when the primary happens and Tuesday what the results will be.
*04:57.820- 05:00.680* :  I should say that the poll show that he is still pretty far ahead.
*05:00.940- 05:02.820* :  But Nikki Haley and her supporters certainly,
*05:02.820- 05:04.240* :  I've been spending a lot of time talking to them.
*05:04.240- 05:07.560* :  I'm pretty confident that she has what it takes to win the nomination.
*05:08.660- 05:10.300* :  Nomi Ekbao in New Hampshire.
*05:10.940- 05:14.720* :  The war between Ukraine and Russia prompted by Moscow's invasion
*05:15.200- 05:17.380* :  saw two major developments on Sunday.
*05:18.020- 05:21.740* :  The first was a drone attack at a gas terminal outside St Petersburg,
*05:22.320- 05:23.580* :  which caused a huge fire.
*05:24.280- 05:28.740* :  And then an airstrike in the Russian occupied city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine,
*05:28.740- 05:32.680* :  which Russian officials say killed at least 27 people,
*05:33.200- 05:35.880* :  and wounded 25 in a market district.
*05:36.600- 05:40.020* :  This report from our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhardt.
*05:41.780- 05:43.800* :  The shelling in Russian controlled Donetsk,
*05:44.020- 05:47.420* :  hit an area in the southwest of the city, not far from the front line.
*05:48.080- 05:50.580* :  Graphic video footage from the Reuters news agency
*05:50.960- 05:53.640* :  shows many dead bodies lying on the snow-covered streets.
*05:54.200- 05:56.780* :  Valeriy Tsuchuk lost his wife in the shelling.
*05:58.540- 06:00.100* :  A woman called from my wife's phone.
*06:00.600- 06:01.280* :  I was at work.
*06:02.260- 06:04.520* :  She said, that's it, your wife's gone.
*06:05.340- 06:05.700* :  That's all.
*06:06.700- 06:09.780* :  She traded at the market right here next to the store.
*06:10.320- 06:12.120* :  She must have been walking past right here.
*06:12.780- 06:17.460* :  Based on the Russian casualty figures, it would appear to be the worst attack on a civilian area
*06:17.460- 06:21.040* :  in a Russian occupied part of Ukraine since the conflict began.
*06:21.720- 06:26.720* :  Donetsk city and parts of the wider region were first seized by Russian-backed fighters in 2014.
*06:26.860- 06:29.700* :  There have been under Moscow's control ever since.
*06:29.700- 06:34.860* :  The day had begun with a major fire caused by explosions overnight at a gas terminal
*06:35.160- 06:36.900* :  in the Russian port of Ust-Luga.
*06:37.380- 06:39.340* :  The Russian authorities say there were no casualties.
*06:40.160- 06:43.700* :  They have not confirmed that the plant, owned by the gas producer Novotek,
*06:43.700- 06:47.600* :  was targeted in a drone attack, but the district was put on high alert.
*06:48.480- 06:49.860* :  Ukrainian sources have claimed it was.
*06:49.860- 06:54.220* :  This would fit in with a pattern of key of increasingly targeting Russian infrastructure
*06:54.700- 06:58.340* :  in reprisal for sustained bombardment of its own critical utilities.
*06:59.420- 07:03.800* :  Only days ago, Russia claimed it had foiled a Ukrainian drone attack in the same region,
*07:04.180- 07:05.740* :  reportedly on an oil depot.
*07:06.020- 07:10.580* :  It was the first time that Ukraine is believed to have targeted an area that far north in this way.
*07:11.060- 07:12.700* :  The developments will worry Moscow.
*07:13.220- 07:16.060* :  The port of Ust-Luga is strategically significant.
*07:16.060- 07:19.800* :  It's the biggest port by tonnage of cargo in the whole Baltic area.
*07:20.340- 07:23.300* :  Ukraine claims that the hit won't just damage Russia's economy.
*07:23.300- 07:26.220* :  It will also hurt fuel supplies for its war efforts.
*07:26.780- 07:27.920* :  Danyabahad reporting.
*07:28.680- 07:31.860* :  The Hamas-run government of Gaza says the Israeli offensive
*07:32.360- 07:35.760* :  has now claimed more than 25,000 lives in the strip,
*07:36.400- 07:39.600* :  since the groups deadly assault against Israel in October.
*07:40.600- 07:42.980* :  Meanwhile, in its first public account of the attack,
*07:42.980- 07:47.600* :  Hamas said it was a necessary step against Israeli occupation,
*07:48.160- 07:52.240* :  but that some mistakes occurred due to the chaos that followed what it called
*07:52.580- 07:55.180* :  the rapid collapse of Israel's security system.
*07:55.900- 08:00.920* :  130 Israeli and other hostages taken by Hamas are still being held in Gaza.
*08:01.500- 08:04.340* :  Our correspondent, Margloin, reports from Jerusalem.
*08:04.880- 08:08.440* :  In Gaza, tallies of the dead are out of date by the hour.
*08:08.440- 08:14.280* :  The latest milestone of more than 25,000 killed according to the Hamas-run health ministry
*08:14.700- 08:17.520* :  comes as Israeli forces focus on southern Gaza,
*08:17.520- 08:22.540* :  where their convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up around the city of Han Yunis.
*08:22.960- 08:26.340* :  That's where the Israeli defence forces say they discovered another tunnel,
*08:26.340- 08:31.620* :  830 meters long and booby trapped, which the IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari
*08:31.620- 08:36.040* :  said contained cells that they believe we used to keep Israeli hostages.
*08:38.620- 08:42.180* :  Each cell was enclosed by metal bars and had a toilet in the mattress.
*08:42.760- 08:47.000* :  According to testimonies we have, about 20 hostages were held in this tunnel
*08:47.380- 08:50.860* :  at different times, in difficult conditions, without daylight.
*08:51.520- 08:54.880* :  More than three months in, most Israelis still back the war,
*08:54.880- 08:57.960* :  but not their prime minister whose popularity is sinking.
*08:57.980- 09:03.740* :  There's anger from families of the hostages who say Benjamin Netanyahu must do more to get them back.
*09:04.380- 09:06.520* :  And there's also growing doubts over progress.
*09:07.180- 09:13.580* :  US intelligence is reported to have concluded that Israel has killed only 20-30% of Hamas fighters
*09:14.140- 09:17.800* :  and that the group has enough weapons to continue striking back for months,
*09:17.820- 09:23.000* :  raising the specter of a prolonged conflict with deepening trauma on both sides.
*09:23.760- 09:27.620* :  Mark Lohan reporting. Well, since the October the 7th attacks
*09:27.620- 09:31.340* :  and the start of the consequent Israeli offensive in Gaza,
*09:31.860- 09:35.000* :  more than 500 Israeli soldiers have been killed.
*09:35.600- 09:38.420* :  Military service is mostly compulsory in Israel.
*09:38.460- 09:43.440* :  But one young man who's refused the draft is 18-year-old Tal Midnick.
*09:43.820- 09:48.060* :  He's the first person to be sent to jail for refusing the call-up for Gaza.
*09:48.620- 09:51.040* :  He explained why to my colleague, Rebecca Kesby.
*09:51.360- 09:55.980* :  Came to the decision when I realized I cannot in good conscious take part
*09:56.480- 09:59.640* :  in the actions of the IDF against Palestinian people.
*09:59.640- 10:04.480* :  I could not take part in the occupation and I cannot take part in a body that believes
*10:04.480- 10:06.440* :  that violence is the way to solve problems.
*10:06.700- 10:13.720* :  Well, lots of people listening will say that those attacks by Hamas on October the 7th
*10:13.820- 10:18.540* :  were the biggest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust
*10:18.540- 10:22.740* :  and something had to be done to push back against that.
*10:23.000- 10:26.900* :  I believe that the attacks were horrible and totally unjustified
*10:26.900- 10:30.780* :  and everyone in Israel has lost someone that's close to them.
*10:31.040- 10:34.400* :  But with this grief, we can't let it turn into a feeling of revenge
*10:34.400- 10:37.480* :  and we can't let the army do what Hamas did to us.
*10:37.480- 10:39.200* :  We can't let more families grieve.
*10:39.400- 10:41.620* :  It's been pretty bad. I've been painted as a traitor,
*10:41.620- 10:47.720* :  but I believe my opinions are legitimate and when we start to actually go for peace
*10:48.100- 10:51.040* :  and when the country will actually start to humanize Palestinians,
*10:51.040- 10:52.600* :  that's what will bring us security.
*10:53.240- 10:59.000* :  I'm sure there are people listening to you have a lot of sympathy with your point of view,
*10:59.000- 11:04.780* :  but others might say it sounds a little bit naive if I can just say that saying you want everyone
*11:04.780- 11:09.320* :  to live because people have already died and there are some that are saying the very
*11:09.320- 11:13.840* :  existence of Israel could be at stake and they're trying to defend the country.
*11:14.100- 11:17.440* :  I think it's naive to think that violence will solve anything.
*11:17.440- 11:19.900* :  All the violence that we've seen in these 70 years
*11:20.460- 11:23.780* :  hasn't solved anything and it doesn't look like we're changing any policy.
*11:23.780- 11:28.620* :  We need to change and the only change that we can see is a change for non-violence.
*11:28.880- 11:31.720* :  More violence and more bloodshed isn't going to solve anything.
*11:31.840- 11:33.600* :  What is the way forward as you see it?
*11:33.640- 11:37.420* :  We need to free all the hostages, bring back all the political prisoners,
*11:37.420- 11:41.760* :  get to a ceasefire and start talk about a long lasting solution.
*11:42.080- 11:48.020* :  You do face another draft army summons next week, I think.
*11:48.580- 11:50.320* :  What are you going to do then?
*11:50.820- 11:54.200* :  I have a draft order on Monday and I will refuse service once again.
*11:54.420- 11:56.240* :  All my heart knows that it's the right decision.
*11:56.700- 12:02.020* :  Concientious objectors have been remembered as the people who got the countries out of war,
*12:02.020- 12:04.740* :  if it's in Vietnam or in Israel with the Lebanon war.
*12:04.860- 12:09.560* :  I feel like with the time people will see my decision as the right one and I will not change it.
*12:09.700- 12:12.340* :  I'm fighting so that no one has to risk their life.
*12:12.420- 12:15.460* :  I think that these people risking their lives are the government
*12:15.460- 12:17.560* :  sending them off to die for nothing.
*12:17.560- 12:22.100* :  This won't bring us any security and we're seeing this with more and more soldiers dying
*12:22.100- 12:24.320* :  every day and more and more civilians dying every day.
*12:24.540- 12:28.140* :  Thomas isn't getting any weaker and the hostages aren't coming back.
*12:28.140- 12:30.760* :  So what is the point of this war besides of revenge?
*12:30.820- 12:32.700* :  I don't know if there's anything they could change from our.
*12:32.960- 12:35.640* :  Tal Mitnik speaking to Rebecca Kespie.
*12:36.180- 12:41.000* :  Across Germany, Sunday was another day of big demonstrations against the far right
*12:41.400- 12:43.820* :  and particularly the right-wing AFD party.
*12:44.760- 12:48.820* :  Official figures say more than one million protesters took part over the weekend
*12:48.820- 12:53.880* :  in almost a hundred cities, mainly motivated by reports that the AFD
*12:53.880- 12:59.560* :  were discussing a policy of mass deportation of citizens of foreign origin or heritage.
*13:00.340- 13:03.380* :  These demonstrators in Cologne explained why they were there.
*13:06.560- 13:09.760* :  I'm demonstrating against the fact that the things that we all learned at school
*13:09.760- 13:12.320* :  that we all know can still seem to repeat themselves.
*13:13.260- 13:17.940* :  And I'm here to show that the silent majority is no longer silent because we are the majority.
*13:18.180- 13:25.200* :  And I think our democracy is a stable democracy and it must never, never be attacked in the way
*13:25.200- 13:28.040* :  the AFD is currently attacking it.
*13:28.760- 13:32.400* :  In Munich, the numbers gathering were so large that the demo had to be called off
*13:32.760- 13:33.940* :  for fear of overcrowding.
*13:33.940- 13:38.320* :  In Berlin, a hundred thousand people rallied from the German capital.
*13:38.820- 13:40.960* :  Here's our correspondent, Damian McGuinness.
*13:42.220- 13:49.120* :  This large protest outside the Reichstag building in Berlin is just the latest in a wave
*13:49.120- 13:51.560* :  of demonstrations that have swept the country.
*13:51.560- 13:58.200* :  It was all sparked by reports last week of a secret meeting in November in which far right
*13:58.200- 14:00.800* :  activists, including some members of the AFD,
*14:01.560- 14:06.520* :  discussed a plan to deport millions of people with non-German backgrounds.
*14:07.340- 14:11.560* :  This plan has sparked outrage in Germany and brought people to the streets,
*14:11.560- 14:13.640* :  hundreds of thousands almost every day.
*14:13.640- 14:18.680* :  And it's also sparked a debate about whether to ban the AFD party.
*14:18.700- 14:20.120* :  It's really gaining traction.
*14:20.740- 14:25.640* :  On the one hand, some people say it should happen because there are some elements within the AFD
*14:25.940- 14:27.920* :  who are clearly anti-democratic.
*14:28.300- 14:30.220* :  Others say it would be difficult to do.
*14:30.220- 14:31.520* :  There are high legal hurdles.
*14:31.520- 14:37.340* :  And it would also play into the AFD's narrative of being victimised by mainstream society.
*14:37.820- 14:42.180* :  I think what we're seeing here is how polarised German society is.
*14:43.680- 14:45.820* :  Our Berlin correspondent, Damian McGuinness.
*14:46.580- 14:49.280* :  The president of World Football's governing body, FIFA,
*14:49.820- 14:54.900* :  has called for teams whose fans commit racist abuse to forfeit their games automatically.
*14:55.780- 14:58.780* :  Johnny in Tantino was responding to incidents on Saturday
*14:58.780- 15:03.080* :  at Sheffield Wednesday in England and at Udinese in Italy,
*15:03.620- 15:07.160* :  where AC Milan players briefly walked off the pitch in protest.
*15:07.160- 15:10.000* :  Here's our Sports News correspondent, Patrick Geary.
*15:10.320- 15:13.040* :  Two incidents in two matches in two different countries
*15:13.040- 15:16.440* :  have highlighted the continuing problem of racism in football.
*15:16.860- 15:19.700* :  Now the man in charge of the global game has called for changes
*15:19.700- 15:23.780* :  that would cost teams points if their fans commit racist acts.
*15:24.340- 15:27.920* :  FIFA president Gianni in Tantino posted on ex-formally Twitter,
*15:28.440- 15:32.880* :  we have to implement an automatic forfeit for the team whose fans have committed racism
*15:33.240- 15:36.900* :  and caused the match to be abandoned, as well as worldwide stadium bans
*15:37.180- 15:39.220* :  and criminal charges for racists.
*15:40.000- 15:42.940* :  Yesterday, Coventry City's Casey Palmer told the referee
*15:42.940- 15:45.560* :  in his side's championship game against Sheffield Wednesday
*15:45.560- 15:48.660* :  that he'd been subjected to racist abuse from the crowd.
*15:48.660- 15:53.760* :  The game was stopped temporarily and South Yorkshire police are now investigating the incident.
*15:53.760- 15:59.480* :  Meanwhile, in Udinese in Italy, the AC Milan goalkeeper was racially abused by Udinese fans.
*15:59.480- 16:04.860* :  After speaking to the referee, Mike Manion and his teammates walked off the field for 10 minutes.
*16:04.860- 16:08.780* :  The France International says it wasn't the first time it had happened to him.
*16:10.180- 16:13.380* :  This thing of racism cannot be allowed to reach this level
*16:13.800- 16:16.320* :  and with all the cameras that are there, everything that's there
*16:16.600- 16:18.440* :  and the sanctions that are there for these things,
*16:18.440- 16:21.040* :  something must be done to change things.
*16:21.520- 16:25.940* :  Kick it out as being campaigning against racism in English football for more than 30 years.
*16:25.940- 16:32.200* :  Troy Townsend from the organisation says he wants Infantino to provide more details about his idea.
*16:32.720- 16:39.380* :  I hope that what he does then is to provide the further information behind what he means by forfeit.
*16:39.660- 16:43.420* :  We've been as an organisation an advocate of walking off the field of play from the players
*16:43.420- 16:47.480* :  and an advocate of deducting points or else we're just going to be going around in circles
*16:47.480- 16:49.860* :  with the same conversation time and time again.
*16:50.100- 16:53.600* :  The hunt is now on for those who racially abuse Palmer and Manion
*16:53.600- 16:57.300* :  but despite the presence of cameras and the potential of consequences,
*16:57.860- 16:59.720* :  this is a problem that's not going away.
*17:00.460- 17:01.720* :  Patrick Geary reporting
*17:05.060- 17:06.880* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:06.880- 17:09.880* :  It's important that we don't write to get awards.
*17:09.880- 17:15.440* :  That said, it's a stamp of approval and when you come to something at a T.S. Eliot prize,
*17:15.940- 17:17.980* :  we're not just talking about any award, are we?
*17:18.620- 17:21.980* :  We hear from the winner of one of Poetry's most prestigious prizes.
*17:30.000- 17:33.200* :  The White House says it's taking an attack on an airbase in Iraq
*17:33.760- 17:36.980* :  shared by US and Iraqi forces extremely seriously.
*17:37.760- 17:43.240* :  Washington blames Iran-backed militias for the assault on the Assad base late on Saturday.
*17:43.960- 17:47.860* :  The White House deputy national security advisor is John Feiner.
*17:48.600- 17:52.380* :  It was a very serious attack using ballistic missiles that pose a genuine threat
*17:52.820- 17:54.640* :  through the skill of US forces.
*17:54.940- 17:58.920* :  Many, if not most of those missiles, were shot down before they impacted the base
*17:58.920- 18:02.560* :  but some of them got through and the United States has demonstrated in the past
*18:02.600- 18:06.060* :  when these attacks have taken place in Iraq and Syria that we are going to respond
*18:06.060- 18:07.880* :  and to hold these groups accountable.
*18:08.660- 18:11.100* :  Elsewhere in the Middle East, in a village in southern Lebanon,
*18:11.100- 18:13.500* :  a drone strike believed to have been Israeli
*18:13.960- 18:16.060* :  and said to have killed two Hezbollah fighters.
*18:16.140- 18:22.400* :  For more on these attacks, I spoke to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega in Beirut.
*18:22.800- 18:27.940* :  What we know from the US military is that this base that's being used by US forces
*18:28.300- 18:31.720* :  in Iraq was hit by ballistic missiles also by rockets.
*18:32.560- 18:38.060* :  One Iraqi serviceman was injured, a number of American personnel are now
*18:38.060- 18:41.540* :  being evaluated for any possible brain injuries.
*18:41.540- 18:46.860* :  The Americans are saying that this attack was carried out by Iranian-backed militants
*18:46.860- 18:52.280* :  from inside Iraq and we've been talking about attacks that have been carried out by
*18:52.280- 18:58.520* :  groups supported by Iran, trained and armed by Iran all across the region and Iraq has become
*18:58.940- 19:04.520* :  another place where tensions have been high and it really shows how this conflict that's
*19:04.520- 19:07.260* :  happening in Gaza is spreading across the region.
*19:07.800- 19:10.600* :  What's the latest indeed following the apparent Israeli attack,
*19:10.600- 19:12.420* :  earlier in South Lebanon?
*19:12.840- 19:16.020* :  One of the main concerns has been the situation along the Lebanon,
*19:16.520- 19:21.280* :  Israel border and these almost daily cross-border attacks between Hezbollah,
*19:21.280- 19:26.420* :  which is another group that is supported by Iran and the Israeli military.
*19:26.540- 19:32.060* :  And Hezbollah confirmed today that one fighter was killed in what has been described as an
*19:32.060- 19:37.020* :  Israeli drone attack and again I think we've seen the impact that these attacks have had
*19:37.040- 19:40.900* :  80,000 people have been evacuated from communities in northern Israel.
*19:40.900- 19:47.620* :  Similar number of people have left their villages in southern Lebanon and there are fears that
*19:47.620- 19:51.940* :  this could lead to a major confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel.
*19:52.320- 19:57.300* :  The possibility of something very similar that we saw in 2006 when there was a major war
*19:57.300- 19:58.620* :  between Hezbollah and Israel.
*19:59.060- 20:03.520* :  All those different groups behind those attacks, Hezbollah here in Lebanon,
*20:03.520- 20:05.580* :  militias in Iraq also in Syria.
*20:05.580- 20:09.960* :  The Houthis in Yemen who've been attacking commercial vessels in the right sea
*20:10.320- 20:15.740* :  are supported by Iran and part of what Iran describes as the axis of resistance.
*20:15.740- 20:16.980* :  They are trained by Iran.
*20:16.980- 20:21.160* :  They are armed by Iran and they say that this is how they are responding to
*20:21.160- 20:26.540* :  Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis, Hezbollah say that these
*20:26.540- 20:33.420* :  attacks are going to continue until there is ceasefire in Gaza or the war in Gaza and
*20:33.860- 20:35.420* :  Hugo Bachega in Beirut.
*20:36.040- 20:41.160* :  For hundreds of millions of Hindus when India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi opens a new
*20:41.160- 20:47.020* :  temple this week for one of the faith's most revered deities, it will be a dream come true.
*20:47.880- 20:53.660* :  However, for many millions of Muslims it will be a painful reminder of a grim episode
*20:53.660- 20:59.980* :  in India's recent past because that temple was once a mosque which was illegally torn down,
*21:00.540- 21:03.180* :  triggering religious violence across the country.
*21:04.040- 21:10.120* :  Our South Asia correspondent Yoghita Limayye has traveled to Ayodhya, the site of the new temple.
*21:10.780- 21:11.680* :  She sent this report.
*21:15.420- 21:21.020* :  He, Lord Ram, a young group of Hindus shout near the site where a grand temple is being
*21:21.020- 21:27.660* :  opened for one of Hinduism's biggest deities, Lord Ram, at the spot where they believe he was born.
*21:29.460- 21:33.580* :  This is for Hindus, one of their most holy places.
*21:34.540- 21:36.880* :  Resulting the is a 20-year-old student.
*21:37.040- 21:40.560* :  Coming year will be the very biggest achievement of my life.
*21:40.800- 21:44.460* :  It is so exciting that God is coming back to his place.
*21:45.060- 21:50.480* :  The Prime Minister's presence turns a religious ceremony into a state event many say,
*21:51.020- 21:54.620* :  especially controversial because of the dark history of the site.
*21:54.680- 21:56.660* :  Some young men got into the mosque itself.
*21:57.000- 22:00.760* :  He raised the staff from the flag and he started destroying the structure.
*22:01.440- 22:05.040* :  Until 1992, a 16th century mosque stood there.
*22:05.380- 22:10.960* :  Many Hindus believe it was built by a Muslim ruler over the temple at the birthplace of Ma'am.
*22:11.180- 22:16.580* :  The mosque was illegally destroyed by tens of thousands of Hindu men,
*22:16.580- 22:21.260* :  climbing on its domes, wielding hammers, swords and tridents.
*22:23.600- 22:28.800* :  I have now come to meet one of the men who says he was a part of those mobs.
*22:28.960- 22:34.400* :  Santosh Dubi, in India, he is called a Karseva, called a religious worker.
*22:37.280- 22:38.560* :  I feel proud and happy.
*22:38.560- 22:40.540* :  It was the best thing I have done.
*22:40.540- 22:43.980* :  It was religious work and I was put on earth to do it.
*22:44.160- 22:45.040* :  I have no regrets.
*22:45.800- 22:50.300* :  Santosh and dozens of others spend time in jail but they were not convicted.
*22:50.920- 22:54.800* :  In the violence that broke out following the demolition of the mosque,
*22:54.800- 22:58.980* :  thousands of people were killed all over India, most of them Muslims.
*22:59.060- 23:04.680* :  And I have come now to a mosque to meet the son of one man who was killed in the violence.
*23:04.700- 23:10.020* :  I am going to speak to Mohammad Shahed to find out what happened to his father.
*23:11.660- 23:15.760* :  First he was beaten and then they poured oil on him and set him on fire.
*23:15.820- 23:19.900* :  The country wants to forget it but Muslims can never forget.
*23:20.260- 23:23.220* :  We will be treated then and that's why we are fearful now.
*23:23.620- 23:28.880* :  So many outsiders will come again and it's when outsiders come to Ayodhya, the trouble starts.
*23:30.380- 23:35.700* :  The member of parliament from Ayodhya belongs to the Bharatiya Janita party or the BJP,
*23:35.700- 23:38.280* :  which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party.
*23:38.560- 23:39.620* :  His name is La Lus Singh.
*23:39.620- 23:42.920* :  I've come to his office just to offer busy street in Ayodhya.
*23:43.540- 23:49.940* :  I've come here to ask Mr Singh how appropriate it is for the Prime Minister of a secular country
*23:49.940- 23:53.620* :  to be opening such a major Hindu religious event.
*23:55.300- 23:58.720* :  It's 100% right. This must happen.
*23:58.720- 24:02.700* :  The culture of the majority community in the country dominates the nation.
*24:03.060- 24:05.360* :  This does not mean we do not respect minorities.
*24:05.360- 24:11.220* :  If the Prime Minister is Hindu, why should he not visit the biggest center of the Hindu faith?
*24:12.700- 24:16.920* :  The events that have occurred in this city in Ayodhya, they've shaped Indian politics.
*24:17.320- 24:21.840* :  All major political parties have sought to appease voters over the issue.
*24:22.480- 24:26.520* :  But for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP, it's support of the temple,
*24:26.780- 24:29.540* :  as part of its aggressive assertion of Hinduism,
*24:29.540- 24:34.700* :  has been the reason that it's transformed from being just a small party a few decades ago
*24:34.700- 24:40.120* :  to being seen as virtually undefeatable now and indeed the inauguration of the temple
*24:40.120- 24:46.020* :  is the reason why many believe it will sweep elections that will be held later this year.
*24:46.360- 24:48.840* :  But with it being carried out by the Prime Minister,
*24:49.260- 24:54.240* :  many are also asking what that means for the future of a secular India.
*24:55.100- 24:59.980* :  Yogi Tehli Maye reporting from Ayodhya in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state.
*25:01.420- 25:08.280* :  Last week, Jason Allen Pezon won the TS Eliot prize, one of Poetry's biggest for his work,
*25:08.280- 25:13.340* :  Self Portrait S. Othello. Jason's story in itself is quite a tale.
*25:13.960- 25:18.560* :  He was born into poverty in Jamaica, to a mother who was studying to be a teacher and a father
*25:18.560- 25:23.160* :  who left before he was born. He lived with his grandparents, Yam farmers,
*25:23.540- 25:27.780* :  during his early years, and learned to read from a blackboard on their veranda.
*25:28.660- 25:31.360* :  Having completed a degree at the University of the West Indies,
*25:31.880- 25:35.580* :  Jason's education has taken him to Montreal, Paris and Oxford.
*25:36.460- 25:40.540* :  He spoke to Johnny Diamond about his work and winning such a prestigious prize.
*25:41.400- 25:43.920* :  And it's important that we don't write to get awards.
*25:44.400- 25:49.900* :  That said, awards affect the course of a career.
*25:50.120- 25:51.460* :  It's a stamp of approval.
*25:51.460- 25:54.720* :  And when you come to something at a TS Eliot prize,
*25:54.720- 25:57.280* :  we're not just talking about any work, are we?
*25:57.640- 26:01.680* :  You write of your time in Paris at the Ecole, not mouth superior.
*26:02.180- 26:03.920* :  I will always be a stranger here.
*26:04.380- 26:06.680* :  Is that in Paris? Is it Europe?
*26:07.080- 26:09.200* :  Is it your existence in general?
*26:09.760- 26:12.680* :  That here is very much Paris.
*26:13.780- 26:19.080* :  I'm going to Paris at last, Mama's grandson, and I cannot sleep tonight.
*26:19.180- 26:25.620* :  Will I learn to speak here at home of loss and forsaking the vanishes?
*26:25.740- 26:30.560* :  But I suppose these situations evoke a broader context as well.
*26:31.000- 26:35.820* :  I had just done my first year at Merchant College, Oxford as well.
*26:36.220- 26:41.160* :  And I was on an Odyssey that I was thrilled about.
*26:41.160- 26:48.040* :  And I suppose I was asking those questions around your belonging to a particular place
*26:48.380- 26:51.740* :  and the sort of awkwardness that you get when you come from a poor,
*26:51.740- 26:53.880* :  bad girl coming into these spaces.
*26:54.660- 26:57.360* :  One of the black men in the room speaks my language.
*26:58.080- 27:03.840* :  The language of performer and wow, did they like it?
*27:03.980- 27:10.660* :  The looks are trying to find whiteness in my blackness.
*27:11.620- 27:14.840* :  Come on, Bredry, my Jamaican brother says to me,
*27:15.940- 27:18.560* :  black people don't go opera, you know this.
*27:19.100- 27:21.180* :  And I should stress that you're having a lot of fun.
*27:21.380- 27:27.940* :  As I think the book shows, it's somebody who comes wide-eyed to a completely new world
*27:27.940- 27:31.220* :  and who dives into the experience.
*27:31.500- 27:37.900* :  It's that world of cocktail parties and tweed jackets and black tie dinners
*27:38.180- 27:41.180* :  and going to the theater and the opera and what of you.
*27:41.400- 27:44.140* :  He's enjoying it, but he's also watching himself doing it
*27:44.360- 27:48.640* :  because you need to sort of like convince yourself that you belong there.
*27:48.700- 27:49.880* :  It's a performance.
*27:50.020- 27:54.680* :  I've come a long way on my journey living in Europe as a Jamaican
*27:54.700- 27:55.800* :  who has come to this space.
*27:56.460- 27:57.680* :  There have been a lot of great things.
*27:57.720- 28:02.060* :  I am now an associate professor at a Russell Group University.
*28:02.060- 28:06.340* :  What I'm saying, Johnny, is that I've changed class and I'm aware of it.
*28:06.760- 28:08.820* :  I'm no longer a stranger to Europe.
*28:09.220- 28:11.240* :  You've recently become a father.
*28:11.480- 28:15.460* :  I wonder about the world which you have brought a child into,
*28:15.780- 28:17.400* :  in particular the country you've brought one into.
*28:17.400- 28:19.560* :  Do you think it is a more welcoming place?
*28:20.440- 28:23.480* :  No, Johnny, sadly I don't think it's a more welcoming place.
*28:24.000- 28:27.320* :  We have a term that's been going about ever since I came to this country,
*28:27.320- 28:28.700* :  which is hostile environment.
*28:29.180- 28:32.680* :  As far as immigration policies go,
*28:33.160- 28:35.000* :  I think things have gotten harsher.
*28:35.000- 28:39.600* :  One might say, okay, somebody like myself can win a prize in 2023.
*28:40.420- 28:42.520* :  So there I would say there have been advances.
*28:43.320- 28:48.740* :  I think one of the weird things that happens is that you make a step forward
*28:49.280- 28:50.300* :  and there is pushback.
*28:50.740- 28:56.220* :  It's a game of constantly proving that you are just as good
*28:56.600- 29:00.780* :  as the other guy, always by doing far more in my experience.
*29:01.380- 29:04.420* :  You are speaking to us from Ethiopia,
*29:04.420- 29:09.780* :  where you went to go and meet your father for the first time and I understand
*29:09.780- 29:11.980* :  you have just met him.
*29:12.480- 29:14.780* :  Can you share with us what that was like?
*29:15.280- 29:18.280* :  I had a warm meeting with my father.
*29:18.620- 29:20.140* :  It was the very first time ever.
*29:20.520- 29:25.440* :  I felt fortunate to be able to meet him, to meet his wife, his children.
*29:25.900- 29:26.800* :  And I'm still processing.
*29:26.860- 29:28.220* :  It's a lot to take in.
*29:28.540- 29:31.220* :  I suppose I can't say very much more at the moment.
*29:31.560- 29:35.240* :  Without wanting to interrupt that process of understanding,
*29:35.240- 29:38.820* :  do you think you will in the end write about this?
*29:38.960- 29:41.000* :  I am already writing about it.
*29:41.540- 29:44.500* :  Jason Allen Pesson, speaking to Johnny Diamond.
*29:45.420- 29:49.600* :  For many people here in the UK who watched the last night of the proms,
*29:49.600- 29:53.180* :  the annual series of mainly classical music concerts in London,
*29:53.780- 29:57.540* :  the singing of Rule Britannia is an essential part of the evening.
*29:58.360- 30:01.960* :  But critics of the 18th century song believe it's antiquated
*30:02.380- 30:06.840* :  because of its associations with colonialism, slavery, and the British Empire.
*30:07.720- 30:11.340* :  Sheku Kanemason, the British cellist who found international fame
*30:11.340- 30:14.520* :  when he performed at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle,
*30:14.920- 30:17.900* :  had told the BBC that Rule Britannia shouldn't be performed
*30:17.900- 30:21.060* :  any more at the last night of the proms, nor Nanji reports.
*30:27.380- 30:31.280* :  There was fierce criticism in 2020 when it emerged that Rule Britannia
*30:31.280- 30:32.880* :  would not be sung at the proms.
*30:33.420- 30:37.740* :  The BBC had blamed the move on COVID-19 restrictions, but later backtracked.
*30:38.380- 30:42.220* :  Sheku Kanemason was a soloist at the last night of the proms last year.
*30:42.960- 30:46.060* :  But he said he did not state to hear Rule Britannia being sung.
*30:46.880- 30:49.500* :  He told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Disc,
*30:49.760- 30:51.980* :  the song made a lot of people feel uncomfortable
*30:52.380- 30:55.340* :  and suggested British folk music could replace it at the event.
*30:56.120- 30:59.760* :  The BBC said the last night festivities were one of the proms traditions
*30:59.760- 31:01.880* :  which were loved by people around the world.
*31:02.480- 31:05.240* :  Noananji, South Korea's exports of kimchi,
*31:05.240- 31:09.720* :  the fermented vegetable side dish, set a new record last year
*31:10.080- 31:12.580* :  amid the rising popularity of all things Korean,
*31:12.980- 31:16.400* :  they rose by 7% to 44,000 tonnes.
*31:16.900- 31:19.580* :  The mixture of salted cabbage with radish and carrots
*31:19.580- 31:22.440* :  already had a big fan base across East Asia.
*31:23.000- 31:24.880* :  But sales have also been on the up elsewhere.
*31:25.580- 31:27.680* :  So what's been the secret to kimchi's success?
*31:28.340- 31:29.480* :  Stephanie Prentice explains.
*31:29.480- 31:33.460* :  Probably visibility, so there are more Korean films,
*31:33.460- 31:37.440* :  TV dramas, bands and celebrities represented globally now
*31:37.440- 31:40.380* :  leading to a rise of interest in Korean culture.
*31:40.920- 31:46.360* :  On YouTube you can see videos of Kpop band BTS making kimchi with differing results.
*31:49.420- 31:51.860* :  5 years ago, Kim Chi-hee's program was called kimchi.
*31:52.880- 31:55.980* :  Those videos have hundreds of thousands of views each.
*31:55.980- 32:00.100* :  And the reach of kimchi is also easy to see in this latest data.
*32:00.560- 32:04.220* :  So traditionally, kimchi was exported to other East Asian countries
*32:04.220- 32:08.580* :  primarily, whereas today the US, the UK and the Netherlands
*32:08.580- 32:10.360* :  are in the top five buyers.
*32:10.360- 32:17.180* :  And in total, exports of kimchi came to around $150 million in 2023.
*32:17.260- 32:20.400* :  Now the Korean Ministry of Agriculture, they compiled the data.
*32:20.400- 32:24.660* :  They also said the exports were up more than 50% since 2050.
*32:24.700- 32:30.400* :  In a statement, it said this was mainly due to the increased popularity of K content.
*32:30.460- 32:34.700* :  Another big factor is that once Kim Chi got onto people's radars,
*32:34.960- 32:36.620* :  its health properties were noticed.
*32:36.620- 32:39.840* :  The fermented quality is said to improve gut health.
*32:40.120- 32:43.680* :  So it's also seen as riding the wellness and well-being wave as well.
*32:43.960- 32:48.100* :  I'm assuming this is part of a general rise in South Korean exports worldwide.
*32:48.460- 32:52.200* :  Yes, the Korean culture has been becoming more popular around the world for years.
*32:52.200- 32:56.180* :  Now many experts actually point to 2012's Gangnam style
*32:56.180- 32:59.340* :  as a big driver of what some are calling the Korean wave.
*32:59.340- 33:03.380* :  We've seen bands like BTS and BLACKPINK winning at American award shows
*33:03.380- 33:06.640* :  and selling out worldwide the success of Parasite,
*33:06.640- 33:08.820* :  the Korean film which got an Oscar in 2019.
*33:09.380- 33:12.300* :  That made people much more aware of the film industry there.
*33:12.640- 33:15.380* :  And of course, Squid Game, the TV series in 2021,
*33:15.860- 33:17.960* :  became one of Netflix's most popular shows.
*33:17.960- 33:21.580* :  And our past lives, the movie, is being tit for Oscar's success.
*33:22.120- 33:23.720* :  Our reporter, Stephanie Prentice.
*33:26.660- 33:31.040* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:31.600- 33:35.580* :  This edition was mixed by Matthew It and the producer was Emma Joseph.
