*01:13.920- 01:18.160* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 2nd of January, these are our main stories.
*01:18.160- 01:23.940* :  Israel's Supreme Court has annulled controversial judicial reforms that triggered months of protests
*01:23.940- 01:29.140* :  against Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Thousands of people in central Japan have spent the
*01:29.140- 01:35.240* :  night in evacuation centres following a powerful earthquake and a small tsunami. The Pope has condemned
*01:35.240- 01:39.660* :  the recent arrests of Roman Catholic priests and bishops in Nicaragua.
*01:40.120- 01:45.520* :  Also in this podcast, we take you to the Austrian mountains.
*02:00.480- 02:06.060* :  The Supreme Court in Israel has struck down judicial reforms that were a centrepiece of Benjamin
*02:06.060- 02:11.940* :  Netanyahu's agenda in government. The legislation limited the court's powers to overturn government
*02:11.940- 02:17.480* :  decisions that it judged to be unconstitutional. The reforms led to months of mass demonstrations
*02:17.480- 02:22.400* :  in Israel by opponents who said that they would prevent the proper oversight of the government.
*02:23.120- 02:27.340* :  One of the protest organizers described the court's decision as a victory in the battle
*02:27.340- 02:31.660* :  to protect democracy in the country. Paul Henley spoke to our correspondent,
*02:31.660- 02:37.820* :  Injurusulam Sharma Khalil, and asked her how much of a blow was this court judgment for the
*02:37.820- 02:40.920* :  Israeli Prime Minister, especially in the light of the current war in Gaza.
*02:41.360- 02:47.100* :  It's a significant blow because it yet again threatens to further undermine confidence in his
*02:47.100- 02:54.100* :  government. Remember, before the war, before October 7th, there was a huge showdown really between
*02:54.100- 03:00.280* :  the country's highest court, the Supreme Court, when the 15 judges in the first time in its
*03:00.280- 03:07.360* :  history decided to convene and make a decision on this judiciary overhaul that Netanyahu's
*03:07.360- 03:14.040* :  government had introduced and had suggested. So hundreds of thousands of Israelis take to the
*03:14.040- 03:19.740* :  streets against his government, calling for him to resign. And at the time, at the heart of all of
*03:19.740- 03:27.480* :  this was what is now known as the reasonableness bill. In July, the government pushed this reasonableness
*03:27.740- 03:34.660* :  bill. And essentially, what it is, it has curtailed or it has stopped the power of the Supreme
*03:34.660- 03:40.220* :  Court as well as lower courts in Israel to cancel government decisions deemed extremely unreasonable.
*03:40.220- 03:46.160* :  So essentially, it took away the power from the Supreme Court for a mechanic of checks and balances.
*03:46.160- 03:52.860* :  And at the time, it caused a great deal of division in Israel. The opponents of this decision by
*03:52.860- 03:58.120* :  the government said that it undermined democracy, it undermined the independence of the judiciary
*03:58.120- 04:04.260* :  and its ability to keep the government and those in power in check. But the supporters of
*04:04.720- 04:09.640* :  the Netanyahu government, which is the most right-wing government in Israel's history,
*04:10.360- 04:15.660* :  they essentially said that the court was intervening too much, that it had too much power to
*04:15.660- 04:22.280* :  stop decisions by elected officials, by the elected government. And so now we have a situation
*04:22.420- 04:29.080* :  where this Supreme Court has decided that it does have that power, that it has overturned the
*04:29.080- 04:34.640* :  government's decision. And now again, it's given itself, if you will, that power back to keep
*04:34.640- 04:40.720* :  the government in check. If Mr. Netanyahu is gone as Prime Minister once the war in Gaza is over,
*04:41.280- 04:47.900* :  other reforms gone too. The reforms have been passed and introduced by Mr. Netanyahu and his right
*04:47.900- 04:53.600* :  wing coalition. It depends on who comes to power. Is it going to be another right-wing coalition
*04:53.600- 04:59.080* :  of some sort? Is it going to be a completely different government and different ruling party?
*04:59.780- 05:04.480* :  But we're at a point right now where we're also waiting for what the Netanyahu government is
*05:04.480- 05:10.140* :  going to do. For example, the Justice Minister, who's seen essentially as the architect of these
*05:10.140- 05:15.400* :  reforms, has criticized the court saying that announcing this right now during the war is just
*05:15.400- 05:19.560* :  not in the spirit of unity for Israel. And so, of course, they're extremely unhappy.
*05:19.560- 05:23.100* :  They can't appeal it because this is a Supreme Court decision, but would they
*05:23.100- 05:29.060* :  can do zignor it? But if they do that, then that sends Israel internally into a constitutional crisis
*05:29.060- 05:35.160* :  at the time of war. Shamil Khalil. Thousands of doses of vaccines against
*05:35.160- 05:40.460* :  childhood diseases have been delivered to Gaza to help tackle a growing health emergency there.
*05:41.080- 05:45.620* :  As the conflict in the territory continues, Israel said on Friday that it would facilitate
*05:45.620- 05:49.420* :  the entry of the vaccines through RAFA to help prevent the spread of disease.
*05:50.220- 05:55.320* :  Germs are spreading quickly in overcrowded shelters where clean water is rare or unavailable.
*05:56.040- 06:01.000* :  And the Israeli military offensive has severely disrupted immunizations against polio and
*06:01.000- 06:07.020* :  measles amongst other diseases. Iadil Sapa Bekhov is the World Health Organization's head
*06:07.020- 06:11.160* :  of health emergency in Gaza. He says the situation is becoming critical.
*06:11.580- 06:17.860* :  Vaccine is the most effective public health tool for prevention of outbreaks of various
*06:17.860- 06:24.020* :  infectious diseases, especially among the vulnerable population as we have in Gaza right now,
*06:24.480- 06:31.600* :  where thousands of people live together in overcrowded camps with very poor water conditions,
*06:31.600- 06:38.020* :  poor hygiene and very poor sanitation. These are all breeding grounds for various diseases.
*06:38.280- 06:42.620* :  And some of those diseases could be quite deadly, especially for young children,
*06:42.620- 06:51.120* :  measles, polio, meningitis, hepatitis and others. We have not yet registered any outbreak
*06:51.120- 06:57.440* :  which is laboratory confirmed, but because the situation in Gaza is difficult and it's not
*06:57.440- 07:04.340* :  possible to laboratory confirm any disease that we may have. What we do as a WHO
*07:04.340- 07:09.900* :  we suggested the Ministry of Health and also our UNRO partners is to use so-called
*07:09.900- 07:16.680* :  syndromatic approach where you see the diseases and clinically detected before you do any laboratory
*07:16.680- 07:22.600* :  confirmation. Unfortunately, even if we do the laboratory confirmation, for us it's also very
*07:22.600- 07:28.220* :  difficult to control the outbreak of any disease that may have happened. So for the moment,
*07:28.280- 07:34.820* :  we have more than 180,000 cases of upper respiratory tract infections. We have around
*07:34.820- 07:40.860* :  more than 200 suspected cases of measles. Again, I repeat this is suspected cases because the
*07:40.860- 07:47.500* :  health system in Gaza is unable to currently confirm those cases, which is very bad also. We have
*07:47.500- 07:54.620* :  more than 200,000 cases of suspected area. And again, we don't know the origin of those diseases.
*07:55.200- 08:00.080* :  Iadil Sapa Bikov from the WHO who's currently in Rafa in southern Gaza.
*08:00.740- 08:05.500* :  Next to Japan and thousands of people have spent the night in evacuation centers following a
*08:05.500- 08:11.740* :  powerful earthquake, it measures 7.6 striking the center of the country and causing schools of
*08:11.740- 08:17.360* :  buildings to collapse and major damage to infrastructure. Four people are reported to have died and
*08:17.360- 08:22.660* :  there are fears others are trapped beneath rubble. But a warning that the earthquake could trigger a
*08:22.660- 08:28.000* :  devastated tsunami was later downgraded. Our former Asia correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes reports.
*08:31.160- 08:32.420* :  Wow, it's huge.
*08:36.460- 08:41.940* :  You can hear the shock in the voice of this foreign tourist as the earthquake begins shaking a
*08:41.940- 08:47.300* :  ski resort in the central mountains of Japan. The shaking is severe, triggering landslides
*08:47.660- 08:52.780* :  and bringing down buildings near the epicenter. This tourist from Taiwan, Johnny Wu, is staying at the
*08:52.780- 09:01.140* :  ski resort. Suddenly it gets pretty strong as you can see all the snow from the electric wire goes
*09:01.200- 09:08.780* :  down and also from the roof fell down and all the car is shaking. So everybody was panicked that
*09:08.940- 09:14.240* :  the shaking is followed by an even more frightening threat. Japan's meteorological agency
*09:14.240- 09:21.800* :  declares a tsunami may be heading for the coast. A large tsunami is being observed. The
*09:21.800- 09:27.080* :  official says people in coastal areas or along rivers are asked to evacuate to high ground
*09:27.080- 09:32.880* :  immediately. In Japan, this is everyone's worst nightmare. It immediately brings back memories
*09:32.880- 09:40.140* :  of what happened on March 11, 2011, when a huge 15 meter tsunami smashed into the northeast coast,
*09:40.660- 09:45.120* :  killing nearly 20,000 people and devastating the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
*09:46.060- 09:51.580* :  There are 10 hours as thousands flee their homes and seek shelter on higher ground. As night falls,
*09:51.580- 09:57.680* :  the tsunami warning is lowered. The big one has not materialized. But with aftershocks continuing
*09:57.680- 10:03.040* :  to strike, people are told not to return home. Many are now spending the night sheltering in cars
*10:03.040- 10:09.780* :  or in the open, with temperatures below zero. To Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer in the city of Yokohama,
*10:09.780- 10:14.020* :  it is all distressingly reminiscent of his experience in 2011.
*10:14.660- 10:20.400* :  The house that I was in, I could feel heavy shaking about two minutes long and I could tell even
*10:20.400- 10:25.260* :  though it wasn't near me that this was a big earthquake. It was the exact same experience I had in
*10:25.260- 10:30.740* :  Tokyo over 10 years ago. You just feel something is very long and you know that this has been a
*10:30.740- 10:35.960* :  terrible earthquake somewhere but not close. The threat of a tsunami has now passed but the damage
*10:35.960- 10:42.520* :  is severe. The not open insular that sticks out into the sea of Japan is cut off. Older houses have
*10:42.520- 10:47.920* :  been brought down roads torn up and unknown number of people are trapped under collapsed buildings.
*10:48.580- 10:54.940* :  Just how much damage has been done is still unclear. As in 2011, it could be some days before the
*10:54.940- 11:00.600* :  scale of the destruction can be fully assessed. Well for more on this latest earthquake in Japan,
*11:00.600- 11:05.780* :  we've been speaking to James Jackson who's a professor of active tectonics at the University of
*11:05.780- 11:11.060* :  Cambridge here in the UK. This was an earthquake quite large on the west coast of Japan so not in the
*11:11.060- 11:16.700* :  east coast, so it's a different geological situation from the one in 2011. The one in 2011,
*11:16.700- 11:21.880* :  it was to do with the Pacific sea floor sliding underneath Japan and that happens all the way
*11:21.880- 11:27.260* :  around the Pacific. The sea floor slides underneath the surrounding land rather like an escalator
*11:27.260- 11:31.640* :  which is the top of the staircase. It just slides back into the earth again and that's what happens
*11:31.640- 11:36.700* :  with the Pacific sea floor on the east side of Japan and that's what was responsible for the 2011
*11:36.700- 11:42.540* :  earthquake. This is on the other side on the west coast and it's a different business altogether.
*11:42.540- 11:47.700* :  It's quite shallow for a start. I don't get deeper earthquakes and it's about Japan actually
*11:47.700- 11:53.120* :  crumpling up so it's getting squashed. It does fell on the east coast there. This is not a surprise
*11:53.120- 11:58.780* :  in the sense that the last big one rather similar to this was in 1964 at Nigolasa which is just
*11:58.780- 12:03.780* :  about 100 kilometers long recosed from here. So people are used to this. I mean they've had in the
*12:03.780- 12:10.160* :  last 30, 40 years they've had six or seven not quite as big as this but they're certainly aware
*12:10.160- 12:14.760* :  that these things are frequent. I mean Japan is really admired and respected around the world for
*12:14.760- 12:21.360* :  being so good at preparing for these things, preparing the population, teaching children and
*12:21.360- 12:27.920* :  for the public what to do and how important it is and yes it's a tragedy that anyone's died and
*12:27.920- 12:32.160* :  there will be a lot of damage and it will cost a lot of money but it is a triumph that you can
*12:32.160- 12:36.820* :  have an earthquake this size and very few people are actually going to get killed. This
*12:36.820- 12:40.860* :  state put it in perspective. This is not much more than the earthquakes in South East Turkey and
*12:40.860- 12:46.180* :  Syria at the start of the year they killed 60,000 people and it's quite usual in the earthquake
*12:46.180- 12:50.680* :  belt between the Mediterranean and China. This goes right through the Middle East and the Far East
*12:51.060- 12:55.420* :  earthquakes of this size will routinely kill tens of thousands of people. That's just never going
*12:55.420- 13:02.080* :  to happen in Japan and that is tremendous and that is you know an enormous tribute to the integrity
*13:02.080- 13:06.680* :  of the building industry and everything else in Japan. They take these things extremely seriously.
*13:07.100- 13:12.700* :  James Jackson from the University of Cambridge. Austria's stunning Alpine Lake region,
*13:12.700- 13:18.100* :  the Salzkammergut, is one of Europe's cultural capitals this year. It is the first time a rural
*13:18.100- 13:23.720* :  Alpine region has been chosen instead of a city. Over the next 12 months towns and villages in the
*13:23.720- 13:29.620* :  area southeast of Salzburg will be hosting a range of cultural and artistic projects. The
*13:29.620- 13:35.320* :  region has a rich heritage in both folk and classical music as Bethany Bell discovered when she
*13:35.320- 13:53.320* :  visited the old imperial spa town of Bardicial. Music by the Austrian singer and songwriter
*13:53.320- 13:59.540* :  Hubert von Geisen, which will feature the opening ceremony of Salzkammergut 2024,
*14:00.220- 14:06.780* :  but with a difference. The artist who comes from this region told me he'll be joined by a choir
*14:06.780- 14:10.040* :  of a thousand voices and they'll be ugly.
*14:20.260- 14:27.320* :  I'm very excited when I think of it. I'm very nervous because we have no chance in really
*14:27.320- 14:35.320* :  rehearsing this and hopefully when I get together I can get them all synchronized. There'll be
*14:35.320- 14:43.540* :  some 300 on stage but the rest is 700. There'll be distributed within the audience. There'll be
*14:43.540- 14:54.920* :  also brass players from all those 23 villages which are involved in this thing. There'll be a very
*14:54.920- 15:03.760* :  genius percussionist and myself I will do some things nobody will expect.
*15:06.680- 15:12.680* :  I'm on the shores of Lake Town which is surrounded by craggy mountains covered in snow.
*15:13.720- 15:19.840* :  This is where Arnold Schoenberg used to spend his holidays. Maler, Brookner, Brahms and Schubert
*15:19.840- 15:26.220* :  were also very fond of this region. The organizers of the festival are hoping to reawake them some of
*15:26.220- 15:45.380* :  that created spirit. Peter Bruger, a pianist and head of the provincial music school in Bad
*15:45.380- 15:53.840* :  Geisen, plays Schoenberg on his glass grand piano. This summer the piano will be taken to the
*15:53.840- 15:59.940* :  nearby ice caves of the Dushstein mountains where works by young composers will be performed.
*16:00.060- 16:07.100* :  Peter Bruger says it's all about the future. We are looking for new Arnold Schoenbergs here. We want
*16:07.100- 16:14.240* :  to especially invite woman composers. We do not want to speak always about famous
*16:15.460- 16:21.000* :  artist meeting point of the 90th century. We have to create a new one.
*16:27.340- 16:34.240* :  Leo, one of Peter Bruger's students, improvises on his bass clarinet. He's writing a piece for one
*16:34.240- 16:40.560* :  of the composing competitions run by the South's Comma Good Cultural Capital. It will be an
*16:40.560- 16:47.300* :  Osarvo piece. It's based on the little prince. I'm looking forward to it because I think it's
*16:47.340- 16:50.300* :  a great opportunity for artists in South's Comma Good.
*16:56.960- 17:03.620* :  The opening will also feature a different sound. Cowbells worn by locals known as gluptlers
*17:03.620- 17:11.240* :  who parade around on the 5th of January to chase away winter. Stefan Pichler is a glitler from
*17:11.240- 17:19.820* :  the town of Lauffen. We walk through the to snow from village to village with bells
*17:20.320- 17:28.000* :  to evake the spring spirit, bringing freedom, peace and happiness.
*17:37.600- 17:43.080* :  That report was by Bethany Bell in Austria. Still to come.
*17:48.780- 17:51.980* :  Fancy being the owner of a cuckoo club museum? Find out later.

*19:22.940- 19:30.120* :  it was going to be pumped. Podcasts from the BBC World Service. Search for amazing sport stories,

*19:35.860- 19:41.320* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Next to Bangladesh, and as we heard in the earlier
*19:41.320- 19:47.200* :  podcast, he's a Nobel Prize winner and economist who spread the concept of small loan schemes
*19:47.220- 19:53.820* :  and is credited with lifting millions of people out of poverty. But Mohammed Yunus was sentenced
*19:53.820- 19:59.140* :  on Monday to six months in prison by a court in Dhaka. He was convicted of violating
*19:59.140- 20:04.500* :  labour laws by felying to provide a welfare fund for people working for him. He and three
*20:04.500- 20:10.220* :  others have been granted bail pending appeals. Addressing a crowd in the city, Mr Yunus said he was
*20:10.220- 20:16.460* :  innocent of any crime. I've been punished for a crime I did not commit. If you want to call
*20:16.460- 20:22.100* :  that justice you can, but this tragedy will remain. We've been hurt on this joyous day.
*20:23.040- 20:28.300* :  Paul Henley spoke to Irene Khan, a Bangladeshi national and supporter of Mohammed Yunus.
*20:28.740- 20:33.740* :  She is a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression and she was in court when the sentences
*20:34.040- 20:38.300* :  were given out. As I arrived at the building in which the court is located,
*20:38.300- 20:44.480* :  I could see a rings of policemen surrounding the building. We went up to the fourth floor.
*20:44.940- 20:48.900* :  The court room itself was packed. People were pouring out into the corridor.
*20:49.740- 20:55.300* :  There wasn't even standing room. When the judge entered the room, you could hear a pin drop.
*20:55.920- 21:02.280* :  People stood there listening to her, give a verdict in which a Nobel Peace Laureate,
*21:02.440- 21:07.900* :  the only Nobel Peace Laureate this country, Bangladesh has, was convicted to six months of
*21:07.900- 21:14.240* :  imprisonment together with three of his associates. Why do you call this a travesty of justice?
*21:14.760- 21:23.060* :  I call it a travesty of justice because Yunus, we were told by the judge, was not being prosecuted
*21:23.580- 21:28.900* :  for his Nobel Laureate status. He was not being prosecuted for his work as a social activist.
*21:28.900- 21:36.040* :  He was being prosecuted as chair of a telecom company in Bangladesh, but he is the only chair
*21:36.040- 21:42.480* :  of the telecom company who has been prosecuted in this manner that the company failed to set up a
*21:42.480- 21:49.080* :  welfare fund for its employees. Now, how many companies in Bangladesh could be prosecuted for
*21:49.080- 21:55.440* :  precisely those grounds and are not being prosecuted? But just to be clear, you're not denying that
*21:55.440- 22:02.440* :  this firm did break labor law and his firm did not create a worker's welfare fund. That's not in
*22:02.440- 22:07.560* :  dispute. It is disputed. It is heavily disputed by the defence. In the middle of the judgment,
*22:07.560- 22:13.480* :  his lawyers stood up and protested and disputed every single charge that was brought against him.
*22:13.480- 22:18.560* :  He himself has said that he has not committed these crimes. The case was rushed through.
*22:18.560- 22:23.620* :  There are procedural flaws as well as problems with substantive interpretation of the law,
*22:24.100- 22:29.860* :  and the defence continues to believe that they were not listened. A sufficient evidence was not
*22:29.860- 22:36.140* :  provided to find him guilty. Arunikhan, a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression.
*22:37.260- 22:42.500* :  Next to Nicaragua, over the last couple of weeks, at least 14 priests have been arrested
*22:42.500- 22:47.060* :  in a crackdown on the Roman Catholic Church. It is part of a growing row between the government
*22:47.060- 22:52.800* :  of Daniel Ortega and the Vatican. And during his new year address, Pope Francis called for dialogue
*22:52.800- 22:57.480* :  to overcome the difficulties. I heard more from our America's editor, Leonardo Rosha.
*22:58.060- 23:03.460* :  The timing is important because those arrests happened two days ago. The latest arrests.
*23:03.500- 23:08.680* :  And the Pope said he was following the situation with concern. He asked for prayers,
*23:08.700- 23:14.720* :  and interestingly, he called for dialogue to try to overcome that situation.
*23:14.960- 23:18.420* :  He's been quite outspoken in the past about what's been going on in Nicaragua.
*23:18.560- 23:25.120* :  Yeah, earlier in the year 2023, he compared the government of Daniel Ortega.
*23:25.380- 23:30.540* :  A former Marxist rebel who's been in power for nearly 17 years. He compared his government
*23:30.540- 23:36.020* :  what he was doing to the priests there and to other political activists to Nazi Germany.
*23:36.660- 23:42.820* :  And he also said that the only explanation for that is that Mr. Ortega was unstable.
*23:42.820- 23:47.560* :  That's what he said at the time. But now, critically, he's saying that we need dialogue to try
*23:47.560- 23:52.220* :  to solve the situation. As we're saying here, relations between the Catholic Church and Nicaragua
*23:52.220- 23:57.480* :  and the government, there have been pretty strained for a number of years now. Why this latest
*23:57.480- 24:02.920* :  round of arrests? Well, I believe that what's happened from the 20th of December, that's one
*24:02.920- 24:09.100* :  bishop that was arrested, is because he mentioned another bishop, a detained bishop, who became sort
*24:09.100- 24:16.060* :  of a martyr, a symbol of the movement in Nicaragua. He mentioned him in his end of year sermon.
*24:16.060- 24:20.720* :  So I believe the other people, the other priests who are arrested were for the same reason,
*24:20.720- 24:26.180* :  going to church before Christmas and saying prayers for Bishop Roland de Álvarez. He was sentenced
*24:26.220- 24:32.820* :  to 26 years in jail in February for treason. That was the accusation from the government.
*24:32.820- 24:37.240* :  And then he has become a sort of a symbol of resistance to the government there.
*24:37.480- 24:42.180* :  So this all goes back to six years ago when there were opposition protests on the streets about
*24:42.620- 24:47.720* :  changes to the country at the time. And the Catholic Church has got very involved. Is it quite
*24:47.720- 24:54.600* :  unusual to get so involved in politics in Latin America? Well, they were involved before.
*24:55.160- 25:03.100* :  They were left-wing priests and they were famously involved with the movement in supporting the
*25:03.100- 25:08.380* :  oppressed and supporting the poor. And it's not unusual for the Catholic Church to get involved.
*25:08.440- 25:16.140* :  What they did in 2018 was to basically give shelter to people who were being persecuted by the
*25:16.140- 25:21.040* :  police. And that didn't go down with the Nicaragua government. That didn't go down well with them.
*25:21.560- 25:26.980* :  Leonardo Rossa. The Czech president, Beto Rpavel, in his first new year address,
*25:26.980- 25:32.060* :  has called for his country to take steps towards adopting the European Union's single currency,
*25:32.060- 25:38.300* :  the euro. He said it was the logical future for a small open economy. The Czech Republic joined
*25:38.300- 25:46.100* :  the EU in 2004 with adoption of the euro as one condition, but successive governments have failed
*25:46.380- 25:52.420* :  to take the necessary steps. The first of January marked 25 years since the launch of the euro
*25:52.420- 26:02.180* :  currency in Europe. It's been the day of the euro, the new year's day that began a new
*26:02.180- 26:08.480* :  euro for the European Union. Celebrations at the new European Central Bank as 11 countries finally
*26:08.480- 26:14.520* :  pinned their destiny to a single currency. Well, the euro was first used as a digital currency
*26:14.520- 26:20.160* :  traded on global markets. And used by international traders, the coins and notes came along three
*26:20.160- 26:26.840* :  years later, completely replacing the individual currencies of 11 nations. It was farewell to the
*26:26.840- 26:33.700* :  Frank, the Lyra, the Dutchmark, and the Pesator. Jean-Claude Trichet at the time of the euro's launch
*26:33.720- 26:37.860* :  was running the Bank of France and was later the president of the European Central Bank.
*26:38.660- 26:43.060* :  Sam Fennick asked him what he makes of the euro's performance 25 years on.
*26:43.240- 26:49.980* :  It is obviously a formidable success because the, I would say, expectations were very poor.
*26:50.400- 26:58.200* :  You had in the UK, in the US, a very large number of economists absolutely convinced that it
*26:58.200- 27:04.760* :  would be a total failure. I was told, a hundred times, how would you make a credible currency
*27:04.760- 27:12.420* :  in merging the DM, the Gilder, the Frank, the Escudo, the Drakma, the Pesator, the Lyra,
*27:12.540- 27:20.820* :  you are much too ambitious and it cannot work. I understand back then 25 years ago when you went
*27:20.820- 27:26.000* :  to the United States, you had to explain to them what you were doing. They didn't know about the
*27:26.000- 27:34.120* :  euro. They were convinced that it was a pure fantasy. In my memory, I would say seven months before
*27:34.120- 27:42.920* :  the 1st January 99, they were very convinced by the articles, by the, their economists, by
*27:42.920- 27:49.140* :  a number of Nobel Prize, that it was more or less impossible to make and they realized that there
*27:49.140- 27:56.300* :  was a will of the European to go in this direction and they were very surprised, extremely surprised,
*27:56.300- 28:01.780* :  obviously. So when it actually happened, take us back to that day, how did you feel?
*28:02.180- 28:10.260* :  For us, it was a technical formidable challenge because from day one, we had to merge totally
*28:10.260- 28:18.480* :  our money markets. We have to prepare for the appropriate functioning of this extraordinary
*28:18.480- 28:27.560* :  endeavor. At the time, we were merging 11 currencies, it was considered quasi-impossible even to
*28:28.060- 28:33.460* :  succeed. Did you fear it would fail? We were not sure it would work. Of course, we had prepared
*28:33.460- 28:40.940* :  very carefully everything and I was personally convinced that we would make it. Why did the
*28:40.940- 28:48.680* :  European Union want a single currency? To be sure that you had a single market, a functioning
*28:48.680- 28:56.000* :  single market, you had on top of all what had been done, which was considerable with a single
*28:56.000- 29:03.740* :  act and so forth, but you had also to care for avoiding big changes in the value of the various
*29:03.740- 29:12.200* :  currencies. So if we want really a working single market, we have to emulate the US single market.
*29:12.200- 29:19.480* :  There is only one currency in the US and we have to accept that and do that. But there was also a
*29:19.720- 29:25.040* :  criticism, wasn't there, that actually it was dominated by Germany. It was effectively a German
*29:25.040- 29:30.420* :  currency for the rest of Europe. Well, the German did not think at the time. I don't
*29:30.420- 29:35.660* :  know that it would be a German currency for the rest of Europe. They considered they were losing
*29:35.660- 29:43.020* :  the DM. It was extremely difficult. I remember Chancellor Cole telling his interlocutor, including
*29:43.020- 29:50.560* :  me, that had he asked with a referendum, like the French, what was the position of the German
*29:50.560- 29:56.660* :  public? They would have said, no, no, we keep the DM. We don't want to trade the DM. It was
*29:57.100- 30:05.320* :  not that easy to realize that it was an appropriate way to continue to proceed to achieve the single
*30:05.320- 30:10.760* :  markets and to go forward. Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank.
*30:11.540- 30:17.420* :  Now, could you live with a constant ticking and a cacophony of chirping like this every hour?
*30:23.280- 30:29.000* :  Well, if the answer is yes, then you could be qualified to take over as the owner of Cuckoo Land.
*30:29.080- 30:35.340* :  It is a museum in Tably, in Cheshire, in northwest England and it's dedicated to the Cuckoo
*30:35.340- 30:44.080* :  Clock, 750 of them. The current owners, brothers Roman and Maz Piacarski, have no airs, but think
*30:44.080- 30:50.300* :  it's finally time to hand over their collection. Adam Fleming spoke to Roman and asked him where the
*30:50.300- 30:56.840* :  appeal to Cuckoo clocks came from. When I was a little children, my brother and I, in the family
*30:56.840- 31:03.000* :  home, there was always a Cuckoo Clock and we used to watch the old clockmaker from across the
*31:03.000- 31:09.780* :  road and come 15. I got an apprenticeship in Manchester and so do my brother and have clockmaking
*31:10.200- 31:15.620* :  and repairing and more of you and it was joined that period of time that we found the first
*31:16.020- 31:22.540* :  Cuckoo Clock, but unfortunately we found a really good one. We said, if they made that just what
*31:22.540- 31:30.220* :  did they make, I'm sure they said that. If now we go over 750 of them. So if I arrived at the museum,
*31:30.220- 31:34.580* :  which sadly I've not had the chance to go to yet, just paint a picture of what would await me.
*31:34.780- 31:43.140* :  We have some very, very large Cuckoo clocks. When I say large, you could get in them sort of thing.
*31:43.140- 31:48.520* :  What? You could get in them. Well, we have a few clocks like that, but these at Cuckoo clocks
*31:48.520- 31:55.600* :  came out of hunting lodges. The animals that are on them are life size. What, like a life size
*31:55.600- 32:02.680* :  bear, a deer, and a fox or a deer. What's your absolute favourite out of the 750?
*32:03.540- 32:10.980* :  Oh, I have a clock that's all front is carved out of one piece of wood. I chased it for two years
*32:11.680- 32:16.880* :  and the day I found it, I got into this clock fair half an hour before anybody else
*32:17.400- 32:22.960* :  and I saw it on display and I just went over to the guy that was telling it to a new
*32:23.400- 32:29.100* :  and I just said, look, there's 500 euros and that will meet for a meal later tonight and
*32:29.100- 32:34.700* :  we'll do a deal on the clock. He said, right, no problems, Roman. And then the National Museum
*32:34.700- 32:40.340* :  in Germany and everybody won't talk to me or my brother for two years because they do all
*32:40.340- 32:46.220* :  they said was you have our clock. If you can imagine on the top of the clock there are two
*32:46.620- 32:53.760* :  beautiful hairs sort of looking worried and down at the bottom on the foliage there is a fox
*32:53.760- 32:59.240* :  looking up at them but it's all one piece of wood that I'll front. Oh, so they sort of tell a
*32:59.240- 33:05.760* :  story as well. Oh, most definitely and we do have clocks that tell them a most wonderful story
*33:06.200- 33:13.680* :  because we've just received into the collection a clock that is absolutely fabulous. I don't know
*33:13.680- 33:18.260* :  if you've heard of Lord Kitchener. Of course, yeah, the famous poster with his point in finger.
*33:18.520- 33:25.360* :  Well, he had a cuckoo clock and he said to his Batman that if anything should happen to me
*33:25.940- 33:33.320* :  I know your daughter loves my clock, she must have it and they died in the 1916 and a ship in
*33:33.320- 33:39.700* :  North Scotland and it went to his daughter and it was stayed in that family until he brought
*33:39.700- 33:44.440* :  it towards the nest as if we'd like to look after it for them. He gave it to us in fact.
*33:45.120- 33:51.380* :  Why is it time, if you pardon the pun, to hand the collection over? I'm turned 70. My brother's
*33:52.080- 33:59.580* :  69, I've had MS for 46 years. I think it's about time I started to take it easy.
*34:00.260- 34:02.680* :  Cuckoo clock collector, Mars Piacarsky.
*34:05.180- 34:08.400* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News
*34:08.400- 34:12.740* :  Podcast later on. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,

*34:30.320- 34:30.540* :  goodbye.
*34:39.180- 34:43.000* :  They want you to change your name. Archie reached off the carpet. Anything come to mind?
*34:43.120- 34:46.420* :  Carrie Grant. He was Hollywood's greatest leading man.
*34:46.620- 34:50.480* :  That Carrie Grant is a character. Be very careful about how he's perceived.
*34:50.840- 34:55.220* :  Yet few truly knew him. I have loved a lot of people and everyone's broken my heart.
*34:55.380- 34:56.960* :  I'll never let you go, aren't you?
*34:57.120- 35:00.480* :  Based on the remarkable true story. You know what's wrong with you?
*35:00.800- 35:01.360* :  No one.
*35:01.820- 35:02.100* :  Nothing.
*35:02.360- 35:06.660* :  Jason Isaacs is Archie. The man who became Carrie Grant,
