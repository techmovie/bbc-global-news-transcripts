*01:19.340- 01:22.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.900- 01:29.780* :  I'm Robin Brandt in the early hours of Thursday, the 18th of January, and these are our main stories.
*01:30.440- 01:35.660* :  The Houthis say they will continue their attacks on ships in the Red Sea after the United States
*01:35.680- 01:40.080* :  announced that it would return the group to its list of global terrorist organizations.
*01:41.000- 01:46.960* :  MPs in London have backed a plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda after the country's president
*01:46.960- 01:51.180* :  Paul Kagami expressed frustration with how long the process was taking.
*01:54.200- 01:59.100* :  Also in this podcast, we'll go to the other place in Israel's conflict with the Palestinians
*01:59.100- 02:04.980* :  and here from our correspondence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is suffering from a spike in
*02:04.980- 02:09.760* :  violence. And later, the top footballer who went to Saudi Arabia just a few months ago,
*02:10.220- 02:15.300* :  but has now decided it's too hot for him. He found it difficult to adjust in the conditions
*02:15.380- 02:19.520* :  of the Saudi climate because it's not easy to play in those high temperatures.
*02:24.220- 02:28.620* :  We start there with the deepening standoff between the United States and its allies and the
*02:28.620- 02:34.360* :  Houthi rebels, with a declaration of war from one leader of the Iranian-backed group.
*02:34.360- 02:40.820* :  The Houthis say a U.S. decision to designate the Yemeni-based group as a global terrorist organization
*02:40.820- 02:46.360* :  will not deter them from attacking ships in the Red Sea. That's been evidenced by reports
*02:46.360- 02:52.200* :  of a strike on a U.S. registered ship in the Red Sea. The designation follows weeks of attacks by
*02:52.200- 02:57.600* :  the Houthis, a rebel group that controls large parts of Yemen. Well, one of the group's political
*02:57.600- 03:07.600* :  leaders, Mohammad Al-Bakhati, spoke to the BBC. Because we are at war against America and Britain,
*03:08.180- 03:13.980* :  therefore, this decision won't change a thing. We will continue until the genocide stops in Gaza
*03:14.320- 03:18.120* :  and food, fuel and medicines are allowed in for its residents.
*03:24.020- 03:28.140* :  That was Mohammad Al-Bakhati speaking on behalf of the Yemen-based Houthis.
*03:28.620- 03:33.540* :  For more on this, I spoke to our State Department correspondent in Washington, DC, Tom Bateman,
*03:34.000- 03:39.000* :  and I asked him whether the situation looked like it was de-escalating as the United States had
*03:39.000- 03:44.960* :  previously stated was it same? No, it doesn't, and we've heard similar messages ever since the
*03:45.020- 03:54.440* :  American British joint strikes on Yemeni soil targeting missile and drone systems last week.
*03:55.080- 03:59.740* :  But I think what is notable about the attacks that have happened so far, and we're still waiting,
*03:59.740- 04:05.820* :  of course, for the full details of this one now, south of Aden, in the Gulf of Aden there,
*04:06.220- 04:11.020* :  is that they haven't been at the level of some of the attacks that we saw before
*04:11.760- 04:17.700* :  the American British strike. So, for example, Tuesday last week was a very big, kind of
*04:17.700- 04:22.620* :  swarming attack of suicide drones and ballistic and cruise missiles together. One of those,
*04:23.100- 04:28.460* :  according to the UK account, was heading towards a British warship. It was shot down,
*04:28.880- 04:33.440* :  and that was 48 hours before this strike. I think that was the last, the final straw,
*04:33.440- 04:38.500* :  as far as the Americans and the British were concerned. I think my sense in Washington is the
*04:38.500- 04:44.700* :  US feels that so far this is a sort of tactical success that they've degraded the Houthi's capabilities
*04:44.700- 04:50.520* :  and so far deterred them. But as you say, we await because the Houthis have come out with these
*04:50.820- 04:54.260* :  very strong warnings that they're going to continue and that they're going to escalate.
*04:54.600- 04:59.560* :  And just on the technicalities of the designation by the Biden administration of this Houthi
*04:59.560- 05:04.220* :  group as yet again, being a terrorist group as far as the US sees it, does that mean any significant
*05:04.220- 05:07.660* :  change in what the administration can do materially or politically?
*05:08.860- 05:13.300* :  It doesn't mean that much in terms of what they can really do to damage the Houthis on the ground
*05:13.440- 05:18.780* :  because the Houthis were already subject to quite significant and severe sanctions,
*05:18.780- 05:24.580* :  to visa and travel restrictions. You know, I mean, someone in Sanaa was telling me that if you
*05:24.580- 05:29.500* :  have a Houthi passport or a passport issued by the Houthi authorities, civilians, you can't go
*05:29.500- 05:36.120* :  anywhere apart from perhaps to Syria and Iran or sort of, you know, a handful of other places you
*05:36.120- 05:42.280* :  can't travel. So, you know, there's already a very, very isolated organization. What has happened
*05:42.280- 05:48.500* :  here, I think, is that this is the US administration trying to exert a bit more pressure on the Houthis.
*05:48.500- 05:54.100* :  I don't think it will have, as I say, that much of a concrete impact. Tom Bateman in Washington,
*05:55.200- 06:00.160* :  now, while the world's eyes are on the war and Gaza, violence between Israeli forces and
*06:00.160- 06:06.480* :  Palestinians has been rising in the occupied West Bank as well. The UN says that more than 300
*06:06.480- 06:12.160* :  Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army since the Hamas attacks on Israel three months
*06:12.160- 06:17.700* :  ago. Some have accused Israel of killing Palestinians without cause. I'm at least
*06:17.700- 06:22.960* :  correspondent Lucy Williamson has been investigating one Israeli air strike in Ash,
*06:23.300- 06:28.800* :  who had a village near Janine this month. It killed seven men from the same extended family,
*06:28.800- 06:39.360* :  four of them, brothers. There have been intense bursts of gunfire here now for about an hour.
*06:39.360- 06:44.480* :  The Israeli army is making its way into Janine again as it has done over the past few months
*06:44.480- 06:53.400* :  again and again and again. It's determined ever since the Hamas attacks to root out Hamas
*06:53.400- 06:58.600* :  and its sympathizers in the West Bank armed groups, particularly here in Janine,
*06:58.600- 07:06.220* :  are more determined than ever to resist. We are experiencing a wave of Israeli attacks all the time.
*07:06.220- 07:13.220* :  We can barely sleep during the night. Smile is a 25-year-old translator who lives in Janine camp.
*07:13.300- 07:21.080* :  It is like tragic, unbelievable I think, but I say like we care more about the people and
*07:21.180- 07:27.380* :  the loss of our beloved ones. As Israeli forces withdrew from a similar operation here 10 days ago,
*07:27.380- 07:33.860* :  an air strike killed seven men in a village a few miles from Janine, including four brothers,
*07:34.040- 07:41.540* :  Al-Ahaazah, Ahmad and Hamid. A spot where the brothers were killed is on the central
*07:41.540- 07:48.340* :  reservation of this main road through the village of Ashrafada. There are a few stones set out
*07:48.340- 07:54.760* :  in a circle, some flowers wilting on the pavement. There's an overturned chair. The corrugated iron
*07:54.760- 08:03.460* :  shelter behind it is peppered with shrapnel holes. Al-Ahaazah, Ahmad, Ahmad, Ahmad.
*08:03.780- 08:09.600* :  Their mother, if the Hamas was visited the site for the first time this week, even though her remaining
*08:09.600- 08:16.540* :  children begged her not to. I wanted to come and imagine where each of them was sitting.
*08:17.220- 08:24.260* :  Al-Ahaazah was there, Ahmad, Rahmi, and Azaz were here. There were the other martyrs.
*08:24.840- 08:31.260* :  I wanted to see exactly where my son's were. It was a cold morning that day and witnesses say
*08:31.260- 08:37.400* :  the men had huddled around a small fire to keep warm. Khalid al-Ahmed, one of the first
*08:37.400- 08:44.800* :  paramedics on the scene, is convinced the men were doing nothing wrong. One of them was wearing
*08:44.800- 08:50.380* :  slippers and pajamas. Do you think that someone who wants to resist the Israeli occupation
*08:51.060- 09:01.060* :  would at least wear proper shoes? Was there any sign of anything? I would tell you if there were
*09:01.060- 09:08.560* :  weapons. Honesty, these were civilians. Nothing related to resistance. No bullets, no weapons.
*09:11.340- 09:17.440* :  Palestinian groups proudly claim many members killed in Israeli operations as martyrs for their
*09:17.440- 09:23.880* :  cause. Norton have claimed the four Darwish brothers. The family showed us Israeli entry permits
*09:23.880- 09:29.980* :  for two of the men. No one, Israel sees as a security threat, would have them. We asked the Israeli
*09:29.980- 09:35.340* :  army why the men were targeted. They said an aircraft had struck a terrorist squad that
*09:35.340- 09:42.580* :  hurled explosives as Israeli forces and sent us a video filmed by night vision drone showing flashes
*09:42.580- 09:46.860* :  near a passing vehicle that analysts say are consistent with explosives.
*09:49.860- 09:55.060* :  Hours before the air strike a 19-year-old border policeman was killed during the army's operation
*09:55.060- 10:00.940* :  in Janine. The soldiers withdrew along the road through Ashuhada. Oh wow, I'll come to
*10:00.940- 10:06.140* :  in the hour. Two witnesses, it's a nearby cafe that night, told us the soldiers left the village,
*10:06.460- 10:13.160* :  15 minutes to an hour before the strike took place. We asked the army when their footage was filmed.
*10:14.000- 10:20.600* :  They said they had nothing to add. At the small village cemetery, cats wander in from the farmland
*10:20.600- 10:28.760* :  behind. Seven fresh graves marked with stones and photos. Iptosam touches the image of each of
*10:28.760- 10:37.280* :  her children in turn. They were all gone. I expected that one of them might have been martyred,
*10:37.780- 10:45.160* :  but not the four of them. They took my whole family away. Who can I complain to when all countries
*10:45.160- 10:50.720* :  are supporting Israel? Israel's war in Gaza has inflamed the conflict here to
*10:51.560- 10:56.720* :  the pain of a nation that failed to stop a brutal attack and the pain of a mother
*10:57.120- 11:03.860* :  unable to protect. Lucy Williamson reporting from the occupied West Bank. Now let's stay in the region
*11:03.860- 11:09.040* :  and look at another flashpoint. After Iran launched a missile strike on an area of its neighbour,
*11:09.040- 11:15.200* :  Pakistan. Pakistan has recalled its ambassador from Iran to protest at what it described as
*11:15.200- 11:21.040* :  a blatant breach of its sovereignty. It came after a drone strike in Balochistan in the west
*11:21.040- 11:26.680* :  of Pakistan that happened on Tuesday. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdulahin,
*11:26.680- 11:32.880* :  said the operation targeted the militant group, Jais al-Adli, which it described as an Iranian
*11:32.880- 11:41.380* :  terrorist group. We only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan before this.
*11:42.020- 11:49.240* :  I talked to my colleague, the honorable foreign minister of Pakistan, and I assured him that we
*11:49.240- 11:55.480* :  do respect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Pakistan. Also, those of Iraq,
*11:56.200- 12:02.220* :  but we don't allow a national security to be compromised.
*12:03.200- 12:08.480* :  Well, officials in Islamabad said two children were killed and three others injured in the attack.
*12:09.080- 12:11.880* :  The Pakistani foreign ministry statement warned of consequences.
*12:12.520- 12:20.260* :  Its spokesperson is Zara Baloch. Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act
*12:20.840- 12:28.520* :  and the responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran. We have conveyed this message
*12:29.140- 12:35.980* :  to the government of Iran. We have also informed them that Pakistan has decided to recall its
*12:35.980- 12:42.780* :  ambassador from Iran and that the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan, who is currently visiting Iran,
*12:43.480- 12:49.500* :  may not return for the time being. So, those are the views of Pakistan and also before that,
*12:49.500- 12:54.900* :  Iran. For some more analysis, I spoke to Param Ghibadi from BBC Persian Service.
*12:55.400- 13:02.000* :  Iran considers this Islamist Sunni group as a terrorist organization, so they want to show that
*13:02.000- 13:06.200* :  for domestic use is they want to show that we are taking revenge against those responsible.
*13:06.520- 13:11.000* :  And is that what you think this is? This is the latest installment, the third installment, perhaps,
*13:11.000- 13:18.420* :  in an inherently domestic security issue? Or is there a broader regional security sense to this?
*13:18.480- 13:24.480* :  The Iranian foreign minister was speaking in Davos and he mentioned that the tension in the region,
*13:24.480- 13:29.160* :  especially what is happening in the red seas and by who these who are backed by Iranians,
*13:29.160- 13:36.400* :  will not come to an end unless the war in Gaza stops. So, they are shown because, as you know,
*13:36.400- 13:41.680* :  Hamas is one of the most important Iranian proxies in the region and that's a leverage that Iran
*13:41.680- 13:46.580* :  can use against Israelis and the United States and its allies. But the reason for striking Pakistan,
*13:46.580- 13:54.040* :  the reason for striking a bill several days ago, the reason for striking targets in Syria are
*13:54.040- 13:57.660* :  all different, aren't they? Yes, they're giving different reasons. For example, Iranian foreign
*13:57.660- 14:03.940* :  minister said that we did not kill any Pakistani nationals in our attack. We killed Iranian
*14:03.940- 14:10.380* :  terrorists who are based in Pakistan. Iran is flexing its muscles, showing that showing its
*14:10.380- 14:15.960* :  deterrence capabilities, which is mainly two things, drone technology and also missile. How
*14:15.960- 14:21.000* :  incendiary do you think this is in terms of relationships with Islamabad, the Pakistan government?
*14:21.000- 14:28.020* :  And before that, with Iraq's government, Iraq, Syria, those two places, the Iran targeted first
*14:28.020- 14:33.340* :  and then Pakistan took place. Those are Iran was, you know, it was a restrained attack. Iran was
*14:33.340- 14:39.160* :  sure that there is not going to be a backlash because they know that the the Kurdistan autonomous
*14:39.160- 14:44.740* :  region won't be able to strike back Iran. It live was the opponents of Bashar al-Assad,
*14:45.080- 14:51.220* :  our base there. Pakistan is a different context. It's a nuclear armed country that Iran does
*14:51.220- 14:56.660* :  not have any experience of, you know, launching such attack on this scale against inside the
*14:56.660- 15:01.540* :  Pakistani territory. And that's why you see that Pakistanis are extremely furious. What's the
*15:01.540- 15:07.980* :  message that Tehran is trying to send to the United States and the Biden administration in doing
*15:07.980- 15:15.400* :  this? Iran has an extremely archaic, for example, air fleet, right? Iran's only and only deterrence
*15:15.400- 15:21.600* :  capability. It's its drone and missile capability. So Iran, it's flexing its muscles showing that,
*15:21.600- 15:27.340* :  for example, when they targeted it live, they were saying that we targeted it live our missiles,
*15:27.340- 15:33.800* :  traveled 1,200 kilometers. That's a clear signal to Israelis and Americans that we've got weapons.
*15:33.800- 15:38.800* :  And today, Gary today, Iranian defense minister said that we've got missiles that can travel up
*15:38.800- 15:45.440* :  to 2,000 kilometers. So they are showing the West that we can target Israel or the entire region
*15:45.440- 15:52.100* :  almost with our missiles. Baham, go buddy from BBC Persian. Now, this happens in the UK parliament.
*16:01.500- 16:06.900* :  After months of division and disagreement, Britain's prime minister Rishi Sunak has succeeded
*16:06.900- 16:13.180* :  in getting his plan to send some asylum seekers and illegal migrants to Rwanda through the
*16:13.180- 16:18.280* :  Lower House of Parliament. In the face of opposition, from many within his own ruling conservative
*16:18.280- 16:24.580* :  party, the legislation is intended to ensure that deportations are not blocked by the courts
*16:24.580- 16:30.260* :  in the UK. Many of his MPs thought the legislation wasn't tough enough though. The bill passed
*16:30.260- 16:36.340* :  with a majority of 44 and I asked Rob Watson, our political correspondent if this was a significant
*16:36.340- 16:41.080* :  victory for the Prime Minister. It was a convincing victory and Rishi Sunak will be
*16:41.080- 16:44.880* :  very relieved. I don't think it was entirely surprising, Rob, because if you think how
*16:45.300- 16:49.700* :  incredibly important this Rwanda policy is to the conservatives and indeed to those
*16:50.340- 16:53.700* :  on the right of the party who've been threatening to rebel, they wanted to happen. They just
*16:53.700- 16:58.920* :  thought that it wasn't quite tough enough this law. And I think the party also realised that if
*16:58.920- 17:03.660* :  they'd voted down this policy, the damage that would have done to Rishi Sunak would have been
*17:04.000- 17:08.100* :  enormous. It would have really precipitated a pretty major crisis for his leadership.
*17:08.500- 17:13.480* :  All of that said, Rob, I think in many ways an awful lot of damage has already been done to
*17:13.480- 17:18.600* :  the conservatives and to Mr Sunak by the sort of squabbling we've seen over the last couple
*17:18.600- 17:24.780* :  of days over this policy. So for him in terms of domestic politics in what's going to be a general
*17:24.780- 17:31.400* :  election year almost certainly, does this strengthen him or does it expose some of those
*17:31.780- 17:39.020* :  divisions on what is a key policy area? So I think in the short term, it damages him in the
*17:39.020- 17:43.440* :  sense that there has been this clear breakdown in discipline in the governing conservative
*17:43.440- 17:50.180* :  party, although of course they have recovered it in the last few hours. But I think it really depends
*17:50.180- 17:55.900* :  on what happens next. It really depends on whether there really are flights to Rwanda, whether
*17:55.900- 18:02.480* :  they really are able to send migrants to there for processing. And whether indeed that policy
*18:02.860- 18:07.340* :  ends up doing what it's supposed to do, what Rishi Sunak said he wants it to do, which is to
*18:07.340- 18:12.900* :  deter migrants from coming to the UK. And there's an awful lot of steps in between that, Rob,
*18:12.900- 18:16.300* :  and because it still needs to get through the upper chain with the House of Lords.
*18:16.800- 18:21.060* :  There are bound to be all sorts of legal challenges even once this law is passed.
*18:21.740- 18:27.980* :  So I guess you could say Mr Sunak has maybe made some progress on this issue but has a long
*18:27.980- 18:33.040* :  way to go. One thing I would just quickly throw in though that polling does suggest that people
*18:33.040- 18:39.240* :  who voted for Brexit in 2016 and who voted again for the Conservatives in 2019, they do very much
*18:39.240- 18:44.220* :  support this policy, the idea of sending people to Rwanda. Rob Watson reporting.
*18:47.620- 18:51.800* :  Later in this podcast, police in Spain uncover an illegal drug ring.
*18:54.960- 18:57.940* :  They say it was linked to Shaman and spiritualism.
*19:02.840- 19:08.640* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Police in Ecuador say a prosecutor who was investigating
*19:08.860- 19:14.160* :  an attack by government on a television studio during a live broadcast has been murdered.
*19:14.740- 19:20.200* :  Since her suarez was shot numerous times as he drove his car on a motorway in the city of Guay
*19:20.200- 19:26.140* :  Kill, our South America correspondent only Wells has more. Last week, Ecuador was in shock after
*19:26.140- 19:31.920* :  mass to gunmen broken to the public television channel TC while the studio was live on air and
*19:31.920- 19:37.420* :  held staff at gunpoint. It happened a day after the president declared a state of emergency in
*19:37.420- 19:42.880* :  response to days of unrest that saw two gang leaders escape from jail, police officers kidnapped
*19:42.880- 19:48.620* :  and explosives set off in the streets. Now in the city of Guay Kill, where the attack took place,
*19:48.620- 19:53.080* :  the Ecuadorian prosecutor tasked with investigating it has reportedly been killed.
*19:53.080- 19:58.480* :  Seis Aswarez is the latest shocking example of how those tasked with pursuing violent,
*19:58.480- 20:03.120* :  organised crime have often become targets themselves. I only Wells reporting.
*20:04.040- 20:09.020* :  A Sri Lankan politician who murdered a rival and three of his supporters in a shootout at a
*20:09.020- 20:14.160* :  road junction is at the centre of a very public dispute between the government and the country's
*20:14.160- 20:18.940* :  supreme court. Dhumundi Silva was sentenced to death for the murders back in 2011,
*20:18.940- 20:25.660* :  but then pardoned by the then-president Scott Abaya Rajapaksa. Now Sri Lankas' senior judges
*20:25.660- 20:31.580* :  have overruled that decision, finding there was no legal basis to it. For more on this, I spoke
*20:31.580- 20:37.580* :  to a correspondent Ambrassan Etirajan. It was the time of the Sri Lankas powerful president Mahinder
*20:37.580- 20:43.960* :  Ajapaksha. It was a couple of years after the end of the major civil war in which the Sri Lankan
*20:43.960- 20:49.880* :  army defeated the Tamil tiger rebels, so Mr Ajapaksha was quite powerful. And this particular incident
*20:49.980- 20:56.120* :  happened between two factions within that same rolling alliance of Ajapaksha. So Dhumundi
*20:56.140- 21:02.780* :  was a very controversial figure. He was linked with the underworld in Sri Lanka around that time,
*21:02.780- 21:08.560* :  but then he joined the alliance of Madrasapaksha. Then he had rivalry with another politician
*21:08.560- 21:15.500* :  called Lakshman Bharata Premachandra. Both of them had this rivalry about certain party positions
*21:15.500- 21:23.120* :  in 2011, when these two groups they met and then the fighting started and then they started
*21:23.120- 21:28.200* :  shooting at each other. So Mr Premachandra and four others were killed in this incident,
*21:28.200- 21:34.320* :  but then it took a few years until the government changed to bring charges against Mr Dhumundi
*21:34.320- 21:40.480* :  Silva. Finally, he was given the death penalty in the 2016 and four others were given the sentencing,
*21:40.480- 21:45.700* :  they were found guilty of the murder of Mr Premachandra, and then the supreme court also
*21:45.700- 21:50.800* :  appealed the decision. But then Gautabar Ajapaksha, who was the different secretary previously,
*21:50.800- 21:56.440* :  became the president in 2019 and within four months after coming to power, he gave pardon.
*21:56.440- 22:02.460* :  People thought it was like he was using his presidential power to pardon this very controversial
*22:02.460- 22:08.100* :  figure. Now the supreme court has categorically said, Mr Ajapaksha, that's not given any valid
*22:08.100- 22:13.400* :  reason. The decision was irrational and that's why now they have revoked the pardon to Silva.
*22:13.580- 22:19.380* :  So is he going back to jail? Is he going to face the death penalty, which was the initial ruling
*22:19.380- 22:24.120* :  when he was convicted? He has been staying in hospital after the supreme court
*22:24.980- 22:29.280* :  gave an interim order saying that he should be going back to prison. He was saying that he was
*22:29.280- 22:35.200* :  unwell, so he was in hospital. Now it depends on the court and the judges when he will be sent back
*22:35.200- 22:39.920* :  to prison. Sri Lanka has a moratorium on the death penalty. They don't usually execute people
*22:39.920- 22:45.720* :  even though they give the death penalty. So that is what people expect him to spend the rest of his
*22:45.720- 22:51.240* :  life in prison, but given the Sri Lankan political situation, you know, it's anybody's guess what
*22:51.240- 22:56.580* :  will happen after five or ten years. Ambra Saneti Rajan reporting, police in Spain have
*22:56.580- 23:01.820* :  raided properties and broken up what they say was a drugs ring involving shamanic rituals.
*23:02.620- 23:07.020* :  Eighteen people have been arrested, large quantities of drugs were seized in the operation.
*23:07.680- 23:09.640* :  From Madrid, he's more from Guy Hitchcock.
*23:12.720- 23:18.000* :  Police sent to one of the properties where some of the suspects were arrested and substances
*23:18.000- 23:24.560* :  were seized. According to police, those detained had organized gatherings where dangerous psychotropic
*23:24.560- 23:30.380* :  drugs were supplied in exchange for money. These events of which the substances were administered
*23:30.380- 23:36.520* :  in shamanic ceremonies took place across Spain and in several other countries, including in Latin
*23:36.520- 23:42.920* :  America. The police investigation was prompted by online advertisements promising that the rituals
*23:42.920- 23:49.300* :  would improve emotional and physical well-being. Among the substances seized were one kilo of
*23:49.300- 23:56.340* :  mescaline and 60 kilos of ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drink traditionally used by Amazonian tribes.
*23:57.300- 24:01.880* :  Change of gear now. Let's look at Saudi Arabia's big, big money push into football,
*24:02.540- 24:05.260* :  and news that it hasn't really worked out for one of the top name
*24:05.260- 24:10.640* :  signings. The England International Jordan Henderson left Liverpool last year. A vocal supporter
*24:10.640- 24:15.940* :  of gay rights, he moved to a much lower level league in a country that bans same sex marriage.
*24:16.640- 24:21.320* :  Six months on though, it looks like he's not happy with his new life and is moving back to Europe
*24:21.320- 24:26.860* :  and the Dutch club Iax. Our reporter, Simea Hashmi, is following the story for us from Dubai.
*24:27.600- 24:28.520* :  So, what went wrong?
*24:29.040- 24:33.940* :  Things were challenging in Henderson's case right from the word go. He found it difficult to
*24:33.940- 24:39.460* :  adjust in the conditions of climate, the Saudi climate, because it's not easy to play in those
*24:39.460- 24:44.440* :  high temperatures, which is predominantly the weather until October, November, and a large part
*24:44.440- 24:48.840* :  of the season is actually played during the summer season. So, I think that was one challenge.
*24:48.840- 24:52.660* :  Second was that his family was staying in Bahrain, which is across the border from the mob,
*24:53.200- 24:58.440* :  the city where Alitafak is club is based in. So, it was a one hour drive every day to
*24:58.440- 25:03.340* :  this sea, the family, because Bahrain is more liberal compared to Saudi Arabia. And third, I think
*25:03.340- 25:10.400* :  they were also concerns about him not losing his spot in the English side during the Euros.
*25:11.020- 25:16.400* :  Probably this is last chance to win a title with the England team. And I think if you compare
*25:16.400- 25:21.600* :  Anderson's case to other stars, big names who have signed up for the Saudi pro league, whether
*25:21.600- 25:27.080* :  it's Neymar, Ronaldo, Benzema, Mane. The biggest difference was that all these big stars have
*25:27.080- 25:31.960* :  primarily signed up for the big four clubs in the Saudi pro league. Whereas for Alitafak,
*25:31.960- 25:37.920* :  it was a mid-table club, crowds during the matches haven't been huge. I think Anderson ended
*25:37.920- 25:42.100* :  up signing up for a club, not one of the big clubs, where he would have probably enjoyed more
*25:42.100- 25:46.880* :  with the huge stoneouts and playing with some of the bigger stars. What do you understand in terms
*25:46.880- 25:51.380* :  of the sort of financial penalties he might now in care, because obviously one of the big
*25:51.380- 25:56.840* :  lures for all these stars going to play in Saudi is the fact that they've paid just enormous
*25:56.840- 26:02.640* :  sums of money. And how far could Jordan Henderson actually not only lose that income, but also
*26:02.640- 26:07.740* :  possibly have a massive tax bill to settle? I think the two things are going to happen. First,
*26:07.740- 26:13.300* :  yes, he will have to pay a hefty amount in terms of taxes on the income for those six months.
*26:13.300- 26:17.160* :  How much would that be as difficult to say at the stage, but it will be in millions of pounds.
*26:17.720- 26:22.040* :  And the second is he will have to take a wage cut, because even though he's heading to his new
*26:22.040- 26:26.860* :  club, the terms and conditions have not been announced in terms of what will he be getting paid
*26:26.860- 26:32.560* :  and the actual contract details. So there is that major financial implication. And I think he
*26:32.560- 26:37.160* :  received a lot of criticism when he did sign up for the Saudi pro league, given that he was one
*26:37.160- 26:43.260* :  of the most prominent English players to go to Saudi Arabia and given that LGBT rights is
*26:43.260- 26:49.520* :  something he's advocated for a long time. And moving to a country where LGBTQ rights are not
*26:49.520- 26:53.980* :  legal, it was kind of a double edged sword, but I think he pretty much knew what he's getting into
*26:53.980- 26:58.680* :  right from the start. And even some of the statements that came out initially were in a way,
*26:58.680- 27:03.620* :  a huge defense of the fact that he still stands for those values and in no way he's going to give
*27:03.620- 27:08.140* :  up on that. And in fact, I think one of the arguments being made was that by playing in a country
*27:09.060- 27:13.420* :  where LGBTQ rights are not recognized, he could be an ambassador for that, but that clearly didn't
*27:13.420- 27:18.200* :  pan out. I mean, we didn't see any kind of, you know, him wearing the rainbow arm band on the
*27:18.200- 27:22.280* :  field or anything like that in Saudi Arabia while playing some of those matches. And that was
*27:22.280- 27:27.520* :  another criticism. Simeh Hashmi in Dubai. Now, we're going to end this edition of the global
*27:27.520- 27:34.300* :  news podcast on the Irish language. And one band's efforts to spread the word kneecap are a trio
*27:34.300- 27:39.720* :  from Belfast who've sold out gigs in the UK, Ireland and the United States. Now the rappers are
*27:39.720- 27:44.540* :  making their acting debut. Their self-titled film, which also stars Michael Fassbender,
*27:45.040- 27:50.600* :  is having its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in the US. It's the first time an Irish language
*27:50.600- 27:54.880* :  film has been included there. Our culture correspondent Charlotte Gallagher met them.
*27:56.660- 28:01.940* :  Kneecap are at the forefront of Irish hip-hop, rapping in both Irish and English.
*28:11.020- 28:16.340* :  Their self-titled film, a semi-fictionalised account of how they got together, also blends the two
*28:16.340- 28:22.400* :  languages. They called our generation the ceasefire baby. Kneecap member Mohara says it challenges
*28:22.400- 28:28.340* :  preconceptions about the Irish language. It's about these three flowers trying to find, you know,
*28:28.340- 28:32.860* :  the place in the world and it's about, you know, the identity and stuff like that. So everybody has
*28:32.860- 28:37.120* :  this idea of the Irish language that, like, we all just sit about pubs, playing fiddles and
*28:37.120- 28:40.840* :  talking about grammar. You know, in a main one and act of fact, these three characters don't
*28:40.840- 28:45.760* :  really mention the language that much. The whole film, they're like sound drugs and like talking
*28:45.760- 28:50.600* :  about youth culture through the language rather than their living and surviving through the language.
*28:52.140- 28:57.560* :  You've heard of intergenerational trauma, right? Right? Our history? Our history has become our biology.
*28:58.760- 29:04.000* :  It's like the trauma our ancestors suffered, has inserted itself, has actually inserted itself
*29:04.000- 29:10.920* :  in our genetic code. Kneecap grew up after the Good Friday agreement in a time of relative peace.
*29:10.920- 29:16.220* :  The film explores what that means to young people in Northern Ireland. The trio had never
*29:16.220- 29:21.840* :  acted before. Director Rich Peppierts says that was an initial challenge. It wasn't they couldn't
*29:21.920- 29:26.120* :  act. They didn't know how to act. We got them bought an acting coach and they absolutely
*29:26.120- 29:29.360* :  blossomed weak by week. And I think the biggest thing people are going to be surprised about
*29:29.360- 29:35.160* :  is just how good they are on screen. And, you know, they are acting opposite people like Michael
*29:35.160- 29:40.600* :  Fassbender, Simone Kirby, some of the greatest actors islands produced in, you know, a generation.
*29:40.720- 29:43.020* :  And they don't look like they're because they've won a raffle.
*29:44.480- 29:49.080* :  Kneecap are not without controversy. Their name is derived from so-called kneecapping where
*29:49.080- 29:54.520* :  people are shot in the legs by paramilitaries. And a mural dedicated to them showing a police
*29:54.520- 30:01.200* :  land Rover on fire, upset some local politicians. But rapper Mogli Bap says they want to make music,
*30:01.620- 30:06.500* :  not stir up tensions. I think controversy is definitely subjective because like you had the
*30:06.500- 30:12.180* :  song get your bridge set. There has nothing to do with a mass exodus of British people from the
*30:12.180- 30:15.900* :  north of Ireland or anything like that. Which people like to believe is what they believe.
*30:16.240- 30:20.140* :  But in reality, the song is about taking the TUP out in the net out. So in many aspects,
*30:20.140- 30:25.800* :  people have different ideas of what we are. But we obviously just make music.
*30:27.480- 30:32.940* :  The third member of Kneecap, DJ Provi, performs in a balaclava in the colours of the Irish flag.
*30:33.500- 30:38.340* :  That was initially a disguise. When he first joined the band, he was working as a primary school
*30:38.340- 30:44.100* :  teacher and didn't want people to know about his musical sideline. See this kind of aesthetic as
*30:44.100- 30:48.000* :  well, where people were in tracksuits and we kind of closed you were. It's associated with
*30:48.000- 30:53.960* :  a type of scumbagery and people just have that image. I was just about to say that as well.
*30:55.100- 30:58.460* :  With the balaclava as well, people will look at this and see I think it's a kind of
*30:58.460- 31:07.580* :  sectarian statement or something. And the pioneers in Irish rap gave me a language lesson before I left.
*31:07.880- 31:12.300* :  I'm waging shore. I'm waging shore. ML faster. ML faster.
*31:12.700- 31:13.700* :  Kneecap and you.
*31:14.000- 31:14.940* :  Kneecap and you.
*31:16.860- 31:21.100* :  Yeah. That was me attempting to say I'm here with Kneecap today in Belfast.
*31:24.580- 31:28.720* :  Kneecap in Irish and English and Choligalaga.
*31:31.840- 31:35.800* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
