*01:36.780- 01:41.300* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours, Friday the 26th of January, these are on main stories.
*01:41.300- 01:46.960* :  President Biden has appointed the CIA Chief William Burns to try to broker a deal to release
*01:46.960- 01:53.520* :  Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Pakistan says two of its citizens have been killed on its
*01:53.520- 02:00.300* :  soil by agents hired by India. Apple users in the European Union will have access to alternative
*02:00.300- 02:04.480* :  app stores, a move that the firm has previously resisted.
*02:06.940- 02:12.720* :  Also in this podcast, there remains were very well observed. There was bone, skin, fingernails,
*02:12.720- 02:18.600* :  toenails, and a kidney. We'll look at it. In a rare discovery, a human skeleton dating back more
*02:18.600- 02:28.360* :  than 2,000 years has been found in Northern Ireland. President Biden has appointed the director
*02:28.360- 02:34.340* :  of the CIA, William Burns, to help broker a deal on the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza.
*02:34.860- 02:40.140* :  He's to meet the Prime Minister of Qatar and a top official from Israel's intelligence service
*02:40.140- 02:45.560* :  in France soon. Against this backdrop, there's another imminent deadline for people in southern
*02:45.560- 02:51.620* :  Gaza. The UN says Israel has ordered tens of thousands of Palestinians, sheltering in a UN
*02:51.620- 02:57.900* :  compound in the city of Han Yunus to leave by Friday evening at 5 p.m. local time.
*02:57.900- 03:03.760* :  Israel's military says it's attacking militants in western Han Yunus with tanks and airstrikes.
*03:04.120- 03:08.280* :  These Palestinians who fled the fighting say they're in a desperate situation.
*03:09.820- 03:15.540* :  We were sitting minding our own business when suddenly tanks arrived and opened fire on us.
*03:15.860- 03:20.560* :  I don't know how I managed to get out, but praise be to God, I made it this far.
*03:22.080- 03:26.980* :  The situation is catastrophic. There's no water. It's very hard to find food. Food and water are
*03:26.980- 03:32.620* :  scarce. There are no vegetables. Even the sick at the hospital can't have healthy proper meals.
*03:34.760- 03:38.260* :  People are just fleeing. There are those who are injured, some were martyred.
*03:38.520- 03:41.500* :  They are all heading towards the coast and from there to Raffa.
*03:42.220- 03:46.520* :  I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem, Mark Glowin, more about the Israeli order.
*03:47.280- 03:52.380* :  And the Israeli evacuation order has been issued for that training centre, which is thought to
*03:52.380- 03:57.240* :  be sheltering around 30,000 people. One of the buildings in the training centre was hit by fire
*03:57.260- 04:01.680* :  on Wednesday that is said to have killed at least a dozen people and left more than 70 people
*04:01.680- 04:09.860* :  injured. Now the evacuation order is by Friday at 5pm local time, basically ordering people to move
*04:09.860- 04:16.160* :  south towards Raffa, which is right on the southern tip of Gaza on the border with Egypt and
*04:16.320- 04:20.860* :  is already crammed full of people, thought to have about one and a half million people sheltering
*04:20.860- 04:26.280* :  there. Now in terms of how easy it is to actually get out of that area around Hanyunis, well,
*04:26.280- 04:32.260* :  the Israeli military has surrounded Hanyunis and has encircled it. But the UN says that the attack
*04:32.260- 04:37.400* :  on the training centre on Wednesday was egregious and that they had shared the coordinates with
*04:37.400- 04:42.660* :  the Israeli authorities about that facility. Israel says that it has investigated and it was not
*04:42.660- 04:46.160* :  behind that attack and has suggested that it could have been a Hamas rocket.
*04:46.620- 04:52.220* :  There are still many people in and around Hanyunis in hospitals and the Hamas run health
*04:52.220- 04:55.840* :  ministry is saying that the conditions there are deteriorating. Again, it's going to be very
*04:55.840- 05:01.900* :  difficult for those individuals to flee if they're incapacitated. Yes, the UN says that women
*05:01.900- 05:07.900* :  who had just given birth by C-section in one of three remaining party functional hospitals in the
*05:07.900- 05:12.720* :  south around Hanyunis were forced to evacuate in the middle of the night. Now that hospital from
*05:12.720- 05:17.980* :  which they did evacuate has now stopped functioning leaving two left. Remember the World Health
*05:17.980- 05:24.360* :  Organization says that two-thirds of the hospitals across Gaza no longer function at all and only
*05:24.360- 05:30.480* :  a third are partly functioning. The Israeli ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Mereveleon Shahat,
*05:30.860- 05:36.440* :  very strong words coming out of her saying, look, the W.H.O. is showing some kind of collusion
*05:36.440- 05:42.080* :  because they're ignoring the fact in her words that Hamas run hospitals are being used for
*05:42.200- 05:47.040* :  terrorist organizations, for terrorist activity, very strong words coming out there.
*05:47.340- 05:51.760* :  They are and I think very much shows that Israeli increasingly feels that a sort of an array
*05:51.760- 05:57.040* :  of international bodies are stacked against it and that there is a sort of international bias
*05:57.040- 06:03.480* :  from institutions largely UN bodies and that they take the court of international public opinion
*06:03.480- 06:08.220* :  with them. So it all might come to a head really on Friday when the International Court of Justice
*06:08.220- 06:15.960* :  in the Hague is to issue preliminary instructions about South Africa's case that Israel is committing
*06:15.960- 06:19.140* :  genocide in Gaza, which of course Israel absolutely thoroughly refutes.
*06:19.900- 06:26.480* :  Mark Loen Pakistan has accused India of killing two of its citizens on its territory.
*06:26.480- 06:32.580* :  The Foreign Secretary Mohammed Cyrus Qazi said there was evidence that Indian agents were involved
*06:32.580- 06:36.080* :  in the assassinations in Pakistan. Caroline Davis reports.
*06:36.660- 06:40.080* :  The Secretary did not explain why India may have wished to kill the two men.
*06:40.460- 06:45.600* :  India has previously claimed one was a militant connected to an attack on an Indian air force base,
*06:45.940- 06:50.080* :  Pakistan suggested that these killings followed a similar pattern to targeted killings
*06:50.080- 06:55.760* :  of Sikh separatists allegedly carried out or attempted by India on Canadian and American soil
*06:55.760- 07:01.760* :  last year. Pakistan said that India must be held accountable for violating Pakistan's sovereignty.
*07:01.760- 07:07.940* :  India responded calling Pakistan the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime and illegal
*07:07.940- 07:14.720* :  transnational activities. Caroline Davis. A day after a Russian plane crashed near the border with
*07:14.720- 07:20.320* :  Ukraine. The war of words about what happened continues. Russia says Ukraine shot down the plane,
*07:20.320- 07:26.140* :  which it adds was returning Ukrainian prisoners of war. It says that investigators at the side of
*07:26.140- 07:31.900* :  the crash in the Russian Belgrade region near Ukraine's border have found missile fragments.
*07:32.740- 07:37.980* :  But Alexander Merezko, a Ukrainian member of parliament says Moscow is not to be trusted.
*07:38.740- 07:46.020* :  Russia is known for distorting facts and for holding information and psychological
*07:46.020- 07:52.600* :  propaganda campaigns. So the information from Russia should not be trusted under any circumstances.
*07:53.560- 08:01.120* :  We don't know who had shot down the military plane and who was aboard this plane.
*08:01.500- 08:08.000* :  That's the reason why our president made a statement and is demanding to hold independent
*08:08.000- 08:15.080* :  international investigation. BBC Russian news editor, Famil Ismailov, told me more about what
*08:15.080- 08:20.520* :  Moscow is saying about the plane. Russian authorities reported that the black boxes have been
*08:20.520- 08:28.880* :  discovered of the ill 76 that were shot down and they will be able to discover what were the
*08:28.880- 08:36.520* :  last seconds and minutes of the flight and they will be able to check the chat between the crew
*08:36.520- 08:43.160* :  and the traffic control and probably that will give us more technical detail on what has happened
*08:43.160- 08:50.060* :  to the plane. However, the Ukrainian side demands that the investigation is conducted by an
*08:50.060- 08:56.360* :  international body and the Russians do not accept that. And the importance of that is not lost on
*08:56.360- 09:05.080* :  anybody given what happened on previous crashes in eastern Ukraine, MH17. Explain why it's so
*09:05.080- 09:11.340* :  significant that you get independent experts on the ground. First, Russians are able to sort of
*09:11.340- 09:19.700* :  twist the facts and also able to technically create falsified facts on the ground. We've seen
*09:19.820- 09:26.600* :  with MH17, the Malaysian Airlines man, that was shot down above Ukraine in 2014. How Russia was
*09:26.600- 09:33.400* :  employing all possible technical skills and even propaganda skills to make sure that the fact that
*09:33.400- 09:40.460* :  the plane was shot by a missile, a Russian missile on a Russian launcher, they tried to cover this
*09:40.460- 09:45.880* :  up as much as they could and more they were trying to bring in all sorts of conspiracy theories.
*09:45.880- 09:51.640* :  In this particular case, we still have too many questions. The Russian side says that there
*09:51.640- 09:57.780* :  were 65 prisoners of war on board that were taking for exchange with the Russian prisoners on
*09:57.780- 10:07.280* :  Ukrainian side. That's fine, but the question is why the Ukrainian side wasn't informed of the
*10:07.280- 10:12.520* :  movement of that particular transport plane as Ukrainian side insists that they haven't.
*10:12.780- 10:18.640* :  To a lot of people, this might seem tragic, but it's still a side show to the broader issue of
*10:18.640- 10:25.060* :  the war. So how important is it in terms of the information war that Russia comes out of this
*10:25.960- 10:32.700* :  being seen to be the moral player, if you like? This is very much part of the information war,
*10:32.940- 10:39.680* :  because Russia does not divide information as a tool or propaganda as a tool as a weapon of the
*10:39.680- 10:46.420* :  war, starting with the families of the prisoners who were to be exchanged, to blame and increase
*10:46.420- 10:53.460* :  the pressure on leadership of Ukraine, to start thinking about the peace negotiations and
*10:53.460- 10:59.360* :  a compromise that would leave Russia with the territories that is occupying at the moment
*10:59.420- 11:04.800* :  in Ukraine. BBC Russia News Editor, Famil Ismailov.
*11:05.760- 11:12.360* :  What I call a Moscow has sentenced the Russian nationalist Uyghur-Kin to four years in jail for
*11:12.360- 11:17.860* :  inciting extremism. Uyghur-Kin has repeatedly criticized President Vladimir Putin and the
*11:17.860- 11:23.420* :  conduct of the war in Ukraine. He was a leader of the Russian-backed forces who began fighting in
*11:23.420- 11:29.400* :  eastern Ukraine in 2014. Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, was at the sentencing hearing in Moscow.
*11:30.040- 11:35.880* :  Igor Gyrkin had already been convicted by a Dutch court in absentia for shooting down a
*11:35.880- 11:42.000* :  Malaysian Airlines flight in eastern Ukraine and sentenced to life imprisonment which he ignored.
*11:42.000- 11:50.100* :  But now he is going to prison, though not for the murder of 298 people on board MH-17.
*11:50.320- 11:58.080* :  What are the results of the negotiations? Today, a judge in Moscow found Mr. Gyrkin guilty on extremism
*11:58.080- 12:05.000* :  charges and sentenced him to four years in a penal colony. The former FSB officer had become
*12:05.000- 12:11.280* :  a vocal critic of how the war in Ukraine is being fought, not hard enough in his view, but his
*12:11.280- 12:18.500* :  problems began when he began to insult Vladimir Putin. Last year, the ultra-nationalist pro-war blogger
*12:18.660- 12:24.240* :  had called the Kremlin leader a non-entity and a cowardly waste of space. A few days later,
*12:24.240- 12:33.820* :  he was arrested. In 2014, Mr. Gyrkin had played a key role in the early stages of Russia's war
*12:33.820- 12:40.040* :  in Ukraine, commanding pro-Russia militias in the Donbass. In recent years, the Kremlin has cleared the
*12:40.040- 12:46.580* :  political landscape to remove liberal pro-democracy, pro-Western rivals. The decision to send Igor
*12:46.580- 12:52.100* :  Gyrkin to jail suggests it's now targeting individuals at the opposite end of the spectrum,
*12:52.100- 12:56.320* :  the so-called ultra-patriots. It sees them too as a threat.
*12:57.380- 13:03.760* :  Steve Rosenberg, in a separate development, a Russian woman has been sentenced to 27 years in
*13:03.760- 13:10.520* :  prison for the killing of a pro-war blogger last April. Flatlen Tatarsky died when a bomb
*13:10.520- 13:16.880* :  hidden inside a small statue, given to him by Daria Trepova, exploded in St. Petersburg.
*13:16.940- 13:24.060* :  Trepova, who's 26, said she thought the statuette contained a listening device. Her sentence is
*13:24.060- 13:30.440* :  one of the longest ever imposed on a woman in Russia. Now, from Russia to neighbouring Georgia,
*13:30.440- 13:35.380* :  thousands of people in the country have found out that they were stolen from their parents
*13:35.380- 13:41.240* :  at birth and sold. It's believed the black market in baby trafficking operated for decades
*13:41.240- 13:47.560* :  from the late 1970s up to the mid-2000s. Some of the victims are now taking their cases to the
*13:47.560- 13:53.060* :  Georgian courts, hoping to get access to their birth documents so they can trace their biological
*13:53.060- 14:04.620* :  families. They nurse reports. Amy and Anna have traveled to Germany from Georgia to meet their
*14:04.620- 14:12.400* :  mother Azar for the first time. The identical twins were nervous about seeing her. They only
*14:12.400- 14:17.700* :  learned they were sisters two years ago after they were separated at birth and illegally adopted.
*14:23.020- 14:26.920* :  Azar was told by doctors her daughters had died shortly after giving birth.
*14:28.960- 14:34.800* :  From today, my life has great meaning. I'm so happy that I found my children.
*14:35.600- 14:41.580* :  For the twins, the reunion causes mixed emotions. Amy is overwhelmed at finding her mother.
*14:41.880- 14:48.800* :  I felt something like I never felt. Yeah, I'm shaking. I just want to come for her because I know
*14:48.800- 14:56.200* :  what she's feeling. Anna is angry at the web of lies. I don't know why, but when she hugged me,
*14:56.520- 15:03.740* :  I felt more anger than anything else. How the twins found each other is nothing
*15:03.740- 15:11.340* :  short of miraculous. Amy, a punky 21-year-old, posted a video of herself getting her eyebrow pierced.
*15:11.860- 15:19.440* :  Friends saw the video and sent it to Anna. One of my friends sent me a TikTok video of Amy.
*15:19.880- 15:22.540* :  When I saw her, I thought I was looking at myself.
*15:26.980- 15:31.040* :  They exchanged messages and eventually decided to meet up at a train station.
*15:31.200- 15:35.960* :  I was like, oh my god. Am I looking at the mirror?
*15:36.460- 15:41.580* :  It's the same person, it's the same face, it's the same voice, it's the same thoughts.
*15:41.580- 15:49.260* :  They both decided to confront their parents. We talked to our families and found out
*15:49.300- 15:53.900* :  that we were both sold illegally as children. I was heartbroken.
*15:54.520- 15:58.040* :  My whole life is a lie, that it was the first feeling I had.
*15:58.220- 16:02.720* :  But they soon realised they weren't alone when they came across a Facebook group with more than
*16:02.720- 16:08.740* :  230,000 members, all sharing similar stories, all hunting for the truth.
*16:09.760- 16:16.100* :  It was set up by a famous Georgian TV personality, Tommuna Maserica, who is also looking for her family.
*16:17.160- 16:22.440* :  She discovered she was adopted after finding another birth certificate with incorrect details.
*16:23.720- 16:27.100* :  When we meet Tommuna, she is on the phone, advising someone on their case.
*16:37.960- 16:40.760* :  Tommuna had opened a dark chapter in Georgian history,
*16:41.180- 16:43.740* :  tens of thousands of babies trafficked over decades.
*16:45.020- 16:49.680* :  She started working with human rights lawyer Liam McShavaria to try to bring justice to the
*16:49.680- 16:57.100* :  families. First, there are the cases where the biological mother voluntarily gave up the child,
*16:57.100- 17:02.640* :  either for money or for another reason. The second is a larger group of tragic stories,
*17:02.640- 17:07.460* :  where a mother is lied to in the maternity unit that her baby has died.
*17:07.820- 17:12.980* :  It's hard to understand how such a large illegal operation could thrive in a small country.
*17:14.200- 17:18.820* :  Lear explains a culture of shame around adoption, and the turbulence following Georgia's
*17:18.820- 17:24.880* :  independence from the Soviet Union played a part. People were poor, and criminality thrived.
*17:25.060- 17:29.640* :  Trilibisa, Estet, Autesa, adoption was not properly regulated by the state,
*17:30.080- 17:35.600* :  so people tried to solve this issue on their own. One thing I can say with certainty is that
*17:35.600- 17:40.560* :  this illegal adoption was systemic, and it operated and existed all over the country.
*17:41.240- 17:44.780* :  Lear and Timunus' work means that some cases could end up in court,
*17:45.300- 17:47.460* :  but Timunus still haven't found her own family.
*17:47.460- 17:57.900* :  The saddest part of my story is that I have reunited hundreds of families, and I cannot find my
*17:57.900- 18:04.380* :  biological parents. Georgia's government says it's investigating, but no arrests have been made.
*18:05.520- 18:10.720* :  That report by Faye Nurse, and you can watch the full documentary Betrayal at Birth,
*18:11.300- 18:15.680* :  Georgia's Stolen Children on the BBC World Service YouTube channel.
*18:16.600- 18:19.260* :  Now, it could be the opening line in a crime novel.
*18:19.760- 18:25.620* :  Body found in bog, but in reality it emerges that a very old body turns out to be ancient
*18:25.620- 18:31.760* :  human remains dating back over 2,000 years have been found in Peteland in Northern Ireland.
*18:31.820- 18:36.660* :  The world-preserved bones are thought to be those of a teenage boy.
*18:36.660- 18:42.880* :  It's the first time that radiocarbon dating has been used on a body found in a bog in Northern Ireland.
*18:43.440- 18:46.000* :  Our island correspondent Sarah Given reports.
*18:46.640- 18:50.460* :  In October last year, bog land outside the time of Blahy,
*18:50.840- 18:54.420* :  revealed a secret it had been keeping for more than 2,000 years.
*18:55.200- 18:59.000* :  A bone protruding through soil launched a police investigation.
*18:59.180- 19:04.600* :  The remains discovered as a result have been carbon dated to around 500 BC.
*19:04.780- 19:10.680* :  Detective Inspector Nikki DeHin was part of the team that spent three days uncovering them.
*19:10.900- 19:17.040* :  The remains were very well preserved. There was bone, skin, fingernails, toenails, and a kidney.
*19:17.040- 19:22.220* :  We're located. They were able to determine that the age of the remains would have been between
*19:22.220- 19:25.600* :  about 13 and 17 years at the time of death and possibly a male.
*19:25.940- 19:28.720* :  Dr. Alistair Ruffel is a forensic geologist.
*19:29.200- 19:33.740* :  All the bog bodies worldwide, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, are all given names.
*19:34.720- 19:40.680* :  Partly on the location, partly out of respect. I give my own a literative name which is
*19:40.680- 19:42.320* :  Belachivoy because of where we're near.
*19:42.540- 19:48.100* :  The remains were not guilty of a museum for scientific study and possibly will one day be put
*19:48.100- 19:51.740* :  on public display. Sarah Given reporting from Northern Ireland.
*19:54.880- 19:55.400* :  Still to come.
*19:56.040- 19:59.220* :  The line seems relaxed. It's in the back seat, the upper half of its body,
*19:59.640- 20:02.220* :  hanging upside of the car, two big paws on the doors.
*20:03.000- 20:07.760* :  Driving while in possession of a lion, the strange charge sheet from tight.

*22:00.420- 22:05.740* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. Now to the United States and the former president
*22:05.740- 22:11.520* :  Donald Trump has testified briefly at a New York court as part of his defense in a defamation case
*22:12.000- 22:18.040* :  brought by the fashion writer E. Jean Carroll. At stake is the amount of damages Mr. Trump will have
*22:18.040- 22:23.540* :  to pay for making defamatory statements against Ms. Carroll. Well, the former president has continued
*22:23.540- 22:28.980* :  to deny he has ever met Ms. Carroll despite a previous trial finding that he'd sexually assaulted her.
*22:28.980- 22:33.660* :  Nitorthic reports from New York. Outlining the ground rules for Donald Trump's
*22:33.660- 22:39.300* :  testimony took longer than the testimony itself. The judge left no room for him to go beyond the
*22:39.300- 22:45.200* :  agreed terms, making it impossible for him to launch into a monologue or to campaign from the witness
*22:45.200- 22:51.620* :  stand. He answered just a few questions saying that he stood by his deposition that E. Jean Carroll's
*22:51.620- 22:57.080* :  claims that he raped her were a hoax, then that he did not instruct anyone to hurt Ms. Carroll
*22:57.080- 23:02.680* :  and that he had wanted to defend himself, his family and the presidency. The latter part,
*23:02.680- 23:07.860* :  the judge ordered stricken from the record, but that still didn't stop the former president from
*23:07.860- 23:13.860* :  uttering this is not America from the defense table where he wasn't under oath. Donald Trump
*23:13.860- 23:18.680* :  is testing the limits of the courts in his legal cases, but he is keeping his supporters
*23:18.680- 23:24.500* :  invested and tuned in. And more importantly, he's receiving considerable press coverage as he
*23:24.500- 23:31.240* :  campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination. Nitorthic, next to Brazil, where police have
*23:31.240- 23:38.020* :  raided the home of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro's old spy chief, Alessandro Hamazen.
*23:38.680- 23:43.060* :  Now, a member of Congress, it's part of an investigation into the alleged monitoring of
*23:43.060- 23:48.400* :  thousands of people, including two Supreme Court judges who have seen as hostile to the former
*23:48.400- 23:54.520* :  president. Mr. Hamazen says he's done nothing wrong. Our America's regional editor, Leonardo
*23:54.520- 24:00.660* :  Russia, tell me more. The main focus of the investigation is the former spy chief, the former head
*24:01.080- 24:08.180* :  of the Brazilian intelligence agency, Alessandro Hamazen. So they went into his office, he's now a member
*24:08.180- 24:14.300* :  of Congress. They seized phones and he seized material linked to him. And Brazilian media are also
*24:14.300- 24:19.880* :  reporting that seven current federal police officers have been suspended because they are
*24:19.880- 24:25.920* :  supposed to be involved in these illegal operations. Many times during the Bolsonaro government,
*24:25.920- 24:32.740* :  there were allegations that he was putting the secret services and also the federal police
*24:32.740- 24:37.700* :  and people close to him to his service. Basically, to protect his interests and to protect
*24:37.700- 24:43.360* :  people close to him, including his children. Three of them are politicians. They were being
*24:43.360- 24:48.860* :  investigated. And these are the main allegations that link him to this alleged parallel scheme
*24:49.240- 24:54.340* :  inside the intelligence agency. And what about comments from Mr. Bolsonaro? Have we heard from him?
*24:54.760- 25:00.260* :  No, we haven't heard from him. We have heard from the main person there investigating Mr. Hamazen.
*25:00.260- 25:05.000* :  He said that what they did is they mixed up new information without updates information.
*25:05.000- 25:11.440* :  They made what they called a mix salad of events, you know, put it all together for political
*25:11.440- 25:16.320* :  reasons and they produced a very misleading report. That's what he's saying. He says he's
*25:16.320- 25:21.780* :  hasn't done anything wrong. He's not involved in any illegal activities. And where does this leave
*25:21.780- 25:26.460* :  Mr. Bolsonaro, who's still under multiple investigations, isn't it? It's very bad for him.
*25:26.460- 25:31.400* :  He's been banned from running for office for other reasons, for using public services to
*25:31.400- 25:38.700* :  criticize Brazilian democracy. He's banned from running for office until 2030. But he's a very
*25:38.700- 25:45.300* :  influential figure. He has children who are prominent politicians. And this person, Alexandre Hamazen,
*25:45.700- 25:51.160* :  is still the favorite candidate for, you know, supporter by the Bolsonaro movement to run for
*25:51.160- 25:57.480* :  mayor of real, which is quite an important job. It can be seen as a springboard to test him as
*25:57.480- 26:02.820* :  a possible presidential candidate. He's in a very bad situation. It all looks very bad for Mr.
*26:02.820- 26:07.700* :  Bolsonaro. And there has been the only talking point in Brazil during the day. Leonardo
*26:07.700- 26:13.900* :  Russia. The US technology company Apple has announced that from March, people using its devices
*26:13.900- 26:20.300* :  like iPhones in the European Union will be able to download apps from rival providers and not
*26:20.300- 26:25.700* :  just from its own store, as is currently the case. The decision represents a major U-turn for
*26:25.700- 26:31.100* :  the company. Our technology editor Zoe Klyman reports. You could almost hear the gritting of teeth
*26:31.100- 26:36.460* :  as Apple announced its changes to App Store policies in Europe. The tech giants being forced to
*26:36.460- 26:41.740* :  change its practices following the introduction of new EU rules designed to improve competition.
*26:41.740- 26:47.040* :  Apple has fought strongly against this when challenged in the past. The company's ecosystem
*26:47.040- 26:52.080* :  is sometimes described as a walled garden. This means that only apps which it has approved
*26:52.080- 26:57.120* :  can go onto its devices, and all in-app payments have to be made through its own systems.
*26:57.140- 27:02.380* :  It says this allows it to offer its customers better security, and there is much less malware
*27:02.380- 27:07.220* :  on Apple devices as a result. But developers argue they have no alternative but to jump through
*27:07.220- 27:12.200* :  Apple's hoops and pay its commission fees. Game maker Epic withdrew the app of the hit game
*27:12.200- 27:17.700* :  Fortnite from Apple in 2020 and protest against restrictions. The changes will not currently affect
*27:17.700- 27:22.640* :  the UK, but proposals for similar legislation to the EU are currently making their way through
*27:22.640- 27:29.520* :  Parliament. Zoe Klyman. One of the most ambitious and most expensive space missions ever mounted
*27:29.520- 27:35.020* :  in Europe has just been approved after being in development for decades. The laser into
*27:35.020- 27:41.360* :  ferometer, space and tenor, or Lisa, will try to detect the ripples in the fabric of space that
*27:41.360- 27:47.120* :  are generated when gargantuan so-called black holes collide. Here's our science correspondent Jonathan
*27:47.120- 27:54.340* :  Amos. Lisa is one of the grand scientific endeavours of the 21st century. It'll fly three identical
*27:54.340- 28:00.160* :  spacecraft separated from each other by two and a half million kilometres. Lasers will flash
*28:00.300- 28:05.760* :  between them to pick up the subtle warping of space that occurs when black holes, millions of
*28:05.760- 28:11.980* :  times the mass of our son merge together. To work, the technology will need to sense changes in
*28:11.980- 28:16.620* :  the path of the lasers that are equivalent to just fractions of the diameter of an atom.
*28:17.320- 28:22.820* :  Lisa has already been in development for three decades, and its complexity means it still won't
*28:22.820- 28:29.400* :  be ready to launch until 2035. The total project cost will probably exceed two and a half billion
*28:29.820- 28:35.240* :  dollars. But scientists to convince Lisa's insights on the workings and history of the cosmos will
*28:35.240- 28:42.580* :  be profound. Jonathan Amos. Now, it wasn't your average traffic infringement in Thailand. A woman
*28:42.580- 28:47.820* :  was driving down a busy street in the east of the country. In her luxury open top Bentley car,
*28:47.820- 28:53.920* :  and with her was a lion. In a video of the incident, people on motorbikes can be seen nervously
*28:53.920- 28:59.720* :  passing the animal, which had its head and two paws hanging outside the car, facing into the
*28:59.720- 29:05.500* :  oncoming traffic. Stephanie Prentice told them all. This was taking the roar of traffic to new
*29:05.500- 29:11.220* :  levels. The video of this incident showed a large lion just cruising through the streets. It
*29:11.480- 29:15.840* :  seemed like it was being kept as a pet. When the video was seen, these sort of drives weren't
*29:15.900- 29:19.900* :  out of the ordinary for this household, because there's two passengers in the front seat,
*29:20.160- 29:24.500* :  seemingly not really paying that much attention to the lion. The lion seems relaxed. It's in the
*29:24.500- 29:29.180* :  back seat, the upper half of its body, hanging off side of the car, two big paws on the doors,
*29:29.700- 29:35.520* :  and the motorist going past in the direction, seemingly quite concerned. It was wearing a collar
*29:35.520- 29:39.920* :  and it seemed to be chained in. A woman in the car she's thought to be the owner. She's been
*29:39.920- 29:44.680* :  charged with having an unregistered lion, but virtually not with having one. That's actually
*29:45.100- 29:49.740* :  allowed. And it's relankered man who's in the car too. He's left the country after the video
*29:49.740- 29:55.600* :  of this incident when viral. He's believed to be the lion's supplier and is facing charges as well.
*29:55.880- 30:01.680* :  So having a cat like that is not a problem. Having potentially dangerous big pets is fairly common
*30:01.680- 30:07.220* :  in that region. Well, having a big cat in Thailand is seen by some as a status symbol in Potaya,
*30:07.220- 30:12.040* :  where this line was spotted. There's videos on their local Facebook groups of pet lions actually
*30:12.040- 30:16.940* :  getting loose at night. A man in the area actually keeps two of them as pets and he walks them on
*30:16.940- 30:21.200* :  a lead. And there's people in these forums saying they have to rush to get their children inside
*30:21.200- 30:26.900* :  when they see the lions and concern of what they call a trend in keeping these big cats. But it's
*30:26.900- 30:33.300* :  not just confined there. It's down by the East Coast officials say there are currently 224 lions
*30:33.300- 30:39.120* :  across the country that are legally owned. However, the owners are supposed to keep them in a
*30:39.120- 30:44.380* :  specified location, not just take them out for a drive. And the owner of this particular line
*30:44.380- 30:51.860* :  in the video could now face up to six months in jail. Stephanie Prentice. The American singer songwriter
*30:52.200- 30:59.420* :  Melanie Safga, known globally as Melanie, has died at the age of 76. She emerged from the late
*30:59.420- 31:06.020* :  1996's New York folk scene performing at Woodstock and at one of the earliest Glastonbury festivals
*31:06.020- 31:12.560* :  in 1971, returning to the event 40 years later for an anniversary celebration. Her biggest hit,
*31:12.560- 31:18.380* :  The Jointy Brand New Key, was far from representative of the rest of her more contemplative work.
*31:19.020- 31:23.160* :  Our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson looks back at Melanie's life and career.
*31:29.040- 31:34.000* :  Melanie emerged towards the end of the flower power movement, playing at the Woodstock Festival
*31:34.000- 31:42.660* :  in 1969 as a virtual unknown. Taking the place of the incredible string band,
*31:42.660- 31:48.780* :  who refused to go on in the rain, the audience lit candles during her set. This provided the
*31:48.780- 32:00.400* :  inspiration for her breakthrough hits, lay down candles in the rain. From then on, it became a
*32:00.400- 32:10.680* :  ritual for devoted fans to light candles at her shows. A Rolling Stones cover took Melanie
*32:10.680- 32:16.120* :  into the UK Top 10, but it would be one of her own compositions which became her biggest hit.
*32:22.860- 32:28.180* :  Melanie once explained that she wrote Brand New Key after breaking a 27-day fast by
*32:28.180- 32:34.100* :  guzzling a huge hamburger, and when she finished eating, the song popped into her head. She had
*32:34.100- 32:44.280* :  previously been a vegetarian. In 1976, the Wersels had a UK number one with their
*32:44.280- 32:49.920* :  parody version of the song. Melanie's writing credit meant that she made a fortune.
*32:54.840- 33:01.260* :  Morisy and Miley Cyrus both recorded cover versions of her songs, and Jarvis Cocker was a fan,
*33:01.720- 33:05.580* :  inviting Melanie to play when he hosted the Meltdown Festival.
*33:11.040- 33:15.840* :  That was Colin Patterson on the life of the American singer, songwriter Melanie Serfka,
*33:16.140- 33:19.720* :  known globally as Melanie, who died at the age of 76.
*33:22.780- 33:27.260* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
