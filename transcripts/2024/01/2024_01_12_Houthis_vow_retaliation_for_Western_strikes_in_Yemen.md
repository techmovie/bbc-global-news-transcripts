*01:48.360- 01:53.060* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, we're recording this at 14 hours GMT on Friday, the 12th
*01:53.060- 01:53.640* :  of January.
*01:53.640- 01:58.520* :  The U.S. and Britain carry out strikes on the Houthis in Yemen in response to their attacks
*01:58.520- 02:01.440* :  on shipping in the Red Sea, we look at what it all means.
*02:02.200- 02:06.800* :  Israel makes its case at the International Court of Justice, rejecting the accusation that
*02:06.800- 02:11.760* :  it's committing genocide in Gaza, and China steps into broke a deal between Myanmar's
*02:11.760- 02:15.700* :  ruling military and armed rebel groups who've been taking territory in the North.
*02:17.920- 02:23.320* :  So in the podcast, the vast structure in space challenging our understanding of the universe.
*02:23.680- 02:29.760* :  This big ring is 1.3 billion light years across, so this is almost the equivalent of looking
*02:29.800- 02:32.340* :  at 15 full moons lined up.
*02:32.740- 02:36.860* :  And at the moment, I think I've got it on my face, so if you just pop into the camera,
*02:36.860- 02:38.400* :  you'll see that you actually...
*02:38.400- 02:40.140* :  So I could be you, right now, yeah.
*02:40.780- 02:43.420* :  How deep fakes could threaten our security.
*02:47.500- 02:52.920* :  Since November, the Houthis in Yemen have attacked at least 27 ships in the Red Sea, an
*02:52.920- 02:54.680* :  average of one every two days.
*02:55.360- 02:58.900* :  They say they're acting in response to Israeli military action in Gaza.
*02:59.320- 03:03.340* :  But the Houthi threat has disrupted the key trade route via the Suez Canal.
*03:04.040- 03:08.480* :  An international coalition led by the U.S. had tried to protect shipping in the area,
*03:08.920- 03:11.860* :  but to no avail, Thursday saw the worst attack yet.
*03:12.620- 03:17.520* :  And so American and British forces have now carried out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.
*03:25.080- 03:30.460* :  British military footage showed jets and a tanker aircraft taking off from an airbase in Cyprus.
*03:31.180- 03:34.560* :  A Houthi official said five people had been killed in Yemen.
*03:34.620- 03:39.400* :  But the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said he had no choice but to join the U.S.
*03:39.400- 03:41.140* :  in striking Houthi targets in Yemen.
*03:41.760- 03:47.860* :  Our aim is very clear, it's to de-escalate tensions and to restore stability to the region.
*03:48.180- 03:52.740* :  That's why allies over the past few weeks have issued several statements of condemnation
*03:52.740- 03:55.420* :  of what's happening, calling on the Houthis to desist.
*03:55.420- 04:00.740* :  Indeed, just this week we've seen a UN Security Council resolution condemning what's happening
*04:00.740- 04:02.800* :  and saying the states have a right to self-defense.
*04:02.800- 04:08.100* :  We have acted in self-defense, it's incumbent now on the Houthis to stop carrying out these
*04:08.100- 04:11.300* :  attacks, putting people's lives at risk and disrupting the global economy, which is
*04:11.300- 04:15.020* :  also have a damaging impact on people's day-to-day lives.
*04:15.020- 04:15.640* :  That's not right.
*04:15.700- 04:19.040* :  We've seen the disruption that that's brought over the past year or two with the situation
*04:19.340- 04:20.040* :  in Russia and Ukraine.
*04:20.040- 04:22.840* :  We don't want to see that happen again, and that's why it's right that we've taken action.
*04:23.280- 04:25.620* :  Rishi Sunak speaking on a visit to Ukraine.
*04:25.620- 04:30.500* :  For his part, U.S. President Joe Biden said the air strikes were supported by Australia,
*04:30.500- 04:32.460* :  Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
*04:33.060- 04:38.120* :  But they've been criticized by Russia, China and Iran, even Saudi Arabia, which has been
*04:38.120- 04:42.900* :  fighting the Houthis for years, so it was concerned about the possibility of an escalation.
*04:43.380- 04:49.140* :  The Houthi military spokesman Yaya Saria warned the U.S. and Britain would face retaliation.
*04:51.820- 04:57.160* :  The American and British enemies bear full responsibility for their criminal aggression
*04:57.160- 04:58.840* :  against our Yemeni people.
*04:59.220- 05:02.360* :  It will not go unpunished or unanswered.
*05:02.480- 05:08.660* :  The Yemeni armed forces will not hesitate to target all threats and all hostile targets
*05:08.660- 05:14.360* :  on land and sea in order to defend Yemen, its sovereignty and its independence.
*05:15.100- 05:19.000* :  For more details on what was attacked in Yemen, I spoke to our security correspondent,
*05:19.020- 05:20.080* :  Frank Gardner.
*05:20.660- 05:26.860* :  There have been a total of 60 targets in 16 sites in the main cities of Sanaa, the capital,
*05:26.860- 05:32.120* :  Hadeidah, with the main port on the Red Sea, the Mar and a number of other places.
*05:32.700- 05:37.920* :  So far more extensive, I have to say, than what most people have predicted, it was thought
*05:37.920- 05:41.960* :  that if and when these air strikes went in that they would properly try and hit simply
*05:41.960- 05:46.320* :  coastal defenses, possibly going for some radar sites, but they seem to have been pretty
*05:46.920- 05:46.940* :  extensive.
*05:47.240- 05:52.420* :  I mean, there's no question that the U.S.-led coalition has obviously got pretty good intelligence
*05:52.640- 05:55.100* :  on the nature of the Houthi sites.
*05:55.120- 06:01.640* :  They've hit missile storage sites, airfields, radar bases, even some command and control
*06:01.640- 06:02.120* :  centers.
*06:02.220- 06:06.540* :  The casualties seems to have been very light, which I'm sure is deliberate because what
*06:06.540- 06:11.980* :  the U.S.-led coalition is looking to do is essentially to deter the Houthis from any
*06:11.980- 06:16.820* :  further attacks on shipping, rather than inflicting massive damage on them or on Yemen.
*06:16.820- 06:21.400* :  I mean, don't forget this is a country that has already emerging from eight years of
*06:21.400- 06:24.540* :  civil war, with over 150,000 people killed.
*06:24.800- 06:29.000* :  So the last thing it needs is another conflict, but the Houthis have brought this on themselves
*06:29.000- 06:33.720* :  by attacking shipping, and they don't really seem to be showing any signs of letting
*06:33.780- 06:34.020* :  up.
*06:34.440- 06:38.880* :  Will these series of air strikes help protect shipping going forward?
*06:39.120- 06:40.260* :  It doesn't look like it.
*06:40.260- 06:42.540* :  They have vowed to continue their attacks.
*06:42.740- 06:47.500* :  The way the Houthis present themselves is that they are part of the Iranian-backed
*06:47.500- 06:52.740* :  axis of resistance that they are helping to protect and defend their brothers in Palestine
*06:53.420- 06:54.200* :  as they put it.
*06:54.640- 06:58.320* :  And they see Israel as the adversary, the shipping they are attacking.
*06:58.320- 07:00.620* :  They say has all got Israeli links.
*07:01.060- 07:02.060* :  That isn't actually true.
*07:02.060- 07:05.000* :  They've attacked a number of ships that have got no connection to Israel.
*07:05.000- 07:09.880* :  But the point being that the global trade and shipping and container shipping community
*07:09.880- 07:15.740* :  has been asking for the U.S.-led coalition to do something about this because it's forcing
*07:15.740- 07:21.880* :  ships to go right around the other side of Africa, adding an extra 3,000 miles, 5,000 kilometers,
*07:22.280- 07:27.240* :  seven days of transit time for shipping that's going between Europe and the Far East, for
*07:27.240- 07:28.460* :  example, Southeast Asia.
*07:28.800- 07:34.580* :  So clearly something had to be done, but inevitably this will have raised tensions, and I think
*07:34.580- 07:37.880* :  the way the Houthis will present this and the way probably much of them at least will
*07:37.880- 07:43.820* :  see this is an extension of the Gaza war, which is very much not what the U.S. and the
*07:44.120- 07:45.360* :  UK want it to be seen as.
*07:45.360- 07:47.240* :  They're saying, no, this is a separate issue.
*07:47.240- 07:51.120* :  This is unprovoked attacks on shipping, which we have dealt with.
*07:51.420- 07:54.200* :  But there's no indication that this is going to be the end of it.
*07:54.780- 07:58.560* :  I think the Houthis are going to probably try and show that they are resilient in the face
*07:58.560- 07:59.200* :  of these attacks.
*07:59.740- 08:03.840* :  Yeah, the Houthis say the U.S. and Britain will pay a heavy price.
*08:03.860- 08:05.260* :  How could they respond?
*08:05.880- 08:10.620* :  Well, the most obvious way is by doing a repeat of what they did on Tuesday, where they
*08:10.620- 08:16.360* :  mounted a complex mass attack, which was repelled by U.S. and Western warships.
*08:16.360- 08:21.780* :  But they launched a combination of 21 drones, anti-ballistic missiles and cruise missiles
*08:22.120- 08:23.520* :  at Western warships now.
*08:23.520- 08:29.280* :  If they were to do that, times three, there is a risk to Western warships that I think
*08:29.280- 08:31.300* :  it could overwhelm their air defenses.
*08:31.680- 08:36.520* :  In the case of Idramis Diamond, the Royal Navy destroyer guided missile destroyer that
*08:36.520- 08:38.400* :  is in the Red Sea.
*08:38.620- 08:44.640* :  That had to deploy one of its close-in weapons, a 30mm early-con machine gun, to destroy incoming
*08:44.700- 08:45.680* :  ordnance.
*08:45.960- 08:51.340* :  So, that's really a kind of last-ditch weapon when your missiles no longer are effective,
*08:51.900- 08:52.980* :  you use a machine gun.
*08:53.180- 08:57.560* :  And the Houthis, I think, would probably try to do something similar to to score a hit
*08:57.560- 08:58.820* :  on a Western warship.
*08:59.260- 09:03.960* :  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, well, as we heard, many companies shipping goods
*09:03.960- 09:08.080* :  between Europe and Asia are being forced to take the longer route around the southern
*09:08.080- 09:08.960* :  tip of Africa.
*09:09.640- 09:13.760* :  And the price of oil is also up 4% as a result of the attacks.
*09:14.420- 09:19.460* :  The boss of the shipping giant Merck, Vincent Clark, warned that it could all affect consumers.
*09:20.140- 09:25.620* :  This is impacting all the goods from medicine to food to anything that you would find in
*09:25.620- 09:26.540* :  a supermarket shelf.
*09:27.080- 09:29.820* :  Shipping prices have shot up as a result.
*09:30.400- 09:35.200* :  So, you see already that some of the costs is starting to percolate all the way down
*09:35.200- 09:38.740* :  to the end consumer, which in these times of inflation is really something that we need
*09:38.740- 09:39.480* :  to track to avoid.
*09:39.900- 09:44.080* :  No, for more on what it means for firms and their customers, I spoke to our business correspondent
*09:44.120- 09:45.040* :  Will Bain.
*09:45.460- 09:49.020* :  You use this phrase, Ollie, and I think the right one, that this is a choke point in
*09:49.020- 09:49.720* :  global shipping.
*09:49.720- 09:54.220* :  I mean, this is a choke point on a key artery, I mean, an artery that literally keeps the global
*09:54.220- 09:55.180* :  economy going.
*09:55.180- 09:59.660* :  And Vincent Clark, there, talking about goods, sure, lots of those come through this route.
*09:59.700- 10:04.060* :  But everything else, too, food, stuff, energy, and already today on global markets, we're
*10:04.080- 10:07.640* :  seeing, for example, the price of oil spiking up, the price of natural gas going up.
*10:08.000- 10:12.640* :  So the longer that there is pressure on that choke point, then you are going to see it
*10:12.640- 10:14.620* :  start dripping into everything we buy.
*10:14.900- 10:20.720* :  Yeah, I mean, we also saw Iran, the season, oil tanker near Amman in the early hours of
*10:20.860- 10:25.280* :  Thursday, our shipping companies having to rethink their whole business models because
*10:25.280- 10:26.080* :  of all this disrupt.
*10:26.160- 10:26.720* :  Yeah, completely.
*10:26.920- 10:30.980* :  They added costs and not just that longer route, if they choose to do it as you were
*10:31.200- 10:34.740* :  online, but it's also things like insurance, for example, or extra security.
*10:34.740- 10:39.440* :  A lot of them are putting private security personnel on these ships now to try and protect
*10:39.440- 10:40.000* :  their crews.
*10:40.060- 10:42.980* :  And some of outright said that they're just not going to sell this route.
*10:42.980- 10:45.980* :  One of the biggest haphagloid I've said in the last couple of days, they just won't
*10:45.980- 10:49.820* :  put their crews and ships at risk, but it does mean, of course, more fuel, you're paying
*10:49.820- 10:52.740* :  more wages, if it takes you twice as many days to get it there.
*10:53.120- 10:56.660* :  And then it has an impact on your end consumer, you know, do they think you're breaching
*10:56.660- 10:57.240* :  your contract?
*10:57.240- 11:00.320* :  And they want to charge you more or end the terms of that contract.
*11:00.320- 11:03.520* :  And we're seeing it with the biggest companies on the planet, Oli and the smallest, I was
*11:03.520- 11:05.860* :  talking to a tiny furniture manufacturer in the UK.
*11:06.260- 11:10.520* :  She's being affected, but also we saw Tesla shutting down production in Germany overnight
*11:10.520- 11:11.240* :  as well because of this.
*11:11.240- 11:15.540* :  So having an impact on businesses big and small business correspondent, Will Bane, other
*11:15.540- 11:16.020* :  news now.
*11:16.100- 11:20.500* :  And on the podcast this time yesterday, we reported on South Africa opening a case at
*11:20.500- 11:25.100* :  the international court of justice, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.
*11:25.400- 11:30.140* :  Today, the Israelis are giving their response, addressing the court for legal adviser to
*11:30.140- 11:35.280* :  Israel's justice ministry, Gallet at Ragoan, acknowledged that there were civilian casualties
*11:35.280- 11:38.820* :  in Gaza, but firmly rejected the accusation of genocide.
*11:38.980- 11:45.340* :  Urban warfare will always result in tragic deaths, harm and damage.
*11:46.000- 11:51.960* :  But in Gaza, these undesired outcomes are exacerbated because they are the desired outcomes
*11:52.360- 11:53.080* :  of Hamas.
*11:53.640- 12:00.600* :  In urban warfare, civilian casualties may be the unintended but lawful result of attacks
*12:00.600- 12:03.220* :  on lawfully military objectives.
*12:04.300- 12:10.020* :  International humanitarian law recognizes this reality and provides a framework for balancing
*12:10.020- 12:13.260* :  military necessity with humanitarian considerations.
*12:14.220- 12:18.220* :  These do not constitute genocidal acts.
*12:18.820- 12:22.380* :  And I heard more of my correspondent at the court in the Hague, Anaholegan.
*12:23.320- 12:31.640* :  It really lawyers accuse South Africa of trivializing and making light of the genocide convention
*12:31.640- 12:32.680* :  weaponizing.
*12:32.680- 12:37.800* :  They said the term genocide, we've just come outside court, the hearings have ended.
*12:37.860- 12:42.060* :  You might be able to hear some of the people supporting the Palestinians in the background.
*12:42.260- 12:47.120* :  So Israel ran through a series of arguments, basically dismissing everything we heard from
*12:47.120- 12:47.640* :  South Africa.
*12:48.260- 12:54.120* :  They talked about statements that senior Israeli politicians had made which they said did
*12:54.120- 12:57.140* :  not constitute any form of genocidal intent.
*12:57.740- 13:04.260* :  They also talked about efforts to move Palestinians out of harm's way, so dropping leaflets, asking
*13:04.260- 13:08.180* :  people to travel to the South, and they said this wasn't about a forced displacement.
*13:08.180- 13:10.660* :  It was about protecting civilian lives.
*13:11.140- 13:14.260* :  The Israelis showed a number of images in court.
*13:14.260- 13:20.400* :  They said they were responding to the seventh of October, Hamas attacks, which they described
*13:20.400- 13:26.060* :  as the biggest calculated mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust.
*13:26.060- 13:32.940* :  And in these images, they showed alleged launch sites of Hamas militants, including in hospitals
*13:32.940- 13:34.400* :  and children's bedrooms.
*13:34.400- 13:38.720* :  So essentially, Israel has been arguing it's acting in self-defense in line with international
*13:38.780- 13:43.100* :  humanitarian law targeting Hamas rather than Palestinians themselves.
*13:43.100- 13:47.340* :  So this, they say, cannot be understood to be any form of genocide.
*13:47.860- 13:49.220* :  Anaholegan in the hake.
*13:49.760- 13:55.220* :  Turning to space now, and a British PhD student has discovered a ring shaped structure more
*13:55.220- 13:56.900* :  than a billion light years across.
*13:57.380- 14:01.940* :  Alexei Lopez, an observational cosmologist, presented her work at a conference in New Orleans.
*14:01.940- 14:04.580* :  She's been speaking to the BBC's Michelle Hussein.
*14:05.240- 14:07.660* :  When I first started my masters by research,
*14:07.900- 14:13.300* :  I was working on a new technique of mapping large-scale structures in the universe.
*14:13.980- 14:17.140* :  So I was actually just testing the method first.
*14:17.680- 14:20.660* :  And so I selected a few different test fields.
*14:21.000- 14:26.080* :  There was this one particular test field that when I was looking with this new method,
*14:26.840- 14:34.480* :  I saw this interest in dense arc of contours that were telling me there was this mass enhancement.
*14:35.320- 14:38.180* :  So this ultimately led to the giant arc discovery.
*14:38.540- 14:40.300* :  Now, all of that work was done.
*14:40.300- 14:41.380* :  The paper was published.
*14:41.380- 14:43.320* :  That was all done a few years ago.
*14:44.000- 14:46.700* :  And then I started using the newest data release.
*14:46.980- 14:50.400* :  So the first thing I thought to do was, okay, I'm using this new data.
*14:50.400- 14:52.360* :  So let me just have a look at the giant arc.
*14:52.580- 14:55.580* :  What I wasn't expecting to see was that in the same field,
*14:55.580- 14:59.620* :  there was this interesting ring structure slightly to the north of it.
*14:59.880- 15:02.900* :  And that's when I slightly changed my field of view.
*15:03.080- 15:07.720* :  I moved up to the big ring and they'll start at the analysis for this structure.
*15:08.180- 15:09.520* :  And it really is big, isn't it?
*15:09.520- 15:12.940* :  Give us a sense of the scale of it and why that is so unprecedented.
*15:13.620- 15:17.000* :  This big ring is 1.3 billion light years across.
*15:17.000- 15:20.620* :  So if we were to think of that as in looking at the night sky,
*15:21.360- 15:24.280* :  that would mean it's about roughly eight degrees across.
*15:24.380- 15:29.940* :  So this is almost the equivalent of looking at 15 full moons lined up.
*15:30.540- 15:32.040* :  So when you're looking at it in the sky,
*15:32.040- 15:35.180* :  it's on the scale of the size of these constellations.
*15:35.300- 15:38.100* :  So it's actually huge in the sky.
*15:38.700- 15:42.640* :  It would also have a diameter of 4.1 billion light years.
*15:43.260- 15:46.820* :  And bearing in mind, from here to the edge of the observable universe,
*15:46.820- 15:48.640* :  it's 45 billion light years.
*15:48.640- 15:54.120* :  It's a fraction of this radius from us to the edge of our observable universe.
*15:54.120- 15:56.120* :  So these structures are huge.
*15:56.520- 15:58.600* :  What is it like to discover something like this,
*15:58.600- 16:01.000* :  while you're still studying for your PhD?
*16:01.480- 16:04.600* :  It's both an amazing thrilling experience
*16:04.600- 16:07.440* :  and it's also terribly daunting.
*16:07.440- 16:13.300* :  Just being very, very aware of I am at the beginning of my academic career.
*16:13.920- 16:17.380* :  So compared to the academic giants out there,
*16:17.380- 16:20.440* :  I'm so aware of I don't have the expertise.
*16:21.160- 16:24.120* :  And so when these academic people are saying to me,
*16:24.140- 16:24.920* :  wow, this is great.
*16:24.920- 16:25.880* :  This is a great discovery.
*16:26.320- 16:28.180* :  I feel so out of place,
*16:28.180- 16:31.680* :  but also it's an amazing privileged feeling,
*16:31.680- 16:33.840* :  but it's also very, very scary.
*16:35.000- 16:37.920* :  Alexiela Pez from the University of Central Lancashire.
*16:39.780- 16:41.740* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast.

*16:57.260- 16:59.540* :  For more fever in Ivory Coast,
*16:59.540- 17:02.000* :  as it prepares to host the African Cup of Nations.
*17:05.220- 17:07.880* :  A web of manipulation and terrifying abuse.
*17:08.160- 17:10.800* :  If you'd have said to do anything, I would have done it.
*17:10.940- 17:13.180* :  With a powerful religious figure at its centre.
*17:13.500- 17:14.800* :  There was no safe place.
*17:15.140- 17:16.540* :  You don't say no to him.

*18:16.980- 18:19.300* :  abdication of Denmark's Queen Magrater
*18:19.620- 18:23.240* :  and the country's new King mean for all of Europe's royal families.
*18:23.940- 18:27.100* :  The global story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives

*18:40.680- 18:43.000* :  Since it seized power nearly three years ago,
*18:43.000- 18:46.640* :  the military junta in Myanmar has been opposed by a range of forces,
*18:47.320- 18:49.620* :  but it has always managed to maintain control.
*18:50.100- 18:51.940* :  However, over the past three months,
*18:51.940- 18:54.340* :  it's faced its biggest challenge yet,
*18:54.820- 18:57.720* :  in the form of an offensive by an alliance of rebel groups
*18:57.720- 18:59.620* :  known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance.
*19:00.300- 19:03.460* :  They recently captured a town on the northern border with China,
*19:03.460- 19:06.480* :  prompting Beijing to step in and broke a truce.
*19:06.960- 19:08.900* :  So is this a win for the Brotherhood Alliance?
*19:08.940- 19:12.300* :  I asked our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head.
*19:12.880- 19:15.280* :  I think the rebels are quite happy to hold on to what they've got,
*19:15.320- 19:19.540* :  and they've made these extraordinary sweeping gains over the last two and a half months
*19:19.540- 19:22.660* :  at the expense of Myanmar military positions, which have just crumbled.
*19:23.200- 19:26.740* :  They now, in effect, control nearly all of the commercially viable parts
*19:26.740- 19:28.420* :  of the Myanmar Chinese border.
*19:28.880- 19:30.820* :  So the ceasefire is something China wants,
*19:30.840- 19:32.820* :  because it wants trade to resume.
*19:33.240- 19:34.540* :  It wants peace on its border.
*19:34.820- 19:36.940* :  The province of Yunnan in southwestern China
*19:37.380- 19:38.680* :  depends a lot on trade with Myanmar,
*19:38.680- 19:39.920* :  so it's very important to them.
*19:40.220- 19:42.220* :  And that's what they've got, a ceasefire.
*19:42.480- 19:46.680* :  It appears as part of that the Myanmar military hunter has agreed to stop
*19:46.680- 19:49.120* :  bombing positions that the rebels have taken.
*19:49.160- 19:51.760* :  There's been very heavy bombardment from the air and a lot of damage
*19:51.760- 19:54.340* :  to towns, which are now in insurgent hands.
*19:54.820- 19:56.380* :  We don't know when trade will resume.
*19:56.380- 20:01.760* :  What has not been agreed is where the final territorial boundaries will be.
*20:02.200- 20:04.340* :  The Myanmar military has been badly humiliated.
*20:04.340- 20:07.780* :  The Kool-eater General Minon Line has lost a huge amount of credibility,
*20:07.780- 20:10.920* :  probably even among his own core supporters inside the hunter,
*20:11.360- 20:13.120* :  through the very poor performance of the military.
*20:13.120- 20:16.020* :  And they, at these talks, the Myanmar military has been demanding
*20:16.460- 20:18.420* :  a return of those territories that it's lost.
*20:18.420- 20:19.620* :  He's already quite extensive.
*20:20.080- 20:22.260* :  These rebel groups are absolutely not ready to do that.
*20:22.560- 20:23.900* :  I mean, it strengthens their position.
*20:24.360- 20:27.460* :  They're looking forward to a future where maybe there isn't a military government
*20:27.460- 20:30.080* :  or where there will be a new federal settlement,
*20:30.080- 20:31.620* :  and the stronger these groups are,
*20:31.980- 20:33.700* :  the better deal they think they'll get under that.
*20:33.700- 20:35.820* :  So it is only a ceasefire at this stage,
*20:35.820- 20:37.720* :  and it's quite likely to be fairly tense
*20:37.720- 20:39.640* :  with the possibility of conflict resuming.
*20:39.860- 20:41.460* :  Yeah, I was going to ask Will it hold,
*20:41.480- 20:43.500* :  given the rebels will want to push on
*20:43.500- 20:46.120* :  and the military junta will want to get its territory back?
*20:46.440- 20:49.060* :  I'm not sure what capacity the Myanmar military has
*20:49.540- 20:51.180* :  for fighting to get that territory back.
*20:51.500- 20:56.120* :  It's been very striking to see how many units have simply surrendered without fighting,
*20:56.640- 20:59.640* :  and how many of those units don't have frontline combat troops.
*21:00.080- 21:02.200* :  I think the Myanmar military is badly overstretched,
*21:02.560- 21:05.660* :  and I think these insurgent groups feel they've done very well.
*21:05.660- 21:08.640* :  The real question is, will this encourage other groups
*21:08.640- 21:10.640* :  opposing the military to fight much harder?
*21:10.800- 21:13.060* :  They've been encouraged, but do they have the capacity?
*21:13.060- 21:15.060* :  It might change the dynamics of this war.
*21:15.420- 21:17.020* :  Jonathan Ed, on events in Myanmar.
*21:17.600- 21:21.240* :  Well, it was a shocking moment broadcast live on television,
*21:21.240- 21:24.320* :  an armed gang taking over a TV studio in Ecuador,
*21:24.320- 21:27.400* :  threatening staff and holding a presenter at gunpoint.
*21:28.080- 21:32.120* :  The U.S. State Department has now confirmed it's sending a top U.S. military officer
*21:32.120- 21:35.540* :  and several senior officials to the South American country
*21:35.980- 21:40.020* :  to support President Daniel Naboa in his fight against the country's drugs gangs.
*21:40.860- 21:43.600* :  Some of the worst violence in Ecuador has been taking place
*21:43.600- 21:48.380* :  in the port city of Guayaquil from where our correspondent Will Grant sent this report.
*21:52.880- 21:57.300* :  Diego Guyardo, known by his artistic name Aire Del Golfo,
*21:57.500- 21:59.700* :  was one of Guayaquil's best love musicians.
*22:00.760- 22:03.160* :  Young, talented and proudly Ecuadorian,
*22:03.160- 22:09.320* :  his music, called Troppy Pop, spoke of the melancholy and beauty of this complex Andean nation.
*22:14.140- 22:16.920* :  The lyrics of this song are about staying on your feet
*22:16.980- 22:21.900* :  no matter what's thrown at you, something which resonated with his fans across the country.
*22:22.720- 22:27.720* :  tragically, Aire Del Golfo was a victim of the gang violence which gripped Guayaquil this week.
*22:27.720- 22:32.440* :  He was caught in the crossfire as he went to pick up his son from school amid the chaos.
*22:34.740- 22:36.480* :  In fact, I was going to go to collect him.
*22:36.800- 22:38.560* :  But as I was heading to the car, he said no.
*22:38.940- 22:41.740* :  The children can live without me, but they can't live without their mother.
*22:43.160- 22:46.660* :  Diego Guyardo's widow, Camille Gamara, is also an artist.
*22:46.660- 22:52.600* :  She said her husband was a hero twice over for his actions to protect their child that day.
*22:53.580- 22:58.340* :  My eldest child isn't his biological son, and he displayed the death of his love because
*22:58.580- 23:00.200* :  he loved him with his whole heart.
*23:00.460- 23:03.060* :  To the point that he's prepared to give up his life to protect him,
*23:03.300- 23:05.840* :  for me it's brave enough to bring up a child that isn't yours,
*23:06.340- 23:08.520* :  and twice it's brave to risk a life for someone.
*23:09.380- 23:14.620* :  It says a lot about his character, who's always ready to give everything to everyone, not just family.
*23:18.840- 23:23.300* :  After the bloodshed, the city has been trying to return to something resembling normal.
*23:24.280- 23:29.080* :  I'm in Lavailla, a huge cupboard market in the centre of Guayaquil,
*23:29.580- 23:36.060* :  made up of some 6,000 little stalls selling everything from counterfeit football jerseys and
*23:36.060- 23:39.240* :  mobile phone covers to toys and street food.
*23:39.620- 23:43.820* :  But I am also walking past dozens that continue to have their shutters down,
*23:43.820- 23:49.800* :  their owners no doubt frightened that the wave of violence that's gripped this city isn't over yet.
*23:53.780- 23:56.420* :  For some families, though, the ordeal never let up.
*23:57.120- 24:00.420* :  The power base of Ecuador's gangs is inside the prison system.
*24:01.120- 24:07.060* :  Unverified videos circulating online claims to show some of the around 180 prison officers
*24:07.060- 24:10.400* :  being held hostage by the gangs inside the jails.
*24:10.720- 24:12.220* :  Their relatives are growing desperate.
*24:12.640- 24:15.940* :  Diego Adonius, head of Ecuador's Prison Workers Association,
*24:15.940- 24:19.380* :  had some sharp criticism for the government's handling of the crisis.
*24:20.060- 24:25.060* :  As the prison security force, we've had to, and excuse my language,
*24:25.600- 24:28.560* :  prostitute ourselves between institution and institution,
*24:28.560- 24:31.380* :  between the ministries in search of funding and direction.
*24:32.100- 24:35.140* :  Sadly, none of them have known how to run the prison service,
*24:35.520- 24:38.500* :  wherewithout logistics, without kit, there's no uniforms,
*24:38.500- 24:41.020* :  there's not protective gear, there's no strategy.
*24:46.080- 24:48.380* :  The government says the country is in a state of war.
*24:48.940- 24:53.200* :  Hundreds have been arrested and raids or detained on the street since the crisis began.
*24:53.900- 24:55.760* :  Despite the plight of the kidnapped guards,
*24:55.760- 24:58.140* :  this is not a time to cede to the gangs.
*24:58.340- 25:00.700* :  The administration of President Nobóra insists.
*25:06.140- 25:08.940* :  As the eagle guy Adonius family prepares for his funeral,
*25:08.940- 25:12.060* :  his music will be his legacy to his conflicted city.
*25:12.560- 25:17.560* :  He took his name, I did El Golfor, from the air which blows through the Gulf of Guayakil.
*25:18.340- 25:23.620* :  It is an air which today hangs heavy with a threat of more violence and more bloodshed to come.
*25:30.040- 25:31.680* :  A report by Will Grant.
*25:32.780- 25:36.880* :  Ivory Coast is preparing to host the Africa Cup of Nations for a second time.
*25:36.880- 25:41.640* :  A country which suffered a civil war just over a decade ago has produced some of Africa's
*25:41.640- 25:46.540* :  greatest players of recent times, including Didier Drogba and Yaya Torre.
*25:46.860- 25:50.420* :  And these football fans in Abijón can't wait for the tournament to kick off.
*25:52.720- 25:55.000* :  We are going to organize the best nations' Cup ever.
*26:02.660- 26:06.200* :  I'm very excited, it can demonstrate to all that,
*26:06.200- 26:11.920* :  I very cost it's a very, very big nation and organized this type of event.
*26:12.460- 26:13.240* :  It's like powerful.
*26:14.080- 26:15.600* :  We can show them everything.
*26:15.600- 26:19.100* :  We'll be able to show off some of the country's assets.
*26:19.700- 26:21.100* :  It won't just be Abijón.
*26:21.520- 26:24.820* :  They'll see all the beautiful things Abijón has to offer.
*26:25.840- 26:31.000* :  Since the conflict ended Ivory Coast has also become a growing financial power in West Africa.
*26:31.700- 26:36.940* :  So could the Cup of Nations football further fuel its journey from political turmoil to economic triumph?
*26:36.940- 26:40.700* :  BBC Sport Africa's Ian Williams reports from Abijón.
*26:44.940- 26:49.540* :  Like many African countries, football is big business in Ivory Coast.
*26:49.540- 26:56.320* :  The Ivorian government has spent at least a billion dollars preparing for the 24-team competition.
*26:56.320- 27:01.540* :  With the West Africans looking to boost the economy while serving up a feast of football.
*27:05.500- 27:10.760* :  The lunchtime rush is on at one of Acuba Angola's restaurants in Abijón.
*27:11.220- 27:14.300* :  She founded a fast food chain in 2021.
*27:15.040- 27:21.420* :  The Cup of Nations coming in Ivory Coast is a very great opportunity for business
*27:22.040- 27:27.440* :  because we have many people coming from over a country that discover what we are doing in Ivory Coast.
*27:32.080- 27:37.220* :  Civil wars brutalized Ivory Coast between 2002 and 2011.
*27:37.800- 27:41.760* :  But today's stability means many people have returned in recent years.
*27:42.200- 27:47.120* :  And now Ivorians are hoping to achieve both on and off the pitch, an Afcon.
*27:50.300- 27:52.680* :  The Nations Cup will be held in five cities.
*27:53.200- 27:56.720* :  At the University of Alessandro Watchera, Proud Yao's Seraphane,
*27:57.000- 28:02.020* :  a professor of economics told me why he believes the benefits will be spread around.
*28:02.520- 28:03.320* :  What is our flu?
*28:04.780- 28:12.160* :  There will be an influx of supporters to Corjo, Sun Pedro, Boake, and Yamusukru.
*28:12.440- 28:19.280* :  So the hotels will be packed, traders will gain in terms of resources, and it will also create
*28:19.280- 28:25.800* :  growth centers. Since the Civil War ended and thanks to major investments and the
*28:25.800- 28:30.980* :  strong showing of key commodities, cocoa and coffee, the Ivorian economy looks
*28:30.980- 28:36.540* :  set to become West Africa's second largest overtaking Ghana, but still some way behind Nigeria.
*28:37.080- 28:39.200* :  Professor Seraphane still has some fears though.
*28:42.300- 28:47.820* :  If we are not careful and if we don't think about creating events that will be able to
*28:47.820- 28:55.400* :  boost revenues from our stadiums, I fear that the country of elephants will produce white elephants.
*28:56.000- 29:01.140* :  So there are concerns, but also many opportunities, as Ivory Coast looks to make a noise,
*29:01.640- 29:03.560* :  during Africa's biggest sporting events.
*29:05.920- 29:10.580* :  Ian Williams in Ivory Coast ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations starting on Saturday.
*29:11.740- 29:16.540* :  The days of having to remember hundreds of different passwords could soon be a thing of the past,
*29:17.020- 29:20.920* :  as firms like Google introduced the use of past keys as a default login,
*29:21.580- 29:27.340* :  but with the rise of deep-fake technology, is any method of verifying our identities completely secure?
*29:28.080- 29:32.360* :  Our cyber-correspondent Joe Tide has been investigating with some surprising results.
*29:33.420- 29:35.100* :  How safe is your face?
*29:35.620- 29:37.000* :  Now we're inside the food lab.
*29:37.280- 29:42.020* :  At online identity experts on Fido, they ask this question every day.
*29:42.420- 29:47.340* :  Surrounded by an impressive collection of different types of masks, Simon Haweswell tries to
*29:47.340- 29:53.280* :  think like a criminal and trick online facial ID systems used to verify customers on the apps
*29:53.280- 29:55.580* :  of large companies, including banks.
*29:55.780- 30:00.520* :  These masks, as you can see, they vary in quality, and the trick there is some of them might look
*30:00.520- 30:06.160* :  similar to the person that's on the document. But what we found increasingly over last few years
*30:06.160- 30:10.480* :  certainly is that we found more and more what I would call professional fraudsters.
*30:10.880- 30:13.960* :  They've started using deep-fakes in the biometric side of it.
*30:14.080- 30:15.220* :  Can I have a look at some of the...
*30:15.360- 30:16.600* :  Sure, but I'll read it for you.
*30:17.060- 30:21.720* :  So it's at the moment, I think I've got it on my face, so if you just pop into the camera,
*30:21.720- 30:23.140* :  you'll see that you actually...
*30:23.140- 30:23.660* :  So I could be...
*30:23.940- 30:25.000* :  You were... Right now, yeah.
*30:25.800- 30:29.940* :  Within a second, my face, as seen on the camera, switches to Simon's.
*30:30.280- 30:31.280* :  Yep, that's my smile.
*30:31.700- 30:35.980* :  Now, I could do as well, because you sent us a single front-on shot,
*30:36.260- 30:38.180* :  and again, the season from the video you sent...
*30:38.180- 30:40.200* :  Oh, okay, just a still picture.
*30:40.420- 30:43.640* :  Yep, and I could have done this from an image on the internet, and now we're both you.
*30:44.820- 30:48.720* :  At the moment, fraud experts like Simon are able to pick up on fakes,
*30:48.980- 30:51.560* :  but things are about to get a whole lot busier for people like him,
*30:51.560- 30:56.780* :  as the world is moving rapidly towards a new technology that uses face ID and other methods
*30:56.780- 30:58.720* :  to protect our lives online.
*30:58.720- 31:02.420* :  The new system is all the rage in tech keynote presentations.
*31:02.540- 31:05.900* :  Pasky. Pasky. Pasky. Pasky. Pasky. Pasky.
*31:06.100- 31:08.520* :  So what are Paskies and why are they the future?
*31:09.080- 31:11.180* :  If you think of an online login as a door,
*31:11.440- 31:14.180* :  the current system of passwords is like a code.
*31:15.320- 31:17.300* :  As long as someone has it, they can get in.
*31:17.700- 31:21.940* :  A Pasky is like a dormant, checking your code and your ID pass.
*31:22.300- 31:26.200* :  Online services use your phone or computer to verify who you are,
*31:26.200- 31:29.480* :  with a thumbprint, facial ID, or the unlock code.
*31:29.920- 31:34.380* :  It takes a bit longer to set up a Pasky compared to the trusty old password method
*31:34.740- 31:35.580* :  we've always done.
*31:35.980- 31:37.000* :  So why the big shift?
*31:37.720- 31:39.200* :  Well, it's because, although convenient,
*31:39.200- 31:41.480* :  passwords are not trusty at all.
*31:41.740- 31:43.680* :  They're a terrible way to secure accounts.
*31:43.680- 31:47.460* :  Cory Macy hacks into companies with permission for a living.
*31:47.820- 31:51.620* :  I would say that if a company is restricting things only by password,
*31:51.620- 31:54.480* :  they're 100% horrible. We will always get in.
*31:54.820- 31:57.260* :  People are really bad when they create passwords.
*31:57.940- 32:01.080* :  Nine out of 10 times when I go into an environment and I try the password,
*32:01.080- 32:05.780* :  summer 2023 or winter 2023, you're going to get a few accounts.
*32:06.360- 32:09.280* :  Over the years, it has become possible to make passwords safer
*32:09.900- 32:11.300* :  if you're willing to put in the work.
*32:11.700- 32:14.780* :  First of all, of course, you've got to have really complex passwords
*32:14.780- 32:18.220* :  across every different online service, impossible to run.
*32:18.220- 32:19.800* :  So then you need a password manager,
*32:20.300- 32:22.460* :  then you need to have multi-factual authentication as well.
*32:22.980- 32:25.460* :  So if you try and log into a service that you don't normally have on,
*32:25.460- 32:27.520* :  let's say this device, it's a hassle.
*32:27.940- 32:31.160* :  It's no surprise, really, that security experts have largely failed
*32:31.160- 32:33.860* :  to persuade people to jump through all the hoops.
*32:34.040- 32:36.420* :  It'll take years for passwords to be phased out.
*32:36.560- 32:39.500* :  Right, now I need to put that password into this account.
*32:39.500- 32:43.060* :  And no doubt criminals will come up with new ways to get around pass keys.
*32:43.060- 32:48.500* :  But overall, the cyber security world is hoping that 2024 will be the year
*32:48.500- 32:50.960* :  that the happy death of the password begins.
*32:51.740- 32:52.720* :  Joe Tidy reporting.
*32:55.180- 32:58.880* :  And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:58.880- 33:02.860* :  Before we go, though, here's Jackie with News of this week's Happy Pot.

*33:13.720- 33:17.400* :  to save lowland gorillas by enabling eco-tourism,
*33:17.900- 33:21.660* :  working Barcelona to decode what a baby wants from its cry,
*33:22.400- 33:25.640* :  plans, culture and consensus among sperm whales,
*33:26.140- 33:31.420* :  and the 93-year-old golfer proving that age is just a number if you've got the right swing.
*33:32.160- 33:35.960* :  All in the happy pod available from Saturday, the 13th of January.
