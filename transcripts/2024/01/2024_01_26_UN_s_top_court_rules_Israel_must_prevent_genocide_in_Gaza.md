*01:49.620- 01:57.400* :  Service. Hi, Nick Karachi and at 14 GMT on Friday the 26th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:57.940- 02:03.060* :  The UN's top court warns Israel it must take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza after a test
*02:03.060- 02:09.620* :  case brought by South Africa. America's first execution using suffocation by nitrogen gas,
*02:09.620- 02:13.260* :  we speak to a journalist who watched the convicted murderer die.
*02:13.480- 02:17.760* :  The people who were in the room tonight believe that it was a more violent execution than any
*02:17.760- 02:23.980* :  of the lethal injections we witnessed before. Also in this podcast, plastic pollution
*02:23.980- 02:29.360* :  scientists discover that hermit crabs are increasingly seeking shelter in our discarded waste
*02:29.900- 02:35.260* :  and ahead of the release of a new film about Bob Marley, we talk to the actor about what it's
*02:35.260- 02:51.820* :  like to play the reggae legend. The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take a string of
*02:51.820- 02:57.120* :  emergency measures in Gaza but stops short of demanding a ceasefire. Under the measures Israel
*02:57.120- 03:02.820* :  has been told to do all in its power to prevent genocide there and immediately enable more urgently
*03:02.820- 03:08.980* :  needed aid to enter the territory. The hearing at the International Court of Justice in the Hague
*03:09.320- 03:13.920* :  is part of a case brought by South Africa, accusing Israel of committing genocide against
*03:13.920- 03:19.720* :  Palestinians. Israel vehemently denies the accusation. The court's rulings are legally binding
*03:19.720- 03:24.780* :  but there is no facility to enforce them. The president of the International Court of Justice
*03:24.780- 03:30.700* :  Judge Joan Donahue read the ruling. The state of Israel shall, in accordance with its
*03:30.720- 03:34.980* :  obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
*03:34.980- 03:41.120* :  in relation to the Palestinian's and Gaza, take all measures within its power to prevent
*03:41.120- 03:46.380* :  the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II of the Convention. In particular
*03:46.960- 03:53.220* :  A, killing members of the group, B, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members
*03:53.220- 03:59.000* :  of the group, C, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated
*03:59.000- 04:05.680* :  to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part and D, imposing measures intended
*04:05.680- 04:12.060* :  to prevent births within the group. Our correspondent Anna Holligan is in the Hague and spoke to us
*04:12.060- 04:16.180* :  just after the ruling was delivered. I'm just going to step away from the steps of the court.
*04:16.200- 04:21.540* :  You might also be able to detect in the background the sound of some of the Palestinian supporters
*04:21.540- 04:29.040* :  who have gathered outside the court gates. The provisional measures indicated by the judges
*04:29.280- 04:37.040* :  here at the ICJ focus on the remits of the genocide convention. So, Israel must take all measures
*04:37.040- 04:41.540* :  to prevent any acts that could be considered genocidal, any killing of members of the group,
*04:42.140- 04:46.080* :  bodily harm, inflicting conditions designed to bring about their destruction,
*04:47.020- 04:52.560* :  ensure military doesn't commit any genocidal acts, prevent and punish any public comments that
*04:52.560- 04:58.100* :  could be considered incitement to commit genociding Gaza. Israel must also take measures to ensure
*04:58.100- 05:04.540* :  humanitarian access, prevent the destruction of any evidence that could be used as part of the
*05:04.660- 05:12.060* :  fundamental genocide case and submit a report to the court within one month. The interesting thing
*05:12.060- 05:16.900* :  about this to note is that it's being interpreted widely as a victory for South Africa.
*05:17.480- 05:24.540* :  And yet all the ICJ is doing is reminding Israel and ordering Israel to stick to its obligations
*05:24.540- 05:29.820* :  under the genocide convention, something that Israel maintains it has done throughout this
*05:30.260- 05:35.920* :  entire military campaign. I do have a reaction here from Human Rights Watch. They say the world
*05:35.920- 05:41.080* :  courts landmark decision puts Israel and it's allies on notice that immediate actions needed to
*05:41.080- 05:46.800* :  prevent genocide and further atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza, lives hang in the balance,
*05:46.840- 05:52.640* :  they say. Another one here, a statement from ActionAIDS. They welcome the courts ruling a
*05:52.640- 05:58.700* :  affirming jurisdiction indicating the provisional measures, including the provision of urgently needed
*05:58.700- 06:04.440* :  basic services and humanitarian assistance. In terms of Israel's reaction, we've already heard
*06:04.440- 06:12.460* :  an indication that if the court were to order Israel to cease its military operations in Gaza,
*06:12.460- 06:17.100* :  that order would be ignored. This court doesn't have any enforcement powers, no police, no
*06:17.580- 06:22.940* :  police keeping force and therefore it would be down to states to ensure that order was followed,
*06:22.940- 06:29.340* :  but the court hasn't gone that far. The court has purely stuck to what's required under the
*06:29.340- 06:35.540* :  genocide convention. Israel has consistently said it is operating within international law.
*06:36.220- 06:41.060* :  Well, since we recorded that interview, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said
*06:41.060- 06:47.880* :  the charge of genocide against Israel is not only false but outrageous and the country will continue
*06:47.880- 06:53.240* :  to defend its people. The South Africa has welcomed the measures and hailed what it called a decisive
*06:53.240- 06:59.140* :  victory for the international rule of law and a milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian
*06:59.140- 07:05.220* :  people. We'll bring you further reaction to this ruling in our next edition of the Global News
*07:05.220- 07:14.440* :  Podcast. Next to Alabama in the United States. It's 753 central time tonight. The state of Alabama
*07:14.440- 07:21.100* :  started carrying out the execution of Kennedy Jean Smith by nitrogen epoxy. Smith was executed
*07:21.100- 07:28.700* :  for the 1988 capital murder of Elizabeth Doherling senate in Culver County. The commissioner of
*07:28.700- 07:34.020* :  Alabama's Department of Corrections, John Hamm, giving details of the execution of a convicted
*07:34.020- 07:40.340* :  murderer who's become the first known person to be executed by its suffocation with nitrogen gas.
*07:40.340- 07:46.160* :  Kenneth Smith was put to death after the Supreme Court again denied a last minute appeal. The state
*07:46.160- 07:53.040* :  has called its new protocol the most painless and humane method of execution known to man. United
*07:53.040- 07:58.100* :  Nations, human rights experts and lawyers for Kenneth Smith had sought to prevent it. Saying the
*07:58.100- 08:04.400* :  method was risky, experimental and could lead to a torturous death or non-fatal injury. Smith
*08:04.400- 08:11.520* :  was convicted of the murder of Elizabeth senate in 1988. Her son Mike senate spoke after the
*08:11.520- 08:17.680* :  execution. Nothing happened here today is going to bring bomb back. It's kind of a bitter sweet
*08:17.680- 08:23.740* :  day. We're not going to be jumping around, hooping and hollering, hooray and all that. You know,
*08:23.740- 08:30.420* :  the Bible says that evil deeds has consequences. Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions
*08:30.520- 08:37.580* :  35 years ago. Elizabeth Doherling don't want to send it down her justice tonight.
*08:38.420- 08:43.920* :  Lee Hedgepeth is a journalist from Alabama. He was one of the few media witnesses in the execution
*08:43.920- 08:50.680* :  room when Kenneth Smith was killed. He describes what he saw. The execution starts at about 753.
*08:51.700- 08:56.720* :  The nitrogen begins flowing into the gas mask and Kenny within a couple of minutes begins to
*08:56.720- 09:01.680* :  violently shake against the straps that are holding him to the gurney. That violent shaking lasts
*09:01.680- 09:07.860* :  for about four or five minutes. I've witnessed five executions in Alabama, four of them being lethal
*09:07.860- 09:12.980* :  injection and then this nitrogen execution and this is the most violent execution I've ever seen.
*09:13.220- 09:20.780* :  Sitting beside me was Deanna Smith, who is the wife of Kenny Smith and once Kenny began to
*09:20.780- 09:26.080* :  violently shake against those straps, she began to sob. There were also other media witnesses in
*09:26.080- 09:31.480* :  the room, folks who have seen execution after execution and I think there was a shock in the room
*09:31.480- 09:37.900* :  at how violent the execution was. Doctors are not in the room during the execution. A doctor did
*09:37.900- 09:43.940* :  printouts Kenny dead after the execution concluded but no doctor is visibly present in the execution
*09:43.940- 09:49.920* :  chamber. Alabama Department of Corrections has not showed any signal that they are worried about
*09:49.920- 09:56.360* :  what happened tonight. I think they view any death of an inmate as a success in terms of accomplishing
*09:56.360- 10:02.200* :  their goal of executing someone. So in the past we've had examples where executions were botched
*10:02.260- 10:06.860* :  and the commissioner of prisons has always said that they have gone as planned. There certainly
*10:07.300- 10:13.700* :  is support for the death penalty in Alabama compared to other states but nationwide. As I'm
*10:13.700- 10:18.420* :  sure more and more states have abolished the death penalty and more and more governors have
*10:18.720- 10:23.580* :  issued more Toriums here in Alabama. We had three botched executions in a row and our governor
*10:24.620- 10:30.600* :  issued a moratorium on the executions and that's what resulted in this first
*10:30.600- 10:35.780* :  nitrogen hypoxia execution. One of the issues that states have had is getting access to the drugs
*10:35.780- 10:40.360* :  necessary for lethal injection. A lot of the pharmaceutical companies are opposed to the use of
*10:40.360- 10:46.500* :  their drugs when it comes to executions. If Alabama, the state of Alabama considers this a success
*10:46.500- 10:52.220* :  in terms of ending Kenny's life, we likely see other states who are having those same difficulties
*10:52.220- 10:58.560* :  as Alabama accessing drugs move to methods like nitrogen hypoxia. They're more easy for the state
*10:58.560- 11:04.100* :  to accomplish. We've never seen an execution by nitrogen before so I think as people begin to
*11:04.100- 11:10.280* :  assess is this a more or less humane method of execution? Folks are going to have to realize that
*11:10.640- 11:14.900* :  the people who were in the room tonight believe that it was a more violent execution than any of
*11:14.900- 11:18.760* :  the lethal injections we witnessed before. So I think that's a reckoning folks are going to have to have.
*11:19.800- 11:26.160* :  Lea Hedgepeth. Japan has a problem with a falling population and it's taken various steps to
*11:26.160- 11:30.960* :  try to tackle the problem of labor shortages. They've included investing in robots and artificial
*11:30.960- 11:36.480* :  intelligence and hiring pensioners but foreign workers are also playing an increasingly
*11:36.480- 11:42.480* :  important role. A new report shows the number in the country has now passed two million for the
*11:42.480- 11:48.500* :  first time. A correspondent in Tokyo, Shima Khalil has been telling me more. The number of foreign
*11:48.500- 11:55.640* :  workers has actually continued to increase growing since 2013 so that's an 11 year continued growth
*11:55.640- 12:02.480* :  but what we're seeing is this big percentage jump 12.4% and I think the overall rate of growth
*12:02.480- 12:08.920* :  according to the labor ministry officials shows a recovery from the pandemic. And where are people
*12:08.920- 12:15.460* :  moving from predominantly? The top countries that we're seeing from the report are Vietnamese workers
*12:15.460- 12:20.060* :  and that's followed by Chinese and then Philippine nationals. How bad are these shortages?
*12:20.840- 12:25.700* :  I mean they are bad because you see the shortages in many sectors and I'll give you a very basic
*12:25.700- 12:30.740* :  example and this actually hasn't been mentioned in the report but day-to-day life here in Tokyo.
*12:30.740- 12:37.060* :  Everyone in the side guides to view what he's talking about, a shortage of taxi drivers and the
*12:37.060- 12:42.220* :  reason is that it takes a special license, it takes a lot of training, you need to know where
*12:42.220- 12:46.880* :  you're going and you need to navigate Tokyo and every other driver for example that I
*12:47.600- 12:53.060* :  that I go to work with is an elderly driver because there aren't that many experienced drivers
*12:53.060- 12:59.980* :  but the report says that the two sectors that have seen the most growth are manufacturing and
*12:59.980- 13:05.600* :  construction and if you think about it it makes sense because these are sectors that need young
*13:05.600- 13:12.940* :  people who are embarking on their career but are also able to take on physical work. Another
*13:12.940- 13:18.160* :  sector is health care especially with an aging population care for the elderly then becomes
*13:18.160- 13:23.280* :  really crucial and there are many things that make it difficult and I can tell you this you know
*13:23.280- 13:29.420* :  personally the language barrier is a huge thing if you're a young family it is very difficult when
*13:29.420- 13:34.460* :  you're starting out child care is quite expensive but also the social hindrance many if you come
*13:34.460- 13:41.220* :  here and and and you live and you work Japan is a very homogenous society and you do feel like an
*13:41.220- 13:47.760* :  outsider there and there hasn't been any any concrete steps either by those in power or by the
*13:47.760- 13:56.600* :  society itself to change that to be more accepting of others. How is Japan enticing people from overseas?
*13:56.600- 14:02.080* :  Is it having to give large incentives? I don't think that it is at the moment there is still a
*14:02.080- 14:08.360* :  struggle and there is still a disagreement if you will about whether or not this is something that
*14:08.360- 14:13.360* :  Japan wants to open up to open the job market and most people that come in come in because they
*14:13.360- 14:20.260* :  want to live in Japan. There are reports and talks that the government is trying to revamp its
*14:20.260- 14:26.260* :  trainee scheme because that has actually taken the biggest tumble during the pandemic but otherwise
*14:26.260- 14:31.020* :  I think it's more about people wanting to come to Japan but it's one thing that keeps coming up
*14:31.020- 14:37.320* :  time and time again is that if Japan wants to get over the falling birth rate the fact that it
*14:37.320- 14:43.420* :  is an aging population it will have to open its doors to young people to foreign workers to come
*14:43.420- 14:49.660* :  in and to want to live here and for that the change doesn't only need to be happening in the work
*14:49.660- 14:54.520* :  sector or in the labor sector if you will it needs to be happening on a social level as well.
*14:55.040- 15:01.960* :  Shima Khalil in Tokyo. Scientists in Poland say hermit crabs which normally use discarded snail
*15:01.960- 15:08.360* :  shells as their armour are increasingly using plastic waste instead. The researchers at the University
*15:08.360- 15:14.700* :  of Warsaw studied photographs of the crustaceans in image libraries, photo-sharing sites and social
*15:14.700- 15:20.200* :  media. One of the scientists involved Marta Skolkin spoke to James Coppnell about the study.
*15:20.760- 15:26.240* :  I heard crabs are normally using natural snail shells to protect their abdomen but in a recent
*15:26.240- 15:32.600* :  study we have found that essentially they are increasingly often using plastic elements or
*15:32.600- 15:40.240* :  elements of glass and metal to protect their abdomen. So we demonstrated that using eye ecology
*15:40.240- 15:45.840* :  so the internet ecology by looking at pictures that people were posting online through various
*15:45.840- 15:51.120* :  locations in the world. And does it work? Does it provide the sort of protection they need?
*15:52.140- 15:58.160* :  So it looks like this phenomena of using plastic shells instead of natural ones is quite a
*15:58.180- 16:04.600* :  pervasive phenomena. It's been demonstrated in 10 out of 16 of all world species on all of the
*16:04.600- 16:11.920* :  earth's tropical coast and we are discussing in the article the various mechanisms this shift might
*16:11.920- 16:19.040* :  how it might impact their biology. So for example we know that plastic shells are likely to be
*16:19.040- 16:24.220* :  much lighter so it might actually give them more energy to use that these resources for other
*16:24.220- 16:29.340* :  things such as increased reproduction but that's a hypothesis and we need to test it in the field.
*16:29.720- 16:34.580* :  Ah so presumably if you see loads more hermit crabs well this is not very scientific but you'll
*16:34.580- 16:39.100* :  get a sense that they are reproducing more. We could really get that could be a big increase
*16:39.100- 16:44.720* :  in hermit crabs simply because they're using plastic waste. Well I think what the study shows really
*16:44.740- 16:50.440* :  is a fundamental shift in demonstrating that more and more animals use plastic in their life
*16:50.440- 16:56.080* :  cycle and their biology. We know that birds for example use plastic in their nests and it might
*16:56.080- 17:03.060* :  interfere with the way they choose mates and with the way their reproductive output is changed.
*17:03.720- 17:07.460* :  And similar thing might be happening from hermit crabs and it's a suggestion that
*17:08.160- 17:13.300* :  animals the world over might be increasingly using artificial resources such as we do humans.
*17:14.760- 17:20.740* :  In their life cycle and we need experiments in the field in the lab to really demonstrate whether
*17:20.740- 17:25.900* :  it's a good or bad thing for them. Marta Schulkin from the University of Warsaw.
*17:28.420- 17:34.500* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast a century after it disappeared a Gustav Klimt painting is
*17:34.540- 17:44.400* :  found in Vienna. This is the story of a powerful Nigerian televangelist.
*17:44.480- 17:49.660* :  He was a huge celebrity and had a way of presenting himself as man of God.
*17:49.860- 17:52.420* :  He attracted followers to his church from around the globe.
*17:52.660- 17:54.700* :  It was like going to heaven and being asked to stay.
*17:54.860- 18:01.000* :  But once there some say that TV Joshua used his power to control, manipulate and abuse.
*18:01.860- 18:06.800* :  This is World of Secrets from the BBC World Service. Season 2, the Disciple.
*18:07.300- 18:12.000* :  We all thought we were in heaven but we were in hell and in hell terrible things happen.
*18:13.000- 18:16.240* :  Such for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:19.360- 18:22.640* :  The security situation caused by gang violence in Haiti.
*18:23.140- 18:26.900* :  One of the world's poorest nations prompted the country's Prime Minister Ariel Henry
*18:27.420- 18:31.300* :  to request international support from the United Nations last year.
*18:31.860- 18:36.080* :  Kenya offered to send police officers and its parliament approved the mission in November.
*18:36.080- 18:39.800* :  But now a court has ruled the plan is unconstitutional and has blocked it,
*18:39.920- 18:43.400* :  not correspondent in Nairobi. Barbara Pled Asha is following developments.
*18:43.920- 18:47.960* :  The plan was for Kenya to lead a multinational force to Haiti which would support
*18:47.960- 18:50.800* :  the local security forces there to push back the armed gangs.
*18:51.460- 18:54.900* :  And Kenya was planning to contribute 1000 police officers to it.
*18:54.900- 18:58.360* :  But other countries had also pledged troops, Burundi, Chad, Senegal for example.
*18:59.440- 19:02.460* :  So Kenya was going to be taking a leading role in this global issue.
*19:02.460- 19:05.320* :  And it's something that the United States in particular have been pushing for,
*19:05.320- 19:08.300* :  although the Americans were willing to lead the force themselves.
*19:08.300- 19:11.180* :  They were trying to find somebody to lead it and Kenya stepped forward.
*19:11.700- 19:14.640* :  And then it was authorized by the UN in October.
*19:14.640- 19:18.720* :  It is not a full-fledged UN peacekeeping force, but there was a resolution to authorize it.
*19:19.180- 19:22.580* :  Although the details of the deployment, you know, the rules of engagement,
*19:22.580- 19:25.760* :  how much in combat it would engage in and the excess strategy,
*19:25.760- 19:26.960* :  those are still being worked out.
*19:27.460- 19:29.880* :  So what were the problems or the perceived problems?
*19:30.760- 19:33.660* :  Well, what we're seeing now is this internal political challenge
*19:34.440- 19:35.700* :  to this decision.
*19:35.700- 19:41.380* :  The main question raised by the opposition was why was it justified to send security forces
*19:41.380- 19:44.340* :  thousands of miles away when Kenya had its own security problems?
*19:44.820- 19:46.500* :  And then also the question of who would fund it.
*19:46.680- 19:50.120* :  Now, the government here insisted that it would be funded by UN member states,
*19:50.160- 19:52.700* :  but it's not clear if the money is completely there yet.
*19:53.260- 19:57.220* :  So this court challenge was brought by a leader of the opposition last year,
*19:57.220- 19:59.580* :  at which point the high court blocked the deployment,
*19:59.720- 20:01.640* :  and now came through finally with its ruling.
*20:02.320- 20:06.820* :  And the ruling is that the president does not have the constitutional authority to deploy
*20:06.820- 20:10.720* :  police abroad, only the armed forces, and that if it deploys officers,
*20:10.720- 20:14.480* :  there needs to be a reciprocal arrangement in place with the host government.
*20:14.480- 20:17.520* :  So, I mean, the bottom line is that the court is saying it's not constitutional.
*20:17.900- 20:19.040* :  So what do you think happens now?
*20:19.280- 20:21.040* :  I think there could very well be an appeal.
*20:21.180- 20:22.420* :  I mean, it's not clear what will happen,
*20:22.480- 20:25.540* :  but this decision would most likely be appealed, I should think.
*20:26.460- 20:29.160* :  It does seem as if preparation for the mission had already begun.
*20:29.160- 20:35.520* :  The BBC has been told that police have had two months of training in various ways to go to Haiti.
*20:36.540- 20:38.080* :  There's also still the question of funding, though.
*20:38.080- 20:41.320* :  The Biden administration has said it's committed to finding the resources,
*20:41.320- 20:45.140* :  but we can see that it's having difficulty getting funding approval from Congress
*20:45.140- 20:46.360* :  and other matters, like Ukraine.
*20:46.360- 20:48.760* :  So I think the funding is still an open question as well.
*20:49.520- 20:50.300* :  Barbara Pletasha.
*20:51.120- 20:54.720* :  Augustaugh Klimt painting, which was considered lost or destroyed,
*20:54.720- 20:58.340* :  for nearly a century has resurfaced in the Austrian capital Vienna.
*20:58.980- 21:04.620* :  Portrait of Freyline Lisa has been privately owned by the family of the woman in the painting
*21:04.620- 21:09.120* :  since the 1960s, but it's not clear where it was kept before then.
*21:09.120- 21:13.740* :  Klimt's works are highly sought after in the international art market and usually fetch
*21:13.740- 21:15.460* :  tens of millions of dollars.
*21:15.840- 21:19.580* :  Our correspondent in Vienna, Bethany Bell, told us more about the portrait.
*21:20.160- 21:26.320* :  It's the painting of a dark head woman wearing a blue floral cape
*21:27.260- 21:34.760* :  against a red orange background, very typical art experts say for Klimt's later work.
*21:34.900- 21:38.920* :  And it's called Portrait of Freyline Lisa.
*21:39.520- 21:44.100* :  Now the Lisa's were a big, wealthy, Jewish industrial family who lived in Vienna.
*21:44.740- 21:48.260* :  Is there any evidence it was stolen by the Nazis ahead of the Second World War?
*21:48.940- 21:54.040* :  Ernst Ploil, who's the co-managing director of the Kinsky Auction House,
*21:54.420- 22:00.360* :  says that so far they found no evidence to suggest it was stolen or looted either before
*22:00.360- 22:02.760* :  or during the Second World War.
*22:03.140- 22:08.960* :  He says they have reached out to the heirs of the Lisa family as potential restitution payments.
*22:09.860- 22:14.300* :  Is it possible that the family had this painting and simply had no idea how much it was worth?
*22:15.440- 22:19.680* :  If they knew it was a Gustav Klimt, they surely must have known how much it was worth,
*22:20.220- 22:23.060* :  but we don't know very much about the circumstances.
*22:23.700- 22:26.080* :  And how much is the painting expected to fetch it auction?
*22:26.820- 22:33.700* :  The Auction House estimates it could be something between 30 to 50 million euros.
*22:33.700- 22:38.160* :  Michele Kovacheck is the managing director of the Kinsky Auction House.
*22:42.240- 22:46.520* :  If you make comparisons with other paintings by Gustav Klimt that have been auctioned in the
*22:46.520- 22:51.280* :  last 10 to 20 years with results of between 40 and 50 million euros,
*22:51.960- 22:54.520* :  that even 60 or 70 million is conceivable.
*22:55.160- 22:58.940* :  And the Lisa family have a very interesting backstory, don't they?
*22:59.680- 23:02.980* :  Yes, Lily Lisa was a patron of the arts.
*23:03.560- 23:08.060* :  She was killed in the Holocaust. Her daughters escaped to Britain.
*23:08.160- 23:13.520* :  I understand and we know that certainly one of them decided that one of their daughters
*23:13.520- 23:15.220* :  should be painted by Gustav Klimt.
*23:15.380- 23:17.040* :  But this is an unfinished painting.
*23:17.240- 23:22.660* :  It was in his Atelier and then was given back to the family after he died in an unfinished
*23:22.660- 23:24.900* :  condition, but it looks extremely beautiful.
*23:26.020- 23:28.400* :  Bethany Bell speaking to Nigel Adely.
*23:29.560- 23:33.680* :  The actor Kingsley Benadier has just appeared in the Barbie film as one of the kens,
*23:33.680- 23:38.300* :  but he's perhaps better known for playing iconic black leaders in the last four years.
*23:38.300- 23:43.740* :  He's portrayed former US President Barack Obama in the Komi rule and civil rights activist Malcolm
*23:43.740- 23:49.920* :  X in one night in Miami. Well now he's playing the Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley in one love.
*23:50.180- 23:54.660* :  The film about a crucial period in the musician's life are made with the support of the Marley
*23:54.660- 23:57.760* :  family. Mark Savage has been speaking to Kingsley Benadier.
*23:59.580- 24:01.400* :  You can't mimic him, you can't copy him.
*24:01.880- 24:05.520* :  Reggae's the people music. That was really the challenge for people coming together.
*24:07.680- 24:12.440* :  In his short film career so far, Kingsley Benadier has already portrayed Barack Obama
*24:12.440- 24:18.360* :  and Malcolm X, but stepping into the shoes of Bob Marley was an entirely different challenge,
*24:19.020- 24:22.540* :  not least because he had to master the stars Jamaican dialect.
*24:23.360- 24:28.520* :  There's a war going on. Oh, I can't bring peace. I can't even get peace from his set.
*24:28.600- 24:32.640* :  I don't think I've ever seen a film that's on patroir before.
*24:33.020- 24:36.760* :  I don't want the audience to feel like they understand everything I'm saying, because that's not
*24:36.760- 24:40.720* :  truthful. If you listen to Bob for two hours, you won't understand, unless you're Jamaican,
*24:40.720- 24:45.960* :  you won't understand everything he's saying, but we need you to understand the emotion in the story.
*24:46.020- 24:53.000* :  One love, one at one destiny. Unusually for a biopic, that story covers just two years of Bob's life.
*24:53.100- 24:53.900* :  It's 1976.
*24:57.300- 25:01.100* :  The attempt to assassinate him on Bob's life kind of forced him into an exo in London,
*25:01.100- 25:03.960* :  where we created one of the greatest albums of all time.
*25:05.640- 25:06.320* :  I'm exodus.
*25:07.760- 25:10.560* :  You hear him talking about music and what it meant to him.
*25:13.040- 25:15.700* :  I think our music is the universal language, you know.
*25:15.920- 25:16.820* :  Exodus.
*25:17.560- 25:23.000* :  Only playing music with a certain message and a message is for our people.
*25:23.040- 25:26.740* :  This is a guy who loved what he did and who was obsessed with it.
*25:28.840- 25:32.600* :  In January last year, Kingsley was in London's Alexandra Palace,
*25:32.600- 25:39.720* :  recreating one of Bob Marley's most famous concerts in 1977 at the Rainbow Theatre in Finnsbury Park.
*25:42.240- 25:47.300* :  Watching from the stalls was Bob's son Ziggy, who would have been just eight years old at the time.
*25:47.820- 25:52.320* :  It was a time of change, as I could, you could feel the energy in the ear.
*25:52.360- 25:55.220* :  You see what you're going on around your father, your mother.
*25:55.520- 25:56.140* :  What'd be your sense?
*25:56.380- 25:59.500* :  Invaded Bob Marley's home and attempted to take the life of a singer.
*25:59.700- 26:00.460* :  Why, in it?
*26:01.420- 26:02.480* :  Don't worry about that.
*26:03.100- 26:04.560* :  Don't worry.
*26:11.600- 26:13.360* :  What advice did you have for Kingsley?
*26:13.700- 26:15.800* :  Kingsley does his homework, he's going to be a guy.
*26:16.360- 26:17.380* :  To prepare for the role,
*26:17.520- 26:18.900* :  a revolutionaries.
*26:19.140- 26:21.600* :  Kingsley studied hours of archive footage.
*26:21.940- 26:24.320* :  You're the smash of a revolutionary.
*26:24.320- 26:26.560* :  In the most unlikely of places.
*26:26.560- 26:30.780* :  Watch me dance, dance the night away.
*26:31.480- 26:35.460* :  You were preparing for this role while you were on set filming the Barbie movie.
*26:35.600- 26:35.800* :  Yeah.
*26:36.120- 26:39.720* :  I can't think of two more separate movies in terms of...
*26:39.720- 26:41.980* :  Some producer told me that we were starting in June.
*26:42.520- 26:43.740* :  And Bobby, we started in March.
*26:43.900- 26:46.980* :  So yeah, I was just doing like a groundwork, picking up a guitar,
*26:47.320- 26:49.800* :  and all of the interviews to listen through.
*26:49.800- 26:52.040* :  So I sat up a little station in Barbie London,
*26:52.780- 26:55.100* :  scrambling to transcribe all of these interviews,
*26:55.520- 26:57.680* :  and then just trying to learn basic chords.
*26:58.320- 26:59.520* :  A station in Barbie London.
*26:59.620- 27:02.360* :  It was, just behind the merger of Dojo Casa.
*27:03.440- 27:04.600* :  Or the merger of Dojo, whatever.
*27:08.160- 27:09.480* :  You can't choreograph him.
*27:10.440- 27:11.460* :  It's too spontaneous.
*27:11.920- 27:14.620* :  I always think it's like the music's flowing through him like electricity.
*27:15.100- 27:16.880* :  Yeah, he's singing for his life.
*27:17.180- 27:18.340* :  Every time he steps up.
*27:25.620- 27:28.540* :  It's all I ever have.
*27:29.140- 27:33.980* :  Actor Kingsley Benadier and the film One Love It Out on February 14th.
*27:36.640- 27:37.660* :  And that's all from us for now,
*27:37.660- 27:41.560* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*27:41.560- 27:44.380* :  First of all, here is Jackie with News of a Happy Pod.

*28:05.140- 28:07.520* :  in a Hollywood blockbuster soundtrack.
*28:08.180- 28:11.600* :  And in unrelated news, there's a surprising amount of swearing.
*28:12.280- 28:13.540* :  Don't worry, it's still a family show.
*28:13.960- 28:17.540* :  All in the Happy Pod available from Saturday the 27th of January.
