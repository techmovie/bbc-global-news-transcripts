*00:16.120- 00:16.860* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*00:32.540- 00:37.900* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*00:49.320- 00:53.180* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:56.020- 01:02.920* :  I'm Nigel Adely and at 1,400 GMT on Wednesday the 3rd of January, these are our main stories.
*01:03.780- 01:09.300* :  Iranian media's explosions have killed at least 70 people at an event commemorating a top
*01:09.300- 01:15.320* :  military commander, tensions rise in Lebanon following the assassination of a deputy leader
*01:15.320- 01:16.000* :  of Hamas.
*01:16.000- 01:22.240* :  Japan's government sends in 2,000 soldiers to help rescue survivors of Monday's earthquake.
*01:23.080- 01:28.840* :  And accusations of COVID corruption in Vietnam as a former health minister goes on trial.
*01:31.660- 01:32.660* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:33.160- 01:36.220* :  We have some teeth that are very worn in kind of a funny way.
*01:36.760- 01:43.060* :  That might indicate the use of teeth as tools, maybe for textile work, leather work, basketry.
*01:43.380- 01:48.120* :  The newly found medieval skeletons that are bringing up as many questions as answers
*01:48.520- 01:49.100* :  for scientists.
*01:53.640- 02:00.300* :  We begin in Iran where state media say at least 70 people have been killed in what the authorities
*02:00.300- 02:02.400* :  are calling a terrorist attack.
*02:02.980- 02:08.380* :  It happened in the city of Kerman during a ceremony marking four years since Iran's most
*02:08.380- 02:13.580* :  powerful military commander, Kasim Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike.
*02:13.660- 02:18.240* :  Paham Gabbadi from BBC Persian told us more about what's being reported.
*02:19.040- 02:25.080* :  The two explosions took place and they were less than a kilometer away from Kasim Soleimani's
*02:25.620- 02:27.840* :  where he's buried from his grave.
*02:28.360- 02:32.760* :  So the footage that I was checking right now, you see a lot of people who were wounded,
*02:32.760- 02:34.920* :  who were bleeding, ate services were coming.
*02:34.920- 02:38.320* :  But because it was crowded, they were saying they had difficulty reaching the people.
*02:38.760- 02:42.660* :  And they have asked everyone who took part in the ceremony to evacuate the place.
*02:43.040- 02:45.800* :  So they would be able to help the wounded.
*02:46.260- 02:48.380* :  Have we any idea who may be behind this attack?
*02:48.540- 02:53.540* :  They haven't mentioned who has made the attack yet, but they say it's of a terrorist nature.
*02:54.080- 02:58.440* :  Usually in the past like the one that took place almost a year ago in Shiraz and before
*02:58.440- 03:04.960* :  that the same thing happened in Afghans, usually ISIS took responsibility for such attacks.
*03:04.960- 03:08.560* :  But it's not clear at this moment who's responsible for this particular attack.
*03:09.020- 03:15.520* :  And just remind us, how significant was Kasim Soleimani within the Iranian military?
*03:16.240- 03:23.360* :  So he was the top Iranian general and the architect of Iran's foreign military strategy.
*03:23.360- 03:30.500* :  So he was behind all the strategies that Iranians made outside Iranian border, not inside
*03:30.500- 03:30.960* :  the border.
*03:31.360- 03:35.780* :  And he was extremely close to the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
*03:35.780- 03:40.380* :  So that's why they call him the architect of Iran's military strategy outside Iran,
*03:40.380- 03:41.480* :  outside Iranian borders.
*03:44.160- 03:49.800* :  The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon has said it is deeply concerned about
*03:49.800- 03:55.760* :  violence escalating after the killing of the senior Hamas figure Salel Al-Araadi and five others
*03:55.760- 04:02.560* :  in Beirut. It said a wider conflict would have devastating consequences for both Israel and
*04:02.560- 04:07.900* :  Lebanon. Israel hasn't claimed responsibility for the killing, but how says its military
*04:07.900- 04:14.020* :  is prepared for any scenario. Protests broke out on Tuesday night, not only in Lebanon,
*04:14.020- 04:20.060* :  but also the West Bank, where Mr. Al-Araadi is from. The Hamas leader, Ishmael Hania,
*04:20.540- 04:23.000* :  has warned that death will not go unpunished.
*04:25.620- 04:32.580* :  We affirm that the assassination by the Zionist occupation of the great brother and national
*04:32.580- 04:38.440* :  fighting leader Sheikh Salel Al-Araadi and his brothers of the movement's leadership and teams
*04:38.440- 04:45.900* :  on the Lebanese lands is a complete terrorist act, a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and an
*04:45.900- 04:52.800* :  expansion of Israel's hostility against our people and nation. The occupation is responsible
*04:53.300- 04:54.500* :  for its repercussions.
*04:55.700- 05:01.160* :  Corin Chalbe is in Beirut and told me what the mood was like on the streets of the Lebanese capital.
*05:01.920- 05:08.460* :  Well, at the moment I am in the middle of the street where the attack happened, we can see clearly
*05:08.460- 05:16.360* :  the apartment that was targeted. It is actually business as usual. The shops have reopened. This
*05:16.360- 05:22.960* :  morning, the main street was closed, but now it has been reopened. And it is a crowded city
*05:22.960- 05:29.760* :  people moving by as a normal. But on everyone's mind hangs one question,
*05:30.340- 05:36.600* :  how is this going to change the rules of engagement between Israel and Hasbullah,
*05:37.040- 05:44.780* :  is Hasbullah going to retaliate and how? And everyone is looking for any glimpse of answer for this
*05:45.540- 05:51.420* :  in the speech that Hassan Nasrallah is expected to give this evening at 6 o'clock local time.
*05:51.820- 05:57.680* :  And that is a very highly anticipated. Is there any indication of what you might say at this stage?
*05:58.220- 06:04.100* :  We know that Hasbullah issued a statement yesterday and they condemned the killing of Haruri. They
*06:04.100- 06:11.800* :  said it will not go without answer. But the question is whether Hasbullah is going to give more
*06:11.800- 06:18.440* :  details about the direction that Hasbullah would take in order to retaliate to what is seen here
*06:18.800- 06:26.200* :  as a violation of a very important thread line for Hasbullah and for Lebanon. There is a lot
*06:26.200- 06:31.400* :  of speculation, but everyone is waiting to hear about it from the men himself.
*06:32.180- 06:35.180* :  And how dangerous a moment is this for the wider Middle East?
*06:35.740- 06:42.060* :  It is quite dangerous. It is seen as a very big escalation. Whether this is going to be the
*06:42.060- 06:49.980* :  trigger for an all-out war, people in Lebanon, in general, they don't think so. They think that
*06:49.980- 06:56.540* :  this is a pretty serious development. This could lead to something completely new, something
*06:56.540- 07:03.100* :  different from what we've been seeing in the last months. There have been daily confrontations
*07:03.100- 07:10.140* :  between Hasbullah and Israel from southern Lebanon towards Northern Israel and from Northern
*07:10.140- 07:16.540* :  Israel towards southern Lebanon. But this has been seen as a contained struggle, even if it happened
*07:16.540- 07:23.040* :  on a daily basis. A lot of people were killed so far. But what happened yesterday is seen as
*07:23.040- 07:28.180* :  something completely different that could take things to a completely different level. But no one
*07:28.180- 07:31.300* :  is sure how is this going to be translated on the ground.
*07:31.800- 07:35.120* :  Corrin Chorbe on the streets of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
*07:36.120- 07:40.640* :  64 people are now known to have died in Japan following Monday's earthquake.
*07:41.400- 07:46.560* :  Tens of thousands of households remain without power, and the authorities have warned the risk of
*07:46.560- 07:53.180* :  landslides and heavy rain. The Prime Minister for Mio Kishida said rescue workers were in a race
*07:53.180- 08:02.100* :  against time to find survivors. We have received reports that there are still many people waiting
*08:02.100- 08:07.360* :  for rescue and the collapsed buildings. Today, in addition to increasing the number of
*08:07.360- 08:14.500* :  self-defense personnel from 1,000 to 2,000 people, we will also strengthen our system by more than
*08:14.500- 08:19.220* :  doubling the number of rescue dogs in the self-defense forces and police.
*08:20.080- 08:24.480* :  Our Asia reporter, Serranjana Tawari, is monitoring events from Tokyo.
*08:25.200- 08:32.720* :  One of the main challenges is the weather. There is heavy rain expected and potential landslides,
*08:33.160- 08:38.780* :  and that's really going to hamper the efforts of the rescue workers who are working on the
*08:39.060- 08:45.760* :  not open insula. Now, the other big challenge is aftershocks. Officials had warned that there
*08:45.760- 08:52.500* :  was likely to be many aftershocks after the New Year's day earthquake, and today authorities
*08:52.500- 08:59.640* :  actually registered a 5.5 magnitude aftershock in the same area as has been affected.
*09:00.020- 09:04.740* :  Roads are also damaged, and that's making it difficult for rescue workers to be able to reach
*09:04.740- 09:10.380* :  some of the collapsed buildings, and potentially the people who are trapped under those buildings as well.
*09:11.000- 09:16.240* :  And how much aid is managing to get through? The authorities have certainly stepped up the
*09:16.440- 09:22.500* :  rescue efforts. They have, the Prime Minister has announced that more army personnel will be
*09:22.500- 09:30.700* :  deployed, doubling the current figures to 2,000 sniffer dogs are also being sent in, and it is
*09:30.700- 09:37.500* :  going to the general area. The problem is there are many towns where buildings have been completely
*09:37.500- 09:44.840* :  flattened. In fact, one town, the town of Susu, the mayor has said that there are almost no
*09:44.840- 09:50.420* :  buildings that are still standing, but it's been impossible to access that town. And therefore,
*09:50.420- 09:56.040* :  the aid, the clean water, is not able to get to the people who need it most.
*09:56.320- 10:02.400* :  Now, we're getting to the point where it's beyond 48 hours since the first 7.6 magnitude
*10:02.460- 10:09.320* :  earthquake struck on Monday, and obviously the window for rescuing people is closing,
*10:09.400- 10:14.840* :  although the government has said that since yesterday, they have rescued 18 more people.
*10:15.520- 10:21.700* :  Surajana Tawari in Tokyo. The conflict in the Middle East is continuing to disrupt shipping
*10:21.700- 10:27.660* :  in the Red Sea, who to rebels based in Yemen have launched repeated attacks on what they believe
*10:27.660- 10:33.840* :  vessels bound for Israel. Now, the head of the international chamber of shipping has told the BBC
*10:33.840- 10:39.980* :  that one in five merchant vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea route and taking the much longer route
*10:39.980- 10:46.440* :  around southern Africa, with obvious implications for global food trading. Our business reporter Jonathan
*10:46.440- 10:53.740* :  Joseph's told me more. This is a really important route for global trade. About 12% of global trade
*10:53.740- 10:59.780* :  goes through the Suez Canal route. What we know now about this attack last night is that it was
*11:00.080- 11:05.520* :  a vessel belonging to the French shipping line CMA-CGM, which was targeted the stage.
*11:06.560- 11:11.740* :  And that's according to a statement from the Houthi rebels based in Yemen who have been targeting
*11:11.740- 11:16.820* :  ships like this for the last few weeks. They said that that ship was heading to, as they put
*11:16.820- 11:22.220* :  occupied Palestine, and that was why they targeted it, and they vowed to continue these attacks.
*11:22.220- 11:27.740* :  They've now been 24 of them since the middle of November, according to the US military.
*11:28.360- 11:34.460* :  And what this attack has done again is to highlight the risk that seafarers are facing if they try
*11:34.460- 11:40.860* :  to navigate this passage. And that's why the Secretary General of the international chamber of
*11:40.860- 11:46.240* :  shipping has been talking about this. He says that the safety of crews is the number one priority
*11:46.240- 11:51.420* :  for these shipping lines, and that's why they're now having to go around the Cape of Good Hope
*11:51.420- 11:56.480* :  all the way around Africa. It's a much longer route, and that's why so many of them are doing that.
*11:56.860- 12:00.820* :  I was speaking to one shipping analyst who was saying it's predominantly western-owned ships,
*12:00.820- 12:07.060* :  the big European shipping lines, Merce and Hapagloid, we know, for instance, and MSC are all
*12:07.260- 12:14.120* :  avoiding the Red Sea for now. And they feel that they are too much of a target, whereas there are
*12:14.160- 12:21.240* :  other ships that are still using that area. It is still busy with maritime traffic, but it's
*12:21.240- 12:26.280* :  ships that, for instance, are Russian-owned ships perhaps carrying sanctioned oil from Russia to
*12:26.280- 12:33.400* :  India, which perhaps feel less vulnerable. And what are the implications of all of this for global trade?
*12:34.200- 12:38.260* :  Well, one thing that is clear is that it's definitely adding more cost into the system.
*12:38.820- 12:43.140* :  Quite how much of an impact it ends up having on consumers is going to depend on
*12:43.140- 12:49.560* :  just how long this all goes on for. We know that a journey around the Cape of Good Hope instead of
*12:49.560- 12:54.580* :  via the Swence Canal could add a million dollars to fuel costs, but there's also added security
*12:54.580- 13:01.160* :  and higher staffing costs. So we know that some companies, for instance, in the UK are feeling
*13:01.160- 13:06.000* :  they impact in terms of having to pay more to bring their goods from Asia to Europe.
*13:06.380- 13:11.540* :  Ultimately, some of that will get passed on to the consumers, and at a time when the global economy
*13:11.540- 13:15.960* :  is still battling inflation, that's the last thing many people want to see, but we just don't know
*13:15.960- 13:22.520* :  how long and how deep that knock on impact will be. Jonathan Joseph's, and for more on that,
*13:22.520- 13:28.440* :  our friends on another BBC podcast called The Global Story have done a deep dive in their
*13:28.440- 13:33.880* :  episode who are the Houthi rebels and why they're attacking Red Sea ships, which looks at who
*13:33.880- 13:40.760* :  backs them and what it means for the wider region. The number of Ukrainian civilians killed by the
*13:40.760- 13:46.960* :  conflict with Russia has now risen to more than 10,000, according to figures recorded by the UN.
*13:47.660- 13:53.480* :  President Vladimir Putin has pledged to intensify attacks, and 45 people were killed last week
*13:53.480- 14:00.920* :  according to Keeve, and some 160 wounded after a raft of drone and missile strikes. Our senior
*14:01.540- 14:06.800* :  international correspondent Oleg Urintel's The Story of two talented young women, both civilians
*14:06.800- 14:09.860* :  who were killed in the city of Zafaricia last summer.
*14:13.500- 14:18.740* :  The voice of a promising young Ukrainian singer, Kristina Spitsena.
*14:20.180- 14:25.320* :  Our last song will be for the people and defenders of her song, she says.
*14:31.540- 14:38.820* :  Her friend, Spitsena Spitsena, is alongside her on guitar as they perform outside a supermarket.
*14:43.760- 14:48.540* :  It became their Requiem. 20 minutes later, both were dead.
*14:48.540- 14:57.360* :  I've come to the place where the two young women were killed. I'm at the exact spot.
*14:58.540- 15:04.280* :  You can see the windows have been blown out. The young women had come to take a break. They'd finished
*15:05.380- 15:14.000* :  singing, and a rocket came slamming into the ground. I'm with Halina. She's the mother of Kristina
*15:14.000- 15:21.940* :  who was killed here. Halina, I know you've had an unbelievable loss. Can you tell me how has the loss
*15:21.940- 15:31.780* :  of Kristina affected you and the family? You don't know. You don't know what plans to make
*15:31.780- 15:39.360* :  for tomorrow. Sometimes you are able to smile. But then you remember that she can't smile anymore.
*15:44.220- 15:49.680* :  I can't explain it. It's as if you have died, but can still speak.
*15:55.000- 16:02.720* :  Hi, Yuri. I'm with Yuri, Samaikan, his wife, Anna, and their daughter, Sasha, who's 12.
*16:02.900- 16:09.780* :  We're sitting in the garden under the shade of a tree. Yuri and Anna are Svetlana's parents.
*16:09.860- 16:21.340* :  I was at home, heard an explosion and got in the car. I knew they were out there somewhere in
*16:21.340- 16:27.500* :  the area. I told the police I was looking for my daughter and her friend.
*16:28.500- 16:39.440* :  Police brought me to the place and I saw what I saw. Svetlana was lying on the ground in front
*16:39.440- 16:52.140* :  of me. How is it possible in the 21st century to do something like this? Completely unprovoked.
*16:58.220- 17:05.340* :  I'm at Kristina's grave site now with Halina and she's buried side by side with Svetlana.
*17:05.580- 17:13.960* :  The two graves are together. There are Ukrainian flags flying and lots of floral tributes,
*17:13.960- 17:19.280* :  flowers all around the graves. Halina, how does it feel for you to come here?
*17:21.300- 17:30.260* :  You come here to see or hear something. The wind blows and you think it's the soul of your child,
*17:30.980- 17:31.460* :  Halina.
*17:55.600- 18:00.800* :  All a girl in reporting. When COVID-19 was spreading across the globe,
*18:01.420- 18:07.040* :  Vietnam was one of the countries initially praised for taking effective measures against the disease.
*18:07.940- 18:13.160* :  But the officials in charge at that time have since become embroiled in a series of legal cases.
*18:13.220- 18:18.940* :  Today, the trial has begun of the former health minister and dozens of others accused of fraud
*18:18.940- 18:25.040* :  involving COVID testing kits. Here's two boy from the BBC's Vietnamese Service.
*18:50.040- 18:57.060* :  And also a former Hanoi Chairman accused of taking around $100,000 US dollars as
*18:57.640- 19:03.980* :  greater attention. Thank you, money. And this trial is expected to last 20 days with around 38
*19:03.980- 19:07.720* :  defendants. And what's the reaction being from the public there?
*19:09.780- 19:15.640* :  So the court case angles the public a lot as it happened during the hardest time of the country,
*19:16.300- 19:22.320* :  during the pandemic. And people are just speed less of the corruption and how big the money is
*19:22.320- 19:30.100* :  corrupted. Because people expected the official, especially the health minister,
*19:30.100- 19:37.600* :  are supposed to protect their life. But they can't deal corrupt during COVID time and through
*19:37.600- 19:43.820* :  the disqualified death kits. And the public now is losing their confidence in the government.
*19:44.620- 19:48.060* :  And is this part of a wider campaign of anti-corruption from the government?
*19:48.760- 19:54.720* :  Yeah, you're right. We can observe that the big case like this, big trial like this in the very
*19:54.720- 20:03.080* :  first day of New Year is a part of anti-corruption campaign, uh, lived by the general secretariat of
*20:03.080- 20:09.420* :  the Communist Party. And even now he is 80 years old, but he's still determined to punish
*20:09.420- 20:15.040* :  corrupt party members. And this trial in the very first day of New Year, you know,
*20:15.040- 20:22.320* :  plays at deterrence to all the party members. And the Communist Party once warned that corruption
*20:22.320- 20:30.080* :  may jeopardize its public legitimacy and determine the grip on power. So that's why they
*20:30.180- 20:36.160* :  harsh on this case of corruption. Two boy from the BBC's Vietnamese service.
*20:39.040- 20:40.300* :  Still to come on this podcast.
*20:45.220- 20:48.360* :  Why you may be more of a chicken whisperer than you think.
*20:56.320- 21:02.620* :  Back in 2016, the Philippines newly elected president Rodrigo Deterte announced his
*21:02.620- 21:08.320* :  controversial war on drugs in the years that followed more than 6,000 people were killed by
*21:08.320- 21:14.280* :  the police in anti-drug operations, although some believed the figure to be much higher. His
*21:14.280- 21:19.980* :  successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who came to power last year, set his approach to tackling drugs
*21:19.980- 21:26.640* :  would be less violent, but as Linda Presley reports, the killings have continued. And one case
*21:26.860- 21:34.100* :  has become emblematic of the problem. In the waterside neighborhood of Navottas in the north of
*21:34.100- 21:39.500* :  Metro Manila, people are still reeling from the daylight shooting of a 17-year-old fisherman by
*21:39.500- 21:45.220* :  the police in August last year. Vincent Goe is a seasoned news photographer who's covered the
*21:45.220- 21:52.160* :  bloody drug war since 2016. He arrived here after Geraud Balthazar, known as Gemboy, was gunned down
*21:52.160- 21:58.500* :  and fell into the water in a fatal case of mistaken identity. That day the police were supposed to be
*21:58.940- 22:04.280* :  looking for a murder suspect when they arrived and somebody pointed that the suspect is hiding in
*22:04.280- 22:10.960* :  that boat. So they saw two people on the boat. It was Gemboy and his friend and immediately
*22:10.980- 22:16.560* :  they started yelling and immediately opened fire on the two of them. And Gemboy and his friend
*22:16.560- 22:23.180* :  were just cleaning the boat, right? They were preparing the boat to go out to fish. So his body was
*22:23.180- 22:29.840* :  left underwater. The police didn't even see if he was still alive or tried to retrieve the body.
*22:30.580- 22:35.560* :  Shockingly, it was Gemboy's uncle who finally fished his nephew's corpse out of the water.
*22:36.180- 22:40.880* :  Gemboy's remains were removed to the Philippine General Hospital, where Dr. Raquel Fortun,
*22:40.880- 22:46.960* :  one of only two forensic pathologists in the country, was waiting in the morgue. In her office with
*22:46.960- 22:52.960* :  the aid of a plastic model skull, Dr. Fortun demonstrates where one of the bullets hit Gemboy's head.
*22:53.420- 22:59.940* :  So it entered here, but it did not really cause death outright.
*23:00.360- 23:06.220* :  The point is if the police had pulled Gemboy out of the water, potentially he could have survived.
*23:07.220- 23:11.480* :  In the days that followed the post-mortem, Dr. Fortun had two unwelcome visits
*23:11.480- 23:16.160* :  from the police and from the prosecutor. They wanted her autopsy report.
*23:16.260- 23:23.240* :  I said, this is enough. I'm being harassed. I'm active on Twitter and so I posted.
*23:23.240- 23:29.580* :  She told her 170,000 followers about the visits, adding she was putting the information out there
*23:29.580- 23:34.740* :  for whatever protection that might give her. In the Philippines, the assassination of public figures
*23:34.740- 23:41.460* :  isn't unheard of. So this is the Department of Justice and we've got an appointment with
*23:41.460- 23:48.280* :  Assistant Secretary Mico Clavano. The killing of Gemboy has become one of a tiny handful of cases
*23:48.280- 23:53.480* :  where police officers in the Philippines are being held to account. Six of them have been charged
*23:53.480- 23:59.940* :  with murder and are now awaiting their day in court. The Assistant Secretary says Gemboy's case
*23:59.940- 24:04.660* :  has hastened reform so that prosecutors will in future work more closely with the police,
*24:04.660- 24:11.340* :  visiting crime scenes. The police were left alone on the field and that's how
*24:11.340- 24:18.020* :  all these abuses have happened. So this is our way of sort of doing a check-and-balance with
*24:18.020- 24:24.320* :  the police. That may be, but drug-related killings haven't stopped. In fact, according to researchers
*24:24.320- 24:29.380* :  at the University of the Philippines, more deaths were recorded in the first year of President
*24:29.380- 24:35.520* :  Marcos's rule than during the last year President Duterte was in power. Linda Pressley,
*24:36.600- 24:41.520* :  last year saw a heightening of tension between China and Taiwan, and China's
*24:41.520- 24:48.240* :  presidents has begun 2024 with a signal that things are not going to ease. It is new year message,
*24:48.240- 24:55.720* :  Xi Jinping reiterated his claim that Taiwan would surely be unified with China. This comes
*24:55.720- 25:00.880* :  ahead of Taiwan's elections this month that will determine the island's cross-straight policy
*25:00.880- 25:06.500* :  for the next four years. Meanwhile, Taiwan is extending compulsory military service
*25:06.500- 25:12.120* :  to one year from four months starting this year, due to the rising threat the democratically
*25:12.120- 25:17.560* :  governed island faces from its neighbour, who sees Taiwan as a breakaway province.
*25:17.620- 25:24.060* :  My colleague Ed Butler has been to Taiwan to see how they are preparing for any potential conflict.
*25:31.060- 25:35.860* :  An old Taiwanese gun in placement. It's like a bunker, a concrete bunker.
*25:37.980- 25:42.380* :  You can hear the walls above my head. It's hardly high enough for me to stand.
*25:43.860- 25:47.980* :  To my right is a little shine, a little incense burner, presumably left here by soldiers.
*25:48.960- 25:54.380* :  There are walls on each side, and in front of me you can see the spikes pointing out towards the
*25:54.380- 26:02.800* :  sea at a torrent to any invading force. This was built in the 50s when there was a really hot
*26:02.800- 26:10.340* :  wall between here and China. Shells were flying over by the thousand each week. Since then the heat
*26:10.340- 26:16.980* :  has somewhat lessened in terms of military conflict, but the threats are ramping up once again.
*26:23.020- 26:29.280* :  Regular staged military drills, just like this one, are meant to show that Taipei and its allies
*26:29.280- 26:34.160* :  are serious about confronting any potential Chinese military assault head on.
*26:38.060- 26:42.500* :  Taiwanese troops, fires, smoke grenades, planes take off and land, tanks
*26:42.500- 26:48.760* :  trundle forward with scurrying soldiers running behind. But how meaningful are exercises like
*26:48.760- 26:54.420* :  this? Given that just across the Taiwan Strait, Beijing is organizing its own far bigger drills,
*26:54.840- 27:00.760* :  backed by a $300 billion military budget and a two million strong army.
*27:01.900- 27:08.480* :  Well, if they really want to start a war to take over Taiwan, I think it's just the matter of time.
*27:09.760- 27:15.380* :  They will win. I think they will. I'm not rooting for them, but it's just the fact.
*27:15.960- 27:21.800* :  That's Jason, a 30-year-old IT worker who, like all Taiwanese men, has had to undergo compulsory
*27:21.800- 27:27.540* :  military service just four months of it in his case. Well, Taiwan's government itself points out
*27:27.540- 27:33.300* :  that it's increasing compulsory military service for men from four months to one year, although
*27:33.300- 27:38.980* :  that number is still much less than other countries like Israel or South Korea, for example.
*27:39.500- 27:45.200* :  The US is now supplementing Taiwan's defense budget with direct grants, but even former Taiwanese
*27:45.200- 27:51.820* :  generals say that in military terms, the island is woefully ill-prepared. Of course, no one on the
*27:51.820- 27:57.180* :  island wants war. The question now is, though, whether the government's current defiant posture towards
*27:57.540- 28:04.080* :  Beijing is deterring a possible conflict or, as the opposition parties claim, is adding to the risks.
*28:04.080- 28:10.360* :  This is how the KMT candidate, Ho Yu Yi, put it, when my translator Shin and I heard him speak
*28:10.800- 28:12.940* :  at a recent presidential election rally.
*28:21.780- 28:27.920* :  He mentioned about cross-strait tension and how it plays a crucial role in this election,
*28:28.800- 28:36.340* :  and his attitude is that we want to do everything we can to avoid war, and we will prepare,
*28:36.960- 28:44.120* :  but not to the extent that we attract war. And he believes that he is the only candidate who
*28:44.120- 28:50.160* :  has been really upfront about his attitude towards the China- and Taiwan relationship,
*28:50.160- 28:57.240* :  that he thinks that any politician or any presidential candidate who supported Taiwanese
*28:57.240- 29:02.440* :  independence will attract war. That report from Ed Butler in Taiwan,
*29:03.480- 29:09.800* :  Do you think you could spot a chicken in distress? A new study from a university in Australia shows
*29:09.800- 29:16.720* :  that humans could be fairly effective chicken whisperers. Participants were tasked with identifying
*29:16.720- 29:22.560* :  how the birds were feeling just by the sound of their clocks. Researchers believe the results
*29:22.560- 29:27.000* :  could improve the welfare of farm chickens. Madeline Dury has more.
*29:32.000- 29:35.380* :  Have a guess. Is this chicken excited or displeased?
*29:38.940- 29:44.480* :  This is known as a gackle call and often indicates frustration. It's one of the four types of
*29:44.520- 29:49.720* :  sound that was played by researchers at Australia's University of Queensland to test whether humans could
*29:49.720- 29:55.800* :  correctly identify the context of calls or clicking sounds made by domestic chickens. The most
*29:55.800- 30:02.020* :  commonly found species in the world. They found that 69% of people got it right and could tell whether
*30:02.020- 30:07.080* :  a chicken made sounds in a rewarded context, such as when they were excited about mealworms for dinner,
*30:07.600- 30:13.620* :  or non-the-ordered context like a disappointing empty bowl. This ability wasn't influenced by
*30:13.620- 30:19.180* :  the participant's past experience in chicken cubes, so researchers say it suggests cross-species
*30:19.180- 30:25.780* :  call recognition may just be wired into us. And the results says research a Professor Yurg Henning
*30:26.120- 30:31.680* :  could make for happier hands in future. If further research can give us a better understanding of how
*30:31.680- 30:38.200* :  humans interpret their calls, it could be used to teach artificial intelligence. Detection systems
*30:38.200- 30:43.420* :  could help breeders monitor and improve the birds' welfare. Professor Hennings also says this could
*30:43.420- 30:48.400* :  assist conscientious consumers in making more informed decisions on their supermarket shop.
*30:50.380- 30:56.240* :  Madeline Dury reporting. Now to an unusual find in Wales. A set of graves,
*30:56.240- 31:03.220* :  1,500 years old were archaeologists of finding evidence about how an early medieval community lived,
*31:03.220- 31:09.160* :  died and were buried. But the skeletons posed some puzzling questions for the research team.
*31:09.760- 31:14.120* :  Our science editor Rebecca Morrell went to visit the dig in the Welsh Capital Cardiff.
*31:16.580- 31:21.080* :  Just outside of Cardiff, archaeologists are unearthing a medieval mystery.
*31:21.080- 31:27.320* :  And it's the West Spaces section. They've discovered a graveyard they think is 1,500 years old.
*31:27.320- 31:32.320* :  The bodies buried so long ago are giving an insight into a period we know little about.
*31:32.320- 31:35.380* :  This is your upper drawer area, to your maxilla, your top teeth.
*31:35.640- 31:41.960* :  Summer courts from the University of Reading is carefully excavating one of the remarkably well-preserved skeletons.
*31:41.960- 31:48.320* :  As bones get cleaned, we'll find some pathologies that can tell us about health. Tell us in some cases
*31:48.320- 31:54.060* :  about work. We have some teeth that are very worn in kind of a funny way. That might indicate
*31:54.060- 31:59.420* :  the use of teeth as tools, maybe for textile work, leather work, basketry,
*31:59.560- 32:03.600* :  some where they're pulling something through their front teeth. We'll have a really good not only
*32:03.600- 32:11.760* :  life history of these people, but also a community history. Everywhere you look, there are graves
*32:12.340- 32:18.520* :  carved out of the bedrock. The team have excavated 18 of them so far. Now they're all in roughly
*32:19.300- 32:27.220* :  an east-west orientation. And in some of them, the skeletons are totally laid out flat on the
*32:27.220- 32:32.640* :  backs of their legs outstretched. But in others, which is much more unusual, the skeletons are in a
*32:32.740- 32:41.320* :  crouching position. Why this is isn't clear, with burial practices changing over time,
*32:41.320- 32:46.860* :  or was there something else marking out these people as different? But it's not just the skeletons
*32:46.860- 32:53.060* :  baffling the team. What's being found alongside them is also posing a puzzle. Got something that
*32:53.060- 33:01.180* :  looks like glass. A shard of fine French glass has just been discovered. It's a rimshard. Probably
*33:01.180- 33:06.060* :  the rim from a cone beaker, so it's sort of looked like a nice cream cone. They well preserved
*33:06.060- 33:12.180* :  glass. Most likely associated with the consumption of wine. Probably was imported alongside wine
*33:12.180- 33:19.100* :  in barrels from the Bordeaux region of France. A really nice fine. Andy Seaman from Cardiff University
*33:19.100- 33:25.640* :  is leading this excavation. There's an array of artifacts being found from fragments of pottery,
*33:25.640- 33:32.540* :  perhaps from North Africa, and a tiny carved peg. This is the object, is manufactured from
*33:32.540- 33:38.400* :  animal bone. Could be a peg for a gaming board. Okay, kind of cribbage or some sort of game.
*33:38.400- 33:45.760* :  Yes, yes. Medieval version. Yeah, something like that. Andy says the discoveries suggest people
*33:45.760- 33:51.220* :  were coming to the cemetery to meet up and socialise, the living and the dead, existing together.
*33:51.520- 33:56.900* :  We tend to think of graveyards as sort of enclosed spaces that we don't really go to,
*33:57.520- 34:02.400* :  but they probably would have been quite central to life in the past. And it's not just the place
*34:02.400- 34:06.220* :  where people are being buried, but it's a place where communities are coming together,
*34:06.220- 34:10.960* :  they are burying their dead, but they're also undertaking other forms of activity and social
*34:10.960- 34:16.340* :  practice, including eating and drinking and feasting. Andy Seaman speaking to our science editor,
*34:16.660- 34:22.840* :  Rebecca Morrell. As I'm sure you're aware, Taylor Swift was everywhere in 2023.
*34:23.620- 34:30.500* :  Her era's concert tour brought in a record breaking $1 billion in sales after only 60 shows.
*34:31.180- 34:38.080* :  According to CBS, she was also the most downloaded artist globally on Spotify. And here in the UK,
*34:38.080- 34:43.840* :  it was no different. She was the most streamed artist of the year. Her presence helped to make it the
*34:43.840- 34:49.780* :  most successful year ever for female musicians in Britain. So, who else was making the grade?
*34:50.360- 34:52.600* :  Here's our music correspondent, Mark Savage.
*34:55.580- 35:02.220* :  Flowers by Miley Cyrus was streamed nearly 200 million times in 2023, making it the year's
*35:02.220- 35:07.500* :  biggest single. Another six of the year's top 10 best sellers were by female artists,
*35:08.160- 35:11.500* :  including songs by Pink Panther S, Sizzah and Taylor Swift.
*35:16.440- 35:21.340* :  In the album chart, new music was eclipsed by greatest hits collections, which accounted for
*35:21.340- 35:26.800* :  half of the top 10. The Canadian star, the weekend, was at number one with his best off album
*35:26.800- 35:36.100* :  called The Highlights. The only new release in the top 10 was Taylor Swift's 1989,
*35:36.340- 35:41.700* :  and even that was a re-recorded version of an album originally issued in 2014.
*35:48.480- 35:53.140* :  And that's all for most for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
*35:53.800- 35:56.980* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*35:57.300- 36:04.620* :  you can send us an email. The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on
*36:04.620- 36:10.820* :  x, formerly known as Twitter, at Global NewsPod. This addition was mixed by Craig Kingham,
*36:10.820- 36:17.200* :  the producer was Stephanie Prentice, and the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nigel Adely. Until next time,
*36:17.520- 36:17.720* :  goodbye.
