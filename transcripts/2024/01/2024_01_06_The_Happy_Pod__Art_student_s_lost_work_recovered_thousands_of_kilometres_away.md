*01:47.880- 01:52.960* :  our first one of 2024, uploaded on Saturday, January 6th,
*01:53.180- 01:57.620* :  the Pakistani photographer, who reunited a British artist with the portfolio
*01:57.620- 01:59.220* :  she thought she'd lost forever.
*02:00.060- 02:02.860* :  I know how much anarchists love their work.
*02:03.100- 02:05.980* :  If she cannot throw them away after doing so much hard work,
*02:06.460- 02:08.020* :  I just had to find her.
*02:08.180- 02:11.440* :  And I was just like, oh my god, this can't be real.
*02:11.740- 02:14.020* :  Because I thought at first I thought it was like a scam.
*02:14.380- 02:15.140* :  From Australia,
*02:15.560- 02:18.240* :  and it calculated the percentage of the battery that we would use,
*02:18.240- 02:20.840* :  it would probably give us three days with the machine.
*02:20.840- 02:22.500* :  We'd try to, and it worked.
*02:23.080- 02:27.380* :  The parents who used their electric car to power their son's dialysis machine,
*02:28.240- 02:32.540* :  the Hawaiian jewelers using their skills to restore precious belongings damaged
*02:32.540- 02:34.240* :  in the Maui wildfires.
*02:34.240- 02:37.220* :  You see that transformation of attitude,
*02:37.220- 02:40.220* :  and you see their happiness just right in front of you.
*02:40.660- 02:41.920* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:42.260- 02:46.300* :  It's been crazy, I slept for two hours, but last night it was just,
*02:46.940- 02:49.640* :  it was good to be involved in a good final, me and Luke played really well.
*02:50.100- 02:54.080* :  Luke the nuke, the teenager who got into the World Darts Championship,
*02:54.660- 02:55.500* :  and became a star.
*03:01.320- 03:05.140* :  And let's start with the story of art, of loss, of generosity,
*03:05.140- 03:08.920* :  and tremendous good luck, all over thousands of kilometres.
*03:09.680- 03:11.500* :  It begins with a student's worst nightmare,
*03:11.500- 03:16.260* :  the vital portfolio that Grace Hart hoped would get her into a UK fashion school
*03:16.260- 03:18.560* :  was somehow accidentally thrown away.
*03:19.080- 03:21.140* :  Gone, banished, never to be seen again.
*03:21.140- 03:26.420* :  But that was to reckon without Pakistani fashion photographer Tatwa Munir.
*03:26.860- 03:28.080* :  Harry Blight takes up the story.
*03:29.060- 03:33.000* :  Grace Hart was in the process of applying to university to study fashion,
*03:33.440- 03:34.640* :  and as part of her application,
*03:34.640- 03:37.780* :  she was going to send a portfolio of her artwork.
*03:38.300- 03:41.640* :  However, her mother Sonja thought she'd accidentally thrown it away.
*03:41.960- 03:44.140* :  We were all in a bit of a frenzy in the house,
*03:44.280- 03:47.940* :  because we were trying to find these artworks.
*03:48.520- 03:52.460* :  We then realised that they must have been taken out as rubbish,
*03:53.000- 03:55.040* :  because at the time we were having a big clean out as well.
*03:55.280- 03:59.580* :  But then a year later, Grace unexpectedly received a message on Instagram,
*03:59.580- 04:02.480* :  from a man in the Pakistani city of Lahore.
*04:02.660- 04:05.580* :  He sent me photos of all my work that I'd lost,
*04:05.760- 04:09.060* :  and I was just like, oh my god, this can't be real.
*04:09.360- 04:11.600* :  Because I thought at first I thought it was like a scam,
*04:11.600- 04:14.000* :  and he'd just screenshot it things off my Instagram.
*04:14.060- 04:17.940* :  But no, he'd found them in a thrift bookstore.
*04:18.420- 04:21.000* :  Tatwa Munir, a well-known photographer in Pakistan,
*04:21.000- 04:23.340* :  had found her artwork and bought it.
*04:23.600- 04:26.780* :  There was a box which had three of these sketchbooks,
*04:27.500- 04:30.300* :  and which had amazing, amazing artwork.
*04:30.920- 04:31.800* :  You won't believe it.
*04:31.800- 04:34.580* :  They costed me for less than $1.
*04:35.520- 04:36.040* :  Three of them.
*04:36.660- 04:39.800* :  I was like, oh my god, I'm so lucky, I just got it treasure.
*04:40.340- 04:44.080* :  And my initial plan was to get those artworks
*04:44.140- 04:45.880* :  and get them framed for my house.
*04:46.280- 04:47.900* :  Though delighted with his find,
*04:47.960- 04:50.740* :  Tatwa was suspicious about the price.
*04:50.780- 04:54.300* :  He could see that a great deal of skill, time and effort
*04:54.300- 04:56.240* :  had gone into these paintings and sketches,
*04:56.800- 04:59.580* :  and began to think that perhaps they hadn't just been donated,
*05:00.320- 05:01.940* :  but instead were lost.
*05:02.160- 05:05.140* :  I know how much anarchists love their work.
*05:05.560- 05:08.360* :  She had done pencil sketches, watercolors,
*05:08.920- 05:10.380* :  and like every form of art.
*05:10.380- 05:13.100* :  And I was like, she must need them.
*05:13.100- 05:16.320* :  Like, she cannot throw them away after doing so much artwork.
*05:17.120- 05:18.720* :  I just had to find her.
*05:19.120- 05:20.000* :  And he did.
*05:20.460- 05:21.760* :  The name was written on the top.
*05:21.760- 05:22.960* :  The name was Grace Hart.
*05:23.720- 05:25.740* :  And luckily I found her on Instagram.
*05:26.000- 05:28.620* :  And I dropped her message with the pictures
*05:28.620- 05:30.400* :  of the sketchbooks I had.
*05:30.420- 05:33.580* :  And I was like, did you throw these intentionally
*05:33.640- 05:36.100* :  or like, have you lost them or something?
*05:36.720- 05:38.720* :  And the rest is history, yeah.
*05:39.160- 05:41.020* :  The artwork arrived at Grace's home
*05:41.040- 05:42.600* :  in the English town of Rugby,
*05:42.600- 05:45.720* :  6400 kilometers from Lahore.
*05:45.800- 05:48.000* :  I didn't get them for a little while.
*05:48.040- 05:50.940* :  I'm obviously quite expensive coming from all the way over there,
*05:51.580- 05:52.920* :  but obviously it's worth it.
*05:53.100- 05:55.920* :  Both Grace and Tatwa say they have no idea
*05:56.200- 05:57.640* :  how it ended up in Pakistan.
*05:58.060- 06:00.540* :  I think she accepted that she has lost them.
*06:00.540- 06:02.660* :  And she had no hope that she would find it again.
*06:03.180- 06:05.000* :  But she was obviously really surprised.
*06:05.260- 06:06.660* :  And she was just asking questions
*06:06.660- 06:08.000* :  at how did it get there.
*06:08.400- 06:10.980* :  And to be honest, I also didn't have the right answer
*06:10.980- 06:12.680* :  that how it ended up here.
*06:13.200- 06:15.960* :  Grace was grateful to receive her missing art
*06:15.960- 06:18.300* :  in the post all the way from Pakistan.
*06:18.920- 06:20.800* :  She had this advice for others
*06:20.860- 06:23.520* :  who've lost something precious in their house.
*06:25.820- 06:29.520* :  Probably just take better care of it than I did.
*06:31.000- 06:35.820* :  And my mum said as well to maybe check bin bags
*06:35.820- 06:36.980* :  before you throw them out.
*06:38.120- 06:40.500* :  That was Grace Hart ending that report by Harry Blight.
*06:40.500- 06:42.860* :  And he will be back a little later in the podcast.
*06:43.640- 06:45.580* :  Now, when Christie and Jared Holmes
*06:45.580- 06:48.240* :  from the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia
*06:48.240- 06:49.700* :  bought their electric car,
*06:50.160- 06:52.300* :  they were delighted that they were able to charge it
*06:52.300- 06:54.460* :  mainly during the day by solar power.
*06:55.040- 06:58.420* :  But little did they realise just how useful it would prove
*06:58.420- 07:00.680* :  to be when terrible storms hit the region
*07:01.220- 07:04.000* :  and jeopardised their son's vital medical treatment.
*07:04.740- 07:05.820* :  Christie told us what happened.
*07:06.720- 07:10.060* :  They've actually classed it as a category through tornado.
*07:10.920- 07:13.180* :  There are spots in neighbouring communities
*07:13.180- 07:15.140* :  where you can see where the tornado is actually like
*07:15.140- 07:16.460* :  touched down on the ground.
*07:17.160- 07:18.640* :  Shredded trees like in a blender.
*07:19.480- 07:21.500* :  And then to put it up and going again
*07:21.540- 07:25.940* :  because either side the trees are still in perfect condition.
*07:26.880- 07:29.220* :  Our neighbours had trees through their roofs
*07:29.300- 07:32.540* :  and that's as down trees hit cars
*07:32.560- 07:34.420* :  and smashed them up and things like that.
*07:35.180- 07:38.420* :  And a lot of people lost power, didn't they?
*07:39.060- 07:41.780* :  A lot of people only got power back like today
*07:41.780- 07:43.380* :  or still have no power.
*07:44.100- 07:46.080* :  I just see from like our community Facebook group
*07:46.180- 07:48.760* :  people are saying, oh, he's such and such power back on yet.
*07:48.760- 07:52.820* :  So yeah, which is incredibly difficult
*07:53.280- 07:54.840* :  for anybody in any situation.
*07:55.560- 07:57.960* :  But you had another worry, didn't you,
*07:58.380- 07:59.560* :  the health of your son Levi?
*08:00.740- 08:01.320* :  Yes, we did.
*08:01.460- 08:04.860* :  So Levi, he, since birth, his 11th and since birth,
*08:04.860- 08:06.060* :  he's had renal failure.
*08:08.060- 08:09.140* :  Until he gets a transplant,
*08:09.140- 08:12.100* :  he will be on the dialysis machine every night.
*08:12.100- 08:14.660* :  It takes about six to seven hours every night
*08:14.700- 08:16.680* :  and he got a night off on Christmas night.
*08:17.160- 08:20.740* :  Just for a bit of a treat and also because his body can handle
*08:21.700- 08:22.980* :  having a night off every now and then,
*08:23.000- 08:24.300* :  which is good for an 11-year-old
*08:24.300- 08:28.380* :  because that way he gets to still have a sleep over with mates
*08:28.380- 08:29.680* :  or feel a bit normal.
*08:30.160- 08:32.820* :  So he does get the occasional night off
*08:33.100- 08:35.360* :  but it's only the occasional night off
*08:35.400- 08:37.500* :  and you need power for dialysis.
*08:37.660- 08:38.740* :  So what did you do?
*08:39.140- 08:39.280* :  Yes.
*08:39.740- 08:42.980* :  So his machine, some people have a backup battery for
*08:43.300- 08:43.700* :  different machines.
*08:43.700- 08:45.440* :  We don't have one of those machines.
*08:46.040- 08:48.140* :  Bows needs to be plugged into power at all times.
*08:48.900- 08:50.700* :  So on Christmas night, it was okay
*08:50.700- 08:51.780* :  because we just thought, oh,
*08:51.780- 08:53.520* :  we know it might be out for a couple of hours.
*08:53.980- 08:56.380* :  The next day when our fridges were off
*08:56.420- 08:57.200* :  and everything like that,
*08:57.200- 09:01.100* :  we actually used the car to plug in the fridges at first
*09:01.100- 09:04.660* :  and freezes and that of our neighbors as well.
*09:04.840- 09:06.240* :  So we had about eight fridges,
*09:06.360- 09:09.940* :  including camping fridges just to preserve people's food.
*09:10.400- 09:13.000* :  And it came probably into the afternoon
*09:13.180- 09:14.080* :  and we were thinking,
*09:14.080- 09:16.280* :  leaf I need to have his dialysis tonight.
*09:16.500- 09:17.820* :  And what are we going to do?
*09:18.280- 09:19.540* :  And rather than drive to Brisbane,
*09:19.540- 09:20.400* :  which was an hour away
*09:20.440- 09:22.660* :  and we're also having warnings not to drive.
*09:22.980- 09:26.020* :  So we weren't to be on the roads or in the cars
*09:26.020- 09:28.440* :  or anything while it was like severe weather.
*09:28.900- 09:31.340* :  So my husband Jared, he said,
*09:31.340- 09:33.600* :  oh, let's see if we can set his machine up.
*09:33.800- 09:34.860* :  You know, we've plugged the fridges in
*09:34.860- 09:37.540* :  and it wasn't using so much power.
*09:37.540- 09:40.120* :  And yeah, we just plugged the machine in
*09:40.120- 09:41.920* :  and he said all the machine up and it was fine.
*09:42.160- 09:44.360* :  And then he calculated the percentage of the battery
*09:44.360- 09:45.000* :  that we would use.
*09:45.000- 09:47.600* :  It would probably give us three days with the machine.
*09:47.600- 09:49.980* :  So we just did it.
*09:50.140- 09:51.320* :  We tried it and it worked.
*09:52.400- 09:53.680* :  And just a key question.
*09:53.680- 09:55.440* :  How is Levi at the moment?
*09:55.660- 09:58.380* :  What did he make of the fact that his treatment
*09:58.380- 10:00.560* :  was being powered by family car?
*10:01.160- 10:03.180* :  He was, Levi's, Levi's,
*10:03.540- 10:05.260* :  like, he's not really faced by too much.
*10:05.300- 10:05.840* :  He's a gamer.
*10:05.840- 10:08.200* :  So I know it's a reality,
*10:08.200- 10:10.160* :  but with kids these days,
*10:10.660- 10:12.280* :  reality isn't really shocking, is it?
*10:12.940- 10:14.480* :  Yeah, so he's like, that's cool.
*10:14.980- 10:16.920* :  He's not phased, but does he realize
*10:16.920- 10:18.980* :  how resourceful his parents are?
*10:19.480- 10:22.580* :  Is he grateful for how resourceful his parents are?
*10:23.420- 10:24.500* :  I'm pretty sure he is.
*10:24.500- 10:27.960* :  Like he kind of knows that the mom and dad
*10:27.960- 10:31.400* :  would like basically just about do anything to get
*10:31.420- 10:32.340* :  what we need for him.
*10:32.340- 10:35.060* :  And yeah, I'm pretty sure he knows that.
*10:35.420- 10:37.960* :  He knows he's like, you have us resourceful parents.
*10:39.260- 10:40.960* :  That was Christie Holmes in Australia.
*10:41.760- 10:43.700* :  To Hong Kong now and a project to promote
*10:43.700- 10:46.660* :  bio-diversity, reduce pollution in the city's base
*10:46.660- 10:48.780* :  and restore damaged ecosystems,
*10:49.560- 10:51.780* :  all with old oyster shells collected
*10:51.780- 10:53.060* :  from restaurants and hotels.
*10:53.840- 10:55.680* :  Baden Russell, associate director
*10:55.880- 10:57.520* :  of the University of Hong Kong's
*10:57.520- 10:59.520* :  Sui Institute of Marine Science,
*10:59.540- 11:01.560* :  told us more about the importance of oysters.
*11:02.520- 11:06.740* :  We've almost forgotten historically why oysters matter
*11:07.020- 11:09.860* :  because they used to make these massive ecosystems.
*11:10.900- 11:14.640* :  And when we let them grow in a natural setting,
*11:14.880- 11:16.100* :  oysters form reefs.
*11:16.500- 11:18.600* :  And so everyone knows about coral reefs.
*11:18.600- 11:20.980* :  Well, oysters form reefs as well.
*11:21.600- 11:24.340* :  But they tend to do it in the muddy sort of waters.
*11:25.200- 11:27.600* :  But that's actually one of the big things about them
*11:27.600- 11:30.460* :  is that they increase bio-diversity.
*11:30.460- 11:31.880* :  They clean up the water.
*11:32.080- 11:33.520* :  And they also protect coastlines.
*11:33.520- 11:36.000* :  So we're all worried about increasing
*11:36.000- 11:37.560* :  storms with climate change.
*11:38.120- 11:40.700* :  If you've got oyster reefs on your coastline,
*11:40.700- 11:42.940* :  they'll protect us from those waves as well.
*11:43.500- 11:47.000* :  And so this new program, they're literally partnering
*11:47.000- 11:48.120* :  with restaurants.
*11:48.140- 11:50.000* :  And so when people are eating oysters,
*11:50.620- 11:54.020* :  rather than those shells going into landfill,
*11:54.520- 11:55.720* :  we can use them for restoration.
*11:55.720- 11:58.180* :  We can build the ecosystems back.
*11:58.720- 12:02.140* :  How do you actually deploy them in the water?
*12:02.140- 12:04.960* :  I mean, you don't just pitch up in a big old ship
*12:05.000- 12:06.160* :  and tip them over the side.
*12:06.160- 12:11.700* :  How would you create or recreate reef with these shells?
*12:11.700- 12:12.720* :  How do you do it?
*12:13.760- 12:16.060* :  Well, so ironically, you were right.
*12:16.060- 12:19.920* :  You pitch up in a big old ship and then you throw them in.
*12:20.920- 12:22.680* :  They're kind of in an ordinary way.
*12:22.680- 12:26.340* :  So we know what sort of environments these reefs used to be.
*12:26.640- 12:31.020* :  And so we design sort of spatially the arrangement
*12:31.020- 12:35.300* :  of what we need so that we can maximize survival and growth.
*12:35.940- 12:38.740* :  And then you put them in that design.
*12:39.900- 12:41.920* :  And as you've indicated, none of this
*12:41.920- 12:44.340* :  is a particularly rapid process.
*12:45.160- 12:48.160* :  So when might we see some benefits?
*12:48.700- 12:49.740* :  How long does it take?
*12:49.740- 12:51.520* :  What sort of benefits do we see first?
*12:52.140- 12:54.480* :  So you get biodiversity of other organisms
*12:55.300- 12:56.380* :  increasing very rapidly.
*12:56.480- 12:58.140* :  Within the first two to three years,
*12:58.140- 13:01.500* :  you can have 10 times more species living there.
*13:02.080- 13:04.880* :  You very rapidly start to filter the water,
*13:04.880- 13:08.580* :  very rapidly increase the numbers of oysters that are there.
*13:08.720- 13:12.220* :  You can go from no oysters per square meter in the year one
*13:12.220- 13:16.080* :  to five or 600 per square meter within a couple of years.
*13:17.060- 13:19.280* :  So all of that happens very quickly.
*13:19.900- 13:22.180* :  But what we're discovering is that if you want
*13:22.660- 13:26.220* :  the peak ecosystems, services and functions,
*13:26.960- 13:29.800* :  you're talking 10 years or more before you really
*13:29.800- 13:30.620* :  start to see that.
*13:30.620- 13:34.860* :  So the supply of fish and crustaceans
*13:34.860- 13:37.000* :  like crabs into fisheries, that really
*13:37.000- 13:39.180* :  peaks after about 15 years.
*13:40.460- 13:44.360* :  So you've talked about needing patients for projects like this.
*13:44.380- 13:47.600* :  You've talked about overfishing and pollution
*13:47.660- 13:49.080* :  and all of those things.
*13:49.540- 13:53.060* :  You are working, though, in the sphere of solutions.
*13:53.820- 13:55.380* :  Are you by nature an optimist?
*13:56.660- 13:59.540* :  I actually think that I've evolved into an optimist.
*13:59.800- 14:03.800* :  I spent the first 15 years of my career doing research
*14:03.800- 14:06.100* :  which showed all of the different ways
*14:06.100- 14:10.300* :  in which human activities break the oceans and ecosystems.
*14:11.100- 14:13.180* :  But I kind of got sick of pointing out
*14:13.200- 14:16.300* :  where we were doing things wrong without actually
*14:16.880- 14:17.720* :  posing solutions.
*14:17.720- 14:22.020* :  And so I started working with the oyster restoration work.
*14:22.240- 14:23.800* :  And I've seen that we can make a difference.
*14:23.920- 14:28.580* :  And it's how people engage and how fast things can
*14:28.580- 14:30.800* :  happen once everyone comes together.
*14:31.820- 14:33.980* :  That was Baden Russell from the Sui Institute
*14:33.980- 14:37.120* :  of Marine Science at the University of Hong Kong.
*14:38.140- 14:40.300* :  Now you'll remember the deadly wildfires
*14:40.300- 14:42.560* :  on the Hawaiian island of Maui in August
*14:42.560- 14:45.840* :  that ripped through homes and destroyed people's belongings.
*14:46.620- 14:50.060* :  Now a jewelry shop on the island is fixing damaged
*14:50.060- 14:53.000* :  and burnt, precious items free of charge.
*14:53.600- 14:57.040* :  Harry Blyh spoke to the owners of Nocaoi Jewelry,
*14:57.040- 14:59.300* :  Omi, and Iarlete Chandi.
*14:59.800- 15:00.880* :  It was a strange evening.
*15:00.880- 15:03.640* :  When the fires were going on, we really had no clue
*15:03.640- 15:06.780* :  that such a fire was raging on the other side of the island.
*15:07.340- 15:09.020* :  We drove home and on the way home,
*15:09.020- 15:13.120* :  we saw different locations of fire along the way
*15:13.120- 15:14.400* :  to our place in Pula.
*15:14.900- 15:18.120* :  But luckily the winds took the fire in a different direction
*15:18.120- 15:19.780* :  and we were not harmed.
*15:20.420- 15:23.320* :  For the first week, we were just all kind of shocked
*15:23.320- 15:25.880* :  and people that we knew have lost everything.
*15:26.460- 15:27.440* :  We've noticed the island.
*15:27.440- 15:30.340* :  Everybody was really stepping up to do what they could
*15:30.340- 15:31.320* :  to help out.
*15:32.160- 15:33.720* :  You guys gave back to the community
*15:33.720- 15:37.960* :  by offering to fix and restore damaged jewelry.
*15:37.960- 15:40.800* :  So tell me, first of all, how did that come about?
*15:40.800- 15:44.200* :  But secondly, what can be done to restore
*15:44.200- 15:45.660* :  burnt metal and minerals?
*15:46.640- 15:49.480* :  To me, it was just, this is a perfect way for us
*15:49.700- 15:50.780* :  to give back and to help.
*15:51.160- 15:54.180* :  As far as the process, it could be a fairly simple process
*15:54.180- 15:57.140* :  depending on the damage of the piece
*15:57.440- 15:59.840* :  to a very intricate and very complicated process
*15:59.840- 16:02.140* :  that can take quite some time and quite some efforts.
*16:02.820- 16:06.300* :  So most items that are precious to the materials
*16:06.300- 16:08.720* :  actually come back almost brand new looking.
*16:09.720- 16:12.800* :  And how many items have you managed to save so far?
*16:14.440- 16:15.460* :  Oh, I hear.
*16:15.800- 16:18.700* :  Yeah, we're very happy to say we've saved quite a bit
*16:18.920- 16:21.720* :  and it's, you know, it's in the hundreds.
*16:21.720- 16:22.820* :  It's in the hundreds.
*16:22.820- 16:26.280* :  We've probably returned about 150 to 200 pieces.
*16:26.280- 16:28.480* :  There's still a few hundred pieces in the works.
*16:28.780- 16:30.700* :  Now, each one is really its own case.
*16:30.860- 16:34.060* :  We see people bringing their items in a Ziploc bag.
*16:35.080- 16:37.440* :  Completely loss of hope.
*16:37.720- 16:39.760* :  Didn't really know that these items can be restored.
*16:40.540- 16:43.120* :  And within a few weeks, they come back brand new
*16:43.320- 16:46.120* :  and to see that transformation of attitude
*16:46.120- 16:49.560* :  and transformation of you see there, you know, hope
*16:50.280- 16:52.100* :  and happiness just right in front of you.
*16:52.100- 16:55.700* :  It's quite touching.
*16:55.700- 16:58.460* :  It's really a beautiful, beautiful story.
*16:58.980- 17:01.220* :  Can you tell me about some of the people that you've helped?
*17:02.200- 17:04.040* :  Yesterday we had a story.
*17:04.040- 17:08.340* :  She was 85, and she found the ring
*17:08.340- 17:11.320* :  that her husband gave her 61 years ago.
*17:11.880- 17:12.060* :  Yes.
*17:12.340- 17:15.680* :  She was so happy yesterday when we bought it back
*17:15.680- 17:17.380* :  and it looked like when you...
*17:17.380- 17:20.600* :  Yeah, when she brought it in, it was like a piece of charcoal.
*17:20.820- 17:23.860* :  I mean, a piece of charcoal and just completely charred
*17:23.860- 17:26.540* :  and black, and it's quite something to see their faces
*17:26.540- 17:28.960* :  when we open up that piece of paper.
*17:29.580- 17:32.320* :  It's the only thing that you have left for my husband.
*17:33.480- 17:37.480* :  Why is this important to you to fix
*17:38.160- 17:40.120* :  and restore this jewelry free of charge?
*17:40.120- 17:41.960* :  Why is that important to you?
*17:42.740- 17:45.740* :  It's really a personal and a very emotional thing
*17:45.740- 17:47.820* :  to receive back after it's been lost.
*17:47.880- 17:51.240* :  So what's driving us is really the ratio
*17:51.240- 17:54.160* :  between the cost of doing it to what we get in return,
*17:54.900- 17:58.060* :  the benefits are so, I mean, they outweigh the cost.
*17:58.140- 18:00.480* :  So I think that's what keeps us going,
*18:00.480- 18:03.340* :  the rewarding feeling that we get with every piece
*18:03.340- 18:05.620* :  that we deliver and the piece of hope
*18:05.620- 18:07.480* :  that we offer to people,
*18:07.620- 18:10.200* :  we'll keep going until the last piece comes through.
*18:10.420- 18:13.900* :  You know, we see all the stages of the emotional spectrum
*18:14.560- 18:16.740* :  and we're seeing it live and it's here in our store
*18:16.840- 18:18.680* :  and it's just a beautiful blessing.
*18:18.680- 18:19.700* :  It's a beautiful blessing.
*18:20.600- 18:22.020* :  It makes us feel good too.
*18:22.780- 18:24.380* :  Omi and I let Chandi.
*18:24.580- 18:29.760* :  [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
*18:29.860- 18:33.440* :  Still to come, how do you build a hurricane-proof house?
*18:34.000- 18:36.340* :  And might the result look a little bit like Lego?
*18:36.920- 18:40.140* :  It is really the simplicity of it that you're alluding to,
*18:40.520- 18:43.100* :  which makes this so affordable and fast.
*18:43.100- 18:52.960* :  [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
*18:53.460- 18:55.780* :  Unmissible stories from around the globe.
*18:55.780- 19:00.020* :  If there's a war or an emergency happening to Taiwan,
*19:00.020- 19:02.600* :  then, you know, I would be as a part of it.
*19:02.600- 19:05.220* :  The documentary, gripping storytelling
*19:05.380- 19:07.320* :  from the BBC World Service.
*19:07.680- 19:09.360* :  This has been our life since childhood,
*19:10.080- 19:12.660* :  every year, worse and difficult events.
*19:12.660- 19:15.240* :  The documentary is a vantage point
*19:15.820- 19:18.240* :  from which to survey a new horizon.
*19:18.820- 19:22.420* :  Search for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*19:24.380- 19:27.320* :  Now, some of the other things that caught our eye recently,
*19:27.320- 19:29.980* :  this might prove to be very good news indeed,
*19:30.300- 19:34.020* :  reports this week of a new antibiotic developed by scientists
*19:34.020- 19:36.840* :  that Harvard and the pharmaceutical firm Roche,
*19:37.300- 19:40.440* :  which can fight dangerous drug-resistant bacteria.
*19:41.160- 19:43.780* :  Zosura Balpin is effective against
*19:43.840- 19:47.900* :  carbon-penem-resistant acid-nito-bacter Balmanii.
*19:48.280- 19:51.000* :  And yes, I have been practicing that, also known as Krab,
*19:51.000- 19:54.860* :  which can cause deadly, hitherto-untreetable infections.
*19:55.460- 19:56.540* :  But before we get too excited,
*19:56.540- 19:58.660* :  it is only working in mysofar.
*19:58.660- 20:00.280* :  Human trials haven't been done yet.
*20:00.640- 20:01.460* :  Still, promising.
*20:02.180- 20:04.640* :  And this is potentially an excellent story as well.
*20:04.640- 20:07.860* :  A new aviation company has developed a type of jet fuel
*20:08.400- 20:10.420* :  made entirely from human sewage.
*20:11.320- 20:15.160* :  Tests suggest that the Firefly Green Fuel's product
*20:15.160- 20:18.840* :  is nearly identical to standard fossil jet fuel,
*20:19.280- 20:21.400* :  but with a far lower carbon footprint.
*20:21.400- 20:23.180* :  Again, there is still a long way to go,
*20:23.180- 20:24.760* :  but the company is now raising funds
*20:24.760- 20:27.780* :  to build a full-scale demonstrator factory.
*20:28.340- 20:31.760* :  And congratulations to the record-breaking polar explorer,
*20:31.760- 20:35.300* :  Preet Chandi, who has completed another feat of endurance,
*20:35.300- 20:39.800* :  skiing alone almost 1,130 kilometers across Antarctica
*20:39.800- 20:42.540* :  from the edge of the landmast of the South Pole.
*20:42.980- 20:46.580* :  Her time, 31 days, 13 hours and 19 minutes,
*20:47.020- 20:49.640* :  looks set once confirmed to give her another record.
*20:49.680- 20:52.980* :  Captain Chandi, who is a serving British Army officer,
*20:53.500- 20:55.840* :  told us about her achievement, and how she's doing.
*20:56.880- 21:00.040* :  You know, I feel tired, I do, but I feel the best I felt
*21:00.500- 21:01.940* :  after any trip.
*21:01.960- 21:03.660* :  But I think a lot of that's learning as well.
*21:03.720- 21:05.640* :  So we learn from our previous mistakes.
*21:06.280- 21:07.940* :  I learned a lot from my last trip,
*21:07.940- 21:11.640* :  which was incredibly difficult and didn't go to plan at all.
*21:12.180- 21:15.040* :  And I felt to reach my end goal last time.
*21:15.040- 21:16.880* :  But I think this failure is important.
*21:16.940- 21:19.460* :  I'm glad I've had them, because I think they helped me
*21:19.820- 21:21.020* :  succeed this time round.
*21:21.360- 21:22.920* :  What was involved in it, per day?
*21:22.920- 21:24.180* :  How many hours did you ski?
*21:24.640- 21:27.920* :  About 13 hours a day, and I was super disciplined.
*21:28.160- 21:31.280* :  So I'd stop every hour for five minutes,
*21:31.920- 21:33.560* :  and have some water, have some food, and then
*21:33.580- 21:34.740* :  keep going next hour.
*21:34.900- 21:38.700* :  And generally, the last two hours could be pretty difficult,
*21:38.700- 21:40.860* :  but I would never let myself stop early.
*21:41.480- 21:43.300* :  I was having 5,000 calories a day,
*21:44.340- 21:46.960* :  and I still lost 10 kilograms, but that's about normal.
*21:47.280- 21:50.600* :  And making sure I got my sleep so I could keep going
*21:50.600- 21:51.180* :  the rest of the day.
*21:51.180- 21:55.000* :  So it was only really the last day that I kind of had
*21:55.000- 21:58.220* :  three and a half hours sleep to do my final 18 hour push.
*21:58.240- 22:00.080* :  Otherwise, I was getting 78 hours.
*22:00.560- 22:02.620* :  Did you know you were on track to beat the record?
*22:03.680- 22:05.700* :  I did, yes, yeah, for the first half.
*22:05.780- 22:09.420* :  I never really let myself think that I was definitely
*22:09.420- 22:11.220* :  going to get it, though, because things
*22:11.220- 22:14.600* :  happen, equipment might fail, or the weather could get worse.
*22:14.600- 22:17.160* :  So I just said to myself, just keep going,
*22:17.340- 22:20.680* :  keep working hard, keep the discipline up,
*22:20.840- 22:22.680* :  and hopefully it will all come together.
*22:23.420- 22:25.440* :  That was Captain Preet Chandy, and she was speaking
*22:25.440- 22:26.420* :  to Michelle Hussein.
*22:27.180- 22:28.840* :  Now, we heard a little earlier about the impact
*22:28.840- 22:30.860* :  of devastating storms in Australia.
*22:31.400- 22:34.160* :  A firm in Miami in the US has come up
*22:34.160- 22:36.380* :  with a new type of construction, but it says
*22:36.380- 22:38.500* :  it's far stronger than traditional methods,
*22:38.840- 22:41.240* :  and can withstand intensifying hurricanes
*22:41.300- 22:43.160* :  and other extreme weather events.
*22:44.040- 22:46.800* :  And the shape of the bricks might remind you of something
*22:46.800- 22:49.780* :  if you have children, or indeed used to be a child.
*22:50.420- 22:52.400* :  His Patrick Murphy of Renco, USA.
*22:53.660- 22:56.040* :  I was raised in a construction family,
*22:56.940- 23:01.160* :  and we partnered with an individual from Turkey
*23:01.160- 23:03.980* :  who had an idea to change the way we build
*23:04.340- 23:05.480* :  and change the material.
*23:06.060- 23:08.980* :  We are faster than traditional ways to build.
*23:09.560- 23:13.620* :  We are greener, 98% more green than concrete,
*23:14.360- 23:17.400* :  stronger than most other building methodologies.
*23:17.940- 23:20.980* :  It is lighter, cleaner, and quieter.
*23:21.480- 23:23.460* :  So, checks a lot of boxes.
*23:24.000- 23:26.700* :  We believe can help solve a lot of problems in the world
*23:26.700- 23:28.380* :  as it comes to affordable housing.
*23:29.140- 23:32.540* :  And what sort of materials are we talking about?
*23:32.540- 23:35.060* :  I understand that there's a lot of recycle material
*23:35.480- 23:36.360* :  in your bricks.
*23:37.160- 23:40.280* :  Yeah, so it's mainly recycled glass, recycled plastic,
*23:40.840- 23:42.640* :  calcite, which is like a limestone dust,
*23:42.720- 23:44.660* :  and then a resin that holds it all together.
*23:45.080- 23:46.020* :  That's like the glue.
*23:46.720- 23:48.560* :  And it's basically like a mold.
*23:48.560- 23:51.360* :  You mix all that stuff up, heat injected,
*23:51.860- 23:53.740* :  and it comes out into these blocks,
*23:53.740- 23:56.140* :  which can be configured into, basically, any size.
*23:57.040- 23:59.700* :  Now, I have to say, I have seen some pictures of these blocks.
*24:00.400- 24:04.380* :  And I have to ask, did you need to get permission
*24:04.380- 24:06.820* :  from a certain Danish toy manufacturer?
*24:09.980- 24:10.380* :  We did not.
*24:10.380- 24:13.920* :  It is really the simplicity of it that you're alluding to,
*24:14.320- 24:16.880* :  which makes this so affordable and fast,
*24:16.880- 24:19.360* :  because everyone played with Legos at some point.
*24:19.440- 24:23.020* :  And when we send the material to a job site to be built,
*24:23.020- 24:24.020* :  it's color-coded.
*24:24.680- 24:27.660* :  And each different size block has a different color
*24:27.840- 24:28.560* :  on the plans.
*24:29.080- 24:31.160* :  And you look at the plans, and you get the red one, boom.
*24:31.160- 24:32.360* :  You get the blue one, the green one,
*24:32.360- 24:33.460* :  just like you do as a kid.
*24:34.000- 24:35.000* :  And they stack together.
*24:35.880- 24:38.620* :  Are they literally in bright colors?
*24:39.740- 24:42.360* :  The blocks themselves are not, but on the plan.
*24:42.500- 24:43.380* :  Oh, that's a shame.
*24:43.420- 24:44.660* :  You've missed a trick there.
*24:45.460- 24:46.940* :  We've talked about it.
*24:47.920- 24:52.280* :  And because it's so relatively lightweight and easy to use
*24:53.080- 24:55.780* :  is it something that would be useful in places
*24:56.080- 24:58.300* :  that suffer from earthquakes and so on
*24:58.380- 25:01.260* :  to rebuild and provide replacement housing
*25:01.260- 25:02.620* :  when disasters have happened?
*25:03.840- 25:05.880* :  Yes, in fact, our partner is working
*25:05.880- 25:08.700* :  with the Turkish government after that devastating earthquake
*25:08.700- 25:12.960* :  last year to build hens of thousands of homes there.
*25:13.480- 25:16.160* :  So as we continue to grow, we definitely
*25:16.160- 25:18.720* :  want to start talking to more governments and agencies
*25:18.720- 25:21.060* :  to get this in front of them, because we
*25:21.060- 25:22.720* :  think it's a great solution, because you
*25:22.720- 25:25.900* :  don't have to fly in tens of thousands of skilled trades
*25:26.460- 25:28.920* :  people and heavy equipment to build this.
*25:29.260- 25:32.480* :  So in a disaster situation, when you're
*25:32.480- 25:34.920* :  going to rebuild the local workforce there,
*25:35.300- 25:36.540* :  can learn to do this themselves.
*25:36.940- 25:37.600* :  They get a job.
*25:37.600- 25:39.320* :  They're rebuilding their own community.
*25:39.780- 25:41.200* :  When you saw the first building
*25:41.200- 25:46.160* :  completed with your new product and your new building style
*25:46.160- 25:49.620* :  and material, what went through your head?
*25:51.080- 25:52.000* :  We're blown away.
*25:52.680- 25:54.900* :  To see the workers putting it up with no crane,
*25:54.900- 25:58.960* :  with no heavy equipment is also sort of awe-inspiring.
*25:58.960- 26:00.540* :  And it's just coming from the industry.
*26:00.540- 26:03.540* :  You always expect a bunch of waste and heavy noise
*26:03.780- 26:05.840* :  and concrete trucks and rebar.
*26:05.840- 26:10.340* :  And we had 11 workers erect these 96 unit
*26:10.340- 26:12.800* :  apartment building in a matter of days.
*26:13.500- 26:14.920* :  When you were little, did you play with Lego?
*26:15.460- 26:17.000* :  Of course, I still do.
*26:17.780- 26:19.220* :  Just bigger ones now.
*26:21.680- 26:23.880* :  That was Patrick Murphy of Renco, USA.
*26:25.240- 26:28.140* :  The World Darts Final doesn't traditionally
*26:28.140- 26:31.580* :  attract the sort of attention of football, cricket, or rugby.
*26:32.280- 26:33.860* :  But this year was something special,
*26:34.340- 26:36.840* :  thanks to the player who actually came second,
*26:36.860- 26:40.380* :  a teenager who's become known as Luke the Nuke.
*26:40.940- 26:46.540* :  The buzz began as Luke Littleer, who is 16, one round after round.
*26:47.300- 26:49.960* :  People who don't normally care about darts at all
*26:49.960- 26:52.220* :  started watching and got behind him
*26:52.220- 26:54.320* :  on his remarkable run to the final.
*26:55.040- 26:57.820* :  Might we be about to see the youngest world champion
*26:57.820- 26:59.160* :  in the sports history?
*27:00.200- 27:00.580* :  Well, no.
*27:00.960- 27:03.440* :  The pre-tournament favourite, another Luke Humphries,
*27:03.440- 27:05.940* :  won the PDC World Final 7-4.
*27:06.340- 27:09.080* :  And since he's the actual winner, we should hear from him.
*27:09.440- 27:09.980* :  Really special.
*27:09.980- 27:11.120* :  I'm really, really pleased.
*27:11.760- 27:14.520* :  But it was the teenager that everyone was talking about.
*27:14.520- 27:15.960* :  And he is very much in demand.
*27:16.360- 27:19.020* :  My colleague Sarah Montague caught up with Luke Littleer
*27:19.200- 27:22.300* :  and his posse of minders as he walked between interviews.
*27:23.180- 27:23.860* :  It's been crazy.
*27:24.660- 27:26.800* :  I knew when all those last night,
*27:26.800- 27:28.740* :  I was going to be speaking to everyone.
*27:28.900- 27:30.760* :  Speaking to everyone who wants to talk to me.
*27:31.280- 27:32.480* :  Well, I wanted to ask you about that,
*27:32.480- 27:33.840* :  because you did lose last night.
*27:33.860- 27:35.260* :  But does it feel like to feed?
*27:35.260- 27:36.440* :  It doesn't look like to feed.
*27:37.020- 27:39.320* :  It's just, I've gained a lot of experience.
*27:39.440- 27:40.580* :  It's gained a bit of money myself.
*27:40.580- 27:43.400* :  And the biggest thing is confidence and the experience.
*27:43.400- 27:46.960* :  So whatever big tournaments are playing next, then,
*27:47.100- 27:48.340* :  I've got that stage experience.
*27:48.480- 27:49.920* :  So how did it feel last night?
*27:49.920- 27:51.080* :  How did it feel this morning?
*27:51.080- 27:51.780* :  What have you been doing?
*27:51.800- 27:52.300* :  Have you slept?
*27:52.720- 27:53.540* :  It slept for two hours.
*27:54.200- 27:56.760* :  But last night, it was just, it was good to be involved
*27:56.780- 27:57.500* :  in a good final.
*27:57.500- 27:58.600* :  Me and Luke played really well.
*27:59.060- 27:59.760* :  What is next?
*28:00.960- 28:02.620* :  Whatever is whatever I can qualify for.
*28:03.060- 28:05.820* :  You've got to qualify for all the Belgium, Germany,
*28:05.820- 28:06.920* :  and Polish tour.
*28:06.920- 28:10.440* :  So as much as I can qualify, that's how much I'll be playing.
*28:11.140- 28:14.060* :  And so for somebody who, because you know the effect you've had,
*28:14.100- 28:15.640* :  you know how many people watched last night,
*28:15.640- 28:18.580* :  more than has ever watched a dance final before.
*28:18.580- 28:20.620* :  You have had a huge effect on the game.
*28:21.340- 28:22.900* :  For somebody who perhaps hasn't played,
*28:23.620- 28:26.520* :  or is just starting, what would you say to them?
*28:26.840- 28:28.940* :  If you like the sport, then practice.
*28:30.240- 28:32.100* :  If you young, try and find an academy,
*28:32.860- 28:35.140* :  get involved, make friends, and just enjoy it.
*28:35.660- 28:38.320* :  And for you, you've got, you're £200,000 richer
*28:38.320- 28:39.120* :  after last night.
*28:39.560- 28:40.340* :  How are you going to use that?
*28:40.340- 28:40.900* :  What are you going to do?
*28:41.180- 28:43.080* :  I've not even four, but I want to go home.
*28:44.040- 28:45.640* :  You've got a lot more interviews to do.
*28:45.640- 28:46.780* :  The world wants you.
*28:46.960- 28:48.280* :  I know. We'll let you get on, Luke.
*28:48.420- 28:49.280* :  Thank you. Thank you.
*28:50.140- 28:53.480* :  Luke Littleer, and congratulations to the winner, Luke Humphries.
*28:55.840- 28:57.320* :  And that's all from us for now,
*28:57.320- 28:59.240* :  but we do enjoy hearing from you.
*28:59.240- 29:00.540* :  So do email us.
*29:00.540- 29:04.040* :  Our address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*29:04.760- 29:06.580* :  This edition was mixed by Annie Smith.
*29:06.580- 29:09.400* :  The producers were Anna Murphy and Harry Bly.
*29:09.840- 29:11.260* :  Our editor is Karen Martin.
*29:11.640- 29:13.660* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and until next time.
*29:14.000- 29:14.260* :  Goodbye.
