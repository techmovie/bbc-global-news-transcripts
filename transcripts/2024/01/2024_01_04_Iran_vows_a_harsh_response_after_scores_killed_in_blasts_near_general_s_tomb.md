*00:16.560- 00:21.120* :  I'm James Reynolds. Today on The Global Story, I'll be looking at the Houthi rebel attacks
*00:21.120- 00:27.400* :  on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Since November, the Iran-backed militia has been attacking vessels
*00:27.400- 00:33.560* :  in this vital shipping route. Why then have the rebels been doing this? And could their attacks
*00:33.560- 00:39.200* :  escalate the wider conflict in the Middle East? The Global Story brings you fresh insights and new

*01:10.480- 01:13.100* :  This is The Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:15.780- 01:20.040* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Thursday the 4th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:20.140- 01:26.260* :  Explosions have killed 95 people in Iran at an event marking four years since a top general,
*01:26.260- 01:31.720* :  Hassan Soleimani was killed by U.S. drone. The leader of the Lebanese armed group,
*01:31.720- 01:37.480* :  Hisbola Hassan Nasrallah, has warned Israel that there will be a decisive response to the assassination
*01:37.480- 01:43.900* :  in Beirut of a deputy leader of Hamas. Russia and Ukraine have agreed their biggest prisoner swap yet,
*01:43.900- 01:50.900* :  involving hundreds of captured soldiers. Also in this podcast, we report from Paris.
*01:52.060- 01:58.480* :  He said, listen, you are a durable, charming young. Would you like to kiss one another again
*01:58.480- 02:04.220* :  in front of my camera? The woman from perhaps the most romantic photo of all time has died.
*02:04.740- 02:05.720* :  We hear her story.
*02:09.180- 02:15.540* :  We begin in the southern Iranian city of Haman. Hundreds of people had gathered on Wednesday for
*02:15.540- 02:21.960* :  a memorial event for a top military commander killed in 2020 by a U.S. drone attack. And then
*02:25.900- 02:31.600* :  there were two explosions in quick succession. Officials say two bags containing explosives
*02:31.600- 02:38.340* :  were detonated remotely at the entrance to a cemetery. As we record this podcast, at least 95
*02:38.340- 02:44.260* :  people are now known to have been killed near the Sahab al-Zaman Mosque. The victims were in a
*02:44.260- 02:50.280* :  procession to the tomb of the Iranian general Hassan Soleimani on the fourth anniversary of his death.
*02:50.900- 02:54.780* :  Pahem Gabbadi from BBC Persian told me more about the blasts.
*02:55.400- 02:59.400* :  This is known to be the deadliest attack that has ever happened in Iran.
*02:59.400- 03:04.700* :  After the explosion, Iranian interior ministers said that the first explosion happened at 3 pm
*03:04.700- 03:09.940* :  local time. After when medics and people rushed to the scene, the second explosion took place
*03:09.940- 03:14.520* :  according to him. Most of the casualties were from the second explosion. This is not the first
*03:14.520- 03:20.680* :  time that people are killed in a ceremony regarding Hassan Soleimani during his funeral. In the
*03:20.680- 03:28.080* :  same city of Kerman, four years ago, 56 people were killed in a stampede crush during the funeral
*03:28.080- 03:32.800* :  ceremony. So it's still unclear that all of these people were killed as a result of the explosion.
*03:33.480- 03:39.480* :  And the fact that this took place at this very sacred moment for many Iranians on the fourth
*03:39.480- 03:44.220* :  anniversary of the death of this general, obviously that's deeply significant as well.
*03:44.800- 03:49.600* :  It is because Iranian authorities consider him as a national hero, but in Iran, Soleimani
*03:49.920- 03:55.100* :  is an extremely controversial figure. Some consider him as a national hero, but many do consider
*03:55.100- 04:00.400* :  him as a war criminal who's behind killing the people across the region. So he's a very
*04:00.400- 04:04.960* :  controversial figure inside Iran. So what are we hearing from Tehran about who may have been
*04:04.960- 04:10.220* :  responsible for the attack? They haven't pointed a finger at any groups yet. We still don't know
*04:10.220- 04:15.080* :  and no groups have yet claimed responsibility for that. But Islamic State has carried out an
*04:15.080- 04:21.140* :  attack in August 2023. Gunmen in Shiraz and Souther in city of Shiraz, one at least was killed
*04:21.600- 04:27.320* :  back in 2018. Again, there was a military parade that Islamic State's admittance
*04:27.320- 04:31.680* :  attacked that place. It was a mass shooting and 25 people at least were killed in that attack.
*04:31.740- 04:36.100* :  No indication as to who have made it. No group has yet claimed responsibility for this.
*04:36.500- 04:42.640* :  That was Pa Ham Gubadi from BBC Persian. The leader of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah,
*04:42.640- 04:48.000* :  Hassan Nasrallah, has warned Israel that there will be a decisive response to the killing of the
*04:48.000- 04:54.280* :  Hamas Deputy Leader Salah al-Aruhri. Hassan Nasrallah described it as a massive and serious crime
*04:54.280- 05:00.460* :  that could not go unpunished. Salah al-Aruhri was killed along with six other people in an
*05:00.460- 05:06.080* :  explosion on Tuesday in Beirut, reported to have been an Israeli drone attack. Israel,
*05:06.080- 05:11.660* :  which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, has strengthened air defenses on its border with
*05:11.660- 05:17.260* :  Lebanon. I spoke to our Beirut correspondent Hugo Basharga and asked him what more did Hassan Nasrallah
*05:17.260- 05:23.380* :  say. He described this killing as a dangerous crime that wouldn't go unpunished. He said
*05:23.380- 05:30.220* :  this was a flagrant Israeli aggression and obviously the killing happened in an area of Beirut
*05:30.220- 05:37.180* :  that is a Hasbola stronghold here in the capital of Lebanon. So a blow to Hamas but also very
*05:37.180- 05:43.180* :  symbolic in terms of where it happened right at the heart of where Hasbola is located. So perhaps
*05:43.180- 05:51.960* :  a message to Hasbola as well. And Hassan Nasrallah also said we're not afraid of war and in a message
*05:51.960- 05:57.920* :  to Israel he said if you are considering a war with us you're going to regret it. A war with
*05:57.920- 06:02.740* :  us will have a heavy cost which is essentially the same message that Israel has been giving Hasbola.
*06:02.740- 06:09.080* :  If there is a war it will be devastating for not only Hasbola but also for Lebanon. And I think
*06:09.080- 06:14.880* :  this is key to understand the position that Hasbola fights itself in because it wants to show that
*06:14.880- 06:21.000* :  it is doing something to support Hamas and Gaza to support the Palestinian population. Again,
*06:21.000- 06:25.100* :  Nasrallah said that those cross-border attacks that have been happening every day are keeping
*06:25.100- 06:31.000* :  Israeli troops busy in the north but at the same time he knows that any kind of miscalculation could
*06:31.000- 06:37.580* :  spark a devastating Israeli response. She goes the BBC has spoken to Dala that's the sister
*06:37.580- 06:46.900* :  of Salah al-Aruhri about the impact that his death is going to have. He will be the trigger not only
*06:46.900- 06:53.120* :  in the West Bank but in the whole world. It will be regional due to the assassination of Sheikh Saleh.
*06:53.520- 06:59.180* :  He is not a normal character. They brought catastrophe upon themselves from all sides.
*07:01.140- 07:08.280* :  You go given the history of conflict in the past between the Lebanon and Israel. How concerned are
*07:08.280- 07:14.260* :  people there about the situation getting out of hand? I think there's no appetite here in this
*07:14.260- 07:21.220* :  country for any kind of military confrontation and I think that's why every time there is an
*07:21.220- 07:27.820* :  incident like there's an attack in the country, lots of people get concerned about the possibility
*07:27.820- 07:33.760* :  of a war. Lebanon is going through a massive economic crisis and lots of people here still remember
*07:33.760- 07:40.200* :  the devastation caused by the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel so they know that any Israeli
*07:40.200- 07:45.200* :  offensive could be catastrophic for Lebanon and I think Hassan as well knows it as well.
*07:45.680- 07:52.220* :  Hugo Bachega in Lebanon. So Hezbollah may have the means to escalate the situation in the region
*07:52.220- 07:57.320* :  militarily but does it have the design? That's the question I put to our security correspondent,
*07:57.320- 08:03.820* :  Frank Gardner. No idea in the good does. I think it suits Hezbollah and their sponsors in Iran
*08:04.560- 08:09.400* :  to keep up just enough pressure on Israel to show that they are supportive of the
*08:09.400- 08:15.180* :  so-called axis of resistance which is Iran's word for its proxies, proxie militias that are
*08:15.180- 08:20.960* :  putting pressure on Israel. So Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, the three-h's but they don't want
*08:20.960- 08:26.560* :  to go to a full-scale war because the 2006 war was devastating, particularly for Lebanon,
*08:26.560- 08:31.640* :  but Israel didn't come out of it particularly well either. Hezbollah has a much more powerful
*08:31.640- 08:37.780* :  missile force than Hamas does, a much more powerful arsenal. It's got an estimated roughly
*08:37.780- 08:43.460* :  150,000 rockets and missiles ranging from short-range ones that would do damage just across the
*08:43.460- 08:47.840* :  border to some really powerful ones that Israel would probably want to take out very quickly
*08:47.840- 08:53.300* :  in a full-scale war, but ones big enough to cause serious damage in Tel Aviv or Haifa.
*08:54.040- 08:57.760* :  And if they launched enough of them at the same time they could probably overwhelm some of Israel's
*08:57.760- 09:04.200* :  defenses. Israel's response would be cataclysmic and Lebanon knows this which is why Lebanese
*09:04.540- 09:10.680* :  politicians have been urging Hezbollah not to respond, not to retaliate, not to provoke another war
*09:10.680- 09:16.800* :  with Israel. So it's not in anybody's interest for that to happen. I think of the four kind of hot
*09:16.800- 09:22.700* :  spots right now in the Middle East that we're seeing. So Beirut, Kerman that you mentioned there,
*09:22.700- 09:28.380* :  these mysterious explosions, Yemen, the southern red sea, and of course Gaza Strait West Bank,
*09:29.080- 09:34.060* :  I think of the four the most likely one to get a bit hotter is probably going to be Yemen
*09:34.060- 09:39.140* :  and the the Houthi attacks on shipping because in the last few minutes there's been a joint
*09:39.140- 09:44.780* :  statement issued by the US and 11 other countries including Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
*09:45.560- 09:50.160* :  and various European countries, basically giving the Houthis the last warning to stop attacking
*09:50.160- 09:55.220* :  shipping or bear in their words, bear the consequences. And by that that means almost certainly,
*09:55.220- 10:00.180* :  although they're not explicit, that means taking out those Houthi missile sites on land,
*10:00.180- 10:05.700* :  and the Houthis are going to have to consider if that's worth it. And again Iran holds the key
*10:05.700- 10:11.360* :  to potentially stopping that. Definitely. I mean Iran doesn't control the Houthis, they are a
*10:11.360- 10:17.920* :  tribal militia that took over Yemen, most of Yemen illegally in September 2014, teamed up with
*10:17.920- 10:23.060* :  the Republican Guard of the ousted president but with Iranian support. Frank Gardner.
*10:23.980- 10:28.960* :  Next to Argentina and the authorities in the country have arrested three people from Syria and
*10:28.960- 10:33.980* :  Lebanon, who were suspected of planning what the government said was a terrorist act on Argentine
*10:33.980- 10:39.740* :  soil. I heard more from our report in Buenos Aires, but on a smink and asked what else the authorities
*10:39.740- 10:44.980* :  were saying. Well they said that they received intelligence information from the US, Israel,
*10:44.980- 10:50.320* :  and Colombia regarding three men who they knew were going to get into the country from different
*10:50.320- 10:56.260* :  airports at different times. And two of the things that security minister Patricia Bullrich
*10:56.260- 11:02.160* :  said worried them was first that the three men were going to stay at a hotel two blocks away
*11:02.160- 11:07.260* :  from the Israeli embassy. And the second is that they were awaiting a package from Yemen.
*11:07.260- 11:12.980* :  They knew was going to weigh around 35 kilos and is actually in the possession now and being
*11:12.980- 11:18.820* :  analyzed by investigators. At Veronica, this comes at a time of increased security anyway because
*11:18.820- 11:24.380* :  of a big sporting event going on there. The Panamerican macabre games, these are sometimes known as
*11:24.380- 11:30.360* :  the Jewish Olympics. This is a regional version. It evolved 4,200 Jewish athletes from 22 countries.
*11:30.980- 11:35.460* :  And so there was heightened alert about this plus you know the tension due to the war in the
*11:35.460- 11:41.200* :  Middle East between Israel and Hamas. But Argentina is always on heightened alert. You know when it comes
*11:41.200- 11:47.980* :  to possible attacks because 30 years ago itself are not one but two massive attacks against
*11:47.980- 11:55.980* :  Jewish objectives. Now those two bombings cost over a hundred lives at the time and yet still
*11:55.980- 12:02.360* :  there are tensions. There's a very large Jewish population in Argentina and a large population
*12:02.360- 12:06.760* :  from the Middle East as well. Yes, that's right. I wouldn't say there is actual tension on the ground.
*12:06.760- 12:11.940* :  Communities here are Argentina is you know formed up people from many different communities
*12:11.940- 12:17.700* :  and in generally speaking they get along very well. But of course you know with this history that
*12:17.700- 12:21.880* :  happened in 1992 when the Israeli embassy was bombed and two years later when the Jewish
*12:21.880- 12:28.220* :  community center Amia was bombed. The security services are always very very vigilant about you
*12:28.220- 12:33.920* :  know relations between especially as you say the communities from the Muslim Arab countries and
*12:33.920- 12:40.200* :  the Jewish community. I was Veronica Smink in Argentina. Now to the extraordinary story of one man.
*12:40.200- 12:45.760* :  Last month in the US state of Oklahoma a judge declared Glyn Simmons an innocent man.
*12:45.760- 12:52.180* :  After he spent 48 years five months and 13 days in prison for a murder he did not commit.
*12:52.760- 12:57.900* :  He served the longest wrongful incarceration of anybody exonerated in the United States.
*12:58.780- 13:03.980* :  Glyn Simmons was sentenced to the death penalty and that was commuted to a life sentence.
*13:03.980- 13:09.380* :  When he did make it out of prison in July of last year he was left destitute and also had been
*13:09.380- 13:16.600* :  diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Nulam Agavan spoke to Glyn about what it meant to him to be exonerated.
*13:17.020- 13:21.200* :  He wanted to clarify he was more than exonerated. He's innocent. So what's the difference?
*13:22.140- 13:26.900* :  Well to me exonerated is like we can't find your guilt to be we're going to let you slide.
*13:27.380- 13:31.760* :  Actually innocence is mean I didn't do it. You're not letting me slide. I actually didn't do it.
*13:32.040- 13:38.720* :  But this comes after nearly 50 years and I'm wondering how you get your head around that.
*13:38.720- 13:44.940* :  I think it's very difficult to imagine that much of your life that was in prison.
*13:45.660- 13:49.080* :  Yeah I'm still working on it and I guess I'll be working on it for the rest of my life.
*13:49.080- 13:52.880* :  You know get my head around it takes it all you know one day at a time very thankful,
*13:52.880- 13:58.460* :  very grateful you know. I'm going to go back to 1975. A jury convicted you and another man
*13:58.460- 14:06.140* :  of a murder that took place in a liquor store in Oklahoma that previous year you weren't in the
*14:06.160- 14:12.260* :  state at the time. What did you think when you were convicted? I think it was actually your
*14:12.260- 14:17.920* :  sentence to the death penalty to begin with even life imprisonment. Did you think it would be
*14:17.920- 14:23.900* :  rectified? Did you realize what was ahead of you? I didn't do the crime being innocent.
*14:24.580- 14:28.860* :  I've always believed that I would be released even when I was sentenced to the death penalty
*14:29.660- 14:33.560* :  that it helps you to keep your faith maintain your faith and you know revive your faith once
*14:33.560- 14:39.080* :  it's not down and stuff like that. And so that's it because we're talking about going over decades
*14:39.080- 14:45.880* :  Glenn and you didn't lose your faith in the system. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll be right.
*14:47.160- 14:51.300* :  I will be lying if I say I didn't lose my faith. You know I lost hope, lost faith a bunch of
*14:51.300- 14:57.080* :  times. Lost my mind a couple of times you know. But it's like a rubber band. You're expanding
*14:57.080- 15:02.440* :  your return. You know back to where it was. I didn't see you guys go total crazy. Never
*15:02.440- 15:07.180* :  revive. Never come back. You know because of the pressure and stuff. You know I think it was my
*15:07.180- 15:12.940* :  innocence that had maintained it kept me bouncing back kept me fighting. You were cleared. There are
*15:12.940- 15:18.020* :  lots of legal details. There was problems with evidence in the original trial. The state of
*15:18.020- 15:23.580* :  Oklahoma did not elect to retry the case. But as you've talked about you were adamant not only for
*15:23.580- 15:30.320* :  an exoneration but also to be recognized as an innocent man. Now that that has happened and
*15:30.480- 15:36.200* :  you've been outside. What was that like to leave the prison? I believe it was in July that you were
*15:36.200- 15:41.820* :  out on bond. I believe in the manifestation of what the massage was talking about when you say it
*15:42.340- 15:47.420* :  why more of the things I do when you can do it greatly. You know I kind of found out how to
*15:47.420- 15:53.800* :  decipher that with the process was and it worked. But one day I was in cell 112 and the next day
*15:53.800- 16:00.200* :  I was sitting in Pearl's restaurant in the Poor Boy sandwich. It was overwhelming. Also I believe
*16:00.200- 16:07.500* :  when you left prison somebody had to bring you clothes, money, nothing.
*16:08.780- 16:13.300* :  Four to eight years, five months and thirteen days of incarceration. Just like that I was
*16:13.300- 16:17.980* :  free the next day. Didn't have a thing. You know I had some relatives with broadband calls and
*16:17.980- 16:23.660* :  stuff. Didn't have nothing to wear. Because you're meant to and people might be shocked by this.
*16:24.080- 16:30.580* :  Your others will understate law to a maximum of 175,000 dollars. That would be three thousand
*16:30.580- 16:34.820* :  dollars a year. And that is different to other states in the United States. This is Oklahoma
*16:34.820- 16:39.500* :  we're talking about. But you haven't seen that money. I'm not at all. They wouldn't even give it
*16:39.500- 16:44.500* :  a hundred to seventy five if only exoneration had to be declared acts of innocence and all
*16:44.500- 16:48.980* :  to get that. Still haven't got to still contested it you know. And I bring this up for the very
*16:48.980- 16:55.780* :  practical reasons about how you're going to live week to week, month to month. But also I've
*16:56.440- 17:02.680* :  been relying on the generous donations of supporters and families and friends and strangers and
*17:02.680- 17:09.980* :  strangers exactly because I was looking I know you have a fundraising page and a lot of the people
*17:10.020- 17:16.540* :  that have donated they're anonymous. Even sometimes people to the tune of thirty thousand dollars
*17:17.480- 17:21.920* :  anonymous. Yeah. What do you think when you see it? I believe in the goodness of people.
*17:22.280- 17:26.520* :  I don't want this opportunity to say thank you to express my gratitude to whoever this is
*17:26.520- 17:30.800* :  the November's Donald was. And if they're listening you know I want to tell them now thank you
*17:30.800- 17:35.400* :  from the bottom of my heart. I really appreciate it. Really needed it. That was Glenn Simmons.
*17:38.020- 17:46.220* :  Still to come we meet the microdosis. It helps me get into this calm state of flow. So if you could
*17:46.220- 17:53.460* :  do five hours worth of work in one hour that's huge. So can illegal hallucinogens really do them?

*18:33.720- 18:38.260* :  I'm James Reynolds. Today on The Global Story I'll be looking at the Hoothy Rebel attacks
*18:38.260- 18:44.140* :  on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Since November the Iran-backed militia has been attacking
*18:44.140- 18:50.340* :  vessels in this vital shipping route. Why then have the rebels been doing this? And could their
*18:50.340- 18:55.860* :  attacks escalate the wider conflict in the Middle East? The Global Story brings you fresh insights

*19:09.180- 19:15.100* :  Welcome back to The Global News Podcast. The Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says a sea
*19:15.100- 19:20.880* :  corridor has been opened to ship relief supplies to the area hit by an earthquake on Monday.
*19:21.360- 19:25.540* :  Mr Kishida said it was a battle against time to help people affected by the quake
*19:25.820- 19:31.660* :  on the Notho Peninsula in central Japan. At least 73 people are now known to have died.
*19:31.660- 19:35.720* :  Rescue teams struggling with heavy rain aftershocks and blocked roads.
*19:36.440- 19:41.020* :  Our correspondent Jean McKenzie has been travelling towards the epicenter and centres this report
*19:41.020- 19:45.000* :  from the city of Wajima which has the highest confirmed death toll so far.
*19:48.300- 19:53.940* :  We've been travelling for two days now to try and reach the epicenter and the towns we know
*19:53.940- 19:58.160* :  have been really badly hit where we think people are still trapped under the rubble.
*19:58.880- 20:04.860* :  But I've lost count of how many times we've been forced to turn back because the roads have been
*20:04.860- 20:11.260* :  totally severed. There are huge cracks we just can't cross and these are the same delays the rescue
*20:11.260- 20:17.360* :  teams are facing so they are losing precious time to save people. We have now arrived in Wajima
*20:17.700- 20:23.940* :  which is the worst affected town that we know of at least two dozen people have died here
*20:24.620- 20:29.320* :  and the destruction is far greater than anything we've seen along the way.
*20:29.320- 20:37.960* :  I'm at the site of the town's marketplace which has completely burnt to the ground.
*20:38.660- 20:44.340* :  A fire broke out here during the earthquake and the marketplace was filled with old wooden
*20:44.340- 20:51.140* :  stalls that immediately caught a light and the flames spread. An area the size of around two
*20:51.140- 20:59.420* :  football pitches has been entirely reduced to ash. People are returning here to look for their
*20:59.420- 21:05.900* :  relatives who they think might still be trapped under the rubble. A resident comes to tell the rescuers
*21:05.900- 21:12.060* :  she thinks her husband's aunt is inside. She's 95 and he can move much. We've looked in all the
*21:12.060- 21:18.520* :  evacuation centre but can find her. We're following a rescue team with search dogs but they only arrived
*21:18.520- 21:25.600* :  here this morning. There has been a huge delay in searching for survivors. They are now going to each
*21:25.640- 21:32.560* :  of the collapsed small wooden homes in the town to search them one by one. They told us that their
*21:32.600- 21:37.040* :  searches aren't based on any information so this is an incredibly slow process.
*21:39.460- 21:44.180* :  In another part of town cars have been crushed by buildings and their alarms
*21:44.180- 21:52.180* :  glare continuously. The peak of the destruction here is a seven-story concrete building that's
*21:52.180- 21:58.300* :  now lying on its side with its contents spewed and splintered on the floor. Fireteams have been
*21:58.300- 22:04.180* :  searching the building since this morning. There is a woman inside we're told but they don't know
*22:04.180- 22:09.300* :  if she's dead or alive so they are calling out to her but she hasn't responded.
*22:11.140- 22:18.040* :  That report was by Jean McKenzie in Japan. Russia and Ukraine have agreed to exchange hundreds
*22:18.040- 22:24.220* :  of prisoners of war after what Moscow described as complex negotiations. From Kiev here's James
*22:24.220- 22:30.120* :  Waterhouse. It's the first time since August that an exchange has been agreed with Moscow previously
*22:30.120- 22:36.240* :  being accused of trying to weaponize its prisoners of war. Are people our home posted President
*22:36.240- 22:41.640* :  Zelensky? Some of his returning Ukrainian soldiers were captured while defending the Chernobyl nuclear
*22:41.640- 22:47.580* :  power plant, Snake Island in the Black Sea and the southern city of Mattyupol in the early stages
*22:47.580- 22:53.140* :  of the full-scale invasion. The involvement of the United Arab Emirates follows a rare visit there
*22:53.200- 22:59.700* :  by Vladimir Putin a month ago. It's still a rare area of cooperation between Ukraine and Russia.
*23:00.360- 23:04.860* :  James Waterhouse in Ukraine there. The former president of Sierra Leone,
*23:04.860- 23:10.980* :  Ernest Baikoroma, has been charged with four counts of treason over an alleged coup plot in November.
*23:11.440- 23:15.100* :  On Tuesday, a member of Mr. Karoma's security team was also charged with treason
*23:15.480- 23:20.100* :  by the court in Freetown alongside 11 other suspects. Tomas Naadi reports.
*23:20.900- 23:25.860* :  Ex-president Ernest Baikoroma had already been invited for questioning following the alleged
*23:25.860- 23:31.240* :  coup attempt. Echo was sent a delegation led by President of Ghana and Senegal to Freetown
*23:31.580- 23:36.840* :  to assess the security situation in the country. In a leaked letter, the original body offered to
*23:36.840- 23:42.080* :  whose president Karoma Temprary in Abuja, while an agent president built of Sierra Leone to drop
*23:42.080- 23:47.800* :  all charges against him. In November last year, armed men broke into an armory and prisons
*23:48.260- 23:54.180* :  freeing over 2,000 inmates. The attacks also resulted in the deaths of more than 20 people.
*23:55.060- 23:59.780* :  That was Tomas Naadi. Now, could psychedelic drugs be the key to unlocking
*23:59.780- 24:06.380* :  workplace productivity? Well, there are some people who think so. The concept is known as micro-dosing.
*24:06.480- 24:12.400* :  It's when you take a tiny amount of LSD or so-called magic mushrooms as part of your ordinary
*24:12.400- 24:17.400* :  day to help you work better. Now, of course, these drugs are illegal in most parts of the world
*24:17.520- 24:21.800* :  and there's insufficient medical evidence about what the long-term harm could be.
*24:22.520- 24:26.060* :  North America Correspondent Nisha Flurry has been meeting some of the people involved.
*24:31.060- 24:37.500* :  In the 60s, psychedelic drugs such as LSD or magic mushrooms were associated with long mind-bending
*24:37.500- 24:45.480* :  trips, hallucinations, and hippies. Exploration, transformation. Today in America, some are
*24:45.480- 24:51.200* :  taking such schedule-one drugs in tiny doses in an attempt to improve focus, productivity,
*24:51.240- 24:58.480* :  and creativity. This is called micro-dosing. I would sometimes take it a few days in a row and then
*24:58.480- 25:04.620* :  kind of not do it a few days in a row. Curiosity, wonder. Donald, whose name I've changed,
*25:04.620- 25:11.820* :  micro-doses on a regular basis. He says it helps him work. It helps me get into this calm
*25:12.640- 25:19.920* :  state of flow, right? So if you could do five hours worth of work in one hour, that's huge.
*25:20.100- 25:26.620* :  And not only are you doing that work, but you're more curious, you're more engaged. Sometimes there's
*25:26.620- 25:31.480* :  like maybe a problem I want to solve or something I want to learn about and this kind of gives me a
*25:31.480- 25:38.520* :  way to think outside the box a little bit. hallucinogenic drug use has increased among those aged 26
*25:38.520- 25:45.920* :  and older, with over 5.5 million people using psychedelics in 2019. As attitudes change
*25:45.920- 25:52.080* :  and more people, micro-dose in the workplace, some employers are embracing it too. You're taking
*25:52.080- 26:00.560* :  a stance that was polarizing at times. Shane Heath is the founder and CEO of coffee alternative
*26:00.560- 26:06.260* :  mud water. Not only does he support employees who want to micro-dose at work, mud water
*26:06.260- 26:10.160* :  donate support of its profits to psychedelic research and education.
*26:10.760- 26:15.480* :  No, somebody chooses micro-dosing as something that's helpful for them. They're free to do that.
*26:15.960- 26:21.040* :  We don't have a policy that encourages or supports use of psychedelics, but we don't have a policy
*26:21.040- 26:25.300* :  that polices it either, right? From my personal experience, the things that I've went through and
*26:25.440- 26:31.780* :  the experiences that I've had with these substances, it was just a personal choice to be an advocate.
*26:32.580- 26:36.840* :  There isn't enough evidence yet to say if micro-dosing is beneficial in the workplace
*26:36.840- 26:42.480* :  or even safe, and the drugs being used are illegal at the federal level. Still,
*26:42.540- 26:47.640* :  that hasn't stopped business leaders from indulging. Micro-dosing in the workplace, it sounds like
*26:47.640- 26:52.520* :  you think it has a role to play. Delip and Sivir coaches start up founders.
*26:52.820- 26:58.900* :  One hundred percent, yeah. Most clients, I would say in this day and age, are not concerned around
*26:58.900- 27:06.340* :  the legal pieces, although they do respect the laws. That's a sea change from say five plus years
*27:06.340- 27:10.780* :  ago, right? I think there's a lot of advancement right now around the research, and then we're
*27:10.780- 27:15.100* :  starting to see the regulation change at different levels, local, state and national over time.
*27:16.200- 27:21.360* :  There are risks. The unsupervised use of recreational drugs could be psychologically damaging
*27:21.360- 27:26.780* :  to those with certain mental conditions. But with renewed interest in psychedelics,
*27:27.160- 27:30.300* :  advocates hope it will help gain mainstream acceptance.
*27:32.860- 27:37.240* :  The woman who appeared in one of the most famous romantic photographs of all time,
*27:37.240- 27:41.660* :  the kiss by the hotel de Ville in Paris, has died at the age of 93.
*27:42.240- 27:47.680* :  François-Bornet was one half of the young couples in embracing on the street in a black and white
*27:47.680- 27:53.880* :  photo from 1950, taken by the photographer Robert Doinel. The photograph became a huge commercial
*27:53.880- 27:59.800* :  success in the 1980s, sparking a legal route about copyright, Huescofield reports from Paris.
*28:00.600- 28:05.040* :  Everyone assumed that the world famous photograph of a passionate young couple kissing each
*28:05.040- 28:09.600* :  other on the mouth, as they walked down the street in central Paris, must have been spontaneous.
*28:10.060- 28:14.800* :  Beautifully framed against a backdrop of the hotel de Ville, it was a superlative shot,
*28:15.080- 28:20.160* :  capturing perfectly the permanent romance of the city, even in those drab-boost-war years.
*28:20.860- 28:25.800* :  In fact, the photo was staged. So much was apparent after the picture became a massive
*28:25.800- 28:31.960* :  commercial hit in the 80s, appearing on posters that adorned young people's bedrooms the world over.
*28:32.380- 28:36.640* :  Such was the fame of the picture that more than one couple, now in their 50s,
*28:36.740- 28:40.540* :  came forward claiming to be the ones in the shot, and claiming also some
*28:40.540- 28:46.700* :  recompense for the use of their image. That prompted François-Bornet to herself step forward
*28:46.700- 28:52.740* :  and set the story straight. She and her boyfriend, both drama students, had been approached by
*28:52.740- 28:57.580* :  Robert Wano after he saw them kissing. He said he loved it and could they do it again.
*28:57.860- 29:02.100* :  François-Bornet recounted the story many times. Here she is in 2005.
*29:03.420- 29:09.820* :  He said, listen, you are adorable, charming young. Would you like to kiss one another again
*29:09.820- 29:16.140* :  in front of my camera? Of course we said yes right away. So three or four days later we went to
*29:16.140- 29:22.360* :  the town hall and Wano told us to do what we wanted to kiss one another without taking care of
*29:22.360- 29:28.580* :  the camera. He said, be natural as you are in the normal life. We didn't need any persuasion
*29:28.580- 29:33.520* :  and we kissed one another and that is how this photograph became as famous.
*29:33.520- 29:39.540* :  To prove that her story was true, she produced an original copy of the photo signed by Duano himself.
*29:39.540- 29:44.620* :  He'd been taking pictures to illustrate an article in Life magazine about love in Paris.
*29:45.180- 29:49.660* :  The shot languished in the archives until it was spotted by a sharp-eyed commercial agent
*29:49.660- 29:54.740* :  in the early 80s. François-Bornet went on to have a career in film and lived a long life.
*29:55.280- 30:01.200* :  And the boyfriend? Well it didn't last. For all the passion of the kiss, they split up a short
*30:01.200- 30:08.540* :  time later. Hughes co-filled in France. And that's all from us for now but there will be a new
*30:08.540- 30:12.940* :  addition of the global news podcast later on. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics

*30:37.360- 30:44.240* :  I'm James Reynolds. Today on The Global Story, I'll be looking at the
*30:44.240- 30:50.240* :  Houthi rebel attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Since November, the Iran-backed militia
*30:50.340- 30:56.080* :  has been attacking vessels in this vital shipping route. Why then have the rebels been doing this?
*30:56.700- 31:00.160* :  And could their attacks escalate the wider conflict in the Middle East?
