*01:33.520- 01:39.800* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Sunday, the 14th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:40.320- 01:45.780* :  The pro-democracy and sovereignty candidate William Lai wins Taiwan's presidential elections.
*01:46.220- 01:53.160* :  Over the last eight years, we have tried continuously to extend goodwill. We hope in the future,
*01:53.160- 01:56.640* :  China will realize peace serves the interests of both sides.
*01:56.640- 02:01.660* :  UN officials call for calm after two days of US-led air strikes against the
*02:01.660- 02:05.720* :  Houthi movement in Yemen and is Ecuador and Narcos State.
*02:05.720- 02:10.240* :  We are fighting every day so it doesn't become an narcos State. I do believe that we could win
*02:10.240- 02:16.560* :  and I will never stop fighting until we win. We have an exclusive BBC interview with the
*02:16.560- 02:21.660* :  President of Ecuador which has seen a recent explosion in gang-related violence.
*02:24.320- 02:30.600* :  Also in this podcast, Russia declares the exiled best-selling fiction writer Boris Akunin
*02:30.600- 02:38.600* :  a foreign agent and prosecutors in Peru on the reported discovery of alien mummies in a cardboard box.
*02:38.800- 02:45.220* :  These are handmade with synthetic glue, unless extraterrestrials have brought their glue
*02:45.220- 02:47.780* :  from another planet, which I don't think happened.
*02:51.160- 02:56.420* :  The people of Taiwan, which China claims as its own, have defied warnings from Beijing by
*02:56.420- 03:02.140* :  electing a candidate who was vowed to maintain the island's democracy. William Lai is from the
*03:02.140- 03:07.880* :  Democratic Progressive Party, which secured a third consecutive term in office. China insists
*03:07.880- 03:13.540* :  the island will be re-unified and hasn't ruled out using force to do so. Our correspondent
*03:13.540- 03:19.040* :  Rupert Wingfield Hayes is in the capital Taipei and sent this report on the day's events.
*03:23.660- 03:29.460* :  A huge crowd in central Taipei welcomes the man who will be Taiwan's next president.
*03:30.280- 03:35.200* :  William Lai is a former political fire brand, but these days speak softly.
*03:35.740- 03:41.640* :  That has done nothing to assuage China, which considers Mr. Lai a troublemaker.
*03:42.060- 03:46.320* :  It told Taiwan's voters that choosing him would take the island closer to war,
*03:46.500- 03:52.400* :  but the threats and intimidation didn't work. His supporters say if anything, it had the opposite effect.
*03:59.580- 04:04.600* :  He says Taiwan's future will be determined by its own people and that Chinese leader Xi Jinping
*04:04.600- 04:10.740* :  should learn to be quiet during Taiwan elections. Nevertheless, at his post-election press conference,
*04:10.740- 04:18.680* :  President Lai was quick to offer Beijing an olive branch. Over the last eight years,
*04:18.680- 04:24.800* :  we have tried continuously to extend good will. Unfortunately, China has not responded to these
*04:24.800- 04:30.480* :  gestures. We hope in the future, China will realise peace serves the interests of both sides.
*04:32.140- 04:37.800* :  At their campaign headquarters, Taiwan's main opposition party, the KMT, the whole party leadership
*04:37.800- 04:45.560* :  bowed to their supporters and asked for their forgiveness. The KMT had run on a platform of
*04:45.560- 04:52.380* :  getting closer to China. Beijing's preference for the KMT may actually have contributed to its
*04:52.380- 04:57.140* :  defeat. Many Taiwanese view it as far too friendly to China's communist rulers.
*05:00.060- 05:04.800* :  Instead, they gave the party China hate and historic third presidential win.
*05:05.720- 05:09.600* :  Now everyone is waiting to see how Xi Jinping will respond.
*05:09.740- 05:16.680* :  Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Taipei. So what does this election result tell us and how indeed will China
*05:16.680- 05:20.800* :  respond? Questions for our correspondent in Taipei, Shai Mahalil?
*05:21.300- 05:27.940* :  I think it tells us that Taiwan is still going to go with the self-governing stance,
*05:28.020- 05:33.780* :  which is to take Taiwan away from China's orbit, closer to the United States,
*05:33.780- 05:38.280* :  closer to other allies, and this is something that has continued to anger Beijing.
*05:38.300- 05:45.240* :  Remember Beijing calls William Lai the troublemaker, but also I think he himself was very robust
*05:45.240- 05:51.160* :  when talking about China and his victory speech and answering questions in his first press conference
*05:51.160- 05:57.140* :  saying that he will ensure the safeguarding of Taiwan against any aggression or intimidation
*05:57.140- 06:01.640* :  from China. I don't think we're going to see any easing of tensions between China and Taiwan
*06:01.640- 06:08.120* :  anytime soon. So strong words from China, but will there be anything more than strong words because
*06:08.120- 06:13.620* :  the worry of course is military action. The worry is military action and remember that in 2022
*06:13.620- 06:21.080* :  after Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, China flew aircraft and it crossed the dividing line
*06:21.080- 06:25.760* :  in the Taiwan straight when that was very worrying. And since then, you know, there has been
*06:25.760- 06:32.140* :  aircraft carriers, for example, going very close to Taiwanese waters, anything that happens between
*06:32.140- 06:38.280* :  China and Taiwan also affects Japan and the whole region. What's interesting, I think, Alex,
*06:38.300- 06:43.200* :  is that when I spoke to voters, they were saying they were worried about the economy. They were
*06:43.200- 06:47.180* :  worried about housing, especially young first-time voters. They're worried about employment,
*06:47.180- 06:52.980* :  and they want to see the government deliver on these issues. But at the back of everyone's mind,
*06:52.980- 06:58.240* :  I think, is that possible aggression from Beijing? And as one voter put it to me, she said,
*06:58.240- 07:02.620* :  look, yes, of course it's worrying, but remember, we've been living in the shadow of those threats
*07:02.660- 07:08.120* :  for years. So yes, but there are other urgent matters on our mind when it comes today today.
*07:28.820- 07:34.800* :  But those calls seem to be falling on deaf ears with fresh attacks on one Yemeni port being
*07:34.800- 07:40.860* :  reported on Saturday. Prior to that, the US military said it had hit a radar site used by the
*07:40.860- 07:45.880* :  Iranian-backed Houthis who control much of Yemen and have been attacking international shipping
*07:45.880- 07:49.920* :  in the Red Sea. The Houthis have continued to show their defiance.
*07:56.100- 08:01.800* :  Their leaders, they're watching as a drone dropped a bomb with precision onto a US flag and
*08:01.800- 08:08.120* :  rockets flared into the desert sky. Our correspondent in Beirut Hugo Bashege is closely monitoring
*08:08.120- 08:14.200* :  events in Yemen and the Red Sea. People who know the Houthis say that these attacks are unlikely
*08:14.200- 08:19.380* :  to stop them. So far, they haven't done anything. They fired a missile yesterday that didn't
*08:19.380- 08:24.060* :  hit anything. And the expectation is that they're going to respond probably by carrying out
*08:24.480- 08:30.480* :  more attacks. And I think perhaps as an indication of that, the US Navy has alerted American flag
*08:30.480- 08:35.520* :  vessels to stay away from the coast of Yemen in the next few days. So it's very likely that things
*08:35.520- 08:41.120* :  are going to remain very tense in the Red Sea. Is there any indication that anyone involved is
*08:41.120- 08:46.540* :  willing to listen to those calls to avoid doing anything that might make this already precarious
*08:46.540- 08:51.060* :  situation even more dangerous? Well, the Houthis have been saying that the attacks they've been
*08:51.060- 08:58.360* :  carrying out are in response to Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. And the Americans in the
*08:58.360- 09:05.780* :  British are saying the strikes are about guaranteeing freedom of navigation. They say that it
*09:05.780- 09:11.320* :  doesn't have anything to do with this situation in Gaza. Obviously, all these events are connected.
*09:11.800- 09:17.460* :  President Biden has been saying that they were trying really hard to prevent an escalation
*09:17.460- 09:23.020* :  of the conflict. And now, American missiles are hitting positions in Yemen. Nobody knows what's
*09:23.020- 09:27.660* :  going to happen, how the Houthis are going to respond. But President Biden today said the US
*09:27.660- 09:33.900* :  had sent a private message to Iran who support the Houthis. He didn't give details, but he said,
*09:33.900- 09:40.300* :  I think we are well prepared. Hugo Bachega in Beirut. Lieutenant Colonel Retard Adam
*09:40.300- 09:48.440* :  Clements was the US Army attaché to Yemen between 2017 and 2018. Rebecca Kesby asked him about
*09:48.440- 09:54.480* :  President Biden's latest comments saying the US had delivered a private message to Tehran,
*09:54.720- 10:00.460* :  who could have helped America to deliver that message. And why is Joe Biden telling us?
*10:00.820- 10:06.620* :  This is some public signaling to many different factions stating that the United States is talking
*10:06.620- 10:12.280* :  with Iran, signaling also to other leadership in the region. The United States is directly talking
*10:12.280- 10:17.700* :  with Iran about this matter, at least specifically in the Red Sea. And the past Oman has definitely been
*10:17.700- 10:22.440* :  a very important communication link between the United States and the Houthi movement as well as
*10:22.460- 10:28.340* :  to Iran. And then also within the past year, very important data on to a rapprochement publicly
*10:28.340- 10:34.620* :  with Iran and Saudis renewing some of their open or released public communication could have been
*10:34.620- 10:41.200* :  through multiple methods. And what do you make of these strikes led by the US? Were they a good idea
*10:41.200- 10:47.860* :  or is there a danger that the US is actually being played by the Houthis and their associates to
*10:47.860- 10:52.840* :  draw them into a wider conflict? I personally am pessimistic about their effects. This I think
*10:52.840- 10:57.980* :  could have a limited long term effect on Houthi ability to strike ships in the Red Sea. It's
*10:57.980- 11:03.460* :  very important to know that the Houthis have wasted years and years of an air campaign that the
*11:03.460- 11:09.420* :  satellite coalition led since 2015, 26 time frame. And the Houthis have actually been a state of war
*11:09.420- 11:15.320* :  well before this. They're very adroit at protecting a lot of these different assets that they've
*11:15.320- 11:21.840* :  had. And over the course of time, especially the past 10 years, I do however think that the maritime
*11:21.840- 11:27.440* :  coalition that the US Secretary of Defense Austin announced was forming in the latter part of December.
*11:27.440- 11:32.720* :  That is the better use of military resources. We don't want to escalate the conflicts in the
*11:32.720- 11:38.180* :  Middle East when we have more fighting back and forth or possible escalation on the Lebanese border
*11:38.200- 11:43.780* :  with Israel. We all know what's happening in Gaza. We also have to remember that there are US and
*11:43.780- 11:48.660* :  other coalition forces operating in Syria and Iraq. You have to look at resources that the US and
*11:48.660- 11:53.440* :  others are trying to use the support Ukraine against Russia. So it's hard to make this pie bigger
*11:53.440- 11:58.660* :  with resources. And that's what I feel is just not worth it right now. It's definitely not a perfect
*11:58.660- 12:06.040* :  solution. Lieutenant Colonel retired Adam Clements speaking to Rebecca Kesby. As the world's
*12:06.040- 12:11.320* :  attention focuses on events in the Red Sea, Israeli forces have kept up their bombardment of Gaza.
*12:11.760- 12:16.480* :  There's also been further violence in the occupied West Bank. We'll hear more about that shortly.
*12:16.480- 12:23.060* :  But first, ask our correspondent in Jerusalem Reda Al-Mawi. If people in Gaza were at all
*12:23.060- 12:28.560* :  able to follow events off the coast of Yemen. They are indeed. Of course, communications are very
*12:28.560- 12:34.520* :  difficult inside Gaza because of their lack of electricity. But they are updated of what's
*12:34.520- 12:40.100* :  happening in the world through local journalists who've been reporting on the conflict for almost
*12:40.100- 12:45.800* :  a hundred days now. And they recorded many messages from the people of Gaza saying thank you to
*12:45.800- 12:50.640* :  the Houthis because they see this as the sign of solidarity with them. And many of these
*12:50.640- 12:56.240* :  videos are actually now on YouTube. And they say we wish that many other Arabs would have stood
*12:56.240- 13:03.440* :  with us like the Yemenis did. Still no let up though in the Israeli attacks on Gaza. And still it
*13:03.440- 13:08.680* :  seems to be the women and the children who are bearing the brunt. Yes, an overnight Israeli army
*13:08.680- 13:14.380* :  attack on a house in Rafa in the south of Gaza killed 10 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian
*13:14.380- 13:21.560* :  health ministry in Gaza. They said that in 24 hours 135 Palestinians have been killed. And
*13:21.560- 13:26.900* :  reports from the Nasr hospital in south of Gaza said that a two-year-old girl is among those
*13:26.960- 13:32.040* :  who have been killed. This brings the total number of victims to date since the beginning of the
*13:32.040- 13:40.960* :  conflict to 23,843 Palestinians. And 70 percent of them are women and children according to
*13:40.960- 13:46.000* :  medical sources there. And I understand some rockets reported going in the other direction too.
*13:46.520- 13:52.200* :  Yes, Israeli radio said yesterday that rockets aimed at Ash Dodd in the south of Israel came from
*13:52.200- 13:57.800* :  northern Gaza, which is an area in which Israel is saying the Hamas military infrastructure has been
*13:57.800- 14:03.400* :  completely destroyed. Meantime there's yet more violence in the occupied West Bank. Yes, on Friday
*14:03.460- 14:08.380* :  the Israeli army announced the killing of three Palestinians. It claimed they attempted to
*14:08.380- 14:14.580* :  infiltrate a settlement west of Hebron in the West Bank. The Palestinian authorities said later
*14:14.580- 14:21.580* :  that there were teenagers from a nearby village, aged between 16 and 19. And Israeli press is saying
*14:21.580- 14:26.920* :  security chiefs in Israel warned Benjamin Netanyahu that the West Bank might actually witness
*14:26.920- 14:33.300* :  the third uprising, like the one that was in Israel and the occupied territories in the early 2000.
*14:33.400- 14:37.920* :  And they added that Islamic Jihad and the Hamas are working together in the West Bank,
*14:37.920- 14:40.860* :  which poses a bigger threat to the security of Israel.
*14:41.100- 14:47.920* :  Redder Armoury in Jerusalem. Football now and the opening game of the Africa Cup of Nations
*14:47.920- 14:54.660* :  2024 has taken place on the outskirts of Abu Jain between the hosts Ivory Coast and Guinea-Besau.
*14:54.820- 15:01.720* :  The contest is a model of competitiveness and unpredictability since Egypt won three in a row
*15:01.720- 15:07.240* :  between 2006 and 2010. There have been six tournaments and six different winners.
*15:07.240- 15:13.680* :  Our sports news correspondent Alex Kapstik is in Abu Jain and watch the game. So did the men
*15:13.720- 15:18.980* :  of Ivory Coast get off to a flying start? They did and they secured a tunnel victory in the end,
*15:18.980- 15:23.280* :  but it wasn't a particularly impressive performance from Ivory Coast. As you say, it was a very quick
*15:23.280- 15:27.920* :  start. Thank you for final capitalizing on a mistake in the Guinea-Besau defense, but a very
*15:27.920- 15:32.220* :  good finish for him, given the goalkeeper no chance. That was on four minutes. Guinea-Besau did
*15:32.220- 15:37.960* :  have a few chances themselves, which they spurned. And then Jolent Philippe crashed on 50-half minutes,
*15:37.960- 15:43.480* :  got the ball inside the penalty area, juggled it around and then squeezed the ball in under pressure.
*15:43.540- 15:48.140* :  And that was it really. The crowd were getting a little bit impatient with their team. Not a full
*15:48.140- 15:53.580* :  house here at 60,000 capacity. The official attendance only 38,000, which is a bit of a surprise,
*15:53.580- 15:59.480* :  given the the fevered anticipation of this city and this country ahead of this opening match
*15:59.480- 16:03.580* :  of the Africa Cup of Nations. Yeah, you talk about that fevered excitement. Is the excitement that
*16:03.580- 16:09.060* :  Afcon always generates going to be justified this time? Certainly the atmosphere in Abu Jain,
*16:09.060- 16:14.880* :  where this match took places on the outskirts of the country's economic capital. It was fantastic.
*16:14.880- 16:20.420* :  Everybody dressed up in the country's colors, the green, white and orange of Ivory Coast.
*16:20.740- 16:24.240* :  Every time you spoke to someone, the first of all, they would welcome you to their country.
*16:24.240- 16:27.360* :  And then they would want to talk about the Africa Cup of Nations. They're really proud
*16:27.360- 16:32.600* :  that they've been able to put on this tournament. They've built six stadiums, four of them.
*16:32.600- 16:37.960* :  Two of them have been refurbished. They've built roads, new hotels, updated their hospitals.
*16:38.580- 16:42.940* :  Over a billion dollars has been spent and they're proud at what their country has been able to
*16:43.200- 16:47.540* :  achieve. They desperately want their team to go away and win this tournament as well to top it all
*16:47.540- 16:54.540* :  off, but they've got away with the win in their first match. Alex Kapstik, a pair of strange-looking
*16:54.540- 17:01.360* :  Peruvian figurines and a three-fingered hand found in a cardboard box at Lima Airport are not,
*17:01.360- 17:07.460* :  you may be surprised to hear, alien mummies. That has been confirmed by prosecutors in the
*17:07.460- 17:15.040* :  Andean nation as Rachel Wright explains. At a dramatic press conference, officials presented
*17:15.040- 17:21.680* :  two dolls about 30 centimetres tall. One was a broken naked man and the other apparently female
*17:21.680- 17:28.080* :  in a pink and yellow long dress with a yellow headdress, a nod to traditional Andean attire.
*17:28.560- 17:34.300* :  Appearing alongside them, a gruesome-looking three-fingered hand. These objects were seized in
*17:34.300- 17:39.720* :  October at a courier office in Lima Airport. Customs agents say they were destined for an
*17:39.720- 17:45.920* :  unnamed person in Mexico. At the time, some local media outlets speculated that they were aliens,
*17:45.980- 17:52.540* :  but on Friday, Flavio Estrada, a forensic expert working with Peru's prosecutors office said the
*17:52.540- 17:58.920* :  objects were not extraterrestrial, but were in fact made here on earth with paper, glue, metal,
*17:58.920- 18:08.040* :  human and animal bones. These are handmade with synthetic glues which did not exist in pre-Hispanic times,
*18:08.040- 18:14.320* :  but are from the 20th century. Unless extraterrestrials have brought their glue from another planet,
*18:14.320- 18:19.800* :  which I don't think happened. And this was not an isolated case. Just a month before these
*18:19.800- 18:25.120* :  mummies were found, journalist Jose Mousen presented similar-looking figurines,
*18:25.560- 18:28.640* :  these completely naked, to the Mexican Congress.
*18:32.280- 18:37.080* :  Spending more than three hours trying to convince them, they were aliens discovered in Peru.
*18:37.760- 18:44.280* :  Mousen had made similar claims in Peru in 2017, but they were swiftly debunked by a government report
*18:44.280- 18:51.020* :  stating the so-called alien mummies were actually recently manufactured dolls. Julieta Fiera,
*18:51.020- 18:57.060* :  an astronomer from the University of Mexico, said the dolls were a modern representation of an
*18:57.060- 19:05.200* :  ancient custom. Traditionally, when an important person died, children were buried with them.
*19:05.200- 19:08.840* :  There are many mummies of children buried with important people in Peru.
*19:09.340- 19:15.180* :  There is real sensitivity about alien conspiracies in Peru. There are widely debunked theories that
*19:15.180- 19:20.640* :  sites such as the ancient citadel at Machu Picchu, known as the local city of the Incas,
*19:20.980- 19:26.280* :  was in fact built by aliens, and indigenous communities say these claims threatened to erase
*19:26.280- 19:32.320* :  their history and heritage. In this latest case, Peruvian prosecutors have proved definitively
*19:32.320- 19:37.660* :  that the dolls were not alien mummies, so not such a close encounter after all.
*20:08.840- 20:12.420* :  It's been a turbulent time in Ecuador where a series of deadly attacks,
*20:12.420- 20:17.460* :  kidnappings, and prison riots have shocked the country and the world. Days of unrest,
*20:17.460- 20:24.060* :  or two notorious gang leaders, including Fabricio Color Pico, escape from jail, and prison guards
*20:24.060- 20:30.700* :  held hostage. The recently elected President Daniel Naboa declared a two-month state of emergency,
*20:30.700- 20:36.400* :  and the gangs retaliated by setting off car bombs, attacking schools, universities and shops,
*20:36.400- 20:41.740* :  and even stormed television studio threatening staff with guns during a live broadcast.
*20:41.740- 20:48.040* :  BBC's Central America correspondent Will Grant spoke to the President in the country's most
*20:48.040- 20:54.600* :  violent city, Guayaquil, which is also where Mr. Naboa was raised. I didn't sign up for this
*20:54.720- 20:59.580* :  thinking that he was going to be easy. It's very tough, but we cannot continue in this game,
*20:59.580- 21:03.700* :  these terrorist groups are trying to establish. Now we're starting to see changes.
*21:03.920- 21:07.800* :  The US State Department say that they're sending a delegation of law enforcement,
*21:07.800- 21:12.260* :  military, and diplomatic personnel. What's your reaction to that latest information?
*21:12.260- 21:18.680* :  I'm glad it's encouraging and to see the international community actually paying attention
*21:18.680- 21:23.600* :  now to what's going on here because I think it affects the whole world. The narco terrorists
*21:23.600- 21:29.740* :  that operate here have operations in Europe, in the US, and I think that we need to solve the
*21:29.740- 21:35.060* :  problem from the roots, and the root of the problem is here. There's currently around 178
*21:35.060- 21:41.140* :  hostages still being held in prisons around the country. You said you're not negotiating
*21:41.280- 21:45.200* :  with the armed groups, so what are you doing to try and free those men and women?
*21:45.420- 21:51.640* :  I cannot give exact details of what we're going to do, but we are in constant communication
*21:52.500- 21:58.160* :  with the armed forces and with the police. We're going to do everything in our power to bring
*21:58.160- 22:04.440* :  those people home. Where is Adolfo Macias Biemar, Elias Fito? Right now we're looking for him.
*22:04.860- 22:10.980* :  We do have a few leads. We've talked with the armed forces also with international cooperation,
*22:11.760- 22:18.560* :  and we're working on it. We cannot give any alerts, but we're going to go till the end and we're
*22:18.560- 22:22.320* :  going to find him and we're going to find a Colombia. Is Ecuador an narco state?
*22:23.580- 22:28.060* :  We are fighting every day, so it doesn't become an narco state. I do believe that we can win,
*22:28.060- 22:34.120* :  and I will never stop fighting until we win. Ecuador's president Daniel Nabewa,
*22:34.580- 22:37.780* :  speaking in an exclusive interview with the BBC's Will Grant.
*22:39.020- 22:44.280* :  On Tuesday, president Emmanuel Macron of France tried to inject a much-anticipated
*22:44.280- 22:50.620* :  new lease of life into his flagging administration by appointing a 34-year-old as Prime Minister
*22:50.860- 22:56.860* :  Gabriel Atel is one of the youngest persons to hold the position. He's also openly gay
*22:56.860- 23:03.260* :  another, first for France. So can he help President Macron halt the advance of the far right?
*23:03.620- 23:07.700* :  Our new Paris correspondent Andrew Harding has been finding out.
*23:08.600- 23:15.440* :  We've come to a market involved for a suburb of Paris, and it's here that France's new
*23:15.440- 23:21.940* :  Prime Minister, Gabriel Atel, used to be local MP. So we've come here to find out what people make
*23:21.940- 23:29.020* :  of this extremely young, 34-year-old Prime Minister, and whether he can strengthen the government and
*23:29.440- 23:35.980* :  stop France's, what seems to be a slide amongst the electorate towards the right and the far right.
*23:37.100- 23:43.380* :  Of course, he is certainly very competent, but what's your name?
*23:43.880- 23:48.300* :  Brigitte. The Brigitte here is saying he's competent, he's young, certainly, and we'll see
*23:48.300- 23:51.640* :  what happens with his politics, but he's very experienced already.
*23:51.640- 23:54.500* :  What's your name, sir? Yo, at how old are you?
*23:54.700- 24:00.580* :  49. What do you think of Atel, your new Prime Minister?
*24:00.900- 24:05.580* :  I'm a little young, I'm a little young. It's a little bit of fun in France,
*24:05.580- 24:10.920* :  which are a little bit of youth and injection of youth will put his energy into this government,
*24:10.920- 24:12.960* :  so he likes the fact that Atel is young.
*24:13.880- 24:17.540* :  I've arranged to have a coffee with the new local MP here, Claire Gisha.
*24:17.540- 24:23.160* :  She's hoping that a young Prime Minister can persuade voters to back their centrist Renaissance
*24:23.200- 24:27.260* :  party in June's European elections and not the far right.
*24:28.920- 24:32.940* :  Yes, we are very worried. You need a moderate government to manage a country.
*24:33.280- 24:38.520* :  There is real danger from the extreme right. It's true that Gabrielle Atel is the only one
*24:38.520- 24:41.620* :  who can bring people together. What do you hope he will bring?
*24:41.980- 24:47.940* :  Hope for the future. New energy. Gabrielle Atel has hit the ground running as Prime Minister.
*24:49.820- 24:57.020* :  Sympathizing with flood victims here and delivering a tough message on
*24:57.020- 25:01.920* :  law and order at a meeting this week with police officers. It's clear the government of
*25:01.920- 25:07.560* :  President Emmanuel Macron is trying to reach out to voters on the right with a tough new
*25:07.560- 25:12.660* :  immigration law. Will it work? My name is Antoine Bristiel and I work in political science,
*25:12.660- 25:19.040* :  so it's quite positive for the moment, but we will see especially during the European elections
*25:19.040- 25:24.800* :  and maybe after when Macron will have to pass unpopular laws and he still doesn't have the
*25:24.800- 25:31.440* :  majority at the national assembly. And it is this woman,
*25:31.440- 25:38.140* :  Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right national rally who could benefit. She hopes to be France's
*25:38.140- 25:42.160* :  next president and she has her own youthful team around her.
*25:42.680- 25:45.640* :  My name is Medina Bravo and I work in the communication.
*25:45.700- 25:48.360* :  I presume you're quite young. Can you tell me how old you are?
*25:48.600- 25:53.760* :  I am 24. So there's a big drift to the right in French politics as we're seeing in other parts
*25:53.760- 25:58.980* :  of Europe. Why is that? I think that people they realize that what makes sense today is the
*25:58.980- 26:05.920* :  program of Marine Le Pen. People are struggling. Are you concerned now that there is this young
*26:05.920- 26:11.720* :  prime minister Gabriella Tal, who seems very popular? Is that going to take votes away from you?
*26:12.280- 26:18.200* :  Honestly, I don't think so. He was well appreciated by French people, but I think that now he's
*26:18.200- 26:24.040* :  going to be the first minister. People are going to dislike what he does and he's going to have
*26:24.080- 26:27.800* :  decrease of popularity and he's like Emmanuel Macron at the end.
*26:27.980- 26:33.940* :  The first test will come at those European elections in June as a new generation of French
*26:33.940- 26:40.620* :  politicians step into the limelight. Andrew Harding with that report. There's been an outcry
*26:40.620- 26:46.660* :  on Russian social media after the Kremlin designated the best-selling author Boris Akunin,
*26:47.060- 26:52.900* :  a foreign agent. The blacklist already includes most leading dissidents and anti-war activists.
*26:53.460- 26:55.660* :  Here's our Europe reporter, Sasha Schlickter.
*26:56.280- 27:01.180* :  Boris Akunin's books, charting the exploits of the dashing Tsarist era detective,
*27:01.180- 27:06.900* :  Yarrast Fandorin, have enthralled an entire nation with sales pushing 20 million.
*27:06.900- 27:13.540* :  Born in Georgia as Gregorii Chartishvili, Akunin was never an establishment author. He was so
*27:13.540- 27:19.400* :  disgusted, have Vladimir Putin's Crimea land grab 10 years ago, that he left Russia for exile
*27:19.400- 27:24.480* :  here in London. Eight years later, on the day the president launched his full-scale invasion,
*27:24.480- 27:30.620* :  he wrote, Russia is ruled by psychologically deranged dictator and, worst of all,
*27:30.620- 27:37.420* :  it obediently follows his paranoia. In his ruling, Russia's Justice Ministry cited Akunin's
*27:37.440- 27:43.020* :  stand on the war and accused him of distributing false and negative information about Russia
*27:43.020- 27:49.620* :  and of helping raise money for Ukraine's military. The foreign agent designation obliges a
*27:49.620- 27:55.420* :  branded person to identify themselves as such on social media and in other publications.
*27:56.080- 27:59.580* :  Reacting to his new status, the 67-year-old author quipped,
*27:59.800- 28:03.700* :  I feel like Bin Laden, who has been handed a parking ticket.
*28:04.120- 28:11.960* :  Sasha Schlikta, the maker of the language learning app Juleyingo has laid off about 10% of its
*28:11.960- 28:16.900* :  contract employees, saying it was increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to create
*28:16.900- 28:22.900* :  lessons. This includes a feature that allows users to chat in a foreign language with an AI bot,
*28:23.340- 28:29.400* :  so could other language-based jobs be at risk? Julian Wariker asked the South Korean writer
*28:29.400- 28:33.720* :  and translator, and on her, if his job could be done by a machine.
*28:34.100- 28:40.400* :  People have this idea that translation can be very easily done by a machine. However,
*28:40.400- 28:46.120* :  a translator does a lot more than just change one language to another. We have to understand
*28:46.120- 28:52.000* :  context, we have to understand nuance, we have to understand what's trendy, and no machine learning
*28:52.000- 28:58.240* :  model that I'm familiar with is able to do that as well as a human, because there simply aren't
*28:58.420- 29:05.100* :  enough translators who can feed a model like that enough data, because if you want to create an AI
*29:05.100- 29:10.960* :  that translates as well as Anton Hurd, then you need 1,000 Anton Hurds to give it the data
*29:11.160- 29:15.980* :  that it would need, and there is only one Anton Hurd, and he was very expensive for my parents
*29:15.980- 29:22.700* :  to raise, so I really don't see this happening in my lifetime, or in my children's lifetime,
*29:22.700- 29:27.960* :  or in my grandchildren's lifetime. Why would there be so many barriers to a machine being
*29:27.960- 29:34.500* :  able to get even close to what you did? When you translate, for example, a book, and fiction
*29:34.500- 29:40.640* :  is the art of the perspective. A novel completely changes depending on who tells the same story,
*29:40.940- 29:45.740* :  and sometimes you have to make decisions in the translation process, for example, where it's written
*29:45.740- 29:51.000* :  in a first person, but you need to change that into a very close third person. I mean, that's a very
*29:51.000- 29:54.720* :  drastic change, but sometimes that's what's good for the book, and you have a discussion with the
*29:54.720- 29:59.500* :  author, and then you have a discussion with the editor, and so there are those major decisions
*29:59.500- 30:04.400* :  that make a huge difference, and AI is just not going to be able to appreciate the difference
*30:04.400- 30:09.380* :  between the two resulting narratives. Presumably in some works of fiction as well, you are coming
*30:09.380- 30:15.300* :  upon words written in the original language, which don't have already translation, they might even
*30:15.300- 30:21.060* :  be made up for the purposes of that specific work, mightn't they? Exactly. Arguably, even within
*30:21.060- 30:25.800* :  the same language, the same word does not mean the same thing for the same people. For example,
*30:25.800- 30:30.220* :  when I think of the word bicycle, I'm going to think of a different kind of bicycle. It's
*30:30.220- 30:34.260* :  going to have a different connotation for me than it does when you think of the word bicycle,
*30:34.260- 30:39.680* :  and we're speaking the same language, and we're saying the same word. So if this kind of discrepancy
*30:39.680- 30:44.980* :  exists within speakers of the same language, it's going to be even worse across different languages.
*30:44.980- 30:49.880* :  It's like what the famous translator Jeremy Tiant says. We don't translate words, we translate
*30:49.880- 30:57.460* :  vibes, and until you can find an AI that understands vibes, you're not going to have
*30:57.460- 31:03.960* :  AI that is able to translate as well as a human being. And on her speaking to Julian Warica,
*31:04.940- 31:11.760* :  Saturday was a chance to wish all our listeners happy Knutzmas. Yes, St Knutzday is the
*31:11.760- 31:18.800* :  20th day of Christmas, and it celebrated in Sweden and Finland as the last day of that holiday season,
*31:18.800- 31:24.360* :  traditionally Swedes and Finns smashed gingerbread houses, dance round their trees,
*31:24.760- 31:30.180* :  then strip them of decorations, eating the edible ones, and then dispose of them. Some get burned
*31:30.180- 31:36.160* :  for heat, but in Sweden they've also revived an older custom as our Europe Regional Editor,
*31:36.520- 31:42.460* :  Danny Abahart explains. What to do with your festive tree? If it's not a reusable plastic one,
*31:42.460- 31:48.780* :  or a live one in a pot, it's a dilemma wherever Christmas is celebrated, and as this stock home
*31:48.780- 31:54.660* :  resident explained, often a sad one at that. In Sweden you give the Christmas tree a personality,
*31:54.660- 32:03.160* :  you take it in and you choose it very carefully, and then you live with it. It's also a bit
*32:03.160- 32:07.880* :  sadness of time passing by. Swedes even sing about throwing them away.
*32:11.860- 32:17.360* :  But cheer up, there may after all be life after death, even if that means paradoxically
*32:17.360- 32:26.480* :  sending your fur or spruce to a watery grave. Since 2016, a Swedish sports fishing association
*32:26.480- 32:31.300* :  has tossed more than a thousand trees into the icy winter seas off stock home.
*32:31.720- 32:37.420* :  We tied three or four together, and then we tied them to a weight, in this case rocks in a bag,
*32:37.660- 32:43.580* :  everything's quite agreeable, and then we throw them out into the water, and they will sink
*32:43.580- 32:48.940* :  down to the bottom. Marlin Shaline of Sport Fiskana told the AFP news agency
*32:48.940- 32:54.840* :  their dense branches and needles provided great spawning grounds for fish, with plenty of places
*32:54.840- 32:59.440* :  for the young ones to hide. It's helping replace lost natural habitats.
*33:00.080- 33:04.480* :  If we look around here, there's been a lot of building, we have a lot of boats going in and out,
*33:04.600- 33:11.440* :  so we need to keep these coastal ways clear. There's not a lot of reefs, and those are really
*33:11.440- 33:16.960* :  important habitats for fish that I've gone missing. The association aims to use only trees that
*33:16.960- 33:21.560* :  haven't been sprayed with pesticides. Environmentalists have welcomed the initiative.
*33:22.280- 33:26.980* :  Many coastal wetlands, important fish breeding grounds, have been lost to agriculture
*33:27.460- 33:31.640* :  as marshes are drained, so you can be cool for fish too.
*33:36.160- 33:37.160* :  Dani Abahart
*33:40.100- 33:44.920* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News
*33:44.920- 33:51.560* :  podcast at the same time tomorrow. This edition was mixed by Davyth Evans, and the producer
*33:52.280- 33:58.100* :  was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson. Until next time, goodbye.
