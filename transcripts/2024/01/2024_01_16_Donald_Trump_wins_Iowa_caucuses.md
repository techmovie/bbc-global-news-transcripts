*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.840* :  by advertising. As a person with a very deep voice, I'm hired all the time for advertising campaigns,
*00:20.840- 00:26.700* :  but a deep voice doesn't sell B2B. An advertising on the wrong platform doesn't sell B2B either.
*00:27.040- 00:31.940* :  That's why if you're a B2B marketer, you should use LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn has the targeting
*00:31.940- 00:36.540* :  capabilities to help you reach the world's largest professional audience. That's right,
*00:36.540- 00:42.360* :  over 70 million decision makers all in one place. All the big wigs, then medium wigs,
*00:42.360- 00:47.220* :  also small wigs who are on the path to becoming big wigs. Okay, that's enough about wigs.
*00:47.460- 00:51.660* :  LinkedIn ads allows you to focus on getting your B2B message to the right people.
*00:52.100- 00:57.280* :  So does that mean you should use ads on LinkedIn instead of hiring me, the man with the deepest
*00:57.280- 01:04.000* :  voice in the world? Yes, yes it does. Get started today and see why LinkedIn is the place to be
*01:04.000- 01:10.520* :  to be. We'll even give you a $100 credit on your next campaign. Go to LinkedIn.com slash results

*01:18.580- 01:25.020* :  America's America's from BBC News. Hey, they're just in web here from the America's podcast
*01:25.020- 01:31.120* :  up in podcasting through the night from Iowa with my podcast buddies chatting about the caucus here.
*01:31.120- 01:35.740* :  We've got to have a talk with Eric Trump. How many more primaries you have to go through before
*01:35.740- 01:40.540* :  it's just obvious that he is the presumptive nominee. I'm certain it will be done by super Tuesday.
*01:40.540- 01:45.700* :  You can listen to the whole America's episode right now. It's available wherever you get your podcast.
*01:57.740- 02:00.780* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*02:03.220- 02:08.440* :  I'm Janet Jolale and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 16th of January. These are our main stories.
*02:09.180- 02:13.240* :  Donald Trump's immense his position as a front runner for the Republican presidential
*02:13.240- 02:19.840* :  nomination with a landslide victory in Iowa's caucuses. The US says it seized Iranian weaponry
*02:19.840- 02:25.980* :  being taken to houthy militants in Yemen as it also condemns Iranian missile strikes on Iraqi
*02:25.980- 02:32.140* :  Kurdistan that have killed several people. Health authorities in northern Ethiopia warn of a
*02:32.300- 02:38.240* :  deepening hunger crisis in Tigray after more than 200 people die in one town alone.
*02:40.900- 02:41.700* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:46.560- 02:52.920* :  TV drama succession cleans up this year's Emmy Awards where one award winner gave a rather
*02:53.180- 02:55.820* :  unusual tribute. I want to thank me.
*02:58.520- 03:02.760* :  Bob are leaving in me and doing what they said I could not do.
*03:07.280- 03:11.960* :  Despite his legal woes and false claims about the last US presidential election,
*03:11.960- 03:18.340* :  Donald Trump has one big in the first contest of what he hopes will be his path back to the White House.
*03:19.160- 03:24.520* :  He wrapped up 51% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses with his supporters turning out despite
*03:24.520- 03:29.180* :  unusually cold weather, even for this small rural Midwestern state.
*03:29.580- 03:34.720* :  The Florida governor, Ronda Santis, who's dedicated a huge amount of time and resources to Iowa,
*03:35.260- 03:40.980* :  managed to come a distant second, narrowly beating Nikki Haley, who was ambassador to the UN
*03:40.980- 03:47.080* :  under Mr. Trump. Despite being plagued by sexual assault allegations, the former US president won
*03:47.080- 03:52.500* :  the support of Christian conservatives who've warmed to him after his three supreme court picks
*03:52.900- 03:58.520* :  helped to make abortion illegal in many parts of the US. Our North America correspondent Nomiya
*03:58.520- 04:04.400* :  Iqbal reports. So we're going to put America first. We're going to make America great again.
*04:04.400- 04:10.000* :  Iowa, we love you. For Donald Trump, winning Iowa was important. This was the first official
*04:10.000- 04:16.980* :  2024 test of his popularity with Republican voters. We want to thank the great people of Iowa.
*04:17.260- 04:18.440* :  Thank you. We love you all.
*04:19.520- 04:24.440* :  We want to turn out what a crowd. The big question was always who would be second place.
*04:25.580- 04:31.240* :  Ronda Santis, the Florida governor, secured that. I can tell you because of your support,
*04:31.260- 04:36.260* :  everyone against us, we've got our ticket punched out of Iowa.
*04:38.760- 04:41.620* :  With Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, finishing third.
*04:41.620- 04:45.580* :  We look at how we're doing in New Hampshire.
*04:46.160- 04:51.740* :  Tonight, I'll make this Republican Prime Minister a two person rep.
*04:54.200- 04:59.060* :  It gives them both much-needed momentum in a contest that has been dominated by Trump.
*05:01.300- 05:06.000* :  The tech entrepreneur, Vivek Ramaswamy, who was seen as an outsider, has suspended his campaign
*05:06.000- 05:11.840* :  and is now fully backing Trump. There is no path for me to be the next president.
*05:11.840- 05:15.060* :  Absent things that we don't want to see happen in this country.
*05:16.900- 05:22.300* :  Votes were tallyed at thousands of locations around the state, including this local high school.
*05:22.480- 05:29.180* :  So everyone finds your balance for tonight. You are able to write one person's name on it
*05:29.620- 05:32.260* :  and then, after we're done, we're going to put all of them in the hat.
*05:33.780- 05:37.940* :  Des Moines Mayor Connie Boson said there were concerns that the Arctic weather conditions
*05:38.060- 05:42.200* :  could affect voter turnout. It's so bitter cold, so I think some people
*05:43.260- 05:46.340* :  will do what they can to get out, but we'll see.
*05:52.100- 05:54.280* :  But many people were determined to show up.
*05:56.140- 05:56.360* :  Trump?
*05:58.280- 05:58.840* :  DeSantis?
*06:01.060- 06:07.380* :  Trump? This is how a caucus works. People have turned up at this local high school cafeteria
*06:07.380- 06:11.940* :  at precinct to cast their votes. The votes are then added up and the results
*06:12.380- 06:15.520* :  went out to them. Donald Trump has won this precinct.
*06:17.860- 06:21.360* :  Tyler voted for Donald Trump. My family are on the other side of town,
*06:21.360- 06:24.220* :  they're voting Trump. Everybody I work with is voting Trump.
*06:24.220- 06:29.160* :  Yeah, it's I'm surprised that there is other people that weren't voting for Trump to be honest,
*06:29.160- 06:32.060* :  but that's my narrow narrow minded thinking, I guess.
*06:32.280- 06:36.820* :  But not everyone supported Trump. Clay was backing Rhonda Santas.
*06:37.140- 06:41.620* :  I have not been impressed with his character over the last few years, especially since
*06:43.040- 06:47.060* :  the way he handled the results of the 2020 election.
*06:47.420- 06:51.720* :  Whoever wins the Republican nomination will face a Democrat, almost certainly Joe Biden
*06:51.720- 06:56.960* :  in the November presidential election. But Iowa is only the first step in securing who gets
*06:56.960- 07:01.400* :  to head up the Republican party. The official winner won't be announced until the summer.
*07:01.400- 07:05.920* :  It's a marathon, not a sprint, but with the starting gun fired,
*07:06.520- 07:09.200* :  Donald Trump has pulled way ahead in the race.
*07:12.260- 07:15.620* :  Less than a week after it carried out strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen
*07:15.700- 07:17.600* :  who have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea,
*07:17.600- 07:23.160* :  the US says that it seized advanced Iranian weapons that were being transported to the Houthis.
*07:23.160- 07:28.000* :  The shipment was intercepted last week, but news has only emerged today.
*07:28.600- 07:33.380* :  Components for medium-range ballistic and cruise missiles were among the material seized,
*07:33.380- 07:39.620* :  but two members of the elite US Navy SEAL force are still missing after the mission.
*07:40.000- 07:42.580* :  I got more from my Middle East correspondent, Hugo Bacheca.
*07:43.260- 07:48.240* :  So the US military said it was the first time that weapons supplied by Iran
*07:48.240- 07:55.440* :  that were being transported to the Houthis were seized since the beginning of these attacks by
*07:55.440- 08:02.720* :  the Houthis on vessels in the Red Sea. And they said these weapons included components for
*08:02.720- 08:10.520* :  Iranian-made ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and they said that initial analysis of these
*08:10.520- 08:16.340* :  weapons suggested that the same kinds of weapons had been used by the Houthis to target ships
*08:16.340- 08:23.140* :  in the Red Sea. And again, we know that the Houthis are supported by Iran.
*08:23.640- 08:29.380* :  The accusation being made by Western officials is that the Iranians are giving weapons,
*08:29.380- 08:35.500* :  have been training the Houthis, and have also been given intelligence information for the Houthis
*08:35.840- 08:40.920* :  to carry out those attacks. And there has been a lot of concern about these attacks that have
*08:40.920- 08:45.540* :  been carried out by the Houthis and the impact that this is having on the global economy.
*08:45.840- 08:50.300* :  And in fact, in the last hour or so, we're hearing that a cargo ship has been hit by a missile
*08:50.300- 08:55.400* :  in the Red Sea. And I think this shows that the Houthis continue to have the ability to carry out
*08:55.400- 09:01.800* :  these attacks. Last week, the US and the UK carried out dozens of airstrikes targeting Houthi
*09:01.800- 09:07.400* :  positions in Yemen. They said it was to guarantee the freedom of navigation. Again, we've seen
*09:07.400- 09:13.280* :  that these attacks have caused major disruption to global trade. And I think reports, you know,
*09:13.280- 09:18.820* :  on the weekend, suggested that less than a third of the positions used by the Houthis
*09:19.380- 09:26.400* :  were either damaged or destroyed. So the Houthis continue to pose a major threat to ships in the
*09:26.400- 09:31.960* :  Red Sea. And they say that these attacks are going to continue. So I think the main question here
*09:32.400- 09:39.220* :  is over, you know, a possible response from this US led coalition, if you like. Will there be
*09:39.220- 09:45.280* :  more attacks on the Houthis to try to hit the infrastructure, the positions, the capacity they
*09:45.280- 09:51.420* :  have to continue with these attacks? Hugo Bashega. Meanwhile, Iran itself has carried out
*09:51.420- 09:57.300* :  missile strikes on targets in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region. They've been condemned by
*09:57.300- 10:02.180* :  Baghdad, which has recalled its ambassador from Tehran and by the US, which has called them
*10:02.180- 10:07.960* :  reckless and imprecise. Iran's revolutionary guards said they'd struck what they claimed were
*10:07.960- 10:14.000* :  ready spy headquarters in Kurdistan. Local officials say several people were killed.
*10:14.620- 10:17.540* :  Habib Shema Haroon's house was damaged in the strike.
*10:20.220- 10:26.420* :  We were sitting safely and peacefully in our house. Suddenly, we heard a big explosion,
*10:26.420- 10:32.140* :  which caused glass to shatter in all the windows of this house. I mean, it's a village,
*10:32.140- 10:37.440* :  and the people who are living here are mostly families. We have no issues with anyone.
*10:38.040- 10:41.720* :  We don't even have a police station in the village. I don't know why they did this.
*10:42.860- 10:47.500* :  So, is this a new escalation of the conflict in the Middle East? I heard more from
*10:47.500- 10:53.120* :  Paham Gabbari of BBC Persian. It can be interpreted that way. Today, although, as you mentioned,
*10:53.120- 10:59.160* :  Iran does not say directly that it has actually proxies, and it says that I only support,
*10:59.160- 11:03.060* :  for example, Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah, but they're not directly my proxies.
*11:03.460- 11:09.580* :  Very today, to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Al-Humaneh said that he actually praised Houthis
*11:09.580- 11:14.840* :  in Yemen for continuing the fight against the West. And these attacks, according to Iran's
*11:14.840- 11:22.060* :  revolutionary guard, were carried out by 24 ballistic missiles against two countries in a city
*11:22.060- 11:28.000* :  called Talteta in Idlib region, which is mostly controlled by Bashar al-Assad's opponents.
*11:28.000- 11:33.880* :  It is struck there, one in Syria, and also Erbil in Iraq. Iran said that the one in
*11:33.880- 11:38.860* :  Erbil is a spyhead quarter. There's no way to corroborate that information. However,
*11:38.860- 11:47.180* :  what we know from Kurdish side is that a construction mogul has been killed in this attack. His name
*11:47.180- 11:52.320* :  is Pishroderze. So, given all the concerns about conflict escalating in the Middle East,
*11:53.060- 11:55.940* :  why has Iran carried these attacks out now, do we think?
*11:56.580- 12:00.680* :  So, last week, there was an attack against Iran in the southern city of Keremah, when
*12:01.720- 12:07.600* :  and on the anniversary of slain Iranian general Qasim Soleimani. Over 90 people were killed,
*12:08.160- 12:13.700* :  Islamic state claimed responsibility for that attack. Now, in revolutionary guards statement
*12:13.700- 12:18.980* :  last night, it was mentioned that the attack against Syria and against what they called
*12:18.980- 12:24.580* :  was ISIS was actually a revenge for the attacks that took place in Iran. However,
*12:24.580- 12:30.140* :  according to the previous statements by revolutionary guard, the person who carried out the suicide
*12:30.140- 12:35.800* :  attack in Iran was trained in Afghanistan. Then why are you targeting Syria and not
*12:35.800- 12:40.300* :  Afghanistan? That's not clear. I suppose one key thing about these attacks is that no US
*12:40.300- 12:46.020* :  facilities or personnel were hit, but there was a risk that could have happened, and it could
*12:46.020- 12:51.220* :  happen if Iran does this again, and that could then bring the US into direct conflict with Iran.
*12:51.220- 12:56.460* :  That's correct. So, Iran appears to be having a military doctrine, that is,
*12:56.960- 13:02.680* :  rising the tension, flexing its muscles, however, short of getting involved in a full-scale war.
*13:03.060- 13:08.720* :  And they are doing that so far through hitting targets, for example, in it leap, in it leap,
*13:08.720- 13:15.000* :  in airfield, and through their proxies, houthis in the Red Sea. However, they have never so far
*13:15.000- 13:20.100* :  engaged directly or hitting directly the US personnel. They'll try to avoid that,
*13:20.480- 13:23.020* :  because they know that it might have dire consequences.
*13:24.100- 13:30.020* :  Baham Gabbadi. Well, since the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October, more than 80 reporters and
*13:30.020- 13:34.540* :  media workers have been killed in Gaza, according to the committee to protect journalists.
*13:35.260- 13:40.920* :  The Al-Jazeera Gaza Bureau Chief, while Al-Dadu, is one of very few journalists still broadcasting
*13:40.920- 13:47.220* :  out of the territory. He has lost three generations of his family in the war, including his wife
*13:47.220- 13:52.620* :  and grandchild. His eldest son, Hamza, who also worked for Al-Jazeera, was killed last week,
*13:52.900- 13:59.060* :  alongside his colleague in an Israeli strike. Israel has denied claims that it deliberately targets
*13:59.060- 14:03.000* :  journalists, while Al-Dadu has been speaking to BBC Arabic.
*14:06.960- 14:11.120* :  Palestinian journalists in this war have become displaced, homeless,
*14:11.840- 14:18.360* :  and are working from the streets, from tents. They lack food, water, clothes, even toilets,
*14:18.980- 14:24.100* :  and there's a shortage of safety equipment and protection. We have never faced such challenges
*14:24.100- 14:29.440* :  in previous wars. Needless to say, what happened to me personally is an example.
*14:29.440- 14:35.640* :  My family were targeted in an area they had been displaced to. They thought it was safe as the
*14:35.640- 14:41.900* :  Israeli occupation army had said, but the targeting was direct. It martyred my wife, my son
*14:41.900- 14:49.380* :  Mahmoud, my daughter Sham, and my grandson Adam. I lost another 14 relatives who were killed in that
*14:49.380- 14:55.540* :  strike. They targeted my house in Gaza City, the house my family fled from, and destroyed it.
*14:55.760- 15:00.900* :  Then they hit Al-Jazeera Channel Bureau and my office in it. They targeted me personally,
*15:01.620- 15:07.420* :  martyred my colleague Samir Abu Dakhra, who was with me. I'm still injured and require
*15:07.420- 15:13.140* :  treatment outside the Gaza Strip. They also killed my first born Hamza recently. This is a very
*15:13.140- 15:20.680* :  high price, very hurtful pain, and totally unjustified. This leads us to raise major questions.
*15:21.220- 15:26.320* :  Where are the international organizations, the press institutions, and the humanitarian
*15:27.200- 15:32.040* :  organizations? We are conducting a humanitarian mission in the first place. We're not a party to
*15:32.040- 15:38.160* :  the war or a battle. We only carry our duty, which is guaranteed by international laws and
*15:38.160- 15:44.700* :  agreements. But despite these major strikes, nobody has done what is needed, and that is why the
*15:44.700- 15:50.980* :  targeting continues. What is required for all these institutions to form serious and real pressure
*15:50.980- 15:58.300* :  on Israel, to make Israel realize it will genuinely be held accountable, and pay for these
*15:58.300- 16:04.120* :  killings on targeting, until these strikes stop, until the killing aimed at the journalist in the
*16:04.120- 16:12.900* :  Gaza Strip ends. Al-Jazeera Channelist while Al-Dadu, who has become a symbol of the huge
*16:12.900- 16:17.540* :  personal sacrifices, journalists in Gaza have made to report on the war.
*16:19.100- 16:24.740* :  The world's biggest iceberg, known as A23A, first broke away from the Antarctic coastline
*16:24.740- 16:30.440* :  more than 30 years ago, but it's only recently begun a big migration, which could eventually
*16:30.440- 16:36.980* :  see melt altogether. But as the iceberg is gradually worn away by warmer air and waters,
*16:37.520- 16:43.200* :  it's turned into a massive natural work of art, with fast caves and arches cut into its frozen
*16:43.200- 16:50.600* :  walls. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos told us more. We've been following A23A on its
*16:50.600- 16:56.540* :  travels for the past couple of years. You say it first carved from the Antarctic coastline
*16:56.540- 17:01.820* :  way back in 1986, immediately got stuck on the sea floor, didn't move. It's like an ice island for
*17:02.380- 17:08.260* :  decades. Then it started to get going, and we've been following it from space satellites. It's so big,
*17:08.260- 17:14.120* :  so this thing is about 4,000 square kilometers in size, and you're going to see that from space.
*17:14.420- 17:19.400* :  It's twice that, more than twice the size of Greater London. It's that big. Big of the most cities.
*17:19.580- 17:23.660* :  Big of the most cities. Of course, the thing is you want to get up close and see what it's like,
*17:23.660- 17:30.960* :  and an expedition got there on Sunday, and they found it starting to crumble at its edges.
*17:30.960- 17:37.420* :  This thing is starting to spill beyond the Antarctic domain, beyond its main area,
*17:37.420- 17:42.060* :  beyond the Antarctic peninsula, a bit of land that sticks up towards South America,
*17:42.440- 17:49.180* :  sweeping out their north towards the South Atlantic. As it does so, it's encountering warmer air,
*17:49.560- 17:55.900* :  warmer surface waters, and that's cutting these unusual features in the sides of the Great
*17:55.900- 18:01.900* :  Burg. This thing is 300 meters thick, right, in places. But even so, these cathedral-like catacombs,
*18:02.180- 18:07.940* :  great buttresses are being cut into the side of this Burg, which is all indicative that it's under
*18:07.940- 18:13.380* :  attack. Now, you know, for decades, it's been living in a freezing environment, and now it's
*18:13.580- 18:18.980* :  come out of the fridge, if you like, and as it moves north, then it'll get attacked more and more,
*18:18.980- 18:24.160* :  and eventually it's going to fracture, and it's going to all split apart, and friends are going to
*18:24.160- 18:29.860* :  melt away. Sounds like a shame, because it does sound very beautiful. So, what impact will this
*18:30.020- 18:34.140* :  melting away have? You know, these icebergs are really interesting. We call them tabular
*18:34.140- 18:41.260* :  burks, because their tops are quite flat. They look like a tabletop, tabular, okay. But they play
*18:41.260- 18:46.460* :  quite a crucial role in the environments of the Southern Ocean, because during their lifetime,
*18:46.460- 18:51.180* :  you know, they were once part of glasses that scraped along the rockbed of Antarctica. They pick
*18:51.580- 18:56.880* :  up mineral dust, dust settles on them from the atmosphere, and as they go out into the ocean,
*18:56.880- 19:02.240* :  and they melt, they drop this, this dust into the ocean, and that seeds life, you know, the
*19:02.260- 19:08.700* :  lowest forms of life, plankton. Very often you will see a plankton bloom in the trail of a great
*19:08.700- 19:13.820* :  iceberg, as it's moving through the ocean, and of course, then the smaller creatures feed on the plankton,
*19:14.280- 19:18.260* :  and, you know, the fish, and then you go up through the food chain, you know, the penguins,
*19:18.260- 19:24.480* :  the seals, the great whales. So they all owe their existence, we're not completely, but, you know,
*19:24.660- 19:31.080* :  it's part of that web of life. These icebergs are part of that. You see great whales swimming
*19:31.080- 19:36.500* :  in the ocean, the Southern Ocean. There is a link from them to these great icebergs as well.
*19:36.880- 19:43.500* :  Jonathan Amos. Still to come in the global news podcast, the investor
*19:43.500- 19:49.340* :  gives journalists who led Guinness World Records to pause its oldest dog category.
*19:49.660- 19:54.820* :  They said that they'd confirmed his age at 31 of the time. I just thought, yeah, that sounds kind
*19:54.820- 20:03.900* :  of unlikely, that sounds pretty old. This is the story of the charismatic Nigerian preacher,
*20:03.900- 20:11.200* :  TB Joshua. Some called him a miracle worker. He healed his sick, the limb walks a great man of
*20:11.260- 20:17.880* :  God. Others say they knew a very different man. He's not this holy man. What happened to me and to
*20:17.880- 20:24.380* :  others? Should not happen to any human being. This is World of Secrets from the BBC World Service.

*20:37.680- 20:42.340* :  As a person with a very deep voice, I'm hired all the time for advertising campaigns,
*20:42.340- 20:48.160* :  but a deep voice doesn't sell B2B. An advertising on the wrong platform doesn't sell B2B either.
*20:48.500- 20:53.400* :  That's why if you're a B2B marketer, you should use LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn has the targeting
*20:53.400- 20:58.000* :  capabilities to help you reach the world's largest professional audience. That's right.
*20:58.000- 21:03.820* :  Over 70 million decision-makers all in one place. All the bigwigs, then mediumwigs,
*21:03.820- 21:08.660* :  also smallwigs, who are on the path to becoming bigwigs. Okay, that's enough about wigs.
*21:08.940- 21:13.120* :  LinkedIn ads allows you to focus on getting your B2B message to the right people.
*21:13.560- 21:18.740* :  So, does that mean you should use ads on LinkedIn instead of hiring me, the man with the deepest
*21:18.740- 21:25.440* :  voice in the world? Yes, yes it does. Get started today and see why LinkedIn is the place to be,

*21:39.920- 21:47.040* :  America's from BBC News. Hey there, Justin Webb here from the America's podcast. I've been
*21:47.040- 21:52.600* :  podcasting through the night from Iowa with my podcast buddies chatting about the caucus here,
*21:52.600- 21:56.900* :  we've got to have a talk with Eric Trump. How many more primaries do you have to go through
*21:56.900- 22:01.020* :  before? It's just obvious that he is the presumptive nominee. I'm certain it will be done by
*22:01.020- 22:06.580* :  Super Tuesday. You can listen to the whole America's episode right now. It's available wherever you
*22:20.640- 22:22.580* :  get your podcast. Welcome back to the Global News podcast.
*22:23.220- 22:28.560* :  Integrie Ethiopia's northernmost state health officials have renewed their warnings about
*22:28.560- 22:34.740* :  starvation. They say that more than 200 people have died in the town of Edaga,
*22:34.740- 22:40.020* :  Arby, alone. After the worst drought in decades and in the aftermath of civil war,
*22:40.460- 22:45.440* :  the UN is reporting that 20 million people in the region require food aid.
*22:46.200- 22:49.900* :  However, despite this, the federal government is rejecting the notion of a famine
*22:50.540- 22:55.540* :  in a country where the Ethiopian food crisis of the mid-1980s still resonates deeply.
*22:56.440- 23:01.320* :  I asked our correspondent in Addis Ababa, Kalkedan Ybel-Tel, whether it was reasonable to call
*23:01.320- 23:06.360* :  the situation a famine. It doesn't appear that way yet, but there have been warnings from
*23:06.960- 23:11.080* :  different outlets, different humanitarian organizations that things could get worse,
*23:11.080- 23:17.600* :  and then they might gradually evolve into a mass-scale famine. A few weeks ago, the regional authorities
*23:17.600- 23:22.560* :  integrate where in a sort of row with the federal authorities when they say that a massive
*23:22.560- 23:28.000* :  famine is looming and unless urgent and drastic measures are taken, more than 90 percent
*23:28.000- 23:32.980* :  of the region's population could be facing starvation. As of now, what we know is different
*23:32.980- 23:39.320* :  districts are providing figures of diseases, and it seems that the number is growing by H.T.
*23:39.320- 23:43.980* :  The number of diseases is growing by H.T. The latest that we are hearing is from a small town
*23:43.980- 23:51.340* :  called Edaga, Arby, which is housing quite a number of farmers who are fleeing this drought,
*23:51.340- 23:57.540* :  and then trying to seek aid there. They say that 209 people have died in the past few
*23:57.540- 24:02.720* :  months from starvation, and more people could die in the coming months unless measures are taken.
*24:02.720- 24:08.900* :  In another district, there was a report that 16 displaced people have died in the past three
*24:08.900- 24:13.360* :  months because of drought. Now, these people were pushed out of their homes because of the war,
*24:13.720- 24:19.040* :  and after the war ended, with a pistol came a drought, and now they are facing the compounded
*24:19.040- 24:26.260* :  effects of the two crises. And in terms of help, is the government doing all it can, and what
*24:26.260- 24:30.220* :  about international help given that there are so many other crises elsewhere in the world?
*24:30.580- 24:36.320* :  Yes, one of the things that have worsened the situation is not sufficient aid is being provided
*24:36.320- 24:42.900* :  because last year around March, the U.S. aid agency, as well as the UN, announced that
*24:42.900- 24:49.020* :  they were suspending food aid to the dry region because of what they called massive food theft.
*24:49.380- 24:54.180* :  In July, they have suspended their food aid across Ethiopia, as well. So for months,
*24:54.180- 25:00.200* :  there hadn't been any food aid coming from these two large organizations. Around December,
*25:00.200- 25:05.060* :  they said that they were resuming their efforts, their operations, after some reforming measures
*25:05.060- 25:10.360* :  were taken, but we understand that the level of need and the level of aid that's being provided
*25:10.880- 25:14.640* :  are not, you know, meeting their knots, and not enough is being done so far.
*25:18.080- 25:22.000* :  The Chinese Premier has spent the day trying to convince some of the world's wealthiest and
*25:22.000- 25:28.440* :  most influential people that his country is still a global economic powerhouse. Li Chiang
*25:28.440- 25:33.660* :  addressed the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland, urging the
*25:33.660- 25:40.080* :  political and corporate leaders in attendance to continue investing in China, despite a raft
*25:40.080- 25:45.560* :  of recent financial and diplomatic setbacks. Mickey Bristol is our Asia-Pacific regional editor.
*25:45.760- 25:50.000* :  He told my colleague, Kylie Pentello, more about what's behind this plea.
*25:50.580- 25:54.660* :  The background to that is that over the last couple of years, foreign companies which
*25:54.660- 25:59.340* :  over recent years have invested billions and billions of dollars in China, involved in all kinds
*25:59.340- 26:04.220* :  of industries have started pulling their money out of there for a number of concerns.
*26:05.060- 26:10.960* :  One political, the Western China at odds on a number of issues at the moment, so the
*26:11.880- 26:16.020* :  environment there isn't good, also the fault of an economy in China, and also the difficulties
*26:16.020- 26:20.460* :  sometimes of doing business in China. So these companies have pulled billions out, in fact,
*26:20.860- 26:25.360* :  they've been taken out more money than they've been putting in at the end of last year.
*26:25.360- 26:30.300* :  So what Li Chiang did in this speech was appeal to foreign companies and say,
*26:30.300- 26:35.040* :  look, China's a great place to invest, it's about opportunities, it's not about risk,
*26:35.520- 26:39.980* :  we still got a lot of development to do, industries across the board, there's a lot of places to
*26:39.980- 26:45.960* :  invest, and he asked them, despite their concerns, to continue investing in China. So that was one
*26:45.960- 26:51.560* :  of the main messages, and it was a key speech, this is Li Chiang, the premier of China, this is
*26:51.680- 26:58.800* :  perhaps the biggest speech at Davos since the Chinese president spoke there, Xi Jinping in 2017.
*26:58.820- 27:04.300* :  So obviously China is concerned about this when it coming out of China, once they make sure
*27:04.300- 27:09.760* :  that people continue investing in the country. And interestingly though, he did say that
*27:09.760- 27:15.760* :  the economy is expected to have grown around 5.2% in 2023. Yeah, give a very upbeat assessment
*27:15.760- 27:20.480* :  of the economy, as you would expect him to do Chinese communist leaders, I always give an upbeat
*27:20.480- 27:28.160* :  assessment of their economy, but in fact, following COVID, the economy in China hasn't really rebounded
*27:28.160- 27:35.540* :  as some of the leaders would have hoped, that a GDP figure of about 5% which he gave any speech,
*27:35.540- 27:41.920* :  that's still low by recent Chinese standards, good by other standards around the world, but by
*27:41.920- 27:46.700* :  Chinese standards pretty low, and there's questions about whether that's the statistics,
*27:46.700- 27:53.260* :  they're actually true, in any case. So I think it's an upbeat assessment, he did it on a number
*27:53.260- 27:58.720* :  of occasions, he talked about urban renewal, infrastructure, still requiring growth, but of course
*27:58.720- 28:04.040* :  the background to that isn't quite as good, for example, Evergrande, a major property developer,
*28:04.740- 28:10.220* :  as hundreds of billions of dollars in debt, perhaps will collapse, you know, and people out
*28:10.220- 28:14.880* :  buying houses like they used to, and Li Chang there in his speech said that they would be in the
*28:14.880- 28:20.660* :  future. Well, recent evidence would suggest the opposite, so it was an upbeat assessment, but what
*28:20.660- 28:27.460* :  not one which records with an entirely with reality. Mickey Bristol, last year there was much
*28:27.460- 28:33.240* :  excitement when Bobby the dog was hailed as a world's oldest canine at more than 30 years old,
*28:33.680- 28:40.180* :  however, doubts have now emerged about whether he really was such an old dog after all. Guinness
*28:40.180- 28:46.740* :  world records say there's now a pause in his record while they investigate Sean Wales reports.
*28:47.260- 28:55.040* :  Bobby happily lived out of the spotlight for more than 30 years, but when he was revealed as the
*28:55.040- 29:00.800* :  world's oldest dog to ever live last year, his story engrossed much of the globe. The oldest
*29:00.800- 29:07.340* :  dog to ever live, the secrets to raising a dog to 31, the headlines read. Guinness world records
*29:07.340- 29:14.480* :  ratified Bobby's achievement, breaking the previous record set in 1939 by an Australian dog who lived
*29:14.480- 29:21.480* :  to 29, but there were some suspicions. Bobby's breed has a life expectancy of 12 to 14 years.
*29:21.480- 29:26.820* :  Matt Reynolds from Wide Magazine wasn't convinced, so he started doing some digging.
*29:26.820- 29:31.340* :  Guinness world records said it's verified Bobby's age with a Portuguese government database
*29:31.340- 29:37.600* :  called SIAC, and they said that they'd confirmed his age at 31 at the time. I just thought,
*29:37.600- 29:41.160* :  yeah, that sounds kind of unlikely, that sounds pretty old, you know, I think like a lot of people.
*29:41.640- 29:47.260* :  He's now found there's no documentation with Portuguese authorities dating back to 1992
*29:47.880- 29:52.740* :  when Bobby was supposedly born. Going off something that the owner had told the database
*29:52.740- 29:57.160* :  at the point at which they registered the dog year, registered in 2022 and said the dog's 30 years
*29:57.160- 30:01.680* :  old now as opposed to having data right that went all the way back to the dog's birth.
*30:01.960- 30:07.580* :  Bobby's record is now up in the air. Guinness world records has confirmed to the BBC it has temporarily
*30:07.580- 30:12.580* :  paused the record for oldest ever dog and is in the middle of a formal review process.
*30:13.600- 30:18.740* :  Sean Wales, four months later than planned, the stars of a small screen have gathered in Los Angeles
*30:18.740- 30:24.700* :  to honour the most successful shows on television. Succession, the bear and beef were the big winners
*30:24.700- 30:29.360* :  at the Emmy Awards, which were delayed because of the Hollywood strikes. Our L.A. correspondent
*30:29.360- 30:36.740* :  Emma Vardy was watching. The good times were back as the biggest names in Hollywood gathered
*30:36.740- 30:43.760* :  to celebrate the best of the small screen. I'm a winner, baby. After five previous nominations,
*30:43.980- 30:49.540* :  Neesey Nashbets was finally a winner for her role playing the neighbour of a serial killer
*30:49.900- 30:54.460* :  in the Jeffrey Dahmer story. Thank you. And you know who I want to thank? I want to thank me.
*30:57.160- 31:02.980* :  But believe it in me, and doing what they said I could not do. And I want to say to myself
*31:02.980- 31:07.340* :  in front of all you beautiful people. Go on, girl, which you'll best.
*31:08.520- 31:12.520* :  The bear, a story about a high-end chef in a rundown sandwich shop,
*31:12.760- 31:18.540* :  dominated the comedy category for the best actor win for Jeremy Alan White and best supporting
*31:18.540- 31:23.980* :  actress for I.O. Adebrae, which we thank her parents, who immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria.
*31:24.380- 31:32.700* :  I love you guys so much. Thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful
*31:32.800- 31:40.660* :  and black and proud of all of that. I just love you so much. Probably not like a dream to
*31:40.660- 31:45.580* :  immigrate to this country and have your child be like, I want to do improv, but you're real ones.
*31:45.580- 31:50.480* :  Winter Bronson made history winning best actress in a comedy for the show she created
*31:51.020- 31:56.080* :  Abbot Elementary, becoming the first black woman to win the award in more than 40 years.
*31:56.680- 32:05.280* :  Succession. Succession with its farewell season dominated one last time. Sarah Snoop picking up
*32:05.280- 32:10.100* :  best actress in a drama and best actor for Kieran Culkin, who plays Roman Roy.
*32:10.100- 32:13.520* :  I wasted all my time hugging everybody. I love you all so much.
*32:14.660- 32:21.300* :  Especially everyone in the cast Jay Allen Sarah, Brian, every single one. Thank you so much.
*32:22.320- 32:22.760* :  I love you.
*32:28.620- 32:33.560* :  Sarah Elton John joined the exclusive club of artists who won an Emmy, a Grammy,
*32:33.560- 32:37.660* :  an Oscar and a Tony Award, the 19th person to do so.
*32:41.600- 32:46.460* :  There were also moments of TV nostalgia, which saw the cast of cheers reunited
*32:46.460- 32:51.800* :  around the famous bar. But this ceremony was somewhat shoehorned into the middle of a busy
*32:51.800- 32:58.060* :  award season. It was postponed last year when months of walkouts by actors and writers over pay
*32:58.060- 33:03.180* :  and the use of AI saw productions halted. With the awards happening four months late,
*33:03.180- 33:08.600* :  it's a reminder the strikes are continuing to have an impact. And although the TV industry is
*33:08.600- 33:11.400* :  back to work, studios are tightening their budgets.
*33:19.260- 33:25.400* :  But the Emmy's highlighted the power of TV's most loved shows to hold a place in view as hearts for decades.
*33:33.060- 33:36.580* :  Charlie Pooff they're performing the theme tune to the US sitcom Friends
*33:36.700- 33:42.280* :  Intribute to its star Matthew Perry and all those who've died in the industry in the past year.
*33:45.140- 33:49.260* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:49.600- 33:53.980* :  If you want to comment on this podcast with topics covered, you can send us an email. The address

*34:10.880- 34:12.720* :  I'm Janak Jalil. Until next time, goodbye.
*34:23.420- 34:30.000* :  America's from BBC News. Hey there Justin Webb here from the America's podcast
*34:30.000- 34:36.100* :  in podcasting through the night from Iowa with my podcast buddies chatting about the caucus here.
*34:36.100- 34:40.720* :  We've got to have a talk with Eric Trump. How many more primaries you have to go through before
*34:41.240- 34:45.500* :  it's just obvious that he is the presumptive nominate. I'm certain it will be done by Super Tuesday.
