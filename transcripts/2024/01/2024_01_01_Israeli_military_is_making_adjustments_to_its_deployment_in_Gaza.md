*00:38.580- 00:39.020* :  Nothing.

*00:46.340- 00:50.740* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies
*00:50.740- 00:54.120* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:54.560- 00:57.120* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.120- 01:00.900* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*01:00.900- 01:02.480* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:38.820- 01:41.320* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:42.700- 01:45.220* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Monday, the 1st of January,
*01:45.220- 01:46.640* :  these are our main stories.
*01:46.720- 01:50.780* :  The Israeli military says it's begun to withdraw some troops from the Gaza Strip,
*01:51.120- 01:54.260* :  with plans for further withdrawals depending on the level of fighting.
*01:54.860- 01:57.820* :  The authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo say President
*01:57.820- 02:03.140* :  Felix Chisakadi has been re-elected for a second term with more than 70% of the vote.
*02:03.820- 02:07.500* :  Europe's longest-raining monarch, the Queen of Denmark, has announced that she will
*02:07.500- 02:08.920* :  abdicate later this month.
*02:11.020- 02:11.800* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:11.840- 02:15.400* :  the Queen of Denmark.
*02:16.380- 02:21.580* :  In time zones around the world, people count down and celebrate the new year, 2024.
*02:25.320- 02:30.520* :  The Israeli military says it's making adjustments to its deployment in the Gaza Strip,
*02:30.600- 02:33.980* :  as it anticipates a long war against Hamas.
*02:34.520- 02:38.700* :  A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces, Daniel Haggari, said he expected the
*02:38.700- 02:42.180* :  fighting to continue throughout the entire coming year.
*02:42.580- 02:47.440* :  And he said some troops, especially reserve units, could be withdrawn from the Gaza Strip
*02:47.660- 02:49.340* :  in preparation for further fighting.
*02:49.800- 02:55.560* :  These days, we are also adjusting the plan of forces deployment in Gaza and in the array of
*02:55.560- 03:00.000* :  reservists. Some of the reservists' soldiers will return to their families and their jobs
*03:00.000- 03:05.240* :  this week. This will allow a significant relief for the economy and will allow them to gather
*03:05.240- 03:09.580* :  strength ahead of the coming activities in the next year. The fighting will continue,
*03:09.580- 03:14.380* :  and we will need them. These adjustments are meant to ensure planning and preparation for
*03:14.380- 03:20.700* :  the rest of 2024. The IDF must plan ahead with the understanding that we will be required
*03:20.700- 03:24.940* :  for more missions and the continuation of the fighting all throughout this year.
*03:25.580- 03:30.420* :  A former UN Undersecretary for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O'Brien said he welcomed
*03:30.420- 03:36.160* :  anything which de-escalated the fighting, but thought this was no more than a tactical move.
*03:36.740- 03:42.220* :  I still think that the overriding concern happens to be, of course, the humanitarian and the
*03:42.540- 03:47.700* :  question of life. And whilst we welcome this, I don't think it will make a massive difference
*03:47.700- 03:52.440* :  as we think about celebrating going into the year around the rest of the world. I think it's
*03:52.500- 03:54.920* :  anything but a celebration in that part of the world, sadly.
*03:55.740- 03:59.840* :  In a separate development, the United States Navy says it's destroyed three small
*03:59.840- 04:05.160* :  Houthi boats in the Red Sea after the Iranian-backed rebels attempted to board a passing
*04:05.160- 04:10.820* :  container ship. Nearby U.S. warships sent attack helicopters after receiving a distress call
*04:10.820- 04:15.820* :  from the mask vessel off the coast of Yemen. The Houthis claimed their attacks are directed at
*04:15.820- 04:20.680* :  vessels linked to Israel in response to the war in Gaza. A senior member of the Israeli
*04:20.680- 04:25.960* :  Nesset Danny Denon told the BBC the attack showed that the war affected the whole of the
*04:25.960- 04:30.960* :  international community. Indeed, we have a plan and we have the capability to deal with the
*04:30.960- 04:37.680* :  hoodies, but we expect the international community to be involved on this issue because it's a threat
*04:37.680- 04:43.680* :  not only to Israel, but to the entire Western democracies. And I think what we said is at the
*04:43.680- 04:48.880* :  beginning that it's a fight against democracy. Not like you can see now. I heard more regarding
*04:48.880- 04:53.500* :  the escalating security problems in the Red Sea from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Shama Khalil.
*04:54.100- 05:01.540* :  We understand that four boats got extremely close to the Merce-Kangru vessel in the Red Sea,
*05:01.540- 05:09.020* :  four Houthi boats coming from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. They got within meters of the vessel
*05:09.020- 05:14.700* :  with the aim of actually getting on board. And this is when a U.S. warship got the distress call
*05:14.700- 05:20.860* :  from the vessel and was itself then attacked by the boats and sank three of them killing,
*05:20.860- 05:26.360* :  as we understand now, ten militants. The fourth boat fled the area. We also understand that
*05:26.620- 05:32.820* :  during the attack, the militants on the boats were attacking with mounted weapons and with small
*05:32.820- 05:38.120* :  arms. We now have a statement from the hoodies themselves. They were iterated and confirmed
*05:38.120- 05:44.160* :  their support for Gaza, vowing to continue targeting vessels. They claim our link to Israel.
*05:44.160- 05:50.060* :  But also confirming that ten group members, ten of their militants, were killed during the U.S.'s
*05:50.400- 05:54.420* :  response to the attack and saying in that statement, quote, that the U.S. is going to bear the
*05:54.420- 05:59.240* :  brunt of this or going to bear the consequences of this. Now, Shama, there are a number of U.S.
*05:59.240- 06:04.640* :  Navy vessels and Navy vessels from other countries patrolling in the Red Sea at the moment,
*06:04.640- 06:09.300* :  but it's very difficult for them, isn't it? Because the Houthi rebels are backed by Iran,
*06:09.300- 06:12.780* :  and they seem to have a number of different ways of attacking ships.
*06:13.160- 06:16.180* :  Well, exactly. I mean, if you look at this attack that we're looking at now, remember,
*06:16.180- 06:21.720* :  this is the second attack in 24 hours on the same vessel, the Merse Kangjoo. On Saturday,
*06:21.720- 06:26.900* :  it was targeted by two missiles that a U.S. warship shot down. They were coming from
*06:26.900- 06:33.240* :  Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. 24 hours later, they attempted another attack using four
*06:33.240- 06:38.580* :  boats, four small boats, again trying to come on board. If you look at video released by the Houthis
*06:38.580- 06:43.560* :  last month, for example, you'd see that militants had come off an helicopter on board of a ship,
*06:43.560- 06:48.100* :  a cargo ship, and were trying to attack or have attacked the crew there. So their capabilities
*06:48.100- 06:53.680* :  are quite wide. It is quite relentless what we've seen in the last month or so since November.
*06:53.680- 06:58.140* :  And if you look at a map, for example, of this area of the Red Sea, and especially that map,
*06:58.420- 07:04.540* :  Bebelmendab straight, it is quite concentrated, and the aim of it essentially is to suffocate
*07:04.540- 07:07.960* :  the shipping and the maritime activity in that area.
*07:08.620- 07:14.100* :  Shahmi Khalil in Jerusalem there. With the Israeli Foreign Minister Ali Cohen has said his
*07:14.100- 07:20.280* :  government is prepared to allow aid shipments to Gaza immediately within a proposed sea corridor
*07:20.280- 07:26.560* :  from Cyprus. Such a move would mark the first easing of the Israeli naval blockade imposed on
*07:26.560- 07:32.500* :  Gaza when Hamas militants took control there in 2007. More details from Lipika Palem.
*07:33.080- 07:37.380* :  Ali Cohen said that under the plan fast put forward by Cyprus last month,
*07:37.800- 07:42.820* :  vessels taking aid to Gaza would be checked for weapons by a joint European committee
*07:42.820- 07:48.920* :  and representatives from Israel at the port of Larnaca. Rather than offloading aid at Egyptian
*07:48.920- 07:55.000* :  or Israeli ports, the ships would then be ferried straight to the shores of Gaza. Britain and Greece
*07:55.000- 08:00.960* :  have previously expressed support for the Cypriot initiative, with the UK offering shallow bottom
*08:00.960- 08:07.340* :  to vessels to approach the Gaza coast. Mr Cohen's comments came as the UN's relief agency warned
*08:07.340- 08:13.820* :  that without immediate food supplies there was a risk of famine in Gaza. Julia Tumar is from Androa.
*08:14.280- 08:20.900* :  As the world comes down to the new year there's another countdown that's happening in Gaza and
*08:20.900- 08:28.560* :  that's the countdown against the risk of moving famine which could happen in the coming few weeks
*08:28.560- 08:35.020* :  if no more food supplies come into Gaza. Adequate food supplies. Israel has been carrying out
*08:35.020- 08:41.520* :  intense air strikes on the Almagazi and Al-Buret refugee camps in central Gaza. The Hamasran
*08:41.520- 08:48.020* :  Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 100 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 300 wounded in the
*08:48.020- 08:54.580* :  past 24 hours. Palestinian media reported that a former Palestinian authority minister had been
*08:54.580- 09:00.700* :  killed in an air strike on his home in the Almagazi camp. Yusuf Salama was a former minister of
*09:00.700- 09:06.560* :  religious affairs and had also served as an Imam at Al-Alaqsa Mosque in the old city of Jerusalem.
*09:07.340- 09:13.500* :  Gaza's health officials say the Israeli military campaign has already killed nearly 22,000 people.
*09:15.660- 09:21.780* :  China's leader Xi Jinping has reiterated his claim that it is inevitable that Taiwan will be
*09:21.780- 09:27.360* :  reunified with mainland China. Mr. Xi made the comments during his new year's address which
*09:27.360- 09:33.100* :  comes less than two weeks before a general election in the self-ruled island that Beijing considers
*09:33.100- 09:41.660* :  part of its own territory. The reunification of the Motherland is a historical inevitability.
*09:42.480- 09:47.380* :  compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose
*09:48.060- 09:51.740* :  and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
*09:52.540- 09:57.700* :  In their recent televised debate, Taiwan's three election candidates, who have different views on
*09:57.700- 10:03.420* :  how to deal with Beijing, argued whether peaceful coexistence with mainland China was possible.
*10:04.720- 10:09.760* :  The Russian President Vladimir Putin devoted much of his annual new year address to praising
*10:09.760- 10:11.640* :  Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.
*10:17.660- 10:25.840* :  On the front line of the fight for truth and justice, you are our heroes, our hearts are with you,
*10:26.320- 10:29.220* :  we are proud of you, we admire your courage.
*10:29.980- 10:34.740* :  Speaking from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin called on the Russian people to stay united and said Moscow
*10:34.740- 10:40.240* :  would never back down in the conflict. Analysts say his speech was a rallying cry just as some
*10:40.240- 10:43.860* :  poll suggest an increasing number of Russians want the conflict to end.
*10:44.160- 10:49.360* :  On Saturday night, Ukraine came under attack from Russian airstrikes again, mainly in the
*10:49.360- 10:55.060* :  eastern Harkiv region. Ukraine has disputed Russia's claim that it was targeting military targets
*10:55.060- 11:00.140* :  in its latest attack on the country, with Kiev claiming not a single one was hit.
*11:00.580- 11:03.380* :  Nikki Shiller spoke to our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse,
*11:03.940- 11:09.140* :  so it does seem to be a deadly aerial tit for tat as 2024 gets underway.
*11:09.760- 11:16.460* :  It really does and it's certainly not like for like with Russia always being able to mount
*11:16.460- 11:22.020* :  the larger attacks and this week has been no exception in the most deadliest of terms really.
*11:22.580- 11:27.580* :  In a week where we saw its biggest ever aerial bombardment, we saw Ukraine respond, then Russia
*11:28.360- 11:33.980* :  hit back and it seems the northeastern city of Harkiv over the past 48 hours has really
*11:34.740- 11:41.560* :  bore the brunt with several dozens of missiles landing in the city causing extensive damage to
*11:41.560- 11:47.740* :  medical buildings were told residential blocks including a hotel, popular among foreign journalists
*11:48.340- 11:56.320* :  are team with air only a few days ago. So I think this is a deadly tit for tat in the aerial
*11:56.320- 12:03.000* :  sense. It almost takes place in tandem with what goes on on the front line when you have Vladimir
*12:03.000- 12:08.200* :  Putin as you say saying he will never retreat I don't think anyone expected him to say otherwise
*12:08.200- 12:12.040* :  but you know there were fears Russia had been stockpiling missiles as we approached the
*12:12.040- 12:15.460* :  New Year celebrations but I think that moment has already arrived.
*12:15.460- 12:20.760* :  I'm interested because you talk to local Ukrainians every day people in the country
*12:21.160- 12:27.820* :  how have they taken this latest attack? Is it a case of sort of psychological warfare from the
*12:27.820- 12:32.640* :  Russians on them? It certainly is I mean it really does vary. I think we'll always
*12:32.640- 12:38.680* :  amazes you is when you watch people live with sirens sometimes you have to act on them they take
*12:38.680- 12:44.180* :  shelter they get the all clear and they carry on with their days and there are parts of the country
*12:44.180- 12:50.240* :  in the in the west in the north even with cherni hiv which still isn't immune from missile strikes
*12:50.240- 12:57.640* :  it was targeted only a few months ago. People in the main can live regular life in the sense of
*12:58.000- 13:02.180* :  there's been curfews every evening so you can't really go out and stay late but it changes
*13:02.960- 13:08.860* :  drastically the closer you get to the 700 mile long front line where people really are afraid
*13:08.860- 13:15.080* :  where people see a scale of death that they had never seen before and yet they choose to live
*13:15.460- 13:20.260* :  it remaining their homes in their words they'd rather die at home than as a refugee in a foreign
*13:20.260- 13:28.160* :  country. James Waterhouse in Ukraine. Queen Margaret of Denmark has unexpectedly used her new
*13:28.160- 13:34.420* :  years eve speech to announce she'll abdicate later this month. When Danes sat down to listen to
*13:34.420- 13:44.580* :  the Queen speech on television they weren't expecting this. On January 14th 2024 52 years after
*13:44.580- 13:50.500* :  succeeding my beloved father I will step down as the Queen of Denmark. I will pass on the throne
*13:50.500- 13:58.040* :  to my son Crown Prince Frederick. Loan tiles is a Danish journalist and writer in Copenhagen
*13:58.800- 14:03.620* :  people were really in shock. We were just expecting you know she gives a speech every year
*14:04.340- 14:10.080* :  and we were just expecting the same as usual and then all of a sudden it took a turn to say the
*14:10.080- 14:16.140* :  least it was an historical event because it's turned out to be her last new year speech ever after
*14:16.140- 14:21.920* :  52 years on the throne. It came completely out of the blue and then it didn't. I mean she's 83
*14:21.920- 14:27.960* :  years old now and she did mention during her speech that you know her body is starting to show
*14:27.960- 14:33.580* :  wear and tear after so many years in the job and she had her back operation earlier this year
*14:34.400- 14:39.300* :  so she felt it was the proper time. She has been immensely popular and she's really played a good
*14:39.520- 14:47.320* :  role in making the monarchy popular in Denmark. When she came to the throne about 40% of the population
*14:47.320- 14:54.080* :  supported the monarchy and as she leaves it's now over 70%. So that alone is a massive effort
*14:54.080- 15:00.340* :  and she's she's really very popular. She hasn't really done anything that has sort of put
*15:00.340- 15:04.960* :  out of the favor with the with the population. There was a little thing last year when she sort of
*15:04.960- 15:10.360* :  slimmed down the monarchy and that kind of came a little bit sudden of where she took away the
*15:10.360- 15:17.500* :  titles of the children of her second son Prince Joachim and people now think this was probably
*15:17.500- 15:23.480* :  some kind of preparation for the news that we've had today. Loan tiles a Danish journalist and writer
*15:23.480- 15:30.100* :  in Copenhagen. The Italian city of Venice has over 400 bridges more than 100 canals and millions
*15:30.100- 15:35.900* :  of visitors each year and that huge popularity has become a problem. The city has made many attempts
*15:35.900- 15:41.400* :  over the years to relieve the pressure on its narrow streets. Now new rules have been announced
*15:41.440- 15:46.260* :  that will limit large groups of tourists and loudspeakers. Madeline Drury has more.
*15:49.540- 15:54.620* :  Ah the familiar slightly grating sound of tourist groups shuffling through one of Europe's
*15:54.620- 16:00.180* :  most visited destinations but after a statement from the city's council on Saturday those
*16:00.180- 16:06.380* :  loudspeakers could be a thing of the past. The council said the amplified mics generate confusion
*16:06.380- 16:12.340* :  and disturbances and so it'll be banned from June. Tourist groups of more than 25 people will
*16:12.340- 16:17.680* :  not be allowed and there'll be no more stopping in narrow streets or in bridges. They didn't give
*16:17.680- 16:22.720* :  details on how that would be policed. The Leria Duflow is a campaigner for sustainable tourism
*16:22.720- 16:28.860* :  in the city. On any given day there are mucheries and visitors so that's more where the problem is
*16:29.000- 16:34.120* :  is that there are many people coming and they all go to the same places. Last year the number of
*16:34.120- 16:40.160* :  tourist beds across hotels and rented holiday homes exceeded the 49,000 people that live there.
*16:40.480- 16:44.240* :  For locals, the Leria says tourism here is a double-edged sword.
*16:44.460- 16:48.780* :  And when is everybody knows that the city depends on tourism? Currently,
*16:48.780- 16:54.860* :  the masterism has been such a major industry in the city for decades that it's
*16:55.140- 17:01.400* :  basically displaced virtually almost any other kind of trade. They have to imagine that we are in a
*17:01.400- 17:08.020* :  city where we have 20,000 people coming. You know, like we have to clean behind them. They're
*17:08.020- 17:12.660* :  using public transportation. All of that creates a lot of cost. There is being picked up by the local
*17:12.660- 17:17.820* :  community. It's estimated that tourism generates nearly two billion euros each year here,
*17:18.220- 17:25.860* :  but average rents rose by 6% between 2021 and 2022, which authorities say is pricing people out.
*17:27.440- 17:32.740* :  The UN Cultural Agency Yinesco is watching. Twice they have considered placing Venice on their
*17:32.740- 17:38.780* :  list of heritage sites in danger, and twice the city has escaped the list by introducing new rules.
*17:39.380- 17:43.920* :  With this weekend's announcement, Venice's status could be once again put under Yinesco's spotlight
*17:43.920- 17:51.200* :  when they next meet in September. Madeline Drury reporting. Still to come in Bangladesh.
*17:53.040- 17:59.280* :  I ran to the river bank and found bodies laying everywhere. I was at a loss. The unexpected
*17:59.280- 18:01.160* :  danger brought by climate change.

*18:59.160- 19:03.340* :  There's this massive landslide of myth and somewhere in there is the truth.

*19:14.040- 19:18.660* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Next to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*19:27.460- 19:31.900* :  This is the head of the Independent National Election Commission announcing the re-election
*19:31.900- 19:38.040* :  of the current president, Felix Chisegady. The vote took place early this month and there were widespread
*19:38.040- 19:44.020* :  logistical problems. Opposition leaders have called for protests and a rerun. I heard more
*19:44.020- 19:50.120* :  from Emory Macumeno, our correspondent in the DRC. Mr. Felix Chisegady has secured the
*19:50.120- 19:58.540* :  second term in office with 13 million out of the 18 million voters, which is a big majority,
*19:58.540- 20:06.100* :  72% of the total votes. But it was not a big surprise here because for the last nine days they
*20:06.100- 20:12.660* :  have been publishing partial results, polling station, polling station. So it was already known
*20:12.660- 20:19.860* :  that Chisegady had a huge advance from his rivals. Meanwhile Mr. Chisegady is going to be looking
*20:19.860- 20:25.560* :  forward to his second term in office. He faces huge challenges, doesn't he, particularly in the
*20:25.560- 20:30.060* :  east of the country? Yes, in the eastern part of the country, but particularly you have five
*20:30.060- 20:38.020* :  provinces in the eastern DRC. They have been ongoing conflicts between a myriad of armed groups
*20:38.740- 20:44.200* :  and the regal are clashing with the regular army. This is something that has generated seven
*20:44.200- 20:50.460* :  million internally displaced people. And he said that he is going, this is among his priorities to
*20:50.460- 20:56.440* :  tackle during his second term in office. But there is also a situation of food insecurity with
*20:56.440- 21:03.980* :  almost one-fourth of the population. That's about 24 million people who are living with food
*21:03.980- 21:10.440* :  insecurity. But you also have unemployment, which is high, especially among the youth.
*21:10.560- 21:17.080* :  The country is extremely rich with natural resources, cobalt, cotton, lithium, which are very
*21:17.080- 21:22.760* :  important for the energy transition. But the majority of the Congolese live with almost
*21:23.020- 21:29.600* :  $2.15, which is the poverty line. It does seem extraordinary. You've outlined the problems hunger,
*21:29.600- 21:37.380* :  unemployment, insecurity, and yet after a number of years in office, Mr. Chisekade still
*21:37.380- 21:44.000* :  got 72% of the vote. How do you explain that? Well, Congolese politics is very complex. You have
*21:44.760- 21:54.560* :  910 political parties and Mr. Chisekade has succeeded to somehow federate about 500 of them.
*21:54.740- 22:01.100* :  I mean, he has a very strong coalition in power, so his allies did campaign all over the
*22:01.100- 22:08.660* :  country promising that in his second term here is going to do his best. Emory Makumeno in the
*22:08.660- 22:13.100* :  Democratic Republic of Congo. When we talk about the problems associated with climate change,
*22:13.100- 22:17.760* :  it's usually droughts, floods, or bigger hurricanes. But what about lightning strikes?
*22:17.820- 22:23.780* :  They are becoming far more frequent in Bangladesh. The UN says more than 300 people die in the
*22:23.780- 22:29.200* :  country every year from such events. A correspondent Rajini Vajanathan has been speaking to the
*22:29.200- 22:36.040* :  families of some victims. It was a bright and sunny day when Abdullah went to harvest rice
*22:36.160- 22:42.740* :  near his home in South Kira in Bangladesh, as he did every day. By late afternoon, a heavy storm
*22:42.740- 22:50.220* :  arrived, as it intensified, a thunderbolt struck Abdullah. Rahana explained what happened.
*22:52.680- 22:57.880* :  My husband felt a year when the lightning hit him. Some other farmers brought him to this
*22:57.880- 23:09.680* :  roadside shop, by then he was dead. Rahana tells me that she's terrified. Every time she sees a
*23:09.680- 23:16.300* :  cloud in the sky. For her, it's a grief so unusual. It's impossible to understand.
*23:21.700- 23:26.280* :  Lightning is a big killer in Bangladesh, claiming more lives annually than floods.
*23:28.940- 23:34.800* :  Farmers make up the largest number of such deaths, working in the open with little cover or
*23:34.800- 23:40.580* :  protection. They're often the most vulnerable. The government says extreme storms due to global
*23:40.580- 23:47.240* :  warming have led to a rise in fatal lightning strikes over the years. At the other end of the
*23:47.240- 23:56.320* :  country, a short drive from the capital is where we meet Mamoon. The 21-year-old thought he'd
*23:56.320- 24:03.400* :  be celebrating his wedding day two years ago. Instead, he was arranging funerals. As his family made
*24:03.400- 24:09.480* :  their way to the ceremony, a storm struck. As they took shelter under a tin shed, they were hit
*24:16.420- 24:21.520* :  by lightning. I ran to the riverbank and found bodies lying everywhere. I was at a loss.
*24:22.320- 24:27.620* :  I couldn't even decide who to go to first. All the dead and injured were my clothes relatives.
*24:28.920- 24:32.900* :  When I found my father's body, I simply burst into tears.
*24:35.640- 24:39.860* :  There are efforts in Bangladesh to do more to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning.
*24:40.600- 24:45.220* :  Activists say more tall trees need to be planted to absorb the impact of strikes,
*24:45.220- 24:51.300* :  especially in remote areas, which have borne the brunt of deforestation. They also want better
*24:51.300- 24:58.620* :  early warning systems and more lightning shelters to be built. Back at the field where Abdullah
*24:58.620- 25:06.760* :  died, we meet Rippon, a farmer who was with him that day. There was a big loud sound and then
*25:06.760- 25:13.620* :  I saw lots of flashing lights. It was as if a disk of fire had fallen on us. I felt a
*25:13.620- 25:18.760* :  great electric shock and fell to the ground. Rippon is terrified to work in the open,
*25:18.760- 25:25.060* :  but here, and in many impoverished agricultural areas, farming is the only source of income.
*25:25.880- 25:31.680* :  Rippon hopes more can be done to protect people like him, even if it's too late for Abdullah.
*25:48.860- 25:55.100* :  But was accused by opponents of backing authoritarian leaders. He also made accusations against
*25:55.100- 25:59.420* :  the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. David Bamford looks back at his life.
*26:00.180- 26:05.280* :  John Pilger began his career in Australia, but moved to Britain in his early 20s.
*26:05.580- 26:10.520* :  He first became prominent with his 1970s documentary film The Quiet Mutiny,
*26:10.800- 26:16.580* :  made during one of his visits to Vietnam. He helped expose the extent of the Cambodia genocide
*26:16.580- 26:21.900* :  under the pole pot regime and investigated the thalidomide birth defects scandal.
*26:22.560- 26:29.060* :  But critics labelled his campaigning style sensationalist. In 1990, he denied exploiting
*26:29.060- 26:34.700* :  the emotional heartache in his stories. What I've done is I've put the heartache as he put it
*26:34.700- 26:41.840* :  in a political context. I've tried to explain why hearts ache. I've tried to explain why people
*26:45.260- 26:51.480* :  are caught up in wars. John Pilger later called Tony Blair a war criminal over Britain's involvement
*26:51.480- 26:58.560* :  in the 2003 war in Iraq. He often described the mainstream media as deceitful. In recent years,
*26:58.560- 27:04.020* :  he campaigned for the release of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, even putting up his bail
*27:04.020- 27:10.020* :  money. David Bamford. As we enter a new year, what can we expect over the next 12 months,
*27:10.140- 27:15.180* :  just before the war in Gaza, a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies
*27:15.700- 27:20.580* :  documented 183 conflicts around the world, the highest in more than three decades.
*27:20.700- 27:25.720* :  There's also the war between Russia and Ukraine. But let's publicize conflicts
*27:25.720- 27:30.940* :  arranging in Africa. In Sudan, since April, the conflict has claimed thousands of lives and
*27:30.940- 27:37.440* :  created six million refugees. In Asia, the conflict in Myanmar seems to be intensifying. In the
*27:37.440- 27:42.880* :  Indo-Pacific military tensions are high in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.
*27:43.320- 27:46.320* :  Jillian Warraka spoke to the BBC's chief international correspondent,
*27:46.320- 27:49.660* :  Leigh's DeSette, and asked her for her thoughts on 2024.
*27:50.720- 27:54.480* :  It's going to be the year with the highest number of elections ever in history.
*27:55.500- 27:59.240* :  And yet, the international Institute of Strategic Studies, even before the war in Gaza,
*27:59.800- 28:06.640* :  said that never has the world seen so many wars. And the wars that we see now are becoming
*28:06.640- 28:11.840* :  forever wars. They become ever more brutal. You know, back we talk about
*28:11.840- 28:17.380* :  First World War Trenches in the Ukraine War. After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*28:17.420- 28:23.760* :  we look at Gaza. The word, when I flew to Israel right after that, we kept using every day,
*28:23.820- 28:28.680* :  sometimes every hour, the word unprecedented, never seen this many hostages taken,
*28:29.020- 28:34.840* :  never seen this many deaths of Israelis in the single day, never seen this kind of devastation
*28:34.840- 28:40.640* :  and bloodshed in Gaza for a people who have lived more with a generation which has lived more
*28:40.640- 28:45.660* :  with war than with peace. We use this word apocalyptic. Gaza is apocalyptic where people are
*28:46.020- 28:50.540* :  fighting, been reduced to fighting over a piece of bread where the nightmare scenario
*28:51.080- 28:57.520* :  is a huge stampede into Egypt because they have nowhere else to go. So we meet, is it those words
*28:57.520- 29:02.560* :  that word we'd like to use as journalists about an inflection point? We have to look for the
*29:02.560- 29:06.700* :  light in the dark and always fall back on that Cold War Gramscian, you know, the optimism of the
*29:06.700- 29:12.180* :  well and the pessimism of the intellect because we have to continue to hope that there is a way
*29:12.180- 29:16.960* :  out of this. And there are voices for peace in all of these contexts aren't there and they are
*29:16.960- 29:23.200* :  heard but they don't have the influence to actually change the political activities just now.
*29:23.340- 29:28.120* :  You know, it's not just the voices for peace and they're important. There are the good reasons
*29:28.920- 29:35.320* :  for peace and for those who are looking for light in this dark, there was a hope that out of this
*29:35.320- 29:41.280* :  terrible terrible terrible cataclysm of this Israel Gaza war that people could be pushed to realize
*29:41.280- 29:45.680* :  that to look at an alternative, look at a different way and that is why when you hear
*29:45.680- 29:52.460* :  even the families whose loved ones have been taken hostage in Gaza saying violence
*29:52.460- 29:59.840* :  gets violence. This is madness. We have to find another way forward. But as always in these
*29:59.840- 30:05.420* :  in these wars, and sadly it is the case in the in the Israel Gaza war, particularly on the
*30:05.420- 30:11.360* :  Israeli side, but not exclusively, that there are more who have an interest in the war than have an
*30:11.360- 30:19.540* :  interest in the peace. And until that is that is overcome. There was this comfort for for the West
*30:19.600- 30:25.960* :  for NATO powers coming out of the messiness of Afghanistan, a cold war mannequin vision of the
*30:25.960- 30:32.480* :  world, the dark and the light, Russia against Ukraine, good versus evil as they sought. But there
*30:32.480- 30:39.160* :  is to use the moral messiness of Gaza, moral messiness, many many actors involved. There is no
*30:39.160- 30:44.460* :  there is no clarity just a very conscious and huge huge suffering. And just throwing forward and
*30:44.460- 30:49.580* :  we mentioned elections. And of course, if there is one election in the next 11 months, I use the
*30:49.760- 30:55.960* :  11 specifically that is going to matter so much more arguably than all the others. It's the American
*30:55.960- 31:02.380* :  election unprecedented again because of what is going on now to get to November. That could have
*31:02.380- 31:07.360* :  an extraordinary bearing on almost all of this. I'm in a club maybe with a member of one that
*31:07.360- 31:12.120* :  believes everyone in the world should vote in American elections, including myself a Canadian.
*31:12.840- 31:17.640* :  We are all impacted by it. And I have to say as a Canadian, I have resisted because we live in
*31:17.640- 31:24.300* :  the shadow of the United States. But it never ceases to amaze me that for all of the talk of
*31:24.720- 31:30.560* :  America's descent as a superpower, America retreating from the world. Look at the Israel Gaza war.
*31:30.560- 31:34.600* :  You know, when I sat down with some Arab foreign ministers in private and for all the criticism
*31:34.600- 31:38.460* :  of the United States and public, they say Biden's got to come up with a plan. They've got to
*31:38.740- 31:43.660* :  Biden's got to do it. He's the only one can can do it in particular because he's seen as the
*31:43.660- 31:49.540* :  only one America which can bring Israel to the table. The BBC's chief international correspondent
*31:49.540- 31:55.220* :  leads to set. As we recall this podcast, many people around the world have been seeing in the new
*31:55.220- 32:00.760* :  year, many with large fireworks displays, of course, hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong harbor
*32:00.760- 32:07.540* :  watched a spectacular musical parotechnic event called New Year New Legend. In Beijing, there was
*32:07.540- 32:14.240* :  a countdown at Capitol Steel Park before bells rang out. This was London by the banks of the river
*32:14.240- 32:19.540* :  Thames a short time ago. It's estimated a hundred thousand people bought tickets to see the fireworks
*32:36.580- 32:40.940* :  display. Harry Bligh has been finding out more about the celebrations as the time zones around
*32:40.940- 32:47.100* :  the world changed to the first day of 2024. The first place to celebrate for New Year was the
*32:47.100- 32:53.040* :  Atoll of Christmas, known as Christmas Island, part of the Republic of Kiribats. Located in the
*32:53.040- 32:59.100* :  Pacific Ocean, it's 14 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time and season the New Year before anyone else.
*33:01.540- 33:05.080* :  One hour behind them at GMT plus 13 is New Zealand.
*33:10.940- 33:14.360* :  The city of Auckland, celebrating the New Year with a fireworks display.
*33:17.240- 33:30.340* :  Then Tokyo, which marks the occasion with the ringing of bells at Buddhist temples
*33:30.340- 33:36.340* :  all over the country, which ring out a total of 108 times, based on the belief that it will
*33:36.340- 33:42.660* :  rid the sins of the passing year. In South Korea, there's also the tolling of a bell and central
*33:42.660- 33:46.740* :  soul, running from 11 p.m. local time until warm in the morning.
*33:51.500- 33:56.580* :  The ringing of this bell bids farewell to the old year and expresses hope and happiness for the
*34:06.460- 34:11.400* :  year to come. Then in Taipei, there are fireworks launched off the tallest building, the 101
*34:11.400- 34:14.640* :  tower, with some spectators watching from Taiga Mountain.
*34:18.140- 34:21.660* :  At the same time, Sydney in Australia, according to the local authorities,
*34:22.200- 34:24.460* :  it's the New Year's Eve capital of the world.
*34:27.720- 34:32.060* :  With its traditional firework display at the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge,
*34:32.700- 34:38.080* :  organisers say more than 75,000 pyrotechnic effects exploded at midnight.
*34:40.340- 34:42.440* :  Harry Blie reporting for us.
