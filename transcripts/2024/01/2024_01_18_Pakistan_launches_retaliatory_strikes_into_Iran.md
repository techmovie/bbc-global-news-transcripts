*01:48.440- 01:53.240* :  I'm Janet Jalail and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 18th of January, these are our main
*01:53.240- 01:53.780* :  stories.
*01:54.540- 01:59.940* :  Pakistan has carried out targeted strikes against what it calls terrorist hideouts in Iran two
*01:59.940- 02:03.800* :  days after similar Iranian air strikes on Pakistani soil.
*02:04.640- 02:08.940* :  Israeli forces are continuing their assault on Khan Unis in southern Gaza with fierce
*02:08.940- 02:12.800* :  fighting now close to the biggest hospital still operating in the territory.
*02:13.720- 02:19.600* :  A court in Thailand has sent its demand to 50 years in prison for social media posts deemed
*02:19.600- 02:21.540* :  insulting to the country's monarchy.
*02:24.320- 02:30.000* :  Also in this podcast, the winner of a prestigious literary award in Japan reveals that part of
*02:30.000- 02:33.360* :  it was written by the chatbot GPT.
*02:33.360- 02:35.180* :  Should she give the prize back?
*02:40.280- 02:45.680* :  In what seems to be a tit for tat exchange, Pakistan has carried out a series of deadly
*02:45.680- 02:47.440* :  military strikes on Iran.
*02:48.100- 02:52.300* :  Iran has strongly condemned the attacks which it said had killed at least nine people.
*02:53.120- 02:57.440* :  This comes two days after Iran itself carried out cross-border missile strikes.
*02:57.900- 03:01.860* :  Each side has accused the other of killing children during their attacks.
*03:02.600- 03:05.560* :  Pakistan's military response follows diplomatic protests.
*03:06.200- 03:11.360* :  On Wednesday, Islamabad recalled its ambassador from Tehran and blocked Iran's envoy from
*03:11.360- 03:13.000* :  returning to his post in Pakistan.
*03:14.040- 03:18.820* :  In similar language that used by Tehran after its attacks, a Pakistani foreign ministry
*03:18.820- 03:25.220* :  spokeswoman Mumta Zara Baluch insisted her country was not targeting Iran, but terrorist
*03:25.220- 03:26.720* :  groups operating there.
*03:27.160- 03:33.560* :  Pakistan undertook a series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military
*03:33.560- 03:40.340* :  strikes against terrorist high doubts in Sistana Baluchistan province of Iran.
*03:41.180- 03:44.880* :  A number of terrorists were killed during the intelligence-based operation.
*03:45.580- 03:50.840* :  This morning's action was taken in light of credible intelligence of impending large-scale
*03:50.840- 03:54.900* :  terrorist activities against Pakistan by these terrorists.
*03:55.700- 04:00.520* :  I also corresponded to Islamabad, Caroline Davies, where the Pakistan strikes on Iran were
*04:00.520- 04:03.920* :  a one-off tit for tat or part of an escalating crisis.
*04:04.700- 04:05.860* :  That is going to be the big question.
*04:05.900- 04:07.020* :  What does Iran do next?
*04:07.040- 04:11.760* :  Looking at a lot of the language here, there has been real mirroring between what Pakistan
*04:11.760- 04:13.400* :  has said and what Iran has said.
*04:13.420- 04:18.460* :  As you say, this all started when Iran launched an attack and then admitted to launching an
*04:18.460- 04:22.400* :  attack on militants inside Pakistan's borders.
*04:23.140- 04:27.820* :  Now, this has been an ongoing point of disagreement between Pakistan and Iran, both side accused
*04:27.820- 04:32.700* :  the other of harboring terrorist groups that then come across the border, launch attacks
*04:32.700- 04:37.100* :  inside the country and then are able to flee to the other side of the border, which makes
*04:37.100- 04:41.360* :  it very difficult for that country to then follow and try to get any form of justice
*04:41.680- 04:42.780* :  for what has just happened.
*04:43.340- 04:45.000* :  So that is the backdrop to all of this.
*04:45.740- 04:49.580* :  As well, I think it's important to understand that Iran has in the course of the last few
*04:49.580- 04:54.760* :  days also launched attacks that have hit inside other countries as well, inside Syria, inside
*04:54.760- 04:57.000* :  Iraq and now inside Pakistan.
*04:57.760- 05:02.880* :  That seems to be that Iran is trying to show this display of strength of force, saying
*05:02.880- 05:07.420* :  that anything that it considers, any group it considers to be a threat, it will target.
*05:08.020- 05:14.700* :  Now, the relationship normally between Pakistan and Iran is normally fairly cordial and Pakistan
*05:14.700- 05:20.320* :  reacted with real condemnation when Iran launched these attacks on Tuesday.
*05:20.820- 05:27.280* :  As you say, they initially repelled and asked the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan not to come
*05:27.280- 05:31.500* :  back to the country, but then we saw this military action overnight.
*05:31.500- 05:36.300* :  Now, interestingly, Pakistan has said this is because they thought that there was going
*05:36.300- 05:41.540* :  to be an imminent terrorist attack organized by these militants inside Iran.
*05:41.540- 05:47.060* :  Now, most analysts are saying that is not very credible because, of course, the context
*05:47.060- 05:47.960* :  in which this has happened.
*05:48.420- 05:52.740* :  Both sides are still trying to create this language talking about militant groups, not the
*05:52.740- 05:53.300* :  other country.
*05:53.780- 05:57.520* :  Caroline, do you think there's an element of domestic politics to play here because there
*05:57.520- 05:59.480* :  are elections coming up quite soon in Pakistan?
*06:00.200- 06:04.660* :  There are elections coming up in Pakistan and at the same time, Pakistan's military,
*06:04.660- 06:09.820* :  its popularity has taken a real battering in the course of the last year or so.
*06:10.120- 06:15.040* :  Many people are incredibly critical inside Pakistan of the way that they see that the establishment,
*06:15.040- 06:19.760* :  which is the shorthand term here for Pakistan's military and intelligence services, the way
*06:19.760- 06:25.280* :  that they have reacted to Imran Khan and his party, Imran Khan, of course, is still in
*06:25.280- 06:26.460* :  prison at the moment.
*06:26.960- 06:28.440* :  Their popularity is pretty low.
*06:28.780- 06:34.200* :  There may be a suggestion that this might give the military here in Pakistan a bit of a
*06:34.200- 06:35.140* :  boost of popularity.
*06:35.140- 06:40.200* :  We don't know whether or not that's anything to do with why this attack has now happened,
*06:40.720- 06:44.120* :  and we also don't know how long lived that boost might be.
*06:44.600- 06:49.120* :  Our Pakistan correspondent Caroline Davies, more than 100 days after her massive
*06:49.120- 06:54.020* :  attack on Israel, the Israeli military is continuing to rain down bombs on Gaza as part
*06:54.020- 06:56.180* :  of its campaign to eradicate the group.
*06:56.840- 07:01.060* :  Israeli soldiers are engaged in a fierce assault on the southern city of Khan Unis,
*07:01.440- 07:06.180* :  with fighting now close to the biggest hospital still operating in the territory Al-Nasa.
*07:06.800- 07:10.380* :  Thousands of displaced civilians who have taken shelter there are reported to have fled
*07:10.380- 07:10.860* :  in panic.
*07:11.880- 07:15.860* :  Meanwhile, there's no confirmation on whether medicines brought into Gaza for the hostages
*07:15.860- 07:20.760* :  being held there, as part of a deal broken by Qatar and France, have been given to their
*07:20.760- 07:24.140* :  intended recipients, some of whom have chronic illnesses.
*07:25.080- 07:30.080* :  A senior member of Hamas said that for every box of medicine, earmarked for the hostages,
*07:30.440- 07:33.280* :  a thousand boxes would be delivered to Gaza residents.
*07:33.920- 07:39.920* :  The deal was also supposed to see an increase in aid for Gaza's 85% of whom have been displaced.
*07:40.200- 07:45.360* :  A spokesperson for the UN's World Food Programme Ab-e-Atefa told the BBC that help couldn't
*07:45.360- 07:46.380* :  come soon enough.
*07:47.040- 07:50.420* :  The situation for the last few weeks has been very difficult.
*07:50.500- 07:52.420* :  Everyone in Gaza is hungry.
*07:52.420- 07:54.580* :  Each day is a desperate search for food.
*07:54.580- 07:56.900* :  I think the bombardments are non-stop.
*07:57.560- 08:04.080* :  And with our latest data, every day passes the risk of famine increases because the conflict
*08:04.080- 08:09.120* :  limits the delivery of the life-saving humanitarian assistance to most people in need.
*08:09.640- 08:16.160* :  So after 100 days, three agencies have called for the lifting of old barriers and the restrictions
*08:16.160- 08:19.860* :  on aid delivery to be lifted to and within Gaza.
*08:20.440- 08:25.540* :  The Israeli President Isaac Herzog defended Israel's actions and said his country had been
*08:25.540- 08:27.060* :  left with no choice.
*08:27.820- 08:32.600* :  I'm not shying away from the human tragedy in Gaza, and you want to know something?
*08:33.240- 08:33.740* :  We care.
*08:34.620- 08:35.160* :  We care.
*08:35.900- 08:36.760* :  We bought it.
*08:37.220- 08:41.680* :  It is pain for us that our neighbors are suffering so much.
*08:42.380- 08:50.000* :  But how else can we defend ourselves if our enemies decided to entrench themselves in an
*08:50.000- 08:53.120* :  infrastructure of tell of unbelievable size?
*08:54.040- 08:58.320* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Joe Flotto, told us more about the deal to bring medicines
*08:58.320- 09:00.600* :  and increased aid into Gaza.
*09:01.240- 09:05.880* :  This was a deal that was announced somewhat prematurely last week by the Israeli government
*09:05.880- 09:08.660* :  and then confirmed a couple of nights ago by the Qataris.
*09:09.180- 09:16.200* :  We know that these medicines have now entered the Gaza Strip and alongside, as you mentioned,
*09:16.840- 09:22.800* :  the medicines for the Israeli hostages, there will be a thousand boxes of medicines for
*09:22.800- 09:24.100* :  Palestinian cases.
*09:24.760- 09:30.280* :  We obviously don't know and have no way of verifying whether those medicines will get to
*09:30.280- 09:30.840* :  the hostages.
*09:30.840- 09:34.880* :  The Israeli President, who is speaking at the Davos economic forum, has said that he
*09:35.520- 09:38.080* :  sincerely hopes and prays that they will get there.
*09:38.220- 09:45.520* :  We know that there are about 100 and 5 Israeli hostages that are believed to still be alive
*09:46.720- 09:47.460* :  inside Gaza.
*09:47.460- 09:50.920* :  And that's a mix of civilians and some soldiers who were taken.
*09:50.920- 09:57.160* :  Some of them are very elderly and about half of them are believed to be in need of medication.
*09:58.000- 10:02.460* :  And this has been something that has been troubling the Israeli families of the hostages
*10:02.480- 10:03.220* :  for some time.
*10:03.260- 10:09.500* :  They've been appealing to the Red Cross, the ICRC, and have been complaining that they haven't
*10:09.500- 10:10.800* :  managed to get medicines to them.
*10:10.820- 10:17.360* :  So this deal very much is there to reassure the families to try and keep these hostages
*10:17.360- 10:23.360* :  healthy, but also I imagine it will be a sign to the hostages themselves that their cases
*10:23.360- 10:24.180* :  haven't been forgotten.
*10:24.180- 10:29.540* :  In the meantime, no real sign of a breakthrough for a ceasefire deal that would include the
*10:29.540- 10:35.420* :  release of those hostages, but at least this is some progress in terms of diplomacy, and
*10:35.420- 10:36.740* :  we haven't seen that for a few weeks.
*10:37.080- 10:39.580* :  Meanwhile, the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues.
*10:40.540- 10:45.160* :  The military operation is supposed to be moving into a less intense phase, but it doesn't
*10:45.160- 10:50.600* :  feel that way to the citizens and the displaced people who are in Khan units at the moment.
*10:50.600- 10:55.320* :  The fighting is very close to the centre of that city, and people are therefore moving
*10:55.380- 10:59.800* :  a few kilometres further south to the border town of Rafa, which is right on the Egyptian
*10:59.800- 11:00.160* :  border.
*11:00.380- 11:07.120* :  That town has now been swollen at the UN estimating that about 1.4 million people who are moving
*11:07.120- 11:13.260* :  to the bottom end of the Gaza Strip and the concern now is that the one town Rafa that
*11:13.260- 11:19.780* :  hasn't seen a major military assault may be in line for the same treatment, and that
*11:19.780- 11:24.780* :  would have catastrophic consequences for those displaced people, but also would necessarily
*11:24.780- 11:30.320* :  suspend all aid shipments into Gaza, because that's the route, and that's the distribution
*11:30.320- 11:34.340* :  node for all that aid right at the bottom of the Gaza Strip.
*11:35.040- 11:36.480* :  Joe Fleto in Jerusalem.
*11:37.280- 11:41.340* :  In the biggest corruption scandal in Singapore of recent times, the transport minister,
*11:41.420- 11:46.180* :  S. Iswaren, has resigned after appearing in court to face multiple charges.
*11:46.760- 11:52.240* :  He pleaded not guilty to 27 alleged offences, including obstructing the course of justice.
*11:52.600- 11:57.400* :  He's accused of obtaining tickets to the Singapore Formula One Grand Prix, as well as two football
*11:57.400- 12:00.340* :  matches and shows in Britain from a property tycoon.
*12:00.760- 12:03.900* :  With more, he is our Singapore Business Reporter, Mariko Oy.
*12:04.500- 12:09.600* :  When Mr Swaren and property tycoon Onsen Ben were arrested back in July last year, it
*12:09.600- 12:14.680* :  truly shocked the city-state, because Singapore does have a reputation for clean governance,
*12:15.160- 12:19.140* :  and this is the biggest political scandal to hit the country in almost four decades.
*12:19.620- 12:25.140* :  Now, the two men played key roles in bringing the Grand Prix to Singapore in 2008, but Mr
*12:25.140- 12:30.020* :  Swaren has now been given 27 charges, including two for corruption.
*12:30.440- 12:35.880* :  He's allegedly accepted some tickets to concerts and the Grand Prix, as well as a free flight.
*12:35.980- 12:41.940* :  He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, but he has just handed in his resignation.
*12:42.600- 12:47.260* :  And in accepting his resignation, Prime Minister Leishan Long said, we must uphold the
*12:47.260- 12:50.460* :  integrity of the party and the government.
*12:50.460- 12:55.720* :  But actually, this is just the latest in a series of scandals that hit the ruling party.
*12:55.720- 13:01.080* :  There were extramarital affairs, and ministers accused of renting bungalows much cheaper
*13:01.080- 13:02.100* :  than the market rate.
*13:02.140- 13:08.640* :  And all these incidents have shaken Singaporeans trust in the ruling party, the PAP, which
*13:08.640- 13:11.880* :  has ruled Singapore since its independence in 1965.
*13:12.520- 13:17.760* :  But it's also raised a question of inequality, because Singapore's MPs are among the best
*13:17.760- 13:18.640* :  paid in the world.
*13:19.040- 13:25.280* :  Lawmakers get $12,000 a month, while ministers get $35,000 a month.
*13:25.680- 13:27.580* :  That's aimed at preventing corruption.
*13:27.940- 13:34.180* :  Now, Mr Swaren was getting a reduced salary of just over $6,000 a month, but he has announced
*13:34.180- 13:38.340* :  this morning that he will be returning all the money he's earned since the investigation
*13:38.340- 13:38.860* :  started.
*13:39.520- 13:46.360* :  Marika Oy in Singapore, a man in Thailand has been sentenced to 50 years in prison for insulting
*13:46.360- 13:47.000* :  the monarchy.
*13:47.000- 13:50.920* :  It's thought to be the longest sentence ever handed down for the offense.
*13:51.540- 13:56.740* :  Mon Con Tirokot, a pro-democracy activist, was convicted after posting comments on Facebook.
*13:57.400- 14:02.480* :  Hundreds of people have been prosecuted in Thailand under strict laws that prevent criticism
*14:02.480- 14:03.680* :  of the Thai King.
*14:03.700- 14:06.900* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent, Jonathan Head, reports.
*14:07.820- 14:13.520* :  The land now has an elected civilian government for the first time in ten years, but the much
*14:13.520- 14:18.980* :  criticised Les Majesty Law, criminalising any negative comment about the monarchy, is still
*14:18.980- 14:20.060* :  in full swing.
*14:20.760- 14:26.200* :  The 30-year-old clothing vendor has just received the longest sentence ever imposed under the
*14:26.200- 14:32.740* :  law after an appeal court decided to increase his original 28-year term to 50 years, and
*14:32.740- 14:37.420* :  the judge said he'd already reduced that by a third because of the defendant's cooperative
*14:38.020- 14:38.040* :  behaviour.
*14:38.740- 14:43.700* :  The law was briefly suspended at the start of the reign of King Wacha Longhorn, but has
*14:43.700- 14:49.600* :  been revived and used extensively since the outbreak of unprecedented student-led protests
*14:49.600- 14:53.540* :  three years ago, which called for sweeping reforms to the monarchy.
*14:54.340- 14:58.320* :  Details of what prompted such a harsh sentence are not being published.
*14:58.820- 15:03.760* :  The judge referred to multiple comments on Facebook, and Thai courts typically pile
*15:03.760- 15:06.940* :  on additional convictions for each individual post.
*15:07.520- 15:12.400* :  Later this month, the Constitutional Court will rule on whether to dissolve move forward,
*15:12.880- 15:17.680* :  the youthful party which won the most votes in last year's general election, over its
*15:17.680- 15:23.340* :  call to amend the Les Majesty Law, which some Thai Conservatives argue amounts to an attempt
*15:23.340- 15:26.220* :  to overthrow the entire political order.
*15:28.720- 15:33.280* :  A U.S. spacecraft, which it was hoped would make the first American landing on the moon
*15:33.280- 15:37.860* :  in more than 50 years, is heading back to Earth after developing a fault.
*15:38.380- 15:43.480* :  The U.S. company AstroBotic says its Paragrin spacecraft will be redirected to ensure it
*15:43.560- 15:44.780* :  crashes into the sea.
*15:45.300- 15:49.080* :  The lander suffered a few leaks soon after its launch last week.
*15:49.080- 15:51.720* :  Here's our science correspondent Jonathan Amos.
*15:52.420- 15:57.180* :  AstroBotic's Paragrin lander was in trouble almost as soon as it launched, a breach and
*15:57.180- 16:00.060* :  a propellant tank made the spacecraft difficult to control.
*16:00.680- 16:03.060* :  It certainly ruled out any attempt at a lunar landing.
*16:03.720- 16:08.200* :  The 10 days since have been spent testing the spaceworthiness of other systems, including
*16:08.200- 16:10.360* :  a suite of NASA scientific instruments.
*16:11.100- 16:15.800* :  Engineers don't want to leave debris in orbit, and will now command Paragrin to make a fiery
*16:15.800- 16:20.580* :  plunge into the Earth's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific, far from any population.
*16:21.200- 16:25.440* :  The craft was hoping to make the first ever landing on the moon by a private company,
*16:25.460- 16:28.700* :  the achievement of this feat will have to wait a little longer.
*16:29.720- 16:34.740* :  Jonathan Amos, well, despite the involvement of the private sector, space exploration still
*16:34.740- 16:36.960* :  remains a very expensive endeavor.
*16:37.600- 16:39.900* :  So why are commercial companies getting involved?
*16:39.980- 16:43.380* :  Professor Catherine Hamons is a British astrophysicist.
*16:43.780- 16:49.420* :  We have a space, outer space treaty that restricts people from claiming territory, but there's
*16:49.420- 16:50.400* :  nothing about mining.
*16:50.400- 16:54.860* :  In principle, there are lots of precious metals on the moon that could be essential for,
*16:54.860- 16:57.360* :  you know, your smartphone and things like that.
*16:57.760- 17:01.500* :  So there is commercial interest in going there.
*17:01.880- 17:06.820* :  Controversially, the Paragrin mission also contained human remains that were going to the
*17:08.440- 17:08.460* :  moon.
*17:08.460- 17:13.100* :  So there's another sort of human aspect there which makes scientists feel somewhat uncomfortable,
*17:14.360- 17:19.660* :  but it's something that maybe we have to embrace if we want to benefit from the cheaper
*17:20.360- 17:25.240* :  costs of launching these scientific experiments by collaborating with the commercial sector.
*17:25.420- 17:33.140* :  We don't have a good legal framework for space and internationally we need to discuss this
*17:33.320- 17:39.200* :  and do it quickly because the commercial sector is moving much faster than international
*17:39.200- 17:40.560* :  law can cope.
*17:40.940- 17:44.580* :  There's also the risk factor, you know, musk is famous for saying if things aren't failing,
*17:44.580- 17:49.420* :  you're not innovating enough, which is the complete opposite from the National Space
*17:49.420- 17:51.540* :  Agency's where missions do not fail.
*17:51.940- 17:56.520* :  So these are new worlds, but it's one that we are willing to embrace because it allows
*17:56.520- 17:58.140* :  us to do even more science.
*17:59.100- 18:00.580* :  Professor Catherine Hamons.
*18:01.260- 18:05.280* :  Some of the wealthiest people in the world have gathered in Davos and Switzerland for the
*18:05.320- 18:07.020* :  annual world economic forum.
*18:07.640- 18:12.380* :  Many are critical of the Davos meeting, which sees the super rich jetting into the Glitsey
*18:12.380- 18:15.040* :  Alpine resort to talk about the global economy.
*18:15.700- 18:20.360* :  But this year, a large number of the multi-millionaires attending have come up with a surprising
*18:20.360- 18:22.440* :  solution to reducing poverty.
*18:23.180- 18:27.600* :  They're demanding to be taxed more as Stephanie Prentice explains.
*18:28.420- 18:33.680* :  So this is an open letter and it was signed by 250 millionaires and billionaires and they're
*18:33.680- 18:36.620* :  asking even begging to be taxed more.
*18:37.100- 18:41.640* :  So on this list, there's people from 17 countries, including the Disney Air, Abigail Disney,
*18:42.120- 18:45.980* :  Larry Rockefeller, the US Air, and the British actor Simon Pegg.
*18:46.400- 18:50.540* :  And the title of this letter is proud to pay more and it's not subtle.
*18:50.540- 18:53.440* :  It says, elected leaders must tax us the super rich.
*18:53.720- 18:55.240* :  We'd be proud to pay more.
*18:55.640- 19:00.360* :  It even breaks down the areas they'd be proud to pay towards and that's education, health
*19:00.360- 19:05.500* :  care, environmental systems and does let us behind the curtain a bit too.
*19:05.500- 19:09.980* :  It says they've actually been asking for years to be taxed more and we do know some of those
*19:09.980- 19:13.980* :  signing have been campaigning in their own countries, but to no avail.
*19:14.480- 19:19.860* :  It adds quite frankly that more tax would have no impact on their lives or on the lives
*19:20.080- 19:20.980* :  of their children.
*19:21.540- 19:24.620* :  And if you're thinking, why don't they make donations or commit to philanthropy?
*19:25.200- 19:25.820* :  They address that.
*19:25.860- 19:29.560* :  They say it's not enough because of what they call a colossal imbalance.
*19:30.360- 19:34.920* :  And that imbalance, the inequality gap is widened and there's increasing evidence for
*19:34.920- 19:35.460* :  that, isn't there?
*19:35.880- 19:39.800* :  Yes, the welfare organisation Oxfam, they've just released report and it states the
*19:39.800- 19:44.340* :  vast majority of wealth is being condensed into just a few hands in their words.
*19:44.540- 19:50.360* :  The data says since 2020, the wealth of the five richest people in the world has doubled
*19:50.360- 19:53.240* :  while the wealth of the poorest 60% has fallen.
*19:53.640- 19:58.040* :  So their international executive actor, he's in Davos and he echoed the sentiments of that
*19:58.040- 19:58.380* :  letter.
*19:59.080- 20:05.800* :  We do need to have these fundamental conversations here that you cannot continue with such levels
*20:05.800- 20:07.540* :  of obscene economic inequality.
*20:08.100- 20:14.780* :  So it's important that we cap the CO salaries, break up monopolies, tax the super rich.
*20:14.880- 20:20.220* :  We also need to then ensure that living wages are paid across the supply chain.
*20:21.240- 20:27.260* :  So that was Imita Behar from Oxfam and he also said having any billionaires in society
*20:27.260- 20:33.020* :  is in his words a failure in expressed despair at the prospect of the world's first trillionaire
*20:33.260- 20:36.220* :  being a real possibility within the next decade.
*20:37.440- 20:40.520* :  Stephanie Prenches there speaking to my colleague Nick Miles.
*20:43.540- 20:48.480* :  Still to come, the tiny insect invaders that pose a big threat to humans.
*20:49.100- 20:53.900* :  In the USA, large numbers of people have been killed by them and this is something that
*20:53.900- 20:55.280* :  could be spreading through Europe.
*21:02.560- 21:06.440* :  This is the story of the charismatic Nigerian preacher, TB Joshua.
*21:07.080- 21:08.760* :  He called him a miracle worker.
*21:21.840- 21:22.700* :  Others say they knew a very different man.
*21:23.120- 21:28.480* :  This is World of Secrets from the BBC World Service, Season 2, The Disciples.
*21:29.160- 21:32.100* :  Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*21:36.420- 21:38.520* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*21:39.620- 21:44.120* :  Security forces in Uganda have been blockading the homes of the country's two main opposition
*21:44.120- 21:47.560* :  politicians ahead of a planned protest in the capital campala.
*21:48.180- 21:53.240* :  Both the former pop star and one-time presidential challenger Bobby Wein and another former presidential
*21:53.240- 21:58.760* :  contender, Kizah Fesej, say soldiers and police officers are preventing them from leaving.
*21:59.380- 22:04.420* :  The protests about the poor condition of Uganda's roads have been called to coincide with
*22:04.420- 22:08.940* :  the visit by heads of state who are coming to Uganda to attend an international summit.
*22:09.500- 22:13.780* :  Our African regional editor Will Ross told us more about why the police were stopping
*22:13.780- 22:17.120* :  these leading opposition figures from leaving their homes.
*22:17.720- 22:22.300* :  Well, it's something that's happened quite often when the opposition has tried to call
*22:23.220- 22:23.240* :  demonstrations.
*22:23.320- 22:29.840* :  The police and the military have often carried out what they've called in the past preventative
*22:29.840- 22:35.040* :  arrests trying to stop people from committing crimes before it happens, which is a rather
*22:35.040- 22:36.240* :  strange way of looking at it.
*22:36.260- 22:43.460* :  But certainly Bobby Wein and Kizah Fesej have posted on social media about being basically
*22:43.460- 22:50.140* :  trapped in their homes and in the case of Kizah Fesej, his wife, Winnie Biannuma, has posted
*22:50.140- 22:57.700* :  a video where she shows police officers on their own property, basically putting them
*22:57.700- 22:59.080* :  under house arrest as it were.
*22:59.080- 23:05.120* :  This is all partly to do with the fact that there are big summits going on in Uganda.
*23:05.860- 23:11.760* :  And clearly, the opposition wanted to kind of highlight some of the problems Ugandans
*23:11.760- 23:15.340* :  are facing and they've got many problems, but one of them happens to be potholes on
*23:15.340- 23:16.420* :  the roads of Kampala.
*23:16.520- 23:22.900* :  So they've urged people to go and plant banana plants in those potholes to sort of show
*23:22.900- 23:27.620* :  them off and show to the world that there are problems going on, but of course, often
*23:27.620- 23:32.320* :  with opposition protests, then you get the tear gas and the arrests and the spotlight
*23:32.320- 23:37.660* :  would be on the opposition rather than on the government showing off what it has achieved
*23:37.660- 23:38.940* :  at these summits.
*23:39.280- 23:44.480* :  Yes, this is all very embarrassing for the government of Uganda's longtime ruler, you're
*23:44.480- 23:45.360* :  very maceveney.
*23:46.140- 23:52.240* :  Well, the authorities, it seems, are trying to avoid any bigger embarrassment by allowing
*23:52.240- 23:57.160* :  these opposition people to build up a head of steam and have huge protests, which they
*23:57.160- 23:58.880* :  have managed to galvanize before.
*23:58.880- 24:04.360* :  So rather than that, they think it's better to have headlines that these opposition leaders
*24:04.360- 24:05.420* :  are under house arrest.
*24:06.020- 24:11.300* :  And President Masseveney in power since 1986 has always taken a very tough line against
*24:11.300- 24:15.740* :  the opposition, which has complained that many elections haven't been free and fair and
*24:15.740- 24:19.000* :  they haven't been free to protest or take part in proper democracy.
*24:19.260- 24:21.900* :  And briefly, do you think protesters could still turn out?
*24:22.420- 24:27.400* :  There have been a handful and we've seen photos of people planting these banana leaves,
*24:27.600- 24:27.780* :  etc.
*24:28.220- 24:31.520* :  But I don't think without these characters on the streets, I don't think there will
*24:31.520- 24:36.880* :  be very large protests so that the big summits will go ahead without the opposition kind of
*24:36.880- 24:37.680* :  being in the spotlight.
*24:38.700- 24:45.320* :  Will Ross, last year saw the biggest influx of asylum seekers to the EU since 2016, more
*24:45.320- 24:49.720* :  than a quarter of a million of them reached Europe by land and sea, according to the
*24:49.720- 24:51.020* :  UN Refugee Agency.
*24:51.720- 24:56.380* :  Many came across the Mediterranean, but the route through the Balkans via Bulgaria has become
*24:56.380- 25:02.480* :  increasingly important, a network of smuggling organisations facilitates the asylum seekers
*25:02.480- 25:04.360* :  onward journey to Western Europe.
*25:05.060- 25:10.400* :  Nick Thorpe travelled to the northwest of Bulgaria, a region notorious for its poverty and
*25:10.400- 25:12.800* :  neglect to meet the people's smugglers.
*25:12.800- 25:21.780* :  I'm going down some steps into a basement, then along a dark corridor following Slavi
*25:21.780- 25:26.960* :  who's leading the way with the light on his mobile phone into a bare room with a makeshift
*25:26.960- 25:28.100* :  bar but no drinks.
*25:30.700- 25:35.160* :  Slavi and his friend Svetlo suggested this as a place we could talk in private.
*25:35.840- 25:40.740* :  Both were convicted of smuggling migrants, mostly Afghans across Bulgaria.
*25:41.560- 25:46.860* :  Slavi was only released from jail four months ago, after serving two and a half years.
*25:54.880- 25:57.100* :  We were eight men to a cell, that's really hard.
*25:58.160- 26:01.480* :  Each person is supposed to have four square metres of space, but in reality we didn't have
*26:01.480- 26:07.160* :  one square metre where it's a share of bathroom among 110 men and sometimes it wasn't even
*26:07.160- 26:08.100* :  enough water for a shower.
*26:08.660- 26:13.940* :  It's a desire to highlight these conditions in Bulgarian prisons that has motivated Slavi
*26:13.940- 26:16.100* :  and Svetlo's decision to talk to me.
*26:16.640- 26:21.780* :  Slavi's job as a smuggler was to organise other drivers and pick up migrants from the
*26:21.780- 26:24.460* :  capital and drive them to the border with Serbia.
*26:24.860- 26:32.600* :  There were very poor neighbourhoods in Sofia, incredibly poor neighbourhoods, very small
*26:32.600- 26:33.040* :  houses.
*26:33.600- 26:36.240* :  They were like animal shelters, that's how we used to pick them up from.
*26:36.980- 26:42.240* :  They were between 18 and 30, suppose, and they were really hungry and cold, really miserable.
*26:43.340- 26:44.680* :  You could see the suffering in their eyes.
*26:45.120- 26:47.540* :  And it was always men, or women and children too.
*26:48.460- 26:54.100* :  There were women and children on one occasion and when we gave them something to eat, you
*26:54.100- 26:55.500* :  could see the joy in their eyes.
*26:56.100- 26:59.300* :  How many migrants could you carry at one time?
*26:59.660- 27:01.340* :  I mean, you're tossing the Dutch record.
*27:02.000- 27:02.940* :  No, about eight or nine.
*27:04.280- 27:07.660* :  Our cars are small and we really had to squeeze them in hard and to be honest it wasn't
*27:07.660- 27:08.580* :  comfortable for us either.
*27:08.860- 27:13.420* :  And there was another thing, I don't really like to say this, but it wasn't easier because
*27:13.420- 27:15.760* :  it was nearly smelly in the car.
*27:16.440- 27:21.660* :  After ten runs to the border for Slavi, just two for Svetlo, they were caught by police.
*27:24.960- 27:27.040* :  They were paid 50 euros per migrant.
*27:27.500- 27:29.980* :  They blame their arrest on their lowly status.
*27:30.440- 27:33.640* :  Big time smugglers, they say, simply pay off the police.
*27:34.200- 27:39.780* :  An allegation surprisingly confirmed by the man until recently responsible for cracking
*27:39.780- 27:41.340* :  down on police corruption.
*27:41.780- 27:43.060* :  I'm Paulink Kujachrestov.
*27:43.640- 27:48.180* :  I work 27 years for Ministry of Interior of Bulgaria.
*27:55.720- 28:03.260* :  The most interesting case I had involved a group we arrested in the south of Bulgaria.
*28:04.060- 28:08.820* :  We knew there was a fifth man who was a member of the border police, but we couldn't identify
*28:08.820- 28:09.260* :  him.
*28:09.940- 28:12.860* :  Then a man turned up and said he wanted to turn himself in.
*28:13.680- 28:16.240* :  It turned out he was the man who'd been looking for.
*28:17.300- 28:19.780* :  And he brought a thousand euros with him.
*28:20.120- 28:24.440* :  He said that was all he'd got left from what had been paid because he'd been getting drunk
*28:24.440- 28:25.100* :  every night.
*28:26.000- 28:30.800* :  And he said it actually burned some of the money because he was worried it'd been marked
*28:30.800- 28:31.640* :  by the police.
*28:35.460- 28:41.700* :  Back in Septemberitzi, their village in the dilapidated sad lands of northwest Bulgaria, Slavi
*28:41.700- 28:46.160* :  and Svetlo say they won't return to smuggling even though business is booming.
*28:46.760- 28:48.080* :  There are big sums on offer.
*28:48.100- 28:53.060* :  Svetlo just turned down a single run for 15,000 euros, he says.
*28:54.020- 28:58.620* :  Did you feel guilty about making money out of the misery of these people?
*29:02.120- 29:09.160* :  In general now, looking back, I'm not comfortable with that, but that was a situation about
*29:10.080- 29:10.100* :  that.
*29:10.540- 29:13.580* :  It was good for the migrants who were escaping and it was good for me too.
*29:14.960- 29:19.960* :  The smugglers have taken Slavi and Svetlo's places in the long secretive chain.
*29:20.560- 29:22.500* :  The big players rarely get caught.
*29:22.920- 29:29.280* :  The small timers, like Slavi and Svetlo from poor rundown Bulgarian villages, seem not
*29:29.280- 29:34.680* :  so different from the people they squeeze into their cars for this segment of the Balkan
*29:38.700- 29:38.720* :  route.
*29:38.780- 29:43.720* :  And you can hear more from Nick Forbes investigation into the business of people smuggling in
*29:43.720- 29:49.360* :  Bulgaria on this week's edition of assignment on the BBC World Service.
*29:51.140- 29:56.100* :  Cheryl Sandberg, the former chief operating officer of Meta, the company that owns Facebook,
*29:56.100- 29:59.080* :  has announced that she's stepping down from its board of directors.
*29:59.900- 30:03.940* :  She said it had been the opportunity of a lifetime, but it felt like the right time
*30:03.940- 30:04.780* :  to step away.
*30:05.580- 30:10.380* :  As one of Mark Zuckerberg's senior executives, Sandberg has seen as having played a key
*30:10.380- 30:13.940* :  role in turning Facebook into a profit powerhouse.
*30:14.460- 30:15.720* :  Michelle Flurry reports.
*30:16.760- 30:22.540* :  Cheryl Sandberg stepped down as Meta's chief operating officer in 2022, after 14 years
*30:22.540- 30:23.260* :  in the role.
*30:23.700- 30:28.100* :  Today, she said she wouldn't be seeking re-election to the board when her turn runs out in May,
*30:28.480- 30:30.100* :  as she's held for 12 years.
*30:30.640- 30:35.160* :  In a Facebook post, she said she wanted to spend more time on philanthropic work, but
*30:35.160- 30:39.140* :  added that she would still serve as an adviser to Facebook's parent company Meta.
*30:39.880- 30:44.500* :  This Sandberg was already well-known in the tech industry when she joined Facebook in 2008.
*30:45.180- 30:49.240* :  During her tenure, she helped transform it into one of the most powerful companies in
*30:49.240- 30:52.160* :  the world, and guided it through significant criticism.
*30:53.100- 30:57.980* :  Commenting on her post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said her dedication and guidance had been
*30:57.980- 31:00.040* :  instrumental to Meta's success.
*31:01.020- 31:01.800* :  Michelle Flurry.
*31:02.560- 31:08.400* :  In Queensland, in Australia, fire ants have been filmed, building rafts to survive and
*31:08.400- 31:09.960* :  travel on in flood waters.
*31:10.620- 31:16.420* :  It's just one example of the ability of these super pests to invade countries they've
*31:16.580- 31:18.440* :  even been found in Europe recently.
*31:19.040- 31:24.260* :  Jack Goff from Australia's Invasive Species Council told us more about the growing threat
*31:24.260- 31:25.620* :  they pose to humans.
*31:26.360- 31:31.120* :  Look, fire ants are, as you say, one of the world's super pests, quite a large portion
*31:31.140- 31:35.900* :  of southern United States does have this invasion of fire ants, which can transform the way
*31:35.900- 31:40.240* :  of life for societies in terms of people not being able to go outside, their foot being
*31:40.240- 31:45.720* :  stung and causing increased numbers of medical visits, fire ants have come across to Australia
*31:45.720- 31:48.480* :  about two decades ago from the United States.
*31:49.280- 31:53.420* :  Fortunately, Australia is probably the world leader when it comes to having really strong
*31:53.420- 31:55.100* :  biosecurity protocols.
*31:55.460- 32:00.620* :  There's been a really concerted effort, which is limited their spread, and by comparison
*32:00.620- 32:05.480* :  in the United States, we've seen fire ants move at a rate of about 40 to 45 kilometres
*32:05.480- 32:10.680* :  per year up from the south, and in China, they've been moving at about 80 kilometres a year.
*32:11.020- 32:16.040* :  In Australia, we've kept them to a rate of spread of about four to five kilometres per
*32:16.040- 32:19.700* :  year because of the effort of governments, but they're getting into more and more areas
*32:19.700- 32:25.540* :  and with floods, more active after that weather, and they can form these incredible rafts,
*32:25.540- 32:30.140* :  and they have this swarming behaviour, which means that if you disturb their nest, if you
*32:30.140- 32:34.540* :  step on their nest, they'll come out in really large numbers, and so we see these people
*32:34.540- 32:40.220* :  covered in welts all over their arms and legs, and in the USA, large numbers of people have
*32:40.460- 32:46.200* :  been killed by them, and the rate of anaphylaxis, so people having these allergic reaction, is
*32:46.200- 32:51.200* :  three times higher than what it is for bees, and so it can start to put really serious pressure
*32:51.200- 32:56.020* :  on the health system, and fire ants were actually just found in September last year in Italy,
*32:56.460- 33:01.880* :  and there are large parts of Europe are also climatically suitable for fire ants to spread,
*33:01.880- 33:04.700* :  and so this is something that could be spreading through Europe.
*33:05.340- 33:10.240* :  Jack Goff, now to an ethical question that's vexing literary critics in Japan.
*33:10.240- 33:15.660* :  Doesn't author, deserve an award if part of their book was generated by artificial intelligence?
*33:16.360- 33:21.120* :  Ria Kudan, whose novel sympathy tower has won one of Japan's most prestigious prizes,
*33:21.820- 33:27.040* :  says about five percent of it was generated by the chatbot chatGPT.
*33:27.620- 33:33.520* :  She said AI had helped her to unlock her creativity, but our questions are being asked about whether
*33:33.520- 33:37.800* :  she should have been given an award at all if she didn't really create all the work.
*33:38.340- 33:43.660* :  Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Bristo, says she's arguing AI can now be part of the creative
*33:43.660- 33:46.160* :  process rather than a threat to it.
*33:46.760- 33:50.960* :  Do you think somebody who had written a book and admitted that somebody else or something
*33:50.960- 33:54.660* :  else had written part of that book would be slightly embarrassed by that because it's
*33:54.660- 33:58.420* :  not their own work, but this isn't what the author Ria Kudan actually did.
*33:58.900- 34:06.320* :  She didn't confess, she just revealed, admitted, said that she'd used these AI programs
*34:06.320- 34:13.460* :  to generate, she said, five percent of her book was written verbitim by these AI programs,
*34:14.000- 34:19.640* :  and she said other bits of it were inspired by the interaction she'd had with these programs
*34:20.800- 34:25.360* :  over the previous months, so perhaps more of it was generated by AI.
*34:25.400- 34:29.740* :  And as I said, she thought it's part of a creative process, not something to be embarrassed
*34:29.740- 34:36.820* :  about, but something just to admit and reveal, and it really moves us into a new part of writing
*34:36.820- 34:39.800* :  and creativity and what is authorship.
*34:40.620- 34:45.780* :  Yes, because it's one thing to be inspired, another thing to have chatGPT writing part
*34:45.780- 34:47.900* :  of your novel, even if it's only five percent.
*34:47.920- 34:50.980* :  What have people been saying in response to her revelation?
*34:51.380- 34:55.660* :  Well, broadly speaking, there are two camps, there are some people who have praised what
*34:55.660- 34:59.480* :  she's done saying, of course, yeah, it just helped the creative process and produces
*34:59.480- 35:03.980* :  a novel which is far more rich and deep than it would have been had she just written
*35:03.980- 35:08.740* :  in herself, but of course, there are those that disagree with this and say, really, it's
*35:08.740- 35:15.340* :  more or less wrong, and it's undermined what is, what of Japan's most prestigious literary
*35:15.900- 35:15.920* :  awards.
*35:17.060- 35:17.640* :  Mickey Bristo.
