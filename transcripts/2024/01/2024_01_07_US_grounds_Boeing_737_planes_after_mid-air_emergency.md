*00:23.560- 00:27.420* :  That Carrie Grant is a character. Be very careful about how he's perceived.
*00:27.800- 00:29.280* :  Yet few truly knew him.
*00:29.400- 00:32.200* :  I have loved a lot of people and everyone's broken my heart.

*00:37.740- 00:38.260* :  No, why?
*00:38.580- 00:39.020* :  Nothing.

*00:51.360- 00:53.780* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little.
*00:54.080- 00:57.700* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*00:57.700- 01:01.500* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:01.760- 01:06.760* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:24.680- 01:27.820* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Sunday,
*01:27.820- 01:33.380* :  the 7th of January. The US Air Safety Regulator has grounded more than 170 planes
*01:33.380- 01:38.240* :  after a panel blew out of a Boeing 737 MAX airliner in mid-air.
*01:38.500- 01:40.980* :  I looked to my left and there's this huge chunk,
*01:41.040- 01:42.980* :  part of the airplane, just like missing,
*01:42.980- 01:47.620* :  and the wind is just extremely loud. There's wind blowing everywhere.
*01:48.200- 01:52.700* :  The Israeli Army says it's broken Hamas' military structure in northern Gaza,
*01:53.420- 01:56.260* :  and as Eastern Ukraine is hit by a deadly Russian missile strike,
*01:56.260- 02:00.700* :  we hear about those risking their lives in Crimea to help Ukraine fight back.
*02:00.940- 02:03.820* :  There was a terrible moment just after I'd been investigating an object.
*02:03.820- 02:06.880* :  I wanted to hide a notice, but I saw Russian servicemen.
*02:07.040- 02:10.540* :  They just miraculously didn't talk to me. I was petrified.
*02:13.020- 02:18.080* :  Also in the podcast, an Iranian woman flogged for not wearing a hijab speaks out about her
*02:18.080- 02:23.240* :  ordeal, and the palace where Alexander the Great was crowned King of Macedonia
*02:23.580- 02:25.380* :  reopens after more than a decade.
*02:29.880- 02:34.880* :  Nearly five years ago, all Boeing 737 MAX airliners were grounded after two
*02:34.880- 02:41.840* :  crashes, which killed a total of 346 people. Boeing made changes to the automated flight control
*02:41.840- 02:47.640* :  system, and the jet was returned to service. But now the US Air Safety Regulator has ordered
*02:48.780- 02:53.740* :  170 MAX-9 aircraft to undergo immediate checks before they're allowed to fly again.
*02:53.740- 02:58.980* :  It followed a shocking incident when a panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines flight from Oregon
*02:58.980- 03:02.740* :  to California. From Washington, Shanghai, NY, at this report.
*03:03.520- 03:10.660* :  Flight 1282 carrying 177 passengers was 35 minutes into its journey from Oregon to Ontario,
*03:10.660- 03:15.840* :  California, when part of the fuselage was torn off, leaving a hole in the side of the aircraft.
*03:15.840- 03:20.280* :  The pilot was forced to alert aircraft control to the severity of the situation.
*03:23.340- 03:28.400* :  Passengers spoke of hearing a loud bang before emergency oxygen masks dropped.
*03:28.400- 03:33.680* :  Video footage shot on board shows the dangling masks and a huge gap where the windows
*03:33.680- 03:37.640* :  should have been, and the passengers themselves staying remarkably calm.
*03:38.080- 03:42.500* :  I looked to my left and there's this huge chunk part of the airplane just like missing,
*03:42.560- 03:47.080* :  and the wind is just extremely loud. There's wind blowing everywhere.
*03:50.060- 03:55.560* :  The plane landed safely at Portland to the relief of all on board, among them, Evan Smith.
*03:55.880- 03:59.600* :  There's not anything I have any control over. It's just wait and see what happens.
*03:59.600- 04:04.740* :  And they said there was a kid in that row who his shirt was sucked off him and out of the plane,
*04:04.740- 04:07.900* :  and his mother was holding on to him to make sure he didn't go with it.
*04:08.140- 04:13.260* :  Alaska Airlines said in a statement that inspections on more than a quarter of the 7379
*04:13.260- 04:19.120* :  fleet were completed so far with no concerning findings, but they are growing questions as to how a
*04:19.120- 04:24.420* :  new jet delivered in late October and certified in early November could have developed this problem.
*04:24.720- 04:27.960* :  This is the latest mishap involving Boeing's best-selling model.
*04:27.960- 04:33.160* :  The planes were grounded for almost two years following crashes in 2018 and 2019.
*04:33.700- 04:38.000* :  Alaska Airlines, the National Transport Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Authority
*04:38.000- 04:41.620* :  have all confirmed that they will launch investigations into the incident.
*04:42.140- 04:44.040* :  Ching Hai, Nyoka reporting from Washington.
*04:45.180- 04:48.000* :  Three months after the massacre of the 7th of October,
*04:48.540- 04:52.720* :  Israel says it has completed the dismantling of Hamas' military framework
*04:52.720- 04:57.700* :  in the northern Gaza Strip. It said it had killed around 8,000 militants there.
*04:58.220- 05:00.460* :  Our correspondent Wira Davis reports from Jerusalem.
*05:01.280- 05:05.940* :  More than 22,000 people have been killed by Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza,
*05:06.440- 05:08.400* :  according to the Hamas' run health ministry.
*05:08.940- 05:14.380* :  But Israel has vowed that campaign will continue methodically in central and southern Gaza
*05:14.840- 05:16.280* :  until its mission is accomplished.
*05:16.840- 05:20.000* :  In a statement released three months to the day since the war began,
*05:20.000- 05:23.920* :  an Israeli army spokesman said it had successfully disrupted
*05:24.460- 05:28.100* :  Hamas' operations in much of northern Gaza, including Jabalya,
*05:28.440- 05:31.160* :  rendering them incapable of organised action.
*05:31.680- 05:36.680* :  Last month, the Israeli army said it had tragically and mistakenly killed three hostages,
*05:36.680- 05:40.940* :  Yotam Haim, Alon Shamritz and Samar El Talalka.
*05:41.200- 05:45.480* :  They had been held by Hamas in Gaza after being abducted on October 7.
*05:45.480- 05:51.680* :  A new video released by Hamas on its social media channels features statements from the three men
*05:51.680- 05:55.820* :  sometime before they died in the video which was filmed under duress.
*05:56.180- 06:00.440* :  They suggest that the places in which they were being held were under Israeli bombardment
*06:00.800- 06:02.280* :  and they were moved frequently.
*06:02.280- 06:07.100* :  Hamas says a fourth hostage in the video identified as Sakhi Idhan
*06:07.100- 06:09.840* :  was also killed in an Israeli airstrike,
*06:09.840- 06:11.900* :  a claim that has not been verified.
*06:11.900- 06:16.100* :  The message from the Hamas video is that Israel is killing its own
*06:16.520- 06:18.080* :  and that the shelling should stop.
*06:18.720- 06:19.300* :  Wira Davis.
*06:19.300- 06:25.320* :  The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has now begun his latest diplomatic mission to the region.
*06:25.860- 06:31.240* :  As he prepared to travel to Jordan, he said America wanted to stop any escalation in the fighting.
*06:31.880- 06:37.580* :  It is vital that we engage in this diplomacy now both for the sake of the future of Gaza itself
*06:37.580- 06:41.000* :  and more broadly the sake of the future for Israelis and Palestinians
*06:41.520- 06:42.580* :  and for the region as a whole.
*06:42.800- 06:46.180* :  There is clearly a strong desire among the majority of people in the region
*06:46.480- 06:48.460* :  for a future that is one of peace.
*06:48.880- 06:54.080* :  However, clashes on Israel's northern border have already intensified with the powerful
*06:54.080- 06:57.200* :  Lebanese group Hasbalah launching a barrage of rockets.
*06:57.200- 07:02.840* :  In what it said was its initial response to the assassination of a Hamas leader in Lebanon earlier in the week.
*07:09.260- 07:12.820* :  Israel has not reported any casualties in the attacks on Saturday
*07:12.820- 07:14.940* :  and said it had retaliated.
*07:14.940- 07:19.540* :  The European Union foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell, who is currently in Beirut,
*07:19.540- 07:24.160* :  said it was imperative to avoid Lebanon being dragged into a wider regional conflict.
*07:24.840- 07:29.860* :  The Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Nanjim Mikhati assured him that the Lebanese government
*07:29.860- 07:32.560* :  was doing all it could to try to avoid a war.
*07:33.240- 07:40.320* :  The Lebanese government is actively seeking to de-skilling and the Lebanese are exercising
*07:40.940- 07:41.720* :  self-restraint.
*07:42.120- 07:46.400* :  The first is to avert a war that will have terrible consequences
*07:47.200- 07:48.560* :  regionally and internationally.
*07:48.560- 07:56.000* :  Second issue, only political solution will put an end to the conflict in the Middle East.
*07:56.420- 07:57.260* :  Nanjim Mikhati.
*07:57.260- 08:03.380* :  Israel and Hasbalah have exchanged fire across the border almost daily since the Gaza war began.
*08:03.380- 08:07.320* :  For more on that and details of the latest strikes on Israel by Hasbalah,
*08:07.600- 08:10.080* :  I spoke to our Beirut correspondent Hugo Bichiga.
*08:10.680- 08:12.600* :  It was a massive rocket attack.
*08:12.600- 08:18.520* :  Hasbalah said it had fired more than 60 rockets at positions in northern Israel.
*08:19.140- 08:24.320* :  The Israeli military said it had identified dozens of launches from Lebanon.
*08:24.320- 08:29.080* :  So tensions have been high but what happened this morning was unusual.
*08:29.120- 08:34.320* :  I think it's also very interesting that we heard from the caretaker Prime Minister here in
*08:34.320- 08:38.100* :  Lebanon talking about the need to prevent an escalation of the crisis.
*08:38.500- 08:43.520* :  He's in a very difficult position because he's got virtually no influence over what
*08:43.860- 08:45.100* :  Hasbalah decides to do.
*08:45.100- 08:52.320* :  This powerful shear movement that is supported by Iran and acts as a state within a state here
*08:52.320- 08:52.840* :  in Lebanon.
*08:52.840- 08:56.040* :  So it's a very difficult position for the Lebanese authorities as well.
*08:56.340- 09:00.520* :  Up until now, Hasbalah's actions have been really calculated because
*09:00.520- 09:04.300* :  lots of people here still remember what happened in 2006.
*09:04.300- 09:09.980* :  The war between Israel and Hasbalah, the destruction that was brought by this conflict.
*09:10.400- 09:16.280* :  So I think even Hasbalah, they are calculating their actions to try to prevent a major
*09:16.280- 09:17.200* :  response from Israel.
*09:17.440- 09:21.800* :  At the start of the war in Gaza, it was suggested Israel didn't want to see an
*09:21.800- 09:25.640* :  upsurge in fighting on its northern border, i.e. with Hasbalah.
*09:25.900- 09:27.220* :  Has that calculation changed?
*09:27.260- 09:31.120* :  Because we've recently heard comments from a number of Israeli leaders saying
*09:31.120- 09:35.100* :  time is running out for a solution to the problems on that northern border.
*09:35.560- 09:41.120* :  Yeah, so we heard from the defense minister who said there was a short window for a diplomatic
*09:41.120- 09:46.560* :  solution to try to ease tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border.
*09:46.560- 09:51.140* :  There has been a massive disruption to life in that part of the country because of this
*09:51.140- 09:56.460* :  constant attacks by Hasbalah and both the authorities are saying that this situation is
*09:56.720- 10:00.540* :  unsustainable and they need to restore security in northern Israel.
*10:00.540- 10:03.780* :  So you had the defense minister saying that there was
*10:03.780- 10:09.720* :  possibility still of a diplomatic solution but at the same time some senior figures in the
*10:09.720- 10:15.060* :  Israeli government defend a larger offensive against Hasbalah to reduce the threat
*10:15.060- 10:19.020* :  posed by the group and obviously these attacks that have been carried out by Hasbalah.
*10:19.760- 10:22.700* :  And that was Hugo Bachega in the Lebanese capital Beirut.
*10:23.660- 10:28.060* :  In recent weeks both Russia and Ukraine have stepped up their attacks on each other's territory
*10:28.060- 10:32.280* :  with some of the heaviest bombardments since Russia invaded nearly two years ago.
*10:32.280- 10:37.820* :  The latest Russian missile strike on the eastern Ukrainian town of Pogrovsk has left 11
*10:37.820- 10:43.200* :  people dead including five children according to local officials. The town is in Ukrainian
*10:43.200- 10:48.420* :  held territory in the partly occupied Donetsk region, more from our Ukraine correspondent James
*10:48.420- 10:54.500* :  Waterhouse. Rescue teams are sifting through rubble after Russian forces reportedly hit Pogrovsk
*10:54.620- 10:58.840* :  and the surrounding area with missiles typically used in air defense systems.
*10:59.360- 11:05.520* :  It's a relatively small city with a pre-invasion population of 60,000 yet people have been returning
*11:05.520- 11:11.440* :  to live there despite warnings from officials that it's too dangerous. It saw a deadly bombardment
*11:11.440- 11:16.640* :  last August which left nine people dead and more than 80 injured. In his evening address,
*11:16.640- 11:21.520* :  President Zelensky said Russia should always feel consequences for these kind of attacks.
*11:21.580- 11:27.400* :  Earlier this week Ukrainian forces launched more than 70 drones across the border into Russia
*11:27.400- 11:32.900* :  after Moscow launched its biggest aerial bombardment. It's led to evacuations in the
*11:32.900- 11:39.140* :  southwestern city of Belgorod. James Waterhouse. One of Ukraine's main targets is Russian
*11:39.140- 11:45.820* :  occupied Crimea. The peninsula was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, but following Russia's
*11:45.820- 11:50.700* :  full-scale invasion, a resistance movement has sprung up there. It says it's aiding Ukrainian
*11:50.700- 11:56.440* :  attacks with vital intelligence. Our correspondent Jessica Parker has been in contact with five men
*11:56.440- 12:02.300* :  who say they are spying for Ukraine inside Crimea. Here is one with his words spoken by an actor.
*12:05.060- 12:10.440* :  I had a hunch that someone was always watching. I don't know why. I was constantly looking around.
*12:10.460- 12:19.000* :  My heart was pounding. A man who we're calling agent one describes taking photos as he crutches
*12:19.000- 12:24.940* :  down behind some bushes. You hear about the work of partisans doing the work is quite another.
*12:26.180- 12:32.320* :  Via a messaging app, he tells us about his secret life spying on the Russian military
*12:32.320- 12:37.340* :  in occupied Crimea. There was a terrible moment just after I'd been investigating an object.
*12:37.340- 12:43.620* :  I wanted to hide unnoticed, but I saw Russian servicemen. They just miraculously didn't talk to me.
*12:43.900- 12:48.860* :  I managed to lean down by the car and pretended that I had a problem with the wheel. I was petrified.
*12:49.340- 12:55.480* :  Agent one gets away safely. He and others have told us they're part of a resistance movement called
*12:55.480- 13:05.800* :  a Tesh. It means fire in the Crimean Tata language. A woman cries out. She's seen an explosion.
*13:05.800- 13:13.120* :  It's an attack on two Russian warships stationed in Sevastopol. That's Crimea's biggest city where
*13:13.180- 13:20.240* :  last September, Ukraine would also go on to hit the HQ of Russia's Black Sea fleet. It made international
*13:20.300- 13:28.440* :  news. Certainly it appears that Russia's Black Sea naval headquarters in Sevastopol has been
*13:28.440- 13:37.000* :  directly hit. A Tesh says it's intel aided these attacks and others. Agent one says he knows he's
*13:37.000- 13:42.320* :  doing dangerous work. If I get noticed by the Russians, I think I'll be reported right away.
*13:42.680- 13:47.840* :  Agent one's account and those of four more men we've been in contact with can't be
*13:47.840- 13:53.960* :  independently verified. They won't reveal their identities. But a senior source within Ukraine's
*13:53.960- 14:00.180* :  defense and intelligence services says the testimonies are credible. Agent one believes his work
*14:00.180- 14:04.920* :  is valuable. I have been informed more than once that thanks to my coordinates or photos,
*14:04.920- 14:10.340* :  Russian equipment was destroyed. This inspires me to continue to liberate Crimea.
*14:10.960- 14:15.860* :  Some Russian media bloggers dismiss Atesh as an invention of Ukrainian intelligence
*14:15.860- 14:22.780* :  designed to overstate levels of resistance. Yet Atesh is reportedly designated by Russia as a
*14:22.780- 14:29.460* :  banned terrorist organization being caught could mean a lengthy jail term. Of course there are risks
*14:29.460- 14:35.480* :  because we live in terrible conditions of propaganda and control. So why would spies inside Crimea
*14:35.480- 14:41.420* :  talk to us? Our main contact, who says he's a handler based in an unoccupied Ukraine,
*14:41.420- 14:48.260* :  tells us that Atesh hopes to expand its network. Agent one says he wants to send a message.
*14:48.920- 14:53.700* :  I agree to talk to you in order to convey information to people. The Crimeans are not all zombies
*14:53.700- 14:59.580* :  here and are ready to resist even in conditions of total censorship. Atesh even claims to have
*14:59.580- 15:06.740* :  agents within Russia's military, but the world of espionage is a murky one showing again that
*15:06.740- 15:16.020* :  this war stretches far beyond the battlefield. Ahead of today's election, Bangladesh has been
*15:16.020- 15:20.740* :  hit by a spate of violence and arson attacks. Both the government and opposition have accused
*15:20.740- 15:26.200* :  each other of carrying out acts of sabotage. The main opposition party, the BNP, is boycotting
*15:26.200- 15:30.320* :  the vote, calling it a sham and has started a two-day strike across the country.
*15:38.980- 15:46.020* :  There are 120 million eligible voters in Bangladesh, but this protestor, Arman al-Hak, won't be
*15:46.020- 15:53.240* :  taking part. This is not a participatory election because we can see that BNP and other political
*15:53.240- 16:00.180* :  parties are not joining in this election, so we are young, we can't trust this election.
*16:00.680- 16:04.360* :  Well as a result of the boycott, it looks clear that the current Prime Minister,
*16:04.360- 16:09.080* :  Sheikh Hasena and her ruling Awami League, will secure a fourth term in office.
*16:09.080- 16:14.000* :  Our South Asia Regional Editor, Sanjay Deskpta, told me about the latest trouble in Bangladesh.
*16:14.880- 16:19.380* :  Reports of violence of arson continue to grow. At least 14 polling stations have been
*16:19.380- 16:23.280* :  sat on fire. These are mostly school buildings which are used as voting centres.
*16:23.920- 16:28.880* :  But this temple in the city of Chittagong has been torched. Chittagong now is known as Chautogram.
*16:28.880- 16:33.820* :  Good structs are being attacked on national highways. Earlier on Saturday, the Bangladesh Fire Service
*16:33.820- 16:41.020* :  said there had been at least 14 arson attacks in 16 hours till 9.30 a.m. in the morning local time.
*16:41.060- 16:47.560* :  There was a moving train which was sat on fire yesterday by suspected arsonists. Four people died,
*16:47.560- 16:52.300* :  two of them children. There was another attack on another moving train a week ago,
*16:52.300- 16:57.760* :  another four people died. And the police have arrested seven opposition members and blaming them
*16:57.760- 17:02.860* :  for that attack on the train on Friday. The government says the opposition is trying to
*17:02.860- 17:08.720* :  undermine the poll. Is that a credible accusation? Now among those opposition activists
*17:08.720- 17:14.780* :  arrested is a guy called Noviu Lanovi who is quite a senior leader of the main opposition
*17:14.900- 17:20.980* :  BNP party. He is behind bars suspected of having participated in that arson attack.
*17:21.680- 17:27.300* :  Now the opposition has been demanding for some time that as on previous occasions in Bangladesh,
*17:27.300- 17:33.120* :  the political tradition was that the government in power would step down and hand over to a
*17:33.120- 17:40.280* :  KTK administration usually a Supreme Court judge and elections would be held under the KTK
*17:40.280- 17:46.760* :  administration. This the opposition says ensures a free and fair poll. Now it has to be said this has
*17:46.760- 17:53.000* :  been tried in Bangladesh before and has worked in the past. The opposition was demanding the same
*17:53.000- 17:59.160* :  this time and the government has refused. This is why the opposition cries foul. This is why they say
*17:59.160- 18:04.940* :  we won't participate in the polls. Even the UN has expressed concern. Given everything we're
*18:04.940- 18:10.920* :  saying in Bangladesh, can the election on Sunday be free and fair? The Chief Election Commissioner
*18:10.920- 18:16.320* :  of Bangladesh, Kazi Habibul Awal actually held a press conference today is upbeat tone.
*18:16.460- 18:22.920* :  Flew not only in the face of logic but in the face of the facts on the ground. He seemed to suggest
*18:22.920- 18:28.160* :  that the elections would be free and fair. We are convinced that the public servants who in
*18:28.160- 18:34.120* :  be handling the election are polling and allied measures would be sincerely honestly and faithfully
*18:34.120- 18:40.740* :  discharging their duties and we are hopeful election will be free and credible. He has also said
*18:40.740- 18:47.780* :  he was worried about incidents of violence which he described as attempts to sabotage the elections.
*18:47.780- 18:54.660* :  Now that's interesting because the opposition is also saying that the government has pre-planned
*18:54.660- 19:01.420* :  these acts of sabotage. So both sides are actually accusing each other of pre-planing acts of
*19:01.420- 19:05.880* :  violence to sabotage the elections. Now South Asia Regional Editor Sanjay Duskopta.
*19:06.680- 19:10.220* :  Alexander the Great was one of the most successful military leaders of all time.
*19:10.220- 19:16.660* :  Underfeated at his death in 323 BC, here are the words of the Greek historian Plutarch
*19:16.660- 19:23.660* :  describing one of his many victories. Fortune was not kind to Alexander in the choice of
*19:23.660- 19:31.480* :  battleground but he was able to turn this to his advantage. Fighting alongside his men on the front
*19:31.480- 19:40.060* :  line he put the barbarians to flight. Nothing was wanting to complete this victory in which he overthrew
*19:40.060- 19:48.400* :  more than 110,000 of his enemies. Well now the palace where Alexander the Great was crowned King
*19:48.400- 19:54.060* :  of Macedonia has been reopened. It follows a 16 year restoration of the site in the Greek
*19:54.060- 19:59.180* :  port city of Thessaloniki and a much longer period of excavations before that. Here's our
*19:59.180- 20:04.900* :  Europe analyst Charles Haveland. The palace of Ege near Thessaloniki was the largest building
*20:04.900- 20:09.740* :  in classical Greece but was destroyed by the Romans and was unearthed through excavations
*20:09.740- 20:16.120* :  from 1865 onwards. The newly restored or rebuilt sections include massive colonnades.
*20:16.540- 20:23.240* :  Here before 8,000 people Alexander the Great was proclaimed King more than 2,300 years ago
*20:23.240- 20:28.560* :  after the assassination of his father Philip who'd had the palace built. The military campaigns
*20:28.560- 20:34.340* :  that followed saw Alexander create a Macedonian empire stretching from Egypt to Armenia to India.
*20:34.980- 20:40.020* :  Greece's Prime Minister Karyakos Mitsotakis described Friday's reopening as an event of global
*20:40.020- 20:46.320* :  importance. Charles Haveland and still to come on the global news podcast.
*20:53.920- 20:56.000* :  A world cooking record in Ghana.
*21:04.860- 21:09.680* :  The military government in Myanmar has admitted that it has lost control of a key town near the
*21:09.680- 21:14.820* :  Chinese border. It's biggest defeat in a recent offensive by an alliance of ethnic rebel groups.
*21:15.460- 21:20.760* :  The fighting has strained relations with China, which despite being an ally of Myanmar's military
*21:20.760- 21:26.640* :  junta, was willing to let the rebels capture the town of Laokai. Our Southeast Asia correspondent
*21:26.640- 21:31.780* :  Jonathan Head explains. China has a lot of influence over these groups. They can't operate
*21:31.780- 21:36.300* :  without China at least tacitly allowing them to and it's been a long game where China's
*21:36.460- 21:40.000* :  backed them because they're very powerful in their own areas and it's close to the Chinese border
*21:40.340- 21:44.380* :  while at the same time backing the Myanmar government and giving it diplomatic support.
*21:44.380- 21:48.960* :  In this particular case, China seems to have allowed the Myanmar military to take a very
*21:48.960- 21:54.340* :  significant defeat because of the public pressure to shut down these scam centers in this area
*21:54.340- 22:00.280* :  being operated by pro-military warlords and crime syndicates for a long time and the Chinese
*22:00.280- 22:03.820* :  government was very upset about these scam centers. Thousands of Chinese have been
*22:03.820- 22:08.880* :  trafficked and trapped in these scam centers being forced to work and this group that's taken over
*22:08.880- 22:14.560* :  this town of Laokai and say they've shut down 300 scam centers sent 40,000 people back to China.
*22:14.560- 22:19.440* :  It's been a big deal for now China is happy to see this happen. Whether China is willing to see the
*22:19.440- 22:24.300* :  military badly damaged the point where it loses control is a different matter. I think China fears
*22:24.300- 22:29.200* :  the kind of chaos that might follow if the military regime collapse completely so it may see
*22:29.200- 22:31.460* :  changes in Chinese policy in the next few months.
*22:31.960- 22:37.960* :  South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. An Iranian woman subjected to dozens of lashes for
*22:37.960- 22:42.820* :  refusing to wear a hijab has set out a detailed description of the brutal punishment.
*22:42.820- 22:48.260* :  Her account has provoked strong reactions online as our Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher reports.
*22:49.140- 22:54.440* :  The Kurdish Iranian activist Roya Hishmati has published a vivid account of the sentence to
*22:54.440- 23:00.440* :  74 lashes meted out to her on Wednesday. She'd been arrested for posting a photo of herself without
*23:00.440- 23:05.860* :  the hijab on a main street in Tehran. She says the room where she was flogged was like a medieval
*23:05.860- 23:11.480* :  torture chamber. She says her headscarf was forcibly placed on her head and she was then beaten on
*23:11.480- 23:17.400* :  her shoulder, her back, her buttocks and her legs. She says she chanted the main slogan of a mass
*23:17.400- 23:23.100* :  movement against the hijab that convalced Iran last year as she was being flogged. Woman life
*23:23.100- 23:28.180* :  freedom. Many have hailed her online as a heroine. Sebastian Usher.
*23:28.900- 23:32.680* :  Now let's go back to September and the launch of India's solar mission,
*23:32.680- 23:36.560* :  Aditya L1, named after the Hindu sun god.
*23:44.280- 23:48.800* :  Magnificent lift off of PSLBC 57 with Aditya L1 on board.
*23:49.420- 23:53.900* :  Well on Saturday the craft completed the one and a half million kilometer journey to reach
*23:53.900- 24:00.800* :  its intended destination in space, so-called Lagrange Point L1, where it can remain in a stable orbit
*24:00.800- 24:05.880* :  and continuously observe the sun for the next five years. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
*24:06.520- 24:11.400* :  described it as an extraordinary feat. One of those involved in the project is the astrophysicist
*24:11.400- 24:16.940* :  professor Somak Ray Chowdry, vice-chancellor of Ashoka University. He's been talking to James
*24:16.940- 24:22.800* :  Kumaris Ami. It's a very new thing for India. Such an orbit has never been done by Indian
*24:22.800- 24:27.600* :  technology. We've reached there and it's perfectly placed in a very complicated orbit,
*24:27.600- 24:32.920* :  in a place which is between the sun and the earth. It's a culmination of 10 years of work,
*24:32.920- 24:39.540* :  but also the beginning of a great scientific journey. The job of the satellite is to look at the sun
*24:39.820- 24:44.060* :  without being blocked by the earth. It's got many instruments but the two major instruments
*24:44.060- 24:49.600* :  are to take ultraviolet images of the sun, and then also there's a spectrograph that takes
*24:49.600- 24:55.000* :  spectra of the corona of the sun, which is ten times larger than the sun, and looks at the connection
*24:55.080- 24:59.500* :  between the surface of the sun and the corona of the sun, and so the idea is to monitor the sun
*24:59.500- 25:04.560* :  without a break. And what about the differences in heat between the surface and the corona? It's
*25:04.600- 25:10.340* :  observing the sun, going to help work out why it's such a big difference. Yeah, that's the other
*25:10.460- 25:16.200* :  thing. The sun's surface is 6,000 degrees, whereas the corona, which is just outside the sun's
*25:16.200- 25:22.280* :  surface, is a few million degrees, and how heat is transported out of the sun as it comes to us,
*25:22.420- 25:27.700* :  it passes through this region around the sun, full of charge particles, and it's so hot. So
*25:27.880- 25:32.060* :  this particular satellite has two instruments. They look at what's happening between the two,
*25:32.060- 25:37.120* :  so when a storm happens on the surface of the sun, one looks at immediately at the same time,
*25:37.200- 25:43.540* :  the effect on the corona itself, and from that study, one can figure out how the energy is being
*25:43.540- 25:49.500* :  exchanged. And for us here on Earth, what would you say apart from the scientific knowledge,
*25:49.500- 25:55.480* :  what is the direct relevance of this? What one studies is that over a period of 11 years,
*25:55.480- 26:00.780* :  the solar cycle, the sun gets very, very active. And in the active period, there are lots of
*26:00.780- 26:05.380* :  magnetic storms that happen on the surface of the sun. These storms can be as large as the earth,
*26:05.500- 26:10.360* :  and it produces millions of very energetic charge particles that are thrown out all over the
*26:10.360- 26:15.480* :  solar system. Around the earth, we have thousands and thousands of satellites. All of them have
*26:15.480- 26:20.120* :  sensitive computers and electronic equipment, and these particles have started to affect them,
*26:20.640- 26:26.160* :  and they can destroy them. These have been rather good months for the Indian Space Program in
*26:26.160- 26:30.900* :  general, haven't they? It's amazing to see first the moon mission, and then Aditya go up,
*26:31.140- 26:35.540* :  and then just on the 1st of January, the X-ray, Larimetric, satellite, X-Berside went up.
*26:35.780- 26:40.000* :  So all this has attracted so much public attention during the launch of both the moon mission,
*26:40.000- 26:46.100* :  and Aditya, school children, cheering as if they were watching a cricket match. Broadcasts were
*26:46.100- 26:51.000* :  watched by millions, hundreds of millions of people. Now I'm an educator also, right? Just to see
*26:51.000- 26:57.560* :  how my students are interested at the university level, but also this makes me hopeful that we'll get
*26:57.560- 27:01.400* :  a whole bunch of a new generation of students, high school students who are getting interested in
*27:01.400- 27:06.360* :  science and technology through missions like this, successes like this, and we will see a new
*27:06.360- 27:12.940* :  generation coming in to do science. Professor Somaak Ray Chaudhary talking to James Kumaris Sami.
*27:13.620- 27:19.080* :  With competition from Amazon and supermarkets, independent bookshops have not had it easy of late,
*27:19.520- 27:24.380* :  but here in the UK, the number of new independent booksellers is on the rise. In 2016,
*27:24.380- 27:33.080* :  they were 867. Today, they're nearly 1,100. Tom Rowley opened his bookshop here in London a year
*27:33.080- 27:37.360* :  ago, Sean Lay asked him what people thought of the idea. I suppose they think Britain's
*27:37.360- 27:42.960* :  more to bookshop is quite a sort of crusty old-fashioned thing these days, but actually it's quite
*27:42.960- 27:47.860* :  the reverse. Our average customer is in their 20s, they've grown up with, King Dublin,
*27:47.860- 27:53.440* :  they've grown up with social media and yet still, they love to come into a real physical bookshop,
*27:53.440- 27:58.580* :  browse the shelves, and often they'll pose with a stack of books and take a picture for their
*27:58.580- 28:03.920* :  Instagram and then tag all of their friends in it. As well as lots of books, there's something
*28:03.920- 28:09.580* :  else you can do in your bookshop. Oh yes, that's right, you can drink coffee during a day, wine
*28:09.580- 28:15.240* :  and beer and evening, and I must say we have discovered people tend to buy rather more books
*28:15.240- 28:20.640* :  after a king or two. That may have been something that traditional booksellers had failed to sport.
*28:20.780- 28:26.540* :  There are some interesting statistics that have come out which suggest that although there's
*28:26.540- 28:33.620* :  been a net decline, the independent bookshop openings last year, 2023, were higher than a year before.
*28:34.140- 28:38.900* :  That might surprise people because there are lots of high streets where they may not be a bookshop
*28:38.900- 28:45.720* :  as such at all. Yes, and I think the secret to it is community really, and that's what we're
*28:45.720- 28:51.040* :  offering as much as the chance to buy a book. I mean, that's why I call my bookshop back story
*28:51.420- 28:56.560* :  because anyone can buy any book they want online. What they're not going to get is the back story.
*28:56.560- 29:02.180* :  It's the opportunity to meet the author at an event or just kind of come out with a story of
*29:02.180- 29:07.540* :  their own. Often we found it because sort of spontaneous conversations at our barb, and so they're
*29:07.540- 29:11.720* :  coming out with a book but they're also coming out with a sort of story of their own. So it's a
*29:11.720- 29:19.160* :  community as much as a shop. I think that's right. We do our own magazine, we have music nights,
*29:19.160- 29:25.400* :  we do book subscriptions where we pick out books specifically for the person, and then we say
*29:25.400- 29:29.880* :  normally for cards, so they become pen pals about it, even if they don't give me a buy.
*29:30.220- 29:34.860* :  And it's a community for the team as well. I've got six booksellers and we go to the pub once a
*29:34.860- 29:39.400* :  month and we call it proofs and points. We talk about proofs that are coming up in the next few
*29:39.400- 29:43.620* :  months, the new books and which we are going to stock and which we're going to rave about.
*29:43.980- 29:49.620* :  Now that's a really interesting point, which we're going to stock. How important is that in booksellers
*29:49.820- 29:56.120* :  when you're up against top 10 book lists in supermarkets, you're up against mainstream news
*29:56.120- 30:03.440* :  agents? How difficult is it to kind of chart an independent course? It's absolutely vital. That's
*30:03.440- 30:09.380* :  wise from the work go, I want not just me, but the whole team to be involved in buying. We all
*30:09.380- 30:14.120* :  look at the catalogs and months in advance to decide what we want to stock. We're always writing
*30:14.120- 30:18.700* :  as little recommendation cards about what we like, about a particular book, and we try to just
*30:18.700- 30:24.280* :  have fun with our shelves at the front of the shop, rather than just having the same old displays,
*30:24.280- 30:29.820* :  the big book shops we'd have. So for instance, we had a display of overlooked books, we asked
*30:29.820- 30:34.760* :  customers to recommend books that they think are being unfairly overlooked over the years,
*30:35.120- 30:39.440* :  and we got them to write through little recommendations to each other. So it's making it a real
*30:39.440- 30:45.340* :  sort of experience rather than just the kind of transaction. Tom Roli talking to Sean Lay.
*30:46.220- 30:50.200* :  The people of Ghana have been making a name for themselves as world record challenges.
*30:50.740- 30:55.480* :  You may have heard about one woman's continuous singathon, which made headlines recently after
*30:55.480- 31:01.100* :  she ended up in hospital. Now another woman, Vailatu Abdul Razak, is trying to break the record
*31:01.100- 31:04.560* :  for continuous cooking. Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*31:07.500- 31:12.720* :  The distant sounds of music and drums coming from the hotel kitchen that's become home to
*31:12.720- 31:20.740* :  Vailatu Abdul Razak. No doubt helping it keep the chef awake as she enters her sixth day of
*31:20.740- 31:28.620* :  continuous cooking. On the menu, Joloff Rice and the traditional Bancou, a multipurpose white dough,
*31:28.620- 31:35.540* :  both of them labour intensive to make. The world record attempt had an original goal of getting past
*31:35.540- 31:43.700* :  the 190 hours and 57 minutes set by Irish chef Alan Fisher, but by Saturday morning,
*31:43.700- 31:51.000* :  Vailatu had reportedly surpassed that mark and upped her target to 240 hours.
*31:51.700- 31:57.600* :  That was much to the excitement of her fans who'd gathered to watch, sing, dance and of course eat.
*32:05.960- 32:10.780* :  The former first lady visited the hotel in Tamale to cheer Vailatu on,
*32:10.780- 32:17.200* :  a visit that left the exhausted chef in tears of joy. The rule set by Guinness World Record
*32:17.200- 32:23.760* :  State, she's only allowed a five minute break every hour or to take a full hour break after a
*32:23.760- 32:29.600* :  12 hour stretch of cooking. Something anyone who's cooked Christmas lunch can perhaps relate to,
