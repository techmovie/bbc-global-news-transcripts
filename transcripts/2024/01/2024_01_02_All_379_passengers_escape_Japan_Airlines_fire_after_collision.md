*01:13.260- 01:19.820* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the second of January these are our main stories
*01:20.420- 01:27.060* :  and incredible escape for 379 passengers as their Japan Airways jet collides with another plane
*01:27.060- 01:32.840* :  at a Tokyo airport and then bursts into flames. Five people died on the other aircraft which was
*01:32.840- 01:37.460* :  a Coast Guard plane preparing to help with relief for the New Year's Day earthquake which is
*01:37.460- 01:44.660* :  killed at least 48 people. Fury in Somalia as Ethiopia strikes a port access deal which effectively
*01:44.660- 01:52.560* :  recognizes breakaway Somali land. Also in this podcast women's world cup winner Jenny Amoso

*01:58.460- 02:04.560* :  and we hear about the 16 year old world championship dart sensation everyone is talking about.
*02:04.960- 02:09.380* :  When he turned up to play darts they were saying no not in again. When he was 12 there was
*02:09.380- 02:15.240* :  had to find a plane because it was too good. Luke Littler takes on Rob Cross in the semi finals later today.
*02:17.880- 02:25.180* :  We start in Japan where all 379 passengers and crew have incredibly escaped with their lives
*02:25.180- 02:30.840* :  after the Japan Airlines jet they were on collided with another plane on landing at Tokyo's Anita
*02:30.840- 02:36.680* :  Airport. The footage of the accident shows the rear of the airline are trailing a fireball as
*02:36.680- 02:41.880* :  it slows to a stop which quickly engulfs the back half of the jet the blaze then spread
*02:41.880- 02:46.900* :  to the rest of the plane. Five of the six people aboard the other plane a Coast Guard aircraft
*02:46.900- 02:51.620* :  were killed. They were on their way to help with rescue efforts after the earthquake that struck
*02:51.620- 02:57.920* :  the Ishikawa Prefecture on New Year's Day. A reporter Sir and Janna Tawari is at the airport.
*02:58.600- 03:04.540* :  It's been three hour since the collision and firefighters have finally managed to control the blaze
*03:04.600- 03:11.720* :  on that Japan Airlines aircraft. I can't say there's much less of the aircraft. It's completely
*03:11.720- 03:17.400* :  charred and there is still one plume of smoke coming from it. There's quite a bit of a dozen
*03:17.400- 03:24.720* :  fire trucks around it continuing to monitor it and it's really caused a lot of disruption here
*03:24.720- 03:31.300* :  at Anita Airport. Japan's busiest airport the four runways are shut and no planes are coming in
*03:31.300- 03:37.420* :  or going out. So many passengers stranded here as you mentioned five out of the six passengers on
*03:37.420- 03:44.700* :  the smaller aircraft that the Japan Airlines plane collided with have unfortunately died. However,
*03:44.700- 03:50.140* :  more than 270 passengers on the Japan Airlines site did manage to escape which is quite
*03:50.140- 03:54.620* :  miraculous given the size of the blaze and the time it took to overwhelm the aircraft.
*03:55.120- 04:00.780* :  Yeah that really is the story isn't it because the pictures of that fire initially half the aircraft
*04:01.340- 04:05.520* :  engulfed with flames coming out of the window that then the entire thing but it does seem
*04:05.520- 04:11.580* :  extraordinary that everyone aboard that aircraft apparently got off safely. That's right. I mean we've
*04:11.580- 04:17.240* :  seen some amateur video of chaos and confusion when they were trying to get off the plane naturally
*04:17.240- 04:25.140* :  but actually when the plane was approaching the tarmac it left a huge fireball behind it which
*04:25.140- 04:31.540* :  must have been the coast guards plane and the passenger plane was on fire when it landed but that
*04:31.540- 04:36.680* :  fire seemed to be quite isolated initially and it seemed like it was going to get under control
*04:36.680- 04:43.240* :  very quickly but very quickly it's in a very short space of time and it just engulfed the entire
*04:43.240- 04:50.060* :  plane and the fire trucks were just unable to control the blaze and the entire fuselage was just
*04:50.060- 04:55.300* :  stripped back with that fire. And that's understanding this is the first accident involving an
*04:55.300- 05:01.840* :  Airbus A350. Japan has a very strong safety record especially when it comes to transport and
*05:01.940- 05:06.460* :  an expert actually told the BBC that it was credit to the crew that they managed to get the
*05:06.460- 05:12.260* :  passengers off in such a short space of time because of training and stringent procedures.
*05:12.680- 05:18.360* :  Depends Prime Minister has said that this incident is going to be investigated very carefully
*05:18.360- 05:23.840* :  and procedures are going to be put in place as a result of them. It's not clear what caused
*05:23.840- 05:30.460* :  the collision the close guard plane was going to join rescue efforts and for the earthquake
*05:30.460- 05:39.180* :  that struck Japan just over 24 hours before this collision. Surinjana Tawari at that airport in Tokyo.
*05:40.180- 05:45.780* :  Well Japan is still trying to recover from the devastating effects of the earthquake on Monday.
*05:45.780- 05:50.540* :  It has one of the world's most sophisticated early warning systems which meant that thousands
*05:50.540- 05:56.200* :  of people managed to leave the area safely. However the race is now on to find people believe to be
*05:56.200- 06:01.580* :  buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Rescue efforts being hampered by damage to the roads.
*06:01.580- 06:07.440* :  Our correspondent Jean McKenzie is on the ground on the notepad insular trying to travel towards
*06:07.440- 06:13.740* :  the epicenter and sent this report. We've arrived at the small peninsula where the earthquake happened
*06:13.880- 06:20.420* :  and we are traveling towards the epicenter and we keep coming across these areas of destruction
*06:21.020- 06:25.920* :  where homes have been partially destroyed or some of them completely collapsed. Now they tend
*06:25.920- 06:31.460* :  to be these older homes that are made of wood. The houses that haven't been built to withstand
*06:31.460- 06:38.020* :  these sort of earthquakes. We are trying to get closer to the epicenter to a city where we know
*06:38.020- 06:42.720* :  that at least a dozen people have been killed and many more are trapped in their homes because
*06:42.720- 06:48.340* :  they have completely collapsed but we're struggling to get there because we keep coming up against
*06:48.400- 06:54.340* :  these roads that are just totally inaccessible and we know that the rescue teams are also struggling
*06:54.340- 06:59.840* :  to reach these worst affected areas where people are trapped in their homes. This has been a terrifying
*06:59.840- 07:07.600* :  day and night for people because the memories of that earthquake here in 2011 and the huge tsunami
*07:07.600- 07:13.460* :  that followed that killed nearly 20,000 people. Those memories are still so fresh in people's minds
*07:14.120- 07:18.920* :  and then you have the constant aftershocks that we've been having since yesterday afternoon
*07:19.360- 07:24.420* :  and the authorities are warning that there might be more major aftershocks in the days to come.
*07:25.000- 07:31.640* :  What this earthquake has done is remind people here just how vulnerable they are to these disasters.
*07:32.520- 07:38.880* :  Gene McKenzie. South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-mi-ung has been stabbed in the neck
*07:39.060- 07:41.780* :  during a walk-about with journalists in the city of Busan.
*07:42.580- 07:45.220* :  In a case of an accident, how was it?
*07:55.720- 08:01.160* :  Mr Lee was struck in the juggler vein, although the wound is not considered life-threatening.
*08:01.160- 08:07.000* :  A man has been arrested in connection with the assault. The BBC's Rachel Lee in Seoul told me
*08:07.000- 08:11.920* :  a little more about what happened. He was there to visit a construction site in the
*08:11.920- 08:17.100* :  port of Busan on Tuesday morning. When the stabbing happened, he was stabbed on the left side of his
*08:17.100- 08:23.060* :  neck and was transferred to a hospital about 20 minutes after the attack. The attacker's weapon
*08:23.060- 08:29.540* :  is reportedly to be about 20 to 30 centimeters long. Mr Lee sustained a one centimeter
*08:29.540- 08:36.140* :  elaceration and received treatment while conscious according to reports. Democratic Party spokesman
*08:36.140- 08:41.780* :  said that the medical staff suspected injury to his juggler vein, which carries blood from the
*08:41.780- 08:46.760* :  head to the heart. Now, the police stated that his wound is not life-threatening and currently
*08:46.940- 08:53.920* :  Mr Lee is hospitalized in Seoul National University Hospital, which is one of the biggest hospital in
*08:53.920- 08:59.760* :  Seoul. But no idea of motive. Seoul's police bureau is currently under investigation in this matter.
*08:59.760- 09:06.780* :  The attacker, what we know right now, is a man in his 60s and he's being investigated as being
*09:06.780- 09:11.920* :  accused of attempted murder as he reportedly told the police that he did it to kill Mr Lee.
*09:12.380- 09:19.080* :  He alleged approached Mr Lee asking for an autograph before suddenly lunging forward to stab him.
*09:19.420- 09:23.620* :  The attacker, the police said, had purchased the weapon he used last year on the internet,
*09:23.620- 09:30.140* :  but found no crime record of him. Rachel Lee in Seoul, there's been another huge barrage of
*09:30.140- 09:35.560* :  rockets sent over Russia's frontier and into Ukraine. The Ukrainian said four people were killed in
*09:35.560- 09:40.960* :  the latest bombardment. These attacks came just hours after President Putin said his troops would
*09:40.960- 09:46.900* :  be intensifying attacks. The Mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko, recorded a video in which he
*09:47.180- 09:55.740* :  described the damage to one part of the Capitol. Another brutal attack on our city,
*09:55.980- 10:02.400* :  Solanyansky District, a large crater is behind me. A rocket fragment landed 10 meters away from
*10:02.400- 10:08.720* :  the house. The apartment block is damaged. All residents are now evacuated, one elderly woman
*10:08.720- 10:14.560* :  on the way to the hospital, unfortunately, died from her injuries. Everyone is being provided with
*10:14.560- 10:20.680* :  medical assistance now. We're going to inspect this house now. After that, we will give more
*10:20.680- 10:26.520* :  information regarding the next steps. I ask the BBC's James Waterhouse in Kiev about these latest
*10:26.520- 10:32.760* :  attacks. Ukrainians typically don't like seeing or hearing that in their Putin on TV, but his
*10:32.760- 10:37.620* :  words were hard to ignore last night when he vowed to intensify attacks on what he called
*10:37.620- 10:44.000* :  military sites in Ukraine. Sure enough, from about 2 a.m., the air aid sirens sounded.
*10:44.820- 10:50.980* :  The air defenses were working hard to repel what were initially Russian-launched drones and then
*10:50.980- 10:58.240* :  this morning missiles then came in. There were fighter jets launched as well. It was an all-out
*10:58.240- 11:04.700* :  aerial assault last night in a week where really things have ramped up in that regard. Where
*11:05.440- 11:09.920* :  Mayor Kitchko was, we've just been to. I mean, that's quite a central neighborhood. These strikes
*11:09.920- 11:17.060* :  are becoming more and more central. The damage is enormous and it is probable that Vladimir Putin
*11:17.060- 11:22.320* :  is targeting military areas. We've seen evidence of that. But what is inescapable,
*11:22.660- 11:30.260* :  undeniable is the fact that it is civilian areas, spaces, homes, hospitals that are targeted
*11:31.140- 11:35.860* :  or at best hit as well. Not just in Kiev overnight, but Hardikiv as well, which was also
*11:36.440- 11:40.440* :  targeted. And I think the timing is significant as well because it was feared
*11:41.080- 11:46.260* :  Russia was stockpiling missiles. Those fears are being realized in the scale of the attacks we're
*11:46.260- 11:52.680* :  seeing. But the air defense systems tested in this way rely on Western support to be replenished
*11:52.680- 11:58.580* :  in the long term. And the last U.S. approved package has arrived no more a schedule to arrive for
*11:58.580- 12:02.280* :  now. So it's a critical time. And a furious response from President Zelensky.
*12:03.100- 12:09.180* :  President Zelensky has again condemned these attacks. And if you look at the recent messaging
*12:09.180- 12:16.500* :  coming from him, he is looking inward now. He is looking at trying to make Ukraine more self-sufficient
*12:16.500- 12:24.180* :  in the face of this uncertain forecast, if you like, of future Western support. He's trying to
*12:24.180- 12:30.280* :  boost military development. He's trying to, you know, meet drone manufacturing targets.
*12:30.920- 12:35.140* :  But the scenes we are seeing now in Kiev, I certainly hadn't seen since the first days and weeks
*12:35.140- 12:40.900* :  of the initial full-scale invasion. The aim for Russia is to lessen people's desire to fight.
*12:40.900- 12:43.860* :  What it does do is certainly makes people angry.
*12:43.860- 12:52.320* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev. Next to an escalating diplomatic dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia.
*12:52.320- 12:57.920* :  It centers on the breakaway territory of Somali land, which is not recognized internationally
*12:57.920- 13:03.720* :  as an independent state, but as part of Somalia. On Monday, Ethiopia said it was signing an agreement
*13:03.720- 13:09.660* :  with Somali land to use one of its ports, a move that could enable landlocked Ethiopia to gain
*13:09.660- 13:15.420* :  access to the sea. That's prompted an angry reaction from the Somali government, which today
*13:15.420- 13:22.060* :  said it was withdrawing its ambassador to Ethiopia. Somalia's Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barry promised
*13:22.060- 13:31.340* :  to protect the country's borders. I want to urge the Somali people to calm down. I want to
*13:31.340- 13:36.160* :  assure them we are committed to defending our country. No part of our land, our sea and our
*13:36.160- 13:41.440* :  air can be violated, and we will defend it in every legal way. And I'm sure that with the help
*13:41.440- 13:45.860* :  of our people, whether they are in the north or in the south, we are able to defend our country.
*13:46.160- 13:49.800* :  Our correspondent, Kalkadhan Yibaltal, is in Addis Ababa.
*13:50.360- 13:55.360* :  The details are still sketchy, but the Ethiopian authorities have said that they have signed
*13:55.360- 14:00.400* :  this deal that would allow them to have access to the Red Sea, but they haven't said much,
*14:00.400- 14:05.160* :  and most of the detail that we're having is coming from the Somali land side. The officials
*14:05.160- 14:12.080* :  in Somali learn said that Ethiopia will have 20 kilometers of coastal lines on the Red Sea,
*14:12.080- 14:18.700* :  where it will build a military base, use it as such for 50 years, while Ethiopia in an exchange
*14:18.700- 14:24.120* :  will recognize Somali land as a sovereign state. Kalkadhan Yibaltal.
*14:24.980- 14:32.020* :  Now to Portugal to remote off the grid southern Portugal. Former BBC correspondent Alistair
*14:32.020- 14:37.560* :  Leithhead and his wife Anna have given up their globe-trotting careers in journalism and diplomacy
*14:37.560- 14:44.700* :  to set themselves a new challenge to create a home off the grid deep in rural Alatejo in Portugal.
*14:44.700- 14:50.640* :  They're exploring what goes into creating a small sustainable hotel when you need to generate
*14:50.640- 14:58.020* :  your own power and extract and purify your own water. And despite no prior experience, he's giving
*14:58.020- 15:04.620* :  you to try. My previous career was as a foreign correspondent for the BBC. Now myself and my wife Anna
*15:04.620- 15:13.160* :  are living here in Portugal and faced with quite a different challenge. It's a crucial point in
*15:13.160- 15:19.000* :  our construction. And our water consultant, Rui, is on site explaining to the builder why we need
*15:19.000- 15:24.220* :  three different types of water pipes going into each of our three new buildings, one for the toilet,
*15:24.220- 15:29.900* :  the shower and for drinking water. Because the less treatment we do, the less power we use,
*15:29.900- 15:35.740* :  and the less waste there is. Well, I don't eat next to Zanya, so on this drawing I've got everything
*15:35.740- 15:42.100* :  down because I was a student that we added like this. It's not the traditional way of doing things here.
*15:42.100- 15:48.840* :  But relying on mineral rich boreholes and rainwater is the only way to guarantee all the water we need.
*15:49.840- 15:54.780* :  So my name is Rui Faria and for the last 20 years I've been working with independent systems
*15:54.780- 16:00.640* :  for water treatment, wastewater treatment. Off-grid is the biggest part of it. And in some cases,
*16:00.640- 16:07.520* :  like your project here, you have neither treated water, neither public sewage. So to be off-grid
*16:07.540- 16:15.180* :  here in a project like this, we have to be self-supported in having your water treated
*16:16.120- 16:23.220* :  and your wastewater also treated. As a regular consumer, water is just something that comes out of
*16:23.220- 16:28.020* :  the tap. And that's what it is. That's my wife Anna. To move here, we both give apart jobs,
*16:28.020- 16:34.040* :  which have nothing to do with water. This is actually the most central part for our living here.
*16:34.440- 16:39.260* :  And it's been really, really useful. It's been a journey of learning how much water we actually
*16:39.260- 16:45.540* :  consume versus how much water do we actually need to consume and how can we actually be sustainable
*16:45.540- 16:51.300* :  about it in our daily lives because it's central to our work. It's central to our project and we
*16:51.300- 16:58.520* :  really need it. Problems with salt and with minerals and iron and that's pretty much we've got
*16:58.520- 17:02.580* :  all of it, haven't we? Indeed. And just make quite a challenge.
*17:02.820- 17:07.060* :  Indeed. And just to make the recipe complete, you also have lots of calcium in the water,
*17:07.060- 17:13.660* :  so the water is very hard. And we only realize how difficult it is when we have to face it that way.
*17:14.160- 17:18.260* :  Because for us, it's the cost of the equipment to start with, the filtering iron and
*17:18.260- 17:24.040* :  reverse osmosis for salt. Then it's the waste, which is what maybe even half is wasted when it
*17:24.040- 17:28.680* :  goes through the system. And as you say, dealing with waste on the top of a hill, where does it
*17:28.680- 17:33.120* :  all go? And because we're off grid, we haven't got the power to do all this stuff whenever it
*17:33.120- 17:38.660* :  wants to do it. Everything we're doing is based around trying to only run pumps when we want
*17:38.660- 17:45.700* :  them to, which is when the sun's shining. With this, we can use the unfiltered water to flush the
*17:45.700- 17:53.600* :  toilets because nobody is going to drink or take water out of the toilet. That's not kind of
*17:53.600- 17:59.300* :  guests we're looking to attract. Exactly. We've had a lot of sleepless nights getting to this point,
*17:59.300- 18:04.040* :  most of them about water, but also whether we'd get alone from the tourism authority,
*18:04.040- 18:11.080* :  permissions, finding a builder, then inflation. Three buildings and an infinity pool with wine
*18:11.080- 18:17.520* :  cellar are now built here on the hill. Windows and the polished concrete floors are next. Project
*18:17.520- 18:23.280* :  managing construction is always difficult, but even harder when the whole water and electrical
*18:23.280- 18:28.760* :  infrastructure has to be installed. Well, it's been a real challenge getting our heads around this,
*18:29.380- 18:34.920* :  but we have a couple of things we keep telling ourselves. One of them is every day is a school day,
*18:34.920- 18:40.660* :  and what's the other one love? If this was easy, everyone would do it. It's not that easy, is it?
*18:40.820- 18:47.320* :  It's really hard. Final question, how's the budget looking? We're almost at budget, but a bit over.

*19:08.680- 19:13.180* :  it's got an elongated snout, absolutely enormous jaws.

*20:24.700- 20:30.720* :  The Hamas Run Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 22,000 Palestinians have now been killed
*20:30.720- 20:36.260* :  since the start of Israel's military campaign. The conflict between Israel and Hamas
*20:36.640- 20:41.560* :  is poised to enter a new phase with the Israeli military announcing a withdrawal of some of its
*20:41.560- 20:46.960* :  forces from Gaza this month. So how's that being viewed in Washington? My colleague Martha
*20:46.960- 20:51.580* :  Carney has been talking to one of the most respected military figures in the United States.
*20:52.000- 20:57.620* :  General David Petraeus, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq and was director of the CIA.
*20:58.620- 21:02.920* :  Well, it depends which part of the United States. There are certain parts in the administration,
*21:03.020- 21:11.160* :  of course, that have been urging for Israel to refine what it's doing in Gaza.
*21:12.020- 21:18.380* :  But there will be others, and I would be among them who will ask how will this affect Israel's
*21:18.380- 21:24.380* :  ability to accomplish its overriding mission, which is of course to destroy Hamas, dismantle the
*21:24.380- 21:31.640* :  political wing of Hamas and to rescue all of the Israeli and other hostages that Hamas holds.
*21:32.860- 21:40.600* :  And for that, Israel still has to clear and hold all of Gaza. How will this latest decision
*21:40.600- 21:47.240* :  affect Israel's ability to carry that mission out? And what is the vision for the Palestinian
*21:47.240- 21:55.180* :  people in Gaza? Once Hamas has been destroyed and the Hamas political wing has been disassembled.
*21:55.360- 22:01.360* :  Although you have heard the arguments that this mission by Israel to try to destroy Hamas is coming
*22:02.240- 22:07.540* :  to a higher price because of the numbers of civilian casualties, and also in the end might be
*22:07.940- 22:14.080* :  counterproductive because it's radicalizing future generations who may go on to join Hamas fighters.
*22:15.080- 22:19.440* :  It's a very legitimate concern. We always had a sign on the command post
*22:20.640- 22:25.020* :  where I was published a command, for example, during the surge in Iraq or the surge in Afghanistan
*22:25.020- 22:29.980* :  that asked a question that was always staring at us. Will this operation take more bad guys off
*22:29.980- 22:35.500* :  the street than it creates by its conduct? And if the answer to that is no, you have to
*22:35.500- 22:40.780* :  rescope the operation. You have to determine how you can get to yes. And certainly there have been
*22:41.560- 22:47.060* :  a number of instances, I think, so far where in hindsight at least the answer to that question
*22:47.060- 22:51.620* :  was no. General David Petraeus, speaking to my colleague, Martha Carney.
*22:52.660- 22:57.680* :  The American rock band Green Day have often been outspoken about Donald Trump.
*22:57.680- 23:02.540* :  Despite his numerous legal woes, the former president is leading the race to represent the
*23:02.540- 23:08.580* :  Republicans in this year's US election, which might be why the band used eight New Year's Eve
*23:08.580- 23:14.080* :  TV performance to change the lyrics of one of their best-known songs, American Idiot,
*23:14.680- 23:15.960* :  as Paddy McGuire reports.
*23:21.220- 23:26.300* :  Released in 2004 on the album of the same name, which has sold 12 million copies worldwide.
*23:29.200- 23:33.800* :  The song American Idiot was originally written to criticise the policies of the then-president
*23:33.800- 23:40.000* :  George W. Bush, his response to the terror attacks of 9-11 and the American media.
*23:40.500- 23:44.740* :  This isn't the first time the band has altered the lyrics of the song to have a dig at the right.
*23:44.740- 23:50.320* :  But when Green Day took to the stage on the ABC show Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve
*23:50.380- 23:55.960* :  with Ryan Seacrest, the front-man Billy Joe Armstrong used the opportunity to swap the words from this.
*23:59.060- 24:01.720* :  I'm not part of a redneck agenda to this.
*24:05.580- 24:11.420* :  I'm not part of the MAGA agenda. Green Day has had a go at Donald Trump and his supporters before.
*24:11.420- 24:16.140* :  This is what they had to say when they played at the American Music Award in 2016.
*24:16.140- 24:22.300* :  The year he was elected president and coined the phrase make America great again or MAGA.
*24:30.220- 24:35.600* :  After this latest jab, Trump fans quickly hit back on social media, some called Green Day
*24:35.600- 24:40.740* :  irrelevant and lame. Others, perhaps not aware of the band being so politically outspoken,
*24:41.140- 24:46.000* :  accuse them of selling out. Green Day may turn out to be the least of Donald Trump's concerns.
*24:46.700- 24:52.300* :  Maine recently became the second US state to disqualify him from contesting the Republican primaries,
*24:52.700- 24:57.480* :  citing a constitutional insurrection clause because of his actions leading up to the capital
*24:57.480- 25:04.320* :  riot in 2021. How that, along with the criminal charges he faces over his attempt to overturn his
*25:04.320- 25:10.840* :  defeat at the last elections plays out, remains to be seen. The Spanish football player,
*25:10.840- 25:17.000* :  Jenny Amoso, has appeared in court in Madrid as part of an investigation into Luis Rubiales,
*25:17.000- 25:22.780* :  the former president of Spain's football federation. Mr. Rubiales could face trial for sexual
*25:22.780- 25:29.020* :  assault for kissing Amoso on the lips after the Spanish women's team won the World Cup in August.
*25:29.020- 25:35.120* :  Guy Hegeco reports from Madrid. In her court appearance, Yeniette Moso is reported to have
*25:35.120- 25:40.480* :  repeated her assertion that when Mr. Rubiales kissed her, he did so without her consent.
*25:40.480- 25:46.720* :  A claim he contests. This was the final hearing in this probe, which will decide whether Mr.
*25:46.720- 25:52.680* :  Rubiales goes on trial for sexual assault. The controversy overshadowed the Spanish team's World
*25:52.680- 25:58.580* :  Cup win and led to a major shake-up within the football federation. It also triggered a broader
*25:58.580- 26:06.460* :  movement against sexism in other areas of Spanish society. Guy Hegeco. Now, we all love an
*26:06.460- 26:12.820* :  underdog story and this is one everyone is talking about here in the UK. He's known as
*26:13.180- 26:20.620* :  Luke the Newc Littleer with plenty of justification. The 16-year-old in his first ever World Darts
*26:20.620- 26:27.300* :  Championship is on his way to the semi-finals after beating a player three times his age. Luke says,
*26:27.340- 26:32.980* :  it's crazy watching myself at 18 months or two years old in a nappy, but it has all paid off.
*26:35.180- 26:37.180* :  You're going to get me at 180.
*26:43.480- 26:48.960* :  On Monday, Luke sent fans wild at Alexandra Palace in London before speaking to reporters
*26:48.960- 26:51.760* :  about his chances of winning the whole tournament.
*26:58.000- 27:01.780* :  Unbelievable. I've said no, I've got the ability to go all the way, but
*27:02.180- 27:06.360* :  if it's not to be tomorrow night, then it's not to be, but whatever Luke let's turn up, then
*27:06.360- 27:12.420* :  as well as Carl Holden is the co-founder of the St. Helen's Darts Academy where Luke
*27:12.420- 27:16.780* :  honed his skills. He was only nine years of age when the first come to the Darts Academy.
*27:17.360- 27:22.560* :  Could you tell he was so talented at that young age? Pretty quickly, you see, he was a bit better
*27:22.560- 27:27.780* :  than all of the kids under 10, she was there, then obviously he developed, went into the next
*27:28.260- 27:32.800* :  section, then he went up to the under 14s elite, and within a year he actually was playing in the
*27:32.800- 27:38.560* :  under 21s at his age, just before he's 11th birthday, which is something we'd never witnessed before,
*27:38.560- 27:42.860* :  so he's always been something different here. Very different, and it must have been very
*27:42.860- 27:47.920* :  strange for the older kids having this tiny 11-year-old coming off against the big humiliating.
*27:48.620- 27:53.140* :  We were starting to look at the bigger picture and to the top, you know, like in the pubs or clubs
*27:53.140- 27:57.540* :  at any time, you can't forget more experience. It was just great people in my town.
*27:57.700- 28:01.980* :  When he turned up to play Darts, they would say no, not him again. When he was 12,
*28:01.980- 28:05.900* :  he was terrified of playing him because he was too good, and it's pretty funny.
*28:06.340- 28:10.880* :  And it's not just though being such a good player, is it? There's something about his
*28:11.360- 28:16.260* :  coolness, isn't there under pressure? Yeah, that is about pressure. I mean, I was watching
*28:16.260- 28:20.980* :  Rob Cross's today in that play, and it looked like he was going to lose 5-0, and then he ends up
*28:20.980- 28:26.240* :  winning 5-4, and right at the end, you could see both plays snatching and pulling, and it's
*28:26.240- 28:29.920* :  that sheer pressure. When you're under pressure, it's much harder to play on that stage, but Luke
*28:30.520- 28:34.900* :  looks to suck it really well at the moment. He's not been under any serious pressure. I think
*28:34.900- 28:38.920* :  he will be with Rob Cross. He's one of the best plays in the world. This is his biggest task here,
*28:39.260- 28:43.280* :  but again, if he plays there again, he's got a really good chance to beat Rob.
*28:43.540- 28:49.440* :  And he really seems to enjoy the atmosphere and the crowds, doesn't he? Turned at one point and say,
*28:49.440- 28:55.000* :  should I try to win the leg with the bulls eye? Yeah, he's done a few times for edge 16,
*28:55.000- 29:00.100* :  not many get in that position, but he loves it, you know, he's a pentatainer as well, you know,
*29:00.100- 29:04.760* :  edge 16, he's he's the last few years, he's developed that path in his game, you know, where he's
*29:04.760- 29:09.260* :  he's done crazy things, and I've seen him on the check out there, and he looks at the score,
*29:09.260- 29:15.900* :  and he'll go 5-18, double 16, and he works it out, he's very clever on that stage and under that
*29:15.900- 29:21.100* :  board. How'd you rate his chances to win the semi-final, even the championship? He's got the
*29:21.100- 29:25.820* :  ability to do it, and all the else has got his ability, I don't think anybody under the age of
*29:25.860- 29:32.560* :  21's got the ability to reach the semi-final, so I think he's about 50-50 to win it to be honest
*29:32.560- 29:38.540* :  with you, we'll find out tonight. And that is incredible, it's given his age, Carl Holden
*29:38.540- 29:45.080* :  there speaking to Martha Carney. To news of a giant sea predator, so large that it's been called
*29:45.080- 29:51.080* :  the Sea Rex, an underwater version of T-Rex, the skull of this prehistoric creature was recently
*29:51.080- 29:56.820* :  unearthed on the south coast of England. Today it's gone on display for the public for the first time.
*29:56.820- 30:03.480* :  Our science editor Rebecca Morrell is at the museum in Dorset in southwest England and told us more.
*30:04.480- 30:12.120* :  This is a colossal fossil, it's the skull of a sea creature called a plyosaur, it is two meters
*30:12.120- 30:17.960* :  long, absolutely enormous, and you can see it's huge jaws, I mean it's a bit like a crocodile on
*30:17.960- 30:24.640* :  steroids and they are packed with dozens of these razor sharp teeth, this would have been a killing
*30:24.640- 30:30.560* :  machine, it would have eaten anything it got its jaws into and probably killed it off with a single
*30:30.560- 30:37.000* :  bite. Now it lived 150 million years ago about the same time that dinosaurs were roaming the land,
*30:37.000- 30:43.940* :  this thing would have been terrorising the ocean and it is a beautifully preserved fossil, so
*30:44.260- 30:50.500* :  the smell of it, the tip of its nose was found by a fossil enthusiast who was walking along
*30:50.500- 30:58.000* :  Kimmeridge Bay in Dorset and he discovered that and then he told Steve Etchis who's museum,
*30:58.000- 31:03.540* :  this is now in about it, who then realised that the rest of its skull, the rest of this enormous
*31:03.540- 31:09.920* :  skull was in a cliff, so the team excavated it, dangling from ropes half way down a crumbling
*31:09.920- 31:14.940* :  cliff face to get this thing out, then it took about ten months to actually prepare it to get rid
*31:14.940- 31:21.280* :  of all the clay and earth around it until finally this beautiful fossil emerged. Now it is such
*31:22.020- 31:28.080* :  a fantastically preserved specimen and scientists think it's also perhaps a species that's
*31:28.080- 31:33.480* :  new to science too but there might be a bit more of this beast to come because the team thinks
*31:33.480- 31:37.380* :  the rest of its body which is about another ten metres, so this thing would have been the size of
*31:37.380- 31:41.600* :  a double deck of us, they think it may still be buried in the cliffs here.
*31:43.720- 31:49.680* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later,
*31:49.680- 31:56.060* :  if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email,
