*01:09.300- 01:16.260* :  Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:16.260- 01:21.420* :  the 9th of January, these are our main stories. The American Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*01:21.420- 01:27.160* :  who's in Israel, has said that it's not in the interests of any country to see the Gaza conflict
*01:27.160- 01:32.820* :  escalate. The French Prime Minister, Elizabeth Bourne, has stepped down as President Macron
*01:32.820- 01:38.100* :  tries to revive his embattled government. One of the legends of international football,
*01:38.100- 01:45.440* :  France Beckombauer, has died at the age of 78. Also in this podcast,
*01:45.440- 01:51.740* :  some backwales are extremely diverse vocalists, and one of the more common calls that we see
*01:51.740- 01:55.180* :  throughout the world is one of these low-frequency sort of broad-spectrum,
*01:55.180- 02:02.260* :  throt or what-call. We speak to the scientists, you say they have been talking to a humpback whale.
*02:06.900- 02:12.800* :  As fears rise, the war in Gaza could escalate into a wider, middle-east conflict.
*02:12.800- 02:18.520* :  The U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has been visiting Arab nations trying to calm
*02:18.520- 02:23.200* :  the rising tensions. On Monday, the Lebanese group, Hasbollah, said one of its commanders
*02:23.200- 02:29.840* :  had been killed in a suspected Israeli strike. Mr. Blinken, who is now in Israel, urged restraint.
*02:30.760- 02:36.640* :  It's clearly not in the interest of anyone. Israel, Lebanon, Hasbollah for that matter,
*02:37.400- 02:43.840* :  to see this escalate and to see an actual conflict. And the Israelis have been very clear with us
*02:43.840- 02:49.940* :  that they want to find a diplomatic way forward. The Hasbollah commander killed in Lebanon has
*02:49.940- 02:55.380* :  been named as Wissam Al-Tawil, while Israel has not confirmed it carried out the killing,
*02:55.380- 02:59.420* :  a government spokesman warned Hasbollah to back off.
*03:19.900- 03:25.460* :  Since the Hamas attacks on October 7, as well as the devastating war in Gaza,
*03:25.660- 03:31.280* :  there have been nearly daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hasbollah forces in Lebanon.
*03:32.120- 03:37.820* :  The death of this Hasbollah commander comes a week after another Israeli strike on Lebanon
*03:37.820- 03:43.720* :  killed a senior Hamas leader there. Our correspondent in Beirut, Hugo Besheger, told us what
*03:43.720- 03:49.800* :  is known about this latest killing. Hasbollah hasn't really given details about the role that
*03:50.220- 03:57.340* :  this commander played with some Al-Tawil. Reports here suggest he was a senior commander of the
*03:57.340- 04:04.220* :  group's Radwan force and that he was killed in an Israeli drone strike in southern Lebanon.
*04:04.360- 04:10.960* :  And Hasbollah has published a picture of him alongside leader Hassan Nasrallah. So this shows that
*04:10.960- 04:16.260* :  he was a prominent figure, a significant figure inside the group. And I think he's the most
*04:16.260- 04:23.360* :  senior Hasbollah officer killed so far in this wave of violence between Hasbollah and Israel.
*04:24.000- 04:29.200* :  Now, Israel hasn't confirmed it was behind the killing. The military said he had carried out
*04:29.200- 04:35.480* :  attacks targeting Hasbollah positions in southern Lebanon today in response to attacks that had
*04:35.480- 04:41.320* :  been carried out by the group. And I think this shows how tense the situation is along the
*04:41.320- 04:47.780* :  Lebanon-Israel border. And the fear here in Lebanon is that this violence could escalate and
*04:47.780- 04:53.360* :  this could become a major conflict between Hasbollah and Israel. Yes, that is a big fear. And we saw
*04:53.360- 05:01.340* :  last week an Israeli strike on Lebanon which killed a senior Hamas leader. Now this week we're
*05:01.340- 05:08.320* :  hearing that Israel may have been behind the death of this Hasbollah commander. Why would Israel
*05:08.320- 05:12.420* :  be carrying out such attacks given the fears about this conflict escalating?
*05:12.900- 05:19.160* :  So in Israel, you know, some senior officials have been defending a larger offensive against
*05:19.160- 05:24.640* :  Hasbollah to try to stop these attacks, to reduce the threat posed by Hasbollah, which is this
*05:24.640- 05:30.800* :  powerful organization supported by Iran. And also to allow the return of tens of thousands of
*05:30.800- 05:34.860* :  residents who have been evacuated from northern Israel because of these attacks that have been
*05:34.860- 05:41.080* :  happening almost every day. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today was in northern Israel
*05:41.080- 05:48.600* :  saying essentially that the Israeli military is ready for a confrontation with Hasbollah. The Israeli
*05:48.600- 05:57.380* :  defense minister as well has said that it is imperative to restore security in northern Israel
*05:57.380- 06:04.380* :  and that these attacks from Hasbollah need to stop. So you do have some people in Israel
*06:04.380- 06:11.260* :  defending a much stronger approach when it comes to Hasbollah to try to stop these attacks from
*06:11.260- 06:17.640* :  the group. You go, Bashaker. Well, as we mentioned earlier, the US's top diplomat, Antony Blinken,
*06:17.640- 06:23.980* :  is now in Tel Aviv. And he's expected to again urge Israel to do more to reduce civilian casualties.
*06:24.760- 06:28.200* :  Our correspondent Paul Adams assesses Mr. Blinken's visit.
*06:28.940- 06:34.080* :  During a previous visit to the region at the end of November, Antony Blinken told Israel to change
*06:34.080- 06:39.200* :  the way it was fighting, to kill fewer civilians and cause less mass displacement.
*06:39.200- 06:45.980* :  Gaza's health officials say almost 250 people have been killed in the past 24 hours alone
*06:45.980- 06:51.520* :  and huge numbers are still on the move. More than one and a half million Palestinians are now
*06:51.520- 06:57.620* :  huddled in the southern city of Raffa, many of them in flimsy tents. The UN says 90 percent of
*06:57.620- 07:02.760* :  children are facing severe food poverty, and the three major hospitals in central and southern
*07:02.760- 07:08.380* :  Gaza are teaching on the verge of collapse. Jim McConnell is from the UN's office for humanitarian
*07:08.380- 07:14.520* :  affairs. Cause for hope is very difficult when I see every day kids like Mahmoud who I met yesterday
*07:14.520- 07:20.340* :  a nine-year-old who just been hit all over his body by shrapnel and another child who had been
*07:20.720- 07:26.420* :  hit by an air strike and had no idea where his family was. In the face of those stories and the
*07:26.420- 07:31.000* :  eyes of these children who carry fear and trauma, it is very difficult to have hope.
*07:31.260- 07:36.860* :  Israeli military officials say their campaign has entered a less intense phase. That's not yet how
*07:36.860- 07:42.080* :  it feels to the people who live in Gaza or perhaps to the scores of Israeli hostages
*07:42.080- 07:47.460* :  who've now been held there for more than three months. Today a video released by Palestinian
*07:47.460- 07:54.300* :  Islamic Jihad showed a 47-year-old Israeli hostage Ilad Katsir. It's been well over a month
*07:54.300- 08:00.380* :  since any hostages were released. Negotiations aimed at bringing others home seemed to have broken
*08:00.700- 08:06.560* :  down. Paul Adams. France's Prime Minister Elizabeth Vaughn has resigned after less than two years
*08:06.560- 08:11.800* :  in the job. Her replacement is expected to be named in the coming hours. As Hugh Scofield reports,
*08:11.800- 08:17.040* :  it had been widely expected that Ms. Vaughn would lose her job as President Emmanuel Macron tries
*08:17.040- 08:23.460* :  to boost his political fortunes ahead of European elections later this year. A day of fevered
*08:23.460- 08:28.400* :  speculation in political circles in Paris ended with the resignation of Prime Minister Vaughn after
*08:28.400- 08:33.300* :  a grueling one and a half years in office. Handicapped by her lack of an outright majority
*08:33.300- 08:37.820* :  in Parliament, she nonetheless fought hard to see through two important pieces of legislation
*08:37.820- 08:42.880* :  on pension reform and immigration and also led the country through the riots of last July.
*08:42.940- 08:48.220* :  But with important European elections approaching, which is the nationalist right of Marina Penn
*08:48.220- 08:53.220* :  is widely tipped to win, President Macron clearly feels the need for a fresh team to take over.
*08:53.580- 08:57.880* :  The new Prime Minister is expected to be named on Tuesday with the Education Minister
*08:57.880- 09:04.040* :  and Macron loyalist Gabriel Attal emerging as favourite. At just 34, he would be the youngest
*09:04.040- 09:10.340* :  Prime Minister in modern French history. Hugh Scofield in Paris. Europe's largest economy
*09:10.340- 09:16.000* :  Germany has already gone through months of turbulence as it looks to fill a funding gap of around
*09:16.000- 09:24.020* :  17 billion euros. Now there are signs the economic situation might be about to go from bad to worse.
*09:31.220- 09:36.600* :  Our Monday farmers in the country blocked a number of roads with tractors and trucks at the start of
*09:36.600- 09:41.900* :  a week-long protest against government subsidy cuts, which they say will drive them out of business.
*09:42.700- 09:47.080* :  Ministers had already said the support would be phased out over time, but that's done little to
*09:47.080- 09:51.920* :  convince farmers like Carla Klissmann, who was at a demonstration northeast of Berlin.
*09:52.720- 09:57.340* :  She's also concerned about the influence of far-right politics in these protests.
*09:57.980- 10:03.300* :  We are standing up for better conditions for our daily work. We need fair prices for our
*10:03.300- 10:09.800* :  hard work to be able to live from our production. This would enable us to produce more sustainably
*10:09.800- 10:15.540* :  and after social conditions. But for this we need financial support from the state.
*10:16.500- 10:22.300* :  Also currently we cannot see people from the from right groups who are floating our movement.
*10:23.120- 10:27.140* :  We need to stop this. I heard more about the demonstrations from our
*10:27.140- 10:32.400* :  correspondent in Berlin, Jessica Parker. I mean it'd be wrong to say that the whole of Germany has
*10:32.400- 10:37.640* :  been brought to a standstill. These things are inevitably a bit patchy so long lines of tractors
*10:37.640- 10:42.960* :  have popped up on some motorways obviously causing disruption but not in other areas. There was
*10:42.960- 10:48.480* :  though one VW plants that experienced blockages today for example and there have been some
*10:48.480- 10:53.020* :  states that have said look if you can't get to school as students then you might need to learn
*10:53.020- 10:58.860* :  remotely today. So there certainly has been disruption as farmers have gone out across the nation
*10:58.860- 11:04.140* :  to really try and make their voice heard over their discontent not just about these planned cuts
*11:04.140- 11:09.440* :  to fuel subsidies but actually speaking to some of the people at the protest here in Berlin today
*11:09.440- 11:15.240* :  a kind of sense of wider discontent actually they feel they're being squeezed by green policies
*11:15.240- 11:20.940* :  the green transition by bureaucracy as well so this seems to have been the the straw that broke
*11:20.940- 11:26.260* :  the camel's back as one campaigner put it to me. As you say this this is part of a much wider
*11:26.260- 11:30.920* :  discontent with Olaf Schultz's government in particular it's handling of the economy.
*11:31.340- 11:36.220* :  Yeah I mean I think Olaf Schultz the chancellor is under a lot of pressure at the moment you've
*11:36.220- 11:42.760* :  got a few things going on this was all sparked this proposal to roll back these tax breaks for
*11:42.760- 11:47.660* :  farmers because they were trying to find savings after the budget crisis that you were mentioning
*11:47.660- 11:53.160* :  before when a the constitutional court ruled that their 2024 budget was unlawful as they tried
*11:53.160- 11:58.420* :  to repurpose pandemic funds and they've been trying to find ways to plug this gap and that's now
*11:58.420- 12:04.340* :  sparked this controversy amongst farmers and then on top of that you've got a train driver strike
*12:04.340- 12:09.360* :  that's due to start on Wednesday so there'll be further disruption as well so I think a very
*12:09.360- 12:16.080* :  difficult start for the year for Olaf Schultz and his traffic-like coalition of three parties.
*12:16.580- 12:21.440* :  And on top of that there's also concern that extremists are trying to further increase tensions
*12:21.440- 12:26.760* :  at demonstrations like these. You said it was one particular incident last week where the green
*12:26.760- 12:31.680* :  party vice chancellor Robert Harbeck was trying to get off a ferry returning from holiday with his
*12:31.680- 12:37.720* :  wife in northern Germany and protesters had gone there to meet him and scenes got pretty heated
*12:37.720- 12:42.260* :  and he didn't in the end get off the ferry and it went away and he ended up disembarking
*12:42.580- 12:48.040* :  somewhere else later on and that really spread or caused some condemnation as people saying we
*12:48.040- 12:53.340* :  mustn't let this debate get too radicalised to overheat it but the other element as well is that
*12:53.340- 13:00.000* :  it's pretty clear that the far right are trying to harness this debate so for example the alternative
*13:00.000- 13:03.680* :  for Deutschlands co-leader Alice Vidal has been talking about how she would actually
*13:03.680- 13:09.140* :  double farm subsidies as a way of trying to show that her party is getting behind the farmers
*13:09.140- 13:15.400* :  and her party continues to poll pretty highly ahead of all the three governing coalition parties so
*13:15.800- 13:18.340* :  it's certainly something the far right is trying to tap into.
*13:19.420- 13:24.820* :  Jessica Parker in Berlin. On the anniversary of an uprising in Brazil when
*13:24.820- 13:29.280* :  supporters of the former president Jair Bolsonaro attacked government buildings.
*13:29.280- 13:34.460* :  The current president Louise Nassio Lula de Silva has said the individuals who
*13:34.460- 13:39.960* :  financed and organised the violence must be punished. The Arada Russia reports.
*13:40.580- 13:46.960* :  President Lula described the unrest as a right-wing coup attempt supported by his predecessor Jair
*13:46.960- 13:53.420* :  Bolsonaro. He said those behind the riots deserve no pardon as forgiving them he said would
*13:53.420- 13:58.600* :  encourage future attacks on Brazilian democracy Mr. Bolsonaro denies involvement.
*13:58.620- 14:03.940* :  During the ceremony restored painting sculptures and a valuable copy of the Constitution
*14:03.940- 14:10.020* :  were returned to Congress. They were among the objects damaged by thousands of right-wing activists
*14:10.020- 14:14.980* :  who stormed the presidential palace the Supreme Court and the Congress a year ago.
*14:15.420- 14:21.280* :  Leonardo Rossa the German footballer France Beckham Bauer who's widely seen as one of the greatest
*14:21.280- 14:27.480* :  players of all time has died at the age of 78. He's one of only three men to have lifted the
*14:27.480- 14:33.240* :  world cup both as a player and a manager. France Beckham Bauer helped change the way the game
*14:33.240- 14:38.820* :  was played and the German football association said he influenced football like no other.
*14:39.060- 14:42.400* :  Our sports correspondent Joe Wilson looks back at his life.
*14:42.920- 14:47.440* :  Friends Beckham Bauer stood at five feet eleven but his command of football made him a giant
*14:47.440- 14:53.500* :  de Kaiser was his nickname. On the pitch he played at the back but Beckham Bauer didn't simply defend
*14:53.500- 14:59.100* :  he began attacks with control authority freedom the so-called sweeper role.
*14:59.720- 15:06.020* :  Beckham Bauer was the leader he played for divided post-war Germany the western part 104 times
*15:06.020- 15:13.340* :  in 1974 they took on a celebrated Netherlands team in the World Cup final in Munich and one.
*15:13.340- 15:19.300* :  President Paul de Chille just the new World Cup the ground back at bar the captain of West Germany.
*15:20.360- 15:24.700* :  In club football Beckham Bauer captained the dominant Bayern Munich to three consecutive
*15:24.700- 15:30.000* :  European cups in the mid 1970s his playing career included later spells in New York
*15:30.000- 15:37.680* :  before he became the manager of West Germany in 1984. In 1990 he won the World Cup again this time
*15:44.300- 15:49.180* :  as the boss. Beckham Bauer's unique status in Germany made him a natural choice
*15:49.180- 15:55.700* :  to lead the country's successful bid to host the 2006 World Cup. He was later charged with corruption
*15:55.700- 16:01.640* :  linked to the bidding process the trial against him ended without a verdict but in the first truly
*16:01.640- 16:08.140* :  global era of football there was Bobby Moore, Pele and Beckham Bauer the names that made the game.
*16:08.720- 16:14.560* :  In Germany friends Beckham Bauer set the exalted standard all footballers there seek and are
*16:14.560- 16:26.600* :  expected to follow. Joe Wilson reporting still to come 5 4 3 we have ignition and liftoff
*16:26.640- 16:33.700* :  of the first United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket. A perfect blast off for now a US space mission

*16:43.940- 16:49.320* :  A web of manipulation and terrifying abuse if you'd have said to do anything I would have done

*17:50.760- 17:55.100* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. China says it's detained a foreign national
*17:55.100- 18:00.300* :  accused of spying for the British Intelligence Service MI6. Beijing alleged that the
*18:00.300- 18:05.140* :  personal in custody was a business consultant who'd been trying to collect information within
*18:05.140- 18:09.440* :  the country for years. Our security correspondent Gordon Carrera reports.
*18:10.100- 18:14.420* :  In a statement the Ministry of State Security said the spy came from a third country
*18:14.940- 18:20.260* :  implying they were neither British nor Chinese and that they were recruited by MI6 in 2015.
*18:21.060- 18:25.320* :  The British Secret Service was said to have provided the individual with training and
*18:25.320- 18:30.960* :  specialist communications equipment as they travelled into China on multiple occasions and then
*18:30.960- 18:37.100* :  provided MI6 with secret and confidential information. The BBC has not been able to independently
*18:37.100- 18:43.140* :  verify the claims and the UK government has a policy of neither confirming nor denying matters
*18:43.140- 18:48.300* :  relating to intelligence issues. The Chinese statement said the individual was the head of a
*18:48.300- 18:53.720* :  consulting agency overseas. China has been engaged in a crackdown in the last year,
*18:54.100- 18:58.940* :  armed foreign business consultants operating in the country, accusing them of gathering sensitive
*18:59.600- 19:04.540* :  information. Beijing has also launched public campaigns to raise awareness of foreign spying
*19:04.960- 19:10.020* :  and increasingly has been publicising cases of alleged espionage by Western countries.
*19:10.540- 19:14.100* :  Previous incidents have focused more on alleged activity by the CIA,
*19:14.220- 19:18.660* :  accusing Britain's MI6 is more unusual. Gordon Carrera
*19:19.360- 19:24.160* :  A US space mission due to be the first for half a century to land on the moon has developed
*19:24.160- 19:29.880* :  a technical hitch. The spacecraft blasted off successfully from Cape Canaveral in Florida on
*19:29.880- 19:35.540* :  Monday. Here's our science correspondent Jonathan Amos. It had started with a picture perfect rocket
*19:35.540- 19:41.020* :  launch that put the Peregrine spacecraft on just the right path to reach the moon next month.
*19:41.800- 19:46.640* :  But within hours, Astrobotic, the company that had devised the mission, was reporting major
*19:46.940- 19:51.880* :  problems. Peregrine was struggling to keep its solar panels pointing at the sun to provide
*19:51.880- 19:56.800* :  essential power. Engineers quickly identified a fault in the propulsion system,
*19:57.260- 20:01.740* :  and although Peregrine was eventually made to point the way it should, the spacecraft was losing
*20:01.740- 20:07.540* :  fuel. Astrobotic conceded a lunar landing looked impossible and that it was now thinking about
*20:07.540- 20:12.480* :  what could be salvaged from the mission's original objectives. The US space agency
*20:12.480- 20:17.060* :  has put five instruments on Peregrine to study the moon's surface environment.
*20:17.660- 20:23.020* :  It's unclear what science could be done even if the Astrobotic craft is only able to
*20:23.020- 20:29.140* :  orbit the moon and not land. Jonathan Amos, the tech giant Apple has begun making payments to
*20:29.140- 20:34.540* :  millions of customers in the US more than three years after agreeing to settle claims that it
*20:34.540- 20:40.180* :  deliberately slowed down the operating speed of some iPhones. Each claimant will receive just
*20:40.180- 20:47.140* :  over $90 as their share of the $500 million settlement. Our technology editor, Zoe Climent,
*20:47.140- 20:53.320* :  has been following the case. Back in 2017, Apple confirmed something that many older iPhone owners
*20:53.320- 20:59.080* :  had long suspected. It was deliberately slowing their devices down. The company had introduced a
*20:59.080- 21:04.160* :  power saving feature to the operating system for some models, and the result of that was that
*21:04.160- 21:09.180* :  they worked more slowly. Apple said it was intended to prolong the life of these devices as the
*21:09.180- 21:14.740* :  batteries aged and became less powerful, but it hadn't informed customers, and after a backlash,
*21:14.740- 21:20.260* :  it eventually agreed to offer battery replacements. A group of those affected launched legal action
*21:20.260- 21:25.080* :  against Apple in the US, and today the firm has settled without admitting responsibility.
*21:25.960- 21:29.980* :  Justin Gutman, who's leading similar legal action against the firm in the UK,
*21:29.980- 21:36.040* :  said the US payout didn't guarantee success here. It doesn't help in terms of
*21:36.740- 21:42.860* :  moving my case forward dramatically, but the case is a good case, and there are so many million
*21:42.860- 21:49.440* :  people involved that, you know, I'm enthusiastic about this, you have to be, otherwise you would never
*21:49.440- 21:55.400* :  start. Apple said it had no statement, but as previously said, it would never intentionally
*21:55.400- 22:01.100* :  shorten the life of its products. The iPhone battery will hold at least 80% of its charge for
*22:01.100- 22:09.220* :  500 cycles. A cycle is one full charge from zero to 100%, a 50% charge counts as half a cycle.
*22:11.240- 22:15.360* :  The Serti Institute in the US is best known for its research into the possible
*22:15.360- 22:21.560* :  existence of extraterrestrial life, but the nonprofit organisation is also interested in contacting
*22:21.600- 22:26.760* :  non-human life here on Earth. Researchers from Serti say they've managed to communicate
*22:26.760- 22:31.500* :  with a humpback whale called Twain. James Reynolds spoke to some of the scientists that
*22:31.500- 22:37.560* :  work together on the project, Serti astrophysicist, Lawrence Doyle, biologist Fred Sharp from the Alaska
*22:37.560- 22:44.160* :  Whale Foundation, and biologist Brendan McCown of the University of California. So what they talk
*22:44.160- 22:51.440* :  about in the conversation with Twain the Whale? We're not entirely sure. We do know that the
*22:51.440- 22:57.180* :  call that we recorded the previous day is a call called The Whoppe, which Fred can talk about
*22:57.480- 23:02.340* :  more specifically, and it's thought to be a contact call. We may have been saying something
*23:02.340- 23:07.080* :  like, hello, back and forth for 20 minutes, but we're not entirely sure yet because we haven't
*23:07.080- 23:12.160* :  decoded the communication system of whales. That's our next goal. Fred, tell us about that
*23:12.200- 23:18.100* :  call. I think Brenda called it the Whoppe call? Yes, humpback whales are extremely diverse vocalists,
*23:18.560- 23:23.000* :  and one of the more common calls that we see throughout the world, both in migration,
*23:23.020- 23:29.120* :  feeding and breeding, is one of these low frequencies sort of broad spectrum drop, or Whoppe call,
*23:29.160- 23:35.040* :  has been the object of study by teams around the world. And we believe that it's one of these sounds,
*23:35.040- 23:39.500* :  maybe like a flock of birds where they just make this call every so often to sort of stay in contact.
*23:39.500- 23:44.320* :  And of course, because their claws travel so well through the water, they can be miles apart.
*23:44.320- 23:51.200* :  It still be compilating. Lawrence, did the humpback to your estimation think that it was in contact
*23:51.200- 23:56.280* :  with another humpback? Oh, no, that's a very good question because it did circle the boat,
*23:56.360- 24:03.540* :  but it didn't see another humpback. But it did match the temporal variations that Brenda was putting
*24:03.540- 24:09.860* :  in. So in other words, the probability that it was having a conversation, you might say, or a
*24:10.160- 24:15.580* :  communicative exchange was very high. It was the going back and forth of matching the temporal
*24:15.580- 24:23.600* :  duration that really made it look more like a conversation. Whether it, yeah, that's a good question.
*24:23.600- 24:28.480* :  I don't know. That's a very good question. What do you guys think? Well, I think that,
*24:28.940- 24:33.540* :  I get the sense that it came up sufficiently close to the vessel to realize that it was not
*24:33.540- 24:38.840* :  another whale, although we may have recorded its sound from the previous days. So it was maybe even
*24:38.840- 24:45.240* :  thinking was looking in some form of acoustic mirror. And until we decode the what call, maybe it
*24:45.240- 24:50.960* :  was asking if we had any great coupon. Brenda, did that 20 minute communication or conversation
*24:50.960- 24:56.260* :  as we describe it? Did it follow the normal rules of communication that we humans have that kind of
*24:56.280- 25:02.040* :  I do my bit, that I listen or at least pretend to listen when you're talking? Yes, so it's turn
*25:02.040- 25:07.160* :  taking. And that's exactly what we do in in human language. And so yes, it does follow similar
*25:07.160- 25:11.780* :  rules. Other species also turn take, though, too, because you have to, of course, listen and also
*25:11.780- 25:17.820* :  speak, right? In order to exchange information. So I would say it probably follows a pretty
*25:17.820- 25:23.400* :  fundamental principle of communication. The behavioral biologist Brenda McCann talking
*25:23.440- 25:30.200* :  near to James Reynolds. That's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global
