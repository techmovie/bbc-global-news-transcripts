*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis

*00:20.840- 00:26.700* :  but a deep voice doesn't sell B2B. An advertising on the wrong platform doesn't sell B2B either.
*00:27.040- 00:31.940* :  That's why if you're a B2B marketer, you should use LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn has the targeting

*00:42.360- 00:47.220* :  also small wigs who are on the path to becoming big wigs. Okay, that's enough about wigs.
*00:47.460- 00:51.660* :  LinkedIn ads allows you to focus on getting your B2B message to the right people.
*00:52.100- 00:57.280* :  So, does that mean you should use ads on LinkedIn instead of hiring me, the man with the deepest
*00:57.280- 01:04.000* :  voice in the world? Yes, yes it does. Get started today and see why LinkedIn is the place to be

*01:56.100- 02:01.620* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Monday, the 15th of January, these are our main
*02:01.620- 02:10.960* :  stories. Denmark has a new king. I will need all the support I can get. Connected and obliged
*02:11.100- 02:21.520* :  to the Kingdom of Denmark. A breakthrough in Ecuador where hostages taken captive by prison
*02:21.520- 02:28.700* :  inmates have been freed. Today the raid was carried out, the work was done, a clean operation
*02:28.700- 02:33.580* :  without any problems. All the pellet entry security guards were freed, full control of the
*02:33.580- 02:39.220* :  prison has been recovered. And a landslide at an unauthorized gold mine in Tanzania kills more
*02:39.220- 02:49.120* :  than 20 people. Also in this podcast, Homes go up in flames as lava from a newly erupting volcano
*02:49.120- 02:57.800* :  reaches an Icelandic town. And... They have not declared a writer to be a terrorist since 1952
*02:58.000- 03:03.900* :  and it's not only me, the authoritarian rule is moving very fast towards totalitarianism.
*03:04.180- 03:10.920* :  The famous Russian novelist Boris Akunin speaks about being branded a foreign agent by Moscow.
*03:15.520- 03:20.880* :  A new era for Danes has begun with the accession of King Frederick, following the abdication
*03:20.880- 03:26.880* :  of his mother, Queen Margaretha. More than 100,000 people turned out to see him proclaim the new
*03:26.880- 03:32.740* :  monarch at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. The proclamation was given by the Danish Prime Minister
*03:32.740- 03:39.660* :  Metta Fredrisken. She declared that Queen Margaretha, the second, has abdicated, long live his
*03:39.660- 03:47.880* :  Majesty King Frederick X. Long live, hence my estate, Kong Fredrik Bencine.
*03:51.620- 03:57.440* :  Queen Margaretha previously said she would reign until she died, but she stunned Danes on
*03:57.440- 04:01.960* :  New Year's Eve when she announced her abdication during her annual televised address.
*04:01.960- 04:06.740* :  The Queen said that her decision was for health reasons. At the end of a reign that lasted
*04:07.400- 04:13.040* :  52 years, there were tears in her eyes when she said, God bless the King, her son addressed the
*04:13.040- 04:21.820* :  crowd from the balcony of the palace. My hope is to become a gathering king of tomorrow.
*04:22.520- 04:27.200* :  It's a task I've approached all my life. It's a responsibility I take on with respect,
*04:27.260- 04:33.300* :  pride and great joy. I will need all the support I can get from my beloved wife,
*04:33.300- 04:38.540* :  from my family, from you. I face the future with the certainty that I'm not alone,
*04:38.680- 04:41.920* :  connected and obliged to the Kingdom of Denmark.
*04:48.340- 04:54.000* :  King Frederick then kissed his Australian wife Mary, who is the first commoner to become queen
*04:54.400- 04:59.280* :  in Denmark. The Danish monarchy dates back to the 10th century and the Vikings. The sovereign
*04:59.280- 05:04.940* :  is now a largely ceremonial role. King Frederick will sign legislation and regularly meet his
*05:04.940- 05:10.420* :  prime minister's cabinet. Our royal correspondent Daniela Rolf was outside Christiansborg Palace
*05:10.420- 05:16.100* :  when Frederick was proclaimed king. It was billed beforehand as being quite a low key event,
*05:16.100- 05:21.440* :  this effectively a coronation of the new King of Denmark. Here they do not have the big ceremony,
*05:21.480- 05:26.100* :  anything that compares to the kind of thing we saw in London last year. It's supposed to have
*05:26.100- 05:31.380* :  been much more low key, but it wasn't how it played out today in Copenhagen. The city came to
*05:31.380- 05:36.980* :  an absolute stop with more than 100,000 people packing the streets on balconies, on rooftops,
*05:37.040- 05:43.080* :  to get a view of the abdicating Queen Margreta and then the proclamation of the new King Frederick.
*05:43.160- 05:47.780* :  I think what really made a difference here was the fact that this came about because of an
*05:47.780- 05:52.480* :  abdication. Previously, of course, when there is a proclamation of a new monarch here in Denmark,
*05:52.480- 05:57.660* :  it has come after the death of a king or queen. It's often during a period of national mourning,
*05:58.180- 06:04.200* :  but because Queen Margreta had chosen to abdicate, the mood here was much more celebratory and that
*06:04.200- 06:08.600* :  definitely was how it felt here in Copenhagen. King Frederick enjoys the support of more than
*06:08.600- 06:14.720* :  80% of Danes according to one poll, Daniela. Why does the monarchy remain so popular?
*06:15.000- 06:20.040* :  So he's inheriting a great legacy from his mother over the past 52 years. As you say,
*06:20.040- 06:25.980* :  all the polling of Danes in terms of their attitude to their royal family puts the popularity of
*06:25.980- 06:32.740* :  the monarchy at 80% and even more so. So there is a very good, strong, consistent legacy for both
*06:32.740- 06:37.240* :  King Frederick and Queen Mary to inherit. And actually in recent polling in the past couple of
*06:37.240- 06:43.300* :  weeks, Queen Mary is the more popular figure of the partnership, again, the Australian outsider
*06:43.300- 06:49.240* :  who married into European royalty and has made a real success of navigating the royal court here
*06:49.240- 06:55.380* :  and winning the popularity of Danes. They feel young, energized, they feel modern, the kind of issues
*06:55.380- 07:00.320* :  that they are both interested in are around sustainability, the environment, gender equality.
*07:00.900- 07:05.980* :  And I think this will be a new phase for the Danish monarchy here, campaigning on some of those
*07:05.980- 07:11.500* :  more fresher issues while also maintaining and reinforcing the legacy that they pick up from
*07:11.500- 07:15.720* :  Queen Margreta. Yeah, you mentioned the Waking Frederick as champion, the environment.
*07:15.720- 07:21.100* :  Is this a new era for European royalty? I think this won't be a revolution, but I think it will
*07:21.100- 07:27.600* :  be a slight transition in terms of what happens over the months and years ahead. I think the other
*07:27.600- 07:33.620* :  key factor here to think about is the fact that Queen Margreta is still present in the background.
*07:34.000- 07:39.100* :  Yes, she has abdicated. She does want to step back. Her health isn't that great. She wants to have
*07:39.100- 07:45.480* :  some time to rest out of the public eye, but she could still prove a very wise council for her
*07:45.480- 07:50.600* :  son in the weeks and months ahead. And I suspect behind the scenes she will still play a very
*07:50.600- 07:57.140* :  significant role in public life in Denmark. Daniela Rolf in Copenhagen. Hamas has released a video
*07:57.140- 08:03.220* :  claiming to show three Israeli hostages alive in its custody in Gaza. In it, one woman and two
*08:03.220- 08:08.020* :  men have seen appealing to the Israeli government to stop its offensive in the territory and
*08:08.020- 08:13.880* :  bring about their release. It's not clear when the video was filmed. Sunday marked 100 days since
*08:13.880- 08:19.560* :  the war between Israel and Hamas began. In Israel, the families of the hostages that remain in Gaza
*08:19.560- 08:23.900* :  held a vigil. They're frustrated that their government isn't doing enough to bring them home
*08:23.900- 08:29.980* :  and renewed calls for their release. Our correspondent, Werah Davis, spoke to relatives on Saturday
*08:29.980- 08:32.000* :  evening, he sent us this report.
*08:38.540- 08:45.200* :  Calling out in desperation at the border fence with Gaza, families of the 131 Israelis and other
*08:45.200- 08:53.300* :  nationals abducted by Hamas and who are still being held. A symbolic but emotional appeal,
*08:53.760- 09:01.040* :  reminding them they are not forgotten. 100 days in hell. That's the name given to this
*09:01.040- 09:05.900* :  event in Tel Aviv tonight. There are thousands of people here not just commemorating what happened
*09:05.900- 09:12.160* :  on October 7th, but also the fact that there are more than 130 people health hostage and are still in
*09:12.160- 09:18.060* :  Gaza. Among those here is Yossi Schneider. Several of his family members, including two young children,
*09:18.060- 09:23.680* :  were taken captive, others were killed. Three generations of my family that disappeared
*09:23.680- 09:28.280* :  and the world's keeping silence and there was nothing about my family for the last one
*09:28.280- 09:36.360* :  angrily. I know I have zero information about them. Just after dawn, 100 days ago, thousands of
*09:36.360- 09:42.560* :  heavily armed Hamas fighters stormed through the Gaza border fence. The sounds and images recorded
*09:42.560- 09:48.600* :  on their own body cameras. They attacked Kibbutz's military bases and the music festival.
*09:49.180- 09:54.740* :  1200 people were killed along the length of the border as Israeli defences were caught completely
*09:54.740- 10:03.620* :  by surprise. Later that same day, Israel embarked on an unprecedented bombing campaign in Gaza.
*10:04.980- 10:10.500* :  Fighter jets and tanks launched missiles and shells. Israel's goal, the complete destruction
*10:10.500- 10:16.920* :  of Hamas and its support structure. Much of the territory from Gaza City in the north to Han
*10:16.920- 10:24.500* :  Unis in the south has since been destroyed. Hamas has been severely weakened, but the number of
*10:24.500- 10:31.180* :  civilians killed in Gaza has been huge. More than 23,000 dead according to the Hamas run health
*10:31.180- 10:38.120* :  ministry. Palestinian officials say that 85% of Gaza's population has been displaced. The UN's
*10:38.120- 10:48.060* :  humanitarian chief has described the situation as intolerable. Faten Abu Shahada needs regular kidney
*10:48.060- 10:54.600* :  dialysis. She and the family have been forced to move further south. Home is now a plastic tent
*10:54.600- 11:03.420* :  in Han Unis. The sound of an Israeli drone overhead, a constant companion. Gaza has been destroyed.
*11:03.940- 11:10.220* :  There is no Gaza left. No hospitals, no education. Our children have lost their school year.
*11:10.880- 11:16.660* :  Gaza is no longer alive. Every war is becoming worse than the former one. It's not a game.
*11:16.760- 11:22.180* :  Gideon Levy is a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Arets, a frequent critic of the Netanyahu
*11:22.180- 11:29.060* :  government. I asked him if this war, already Israel's longest since 1948, would soon come to a
*11:29.060- 11:34.800* :  conclusion. The war in its current shape will last as long as the Americans will let Israel.
*11:34.800- 11:39.800* :  I don't think it's going to be many weeks more, but this does not mean that the war is over,
*11:40.100- 11:44.540* :  because nobody thought about the day after. If Israel doesn't pull out of Gaza,
*11:44.540- 11:51.060* :  there will be resistance, there will be retaliation. Israel says the fighting will not end until
*11:51.060- 11:57.020* :  Hamas is completely defeated. The immediate future across the region, and especially for thousands
*11:57.080- 12:02.020* :  of civilians living in appalling conditions in Gaza, looks particularly beautiful.
*12:03.540- 12:09.900* :  We're a Davis. Nearly 180 people who'd been taken hostage by prisoners across Ecuador
*12:09.900- 12:15.180* :  are reported to have been freed. It's part of an ongoing major security operation to restore
*12:15.180- 12:20.880* :  order in Ecuadorian prisons taken over by inmates who belong to drugs gangs. Video footage
*12:20.880- 12:26.440* :  released by the army showed troops backed by armored vehicles moving into one jail in the city
*12:26.440- 12:31.540* :  of Macala. Hundreds of inmates were shown stripped to their underwear with their hands tied.
*12:31.540- 12:36.760* :  The police commander in Tengura, who are renowned Miller, gave this update on operations.
*12:39.020- 12:44.640* :  Today, the raid was carried out. The work was done. A clean operation without any problems.
*12:45.360- 12:49.720* :  All the penitentiary security guards were freed. Full control of the prison has been recovered.
*12:49.720- 12:54.580* :  We're going to leave police and armed forces personnel to guard this center so that it doesn't
*12:54.580- 12:59.760* :  happen again. A state of emergency remains in place following some of the worst violence in
*12:59.760- 13:05.300* :  Ecuador for years, two infamous gang leaders who escaped from jail during the unrest are still on
*13:05.300- 13:11.720* :  the loose. Caroline Lose Leon is a freelance journalist in Manter on Ecuador's Pacific coast.
*13:12.060- 13:16.900* :  Rebecca Kesby asked her whether the security forces are beginning to get the upper hand.
*13:17.560- 13:22.520* :  On the six days of operations around the country by the military, there has been a release of
*13:22.520- 13:28.740* :  the hostages in several persons in about seven provinces late hours of the night early morning
*13:28.740- 13:34.260* :  here in Ecuador. But this was done after an effort with the armed forces, the police, and the
*13:34.260- 13:39.580* :  Catholic Church on a mediation. And today in the early hours of the morning, there have been
*13:39.580- 13:45.260* :  operations in several persons who tried to gain control so far. I know they're one in El Oro
*13:45.260- 13:50.340* :  on the southern part of Ecuador. Now the armed forces have gained full control, but the others
*13:50.340- 13:56.580* :  are still ongoing and have been under control of several of these criminal gangs that have
*13:56.580- 14:01.180* :  created the chaos that we're now seeing around the country. It's the army, isn't it? They're
*14:01.180- 14:07.280* :  heavily armed. They're going in with armored vehicles. It's unprecedented for Ecuador. Do we
*14:07.280- 14:11.960* :  think that the prisons where they have got control? Is that a sustainable situation? How are they
*14:11.960- 14:17.300* :  managing to keep the gang violence at bay? Well, this is the big question for the government in
*14:17.300- 14:22.160* :  the long run because these operations are in order to call the violence. That's been taken
*14:22.160- 14:28.000* :  place over the past week, but there has always been, on the past few years, a control of persons
*14:28.000- 14:33.800* :  by different gang members. And the prisons rights that we've seen are a result of that fight for
*14:33.800- 14:39.720* :  power inside the prisons to keep their operations going in and out of the prison. So how are they
*14:39.720- 14:44.700* :  going to keep these gangs away from regaining control? Is something that we have to see once they
*14:44.700- 14:50.880* :  get control of the prisons? And if we have an end to the manhand of Adolfo Macias, known as Fito,
*14:50.880- 14:55.620* :  the leader of Los Choneiros, one of the strongest criminal gangs in the country who's still in
*14:55.620- 15:03.300* :  manhand. Yes, as you say, Fito is still at large and the other senior gang chief as well. Any
*15:03.300- 15:08.900* :  news of where they may have gone and how much support they may have from armed gang members?
*15:09.200- 15:14.440* :  There's no information about the whereabouts. This is quite concerning for the government and people
*15:14.440- 15:19.460* :  right now in the city where I am in Manta. There has been a heavy military presence around his
*15:19.460- 15:24.160* :  house that was raided yesterday. Of course, none of his family members were there. And people are
*15:24.160- 15:28.120* :  wondering in cities like mountains, he have support is he's still in the country. Many people
*15:28.120- 15:32.720* :  worry that he had fled the country. Many people find a relief to find a military
*15:32.720- 15:37.520* :  in the streets because these bands operate with extortions and they usually start extorting
*15:37.520- 15:43.900* :  ranchers and people working day jobs in small businesses. So for many of them means that these
*15:43.900- 15:49.420* :  groups might not have that control anymore and they can have a bit of calm within this chaos.
*15:49.420- 15:55.280* :  So it must be a very anxious time for people. We've got this state of emergency, new powers
*15:55.280- 16:00.920* :  for the security forces. I mean, ordinary people just sort of staying at home. Yes, the early days
*16:00.920- 16:06.040* :  after the initial chaos that we saw early in the week show people very cautious is going out into
*16:06.040- 16:12.940* :  the streets. It was a deja vu of the times where we had the initial restrictions during the pandemic
*16:12.940- 16:17.040* :  lifted and many people were very worried to go out in the streets. It's in cities like
*16:17.040- 16:21.840* :  Manta where I am. People have been cautious and like other times. This is summertime and the
*16:21.840- 16:27.540* :  coastal part of Ecuador. So many people would have been on the beach, the beach with very few
*16:27.540- 16:33.520* :  people right now there and people just don't know what to expect next. And usually the city of
*16:33.520- 16:37.680* :  Manta that has had his fair share of violence over the past year because of these groups.
*16:38.200- 16:43.240* :  It used to have this dynamic of going back to normal as soon as it could and usually
*16:43.240- 16:48.740* :  meant that we can not this time. I can feel the fear of people going out. It is quite tense,
*16:48.740- 16:55.760* :  the environment all around. Journalist Caroline Loseleon in Ecuador. A landslide at an illegal
*16:55.760- 17:00.840* :  gold mine in northern Tanzania has killed more than 20 people. The accident happened on Saturday
*17:00.840- 17:05.820* :  in the Simeo region after a group of people started mining in an area where activity
*17:05.820- 17:10.940* :  had been restricted due to heavy rains. With more details here's our Africa Regional Editor
*17:10.940- 17:17.040* :  Richard Hamilton. The emergency services said they were closing the rescue operation as they were
*17:17.040- 17:22.900* :  convinced no more bodies were under the rubble. Earlier an official had said a group of people had
*17:22.900- 17:29.440* :  moved into the area when they found signs of gold but had defied orders by the authorities to stop
*17:29.440- 17:34.700* :  until safety procedures have been put in place. The government has been trying to improve
*17:34.700- 17:42.700* :  safety for small scale miners but unregulated and illegal exploration still occurs. Tanzania is
*17:42.700- 17:49.180* :  Africa's fourth largest producer of gold. The region has been experiencing flash flooding and
*17:49.180- 17:54.340* :  torrential rains linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon. Richard Hamilton.
*17:55.320- 18:00.740* :  Since its large-scale invasion of Ukraine began nearly two years ago, Russia has cracked down
*18:00.740- 18:06.600* :  ever more harshly on freedom of expression at home. Even those living in exile have been targeted.
*18:06.600- 18:13.140* :  On Saturday, the best-selling author and government critic Boris Akunin was officially declared
*18:13.140- 18:18.620* :  a foreign agent by Moscow. Now, living in London, he's been accused of spreading false information,
*18:18.620- 18:24.520* :  creating a negative image of Russia and the war and of raising money for Ukraine's war effort.
*18:24.900- 18:30.700* :  Mr Akunin spoke to Julian Warrika about Vladimir Putin's continuing campaign against him.
*18:31.420- 18:37.140* :  In December, I was declared in Russia a terrorist at an extremist which is much more serious
*18:37.380- 18:42.260* :  because it means they read notice you, they start a criminal investigation with a guarantee
*18:42.260- 18:49.620* :  of a long prison term. So it's basically like you were hung, drawn and quartered and now they say,
*18:49.620- 18:54.380* :  wait, stop, stop. We also have a speeding ticket for you. Elections are due in March.
*18:54.380- 19:02.080* :  Usually, before an election, Vladimir Putin tries to bribe the electorate, giving them money
*19:02.080- 19:09.080* :  now because all the money is being spent on the war. He cannot afford it. So instead of the carrot,
*19:09.080- 19:16.740* :  he's taking the stick. He's trying to scare people. They picked me, not because I'm such a big deal.
*19:16.920- 19:22.900* :  It's just because I am a mass author. There have been 35 million of my books sold in Russia.
*19:22.900- 19:28.120* :  It means that they are in many of Russia's homes and all people who have a book of mine and
*19:28.120- 19:33.000* :  they at home have to think twice. What if somebody comes and sees a book of mine on the shelf?
*19:33.000- 19:39.640* :  So it creates an atmosphere of fear of nervousness. Just to get a facts straight,
*19:39.640- 19:42.180* :  have you been helping raise money for the Ukrainian military?
*19:42.540- 19:47.900* :  No, because I am one of the founders of British Heritage Foundation, which is called
*19:47.900- 19:54.000* :  True Russia, which is a humanitarian organization that cannot collect money to kill someone.
*19:54.480- 20:00.040* :  So we basically concentrate on humanitarian projects, helping Ukrainians in exile,
*20:00.040- 20:03.240* :  helping people wound it in the war. So it's basically it's alive.
*20:03.300- 20:08.020* :  Fine, and you've been very openly critical of the war and the reasons behind it.
*20:08.400- 20:11.900* :  So the allegation of distributing false and negative information about Russia,
*20:11.900- 20:15.920* :  as the Russians see it, is one that you would presumably acknowledge.
*20:16.620- 20:18.120* :  Guilty as charge, yes.
*20:18.340- 20:22.780* :  Right. So here you are in exile, unable to go back there now, I don't doubt.
*20:23.340- 20:25.480* :  How does anything change, do you think?
*20:25.660- 20:30.720* :  For me personally, it doesn't mean anything. For all I care, they can put me in front of a
*20:30.720- 20:36.040* :  firing squad as long as it is an absence here. And I have no plans of going to Russia anytime soon.
*20:36.500- 20:42.080* :  But for people in Russia, this is a serious step down the ladder.
*20:42.560- 20:49.400* :  Books literature, which until now have been the last zone of cultural life in Russia,
*20:49.840- 20:54.980* :  which remained more or less uncensored, is going to be restricted and censored.
*20:54.980- 21:02.620* :  Because they have not declared a writer to be a terrorist since 1952, the Stalin area.
*21:02.980- 21:09.020* :  And it's not only me, it's also Dmitry Baker, who is an incredibly talented author.
*21:09.360- 21:13.680* :  So his books have been banned too, and it is of course only at the beginning.
*21:14.380- 21:18.060* :  So this is a serious step down for Russia now.
*21:18.080- 21:23.660* :  It means that the authoritarian rule is moving very fast towards totalitarianism.
*21:24.120- 21:26.680* :  Russian author Boris Akunin.
*21:29.740- 21:32.180* :  Still to come in the Global News Podcast.
*21:32.220- 21:36.660* :  I need each and every one of you to get out and vote. But bring them all out,
*21:36.660- 21:38.920* :  because we have to set this nature in November.
*21:39.620- 21:44.260* :  Donald Trump urges his supporters in Iowa to vote ahead of the first caucus
*21:44.720- 21:47.100* :  of the 2024 presidential campaign.
*21:55.840- 22:01.280* :  Iceland's Prime Minister has called it a black day for the country after a volcanic eruption
*22:01.280- 22:04.180* :  continues to decimate homes in Grindervik.
*22:04.540- 22:07.500* :  Flames, smoke and lava have reached the fishing town,
*22:07.500- 22:11.100* :  barriers installed after another eruption in the area back in December,
*22:11.540- 22:12.800* :  have provided some protection.
*22:13.400- 22:16.100* :  Olafore Andal runs a restaurant in the area.
*22:16.100- 22:19.380* :  He's among thousands who've had to evacuate for a second time.
*22:22.300- 22:26.960* :  We were just at home, and unlike before, we did what we were told this time.
*22:27.580- 22:31.340* :  But I'm flabbergasted that an eruption is possible under the town.
*22:31.880- 22:33.040* :  It's something I can't believe.
*22:35.080- 22:40.600* :  At a news conference on Sunday, Prime Minister Katrin Jakobs.ts said the nation would face
*22:40.600- 22:44.900* :  the disaster with solidarity and resilience. The mayor of Grindervik,
*22:45.100- 22:51.420* :  Fana Jonason, said the focus was on finding permanent housing for the town's displaced residents.
*22:52.120- 22:52.200* :  The
*22:56.480- 22:59.880* :  recent days and weeks have shown a large crack in the town.
*22:59.900- 23:04.500* :  It's a big and serious shock for the population. There's nothing to do right now.
*23:04.500- 23:09.900* :  This does not look good. The BBC's Megan Owen is following the story closely and told me more.
*23:10.260- 23:15.480* :  In the early hours of the morning, we saw this orange glowing lava against the night sky
*23:15.480- 23:19.640* :  backdrop, and that was striking enough in itself. But actually, as the sun started to rise,
*23:19.640- 23:25.880* :  you could see just how close the lava was to the fishing village of Grindervik, and that's only
*23:25.880- 23:31.840* :  become more turbulent throughout the day. At around 8am, the volcano started to erupt,
*23:31.840- 23:36.400* :  and that was the first fisher. And I don't think authorities expected this, but a second
*23:36.400- 23:42.260* :  fisher then started to erupt a few hours later. And that was closer to the fishing village.
*23:42.400- 23:48.080* :  And what we're seeing now is the lava creeping into the town. And we've been watching these
*23:48.080- 23:52.840* :  pictures all morning that we've got to remember that residents are also watching these pictures.
*23:52.840- 23:59.440* :  They're watching their homes become destroyed. And luckily, all of them were evacuated overnight.
*23:59.440- 24:04.900* :  And we remember back in December when the entire area was evacuated. People had started to come back.
*24:04.900- 24:09.300* :  And of course, this is now thrown in spanner in the works. And this is all happening very close
*24:09.300- 24:14.420* :  to one of the major tourist attractions that most visitors to Iceland go to. Exactly. It's right next
*24:14.420- 24:20.700* :  to the Blue Lagoon, which was closed back in November when seismic activity was registered,
*24:20.700- 24:27.680* :  a familiar place for many people who visited Iceland. The country goes through a lot of instability
*24:27.680- 24:32.620* :  when it comes to volcanic eruptions. It lies on two plates, but I think this is a reminder
*24:32.620- 24:39.100* :  of just how unstable the country is. How much danger to life is there? Well, the president
*24:39.100- 24:45.320* :  has said that no lives are in danger, although the main concern is infrastructure. As I mentioned,
*24:45.320- 24:51.400* :  everyone was evacuated overnight at around 3 a.m. But now the concern is infrastructure.
*24:51.460- 24:56.200* :  It's the electricity supplies. It's the pipes. And you only have to look at those pictures
*24:56.200- 25:01.080* :  to realize that actually not much of this is going to go unscathed in the town.
*25:01.660- 25:08.420* :  Megan Owen. The candidates to be the next Republican nominee for US President are holding their
*25:08.420- 25:13.300* :  final campaign events in the state of Iowa, despite the freezing temperatures that are expected
*25:13.300- 25:19.120* :  to disrupt Monday's caucus votes. Opinion polls suggest Donald Trump is well ahead,
*25:19.120- 25:23.940* :  but Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are involved in a tight scrap for second.
*25:23.940- 25:29.820* :  On Sunday, Mr. Trump paid a surprise visit to Iowa, where he urged his supporters to vote.
*25:59.460- 26:04.080* :  The final poll before the Iowa caucus is always carefully watched. This year,
*26:04.080- 26:09.100* :  it's nothing but good news for Donald Trump. The NBC Des Moines Register poll suggests that
*26:09.100- 26:14.900* :  on 48 percent, he's not just miles ahead. He may score more votes than his two main rivals
*26:14.900- 26:20.660* :  combined, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. They are in a tight race for second place. The same
*26:20.660- 26:25.460* :  poll put Ms. Haley four points ahead of the Florida Governor, Mr. DeSantis. And she also comes out
*26:25.460- 26:30.600* :  as more likely than her competitors to beat Joe Biden in November in a separate CBS news poll
*26:30.600- 26:35.500* :  of voters nationwide. In an interview with Fox News, she said her recent momentum has led to
*26:35.500- 26:39.500* :  attacks from arrivals. I think we've always had a target on our back because we've been the one
*26:39.500- 26:43.900* :  moving up. Everybody else is going down. And that's a great thing, but the real poll you know
*26:44.440- 26:48.500* :  is on caucus day. And what we've said is we just want to come out of Iowa looking strong.
*26:48.500- 26:54.120* :  Ron DeSantis has invested very heavily in Iowa, finishing third with seriously damages campaign.
*26:54.660- 26:58.780* :  He says polls can't predict a result that's likely to be affected by the bitterly cold weather
*26:58.780- 27:03.480* :  across the state. Donald Trump supporters appear to be more enthusiastic about their candidate,
*27:03.480- 27:08.540* :  so perhaps more likely to leave home to attend a caucus, but they may think he's so far ahead.
*27:08.540- 27:16.380* :  He doesn't need their support. Sarah Smith. Now to a royal wedding ceremony in the oil rich
*27:16.380- 27:22.580* :  sultanate of Brunei, Prince Abdul Batin often referred to as Asia's most eligible bachelor,
*27:22.580- 27:28.900* :  tied the knot on Sunday with Anisha Rosna, the event culminated in a lavish reception for
*27:28.900- 27:35.840* :  5,000 guests, including the leaders of Indonesia and the Philippines. And as our southeast Asia
*27:36.660- 27:42.260* :  correspondent Jonathan Head explains, the prince is extremely popular despite not being the air
*27:42.260- 27:47.140* :  to his father's throne. With its oil-based wealth and rule ban absolute monarch,
*27:47.140- 27:51.600* :  Brunei more closely resembles one of the Gulf states than any of its Southeast Asian
*27:51.600- 27:56.520* :  neighbours. Brunei's royals lead lives as extravagant as any in the Middle East.
*27:57.220- 28:02.960* :  So the wedding of Prince Abdul Batin to Anisha Rosna was marked by a glittering succession of
*28:02.960- 28:11.340* :  ceremonies lasting 10 days. The couple appearing on each of them in different coloured costumes
*28:11.340- 28:17.320* :  based on traditional malay designs. As the fourth son of Sultan Bulkia, the world's longest
*28:17.320- 28:22.480* :  reigning monarch, the 32-year-old prince is well down the line of succession to the throne.
*28:23.260- 28:27.880* :  But he is a very visible member of the royal family, often accompanying his father on official
*28:27.880- 28:34.720* :  visits and posting frequently on social media, usually in an informal style which has won him a
*28:34.720- 28:43.120* :  wide following. Today we're all together in celebrating this royal wedding ceremony, enjoying
*28:43.120- 28:49.080* :  the procession. We feel very excited and happy to be given the opportunity to witness our beloved
*28:49.080- 28:56.520* :  country's prince, our Brunei Prince Charmin. Modernising its public image is not really a priority
*28:56.520- 29:01.740* :  for Brunei's monarchy, which is protected from any criticism by its absolute power,
*29:02.240- 29:07.120* :  and by the prosperity the Sultanate's oil and gas has delivered for its small population.
*29:08.020- 29:13.760* :  But Brunei's hydrocarbon reserves are expected to run dry within decades, and it's struggling
*29:13.760- 29:21.060* :  to diversify its economy. In this uncertain future, telegenic young royals may start to be seen
*29:21.060- 29:26.600* :  as an important asset for the monarchy's survival. Jonathan Head with that report.
*29:27.800- 29:33.380* :  Haiti became the first independent Caribbean state when it threw off French colonial rule and
*29:33.380- 29:39.860* :  slavery in the early 19th century. But chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters
*29:40.340- 29:45.000* :  have seen it ranked as the poorest nation in the Americas. It's currently overwhelmed by gang
*29:45.000- 29:51.680* :  violence, but Haiti has a rich cultural and linguistic heritage. The Haitian American singer and
*29:51.680- 29:58.940* :  musician Natalie Jo Asham has been exploring her Haitian identity on her new album, Ki Moon Uye,
*29:58.940- 30:04.480* :  which means who are you? The BBC's Martin Venard asked why she chose that title.
*30:08.960- 30:16.860* :  It was sort of the landmark question for me in this moment in my life, and this music really
*30:16.860- 30:21.880* :  allowed me to explore and begin to be honest with myself about the answer to that question.
*30:22.200- 30:27.980* :  And who are you? I'm not sure that I figured out exactly who I am or continuing to become,
*30:28.240- 30:37.700* :  but I know that for sure I am a Haitian woman with a complicated ancestry and a complicated
*30:38.120- 30:41.760* :  history, but one that I feel very proud of.
*30:46.560- 30:51.620* :  This moment of my life has been about becoming a woman who feels healed, not just healed for
*30:51.620- 30:57.660* :  myself, but healed for my ancestors, and also leaning into the strength and the power of who they
*30:57.660- 31:04.600* :  were. This music was all written on my family's land in the southern region of Haiti,
*31:04.960- 31:10.240* :  and my family has been there now for seven generations and counting. For me, it is the most
*31:10.300- 31:16.620* :  magical place on earth, and is perhaps the best setting for me to begin to understand who I am.
*31:16.980- 31:24.120* :  It's hidden in the valley between Makaya, which is our great mountain range, and also our seaside,
*31:24.460- 31:30.140* :  a beautiful countryside, full of rice fields, fruit trees, and livestock.
*31:40.940- 31:46.060* :  So the album is sung in Creole and in English. How do you decide which language to use?
*31:46.640- 31:53.480* :  Our language actually holds so much of our history within it, and so for me there were things that
*31:53.980- 31:59.460* :  I could only express in the deepest way through Haitian Creole, but of course I'm American
*31:59.460- 32:05.160* :  born, and so English is also a language that I feel like there are pieces of me that can only be
*32:05.160- 32:10.980* :  expressed in that way. Obviously I'm trained as a classical musician, and so there are elements
*32:10.980- 32:18.680* :  of orchestration and chamber music here that are really evident, but also I began to embrace a lot
*32:18.680- 32:22.480* :  of the folkloric music of Haiti. You hear a lot of that in this as well.
*32:31.940- 32:37.200* :  My grandmother was perhaps the most special person to me in my life. The very first song that I
*32:37.200- 32:43.520* :  wrote on this record, I used samples of my grandmother's voice singing a church hymn that was a
*32:54.460- 32:59.740* :  favorite of hers. Haiti has had a very troubled recent history as well. There has been political
*32:59.740- 33:07.240* :  violence and gang violence. What influences that had on you or on your music? I tend to really focus
*33:07.660- 33:14.440* :  on the beauty that still exists while it's very easy to disregard the story of Haitian people
*33:15.120- 33:25.520* :  as one of struggle and heartbreak and poverty. There are also so many incredible people living in
*33:25.520- 33:32.040* :  Haiti who also care very deeply about each other, care very deeply about the country, care very
*33:41.680- 33:45.580* :  deeply for their communities and for themselves. Natalie Jo Asham speaking to Martin Venard.
*33:48.760- 33:55.260* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*33:55.820- 34:02.380* :  This edition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is
*34:02.380- 34:06.400* :  Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson. Until next time, goodbye.
