*01:29.800- 01:32.680* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:35.320- 01:41.020* :  I'm Robin Brands at 1400 hours GMT on Thursday the 25th of January and these are our main
*01:41.020- 01:47.000* :  stories. Reports from Russia say missile fragments and two black box flight recorders have been
*01:47.000- 01:52.120* :  found at the site of a plane crash which is said to have killed tens of Ukrainian prisoners of war.
*01:52.640- 01:57.300* :  Intense fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants has continued in southern Gaza
*01:57.840- 02:01.280* :  after a United Nations shelter for displaced people was hit.
*02:04.100- 02:10.020* :  Also coming up in this podcast. These all came from the British raid on Kumasi in 1874.
*02:10.180- 02:13.860* :  This is a peace pipe when a shanty kings got together.
*02:14.780- 02:19.220* :  A shanty gold the UK is to loan back Ghana's looted crown jewels.
*02:24.300- 02:29.740* :  But we begin this Global News podcast with the ongoing blame game between Russia and Ukraine
*02:29.740- 02:34.800* :  more than 24 hours after a Russian military plane came down near the Ukrainian border
*02:34.800- 02:41.060* :  killing all 74 people on board. Russia which says the plane was carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war
*02:41.060- 02:46.280* :  said Ukraine had shot it down and called for an inquiry into President Vladimir Zelensky.
*02:46.700- 02:50.760* :  Mr. Zelensky though for his part said there should be an international investigation.
*02:53.420- 02:57.100* :  It is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners,
*02:57.100- 03:00.400* :  with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society.
*03:00.400- 03:04.380* :  We need to establish all the clear facts as much as possible given that the
*03:04.380- 03:08.000* :  downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory which is beyond our control.
*03:08.660- 03:12.920* :  Well Ukraine has not admitted to shooting down the plane but did say that Russian aircraft
*03:12.920- 03:18.860* :  flying in that area were considered legitimate targets. Russia now says it's recovered to black
*03:18.860- 03:23.340* :  boxes from the crash sites which should contain crucial voice and data recordings.
*03:23.340- 03:28.520* :  But whether any Russian report on them is believed or even believable is open to question.
*03:29.040- 03:32.660* :  In a moment we'll hear from our correspondence in the Ukrainian capital Kiev.
*03:33.260- 03:36.380* :  But first I spoke to Elizabetho Fox from BBC Russian.
*03:36.900- 03:41.180* :  But at this point we don't have any independent confirmation of what happened and the only
*03:41.180- 03:48.120* :  things where our 100% sure about are two. The first is that the plane definitely crashed
*03:48.120- 03:53.380* :  near the Ukrainian border yesterday yesterday morning. And the second is Ukraine and Russia were
*03:53.380- 03:59.320* :  expected to have a massive prisoner swap yesterday. No one's denying this. Then Russia of course
*03:59.320- 04:03.940* :  was very quick to blame Ukraine for shooting down this plane. And the Russian MOD
*04:03.940- 04:09.500* :  insists it was full of Ukrainian prisoners of war and that all of them are dead now.
*04:09.500- 04:14.800* :  We can't independently confirm it's true. But yesterday Margarita Semanyan, editor-in-chief
*04:14.800- 04:21.420* :  of Russia today, one of Russia's top propagandists published a list of the soldiers who were
*04:21.420- 04:27.740* :  allegedly the passengers of the plane. And again we don't know if it's true but we check more than
*04:27.740- 04:33.860* :  20 of those names and confirm that they actually belong to people who have been mentioned
*04:33.860- 04:38.460* :  you know in the recent months as Ukrainian prisoners of war. But again we don't know if that
*04:39.120- 04:43.680* :  were on board. Russia says they've found two black boxes which could be a crucial part of any
*04:43.680- 04:49.460* :  investigation. What do you think the chances are that they will go further and allow you know
*04:49.460- 04:53.880* :  maybe any Ukrainian or even international investigation into what happened? I mean is there a
*04:53.880- 04:57.840* :  chance of that? I think the chances are really really slim. But again I think the main question now
*04:57.840- 05:02.940* :  is not how the plane crashed. Of course it's very important but who was on board and we still don't
*05:02.940- 05:08.220* :  know anything about that. But again I think the chances that Russia will allow Ukrainian or
*05:08.220- 05:14.560* :  even international investigators to come at this crash side to tackle all the evidence available
*05:14.560- 05:17.920* :  so I think those chances are really really really slim, close to nonexistent.
*05:18.100- 05:23.600* :  Elizabetha Fox. So what about the view from Ukraine's capital Keeve or Sarah Rainford is there?
*05:23.840- 05:29.400* :  There are huge questions to answer and the problem of getting those answers is of course that the
*05:29.400- 05:34.380* :  crash site is in the Belgrade region and that at the moment there is no access to it for independent
*05:34.960- 05:39.020* :  people, for outsiders. The black boxes have been recovered apparently they will of course be
*05:39.020- 05:45.080* :  examined by Russia not by an independent body but of course a state controlled one and the same
*05:45.080- 05:50.540* :  goes to the crash site. We certainly have seen fragments of that downed plane. We know that a plane
*05:50.540- 05:57.720* :  came down. Ukraine hasn't denied that it may have shot that plane down. I think what the big question
*05:57.760- 06:04.420* :  is how that happened and whether or not there were as Russia still claims, Ukrainian prisoners of
*06:04.420- 06:08.700* :  war on board that plane. I mean that's the critical question as far as Ukraine's concerned because
*06:08.700- 06:14.520* :  the chance that it might have made some kind of horrible mistake or that something so awful has
*06:14.520- 06:20.280* :  happened. It will be a huge deal of course here within Ukraine itself. So there's a lot of
*06:20.280- 06:24.580* :  questions. Of course there's a lot of competing statements but I think we should say one thing
*06:24.580- 06:29.600* :  pretty clearly. Of course this is a war. Of course there is misinformation and propaganda all
*06:29.600- 06:35.320* :  around but there is also one clear fact which is that Russia has many many years of proven
*06:35.320- 06:40.420* :  record of lies and disinformation and remember that this war was started on a lie. The whole idea
*06:40.420- 06:45.500* :  that there was a Nazi-backed regime supposedly protecting Russian speakers from genocide. So I
*06:45.500- 06:48.960* :  think it is important to keep that in mind whenever we're considering statements that came out of
*06:48.960- 06:54.380* :  Moscow. Sarah Rainsford. Now the UK is the latest state to warn the Israeli prime minister Benjamin
*06:54.380- 07:01.220* :  Netanyahu to agree an immediate humanitarian pause in the war with Hamas to allow more aid to
*07:01.220- 07:07.220* :  get into Gaza. The latest urging came from Britain's foreign secretary David Cameron during his
*07:07.220- 07:14.020* :  ongoing tour of the Middle East. It's time for an immediate pause in the fighting because we've
*07:14.020- 07:19.120* :  got to not only get the aid in but crucially we've got to get those hostages out and what I think
*07:19.120- 07:25.420* :  we can do now is plan for how you turn that pause into a permanent sustainable seaspa
*07:25.840- 07:30.180* :  without a return to fighting. That's what I was pushing on him and that's what I'll be talking
*07:30.180- 07:36.320* :  about here today. David Cameron. Now intense fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants
*07:36.320- 07:42.620* :  has continued in the south of Gaza. As investigations go on into whose shell fire hit a united
*07:42.620- 07:48.460* :  nation's shelter for displaced people killing several people and injuring many many more. Our
*07:48.460- 07:54.280* :  correspondent Yolanda Nell in Jerusalem gave us this update. We've got a senior UN official
*07:54.800- 07:59.600* :  in Gaza talking about how there are persistent attacks on civilian sites in Hanyunis now saying
*07:59.600- 08:03.820* :  these utterly unacceptable. They must stop immediately because people are being killed and injured.
*08:03.820- 08:09.360* :  We're seeing very intense fighting now around the main hospitals where you have doctors and
*08:09.360- 08:17.120* :  patients but also huge numbers of displaced people are trapped inside. We understand that
*08:18.260- 08:23.200* :  local residents saying that really there's now nonstop aerial and ground fire with the
*08:23.200- 08:31.020* :  the city totally encircled by Israeli ground troops. And the UN facility that was struck by
*08:31.020- 08:37.580* :  showing it's not clear what side essentially that came from but doing any more specifics about
*08:37.580- 08:42.860* :  that and the number of people that were injured or who are dead. What we've been told is at least
*08:42.860- 08:48.800* :  nine people were killed and 75 were injured in this strike on the workshop inside the Hanyunis
*08:48.800- 08:55.260* :  training center. It belongs to another biggest UN agency operating in the Gaza Strip and it
*08:55.260- 09:00.120* :  been functioning as a shelter. This one building for roughly 800 displaced Palestinians.
*09:00.120- 09:06.140* :  It was set on fire by the strike but this whole complex is where there's an estimated 30,000
*09:06.140- 09:14.340* :  displaced Palestinians. So the White House was quick to come out condemning this strike. It
*09:14.340- 09:19.460* :  doesn't normally issue statements about individual strikes in Gaza but it calls a lot of concern.
*09:19.460- 09:24.340* :  The Israeli military launched investigation it said into the incident but it said it already
*09:24.340- 09:28.380* :  determined its air and artillery forces weren't responsible that it was looking into its ground
*09:28.380- 09:33.780* :  forces operations and also checking to see if Hamas was responsible because of course while
*09:33.780- 09:40.160* :  tank shells were initially blamed by the UN for this attack. Later on they changed that to
*09:40.160- 09:44.540* :  shells. If it was Hamas they could have been firing mortar shells in the area. It's still not clear.
*09:44.940- 09:50.220* :  And David Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary is in the region having a series of meetings and
*09:50.420- 09:55.620* :  it seems the UK is the latest ally to add pressure publicly on his round. It's prime minister
*09:56.400- 10:01.420* :  to bring about what they call I think an immediate humanitarian pause and also get more aid in
*10:01.420- 10:06.320* :  more quickly to Gaza. Yeah, you detect a bit of a shift in British policy here. The foreign
*10:06.320- 10:11.400* :  secretary's been talking about the need for humanitarian pause to stop the intense fighting.
*10:11.400- 10:15.920* :  What's new is he's also talking about how this should lead into a longer term cease fire. So
*10:15.920- 10:20.760* :  basically this should be the beginning of a stop to the war. Interesting that that is something
*10:20.760- 10:26.500* :  that reports have said Qatar and Egypt as mediators have been suggesting to delegations from
*10:26.500- 10:31.560* :  Israel and Hamas as they've been overseeing these indirect talks and they've laid out a plan
*10:31.560- 10:36.920* :  we're told for a new deal bringing a cease fire and the release of the remaining 100 plus
*10:36.920- 10:42.400* :  Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Your land now speaking to us from Jerusalem.
*10:43.340- 10:48.580* :  Now the Austrian man who was jailed for life after imprisoning and raping his own daughter could
*10:48.580- 10:54.260* :  be transferred from a psychiatric hospital to a normal prison. Lawyers for Joseph Fritzel who
*10:54.260- 10:59.360* :  fathered seven children by his daughter say it could pave the way for him to apply eventually
*10:59.360- 11:05.560* :  for release to a nursing home from Vienna his Bethany Bell. Joseph Fritzel is now 88 years old
*11:05.560- 11:11.680* :  and has dementia. The court ruling follows a new psychiatric report which said that he no longer
*11:11.680- 11:17.860* :  poses a danger. The judges said he could be moved into a regular prison but they ruled out his
*11:17.860- 11:24.160* :  release and transfer to a care home. The decision by the court in the town of Krems under Donau
*11:24.160- 11:30.100* :  is subject to appeal. For the moment Joseph Fritzel who's changed his name will remain in the
*11:30.100- 11:35.840* :  secure psychiatric unit pending the appeal. We're going to look now at the crimes of two men in
*11:35.840- 11:39.940* :  different parts of the world both of which have resulted in the most serious of sentences
*11:39.940- 11:46.180* :  their execution. One started a fire that killed dozens of people at a film studio in Kyoto
*11:46.720- 11:52.060* :  another shot a woman in a gun for hire killing in Alabama. Both of these cases have stoked debate
*11:52.060- 11:57.780* :  about capital punishment but for different reasons. First then to Japan where a court has sentenced
*11:57.780- 12:05.740* :  Shinji Ayoba to death for an arson attack on an animation studio in 2019 that left 36 people dead.
*12:06.140- 12:10.180* :  Most of them were trapped in the building that he had set fire to. It was one of Japan's worst
*12:10.180- 12:16.780* :  ever murder cases. A correspondent there is Shama Khalil. Shinji Ayoba had burst into the studio
*12:16.780- 12:22.820* :  in July 2019 during a work day. He splashed petrol on the ground floor of that building
*12:23.680- 12:30.380* :  setting it to light and that meant that the fire then trapped people on the top floor 36 of whom
*12:30.860- 12:36.360* :  had died and all the while as he was doing that he was saying drop dead drop dead.
*12:37.200- 12:45.520* :  He said when he was speaking to the court years later he said I had no other option but to do what I
*12:45.520- 12:53.900* :  did at the time but of course this then led to one of Japan's worst ever not only arson attacks but
*12:54.380- 13:01.340* :  mass murder attacks something that still shocks the nation every time that story is relived every
*13:01.340- 13:06.500* :  time it comes up with another development in the court you feel this outpouring especially from
*13:06.500- 13:13.560* :  anime fans on social media on x formerly known as twitter because remember most of the 36 people
*13:13.560- 13:20.360* :  who died where anime artists animators who are held in such high regard here and this particular
*13:20.360- 13:26.380* :  studio this building is a beloved one nationwide. Can you just give us a little insight into that
*13:27.060- 13:32.620* :  I suppose cult for want of a better word of anime in Japan and how significant it is to
*13:32.620- 13:38.640* :  Japanese society. This is something that is synonymous to Japan this is a huge industry right now
*13:38.640- 13:46.440* :  whether it's the anime comic books or anime anime cartoons or videos it has a huge following here
*13:46.440- 13:53.660* :  in Japan and all over the world and the tragedy has not only shocked people in its nature and the
*13:53.660- 13:58.300* :  way that it had happened in the way that it was executed but also what it hit it hit the heart
*13:59.020- 14:04.400* :  of culture here if you will and that's why for example today looking at x formerly known as twitter
*14:04.400- 14:12.020* :  you see people for example reacting to the verdict saying look I'm sorry about the death sentence
*14:12.020- 14:18.280* :  that he's gotten given how trouble he is as a person but this was the right one those people
*14:18.280- 14:26.300* :  those animators who died someone said on x were gods to me. Well from the case of Shinji Ioba let's
*14:26.300- 14:32.740* :  look now at the case of Kenneth Smith a man who has already survived one attempt to execute him by
*14:32.740- 14:37.600* :  the authorities in the southern newer state of Alabama he's due to be put to death at some point
*14:37.600- 14:43.560* :  on Thursday for murdering a woman in the 1980s but it's the way that the state intends to kill him
*14:43.560- 14:49.800* :  that has proved so contentious after trying but failing to execute him already by lethal injection
*14:49.800- 14:55.400* :  two years ago the state government now wants to use nitrogen gas to end his life that would be
*14:55.400- 15:01.720* :  a first in the US our correspondent Tom Bateman sent this report. Kenneth Eugene Smith has spent three
*15:01.720- 15:08.720* :  decades on death row he's already dodged death once his execution has botched an attempt to kill him
*15:08.720- 15:16.120* :  by lethal injection and now he faces suffocation by the state. Opponents see this as a crucial
*15:16.120- 15:22.860* :  test case an urging Alabama's governor to stop it led by Smith's spiritual advisor who will be
*15:22.860- 15:29.580* :  in the execution chamber with him. So I need some assurance that this is safe so this right here
*15:29.580- 15:37.800* :  is an invitation to governor ivy to accompany me into the execution chamber it was two weeks ago
*15:37.800- 15:44.900* :  today. Smith was convicted in 1989 for his part in the murder of Elizabeth senate the wife of a
*15:44.900- 15:51.240* :  preacher who paid Smith a thousand dollars the jury said he should get life in jail but the judge
*15:51.240- 15:58.460* :  sentenced him to death. One medical expert against capital punishment explains that inhaling pure
*15:58.460- 16:05.260* :  nitrogen will starve the body of oxygen but could cause catastrophic mishaps. It's very likely if he
*16:05.260- 16:11.440* :  doesn't die he could be significantly injured by this experience and for that matter so could other
*16:11.440- 16:17.680* :  people in the proximity of Kenneth Smith because the nitrogen gas some of it will be exhaled along
*16:17.680- 16:23.140* :  with carbon dioxide some of it may leak out of the mass. The victims family backs the death penalty
*16:23.720- 16:29.440* :  Alabama's governor's office claims the method has been thoroughly vetted saying it is ready to move
*16:29.440- 16:34.520* :  forward although the authorities haven't presented any plausible evidence of its safety.
*16:35.480- 16:40.900* :  So far urgent calls for a state of execution including from the UN have not been heated
*16:41.720- 16:48.520* :  and Smith awaits death for a second time. Many US states have been moving away from carrying out
*16:48.520- 16:55.440* :  executions. Alabama remains an outlier and today's case is supercharging America's debate
*16:56.040- 16:59.140* :  over state-sanction death. Tom Bateman in the US.
*17:02.060- 17:06.260* :  Now I'm going to apologize in advance for this but still to come on the global news podcast. Why
*17:06.260- 17:13.820* :  this sound? Oh it's white noise. Why is it good for mushrooms? Well it's unbearable for us but
*17:23.780- 17:27.080* :  apparently it helps them grow. Welcome back to the global news podcast. Now which football club
*17:27.080- 17:32.020* :  generates the most money? It's been Manchester City for a while but now the Abu Dhabi-owned
*17:32.020- 17:37.140* :  English Premier League champions have been overtaken by Real Madrid the Spanish club which is owned
*17:37.140- 17:42.300* :  by its fans is the wealthiest according to the annual football money league produced by the
*17:42.300- 17:49.120* :  consulting firm Deloitte. Real's revenue was $921 million last season. Manchester City's was
*17:49.120- 17:55.240* :  a little less about $7 million less. Tim Bridge is from Deloitte. We've got Real Madrid at the top
*17:55.260- 17:59.500* :  for the first time in a couple of years. Of course everybody knows Real Madrid are one of the
*17:59.500- 18:05.400* :  biggest brands globally in football. They've had record retail sales this year that have kind of
*18:05.400- 18:10.620* :  propelled them above Manchester City who had the best season that you could probably possibly have
*18:10.620- 18:16.320* :  on pitch. Manchester City is slightly limited by size of their stadium and the matchday revenue
*18:16.320- 18:22.020* :  that they generate and then up into third place Paris Saint-Germain who benefited from investment
*18:22.020- 18:27.660* :  actually into the club through the French league from the from the private equity house CBC which
*18:27.660- 18:33.420* :  is a trend that we're seeing across sport, that external investment. More broadly these eight
*18:33.420- 18:37.520* :  Premier League clubs that are in the in the top 20 this year and that that actually might be a
*18:37.520- 18:40.880* :  little bit of a surprise to people because for a number of years we've talked about the dominance
*18:40.880- 18:46.220* :  of the Premier League, the rest of your really fighting back in terms of its ability to compete
*18:46.220- 18:51.640* :  financially. As we will always say there is real evidence of polarization financially within
*18:51.640- 18:58.160* :  football. The need to think about better distribution or the best way to distribute the financial
*18:58.160- 19:03.620* :  wealth across the game remains really front of mind and our dates are just shows that that's
*19:04.400- 19:08.320* :  also some interesting notes in your numbers about growth in the women's game commercial wise as
*19:08.320- 19:14.640* :  well. Yeah absolutely and that's a such an interesting finding this year. We've looked at the
*19:15.160- 19:22.260* :  the top 15 clubs across across European football in in the women's game and the growth is really
*19:22.260- 19:26.280* :  significant and the women's game I think we shouldn't be shy in really thinking about how
*19:27.260- 19:32.040* :  yet we hope that broadcast revenue grows but fundamentally it may be a slightly different
*19:32.500- 19:37.160* :  business model that underpins the growth of the women's game in the future and that
*19:37.680- 19:42.980* :  commercial revenue line bringing forward the athlete telling the story of those females that
*19:42.980- 19:48.020* :  are playing at the at the top of elite sport could be the real driver that that kicks the women's
*19:48.020- 19:53.540* :  game on. That was Tim Bridge speaking to Will Bain well as you heard the two of them discussing
*19:54.340- 19:59.780* :  women's football is part of the growth in revenue for Rayal Madrid and remember Spain's women
*19:59.780- 20:04.380* :  are the world champions but their victory last year was overshadowed by the moment that the
*20:04.380- 20:10.680* :  man in charge of Spanish football forcibly kissed a player. It led to the end of the career of
*20:10.680- 20:15.560* :  Luis Rubiales as a football administrator and now a judge has ruled that he should face a
*20:15.560- 20:21.520* :  criminal trial for sexual assault. The judge also said that he and three other officials should
*20:21.520- 20:27.180* :  face coercion charges after the televised moment when Jenny Hermosa was kissed she says against
*20:27.740- 20:32.220* :  her will. So has the judge's decision come as a surprise? Well here's our reporter in Spain
*20:32.280- 20:37.620* :  Guy Hitchcock. I don't think it's unexpected given all the attention that Luis Rubiales has
*20:37.620- 20:43.660* :  received in the fact that this was such a a public kiss and there was so much criticism of him
*20:44.820- 20:50.760* :  at the time and that we saw prosecutors pursue this investigation almost immediately after it
*20:50.760- 20:56.700* :  happened. Now the charges Mr. Rubiales would face in this trial offer sexual assault for that
*20:56.700- 21:02.820* :  kiss that he gave Jenny and Mossort straight after the final and also charges of coercion because
*21:03.280- 21:08.300* :  the allegation is that he tried to persuade Jenny and Mossort to play down the importance of the
*21:08.300- 21:14.040* :  kiss and to come out publicly and say that it had been consensual after it happened and those
*21:14.040- 21:21.760* :  allegations of coercion are also leveled at these three members of the federation or former members
*21:21.760- 21:27.180* :  of the federation in some cases who are seen as allies and Mr. Rubiales and they include the
*21:27.180- 21:31.680* :  former women's national coach, Jorge Vilda, who was the coach of the national team when they
*21:31.680- 21:38.560* :  won the World Cup. And those others were accused of not really a cover-up but essentially acting
*21:38.560- 21:44.060* :  in a conspiracy allegedly to get her to say things that she will say just weren't true.
*21:44.420- 21:48.960* :  Yes that's right I mean in the immediate aftermath of the World Cup final this
*21:49.700- 21:55.700* :  kiss really overshadowed the celebrations that followed it and the controversy
*21:56.260- 22:02.880* :  became so huge so quickly that Mr. Rubiales appears to have realised that this was going to be
*22:02.880- 22:09.940* :  very bad for his image and the allegation is and he does deny this that he tried to get these
*22:09.940- 22:16.620* :  members of the the federation and the the national coach to help him try and exert pressure on
*22:17.020- 22:22.680* :  either directly or through her family in one case through her brother to try and persuade them
*22:22.680- 22:28.100* :  that it was in her interest to come out and say there was this was no problem this was all
*22:28.100- 22:34.520* :  consensual I wasn't bothered by this at all. So those three, Jorge Vilda and also Albert Luque
*22:34.520- 22:41.460* :  and Ruben Rivera will go on trial as well for those coercion charges. Now 150 years after they were
*22:41.460- 22:46.760* :  looted from Ghana by British soldiers items holding huge cultural and religious importance
*22:47.380- 22:51.520* :  are heading back to the country for the first time. In a landmark agreement the British
*22:51.520- 22:56.840* :  Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum both of them here in London are returning them
*22:57.100- 23:00.440* :  on loan to Ghana. Our cultural editor Katie Razzle has more.
*23:02.520- 23:09.100* :  These all came from the British raid on Kumasi in 1874. Kumasi in the south of modern day Ghana
*23:09.440- 23:14.400* :  was the capital of the Ashanti Empire which was in repeated conflict with the British in the 19th
*23:14.400- 23:22.980* :  century. This is a peace pipe when Ashanti kings got together to make peace. Angus Patterson is
*23:22.980- 23:28.060* :  senior curator of metalwork at the V&A. He's showing me some of the items which are being returned
*23:28.060- 23:35.720* :  to Ghana. This is made of gold which was extremely common in the Ashanti court. You can pick that
*23:35.720- 23:42.100* :  one up if you wish. That is heavy. What I'm holding is a pendant of cast gold decorated with
*23:42.100- 23:48.280* :  concentric bands and coming to a point in the middle. British soldiers looted the regalia in 1874
*23:48.280- 23:54.480* :  from the palace of the Ashanti king the Asanthahini in Kumasi. This which is the beaten gold which
*23:54.480- 24:00.100* :  is incredibly fragile. Also with me is the director of the V&A Tristram Hunt. You can see the tear and
*24:00.100- 24:04.560* :  that's because of the kind of violence with which it was ripped out of the ornaments by the British
*24:05.040- 24:10.900* :  troops so there's a symbol in itself of the way in which these items entered the collection.
*24:10.940- 24:17.280* :  Their complex objects are complex. The V&A has agreed to send these 17 pieces back to Ghana.
*24:17.280- 24:22.420* :  They'll go on long-term loan to the Menchipalus Museum. They will come back to the UK and then
*24:22.420- 24:27.960* :  they will go back to Ghana as well. Is this restitution by the back door? This isn't restitution by
*24:27.960- 24:32.220* :  the back door because we're governed by an act which means that the Victorian Albert Museum
*24:32.220- 24:36.680* :  cannot de-accession it's called. It cannot restitute its collections.
*24:38.720- 24:44.260* :  Luted Ashanti gold is as precious to Ghana as the Benin bronzes art in Nigeria. The agreement
*24:44.260- 24:48.800* :  isn't with the Ghanaian government but instead with the Tumpfot Osay tutu the second,
*24:48.800- 24:54.320* :  the current Asanthahini. The Ashanti built a formidable empire steeped in gold. The deal's
*24:54.320- 25:00.580* :  chief negotiator is either Agimandia. There's so much interest in these items. Is there still
*25:00.580- 25:07.620* :  in Ghana a huge anger about the raid in 1874? There is anger. Anytime it comes up,
*25:08.140- 25:14.620* :  people look at it in colonial attempts. Luting of items, pressure of items belonging to people,
*25:15.280- 25:20.100* :  attempts that they don't easily forget. Is the fact that you're taking them on loan a problem?
*25:20.560- 25:25.320* :  It's not really a problem. At least these objects will be home after 150 years.
*25:25.860- 25:31.940* :  For a lot of people it's going to be incredibly problematic. Nana Aforiata Iyim is an advisor to
*25:31.940- 25:37.560* :  Ghana on reparation and restitution. She says politically the Ghanaian government couldn't have made
*25:37.560- 25:42.820* :  a loan deal like this. No, I think it would have just sent out a terrible message in a way.
*25:43.460- 25:49.580* :  I mean the metaphor is someone comes into your home and steals something from your house.
*25:50.400- 25:55.460* :  Keeps it in their house and then you know X amount of years later comes and says I'm going to
*25:55.460- 26:02.200* :  lend you your thing bag. It's nonsensical. So this is a way to get the items back on display without
*26:03.100- 26:07.580* :  having to involve the government because the deal could be done with the Ashantiini. Yeah yeah
*26:07.860- 26:11.740* :  and also obviously the law can be changed. I mean we saw it with the Holocaust items. There is
*26:12.120- 26:17.500* :  a precedent for the law being changed. As well as the VNA, the British Museum is
*26:17.500- 26:23.780* :  loaning 15 items including a cast gold Ashanti sort of state. The returning Ashanti gold pieces
*26:24.100- 26:27.940* :  which haven't been seen in Ghana since they were looted will go on display there in April.
*26:28.800- 26:33.300* :  Katie Razzle with beautiful things that you can see and you can feel as well but what about those
*26:33.300- 26:39.120* :  that you can hear? Well nature is just full of wonderful noises isn't it but what about this?
*26:39.340- 26:49.580* :  OK I think that's enough of that. Well not exactly that sound white noise has been found to help
*26:49.580- 26:56.120* :  fungi grow faster. Even though we struggle with it it could also help lead to ways to speed up
*26:56.120- 27:01.280* :  composting and restoring habitat. Now the man behind the research is Jake Robinson of Flinders
*27:01.280- 27:05.500* :  University in Adelaide in Australia and he's been speaking to my colleague Nick Robinson.
*27:05.940- 27:10.440* :  There's some evidence to suggest that sound waves could stimulate the growth of microorganisms
*27:10.440- 27:15.700* :  so we wanted to know if we could apply sound waves to then change the decomposition rate in soil.
*27:16.320- 27:20.820* :  And it worked and it worked. We found it actually increased the biomass to increase the
*27:20.820- 27:26.100* :  fungal biomass in tea bags, the humble tea bag which is an understated tool in scientific
*27:26.680- 27:30.620* :  experiments. You plant the tea bags in some soil and then blast some sounds at them and then see
*27:30.620- 27:35.040* :  if it has an effect on the fungal growth. That was the first part of the study and the second part
*27:35.040- 27:39.880* :  of the study after we found these results. We wanted to know if we could culture certain fungi
*27:39.880- 27:44.700* :  that were known to be beneficial for plants and then see if this same effect happened again and
*27:44.700- 27:50.180* :  it did. The actual sounds increased the growth of fungi in petri dishes. Are you simply replicating
*27:50.180- 27:53.960* :  what's happening in the natural work? Because we talked on the programme a while back about the
*27:53.960- 27:59.180* :  extraordinary soundscape of natural soil that the earth worms, the ants and all the rest
*27:59.620- 28:03.160* :  do produce sound. Is that what you're doing or are you going to stage further?
*28:03.640- 28:07.100* :  From one perspective we're trying to see if we can experiment with different sound parameters
*28:07.580- 28:13.120* :  to then see if we can speed up the restoration process in soil. So sort of like 75 cent of
*28:13.120- 28:17.980* :  soils across the world are currently degraded. So we're trying to repair them by stimulating them
*28:17.980- 28:22.740* :  with sounds. From another perspective you know there's a global rise in noise pollution as well.
*28:22.820- 28:27.420* :  So we want to see if there are any effect negative effects on the soil from these harmful sounds
*28:27.420- 28:32.180* :  potentially as well. Quite tricky to scale object though if you conclude it works. I mean it's all
*28:32.180- 28:37.480* :  very well playing a bit of white noise into a petri dish but how on earth would you do it across
*28:37.480- 28:41.540* :  a field or a landscape? Yes so that's one of the main, that would be one of the main challenges next
*28:41.540- 28:45.960* :  if we wanted to try and stimulate soil would be how we would be able to scale it up. So it might be
*28:45.960- 28:51.520* :  that we put tiny little sensors in the soil next to plants to stimulate the symbiosis between the
*28:51.520- 28:56.760* :  plants and the fungi. Jake Robinson talking to Nick Robinson not related by the way. Now just before
*28:56.760- 29:01.880* :  we go I want you to think back to our early hunter gatherer ancestors who you may think survived
*29:01.880- 29:07.780* :  mostly on a diet of meat. Well researchers in the high Andes mountains in Peru have found that in fact
*29:07.780- 29:13.320* :  we've had it backwards in that part of the world at least. It turns out 80% of what those early
*29:13.320- 29:19.880* :  humans ate was plant-based only 20% was meat. That's according to analysis of the remains of 24
*29:19.880- 29:26.680* :  individuals from two burial sites dating back 9,000 years. Alex Ritson has been speaking to Dr.
*29:26.680- 29:31.960* :  Randy Hass and archaeologist from the University of Wyoming in the US. We use some traditional
*29:31.960- 29:37.120* :  approaches which is just looking at the materials in the archaeological record we looked at plant
*29:37.120- 29:43.220* :  remains and animal bones from these early archaeological sites and that gave us some insights
*29:43.220- 29:49.200* :  into the dietary profiles of these individuals. But the major new method that we applied is human
*29:49.200- 29:55.300* :  bone isotope chemistry where we actually analyze the chemical composition of human bone and basically
*29:55.300- 30:00.760* :  you are what you eat. The chemical makeup of your bone reflects the chemical makeup of the foods
*30:00.760- 30:06.580* :  that you eat at least in broad categories plant foods versus terrestrial animal foods versus fish.
*30:07.160- 30:10.900* :  It was the convergence of these three methods that allowed us to very accurately reconstruct
*30:10.900- 30:17.600* :  these early human diets and determine that they were largely based on plants. This flies in the
*30:17.600- 30:22.860* :  face of what we were all told at school though doesn't it because we were told by our teachers
*30:22.860- 30:29.260* :  that our ancestors started eating lots of meat and that was what gave them the change to become
*30:29.260- 30:35.160* :  the hyper intelligent humans that we are today. Yeah I think that's basically right and in fact
*30:35.160- 30:39.820* :  I am a professor and I have told my students for a long time that early human diets were largely
*30:39.820- 30:45.000* :  meat based. There's good empirical reason to have thought that there are theoretical reasons
*30:45.000- 30:50.380* :  to have thought that but now I'm confronted with some evidence that suggests the contrary
*30:50.380- 30:56.480* :  and there are good reasons to explain the disagreement with earlier and more recent evidence.
*30:56.480- 31:02.260* :  It turns out that when we rely on the material record there are certain kinds of preservation
*31:02.300- 31:08.120* :  biases that result in us preferentially observing hunting related artifacts,
*31:08.900- 31:15.000* :  slithic stone tools, projectile points, they preserve really well animal bone, it preserves real
*31:15.000- 31:21.040* :  well. So we've seen this really strong signature hunting signature but plant foods do not preserve
*31:21.040- 31:25.900* :  very well. So we've had this sort of biased view of the archaeological record at least in this
*31:25.900- 31:30.560* :  part of the world. So briefly tempt me if I'd gone back to caveman times in the area you were
*31:30.560- 31:34.860* :  looking at what would what would have I been enjoying if I'd been invited for dinner.
*31:36.360- 31:41.500* :  So based on our dietary reconstructions from these populations that date from about 9,000 to
*31:41.500- 31:47.920* :  6,500 years ago you probably would have had a large helping of tubers, tubers are the roots
*31:47.920- 31:54.400* :  of certain kinds of plants and very likely these would have been the wild tubers that are related
*31:54.400- 31:59.580* :  to potatoes. Potatoes were actually domesticated in this part of the world but you probably also
*31:59.580- 32:06.720* :  would have gotten at least some portion of vacuña meat or deer meat. Vacuña is the wild ancestor
*32:06.720- 32:12.340* :  to the alpaca. Absent from this diet would have been fish, we don't find any evidence or very little
*32:12.340- 32:17.560* :  evidence of fish consumption in this diet and very little evidence of small mammal consumption or
*32:17.560- 32:24.020* :  bird consumption. And definitely no beef burgers. No beef burgers. Dr. Randy Hass from the University of
*32:24.020- 32:29.940* :  Wyoming. Right that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News
