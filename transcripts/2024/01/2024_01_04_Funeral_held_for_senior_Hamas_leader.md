*01:46.320- 01:53.180* :  I'm Nigel Adely and at 1,400 GMT on Thursday the 4th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:53.980- 01:59.740* :  The funeral of the Hamas deputy leader Salal Al-Aruhri takes place in the Lebanese capital Bay
*01:59.740- 02:04.580* :  route. According to New Yorkers released hundreds of documents from a defamation case
*02:05.120- 02:09.380* :  that names people connected to the lake convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
*02:09.980- 02:15.720* :  Amplans may, by Argentina's president Javier Millet, to inject shock therapy into the economy
*02:16.260- 02:17.380* :  have hit a bump in the road.
*02:20.940- 02:27.860* :  Also in this podcast, we want to see more things, see the outside world and think about what we
*02:27.860- 02:33.140* :  really dream of. How millions of young people in China are struggling to find work.
*02:37.920- 02:43.180* :  To Lebanon where, as we record this podcast, thousands of mourners are paying their final respects
*02:43.180- 02:50.280* :  to the senior Hamas leader killed there on Tuesday. Salal Al-Aruhri, who was a deputy head of Hamas,
*02:50.700- 02:55.800* :  as well as a prominent figure in its armed wing, the Kasem Brigades, was killed in what's
*02:55.800- 03:01.120* :  believed to have been a drone strike. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement
*03:01.120- 03:07.400* :  in the killing. Mr Al-Aruhri has been laid to rest at the Shatila Refugee Camp in West Bay
*03:07.400- 03:11.320* :  a correspondent Karen Torbe sent us this report.
*03:37.180- 03:47.300* :  And other Palestinian factions, as well as flags with Al-Oxah Mosque. They come here in a day
*03:47.300- 03:56.000* :  when there is a lot of concern over whether the killing of Aruhri and six other members of Hamas
*03:56.000- 04:05.480* :  two days ago could trigger some further escalation in the confrontation between Israel and
*04:05.480- 04:15.500* :  Hezbollah, especially that Hezbollah has said that the killing will not go unpunished.
*04:16.380- 04:22.160* :  Karen Torbe on the streets of Beirut, people in Salal Al-Aruhri's birthplace in the occupied
*04:22.160- 04:28.100* :  West Bank have been mourning his death. Our correspondent, Shai McElil, has been hearing their
*04:28.100- 04:33.760* :  reaction to the loss of a man who, for many, remains a powerful symbol of resistance.
*04:40.360- 04:44.020* :  The anger is palpable on the streets of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
*04:44.820- 04:49.400* :  Since Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, protesters have gathered regularly here at Al-Manar
*04:49.400- 04:55.040* :  around about in the city center, but today feels different. After the killing of Hamas's deputy
*04:55.040- 04:58.960* :  leader Salah Al-Aruhri had leavened on, there's been a call for a general strike,
*04:59.620- 05:03.080* :  and from the shuttered shops I see around me, many have heated that call.
*05:07.980- 05:12.480* :  Some protesters are waving Palestinian flags, but I can also see a couple of green Hamas flags.
*05:13.560- 05:18.740* :  Hela Aborbeya has come out from many protests, but she tells me this time there is a new sense of
*05:18.740- 05:27.000* :  loss. We feel a great deal of rage, a fury, and a piercing sadness. Salah Al-Aruhri was not
*05:27.000- 05:33.140* :  just a regular person, he was an exceptional leader, a freedom fighter, an intellectual,
*05:33.540- 05:35.300* :  and we have so much respect for him.
*05:38.300- 05:44.500* :  protesters are now walking through one of Ramallah's streets chanting Salah Al-Aruhri's name,
*05:44.500- 05:50.400* :  chanting for the resistance. He may have been on the U.S.'s and Israel's target list,
*05:50.740- 05:56.320* :  but to the people here he's a symbol of resistance that they've lost. Many have come out here
*05:56.620- 06:01.140* :  to mourn his death, to show support, but also to call for revenge.
*06:04.320- 06:07.220* :  Hisham Aborayah tells me the people here feel abandoned.
*06:07.500- 06:10.960* :  Risalidna, Risalid Hurriyeh!
*06:11.780- 06:17.560* :  Hours is a message of freedom. We are a civilized, educated people who love others,
*06:18.320- 06:21.160* :  but some rights are only obtained through resistance.
*06:27.000- 06:31.960* :  In the nearby village of Aruhra Salah Al-Aruhri's hometown, his family are in mourning and
*06:31.960- 06:36.460* :  have been receiving numerous messages of condolences. He's a local hero here,
*06:37.080- 06:41.220* :  but both Israel and the U.S. say he's responsible for many acts of terror.
*06:42.140- 06:44.540* :  His sister Fatima rejects this defiantly.
*06:49.800- 06:54.620* :  I direct the same question to the Zionists. Terrorism is killing women and children,
*06:55.040- 06:58.280* :  destroying houses and murdering entire families in Gaza.
*07:00.440- 07:05.840* :  Terrorism is when we are safe in our homes, and then we find ourselves in body bags torn
*07:05.840- 07:08.760* :  into pieces from the bombs. Who is the terrorist?
*07:16.980- 07:21.260* :  There's been a tenth anticipation about what the Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah might say
*07:21.260- 07:26.880* :  in response to the death of Al-Aruhri. A man the Iran-backed group has worked with so closely,
*07:26.880- 07:30.820* :  and was killed right in their stronghold, a southern Beirut.
*07:34.860- 07:38.820* :  Yesterday's crime was a major and dangerous crime that cannot be tolerated.
*07:39.560- 07:43.700* :  There isn't much more to be said about it. As we said in Hizbullah's statement yesterday,
*07:44.300- 07:47.580* :  this dangerous crime will not go unanswered and unpunished.
*07:50.860- 07:56.380* :  Hamas and Hizbullah have very close ties and a common enemy. They will have to react what happened.
*07:57.200- 08:02.540* :  Israel, despite neither confirming nor denying its involvement, says it's ready for any scenario.
*08:03.620- 08:07.160* :  Since the war in Gaza started, there has been a growing concern that this conflict
*08:07.620- 08:12.960* :  would spread here in the West Bank and across the region. The fear now is that Salah Al-Aruhri's
*08:12.960- 08:17.140* :  killing could be that trigger. Shah Mekalil in the West Bank
*08:18.000- 08:24.300* :  For many years, the disgraced American financier, Jeffrey Epstein, was seen socializing with powerful
*08:24.300- 08:29.640* :  people, leading figures from Wall Street, celebrities, and even British royalty.
*08:30.360- 08:36.100* :  Now the names of some of the people connected to him have been made public in almost 1,000 pages
*08:36.100- 08:41.680* :  of documents which have been released on the orders of a judge in New York. Among the names are
*08:41.680- 08:47.000* :  the former American presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, although they've not been accused
*08:47.000- 08:53.820* :  of any wrongdoing. Epstein, who killed himself in 2019, was accused of forcing underage girls to
*08:53.820- 09:00.080* :  provide sexual services to him and guests at his homes. At each of Safta is an enterprise
*09:00.080- 09:05.200* :  reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and has been following the story closely. She spoke to James
*09:05.200- 09:11.600* :  Coppnell. These documents pertain to a defamation suit that was filed in 2015 by one of Epstein's
*09:11.600- 09:18.580* :  victims against Galen Maxwell, who was later sentenced to 20 years in prison for helping Epstein
*09:18.580- 09:24.940* :  in his sex trafficking. These documents are now being released because they were asked by journalists
*09:24.940- 09:29.880* :  at the Miami Herald and others to be released and then the judge eventually ruled that too many
*09:29.880- 09:34.440* :  of the names had been redacted because many of them had already appeared in media reports.
*09:35.040- 09:40.820* :  So there has been lots of speculation, lots of interest in the contents of the documents.
*09:41.720- 09:44.660* :  You've been pouring through them. What stands out for you?
*09:45.620- 09:50.180* :  First of all, a lot of the interest is driven by some of the misinformation that's on social media
*09:50.180- 09:54.760* :  where this speculation around this being some kind of an Epstein client list. So I want to first
*09:54.760- 10:00.640* :  clarify that this is not a client list. Some of the Jane Does and John Does are Epstein victims,
*10:00.640- 10:05.720* :  some are former employees, some are people who traveled on Epstein's plane, and other types of
*10:05.720- 10:11.160* :  associates, and some could also be people that have never met Epstein before. So these are just
*10:11.160- 10:15.460* :  court documents and we have to, as you said, pour through them and figure out what's relevant and
*10:15.460- 10:20.340* :  what's new. So some of the names that I've come across are like Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton,
*10:20.340- 10:27.000* :  Donald Trump, Les Waxner, and these are all known associates of Epstein and people whose
*10:27.000- 10:32.700* :  relationship has been documented before. So as you say, no indication of wrongdoing of being in
*10:32.760- 10:38.500* :  the documents, what about people whose names weren't known to have been associated with Epstein
*10:38.500- 10:43.320* :  before? Have any of those come up to your attention? So I'm still making my way through these
*10:43.320- 10:48.360* :  documents. Some of the names that perhaps haven't been known before might be some of Epstein's
*10:48.360- 10:53.800* :  victims because it's not just prominent people. There's people who worked for Epstein that are
*10:53.800- 10:59.240* :  among these names, and there's people who flew on his planes and those types of people as well.
*10:59.760- 11:04.800* :  Among the people who were associates of Epstein rather than victims,
*11:05.540- 11:09.840* :  well those who say the documents don't suggest wrongdoing, it's not necessarily a place
*11:10.260- 11:13.760* :  a well-known person would want to be. Is it among this list of names?
*11:14.740- 11:19.140* :  No, I think everybody at this point wants to distance themselves from Jeffrey Epstein, given
*11:19.140- 11:24.280* :  obviously what he's been accused of. And a lot of people have said to me over the course of my
*11:24.280- 11:28.440* :  reporting that they really regret the relationship or that they didn't know the extent of his crimes
*11:28.440- 11:33.260* :  or that they thought they had rehabilitated himself for those that met him after he was a
*11:33.260- 11:38.400* :  registered sex offender. But just to be clear, there could be instances where some of these
*11:38.400- 11:43.500* :  people are accused of wrongdoing like in a deposition for example, like by a particular victim,
*11:43.500- 11:48.560* :  there could be like an allegation, but it doesn't necessarily mean like the list itself is a list
*11:48.560- 11:54.240* :  of Epstein clients. So where do you think this goes from here? What does this change?
*11:54.980- 11:58.960* :  I think more than anything it just shows the amount of interest that there is still in this case
*11:58.960- 12:03.280* :  and the people that were associating with Epstein. At the Wall Street Journal, we spent the good
*12:03.280- 12:09.560* :  part of a year trying to figure Epstein's VIP circle after he had pleaded guilty in 2008
*12:09.560- 12:14.260* :  to procuring and soliciting a minor for prostitution. So at this point, he was already a registered
*12:14.260- 12:20.180* :  sex offender. And we found that many of the world's most powerful people were still associating
*12:20.180- 12:24.120* :  with him during that time, including people like Bill Gates, who has said he only met him for
*12:24.120- 12:30.480* :  philanthropy and that he regrets the association. And we also found that he was using some of those
*12:30.480- 12:37.220* :  connections, especially during his later years, to lure women that he was abusing. And he was
*12:37.540- 12:41.140* :  claiming that he was going to get them job opportunities and those often didn't pan out.
*12:42.120- 12:48.480* :  Hadid Yasafta. Argentina's radical new president, Javier Millet, had hope to inject
*12:48.480- 12:54.260* :  shock therapy into the economy when he was elected in November. The country is currently
*12:54.260- 13:00.500* :  suffering high inflation and nearly 40% of people live in poverty. But his plans to change labor
*13:00.500- 13:06.800* :  laws have hit a setback. Here's our business correspondent, Nick Marsh. When he came into office,
*13:06.800- 13:14.640* :  Javier Millet, he said that he'd be revamping completely regenerating the Argentinian economy,
*13:14.640- 13:21.440* :  this package of radical reforms to fix these kind of deep rooted issues in Argentina. He wanted
*13:21.440- 13:28.500* :  to slash the public workforce, really cut down on government spending. But now he's faced his
*13:28.500- 13:34.980* :  first obstacle and that comes in the form of the country's judiciary. So the courts have said
*13:34.980- 13:40.340* :  that these labor laws that he wants to introduce, so things like making it easier to fire employees,
*13:40.340- 13:45.820* :  reduce compensation if you fire them, cut maternity leave, all these things that would really favor
*13:45.820- 13:51.860* :  the employer. The judges basically say you can't do that. You need the approval of parliament,
*13:51.860- 13:56.800* :  you can't just force these strings through by decree. And they've also called the proposed
*13:56.800- 14:02.280* :  laws punitive and repressive and they say that they've questioned the necessity of them basically.
*14:02.280- 14:07.980* :  So the Argentinian government now says it will appeal, but it could be the beginning of a long
*14:07.980- 14:14.120* :  battle if Javier Millet wants to get through all of these radical plans. He is so radical in his
*14:14.120- 14:20.280* :  libertarianism. So he really believes in the free market, in the private sector's ability to
*14:20.280- 14:26.020* :  solve problems, deregulation. He calls himself an anarcho-capitalist. So that's a bit different
*14:26.020- 14:31.740* :  really for a G20 leader. I haven't seen anything like this before. And this shock therapy that he's
*14:31.740- 14:36.860* :  proposing is going to be difficult for the most vulnerable in society because it's extreme austerity.
*14:37.020- 14:40.360* :  Basically, you're cutting fuel subsidies, you're cutting transport subsidies,
*14:40.360- 14:45.000* :  you're removing caps on rent. His government admits it's going to get worse before it gets better,
*14:45.680- 14:48.880* :  but we've already seen protests and now we've seen challenges in the courts as well.
*14:49.620- 14:54.800* :  Nick Marsh reporting on Argentina where the International Monetary Fund will make a visit today
*14:54.860- 15:01.700* :  to continue negotiations over the country's debt load. With a $44 billion loan program,
*15:01.700- 15:07.640* :  the country is the largest debtor to the fund. There's some good news about what
*15:07.640- 15:14.000* :  scientists agree is one of the greatest threats we all face, from bacteria that are resistant to
*15:14.000- 15:20.600* :  drugs. Scientists in the US believe they found an entirely new class of antibiotic that appears
*15:20.600- 15:26.520* :  to kill one particularly lethal organism. Professor Laura Piedek is scientific director
*15:26.520- 15:32.520* :  at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership. Nick Robinson asked her what she
*15:32.520- 15:38.860* :  made with the research which is published in the journal Nature. It is exciting. Not only is this a
*15:38.860- 15:44.560* :  new antibiotic that they've shown works extremely well in the test tube and they've now shown how it
*15:44.860- 15:51.040* :  works at the biochemical level in this paper in nature, but there's a second paper in nature as
*15:51.040- 15:58.680* :  well from the drug company that shows that it works well in mice and will kill infections when
*15:58.700- 16:04.320* :  they're in that model as well as in the test tubes. This is very exciting. Well tell us what the
*16:04.320- 16:11.140* :  bug is that this new antibiotic is dealing with. The organism is called Carbapenem resistant
*16:11.140- 16:20.220* :  aceneter-bacter-bomanii and this is what we call a gram-negative bacterium. It has two types of
*16:20.220- 16:26.400* :  membrane to it which makes it very difficult to get drugs into it and get drugs to stay inside
*16:27.200- 16:33.980* :  and what's exciting about this discovery is that one of the building blocks that a part of the
*16:33.980- 16:41.740* :  outer part of this bacterial cell is disrupted by this new drug so it makes it more susceptible to
*16:41.740- 16:49.220* :  other antibiotics as well. Now how far are we if we're reading a paper in nature it's about experiments
*16:49.220- 16:55.320* :  on animals. How far are we from this being used in hospitals to save people's lives? We're a very
*16:55.320- 17:02.840* :  long way. What is exciting is that the company have already done some first-in-man studies that's
*17:02.840- 17:09.400* :  to check that it's sort of safe to use in people so they are set up now to go on and do full
*17:09.400- 17:17.260* :  clinical trials in people with the infection but these take a long time several years and even
*17:17.260- 17:24.760* :  if the trial is successful then the drug has to be approved for use and then made accessible to those
*17:25.320- 17:30.680* :  that need it and that's all over the world not just in a few countries that can afford it
*17:31.260- 17:37.360* :  and therein is the big problem the economics of making antibiotics. But just in a word if you
*17:37.360- 17:43.800* :  would there is hope. Oh definite hope it's really exciting and not only is it good for this type of
*17:43.800- 17:49.700* :  bacteria but this could be built upon for others as well. Laura Pidik, scientific director at the
*17:49.700- 17:57.960* :  Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership. Still to come the group campaigning to
*17:57.960- 18:04.960* :  exonerate people accused of witchcraft. We need to learn lessons from the witch trials of the past
*18:04.960- 18:16.700* :  so we can stop this witch hunting. Unmissible stories from around the globe. If there's a
*18:16.700- 18:23.540* :  war or any emergency happening to Taiwan then you know I would be also part of it. The documentary
*18:23.660- 18:30.780* :  gripping storytelling from the BBC World Service. This has been our life since childhood every year
*18:30.780- 18:38.260* :  worse and difficult events. The documentary is a vantage point from which to survey a new horizon.
*18:38.860- 18:42.440* :  Search for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:46.680- 18:52.820* :  Millions of young people in China are struggling to find a job as the economic downturn in the country
*18:52.820- 18:59.580* :  has resulted in historically high youth unemployment. More than one in five people between the ages of
*18:59.580- 19:05.840* :  16 and 24 are jobless in China although it's now difficult to know the real numbers after the
*19:05.840- 19:11.060* :  country stopped releasing the figures. Fixing that crisis could be one of the biggest challenges
*19:11.060- 19:17.860* :  facing the government in 2024. Our China correspondent Laura Bicker has been to the southwest of the
*19:17.860- 19:21.460* :  country to meet recent graduates and found out how they're coping.
*19:22.900- 19:31.080* :  Hello my name is Joy welcome to Chengdu. Joy came to Chengdu from a rural village to study. At 23
*19:31.080- 19:38.600* :  she is the first in her family to go to university. Like most of her classmates she hasn't found a
*19:38.600- 19:44.580* :  full-time job. Do you think it's more difficult now than when your parents were growing up to get a
*19:44.580- 19:53.600* :  job? Yes. The fact is there are lots of jobs. The problem is they offer low salaries and you
*19:53.600- 19:57.460* :  are easily replaceable. What about your parents? Have they been a little worried?
*19:59.240- 20:04.360* :  Yes they do. They expect me to have a better life and a better job and an income than their
*20:04.360- 20:10.380* :  generation. So we're at a job fair just on the edge of Beijing. It does look a bit like speed
*20:10.380- 20:16.520* :  dating with recruiters. You've got people sitting behind desk explaining what they do, everything
*20:16.520- 20:24.440* :  from selling insurance or perhaps working with the elderly. Those opportunities are not ideal
*20:24.440- 20:30.960* :  for recent graduate Chengdu. But you're a software engineer so I would imagine that your skills
*20:30.960- 20:37.840* :  are in demand. The skills are hotly sought after and therefore there were too many people.
*20:38.140- 20:46.460* :  Many are looking for jobs, not many found jobs. But some believe this jobs crisis will pass.
*20:47.980- 20:54.220* :  I think the difficulties are just temporary. People with real capabilities where find jobs.
*20:55.500- 21:01.360* :  For decades young people in China were taught that if they work hard, study hard, it will aid the
*21:01.360- 21:08.420* :  country's economic miracle. But as that miracle falters, this unwritten social contract no longer
*21:08.420- 21:13.800* :  stands and the Communist Party may fear that a disillusioned youth will pose a threat.
*21:14.740- 21:20.820* :  Social media has coined a nickname, lying flat, for young people frustrated by the competition
*21:20.940- 21:26.980* :  of modern life. But sitting out the ailing job market is not an option for all.
*21:31.220- 21:36.240* :  23-year-old Zeng Gu Ling and her boyfriend like to play pool in their free time.
*21:36.980- 21:42.740* :  She has a marketing degree and after a few months of searching, she's taken a job in customer service.
*21:43.360- 21:49.700* :  Both she and her boyfriend want to work, but years of Covid lockdowns have changed their
*21:49.700- 21:54.980* :  outlook on life. Do you think the job market at the moment is difficult for your generation?
*21:57.500- 22:04.000* :  Yes, very difficult. After Covid, the economy is not good. When I went to the job fairs,
*22:04.400- 22:10.660* :  I found that most companies only recruit for salespeople. There are very few companies and
*22:10.660- 22:17.560* :  very few suitable positions. Do you think there's a difference in the kind of dreams that you have
*22:17.560- 22:20.640* :  and what you want from life rather than career?
*22:20.940- 22:28.460* :  My parents are less educated. The things they've encountered, the places they've visited,
*22:29.020- 22:34.200* :  are few unlimited. They've never left their home province. They just want to stable life,
*22:34.320- 22:41.260* :  but we want to see more things, see the outside world and think about what we really dream of.
*22:48.380- 22:53.360* :  As China's older generation enjoy their well-earned mornings in the park, joining choirs
*22:53.360- 22:59.140* :  or taking dancing lessons, this country's young generation is adjusting its expectations.
*22:59.340- 23:03.440* :  The Communist Youth League urge them to take off their suits, roll up their sleeves,
*23:03.840- 23:09.440* :  and go to the farmland. But many young people seem to be hoping that a very different way of life.
*23:11.180- 23:16.800* :  Laura Baker reporting. The mysteries surrounding historical witch hunts in the United States
*23:16.800- 23:23.820* :  have cast a spell over people for nearly four centuries. In 1648, Margaret Jones and midwife
*23:23.820- 23:30.220* :  became the first person in Massachusetts to be executed for witchcraft decades before the infamous
*23:30.740- 23:37.220* :  Salem Witch Trials. Now the Massachusetts Witch Hunt Justice project is hoping to persuade the
*23:37.220- 23:42.380* :  state to take a fuller reckoning of its early history. James Coppnell has been speaking to the
*23:42.380- 23:48.840* :  group's leader, Josh Hutchinson, about how neighbor turned on neighbor. There was a lot of
*23:49.320- 23:57.000* :  economic uncertainty, political and military instability, even religious conflict within
*23:57.860- 24:05.060* :  Massachusetts. And that was putting a lot of pressure from outside on communities that inside were
*24:05.060- 24:12.600* :  also experiencing, you know, neighborly discord. And those two factors combined caused a lot of
*24:12.600- 24:19.440* :  people to search for, you know, explanations why bad things were happening. What did it take to
*24:19.440- 24:27.280* :  convince a jury a court that someone was a witch? That varied over time, but a lot had to do with
*24:28.240- 24:34.300* :  spectral evidence, especially in the Salem Witch Trials, where a person could come in
*24:34.300- 24:41.840* :  and claim that they were being bewitched and that they were seeing basically a spectral image
*24:42.820- 24:50.720* :  of an attacker coming after them and they would act out this affliction in court and that would
*24:50.720- 24:57.040* :  often convince the jurors. So fast forward to now, what are you trying to achieve? We're trying
*24:57.040- 25:06.020* :  to get exoneration for eight individuals who were convicted of witchcraft in Boston outside of the
*25:06.020- 25:15.300* :  Salem Witch Hunt in the years 1648 to 1688. And we're also trying to get an apology from the state
*25:15.300- 25:21.920* :  of Massachusetts to all victims of the witch hunts, 200 some individuals, whether they were
*25:21.920- 25:29.380* :  prosecuted in Boston or in Salem. Why is it important to you to write a wrong from so many years ago?
*25:30.140- 25:38.860* :  To me, there's a personal aspect in that some of my ancestors and other close relations were involved
*25:38.860- 25:46.900* :  in these witch trials. I have some six dozen or more ancestors and immediate family involved in
*25:46.900- 25:54.460* :  the Salem Witch Trials alone, including one who was hanged, Mary Este, and I want to see justice
*25:54.960- 26:03.560* :  on her behalf and for all the other descendants of the victims. And I also care that we continue to
*26:03.560- 26:11.620* :  behave in this way of witch hunting each other today. And we need to learn lessons from the
*26:11.620- 26:17.780* :  witch trials of the past so we can stop this witch hunting. Josh Hutchinson speaking to James
*26:17.780- 26:23.920* :  Coppnell. Here's some good advice if you're going on a fishing trip, always wear a watch.
*26:24.680- 26:29.780* :  Without it, a man who fell overboard off the coast of New Zealand's North Island might never have
*26:29.780- 26:35.460* :  been saved. He spent nearly 24 hours in the sea. From Sydney, here's Phil Messer.
*26:36.120- 26:41.720* :  The fisherman was saved by his watch. He used it to reflect the sun to attract the attention
*26:41.720- 26:48.620* :  of three men who were fishing out to see off New Zealand's North Islands. They investigated the
*26:48.620- 26:55.260* :  unusual glimmer of light and found the man cold and exhausted in the water. The police say that
*26:55.260- 27:01.520* :  during his ordeal he briefly encountered a shark. He'd fallen overboard after catching a large
*27:01.520- 27:09.300* :  fish before seeing his boat slowly disappear. The man reportedly told his rescuers that he was
*27:09.300- 27:18.180* :  glad to see them. Phil Messer. Finally, a 13-year-old boy from Oklahoma is believed to become the first
*27:18.180- 27:25.440* :  human to beat Nintendo's classic video game Tetris. Only AI software are got to the so-called
*27:25.840- 27:32.420* :  kill screen before. Reporter David Lewis and one time Game Boy owner has been following the story.
*27:35.400- 27:41.260* :  It's the retro game of lightning fast fingers and budging blocks, and now Willis Gibson can
*27:41.260- 27:47.240* :  claim to be the best Tetris player in the world. The teenager posted a video of himself patiently
*27:47.240- 27:55.360* :  progressing round by round for 38 minutes before reaching level 157. The game's so-called kill
*27:55.360- 28:01.440* :  screen when the shape stopped falling and the screen freezes. This was the moment it happened.
*28:06.860- 28:12.460* :  I'm going to pass out. I can't feel my fingers. He said falling back in his chair.
*28:13.100- 28:18.040* :  It's an extraordinary achievement. Up until relatively recently, it was believed it was only
*28:18.040- 28:25.060* :  possible to play up to level 29, but competitive players found a way. In 2010, Game of Thought
*28:25.060- 28:31.780* :  Ackeland got to level 30 using a technique called hypertapping, where he vibrated his fingers in a
*28:31.780- 28:38.440* :  way which moved the controller rapidly. Tetris is originally Russian, created back in the 1980s by
*28:38.440- 28:44.560* :  Soviet engineer Alexei Poshitnov. It gained fame and cult status after being released on Nintendo's
*28:44.560- 28:50.840* :  NES and Game Boy console in 1989. As for Willis Gibson, who goes by the name Blue Scooty Online,
*28:50.840- 28:55.680* :  he's been playing Tetris for two years and has competed in various gaming tournaments.
*28:55.680- 29:02.020* :  He wrote on his YouTube channel, When I started playing this game, I never expected to ever
*29:02.020- 29:06.640* :  crash the game or beat it. David Lewis reporting.
*29:08.940- 29:13.640* :  And that's all for months for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.

*30:22.480- 30:28.180* :  shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Since November, the Iran-backed militia has been attacking vessels
*30:28.180- 30:34.340* :  in this vital shipping route. Why then have the rebels been doing this? And could their attacks
*30:34.340- 30:39.820* :  escalate the wider conflict in the Middle East? The global story brings you fresh insights and
