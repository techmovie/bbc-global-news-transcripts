*00:00.060- 00:04.020* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:04.020- 00:06.580* :  with reports and analysis from across the world,
*00:06.580- 00:08.740* :  the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.620* :  BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:33.200- 00:35.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:37.860- 00:41.000* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on the 8th of January,
*00:41.000- 00:42.440* :  these are our main stories.
*00:42.960- 00:46.280* :  As more American shuttle diplomacy gets underway in the Middle East,
*00:46.580- 00:49.420* :  a senior Hasbola commander has been killed in Lebanon.
*00:49.860- 00:52.820* :  How likely is a wider escalation of violence now?
*00:53.460- 00:58.060* :  A BBC investigation into rape and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest
*00:58.120- 01:00.080* :  Christian evangelical churches.
*01:02.980- 01:08.160* :  Also in this podcast, India's Supreme Court says 11 men convicted of gang rape
*01:08.160- 01:12.960* :  during anti-Muslim riots in 2002 must stay in prison.
*01:13.500- 01:17.840* :  And later, five, four, three, we have ignition.
*01:18.660- 01:23.080* :  A US moon mission takes off aiming to set a lander down on the surface
*01:23.340- 01:24.860* :  the first for more than 50 years.
*01:28.940- 01:34.040* :  Is Hasbola and by extension Lebanon being drawn into a wider conflict with Israel?
*01:34.920- 01:39.020* :  When a drone attack killed a senior Hamas leader in Beirut last week,
*01:39.320- 01:43.040* :  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Shia militant group Hasbola,
*01:43.380- 01:48.040* :  blamed Israel and said a response from his well-armed group was inevitably coming.
*01:48.880- 01:53.460* :  Well now, a senior commander from Hasbola has been killed in a drone attack.
*01:54.220- 01:57.160* :  All this as the US Secretary of State is in the region,
*01:57.160- 02:02.360* :  trying amongst other things to prevent the guards of conflict from spilling over into a broader war.
*02:03.040- 02:07.460* :  Hugo Bashega is our correspondent in Beirut and he told us about this latest attack.
*02:08.280- 02:11.120* :  This happened this morning and the Israeli military said
*02:11.320- 02:14.820* :  we had carried out airstrikes responding to attacks
*02:14.960- 02:17.700* :  that had been launched by Hasbola.
*02:18.360- 02:22.240* :  And it seems that it didn't take very long for Hasbola to respond
*02:22.240- 02:25.660* :  because apparently multiple rockets have been fired from Lebanon
*02:26.140- 02:28.500* :  and sirens have been heard in Northern Israel.
*02:28.720- 02:34.440* :  And this has been the reality here since Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza started.
*02:34.440- 02:40.180* :  These attacks have intensified in recent days and obviously it's very dangerous
*02:40.180- 02:44.160* :  because the fear here is that Lebanon could be dragged into this conflict.
*02:44.160- 02:48.640* :  Israel has been warning Hasbola against escalating the situation.
*02:48.680- 02:54.300* :  It's been threatening a devastating response and I've been covering these attacks
*02:54.300- 02:58.740* :  from the very beginning and I think Hasbola has been calibrating its response
*02:58.740- 03:03.300* :  because it doesn't seem interested in sparking a major conflict with Israel.
*03:03.940- 03:09.020* :  Here in Lebanon there's no public support for any kind of military adventure if you like.
*03:09.480- 03:16.640* :  People still remember the devastation caused by the 2006 war between Hasbola and Israel.
*03:17.280- 03:22.360* :  There is a massive economic crisis here at the moment so people really don't want this to become
*03:22.360- 03:26.000* :  a major conflict but miscalculation is always a risk.
*03:26.200- 03:29.260* :  Yeah you can stumble into a broader escalation, can't you?
*03:29.260- 03:31.980* :  Meanwhile Anthony Blinken is in the region.
*03:32.020- 03:34.400* :  He's going to be in Tel Aviv later on today.
*03:34.400- 03:39.600* :  I want to imagine he's going to be focusing as much on this as anything.
*03:41.800- 03:46.360* :  Exactly. We're talking about the threat and the risk of a conflict being sparked by
*03:46.360- 03:52.380* :  Hasbola's actions but in Israel some senior Israeli officials have been defending a larger
*03:52.380- 03:59.500* :  offensive against Hasbola to try to stop these attacks, to try to reduce the threat posed by
*03:59.780- 04:05.740* :  Hasbola which is this powerful Iranian-backed organization and also to allow the return of
*04:05.740- 04:11.000* :  thousands of residents who have been evacuated from communities in Northern Israel because of this
*04:11.000- 04:18.080* :  violence and yesterday the Israeli military chief of staff said that the Israeli army was ready
*04:18.080- 04:23.400* :  for another war so one of the messages from Anthony Blinken is that the violence needs
*04:23.400- 04:25.860* :  to be reduced to contain original conflict.
*04:25.860- 04:33.020* :  Hugo Bachega in Beirut. Now to an investigation by the BBC that's uncovered evidence of rape,
*04:33.060- 04:38.620* :  torture and forced abortions by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical
*04:38.620- 04:45.560* :  churches. TB Joshua was the late founder of the synagogue church of all nations in Nigeria
*04:46.000- 04:48.640* :  and built an evangelical empire that drew presidents,
*04:48.640- 04:52.400* :  Premier League footballers and millions of followers from across the globe.
*04:53.160- 04:57.660* :  Former church insiders have gone public now for the first time with claims of atrocities
*04:57.660- 05:00.980* :  that span almost 20 years. Peter Marimi reports.
*05:09.020- 05:12.200* :  TB Joshua was one of Africa's most famous pastors.
*05:12.940- 05:17.520* :  Drawing presidents, Premier League footballers and millions of followers across the globe.
*05:18.140- 05:25.140* :  He had huge resources, huge amounts of influence, not just in Nigeria,
*05:25.720- 05:29.000* :  through our Africa, Israel, Mexico, Singapore.
*05:32.420- 05:36.140* :  TB Joshua performed televised trainings where members of his congregation
*05:36.260- 05:40.560* :  claimed to have been cured of AIDS, cancer and a range of chronic conditions.
*05:41.100- 05:44.240* :  Negative states that for HIV and HIV2.
*05:45.300- 05:49.060* :  Everybody wanted the privilege to go with, to meet this
*05:50.580- 05:57.300* :  big giant. TB Joshua's closest followers were known as disciples and lived together for years
*05:57.300- 06:02.900* :  inside his compound in Nigeria. It was a psychological prison. We all thought we were in heaven,
*06:02.940- 06:07.000* :  but we were in hell and in hell terrible things happened.
*06:07.340- 06:10.840* :  Dozens of these insiders alleged that the pastor repeatedly assaulted,
*06:10.860- 06:17.000* :  ripped and tortured women behind closed doors with the most recent incidents in 2019.
*06:17.420- 06:26.060* :  It became so robotic, I disconnected from my body, I just became like a puppet.
*06:26.660- 06:34.100* :  Rape became like a normal terrifying thing that you would do just like you are
*06:35.100- 06:39.100* :  an animal being slaughtered. I was 17 years old.
*06:40.160- 06:43.740* :  You would be calling girls in one after the other.
*06:44.700- 06:49.460* :  I stayed there almost 14 years. There would be in thousands.
*06:50.840- 06:54.640* :  Some women claim they were first to have abortions inside his compound,
*06:54.640- 06:59.920* :  following their alleged assaults. I had three abortions at Synagogue
*07:01.520- 07:06.660* :  and from speaking to other women, I'm not the only one.
*07:07.840- 07:13.640* :  Women that he rapes, he forces them into abortion. I never had a choice
*07:14.640- 07:21.840* :  whether I could keep a potential child or not. People tried to speak up to expose him,
*07:22.420- 07:25.160* :  but nobody would listen.
*07:27.460- 07:31.920* :  TBJ has died in 2021. His wife Evelyn is now leading the synagogue
*07:31.920- 07:39.740* :  church of all nations. The BBC contacted the church with allegations in this report.
*07:40.740- 07:46.400* :  They did not respond to them, but they said previous claims against TBJ have been unfounded.
*07:47.340- 07:52.080* :  Today, the church still attracts millions of viewers to its online platforms.
*07:52.460- 08:00.540* :  Some people, they are still living in fear for their lives, in fear for the retribution that will
*08:00.540- 08:06.380* :  come if they do open their mouths. That report by Peter Murimi and you can watch
*08:06.380- 08:12.920* :  Disciples, the Cult of TB Joshua on the BBC Africa YouTube channel and listen to the new season
*08:12.920- 08:16.440* :  of World of Secrets, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*08:18.280- 08:23.020* :  On Friday, an Alaska Airlines flight had to make a dramatic emergency landing after part of
*08:23.020- 08:28.900* :  its fuselage detached mid-air. The missing part of the door section has now been found in Oregon.
*08:29.500- 08:33.080* :  Jennifer Hammendi, the National Transportation Board's safety chair,
*08:33.440- 08:38.340* :  said it had been located in the Cedar Hills suburb of the city, in the backyard of a teacher
*08:38.340- 08:42.640* :  called Bob. I'm excited to announce that we found the door plug.
*08:44.120- 08:51.580* :  Thank you, Bob. Bob, I will not give you Bob's last name, but Bob contacted us with two
*08:51.580- 09:01.420* :  photos of the door plug and said he found it in his backyard. Thank you, Bob. I will reach out to
*09:01.420- 09:06.800* :  you so that we so that I can thank you myself. Well, for more on the story, I spoke to our
*09:06.800- 09:12.060* :  transport expert Theo Leggett, asking him how significant this discovery is for investigators.
*09:12.980- 09:17.480* :  It's absolutely vital for the investigation because it is the part that detached from the plane.
*09:18.000- 09:24.120* :  Now, every 737-max-9 is built with two doors that are situated between the wings
*09:24.120- 09:29.500* :  and the rear of the aircraft. But these doors are only in use if the aircraft is configured to
*09:29.500- 09:34.440* :  have the maximum number of seats. Under those circumstances, you need two extra emergency exits
*09:34.880- 09:38.460* :  in order to meet safety regulations. In the case of the Alaska Airlines plane,
*09:38.460- 09:42.220* :  there were fewer seats. Therefore, these emergency exits weren't needed,
*09:42.720- 09:46.320* :  so they were basically fitted with a door that was non-functional. That's what they mean when
*09:46.320- 09:50.700* :  they refer to a door plug. And then the interior trim is placed over it, so the passengers don't
*09:50.700- 09:56.240* :  even know it's there. The problem with this aircraft is that for some reason that door became detached,
*09:56.240- 10:02.040* :  speculation surrounds the manufacture of that part and the way it was fitted, whether there was
*10:02.040- 10:06.440* :  a problem there, because this was a very new aircraft. But one way or another, it came off the
*10:06.440- 10:11.880* :  plane in flight. It was very lucky. It came off at a relatively low altitude, and when passengers
*10:11.880- 10:16.280* :  were still strapped into their seats, if it had come off higher up, it could have been much more
*10:16.280- 10:22.300* :  serious. So finding that door, being able to examine it, will be absolutely key to working out
*10:22.300- 10:26.380* :  what happened. Now, a number of airlines have grounded that particular Boeing model.
*10:26.840- 10:32.300* :  Meanwhile, we're hearing that pilots have reported pressurization warning lights just prior to
*10:32.300- 10:37.540* :  the incident. Do we know any more about that? Well, this was a pressurization warning light that
*10:37.540- 10:43.760* :  came on on this aircraft on at least three previous flights. The auto pressurization fail light comes
*10:43.760- 10:50.140* :  on when the pressure in the aircraft changes at an unacceptably fast rate. And it gives the
*10:50.140- 10:55.040* :  signal to the pilot that they can either go to manual pressurization because normally the pressure
*10:55.040- 10:59.300* :  in the aircraft is adjusted automatically, or if they're concerned to descend to a lower altitude
*10:59.300- 11:04.400* :  where the risks of depressurization are lower. Now, when a light like this comes on, it doesn't
*11:04.400- 11:09.260* :  automatically mean that there's a big failure going on. It can be a fault in the warning system,
*11:09.740- 11:14.580* :  but this was something that we know was already under investigation. And the plane had in fact
*11:14.580- 11:19.780* :  been placed on restricted duties, not allowed to fly over water, for example, while it was being
*11:19.780- 11:28.860* :  investigated. Theo-legged. And now, to Florida in the US. Five, four, three, we have ignition.
*11:29.980- 11:34.860* :  And that is the moment the Vulcan rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, marking the first
*11:34.860- 11:41.080* :  US moon landing attempt in more than half a century. The so-called Peregrine mission is set to land
*11:41.080- 11:47.000* :  on the moon on the 23rd of February and will seek to gather data about the lunar surface ahead
*11:47.000- 11:52.260* :  of planned future human missions. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos told us more about the
*11:52.260- 11:59.100* :  project. Well, it's an important day on many fronts. The rocket that took this lander into space
*11:59.100- 12:05.640* :  and put it on a path towards the moon is a brand new all-American rocket, the Vulcan, operated by
*12:05.640- 12:10.560* :  United Launch Alliance. You may not have heard of them, but they've been responsible for many
*12:10.560- 12:16.200* :  national security mission launches by satellites, military telecommunications, but also NASA missions
*12:16.200- 12:22.340* :  in the past. The rovers on Mars were launched by this company. And so this is their first go with
*12:22.340- 12:27.180* :  their new rockets. It's a very important that it worked out of the box and it did. And so now we
*12:27.180- 12:34.040* :  have this Peregrine lander heading towards the moon. It has NASA instruments on it, but it is not a
*12:34.040- 12:40.540* :  NASA mission. It has been contracted by NASA. So the company owns the lander that built a lander
*12:40.540- 12:46.440* :  that will operate the lander, astrobotic of Pittsburgh. They're in charge. NASA has, as I say,
*12:46.440- 12:51.600* :  contracted them purchase payload space and they are being carried. NASA has been carried to the moon.
*12:51.780- 12:58.240* :  So we've left the Apollo era 50 years ago where entering the Peregrine era are we? And this is
*12:58.240- 13:04.100* :  potentially going to be the four runner for manned missions to the moon in the future.
*13:04.340- 13:09.520* :  Yeah, absolutely. So there is this program called Artemis, which NASA now has. You remember a
*13:09.520- 13:15.320* :  Apollo, Artemis, or it's all your mythology, where they get these names from, isn't it? So Artemis is
*13:15.320- 13:20.820* :  the the astronaut program that they have, but they want to establish a permanent presence on the moon.
*13:21.180- 13:26.680* :  The last Apollo missions, I think the last one Apollo 17 that softland, it was after three days,
*13:26.680- 13:32.120* :  then they came home. The idea is that we go and we stay. And if you do that, then obviously you
*13:32.120- 13:37.400* :  will need t-shirts, toothbrushes, toothpaste and all that kind of stuff. And it will be robotic
*13:37.400- 13:43.700* :  missions by private companies that will sell that transportation, that logistics service to NASA.
*13:44.100- 13:48.780* :  And you mentioned it in an online article you were writing, this is just the first of a number
*13:48.780- 13:55.580* :  of planned landings on the moon, a stampede of landings. It's called this year. Not just by NASA.
*13:55.580- 14:02.100* :  Oh, we got Japan. It's going to attempt landing in the next few weeks. We've also got China,
*14:02.680- 14:07.560* :  which is going to try and retrieve rocks from the far side of the moon. India, obviously,
*14:07.900- 14:12.480* :  touched down last year at the South Pole. I mean, it just gets more and more exciting at the moon.
*14:12.480- 14:14.900* :  It's the place to be. Jonathan Amos.
*14:18.320- 14:21.720* :  Coming up in this podcast, Hollywood's award season kicks off.
*14:22.460- 14:25.700* :  Live from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California,
*14:25.700- 14:31.240* :  it's the 81st Golden Globes. We hear about the big winners of the night.
*14:37.220- 14:41.940* :  A web of manipulation and terrifying abuse. If you'd have said to do anything,
*14:41.940- 14:45.260* :  I would have done it. With a powerful religious figure at its centre.
*14:45.540- 14:48.580* :  There was no safe place. You don't say no to him.
*14:49.200- 14:54.000* :  World of Secrets from the BBC World Service is back with a brand new season,
*14:54.380- 14:57.620* :  investigating allegations surrounding the preacher, TB Joshua.
*14:57.780- 15:01.420* :  The culture of secrecy needs to be broken.
*15:01.800- 15:05.060* :  Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*15:11.280- 15:16.700* :  India's top court has cancelled an order that allowed for the early release of 11 men who
*15:16.700- 15:22.320* :  were convicted of the gang rape of a pregnant woman. The incident happened during the 2002
*15:22.320- 15:29.020* :  anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state. Our South Asia correspondent Yogi Telemai gave me the
*15:29.020- 15:34.580* :  reaction to the court's decision. So we've heard from the lawyer for Ms. Bilky Spano,
*15:34.580- 15:38.940* :  who has said that this is a huge victory. This is a victory for women.
*15:38.940- 15:44.460* :  You know, this move had prompted outrage in the country because not only were these men prematurely
*15:44.460- 15:51.040* :  released. They were, they've been in jail for gang-raping Bilky Spano, but also on charges of murder.
*15:51.820- 15:56.340* :  14 of Ms. Banu's family members were murdered during this attack.
*15:57.560- 16:02.900* :  And after they were released, they almost got a hero's welcome. There were family members who
*16:02.900- 16:08.720* :  gave them sweets, who touched their feet, you know, almost as a mark of respect. They were
*16:09.180- 16:14.080* :  these men were part of a Hindu mob that attacked Ms. Banu, who was a Muslim woman and her family
*16:14.580- 16:20.780* :  during the religious riots in Gujarat in 2002. So there had been shock. Ms. Banu had said she
*16:20.780- 16:26.680* :  felt completely numb. She'd felt completely let down and had lost faith in justice, you know,
*16:26.680- 16:31.780* :  and the justice system in India. We are yet to hear from her. We do know that in the village
*16:31.780- 16:37.120* :  where she resides. Family members are saying that they're extremely relieved that they are
*16:37.120- 16:41.160* :  celebrating at this outcome, but we are yet to hear from Ms. Banu herself.
*16:41.480- 16:46.360* :  And Yogi, the fact that, as you said, that these people weren't there, that their release was
*16:46.360- 16:50.080* :  announced, which has now been overturned, but the fact that when it was announced that they were
*16:50.080- 16:55.940* :  going to get a hero's welcome suggests that this is very much an unhealed wound within Indian
*16:55.940- 17:00.440* :  society. You know, and many would say it's a wound that's becoming deeper and deeper. We have
*17:01.260- 17:07.500* :  seen a much deeper religious polarization in India. You know, the government of Gujarat is run
*17:07.500- 17:13.100* :  by the BJP party, which is also the one that runs the federal government. It's Prime Minister Narendra
*17:13.100- 17:18.620* :  Modi's BJP party. He was actually the chief minister in Gujarat during the religious violence and
*17:18.620- 17:24.420* :  was accused of not doing enough to protect the lives of Muslims. More than 1,000 people were killed
*17:24.420- 17:29.480* :  during that violence, most of them from the Muslim community. That was Yogi Te Limai.
*17:30.840- 17:35.580* :  In the United States, congressional leaders have reached a deal over the total amount of
*17:35.580- 17:40.960* :  federal spending for the rest of 2024, as they seek to avoid a partial government shutdown.
*17:41.680- 17:48.160* :  The $1.6 trillion figure includes almost $900 billion for defense and greater protection
*17:48.160- 17:54.260* :  from cuts to benefits and health. A provision demanded by Democrats at the agreement now needs
*17:54.260- 18:00.480* :  to be approved by both houses of Congress. So how significant is this negotiation? Our reporter
*18:00.480- 18:06.600* :  Will Vernon is in the US. I think the deal is significant. There was a lot of nervousness here
*18:07.020- 18:11.280* :  in Washington over that looming, spending deadline of the 19th of January. That is the date
*18:11.280- 18:16.620* :  when part of the government funding that was agreed last year in Congress is due to run out.
*18:17.100- 18:22.660* :  And the hope is that this deal will form the basis for an agreement to avert that shutdown.
*18:22.660- 18:27.700* :  In a statement, President Biden welcomed the news of this deal, saying it moved the country
*18:27.700- 18:33.420* :  one step closer to preventing a needless government shutdown. And I think that's key this phrase,
*18:33.420- 18:39.340* :  he used one step closer, meaning we're not quite there yet. Remember that Congress is now
*18:39.340- 18:45.380* :  more polarized than it's been for many, many years, and reaching any kind of bipartisan agreement
*18:45.380- 18:50.400* :  now is incredibly difficult. So I think it will be seen as an achievement for sure,
*18:50.400- 18:55.280* :  but the spending arrangement is not a poem and dry yet. This is what was called a top-line
*18:55.280- 19:02.840* :  agreement. So there's $886 billion for defense and $704 billion for non-defense spending.
*19:02.840- 19:06.820* :  But that means that congressional leaders have basically decided the numbers,
*19:06.820- 19:11.380* :  the kind of top-line, the big numbers, but details still have to be kind of hammered out
*19:11.540- 19:15.240* :  and legislation still needs to be passed to get this through to get this over the line.
*19:15.940- 19:22.620* :  Well done. Now to a remarkable story of endurance, a survivor of the Holocaust who started a
*19:22.620- 19:29.680* :  band and tore the world calling for peace. Saul Dryer was born in Poland in 1925 and was a
*19:29.680- 19:35.480* :  normal ordinary child until the Nazis arrived. After years spent in the Jewish ghettos,
*19:35.880- 19:40.700* :  then surviving concentration camps, he was liberated by the US Army at the end of the Second World
*19:41.020- 19:46.680* :  War. Now, 98 years old, he travels the world with his band, delivering a message of peace.
*19:47.320- 19:51.960* :  Davina Gupta spoke to Saul Dryer and started by asking him how he survived the Holocaust.
*19:53.020- 19:59.820* :  I survived the Holocaust in three concentration camps. When I started when I was 16,
*19:59.820- 20:07.740* :  I finished when I was 19 in our health. I was in crackle plash over the city where I was born.
*20:08.500- 20:14.020* :  From then, I went to Schindler's factory, but I didn't work in Schindler's factory. I was
*20:14.020- 20:20.240* :  an effective next to it, but we won the same concentration camp. From then, the liquidated everything
*20:20.240- 20:28.160* :  and Schindler took his people separate and we went to Mathausen, Austria. I was in Mathausen
*20:28.160- 20:34.520* :  several weeks until they gave me details and sent me to a concentration camp in Lins.
*20:34.600- 20:40.980* :  I was working in a factory as a welder. In Lins, I was liberated by the American Army.
*20:41.680- 20:45.020* :  And Oscar Schindler was, of course, the German businessman who employed Jews.
*20:45.140- 20:51.840* :  And at that time, you learned to play drums and music helped people survive.
*20:51.840- 20:57.920* :  No, no. At that time, I learned only how to play the spoons with a beat. I learned the drums
*20:57.920- 21:06.560* :  after the war when I went to Italy in a displaced person camp. We had a English commander
*21:07.580- 21:14.040* :  who was running the camp in Hebrew da Piano with a set of drums. I had the head right away
*21:14.040- 21:19.760* :  volunteers for the piano. I volunteered to play the drums and I learned how to play the drums
*21:19.760- 21:26.060* :  in Italy. It came to the United States and the United States never touched the drums until
*21:26.060- 21:32.560* :  I was 89 years old. Could I take you back to the concentration camp when you were there?
*21:33.400- 21:39.300* :  How did music help you then? Every night we came from work. We didn't have no food.
*21:39.900- 21:47.580* :  We were very tired so we had a singer who is singing in Jewish synagogue and he started to
*21:47.580- 21:54.820* :  singing and the friends, I mean the prisoners helped him to sing and I had two spoons and I
*21:54.820- 22:00.120* :  thought that something is missing so I was laying on my bed in the start and I was clapping
*22:00.120- 22:05.120* :  this spoon like that and I got to show it to you right now. I see two spoons, I put together.
*22:12.700- 22:18.240* :  That is really beautiful. Later in life, you picked up music, tell us about it and you started
*22:18.240- 22:24.340* :  playing drums for a cause. Yes, ma'am. I started playing drums when I came to the United States.
*22:24.380- 22:32.600* :  I didn't touch the drum for sixty-some years where eventually a woman, she was 100-some years
*22:32.600- 22:39.180* :  all the best away and she was a pianist and she survived. She survived the rest of the
*22:40.360- 22:46.660* :  propaganda concentration camp also in Czechoslovakia and I felt very bad about it. There were
*22:46.660- 22:53.720* :  350 million people in the United States. I came with the idea to put together a Holocaust
*22:53.720- 23:00.920* :  survival event and I woke up my wife. I told her she told me I'm crazy. I went to my clergy.
*23:00.920- 23:06.820* :  I tell them the same story. He told me while I'm crazy but the following morning I took a check
*23:06.820- 23:12.560* :  and went and back I said, I bought a set of drums. Today I played the drums and I opened,
*23:12.840- 23:19.700* :  we opened, me in Justina, opened a foundation under my name, South Generation Foundation and
*23:19.700- 23:26.560* :  we don't very well because we want to play for peace in the world. Holocaust Survivor Soul Dryer.
*23:27.920- 23:34.420* :  In Los Angeles, Christopher Nolan's blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer dominated the Golden Globes
*23:34.760- 23:40.160* :  winning five awards. Barbie was expected to win the top prizes in the musical and comedy
*23:40.160- 23:46.520* :  category but in the end it won the inaugural box office achievement award after grossing 1.4
*23:46.520- 23:52.240* :  billion dollars worldwide. The BBC's Emma Vardy was at the Golden Globes and sent this report.
*24:00.500- 24:06.140* :  Awards are an important part of the film and television economy and there was a sense that many in
*24:06.140- 24:11.280* :  Hollywood were keen to get back to the business of promoting their work. It was the first major
*24:11.280- 24:16.700* :  awards after months of actors and writers strikes saw productions halted in red carpet events
*24:16.700- 24:24.780* :  cancelled. But now the colour was back and with her signature pink adorning the red carpet,
*24:25.280- 24:30.700* :  the Barbie influence was clear to see. And the Golden Globes goes to Barbie.
*24:31.300- 24:37.880* :  The film won the new Golden Globes category box office achievement, celebrating productions
*24:37.900- 24:44.700* :  that were a big hit at the cinema. Thank you we would like to dedicate this to every single person
*24:44.700- 24:50.800* :  on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on earth, the movie theaters.
*24:52.040- 24:55.040* :  But the night really belonged to Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer!
*24:55.500- 25:02.020* :  There's three hour epic about the American physicist who developed the atomic bomb was released
*25:02.020- 25:07.460* :  on the same day as Barbie that couldn't have been more different. It won five Golden Globes,
*25:07.460- 25:12.780* :  including Best Picture, Best Director and there was a missed timed kiss for Oppenheimer's star
*25:12.780- 25:15.940* :  Killian Murphy as he accepted Best Actor in a drama.
*25:24.960- 25:31.160* :  In the TV categories, the big winners were beef, the bear and succession with acting wins for Sarah
*25:31.160- 25:38.600* :  Snook, Kiran Kolkin and Matthew McFadden. I just adored every second playing the
*25:38.600- 25:45.680* :  weird and wonderful human greased stain that is Tom Wandsland. There was an emotional speech
*25:45.680- 25:51.540* :  by Lily Gladstone, picking up Best Actress for Killers of the Flower Moon, the first Native American
*25:51.540- 25:58.060* :  actress to win a Golden Globe. This is for every little res kid, every little Irving kid,
*25:58.060- 26:02.400* :  every little native kid out there who has a dream, who is seeing themselves represented
*26:02.400- 26:10.660* :  and our stories told by ourselves in our own words with tremendous allies and tremendous trust
*26:11.340- 26:16.340* :  from with and from each other. So thank you all so much.
*26:20.960- 26:26.920* :  The red comp is a melee of activity. There's fans screaming trying to get the stars attention,
*26:27.000- 26:32.740* :  journalists lined up trying to get interviews and all the while these mini bottles of champagne
*26:32.740- 26:39.500* :  being handed out to get people in the mood to party. It's all got a feel-good factor about it
*26:39.680- 26:44.860* :  and that's quite different to just a few months back when there was an actors and writers strike on
*26:44.860- 26:52.660* :  quite a lot of animosity. Hollywood is back! With the rather more formal Oscars approaching in two
*26:52.660- 26:57.700* :  months' time, critics will be looking to see if Oppenheimer will be toasting the same success.
*27:00.340- 27:06.160* :  Now, it is an often you consider yourself fortunate to have a mouse meddling in your shed,
*27:06.800- 27:12.800* :  but for Rodney Holbrook in Wales in the UK, the rodent is a welcome guest. Over the weekend,
*27:12.800- 27:19.000* :  a video went viral on social media of a mouse cleaning up Rodney's shed, the former postman,
*27:19.000- 27:25.880* :  has even named it the Welsh tidy mouse. Sarah Montague asked how he first discovered his little helper.
*27:26.620- 27:32.260* :  Well, the first sign was in the box I got where I got some peanuts in for feeding the birds outside
*27:32.260- 27:37.920* :  in the garden. I went in one morning early October and the nuts it was in there was gone and I
*27:37.920- 27:43.900* :  thought, well, I haven't eaten that nuts. So the next morning I put more in and they was gone again.
*27:43.900- 27:50.580* :  So I thought there's some extreme going on here. So I put the nuts back in and the next morning,
*27:50.620- 27:56.280* :  I had bits and pieces put on top of the nuts. I thought I got to set a light camera up here.
*27:56.280- 28:01.500* :  So I set it up on a tripod in my shed and low and build. There's the videos I got.
*28:01.800- 28:07.960* :  What seems phenomenal about it is, well, how many pieces this mouse is picking up and putting in?
*28:08.080- 28:12.220* :  Yeah. Well, it's what it looks like, it looks almost like a dish. Did you deliberately put more
*28:12.220- 28:17.500* :  things out for it to tidy up? I added a couple of things, but not much really because I want
*28:17.500- 28:24.120* :  it to be as natural as possible. But it goes to quite a lot of effort to pick things up and it does
*28:24.120- 28:30.340* :  look like it's tidying. It does. That's why I call it tidying mouse. But you're going to ask me why
*28:30.340- 28:36.620* :  I reckon it does it? Of course I am. Why do you reckon? I think it's just covering the nuts up to
*28:36.800- 28:44.120* :  hide them away from any other mouse that might venture past. This is mine nuts. You're not
*28:44.120- 28:49.220* :  having them. So it's hiding them. The other thing I could think is doing is just enjoying
*28:49.220- 28:52.500* :  yourself. I'm a bit of fun every night, but I can't imagine that.
*28:52.700- 28:56.800* :  We've got to be clear what size. I mean, this is, we're talking a very small mouse. How big
*28:56.800- 29:02.360* :  are the things it's picking up? There was one. It picked up a long, I must have had a stick of
*29:02.360- 29:09.740* :  some sort out there. You see it on the video, I think. It's a long stick, which is about six times
*29:09.740- 29:14.420* :  the length of it. I just wondered, given you've got this mouse to do that clearing up after you,
*29:14.440- 29:24.020* :  has it stopped you tidying up? Yeah. Rodney Holbrook there. You can see a video of the mouse
*29:24.260- 29:27.780* :  allegedly tidying up on our BBC News website.
*29:30.900- 29:34.520* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*29:34.520- 29:39.700* :  later on. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an
