*00:55.940- 01:00.160* :  This time around, the stories are all about the battlefronts that engulfed us during
*01:00.380- 01:00.820* :  lockdown.
*01:00.820- 01:07.440* :  The story's twisted turn until each one ends with the explosion of a new far-reaching
*01:07.680- 01:08.460* :  cultural war.
*01:08.500- 01:11.040* :  If you tell me, am I there if you had superhuman strength?

*01:22.140- 01:25.700* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:28.380- 01:34.100* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 16th of January, these are our
*01:34.100- 01:34.840* :  main stories.
*01:35.420- 01:40.740* :  A large US-owned container ship is hit by a houthi missile off the coast of Yemen as
*01:40.740- 01:42.680* :  Britain defends Western air strikes.
*01:43.140- 01:48.180* :  Those strikes that we conducted have been successful in the specific targets that were selected.
*01:48.820- 01:50.840* :  Israel rejects Hamas's claims.
*01:50.840- 01:55.520* :  One of its air strikes killed two hostages shown dead in a video released by the group
*01:55.980- 02:01.160* :  and a warning about the growing gap between Rich and Poor as a world first is predicted
*02:01.940- 02:02.760* :  the trillionaire.
*02:03.140- 02:06.300* :  Nobody should have a billion dollars, let alone a trillion dollars.
*02:06.300- 02:09.580* :  This is not the kind of economy that we need to overcome poverty.
*02:12.220- 02:19.380* :  So in this podcast, the case of the Italian culture minister and the Stolen 17th Century
*02:19.380- 02:23.800* :  painting, and one of the world's best known video game franchises is back.
*02:29.700- 02:32.200* :  A culturally sensitive Prince of Persia.
*02:35.960- 02:40.520* :  Houthi rebels in Yemen have confirmed that they carried out a ballistic missile strike
*02:40.520- 02:42.040* :  on a US container ship.
*02:42.320- 02:48.100* :  The Gibraltar Eagle reported no injuries or significant damage and continued its journey.
*02:48.100- 02:52.680* :  The attack by the houthis follows last week's US-led air strikes against them.
*02:52.680- 02:59.000* :  The Iranian-backed group has been attacking ships since November in protest at Israel's
*02:59.000- 02:59.840* :  war with Hamas.
*03:00.280- 03:05.520* :  Addressing the British Parliament about the US and UK mission, the Prime Minister Rishisunak
*03:05.820- 03:08.960* :  told MPs the government was backing words with action.
*03:09.500- 03:14.540* :  Those strikes that we conducted have been successful in the specific targets that were selected
*03:15.020- 03:15.820* :  during the strikes.
*03:15.820- 03:19.840* :  Obviously, that's an initial assessment, but that remains our case at the moment.
*03:20.440- 03:26.240* :  And more generally, what we want to see is a reduction of tensions in the region and
*03:26.240- 03:27.880* :  a restoration of stability.
*03:28.340- 03:33.660* :  Attacks by Houthi rebels in protest at the war in Gaza on commercial vessels have resulted
*03:33.660- 03:37.800* :  in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
*03:38.280- 03:42.900* :  For an update on the attack, I spoke to our correspondent Hugo Beshege, who's covering
*03:42.900- 03:44.140* :  the story from Beirut.
*03:44.580- 03:49.500* :  Alex, the US military should a statement saying that this commercial vessel was hit by
*03:49.500- 03:52.300* :  an anti-ship ballistic missile.
*03:52.460- 03:57.820* :  There was no significant damage and the ship now is continuing its journey.
*03:58.000- 04:03.020* :  The US military said this happened just hours after another anti-ship ballistic missile
*04:03.020- 04:04.600* :  was fired by the Houthis.
*04:05.020- 04:10.560* :  This missile landed in an area inside Yemen, so it didn't hit any vessel.
*04:10.600- 04:16.820* :  But I think this shows that the Houthis continue to have the ability to fire and hit vessels
*04:17.180- 04:17.940* :  in the Red Sea.
*04:18.060- 04:23.900* :  So this shows that the Houthis continue to pose a significant threat to vessels in the
*04:23.900- 04:24.280* :  Red Sea.
*04:24.620- 04:28.920* :  So what do we know about those strikes that were carried out by the US and the UK?
*04:28.920- 04:30.820* :  Have we any more detail on what they achieved?
*04:31.240- 04:38.420* :  We're talking about dozens of strikes, 60 targets hit nearly 30 locations in Yemen.
*04:38.860- 04:43.180* :  US officials, officials in Britain have been saying the attacks have been successful.
*04:43.680- 04:49.600* :  And they say that these attacks were to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.
*04:49.600- 04:52.880* :  We heard from Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, who addressed Parliament.
*04:52.880- 04:53.960* :  He made this point.
*04:54.700- 05:00.620* :  And as you said in the introduction, these attacks have caused major disruption to global
*05:00.620- 05:06.400* :  trade because the Red Sea has been effectively closed, ships are having to go through the
*05:06.400- 05:12.840* :  Cape of Good Hope in Africa, adding costs to the journeys, 10 extra days to those journeys.
*05:13.500- 05:17.560* :  And there have been concerns about the economic impact of those attacks.
*05:17.560- 05:23.160* :  So the Americans in the British defending those attacks as trying to prevent an escalation
*05:23.160- 05:24.120* :  in the region.
*05:24.120- 05:30.100* :  But what the Houthis are saying is that these attacks are an escalation on Israel's behalf,
*05:30.140- 05:35.900* :  as they say that they've been carrying out these attacks to protest against Israel's war
*05:35.900- 05:37.760* :  against Hamas in Gaza.
*05:38.040- 05:43.220* :  And they say that these attacks are going to continue unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza.
*05:43.620- 05:44.400* :  Who go beshege?
*05:45.060- 05:49.680* :  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, has been looking at what options are now open
*05:49.680- 05:53.780* :  to the Houthis and how they could keep targeting shipping in the Red Sea.
*05:54.200- 05:59.080* :  The Houthis, who control most of the populated parts of Yemen, now have three options.
*05:59.640- 06:04.260* :  They can choose to back down, having made their point about supporting Hamas, raise their
*06:04.260- 06:07.220* :  regional profile, and increase their popularity at home.
*06:07.920- 06:11.720* :  Their actions to date show no sign of them doing this, in fact quite the opposite.
*06:12.400- 06:17.020* :  They can continue to harass military and commercial shipping off their coast, firing off the
*06:17.060- 06:17.840* :  occasional missile.
*06:18.340- 06:22.380* :  This is what they appear to be doing now, with recent attacks aimed at vessels off the
*06:22.380- 06:24.780* :  coastal cities of Haudeda and Aden.
*06:25.740- 06:28.260* :  And this is the option the West should worry about.
*06:28.880- 06:33.220* :  They could marshal their remaining missiles and drones and wait for the opportunity to
*06:33.220- 06:38.800* :  launch a mass attack on a US or British warship, in the hopes of overwhelming its air defenses.
*06:39.520- 06:43.820* :  This is something the Houthis spokesman has already hinted at, and it remains a real risk.
*06:44.600- 06:49.080* :  US intelligence assesses that the recent airstrikes on the Houthis military facilities
*06:49.620- 06:53.740* :  have destroyed or seriously degraded, at least a quarter of their missile arsenal.
*06:54.440- 06:56.080* :  Further airstrikes will degrade that.
*06:56.820- 07:01.440* :  So the Houthis, possibly in consultation with their Iranian backers, will need to make
*07:01.440- 07:06.700* :  some careful calculations as to how far they take this beyond their far-right rhetoric
*07:06.720- 07:07.740* :  about retaliation.
*07:08.360- 07:09.280* :  Frank Gardner.
*07:10.100- 07:15.200* :  Hamas has released a new video which claims to show the bodies of two dead Israeli hostages.
*07:15.620- 07:20.060* :  Hamas blamed Israeli airstrikes for their deaths, a claim which is impossible to verify.
*07:20.060- 07:23.460* :  Our correspondent, Injusulam, we're a Davis, tell me more.
*07:23.880- 07:29.300* :  Ever since this crisis began and one feature of it was that more than 200 Israelis and
*07:29.300- 07:33.520* :  other nationalities were taken hostage by Hamas to Gaza, was that they released videos
*07:34.180- 07:37.120* :  initially as a proof of life to show that they were still alive.
*07:37.540- 07:40.960* :  The tactic has always been when they produced these videos to try and persuade the Israelis
*07:40.960- 07:45.240* :  to call a cease fire, because that, according to Hamas, is the only way to guarantee the
*07:45.240- 07:46.160* :  safety of the hostages.
*07:46.640- 07:51.260* :  But this video has been particularly sinister to say the Israelis and a very difficult one
*07:51.260- 07:54.120* :  for the families of the hostages, because it was released in three tranches.
*07:54.520- 07:58.440* :  The first one about 24 hours ago just showed three hostages speaking to camera.
*07:59.020- 08:00.580* :  We couldn't tell when it was taken.
*08:01.100- 08:06.620* :  A second video released this morning showed the three hostages again, but suggested that
*08:06.820- 08:11.200* :  they may be dead, and it invited people to wait till tonight to find out.
*08:11.660- 08:16.880* :  And tonight, a third video has been released showing the bodies of two male hostages.
*08:17.340- 08:21.480* :  And the third hostage, a female, is reading out a statement, and you can see clearly that
*08:21.540- 08:22.480* :  she's reading out a statement.
*08:22.480- 08:26.860* :  These videos are filmed under duress, saying that they were killed in Israeli air strikes.
*08:26.880- 08:32.560* :  So the message is clear from Hamas, if not brutal, saying that Israel must stop its campaign
*08:32.560- 08:35.840* :  against Hamas targets in Gaza for the hostages to be released safely.
*08:35.900- 08:41.080* :  And I think it will certainly increase public pressure in Israel, which sees the release
*08:41.080- 08:45.000* :  of the hostages as an absolute priority over and above the military objective.
*08:45.140- 08:49.140* :  Yeah, I'm just seeing on the Reuters wire of an Israeli military spokesperson saying
*08:49.140- 08:54.740* :  the hostage purported dead in the Hamas video was not killed by Israeli fire.
*08:54.740- 08:57.620* :  Have you heard anything else that the Israelis are saying about this?
*08:58.040- 09:00.420* :  No, it's impossible to say how the hostages were killed.
*09:00.420- 09:03.320* :  Hamas claimed that they were killed in an air strike, simply cannot be verified.
*09:03.320- 09:08.320* :  And certainly Israel would hold Hamas responsible for the safety and welfare of the hostages,
*09:08.720- 09:10.580* :  whatever conditions they're being held in.
*09:11.060- 09:16.120* :  But of course this comes in a wider context, you know, another 150 people were killed
*09:16.120- 09:21.680* :  in Gaza today in Israeli air strikes, say the Hamasra and Health Ministry, and bringing
*09:21.680- 09:24.220* :  a number of dead in Gaza to 24,000.
*09:24.720- 09:27.320* :  So this is war that's affecting many people on all sides.
*09:28.080- 09:28.740* :  We're at Davis.
*09:29.400- 09:33.940* :  Staying with the conflict and the events leading up to the October 7th attacks on Israel,
*09:34.460- 09:39.520* :  a unit of young female Israeli soldiers stationed on the border with Gaza to look for signs
*09:39.520- 09:44.880* :  of anything suspicious had warned of a major assault, but they were unheard as the BBC's
*09:44.880- 09:47.920* :  Alice Cuddy explained to look way sir Burak.
*09:48.560- 09:53.440* :  We've been looking specifically at these units of young female officers that are based
*09:53.580- 09:55.320* :  very close to the Gaza border.
*09:55.620- 10:01.160* :  Their job is basically to watch hours of live surveillance footage looking out for anything
*10:01.160- 10:03.040* :  that they think is suspicious.
*10:03.680- 10:06.400* :  They're known in Israel as the eyes of the state.
*10:06.600- 10:10.940* :  In the run up to October 7th, a number of them have told us that they did begin to
*10:10.940- 10:15.980* :  see things that were giving them reason to have suspicions, but they say that these warnings
*10:15.980- 10:17.080* :  were not being heard.
*10:17.640- 10:18.880* :  So what did they observe?
*10:19.240- 10:24.300* :  Training by Hamas, they saw them building within Gaza and model Israeli tanks, that they
*10:24.300- 10:26.020* :  would then practice how to take over.
*10:26.680- 10:28.800* :  They were also practicing raids and kidnapping.
*10:28.800- 10:33.100* :  Separately, they were saying people were planting bombs near the fence, which they believe
*10:33.100- 10:34.580* :  was to test its strengths.
*10:34.680- 10:40.500* :  One young soldier, Ronnie, told us that she saw vans of Hamas fighters who were passing
*10:40.500- 10:46.300* :  watch posts on the other side of the fence, carefully inspecting it, taking photos, they
*10:46.300- 10:50.540* :  saw an increase in what they describe as an attempted border incursion.
*10:50.680- 10:55.840* :  Also, they say they saw what they're describing as suspicious behaviour from farmers and bird
*10:55.840- 10:57.940* :  catches on the other side of the fence.
*10:58.300- 11:03.280* :  They were moving closer, these people's faces were changing, and they believed that they
*11:03.280- 11:05.820* :  were collecting intelligence ahead of the attacks.
*11:06.640- 11:09.880* :  What's the significance of the IDF using women in this role?
*11:10.100- 11:15.260* :  Women have always done this role, they've always been in this unit, it's young women because
*11:15.260- 11:20.100* :  of conscription in Israel, so they tend to be in their late teens to early 20s.
*11:20.500- 11:25.640* :  Some people have speculated that part of the reason these women were not listened to
*11:25.840- 11:28.740* :  is linked to chauvinism in the IDF.
*11:29.180- 11:32.240* :  None of the women that we spoke to were really making that allegation.
*11:32.280- 11:36.460* :  They said that the reason that they believed they were not listened to is because they're
*11:36.460- 11:38.160* :  at the bottom of the rung in the military.
*11:38.160- 11:41.560* :  One of them said, we're seen as artists, we're not seen as soldiers.
*11:42.080- 11:47.760* :  This activity was first noticed back in May, emails were then sent, believe around July
*11:47.760- 11:52.720* :  time, their managers, their bosses, how did they respond to their reports?
*11:53.160- 11:57.900* :  A number of them were saying, Hamas is always preparing for an attack, but what they noticed
*11:57.900- 12:03.920* :  in the run-up to October 7 was an increase in activity and an escalation also in the
*12:03.920- 12:09.120* :  kinds of activity that they were saying, now they report suspicious activity to their
*12:09.120- 12:14.400* :  direct commander and also they can log it in a computer system on the base, where the
*12:14.400- 12:19.820* :  idea is that it is then passed up to more senior elements of the military and to intelligence
*12:20.480- 12:21.680* :  who can then assess it.
*12:21.880- 12:26.280* :  They say they didn't receive responses to the reports that they don't know what was
*12:26.280- 12:31.160* :  done with them and most of the people we spoke to say they felt that it was being taken
*12:31.160- 12:32.920* :  seriously within their base.
*12:33.240- 12:36.960* :  They basically say that almost no response was fed back down to them.
*12:37.460- 12:39.640* :  They were never told anything that was going on.
*12:39.640- 12:44.460* :  These young women were not privy to broader intelligence that the military may have had
*12:44.460- 12:47.520* :  access to, beyond filing the reports.
*12:48.060- 12:52.320* :  They have very little idea of what happened beyond that and that's one of the questions
*12:52.320- 12:57.080* :  that the surviving officers and that the families of those who were killed are now asking.
*12:57.660- 13:01.200* :  Some did pass away and some were taking hostage as well.
*13:01.740- 13:08.460* :  When you spoke to these officers, what were their reflections on realising that their warnings
*13:08.460- 13:10.060* :  had very much come true?
*13:10.400- 13:14.600* :  One woman, she was telling us she was not at the base on the morning of the attacks
*13:14.600- 13:19.640* :  but she woke up to WhatsApp messages from a group that she shared with other officers
*13:20.360- 13:24.360* :  and she said that the feeling that ran through her was this is the thing that we've long
*13:24.400- 13:26.140* :  feared is now happening.
*13:26.140- 13:31.420* :  There's lots of questions among the people that we've been speaking to about why their
*13:31.420- 13:36.720* :  warnings they feel they won't listen to and also some anger from the families in surviving
*13:36.720- 13:37.240* :  soldiers.
*13:38.360- 13:43.120* :  The more than a dozen of these surveillance soldiers were killed on October 7th and,
*13:43.160- 13:47.680* :  as you say, others were taken hostage and several remain within Gaza.
*13:48.460- 13:53.380* :  Several of these women said they were telling their families about their concerns in the
*13:53.380- 13:55.040* :  run-up to October 7th.
*13:55.380- 14:01.980* :  Alice Cuddy, now to a stark warning about artificial intelligence, a new report by the International
*14:01.980- 14:07.300* :  Monetary Fund says that the technology will affect nearly 40% of all jobs across the
*14:07.300- 14:11.660* :  world and that figure rises to 60% in the advanced economies.
*14:11.660- 14:17.900* :  My colleague James Coppnault spoke to the BBC's business correspondent, Zhu Hao-de-Selva in Singapore.
*14:18.500- 14:22.880* :  The most interesting point in this analysis is really a warning about the potential for
*14:22.920- 14:29.020* :  AI to increase inequality across the board, whether it's between advanced and low-income
*14:29.020- 14:32.740* :  countries, between young and old, skilled or low-skilled workers.
*14:32.740- 14:36.060* :  The report says AI could widen the gap.
*14:36.060- 14:41.860* :  It says the impact will be felt more dramatically in the advanced economies where it says about
*14:41.860- 14:44.060* :  60% of jobs will be affected.
*14:44.520- 14:48.720* :  60 workers in those countries will benefit from the technology, which will enhance their
*14:49.400- 14:50.440* :  productivity and also their pay.
*14:50.800- 14:53.800* :  But for many others, the impact will be far from positive.
*14:53.800- 14:59.300* :  AI will be able to replace some jobs that are currently executed by humans, and in that
*14:59.300- 15:03.480* :  way it will lower demand for those jobs and lower pay for those jobs as well.
*15:03.860- 15:08.920* :  The report also talks about the generational gap with higher income and younger workers
*15:08.920- 15:14.460* :  at a benefiting disproportionately from the adoption of AI, while lower income and older
*15:14.460- 15:16.060* :  workers could flow behind.
*15:16.820- 15:20.500* :  Yeah, and what sort of steps have been taken right now, then, to mitigate those negative
*15:20.500- 15:20.860* :  impact?
*15:21.340- 15:25.940* :  Well, this is a highly disruptive technology, which is very much in its infancy, and which
*15:25.940- 15:30.840* :  is making quick and very unpredictable leaps in terms of how quickly it is developing.
*15:30.840- 15:34.520* :  So policymakers and regulators are really playing catch-up here.
*15:34.520- 15:38.880* :  The EU has already reached a provisional deal, which could lead to the world's first
*15:39.460- 15:41.280* :  laws on AI already next year.
*15:41.680- 15:46.600* :  But the US, the UK and China have yet to publish guidelines on this.
*15:46.600- 15:51.460* :  But with growing public awareness about AI, there's also growing pressure on policymakers
*15:51.460- 15:52.040* :  take action.
*15:52.060- 15:57.720* :  So hopefully, that happens on time to avoid the more negative effects that this report
*15:57.720- 15:58.300* :  talks about.
*16:00.100- 16:06.920* :  Now, how rich is rich at a time of growing wealth disparities worldwide, at least one
*16:06.920- 16:12.780* :  answer, is very rich indeed, and how the charity Oxfam has predicted that the world could
*16:12.780- 16:18.080* :  soon have its first trillionaire, with more details than US$8.
*16:19.100- 16:25.260* :  It's estimated that the scourge of poverty around the world would take 200 years to eradicate,
*16:25.860- 16:31.580* :  but Oxfam predicts that it will take just 10 years for the world to witness its first
*16:31.580- 16:32.380* :  trillionaire.
*16:32.760- 16:38.400* :  The charity says, while 5 billion people were made poorer, the combined wealth of the
*16:38.400- 16:44.640* :  world's top five richest men, including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, has more than doubled
*16:44.640- 16:54.840* :  from $405 billion in 2020 to more than $869 billion in 2023.
*16:55.440- 16:58.800* :  Katie Chalrabotty is a spokeswoman for Oxfam.
*16:58.900- 17:03.760* :  No individual, no corporation, should have this much power over our lives.
*17:04.240- 17:07.440* :  Nobody should have a billion dollars, let alone a trillion dollars.
*17:07.440- 17:10.760* :  This is not the kind of economy that we need to overcome poverty.
*17:11.260- 17:14.060* :  It's not the kind of economy in which most people will thrive.
*17:14.680- 17:21.060* :  Oxfam says this disparity was supercharged by the pandemic, which created havoc in economies,
*17:21.660- 17:27.340* :  and that meant that the developed countries could not provide financial aid to poorer nations.
*17:27.980- 17:33.240* :  The group says action is needed and is calling on governments to reduce this widening gap
*17:33.240- 17:38.520* :  between the ultra-rich and the poor by reigning in corporate power.
*17:39.160- 17:45.040* :  So if you need reigning, a trillion has 12 zeros, a million million.
*17:45.040- 17:47.180* :  Sunita Nahar with that report.
*17:50.160- 17:52.720* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*17:53.180- 17:57.780* :  After this eruption that started yesterday, I don't think that we are ever going to be
*17:57.780- 18:00.260* :  safe or feel safe in town again.
*18:00.780- 18:06.180* :  The Icelandic volcano that's left residents in Grindavik with a big dilemma about their
*18:06.180- 18:06.980* :  future homes.
*18:15.940- 18:22.300* :  The U.S. President Joe Biden has congratulated Guatemala's newly-derbanado Are Valo, calling
*18:22.300- 18:27.980* :  his inauguration on Monday a testament to our shared commitment to democracy and the
*18:27.980- 18:28.840* :  will of the people.
*18:29.240- 18:33.880* :  Mr. Biden said he looked forward to continuing the strong partnership between the two nations.
*18:34.440- 18:40.400* :  On his first full day as President Mr. Are Valo promised to fight corruption, but admitted
*18:40.400- 18:46.420* :  his expecting to face monumental challenges, wearing the presidential sash across his chest,
*18:46.420- 18:51.860* :  he said that many had worried that the country could be backsliding into dictatorship, but
*18:51.860- 18:54.020* :  Guatemala's institutions had held strong.
*18:55.500- 19:00.700* :  We must take responsibility for the present, and the present in Guatemala offers us tremendous
*19:01.220- 19:02.220* :  challenges that we can't ignore.
*19:02.500- 19:05.120* :  Guatemala has suffered deep wounds that require healing.
*19:05.620- 19:10.620* :  The President won the election back in August, but has faced multiple attempts to prevent
*19:10.620- 19:11.720* :  him from taking office.
*19:12.200- 19:17.440* :  On Monday, the U.S. said it planned to host Mr. Are Valo in Washington in the coming months
*19:17.460- 19:18.800* :  in a show of support.
*19:19.100- 19:21.300* :  So how crucial has the U.S.
*19:21.620- 19:21.960* :  role been?
*19:21.960- 19:24.960* :  Our Central America correspondent is Will Grant.
*19:25.540- 19:30.520* :  Pretty crucial, actually, I think, Washington has really from the very moment that, by another
*19:30.520- 19:39.180* :  Are Valo, won, shown its backing to a calm and ordered passing of the button.
*19:39.760- 19:41.360* :  That, of course, hasn't taken place.
*19:41.360- 19:48.200* :  There has been real obstacles put in place by lawmakers loyal to the outgoing administration.
*19:49.380- 19:54.980* :  Many of them accused a graft and corruption themselves who are very, very concerned, it seems,
*19:55.580- 20:00.880* :  about this anti-corruption platform that Mr. Are Valo ran on, and the feeling that he
*20:00.880- 20:05.380* :  will make very, very uncomfortable for those with investigations into them, and that there
*20:05.380- 20:09.140* :  will be a sort of swear against some of the entrenched powers in what is one of the poorest
*20:09.140- 20:10.500* :  nations in Central America.
*20:10.960- 20:15.000* :  Yet, remind us of the attempts to stop him from becoming the head of state.
*20:15.480- 20:20.200* :  Well, there's been a variety, most of them legal challenges, through a corrupt judicial
*20:20.200- 20:25.700* :  system and individual judges and so on, loyal to the outgoing administration.
*20:26.640- 20:31.940* :  What happened around the inauguration itself was extremely concerning, and a lot of people
*20:31.940- 20:36.520* :  were worried when it just went on and on, the hours passed, and he still hadn't been
*20:36.520- 20:41.560* :  sworn in as president, that there would be some genuine attempt to stop him from taking
*20:41.560- 20:44.300* :  power, that this was going to be some kind of attempt that coup d'état.
*20:44.800- 20:48.860* :  It didn't happen in the end, albeit nine hours late, he was sworn in.
*20:49.420- 20:50.120* :  Well, grant.
*20:50.620- 20:55.940* :  Gaza is home to some of the oldest churches and mosques in the world, but many have not
*20:55.940- 21:00.680* :  escaped the widespread destruction during Israel's continued bombardment of the region.
*21:00.700- 21:06.240* :  The BBC World Service is established that 72 mosques, as well as two churches, have been
*21:06.240- 21:11.040* :  destroyed or damaged between the 7th of October and the end of last year.
*21:11.280- 21:17.420* :  Our global religion reporter, Reha Kansara, has been leading this investigation, given
*21:17.420- 21:22.000* :  that 1% of Gaza's population have lost their lives in the conflict.
*21:22.000- 21:25.180* :  I asked her why this story about buildings matters.
*21:25.620- 21:32.320* :  Because it is under international humanitarian law defined as a war crime, unless these religious
*21:32.320- 21:35.000* :  buildings are being used for military purposes.
*21:35.000- 21:41.060* :  Now, Israel's defence forces say that some of these mosques are being used by Hamas
*21:41.300- 21:42.960* :  as military strongholds.
*21:42.960- 21:48.940* :  So what we're seeing is an influx of mosques in particular and the damage of some churches
*21:49.380- 21:51.680* :  in Gaza, which has led to many deaths.
*21:51.980- 21:57.700* :  Because presumably these buildings are still viewed by people who've lost everything as a place of sanctuary.
*21:58.100- 22:04.420* :  Yes, of course, and particularly for the Palestinian-Christian community, churches have become a place
*22:04.420- 22:05.800* :  to seek refuge.
*22:06.120- 22:10.600* :  If you compare it to some of the scenes that are coming out of Raffa in the south of Gaza
*22:10.600- 22:14.180* :  of plastic tents, at least you have a real roof over your head.
*22:14.180- 22:15.420* :  You may have running water.
*22:15.420- 22:19.100* :  The conditions are much better than some of these makeshift camps.
*22:19.420- 22:25.660* :  Thus far, we haven't heard from the IDF that churches are being used by Hamas.
*22:26.160- 22:32.440* :  But mosques in particular are being emphasised as Hamas strongholds by the IDF.
*22:32.440- 22:33.980* :  We haven't been able to verify.
*22:34.420- 22:36.400* :  How many are Hamas strongholds?
*22:36.400- 22:37.980* :  We don't have any data on that.
*22:37.980- 22:41.200* :  We also don't know how many IDF have targeted,
*22:41.200- 22:44.860* :  but we do know that overwhelmingly mosques are being targeted.
*22:45.600- 22:48.220* :  And some of these buildings places with enormous history?
*22:48.580- 22:53.080* :  Yes, so for example, the Great Amari Mosque and St Porfirius Church,
*22:53.080- 22:55.300* :  they are both in Gaza's old city.
*22:55.920- 22:57.160* :  Experts have told me,
*22:57.280- 23:01.760* :  these ancient places of worship can be seen to be considered evidence
*23:01.760- 23:04.700* :  that Palestinians existed on this land centuries ago.
*23:04.880- 23:08.820* :  Am I right to say that St Porfirius is the third oldest church in the world?
*23:09.040- 23:11.500* :  Yes, it's considered to be the third oldest church in the world.
*23:11.500- 23:13.620* :  It's still standing to this day,
*23:13.620- 23:16.660* :  people who are sheltering there are attending Sunday Mass,
*23:16.700- 23:19.540* :  as they can under conditions of war.
*23:19.840- 23:21.400* :  And you've heard horror stories?
*23:21.580- 23:25.600* :  One lady I spoke to who is sheltering in St Porfirius Church.
*23:26.340- 23:30.680* :  She fled there with her family and her husband, her child and her parents.
*23:31.440- 23:36.420* :  Her brother-in-law died when an airstrike hit part of the outbuildings
*23:36.580- 23:37.720* :  in the church's complex.
*23:37.800- 23:40.000* :  And this has terrified her.
*23:40.000- 23:42.000* :  She told me she's never seen a dead body before.
*23:42.880- 23:44.640* :  He died saving his own child.
*23:45.440- 23:46.880* :  She has a young one herself.
*23:47.060- 23:50.160* :  And just recently, she had her baby baptized
*23:50.460- 23:55.100* :  because she fears that her baby will also die without being baptized.
*23:55.400- 23:57.780* :  How did you go about collating this information?
*23:58.280- 24:01.440* :  The first instance was to look at Twitter
*24:02.000- 24:04.100* :  day by day within our time frame,
*24:04.100- 24:08.460* :  which was 7th October when the war began, and 31st December,
*24:08.780- 24:13.280* :  and find instances of mosques being destroyed or targeted.
*24:13.820- 24:16.520* :  And so we were using such terms, such as mosque church,
*24:17.140- 24:18.940* :  attacked, destroyed Gaza.
*24:19.340- 24:21.940* :  And then we would list the names of mosques
*24:22.080- 24:27.920* :  or unknown mosques in Gaza that had been reportedly damaged or destroyed.
*24:27.920- 24:31.480* :  And then we would go through verifying those using satellite imagery
*24:32.320- 24:36.500* :  or we would use before and after pictures that came up on Twitter,
*24:36.500- 24:40.620* :  now known as X, and comparing them to before pictures that are on Google.
*24:41.100- 24:42.780* :  But it was a very lengthy process,
*24:42.780- 24:47.260* :  which is why we kept our time frame of 7th October to 31st December.
*24:47.500- 24:50.180* :  I know you've tried to contact the Israeli military.
*24:50.180- 24:51.920* :  Have you had any response on any of this?
*24:52.080- 24:53.660* :  We've had an initial response.
*24:53.660- 24:58.220* :  The IDF say that Hamas militants are using places of worship
*24:58.220- 25:00.820* :  as cover and a place to launch attacks from.
*25:01.520- 25:03.360* :  But going back to what I was saying earlier,
*25:03.360- 25:05.860* :  it's really unclear how many of these religious sites
*25:05.860- 25:08.300* :  that were verified have been destroyed by the IDF
*25:08.300- 25:10.920* :  or how many are being used by Hamas.
*25:11.160- 25:15.760* :  However, the IDF do say that they are acting in accordance with international law
*25:15.760- 25:19.420* :  to dismantle Hamas' military and administrative capabilities.
*25:20.260- 25:23.000* :  And taking precautions to mitigate civilian harm.
*25:23.260- 25:24.360* :  Reha Kansara.
*25:24.600- 25:28.100* :  Mauritius is experiencing heavy flooding as a tropical cyclone
*25:28.100- 25:30.440* :  closes in on the Indian Ocean island
*25:30.440- 25:33.360* :  after battering the nearby island of reunion.
*25:33.800- 25:35.880* :  The Mauritius meteorological services
*25:35.880- 25:38.440* :  urged the public to stay in safe places
*25:38.440- 25:40.440* :  with more torrential rain expected
*25:40.880- 25:43.580* :  Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton reports.
*25:47.840- 25:50.340* :  This footage posted on social media
*25:50.780- 25:53.420* :  shows many cars in the capital port Louis
*25:53.900- 25:56.300* :  submerged under brown flood water
*25:56.640- 25:58.040* :  or piled up on the streets.
*25:58.880- 26:02.660* :  Some people can be seen sitting stranded on the roofs of their vehicles
*26:02.660- 26:04.960* :  not daring to brave the waters.
*26:05.900- 26:08.060* :  In Reunion, one person has died
*26:08.060- 26:11.880* :  and around 600 others have been forced to leave their homes.
*26:12.540- 26:15.420* :  Around a quarter of households there are without electricity
*26:15.500- 26:18.140* :  and thousands have no running water.
*26:18.940- 26:23.420* :  The authorities in Reunion had raised the storm alert level to violet
*26:23.420- 26:26.640* :  the highest level as the cyclone approached
*26:27.260- 26:29.240* :  but it's now been downgraded to red
*26:29.700- 26:32.360* :  to allow the security services to move around.
*26:33.360- 26:35.020* :  Despite the dire warnings
*26:35.520- 26:39.120* :  Reunion appears to have been spared the worst of the cyclone
*26:39.460- 26:42.340* :  as the eye of the storm passed further to the north.
*26:43.380- 26:46.260* :  Richard Hamilton, as you may have heard
*26:46.260- 26:48.420* :  in a previous global news podcast
*26:48.420- 26:51.420* :  Iceland witnessed a second volcanic eruption
*26:51.420- 26:54.080* :  over the weekend that destroyed several houses
*26:54.480- 26:56.360* :  in the fishing town of Grindavik.
*26:56.720- 26:58.880* :  The population was evacuated again
*26:58.880- 27:01.580* :  hours before this latest eruption
*27:01.580- 27:04.140* :  and an emergency was declared in the area.
*27:04.660- 27:07.420* :  Andrea Avars-Dottier is a resident
*27:07.420- 27:10.000* :  and the town's library director.
*27:10.440- 27:13.500* :  She spoke to the BBC when the volcano first erupted
*27:13.500- 27:14.920* :  just a week before Christmas.
*27:15.460- 27:18.340* :  Evan Davis caught up with her and asked how she felt
*27:18.800- 27:19.880* :  after this latest one.
*27:20.400- 27:23.800* :  This is like a really, really strange situation to be in
*27:24.000- 27:27.340* :  and my feelings are very, very torn between
*27:27.340- 27:30.260* :  of course wanting everything to be okay
*27:30.260- 27:34.280* :  but also at the same time just wanting an eruption
*27:34.280- 27:37.100* :  in town to just get this over with
*27:37.460- 27:39.800* :  because after this eruption that started yesterday
*27:40.540- 27:43.100* :  I don't think that we are ever going to be safe
*27:43.100- 27:45.140* :  or feel safe in town again.
*27:45.640- 27:47.000* :  You don't think you could move back?
*27:47.420- 27:49.980* :  No, there is no way that I'm moving back.
*27:50.460- 27:54.400* :  I watched three houses from people that I know
*27:54.400- 27:58.040* :  personally go up in flames when the lava
*27:58.680- 27:59.400* :  engulfed them
*28:00.100- 28:03.920* :  and I'm never going to put myself or my sons
*28:03.920- 28:05.040* :  in this situation.
*28:05.700- 28:08.360* :  Andrea, just talk me through the gritty sort of detail
*28:08.360- 28:10.800* :  of insurance. I mean if your house is burned down
*28:10.840- 28:13.160* :  I'm presuming there's insurance either the state
*28:13.160- 28:15.600* :  or the insurance company pays for it, does it?
*28:15.840- 28:18.820* :  Yes, so we have what is called a national
*28:18.820- 28:23.560* :  natural disaster insurance which is paid by the government.
*28:24.860- 28:29.260* :  That insurance goes into act when there is
*28:29.680- 28:34.160* :  earthquakes or avalanches or volcanic eruptions
*28:34.220- 28:38.260* :  or any natural disaster that takes out all houses.
*28:39.140- 28:41.760* :  So your house has to be like completely ruined
*28:42.220- 28:46.380* :  by the event itself for the national natural
*28:46.380- 28:48.800* :  disaster insurance to come into effect.
*28:49.700- 28:53.820* :  But my house is fine, it's not ruined, it's not even
*28:54.280- 28:56.400* :  badly damaged after all of the earthquakes
*28:57.540- 28:59.800* :  but our normal insurance.
*28:59.800- 29:03.720* :  As soon as a natural disaster starts to happen
*29:03.720- 29:09.200* :  those insurances are void because the natural disaster
*29:09.200- 29:11.040* :  insurance should take over.
*29:11.620- 29:16.020* :  But if your house is fine and it's still in our area
*29:16.020- 29:19.280* :  that is uninhabitable like Grinterik is at the moment
*29:20.000- 29:23.120* :  we are like sort of in between those two insurances
*29:23.560- 29:25.220* :  and we are getting nothing.
*29:25.640- 29:28.900* :  And if you don't go back and you don't get insurance money
*29:28.900- 29:31.180* :  to pay out because your house isn't going to be damaged
*29:31.180- 29:33.220* :  probably what are your choices?
*29:33.220- 29:36.820* :  You basically have to kind of start again I suppose, do you?
*29:37.240- 29:39.720* :  Yeah, so there are a few possibilities.
*29:39.720- 29:41.540* :  I'm almost 47.
*29:42.380- 29:47.240* :  So I have a lot of money invested in my house
*29:47.840- 29:50.860* :  but I'm still young enough to be able to start again.
*29:51.880- 29:54.920* :  But to start again I would have to declare bankruptcy
*29:54.920- 29:58.440* :  because either I would have to keep on paying off the mortgage
*29:58.440- 30:02.140* :  off the house in Grinterik and rent in Reykjavík
*30:02.140- 30:03.740* :  and there is no way I can do that.
*30:03.740- 30:05.600* :  So I would have to file for bankruptcy
*30:05.600- 30:08.660* :  if I don't get bought out by the government.
*30:09.560- 30:13.480* :  Andrea Avars.air speaking to Evan Davis from Iceland.
*30:14.200- 30:16.660* :  Italy's government has been caught up in a scandal
*30:16.660- 30:20.280* :  after its junior culture minister was accused of possessing
*30:20.280- 30:23.740* :  and exhibiting a stolen 17th century painting.
*30:23.740- 30:27.000* :  Vittorio's Garby has been put under investigation
*30:27.000- 30:29.020* :  for laundering stolen goods.
*30:29.400- 30:32.860* :  He's also being questioned about the illegal export of another painting.
*30:33.240- 30:34.700* :  He denies all the charges.
*30:35.140- 30:39.100* :  Our correspondent in Rome Mark Lohan takes up the story.
*30:39.780- 30:42.580* :  Vittorio's Garby's career as a junior minister,
*30:42.580- 30:47.640* :  art critic and TV personality has been peppered with convictions for slander
*30:47.980- 30:50.320* :  during his often foul mouthed outbursts.
*30:50.740- 30:53.200* :  Now he's in even deeper legal hot water.
*30:53.800- 30:56.260* :  The politician is being investigated for owning a work
*30:56.260- 30:59.700* :  called The Capture of St. Peter by the 17th-century artist
*30:59.700- 31:03.000* :  Rodilio Manetti, which was allegedly stolen from a castle
*31:03.000- 31:04.720* :  in Northern Italy in 2013.
*31:05.500- 31:08.540* :  He's also accused of adding the image of a candle to the corner
*31:08.880- 31:09.960* :  to hide its authenticity.
*31:10.680- 31:13.240* :  Mr. Garby says he found the painting in a villa
*31:13.240- 31:17.360* :  bought by his mother and that the canvas cut out of the castle was a copy.
*31:17.960- 31:20.440* :  Now he's facing accusations over a different work,
*31:20.440- 31:23.980* :  one attributed to the French painter Valentin de Boulogne,
*31:24.340- 31:26.800* :  with an estimated value of five million euros
*31:26.800- 31:29.100* :  seized by police in Monte Carlo.
*31:29.100- 31:32.680* :  Mr. Garby is being investigated for its illegal exploitation.
*31:32.780- 31:35.800* :  He claims it's a copy which he did not own.
*31:36.460- 31:39.240* :  Opposition parties have called for Mr. Garby's dismissal.
*31:39.300- 31:42.240* :  He went on Italian TV to defend his actions
*31:42.240- 31:45.220* :  with language too colorful to repeat.
*31:46.180- 31:47.640* :  Mark Lohan in Rome.
*31:48.740- 31:52.900* :  It's been 14 years since the cult video game series
*31:52.900- 31:55.700* :  Prince of Persia last had a new edition,
*31:55.700- 31:58.700* :  but the latest reboot makes an extra effort
*31:59.060- 32:01.440* :  to respect Iranian and Persian culture.
*32:01.940- 32:04.040* :  Here's our reporter, Ella Bignol.
*32:09.200- 32:12.580* :  Think 1,000 and one nights mix with a bit of Indiana Jones
*32:12.580- 32:14.220* :  and a touch of Robin Hood.
*32:14.660- 32:17.200* :  Prince of Persia is an action-adventure video game
*32:17.200- 32:21.280* :  franchise beloved by millions since its first launch in 1989.
*32:21.500- 32:24.720* :  In 2010, it was adapted into a Hollywood movie
*32:24.720- 32:28.220* :  and its characters have even been immortalized as Lego figures,
*32:28.540- 32:30.580* :  but it wasn't terribly well Persian.
*32:31.060- 32:33.980* :  So the developers Ubisoft wanted the latest in the series,
*32:33.980- 32:36.020* :  The Lost Crown, which is out this week,
*32:36.420- 32:39.640* :  to better depict Persian mythology and Iranian culture.
*32:44.620- 32:47.240* :  The Rebeats is available in Farsi and the gameplay
*32:47.240- 32:49.740* :  weaves in elements of the Zora Astrian religion,
*32:50.200- 32:52.100* :  which was founded in what is now Iran.
*32:52.100- 32:55.440* :  The game's producers told the BBC that they're very proud
*32:55.440- 32:58.320* :  to have made the changes, and it's gone down well with fans,
*32:58.320- 33:00.800* :  with some saying it's a huge step forward
*33:00.800- 33:03.680* :  in showing the culture that's often underrepresented
*33:04.220- 33:05.100* :  in Western media.
*33:09.180- 33:10.200* :  Let's try it.
*33:16.540- 33:17.480* :  Ella Bicknall.
*33:20.620- 33:22.720* :  And that's all from us for now,

*33:25.820- 33:29.620* :  Later, this edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll

*34:00.220- 34:04.920* :  The story's twisted turn until each one ends with the explosion
*34:05.320- 34:07.760* :  of a new far-reaching culture war.
*34:07.880- 34:10.440* :  If you tell me that my nephew had superhuman strength,
*34:10.440- 34:12.940* :  if you tell me that he didn't fill any pain,
*34:13.440- 34:14.460* :  well, he's dead now.
