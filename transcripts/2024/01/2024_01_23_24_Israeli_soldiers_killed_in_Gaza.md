*01:34.340- 01:37.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:39.780- 01:46.620* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 23rd of January, these are our main stories.
*01:46.620- 01:52.040* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive in Gaza
*01:52.040- 01:58.160* :  despite the deaths of 21 soldiers in a single incident, voting as underway in New Hampshire,
*01:58.160- 02:03.560* :  where Donald Trump is seeking to seal his nomination as the Republican presidential candidate.
*02:04.040- 02:06.520* :  And the Oscar nominations are in.
*02:09.020- 02:14.700* :  Also in this podcast the wives of Russian servicemen are speaking out against the war in Ukraine.
*02:15.180- 02:19.440* :  When will they decide that our husbands have discharged their military duty?
*02:19.720- 02:22.100* :  When they are brought back to us with no arms and legs?
*02:25.720- 02:31.320* :  We start in Jerusalem where there were prayers at the funeral of an Israeli soldier killed in Gaza
*02:40.120- 02:45.160* :  on Monday. He was among 21 reservists who died three other soldiers were killed in a separate
*02:45.160- 02:51.380* :  incident. This was the biggest daily loss of life in Israel's military since its ground operations
*02:51.380- 02:57.420* :  began in Gaza in October. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences.
*03:03.040- 03:08.640* :  Yesterday was one of the hardest days since the war broke out. We lost 24 of our best sons,
*03:08.640- 03:12.820* :  the heroes who fell defending the homeland. Together with the citizens of Israel,
*03:13.420- 03:15.320* :  I agree for each and every one of them.
*03:15.760- 03:20.640* :  Mr Netanyahu went on to say that the Israeli military is looking into what he called the
*03:20.640- 03:26.740* :  disaster and Israel would push for what he called, quote, absolute victory. I asked our correspondent
*03:26.760- 03:29.920* :  in Jerusalem, Mark Lohan, how the soldiers were killed.
*03:30.140- 03:34.180* :  Well, the chief spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces, Daniel Hagari,
*03:34.180- 03:41.780* :  has said that the soldiers were preparing explosives to bring down two buildings when what he
*03:41.780- 03:47.960* :  described as a militant toward it was terrorist actually in the words of the Israelis fired a
*03:47.960- 03:53.540* :  rocket propelled grenade at a tank nearby and that basically precipitated the explosions,
*03:53.540- 03:58.980* :  the buildings to actually detonate early, which was what killed 21 soldiers. There was a separate
*03:58.980- 04:04.060* :  incident that killed three in southern Gaza as well. And President Isaac Herzog has spoken,
*04:04.060- 04:07.920* :  and he said it is an unbearably difficult morning for the country.
*04:08.120- 04:13.600* :  Mr Netanyahu also said in his comments that Khan Unis in Gaza is now encircled.
*04:13.760- 04:17.840* :  Yeah, indeed. It's been very much the focus of the Israeli offensive in recent days because
*04:17.840- 04:22.360* :  the Israelis believe that that is where the top Hamas commanders are holed up either in the city
*04:22.360- 04:27.620* :  or beneath the city in tunnels. And they now say that the Israeli Defence Forces say that
*04:27.620- 04:31.440* :  they have completely encircled the city. There are still hundreds of thousands of people thought
*04:31.440- 04:37.320* :  to be sheltering in Khan Unis. And there are reports that the Israelis are besieging one hospital,
*04:37.320- 04:41.540* :  at least one hospital there. They've stormed another hospital and arrested the medical staff.
*04:41.540- 04:47.340* :  Israel insists that Hamas uses medical facilities to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.
*04:47.700- 04:53.420* :  That is something that both Medics in Gaza and Hamas deny. But very much I think
*04:53.420- 04:58.140* :  Khan Unis is in the grip of the Israelis now. And it's meant that actually many of the residents
*04:58.140- 05:02.140* :  in Khan Unis have been forced even further south into Raffa right on the border with Egypt,
*05:02.140- 05:06.800* :  which had a pre-war population of just under 300,000. But it's now thought to be sheltering
*05:06.800- 05:13.640* :  some 1.4 million people. Hamas, of course, saying more than 25,000 people have now died in Gaza
*05:13.640- 05:19.240* :  in this war. But reports mark of Israel suggesting a two-month pause.
*05:19.660- 05:25.700* :  Well, this is a report that appeared in the US media and the website Axios that said that Israel
*05:25.700- 05:31.960* :  had proposed a two-month ceasefire, or truce, in which it would demand the release of all the
*05:31.960- 05:37.360* :  hostages and the bodies of the dead hostages. Remember, Israel assesses that about perhaps up to 30
*05:37.360- 05:43.680* :  of the remaining 130 hostages also in Gaza have been killed. In return for that,
*05:43.680- 05:46.960* :  there would be an unknown number of Palestinian prisoners who would be freed from Israel
*05:47.400- 05:52.860* :  and Israeli forces would begin to withdraw from some areas in Gaza. But it hasn't yet. There's
*05:52.860- 05:57.420* :  not been a word from Hamas yet. And I think we're still quite far from any deal if indeed that is
*05:57.420- 06:04.140* :  approved. Mark Lohan. The Houthis who control a large part of Yemen and are allies of Hamas have
*06:04.140- 06:08.680* :  warned that they will take revenge after America and Britain carried out their most extensive
*06:08.680- 06:14.420* :  strikes yet. The Houthis say every aggression or meter response, several sites linked to the
*06:14.420- 06:19.120* :  group were bombed overnight. It's the second time the US and UK have conducted coordinated
*06:19.120- 06:24.860* :  retaliatory strikes on the Houthis missile launching operations in Yemen after weeks of
*06:24.860- 06:30.660* :  attacks by Yemeni fighters on vessels in the Red Sea region. The British Prime Minister Rishisunak
*06:30.660- 06:36.020* :  said the US and UK countermeasures sent the clearest possible message to the Houthis.
*06:36.400- 06:42.860* :  We are not seeking a confrontation. We urge the Houthis and those who enable them to stop
*06:42.860- 06:49.940* :  these illegal and unacceptable attacks. But if necessary, the United Kingdom will not
*06:49.940- 06:56.540* :  hesitate to respond again in self-defense. We cannot stand by and allow these attacks to go
*06:56.540- 07:04.360* :  unchallenged. Inaction is also a choice. From Gaza to Iran, Iraq to Yemen barely a day goes by
*07:04.360- 07:09.480* :  without reports of some new flashpoint in the region. We've heard warnings of the danger of a
*07:09.480- 07:15.560* :  wider regional conflict. For the BBC's five questions on podcast unpacking conflicts in the
*07:15.560- 07:20.820* :  Middle East, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, along with some of our regional experts,
*07:21.380- 07:26.300* :  analyzes these developments for you and look at where these disparate issues connect.
*07:26.960- 07:31.880* :  Clearly something happened last October that brought a whole lot of regional tensions and
*07:31.880- 07:37.760* :  rivalries out into the open in a dangerously violent way. Our Middle East correspondent,
*07:37.760- 07:42.560* :  Yolanda Nell, has been following Israel's military campaign in Gaza since the beginning,
*07:42.560- 07:48.240* :  three and a half months on from the Hamas attacks of October the 7th. What has that campaign
*07:48.240- 07:52.020* :  achieved? And how much longer is it likely to go on?
*07:52.220- 07:56.960* :  The immediate future does look set to involve more intense fighting in Gaza, particularly in
*07:57.100- 08:02.460* :  the South, where dozens of Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the latest Israeli
*08:02.460- 08:08.560* :  strikes. Also, continuing heartache for the Israeli families of the remaining 100-plus hostages
*08:08.560- 08:14.100* :  held by Hamas, who've been holding rallies. But diplomatically, there's a lot going on which
*08:14.100- 08:19.320* :  will shape the longer term. While public statements by Hamas and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*08:19.320- 08:25.640* :  Netanyahu still seem far apart, there are said to be serious mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt
*08:25.640- 08:32.200* :  with US involvement on a possible new hostage release deal. And while Mr Netanyahu's reaffirmed his
*08:32.200- 08:38.080* :  hard line against the creation of a Palestinian state, saying it would pose an existential danger
*08:38.080- 08:43.320* :  to Israel, we're not going to stop hearing about the two-state solution. Israel's allies,
*08:43.320- 08:49.000* :  the US, the UK, and today the European Union with a meeting in Brussels, Arab countries too,
*08:49.000- 08:54.440* :  or say they want to work towards this, and that ultimately it's the only way to end the decades
*08:54.440- 08:59.280* :  old conflict here. Okay, next to the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula,
*08:59.280- 09:05.140* :  over a thousand miles away. Now, the hoothies that controls a big chunk of Northern Yemen
*09:05.140- 09:11.680* :  started firing missiles towards Israel back in October. In solidarity, they said with the Palestinians
*09:11.680- 09:17.880* :  in Gaza. Then, they turned their attention to shipping in the nearby Red Sea. The BBC's
*09:17.880- 09:23.920* :  security correspondent Frank Gardner now picks up that thread. Well, in one sense, these strikes by
*09:23.920- 09:29.520* :  the US primarily have failed because the hoothies are still firing missiles at shipping, which they
*09:29.520- 09:36.740* :  believe are either connected to Israel or the US or to the UK. But the hoothies haven't got an
*09:36.740- 09:43.560* :  inexhaustible supply of missiles, and these are slowly being degraded by the US strikes. I think
*09:43.560- 09:48.880* :  the US is hoping to send a message to Yemen that it can calibrate its response. It can step up
*09:48.880- 09:54.380* :  these attacks. At the moment, they're being quite limited. They're only targeting very specific
*09:54.380- 10:01.300* :  sites like radar, airfields and so on. But they could step that up if the hoothies try to escalate
*10:01.300- 10:09.860* :  this. So it's still quite a worrying flashpoint in the wider sort of galaxy of Middle East and
*10:09.860- 10:15.980* :  flashpoints. Another volatile area since October has been Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
*10:16.660- 10:22.320* :  For months, we've seen skirmishes between the Israeli army and Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful
*10:22.320- 10:28.780* :  Shiite militia. Hugo Bachega, another of the BBC's Middle East correspondence, is in the Lebanese
*10:28.780- 10:35.840* :  capital Beirut. Hugo, where do we stand? Well, Paul, at the moment, this violence between Hezbollah and
*10:35.840- 10:44.000* :  Israel has been largely contained to the border areas between Lebanon and Israel. But miscalculation
*10:44.000- 10:50.960* :  is always a risk. And I don't think the threat of a major conflict is over. Hezbollah has been
*10:50.960- 10:57.160* :  calibrating its attacks because it doesn't want to trigger a major confrontation with Israel.
*10:57.720- 11:04.100* :  And the Israelis have been threatening to give a strong response to Hezbollah. The
*11:04.100- 11:10.300* :  Defence Minister in Israel has said the Israeli military could copy and paste what it's done in
*11:10.300- 11:17.780* :  Gaza here in Beirut. And I think here, this is the fear that Israel could trigger a conflict.
*11:18.400- 11:23.900* :  The rhetoric from Israeli officials is that, look, we're going to have to deal with Hezbollah.
*11:24.420- 11:31.480* :  And we know that some senior figures inside the Israeli government are in favor of a major
*11:31.480- 11:37.160* :  offensive against Hezbollah, which is something that could be catastrophic, not only for Lebanon,
*11:37.160- 11:45.120* :  but also for Israel. Hezbollah is much more powerful than Hamas. He has thousands of well-trained
*11:45.120- 11:52.680* :  fighters, tens of thousands of missiles and rockets, including precision-guided missiles that can
*11:52.680- 12:00.720* :  strike deep inside Israel. So any conflict between Israel and Hezbollah would be extremely dangerous
*12:01.140- 12:06.680* :  and unpredictable. Now, if there's one thing that links Hezbollah in Lebanon with Hamas in Gaza
*12:06.680- 12:12.520* :  and the Houthis in Yemen, it's that all three are backed in one way or another by Iran.
*12:13.200- 12:17.800* :  So what's Iran up to? Here's Kastranarji of the BBC's Persian service.
*12:18.200- 12:22.140* :  Iran's policies in the region are decided by the Supreme Leader,
*12:22.140- 12:27.420* :  Aitullah Ali Hamini, and he has decided that he does not want Iran to get involved directly
*12:27.420- 12:34.540* :  in a war in Israel or with the United States. The obvious reason being the imbalance of military
*12:34.540- 12:40.660* :  power between Iran on one hand and Israel on the other hand or between Iran and the US.
*12:41.440- 12:46.340* :  There is another reason for that lack of populist support for the regime as a whole
*12:46.520- 12:52.460* :  or for a war a thousand kilometers away from Iran's borders. But by staying away from the
*12:52.460- 12:57.580* :  war, the Supreme Leader and his revolutionary guard have opened themselves to the criticism
*12:57.580- 13:03.620* :  from their own hard-line supporters, their support base, that they are showing weakness.
*13:03.620- 13:09.780* :  So one of the ways that Iran can project power is to launch occasional missiles into Iraq or
*13:09.780- 13:17.080* :  Pakistan or Syria and say they have targeted Israeli interests or targeted terrorist high-darts
*13:17.340- 13:25.300* :  or use their client militias in these countries in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen to cause a lot of trouble
*13:25.320- 13:30.180* :  and they are causing a lot of trouble. As we've already heard, America has found itself being
*13:30.180- 13:36.560* :  sucked into this toxic Middle East and vortex. And so since October, we've seen the Biden
*13:36.560- 13:42.940* :  administration trying repeatedly to put out the fires. How's that going? Our Washington colleague
*13:42.940- 13:48.440* :  Anthony Zurcher has had a front row seat as he's criss-crossed the region with the US Secretary of
*13:48.440- 13:53.440* :  State, Anthony Blinken. Hey, Paul, I've been on a couple of Anthony Blinken's trips to the
*13:53.440- 13:59.020* :  Midis the past few months and one message I've heard over and over from the US Secretary of State and
*13:59.020- 14:04.900* :  his team is that preventing a region-wide conflict is a central focus of their efforts.
*14:05.540- 14:09.900* :  That's been reflected in all the ground we've covered on these trips. Turkey and Iraq, the Persian
*14:09.900- 14:15.800* :  Gulf, Israel and the West Bank, Egypt, back and forth. The Americans have had mixed success,
*14:15.800- 14:21.280* :  though. The clashes along the Israel Lebanon border, for instance, haven't escalated into full
*14:21.280- 14:28.080* :  blown war, but the US is now regularly bombing the Houthis in Yemen. The Americans ultimately see
*14:28.080- 14:34.900* :  ending the Gaza war and settling the Palestinian issue as the only way to ensure a durable peace.
*14:35.440- 14:40.180* :  The US proposal is for the Arab nations to normalize relations with Israel, integration.
*14:40.300- 14:47.060* :  In exchange for Israel working towards an independent United Palestinian state that includes Gaza
*14:47.060- 14:52.960* :  and the West Bank. Paul, you know that's obviously an enormous task, one that has
*14:52.960- 14:58.200* :  stymied Midis negotiators for a generation or more, but that's the US road map for peace,
*14:58.200- 15:03.920* :  and right now they're sticking to it. And for more analysis and explanation, why not
*15:03.920- 15:09.340* :  subscribe to our five questions on podcast. It's available on BBC Sounds.
*15:10.620- 15:16.280* :  Can Donald Trump's seemingly inevitable march towards standing for a second term as US president
*15:16.280- 15:22.080* :  be stopped? Well, New Hampshire, seen as the last stand for the Republican never-Trumpers,
*15:22.620- 15:27.180* :  could move us close to an answer. It's holding its primary day on who should be the Republican
*15:27.180- 15:33.160* :  Party's candidate. The second state to vote after Mr Trump secured a resounding victory in the
*15:33.160- 15:40.040* :  Iowa caucuses. The former US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, is now the last person standing
*15:40.040- 15:45.480* :  against him. North America correspondent Nomiya Ikbal is on the campaign trail.
*15:49.580- 15:55.300* :  New Hampshire's official state motto is, live free or die. And I'm stood in front of a majestic
*15:55.300- 16:01.280* :  bronze statue covered in snow of the man who coined it. General John Stark, the state's most
*16:01.280- 16:06.480* :  distinguished hero during the Revolutionary War. The motto is now used to convey the independence
*16:06.480- 16:13.040* :  of New Hampshire. Nearly 40% of voters here are politically unaffiliated. And one man here
*16:13.040- 16:21.220* :  is hoping to take advantage of that. We meet Robert Schwartz at a local diner. He is from an
*16:21.220- 16:26.120* :  organisation called Primary Pivot. He's a liberal activist who wants to stop Donald Trump's
*16:26.120- 16:31.880* :  momentum. So what's your name? You planning to vote in the primates? Okay, are you registered
*16:31.880- 16:37.480* :  Democrat, Republican or undeclared? Robert's strategy is this, guess as many liberals and left
*16:37.480- 16:43.340* :  leaning independence to turn right and vote for Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley is the only candidate
*16:43.820- 16:49.700* :  that can dent Donald Trump and end this idea that he is the inevitable nominee.
*16:50.540- 16:54.980* :  When you go around speaking to potential voters, do they agree with your message,
*16:55.200- 17:00.380* :  does it resonate with any of them? It is tough, but we have found a pretty large
*17:00.380- 17:07.660* :  reception for left-leaning independent voters. Their top issue, by far, is how much they
*17:07.660- 17:14.080* :  dislike Donald Trump and how much democracy is the central issue for them this election cycle.
*17:16.560- 17:21.440* :  Robert works the room hard. And how are you thinking of voting, yeah?
*17:21.700- 17:25.860* :  And Bingo, he's found a target, an independent voter who leans to the left.
*17:25.860- 17:30.260* :  Why do you think it's such a bad idea? I'm personally just not the more voting person
*17:30.260- 17:35.480* :  that I think my right is the woman. That's not where it works. But what you're then doing is
*17:35.480- 17:41.880* :  letting somebody know over time is roby ways. It didn't work. Not sure how many voters
*17:41.880- 17:47.520* :  Robert got on board in this diner. It is amounted to climb because polls suggest Trump is widening
*17:47.520- 17:50.160* :  the lead over Haley by more than 20 percentage points.
*17:55.240- 17:59.480* :  We've crossed to another part of the state and come to Brown Lobster Pound. It's a local seafood
*17:59.480- 18:04.720* :  fast food restaurant. Dozens and dozens of people are packed in, sat on benches, drinking
*18:04.720- 18:10.100* :  big cups of soda, eating mac and cheese, fried shrimp and chips, waiting for Nikki Haley.
*18:10.220- 18:17.380* :  For as Nikki Haley arrives, news breaks that Florida governor Ronda Santis is out.
*18:17.740- 18:20.600* :  It's now one fella and one lady left.
*18:23.720- 18:25.180* :  May their best woman win.
*18:27.700- 18:33.640* :  Why do you think Nikki Haley's gonna win? She's smart, she's in account, she's beautiful,
*18:33.640- 18:38.740* :  it never hurts to be beautiful. Donald Trump is petrified of her which is exactly why
*18:38.740- 18:41.100* :  he's lying consistently about her record.
*18:44.900- 18:49.620* :  But further up north, that confidence is matched by Donald Trump supporters waiting
*18:49.620- 18:54.020* :  in the sub-zero temperatures for his sold out event at a local opera house.
*18:54.300- 18:57.040* :  I think there's no question non-Trump winning New Hampshire at all.
*18:57.260- 19:01.580* :  At this point both Haley and Decentre's are just distractions that kind of are relevant.
*19:01.980- 19:06.420* :  The stunts just dropped out. I know, yeah and doubly irrelevant then.
*19:07.420- 19:10.680* :  Donald Trump isn't really a candidate but more of a movement.
*19:11.500- 19:17.020* :  If he wins New Hampshire by a huge amount, the race for the Republican nomination will more
*19:17.020- 19:23.960* :  a less beat over. Nomiya Ikbal in New Hampshire. And in fact, the first result from those primaries
*19:23.960- 19:30.860* :  is already in. Nikki Haley won all six votes in the hamlet of Dixville notch, though I should say
*19:31.360- 19:37.460* :  four years ago the Dixville notch primaries were very poor predictors of the nation-wide results.
*19:38.580- 19:44.420* :  The Oscar nominations are in after a huge year for cinema which saw Barbie and Oppenheimer
*19:44.420- 19:49.880* :  dominate the box office. Who can forget the barbenheimer phenomenon when millions of fans
*19:49.880- 19:55.960* :  booked tickets to see both films on the same day? Well, Oppenheimer about the project to develop
*19:55.960- 20:03.360* :  the atomic bomb has topped the list with 13 nominations including Best Director and Best Picture.
*20:03.360- 20:09.240* :  The feminist take on Barbie got eight including Best Picture. Here's our entertainment correspondent
*20:09.240- 20:15.260* :  Colin Patterson. Killian Murphy getting his first ever Oscar nomination for Best Actor for
*20:15.260- 20:20.780* :  playing Oppenheimer. You've got best supporting actress Emily Blunt for playing his wife,
*20:20.780- 20:27.200* :  director Christopher Moonolen who's never won an Oscar. Now is the sure favorite to win his first
*20:27.640- 20:34.380* :  Oscar for Best Director. The thing I cannot get over, Barbie's misses. I don't want to start on
*20:34.380- 20:42.920* :  a negative, but Margot Robbie has been the face of movies for 2023 and she is missed out on
*20:42.920- 20:50.040* :  a Best Actress nomination. And Greta Gerwig has missed out on Best Director. She made the most
*20:50.040- 20:55.700* :  successful film at the box office of last year. She made the most successful film by a woman of
*20:55.700- 21:01.360* :  all time and for the second year in a row there are no females nominated for Best Director at the
*21:01.360- 21:06.380* :  Oscars. I'm afraid to say this will be making a lot of headlines. And what will people be saying?
*21:06.380- 21:10.940* :  All those headlines be saying about those two misses do you think Colin? I think they'll be saying
*21:10.940- 21:15.720* :  what do you have to do to get nominated? There's been the barbenheimer phenomenon has been talked
*21:15.720- 21:20.500* :  about for months. These were the movies that got people back into the cinemas after the pandemic.
*21:20.500- 21:25.840* :  Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie absolutely crucial to that. Huge hit with the critics,
*21:25.840- 21:32.520* :  huge hit with the box office, but the Oscars say no. Neither Margot Robbie for Best Actress or
*21:32.520- 21:39.700* :  Greta Gerwig for Best Director. They have both missed out. Colin Patterson speaking to Lucy Hockings.
*21:39.900- 21:45.580* :  The 96th Oscars ceremony will take place in Hollywood on March the 10th.
*21:47.700- 21:53.820* :  Still to come in this podcast. This one blood biomarker was able to predict whether
*21:53.820- 21:57.980* :  somebody had the proteins in the brain that are the whole Mark of Alzheimer's disease.
*21:58.400- 22:02.700* :  A potential breakthrough in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
*22:09.380- 22:14.260* :  Hi, I'm Una Chaplin and I'm the host of a new podcast called Hollywood Exiles.
*22:14.920- 22:21.320* :  It tells the story of how my grandfather Charlie Chaplin and many others were caught up in a campaign
*22:21.320- 22:28.400* :  to root out communism in Hollywood. It's a story of glamour and scandal and political intrigue
*22:28.940- 22:36.220* :  and a battle for the soul of a nation. Hollywood Exiles from CBC podcasts and the BBC World Service.

*23:50.040- 23:55.620* :  Just in case the current punishments weren't enough, Russia is planning to introduce a new law,
*23:55.620- 24:00.360* :  which says that anyone who criticises the war in Ukraine can have their property seized.
*24:00.860- 24:05.820* :  Decenters already face possible prison sentences. Many have been jailed for even suggesting
*24:05.820- 24:10.300* :  that invading Ukraine might not have been the best idea the Kremlin has ever come up with.
*24:10.500- 24:16.440* :  But there's one group of critics, which the Russian authorities appear unsure how to deal with
*24:16.860- 24:22.280* :  the wives of mobilized Russian servicemen. Indeed, some are growing increasingly vocal in their
*24:22.280- 24:28.460* :  demand that their husbands be allowed to stop fighting and return home. Russia editor Steve Rosenberg
*24:28.460- 24:32.020* :  has been speaking to some of these women and hearing their stories.
*24:36.040- 24:43.200* :  In a room on the edge of Moscow, something unusual is happening. Raised voices and public criticism
*24:43.260- 24:50.880* :  of the Russian authorities. These women want their husbands back.
*24:51.560- 24:58.300* :  The men are among the 300,000 reservists mobilized by President Putin more than a year ago.
*24:58.720- 25:03.000* :  They's war in Ukraine. Maria Andreyeva is fed up waiting.
*25:05.420- 25:10.220* :  When will they decide that our husbands have discharged their military duty?
*25:10.620- 25:15.400* :  When they are brought back to us with no arms and legs, when they can't do anything because
*25:15.400- 25:20.920* :  they're just a vegetable. Or do we have to wait for them to be sent back in a zinc coffin?
*25:27.540- 25:30.600* :  Two weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*25:31.200- 25:37.120* :  Vladimir Putin told the Russian people no reservists would be needed for his special operation,
*25:37.660- 25:43.680* :  only professional soldiers. Half a year later, that changed. But in recent months,
*25:43.680- 25:49.200* :  some of the wives of the mobilized men have met via social media and together,
*25:49.800- 25:51.820* :  they're pressing for their husbands' return.
*25:54.960- 26:01.040* :  Once a week by the Kremlin Walls, after the changing of the guard, the women lay flowers
*26:01.040- 26:06.620* :  at the tomb of the unknown soldier. They have differing views on the Ukraine war.
*26:07.280- 26:13.460* :  Some say they support it. Others clearly don't. What unites them is the belief
*26:13.460- 26:17.100* :  that the draftees should no longer be part of it.
*26:17.940- 26:21.560* :  Antonina's partner was 44 when he was called up.
*26:23.460- 26:29.000* :  There are some people who want to fight, volunteer for it, and sign contracts. Let them fight.
*26:29.600- 26:33.960* :  But send us back our husbands who don't want to be there. They've done their duty to the
*26:33.960- 26:41.440* :  motherland, sent them home. No, say the authorities who portray the women as western studious.
*26:42.100- 26:45.940* :  The head of the Russian Parliament's Defense Committee has suggested that Russia's
*26:45.940- 26:53.180* :  enemies are behind these demands for demobilization. Can you imagine, he said, soldiers' wives in
*26:53.180- 26:59.800* :  World War II asking Stalin to send their husbands home after a year on the front line? It wouldn't
*26:59.800- 27:07.100* :  happen. But the Ukraine war is not the second World War. In World War II, Russia was invaded.
*27:07.940- 27:15.380* :  Today, it's invaded Ukraine. Maria Andreva says she fears a second wave of mobilization.
*27:18.540- 27:24.560* :  Some people act like ostriches. They stick their heads in the sand and try not to think about
*27:24.560- 27:30.820* :  what's happening. I can understand them. It's hard to accept that in your country, the state doesn't
*27:30.820- 27:36.640* :  need you to be happy. It just treats you as biological material. But if people want to survive,
*27:36.640- 27:41.260* :  sooner or later they need to recognize this and say that they do not agree.
*27:49.980- 27:55.280* :  At the weekend, Maria and some of the other wives visited one of Vladimir Putin's election
*27:55.300- 28:00.180* :  campaign offices in Moscow and got into a shouting match about the war.
*28:03.460- 28:08.940* :  Extraordinary. In a country where the authorities go out of their way to silence dissent,
*28:09.800- 28:15.140* :  should the Kremlin leader be worried by this very public display of discontent?
*28:16.240- 28:20.980* :  Well, listen to Antonina, previously a huge Putin fan.
*28:24.240- 28:29.780* :  This has changed my attitude to the authorities. I used to have enormous respect for Vladimir Putin.
*28:29.780- 28:35.360* :  Now I'm more neutral. I still find it hard to believe that he knows this kind of thing is happening.
*28:36.220- 28:40.460* :  But if he really does see us as traitors and outcasts for wanting our husbands back,
*28:41.100- 28:45.480* :  I don't understand why he'd have the attitude towards citizens who once voted for him.
*28:46.500- 28:50.940* :  Seeds of doubt the Kremlin will be hoping will not take root.
*28:51.340- 28:58.060* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. Researchers say results from Swedish trials of a new blood test to
*28:58.060- 29:03.080* :  detect Alzheimer's disease suggest it is as accurate as the painful and invasive
*29:03.080- 29:08.600* :  lumber punctures used currently. Experts say the test could revolutionise the early detection
*29:08.600- 29:14.140* :  of Alzheimer's, which accounts for the majority of dementia cases by becoming as routine as
*29:14.140- 29:20.560* :  the screening for high cholesterol is now. My colleague Justin Webb sought more details from Dr
*29:20.560- 29:27.780* :  Susan Kolhas from the Charity Alzheimer's Research UK. This work looked at over 700 people across
*29:27.780- 29:34.740* :  three different countries and what they showed is that this one blood biomarker called PETAL-217
*29:35.500- 29:40.660* :  was able to predict whether somebody had the proteins in the brain that are the whole
*29:40.660- 29:47.000* :  Markovolzheimer's disease with as much accuracy as current gold standard methods such as a
*29:47.000- 29:52.900* :  lumber puncture. And that's really important because for many years diagnosis for Alzheimer's
*29:52.900- 29:58.780* :  disease hasn't changed and we know that our current process isn't good enough. We have currently
*29:58.780- 30:04.800* :  two percent of people receiving an Alzheimer's diagnosis through this kind of gold standard method
*30:04.800- 30:10.360* :  of a lumber puncture or a PET scan. We don't have enough PET scanners in this country to diagnose
*30:10.360- 30:17.800* :  at the rate that we need to. Many people are waiting to for even longer many years to receive a
*30:17.800- 30:24.200* :  diagnosis. This is a really encouraging study. I think the next steps are working out whether this
*30:24.200- 30:31.520* :  results stands in populations that reflect the real world so people going into clinics with memory
*30:31.520- 30:37.560* :  concerns at an everyday level and making sure that these results still stand in those populations
*30:37.680- 30:43.900* :  and that's the work that's happening next. Yeah, so that means then that when people talk about it
*30:43.900- 30:49.280* :  being something that is available more broadly soon we are still talking what are we quite a few
*30:49.280- 30:55.420* :  years. We're probably talking between three and five years I think so we need to do those studies
*30:55.420- 31:01.020* :  and test whether these biomarkers work in real world populations and then they would need to go
*31:01.020- 31:07.180* :  through regulatory approval as well. But what's really important is that this is really urgent now
*31:07.180- 31:12.800* :  to sort because we can see the time or treatments are just coming around the corner that for the first
*31:12.800- 31:19.440* :  time slow progression of diseases like Alzheimer's disease and if people can get a diagnosis they
*31:19.440- 31:24.040* :  won't have access to those treatments. So it's really important that we sort this. Dr Susan
*31:24.040- 31:32.060* :  Cole has from Alzheimer's Research UK. The Canadian filmmaker Norman Dewison has died at the age of 97.
*31:32.060- 31:37.280* :  He was best known for directing the racially charged drama in the heat of the night made by the
*31:37.280- 31:43.240* :  Mirish Corporation Peter Goffin has this report. Made at the height of the civil rights movement
*31:43.300- 31:48.600* :  in the heat of the night starred Sydney Poitier as a black detective solving a murder in the Jim
*31:48.600- 31:54.700* :  Crow South. It was lesser who'd done it than a depiction of defiance and dignity in the face of
*32:02.540- 32:06.900* :  racism. In the heat of the night cemented Dewison's reputation as a director of films with a
*32:06.900- 32:13.960* :  statement to make even when Dewison made musicals they were provocative. With Jesus Christ superstar
*32:13.960- 32:21.260* :  a depiction of the Messiah as more human and less divine or in Fiddler on the Roof a family
*32:21.260- 32:28.100* :  drama in the shadow of a deadly program. Dewison retired in the early 2000s but not before returning
*32:28.100- 32:34.460* :  to familiar ground with the hurricane. The film is based on the true story of Ruben Carter a black
*32:34.460- 32:40.220* :  boxer sent to prison in the 1960s for a murder he didn't commit. I felt that the hurricane
*32:40.220- 32:45.720* :  had a great deal to say about America now the director once said 50 years into his career
*32:45.720- 32:52.060* :  so did Norman Dewison Peter Goffin. A Matador in Spain has become the country's first
*32:52.060- 32:59.200* :  bullfighter to publicly reveal that he is not heterosexual Mario Alcalde says he hopes coming out
*32:59.200- 33:06.000* :  does not attract a negative response from within the often conservative indeed macho world of
*33:06.000- 33:12.660* :  bullfighting. Guy Hedgeko is in Madrid and told me more about Mario Alcalde. He's a 31-year-old from
*33:13.240- 33:20.120* :  Madrid. He's not an extremely well-known bullfighter but he gave this interview to El Mundo which
*33:20.120- 33:25.600* :  is one of the country's best known newspapers at the weekend in which he he talked about his
*33:25.600- 33:33.840* :  sexuality. He identified as pansexual. He said I identified with the LGBTQ flag. I fall in love
*33:33.840- 33:40.980* :  with the interior of a person not their gender and he said that that obviously goes against the
*33:40.980- 33:45.960* :  sort of the the current in bullfighting which as you say there is known as a quite a conservative
*33:46.640- 33:54.540* :  world and he talked about this ambition he has to have us of bullfighting fan club set up in the
*33:55.260- 34:01.480* :  the barrio or the neighborhood of Treca in Madrid which is known as sort of the gay capital
*34:01.480- 34:08.480* :  of Spain and he said he wants gay people to be converted to bullfighting talked about that a lot
*34:08.600- 34:13.160* :  so he's an intriguing character and there has been a lot of interest in the fact that he has come
*34:13.160- 34:18.400* :  out this way. How has the news got down in the conservative world of bullfighting? Well we haven't
*34:18.400- 34:23.260* :  had a great deal of reaction yet I think that will come we're not in the middle of the bullfighting
*34:23.260- 34:30.100* :  season that might explain it but there has been some response for example Rafi Camino who's a veteran
*34:30.100- 34:36.340* :  Matador he said I offer you all my support my friend on social media he was very supportive
*34:36.980- 34:41.480* :  other people have spoken out not necessarily from within the bullfighting world but there's been a
*34:41.480- 34:48.720* :  political response a socialist politician Chema Crespo said that this showed extraordinary bravery
*34:49.280- 34:54.980* :  and he talked about the utterly machester world of bullfighting and how difficult it was for
*34:54.980- 35:01.900* :  someone to to make an announcement like this so far all over the response has been pretty positive
*35:01.900- 35:06.560* :  about this the big question now I think is whether this is the beginning of something whether we
*35:06.560- 35:12.100* :  will see other bullfight fighters start to come out of the closet as well Guy Hedgeco in Madrid
*35:14.880- 35:20.140* :  and that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast later
