*00:00.080- 00:03.880* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.800- 00:12.940* :  I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Tuesday 23 January, these are on main stories.
*00:13.020- 00:18.600* :  Southern Gaza residents say the city of Han Unis has seen one of its worst days of fighting
*00:19.100- 00:20.540* :  since Israel's offensive began.
*00:22.940- 00:25.160* :  I was in the university staying there in the evening.
*00:25.160- 00:28.680* :  Gunfire started shelling and air strikes from every direction.
*00:28.680- 00:32.940* :  I couldn't move with my nine children at all. I do not know where I should go.
*00:33.800- 00:37.860* :  The US and UK launched a fresh wave of strikes on hoothy rebels in Yemen
*00:37.860- 00:41.820* :  in response to their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. And?
*00:41.820- 00:47.640* :  There is soot under my fingernails. This is what is left of the cultural heritage of my people.
*00:47.640- 00:52.820* :  This is what we will never get back and our descendants will never touch this history.
*00:53.260- 00:57.020* :  A devastating fire in golfs almost all of the artworks in the breakaway
*00:57.020- 00:59.360* :  Republic of Abkhazia's National Gallery.
*01:02.320- 01:07.480* :  Also in this podcast, why Moscow's invasion of Ukraine is hampering efforts to predict climate
*01:07.480- 01:13.700* :  change, and ahead of this way's Oscar nominations, we hear who has been tipped for a Razi award
*01:14.160- 01:15.720* :  for the worst films in the last year.
*01:21.100- 01:26.200* :  Palestinians in Southern Gaza say Israel's bombardment is the most intense they've
*01:26.200- 01:32.500* :  experienced since the war began. Israeli forces expanded their offensive by entering the al-Masawi
*01:32.500- 01:39.140* :  district to the west of Khan Unis for the first time. Israeli tanks were also filmed just 200
*01:39.140- 01:44.600* :  metres away from the al-Qa'eh hospital in the area. A Gaza health ministry spokesman
*01:44.600- 01:51.180* :  said Israeli forces stormed it and arrested medical staff. A second hospital is also reported
*01:51.180- 01:57.960* :  to be under siege. The IDF hasn't commented. Muhammad Abdul Halib's family has been displaced
*01:57.960- 02:06.320* :  more than seven times. He says nowhere is safe. I was in the university staying there.
*02:06.740- 02:11.860* :  In the evening, gunfire started shelling and air strikes from every direction. I couldn't move
*02:11.860- 02:16.700* :  with my nine children at all. There was a building inside that we all entered and stayed in
*02:16.700- 02:21.420* :  until the morning. I left through the back door, and here I still don't know where I should go.
*02:21.980- 02:27.400* :  I do not know where I should go. Nebal Fasak is the Palestinian red crescent
*02:27.400- 02:33.180* :  spokesperson. She is based in Ramallah in the West Bank. Rebecca Kesby asked her if she'd
*02:33.180- 02:36.880* :  been able to get through to colleagues in Southern Gaza and what they were telling her.
*02:37.260- 02:43.360* :  Yes, we managed to communicate with our team in Khan Unis. The Palestinian Red Cross on
*02:43.400- 02:48.380* :  the extremely worried for the safety of our team working at Al-Amel Hospital and the Palestine
*02:48.380- 02:55.220* :  Red Cross and headquarters in Khan Unis. The area is under intense bombing. It makes a movement
*02:55.220- 03:01.820* :  almost impossible. Our staff volunteers, patients, the wounded and thousands of displaced people
*03:01.820- 03:08.720* :  who have been seeking shelter. No one can move and or go out. This includes our ambulance teams.
*03:08.780- 03:15.000* :  They cannot reach people who have been wounded and cannot rescue those in their situations
*03:15.000- 03:20.900* :  because of the constant bombardment. This happened early this morning. It was completely
*03:20.900- 03:28.040* :  besieged and anyone who's trying to move in the area was being targeted. However, later,
*03:28.040- 03:34.040* :  our teams managed to take one of the routes and they were able to evacuate a number of wounded
*03:34.040- 03:41.320* :  and those who have been killed during this intense bombardment and shilling. The situation is
*03:41.320- 03:47.940* :  extremely dire. Is it possible to know if any of your staff are among those who've been arrested
*03:47.980- 03:54.020* :  or what happened to those staff because we don't have very many details on that or why they were
*03:54.020- 04:01.620* :  arrested? None of our teams in Khan Unis were arrested. However, up to this moment, five of our
*04:01.620- 04:07.780* :  teams are still arrested. Up to this moment, they were arrested more than a month ago from
*04:07.780- 04:14.760* :  Jabalya Emergency Medical Center. We have already lost eight colleagues since the beginning of
*04:14.760- 04:21.380* :  the escalation. Eight have been killed. Yes, they ate. They were killed while they were on a duty
*04:21.380- 04:27.520* :  trying to evacuate the wounded people. Twenty-nine others were injured. Many of our ambulances,
*04:27.880- 04:34.120* :  at least 14, went out of service along with 19 others had several damages due to direct
*04:34.120- 04:41.220* :  attacks. On our ambulances, our hospital in Gaza City, at the hospital, went out of service.
*04:41.220- 04:47.880* :  And now we do have the same concern that an Amal hospital might also be directly targeted
*04:47.880- 04:55.140* :  and go out of service. Jabal Fasak speaking to Rebecca Kesby from Ramallah in the West Bank.
*04:56.520- 05:02.380* :  The U.S. has announced sanctions on an Iraqi airline, fly Baghdad, accusing it of giving assistance
*05:02.380- 05:08.380* :  to Iran's revolutionary guards and a run linked militant groups. Here's our Arab affairs editor,
*05:08.740- 05:13.620* :  Sebastian Usher. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused fly Baghdad of delivering weapons to
*05:13.620- 05:18.680* :  Damascus Airport for the use of the Quds Force before an arm of Iran's revolutionary guards
*05:19.200- 05:24.520* :  and Iran-aligned groups in Syria. The department also claims the low-cost airline has transported
*05:24.520- 05:30.380* :  Iraqi fighters in support of attacks by Iranian proxies on Israel. Since the war between Israel
*05:30.380- 05:35.640* :  and Hamas erupted in October, Iranian link groups have mounted multiple attacks on Israeli
*05:35.640- 05:41.260* :  and U.S. targets across the region. Fly Baghdad, which operates a fleet of eight passenger planes,
*05:41.260- 05:46.100* :  has denounced for sanctions, saying they're not based on any material or moral evidence.
*05:46.100- 05:53.320* :  Sebastian Usher officials in Washington say the U.S. and U.K. forces have carried out another
*05:53.320- 05:58.480* :  wave of strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. It's the latest action against the Iranian
*05:58.480- 06:03.400* :  back group, which has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea in response to
*06:03.400- 06:08.980* :  Israel's war against Hamas. Reports from Yemen say there have been big explosions in the capital
*06:08.980- 06:15.540* :  sauna, which is controlled by the Houthis. President Biden and the U.K. Prime Minister Rishisunak
*06:15.540- 06:21.200* :  have been discussing the conflict on the phone. The White House said they reiterated their commitment
*06:21.200- 06:26.740* :  to freedom of navigation and defending mariners from attack, and there will be much more on this
*06:26.740- 06:33.880* :  story in our later edition of the Global News Podcast. For the last 80 years or so,
*06:33.880- 06:40.260* :  leading nuclear scientists have set what's been called the Doomsday Clock to mark how close they
*06:40.260- 06:46.140* :  believe our planet is to global catastrophe, and Tuesday will see the update for 2024.
*06:46.300- 06:52.400* :  The BBC has been given exclusive access to the bulletin of atomic scientists in Chicago
*06:53.020- 06:58.500* :  to find out how they assess the risks. Today, technologies like AI and climate change
*06:58.500- 07:04.780* :  are included, but the greatest risk is nuclear war, as Jane Corbyn has been finding out.
*07:05.520- 07:09.280* :  North Korea has threatened to detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.
*07:09.280- 07:12.540* :  President Putin has ordered Russia's strategic nuclear forces.
*07:13.640- 07:17.400* :  Every year there's a meeting to assess the risk of global catastrophe,
*07:18.120- 07:25.180* :  and set the Doomsday Clock. It's a metaphor of how close we are to nuclear Armageddon,
*07:25.640- 07:30.360* :  a scary thought, but the scientists hope it will alert the public and pressure leaders to make
*07:30.360- 07:37.340* :  the world a safer place. In 2023, the hands were set at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest they've
*07:37.340- 07:44.540* :  ever been. In large part because of Russia's war in Ukraine. In Chicago, we've had exclusive access
*07:44.540- 07:50.840* :  to the bulletin of atomic scientists, meeting to discuss where to set the clock for this year.
*07:51.280- 07:57.980* :  I met its president, Rachel Bronson. This is a very dangerous time. We have moved from a period
*07:58.620- 08:05.400* :  where nuclear weapons were considered unusable and a nuclear war unwinnable. We're seeming to move
*08:05.400- 08:11.740* :  into a period of time where we're not so sure every major country, UK included, is investing
*08:11.740- 08:16.900* :  in their nuclear arsenal. But nevertheless, no nuclear weapon has been used for 78 to years.
*08:16.900- 08:20.800* :  People would say, isn't this scam hungry? There's no way we're moving towards that again.
*08:21.120- 08:25.560* :  And they'd be wrong. People would be wrong to say there's no way we're moving towards that again.
*08:27.600- 08:33.220* :  Here in Scotland, the UK's nuclear deterrent is on constant alert. The war heads are placed
*08:33.220- 08:38.460* :  on top of trident ballistic missiles, housed inside one of four vanguard submarines.
*08:39.160- 08:43.600* :  Nice to meet you, Fergol. Fergol Dalton was a lieutenant commander who served on HMS
*08:43.600- 08:50.760* :  victorious. We can see naval-based Clyde clearly from across the water. So how does Britain's
*08:50.760- 08:55.380* :  nuclear deterrent actually work? Well, there's four submarines and one of them is always deployed.
*08:55.380- 09:00.140* :  One's ready to take over. One's doing maintenance. One's maybe in refit. But there's always
*09:00.140- 09:06.660* :  one out there at 15 minutes notice to fire. There's a heck of a lot at stake. Yes, the whole point
*09:06.660- 09:11.080* :  of the nuclear deterrent is that it's never actually fired. People say, oh, you know, it's a weapon
*09:11.080- 09:15.040* :  system that would never be used. It's been used at the moment. The Vladimir Putin's of this world
*09:15.040- 09:19.440* :  know that it's out there and they know that it's credible and that we could use it if needs be.
*09:20.180- 09:26.260* :  In 2021, the UK government announced that it's increasing the cap on the number of its warheads.
*09:27.060- 09:31.040* :  There are continuing tensions, not only around British nuclear weapons.
*09:32.000- 09:37.100* :  Pentagon budget documents suggest that American ones may once again be based in Britain,
*09:37.740- 09:40.980* :  provoking protests at RAF Lake and East and Suffolk.
*09:42.620- 09:47.180* :  Sophie Bolte from the campaign for nuclear disarmament is one of the protesters.
*09:47.180- 09:53.080* :  The world is in a far more dangerous situation, precisely because of what's happening in Ukraine.
*09:53.620- 09:59.880* :  So we feel adding more nuclear bombs to that situation is not going to make it safer.
*10:00.740- 10:06.380* :  And that report was compiled by Jane Corbyn. Research is a warning that the loss of scientific
*10:06.380- 10:11.080* :  data from Russia's Arctic monitoring stations, following the invasion of Ukraine,
*10:11.820- 10:16.880* :  is having consequences for correctly predicting climate change, such as selector reports.
*10:17.580- 10:21.620* :  The Arctic holds glaciers, forests and carbon-rich frozen soils.
*10:22.040- 10:26.700* :  They're all at risk of irreversible change, which would reverberate across the planet.
*10:27.340- 10:31.460* :  Parts of the Arctic warm four times faster than the rest of the Earth.
*10:31.880- 10:34.420* :  So Arctic monitoring stations are critical.
*10:34.940- 10:40.420* :  Yet the flow of data stopped soon after Russia invaded Ukraine needed two years ago.
*10:41.040- 10:43.740* :  Russia represents almost half the Arctic landmass.
*10:43.740- 10:50.240* :  Without Russian data, researchers aren't able to monitor permafrost throwing shifts in biodiversity
*10:50.240- 10:52.640* :  or even greenhouse gas emissions.
*10:53.040- 11:00.140* :  It means crucial factors such as Siberia's vast Tyga forest will no longer be taken into account
*11:00.140- 11:06.640* :  in real time, only as a projection. The warning is contained in a study published in the journal
*11:07.080- 11:08.220* :  Nature Climate Change.
*11:09.020- 11:15.340* :  Such a selector. The UK Prime Minister Rishisunak's controversial plans to send some asylum
*11:15.340- 11:20.840* :  seekers to Rwanda suffered a setback on Monday when the upper chamber, the House of Lords,
*11:20.840- 11:27.120* :  voted to delay the treaty for the scheme. Our political correspondent Harry Varley has more details.
*11:28.100- 11:31.420* :  In order to understand what's happened, I think we need to just take a step back and remember
*11:31.820- 11:37.340* :  last year, the Supreme Court here in the UK, which is the top court, ruled that the government's
*11:37.340- 11:43.500* :  plan to send some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats to Rwanda was unlawful.
*11:43.500- 11:47.460* :  And they said that because they thought that Rwanda was not safe.
*11:48.280- 11:52.800* :  And in response to that, the government signed a treaty with Rwanda that added legal
*11:52.800- 11:57.500* :  weight to a number of new measures that aimed to demonstrate that Rwanda was safe.
*11:57.500- 12:02.540* :  And what the House of Lords have done here is say ratifying that treaty that was signed between
*12:02.540- 12:07.580* :  the UK and Rwanda should be delayed until all the measures within it are actually in place.
*12:07.580- 12:12.960* :  At the moment, it's saying that Rwanda will do X or Y, which includes things like establishing
*12:12.960- 12:17.460* :  a monitoring committee to ensure complaints can be heard or ensuring that international judges
*12:17.460- 12:23.040* :  are trained in Rwanda and law. And what the House of Lords have said it has done is call on the
*12:23.040- 12:27.920* :  government to delay ratifying the treaty until the measures in it are actually in place.
*12:28.460- 12:30.100* :  And could the government just ignore this?
*12:30.360- 12:34.960* :  Yes, essentially they can. This is advisory motion from the House of Lords.
*12:35.440- 12:38.980* :  Remember, that is the unelected chamber in the British constitution.
*12:39.380- 12:42.600* :  And so what the government can do, they will hear what the House of Lords have said,
*12:42.600- 12:46.500* :  but they can ultimately just set out their reasons for why they disagree.
*12:46.900- 12:50.800* :  And that will be the end of it. It is an advisory motion that is not binding on the government.
*12:51.360- 12:54.620* :  Does it give an indication of the feeling maybe in the country as a whole
*12:54.620- 12:57.380* :  about sending asylum seekers to Rwanda?
*12:57.640- 12:59.700* :  It certainly gives an idea as to the feeling in the House of Lords.
*12:59.700- 13:04.900* :  And if you remember, the full Rwanda bill that sort of is paired up with this treaty,
*13:05.260- 13:09.740* :  that bill is going to start being debated next week in the House of Lords.
*13:09.740- 13:14.800* :  And what it gives us is an indication of the level of opposition that that bill is likely to face.
*13:14.800- 13:19.740* :  And remember, of course, in the UK, there's going to be a general election at some point this year.
*13:20.200- 13:23.000* :  And for Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, he will be concerned that if
*13:23.260- 13:27.400* :  Piers and the House of Lords delay this bill, then it puts a serious obstacle
*13:27.400- 13:32.580* :  to his plan to getting flights to Rwanda off the ground before an election later this year.
*13:52.700- 13:55.720* :  Rishi Sunak's new dystopian sci-fi film, The Kitchen,
*13:56.300- 13:58.400* :  set on a housing estate in London.
*14:06.860- 14:12.660* :  A BBC investigation has found evidence that the United Arab Emirates hired American mercenaries
*14:12.660- 14:17.080* :  to train Emirati officers to assassinate political enemies in Yemen.
*14:17.880- 14:20.500* :  It's triggered a wave of killings that continue today,
*14:21.180- 14:25.740* :  and demonstrates the complex role that foreign powers are having in Yemen's civil war.
*14:26.400- 14:28.760* :  Former US servicemen who work for the company,
*14:28.760- 14:34.120* :  spear group operations have spoken to our reporter, Noelle Almagafi.
*14:34.720- 14:38.940* :  In 2015, fighting in Yemen's civil war was on several fronts.
*14:38.940- 14:44.380* :  The Iran-backed Houthis had taken over the capital Sanaa and Al-Qaeda were gaining territory
*14:44.380- 14:49.760* :  in the South. To tackle the rise in extremist groups, the United Arab Emirates in effect
*14:49.760- 14:53.840* :  took charge of security in southern Yemen, with the backing of the US.
*14:54.700- 14:58.960* :  The BBC has seen evidence that between 2015 and 2020,
*14:58.960- 15:02.600* :  the UAE paid a private company, spear operations group,
*15:02.600- 15:07.960* :  to carry out targeted killings in Yemen and to train Emiratis to carry out similar operations.
*15:08.060- 15:13.180* :  But our investigation has found some of those targeted with social and political activists.
*15:14.060- 15:17.000* :  But Ashayban, from the human rights organization Reprieve,
*15:17.340- 15:19.940* :  has been investigating assassinations in southern Yemen.
*15:20.880- 15:27.920* :  It was not until 2018 when we started to pinpoint that actually this is part of a systematic
*15:27.920- 15:33.800* :  targeting policy. You have this chaotic situation where everyone can name anyone a terrorist
*15:33.800- 15:39.380* :  and start going after them. These are extraordinary killings, and the most important thing is that
*15:39.380- 15:45.480* :  it's still happening until today. In a statement, the UAE says the allegations against them are false.
*15:45.480- 15:51.240* :  The BBC also approached this big group's founder, Abraham Gohlan, but he didn't respond.
*15:51.240- 15:55.320* :  The US State Department and Department of Defense declined to comment.
*15:55.320- 16:00.460* :  A CIA spokesman said the idea it signed off on such activity was false.
*16:01.140- 16:07.000* :  Noelle Almagafi. Pope Francis has called for the release of eight people, including six
*16:07.000- 16:13.220* :  nuns who were kidnapped on a bus in Haiti on Friday. Kidnappings are on the rise amid widespread
*16:13.220- 16:19.460* :  gang violence in the Caribbean country, whose political, economic and health systems are in ruins.
*16:20.420- 16:25.400* :  At the end of his weekly prayer at the Vatican on Sunday, the Pope said he prayed for social
*16:25.400- 16:29.520* :  harmony in the nation and called on all parties to end the violence.
*16:31.960- 16:37.520* :  I heard with sorrow the news of the kidnapping in Haiti of a group of people including sex
*16:37.540- 16:44.780* :  nuns. As I plead for their release, I pray for social harmony in the country and call on everyone
*16:44.780- 16:50.520* :  to stop the violence that causes so much suffering to that dear people.
*16:51.380- 16:56.100* :  Gangs are now estimated to control up to 80 percent of the capital, Porto Prandt's,
*16:56.580- 17:03.240* :  and are suspected of killing 4,000 people and kidnapping another 3,000 in just the last year.
*17:03.820- 17:08.720* :  Noelle Almagafi spoke to Bishop Pierre Andre Dumas of Onsay Avore in Haiti.
*17:09.340- 17:15.680* :  The gangs want to create a situation of panic in the country and then you know the church,
*17:15.680- 17:21.180* :  we try to take care of the people because people need food, there is a humanitarian crisis in the
*17:21.180- 17:27.820* :  country. So the system is a sign also there is no respect for anyone, consecrated people,
*17:27.820- 17:33.680* :  they gave their life and to take care of their children and now there are victims of kidnapping.
*17:33.680- 17:40.400* :  We know that the kidnappers they contact some people from the family and they act a lot of money
*17:40.400- 17:45.980* :  that the church cannot have, the congregation doesn't have this money. There is no price
*17:45.980- 17:50.740* :  about human being because human being is so precious for God, it's so precious for humanity,
*17:50.740- 17:57.120* :  you cannot destroy human being, it's an equation of money, it's a question of to respect life
*17:57.120- 18:02.700* :  for people who respect the dignity of the people. Do you have any idea of who the kidnappers might be?
*18:03.200- 18:08.220* :  We don't know exactly who did that, but there is a lot of confusion in the country and people
*18:08.220- 18:12.860* :  want to make some evolution at the same time, there is a lot of violence in the country,
*18:12.860- 18:19.860* :  20 people died last week and other people also has been wounded. So it's a very complicated
*18:19.860- 18:25.980* :  situation I think we have to put an end to this violent situation and to act the leaders of the
*18:25.980- 18:30.160* :  country to be conscious about what happened and they have to take some serious decisions.
*18:30.680- 18:37.300* :  I believe I saw you say that you would offer yourself to swap your place with that of the
*18:37.300- 18:46.000* :  nuns, have I read that correctly? Yes and this is because for me, six women, they give their life to
*18:46.000- 18:54.040* :  God, you can imagine all the sacrifices they are making every day in life and then now some people
*18:54.040- 19:00.000* :  they decided to keep them. So there are women, I cannot accept and I prefer to offer myself,
*19:00.000- 19:07.040* :  it's not a show if they see that and as church, we can also not only talk, we can also give some
*19:07.040- 19:16.160* :  signs because myself a 61 man and religious leader and then I can do what I can, it's not a show
*19:16.460- 19:21.540* :  to say that I'm very sure if they accept, I will give them, they prove that the
*19:21.820- 19:27.020* :  women can come back to their families and their communities. Bishop Pierre Andre Duma.
*19:27.840- 19:34.340* :  Now to Spain, online romance scams are all too frequent as are there accompanying requests for money.
*19:34.980- 19:40.460* :  In a small town near the capital Madrid, it appears to sisters were seduced by such a scam,
*19:41.060- 19:45.480* :  which is led to a series of tragic events ending in the deaths of three people.
*19:46.180- 19:50.340* :  Police have arrested a man who had been renting a room in their property.
*19:51.080- 19:53.720* :  Our Madrid correspondent Guy Hegeco told me more.
*19:54.200- 20:00.960* :  The victims were three siblings, Amelia, Ankelis and Pepe, Gutierrez Ayuso in their late 60s and
*20:00.960- 20:07.020* :  early 70s who lived in the same house in this small town which is just outside Madrid.
*20:08.000- 20:13.980* :  These two sisters had fallen prey to this scam over the last few years whereby they believed
*20:14.140- 20:21.340* :  that they were in a long distance relationship with they thought to U.S. former military
*20:21.340- 20:28.740* :  servicemen who were supposedly in the United States and they were sending money in large quantities
*20:29.360- 20:34.040* :  and that we're told is despite the fact that local people in the town were telling them that they
*20:34.040- 20:39.020* :  believe this was a scam. However, Amelia and Ankelis seemed to believe that it was a genuine
*20:39.020- 20:42.480* :  relationship and how did the suspect get involved with them?
*20:42.800- 20:50.220* :  The suspect, this 43-year-old Pakistani man, had rented out a room in the home of the siblings
*20:50.220- 20:54.360* :  for several months and this seems to be partly because they needed the money.
*20:54.360- 21:01.360* :  But also when he was living with them, he was told police that they borrowed money from him
*21:01.740- 21:05.660* :  in order to send that money on to these apparent scammers.
*21:06.000- 21:12.780* :  The suspect claims that he lent them around 50,000 euros and that would be around 55,000 dollars
*21:13.140- 21:18.200* :  and that they did not pay him the money back. There is another link in that he had already
*21:18.200- 21:24.180* :  been convicted of assaulting one of the sisters last year with a hammer and he spent seven
*21:24.180- 21:28.140* :  months in prison. He got out of prison slightly earlier than the sentence, it was a two-year sentence.
*21:28.140- 21:32.600* :  And it's such a tragic tale and has there been any talk that the police possibly should have
*21:32.760- 21:35.020* :  done something to try and prevent him going near the siblings?
*21:35.020- 21:41.060* :  There was a restraining order on him as well but it seems as if that restraining order was dropped
*21:41.060- 21:46.460* :  or was not enforced that the issues surrounding his early release are being looked at and I think
*21:46.460- 21:50.880* :  the way that the police handled this is coming under scrutiny. Guy Hedgeko.
*21:51.940- 21:58.280* :  The authorities and the Georgian breakaway republic of Abkhazia say some 4,000 works of art
*21:58.680- 22:04.580* :  which had taken more than 60 years to collect weren't up in flames in a fire which has devastated
*22:04.580- 22:10.120* :  its national art gallery. From the Georgian capital to Bliisi our correspondent Rayhanda
*22:10.120- 22:11.300* :  Mietri has more details.
*22:15.440- 22:20.460* :  A video on social media showed intense flames inside the national art gallery.
*22:20.460- 22:25.640* :  Investigators say an electrical short circuit may have started the fire yesterday.
*22:25.660- 22:31.700* :  It spread quickly through the wooden building. The paintings destroyed included 300 works
*22:31.700- 22:38.280* :  by the renowned artist and stage designer Aleksander Chervashitsa. The National Gallery's director
*22:38.280- 22:43.060* :  Suram Sakhania said it was an irreparable loss for Abkhaz culture.
*22:47.020- 22:52.380* :  We've been gathering this collection since 1963 and it went up in flames in seconds.
*22:53.140- 22:55.620* :  Such a tragedy for us here in Abkhazia.
*22:56.640- 23:01.520* :  The art had survived Abkhazia's civil war with Georgia in the 1990s.
*23:01.880- 23:06.800* :  Local artists had long been demanding a most suitable location to store the collection.
*23:07.380- 23:13.200* :  A video taken before the fire showed paintings stacked together in two cramped rooms without
*23:13.200- 23:18.760* :  adequate protection. Russia, which supports Abkhazia militarily and financially,
*23:18.860- 23:25.000* :  has promised to send specialists to Sukhumi to help restore the 150 paintings
*23:25.000- 23:26.720* :  rescued from the flames.
*23:27.460- 23:28.380* :  Rayhanda Mietri
*23:28.860- 23:34.040* :  Set in an endangered social housing community in a near futuristic dystopian London,
*23:34.040- 23:40.660* :  the kitchen has just been released on Netflix, co-directed by the British Oscar-winning actor Daniel
*23:40.660- 23:47.420* :  Kaluya and Kiberator Arez. It reflects on class, gentrification and a future dominated by
*23:47.660- 23:51.640* :  grotesque housing inequality exacerbated by private developers.
*23:52.380- 23:57.480* :  The film follows the story of Izzy played by Kane Williamson, who is trying to leave the area.
*23:58.120- 24:03.660* :  But he meets Benji, the orphan son of his ex-girlfriend, and slowly steps up to take care of him.
*24:04.240- 24:08.980* :  As the people of the kitchen fight back against the authorities' failure to provide essential services
*24:09.640- 24:12.760* :  and the police who carry out armed raids and drone surveillance,
*24:13.380- 24:16.580* :  Izzy is forced to choose between himself and the community.
*24:19.380- 24:23.800* :  Good morning, it's the little kitchen, live and tiring.
*24:26.360- 24:27.300* :  I'm getting out of this place.
*24:27.740- 24:28.400* :  This is all I hope.
*24:28.840- 24:29.420* :  Save it myself.
*24:34.240- 24:34.780* :  So where do you live?
*24:35.400- 24:35.680* :  Kitchen.
*24:36.780- 24:37.140* :  My mom.
*24:37.960- 24:38.400* :  She said,
*24:40.080- 24:40.860* :  he never loved her.
*24:46.240- 24:47.420* :  Who do you love me?
*24:51.060- 24:54.300* :  The kitchen is a project that's been in the making for a decade,
*24:54.300- 24:58.500* :  as the co-director Kiberator Arez explained to Amal Rajan.
*24:58.960- 25:02.320* :  Yeah, we just wanted to make something. So essentially those three of us, as me,
*25:02.320- 25:06.800* :  Dan Kaluya and Dan Emerson, the producer, we put in a few hundred pounds each to do a workshop
*25:06.800- 25:10.540* :  in a day. Dan, you had an outline, and then we just worked together with a bunch of different actors,
*25:11.240- 25:13.920* :  few of Daniel's friends to kind of start to build out the idea.
*25:13.920- 25:17.980* :  And then from then, we then moved into the more formal scripting process.
*25:18.460- 25:20.520* :  That's been incredibly satisfying seeing it on Netflix.
*25:21.100- 25:25.440* :  When it is a dystopian commentary, what is it about life today and some of these housing
*25:25.440- 25:28.400* :  estates that you were trying to capture and satirize or comment on?
*25:28.600- 25:31.160* :  People talk a lot about the idea of people getting pushed out, right?
*25:31.240- 25:33.000* :  And then as you start to break that down, you'll be like,
*25:33.000- 25:36.300* :  if you keep getting pushed out, further and further, what does that mean?
*25:36.300- 25:38.560* :  And then actually what happens if you push that to the limits?
*25:39.220- 25:43.860* :  And there's one community in one place that's just saying no and who's remaining to stay.
*25:44.160- 25:48.480* :  So yeah, it was really just a idea of where home is, what it means to sort of lose your home,
*25:48.480- 25:52.200* :  what it means to always be sort of moved around or never have some sort of surrounding.
*25:52.820- 25:56.420* :  That's a massive issue for huge numbers of communities in this country right now,
*25:56.420- 26:00.100* :  is it with social housing. Huge numbers of people are concerned about.
*26:00.360- 26:04.020* :  And it's a particular issue in social housing where a lot of people feel frankly forgotten
*26:04.260- 26:06.460* :  by the state. Don't they feel forgotten by programs like this?
*26:06.460- 26:08.700* :  They feel forgotten by kind of the public at large.
*26:09.020- 26:12.000* :  Yeah, for sure. For me, I think there's people feel overlooked.
*26:12.000- 26:15.800* :  I feel like London is so much money in and around London.
*26:15.800- 26:21.980* :  But then day to day, I don't think people feel how their space is all sort of like the values sometimes.
*26:22.540- 26:25.160* :  You're right. The footballer is in it. He makes his acting debut.
*26:25.160- 26:26.720* :  A lot of critics have been very nice about it.
*26:27.080- 26:29.440* :  He plays a DJ called Lord Kitchener.
*26:29.800- 26:32.740* :  Yeah, Lord Kitchener. So we based him, the name really changed.
*26:32.740- 26:34.580* :  The legendary calypso that he took with the whole thing in the game.
*26:34.580- 26:37.420* :  And the Windrush in the late 40s.
*26:37.580- 26:40.820* :  That gave him the name and that just really naturally tied into the place we
*26:40.820- 26:44.980* :  called the kitchen. And then he really wanted to find the voice of the kitchen.
*26:45.220- 26:47.900* :  We wanted someone that sort of like really grounded everyone and really sort of set
*26:47.900- 26:51.740* :  of everyone and we looked into his history and his past going up his half-London,
*26:51.740- 26:55.560* :  his fellow south-London, and then really just felt that he was the right person.
*26:56.100- 26:58.900* :  Kibwe Tavara is speaking to Amal Rajan.
*26:59.880- 27:04.980* :  And staying with Phil, the nominations are out for the Golden Raspberry Awards or Razzees,
*27:05.480- 27:10.040* :  which for more than 40 years have been highlighting the biggest film flops of the year.

*27:14.960- 27:17.780* :  And leading the way is the fourth expendables film,

*27:22.740- 27:25.420* :  Here's our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
*27:26.580- 27:27.660* :  Let's fly, baby!
*27:27.800- 27:31.800* :  With an all-star cast including Jason Statham and Sylvester Stallone,

*27:36.520- 27:40.240* :  including Worst Picture, where it's up against a horror film,
*27:40.240- 27:42.500* :  Winnie the Pooh, Blood and Honey.
*27:42.680- 27:46.140* :  Who piglet, Eeyore, we were friends for many years.
*27:46.260- 27:52.000* :  There is also a Worst Actress nomination for Dame Helen Mirren in Shazam, Fury of the Gods.
*27:52.340- 27:54.800* :  I feel good about this. Me too.

*27:58.980- 28:01.420* :  You lay the problem with me, you talk to my boss.
