*01:28.880- 01:32.040* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday,
*01:32.040- 01:37.140* :  the 31st of January. Satellite data reveals that more than half the buildings in Gaza have
*01:37.140- 01:42.620* :  been damaged or destroyed in Israel's war with Hamas. But what are the chances of a cease-fire there?
*01:44.160- 01:48.660* :  We will not withdraw the Israel Defence Forces from the Gaza Strip and we will not release
*01:48.860- 01:54.100* :  thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. Meanwhile, Israel's confirmed it is pumping
*01:54.100- 02:00.080* :  seawater into tunnels in Gaza. The fragile governing coalition in Spain has suffered a setback

*02:16.580- 02:24.200* :  given to its leader Imran Khan. And let us take you with us to Solaris, planet of mystery.
*02:25.000- 02:28.620* :  Looking back at a century of Russia's main film studio, Mosfilm.
*02:33.960- 02:38.220* :  The United Nations Security Council has expressed concern about what it calls the
*02:38.220- 02:44.340* :  Dyer and rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. It followed a closed or
*02:44.340- 02:48.340* :  briefing from the new humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for the territory.
*02:49.260- 02:54.080* :  New analysis of satellite imagery has revealed the full extent of the destruction there,
*02:54.080- 02:58.220* :  showing that more than half the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.
*02:58.220- 03:02.800* :  In Israel's military offensive, which followed the Hamas massacre of the 7th of October,
*03:03.500- 03:04.880* :  Caroline Hawley has the details.
*03:05.520- 03:09.900* :  Aid agencies have repeatedly warned of the scale of suffering and destruction in Gaza.
*03:10.500- 03:15.600* :  Now new satellite imagery reveals the true extent of it, with whole residential neighborhoods in
*03:15.600- 03:23.060* :  ruins, once bustling streets, now silent. The analysis estimates that between 50 to 61 percent of
*03:23.060- 03:29.320* :  all buildings in the Gaza Strip have been badly damaged or destroyed. This includes 38,000
*03:29.320- 03:34.680* :  buildings in the southern city of Hamunis alone. Corey Shere of City University of New York
*03:34.680- 03:37.500* :  has analysed images from a range of war zones.
*03:38.020- 03:44.020* :  The extent and pace of damage is remarkable. I've never seen satellite radar indicated
*03:44.020- 03:47.480* :  damage appear so quickly, and in that sense it really stands out.
*03:47.720- 03:53.120* :  And it's not just buildings. BBC verify his examined images which show large areas of farmland
*03:53.120- 03:58.620* :  in the north and centre of Gaza, laid waste. The idea of says Hamas tunnel entrances and
*03:58.620- 04:03.480* :  rocket launch sites had been found in some agricultural areas, and it's repeatedly accused
*04:03.500- 04:09.200* :  of embedding itself in built-up areas. But there have been allegations of deliberate destruction,
*04:09.680- 04:14.220* :  including of a university blown up earlier this month, in what appears to have been a controlled
*04:14.220- 04:21.260* :  explosion after it had been used by Israel as a military base. The UN says 85 percent of Gaza's
*04:21.260- 04:26.380* :  population has now been displaced by the war. Many people are now camped out close to the Egyptian
*04:26.380- 04:32.160* :  border. Seen from the air, the site covers about three and a half square kilometres. A sprawling
*04:32.160- 04:38.720* :  tent city of hunger and despair. Caroline Hawley. But even amid the death and destruction in
*04:38.720- 04:44.100* :  Gaza, there has been a glimmer of hope in recent days that a new ceasefire deal could be agreed.
*04:44.900- 04:49.220* :  On Tuesday, the White House National Security spokesman spoke of the potential for an extended
*04:49.220- 04:55.020* :  pause that would allow more Israeli hostages to be freed. Hamas says it is looking at the
*04:55.020- 04:59.480* :  proposals. But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still talking tough.
*04:59.940- 05:05.740* :  We will not withdraw the Israel Defense Forces from the Gaza Strip, and we will not release
*05:05.740- 05:12.300* :  thousands of terrorists. What will happen? Total victory. Absolute victory. No less than that.
*05:12.720- 05:17.360* :  We're given those comments. I asked our Middle East analyst Sebastian Asha if a deal is really
*05:17.360- 05:22.820* :  getting closer. And if so, what it might look like. What Netanyahu has said is no different
*05:22.820- 05:26.980* :  for what he's been saying throughout. This was a speech saying that his government is committed
*05:26.980- 05:31.460* :  to absolute victory, which is essentially been as mantra since day one, which means total
*05:31.460- 05:36.660* :  elimination of Hamas. That's politically and militarily, whether that means now of a
*05:36.660- 05:41.400* :  complete elimination of Hamas fighters. I mean, that's something which obviously is very unlikely
*05:41.400- 05:46.980* :  to be accomplished and would take months more of a kind of intensity of bombardment that we've
*05:46.980- 05:52.740* :  seen in Gaza. In terms of the deal, what we've heard about that from various sources is this would
*05:52.740- 05:57.320* :  be a considerably longer pause in the fighting than the previous one, which last a week. This would
*05:57.320- 06:03.040* :  be potentially at least a month or up to six weeks. And it would be a stage release of hostages.
*06:03.640- 06:09.060* :  Perhaps 35 women, children and the elderly in the first batch, and with that hundreds of
*06:09.060- 06:13.040* :  Palestinian prisoners, and then that would build up as confidence built up. This publicly
*06:13.040- 06:18.160* :  state of positions, as we heard there from Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas as well, are essentially
*06:18.160- 06:23.140* :  still totally at odds. What Netanyahu says is it's not going to be a complete withdrawal of the
*06:23.140- 06:27.520* :  troops, and we're not going to release thousands of Palestinian prisoners. What Hamas has said
*06:27.520- 06:32.360* :  has been an order to negotiate. We need a commitment to a total withdrawal, and their bargaining
*06:32.360- 06:37.020* :  chips the hostages are in order to get released that number of prisoners.
*06:37.340- 06:42.420* :  Now Israel wants to eliminate Hamas. One of the ways it's doing that is to try to get rid of
*06:42.420- 06:47.360* :  its tunnels. And today we learned that it's now flooding those tunnels with sea water. What's
*06:47.360- 06:52.160* :  the significance of that? Well, this is confirmation from the idea. If we had reports several weeks
*06:52.160- 06:55.420* :  ago that they were starting to do this, and this was controversial for a number of reasons.
*06:55.520- 06:59.480* :  One of which, from the perspective of hostages and their families, was that it's believed that
*06:59.480- 07:03.560* :  many of our sources are down in the tunnels, and that it could be another danger to their lives
*07:03.560- 07:09.060* :  and top of the bombardment, the shooting, Hamas treatment, medical illness, all of that. But also
*07:09.060- 07:13.140* :  environmentally, that this is sea water that is being put into the tunnels, and that could
*07:13.140- 07:19.500* :  contaminate the groundwater in guards in already an appalling situation. But Israel saying that
*07:19.500- 07:23.280* :  this is just some tunnels, and just one of the tools they're using against the network.
*07:23.780- 07:29.780* :  Sebastian Usher, our mid-least analyst. President Biden has said he's decided how the U.S.
*07:29.780- 07:35.060* :  will respond to the drone strike in Jordan on Sunday that killed three American service personnel,
*07:35.060- 07:40.000* :  an injured almost three dozen more. Speaking as he left the White House for an election campaign
*07:40.300- 07:46.380* :  Mr. Biden told reporters that he held Iran responsible for the attack, saying it had supplied
*07:46.380- 07:51.660* :  the weapons used. Tehran has denied involvement. From Washington, here's Gary O'Donney.
*07:52.220- 07:56.440* :  Joe Biden was giving little away about the specifics of the decision he's taken,
*07:56.440- 08:01.860* :  but it's clear that a course of action has been settled on after consultations with military
*08:01.860- 08:07.560* :  and intelligence chiefs. He's come under pressure from some Republicans to hit Iranian targets
*08:08.300- 08:13.460* :  directly, but his administration is desperately trying to avoid a wider war in the mid-least.
*08:13.460- 08:18.440* :  That's not what I'm looking for. He told reporters. Separately, the spokesman for the National
*08:18.440- 08:23.400* :  Security Council, John Kirby, said that while the U.S. would not telegraph its punches,
*08:23.400- 08:29.080* :  it was possible there would be a tiered approach with multiple actions over time,
*08:29.180- 08:34.680* :  aimed at degrading the capabilities the groups have to launch attacks.
*08:35.000- 08:40.060* :  Gary O'Donney, in Washington. We're following that attack on U.S. troops in Jordan.
*08:40.060- 08:46.600* :  The latest edition of the Global Story podcast is looking at Iran's strategy in the middle
*08:46.600- 08:51.340* :  east, and you can find that in the usual places where you search for your BBC podcasts.
*08:51.340- 08:57.640* :  And while we're talking podcasts, we are planning to do a special edition of the Global News podcast
*08:57.640- 09:02.940* :  to coincide with the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February.
*09:02.940- 09:08.280* :  We'll be joining forces with our friends at Ukraine Cast to answer any questions you may have
*09:08.280- 09:13.320* :  about where the war goes from here. Please email us if there's anything you'd like to know,
*09:13.320- 09:17.400* :  and if possible, record a voice note so we can play it in that podcast.
*09:17.400- 09:25.040* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk or you can tweet us on X at Global NewsPod.
*09:26.160- 09:31.240* :  Back to Iran now, and for decades, there's been simmering tension between the government
*09:31.240- 09:35.860* :  and Kurdish groups in the west of the country. On Monday, the Iranian authorities
*09:35.860- 09:41.560* :  hanged four Kurdish activists arrested more than a year ago accused of collaborating with Israel.
*09:42.280- 09:48.320* :  A day later, much of the Kurdish region came to a standstill as a result of a general strike as
*09:48.320- 09:57.260* :  people protested against the killings. People chanting outside the house of one of those who
*09:57.260- 10:02.660* :  was hanged, human rights groups have condemned the executions which took place at a prison outside
*10:02.660- 10:09.180* :  Tehran. I heard more about the Kurdish anger from the bbc Persian service correspondent Geogol.
*10:09.560- 10:15.640* :  This execution of these four young men outrage many in Kurdish region which is the beacon of
*10:15.640- 10:21.000* :  protest against Islamic Republic of Iran. I have been in contact with some of the family members
*10:21.000- 10:25.460* :  of those people who have been executed. Their buddies have been still possessed by the government
*10:25.460- 10:31.200* :  and they have told the family they will bury them in an unknown location. When a Kurdish political
*10:31.200- 10:37.360* :  party and a few small parties call for a strike, many including me were surprised. By the extent
*10:37.360- 10:43.440* :  of the protest, also some of the major Kurdish city in north west of Iran entirely shut down.
*10:43.860- 10:49.940* :  And I think it shows how much people are angry with the government. I could see thousands of people
*10:50.220- 10:56.540* :  wearing symbols of a Kurdish fighters in the mountain walking toward the house of those people
*10:56.540- 11:02.460* :  who have been executed. Defiantly, it shows people are not afraid anymore after regime.
*11:02.780- 11:09.020* :  The Iranian authorities say these four executed men were convicted of collaborating with
*11:09.020- 11:14.920* :  Israel. Are there links between Kurds and Israel? And what do you make of those accusations in
*11:14.920- 11:20.740* :  this case? Well, I am sure there are some sympathies between two nations. The enemy of my enemy
*11:20.740- 11:27.460* :  is my friend. In the past, before the revolution, 1979, there was a collaboration until 1975
*11:27.460- 11:34.640* :  between Iranian intelligence service and Musad by training Iranian Kurds to fight against Saddam Hussein.
*11:34.640- 11:41.680* :  But now, we don't have any tangible evidence to prove the Kurds in Iran are helping Israeli
*11:41.680- 11:46.900* :  intelligence service Musad to carry out assassination or sabotage in Iran.
*11:47.080- 11:50.720* :  So what do you think is the real reason that these men have been executed?
*11:50.720- 11:54.280* :  If you look at what is happening in Syria in the past few months,
*11:54.300- 12:00.840* :  numbers of high-ranking Revolutionary Guards' puts force commanders have been killed by drone
*12:00.840- 12:06.040* :  attack or air strike by Israelis. So there is a lot of pressure for Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
*12:06.040- 12:10.520* :  They project themselves as a power. At this point of time, I believe Iranian government
*12:10.520- 12:14.120* :  want to send message. We are decisive, and we are powerful.
*12:14.120- 12:19.240* :  Jihad goal of the BBC Persian Service. The party of the former Pakistani Prime Minister
*12:19.240- 12:23.540* :  Imran Khan has condemned the 10-year prison sentence he was given on Tuesday.
*12:24.220- 12:28.480* :  The cricket had turned politician was found guilty of leaking classified documents when he was in
*12:28.480- 12:34.380* :  power. Mr. Khan is already in jail for not declaring details of gifts he received while in office.
*12:34.380- 12:39.920* :  He has denied the charges and will appeal. The sentence came less than two weeks before a general
*12:39.920- 12:45.960* :  election in which Mr. Khan is barred from standing. In a message on social media, he urged supporters
*12:45.960- 12:52.360* :  to come out in large numbers to vote for his party. A close aide, Zulfi Bukhari, told the BBC
*12:52.360- 12:57.440* :  the sentence would only boost Mr. Khan's electoral appeal. The people of Pakistan are standing with
*12:57.440- 13:02.760* :  him and they can't seem to subdued his popularity. Even today's decision is only going to make the
*13:02.760- 13:06.940* :  people come out in higher numbers on February 8th election day.
*13:07.360- 13:13.240* :  Owen Bennett Jones is the former BBC Pakistan correspondent. He told Nulam Agavan more about this
*13:13.240- 13:18.180* :  charismatic politician. He's been the famous famous man in Pakistan since he was about 20 years old,
*13:18.180- 13:23.740* :  and he's 71 now. He was a cricketing hero and has remained in the public eye ever since the
*13:23.740- 13:29.620* :  charismatic man is still highly popular and has a lot of support in the country. After years of
*13:29.620- 13:34.060* :  campaigning, having left his cricketing career behind him and went into politics, took him decades
*13:34.060- 13:38.920* :  to do it, but he did it, but he did it with army support. Then they fell out, the army and
*13:38.920- 13:44.120* :  Imran and now he's in jail and they are controlling the situation from CHQ.
*13:44.300- 13:50.580* :  So let's talk a little bit more about the military's influence on politics in Pakistan. You talk
*13:50.580- 13:54.880* :  about the clash, I suppose, between Mr. Khan and the military in short order there.
*13:55.340- 14:00.040* :  Yes, sure. All legal cases like this with the top politicians are basically designed to manipulate
*14:00.040- 14:05.040* :  the political situation. And the army were very keen on Imran because they thought that he was a
*14:05.040- 14:09.860* :  charismatic leader who would be a great frontman for them. He shared many of their values having
*14:09.860- 14:15.660* :  abandoned his playboy days and his love of London and the West. He became vitriolically anti-western
*14:15.660- 14:21.140* :  in every speech, Islamist nationalist, and therefore was in line with many army officers and
*14:21.140- 14:26.200* :  it seemed like they would get on famously and that he would be the perfect politician for them to
*14:26.200- 14:31.320* :  have in the public eye while they did a lot of the business of government, but his ego was too big,
*14:31.320- 14:37.520* :  his desire for control too great and they just in the end couldn't work together and it was
*14:37.640- 14:41.860* :  particularly problematic for the army because he was appealing to exactly the same base as the
*14:41.860- 14:46.460* :  army there, the Islamist nationalist mainstream in Pakistan. So they were fighting over the same
*14:46.460- 14:50.440* :  constituency and that made it particularly difficult for the army and the end they decided they
*14:50.440- 14:54.300* :  just couldn't tolerate it and they got rid of him. And you do say that he's very popular,
*14:54.300- 14:59.420* :  but is he also a divisive figure? Not really. When he was in power he did have huge support
*15:00.040- 15:04.120* :  because he was seen as not corrupt. I mean you've mentioned the case of these gifts that were sold
*15:04.240- 15:07.600* :  and I know people very close to him run who say in the old days he did used to do that when he got
*15:07.600- 15:11.660* :  given something. He's not very materialistic, he doesn't want this sort of stuff so you'd sell it
*15:11.760- 15:17.100* :  but it's nothing like other politicians who have leached hundreds of millions of dollars
*15:17.100- 15:22.260* :  which are sitting in Swiss bank accounts. He's not like that. The perception is that compared to
*15:22.260- 15:27.580* :  the other politicians he is not corrupt. And that was Owen Bennett Jones talking to Nulam
*15:27.580- 15:33.200* :  at Gavin. Now it's an all-too annoying phenomenon of the summer. Open a window at night
*15:33.200- 15:39.300* :  and insects swarm in buzzing crazily around the nearest light source. Well our scientists think
*15:39.300- 15:44.780* :  they have found out why as they revealed in the journal Nature Communications. Terry Egan has this
*15:44.780- 15:52.900* :  report. It's long been known that artificial light attracts flying insects. There are even
*15:52.900- 15:58.620* :  records from the Roman Empire describing the use of light to trap them. The reason though
*15:58.620- 16:05.280* :  has never really been clear. Now though researchers have used high-speed infrared cameras under a
*16:05.280- 16:11.780* :  range of light conditions to look at what's happening. Insects can't measure gravity while they're
*16:11.780- 16:18.160* :  flying so they solve the dilemma by using the direction of light. With natural light that's no
*16:18.160- 16:24.560* :  problem the sky is above them and they can orientate themselves using the horizon. But when it comes
*16:24.560- 16:32.540* :  to artificial light say the scientists insects confuse that light with up. It means they're continually
*16:32.540- 16:38.340* :  correcting the course of their flight so their backs face towards the light which they think is
*16:38.340- 16:44.700* :  up there somewhere and their fronts towards where they think gravity is. But because they're wrong
*16:44.700- 16:52.040* :  about all of that the imbalance leads them into all sorts of weird flight paths. It's why to us the
*16:52.040- 16:59.540* :  insects seem so erratic even you might say a bit light-headed. It's also why as we buzz about our
*16:59.540- 17:06.860* :  own business they can be so annoying to us humans. A report by Terry Egan
*17:09.920- 17:16.460* :  still to come on the global news podcast. If I had to pick between law and music I really hope
*17:16.460- 17:23.620* :  my mom doesn't hear this but I'll pick music today tomorrow the day after. The young Sierra
*17:23.620- 17:37.040* :  Leonian hoping to put her music on the global map. The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has
*17:37.040- 17:41.900* :  suffered a big setback after Parliament rejected an amnesty bill designed to protect some
*17:41.900- 17:48.180* :  Catalan separatist politicians. Mr. Sanchez needs their support after failing to win a majority
*17:48.180- 17:53.060* :  in last year's election but the party of the former Catalan president Carlos Puchdemont
*17:53.060- 17:58.220* :  actually voted against the bill saying it didn't go far enough. For more on what it means for
*17:58.220- 18:03.460* :  the Prime Minister I spoke to our correspondent Guy Hedgeko in Madrid. His government will survive
*18:03.460- 18:07.880* :  for the moment I think and certainly you know for the next few weeks I don't think people are
*18:07.880- 18:13.220* :  going to be talking about it collapsing but this was a big blow for him because he states so much
*18:13.220- 18:19.660* :  political capital on this amnesty. He needs the amnesty to be successful in order to maintain
*18:19.660- 18:25.160* :  the support of Catalan nationalist parties. For the moment the amnesty has not been able to go
*18:25.160- 18:29.220* :  through Congress so that's obviously a problem for him. The question now is whether he can get
*18:29.220- 18:36.200* :  the amnesty bill revised enough to the liking of Carlos Puchdemont and other Catalan nationalists
*18:36.640- 18:42.360* :  so that it can get the support in a few weeks time to go through Congress and therefore be approved
*18:42.360- 18:47.600* :  and implemented. Yeah because it's opposed from both sides both those Catalan's and the right
*18:47.600- 18:52.240* :  wingers who really hate it. Yeah this was quite a weird subterm of events because we had the
*18:52.500- 18:56.920* :  right wing opposition conservatives and the far right who frequently expressed opposition to
*18:56.920- 19:01.860* :  the amnesty saying it's unconstitutional. They voted against it but so too did the Catalan
*19:01.860- 19:07.640* :  nationalists of Mr Puchdemont's party. His reasons obviously were very different. He felt it just
*19:07.720- 19:14.720* :  wasn't good enough the law in terms of protecting him and others from investigations into alleged
*19:14.720- 19:21.120* :  terrorism. He's been linked to by a judicial investigation so he felt it wasn't the bullet proof
*19:21.120- 19:26.300* :  enough to go through and then resist any legal challenges in the future. And briefly what are
*19:26.300- 19:30.580* :  the public make of it? Well they're very divided on this. It's an extremely controversial bill.
*19:30.580- 19:35.980* :  I think that the political situation reflects how Spaniards feel. Generally speaking people on
*19:35.980- 19:41.580* :  the right tend to be more opposed to it. People on the left tend to be more supportive of the
*19:41.580- 19:47.240* :  amnesty. Up in Catalonia it has more support but it is very divisive. Go ahead and go and Madrid.
*19:48.040- 19:52.080* :  Collaric cases have been on the rise worldwide and more than half the countries affected
*19:52.080- 19:58.840* :  are in Africa. Zambia is battling its worst outbreak ever since October more than 550 people
*19:58.840- 20:03.800* :  have died from the preventable and treatable disease. Now the government has launched a mass
*20:03.800- 20:09.320* :  vaccination campaign in the hope of vastly reducing number of cases. The BBC's Kennedy
*20:09.320- 20:17.140* :  Goldway has been finding out how it's going. It's a sunny day at Lusaka's United Church
*20:17.140- 20:22.800* :  of Zambia Congregation in George Township. A choir marks the beginning of the mass vaccination
*20:22.800- 20:30.560* :  campaign against cholera. Children and adults line up to receive their dose. One of them is Sophia
*20:30.560- 20:38.360* :  Peri. I got the vaccine because a lot of people in my community were hiding that they were sick.
*20:39.000- 20:44.280* :  People would have stomach sickness and they are real but treated with traditional medicine.
*20:45.680- 20:52.060* :  Zambia is battling its worst ever outbreak of cholera. Authorities are rushing to provide vaccination
*20:52.140- 20:56.880* :  to more than one and a half million people that supplies are running low.
*20:58.020- 21:01.300* :  Sylvia Masevo is a Minister of Health in Zambia.
*21:13.020- 21:18.840* :  Zambia authorities have recorded more than 15,000 cholera infections since October.
*21:18.840- 21:24.400* :  The highest number the country has ever recorded. At the beginning of this year,
*21:24.720- 21:30.960* :  as cases were rising quickly, a businessman from Lusaka and Rukazadi got a call from the local
*21:30.960- 21:39.780* :  clinic. His 26-year-old nephew, Charles, was ill with cholera. We got a call informing us he
*21:39.780- 21:45.700* :  wasn't feeling well. Then the following day the clinic told us he was okay, that he was
*21:45.700- 21:54.420* :  chatsy. A day later I found out that he had died. More than 550 people have died so far in Zambia.
*21:54.840- 21:59.860* :  Authorities have closed schools and put tight regulations around the current out of
*21:59.860- 22:07.140* :  funerals to contain the spread. We had been told to look for a coffin so it could be buried
*22:07.740- 22:13.240* :  but if we delay then they'll bury him just like that. We are really grieving as a family.
*22:15.660- 22:20.880* :  Waterpams during water from shallow wells are a common site in Lusaka's townships
*22:21.380- 22:26.360* :  but the vicinity of pitlar trains can contaminate the water and spread cholera.
*22:28.920- 22:34.880* :  And to make matters worse, a heavy rainy season has brought floods to many areas of Lusaka.
*22:35.740- 22:40.800* :  Dr. Gabriel Polen is a national coordinator of Zambia's disaster management unit.
*22:41.320- 22:45.660* :  So what the rain does is that it complicates the living conditions of households that are
*22:45.700- 22:51.020* :  prone to flooding and because these households are getting their source of water from shallow
*22:51.020- 22:55.380* :  wells. But at the same time we see that there are some pitlar trains that they use that are
*22:55.800- 22:59.900* :  also getting flooded. It's a continuous mixing of fickle matter and the water.
*23:01.420- 23:06.740* :  In security and lack of access to clean water are finding the spread of cholera globally.
*23:07.280- 23:14.440* :  According to the WHO, more than 30 countries reported outbreaks last year. Half of them are in Africa.
*23:16.860- 23:22.580* :  Back in Zambia, the government is planning long-term measures to ensure an outbreak like this
*23:22.960- 23:28.660* :  doesn't happen again. Long-term is to reset some of these people who are in areas that cannot be
*23:28.660- 23:34.620* :  upgraded. For others it's upgrading, opening new roads and providing all the necessary
*23:34.620- 23:40.200* :  amenities like sanitation and wood water supply. But without a clear deadline in place,
*23:40.740- 23:45.420* :  people living in cholera-prone areas will love to manage the risk by themselves.
*23:46.760- 23:53.440* :  Kennedy Gondwe with that report. Universities may battle over funding or getting the best
*23:53.440- 23:59.740* :  students to even academic league tables, but a dispute between two colleges in the Thai
*23:59.740- 24:05.720* :  capital Bangkok has turned violent with deadly consequences. I heard more from my Asia-Pacific
*24:05.720- 24:12.740* :  editor, Celia Hatton. On Friday, a student at the Patemone Institute of Technology was stabbed
*24:12.740- 24:20.280* :  to death after a quite violent brawl. And that's led Thailand's education ministry to come out to
*24:20.280- 24:27.460* :  say that students from a rival school, that's the Uttenta Y campus at Ranjama Gala University.
*24:27.460- 24:30.680* :  That school won't be allowed to admit any new students.
*24:30.680- 24:37.260* :  They're also hastening up the school's relocation to another part of Thailand altogether.
*24:37.260- 24:43.180* :  These two schools have been at war for quite some time. They're located in the exact same
*24:43.180- 24:48.960* :  neighborhood in Bangkok. And so that's why the Ministry of Education is really hastening the
*24:48.960- 24:53.780* :  relocation of one school in an effort to stop this ongoing feud.
*24:53.980- 25:00.320* :  I mean, it seems extraordinary that a rivalry between two universities could erupt into violence.
*25:00.440- 25:06.420* :  I know you would think that, but this rivalry is incredibly intense, has caused many deaths
*25:06.420- 25:12.360* :  in injuries over the years. So even if we just go back to November, another student from the
*25:12.580- 25:17.940* :  Uttenta Y campus was killed after a brawl between gangs from the two schools,
*25:17.980- 25:24.040* :  a stray bullet also killed a teacher who didn't even teach at either school just happened to be
*25:24.340- 25:30.160* :  bypassing. There was such an uproar against the stray bullet death of this teacher
*25:30.900- 25:36.000* :  that the national police chief of Thailand in December had a big press conference and said
*25:36.000- 25:42.040* :  that he believed that criminal gangs were fueling this rivalry at both schools. He thought the
*25:42.040- 25:47.400* :  only way to stop this rivalry is to push ahead with the relocation of one of the schools.
*25:47.580- 25:51.460* :  Do we know what sparked the rivalry or is it just these gangs that have infiltrated?
*25:51.980- 25:57.300* :  A lot of people are saying that this rivalry is partly because these schools are so similar.
*25:57.300- 26:03.580* :  They teach similar programs and construction, technology, mechanics. They're located in the same
*26:03.580- 26:09.840* :  neighborhood. And so I think to differentiate themselves, they started this rivalry and over time
*26:09.840- 26:15.480* :  has just become more and more intense. So many people are aware of this rivalry in Thailand,
*26:15.480- 26:20.340* :  but I think at this point, many people are just fed up with it. They're saying just as the
*26:20.340- 26:24.700* :  Ministry of Education said that the relocation of one of these schools can't come soon enough.
*26:25.260- 26:32.460* :  Celia Hatten, our Asia-Pacific editor. Next to a legendary scene from a Russian film made nearly a
*26:38.440- 26:45.200* :  century ago. That is the 1925 silent movie Battleship Potemkin, or train citizens tumbling down a huge
*26:45.200- 26:50.640* :  flight of steps as Kossak shoot at them in Odessa in the then Soviet Republic of Ukraine.
*26:50.640- 26:56.000* :  Made by Sergei Eisenstein, it was one of the most famous productions of Russia's main film studio
*26:56.000- 27:02.080* :  Moss Film. It is now celebrating its 100th anniversary. And to tell us more, I spoke to our
*27:02.080- 27:09.180* :  Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhardt. Based in Moscow, it's seen a string of films. I mean,
*27:09.180- 27:13.600* :  at one time, Oli, it was producing more than 50 feature films a year and they said it's made
*27:13.600- 27:20.700* :  more than 2,000 feature films in its 100 year history. So truly colossal output. The first film
*27:20.700- 27:27.620* :  was a film called On Wings High. That film celebrated the heroism of Soviet pilots. Then it went on
*27:27.620- 27:32.880* :  in the 30s to become the Soviet equivalent of Hollywood doing propaganda films. And obviously
*27:32.880- 27:38.940* :  patriotic films during the Second World War fell on hard times in the late 80s and 90s when
*27:38.940- 27:44.260* :  state funding was withdrawn. But it managed to survive that and come back. And anyone who is
*27:44.740- 27:50.500* :  anyone in Soviet or Russian film, it seems, has worked there. You played battleship Potemkin
*27:50.500- 27:56.100* :  there from Sergei Eisenstein, often cited as one of the best films of all time. At its premiere,
*27:56.100- 28:03.280* :  there was a scene where the sailors raised a red flag and each frame of that was hand-tinted red,
*28:03.280- 28:08.120* :  which was a revolutionary act in itself. So much so that the film was actually banned in a number
*28:08.120- 28:13.380* :  of Western countries. But other directors Sergei Bondertuk, for example, did a seven hour
*28:13.800- 28:19.420* :  truly epic war and peace there in the 60s. That was the first Soviet film to win the best foreign
*28:19.420- 28:25.360* :  film in the Oscars. And it was also as cited as the most expensive film ever made with huge
*28:25.360- 28:31.220* :  battle scenes. So big that it actually had a stone special cavalry regiment formed for the film
*28:31.220- 28:38.280* :  that wasn't disbanded until the 2000s. Andres Tarkovsky, who did another great film classic
*28:38.280- 28:46.140* :  Andrei Rubilov, about the 15th century icon painter and Solaris, a 1972 science fiction film,
*28:46.460- 28:50.940* :  which had international success. Here's the film's English language trailer.
*28:52.580- 28:58.480* :  Let us take you with us to Solaris, planet of mystery, embodiment of man's latent conflict
*28:59.640- 29:05.120* :  Is Mossfilm still making films now? It's still very successful. It's modernised considerably
*29:05.120- 29:11.040* :  since the 1990s. And it's producing a large amount of output partly because of the war in Ukraine,
*29:11.040- 29:17.100* :  basically with Western filmmakers not releasing films in Russia. There's a huge demand for domestic
*29:17.100- 29:25.200* :  output. Danny Eberhard on 100 years of Mossfilm. Finally, to the story of a rising musical star in
*29:25.200- 29:31.660* :  Sierra Leone. Boy, who is not a boy but a young woman, has just been named a Sierra Leone's best
*29:31.660- 29:37.900* :  female musician of 2023. Her song, Credit Alert, made the chance in several countries.
*29:38.260- 29:42.800* :  She spoke to the BBC about her ambition to bring the music of Sierra Leone to the world stage.
*29:52.140- 29:58.600* :  Hey, what's up? This is Boy, aka your boyfriend from Sierra Leone, West Africa.
*29:59.260- 30:02.800* :  I'm 18 years old. I was born in three towns.
*30:08.240- 30:14.020* :  I was singing since I was six and then I started making music professionally about two years ago.
*30:23.160- 30:28.680* :  The first time I was in a studio or recorded a song, it was really magical. It was like a mix of
*30:28.680- 30:35.460* :  emotions. I was feeling nervous, very nervous because I had no experience whatsoever with
*30:35.960- 30:41.900* :  the booth, with mics, with the beats, with anything at all. I was just the dumbest in the room
*30:42.600- 30:47.920* :  and I was just trying my really best to impress everyone. But I was so excited at the same time
*30:48.420- 30:51.540* :  because I kind of felt like, oh, I belong here.
*30:53.120- 31:00.640* :  Fun facts about me, I study law and I do music. I do not recommend this to anyone. It's really
*31:00.640- 31:07.060* :  hard because both of them are like full-time careers that I have to really give my all too.
*31:07.800- 31:14.140* :  And with how life is going greatly, thank God, people actually know who I am. So when I go to
*31:14.140- 31:19.160* :  university, you would have people come up to you to take pictures and stuff like that. I like that
*31:19.160- 31:26.000* :  don't stop guys, but it's really hectic sometimes, but I'm making it work. If I had to pick between
*31:26.000- 31:33.300* :  law and music, I really hope my mom doesn't hear this, but I'll pick music. I'll pick music today
*31:33.300- 31:39.960* :  tomorrow, the day after, next year, the next century, my next birthday. I really love doing lots
*31:39.960- 31:42.600* :  too, but not just as much as I like doing music.
*31:51.240- 31:58.580* :  My first song that I recorded ever in my life was called Not Enough. The song is basically about
*31:58.580- 32:07.020* :  a couple. So they're dating and she feels like she's not, okay, that's literally the name of
*32:07.020- 32:14.020* :  the song, but she's not enough for the person she's dating her partner. And even though she tries
*32:14.020- 32:21.480* :  every single thing in the world to make herself seem good enough for them, they just don't appreciate it.
*32:27.820- 32:31.580* :  To be quite honest, I was kind of shocked. I was like, wait, people are going to be like,
*32:32.220- 32:38.800* :  what do you know about stuff like this? I'm in a family of mostly sisters and growing up with
*32:39.040- 32:44.100* :  a lot of other women. You're going to hear a lot about their relationship problems, even if you
*32:44.100- 32:54.840* :  like it or not. This can't be, baby. So no, speak. This herely union music scene is absolutely
*32:54.840- 33:02.000* :  beautiful in my opinion. We have really good music coming from here. The only sad part is it
*33:02.000- 33:07.400* :  doesn't go out of here. And that's really sad to me because it would be great if people could hear
*33:07.400- 33:15.600* :  music made in from Sierra Leone. I really hope it would happen through me and my music and performances
*33:15.600- 33:21.160* :  and stuff like that. Not that I don't want anyone else to do it. Come on now. I'm supportive to
*33:29.620- 33:32.940* :  everyone. Boy, a new star from Sierra Leone.
