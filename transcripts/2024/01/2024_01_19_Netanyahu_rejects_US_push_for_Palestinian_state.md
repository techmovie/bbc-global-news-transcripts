*01:38.240- 01:41.460* :  Hello, this is the Global News podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:43.460- 01:48.420* :  I'm Robin Brandt, and in the early hours of Friday the 19th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:49.040- 01:55.400* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly defied a US push for a Palestinian state
*01:55.400- 01:57.900* :  once the conflict in Gaza comes to an end.
*01:58.500- 02:03.280* :  In Northern India, thousands of men have joined a recruitment drive to send workers to Israel
*02:03.280- 02:08.200* :  as the war with Hamas has led to a shortage of labour, and the authorities in Ecuador
*02:08.200- 02:15.200* :  have detained two people accused of killing a leading prosecutor in the latest violence linked to the country's powerful gangs.
*02:17.340- 02:22.540* :  Also in this podcast were false teeth, a secret to Winston Churchill's wartime speeches.
*02:22.920- 02:29.440* :  There's four teeth together and then a gap in another two, so he obviously had six teeth taken out and these would fill in the gap.
*02:31.460- 02:37.260* :  We start in Israel where the country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he's told the US
*02:37.260- 02:42.740* :  that he's against the creation of a Palestinian state as part of any post-war settlement.
*02:43.340- 02:48.060* :  Mr Netanyahu used a nationally broadcast news conference to restate his position.
*02:51.800- 02:56.100* :  In any arrangement in the foreseeable future, with or without an arrangement,
*02:56.100- 03:01.960* :  the state of Israel must have security control over all territory west of the River Jordan.
*03:02.820- 03:07.680* :  This is a necessary condition and it conflicts with the idea of Palestinian sovereignty.
*03:07.960- 03:16.140* :  I've told this truth to our American friends and I've also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security.
*03:16.140- 03:21.940* :  Well, those words from Israel's Prime Minister brought a critical response from his country's closest ally.
*03:21.940- 03:30.960* :  A US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller insisted there is no way to ensure Israel's long-term security without a two-state solution.
*03:31.620- 03:37.460* :  We will continue to reiterate to the leadership of Israel, the government of Israel, and to the people of Israel
*03:37.960- 03:41.860* :  that these are the opportunities that they have, these are the challenges that they face,
*03:41.860- 03:47.320* :  but there is no way to solve their long-term challenges, to provide lasting security,
*03:47.320- 03:53.000* :  and there is no way to solve the short-term challenges of rebuilding Gaza and establishing governance in Gaza
*03:53.000- 03:57.920* :  and providing security for Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state.
*03:58.200- 04:03.480* :  Well, having heard those words from the US Department of State and before that Israel's Prime Minister,
*04:03.940- 04:07.040* :  I got more from our correspondent in Washington DC, Tom Beatman.
*04:07.520- 04:11.780* :  I get the sense that the State Department, the sort of American machinery of diplomacy,
*04:12.580- 04:15.560* :  is getting a bit frustrated and irritated, really.
*04:15.860- 04:21.580* :  Remember Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent a week in the region just over a week ago,
*04:21.580- 04:23.520* :  or he returned just over a week ago?
*04:24.060- 04:29.240* :  And I think reading between the lines of what the comments we've had from Mr Netanyahu today,
*04:29.240- 04:32.760* :  you know, where he's used this phrase from the river to the sea,
*04:33.200- 04:36.520* :  must all be under the security control of Israel,
*04:37.120- 04:40.160* :  and what the Americans were doing over the course of that week,
*04:40.580- 04:43.420* :  Antony Blinken, Secretary of State, was going around the region
*04:43.420- 04:49.600* :  and saying to Arab leaders, look, if you will basically help reconstruct, rebuild,
*04:49.600- 04:53.920* :  and then crucially help with a plan to secure Gaza
*04:54.480- 04:57.560* :  and get a sort of Palestinian-led governance going,
*04:58.140- 04:59.920* :  then, you know, what are you asking in return?
*05:00.060- 05:02.640* :  And what the Arab leaders are saying is a Palestinian state.
*05:03.180- 05:04.800* :  So that's what's on the table.
*05:04.960- 05:07.860* :  And the Americans are basically trying to push for this kind of arrangement,
*05:07.860- 05:12.120* :  this kind of deal, where you would have the sort of long-sought two-state solution
*05:12.120- 05:14.480* :  of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank,
*05:14.840- 05:18.420* :  East Jerusalem, and Gaza in return for a secure Israel.
*05:18.900- 05:21.680* :  Now, unsurprisingly, Benjamin Netanyahu,
*05:21.680- 05:24.960* :  who leads the most right-wing government in Israel's history,
*05:24.960- 05:29.720* :  containing anti-vimitly anti-Arab caharnist,
*05:29.760- 05:35.040* :  which is a sort of movement that believes in the forcible expulsion of Arabs,
*05:35.040- 05:37.840* :  some ministers in the government are from that movement.
*05:38.360- 05:42.260* :  You know, he's always opposed a Palestinian state in recent history,
*05:42.260- 05:44.800* :  has argued for once under American pressure in the past,
*05:45.140- 05:48.000* :  but it's no secret that he opposes a Palestinian state.
*05:48.260- 05:52.100* :  Now he's saying it very clearly, absolutely rejecting it,
*05:52.240- 05:54.200* :  and he says, I'm telling the Americans this.
*05:54.480- 05:55.640* :  So he's playing to his own base,
*05:55.880- 05:58.380* :  but he's saying it very forcefully, that's annoying the Americans.
*05:58.640- 06:00.580* :  So just to speak to a failure of diplomacy,
*06:00.620- 06:04.860* :  and a failure to try to achieve what Anthony Blinken is trying to do,
*06:04.860- 06:09.940* :  or frankly do the Americans know that pursuing the war is one thing,
*06:09.940- 06:12.160* :  but what comes after it is something different,
*06:12.180- 06:13.300* :  and that's a longer game.
*06:13.440- 06:14.680* :  I have to be honest, you know,
*06:14.680- 06:17.320* :  I've just spent nearly seven years in Jerusalem
*06:17.420- 06:19.840* :  and coming over this side of the Atlantic
*06:19.840- 06:21.040* :  and reporting it from Washington,
*06:21.040- 06:25.640* :  it feels such a disconnect between the diplomatic position
*06:26.220- 06:29.700* :  and the absolute catastrophe of what is happening on the ground,
*06:29.700- 06:32.480* :  you know, from the October the 7th attacks by Hamas
*06:32.980- 06:37.760* :  through to this catastrophic war, massive loss of civilian life.
*06:38.400- 06:43.300* :  And Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Advisors in Davos this week,
*06:43.500- 06:45.360* :  and he said, you know, they want to try and get up
*06:45.360- 06:47.340* :  independent Palestinian state in the short term,
*06:47.340- 06:49.320* :  that this is basically something they're not going to wait years for.
*06:49.320- 06:54.040* :  They think that this is now a historic opportunity for everyone to seize.
*06:54.840- 06:58.640* :  But I think that you would suddenly speed from the events of October the 7th and the war
*06:59.260- 07:00.820* :  to a two-state solution.
*07:00.820- 07:04.600* :  Seems to me, you know, wishful thinking probably at best.
*07:05.680- 07:07.760* :  Well, let's stay in the United States
*07:07.760- 07:09.880* :  because the Biden administration has said
*07:10.440- 07:13.680* :  that it has launched further air strikes on Houthi rebels based in Yemen,
*07:14.280- 07:17.300* :  the White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby
*07:17.300- 07:19.780* :  said the strikes destroyed Houthi missiles
*07:20.020- 07:22.380* :  that were being prepared for use in the Red Sea.
*07:22.980- 07:26.280* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams assesses the situation.
*07:27.020- 07:30.680* :  One thing we can definitely rule out, at least for the time being,
*07:30.680- 07:33.340* :  is any notion of boots on the ground.
*07:33.540- 07:38.120* :  The idea that the West, the Americans, the British would wade into Yemen,
*07:38.120- 07:43.740* :  having watched the war that Saudi Arabia waged in Yemen for years and years and years.
*07:44.060- 07:45.180* :  That's just unthinkable.
*07:45.500- 07:47.680* :  So the hope, clearly, the hope in Washington and London
*07:48.160- 07:52.060* :  is that this military pressure ultimately will persuade the Houthis
*07:52.460- 07:55.900* :  that this course of action into interfering with shipping in the Red Sea
*07:55.900- 07:58.400* :  and lobbying the occasional missile in the direction of Israel
*07:58.800- 08:00.720* :  that this is simply not worth it.
*08:01.020- 08:05.560* :  And of course, behind the scenes there will be words being had with Iran,
*08:06.160- 08:07.180* :  you know, effectively saying,
*08:07.180- 08:12.160* :  look, tell your allies to the extent that they will do your bidding.
*08:12.160- 08:15.880* :  And that's, by the way, you know, questionable to the extent that you have
*08:15.880- 08:19.580* :  influence over them, tell them to stop because this is just not in anyone's interest.
*08:20.000- 08:24.240* :  Paul Adams reporting, thousands of men have queued in northern India
*08:24.240- 08:27.160* :  during a recruitment drive to send workers to Israel.
*08:27.700- 08:31.320* :  Israel needs more workers because it's month-long war with Hamas
*08:31.320- 08:32.940* :  has led to a shortage of labor there.
*08:33.380- 08:34.920* :  Ambrassan Etirajan reports.
*08:35.660- 08:41.260* :  Israeli media said the country was planning to bring in about 70,000 workers from India,
*08:41.260- 08:44.020* :  China, and elsewhere to meet the labor shortage.
*08:44.580- 08:47.260* :  The construction sector, which had employed Palestinians
*08:47.260- 08:50.080* :  prior to the war, had come to a standstill.
*08:50.560- 08:53.480* :  Some of the Indian workers looking to go to Israel said
*08:53.480- 08:58.660* :  they could make five times more money in a year there than they could earn at home.
*08:59.120- 09:04.600* :  In May 2023, India and Israel signed a deal to allow around 40,000
*09:04.600- 09:08.520* :  Indians to work in the Jewish state, mainly in the fields of construction,
*09:09.880- 09:11.100* :  Ambrassan Etirajan.
*09:12.080- 09:16.940* :  When a gunman burst into a school in Yvaldi in the U.S. state of Texas in 2022,
*09:16.940- 09:23.200* :  hundreds of police descended on the area, but it took more than an hour for them to confront him.
*09:23.640- 09:25.960* :  19 students were murdered and two teachers.
*09:25.960- 09:31.500* :  But two years on and in an exhaustive report, authorities say the response was a failure
*09:31.980- 09:35.600* :  and lives could have been saved if the officers had acted more quickly.
*09:36.060- 09:37.840* :  Merit Garland is the U.S. Attorney General.
*09:38.560- 09:40.680* :  Their loved ones deserve better.
*09:40.860- 09:47.120* :  The law enforcement response at Rob Elementary School on May 24, 2022 and in the hours and days
*09:47.120- 09:51.060* :  after was a failure that should not have happened.
*09:51.060- 09:56.700* :  We hope to honor the victims and the survivors by working together to try to prevent anything like
*09:56.700- 10:01.900* :  this from ever happening again here or anywhere.
*10:02.740- 10:07.480* :  Will the report into what happened at Rob Elementary School is nearly 600 pages long?
*10:08.020- 10:12.400* :  It found, quote, cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics,
*10:12.400- 10:19.280* :  policy and training. It also described a lack of urgency in the 77 minutes before the gunman
*10:19.280- 10:24.500* :  was finally confronted and killed. The U.S. Associate Attorney General, Venita Gupta,
*10:24.880- 10:28.960* :  gave disturbing details about the plight of those who survived the shooting.
*10:29.660- 10:36.580* :  There was no plan to triage the 35 victims in classrooms 111 and 112, many of whom had been shot.
*10:37.080- 10:41.340* :  Victims were moved away without precautions. Without appropriate precautions,
*10:41.460- 10:45.780* :  victims who had already passed away were taken to the hospital in ambulances,
*10:46.460- 10:50.960* :  where children with bullet wounds were put on school buses without any medical attention.
*10:51.780- 10:58.960* :  In the commotion, one adult victim was placed on a walkway on the ground outside to be a
*10:58.960- 11:06.340* :  attended to. She died there. Well, after hearing details like that at Thursday's news conference,
*11:06.340- 11:11.160* :  some of the families gave their reaction to the report. This man lost his daughter.
*11:13.260- 11:21.500* :  These officers who sit there and just not do anything, you know, and still be out here,
*11:22.340- 11:27.420* :  you know, on the streets like nothing happened, you know, and my daughter's gone. It was hard.
*11:28.280- 11:32.100* :  Well, picking up from that, I spoke to our North America correspondent, Emma Vardi,
*11:32.100- 11:37.080* :  and started by asking her what is going to happen to some of those officers who responded to the
*11:37.080- 11:42.680* :  shooting. There is also a criminal investigation on going into the police response that is yet
*11:42.680- 11:47.120* :  to conclude some family members want to see criminal prosecutions. They want to see
*11:47.120- 11:52.460* :  resignations from the key officers involved, and family members are also bringing civil lawsuits
*11:52.460- 11:58.320* :  against officers involved too. So that will have to run its course. But today, lawyer representing
*11:58.320- 12:03.140* :  the families said, look, families didn't need it. This hundreds of pages of a report to know
*12:03.140- 12:07.920* :  that officers had failed, although they do appreciate that this has now been published,
*12:08.480- 12:13.420* :  and that in a sense, it does validate many of the criticisms that they had. But this won't be
*12:13.420- 12:18.480* :  the end for families. They will keep on campaigning for change and potentially for much harder penalties
*12:18.480- 12:22.920* :  against the officers involved. And let's go back to the failings that were exposed in such
*12:22.920- 12:28.800* :  detail. I mean, why did it take so long? It was an awful combination of bad communication,
*12:28.800- 12:33.840* :  misinformation and confusion at the scene. The most significant failing that has been highlighted
*12:33.840- 12:38.560* :  in this report is the officers who were first on the scene. They retreated from the classrooms,
*12:38.560- 12:42.960* :  and they treated the gunmen as someone who had barricaded themselves in, not treating them
*12:42.960- 12:47.680* :  as what's called an active shooter in the US. They should have recognized the situation
*12:47.740- 12:52.060* :  immediately. And if they had done, then the protocol is that they should have pushed forward
*12:52.060- 12:56.740* :  and entered the classrooms until the gunman was taken down until the threat was eliminated.
*12:56.740- 13:01.400* :  And that wasn't done. Now, the police chief of the district who was de facto the on-scene
*13:01.400- 13:06.400* :  commander who arrived early on, he comes in for a lot of criticism in this report. It said that
*13:06.400- 13:11.120* :  he discarded his radios on arrival, thinking they weren't needed. That meant that he was giving
*13:11.120- 13:16.160* :  commands verbally or over mobile phones to communicate to the officers on the scene. There was no
*13:16.160- 13:21.800* :  command structure set up, and he actually directed officers to pull back, not to enter classrooms,
*13:21.800- 13:27.300* :  and had that been different than potentially lives could have been saved. So a lot of criticisms
*13:27.300- 13:32.500* :  at all levels here, and it will make very emotional reading for family members to imagine that
*13:32.500- 13:36.660* :  all that time that police were stood outside classrooms. Sometimes they were looking for keys,
*13:36.660- 13:42.160* :  rather than just making an entry, forcing an entry to the classroom where the gunman was,
*13:42.300- 13:47.360* :  was stuck inside there, all the many victims and the teachers who were stuck inside there with him.
*13:49.220- 13:53.700* :  Next, let's go to Ecuador, where the authorities have detained two people accused of killing a
*13:53.700- 13:58.160* :  leading prosecutor. In the latest violence, linked to the country's powerful gangs.
*13:58.180- 14:03.460* :  The prosecutor, Cesar Suarez, was shot dead as he drove on a motorway on Wednesday,
*14:04.100- 14:09.040* :  in the port city of Guarquil. He'd been in charge of the investigation into the assault last
*14:09.040- 14:15.600* :  week on a TV studio, as a live broadcast was taking place. Under the state of emergency powers
*14:15.600- 14:20.880* :  approved last week by the country's president, Daniel Nabor, hundreds of soldiers have been
*14:20.880- 14:26.300* :  deployed to a key prison in Guarquil to take control. They've seized dozens of knives,
*14:26.300- 14:32.420* :  other sharp objects, and mobile phones used illegally by the inmates. My colleague, Julia Marshall,
*14:32.420- 14:37.000* :  spoke to Carolina Loseleon, a journalist who spent the day in Guarquil.
*14:37.860- 14:42.000* :  It seems he was about a thousand police officers that had gone into the early morning,
*14:42.000- 14:49.180* :  is to raid for any ammunition and guns in the prison cells. We know that all the inmates were
*14:49.180- 14:54.460* :  moved outside and were caught by surprise. We're sleeping, and then the raid is undergoing.
*14:54.460- 15:00.760* :  They're still to find something they have, they have found guns and ammunition, but to see if there
*15:00.780- 15:05.800* :  was any sign that there are signs of their organization coming from the jail to the assassination
*15:05.800- 15:11.300* :  of the prosecutor, of this case. It seems to be that the reason, but this has been going on.
*15:11.300- 15:15.340* :  It's a fourth day that there's some kind of operation in that specific prison,
*15:15.340- 15:20.680* :  since the whole chaos has started after the prison break of Adolfo Macias, known as Pico.
*15:21.020- 15:25.940* :  And are there any prison staffs still being held hostage, either at this
*15:25.940- 15:31.520* :  prison in Guarquil or elsewhere in the country? No prison guys are held hostage. However,
*15:31.520- 15:36.500* :  there's not much of a full control of the government in all of the prisons. So,
*15:36.500- 15:40.020* :  sometimes, because these are huge complexes, especially the one in Guarquil,
*15:40.500- 15:44.700* :  there are areas that are not under their control, and this is why they're carrying out these raids,
*15:44.700- 15:49.940* :  especially that, as you mentioned, it's the nerve of drug trafficking trade right now. It's
*15:49.940- 15:55.240* :  Guarquil, and that person in Guarquil is key. I was there yesterday in the outside. They don't let
*15:55.240- 16:00.880* :  any press in. And it was eerily quiet, so there were no visitors, there are no visits allowed,
*16:01.380- 16:06.440* :  even the people that would have businesses outside like food stalls. Most of them were closed.
*16:06.440- 16:12.840* :  So, it was an eerily quiet and a calm, yet tense environment that we see all over the country
*16:12.840- 16:16.840* :  this past few years. It was the same outside the prison. Well, that was the journalist Karolina
*16:16.840- 16:24.820* :  Loseleon in Ecuador. Still to come. Until now, we didn't know that emissions that are created
*16:24.820- 16:30.160* :  under water, like bottom trolling, actually are released into the atmosphere. Scientists highlight
*16:30.160- 16:36.560* :  the dangers to the climates of the industrial fishing technique that drags vast nets along the sea floor.
*16:40.060- 16:46.140* :  This is the story of the charismatic Nigerian preacher, TB Joshua. Some called him a miracle worker.
*16:50.880- 16:57.280* :  Others say they knew a very different man. He's not this holy man. What happened to me and to others?
*16:57.280- 17:03.380* :  Should I open to any human being? This is World of Secrets from the BBC World Service.

*17:16.060- 17:20.720* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*17:20.980- 17:25.920* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising
*17:25.920- 17:31.100* :  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*17:31.360- 17:36.400* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*18:16.360- 18:22.600* :  Hello again and welcome back to the Global News podcast.
*18:23.440- 18:28.600* :  Estonia has told the head of its branch of the Russian Orthodox Church to leave the country,
*18:28.600- 18:33.960* :  calling him a threat to national security. The authorities say he has repeatedly refused
*18:33.960- 18:39.560* :  to distance himself from the Kremlin and the government of Vladimir Putin. Our Europe regional
*18:39.560- 18:45.520* :  editor, Alice Adely, has more. The 66-year-old Russian bishop, Valery Rashetnikov,
*18:45.520- 18:51.000* :  has been in Estonia for four years and has had several temporary residence permits.
*18:51.140- 18:56.720* :  The current one expires on February the 6th and he's been told it's not being renewed.
*18:56.820- 19:02.800* :  Police said he had repeatedly been asked to stop justifying Russia's invasion of Ukraine
*19:02.800- 19:08.040* :  and defending the Kremlin. The head of the Estonian Police and Border Guard Bureau,
*19:08.040- 19:13.840* :  Indrek Aru, said the bishop's public actions and speeches were, as Mr. Aru put it,
*19:14.140- 19:15.760* :  supportive of the aggressor.
*19:18.300- 19:22.580* :  In the case of this person, we have reason to believe that he represents a security threat
*19:23.000- 19:28.180* :  to the Republic of Estonia. It's not related to the church in any way. It's related to a particular
*19:28.180- 19:33.500* :  person, but certainly not related to the religious movement in general. We don't see a problem there.
*19:34.300- 19:40.140* :  Neither the Russian Orthodox Church nor Valery Rashetnikov have made any comments since the
*19:40.140- 19:45.780* :  announcement. However, in October 2022, the bishop said he was opposed to conflict.
*19:53.640- 19:58.900* :  The bishop's expulsion is the culmination of long-standing tensions between the largely secular
*19:58.900- 20:04.680* :  Estonian state and the Orthodox Church, which is the country's biggest religion and is well
*20:04.680- 20:11.760* :  attended by its sizeable Russian minority population. Estonia and its Baltic neighbours are among
*20:11.780- 20:17.080* :  the staunchest supporters of Ukraine, as it battles against Russia's invasion.
*20:34.660- 20:40.960* :  Newly appointed senior Vatican cleric, after that cleric was criticised for writing what has
*20:40.960- 20:45.600* :  been described by some as a sex manual. Here's our religion editor, Ali Mukbul.
*20:46.460- 20:52.420* :  Sexual pleasure is a gift from God. So, said Pope Francis, it is general audience that
*20:52.420- 20:56.780* :  should be to square this week. It's not a comment that came completely out of the blue,
*20:56.780- 21:02.760* :  but is seen by many as his response to traditionalist critics who've been taking aim at one of the
*21:02.760- 21:08.420* :  most powerful figures in the Vatican. Viktor Manuel Fernandez, an Argentinian who's close to the
*21:08.420- 21:14.820* :  Pope, was made both a cardinal and the Vatican's head of doctrine last September. But it's also now
*21:14.820- 21:20.300* :  been revealed that in the 90s, when he'd already been a priest for 12 years, he wrote a quickly
*21:20.300- 21:26.340* :  withdrawn book called Mystical Passion, which included what he called research with a group of
*21:26.340- 21:32.340* :  married couples about the difference in nature of the male and female orgasm. Catholic
*21:32.340- 21:37.820* :  priests themselves, of course, are required to remain celibate. The fact that Cardinal Fernandez
*21:37.820- 21:43.780* :  says, even before appointing him to a senior position, the Pope was aware of his book and another
*21:43.780- 21:49.980* :  he wrote on the art of kissing has incensed some conservative Catholics. They've long accused
*21:49.980- 21:55.200* :  Pope Francis and those he surrounds himself with of moving away from the church's traditional
*21:55.200- 22:02.140* :  teachings. But the Pope's response now suggests he's not too worried about the storm around the book.
*22:02.860- 22:07.920* :  Ali Magboul reporting. It's been known for some time that the industrial fishing technique
*22:07.920- 22:13.680* :  called bottom trawling, that's dragging vast nets along the sea floor, can destroy habitats.
*22:14.360- 22:19.720* :  But new research has for the first time calculated another harmful effect, the amount of carbon
*22:19.720- 22:25.540* :  that's churned up and released from the sea floor. The marine ecologist, Enrique Sulla, is the
*22:25.540- 22:31.620* :  senior author of the study and also founder of National Geographic's pristine seas project based
*22:31.620- 22:36.620* :  in Washington DC. What my colleague Tim Franks asked him how much of a problem this type of
*22:36.620- 22:43.780* :  fishing is as regards the release of carbon. This is potentially one of the major sources of marine
*22:43.780- 22:48.140* :  carbon, released into the atmosphere. Until now we didn't know that emissions that are created
*22:48.140- 22:53.880* :  underwater like bottom trawling actually are released into the atmosphere. Right, so you've been
*22:53.880- 23:00.780* :  able to calculate both how this happens and also in what sort of quantity. Yes, we estimated
*23:01.340- 23:07.140* :  on a study a couple of years ago that bottom trawling by disturbing, by scraping the sediment on
*23:07.140- 23:13.140* :  the sea floor and the carbon in it, parts of that carbon turns into carbon dioxide and that
*23:13.140- 23:18.980* :  amount of carbon dioxide every year is potentially on the same order of magnitude as global aviation.
*23:19.260- 23:25.700* :  Good grief. I mean, that is extraordinary. It is an enormous amount of emissions that have been
*23:25.700- 23:31.080* :  an accounted for to date and of course we need more studies to verify our first results but
*23:31.520- 23:37.580* :  this is potentially a source of emissions that is too big to ignore. Right, I mean, people have
*23:37.580- 23:42.440* :  been complaining about this type of fishing for a long time because we know that it can destroy
*23:42.440- 23:49.940* :  the habitats under in the sea, at the bottom of the sea, given what you're talking about in terms of
*23:50.420- 23:56.220* :  how it can help drive climate change as well. I mean, I've realised this isn't probably part of
*23:56.220- 24:01.140* :  your scientific research, but are there other efforts made to try and limit the use of this technique?
*24:01.660- 24:06.900* :  Not really. Actually, this technique is subsidized by governments with taxpayers' money. There was
*24:06.900- 24:13.960* :  another study released last week showing that the United Kingdom government is subsidizing fishing
*24:13.960- 24:22.680* :  with 150 to 180 million pounds every year. Given that you have now come up with this research,
*24:22.720- 24:28.180* :  I mean, presumably you're you're hoping that there will be a recaculation for just the sort of
*24:28.580- 24:35.040* :  cost to this type of fishing. No, absolutely. Bottom trolling is this technique that uses this heavy
*24:35.040- 24:40.660* :  and nets scouring the sea floor, destroying everything in its path until you have nothing but mud.
*24:40.660- 24:46.300* :  And also, it is economically unprofitable because without government subsidies, many of
*24:46.300- 24:50.900* :  these bottom trolling fisheries would not be profitable. And third, now we know it has a climate
*24:50.900- 24:56.740* :  impact that is similar to the emissions that we are used to, the rest of the emissions that end
*24:56.740- 25:02.960* :  up in the atmosphere. That was the marine ecologist Enrique Salla. Next, the latest instrument in our
*25:02.960- 25:08.580* :  reporting on the movie and TV award season, the nominations for the BAFTAs, which recognizes the
*25:08.580- 25:15.300* :  UK stars and productions are out and Oppenheimer looks set to continue its dominance. The epic
*25:15.300- 25:19.840* :  about the development of the atomic bomb has 13 nominations is Colin Patterson.
*25:21.020- 25:26.340* :  This is a national emergency. Oppenheimer. Christopher Nolan's three-hour epic about the birth of
*25:26.340- 25:33.120* :  the atomic bomb, hugely long, hugely successful at the box office and now hugely rewarded by BAFTA
*25:33.120- 25:43.160* :  with 13 nominations including Best Actor for Killian Murphy and recognition in the supporting
*25:43.160- 25:49.280* :  categories for Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. There was also a strong showing by poor things.
*25:49.360- 25:56.120* :  It is an experiment. Good evening. The dark fantasy has 11 nominations with Emma Stone in Best
*25:56.120- 26:01.440* :  Actress, although its director, Jorgus Lentamos, was left out of the Best Director category.
*26:01.980- 26:08.880* :  And that wasn't the only notable snub. Martin Scorsese's killers of the flower moon about
*26:08.880- 26:15.400* :  the murder of Native Americans in 1920s Oklahoma may have had nine nominations, but its stars,
*26:15.400- 26:22.140* :  Lily Gladstone and Leonardo DiCaprio both missed out, although Robert De Niro did secure his first
*26:22.140- 26:28.780* :  acting nomination since Goodfellas 33 years ago. And it was the surprise to many that the biggest
*26:28.780- 26:32.900* :  box office hit of the year Barbie was not included in Best Picture.
*26:33.060- 26:39.140* :  It's total of five nominations was the same achieved by another very different film,
*26:39.140- 26:46.360* :  directed by one of Barbie's cast. Emerald Finale played Barbie's friend Mitch.
*26:46.360- 26:52.160* :  She also wrote and directed Saltburn, a twisted British satire about class and privilege,
*26:52.160- 26:54.940* :  which is in the running for outstanding British film.
*26:55.260- 27:03.060* :  Saltburn is an entirely British crew. We were over 50% women on our cast and crew as well,
*27:03.060- 27:07.520* :  which meant a great deal to us. The winners will be announced on the 18th of February.
*27:09.200- 27:13.220* :  Colin Patterson on the BAFTAs. Now, false teeth belonging to Britain's
*27:13.220- 27:17.500* :  wartime prime minister Winston Churchill are going up for auction here in the UK.
*27:17.500- 27:23.380* :  They're expected to be sold for more than $10,000. The gold-mounted teeth, which were
*27:23.380- 27:28.780* :  constructed to preserve Churchill's distinctive speaking style, are one of a handful of sets made
*27:28.780- 27:34.200* :  for him. The upper dentures date from around the start of the Second World War. Claire Ronikers has more.
*27:34.920- 27:39.560* :  So Winston Churchill was better known for his rousing speeches than for his terrible teeth.
*27:39.560- 27:45.280* :  He lost several in his 20s, so opted for false ones to fill the gaps. When his dentures were
*27:45.280- 27:48.960* :  made, he ensured his distinctive list, which had developed in childhood, would remain.
*27:49.660- 27:53.740* :  Liz Pool, as a director at the Cotswold Auction House, where the false teeth are being sold,
*27:53.740- 27:58.440* :  describes what this set looks like. Some people call it a bridge, so it's not a false
*27:58.440- 28:03.100* :  set of dentures. This is a curved piece of gold that would curve up into the top of the mouth
*28:03.100- 28:08.920* :  with two loops that hooked over a tooth on either side and then there's four teeth together and
*28:08.920- 28:13.760* :  then a gap in another two. So he obviously had six teeth taken out and these would fill in the gap.
*28:14.180- 28:17.480* :  It's thought to be one of three or four identical sets he owned.
*28:17.480- 28:23.400* :  It's said he liked to carry two on his person at any one time. One set is buried with him,
*28:23.760- 28:30.220* :  another's in a museum, and this one goes up for sale next month. Claire Ronikers on a very famous set
*28:30.220- 28:36.160* :  of false teeth. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global
