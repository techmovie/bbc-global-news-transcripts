*01:29.200- 01:30.320* :  your BBC podcasts.
*01:31.600- 01:34.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:37.380- 01:42.360* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Sunday the 28th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:42.780- 01:48.000* :  Pressure is growing on the United Nations and its agency in Gaza, Unruwa, as Germany,
*01:48.000- 01:52.120* :  Britain and Australia join other countries in suspending their contributions.
*01:53.040- 01:58.140* :  Washington has warned that it could restore sanctions on Venezuela after the opposition leader
*01:58.140- 02:00.740* :  was barred from this year's presidential poll.
*02:01.300- 02:05.880* :  In Kenya there have been demonstrations in a number of cities protesting against the rising
*02:05.880- 02:07.600* :  tide of violence towards women.
*02:10.380- 02:16.520* :  Also in this podcast, when I was a boy there were maybe 200 cranes here in winter.
*02:17.080- 02:18.060* :  Now it's 8,000.
*02:18.700- 02:22.180* :  The young ones that come here with their parents never learn how to fly further south,
*02:22.840- 02:24.300* :  so they don't pass it on to their children.
*02:24.820- 02:30.540* :  Scientists have discovered that because of climate change, some birds like cranes and no longer
*02:30.540- 02:33.400* :  migrating to places that were once considered warmer.
*02:38.420- 02:42.120* :  Pressure is growing on the United Nations and its operation in Gaza.
*02:42.500- 02:47.000* :  Britain and Australia on Saturday joined other countries in suspending their contributions
*02:47.000- 02:50.660* :  to Unruwa, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.
*02:51.240- 02:55.920* :  Later in the day, Germany announced it would follow suit and that one could really hurt.
*02:55.980- 03:01.560* :  As it was, Unruwa's second largest donor, this withdrawal of support follows allegations
*03:01.560- 03:07.040* :  that 12 Unruwa staff members took part in the Hamas-October 7th attacks on Israel.
*03:07.720- 03:12.900* :  Israel, of course, has never been a fan of the UN, but it's now up the ante by saying
*03:12.900- 03:16.880* :  it's determined to permanently stop Unruwa from operating in Gaza.
*03:17.340- 03:21.440* :  And Tel Aviv is also calling for the resignation of the UN Agency's boss.
*03:22.100- 03:27.100* :  But there are some who've moved to defend Unruwa, they point out it has 30,000 people working
*03:27.100- 03:32.060* :  under its auspices and that the 12 who've been accused were all instantly sacked.
*03:32.060- 03:34.400* :  Chris Gunniss is a former Unruwa spokesperson.
*03:35.220- 03:40.640* :  He says Israel has a long history of making claims about the agency, which turn out not
*03:40.640- 03:41.240* :  to be true.
*03:41.560- 03:46.600* :  We had allegations that Unruwa was hiding rockets, components in its schools and was colluding
*03:46.880- 03:48.220* :  with Hamas terrorists.
*03:48.440- 03:53.180* :  In fact, it was Unruh that found the rocket parts in its schools immediately reported to
*03:53.180- 03:55.900* :  all our major donors and the Israelis condemned it.
*03:56.040- 03:57.000* :  What do we get in reply?
*03:57.000- 04:01.300* :  We got further accusations, in spite of having done all this, that we were colluding with terrorists.
*04:01.700- 04:06.220* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem, Mark Lohan, and asked him first how much
*04:06.220- 04:10.580* :  difference it would make to Unruwa's operations to lose these major funders.
*04:11.000- 04:14.100* :  Well, just remember that two of the countries who have paused funding, Paul,
*04:14.100- 04:19.120* :  are permanent members of the UN Security Council, so pretty significant donors, of course,
*04:19.120- 04:28.320* :  to UN Missions, and the UN Mission for Palestinian refugees is the largest UN agency operating in Gaza,
*04:28.880- 04:31.540* :  and of course it is a really significant UN civilian mission.
*04:31.540- 04:36.560* :  So it is a significant blow, I think, as long as it lasts, because of course it is temporary,
*04:36.560- 04:40.120* :  and it is while the UN launches this investigation.
*04:40.560- 04:45.720* :  My sense, Paul, is that this will have as much impact on the ground as it will have a kind of
*04:45.720- 04:53.080* :  symbolic show of understanding and assistance to Israel at this moment, because Israel's
*04:53.080- 04:57.800* :  Western Allies are putting a lot of pressure on it over its military offensive, so they want to
*04:57.800- 05:03.480* :  be seen to be understanding these very serious allegations, lending a hand to their ally,
*05:03.980- 05:07.720* :  while at the same time putting continued pressure on them on the ground in Gaza.
*05:07.720- 05:10.460* :  So it is a bit of a diplomatic dance to some extent as well.
*05:10.740- 05:15.380* :  Israel says it's determined to stop UN Ruwa operating in Gaza altogether,
*05:15.380- 05:21.260* :  others are refusing to see the whole organization damned by the actions of what they say are a
*05:21.260- 05:26.960* :  very tiny minority of the number of staff there. Is it possible at this stage to get an idea
*05:26.960- 05:29.720* :  who's winning in the battle for international opinion?
*05:30.280- 05:36.180* :  Well, I think that it's a slow burn in that with each kind of new casualty figure,
*05:36.180- 05:42.840* :  with each step in this offensive, the international narrative has formed and is continually
*05:42.840- 05:46.420* :  forming around, you know, whether the Israelis are right, whether the Palestinians are right.
*05:46.860- 05:50.340* :  I mean, on Friday when the International Court of Justice said that Israel needed to do everything
*05:50.340- 05:55.700* :  in its power to prevent genocide, that was another level in the international narrative for
*05:55.700- 06:01.260* :  hardening against Israel, the fact that the courts saw this conflict as able to be judged within
*06:01.260- 06:06.240* :  the genocide convention. So I think that, you know, we've seen obviously these huge protests
*06:06.240- 06:10.780* :  around the world. There have been obviously protests in favor of Israel against anti-Semitism,
*06:10.780- 06:15.580* :  but there have been many protests and perhaps even larger in favor of the Palestinians.
*06:15.580- 06:20.680* :  I think it is partly a generational thing. I think it is partly, you know, as the war grinds on
*06:20.680- 06:25.660* :  and the casualty figures saw and, you know, the Hamas run health ministry there, the local health
*06:25.660- 06:31.120* :  officials saying that more than 26,000 people have now died. International opinion has turned to
*06:31.120- 06:36.840* :  some extent against Israel. And so this is an opportunity for the Israeli government to bolster
*06:36.840- 06:41.600* :  its argument, and it's long-running argument that various bodies of the UN are kind of stacked
*06:41.600- 06:47.820* :  against it. That antipathy towards the United Nations and indeed towards other international
*06:47.820- 06:54.100* :  organizations is that an Israeli government thing or more widespread amongst the population.
*06:54.500- 07:00.060* :  It's certainly within the government and there, you know, the UN is a kind of useful punching bag
*07:00.060- 07:05.560* :  that is frequently deployed by the Israeli government, especially at the moment, but you do hear
*07:05.560- 07:11.840* :  it among ordinary Israelis, if we can use that term. It is a difficult one because Israelis get a
*07:11.840- 07:19.480* :  diet of information from Israeli TV that is to some extent quite different from what is being
*07:19.480- 07:25.400* :  told in the international media. Israelis are receiving a lot of pictures and reading a lot about
*07:25.400- 07:29.900* :  their hostages, of course, which is a national trauma, and they're not seeing that much about the
*07:29.900- 07:36.920* :  suffering of garsens in this war. So that does shape their view of, you know, when the UN criticizes
*07:36.920- 07:41.300* :  Israel, Israel for alleged war crimes, etc. It is something that you hear on the streets. It is
*07:41.300- 07:47.400* :  something that you hear from Israelis of different sides, and it is quite deeply felt. And that said,
*07:47.400- 07:52.120* :  Israel also invokes the UN frequently when it feels that the UN is bolstering, it is agreeing
*07:52.120- 07:58.380* :  with it. So it's a complicated picture. Mark Lohan in Jerusalem. The United States is asking for
*07:58.380- 08:04.360* :  quite a big favor from China. It wants Beijing to use its influence with Iran to reign in the
*08:04.360- 08:09.680* :  Houthis. The Yemen-based Shia group is armed and supplied by Iran, and has recently been
*08:09.680- 08:14.780* :  launching attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea. On Friday, a missile fired by the Houthis
*08:14.780- 08:20.420* :  hit an oil tank of the Marlin-Lawander causing a major fire. A world affairs correspondent Paul
*08:20.420- 08:26.240* :  Adams reports. The Marlin-Lawander is the latest in a growing list of commercial ships attacked by
*08:26.240- 08:32.280* :  the Houthis, carrying Russian oil from Greece to Singapore. A fire raged in a cargo tank all night,
*08:32.280- 08:38.480* :  but is now out. According to the Singapore-based multinational Trafigura, the crew is unharmed,
*08:38.740- 08:43.320* :  and the ship on its way to a safe harbor. The company thanked the Indian, American, and French
*08:43.320- 08:50.620* :  navies for their support. The Houthis were quick to take credit for attacking the tanker,
*08:50.880- 08:55.020* :  their military spokesman saying, once again, that this was being done to support the
*08:55.020- 09:00.100* :  Palestinians in Gaza, and in response to what he described as American British aggression.
*09:00.640- 09:05.620* :  Here, the Defense Secretary Grant Shaps called the attack intolerable and illegal. The UK,
*09:05.620- 09:10.960* :  he said, remained committed to protecting freedom of navigation. It's been two weeks since Britain
*09:10.960- 09:17.220* :  and the US first hit back, striking military targets inside Yemen, aiming to deter the Houthis.
*09:17.540- 09:22.700* :  So far, the strategy doesn't appear to be working. Marco Forgeoni is Director General
*09:22.700- 09:28.520* :  at the Institute of Export and International Trade. The area that the Houthis have been
*09:28.560- 09:34.680* :  attacking has expanded from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Asia, and the types of attacks that we're
*09:34.680- 09:40.200* :  seeing has increased. Initially, it was drone attacks. Now we're seeing cruise missile attacks.
*09:40.200- 09:45.920* :  Yesterday's attack was a ballistic missile. We're seeing the weaponization of supply chains.
*09:45.920- 09:51.660* :  The United States has now asked China to use its influence with Iran to help rein in their allies
*09:51.660- 09:55.780* :  in Yemen, but the Houthis appear to be relishing this confrontation with the West,
*09:55.780- 10:02.500* :  something they've thought about and planned for years. Paul Adams. Saturday was Holocaust
*10:02.500- 10:08.200* :  Memorial Day, marking the day Soviet forces liberated the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp
*10:08.200- 10:14.660* :  in 1945. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Schultz urged his countrymen to continue the fight against
*10:14.660- 10:23.840* :  anti-Semitism and other forms of racism. Our democracy has millions of faces. Our
*10:23.840- 10:31.360* :  never again has millions of voices. The 27th of January calls out to us, stay visible, stay
*10:31.360- 10:39.020* :  audible against anti-Semitism and against racism and against misanthropy and in favor of our
*10:39.020- 10:44.660* :  democracy. With the passing years, the number of Holocaust survivors is becoming ever smaller.
*10:44.660- 10:50.100* :  We can hear briefly now from two of them. Hannah Lewis first, Hannah, was born to a Jewish family
*10:50.100- 10:57.400* :  in Poland in 1937. As a child, she survived years of hunger and bitter cold in a Nazi labor camp.
*10:57.400- 11:02.760* :  Most of her relatives, including her mother, died. She says it's vital that the last remaining
*11:02.760- 11:07.860* :  witnesses continue to tell their story, especially to today's younger generation.
*11:08.440- 11:14.460* :  It's very important that they see a survivor because you can begin to think that it's a different
*11:14.460- 11:21.180* :  sect of people and they meet us and they see us and where the same is everybody else good, bad and
*11:21.180- 11:28.000* :  indifferent. Human nature doesn't change. There we good people, bad people, bullies,
*11:28.840- 11:33.820* :  comforters, clever, stupid, and prejudiced.
*11:34.580- 11:40.300* :  84-year-old Peter Lantos was born in Hungary. In 1944, he was sent with his family to the
*11:40.300- 11:45.500* :  Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where his father and many of his relatives died.
*11:45.980- 11:49.360* :  Holocaust Memorial Day, he says, has lost none of its significance.
*11:50.080- 11:58.240* :  Today, I think, is important because it makes it widely known what happened, not only people
*11:58.240- 12:05.940* :  who had been there, but the general population. Personally, I find to talk about it is easier.
*12:06.500- 12:13.960* :  It was very difficult at the beginning, but then I realized that it is a moral obligation to do
*12:14.760- 12:22.080* :  because there are fewer and fewer people around who can say I was there. Even if you say that
*12:22.160- 12:31.500* :  in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century, six million people had been murdered,
*12:32.220- 12:40.920* :  planned ahead of time. That is very difficult to believe. It is a shame that the war is associated
*12:40.920- 12:49.740* :  with what happened in the past. And that is an entirely different political matter from the Holocaust.
*12:50.740- 12:53.580* :  Peter Lantos, and before that, we heard from Hannah Lewis.
*12:55.360- 12:59.280* :  One victim was killed. When she went to meet a man, she'd met through a dating app.
*12:59.380- 13:04.780* :  Another was strangled, with her remains stuffed into a plastic bag. These are just some of the
*13:04.780- 13:10.120* :  murders committed against women in Kenya this year. And on Saturday, there were demonstrations
*13:10.120- 13:15.120* :  in major Kenyan cities protesting against the rising tide of violence towards women.
*13:15.640- 13:18.200* :  Africa Regional Editor Will Ross reports.
*13:23.680- 13:27.080* :  They took to the streets to express outrage at the recent murders of women.
*13:27.580- 13:31.540* :  In one case this month, the 20-year-old student was strangled and dismembered.
*13:31.800- 13:35.780* :  Another woman in her 20s was fatally stabbed by a man she just met online.
*13:36.340- 13:39.740* :  While these gruesome cases made the news headlines and caused shock,
*13:39.740- 13:44.880* :  the demonstrations in several Kenyan cities would focus people's attention on the deep-rooted
*13:44.880- 13:50.060* :  problem of gender-based violence. More than a third of women who took part in a survey a couple of
*13:50.060- 13:55.460* :  years ago said they'd experienced physical violence. Court cases are rare and extremely slow
*13:55.460- 14:00.100* :  moving. Kenyan women are calling on the authorities to do more to ensure they're safe.
*14:00.460- 14:06.580* :  The government has an obligation to respect, to protect, to promote and to fulfill human rights.
*14:06.740- 14:12.820* :  It is obligation of the government. So the government must tell us what they have done.
*14:13.660- 14:18.420* :  In fact, the government must apologize to women.
*14:19.780- 14:23.640* :  On social media, many are quick to question the motives of the women who were targeted.
*14:24.240- 14:28.400* :  Why had they agreed to meet the men? Others are questioning their morals and commenting on the way
*14:28.400- 14:33.580* :  the women dress. Out on the streets today, protesters denounced this victim-shaming and held
*14:33.580- 14:40.700* :  placards with a blunt message, stop killing women. Will Ross. Now to the Netherlands, she was
*14:40.700- 14:45.200* :  suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome and friends of the young women say she's now been
*14:45.200- 14:50.880* :  helped to die by euthanasia. The condition had left Lauren Herva with what she described as
*14:50.880- 14:56.560* :  all-encompassing exhaustion. If the Netherlands anyone can make an application for euthanasia,
*14:56.980- 15:01.980* :  but strict rules apply and there are several rounds of assessment that must be done by medical
*15:01.980- 15:07.040* :  experts to make sure all the criteria have been met. Our correspondent in the Netherlands and
*15:07.040- 15:12.380* :  a hologant reports. 28-year-old Lauren Herva builds up a large public following,
*15:12.380- 15:18.480* :  sharing health updates and rare excursions on her brain fog blog. People replied from all over
*15:18.480- 15:24.420* :  the world with messages of encouragement, support and also cat content for the self-described
*15:24.420- 15:31.120* :  stay-at-home catparent. Assisted dying has been legal in the Netherlands for more than a decade.
*15:31.120- 15:39.520* :  In 2022, there were 8,720 reported cases, the highest number to date. A majority of them
*15:39.520- 15:45.900* :  were cancer patients, while there was also an increase in those citing dementia. Five people
*15:46.040- 15:51.880* :  under the age of 30 were also euthanised, which is attracted criticism from some doctors.
*15:52.820- 15:58.200* :  Under Dutch law, people who want to be allowed to die must be experiencing unbearable suffering
*15:58.200- 16:05.620* :  with no prospect of improvement. Lauren Herva invited her loved ones to watch a farewell live stream.
*16:05.620- 16:09.900* :  In her last blog post, Lauren shared words of advice she would have liked to receive,

*16:16.640- 16:20.360* :  In a final social media post shared just a few hours before her death,

*16:57.960- 17:05.040* :  to root out communism in Hollywood. It's a story of glamour and scandal and political intrigue
*17:05.600- 17:12.460* :  and a battle for the soul of a nation. Hollywood Exiles from CBC podcasts and the BBC World

*18:25.560- 18:31.380* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now to the United States and say what she like about
*18:31.380- 18:37.240* :  Nikki Haley, the Republican Party's presidential hopeful, she seems determined not to give up
*18:37.240- 18:43.360* :  without a fight, despite a crushing defeat in the Iowa caucus. And quite a whipping in New Hampshire,
*18:43.860- 18:48.380* :  Ms. Haley has refused demands from some quarters that she withdraw from the contest.
*18:48.380- 18:53.440* :  Donald Trump himself wants her out of the way, leaving him to get on with a business of
*18:53.440- 18:58.900* :  campaigning to win the presidential election itself. But in a post on X, formerly Twitter,
*18:59.400- 19:04.820* :  Nikki Haley has hit back, saying that Mr. Trump's latest legal battles are a distraction from
*19:04.820- 19:10.560* :  policy issues. We're not talking about fixing the border. We're not talking about tackling inflation,
*19:10.560- 19:17.140* :  she wrote. America could do better than Donald Trump and Joe Biden. So what's her strategy?
*19:17.140- 19:22.440* :  I spoke to the BBC's Will Vernon, who's in Washington, and asked him first whether Ms. Haley had
*19:22.440- 19:27.600* :  now in effect decided to give as good as she gets. Well, in the early stages of the race, Paul,
*19:27.600- 19:34.480* :  she was quite careful, I think, not to criticize Donald Trump too harshly, or perhaps too directly.
*19:34.520- 19:39.860* :  Probably because she didn't really want to alienate people at that early stage before she'd
*19:39.860- 19:45.140* :  built up a base of supporters. But now, of course, she's the last woman standing, the last major
*19:45.640- 19:50.080* :  candidate still in the race. So you maybe get the impression that she has a bit less to lose,
*19:50.080- 19:55.400* :  perhaps. Now, she has stepped up her attacks on the former president in recent days. And her
*19:55.400- 20:00.860* :  strategy has been to kind of compare Mr. Trump to Joe Biden. She said that both of these men
*20:00.860- 20:07.560* :  are of advanced age. They're both mentally unfit to be president in her opinion. And she's
*20:07.760- 20:13.460* :  been keen to kind of emphasize the grievances and the ongoing investigations that both of them
*20:13.460- 20:17.400* :  have saying that this is basically a distraction. And that's what she's done here, I think.
*20:17.400- 20:22.420* :  She said, instead of talking about immigration or inflation, we're talking about 83 million
*20:22.820- 20:26.800* :  those are the damages that Donald Trump has to pay in this case. So of course, he has said that
*20:26.800- 20:32.300* :  he will appeal. You know, I think observers from outside often find it rather strange that in
*20:32.300- 20:37.760* :  American politics, candidates from the same side often trash each other pretty heavily. I mean,
*20:38.180- 20:43.660* :  assuming Donald Trump does get to be the Republican candidate, what do you think the effect will
*20:43.660- 20:47.960* :  be on the election itself that there's been this pretty heavy punch up with his rival?
*20:48.340- 20:53.220* :  Well, I don't think it'll have a huge effect, frankly. I mean, barring an earthquake or perhaps
*20:53.220- 20:57.840* :  the political equivalent of something like a meteor hitting the earth and wiping us all out.
*20:57.840- 21:02.240* :  I think Donald Trump will almost certainly be the candidate for November's election.
*21:02.620- 21:06.960* :  You know, unexpected things do happen, of course, but almost all of the political pundits here say
*21:06.960- 21:13.040* :  that the Republican party is now his party. It's the Trump party. He has a huge lead in the polls.
*21:13.180- 21:17.820* :  And I think soon the focus will be very much on Trump versus Biden, you know, on the election and not
*21:18.340- 21:22.640* :  Trump versus Haley. And of course, there's a huge number of issues to discuss in that election,
*21:22.640- 21:27.600* :  immigration at the southern border, foreign policy, crime, all sorts, the threat of democracy,
*21:27.600- 21:32.820* :  right? Because both Trump and Biden say the other is anti-democratic. Trump says Biden has
*21:32.820- 21:38.220* :  weaponized the justice system. And Donald Trump, of course, has said he would be a dictator on day one,
*21:38.220- 21:42.860* :  has threatened to pursue his political opponents in office, is accused of trying to stay in power
*21:42.860- 21:46.460* :  after losing the 2020 election. I mean, the list goes on.
*21:47.080- 21:52.160* :  We'll turn it in Washington. The U.S. is warned that it could restore sanctions on Venezuela
*21:52.160- 21:57.760* :  after the country's top court disqualified the opposition leader from running for president this year.
*21:58.340- 21:59.100* :  Warren Bull reports,
*21:59.760- 22:03.360* :  In October, President Maduro's government signed an agreement with the opposition,
*22:03.360- 22:09.320* :  promising to hold free elections by the end of 2024. In response, the Biden administration
*22:09.320- 22:15.480* :  eased economic sanctions on Venezuela. Soon afterwards, the opposition chose Maria Cardina Machado
*22:15.720- 22:20.240* :  as its candidate for president, despite an earlier ruling that she should be barred from public
*22:20.240- 22:25.580* :  office for alleged corruption. She denies the charge, but on Friday, Venezuela's Supreme Court
*22:25.580- 22:30.340* :  upheld that decision, prompting the U.S. State Department to say it was reviewing its deal with
*22:30.340- 22:37.460* :  Caracas. Now, what should be done about deep fake technology? That's fake images created by artificial
*22:37.460- 22:43.620* :  intelligence had often shared online, such images of Taylor Swift have now prompted calls from
*22:43.620- 22:49.040* :  leading U.S. lawmakers to criminalize their creation. The Taylor Swift pictures were viewed
*22:49.040- 22:54.840* :  tens of millions of times online, and its prompted further debate about whether social media
*22:55.340- 22:59.600* :  platforms should be held liable for the spread of deep fake. David Willis has more.
*23:00.360- 23:06.740* :  There was a bill put forward a short while ago, which would have imposed criminal penalties
*23:06.740- 23:11.880* :  against anyone found guilty of creating or distributing this sort of information, but it's
*23:11.880- 23:18.640* :  currently bogged down in Congress. And the hope is that the involvement in all this now of Taylor Swift
*23:19.240- 23:25.800* :  could in some way reinvigorate those legislative moves and those attempts to get some sort of laws
*23:26.260- 23:31.820* :  on the books. The White House said today that it was alarmed by the sexually explicit Taylor
*23:32.120- 23:38.600* :  Swift pictures, but the spokeswoman, Kareen John Pierre, appeared to concede that in the absence
*23:38.600- 23:44.300* :  of congressional action, there was really very little in this regard that the Biden administration
*23:44.300- 23:51.100* :  could do to help the situation. Now, for its part, the ex-platform has said that it is actively
*23:51.100- 23:57.360* :  removing these sexually explicit pictures. Taylor Swift's fans, otherwise known as Swifties,
*23:57.820- 24:03.120* :  are taking measures of their own. They've taken to the ex-platform under the hashtag
*24:03.120- 24:10.880* :  Protect Taylor Swift in a bid to distract attention from the sexually explicit images.
*24:11.580- 24:18.620* :  David Willis. Now, it's got room for 8,000 passages across 20 decks, more than 40 restaurants,
*24:18.620- 24:24.940* :  bars and entertainment venues, and even a 16-meter waterfall. The world's largest cruise ship,
*24:24.940- 24:30.980* :  the icon of the seas, has set off from Miami on its maiden voyage. But is that really room for
*24:30.980- 24:36.580* :  such excess in a world that faces drastic climate change, and where the emissions of sea vessels
*24:36.580- 24:42.020* :  are an increasing focus of concern? If our mental groups have criticised this ship in particular,
*24:42.600- 24:48.660* :  because it's powered by liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which emits harmful methane into the
*24:48.660- 24:53.780* :  atmosphere, but the ship's owners say that LNG is the most efficient fossil fuel available.
*24:54.480- 24:59.900* :  And the ship's chief engineer, Stig Erickson, insisted they really did pay heat to environmental
*24:59.900- 25:07.140* :  concerns. Sustainability is an important part of our journey to destination net zero in the future,
*25:07.340- 25:12.600* :  and LNG is one part of that step forward on that journey. So while we are approaching new
*25:12.600- 25:18.020* :  alternative fuel sources, LNG is one step of that, and we are working with the manufacturers to
*25:18.020- 25:24.600* :  develop their technology going forward. Once upon a time, miners used canaries to warn of a
*25:24.600- 25:30.520* :  gas leak if the little bird in its cage dropped dead. It was time to get out. Now, another bird
*25:30.520- 25:36.220* :  is being used to warn about climate change. As the planet gets warmer, the migration patterns of
*25:36.220- 25:41.220* :  sunbirds are changing. Cranes, for example, normally breed in Scandinavia in the summer,
*25:41.940- 25:46.560* :  but there's evidence that afterwards they're no longer making the long winter trip south to
*25:46.560- 25:50.400* :  Spain and Northern Africa. From France, Hesco Field has more.
*25:53.240- 25:58.780* :  Since time immemorial, the sight and sound of cranes moving south in winter in their massive
*25:58.780- 26:05.400* :  V formations has intrigued and thrilled. But today, these birds are no longer over-flying
*26:05.400- 26:09.240* :  Francis Wavalli in search of warmer climbs, but staying on.
*26:11.060- 26:16.360* :  Dawn is the best time to catch them, as they set out from roofs by the river to forage in
*26:16.360- 26:22.320* :  fields round about. Winters here are getting milder by the year. They're still food to be had.
*26:22.660- 26:26.700* :  So, if you're a crane, what is the point of traveling any further?
*26:27.460- 26:32.200* :  Ivante Boudre is an environmentalist working on and around River Lois.
*26:34.420- 26:40.140* :  When I was a boy, there were maybe 200 cranes here in winter. Now it's 8,000. The young ones that
*26:40.160- 26:44.480* :  come here with their parents never learn how to fly further south, so they don't pass it onto
*26:44.480- 26:51.540* :  their children and the numbers become exponential. The cranes fought for once,
*26:51.540- 26:56.180* :  French stopovers on their long journey to the south. On our thanks to global warming,
*26:56.180- 27:02.600* :  their final destination. The crane is one bird whose migration patterns have been affected by
*27:02.880- 27:09.360* :  climate change. Now we've come to western France, the Atlantic coast, to observe another big bird
*27:09.780- 27:16.000* :  that's increasingly spending its winters here. The stalk. The stalks, winter migration,
*27:16.000- 27:22.440* :  is even further than for cranes. It's the thousands of miles to Mali and Burkina Faso in Sub-Saharan
*27:22.440- 27:29.200* :  Africa. Most stalks still do it, but more and more are staying on here at the Married Dev Nature
*27:29.200- 27:34.540* :  Reserve. Some traveling just a short way from their nesting grounds, others not bothering to move
*27:34.540- 27:43.660* :  at all. In similar fashion, many ducks and waders that come here to the French coast in winter from
*27:43.660- 27:48.740* :  the Arctic are now present in much smaller numbers because they're finding food further north
*27:48.740- 27:55.440* :  in Belgium and the UK for example. None of this is necessarily bad for birds because migration
*27:55.440- 28:01.760* :  is in fact an extremely dangerous business. Stalks that don't migrate have higher survival rates
*28:02.080- 28:06.660* :  and there's more as Jeremy Dupuis of France's bird protection league explains.
*28:08.100- 28:11.960* :  Birds that spend the winter near their place of reproduction will tend to breed early as the birds
*28:11.960- 28:17.000* :  who migrate and birds that breed early tend to have more babies so there is a clear advantage to
*28:17.000- 28:25.140* :  not migrating. The danger these birds is that even in milder winters there are still cold snaps
*28:25.140- 28:30.800* :  and when they happen up north they're killers. But the overall picture is not necessarily
*28:30.800- 28:37.340* :  depressing. Birds are showing they can change behaviour to live with changing temperatures. They are
*28:37.340- 28:46.820* :  adapting. Huseko Field Reporting. Sparrow thought for Luxembourg, the tiny European country is
*28:46.820- 28:52.620* :  less than 100 kilometers from north to south. Driving through from Belgium to Germany, you might
*28:52.620- 28:58.560* :  fail to notice it, but there is one area in which this nation used to punch well above its weight.
*28:59.220- 29:05.300* :  It traditionally performed very well in the Eurovision Song Contest and now after a 30-year absence
*29:05.300- 29:10.860* :  Luxembourg is returning to this musical battle. On Saturday evening it shows the song that it
*29:10.860- 29:14.280* :  hopes will bring it victory once again. Here's a taster.
*29:23.960- 29:29.680* :  That's Tali with her song Fighter. Well I spoke to the BBC's Daniel Rosni who was at the event
*29:29.680- 29:35.260* :  and asked why Luxembourg always did so well in Eurovision and whether he thought Tali would
*29:35.260- 29:39.680* :  continue the tradition. Well for a small country you're right it does punch above its weight.
*29:39.720- 29:45.440* :  Now Luxembourg has won Eurovision five times. It's only been beaten by Ireland and Sweden,
*29:45.980- 29:52.220* :  which have both won it seven times, but Luxembourg has had that 31-year absence. Now the
*29:52.220- 29:56.580* :  Eurovision Song Contest doesn't actually take place until May, so we've got Tali. She's the
*29:56.580- 30:02.160* :  entrance for Luxembourg. We've also got around six other songs of this year's bunch. There's
*30:02.160- 30:07.220* :  a 37 in total. So right now it's definitely one of the most talked about, but that's because it
*30:07.220- 30:14.920* :  literally just happened about half an hour or so ago. Now less than 700,000 people live in Luxembourg
*30:14.920- 30:20.400* :  and the broadcaster reckoned that more than half of the population was going to be tuning in this
*30:20.400- 30:23.980* :  evening. I've just stepped out from the press conference. There's around 150 journalists that are
*30:23.980- 30:27.600* :  in there and they're obviously not all from Luxembourg. They've come from all over Europe and
*30:28.060- 30:32.920* :  around the world and the reason that Luxembourg decided to take part again in Eurovision is because
*30:32.920- 30:37.700* :  of Xavier Betel. He was the prime minister of Luxembourg up until October. He's now the deputy
*30:37.700- 30:43.340* :  prime minister. He's a huge Eurovision fan and he sort of proposed to the government that Luxembourg
*30:43.340- 30:48.220* :  should reenter Eurovision and he convinced the broadcaster here to take part again because it's a
*30:48.220- 30:53.000* :  broadcasting competition so they have to pay for it. And the reason he did that was because it
*30:53.000- 30:58.400* :  doesn't matter how big your country is in the Eurovision Song Contest. It's how good the song is.
*30:58.840- 31:03.960* :  And as I say, I'll have to find out who will win in the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden in May.
*31:08.340- 31:12.640* :  And that's it from us for now but there'll be a new addition of the Global News Podcast later.
