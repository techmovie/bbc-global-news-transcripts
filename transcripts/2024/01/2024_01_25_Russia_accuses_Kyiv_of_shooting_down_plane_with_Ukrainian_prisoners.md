*01:50.320- 01:56.580* :  Service. I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Thursday, the 25th of January, these are our main
*01:56.580- 02:01.420* :  stories. Russia has accused Kiev of shooting down a plane. It says it was carrying Ukrainian
*02:01.420- 02:06.760* :  prisoners of war on their way to an exchange. The Ukrainian military has not directly addressed the
*02:06.760- 02:12.360* :  claims. A senior UN official has accused Israel of displaying blatant disregard for the rules of
*02:12.360- 02:18.200* :  war in shelling a vocational training centre in southern Gaza. Nine people were killed and over
*02:18.200- 02:23.980* :  70 injured. Hundreds of thousands of workers in Argentina are observing a nationwide strike in
*02:23.980- 02:32.480* :  protest at present Javier Malie's economic reforms. Also in this podcast, we learned how to implant
*02:32.480- 02:38.160* :  an embryo into a surrogate mother. There are four major steps how to achieve a new northern way
*02:38.160- 02:44.220* :  to be born and this was the last but one. A glimmer of hope for one of the world's most endangered
*02:44.220- 02:53.100* :  big beasts. The fog of war refers to the uncertainty of what is happening on both sides of a conflict
*02:53.540- 02:59.540* :  where an enemy is and the state of its operations. It is made even more complex and potentially tragic
*03:00.120- 03:06.400* :  when prisoner exchanges are taking place. On Wednesday, Moscow accused Ukraine of shooting down a
*03:06.400- 03:12.760* :  military plane just inside Russia that it says was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on their
*03:12.760- 03:18.740* :  way to be exchanged for captured Russian soldiers. A video footage showed a plane descending rapidly
*03:18.740- 03:25.160* :  behind residential buildings followed by a huge fireball. Officials in Kiev have confirmed a
*03:25.160- 03:30.300* :  prisoner exchange was planned for Wednesday but that it didn't happen. Our Russia editor Steve
*03:30.300- 03:35.900* :  Rosenberg reports from Moscow. In southern Russia today, a military transport plane fell from
*03:38.400- 03:45.500* :  the sky. Good God, Criter Woman, who was filming on her mobile phone as a giant fireball rose from
*03:45.500- 03:52.260* :  the crash site. The wreckage of the illusion 76 was strewn across fields. Not only did Russia
*03:52.260- 03:58.880* :  accuse Ukraine of shooting down the plane, it claimed that on board were dozens of Ukrainian prisoners
*03:58.880- 04:08.920* :  of war on their way to a prisoner swab. A Russian military spokesman said that of the 74 people on
*04:08.920- 04:16.780* :  the aircraft, 65, were Ukrainian POWs. There were no survivors. Over at the Russian parliament,
*04:16.780- 04:23.160* :  MPs were quick to condemn Ukraine and to criticize those countries who have been supporting Kiev
*04:23.160- 04:29.500* :  through the war. But this is a war the Kremlin started, with President Putin's so-called
*04:29.500- 04:36.640* :  special military operation. Russia is using what happened today to try to discredit Kiev and to
*04:36.640- 04:42.880* :  portray the Ukrainian government as the aggressor in this conflict. But it began with Russia's
*04:42.880- 04:51.620* :  full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago. Meanwhile, amid the mutual accusations
*04:51.620- 04:58.160* :  between Russia and Ukraine, in a village near the crash site, there was a memorial service for the
*04:58.160- 05:05.980* :  dead, for the latest victims of this war. Steve Rosenberg. All right, the United Nations in New
*05:05.980- 05:11.720* :  York, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, blamed Ukraine and called for an urgent U.N. meeting.
*05:14.460- 05:21.520* :  The Ukrainian prisoners of war were being transported to the Belgrade region in order to conduct an
*05:21.520- 05:28.520* :  exchange that had been agreed between Moscow and Kiev. Instead, the Ukrainian side launched an
*05:28.600- 05:34.680* :  air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the airplane with a fatal strike.
*05:35.420- 05:39.200* :  Well, the U.N. Security Council meeting regarding the Russian military plane crash
*05:39.740- 05:45.180* :  is scheduled for later on Thursday. I've been speaking to Vitaly Shchevchenko, the Russia editor
*05:45.180- 05:51.900* :  of BBC Monitoring and asked him, what does Ukraine been saying? It seems that Ukraine is moving
*05:51.900- 05:59.340* :  towards an acknowledgement that it may have downed that plane with Ukrainian prisoners of war
*05:59.980- 06:07.420* :  on board. The military intelligence directorate is so far the only government department that's
*06:07.420- 06:13.760* :  been commenting on this today. And while in the latest statement, they said that they don't know
*06:14.220- 06:21.480* :  who exactly was on board that plane. They also said that Russia normally tells Ukraine that there's
*06:21.480- 06:26.960* :  a plane with Ukrainian prisoners of war flying in that direction at this time. But in this occasion,
*06:26.960- 06:34.140* :  Russia did not warn Ukraine. And the military intelligence directorate says that this was
*06:34.140- 06:42.100* :  possibly deliberate. And that's how Russia put the lives of Ukrainian prisoners at risk. So this
*06:42.100- 06:49.500* :  isn't exactly an acknowledgement that it was Ukraine that did it, but it's pretty close to it.
*06:49.820- 06:54.760* :  Given the number of missiles that come out of that area of Russia and hit Ukraine,
*06:55.700- 07:02.280* :  you'd expect Ukraine to be particularly nervous about anything flying in that Belgrade area,
*07:02.280- 07:07.920* :  wouldn't you? Well, that's correct. And there was another statement issued by Ukraine today,
*07:07.920- 07:15.900* :  by the Ukrainian general staff, it didn't specifically mention or refer to this incident.
*07:16.820- 07:24.240* :  But it seemed to hint at it. It said that Ukraine will continue to monitor the roots that the
*07:24.240- 07:31.740* :  Russians take to deliver munitions to their forces in Ukraine. So that's an indication of how
*07:31.740- 07:38.500* :  nervous Ukraine is about aircraft flying in that area. Briefly vitally, obviously, it's
*07:38.560- 07:44.040* :  embarrassing and painful for Kiev if indeed this was the case. It's not going to lose it any
*07:44.040- 07:50.940* :  support amongst Ukrainians, though, is it? Well, no, a similar incident in the past, for example,
*07:50.940- 07:57.880* :  when Ukraine was accused of accidentally firing a missile, a market in the east of the country,
*07:57.880- 08:04.220* :  for example, the public consensus that I've been able to detect on social media said,
*08:04.220- 08:09.240* :  well, ultimately, it's Russia that started this war, so it's to blame. And mistakes happen.
*08:09.240- 08:14.080* :  So maybe this is what's going to happen this time. Vitaly Shevchenko, the Russia editor of BBC
*08:14.080- 08:21.620* :  Monitoring. NATO has launched its biggest military exercise since the Cold War, with 90,000
*08:21.620- 08:27.440* :  troops deployed to counter an imaginary invasion from Russia. The alliance says the operation
*08:27.440- 08:32.700* :  steadfast defender would demonstrate NATO's unity and strength. Paul Moss reports.
*08:33.660- 08:39.040* :  It's certainly one way to send a message. An entire armada of American troops is currently bound
*08:39.040- 08:45.120* :  for Europe. There, it'll join a rehearsal for what NATO would do. Should Vladimir Putin demonstrate
*08:45.120- 08:50.920* :  ambitions beyond just invading Ukraine? But there are political overtones to this exercise.
*08:50.920- 08:56.700* :  steadfast defender takes place amidst concern in parts of Europe that Donald Trump will win the
*08:56.700- 09:02.340* :  US presidency, having previously suggested that America would not come to Europe's aid in the
*09:02.340- 09:09.160* :  event of an attack. NATO says this exercise shows the alliance's determination to protect each other.
*09:09.580- 09:13.680* :  Paul Moss. To Gaza now, and a senior UN official has said,
*09:13.680- 09:18.500* :  Israeli shelling of a vocational training center in the territory, the Kilt-9 people,
*09:18.500- 09:24.360* :  showed a blatant disregard for the rules of war. Philip Ladsarini, head of the UN
*09:24.360- 09:30.680* :  Agency for Policy and Refugees, said the center was clearly marked. 800 people had taken refuge
*09:30.680- 09:36.860* :  in the building, which was hit by two Israeli tank rounds. Another UN official said teams
*09:36.860- 09:41.940* :  were trying to reach the site, but were stopped by an earth bank put up by the Israeli army.
*09:42.540- 09:49.900* :  It was a UN building inside a UN compound managed by my staff, and it was providing protection
*09:49.900- 09:55.460* :  for civilians. In and around this facility, there were 40,000 people seeking shelter
*09:55.860- 10:02.220* :  in this building, alone there were 800 people, and these people are civilians and should be protected.
*10:02.920- 10:06.680* :  So what's the view from Israel? Our correspondent Mark Loen is in Jerusalem.
*10:07.260- 10:14.180* :  Israel says that it is targeting terrorists in its words, and that Hanyunis is the center of terror
*10:14.180- 10:19.440* :  really, because they believe that that is the place where which is harboring top Hamas officials,
*10:19.440- 10:26.080* :  including the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yaya Sinwa, who is from Hanyunis, and who the Israelis
*10:26.080- 10:31.280* :  believe is sheltering somewhere in or beneath that city. It is the largest city in southern Gaza,
*10:31.640- 10:35.220* :  and it contains hundreds of thousands of people still. The Israeli authorities have issued
*10:35.220- 10:40.820* :  an evacuation order for about three districts that are thought to hold more than half a million
*10:40.820- 10:46.960* :  people, and there's very intense fighting now around at least three hospitals. The aid agency
*10:46.960- 10:50.900* :  Mid-Sans al-Hontia doctors with our borders says that in one of the hospitals, the largest one
*10:50.900- 10:56.180* :  in that area, 850 patients and staff, and thousands more sheltering in the grounds of the hospital
*10:56.180- 11:01.080* :  are trapped because of the fighting. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:01.600- 11:07.560* :  in the Knesset today has reiterated his stance about the operation in Gaza. Let's hear what he
*11:07.560- 11:14.680* :  had to say. We define the objectives of the war, and they are still existing, to topple the
*11:14.680- 11:20.900* :  Hamas regime, to bring back home our hostages, all of them, and to secure that Gaza will no longer
*11:20.900- 11:27.960* :  pose a threat on Israel. There is no compromise and won't be, in what relates to the security of our
*11:27.960- 11:36.360* :  existence and future for generations. So no compromise there from the Israeli Prime Minister. You
*11:36.360- 11:40.860* :  mentioned there are a lot of Hamas, according to Israel, a lot of Hamas officials still in the
*11:40.860- 11:45.800* :  southern part of Gaza. It's going to require an awful lot more people on the ground, one
*11:45.800- 11:51.620* :  imagines, because the air strikes don't seem to be getting the desired effect from the Israelis.
*11:52.080- 11:56.880* :  Yeah, I mean, it's complicated because the Israelis had unmuted the idea that they were going to
*11:56.880- 12:01.840* :  stop sort of the large-scale operations and move more towards a tactical phase of smaller-scale
*12:01.840- 12:06.520* :  attacks, but they still haven't captured or killed any top Hamas officials inside Gaza itself.
*12:07.260- 12:12.720* :  And three and a half months into this war, the majority of Israelis are still behind the
*12:12.720- 12:17.840* :  military campaign, but there is growing anger from the families of the remaining Israeli hostages,
*12:17.840- 12:24.180* :  who are still not back, to prioritize their release. There is a small but growing anti-war movement
*12:24.180- 12:29.320* :  here. There's a lot of pressure on Netanyahu from Israel's western allies to ease the military
*12:29.320- 12:33.320* :  offensive. And I mean, at some point, the Israeli government is going to have to say,
*12:33.320- 12:37.800* :  we've made enough progress to pull out. And at the moment, all they've kind of got to show for the
*12:37.980- 12:43.320* :  progress is the release of 100 hostages back in November and sort of pummeling Gaza to the ground.
*12:43.320- 12:48.620* :  But in the eyes of the west of the international community, really, Israel is sowing the seed of
*12:48.760- 12:53.420* :  hatred for generations to come, and there is still no viable plan for the day after what comes
*12:53.420- 12:59.960* :  after this Gaza conflict. Mark Loin in Jerusalem. Next to Argentina and tens of thousands of people
*12:59.960- 13:05.580* :  have protested outside Congress in the capital of Buenos Aires against radical economic reforms
*13:05.580- 13:11.940* :  proposed by President Javier Millet, who took office in December. Workers have also been staging
*13:11.940- 13:16.160* :  a 12-hour strike, which has affected public transport flights and other services.
*13:16.740- 13:20.620* :  James Menendez has been speaking to some of those taking part in the protests.
*13:27.860- 13:32.640* :  I came to support my country, Argentina, because they're putting it up for sale, and it's a shame,
*13:32.640- 13:37.840* :  but this government, this president of who I'm ashamed, is selling the country off bit by bit.
*13:38.520- 13:44.000* :  We're having a really bad time, and especially because of the prices. I'm retired, and I have nothing
*13:44.000- 13:49.000* :  left at the end of the month after paying my rent. Just a few coins. How am I supposed to do that?
*13:56.100- 13:59.860* :  Welcome, because I don't like the reform load that they want to pass in Congress.
*13:59.860- 14:05.840* :  The president, if you can call him that, does not represent me. He seems like a clown to me,
*14:06.040- 14:10.380* :  him and everything him and his team are doing. He is not my president.
*14:10.520- 14:15.840* :  Well, the strike action is the first real test for President Millet, who's only been office for
*14:15.840- 14:21.700* :  45 days. Most new leaders get a longer honeymoon period, don't they? But Mr. Millet is in a
*14:21.700- 14:26.740* :  hurry to get his plans pushed through Congress. The unions want to block them before they've even
*14:26.740- 14:32.280* :  got off the ground. James also spoke to Ektor Daer, leader of the General Confederation of
*14:32.280- 14:42.920* :  Workers, the main union umbrella group in Argentina. Because the decree put forward by the
*14:42.920- 14:46.840* :  government is an attack on workers' rights, and it's not just the decree that's damaging.
*14:46.840- 14:50.340* :  The government who's also presented a draft field that's very aggressive,
*14:51.060- 14:55.880* :  and could have important ramifications work as in Argentina that ultimately criminalizes union
*15:00.180- 15:04.500* :  action. And why now? Why are you calling this strike now? He's only been president for 45
*15:08.940- 15:12.360* :  days. Yes, it may be early, but it's all down to the government's aggression around this
*15:12.360- 15:17.120* :  urgent decree, which does not comply with the constitution. And it's also because of the bill
*15:17.120- 15:22.000* :  I mentioned earlier. Those were also early in abrupt actions which are taken without consulting
*15:22.000- 15:27.720* :  anyone, because this government does not talk to anyone. This government, in wanting the market
*15:27.720- 15:32.960* :  to regulate everything, what it really wants is to make the state disappear and with that workers
*15:32.960- 15:40.520* :  and unions rights. That was the union leader, Ektor Daer. But the truth is that there are millions
*15:40.520- 15:45.720* :  of people, 40 million in fact, who voted for Javier Millet, because they're fed up with inflation
*15:45.720- 15:50.060* :  and government waste and not just the wealthy people from all walks of life they can.
*15:50.720- 15:55.520* :  People are desperate as James has been finding out. We've come to a working class
*15:55.520- 16:00.180* :  neighbourhood, some distance from central Buenos Aires, and it's handsome architecture and
*16:00.180- 16:06.420* :  manicured parks. Here the grass grows long and the drab apartment blocks have seen far better days.
*16:07.060- 16:12.720* :  People here are struggling to make ends meet, with prices rising by more than a fifth every month.
*16:13.480- 16:17.960* :  Hello there, I'm James Ola, I'm a young Ola James, so I'm going to say Ola now.
*16:18.180- 16:23.540* :  People like Ola and Samir, a young couple in their early 20s with a daughter, Kiara, who's
*16:23.540- 16:28.720* :  just 18 months old. They live in a small flat with Samir's parents and his brother.
*16:29.280- 16:31.840* :  Ola tells me she's finding it hard to cope.
*16:33.540- 16:36.640* :  Every day we think about whether we're going to be able to pay the rent,
*16:38.380- 16:41.220* :  whether we're going to be able to pay the building service charge.
*16:42.580- 16:49.260* :  The bills. To that we have to add the food bill, transportation costs.
*16:53.580- 16:56.620* :  It's very difficult and you're constantly asking yourself,
*16:56.940- 17:00.900* :  am I going to make ends meet? What can I put back today is not the same as yesterday,
*17:00.900- 17:03.900* :  since everything is expensive, you're constantly worrying.
*17:05.580- 17:09.760* :  It's not just poor families that are suffering deeply because of this economic crisis.
*17:10.420- 17:15.880* :  Small businesses are really feeling the heat too. We've come to this small shop in Buenos
*17:15.880- 17:21.640* :  Aires to talk to the owner here and we've come to talk to him because a few years ago he had 12
*17:21.840- 17:28.520* :  of these small grocery shops. Now he has just two and it's not sure how much longer he can hold out.
*17:28.520- 17:36.240* :  Let's go and meet him. Cladio Bias is a man who believes in standing on his own two feet,
*17:36.240- 17:43.740* :  but years of sky high inflation and a dose of price gouging by wholesalers has devastated his
*17:43.740- 17:48.860* :  mini-empire of corner shops and he says time is running out.
*17:49.040- 17:55.680* :  I believe that if the economic problems continue for three more months, I'll be in trouble
*17:57.280- 18:01.620* :  and I'll not be able to cover the cost of electricity, salaries, taxes.
*18:02.900- 18:06.400* :  We've just come down the street a bit from Cladio's shop and there's a queue of people standing
*18:06.400- 18:14.220* :  by the road. There's a blackboard sign advertising eggs for sale. They're about $2, $2, $50 for
*18:14.220- 18:20.240* :  $24 X and there's a man who seems to be selling them out of the back of his car. Let's try and get a
*18:20.240- 18:26.340* :  word. Pablo, can I just ask you why are you selling like this?
*18:26.340- 18:33.420* :  Why are you selling like this? Because it's for a way to get the money from the day to day and get a
*18:33.420- 18:37.600* :  month of peace, the only way to get here, in Argentina.
*18:37.920- 18:41.360* :  Okay, is there any way that you can survive, the only way that you can make a living?
*18:41.540- 18:45.220* :  Do you make a lot of money this way, do you earn a lot of money selling like this?
*18:45.380- 18:52.160* :  No, I don't earn much. I earn a little bit to be able to buy again, keep me a little
*18:59.940- 19:03.920* :  bit of money to get to the end of the month and you can offer people in the neighborhood
*19:03.920- 19:08.220* :  a good price on. You're worried about the authorities. I mean, I imagine this isn't legal.
*19:08.220- 19:12.500* :  No se preocupa por la autoridad. Me imagino que no es legal, verdad?
*19:12.940- 19:17.380* :  No es legal. Sé que estoy en infracción. Es la única manera que tengo yo de ganarme la
*19:17.380- 19:22.520* :  plata hoy en día. No me puedo dedicar a otra cosa, pues no tengo bien mi pierna y la policía
*19:22.520- 19:27.120* :  gracias a Dios, no me molesta para nada. So the police don't bother you too much, but it's the
*19:27.120- 19:31.100* :  only way that you can make some money and you have had an accident on your motorcycle so you can't
*19:31.420- 19:34.420* :  it's hard of you to find work. Good luck, swervede, gracias.
*19:36.040- 19:42.400* :  It is a common refrain here. We've been doing whatever it takes to get by, but many people's
*19:42.400- 19:47.140* :  patients ran dry at the end of last year and so they've thrown in their lot with heavy
*19:47.140- 19:52.800* :  enemy lay who promised a radical departure from the left wing populism of the previous government,
*19:52.800- 19:58.960* :  wielding on the campaign trail an actual and a metaphorical chainsaw to big government.
*19:59.560- 20:02.740* :  Sé que el Bernstein is a well-known political analyst here.
*20:03.000- 20:08.280* :  The key question is whether what he's now proposing is the right thing to do in terms of the
*20:09.000- 20:14.460* :  speed of the adjustment. They want to basically have a balanced budget at the end of this year,
*20:14.960- 20:19.320* :  which means a fiscal consolidation process of about 5% or 2% of GDP.
*20:19.580- 20:23.520* :  And when you say fiscal consolidation means spending cuts basically or at least spending cuts
*20:23.520- 20:27.600* :  and putting up taxes. A more taxes, yeah. So it's great they want to, you know,
*20:27.600- 20:33.380* :  get rid of inflation, but I don't think the average Argentine understands how rough this is
*20:33.380- 20:39.860* :  going to be. James Menendez in Argentina. Still to come.
*20:40.340- 20:47.760* :  Boiling water, preferably fresh. I do use tea bags. I make it straight away. I use a mug.
*20:48.720- 20:52.280* :  I use skimmed milk. Not too much, no sugar.
*20:52.740- 20:57.040* :  But what's causing the transatlantic controversy? Tea leaves at the ready later.
*21:01.180- 21:04.300* :  This is the story of a powerful Nigerian televangelist.
*21:04.400- 21:09.540* :  He was a huge celebrity and had a way of presenting himself as man of God.
*21:09.720- 21:12.300* :  He attracted followers to his church from around the globe.
*21:12.560- 21:14.600* :  It was like going to heaven, being asked to stay.
*21:14.780- 21:20.900* :  But once there, some say that TV Joshua used his power to control, manipulate, and abuse.

*22:44.820- 22:50.100* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. In a country the size of China fires in buildings
*22:50.100- 22:54.240* :  a common, but few are as deadly as the one that's happened in the city of
*22:54.240- 23:00.280* :  Shinu in the south of the country. At least 39 people are confirmed dead. I heard more from our
*23:00.280- 23:05.800* :  China media analyst, Keri Allen. We know that this was in a building that had both the training
*23:05.800- 23:10.540* :  school and also in internet cafe, so that's why the death toll was so high because there were
*23:10.540- 23:16.960* :  lots and lots of people in this small space. It does seem that rescue efforts have now concluded,
*23:16.960- 23:22.160* :  so there is the thought that the death toll may not increase, but it is at the moment looking
*23:22.160- 23:26.720* :  in state media, it is the top story, and also on social media as well, a lot of people are talking
*23:26.720- 23:31.380* :  about this. Yeah, and an investigation has been announced at a very senior level of the
*23:31.380- 23:36.200* :  Communist Party indeed. I suppose that's a factor of the fact that it's a large number of people
*23:36.200- 23:41.500* :  died. And also as well, because President Xi Jinping has made comments in the past about how
*23:41.940- 23:46.560* :  when there are fires like this, and yes, lots of people dies, it really shines a light on health
*23:46.560- 23:51.880* :  and safety precautions that are in place at buildings in China, because in the past there have
*23:51.880- 23:55.800* :  been lots of buildings that have been thrown up very quickly, and they've not got fire exits,
*23:55.800- 24:01.480* :  they've not got ventilation, they've been built with the wrong infrastructure that's kind of
*24:01.480- 24:08.340* :  insulation within the building, that means that fires can spread very quickly, so many factors like
*24:08.340- 24:13.720* :  this can be taken into account. Now, even when there is blame for a fire like this, what happens
*24:13.720- 24:19.160* :  who tends to be held responsible? Is it small-time officials or or at a more senior level?
*24:19.480- 24:22.600* :  I mean, one of the messages that I've seen coming up quite a bit today on senior
*24:22.600- 24:27.180* :  Weibo, which is one of China's leading social media platforms, very similar to Facebook or
*24:27.180- 24:33.380* :  X, people saying that they're only hearing about this much later than when the incident happened.
*24:33.420- 24:38.740* :  I mean, even me, just monitoring state media, I didn't know about this until hours later that
*24:38.740- 24:43.760* :  this fire was taking place. It wasn't suddenly happening and there was lots of footage on social
*24:43.760- 24:48.500* :  media, so there might be criticism of this. Normally, these investigations, there are a lot of
*24:48.500- 24:53.400* :  people who could be held accountable, so yeah, if that's the case, this investigation could take
*24:53.400- 25:00.800* :  months. Carry Alan there. A British billionaire has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in
*25:00.800- 25:06.260* :  a man hat and court. Under the plea deal, Joe Lewis agreed to admit involvement in securities
*25:06.260- 25:11.960* :  fraud. Here's Michelle Flurry in New York. The former owner of Tottenham Hotspur's Joe Lewis said
*25:11.960- 25:17.500* :  he was so embarrassed and apologized to the judge as he pleaded guilty to insider trading and
*25:17.500- 25:23.600* :  conspiracy charges. The 86 year old billionaire businessman and investor was charged in July with
*25:23.600- 25:29.080* :  passing confidential information that he picked up in corporate boardrooms to his friends, pilots
*25:29.080- 25:34.960* :  and former lovers. This enabled them to make millions of dollars in profits. As part of the plea
*25:34.960- 25:40.440* :  deal with prosecutors, Broad Bay limited, which Mr. Lewis owns, will pay more than $50 million
*25:40.460- 25:47.500* :  in financial penalties. Michelle Flurry. Now to the world of tea drinking, which at times,
*25:47.500- 25:53.360* :  it seems, can set temperatures boiling. The U.S. Embassy in London has intervened in a brewing
*25:53.360- 25:58.980* :  controversy over a recommendation by an American academic, Professor Michelle Frankel, to add
*25:58.980- 26:04.720* :  salt to tea. In a statement, the embassy said the recipe for what was called the perfect
*26:04.720- 26:09.940* :  cup had landed, the so-called special relationship in hot water. It assured the people of
*26:09.940- 26:15.340* :  Britain that such a proposal would never be official U.S. policy. The recipe has caused an
*26:15.340- 26:22.140* :  outpouring of disbelief on British social media. James Reynolds spoke to Mira Manak, author of
*26:22.140- 26:28.200* :  The Book of Chai, and also Angela Grindley, a self-proclaimed tea addict, who drinks around six cups
*26:28.200- 26:36.360* :  a day. First Angela, what makes a perfect cup of tea? Boiling water, preferably fresh. I do use tea
*26:36.360- 26:46.340* :  bags. I don't let it stew. I make it straight away. I use a mug. I use skimmed milk. Not too much.
*26:46.340- 26:52.380* :  No sugar. I'm letting all that down. Definitely no salt. Have you, having heard that suggestion
*26:52.460- 26:59.020* :  about salt to take away the bitterness you attempted to try just once? I just thought, once I might,
*26:59.540- 27:04.180* :  but not thinking of its tea, but just to see what nurse she's talking about. I don't see how.
*27:05.100- 27:09.980* :  It sounds crazy. Americans put string on their tea bags. I'm not going to listen to them about this.
*27:10.540- 27:14.680* :  I feel we need to get messages now in from our American tea drinkers to make sure,
*27:14.680- 27:19.680* :  editorally, they have the right to apply on this. But before we do so, Mira, I do want to bring
*27:19.680- 27:24.620* :  you in. You've got your tea with spices at the moment. I want to get onto that recipe. Actually,
*27:24.620- 27:29.960* :  let's get onto that recipe now. What's your secret for a perfect cup? So Indians tend to boil their
*27:30.020- 27:34.060* :  tea, and that's the main thing. Putting it in a pot with tea leaves, half water, half milk,
*27:34.100- 27:39.780* :  unless it's the very, very skimmed milk or something very liquidy, in which case you can put full
*27:39.780- 27:45.660* :  milk, half water, half milk and tea leaves. And then some people add whatever ginger, cardamom,
*27:45.660- 27:49.860* :  some add cinnamon, some add a whole mix of spices or masala mix that they have at home.
*27:49.980- 27:55.220* :  Sometimes it's just boiled like that with no spices, a bit of sugar, and that's it. So it's really
*27:55.220- 28:00.320* :  how you prefer it, but I love having ginger and cardamom in mine, with some type of stuff up.
*28:00.540- 28:05.080* :  I would definitely take the cardamom. I want to bring back in Angela. I don't know if you were
*28:05.080- 28:10.960* :  able to hear all of the tea that Mira makes. That sounds pretty tasty. It does, but it sounds
*28:10.960- 28:17.640* :  like a spiced, fruity kind of tea. Normally I'm a traditionalist, so I'm just going for plain tea,
*28:17.640- 28:23.780* :  not adding any stuff into it. And making it more fun. So I don't know how you feel about
*28:23.780- 28:28.100* :  enforcing your own standards on others. So Angela, if you're going around someone's house
*28:28.160- 28:32.680* :  and they're making you a cup of tea, do you sort of hover around them, instruct to them how it
*28:32.680- 28:37.380* :  should be made? I know many friends of mine who do that, to my slight annoyance, or do you just
*28:37.640- 28:43.920* :  do you trust them? I trust them. I do say that actually people normally ask you how strong do you
*28:43.920- 28:50.240* :  want it, what kind of milk, maybe? So yes, I don't hover, but I would say not to plunge these.
*28:50.800- 28:54.840* :  Have you got any skimmed milk? The amount of times Angela, I've made cups of tea for people,
*28:54.840- 29:00.260* :  I know pretty well. And I see them then heading to the kitchen about one minute later to correct it,
*29:00.760- 29:05.000* :  to make it stew of it more, to add things. It always winds me up a little, but it shouldn't,
*29:05.100- 29:09.980* :  but it does what I say winds me up. But I always comment on it. It tea is very important. It tea is
*29:09.980- 29:16.040* :  part of life. And Mira, thinking about the salt in tea, you know the reason for that, take us
*29:16.040- 29:20.980* :  through it. So there are places in India, and just to go back to what Angela was saying, it's
*29:20.980- 29:26.200* :  definitely not through tea, it's just basically tea, normal cup of English tea, with spices added
*29:26.200- 29:30.500* :  to it, which is how Indians like it, or some Indians like it, some people don't like spices.
*29:30.920- 29:34.840* :  I love it with spices. It just makes it more spicy, and also enhances the health benefits.
*29:35.120- 29:40.060* :  In terms of the tea with salt, now that's still something I drink, or that I know anyone drinks,
*29:40.060- 29:45.660* :  but through the research that I did for my book, called The Book of Try, I did come across a lot of
*29:45.660- 29:51.300* :  people in Northeastern India, and in places like Sikkim and Ladakh, which are quite high
*29:51.300- 29:57.660* :  altitude, like to drink their tea with salt. Mainly in those areas, it's because they like to
*29:58.080- 30:03.520* :  keep themselves hydrated, and the higher you go in altitude, you get more dehydrated, and therefore
*30:03.520- 30:11.060* :  this provides extra hydration. Mira Manak, author of The Book of Try, and also Angela Grindley, a
*30:11.060- 30:18.520* :  self-proclaimed tea addict here in the UK. Milking the dispute further, the US Embassy in London also
*30:18.520- 30:23.760* :  joked that it would continue to make tea in the correct way by microwaving it.
*30:24.820- 30:30.900* :  Now, a hundred years ago, large groups of northern white Rhino used to roam across many parts of
*30:30.900- 30:36.540* :  central Africa. Today, poaching has brought them as close to extinction as it's possible to be.
*30:36.860- 30:41.120* :  There are only two of them left, and both are female, so time is running out.
*30:41.780- 30:46.360* :  But now, an international team of scientists has successfully implanted an embryo into one of
*30:46.360- 30:52.680* :  its near relatives, the Southern White Rhino. For the first time, proving that IVF is possible
*30:52.680- 30:57.380* :  in the species. Our science editor, Rebecca Morrell, explains what the scientists have done.
*30:58.240- 31:04.140* :  There are only two northern white Rhino's left. Nudgin and Fatu, a mother and daughter who live on
*31:04.140- 31:10.200* :  a reserve in Kenya, but now there is hope for the species. Scientists have managed to make IVF work
*31:10.200- 31:16.140* :  in a Southern White Rhino, the less endangered cousin of the northern whites. A Southern White Rhino
*31:16.140- 31:21.720* :  embryo created in a lab from sperm and an egg was implanted into a surrogate who fell pregnant.
*31:21.740- 31:26.480* :  Suzanne Holtzer, from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany,
*31:26.480- 31:30.620* :  says it's taken years and 13 attempts for this to reach this point.
*31:31.040- 31:35.740* :  It is really a great milestone to achieve the first successful embryo transfer in the rhino.
*31:36.040- 31:41.920* :  It's very challenging in terms of placing an embryo inside of the reproductive tract,
*31:41.960- 31:47.140* :  which is almost two meters inside of the animal. But now, I think with this achievement,
*31:47.140- 31:52.760* :  we are very confident that we will be able to create northern white Rhino's in the same manner.
*31:53.200- 31:56.960* :  The success, though, was hit by tragedy. Two months into her pregnancy,
*31:56.960- 32:02.880* :  the surrogate rhino died from an unrelated bacterial infection. But a post-mortem examination
*32:02.880- 32:08.920* :  revealed that her fetus had a 95% chance of being born alive, proof that the technique works.
*32:09.660- 32:15.040* :  The team now wants to attempt IVF using northern white rhino embryos, 30 stored in labs
*32:15.040- 32:20.580* :  in Germany and Italy, but there's a complication. Nudgin and Fatu, the last northern whites,
*32:20.580- 32:25.860* :  can't carry a pregnancy, so the embryos have to be implanted into a Southern White Rhino.
*32:26.460- 32:32.760* :  IVF across two subspecies has never been attempted before, but the team's confident it will work,
*32:32.760- 32:37.260* :  and they hope to try the procedure in the coming months. Rebecca Moral
*32:39.640- 32:44.380* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
