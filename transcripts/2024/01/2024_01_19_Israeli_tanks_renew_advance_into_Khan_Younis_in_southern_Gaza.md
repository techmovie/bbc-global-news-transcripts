*01:19.140- 01:22.440* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.700- 01:29.560* :  I'm Janet Gillil and a 14-hours GMT on Friday the 19th of January. These are our main stories.
*01:30.320- 01:36.540* :  As Israel continues to bombard southern Gaza, the Hamas-run health authorities say 140 Palestinians
*01:36.540- 01:41.920* :  have been killed. Pakistan's foreign minister says his government is prepared to work with Iran
*01:41.920- 01:47.040* :  on all issues after both countries attacked alleged militants on each other's soil.
*01:47.840- 01:53.740* :  A day after an aborted US attempt to land on the moon ended with a fiery descent into the Pacific
*01:53.740- 01:59.280* :  Ocean. It's a turn of a Japanese spacecraft to try to make a successful lunar landing.
*02:02.100- 02:02.920* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:11.140- 02:17.660* :  Madonna is being sued by two of her fans for starting her concert late when they had to get
*02:17.660- 02:26.460* :  up early the next day to go to work. We start in Gaza.
*02:29.020- 02:35.260* :  Where the southern city of Khan Yunus reverberated with gunfire,
*02:35.740- 02:42.520* :  as it again, came under heavy Israeli bombardment. The health ministry and Hamas-run Gaza says 140
*02:42.540- 02:48.880* :  people were killed and dozens wounded overnight, bringing the total number of people killed in Gaza
*02:49.380- 02:55.620* :  since the war started to nearly 25,000. Many civilians have fled the city,
*02:55.620- 03:01.500* :  others are taking refuge in crowded shelters where there's little access to food, water or
*03:01.500- 03:06.940* :  medical care. Israel says its forces have killed dozens of Hamas fighters in close quarters
*03:07.480- 03:12.660* :  combat, backed by tank and air support. We got more on the situation in Khan Yunus with our
*03:12.660- 03:18.820* :  Middle East region editor, Mike Thompson. Well, it's carrying on at an incredibly intense level,
*03:18.820- 03:25.380* :  as indeed the audio you've played just now makes quite clear. On Thursday, for instance,
*03:25.380- 03:30.780* :  we had in one house in Raffa, which is obviously south of where we're talking about, now 15 people
*03:30.780- 03:37.800* :  were killed in just a single strike on a house, and since then both ground combat and air strikes
*03:37.800- 03:44.520* :  have been continuing in Khan Yunus and making life extremely difficult for civilians there to find
*03:44.520- 03:50.260* :  anywhere to get out of the line of fire. Yes, because many of them have fled the city,
*03:50.480- 03:56.260* :  they've already been displaced many of them, and we know that the biggest hospital still operating
*03:56.300- 04:01.260* :  there, it saw many people fleeing there earlier this week because of this bombardment. So,
*04:01.620- 04:06.620* :  a really dire situation for all these displaced people. Yes, indeed, the Al-Nasa hospital that
*04:06.620- 04:12.900* :  referred to there, it's the biggest one that's still operational in the territory, and MSF,
*04:12.900- 04:17.920* :  the medical charity was saying there were bottoms raining around that yesterday, and the firing
*04:17.920- 04:22.820* :  you're still continuing very, very near it and many people have fled. So, and when you think
*04:22.820- 04:29.700* :  that's hardly any other operational hospitals left, it's a really dire situation. And at the same time,
*04:29.700- 04:34.800* :  we've had these warnings which are getting increasingly alarming from aid agencies about
*04:34.800- 04:41.140* :  possible famine in Gaza. That's right, yes, I mean, it's the problem which has been for a long
*04:41.140- 04:47.660* :  while now and getting enough aid into Gaza. Now, the Israeli government blames the UN, they say they've
*04:47.660- 04:53.860* :  not been very efficient at distributing it inside Gaza. The UN says, look, a lot of these trucks
*04:53.860- 04:59.680* :  that we want to get in have been inspected by Israeli officials, which has taken a long, long time
*04:59.680- 05:04.040* :  and held everything up, and sometimes they've refused permission. Plus, you've got all the firing
*05:04.040- 05:09.900* :  going on, which means that the shells fall, which means it's not safe for many deliveries to be made
*05:09.900- 05:14.520* :  at all. So, the Israeli government's blaming the UN, but I think the only crossing that the aid
*05:14.520- 05:19.680* :  can come in through is the one through Egypt at Raffa. There is one in Israel too, a Karim Shalom
*05:19.680- 05:24.560* :  crossing, which has been opened, but it's very spaz-modic as to what's getting in through there.
*05:24.560- 05:29.540* :  The main one, as you say, is there through Raffa, and it does require trucks to be able to move
*05:29.540- 05:34.360* :  through fairly quickly when we used to have say 500 a day coming in to keep the people fed.
*05:34.360- 05:40.060* :  And now, you know, it's a trickle, which is causing terrible hardship. And meanwhile, the Israeli
*05:40.060- 05:46.240* :  government is facing anti-war protests at home. Yes, indeed. We saw in Tel Aviv earlier today
*05:46.240- 05:52.640* :  200 people taking to the streets and demanding that to change timers running out. We need to get
*05:52.640- 05:57.880* :  the hostages back. We need to have a ceasefire. Now, the problem for Benjamin Netanyahu, the
*05:57.880- 06:03.380* :  prime minister, is he's in a difficult place because he has a very right-wing coalition cabinet
*06:03.380- 06:09.400* :  who want the war to continue at full pace. And his popularity in the polls is really, really
*06:09.400- 06:15.280* :  low. So he wants to try and get an outright victory, which he stated last night, in fact,
*06:15.720- 06:21.420* :  to try and recover his standing within the country or to get the hostages back. Neither is
*06:21.420- 06:27.820* :  going to be very easy. Mike Thompson, the two-state solution, which envisages the creation of the
*06:27.820- 06:33.280* :  state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel, has been at the core of efforts to try to resolve
*06:33.280- 06:39.100* :  the long-standing conflict in the past few decades. After repeated failures in U.S.-led
*06:39.100- 06:44.460* :  negotiations, the issue had fallen out of the international spotlight in recent years. But
*06:44.460- 06:50.120* :  the Hamas attacks in October have thrust it back, with Israel's biggest and staunchest ally,
*06:50.200- 06:56.300* :  the United States urging it to work towards creating a Palestinian state once the conflict in
*06:56.300- 07:03.180* :  Gaza is over. But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dashed any hopes by insisting
*07:03.180- 07:09.440* :  the war will continue for many more months until Hamas is destroyed. That sparked a sharp
*07:09.440- 07:14.820* :  response from the U.S., which said there could be no secure future for Israel without a two-state
*07:14.820- 07:22.600* :  solution. Meanwhile, on top of the huge loss of human life in Gaza, many of its institutions
*07:22.720- 07:30.480* :  have been destroyed, as we're a Davis reports. The impact of Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza
*07:30.480- 07:37.500* :  is astonishing. Its aim to completely crush Hamas has also destroyed or damaged more than half
*07:37.500- 07:44.880* :  of Gaza's buildings. And more than 24,000 people have been killed, says the Hamas run health
*07:44.880- 07:51.700* :  ministry. But the war has also laid waste too much of Gaza's infrastructure and civic society.
*07:53.460- 07:59.620* :  Israeli soldiers cheered when a UN school was blown up in the northern district of Bait Hanoon last
*08:00.060- 08:05.440* :  year. Ninety percent of educational buildings, universities and schools have been damaged or
*08:05.440- 08:12.040* :  destroyed, says the UN. The future for Gaza's young is bleak. Twenty-two-year-old Amir Muhammad
*08:12.040- 08:17.080* :  Al-Najar and his siblings have seen their dreams disappear in clouds of smoke.
*08:17.260- 08:22.820* :  And that command, yeah, my sister is studying in the third year of university at Al-Quds University.
*08:22.820- 08:28.160* :  It was bombed. My brother is in his final year of school at Khalid Rahman's school,
*08:28.580- 08:33.620* :  and it was also bombed. I have finished my degree in engineering. If there was no war,
*08:33.620- 08:39.180* :  I would have a job interview. I would have been accepted. And my brother, who is in the seventh grade,
*08:39.820- 08:42.720* :  is studying in the UN school. Nothing is left of it.
*08:46.220- 08:52.720* :  Like any society, Gaza's future is its children. Philippi Latsarini is the commissioner general
*08:52.720- 08:59.420* :  for UNRWA, the UN's refugee agency in Gaza. He says the territories children are losing out
*08:59.420- 09:06.900* :  completely and what should be rightfully theirs. How when we resume education, we have a population
*09:07.820- 09:15.800* :  in general deeply traumatized by this war, which has been a war of extraordinary intensity when
*09:15.800- 09:22.360* :  it comes to bombardment, but also to the impact on the Gaza society. And I'm afraid that
*09:22.360- 09:27.380* :  here we are taking the risk to lose a generation of children.
*09:27.780- 09:31.380* :  Kogat is the military division that coordinates Israeli government activities
*09:31.380- 09:37.180* :  in the occupied Palestinian territories. When I asked a senior Kogat official why it was
*09:37.180- 09:42.460* :  necessary to demolish an entire school after it had already been overrun by Israeli forces,
*09:42.940- 09:48.280* :  he replied that it was fact that Hamas cynically invades and uses civilian structures
*09:48.900- 09:53.040* :  like schools and hospitals from which to launch attacks against Israeli troops.
*09:55.600- 10:01.240* :  Gaza's health system too is broken. The World Health Organization says that only 13 of Gaza's
*10:01.380- 10:07.580* :  36 hospitals are functional, many damaged in their strikes. With shortages in basic medical
*10:07.580- 10:14.220* :  equipment, those who need treatment often go without, including Nisreen Abu Nimar, mother of two
*10:14.220- 10:19.080* :  who's already lost a child in this war and has had cancer since 2016.
*10:22.720- 10:27.680* :  I was receiving regular medical treatment for my cancer at the hospital here in Gaza,
*10:28.440- 10:33.440* :  but during the Israeli aggression, medical treatments have not been provided for the past four
*10:33.440- 10:39.480* :  months. Israel denies accusations of deliberately turning Gaza into a wasteland so people will have no
*10:39.480- 10:45.240* :  choice but to leave. Israel says it wants to allow in as much aid as the agencies can distribute
*10:45.780- 10:48.720* :  and it's not trying to demolish Gaza's civic structures.
*10:49.860- 10:56.000* :  That report by Wira Davis. President Biden has reiterated that US forces will continue to
*10:56.000- 11:01.260* :  carry out air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. Mr Biden acknowledged that the American
*11:01.260- 11:07.600* :  military campaign had failed to deter attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Another US
*11:07.600- 11:13.280* :  own tanker was hit by Houthi missiles on Thursday, but there was no damage. A Houthi official
*11:13.280- 11:19.660* :  insisted that the waters around Yemen were safe, so long as the passing vessels were not linked to
*11:19.660- 11:26.320* :  Israel and America. My colleague, Sasha Twining, has spoken to Captain Shirag, who's in charge of a
*11:26.320- 11:32.540* :  vessel that has just exited the Red Sea. At the moment, my vessel is in Gulf of Eden and
*11:32.540- 11:39.080* :  we are a mid-sized LPG tanker and we carry LPG, which is basically cooking gas. So this time we got
*11:39.080- 11:45.380* :  orders to discharge in Yemen. So since it is in Yemen, it's a very dangerous place. You must have
*11:45.380- 11:51.620* :  heard in the news that the US and UK Navy attacked some of the locations in Yemen. So one of the
*11:51.620- 11:57.680* :  location was quite close to our vessel. Around morning 6 o'clock, we could hear the sound of the
*11:58.280- 12:03.720* :  air strikes, the missiles and bombardments, and we could see the smoke. Now that we have exited the
*12:03.720- 12:08.120* :  area, now a company has told that, now no more going to Yemen because it's a dangerous place.
*12:08.500- 12:15.040* :  And can you tell me as much as you feel comfortable doing so, what extra security precautions you
*12:15.040- 12:20.580* :  have on board, whether that is extra staff or extra surveillance? Some companies they provide
*12:20.580- 12:26.280* :  armed guards for security. For our vessel, it was not so. They tried, but due to some reason,
*12:26.300- 12:31.920* :  they couldn't connect the security guards. So we went without security guards. Other than that,
*12:31.920- 12:38.400* :  we didn't had any security measures who have a good look out in case any board is approaching us,
*12:38.400- 12:44.580* :  if any drone or anything is approaching nearest. How does it feel for you now operating under
*12:44.580- 12:49.960* :  the circumstances that you've described? The situation is quite scary, it's dangerous actually.
*12:50.400- 12:55.240* :  While going to Yemen, you have to clear the United Nations inspection first in Djibouti.
*12:55.820- 13:01.280* :  So even those people, including people which I met in Yemen, they told that Yemen, the Houthi
*13:01.280- 13:07.060* :  rebels, they will not attack us because actually we are taking quite a big risk and we are doing a
*13:07.060- 13:12.500* :  favor on them. These ships which are going there, we are providing them LPG or anything else. So
*13:12.500- 13:16.400* :  they are very thankful for that. They are not going to attack us, but for the other vessels.
*13:17.140- 13:21.580* :  It is dangerous. They say they are attacking only vessels which has links to Israel,
*13:21.580- 13:26.020* :  but some errors are there. Some vessels which had no link, they also have been attacked.
*13:26.400- 13:31.760* :  So for me, hearing that I had some comfort, but you never know.
*13:32.240- 13:36.480* :  That was Captain Girag talking to us from his vessel in the Gulf of Aden.
*13:37.940- 13:41.840* :  Away from the Middle East, this week has seen a more surprising escalation of tensions
*13:42.240- 13:45.980* :  further east between two neighbours whose relations had been fairly cordial.
*13:46.520- 13:51.480* :  Thursday saw Pakistan launch missile strikes into Iran in response to Iranian strikes on
*13:51.480- 13:57.080* :  Pakistan two days earlier. Both sides said children had been killed by each other's attacks.
*13:57.860- 14:02.740* :  Now, as we record this podcast, Pakistan's foreign minister has said his country is ready to
*14:02.740- 14:08.260* :  work with Iran on all issues, and the Prime Minister is holding a national security meeting
*14:08.260- 14:13.840* :  to discuss the standoff with the Iranians. Our correspondent in Pakistan is Caroline Davis.
*14:14.800- 14:19.020* :  We are not certain at this stage what will be coming out of this security meeting. We know
*14:19.020- 14:23.860* :  that obviously it is a meeting of the top civilian leadership, the military leadership as well,
*14:24.440- 14:28.680* :  but Pakistan is not in a position where it would want to escalate things. It has made that very
*14:28.680- 14:34.340* :  clear in all the statements that it has made. It is not looking for a fight. Pakistan to give you
*14:34.340- 14:39.080* :  the backdrop has got political uncertainty and instability. We are in the run up to a general
*14:39.080- 14:43.780* :  election. The economy here is weak and there is already poor relations with, obviously,
*14:43.780- 14:48.700* :  historically India, but also at the moment there are increasingly difficult relationships
*14:49.600- 14:55.780* :  with Afghanistan neighbouring it as well. So it is not looking for a fight with Iran and Iran
*14:55.780- 15:01.240* :  for its part as well. When it condemned Pakistan's attack and the missiles that were fired into
*15:01.240- 15:08.180* :  its territory did condemn that attack but also talked about good naveliness and talked about how
*15:08.180- 15:13.000* :  it was important to not let terrorists get in the way of that and to, in fact, try to work together
*15:13.580- 15:18.160* :  as neighbours to make sure they could get rid of any terrorist threats. So that is the backdrop
*15:18.160- 15:23.820* :  to this. That has made many people feel hopeful that there will be some form of de-escalation
*15:23.820- 15:29.080* :  in that Iran and Pakistan will find a way of being able to deal with this through simply talking.
*15:29.080- 15:34.860* :  But as one analyst explained to me yesterday, given that the initial strike by Iran was so
*15:35.120- 15:39.580* :  unprecedented, everyone's a bit nervous about making any predictions about what it might do next.
*15:39.920- 15:45.100* :  And are you any clearer about why Iran carried out this surprise which did come as a big
*15:45.100- 15:50.840* :  surprise to many people? Iran in its statement of justifying why it did this, said this was all
*15:50.840- 15:56.720* :  about national security and they were targeting a militant group that they designate as a terrorist
*15:56.720- 16:03.600* :  organisation that they say are operating inside Pakistan's borders. Now Pakistan said that the
*16:03.780- 16:08.260* :  two children who were killed during this assault and the group that Iran was targeting said
*16:08.660- 16:13.440* :  that this was not where their headquarters were but instead it was the families of militants
*16:13.440- 16:19.000* :  that were killed during the course of this attack. But that's Iran's justification for why it did
*16:19.000- 16:23.560* :  this. Very similar to what Pakistan has said ultimately this looks like Iran trying to show a
*16:23.560- 16:27.800* :  display of power but maybe it might have stretched itself too far in a front that was previously
*16:27.800- 16:34.660* :  friendly. Caroline Davis. A day after an aborted US attempt to land on the moon ended with a fiery
*16:34.660- 16:40.040* :  descent into the Pacific Ocean. Another spacecraft is trying, as we record this podcast, to make a
*16:40.040- 16:46.440* :  lunar landing. This time the spacecraft belongs to Japan's Space Agency, it's known as Moon Sniper.
*16:47.040- 16:52.840* :  So far only about half of such missions have succeeded. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos told
*16:52.840- 16:57.560* :  us more about why Japan was joining other countries in trying to land on the moon.
*16:58.420- 17:05.060* :  There's a lot of science to be done still at the moon. It's a body that is essentially frozen
*17:05.060- 17:10.760* :  in time from early in the solar system. It's difficult to study the history of the solar system.
*17:10.760- 17:15.960* :  The planets are from Earth because the surface of the Earth is constantly remade. You'll know
*17:15.960- 17:21.780* :  about plate tectonics and volcanoes and all the rest of it. So the rocks around us here on Earth
*17:22.140- 17:29.180* :  are not really a true picture of what rocks look like way back when. And you go to places like
*17:29.180- 17:35.520* :  asteroids and the moon to get that sort of information. So that's why you do it. What they're trying
*17:35.520- 17:42.940* :  to do here is test precision navigation technologies. So we have very good maps of the moon's surface.
*17:42.940- 17:48.620* :  So they have maps of craters and they will be taking pictures as they go down and they will be
*17:48.620- 17:53.720* :  then cross-referencing with those maps trying to avoid the hazards and putting down safely.
*17:54.180- 18:00.120* :  But precision-wise they want to get within a hundred meters of the targeted point. And that's
*18:00.120- 18:06.080* :  important because if you're going to investigate these places, not just the moon but other bodies
*18:06.080- 18:12.040* :  in the solar system as well, you need to get close to the place that you want to study. Otherwise
*18:12.040- 18:18.160* :  once you get down you've then got to travel. And the space craft has got two rovers very different.
*18:19.300- 18:26.100* :  Yes these will be chucked off hopefully just before the lander puts down. One of them is a hopping
*18:26.100- 18:32.620* :  robot which I'd love to see that. The gravity on the moon is less than it is on Earth. It's a
*18:32.620- 18:38.080* :  smaller body. So I'd love to see that jumping up in the air. And the other one's quite interesting
*18:38.080- 18:44.120* :  as well. It's about the size of a baseball. It transforms its shape. When it needs to take a picture
*18:45.080- 18:50.280* :  it turns itself into a bit of a log and a camera comes out. It takes a picture. And interestingly
*18:51.020- 18:57.300* :  one of their companies involved in developing this particular robot is Tomi. And of course Tomi
*18:57.300- 19:03.220* :  brought us the transformers, the toys. And apparently there is a version of this probe that you can
*19:03.220- 19:08.740* :  buy here back on Earth, which you can roll around in your living room to take pictures of cats and
*19:08.740- 19:16.080* :  babies. It all fits together doesn't it? But I mean it gives you a sense of where Japan is in terms
*19:16.080- 19:21.540* :  of the technology that it thinks it can bring to this great effort to get back to the moon. The
*19:21.540- 19:27.280* :  Americans are determined to go back later this decade with the Artemis program and Japan will be
*19:27.280- 19:33.060* :  a key partner in that return along with Europe and Canada. Jonathan Hamas
*19:35.700- 19:42.780* :  Still to come in this podcast in South Africa. You're hearing audio from inside security
*19:42.780- 19:48.060* :  vans carrying money as they're deliberately rammed off busy daytime roads by cars.
*19:49.300- 19:52.640* :  The crime wave grows ahead of a key presidential election.
*19:58.840- 20:04.540* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Let's turn now to the growing insurgency in many parts of
*20:04.540- 20:11.880* :  Myanmar. Security officials in Northeastern India say about 270 Myanmar soldiers have crossed
*20:11.880- 20:17.700* :  into the state of Mizoram after fleeing an attack by rebels close to the border. Fighters from
*20:17.700- 20:23.720* :  the insurgent Arakan army have intensified their attacks on Burmese government forces in recent weeks.
*20:24.560- 20:28.800* :  My colleague Rob Young has been speaking to Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur,
*20:29.060- 20:34.040* :  on the situation of human rights in Myanmar about the significance of the latest unrest.
*20:35.120- 20:41.960* :  It is volatile. The opposition forces captured a strategically important town,
*20:41.960- 20:48.520* :  a Palitwa which is very close to the border with India and Bangladesh. It's the site of a
*20:48.520- 20:54.400* :  multi-million dollar transportation infrastructure project that's funded by India that will link
*20:54.400- 20:59.540* :  India's northern states with the region and with the Bay of Bengal. So it's strategically very
*20:59.540- 21:04.640* :  important, but it's also an important military location. It was headquarters, for example,
*21:04.640- 21:12.440* :  for the Hunta's light infantry battalion, the 289th light infantry battalion. So the Hunta in
*21:12.440- 21:18.940* :  losing Palitwa not only lost an important strategic territory, a very important location,
*21:19.820- 21:25.280* :  but also lost military assets, including weapons from small arms, to armored vehicles,
*21:25.280- 21:35.200* :  to heavy artillery. So the loss for the Hunta in this important part of the country was significant.
*21:36.320- 21:41.900* :  The government has also been defeated in parts along the Chinese border as well.
*21:42.880- 21:47.020* :  How concerned do you think the neighboring nations are about? What is going on?
*21:48.060- 21:52.200* :  Well, they're very concerned. I mean, last week, the Indian government, for example,
*21:52.200- 21:59.920* :  announced that more than 400 Hunta soldiers crossed into India, running from the fighting.
*21:59.920- 22:07.680* :  I know that at least a few hundred more crossed over in just the last couple of days. In China,
*22:08.560- 22:14.680* :  of course, you know, the border has been very volatile.
*22:15.420- 22:20.620* :  Chinese citizens have been victimized by cymer scam operations and violence on the border,
*22:20.620- 22:26.000* :  because of the lawlessness in me and more. And of course, China has considerable investments
*22:26.000- 22:33.780* :  in the country and is seeking to have a trade flow through some of these key border areas
*22:34.540- 22:41.460* :  that are now under siege. So it's volatile, it's unstable, and it's the reason, for example,
*22:41.460- 22:50.460* :  why Beijing brought some of the leaders together to engage in ceasefire talks and to establish
*22:50.880- 22:56.620* :  an agreement to stabilize their border. But they have fallen apart, and the most recent agreement,
*22:57.420- 23:02.840* :  we now know that the Hunta has been sending artillery shells into opposition areas and
*23:03.320- 23:09.440* :  clashes are beginning again. So it's very volatile and it's very unstable and unsettling
*23:10.020- 23:12.860* :  for me and Mars neighbors. There's just no question about it.
*23:12.980- 23:18.980* :  And what about the ordinary people caught up in this fighting in Myanmar, particularly as the
*23:19.700- 23:24.440* :  the military, the government forces are retreating from these parts as they're defeated?
*23:25.160- 23:31.000* :  Well, that is the biggest single concern that I have. The military of me, the Hunta,
*23:31.820- 23:37.440* :  of me and Mars, what they would, they respond to defeats by attacking the most vulnerable.
*23:37.440- 23:43.420* :  They attack civilian populations. And we've seen significant attacks, aerial bombardments,
*23:43.420- 23:51.620* :  artillery shells, into these civilian areas and my fear is that as these losses mount up,
*23:51.620- 23:57.600* :  that is, the Hunta's losses mount up, that we're going to see even more and more of these civilian
*23:58.700- 24:04.980* :  communities and villages attacked by the Hunta. That is their pattern. And I fear that we're
*24:04.980- 24:09.360* :  going to see even more of that in the days, weeks, and perhaps months to come.
*24:10.100- 24:13.820* :  Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur, on human rights in Myanmar.
*24:14.920- 24:19.860* :  As we record this podcast, judges in Northern Uganda are due to make a decision on whether the
*24:19.860- 24:24.460* :  long awaited trial of a former commander of the rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army,
*24:24.460- 24:30.020* :  should go ahead. Tomas Coyello was captured by the Ugandan Army a decade and a half ago.
*24:30.680- 24:36.140* :  The LRA was notorious for chopping off people's limbs and abducting children to use as soldiers
*24:36.140- 24:40.740* :  and sex slaves. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes by the conflict.
*24:41.380- 24:46.500* :  Sophie Neiman is a journalist in Uganda who's been following the case through its many torturous
*24:46.500- 24:53.080* :  twists and turns. Coyello is a former commander in the Lord's Resistance Army and he's accused
*24:53.740- 25:01.620* :  of murder, rape, and even the recruitment of child soldiers. But Coyello was also a child soldier
*25:02.140- 25:07.600* :  himself. And as a result, his story encapsulates very complex debates about whether
*25:08.260- 25:15.520* :  LRA recruits should be forgiven or forced to face justice. But more importantly, Coyello is also
*25:15.520- 25:22.420* :  the first and only LRA commander to be tried for his crimes in Uganda itself, making his case
*25:22.420- 25:28.680* :  essentially a test for the Ugandan legal system. The case has been taking place for 14 years
*25:29.080- 25:36.360* :  and the past more than a decade of hearings and sessions are essentially just a pre-trial period.
*25:36.660- 25:42.660* :  And there are many reasons why it's been taking so long. The first is the fact that this is
*25:43.380- 25:49.720* :  the first case of its kind in Uganda. And those legal complexities can take a long time to sort
*25:49.720- 25:56.320* :  out anywhere in the world. The court in which Coyello was being tried is Ugandan's answer to the
*25:56.320- 26:04.020* :  ICC. The coronavirus pandemic also shut down Ugandan courts for two years further contributing to
*26:04.020- 26:10.560* :  delays. But as the case strikes on, funding is running out. The key issue now is money.
*26:11.580- 26:16.780* :  And that's difficult not only for the accused who's been awaiting conviction or an acquittal
*26:17.240- 26:22.540* :  for nearly as much time as he's spent in the LRA, but also for his alleged victims. People want
*26:22.540- 26:29.660* :  justice. But at the same time, justice in Northern Uganda means different things to different people.
*26:29.660- 26:35.840* :  So the issue there is not necessarily how much time it's taking, but whether or not Coyello should
*26:35.840- 26:41.020* :  be on trial at all. Of course, there are people who want to see a traditional court process and
*26:41.020- 26:48.940* :  receive reparations. But I've also met with former members of the LRA who said that Coyello should
*26:48.940- 26:56.080* :  be forgiven and welcomed home. And on top of that, because it's taken so much time, there are still
*26:56.080- 27:01.800* :  other people who just want to move on with their lives after decades of war and send their children
*27:01.800- 27:08.100* :  to school or put food on the table. So this complex case has very little impact on their daily lives.
*27:09.300- 27:15.400* :  Sophie Neiman in Uganda. South Africa has always had a reputation for violent crime,
*27:15.400- 27:20.900* :  but now the number of murders and car jackings has sought to its highest level in 20 years.
*27:21.600- 27:26.200* :  People are so scared that those who can afford it are turning to private security firms for
*27:26.200- 27:32.620* :  protection because they don't trust the police. Daniel Dismoon sent this report from Johannesburg.
*27:37.380- 27:42.920* :  I'm in the car with an armed intervention team from a private security company here in Johannesburg
*27:43.240- 27:50.260* :  around midnight. We're just heard that a car has been stolen and the car, like many in South
*27:50.260- 27:56.620* :  Africa, has got a digital tracker in it, which means we're currently chasing this car. And it's
*27:56.620- 28:01.700* :  a bit of a race against time because the teams say that the thieves will be trying to pull the
*28:01.700- 28:07.740* :  tracker out before we can catch up with them. It's a game of cat and mouse. I mean who gets it first?
*28:07.880- 28:12.580* :  And I knew you were onto them. It was literally seconds that we must these guys.
*28:13.820- 28:19.200* :  Armed private security patrols are often the first responders to crime instead of the police
*28:19.200- 28:24.660* :  who many see as absent and untrustworthy. Lizette Lancaster is with South Africa's
*28:24.660- 28:30.280* :  institute for security studies. They are more private security officers in South Africa than
*28:30.280- 28:34.700* :  they are police officers. The vast majority of South Africans cannot afford these
*28:34.700- 28:42.000* :  services but feel equally failed by the police. The brash confidence of violent criminals is
*28:42.000- 28:47.980* :  vividly illustrated by cash in transit hijacks, often known here simply as CIT.
*28:56.140- 29:01.840* :  You're hearing audio from inside security vans carrying money as they're deliberately rammed
*29:01.840- 29:09.320* :  off busy daytime roads by cars with guards set upon by armed men who use bombs to blow open
*29:09.320- 29:20.240* :  safes. Three cars at the back three cars in front. They start shooting. This guard who wanted to
*29:20.240- 29:27.720* :  remain anonymous survived a robbery but some don't. Yes as a human being I'm scared. I'm going out.
*29:27.720- 29:36.200* :  I might not come back by this life for everyone in CIT. His boss Val Bartman head of major security
*29:36.200- 29:43.520* :  firm Fidelity ADT wants more help from government to stop organized crime. Well it's like a terrorist
*29:43.520- 29:49.060* :  group. It's been very military organized well executed and if you see the way that they plan
*29:49.060- 29:55.640* :  these robberies is very difficult for our teams to stop that. Murders are at a two decade high with
*29:55.640- 30:02.780* :  over 27,000 people killed in a year but the number that has solved has fallen to a grave low
*30:02.780- 30:11.060* :  only 12% meaning few killers face justice. Minister in charge of policing Becker Saleh accepts
*30:11.060- 30:17.920* :  there's a major challenge. Our medal rate is not pleasing at all. Our sexual attack is not
*30:17.920- 30:25.180* :  pleasing at all, car hijack and all that. As the police we think we are getting on top of them.
*30:25.180- 30:30.820* :  There are things that have happened maybe that have put us on the little bit of a big foot.
*30:31.280- 30:36.860* :  In this state of insecurity the wave of violence will not be quickly turned back.
*30:37.960- 30:43.740* :  That report by Daniel Dissimone. Pop superstar Madonna is currently touring the world with
*30:43.740- 30:48.700* :  her celebration tour. It was rescheduled from last year after the singer was hospitalised with
*30:48.700- 30:54.580* :  a bacterial infection. But while the 65 year olds tour may be back in the groove it seems
*30:54.580- 30:59.560* :  some of her fans are not so happy with other aspects of Madonna's timekeeping.
*30:59.560- 31:01.320* :  Has Rebecca Wood reports.
*31:13.460- 31:18.940* :  Time goes by so slowly and that's especially true for two Madonna fans who attended the New York
*31:18.940- 31:23.820* :  leg of her tour. According to documents found on Wednesday Michael Fellows and Jonathan
*31:23.820- 31:28.620* :  Hadden have launched legal action against the Queen of Pop accusing her of false advertising
*31:29.220- 31:33.140* :  and inconveniencing concert goers after showing up on stage hours late.
*31:33.920- 31:39.060* :  The pair claimed she didn't appear at Brooklyn's Barkley Centre until 1045 pm on the 13th
*31:39.060- 31:45.100* :  of December last year. That's two hours and 15 minutes after the scheduled 830 start time.
*31:45.800- 31:49.380* :  And it was that delay that meant the show didn't finish until around one in the morning.
*31:49.860- 31:54.420* :  Leaving fans with limited public transport and ride sharing especially difficult they
*31:54.460- 31:58.340* :  point out for those who had to get up for work or take care of family the next day.
*31:59.360- 32:03.040* :  It's not the first time Madonna has faced legal troubles for starting her shows more than
*32:03.040- 32:08.680* :  fashionably late. In 2019 a Florida fan argued that her lateness on her Madam X tour was a breach
*32:08.680- 32:14.220* :  of contract and again in 2020 there was a lawsuit filed by two New York concert goers.
*32:15.140- 32:19.280* :  The singer hasn't commented on the most recent allegations but perhaps she holds a similar
*32:19.280- 32:23.920* :  sentiment to this one that she shared with her Las Vegas fans after complaints over her lack of
*32:23.920- 32:43.100* :  punctuality a few years ago. The Queen of Pop Madonna ending that report by Rebecca Wood.
*32:46.380- 32:51.280* :  And that's all from this edition of the Global News Podcast but before we go here's
