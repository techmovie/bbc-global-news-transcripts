*00:51.520- 00:57.240* :  imminent abdication of Denmark's Queen Mugrater and the country's new king mean for all of

*01:14.160- 01:17.800* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:19.720- 01:25.560* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Saturday, the 13th of January, these are our
*01:25.560- 01:26.300* :  main stories.
*01:26.860- 01:31.940* :  The Pentagon says the hoothies have reacted to US and UK air strikes in Yemen by firing
*01:31.940- 01:36.020* :  a missile at another ship, reportedly a tanker carrying Russian oil.
*01:36.480- 01:38.800* :  Joe Biden says action had to be taken.
*01:39.160- 01:43.320* :  I don't think it is civilly casual, so that's another reason why it's a success.
*01:43.780- 01:49.060* :  The air strikes have prompted huge rallies in Yemen's capital and condemnation from
*01:49.060- 01:50.740* :  Russia, Turkey and Iran.
*01:51.240- 01:57.100* :  And a UN aid official says the conditions on the ground in Gaza are beyond anyone's worst
*01:57.100- 01:57.560* :  nightmare.
*02:00.640- 02:06.180* :  Also in this podcast, Cape Verde becomes the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa in
*02:06.180- 02:13.440* :  50 years to eradicate malaria and a bear with what maybe post-traumatic stress disorder gets
*02:13.440- 02:15.220* :  a new home in Scotland.
*02:15.700- 02:20.420* :  He's been through a lot, he's been in the middle of a war zone and we would expect him
*02:20.460- 02:21.440* :  to be quite nervous.
*02:21.440- 02:25.380* :  We have to obviously approach precaution and make sure that we're catering to Yamples
*02:30.220- 02:30.300* :  needs as an individual.
*02:30.320- 02:35.360* :  Hoothie fighters have responded to last night's air strikes by American and British forces
*02:35.360- 02:40.000* :  by firing another missile at a ship off the coast of Yemen according to the Pentagon.
*02:40.540- 02:45.640* :  But that vessel, it seems, was carrying Russian oil and Russia had condemned the US-led
*02:45.640- 02:50.640* :  air strikes as illegitimate, meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the Yemeni
*02:50.640- 02:54.540* :  capital, Sanaa, chanting death to America, death to Israel.
*03:00.120- 03:05.300* :  It was the attacks by Hoothie's on international shipping, which had led to the American and
*03:05.300- 03:07.020* :  British air strikes in the first place.
*03:07.460- 03:11.560* :  In Washington, President Biden said that he considered the Hoothie's a terrorist group
*03:11.980- 03:14.980* :  and he called the military action against them a success.
*03:20.300- 03:24.520* :  The Department of Defense, spokesman Major General Patrick Ryder said the military
*03:24.520- 03:26.440* :  action had very clear aims.
*03:26.900- 03:33.640* :  We targeted specific facilities and capabilities intended to degrade and disrupt the Hoothie's
*03:33.660- 03:37.460* :  ability to contact the kinds of attacks that we've been seeing, and we'll be prepared
*03:37.460- 03:39.240* :  to take further action should we need to.
*03:39.440- 03:43.000* :  Our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel has our first report.
*03:45.160- 03:48.360* :  This was a US-led and coordinated operation.
*03:49.140- 03:54.020* :  At night, dozens of gens taking off from one of its aircraft carriers already in the red
*03:56.920- 03:56.940* :  scene.
*03:56.980- 03:58.660* :  The scene of recent tensions.
*03:59.680- 04:04.880* :  The impact soon felt right across the large chunk of Yemen, the Hoothie rebels controlled.
*04:08.140- 04:14.560* :  The US said more than 60 strikes on military facilities, specifically Ryder, drones and
*04:14.560- 04:20.380* :  missile sites, the Hoothies have been using in recent months to target merchant shipping
*04:20.820- 04:21.660* :  in the Red Sea.
*04:22.160- 04:28.040* :  Promoted, they say, by Israel's war in Gaza, the Hoothies had already been warned to stop
*04:28.040- 04:29.800* :  or face the consequences.
*04:30.380- 04:34.520* :  Britain was the only other country to directly participate in the strikes.
*04:35.220- 04:40.520* :  Both Britain and the US have said they hope this action will reduce tensions in the region.
*04:41.280- 04:47.480* :  The danger now is of more tit-for-tat attacks, but that's still more containable than a
*04:47.480- 04:49.000* :  wider Middle East conflict.
*04:49.140- 04:55.580* :  The West's hope that the Hoothie's main backer Iran will still not get directly involved.
*04:55.940- 05:01.200* :  Downing Street said there were currently no plans to repeat last night's air strikes.
*05:01.920- 05:07.300* :  But President Biden says he won't hesitate, if necessary, to do the same again.
*05:07.880- 05:08.620* :  Jonathan Beall.
*05:09.280- 05:11.700* :  Worldwide reaction to the strikes has been divided.
*05:11.700- 05:16.860* :  Many allies of the US have expressed their support, but other countries reacted with
*05:16.860- 05:17.280* :  fury.
*05:17.580- 05:22.880* :  Russia and Iran condemned the action, while Turkey accused Britain and America of turning
*05:22.880- 05:24.840* :  the Red Sea into a sea of blood.
*05:25.460- 05:28.340* :  This our world affairs correspondent Caroline Hawley.
*05:28.700- 05:33.160* :  For the past three months, tireless international diplomacy has been devoted to trying to contain
*05:33.160- 05:36.920* :  the crisis that followed the Hamas assault into Israel on October 7.
*05:37.860- 05:43.180* :  This significant spillover has caused deep concern around the Middle East, a region already
*05:43.180- 05:44.320* :  very much on edge.
*05:44.880- 05:49.140* :  Many Arab countries have joined Russia and of course Iran in criticizing the air strikes.
*05:50.060- 05:52.740* :  Bahrain alone in the region in supporting them.
*05:53.500- 05:58.100* :  Oman, a Western ally that's mediated with Iran in the past, said it condemned the bombing,
*05:58.100- 06:03.960* :  while Israel was continuing what it called its brutal war and siege of Gaza without accountability.
*06:05.080- 06:09.380* :  President Erdogan of Turkey described the strikes as a disproportionate use of force
*06:09.380- 06:11.260* :  by America, backed by Britain.
*06:13.380- 06:16.240* :  At the moment they're trying to turn the Red Sea into a sea of blood.
*06:16.940- 06:21.200* :  And Yemen, with the Hoothies and by using all of its force, says it is giving and will
*06:21.200- 06:24.920* :  give the necessary response in the region to America and Britain.
*06:25.140- 06:29.280* :  The countries that have supported the strikes say there was no alternative
*06:29.760- 06:33.000* :  with the Hoothies holding international shipping and trade to ransom.
*06:33.880- 06:39.160* :  The Defence Minister of Australia Richard Miles said it had personnel in the operational headquarters.
*06:39.880- 06:43.960* :  The actions that have been taken today, supported by Australia,
*06:44.520- 06:48.380* :  are about maintaining freedom of navigation on the high seas.
*06:48.660- 06:51.080* :  They are about maintaining global trade.
*06:51.080- 06:55.580* :  That is completely central to Australia's national interest.
*06:56.060- 06:59.340* :  American officials say there's no reason for this to escalate any further.
*06:59.740- 07:05.740* :  Caroline Hawley, Israel has called on the International Court of Justice to reject the case
*07:05.740- 07:09.960* :  brought by South Africa, which alleges that it is committing genocide in Gaza.
*07:10.460- 07:14.000* :  On the second and final day of hearings at the UN's highest court,
*07:14.440- 07:17.720* :  Israel's lawyers said that South Africa had presented a sweeping
*07:17.720- 07:20.380* :  counterfactual description of the conflict.
*07:20.840- 07:25.740* :  This was the knob of the Israeli argument as spelled out by the country's deputy attorney general,
*07:26.000- 07:26.840* :  Gilad Noam.
*07:27.340- 07:30.300* :  Yes, there is a heart-wrenching armed conflict,
*07:31.060- 07:35.080* :  but the attempt to classify it as genocide and trigger provisional measures
*07:36.040- 07:37.940* :  is not just unfounded in law.
*07:38.740- 07:43.940* :  It has far-reaching and negative implications that extend well beyond the case
*07:43.940- 07:48.140* :  before you. Ultimately, entertaining the applicant's request
*07:48.700- 07:53.060* :  will not strengthen the commitment to prevent and punish genocide, but weaken it.
*07:54.020- 07:57.740* :  It will turn an instrument adopted by the international community
*07:58.380- 08:03.460* :  to prevent horrors of the kind that shocked the conscious of humanity during the Holocaust,
*08:04.520- 08:10.960* :  into a weapon in the hands of terrorist groups who have no regard for humanity or for the law.
*08:11.600- 08:16.680* :  Outside the courts, South Africa's Justice Minister Ronald Lemurah was still sounding bullish.
*08:17.360- 08:23.580* :  We stand by the facts, the law, and then all the evidence we have submitted yesterday,
*08:24.080- 08:28.980* :  and we believe and stand very confident that those facts, the law,
*08:28.980- 08:32.600* :  still are in violation of the genocide convention.
*08:33.020- 08:36.280* :  So what happens next and when can we expect a verdict?
*08:36.280- 08:40.440* :  Anna Holigen has been following proceedings from the ICJ in the Hague,
*08:40.940- 08:41.800* :  and gave me an update.
*08:42.660- 08:45.100* :  These hearings are focused on interim measures.
*08:45.580- 08:50.960* :  South Africa has asked for an urgent injunction to prevent any further harm.
*08:51.180- 08:53.000* :  So South Africa had three hours.
*08:53.140- 08:54.540* :  Israel had three hours.
*08:54.540- 08:58.480* :  Now the judges will probably issue a decision within a matter of weeks.
*08:59.100- 09:07.220* :  And that decision will not affect the more fundamental case decision on South Africa's
*09:07.220- 09:11.360* :  claim that Israel is committing genocide will probably take many more years.
*09:12.000- 09:13.660* :  This is a legal battlefield.
*09:13.660- 09:18.540* :  I haven't ever seen a case at the ICJ which has generated so much
*09:18.540- 09:21.340* :  media and public attention too often.
*09:21.340- 09:27.160* :  These cases happen retrospectively, sometimes decades after the conflicts themselves.
*09:27.900- 09:29.100* :  This one isn't.
*09:29.140- 09:34.220* :  There is a sense that what happens here in the Hague could have a real impact on the ground.
*09:34.700- 09:38.000* :  Anna, when you were speaking to this program yesterday,
*09:38.000- 09:43.580* :  you were making the point that the ICJ is now being used by outside actors to make a case.
*09:43.580- 09:46.660* :  I think you mentioned Myanmar, China and Ukraine.
*09:47.280- 09:52.280* :  Feud from the perspective of the ICJ, is that a good thing or is that a dangerous thing?
*09:52.440- 09:57.160* :  I think when I was in the Peace Palace earlier and just seeing the two sides side by side
*09:57.160- 10:01.980* :  and having these legal arguments, if this can be used as a way to minimize
*10:02.720- 10:08.260* :  harm on the actual battlefield, then I think many people would say that's a good thing.
*10:08.260- 10:15.740* :  There is a danger that courts can be politicized and they have to avoid that by focusing purely on
*10:15.740- 10:18.420* :  the law and the evidence presented.
*10:18.420- 10:23.580* :  Legal experts, lawyers, the public, they'll be going through the judgment with a fine
*10:23.580- 10:30.840* :  twist come to find any evidence of bias and the judges will be very aware of that and they will
*10:30.840- 10:36.080* :  be doing everything possible to avoid any feeling that they are not basing any judgment on anything
*10:36.080- 10:42.600* :  other than the law. Anaholegan in the Hague, diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams was also
*10:42.600- 10:46.080* :  watching today's testimony by Israel and has this analysis.
*10:46.740- 10:49.800* :  Israel could have chosen to ignore the proceedings at the Hague.
*10:49.800- 10:52.600* :  Instead, it mounted a robust vigorous defence,
*10:52.600- 10:55.980* :  summed up perhaps by the words of Professor Malcolm Shaw,
*10:55.980- 10:59.580* :  the British barrister in charge of presenting Israel's case.
*10:59.780- 11:04.800* :  There is no genocidal intent here. This is no genocide.
*11:05.180- 11:06.980* :  The question of intent is key.
*11:06.980- 11:10.100* :  Israeli leaders, including the President and Prime Minister,
*11:10.460- 11:13.740* :  have made frequent incendiary comments over the past three months,
*11:14.140- 11:18.640* :  leading some to conclude that Israel is hell-bent on destroying, not just Hamas,
*11:19.120- 11:21.060* :  but the Palestinian people as a whole.
*11:21.560- 11:25.260* :  But the most apparently genocidal remarks have not been made by those
*11:25.260- 11:27.800* :  actually running Israel's military campaign.
*11:27.800- 11:30.940* :  They might reflect an ugly prevailing climate in Israel,
*11:30.940- 11:33.260* :  but they don't actually represent policy.
*11:33.880- 11:37.220* :  And when it comes to the way Israel has conducted its military operations,
*11:37.220- 11:39.620* :  its lawyers kept asking a question,
*11:40.060- 11:45.480* :  why would an army intent on committing genocide go to such lengths to tell Palestinians to get
*11:45.480- 11:49.120* :  out of harm's way? For the people of Gaza, that sounds hollow.
*11:49.540- 11:52.800* :  Many did follow Israel's instructions to move away from danger,
*11:53.260- 11:55.480* :  only to find themselves being bombed anyway.
*11:55.480- 11:59.700* :  Israel seems confident that the charge of genocide will not be upheld.
*12:00.040- 12:01.780* :  It'll be years before we find out.
*12:02.240- 12:03.760* :  But it's worth remembering one thing.
*12:03.760- 12:07.760* :  This case is not about war crimes, or even ethnic cleansing.
*12:07.760- 12:12.820* :  It's about the ultimate crime of a state trying to destroy an entire people.
*12:12.820- 12:16.980* :  And that, Israel says, is not what it's doing in Gaza.
*12:17.440- 12:18.360* :  Paul Adams.
*12:19.540- 12:22.360* :  Are you an official who has just returned from Gaza?
*12:22.360- 12:25.220* :  Described it as beyond anyone's worst nightmare?
*12:25.220- 12:28.380* :  Dominic Allen said the situation is only getting worse,
*12:28.860- 12:31.820* :  and the world needs to help to get aid in at scale now.
*12:32.280- 12:34.200* :  The BBC's Netatorfic has more.
*12:34.960- 12:39.620* :  After a week in Gaza, Mr. Allen said it was incomparable to anything he or other
*12:39.620- 12:41.700* :  humanitarians had ever seen before.
*12:41.700- 12:45.620* :  He described seeing fear, despair, and desperation everywhere,
*12:46.060- 12:47.940* :  and no basics for sustaining life.
*12:47.940- 12:52.720* :  He said 5,500 pregnant women were due to have a child this month.
*12:52.740- 12:58.060* :  If the bombs don't kill them, if disease hunger and dehydration don't catch up with them,
*12:58.060- 13:00.160* :  he said simply giving birth would.
*13:00.160- 13:02.860* :  He visited partially functioning hospitals.
*13:02.860- 13:08.260* :  At one, the Emirati Hospital, women in their final stages of labor were having to rotate
*13:08.260- 13:11.020* :  in and out, because there wasn't enough room.
*13:11.060- 13:14.720* :  After birth, they're given a matter of hours to be discharged.
*13:14.900- 13:18.980* :  There are 180 babies being born every day in Gaza,
*13:19.320- 13:24.300* :  and doctors have reported seeing higher rates of malnutrition and below average weights.
*13:24.740- 13:29.860* :  Netatorfic, meanwhile, Israel says it has reached an agreement with Qatar that will allow the
*13:29.860- 13:34.220* :  delivery of medication to hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.
*13:34.680- 13:37.260* :  The suppliers are expected to be sent over the coming days.
*13:37.660- 13:41.500* :  Our Middle East correspondent, Wira Davis, gave me an update from Jerusalem.
*13:41.900- 13:47.240* :  The families of the 130 or so hostages that are being kept in Gaza by Hamas
*13:47.680- 13:52.200* :  and other armed Palestinian groups have been putting an awful lot of pressure on the Israeli
*13:52.200- 13:57.160* :  government to do more to secure their release, and it was to make sure that medical aid
*13:57.160- 14:00.660* :  gets through to them, because there's been an absence of that for the last 100 days.
*14:01.260- 14:05.960* :  And of course, after the recent assassinations in Lebanon of a leading Hamas figure
*14:06.420- 14:09.700* :  and leading Hezbollah figure is presumed by Israel,
*14:10.200- 14:15.240* :  negotiations between the Israelis and the Qataris over the fate of the hostages appear to have
*14:15.240- 14:19.900* :  been broken down. But in the last couple of days, that link that path was restarted again.
*14:19.900- 14:24.060* :  The head of the Mossad was believed to have gone to Qatar, and the Qataris, of course,
*14:24.060- 14:29.260* :  speak to Hamas. And now a deal has been put together, which will ensure that the medical aid
*14:29.260- 14:34.400* :  sub-badly needed by many of the hostages, including diabetes medication, blood pressure medication,
*14:34.540- 14:39.760* :  should get through to those hostages who have been held in Communicado somewhere in Gaza,
*14:39.760- 14:44.900* :  presumably many of them underground. The quid pro quo is that much of the medication that's
*14:44.900- 14:48.980* :  needed by the population of Gaza itself, many of whom have been displaced from their homes,
*14:49.500- 14:53.680* :  that will also increase. Of course, humanitarian aid is badly needed in Gaza,
*14:54.200- 14:58.960* :  medical aid in particular is badly needed. So the Israelis will allow more medical aid to get
*14:58.960- 15:05.160* :  to the Palestinians, and Hamas will allow specific medical aid required by some of the hostages.
*15:05.580- 15:09.960* :  It's not quite as much of the hostage families want, but it is a sign of progress.
*15:10.460- 15:17.160* :  We're, Davis. Cape Verde has become the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa in 50 years
*15:17.160- 15:23.160* :  to eradicate malaria, and just the fourth on the continent ever. The status was confirmed by the
*15:23.160- 15:27.880* :  World Health Organization after three years without a single case being reported,
*15:27.880- 15:31.700* :  our Africa Health Correspondent, Dorkas-Wangira sent this report.
*15:32.020- 15:37.500* :  Cape Verde may be a small island nation, but its achievement is huge. Countries that have
*15:37.500- 15:42.780* :  achieved at least three consecutive years of zero local cases are eligible to apply for
*15:42.780- 15:48.480* :  WHO certification of malaria-free status. Dr. Dorothy Attu, team leader at WHO,
*15:48.480- 15:53.040* :  regional office for Africa, told the BBC that it's taken a lot of effort.
*15:53.060- 15:59.640* :  We are really pleased that there are some concrete resources coming out from the efforts that
*16:00.220- 16:06.180* :  not working just like doctors, medical doctors, but also vitro control teams, educational
*16:06.420- 16:14.480* :  communication experts in the region have been doing to ensure that malaria is kicked off out of
*16:14.480- 16:18.940* :  Africa. A survivor of the deadly disease in the island remembers what it was like.
*16:19.320- 16:26.100* :  I suffered from malaria and I was hospitalized for 15 years at the prayer hospital.
*16:26.540- 16:35.940* :  If Cape Verde is officially free of malaria, I can only congratulate the government and all the
*16:35.940- 16:40.860* :  medical team who worked for this result.
*16:41.500- 16:46.420* :  The country's strengthened health system ensures increased access to proper diagnosis of all
*16:46.420- 16:52.260* :  cases and treatment, free care and agnostic services for international travelers and migrants
*16:52.260- 16:56.920* :  is a priority. Dr. Philomena González is Cape Verde's health minister.
*16:59.500- 17:04.520* :  It is a testimony to what can be achieved through collective commitment to improving public health.
*17:04.660- 17:08.980* :  Without a doubt, their education of malaria is a strong attraction for tourism.
*17:09.220- 17:14.160* :  This achievement not only improves public health, but also reinforces Cape Verde's image
*17:14.160- 17:16.120* :  as a safe and healthy destination.
*17:16.900- 17:17.840* :  Dorkas Wangera
*17:20.760- 17:23.420* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*17:23.420- 17:29.760* :  I'm very, very excited. We have known about the Upano Valley findings that we have never seen
*17:29.760- 17:34.860* :  them displayed in the way that they're being shown now by airborne technology.
*17:35.340- 17:39.580* :  We hear more about the discovery of a huge ancient city in the Amazon.
*17:47.800- 17:52.300* :  The Ukrainian President for Lodemyr Zelensky is heavily reliant on the West
*17:52.300- 17:56.640* :  for financial and military support in its ongoing war with Russia.
*17:57.040- 18:02.020* :  But Republicans in the US Congress are blocking President Biden from sending an estimated
*18:02.580- 18:06.620* :  60 billion dollars in emergency aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile,
*18:06.620- 18:11.120* :  Hungary's President, Viktor Orban, is vetoing funding from the European Union.
*18:11.120- 18:14.440* :  However, on Friday, there was some good news for Ukraine.
*18:14.440- 18:20.180* :  As the British Prime Minister, Rishisunak, signed a new security pact with President Zelensky
*18:20.180- 18:25.940* :  in the Capitol Keefe. Mr. Sunak promised his country's unwavering support for Ukraine.
*18:26.880- 18:29.920* :  We will provide the modern equipment across land, sea and sky,
*18:29.920- 18:34.460* :  sanctioned Russia's economy and work closely with allies to do so.
*18:35.140- 18:38.760* :  You will not have to ask. You will not have to argue for what you need.
*18:39.680- 18:43.080* :  The UK will be there from the first moment to the last.
*18:43.680- 18:47.320* :  Mr. Zelensky called the Security Agreement, which covers intelligent,
*18:47.320- 18:53.360* :  sharing, cyber security and arms manufacturing, a watershed moment in European history.
*18:53.840- 18:59.420* :  Our correspondent, Tim Keefe, Abdul-Juleal, Abdul-Rassalov told me about the significance of the
*18:59.420- 19:04.360* :  agreement. Well, essentially, this, this, and the announcement about the security deal,
*19:05.040- 19:09.860* :  they are all aimed at one thing to send a message to the Ukrainian government,
*19:09.860- 19:15.620* :  to the people of Ukraine and also to Moscow as well, that Ukraine is not alone and will not be
*19:15.620- 19:20.960* :  alone as Prime Minister Rishisunak said during his press conference. Mr. Sunak announced a new
*19:20.960- 19:28.420* :  military aid package worth $3.2 billion, and that package will include a long-range
*19:28.500- 19:35.340* :  missiles, air defense and artillery ammunition, anti-tank weapons, and also drones. He says that
*19:35.340- 19:42.020* :  about 200 million pounds will be spent to deliver drones to Ukraine. And of course,
*19:42.020- 19:47.020* :  this announcement comes at a critical time when other allies, the US and the EU,
*19:47.340- 19:50.360* :  are still struggling to release their own military and financial packages.
*19:50.920- 19:56.580* :  And this deal is sending a key message that Ukraine will still receive its aid and support
*19:56.580- 20:02.820* :  from its partners. And also the new security deal that was signed today by the UK and Ukraine,
*20:03.560- 20:10.380* :  it includes the provision to continue military support in a long-term basis. However,
*20:10.940- 20:17.340* :  these are not security guarantees, not as some people assume, these are provisions to continue
*20:17.340- 20:24.320* :  military support in a sense that providing weapons, training personnel, and also sharing
*20:24.320- 20:29.720* :  intelligence. But it doesn't include the guarantees in the sense that the UK and other countries
*20:29.720- 20:35.140* :  that will sign similar deals will not send their troops to Ukraine and fight on behalf of Ukraine.
*20:36.160- 20:42.980* :  Abdul Jalil, Abdul Russellov. The head of the UN Human Rights Agency has criticised a crackdown
*20:42.980- 20:48.780* :  on drugs in Sri Lanka, which is resulted in the arrest of nearly 30,000 people in just under a
*20:48.780- 20:54.480* :  month with more details. Here's Rachel Wright. Every day for the past month Sri Lankan television
*20:54.540- 20:59.200* :  has been flooded with dramatic pictures of drug seizures, mass arrests, and sniffer dogs.
*20:59.660- 21:04.380* :  On December the 17th, the Acting Chief of Police and the Minister of Public Security
*21:04.380- 21:10.540* :  announced Operation Yuktia a crackdown on illegal drugs because they claimed Sri Lanka had become
*21:10.540- 21:16.380* :  a drug trafficking transit point. They said they aimed to rid the country of illegal drugs by June
*21:16.380- 21:22.740* :  this year. But more than 30 international human rights organisations, including Amnesty International,
*21:22.740- 21:28.900* :  have expressed deep concern over the actions of the police. And today the head of the UN Human Rights
*21:28.900- 21:34.720* :  Agency Volkha Turk echoed those sentiments and called on the government to review the operation.
*21:34.720- 21:40.840* :  In a statement, Mr Turk said security forces have reportedly subjected people to a number of
*21:40.840- 21:46.940* :  violations, including unauthorized searches, arbitrary arrests and detention, ill treatment, torture,
*21:46.940- 21:52.200* :  and strip searches in public. He also said that lawyers acting for those who have been detained
*21:52.200- 21:57.960* :  are being intimidated by police officers. Local human rights activists said the arrests were not
*21:57.960- 22:04.400* :  based on evidence but targeted drug users and small-time dealers in poor areas. But the acting
*22:04.400- 22:08.820* :  head of police, Deshabandu, Tenakun, said the operation is effective.
*22:12.140- 22:15.780* :  Most of you are under the impression that the police are arresting the small-scale dealers
*22:15.780- 22:21.040* :  instead of the large-scale drug traffickers. That is true. When we arrest the small-scale dealers,
*22:21.040- 22:25.880* :  we will get a hold of those behind the mega dealings. If you take a look at the statistics during
*22:25.880- 22:29.880* :  the last week and the week before, the crime rate in this country has dropped significantly.
*22:30.880- 22:34.980* :  Then we eliminate drug trafficking in the next six months. The crime rate of this country
*22:34.980- 22:39.700* :  will go down by 50 percent. With almost a thousand people a day being arrested in this
*22:39.700- 22:44.700* :  crackdown, the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission says the operation will only exacerbate the
*22:44.700- 22:51.880* :  problem of prison overcrowding. Rachel Wright with that report. Taiwan holds its elections on Saturday
*22:51.880- 22:57.480* :  amid escalating tension with China. Beijing sees the self-governed island as a breakaway
*22:57.480- 23:02.580* :  province that will eventually be part of the country and has not ruled out the use of force
*23:02.580- 23:07.640* :  to achieve this. The contest is between the two major parties that have dominated Taiwanese
*23:07.640- 23:13.880* :  politics for decades, the Democratic Progressive Party currently in power, and the opposition party
*23:13.880- 23:21.660* :  Kuomintang. Home to just 70,000 residents, Kinmen is nestled right beside mainland China.
*23:21.660- 23:26.680* :  It has its own history and sense of identity, and not everyone supports the current
*23:26.680- 23:33.100* :  president's rocky relationship with Beijing, as the BBC's Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton has
*23:33.100- 23:40.960* :  been finding out. We've just arrived in the airport on Kinmen Island, the only airport I should
*23:40.960- 23:48.500* :  say on this tiny island. It's geographically close to mainland China. In fact, it's so close you
*23:48.500- 23:55.340* :  can see mainland China from Kinmen. A short drive away from the airport, we go to a place that
*23:55.340- 23:59.440* :  highlights the close connections between Kinmen and mainland China.
*24:02.820- 24:09.080* :  We've come to the ferry terminal. It only takes half an hour to take the ferry from here
*24:09.140- 24:16.600* :  to mainland China. Mr Tsai from the terminal's ticket office says the ferry is much less busy now
*24:16.600- 24:24.560* :  than before the pandemic. At the moment, the ferry provides eight round trips per day and
*24:24.560- 24:29.420* :  carries about 60 to 70 percent of the total passenger capacity. Because of the election,
*24:29.900- 24:34.040* :  more people are coming into Kinmen in recent days than going out, because they need to come back
*24:34.040- 24:38.520* :  to vote. The trip is about nine nautical miles and passengers are mainly Taiwanese businessmen.
*24:39.040- 24:43.860* :  People who visit relatives and small traders, we're a special service. No matter how tense
*24:43.860- 24:49.300* :  the cross-strait relationship is, this route will always be open. That's her basic consensus with
*24:49.300- 24:58.300* :  the mainland. The dock workers are getting ready for the ferry to arrive. Almost everyone coming
*24:58.300- 25:07.920* :  off the ferry is carrying huge cardboard boxes and shopping bags. I went to the mainland to do
*25:07.920- 25:14.800* :  shopping about every half a month or once a month. I can be quite frequently for my business,
*25:14.800- 25:22.640* :  selling small accessories, wholesale. There's a petition here to build a bridge between Kinmen
*25:22.640- 25:28.980* :  and mainland China. One of the passengers coming off the ferry happened to be a local woman who's
*25:28.980- 25:34.540* :  part of a group promoting peace between Beijing and Taiwan. We asked her what she thought of the
*25:34.540- 25:42.540* :  bridge idea. If we enter discussion for years but has phased many obstacles, personally,
*25:42.580- 25:47.960* :  I hope the bridge could be built at the end. I think it's good for the cross-strait transportation
*25:48.740- 25:53.060* :  and also be good for the friendly exchanges between people on both sides.
*25:53.540- 26:01.080* :  There's also an idea for Kinmen to become kind of a demilitarized zone between Taiwan and China,
*26:01.760- 26:05.260* :  but with tensions so high, few think that's a possibility now.
*26:08.620- 26:13.580* :  The Everett shopping mall was built for Chinese tourists. He's got a Starbucks,
*26:13.580- 26:20.140* :  some McDonald's and lots of luxury stores. There are a few people walking around in here,
*26:20.440- 26:25.620* :  but they're people from Kinmen Island because the tourist trade from China has been stopped.
*26:26.640- 26:32.840* :  And that's really the case in point. People who live on Taiwan's main island can really get by
*26:32.840- 26:38.640* :  existing in a bubble if they want to. They can avoid thinking about the possible threat posed
*26:38.680- 26:45.440* :  by China, but that's just not possible in Kinmen because this place is interconnected with the
*26:45.440- 26:51.280* :  mainland. There's a real awareness here that peace with China should be preserved.
*26:54.860- 27:01.700* :  We've come to our last stop on Kinmen at the workshop of Master Wu, a highly skilled blacksmith.
*27:02.740- 27:07.820* :  He makes knives from all pieces of artillery, shelves that were fired on Kinmen from
*27:07.820- 27:16.040* :  neighboring China, right up until 1979. It represents war and peace, like turning hostility into
*27:16.040- 27:21.540* :  friendship, or beating swords into plowshears. It's a symbol of peace. There's a saying on the
*27:21.540- 27:27.280* :  island, war is ruthless. Peace is priceless. We ask Master Wu about it.
*27:27.660- 27:29.460* :  Dan Zhan Wu Qing He Ping Wu Jia.
*27:29.900- 27:35.840* :  Kinmen has been through war for most of our Kinmenes to maintain peace as a universal goal.
*27:36.260- 27:40.940* :  It's the most important thing. People from both sides of the strait are all Chinese.
*27:41.900- 27:45.980* :  If we can stay friendly and peaceful with the mainland, it'll be best for Kinmen,
*27:46.520- 27:48.800* :  and the safest. There's no need for confrontation.
*27:51.000- 27:54.920* :  Our Asia Pacific Editor Celia Hassan reporting from Kinmen Island.
*27:56.220- 28:01.300* :  We told you briefly in our earlier edition of this podcast about the discovery of a huge
*28:01.300- 28:06.700* :  city in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. For thousands of years, it was hidden under a vast
*28:06.700- 28:13.460* :  canopy of green in the Upano area of eastern Ecuador. The researchers found that the houses and
*28:13.460- 28:19.080* :  plasas were connected by an astounding network of roads and canals. Experts say it's hugely
*28:19.080- 28:25.660* :  significant and suggest some ancient civilizations in the Amazon rainforest were more sophisticated.
*28:25.660- 28:31.240* :  The city lay in the shadow of a volcano which could have ultimately led to its destruction.
*28:31.240- 28:38.900* :  Manuel Arroyo Kalin from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London is an expert on
*28:38.900- 28:43.900* :  the region of South America where the discovery was made. He spoke to Anita Anand.
*28:44.640- 28:50.740* :  I'm very, very excited. We have known about the Upano Valley findings for some time,
*28:50.820- 28:56.480* :  but we have never seen them displayed in the way that they're being shown now by the application
*28:56.560- 29:02.080* :  of new airborne technology and the scale at which they're shown today and the arguments that
*29:02.080- 29:07.500* :  have been put together in the recent paper that is published in Science begins to tie a number
*29:07.500- 29:14.800* :  of aspects that allow us to look at contemporary naity, connectivity, landscape, modification and
*29:14.800- 29:19.280* :  intensification. It's fascinating. It's hard, isn't it? When you've got a rainforest, you've got
*29:19.280- 29:23.420* :  such thick growth over the top. How have they seen these roads in these pathways?
*29:23.420- 29:28.920* :  Yes, so it's the application of technology known as lighter. That's a laser detection and
*29:28.920- 29:35.240* :  ranging. It works by laser pulses from an airborne vehicle. The laser pulses are pulsed at
*29:35.300- 29:40.500* :  millimetric distances and they reach, if you fly on top of a forest, they reach either the leaves
*29:40.500- 29:46.860* :  or the floor. Then through data processing, we clean off those pulses that never reached the floor
*29:46.860- 29:52.900* :  and we're left with a contour-shaped image of the ground under the rain for a canopy. That is
*29:52.900- 29:59.440* :  millimetric in precision and can allow you to see ditches, mound. What is so exciting about this,
*29:59.440- 30:04.300* :  is we're talking about permanent structures, permanent civilizations, if you like, in a place where
*30:04.660- 30:09.620* :  it has always been assumed that people have been somewhat nomadic, moving with the seasons.
*30:10.400- 30:14.960* :  How does it sort of match the time of this ancient civilization with what else was going on around
*30:14.960- 30:22.000* :  the world? If you compare to what is happening in the Amazon basin, 2,500 years BP, so that's
*30:22.000- 30:28.460* :  about a 500 BC, is a significant time because at that time we are only beginning to see the
*30:28.460- 30:33.880* :  inklings of other landscape modifications of a similar size or similar scale in other parts,
*30:33.880- 30:39.000* :  but not necessarily in Amazonia itself. There are some earlier developments in other parts of South
*30:39.000- 30:44.380* :  America, notably in the Peruvian semi-arid coast and then also in Ecuador. So, and indeed,
*30:44.380- 30:49.940* :  if you compare it to some of the findings in Europe and Asia and Africa, timings are different,
*30:49.940- 30:55.000* :  it's a big world. Yeah, it is a big world. I mean, just very briefly, is it too soon to suppose
*30:55.000- 31:00.200* :  what these people might have been like, looked like, lived like? In short, yes. I mean,
*31:00.200- 31:05.260* :  archaeologists working in the America start with the impact of European colonization as a process.
*31:05.260- 31:10.700* :  We know the people that live there at the time that Europeans arrive, then we know the descendants
*31:10.700- 31:16.580* :  of those people, those records, but as soon as you push back 1500 years from that timeline,
*31:17.380- 31:21.220* :  the people that are there are most likely, the four bearers of some of the indigenous people,
*31:21.220- 31:27.340* :  in the Amazon today, but we don't know precisely whom, so we will refer to them as different cultural
*31:27.340- 31:32.840* :  groups as described by archaeology. Yet, at this site, some of the groups that occupy the location
*31:32.840- 31:38.100* :  around 900 AD are connected to some of the indigenous groups of Ecuador today, and they might,
*31:38.100- 31:42.280* :  in themselves, claim that they're great, great grandparents, built these sites.
*31:42.660- 31:49.440* :  And, well, Aroyo Kalein from the Institute of Archaeology at UCL, speaking to Anita Anand.
*31:50.800- 31:56.980* :  A bear rescued from a war zone by Ukrainian soldiers has been re-homed at a zoo near Edinburgh
*31:56.980- 32:02.920* :  in Scotland. He was found injured and traumatised in an abandoned zoo in Donetsk in the east of
*32:02.920- 32:09.220* :  the country after months of Russian occupation. Our Scotland correspondent, Jamie McIver, reports.
*32:26.740- 32:31.460* :  Moved to an animal sanctuary in Belgium, where he was looked after for several months.
*32:32.320- 32:37.780* :  Now, the 30-stone bear has a home at five-sister's zoo near West Condor in West Lothian.
*32:38.420- 32:43.320* :  This morning, he was introduced to his enclosure after a long overnight journey from Dover.
*32:43.840- 32:48.820* :  Adam Welsh is from the zoo. He's been through a lot, he's been in the middle of a war zone,
*32:48.860- 32:55.640* :  and we would expect him to be quite nervous, potentially show some signs similar to those from
*32:55.640- 33:00.120* :  people that are suffering from PTSD. We're still going to approach with caution. We need to make
*33:00.120- 33:04.720* :  sure that he has some time to settle in here, and we have to, obviously, you know, approach with
*33:04.720- 33:08.980* :  caution and make sure that we're catering to YAMPLES needs as an individual. The zoo is trying to
*33:08.980- 33:14.960* :  raise £200,000 to cover the cost of a new permanent enclosure. It has worked with a number of
*33:14.960- 33:19.920* :  rescued bears before, but none of them have drawn quite so much attention as YAMPLES.
*33:20.220- 33:21.180* :  Jamie McIver.
*33:24.280- 33:29.580* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*33:29.580- 33:36.300* :  at the same time tomorrow. This edition was mixed by Davyth Evans, and the producer was Emma
*33:36.300- 33:42.120* :  Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson, until next time, goodbye.

*33:56.060- 34:02.140* :  imminent abdication of Denmark's Queen Magrater and the country's new king mean for all of Europe's
