*01:48.000- 01:58.120* :  from the BBC World Service. I'm Charles Haveland and at four hours GMT on Friday the 12th of January,
*01:58.120- 02:04.560* :  these are our main stories. The US and the UK have carried out military strikes against
*02:04.560- 02:11.720* :  who the rebel targets in Yemen. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says hypocrisy and
*02:11.720- 02:17.580* :  lies are behind the court case at the Hague in which his country is accused of committing genocide
*02:17.660- 02:24.840* :  in Gaza. Researchers say they've found the ruins of a vast ancient city in the Ecuadorian
*02:24.840- 02:28.580* :  Amazon. The change is everything known about the history of the region.
*02:32.020- 02:37.320* :  Also in this podcast, one of my vendors was selling something else and she said at the end of
*02:37.320- 02:41.520* :  the conversation, I've got a couple of friend scripts, do you think they'll sell? And I of course
*02:41.520- 02:46.660* :  went, yes, bring them in, bring them in because I love friends. 25 years after they were thrown
*02:46.660- 02:51.480* :  in a bin, original scripts from the hit US sitcom are up for auction.
*02:56.280- 03:01.900* :  Israel's three month war against Hamas in Gaza has increasingly been making waves in the wider
*03:01.900- 03:07.320* :  region and nowhere more than in the Red Sea, where the Houthi rebels who control much of Yemen
*03:07.740- 03:12.160* :  have been retaliating against Israel by attacking cargo ships with drones and missiles.
*03:13.120- 03:17.940* :  Hundreds of shipping companies have been forced to divert vessels around the Cape of Good Hope,
*03:17.940- 03:23.980* :  a much longer route and far more expensive. A US-led naval coalition was deployed to the Red Sea
*03:23.980- 03:30.480* :  to protect ships, but the Houthis paid no attention. Now, by night, the US and Britain supported
*03:30.480- 03:36.280* :  by Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands have carried out missile strikes on Houthi targets,
*03:36.280- 03:42.080* :  reportedly hitting the capital Sanaa and the port of Hadehada. The White House confirmed the
*03:42.080- 03:47.740* :  strikes in a statement. These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and
*03:47.740- 03:53.940* :  our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperial freedom
*03:53.940- 03:59.200* :  of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes. Our Washington correspondent
*03:59.200- 04:05.160* :  Will Vernon told me more about the Allied military strikes. We heard in that White House statement
*04:05.160- 04:11.200* :  that these strikes were, according to the President, successful and a direct response to what he
*04:11.200- 04:16.260* :  called unprecedented Houthi attacks against international shipping. We shortly thereafter
*04:17.080- 04:21.380* :  heard from the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He said that the strikes targeted
*04:21.380- 04:28.480* :  the Houthis drone and missile capabilities, as well as coastal radar and air surveillance systems.
*04:28.480- 04:34.560* :  And the Reuters news agency said that there had been a number of explosions, quoted witnesses saying
*04:34.560- 04:40.020* :  they had seen and heard explosions in several different cities, and quoted a Houthi official,
*04:40.560- 04:45.800* :  who also said that there had been strikes on a number of cities. And this comes amid repeated
*04:45.800- 04:50.640* :  warnings, as you were saying there, in your introduction from Western officials, that if these
*04:50.640- 04:56.220* :  attacks on international shipping do not stop attacks on one of the most critical shipping
*04:56.220- 05:01.340* :  routes in the world, then there will be serious consequences. And I think that's what we're seeing
*05:01.340- 05:06.720* :  tonight. Indeed, there have been warnings, but on the other hand, for weeks, the Secretary of
*05:06.720- 05:12.460* :  State, Anthony Blinken, has been trying to calm things down most recently in his latest tour of
*05:12.460- 05:17.680* :  the Middle East, which is just winding up. He's saying he didn't want the conflict to spread.
*05:18.120- 05:20.100* :  So isn't this really a massive U-turn?
*05:21.340- 05:26.200* :  You're right, Secretary Blinken is just returning now from his latest Middle Eastern tour,
*05:26.200- 05:32.440* :  and he met a number of leaders during those visits, including the Saudi Crown Prince, the Israeli
*05:32.440- 05:38.240* :  Prime Minister, a number of others. And his state of aim on that tour was to try and avoid this
*05:38.620- 05:44.660* :  conflict between Israel and Hamas from spreading, from dragging in all kinds of regional players.
*05:44.660- 05:49.260* :  But I think the narrative that we're going to see play out in the next few days is that this is
*05:49.260- 05:54.340* :  a defensive mission. Indeed, we've just heard from a senior administration official here in Washington,
*05:54.340- 05:59.780* :  who said that we have no doubt that ships would have been struck, perhaps even sunk, including in
*05:59.780- 06:05.220* :  one case, a commercial ship full of jet fuel, which is quite a frightening prospect, isn't it?
*06:05.260- 06:09.960* :  So I think that that's going to be the messaging from the White House, from the Pentagon,
*06:09.960- 06:14.660* :  in the next few days, that the US was forced into this in order to protect itself and its allies.
*06:15.480- 06:20.300* :  Well, a hoody leader in Yemen, who, saying Al-Ezzi, has confirmed the attacks,
*06:20.300- 06:26.920* :  and warned the assailants will pay a heavy price. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has said that
*06:26.920- 06:33.600* :  the attacks are a cause for great concern. The hoodies are heavily armed. I asked our
*06:33.600- 06:38.180* :  international editor, Jeremy Bowen, how effective these allied strikes might be.
*06:39.000- 06:43.740* :  I don't think the hoothies will be overly worried about American British military action.
*06:43.740- 06:48.980* :  They've weathered quite a considerable storm from the Saudis since 2015, when the Saudis
*06:49.140- 06:54.120* :  intervened in the war in Yemen. The year before the hoothies had taken power in the capital city,
*06:54.200- 06:58.400* :  and controlled a good part of the country as they still do, including the coast and the ports,
*06:58.400- 07:03.780* :  on the Red Sea. I've spent quite a bit of time with the hoothies in Yemen, and they're defiant.
*07:03.780- 07:10.300* :  They go their own way. They're also very religious. Their slogans include death to America,
*07:10.300- 07:15.780* :  death to Israel. I think they want to be in the fight, actually. And they have said that they
*07:15.780- 07:21.540* :  are intervening because they're supporting the Palestinians against their great enemy Israel.
*07:22.240- 07:26.900* :  Given that, position the hoothies take, that they see themselves as acting on behalf of
*07:26.900- 07:34.660* :  garsens in the face of the Israeli attacks, how much or how little support in the region might
*07:34.660- 07:39.300* :  any Western-led military action over the Red Sea situation attract.
*07:40.120- 07:43.980* :  Well, it's going to have quite a bit of support clearly in Israel. It's going to have quite a bit
*07:43.980- 07:49.480* :  of support in Saudi Arabia, in the corridors of power, in the palaces of the ruling family,
*07:50.120- 07:54.880* :  and in the other ruling families' palaces, I think, in the Arabian Peninsula. However,
*07:54.880- 08:01.340* :  Poles in Saudi Arabia have suggested that the vast, vast majority of Saudis are very pro
*08:01.780- 08:07.580* :  the Palestinians very, very against what Israel is doing. And so I think they'll be happy
*08:07.580- 08:13.800* :  seeing hoothie defiance. And I think the perception of what the British and the Americans do
*08:13.800- 08:20.720* :  militarily will be among people in Arab countries and others in the so-called global south,
*08:20.720- 08:24.620* :  you know, a bit of an unfortunate phrase, but sort of tells its own story.
*08:24.780- 08:31.880* :  We'll be, here they are, moving from diplomatic and logistical support for Israel,
*08:32.200- 08:36.140* :  to actually entering the war on Israel's side. I think many people will see it that way too.
*08:36.580- 08:39.380* :  So what might then be the repercussions?
*08:39.660- 08:44.860* :  I think that actually there's a lot of fear about the war spreading, but what we have to say is
*08:44.860- 08:50.680* :  the war has spread. It's happening. The only bright spot in all of this, I suppose, is that it's
*08:50.680- 08:56.360* :  still at a relatively low level. It could get much worse, but it has spread. It's not just spreading
*08:56.360- 09:03.800* :  to the hoothies, Yemen. There are pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and in Syria who are attacking the
*09:03.800- 09:08.580* :  Americans who still have troops there. There's everything, of course, that's happening around
*09:08.580- 09:14.720* :  Gaza and there is an increasing risk of an escalation between Israel and the Lebanese
*09:14.720- 09:20.800* :  militia political group back by Iran and his brother. Our international editor, Jeremy Boin.
*09:21.600- 09:27.740* :  Jonathan Marcus is a defense analyst and military expert. I asked him if these allied strikes
*09:27.740- 09:33.860* :  will hinder the hootie attacks on cargo ships. It obviously depends on the number of targets hit
*09:33.860- 09:39.580* :  and the success of those strikes. We imagine that over recent weeks the United States and its
*09:39.580- 09:45.720* :  allies have been building up as best they can, an intelligence picture of the military infrastructure
*09:45.740- 09:51.620* :  at the hootie's disposal. Let's see, we would expect targets to have been launch sites, possibly
*09:51.620- 09:58.180* :  radar installations, missile storage facilities, maybe command and control facilities of some kind.
*09:58.180- 10:05.040* :  The danger, of course, is if the hooties do not halt the attacks on the shipping lanes in the Red
*10:05.040- 10:10.760* :  Sea, then the question is, are the United States and its allies going to launch a kind of rolling
*10:10.760- 10:16.960* :  air campaign against the hooties to try and force them into submission? And that, of course, risks
*10:16.960- 10:22.620* :  a significant widening of conflict in the region. What do you think will be the main obstacles
*10:22.620- 10:27.520* :  militarily speaking that the allied forces might face? I've heard that the hooties have
*10:27.520- 10:32.680* :  kept a lot of their armaments very much concealed and they're used to deploying them over the course
*10:32.680- 10:38.960* :  of nearly the past decade. Well, absolutely. And the hooties are not newcomers to the use of many
*10:38.960- 10:44.920* :  of the weapon systems that they're employing. They engaged in quite a successful missile war
*10:44.920- 10:51.300* :  against Saudi Arabia. It's possible, for example, that they could try to attack American installations
*10:51.360- 10:56.880* :  in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Gulf using long-range missiles. That's quite possible.
*10:57.180- 11:01.900* :  Obviously, they could step up missile attacks against the Israeli port of Elat,
*11:02.140- 11:07.400* :  quite apart from continuing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea. So, there are lots of things
*11:07.400- 11:13.860* :  they can do. Now, obviously, the Western warships have proved very capable so far in shooting down
*11:13.860- 11:20.500* :  a range of hootie weapons from unmanned drones to ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and so on.
*11:20.920- 11:26.140* :  Of course, all of the warships carry a relatively limited number of interceptor missiles,
*11:26.140- 11:31.500* :  so there will be logistical questions for the United States and its allies to keep the
*11:31.500- 11:37.920* :  arsenals of their warships topped up. Once again, when you embark upon military action of a kind of
*11:37.920- 11:43.720* :  punitive, diswazive kind, you have to wait and let the dust settle to see what the impact is,
*11:43.740- 11:50.220* :  but I frankly think it's unlikely that the hooties are simply going to back down after one series
*11:50.220- 11:56.360* :  of strikes. The hooties are very strong allies of Iran. Is there a danger Iran may get sucked
*11:56.360- 12:02.600* :  in in any way? The Iranians will be wary about being drawn in themselves, but I think they'll also
*12:02.600- 12:08.620* :  be very happy if the hooties can continue to prove a significant irritant to the United States and
*12:08.620- 12:13.940* :  its allies. And of course, the biggest irritant, if you like, is not necessarily the direct military
*12:13.940- 12:19.160* :  threat. It's the implied threat which affects commercial shipping with the commercial shipping
*12:19.160- 12:25.680* :  lines, re-routing their vessels, going round Africa, taking longer, costing more money, and potentially
*12:25.680- 12:32.160* :  damaging Western supply chains and Western commerce. So, you know, the stakes here are very
*12:32.160- 12:38.120* :  significant indeed. Jonathan Marcus, and now with the rest of the global news pod, here's Janat
*12:38.120- 12:44.060* :  Jelil. Israel's Prime Minister has described accusations of genocide against his government as being
*12:44.060- 12:50.480* :  based on hypocrisy and lies. Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking after South Africa, whose A&C
*12:50.480- 12:55.840* :  government has long supported the Palestinian cause, outlined its case to the UN's top court,
*12:55.840- 13:02.080* :  alleging that Israel's military offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide. Mr Netanyahu said listening
*13:02.080- 13:07.580* :  to the first day of arguments in the Hague was like being in an upside-down world. He insisted that
*13:07.580- 13:13.600* :  his country was, in fact, battling genocide by Hamas after the massacres of October 7th.
*13:15.180- 13:20.980* :  A terrorist organization committed the most terrible crime against the Jewish people since the
*13:20.980- 13:27.620* :  Holocaust, and now there are those who come to defend it in the name of the Holocaust. What audacity?
*13:29.860- 13:34.260* :  But lawyers for South Africa told the International Court of Justice in the Hague that Israel was
*13:34.260- 13:40.860* :  acting with genocidal intent. According to Hamas officials, the war has killed one percent of
*13:40.860- 13:46.100* :  the population of Gaza in three months. The South African Justice Minister, Ronald Limola,
*13:46.100- 13:51.360* :  accused Israel of intentionally unleashing suffering on civilians in the Gaza Strip.
*13:51.860- 13:56.560* :  The world has watched in horror as Palestinian men, women and children were slaughtered,
*13:56.660- 14:02.400* :  blown up, buried alive, under the rubble of their homes, left to die painful deaths and in
*14:02.400- 14:08.140* :  unresolved hospitals, resulting in over 23,000 deaths through destruction to homes, schools,
*14:08.140- 14:12.060* :  hospitals, water, treatment plans and other public infrastructure.
*14:13.260- 14:17.680* :  The Genocide Convention was enacted in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust.
*14:18.400- 14:24.400* :  It defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
*14:24.400- 14:30.160* :  ethnical, racial or religious group. Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams considers whether
*14:30.160- 14:35.040* :  South Africa will be able to prove that Israel's offensive in Gaza meets that threshold.
*14:35.760- 14:40.940* :  The last three months have been shocking enough, but to hear it all summed up by South Africa's lawyers
*14:40.940- 14:46.220* :  is still devastating. How many wonder can this not be a story of genocide?
*14:47.140- 14:51.740* :  But the 1948 definition, which so accurately describes the horrors of the Holocaust
*14:51.740- 14:57.360* :  that had so recently ended, is an incredibly high bar to clear. The South African
*14:57.360- 15:03.300* :  team knows it has a legal mountain to climb. There has to be evidence of intent by those responsible
*15:03.300- 15:07.860* :  for Israel's military campaign, and there has to be a pattern of behaviour by its troops,
*15:08.320- 15:12.260* :  which cannot reasonably be explained as anything other than genocidal.
*15:13.040- 15:17.300* :  Israel will make its case. Its high-powered delegation includes Ahar Ambarak,
*15:17.300- 15:23.160* :  Israel's former chief justice, and himself a Holocaust survivor. The implication perhaps
*15:23.160- 15:29.200* :  Israel understands the true face of genocide. It'll be three or four years before the court
*15:29.200- 15:33.440* :  decides whether Israel is guilty, but much sooner than that, perhaps within weeks,
*15:33.440- 15:38.920* :  it could demand that Israel halt its military campaign to avoid inflicting further harm on
*15:38.920- 15:44.920* :  Palestinian civilians. Israel determined to pursue its goal of destroying Hamas as a political
*15:44.920- 15:50.480* :  and military force would almost certainly ignore the court's ruling. There's nothing the ICJ
*15:50.480- 15:56.340* :  can do to enforce it, but a judgment by the UN's top legal authority could add to the pressure
*15:56.340- 16:02.880* :  mounting on Israel to change the way it acts in Gaza. Paul Adams, many of those killed in Gaza
*16:02.880- 16:07.760* :  have been children. The Hamas-run health ministry says 40% of those who've died have been under
*16:07.760- 16:12.660* :  the age of 18. But even before the current war, those growing up in Gaza had lived through
*16:12.660- 16:19.280* :  multiple rounds of fighting between Palestinian armed groups in Israel. Back in 2021, the BBC reported
*16:19.280- 16:25.080* :  on a girl called Nadine Abdul Latif. Now 13, she's become a popular vlogger and has been
*16:25.080- 16:29.940* :  describing how during this conflict, her brother was killed during an Israeli air strike,
*16:29.940- 16:34.840* :  and her family forced from their home. Here's our BBC Middle East correspondent, Yorland Now.
*16:37.460- 16:40.220* :  That is the sound we hear every night. Did you hear that?
*16:40.500- 16:46.800* :  Hunker down in her apartment, this was an Instagram video by Nadine Abdul Latif in the early days of the war.
*16:46.940- 16:52.080* :  The vlog around us is being attacked. We don't know which building is going to be under attack,
*16:52.780- 16:59.120* :  but a lot of people out in the streets are screaming and we are not sure what's going to happen.
*16:59.720- 17:05.380* :  She filmed her world being shattered. Her neighborhood of Gaza City pounded by Israeli bombs.
*17:05.380- 17:10.960* :  This is my home. This is my home. Look how it looks like now.
*17:11.900- 17:16.620* :  Soon, like hundreds of thousands of others, she was forced to flee towards the south.
*17:17.240- 17:23.520* :  We've left our houses three times, from Gaza to Lusta to Lusta to Rafa.
*17:24.000- 17:27.720* :  Now Nadine tells me of her own terrible loss in this war.
*17:28.140- 17:34.060* :  Losing my brother was the worst moment of my life. I mean, he was my dear brother. He was
*17:34.400- 17:39.800* :  everything that I loved. He was always by my side. We would always go out together.
*17:41.340- 17:47.520* :  Out there from the war. During a previous conflict in 2021,
*17:48.320- 17:52.420* :  school was cancelled and Nadine began making videos for social media.
*17:53.120- 17:57.520* :  One clip of her, distraught by the rubble of her neighbor's house, went viral.
*17:58.380- 18:02.400* :  I don't know what to do. I'm just 10. I'm just 10.
*18:04.360- 18:10.120* :  Children stand all day and wait for them to be able to get water for their family.
*18:11.380- 18:15.540* :  Again, during the three long months of this war, Nadine's been showing the trauma
*18:15.540- 18:20.900* :  and struggle for children who make up half of the 2.3 million people in Gaza.
*18:21.540- 18:28.320* :  I saw these two children selling cans of food in the ring. They might get sick, but this is our way.
*18:28.920- 18:30.940* :  And there are the daily indignities.
*18:37.380- 18:41.980* :  Nadine's long hoped to be a doctor, but now she can barely contemplate the future.
*18:42.480- 18:47.620* :  It's not living anymore, just existing. We don't have hopes anymore. We don't go to school.
*18:47.620- 18:51.700* :  We don't do anything. We just sit here and watch and do the stuff.
*18:52.640- 18:55.280* :  It just exists and that is horrible.
*18:56.940- 19:01.760* :  Every day feels dangerous in Gaza. And with so much grief and devastation,
*19:02.280- 19:08.520* :  even when the violence stops, its young generation will find it hard to pick up the pieces of their lives.
*19:09.860- 19:15.160* :  Yolanda Nell. The former US President Donald Trump has reiterated his belief that his
*19:15.160- 19:20.040* :  civil fraud case is a political witch hunt on the closing day of the trial in New York.
*19:20.740- 19:25.300* :  Mr. Trump has already been found guilty of inflating the value of his properties to secure
*19:25.300- 19:30.840* :  favourable loans. The trial is looking at other counts such as conspiracy and falsification
*19:30.840- 19:36.500* :  of business records. On North America correspondent Netatorfic sent this report from outside the court.
*19:37.680- 19:41.000* :  In court, Donald Trump's lawyer echoed the former president's claims.
*19:41.000- 19:44.840* :  Chris Keiss said the case had been manufactured for political reasons,
*19:44.840- 19:48.920* :  and that the attorney general was trying to put Mr. Trump out of business.
*19:48.940- 19:54.140* :  He argued that the accusations didn't make sense, because Deutsche Bank had rolled out
*19:54.140- 19:59.180* :  the red carpet to give Mr. Trump loans, that he didn't need to inflate the worth of his assets
*19:59.180- 20:04.560* :  and the loans were paid back. The judge has banned Mr. Trump from addressing the court himself,
*20:04.560- 20:09.640* :  because he's failed to agree to limits on what he could say. So the former president made a
*20:09.680- 20:14.180* :  statement outside. So which hunt in the true sense of the word? It's election interference.
*20:15.240- 20:20.240* :  And so it's all a conspiracy to try and get Biden who can't put two sentences together,
*20:20.240- 20:25.500* :  trying to get him into office. So I just want to let you know that we have our best poll numbers,
*20:25.500- 20:29.960* :  we have the best everything, despite this, and maybe because of this, because the people of the
*20:29.960- 20:34.680* :  United States, all of those people back there, but the people of the United States really get it,
*20:34.680- 20:39.020* :  they get it better than anybody else. Judge has previously disagreed with the defense.
*20:39.020- 20:43.920* :  He said lenders could have been damaged by lending at a lower interest rate than they would have,
*20:43.920- 20:49.380* :  if Mr. Trump's assets had been valued correctly. Prosecutors argue that the former president
*20:49.380- 20:54.580* :  used a myriad of deceptive schemes that were so outrageous, they belied innocent explanation.
*20:54.640- 20:57.140* :  The judge will issue a verdict at a later date.
*20:59.460- 21:05.080* :  Now to the tiny unspoiled Caribbean island of Barbuda. Some residents there fear that the
*21:05.080- 21:09.220* :  arrival of new multi-million dollar tourist results and an international airport
*21:09.220- 21:14.440* :  will threaten their culture and way of life. Others see them as bringing much-needed jobs in
*21:14.440- 21:20.120* :  development. Caroline Bailey has been to Barbuda, the smaller of the two islands state of Antiga
*21:20.120- 21:23.940* :  and Barbuda to find out what the future holds for this island paradise.
*21:24.920- 21:30.480* :  From a beautiful pink sandy beach, environmentalist John Mussington points out two private
*21:30.480- 21:35.640* :  resorts at either end of Barbuda's southern coast. It's known as the Barbuda Ocean Club,
*21:35.640- 21:39.880* :  and they're building hundreds of multi-million dollar residences and a golf course.
*21:40.520- 21:43.700* :  Luxury properties are built, golf courses are going to be built,
*21:45.000- 21:50.420* :  sale of these luxury properties and put them behind fence for persons living private lifestyle
*21:50.960- 21:57.140* :  will mean large areas of resources, we depend on for livelihood, will no longer be available to us.
*21:57.920- 22:02.280* :  John is worried about the environmental impact, as the larger of the two resorts
*22:02.280- 22:08.280* :  is within an area declared by the Intergovernmental Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international
*22:08.280- 22:15.140* :  significance. The developers leading the project, the American firms PLH Barbuda Limited and the
*22:15.140- 22:21.020* :  Discovery Land Company declined our request for an interview, but said in a statement that the
*22:21.020- 22:27.000* :  project was approved in a transparent and inclusive process, and that they're doing a lot of
*22:27.000- 22:32.700* :  environmental work including restoring wetlands, and also that they've created hundreds of jobs
*22:32.700- 22:38.880* :  for Barbudans. But John has taken the government to court over another aspect of the project,
*22:38.880- 22:44.360* :  the construction of an airport in the middle of the island, which he says is in an environmentally
*22:44.380- 22:51.760* :  sensitive area. No proper environmental impact assessment was done when an impact assessment
*22:52.500- 22:57.100* :  turned up, the review by the Department of Environment said it was totally inadequate.
*22:57.940- 23:03.060* :  The case has been heard at the Privy Council in London, Antiga and Barbuda's highest court.
*23:03.060- 23:08.680* :  If John wins, he'll have the right that's been denied to him to challenge the project and call
*23:08.680- 23:14.100* :  for a judicial review, where a judge would look at the lawfulness of the process. But others,
*23:14.100- 23:19.800* :  like local businesswoman Kelcina George, who runs Barbuda cottages, see the high end
*23:19.800- 23:26.320* :  resorts as good for the island's economy. They've hired a lot of Barbudans, all the young people,
*23:26.720- 23:32.040* :  everyone went to work there, and from what I gather, they're pretty happy with the money.
*23:33.240- 23:38.460* :  And that's what the government based in Antiga says is the priority. Charles Fernandez is the
*23:38.460- 23:45.520* :  tourism and investment minister. Well, I think it's a vision of the government to bring Barbuda
*23:46.080- 23:51.580* :  to a level where it has full employment. Barbuda is going to generate when it's
*23:52.420- 23:56.180* :  fully operational. It's going to generate a tremendous amount in taxes.
*23:58.700- 24:03.200* :  Barbuda is not alone. Around the world, there are similar battles taking place,
*24:03.200- 24:08.920* :  as small paradise communities in beautiful locations attempt to balance economic
*24:08.920- 24:14.260* :  need against protecting their own cultures. Caroline Bailey reporting from the Caribbean
*24:14.260- 24:21.260* :  island of Barbuda. Syltacom, scientists use both excavations and
*24:21.260- 24:27.040* :  grand penetrating lasers to find these vast remains in the Amazonian rainforest in eastern Ecuador.
*24:27.740- 24:32.260* :  The huge ancient city believed to have been built two and a half thousand years ago.
*24:36.280- 24:42.220* :  Some people play golf on the weekends. I hunt con artists. Unmissible podcasts from the BBC World

*25:06.360- 25:13.200* :  a brand to. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Tens of thousands of opposition supporters
*25:13.200- 25:18.760* :  have held an anti-government demonstration in the Polish capital Warsaw. The rally outside
*25:18.760- 25:23.520* :  parliament was called by the Law and Justice Party which lost elections last October.
*25:24.200- 25:29.080* :  The demonstrators were protesting against the new government's imprisonment of two former ministers
*25:29.500- 25:34.020* :  who have been convicted of abusing their powers when they headed an anti-corruption agency.
*25:34.740- 25:38.700* :  President Anjay Duda had pardoned the men for the crimes in 2015,
*25:39.340- 25:42.280* :  but last year the Supreme Court ruled the pardon was invalid,
*25:42.280- 25:46.640* :  something the president disputes. As Adam Eastern reports from Warsaw,
*25:47.160- 25:50.840* :  he's now started the process to once again pardon the two men.
*25:55.160- 26:00.320* :  Tusk to prison the demonstrators chanted. They mean Donald Tusk, the country's new prime minister
*26:00.320- 26:06.040* :  in political enemy number one of opposition law and justice supporters. Many of them are angry
*26:06.040- 26:10.120* :  about the way Mr Tusk has started undoing the controversial reforms of the law and justice
*26:10.120- 26:17.800* :  government that recently lost power after eight years in office. I am a poll and I think what's
*26:17.800- 26:24.840* :  happening harms Poland and is illegal above all, taking over public television and imprisoning
*26:24.840- 26:29.860* :  people who have parliamentary immunity and forcing the president to pardon them again.
*26:30.300- 26:34.680* :  She's talking about Maniusz Kaminsky and Maché von Schick, who were convicted last month
*26:34.680- 26:39.440* :  of abusing their powers when they led an anti-corruption agency. After a court ordered police
*26:39.440- 26:43.960* :  to take them into custody earlier this week, they briefly sheltered in the presidential palace
*26:43.960- 26:49.040* :  at President Duda's invitation. President Duda refused to recognize the court ruling,
*26:49.040- 26:54.320* :  saying he'd already pardoned the men for the crimes, but his original pardon was legally
*26:54.320- 26:59.740* :  disputed. As the men said they were starting a hunger strike in prison, President Duda said he
*26:59.740- 27:06.240* :  would issue a fresh pardon to allow them to be released. Adam Easton impolined. The jailed Russian
*27:06.240- 27:11.500* :  opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has long complained of the harsh treatment he receives in
*27:11.500- 27:16.840* :  prison, being frequently put in a punishment cell, being denied access to medical treatment
*27:16.840- 27:22.800* :  and even attempts to poison him. So his supporters were alarmed when he disappeared for several
*27:22.800- 27:28.460* :  weeks at the end of last year. They eventually tracked him to a remote penal colony in the Russian
*27:28.460- 27:34.260* :  Arctic. This week, in his first public appearance since then, he saw a Supreme Court judge by video
*27:34.260- 27:39.300* :  link that he should be allowed access to proper meal breaks and more books in prison.
*27:43.900- 27:48.680* :  You come right set that I have 10 books and there are religious books among those 10 books.
*27:48.780- 27:54.740* :  I need two books for their constant practice of my religion. My religion is orthodox Christianity
*27:54.780- 28:01.060* :  and any representative of the orthodox religion will tell you that more than one book is needed
*28:01.060- 28:07.600* :  for daily practice. One book is not enough for me. This violates my religious rights. It violates
*28:07.600- 28:14.220* :  my rights to study. I asked our Russia analyst with TaliShivchenko how Mr Navalny appeared during
*28:14.220- 28:20.500* :  the court hearing. Well, he looked haggard, which is not surprising given the circumstances,
*28:20.560- 28:28.740* :  but also both when he appeared via video link from his Arctic colony on Wednesday and today on
*28:28.740- 28:35.160* :  Thursday. He looked upbeat. He was smiling. He made some jokes, which of course will be a source
*28:35.160- 28:43.160* :  of inspiration to his followers and supporters. And also it will ease the concerns and fears,
*28:43.160- 28:51.520* :  which emerged after Mr Navalny disappeared in early December and none of his lawyers and supporters
*28:51.520- 29:00.720* :  knew where he was. So he's back. He is reasonably well as far as we can tell. He is able to
*29:01.600- 29:11.880* :  continue to argue his cases in court. So today his case was focused on prison rules such as
*29:12.260- 29:21.880* :  the limit on the number of books inmates can have in their cells. And also he complained against
*29:22.060- 29:29.640* :  a prison rule, which said that you have only a certain amount of time to consume your hot meals.
*29:30.260- 29:36.760* :  And according to him, that amount of time in practical terms was usually reduced to 15 minutes.
*29:36.760- 29:42.140* :  And he said that inmates burned themselves because they were in such a hurry to eat their meals.
*29:42.540- 29:50.500* :  And unsurprisingly, those complains were rejected. So he's been able to achieve very little with
*29:50.500- 29:57.260* :  his cases, but at least he's trying. And he's also showing them that he remains defiant
*29:57.260- 30:02.940* :  that the Russian authorities and these draconian conditions that he's been kept in have not broken
*30:03.640- 30:10.720* :  which I suppose is the reason why he was sent to jail in the first place. Mr Navalny is arguably
*30:10.720- 30:19.740* :  Russia's most active, prominent, and effective, a position figure. And now he's in jail, which means
*30:19.740- 30:27.120* :  that President Putin is the only man on the top who will be able to run for re-election
*30:27.120- 30:35.200* :  later this year. All of his effective and credible opponents are either in jail,
*30:35.200- 30:42.200* :  such as Mr Navalny, or in exile, such as almost all of Mr Navalny's supporters, or dead,
*30:42.200- 30:46.280* :  such as Boris Nemsov, who was shot dead outside the Kremlin.
*30:46.840- 30:51.740* :  Vitaly Shevchenko. The Thai government says it will continue to allow a former Prime Minister,
*30:51.740- 30:56.440* :  who's supposed to be in jail, to serve his sentence in hospital. Officials had taxed in
*30:56.440- 31:02.500* :  Shinarot still needed close medical attention. Mickey Brister reports. The billionaire businessman
*31:02.500- 31:07.680* :  was initially sent to prison when he returned to Thailand from self-imposed exile last August.
*31:08.340- 31:14.040* :  At the 74-year-old was almost immediately transferred to hospital, complaining of tightness in his
*31:14.040- 31:20.300* :  chest. The government, run by a political party linked to Mr Taxing, says he can stay at the
*31:20.300- 31:26.440* :  luxury medical facility, just in case he needs treatment. The former PM is serving a one-year
*31:26.440- 31:32.320* :  jail term, and is eligible for parole next month, so he might never see the inside of a prison cell
*31:32.320- 31:38.020* :  again. Mickey Bristo. Now, cast your mind back to some of the supply chain problems during the
*31:38.020- 31:43.840* :  COVID-19 pandemic. A key concern was the availability of semi-conductors. Those computer chips
*31:43.840- 31:49.220* :  so vital for many of our electronic items. Well, since the pandemic, geopolitical tensions
*31:49.220- 31:55.820* :  have also affected this industry, with 90% of the world's most advanced chips made by TSMC
*31:55.820- 32:01.220* :  in Taiwan. So it will come as no surprise that countries all over the world are now investing
*32:01.220- 32:06.760* :  billions of dollars to try to make their own supply. Hannah Malayne visited a new factory
*32:06.760- 32:12.040* :  near the city of Durham in Northern England, where she met David Moore, the chief executive of
*32:12.040- 32:17.800* :  the Pragmatic semi-conductor company. We get started? Yeah, let's start it. Okay, let's go to
*32:17.820- 32:23.800* :  this first. I had to put my safety gear on. Does it matter that I can't put my helmet on my head
*32:23.800- 32:30.960* :  with these headphones? You can get me a very large one. After we managed to find a helmet big enough
*32:30.960- 32:37.380* :  to accommodate my head and my headphones, we were ready to go. Well, welcome again. So this is
*32:37.640- 32:44.500* :  Pragmatic Park. This is Pragmatic's newest manufacturing site for flexible integrated circuit
*32:44.500- 32:53.860* :  technologies. So unlike silicon, we make what is a ultra-thin, very flexible, low-cost, sustainable,
*32:54.680- 32:59.540* :  alternative to those silicon chips. These are essentially eight inches wide, and so they got a
*32:59.540- 33:04.640* :  certain number of chips to it. You can see the tiny little rectangles there. Each of those is a chip.
*33:06.140- 33:10.780* :  And so what's really special about it is that it's flexible. Yeah, and I'm feeling it, and it feels
*33:10.780- 33:15.300* :  like the kind of film I might wrap a Christmas gift deal. Yes, yes, you could. It's really,
*33:15.300- 33:22.140* :  right, right, for those really nerdy family members who want, so we can talk about Christmas gifts.
*33:22.140- 33:27.180* :  No, absolutely, it is, it is that, I mean, ultimately what's laid on is essentially what's called
*33:27.180- 33:32.080* :  polymide. It's a face-to-face plastic. This is like a big dinner plate and a small side plate,
*33:32.220- 33:37.960* :  I guess, in terms of size. It just feels crazy to think that there is so many chips in that,
*33:37.960- 33:43.100* :  that it can be used in tech. It doesn't feel like tech when I look at it. It doesn't feel like
*33:43.180- 33:48.020* :  absolutely so metal things going into phones and things like that. Exactly, exactly. It's quite a
*33:48.180- 33:53.240* :  different thing to see in person. It's extremely unique. So that tin film technology enables that
*33:53.240- 33:57.920* :  obviously be flexible and really thin. So a silicon chip in your cell phone or your laptop,
*33:57.920- 34:04.360* :  they have their role to play, but if you want to be able to embed these into products that
*34:04.360- 34:08.780* :  that need to be flexible and integrated into smart packaging and those applications,
*34:09.360- 34:13.820* :  that kind of flexible, thin form factor is a really unique thing.
*34:14.900- 34:19.380* :  It's the flexible nature of these chips, which means they can't be used in all the same places
*34:19.680- 34:24.080* :  that you might find the silicon kind. It's more likely that we'll see them in wearable health
*34:24.080- 34:30.000* :  technology for clothing authentication and in parcel labels to track and trace items. And for
*34:30.000- 34:37.100* :  such tiny items, you really need a huge space to make them. It's pretty big, isn't it?
*34:37.940- 34:46.000* :  This is a 16,000 square meter building. Obviously, it's got a feel of a very industrial kind of
*34:46.240- 34:52.020* :  facility to it. And it actually is a, you know, formerly was a ceramic pipe factory. And so
*34:52.060- 34:59.080* :  it's large. On a 15 acre site, we've got, you know, the 16,000 square meters. Ultimately,
*34:59.080- 35:05.900* :  the secret behind this is the ability to be able to take what is just, you know, at general
*35:06.680- 35:11.880* :  site here in the northeast. I'm be able to put semiconductor manufacturing into it. But if you take
*35:11.880- 35:18.240* :  a standard silicon, you know, manufacturing facility, first of all, they're going to be gigantic.
*35:18.240- 35:24.400* :  So, you know, many times the size of this, it's going to take multiple years and billions of
*35:24.400- 35:31.440* :  dollars. Typically, two silicon fabs will require a huge amount of energy. So TSMC, for example,
*35:31.440- 35:38.100* :  uses 5% of Taiwan's total energy supply every year. They use hundreds and hundreds of millions of
*35:38.500- 35:44.240* :  liters of water. They use very kind of complex chemicals and gases because of our unique
*35:44.300- 35:51.020* :  processing. It's ultimately more simple. And that makes it, you know, fundamentally more sustainable.
*35:52.200- 35:56.620* :  David Moore, the chief executive of Pragmatic, talking to Hannah Malayne.
*35:57.780- 36:03.580* :  A huge ancient city has been found in the eastern Amazon. Scientists had previously thought that
*36:03.580- 36:10.000* :  large settlements were only in highland areas of South America, like Machu Picchu in Peru.
*36:10.560- 36:17.080* :  Georgina Ranad reports. Scientists use both excavations and ground penetrating lasers to find
*36:17.080- 36:22.440* :  these vast remains in the Amazonian rainforests in eastern Ecuador. They believe they were built
*36:22.440- 36:28.640* :  two and a half thousand years ago. The city had around 6,000 mounds of platforms that made up homes
*36:28.640- 36:34.400* :  and places to conduct ceremonies. They were connected by many kilometers of long, straight roads.
*36:34.920- 36:39.240* :  Little is known about the people who lived there, except that they were farmers and their diet
*36:39.240- 36:45.140* :  included sweet potatoes and sweet beer. It's not known why the civilization ended, but eruptions
*36:45.140- 36:49.900* :  from a nearby volcano probably played a part. Georgina Ranad.
*36:51.100- 36:56.620* :  Original scripts from two episodes of the hit US sitcom Friends are going up for auction.
*36:56.620- 37:02.380* :  25 years after they were found in a bin. The scripts were meant to be destroyed to stop details
*37:02.380- 37:07.400* :  of a season finale leaking out before it was broadcast, but a worker on the set rescued them
*37:07.400- 37:12.600* :  and has kept them in a bedside drawer all these years. Their value has been estimated at about
*37:12.600- 37:17.360* :  a thousand dollars, but as Joe Black reports, they could sell for much more.
*37:23.100- 37:26.840* :  The scripts belong to one of Friends' most famous episodes,
*37:28.340- 37:33.940* :  which entertained millions in the 90s and early 90s. In it, Ross is marrying his British
*37:33.940- 37:40.820* :  fiancée Emily, but he messes up his wedding bouse and says, I take the Rachel, the name of his
*37:40.900- 37:45.860* :  on-off girlfriend throughout the series, drawing gasps of horror from the assembled guests.
*37:47.640- 37:51.060* :  So, two framed scripts, the one with Ross's wedding,
*37:51.140- 37:56.040* :  filmed at Fountain Studios and in Central London. Some of these scenes were filmed in London,
*37:56.500- 38:01.380* :  and now the scripts which were originally found in a bin after filming have been discovered
*38:01.380- 38:07.960* :  25 years on. They'll go under the hammer. Amanda Butler is from Hanson Ross, which is holding
*38:07.960- 38:13.260* :  the auction. One of my vendors was selling something else, and she said at the end of the conversation,
*38:14.200- 38:17.460* :  I've got a couple of friends scripts, do you think they'll sell? And I, of course, say, yes,
*38:17.480- 38:21.380* :  bring them in, bring them in, because I love friends. And she worked at Fountain Studios,
*38:21.920- 38:26.460* :  she found them in a bin, picked them up, took them home, and they'd been in her drawer for 25
*38:26.520- 38:30.860* :  years. The great thing about these scripts is that the casting crew were told to destroy them,
*38:30.920- 38:36.900* :  so that the ending wouldn't be leaked, and they're here. The auction houses received many calls.
*38:43.880- 38:45.400* :  That report by Joe Black.
*38:47.940- 38:52.300* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*38:52.500- 38:56.040* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.
*38:56.040- 39:03.680* :  The address is globalpodcast at BBC.co.uk. You can also find us on X at Global NewsPod.
*39:04.380- 39:09.520* :  This edition was mixed by Chris Ablaquois, the producer was Liam McSheffery, the editor is Karen
*39:09.520- 39:12.800* :  Martin. I'm Janet Joliel. Until next time, goodbye.
