*01:16.800- 01:20.080* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:20.140- 01:27.780* :  I'm Nick Karaci, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 24th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:27.780- 01:33.400* :  A projected win for Donald Trump in New Hampshire over Nikki Haley in the Republican primary,
*01:33.400- 01:41.060* :  but she vows to keep fighting. New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the
*01:41.060- 01:49.440* :  nation. She was up and I said, wow, she's doing like a speech like she won. She didn't win,
*01:49.440- 01:56.520* :  she lost. Also to come, the Turkish Parliament finally ratifies Sweden's bid to join NATO.
*01:57.300- 02:02.420* :  As Argentina prepares for a general strike, we have a profile of the controversial new president
*02:02.420- 02:08.100* :  Javier Millay. He talks to a dog that's been dead for six or seven years. He also says that the
*02:08.100- 02:12.220* :  dead dog communicates with God, and that God was the one who told him that he would be president.
*02:12.220- 02:15.480* :  His clone dogs are the ones that advise him on political decisions.
*02:18.700- 02:23.960* :  Also in this podcast, the murder rate in Haiti has more than doubled in the last 12 months
*02:23.960- 02:30.900* :  amid the rise in gang violence. And the wildlife park with feathered friends that have become
*02:30.900- 02:35.800* :  infamous. Are the relentless swearing parents? I will try my hardest to make sure that I disguise
*02:35.800- 02:39.800* :  anything that they say, but I am very close to them, but I don't think they'll swear while I've
*02:39.800- 02:46.160* :  got to celebrate my hand. So can the potty, mouthed parrots be taught to swear just a little less?
*02:53.180- 02:58.740* :  After his resounding victory in Iowa last week, it was widely expected that Donald Trump would
*02:58.740- 03:03.600* :  put off a similar feat in the New Hampshire Republican primary. At the time of recording this
*03:03.600- 03:08.540* :  podcast, the votes are still being counted, but US networks are reporting that Mr Trump has won
*03:08.540- 03:15.360* :  the state, defeating his only remaining challenger, Nikki Haley. The result is a significant victory for
*03:15.360- 03:20.920* :  the form of president and puts him in a commanding position to become the party's presidential candidate
*03:21.340- 03:27.340* :  in November. Shortly after the first projections came in, Ms. Haley conceded the race, but insisted
*03:27.340- 03:32.880* :  she'd keep going. I want to congratulate Donald Trump on his victory tonight. He earned it,
*03:33.520- 03:39.080* :  and I want to acknowledge that. Now you've all heard the chatter among the political class.
*03:40.120- 03:44.020* :  They're falling all over themselves saying this race is over.
*03:51.740- 04:00.620* :  Well, I have news for all of them. New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation.
*04:05.660- 04:11.660* :  Mr. Trump has also addressed his supporters, first he gave his reaction to Nikki Haley's remarks.
*04:12.260- 04:19.140* :  And she was up and I said, wow, she's doing like a speech like she won. She didn't win, she lost, and
*04:19.140- 04:26.980* :  you know, last week we had a little bit of a problem, and if you remember, Ron was very upset
*04:26.980- 04:33.980* :  because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, didn't she come
*04:33.980- 04:38.980* :  in third? Yeah, she came in third. At the time of recording this around half the votes have
*04:38.980- 04:45.160* :  been counted, and Donald Trump is estimated to have 54 percent of them with Nikki Haley on just
*04:45.160- 04:51.980* :  over 43 percent. But the former US representative Rodney Davis says the exact numbers aren't important.
*04:52.620- 04:58.700* :  I don't think it matters if she loses by one point or if she loses by 21 points. Donald Trump
*04:58.700- 05:04.180* :  would be able to sell this as a mandate, as a victory. Don't underestimate the Rhonda Santa's voter
*05:04.180- 05:10.120* :  going to Donald Trump. That was a big deal. We're all pulling throughout this entire election
*05:10.120- 05:15.540* :  process as shown that if you're not a Trump voter, you're a DeSantis voter and vice versa.
*05:16.040- 05:21.340* :  Nikki Haley's last stand was right here, I believe, in New Hampshire. If she could have had the
*05:21.340- 05:28.380* :  turnout of independent voters, who are legally able to go cast their vote, and they should be,
*05:28.820- 05:33.220* :  in a state like New Hampshire, if she would have had the McCain surge of 2000, she could have
*05:33.220- 05:38.420* :  kept it competitive. Remember, Bill Clinton lost New Hampshire. He also lost Iowa, but he was able
*05:38.420- 05:45.680* :  to say I'm the comeback kid, and then parlay that into momentum going into the South. I see Nikki Haley
*05:45.680- 05:53.800* :  getting clobbered in South Carolina after this. I got the latest from our correspondent Gary O'Donohue
*05:53.800- 05:59.980* :  in New Hampshire. The question of the margin will characterize this race, Nikki Haley has already
*05:59.980- 06:05.200* :  conceded Donald Trump as the winner. She has said that she will continue with the battle,
*06:05.200- 06:10.580* :  which I think suggests that at least her camp believe they've done reasonably well tonight.
*06:10.620- 06:15.160* :  They really didn't expect, I don't think, to actually win this. They expected what they
*06:15.160- 06:22.080* :  called a strong performance. If they can get close to single digits in terms of the difference
*06:22.080- 06:27.280* :  between them and Donald Trump, they will consider that as a significant step forward,
*06:27.780- 06:33.240* :  given where she started from. But Donald Trump is unquestionably dominant on polling station.
*06:33.300- 06:38.660* :  I've just come from in Manchester, which is sort of blue collar area, so he'd expected to be
*06:38.660- 06:45.520* :  strong Trump territory. He got 54% of the vote there in the Republican primary, so he is still
*06:45.520- 06:50.920* :  doing pretty strong, but he will be concerned that she's still in the race. What has turnout
*06:50.920- 06:55.940* :  looking like? Well, I haven't seen any official figures, but I can tell you from my one little corner
*06:55.940- 07:01.840* :  of the universe where I was. A turnout was really strong, so in this particular ward in Manchester,
*07:02.280- 07:07.680* :  the turnout was about 50% of registered voters in that one little ward, and that is incredibly
*07:07.680- 07:13.400* :  strong for a primary. And we're certainly getting an idea that that could be sort of reflected
*07:13.400- 07:17.980* :  across the state. And indeed, the Secretary of State, which is a sort of a state office here,
*07:17.980- 07:24.520* :  who runs the elections, he was predicting a very strong turnout, particularly in the Republican
*07:24.520- 07:29.240* :  primary. Obviously, the Democratic primary is very complicated here, and Joe Biden wasn't on
*07:29.240- 07:33.900* :  the ballot, and that's all very difficult. But in the Republican primary, he was expecting,
*07:33.900- 07:39.660* :  you know, 300 plus thousand turnout. Yeah, I've talked about the Democratic sides in a moment.
*07:39.660- 07:47.260* :  I suppose a single point victory for Donald Trump would style that as a victory anyway, wouldn't it?
*07:48.120- 07:52.820* :  Oh, yes, certainly a victory, but much narrower than he would have hoped and much narrower than
*07:52.820- 07:58.460* :  the polls had been showing. But we'll see if it sort of transpires. If it's, you know, low double
*07:58.460- 08:03.360* :  digits, 11, 12%, again, you know, I think the Haley campaign will think that's a pretty strong
*08:03.940- 08:10.820* :  and I know we have got South Carolina coming up, which will be important to Nikki Haley,
*08:10.820- 08:15.380* :  and she's stressed that she will stay in this campaign, but it was here she really had to make
*08:15.380- 08:20.180* :  some inroads, wasn't it? Yeah, but I mean, South Carolina is a really difficult one for her because
*08:20.180- 08:26.980* :  it's her home state. She was governor there twice for two terms, and she's trailing badly there
*08:27.180- 08:32.280* :  in the polls. Now she thinks she can turn that around, and the difficulty is if you stay in the
*08:32.280- 08:38.660* :  race and lose your home state primary badly, that's quite a, that's quite a difficult thing to
*08:38.660- 08:44.420* :  come back from, not just in, you know, in this race, but in the future. And with all this going on
*08:44.420- 08:48.740* :  with the Republicans, it might be easy to forget the Democratic primary has been taking place in
*08:48.740- 08:55.200* :  New Hampshire with one Joe Biden, not even on the ballot paper. It's almost too complicated to get
*08:55.200- 09:01.440* :  your head around this one, but the Democrats wanted to prevent New Hampshire from being the first
*09:01.440- 09:08.220* :  primary in the nation. However, the, the primaries tend to be right, well, I'll run by the states
*09:08.220- 09:13.520* :  themselves, not by the national political parties. So the New Hampshire went ahead with his primary,
*09:13.520- 09:18.880* :  in any case, the Democrats said, oh, we won't give you any delegates as a result of it. We want
*09:18.880- 09:24.540* :  South Carolina to be the first for anyway, the upshot is Joe Biden is a writing candidate in this
*09:24.540- 09:28.740* :  Democratic primary, which means voters have to know that there's a box at the bottom of the ballots
*09:28.740- 09:33.600* :  to write his name in those votes, then get counted. And there has been a big effort by Democratic
*09:33.600- 09:40.060* :  operatives to sort of mobilize that writing vote. So we'll see what happens, but it's a slightly
*09:40.060- 09:44.260* :  academic exercise to be honest. Gary O'Donohue in New Hampshire.
*09:45.500- 09:50.680* :  The Turkish Parliament has ratified Sweden's bid to join NATO by an overwhelming majority in a long
*09:50.680- 09:56.020* :  delayed vote. President Erdogan is expected to sign the legislation. Turkey had blocked the Nordic
*09:56.020- 10:01.660* :  country's membership, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants, which it designates as terrorists.
*10:02.120- 10:05.520* :  Our chief international correspondent, Olga Girin, is in Istanbul.
*10:05.980- 10:11.780* :  It's been a long, complicated road to get this far. It's almost two years since Sweden applied
*10:11.780- 10:17.900* :  for membership of NATO. And of course, all the member countries have to agree. Turkey put up a
*10:17.900- 10:25.160* :  series of roadblocks. In particular, President Erdogan was objecting to Sweden being as he sawed
*10:25.160- 10:32.440* :  too lenient on members of groups on Swedish soil that Turkey regards as terrorists, for example,
*10:32.460- 10:39.240* :  the Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK. Now he demanded, and got a change in Sweden, the country amended
*10:39.240- 10:45.680* :  its constitution and tightened its anti-terrorism laws. So that solved one of President Erdogan's
*10:45.680- 10:52.640* :  demands. But he has also linked agreeing Sweden joining NATO to the White House going ahead with
*10:52.640- 10:59.980* :  the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara. That had been delayed for some time. But President
*10:59.980- 11:05.980* :  Erdogan seems to believe that this will now go ahead. Now that he has stopped blocking NATO's
*11:05.980- 11:10.780* :  expansion. That would leave Hungary as the last remaining NATO member, which has not given
*11:10.780- 11:17.360* :  its approval. There are some indications that Hungary and Turkey had been coordinating their stance
*11:17.980- 11:23.660* :  on this. And there was an indication of progress with the Hungarian Prime Minister suddenly
*11:23.660- 11:29.200* :  inviting his Swedish counterpart to come to Hungary for negotiations on the issue.
*11:29.200- 11:35.640* :  So I would expect Hungary to fall into line on this quite soon. And for the expansion to go ahead,
*11:35.640- 11:41.480* :  an expansion that was forced on Sweden by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which forced
*11:41.480- 11:45.020* :  the country to abandon its decades-long policy of neutrality.
*12:03.520- 12:08.920* :  Last week's clear and repeated rejection of the two-state solution at the highest level of
*12:08.920- 12:14.460* :  the Israeli government is unacceptable. This refusal and the denial of the right to stay to
*12:14.460- 12:19.420* :  it to the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat
*12:19.420- 12:24.640* :  to global peace and security. The right of the Palestinian people to build their own fully
*12:24.640- 12:30.500* :  independent state must be recognized by all. And then a refusal to accept the two-state solution
*12:30.500- 12:36.340* :  by any party must be firmly rejected. In Gaza, Israeli tanks have surrounded the southern
*12:36.340- 12:41.020* :  city of Khan Yunus. Palestinians say their only root out of the intense fighting there has been
*12:41.020- 12:46.060* :  blocked, effectively leaving them trapped. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli soldiers
*12:46.060- 12:51.500* :  fire directly at the NASA hospital complex in the city, but the Israeli army is yet to respond.
*12:51.500- 12:56.980* :  Speaking via video at a news conference in Geneva, the World Health Organization spokesman Christian
*12:56.980- 13:01.360* :  Lint Meyer said those at the hospital complex are facing a dire situation.
*13:06.380- 13:10.960* :  And additionally, the situation of not having enough food, water and medical supplies.
*13:11.520- 13:16.760* :  20 hospitals are not functioning. All over Gaza, the patients and people seeking safety within
*13:16.760- 13:21.300* :  these facilities, not only are they now at risk, but also at newly injured people are being prevented
*13:21.300- 13:27.600* :  to reach the hospital and come in absolutely unacceptable and not what any health facility
*13:27.660- 13:32.260* :  anywhere in the world should go through. Striking a defiant note once again,
*13:32.260- 13:37.020* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed the war would not stop until his country
*13:37.020- 13:42.780* :  achieved total victory against Hamas. Despite this tough talk, the White House confirmed that
*13:42.780- 13:48.040* :  a top US official Brett McGurk is in the Middle East for talks about a new pause in the fighting.
*13:48.040- 13:51.160* :  Here's the National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.
*13:51.620- 13:55.620* :  Brett is in the region. He was in Cairo today as a matter of fact, and he'll have other
*13:55.620- 14:00.460* :  stops along the way. Certainly one of the things he's in the region talking about is the potential
*14:00.460- 14:05.720* :  for another hostage deal, which would require humanitarian pause of some length to get that done.
*14:05.920- 14:09.160* :  And that's definitely on the agenda. He'll also be talking about a range of other issues,
*14:09.160- 14:13.380* :  including humanitarian assistance, getting assessment of Israeli defense force operations,
*14:13.560- 14:16.640* :  and the protection of civilian life. I mean, there's a lot on his agenda.
*14:17.580- 14:21.020* :  We've been hearing more from our Middle East analyst Sebastien Asher.
*14:21.320- 14:26.080* :  There's definitely a sense of momentum happening. We heard before the announcement about Brett
*14:26.080- 14:32.760* :  McGurk that a Hamas group is in Cairo as well for talks. And Qatar, which has played a big role
*14:32.760- 14:38.520* :  in mediation with Egypt and with the US, has been talking things up as well, saying that they're
*14:38.520- 14:43.040* :  receiving lots of dialogue from both sides, which they're saying is, you know, a very good thing.
*14:43.760- 14:49.000* :  I mean, the problem is that there's still at least publicly a huge divide between what
*14:49.000- 14:55.360* :  the Israeli government is prepared to accept and what Hamas is prepared to accept on the other side.
*14:56.020- 15:04.900* :  We had a leaked report yesterday saying that Israel had come up with a potential plan for a two-month
*15:04.900- 15:08.980* :  ceasefire, which would see a stage release of all the hostages, but it still held.
*15:09.500- 15:14.040* :  And through that, a large number of Palestinian prisoners would also be released.
*15:14.640- 15:20.400* :  Now, we haven't had that confirmed officially. We've also haven't had an official response
*15:20.440- 15:28.240* :  from Hamas to the report, but there have been signed indications that Hamas is not accepting
*15:28.240- 15:32.840* :  that premise, but that would be where the deal goes. I mean, Hamas has publicly said
*15:33.720- 15:38.780* :  throughout that it is only going to give up all the hostages, but it still holds
*15:39.620- 15:46.260* :  for a complete end of the Israel offensive in Gaza and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops.
*15:46.260- 15:53.440* :  And essentially, allowing Hamas leaders, those who survive to remain in Gaza not to go into exile
*15:53.640- 15:58.300* :  as this leaked proposal has been suggesting. Sebastian Asher,
*15:58.880- 16:04.580* :  campaigners in Serbia have called for all maternity hospitals to allow pregnant women to be
*16:04.580- 16:10.040* :  accompanied during childbirth. It follows an alleged assault on a Roma mother in hospital
*16:10.060- 16:15.080* :  in the town of Sremska, Nietzsche, in which her newborn child died.
*16:15.680- 16:20.480* :  The woman said the doctor jumped on her stomach and insulted her ethnicity.
*16:21.280- 16:27.060* :  Dodd, a fan of it, is president of the European Roma Rights Center and is himself Serbian.
*16:27.200- 16:28.320* :  He spoke to Tim Franks.
*16:28.760- 16:35.860* :  Though deeply distressing, this is not a unique situation. This is just like illustration of the
*16:36.020- 16:42.720* :  childbirth related violence and discrimination that is vitally spread in the state hospitals in
*16:43.060- 16:49.520* :  Serbia. And her experience shed light on systematic issues with the healthcare system.
*16:49.520- 16:55.160* :  That's disproportionately affects marginalized community, such as Roma.
*16:55.160- 17:02.900* :  You can see that she very bravely shared her story on social media, seeking to raise awareness,
*17:03.240- 17:10.880* :  and then you could see how this resonated and many other women started to come out and
*17:10.880- 17:17.860* :  saying about the very similar situation they were experiencing in the hospitals.
*17:18.260- 17:23.900* :  And in particular in this one hospital, there was like public protest in Serbia
*17:23.900- 17:26.960* :  in support of what happened to her.
*17:27.260- 17:29.400* :  Would you say it's a nationwide phenomenon?
*17:29.920- 17:36.860* :  It's a nationwide, very old phenomenon, which is not correctly addressed now for centuries.
*17:36.860- 17:41.460* :  You know, and it's not just Serbia, it's Europe as a continent.
*17:41.460- 17:47.340* :  If you look at the reports from NGOs, but also from fundamental right agency,
*17:47.900- 17:52.280* :  you could read in their reports that this discrimination against Roma is
*17:52.520- 17:56.560* :  widespread and accessing healthcare in particular.
*17:56.560- 18:04.260* :  But in other areas, like just a decade ago, we had very terrible cases of forced
*18:04.320- 18:10.980* :  sterilization of Romani women in Czech Republic. And that also shows how serious this
*18:10.980- 18:13.080* :  systematic discrimination is.
*18:13.500- 18:17.880* :  Yorday Ivanovich, president of the European Roma Rights Center.
*18:18.880- 18:21.980* :  Frank Farrion, the German singer and music producer, who founded the
*18:21.980- 18:26.760* :  hugely successful disco group Boney M, has died at his home in Miami.
*18:27.300- 18:28.180* :  He was 82.
*18:28.180- 18:34.300* :  Frank Farrion formed the band in 1976, which went on to sell millions of records worldwide.
*18:34.860- 18:37.460* :  Our entertainment correspondent, Lizzo Misimba reports.
*18:41.500- 18:45.020* :  Frank Farrion was more than just the producer who founded Boney M.
*18:45.300- 18:48.820* :  He also sang the male vocals on all their hit records.
*18:51.760- 18:55.180* :  While the group's frontman Bobby Farrell leaps in to his voice.
*18:59.580- 19:05.660* :  In the 1970s, the band had nine top ten singles, including two number ones.
*19:06.220- 19:11.740* :  Frank Farrion believed their success was down to their music, having a timeless quality.
*19:12.160- 19:15.220* :  Boney M is evergreen. They have a lot of evergreen songs.
*19:15.260- 19:21.040* :  Mary Spolcher, Rivers of Babylon, from east to west, from west to east.
*19:21.040- 19:23.740* :  You can go everywhere. You'll listen Boney M music.
*19:24.620- 19:24.880* :  Still.
*19:25.240- 19:28.680* :  Born in southwestern Germany, Frank Farrion trained as a chef
*19:28.680- 19:33.800* :  while pursuing a musical career, first as a singer and then as a producer.
*19:34.340- 19:37.880* :  And he worked with stars ranging from meatloaf to Stevie Wonder.
*19:38.140- 19:39.240* :  I just called.
*19:40.320- 19:44.600* :  He became embroiled in controversy when he repeated his winning formula
*19:44.600- 19:50.260* :  of putting together a group which lip-synced to songs actually recorded by others.
*19:53.760- 19:57.700* :  But years fans of Millie the Nilly believed it was them performing,
*19:57.700- 20:02.580* :  and they became one of the most successful acts of the late 80s.
*20:03.140- 20:06.780* :  But they were later stripped of their Grammy Award for Best New Act,
*20:07.200- 20:11.420* :  when it was publicly revealed that neither of the two members of the group
*20:12.020- 20:13.980* :  actually sang on any of their hits.
*20:14.900- 20:19.660* :  Still, over the years, Frank Farrion sold hundreds of millions of records,
*20:20.200- 20:24.980* :  cementing his reputation as one of music's most successful producers.
*20:32.060- 20:35.940* :  He's Homer Zimbron, the life of Frank Farrion, who is died at the age of 82.
*20:39.600- 20:45.700* :  Still to come on the global news podcast, what has caused a sharp rise in measles across Europe?
*20:46.080- 20:50.900* :  I think it's down to the Covid pandemic between 2019 and 2022.
*20:50.900- 20:55.120* :  There was a quite steep fall-off in vaccination rates in children.

*22:08.460- 22:13.720* :  The United Nations says the number of homicides in Haiti more than doubled in 2023.
*22:13.740- 22:18.160* :  The new figures put Haiti among the most deadly countries in the world.
*22:18.160- 22:21.520* :  Here's our America's regional editor Leonardo Rocher.
*22:22.020- 22:28.800* :  A report by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says that almost 4,800 people were murdered
*22:28.800- 22:33.920* :  last year. Mr. Guterres said that he was appalled by the worsening level of violence.
*22:34.600- 22:39.840* :  Security has deteriorated sharply since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021,
*22:40.060- 22:44.120* :  which has led to unprecedented levels of lawlessness and violence.
*22:44.580- 22:49.780* :  Haiti's powerful criminal gang's control as much as 80% of the capital, Porto Prince.
*22:49.780- 22:55.600* :  An international security force led by Kenyan police and back by the UN is expected to arrive
*22:55.600- 22:58.140* :  in the next few months to try to restore order.
*22:59.120- 23:03.780* :  There's been what is being called an alarming increase in cases of measles across Europe
*23:03.780- 23:09.800* :  according to the World Health Organization. More than 42,000 infections were reported by member states
*23:09.800- 23:19.180* :  in 2023, compared to 941 in 2022, a 45-fold increase. Health chiefs are warning that cases are
*23:19.200- 23:24.220* :  still rising and say urgent measures are needed to prevent any further spread.
*23:24.220- 23:29.580* :  Our health reporter, Philippa Roxby, told Valerie Sanderson what has caused this surge?
*23:29.840- 23:36.600* :  The World Health Organization are saying it's down to the COVID pandemic between 2019 and 2022.
*23:36.600- 23:41.820* :  They can see that there was a quite steep fall off in vaccination rates in children.
*23:41.820- 23:48.200* :  There's a measles jab called the MMR. Normally, about 95% of children have to be fully immunized
*23:48.200- 23:54.900* :  against measles for it not to spread, but they can see that during the pandemic that fell to around 93-92%.
*23:54.900- 24:00.660* :  It doesn't seem a big fall, but that's enough because measles is of highly contagious virus.
*24:00.660- 24:02.820* :  That's enough for it to start spreading again.
*24:03.320- 24:06.900* :  So what are health experts recommending to stop the spread?
*24:07.380- 24:13.960* :  Vaccination for children and adults, whoever has missed out on doses of this very effective vaccine
*24:13.960- 24:18.980* :  called the MMR, they want to catch up campaigns in countries across Europe and
*24:19.020- 24:23.920* :  detecting outbreaks quickly so that they can stamp on it. The only way to solve this issue,
*24:24.120- 24:29.100* :  health experts say it's to get more people vaccinated. It's got to be up to that really high level
*24:29.100- 24:36.820* :  of around 95%, which is the target from the WHO. Is there any resistance to vaccination
*24:36.820- 24:43.400* :  with the MMR vaccine? Because it was very unpopular at the turn of the century, wasn't it?
*24:43.500- 24:50.560* :  Around 25 years ago, there was a study published completely falsely claiming it was linked to
*24:50.560- 24:56.160* :  autism in children. That has been completely debunked that theory. But unfortunately,
*24:56.160- 25:01.400* :  it did hit parents' confidence in the vaccine, so at the time some children missed out.
*25:01.840- 25:07.400* :  Then vaccination rates recovered, but there are lots of reasons why people may be missing out.
*25:07.400- 25:11.380* :  The pandemic was one of them. People didn't go and get their vaccinations as normal,
*25:11.380- 25:15.940* :  apart from the ones against COVID and surgeries and health clinics were closed and people didn't
*25:15.940- 25:22.620* :  go to hospitals. But there is some anti-vaccine sentiment around, and also people are just
*25:22.620- 25:26.600* :  sometimes struggling to get through to their local family doctor or struggling to get a
*25:26.600- 25:31.360* :  convenient appointment in their busy lives. And sometimes it's lower down their list of priorities,
*25:31.360- 25:36.000* :  and that's an issue as well. People haven't seen measles, which can be a very deadly disease,
*25:36.180- 25:38.600* :  and so they forget about it, and they forget that it's a threat.
*25:39.720- 25:40.500* :  Philippa Roxby.
*25:41.540- 25:45.460* :  Unions in Argentina have called a general strike on Wednesday. In protest,
*25:45.460- 25:48.660* :  a sweeping set of new laws designed to cut public spending,
*25:48.660- 25:54.240* :  reduce employment protections and pave the way for the privatisation of state industries.
*25:54.240- 25:57.940* :  Those radical measures introduced by the new President Javier Melae
*25:58.280- 26:01.740* :  are aimed at reducing the worst level of inflation in Latin America,
*26:02.060- 26:07.600* :  more than 200% last year. And that has pushed almost half the country into poverty.
*26:07.600- 26:12.140* :  James Menendez in Buenos Aires has been taking a closer look at Javier Melae.
*26:13.800- 26:17.140* :  On a dusty pitch in a working class sub of Buenos Aires,
*26:17.580- 26:21.160* :  a small group of young footballers have been put through their paces.
*26:22.220- 26:27.740* :  They're training for Chacarita Juniors, the team that Javier Melae joined as a young teenager.
*26:27.740- 26:32.800* :  He was the goalkeeper, pretty fearless by all accounts, but also unassuming.
*26:32.800- 26:38.840* :  According to his coach at the time, Eduardo Greco, who 40 years later still runs things around here.
*26:39.080- 26:43.600* :  He was a very dedicated boy, very focused on training.
*26:43.600- 26:49.080* :  He was not used to being in large groups, quite withdrawn and kept a low profile.
*26:51.000- 26:55.560* :  Greco says he was genuinely surprised when it became clear that Melae had a real chance of
*26:55.560- 27:00.980* :  rising to the very top of Argentine politics. He also told me incidentally that the young goal
*27:00.980- 27:06.300* :  he used to have neat blonde hair. And then, in fact, he was brought up in a solidly middle-class
*27:06.560- 27:06.940* :  household.
*27:11.320- 27:17.040* :  Towards the end of his time at school, he formed a Rolling Stones cover band. This was his favorite song.
*27:21.520- 27:26.360* :  Everest, as they were known, were together for six months. They only performed twice in public.
*27:26.860- 27:31.500* :  Melae was Mick Jagger, his friend Hernán Boracchia, was drummer Charlie Watts,
*27:31.500- 27:36.600* :  and on a poor phone line from Spain, he told me that Melae loved the limelight.
*27:37.500- 27:42.480* :  He started out doing a parody of Mick Jagger, but then he ended up actually becoming him.
*27:42.500- 27:47.740* :  He came up with all the elements and put together the show. It was incredible. He was unique.
*27:47.740- 27:53.240* :  He also had a unique style when he started to teach economics as a postgraduate student.
*27:53.260- 27:58.060* :  A pool by the hyperinflation of a previous economic crisis in Argentina,
*27:58.060- 28:04.260* :  he became obsessed with libertarian ideas about shrinking the state and untrammeled free markets.
*28:04.900- 28:07.080* :  Frank Orpino was in one of his classes.
*28:09.300- 28:14.300* :  I was struck by his hairstyle. The time I had him as a professor, I was very glad,
*28:14.720- 28:16.740* :  because he came with very different ideas.
*28:20.120- 28:25.180* :  And it was those radical views and the rock star styling that got him noticed by TV and
*28:25.180- 28:29.200* :  radio producers who began booking him as a pundit for discussion programs.
*28:29.940- 28:34.600* :  Audiences, or at least some of them, laptop his increasingly abrasive style.
*28:34.600- 28:39.760* :  He once called a former mayor of Buenos Aires, a socialist piece of, you can guess what?
*28:39.760- 28:44.500* :  And Pope Francis, who's from Argentina, a donkey and an ignoramus.
*28:45.260- 28:48.780* :  And the more famous he became, the more extreme his behavior.
*28:48.980- 28:51.440* :  Ministerio de Torifo de Porte afuera.
*28:52.080- 28:57.540* :  Just two years after getting elected as an MP, he was thrust onto the presidential campaign trail,
*28:57.540- 29:01.260* :  promising to slash the number of government ministries by half.
*29:01.760- 29:07.440* :  Pledges like this got him noticed, but so did reports of malaise increasingly eccentric behaviour.
*29:08.100- 29:12.340* :  He said that the only two constants in his life are his sister and his dogs.
*29:12.940- 29:18.900* :  Five English mastiffs cloned from his first canine friend, Conan, who died a few years
*29:19.100- 29:25.620* :  ago. Juan Luis González is author of a biography of Javier Milé called El Loco, or The Mad Men.
*29:28.140- 29:33.120* :  I don't know if he is crazy in clinical terms, but has a journalist what I can say is
*29:33.120- 29:36.420* :  that he says he talks to a dog that's been dead for six or seven years.
*29:36.720- 29:40.920* :  He also says that the dead dog communicates with God, and that God was the one who told him that
*29:40.920- 29:46.120* :  he would be president in 2023. And also that his clone dogs are the ones that advise him on
*29:46.120- 29:49.620* :  political decisions. So I think there must be a clinical case there.
*29:49.980- 29:56.820* :  Juan tells me he's a lot like Donald Trump. He is impossible to ignore, and more than half the
*29:56.820- 30:04.540* :  country voted for him, hoping desperately he is the one to turn this country around. That is a
*30:04.540- 30:12.140* :  tall order for anyone. James Menendez reporting from Buenos Aires. Let's take you back to 1940s Hollywood
*30:12.140- 30:16.420* :  now, when the US government began to single out those that accused of being communist sympathizers.
*30:16.720- 30:21.620* :  It became known as the Red Scare. Hundreds of directors, actors, and producers were blacklisted,
*30:21.620- 30:27.920* :  never able to work in the industry again, among them, Orson Wells, Leonard Bernstein, and Charlie
*30:27.920- 30:34.860* :  Chaplin. Well, the first have a ten-part podcast called Hollywood Exiles. That's now on the BBC
*30:34.860- 30:40.360* :  World Service, and it's narrated by Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter, Una. Rob Young asked the producer
*30:40.360- 30:47.040* :  in Tamsley how interested was she in shining a light on this period? She really was. This was in
*30:47.040- 30:51.980* :  the wake of the Second World War. There was this divide in the United States. Charlie Chaplin was
*30:51.980- 30:59.620* :  one of the biggest stars in the world. He was at a level of fame and celebrity that is hard to
*30:59.620- 31:05.340* :  compare to today, really. And so we went to Una who is an actor in her own right. People might know
*31:05.340- 31:11.160* :  her from programmes like Game of Thrones. And she was really interested. She didn't know a huge
*31:11.160- 31:15.860* :  amount about this era. She didn't know about him being forced out of the United States.
*31:16.500- 31:20.400* :  And we realised quite early on when Una was involved that to understand what happened to all of
*31:20.400- 31:27.280* :  these people, you really had to understand who they were and where they had come from. And so we
*31:27.280- 31:32.740* :  started the journey with Una at the beginning of Charlie Chaplin's story in South London in
*31:32.740- 31:39.240* :  Kennington. And we went to a cinema museum in South London. And we have a little clip to play
*31:39.240- 31:44.740* :  you where we basically take her to this museum and she discovers that it has a hidden history that
*31:44.740- 31:51.940* :  she wasn't aware of. This building is imposing and beautiful. And as we'd been approaching, I'd
*31:51.940- 31:59.820* :  wondered what it had been before. What was its history? I was stunned to find out. You may be surprised
*31:59.820- 32:06.220* :  to learn that this building started life as the Lambeth Workhouse. And your grandfather was here
*32:06.220- 32:13.580* :  several times as a child. Working here? Yeah. Wow. His childhood was very poverty-stricken.
*32:14.480- 32:20.740* :  And so Glyn, what sort of an impact did the red scare have on Chaplin then? And how did he deal
*32:20.740- 32:24.740* :  with it? How did he respond? Well it had a huge effect on him. I mean one of the things we find out
*32:24.780- 32:30.260* :  in this first episode, which is available now, is he was actually the very first person in Hollywood
*32:30.260- 32:36.860* :  who was accused of being a communist. It goes back as far as 1922, his FBI file. And that FBI
*32:36.860- 32:42.440* :  file builds up through the 1940s, through the 1950s. He's put on trial for crimes he didn't commit. His
*32:42.440- 32:47.440* :  name is dragged through the mud in the gossip columns. And eventually he is forced to leave United
*32:47.440- 32:53.240* :  States. Una spoke to her mum, Geraldine Chaplin, who's also an actor. And she remembers being on
*32:53.240- 32:59.520* :  the boat with her dad and mum when they left the United States, never to return. She was too young
*32:59.520- 33:05.140* :  to remember that, but years later she did ask her dad about, she found out in school and she
*33:05.140- 33:08.320* :  went home and she asked him about being a communist and we have that clip to play you as well.
*33:08.520- 33:11.880* :  I asked, Daddy, is it true? You can't go back to the States because you're a communist.
*33:11.880- 33:17.920* :  You're not a communist. Look at the way we live. I'm not a communist. We lived in this in
*33:17.920- 33:25.640* :  the warmest house, which is now a museum. Having lived in such empty poverty when he was a child
*33:26.260- 33:31.060* :  really left its mark on him. But that you saw it in a movie and if you defend the underdog,
*33:31.060- 33:36.700* :  you're a communist. He had friends who were communist. He had friends who were whatever. But I think
*33:36.700- 33:41.740* :  that terrible poverty leave its mark and you'll become someone who defends the underdog.
*33:43.040- 33:49.340* :  Una and Geraldine Chaplin talking about Charlie Chaplin in Hollywood Exiles, which is on the BBC
*33:49.340- 33:55.000* :  World Service now. We're now to something a little different, a set of foul-mouthed African
*33:55.000- 34:00.100* :  grey parrots who were segregated from others because they swore too much in front of visitors,
*34:00.820- 34:05.400* :  are being put back with other parrots at a wildlife park here in England. The hope is that their
*34:05.400- 34:11.240* :  language gets less offensive. Steve Nichols is the chief executive who runs the park in Lincolnshire,
*34:11.640- 34:16.940* :  Michelle Hussain asked him just how bad their language was. It is very, very bad. It's a lot
*34:16.940- 34:21.440* :  worse than what I could actually tell you. You can rest assured, I'll not be saying anything. However,
*34:21.440- 34:26.580* :  I am in ear-short off. There's about a dozen around me and I know I can see that two of them
*34:26.820- 34:31.040* :  are the relentless swearing parrots, so I will try my hardest to make sure that I disguise anything
*34:31.040- 34:34.920* :  that they say, but I am very close to them, but I don't think they'll swear while I've got to
*34:34.920- 34:39.460* :  sell it for in my hands. Well, we can all hope. But someone must have taught them, right? They knew
*34:39.460- 34:44.100* :  that they picked this up from. No, no, no, basically. So what happens is a strange thing. African
*34:44.100- 34:49.920* :  grays are, by far, the best at repeating people's words. And when people have them as a tet,
*34:49.920- 34:54.860* :  as a fun thing to do, the majority of people teach them some unusual words. And the good thing about
*34:54.880- 34:58.740* :  this is you can tell exactly what it is that's actually taught them because they replicate the
*34:58.740- 35:02.280* :  voice. They don't want to say the word. So if it's a gentleman that's done it, they've come in a
*35:02.280- 35:06.040* :  gentleman's voice, and it is the actual gentleman's voice that's done it in the bird to the sanctuary,
*35:06.340- 35:10.460* :  or if it's a lady, it's exactly the same as a lady. So what they can't do is they can't come and say,
*35:10.460- 35:13.920* :  my husband's taught him to swear, and then he's swears in the lady's voice because you'll
*35:13.920- 35:19.200* :  guarantee that's all sorted. And once they do teach them, you can't help but laugh. I've been doing
*35:19.200- 35:24.260* :  this 35 years, and when I walk past an Avery and a parrot swears at me, I still laugh now. It's
*35:24.260- 35:29.140* :  impossible not to laugh. And they think that's a positive reaction. So they just do it more. But
*35:29.140- 35:32.980* :  but you had them in a kind of foul-mortmouth corner of the park. Why have you changed your mind?
*35:32.980- 35:39.640* :  With the idea is it because we've had another three that's come now. So we've got eight, and we've
*35:39.640- 35:44.980* :  just finished constructing a new enclosure where we've just moved 92. So we've got quite a large colony
*35:44.980- 35:52.160* :  of African grace, so we've just moved 92 together. So he said, what we'll do is put all 92 with the eight,
*35:52.400- 35:55.860* :  and hopefully all the noises that you can hear in the background now, they're lovely whistles
*35:55.860- 36:00.760* :  on the sounds with the odd microwave thrown in and the odd vehicle reverse in noise. We're hoping
*36:00.760- 36:06.020* :  they're going to teach the eight, that kind of vocabulary, rather than the other way around with
*36:06.020- 36:09.420* :  parrot. How do you know the other way around is not going to happen, although I have to say this
*36:09.420- 36:14.140* :  can't have been bad for visitor numbers. The original foul-mortmouth corner, and now this.
*36:14.540- 36:18.800* :  Totally the truth. It's a phenomenal thing that's happened. We don't know why, but I think it's
*36:18.800- 36:23.200* :  just nice every now and then to have a light hearted story against all the heavy stories that's
*36:23.200- 36:29.240* :  going in the news. And since 2020, every single month we've had a call from somewhere around the
*36:29.240- 36:33.720* :  world without fail, and it's just going around the world all the time constantly, where people
*36:33.720- 36:38.340* :  call and say, how's the birds doing? And they stop swearing. And unfortunately, no, they'll never stop
*36:38.340- 36:43.780* :  swearing. We just want them to swear less. But in all honesty, the actual visitors are coming to
*36:43.780- 36:49.640* :  hear them. We've got signs in front of the avarice, so try to stop them. There you go. We'll see what
*36:49.640- 36:55.240* :  happens. That's Steve Nichols. Speaking to Michelle Hussain about the potty mouthed parrots at Lincolnshire
*36:55.240- 37:03.460* :  Wildlife Park in England. And that is it for us for now, but there will be a new edition
