*00:59.800- 01:05.900* :  And Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 30th of January these are our main stories.
*01:05.900- 01:12.140* :  Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan is given ten years in jail for leaking state secrets.
*01:12.140- 01:17.620* :  Israel says it's killed three Palestinian militants in an undercover operation at a hospital
*01:17.620- 01:24.940* :  in the occupied West Bank. New hope for some refugees hoping to flee Sudan's civil war to safety in Canada.
*01:27.820- 01:33.460* :  Also in this podcast could Lily Gladstone become the first Native American to win an Oscar
*01:33.840- 01:41.200* :  after being nominated for best actress. 96 years of Oscars. I'm grateful. It's about time.
*01:45.760- 01:51.540* :  The Pakistani government says he leaked state secrets. He says it's a joke once again
*01:51.540- 01:57.240* :  Imran Khan Pakistan's former prime minister is making headlines after being sentenced to ten years
*01:57.240- 02:03.200* :  in jail. Imran Khan has been in prison since last August after being convicted on corruption charges
*02:03.640- 02:09.600* :  and the latest case took place behind closed doors in a prison in Rao Pindi. He denies any wrong
*02:09.600- 02:16.340* :  doing and his lawyers say the trial was unconstitutional. His political party the PTI says it will appeal
*02:16.340- 02:21.620* :  against the verdict. I asked our correspondent in Islamabad Caroline Davis about the case.
*02:22.080- 02:26.700* :  So this has been referred to as the cipher case. It relates to his appearance at a rally in March
*02:26.700- 02:32.420* :  of 2022 which was a month before he was ousted from power in a vote of no confidence. Now Mr.
*02:32.420- 02:38.500* :  Khan appeared on stage waving a piece of paper that he said showed a phone conspiracy against him.
*02:38.820- 02:45.620* :  Now he said that detailed that all will be forgiven if Imran Khan is removed from power. He
*02:45.620- 02:51.100* :  didn't during the course directly say which foreign power that he thought this was conspiracy was
*02:51.100- 02:55.760* :  from but in the rest of the speech he was incredibly critical of America so people have drawn a line
*02:55.760- 03:01.120* :  between those two things. Now the prosecution in this case said that Mr. Khan's actions
*03:01.120- 03:07.140* :  amounted to leaking classified documents and had subsequently damaged diplomatic relations
*03:07.300- 03:11.940* :  and it's that second part the damaging of diplomatic relations that really holds a long
*03:11.940- 03:16.900* :  potential sentence. If he was found guilty of that then it could be life imprisonment
*03:17.400- 03:23.480* :  or even the death penalty. Now we do now know that he has been found guilty as has the former
*03:23.500- 03:30.760* :  foreign minister Sharma Khood Kureshi and they have both been given 10 years in prison. Now Mr.
*03:30.760- 03:35.480* :  Khan was already disqualified from being able to run in the upcoming general elections.
*03:35.880- 03:42.440* :  Bear in mind they are less than two weeks away but the big question now will be what is the impact
*03:42.440- 03:47.820* :  that this verdict and this decision has on his supporters. People who are part of his party,
*03:47.820- 03:52.840* :  the PTI are currently running as independent candidates that is as a result of a decision that
*03:52.840- 03:58.280* :  was made by the Electoral Commission here to remove Imran Khan's the party symbol of the
*03:58.280- 04:03.420* :  cricket bat and all of these candidates are now running as independence. Will this mean that
*04:03.420- 04:10.620* :  people decide to come out more fervently in favor of Imran Khan's PTI bat candidates or will it
*04:10.620- 04:16.000* :  mean that there is some form of damage to morale of the party? Those are the things we are now
*04:16.000- 04:21.080* :  really looking out for. Has there been any reaction? Have his supporters come out on this street?
*04:21.760- 04:27.180* :  So far we haven't seen anything out in public. We've seen a statement from his party, the PTI,
*04:27.180- 04:32.200* :  they've called this decision a mockery and from our conversations with individuals in the party
*04:32.200- 04:36.820* :  seems quite clear that they are intending on trying to appeal this decision and this sentencing.
*04:37.300- 04:41.620* :  So that will be something that we will see that they, I'm sure his party as they have done before
*04:42.060- 04:45.740* :  tend to try to pick over any of these decisions and try to find anything that they can then use
*04:46.060- 04:50.700* :  to go to other courts to try to appeal and overturn it. Bear in mind this entire proceedings
*04:50.700- 04:56.760* :  for this particular court case was heard away from the public. It was heard inside the prison
*04:57.380- 05:01.920* :  itself. International media was not allowed to attend although some local media was able to
*05:01.920- 05:06.580* :  attend. And so this is the sort of backdrop to all of this that we haven't seen anything
*05:07.020- 05:10.580* :  yet on the streets but we will be looking to see if there is any form of public reaction after
*05:10.580- 05:18.140* :  this decision. Caroline Davis in Pakistan. The BBC's verify team has confirmed the authenticity
*05:18.140- 05:24.480* :  of a video showing Israeli forces dressed as medics inside a hospital in Janine in the occupied
*05:24.480- 05:31.240* :  West Bank. Three Palestinians they claim were militants were killed. CCTV footage showed members
*05:31.240- 05:36.720* :  of an undercover unit making their way through a corridor with rifles raised. The Israeli
*05:36.720- 05:41.100* :  military said the militants were hiding in the hospital and that one was about to attack.
*05:41.100- 05:46.140* :  The Palestinian authorities' Ministry of Health accused Israel of carrying out what they called
*05:46.140- 05:52.540* :  a new massacre inside hospitals. I spoke to our correspondent Mark Loen in Jerusalem and asked him
*05:52.540- 05:58.360* :  what's known about the hospital raid. Well this is carried out by Israeli commandos Val and
*05:58.440- 06:05.700* :  CCTV from the hospital in Janine in the West Bank show that the Israeli forces were disguised
*06:05.760- 06:12.300* :  some of them as women some of them as doctors as they walked through the corridor of this hospital
*06:12.300- 06:18.940* :  and then found a room where three in their words terrorists were sheltering and they killed
*06:18.940- 06:25.260* :  all three of them with guns fitted with silences. Now one of them has been claimed by Hamas as a member
*06:25.260- 06:30.400* :  and two of them by Hamas's spin-off or organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Israelis say that
*06:30.400- 06:35.240* :  one of them was planning an attack similar to that carried out on the 7th of October against
*06:35.240- 06:39.760* :  Israel while two others had already carried out previous attacks against Israeli forces.
*06:40.000- 06:46.900* :  This is a real concern that the spiring violence in the West Bank it is the worst level of violence
*06:46.900- 06:51.200* :  in the occupied West Bank that there has been for two decades really since the second Palestinian
*06:51.200- 06:57.420* :  interfered or uprising in 2000 to 2005 and it shows how the Gaza conflict has spilled over into the
*06:57.420- 07:04.400* :  wider region. Well with all this conflict ongoing what about the words on progress towards a cease
*07:04.460- 07:09.320* :  fire because there's much talk of that despite the violence. There is I mean there were these
*07:09.320- 07:14.860* :  talks held in Paris on Sunday involving the Qataris and the Egyptians in the Americans with the
*07:14.860- 07:20.080* :  idea of a ceasefire deal being proposed in which a truce would be achieved for about 45 days there
*07:20.080- 07:25.100* :  would be a release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and while the Qataris and the
*07:25.100- 07:30.700* :  Americans have talked up the progress on those talks and on the deal it is being dampened down a
*07:30.700- 07:35.400* :  little bit here by the Israelis and by Hamas. There are still big sticking points Hamas has demanded
*07:35.400- 07:40.060* :  a permanent ceasefire as part of a hostage release deal and you know whereas Israel's Prime Minister
*07:40.060- 07:46.240* :  is kind of caught between members of the far right government in his cabinet who don't want him to
*07:46.660- 07:51.680* :  halt to try to destroy Hamas and the hostage families who say that he needs to do more to get
*07:51.680- 07:57.400* :  them back. So I think we're still quite far away from an imminent breakthrough in those ceasefire
*07:57.400- 08:02.440* :  talks but clearly some progress is being made. And meanwhile there's the pireless conditions faced
*08:02.440- 08:08.700* :  by civilians in Gaza and we have the UN Secretary-General Antone Guterres meeting donors who suspended
*08:08.700- 08:13.720* :  aid to the UN Relief Agency and right today. What is going to be achieved by that?
*08:13.920- 08:18.160* :  Well Antone Guterres she's going to try to convince western governments who have suspended
*08:18.160- 08:24.560* :  aid to the UN Palestinian refugee agency to reverse their decision because it is an agency that is
*08:24.560- 08:29.760* :  responsible for providing shelter for distributing aid in Gaza it is playing a vital role and they
*08:29.760- 08:35.200* :  have warned that if the aid dries out if the money for donations dry up by the you know by the
*08:35.200- 08:39.060* :  end of February they will have to stop paying the salaries of their employees and really there is
*08:39.060- 08:43.860* :  no other international body at the moment that could fill the vacuum if Anwar the UN agency stops
*08:43.860- 08:48.580* :  working there so it is a real crisis at the moment for that agency and they're going to see if
*08:48.640- 08:52.800* :  the investigation about their employees who are allegedly involved in the seventh of October
*08:52.800- 08:57.460* :  attack can can get underway quickly and and and convince donors to reverse their decision.
*08:57.940- 09:03.660* :  Mark Lewin speaking to me from Jerusalem and the team at the global story have been diving deeper
*09:03.660- 09:08.640* :  into Tehran's strategy for the Middle East and the potential outcomes for the region.
*09:09.120- 09:14.700* :  Listen to Katya Adler in conversation with Least You Set and experts from BBC Persian that's
*09:14.700- 09:21.320* :  over on BBC sounds just search the global story. After almost two years of conflict in Ukraine
*09:21.320- 09:27.200* :  small groups of Russian troops have now reached the heavily damaged eastern Ukrainian town of
*09:27.200- 09:33.140* :  Avdivka hundreds of civilians who remain there and are trying to leave under relentless bombardment
*09:33.580- 09:39.420* :  but in some parts of the town evacuation is no longer possible. The BBC's Abdul-Jalil Abdullah Selov
*09:39.420- 09:47.460* :  sent us this report from the area. Two officers from the special police unit,
*09:47.860- 09:51.240* :  white angels have arrived to evacuate a wounded woman.
*09:55.580- 10:00.620* :  She lies on the floor of the house. She was outside when a guided bomb exploded nearby
*10:00.920- 10:09.820* :  and shrapnel hit her. The officers are trying to stop the bleeding but there is another problem.
*10:12.380- 10:19.280* :  A Russian drone is watching them. It drops an improvised explosive aimed at their car but it misses.
*10:21.020- 10:27.680* :  Four people carry the woman to an armoured police vehicle on a blanket.
*10:30.700- 10:36.140* :  Since last October, Russia has been relentlessly attacking Avdivka with artillery and planes.
*10:37.020- 10:39.500* :  The Nadyyudin is from the white angels' unit.
*10:39.580- 10:51.380* :  Every day, enemy jets fly in and drop bombs. Last week, they dropped 46 bombs on the town in one day.
*10:52.080- 10:57.520* :  Buildings collapse like a house of cards even basements where people live cannot protect them.
*10:57.580- 11:03.860* :  Residents in other sources who leave or regularly visit Avdivka have told the BBC that recently
*11:03.860- 11:08.220* :  Russian soldiers see several streets in the southern part of the town.
*11:08.560- 11:12.040* :  Vitaly Barabash is the head of Avdivka's military administration.
*11:17.100- 11:22.100* :  Those were small Russian sabotage groups, not large units. They had some certain success
*11:22.580- 11:27.080* :  but the streets that everyone is talking about. So Borna Street is under Ukraine's control.
*11:27.080- 11:32.740* :  We are pushing them out. In pre-war times, Avdivka's population was more than 30,000.
*11:33.280- 11:37.440* :  Today, about 1,000 remain, many of them refuse to leave.
*11:40.560- 11:46.200* :  The Nadyyudin argues that those people are mostly worried about the uncertainty that awaits them in their leave.
*11:49.020- 11:53.680* :  Every day, he and his partners try to convince those residents to evacuate.
*11:56.100- 11:58.340* :  This is one such conversation they recorded.
*11:58.760- 11:58.940* :  Hello.
*12:02.140- 12:06.440* :  Let's go, Granny. Gennady says addressing an elderly lady.
*12:10.020- 12:12.900* :  We buried your neighbor. Another one is now in the hospital.
*12:13.600- 12:18.400* :  We need to evacuate you, the woman waddls and slowly sits on a bed.
*12:21.400- 12:23.700* :  Please, let me die here, she replies.
*12:27.500- 12:31.860* :  This is Victor. He decided to leave because his wife is seriously ill.
*12:32.600- 12:36.320* :  He's part of a group of six that has just been evacuated from Avdivka.
*12:36.760- 12:41.200* :  After an hour drive, they've stopped for a quick break and agreed to speak to the BBC.
*12:45.540- 12:51.520* :  My husband was killed when he went to get some bread. I've left alone. I can't even walk.
*12:52.260- 12:56.100* :  I was so scared of explosions. My leg got paralyzed.
*12:58.640- 13:00.660* :  Okay, let's go, the driver announces.
*13:03.020- 13:05.260* :  Then gone, it's quiet here, he adds.
*13:06.080- 13:10.580* :  And for the first time, a hint of a smile appeared on the faces of his passengers
*13:11.300- 13:13.820* :  as they drive away from the horrors of the war.
*13:14.580- 13:17.480* :  Abdul-Jalil Abdullah Salov in eastern Ukraine.
*13:18.260- 13:20.800* :  Now, Oliver Conway has a quick request.
*13:21.420- 13:25.180* :  Thanks, Val, yes. With the second anniversary of Russia's full invasion
*13:25.180- 13:30.140* :  fast approaching on the 24th of February, we are going to join forces with our friends at Ukraine
*13:30.140- 13:34.820* :  cast to answer any questions you may have about where the war goes from here.
*13:35.440- 13:37.560* :  Can Ukraine take back any more land?
*13:37.560- 13:39.680* :  Will Russia push on further?
*13:40.220- 13:43.180* :  And does Vladimir Putin have designs on other parts of Europe?
*13:43.440- 13:46.560* :  So, please email us if there's anything you want to know and if possible,
*13:46.560- 13:49.720* :  record a voice note so we can play it out in the podcast.
*13:49.720- 13:53.800* :  The address, globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk,
*13:54.420- 13:58.080* :  and you can also tweet us on x at Global NewsPod.
*13:58.700- 13:59.160* :  Thanks, Oli.
*14:00.220- 14:03.920* :  The tech billionaire Elon Musk is known for his car and space technology,
*14:03.920- 14:08.200* :  but now he has moved into a whole new business this time developing humans.
*14:08.300- 14:12.620* :  His company, Neuralink, has successfully implanted its first wireless chip
*14:12.960- 14:13.960* :  into a human patient.
*14:14.000- 14:17.560* :  It's hoped the operation will eventually help disabled people to move
*14:17.940- 14:19.260* :  and blind people to see.
*14:19.780- 14:22.420* :  Although this isn't the first time this technology has been used,
*14:22.420- 14:26.300* :  this latest medical procedure is being seen as a significant step
*14:26.300- 14:32.100* :  with Elon Musk hoping to one day merge artificial intelligence with the human mind.
*14:32.620- 14:34.680* :  RLA correspondent is Peter Boes.
*14:35.160- 14:39.360* :  What Elon Musk's Neuralink is trying to do is what a number of other companies
*14:39.780- 14:43.560* :  have been attempting for quite a while now and that is essentially to create
*14:43.560- 14:49.220* :  a brain computer interface that will allow a human being to
*14:49.660- 14:52.780* :  carry out an action through thought alone.
*14:52.780- 14:57.780* :  Now it involves implanting a number of microchips into the brain
*14:57.780- 15:01.420* :  that connect to a part of the brain that is responsible for movement
*15:02.560- 15:02.580* :  intention.
*15:02.700- 15:07.260* :  It has the effect that wirelessly it can send a signal to an app
*15:07.320- 15:11.000* :  that can interpret a person's intentions.
*15:11.120- 15:14.760* :  It sounds very futuristic but according to Elon Musk,
*15:14.860- 15:18.800* :  he says in a post on X he elaborates a little bit saying that
*15:18.980- 15:22.220* :  this device will enable control of your phone or computer
*15:22.740- 15:26.660* :  and through them almost any device just by thinking.
*15:26.660- 15:30.840* :  He says initial users will be those who have lost use of their limbs.
*15:30.840- 15:36.200* :  It seems they're targeting people with debilitating neurological conditions.
*15:36.420- 15:40.200* :  Now it should be stressed that this study is in the early stages.
*15:40.380- 15:45.800* :  His company was given the go-ahead only last year by US regulators to
*15:45.800- 15:51.560* :  carry out this human trial which is in the safety assessment stages.
*15:51.960- 15:55.860* :  And clearly there is a lot to assess over the following months and
*15:55.860- 16:00.540* :  years question mark over whether this device will still be operating as it is
*16:00.540- 16:05.780* :  designed after three months six months possibly a few years and the results
*16:05.780- 16:10.520* :  will be scrutinised very closely so with that in mind realistically and
*16:10.520- 16:15.320* :  practically it could be several years if indeed it is shown to be successful
*16:15.720- 16:18.860* :  before this kind of thing is available on a wide scale.
*16:19.400- 16:23.860* :  Peter Bowes, well if that all sounded complicated it's because it is but
*16:23.860- 16:25.880* :  crucially is this safe.
*16:26.440- 16:30.300* :  Well Neuralink is under federal investigation for potential animal welfare
*16:30.300- 16:35.280* :  violations during previous tests of this tech due to internal staff complaints.
*16:35.360- 16:38.900* :  For more analysis we heard from senior reporter at the independent
*16:38.900- 16:42.780* :  IO Dodd who's in San Francisco's Silicon Valley.
*16:43.280- 16:47.400* :  Elon Musk and Neuralink have not really said very much about the specifics of the test.
*16:47.400- 16:51.080* :  I mean that there's been a successful implementation which is good news
*16:51.520- 16:55.140* :  especially considering the checkered history of animal rights that this company has in
*16:55.140- 16:56.780* :  its previous non-human tests.
*16:57.220- 17:02.200* :  And so what Neuralink is doing and where it is in the constellation of all these previous
*17:02.200- 17:06.420* :  research efforts. Neuralink is generally saying it isn't actually very far.
*17:06.800- 17:11.060* :  It's not really doing anything new in neuroscience terms and there's a lot of sort of ideas
*17:11.060- 17:14.860* :  big science fiction visions that Elon Musk has to the future of this technology
*17:14.860- 17:17.640* :  that have a lot of barriers between here and there.
*17:18.280- 17:23.660* :  Journalist IO Dodd still to come in this podcast.
*17:24.700- 17:30.500* :  The minute I got saw him in the courtroom it turns out he's nothing
*17:31.020- 17:33.820* :  the fear lifted and just went away.
*17:34.080- 17:36.880* :  It just was gone because he's nothing.
*17:38.180- 17:43.300* :  What next for E. Jean Carroll after her victory over Donald Trump in court?
*17:55.840- 18:00.660* :  I'm Katya Adler and today on the global story we look at spreading violence and tensions
*18:00.660- 18:06.420* :  in the Middle East and ask what Iran's strategy is Iran manipulating the situation to its
*18:06.420- 18:10.740* :  advantage or is it on the defensive fearing an existential threat.
*18:10.740- 18:15.320* :  The global story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC Journalists
*18:15.320- 18:18.720* :  around the world. Find us wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*18:31.720- 18:37.220* :  A second weekend of protests have taken place in Germany after allegations that far-right activists
*18:37.220- 18:43.040* :  discuss the mass deportation of migrants and German citizens of foreign origin at a political
*18:43.040- 18:48.660* :  meeting. The scandal has damaged the far-right alternative for Deutsche Party which had been
*18:48.660- 18:53.400* :  pulling strongly in Germany as the country deals with the rising cost of living and a slowing
*18:53.400- 18:59.100* :  economy. The BBC's Jessica Parker has been two chemists in the state of Saxony.
*19:00.660- 19:07.520* :  A crowd gathers in Chemnitz city square with help Renata Harris slowly climbs stairs to the stage
*19:07.520- 19:14.520* :  for her speech. In her 80s she survived the Holocaust. Many of her Jewish family did not.
*19:16.620- 19:22.860* :  It's very important that we Jews raise our voice. The situation in Germany has become threatening
*19:22.860- 19:28.860* :  because of alternative for Deutschland and other far-right groups. These demos were sparked by a
*19:28.860- 19:34.320* :  report from the investigative outlet Corrective. It revealed that senior figures from the alternative
*19:34.320- 19:40.340* :  for Deutschland Party met with right-wing extremists where the mass deportation of asylum
*19:40.340- 19:47.100* :  seekers and so-called non-Germans was allegedly discussed. The next day the same squares now
*19:47.100- 19:57.120* :  home to a market. Yarnas selling plenty of honey but says life isn't good. She's unhappy about
*19:57.120- 20:04.040* :  the cost of living and cash being sent to Ukraine. The AFD has been pulling at over 30% here in
*20:04.040- 20:11.720* :  Saxony and she's planning to vote for them. They never had a chance to be in power because no one
*20:11.720- 20:17.940* :  wants to work with them. Maybe if they got into power it would be good for us. The AFD says it's
*20:17.940- 20:24.840* :  being smeared but the party in Saxony has been designated as extremist by domestic intelligence.
*20:24.960- 20:30.280* :  I meet Falker Dringenberg, the party's group leader here. What do you think about the fact there
*20:30.280- 20:38.220* :  are hundreds of thousands of people protesting against your party? We're aware of it but we believe
*20:38.220- 20:43.860* :  that many of these demonstrators don't know our program. We're in the absurd situation where people
*20:43.860- 20:49.720* :  demonstrate with the government against the opposition that's unheard of. We're in that part of
*20:49.720- 20:55.700* :  Germany that was separated off from the West for decades and still some people carry a sense of
*20:55.700- 21:01.980* :  being different somehow. It's seen as a driver of the AFD's popularity here. The level of support
*21:01.980- 21:08.260* :  will be tested in key elections later this year. In Germany I'm the BBC's Jessica Parker for Marketplace.
*21:09.200- 21:13.860* :  Sudan's ongoing civil war between two factions within the military government has displaced
*21:13.860- 21:19.040* :  millions of people while many have fled to neighbouring countries, some are now looking even
*21:19.040- 21:25.220* :  further afield to Canada. The Canadian government recently announced a humanitarian pathway for
*21:25.220- 21:31.180* :  Sudanese who have immediate family in the country. It's one of the few nations to offer family
*21:31.180- 21:38.020* :  reunification for Sudanese refugees but how viable is the plan? The BBC's Priacipi reports.
*21:40.720- 21:48.240* :  Saeedah Hassan, a 58-year-old woman from Sudan, recently made a 200-mile journey through Central
*21:48.240- 21:54.880* :  Sudan from the city of Onderman to Atbara. She was travelling with her mother and brother.
*21:57.200- 22:03.520* :  The journey was truly exhausting and very difficult but they were determined to reach Atbara.
*22:04.100- 22:08.780* :  It's one of the only few places in Sudan where passports are still issued.
*22:09.500- 22:16.360* :  Last month the Canadian government announced it would give permanent residency for up to 3,250
*22:16.380- 22:22.700* :  Sudanese nationals who have immediate family in Canada. Speaking on the phone from Sudan,
*22:23.540- 22:32.240* :  Saeedah told me this is a lifeline. It's such a wonderful feeling to have this opportunity to
*22:32.240- 22:39.060* :  migrate to Canada because we went through so many hardships. Sudanese Canadians hoping to sponsor
*22:39.060- 22:50.620* :  a close relative must earn a minimum of $27,514 or have $9,900 in savings. Ranya Elfil,
*22:50.960- 22:56.780* :  a Canadian citizen who helps to run an association representing Sudanese Canadian communities,
*22:57.680- 23:02.120* :  says this will be a challenge for many. Since the war in Sudan started in April,
*23:02.420- 23:07.560* :  a lot of people here have been supporting their families and that basically depleted and affected
*23:07.560- 23:12.460* :  their savings and that's why it's been very difficult for them to meet the current financial
*23:12.460- 23:18.900* :  requirements. Canada also requires a biometric and security screening and medical checkup
*23:18.900- 23:24.940* :  to enter the country. In all of Sudan there is one remaining authorized medical center where people
*23:24.940- 23:30.300* :  can do the medical check. There is no center at this point in Sudan where people can do biometrics.
*23:30.660- 23:37.660* :  Aya, a 34-year-old Sudanese Canadian citizen, has been living in Ontario for the past 23 years.
*23:37.660- 23:42.200* :  I'm sitting here and for the past eight months I've been trying to raise funds for
*23:42.200- 23:48.140* :  my two aunts and uncles who are elderly and their children and grandchildren because they've
*23:48.140- 23:54.000* :  been displaced for a third, fourth and fifth time so far. Most of us are spending all of our personal
*23:54.000- 23:59.900* :  finances with taking on multiple jobs just to be able to do the humanitarian work that Canada
*23:59.900- 24:06.600* :  should be at the very forefront in. The Canadian government told the BBC that the financial
*24:06.600- 24:12.500* :  requirements of the program are muddled on the same minimum income requirement used for other
*24:12.500- 24:21.460* :  family reunification programs. 6,000 miles away from Ontario, Saida passes the time by walking
*24:21.460- 24:26.320* :  around the small quiet neighbourhood where she is staying in Atbara. She is hoping
*24:26.320- 24:31.840* :  her mother and brother's passports will be ready soon. Then the family can submit their documents
*24:31.840- 24:38.540* :  when the process to go to Canada opens in February. She tells me she can't wait for this to happen.
*24:40.540- 24:46.540* :  When we will finally reunite with our siblings it will be an amazing feeling,
*24:46.540- 24:53.660* :  it will be such a joyous moment. That report from Priya Sipi. Last week,
*24:53.660- 24:59.300* :  Eugene Carroll was awarded more than $80 million after suing former President Donald Trump
*24:59.300- 25:04.880* :  for defamation because he denied claims of rape in a New York department store 30 years ago.
*25:04.880- 25:09.820* :  She's had the weekend to think about the money possibly coming her way and on Monday some
*25:09.820- 25:13.780* :  clues emerged about what she might do with it as Ellen Bicknell reports.
*25:14.780- 25:19.960* :  In her first interview since winning that incredible sum, Miss Carroll told ABC News that the
*25:19.960- 25:27.180* :  elation she felt in court on Friday was almost painful. $83.3 million, a mixture of emotional
*25:27.180- 25:32.520* :  and punitive damages is more than eight times what she initially sought. Speaking on the
*25:32.520- 25:37.060* :  news program Good Morning America, she hinted that some of it will go towards something Donald
*25:37.060- 25:42.600* :  Trump hates, such as a fund for women who also accused the former President of sexual assault.
*25:43.180- 25:50.380* :  Oddly enough, the minute I got saw him in the courtroom, it turns out he's nothing.
*25:50.380- 25:56.780* :  The fear lifted and just went away. It just was gone because he's nothing.
*25:57.680- 26:01.900* :  Now this is the second time Mr. Trump has been ordered to pay Miss Carroll damages.
*26:02.420- 26:06.400* :  Last year he deposited $5 million for a separate defamation case.
*26:06.960- 26:11.780* :  He denies any wrongdoing and his lawyer has already confirmed that they will look to appeal.
*26:12.440- 26:16.620* :  We will set aside that ridiculous jury and I just want to remind you all of one thing.
*26:16.880- 26:20.500* :  I will continue with President Trump to fight for everybody's first amendment right to speak.
*26:20.680- 26:26.840* :  Everybody's a right to defend themselves when they are wrongfully accused and to be able to say
*26:26.840- 26:33.300* :  I didn't do it. Donald Trump has also taken to a social media platform at truth social to call
*26:33.300- 26:38.540* :  the ruling absolutely ridiculous and he's repeated claims that there's a witch hunt against him
*26:38.540- 26:40.280* :  and his presidential campaign.
*26:40.560- 26:41.260* :  Ella Bicknell.
*26:41.620- 26:46.020* :  According to the United Nations, 2.3 billion people live under difficult conditions
*26:46.020- 26:50.080* :  where it's a problem accessing water and demand is greater than supply.
*26:50.700- 26:53.780* :  That demand is going up while it's used like climate change,
*26:53.780- 26:55.760* :  leading to ever greater shortages.
*26:56.480- 26:58.840* :  Now one company thinks it's find a solution.
*26:58.840- 27:04.620* :  The solution is called water cube and it's makers claim it can create water from air.
*27:05.080- 27:09.320* :  Dr. David Stuckenberg is an entrepreneur who's the co-founder of Genesis Systems,
*27:09.320- 27:13.640* :  the company which makes the tech and he spoke to Victoria Owenkunda.
*27:14.260- 27:18.000* :  The idea is simple that we have a lot of water in the atmosphere.
*27:18.000- 27:22.020* :  In fact, it's equal to 85 times all of Earth's lakes, rivers and streams.
*27:22.820- 27:27.840* :  So the idea is that we want to create moisture or water where and when we want it.
*27:28.260- 27:34.260* :  What we are able to do is create that effect inside of a box and produce water
*27:34.260- 27:39.800* :  that is potable, wear and win and in the quantity for the first time ever that we want.
*27:40.040- 27:46.440* :  It's a little larger than an air conditioner system that would sit outside of your home or flat.
*27:46.460- 27:54.200* :  It's approximately 1 meter cubed and that size will make close to 400 liters of water a day.
*27:54.580- 28:01.240* :  So almost the entire water needs of a household for four people in that box every day.
*28:01.580- 28:06.740* :  And it's a highly efficient process so it's exciting to be able to do that in a home appliance
*28:06.740- 28:09.640* :  for an entire home's water system that's never been done before.
*28:10.500- 28:14.660* :  So how does it work then if I were to purchase these boxed wedges,
*28:15.080- 28:19.660* :  plug it in somewhere in a socket outside and then just watch magic happen?
*28:20.400- 28:26.080* :  It really depends on the use and you can connect it directly to the home's plumbing system
*28:26.840- 28:31.400* :  or you can have it as a standalone unit just providing water into a tank.
*28:32.180- 28:37.040* :  And our goal as a company was to sustainably solve global water scarcity and we didn't want to
*28:37.040- 28:41.640* :  create second and third order effects that were undesirable in doing this.
*28:41.740- 28:47.520* :  And so when we look at taking water from air when we take that water it's replenished
*28:47.860- 28:52.440* :  and anywhere from about nine minutes to nine days the sun keeps that in equilibrium.
*28:53.340- 28:57.880* :  But what we can do is certainly create water in those areas obviously where there's scarcity
*28:57.880- 29:03.820* :  of groundwater supply that's beginning to run out all over the world and the challenge to humanity
*29:03.820- 29:12.560* :  is a great one. The UN estimates that by 2050 almost 80% of the global population will be an
*29:12.560- 29:18.060* :  absolute water scarcity. So the water cube allows us to make water wear in when we want it
*29:18.320- 29:27.440* :  and a price point that is affordable. So $24,000 there about and it's not just quite for the regular
*29:27.440- 29:35.780* :  fork yet, is it David? So actually know a little bit lower about 19,000 U.S. So the cost we expect
*29:35.780- 29:42.360* :  to fall as the product is in the market a little bit longer and as we move more systems out into
*29:42.360- 29:48.920* :  marketplace. So what does the water taste like? Good question and it virtually tastes free.
*29:48.920- 29:53.880* :  It's very very pure water so you can monitor how your water tube is producing water
*29:53.880- 30:00.580* :  and the quality of that water from your smart device. Dr. David Stuckenberg. The UK is world
*30:00.580- 30:05.900* :  famous for its music industry but a new report from lawmakers in Britain has warned the sector
*30:05.900- 30:11.720* :  is a boys club where sexual harassment and abuse is common and that female artists don't report
*30:11.720- 30:16.980* :  behaviour for fear of never working again. Here's our culture correspondent Noon Angie.
*30:17.380- 30:22.900* :  The Women and Equality's Committee said musicians have to sit alongside sexual abusers at parties
*30:22.900- 30:29.060* :  and award ceremonies because of what it called a culture of silence. It also found women face a
*30:29.060- 30:34.760* :  lack of support and persistent unequal pay and the problem is intensified for women of colour
*30:34.760- 30:40.240* :  who already face racial discrimination. It's calling for urgent action to tackle the issue
*30:40.240- 30:45.660* :  of misogyny which it says is endemic in the industry. It makes a series of recommendations
*30:45.660- 30:50.760* :  including better protections for freelance workers and prohibiting the use of non-disclosure
*30:50.760- 30:56.600* :  agreements in sexual abuse cases but it also says a shift in the behaviour of men is what's
*30:56.600- 31:02.280* :  really needed. The British government says the industry must do all it can to address imbalances
*31:02.280- 31:07.240* :  of power and finally to Hollywood where the Oscars race is on for the ceremony in March.
*31:07.240- 31:12.660* :  For the first time a Native American woman could make history by winning a golden statue
*31:12.660- 31:18.920* :  act as Lily Gladstone has been nominated as best actress. Our culture editor Katie Razzle has been
*31:18.920- 31:26.380* :  speaking to her. Killers of the Flower Moon tells the true story of the systematic murder over years
*31:26.380- 31:34.420* :  of dozens of members of the Osage tribe. It's lead Lily Gladstone has already won a golden
*31:34.540- 31:40.900* :  globe and is the first Native American ever nominated for a best actress Oscar. 96 years of
*31:40.900- 31:47.200* :  Oscars I'm grateful it's about time when I accepted the golden globe that's the other thing that
*31:47.200- 31:52.460* :  came to mind immediately is it's circumstantial that I was the first one to win that in the category
*31:53.360- 31:59.740* :  but it doesn't belong to me I'm standing on so many shoulders. More than a century ago
*31:59.740- 32:05.960* :  the Osage got rich after oil was struck on their land. Lily's father recounted that history of
*32:05.960- 32:11.300* :  vast wealth as she was growing up on a black feet reservation. I do remember him telling me about
*32:11.300- 32:16.440* :  Osage is running out of gas and going and buying another rolls Royce and Lino's buying a new car
*32:16.440- 32:22.220* :  we're still warrior but those riches brought a reign of terror. Lily plays Molly Birkhard,
*32:22.620- 32:27.300* :  a real Osage whose mother and three sisters were murdered. He's not a good chick
*32:28.160- 32:33.540* :  she's always. Her husband Ernest played by Leonardo DiCaprio colluded with his powerful uncle
*32:33.540- 32:39.640* :  here Robert De Niro to funnel the family's oil riches their way. The odd person was convicted
*32:39.680- 32:43.700* :  but so many people got away with it. Oh yeah yeah and even the ones who were convicted
*32:43.700- 32:48.920* :  weren't in for that long. It's supposed to be a suicide you jump out. Martin Scorsese originally had
*32:48.920- 32:54.100* :  an FBI investigator as the main character but they realised his epic must come from the Osage
*32:54.100- 33:01.460* :  perspective. Every aspect of the whole script changed because of Osage contribution to it and
*33:01.460- 33:06.060* :  was made the better for it. You know I've never seen a film like this before and Marty's said recently
*33:06.060- 33:10.880* :  several times he feels like this is the most important film he's ever made. And a film that could
*33:10.880- 33:15.920* :  make history. If Lily Gladstone who was voted most likely to win an Oscar while at high school
*33:16.200- 33:22.640* :  triumphs in March and that was Katie Razzle speaking there to Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone.
