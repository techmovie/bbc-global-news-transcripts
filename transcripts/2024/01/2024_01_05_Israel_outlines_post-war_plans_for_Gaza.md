*01:49.340- 01:55.860* :  I'm Nigel Adely and at 1,400 GMT on Friday the 5th of January. These are our main stories.
*01:56.620- 02:01.900* :  Israel proposes a post-war plan for Gaza. As UN aid agencies say, their efforts to
*02:01.900- 02:08.000* :  deliberate in the region are being hindered by security risks and checkpoint delays. North and South
*02:08.000- 02:14.240* :  Korea have conducted live fire drills near their maritime border in the latest escalation of tensions.
*02:17.600- 02:23.080* :  Also in his podcast, the release of Oscar Pistorius on parole 11 years after killing his
*02:23.080- 02:31.000* :  girlfriend, divide opinion in South Africa. And the fact is democracy needs journalism and today
*02:31.000- 02:37.260* :  journalism needs investment. And that's what we're here to provide. A UAE back bid for one of
*02:37.260- 02:47.720* :  Britain's most influential newspapers causes controversy. The United Nations has responded to
*02:47.720- 02:53.720* :  criticism from Israel that it's not delivering aid quickly enough to Gaza, despite Israel opening
*02:53.720- 02:59.940* :  new crossings into the territory. In a statement, the UN's Office for Humanitarian Affairs said
*02:59.940- 03:06.460* :  agencies continued to do all they could in the face of multiple challenges, including denial of
*03:06.460- 03:14.100* :  access and constant bombardment. Imogen folks reports from Geneva. Earlier this week, Israel said the
*03:14.100- 03:20.800* :  UN was stalling over aid deliveries to Gaza, suggesting Israel was playing its part, but UN aid
*03:20.800- 03:27.620* :  agencies were not. Now the UN has responded, saying its teams are hampered by long inspections,
*03:27.620- 03:34.520* :  multiple checkpoints, and constant bombardment, with aid workers being shot at and even killed.
*03:35.280- 03:41.760* :  Last night, the UN reported it had been unable to deliver vital food and medicines to northern Gaza
*03:41.760- 03:48.420* :  for four days, because it had been denied access and because of active conflict. The UN
*03:48.420- 03:56.360* :  statement reflects growing aid agency frustration at what many see as a perhaps willful misinterpretation
*03:56.360- 04:02.180* :  by Israel of the risks and logistics of delivering aid inside a conflict zone.
*04:02.840- 04:08.000* :  Meanwhile, the Israeli Defence Minister Yohav Galant has unveiled his vision for the future
*04:08.000- 04:13.920* :  of post-war Gaza. Crucially, he emphasized that while Palestinians would have administrative
*04:13.920- 04:20.680* :  authority, Israel would maintain overarching security control. The ministers brought out line
*04:20.680- 04:26.500* :  was unveiled as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken embarks on his fourth trip to the region
*04:26.500- 04:32.220* :  since the Hamas attack in October triggered the war. Our correspondent, Shai Makalil,
*04:32.220- 04:37.880* :  is in the occupied West Bank. She says the Israeli plan leaves many questions unanswered,
*04:38.240- 04:42.860* :  particularly what the future holds for those people of Gaza displaced by the war.
*04:43.740- 04:48.000* :  Well, first of all, there isn't much to mention of the people, and I think that in itself would be
*04:48.000- 04:54.340* :  problematic for any of the negotiators, especially the two key Arab negotiators Egypt and Qatar.
*04:54.880- 04:59.680* :  But secondly, I think one of the biggest problematic points was the mention of Israel being
*04:59.680- 05:05.480* :  responsible for the security in Gaza for some time. I think that's going to make any diplomacy
*05:05.480- 05:10.620* :  a problem. I think the other problem is the fact that it's not very clear which Palestinian
*05:10.620- 05:15.820* :  factions, which Palestinian figures would be in charge of Gaza. We know that the United States,
*05:15.820- 05:20.740* :  for example, wants the Palestinian Authority to take part. That really hasn't gone down well
*05:20.740- 05:26.300* :  in Israel, but also remember that just before the killing of Salah Al-Arauri, there was a statement
*05:26.300- 05:32.380* :  from Hamas where they say that they've told Egypt purportedly that any planning of the future of Gaza
*05:32.660- 05:38.900* :  without Hamas is an illusion. So these suggestions are significant in terms of the problems that
*05:38.900- 05:43.220* :  they're going to present diplomatic efforts and negotiating efforts with the United States,
*05:43.220- 05:48.040* :  but also with Egypt and Qatar, the chief negotiators. And of course, the US's top diplomat,
*05:48.040- 05:54.140* :  Anthony Blinken, is heading into the region later today. Has his job become much more difficult
*05:54.140- 05:58.140* :  as a result of what's happened this week? I think so. I think he has a lot to entangle.
*05:58.580- 06:04.620* :  There is still a very deep concern about any retaliation from Hamas and potentially from
*06:04.620- 06:09.640* :  Hezbollah. The speech by Hassan Nasrallah, I think, laid fears initially that there was going to be
*06:09.640- 06:14.460* :  an all-out confrontation and conflict with Israel. He hasn't said that, but he also said that this
*06:14.460- 06:19.160* :  is not going to go without punishment. But remember also this week we've had inflammatory statements,
*06:19.180- 06:23.000* :  at least that's the way they were described by the US State Department, by
*06:23.000- 06:28.700* :  two Israeli cabinet ministers, the finance minister, Israel Smochrich, and the national security
*06:28.700- 06:33.640* :  minister, Ben Gavir, who were both calling for the Gazans to leave, for people of Gaza to leave.
*06:33.780- 06:38.280* :  And I think Anthony Blinken is going to have to entangle a lot of that. Plus, of course,
*06:38.280- 06:43.420* :  the plan that has been presented by the Israeli government. Remember also Egypt
*06:43.420- 06:49.060* :  in that plan has an unspecified role. And I think that also is going to not go down well with Cairo.
*06:49.060- 06:53.300* :  There have been chief negotiators. I don't think they want to be pulled into anything else
*06:53.340- 06:59.880* :  in terms of administration. And so, again, this plan has presented a lot of questions for diplomatic
*06:59.880- 07:07.520* :  efforts. Shyma Kali, the Korean peninsula is volatile at the best of times. The north and south
*07:07.520- 07:14.100* :  remain technically at war, even though an armistice was signed in 1953. And today, the tension
*07:14.100- 07:20.400* :  was taken up a few more notches. As North Korean forces fired hundreds of artillery shells into the sea
*07:20.800- 07:26.300* :  of two tiny South Korean islands, and Seoul responded with live fire drills on one of them.
*07:26.880- 07:30.240* :  This was the reaction of some residents of the South Korean capital.
*07:31.660- 07:36.580* :  I do think about preparations as the war isn't completely over yet,
*07:36.580- 07:41.320* :  but I think it will be settled well somehow. There may be minor clashes,
*07:41.320- 07:44.100* :  but I believe it will not become a big war.
*07:46.380- 07:51.560* :  I think people certainly have to be informed of the reason why we have to evacuate,
*07:52.300- 07:57.480* :  and how and where to evacuate, too, since we do not generally know where the evacuation
*07:57.480- 08:04.420* :  shelters or bunkers are. Our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatten, has been following the day's events.
*08:05.720- 08:14.200* :  North Korea fired shells. They fired about 200 artillery shells into waters still on the North
*08:14.200- 08:22.120* :  Korean side of a maritime line, but South Korea felt threatened by this. And so they've reacted
*08:22.760- 08:29.780* :  by ordering Marines to carry out live fire artillery drills on one of three quite remote islands
*08:29.820- 08:35.900* :  near that important line where those original shells were fired. South Korea says it's also
*08:35.900- 08:40.800* :  planning to stage some of its own naval drills. Now, the important thing is that it's not bad
*08:40.800- 08:47.860* :  unusual for North Korea to carry out this kind of artillery shell drill on each side of this
*08:47.860- 08:54.880* :  quite sensitive maritime line. It's just that this is taking place quite soon after the two
*08:54.880- 09:01.900* :  Koreas decided to scrap an inter-Korea military agreement that had been in place for five years,
*09:01.900- 09:07.680* :  that had been keeping tensions relatively low. Tensions are rising now. That agreement to keep
*09:07.680- 09:12.480* :  peace has been scrapped. And so that's why both countries are feeling quite tense and
*09:12.480- 09:16.760* :  quite nervous right now. And you've been to one of the islands involved and just how sensitive
*09:16.760- 09:22.100* :  is this area? That's right. So I went to the island where the live fire drills are taking place
*09:22.100- 09:28.520* :  right now, Yongpyeong, back in 2010. That's when North Korea fired shells that actually landed on
*09:28.520- 09:34.220* :  the island, killing four people, including two civilians. So I traveled out to that island to do
*09:34.220- 09:41.200* :  some reporting. I've got to say it was a very ruggedly beautiful, quite remote part of the world,
*09:41.200- 09:48.760* :  but it didn't take us very long at all to find shelters where civilians have to seek refuge when
*09:48.760- 09:54.380* :  there are military tensions when shells are fired. And so that's just a way of life on that
*09:54.380- 09:58.600* :  island. And it's quite normal for residents there to have to think about that because they're so
*09:58.600- 10:04.540* :  close to this very sensitive maritime line. Syria Hatton. As you may have heard in the earlier podcast,
*10:05.240- 10:09.900* :  the South African former Paralympic Champion Oscar Pistorius has been released from prison
*10:09.900- 10:15.560* :  on parole after serving eight and a half years for the murder of his girlfriend, Riva Steenkamp.
*10:16.180- 10:20.840* :  His parole demands that he doesn't speak to the press, so his release was carried out with
*10:20.840- 10:26.340* :  little fanfare, despite the hordes of media surrounding the prison. Riva Steenkamp's
*10:26.340- 10:31.700* :  mother has said she isn't convinced he's rehabilitated, and his release could pose a threat to women.
*10:32.300- 10:37.800* :  Bollewa Adonis is a spokesman for Women for Change, a non-profit organization
*10:37.800- 10:44.040* :  that campaigns against gender-based violence. She said Mr Pistorius' release sent out the wrong
*10:44.040- 10:50.900* :  message. Oscar's release is an indication that we have a serious problem, that there's, I guess,
*10:50.900- 10:56.680* :  a normalization of leniency when it comes to predators, when it comes to anyone who commits any type
*10:56.680- 11:02.920* :  of homicide or gender-based violence. So, has justice been done? Karim Morn is a legal reporter
*11:02.920- 11:09.260* :  in South Africa who covered the trial in 2014 and Pistorius' appeal. In the South African
*11:09.760- 11:15.380* :  legal system and particularly under the correctional services legislation, it made sentence not
*11:15.380- 11:21.160* :  for life, become eligible for parole after they've served half their sentence. And having read
*11:21.160- 11:26.760* :  the prison files and the prison reports that were given by the social worker psychologist,
*11:27.100- 11:34.320* :  unit manager, all the staff at the prison, they were overwhelmingly supportive of him getting parole.
*11:34.460- 11:40.840* :  They describe him as someone who drove a tractor, cleaned up the prison cells, the special care
*11:40.840- 11:46.080* :  unit, acted as a library administrator, offered weightlifting advice to fellow inmates,
*11:46.080- 11:50.220* :  also running a Bible study, having a book club, you know, I've gone through the files,
*11:50.260- 11:55.300* :  there were no disciplinary infractions, there was nothing, just if of someone who was a threat to
*11:55.300- 11:59.820* :  society, which of course is what parole authorities need to examine before they let someone out.
*12:00.400- 12:05.420* :  And I think there's a fundamental difficulty because the public imagination is very much,
*12:05.420- 12:11.940* :  as understandably, June Stan Kump and her husband believe that this was a GBV, a gender-based
*12:11.940- 12:16.940* :  violence case, but that was not the ultimate finding of the Supreme Court of Appeal. But people
*12:17.540- 12:22.300* :  very much perceive this continually as a gender-based crime, but the parole system, the prison
*12:22.300- 12:27.220* :  system, will deal with him on the facts that were found by the court, and this is what the court
*12:27.500- 12:33.900* :  found. The belief is that he still insists he didn't deliberately once tell his victims' parents
*12:33.900- 12:39.680* :  that. Yes, I mean, in the social worker and the psychologist report, you know, the social worker
*12:39.680- 12:44.200* :  actually says that it is quote unquote killing him inside, this idea that he will never get the
*12:44.200- 12:50.820* :  opportunity to apologize to them for killing River Stan Kump. So he has maintained throughout
*12:50.820- 12:55.760* :  that, you know, this was not a deliberate act, that is an explanation which Barry Stan Kump
*12:55.820- 13:02.120* :  did not accept. June Stan Kump does not accept, she made that very clear in the victim offender
*13:02.120- 13:07.360* :  statement that she submitted to the parole authorities, which he said, I fundamentally believe that
*13:07.360- 13:12.440* :  this was an act of gender-based violence, and I fundamentally don't believe his version of events.
*13:13.280- 13:19.760* :  Karim Horn, a legal reporter in South Africa. The United States is sending military logistical
*13:19.760- 13:26.100* :  support to aid areas in Japan that were badly hit by Monday's earthquake. 92 people are now
*13:26.100- 13:31.580* :  known to have been killed by the quake, and more than 200 are still missing. Japan's prime
*13:31.580- 13:37.000* :  minister says rescuers will continue to search for them. The BBC's James Coppnell spoke to
*13:37.000- 13:42.340* :  Mitsubi Yatta from the Japanese Red Cross Society about the hope of finding no still missing
*13:42.840- 13:48.660* :  after the crucial four-day market passed. Yesterday, after the 72 hour mark,
*13:48.660- 13:55.580* :  one woman, 80, something years age, in Inshikawa Prefecture, was immacidied, was rescued, with
*13:55.580- 14:01.420* :  Sri Hago. The biggest challenge for us is the access. Most disastrous areas in not-to-peninsular,
*14:01.420- 14:07.940* :  because of road cracks and landslides, it's quite difficult to reach. The major road to the not-to-peninsular
*14:08.100- 14:14.280* :  was partially damaged, because of the landslide, because it rained since two days ago. So landslide
*14:14.280- 14:21.820* :  also happened, so this prevent us from getting in. And is there a risk of aftershocks or landslides
*14:21.820- 14:29.880* :  right now? Is it a dangerous rescue operation? Yes, as of yesterday's January 4th, 499 aftershocks
*14:29.880- 14:36.680* :  have been confirmed. When aftershocks happen, we have to stop some relief activities or medical
*14:36.680- 14:43.300* :  activities, and because of the aftershocks, the road may collapse again. So these kind of things
*14:43.300- 14:50.700* :  prevent us from continuing the relief activities. Tell us about the people who have survived,
*14:50.700- 14:56.180* :  thankfully, but maybe have lost their homes. What sort of conditions are they in? Because they
*14:56.180- 15:02.940* :  have no home right now. So the situation is now they have to stay at evacuation centers,
*15:03.700- 15:09.960* :  which is no huge or no warm environment. Their knees is now food or water,
*15:09.960- 15:16.680* :  blankets, very basic items, but still it's quite difficult to deliver this item to that area.
*15:16.900- 15:23.820* :  They have to stay at evacuation centers or their own vehicles. And these kind of conditions may
*15:23.820- 15:29.960* :  worsen their health condition. We try to deploy medical teams, but still it is not sufficient.
*15:41.440- 15:45.960* :  So many people talk about it, they can access it when their thoughts get hard like a 2-A-M,
*15:46.160- 15:50.240* :  where they can't really talk to any other friends, people with mental health difficulties.
*15:50.520- 15:52.280* :  Oftentimes their thoughts will keep them up.
*15:58.620- 16:05.400* :  Who would kick off 14 of their best players to defend his racist dignity?
*16:05.900- 16:08.240* :  Unmissible stories from around the globe.
*16:08.240- 16:14.420* :  I get a call from the moral police. They told me the general wants to talk to you.
*16:14.620- 16:20.820* :  They asked us to leave the house immediately because it was going to be pumped.

*16:33.480- 16:37.740* :  The Abu Dhabi-backed investor bidding to buy one of Britain's most influential newspapers
*16:38.420- 16:43.800* :  has promised journalists will be given total editorial freedom by its potential new owners.
*16:44.640- 16:49.380* :  The proposed sale of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph has prompted concern about the papers
*16:49.380- 16:55.880* :  falling under the control of a foreign autocratic state. Jeff Zucker, the former boss of CNN,
*16:55.900- 16:59.100* :  is leading the bid by the investment firm Red Bird.
*16:59.720- 17:05.580* :  He says any apprehension over the UAE-backed bid will be addressed by legally binding agreements
*17:05.580- 17:11.860* :  with the government and also the UK regulator Offcom. He spoke exclusively to the BBC's business
*17:11.860- 17:18.500* :  editor Simon Jack. The reality is, when was the last time someone came along and invested in
*17:18.500- 17:25.020* :  such a serious way in a British newspaper or a British magazine? The fact is democracy
*17:25.020- 17:31.580* :  needs journalism and today journalism needs investment and that's what we're here to provide.
*17:31.580- 17:37.280* :  You say journalism needs democracy. That's the last thing Abu Dhabi provides. Is it not? I mean
*17:37.280- 17:42.200* :  IMI controls other media titles. The National, for example, a daily newspaper in English.
*17:42.220- 17:47.100* :  For example, the Princess of the Story of Princess Latifa, a member of the Dubai ruling family,
*17:47.100- 17:50.960* :  fled Dubai in 2018, was forcibly returned. It was a big story in the Western press.
*17:51.360- 17:55.120* :  The National didn't cover it at all. Are you seriously saying that journalists will be
*17:55.120- 18:00.640* :  free to roam wherever they want, given the ownership? I can guarantee that journalists will be
*18:00.640- 18:05.840* :  free to roam wherever they want. There will be no involvement from IMI. That's underpin
*18:06.380- 18:12.360* :  in our guarantees to the UK government through Offcom that there will be complete and total editorial
*18:13.480- 18:18.060* :  independence. Just unpack those those reassurances. What reassurances can you give? How's that
*18:18.060- 18:24.040* :  going to work? There's three levels of protection that are cast iron. One is a legally binding
*18:24.040- 18:30.620* :  JV agreement that already exists between Redbird and IMI that confirms that IMI is completely passive
*18:30.620- 18:38.900* :  and desperate with no operating role whatsoever. That is a private agreement. We have also undertaken
*18:39.400- 18:47.740* :  a public, a specific separate agreement with the UK government in which IMI has guaranteed
*18:47.740- 18:53.920* :  that they will not be involved in any way in the operation of these titles. And then most
*18:53.920- 19:01.540* :  importantly, we have now committed to an editorial trust board that will ensure that all the terms
*19:01.540- 19:07.800* :  of editorial independence are adhered to. If the owners and 75 percent ownership will be
*19:07.800- 19:12.760* :  with the Abu Dhabi royal family, they can appoint a board, they can dissolve it as well.
*19:13.140- 19:17.080* :  It's a bit like a football team, or soccer team as you would say, that the owners can appoint
*19:17.080- 19:20.540* :  the manager and they can also assack the manager and the management staff at any time.
*19:21.180- 19:27.820* :  No. Simon, in fact, we've committed that the editorial trust board will be will be determined
*19:27.820- 19:36.120* :  solely by Redbird and and we've made that in a legally binding commitment to the UK government.
*19:36.460- 19:41.500* :  If you had diluted the Abu Dhabi royal family investments so it was less than 50 percent,
*19:41.500- 19:45.540* :  then you would have not a controlling interest and people probably were in a lot more comforted.
*19:45.540- 19:50.480* :  And yet that was rejected, we understand. Why was it rejected? And what does that tell us
*19:50.900- 19:56.000* :  about this not being a financial investment, but one, where you're buying influence and power,
*19:56.000- 20:02.240* :  or the royal family buying influence and power? This is an American led investment led by Redbird.
*20:02.620- 20:07.240* :  We are funded by the EU. We are confident that our commitments
*20:09.220- 20:15.660* :  and the incredibly robust, legally underpinned editorial protections that we have submitted to
*20:15.660- 20:19.120* :  outcome will be sufficient to address any concerns.
*20:19.900- 20:27.040* :  Jeff Zucker speaking to the BBC's Simon Jack. New uses of artificial intelligence are coming out
*20:27.040- 20:33.260* :  all the time, but one that few predicted appears to be taking off with young people. AI therapy,
*20:33.260- 20:40.300* :  a user-made psychologist has received millions of messages from predominantly young users.
*20:40.840- 20:47.460* :  The chatbot has been sent 78 million messages from people 80 million of which have been sent since
*20:47.460- 20:53.560* :  November and over the holiday period. Some say it's a positive new way for young people to get
*20:53.560- 21:00.260* :  mental health help, but some human psychologists fear the chatbots aren't qualified or effective.
*21:00.900- 21:03.940* :  The BBC Cyber Correspondent Joe Tiny reports.
*21:05.500- 21:10.280* :  Beyoncé. It's me Mario. Super Mario. I'm not the CEO,
*21:10.280- 21:13.240* :  Twitter, my dog is the CEO. Okay. Elon Musk.
*21:15.780- 21:21.500* :  And Vladimir Putin. You can chat to an AI version of pretty much anyone on character.ai.
*21:21.500- 21:26.060* :  The platform uses artificial intelligence, similar to that of chatGPT,
*21:26.060- 21:32.100* :  to allow users to create chatbots that pretend to be any fictional or real people or characters
*21:32.100- 21:38.260* :  and have text conversations. But there's one character that's way more popular than all those we
*21:38.260- 21:44.280* :  just heard from, a psychologist. 78 million messages have been shared with the bots since it was
*21:44.280- 21:49.980* :  created by a user called Blazeman98 just over a year ago. In the lead up to Christmas and over
*21:49.980- 21:55.280* :  the festive season, 18 million messages were shared with the character, which, according to its
*21:55.280- 22:02.620* :  bio, is someone who helps with life's difficulties. Blazeman98 says he's stunned by how popular it's
*22:02.640- 22:08.580* :  proving. I was having my mid school exams and I was quite stressed and all my friends were quite
*22:08.580- 22:14.240* :  stressed. And I was also at the time looking for something to talk to because I was like, oh,
*22:14.240- 22:20.540* :  all my friends are busy. And so I tried my hand at making something that never intended it for
*22:20.540- 22:25.620* :  for it to become popular. And then I jumped back on it. And then I was getting a lot of messages
*22:25.620- 22:30.780* :  from people saying that they had been really positively affected by it, utilizing it well.
*22:30.780- 22:36.500* :  You know, this was a source of comfort for them. Blazeman98 is actually Sam Zeer, a post-grad
*22:36.500- 22:42.100* :  psychology student in New Zealand. He's been so surprised by the impact his bots having. He's now
*22:42.100- 22:48.020* :  researching why people are turning to AI for therapy, especially young people. Character AI has
*22:48.020- 22:54.040* :  about 3.5 million users a day from around the world chatting to bots in multiple languages
*22:54.640- 22:58.920* :  and the site's dominated by the under 30s. I wouldn't be surprised, obviously, this is not
*22:58.920- 23:04.600* :  validated by research, but I wouldn't be surprised if text is like messaging is the preferred
*23:04.600- 23:10.440* :  and common form of communication, you know, picking up the phone or having a face-to-face conversation
*23:10.440- 23:16.620* :  is more difficult generally. But for some people that might find the AI easier to use, so many people
*23:16.620- 23:22.180* :  talk about it being free and they can access it when their thoughts get hard like at 2am,
*23:22.900- 23:27.260* :  where they can't really talk to any other friends or they can't talk to a real therapist,
*23:27.260- 23:32.020* :  but like people with mental health difficulties, oftentimes their thoughts will keep them up.
*23:32.380- 23:37.500* :  We asked some human therapists to try it out, and they all agreed. It's probably an inevitable
*23:37.500- 23:42.920* :  trend as demand for mental health help grows. But they all questioned how effective bots like
*23:42.920- 23:48.200* :  this are, as they can't pick up on the cues that people can over video calls or in person.
*23:48.880- 23:53.120* :  The San Francisco company says it's pleased that people are finding support through its bots,
*23:53.440- 23:58.440* :  but urges users to seek professional and certified help. The firm also played down the
*23:58.440- 24:03.080* :  popularity of therapy on its platform, pointing out that anime and computer game characters
*24:03.540- 24:09.460* :  are more popular and used to fun and role-playing. But we counted nearly 500 character bots
*24:09.460- 24:14.580* :  based around therapy, some like are you feeling okay, and another claiming to be a licensed,
*24:14.580- 24:19.160* :  clinical professional counsellor have been sent more than 10 million messages each.
*24:19.640- 24:23.280* :  There are other bespoke AI therapy apps out there too that are growing in popularity,
*24:23.280- 24:29.880* :  but it seems that character AI is proving to be an unlikely frontier for this new use of artificial
*24:29.880- 24:35.680* :  intelligence. Joe Tidy. There are fears for the future of Africa's birds of prey,
*24:35.680- 24:42.520* :  as a study warns a potential widespread population collapse. The study's authors say urgent action
*24:42.520- 24:49.800* :  is needed, with nearly 90% of species facing steep declines outside protected areas. They're
*24:49.800- 24:56.460* :  calling for energy and agricultural companies to put biodiversity first. The study's author,
*24:56.460- 25:01.380* :  Dr. Dacia Garda, spoke from Kenya to the BBC's Victoria O'oncunda.
*25:02.200- 25:08.540* :  The declines were largest in the region of West Africa, and that is an area where we know
*25:08.540- 25:16.200* :  the agricultural production has been extremely fast and rapid over the last few decades,
*25:16.980- 25:22.100* :  and also the human population growth there as well. And so, yeah, we did find that
*25:23.260- 25:29.000* :  populations of raptors both inside and outside of protected areas, our parks and reserves,
*25:30.220- 25:37.040* :  did fall the greatest in West Africa, but they've declined generally across the whole continent.
*25:38.000- 25:43.200* :  Looking at these birds of prey, I wonder what role they play in the ecological system?
*25:43.780- 25:49.960* :  Yeah, they play a really important role. I think you need to think about raptors as our
*25:50.720- 25:55.120* :  big predators in the sky. Just like lions and hyenas are here on the ground,
*25:56.080- 26:02.940* :  we have the same up in the air. So, these are the species that are controlling prey populations,
*26:04.000- 26:13.360* :  things like insects, small birds, rodents in your agricultural farms. So, these are populations
*26:13.580- 26:19.660* :  that control those prey populations, and we've seen in other areas across the globe where
*26:19.900- 26:26.580* :  when you lose the top predators, you basically have a whole cascade of effects on the ecosystem
*26:27.040- 26:30.640* :  and everything that exists below these top predators.
*26:34.020- 26:40.120* :  Most distant planets in our solar system, Neptune and Uranus, share surprising similarities
*26:40.120- 26:46.100* :  in their colors, which have been revealed by new images. Neptune was previously widely believed
*26:46.100- 26:52.280* :  to have been a vibrant blue, while Uranus was thought to be more green. However, a study conducted
*26:52.280- 26:59.400* :  by scientists from the University of Oxford suggests both planets are a comparable shade of greenish
*26:59.400- 27:05.200* :  blue. So, why do we previously think they had different colors? Here's our science correspondent,
*27:05.200- 27:10.660* :  Jonathan Amos. It's a little bit of an accident of history, I guess,
*27:10.660- 27:15.540* :  Nigel, is what you would say. So, these images that we've all kind of become accustomed to
*27:16.320- 27:21.800* :  delivered to us by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, this fantastic space probe that's still going.
*27:21.800- 27:28.900* :  It's about a 20 billion kilometer journey so far beyond our solar system, but it went past
*27:28.900- 27:36.480* :  these ice giants, as scientists call them, back in the late 1980s, sent back pictures with cameras
*27:36.480- 27:43.300* :  that were 1960s, 1970s technology, and they interpreted the colors, the filters that they used
*27:43.380- 27:50.380* :  at the time, and they gave us close-up pictures of these planets for the very first time.
*27:50.380- 27:54.860* :  And in the case of Neptune, which has got this sort of rather gaudy blue color that we've become
*27:54.860- 28:00.420* :  used to, NASA, in their caption that they released with that image, did say that they'd stretch
*28:01.700- 28:07.640* :  to enhance certain features like clouds, the bands in the atmosphere, but that's kind of been
*28:07.640- 28:14.120* :  lost over time. We've become used to this bluish interpretation of Neptune, but of course,
*28:14.120- 28:18.800* :  you know, newer technology comes along, we've got great telescopes now, and they've been able
*28:18.800- 28:24.700* :  to revisit those pictures and give us a true view of what the planets look like.
*28:25.260- 28:28.760* :  And beyond the color similarity, what else did we learn about these planets?
*28:30.600- 28:38.080* :  Well, Uranus is quite interesting. Uranus actually changes its color as viewed from Earth as it
*28:38.080- 28:42.480* :  goes around the sun, takes a long time. Uranus is really odd because it's kind of like on its side,
*28:42.480- 28:50.300* :  it rotates on its side, and that makes it put its poles towards the sun, and as it does that,
*28:50.900- 28:57.940* :  then it sort of modifies its green color through time. But you shouldn't really be surprised
*28:58.000- 29:04.600* :  to see scientists interpreting colors the way that they do. I mean, a good example is we've
*29:04.600- 29:09.880* :  had a brand new picture of Uranus from the James Webb Space Telescope recently. Now, James Webb
*29:09.880- 29:15.920* :  detects infrared light. You and I can't see infrared light, so they have to interpret those images
*29:15.920- 29:21.000* :  that come down, adding color to those images that come down. You know, James Webb, when it looks
*29:21.000- 29:27.800* :  at Uranus and sees its fabulous rings, it has rings. It looks like a gaudy dartboard, if I can
*29:27.800- 29:34.780* :  put it that way. You wouldn't see that if you were there. But we need these different ways of
*29:34.900- 29:41.720* :  looking at objects in space to enable us to interpret what we're seeing. And in the case of
*29:42.040- 29:47.640* :  James Webb and Uranus, it's about seeing those 13 rings that the planet has, which in the voyager
*29:47.640- 29:54.960* :  image of Uranus, you don't see because they're quite diffuse. Jonathan Amos, in a career that lasted
*29:54.960- 30:02.080* :  over six decades, Glinnis Jones appeared in more than 60 films. The British actor, who died in
*30:02.080- 30:07.920* :  Los Angeles at the age of 100, was best known for playing the suffragette mother Winifred Banks
*30:07.920- 30:14.420* :  in Mary Poppins. She starred alongside Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in the 1964 musical.
*30:15.120- 30:21.620* :  Later, on Broadway, Glinnis Jones sang Sending the Clowns, which was written by one of America's
*30:21.620- 30:27.940* :  greatest composers and lyricists, Stephen Sondheim. As Vincent Doud reports, her first big screen
*30:27.940- 30:35.240* :  role came in the 1948 comedy Miranda. You know a lot about music. No, practically nothing. I have
*30:35.240- 30:41.560* :  rather a nice voice to know. Glinnis Jones was born into an acting family. Her first film was in
*30:41.560- 30:48.580* :  1938. A decade later, her sexy performance as a mermaid in Miranda made her a star in Britain.
*30:48.580- 30:55.020* :  The first Hollywood movie was The Court Jester with Danny K. On stage and screen, reviewers
*30:55.020- 31:01.840* :  almost always noted her slightly unusual husky voice. I don't think I have a typically English voice.
*31:02.500- 31:11.260* :  I've played quite a few American roles in America and just softened the A's a little bit,
*31:11.260- 31:15.820* :  and I get away with it. Glinnis Jones had already made a couple of films for Disney,
*31:15.820- 31:23.000* :  when in 1964 they cast her as the suffragette mother in one of their all-time hits, Mary Poppins.
*31:35.640- 31:42.560* :  But her career highlight was her return to the Broadway stage in 1973. In a little night music,
*31:42.880- 31:47.180* :  Steven Sondheim wrote for John's what became his biggest song.
*31:56.640- 32:02.340* :  As a singer, Glinnis Jones had limited technique, but Steven Sondheim knew her distinctive vocal
*32:02.340- 32:07.760* :  delivery would give sending the clowns the poignancy the moment called for on stage.
*32:14.540- 32:21.660* :  Well, maybe next year.
*32:27.100- 32:29.760* :  Vincent Dowd on The Life of Glinnis Jones.
*32:33.080- 32:37.620* :  And that's all for us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later,
*32:38.120- 32:42.200* :  and tomorrow, Jackie Leonard will also have another happy part.
*32:43.220- 32:47.240* :  Yes, in this week's edition, the detective work of a photographer in Pakistan
*32:47.240- 32:53.380* :  that reunited a British artist with her lost portfolio. From Australia, the parents who powered
*32:53.380- 32:58.580* :  their son's dialysis machine with their electric car when terrible storms took out their electricity
*32:58.580- 33:05.700* :  supply, the Hawaiian jewelers restoring precious possessions left charred by last year's wildfires
*33:05.700- 33:12.480* :  on Maui, and a new sports star, Luke the Nuke, the teenager who has captured world attention and
*33:12.480- 33:17.460* :  brought a whole new audience to dots. All on this week's edition of The Happy Pod,
*33:17.460- 33:22.480* :  available from Saturday the 6th of January. If you want to comment on this podcast or the
