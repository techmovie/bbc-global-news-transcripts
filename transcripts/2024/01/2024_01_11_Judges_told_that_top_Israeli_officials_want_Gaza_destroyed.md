*00:11.680- 00:20.820* :  by advertising. I'm Katya Adler and today on the global story, I'll speak to bestselling author
*00:20.820- 00:27.340* :  and documentary maker John Ronson about America's culture wars. COVID conspiracies, racial and
*00:27.340- 00:33.040* :  gender identity politics, free speech culture wars, they all snowballs during COVID lockdown,
*00:33.040- 00:37.840* :  but what role are they likely to play in this year's presidential election in the US?
*00:37.840- 00:43.260* :  The global story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.
*00:43.920- 00:46.220* :  Find us wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*00:53.060- 00:58.420* :  I was one of many people that were victims who was used by somebody who was psychopathic.
*00:58.600- 01:03.860* :  Let's tell this story. World of Secrets Season 2, The Disciples.
*01:04.380- 01:10.020* :  Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC
*01:10.020- 01:17.160* :  World Service. I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday, January 11th, these are our main
*01:17.160- 01:22.700* :  stories. Israel has accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, where you hear from
*01:22.700- 01:27.840* :  the international court of justice in the Hague, and have a furious response from a former advisor
*01:27.840- 01:34.340* :  to the Israeli Prime Minister. China issues a stark warning to voters in Taiwan two days before they
*01:34.340- 01:40.700* :  go to the polls to elect a new president, and Bitcoin goes mainstream in the US. Will that help
*01:40.700- 01:49.020* :  end the wild volatility of cryptocurrencies? Also in this podcast, the perfume in Italy that for
*01:49.040- 01:57.380* :  many, may wreak of a violent and bloody past. And, that is some group of people, thousands.
*01:58.720- 02:03.880* :  The skyscraper that's helped to find Donald Trump, and that he may be about to lose.
*02:07.860- 02:12.680* :  There have been heated exchanges between rival supporters of Israel and the Palestinians
*02:12.680- 02:17.580* :  outside the international court of justice in the Hague. They'd gathered for the hearing of a case
*02:17.580- 02:23.680* :  brought by South Africa, which alleges that Israel's military offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide.
*02:24.660- 02:30.020* :  A crowd watching a live stream of the hearing chanted slogans, including Israel is a
*02:30.020- 02:40.420* :  terrorist state, free, free Palestine. While inside the court, a lawyer representing South Africa,
*02:40.420- 02:45.960* :  Adela Hasim, set out the reasons for calling Israel's actions in Gaza genocide.
*02:46.840- 02:52.960* :  Israel has now damaged or destroyed an estimated 355,000 Palestinian homes,
*02:53.020- 02:58.400* :  leaving at least half a million Palestinians with no home to return to.
*02:58.940- 03:05.980* :  The special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons explains that houses
*03:05.980- 03:13.420* :  and infrastructure, quote, have been raised to the ground, frustrating any realistic prospects
*03:13.420- 03:19.760* :  for displaced cousins to return home, repeating a long history of mass forced displacement
*03:19.760- 03:25.660* :  of Palestinians by Israel. Well, Israel has dismissed the case as baseless.
*03:26.440- 03:31.840* :  For an Israeli view of it, we've been hearing from Caroline Glick, a former foreign policy advisor
*03:31.840- 03:35.920* :  to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She's been talking to Rob Young.
*03:36.800- 03:41.660* :  First of all, 86% of the Palestinian's not only in Gaza, but in the West Bank as well,
*03:42.380- 03:46.760* :  support the atrocities of October 7th. This is surveys taken by the Palestinians themselves,
*03:46.760- 03:53.980* :  not by Israel. And the notion that when Israeli Jews say things like this, that it means that we're
*03:53.980- 04:00.340* :  carrying out a genocide, whereas nothing of that sort, no obscenity like this would ever be
*04:01.040- 04:06.560* :  launched against any other people on the face of the earth tells you exactly what the nature of
*04:06.560- 04:11.400* :  the allegations are by the South Africans and exactly what the nature of the ICJ is.
*04:11.500- 04:15.940* :  Right now, in addition to the large death toll, which the Hamas run health ministry puts at more
*04:15.940- 04:20.780* :  than 23,000, we know that 300,000 homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed.
*04:20.780- 04:26.560* :  Infrastructure has been damaged. 85% of people have been displaced. The Supreme Court
*04:26.560- 04:32.000* :  universities, the public archive, other public buildings have been destroyed. At the very least,
*04:32.660- 04:38.720* :  would you accept the military response has been disproportionate, effectively over the top,
*04:38.720- 04:47.700* :  if not genocidal? No, not at all, not at all. Israel's military response to a genocidal attack
*04:47.700- 04:52.820* :  by a genocidal army whose declared purpose is the annihilation of the Jewish people has been
*04:52.820- 04:59.300* :  to go out and root in branch, root out Hamas's military infrastructure. And you know the funny thing
*04:59.300- 05:03.980* :  is that in every single private home that Israel has entered, they have found weapons. They have
*05:03.980- 05:09.380* :  found collachnical rifles. They have found RPGs. They found them in children's beds. They found
*05:09.380- 05:17.000* :  them in schools, in mosques, in hospitals. Every single aspect of Gaza, the infrastructure of that
*05:17.000- 05:23.380* :  regime and that people were mobilized fully on behalf of the commitment of genocide against Israel.
*05:23.380- 05:28.840* :  You go into an Israeli house, you don't find RPGs in the trundles of children's bed. You find
*05:28.840- 05:35.940* :  comforters and blankets and stuffed animals, but not in Gaza. You'll open up the rooms of children,
*05:35.940- 05:42.060* :  you look at their their backpacks with Hello Kitty on them and you find IEDs. When you say
*05:42.060- 05:46.040* :  there are weapons and children in children's pockets and the like. Are you suggesting that that
*05:46.040- 05:52.100* :  makes children legitimate targets? I'm saying that when you use civilian targets to carry out military
*05:52.100- 05:58.020* :  operations under binding international law, that site becomes a military target. When you're dealing
*05:58.020- 06:02.780* :  with an illegal terrorist organization, who's goal, who's signed quite none, its reason for
*06:02.780- 06:09.100* :  existing is to eliminate your people and you find that the entire infrastructure of life in that
*06:09.100- 06:16.220* :  area in Gaza is mobilized and organized around the single purpose of killing you and your children
*06:16.220- 06:20.920* :  then you understand the nature of the enemy that is rules fighting. That's Caroline Glick. Well,
*06:20.920- 06:25.860* :  I corresponded and a hologon is in the hage and has been attending the hearing. In court today,
*06:25.860- 06:32.120* :  as South Africa laid out some of the evidence it said of Israel's violation of the genocide
*06:32.120- 06:37.100* :  convention, including pointing to the mass killing of Palestinians in military bombardments,
*06:37.100- 06:42.480* :  deliberate displacement of huge swathes of the population. The creation of what South Africa
*06:42.480- 06:48.320* :  described as siege conditions calculated to bring about the Palestinian's physical destruction.
*06:48.320- 06:54.440* :  If not in bombings, then through starvation, dehydration or lack of access to medical help,
*06:54.440- 06:59.980* :  they also reference statements which they said were of genocidal intent by Israeli officials.
*06:59.980- 07:04.840* :  All of this taken together, South Africa argues represents a deliberate attempt by Israel to
*07:04.840- 07:11.180* :  erase, in whole apart, the Palestinian population in Gaza and so they have asked the judges to
*07:11.180- 07:18.460* :  urgently intervene to issue this injunction. They're asking the judges to urge Israel to stop its
*07:18.460- 07:22.900* :  military campaign. Now, the Israelis will give their testimony tomorrow, but they strongly deny
*07:22.900- 07:27.080* :  the accusations, don't they? Absolutely. Israel has described these accusations as
*07:27.080- 07:34.400* :  baseless. We heard from Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday evening. He said that there was no
*07:34.400- 07:41.320* :  intention by Israel to remove Palestinians from Gaza or permanently occupy the strip. But what
*07:41.320- 07:48.800* :  we're witnessing here is an increasing desire by different countries to use this court as a forum
*07:48.800- 07:53.980* :  to try and exert influence over these types of conflicts. And we saw the same with Russia and
*07:53.980- 08:01.540* :  Ukraine. We saw the same with China and Myanmar. And the judges have limited powers. So they can
*08:01.540- 08:09.240* :  issue preliminary measures, interim measures within weeks, possibly. And that is not the same as
*08:09.240- 08:15.280* :  ruling on the fundamentals, whether or not Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. There is
*08:15.280- 08:20.820* :  a potential, though, for any ruling against Israel to have a political, diplomatic, international
*08:20.860- 08:26.980* :  impact in terms of the kinds of support and opposition to what's happening in Gaza right now.
*08:27.540- 08:34.080* :  Anaheim in the hake. With less than two days to go before the people of Taiwan go to the polls to
*08:34.080- 08:39.400* :  elect a new president, China has unveiled a new vision for an economic and cultural future
*08:39.400- 08:44.640* :  unified with the self-governing island. It's Beijing's latest attempt to influence
*08:44.640- 08:50.960* :  voters in Taiwan, which it claims is Chinese territory and is vowed to retake it by force if necessary.
*08:51.600- 08:56.540* :  Under Xi Jinping's leadership, Beijing has taken an ever sharper and often more aggressive tone
*08:56.540- 09:02.320* :  towards Taiwan, warning the world that it alone will decide how and when unification will happen.
*09:02.980- 09:05.240* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicker has this report.
*09:06.220- 09:12.460* :  We've made it to the closest point on the Chinese mainland to Taiwan. This is on Pincan Island.
*09:13.400- 09:18.900* :  There's a busload of Chinese tourists making the love-heart sign in front of the lighthouse.
*09:20.280- 09:27.400* :  You can only really make out a wee bit of Taiwan. Just or rock in the distance, but the rest is lost in
*09:27.400- 09:35.280* :  fog. My biggest wish to be here is that I hope the island of Taiwan can return to our
*09:35.300- 09:39.880* :  motherland soon. This feeling has become stronger why I am here.
*09:41.720- 09:48.100* :  61-year-old Suresh Yowen has traveled hundreds of miles from the north west of China just for
*09:48.100- 09:49.200* :  the glimpse of Taiwan.
*09:51.920- 09:56.080* :  Even if Taiwan is taken back, I hope he's done via peace for negotiations.
*09:57.060- 10:02.860* :  In this way, there is no harm inflicted. If there is a war, the casualties will be huge.
*10:03.780- 10:04.400* :  We want peace.
*10:06.560- 10:12.740* :  The blustery, rocky outcrop marked as 68 nautical miles from Taiwan is as close as people from
*10:12.740- 10:18.140* :  mainland China can get. The government banned individual tourists from traveling to the
*10:18.140- 10:25.240* :  self-governed island back in 2019. But some who live and work here on China's Pincan Island,
*10:25.720- 10:28.740* :  really think about their neighbour, which is just a few hours away by boat.
*10:30.800- 10:35.720* :  Dozens of local workers huddled together out of the wind trying to sort abalone shells for
*10:35.720- 10:40.820* :  harvesting. They barely look up as they speak to us. They need to keep working to earn money.
*10:43.100- 10:48.780* :  I don't care whether it's reunified or not. It's up to the officials, we just want enough to eat.
*10:50.160- 10:55.400* :  A walking down what is known is the three lanes and seven alleys. These are beautiful,
*10:56.180- 11:02.340* :  wooden, traditional houses bedecked with red lanterns. Many Taiwanese are thought to be descendants
*11:02.340- 11:07.700* :  of people from this province. Beijing often uses these ties as an argument for integration.
*11:07.700- 11:13.220* :  It's part of a vision for China's unified future. Do you think there's a special relationship
*11:13.220- 11:19.320* :  between the people here in this province? There are communications between the two sides and
*11:19.320- 11:27.460* :  the future will become like a family. As they think about love on the streets here,
*11:27.840- 11:33.000* :  many doubt that Beijing will want a war in its doorstep as it battles an economic downturn.
*11:33.740- 11:39.360* :  China is trying to entice the people of Taiwan to its shores with a message of familial love.
*11:40.400- 11:45.080* :  But as it continues to carry out raw displays of military power around the island,
*11:45.700- 11:50.200* :  the sound of warships will likely drown out any acts of wooing.
*11:52.500- 11:57.940* :  Laura Bickert reporting there. Now to Italy, where a new perfume has been making headlines,
*11:58.100- 12:01.580* :  perhaps more for the taste it leaves in the mouth rather than its smell.
*12:02.360- 12:08.360* :  Launched by the TikTok star Nonsia Giuliano, O'Leo is a fragrance named after her father,
*12:08.360- 12:13.780* :  Carvine Giuliano, an infamous mafia boss in Naples, otherwise known as the Lion.
*12:14.340- 12:20.960* :  He's seen as a local folk hero by some. Nonsia has already sold out her first batch of perfume.
*12:20.960- 12:26.020* :  But for other people, it reeks of a violent and bloody past. Tom Kington is the time's
*12:26.020- 12:31.600* :  newspapers correspondent in Rome. He's been telling me what's so controversial about Carvine Giuliano.
*12:32.340- 12:40.200* :  He was a member of the infamous Giuliano clan, which was pretty dominant amongst the local
*12:40.200- 12:46.460* :  mafia clans in Naples in the 80s. That was so-called Kamora Mafia in the city.
*12:47.020- 12:52.520* :  There were lots of them, lots of brothers, and Carvine stood out because he was quite a charismatic
*12:52.520- 13:00.520* :  figure. Apart from dealing in drugs and extortion, this was a family that made friends with
*13:00.540- 13:06.080* :  a local footballer at the time, Diego Maradona, the Argentine star, who was playing for
*13:06.380- 13:12.680* :  the local team happily at the time. There are some very iconic photographs of Diego Maradona posing
*13:12.680- 13:19.500* :  with the Giuliano brothers, including Carvine in their luxury pad in Naples. He's gone down in
*13:19.500- 13:26.400* :  history as both a gangster, but as you said, a sort of folk hero. We got to remember that
*13:26.400- 13:32.240* :  mafia bosses in cities like Naples are often loved because they're seen as sort of bestowing
*13:32.240- 13:38.260* :  welfare upon poor residents. Perhaps if you're out of money, you'll go to them. They'll give you
*13:38.260- 13:42.760* :  a turkey for Christmas or they'll help you with a loan. Always comes at a price, but nevertheless,
*13:42.760- 13:49.440* :  they have that kind of dual reputation. Strange nostalgia amongst some people, but I imagine
*13:49.440- 13:53.360* :  there are a lot of critics. What are people saying about this perfume particularly? Well, it has
*13:53.640- 14:00.300* :  prompted some very fierce criticism from an Italian MP, Francesco Emilio Borrelli, who said,
*14:00.300- 14:06.860* :  and I quote, he said that Carvine's daughter, Nonsia, who has promoted this perfume,
*14:07.260- 14:12.380* :  is trying to push the image of a man as a saint and a hero. Whereas we do well to remember,
*14:12.380- 14:17.500* :  he was a member of the Camorum Athea, and he was a guy that you were well advised to stay clear of.
*14:18.260- 14:25.720* :  Tom Kington of the Times. Still to come, we meet the top 10 weird and wonderful species discovered
*14:25.720- 14:35.320* :  in 2023. Some people play golf on the weekends. I hunt con artists. Unmissable podcasts from the
*14:35.320- 14:40.980* :  BBC World Service. Our county mayor or great team glided by mystical forces we can't comprehend.

*14:45.480- 14:50.400* :  Every minute there's bombing and shouting. There is no safety. If I get any internet connection,

*15:10.640- 15:17.200* :  maker John Ronson about America's culture wars. Covid conspiracies, racial and gender identity
*15:17.200- 15:23.460* :  politics, free speech culture wars, they all snowballs during Covid lockdown. But what role are
*15:23.460- 15:28.480* :  they likely to play in this year's presidential election in the US? The global story brings you
*15:28.480- 15:33.980* :  fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC journalists around the world. Find us wherever you
*15:33.980- 15:45.720* :  get your BBC podcasts. The cryptocurrency industry has been given a major boost
*15:45.720- 15:51.040* :  after US financial regulators finally cleared some major investment funds to start trading on
*15:51.040- 15:57.300* :  stock exchanges. The approval of what are known as exchange traded funds or ETFs is seen by
*15:57.300- 16:01.820* :  supporters as a watershed moment for crypto. Jotide is our cyber reporter.
*16:02.340- 16:07.240* :  An ETF is a way to invest in something without actually buying it. So for example,
*16:07.340- 16:14.280* :  you could have a pot of funds, a portfolio of funds of let's say tech giant shares mixed in
*16:14.280- 16:19.740* :  with insurance company shares or a bit of dog billion or silver billion and I would buy shares in
*16:19.740- 16:25.400* :  this ETF and that way when the price on the value of those shares or materials go up or down,
*16:25.400- 16:31.360* :  I benefit or obviously lose out as well. So I'm effectively allowing myself to be a part of the,
*16:31.700- 16:36.680* :  I've got skin in the game without actually having to go through the process of buying these shares
*16:36.680- 16:42.160* :  or these these materials and now of course Bitcoin. Now this move was resisted for some time because
*16:42.160- 16:48.200* :  of concerns about fraud and manipulation. Is this this seminal moment for cryptocurrency now?
*16:48.200- 16:52.420* :  Is it going to be more stable now? A lot of people are saying that. Yes, I think there's been so
*16:52.420- 16:58.100* :  much excitement about ETFs that the more specifically called spot ETFs because previously there
*16:58.480- 17:04.400* :  there have been Bitcoin investments in ETFs that as part of futures trading, which is not quite
*17:04.400- 17:10.820* :  the same. It's an indirect way of being of having exposure to Bitcoin. But now with the spot
*17:11.240- 17:17.000* :  Bitcoin ETFs, what we're seeing is we're going to see all these massive investment firms in the US.
*17:17.000- 17:21.500* :  So there are 11 of them who did have applied to do this. They're all going to start literally buying
*17:21.500- 17:27.120* :  up Bitcoin and storing that and having that as part of their custodian as part of the portfolio
*17:27.120- 17:31.160* :  for each ETF that they're selling to their customers. So a lot of people are very excited and they
*17:31.160- 17:36.360* :  have been for a few months now in the crypto world because we are going to see billions of dollars
*17:36.360- 17:41.360* :  poured into buying Bitcoin. And then of course, the potential rejuvenation of the cryptocurrency
*17:41.500- 17:46.320* :  industry as a whole because we've had this about a year and a half has been what's been
*17:46.320- 17:52.080* :  described as the crypto winter where the price of one Bitcoin went right down to about $16,000
*17:52.080- 17:58.120* :  from a high of $70,000 and we saw all these scandals in the industry. And then this discussion
*17:58.120- 18:03.320* :  of the spot ETFs read its head about six months ago and it's just got bigger and bigger.
*18:03.700- 18:08.260* :  And the price of Bitcoin has risen as a result of that and people are excited about the fact that
*18:08.800- 18:13.400* :  if you've got a healthy Bitcoin market, if one coin is worth a lot, suddenly you've got a lot more
*18:13.400- 18:18.820* :  people spending money in general on the cryptocurrency industry, which can be quite exciting with the
*18:18.960- 18:22.320* :  the kind of products that you can build based on this technology of blockchain.
*18:22.980- 18:28.140* :  Joe Tidy. Now there is a lot of excitement in the run up to this weekend. There's football teams
*18:28.140- 18:34.080* :  from across the continent head to ivory coast for the Africa cup of nations. But Gambia's
*18:34.080- 18:38.620* :  squad have already faced difficulties before even getting there. Their plane had to turn around
*18:38.620- 18:43.420* :  after nine minutes in the air because of a lack of oxygen with passengers falling asleep and
*18:43.420- 18:49.080* :  feeling dizzy. It's our sports news correspondent Alex Kapstik. According to the Gambia's Belgian
*18:49.080- 18:54.360* :  coach Tom Sanfee, the local crew in Banjul said there was a problem with the air conditioning on
*18:54.360- 18:59.680* :  the flight, but that it would be fine once they were airborne. But shortly after taking off,
*18:59.680- 19:05.040* :  he said people including himself started falling asleep with players complaining of extreme
*19:05.040- 19:11.080* :  dizziness and headaches. He said they were in danger of dying from carbon monoxide poisoning,
*19:11.100- 19:16.920* :  a claim that's been disputed by the Gambian Football Federation's president who was also on
*19:16.920- 19:22.940* :  the flight. The plane was forced to turn around and the squad is now recovering in Banjul waiting
*19:23.100- 19:28.480* :  for another aircraft to take them to ivory coast for the competition. It had already been a
*19:28.480- 19:33.480* :  troubled buildup for the Gambia with players refusing to train over what they claimed were unpaid
*19:33.480- 19:39.440* :  bonuses, although that issue is said to have been resolved. Their first match in ivory coast is on
*19:39.440- 19:45.380* :  Monday when they take on the Africa Cup of Nations defending champions Senegal. Alex Kapstik.
*19:46.240- 19:51.320* :  Donald Trump is expected back in court in New York today as closing arguments begin in the
*19:51.500- 19:56.040* :  civil fraud trial that threatens the former president's business empire. His lawyers are going to
*19:56.040- 20:01.020* :  seek to convince the judge who will decide the case, that he should not be barred from doing business
*20:01.020- 20:06.340* :  in New York City and that he should retain control of his properties like Trump Tower.
*20:07.000- 20:11.660* :  The BBC's New York correspondent Netta Tulfik takes a look at how that skyscraper is defined
*20:11.660- 20:17.840* :  Donald Trump's brand and what losing it would mean. Few buildings have been so closely tied to
*20:17.840- 20:23.820* :  its owner in the public imagination as this Trump Tower. Built in the 80s era of excess,
*20:23.820- 20:29.700* :  the atrium boasts pink marble and brass, a design that was meant to exude wealth and to
*20:29.700- 20:34.460* :  announce the arrival of the real estate developer Donald Trump to Manhattan and the world.
*20:41.000- 20:46.340* :  Its style now outdated was once celebrated and became central to Trump's identities.
*20:47.020- 20:51.880* :  Former Forbes researcher and writer Jonathan Greenberg said the year before Trump Tower was
*20:51.880- 20:58.100* :  completed, Trump lied about his assets to make it onto their richest Americans list, claiming a
*20:58.100- 21:03.380* :  net worth of $100 million when in reality he was worth less than $5 million.
*21:03.740- 21:12.460* :  We in the media were unprepared for anyone who lies as effectively and shamelessly as Donald Trump.
*21:13.100- 21:15.440* :  Let's you first see Donald Trump.
*21:15.660- 21:22.440* :  Infamously, in a 1984 phone call with Greenberg, Trump pretended to be a fake executive at his
*21:27.200- 21:31.820* :  organization. In hindsight, Greenberg believes Trump knew being on the list would be game-changing
*21:31.820- 21:40.300* :  for his borrowing power and image. Even while he was facing spectacular financial losses in the
*21:40.300- 21:44.620* :  early 90s, he was appearing in Hollywood as a wealthy business tycoon.
*21:54.880- 22:01.260* :  That image stuck, and in 2005 he reinvented himself as a reality star on the apprentice,
*22:01.900- 22:04.040* :  which was set in his Fifth Avenue property.
*22:04.440- 22:11.580* :  On the other side of that famous catchphrase, the contestants in a mock boardroom.
*22:11.720- 22:17.080* :  The show set the stage for his White House run, which began with a history making ride down
*22:17.080- 22:21.080* :  the Golden Escalator in Trump Tower's atrium to announce his plans.
*22:27.900- 22:33.420* :  In reality, there were only a few dozen spectators here, but over the course of the campaign,
*22:33.420- 22:38.520* :  the size of his rallies grew, culminating in a shocking and divisive election victory.
*22:38.520- 22:42.960* :  Overnight, Trump Tower became the de facto presidential transition office,
*22:42.960- 22:48.740* :  in the same space where the apprentice was filmed, but it also became the scene of frequent protests.
*22:53.380- 22:57.940* :  His presidency ultimately killed his image in New York and led to scrutiny of his business
*22:57.940- 23:03.360* :  practices. His longtime friend and fellow real estate developer, who testified for the defense
*23:03.360- 23:09.080* :  in the trial, Steve Whitkopf, insists Trump didn't do anything wrong and will never stop fighting
*23:09.080- 23:14.400* :  to save his empire and Trump Tower. I think if the end result was he lost it, he would feel
*23:14.400- 23:18.380* :  it would be an indignity, but hopefully we're not going to get to that place.
*23:23.620- 23:29.220* :  Trump Tower has become a mecca to his supporters, who often leave with his political merchandise.
*23:29.600- 23:34.200* :  Losing this building would be an epic chapter in his downfall in this city,
*23:34.680- 23:40.620* :  but equally, if it is unaffected by this case, it will stand as a monument to its developer's
*23:40.620- 23:49.800* :  ability to endure. There is still no word on when Boeing's feet of 737 Max 9 aircraft will
*23:49.800- 23:55.760* :  be allowed to fly again. Almost 200 aircraft have been grounded since a panel blew off one flight
*23:55.760- 24:01.820* :  in mid-air, causing depressurization of the cabin and terrified passengers' possessions to be
*24:01.820- 24:07.520* :  sucked out at almost 5,000 meters altitude. Miraculously, everybody on board survived.
*24:07.520- 24:13.820* :  Inspections have since found multiple examples of loose parts on other 737 Max 9 planes.
*24:13.820- 24:20.520* :  In the latest safety concerns related to the 737 Max fleet, the chair of the US Senate subcommittee
*24:20.520- 24:26.460* :  on Aviation Safety is Senator Tammy Duckwood. She told Rob Young that there were still many
*24:26.460- 24:32.760* :  questions to be answered. This raises questions about everything from the program that exists that
*24:32.760- 24:38.540* :  allows for self-certification that had happened in the past, and then also to the incident here
*24:38.540- 24:44.040* :  with the cockpit door that popped open apparently. That, according to Boeing, is a design feature,
*24:44.040- 24:48.480* :  but was not in the manual. So the two pilots on this flight did not know that their cockpit door
*24:48.480- 24:54.180* :  was going to fly open if there was a decompression that happened. So once the 737 Max 9 is
*24:54.420- 24:57.600* :  back in the air, because I didn't think there was any suggestion that it won't be back in the air
*24:57.600- 25:03.860* :  at some point, however long that takes. Are you sufficiently confident that Boeing makes its
*25:03.860- 25:08.740* :  planes in the way it ought to, that you would get on that plane happily and would feel safe?
*25:09.040- 25:14.020* :  I fly on that plane on a regular basis. I am confident in the maintenance process,
*25:14.300- 25:17.700* :  and obviously since I'm the one that's getting on it and I am the chair of the Aviation
*25:17.700- 25:20.120* :  Committee, I'm going to make sure it's as safe as it can possibly be.
*25:20.320- 25:24.880* :  Now you would like there to be a new law which would require the Federal Aviation
*25:24.940- 25:31.800* :  Administration to change emergency evacuation procedures when it comes to emergency
*25:31.800- 25:36.200* :  landings like we saw in the case of this Alaska Airlines plane. Why is that needed?
*25:36.460- 25:42.280* :  Well the FAA has been certifying that we can evacuate aircraft with the 90 seconds,
*25:42.620- 25:47.400* :  and that is a standard set in the 1960s, and it turned out there were only putting 60 passengers
*25:47.400- 25:52.700* :  into aircraft. Nobody under the age of 18, nobody over the age of 60, nobody with the disability,
*25:52.700- 25:59.620* :  no carry on baggage. So in this new FAA authorization bill that we are about to pass out of Congress,
*25:59.620- 26:05.540* :  I actually have inserted a requirement with FAA to develop new standards that will include things
*26:05.540- 26:11.000* :  like persons with disabilities, children, elderly, people who are hearing impaired, people who don't
*26:11.000- 26:15.560* :  speak English. I want to know how long it takes, and we just had an example with the Japan Airlines
*26:15.560- 26:20.240* :  flight where everything went as well as it could possibly have been, and that was five minutes,
*26:20.240- 26:27.940* :  not 90 seconds. I will send it to Tammy Duckworth. From an underground forest to spectacular orchids,
*26:28.020- 26:33.560* :  scientists say they've discovered 74 new mysterious plants and fungi over the last year.
*26:33.920- 26:39.220* :  Many were found in unlikely places like the top of a volcano or clinging to Antarctic rocks,
*26:39.920- 26:45.420* :  but it looks as if some of them are already facing extinction, if indeed they're not already
*26:45.420- 26:53.560* :  extinct. Among them is the Penangasapterania, a palm that grows underground with fruit. William
*26:53.560- 26:59.520* :  Baker is from the research team at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Q London. This was an absolutely
*26:59.520- 27:05.260* :  amazing find that we made back in 2018, and we described for the first time last year.
*27:05.700- 27:10.920* :  It came about because of a tip off from a Malaysian collaborator of ours, and I was in the field
*27:10.920- 27:16.280* :  in the middle of Borneo with a couple of fantastic students, and we stumbled across this palm
*27:16.280- 27:21.240* :  he'd pointed us to that was a tiny little thing like a seedling on the ground with no sign of
*27:21.240- 27:25.540* :  really anything much going on, and we thought maybe this is his mystery underground palm where we
*27:25.540- 27:31.460* :  started digging and we found flowers and fruits buried deep underground. It kind of makes no sense
*27:31.460- 27:37.080* :  whatsoever. It never shows its flowers and fruits above the ground at all. We really still don't know
*27:37.080- 27:42.840* :  what's out there. There are so many underscribed species out there in nature, and it's really urgent
*27:42.840- 27:49.020* :  business to find out what they are, where they are, what their populations are like, and how close
*27:49.020- 27:54.800* :  they are to extinction that the tragedy is that with plants we believe that perhaps three quarters
*27:55.420- 28:01.160* :  of the underscribed plant species out there may already be threatened with extinction. We don't
*28:01.180- 28:08.240* :  know what any given species does in nature. We don't know. It's part in the mechanism of how ecosystems
*28:08.240- 28:14.200* :  work. We don't know what they can bring to us in terms of food or medicine. I was biologist Dr
*28:14.200- 28:20.540* :  William Baker. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global
