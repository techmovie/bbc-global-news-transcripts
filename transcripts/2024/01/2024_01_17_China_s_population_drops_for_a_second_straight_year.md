*01:39.040- 01:44.040* :  I'm Janet Joliel and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 17th of January, these are our main
*01:44.040- 01:44.640* :  stories.
*01:45.380- 01:50.180* :  Anna's birth rate has dropped to another record low, with official figures showing
*01:50.180- 01:52.780* :  its population has continued to fall.
*01:53.620- 01:58.400* :  Medicines for hostages seized by Hamas have arrived in Egypt ahead of their transfer
*01:58.400- 01:59.120* :  to Gaza.
*02:00.160- 02:04.980* :  Russian police clash with protesters angered by the jailing of an ethnic rights activist.
*02:07.740- 02:08.360* :  Awesome in this podcast?
*02:08.360- 02:12.300* :  I could just go around, not attach to a machine.
*02:13.060- 02:16.940* :  You could walk around so freely, I could go outside.
*02:18.360- 02:22.500* :  The drug making life a little easier for young blood cancer patients.
*02:26.960- 02:31.400* :  It wasn't that long ago that China barred couples from having more than one child because
*02:31.400- 02:34.100* :  of fears that its population was growing too quickly.
*02:34.820- 02:38.520* :  Now it's dealing with the opposite problem, a shrinking population.
*02:38.980- 02:41.580* :  It's fallen for the second year in a row.
*02:42.020- 02:45.760* :  The decline of two million is more than double that of the previous year.
*02:46.380- 02:50.400* :  And last year China lost the title of the world's most populated nation to India.
*02:50.960- 02:53.040* :  These Beijing residents shared their thoughts.
*02:56.260- 03:01.980* :  I think that population decline for us is actually an historical inevitability because
*03:01.980- 03:05.620* :  as our country's economy grew, so did our GDP.
*03:06.260- 03:10.680* :  So any country's decline in population follows a boost in GDP growth.
*03:11.460- 03:16.060* :  And as people's living standards improve, this will result in people's unwillingness
*03:16.440- 03:17.400* :  to have more children.
*03:18.000- 03:21.280* :  Also, we are now facing a growing aging population.
*03:24.320- 03:30.060* :  Nowadays childhood is completely occupied by studies and academics, and kids get burnt
*03:30.060- 03:31.260* :  out very easily.
*03:31.920- 03:35.920* :  So a lot of children don't ever experience the sort of joy of childhood.
*03:36.820- 03:42.740* :  While there are still more than 1.4 billion Chinese citizens, our China correspondent Laura
*03:42.740- 03:47.480* :  Biccus says the authorities are worried about the long-term effects of this new demographic
*03:47.480- 03:48.100* :  trend.
*03:48.860- 03:51.200* :  It's hard to know how alarmed the authorities are.
*03:51.200- 03:57.260* :  What they have done over the past few years is try to encourage women in particular to
*03:57.260- 04:00.140* :  have more babies, and that doesn't seem to be working.
*04:00.640- 04:06.540* :  Year after year, there have been more initiatives launched to try to encourage marriage, to try
*04:06.540- 04:12.740* :  to encourage childbirth, to try to encourage couples to come together, emphasise the message
*04:12.740- 04:13.440* :  of marriage.
*04:13.800- 04:17.180* :  And that doesn't seem to be working, and you heard there from some people in the streets
*04:17.180- 04:22.540* :  appear in Beijing talking about why, and that's because many women have been moving to
*04:22.540- 04:27.540* :  the cities, there's been rapid urbanisation, and just like their counterparts in the
*04:27.540- 04:33.460* :  West, for instance, they're prioritising careers, getting a house, putting financial matters
*04:33.820- 04:36.040* :  before getting married and having children.
*04:36.560- 04:40.200* :  And that's something the party wants to kind of see less of, they're trying to encourage
*04:40.200- 04:45.780* :  more women to take the traditional household role at home, but that doesn't seem to be working
*04:45.780- 04:46.480* :  so far.
*04:46.800- 04:51.340* :  The other big problem is that China has more elderly people than anywhere else in the
*04:51.360- 04:55.840* :  world, and they're trying to encourage an economy there, kind of silver, grey-haired economy
*04:55.840- 04:58.540* :  as it's called, for the aging population.
*04:58.880- 05:04.260* :  But the big reason why this is a problem is because a shrinking and an aging population
*05:04.260- 05:09.220* :  means that there are fewer people in the workforce, there are fewer people to provide money
*05:09.220- 05:13.080* :  for healthcare and fewer people to provide for money for pensions, and that is a ticking
*05:13.080- 05:14.160* :  time bomb for China.
*05:14.580- 05:18.980* :  And on top of the fact that there's a disforbling birth rate, there's also been a sharp rise
*05:18.980- 05:21.200* :  in the number of deaths partly because of COVID.
*05:22.020- 05:28.340* :  Well, yet last year, around this time last year, China had just reopened after strict closures,
*05:28.340- 05:33.620* :  strict lockdowns due to COVID, and that meant that the pandemic spread quite quickly throughout
*05:33.620- 05:39.740* :  China, and there was an increase in deaths, but 11 million people have died in total.
*05:40.240- 05:45.940* :  It's hard to know how many people died from COVID, but the death rate is up just a little
*05:45.940- 05:47.080* :  on last year.
*05:47.540- 05:52.980* :  And if this decline continues, what could the long-term impact be on the global economy?
*05:53.820- 05:57.700* :  Well, so far we've seen a slowdown in China's economy, and that can have an impact.
*05:57.700- 06:02.580* :  Elsewhere, remember, China has trade partnerships all over the world, and increasing trade partnerships
*06:02.620- 06:03.360* :  all over the world.
*06:03.360- 06:09.400* :  We saw the impact when US and China had a trade war, and the impact that had on the rest
*06:09.400- 06:13.460* :  of the economy, and how that had trickles down into people's purposes.
*06:13.460- 06:19.360* :  I mean, China's involved in nearly every country in the world when it comes to economic
*06:19.360- 06:19.860* :  deals.
*06:20.320- 06:24.320* :  If China's economy is struggling, the rest of the world struggles along with it.
*06:25.160- 06:30.000* :  Laura Bicker, injuries have been reported among hundreds of protesters who gathered outside
*06:30.000- 06:35.320* :  a courtroom in the Russian Republic of Bashkortistan after a local rights activist was sentenced
*06:35.320- 06:37.180* :  on charges of inciting hatred.
*06:37.840- 06:42.500* :  Street protests are extremely rare in Russia, which has clamped down on dissent since
*06:42.500- 06:47.860* :  launching its full-scale military invasion in Ukraine, and has strict anti-demonstration
*06:47.960- 06:48.680* :  laws anyway.
*06:49.260- 06:51.940* :  Our Europe-reached editor, Alice Adley, reports.
*06:56.040- 07:01.920* :  Right, police fire tear gas at supporters of file Olsenov, who had just been sentenced
*07:01.920- 07:04.060* :  to four years in a penal colony.
*07:04.680- 07:09.960* :  Hundreds of people had gathered outside the time of Bay Mac in the southern Urals, which
*07:09.960- 07:12.520* :  is an area rich in oil and other minerals.
*07:13.100- 07:18.340* :  He was accused of insulting migrants at a demonstration against plans to mine for gold.
*07:19.040- 07:24.500* :  Pictures showed scuffles between police and locals whose snowball projectiles were met
*07:24.500- 07:29.160* :  with batons and tear gas, a number of people were reported to be detained.
*07:30.100- 07:35.620* :  After the verdict, as file Olsenov was led away, he was able to speak to local media.
*07:39.620- 07:45.260* :  My huge thanks to all those who came to support me, I will never forget this, I do not plead
*07:45.260- 07:45.680* :  guilty.
*07:46.460- 07:51.620* :  I've always been struggling for justice, for my people, for my republic, so in Shallah,
*07:52.200- 07:53.420* :  we will see each other again.
*07:54.020- 07:55.320* :  We will appeal this sentence.
*07:56.880- 08:03.500* :  Mr. Olsenov has previously complained about military mobilization in Bashkortistan, calling
*08:03.500- 08:05.960* :  it a genocide of local people.
*08:06.480- 08:10.760* :  There have been long-running claims that a disproportionately high number of ethnic
*08:10.760- 08:16.600* :  minorities in Russia, such as the Bashkir people, native to Bashkortistan, are being
*08:16.600- 08:22.600* :  sent to fight in Ukraine, and also that their land is then appropriated for mining minerals
*08:22.600- 08:23.760* :  such as gold.
*08:24.940- 08:25.780* :  Alice Adely.
*08:26.380- 08:30.980* :  Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky has called for some of the tens of billions of dollars
*08:30.980- 08:34.680* :  in frozen Russian assets to be sent to rebuild his country.
*08:35.220- 08:39.260* :  The Ukrainian leader, who's attending the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland,
*08:39.340- 08:44.940* :  said Western taxpayers should not have to foot the bill when Russian funds are available.
*08:45.540- 08:48.760* :  Mr. Zelensky was speaking to our economic senator, Faisal Islam.
*08:49.720- 08:55.840* :  Over 300 billion dollars of Russian government funds were seized in 2020 after its invasion
*08:55.840- 08:56.540* :  of Ukraine.
*08:57.340- 09:02.720* :  Since then, this huge sum of money has been increasing in value and then tens of billions
*09:02.720- 09:03.480* :  in interest.
*09:04.060- 09:09.420* :  It's that increase in value that the G7 is looking at appropriating to fund Ukraine's
*09:10.180- 09:10.200* :  reconstruction.
*09:11.020- 09:16.860* :  Mr. Zelensky told me the appropriation was urgently required as Russia had done several
*09:16.860- 09:19.520* :  hundred billion dollars of damage to Ukraine.
*09:20.060- 09:21.540* :  They destroyed Ukraine.
*09:22.340- 09:29.540* :  So what we're speaking about, if we have 300 billions of Russia as we have to use them
*09:29.720- 09:35.020* :  but directly to renovation, those who have been destroyed by their missiles.
*09:35.600- 09:40.660* :  The BBC has been told that despite some keenness from the US and UK governments, central
*09:40.660- 09:45.680* :  bankers across Europe have been more skeptical about setting a difficult legal precedent
*09:46.100- 09:48.460* :  that could undermine global financial stability.
*09:49.040- 09:53.220* :  Other nations with difficult relations with the West might withdraw their reserves.
*09:54.300- 09:55.020* :  Faisal Islam.
*09:55.620- 10:00.180* :  Research in the UK suggests a drug that's far more gentle than chemotherapy could offer
*10:00.520- 10:04.020* :  many benefits to children with a type of leukemia or blood cancer.
*10:04.540- 10:08.240* :  The drug is administered at home, meaning children spend far less time in hospital.
*10:08.240- 10:13.000* :  It's already approved for some adults and children in the US and other parts of Europe.
*10:13.600- 10:18.720* :  Now the treatment is being offered to some young people in the UK as part of a long-term
*10:18.720- 10:19.180* :  study.
*10:19.620- 10:23.700* :  Our health reporter, Michelle Roberts, has been to meet one young boy who's benefited.
*10:28.680- 10:31.780* :  Life's getting back to normal for 11-year-old Arthur.
*10:32.140- 10:37.800* :  He's been clear of cancer for almost a year now and is back to enjoying school and hobbies
*10:37.800- 10:39.300* :  like learning violin.
*10:41.100- 10:46.020* :  He was one of the first children in the UK to try out a new type of cancer drug.
*10:46.500- 10:49.860* :  It made me feel a lot better, a lot freer.
*10:50.140- 10:55.420* :  Lina Tumamab or Blina can replace big chunks of aggressive chemotherapy.
*10:56.220- 11:00.400* :  For Arthur, it was the only real option to tackle his blood cancer.
*11:00.420- 11:05.340* :  His mum, Sandrine, explained as she showed me a photograph of Arthur in hospital.
*11:05.780- 11:10.620* :  You can see he's got no hair at all and he's gained quite a lot of weight from the steroids.
*11:11.360- 11:13.500* :  So yeah, you can see the effect of the chemo.
*11:13.840- 11:18.520* :  But then the news came that actually there was still some residual cancer.
*11:18.520- 11:25.320* :  So that particular chemo base had not worked as expected and that's when the doctor's
*11:25.320- 11:27.480* :  advice to go for the Blina treatment.
*11:27.940- 11:30.380* :  It's been such a long time since you've been there.
*11:30.620- 11:34.000* :  Importantly, children can be on Blina at home.
*11:34.520- 11:37.580* :  All of the necessary kit can be carried in a small bag.
*11:38.080- 11:43.120* :  Although he had to wear it day and night, it gave Arthur his freedom back.
*11:43.380- 11:46.900* :  I could go around, not attach to a machine.
*11:47.620- 11:51.580* :  You could walk around so freely, I could go outside.
*11:51.780- 11:57.280* :  His immune system was boosted and actually everything was boosted in his body.
*11:57.280- 11:59.140* :  His energy and his optimism.
*11:59.860- 12:02.420* :  So it was like getting him back.
*12:02.900- 12:03.640* :  So how are you doing?
*12:03.980- 12:04.240* :  Good.
*12:04.720- 12:07.620* :  It's been nearly a year since you finished your treatment, isn't it?
*12:07.760- 12:12.320* :  Doctors say it's a much kinder alternative and could be a game changer.
*12:13.220- 12:18.720* :  Professor Ajay Vora is one of the medical team that's been investigating Blina.
*12:19.140- 12:26.300* :  Chemotherapy are poisons that kill the leukemic cells, but also kill and damage normal cells.
*12:26.300- 12:28.600* :  And that is what causes their side effects.
*12:29.660- 12:35.360* :  So Blina Tumap is a gentle, a kinder treatment that doesn't have the same side effects of
*12:35.360- 12:42.440* :  leukemtherapy, but in a study that we've just published, can cure just as many patients
*12:42.440- 12:43.300* :  as chemotherapy.
*12:43.880- 12:49.500* :  Blina works by seeking out cancer cells so the body's own immune system can then recognize
*12:49.720- 12:50.840* :  and destroy them.
*12:51.440- 12:54.140* :  This death hunt is precisely targeted.
*12:54.720- 12:56.660* :  Healthy cells are untouched.
*12:58.000- 13:04.720* :  It's been a long tough journey made somewhat easier by his new treatment, Arthur tells me.
*13:05.040- 13:07.740* :  That bead represents chemo.
*13:07.880- 13:10.320* :  He's kept a log of his therapy using beads.
*13:11.060- 13:16.160* :  This one's when I had an aesthetic, the red ones are also block transfusions.
*13:16.740- 13:20.480* :  That's when I went overnight at hospital.
*13:20.820- 13:24.940* :  Thanks to all the treatment, Arthur's cancer's now gone.
*13:25.220- 13:29.500* :  New year was when we found out that the Blina had worked and that there was no residual
*13:29.500- 13:29.820* :  cancer.
*13:30.200- 13:33.720* :  So that was just amazing and so we had double celebrations there.
*13:34.900- 13:38.320* :  This mother, Sandrine, ending that report by Michelle Roberts.
*13:41.540- 13:43.100* :  Still to come in the Global News Podcast?
*13:43.620- 13:46.360* :  You're reading the news but you have like an armed police guard outside.
*13:47.000- 13:50.160* :  It's stressed and nervous here.
*13:50.860- 13:51.560* :  It's crazy.
*13:52.500- 13:56.400* :  The Polish journalist caught up in a battle between rival political leaders.
*14:01.340- 14:02.900* :  Remarkable personal stories.
*14:03.100- 14:03.720* :  Trail.
*14:03.900- 14:06.340* :  It runs through my life and runs through my story.
*14:06.480- 14:07.680* :  Deep dive documentaries.
*14:08.120- 14:13.520* :  These children are using their own bags, not to carry books but they carry the drug markets
*14:13.520- 14:15.600* :  Sweden on their shoulders.
*14:16.020- 14:18.400* :  And sport, but not as you know it.
*14:18.460- 14:22.640* :  There's this massive landslide of myth and somewhere in there is the truth.

*15:13.620- 15:15.140* :  From BBC News.
*15:15.960- 15:20.940* :  Hey there, Justin Webb here from the America podcast, I've been podcasting through the night
*15:20.940- 15:26.700* :  from Iowa with my podcast buddies chatting about the caucus here we've got to have a talk
*15:26.720- 15:27.440* :  with Eric Trump.

*15:52.980- 15:54.820* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*15:55.760- 16:00.020* :  More than a hundred hostages have been held in Gaza for more than a hundred days.
*16:00.560- 16:02.500* :  Some of them with serious health conditions.
*16:03.360- 16:05.440* :  Now there's a sliver of good news for them.
*16:05.640- 16:10.740* :  As we record this podcast, two Katari military planes carrying medicines for the hostages
*16:10.740- 16:14.840* :  have landed in Egypt and those medicines are now en route to Gaza.
*16:15.560- 16:20.460* :  This is all part of a deal, broken by Qatar and France, which we'll see more aid delivered
*16:20.460- 16:26.840* :  to Gazans who are suffering hunger and disease on an unprecedented scale, even as the Israeli
*16:26.840- 16:28.120* :  bombardment continues.
*16:28.960- 16:33.940* :  In the southern Gazans, there have been further, more intense Israeli air strikes.
*16:34.540- 16:39.160* :  And in Northern Gaza, there are reports that Israeli tanks have returned, despite Israel
*16:39.160- 16:41.520* :  saying it was planning to scale down operations.
*16:42.240- 16:45.900* :  Our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell, told us more about these developments.
*16:46.840- 16:50.860* :  In the South First of all, we've had residents there describing to us what they've been
*16:50.860- 16:55.000* :  through overnight saying it was really some of the most intense Israeli air strikes that
*16:55.000- 16:59.180* :  they've experienced since the start of the war, that they could also hear a very heavy
*16:59.180- 17:05.080* :  gunfire reverberating across the city as Hamas fighters have been fighting against Israeli
*17:05.080- 17:06.520* :  soldiers at close quarters.
*17:06.520- 17:10.420* :  Of course, we know from the Israeli military that they believe there may be Hamas leaders
*17:10.420- 17:14.900* :  and some of the remaining Israeli hostages hidden underground in this city.
*17:14.900- 17:16.780* :  It's been a main focus of their operations.
*17:17.360- 17:21.880* :  There was one local man who's been sheltering at the Nussel Hospital, one of the main hospitals
*17:21.880- 17:23.740* :  there, saying we were in terror.
*17:23.740- 17:27.800* :  All the kids were screaming and crying, and a local journalist who was there said that
*17:27.800- 17:29.000* :  people were just fleeing away.
*17:29.000- 17:30.700* :  We could see that in some of the scenes.
*17:31.060- 17:31.880* :  They were fleeing westwards.
*17:31.880- 17:35.880* :  He said, not knowing what fate awaited them, and it was really a terrifying night.
*17:36.360- 17:41.300* :  In the north of the Gaza Strip, there had been some hopes after people there reported that
*17:41.520- 17:43.120* :  the tanks were starting to move out.
*17:43.120- 17:48.640* :  We had that reinforced by the Israeli military, basically, saying that it was winding down
*17:48.640- 17:49.600* :  its operations.
*17:49.600- 17:52.900* :  The intensity would soon be lowered in the south, but it would already be lowered it
*17:52.900- 17:53.920* :  said in the north.
*17:54.180- 17:58.480* :  Many people read into that that perhaps, given the dire humanitarian situation where they're
*17:58.780- 18:02.680* :  camped out in the south of the Gaza Strip, now could be the time to return home.
*18:02.760- 18:05.380* :  But people have told us that actually tanks have returned.
*18:05.380- 18:10.140* :  They've been heavy explosions in the past day or so as part of the ongoing Israeli military
*18:10.620- 18:10.640* :  offensive.
*18:10.880- 18:13.500* :  They've scared them away from making that move for now.
*18:14.160- 18:16.660* :  Do we know why the Israeli tanks have returned?
*18:17.700- 18:23.100* :  I mean, Israel's military has consistently said that it is going to continue its operations
*18:23.100- 18:25.300* :  probably for the rest of the year.
*18:25.720- 18:30.400* :  And that while it is bringing out many of its ground forces from deep within the Gaza
*18:30.400- 18:35.240* :  Strip, it is still going to continue with what it's indicated will be targeted operations
*18:35.260- 18:40.560* :  to try to release hostages and to go after Hamas leaders in particular.
*18:41.200- 18:45.040* :  But there must be some concern about the fact that Hamas is continuing to fire rockets
*18:45.040- 18:47.980* :  and Israel is still continuing to suffer casualties.
*18:49.040- 18:53.760* :  Indeed, and we still have Israeli ground forces in the heart of the Gaza Strip.
*18:53.800- 18:58.300* :  And as we said, like this battle is going on on the ground, so we hear almost daily
*18:58.300- 19:03.780* :  of one or two Israeli soldiers having been killed as a result, that is a main focus
*19:03.780- 19:06.060* :  of Israeli media attention.
*19:06.580- 19:11.060* :  But I think people would say that would be expected, given that at the moment it still
*19:11.060- 19:15.580* :  does remain a very intense situation, very heavy fighting going on in the south of the
*19:15.580- 19:16.300* :  Gaza Strip.
*19:16.540- 19:21.560* :  And you're land another focus of media attention has been the plight of the Israeli hostages.
*19:21.560- 19:26.060* :  And we've now got this deal which allows medicines to be sent in, but also crucially
*19:26.060- 19:27.920* :  needed aid for the Palestinians as well.
*19:28.240- 19:28.620* :  That's right.
*19:28.620- 19:31.780* :  We heard about this deal before and then we understood there were logistical problems
*19:31.780- 19:33.520* :  that held it up for the past few days.
*19:33.580- 19:39.060* :  It's been a main concern of hostage families, some of whom went to Doha, actually, and met
*19:39.060- 19:42.460* :  the Catery Prime Minister because Qatar is this important mediator here.
*19:42.880- 19:49.020* :  And now we've had both Qatar and Israel announcing that these medicines are to go in to Gaza.
*19:49.020- 19:53.500* :  This deal will also see a significant increase in medicines going in for Palestinian civilians.
*19:54.060- 19:57.740* :  And it's also being seen as another positive sign as we're hearing from the White House
*19:57.780- 20:02.740* :  that they're hopeful of another possible deal to release hostages, something a bigger
*20:02.740- 20:03.060* :  deal.
*20:03.940- 20:05.360* :  You're land now in Jerusalem.
*20:06.200- 20:10.360* :  When Poland elected a new government last year, the incoming Prime Minister Donald Tusk
*20:10.360- 20:15.800* :  promised major reforms to repair democracy in the country, restoring the rule of law,
*20:15.940- 20:20.940* :  the independence of the courts and ending what he called the factory of lies broadcast
*20:20.940- 20:22.200* :  by public media.
*20:22.940- 20:27.900* :  But his efforts so far have met fierce resistance from the former governing party now in
*20:28.460- 20:28.480* :  opposition.
*20:29.000- 20:33.880* :  Our correspondent Sarah Reinsford has been finding out how the battle for the airwaves has been
*20:38.440- 20:38.480* :  playing out.
*20:38.480- 20:43.620* :  There is a radical transformation underway at Polish public television, and it's not just
*20:43.620- 20:45.120* :  about building new studios.
*20:48.400- 20:54.640* :  TVP has a whole new team in place, with a mission to end eight years of propaganda, now there's
*20:54.640- 20:55.720* :  a new government here.
*20:59.020- 21:03.400* :  But when the news editor takes me on a tour, we pass a whole line of police officers in
*21:03.400- 21:04.080* :  the corridor.
*21:07.480- 21:10.980* :  There are more outside the news studio when we bump into the presenter.
*21:13.320- 21:16.000* :  You're reading the news, but you have like an armed police guard outside.
*21:16.660- 21:19.760* :  It's stressed and nervous here.
*21:20.660- 21:21.120* :  It's crazy.
*21:25.900- 21:28.920* :  That's because there is a fight over the airwaves here.
*21:31.960- 21:37.340* :  Last month the TVP studios were besieged by opposition MPs, angry that the new government
*21:37.340- 21:42.180* :  had sacked the management of public media and taken the main news channel off air.
*21:44.060- 21:48.900* :  The deputy prime minister Ksysztof Gowkowski agrees that was a radical step.
*21:48.900- 21:59.920* :  Do you accept that your methods to take control of the public media were not clean as
*21:59.920- 22:01.080* :  clean as they should have been?
*22:03.380- 22:04.560* :  We chose the right way.
*22:05.160- 22:06.480* :  There was no clean solution.
*22:07.280- 22:11.580* :  When I look at it today and I see how the opposition behaves, I see that the way we
*22:11.580- 22:14.640* :  chose what we're doing is very clean and responsible.
*22:22.160- 22:27.040* :  It's part of a broader power struggle here, kickback from the opposition that has now
*22:27.040- 22:28.500* :  lost a powerful tool.
*22:31.820- 22:34.160* :  Last week they fought a big crowd out in Warsaw.
*22:34.900- 22:39.960* :  The most of the chance were insults at Donald Tusk, painting the prime minister as a traitor.
*22:40.920- 22:44.200* :  That's the language they used to hear constantly on public television.
*22:44.200- 22:48.760* :  And it's why Mr Tusk's government has moved so fast to change things.
*22:53.900- 22:58.180* :  The next morning at TVP I found them covering that protest on the news.
*22:58.860- 23:05.220* :  The editor, Paweł Pluszka Tolbe, his aim is to be truly objective, not Donald Tusk television.
*23:05.880- 23:10.220* :  His other goal is to turn off the tap that once flowed with hate speech.
*23:11.060- 23:20.960* :  It's a big challenge, a big opportunity to make a new Polish television after eight years
*23:20.960- 23:22.860* :  of government propaganda.
*23:23.260- 23:28.500* :  Blanca Dugey is one of the new reporters, very committed to the cause, but she admits
*23:28.500- 23:29.800* :  it has been tough.
*23:30.380- 23:35.980* :  Blanca Dugey should go to Belarus, she's a swine, you're getting insults on social
*23:35.980- 23:36.340* :  media.
*23:36.540- 23:40.540* :  Yes, a lot of hatred, so it's emotionally difficult.
*23:44.060- 23:48.860* :  The flagship evening news bulletin has a new name now, as well as a new ethos.
*23:53.600- 24:00.780* :  In the gallery, beyond the police cordon, the countdown to air is a nervous moment, even
*24:00.780- 24:04.040* :  more so for this team, with so much to prove.
*24:13.300- 24:17.820* :  That report by Sarah Reinsford in Warsaw, and for more about the political power struggle
*24:17.820- 24:22.880* :  gripping Poland, you can search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*24:24.280- 24:29.900* :  The FBI has begun an investigation after the BBC revealed allegations of former chief executive
*24:29.900- 24:34.980* :  of Abercrombie and Fitch sexually exploited men at events he hosted around the world.
*24:35.500- 24:40.560* :  Mike Jeffries and his British partner also face a civil lawsuit alleging they ran a sex
*24:40.560- 24:41.640* :  trafficking operation.
*24:42.320- 24:46.560* :  Mr. Jeffries, who ran the US fashion company for two decades, has not commented.
*24:47.100- 24:50.340* :  Our investigation's correspondent, Rihanna Croxford, has more details.
*24:51.180- 24:56.520* :  In October, the BBC revealed allegations that Mike Jeffries had exploited young men for
*24:56.520- 24:59.280* :  sex while he was the retailer's chief executive.
*24:59.340- 25:03.860* :  At events he hosted in his residences in New York and at luxurious hotels.
*25:03.940- 25:09.600* :  Eight men, some of whom alleged they were abused, said these took place in cities including
*25:09.600- 25:13.740* :  London and Marrakesh between 2009 and 2015.
*25:14.580- 25:19.360* :  Documents such as flight tickets and emails revealed there was a highly organized operation
*25:20.000- 25:21.720* :  involving recruiters and a middleman.
*25:22.380- 25:28.120* :  Now, the BBC understands federal prosecutors and FBI agents in New York have been issuing
*25:28.120- 25:31.740* :  subpoenas and interviewing potential witnesses across the US.
*25:32.560- 25:38.000* :  It comes as Mr. Jeffries is already facing a civil lawsuit which accuses him of sex trafficking.
*25:38.960- 25:42.620* :  The FBI and the US attorney's office both declined to comment.
*25:43.280- 25:44.060* :  Rihanna Croxford
*25:45.120- 25:50.300* :  When Rebels seized the north of Ivory Coast in West Africa in 2002, they quickly turned
*25:50.300- 25:52.280* :  the city of Boakey into their capital.
*25:52.820- 25:55.920* :  It was subsequently bombed by the Ivorian Air Force.
*25:56.440- 26:00.820* :  In later years, when tensions reduced, Boakey became a symbol of reconciliation.
*26:01.120- 26:05.720* :  The National Football Team played matches there to show the country could reunite after
*26:05.720- 26:06.240* :  the conflict.
*26:06.860- 26:11.120* :  Now, Ivory Coast's second city is hosting games at the Africa Cup of Nations.
*26:11.860- 26:15.980* :  So what is Boakey like now, more than a decade after the end of the war?
*26:16.680- 26:22.800* :  James Coppnault went on a tour with Boakey resident Adeline Dree Quadio starting in her
*26:22.800- 26:25.900* :  favorite place, the Jack Acker Cultural Center.
*26:33.820- 26:41.680* :  I really like this place because there's a building here, which is a traditional beer.
*26:42.100- 26:44.400* :  A beer is a royal stool.
*26:44.600- 26:52.600* :  This is a great symbol of the Arkham people and this building is like a treasure for
*26:52.600- 26:52.880* :  me.
*26:53.780- 26:58.020* :  And like everything else, this place has been changed temporarily at least, I guess, by
*26:58.020- 26:59.400* :  the Africa Cup of Nations.
*26:59.400- 27:03.500* :  So this is a Quaba village, a welcome village, a fan zone.
*27:04.020- 27:09.100* :  I can see an inflatable elephant, a national symbol, in the colours of the Ivorian flag,
*27:09.100- 27:14.800* :  orange, white, green, inflatable Africa Cup of Nations trophy, lots of people holding
*27:15.440- 27:17.920* :  balloons in the shape of footballs.
*27:19.020- 27:23.720* :  This place, like so many other places, is coming alive with the football tournament.
*27:24.300- 27:31.480* :  Yes, when there's a match at the stadium, people come here to see the match and leave
*27:31.480- 27:36.260* :  the atmosphere of the stadium and it is great to be there in Boakey.
*27:37.800- 27:40.400* :  So we got back in the car, where are we heading to now?
*27:40.700- 27:42.240* :  To the Air France market.
*27:42.800- 27:50.840* :  It is the day of market today, so everybody come from the village around to sell what
*27:50.840- 27:51.420* :  they have.
*27:54.840- 27:59.660* :  We are in the food market, where you find everything you want to eat.
*28:00.120- 28:08.640* :  We see fish, plantains, herbs, hibiscus for juice, it's huge this place, isn't it?
*28:08.920- 28:10.040* :  Yes, it's huge.
*28:10.260- 28:13.240* :  Everybody is at its place.
*28:13.980- 28:20.720* :  They are building a new one for them to be a little more order, but this market was here
*28:20.720- 28:23.420* :  since I was a child.
*28:26.520- 28:32.180* :  Boakey has changed so much in the last 20 years, but here's a reminder of its past.
*28:32.880- 28:37.760* :  20 years ago during the Civil War, the building that I'm looking at was bombarded from the
*28:37.760- 28:42.780* :  air and it hasn't been repaired half of it blown away in essence.
*28:43.960- 28:47.100* :  This was an important building for the new forces rebels.
*28:48.400- 28:52.620* :  This is a reminder that this town has known Adeline some very difficult moments.
*28:53.100- 28:57.440* :  What was it like in 2002 when the war started, you were here, what was it like for you and
*28:57.440- 28:57.880* :  your family?
*28:58.180- 29:02.480* :  All we heard at this time was, this people we know, is that?
*29:02.940- 29:04.940* :  This people we know, is that so?
*29:04.940- 29:07.700* :  It was very difficult for us.
*29:12.260- 29:17.700* :  On the outskirts of Boakey, a weaver is giving some cotton, a very thorough wash, dye will
*29:17.700- 29:21.100* :  be added later and then the threads intricately woven together.
*29:21.680- 29:24.180* :  The end result is going to be a beautiful cloth.
*29:25.320- 29:29.600* :  So Adeline, tell us about the cloth we see, there's something people in this town, this area
