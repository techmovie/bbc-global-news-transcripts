*01:48.200- 01:51.280* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:53.220- 01:58.080* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Thursday, the 11th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:58.080- 02:03.980* :  The British Prime Minister has promised a new law to exonerate hundreds of post office managers
*02:04.240- 02:08.240* :  who are wrongly convicted as part of a huge miscarriage of justice.
*02:09.060- 02:14.320* :  The President of Ecuador has said that his country is at a state of war after deadly attacks,
*02:14.320- 02:20.780* :  kidnappings, and prison riots in recent days. An Austrian RS is choosing members of the
*02:20.820- 02:25.380* :  public to help it aside how to give away much of her multi-million dollar fortune.
*02:28.140- 02:28.900* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:32.760- 02:37.640* :  sperm whales have been found to live in distinctive plans, just like humans.
*02:37.720- 02:48.000* :  It's one of Britain's biggest miscarriages of justice. A scandal that stretches back 20 years
*02:48.000- 02:53.060* :  and has ruined the lives of hundreds of workers at the state-owned post office who were
*02:53.060- 02:59.380* :  wrongly prosecuted or convicted of theft and fraud, when actually the real problem was faulty
*02:59.380- 03:06.260* :  software from a system known as Horizon. More than 200 of the post office workers went to prison.
*03:07.000- 03:12.520* :  Many went bankrupt, lost their homes, saw their reputations trashed, and their marriages destroyed.
*03:13.440- 03:19.220* :  Some died without getting the chance to clear their names. At least four of them took their own lives.
*03:19.980- 03:23.100* :  These post office workers described their ordeal to the BBC.
*03:24.180- 03:30.860* :  Frankly, it wrecked my life, my family's life, and everybody I know is life.
*03:31.300- 03:35.980* :  I've carried the shame ever since I refused to carry it any longer.
*03:36.460- 03:42.060* :  I couldn't tell anybody of the truth. I was only my family and close friends what knew the actual
*03:42.060- 03:48.900* :  truth. I wasn't behind the post office counter and it took me a long, long time to talk about it.
*03:49.200- 03:53.200* :  I couldn't get a job for three and a half years after that. I couldn't afford to pay for my
*03:53.200- 04:00.600* :  daughter's school uniform. I suffered awful stigma and financial distress ever since.
*04:00.820- 04:05.820* :  The shortfall was found and I was told if I didn't repay it, I'd be facing a theft charge.
*04:06.420- 04:11.260* :  So I raided my savings, my parents' savings, had to sell my car. And as soon as that was done,
*04:11.660- 04:13.020* :  I was then charged with force accounting.
*04:14.320- 04:18.300* :  Yet despite the British government knowing about the problem for years, it's taken a recent
*04:18.300- 04:24.920* :  television drama and the subsequent public outrage to spur it into action. Just days after
*04:24.920- 04:29.640* :  its broadcast, the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, announced that Parliament would pass a bill to
*04:29.640- 04:35.120* :  quash all the convictions, the overwhelming majority of which have still not been overturned.
*04:35.480- 04:40.560* :  Today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those
*04:40.560- 04:46.380* :  convicted as a result of the horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.
*04:48.460- 04:52.500* :  I put it to our political correspondent Rob Watson that this unprecedented move by the
*04:52.500- 04:56.300* :  British government showed just how serious this scandal is.
*04:56.860- 05:01.860* :  This is politicians listening to the anger and my goodness is there a lot of anger out there.
*05:01.860- 05:07.400* :  Over nine million people watched this televised dramatisation and it was hard not to be utterly
*05:07.400- 05:13.520* :  gripped by the injustice suffered by these hundreds of poorly paid people whose lives were ruined.
*05:13.520- 05:18.720* :  So I think Rishi Sunak felt that it was probably better to do something rather nothing.
*05:18.720- 05:23.140* :  And of course what's being proposed is pretty radical because essentially politicians
*05:23.260- 05:30.040* :  rather than courts and judges and jurors will be deciding who was not guilty and of course they're
*05:30.040- 05:35.420* :  trying to put a sort of a rocket under the paying of compensation to these people and worth remembering
*05:35.420- 05:41.300* :  that for some of them really it's been over 20 years since they were able to clear their names,
*05:41.300- 05:44.740* :  their reputations and many of course were financially ruined.
*05:45.080- 05:48.000* :  And this is all begs the question, the government knew about this for years.
*05:48.000- 05:53.880* :  The post office workers had been exonerated in court so why was the process of compensating
*05:53.880- 06:00.540* :  them dragging on for so long so far what just 95 out of more than 900 convictions have been
*06:00.540- 06:06.340* :  overturned? What the claimants have said is just because it was so fantastically complicated that
*06:06.340- 06:12.720* :  the paperwork had been difficult and that they say that the post office remains a rather reluctant
*06:12.720- 06:18.700* :  partner in all of this despite having admitted that wrong was done. But of course what's really going
*06:18.700- 06:23.600* :  on here, why we've seen this movement, why there is this anger, is the television dramatization.
*06:23.780- 06:28.680* :  And I think it's really hit home for a couple of reasons despite the sort of facts of the case being
*06:28.680- 06:33.520* :  out there before as you say. I think one is because it all runs against incredibly strong
*06:33.940- 06:38.240* :  a sort of British sense of the need for fair play. The idea that these poor people have been
*06:38.240- 06:43.820* :  up against a mighty company like the post office that they hadn't got much of a deal from either
*06:43.820- 06:49.660* :  politicians, parliament, the courts or indeed the media. And I think it's also resonated because
*06:50.260- 06:57.540* :  I think it sort of chimes with a wider mood in this country of a sort of a sense of national decline
*06:57.540- 07:02.160* :  of national acquired. And actually a wider sense that's been around for some years that
*07:02.540- 07:07.140* :  things in this country just aren't working properly whether that's government, large companies,
*07:07.140- 07:12.100* :  the media, you name it. And so the anger is out there and the government felt forced to act.
*07:12.420- 07:15.340* :  Will anyone be held to account for this? That's what a lot of people are asking.
*07:15.760- 07:20.740* :  The short answer is we don't know but there are two processes still going on. So one is there's
*07:20.740- 07:25.820* :  this big public inquiry that's supposed to finish later this year. And that will be looking at
*07:26.200- 07:30.640* :  the role of senior executives in the post office and in the company Fujitsu that supplied
*07:30.640- 07:36.000* :  the IT. And there is also, it's important to remember, a police investigation going on to find out
*07:36.000- 07:41.380* :  whether these wrongful prosecutions of all these innocent people, you know, essentially involve
*07:41.380- 07:46.680* :  some form of fraud. But again, I think one of the reasons again why this is resonated with the
*07:46.680- 07:51.400* :  wider British public is that sort of sense of outrage that nobody these days, whether they're in
*07:51.400- 07:56.640* :  a senior position in a corporation or a politician or whatever, nobody ever takes the blame or accepts
*07:57.520- 08:01.920* :  responsibility or resign. So you know, it's the idea of the little guy against the big person,
*08:02.300- 08:05.360* :  the well-paid person, the state, and getting a raw deal.
*08:06.660- 08:10.820* :  Rob Watson, well, while some in Britain have welcomed what the government is doing,
*08:10.820- 08:16.100* :  others have expressed concern about the precedent this new legislation relating to the post office
*08:16.100- 08:22.040* :  scandal could set by, in effect, overriding the judicial process. Our home and legal affairs
*08:22.040- 08:28.060* :  correspondent Dominic Kashiani explores some of the key issues. The full wording of this
*08:28.060- 08:32.560* :  unprecedented plan won't be known for weeks, but some details are already clear.
*08:33.000- 08:37.180* :  The legislation will define the post office scandal convictions that will be overturned as soon
*08:37.180- 08:42.780* :  as it receives royal assent, but won't list the individuals. In practice, ministers have accepted
*08:42.780- 08:48.120* :  exonerating an unknown number of people who may be genuinely guilty. That's one of the reasons
*08:48.120- 08:53.260* :  why the plan has been greeted with some nervousness in the legal world. Not only does it quash
*08:53.260- 08:57.560* :  individual specific convictions without a public examination of the case for doing so,
*08:57.560- 09:02.300* :  as safeguard of British justice, critics say it tips the constitutional balance.
*09:02.300- 09:06.220* :  Lord McDonald is the former director of public prosecutions.
*09:06.700- 09:10.740* :  What we have is Parliament, if you like, seizing from the courts and the judges,
*09:11.140- 09:16.000* :  the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty. And the problem is that once this dam is
*09:16.000- 09:20.140* :  burst, I mean, we can all see it's been done for the best of reasons here. But once it's happened,
*09:20.140- 09:24.560* :  who's to say how such a process might be used in the future?
*09:24.980- 09:29.440* :  It's not clear yet how Scottish miscarriages will be handled under its entirely different criminal
*09:29.440- 09:34.960* :  law that also needs to be a separate plan for Northern Ireland. Ministers must also decide
*09:34.960- 09:39.300* :  what to do about a small number of appeals that have already been rejected.
*09:40.020- 09:45.080* :  They're however confident these challenges can be overcome because the exceptional nature of
*09:45.080- 09:51.600* :  this scandal requires an exceptional solution. Dominic Cassiani, the president of Ecuador,
*09:51.600- 09:57.200* :  Daniel Neboa, has said his country is at war with drugs gangs, even as dozens of prison guards
*09:57.200- 10:03.060* :  continue to be held hostage in jails across the country. Ecuadorians have been shocked by the
*10:03.060- 10:08.040* :  explosion of violence in the past few days, which began when a notorious gang leader escaped from
*10:08.040- 10:14.360* :  prison, and even resulted in a television studio in the city of Guayaquil being temporarily
*10:14.480- 10:18.360* :  taken over by government before they were eventually captured by police.
*10:19.220- 10:25.260* :  Esteban Torres Kobo, a vice minister in President Neboa's government, defended his decision to declare
*10:25.260- 10:35.980* :  war. President Neboa has declared a war against gangs, against drug cartels, and is hoping to get
*10:35.980- 10:42.600* :  real results. The last government did nothing. They actually did nothing. Government doesn't have the
*10:42.600- 10:49.400* :  control of all the prisons. That's why he's now doing this government, and what we see, this violence
*10:49.420- 10:57.600* :  is the response of these groups. But this is a war. This is a war. This is 800 million Ecuadorians
*10:58.080- 11:04.960* :  against 20,000 terrorists. So we are going to win this war. The people is united with the government.
*11:04.960- 11:11.100* :  The people is united with the police, with the military, and we're going to win this war.
*11:11.840- 11:16.540* :  Hundreds of soldiers are patrolling the streets of the capital Keto and other cities like Guayaquil,
*11:16.540- 11:21.360* :  which are largely deserted. Our correspondent Will Grant, who's in Guayaquil, told us what it's like
*11:22.720- 11:27.420* :  there. There's a real sense of sort of trepidation among those who are venturing out in Guayaquil
*11:27.420- 11:34.400* :  today. It was such a shock to see the anchor and journalists of state television being held hostage
*11:34.400- 11:38.980* :  with guns pointed to their heads, supposedly explosive device being brandished on television,
*11:39.000- 11:43.880* :  all of it being televised live. But that wasn't the only part of this sort of wave of violence.
*11:43.980- 11:48.880* :  There was also an attack on the city's university. There were bombs that were detonated,
*11:48.880- 11:55.680* :  not just in Guayaquil, but across Ecuador, and obviously in the wake of that schools of closed
*11:55.740- 12:03.160* :  businesses have shuttered, and hospitals are only treating emergency cases. The whole city
*12:03.160- 12:08.780* :  has been reduced to a minimal expression. We know that Ecuador has become increasingly violent
*12:08.780- 12:15.420* :  in recent years, but it seems that this latest flare-up of violence was sparked by the escape
*12:15.420- 12:21.520* :  from prison of a notorious gang leader. It certainly seems that that has a lot to do with it.
*12:21.520- 12:28.520* :  The boss of a group called the Chonero's gang, called Adolfo Macias Viamar, or Bernanona's Fito.
*12:29.180- 12:34.380* :  He escaped from prison over the weekend, just as he was about to be transferred to a higher
*12:34.380- 12:39.440* :  security wing. It does appear that there's the sort of wave of violence is related to that.
*12:39.440- 12:45.040* :  Now the Chonero's are a very powerful drug gang in Ecuador. They're believed to be behind the
*12:45.040- 12:50.360* :  murder of a presidential candidate last year. It is thought that they work with the
*12:50.360- 12:56.080* :  Sinaloa cartel from Mexico, a very powerful and important drug cartel, to ship smuggle
*12:56.340- 13:01.840* :  tons of cocaine out of Ecuador's port of which Guayaquil is the most important in the country
*13:01.900- 13:08.100* :  to the US and Europe. So, some combination of all of those factors is at play, including,
*13:08.100- 13:14.480* :  of course, the president, the new president, Daniel Nawaz, attempts to sort of squeeze the drug
*13:14.480- 13:20.980* :  gangs in prison. Fito was able to run his gang, essentially uninterrupted by authorities for many,
*13:20.980- 13:26.740* :  many years from behind bars. And the president came to office in November pledging to reduce
*13:26.740- 13:32.140* :  violence like this. What do you make of the way he's handling the situation? Well, he's spoken of
*13:32.140- 13:37.520* :  an internal armed conflict and there is a state of emergency in place for the next 60 days.
*13:38.040- 13:44.320* :  That is the strong-armed tactics, the iron fist that I think a lot of people in Ecuador actually
*13:44.320- 13:49.240* :  do want to see on some level. But I think there's a lot of skeptics in the country too who feel like
*13:49.260- 13:54.500* :  those kind of strategies have been used against crime and drug gangs in the past and have done
*13:54.500- 14:00.900* :  little to actually reduce the power of the gangs and are unsure at this stage that anything will
*14:00.900- 14:06.600* :  be genuinely different, that there will be no real wholesale reform of the prison system, for example,
*14:06.600- 14:11.680* :  except perhaps building some new penitentiaries. So, it's early days, he's just made these
*14:11.740- 14:16.220* :  announcements in the wake of the violence and we'll have to see, you know, how they play out in the
*14:16.220- 14:22.280* :  coming weeks and months. Will Grant in Ecuador? Reports from Somalia say that about eight passengers
*14:22.280- 14:28.080* :  and crew members of a UN helicopter are being held by Al Shabab militants. The UN supports an
*14:28.080- 14:32.900* :  African Union peacekeeping force which is helping the Somali army to fight Al Shabab.
*14:33.120- 14:38.660* :  Here's our African regional editor, Will Ross. The UN helicopter was carrying Somali and foreign
*14:38.660- 14:42.720* :  nationals when it landed in territory controlled by the jihadist group Al Shabab.
*14:42.720- 14:48.020* :  Quite why that happened is for now unclear and official with the army said it had developed a fault.
*14:48.020- 14:53.120* :  He said it was carrying medical supplies and was due to transport injured soldiers from Gal Gadur
*14:53.180- 14:58.100* :  region. There are unconfirmed reports that two passengers tried to flee the scene and one was
*14:58.100- 15:02.780* :  shot dead. The jihadist group has been under military pressure since President Hassan Sheikh
*15:02.780- 15:08.280* :  Muhammad launched an offensive last year, but it still controls large swathes of southern and
*15:08.280- 15:15.560* :  central Somalia. Will Ross, researchers have used ancient DNA to shed new light on why immune
*15:15.560- 15:20.960* :  diseases such as multiple sclerosis are twice as common in people from northern Europe compared
*15:20.960- 15:26.480* :  with the South. Experts from the Universities of Copenhagen, Cambridge and Oxford spent more than
*15:26.480- 15:31.760* :  10 years in the study published in Nature Journal. Our science correspondent, Philippe Roxby,
*15:31.760- 15:37.700* :  has been looking at the findings. Scientists have long been baffled by the fact that cases of MS
*15:37.700- 15:43.560* :  are twice as common in people in northwestern Europe compared with southern Europe. By analyzing
*15:43.560- 15:49.480* :  DNA from ancient bones and teeth and comparing it to modern-day genes, researchers have been
*15:49.480- 15:55.520* :  able to trace the disease back in time. Copenhagen, Cambridge and Oxford University experts
*15:55.520- 16:01.660* :  discovered that an nomadic people called the Yamnaya, who migrated west across Europe 5,000
*16:01.660- 16:07.920* :  years ago, introduced the MS risk gene. They were tall and strong and the gene was an advantage,
*16:07.920- 16:13.700* :  helping protect them against animal diseases. However, modern lifestyles have changed the focus
*16:13.700- 16:19.120* :  of our immune systems because we don't live as close to wild animals anymore. The researchers
*16:19.120- 16:25.360* :  say the genetic traits inherited from the Yamnaya now make northern Europeans more susceptible to
*16:25.360- 16:31.780* :  diseases where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it, like MS. Dr. William
*16:31.780- 16:37.500* :  Barry is an expert in ancient DNA analysis at the University of Cambridge and worked on the research.
*16:37.960- 16:42.520* :  Theoretically, we can apply these approaches, use this data to investigate the origins of
*16:42.660- 16:46.840* :  any disease with a genetic background. So, for example, schizophrenia, we look at where the

*17:11.020- 17:16.100* :  of the friars and people would be urging me to go home but I'd be thinking about power bills

*19:09.020- 19:10.700* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:11.200- 19:16.160* :  President Biden's son Hunter has made a surprise appearance in the U.S. House of Representatives
*19:16.160- 19:21.680* :  where Republicans are pushing to hold him in contempt of Congress. A committee wants him to give
*19:21.680- 19:27.080* :  evidence about business deals he conducted while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden has
*19:27.080- 19:32.080* :  said he'll only give evidence in public. Our North America editor, Sarah Smith, has more.
*19:32.880- 19:37.240* :  Hunter Biden's drove defiantly into the Congressional Committee hearing sitting in the front row
*19:37.660- 19:41.800* :  daring members to try to hold him in contempt for refusing to testify in front of them.
*19:41.800- 19:46.820* :  It was a dramatic political stunt that provoked an aggressive response from Republican members.
*19:46.860- 19:50.460* :  Representative Nancy Mayce said Mr. Biden should be arrested.
*19:50.960- 19:55.620* :  My first question is who bribed Hunter Biden to be here today. That's my first question.
*19:56.260- 20:01.740* :  Second question, you are the epitome of white privilege coming into the oversight committee,
*20:01.740- 20:07.580* :  spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed. What are you afraid of?
*20:07.580- 20:11.680* :  You have no balls to come up here. Mr. Chairman, point of inquiry.
*20:11.860- 20:17.100* :  We can hear from him right now, replied one of the Democrats on the committee, inciting an angry
*20:17.100- 20:21.480* :  debate between Republicans who are hoping to uncover evidence of corruption that they can connect
*20:21.480- 20:26.000* :  to President Biden and Democrats who say this is nothing more than an attempt to smear the
*20:26.000- 20:31.260* :  President using his son. There was belligerent grandstanding on display on both sides of this
*20:36.240- 20:39.980* :  argument today. Mr. Biden walked out after half an hour, accompanied by his lawyer, Abby Lul.
*20:39.980- 20:47.300* :  The Republican chairs today then are commandeering an unprecedented resolution to hold someone
*20:47.300- 20:52.340* :  in contempt, who is offered to publicly answer all their proper questions.
*20:53.140- 20:59.260* :  The question there is, what are they afraid of? Thank you. Hunter, why are you here today?
*21:01.140- 21:04.280* :  Hunter Biden was surrounded by reporters as he left, but said very little.
*21:04.600- 21:07.520* :  Clearly believing he had made his point, simply by turning up.
*21:08.460- 21:13.520* :  Sarah Smith, researchers found that sperm whales living clans with distinctive cultures,
*21:13.520- 21:19.660* :  much like we humans do. Scientists have now identified seven distinct clans of sperm whales in
*21:19.660- 21:25.180* :  the Pacific Ocean, each with its own morph code-like sequence of sounds used to communicate.
*21:25.860- 21:31.340* :  The researchers at Delhousie University in Halifax in Canada also found that the giant marine mammals
*21:31.740- 21:37.860* :  appear to engage in their own form of democracy. Our correspondent John Donnison dives into the story.
*21:42.160- 21:47.360* :  The clicks and clacks of a sperm whale, and as you might expect from the creature with the
*21:47.360- 21:52.260* :  biggest brain on the planet, their chit chat has more to it than meets the ear.
*21:52.980- 21:58.220* :  This latest research published in the Royal Society Open Science Journal found there are at least
*21:58.220- 22:04.520* :  seven separate clans of sperm whales in the Pacific Ocean, each with its own distinct culture
*22:11.580- 22:15.520* :  and vocal dialect. The study also showed the whales use their distinct dialects to communicate
*22:15.520- 22:22.660* :  and make democratic, consensual decisions about where to go, but it is a slow, messy process.
*22:23.220- 22:28.520* :  One example saw them take an hour and a half to decide whether or not to make a 90-degree turn.
*22:29.320- 22:35.700* :  How whitehead led the study? They live in these female-based groups, so with
*22:36.880- 22:44.500* :  great grand-mar, grand-mar daughters and a few young males. We were looking to see if there was
*22:44.500- 22:51.320* :  some kind of matriarch as you have with elephant soup kind of runs the show, but so far we haven't
*22:51.320- 22:57.080* :  found much evidence for that. It seems a much more democratic world. Researchers found the clans
*22:57.080- 23:03.900* :  comprised of up to 20,000 whales would sometimes meet, but almost never interbreed. They said in
*23:03.900- 23:10.160* :  human terms, their sense of identity was almost tribal, recognising they were different, but at the same
*23:10.160- 23:16.760* :  time, part of the same species. John Donnison, it sometimes happens that a school has to close
*23:16.760- 23:21.380* :  temporarily, but we wouldn't normally report on it. However, this school established in southern
*23:21.380- 23:27.220* :  England in the 15th century is not a normal one, and the reasons it's closed are a matter of
*23:27.220- 23:34.020* :  increasing concern. Paul Moff explains. It was once a ritual performed by the more aristocratic
*23:34.020- 23:39.620* :  members of British society. Upon the birth of a son, the boy would be christened, he'd be
*23:39.620- 23:45.320* :  formally welcomed into the family, and then his parents would write a letter, requesting that at
*23:45.320- 23:52.500* :  the age of 13, their son would be admitted as a pupil at Eton. Times have changed, nowadays you
*23:52.500- 23:58.220* :  pass an exam to get into Eton, but it remains Britain's most famous school. It's certainly one of
*23:58.220- 24:05.420* :  the most expensive, costing the equivalent of $60,000 a year. But more than that, Eton is perhaps
*24:05.420- 24:11.400* :  the country's most influential educational establishment for ambitious youngsters. 20 British
*24:11.400- 24:17.220* :  prime ministers went to Eton, including Boris Johnson. So too did Prince William and Prince Harry,
*24:17.780- 24:22.920* :  and the fictional James Bond went there, though he was expelled for seducing one of the maids.
*24:23.480- 24:28.640* :  Eton today has facilities that would put a luxury resort to shame, whether they're for sport,
*24:28.640- 24:35.600* :  music, or putting on plays. So parents who forked out the cash for all this lavish learning
*24:36.200- 24:40.740* :  were presumably not happy to be told that the beginning of this term would be delayed.
*24:41.520- 24:47.440* :  And for a decidedly down-to-earth reason, heavy rain has swelled the nearby river Thames,
*24:47.880- 24:54.020* :  and not to put too fine a point on it, sewage has backed up and is now overrunning the Eton
*24:54.020- 25:00.020* :  toilets. It's out of the question for young privileged rumps to be sat in such distressing
*25:00.020- 25:06.480* :  conditions, and so the boys have been told to work from home until the problem can be rectified.
*25:07.140- 25:11.960* :  Sewage has become a serious political issue in Britain. Many blame private water companies
*25:11.960- 25:17.820* :  for failing to build the right infrastructure to control it. Now it seems Britain's most famous
*25:17.820- 25:21.200* :  private school is paying the price. Paul Moss
*25:22.280- 25:26.640* :  Next to Austria, where an era is setting up a group of citizens to decide how to give away
*25:26.640- 25:32.580* :  much of her fortune, Marlena Engelhorn, who lives in Vienna, has sent out invitations to 10,000
*25:32.580- 25:37.860* :  members of the public. 50 will be chosen to help work out how more than 21 million dollars
*25:37.860- 25:45.200* :  should be redistributed. Bethany Bell reports. Marlena Engelhorn is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn,
*25:45.200- 25:52.820* :  the founder of the German Chemical and Pharmaceutical Company, BASF. She inherited millions when her
*25:52.820- 26:00.260* :  grandmother died. Austria abolished inheritance tax in 2008, and Miss Engelhorn believes that is
*26:00.260- 26:07.260* :  unfair. She is setting up a group of 50 Austrians to attend a series of meetings in Salzburg to
*26:07.260- 26:15.400* :  decide how to redistribute her fortune. They'll be paid 1,200 euros to attend six weekend meetings,
*26:15.420- 26:22.100* :  and would be supported by academics and other specialists. Miss Engelhorn will have no right to
*26:22.100- 26:28.000* :  veto the group's final decision. According to the initiative's website, if the group can't come
*26:28.000- 26:33.400* :  up with a widely-supported decision on what to do with the money, then it will go back to Miss Engelhorn.
*26:34.220- 26:40.060* :  Bethany Bell, now another uplifting story. In more than two decades as a cook for a Burger King
*26:40.060- 26:46.560* :  restaurant and airport in Las Vegas, Kevin Ford has never missed a shift, and his hard work has gone
*26:46.560- 26:51.540* :  viral after his sister set up a fundraising campaign to recognise his years of service.
*26:52.360- 27:00.060* :  Kevin's been able to buy a home with a proceeds since then, more than $450,000 raised so far,
*27:00.680- 27:07.940* :  but despite his internet fame, he's kept doing what he loves most, working hard in the kitchen at Burger King.
*27:08.660- 27:12.360* :  James Reynolds caught up with Kevin and asked him what keeps him going.
*27:13.300- 27:19.300* :  When I think about providing for my kids and just doing what I have to do, pay my bills,
*27:19.660- 27:25.620* :  that's always kept me going. It's obviously 27 years without missing a day, but it's not 27 years
*27:25.620- 27:30.240* :  in perfect health. How did you get to work on days when you were feeling ill? What propelled you?
*27:30.480- 27:39.820* :  Other than the Lord, I guess it was just trying to just stay healthy and possible. I would be at work
*27:39.820- 27:45.240* :  at times with back pains laying on the floor in front of the friars, and people would be urging
*27:45.240- 27:51.300* :  me to go home, but I'd be thinking about power bills or keeping health insurance for my kids, so
*27:53.020- 27:58.040* :  I really don't have an answer for that. I just never really thought about misses in a day,
*27:58.040- 28:02.800* :  and I just always pushed through. Your family, as they saw your dedication to your work,
*28:02.800- 28:09.060* :  what would they say to you about what you were teaching them? My daughters all knew my dad,
*28:09.360- 28:16.880* :  now I knew my mom. My mom, they're both passed on now, but that was their grandparents, and they
*28:16.880- 28:25.140* :  seen that my mom raised seven kids, and my dad was in the Air Force. This is the reason we were
*28:25.140- 28:29.740* :  even out here because he was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base, and they would really just know
*28:29.740- 28:34.160* :  it was bread in my blood to work hard and to provide for a family.
*28:34.820- 28:42.960* :  And you got to 27 years at work. Describe the job you do at Burger King and the hours that you
*28:42.960- 28:48.680* :  work in that job. Back in the day, we used to work for 10 hours shifts, but now it's 8 hours shifts,
*28:48.680- 28:56.260* :  and you come in, you do front and back, depending upon where you're assigned to, but once they kind
*28:56.260- 29:02.940* :  of know what you're good at or what you like, they kind of leave you. If you're up front, you
*29:03.200- 29:11.020* :  take orders, you constantly cleaning, constantly stalking, handing out orders, tons, and tons of
*29:11.020- 29:15.920* :  order, because we're in, used to be McCaring Airport now, it's Harry Reid Airport. We're one of
*29:15.920- 29:21.380* :  the busiest cooking and cleaning, you're just cooking clean from the time you come in and watch
*29:21.380- 29:26.820* :  the dishes. You're making burgers, you're making fries, and it's hot. You know, it's Vegas, so.
*29:27.360- 29:31.760* :  Have you ever calculated how many burgers, how many fries you might have made over the years?
*29:33.640- 29:40.360* :  Now, my head would explode, literally explode. I have to think about that even in a day,
*29:41.060- 29:49.100* :  but it's amazing that we, I tell the crew all the time, you know, sometimes we have great
*29:49.100- 29:55.080* :  managers, but sometimes they don't tell you how good a job you do, so I tell people because
*29:55.360- 29:59.100* :  you're around these people more than you're around your own family. When you got to 27 years,
*30:00.660- 30:04.840* :  there was a small goodie bag given to you. Who gave that to you?
*30:05.020- 30:11.860* :  It was a manager's, but the day before, a couple days before that, I was like goofing off,
*30:11.860- 30:16.660* :  like, you know, making everybody laugh, and somebody had went by, I was washing dishes,
*30:16.660- 30:22.780* :  like I'm always doing, and I said, this is the prize I get. I have to wash these dishes for my
*30:22.780- 30:28.820* :  27-year anniversary, and it was a manager named Sherry. She's awesome. She ran next door.
*30:28.820- 30:33.900* :  She got me a piece of chocolate cake, and you know, I said, have the anniversary, and I love
*30:33.900- 30:40.860* :  that cake. I ate that cake, and I guess she got word to HR or something that it was my 27-year
*30:41.160- 30:48.220* :  excuse. And like the next day, a couple more managers presented me with that bag. I don't think
*30:48.220- 30:53.720* :  they put it together, but they were told like from upper management or somebody to give me that
*30:53.720- 30:58.440* :  bag. Your daughter Serena said you continue to work at Bo King because the amazing health
*30:58.440- 31:04.720* :  insurance that's been provided through your employer, but also she wanted to tell the world
*31:04.720- 31:09.420* :  a bit about you. And the fact that you never missed a day's work and set up the GoFundMe page,
*31:09.420- 31:16.080* :  and that's begun to change your life a bit, I guess. She just wanted to get $200 so I could go
*31:16.080- 31:23.480* :  out there and see my grandkids for the plane ticket. And yeah, it blew up, and it continues to blow
*31:23.480- 31:30.800* :  up, I guess people keep wanting to tip me, and they see something in me that even I can't even see
*31:30.800- 31:36.900* :  it myself at times. So it's a beautiful thing. It's absolutely changed my life in the lives of my
*31:36.900- 31:41.920* :  children and my grand children forever. You've been able to buy your first home with the proceeds?
*31:42.520- 31:48.300* :  Yeah. I've been able to do a lot of things by renting a house, and rent was so high that when I
*31:48.300- 31:54.680* :  got off work, I would drive Uber Eats and DoorDash for like four hours, and then on my days off,
*31:54.680- 32:01.220* :  I would do those for 16 to 20 hours just to pay my bills, put money up for my retirement,
*32:01.220- 32:07.160* :  and for my kids, and then yes, I just purchased the house, and I'm in it right now, but I would not
*32:07.160- 32:14.520* :  own video because it's a mess. We wouldn't mind. We wouldn't mind. It boxes everywhere, man.
*32:16.800- 32:21.240* :  And Kevin, do you still work at doing your shifts at Burger King?
*32:22.700- 32:30.340* :  Yeah, I still work. I'm 56, but I feel strong and everything, and I think I'm going to go either,
*32:30.740- 32:36.680* :  I want to get to you to 30 years or 35, and you know, even think about retiring. But while I'm
*32:36.680- 32:41.200* :  young, I still feel young and everything, I'm just going to keep working.
*32:42.420- 32:47.160* :  Kevin Ford, who has never missed a day of work in 27 years of making burgers.
*32:50.100- 32:54.260* :  Now that's all for us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
