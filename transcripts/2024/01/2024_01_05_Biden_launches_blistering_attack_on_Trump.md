*00:00.140- 00:03.240* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.360- 00:08.720* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Saturday,
*00:08.720- 00:14.280* :  the 6th of January. The US President Joe Biden kicks off America's election year with an attack
*00:14.280- 00:18.960* :  on Donald Trump. Today, we're here to answer the most important of questions.
*00:19.940- 00:23.800* :  Is democracy still America's sacred cause?
*00:25.620- 00:30.760* :  Hezbollah says it has to respond to the assassination of a Hamas leader in its stronghold in Lebanon
*00:30.760- 00:37.020* :  or face more Israeli attacks. And those people who spoke freely, they were arrested,
*00:37.020- 00:41.140* :  they were beaten, they were tortured, some of them were killed in the jail.
*00:41.700- 00:45.240* :  We report on an opposition crackdown ahead of Bangladesh's election.
*00:47.720- 00:52.200* :  Also in the podcast, move over Hollywood, make way for Norleywood.
*00:52.740- 00:56.380* :  In the cinema, I watched it. Everyone who saw the movie was up on their feet,
*00:56.400- 00:58.960* :  clapping for the producer of the movie.
*00:58.960- 01:04.560* :  The Nigerian film that's storming the box office. And we hear which band has won the BBC's
*01:04.560- 01:06.620* :  prestigious Sound of 2024.
*01:11.580- 01:16.800* :  The US President Joe Biden has kicked off America's election year with a forceful attack on his
*01:16.800- 01:21.440* :  likely rival, Donald Trump. Speaking in Pennsylvania near Valley Forge,
*01:21.440- 01:25.240* :  the site where George Washington regrouped his forces during the war of independence,
*01:25.240- 01:30.380* :  President Biden highlighted Mr. Trump's actions on the 6th of January 2021
*01:30.900- 01:32.700* :  when his supporters stormed the US Capitol.
*01:33.240- 01:36.020* :  Today, we're here to answer the most important of questions.
*01:36.500- 01:40.340* :  Is democracy still America's sacred cause?
*01:42.380- 01:42.820* :  I mean it.
*01:46.140- 01:51.960* :  A choice is clear. Donald Trump's campaign is about him, not America, not you.
*01:52.600- 01:54.520* :  He's only the sacrifice of our democracy.
*01:54.980- 01:57.780* :  Put himself in power. Our campaign is different.
*01:58.480- 02:02.520* :  Mr. Biden also accused his predecessor of using language reminiscent of
*02:02.640- 02:04.280* :  Adolf Hitler's Nazi party.
*02:04.860- 02:09.120* :  With former AIDS, Trump plans to invoke the Insurrection Act,
*02:09.580- 02:12.220* :  which will allow him to deploy, which is not allowed to do an ordinary service.
*02:12.580- 02:16.640* :  US military forces on the streets of America said it.
*02:17.120- 02:19.540* :  He calls those who are proposing vermin.
*02:20.340- 02:23.040* :  He talks about the blood of America being poisoned.
*02:23.860- 02:27.780* :  That going the same exact language used in Nazi Germany.
*02:28.560- 02:32.480* :  Well ahead of the speech, the Trump campaign released an advert accusing Mr. Biden
*02:32.480- 02:35.040* :  of being the true destroyer of democracy.
*02:35.640- 02:38.900* :  For an assessment of what Mr. Biden had to say, I spoke to our correspondent
*02:38.900- 02:40.540* :  in Washington, Will Vernon.
*02:41.140- 02:43.480* :  Well, this speech was all about Donald Trump, wasn't it?
*02:43.480- 02:48.500* :  There was absolutely no mention whatsoever of what Joe Biden would do if he's elected.
*02:48.500- 02:52.720* :  I think this was a clear attempt to shift the focus of his campaign.
*02:52.720- 02:55.660* :  Last year, Biden was all about bi-denomics, right?
*02:55.660- 02:59.820* :  The campaign were talking about the economic achievements under his administration,
*02:59.900- 03:02.940* :  but that hasn't appeared to work for the president.
*03:02.940- 03:04.640* :  You know, his poll numbers are not good.
*03:05.120- 03:07.060* :  And I think now the decision has been made.
*03:07.060- 03:10.620* :  It appears that way at least that this campaign now,
*03:10.620- 03:14.860* :  the narrative should be more about not a referendum on the Biden administration,
*03:14.980- 03:20.220* :  but more a kind of mission to stop Trump assuming, of course, he is the candidate.
*03:20.460- 03:24.920* :  So Mr. Biden today portrayed Mr. Trump as a clear threat to democracy,
*03:24.960- 03:27.800* :  which he said is America's sacred cause.
*03:28.120- 03:31.780* :  And he claimed the events of January the 6th, exactly three years ago,
*03:31.780- 03:35.440* :  when that violent mob of Mr. Trump supporters attacked Congress.
*03:35.440- 03:40.240* :  Those events showed that Mr. Trump was willing to sacrifice democracy for power.
*03:40.480- 03:44.120* :  Will this new strategy from the Biden campaign work?
*03:44.260- 03:45.940* :  Will it win over the doubters?
*03:46.420- 03:48.580* :  Well, he's got a difficult task ahead of him.
*03:48.580- 03:52.960* :  Almost every poll you look at sounds like bad news for Mr. Biden.
*03:52.960- 03:57.240* :  You know, his approval rating is around 37 to 40 percent.
*03:57.240- 04:02.080* :  Analysts say that is the lowest of any president at this stage of his presidency.
*04:02.120- 04:06.260* :  56 percent of people don't want Mr. Biden to be the nominee.
*04:06.260- 04:09.040* :  Although it's true, they don't want Trump either.
*04:09.180- 04:12.940* :  And 70 percent of people say that he's too old to be president.
*04:12.940- 04:17.260* :  But many analysts at this stage say these polls don't really mean much.
*04:17.260- 04:19.380* :  10 months away from the election.
*04:19.560- 04:22.760* :  And I think the Biden campaign are hoping that when it comes to November,
*04:22.760- 04:26.700* :  and people are presented with a stark choice in front of their eyes,
*04:26.700- 04:30.340* :  either Joe Biden or Donald Trump, the man who faces
*04:30.840- 04:35.340* :  91 criminal charges who attempted to overturn the results of a legitimate election.
*04:35.340- 04:39.240* :  I think they're hoping that at that point, people will decide to vote for Joe Biden.
*04:39.940- 04:41.220* :  Will Vernon in Washington?
*04:42.220- 04:44.880* :  After staying relatively quiet for the best part of two months,
*04:44.880- 04:48.540* :  Hassan Nazralla has now spoken out twice in a matter of days.
*04:49.300- 04:53.300* :  Once again, the Hezbollah chief threatens to retaliate against Israel
*04:53.300- 04:57.340* :  for its suspected role in the assassination of a Hamas leader based in Lebanon.
*04:57.340- 05:02.160* :  Salah al-Rouhri died in a drone strike in Hezbollah's stronghold of South Beirut.
*05:02.720- 05:04.860* :  Hassan Nazralla said that over the past two months,
*05:04.860- 05:08.500* :  Hezbollah had carried out 670 attacks on Israel,
*05:09.120- 05:11.060* :  and he hinted there would be more to come.
*05:14.600- 05:18.480* :  As for Southern Beirut, I say this will not pass without a response,
*05:19.060- 05:20.480* :  nor without a punishment.
*05:21.400- 05:23.040* :  Our reaction will surely come.
*05:23.040- 05:27.320* :  We cannot say silent on the violation of this level of danger,
*05:27.760- 05:31.680* :  because this would mean all of Lebanon would be exposed.
*05:32.540- 05:37.760* :  Backed by Iran, Hezbollah has in the past posed a serious military threat to Israel,
*05:37.760- 05:41.520* :  even forcing it to end its 15-year occupation of South Lebanon.
*05:42.140- 05:44.280* :  The border area remains disputed, though,
*05:44.280- 05:48.740* :  and Hassan Nazralla said he hoped Lebanon could eventually get some of its land back.
*05:49.280- 05:52.920* :  For an assessment of this later speech, I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*05:52.920- 05:53.760* :  Shah-e-Mahalil.
*05:54.060- 05:58.480* :  His defined, he again wants to appear to his following that Hezbollah hasn't taken
*05:58.480- 06:04.560* :  its eye off the ball in terms of retaliation to the killing of Salah al-Rouhri at the heart of
*06:04.600- 06:06.480* :  the Hezbollah stronghold.
*06:06.480- 06:11.660* :  He said that the attacks continue in Lebanon's southern border, in Israel's northern border.
*06:11.660- 06:17.220* :  He did hint to a long-term goal, if you will, that the war in Gaza and the resistance in Gaza
*06:17.220- 06:22.340* :  is going to give Hezbollah a chance to liberate some of Lebanon's borders.
*06:22.340- 06:28.580* :  I reckon that's a long way off, but still I think restraining himself and Hezbollah from going
*06:28.580- 06:30.840* :  on an all-out conflict with Israel.
*06:31.100- 06:36.240* :  The international community keen to prevent an escalation, we're seeing the US Secretary of State
*06:36.240- 06:41.480* :  heading to the region, the EU High Representative of Foreign Affairs, Jew in Lebanon too.
*06:41.480- 06:47.100* :  At the same time, in Gaza where there have been calls from various international players
*06:47.100- 06:52.120* :  for Israel to calm things down, we're still seeing a high rate of fire.
*06:52.120- 06:53.140* :  What is happening there?
*06:53.400- 06:59.100* :  Not only have we seen calls from the international community for a scaled-down offensive in Gaza,
*06:59.300- 07:03.460* :  we've also heard the military a week ago saying that they were going to withdraw troops,
*07:03.460- 07:09.580* :  withdraw reservists that has not translated what you're seeing is a sustained bombardment
*07:09.580- 07:14.820* :  and a sustained ground operation, whether it's in central Gaza or southern Gaza,
*07:14.820- 07:20.640* :  and in central Gaza again to remind our listeners, the Israeli army has demanded that people
*07:20.640- 07:25.200* :  in the center, it's a strip of land that goes across central Gaza and affects three
*07:25.200- 07:29.560* :  densely populated refugee camps, and there has been sustained bombardment there.
*07:29.560- 07:34.980* :  There's one hospital, a oxa hospital, that caters for all of the casualties that come in,
*07:35.080- 07:37.260* :  and that has been extremely overwhelmed.
*07:37.260- 07:42.260* :  So as this goes on, the safer areas for people to go become much, much smaller,
*07:42.260- 07:47.180* :  but also the humanitarian aid then becomes very difficult because it's not just about delivery,
*07:47.180- 07:53.300* :  but also the fact that it has to travel a long and very treacherous road to get to the people who
*07:53.300- 07:53.800* :  need it.
*07:54.080- 07:55.840* :  Shai Mahaleel in Jerusalem
*07:56.760- 08:04.620* :  The Hamas run Health Ministry says 162 Palestinians died in Gaza in the most recent 24-hour period.
*08:05.260- 08:09.200* :  Israel says another of the hostages held in the territory has been declared dead,
*08:09.200- 08:15.400* :  bringing the total to 25. Some of the captives seized by Hamas on the 7th of October were taken
*08:15.400- 08:21.100* :  from the Nover Music Festival. A number of survivors of that atrocity and relatives of those killed
*08:21.100- 08:26.420* :  or abducted have recently been back to the scene. Our correspondent We're a Davis was with them.
*08:28.720- 08:34.060* :  This is the site of the Nover Music Festival, just before half past six on the morning of
*08:34.060- 08:41.480* :  October the 7th. Hamas gunmen streamed across the border from Gaza and attacked people enjoying
*08:41.480- 08:48.600* :  the music, enjoying being young. Almost 400 people were killed at this site, around 40 abducted
*08:48.600- 08:54.560* :  to Gaza where they remain. Everything has gone from this site, but that doesn't mean that what
*08:54.560- 08:56.560* :  happened here has been forgotten.
*08:56.880- 09:05.060* :  Don't turn your back on my sister and on another 135 that needs the World Health.
*09:05.340- 09:11.020* :  Today, several survivors and relatives of the missing came back to give their personal testimony.
*09:11.860- 09:16.780* :  As soon as I got out of there, I learned that the hostage video of my brother was already released
*09:16.780- 09:22.180* :  by Hamas. However, since then, my family lives have turned into a living hell.
*09:22.640- 09:29.100* :  There's almost nothing left here at the festival site. Apart from hundreds of images of those
*09:29.100- 09:36.240* :  people who were killed, among them is enough levy. A husband or is being held captive by Hamas
*09:36.300- 09:41.720* :  in Gaza and today is the first day that his brother Michael has come back to the site.
*09:42.180- 09:49.120* :  It wasn't easy to stand here and look at the ground and see the bullets and see if faces
*09:49.120- 09:53.980* :  and they need to bring them back as soon as possible. We all can do more.
*09:54.300- 10:00.400* :  Much of the world's attention is still focused on the ongoing war in Gaza where more than 22,000
*10:00.400- 10:05.720* :  people, many of them civilians have been killed, but Israel doesn't want the world to forget what
*10:05.720- 10:09.440* :  happened in places like this on October the 7th.
*10:13.220- 10:19.640* :  This is quite a remarkable exhibition in Tel Aviv. It's the Nova Exhibition. It's a faithful
*10:19.640- 10:26.140* :  reproduction of the party site on the border with Gaza which was attacked by Hamas on October
*10:26.140- 10:32.640* :  the 7th. Everything that is here has been brought back from that festival site. There are tents,
*10:32.680- 10:38.400* :  there are sleeping bags, there are cars in which people tried to escape and in which many people
*10:38.400- 10:44.400* :  were murdered. There are photographs, there are art exhibitions. So my name is Tal Shimonium 25
*10:45.240- 10:49.060* :  and my role in the party was one of the team leaders in the Econova project.
*10:52.940- 10:56.920* :  She people don't understand how our life looked a minute before and look at how colorful
*10:56.920- 11:02.060* :  these places. We were in one of the peaks of the moments of our life. We were so happy to dance
*11:02.060- 11:09.340* :  in our community. The gap between joyful moments and friendship moments and love to horrors and fear
*11:09.340- 11:19.440* :  is huge. One of the most poignant exhibits here is the bar. Drinks, ash trays, a till with bullet holes
*11:19.440- 11:27.420* :  in it and most poignantly six or seven fridges in which people try to hide. Hamas fighters
*11:27.420- 11:33.800* :  open the fridge doors and shot people as they hit inside the fridges. Many bodies were found
*11:33.800- 11:42.480* :  between the fridges. This was a scene of utter carnage on October the 7th and many of the things
*11:42.480- 11:48.060* :  associated with that day have been brought back here to this exhibition centre in Tel Aviv
*11:48.760- 11:55.140* :  so that people don't forget and people do remember. We're at Davis reporting from Israel.
*11:56.160- 12:01.780* :  The Belgorod region of Russia bordering Ukraine says it has started moving families away from
*12:01.780- 12:07.000* :  the area as the Ukrainian military steps up cross-border bombardments more from our Europe reporter
*12:07.000- 12:11.340* :  Sasha Schickler. Belgorod lies just northeast of Ukraine's second city
*12:11.340- 12:17.280* :  Harkiv so no wonder it's born the brunt of Ukraine's retaliation with almost daily drone and
*12:17.280- 12:22.440* :  mortar attacks. Yet to read government Gratkov's telegram channel you'd think is just some
*12:22.440- 12:29.340* :  ragtang gang causing a nuisance. He never used the word war but last weekend Belgorod came
*12:29.340- 12:36.300* :  under the most intense barrage which killed 25 people. Today Mr. Gratkov advised residents to
*12:36.300- 12:42.220* :  sell a tape their windows but even better avail themselves of an offer of a comfortable bus ride
*12:42.220- 12:48.120* :  to two outlying towns where they will get free food and lodging. He will stay there for as long
*12:48.120- 12:53.680* :  as necessary he added. Reading between the lines this means the governor is admitting that the
*12:53.680- 13:01.520* :  situation will not change anytime soon. Sasha Schickler. A Nigerian film has broken box office
*13:01.520- 13:06.720* :  records by becoming the first locally produced movie to earn more than a million dollars there.
*13:06.720- 13:11.940* :  A tribe called Judah is about five brothers plotting a heist to get money to help their
*13:11.940- 13:27.700* :  ailing mother. The film was created by the Nigerian actor director and producer Funka Akindale,
*13:27.700- 13:31.900* :  a reporter in Lagos, Yusuf Akin-Pelu, told me more about it.
*13:32.320- 13:38.580* :  It is a story that coincided with survival instinct with the everyday struggle of a single
*13:38.580- 13:44.620* :  mother. The everyday struggle of an average Nigerian on how to meet their health insurance,
*13:44.620- 13:49.620* :  their health obligation and how people struggle to survive. It is something that we call in
*13:49.820- 13:54.920* :  local balance to say the cast understood their summit and they all delivered and it was amazing.
*13:54.920- 13:59.820* :  Even at the end of the movie in the cinema I watched it. Everyone who saw the movie was up on
*13:59.820- 14:06.080* :  their feet clapping for the producer of the movie. And has that surprised people or looking at the
*14:06.180- 14:09.860* :  plot and the stars. Did people think actually this one could do quite well?
*14:10.180- 14:16.320* :  When the producer was asked this question prior to its premiere three weeks ago from Kakindale,
*14:16.320- 14:21.080* :  she said what she expected is she said she believed it would do the numbers and it would be a
*14:21.080- 14:25.460* :  block box that and it's been coming for the past three years or so she's been releasing movies
*14:25.460- 14:30.200* :  at the end of the year which would be very great movies that would break box office records.
*14:30.220- 14:37.580* :  And expected to overtake Black Panther Wakanda forever a Hollywood blockbuster of course.
*14:37.580- 14:40.900* :  What does this mean for the Nigerian film industry?
*14:40.900- 14:46.860* :  That means the Nigerian story tellers have come to stay. People should watch out for Nigerians
*14:46.860- 14:51.880* :  to tell us. Not just this movie there's been a lot of movies that were released that were amazing.
*14:51.880- 14:57.260* :  The lights of Black Book, which was released on Netflix and the lights of Breath of Life and a
*14:57.260- 15:02.100* :  couple of other movies like that that's just to show you the amount of talent in terms of storytelling
*15:02.100- 15:06.980* :  that is in this country. And as we like to say among ourselves here one of the biggest
*15:06.980- 15:12.260* :  exports of Nigeria is its entertainment with music and its movies. They are not just coming
*15:12.260- 15:15.900* :  to the table but they're rather bringing their own cheers to the table.
*15:16.340- 15:23.420* :  Yusuf Fakim Polo in Lagos. David Sol, Hartford Obstar of one of the biggest TV shows of the 1970s,
*15:23.680- 15:29.200* :  has died at the age of 80. He was best known for playing Detective Kenneth Hutchinson in
*15:29.200- 15:34.260* :  Starski and Hutch. But as David Solito reports, acting wasn't his first love.
*15:40.740- 15:47.300* :  David Sol and don't give up on his baby. 1977 was the year for David Solberg.
*15:51.520- 15:56.440* :  The blonde, blue-eyed son of a Lutheran pastor from South Dakota, two number ones,
*15:56.440- 16:03.500* :  the star of one of the bigger shows on TV. He had made his name with Hutch in Starski and Hutch
*16:03.740- 16:09.460* :  under cover cops who relied on frequent car chases, the all-knowing Huggie Bear to fight crime.
*16:09.760- 16:12.440* :  What was the name of that friend of yours? Sneaky Pete. Sneaky Pete.
*16:12.580- 16:17.960* :  Every now and again, he'd find a reason to sing. David Sol had long wanted to be known for his
*16:17.960- 16:25.520* :  voice more than his looks, which is why his music career began with this. I am the covered man.
*16:27.180- 16:32.880* :  I started doing some concert work and had a gimmick where I put a bag over my head and
*16:32.880- 16:37.380* :  call myself the covered man. And I never let anybody see what I looked like. I refused to take
*16:44.740- 16:49.100* :  the mask off. But he had more success acting, appearing here as a malevolent policeman with
*16:49.100- 16:59.840* :  Clint Eastwood and Magnum Force. However, by the end of the 70s he was keen to escape from
*16:59.840- 17:05.300* :  Hutch and the attendant fame. He ended up moving to the UK, appearing in Holby City,
*17:05.300- 17:10.300* :  Jerry Springer the Opera and Little Britain. Along the way, there were five marriages,
*17:10.300- 17:17.340* :  a drink problem, even a short spell in jail. But for a certain generation, David Sol would always
*17:17.340- 17:21.340* :  be the blonde singing superstar of his 70s hater.
*17:21.460- 17:29.460* :  Come on to the lady, take my word, I won't run out on you again, believe me,
*17:31.400- 17:35.080* :  David Solito on David Sol, who's died at the age of 80.
*17:37.980- 17:43.340* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. We'd like recover something from what he had left in
*17:43.340- 17:49.920* :  the yard and say, oh my gosh, we have a six for the serial number. After a very expensive dog's dinner,
*17:49.920- 17:52.920* :  how the owners managed to get some of their money back.
*18:02.300- 18:07.300* :  At least four people have been killed and many others injured in a fire on a moving train in
*18:07.300- 18:12.220* :  Bangladesh, with the police saying they suspect an arson attack ahead of the election on Sunday.
*18:12.220- 18:17.220* :  The train was travelling to the capital Daca from the western city of Jessor. This passenger
*18:17.220- 18:24.240* :  described how he escaped the blaze. When I opened my eyes, I could see nothing but smoke.
*18:24.760- 18:30.040* :  I threw one of my sons from the train window and a person outside caught him. Another son and my wife
*18:30.040- 18:35.440* :  somehow managed to escape. I was about to go abroad. My passport and other belongings were packed
*18:35.440- 18:40.200* :  inside the train and I couldn't recover them. Well, turning to the election, the main opposition
*18:40.200- 18:45.560* :  party is boycotting what it calls a sham pole, claiming many of its supporters have been
*18:45.560- 18:50.180* :  arrested, beaten and even killed for criticizing the government. The Prime Minister,
*18:50.180- 18:55.640* :  Sheikh Hasina, looks set to lead her party to a fourth win in a row. The BBC South Asia correspondent
*18:55.640- 19:05.040* :  Samira Hussein reports from the capital Daca. An election slogan being chanted in favor of the
*19:05.040- 19:10.120* :  ruling party. It's coming from a giant speaker attached to a white van and it's snaking through
*19:10.120- 19:16.500* :  the streets. So right in front of me there's a gentleman who is putting up political posters.
*19:16.500- 19:24.980* :  They're black and white photos of the local Awami League candidate and just above him on this poster
*19:24.980- 19:32.620* :  is a photograph of the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina. What's missing are any posters in favor of
*19:32.620- 19:41.020* :  opposition candidates. We're going to interview a woman whose husband died in prison after he
*19:41.020- 19:50.060* :  was arrested. He was a supporter of the BNP, the opposition party. To protect her, we're actually
*19:50.060- 20:01.360* :  moving somewhere further away from her house. We're walking up a flight of stairs this is a building
*20:02.340- 20:08.880* :  somewhat abandoned or under construction juries out on which one it is. We're going to do the interview
*20:08.880- 20:15.480* :  here. This woman's husband, a well-known worker for the country's main opposition party, the BNP
*20:15.480- 20:22.380* :  or the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was arrested last year. 26 days later her son got a call that
*20:22.380- 20:30.920* :  his father died in jail. Just three days earlier my son saw his father held him. My daughter spoke
*20:30.920- 20:38.620* :  to him. I spoke to him. I saw him. My son keeps saying, no, my father can't die like this.
*20:39.520- 20:44.960* :  When he asked them how my father died, they said, I don't know. Just come to Dhaka Medical College
*20:44.960- 20:51.400* :  more and take him. She said when she saw her husband, he had marks all over his body,
*20:51.400- 20:57.960* :  hands and face. Authorities told her he had died of natural causes, but she believes he was tortured.
*20:58.980- 21:03.900* :  Her story is not in isolation, especially in the lead up to the elections. There's been a
*21:03.900- 21:10.160* :  severe crackdown on freedom of expression and peaceful protests. Human Rights Watch says authorities
*21:10.160- 21:16.440* :  have been engaged in mass arrests, excessive force, torture and extrajudicial killings. The main
*21:16.440- 21:23.240* :  targets, critics of the government. Hello, good sir. Good to see you. My name is Samira.
*21:23.400- 21:30.560* :  Anisal Huck is the Minister of Law in Bangladesh. Why do you think some B&P officials and supporters
*21:30.560- 21:36.260* :  are afraid to speak in public? I don't know why. After, it's their right to speak in public.
*21:36.480- 21:41.820* :  We are not stopping them from doing so. If there is a mindset not to speak or there is an
*21:41.820- 21:47.100* :  intention to prove to the world that we can't speak. I don't know if that's the plan, but let me
*21:47.100- 21:53.240* :  make one thing very clear. We are not gagging anybody. Yes, you can speak freely, but nobody is
*21:53.240- 21:59.080* :  going to take the responsibility of the consequence. Nasr al-Islam is a leading member of the B&P,
*21:59.080- 22:05.060* :  and even he takes precautions when speaking out. Because those people who spoke freely,
*22:05.320- 22:09.920* :  they were arrested, they were beaten, tortured, some of them were killed in the jail.
*22:15.820- 22:20.240* :  With the opposition party boycotting these elections, the people of Bangladesh are left with two
*22:20.240- 22:26.020* :  options. Vote for the current ruling government, like these supporters are chanting, or vote for
*22:26.020- 22:31.160* :  independents who are also supporting the ruling government. Either way, it would likely be a win
*22:31.160- 22:37.040* :  for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is determined to show the world her country can hold free and
*22:37.040- 22:46.760* :  fair elections. Samira Hussein reporting from Bangladesh. A major Chinese financial business
*22:46.760- 22:53.980* :  has filed for bankruptcy with debts of up to $64 billion. Zongzhe Enterprise Group had been an
*22:53.980- 22:59.260* :  important part of China's shadow banking industry, and its liquidation could have wider implications
*22:59.260- 23:05.100* :  as Celia Hatton explains. China's shadow banks are legal but unregulated financial
*23:05.100- 23:12.260* :  organizations, lenders, brokers and creditors that emerge to offer loans to individuals and
*23:12.260- 23:19.080* :  smaller companies that aren't served by China's traditional banks. Zongzhe Enterprise Group, or ZEDG,
*23:19.080- 23:25.500* :  was once a major player. Its decline has tied to wider problems in China's real estate sector,
*23:25.960- 23:31.160* :  which has already seen the collapse or near bankruptcy of some of the world's biggest developers.
*23:32.160- 23:37.540* :  Now, the real estate industry, which represents around a third of China's economy, is in financial
*23:37.540- 23:44.720* :  distress, many shadow banks are also falling into debt. I age-specific regional editor, Celia Hatton.
*23:45.900- 23:52.540* :  New balls, please, so the saying goes in tennis, or some tennis stars, say they need a change
*23:52.540- 23:57.220* :  after blaming some balls for an increase in injuries. Fluffy ones are said to be the worst,
*23:57.220- 24:03.400* :  getting increasingly heavy and slow, but players are also unhappy at the wide variety they have to use.
*24:03.680- 24:07.940* :  Four weeks, four different balls, as the three-time Grand Slam Champion,
*24:07.940- 24:13.060* :  Stan Vavrinka put it recently. Now, the tennis authorities are looking at various solutions.
*24:13.060- 24:15.860* :  Our tennis car responded Russell Fuller as the details.
*24:16.420- 24:22.660* :  The players certainly think that the balls are contributing to more injuries, but when I spoke to
*24:22.660- 24:27.560* :  the men's ATP tour, they said there's no evidence to suggest there are more injuries,
*24:27.940- 24:32.840* :  or even that there's been a huge spike to particular parts of the body, like the wrist,
*24:33.020- 24:38.240* :  the elbow, the arm, or the shoulder. But at the same time, they do accept that the way the modern
*24:38.240- 24:43.840* :  game is evolving, matches are getting longer. It's an incredibly physical battle between players
*24:43.840- 24:48.220* :  that actually they do need to do something to moderate the balls, because I think they do
*24:48.220- 24:53.260* :  accept that increasingly longer matches are not in anyone's interests, and by that they
*24:53.260- 24:57.680* :  probably mean the television audience, as well as the health of the players. Tell us about the
*24:57.680- 25:02.820* :  different balls and what impact they have on the players. It's amazing how differently they can
*25:02.820- 25:08.380* :  play, and where it might be difficult to reach a consensus with a way forward is that some players
*25:08.380- 25:14.160* :  do like the balls to be heavy and slow, and therefore it's quite difficult to hit winners,
*25:14.460- 25:19.220* :  whereas other players like the balls to be lighter, that speed through the air, and it's
*25:19.220- 25:25.160* :  therefore much easier to hit winners or to hit aces. Balls also vary because of the surface
*25:25.200- 25:29.360* :  on which they're being used. There's a big difference between a play court, a grass court,
*25:29.360- 25:34.100* :  and a hard court. You've got to factor in the amount of moisture in the air, for example. Balls
*25:34.100- 25:39.180* :  will fly differently indoors and outdoors, so there's a reason why balls will vary depending on
*25:39.180- 25:44.440* :  where you're playing and on what surface. The trouble I think is that the parameters that the
*25:44.440- 25:50.440* :  manufacturers are working within are too wide, so manufacturers can sell a ball to a tournament,
*25:50.440- 25:55.840* :  and that ball can be used to the particular tournament. What the men's governing body the ATP
*25:55.840- 26:00.840* :  want to do is actually make sure that the parameters are narrower. I think the other thing that they
*26:00.840- 26:05.920* :  will look to do is change the balls more frequently within a match, which means the ball that you're
*26:05.920- 26:12.780* :  using for a particular rally should hopefully be lighter and livelier for longer, and that also
*26:12.780- 26:18.240* :  should reduce the wear and tear on wrists and elbows and shoulders. Our tennis correspondent,
*26:18.240- 26:24.160* :  Russell Fuller. Dog owners typically spend hundreds of dollars a year or more on pet food,
*26:24.160- 26:28.700* :  but a couple in the US City of Pittsburgh were shocked to find their pooch had devoured
*26:28.700- 26:35.220* :  thousands of dollars in cash in one go. Peter Goffin takes up the story. Cecil is a good boy.
*26:35.780- 26:40.480* :  He's just a big shaggy dog with a big appetite and expensive tastes.
*26:41.040- 26:46.360* :  The money was just strewn on the floor like half eaten bills and the envelope was completely gone, so.
*26:46.940- 26:52.880* :  Cecil's owners Clayton and Carrie Law had withdrawn $4,000 in cash to pay for a new fence,
*26:52.940- 26:58.620* :  but the retriever poodle mix had different ideas. Left on his own for half an hour,
*26:58.620- 27:03.160* :  he snagged the money off the kitchen counter, and then it was dinner time.
*27:04.120- 27:10.020* :  The vet said the money would not hurt Cecil, but food that rich was bound to upset his stomach a
*27:10.020- 27:14.220* :  little. I was like, I'm just going to follow him and see if anything comes out for a couple days,
*27:14.220- 27:21.880* :  and it did. Yeah. The couple painstakingly picked through Cecil's vomit and other deposits,
*27:21.900- 27:28.500* :  collecting shreds of 50 and $100 bills. They scrubbed up the scraps and pieced them back together,
*27:28.500- 27:34.660* :  like a high-priced jigsaw puzzle, and somehow they managed to recover nearly the entire sum,
*27:35.040- 27:42.100* :  $3,550. We had to have like the majority of the serial number on both sides, and the bank said if
*27:42.100- 27:47.100* :  we taped it, that would help, so I'm trying to find numbers and we'd like recover something from
*27:47.100- 27:51.720* :  what he had left in the yard and say, oh my gosh, we have a six for the serial number.
*27:52.220- 27:57.820* :  The search is still on for the remaining $450. The laws say they'll send the mismatched
*27:57.820- 28:03.080* :  bits and pieces to the US Treasury Department, which says it will redeem mutilated currency
*28:03.080- 28:09.680* :  under the right circumstances. As for Cecil's relationship with the laws, there are no hard feelings.
*28:10.220- 28:14.800* :  In reality, we were never mad, and I don't think you can really get angry at a pet for doing
*28:14.800- 28:18.220* :  something like this, and you just have to love your pet. That's what they're there for.
*28:18.480- 28:24.000* :  That report by Peter Goffin. Since they released their debut single eight months ago,
*28:24.000- 28:28.580* :  the British indie rock band The Last Dinner Party have had a meteoric rise. They've
*28:28.580- 28:33.680* :  toured with Florence and the machine, made their Glastonbury debut, and won the rising star prize
*28:33.680- 28:39.200* :  at the Brit Awards, the UK's equivalent of the Grammys. On Friday, they joined the likes of 50
*28:39.200- 28:46.060* :  cent Adele and Sam Smith, by winning the BBC's prestigious Sound of 2024. Our music correspondent
*28:46.180- 28:47.900* :  Mark Savage went to meet them.
*28:58.780- 29:05.040* :  Does it feel like that kind of all of these people, the 149 critics and the DJs and the festival
*29:05.040- 29:11.180* :  bookers all think, okay, you're not just A sign of 2094, a one of the signs of 2024, you're the
*29:11.660- 29:18.120* :  sign of 2024, that's a big definite article. I guess it's hard to like comprehend because we
*29:18.120- 29:22.680* :  don't we haven't seen any of these people. The only time I think any of this will sink in is if we're
*29:22.680- 29:28.200* :  on a stage in front of a crowd of people who without looking at us, engaging with the music and enjoying it.
*29:36.680- 29:42.200* :  But you developed so much, you know, I've seen you twice and you feel like you own the stages that
*29:42.200- 29:46.720* :  you play on. What are the things you picked up along the way? We've shared a stage with Florence
*29:46.720- 29:51.820* :  Machine and we're on the tour with Rosie at the minute, so I think it's learning from these people
*29:51.820- 29:57.880* :  who have been in the music industry for so long and they know how to occupy a stage and to
*29:57.880- 30:02.600* :  command attention of a massive arena. So yeah, it's been good to learn from from these artists.
*30:12.380- 30:15.560* :  And you mentioned Florence, she was just here. She was just a small heart.
*30:17.800- 30:21.400* :  But she was giving you, you know, little bits of advice from when she'd been at this stage in
*30:21.400- 30:26.260* :  her career. What's it like to have that support from the artist that you looked up to?
*30:27.360- 30:32.280* :  Indescribable, so precious, really. Getting emotional, Joe, because I think Florence
*30:32.280- 30:39.320* :  meant quite a lot to you. No, no, no, no, it's fine. No, I discovered her music when I was like
*30:39.740- 30:47.080* :  nine and I was like, oh my god, I feel understood and like connected to a person and she lived on
*30:47.080- 30:53.240* :  the other side of the world. And so I've heard, say, like that she's proud of us. And like
*30:54.740- 31:01.260* :  that we are doing something that she wished that she had seen. It's just like so insane.
*31:09.500- 31:13.560* :  My lady of Mercy's mother, incredible song. On Instagram, you wrote,
*31:13.640- 31:18.520* :  it's a bite being a girl that tells me more of what does that mean. I had a very kind of
*31:18.540- 31:22.360* :  strict Catholic upbringing when I was a Catholic school and when I kind of was becoming a teenager
*31:22.360- 31:29.100* :  and you know, you're simultaneously having like a massive horrible hormonal, spiritual, emotional
*31:30.060- 31:35.220* :  change and then going throughout the same time as sort of not being straight in a Catholic school.
*31:35.520- 31:39.500* :  It's just a lot of turmoil, but it's I remember at that time grappling with those feelings
*31:39.500- 31:46.000* :  but finding immense comfort in sort of looking at images of martyrs and sexuality in religion
*31:46.460- 31:50.200* :  and instead of, you know, closing myself off to that, I thought it was actually a really good
*31:50.200- 31:56.020* :  way of exploring sex and desire and lust and all that as many have done before.
*32:02.980- 32:07.640* :  The winners of the BBC Sound of 2024, the last dinner party talking to Mark Savage.
*32:10.540- 32:14.760* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back at the same time
*32:14.760- 32:19.980* :  tomorrow. This edition was mixed by Ethan Connolly Forster and produced by Emma Joseph. Our editor
*32:19.980- 32:23.420* :  is Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
