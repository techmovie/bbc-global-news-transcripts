*01:23.180- 01:26.040* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:29.340- 01:34.400* :  I'm Chris Barrow and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 15th of January, these are our main stories.
*01:35.000- 01:39.540* :  Ukraine claims to have dealt a major blow to Russia's air power by destroying two planes.
*01:40.120- 01:44.100* :  ethnic rebels in Western Myanmar say they've captured a strategic town near the border
*01:44.100- 01:46.660* :  with India, the latest setback for the ruling military.
*01:47.180- 01:51.860* :  Bernardo Arrevalo is finally sworn in as Guatemala's new president after hours of delays.
*01:55.140- 01:59.980* :  Also in the podcast, voters in Iowa are preparing to choose the Republican nominee in the campaign
*01:59.980- 02:00.860* :  for the White House.
*02:07.880- 02:07.940* :  And in footballâ€¦
*02:08.000- 02:12.460* :  Can Mo Salah help Egypt win the Africa Cup of Nations after a slow start?
*02:17.980- 02:22.360* :  We begin in Ukraine where the country's military has been struggling to make significant gains
*02:22.360- 02:24.180* :  against Russia in recent months.
*02:24.520- 02:28.900* :  But now it's announced what analysts have described as potentially a major blow to Moscow,
*02:28.980- 02:32.180* :  the shooting down of a Russian spy plane and a command plane.
*02:32.640- 02:37.820* :  Ukraine says its Air Force destroyed an A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft and an
*02:37.820- 02:41.920* :  ill-22 air control centre, but the BBC hasn't verified that.
*02:42.440- 02:46.520* :  BBC Monitoring's Russia editor Vitaly Chevchenko has been looking at some pictures
*02:46.520- 02:48.560* :  that are emerging of one of the damaged planes.
*02:49.240- 02:56.100* :  One of the two planes, the ill-22, which is a flying command post, and it looks like
*02:56.100- 03:04.460* :  it was able to make it to an airfield, but one picture, we haven't absolutely definitely
*03:04.460- 03:10.560* :  verified it, but it looks like it's an ill-22 and it shows it completely shredded apparently
*03:10.560- 03:13.900* :  by a surface-to-air missile.
*03:14.420- 03:20.780* :  Now the more important plane, which Ukraine claims to have a shot down, is the A-50.
*03:21.400- 03:27.760* :  It's a massive flying radar, basically, with a huge circular radar on top of it.
*03:28.220- 03:32.400* :  It's apparently one of only six that Russia has.
*03:32.460- 03:33.740* :  It's hugely expensive.
*03:33.740- 03:42.200* :  It costs between $250 and $300 million, and it looks like it was shot down by Ukraine.
*03:42.460- 03:49.560* :  What it does, it helps a Russian military to track targets, like aerial targets, and
*03:49.560- 03:56.320* :  also targets on the ground, such as missile systems, and also coordinate Russian attacks
*03:56.340- 03:56.880* :  in Ukraine.
*03:56.980- 04:03.460* :  If it's true that it was shot down, it's a massively important blow to Russian forces,
*04:03.820- 04:11.000* :  and also Russia doesn't really have many people, many crews, who can operate this kind
*04:11.000- 04:14.980* :  of plane, so it's a potentially very significant development.
*04:15.340- 04:20.120* :  Presumably, to train up people who can use it would take years, and they may not just
*04:20.120- 04:21.260* :  not have those resources available.
*04:21.700- 04:22.120* :  Absolutely.
*04:22.460- 04:23.500* :  It takes time.
*04:23.500- 04:31.180* :  It takes money, and this development comes at a crucial juncture when Ukrainian, the
*04:31.180- 04:34.460* :  so-called counteroffensive, it's not had much success.
*04:34.460- 04:35.320* :  It's stalling.
*04:35.320- 04:42.460* :  There have been reports of various morale issues in Ukraine, lots of alarming news for
*04:42.460- 04:50.120* :  Ukraine in terms of continued or lack of continued assistance from the West, so if this is true
*04:50.120- 04:56.440* :  that Ukraine's shot down or damaged these two really important planes, that might serve
*04:56.440- 05:01.900* :  as a morale booster for the Ukrainians and an embarrassing blow for the Russians.
*05:02.160- 05:03.520* :  Will we get a definitive answer?
*05:04.200- 05:08.200* :  We often hear about drones being shot down, and it's very hard to confirm the numbers.
*05:08.200- 05:09.640* :  Will we ever actually truly know?
*05:10.120- 05:14.280* :  Will there, because I know Ukraine are claiming it at this stage, but I guess this is the
*05:14.280- 05:16.020* :  fog of war that goes on.
*05:16.020- 05:17.520* :  You never truly know what's going on.
*05:18.060- 05:21.780* :  I doubt that we're going to hear anything definitive from the Russians.
*05:21.840- 05:25.200* :  It's not like them to announce such embarrassing news.
*05:25.860- 05:33.520* :  We might see potentially pictures of the wreckage of the other plane, the A50.
*05:33.520- 05:39.100* :  We have seen a picture of what appears to be the ill-22, and there's also an audio
*05:39.100- 05:46.300* :  clip circulating on social media, which appears to be an intercept of Russian air traffic
*05:46.560- 05:53.320* :  communications, and it says that an ill-22 needs to make an emergency landing and an ambulance
*05:53.320- 05:54.480* :  and a fire truck is required.
*05:54.480- 05:59.160* :  This is the kind of thing that will help us understand what's going on, but definitive,
*05:59.780- 06:01.060* :  it's very unlikely to be.
*06:01.720- 06:03.000* :  Vitaly Shepchenko
*06:03.560- 06:08.080* :  The military government of Myanmar is facing the greatest challenge to its authority since
*06:08.080- 06:12.460* :  2021 when it sees power and violently beat back opposition protests.
*06:13.140- 06:16.800* :  For months, an alliance of ethnic minority rebel groups has been winning back territory
*06:16.800- 06:21.020* :  in the East on the Chinese border, and now on the other side of the country, rebels
*06:21.020- 06:23.180* :  have seized a key town near the border with India.
*06:23.660- 06:26.080* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head reports.
*06:26.680- 06:31.660* :  The Arakhan Army is one of the best equipped of Myanmar's many ethnic armed groups and
*06:31.660- 06:36.300* :  has been battling the military and gaining ground in Rakhine State for several years.
*06:36.920- 06:42.980* :  However, after the military sees power in 2021, the AA initially agreed to a cease-fire,
*06:43.340- 06:47.340* :  freeing the army to fight opposition to its coup in the rest of the country.
*06:47.860- 06:52.560* :  But last October, the AA announced it was joining the wider struggle against military
*06:52.560- 06:55.160* :  rule and launched a series of attacks.
*06:55.600- 07:01.200* :  The last fortified army post near Palettewa was captured on Saturday, and now AA soldiers
*07:01.200- 07:06.040* :  have posted images of themselves standing in front of Palettewa's town hall.
*07:06.600- 07:07.260* :  Jonathan Head
*07:07.720- 07:12.920* :  It took more than nine hours of political infighting protests and even foreign intervention,
*07:12.920- 07:15.900* :  but Guatemala has finally sworn in its new president.
*07:25.620- 07:29.740* :  The ceremony for Bernardo Arevalo was meant to take place on Sunday afternoon, but his
*07:29.740- 07:33.960* :  political opponents, who've spent months trying to block his entry to power, did everything
*07:33.960- 07:35.840* :  they could to stop the event from going ahead.
*07:36.380- 07:38.140* :  Peter Goffin has been following the story.
*07:38.620- 07:45.060* :  Bernardo Arevalo won a landslide election victory back in August, promising to bring progress
*07:45.060- 07:50.800* :  and reform to Guatemala, but his Simea party holds just a tiny minority of the seats in
*07:50.800- 07:51.440* :  the Congress.
*07:52.160- 07:57.560* :  And he's faced this block of conservative establishment politicians, significantly even
*07:57.560- 08:03.180* :  the Attorney General, Consuelo Poros, they've been doing everything they can since the election
*08:03.180- 08:07.260* :  to hamstring his ability to govern, even to ban his party.
*08:07.740- 08:12.260* :  So on Sunday morning, the country's top court ruled that Simea party members of Congress
*08:12.260- 08:16.180* :  would have to take office not as members of their party, but as independence.
*08:18.140- 08:22.540* :  Members within Congress to argue over who should be allowed to take part in the swearing
*08:22.540- 08:23.240* :  in ceremony.
*08:23.240- 08:28.220* :  In the end, one of Mr. Arevalo's allies was elected to lead the Congress anyway.
*08:28.340- 08:34.240* :  Meanwhile, President Arevalo accused his opponents of deliberately trying to stop his inauguration.
*08:34.240- 08:38.280* :  His supporters had threatened to storm the capital of the swearing and didn't happen.
*08:38.700- 08:43.480* :  The US waited in calling for democracy to be upheld and Mr. Arevalo to be sworn in.
*08:44.200- 08:45.060* :  You're getting the picture here.
*08:45.060- 08:49.380* :  This process has been described as complete chaos, but given that people were threatening
*08:49.380- 08:51.560* :  to storm the capital, I suppose it could have been worse.
*08:51.840- 08:52.500* :  Certainly could have.
*08:52.500- 08:54.900* :  But why is he such a divisive figure, though?
*08:55.940- 09:01.560* :  Well, he's seen by Guatemalans as a man who's going to dismantle and rebuild Guatemalan's
*09:01.680- 09:03.080* :  entire political culture.
*09:03.160- 09:09.520* :  This is a country where more than half the population live in poverty, a string of conservative
*09:09.520- 09:16.000* :  governments has been accused by particularly indigenous groups and people in rural communities
*09:16.000- 09:18.040* :  of failing to address their needs.
*09:18.040- 09:23.800* :  But also of corruption, of human rights violations, and only representing the elites.
*09:23.800- 09:28.020* :  And Mr. Arevalo has come in as a center left politician.
*09:28.100- 09:31.640* :  The son of Guatemala's first ever democratically elected president.
*09:32.040- 09:36.940* :  He's promised accountability, and he said his guiding principle is that there cannot be
*09:36.940- 09:42.500* :  democracy without social justice and social justice cannot prevail without democracy.
*09:42.580- 09:47.600* :  And if you ask, Mr. Arevalo's supporters, that type of attitude makes the people who
*09:47.600- 09:48.940* :  have been in power for many years.
*09:48.940- 09:52.660* :  And those who have benefited from their leadership, very nervous.
*09:53.100- 09:56.780* :  We talked about the delays to get to this point, but it wasn't just that.
*09:56.780- 09:59.900* :  There were some reports of an assassination plot against him.
*10:00.280- 10:00.840* :  Yeah, that's right.
*10:00.860- 10:05.580* :  That's sort of the most extreme element of the opposition against him.
*10:05.580- 10:10.940* :  This emerged right after his election, victory in August, the Inter-American Commission
*10:10.940- 10:15.940* :  on Human Rights, said there'd been an alleged plan by unnamed public officials to have
*10:15.940- 10:16.560* :  him killed.
*10:17.080- 10:20.080* :  But there were also attempts to have his vice president arrested because of student
*10:20.080- 10:24.620* :  protests and damage done during those by Mr. Arevalo's supporters.
*10:24.620- 10:28.460* :  A court had to issue immunity from Mr. Arevalo and his running mate.
*10:29.040- 10:33.500* :  And then on the more pedestrian side, you had his opponents in Congress drastically limit
*10:33.500- 10:36.780* :  his budget to limit how much he can do as president.
*10:36.780- 10:41.040* :  One observer has said he's been given the budget for a Toyota, but the country expects
*10:41.040- 10:42.260* :  him to get a Ferrari.
*10:42.260- 10:44.120* :  So we'll see what he's able to do now.
*10:44.120- 10:44.700* :  He's in power.
*10:45.360- 10:46.260* :  Peter Goffin there.
*10:46.640- 10:51.300* :  To the US now, where people in Iowa are preparing to cast the first votes in the campaign
*10:51.300- 10:55.040* :  for the White House, they're having their say on who should be the Republican presidential
*10:55.040- 10:55.560* :  nominee.
*10:55.660- 10:58.720* :  And Donald Trump is by far no way the favorite to win.
*10:59.220- 11:03.680* :  The new poll in the state gives him a 28-point advantage over his nearest rival, the former
*11:03.680- 11:08.280* :  UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, and she's ahead of the Florida Governor, Rhonda Santis.
*11:08.740- 11:12.160* :  But a winter blizzard means that we're in for even more unpredictability.
*11:12.680- 11:14.720* :  Our correspondent, Nomiya Igbal, is in Iowa.
*11:15.240- 11:20.220* :  Every presidential cycle, the quiet Midwest and state of Iowa, gets swamped by politicians.
*11:20.940- 11:23.840* :  And this year, a once in a decade winter blizzard.
*11:23.840- 11:27.900* :  A blizzard warning remains an effect here.
*11:27.900- 11:31.560* :  We also have a wind chill warning in effect until noon on Tuesday.
*11:31.560- 11:34.920* :  The Democrats have changed their schedule, so it's all eyes on the Republicans.
*11:35.480- 11:39.080* :  No matter how hard they try, it doesn't make any difference.
*11:39.080- 11:40.360* :  We will never give up.
*11:40.560- 11:41.520* :  We will never surrender.
*11:41.520- 11:44.760* :  In the end, we are going to win, win, win, win, win.
*11:46.000- 11:48.560* :  Donald Trump dominates, despite his legal problems.
*11:49.180- 11:51.680* :  And so much of the battle here is who can take him on.
*11:51.720- 11:56.460* :  There's the Florida Governor, Rhonda Santis, who's so-called war on woke, is his main
*11:56.460- 11:57.580* :  promise to voters.
*11:57.880- 11:59.760* :  We will fight the woke in the legislature.
*11:59.780- 12:02.000* :  We will fight the woke in education.
*12:02.180- 12:07.780* :  We will fight the woke in the businesses we will never, ever surrender to the woke mob.
*12:07.780- 12:13.820* :  He is besting heavily on Iowa to give him momentum, visiting all 99 counties in the state.
*12:14.380- 12:18.720* :  As a rally event, supporter, Rhonda Wax, told us she wants him in the White House.
*12:18.860- 12:19.940* :  We love our country.
*12:19.940- 12:21.760* :  It's an important election.
*12:22.180- 12:23.740* :  He checks all the boxes for me.
*12:23.880- 12:28.620* :  We can't have any values, integrity, fiscal responsibility.
*12:29.360- 12:32.840* :  Also hoping to do well here is the former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley.
*12:32.880- 12:36.960* :  We can't have a country and disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years
*12:36.960- 12:37.500* :  of chaos.
*12:37.900- 12:38.880* :  We won't survive it.
*12:39.020- 12:41.860* :  And there's also the big tech outsider, Vivek Ramaswamy.
*12:41.880- 12:46.900* :  If I over side issues, but on the court issues, both parties are actually aligned with the
*12:46.900- 12:50.660* :  destructive agenda of this country that has left us more vulnerable than we've ever been.
*12:53.140- 12:56.840* :  Candidates biggest battle right now is not each other, but the weather.
*12:57.140- 13:02.100* :  Because the way a caucus works is that voters have to show up in person at certain locations,
*13:02.700- 13:06.420* :  like schools, gyms and libraries at a preset time.
*13:06.460- 13:13.180* :  The Iowa has been plunged into this deep freeze covering the state in mountains of snow.
*13:13.300- 13:18.580* :  The warning is don't stay out for longer than 10 minutes, which means there is a chance
*13:18.580- 13:20.900* :  it could affect voter turnout.
*13:22.860- 13:27.640* :  We soon found warmth in a local bar to find out how people are feeling about the caucus.
*13:27.960- 13:28.860* :  Tell me, are you a caucus?
*13:29.740- 13:30.500* :  Not sure yet.
*13:30.500- 13:33.400* :  I'm not a huge fan of anyone really running.
*13:33.800- 13:38.080* :  I just feel like a lot of what's being represented by a lot of candidates doesn't really
*13:38.080- 13:41.200* :  affect actual working class people.
*13:41.440- 13:42.800* :  Our country needs a lot of help right now.
*13:43.580- 13:46.840* :  I just want somebody who's actually going to take care of the people.
*13:47.220- 13:50.720* :  I'm a teacher and we do a straw poll amongst students and I think that's a good indicator
*13:50.720- 13:51.660* :  of where their parents go.
*13:52.100- 13:56.120* :  So when it comes to Republicans that I think that they are leaning towards Donald Trump.
*13:56.480- 14:01.100* :  Whoever wins Iowa doesn't necessarily get the presidential nomination or go on to win
*14:01.100- 14:04.860* :  the White House, but this is a place that can make or break a candidate.
*14:05.400- 14:08.440* :  Trump wants to deliver a knockout punch to his rivals.

*14:48.420- 14:52.580* :  There's this massive landslide of myth and somewhere in there is the truth.

*15:44.320- 15:49.480* :  In Taiwan, the newly elected President William Lai has committed to protecting Taiwan's sovereignty
*15:49.480- 15:54.200* :  in the face of increasing hostility by Beijing, which views the territory as its own.
*15:54.660- 15:59.100* :  Taiwan has formal ties with only a handful of countries, almost all small, less developed
*15:59.100- 16:02.200* :  nations in Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
*16:02.880- 16:07.420* :  Now it's lost another ally, the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru, has said it will
*16:07.420- 16:12.800* :  sever diplomatic relations with Taipei immediately in favour of China, mounting as a spokesperson
*16:12.800- 16:14.360* :  for the Chinese foreign ministry.
*16:17.400- 16:22.500* :  The Nauru government's decision to resume diplomatic ties with China fully demonstrates
*16:22.500- 16:28.920* :  once again that the one China principle reflects the sentiments of the people and is in line
*16:28.920- 16:30.060* :  with the general trend.
*16:30.840- 16:36.920* :  China's willing to open a new chapter in bilateral ties with Nauru on the basis of the one China
*16:37.600- 16:37.620* :  principle.
*16:38.220- 16:39.880* :  So why has Nauru switched allegiance?
*16:39.880- 16:43.500* :  I asked our Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton, who's in Taipei?
*16:44.000- 16:51.140* :  I think it's pretty clear that this was engineered by Beijing in order to express China's
*16:51.140- 16:56.160* :  displeasure over the election result that came out in Taiwan over the weekend.
*16:56.740- 17:01.580* :  Taiwanese voters elected William Lai as the country's next president.
*17:01.580- 17:03.520* :  That was not Beijing's choice.
*17:03.520- 17:10.720* :  They had really been pushing hard for Lai's rival to win, his rival came from a much
*17:10.720- 17:14.940* :  more pro-Baging party, but that's not what Taiwanese voters went for.
*17:14.940- 17:20.500* :  They went for William Lai, who has been much more interested in pushing the idea of Taiwan's
*17:20.640- 17:25.460* :  sovereignty and really has been pushing for Taiwan to become much closer to the United
*17:25.460- 17:29.340* :  States and to build ties with the rest of the world and not to cozy up to Beijing.
*17:29.700- 17:33.860* :  Has William Lai said anything about Nauru switching allegiance at this stage?
*17:34.280- 17:40.000* :  I mean, the Taiwanese government as a whole has expressed their unhappiness over this
*17:41.680- 17:41.700* :  switch.
*17:41.700- 17:41.880* :  Frankly, there's not much they can do.
*17:41.880- 17:47.660* :  They're now down to just 11 countries plus the Vatican that have diplomatic ties with
*17:47.660- 17:48.380* :  Taiwan.
*17:48.380- 17:50.580* :  So it just leaves Taiwan being more isolated.
*17:50.900- 17:52.240* :  Is it a big setback for them?
*17:52.240- 17:54.420* :  Is it we were looking at the population is 12,000?
*17:54.420- 17:57.780* :  It's not a huge island, but you never want to lose allies.
*17:58.560- 18:02.820* :  Yeah, I mean, the whole point is how many countries in the world recognize that Taiwan
*18:02.820- 18:08.200* :  is a sovereign nation and Taiwan is increasingly isolated diplomatically.
*18:08.460- 18:09.900* :  That's really the issue.
*18:10.340- 18:13.920* :  But as this happens, Chris, the important thing is that there's also lots of countries
*18:13.920- 18:18.860* :  that don't formally recognize Taiwan, but they still maintain ties.
*18:19.180- 18:22.720* :  Many countries have extended their congratulations to Taiwan.
*18:23.240- 18:30.040* :  Countries like Japan, Germany, Lithuania, Singapore, the list goes on for holding a free and
*18:30.040- 18:31.720* :  fair election over the weekend.
*18:31.860- 18:36.240* :  You know, Taiwan has a very, very strong democracy in place.
*18:36.720- 18:38.540* :  That was Celia Hatton in Taipei.
*18:39.240- 18:45.000* :  The number of Palestinians now killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza is just under 24,000 according
*18:45.000- 18:46.620* :  to the Hamas-run health ministry.
*18:47.000- 18:49.720* :  Many more are believed to be in the rubble of their destroyed homes.
*18:50.380- 18:54.440* :  Our correspondent Caroline Hawley has been speaking to one woman in the central town of
*18:54.440- 18:56.960* :  Dei Albala, who's lost her mother and sister.
*19:00.180- 19:07.120* :  Rewa Mossin enjoys a quiet moment with her baby tocker, born just two days before Hamas
*19:07.120- 19:10.340* :  attacked southern Israel, and Gaza took the consequences.
*19:12.620- 19:17.560* :  Rewa sent me video of tocker wrapped up in a pink Hello Kitty sheet and a blanket with
*19:17.600- 19:18.100* :  rainbows.
*19:20.180- 19:24.160* :  Rewa's mother had come to stay with them to help with the baby, but then went back to
*19:24.160- 19:25.620* :  the family home in Hanyunas.
*19:25.900- 19:28.900* :  She begged Rewa to go to, thinking it would be safe.
*19:29.400- 19:32.300* :  From other words, my house was safe.
*19:32.760- 19:41.260* :  We don't have anyone who has a relationship with Hamas or Algeria or any association,
*19:41.780- 19:49.540* :  but suddenly on the 27th of October, I woke up on the news that my house was attacked,
*19:51.360- 19:55.140* :  and I couldn't hear any news about my family.
*19:55.700- 19:58.460* :  Her mother and sister had severe burns over their bodies.
*19:59.180- 20:02.040* :  It was agony for Rewa to know the pain they suffered.
*20:02.040- 20:09.320* :  I called my sister on her last day, she was screaming, I'm in pain.
*20:11.140- 20:11.900* :  I'm dying.
*20:18.820- 20:23.800* :  Somehow through her grief and anger, Rewa has had to keep going for tocker and her two
*20:23.800- 20:24.620* :  year old Asma.
*20:25.220- 20:32.780* :  I look at my daughter's face like, I'm sorry for you, I couldn't give you the attention
*20:33.160- 20:37.700* :  you need, could not give her the kindness, I was always nervous.
*20:38.180- 20:40.800* :  I'm not your mother, I'm not your Asma.
*20:41.520- 20:46.040* :  Just giving her family the basics of life is an enormous challenge with no electricity,
*20:46.040- 20:50.060* :  no running water, and food she says at astronomical prices.
*20:54.360- 20:57.200* :  The sound of Israeli drones is the backdrop to daily life.
*20:58.840- 21:02.660* :  Rewa washes the baby clothes in a bucket with water they fetch every five days.
*21:03.180- 21:10.240* :  The life we live every day is a bad routine, just to wake up looking for the breakfast looking
*21:10.240- 21:17.440* :  for the lunch, until now I'm still in my room, but for others they don't have even a
*21:17.440- 21:17.700* :  room.
*21:18.280- 21:23.940* :  You can't imagine how people are feeling bad in the streets, they are crowded.
*21:24.520- 21:28.300* :  With all of that, what kind of a future do you see for tocker?
*21:28.740- 21:30.500* :  Any moment we may die.
*21:30.960- 21:37.160* :  You just sometimes wish to die, because it's easier than this life.
*21:37.740- 21:41.120* :  So I can't see any future for tocker.
*21:44.140- 21:53.120* :  I just thought the war end and then I may think of my future first to take care of them.
*21:56.340- 22:00.680* :  When Rewa and her family are just one of so many families trying to get through the
*22:00.680- 22:04.820* :  next day as they mourn, in a territory where one in a hundred are thought to be dead,
*22:05.400- 22:07.020* :  and everyone's been scarred.
*22:09.580- 22:11.020* :  Caroline Hawley with that report.
*22:11.800- 22:15.980* :  This weekend her mass, which is considered a terrorist organization by America and the
*22:15.980- 22:21.420* :  UK, released a video showing three Israeli hostages pleading for a ceasefire in Gaza and
*22:21.420- 22:22.260* :  to be brought home.
*22:22.780- 22:25.880* :  The three were among those taken during the October the 7th attacks.
*22:25.900- 22:30.200* :  Hamas says that on Monday it will reveal the fate of the three hostages.
*22:30.820- 22:33.860* :  Moshe Emilio Laviz brother-in-law is a hostage in Gaza.
*22:34.300- 22:38.720* :  It's been a difficult time for us, 100 days is unimaginable.
*22:39.040- 22:46.180* :  My brother-in-law, we are still captive and we do know we can to advocate for him, but
*22:46.180- 22:54.700* :  we also deal with the trauma from October 7th and all that happened after, which include
*22:54.700- 23:01.980* :  displacement of the family and dealing with a lot of other issues, mental issues that
*23:01.980- 23:08.460* :  comes with surviving atrocities like what happened to my sister and my two baby nieces.
*23:08.840- 23:13.560* :  We know that six weeks ago it was alive because one of the hostages was released before
*23:13.560- 23:19.080* :  today saw him in one of the tunnels, but that was six weeks ago and now we're already
*23:19.120- 23:20.160* :  one on the days later.
*23:20.440- 23:25.620* :  He's still captive and we don't know whereabouts, we don't know his condition, we don't know
*23:25.620- 23:26.400* :  where he's alive.
*23:27.460- 23:31.740* :  Well let's turn our attention to sport now and we're heading to Africa and the continent's
*23:31.740- 23:36.480* :  biggest sporting event, the Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast, and the country spent
*23:36.480- 23:40.680* :  more than a billion dollars on stadiums as well as improving infrastructure like roads,
*23:40.680- 23:42.060* :  hotels and hospitals.
*23:42.720- 23:46.240* :  James Coppinole has been catching up with a few supporters to get a sense of the mood
*23:46.240- 23:46.440* :  there.
*23:47.140- 23:53.560* :  We've got a dope team individually and the team feels like collectively as well, we can
*23:53.560- 23:54.060* :  do something.
*23:54.560- 23:58.940* :  How did you feel seeing an Africa Cup of Nations right here in Cote d'Ivoire?
*23:59.080- 23:59.520* :  So proud.
*23:59.860- 24:03.820* :  So proud, I think the opening ceremony was international status.
*24:04.480- 24:07.840* :  It's a stepping stone for the continent and especially for Cote d'Ivoire.
*24:08.000- 24:11.700* :  People are going to look at the country differently, grateful Cote d'Ivoire and grateful
*24:11.700- 24:12.100* :  continent.
*24:12.380- 24:18.140* :  We want to show Africa that I recalls the country that counts in the continent because we
*24:18.140- 24:23.160* :  have the talents, we have the people, we have the expertise to do such kind of competition.
*24:23.480- 24:29.500* :  My name is Barbara from Kenya, I love the stadium, of course, I love the opening ceremony,
*24:29.500- 24:33.820* :  the fact that they've been able to tell the African story through football.
*24:34.100- 24:37.760* :  East Africa is going to host a joint Africa Cup of Nations in a few years' time.
*24:38.060- 24:39.560* :  Are you taking some ideas back home?
*24:39.940- 24:44.980* :  Definitely, definitely, embracing our culture and telling the African story from the East
*24:44.980- 24:46.360* :  African side through football.
*24:46.760- 24:50.320* :  Well, Egypt are the most successful nation in Africa Cup of Nations history.
*24:50.320- 24:55.800* :  They have seven titles, but their last big win was back in 2010 and all the talk in the
*24:55.800- 24:59.720* :  build up to the tournament and their opening match in Ivory Coast was whether Mo Salah
*24:59.720- 25:01.920* :  could secure his first Afcon title.
*25:02.420- 25:06.580* :  They began their campaign against Group B, opponents Mozambique who haven't won in their
*25:06.580- 25:08.280* :  last four appearances at the tournament.
*25:08.840- 25:11.440* :  Our Sports News Correspondent Alex Capstick was at the game.
*25:17.500- 25:24.300* :  Everybody is talking about him, even Ivorians are wearing the red Egyptian shirt with the
*25:24.300- 25:26.760* :  name Mo Salah, written on the back.
*25:26.760- 25:33.580* :  He is a huge superstar, the Liverpool forward, twice an Afcon runner-up, can the 31-year-old
*25:33.580- 25:39.000* :  Pharaohs captain, one of Africa's all-time best footballers finally get his hands on the
*25:39.040- 25:40.100* :  Cup of Nations trophy.
*25:43.800- 25:45.680* :  He's a superstar, everyone knows him.
*25:46.760- 25:49.680* :  The people here from Egypt come to see Mo Salah.
*25:50.320- 25:54.540* :  He's one of the top 10 greatest players over the world.
*25:54.760- 25:55.960* :  You're going to win this tournament then?
*25:56.120- 25:57.080* :  Yes, I'm going to win.
*25:58.400- 26:01.420* :  He's the most important in our team.
*26:02.200- 26:04.760* :  He made a big history for him and for Egypt.
*26:05.740- 26:10.320* :  But to cement that place, does he have to win this title, the African Cup of Nations?
*26:11.380- 26:14.600* :  Any here I have, yes, because he's on the front on him.
*26:15.060- 26:20.880* :  Hopefully this will be the one, but then he has done a lot and he's dedicated, he's
*26:20.920- 26:22.200* :  carried to what he's doing.
*26:22.200- 26:28.400* :  He's not focusing too much on what people say about him, which makes him a successful player.
*26:29.220- 26:31.080* :  This is the last chance for him.
*26:31.720- 26:32.600* :  We're hobbit.
*26:33.380- 26:34.120* :  We're hobbit.
*26:34.400- 26:34.960* :  We're hobbit.
*26:35.440- 26:36.160* :  We're hobbit.
*26:36.220- 26:37.260* :  Mo Salah.
*26:37.260- 26:37.860* :  Yes.
*26:38.100- 26:39.100* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:39.720- 26:40.360* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:40.440- 26:40.600* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:40.620- 26:41.980* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:42.040- 26:43.360* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:43.480- 26:44.300* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:44.300- 26:44.780* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:44.860- 26:46.120* :  Ho Salmi.
*26:46.560- 26:51.280* :  The problem for Egypt and for Mahamishallah was that those unbeach happened, read the script,
*26:51.460- 26:54.120* :  despite going a goal behind, very early on in the game.
*26:54.120- 26:58.540* :  They clung on and then scored twice in quick succession of the second period and looked
*26:58.540- 27:03.360* :  as though they were heading for what would have been a shot victory, but then a penalty
*27:03.360- 27:08.700* :  was given deep into injury time after a VAR check and upstepped Mahamishallah under great
*27:08.700- 27:11.960* :  pressure to score the ball going in off the post.
*27:11.960- 27:17.400* :  So Egypt just about escaped with a draw, not the start, they're expected.
*27:17.880- 27:20.000* :  Was Wittin for more beta or more than that?
*27:20.600- 27:21.520* :  You're watching more from those.
*27:21.640- 27:21.820* :  Yes.
*27:22.180- 27:26.880* :  Was Wittin, Salah, has given like two or three goals, but Nick is too much in shot.
*27:27.800- 27:30.820* :  So he will do beta or more than this.
*27:31.760- 27:33.080* :  Depending on the most salat.
*27:33.660- 27:35.320* :  And we don't know what to do.
*27:35.420- 27:37.000* :  Depending on the most salat, especially.
*27:37.700- 27:40.680* :  They have to go all for one and one for all.
*27:41.440- 27:44.940* :  So you're saying the team relies on most salat too much?
*27:45.500- 27:45.700* :  No.
*27:45.700- 27:47.360* :  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
*27:47.420- 27:50.740* :  Because everything they give to salat, salat, salat.
*27:50.860- 27:51.620* :  No, it's not good.
*27:52.160- 27:54.440* :  They have to play as a team, not for one.
*27:55.540- 27:56.420* :  Not for more salat.
*27:56.760- 27:58.400* :  They have to play for the team.
*27:58.580- 27:59.480* :  You've got two games to go.
*27:59.800- 28:00.780* :  Two games to the group to go.
*28:00.780- 28:01.340* :  So it's not over.
*28:01.920- 28:02.800* :  No, it's not the end of the run.
*28:03.600- 28:03.960* :  For sure.
*28:05.640- 28:09.780* :  Alex Kampstick and for more every matchday listen to World Football at Afcon
*28:09.780- 28:11.540* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*28:12.880- 28:16.060* :  Well, recently we've reported on the private Peregrine mission to the moon,
*28:16.220- 28:17.440* :  which failed because of a glitch.
*28:17.700- 28:21.060* :  And NASA's bid to send humans back there has been delayed by a year.
*28:21.560- 28:25.780* :  New book has just been published in the UK called Armune a human history.
*28:26.580- 28:27.740* :  Rebecca Boyle, its author,
*28:28.080- 28:30.800* :  told us about her lifelong passion for the celestial body.
*28:31.440- 28:33.260* :  I remember being a kid.
*28:33.520- 28:37.100* :  I think I was probably in fifth grade, so about 12.
*28:37.100- 28:39.720* :  And sitting on the floor of my school library,
*28:39.720- 28:44.800* :  listening to this vinyl record of recording of your Apollo landing transcripts.
*28:48.860- 28:50.440* :  And we're getting a picture on the TV.
*28:52.460- 28:55.200* :  And I just remember thinking this was so surreal.
*28:55.200- 28:56.680* :  This couldn't be.
*28:56.680- 28:57.520* :  They were up there.
*28:57.520- 29:00.000* :  This is so bizarre to me and so amazing.
*29:00.040- 29:05.000* :  And I guess I just never lost that sense of awe about the moon itself
*29:05.040- 29:08.400* :  and our whole relationship to it ever since I was a kid.
*29:08.700- 29:10.700* :  One small step for man.
*29:13.760- 29:16.060* :  One giant leap for mankind.
*29:17.060- 29:21.000* :  I think one thing I want people to have a sense of is just that the moon
*29:21.000- 29:25.560* :  is so much unlike anywhere on earth that it's almost hard to imagine.
*29:26.220- 29:27.920* :  It doesn't do anything.
*29:27.980- 29:29.200* :  There's no wind.
*29:29.760- 29:30.360* :  There's no rain.
*29:30.360- 29:31.540* :  There's no weather.
*29:32.240- 29:33.480* :  There's no spurred song.
*29:33.480- 29:35.220* :  There's no crickets at night.
*29:35.840- 29:36.940* :  No thunderstorms.
*29:36.940- 29:38.880* :  There's nothing that would make you feel at home,
*29:38.900- 29:41.700* :  nothing that would make you feel like a place that you belong.
*29:41.700- 29:45.180* :  And I think it would be such a strange sensory experience
*29:45.940- 29:48.160* :  that I think people are really unprepared for that.
*29:48.500- 29:51.780* :  It's not just this passive sort of companion in the sky,
*29:51.780- 29:54.320* :  but it really has shaped all of human history,
*29:54.920- 29:56.700* :  all of evolution on this planet.
*29:57.280- 30:00.460* :  I think that it's very likely that animals would not have come onto the land
*30:00.460- 30:02.620* :  if they hadn't been dragged there by the tide,
*30:02.620- 30:03.980* :  which is controlled by the moon.
*30:04.460- 30:08.400* :  It has a profound effect on everything that's ever happened here.
*30:09.200- 30:09.960* :  Rebecca Boyle.
*30:10.480- 30:14.540* :  The singer, Zane Malik, who shot to fame as part of the boy band One Direction,

*31:11.720- 31:14.840* :  His father is a Pakistani immigrant to the UK.
*31:15.760- 31:17.980* :  The song was quick to gain fans online,
*31:17.980- 31:23.340* :  with some social media users urging Malik to release more Urdu songs, please.
*31:24.060- 31:27.980* :  The new version of the song has already been listened to three million times online,
*31:27.980- 31:33.120* :  and it's likely to surpass the original, which is currently sitting at 93 million.
*31:38.040- 31:43.200* :  Chantal Hartle, official Z Squad member, apparently that's what Zane fans call themselves.
*31:43.680- 31:44.160* :  Now you know.
