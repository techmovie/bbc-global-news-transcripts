*01:23.800- 01:25.960* :  I'm Andrew Patron in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:25.960- 01:28.440* :  the 14th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:29.020- 01:33.140* :  Donald Trump's former lawyer says he conspired to bury stories that would have harmed
*01:33.140- 01:36.000* :  the former president's 2016 election campaign.
*01:36.700- 01:41.020* :  People flee the Harkiv region in Northeastern Ukraine as Russian forces advance.
*01:43.660- 01:47.740* :  Also in this podcast, hundreds are killed by flash flooding in Northern Afghanistan.
*01:47.820- 01:52.680* :  After a few days, there could be a lot of spread of disease,
*01:53.080- 01:57.320* :  because the sanitation is not there as you sit in the infrastructure is not there.
*01:57.940- 02:00.040* :  And one of the world's most wanted people smugglers,
*02:00.040- 02:02.780* :  Barz and Majid, has been arrested in Northern Iraq.
*02:07.640- 02:11.780* :  Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York is now into its fifth week and on Monday,
*02:11.780- 02:15.460* :  the prosecution's main witness, Michael Cohen, began giving his evidence.
*02:15.580- 02:20.900* :  A confidence of the former US president, he once said that he would take a bullet for his former boss.
*02:20.900- 02:27.220* :  Mr Cohen paid off the porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence ahead of the 2016 election.
*02:27.760- 02:31.460* :  This was to stop her claiming she'd had sex with him 10 years earlier,
*02:31.680- 02:33.680* :  an allegation the former president denies.
*02:34.180- 02:38.420* :  He's on trial for falsifying business records when he reimbursed Mr Cohen,
*02:38.780- 02:40.500* :  which Mr Trump also denies.
*02:40.500- 02:45.260* :  The court heard a recording of a conversation the two men had about paying off another woman,
*02:45.600- 02:47.780* :  the former Playboy model Karen McDougall.
*03:06.260- 03:10.240* :  Mr Cohen has already served prison sentence for his part in the Stormy Daniels
*03:10.240- 03:12.160* :  Hush Money Affair, among other charges.
*03:12.620- 03:16.220* :  I've been talking to our correspondent at the trial in New York, Nettaurfic.
*03:39.660- 03:44.920* :  The deal with negative stories, telling him there's going to be a lot of women coming forward.
*03:44.940- 03:49.680* :  And on the scan, Michael Cohen said they eventually did and that Cohen himself
*03:49.680- 03:54.320* :  feared the Stormy Daniels story could be catastrophic to Trump's campaign.
*03:54.460- 03:59.220* :  And he said Trump was fuming at the time, telling him it was going to be a disaster,
*03:59.220- 04:02.640* :  a total disaster and that women were going to hate him.
*04:02.640- 04:08.740* :  Cohen says at that point, Donald Trump directed him just do it, make the payment.
*04:08.740- 04:13.760* :  So Cohen directly tying Donald Trump to the Hush Money payment.
*04:14.340- 04:20.060* :  And he says that he ultimately ended up being the one fronting the money because nobody else would.
*04:20.140- 04:27.400* :  But he said before he wired the $130,000 to Stormy Daniels lawyer that he called Donald Trump
*04:27.400- 04:32.740* :  to get his sign off and the court was actually shown two phone calls from Cohen to Trump
*04:33.240- 04:35.800* :  that morning before the wire was done.
*04:36.540- 04:39.620* :  And then we finally got to the questions that are at the heart of this case.
*04:40.340- 04:45.620* :  The Wade Cohen was reimbursed and whether the company falsified business records.
*04:45.620- 04:51.660* :  And Cohen testified that in front of Donald Trump, Weiselberg explained to him that he would be
*04:51.660- 04:57.820* :  paid in monthly installments and that those would be classified as a retainer for legal services.
*04:58.140- 05:01.620* :  This all feels familiar territory. Did we learn anything new?
*05:01.920- 05:07.340* :  I think what we learned new was a bit of what was Donald Trump's intent.
*05:07.520- 05:13.960* :  We heard in these kind of personal conversations how Donald Trump felt when the Stormy Daniels
*05:14.000- 05:20.200* :  story came out. If it was really about his family, Michael Cohen saying actually he wasn't worried
*05:20.200- 05:27.640* :  about Melania at all. It was all for the campaign. But very much so we are going over incidents
*05:27.640- 05:32.220* :  that have been reported time and time again. But nevertheless, it's incredibly important to
*05:32.220- 05:39.240* :  this case because jurors ultimately are using Michael Cohen's testimony along with the corroborating
*05:39.240- 05:46.140* :  evidence to decide if Trump had intent to defraud. And we're going to hear more from Michael Cohen.
*05:46.480- 05:50.400* :  We are. I mean, Michael Cohen could be on the stand for quite some time yet.
*05:50.400- 05:56.760* :  You know, we have gone through some key timelines, but prosecutors still have more questioning to do.
*05:56.760- 06:01.280* :  So we haven't even gotten to cross examination by Donald Trump's defense team yet.
*06:01.280- 06:09.080* :  And that is sure to be extremely intense because key to them making sure that Donald Trump
*06:09.540- 06:14.240* :  is either acquitted or, you know, they're going to we're getting a mistrial with at least one
*06:14.240- 06:19.560* :  juror being undecided. A key to that is trying to undermine Michael Cohen's credibility.
*06:19.560- 06:23.460* :  So no doubt they will spend as much time as they can doing that.
*06:24.000- 06:26.880* :  Neutrophic in New York next to Ukraine.
*06:36.440- 06:40.660* :  This is the sound of Russian shells landing just a few hundred meters away. As Ukrainian police
*06:40.660- 06:46.220* :  evacuate people from a village close to the front line in the northeast, these men were among those
*06:46.220- 06:50.440* :  who fled the latest Russian advance around Ukraine's second city, Harkiv.
*06:50.880- 06:58.400* :  I was in the house alone, and they opened fire at the door. They're sending me to the hospital in Karkiv.
*06:58.900- 07:00.520* :  I have no fingers. They're broken.
*07:03.280- 07:06.420* :  Half a kilometer away, there's fighting with automatic weapons.
*07:06.420- 07:11.740* :  Tanks are constantly approaching, shooting back and then leaving. I thought it would be okay.
*07:11.740- 07:17.780* :  I was shocked myself. I've been talking to our defense correspondent, Jonathan Biel, who's in Harkiv.
*07:18.420- 07:23.020* :  They've been conflicting reports. The Russians say they've entered the town of Bobchance,
*07:23.300- 07:29.440* :  which is probably the biggest most populated town near the Russian border. Most of the people
*07:29.440- 07:35.200* :  have already fled. Ukraine firmly denies that. In fact, the Governor of Harkiv region was
*07:35.820- 07:40.800* :  in Bobchance today, saying civilians the last remaining ones were being evacuated, not that
*07:40.800- 07:46.460* :  there are many left or many buildings intact. We spoke to some people who'd fled over the last 24
*07:46.460- 07:50.860* :  hours from that town, and they said they could hear heavy machine guns, which tells you the
*07:50.860- 07:57.000* :  fighting was very close. But I think the bigger issue has been Ukraine's defenses, and were they
*07:57.000- 08:02.400* :  up to it? I think those questions are being asked here. Some people saying that, yes, there were
*08:02.400- 08:06.960* :  defenses, but they weren't fortified enough. They were in the wrong place. The fact that one
*08:07.660- 08:12.660* :  senior Ukrainian commander in this region has been removed from his post. I think he tells you
*08:12.660- 08:17.680* :  essentially this wasn't meant to happen. I was going to say, but President Vladimir Zelensky has
*08:17.980- 08:23.240* :  confirmed this change of personnel in his TV address this evening. I mean, as you say, that's
*08:23.240- 08:29.060* :  like an admission that the thing is going badly. Things go back and forth in war, and both sides make
*08:29.060- 08:34.180* :  mistakes, and commanders get replaced, you know, Russia has just replaced the defense minister,
*08:34.220- 08:38.700* :  so I don't think we should read too much into that. But there's no doubt. Ukraine is being
*08:38.700- 08:45.600* :  probed right across this 800-mile front, and for a new front to open here in the carque of
*08:45.600- 08:51.000* :  region has made life very difficult for Ukraine. You are struggling with both manpower and ammunition
*08:51.000- 08:56.300* :  at the moment, waiting for that U.S. supplies, those U.S. supplies to start arriving in serious
*08:56.300- 09:02.600* :  quantities. But the one crime I've come for for Ukraine is so far in this war, neither side
*09:02.600- 09:09.180* :  have been able to completely breach each other's defenses. Yes, Ukraine's have crumbled
*09:09.180- 09:15.400* :  this year. Russia's made advances in some parts of the front, including here, but also in East,
*09:15.400- 09:21.720* :  but they have not yet the Ukrainian defenses completely collapsed. If we're whine right back to
*09:21.720- 09:27.320* :  the start of the conflict, everyone thought the Ukrainian military would be easily overwhelmed by
*09:27.320- 09:33.760* :  Russia's greater power and strength militarily. It's taken so much longer than anyone expected,
*09:33.760- 09:38.040* :  but is that basically what we're seeing now? Well, yeah, it has been a war of attrition. I think
*09:38.040- 09:43.560* :  the, you know, looking forward, it's, it's which side can keep recruiting the numbers of troops
*09:43.560- 09:49.540* :  they need. And remember, Russia has been essentially recruiting about 25 to 30,000 new troops
*09:49.580- 09:56.120* :  a month, but also the industrial capability. Now, Russia's been setting its own economy on a
*09:56.120- 10:01.400* :  war footing, and that's further confirmation by the removal of Sergei Shugo and being replaced by
*10:01.400- 10:07.420* :  somebody who's got an economics background. Whereas Ukraine is almost not completely, but very
*10:07.420- 10:11.620* :  reliant on the West and they're ramping up their production. And let's be honest, the West
*10:11.620- 10:17.020* :  has been very, very slow. So it's really who's going to outlast who? Russia has the bigger population,
*10:17.020- 10:23.100* :  it has a war economy. Ukraine has a smaller population. It's starting to mobilize more troops,
*10:23.700- 10:26.900* :  but it is reliant on the West to provide it with weapons and ammunition.
*10:27.700- 10:33.380* :  Now, from Joel Embiel in Harkiv to Memorial Day in Israel, when the country remembers its war
*10:33.380- 10:38.540* :  dead, it's meant to unify the country. But this year, Israel so divided over Gaza and the fate
*10:38.540- 10:43.440* :  of Israeli hostages, the day didn't pass off without trouble. Paul Adams is in Jerusalem.
*10:47.940- 10:53.360* :  At 11 this morning, sirens wailed over Israel for a minute, and life briefly came to a halt.
*10:53.820- 10:58.040* :  Israel is pausing to reflect on those who have died in the course of the country's turbulent
*10:58.040- 11:03.320* :  history. This year, already among the worst in living memory. At a ceremony in Jerusalem,
*11:03.320- 11:08.680* :  the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke not for the first time of an existential conflict
*11:08.680- 11:15.780* :  between Israel and its enemies. This is what the war is all about. It's either us, Israel,
*11:15.780- 11:22.300* :  or them, the Hamas, monsters, either continued existence, liberty, security and prosperity or
*11:22.300- 11:32.300* :  destruction, slaughter, rape and enslavement. Unity is in short supply this year. In Ash
*11:32.340- 11:36.820* :  Dodd, there was heckling and scuffles at a ceremony where the hard-line Minister of National
*11:36.820- 11:42.540* :  Security, Itamar Ben-Gavir, was speaking. In Tel Aviv, protesters held up placards,
*11:42.820- 11:47.700* :  saying the blood of Israeli hostages was on the government's hands. In the West Bank,
*11:47.700- 11:53.840* :  Israeli settlers once again blockaded an aid convoy, bound for Gaza, ransacking trucks at will,
*11:54.700- 11:58.940* :  and throwing food on the ground. Videos from the scene suggested that soldiers present
*11:58.940- 12:07.800* :  did nothing to intervene. In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, fighting return to the north,
*12:07.800- 12:13.300* :  with gunfire echoing through the streets of the Jabbalia refugee camp. Israel says it's seen
*12:13.300- 12:18.480* :  signs of Hamas regrouping there and has been forced to act. The US Secretary of State,
*12:18.480- 12:23.760* :  Antony Blinken, has warned that an all-out assault on Rafa in the south may simply provoke
*12:23.760- 12:30.540* :  anarchy without actually eliminating Hamas. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. It's been three days now
*12:30.540- 12:35.560* :  since northern Afghanistan was overwhelmed by flash flooding, killing more than 300 people.
*12:36.140- 12:40.560* :  Taliban officials have told the BBC that searching rescue operations will intensify,
*12:40.560- 12:46.080* :  for the number of dead or missing could rise significantly. The humanitarian organisation
*12:46.080- 12:50.580* :  saved the children, estimates that more than half a million people have been severely affected.
*12:51.160- 12:55.780* :  Yamabaraz, this from the BBC's Afghan service, has bowed to him as he made his way to
*12:55.780- 13:02.780* :  Bugland province, one of the worst hit areas. It is depressing. It is something which I personally
*13:02.780- 13:09.680* :  had seen in disaster movies, I would say, but the spirits was high. The official
*13:09.680- 13:16.620* :  which I spoke to, they seem optimistic. They say that the action from the international communities
*13:17.340- 13:23.420* :  promising, although the aid which has been promised, they are not all delivered yet. The people
*13:23.420- 13:30.360* :  in the affected areas, they are suffering a stall, they are looking for shelter, they are looking
*13:30.360- 13:38.400* :  for tents, food and they are asking the international community and Taliban authorities to do more.
*13:38.940- 13:44.860* :  Is the area in any way prepared for this kind of thing? Is flash flooding a normal thing
*13:45.460- 13:52.960* :  in northern Afghanistan? Not at all. Not only this area, about Afghanistan, the experts
*13:52.960- 13:59.940* :  said that it is one of those 10 countries which have been affected very badly by climate change
*14:00.520- 14:07.780* :  and one of those countries which is very purely equipped to deal with such a dire situation.
*14:08.500- 14:11.540* :  And do you get the sense that there is anyone there to help? You talked about
*14:11.540- 14:16.800* :  trying to get aid to people. You mentioned the authorities. Is there anyone there
*14:16.800- 14:21.500* :  or able to offer any assistance to the people caught up in this? From the international community,
*14:21.500- 14:27.320* :  the members of the UN, the NWFP and other organizations, they are on the ground.
*14:28.020- 14:32.300* :  There are people that you can see that they are trying to help, but the aid is not enough.
*14:32.300- 14:38.280* :  The roots are closed, the roots are destroyed. So the aid cannot be effectively delivered.
*14:38.820- 14:45.860* :  So obviously the concerns about food, about sanitation is got a basic human needs, won't be there
*14:45.860- 14:51.360* :  for the people who have lost their homes. That's the matter of concern for a lot of people because
*14:52.020- 14:57.920* :  they are saying that after a few days there could be a lot of spread of disease because
*14:57.920- 15:04.540* :  this sanitation is not there as you see the infrastructure is not there. So yes, the situation
*15:04.540- 15:12.760* :  is dire, but from the international community as well as local people from around other promises,
*15:12.860- 15:18.400* :  it seems that the response is huge. Yamabara is from the BBC's Afghan Service.
*15:21.140- 15:26.460* :  Still to come in this podcast? We think that the operator theater
*15:27.060- 15:32.380* :  will be a place for everyone, not only a place for our elite.

*17:22.880- 17:27.680* :  It featured TV footage showing the accused repeatedly kicking and punching his wife
*17:27.680- 17:33.580* :  and dragging her by the hair near naked into a room where she later died. A few hours ago,
*17:33.580- 17:36.580* :  the case ended with a former economy minister of Kazakhstan,
*17:36.580- 17:42.460* :  Kanduk Bishinbaya, being found guilty of murder. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison.
*17:43.040- 17:47.060* :  The accused man was a member of Kazakhstan's elite. Therefore, this case has prompted
*17:47.060- 17:51.800* :  much soul-searching. I've been talking to our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhard,
*17:52.120- 17:55.380* :  and started by asking him to tell me more about Kanduk Bishinbaya.
*17:56.100- 18:01.860* :  To 44-year-old businessman, he was briefly the economy minister. He was someone who's actually
*18:01.860- 18:07.700* :  had a previous conviction of embezzlement and given a 10-year sentence but was freed with an
*18:07.700- 18:14.440* :  amnesty on that front. Obviously, a significant and wealthy person, so a member of Kazakhstan's elite.
*18:14.920- 18:20.240* :  Okay, and context is everything with these kind of stories and cases. In Kazakhstan, domestic
*18:20.240- 18:25.500* :  violence is a huge thing. It absolutely is, and it's been a major problem. So, according to
*18:25.500- 18:32.840* :  official statistics, about 80 women are killed every year. But a UN backstudied from a few years
*18:32.840- 18:38.480* :  ago, said the real figure is probably about 400 deaths a year. And even that may well be
*18:38.480- 18:45.160* :  an underestimate because lots of these crimes go unreported. So, it's a serious problem,
*18:45.160- 18:50.900* :  not just in Kazakhstan, not just Central Asia, either. But it's something that the UN is trying
*18:50.900- 18:56.520* :  to tackle. It's one of the UN's sustainable development goals to eliminate all violence against
*18:56.520- 19:02.180* :  women and girls, both in the private and public sphere. And it's something that the President
*19:02.180- 19:08.320* :  Kasim Sharmaat-Tukayev has also promised to take action on. He has promised a fair and more
*19:08.320- 19:14.100* :  equitable society. And often the way when you get the attention on the issue through a high
*19:14.100- 19:18.880* :  profile case like this, that the government is pressured to do more than it might otherwise do.
*19:19.760- 19:26.700* :  This is very much the case in this trial. The killing of Sultana Nukienova in November
*19:26.700- 19:32.920* :  really captured the attention of Kazakhstan. And the trial, of course, being streamed live
*19:33.440- 19:38.980* :  has really turned into a test case, both of the authorities' willingness to clamp down on
*19:38.980- 19:45.200* :  these abuses and also to tackle the problem of impunity in the elite. But it's one thing, of course,
*19:45.600- 19:51.880* :  bringing a very high profile figure to justice in this case, sentencing him to 24 years and a
*19:51.880- 19:57.720* :  maximum security prison. But it's another thing, of course, to have a consistent approach that
*19:57.720- 20:05.360* :  lasts over years. So in terms of enforcing laws consistently, training prosecutors, the judiciary,
*20:05.360- 20:11.060* :  law enforcement, and also raising awareness more broadly from schools upwards.
*20:11.320- 20:13.400* :  And seeing that at all levels of society as well?
*20:13.760- 20:19.780* :  Absolutely. So for a long time, Kazakhstan's political elite was seem to be untouchable.
*20:20.240- 20:25.220* :  From that perspective, it's definitely a test case. But it's really what happens in the years ahead
*20:25.220- 20:31.460* :  that matter. Now, the trial, one thing it did do, it prompted new legislation on this front.
*20:31.500- 20:36.800* :  So a month ago, the president signed into law measures to criminalize domestic violence,
*20:37.360- 20:43.000* :  which previously had not been the case. That was the sense that domestic abuse, if it was
*20:43.460- 20:49.760* :  deemed to be minor, was largely people were let off or given small fines and things like this.
*20:49.760- 20:55.320* :  So there is a change in the law that came while this case was actually being heard.
*20:55.720- 21:00.540* :  Are you at regional editor, Danny Eberhard reporting? A man who was pulled from the rubble of a
*21:00.540- 21:06.160* :  building in South Africa, almost 30 hours after it collapsed, has told the BBC of the hell he
*21:06.160- 21:11.860* :  experienced. I mean, its silence was held on Monday to mark a week since almost 30 people died
*21:11.860- 21:16.620* :  and more than 80 were trapped in the city of George. A correspondent in Johannesburg,
*21:16.620- 21:20.400* :  Xinganyaka, spoke to the survivor in his first broadcast interview.
*21:21.140- 21:25.500* :  Delvin Saifers, who was a 29-year-old electrician, is counting himself lucky.
*21:26.100- 21:31.460* :  Last Monday, just after 2pm, he was on the third floor of a five-story building with a colleague
*21:31.460- 21:37.020* :  when the building completely gave way, trapping him in the debris. It was more than a full day
*21:37.020- 21:42.300* :  after the building's collapse that rescuers pulled him from the rubble. He was taken to hospital
*21:42.300- 21:47.040* :  with a broken rib. He told the BBC what it was like as he waited to be found.
*21:47.580- 21:55.260* :  It was terrible, it was like hell. Because I was lay on top of broken concrete pieces for 28 hours
*21:56.040- 22:02.720* :  and I couldn't really move my arms, my shoulders, my legs, everything was shaking in pain.
*22:02.720- 22:04.240* :  I'm not going to make it.
*22:04.440- 22:08.680* :  Rescue teams have worked tirelessly since the building collapsed to find survivors.
*22:09.300- 22:14.420* :  81 people, mostly construction workers like Delvin Saifers, were on site at the time.
*22:14.920- 22:17.840* :  Almost 30 of his colleagues are now confirmed to have died.
*22:17.840- 22:23.580* :  Around two dozen more are still missing. Some relatives have expressed frustration at the pace
*22:23.580- 22:29.600* :  of the identification of their loved ones. Over the weekend, a man was rescued alive after five days,
*22:29.600- 22:35.620* :  in what the Western Kate Provincial Premier Alan Wind called a miracle we've all been hoping for.
*22:36.160- 22:41.500* :  And while chances of survival are fading, Delvin Saifers is still hopeful more of his colleagues
*22:41.500- 22:42.620* :  will be found alive.
*23:14.300- 23:19.140* :  The people who've signed this letter, they're all part of the inter-parliamentary alliance on China.
*23:19.380- 23:24.240* :  They're saying, look, we have been cited in dozens of pieces of evidence that have been submitted
*23:24.240- 23:30.480* :  to court. They've been called witnesses or accomplices to this alleged crime, but they themselves
*23:30.480- 23:35.540* :  have never been contacted by the prosecutors. And so they're saying, look, we would like to testify
*23:35.540- 23:42.120* :  on our own behalf. We are credible witnesses. We're all elected lawmakers or formerly elected lawmakers.
*23:42.120- 23:47.380* :  And so you should call us to this end. You should want to speak to us because we can help shed light
*23:47.380- 23:48.580* :  on what's going on.
*23:48.700- 23:52.020* :  Pretty embarrassing for the Chinese authorities to have people saying,
*23:52.600- 23:53.660* :  please let us testify.
*23:53.920- 23:59.540* :  Absolutely. These are quite well-respected lawmakers from Japan, Germany, France, Canada and the UK.
*23:59.540- 24:04.940* :  And so it's quite embarrassing for especially the Hong Kong authorities who are still
*24:04.940- 24:12.780* :  trying to show that Jimmy Laihi is being tried in a free and fair court. And so the lawmakers
*24:12.780- 24:18.140* :  essentially are calling their bluff on this to say, look, if this really is the kind of trial
*24:18.140- 24:22.880* :  that you say it is, then you should want to speak to us. And look, we're putting ourselves forward.
*24:23.240- 24:29.400* :  In China across Asia, the concept of saving face in any situation is so culturally powerful.
*24:29.880- 24:33.400* :  How do the Chinese authorities get out of this situation and save face?
*24:34.100- 24:38.700* :  That's a really good question. I mean, I'll be shocked if these people are actually called to
*24:38.700- 24:43.780* :  testify because they'll be given such a massive platform under which they can really boost
*24:43.780- 24:50.560* :  Jimmy Laihi's case. How will the Hong Kong authorities argue away this offer? I think they might
*24:50.560- 24:54.920* :  say, look, we have written submissions. We have all the evidence we need. Thank you very much.
*24:55.020- 24:59.880* :  But the trial is quite far gone. We're working way through it very quickly. And we would like to
*24:59.880- 25:04.020* :  just press ahead. We have not heard from the Department of Justice yet. A letter was submitted
*25:04.020- 25:10.020* :  to them today from the inter-parliamentary alliance on China. And so we will hear, I will also add
*25:10.020- 25:14.980* :  that the inter-parliamentary alliance on China is very unpopular with China's communist leaders.
*25:14.980- 25:19.980* :  They have called them anti-China before. Now, this is a group of lawmakers from around the world.
*25:19.980- 25:26.420* :  And it includes people like the US Senator Marco Rubio, the former British Prime Minister Liz Tross,
*25:26.420- 25:32.840* :  people who really have built political careers on criticizing China. So I don't think that the
*25:32.840- 25:38.460* :  Hong Kong courts will be eager to allow members of this group to testify in a Hong Kong court.
*25:38.660- 25:41.820* :  It's hard to imagine a letter that could have arrived today that would have annoyed them more,
*25:41.820- 25:47.160* :  in fact. Exactly. So it'll be fascinating to see what they say in response.
*25:47.820- 25:53.240* :  Ah, Asia Pacific Editor Celia Hatton with me. A German high court has upheld a ruling that
*25:53.240- 25:59.260* :  the intelligence services can investigate the far-right AFD party as a suspected extremist
*25:59.260- 26:05.020* :  organisation. The German security agency argued that the statements made by party members were
*26:05.020- 26:10.240* :  evidence of extremism. But the AFD said the comments didn't represent it as a whole.
*26:10.240- 26:15.780* :  The ruling could undermine support for the AFD in upcoming elections, as our correspondent in
*26:15.780- 26:21.980* :  Berlin, David McGillis explains. Today's court decision means that German intelligence can monitor
*26:21.980- 26:27.900* :  the party's activities and communications. This may put off wavering voters in the upcoming
*26:27.900- 26:34.380* :  European Parliament elections and in key regional elections in September in eastern Germany,
*26:34.880- 26:39.660* :  where the AFD is doing well in the polls. The ruling, though, will certainly give a boost to
*26:39.660- 26:45.620* :  those calling for the party to be banned. The legal hurdles for that are high, but even the debate
*26:45.620- 26:51.760* :  around a ban is not something AFD leaders want. Although the party has become more radical over the
*26:51.760- 26:57.840* :  years, it's also trying to detoxify in order to one day have a chance of getting into government.
*26:57.840- 27:02.740* :  One of Europe's most wanted people-smugglers, nicknamed the Scorpion, has been arrested in
*27:02.740- 27:08.700* :  Soleimania in northern Iraq. He was detained on Sunday by a local Kurdish forces. Last week,
*27:08.700- 27:13.040* :  the BBC tracked down and confronted Basem Majid, who's been on the run for more than 12
*27:13.040- 27:17.960* :  months. Sue Mitchell, the BBC journalist, made a podcast about the search, and she spoke to
*27:17.960- 27:22.680* :  my colleague Matthew M. Rowley-Walla. The events have moved really rapidly after the transmission
*27:22.680- 27:27.960* :  of the podcast. The Iraqi authorities immediately got in touch with us and said, what evidence can we
*27:27.960- 27:31.960* :  provide to them? We've had communication with them and with the National Crime Agency here in
*27:31.960- 27:39.140* :  Britain, and this morning at 7 a.m., they sent police forces out to arrest Basem Majid in Iraq,
*27:39.140- 27:45.300* :  in Soleimania, in the north of Iraq. As far as we know, he's now been held in detention,
*27:45.960- 27:50.620* :  and there is great interest, but with police forces across Britain and in Belgium,
*27:50.620- 27:57.000* :  waiting to find out what terms for extradition might be. That is such a development, because,
*27:57.000- 28:02.420* :  of course, police forces have been searching for this man, and it took your investigation to find
*28:02.420- 28:06.380* :  him. When you tracked him down, what did he actually say to you? Yeah, it was quite amazing
*28:06.380- 28:10.860* :  to actually find him, really, and the search had taken us through Europe into Turkey and then
*28:10.860- 28:17.580* :  Iraq. When we finally confronted him with his crimes, he admitted smuggling 10,000 or more people
*28:17.580- 28:22.900* :  into Britain. He said he couldn't remember how many. He was very blasé about the dangers and the
*28:22.900- 28:28.460* :  risks on his crossings have been instants of great injury. He was blaming the migrants themselves,
*28:29.080- 28:33.980* :  saying they knew those risks when they went into these small boats. He really said that he was
*28:33.980- 28:38.400* :  doing this job because people begged him to get them to the UK. As far as he was concerned,
*28:38.400- 28:43.660* :  he saw himself not really doing anything wrong. He has been in hiding, and obviously he never
*28:43.660- 28:49.760* :  thought we would find him, so he was very surprised and must be really baffled by recent developments
*28:49.760- 28:55.680* :  today. Just take us through what is likely to happen next. Our suspect is a very fluid situation,
*28:55.720- 28:59.780* :  but, of course, he's wanted in several different countries. So, do we have any iceful of idea
*28:59.780- 29:04.880* :  where he is going to go end up? Well, I was speaking to the Iraqi authorities just in the last hour,
*29:05.300- 29:10.380* :  and they are very, very keen to start questioning themselves. They've got instances they want
*29:10.380- 29:13.760* :  to put to him. Then they're liaising, obviously, with Britain and with Belgium.
*29:14.320- 29:19.200* :  Police forces in other countries as well want to have input into what's going to happen to him next.
*29:19.620- 29:23.080* :  As we understand it, he'll be in Iraq for some time now, while he's questioned in detail
*29:23.080- 29:26.860* :  by authorities there, and they're going to keep us abreast of developments. For them,
*29:26.860- 29:31.760* :  they see it as highlighting a real step forward, and dealing with smugglers at this kind of level,
*29:31.760- 29:37.040* :  at this top level. For more search for the podcast to catch a scorpion available wherever you get

*29:43.900- 29:49.780* :  in Rome in Italy. The children aged between 8 and 10 were able to sing, dance, make costumes,
*29:49.780- 29:55.060* :  and watch rehearsals as part of an initiative to make opera more accessible to younger audiences.
*29:55.720- 29:59.760* :  The general manager of the opera house, Francesco Gianbroney, spoke to Tim Franks.
*30:00.440- 30:10.300* :  It's a special idea from an Italian theater because we think that the opera theater will be a
*30:10.300- 30:21.680* :  place for everyone, not only a place for an elite. So we decided to invite 130 young people
*30:22.520- 30:33.380* :  to sleep in the theater, to live in the theater, to fell on in the theater, and was very exciting
*30:33.940- 30:40.400* :  for us and also for the young people. So what did they do other than just sleep in the theater,
*30:40.400- 30:45.880* :  which I'm sure must have been a thrill in its own way? What sorts of things did they see and hear?
*30:46.480- 30:55.620* :  Oh, they did a lot of activities. The first thing was to attend a rehearsal of our orchestra and choir
*30:55.620- 31:05.000* :  conducted by our musical director Michele Mariotti and was incredible, the silence of these young
*31:05.020- 31:14.800* :  people during the rehearsals. And then they visited the theater, they had guided tour of the theater
*31:14.800- 31:21.160* :  to discover the phantom. You have a ghost? Yes, a ghost. Oh my goodness me.
*31:21.160- 31:26.500* :  God must have been terrifying for the children. No, no, no, no. He's a good one.
*31:26.500- 31:32.720* :  He's a good one. Ah, it's a friend. Yes, she is a singer. She was in the past, the general manager
*31:32.720- 31:39.720* :  of the theater. I mean, all this sounds totally wonderful. Did they actually get to see any opera?
*31:40.300- 31:48.580* :  For most of them was the first time at the theater costumes, the first time in an opera theater.
*31:48.900- 31:58.940* :  But we have a lot of educational program for the school, for the for children. We have some hope
*31:58.940- 32:08.580* :  that in the future these 130 children could be a part of our audience. I wonder whether you think
*32:08.580- 32:15.720* :  that Italy has a special responsibility to educate its children because you have such a magnificent
*32:15.740- 32:24.620* :  tradition in opera? Yes, this is true, but this is a general problem. But it's true. Italy has more
*32:24.620- 32:32.540* :  responsibilities because Melodrama was born in Italy. But we are doing a lot because we have a good
*32:32.540- 32:44.720* :  percentage of young people in our audience. And because our audience is more than 90% of
*32:45.640- 32:51.160* :  occupation of the theater. Francesco Gianbroni of the Opera House in Rome.
