*01:24.520- 01:29.220* :  I'm Andrew Peachan and the early hours of Saturday the 4th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:29.920- 01:35.100* :  Canadian Police charged three Indian nationals over the killing of a Sikh activist last year.
*01:35.920- 01:41.200* :  Egyptian mediators say Israel's given Hamas a week to accept its current cease-fire deal
*01:41.640- 01:43.720* :  or face an Israeli offensive on Raffa.
*01:44.380- 01:49.240* :  The Nigerian army says two officers at a face trial for last year's bombing of a village
*01:49.240- 01:55.160* :  set to have killed over 100 people and also in this podcast.
*01:55.180- 02:01.400* :  This is bad news, not just for the world of bullfighting but also for the democracy and freedom
*02:01.400- 02:06.160* :  of expression in this country. Why Spain is abolishing a national bullfighting price?
*02:10.260- 02:14.800* :  Canadian Police have arrested and charged three Indian nationals in connection with the killing
*02:14.800- 02:18.180* :  of a prominent Sikh separatist leader in the suburb of Vancouver.
*02:18.760- 02:23.180* :  Hardeeb Singh Nijar was shot dead by a mask government in a car park as he was leading a Sikh
*02:23.180- 02:28.300* :  temple last June. Superintendent Mandi Mukher told journalists how they'd got to this point.
*02:28.960- 02:33.360* :  Through complex investigative techniques and tremendous support from the community,
*02:34.020- 02:40.480* :  we were able to gather significant evidence that led us to the individuals that were responsible
*02:40.480- 02:46.280* :  for this homicide. I'm here today to announce that we arrested and charged three individuals
*02:46.380- 02:53.100* :  for first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to Hardeeb Nijar's homicide.
*02:53.460- 02:55.660* :  Let's get more on this from our correspondent, Will Vernon.
*02:56.180- 03:00.880* :  Police called this a significant development in this investigation that's been going on for many
*03:00.880- 03:07.760* :  months now. There's been huge interest in this case. On Friday morning in Edmonton, police swooped
*03:07.760- 03:12.100* :  and arrested these three men in three separate locations around the city. All of them
*03:12.480- 03:17.300* :  Indian nationals in their 20s and they are now in custody and they've all been charged with
*03:17.300- 03:23.760* :  first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in connection with the killing of Hardeeb Singh Nijar.
*03:23.760- 03:27.720* :  Now there was a lot the police couldn't tell us today in that news conference because they said
*03:28.120- 03:32.840* :  the investigation is still ongoing but they did say that they're investigating potential links
*03:33.500- 03:37.860* :  that these men have with the Indian authorities and that's the really really interesting bit.
*03:38.540- 03:46.000* :  He was a prominent Sikh leader well-known in the community. He was a Sikh separatist, a supporter
*03:46.000- 03:52.440* :  of something that's known as Halistan which is an independent Sikh state within India. He moved
*03:52.440- 03:58.920* :  to Canada in 1997. He married there, had two sons, worked as a plumber and he was known locally
*03:58.920- 04:06.820* :  as a vocal advocate for this Halistan state. The Sikhs are a religious minority, 2% of India's
*04:06.820- 04:11.760* :  population. He'd been branded a terrorist by the Indian authorities and his friends said that
*04:12.120- 04:17.340* :  before his killing he'd received warnings that he was on a hit list and he was murdered in the
*04:17.340- 04:23.540* :  car park of a Sikh temple in June last year in the Canadian city of Suri near Vancouver. He was
*04:23.540- 04:30.920* :  getting into his car when two men shot him and he died at the scene. Last year following that killing
*04:30.920- 04:36.340* :  Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian authorities were involved
*04:36.340- 04:42.360* :  in the murder that was denied by Delhi who then accused Canada of giving shelter to extremists
*04:42.400- 04:48.260* :  and that resulted in a diplomatic rift between Ottawa and Delhi at there were expulsions of diplomats
*04:48.260- 04:54.160* :  lots of angry words. Of course that was the main question that everyone wanted to know today in
*04:54.160- 04:58.960* :  that news conference that the police held when they announced the arrest of these three men what
*04:58.960- 05:04.520* :  if any is the link with the Indian authorities now they wouldn't say very much at all. They said
*05:04.520- 05:09.160* :  that they're investigating the potential links they're working with other agencies including
*05:09.160- 05:13.960* :  foreign intelligence to try and get to the truth about whether India was involved.
*05:13.960- 05:19.920* :  That was Will Vernon reporting. For weeks it was a question of when not if Israel would
*05:19.920- 05:25.320* :  begin an offensive against Hamas in Raffa. Now Egyptian mediators have told the Wall Street
*05:25.320- 05:30.300* :  Journal that the government in Jerusalem has given Hamas one week to agree to a cease fire and
*05:30.300- 05:35.460* :  the release of the remaining hostages or face that onslaught. Hamas is apparently looking at the
*05:35.460- 05:40.320* :  proposal. I've been talking to our Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher. This is a process that's
*05:40.320- 05:46.260* :  been going on for months. Where we are at the moment it seems more positive again in the
*05:46.260- 05:52.240* :  signs that are coming out. A few days ago there were meetings between the Israeli delegation
*05:52.240- 05:59.400* :  and particularly Egyptian mediators and from that it seems that a modified proposal of some sort
*05:59.420- 06:08.020* :  has been arrived at. That is a slight compromise from Israel from where it stood before. It had been
*06:08.020- 06:15.560* :  saying that 40 prisoners, 40 women, the sick and the elderly of those still held in Gaza should
*06:15.560- 06:22.340* :  be released in the first batch to go with a cease fire. That didn't really get anywhere. I think
*06:22.340- 06:27.720* :  mainly because Hamas doesn't actually believe that there's that number who fit that category
*06:27.720- 06:34.060* :  still alive in Gaza. So now the number appears to have gone down to 33. The period for the cease
*06:34.100- 06:43.760* :  fire 40 days, the issue is still over what Israel is saying that it will continue whether there's a
*06:43.760- 06:47.940* :  cease fire or not, whether there's a hostile or not, whether it's planned offensive in Raffa,
*06:47.940- 06:52.920* :  the southernmost town in Gaza. That's on one side. On the other side you have Hamas which
*06:52.920- 06:57.740* :  has publicly still been saying that one of its main conditions is that it needs to be a permanent
*06:57.740- 07:04.360* :  cease fire, not a temporary one. But we have been hearing some indications that there may be
*07:04.360- 07:10.740* :  some move from the Hamas side as well and we've heard now that the Hamas delegation will go to
*07:10.740- 07:17.300* :  Cairo on Saturday and will we believe present its written response to this latest proposal.
*07:17.300- 07:24.780* :  A Hamas official has been speaking Hossam Badran and he said that Hamas has been looking at this
*07:24.780- 07:30.420* :  with a positive spirit. So there are some hopes that are rising yet but we have been here before
*07:30.420- 07:34.360* :  and it hasn't led anywhere so you know I think everyone is remaining very cautious.
*07:34.660- 07:39.860* :  The fact that hostages are being held for so long is clearly horrific for them and their families
*07:39.860- 07:47.020* :  back home but why would Hamas be tempted to release the hostages when by doing so they'd lose all
*07:47.020- 07:52.720* :  their bargaining power? The deal that stands at the moment would not be for the full number of hostages
*07:52.720- 07:57.780* :  to be released. Israel and parts of Israeli government have been saying there's no point in
*07:57.780- 08:03.940* :  doing a partial deal. There's no point in receiving 33 hostages because there may never be another
*08:03.940- 08:08.620* :  deal so they may not be able to get anyone else out. From a Hamas side as you're saying as the
*08:08.620- 08:13.820* :  deal stands amount they wouldn't be handing over all hostages but they hold so they would still have
*08:13.820- 08:21.200* :  those cards to play essentially in negotiation and in return not just for cease fire but also a large
*08:21.200- 08:24.900* :  number of Palestinian prisoners would be released and I think for Hamas that would be particularly
*08:24.900- 08:31.860* :  important. I'm at least analyst Sebastian Asher. In December last year at least 120 people, many
*08:31.860- 08:36.960* :  of them children were killed when a drone hit a village in Kuduna State in northern Nigeria.
*08:37.700- 08:42.360* :  At the time the army said they'd mistaken them for terrorists. President Bollatinibu
*08:42.360- 08:48.200* :  described the tragedy as a bombing mishap. Well now two army officers are to go on trial for
*08:48.200- 08:53.900* :  their deaths. I've been talking to our correspondent in Nigeria Chris Awako. Well December last
*08:53.900- 09:01.580* :  year the Nigerian army carried out an air strike in Kuduna State in northwest Nigeria and
*09:01.580- 09:08.160* :  basically after the air strike over a hundred people were left dead and this was in a village.
*09:08.840- 09:14.700* :  So there was an outcry from members of the community to say hey the Nigerian government and
*09:14.700- 09:19.800* :  its agencies are targeting us and are killing our people. The military came out with a statement
*09:19.860- 09:25.360* :  to say that they were targeting bandits and other members of jihadist group but they
*09:25.360- 09:31.860* :  cries from the community were persistent and some investigations carried out also indicated but
*09:32.460- 09:39.420* :  basically some civilian villagers were killed and so when the information got out the military went
*09:39.420- 09:45.540* :  back into investigating their own and discovered that indeed they had made a blunder a mistake.
*09:46.060- 09:52.200* :  So the people who were directing the drone the army officers who were in charge clearly made a
*09:52.200- 09:58.320* :  terrible mistake and are now being put on trial. Exactly so before an air strike is carried out
*09:58.780- 10:05.620* :  what we understand is that the military ought to do a kind of reconnaissance do their investigation
*10:06.500- 10:12.740* :  recheck to confirm before they get the order to strike and apparently the information they got
*10:12.740- 10:18.980* :  passed to the higher command before they got a great light to strike was not correct and so it seems
*10:18.980- 10:23.600* :  that the officers who are responsible for those information going to be put on trial.
*10:24.080- 10:30.160* :  So Chris this is like a military court marshal to determine whether or not the officers were
*10:30.160- 10:36.320* :  negligent or not in what they did. Yes the officers will be subjected to a military trial and
*10:36.380- 10:43.480* :  if they found capable they will be dismissed from the army and probably be now subjected to a kind
*10:43.480- 10:49.260* :  of civil prosecution in a law court but again sometimes because they are military officers
*10:49.640- 10:56.320* :  they are also consents about fairness for them and then people are also asking if the military
*10:56.320- 11:03.480* :  authorities are not just skip-goating these officers as a way of asswaging the anger of the
*11:03.480- 11:08.300* :  people of the community and international partners. Because it's obviously in the interests of the
*11:08.300- 11:14.720* :  government and President Tinibu to calm things down and to bring some closure to the story I suppose.
*11:15.220- 11:20.860* :  Clearly yes the government is keen to show to the international community to the outside world
*11:20.860- 11:26.920* :  that Nigeria government and its agency is especially the military law abiding and they carry out
*11:26.920- 11:33.840* :  the operations and engagements according to the law. Chris a walker in Nigeria as heavy rainfall
*11:33.840- 11:39.340* :  continues to pound East Africa the president of Kenya William Ruto is warning his country could
*11:39.340- 11:45.900* :  experience its first ever cyclone he said more than 200 people have died so far in flooding and
*11:45.900- 11:53.220* :  mudslides he is Richard Hamilton. Cyclone Hidaya is gaining momentum as it travels along the
*11:53.220- 11:59.700* :  coast of Tanzania it's expected to make landfall this weekend and veer towards the biggest
*11:59.700- 12:07.400* :  city of Dara Salam. In a televised address President William Ruto said the cyclone could hit Kenya
*12:07.400- 12:14.680* :  at any time already 200,000 people have been affected by the flooding but President Ruto
*12:14.680- 12:23.180* :  predicted that things will get even worse. Metro Ruto reports paint a dire picture the rains will
*12:23.180- 12:31.740* :  persist increasing both intuition and intensity for the rest of this month Kenya may face its
*12:31.740- 12:41.440* :  first ever cyclone this cyclone named Hidaya could hit anytime and is predicted to cause torrential
*12:41.440- 12:48.100* :  rain strong winds and powerful and dangerous waves which could potentially disrupt marine
*12:48.100- 12:55.000* :  activities in the Indian Ocean and settlement along the Kenyan coast. He's also ordered the
*12:55.000- 13:02.680* :  evacuation of those in flood prone areas in the villages near the town of Mai Mahu southwest of
*13:02.680- 13:09.660* :  Nairobi more than 50 people were swept away by floodwaters as they slept among them were the two
*13:09.660- 13:24.280* :  sons of 87-year-old Grishon White Ganjo. I heard the sound of the water flowing down. I was in
*13:24.280- 13:30.680* :  the house with my wife my grandchild and great-grandchild. I told them to wake up and I said there was
*13:30.680- 13:37.220* :  a flood coming. It came here it didn't take three minutes this whole compound was flooded
*13:37.220- 13:43.800* :  and water started filling our home this is our son's house and the one who was swept away lived
*13:43.800- 13:50.420* :  behind this house we stayed in the house and prayed and said God you said you wouldn't destroy
*13:50.420- 13:57.180* :  people with waters or flood again please help us. President Ruto has also ordered schools to be
*13:57.180- 14:03.700* :  closed indefinitely and urged the local authorities to reconstruct schools that have been damaged
*14:03.700- 14:11.940* :  or destroyed nearly 180 dams and reservoirs have been identified as being at high risk of overflowing
*14:11.940- 14:18.940* :  with water levels of some of the dams at historic levels. The government says more than 100
*14:18.940- 14:27.580* :  refugee camps have now been set up to provide shelter for nearly 30,000 people. Meanwhile a heatwave
*14:27.580- 14:32.700* :  in the Philippines has forced schools to close amid temperatures described by the government as
*14:32.700- 14:38.060* :  dangerous. Antonia Uloizaga is head of the government department of the environment and natural
*14:38.580- 14:42.720* :  resources in the Philippines. She's been talking to my colleague Paul Henley about how people are
*14:42.720- 14:48.840* :  coping. In the heart of the city it is scorching hot. We do have a lot of concrete as you may
*14:48.840- 14:55.160* :  imagine in terms of this highly urbanized areas but over in the rural areas as well the heat index
*14:55.160- 15:01.220* :  is hitting in the forties and we already have warnings of course in terms of the dangerous
*15:01.260- 15:06.940* :  levels of heat. And the heat index is higher than the actual temperature it takes into account the
*15:06.940- 15:12.560* :  humidity and how the body feels the heat. Is that right? That's right and so we have a heat index
*15:12.560- 15:22.480* :  ranging from over 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. Some areas Celsius yes and 48 are highest in fact in
*15:22.480- 15:28.920* :  terms of the heat index happened in in April 28 where we had one area which is the symbolic area
*15:28.920- 15:37.100* :  hitting 53. In terms of how you feel the heat as an individual what is the sensation? I know the
*15:37.100- 15:42.480* :  demand for those who are lucky enough to have air conditioning systems is huge putting a strain on
*15:42.480- 15:49.200* :  the system. How badly do you need aircon in these temperatures? Well absolutely necessary in terms
*15:49.200- 15:54.820* :  of the need for air conditioning but we all know that affordability is a challenge and therefore
*15:54.820- 16:00.780* :  out on the street especially for those that do service deliveries for example it is punishing
*16:01.940- 16:08.660* :  and the sensation on your skin feels almost like you know you're pretty close to to to burning out.
*16:09.320- 16:15.940* :  To an extent you'll have anticipated this heat what sort of adaptations mitigations have been made
*16:15.940- 16:24.580* :  by the government? Well in terms of adaptation certainly in the sectors agriculture is among the
*16:24.580- 16:30.880* :  first sectors that that needed to adapt and we're now exploring different ways of planting our
*16:30.880- 16:37.520* :  staple which is rice and of course exploring very climate resilient crops. In the water sector
*16:37.900- 16:44.580* :  we have been working for some time on planning our integrated water resources management systems
*16:45.360- 16:52.820* :  and anticipating how there can be for example the possibility of small desalination facilities for
*16:52.820- 16:58.660* :  isolated islands which which hard they have any water anyway. And that was Antonia Yulo
*16:58.660- 17:03.060* :  Loizaga ahead of the government department of the environment and natural resources in the Philippines.
*17:04.020- 17:09.100* :  It's only lasted for a decade now the national prize for ball fighting in Spain is being abolished.
*17:09.520- 17:14.600* :  It's a decision made by the culture minister Ernest Otasana of the left wing Catalonia in common
*17:14.600- 17:20.420* :  party which forms part of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's governing coalition. Aficionados of ball
*17:20.420- 17:24.520* :  fighting have criticized it the president of the biggest ball fighting organization
*17:24.520- 17:32.180* :  Victoriano Martín said the reasons were political. This is bad news not just for the world
*17:32.180- 17:36.860* :  of ball fighting but also for the democracy and freedom of expression in this country.
*17:37.020- 17:43.460* :  It's cultural censorship for ideological reasons. I found out more from my Europe regional
*17:43.460- 17:49.260* :  editor Danny Aberhardt. Well Ernest Otasana there said public money shouldn't be used as a reward
*17:49.340- 17:57.120* :  what is animal abuse. The prize was $32,000. He said the majority of Spanish people don't agree
*17:57.120- 18:02.620* :  with the mistreatment of animals. He himself is a long-term opponent of ball fighting and he set
*18:02.620- 18:08.060* :  this in the context of a wider background of animal welfare legislation passed in 2023.
*18:08.660- 18:14.360* :  We know that ball fighting is part of Spanish culture. How popular is it now though?
*18:14.620- 18:22.360* :  Minister Otasana quoted statistics from 2021 to 2022 that said 1.9% only of the Spanish
*18:22.360- 18:27.620* :  population actually attended a ball fight. The picture is obviously more complex than that.
*18:27.620- 18:32.280* :  It's a very very polarizing issue so the people that do support it support it very very
*18:32.280- 18:37.580* :  passionately and they talk about it as being an art and they dismiss animal welfare saying that
*18:37.580- 18:43.320* :  the balls that ultimately meet a very gory end have a good life up to that point whereas other
*18:43.320- 18:49.280* :  people of course say it's a cruel barbaric sport that turns it makes a spectator sport of torture
*18:49.780- 18:56.040* :  and broadly across the nation opinion polls suggest that about 45% of Spanish people want to ban it
*18:56.440- 19:03.180* :  about 30% oppose a ban but they also don't want to subsidise it and about 24% of people want it
*19:03.180- 19:08.500* :  subsidised. Many countries have culture wars in their politics at the moment. Is that what this
*19:08.500- 19:15.320* :  is in Spain? This very much plays into that sort of thing Andrew so broadly it's not absolutely
*19:15.320- 19:19.760* :  monolithic but there's a broad left right divide on this. So right wing parties particularly the
*19:19.760- 19:27.560* :  far right party vox but also the popular the the centre right party want to either subsidise
*19:27.920- 19:33.200* :  or not ban it and the parties on the left want to ban it so that's the broad thing.
*19:33.480- 19:38.980* :  It is more complicated and there's also regional differences as well so for example the Canary
*19:38.980- 19:44.400* :  Islands ban bullfighting a long time ago and Catalonia banned it more than a decade ago so
*19:44.400- 19:50.000* :  these things aren't regional as well as party political. Are you a regional editor Danny Aberhard?
*19:52.760- 19:57.140* :  Still to come in this podcast? What we really want to show is how he actually lives with that
*19:57.140- 20:02.500* :  reputation while also facing the growing challenges of aging because he dies at the age of 88 but
*20:02.500- 20:07.720* :  quite remarkably he is working several days before he died. A new exhibition looking back at the
*20:07.720- 20:20.480* :  final years of the life of the artist Michelangelo. Want flexibility? Take yoga. Want flexibility

*21:08.520- 21:12.840* :  South Korea's foreign ministry has raised the alert level for its diplomatic missions in
*21:12.840- 21:18.700* :  several countries. It says it's received intelligence that North Korea may attempt to harm its officials
*21:18.700- 21:24.600* :  more from our correspondent in Seoul Jean McKenzie. This South Korea has raised the terror threat
*21:24.780- 21:30.580* :  at three of its embassies abroad so in Laos Cambodia and Vietnam and also at two of its
*21:30.580- 21:36.000* :  consulates so in Russia and China. What they are saying is that they have intelligence that North
*21:36.000- 21:40.660* :  Korea has sent operatives to these five countries and that those operatives are now planning
*21:40.660- 21:46.960* :  attacks either on its embassies or on its diplomatic staff but we don't know any more about what
*21:46.960- 21:51.700* :  these planned attacks were, what form that they would take. What we do know though is that these five
*21:51.700- 21:57.180* :  countries all have very good relations with North Korea and so it means that their operatives in
*21:57.180- 22:02.320* :  these countries would have more freedom to operate and what's particularly interesting is what
*22:02.320- 22:07.440* :  the intelligence services have told us this morning. Now they have said that over the past year a
*22:07.440- 22:13.560* :  significant number of North Korean diplomats and high level officials who opposed overseas
*22:14.000- 22:20.200* :  have defected. Now when North Koreans opposed overseas they are monitored quite closely by security
*22:20.200- 22:25.760* :  agents and so when they escape it is these security agents that can get the blame and so what the
*22:25.760- 22:32.480* :  intelligence services have told us is that these security agents have fed back to Pyongyang that the
*22:32.480- 22:37.280* :  people who have escaped were actually tricked by South Korean officials. They have fed this back
*22:37.280- 22:43.220* :  presumably to stop themselves being punished for these defections but what it means is that North
*22:43.220- 22:48.560* :  Korea is now seeking to retaliate and as part of this retaliation it is planning these attacks on
*22:48.560- 22:53.800* :  these South Korean officials overseas. The judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial
*22:53.800- 22:59.460* :  has corrected the former president's false assertion that a gag order prevented him from testifying
*22:59.460- 23:04.400* :  on his own behalf. At the beginning of the session Justice Juan Marchán told Mr. Trump he had
*23:04.400- 23:10.100* :  an absolute right to testify. Mr. Trump has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of falsifying
*23:10.100- 23:15.600* :  business records to cover up payments to the porn actress Stormi Daniels. Yesterday the court
*23:15.600- 23:20.560* :  heard from Donald Trump's longtime aide, Hope Hicks, a correspondent at a traffic was there.
*23:45.180- 23:51.680* :  she worked on was very much a part of his press strategy and all of the statements that went out
*23:51.680- 23:56.680* :  so somebody that was very in tune with how the press coverage would be affecting him and his
*23:56.680- 24:02.120* :  campaign. She discussed how the campaign was in crisis after the access Hollywood tape,
*24:02.120- 24:09.140* :  how it was wall-to-wall media coverage for 36 hours until the presidential debate even knocking
*24:09.140- 24:16.340* :  a real category for her to cane off of the news. She said and then she got to the actual
*24:17.320- 24:24.460* :  article that went out exposing the Stormi Daniels payment and she said that Donald Trump had told
*24:24.460- 24:31.280* :  her that he that the affair never happened to deny the affair in press statements and that when
*24:31.280- 24:37.000* :  Michael Cohen told the New York Times that he had made the payment that Donald Trump told her
*24:37.240- 24:43.360* :  that he was very loyal and he had paid off this woman as a favor to him and when prosecutors
*24:43.360- 24:49.720* :  asked her if that sounded like something Michael Cohen would do she said it did seem out of character
*24:49.720- 24:56.380* :  for him that he was someone who liked to take credit and wasn't exactly a charitable person.
*24:56.460- 25:02.860* :  So overall some pretty devastating testimony for the defense that they now have to contend with
*25:02.860- 25:08.380* :  on cross-examination. Let a topic in New York. Top Indian wrestlers of criticized
*25:08.380- 25:13.420* :  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party for fielding the son of their former federation chief in
*25:13.420- 25:18.560* :  national elections despite his father being charged with sexually harassing female wrestlers.
*25:19.000- 25:22.160* :  This from our South Asia Regional Editor, and Barrison Etherargin.
*25:22.560- 25:28.320* :  A celebrated, Olympic Madelvinning female wrestler, Sakshi Malik said by giving an election ticket
*25:28.320- 25:34.940* :  to bridge push and sings son, the BJP had shattered the aspirations of India's millions of daughters.
*25:35.460- 25:42.280* :  Current, the son of Mr Singh is standing as the BJP candidate in Kaiser Ganch constituency in Uthapradesh.
*25:42.660- 25:48.660* :  A seat his father has one six times. In January police filed charges against Mr Singh
*25:48.660- 25:55.080* :  after several women wrestlers accused him of sexual harassment when he headed India's top wrestling
*25:55.080- 25:58.660* :  body. He denies wrongdoing and is currently on bail.
*25:59.720- 26:05.440* :  Bee populations have been in decline since the 1950s around the world. Now a new study from Canada
*26:05.440- 26:10.940* :  thinks it might have found the reason why. The team from the University of Gelf point to rising
*26:10.940- 26:15.760* :  temperatures boiling bees in their own nests. Here's Stephanie Prentice.
*26:18.240- 26:24.260* :  Bumblebees spend a substantial part of their life pollinating plants and flowers returning to
*26:24.260- 26:30.320* :  underground nests they burrow into the ground. But a new study says those nests are under threat
*26:30.320- 26:35.580* :  with rising global temperatures making Bumblebees nest too hot for them to survive in.
*26:35.920- 26:41.760* :  The researchers reviewed studies dating back to the 1800s and found that regardless of species
*26:41.760- 26:49.700* :  or region, Bumblebees prefer a nest temperature around 28 and 32 degrees Celsius. When nest temperatures
*26:49.700- 26:56.080* :  surpassed 36 degrees, the bees couldn't reproduce. It also found that one heat wave could wipe out
*26:56.080- 27:02.580* :  a generation of young bees. Study lead author Dr Peter Kevin looked at bees in many different
*27:02.580- 27:06.720* :  environments and concluded heat could be the top threat to the species.
*27:07.220- 27:13.800* :  While the scale of one to ten, I think global climate change is in the top. It's probably a
*27:13.800- 27:19.920* :  my concern would be about seven and a half eight. But then of course there's all the issues
*27:19.920- 27:26.740* :  of pesticide land use a lot of serious things going on. Bumblebees populations also have habitat
*27:26.740- 27:32.180* :  loss to contend with particularly as floods become more frequent and as their numbers dwindle
*27:32.180- 27:38.940* :  the implications for humans intensify. Professor Nigel Reign is an environmental expert specializing
*27:38.940- 27:44.820* :  in pollination. These are incredibly important for the pollination of many fruits, vegetable and
*27:44.820- 27:50.700* :  nut crops. So they're really important in managing the breadth of our diet and many of the
*27:50.700- 27:56.260* :  the micronutrients we rely on are produced by those crops. So we could survive without bees,
*27:56.260- 28:01.860* :  but our diet would be very de-porperate. So it would be a very different dietary landscape.
*28:02.180- 28:07.240* :  The scientists are now calling for more research into how Bumblebees can survive rising temperatures
*28:07.720- 28:14.760* :  around the world. Michelangelo was born in 1475 and grew up in Florence. Five and a half
*28:14.760- 28:19.340* :  centuries on he remains one of the world's most influential artists of all time.
*28:19.960- 28:24.300* :  A new show at the British Museum in London looks at part of his life which is sometimes neglected.
*28:24.860- 28:30.800* :  The years Michelangelo spent in Rome before he died at the age of 88. Vincent Dowd went to see the
*28:36.320- 28:41.380* :  exhibition. Grant Lewis has curated a show about the late life of someone art lovers
*28:41.380- 28:48.180* :  adore, but is there anything new to say about Michelangelo as he was in a new home and reaching
*28:48.180- 28:53.220* :  60. It's one of the really most fascinating parts of his life. The most famous works the
*28:53.220- 28:57.320* :  Sistine Chapel, the David. This is how he gets the reputation as Europe's most famous artist,
*28:57.720- 29:02.220* :  but what we really want to show is how he actually lives with that reputation while also facing
*29:02.220- 29:07.320* :  the growing challenges of aging because he dies at the age of 88 but quite remarkably he is working
*29:07.320- 29:14.540* :  several days before he died. The artist fell out of favor in the Florentine state and in 1534 he
*29:14.540- 29:21.500* :  moved to Rome. Their Michelangelo even in periods of ill health was incapable of limiting himself
*29:21.500- 29:27.480* :  to any single medium. Most of the period we're looking at he is spending most of his time as an
*29:27.480- 29:34.320* :  architect and we also have Michelangelo sonnets. Incredibly powerful raw emotive works which I think
*29:34.320- 29:39.840* :  add a whole new facet to Michelangelo's creativity that we're not so familiar with and we also have
*29:39.840- 29:44.940* :  Michelangelo's letters which show deliveries of cheeses, deliveries of wines and he does attribute
*29:44.940- 29:49.020* :  part of his recovery to Trebiano wines which I can totally get on board with.
*29:54.740- 30:00.880* :  Into his 80s he worked on countless projects which the exhibition illustrates including designs
*30:00.880- 30:08.180* :  for rebuilding Saint Peter's Basilica. So this is a black chalk sketch about 25 centimeters by 40
*30:08.180- 30:14.580* :  centimeters of the dome. No one had attempted a dome anything like this since Philip
*30:14.580- 30:19.600* :  Brunelleschi had made the dome for Florence Cathedral well over a hundred years earlier and of
*30:19.600- 30:23.460* :  course he knew this was going to be the thing that would dominate Rome the dome you'd see far
*30:23.460- 30:29.720* :  into the Roman countryside so it is a major preoccupation for him. But it was finished after his death.
*30:29.720- 30:34.360* :  Long after his death yes and he knew this and I think it's quite a remarkable thing to think that
*30:34.360- 30:39.920* :  his Michelangelo working on something that he knew he would never see. Grant Lewis says there was
*30:39.920- 30:45.700* :  an emotional life though the detail is now lost to us. You see it very strongly in some of the
*30:45.700- 30:50.520* :  sonnets where he really does pour his heart out with incredible candor. Michelangelo is obsessed
*30:50.520- 30:55.300* :  with dynasty and if you look at some of the letters we have in the show one of his main preoccupations
*30:55.520- 31:00.400* :  at this time is making sure that his family line continues he knew he was not going to have any
*31:00.400- 31:05.800* :  children so he really does pester his poor long-suffering nephew to get married to make sure that
*31:05.800- 31:14.500* :  the family line continues. Do you think he ever thought I'm right at the end of my life?
*31:14.500- 31:19.080* :  Did he ever even think in those terms? If I'm honest I think he thought that for the entire 30 years
*31:19.080- 31:23.760* :  covered by this show. I think every project he probably approached thinking this might well be
*31:23.760- 31:28.620* :  his last. He would have had absolutely no idea in 1534 when we start this show that he would
*31:28.620- 31:33.060* :  have been working for another 30 years. And that centuries later we still love his work.
*31:33.480- 31:37.200* :  I hope he'd be thinking we'd be celebrating at least some of his works he certainly made
*31:37.200- 31:41.520* :  St Peter's Basilica with a view to permanence and I think he'd be rather pleased to see that much
*31:41.520- 31:45.660* :  of his design was eventually carried out. As for some of these drawings I think he'd be slightly
*31:45.660- 31:50.100* :  less pleased that we were seeing the inner workings of his mind. The new show at the British
*31:50.100- 31:55.620* :  Museum reminds us that long after he worked on the Sistine Chapel or created the world famous
*31:55.620- 32:02.700* :  sculpture of David Michelangelo's extraordinary energies were as strong and as diverse as ever.
*32:07.240- 32:08.480* :  Vincent Dowd reporting.
