*01:31.100- 01:35.040* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and 13 hours GMT on Monday the 27th of May.
*01:35.040- 01:36.500* :  These are our main stories.
*01:37.020- 01:42.380* :  Israel faces growing condemnation after an airstrike and raffer, which Palestinian officials say
*01:42.380- 01:44.260* :  killed dozens of displaced people.
*01:44.940- 01:50.140* :  More than 2,000 people are now feared dead after Friday's landslide in Papua New Guinea.
*01:50.800- 01:55.540* :  The World Health Organization meets to discuss its preparedness for future pandemics.
*01:58.160- 02:02.920* :  Also in this podcast, South Africa's president, Silro Ramaposa, addresses the nation ahead
*02:02.920- 02:03.480* :  of elections.
*02:03.980- 02:05.440* :  And...
*02:05.440- 02:07.780* :  It's a very, very sad story for me.
*02:07.860- 02:12.000* :  So I'm definitely not happy about it, but I'm happy it's going back to the museum.
*02:12.000- 02:13.360* :  This is much more important.
*02:13.700- 02:18.980* :  The FBI investigates hundreds of treasures believed to have been stolen from the British
*02:25.120- 02:25.140* :  museum.
*02:25.180- 02:30.400* :  Israel is facing international condemnation over an airstrike in southern Gaza on Sunday
*02:30.400- 02:33.500* :  that appears to have caused dozens of Palestinian deaths.
*02:34.140- 02:39.700* :  Israel says the attack successfully targeted two senior hammer officials at a military compound
*02:39.700- 02:40.380* :  in Raffa.
*02:40.760- 02:45.880* :  But after reviewing the incident, it's acknowledged that civilians were killed in a fire that broke
*02:45.880- 02:47.880* :  out in a nearby refugee camp.
*02:48.500- 02:53.200* :  Palestinian health officials have said at least 45 people died, many of them children,
*02:53.580- 02:55.400* :  and more than 200 were wounded.
*02:55.720- 03:00.620* :  Philippe Lazareini, the head of UNRA, the UN Agency leading the humanitarian operation
*03:00.620- 03:05.420* :  in Gaza, told journalists in Beirut that he's disturbed by the incident.
*03:06.280- 03:12.220* :  I cannot comment on the casualties because we haven't been able to properly communicate
*03:12.900- 03:14.120* :  without him on the ground.
*03:14.980- 03:20.080* :  I saw images that are deeply disturbing and horrifying.
*03:21.020- 03:23.680* :  I think we have been clear more than once.
*03:24.360- 03:26.720* :  There is no safe space in Gaza.
*03:27.720- 03:31.020* :  Israel says it regrets any harm done to civilians.
*03:31.640- 03:34.080* :  Avi Hyman is a spokesman for the Israeli government.
*03:34.080- 03:41.640* :  We went after two high-value Hamas targets, and it appears from initial reports that somehow
*03:41.640- 03:45.080* :  a fire broke out, that's how he took the lives of others.
*03:45.080- 03:49.740* :  Now I say it appears, too, because it is under investigation, and the IDF investigates
*03:49.740- 03:55.720* :  every accident of this nature to see what actually happened, whereas Hamas runs to the
*03:55.720- 03:59.140* :  media to tell tales that will help them propaganda wise.
*03:59.720- 04:04.280* :  So Israel is coming under pressure again, as I heard from the BBC's Arab Affairs
*04:04.280- 04:06.100* :  analyst Sebastien Oshar.
*04:06.620- 04:13.080* :  It's a continuation of really quite bad publicity for Israel in the past week or so,
*04:13.080- 04:18.260* :  the two rulings that were made by the International Criminal Court, the prosecutor there, saying
*04:18.260- 04:22.180* :  that he was seeking a arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*04:22.180- 04:26.840* :  and the Defence Minister about a week ago, and then the ICJ, the International Court
*04:26.840- 04:35.080* :  of Justice, ruling, literally ordering Israel to stop its operations in Raffa on Friday.
*04:35.740- 04:40.780* :  And interestingly, in some of the reactions, but they've been to what happened overnight
*04:41.460- 04:42.140* :  in Raffa.
*04:42.440- 04:50.540* :  There's been mention about the EU-made policy head Josep Borrel said that Israel must follow
*04:50.920- 04:52.200* :  that ruling as soon as possible.
*04:52.620- 04:57.040* :  We've had very strong call from Emmanuel Macron, the French President, saying he's outraged
*04:57.740- 04:58.520* :  by what happened.
*04:59.040- 05:04.760* :  So as I say, this is really a continuation of the way that the general feeling across the
*05:04.760- 05:09.980* :  international community, that includes most of Israel's Western allies, seems to be turning
*05:09.980- 05:13.400* :  more and more against the actions, but the Israeli government is taking at the moment.
*05:13.800- 05:20.240* :  And do you think that there could be ramifications for the peace talks, which are scheduled for tomorrow?
*05:20.620- 05:26.080* :  I think there's still some uncertainty over quite how far any kind of resumption of the
*05:26.080- 05:28.100* :  peace talks is headed at the moment.
*05:28.160- 05:33.360* :  And then there was optimism that's been expressed by the US and on the Israeli side that things
*05:33.360- 05:35.880* :  may be picked up again this week.
*05:35.880- 05:40.460* :  But Hamas has essentially said that it hasn't seen anything new in the office.
*05:41.120- 05:47.340* :  And what we've heard as a result of what happened in Raffa overnight from two of the main
*05:47.340- 05:52.240* :  mediators, Egypt and Qatar, first of all, condemnation, but from Qatar in particular,
*05:52.840- 05:57.280* :  saying that what happened could complicate any mediation efforts.
*05:57.820- 06:03.120* :  As I say, I mean, I don't think there was huge optimism, but there would be any major move
*06:03.560- 06:04.520* :  in the short term.
*06:04.840- 06:09.080* :  But of course, there's always hope that the continuation of the talks will, at some point,
*06:09.680- 06:15.060* :  lead to an actual deal that can be put into practice, which would see at least some Israeli
*06:15.060- 06:20.580* :  hostages released a much larger number of Palestinian prisons held in Israel, freed as well,
*06:21.040- 06:23.620* :  and a ceasefire of at least six weeks.
*06:24.220- 06:28.500* :  We've heard that many times, though, and I think that people who are following this are
*06:28.500- 06:32.260* :  now very cautious about any kind of sense that this could be coming soon.
*06:32.820- 06:33.720* :  Sebastian Usher.
*06:34.540- 06:39.220* :  Eight agencies in Papua New Guinea say they're struggling to reach those buried by a huge
*06:39.220- 06:43.940* :  landslide on Friday, as rocks are still falling and the ground is still shifting.
*06:44.480- 06:48.640* :  The government says more than 2,000 people may have been buried alive on Sunday.
*06:48.640- 06:53.780* :  A UN spokesman estimated about 670 may still be under the debris.
*06:54.520- 06:56.740* :  Our Australia correspondent Katie Watson reports.
*06:57.600- 07:02.200* :  Help is desperately needed in anger, but while people wait for it to arrive, there's
*07:02.200- 07:03.460* :  nothing else for it.
*07:03.640- 07:06.600* :  They're digging through debris with any tool they can find.
*07:07.480- 07:12.640* :  Nearly four days on from the landslide, few bodies have been pulled from the rubble, while
*07:12.640- 07:14.700* :  this family is able to bury their loved one.
*07:15.220- 07:17.540* :  Not many here are being afforded this moment.
*07:18.040- 07:22.900* :  It was three in the morning on Friday when the landslide struck, wiping out well over
*07:22.900- 07:25.340* :  a hundred houses while residents were asleep.
*07:26.040- 07:28.480* :  The final death toll won't be known for some time.
*07:29.060- 07:33.160* :  In the interim, these numbers, the authorities are giving, can only be estimates.
*07:33.620- 07:38.440* :  Added to that, the population swelled recently because of nearby tribal violence.
*07:38.980- 07:41.080* :  That's also made the rescue effort harder.
*07:41.540- 07:45.840* :  According to this remote part of Papua New Guinea, with blocked roads and security threats
*07:45.840- 07:49.580* :  is a challenge, and the conditions on the ground are still difficult.
*07:50.420- 07:55.180* :  Papua New Guinea has called for international assistance, neighbouring Australia has already
*07:55.780- 08:00.600* :  responded, and humanitarian agencies are on the ground, but more help is needed in
*08:00.600- 08:03.600* :  what's looking more like a recovery than a rescue mission.
*08:03.980- 08:08.460* :  This is a community in mourning, and people are still waiting to say their goodbyes.
*08:08.980- 08:09.640* :  Katie Watson.
*08:10.580- 08:15.040* :  Members of the World Health Organization are in Geneva for their annual assembly, and
*08:15.040- 08:18.940* :  top of the agenda is how to make the world prepared for another pandemic.
*08:19.480- 08:24.640* :  Pressure is growing to establish a global treaty aimed at correcting the mistakes highlighted
*08:24.640- 08:30.060* :  by the spread of COVID-19 four years ago, but so far an agreement has not been reached.
*08:30.600- 08:35.200* :  Our correspondent in Geneva Imogen Foux told me what a potential treaty would contain.
*08:35.860- 08:41.220* :  The key aim, as you said, is to make sure we do a whole lot better than we did coping
*08:41.220- 08:47.960* :  with COVID-19, which is widely viewed as a disaster as far as global cooperation goes.
*08:48.400- 08:53.200* :  The key things in some of the drafts I've seen of this treaty are better surveillance
*08:53.200- 09:00.200* :  of disease outbreaks, rapid binding pathogen sharing, especially things that could cause
*09:00.200- 09:06.420* :  new diseases that could cause major harm, and key the sharing of vaccines and treatments
*09:06.460- 09:11.680* :  so that poor countries do not get left out as they did with COVID-19.
*09:11.680- 09:19.540* :  The World Health Organization set this ambitious target of this month, May 2024, to get it done,
*09:19.540- 09:24.420* :  and it was always difficult, because international treaties, especially once like this, which
*09:24.420- 09:28.900* :  would be legally binding, typically really do take many, many years.
*09:29.660- 09:34.720* :  But public health experts, and they're here in Geneva for this assembly, are saying
*09:34.720- 09:38.560* :  really another pandemic is inevitable.
*09:38.580- 09:44.220* :  Surrey Moon, his professor of global health at Geneva's Graduate Institute, told me
*09:44.240- 09:45.500* :  time is running out.
*09:45.920- 09:52.280* :  We need the meaningful outlines and contours of a binding agreement to be accepted and
*09:52.280- 09:56.360* :  endorsed by the end of May, otherwise I think we can have talks that drag on for years
*09:56.360- 10:02.600* :  and years and years, and could end up yielding nothing until of course the next crisis happens,
*10:02.920- 10:04.880* :  and that's what we've seen time and time again.
*10:05.860- 10:11.380* :  And Imagym, as you said, scientists agree there will be another pandemic, so why the delay
*10:11.380- 10:12.520* :  in agreeing a treaty?
*10:14.560- 10:19.400* :  The key obstacle is around that word sharing, it's a bit sad, really, given what we all
*10:19.400- 10:22.260* :  went through in the COVID-19 pandemic.
*10:22.700- 10:28.780* :  But wealthy countries are balking a bit at the suggestion that they should be legally
*10:28.780- 10:35.920* :  obliged to set aside 20% of vaccines and treatments for poorer countries.
*10:36.480- 10:39.760* :  They're talking about it maybe in affecting their sovereignty.
*10:40.420- 10:45.160* :  They want to be able to help their own populations first in the event of a pandemic.
*10:45.840- 10:50.820* :  Now developing countries who really miss down on the vaccines and treatments, they've
*10:50.820- 10:56.460* :  been told they need to monitor disease outbreaks much better, that costs money, and they need
*10:56.460- 10:59.440* :  to share the pathogens they identify.
*11:00.000- 11:05.020* :  And they are saying, look, if we do this, and we share the pathogens with wealthy countries
*11:05.020- 11:09.540* :  where all the pharmaceutical industry is, they make the vaccines and they make the treatments
*11:09.540- 11:14.360* :  and they make money out of that, and we don't get a guarantee of those vaccines and treatments.
*11:14.820- 11:20.620* :  So that's pretty much the nub of the argument going on in Geneva.
*11:21.440- 11:28.960* :  There is a slim chance we still might get a vague treaty, but I think the chances of
*11:28.960- 11:35.940* :  a really inked dry on a hard and fast, legally binding treaty for meaningful global cooperation
*11:36.920- 11:40.760* :  have to say there's not a lot of hope that we're going to see that by the end of this
*11:40.800- 11:41.120* :  week.
*11:43.320- 11:48.440* :  Tourism is generally seen as a welcome economic boost, but the Spanish island of Mallorca
*11:48.440- 11:53.540* :  is the latest holiday hotspot where locals have demonstrated against too much of it.
*11:54.080- 11:59.400* :  On Saturday, 10,000 people marched through Palmer, holding posters, reading SOS residents
*11:59.400- 12:04.760* :  enough mass tourism, and that our knees is replicated throughout the Balearic Islands.
*12:04.760- 12:10.660* :  Aranso Fernández is a deputy for the Socialist Parliamentary Group in the Balearic Parliament.
*12:11.340- 12:17.040* :  Right now it is impossible for a citizen from Ibiza or Mallorca to find a room or a flat
*12:17.040- 12:22.080* :  to rent because around 60% of the total rent are only for some season.
*12:22.480- 12:28.060* :  Owners prefer to rent only to tourists because they earn more money rent in three months
*12:28.060- 12:31.760* :  through our B&B than 12 months to arrest him or then.
*12:32.560- 12:37.600* :  So therefore, nobody wants to come here to work in a lot of people born and raised here
*12:37.600- 12:39.940* :  in Ibiza, I'll leave you in from the daylin'.
*12:40.420- 12:45.320* :  To combat the problem elsewhere, Venice has introduced new tourist taxes, cruise ships
*12:45.320- 12:51.020* :  in Crete are being regulated, and in Japan an iconic view of Mount Fuji has been blocked
*12:51.020- 12:56.940* :  off after residents complained of the area being overrun by millions of tourists taking selfies.
*12:57.780- 13:03.000* :  Simon Jack spoke to Peter DeBrine, senior project officer of UNESCO's World Heritage
*13:03.000- 13:05.580* :  and Sustainable Tourism Programme.
*13:06.000- 13:11.020* :  Sustainable tourism really is where you have a balance between tourism and conservation
*13:11.020- 13:16.540* :  and community well-being, and what we're seeing right now are thresholds being breached.
*13:16.540- 13:20.880* :  I think that's really important, there's a tolerance that is no longer there in a lot
*13:20.880- 13:23.780* :  of these communities, so that's the response we're getting.
*13:23.980- 13:29.240* :  Is that threshold that's being breached, is it to do with property prices and locals
*13:29.240- 13:34.840* :  not being able to afford to live in their own town, or is it environmental with cruise ships
*13:34.840- 13:38.620* :  coming in and churning up the water, what are the thresholds that you're talking about?
*13:39.280- 13:43.080* :  I think that's all of them actually, I think all of these things are happening at once.
*13:43.440- 13:47.740* :  The interesting thing though is that policymakers are responding and that's what you're also
*13:47.880- 13:48.060* :  seeing.
*13:48.340- 13:54.980* :  I think this is something that UNESCO really advocates is unfettered tourism and is just
*13:54.980- 13:56.300* :  not possible anymore.
*13:56.300- 13:59.000* :  We need to be looking at how we can better manage it.
*13:59.160- 14:00.240* :  What is the answer?
*14:00.240- 14:02.580* :  You say that this policy leave is being pulled?
*14:02.580- 14:03.720* :  What is that taxation?
*14:04.020- 14:05.520* :  Is it discouraging people?
*14:05.520- 14:07.780* :  What are some of the initiatives that people are looking at?
*14:08.140- 14:13.180* :  Well, I think fundamentally any destination wants to welcome tourists and I think we really
*14:13.600- 14:19.260* :  are focusing on how we can make that visitor experience better because chances are if
*14:19.260- 14:23.600* :  you're having a great experience, if it's not crowded, the destination is well managed.
*14:23.600- 14:26.040* :  I think that's something to really keep in mind.
*14:26.560- 14:28.640* :  There is unfortunately no magic bullet.
*14:28.900- 14:34.340* :  Each destination is different, each destination is dealing with different pressures from tourism
*14:34.560- 14:36.780* :  and that's what we're seeing is we're seeing different responses.
*14:37.040- 14:39.040* :  It's a real paradox, isn't it?
*14:39.480- 14:43.900* :  Someone wants to go to some unspoiled island until everyone discovers that it gets spoiled.
*14:44.400- 14:49.380* :  But presumably a happier place where residents are happy to welcome you is a better experience
*14:49.380- 14:50.480* :  for the traveler as well.
*14:51.120- 14:51.600* :  Absolutely.
*14:51.980- 14:55.300* :  We always say better places to live or better places to visit.
*14:55.300- 14:59.280* :  We're all travelers and we all want to go on holiday and we want to feel good.
*14:59.280- 15:01.080* :  We don't want to feel guilty necessarily.
*15:01.940- 15:06.460* :  But at the same time, I think consumer behavior is an area where we really need to focus and
*15:06.460- 15:08.600* :  raise awareness so we can avoid some of these problems.
*15:08.680- 15:13.240* :  I just have final thought because Airbnb comes up a lot in items around, for example,
*15:13.240- 15:15.000* :  local saying they're getting priced out of areas.
*15:15.000- 15:17.000* :  It happens in coastal communities here in the UK.
*15:17.320- 15:18.840* :  Does it come up a lot in your work?
*15:19.200- 15:25.100* :  Again, it's one of these things, this phenomenon that has, I think, kind of taken people by surprise.
*15:25.100- 15:32.200* :  It's similar to right after the big financial crash in 2008 when many destinations were
*15:32.740- 15:36.560* :  wanting more tourists to offset the financial devastation that was occurring.
*15:37.240- 15:40.020* :  And that's where you saw the rise of low-cost airlines.
*15:40.200- 15:45.180* :  So low-cost airlines also have had a big impact on bringing people to a lot of destinations
*15:45.200- 15:48.420* :  at a very low price so it made it possible for a lot of people.
*15:49.180- 15:50.800* :  Peter DeBrine of UNESCO
*15:54.040- 15:59.120* :  Still to come, a well-known pop singer in Thailand is sentenced to jail for insulting
*15:59.160- 15:59.940* :  the monarchy there.
*16:00.300- 16:01.580* :  And...
*16:01.580- 16:06.800* :  If a battery pack is smaller, the cost of the manufacturing of that car is significantly
*16:07.900- 16:10.660* :  How to keep the cost of an electric car down
*16:18.140- 16:22.320* :  One size fits all seems like a good idea for clothes, until you try them on.
*16:22.580- 16:23.600* :  Same goes for healthcare.
*16:24.020- 16:27.740* :  That's why United Healthcare offers flexible, budget-friendly coverage
*16:27.740- 16:30.120* :  for medical, vision, dental, and more.

*17:09.000- 17:10.980* :  South Africa goes to the polls on Wednesday,
*17:10.980- 17:15.580* :  but those who've registered for special votes can cast their ballots from today.
*17:15.920- 17:19.880* :  President Cyril Ramaposa made the announcement in a television address to the nation
*17:19.880- 17:24.920* :  on Sunday evening, which was criticized by the opposition for being a campaign speech.
*17:25.500- 17:29.740* :  Rob Young heard more from the BBC's Catherine Biera Hanger in Johannesburg.
*17:30.360- 17:35.380* :  His tone at the beginning was statement like he praised the institutions of South Africa,
*17:35.800- 17:39.740* :  especially the electoral commission ahead of early voting beginning today.
*17:40.600- 17:44.940* :  But then he went on to talk about the successes of his ANC government,
*17:44.960- 17:50.340* :  and there has been some reaction from South Africans who felt an easy about the president.
*17:50.340- 17:57.700* :  They say using his platform, his official state platform as president to campaign for South Africans.
*17:57.700- 18:03.300* :  His message to South Africans was to give his party yet another term in office.
*18:03.300- 18:07.000* :  This would be its seventh term in office at the moment they have been questions
*18:07.580- 18:11.140* :  as to whether his government has done enough to erode corruption,
*18:11.140- 18:15.880* :  to help build state services such as electricity, health.
*18:16.320- 18:18.020* :  So this was his message to the country.
*18:18.760- 18:21.960* :  When this administration took office in 2019,
*18:22.600- 18:24.800* :  our country stood at a turning point.
*18:25.460- 18:33.380* :  We had endured a decade of corruption and state capture of weak economic growth
*18:34.400- 18:36.920* :  and the erosion of our public institutions.
*18:37.600- 18:40.540* :  Today we have put that era behind us.
*18:40.740- 18:44.600* :  We have placed South Africa on a new trajectory of recovery
*18:45.460- 18:48.940* :  and laid a strong foundation for future growth.
*18:49.500- 18:53.720* :  The last five years have been a time of rebuilding and recovery
*18:53.720- 18:57.900* :  as this sixth administration draws to a close
*18:58.200- 19:01.020* :  and as we prepare for their seventh administration,
*19:01.060- 19:04.480* :  let us build on the progress that we have made.
*19:05.240- 19:09.080* :  South Africa's president and the leader of the ANC there, Cyril Ramaphosa.
*19:09.080- 19:13.780* :  Catherine, he was arguing that the ANC are part of the solution to South Africa's problems,
*19:13.780- 19:18.560* :  but our voters likely to give them another term in power to try to turn things around.
*19:19.860- 19:22.420* :  This is a difficult time for many South Africans.
*19:22.420- 19:27.280* :  As you know, the unemployment rate in the country stands at 30%.
*19:27.280- 19:30.380* :  One of the highest in the world and when it comes to young people,
*19:30.380- 19:32.560* :  that rate is at 50%.
*19:32.960- 19:36.660* :  The chronic problems in the health facilities South Africans have to wait
*19:36.660- 19:40.540* :  sometimes up to six hours to see a medical practitioner.
*19:40.540- 19:44.040* :  So all of that is impacting the ANC's popularity.
*19:44.680- 19:48.680* :  But it's important to say that this is the party of Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela.
*19:48.680- 19:52.100* :  It has cemented its position within South African history
*19:52.560- 19:54.520* :  and bringing down the apartheid ratio.
*19:54.520- 19:56.620* :  So it's still incredibly popular.
*19:57.160- 20:00.260* :  But nevertheless, opposition parties see an opportunity.
*20:00.260- 20:03.800* :  First of all, the main opposition party, the DA,
*20:03.800- 20:08.920* :  has created what it calls the multi-party charter, a coalition of ten parties.
*20:08.920- 20:13.040* :  They say that if they get enough votes, more than 50%,
*20:13.040- 20:15.480* :  they will be able to dislodge the ANC.
*20:15.820- 20:18.840* :  There's also the prospects that the ANC could,
*20:19.540- 20:21.360* :  if it loses its majority in parliament,
*20:21.360- 20:24.980* :  turn to these parties individually to create a coalition.
*20:25.460- 20:28.640* :  The DA, despite being a long time opposition party,
*20:28.640- 20:33.340* :  has not discounted joining a coalition with the ANC.
*20:33.380- 20:35.560* :  But they say they need some concessions.
*20:35.580- 20:37.020* :  I spoke to Solimisanga.
*20:37.460- 20:41.180* :  He is the DA's local representative for halting province.
*20:41.180- 20:43.360* :  We're not going to prep them up, you know,
*20:43.360- 20:46.940* :  to continue with the failings that they actually initiated.
*20:47.420- 20:51.900* :  If they cannot be about an open capital-led economy in South Africa,
*20:51.900- 20:54.080* :  the state-owned entities that have fallen apart,
*20:54.080- 20:55.980* :  whether they're talking in South African airways,
*20:55.980- 20:57.620* :  whether you're talking about Dinell,
*20:57.760- 21:00.320* :  you're talking about Eskom with electricity producers,
*21:00.720- 21:02.360* :  and so many others that have fallen.
*21:02.760- 21:05.440* :  If you're talking about the policies around land,
*21:05.520- 21:06.880* :  you say it's in land ownership,
*21:06.880- 21:10.240* :  which has really not been one of their strong forties.
*21:10.520- 21:14.400* :  This is why we've had so much people who are uneasy about investing.
*21:14.680- 21:16.240* :  So these are things that we have said to them.
*21:16.240- 21:19.400* :  These are things that need to be changed and they need to be addressed.
*21:19.680- 21:23.100* :  And unfortunately, they're not willing to then engage and talk to those things.
*21:23.100- 21:25.020* :  Then we can't have a conversation with them.
*21:25.320- 21:26.280* :  Solimisanga there.
*21:26.440- 21:31.580* :  So Catherine, we mentioned before that early voting is beginning on Monday,
*21:31.580- 21:35.240* :  any indication on what turn-out is likely to be,
*21:35.240- 21:38.420* :  not just today, but on Wednesday, and when will we know the result?
*21:38.960- 21:42.860* :  At the last election, the turnout was around 6% to 6%.
*21:43.360- 21:49.680* :  But the worry is that perhaps there has been some voter apathy that has set in amongst South Africans,
*21:50.100- 21:51.900* :  especially supporters of the ANC.
*21:52.200- 21:54.960* :  It's not rare to hear on the radio, on the television.
*21:55.480- 21:58.140* :  ANC supporters saying they're disappointed with the party
*21:58.140- 22:01.460* :  and they might not want to vote for another organizational party,
*22:01.460- 22:03.020* :  but they'll probably stay at home.
*22:03.420- 22:06.020* :  So the worry is that the voter turnout could reduce,
*22:06.060- 22:09.060* :  and that will impact parties across the board.
*22:09.400- 22:14.100* :  The latest polling shows that the ANC will win about 40% of the votes,
*22:14.560- 22:17.400* :  that is drastically lower than the 57%,
*22:17.400- 22:19.360* :  that it's won at the last election.
*22:19.940- 22:22.240* :  Catherine Björerhanger in Johannesburg.
*22:22.980- 22:23.760* :  And now to Thailand.
*22:38.240- 22:43.080* :  The Thai pop singer, Chiamon Khabibunpan, his music sounds innocuous enough,
*22:43.080- 22:48.760* :  but his popularity hasn't been enough to save him from Thailand's draconian Les Majesty laws,
*22:49.120- 22:51.360* :  designed to protect the dignity of the monarchy.
*22:51.880- 22:54.260* :  It's a specific evidence he'll have to move on.
*22:54.740- 22:56.520* :  Today, there were two big core decisions.
*22:56.700- 22:59.660* :  That pop singer you just mentioned, Chiamon Khabibunpan.
*22:59.740- 23:06.260* :  He's been sentenced to four years in prison for spray painting on a portrait
*23:06.800- 23:10.240* :  of the very powerful Thai king with Jira Longcorn.
*23:10.740- 23:12.880* :  We should say the singer, he protested this.
*23:12.880- 23:18.840* :  He said he shouldn't have been sentenced and found guilty of Thailand's Les Majesty laws,
*23:19.500- 23:22.500* :  outlaw any criticism of the monarchy,
*23:22.500- 23:28.320* :  because he said he was just frustrated that fellow activists were being detained.
*23:28.320- 23:33.160* :  That's during some really important protests that really started in 2020
*23:33.160- 23:39.740* :  when young people across Thailand were questioning why the monarchy is allowed to be so powerful.
*23:39.740- 23:45.760* :  Also, the court today sentenced the very popular opposition MP, a politician,
*23:46.140- 23:47.420* :  Chonthita Zhang Reo.
*23:47.940- 23:53.820* :  Now, she gave a speech questioning why the king and the palace are allowed to spend taxpayers' money
*23:53.820- 23:55.780* :  really without any oversight.
*23:55.780- 23:59.020* :  And for that, she's been sentenced to two years in prison,
*23:59.340- 24:01.920* :  although she's appealing it and for now she'll be out on bail.
*24:02.720- 24:07.060* :  And are these very draconian Les Majesty laws
*24:07.240- 24:12.420* :  either be used more often in Thailand to silence dissent?
*24:12.760- 24:14.000* :  Absolutely, Val.
*24:14.020- 24:18.360* :  Since 2020, since those protests that I mentioned kicked off,
*24:18.360- 24:22.020* :  we've seen those laws being used 270 times,
*24:22.160- 24:24.280* :  that's according to Thai human rights groups.
*24:24.780- 24:28.840* :  And in January, we saw one man sentenced to 50 years in prison
*24:29.240- 24:31.940* :  from some Facebook posts that he wrote.
*24:32.400- 24:36.180* :  So this all is happening at a really sensitive time in Thailand,
*24:36.180- 24:42.940* :  just a couple of weeks ago, another high profile pro-democracy activist died in detention
*24:43.060- 24:45.680* :  after carrying out a few hunger strikes.
*24:46.360- 24:51.320* :  And also, the party that won the most votes in Thailand's election last year,
*24:51.320- 24:57.140* :  the move forward party, there's actually a petition to dissolve that entire party.
*24:57.140- 25:02.540* :  They were basically outmaneuvered out of power by more conservative forces.
*25:02.880- 25:05.340* :  And now there's a move to dissolve the entire party,
*25:05.340- 25:09.320* :  even though they won the most votes, because a constitutional court in Thailand
*25:09.320- 25:14.680* :  has found that the fact that they were calling for amendments to those strict laws,
*25:14.700- 25:17.540* :  the Les Majesty laws that we've been talking about,
*25:18.020- 25:21.440* :  could overthrow the entire political order.
*25:21.640- 25:25.680* :  So a lot of political tensions right now in Thailand regarding those laws.
*25:26.200- 25:31.260* :  Silia Hatten, now what would persuade more of us to take up driving electric vehicles?
*25:31.860- 25:35.560* :  Well, it's a question, governments and manufacturers are asking all around the world
*25:35.980- 25:37.280* :  and are trying to address.
*25:38.120- 25:42.040* :  One of those is Silicon Valley-based Lucid, a luxury EV startup.
*25:42.720- 25:45.300* :  Well, Baines spoke to its British boss, Peter Robinson.
*25:46.280- 25:51.120* :  We need to address some of the fundamental barriers to adoption.
*25:51.720- 25:54.520* :  And right now, we've addressed range anxiety.
*25:54.520- 25:57.320* :  We have a car with over 500 miles range.
*25:58.500- 26:03.200* :  But the next big hurdle is the sheer cost of an electric car.
*26:03.760- 26:09.260* :  And that, unlike a petrol engine car, is dominated by the cost of a battery pack.
*26:10.160- 26:13.240* :  And what Lucid is doing is its creating technology,
*26:13.880- 26:17.440* :  which enables the car to go further with less battery.
*26:17.980- 26:23.540* :  And if we can do that, we can create electric cars with smaller battery packs.
*26:23.700- 26:30.580* :  And if the battery pack is smaller, the cost of the manufacturing of that car is significantly less.
*26:30.880- 26:33.960* :  I'm interested in the route that you've gone going high-end first.
*26:33.960- 26:38.060* :  One of the arguments that people have made about the success of BYD, for example,
*26:38.060- 26:40.680* :  with Chinese competitors, is that they kind of went the other way around.
*26:40.700- 26:43.340* :  They got the kind of mass market model out there first.
*26:43.700- 26:50.440* :  Paradoxically, the cost of industrializing many products is inversely proportional to the cost of the product.
*26:50.700- 26:56.240* :  But after we had to attract initial investment, it wasn't on to go from a mass market.
*26:56.560- 27:01.260* :  Now, if you look at BYD, it's a completely inverted economics there,
*27:01.300- 27:05.360* :  because you've got an industry which is heavily subsidised by Chinese government.
*27:05.680- 27:07.500* :  For us, we wanted to start high.
*27:07.920- 27:10.440* :  It enables us to develop the core technology.
*27:10.440- 27:12.960* :  And also, it establishes a brand.
*27:12.960- 27:17.220* :  It's awfully difficult to establish a brand low down and push it up.
*27:17.440- 27:23.680* :  In the way the playing field is currently set up, can companies like Lucid possibly compete with the BYDs?
*27:23.860- 27:25.160* :  It's not a level playing field.
*27:25.700- 27:28.680* :  You've got labour rates which are artificially low.
*27:28.920- 27:33.640* :  And then you've got heavily supported governments incentives for a company like BYD.
*27:33.880- 27:38.680* :  I think the Chinese car industry has advanced him measurably.
*27:39.220- 27:43.980* :  They are inherent ability to design, develop and manufacture cars.
*27:44.580- 27:49.060* :  I still think there are many as behind on the core EV technology.
*27:49.660- 27:51.060* :  But I've no doubt they'll get that.
*27:51.760- 27:52.460* :  Peter Rollinson.
*27:53.640- 27:59.660* :  The BBC has learned that the FBI has been investigating the sale to US buyers of hundreds of treasures
*27:59.660- 28:02.600* :  the British Museum believes were still in from its collection.
*28:03.240- 28:06.900* :  The museum confirmed in August that a large number of objects were missing.
*28:06.900- 28:10.140* :  A police investigation continues here in the UK.
*28:10.800- 28:12.800* :  Here's our culture editor, Katie Razzle.
*28:13.640- 28:15.580* :  It's a pencil, shouldn't it be a pen?
*28:15.780- 28:22.720* :  I'm in a wood paneled staff room inside the British Museum with the Danish antiquities dealer, Dr Itai Gradel.
*28:22.720- 28:24.340* :  It is a pen. It's not a pencil.
*28:24.700- 28:30.580* :  He's sitting next to Professor Tom Harrison, who's leading the museum's recovery programme.
*28:31.080- 28:35.920* :  And he's signing more than 350 ancient gemstones over to the museum.
*28:36.580- 28:39.360* :  Items they and he believe were stolen.
*28:40.120- 28:41.800* :  I haven't practised it from home.
*28:42.800- 28:50.700* :  Itai bought hundreds of gems in good faith over many years, mainly through the online auction site eBay and via another dealer.
*28:51.340- 28:58.180* :  The museum's announcement last August about missing, stolen and damaged items wasn't news to Dr Gradel.
*28:58.800- 29:05.240* :  He had first tried to warn more than two years before that he believed a curator was stealing from its collection.
*29:05.240- 29:08.320* :  He was brushed off by the museum several times.
*29:09.160- 29:11.800* :  Former Chancellor George Osborne is the chair of trustees.
*29:12.400- 29:15.120* :  Was there an effort made to protect the reputation of the museum?
*29:15.240- 29:16.620* :  People have called it a cover-up.
*29:16.700- 29:21.120* :  I absolutely reject that. There are people who made mistakes. There are people who may have been naive.
*29:21.120- 29:25.620* :  But there was no deliberate attempt to conceal from the public what had happened.
*29:25.840- 29:33.560* :  The museum claims its curator, Dr Peter Higgs, who's been sacked, sold its treasures to at least 45 buyers on eBay.
*29:34.160- 29:37.660* :  Peter Higgs denies any wrongdoing. The police are investigating.
*29:37.700- 29:44.380* :  But since the story broke, we've been on the hunt for hundreds of treasures that appear scattered across the world.
*29:45.100- 29:54.700* :  Itai Gradel has located objects he sold on in Hamburg, Cologne, Hong Kong and Paris, where I joined him for a handover of four gems.
*29:55.940- 29:56.540* :  What a place.
*29:57.320- 29:58.400* :  OK. It's the moment.
*29:58.980- 30:00.100* :  Yeah, there they are.
*30:00.600- 30:07.820* :  We've also found two gems on display in a temporary exhibition in another museum in a small town in Germany.
*30:08.440- 30:11.900* :  That museum would have had no idea that they may have been stolen.
*30:12.700- 30:17.420* :  And we've discovered that the FBI has been investigating sales made in the US.
*30:17.420- 30:22.280* :  I got an email from an FBI. I was completely shocked. I don't want any trouble.
*30:22.380- 30:26.380* :  That's Tony O. Barbeglier, a former gem dealer based in New Orleans.
*30:26.380- 30:31.940* :  He told us an FBI agent contacted him about items he'd bought on eBay.
*30:32.200- 30:34.700* :  I didn't have anything to hide. I'm glad these spoke with him.
*30:34.840- 30:42.940* :  We've since established that Tonyo bought two gems, one depicting the God of Desire cupid, the other the Egyptian God Anubis.
*30:43.420- 30:50.400* :  That was when I was working for a really big antique store, which is known for big antiques in New Orleans.
*30:50.800- 30:55.380* :  And they had specific clients that were looking for things like seals and things like that.
*30:55.900- 30:59.020* :  Tonyo hasn't heard anything from the FBI since then.
*30:59.020- 31:05.040* :  But we understand the US law enforcement agency located more than 260 gems,
*31:05.040- 31:10.740* :  believed to have come from the British Museum that were bought by a private collector in Washington, D.C.
*31:10.740- 31:13.880* :  We believe those gems are now back at the museum.
*31:14.500- 31:18.220* :  But the museum's recovery program is hindered by a lack of cataloging.
*31:18.640- 31:24.700* :  It doesn't have a record of many of the items, which means the museum hasn't yet been able to prove they were actually stolen.
*31:24.700- 31:30.140* :  Professor Harrison replaced Peter Higgs as the head of the Greece and Rome department.
*31:30.320- 31:36.880* :  We're looking at the registers, I'm old archive material, which includes receipts, lists that were made before the items came here.
*31:37.060- 31:41.020* :  The museum will now spend £10 million, fully cataloging its collection.
*31:41.020- 31:46.100* :  And it says it's on its way to recovering almost half of what it estimates is missing.
*31:46.100- 31:52.660* :  But it's likely gold, jewelry and other items have already been melted down and will never be recovered.
*31:53.540- 31:54.240* :  Katie Russell.
*31:55.460- 31:59.120* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
