*01:28.360- 01:34.220* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh and at 1,400 GMT on Monday the 20th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:34.760- 01:39.700* :  Iran has confirmed the deaths of President Ibrahim Reyesi and the country's foreign minister
*01:39.700- 01:44.600* :  in a helicopter crash. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is seeking an
*01:44.600- 01:50.360* :  arrest warrant for the U.S. Raley Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The UN's Human Rights Chief says
*01:50.360- 01:55.320* :  he's deeply alarmed by the destruction of one of the main towns in Myanmar's Rakhine state.
*01:57.860- 02:03.360* :  Also in this podcast, why Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky is extending his term in office
*02:03.360- 02:12.500* :  without calling an election. Iranians are coming to terms with the news confirmed early on Monday
*02:12.700- 02:17.640* :  that their president, Ebrahim Reyesi, has been killed in a helicopter crash in the remote
*02:17.640- 02:23.420* :  northwest of the country. Pictures from the scene show burned wreckage on a forested mountain side.
*02:24.260- 02:29.580* :  The country's foreign minister, Hussein Amir, Abdul Ahyan and several other officials were also
*02:29.580- 02:34.260* :  killed. This was her, the Iranians heard about the death of their president on national TV.
*02:36.080- 02:43.380* :  In the name of God, of Allah, the blessed Prophet Muhammad and the family of Muhammad,
*02:44.180- 02:49.140* :  in today's first news segment, we belong to God and to him we shall return.
*02:50.120- 02:52.380* :  The servant of Reza, the servant of the Iranian people,
*02:53.120- 03:00.540* :  Ayatollah Ebrahim Reyesi, the president of the Republic of Iran, was martyred while serving the
*03:00.540- 03:07.420* :  people of Iran. I heard more from J.R. Goll, a BBC person.
*03:07.960- 03:13.920* :  What we know so far is the weather condition was so severe. There was no visibility at all.
*03:14.160- 03:19.380* :  That's why the question was raised by many supporters of the President Reyesi, why he was put
*03:19.380- 03:25.800* :  under helicopter and fly away while in a normal circumstances it would never have happened even
*03:25.800- 03:31.560* :  for civilian people traveling on helicopter. They announced almost after 3am in the morning,
*03:31.560- 03:38.320* :  local time, his helicopter has been found. The rescue team have reached the crushing side and
*03:38.320- 03:43.940* :  have minutes later they announced they have recovered his body and also the foreign minister,
*03:44.400- 03:50.160* :  Amir Abdul Ahyan and also the governor of West Azerbaijan province, is a major province in
*03:50.160- 03:56.540* :  northwest of Iran and also the representative of Iran's supreme leader in Tabriz.
*03:57.060- 03:59.980* :  Unusual for two such key figures to be traveling together?
*04:00.400- 04:05.820* :  It is very unusual, but I think there were other ministers also in his convoy, but they were
*04:05.820- 04:10.520* :  traveling on different helicopters, many ministers. I think the reason most likely,
*04:10.520- 04:16.820* :  the foreign minister was with him because they were participating in a ceremony to open a dam
*04:18.000- 04:24.580* :  jointly with Azerbaijan. The President of Azerbaijan also was present there to open this dam and
*04:24.920- 04:29.180* :  is a sign of cooperation. Don't forget, in the past two years, the relationship between
*04:29.180- 04:35.200* :  two countries has been very bumpy road because Iran has accused Azerbaijan of supporting Israel
*04:35.200- 04:42.080* :  and this was a sign of mending relationships. So Amir Abdul Ahyan being their normal circumstances,
*04:42.080- 04:46.940* :  yes, why you put two prominent figures of the government on the same helicopter,
*04:47.660- 04:52.200* :  but obviously he was there because the prison of a neighboring country was there as well.
*04:52.560- 04:54.480* :  Now what's been the reaction in Iran?
*04:55.080- 04:59.960* :  Well, it's a very mixed reaction. If you look at those who are hard-liner and supporter of
*05:00.120- 05:07.120* :  supreme leader Ayatollah Hamne yesterday, they were praying for his safety and return back to Tehran
*05:07.120- 05:13.140* :  in one piece. But if you look at most people in Iran, if you look at on social media, many people
*05:13.180- 05:20.620* :  were making jokes and excited about the concept, he was killed. Don't forget, he was a very divisive
*05:20.620- 05:26.860* :  figure. Many people saw him as a one who was appointed by the Guardian Council, which is appointed
*05:26.860- 05:31.860* :  again, their members by supreme leader. He'd pretty much, he, they believed, he came to prominent
*05:31.860- 05:37.120* :  by an engineered election by the supreme leader. He'd been around since the very beginning of
*05:37.120- 05:41.740* :  the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Tell us how he climbed the power structure. Well, at the age of
*05:41.740- 05:47.160* :  20, at the very very beginning of the revolution, he became a prosecutor. He had a very important
*05:47.160- 05:54.080* :  role in putting to death many political prisoners, same his own age. And in the atheists, he was one
*05:54.080- 06:00.380* :  of the member of a committee appointed by the founder of Iran Islamic Republic Ayatollah Hamne
*06:00.380- 06:06.440* :  to deal with political prisoners, later this committee known as a death committee. They executed
*06:06.440- 06:13.300* :  more than 5,000 political prisoners in the atheists, that's why many called him the butcher of Tehran.
*06:13.440- 06:19.080* :  So the reality is, many families are sad he's gone, the family of the victim, they believe he
*06:19.080- 06:26.780* :  should have survived and faced justice in an international court. Gear goal. So what next for Iran?
*06:26.780- 06:32.500* :  And how resilient is the system that Mr. Ayisi's successor will inherit? For a look ahead,
*06:32.500- 06:38.660* :  I spoke to our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher. One of the things that was due to happen by
*06:38.660- 06:44.180* :  protocol has already happened announced by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Hamne, which is that
*06:44.180- 06:50.740* :  the vice president, Muhammad Makba, is taking over as interim president. This is during a period
*06:50.740- 06:57.240* :  of up to 50 days preparing for a new election. And the stress has been very strongly from the
*06:57.240- 07:03.300* :  Iranian authorities, from Ayatollah Hamne himself down, that Iranian people should be reassured
*07:03.780- 07:09.320* :  that the smooth running of the country will continue, that there won't be any shift or change
*07:09.320- 07:13.160* :  in the short term. That's very much the message they're trying to get across.
*07:13.920- 07:18.060* :  So if we're talking about the succession, who are the main moves and shakers that we should
*07:18.060- 07:22.800* :  be keeping an eye on? I mean, there's nobody who has been groomed in the way that Abraham
*07:22.800- 07:30.320* :  Ayisi was. He had two shots at the election, 2017, when he lost to the more pragmatic reformist,
*07:30.320- 07:35.580* :  Hassan Rouhani, and then he won in 2021. And there's no one who's been in that position
*07:36.300- 07:42.040* :  by the power elite, the hardline power elite. So it's going to be a little bit difficult in terms
*07:42.040- 07:47.540* :  of giving the profile, finding the person who will have that replacement, because essentially,
*07:47.540- 07:52.760* :  what the people around the supremely want is to have another hardliner, another person where
*07:52.760- 07:57.960* :  there won't be much light between the president and the man who's the ultimate decision maker,
*07:57.960- 08:02.020* :  which is a supreme leader. So the man who's the vice president, the man who's president
*08:02.020- 08:08.360* :  into her now, Muhammad Mughbah, he's a possibility, but he doesn't have a massive personal profile.
*08:08.840- 08:13.540* :  It would very much be probably some kind of gerrymandered election to try to get him there.
*08:13.820- 08:18.980* :  The Speaker of Parliament, Muhammad Calibat, he is a powerful figure who's been quite dominant
*08:18.980- 08:23.200* :  in politics for years, but whether he constitutionally will play that role, because as Speaker,
*08:23.200- 08:27.680* :  he's meant to oversee the elections, will he step aside from that and present himself as a candidate?
*08:28.240- 08:33.420* :  Then from potentially the more reformist side, you have a former foreign minister, Muhammad Zareef.
*08:33.780- 08:40.340* :  He, with Hassan Rouhani, was really instrumental in the move to try and have an agreement
*08:40.340- 08:44.900* :  over Iran's nuclear programme, but one that when President Trump was in power, he essentially
*08:44.900- 08:49.280* :  withdrew the US and we've seen things go from bad to worse since then. That was a very slightly
*08:49.280- 08:53.740* :  different era from what we've seen since. So these are perhaps through the main players,
*08:54.180- 08:57.500* :  but it's all up in the air at the moment, I would say, as far as candidates are concerned,
*08:57.500- 09:03.760* :  and the big question will be in the previous election 2021, I mean, no reformist, no one who didn't
*09:03.760- 09:09.900* :  have the impromptu of the power elite was allowed to stand. Will that happen again? Sebastian Usher,
*09:10.940- 09:15.580* :  the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has asked for arrest warrants to be issued
*09:15.580- 09:20.860* :  against three senior leaders of Hamas for their role in the October 7th attacks against Israel.
*09:20.860- 09:26.000* :  The call for arrest warrants against the three named officials, Yahya Sinwa,
*09:26.000- 09:33.180* :  Muhammad Diab, Ibrahim Al-Mazri, and Ismail Hanyeh, came as no surprise. But in a move which is
*09:33.180- 09:39.700* :  infuriated the Israeli government, the prosecutor, Karim Akhan, also issued this statement about
*09:39.700- 09:47.640* :  Israeli actions in Gaza. My office charges Netanyahu and Galant as call perpetrators
*09:48.560- 09:54.440* :  and as superiors in the commission of these alleged crimes. Israel, like all states,
*09:54.440- 10:00.840* :  has the right to defend its population. It has every right to ensure the return of hostages
*10:01.740- 10:07.800* :  that have been criminally and callously taken. Those rights, however, do not absorb Israel,
*10:08.600- 10:15.400* :  of its obligations to comply with international humanitarian law, intentionally causing death,
*10:15.400- 10:21.680* :  starvation, injury, and suffering to the civilian population, including so very many women and
*10:21.680- 10:29.420* :  children. Our criminal means to achieve military and political goals. That's what we allege.
*10:30.280- 10:35.640* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Dan Johnson, told us more. We've got a statement from the
*10:35.640- 10:41.000* :  office of the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, as well as those three senior
*10:41.000- 10:46.400* :  Hamas leaders. It names Benjamin Netanyahu and Yahya Galant, the Israeli defence minister,
*10:46.720- 10:50.360* :  and he says, my office submits that the war crimes alleged in these applications were committed
*10:50.360- 10:56.740* :  in the context of an international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine, and in a non-international
*10:56.740- 11:03.860* :  armed conflict between Israel and Hamas. Now, we have just in the last couple of minutes got a quick
*11:03.860- 11:08.840* :  response from a source close to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*11:08.840- 11:14.420* :  a source saying, this is a decision that if implemented would be a disgrace on a global scale,
*11:14.420- 11:19.920* :  there is no limit to hypocrisy. So I think it's clear there from sources close to Benjamin Netanyahu,
*11:19.920- 11:25.940* :  what the Israeli Prime Minister thinks to this application being made by the International Criminal
*11:25.940- 11:31.040* :  Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan. Important to note that this is not automatic,
*11:31.040- 11:35.200* :  it doesn't mean the arrest warrants are issued, it doesn't mean anyone's going to be arrested
*11:35.660- 11:40.880* :  in the near future. This is an application based on the evidence the chief prosecutor has collected
*11:40.880- 11:44.780* :  over the last few weeks and months, it will then have to be considered by judges at the International
*11:44.780- 11:50.320* :  Criminal Court. They will decide what happens next. Dan Johnson, to tie one now.
*11:56.280- 12:01.120* :  That was the sound of cannons being fired at a ceremony in Taipei for the inauguration
*12:01.120- 12:06.540* :  of the new Taiwanese President William Lai. The celebrations featured traditional outfits,
*12:06.540- 12:13.040* :  musical performances and dancing dragons. In his speech, Mr. Lai urged Beijing to stop its
*12:13.040- 12:18.460* :  military rhetoric against his country. He added that it was essential for Taipei to be ready
*12:18.460- 12:26.560* :  to defend itself. In the face of the many threats and infiltration attempts from China,
*12:26.560- 12:32.380* :  we must demonstrate our resolution to defend our nation and we must also raise our
*12:32.380- 12:36.800* :  defense awareness and strengthen our legal framework for national security.
*12:37.640- 12:42.800* :  Our Taiwan correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes, was at the ceremony and told us more about
*12:42.800- 12:47.640* :  what William Lai said. It's part celebration, part of celebration of Taiwan's culture,
*12:47.640- 12:54.420* :  its democracy, its society, its way of life here and it was part a fairly robust, I would say,
*12:54.420- 13:01.340* :  a robust, but cautious speech by Taiwan's new president, William Lai, Lighting Duh.
*13:01.760- 13:07.900* :  He very much followed the line taken by the previous president, Taingwen, in when he talked about
*13:07.900- 13:13.400* :  China. So, holding very firm to the idea that Taiwan, under its official name, the Republic of
*13:13.400- 13:18.980* :  China, is an independent sovereign nation and that it will stand up for itself against China,
*13:19.520- 13:23.620* :  but also that he's not going to change the status quo. So, looking to America, looking to Taiwan's
*13:23.620- 13:27.660* :  friends and allies and saying, look, I'm not going to do anything to change the status quo here,
*13:28.240- 13:35.420* :  I'm basically a safe pair of hands, you don't need to worry, and we want to maintain basically the
*13:35.420- 13:39.080* :  situation that has been here for the last eight years under President Tsai. So, this is more of a
*13:39.080- 13:45.000* :  continuation presidency than something completely new. As he takes office, Mr Lai will have to deal
*13:45.000- 13:50.420* :  with difficulties at home and abroad. Most notably, a Chinese president who lays claim to
*13:50.420- 13:56.280* :  the self-guffering island. So, how is Beijing viewing this inauguration? His Stephen McDonald.
*13:56.860- 14:03.540* :  The government in Beijing doesn't like the ruling party in Taipei. I mean, that's putting it mildly,
*14:04.380- 14:11.180* :  urged people in Taiwan to vote for not the DPP, didn't work. The kind of preempting is leadership,
*14:11.180- 14:16.560* :  if you like, by saying it's going to be terrible. Anyone who urges re-entification is going to be
*14:16.560- 14:22.380* :  persecuted in Taiwan, this type of thing. So, yeah, look at it from the messaging we're getting
*14:22.380- 14:27.340* :  from the Chinese government, it's just more of the same. Now, of course, another way in which they can
*14:27.340- 14:35.220* :  apply pressure is all the military flyovers, the jets, the ships coming close to Taiwan,
*14:35.220- 14:42.640* :  increasingly close, more and more tensions with fishermen on either side of the Taiwan straight.
*14:43.460- 14:48.420* :  And we might expect that being ramped up even more. And so we're in for a few more years of
*14:48.420- 14:55.820* :  tension, it would seem. Stephen McDonald. In the face of waning popularity and accusations by Russia
*14:55.820- 15:01.880* :  of lacking political legitimacy, the Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky is extending his term
*15:01.880- 15:07.220* :  in office without calling an election. Opinion Paul suggests the move, which is allowed because
*15:07.220- 15:12.700* :  his martial law was imposed when Russia began its full-scale invasion in 2022, has broad support.
*15:13.520- 15:19.020* :  But as our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse reports, some critics have silenced their arguments
*15:19.020- 15:27.100* :  for the sake of stability. Watching President Zelensky's inauguration day exactly five years ago
*15:27.100- 15:32.840* :  is like viewing a different Ukraine. The younger, fresher-faced comedian-turned-leader
*15:33.440- 15:39.240* :  enthusiastically greets crowds, no stubble, no stone expression. He had, after all,
*15:39.540- 15:42.860* :  just won a landslide victory with 73% of the vote.
*15:44.460- 15:49.140* :  Yeah, it was a very exciting day. Alexander Daniluk was on his team at the time. He was a
*15:49.140- 15:54.060* :  pointed secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, but left a few months later
*15:54.060- 15:59.420* :  because of political differences. None of us didn't expect what was ahead of us.
*15:59.500- 16:08.560* :  Russia's full-scale invasion meant Mr. Zelensky's election promise to negotiate peace with Vladimir Putin
*16:08.560- 16:16.140* :  had failed. Mr. Daniluk claims he believed Ukraine should have been preparing for an unavoidable war,
*16:16.140- 16:22.000* :  so does he regret supporting him? No, I don't. Zelensky was the person who actually had this
*16:22.000- 16:27.280* :  ability to reach to everyone across the globe. You bring these weapons supply. After turning down
*16:27.280- 16:31.940* :  office to leave, President Zelensky became the cheerleader in chief for his country's cause
*16:32.500- 16:38.860* :  and he'd never been more popular. We have no fear, nor should anyone in the world have it.
*16:39.640- 16:45.200* :  On the Bikurkov, a well-known Ukrainian writer and an avid observer of society once described
*16:45.200- 16:52.720* :  President Zelensky as the James Bond of the world. Now, President Zelensky looks like a very
*16:52.720- 17:01.020* :  tired James Bond, a much older and a bit grumpy. Still, majority of Ukrainians support him.
*17:01.480- 17:05.520* :  In peacetime, an election would have been called, but the martial law brought him with Russia's
*17:05.520- 17:11.360* :  full-scale invasion means that can't happen. If there is no alternative, so even if we have
*17:11.360- 17:17.620* :  elections tomorrow, it will be Zelensky again. There is, as Anton Hushetsky from the Key of International
*17:17.700- 17:22.920* :  Institute of Sociology points out, broad public support for elections being put on ice.
*17:23.360- 17:28.000* :  So, for the Ukrainians, it's a clear priority number one to be in the war and then to help an
*17:28.000- 17:33.420* :  election. How do you see the end of President Zelensky's turn? Do you have any idea what the public
*17:33.420- 17:37.960* :  will be looking for next? There will be a strong desire from the population to have new powers
*17:37.960- 17:42.620* :  because more and more people will be playing Zelensky for preparation for the war or some other
*17:42.620- 17:46.860* :  problems for some corruption, etc. Right now, he's a military leader and actually has brave
*17:46.860- 17:50.640* :  experts in that. In the beginning, it was very good for Ukraine. Right now,
*17:50.640- 17:55.520* :  Volodymyr Zelensky is focusing on the front lines instead of foreign travel. He recently handed
*17:55.520- 18:01.640* :  out medals to troops who were being forced backwards. So, how much longer should he go on for?
*18:02.000- 18:04.280* :  I ask his former ally, Oleksandr Daniluk.
*18:04.640- 18:08.600* :  The constitution says that the president of the parliament are legitimate and whoever tried
*18:08.600- 18:13.920* :  to question it actually plays an interest of Russia. And the president of Zelensky will leave
*18:13.920- 18:19.140* :  this war one way or another whether he likes it or not. That's the case. That's his destiny.
*18:21.140- 18:26.500* :  A day of political reckoning for Ukraine's leader is desired and will come. For now, he says
*18:26.500- 18:30.980* :  calls for an election are irresponsible and Ukrainians seem to broadly agree.
*18:33.680- 18:34.620* :  James Waterhouse
*18:37.600- 18:42.540* :  Still to come on this podcast, how to teach a computer to recognize sarcasm.

*20:19.060- 20:23.820* :  The UN's most senior human rights official says he's deeply alarmed by the reported destruction
*20:23.820- 20:29.840* :  of one of the main towns in Myanmar's Rakhine state and the expulsion of its Rohingya population.
*20:30.280- 20:36.280* :  Volkoturk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, warns that there was an acute risk of further
*20:36.280- 20:42.000* :  atrocities after military units in Rakhine surrendered to the insurgent Arakhan army.
*20:42.800- 20:46.160* :  More details from our south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head.
*20:47.000- 20:51.940* :  The Arakhan army is one of the most successful groups fighting against the military regime in Myanmar.
*20:52.540- 20:57.380* :  In the past six months, it's taken control of at least half of Rakhine state and captured
*20:57.380- 21:03.740* :  thousands of soldiers. But its latest victory in the town of Buttidong has raised fears over its
*21:03.740- 21:09.500* :  treatment of Muslim Rohingyas who make up most of the town's population. Local residents have
*21:09.500- 21:14.780* :  said they were told to evacuate Buttidong by the Arakhan army as it prepared to take control of it.
*21:15.240- 21:21.200* :  They say the entire downtown area has now been raised to the ground with tens of thousands of
*21:21.200- 21:26.840* :  Muslims forced to flee into the fields outside. The Arakhan army blames the distraction on
*21:26.840- 21:31.700* :  bombing raids carried out by the Air Force and says it is now helping those who fled.
*21:32.480- 21:37.660* :  The United Nations has appealed to all armed groups in Rakhine to protect civilians and give
*21:37.660- 21:43.780* :  access to humanitarian agencies. The Arakhan army is backed by much of the Rakhine Buddhist
*21:43.780- 21:49.600* :  population, some of whom took part in the attacks seven years ago that killed thousands of
*21:49.600- 21:56.400* :  Rohingyas and drove more than 700,000 over the border into Bangladesh. The insurgents, who say
*21:56.400- 22:01.360* :  they're fighting for self-rule in Rakhine, have in the past promised to respect the rights of the
*22:01.360- 22:07.120* :  Muslim population. However, the forced conscription of Rohingyas by the military this year to help
*22:07.120- 22:12.900* :  it fight against the Arakhan army has revived mistrust between the two communities, raising concern
*22:12.900- 22:18.180* :  over what will happen to Rohingyas living in the areas which are now controlled by the insurgents.
*22:18.660- 22:24.300* :  Jonathan Head. South Africa has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the world,
*22:24.760- 22:30.920* :  more than 30 percent across the whole adult population. That stretches to above 50 percent for young
*22:30.920- 22:35.820* :  people. As the country heads to the polls at the end of the month, it's an issue that could
*22:35.820- 22:40.000* :  determine how people vote as our correspondent Ansoy reports.
*22:54.220- 22:59.420* :  Details, their profile, all that information will go into a centralized government system
*22:59.960- 23:02.700* :  which employers can access when they have opportunities.
*23:03.340- 23:10.040* :  What is your name? My name is Mohsim Makwasa. I'm hoping to get job any job because I'm
*23:10.040- 23:20.040* :  test paris. My name is Amanda Shabalala and 27 years old. Way too many people are sitting at
*23:20.040- 23:26.360* :  home without jobs, including graduates. It's also not easy to start a business because we do not
*23:26.360- 23:33.040* :  have the money for it. Many live with their grandparents and rely on grants. Unemployment is too high.
*23:35.020- 23:39.760* :  The Ministry of Labor has been running jobs fairs like this one for four years. The Minister,
*23:39.760- 23:45.080* :  Tulas in LSE, tells me out of nearly four million people who have registered in their database,
*23:45.680- 23:50.680* :  just about a quarter of a million have been linked to jobs. There are historical structural
*23:50.720- 23:56.400* :  issues which are linked to education and skills development. ANC has been in power for 30 years.
*23:56.400- 24:02.320* :  There are South Africans who are born after appetite, who are feeling like this is a betrayal.
*24:02.320- 24:08.000* :  They just know jobs for them. A mass which has been created for over 200 years and to think that
*24:08.000- 24:13.880* :  when people refer to us as a young nation over 30 years we think that would be able to deal with
*24:13.880- 24:19.860* :  what's just been trimming, we will have to be systemic. Planned blackouts, known as Lord Shedding,
*24:19.860- 24:25.080* :  have limited productivity in manufacturing and mining, driven the cost of doing business up
*24:25.080- 24:30.960* :  and even services like health, education and water have been affected. New data showed that
*24:30.960- 24:36.700* :  over 300,000 jobs were lost during the first quarter of this year. I met two women who were
*24:36.700- 24:41.660* :  retrenched in a pro. It's very bad because I'm the breadwinner, so we don't know what you're
*24:41.660- 24:47.160* :  going to do, so we are struggling. How do you feel about the handling of government,
*24:47.160- 24:52.220* :  to hold this situation? Government has failed us. Are you going to vote? I'm going to vote,
*24:52.220- 24:56.260* :  but not for the ruling party at the moment because they failed us. They did nothing for us.
*24:56.580- 25:02.360* :  And what about you? I always voted for ANC but now I change my mind because they're not giving
*25:02.360- 25:06.240* :  us anything. Of course, I'm going to promise you that I can say.
*25:07.400- 25:12.300* :  The disappointment with the ruling ANC is huge, but the opposition remains untested.
*25:13.220- 25:17.580* :  South Africans make their choice in just over a week. And soy.
*25:19.140- 25:24.620* :  It's the story of the biggest gold discovery in history and the mysterious man behind its
*25:24.620- 25:31.700* :  multi-billion dollar downfall. In 1995, Canadian mining company Bri X announced to the world
*25:31.740- 25:35.760* :  that had found a significant amount of gold deep in the jungles of Indonesia.
*25:36.720- 25:42.560* :  Stock prices soared as investors worldwide fought to stake their claim. But when Bri X's
*25:42.560- 25:48.760* :  chief geologist mysteriously fell from a helicopter over the jungle, the story of the billion dollar
*25:48.760- 25:54.740* :  discovery began to unravel. Nearly three decades later, no one has ever been held accountable.
*25:55.640- 26:00.820* :  Now the Canadian journalist, Suzanne Wilton, revisits the story she just couldn't let go of
*26:00.820- 26:06.380* :  for a new podcast for the BBC World Service. She takes listeners from the jungles of Indonesia
*26:06.380- 26:12.740* :  to small turn Alberta and Canada to investigate what really happened and find out more about the
*26:12.740- 26:19.200* :  man behind the biggest gold mine fraud of all time. Suzanne, so you've spent the last two years
*26:19.200- 26:23.600* :  investigating the story for your podcast, the six billion dollar gold scam.
*26:24.160- 26:29.900* :  Yes, that's right. It's a story that started in 1993 from humble beginnings in the basement
*26:29.900- 26:34.680* :  of a Calgary home owned by a CEO of a small Canadian mining company called Bri X.
*26:35.320- 26:41.340* :  Then in 1995, they announced the discovery of substantial gold deposits in the jungles of
*26:41.340- 26:48.080* :  Indonesia. It was the largest the world had ever seen. Investors jumped at the chance to buy shares
*26:48.280- 26:54.120* :  and gold fever took hold. Let's hear from Warren Irwin. He was a hedge fund manager at the time.
*26:54.920- 27:00.860* :  There was a frenzy and a sense of greed that I have not seen since in the markets.
*27:01.300- 27:05.960* :  The level of greed back then was just unbelievable and the newspapers were jumping all over this
*27:06.060- 27:12.340* :  and pumping it too. So there was money, there was greed and there was sense of legitimacy
*27:12.340- 27:19.960* :  and the numbers being spouted were just huge. So what went wrong? They had sold a six billion dollar
*27:19.960- 27:26.280* :  gold discovery to the world. It was quite something for a small Canadian mining company in the 1990s.
*27:26.820- 27:32.380* :  But the gold they claimed to have found, well, it didn't exist. After another mining company
*27:32.380- 27:38.080* :  checked their results and realized it was folks, the chief geologist who discovered the gold
*27:38.080- 27:44.280* :  Michael Degusement jumped from a helicopter into the Borneo jungle. At least that's the official
*27:44.780- 27:49.120* :  story. Let's hear from Andrew Neil. He was a geologist from Freeport,
*27:49.120- 27:53.800* :  McMorrin. That's the company that uncovered the scam. He says, you're not going to believe this.
*27:53.800- 27:59.280* :  I said, what? He says Degusement just fell out of a helicopter. I said, no, no, no,
*27:59.280- 28:03.220* :  never. He said, no, that's what we're being told. He fell out of a helicopter.
*28:05.020- 28:09.660* :  He said, we really need to know what's going on here. I went to the lab guys. I said,
*28:09.660- 28:15.460* :  guys, we've got to work on this sample right now. I said, but strict protocols. I said, take off
*28:15.460- 28:21.440* :  any jewelry. Nobody wearing any gold chains. Nobody can put anything into it. Now they're sensing
*28:21.440- 28:27.180* :  the criticality of what's going on. And at this point, were investors scrambling to get
*28:27.180- 28:34.840* :  their money back? Actually, no. And this is why it's a story about greed, gold fever, and the lengths
*28:34.900- 28:39.060* :  people will go to in the pursuit of getting rich. Here's Warren or one again.
*28:39.760- 28:43.840* :  Friend of mine's wife said, oh, no, no, Warren, you're wrong. It's going way higher. And then I
*28:43.840- 28:48.080* :  had another buddy of mine. I said, remember that 9-11 Turbo you always wanted to buy? Well,
*28:48.080- 28:51.500* :  you've just made enough money on this to buy that dream 9-11 Turbo you wanted to buy.
*28:51.860- 28:55.200* :  Please buy it. He goes, no, no, Warren. It's going way higher.
*28:56.100- 28:58.460* :  Nobody would believe anything I had to say.
*28:59.520- 29:02.620* :  Was anyone ever brought to justice what became of the chief geologist?
*29:03.500- 29:09.120* :  No, no one has ever been brought to justice. But I've been investigating what really happened to
*29:09.120- 29:14.920* :  the man behind it all, Michael Degruzman. Was the body found on the jungle floor really his or
*29:14.920- 29:21.240* :  was his fall and elaborate exit strategy? We've come across new evidence, which brings us closer
*29:21.240- 29:26.200* :  to the truth. And to hear more on that story from the BBC World Service and CBC,
*29:26.720- 29:30.580* :  search for the $6 billion gold scam wherever you get your podcasts.
*29:32.100- 29:37.460* :  Now, here's a story I'm sure you're all really interested in. It's about how to spot sarcasm,
*29:37.460- 29:42.620* :  which is not easy for computers, voice recognition software and artificial intelligence.
*29:43.320- 29:47.780* :  And it matters because more and more of what we do is being mediated through conversations
*29:47.780- 29:55.380* :  with computers. As a result, AI is now being trained to spot sarcasm using a database of annotated
*29:55.380- 30:00.860* :  speech. The man behind the project is Matt Kohler from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
*30:00.860- 30:07.300* :  He spoke to the BBC's Johnny Diamond. Sarcasm, humour or hyperbole and politeness,
*30:07.800- 30:13.340* :  they involve the use of language and context to provide meanings, right? And humans are, for the
*30:13.340- 30:18.760* :  most part, reasonably good at understanding those kinds of pragmatic phenomena. And we recognize
*30:18.760- 30:23.480* :  this not from the words per se, but from the melody, so the way it is spoken.
*30:23.900- 30:28.600* :  Critically, no devices can compute when we're being sarcastic or when we're just joking.
*30:28.600- 30:34.820* :  The big challenge is data. So like all attempts to train an algorithm, you need a lot of data to do so.
*30:35.000- 30:40.960* :  And sarcasm data just can't be found in high enough quantities to do conventional machine learning
*30:40.960- 30:47.360* :  with it. So in this case, we trained our algorithm using a dataset called mustard++. That's
*30:47.360- 30:54.580* :  comprised of recordings from American sitcoms. Are you all right? I'll be fine. Is this about
*30:54.580- 30:58.600* :  Arnie? No, Blanche. She's upset because they keep changing the taste of Coke.
*31:04.460- 31:06.840* :  Oh my god. You almost gave me a heart attack.
*31:08.040- 31:13.580* :  Those recordings are annotated for sarcasm by experts. And we use those annotations as
*31:13.580- 31:20.800* :  training data for our algorithm. We are recognizing right now American sarcasm as a case study,
*31:21.160- 31:25.340* :  but only active American sarcasm. It's just a privilege to watch your mind.
*31:26.960- 31:31.340* :  This is really early days for advanced sarcasm recognition or more advanced human
*31:31.340- 31:35.720* :  machine interaction, but we have to start somewhere. We do intend to enlarge that dataset.
*31:36.320- 31:41.560* :  One challenge was the amount of data. We only had 1200 sentences that were annotated for sarcasm.
*31:41.560- 31:49.300* :  It's not really that much. Presumably, once computers can spot, identify highlights sarcasm,
*31:49.980- 31:56.840* :  they will also be able to deploy it. Yes. That's true. And I hesitate to talk about it because
*31:56.840- 32:01.560* :  people when they hear that, they think, oh no, I don't want my Roomba being sarcastic to me.
*32:01.980- 32:06.940* :  Smart voices, like smart homes, soon robots and other devices will permeate our lives,
*32:06.940- 32:11.740* :  whether we like it or not. And to build a relationship with our devices, it's important that
*32:11.740- 32:15.600* :  those devices understand when we're speaking sincerely, when we're joking,
*32:15.600- 32:20.160* :  they're castically or ironically, the fact is I still need to speak to my devices and a very
*32:20.160- 32:25.000* :  stilted kind of artificial mechanical way. And I think that having the devices
*32:25.660- 32:30.460* :  able to deploy nuanced language back at us in a way that's of course socially appropriate
*32:30.460- 32:34.620* :  and constructive can be useful. Professor of speech technology,
*32:34.620- 32:38.460* :  Matt Kohler speaking without sarcasm to Johnny Diamond.
*32:41.580- 32:45.940* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
