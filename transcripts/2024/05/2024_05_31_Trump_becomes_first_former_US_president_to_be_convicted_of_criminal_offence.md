*01:18.720- 01:22.760* :  You're listening to a special edition of the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.720- 01:28.200* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway and this edition is published in the early hours of Friday the
*01:28.200- 01:29.480* :  31st of May.
*01:30.060- 01:35.340* :  Donald Trump has become the first former US president to be convicted of a criminal offense.
*01:35.540- 01:41.260* :  The jury at his hush money trial in New York found him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying
*01:41.260- 01:42.200* :  business records.
*01:42.420- 01:46.900* :  He said the case was rigged and the real verdict would come in the presidential election
*01:46.900- 01:47.640* :  in November.
*01:48.200- 01:49.500* :  He'll be sentenced in July.
*01:54.360- 02:00.140* :  So Donald Trump has become the first US president in history, current or former, to be found
*02:00.140- 02:02.180* :  guilty in a criminal trial.
*02:02.740- 02:07.320* :  After more than 11 hours of deliberation, just as they were about to be sent home, the
*02:07.320- 02:10.940* :  jury sent a note to the judge to say they had reached their verdict.
*02:10.980- 02:15.420* :  Our correspondent Nettaalfik was outside the court as the result came through.
*02:16.240- 02:22.280* :  Donald Trump found guilty on count one, assuming we are going through the rest of those counts,
*02:22.940- 02:32.520* :  but already this is an absolutely historic Donald Trump losing this case, the jury finding
*02:32.520- 02:38.580* :  the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he tried to corrupt the 2016 election
*02:39.320- 02:44.020* :  by creating a conspiracy and then falsifying business records to cover it up.
*02:45.200- 02:50.280* :  Nettaal, that guilty on count two, assuming guilty on count three, let's remember.
*03:01.240- 03:07.240* :  Nettaalfik, outside the court in New York talking to Sumi Somerskander on BBC television,
*03:07.240- 03:09.000* :  as the verdict was read out.
*03:09.600- 03:15.520* :  Well in the end, the former US president was found guilty on all 34 charges of falsifying
*03:15.520- 03:16.500* :  business records.
*03:16.940- 03:22.140* :  It related to a hush money payment to pawn start Stormy Daniels before his election victory
*03:22.520- 03:23.560* :  in 2016.
*03:23.580- 03:28.680* :  A short while after the verdicts were read out, Mr. Trump emerged from the court to give
*03:28.740- 03:29.440* :  his response.
*03:46.620- 03:54.580* :  Again, this was a rigged, disgraceful trial that the real verdict is going to be November
*03:54.580- 03:59.740* :  5th by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here.
*04:01.020- 04:05.080* :  You have a sore respect, DA, and a whole thing.
*04:05.380- 04:06.640* :  We didn't do a thing wrong.
*04:06.640- 04:13.380* :  I'm a very innocent man, and it's okay, I'm fighting for our country, I'm fighting for
*04:13.380- 04:14.180* :  our constitution.
*04:15.180- 04:17.280* :  Our whole country is being rigged right now.
*04:17.280- 04:24.360* :  This was done by the Biden administration in order to move, to herd, and opponent to
*04:24.360- 04:30.100* :  political opponent, and I think it's just a disgrace, and we'll keep fighting, we'll fight
*04:30.100- 04:33.500* :  till the end, and we'll win, because our country's gone to hell.
*04:34.200- 04:37.420* :  We don't have the same country anymore, we have a divided mess.
*04:38.520- 04:42.960* :  We're nation-to-declined, serious, to climb millions and millions of people pouring into
*04:42.960- 04:50.240* :  our country right now, from prisons and from mental institutions, terrorists, and they're
*04:50.240- 04:51.380* :  taking over our country.
*04:51.620- 04:56.560* :  We have a country that's in big trouble, but this was a rigged decision right from day
*04:56.560- 05:01.640* :  1, with a conflicted judge who should have never been allowed to try this case, never,
*05:02.540- 05:04.520* :  and we will fight for our constitution.
*05:04.520- 05:06.780* :  This is Lord from over, thank you very much.
*05:07.260- 05:11.560* :  Donald Trump, former U.S. president, and now convicted felon.
*05:11.920- 05:16.440* :  Our correspondent in New York, John Sudworth, has covered the six-week trial throughout,
*05:17.060- 05:20.060* :  and from outside the court, he gave me his reaction to the verdict.
*05:20.620- 05:23.260* :  There's no doubt about it, it's momentous.
*05:23.380- 05:30.960* :  It was already history-making, the first ever criminal prosecution of a former U.S. president,
*05:30.980- 05:38.240* :  and now we have the first ever criminal conviction, Donald Trump, with the presidential election
*05:38.240- 05:44.160* :  just a few months away, is campaigning as a convicted felon.
*05:44.240- 05:51.600* :  The implications for him, for that election and the future of America, are clearly massive
*05:51.600- 05:56.220* :  as a result of this verdict, and a verdict delivered unanimously, as it had to be.
*05:56.220- 06:01.820* :  All 12 jurors had to agree on this, but guilty on all 34 counts as well.
*06:02.440- 06:06.160* :  The big question, of course, Oliver, is what the political implications are.
*06:06.780- 06:14.520* :  Many Americans' minds already made up on both sides, but the real thing that is very
*06:14.520- 06:19.900* :  difficult to factor in is what this will mean for those crucial undecided votes.
*06:19.900- 06:25.240* :  Will some of them now think twice if they were wondering about a vote for Donald Trump
*06:25.800- 06:32.520* :  about putting a cross next to a man who has a conviction and a criminal conviction behind him?
*06:32.920- 06:34.700* :  Yeah, a criminal conviction.
*06:35.420- 06:41.860* :  The sentencing, well, the hearing will be in July, but it seems unlikely that he'll go to jail.
*06:42.480- 06:44.500* :  Most observers think that is unlikely.
*06:44.500- 06:45.560* :  It's not impossible.
*06:45.560- 06:52.520* :  The judge on these charges, which are felony charges, has the option of a custodial sentence.
*06:53.200- 07:00.840* :  A lot of lawyers suggesting that if you look at similar cases where essentially bookkeeping
*07:00.840- 07:05.880* :  offenses, the falsification of accounts have been used to disguise a bigger crime.
*07:06.340- 07:11.540* :  If there's no violence involved, if it's a first-time offense, judges are often reluctant
*07:12.220- 07:15.480* :  to send people to jail, but of course it is not impossible.
*07:16.080- 07:20.120* :  But we've also got a factor into that, Oliver, that even if we did reach that point,
*07:20.560- 07:24.280* :  Mr. Trump will, of course, almost certainly appeal this verdict.
*07:24.780- 07:29.720* :  And if that appeal were to go ahead, then the likelihood is that even in the event of
*07:29.720- 07:33.720* :  a custodial sentence, he would be freed on bail while that appeal is ongoing, and that
*07:33.720- 07:39.280* :  would, of course, be very likely to push any further hearings down the line until after
*07:39.280- 07:39.860* :  the election.
*07:40.480- 07:42.700* :  And on that appeal, when might that happen?
*07:42.700- 07:44.120* :  Would it be before the election?
*07:44.580- 07:45.640* :  I think that's very unlikely.
*07:46.220- 07:51.320* :  Legal experts suggest possible grounds for an appeal throughout this case, the defence
*07:51.320- 07:57.820* :  have complained about pretty much every aspect of it, but they might choose to focus on the
*07:57.820- 08:04.580* :  evidence given by Stormy Daniels herself, which they would claim was so salacious, had so
*08:04.580- 08:10.540* :  much sexual detail that it was in itself prejudicial against Mr. Trump.
*08:11.020- 08:17.480* :  They might also choose to focus on what some have argued was the fairly complex nature
*08:17.540- 08:18.060* :  of the case.
*08:18.100- 08:23.900* :  The idea that the prosecution were using these false accounting charges, normally minor
*08:23.900- 08:28.800* :  misdemeanor offences, and elevating them to felony crimes because they said of that
*08:28.800- 08:34.580* :  wider conspiracy, that bigger purpose behind them of attempting to unlawfully influence
*08:35.080- 08:36.340* :  the 2016 election.
*08:36.740- 08:40.760* :  All of that, of course, will need, first of all, Donald Trump's legal team will need
*08:40.760- 08:45.240* :  to make their case for appeal, then the court time will need to be scheduled, it will need
*08:45.240- 08:45.840* :  to be heard.
*08:45.840- 08:51.780* :  I think if you look at the speed of his other cases, it is unlikely that we will get an outcome
*08:52.260- 08:53.280* :  this side of an election.
*08:53.600- 08:59.200* :  You never know, but, of course, for Mr. Trump, this is now, as it stands, something that
*08:59.200- 09:01.100* :  he has to deal with here in this moment.
*09:01.460- 09:06.320* :  And I think on that question, he is likely to use it, of course, to amplify that narrative
*09:06.320- 09:12.080* :  that he is somehow the victim here, that this is the product of a political witch hunt
*09:12.440- 09:17.560* :  and orchestrated attack on him, what they call the Republican movement here, have begun
*09:17.560- 09:22.260* :  to call law fair, the use of courts, much of those allegations, of course, made with
*09:22.260- 09:26.140* :  very little evidence, but it has become part of their narrative, and we are certainly
*09:26.140- 09:30.180* :  going to hear a lot more of that in the coming days and weeks, wherever this goes next
*09:30.180- 09:30.600* :  legally.
*09:30.980- 09:35.960* :  Some polls do suggest that even amongst some of those Trump supporters, a small minority
*09:35.960- 09:41.160* :  when polls suggest that they might shift their support, or at least question their allegiance
*09:41.160- 09:45.200* :  to Donald Trump in the event that he was convicted of a felony.
*09:45.200- 09:46.320* :  Well, here we are.
*09:46.720- 09:48.400* :  How accurate might those polls be?
*09:48.400- 09:53.400* :  How good are people at predicting their own motivations and their own likelihood of
*09:53.400- 09:57.460* :  being swayed at some point in the future, with the election still some months away?
*09:57.580- 10:02.340* :  We don't know, but in the end, this election will come down to politics the next few months
*10:02.340- 10:07.460* :  of campaigning that will absolutely dominate, perhaps rather than what's happened in the
*10:07.460- 10:09.880* :  court here today, as significant as it is.
*10:10.420- 10:15.220* :  John Sudworth in New York, well as Mr. Trump left the courthouse in his convoy he waived
*10:15.220- 10:19.840* :  to the crowd that had eagerly awaited the verdict, here's how two members of the public
*10:20.360- 10:21.600* :  responded in Times Square.
*10:22.440- 10:26.700* :  I don't know what to say, I did not think that this was actually going to happen and
*10:27.400- 10:32.120* :  I'm just, I can't believe it, it's about time, he was held accountable for something,
*10:32.120- 10:33.320* :  I can't believe it.
*10:33.700- 10:34.540* :  It's amazing.
*10:34.940- 10:36.200* :  It just takes you as a surprise.
*10:36.680- 10:40.820* :  It's an incredible surprise, I really didn't think he was ever going to get held to account
*10:40.820- 10:45.880* :  for anything, and then the jury really tried to hurt it, I'm like, I'm stunned.
*10:46.760- 10:51.460* :  Man, I don't think that's really true, I mean I don't know all the details about his
*10:51.460- 10:57.200* :  case, but I truly think he didn't bid it, didn't do it, my call, I pre-trial, I pre-trial,
*10:57.960- 11:03.800* :  and I just want to see the truth come out, and I just want to see the truth, truth evolve.
*11:04.640- 11:10.160* :  And that was a couple of people in New York, well inevitably, after the verdict there was
*11:10.180- 11:14.980* :  plenty of reaction, this was former Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman.
*11:15.640- 11:21.120* :  Yeah, I am not the least bit surprised, based on those two smoking gun notes of
*11:21.120- 11:30.440* :  Weiselberg and Makani, the two Trump organization employees, based on the self-inflicted wound
*11:30.440- 11:36.380* :  of putting Bob Castello on the stand as part of their defense, and based on what we heard
*11:36.380- 11:40.260* :  from the jury this morning in terms of what they asked for, they went right to the jugular
*11:40.840- 11:46.520* :  in terms of going to the core of the allegations here by asking for evidence to be read back
*11:46.520- 11:54.020* :  about the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower, attended by Trump, David Pecker from the National
*11:54.020- 12:01.960* :  Inquirer and Michael Cohen, and then asked for that conversation that was just between Donald
*12:01.960- 12:10.280* :  Trump and David Pecker in June of 2016, so it seemed that everything was going in that
*12:10.280- 12:12.980* :  direction, so I'm not surprised.
*12:13.660- 12:17.720* :  Nick Ackerman on the verdict, will the BBC also heard reaction from Richard Painter,
*12:17.720- 12:21.420* :  former White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration?
*12:22.120- 12:27.140* :  Well, this verdict was anticipated, the prosecution put on a very, very strong case.
*12:27.480- 12:32.700* :  The only question was about the credibility of Michael Cohen, who of course himself went
*12:32.700- 12:38.380* :  to jail and did lie, but there were lots of witnesses here, it was a very strong case
*12:38.380- 12:39.360* :  for the prosecution.
*12:40.080- 12:45.480* :  This is a prosecution by the Manhattan District Attorney, this is nothing to do with Joe Biden,
*12:46.300- 12:49.720* :  despite what the former president said outside the courtroom.
*12:50.780- 12:53.620* :  The case certainly will be appealed.
*12:54.000- 12:58.240* :  I doubt that any prison time would result from this conviction.
*12:59.140- 13:01.540* :  It's a serious matter, it's a felony.
*13:02.340- 13:08.360* :  I would urge that the Republican Party think very seriously about who they want to nominate
*13:08.360- 13:11.000* :  for president in the upcoming election.
*13:11.000- 13:19.580* :  I don't believe that most Americans would vote for a convicted felon of White House, and
*13:19.580- 13:23.480* :  there are plenty of other very good candidates who could run on the Republican ticket.
*13:24.620- 13:30.140* :  Donald Trump had this coming, he's engaged in financial shenanigans for a very long time,
*13:30.140- 13:35.680* :  he has a civil fraud verdict against him for several hundred million dollars.
*13:36.740- 13:42.160* :  He has been doing this for quite a while, and the only thing that surprises me is that
*13:42.160- 13:46.080* :  he didn't get hit with criminal charges like this a lot sooner in New York.
*13:46.540- 13:49.220* :  Richard Painter, former White House ethics lawyer.
*13:49.420- 13:54.260* :  Well some think Donald Trump may be able to turn this to his advantage, Reena Shah, is
*13:54.260- 13:58.600* :  a political analyst and former senior aide to two Republican members of Congress.
*13:59.060- 14:03.680* :  She says the former president can be expected to use the verdict in the presidential campaign.
*14:04.420- 14:10.260* :  But he's going to also promulgate every airway with is they did this to me and they'll
*14:10.260- 14:13.800* :  do it to you too, and that's the message he has for the American people.
*14:14.320- 14:18.600* :  But one thing is actually true, we have the empirical evidence to show that the Make
*14:18.600- 14:23.700* :  America Great Again faction of the Republican Party has not only dwindled in size, but it
*14:23.700- 14:25.120* :  has dwindled in influence.
*14:25.180- 14:30.480* :  And so that is something to take into consideration, is that sure the base is there, they support
*14:30.480- 14:33.980* :  Trump at every turn, but will the base turn out?
*14:34.420- 14:38.780* :  Will the party continue to support what will be a convicted felon?
*14:39.100- 14:45.040* :  This is a historic moment, yes, but the real question is, how will the Republican National
*14:45.040- 14:49.080* :  Committee and the leadership of today's Republican Party choose to move forward?
*14:49.080- 14:53.320* :  They have been a party that has rewritten the rules to stand by return.
*14:53.500- 14:59.060* :  So so much so that even a broker convention may not be a reality this summer.
*14:59.580- 15:01.500* :  This is a political analyst, Rena Shah.
*15:02.160- 15:07.420* :  As we record this podcast, the New York district attorney who prosecuted the case, Alvin Bragg
*15:07.420- 15:08.540* :  has just been speaking.
*15:08.540- 15:13.780* :  First of all, he thanked the 12 ordinary New Yorkers who served on the jury, and then he thanked
*15:13.780- 15:14.360* :  his colleagues.
*15:15.240- 15:23.140* :  While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial
*15:24.120- 15:29.840* :  and ultimately today at this verdict in the same manner as every other case that comes
*15:29.840- 15:37.720* :  to the courtroom doors by following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or
*15:37.720- 15:38.120* :  favor.
*15:38.740- 15:44.260* :  New York district attorney Alvin Bragg, let's take a look now at some of the key witnesses
*15:44.780- 15:45.500* :  in the trial.
*15:45.500- 15:47.600* :  Here's our correspondent Rachel Wright.
*15:48.180- 15:53.960* :  There was a whole host of colorful characters in this trial, so we start with Stormy Daniels
*15:53.960- 15:55.800* :  who was the adult film star.
*15:56.240- 16:01.340* :  She says she met Mr. Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada.
*16:01.580- 16:07.280* :  Ms. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was 27 at the time and a rising star
*16:07.280- 16:08.680* :  in the adult film industry.
*16:09.160- 16:14.660* :  She claims that Mr. Trump propositions her and the two had sex soon after their introduction.
*16:15.120- 16:21.520* :  Mr. Trump denies the encounter of course, but Ms. Daniels alleges that $130,000 hush
*16:21.520- 16:26.540* :  money payment was paid to her from Michael Cohen, a lawyer for the Trump organisation.
*16:26.540- 16:27.540* :  We'll talk about in a minute.
*16:27.820- 16:33.580* :  Just before the 2016 election to keep her silent about the encounter, since her allegations
*16:33.640- 16:38.680* :  became public, she's become a frequent target of Mr. Trump and his allies, but she's
*16:38.680- 16:44.300* :  remained committed to testifying and in fact she took the stand for two days, gave a very
*16:44.300- 16:45.640* :  dramatic testimony.
*16:46.100- 16:51.440* :  She provided such lurid details as John Sudworth was telling us about her encounter with Mr.
*16:51.440- 16:57.120* :  Trump that his lawyers called for a mistrial, Justice Juan Merchan acknowledged there were
*16:57.120- 17:01.860* :  some things that would have been better left unsaid and warned prosecutors not to ask
*17:01.860- 17:04.080* :  for specifics at such a personal nature.
*17:04.520- 17:09.620* :  She actually shared details about whether he wore a condom, that she spank Mr. Trump
*17:09.620- 17:13.900* :  with a magazine and got all sorts of information about Mr. Trump's wife.
*17:14.700- 17:19.760* :  Next to Michael Cohen was right at the centre of the trial, he was the fixer, he started
*17:19.760- 17:22.760* :  working for Mr. Trump in 2006.
*17:23.260- 17:29.540* :  He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018 over making the hush money
*17:29.540- 17:34.680* :  payment to Miss Daniels, but he maintains he sent the money at Mr. Trump's direction.
*17:34.680- 17:39.480* :  He told the court that the former president aimed to conceal the scheme and avoid scandal
*17:39.480- 17:44.940* :  by reimbursing him via a series of payments that were recorded as legal income.
*17:45.380- 17:50.540* :  Mr. Trump has called his former confident a liar and his legal team attempted to attack
*17:50.560- 17:51.760* :  Cohen's credibility.
*17:52.320- 17:53.260* :  Bratial right.
*17:53.260- 17:57.880* :  A reminder that you're listening to a special edition of the Global News Podcast with
*17:57.880- 18:03.200* :  the news that a jury has found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business
*18:03.200- 18:06.540* :  records in his New York hush money criminal trial.
*18:07.060- 18:12.460* :  Mr. Trump becomes the first president, current or former in US history to be convicted of
*18:12.460- 18:13.420* :  a felony.
*18:13.940- 18:18.920* :  Donald Biden has welcomed the verdict, saying it shows no one is above the law, but in
*18:18.920- 18:24.720* :  a statement issued by the campaign for his 2024 re-election, he reiterated that as the
*18:24.720- 18:29.880* :  presumptive Republican presidential nominee for November, Donald Trump continued to pose
*18:29.880- 18:35.240* :  a threat to democracy, and he accused him of running what he called an increasingly unhinged
*18:35.240- 18:38.040* :  campaign of revenge and retribution.
*18:38.280- 18:43.220* :  However, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, called
*18:43.220- 18:48.260* :  the verdict a shameful day for America and said Mr. Trump would appeal.
*18:48.260- 18:53.720* :  Well, our correspondent, Gary O'Donohue, was outside court as the verdict was read out.
*18:54.480- 18:57.520* :  This is a moment in the history of the United States.
*18:58.160- 19:03.360* :  The first time a former president has ever been found guilty of a crime and Donald Trump
*19:03.360- 19:11.300* :  has been found guilty by 12 peers, 12 women and men from New York of 34 separate counts
*19:11.300- 19:16.800* :  of falsifying business records in order to conceal another crime.
*19:17.280- 19:18.800* :  These are felony charges.
*19:19.300- 19:21.660* :  This makes Donald Trump a convicted criminal.
*19:22.140- 19:24.120* :  This gives him a criminal record.
*19:24.600- 19:28.720* :  Never before in the history of this country has that ever happened.
*19:29.360- 19:33.100* :  Gary O'Donohue at the court in New York, and as you could hear, some people in the park
*19:33.100- 19:38.740* :  opposite were celebrating, shouting, lock him up, others chanted in support of Mr. Trump.
*19:39.160- 19:44.040* :  The BBC's Kayla Epstein has been covering the court case every day, and was in court
*19:44.040- 19:45.520* :  when the verdict was announced.
*19:45.540- 19:48.920* :  She gave her assessment to my colleague, let it out for you.
*19:49.540- 19:54.020* :  So it was almost like the air turned to stone when they started reading out those guilty
*19:54.020- 19:58.860* :  verdicts one by one, and as each count in each guilty verdict rolled over him, Donald
*19:58.860- 20:01.980* :  Trump was completely motionless at the defense table.
*20:01.980- 20:06.160* :  I was sitting directly behind him and while I couldn't see his face, his body language
*20:06.160- 20:08.240* :  was some of the stillest I've ever seen it.
*20:08.640- 20:13.900* :  He didn't move, he didn't gesture, he just sat there as they said guilty, guilty, guilty
*20:14.720- 20:15.180* :  34 times.
*20:15.180- 20:21.320* :  I mean, these jurors sat through five weeks of testimony, prosecutors left absolutely
*20:21.340- 20:22.540* :  nothing to chance.
*20:22.540- 20:26.240* :  Ultimately, it took them 11 hours to come to this decision.
*20:26.240- 20:33.460* :  A decision that they knew would have a historic impact, not just on holding Donald Trump
*20:33.460- 20:37.360* :  accountable, but on a presidential election that is underway.
*20:38.060- 20:42.480* :  Looking at the jury, did you get a sense that they were overwhelmed by that moment?
*20:43.660- 20:48.820* :  The jury actually looked quite serious and they did look very somber, but they didn't
*20:48.820- 20:49.980* :  look overwhelmed to me.
*20:49.980- 20:54.640* :  They throughout the entire trial, they have looked like people who knew the weight of the
*20:54.640- 20:57.660* :  job that they had to do, but also were focused on their task.
*20:57.940- 21:03.080* :  And when the judge asked them to all go one by one and say what they believed, they all
*21:03.080- 21:06.960* :  said guilty, again, some not as loudly, but all in a clear voice.
*21:07.760- 21:13.880* :  I think it is struck all of us how Donald Trump publicly has slammed this judge as conflicted,
*21:14.360- 21:17.880* :  but Judge Mershawn has such a mild manner in the court.
*21:18.440- 21:23.620* :  When the verdict was read, what advice did he give to jurors when they had completed
*21:23.620- 21:24.740* :  their civic duty?
*21:25.680- 21:31.160* :  Justice Mershawn has been, you know, a real figure of authority and respect to the jury.
*21:31.280- 21:32.560* :  He speaks to them very kindly.
*21:32.560- 21:36.080* :  He makes sure that this doesn't disrupt their lives any more than it has to.
*21:36.580- 21:39.460* :  And when they were done delivering their verdict, he thanked them.
*21:39.500- 21:43.900* :  He said that he had watched as they deliberated he had watched how much care that they put
*21:43.900- 21:44.420* :  into it.
*21:44.640- 21:50.920* :  Let's turn back to Donald Trump, because as he left, he turned to his family in that
*21:50.920- 21:51.800* :  moment, didn't he?
*21:52.580- 21:56.900* :  The only family member who was in court with him today was Eric Trump, his second eldest
*21:56.900- 22:00.320* :  son, and his Trump got up and left the defense table.
*22:00.320- 22:04.540* :  He passed right by Eric who was sitting right in the front row, and he seemed to grab his
*22:04.540- 22:08.880* :  upper arm or his chest in almost like a moment of a fatherly gesture.
*22:09.480- 22:13.480* :  And while I don't know what was going through his mind or who was comforting, who he did
*22:13.480- 22:17.460* :  reach out for the closest family he had at that moment before he walked out of the courtroom
*22:17.460- 22:18.360* :  without saying a word.
*22:19.040- 22:25.380* :  But he made a comment that ultimately the real verdict is going to be November 5th in
*22:25.380- 22:26.000* :  the election.
*22:26.480- 22:27.420* :  You heard this evidence.
*22:28.000- 22:32.820* :  Was there any surprise that the jury did find Donald Trump guilty based on the evidence?
*22:32.820- 22:35.700* :  How overwhelming and compelling was it?
*22:36.600- 22:40.360* :  I wasn't in the jury room, and no one will know unless the jurors decide to speak what
*22:40.360- 22:42.420* :  went through their minds as they weighed the evidence.
*22:42.420- 22:47.700* :  But we do know that the prosecution told a very compelling, very cohesive narrative from
*22:47.700- 22:51.100* :  start to finish, from opening statements to closing arguments.
*22:51.260- 22:57.800* :  They brought dreams of evidence, text messages, emails, testimony from 20 people, most of
*22:57.800- 23:02.740* :  them key players in this case, and while we may never know what was the decisive piece
*23:02.740- 23:07.100* :  of evidence, they clearly dodged one of the biggest question marks in this case, which
*23:07.100- 23:10.800* :  was Michael Cohen's credibility, so much of this case hinged on him.
*23:10.860- 23:16.400* :  Clearly, the jury was able to see past Cohen's flaws and perhaps find their way to a guilty
*23:16.400- 23:16.760* :  verdict.
*23:17.620- 23:23.080* :  You know, we've seen Donald Trump's evolution here in New York from real estate mogul, reality
*23:23.080- 23:28.600* :  TV star, president ultimately, and now convicted felon.
*23:29.040- 23:34.700* :  For New Yorkers who are here who have called Donald Trump a con man, another than Robert
*23:34.700- 23:40.680* :  Daniero here for the Biden campaign just a few days ago, there were celebrations that
*23:40.680- 23:43.100* :  broke out in the park here.
*23:43.520- 23:48.440* :  Many coming out with statements including the Biden Harris campaign saying that Donald
*23:48.440- 23:53.640* :  Trump mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law.
*23:54.180- 23:56.620* :  American people face a simple reality.
*23:56.740- 24:01.600* :  The only way to keep Donald Trump out of the office at the ballot box, that from the
*24:01.600- 24:06.580* :  Biden campaign saying in New York today, they showed no one was above the law.
*24:06.580- 24:10.960* :  The White House saying, though, we respect a rule of law and have no additional comment.
*24:11.420- 24:17.700* :  Kayla, when you reflect on the campaign's ahead, how do you think Donald Trump will use
*24:17.700- 24:25.100* :  this verdict to try to get out of the political danger that he clearly faces with independent
*24:25.100- 24:25.600* :  voters?
*24:26.300- 24:30.540* :  We are going to be hearing about this verdict every day until election day in November.
*24:31.120- 24:33.860* :  Trump is going to use it to rally support from his base.
*24:33.860- 24:38.540* :  He has done a very good job of keeping his supporters close to him by making the argument
*24:38.540- 24:41.280* :  that they're really going after me because they're going after you.
*24:41.280- 24:43.640* :  They're trying to silence me because they're trying to silence you.
*24:44.240- 24:49.540* :  Meanwhile, we are going to see Joe Biden attacking Donald Trump's fitness for office based
*24:49.560- 24:50.280* :  off of this.
*24:50.860- 24:53.060* :  This is going to run through the entire election.
*24:53.100- 24:56.420* :  We talked about sentencing here in July.
*24:56.420- 25:00.840* :  That's right before the Republican National Convention where Trump will officially become
*25:00.840- 25:02.120* :  the Republican nominee.
*25:02.740- 25:04.820* :  And so this verdict will have ripple effects.
*25:04.860- 25:07.740* :  Now, can we get into the minds of individual voters right now?
*25:07.740- 25:08.480* :  We don't know.
*25:08.500- 25:13.580* :  But polling has shown that at least some voters might turn away from Trump if he actually
*25:13.580- 25:16.860* :  is convicted in one of his criminal trials as he has been here.
*25:17.300- 25:22.220* :  Kayla Epstein talking to Nettaalfik, both of whom have been covering the trial extensively.
*25:22.820- 25:27.340* :  Well, the big question is what are the political implications of this verdict?
*25:27.740- 25:32.380* :  Ryan Klaus is an associate professor in global politics at University College London.
*25:32.800- 25:33.820* :  Well, it is a historic day.
*25:33.860- 25:37.860* :  I mean, this is 34 felony counts for the person who's almost certainly going to be on the
*25:37.860- 25:39.360* :  ballot as the Republican nominee.
*25:40.180- 25:45.380* :  And the most astonishing thing is that he still has a chance to win and that the US Constitution
*25:45.400- 25:48.580* :  does not ban felons from serving as president.
*25:48.580- 25:53.860* :  So this will have shockwaves in terms of its political impact, and it does make it less
*25:53.860- 25:55.920* :  likely that he will win in November, I think.
*25:56.640- 26:02.260* :  But it is still clearly a viable candidacy, and it's a sort of barometer for how the
*26:02.260- 26:09.280* :  country has been so divided that even a convicted felon could actually win the presidency.
*26:09.640- 26:12.700* :  Basically, to understand this, you have to look at two different camps.
*26:12.700- 26:17.280* :  So among his base, who believes that he's persecuted, this will strengthen their conviction
*26:17.280- 26:20.700* :  that he is, in fact, the victim of a system out to get him.
*26:20.760- 26:22.520* :  So his base will be fired up by this.
*26:22.520- 26:24.140* :  He'll probably raise a lot of money.
*26:24.880- 26:27.140* :  But elections are decided by people in the middle.
*26:27.140- 26:30.400* :  They're decided by people who are undecided or are independent.
*26:31.100- 26:36.500* :  And the average person who's undecided does not look at 34 felony convictions after being
*26:36.500- 26:40.320* :  involved in an illegal hush money payment to a porn star and the cover up around it,
*26:40.320- 26:41.960* :  and think, that's my guy.
*26:42.600- 26:45.920* :  And as a result of that, I think that when you look at an election that's very close,
*26:45.920- 26:49.140* :  this is likely to reduce his support by a few percentage points.
*26:49.720- 26:51.460* :  And that's what the election will be decided by.
*26:51.460- 26:56.380* :  So the odds of Trump winning the election, I think, decreased as a result of this verdict.
*26:57.400- 26:58.880* :  He's still potentially could win.
*26:59.340- 27:03.460* :  But I think that this is definitely bad news for him, even as it may consolidate his
*27:03.480- 27:04.320* :  base even further.
*27:04.680- 27:05.580* :  Brian Klass.
*27:05.580- 27:10.220* :  Well, as we're hearing, this is a devastating outcome for the former president.
*27:10.220- 27:13.400* :  Donald Trump will be campaigning as a convicted criminal.
*27:13.940- 27:18.660* :  The verdict could energize his supporters, but in key swing states in the Midwest and
*27:18.660- 27:23.680* :  the Sun Belt, some voters may be unhappy about supporting a candidate with a criminal
*27:23.680- 27:24.320* :  record.
*27:25.180- 27:29.020* :  Our North America correspondent, John Sudworth, looks back at the trial.
*27:29.500- 27:31.520* :  You're looking at live pictures of the court.
*27:31.520- 27:35.220* :  President Donald Trump on his way back, and we will pick it up from here.
*27:35.220- 27:37.760* :  It is day two of the nasty storytelling.
*27:38.200- 27:43.020* :  From the start, there was an only in America feel to a trial that had it all.
*27:44.540- 27:45.840* :  The fixer turned foul.
*27:46.160- 27:52.520* :  Sex, scandal, and the shattering of political convention with the first ever criminal prosecution
*27:52.520- 27:54.380* :  of a former US president.
*27:55.340- 28:01.160* :  And now, the first conviction, Donald Trump, the jury found, paid money to a porn start
*28:01.160- 28:07.280* :  to cover up an allegation of an affair, unlawfully hiding it from voters just ahead of his 2016
*28:07.900- 28:07.920* :  election.
*28:14.960- 28:20.880* :  A few weeks before that victory, an explosive videotape was released, in which Mr. Trump said
*28:20.880- 28:25.820* :  he could do anything he wanted to women, including grabbing them by their genitals.
*28:26.660- 28:31.620* :  Not only was it seen as having the potential to seriously damage his candidacy, prosecutors
*28:31.620- 28:36.620* :  argued that it also raised the stakes over the other allegations of extra marital affairs
*28:36.620- 28:38.920* :  and sexual misconduct he was facing.
*28:38.920- 28:41.740* :  I have no idea who these women are.
*28:41.740- 28:47.620* :  On the campaign trail, he issued vehement denials, while acknowledging in speeches submitted
*28:47.620- 28:51.020* :  as evidence that the allegations could hurt his chances.
*28:51.340- 28:57.600* :  If I percent of the people think it's true, and maybe ten percent think we don't win.
*28:57.960- 29:00.480* :  Which is where Stormy Daniels comes in.
*29:00.900- 29:02.880* :  So he turned around and pulled his pants down.
*29:03.160- 29:09.520* :  A porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump in a Nevada hotel back in 2006, not
*29:09.520- 29:12.640* :  long after his wife Melania gave birth to their son.
*29:13.620- 29:17.900* :  He's always denied the affair, but with the presidential election just days away his
*29:17.900- 29:24.640* :  lawyer, a man called Michael Cohen, paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence.
*29:25.260- 29:29.740* :  Here she is being interviewed for CBS's 60 Minutes in 2018.
*29:30.160- 29:31.740* :  Was it harsh money to stay silent?
*29:32.320- 29:32.460* :  Yes.
*29:34.620- 29:35.880* :  The story was coming out again.
*29:36.840- 29:39.860* :  I was concerned for my family and their safety.
*29:40.180- 29:42.660* :  This was the crux of the prosecution's case.
*29:43.120- 29:47.960* :  They argued that Mr. Trump's reimbursement of Michael Cohen was improperly disguised
*29:47.960- 29:52.060* :  as legal fees, normally a minor misdemeanor crime.
*29:52.820- 29:57.940* :  But what made it a more serious felony crime, they argued, was that Mr. Trump knew the payments
*29:57.940- 30:00.560* :  were to improperly influence an election.
*30:00.780- 30:03.780* :  And furthermore, it was part of a pattern.
*30:04.240- 30:08.520* :  The court heard a secret recording Mr. Cohen made of a conversation with his boss.
*30:19.700- 30:24.960* :  In which the prosecution said, a harsh money payment to another woman was being discussed.
*30:25.680- 30:30.920* :  In the end, the jury were clearly convinced by those arguments, despite the best efforts
*30:30.920- 30:37.320* :  of the defense to discredit Mr. Cohen, portraying him as a bitter, compulsive liar, motivated
*30:37.320- 30:43.280* :  by revenge as a result of his own conviction and jailing in 2018 on tax offenses as well
*30:43.280- 30:49.080* :  as the payment to Stormy Daniels, illustrating their point by playing the jury a clip from
*30:49.080- 30:52.240* :  one of Mr. Cohen's podcasts, broadcast last year.
*30:52.860- 30:55.460* :  I truly hope that this man ends up in prison.
*30:56.000- 31:01.200* :  It won't bring back the year that I lost or the damage done to my family, but revenge
*31:01.200- 31:02.780* :  is a dish best served cold.
*31:03.060- 31:08.920* :  But the prosecution hadn't tried to hide Mr. Cohen's criminal convictions or his history
*31:08.920- 31:09.500* :  of lying.
*31:10.420- 31:15.560* :  Instead, they argued that was the whole point he'd been lying in the payoff and under the
*31:15.560- 31:17.460* :  instruction of Mr. Trump.
*31:18.100- 31:19.440* :  The jury, it seems agreed.
*31:19.640- 31:20.800* :  There's somebody here.
*31:22.800- 31:28.240* :  Throughout the trial, Donald Trump has repeated endlessly, without evidence, his claim that
*31:28.240- 31:33.260* :  it was nothing more than a plot, directed against him by President Joe Biden to keep
*31:33.260- 31:34.120* :  him from power.
*31:35.140- 31:39.500* :  Leaving aside the great irony of such a claim coming from a man who tried to cling to
*31:39.500- 31:46.140* :  power in 2021, despite losing comprehensively to that same opponent, it's likely to grow
*31:46.140- 31:47.600* :  even louder now.
*31:48.600- 31:54.240* :  So while Mr. Trump's self-image as a political martyr may well rally his base, there's one
*31:54.240- 31:58.020* :  big unknown, those crucial, undecided voters.
*31:58.920- 32:03.940* :  How much might this verdict delivered by 12 ordinary citizens assembled in a humdrum
*32:03.940- 32:10.260* :  New York courtroom make some of them think twice about voting for a convicted felon
*32:10.260- 32:11.060* :  as president?
*32:11.780- 32:16.740* :  John Sudworth, on the day that Donald Trump became the first US president in history,
*32:16.740- 32:20.620* :  borrowed all former to be found guilty in a criminal trial.
*32:23.320- 32:27.140* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:27.560- 32:31.640* :  This edition was mixed by Nicky Brough, the producer was Richard Hamilton, our editor
