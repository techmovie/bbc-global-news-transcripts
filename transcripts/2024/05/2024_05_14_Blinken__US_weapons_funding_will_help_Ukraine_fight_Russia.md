*01:33.800- 01:39.800* :  I'm Paul Moss and at 1400 hours GMT on Tuesday 14th of May these are our main stories.
*01:40.580- 01:45.100* :  The US Secretary of State is in Kiev where he's told President Zelensky the new
*01:45.100- 01:48.460* :  American's weapons package will bolster Ukrainian forces.
*01:49.440- 01:54.020* :  Georgia's parliament has adopted a controversial new law that's prompted mass protests
*01:54.820- 02:01.060* :  and a tie activist detained for insulting the monarchy has died in prison after going on hunger strike.
*02:03.980- 02:08.800* :  Also in this podcast. It seems like I'm looking at a picture of a wooden surface.
*02:09.100- 02:12.900* :  Oh you know what? That was the thing I sent you before. Don't worry. I'm not actually a table.
*02:12.900- 02:18.980* :  Okay so take a take another look. A new and more interactive version of chat GPT is launched.
*02:25.380- 02:29.600* :  He's there to provide a strong sense of reassurance. The US official said
*02:29.600- 02:35.440* :  the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is in Ukraine a surprise visit and his first stop was
*02:35.440- 02:40.900* :  the presidential palace in Kiev to meet Vladimir Zelensky. Mr Blinken described this as a
*02:40.900- 02:45.500* :  difficult moment for Ukraine and that would certainly be hard to disagree with. Russian troops
*02:45.500- 02:51.140* :  are continuing to advance in the country's northeast where fighting is fierce but Mr Blinken
*02:51.140- 02:56.820* :  insisted that new arms deliveries from the US would make a crucial difference. The assistance
*02:56.840- 03:03.400* :  is now on the way. Some of it's already arrived more that will be arriving and that's going to
*03:03.400- 03:07.800* :  make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on the battlefield and we're
*03:07.800- 03:13.480* :  determined along with many other partners for Ukraine to make sure that you succeed on the battlefield.
*03:14.100- 03:19.200* :  The warm words are no doubt welcome but what can the US Secretary of State actually achieve by
*03:19.200- 03:24.060* :  visiting Ukraine at this point? Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman is traveling with
*03:24.060- 03:28.980* :  Mr Blinken. I was with him when he met the Ukrainian president. Mr Zelensky he said
*03:29.400- 03:33.700* :  didn't seek to downplay the present crisis. It was notable I thought how much
*03:33.700- 03:39.620* :  President Zelensky referenced the fact that this was in his words a challenging time, a tough
*03:39.620- 03:46.600* :  period he talked about for warriors in the east of the country but he thanked Mr Blinken for what
*03:46.600- 03:52.160* :  he called the bipartisan support with the military assistance package that was passed by Congress
*03:52.600- 03:58.520* :  last month. That has been desperately divided by the Ukrainians. Mr Blinken also referenced the fact
*03:58.520- 04:03.680* :  that it was a challenging moment but he said the two countries have been on a long journey
*04:04.180- 04:09.560* :  together and since then they've been in these talks and I think this will be a key moment
*04:09.560- 04:15.760* :  in Mr Blinken's visit here after what was a very early arrival by train this morning. We arrived
*04:15.760- 04:21.200* :  by sleeper all the way from the Polish border here into Kiev. Those crucial weapons of the United
*04:21.200- 04:25.760* :  States has now said it's going to be sending or with other military aid to sending to Ukraine.
*04:26.240- 04:29.520* :  Do we know exactly how much has arrived and how much of those
*04:29.980- 04:33.960* :  really necessary weapons are there that the Ukrainians say are desperately needed at the moment?
*04:34.020- 04:40.040* :  We don't know the quantities but what a senior US official has said in the run-up to the trip here
*04:40.040- 04:45.960* :  is that some of these weapons have started to arrive on the front line and that comes within
*04:46.460- 04:51.720* :  you know just a three-week period when that 61 billion dollar assistance package was passed by
*04:51.720- 04:56.820* :  Congress. So some of the things we know that they needed the most that they are now getting from
*04:56.820- 05:05.260* :  that package are artillery shells crucially but also long-range precision-guided missiles. Now
*05:05.260- 05:09.500* :  these are something that the White House made clear within the last few months that they had
*05:09.500- 05:16.140* :  started to deliver to the Ukrainians and they're now likely to get a lot more I think because of
*05:16.140- 05:21.220* :  that military assistance package. The other thing we heard from Vladimir Zelensky is their crucial
*05:21.220- 05:26.760* :  need for more air defenses and he described this as Ukraine's greatest deficit. Talks about for
*05:26.760- 05:32.500* :  example the need for another two US Patriot missile defense systems in Harkiv you know in the
*05:32.500- 05:36.740* :  area that you've been talking about that's undergone this surprise Russian assault in the last
*05:37.300- 05:41.780* :  four days. So they still critically need those weapons that you have official saying that
*05:42.080- 05:47.980* :  they are among those armaments that have been delivered since the military aid package was passed
*05:49.240- 05:55.220* :  Tom Bateman as we record this podcast news has come in the Georgia's parliament has approved a
*05:55.220- 06:00.240* :  bill on foreign agents which has provoked a political crisis in the country. There have been
*06:00.240- 06:05.980* :  scuffles in the parliament and protests outside it. The new law would force civil society groups
*06:05.980- 06:11.740* :  and media organizations to declare foreign funding. Opponents fear it will be used to silence
*06:11.740- 06:16.960* :  dissent. I asked our Europe regional editor Danny Eberhardt whether there were any more hurdles
*06:16.960- 06:22.420* :  or this meant the bill would definitely now pass into law. Well it is in terms of that was the
*06:22.420- 06:28.540* :  third reading but it goes now to the president, Georgia's president Salemeza Rabishvili and she
*06:28.540- 06:33.980* :  has promised to veto it. She's very much in favor of Georgia joining the EU she thinks it will
*06:33.980- 06:38.760* :  get in the way of that process and then it has to go back to parliament and the governing
*06:38.760- 06:45.520* :  Georgian Dream Party has enough support in parliament to override her veto so I think from here on
*06:45.520- 06:50.920* :  in it it's effectively going to pass but the protests will continue for sure. There is a large
*06:50.920- 06:56.340* :  amount of people outside they've been chanting they've been waving EU flags, US flags so those
*06:56.340- 07:01.700* :  protests will continue. There's a huge security presence in the city, right police, water cannon
*07:01.700- 07:06.420* :  station in the centre of Tbilisi and it's possible that those could turn violent later.
*07:06.820- 07:10.980* :  I've talked so about, we've talked about the controversy of this law within the country
*07:10.980- 07:15.800* :  in the bitter battles but of course it's had a lot of criticism internationally this bill.
*07:15.800- 07:21.140* :  What's going to be the effect of it being passed? Well we've already had the EU speaking yet again
*07:21.140- 07:28.580* :  on this the spokesperson has said that it would be a serious obstacle for Georgia and its European
*07:29.360- 07:34.360* :  perspective. Georgia as you remember at the end of last year was given candidates'
*07:34.360- 07:40.780* :  state to see for a status for membership so that was seen as a big success on the Georgian front
*07:40.780- 07:47.680* :  but it threatens that. The Kremlin however says that the Western powers, not just the EU, the US as well
*07:47.680- 07:54.040* :  it says they're meddling in domestic Georgian politics. Now the Georgian- Something Russia would
*07:54.040- 08:01.860* :  never do of course. It is obviously moved in on Abkhazia and South Asetia and taken control of
*08:01.860- 08:08.100* :  parts of Georgia so we wait to see basically the next steps on this whether there is any particular
*08:08.100- 08:12.680* :  kind of violence or whether confrontation between the president and the Georgian-Treen party.
*08:14.760- 08:21.080* :  Today is Israel's national day marking its Declaration of Independence on 14th of May 1948.
*08:21.840- 08:27.100* :  As part of the celebrations each year the annual Israel Prizes awarded the country's highest
*08:27.100- 08:32.600* :  honour but this year the choice of winner has caused something of a stir. Isle Valdman made a
*08:32.600- 08:38.980* :  fortune from tech and he's given much of it away but he's also an arch critic of Israel's Prime Minister
*08:38.980- 08:46.340* :  Benjamin Netanyahu who he accuses of deliberately undermining Israeli democracy. Valdman also lost
*08:46.340- 08:52.220* :  his own daughter during the attacks by Hamas on October 7th and blames the Prime Minister for his
*08:52.220- 08:56.320* :  role in allowing the tragedy to happen. The BBC's We're a Davis reports.
*08:59.300- 09:05.920* :  Across Israel yesterday sirens rang out to mark Memorial Day. The solemn day of national unity
*09:05.920- 09:13.640* :  when a country so often at the front line honours its war dead but at some events unity turned to
*09:13.640- 09:21.820* :  anger. Families of hostages still being held in Gaza shouted at right-wing ministers who they say
*09:21.820- 09:29.060* :  have abandoned their loved ones in pursuit of a drawn out military campaign. After seven months of war
*09:29.660- 09:33.720* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hemorrhaging support.
*09:35.020- 09:39.560* :  I believe Netanyahu has to go. I think every day he's still the Prime Minister. It's the wrong
*09:39.560- 09:45.720* :  thing. It's bad for his run. A. L. Valdman lost his 24-year-old daughter Daniel, killed by Hamas
*09:45.720- 09:52.620* :  Gunman at the Nova Music Festival. The billionaire, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist agrees that
*09:52.620- 09:59.520* :  Hamas must be defeated but says the Prime Minister of 15 years increasingly reliant on religious
*09:59.520- 10:05.980* :  and right-wing nationalist support should accept responsibility for what happened on October 7th
*10:06.360- 10:11.400* :  and a war that is losing focus. It's not like me, you know, if the U.S. President has said it's very
*10:11.400- 10:16.640* :  hard for them to work with this kind government. In Germany and the UK are saying it's hard for
*10:16.640- 10:21.360* :  us to work with Netanyahu and the government. If you're the head of the state, the Prime Minister,
*10:21.360- 10:27.520* :  you can shake off your responsibility for what happened. Netanyahu supported, make Hamas stronger
*10:28.120- 10:34.260* :  and I think it's the right time for him to understand and call for elections and obviously take
*10:34.260- 10:39.040* :  responsibility for what happened in October 7th. Even before the war, Valdman was a thorn in the
*10:39.040- 10:45.080* :  side of Netanyahu's government, campaigning against controversial proposals to weaken the supreme
*10:45.080- 10:51.420* :  court. When he was nominated by an independent committee for this year's prestigious Israel prize,
*10:52.000- 10:57.560* :  it was widely reported that Netanyahu's allies tried to block him, calling for this year's
*10:57.560- 11:07.180* :  awards to be cancelled because of the war. Israel is increasingly divided on the same day that
*11:07.180- 11:13.020* :  anti-government protestors made their feelings clear. Right-wing youths were ransacking
*11:13.020- 11:20.560* :  Aatrox taking supplies into Gaza. Hanakh Milvitsky is a member of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
*11:20.560- 11:27.280* :  for Benjamin Netanyahu's liquid party. He says there's no truth in the notion that the Prime Minister
*11:27.280- 11:33.560* :  would crudely interfere with awarding a prize to a political opponent and says there is still
*11:33.560- 11:39.220* :  broad support for the government's war aims. I don't think that there's a growing movement
*11:39.220- 11:45.160* :  opposing the war. I think there's a growing movement in the Israeli media trying to oppose the
*11:45.160- 11:51.040* :  war because the Israeli media are very critical of the government and want to see a different
*11:51.040- 11:56.440* :  government in Israel. I don't think the state of Israel can allow itself to stop the war
*11:56.720- 12:02.580* :  when the people that committed October 7th are still in power in Gaza. That cannot happen.
*12:04.780- 12:10.920* :  But at home underbroad the protests grow. When this war eventually ends there will be an inquiry
*12:11.540- 12:15.640* :  and most observers believe elections sooner rather than later.
*12:16.600- 12:22.280* :  Isle Waldman who says he's proud of his Israel prize is still contemplating his future
*12:22.860- 12:29.640* :  as a grieving father who still believes in coexistence and the possibility of a region free
*12:29.640- 12:35.580* :  from conflict. We're a Davis. One of Thailand's best-known political activists,
*12:35.580- 12:41.420* :  Netiporn Senesankom, has died in prison after being on hunger strike for 110 days.
*12:42.080- 12:47.680* :  She was in prison facing charges of defaming the monarchy, an offense punishable by up to 15
*12:47.680- 12:52.300* :  years in jail. As healthy Stasia correspondent Jonathan Hedd told me from Bangkok,
*12:52.300- 12:59.620* :  first how Netiporn came to prominence. She's part of a generation of younger ties who during
*12:59.620- 13:05.320* :  the military government that came in under a coup in 2014 really had a change, a complete change
*13:05.320- 13:09.900* :  of view about their country and started and they were the first generation to do it to question
*13:09.900- 13:14.620* :  this sort of sacred role of the monarchy. It's enormous power and wealth and there was a
*13:14.620- 13:20.200* :  tremendous wave of protests in 2020, a very unusual year because of COVID, but because of a number
*13:20.200- 13:24.000* :  of other reasons. We had about five or six months of them here in Bangkok where unprecedented
*13:24.000- 13:29.680* :  demands were made. She was one of the most hard-line and most demanding of all of the activists.
*13:29.680- 13:35.060* :  And when those protests died down, she kept up her activism, kept on sort of various
*13:35.060- 13:40.020* :  attempts to try and get people to question the monarchy. That's why she was charged. There are
*13:40.020- 13:45.840* :  270 people who have been charged under this absolutely ferocious laissez-majestic law since 2020.
*13:45.900- 13:52.240* :  She was denied bail and her hunger strike when she was jailed in January over this bail denial
*13:52.740- 13:56.620* :  was very much a protest against that and against the whole wider judicial system in Thailand,
*13:56.620- 14:02.140* :  which makes any kind of critical comment about the monarchy, a criminal offense. She had declined
*14:02.140- 14:06.320* :  in health, but according to the prison authorities, they say she'd actually started eating and
*14:06.320- 14:11.320* :  drinking again last month and then suddenly this morning she suffered a cardiac arrest and so
*14:11.320- 14:15.500* :  they were unable to arrive and there will be a post-mortem tomorrow morning and the government
*14:15.580- 14:19.480* :  is handling this quite carefully. It knows that there'll be a lot of anger about this. It's
*14:19.480- 14:24.060* :  inviting her family to come and see the whole process for the post-mortem to try and understand
*14:24.060- 14:29.640* :  why she dies. She was only 28 years old. Jonathan, when the current king came to the throne,
*14:29.700- 14:34.660* :  I remember there was some speculation that they might loosen those terribly strict laws you
*14:34.660- 14:39.000* :  mentioned about insulting the monarchy, but listening to you, it doesn't sound like that's
*14:39.000- 14:43.720* :  very likely to happen at all. Well, it did happen. The new king, although he was a far less
*14:43.720- 14:48.060* :  popular figure than his father had been, seemed to understand that the laissez-majestic law
*14:48.060- 14:52.020* :  often made the monarchy look bad and initially that was what he did. He didn't use the law
*14:52.020- 14:56.520* :  for about two years, but these protests that started four years ago was so unprecedented
*14:56.520- 15:00.720* :  and such a shock to the monarchy. There was so outspoken in their demands to reform.
*15:00.720- 15:05.380* :  They started implementing the law again on an extent that they've never done before. It's
*15:05.380- 15:12.300* :  been very widely used. In a sense, any comment about the monarchy has been completely stifled. I
*15:12.300- 15:17.500* :  remember the party that won the general election in time and last year was banned from forming
*15:17.500- 15:21.600* :  a government. It was blocked from forming a government because it said, and it wasn't asking for
*15:21.600- 15:25.840* :  the laissez-majestic law to be abolished just to soften the punishments. We saw one man jailed
*15:25.840- 15:31.600* :  for 50 years earlier this year for his comments on the monarchy online. So you can see why so many
*15:31.600- 15:35.720* :  young people feel it's still an issue that has to be addressed even though the laws are making
*15:35.720- 15:41.640* :  that extremely difficult. Jonathan Head. Now to India, where a general elections underway and
*15:41.640- 15:47.140* :  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign pledges on the economy, have raised concerns they could
*15:47.140- 15:53.180* :  put a strain on precious resources like water. The fast growing city of Bengaluru is one that could
*15:53.180- 15:58.460* :  be affected. It's only just seen. It's very first rains of the year. From there, the BBC's James
*15:58.460- 16:05.640* :  Kamarassami reports. We're heading out to the eastern edges of this rapidly expanding city
*16:06.260- 16:11.680* :  in what appears to be an almost permanent rush hour. All around are signs of construction and huge
*16:11.680- 16:18.220* :  glass-fronted buildings which belong to tech companies attracted to this the Silicon Valley of
*16:18.220- 16:24.120* :  the East. But this rapid expansion as well as bringing opportunities has also brought huge
*16:24.120- 16:27.840* :  challenges. And Bengaluru is suffering from a major water shortage.
*16:29.260- 16:35.540* :  Hi, I'm Zibi and I'm a community volunteer. Zibi is part of a residence group in Whitefield,
*16:35.540- 16:41.780* :  a Bengaluru suburb that's prospered and modernised with the IT boom. But unlike central Bengaluru
*16:41.780- 16:46.860* :  which pumps in water from the state's main Kaveri river, around 100 kilometres away,
*16:46.860- 16:50.740* :  these residents rely largely on groundwater for their supplies.
*16:51.200- 16:56.680* :  There is a crisis happening in Bengal and the outer areas which are not serviced by a Kaveri,
*16:57.000- 17:00.640* :  the population has increased to this point that we are having this crisis.
*17:01.420- 17:03.040* :  We don't have any sufficient of water.
*17:03.580- 17:09.080* :  Shashay Kumar is one of those filling the gaps. His six multi-coloured vehicles make up one of the
*17:09.080- 17:14.740* :  many private fleets of water trucks that rumble through the city's park streets. They usually
*17:14.740- 17:18.700* :  filled from the four wells that he's drilled in a dusty parking lot.
*17:23.080- 17:29.180* :  But as one of his drivers fills a 6,000 litre truck, he tells us that two of his wells have run dry
*17:29.700- 17:34.800* :  so he's had to hike prices and that's led to accusations that he is part of a water mafia.
*17:38.320- 17:43.400* :  We set off on a delivery journey with a cab's eye view of the city on the roads in front of us
*17:43.400- 17:46.740* :  dozens of water trucks and tractors pulling water containers.
*17:46.740- 17:50.940* :  The fact they're all needed speaks to a wider problem says Sunita Narein,
*17:50.940- 17:53.840* :  director of the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi.
*17:54.200- 18:00.280* :  So Bangalore is a classic case. It's a case of every Indian city and I would argue with you,
*18:00.280- 18:09.300* :  it's a case of every city in the world which has had the arrogance of thinking that it can
*18:09.300- 18:15.960* :  bring water from longer and longer distances. Now this is where Bangalore like Cape Town,
*18:15.960- 18:24.660* :  like Delhi and like I would argue even London needs to rethink, seriously rethink water in times
*18:24.660- 18:29.240* :  of climate change. Sunita Narein ending that report by James Kumarasami.
*18:32.960- 18:37.140* :  Still to come in this podcast? You don't really know how you're going to react until you're
*18:37.140- 18:42.520* :  in that situation but how do you fight off a crocodile? It was terrifying.
*18:43.220- 18:47.860* :  How a British woman saved her twin sister quite literally from the jaws of death.
*18:56.820- 19:01.460* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*19:01.460- 19:06.360* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices
*19:06.360- 19:11.380* :  technically violates those onerous to your contracts they said what the **** are you talking about?
*19:11.380- 19:16.800* :  You insane Hollywood ****. So to recap we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month
*19:16.800- 19:21.140* :  to just $15 a month. Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.

*20:04.200- 20:09.140* :  In Mozambique, the smuggling of illegally harvested wood from the country's forest to China
*20:09.140- 20:14.580* :  is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. A report from the environmental
*20:14.580- 20:20.520* :  investigation agency which campaigns against environmental crime and abuse says that the trade
*20:20.520- 20:26.020* :  is out of control and fueling one of the world's least reported conflicts. Alex Bloom is the lead
*20:26.020- 20:32.920* :  author and she spoke to the BBC's Rob Young. For many years we've been looking at the timber sector
*20:32.920- 20:39.300* :  in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique and we've seen massive volumes of illegal timber being exported
*20:39.920- 20:46.260* :  from the country unprocessed in log form. Most of that going to China and unfortunately that is
*20:46.700- 20:51.820* :  in violation of Mozambique's log export ban. In addition to that we found that in the province of
*20:51.820- 20:57.960* :  Cabo Delgado there's a nexus between this illicit timber sector and the trade and the insurgency
*20:57.960- 21:05.080* :  that has been occupying the north of the country. Since 2017 over 500,000 tons of unprocessed wood
*21:05.080- 21:11.660* :  has been imported by China from Mozambique annually. And how much of that is against Mozambique's law?
*21:11.960- 21:17.140* :  Unfortunately all of that is unprocessed and is in violation of Mozambique's log export ban
*21:17.340- 21:22.660* :  and so the entirety of it is in breach of the national log export ban that's been in place since
*21:22.660- 21:28.100* :  2017. Is it possible the authorities don't know about this? This has been reported on four years
*21:28.100- 21:32.760* :  and it's quite likely the authorities are well aware of it. The former environmental minister
*21:32.760- 21:38.980* :  Correa has talked about it quite a lot and has imposed over the years different measures to try
*21:38.980- 21:46.600* :  to contain the scale of the trade. So that is why in 2017 what had previously been a log export ban
*21:46.600- 21:52.160* :  on just a subclass of species was expanded to all native species and there have been crackdowns
*21:52.160- 21:58.340* :  over the year to try to limit the scale of the damage. But unfortunately there's been just very
*21:58.340- 22:04.980* :  unabated volumes continuing in spite of that ban and that's enabled by the conflict and by corruption.
*22:05.320- 22:09.380* :  Right, so it's happening in an area beyond the reach of the central government?
*22:09.780- 22:12.800* :  It is a country with high levels of poverty and in addition,
*22:12.800- 22:18.220* :  Capitol Guard was the northernmost province so it's quite far from the Capitol. It doesn't benefit
*22:18.220- 22:23.780* :  from as many resources and there's a lot of corruption there. So while some officials try to do
*22:23.780- 22:28.720* :  the right thing, there's a lot of other officials who are benefiting as well from some of the corruption
*22:28.720- 22:33.900* :  involved. And you said it's linked to the violence in Capitol Guard. It just explained how that is.
*22:34.540- 22:40.300* :  Yeah, so in our investigation, we had over 30 sources interviewed who are involved in some way
*22:40.300- 22:45.940* :  in the timber sector in Capitol Guard or knowledgeable about that sector. And what they described is
*22:45.940- 22:51.720* :  that the timber traders buy wood from different forests, different origins around the province of
*22:51.720- 22:58.440* :  Capitol Guard, including illegal sources and from insurgency occupied areas, even areas where insurgents
*22:58.440- 23:04.580* :  have cut down wood themselves and are benefiting from the sales and from the profits of that timber
*23:04.580- 23:10.300* :  sector. All that wood is then brought to Montepuêche where most of these traders have their
*23:10.300- 23:15.460* :  sawmill and containerizing processes. And the wood is all mixed together, put in containers,
*23:15.460- 23:21.980* :  and then trucked to Mozambique sports to be shipped and exported most of that to China. So China
*23:21.980- 23:28.280* :  needs to do more to uphold its commitments to illegal deforestation and to its partnership with
*23:28.280- 23:35.120* :  Mozambique. Alex Bloom talking to Rob Young. There's hardly any area of our life now that's not
*23:35.120- 23:40.780* :  influenced by artificial intelligence and the technologies being updated ever more rapidly.
*23:41.300- 23:47.800* :  Now, a new version of chat GPT has been launched. The 4.0 update apparently recognizes different
*23:47.800- 23:54.560* :  languages, reads your emotions, and you can talk to it rather than just communicating by text as they
*23:54.560- 24:00.640* :  demonstrated at the launch on Monday night. Hey chat GPT. Hey there, what's up? How can I brighten
*24:00.640- 24:05.020* :  your day today? Okay, yeah, so I'm going to show you a selfie of what I look like and then I'd like you
*24:05.020- 24:09.860* :  to try to see what emotions I'm feeling based on how I'm looking. Sounds like a fun challenge.
*24:09.900- 24:16.940* :  Go ahead and show me that selfie and I'll put my emotional detective hat on. Okay, so here's me.
*24:17.180- 24:23.640* :  So what kind of emotions do you think I'm feeling? Hmm, it seems like I'm looking at a picture of a
*24:23.640- 24:27.600* :  wooden surface. Oh, you know what? Now what's the thing I sent you before? Don't worry, I'm not
*24:27.600- 24:32.820* :  actually a table. Okay, so take another look. That makes more sense.
*24:35.660- 24:40.320* :  There we go. It looks like you're feeling pretty happy and tearful.
*24:41.040- 24:46.000* :  Well, our tech editor, Zoe Kleinman, was enjoying all that fun at the launch and explained why this
*24:46.000- 24:52.440* :  latest chat GPT version represents a technical step forward. The big thing about it is, I think
*24:52.440- 24:58.560* :  number one, it can recognize text, speech and images and number two, it speaks and there's no
*24:58.560- 25:03.380* :  latency. That means there's no delay between you asking it something or showing it something and it
*25:03.380- 25:09.740* :  responding. It's got this kind of warm, expressive voice sounding like a sort of young American woman.
*25:09.740- 25:14.240* :  It's chatty and as you said, a little bit flirty as well and I think what it shows us that's really
*25:14.240- 25:19.220* :  interesting is where this tech is going. You know, we're very much looking at a massive rival to
*25:19.640- 25:25.540* :  assistance like Siri and Alexa, sorry if I've just set yours off at home there. But you can see it
*25:25.540- 25:31.120* :  becoming a conversational companion and it is a big leap forward, I think, for this kind of
*25:31.120- 25:35.180* :  technology that we've heard so much about and seen so much investment pouring into for so long.
*25:35.380- 25:40.220* :  I think increasingly people are going to struggle to believe that these things aren't sentient
*25:40.220- 25:46.200* :  because they are convincing. At one point, the demonstrator said to this device, you know,
*25:46.200- 25:50.160* :  you're awesome and it replied, I'll stop it, you're making me blush. And it was very quick,
*25:50.160- 25:54.180* :  a very natural conversation. It is important to say, it's not sentient, it is a machine,
*25:54.180- 25:59.300* :  it's complicated bit of programming, it's very sophisticated, but it is not thinking for itself.
*25:59.300- 26:03.020* :  I think increasingly though, that is the idea, you know, Elon Musk has said,
*26:03.020- 26:08.000* :  if these things are successful, they can become like a human companion and help to ease loneliness.
*26:08.340- 26:11.080* :  And I think what we saw last night was that perhaps this is possible.
*26:11.820- 26:17.060* :  So, Eclineman, artificial intelligence is one of those areas which seems to generate hopes and
*26:17.060- 26:23.580* :  fears in equal measure, fears among the general public, but also among those who work in the AI field,
*26:23.580- 26:29.180* :  like Wendy Hall, a professor of computer science and director of the web science institute.
*26:29.820- 26:35.340* :  My worry is that it's more likely to be able to fool people into thinking it's a human being.
*26:36.740- 26:41.360* :  So, what are the safeguards they're building in? What are the guidelines they're giving us for
*26:41.360- 26:45.080* :  using it and how they tested it? That's what they're not telling us.
*26:45.220- 26:50.200* :  What scenarios are you worried about about how it would be used or could be used to fool people?
*26:50.600- 26:55.860* :  Imagine, you know, the scams where you're, it sounds like your daughter or son,
*26:55.860- 27:01.860* :  the rookie, and you're up to ask for money, that sort of impersonation, the fake news that we're
*27:01.860- 27:09.080* :  talking about with elections. It'll be easier to do and it'll be easier to fool people because it'll
*27:09.400- 27:15.040* :  be more human-like. So, we can use it for all sorts of good things, but it will also be applied
*27:15.040- 27:19.780* :  for the bad things. And that's what we're not getting from the companies or the guidelines as
*27:19.780- 27:25.200* :  to how best to use this new technology and how safe is it? How have they tested it?
*27:25.660- 27:31.180* :  Wendy Hall speaking to Michelle Hussain. Good news for the fight to prevent heart attacks and
*27:31.180- 27:36.840* :  strokes. It turns out that a medicine designed to tackle obesity is also effective against those
*27:36.840- 27:42.440* :  other health issues. Semmer Glutide is what it's called technically, but it's sold under the
*27:42.440- 27:48.180* :  brand name's WegaVee or Eusempic. And what's got research so excited is that it seems to reduce
*27:48.180- 27:53.200* :  heart trouble and strokes whether or not the people injected with it actually lose weight.
*27:53.200- 27:58.380* :  The study was conducted by the cardiologist, Professor John Deanfield, who explained the long
*27:58.380- 28:04.960* :  history behind the drugs development. This class of drugs they call GLP1 receptor agonists
*28:04.960- 28:11.900* :  or GLP1RAs were originally introduced as treatments for diabetes, but were shown subsequently to
*28:11.900- 28:18.580* :  produce a significant amount of weight loss. So, this trial that we did recruited more than 17,000
*28:18.580- 28:25.560* :  people and gave them the drug, GoVee or Semmer Glutide over more than four years. And these were
*28:25.560- 28:31.640* :  people who had previous heart disease, but who were living with overweight or obesity, but did not
*28:31.640- 28:37.680* :  have diabetes. And what it showed was that there was about a 20% reduction in their cardiovascular
*28:37.680- 28:44.000* :  events, subsequently, in association with about a 10% loss in their weight. There was a second point
*28:44.000- 28:49.240* :  that was equally interesting, as though we looked at the amount of weight they lost in the trial,
*28:49.240- 28:54.780* :  that was unrelated to the cardiovascular benefit that they got. There is a wide scale opportunity,
*28:54.780- 29:00.680* :  but of course these drugs have to be evaluated in the usual way. Certainly, if you don't take
*29:00.680- 29:06.240* :  these drugs and you continue with your previous lifestyle eating habits and the like, a substantial
*29:06.260- 29:11.320* :  number of people put weight back on, but that's not really very different from what we have with
*29:11.320- 29:15.920* :  other drugs like statins for lowering cholesterol, or indeed blood pressure lowering medications.
*29:16.580- 29:21.040* :  If you have high blood pressure, you need to take your medicines for life to reduce that blood
*29:21.060- 29:24.480* :  pressure to get the benefit. And it may be the same with these drugs.
*29:25.740- 29:31.080* :  John Deanfield. Now, I've had a chance to look at a couple of websites today, which offer advice
*29:31.080- 29:37.260* :  on what to do if you're attacked by a crocodile. In case you're wondering, the perhaps rather obvious
*29:37.260- 29:42.900* :  suggestion is that you should run away. Then, however, it was not the reaction of Georgia Laurie,
*29:42.900- 29:48.060* :  the 31-year-old from Southern England was on holiday in Mexico with her twin sister Melissa
*29:48.060- 29:54.060* :  three years ago when a crocodile tried to drag Melissa underwater. Instead of fleeing,
*29:54.060- 29:58.920* :  Georgia punched the crocodile repeatedly in the face, saving her sister's life.
*29:59.320- 30:04.340* :  And today, she received the King's gallantry medal. The sisters told their story to the BBC's
*30:04.340- 30:08.560* :  Laura Maxwell. Honestly, it feels like it was yesterday. It's gone so quickly,
*30:09.920- 30:14.860* :  but the whole experience was just terrifying. You know, you don't really know how you're going to
*30:14.860- 30:22.240* :  react until you're in that situation. But, you know, how do you fight for crocodile? It was terrifying,
*30:22.240- 30:28.480* :  you know. The first thing we saw was its swim towards us. And so we tried to get ways
*30:28.480- 30:35.840* :  quickly as possible. And unfortunately, Melissa was snatched underwater. And I couldn't hear any
*30:37.000- 30:41.600* :  any response from her when I was calling out for her name. And so that's when I decided to go
*30:41.600- 30:46.820* :  back and find her and I saw her body floating towards me in the mangroves. And unfortunately,
*30:46.820- 30:51.360* :  the crocodile came back at that point and it grabbed her by the ankle and it dragged her away from me
*30:51.400- 30:57.260* :  so I was punching it off her and trying to keep her head above above water at the same time. And
*30:57.260- 31:03.220* :  thankfully, it swam away again. And I managed to drag her away a little bit somewhere more secluded.
*31:04.200- 31:13.160* :  But it came back a third time, unfortunately. So, yeah, the fight carried on another time and
*31:13.180- 31:19.420* :  eventually got around to the boat. And yeah, it was it was a long and arduous ordeal.
*31:20.180- 31:22.900* :  Do you know how long it lasted for? It must have felt like it went on forever.
*31:23.400- 31:30.520* :  It did. It felt like it went on forever, but perhaps it was only five minutes, but you know,
*31:30.520- 31:36.560* :  time kind of stands still in that situation. And everything around you kind of switches off.
*31:37.280- 31:42.560* :  It was like my senses were heightened, but everything was in focus in front of me. It was just me
*31:42.560- 31:46.720* :  in my fight with the crocodile. Melissa, do you remember anything about this?
*31:47.640- 31:55.660* :  I only remember the first attack where the crocodile bit my hand and dragged me underwater.
*31:56.820- 32:01.520* :  And I don't remember much until sort of waking up. I think before the second attack,
*32:01.520- 32:08.860* :  I started flailing my arms about. I must have been in a fit or something. And then it took me away.
*32:09.920- 32:16.520* :  And then the third time, it actually defrauded me. And thankfully, I don't remember that happening
*32:16.520- 32:22.600* :  at all until waking up onto the boat. You know, I was very delirious.
*32:23.240- 32:26.960* :  I'm just struggling to know how both of you must feel looking back on this because it does
*32:26.980- 32:31.680* :  sound like such a horrific thing. Have you recovered, George, as well? Because despite the fact that
*32:31.680- 32:36.300* :  it was Melissa that went through it, you watched it and we're such a huge part of it.
*32:36.580- 32:40.440* :  You know, I feel like these things definitely do make you stronger, emotionally,
*32:41.540- 32:46.060* :  certainly in the sense that it enables you to connect with people. And I think that's a really
*32:46.060- 32:53.620* :  lovely thing. But it does, you know, it's certainly something that is a journey that it just takes time.
