*01:24.360- 01:29.340* :  I'm Janet Gillian at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 17th of May. These are our main stories.
*01:29.960- 01:35.260* :  Israel tells the UN's highest court that accusations of genocide are a distortion of facts
*01:35.260- 01:39.660* :  as it defends its military campaign in Gaza. When dealing with the law,
*01:40.660- 01:48.100* :  facts matter. Calling something a genocide again and again does not make it genocide.
*01:49.200- 01:53.400* :  AIDS starts arriving in Gaza from a temporary peer constructed by the US military.
*01:53.860- 01:58.460* :  For the UN says it's not enough for the dire humanitarian situation there and calls for land
*01:58.460- 02:06.620* :  crossings to be reopened. The stocks of food inside Gaza are virtually consumed and it's virtually
*02:06.620- 02:10.860* :  impossible to plan an aid operation where you don't know where the war is going next.
*02:13.080- 02:18.060* :  Also in this podcast scientists believe they've solved the mystery of how dozens of pyramids were
*02:18.060- 02:28.040* :  built in Egypt. We start in the hake where Israel has defended its military operations in Gaza
*02:28.040- 02:33.520* :  at the United Nations highest court. Israel was responding to South Africa's call for the
*02:33.520- 02:39.420* :  international court of justice to order a stop to Israeli military action in the city of Raffa
*02:39.580- 02:45.540* :  where many displaced Palestinians had sought shelter and across Gaza. South Africa has also accused
*02:45.540- 02:52.480* :  Israel of genocide in the Gaza war. Lawyer Gillian Nome told the court that South Africa was presenting
*02:52.480- 03:00.880* :  biased and false claims. South Africa presents the court yet again with a picture that is completely
*03:00.880- 03:09.020* :  divorced from the facts and circumstances. It makes a mockery of the heinous charge of genocide.
*03:09.540- 03:17.960* :  As Israel has previously stated before this court, when dealing with the law, facts matter. Truth
*03:18.960- 03:25.700* :  should matter. Words must retain their meaning. Calling something a genocide again and again
*03:26.500- 03:32.960* :  does not make it genocide. Fighting has been raging around Raffa following an Israeli operation
*03:32.960- 03:40.200* :  which began around 10 days ago. Israel says it's vital if it is to eradicate Hamas. The UN says the
*03:40.200- 03:47.660* :  past week has seen at least 600,000 people fleeing Raffa in a vain search for safety. Mr Nome
*03:47.660- 03:53.080* :  insisted that Israel had acted in accordance with international law and its humanitarian obligations.
*03:53.840- 03:58.480* :  A correspondent Anna Holigan is at the court in the Hague where she told us more about Israel's
*03:58.480- 04:04.320* :  robust response. Israel describes South Africa's case as an inversion of reality divorced from the
*04:04.360- 04:10.380* :  facts. Israel's lawyers accused South Africa of exploiting the genocide convention and presenting
*04:10.460- 04:17.420* :  outlandish allegations. The most repugnant among them, the lawyers said, were claims that Israel had
*04:17.420- 04:23.240* :  created zones of extermination. So using language reminiscent of the Holocaust, making efforts to
*04:23.240- 04:28.780* :  link the situation in Raffa today with the genocide in Srebrenica. The hearing is over. We just
*04:28.780- 04:34.100* :  heard from South Africa some of the South African delegation on the steps of the Peace Palace
*04:34.100- 04:39.580* :  into the international court of justice. Israel won't be making a statement today but South Africa's
*04:39.580- 04:45.980* :  team said that what we're witnessing is a live stream of genocide in Gaza and Israel is asking us
*04:45.980- 04:52.180* :  not to see what we have seen with our own eyes. So really strong language from both sides today.
*04:52.540- 04:58.560* :  And when are we expecting an ICJ ruling on this? The ICJ is dealing with this as a matter of
*04:58.560- 05:05.980* :  urgency. Usually rulings in provisional measures cases take one or two weeks so we would expect
*05:05.980- 05:11.320* :  something relatively soon and just to remind you what South Africa has asked for here. South Africa
*05:11.320- 05:17.460* :  wants the judges to urgently order Israel to, first of all, withdraw from Raffa to call the cease
*05:17.500- 05:24.220* :  far secondly to ensure adequate humanitarian aid access access for UN investigators access
*05:24.220- 05:29.220* :  for journalists who have any violations of the genocide convention are being committed. The
*05:29.220- 05:35.920* :  evidence can be gathered and preserved. Israel said there is no violation taking place and if the
*05:35.920- 05:42.340* :  judges were to rule in this case in South Africa's favor then Israel said this court would be denying
*05:42.700- 05:49.060* :  Israel's right to defend itself and also would be empowering Hamas to continue to commit the crimes.
*05:50.340- 05:56.160* :  Anna Holligan in the hage. In Gaza itself a temporary peer built by American troops has been used
*05:56.160- 06:01.220* :  for the first time to deliver humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. A correspondent in
*06:01.220- 06:07.080* :  Jerusalem Dan Johnson says with food and medicines in short supply across Gaza as land crossings
*06:07.080- 06:15.720* :  remain closed this new aid route is a welcome development. It enables larger ships to dock with aid
*06:15.720- 06:21.620* :  consignments that are being shipped from Cyprus and they are then ferried to the shore so this is
*06:21.620- 06:28.680* :  another route for aid to reach the Hungry Palestinian refugees of Gaza but the emphasis by the U.S
*06:28.680- 06:34.260* :  the UN and others involved in this operation is that this is a temporary measure that it is
*06:34.260- 06:40.300* :  additional that it does not replace the aid flows that should be continuing through Gaza's land
*06:40.300- 06:45.540* :  borders and that has been a serious issue over the last week particularly with the RAFA crossing
*06:45.540- 06:52.200* :  with Egypt having been closed after Israel's military moved in on the Gaza side of that border
*06:52.200- 06:57.520* :  crossing that was somewhere that was key to the delivery of aid for the Palestinians even before
*06:57.520- 07:01.940* :  the current conflict and the emphasis is that even though this is a positive step that will
*07:01.940- 07:08.460* :  enable some aid shipments to dock and directly deliver to Gaza's shores that the land borders
*07:08.460- 07:15.680* :  the land routes need to be reestablished secured and maintained so that proper aid enough food
*07:15.680- 07:21.360* :  enough fuel shelter and medical supplies can be brought in for the hundreds of thousands of
*07:21.360- 07:26.760* :  Palestinian refugees particularly those from RAFA itself who have been on the move again in the
*07:26.760- 07:32.140* :  last week or so with the intensifying military operations around RAFA around that city
*07:33.320- 07:38.620* :  well the UN says the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire and has called again for those
*07:38.620- 07:44.280* :  land crossings to be opened immediately to bring in aid here's a UN humanitarian aid chief Martin
*07:44.280- 07:52.560* :  Griffiths the stocks of food inside Gaza are virtually consumed the dangers of movement
*07:52.560- 07:58.460* :  are very clear for the people of RAFA and for the humanitarian workers involved in Gaza in
*07:58.460- 08:04.300* :  responding to their needs this is what we feared and it's virtually impossible to plan an aid
*08:04.300- 08:07.780* :  operation where you don't know if there's going to be fuel where you don't know where the war is
*08:07.820- 08:12.480* :  going next and where you don't know how many more people are going to move and where to
*08:13.640- 08:19.000* :  the UN's Martin Griffiths China has announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to try to
*08:19.000- 08:24.620* :  shore up its crisis hit property market it will allow local governments to buy up empty homes from
*08:24.620- 08:30.260* :  developers to convert them into affordable housing and it's also easing mortgage rules China's
*08:30.260- 08:35.440* :  property sector accounts for about a fifth of the economy with millions of jobs dependent on it
*08:35.820- 08:40.180* :  and it's slumped in the past few years after the authorities crack down on developers high
*08:40.180- 08:46.000* :  reliance on debt for growth our business reporter Nick Marsh told us more about China's property
*08:46.000- 08:51.860* :  crisis well it has its roots in the huge property boom at the beginning of this century which kind of
*08:51.860- 08:56.660* :  went in tandem with China's more general economic boom and without going into too much of a history
*08:56.660- 09:02.500* :  lesson basically property developers saw that there was huge money to be made in building building
*09:02.500- 09:08.080* :  building Chinese middle class want to put their money into property as an investment that's
*09:08.080- 09:14.200* :  generally what they tend to do and to put it very simply developers borrowed too much money to
*09:14.200- 09:20.600* :  build too many houses that not enough people want to buy in the consequence is a huge oversupply
*09:20.600- 09:26.260* :  of housing right now and you've got this phenomenon of like ghost cities you know huge massive
*09:26.260- 09:32.020* :  gleaming structures of thousands of apartments with barely anyone living in there and you can imagine
*09:32.020- 09:37.100* :  what that does to house prices it sends them crashing down and like you said if a fifth of the
*09:37.100- 09:42.400* :  economy was even it was more actually a few years ago is housing and property property prices are
*09:42.400- 09:46.700* :  going down that's really going to hurt the Chinese economy it's going to hurt ordinary people as well
*09:46.880- 09:52.020* :  yeah and if it hurts the Chinese economy it may have knock on effects on other world economies just
*09:52.020- 09:57.880* :  so just tell us about these latest measures to try to deal with this crisis which has been going on
*09:57.880- 10:02.140* :  for some years now it's been going on for some years and the Chinese government's been in a bit of
*10:02.140- 10:07.120* :  a dilemma as to how to deal with it because on the one hand you don't want to be seen to bail out
*10:07.120- 10:11.300* :  these property companies like Evergrande country guard and these are names you might have heard of
*10:11.660- 10:15.780* :  because if you do that well that basically isn't punishing them for overextending themselves
*10:15.780- 10:22.160* :  and speculating too much but you can't carry on with this situation of empty apartments so they've
*10:22.480- 10:26.780* :  tried to do really the only thing they can do and that's to encourage local governments
*10:26.860- 10:32.800* :  to buy up these empty apartments we don't know how many we don't know when it's going to happen
*10:33.260- 10:37.600* :  but the idea is if the local governments which read local government that's the state government
*10:37.600- 10:42.280* :  you know they do what they're told more or less if they start buying up these these flats and
*10:42.280- 10:47.260* :  they convert them into affordable housing things like that then that oversupply is going to start
*10:47.260- 10:54.440* :  to decrease a little bit it's a really long term structural issue gen out and it's starting
*10:54.440- 10:59.940* :  with these measures don't forget China's a managed economy so they can move money around
*10:59.980- 11:05.360* :  if and when they deem necessary but this is going to take a long long time to fix
*11:06.140- 11:10.760* :  so it sounds like we don't have the full details yet but it could be quite controversial some
*11:10.760- 11:16.460* :  people could see this as a bailout and there is a potential for social unrest here it is a bailout
*11:16.460- 11:23.020* :  I suppose because it's local governments basically spending public money in the end to buy
*11:23.020- 11:29.140* :  these apartments but I think there'd be much more social unrest if the current situation was
*11:29.140- 11:33.880* :  allowed to continue which is basically a situation where people have put hundreds of thousands of
*11:33.880- 11:38.560* :  the equivalent of dollars in their money of their money into apartments that don't even exist
*11:38.560- 11:43.480* :  that haven't even been built yet so I think people in China want to see their apartments be built
*11:44.020- 11:48.540* :  and be able to actually see something through their investment and see the government actually
*11:48.540- 11:53.420* :  taking action in some way I think that's what the priority is so I think it's trying to avoid
*11:53.420- 11:58.420* :  more social unrest or discontent really is probably a more accurate word that is kind of
*11:58.420- 12:00.540* :  motivating the Chinese government to take these measures
*12:01.360- 12:06.920* :  Nick Marsh saying with China Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have vowed to work together against
*12:06.920- 12:13.180* :  what they say is destructive and hostile US pressure and to deepen the ties that have sustained
*12:13.180- 12:18.700* :  Russia's invasion of Ukraine Mr Putin has been given a lavish welcome during a two day state
*12:18.700- 12:24.880* :  visit to China many fear that China might try to take Taiwan by force but in an interview with
*12:24.880- 12:29.300* :  the BBC Taiwan's president says she doesn't believe an attack from China is imminent
*12:29.340- 12:35.900* :  si in ruin says Taiwan is militarily much stronger today than it was when she came to power eight
*12:35.900- 12:42.040* :  years ago and the cost to China of invading the island would be huge the Taiwanese president spoke
*12:42.040- 12:47.320* :  about her record in an exclusive interview with our Asia correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes
*12:47.660- 12:54.060* :  this isn't something you're going to see in the halls of power in Beijing
*12:55.420- 13:01.240* :  this is the sound of Taiwan's most famous drag act performing in front of Taiwan's president
*13:01.240- 13:06.760* :  Tai Ing-wen inside the grand entrance lobby of the presidential building in Taipei
*13:09.160- 13:14.480* :  it was one of the final events president Si hosted before she's due to step down next Monday
*13:17.920- 13:23.600* :  to the casual observer president Si Ing-wen doesn't look like a revolutionary she's a softly
*13:23.600- 13:30.960* :  spoken former law professor sometimes described as Asia's Angela Merkel but Taiwan's first female
*13:30.960- 13:37.680* :  president has quietly transformed this place into arguably the most progressive society in this
*13:37.680- 13:45.100* :  region for example Taipei now hosts the largest gay pride festival in Asia and in 2019 against
*13:45.100- 13:50.620* :  fierce opposition president Si's government pushed through legislation making Taiwan the first
*13:50.620- 14:00.520* :  place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage as she prepares to step down after eight years
*14:00.620- 14:07.280* :  I sat down with president Si at her home in Taipei and asked her why she chose this particular fight
*14:07.860- 14:12.260* :  you were well ahead of any other country in Asia in pushing through that legislation
*14:12.300- 14:18.300* :  why was that such an important priority for it's a test to the society here to see to what extent
*14:18.300- 14:27.440* :  they can move forwards with their values it was very difficult journey I am actually rather proud
*14:27.440- 14:36.840* :  that we managed to overcome our differences the other huge test that has hung over her presidency
*14:36.940- 14:42.220* :  is dealing with the growing military threat from China president Xi Jinping's meeting
*14:42.220- 14:49.060* :  with Vladimir Putin in Beijing this week is a reminder of the scale of forces arrayed against Taiwan
*14:53.680- 14:58.080* :  I recently accompanied president Si as she opened a new special forces training base
*14:58.660- 15:00.060* :  on the outskirts of Taipei
*15:03.340- 15:06.900* :  so I guess for president Si this is a sort of demonstration of what she's been trying to
*15:06.900- 15:11.480* :  achieve in defense policy over the last eight years because part of her big thing is that
*15:11.480- 15:15.420* :  Taiwan doesn't spend enough on defense when she came in it was about two percent of GDP she's
*15:15.420- 15:19.800* :  managed to push that out to about two and a half percent of GDP a lot of people say Taiwan needs to
*15:19.800- 15:25.540* :  be spending north of three percent of its GDP to have an effective military given the huge threat
*15:25.540- 15:31.600* :  that it faces from China what your critics would say is Taiwan cannot hope by itself to deter China
*15:31.600- 15:39.460* :  militarily the cost of taking over Taiwan is going to be enormous Chinese leadership have to make
*15:39.460- 15:46.900* :  a good calculation as to whether they're prepared to pay the cost what we need to do is to increase
*15:46.900- 15:53.220* :  the cost of an invasion today Taiwan produces most of the world's really cutting edge computer chips
*15:53.560- 15:57.960* :  an attack on the island would arguably be far more damaging to the world's economy than Russia's
*15:57.960- 16:03.480* :  invasion of Ukraine president Si thinks the democratic world should care about Taiwan for a different
*16:03.480- 16:07.120* :  reason because it is a remarkable beacon of freedom and democracy
*16:07.360- 16:12.860* :  China of course will say that we're part of them it's for the people to interpret what
*16:13.420- 16:19.100* :  Taiwan represents the most important thing is that we are on our own and we are a democracy
*16:20.680- 16:26.840* :  that was a Taiwanese president Si Ing-Woon talking to Rupert Wingfield Hayes and you can watch
*16:26.840- 16:32.000* :  the full conversation on the interview on the BBC news channel
*16:34.320- 16:38.840* :  for thousands of years it's been one of the world's great mysteries just how were the pyramids in
*16:38.840- 16:43.860* :  Egypt built now scientists say they think they've solved the mystery of how dozens of pyramids
*16:43.860- 16:49.680* :  including the world famous Giza complex were constructed they've discovered a long-lost and
*16:49.680- 16:55.620* :  ancient branch of the river Nile which is now hidden under desert and farmland using surveys,
*16:55.620- 17:01.840* :  satellite imagery, alt maps and sediment samples they say the waterway would have been used to
*17:01.840- 17:08.860* :  float stone blocks Suzanne Onstein is an associate professor at the University of Memphis and co-wrote
*17:08.860- 17:15.640* :  the study we have evidence that they use the river as transport for large things like obelisks
*17:15.920- 17:24.560* :  they dragged huge stones and statues on that kind of log log log system and getting all of that
*17:24.560- 17:31.220* :  heavy stuff as close as possible to the building site and that includes not just stones but massive
*17:31.220- 17:39.220* :  amounts of food to support the population grain and meats and vegetables from all over for the
*17:39.220- 17:44.420* :  work crews so there's a lot of stuff other than just the heavy building stones that those harbors
*17:44.420- 17:50.400* :  and access to the river would have been important for so what are the big unanswered questions about
*17:50.400- 17:56.840* :  the pyramids that archaeologists are still trying to find out we have all of these sort of little
*17:56.860- 18:03.580* :  pieces of evidence that we can string together to speak about the building of the pyramids that
*18:03.980- 18:09.620* :  some of the stone was quarried nearby that some of it was being delivered from the red sea that some
*18:09.620- 18:15.800* :  of it's quarried for their south but there's no smoking gun instruction manual that says first you
*18:15.800- 18:20.560* :  drag a stone here and then you build a ramp and then you drag it up the ramp and put it on top
*18:20.560- 18:26.440* :  there are pyramids with different construction styles in this whole stretch of pyramids so we
*18:26.440- 18:33.540* :  can't really say that there's only one way that this happened. Susan Onstein, associate professor
*18:33.540- 18:41.760* :  at the University of Memphis speaking to Alex Ritson. Weeping statues, healing relics and divine
*18:41.760- 18:47.120* :  apparitions some have been recognised by the Vatican to be credible and in fact miraculous
*18:47.820- 18:53.860* :  while others have been judged by church officials to be superstitious mumbo jumbo. These are themes
*18:53.860- 18:58.960* :  addressed in the Vatican's new guidelines on what it calls supernatural phenomena which are being
*18:58.960- 19:06.080* :  published today. Stephen Yehichnik reports. The town of lords nestles in a valley at the foot of the
*19:06.200- 19:15.080* :  pillage. The Virgin Mary at lords and Fatima. Hugely important places of pilgrimage for the Catholic
*19:15.080- 19:22.320* :  church. There are sites like this dotted all over the world where Catholics believe supernatural
*19:22.320- 19:30.020* :  phenomena like apparitions of Mary the mother of Jesus have taken place but for every pilgrimage site
*19:30.020- 19:38.720* :  there are dozens of other sightings apparitions weeping statues and healing relics that how does the
*19:38.720- 19:44.580* :  Catholic church decide which apparitions or supernatural goings on are considered legitimate.
*19:47.900- 19:54.180* :  While there is no department for the supernatural in Rome nearly 50 years ago authorities there
*19:54.180- 19:59.500* :  drew up a set of guidelines for bishops who were given the responsibility of deciding this.
*20:01.180- 20:09.120* :  Known as norms they were written in Latin and only translated in 2011 on the orders of Pope Benedict
*20:09.120- 20:16.280* :  XVI supposedly after an increase in the number of reported apparitions and to avoid wider confusion.
*20:19.440- 20:26.340* :  More than a decade on Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez who leads the Vatican department responsible
*20:26.380- 20:34.060* :  for religious discipline has been charged with updating these guidelines. While the Catholic church
*20:34.060- 20:39.740* :  has been coy so far about what exactly will change it's thought the rise of social media
*20:40.400- 20:44.360* :  and an increase in the potential for stories to go viral is part of the move.
*21:05.980- 21:11.140* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The political crisis in Georgia came to a head this
*21:11.140- 21:16.560* :  week when the country's parliament finally voted through a highly controversial foreign agent
*21:16.560- 21:22.500* :  law that sparked weeks of mass protests. Under the bill non-governmental organizations and
*21:22.500- 21:28.380* :  independent media that receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign donors will have to
*21:28.380- 21:35.480* :  register as organizations bearing the interests of a foreign power. It's been nicknamed the Russian
*21:35.480- 21:41.140* :  law by opponents who say has a lot in common with a similar bill that came into force in Russia
*21:41.140- 21:46.900* :  just over a decade ago and which has been used by the Kremlin since then to silence dissent.
*21:47.420- 21:52.080* :  One of the leading opponents of the bill is Georgia's president Salami Zura Bichvili who can
*21:52.080- 21:57.040* :  vise over the bill although she can't ultimately overrule parliament. My colleague Victoria
*21:57.040- 22:02.860* :  Gromkunda asked her how critical a moment this is for Georgia. Well it's critical and that's why
*22:02.860- 22:09.800* :  there are so many people under the streets for now. 37 days exactly and with sometimes more than
*22:09.800- 22:17.800* :  200,000 people it's very critical because we are at very close to the door of the European Union.
*22:17.800- 22:24.880* :  We have received the status of candidate. We are moving down that path and we have the chance or
*22:24.880- 22:32.000* :  the opportunity to reach by the end of the year hopefully the opening of negotiations of accession.
*22:32.660- 22:38.820* :  And exactly at this time when we should be working the parliament should be working actively
*22:39.560- 22:47.020* :  on the reforms that are still needed to be delivered in order to get this possibility. At this
*22:47.020- 22:53.240* :  time instead of doing that and we have an agenda of reforms that is still long we are discussing
*22:54.040- 22:58.940* :  a law that was rejected last year that there was a promise of the authorities never to
*22:59.660- 23:05.580* :  represent it. There is no argumentation of why it has been represented except that it provokes
*23:06.300- 23:13.160* :  polarization and it's a form of provocation to a country that is waiting to progress on the
*23:13.520- 23:20.020* :  past towards Europe to present a law that is clearly understood by all our partners and by the
*23:20.020- 23:26.580* :  society as an obstacle to Europe. Madame President you have said that you will veto the bill however
*23:27.340- 23:32.620* :  your position as president is more of a ceremonial role with the prime minister as the head of
*23:32.620- 23:38.900* :  government because Georgia is a parliamentary democracy and the ruling party has a majority in
*23:38.900- 23:45.140* :  parliament. Is this a risk of back and forth with this bill? Why are you getting involved?
*23:46.140- 23:52.160* :  I'm getting involved because I'm without executive power for the legislative powers that's clear
*23:52.160- 23:59.640* :  but I've been elected by the population so I'm answerable to them and their voice today which I'm
*23:59.640- 24:07.440* :  hearing is that they do not want to risk with this bill to lose their European chance. So they know
*24:07.440- 24:14.260* :  and I know that my veto is going to be overpassed because they have a majority but that doesn't matter
*24:14.260- 24:21.100* :  sometimes politics is about symbols and it's about expressing clearly a position and that's what
*24:21.100- 24:26.240* :  I'm going to do. I'm siding with the part of the population and that's a very vast majority
*24:27.020- 24:33.780* :  that for years now has been saying that it wants a European future and that is the declaration
*24:33.780- 24:42.040* :  and the way the statement that I'm making with the veto and then we'll go back to the next stage
*24:42.040- 24:48.360* :  which are the elections in October and that's where really the future of the country will be decided
*24:48.360- 24:55.860* :  because we have to in fact abolish not only this low but a number of other lows that are not
*24:55.860- 25:03.800* :  less entire European in essence and its substance and that can be done only through elections when
*25:03.800- 25:10.680* :  the Georgian population will clearly say what future it wants that it wants Europe which I do not
*25:11.180- 25:18.940* :  doubt and then we can pick up on our European past where it was left and remove those artificial
*25:18.940- 25:26.820* :  obstacles that were set by this all range of lows that are not going according to the values
*25:26.820- 25:32.720* :  of Europe or to the objectives of Europe. You said earlier when we were speaking that Georgia
*25:32.720- 25:39.580* :  is very close to the door of the EU and foreign ministers from across Europe were just in Georgia
*25:39.580- 25:45.980* :  and they met with you in Solidarity, the Lithuanian foreign minister said and I'm quoting what he
*25:45.980- 25:52.500* :  said this is a battle for democracy freedom and European future. Is that how you see these two?
*25:52.780- 25:59.140* :  Yes that's what I'm saying that we are at a critical moment a moment that I'm sure will be
*25:59.140- 26:06.900* :  overcome but it will be overcome peacefully through the elections when clearly the Georgian people
*26:06.900- 26:13.680* :  will say what future they want for the country and I've no doubt about what they want because it's
*26:13.680- 26:21.320* :  what Georgia has wanted since they as never maybe the Georgian population knows that independence
*26:21.320- 26:28.720* :  of this country is linked to its European future there is no other future without Europe and without
*26:28.720- 26:36.040* :  independence. Is Georgia stories the same as Ukraine as an attempt to break away from Russian influence?
*26:36.860- 26:44.000* :  No we have broken away from Russian influence a very long time ago. They do still have 20% of
*26:44.000- 26:50.540* :  your territory that they occupy. Certainly but what is interesting and what should be noted is that
*26:50.540- 26:57.480* :  the fact that we had a war and not only one we had won in 91 and another one in 2008,
*26:58.200- 27:05.180* :  Georgia has not changed its past towards Europe despite 20% of the occupied territory
*27:05.740- 27:13.100* :  it has not neutralized Georgia and Georgia is determined to continue on this path which is not
*27:13.100- 27:20.720* :  a confrontational path with Russia but it is a very determined path to have and bring our own
*27:20.720- 27:26.920* :  future in our hands. Well that was Georgia's president Salami Zura Bichvili speaking to Victoria
*27:26.920- 27:33.080* :  Oonkunda. Nearly a week on from the deadly flash flooding in Northeastern Afghanistan more
*27:33.080- 27:39.260* :  information is emerging of what happened in the remote villages where the water hit. Among them
*27:39.260- 27:45.220* :  are stories of rescues. Our correspondent Caroline Davies and her team have visited the area of Birka
*27:45.220- 27:51.440* :  where they spoke to two families who told them of the incredible moment a 10-year-old girl was pulled
*27:51.440- 27:58.380* :  alive from the flood waters. This is the sound of the raging mud-brown torrent of water
*27:58.800- 28:04.220* :  rushing down the main street of Falul village. The floods came suddenly, violently.
*28:05.120- 28:11.380* :  Nor Ahmad and his family made it onto the roof of their home but then the walls gave way,
*28:11.380- 28:19.960* :  plunging all eight into the thick fast flowing water. When the wall fell I remember thinking I
*28:19.960- 28:28.420* :  have lost everything. We are all finished. I was underwater and was hoping, oh God please take my
*28:28.420- 28:38.000* :  life so my problems will be over. We speak to Nor in a canvas tent pitched where his home used to be.
*28:38.000- 28:43.700* :  He survived by clinging to an armantry but his 10-year-old daughter Zulika had disappeared.
*28:46.700- 28:53.800* :  She was trying to grab onto things but couldn't keep a grip. She said that finally she reached a
*28:53.800- 28:59.340* :  field and floated on her back. Thinking if I stand the flood will take me again.
*29:00.540- 29:04.760* :  Then she heard a voice and my man asking me whose daughter are you?
*29:05.800- 29:11.320* :  Across the street from Nua's house another rescue was taking place. In footage filmed on the
*29:11.320- 29:19.100* :  roof of a mosque children sit huddled, shaking every inch coated in thick sticky mud. They were
*29:19.100- 29:23.520* :  dragged from the flood waters. Habibullah was one of the men to save them.
*29:25.620- 29:30.420* :  I was in the mosque when the flood came through the door. We were all underwater.
*29:31.680- 29:36.300* :  Some men had to get on the roof and with the help of others we knocked through a window.
*29:37.280- 29:41.640* :  I tied the children with a shawl then my friend pulled them up to the roof.
*29:43.400- 29:48.360* :  He shows me them one by one. Some have cuts and bruises on their heads and faces.
*29:49.240- 29:55.620* :  In total we count eight the youngest just three months old that were saved. Meanwhile,
*29:55.620- 30:02.720* :  downstream someone had spotted Zulika. Stuck in the branches of an uprooted tree, 18-year-old
*30:02.720- 30:09.600* :  Alamuddin waited in to help. My father and mother said, don't go there. You will be
*30:09.600- 30:16.400* :  taken by the flood. But my heart filled for her. There was a feeling I had in myself that
*30:16.400- 30:25.900* :  I can do it. He points to his chest. The water came up to here. I took her on my back and I got
*30:25.900- 30:34.960* :  here to our house. Most parts of her body were injured. This is the sound from a video
*30:35.240- 30:42.540* :  taken of Zulika after she was rescued. Shaken, muddied, but her life. She's now recovering at
*30:42.540- 30:47.820* :  her relatives. Her father, Naur, had never met the family that saved his daughter's life.
*30:48.240- 30:51.720* :  When they arrive at his tent, he starts to cry as he thanks them.
*30:55.100- 31:01.720* :  Right now I don't have anything. If I give you the whole world, it won't be equal with what you
*31:01.720- 31:09.360* :  did for us. These are stories from one corner of one village about those who did what they could
*31:09.360- 31:19.260* :  to save others and the waters. Caroline Davis with that story of a remarkable rescue in Afghanistan.
*31:20.320- 31:25.100* :  To France now, where police have shot dead a man who set a synagogue on fire in the north
*31:25.100- 31:30.300* :  western city of Roul, the French interior minister, Jérard Daminin, praised the police for what he
*31:30.300- 31:34.440* :  said was a fast reaction and courage. He's got filled reports from Paris.
*31:59.820- 32:04.500* :  France has seen a rise in anti-Semitic incidents since the start of the war in Gaza.
*32:06.660- 32:13.260* :  Australia's richest person is not happy. Gina Reinhart and Ares and Mining Magnate
*32:13.520- 32:19.620* :  may possess the fortune reportedly worth more than 30 billion dollars, but she's upset by
*32:19.620- 32:24.860* :  a painting at the National Gallery of Australia. It's a rather unflattering portrait of her,
*32:24.860- 32:30.460* :  showing her with wonky eyes and a huge double chin. As Mahibir's though, Ares, a pacific
*32:30.460- 32:35.480* :  editor, told me. It's pretty unflattering this picture, as you mentioned just there. She's
*32:35.480- 32:43.140* :  looking very jowly, wide eyed, pink, flush skin, really, really a poor depiction of Gina Reinhart.
*32:43.140- 32:49.440* :  In defense of the artist, this picture is one of a number, series of portraits of people who
*32:49.440- 32:56.120* :  have shaped Australia in their old caricatures. So it fits in this series. I have to say though,
*32:56.120- 33:01.580* :  Gina Reinhart's picture is slightly worse than most of the others. So tell us more about her.
*33:02.280- 33:07.040* :  Gina Reinhart, she's the richest person in Australia. She inherited a mining company
*33:07.600- 33:12.300* :  from her father, but turned that around and has really increased its wealth. She's also in
*33:12.300- 33:19.000* :  agriculture, moved into media. She's also a really larger than life figure. She's outspoken on
*33:19.000- 33:24.940* :  a number of political issues about too much taxation. She's also supported climate change deniers
*33:25.460- 33:30.920* :  in the past. She's even had arguments which have gone to the court with her own family. We have
*33:30.920- 33:35.660* :  her four children, her mother-in-law, just to name a few people. She's been in court with. So
*33:36.140- 33:41.900* :  really, she's an outspoken figure. So it's not necessarily unexpected to see her being angry
*33:41.900- 33:47.600* :  about this particular painting. And how have other people been reacting to the painting end
*33:47.600- 33:53.300* :  to this controversy? Yes, it's interesting this year actually, how it's played out because she's
*33:53.300- 33:58.760* :  a major philanthropist and so she's put millions and millions, particularly into sporting Australia.
*33:59.240- 34:04.500* :  So a lot of key swimmers in the country and lots of swimming organisations have actually supported
*34:05.100- 34:10.380* :  her dislike of this picture and have asked actually the gallery itself if they would take it down
*34:10.940- 34:15.060* :  inevitably, though, you've got lots of people on the other side of the argument who think,
*34:15.060- 34:20.400* :  look, this is artistic expression. People should be allowed to paint what they want. And it's a
*34:20.400- 34:26.480* :  dangerous precedent just to take down a picture because some particular person doesn't like it.
*34:26.860- 34:34.460* :  Interestingly, the artist himself, Nama Jouison, Aboriginal artist, he said he's painted this series
*34:34.460- 34:42.600* :  of pictures to make people think about influence and privilege. He says he just paints the world
*34:42.600- 34:47.280* :  exactly as he sees it. So that's the last word really from here. Well, I'm paradoxically
*34:47.280- 34:52.220* :  Gina Ryan Hart's complaints probably mean many more people are going to see this portrait
*34:52.220- 34:56.060* :  than would have done otherwise. Exactly. It's the old Joule problem, isn't it? When you complain
*34:56.060- 35:00.080* :  about something nobody sees it, you make the complain everybody in the world sees it.
*35:00.480- 35:05.440* :  Mickey Bristow and you can see the portrait as well as the others in the exhibition on the BBC
*35:05.440- 35:12.340* :  News website. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News
