*01:20.240- 01:26.940* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Gilliland at 13 hours GMT
*01:26.940- 01:30.060* :  on Thursday the 16th of May. These are our main stories.
*01:35.700- 01:41.820* :  President Putin is in China to meet President Xi. It's all smiles, handshakes and warm words.
*01:42.700- 01:47.700* :  The President of Slovakia has called for calm after an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister.
*01:48.100- 01:53.540* :  Let's step out of the vicious circle and neutral place. What happened yesterday was individual act
*01:53.840- 01:56.620* :  but the chance of mass media opinion was uncollected for.
*01:59.580- 02:06.580* :  Also in this podcast could there be a red card for VAR, the controversial video assistant referee?
*02:11.380- 02:16.840* :  China and Russia have put on a display of unity and mutual support during a meeting of their
*02:16.840- 02:23.180* :  two leaders in Beijing at the start of a two-day visit by Vladimir Putin. Xi Jinping and Mr. Putin
*02:23.180- 02:27.880* :  signed a statement that promised to deepen their relationship. Since the invasion of Ukraine,
*02:27.880- 02:34.340* :  Beijing's support has become increasingly important for Moscow. The US had urged China to stop
*02:34.340- 02:39.680* :  showing up the Russian economy by buying its oil and gas, but so far there's little sign that
*02:39.680- 02:45.380* :  Mr. Xi is heating these warnings. As well as holding talks, the two leaders will take part in an
*02:45.380- 02:51.240* :  event to celebrate 75 years since the Soviet Union recognized the people's Republic of China.
*02:51.780- 02:54.560* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicker reports from Beijing.
*02:57.460- 03:04.220* :  Mr. Putin walked the red carpet to a red army song welcome. Thousands of miles away his troops
*03:04.220- 03:10.760* :  are opening up a new front in Ukraine. Their success on that battlefield may depend on how
*03:10.760- 03:13.700* :  persuasive Mr. Putin proves to be in Beijing.
*03:20.320- 03:25.800* :  China will always be a good neighbor, good friend of mutual trust with Russia.
*03:28.440- 03:33.340* :  Mr. Xi's welcome was warm, but he didn't describe the partnership in lofty terms.
*03:33.340- 03:39.460* :  Two years ago, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, the relationship was said to be
*03:39.500- 03:48.160* :  limitless, not now. China has become Russia's lifeline after the West imposed sanctions for its
*03:48.160- 03:56.460* :  invasion of Ukraine. But Washington claims some of that trade helps build Russian drones and tanks
*03:56.540- 04:03.680* :  and is threatening to punish Beijing with more sanctions. That puts Mr. Xi in an awkward position.
*04:03.680- 04:09.260* :  He wants Russia by his side to counter what he sees as the U.S.-led world order,
*04:09.840- 04:14.100* :  but he also wants stabilize with the West to help his own sluggish economy.
*04:15.640- 04:20.440* :  There are signs that the war in Ukraine has altered this relationship, and sympathy for
*04:20.440- 04:23.720* :  Ukrainians is beginning to seek through state propaganda.
*04:24.500- 04:30.320* :  When the war started, full-scale invasion started, everybody decided how can he or she help
*04:30.540- 04:34.900* :  the Ukraine. Vita Golod, chairman of the Board of Ukrainian Association of Synologists,
*04:34.900- 04:40.720* :  was in Kiev when the war broke out and spoke fluent Mandarin. She decided to translate
*04:40.720- 04:44.520* :  Ukrainian news to put on Chinese social media.
*04:44.760- 04:49.400* :  Just to let people in China understand what's going on in Ukraine,
*04:49.960- 04:55.360* :  just let them know the truth about this war, and trying to fight the Russian propaganda.
*04:55.460- 05:04.600* :  Because when you use a time that there were no Ukrainian official media agencies outlets in China,
*05:04.600- 05:13.820* :  it was tough emotionally to be honest, and it took a lot of time. But 100 people were working hard.
*05:15.040- 05:20.520* :  Chinese state media claimed Russia had no choice but to invade Ukraine due to NATO expansion,
*05:20.700- 05:23.600* :  and it doesn't highlight allegations of war crimes.
*05:26.920- 05:32.980* :  Chinese artist Shu Wei Xin also felt compelled to act as thunderous explosions hit Kiev
*05:32.980- 05:34.500* :  in February 2022.
*05:35.340- 05:44.240* :  I don't have a weapon, but I have my pen. I've been painting every day since the war began.
*05:45.360- 05:53.040* :  I didn't stop even for one day. When I got COVID, when I traveled aboard, I still drew every day.
*05:53.860- 06:00.600* :  Some of my friends unfriended me because they held different views. But what I can do,
*06:01.540- 06:06.380* :  I believe I'm doing a right thing. I want to be a real model for my daughter.
*06:07.700- 06:13.020* :  Neither are censored on state media, which implies a level of tolerance by the Chinese government.
*06:16.760- 06:20.180* :  This is not likely to result in a major policy shift by Beijing,
*06:20.180- 06:26.180* :  but Mr Shu will likely be calculating the risk of standing shoulder to shoulder with what the
*06:26.180- 06:27.960* :  West is as a pariah.
*06:30.960- 06:35.660* :  That report by Laura Bicker. Slovakia's president has appealed to the country's
*06:35.660- 06:41.420* :  political leaders not create an atmosphere of hatred after an assassination attempt on the country's
*06:41.420- 06:46.860* :  prime minister. Robert Feetso remains in a serious condition in hospital after he was shot
*06:46.860- 06:51.040* :  multiple times on Wednesday while on a visit to the central town of Handlover.
*06:51.520- 06:54.700* :  The government is describing the attack as politically motivated,
*06:54.700- 06:58.600* :  a suspect has been detained and charged with attempted murder.
*06:59.180- 07:05.100* :  President Shujana Chappatova called for calm while urging politicians to come together to discuss
*07:05.100- 07:11.860* :  the situation. Yesterday's attack on prime minister Robert Feetso is above all a great human
*07:11.860- 07:16.360* :  tragedy, but at the same time it is also an attack on a democratic establishment.
*07:17.520- 07:22.420* :  That's why I'm asking everyone to think about his quick recovery and to take a responsible approach.
*07:23.600- 07:28.540* :  Let's step out of the vicious circle and mutual blame. What happened yesterday was individual
*07:28.540- 07:32.020* :  act by the stand-up atmosphere of hatred, which I call it before.
*07:32.940- 07:38.600* :  Slovakia's deputy prime minister Robert Kalinak says Mr Feetso's injuries are extensive.
*07:39.200- 07:42.000* :  He gave this update on the prime minister's condition in a news conference.
*07:42.900- 07:50.300* :  Unfortunately, at the moment I cannot state that the prognosis is positive because this scope of
*07:50.300- 08:03.860* :  injuries that were caused by four bullets is so widespread. The doctors succeeded in stabilizing
*08:03.860- 08:13.340* :  the medical state. However, we are still not beyond the risk to the life of the prime minister,
*08:13.980- 08:18.560* :  but we will inform you in the forthcoming hours about the current situation and the progress.
*08:19.920- 08:24.000* :  We got more from our reporter in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava Bethany Bell.
*08:24.600- 08:31.520* :  Still in a very serious condition, according to Mr Kalinak there, and he said that his injuries
*08:31.520- 08:41.000* :  were complicated. Another deputy prime minister, Thomas Taraba, told the BBC earlier that Mr Feetso
*08:41.000- 08:47.300* :  had been shot at very close range, wounded in the stomach, and what he said was the joint.
*08:48.080- 08:54.900* :  This is a time where many people waiting for each update on his state of health,
*08:55.320- 09:00.600* :  as he still remains in this very serious condition after a number of hours of surgery.
*09:01.520- 09:07.800* :  A lot of people also waiting for answers to the question, what was the motive or who was this person
*09:07.860- 09:14.620* :  who tried to kill the prime minister? Yes, and still very much waiting on the police investigation
*09:14.720- 09:20.360* :  for that. There is a lot of speculation in the media on social media as to who this man was.
*09:20.820- 09:29.080* :  We understand he is in his 70s. There is a piece of footage, very, very short showing a man
*09:29.640- 09:35.440* :  believed to be the suspect, but we do not know whether it is or not, for sure, saying he disagreed
*09:35.440- 09:41.140* :  with government policy and it starts towards state media. Again, that has not been confirmed,
*09:41.820- 09:48.700* :  but all of this is leading to a real sense of uncertainty, confusion, shock in this country,
*09:49.220- 09:55.260* :  and there are already a number of politicians in Mr Feetso's side who are blaming the
*09:55.260- 10:02.940* :  opposition figures saying that the sort of fibrile atmosphere in this country and its politics
*10:02.940- 10:09.580* :  isn't helping the whole situation. Bethany Bell in Slovakia. A decade ago, Donald Trump
*10:09.580- 10:15.520* :  wanted to build a luxury hotel complex in the Serbian capital, Belgrade. Now his son-in-law
*10:15.520- 10:20.440* :  has been given the green light to redevelop a building that was destroyed by NATO airstrikes.
*10:20.960- 10:26.280* :  The defence ministry was bombed repeatedly by NATO forces during the Kosovo war in 1999.
*10:26.280- 10:31.860* :  Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, says he plans to turn the site
*10:31.860- 10:37.940* :  into a hotel. But the project has caused outrage in Serbia, where the ruins of the building have
*10:37.940- 10:43.320* :  become a memorial to those killed in the NATO bombing campaign. Our Balkans correspondent is
*10:43.320- 10:48.980* :  Guy Deloni. The plan involves, first of all, a 99 year lease. This is between the government of
*10:48.980- 10:55.300* :  Serbia and the finity global development, which is a company that's founded by Jared Kushner.
*10:55.920- 11:02.020* :  And what this agreement involves is still the details are still being filled in,
*11:02.660- 11:07.880* :  but part of the conditions are for a memorial centre to be built. And everything that we've heard
*11:07.880- 11:12.200* :  up until this point, and these discussions have been going on for some time, is that there's
*11:12.200- 11:18.340* :  also going to be a hotel on the site. Now, this is controversial for a few different reasons.
*11:18.340- 11:23.980* :  Firstly, as you say, people are asking, why would we have a hotel on a site, which has been
*11:23.980- 11:31.680* :  protected as a cultural monument, since 2005, as a memorial to people who died in the 1999 NATO
*11:31.680- 11:36.640* :  airstrikes. That's one issue. And then the second issue is, if we are going to have any sort of
*11:36.640- 11:42.780* :  redevelopment, why is it being done in this way, in a way which people do not feel as transparent,
*11:42.780- 11:47.880* :  there's not been a tender, there's not been any sort of public consultation, and people are asking
*11:47.880- 11:53.580* :  when it's such an important site in the centre of Belgrade, why haven't we had more of a discussion
*11:53.580- 11:58.740* :  about it, and how everybody feels about it? Well, yes, Serbia still describes the NATO bombing as
*11:58.740- 12:05.740* :  aggression, and many say that this redevelopment could potentially reopen wounds from that conflict.
*12:06.260- 12:12.540* :  Or, on the other hand, as Jared Kushner's company says, it could build bridges between cultures,
*12:13.160- 12:18.860* :  and I was talking today to somebody from an urban development organisation called the Ministry
*12:18.860- 12:23.840* :  of Space, who based in Belgrade. And, of course, they're not happy about the lack of transparency,
*12:23.900- 12:30.340* :  but they do say there's a certain degree of irony involved here, that for 25 years there hasn't
*12:30.340- 12:37.400* :  been any acknowledgement from the United States that what happened in 1999 with the NATO bombing,
*12:37.400- 12:43.040* :  which was US-led, very much US-led in 1999, there's never been an acknowledgement from the United
*12:43.040- 12:49.320* :  States that it did anything wrong, that it's always insisted that the defence ministry buildings
*12:49.320- 12:54.580* :  and other sites in Serbia and Montenegro were fully justified in the context of forcing Yugoslav
*12:54.580- 13:00.260* :  troops out of Kosovo. Now, if you've got the sun in law of a former president of the United States,
*13:00.260- 13:05.360* :  and who knows possibly future president of the United States, establishing a memorial on the site
*13:05.360- 13:11.400* :  of these defence ministry buildings, that from a symbolic point of view would be quite intriguing.
*13:15.160- 13:19.580* :  Around the world, many people have been affected by the cost of living crisis. In Nigeria,
*13:19.580- 13:26.600* :  the yearly inflation rate soared to more than 33% in April. It's the highest such rise for nearly
*13:26.600- 13:32.200* :  three decades. In simple terms, that means the prices for basic goods are rising much faster than
*13:32.200- 13:37.980* :  people's ability to afford them, causing great hardship for many Nigerians. At a day you,
*13:37.980- 13:43.420* :  at a Mouagu, is a risk consultant for Sange advisory specialising in investments in Africa.
*13:43.900- 13:48.860* :  He spoke to my colleague James Coppnell. It's very difficult for many low-income people here in
*13:48.860- 13:54.840* :  Nigeria because prices are changing all the time. So, for example, my cable TV company has raised
*13:54.840- 14:00.740* :  prices two times already in the last one year, and it's not just cable TV, the cost of the cable
*14:00.740- 14:06.700* :  TV subscriptions. It's everything from milk to prices at the barber shop to pretty much everything
*14:06.700- 14:11.160* :  really. That's what's going on right now, and it's really a hard time for many low-income people
*14:11.160- 14:17.040* :  in the country. And what's driving it? Well, the inflation in Nigeria right now is mostly structural.
*14:17.040- 14:22.840* :  The question is what's changing in the last one year? So, it's moved from 22% to almost 34%
*14:22.860- 14:28.100* :  in the last one year alone. First, there was a change of government about a year ago about this time
*14:28.100- 14:34.580* :  last year, and the new government started by trying to cut petrol subsidies. The result was that
*14:34.580- 14:40.420* :  petrol prices more than tripled overnight. And you know, the thing about Nigeria is that many people
*14:40.420- 14:46.540* :  because great power is not reliable, so many businesses depend on petrol and diesel and fuel to
*14:46.540- 14:52.860* :  generate electricity. So, the cost of producing goods and services really went up. In order to
*14:52.860- 14:58.300* :  distribute goods from 0.8 to B, you're going to have to put those goods on a vehicle that's going
*14:58.300- 15:03.940* :  to need petrol. So, prices really went up because the cost of producing and distributing those
*15:03.940- 15:09.160* :  goods and services went up. Apart from that, the government also changed the central bank leadership,
*15:09.160- 15:14.400* :  which then tried to change its foreign exchange management strategy. And the result was that,
*15:14.400- 15:19.820* :  you know, there were multiple currency devaluations and things like that. And as a result,
*15:19.820- 15:26.760* :  the currency depreciated by more than 70%. Last year, about this time last year, the
*15:26.760- 15:35.360* :  Nigeria was about $400 to $8. Today, it's nearly $1,500 to $1. So, you have a great deal of imported
*15:35.960- 15:40.000* :  inflation. Yeah, plenty of problems then. Are there obvious solutions to your mind?
*15:40.600- 15:44.560* :  Yeah, I think that's the thing. My opinion is that, you know, when it countries dealing with the
*15:44.560- 15:49.760* :  big economic crisis doesn't need for some big ideas. So, for example, in the 60s in the United
*15:49.760- 15:55.020* :  States, when the national poverty rate was almost 20%, President Johnson responded with the war
*15:55.020- 16:01.220* :  and poverty. That's a big idea. What is Nigeria's big idea to this? It's very difficult to pinpoint
*16:01.220- 16:05.400* :  what that idea is. So, what you see is that every now and then the finance ministers and TV
*16:05.400- 16:10.300* :  announced in this new theme, that new theme every week. The centre back is where it is in press
*16:10.300- 16:15.560* :  statements tinkering with the rules and changing things here and there. But there isn't a big idea
*16:16.360- 16:22.580* :  around which you can build something solid. Add a day, add a mowago speaking to James Coppnell.

*17:20.600- 17:25.160* :  The two countries were essentially enemies. That is of course an allegation that has been
*17:25.160- 17:29.520* :  leveled. Everybody had a different definition of what the problem was. Let's remember the
*17:29.520- 17:36.360* :  background of all these. The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service making sense
*17:36.360- 17:41.540* :  of the big stories. We're finding out why. What is the evidence? Let's analyse it.

*17:51.520- 17:56.740* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now, dating can be a difficult experience,
*17:56.740- 18:02.440* :  but the founder of the dating app, Bumble, Whitney Wolfherd, says artificial intelligence
*18:02.520- 18:08.640* :  could help you find your perfect match. You could in the near future be talking to
*18:09.380- 18:15.340* :  your AI dating concierge and you could share your insecurities. I just came out of a breakup.
*18:15.740- 18:21.020* :  I've commitment issues and it could help you train yourself into a better way of thinking about
*18:21.020- 18:25.640* :  yourself and then it could give you productive tips for communicating with other people.
*18:25.960- 18:30.220* :  If you want to get really out there, there is a world where your dating concierge could go and
*18:30.220- 18:36.360* :  date for you with other dating concierge. No, no, truly. And then you don't have to talk to 600
*18:36.360- 18:41.600* :  people. All of San Francisco for you say these are the three people you really ought to meet.
*18:42.860- 18:46.640* :  Well, that was a vision outlined by Bumble's founder at a recent technology summit.
*18:46.640- 18:50.820* :  But if that sounds like a dystopian nightmare to you rather than an ideal future,
*18:51.400- 18:55.920* :  our technology editor Zoe Kleinman says she thinks it will still be a while before it happens.
*18:56.620- 19:01.460* :  We've seen a lot of big advancements in AI tech just this week. We've seen from OpenAI and
*19:01.460- 19:06.040* :  Google tools that can talk you through a math lesson and find your glasses for you.
*19:06.040- 19:11.160* :  But I think we're still a little way off an AI program representing you and representing me
*19:11.160- 19:14.960* :  having a chat with each other and then deciding whether they think we get on in real life.
*19:15.020- 19:19.180* :  You know, that is a very sophisticated bit of machine learning and while the tech is advancing
*19:19.180- 19:23.140* :  faster becoming more human-like, I'm not sure that we're going to be there anytime soon.
*19:23.140- 19:28.740* :  Having said that, we do know that AI is used by dating apps. It's used to filter accounts.
*19:28.740- 19:32.580* :  It's used within the algorithms that throw up the matches for you.
*19:32.940- 19:37.120* :  And it wouldn't at all surprise me if people are using chatbots to maybe perfect their profiles
*19:37.120- 19:43.640* :  or craft that perfect introductory message. So I do think AI already has a role in the dating scene,
*19:44.120- 19:45.660* :  but not to that extent quite yet.
*19:45.800- 19:47.560* :  What are you going to do if you have to meet in real life?
*19:48.560- 19:50.740* :  Well, I think this is the challenge, isn't it?
*19:50.740- 19:56.900* :  As AI seeks to become increasingly convincingly human-like and that really is the mission.
*19:56.980- 20:01.180* :  In order to be truly useful, it's got to be accepted by us, it's got to be like us.
*20:01.480- 20:03.200* :  But that is a really difficult thing to do.
*20:03.340- 20:10.980* :  And the thing about relationships is that chemistry that is very, very hard to recreate using
*20:10.980- 20:14.360* :  computer programming. I mean, I don't know about you. I know plenty of couples, I mean one,
*20:14.360- 20:18.520* :  where on paper you have very little in common, but there's something that keeps you together
*20:18.520- 20:24.140* :  and makes you get on. And being able to get that in artificial intelligence, I just think
*20:24.140- 20:28.640* :  would be a big challenge for even the most sophisticated AI engineers.
*20:28.860- 20:33.380* :  If you take an app like Bumble, many are available and people use a variety of them,
*20:33.440- 20:38.960* :  why is that the goal to use AI more and more when it comes to romance, do you think?
*20:39.620- 20:45.460* :  Well, I think it's about narrowing the pool, isn't it? If you are using a particular app,
*20:45.460- 20:49.200* :  you're looking for a particular type of person, a particular area of the world,
*20:49.200- 20:55.640* :  whatever your preferences are, AI is very useful in terms of being able to filter down to exactly
*20:55.640- 21:01.100* :  the kind of matches that you're looking for. And I think probably also useful in terms of helping
*21:01.100- 21:05.500* :  you present yourself in your best way. I mean, people use AI tools to write their CDs, don't they
*21:05.500- 21:09.720* :  to apply for jobs? You know, it's already being used to help us present ourselves in the way
*21:09.720- 21:14.740* :  that we would like to the world. So I do think that it's going to get more interesting, isn't it?
*21:14.740- 21:18.460* :  But then ultimately, perhaps also more disappointing when you discover that the real use
*21:18.460- 21:24.160* :  isn't sophisticated as the AI you was. So you climb and speaking to Emma Barnett.
*21:24.960- 21:29.580* :  It's been more than two years since the eruption of the Hunger volcano in Tonga, the largest
*21:29.580- 21:35.000* :  volcanic explosion this century, at least four people were killed in the blast, which sent shockwaves
*21:35.000- 21:40.620* :  across the Pacific. Scientists have been researching the true extent of the destruction and a new study
*21:41.020- 21:44.520* :  reveals the impact on marine life. Yeah, the bit more reports.
*21:49.900- 21:55.480* :  When the Hunger Tonga, Hunger Harpy volcano exploded in January 2022, it hit the
*21:55.480- 22:01.140* :  arpeller go of Tonga, a huge cloud of ash sawed into the sky, 20 kilometers high,
*22:01.140- 22:07.580* :  a more than 500 kilometers wide. NASA said they'd never seen anything like it, as their satellites
*22:07.580- 22:13.480* :  captured shockwaves reverberating across the Pacific Ocean, even reaching the shores of Japan
*22:13.480- 22:19.780* :  and Peru, as well as destroying communities. A new study has found that the eruption had a devastating
*22:19.780- 22:26.340* :  impact on Tonga's marine life. Writing for Nature's Communications Earth Journal, scientists called
*22:26.340- 22:32.680* :  the explosion a mass mortality event for sea creatures. They found a thick layer of ash blanketed
*22:32.680- 22:39.160* :  the seabed, wiping out muscle and sea snail populations that once thrived. It also decimated
*22:39.160- 22:45.420* :  levels of plankton, a carbon absorbing organism which plays a key role at the bottom of the aquatic
*22:45.420- 22:55.020* :  food chain. The Hunger eruption still sparks huge scientific interest. Of Sean New Zealand,
*22:55.020- 23:00.040* :  we have at least 30 major volcanoes, so by looking at Hanoi, which was such a
*23:00.040- 23:06.600* :  devastating and violent eruption, what we're trying to do is to see it as to why this volcano
*23:06.620- 23:13.100* :  blew up sun violently. That's Cornel DeRond, principal scientist at GNS Science. On Wednesday,
*23:13.100- 23:18.420* :  they launched a research vessel on a month-long voyage to Tonga for what they planned to be the
*23:18.420- 23:25.160* :  most detailed survey of the volcano hit area. We believe that this eruption was due to sort of,
*23:25.620- 23:31.960* :  it was a gas driven eruption, some sort of carapace of minerals that sealed off inside the volcano.
*23:31.960- 23:37.300* :  As you might imagine, the pressure just built and built and built and boom up it goes. If that's
*23:37.300- 23:42.800* :  true, then what it means is that these volcanoes are far more dangerous than we previously thought.
*23:43.240- 23:48.400* :  The hope is that these findings will help us better predict when a super eruption might take place,
*23:48.400- 23:54.700* :  allowing more time for evacuation and saving more lives from these colossal forces of nature.
*23:55.960- 24:01.080* :  That report by Ella Bignore. Since its introduction in professional football around the world,
*24:01.080- 24:07.260* :  VAR or the video assistant referee has, I think it's fair to say, not been loved by many fans,
*24:07.260- 24:13.360* :  players or managers. The intentions were noble, using video replays to eradicate wrong decisions
*24:13.360- 24:19.180* :  from the game, but VAR has disrupted the flow of play, leaving fans and players waiting for
*24:19.180- 24:24.800* :  quite a while sometimes while decisions are made. Now, the 20 English Premier League clubs are
*24:24.800- 24:30.820* :  set to vote on whether to scrap VAR in a meeting next month. So, what do fans think? Here's our
*24:30.820- 24:37.680* :  sports correspondent, John Bennett. I think many fans have views about VAR that they agree with
*24:37.680- 24:41.780* :  Wolverhampton Wondra's that it should be scrapped. They have brought forward this vote, which will
*24:41.780- 24:46.160* :  happen next month, or the Premier League clubs will vote about whether to scrap it from as
*24:46.540- 24:51.100* :  early as next season on a high profile current player. Newcastle and England Wing Anthony
*24:51.100- 24:57.660* :  Gordon has said in the last 24 hours he doesn't understand the point of having VAR, but the actual
*24:57.660- 25:02.160* :  Premier League, they're fully behind the system. They argue that since it was introduced,
*25:02.160- 25:10.320* :  correct decisions in matches have increased from 82% before VAR to 96%. But Wolves, who've
*25:10.320- 25:14.600* :  triggered this vote, they say that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy
*25:14.620- 25:20.960* :  is at odds with the spirit of our game. And will they have the support they need because they
*25:20.960- 25:26.880* :  need 13 other clubs to join them as for this cert to pass? Yes, that's right. It's very difficult
*25:26.880- 25:32.060* :  to say how many other clubs will join Wolverhampton Wondra's because it's an extreme solution,
*25:32.120- 25:36.880* :  isn't it, to totally scrap it from next season? We know certain clubs have felt quite hard
*25:36.880- 25:41.240* :  done by this season, nottingham forest. For example, they released a statement after a game against
*25:41.240- 25:46.940* :  Everton saying their patience has been tested multiple times. But one thing is clear, I think
*25:46.940- 25:52.100* :  the actual Premier League, they will argue the case to keep VAR, they feel the system's working,
*25:52.700- 25:57.680* :  and they also believe that getting rid of the VAR would have a negative impact on the reputation
*25:57.680- 26:03.040* :  of the Premier League. Especially given that so much has been invested into it, surely the
*26:03.040- 26:08.720* :  solution is to improve it, not scrap it. Yeah, that's where I think this will go. I don't think
*26:08.720- 26:14.360* :  in the end that VAR will be scrapped, but I think this will lead to a wider debate about how
*26:14.360- 26:18.580* :  it can be improved. And the authorities say they are working to improve it. We're saying,
*26:18.580- 26:25.300* :  though, that one country, Sweden, they've become the first elite league in Europe to reject VAR,
*26:25.300- 26:31.840* :  so it has happened elsewhere. John Bennett, half a million people forced to abandon their homes
*26:31.840- 26:37.220* :  after they were inundated with flood water may have to suffer more severe flooding for weeks to
*26:37.220- 26:42.560* :  come, according to weather experts. Persistent rains mean that river levels have continued to rise
*26:42.560- 26:48.940* :  in the state of Rio Grande du Sole, nearly 150 people are confirmed to have died in the past couple
*26:48.940- 26:55.240* :  of weeks, with dozens more still missing. Dr Rafael Pratesl is an orthopedic and trauma surgeon
*26:55.240- 27:01.220* :  in the state capital Porto Allegri. He says the hospitals he works at are unable to carry out
*27:01.220- 27:06.720* :  operations because of the flooding and a shortage of clean water. One of the hustlers
*27:06.720- 27:15.860* :  I work on is shut because we have water until the first floor. The other hustle that are
*27:15.860- 27:23.840* :  performed surgeries, we're not supplied by water in a regular basis. So we have to shut some of
*27:23.840- 27:30.880* :  the operating rooms and we have only emergencies and the people that are ready on the hospital,
*27:31.640- 27:39.620* :  but we are not taking new patients and everything that is not emergency is unhold.
*27:40.680- 27:46.480* :  Well as the floods continue to wreak havoc and search and rescue operations are going on,
*27:46.480- 27:52.800* :  two Brazilians hoping for Olympic glory in Paris this July have emerged as unlikely heroes.
*27:53.400- 27:54.620* :  Alfie Habeson reports.
*28:00.080- 28:03.880* :  That's the sound of a valedomatized becker Ampiedro Tuchtenhagen,
*28:04.260- 28:08.040* :  hoisting their boat onto a submerged highway in Porto Allegri.
*28:08.720- 28:13.400* :  After massive accusations the city is eerily empty, apart from soldiers patrolling
*28:13.400- 28:20.840* :  its streets, with once towering rooftops peeking over the water. But people and pets remain trapped
*28:20.860- 28:29.540* :  and the two rowers are hoping to find them. If Aldo and I talked a lot and decided to give
*28:29.540- 28:35.340* :  up the pre-lympics and focus our energy on Rio Grande du Cholau, our state, to help our friends
*28:35.340- 28:41.040* :  and families. The pair were supposed to be traveling to Switzerland to compete in the qualifying
*28:41.040- 28:47.880* :  round for the Paris 2024 Olympics, but they say this is more important and they aren't the only
*28:47.880- 28:52.940* :  ones to swap glitz and glamour for search and rescue, because an Olympic swimmer and the
*28:52.940- 28:56.920* :  surf champion have also put aside their sporting commitments to join the operation,
*28:57.580- 29:03.760* :  as is the coach of the national judo team. But for the rowers the sacrifice appears to be even greater.
*29:07.900- 29:14.920* :  In addition to the water taking away several homes, it also took away some dreams.
*29:14.920- 29:24.860* :  It was my dream, Pietro's dream, to be able to participate in this Olympics in our category.
*29:25.780- 29:30.940* :  Because after Paris, the lightweight double skulls category will no longer be an Olympic event,
*29:31.680- 29:36.860* :  and that means they have given up a lifelong dream of winning a coveted Olympic medal to help
*29:36.860- 29:42.860* :  those in their home state caught up in one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit Southern
*29:42.860- 29:51.580* :  Brazil. And that report was by Alfie Haberson. And that's all from us for now, but there will be
*29:51.580- 29:56.260* :  a new edition of the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or topics

*30:09.220- 30:13.480* :  the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Janette Gillil. Until next time, goodbye.
*30:21.600- 30:25.640* :  So, how did it happen? Well actually that's a really important question.
*30:25.840- 30:30.400* :  The two countries were essentially enemies. That is of course an allegation that has been
*30:30.400- 30:34.780* :  leveled. Everybody had a different definition of what the problem was. Let's remember the
*30:34.780- 30:40.540* :  background of all these. The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service
*30:40.540- 30:46.780* :  making sense of the big stories. We're finding out why. What is the evidence? Let's analyse it.
