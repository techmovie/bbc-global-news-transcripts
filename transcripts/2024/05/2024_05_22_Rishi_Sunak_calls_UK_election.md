*01:19.220- 01:22.280* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:29.500- 01:33.600* :  The British Prime Minister calls a general election on the 4th of July.
*01:33.660- 01:39.880* :  Reaction from Palestinians and Israelis to the decision of Spain, Ireland and Norway to recognise
*01:39.880- 01:49.140* :  Palestine as a state. Also in this podcast, we basically produce super saturated hot,
*01:49.140- 01:56.920* :  humid air. When you condense water contain in that air, you would have the drinking water at
*01:57.260- 02:02.880* :  a new device that could prove life-saving during droughts or emergencies. And Colombia
*02:02.880- 02:06.280* :  buries Omar Helles, one of its most influential folk singers.
*02:11.460- 02:15.520* :  The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced a general election on the 4th of July.
*02:16.160- 02:20.440* :  It was something no one was predicting this time yesterday as the opposition labour party has a
*02:20.440- 02:25.680* :  commanding lead over the governing conservatives in opinion polls. Speaking in Downing Street,
*02:25.680- 02:30.040* :  in the pouring rain, Rishi Sunak made his pitch to voters, saying this was the moment
*02:30.080- 02:34.440* :  for Britain to choose its future, promising a clear plan and bold action.
*02:35.140- 02:38.060* :  Now is the moment for Britain to choose its future?
*02:39.140- 02:41.860* :  To decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made,
*02:42.460- 02:46.180* :  or risk going back to square one, with no plan and no certainty.
*02:47.460- 02:51.420* :  Earlier today, I spoke with his majesty, the King, to request the dissolution of parliament.
*02:52.500- 02:57.200* :  The King has granted this request and we will have a general election on the 4th of July.
*02:57.200- 03:03.980* :  These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to chart a course to a secure future.
*03:04.700- 03:09.640* :  In Britain, the timing of elections is in the gift of the Prime Minister, so why call one now?
*03:09.640- 03:12.800* :  I've been talking to our political correspondent Rob Watson.
*03:13.320- 03:17.460* :  Why is he doing it? Well, the speculation is that he's made the calculation that this is
*03:17.560- 03:21.180* :  probably as good as it's going to get for the governing conservative party,
*03:21.180- 03:25.220* :  that although they are a long way behind in the opinion polls,
*03:25.220- 03:28.340* :  really spectacularly way behind an unpopular,
*03:28.900- 03:31.320* :  there has been somewhat better news on inflation,
*03:31.320- 03:37.340* :  somewhat better news on economic growth, and I suspect Mr Sunak fears that if you think about
*03:37.340- 03:41.020* :  the main problem the conservatives are up against, that is political gravity,
*03:41.020- 03:46.860* :  having been in power for 14 years and no certainty that actually economic progress
*03:47.360- 03:51.960* :  will continue, you might as well cut your losses and go for an election now.
*03:51.960- 03:58.080* :  But this has been consistently something like a 21% lead for the main opposition
*03:58.080- 04:02.360* :  Labour Party, not for a few weeks, not for a few months, but for over a year.
*04:02.360- 04:07.500* :  And I think again it goes back to that issue of political gravity and of course that
*04:07.500- 04:12.660* :  the record in office. Now, Rishi Sunak's pitch to voters is about the economy.
*04:12.660- 04:17.060* :  It is the day when inflation fell, perhaps more than people were expecting.
*04:17.120- 04:20.120* :  It's a message of, we're on the right track, better than W.
*04:21.220- 04:23.040* :  Yes, I'm glad you laid it out that way.
*04:23.060- 04:25.900* :  They will say that the Americans say there's only three kinds of elections,
*04:26.540- 04:28.240* :  basically, we're on the right track, number one,
*04:28.580- 04:30.600* :  better than W, you know, or time for a change.
*04:30.600- 04:34.340* :  And the conservatives are going for a sort of mix of one and two,
*04:34.340- 04:38.160* :  and Rishi Sunak was essentially saying goodness, look at the world out there,
*04:38.220- 04:42.640* :  that the war in Ukraine, the uncertainty in the Middle East,
*04:42.900- 04:48.280* :  this is really a time for change to an unknown opposition, to an uncharted opposition,
*04:48.340- 04:52.880* :  whereas of course what we've had from the main opposition Labour Party so far
*04:52.880- 04:56.420* :  and that to lead a secure storm is exactly that word change.
*04:56.840- 04:57.860* :  It is time for a change.
*04:57.860- 05:02.140* :  He argues the party argues after 14 years of what he calls chaos.
*05:02.520- 05:05.020* :  Let's hear what secure stormer had to say an hour ago.
*05:05.720- 05:07.660* :  On the 4th of July, you have the choice.
*05:08.400- 05:13.060* :  And together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page,
*05:13.060- 05:17.240* :  we can start to rebuild Britain and change our country.
*05:18.020- 05:20.340* :  Time and again, they pursue their own interests,
*05:21.320- 05:24.480* :  rather than tackling the issues that affect your family.
*05:25.580- 05:29.880* :  And if they get another five years, they will have feel entitled
*05:30.520- 05:32.520* :  to carry on exactly as they are.
*05:33.740- 05:34.920* :  Nothing will change.
*05:36.140- 05:38.960* :  We're going to hear secure stormer playing that potent political
*05:39.440- 05:43.440* :  card of change all the time I should think in terms of what the issues will be
*05:43.440- 05:45.680* :  in the coming weeks in the election campaign, Rob.
*05:45.680- 05:49.800* :  Obviously the economy, that's always there, migration, the NHS.
*05:50.460- 05:53.400* :  I mean, I think in a way it'll be like a giant hole, won't it?
*05:53.400- 05:56.560* :  It'll be a mix of all of those things that the Labour Party will be saying,
*05:56.560- 06:00.000* :  look, do you, after 14 years of Conservative Government,
*06:00.000- 06:01.360* :  do you feel better off?
*06:01.360- 06:03.780* :  Do you feel like public services are working?
*06:03.780- 06:06.560* :  Well, do you feel like the zeitgeist of the country in its place
*06:07.080- 06:08.620* :  in the whole world is a good thing?
*06:09.020- 06:12.100* :  And obviously expecting the voters to say no.
*06:12.540- 06:15.820* :  And the polling suggests that the voters do feel very negatively about those things,
*06:15.820- 06:19.240* :  whereas the Conservatives will be saying repeatedly,
*06:19.260- 06:22.940* :  look, we may not be perfect, but you know us.
*06:23.260- 06:25.080* :  We've had some slightly better figures.
*06:25.580- 06:28.240* :  And the opposition, they don't really have a plan.
*06:28.700- 06:31.060* :  You know, in many ways, and you already know,
*06:31.060- 06:33.520* :  although it's only the election is only a couple of hours old,
*06:33.520- 06:37.880* :  we know exactly what the sort of nature of the contest will be in that sense.
*06:38.680- 06:41.220* :  When we get to polling down July 4th,
*06:41.220- 06:44.440* :  Rishi Sunak will have been Prime Minister for less than two years,
*06:44.440- 06:47.560* :  who knows whether he gets the chance to continue or not.
*06:47.620- 06:49.700* :  But in terms of his legacy so far,
*06:50.120- 06:52.060* :  he was Finance Minister during COVID.
*06:52.060- 06:56.020* :  He's complained to have stabilised the economy as Prime Minister.
*06:56.260- 06:59.360* :  Probably the biggest thing he'll end up being remembered for is banning smoking.
*07:00.800- 07:02.620* :  It's interesting you should raise that.
*07:02.740- 07:04.400* :  And I don't think he would particularly mind that.
*07:04.400- 07:07.540* :  I mean, clearly he would like to win a general election.
*07:07.940- 07:11.180* :  And he will make the case over the next few weeks as to why that should be.
*07:11.660- 07:14.320* :  But he obviously feels very passionately about this.
*07:14.320- 07:18.300* :  I say that because there's a large chunk of the government Conservative Party
*07:18.300- 07:20.640* :  that hates this idea of sort of nanny status.
*07:20.640- 07:22.620* :  And so you're absolutely right.
*07:22.620- 07:24.440* :  I mean, if he does lose the selection,
*07:24.440- 07:27.600* :  maybe the sort of economic policies will be long forgotten.
*07:27.600- 07:29.380* :  Most of what he do will be forgotten.
*07:29.380- 07:32.360* :  But not perhaps taking the most radical approach
*07:32.360- 07:35.060* :  to eliminating smoking of any Western country.
*07:35.520- 07:38.400* :  And just finally, it's been a fever day at Westminster.
*07:38.400- 07:41.080* :  Rob, do you feel ready for weeks of this,
*07:41.080- 07:43.800* :  for weeks of this conversation, TV debates, all that stuff?
*07:43.920- 07:45.360* :  I did want to raise a couple of points.
*07:45.400- 07:48.860* :  And number one is that this election is going to be taking
*07:48.860- 07:50.740* :  against a pretty sour backdrop.
*07:50.740- 07:52.800* :  The opinion polling and focus groups,
*07:52.800- 07:55.020* :  it's really shocking, Andrew, the extent to which,
*07:55.540- 07:58.300* :  you know, the voters just don't like any of the politicians
*07:58.500- 07:59.660* :  or the political parties.
*07:59.660- 08:01.400* :  I mean, it is really striking.
*08:01.940- 08:04.060* :  The other thing that I would say is that this election
*08:04.140- 08:06.600* :  is taking place against a sour mood in the sense
*08:06.600- 08:09.540* :  that this feels like a country that senses
*08:09.540- 08:12.180* :  that it's on the wrong track and that life is getting worse.
*08:12.180- 08:14.720* :  So it's going to be a big battle for the politicians.
*08:15.520- 08:17.460* :  Our political correspondent, Rob Watson.
*08:18.140- 08:20.380* :  In our earlier podcast, we reported on the news
*08:20.380- 08:23.640* :  that Ireland, Norway and Spain are to recognise Palestine
*08:23.640- 08:25.100* :  as an independent state.
*08:25.100- 08:28.200* :  Let's get some reaction now from Israel and the Palestinians.
*08:28.200- 08:31.040* :  First, our diplomatic correspondent, James Lander,
*08:31.040- 08:32.880* :  on the significance of this decision.
*08:33.840- 08:35.800* :  Most countries in the world already think
*08:35.800- 08:37.560* :  the Palestinians have a state.
*08:38.000- 08:40.460* :  143 nations voted to that effect
*08:40.460- 08:42.280* :  at the United Nations earlier this month.
*08:42.680- 08:44.720* :  So adding another three to the list
*08:44.720- 08:46.400* :  might not seem that important.
*08:46.400- 08:50.040* :  But the decision by Norway, Spain and the Republic of Ireland
*08:50.060- 08:51.980* :  to recognise Palestinians stated
*08:52.340- 08:54.120* :  is unusual and significant.
*08:54.660- 08:57.700* :  Only nine European countries have already made that decision.
*08:57.700- 09:00.260* :  And most did so in 1988.
*09:01.040- 09:03.180* :  Norway's Prime Minister, Jonas Casturra,
*09:03.320- 09:06.380* :  said peace in the Middle East required a Palestinian state.
*09:06.960- 09:11.300* :  Spain's premier, Pedro Sanchez, said he hoped it would help secure a ceasefire.
*09:11.780- 09:14.620* :  Ireland's T-Shock, Simon Harris, said the Palestinians
*09:14.620- 09:16.860* :  had a legitimate right to statehood.
*09:17.540- 09:19.620* :  The Irish, Spanish and Norwegian decision
*09:19.620- 09:23.260* :  will put some pressure on other European countries to follow suit.
*09:23.700- 09:25.460* :  But many, including the United States,
*09:25.460- 09:27.580* :  believe this is too early
*09:27.780- 09:30.580* :  that recognising a Palestinian state should come later
*09:30.580- 09:34.080* :  to drive momentum towards a long-term political settlement.
*09:34.700- 09:36.620* :  There are also many unanswered questions
*09:36.620- 09:38.880* :  about where the borders and capital
*09:39.100- 09:41.100* :  of any Palestinian state may lie.
*09:41.880- 09:44.000* :  So the diplomatic dial shifted
*09:44.400- 09:46.340* :  with some symbolic declarations,
*09:46.380- 09:49.840* :  but the reality on the ground is unlikely to change.
*09:50.760- 09:53.480* :  The presidency of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah
*09:53.480- 09:56.380* :  has welcomed the move and called on others to follow suit.
*09:56.940- 10:00.460* :  Amar Hijazi, the Assistant Minister of Multilateral Affairs in Ramallah,
*10:00.700- 10:02.560* :  described it as crucial for peace.
*10:03.100- 10:06.720* :  In our opinion, this step comes at a critical hour
*10:07.500- 10:13.460* :  when Israel and the occupation is trying to derail this conflict
*10:14.560- 10:18.580* :  and destroy the chances to achieve peace between peoples.
*10:18.580- 10:22.400* :  These countries stood up to say that the only path to peace
*10:22.840- 10:26.800* :  and the only path to justice and security in this region
*10:27.320- 10:30.640* :  is by granting the Palestinian people their independence,
*10:30.640- 10:34.900* :  their rights, and in particular their right to solve the termination.
*10:35.300- 10:37.040* :  Hamas also welcomed the decision
*10:37.500- 10:39.260* :  and here are some views from people in Gaza.
*10:39.940- 10:43.560* :  We hope this decision will be implemented
*10:43.560- 10:46.380* :  and that a Palestinian state will be established
*10:46.380- 10:48.740* :  along the 1967 borders
*10:49.320- 10:51.360* :  on the basis of the two-state solution
*10:51.800- 10:53.180* :  as the international community,
*10:53.980- 10:55.780* :  European and Arab states demand.
*10:56.840- 10:59.400* :  We are peace and life-loving people
*10:59.960- 11:01.620* :  and want to coexist with everyone
*11:01.620- 11:04.160* :  from every persuasion and religion.
*11:06.480- 11:07.460* :  I hope that it will happen,
*11:07.460- 11:09.820* :  but it's difficult to achieve peace with Israel
*11:09.820- 11:13.380* :  without guarantees from superpowers such as the US or France.
*11:16.400- 11:19.560* :  It's a good step, but it's unfortunately a belated one.
*11:20.000- 11:22.160* :  After more than 70 years of occupation,
*11:22.200- 11:25.240* :  they finally recognized the state of Palestine.
*11:26.100- 11:27.760* :  But Israelis have reacted with anger.
*11:28.160- 11:31.880* :  Speaking in Paris, the foreign minister Israel Katz said they do everything they could
*11:31.880- 11:32.820* :  to block the move.
*11:33.220- 11:36.740* :  Until Heinrich spoke's person for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:37.060- 11:39.000* :  said it would send the wrong message to the world.
*11:39.780- 11:41.900* :  We said many weeks ago and months ago,
*11:41.900- 11:44.600* :  James said a recognition of a Palestinian state
*11:44.600- 11:46.280* :  would be an unprecedented,
*11:47.260- 11:48.680* :  enormous prize for terrorism
*11:49.300- 11:52.220* :  that would achieve exactly the opposite of peace.
*11:52.800- 11:57.100* :  And unfortunately, Spain, Norway, Ireland as you noted
*11:57.100- 11:59.300* :  have joined this list of countries that you mentioned
*11:59.300- 12:01.860* :  they're playing right into Hamas's hands.
*12:02.780- 12:06.040* :  They are incentivizing their sick methods of war,
*12:06.560- 12:08.240* :  their sick monstrous regime,
*12:08.240- 12:11.860* :  and undermining efforts to release our hostages,
*12:11.860- 12:12.740* :  our stolen people.
*12:12.740- 12:14.420* :  You know, appeasing terrorists
*12:14.420- 12:16.660* :  never penned out wealth throughout history.
*12:16.660- 12:18.980* :  This is a reward for the ones who planned
*12:18.980- 12:21.460* :  and executed the October 7th massacre.
*12:21.840- 12:23.440* :  It's a prize for the rapists,
*12:23.440- 12:26.180* :  the murderers, the ones who are still holding
*12:26.180- 12:27.680* :  our stolen people in captivity.
*12:29.160- 12:30.720* :  How is it a reward for Hamas?
*12:30.740- 12:32.240* :  I mean, they're not going to be in charge
*12:32.660- 12:34.360* :  in Gaza after the war, are they?
*12:34.920- 12:37.760* :  What are the real impediments to peace?
*12:38.060- 12:39.980* :  Palestinians don't want the state next to Israel.
*12:40.320- 12:41.640* :  They want the state instead of Israel.
*12:41.800- 12:43.760* :  This is why they chant from the river to the sea.
*12:43.900- 12:47.060* :  Norway explicitly said today that their move was designed
*12:47.060- 12:50.320* :  to encourage those moderate forces
*12:50.320- 12:52.680* :  who've been sidelined by groups like Hamas.
*12:54.160- 12:55.520* :  But this is not what it's doing.
*12:56.100- 12:58.980* :  It encourages if perpetuates war,
*12:59.480- 13:01.280* :  more conflict, and more bloodshed.
*13:01.580- 13:02.060* :  Not less.
*13:02.740- 13:04.520* :  Tahanrek with James Menendez.
*13:04.860- 13:06.420* :  This was the reaction in Jerusalem.
*13:08.560- 13:10.080* :  The countries that want to recognize
*13:10.080- 13:14.760* :  a Palestinian state are probably starting from the assumption
*13:15.560- 13:18.120* :  that the Palestinians want to establish a state
*13:18.120- 13:22.320* :  according to the principle of two states for two peoples.
*13:23.860- 13:26.240* :  But this assumption is incorrect
*13:26.240- 13:29.600* :  because if the Palestinians wanted to establish
*13:29.600- 13:32.720* :  a Palestinian state alongside Israel,
*13:33.640- 13:35.760* :  they could have done it a long time ago.
*13:38.720- 13:41.920* :  I feel that the timing now to recognize a Palestinian state
*13:41.920- 13:45.060* :  during a war and after the events of October 7th
*13:45.460- 13:47.000* :  shows who these countries are with
*13:47.000- 13:49.400* :  and what their opinion is about everything
*13:49.400- 13:51.560* :  that happened here on October 7th.
*13:52.360- 13:54.940* :  And to see that the world actually takes the side of Hamas
*13:54.940- 13:57.420* :  and says, I will give you a status or award,
*13:57.920- 14:00.940* :  that is painful and I wish things could be seen differently.
*14:02.000- 14:03.400* :  Some views from Jerusalem.
*14:04.200- 14:07.860* :  A device that absorbs water from air to produce drinking water
*14:07.860- 14:09.920* :  has been officially launched in Australia.
*14:10.480- 14:12.980* :  Researchers say the so-called hydroharvester
*14:12.980- 14:15.560* :  could be life-saving during droughts or emergencies.
*14:16.260- 14:17.960* :  Its developers say it's cheap to run
*14:17.960- 14:20.600* :  and uses either solar energy or waste heat
*14:20.600- 14:22.700* :  from industrial processes or machines.
*14:23.340- 14:24.680* :  From Sydney, here's Phil Mercer.
*14:25.200- 14:27.240* :  Drought is like a creeping cancer
*14:27.840- 14:31.020* :  according to engineers at the University of Newcastle
*14:31.020- 14:32.160* :  in New South Wales.
*14:33.160- 14:36.660* :  Their hydroharvester absorbs moisture from the air
*14:37.180- 14:39.300* :  and can produce up to a thousand litres
*14:39.300- 14:41.480* :  of drinkable water each day.
*14:42.500- 14:46.140* :  Unlike other commercially available atmospheric water generators,
*14:46.820- 14:50.540* :  the Australian team led by Professor Baedad Mock Deteri
*14:50.900- 14:54.900* :  says the invention works by heating air instead of cooling it.
*14:55.400- 14:57.760* :  Hydroharvester uses an absorbent material
*14:57.760- 15:00.480* :  to absorb and dissolve moisture from air.
*15:01.020- 15:03.480* :  So essentially we use renewable energy,
*15:03.480- 15:06.220* :  let's say for instance solar energy or waste heat.
*15:06.900- 15:10.480* :  We basically produce super saturated hot,
*15:10.540- 15:13.280* :  humid air out of the system.
*15:14.080- 15:17.580* :  When you condense water contained in that air,
*15:18.080- 15:20.560* :  you would have the drinking water at your disposal.
*15:20.720- 15:24.860* :  The researchers say the device can produce enough drinking water each day
*15:25.340- 15:26.920* :  for up to 400 people.
*15:27.920- 15:31.860* :  It could also help farmers keep livestock alive during droughts
*15:32.160- 15:34.920* :  and can function when humidity levels are low.
*15:35.280- 15:38.880* :  Given that it can work and like other atmospheric water
*15:39.340- 15:44.840* :  which are usually work best around the humidity of 50 or 60 percent,
*15:44.840- 15:49.940* :  our system can go down all the way to, you know, 10 or even 5 percent if we want to.
*15:50.660- 15:55.980* :  And for that reason, yes, even in arid, dry climates like
*15:55.980- 16:00.280* :  in Australia made the least, it would work perfectly well.
*16:00.600- 16:06.860* :  The hydroharvester will be tested in several remote Australian communities later this year.
*16:07.860- 16:08.980* :  Next to Colombia.
*16:17.940- 16:21.540* :  Omar Heller is one of the greatest folk musicians in Colombia has died.
*16:21.540- 16:26.080* :  The Vianato musician was 57 but had a career lasting four decades.
*16:26.720- 16:28.800* :  My colleague Clizia Sala told me more about him.
*16:29.240- 16:31.200* :  He rose to fame in the 80s.
*16:31.200- 16:34.040* :  He was part of this group called Los Diablitos,
*16:34.420- 16:35.800* :  meaning the little devils.
*16:36.320- 16:40.200* :  And throughout his career, he wrote over 800 songs.
*16:41.100- 16:45.300* :  And I think his most important contribution to the genre was
*16:45.780- 16:50.180* :  mixing Vianato with rock, bringing it to the younger generation.
*16:50.360- 16:53.420* :  So Vianato is very traditional and he was giving it a more contemporary twist.
*16:54.080- 16:58.940* :  So Vianato is very traditional music style which hails from Vajigupar,
*16:59.300- 17:02.680* :  which is actually where Heller spent most of his life.
*17:03.420- 17:08.020* :  And in 2015, the genre was inscribed on the list of UNESCO's
*17:08.120- 17:09.780* :  intangible cultural heritage.
*17:09.980- 17:17.120* :  So traditionally, it is played with a small drum and a wooden ribbed stick and an accordion.
*17:17.840- 17:23.780* :  And Mr Heller's created one of the genre's most iconic songs,
*17:23.780- 17:28.860* :  called Los Caminos de la Vida, meaning the journey of life or the parts of life.
*17:41.880- 17:47.060* :  The lyrics tell the story of a single mother struggling to raise her family,
*17:47.180- 17:55.320* :  and it's sort of become an anthem for several generations and a tribute to the strength and love of mothers.
*18:04.700- 18:09.080* :  And just give us a sense of what influence he had beyond Colombia,
*18:09.080- 18:12.340* :  because he wasn't restricted to Vianato music in Colombia.
*18:12.860- 18:16.060* :  Well, actually, yes, of course, in the US.
*18:16.060- 18:21.880* :  There is a great flow of migrants from Colombia and second-generation Colombians.
*18:22.180- 18:26.620* :  He has a huge following there, but also in other countries in South America.
*18:27.320- 18:29.880* :  And in terms of people's affection for him,
*18:30.560- 18:34.520* :  there's going to be a huge sculpture of him as part of the funeral procession.
*18:34.620- 18:41.380* :  Yes, there's a life-sized sculpture of him, which is going to accompany the funeral procession,
*18:41.880- 18:49.260* :  and actually as a tribute to his life and his work, the statue will then be installed in the
*18:49.260- 18:57.280* :  cultural center for Vianato music in Valladu Par, which is actually considered the capital of Vianato.
*19:04.980- 19:07.740* :  Vianato musician Omar Helles, who's died.
*19:10.600- 19:11.340* :  And still to come.
*19:16.220- 19:19.620* :  A rare standing ovation for a member of the British Parliament,
*19:19.620- 19:23.400* :  and also a mammoth discovery in an Australian wine cellar.
*19:30.760- 19:34.020* :  Kids always losing their keys, the library got stolen again,

*20:38.540- 20:40.480* :  South Africa's former president, Jacob Zuma,
*20:40.480- 20:43.020* :  has said he wants to change the country's constitution
*20:43.420- 20:46.380* :  after being barred from running for parliament in next week's elections.
*20:47.140- 20:50.660* :  In his first interview since the ruling, Mr. Zuma Toma Koli and Soy,
*20:51.100- 20:55.480* :  the country's constitutional court was wrong to decide he was ineligible to run
*20:55.480- 20:59.060* :  based on his 2021 conviction for contempt of court.
*21:00.000- 21:02.400* :  I appeared before the commission of a judge
*21:02.920- 21:05.920* :  who is in charge of the charges of the constitutional court.
*21:06.400- 21:10.240* :  And I said it to him, he is a man I know.
*21:11.060- 21:14.460* :  He can't deal with my issues.
*21:15.260- 21:17.060* :  I need somebody else to do so.
*21:17.460- 21:21.340* :  I did not refuse to address the issues.
*21:22.460- 21:24.140* :  They say I'm guilty.
*21:25.080- 21:29.080* :  They've not even talked to me and they sent me to prison for 15 months,
*21:29.620- 21:30.360* :  which I served.
*21:32.040- 21:34.400* :  You can't tell me there's democracy in this country.
*21:35.100- 21:37.320* :  Well, some of the observers, internationally though,
*21:37.320- 21:41.060* :  thought that perhaps you did not want to answer these questions.
*21:41.500- 21:42.420* :  That's their own business.
*21:42.420- 21:43.420* :  That's not my business.
*21:43.420- 21:44.500* :  For the time you were president.
*21:44.500- 21:47.380* :  No, what I'm telling you now must tell you,
*21:48.120- 21:49.840* :  I fought for freedom my dear.
*21:50.360- 21:53.380* :  And I cannot look at myself.
*21:54.440- 21:59.080* :  My right is that I fought for a state in prison for being messed up by a person
*21:59.080- 21:59.980* :  towards as a judge.
*22:00.800- 22:01.580* :  Where is fairness?
*22:03.120- 22:06.640* :  Well, apart from you being sent to prison for contempt of court,
*22:06.640- 22:13.640* :  your own former party should I say prematurely ended your presidency on corruption allegations.
*22:14.780- 22:16.740* :  No, it was not on corruption allegations.
*22:16.880- 22:18.420* :  Please, we are making a big mistake.
*22:19.720- 22:22.520* :  There was no corruption that was ever found on me.
*22:23.460- 22:26.040* :  Singing about the Zuma's corruption was a lot.
*22:26.080- 22:29.360* :  But who has purchased anything to have any evidence?
*22:29.780- 22:31.060* :  Some call it state capture.
*22:31.380- 22:31.760* :  No, no, no.
*22:31.760- 22:34.920* :  And some of the people who are led to have worked with you left this.
*22:34.940- 22:36.880* :  I don't know what is a state capture means.
*22:37.260- 22:38.960* :  Even that one I can tell you a lot.
*22:39.440- 22:40.760* :  It was all funny.
*22:42.020- 22:45.280* :  I'm asking if you heard people saying,
*22:45.900- 22:47.020* :  I am corrupt.
*22:47.760- 22:49.140* :  What did I do?
*22:49.940- 22:53.340* :  Do you have any liquefect about it?
*22:54.000- 22:55.000* :  There's still cases.
*22:55.260- 22:57.800* :  And next you'll be appearing before court again.
*22:58.860- 23:00.720* :  Am I guilty?
*23:02.340- 23:03.540* :  Well, I am not a judge.
*23:04.000- 23:12.080* :  But precisely, precisely, because we are insisting on the point where you want to hear me.
*23:12.080- 23:14.040* :  I don't want to hear you all the time.
*23:15.060- 23:21.060* :  I'm saying to you, I was removed before I finished my term.
*23:21.060- 23:26.740* :  And nothing was ever produced as evidence that this was a reason.
*23:27.380- 23:29.740* :  And as we go to another election,
*23:31.240- 23:34.220* :  consult Africa's trust you and what are you going to do differently?
*23:34.320- 23:35.460* :  Certainly, trust me.
*23:37.260- 23:38.540* :  Don't ask whether they can.
*23:38.540- 23:40.280* :  They are trusting me.
*23:40.740- 23:42.920* :  They trusted me when I was the president.
*23:44.200- 23:47.780* :  And you can ask any South African how the country was at the time.
*23:48.500- 23:49.660* :  They're trusting me now.
*23:49.660- 23:50.660* :  They're taking me back.
*23:51.120- 23:53.840* :  But what they say, that's where this is a man we trust.
*23:55.080- 23:58.660* :  The former president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, with my colleague Ann Saway.
*23:59.240- 24:03.740* :  Mexico is coming to the end of the most violent election campaign in the country's modern history.
*24:04.300- 24:08.300* :  Candidates and politicians have been murdered and threatened as powerful drugs cartels,
*24:08.520- 24:09.820* :  put their stamp on the election.
*24:10.380- 24:14.640* :  As we heard on yesterday's podcast, 12 bodies were discovered in the coastal city
*24:14.640- 24:18.020* :  of Acapulco from where our correspondent will grant reports.
*24:21.900- 24:24.580* :  Not a day passes in Acapulco without a murder.
*24:25.240- 24:29.600* :  On this occasion, yellow police tape has cordoned off a side street where a taxi driver
*24:29.600- 24:31.760* :  was gunned down while waiting for customers.
*24:32.900- 24:35.620* :  And in the most violent election in Mexico's history,
*24:35.620- 24:38.480* :  schools of candidates have also been in the firing line.
*24:39.140- 24:43.160* :  Even the leading candidate for city mayor was murdered as he ate dinner in a restaurant
*24:43.220- 24:43.800* :  one night.
*24:48.220- 24:52.300* :  Among the first to be killed on the campaign trail was Moisés Juarez Abarca,
*24:52.620- 24:56.840* :  a nationally renowned gay rights activist and local government candidate for the opposition
*24:56.840- 25:00.980* :  PRD party. His body was later found dumped in a mass grave.
*25:02.260- 25:06.960* :  Alongside my friend Moisés Abarca, I've been in political activism for more than 20 years.
*25:06.960- 25:11.200* :  This is by far the most violent campaign we've ever seen in the state of Guerrero.
*25:11.380- 25:15.180* :  Abarca's childhood friend, Cynthia Juarez, has replaced him on the ticket.
*25:15.180- 25:19.600* :  She knows full well the risks involved in running for office in his place.
*25:20.100- 25:24.880* :  Of course I'm afraid, I'm scared that one day I'll leave my house and never come home.
*25:25.460- 25:29.540* :  But this is the only way we have to raise our voice and to turn Acapulco back into the
*25:29.640- 25:30.800* :  hiding port at once.
*25:37.340- 25:40.620* :  Guerrero is now the most dangerous state in Mexico to seek votes.
*25:41.180- 25:46.380* :  Cynthia took me canvassing with Evodio Velasquez, a former mayor of Acapulco who's
*25:46.380- 25:51.240* :  endured threats his entire political life. While he was standing for Congress in this election,
*25:51.240- 25:56.840* :  armed men appeared at his home in an act of intimidation. He's since abandoned the race.
*25:59.180- 26:04.160* :  I'd rather be safe than sorry, he says. I don't want to become just another statistic.
*26:04.220- 26:08.260* :  I'd called on the authorities for protection, but it fell on deaf ears.
*26:08.700- 26:10.760* :  They've taken no action at all, he added.
*26:15.660- 26:18.620* :  The campaign violence has spanned the entire political spectrum.
*26:19.240- 26:23.440* :  Numerous candidates from the governing party Modena have been killed across the country.
*26:23.740- 26:32.000* :  Voters in Guerrero are likely to re-elect one of the most controversial figures in Mexican politics,
*26:32.000- 26:38.300* :  Senator Felix Salgado Macedonio. He was forced to drop out of the race for state governor in 2021
*26:38.300- 26:43.860* :  over rape and sexual assault allegations. He denied the charges and the case against him was
*26:43.860- 26:48.780* :  eventually dropped. Throughout the scandal he counted on the complete support of President
*26:48.780- 26:54.240* :  Andrés Manuel Lopez over the door. Even though official polls show 60% of Mexicans consider
*26:54.240- 27:00.920* :  their cities unsafe, Senator Salgado Macedonio denies Mr. Lopez over the security strategy has failed.
*27:02.580- 27:06.380* :  We have to move forward little by little until we pass by the entire country,
*27:07.020- 27:11.940* :  but we have another big problem, our neighbor to the north. For drugs to be bought and sold,
*27:12.360- 27:15.960* :  there must be supply and demand. So who's consuming the drugs?
*27:18.880- 27:23.940* :  As normal life begins to return to Acapulco Beach at the end of this particularly violent campaign,
*27:24.060- 27:29.440* :  voters will soon choose the men and women to lead Mexico in its seemingly endless drug war.
*27:30.420- 27:34.040* :  Political violence perpetrated by the drug cartels is nothing new here,
*27:34.700- 27:38.580* :  but the extent of the problem in this campaign has shocked even seasoned politicians.
*27:39.780- 27:44.880* :  Names are being removed from the ballot by the bullet, meaning some voters will be forced to choose
*27:44.880- 27:50.160* :  candidates who best serve the interests of organized crime, rather than the needs of their communities.
*27:52.140- 27:57.840* :  All grant in Acapulco. A man who is renovating his wine cellar in Austria has made an
*27:57.840- 28:03.160* :  extraordinary discovery, not a vintage red or white, but remains of prehistoric creatures.
*28:03.800- 28:06.720* :  Our correspondent in Vienna, Bethany Bell, takes up the story.
*28:07.200- 28:14.480* :  The wine maker, Andreas Pernestoffer, came across a number of huge bones buried deep in his wine cellar
*28:14.740- 28:20.160* :  in the village of Gobelsburg, West Vienna. He reported his fine to the authorities,
*28:20.760- 28:25.000* :  who identified them as the bones of at least three Stone Age mammoths.
*28:25.860- 28:30.540* :  Mr Pernestoffer said he was renovating his wine cellar when he made the discovery.
*28:34.640- 28:40.060* :  I thought it was just a piece of wood left by my grandfather, but then I dug it out a bit,
*28:40.480- 28:46.320* :  and I remembered that in the past my grandfather said he had found teeth, and then I immediately
*28:46.320- 28:54.020* :  thought it was a mammoth. Researchers from the Austrian Archaeological Institute say the bones
*28:54.020- 29:01.840* :  are estimated to be between 30,000 and 40,000 years old. They've called the find an archaeological
*29:01.840- 29:09.080* :  sensation. The discovery they said raises questions about how Stone Age people hunted mammoths.
*29:09.740- 29:13.540* :  They believe the mammoths could have died on the spot where the bones were found,
*29:13.580- 29:19.860* :  chased there by humans who may have set a trap for them. Once they're excavated,
*29:19.860- 29:24.000* :  the bones will be taken to the Vienna Museum of Natural History.
*29:25.140- 29:27.920* :  Now, have you ever had this response when going back to work?
*29:33.580- 29:37.360* :  That was Wednesday in the UK Parliament, where a politician got a standing ovation,
*29:37.740- 29:42.900* :  going back to work eight months after contracting sepsis, which led to him having his hands and
*29:42.900- 29:48.400* :  feet amputated. Sepsis is a rare but serious condition that develops when the body's immune
*29:48.400- 29:53.640* :  system overreacts to an infection and starts attacking its own tissues and organs.
*29:53.740- 29:59.680* :  And when Conservative MP Craig McKinley walked into the House of Commons members on all sides,
*29:59.700- 30:01.620* :  broke the rules and applauded him.
*30:09.400- 30:15.740* :  Thank you, Mr Speaker. This is an emotional day for me, and if you'd indulge me to say a few
*30:15.740- 30:20.920* :  thanks, because there are a few are due. And one of those, of course, and apology, actually,
*30:20.920- 30:26.800* :  that I've caused the breaking of so many rules today, clacking. I've got trainers on because my
*30:26.800- 30:32.320* :  shoes wouldn't go over the plastic feet, and my jacket wouldn't go over the bionic arm.
*30:32.760- 30:34.960* :  So apologies for that, but I want to give some thanks.
*30:35.800- 30:41.060* :  And first of all, the thanks to you, Mr Speaker, for being there for me, for coming to visit,
*30:41.820- 30:45.760* :  and I will tell everybody the little story. The rest of the hospital thought I must be
*30:45.760- 30:49.700* :  dreadfully ill, because they said that guys got the funeral direction and were ready.
*30:53.140- 30:57.520* :  And to my wife who's in the chamber, and my daughter and other family members, my father,
*30:57.800- 31:02.400* :  father-in-law, I'd like to thank my wife for being there every single day of those many months
*31:02.400- 31:06.900* :  in hospital, and she could only do that because of the support of family behind her.
*31:07.640- 31:11.780* :  And to explain the joke, the Speaker of the House of Commons wears black robes in the chamber,
*31:12.160- 31:13.600* :  a bit like a funeral director.
*31:16.200- 31:19.920* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
