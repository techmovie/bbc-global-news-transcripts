*01:19.020- 01:21.600* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.320- 01:28.400* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 9th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:29.000- 01:34.680* :  Human Rights Watch says the paramilitary rapid support forces in Sudan may have committed genocide
*01:34.680- 01:40.700* :  in West Dalfour. A former Saudi intelligence officer tells the BBC that Saudi Arabia has
*01:40.700- 01:47.680* :  permitted the use of lethal force to clear land for a futuristic desert city. And Japan is to start
*01:47.680- 01:52.380* :  hunting fin whales whose conservation status is described as vulnerable.
*01:55.100- 02:01.080* :  Also in this podcast, can an amputee become an astronaut? One man is training exactly for that.
*02:01.840- 02:08.060* :  In the capsule, the geolote is going straight down the line of my femur, so pushing the socket
*02:08.060- 02:14.900* :  onto my residual limb. All that and under the hammer, Shirley Bass's glittering collection of jules.
*02:18.460- 02:24.100* :  But first, in conflicts, the people who often suffer most are not the armed factions,
*02:24.100- 02:30.480* :  but the civilians stuck in the middle. Nowhere is that more true than in West Dalfour in Sudan.
*02:31.340- 02:35.800* :  For more than two decades, the Masalid people there, a Black African ethnic group,
*02:36.180- 02:41.260* :  have been targeted by Arab factions. Now there are warnings from human rights watch
*02:41.260- 02:46.860* :  that the attacks may amount to genocide. The charges against the rapid support forces
*02:46.860- 02:51.800* :  and their allied militias, which have been involved in a civil war against the government.
*02:51.820- 02:58.640* :  The report focuses on the West Dalfour city of El Janina, where it says thousands of civilians
*02:58.640- 03:03.440* :  were killed last year. Here's Jean-Baptiste Gallupin from Human Rights Watch,
*03:03.440- 03:08.600* :  describing one of the worst incidents. The column came under attack early in the morning
*03:08.600- 03:16.300* :  on 150 by the RSF and allied militias, who up and fire on the crowd and then deliberately
*03:16.340- 03:21.580* :  killed large numbers of civilians. The accounts we heard were horrific, you know,
*03:22.140- 03:26.940* :  hundreds of people trying to swim across the river, mini-drowning, and still, you know,
*03:26.940- 03:29.900* :  coming under attack, being shot at by the RSF and militias.
*03:30.260- 03:34.380* :  Our Africa correspondent, Barbara Pledasha, tell me more about lost years attacks.
*03:34.460- 03:40.160* :  The RSF clashed with the Sudanese military in El Janina on April 24th,
*03:40.540- 03:45.560* :  and then it started to attack these majority Masalid neighborhoods, which were initially defended
*03:45.560- 03:51.400* :  by Masalid armed groups. But even after that, Human Rights Watch says the RSF continued to
*03:51.400- 03:57.520* :  systematically target unarmed civilians. And then the violence culminated in this large scale massacre
*03:57.520- 04:03.240* :  on the 15th of June. So this was after the Masalid governor had been killed. And there were
*04:03.240- 04:10.300* :  thousands of people who fled in this kilometer's long convoy, and the allegation is that the RSF
*04:10.300- 04:15.400* :  and the militias pursued, rounded them up, shot them, men, women, and children, and so on.
*04:15.540- 04:19.260* :  Barbara, there have been repeated attacks against the Masalid and other groups
*04:19.920- 04:25.540* :  in Darfur over more than 20 years, and there have been repeated allegations of genocide,
*04:25.540- 04:31.280* :  haven't there, but nothing perhaps has changed. Well, the main allegations of genocide came
*04:31.280- 04:37.180* :  after the ethnic violence around 20 years ago, and then the UN put forward a peacekeeping force,
*04:37.180- 04:43.100* :  which did have some impact in protecting civilians. But that was withdrawn a number of years ago,
*04:43.100- 04:49.700* :  and the attacks started to happen periodically after that. But this attack on Al Janina,
*04:50.260- 04:55.440* :  which Human Rights documents, talks about what it says is very systematic targeting.
*04:55.500- 05:01.520* :  It concludes that the RSF and its allies are guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes,
*05:01.520- 05:06.780* :  which it says were committed in the context of an ethnic cleansing campaign. And then it goes
*05:06.780- 05:11.380* :  further and says that ethnic cleansing campaign might constitute genocide if there was an
*05:11.380- 05:18.100* :  intention with these attacks to actually clear out Al Janina to actually destroy that community
*05:18.100- 05:23.500* :  of Masalids, at least in West Darfur, that would indicate genocide, so it calls on the international
*05:23.500- 05:28.520* :  community to investigate the facts to see whether that intent that would underline a charge of
*05:28.520- 05:35.080* :  genocide exists. Are you say that might happen? Could that be the impact of this report? Some process
*05:35.080- 05:40.320* :  being started. Well, there is a process that has been started, so the international criminal court
*05:40.320- 05:46.260* :  had been looking at the allegations of genocide from the ethnic violence 20 years ago, and it was
*05:46.260- 05:52.100* :  reactivated to investigate what was happening in Darfur, including in Al Janina. And the prosecutor
*05:52.100- 05:58.300* :  for the ICC has told the Security Council that there are strong grounds to believe that both the
*05:58.300- 06:05.380* :  Army and the RSF are committing what he calls Rome Statute Crimes in Darfur. Now, Rome Statute Crimes
*06:05.960- 06:11.360* :  are war crimes. They also include genocide, but he did not specifically mention genocide. I'm
*06:11.360- 06:16.260* :  sure that Human Rights March would hope that this report would provide evidence and material for
*06:16.260- 06:24.040* :  the ICC prosecutor's case. Barbara Plutasha. Historically, Sierra Leone has had strong relations with
*06:24.160- 06:29.320* :  Western countries, including the UK. But now the foreign minister there, Timothy Musacaba,
*06:29.320- 06:34.960* :  has announced that Russia will reopen its embassy in the capital free-town after more than three
*06:34.960- 06:40.140* :  decades. The move is expected before the end of the year. Since several countries in the region,
*06:40.140- 06:45.560* :  Niger, Marley and Burkina Faso are now moving towards Moscow. The BBC's James Coppinole
*06:45.560- 06:49.240* :  asked Mr. Caba if this represented a shift in foreign policy.
*06:49.860- 06:56.680* :  Now, Sierra Leone is still one of the, the UK remains one of the strongest allies of Sierra Leone.
*06:57.040- 07:02.460* :  It's not a shift in foreign policy, rather we expand in our reach to every corner of the world,
*07:02.940- 07:08.200* :  given the geopolitical context of the world. And bearing in mind that Sierra Leone today plays
*07:08.920- 07:14.860* :  a key leadership position in the UN Security Council. It makes Sierra Leone a very attractive country.
*07:15.340- 07:20.720* :  Our foreign policy is without exclusion. But we haven't shifted and the UK and the West
*07:20.720- 07:26.540* :  remain a reliable, long-standing partner of the people and government of Sierra Leone.
*07:26.680- 07:30.600* :  Because it says, of course, there are other divided world right now, not least because of
*07:30.600- 07:35.720* :  Russia's invasion of Ukraine. You mentioned there Sierra Leone's role on the Security Council for
*07:35.720- 07:41.980* :  the next couple of years, a non-permanent member. How do you then intend to navigate that
*07:42.060- 07:46.960* :  very divided international context? Well, I tell you what. I think Africa was caught up in the
*07:46.960- 07:53.660* :  crux of the Cold War in today's multiple-a-world, of a rather transactional international
*07:53.660- 07:59.780* :  relation. I think Africa is trying to position itself in such a way that we are not brought into
*07:59.780- 08:06.160* :  in today's situation of what happened during the Cold War. What we are trying to do basically
*08:06.160- 08:11.200* :  is to ensure that we seek our continent's interests, particularly Sierra Leone.
*08:11.580- 08:16.700* :  Unlike, you know, you may mention of countries like Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, Sierra Leone is
*08:16.700- 08:23.560* :  a very peaceful democratic country in view of its trajectory from conflict to peace and its
*08:23.600- 08:30.680* :  steadfast progression in democratic consolidation. And so rather than being at the losing end of what
*08:31.800- 08:37.340* :  is more like a multiple-a-world, we're trying to find our own space to the benefit of the people
*08:37.340- 08:41.960* :  of Sierra Leone. In terms of that Russian connection there, I think you studied in Russia. You speak
*08:41.960- 08:47.320* :  Russian. That's correct. You have that personal tire, I suppose. What are you looking for from
*08:47.320- 08:52.580* :  Russia to get your voice heard in Moscow, of course? But are we talking about Russian investments
*08:52.580- 08:56.040* :  here in Sierra Leone? Are we talking about, we mentioned some of your neighbours bringing Russian
*08:56.040- 09:00.260* :  military advice, is military presence? Is that something you would consider?
*09:00.480- 09:05.580* :  It is worth noting that Sierra Leone is a former British colony, and I studied in English as well.
*09:05.580- 09:12.100* :  So there is no delitious interest or advantage there. It's the fact that Sierra Leone's foreign
*09:12.100- 09:18.040* :  policy is one that is looking for benefit, mutual respect, common interest and shared values.
*09:18.520- 09:24.920* :  Yes, the Russian Federation and Sierra Leone have had over 60 years of bilateral relations. I think
*09:25.020- 09:30.360* :  what we want to do is to deepen this relation, and also be in mind that the Russian Federation is
*09:30.360- 09:35.280* :  one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, so it is inevitable that we have to deal
*09:35.280- 09:39.900* :  with the Russian Federation. I'm very proud that I'm a product of Russia. I have the opportunity
*09:39.900- 09:45.820* :  of studying there, so I have a contextual understanding of the relationship between Sierra Leone and Russia,
*09:45.820- 09:50.920* :  but that does not obviate Sierra Leone's traditional and very strong relationship with
*09:50.920- 09:55.420* :  our Western allies. Sure, but in concrete terms, investment, is that something you're looking
*09:55.420- 10:00.940* :  for from Russia? Absolutely, we're looking for investment. The President has said five game
*10:00.940- 10:07.960* :  changes, as he said, strategy for economic development, and so we're looking for those who can
*10:07.960- 10:13.880* :  align with the President agenda to develop agriculture and ensure that Sierra Leone is food
*10:13.880- 10:19.520* :  sufficient and ensures that technology becomes part of the daily activities of Sierra Leoneans
*10:19.760- 10:25.140* :  for us to compete in this technological age, and we also look for partners that will help create
*10:25.140- 10:29.740* :  opportunities for Sierra Leoneans, especially the youth of our country. Timothy Nusa Kaba,
*10:29.740- 10:35.020* :  talking to my colleague, James Coppano. Saudi Arabia's plan to build a brand new city by the Red
*10:35.020- 10:40.600* :  Sea was never going to be simple, costing half a trillion dollars, Neon, as it's called,
*10:41.120- 10:45.940* :  is part of the country's attempt to change its economy and its image. Tourism will be central.
*10:45.940- 10:51.180* :  Visitors might be allowed to drink alcohol, but there have always been question marks. Was
*10:51.180- 10:56.380* :  the project financially viable? Would tourists want to visit? And there was also the concern
*10:56.380- 11:01.780* :  about the residents already living on the site where Neon is being built most in small villages.
*11:01.780- 11:07.940* :  It turns out that Saudi police were told they could use lethal force to evict these locals.
*11:08.540- 11:13.020* :  That's according to a former intelligence officer as the BBC's Merlin Thomas reports.
*11:16.160- 11:21.420* :  Neon, Saudi Arabia's plan plan to transform the country and its image.
*11:22.380- 11:26.100* :  This promotional video shows a project, almost the size of Belgium.
*11:27.040- 11:31.060* :  It's being built by companies from all over the world, more than a dozen of from the UK,
*11:31.060- 11:35.460* :  including McLaren Racing and Engineering and Design firms, Arab and Atkins.
*11:35.460- 11:41.800* :  At its heart is the line, a city carved from the desert in visage to be a hundred miles straight
*11:41.800- 11:48.440* :  line. But only one and a half miles we reportedly built by 2030. Neon's driving force is the
*11:48.440- 11:53.400* :  country's leader Muhammad bin Salman. He spoke about his vision for the city in a documentary
*11:53.400- 11:58.920* :  for the Discovery Channel. So since we have empty place and we want to have a place for 10 million
*11:58.920- 12:06.460* :  people, then let's think from scratch. But it wasn't empty. Near this new city, thousands of people
*12:06.460- 12:12.500* :  lived in villages who for years objected to being moved. But still, the project went on.
*12:15.180- 12:19.140* :  A former Saudi intelligence officer told us he was given orders to clear one of the villages
*12:19.140- 12:25.480* :  near Neon in 2020. He said security forces were permitted to kill those who refused eviction.
*12:26.860- 12:31.640* :  Karnau Rabahal Anzi has been living in fear since he went into exile in the UK last year.
*12:32.580- 12:37.400* :  He claims he was offered four million pounds by the Saudi regime in exchange for his silence,
*12:38.480- 12:48.060* :  but he refused. The order said whoever continues to resist should be killed. So it licensed
*12:48.060- 12:54.500* :  the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home. This was very harsh and I was shocked
*12:54.500- 13:00.680* :  by it. The orders were never this brutal, like using lethal force against peaceful activists.
*13:00.680- 13:07.120* :  He says he dodged the mission which went ahead without him. One man Abdul Rahim al-Hawati was shot
*13:07.120- 13:13.180* :  dead by Saudi forces after he refused to leave his home. The Saudi government says he was an
*13:13.180- 13:19.420* :  armed terrorist who opened fire on security forces. But the UN and human rights groups say he was
*13:19.420- 13:28.040* :  killed for refusing eviction. Neon's grand plan also includes Tregina, a ski resort built in the
*13:28.040- 13:34.700* :  desert. And he worth became CEO shortly after the shooting. He repeatedly asked about the killing
*13:34.700- 13:42.160* :  of Abdul Rahim al-Hawati. He resigned after less than a year. It was clearly unnecessary. It was
*13:42.160- 13:49.780* :  clearly murder. You don't accelerate human progress at the detriment of other humans. You don't
*13:49.980- 13:56.200* :  step on their throats with your boot heels so you can advance. That's not human progress.
*13:56.980- 14:01.080* :  40 people from three villages have been detained after objecting to the evictions
*14:01.080- 14:06.360* :  according to the human rights group al-Hawati. It says five villages are on death row
*14:06.360- 14:12.120* :  facing terrorism charges. The Saudi government and Neon didn't respond to our questions about
*14:12.120- 14:18.620* :  their cases. We looked at satellite images of villages where they lived. Homes, schools,
*14:18.620- 14:24.840* :  hospitals have been wiped off the map. At least a dozen UK companies are involved in Neon.
*14:25.340- 14:30.220* :  Until recently, solar water was one of them. They walked away from a £100 million contract
*14:30.220- 14:36.400* :  with Neon. In an exclusive interview, their boss, Malcolm Orr, told us he began to feel the entire
*14:36.400- 14:40.920* :  project was destructive for both the local environment and the people who lived there.
*14:41.700- 14:46.660* :  He says companies involved in the project should do more. If they're there and there's things
*14:46.660- 14:52.460* :  that are happening, they can't ignore these things. Do something about it. We put our findings to
*14:52.460- 14:56.400* :  some of the British companies involved in the project. Engineering and design firms,
*14:56.400- 15:01.600* :  Atkins and Arup and racing company McLaren told us they take human rights concerns seriously
*15:02.180- 15:05.880* :  and look at the broader context of projects and said any concerns must be reported.
*15:06.800- 15:11.960* :  Mohamed bin Salman wants Neon to be his legacy, a shining jewel in the desert.
*15:12.480- 15:17.800* :  But critics say the project has crossed some southies their freedom and their lives.
*15:18.480- 15:24.060* :  Merlin Thomas. Japan is just one of a handful of nations where whale hunting is still allowed.
*15:24.060- 15:29.040* :  But despite the fact that fewer and fewer people there eat whale meat, the government has
*15:29.040- 15:34.760* :  just announced that it's expanding hunting to another species. Asia Pacific editor Michael
*15:34.760- 15:40.940* :  Bristow told me more about the move. Three species at the moment are allowed to be hunted by Japanese
*15:40.940- 15:46.740* :  vessels. They've increased that to four. Importantly, the fourth species is a thin whale.
*15:47.120- 15:53.560* :  A thin whale is far larger than the ones they've already been hunting down, twice as large,
*15:53.920- 15:59.220* :  least twice as large. So that's what they've announced. It can't be a coincidence. I don't think
*15:59.220- 16:06.820* :  that just a few weeks ago, a seafood company in Japan launched a new really large whale in
*16:06.820- 16:13.860* :  ship. And so the government's obviously trying to kind of push whale in. And despite the fact
*16:13.860- 16:20.420* :  it's been abandoned, as you indicated there by most countries, Japan still believes that it's a part
*16:20.420- 16:26.920* :  of its culture, it's its food culture, and it's certainly promoting whaling.
*16:27.520- 16:31.200* :  I know around the world there's a lot of opposition to whale hunting, but what about in Japan?
*16:31.200- 16:35.620* :  How's it like to be received there? Well, it's a mix really because of course,
*16:35.640- 16:42.180* :  a really vocal lobby, the fishing or groups of fishermen and whalers, and peel to tradition
*16:42.220- 16:46.760* :  and a traditional way of life. So that's a strong lobby. Of course, we are environmentalists as
*16:46.760- 16:52.880* :  well, not just in Japan, but outside Japan. Japan's been whaling, actually, for a good few years.
*16:52.880- 16:58.800* :  Initially, it got round restrictions on whaling by saying it was doing it for scientific purposes.
*16:58.800- 17:04.740* :  Then five years ago, it said it was resuming commercial whaling. And last year it hunted down
*17:04.740- 17:11.160* :  about 300 whales. This now is definitely an expansion. And environmental groups will certainly be
*17:11.160- 17:15.680* :  critical of this. Essentially, they'll be thinking as well, particularly with this new vessel that
*17:15.920- 17:22.800* :  Japan perhaps wants to expand whaling beyond its own waters to kind of other areas previously
*17:22.800- 17:28.340* :  used to hunt in the Antarctic ocean. And environmentalists will be worrying that they're going to return
*17:28.340- 17:36.020* :  there. Michael Brister. Still to come on this podcast, how a former employee of spirit
*17:36.020- 17:42.640* :  aerosystems, which supplies Boeing with components for the 737 MAX, has raised the alarm saying

*19:07.560- 19:12.680* :  It is victory day in Russia, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War
*19:12.680- 19:17.100* :  and commemorates the millions of Soviet citizens who died in the conflict.
*19:17.700- 19:22.080* :  President Putin told members of the armed forces and the public who'd gathered in Moscow that
*19:22.080- 19:27.760* :  Russia was living through a difficult time. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg was in the
*19:27.760- 19:33.940* :  center of the capital as the main parade took place. Thousands of military personnel or the
*19:33.940- 19:42.140* :  9000 people marching across Red Square in the snow. I say big parade, but this parade is actually
*19:42.140- 19:47.720* :  not quite as big as it has been in previous years before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*19:48.440- 19:53.180* :  Now in Russia under that of a food in victory has become pretty much the main
*19:53.180- 19:59.560* :  secular national holiday. A data remember the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany, but also the
*19:59.560- 20:05.860* :  enormous cost of victory that 27 million Soviet citizens who were killed in what's
*20:05.860- 20:12.580* :  preferred to hear as the great patriotic war. So here comes the hardware, the victory
*20:12.580- 20:18.520* :  labor age of Russia is an opportunity to project Russian power. Now I mentioned the Second World
*20:18.860- 20:24.720* :  War. Russia today isn't just remembering the past, it's weaponizing it to try to justify
*20:24.720- 20:30.520* :  the present. So the authorities want the Russian public to view the war in Ukraine very much
*20:30.880- 20:36.140* :  as a continuation of the Second World War. They want Russians to believe that once again
*20:36.140- 20:43.780* :  external forces are trying to destroy Russia. Nazi Germany then Ukraine and the West today.
*20:43.820- 20:48.560* :  While in reality two years ago it was Russia with attacked Ukraine,
*20:48.560- 20:55.240* :  launching a full-scale invasion of its labor from Vladimir Putin today, a warning to the West.
*20:57.460- 21:04.040* :  Russia will do everything to avoid a global confrontation, but at the same time you will not
*21:04.040- 21:10.380* :  allow anyone to threaten us. Our strategic forces are always on combat alert.
*21:11.520- 21:18.380* :  So a military fly past and the Russian trickler in the sky brings this parade to an end,
*21:19.120- 21:25.440* :  but there is no end in sight to the war in Ukraine nor to the tension between Russia and the West.
*21:25.840- 21:31.920* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. By-do is China's big search engine and right now it's dealing with a
*21:31.920- 21:38.000* :  public relations headache. That's after its own PR boss made some videos on social media that
*21:38.000- 21:42.220* :  really struck a nerve. Here's our Asia Business Correspondent, Mariko Oy.
*21:42.700- 21:48.660* :  Her name is Chujing and she basically released some video clips on TikTok's Chinese version
*21:48.660- 21:55.280* :  Cole Joyun portraying herself as a tough as Nell's manager and get this. She said that she
*21:55.280- 22:01.300* :  has no responsibility for her staff's personal well-being. She also said that she's so devoted to
*22:01.300- 22:06.400* :  the company that she doesn't know what grade her son is in. That's cool. And she also said that
*22:06.400- 22:12.380* :  she has the power to make sure anyone who complains about her won't ever find a job in the industry.
*22:12.380- 22:18.540* :  So as you can imagine it caused a huge controversy and outcry and many people have started coming
*22:18.540- 22:24.500* :  out talking about how you know she often emails you at 1 a.m. making your work over the weekend and
*22:24.500- 22:31.060* :  so on. So really a public relations nightmare. Mariko Oy. It's been a very difficult year for
*22:31.060- 22:38.060* :  the playmaker Boeing in January, a section of door blew out from one of its 737 Max jets
*22:38.060- 22:45.100* :  at nearly 5,000 meters. The whole fleet was temporarily grounded. Now a former employee of
*22:45.100- 22:51.000* :  Spirit Aero Systems, that's a company which supplies Boeing with components for the 737 Max,
*22:51.000- 22:57.100* :  has raised the alarm by claiming that some major parts left its factory with serious defects.
*22:58.040- 23:03.000* :  Here's Santiago Parade speaking to our international business correspondent Theo Leggett.
*23:03.300- 23:09.360* :  Anywhere from 50 to 100 to 100? You were regularly finding more than 100 faults on a plane
*23:09.360- 23:15.420* :  that was being shipped. And that's because I just respect certain areas. So in total
*23:15.420- 23:19.720* :  totality with all the inspectors, if you total them out, yeah, you'll be over the hundreds.
*23:20.060- 23:24.220* :  Now you were picking up on these faults, you were highlighting them, you were flagging them up
*23:24.220- 23:28.900* :  to be repaired. What kind of response did you get from your managers? Did they support you?
*23:29.340- 23:35.100* :  My managers, when always there, the production managers always made a fuss about why I was
*23:35.100- 23:41.460* :  finding it, why I was looking at it, and they made a big fuss about everything that I ever found.
*23:42.400- 23:48.000* :  Theo Leggett told me more about the issue. As you heard there, he became quite accustomed to
*23:48.760- 23:53.480* :  finding large numbers of faults at the end of the production line. Now that really shouldn't
*23:53.480- 23:59.320* :  happen, you know, things should be rectified as the process goes on. But also I asked him whether
*23:59.320- 24:06.500* :  any of these faults were still on planes when they were sent to Boeing in Washington. And he said,
*24:06.500- 24:13.360* :  yes, serious defects were finding their way through and we're ending up in Boeing's factory. Now you
*24:13.360- 24:18.720* :  could say Boeing would be quite capable of remedying those problems itself, but don't forget the
*24:18.720- 24:24.320* :  Boeing workers were under a great deal of time pressure, were under stress as well. So if you have
*24:24.320- 24:30.000* :  faulty products arriving in a factory, there's no guarantee that they'll be noticed or rectified. So
*24:30.460- 24:35.360* :  he also said that records weren't being kept as they should. And that when he raised this point,
*24:35.880- 24:41.200* :  he was retaliated against. At one point, he was removed from a leadership role. He was
*24:41.640- 24:46.020* :  made to work in a back office. And at that point, he actually wrote to the chief executive of the
*24:46.020- 24:51.180* :  company saying, I'm my wit's end, I don't know what to do. And these are planes that people will fly
*24:51.180- 24:56.740* :  in, you know, it's a risky business. And Theo, what's been the reaction now from the company spirit
*24:56.740- 25:02.620* :  and from Boeing? Now, spirit says he's strongly disagrees with all of his allegations and will defend
*25:02.620- 25:09.080* :  itself vigorously. It also says it'll defend that lawsuit vigorously. Boeing, which obviously is
*25:09.080- 25:14.740* :  the customer here, you know, spirit is its main supplier, hasn't commented. But inside is there,
*25:14.740- 25:19.800* :  so it's working hard behind the scenes to help spirit resolve these issues that it's had some
*25:19.800- 25:24.900* :  success there that the number of faults being shipped from the Wichita plant to Washington has
*25:24.900- 25:30.420* :  been reduced by 80%. Both of them are under intense scrutiny at the moment from the Federal
*25:30.420- 25:35.760* :  Aviation Administration in the United States to clean up their quality control procedures. And
*25:35.760- 25:41.140* :  that largely stems from an incident earlier this year when a brand new 737 Max flying out of
*25:41.140- 25:46.600* :  Portland, in Oregon, lost a door panel in the early stages of flight. And that left a gaping
*25:46.600- 25:51.160* :  hole in the plane. Nobody was hurt, but obviously it could have been a lot worse. Theo Lake it.
*25:51.880- 25:56.620* :  And what's the best way to train up an amputee astronaut for the challenges of space?
*25:57.400- 26:03.040* :  John McFall, a former Paralympian, is taking part in the world's first study. To look at the
*26:03.040- 26:07.860* :  difficulties, people with physical disabilities could face going into space and how to overcome them.
*26:08.200- 26:12.840* :  Our science editor Rebecca Morrell has visited the team from the European Space Agency
*26:12.840- 26:19.380* :  to find out how he's getting on. It's a key test for a trainee astronaut.
*26:19.380- 26:25.420* :  Any questions? No questions. But it's not for the faint-hearted or the claustrophobic.
*26:29.260- 26:34.140* :  With a slam of the door, John McFall is enclosed in a coffin-sized metal box.
*26:35.040- 26:38.020* :  Two, one, ignition and lift off.
*26:40.900- 26:46.720* :  John is taking a spin in a giant centrifuge. He's being whizzed round and round at increasing speed
*26:46.720- 26:52.640* :  to mimic the extreme gravitational forces he'd experienced taking off in a rocket and coming back
*26:52.640- 26:58.240* :  down again. The faster it spins, the higher the G load is that you experience and today we're going
*26:58.240- 27:03.760* :  to be going up to about six genes, so six times the force of gravity. It's designed to replicate
*27:03.760- 27:08.080* :  what it would be like during reentry into the atmosphere in a Soyuz capsule.
*27:09.000- 27:13.680* :  John's working with the European Space Agency to see if someone with a physical disability can
*27:13.680- 27:19.260* :  go to space. He's an amputee. He lost the lower part of his right leg in a motorcycle accident
*27:19.260- 27:24.660* :  when he was 19. Usually he wears a prosthesis, but for the centrifuge he's taken it off.
*27:25.100- 27:31.380* :  It's a chance to see how the test affects his upper leg. In the capsule, the G load is going straight
*27:31.380- 27:38.320* :  down the line of my femur, so pushing the socket onto my residual limb. It's going to be a really
*27:38.320- 27:44.380* :  good indication to see if it causes any significant discomfort or if I have any problems with it.
*27:45.580- 27:50.520* :  I'm in the control centre and there's a bank of screens here and you can see John in one of the
*27:50.520- 27:56.100* :  mini's capsule. He's been smiling, so he looks okay so far. The team can communicate with him,
*27:56.480- 28:01.040* :  they're also monitoring his health, they're checking to see if there are any effects on his
*28:01.180- 28:06.280* :  hearts, on his oxygen levels so they can see exactly how his body is reacting.
*28:08.760- 28:14.020* :  So actually it was for us the first time that we actually had an amputee in the centrifuge.
*28:14.380- 28:19.820* :  Maybrit Kipers is a flight surgeon for the European Space Agency. They're basically lying on
*28:19.820- 28:25.880* :  their back and so this influences the blood flow also in the leg and we were also curious to see
*28:25.880- 28:32.220* :  how that would affect him, but it went really well. It's the first time any space agency has
*28:32.220- 28:37.280* :  carried out a project like this. Frank Tavina, who's in charge of the ESA's astronaut centre,
*28:37.520- 28:43.340* :  says he wants to open up space. We think this is a great opportunity because we have so many great
*28:43.340- 28:50.620* :  talents, people that have a disability like we see John, but with so much talent, so much
*28:50.620- 28:58.060* :  capabilities and why should we not try to also harvest this talent and I would really love to see
*28:58.060- 29:05.020* :  a John flight to space. John's now about halfway through his feasibility study,
*29:05.020- 29:10.800* :  he's not guaranteed a mission, but everything is progressing well so far, including this
*29:10.980- 29:12.340* :  disinist inducing test.
*29:33.900- 29:38.940* :  That report was by Rebecca Morrell, and finally as the song goes, Diamonds are forever,
*29:38.940- 29:44.400* :  at least, until he decided to sell them. The woman who made the song famous, the veteran
*29:44.400- 29:49.620* :  British singer Shirley Bassie is doing just that. Shirley Bassie is auctioning off some of her
*29:49.620- 29:56.060* :  dazzling jewelry collection and the precious pieces are estimated to be worth nearly $750,000.
*29:56.920- 29:58.060* :  David Lewis has the story.
*30:13.180- 30:19.100* :  It's an eye-catching collection of bling up for fans with pockets as deep as their love of
*30:19.100- 30:25.140* :  precious gemstones. Dame Shirley's lots include a diamond necklace expected to fetch upwards of
*30:25.140- 30:30.740* :  $300,000. There are emerald earrings she wore for a royal performance in front of the late
*30:30.740- 30:36.340* :  Queen Elizabeth, also up for the highest bidder. There's an aqua marine and sapphire gem set,
*30:36.340- 30:42.380* :  as well as a quarter of a million dollar Cartier diamond and gold set, not at all bad.
*30:42.380- 30:49.020* :  And there's more, a gift from Elton John, the 1960s vintage heart-shaped ring covered in diamonds,
*30:49.020- 30:55.040* :  was given to her after she sang at one of his aides' garner evenings. Dame Shirley said she'd
*30:55.040- 31:00.980* :  worn the piece many times. The 87-year-old is perhaps most famed for singing the title track of the
*31:00.980- 31:07.900* :  1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. She took it on as she said the lyrics rang true to
*31:07.900- 31:13.520* :  her. Collecting jewelry for me is like collecting memories and this collection is full of them,
*31:13.520- 31:19.400* :  she said. All the pieces are meaningful and have a story to tell, whether I bought them for myself
*31:19.400- 31:24.360* :  or they were gifted to me. So why is the star getting rid of all the jewels and sparkle?
*31:24.360- 31:30.040* :  It's all to support her charitable causes. The precious goods are going on display in London this
*31:30.040- 31:37.780* :  month before moving to Paris for auction this October. David Lewis reporting.
*31:40.300- 31:44.200* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.

*31:55.440- 32:01.040* :  This edition was mixed by Sid Dundin. The producer was Oliver Burlow. The editor is Karen
*32:01.040- 32:03.500* :  Martin. I'm Nick Mars and until next time, goodbye.
*32:12.100- 32:18.440* :  The mountains are what keeps me motivated in life. It's where we get to ask ourselves who we are
*32:18.440- 32:24.660* :  and who we want to become. At the turn of this century, five mountaineers set out on individual
*32:24.660- 32:31.520* :  missions to become the first woman to scale all 14 of the world's 8,000ers. 14 mountains
*32:31.520- 32:37.920* :  all above 8,000 meters. It was about pitting themselves against nature rather than each other.
*32:38.220- 32:41.860* :  They knew only one of them would succeed, but whether they liked it or not,
*32:41.860- 32:46.720* :  it would come to be seen as a race. Five women vying against each other.
*32:46.860- 32:53.160* :  The media's needed to find some competition and they find it. A race with deadly consequences.
*32:53.620- 32:56.400* :  We are just not designed to live in these environments.
*32:56.400- 33:00.000* :  Getting down alive was my only goal in that situation.
