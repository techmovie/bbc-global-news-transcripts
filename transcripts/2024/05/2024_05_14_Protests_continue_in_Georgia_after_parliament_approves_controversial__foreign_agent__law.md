*01:29.580- 01:33.960* :  Riot Police confront protesters in Georgia after Parliament passes a foreign influence
*01:33.960- 01:36.980* :  law that opponents feel will be used to stifle dissent.

*01:41.800- 01:44.840* :  Joe Biden accuses China of cheating, not competing,

*02:17.520- 02:19.500* :  Let's begin this podcast in Georgia.
*02:25.360- 02:29.220* :  Being clashes between Riot Police and thousands of protesters in the capital to
*02:29.220- 02:32.980* :  BLEC, after Parliament voted through a controversial bill which will force
*02:32.980- 02:37.680* :  civil society and media organisations to register if they receive foreign funding.
*02:38.220- 02:41.440* :  Critics are likening the bill to legislation in neighbouring Russia
*02:41.780- 02:45.040* :  used to stifle dissent and silence criticism of the Kremlin.
*02:45.740- 02:47.940* :  Thousands of protesters in the capital to BLEC
*02:47.940- 02:49.700* :  chanted no to the Russian law.
*02:49.700- 02:53.500* :  The government claims it's necessary to maintain Georgian sovereignty.
*02:53.900- 02:55.440* :  Randometry is into BLEC.
*02:55.680- 02:58.040* :  It's been a dramatic day here in BLEC.
*02:58.040- 03:02.500* :  Protesters clashed with the police after more than three weeks of demonstrations.
*03:03.160- 03:06.080* :  At its heart is a fight over Georgia's future.
*03:06.600- 03:10.820* :  One that takes it to Europe or one that takes it back to Russia.
*03:13.580- 03:15.480* :  They marched in with a warning.
*03:16.640- 03:21.220* :  Against the protesters who have been demonstrating outside Parliament for weeks.
*03:22.620- 03:28.620* :  Protesters stood defiantly refusing to move away and then violence.
*03:32.320- 03:38.380* :  All in the name of a contentious law which protesters fear will mark the end of Georgia's democracy.
*03:42.900- 03:44.640* :  They're moving more intensely.
*03:48.140- 03:49.880* :  And the protesters are beginning to boo.
*03:52.960- 03:54.920* :  They've been pushed away from this square.
*03:55.820- 03:56.980* :  We will be in the EU.
*03:57.280- 03:58.360* :  We will be in the EU.
*03:58.560- 03:59.620* :  Freedom to the Georgian.
*04:00.180- 04:03.020* :  Georgian people are standing for their rights to make a decision
*04:03.420- 04:04.900* :  which is to be against this law.
*04:05.220- 04:06.140* :  We do not wish it.
*04:06.280- 04:09.740* :  It is dragging us back into the same hole that we finally crawled out of.
*04:11.220- 04:18.040* :  A similar foreign-agents law exists in Russia used there to crack down on government's critics.
*04:19.040- 04:22.420* :  Georgians worry the same thing might happen here.
*04:31.300- 04:37.800* :  Earlier MPs from the governing party passed the law after a debate turned into a brawl.
*04:40.040- 04:45.720* :  Authorities defended the bill saying it would help protect Georgia from foreign interference.
*04:47.020- 04:51.820* :  Critics suspect the government is trying to protect the interests of one man,
*04:52.360- 04:56.560* :  Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia.
*04:58.300- 05:04.940* :  These mass protests have been driven by Georgia's youth, standing up to defend the national dream
*05:05.420- 05:06.840* :  over future in Europe.
*05:06.840- 05:14.020* :  It is past 1 a.m. here, but many of the protesters still remain out in the streets.
*05:14.520- 05:18.040* :  Earlier visiting European officials addressed the demonstrators,
*05:18.540- 05:21.220* :  and they said that the government refused to meet them,
*05:21.520- 05:26.460* :  but they expressed support to the Georgian youth who are standing there here
*05:26.720- 05:28.720* :  and fighting for their European future.
*05:29.300- 05:33.000* :  Rendometrie in Tbilisi, and for all the background on what's happening in Georgia,
*05:33.000- 05:38.560* :  listen to the latest edition of the Global Story podcast, which looks closely at the mass protests
*05:38.560- 05:41.460* :  as well as the controversial law which sparked them.
*05:41.460- 05:45.180* :  Just look for the Global Story, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*05:46.020- 05:47.760* :  Next to Ukraine, you're not alone.
*05:47.760- 05:51.640* :  That was the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's message to Ukraine.
*05:51.660- 05:57.420* :  Almost four weeks since the US Congress approved $60 billion of military aid
*05:57.420- 06:00.480* :  against an increasingly intense Russian offensive,
*06:01.000- 06:02.760* :  but only after months of delays.
*06:02.760- 06:06.360* :  Speaking in care, Mr Blinken assured President Vladimir Zelensky
*06:06.560- 06:08.960* :  that weapons are now on their way to the frontline.
*06:09.500- 06:12.160* :  The American people's support for Ukraine has been consistent
*06:13.100- 06:14.040* :  over the course of the war.
*06:15.060- 06:16.400* :  It has never wavered.
*06:17.260- 06:19.140* :  Americans understand that our support for Ukraine
*06:19.600- 06:23.060* :  strengthens the security of the United States and our allies.
*06:23.860- 06:27.000* :  They understand that if Putin achieves his goals here in Ukraine,
*06:27.940- 06:29.300* :  he won't stop with Ukraine.
*06:30.280- 06:30.920* :  He'll keep going.
*06:31.780- 06:34.140* :  For when in history has an autocrat been satisfied
*06:35.180- 06:39.480* :  with carving off just part or even all of a single country?
*06:40.220- 06:42.320* :  When has that satisfied Vladimir Putin?
*06:42.820- 06:44.980* :  Although the US weapons are certainly needed,
*06:45.340- 06:48.440* :  Ukrainian forces are still struggling to cope with a major Russian
*06:48.440- 06:51.400* :  incursion in the northeast around the city of Harkiv.
*06:51.880- 06:55.740* :  Our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel is embedded with Ukrainian forces there.
*06:58.420- 07:02.040* :  There was some resistance when Russian troops first crossed the border.
*07:02.780- 07:04.960* :  Video posted by Ukrainian border guards
*07:05.380- 07:07.720* :  shows them trying to stop their advance.
*07:08.860- 07:13.060* :  But there's drone footage too of Russian troops simply walking across the border,
*07:13.600- 07:14.320* :  unopposed.
*07:14.680- 07:18.280* :  They've captured more than 50 square miles of Ukrainian territory
*07:18.780- 07:19.720* :  in a matter of days.
*07:20.140- 07:22.180* :  Even Ukraine's most senior commanders
*07:22.180- 07:26.360* :  admit the situation is critical, difficult and tense.
*07:26.580- 07:29.300* :  People living close to the fighting are still fleeing.
*07:29.640- 07:31.420* :  Some say the Russians were advancing
*07:31.940- 07:34.720* :  with the sound of machine gun fire getting closer.
*07:35.180- 07:37.340* :  Yana had already packed all her belongings
*07:38.080- 07:40.800* :  even before this latest Russian assault.
*07:41.380- 07:42.660* :  Yes, we were ready.
*07:43.240- 07:49.360* :  Yes, we were ready because all the warnings were just clear
*07:49.820- 07:50.920* :  that that could happen.
*07:51.320- 07:53.680* :  And do you think the Ukrainian army was ready?
*07:54.320- 07:55.240* :  I don't think so.
*07:56.160- 07:56.900* :  I don't think so.
*07:56.940- 08:02.840* :  I think that they were ready that Russians could come,
*08:02.840- 08:07.360* :  but our line of defense is not ready.
*08:07.980- 08:10.200* :  This is the second time that Russian forces
*08:10.200- 08:11.700* :  have entered Harkiv region.
*08:12.080- 08:14.800* :  They've already left several villages and towns in ruins
*08:15.460- 08:16.860* :  and they're doing the same again.
*08:17.180- 08:20.680* :  Ukraine pushed the Russians back in an offensive in 2022,
*08:21.720- 08:24.220* :  but this time they've been starved of ammunition.
*08:25.160- 08:27.960* :  Ukraine's limited resources are stretched
*08:28.380- 08:31.560* :  and President Putin's forces are making advances
*08:32.240- 08:33.480* :  across the entire front.
*08:34.260- 08:36.300* :  Our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel
*08:36.300- 08:38.340* :  with Ukrainian forces in Harkiv.
*08:39.100- 08:41.620* :  Lawyers for Donald Trump have been cross-examining
*08:41.620- 08:43.440* :  his former fixer Michael Cohen
*08:43.440- 08:46.420* :  at the ex-presidents Hush Money Trial in New York.
*08:47.040- 08:48.580* :  Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty
*08:48.580- 08:51.340* :  to falsifying business records and denies
*08:51.380- 08:53.380* :  having his sexual encounter with the adult
*08:53.380- 08:54.980* :  film actor Stormy Daniels.
*08:55.480- 08:57.460* :  Speaking to reporters as he left court,
*08:57.460- 09:00.240* :  Mr. Trump gave his assessment of the day's proceedings.
*09:00.760- 09:05.100* :  The day we had a very good day before you see what's happening.
*09:05.680- 09:07.200* :  And you'll have to report it,
*09:07.240- 09:09.020* :  because I can't talk about it too much.
*09:09.900- 09:12.360* :  But I think it was a very, very good day.
*09:13.140- 09:15.480* :  Michael Cohen was giving evidence for a second day
*09:15.820- 09:18.740* :  and faced tough questioning from Mr. Trump's defence lawyers
*09:18.740- 09:20.880* :  who sought to undermine his testimony.
*09:21.420- 09:24.580* :  Our correspondent at the trial in New York is John Sudworth.
*09:25.080- 09:27.100* :  In terms of that attack on his integrity,
*09:27.100- 09:30.600* :  the prosecution tried to get their retaliation in early.
*09:31.080- 09:34.020* :  They had Mr. Cohen admit on the stand
*09:34.520- 09:37.900* :  that he was indeed prone to having told lies
*09:38.340- 09:41.560* :  that he was himself convicted and disgraced
*09:41.880- 09:44.980* :  in 2018, that he had fallen out with Mr. Trump.
*09:45.700- 09:48.440* :  But they were very careful in doing all that
*09:48.440- 09:51.240* :  to make it clear in Mr. Cohen's own words
*09:51.240- 09:53.600* :  that when he was lying, when he was doing those things,
*09:53.600- 09:56.080* :  when he was engaged in criminal conduct,
*09:56.080- 09:58.580* :  it was almost all at the behest
*09:58.880- 10:01.500* :  and under the instructions of his boss.
*10:01.860- 10:03.400* :  It's a pre-traumatic in court.
*10:03.620- 10:05.460* :  One thing that I spotted today was that
*10:05.500- 10:08.300* :  Donald Trump seems to have quite an entourage with him
*10:08.680- 10:10.180* :  of some of his Republican allies.
*10:10.380- 10:11.160* :  What's that all about?
*10:11.360- 10:13.420* :  Well, it's not the first time that we've had
*10:13.420- 10:16.980* :  political supporters of Mr. Trump turn up here at the court,
*10:16.980- 10:21.660* :  but it was significant today because amongst the governors
*10:21.660- 10:25.620* :  and the senators, there was also the speaker of the House,
*10:25.620- 10:30.120* :  Mike Johnson, of course, a very senior political figure in America.
*10:30.840- 10:33.680* :  Basically, he's here to support Donald Trump.
*10:34.780- 10:39.200* :  But in doing so, making some pretty strident statements,
*10:39.200- 10:42.980* :  he said, for example, that nobody should believe a word
*10:42.980- 10:45.240* :  that Michael Cohen says on the stand.
*10:45.300- 10:47.060* :  He called this a corrupt trial.
*10:47.120- 10:48.540* :  He attacked the judge's daughter.
*10:48.860- 10:50.240* :  All the things, of course, Andrew,
*10:50.240- 10:53.000* :  that Donald Trump is prohibited himself from doing
*10:53.000- 10:54.600* :  under the gag order.
*10:55.020- 10:57.740* :  And looking at this, you can say, of course,
*10:57.740- 10:59.640* :  that there are legitimate legal discussions,
*10:59.640- 11:02.700* :  debates as there always are at high-profile criminal trials
*11:02.700- 11:05.380* :  over the merits of the case, the likelihood of its success,
*11:05.840- 11:07.260* :  whether or not this case should be brought,
*11:07.260- 11:09.680* :  but that is entirely different from the charge
*11:09.680- 11:12.860* :  that this is a case that is brought politically motivated
*11:13.120- 11:14.560* :  back to the Biden administration.
*11:14.560- 11:17.680* :  There is absolutely no evidence for that claim.
*11:17.680- 11:21.460* :  And some people will say that having senior Republican figures,
*11:21.460- 11:23.780* :  people who hold a constitutional position here
*11:23.780- 11:25.640* :  and making that claim is dangerous.
*11:25.640- 11:27.200* :  It undermines American democracy.
*11:27.700- 11:30.140* :  And there is, of course, a certain irony in that they are doing it
*11:30.140- 11:32.900* :  in support of a man who himself is accused
*11:33.340- 11:38.460* :  of having tried to illegitimately disrupt a legitimate transfer
*11:38.460- 11:41.880* :  of power back in 2021, undermining democracy himself.
*11:41.880- 11:44.940* :  And does it feel like a serious legal proceeding?
*11:44.940- 11:46.280* :  Or does it feel like a circus?
*11:46.840- 11:49.800* :  Well, there are two different trials taking place here.
*11:49.800- 11:51.060* :  Andrew, the one inside the court,
*11:51.060- 11:53.900* :  which is absolutely a serious legal proceedings
*11:53.900- 11:58.140* :  under proper evidential rules under the careful watch of a trial judge
*11:58.140- 12:00.840* :  with a jury taking notes and a lot at stake.
*12:01.140- 12:03.340* :  Outside of the court, it is a different matter
*12:03.340- 12:06.400* :  and it is clear that Donald Trump is determined,
*12:07.140- 12:08.680* :  not only to fight this in court,
*12:08.680- 12:10.160* :  but to fight it, as he always does,
*12:10.660- 12:12.420* :  in the court of public opinion too.
*12:12.600- 12:14.580* :  And, you know, that entourage we saw today,
*12:14.580- 12:17.700* :  the presence of Mike Johnston is all part of that bigger strategy.
*12:18.520- 12:20.400* :  John Sudworth with me from New York.
*12:21.040- 12:22.380* :  When he was American president,
*12:22.380- 12:25.760* :  Mr Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports from China.
*12:25.760- 12:29.380* :  Today, President Biden seems to be in agreement with his predecessor.
*12:29.880- 12:32.180* :  He's not only keeping the tariffs from the Trump presidency,
*12:32.220- 12:33.940* :  but bringing in far more.
*12:33.940- 12:38.940* :  Mr. Biden accused China of unfairly pouring state subsidies into its industries,
*12:38.940- 12:42.100* :  which make far too much and then flood international markets,
*12:42.540- 12:44.380* :  driving U.S. companies out of business.
*12:44.860- 12:46.700* :  He announced the new tariffs at the White House.
*12:47.100- 12:50.180* :  That's why today I'm announcing new tariffs and key sectors of the economy.
*12:50.180- 12:54.500* :  They're going to ensure that our workers are not held back by unfair trade practices.
*12:55.260- 12:58.100* :  25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products.
*12:58.560- 13:01.240* :  A 100% tariff on electric vehicles made in China,
*13:01.240- 13:02.040* :  and people say, wow,
*13:02.780- 13:07.100* :  for some 98-25% tariff on electric vehicle batteries from China,
*13:07.580- 13:11.320* :  I'm determined that the future of electric vehicles we made in America.
*13:12.220- 13:15.080* :  Fubing thank the executive vice president and secretary-general
*13:15.300- 13:18.220* :  of the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers,
*13:18.500- 13:20.700* :  said Mr. Biden wasn't just punishing China,
*13:20.700- 13:22.440* :  but also American consumers.
*13:25.160- 13:29.480* :  The United States wants to impose tariffs on Chinese new energy vehicles,
*13:30.180- 13:31.980* :  which is a typical example of trade,
*13:31.980- 13:34.420* :  protectionism, which can only do harm,
*13:34.420- 13:37.800* :  hurting businesses and consumers on both sides.
*13:37.800- 13:41.660* :  I felt like more from our North America business correspondent, Erin Delmore.
*13:42.200- 13:46.480* :  We're talking about tariffs hikes on 18 billion dollars worth of imports from China.
*13:46.940- 13:48.520* :  Some of these are existing and increased,
*13:48.520- 13:52.520* :  but they're all focusing on the key industries that power the green transition.
*13:52.700- 13:55.160* :  It's been a real cornerstone for the Biden administration,
*13:55.160- 13:58.120* :  even going back as far as the inflation reduction act.
*13:58.400- 14:00.920* :  These clean energy sectors looking to invest in them
*14:00.920- 14:04.000* :  and to grow those sectors and those jobs in America.
*14:04.000- 14:07.380* :  So we're looking at a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs
*14:07.680- 14:10.440* :  that are imported into the US up from 25%.
*14:10.800- 14:13.780* :  A doubling of the tariff on solar cells to 50%,
*14:14.100- 14:16.960* :  and a doubling of the tariff on semiconductors to 50%.
*14:16.960- 14:18.880* :  We hear about semiconductors all the time.
*14:18.900- 14:21.320* :  They're one of the hottest ticket items in tech today.
*14:21.920- 14:24.420* :  So President Biden's administration says that these are designed
*14:24.420- 14:27.380* :  to protect U.S. manufacturers from being undercut by China.
*14:27.660- 14:29.340* :  You went to the podium today at the White House,
*14:29.340- 14:32.840* :  talking about how important this is for protecting American jobs.
*14:32.840- 14:37.260* :  And there's a real business, global, and also political imperative here.
*14:37.480- 14:41.240* :  Now, China have come up with a sort of slightly cross-sending response today.
*14:41.240- 14:42.160* :  What can they actually do?
*14:42.360- 14:44.360* :  So we are looking to see if there will be a response,
*14:44.360- 14:46.400* :  and there is likely to be one.
*14:46.560- 14:48.460* :  But when you flush this out, step-by-step,
*14:48.460- 14:51.900* :  you know, you start to ask whether we could start to see a tit-for-tat escalation.
*14:51.900- 14:54.240* :  And remember, this has been going on for a long time.
*14:54.240- 14:56.280* :  We all remember the President Trump era,
*14:56.660- 14:57.940* :  steel, and aluminum tariffs.
*14:58.000- 15:00.340* :  And in fact, this Biden administration plan
*15:00.860- 15:03.600* :  was born out of a review of those tariffs.
*15:04.260- 15:06.380* :  So out of the $18 billion of imports,
*15:06.380- 15:08.780* :  it strikes me that there's less than 5%.
*15:09.360- 15:13.600* :  The ones targeted, I mean, are less than 5% of our total imports from China.
*15:14.080- 15:18.900* :  And so the numbers themselves are a bit smaller than you might anticipate,
*15:18.900- 15:22.120* :  especially from how big this announcement has been from the White House.
*15:22.300- 15:25.820* :  That I expect to be an important factor in how China responds.
*15:26.040- 15:27.480* :  The context, I think, is so interesting.
*15:27.480- 15:30.120* :  Everything through the prison of the election coming up in November.
*15:30.380- 15:32.320* :  We're going to get many months now of Trump and Biden
*15:32.660- 15:34.740* :  tearing lumps out of each other and saying they hate each other.
*15:35.000- 15:37.760* :  On this, they literally agree about every detail, don't they?
*15:37.900- 15:38.520* :  Close, yeah.
*15:38.520- 15:42.100* :  And in fact, you know, this is something that President Trump came out and said he was talking about
*15:42.500- 15:46.380* :  a 60% or higher tariff across the board on imports from China.
*15:46.380- 15:48.040* :  You know, when you look at the polling,
*15:48.240- 15:50.860* :  and I often dig into this from the Pew Research Center and others,
*15:50.860- 15:57.000* :  you can see that being tough on Beijing is broadly popular among Democrats and Republicans.
*15:57.000- 16:00.700* :  And we can't say that about a lot of things in American culture today.
*16:01.040- 16:03.320* :  So I think both presidents know that this could do something,
*16:04.040- 16:07.060* :  especially in swing states to pump up their numbers come the election.
*16:07.620- 16:08.660* :  Aaron Delmore with me.
*16:09.040- 16:11.520* :  A new study has found the summer of 2023.
*16:11.520- 16:15.700* :  It was the warmest in the northern hemisphere in 2000 years.
*16:15.700- 16:20.140* :  Researchers in Britain and Germany say temperatures last June, July and August,
*16:20.140- 16:24.740* :  when nearly four degrees Celsius warmer than the coolest summer in that period.
*16:25.240- 16:28.420* :  They say global warming, combined with the El Nino climate pattern,
*16:28.420- 16:30.400* :  made last year an exceptional event.
*16:30.400- 16:33.020* :  Here's our environment correspondent, Matt McGraw.
*16:33.740- 16:38.140* :  One of the big challenges for climate scientists is trying to understand just how hot
*16:38.140- 16:41.740* :  current temperatures are compared with the historical record.
*16:42.300- 16:47.100* :  Reliable global data from thermometers exists only from around 1850.
*16:47.600- 16:51.320* :  Going back further requires the use of indirect temperature measures,
*16:51.720- 16:55.580* :  such as tree rings, which record information about the state of the climate
*16:56.040- 16:57.320* :  for each year that they grow.
*16:57.980- 17:00.540* :  This study used ones that grew at high altitudes,
*17:00.540- 17:04.120* :  such as the European Alps and the Russian Altai Mountains.
*17:04.840- 17:09.580* :  Professor Alf Bunchen from the University of Cambridge is one of the studies co-authors.
*17:09.920- 17:13.100* :  He explained why the location of the trees was important.
*17:13.440- 17:19.900* :  These are sites where tree grows is predominantly controlled by summer temperature.
*17:20.340- 17:24.060* :  So, smart changes in warmer or cooler summer,
*17:24.060- 17:28.600* :  these extreme sites are reflected in the different tree ring parameters.
*17:28.600- 17:31.420* :  So, how wide is the ring, how narrow is the ring?
*17:31.800- 17:36.120* :  Having built an accurate annual picture of past summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere,
*17:36.620- 17:41.280* :  the researchers were able to show that several years were called by sulfur and aerosols
*17:41.280- 17:43.680* :  emitted from large-scale volcanic eruptions.
*17:44.340- 17:48.660* :  The summer of the year 536 was almost four degrees cooler than 2023.
*17:49.460- 17:53.940* :  The main takeaway is that last June, July and August were more than two degrees warmer than
*17:53.940- 17:58.680* :  the average over almost two millennia. This is due to climate change driven by humans,
*17:58.680- 18:01.800* :  with some help from the El Nino weather phenomenon.
*18:02.460- 18:05.640* :  The researchers hope that this greater clarity over climate past
*18:06.140- 18:09.860* :  would prompt political leaders to do much more about climate present.
*18:10.680- 18:11.660* :  Matt McGraw reporting.
*18:14.040- 18:15.320* :  And still to come in this podcast.
*18:15.600- 18:22.240* :  I think in complexities of life, you can hardly apply the words optimistic or pessimistic
*18:22.240- 18:26.260* :  or happy or unhappy to them. They just seem to be terribly interesting.
*18:26.580- 18:31.800* :  Alice Monroe, the first Canadian to win a Nobel Prize for literature, has died at the age of 92.
*18:39.780- 18:42.720* :  Planting for your next trip, elevate your travel style with

*19:16.520- 19:19.440* :  LinkedIn has professionals you can't find anywhere else,
*19:19.620- 19:21.920* :  including those who aren't actively looking for a new job,
*19:22.200- 19:24.780* :  but might be open to the perfect role, like me.
*19:25.340- 19:29.840* :  In a given month, over 70% of LinkedIn users don't visit other leading jobsites.

*19:45.520- 19:48.520* :  The Hollywood actor, Meryl Streep, has been awarded an honorary palm
*19:48.520- 19:51.900* :  door of the opening ceremony of this year's Cam film festival.
*19:52.340- 19:55.360* :  Presenting the prize, the French stars Juliet bin Arche, Thomas Streep,
*19:55.360- 19:57.120* :  she changed the way we look at women.
*19:57.120- 20:02.060* :  This year's film festival is being held against a backdrop of a me too reckoning in France.
*20:02.120- 20:05.700* :  Some of the country's biggest film stars have published an open letter
*20:06.020- 20:10.420* :  calling for a new lord, cracked down on systemic sexism and gender-based violence.
*20:10.420- 20:12.080* :  From Cannes, Tom Brook.
*20:13.340- 20:17.460* :  The French Riviera has been a buzz as the world's biggest and arguably most
*20:17.460- 20:22.320* :  prestigious film festival gets underway. Outside the Palais des Festivals in Cannes,
*20:22.320- 20:24.940* :  where films are shown tourists and movie fans gather.
*20:25.280- 20:29.140* :  It's most important film festival in the world.
*20:29.480- 20:33.140* :  I like when all stars come to one city.
*20:34.400- 20:38.040* :  But there's been uncertainty in the air at Cannes this year with a threatened strike
*20:38.040- 20:41.500* :  by behind-the-scenes workers, including projectionists and ticket sellers.
*20:42.100- 20:45.620* :  And there's also massive chatter about a possible me too protest,
*20:45.620- 20:50.860* :  in which a French website may reveal the names of significant figures in the French film industry
*20:51.240- 20:53.560* :  and their alleged predatory transgressions.
*20:53.920- 20:56.380* :  The festival is trying to keep the focus on movies.
*20:58.280- 21:02.020* :  One of the more eagerly awaited films in competition this year is Megalopolis
*21:02.020- 21:05.920* :  from legendary 85-year-old US director Francis Ford Coppola.
*21:06.560- 21:09.820* :  It's a sci-fi drama set in a city that resembles New York,
*21:10.020- 21:13.520* :  with Adam Driver playing an architect who believes he can stop time.
*21:18.960- 21:22.320* :  During the 12-day festival, Cannes exists as a world apart.
*21:22.320- 21:26.580* :  A film lover's paradise packed with screenings and blitzy events.
*21:26.580- 21:31.540* :  But the harsh realities of the outside world won't be kept at bay this year,
*21:31.820- 21:34.600* :  because they'll be evident in several festival films.
*21:38.320- 21:42.280* :  An air raid siren in Keeve can be heard in a funeral scene in the haunting
*21:42.280- 21:44.760* :  Cannes documentary called The Invasion.
*21:44.960- 21:48.920* :  It comes from one of Ukraine's foremost filmmakers, Sergei Lasnitsa.
*21:49.200- 21:53.300* :  It's a mammoth work involving a series of carefully composed, extended sequences
*21:53.720- 21:55.660* :  showing life in Ukraine since the invasion.
*21:58.700- 22:03.400* :  And the Israel-Garza conflict will no doubt color how festival gods perceive the Cannes film
*22:03.400- 22:07.040* :  The Bell from Garza, a documentary in which transgender women,
*22:07.040- 22:11.780* :  several from Palestinian families, are seen on the streets of Tel Aviv discussing their lives.
*22:13.020- 22:17.920* :  And while former President Donald Trump sits in a New York courtroom 4,000 miles from Cannes,
*22:18.100- 22:22.520* :  one of the bigger attractions at the festival will be the apprentice of film portraying him
*22:22.760- 22:26.340* :  in his younger years as a rising force in the New York real estate world.
*22:30.580- 22:33.600* :  Cannes has a knack for recognizing great cinema.
*22:33.960- 22:38.600* :  Last year, the French legal drama Anatomy of a Fall and the British Polish Holocaust
*22:38.600- 22:43.500* :  era picture The Zone of Interest were both launched at Cannes where they were given prizes.
*22:44.080- 22:48.180* :  They went on to win critical acclaim around the world and academy awards.
*22:48.980- 22:54.640* :  So what we may be witnessing here in Cannes next few days is the emergence of early contenders
*22:55.040- 22:56.700* :  in next year's Oscar's race.
*22:58.020- 23:03.400* :  In northern France, two prison officers have been killed as an inmate was freed by a heavily armed
*23:03.400- 23:08.800* :  gang as he was being transported back to jail. The man who was freed, Mohammed Amra, is believed
*23:08.800- 23:13.940* :  to have linked to a criminal gang. A huge search involving hundreds of police officers is still
*23:13.940- 23:19.040* :  underway. The French Prime Minister, Gabrielle Attal, says the group will be brought to justice.
*23:19.380- 23:25.060* :  Toussura, Mizonevo. Everything will be done to find the perpetrators of this despicable crime.
*23:25.060- 23:31.360* :  We will spare no effort, no means. We will track them down. We will find them and they will pay.
*23:31.360- 23:35.860* :  We owe it to the victims. We owe it to their families and loved ones. We owe it to all members
*23:35.860- 23:39.800* :  of the prison administration. We owe it to all French people.
*23:40.660- 23:44.860* :  Our correspondent Hugh Scofield is following developments and spoke to my colleague Sean Leigh.
*23:45.240- 23:51.120* :  This is Sean Leigh. The government has determined that every resource should be thrown at the
*23:51.120- 23:56.860* :  tracking down of these men and it means I think that there are hundreds of officers out there,
*23:56.860- 24:02.760* :  Jean-Dame and police in the area and beyond now and there'll be some on the ground. Many others
*24:02.760- 24:07.120* :  I'm sure pouring over the various bits of intelligence which are going to be coming in and from
*24:07.120- 24:11.860* :  analysis of the scene and so on. One suspect that eventually they'll be cornered. But who knows
*24:11.860- 24:17.360* :  where? They had a good advance and they zoomed away in cars. The vehicles were left behind so
*24:17.360- 24:21.400* :  they're in other cars which won't be necessarily known to the police. It's a big operation because
*24:21.400- 24:26.460* :  the country and the government are particularly appalled by the savagery of the attack and the
*24:26.460- 24:30.600* :  wanton violence and the willingness to take lives which a company did. You're at the scene.
*24:30.620- 24:35.760* :  There's signs of just how violent this was. Clearly the police are there and I've been
*24:36.480- 24:42.740* :  pouring over the detail and the forensic detail they can get from the scene. I couldn't see
*24:42.740- 24:47.860* :  enough because we kept well up to see traces of blood really like that but it was all
*24:47.860- 24:53.860* :  had it all been cleared up. But it's because of these fatalities. What do we know about the prisoner
*24:53.860- 24:59.720* :  who has escaped the man who was being freed? There's an awful lot being speculated about him.
*25:00.060- 25:05.580* :  One of the things that's being said is why such an enormous professional criminal
*25:06.400- 25:11.420* :  job to rescue a man who by all accounts all to all appearances was only a kind of medium-sized
*25:11.420- 25:18.120* :  fish in the criminal pond. Clearly he had long criminal record but if it's sort of middle-ranking
*25:18.120- 25:24.740* :  things like theft mainly was involved possibly in a murder down in Marseille but that he hasn't
*25:24.740- 25:29.000* :  been convicted of that. The speculation is that he was rather bigger fish than people maybe
*25:29.000- 25:33.980* :  realised or maybe that the authorities realised than that from his cell because he's been in jail
*25:33.980- 25:40.280* :  a lot and he was in jail. He'd been operating systems and networks from his cell.
*25:40.860- 25:46.520* :  A correspondent he's go field. Elections to the European Parliament now just a few weeks away
*25:46.520- 25:51.880* :  with immigration, the economy and environmental measures topping the agenda. Abortion rights
*25:51.880- 25:56.900* :  campaigners say women's health issues aren't getting sufficient attention. Our Europe correspondent
*25:56.900- 26:00.420* :  Jessica Parker has this report from the German City of Hamburg.
*26:03.340- 26:10.200* :  Adriana Bairan volunteers to help improve abortion access after having won herself five years ago.
*26:10.220- 26:15.660* :  She and a fellow campaigner are talking about information leaflets. In Germany abortions are
*26:15.660- 26:21.660* :  in reality permitted during early pregnancy but remain technically illegal.
*26:22.180- 26:29.020* :  When I read the penalty law it really crushed me because it really says you're still a criminal
*26:29.020- 26:34.700* :  when you decide to have an abortion. You can do it up until 12 weeks without being actually punished
*26:35.480- 26:41.340* :  but you're still kind of a criminal and also the law is written like that they're trying to force
*26:41.380- 26:47.300* :  you to think about it and to keep the pregnancy so they're really pushing you into one direction.
*26:47.680- 26:53.260* :  Do you think this issue, women's health issues have a prominent enough
*26:53.720- 27:00.020* :  place in public debate? Of course not. Women's issue are most of the time that like domain
*27:00.020- 27:07.180* :  priority. I really prefer if we have like an EU law that ensures that everyone has access to
*27:07.180- 27:15.320* :  safe abortion. In central Hamburg people relax in the sun sipping coffees,
*27:15.720- 27:21.540* :  even in wealthy liberal cities like this campaigners say women face barriers to abortion while
*27:21.540- 27:28.180* :  access across Europe can significantly vary from France where abortions have become a constitutional
*27:28.180- 27:37.260* :  right to almost totally legality in Poland and Malta. Abortion laws are set by member states but a
*27:37.260- 27:43.720* :  majority of EU lawmakers in the last parliament called for access to be guaranteed across the block.
*27:44.140- 27:50.660* :  It's a prime example of how some often more in the centre or left of politics see the EU as an
*27:50.660- 27:56.840* :  engine for social change, while others often more to the right believe Brussels is already
*27:57.300- 28:02.460* :  too interfering. They were always tapping their competencies because that's not really their
*28:02.460- 28:09.460* :  business. In a Hamburg park I meet Cornelia Kaminsky. She leads a group called Action Right to Life
*28:09.460- 28:15.420* :  for all that campaigns against abortion. While the EU Parliament's vote was largely symbolic,
*28:15.420- 28:22.520* :  she warns against EU overreach. It's up to the nations to say whether they want to have this
*28:22.620- 28:27.680* :  or that particular abortion law and the EU shouldn't meddle with that. They've done that with other
*28:27.680- 28:33.480* :  things. They try to interfere with nations sovereignty and I think they shouldn't push the
*28:33.480- 28:39.500* :  nations too far. We've seen what happens if they do that and when people pick up on those ideas
*28:39.500- 28:45.220* :  in particular countries you saw that in the UK and they play it well then people might turn away
*28:45.220- 28:51.260* :  on a larger scale from the European Union and that's not a good idea. And a law professor at Hamburg
*28:51.260- 28:58.080* :  University Marion Albers believes any EU-wide change is a distant prospect. I think members
*28:58.080- 29:05.840* :  say it's focused very much on having competencies in criminal law and especially in these sensitive
*29:05.980- 29:12.840* :  areas of abortion. I'm standing on a street in Western Hamburg and look you can certainly tell
*29:13.440- 29:18.160* :  that EU elections are just around the corner. There are campaign placards up all over the place
*29:18.560- 29:24.540* :  and if as some polls predict there's a right would shift in this election that could diminish calls
*29:24.540- 29:31.360* :  for embedding abortion rights as parties push starkly different visions of how far the EU should
*29:31.360- 29:39.160* :  reach into people's lives. Jessica Parker reporting, flooding in southern Brazil has continued to
*29:39.160- 29:45.340* :  worsen after three more days of heavy rain. 148 people are known to have died across Rio Grande
*29:45.340- 29:51.260* :  de Sul-State. Here's Leonardo Rosha. After the heavy rain of the previous two weeks stopped on Friday
*29:51.260- 29:57.100* :  some of the 600,000 people who had been forced to leave their homes returned to clean up.
*29:57.480- 30:02.680* :  But the law didn't last. Fresh storms hit the hills outside the state capital Porto Alegre
*30:03.060- 30:08.380* :  causing new landslides and flooding. Water levels on the Guayiba River which passes through
*30:08.380- 30:14.300* :  the city have been rising again. They're now expected to reach a new record high. Many areas of
*30:14.300- 30:21.300* :  Porto Alegre, a city of 1.4 million people remain underwater and without power. This is the
*30:21.300- 30:26.760* :  worst natural disaster in the history of Rio Grande de Sul, Brazil's 7th most state.
*30:27.800- 30:33.260* :  Caledos first ever winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Alice Monroe has died at the age of 92.
*30:33.840- 30:39.600* :  She got the award in 2013 for her ability to master the notoriously difficult art of the short story,
*30:40.040- 30:44.480* :  which she only started writing because she felt she had neither the time nor the talent to
*30:44.480- 30:50.260* :  affect novels. Vincent Dowd looks back at her career. Alice Monroe was born in the small town of
*30:50.260- 30:56.680* :  Wingum, Ontario and she spent much of her life in Ontario, which supplied the characters she wrote
*30:56.680- 31:02.280* :  about with insight. Her subjects, ambition and failure and the comedy of human existence
*31:02.280- 31:08.960* :  rang through with readers well beyond her own country. Her books of stories led some to call her
*31:08.960- 31:16.140* :  Canada's Chekhov. The first collection came in 1968. Five years before that, she and her first
*31:16.140- 31:21.640* :  husband had opened a bookstore in British Columbia called Monroe's Books. As a writer,
*31:21.640- 31:29.040* :  more than a dozen collections of fiction followed. And in 2009, she was awarded the Man Booker
*31:29.040- 31:35.820* :  International Prize. Four years later, came a bigger award. Nobel Prize for Literature,
*31:43.460- 31:50.080* :  2013. The Nobel citation described her simply as a master of the short story. Alice Monroe once said
*31:50.080- 31:55.840* :  in an interview that as she grew older, her view of life became less gloomy.
*31:56.200- 32:01.660* :  I think it's terribly easy when you're young to be very tragic about everything. Perhaps very
*32:01.660- 32:07.740* :  pessimistic and to feel that this really marks your maturity. That's been leaving me in the last
*32:07.740- 32:13.620* :  few books. I think some fairly happy things happen. I think the thing is now that I think in
*32:13.980- 32:20.180* :  complexities of life, you can hardly apply the words optimistic or pessimistic or happy or
*32:20.180- 32:26.240* :  unhappy to them. They just seemed to me terribly interesting. Alice Monroe said the starting point of
*32:26.240- 32:33.280* :  a story was normally a small incident in real life. She said she'd found the first 20 years of her
*32:33.280- 32:39.700* :  life difficult. What came later had been much easier. Vincent Downed reporting.
*32:42.500- 32:46.120* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.

*33:03.320- 33:04.720* :  And until next time, goodbye.
*33:14.860- 33:18.920* :  So, how did it happen? Well, actually, that's a really important question.
*33:19.100- 33:23.680* :  The two countries were essentially enemies. That is of course an allegation that has been
*33:23.680- 33:28.040* :  leveled. Everybody had a different definition of what the problem was. Let's remember the
*33:28.040- 33:34.380* :  background of all these. The explanation is the podcast from the bbc world service making
