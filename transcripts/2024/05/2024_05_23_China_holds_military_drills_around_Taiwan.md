*01:28.580- 01:34.240* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 23rd of May, these are our main stories.
*01:34.860- 01:39.580* :  The Taiwanese president has promised to defend his country after China launched military
*01:39.580- 01:40.920* :  drills around the island.
*01:41.580- 01:46.400* :  A purge of the Russian military is continuing with the arrest of the deputy chief of general
*01:46.620- 01:46.880* :  staff.
*01:47.560- 01:52.980* :  And in northern Mexico, a stage has collapsed at an election rally, killing at least 9 people.
*01:55.040- 02:00.020* :  Also, in this podcast, President Emmanuel Macron, on a visit to the riot hit territory
*02:00.020- 02:04.940* :  of New Caledonia, says French police will remain for as long as necessary.
*02:05.620- 02:11.620* :  And as the UK gets into general election campaign mode, we'll hear from our political correspondent
*02:11.620- 02:12.460* :  Rob Watson.
*02:12.980- 02:15.820* :  The politicians are now crisscrossing the country for votes.
*02:15.940- 02:21.060* :  They face a wary and skeptical electorate, many of whom think Britain isn't working.
*02:25.340- 02:31.040* :  And we begin in Taiwan, where President William Lai has promised to defend freedom and democracy
*02:31.040- 02:34.460* :  as China conducts military exercises around the island.
*02:37.620- 02:42.360* :  I will stand on the front line with all the brothers and sisters from the National Army
*02:42.360- 02:43.560* :  to defend peace.
*02:43.880- 02:50.060* :  We will continue to defend the values of democracy, protecting regional peace and stability.
*02:50.820- 02:55.160* :  Well, China holding military drills around Taiwan is nothing new, but the latest ones appear
*02:55.160- 02:57.140* :  to have an added touch of menace.
*02:57.460- 03:03.280* :  Beijing is simulating a full-scale attack and has described the exercises a strong punishment
*03:03.280- 03:06.000* :  for what it calls Taiwan's separatist acts.
*03:06.020- 03:10.480* :  The two-day drills come three days after the inauguration of Taiwan's new president.
*03:11.240- 03:13.900* :  China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province.
*03:14.700- 03:17.860* :  Sun Li Fang is a spokesman for the Taiwanese Defence Ministry.
*03:18.500- 03:23.920* :  This irrational production has jeopardized regional peace and stability.
*03:24.720- 03:31.080* :  PR sees this patch of aircraft and the vessels harassing its neighbors in recent years
*03:31.600- 03:34.420* :  has certain global peace and stability.
*03:35.060- 03:38.520* :  Stephen McDonald is our Beijing correspondent and he had this assessment.
*03:39.340- 03:46.160* :  Well, this is as much about political pressure as it is about genuine military preparation.
*03:46.540- 03:51.380* :  When you look at the maps that have been provided by the PLA, you can see the zones
*03:51.460- 03:57.820* :  where these exercises are taking place and they're all around Taiwan, effectively in circling Taiwan.
*03:58.360- 04:01.880* :  One way of looking at this is that it shows the people in Taiwan.
*04:01.880- 04:06.560* :  If we want to, we the PLA, if we wanted to blockade you, we could.
*04:06.560- 04:14.120* :  We could stop goods from coming in and in a way eventually force you to unify with the mainland
*04:14.120- 04:15.580* :  because you'd have no choice.
*04:15.580- 04:17.080* :  You'd be cut off from the outside world.
*04:17.600- 04:22.780* :  Another thing it enables the PLA to do is to get ready for an attack at an invasion
*04:22.840- 04:26.100* :  and there's land and craft involved, rocket forces involved.
*04:26.100- 04:31.420* :  But if this was seriously the PLA doing this as a dress rehearsal for an invasion,
*04:31.940- 04:33.880* :  well, in a sense, you're telegraphing your punches.
*04:34.500- 04:38.520* :  And the Taiwanese military has sat back and said, well, where does going to use the next two days
*04:38.520- 04:42.540* :  to collect all the intelligence we possibly can?
*04:43.000- 04:44.940* :  And in that way, thank you very much.
*04:44.940- 04:49.160* :  We can see how you're preparing to invade us and we'll prepare accordingly.
*04:49.540- 04:53.580* :  We've heard from the deputy commander of the US Indo-Pacific command.
*04:53.580- 04:56.480* :  He described it all as concerning but not unexpected.
*04:57.340- 04:59.100* :  What might the impact of this be?
*04:59.340- 05:02.660* :  I think it's meant to put pressure on the government in Taiwan
*05:02.660- 05:05.420* :  and I guess people in Taiwan indirectly.
*05:06.340- 05:07.900* :  The timing of its no coincidence.
*05:07.900- 05:11.800* :  It's just days after the inauguration of the new president.
*05:11.800- 05:13.920* :  This is a leader from a party.
*05:14.180- 05:15.380* :  The Beijing doesn't like.
*05:15.420- 05:19.700* :  They see him as more in favor of Taiwanese independence.
*05:19.700- 05:25.120* :  He's put it that way rather than some form of unity eventually with mainland China.
*05:25.800- 05:30.060* :  But if the goal of the PLA was to freak out the general population,
*05:30.060- 05:31.800* :  if I could put it to you that way,
*05:32.500- 05:34.900* :  one thing that would indicate it maybe hasn't worked
*05:35.340- 05:39.520* :  is the data we're getting on Google searches in Taiwan today.
*05:39.660- 05:41.160* :  Now, what a Taiwanese looking at today.
*05:41.160- 05:43.740* :  Are they looking up all this stuff to do with the military drills?
*05:43.740- 05:44.080* :  No.
*05:44.140- 05:50.340* :  What they are searching for is information on a famous Japanese actor
*05:50.340- 05:53.760* :  who apparently is being accused of infidelity with his wife.
*05:54.140- 05:57.160* :  So this is what's really on the minds of people in Taiwan today.
*05:57.160- 06:00.540* :  I guess they're becoming quite blasé about these exercises.
*06:00.980- 06:03.520* :  And in a way, Beijing then has two options.
*06:03.580- 06:05.780* :  It can either keep ratcheting up these exercises
*06:05.780- 06:07.080* :  to make them more serious
*06:07.680- 06:11.820* :  or find another means of trying to pressure people in Taiwan
*06:11.820- 06:14.260* :  to somehow rather come round to thinking.
*06:14.720- 06:16.720* :  They would want to reunify with the mainland.
*06:16.720- 06:19.460* :  But given all the research that's been done on that
*06:19.460- 06:20.980* :  on the thoughts of people in Taiwan,
*06:20.980- 06:24.000* :  I think that's a very, very tough thing for them to do.
*06:24.560- 06:26.740* :  Stephen McDonald, now to Russia,
*06:27.120- 06:29.140* :  where another general has been arrested
*06:29.580- 06:32.440* :  as what appears to be a purge of the military continues.
*06:33.100- 06:36.500* :  Vadim Shamarin, the deputy chief of general staff,
*06:36.500- 06:39.400* :  has appeared in court accused of taking bribes.
*06:39.660- 06:42.800* :  He's the fourth senior official to be arrested since April.
*06:43.440- 06:45.240* :  Earlier this month, President Putin
*06:45.240- 06:48.260* :  appointed the economist and former deputy prime minister
*06:48.640- 06:51.100* :  André Pielosov as defense minister.
*06:51.740- 06:53.640* :  The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
*06:53.660- 06:55.600* :  denied that a purge was underway.
*06:57.800- 06:59.420* :  The fight against corruption is consistent.
*06:59.480- 07:00.780* :  It's not a campaign.
*07:00.780- 07:02.620* :  It's constantly ongoing work.
*07:02.980- 07:04.560* :  It's an integral part of the activities
*07:04.560- 07:06.180* :  of our law enforcement agencies.
*07:06.700- 07:09.380* :  I cannot give any details as I'm not authorized to do it,
*07:09.600- 07:11.100* :  but it is not a campaign.
*07:11.760- 07:14.080* :  Nikki Cardwell is our Europe regional editor.
*07:14.820- 07:17.080* :  This is the fourth senior military arrest
*07:17.080- 07:19.900* :  that we've seen since the end of April.
*07:20.520- 07:23.320* :  We know that when he was arrested, his house was searched
*07:23.600- 07:25.640* :  and he's already appeared in court
*07:25.980- 07:27.440* :  charged with large-scale bribery.
*07:27.440- 07:29.360* :  And as you say, that's a 15-year sentence,
*07:29.880- 07:31.160* :  if he's convicted.
*07:31.160- 07:33.860* :  It is the latest in this chain that we're seeing.
*07:33.860- 07:35.260* :  He's less high profile,
*07:35.700- 07:37.040* :  but the important thing is what he does.
*07:37.040- 07:40.400* :  He is in charge of procurement and communication
*07:40.600- 07:44.960* :  and getting a lot of stuff to the troops on the front line.
*07:45.420- 07:48.320* :  So clearly, that's the area that they've been looking at with him.
*07:48.980- 07:51.360* :  And the new minister very much playing to his strengths.
*07:52.020- 07:53.480* :  He is indeed. When he was pointed,
*07:53.480- 07:56.980* :  people pointed out that he actually didn't have any military experience.
*07:56.980- 07:58.980* :  At all, he'd never served a day.
*07:58.980- 08:01.740* :  He's an economist and was a civil servant.
*08:01.740- 08:03.880* :  He's come up through the civil service.
*08:04.160- 08:05.640* :  One of the quotes I've seen from people
*08:05.640- 08:07.900* :  know is that he's not corrupt,
*08:07.900- 08:09.860* :  that he is one of the most honest men
*08:09.880- 08:10.860* :  they've ever come across.
*08:11.320- 08:14.500* :  So in terms of what Vladimir Putin wanted to do
*08:14.700- 08:16.820* :  in rooting out some of the corruption
*08:16.820- 08:20.420* :  that has been endemic in the Army procurement system,
*08:20.420- 08:24.000* :  he was clearly the man that he wanted for that job.
*08:24.520- 08:26.760* :  And what is the Kremlin saying about him,
*08:26.760- 08:28.860* :  about the other sackings and arrests?
*08:29.300- 08:31.380* :  And what does it mean going forward
*08:31.460- 08:32.960* :  for the conduct of the Ukraine war?
*08:33.380- 08:35.440* :  Well, we have heard something from Dimitri Peskov,
*08:35.440- 08:37.100* :  who is the Kremlin spokesman.
*08:37.340- 08:38.620* :  He spoke to journalists this morning
*08:38.620- 08:40.440* :  and denied that it was a purge.
*08:40.700- 08:43.880* :  He said this is just part of the role of law and order
*08:44.060- 08:45.920* :  and he said that the fight against corruption
*08:46.320- 08:48.300* :  would continue in all departments.
*08:48.300- 08:50.540* :  Now, what this means for Ukraine,
*08:50.540- 08:52.000* :  if you remember at the beginning of the war,
*08:52.000- 08:54.140* :  there was a lot of criticism online,
*08:54.200- 08:57.480* :  particularly about the inability to get stuff to the front line.
*08:57.940- 09:00.880* :  And this is part of the process of trying to improve that.
*09:01.340- 09:02.360* :  That was Nikki Cardwell.
*09:03.220- 09:04.360* :  Here in the UK,
*09:04.360- 09:07.220* :  the first full day of political campaigning
*09:07.220- 09:09.420* :  ahead of the general election is well underway.
*09:10.120- 09:12.060* :  With the vote set for July 4th,
*09:12.180- 09:14.080* :  the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
*09:14.080- 09:16.920* :  toured broadcasting studios on Thursday morning.
*09:17.460- 09:21.080* :  On BBC Radio, he was asked why he had called the election now.
*09:21.660- 09:23.700* :  I'm not claiming for a second that the job is done,
*09:23.700- 09:26.180* :  and yes, you're right, there is still more work to do.
*09:26.500- 09:27.980* :  But when I came into this job,
*09:27.980- 09:31.460* :  my overriding priority was to bring economic stability back.
*09:31.860- 09:33.120* :  And we have done that.
*09:33.160- 09:33.940* :  It's taken time.
*09:33.940- 09:36.420* :  It's taken tough decisions that weren't easy
*09:36.420- 09:38.220* :  and people criticized, but I stuck to it
*09:38.220- 09:40.180* :  because I believed it was right for our country.
*09:40.560- 09:42.060* :  And now inflation is back to normal,
*09:42.060- 09:44.660* :  thanks to everyone's hard work and collective sacrifice.
*09:45.140- 09:49.300* :  Mr. Sunak will now go on a two-day tour of all four UK nations.
*09:49.900- 09:52.380* :  The Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer
*09:52.380- 09:55.600* :  kicked off his campaign in the Conservative Heartland of Kent
*09:55.600- 09:56.700* :  in Southeast England.
*09:57.340- 09:59.140* :  This election is about a choice.
*09:59.180- 10:03.120* :  Two different countries, two different futures,
*10:03.660- 10:05.960* :  decline and chaos continuing under Tories
*10:06.380- 10:09.020* :  or rebuilding our country under Labour.
*10:09.560- 10:11.700* :  The power of the vote is with you.
*10:11.920- 10:15.020* :  If you want change, you have to vote for it.
*10:15.260- 10:18.400* :  And if you vote Labour, it's a vote to stop the chaos.
*10:18.480- 10:20.720* :  It's a vote to turn the page.
*10:21.120- 10:23.940* :  And it's a vote to rebuild our country together.
*10:24.800- 10:28.560* :  So how different are the two main party leaders visions for the country?
*10:28.920- 10:32.420* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson told us more from Downing Street.
*10:33.120- 10:36.520* :  They're very different in the sense that you've essentially got an argument
*10:36.520- 10:39.020* :  from the Conservatives, which is that,
*10:39.460- 10:40.400* :  better than devil you know,
*10:40.880- 10:42.720* :  we're on the right track, stick with us,
*10:43.220- 10:46.020* :  versus the classic argument in elections,
*10:46.020- 10:48.220* :  which is that it is a time for a change.
*10:48.400- 10:51.340* :  And I think that is going to be the entire dynamic
*10:51.340- 10:54.960* :  for the next five or six weeks with the Conservatives claiming look.
*10:55.520- 10:57.980* :  You know, there is somewhat better news on the economy,
*10:57.980- 10:59.620* :  which you really want to risk anything
*10:59.620- 11:01.780* :  in a sort of difficult, unstable world
*11:02.240- 11:03.640* :  on an untested opposition.
*11:04.160- 11:06.480* :  And you'll get Keir Starmer and the rest of the Labour Party
*11:06.480- 11:08.540* :  repeatedly asking the British people look
*11:09.040- 11:11.540* :  after 14 years of Conservative government,
*11:11.540- 11:14.560* :  you feel better off or do you think it's time for change?
*11:15.140- 11:16.820* :  And of course, journalists love elections,
*11:16.980- 11:18.740* :  but what's the mood like in the country?
*11:18.740- 11:19.760* :  What about the electorate?
*11:19.980- 11:24.080* :  The politicians are going to be up against a very unhappy electorate
*11:24.220- 11:26.420* :  and polling survey after polling survey
*11:26.420- 11:28.020* :  and anecdotal evidence, Jackie,
*11:28.460- 11:29.680* :  suggest two things.
*11:29.680- 11:33.540* :  First of all, that large majorities of the British population
*11:33.920- 11:36.380* :  think that somehow the country is on the wrong track
*11:36.380- 11:39.120* :  that things are gone wrong, things aren't working properly.
*11:39.620- 11:42.780* :  But secondly, and this is the real complication for the politicians,
*11:42.900- 11:44.400* :  the surveys also suggest
*11:44.940- 11:47.320* :  that British people are just incredibly negative
*11:47.660- 11:50.180* :  about the system, about political leaders,
*11:50.460- 11:52.240* :  including Mr Starmer and Mr Sunak,
*11:52.620- 11:55.080* :  and about the political parties themselves.
*11:55.080- 11:58.560* :  So as they crisscross the country as they're starting to do,
*11:58.980- 12:00.560* :  they're really going to be up against it.
*12:00.720- 12:02.540* :  And we've heard from Labour and the Conservatives,
*12:03.120- 12:05.520* :  what about the other parties on the campaign trail?
*12:05.840- 12:08.900* :  Yes, it's important to remember that opinion polling suggests
*12:08.900- 12:11.560* :  that maybe as many as the third of the electorate
*12:11.560- 12:13.280* :  are going to look to smaller parties,
*12:13.280- 12:14.600* :  such as the Green Party,
*12:15.040- 12:17.460* :  to the Liberal Democrats, to the Nationalist parties
*12:17.980- 12:19.540* :  in Scotland and in Wales,
*12:19.540- 12:22.280* :  and of course to an insurgent, right-wing party,
*12:22.840- 12:23.620* :  called reform.
*12:23.620- 12:26.300* :  So they'll all be making the case none of the above.
*12:26.440- 12:29.600* :  But I think the sort of political skepticism, cynicism
*12:29.600- 12:32.380* :  and weariness, I think it extends to all parties
*12:32.760- 12:34.340* :  on behalf of the British electorate.
*12:34.700- 12:35.580* :  That was Rob Watson.
*12:36.900- 12:39.900* :  The families of the 19 children and two teachers
*12:40.160- 12:43.140* :  killed in a school shooting in Texas two years ago
*12:43.560- 12:45.680* :  have settled for $2 million compensation
*12:45.680- 12:47.340* :  from the city of Yvaldae.
*12:47.900- 12:50.900* :  Now, $2 million might not seem much compensation
*12:50.900- 12:53.220* :  for their loss, but Lillia Luciano,
*12:53.220- 12:56.200* :  a correspondent for our partner's CBS News,
*12:56.200- 12:58.500* :  who's in Yvaldae, explained why.
*12:59.180- 13:02.980* :  This settlement, while low, is made in the attempt to
*13:03.400- 13:06.300* :  mend to heal the divisions that have existed in this community
*13:06.840- 13:09.040* :  since those families went through the trauma
*13:09.040- 13:12.020* :  of losing those 19 children and two teachers.
*13:12.240- 13:14.160* :  At first, the community came together,
*13:14.600- 13:16.340* :  but of course, the calls for accountability
*13:16.340- 13:19.080* :  began once the videos started emerging,
*13:19.080- 13:21.060* :  and more information made it to the public
*13:21.380- 13:24.240* :  that law enforcement had waited 77 minutes
*13:24.720- 13:27.440* :  between the moment that the shooter entered a classroom
*13:27.500- 13:29.960* :  and the moment that they finally breached the door
*13:29.960- 13:31.960* :  and stopped him by killing him.
*13:32.180- 13:34.680* :  The children in the meantime were calling 911,
*13:35.280- 13:36.240* :  hiding from him.
*13:36.600- 13:39.940* :  And of course, that police response has led to a great deal
*13:39.940- 13:44.040* :  of questions, activism demands for accountability.
*13:44.620- 13:46.100* :  That has caused some divisions.
*13:46.240- 13:50.360* :  That and the calls for gun control reforms in the US
*13:50.360- 13:53.260* :  that these families have been in the forefront of.
*13:53.760- 13:56.720* :  And so because of those divisions within the local community,
*13:56.720- 13:59.420* :  families did not want to financially burden
*13:59.960- 14:01.180* :  their community, their city.
*14:01.600- 14:03.500* :  Therefore, they are settling for $2 million.
*14:03.580- 14:06.360* :  It comes from the insurance of the city.
*14:06.360- 14:10.420* :  That said, they're also filing a $500 million lawsuit
*14:10.420- 14:13.520* :  against the state of Texas because it was the state
*14:13.520- 14:16.340* :  of Texas police, DPS, the agency,
*14:16.840- 14:18.880* :  the one police agency that had the highest,
*14:18.880- 14:22.920* :  the greatest number of officers present during that time
*14:22.920- 14:25.780* :  that children were in there waiting to be saved.
*14:25.780- 14:29.500* :  They're also suing Motorola, which manufactures
*14:29.500- 14:32.180* :  the police radios, which failed during that process,
*14:32.680- 14:34.860* :  as well as the incident commander,
*14:34.860- 14:37.180* :  who was an employee of the school district,
*14:37.600- 14:38.960* :  the school principal and others.
*14:39.480- 14:41.560* :  We're hearing that maybe there's going to be another settlement
*14:42.140- 14:44.200* :  with the county here in Yvalde.
*14:44.680- 14:47.800* :  These families, as much as they want to mend the relationship
*14:47.800- 14:51.380* :  with their neighbors, are still loudly calling for accountability.
*14:51.380- 14:53.660* :  As we approach the two-year mark
*14:53.660- 14:55.600* :  of this horrific massacre tomorrow.
*14:56.280- 14:57.220* :  Lelea Luciana.
*14:59.520- 15:00.780* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*15:01.380- 15:02.880* :  Carlos Camus Procione, país.
*15:03.680- 15:05.980* :  This isn't just a treasure with economic value.
*15:06.100- 15:08.620* :  It's more than that. It has cultural importance.
*15:09.240- 15:12.660* :  Colombia seals off the site of an 18th-century warship
*15:12.980- 15:14.640* :  which went down, loaded with treasure.
*15:22.880- 15:24.580* :  It's that time of the year.
*15:25.060- 15:26.820* :  You're a vacation is coming up.
*15:27.460- 15:29.600* :  You can already hear the beach waves.
*15:29.600- 15:35.660* :  Feel the warm breeze, relax, and think about work.

*16:30.520- 16:31.280* :  Now to Mexico.
*16:36.180- 16:39.860* :  The moment just after a stage collapsed at an election event
*16:39.860- 16:42.800* :  causing panic as people scrambled to escape.
*16:43.320- 16:46.080* :  At least nine people were killed and dozens more hurt
*16:46.080- 16:48.620* :  as a heavy storm tore through the stage.
*16:49.220- 16:52.160* :  A presidential candidate, Jorge Alvarez Minas,
*16:52.480- 16:54.080* :  was on stage as it collapsed.
*16:57.320- 16:59.720* :  It was a freak event because normally the weather
*16:59.720- 17:02.200* :  gives some warning as it intensifies.
*17:03.000- 17:06.020* :  But what we experienced happened in just a few seconds.
*17:06.680- 17:10.100* :  A gale came, a sudden wind, and it collapsed the stage,
*17:10.640- 17:12.340* :  resulting in a fatal accident.
*17:12.900- 17:16.500* :  Our correspondent David Willis has been monitoring events from Los Angeles.
*17:17.500- 17:20.720* :  This incident occurred at a baseball field
*17:21.540- 17:25.860* :  near the northern Mexico City of Monterey.
*17:26.440- 17:30.620* :  High winds are thought to have caused part of the stage
*17:30.620- 17:35.680* :  that was accommodating a rally for Mexico's centrist
*17:36.060- 17:39.840* :  citizens movement party to collapse.
*17:39.840- 17:44.260* :  Now, harrowing video footage posted to social media
*17:45.020- 17:50.360* :  shows that party's presidential candidate, Jorge Alvarez Minas,
*17:51.140- 17:55.400* :  waving to his chanting and cheering supporters
*17:56.100- 18:00.500* :  and then running for safety as a giant screen
*18:00.680- 18:04.540* :  and other parts of the structure toppled over.
*18:04.760- 18:09.280* :  Now, Mr. Minas and several members of his campaign team
*18:09.720- 18:13.680* :  were taken to hospital but subsequently released.
*18:13.680- 18:18.220* :  There are unconfirmed reports that some people were buried
*18:18.740- 18:21.380* :  after the structure toppled over.
*18:22.040- 18:25.040* :  Now, Mr. Minas, who's 38 years old,
*18:25.040- 18:30.000* :  is currently at third place in the presidential polls
*18:30.820- 18:34.860* :  some way behind the leading candidate, Claudia Steinbaum,
*18:34.860- 18:39.540* :  who is the former mayor of Mexico City and a member
*18:39.920- 18:43.080* :  of the Morena Party of Mexico.
*18:43.840- 18:44.720* :  That was David Willis.
*18:45.880- 18:50.480* :  In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces rounded up and killed
*18:50.480- 18:53.500* :  some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys
*18:53.940- 18:55.580* :  in the small town of Srebrenica.
*18:56.100- 18:58.400* :  Many see it as the worst single atrocity in Europe
*18:58.760- 19:00.080* :  since the Second World War.
*19:00.800- 19:03.560* :  Now the UN is preparing to vote on a resolution
*19:04.060- 19:06.500* :  which calls for an annual international day
*19:06.860- 19:08.380* :  to mark the Srebrenica massacre.
*19:09.180- 19:11.900* :  But the resolution, backed by Germany and Rwanda,
*19:12.240- 19:15.040* :  countries with dark histories of genocide of their own,
*19:15.560- 19:18.400* :  faces opposition from Serbians and Bosnian Serbs,
*19:18.700- 19:20.380* :  including the Serbian Orthodox Church.
*19:21.060- 19:23.760* :  Bells rang out as churches joined the protest.
*19:30.100- 19:32.180* :  Our Balkans correspondent, Guida Lorne,
*19:32.180- 19:35.080* :  told us more about what happened in Srebrenica.
*19:35.920- 19:38.740* :  Well, it was the single worst day of the conflicts
*19:38.740- 19:41.700* :  that broke out during the implosion
*19:41.920- 19:44.120* :  of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
*19:44.280- 19:49.400* :  The Dutch UN battalion, which had been protecting Bosnian
*19:49.400- 19:51.740* :  Muslims in and around Srebrenica,
*19:52.240- 19:55.820* :  were, in essence, overwhelmed by Bosnian Serb forces.
*19:56.140- 19:58.800* :  And at the time, those Bosnian Serb forces said
*19:58.800- 20:01.780* :  they meant no harm to the people that had been under
*20:01.780- 20:03.600* :  the protection of the United Nations,
*20:04.120- 20:06.440* :  but they very swiftly divided them between
*20:06.440- 20:08.300* :  men and boys and women.
*20:08.300- 20:10.980* :  And many of these men and boys were taken away
*20:11.500- 20:12.380* :  never seen again.
*20:12.380- 20:15.060* :  They were massacred in several different locations
*20:15.680- 20:17.520* :  over the course of not just the 11th of July,
*20:17.520- 20:19.780* :  but a couple of the following days as well.
*20:20.340- 20:23.460* :  And people have been trying to find justice
*20:23.460- 20:27.540* :  and find reconciliation and find some sort of closure ever since.
*20:28.280- 20:33.060* :  And this UN resolution is about creating an international day
*20:33.180- 20:34.360* :  to mark the Serbrenica.
*20:35.960- 20:38.240* :  Tell us more about the protests against that idea,
*20:38.240- 20:39.680* :  particularly by the Orthodox Church.
*20:41.280- 20:43.940* :  Well, it's a day that's meant to be a day of remembrance
*20:43.940- 20:47.000* :  for victims of the genocide at Srebrenica.
*20:47.000- 20:48.320* :  It specifically says genocide.
*20:49.000- 20:52.440* :  And it's worth noting that because people have been found guilty
*20:52.980- 20:56.060* :  at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
*20:56.120- 20:58.360* :  in the hague of the offence of genocide.
*20:58.360- 21:01.860* :  That includes Raccoon Ladich, the former military chief
*21:01.860- 21:04.260* :  of the Bosnian Serbs, and right of Ankara,
*21:04.260- 21:05.660* :  which is the political leader.
*21:06.100- 21:07.960* :  Now, they've been held individually responsible.
*21:07.980- 21:12.760* :  But what you've got in Serbia over and over again over the years
*21:12.760- 21:17.000* :  is politicians who talk about people trying to find Serbia
*21:17.000- 21:20.020* :  and Serbians collectively responsible for genocide.
*21:20.640- 21:23.080* :  Now, this resolution isn't saying that at all,
*21:23.460- 21:25.620* :  but nonetheless, it's being used by politicians
*21:25.620- 21:28.900* :  in Republic of Srebskar, which is the majority Serb part of Bosnia
*21:29.300- 21:30.680* :  and Italy in Serbia itself,
*21:31.100- 21:33.520* :  to claim, really, that people around the world
*21:33.520- 21:35.020* :  have got it in for them somehow.
*21:35.520- 21:37.880* :  And the Orthodox Church, which is very close
*21:37.900- 21:39.880* :  to the Serbian government, is joining in,
*21:39.880- 21:42.360* :  ringing those bells, patriarch Porfiria,
*21:42.700- 21:45.820* :  calling the faithful people to prayer to go on
*21:45.820- 21:48.180* :  and do good despite completely false
*21:48.180- 21:51.900* :  and unjust accusations to which the Serbian people
*21:51.900- 21:53.520* :  are exposed in the United Nations.
*21:54.300- 21:55.300* :  That was Guida Lorne.
*21:56.420- 22:01.120* :  President Macron has flown 17,000 kilometers to New Caledonia
*22:01.440- 22:03.260* :  to take personal control of the crisis
*22:03.520- 22:04.980* :  in the French Pacific territory,
*22:05.520- 22:06.880* :  which is under a state of emergency.
*22:07.700- 22:09.900* :  Six people, including two police officers,
*22:09.900- 22:11.360* :  have been killed in unrest,
*22:11.360- 22:14.240* :  started by pro-independence groups angry
*22:14.240- 22:15.640* :  at French government plans
*22:15.640- 22:19.120* :  to widen voting rights to more non-native people.
*22:19.120- 22:22.760* :  Mr. Macron said extra police deployed from France
*22:22.760- 22:24.700* :  would stay as long as necessary.
*22:29.380- 22:31.880* :  My wish here, with the ministers and the government,
*22:32.420- 22:34.380* :  is to be at the side of the population,
*22:34.920- 22:36.660* :  so that as quickly as possible,
*22:36.860- 22:40.240* :  we have the return of peace, calm, and security.
*22:40.980- 22:42.240* :  That's the main priority.
*22:43.080- 22:44.280* :  There have long been tensions
*22:44.280- 22:46.200* :  between the central government in Paris
*22:46.200- 22:48.840* :  and indigenous canaks who make up 40%
*22:48.840- 22:51.140* :  of the population of New Caledonia.
*22:51.580- 22:53.780* :  Our correspondent in the region is Katie Watson.
*22:54.520- 22:56.660* :  It's going to be an incredibly hard visit
*22:56.660- 22:57.980* :  for the time he's got there.
*22:57.980- 23:00.480* :  Now, he said he wants to try and bring some
*23:00.660- 23:01.740* :  peace and stability.
*23:01.740- 23:05.060* :  He also wants to acknowledge the economic challenges.
*23:05.060- 23:06.260* :  It's a country hard hit
*23:06.260- 23:08.460* :  by difficult economic situation
*23:08.520- 23:09.460* :  the last few years.
*23:09.880- 23:11.140* :  But I think his biggest challenge
*23:11.400- 23:13.260* :  will be the political challenge,
*23:13.300- 23:16.420* :  trying to talk about a future for New Caledonia,
*23:16.420- 23:19.860* :  bring two sides who are very far apart together
*23:19.860- 23:23.420* :  and try and work on moving on from the unrest
*23:23.600- 23:25.660* :  that we've seen hit the country
*23:25.660- 23:27.380* :  in the last, what, nearly two weeks.
*23:27.820- 23:29.200* :  And just looking at that unrest,
*23:29.200- 23:31.300* :  remind us what was it that triggered it?
*23:31.420- 23:33.500* :  Why are these various groups so angry?
*23:33.780- 23:36.780* :  So what triggered it was a debate in Parliament in France
*23:37.320- 23:40.200* :  to allow French people who've been living
*23:40.200- 23:42.520* :  in New Caledonia for about a decade
*23:42.520- 23:44.920* :  to be able to take part in local elections.
*23:45.580- 23:47.500* :  But the concern from indigenous canaks
*23:47.840- 23:50.500* :  is that that will dilute their political influence.
*23:50.680- 23:52.180* :  And this goes back a long way.
*23:52.180- 23:54.260* :  This isn't a tension that's just started.
*23:54.680- 23:57.360* :  Back in 1998, there was the Numea Accord
*23:57.360- 23:59.940* :  that was drawn up, which basically set New Caledonia
*23:59.940- 24:02.040* :  towards a path of more autonomy,
*24:02.640- 24:04.800* :  more political power for indigenous canaks.
*24:05.180- 24:06.820* :  And in that, there were referendums as well
*24:06.820- 24:07.500* :  that were tabled.
*24:07.500- 24:08.740* :  There were three referendums.
*24:09.020- 24:11.720* :  The first two were quite a narrow majority,
*24:11.720- 24:14.100* :  but it was a majority to remain French.
*24:14.140- 24:16.800* :  And then in 2021, in the wake of COVID,
*24:16.800- 24:19.640* :  there was another one that pro-independence leaders
*24:19.640- 24:21.880* :  they boycotted, they said that it was rushed through.
*24:22.300- 24:24.260* :  Therefore, that's kind of set the tone of tension
*24:24.280- 24:25.420* :  in the last few years.
*24:25.580- 24:28.000* :  The concern is that France is basically trying
*24:28.000- 24:31.100* :  to take on perhaps too much power and influence
*24:31.600- 24:33.080* :  when a large group of people
*24:33.080- 24:34.540* :  that would like more independence from France.
*24:34.820- 24:36.820* :  As you say, the tension hasn't just started.
*24:37.140- 24:39.020* :  Some of those have suggested that Mr. Macron
*24:39.020- 24:41.280* :  and his government should have anticipated the trouble.
*24:41.880- 24:43.520* :  I think everybody I have spoken to,
*24:43.520- 24:46.080* :  who's an expert in the region has said exactly that,
*24:46.500- 24:48.280* :  that trying to push through this vote,
*24:48.280- 24:50.900* :  which a lot of people say doesn't fit with the Numea Accord
*24:50.900- 24:53.340* :  and the view of trying to become more autonomous.
*24:53.780- 24:54.540* :  But at the same time,
*24:54.540- 24:57.760* :  Macron has made very clear that he wants to have more influence
*24:57.760- 24:58.600* :  in the region.
*24:58.980- 25:00.700* :  And so that goes against, obviously,
*25:00.700- 25:02.180* :  that push for more independence.
*25:02.640- 25:05.480* :  But I think the fact that it was debated in Parliament,
*25:05.480- 25:06.940* :  I don't think, came as any surprise
*25:06.940- 25:09.140* :  that this sort of reaction came about it.
*25:09.180- 25:10.340* :  So now that's the biggest challenge,
*25:10.340- 25:12.180* :  is to try and bridge that divide
*25:12.180- 25:14.280* :  and bring New Caledonia together again.
*25:14.840- 25:15.420* :  Katie Watson.
*25:16.160- 25:18.640* :  In France itself, police have arrested a man
*25:18.640- 25:21.100* :  who they say they believe was planning an attack
*25:21.100- 25:23.720* :  during the Olympic torch relay in Bordeaux.
*25:23.980- 25:25.420* :  Husco Field reports from Paris.
*25:26.140- 25:28.800* :  The 26-year-old named only as Alex G,
*25:29.240- 25:32.040* :  posted a message online in support of the so-called
*25:32.040- 25:34.220* :  Insel Killer, Elliot Roger,
*25:34.580- 25:37.200* :  who 10 years ago murdered six people in California,
*25:37.620- 25:40.960* :  citing his hatred of women and inability to get a girlfriend.
*25:40.960- 25:44.240* :  This was picked up by an interior ministry agency
*25:44.240- 25:46.660* :  which monitors online extremism.
*25:47.060- 25:49.220* :  According to police quoted in the French media,
*25:49.220- 25:52.500* :  on his arrest, the man admitted planning an attack,
*25:52.500- 25:55.180* :  though without giving detail of time or place.
*25:55.180- 25:58.100* :  It was the interior minister, Gerard Dharmaner,
*25:58.180- 26:00.380* :  who said in a message on Twitter X
*26:00.660- 26:02.560* :  that the police had foiled a planned attack
*26:02.940- 26:04.680* :  during the passage of the Olympic flame
*26:04.680- 26:06.660* :  on Thursday in Bordeaux.
*26:06.960- 26:10.500* :  Telephones and a non-lethal self-defense revolver
*26:10.760- 26:11.980* :  were found at the man's home.
*26:12.760- 26:13.500* :  Husco Field.
*26:14.680- 26:17.080* :  And we end this edition of the Global News podcast
*26:17.080- 26:20.180* :  with the story of an 18th century Spanish warship.
*26:20.700- 26:23.960* :  Rather more than 300 years ago, the ship known as the San Jose
*26:23.960- 26:25.860* :  was attacked by a British warship
*26:26.040- 26:27.400* :  off the coast of South America.
*26:27.840- 26:29.940* :  The San Jose sank to the bottom of the sea,
*26:29.940- 26:32.980* :  taking with it treasure now worth billions of dollars.
*26:33.640- 26:35.540* :  Nine years ago, the wreck was rediscovered,
*26:35.540- 26:38.540* :  sparking another battle this time over who owned it,
*26:38.920- 26:40.960* :  and more crucially, the treasure on board.
*26:41.380- 26:43.360* :  Now the Colombian government has declared the site
*26:43.360- 26:45.380* :  protected archaeological area,
*26:45.960- 26:47.000* :  Elabectora Fords.
*26:49.200- 26:52.300* :  For more than 300 years, the location of the San Jose
*26:52.300- 26:55.500* :  was unknown, thought to be in David Jones' locker,
*26:55.920- 26:57.920* :  lost in an oceanic abyss.
*26:58.340- 27:00.820* :  It was a 64-gun three-master galleon,
*27:00.820- 27:02.960* :  a mainstay of the Spanish Armada.
*27:03.240- 27:06.260* :  That was until it was sunk by the British in 1708
*27:06.260- 27:08.520* :  off the coast of what is now Colombia.
*27:09.180- 27:11.860* :  On board 600 sailors and a treasure trove
*27:11.860- 27:13.620* :  of gold, silver and emeralds,
*27:13.960- 27:16.800* :  as well as 11 million pesos in coins.
*27:17.400- 27:20.080* :  The wreck and its treasure found in 2015
*27:20.080- 27:22.960* :  are estimated to be worth billions of dollars,
*27:23.560- 27:25.060* :  which is why it's been embroiled
*27:25.060- 27:27.260* :  in legal disputes over ownership.
*27:27.800- 27:29.720* :  Spain insisted the bounty was its,
*27:29.980- 27:31.420* :  since it was a Spanish warship
*27:31.420- 27:33.600* :  and Spanish soldiers lost its sea.
*27:33.900- 27:36.200* :  But believers' indigenous car coronation
*27:36.480- 27:37.880* :  say the treasure belongs to them,
*27:37.880- 27:40.920* :  as their ancestors were forced to mind the precious metals.
*27:41.560- 27:44.020* :  Even an American salvage company wants a piece,
*27:44.420- 27:45.960* :  claiming it first spotted the vessel
*27:45.960- 27:47.600* :  more than 40 years ago.
*27:50.280- 27:52.540* :  This isn't just a treasure with economic value,
*27:52.880- 27:53.660* :  it's more than that.
*27:53.920- 27:55.180* :  It has cultural importance.
*27:56.580- 27:59.280* :  That's Colombia's minister of culture, Juan Carrera,
*27:59.600- 28:02.020* :  who says the discovery has been marred by greed,
*28:02.020- 28:06.560* :  today declaring a protected archaeological area around the site.
*28:06.980- 28:11.600* :  This galleon signifies a crossing of cultures,
*28:12.220- 28:13.140* :  history and memories,
*28:13.140- 28:15.440* :  which includes the original people of Latin America.
*28:16.140- 28:18.000* :  And also, the genocide that happened there,
*28:18.460- 28:20.720* :  the enslaving of thousands and thousands of people,
*28:21.160- 28:23.580* :  human beings, who were brought here from Africa
*28:24.080- 28:25.660* :  under the worst conditions imaginable.
*28:26.280- 28:29.780* :  Next, Colombia will hope to launch a deep water expedition
*28:29.780- 28:32.220* :  involving a remotely operated robot
*28:32.720- 28:34.960* :  diving to the depths of 600 meters,
*28:34.960- 28:38.080* :  taking photos of the wreckage for scientific research.
*28:38.840- 28:41.160* :  Scientists say they have no plans to take samples,
*28:41.160- 28:44.060* :  promising a non-invasive operation.
*28:44.640- 28:46.060* :  Any salvage will come later.
*28:46.560- 28:48.760* :  For now, the treasure will stay buried.
*28:49.720- 28:50.960* :  And that was Ella Bignol.
*28:53.500- 28:54.560* :  And that's it from us for now,
*28:54.560- 28:57.400* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*29:10.280- 29:12.560* :  This edition was mixed by Julian Farmer.
*29:12.760- 29:14.040* :  The producer was Anna Murphy.

*29:27.880- 29:30.180* :  Why don't more infant formula companies use organic,
*29:30.180- 29:32.200* :  grass-fed whole milk instead of skin?
*29:32.940- 29:34.480* :  Why don't more infant formula companies
*29:34.480- 29:36.440* :  use the latest breast milk science?
*29:37.280- 29:38.660* :  Why don't more infant formula companies
*29:39.020- 29:40.340* :  run their own clinical trials?
*29:41.100- 29:42.860* :  Why don't more infant formula companies use
*29:42.860- 29:44.760* :  more of the proteins found in breast milk?
*29:45.420- 29:48.000* :  Why don't more infant formula companies have their own factories
*29:48.300- 29:50.100* :  instead of outsourcing their manufacturing?
*29:50.820- 29:52.120* :  We wondered the same thing.
*29:52.540- 29:55.100* :  So we made by heart a better formula for formula.
