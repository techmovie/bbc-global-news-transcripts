*01:23.040- 01:29.600* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Wednesday 8th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:30.280- 01:33.960* :  Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the centre of Donald Trump's criminal trial,
*01:34.140- 01:37.200* :  tells the court about their alleged sexual encounter.
*01:38.100- 01:42.240* :  Israel has said it will continue its attack on Raffa in southern Gaza until
*01:42.240- 01:46.800* :  Hamas is defeated or the first of the remaining hostages is released.
*01:47.680- 01:51.440* :  Tiktok is suing the US government over its move to ban the app if it's
*01:51.440- 01:54.060* :  Chinese owners don't agree to sell it.
*01:56.840- 01:57.660* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:02.640- 02:06.720* :  one of the biggest music events of the year has kicked off in Sweden with the first
*02:06.720- 02:09.640* :  Eurovision Song Contest semi-final.
*02:14.540- 02:19.700* :  Donald Trump's hush money trial has been hearing evidence from the porn star at the centre of
*02:19.700- 02:22.800* :  the case in one of the most riveting days of testimony.
*02:23.380- 02:28.120* :  Sitting just meters from Mr. Trump in a New York courtroom, Stormy Daniels described the
*02:28.120- 02:32.280* :  sexual encounter she says they had, sometimes in graphic detail.
*02:32.980- 02:38.840* :  He denies any such encounter occurred and has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records
*02:38.840- 02:46.460* :  to conceal a payment of $130,000 to buy the porn star's silence ahead of the 2016 presidential
*02:46.460- 02:51.660* :  election. On North America editor Sarah Smith sent this report from outside the court.
*02:52.320- 02:55.060* :  This is the moment much of the world's media has been waiting for.
*02:55.440- 02:59.760* :  Stormy Daniels in the witness box, the US networks are very excited.
*03:00.580- 03:04.300* :  And with that we do want to switch to some breaking news out of New York right now.
*03:04.300- 03:09.760* :  The attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels says she herself is expected to appear
*03:10.300- 03:13.900* :  as a witness in the Trump hush money fraud trial today.
*03:14.160- 03:19.280* :  The details that are being described in front of this jury are quite explicit.
*03:19.280- 03:26.100* :  Having Stormy Daniels say that she took a rolled up magazine and spanked Donald Trump in the butt.
*03:26.400- 03:32.520* :  Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 by Donald Trump to keep quiet and now she's telling her story
*03:32.520- 03:37.940* :  in court, including her claim vehemently denied by Mr. Trump that they had a sexual encounter.
*03:42.240- 03:45.740* :  The former president ignored report his questions as he moved around the court house.
*03:46.400- 03:50.240* :  She arrived in court modestly dressed in a long black dress and wearing glasses.
*03:50.920- 03:55.400* :  Mr. Trump was watching. His expression at times uninterested at times annoyed and she
*03:55.400- 03:59.720* :  described her career. And he seemed to look down when she was asked to identify him in court.
*04:00.220- 04:04.440* :  A photo of the two of them together was shown to the court taken when they first met at a golf
*04:04.440- 04:09.640* :  tournament in 2006. Ms. Daniels described how her bodyguard invited her to have dinner with Mr.
*04:09.640- 04:13.920* :  Trump and she said when she got to his hotel suite she made fun of him for wearing black silk
*04:13.920- 04:19.060* :  pajamas. When the prosecution asked Ms. Daniels about having sex with Mr. Trump she was frequently
*04:19.060- 04:23.880* :  interrupted by objections from his lawyers. Did you at some point end up on the bed having
*04:23.880- 04:28.960* :  sex with him she was asked? Yes, replied Stormy Daniels going into some detail. The judge appeared
*04:28.960- 04:33.640* :  unhappy about the length of her answers and the level of detail telling her to just answer the
*04:33.640- 04:37.380* :  questions while Donald Trump seemed to be fidgeting restlessly as he listened.
*04:38.200- 04:43.440* :  Earlier, Mr. Trump posted on social media. I've just recently been told who the witnesses today
*04:43.440- 04:49.160* :  this is unprecedented no time for lawyers to prepare. He then quickly deleted it. He's already
*04:49.160- 04:54.060* :  been warned by the judge. He could be jailed if he continues to post about witnesses in this trial.
*04:54.580- 05:00.020* :  Sarah Smith. Let's turn now to events in the Middle East. For more than a million Palestinians
*05:00.020- 05:05.280* :  fleeing the war in Gaza the southernmost city of Rafa has become their last refuge.
*05:06.040- 05:11.200* :  Now Israel has threatened to expand its military operation in Rafa after its troops
*05:11.200- 05:16.900* :  seized the main border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Israel defied months of international
*05:16.900- 05:22.160* :  pressure to launch a ground offensive in Rafa on Monday hours after Hamas said it had accepted
*05:22.160- 05:27.540* :  a proposal for a ceasefire deal. The Israeli Prime Minister rejected this but at the same time
*05:27.540- 05:33.660* :  dispatched a team of negotiators to Cairo to continue talks. With the Rafa crossing and another
*05:33.660- 05:39.420* :  one at Kerim Shalom closed, aid agencies now say it's nearly impossible to bring in supplies
*05:39.420- 05:45.680* :  for Palestinian civilians. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged Israel to re-open both
*05:45.680- 05:50.540* :  crossings and warn that a full-scale assault on Rafa would be a disaster.
*05:51.460- 05:56.120* :  After more than when thousands went and then Israel is killed in the Hamas terror attacks of
*05:56.120- 06:03.020* :  7 October, after more than 34,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, even to be seen enough,
*06:04.200- 06:11.740* :  even civilian suffered enough death and destruction, make no mistake. A full-scale assault on Rafa
*06:12.660- 06:18.980* :  would be a human catastrophe. But Israel says it will continue its attack on Rafa until Hamas
*06:18.980- 06:25.420* :  is defeated or the first of its remaining hostages is released. David Mensa, a spokesman for the
*06:25.420- 06:30.820* :  Israeli government, explained why it's not allowing humanitarian workers access to the Rafa crossing.
*06:31.420- 06:37.420* :  Our intelligence has clearly shown that the Rafa crossing in particular with Egypt in eastern
*06:37.420- 06:43.560* :  Rafa has been used for terrorist purposes. Our troops have now obtained operational control
*06:43.560- 06:50.780* :  of the gars inside of the crossing. Now underneath that large border infrastructure are cross-border
*06:50.780- 06:59.060* :  underground smuggling tunnels, sustaining and providing a lifeline to Hamas. These Hamas tunnels
*06:59.060- 07:06.020* :  must be dealt with. After Israel's order to evacuate parts of eastern Rafa, tens of thousands of
*07:06.020- 07:11.480* :  people have been weirdly packing up whatever possessions they can carry. As Israel carries out
*07:11.480- 07:14.520* :  attacks, it says are aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.
*07:15.500- 07:21.740* :  Rada Al-Hadad works for the aid organization Oxfam in Gaza. We are tired and exhausted because
*07:21.740- 07:27.060* :  we don't know where to go. All of the places have been hit. There are ongoing
*07:27.060- 07:34.420* :  earthquakes and non-stop artillery shillings everywhere in Gaza. So the pressing question in
*07:34.420- 07:41.320* :  everyone's mind is where do we go? Where to find a safer place for ourselves, for our children
*07:41.320- 07:47.100* :  and for our family members? I asked Frank Gardner in Jerusalem how long he thought the two
*07:47.100- 07:52.620* :  border crossings into Gaza would remain closed? Well everyone's hoping that it's a temporary closure
*07:53.500- 07:59.100* :  and it's absolutely the last thing that garsons and aid agencies need because these are the two
*07:59.100- 08:05.120* :  main arteries for getting aid into the territory. There are other crossing points but these are
*08:05.120- 08:13.180* :  the main ones. The blame for this falls on both Israel and Hamas. Few days ago, Hamas carried out a
*08:13.180- 08:18.740* :  deadly rocket strike on the Israeli side of the Kerim Shalom crossing point. Now that's the main
*08:18.740- 08:25.980* :  cargo crossing point right down at the bottom southeast corner of the Gaza Strip and it had been
*08:25.980- 08:32.300* :  shot. The US, Britain and other countries had pressured Israel to open it almost as soon as it
*08:32.300- 08:36.700* :  was open and only a few days ago, Anthony Blinken, the US Secretary of State was down there to
*08:36.700- 08:43.140* :  visit it. They rocketed it so Israel shut it. Since then Israel has warned around 100,000
*08:43.140- 08:47.720* :  garsons residents, not really residents. They're displaced people who've already been moved
*08:47.720- 08:54.700* :  from their homes in north of the Gaza Strip to evacuate Eastern Ruffa to areas that they say are
*08:54.700- 09:01.340* :  safe or safer but which aid agencies say are completely unsuitable for them. It's really grim for
*09:01.340- 09:06.740* :  that population. With them evacuated, Israel has been pushing tanks infantry in artillery and
*09:06.740- 09:13.260* :  carrying out airstrikes in the Eastern Ruffa area of the border. It's stopping just short of it
*09:13.260- 09:18.760* :  being a major military operation which the US has said it would veto but nevertheless it is a
*09:18.760- 09:23.920* :  military operation. People are being killed. Israel says it's finding tunnels and killing fighters
*09:24.380- 09:28.980* :  and it's raised its flag on the Palestinian side of the Ruffa border. There is some discussion
*09:29.260- 09:34.700* :  about whether the removal of a Palestinian checkpoint on the gars inside of the border
*09:35.200- 09:39.280* :  will now be permanent that there's going to be some kind of possibly even a private security
*09:39.280- 09:44.620* :  company taking over the management of that checkpoint. And we know that Israel is sending
*09:44.620- 09:50.160* :  a delegation to Cairo, not a high level delegation, despite the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister
*09:50.160- 09:55.180* :  Benjamin Netanyahu says the Hamas ceasefire proposal falls well short. Do we know what Israel
*09:55.180- 10:02.500* :  is unhappy about? We do. It's about a ceasefire. Is it going to be permanent? Hamas do not want to
*10:02.500- 10:07.660* :  sign up to a deal that doesn't include a full and final ceasefire. They don't want to hand over
*10:07.660- 10:13.480* :  their prime bargaining chip which are the hostages to Israel and then the very next day once they've
*10:13.480- 10:18.480* :  handed the last one over, they undergo a massive military assault that wipes them out. Leaving
*10:18.480- 10:23.640* :  aside the fact that they are a prescribed terrorist organization by many countries that makes no
*10:23.640- 10:29.820* :  sense to them, Israel's view is they're not going to sign up to a deal that leaves Hamas intact.
*10:30.740- 10:36.160* :  Frank Gardner, the hugely popular social media platform TikTok and its Chinese parent company
*10:36.160- 10:41.200* :  Bite Dance have filed a lawsuit against the US government. They're challenging a law that would
*10:41.200- 10:47.520* :  force a sale or a ban of the app. An ortho-america correspondent Gary O'Donohue says it has a vast
*10:47.520- 10:53.780* :  number of users both in the United States and across the world. Well in terms of the US 170
*10:53.780- 11:01.120* :  million users and the US population now is around the 340 million marks. About half of people in
*11:01.120- 11:07.660* :  the United States have it on their devices. It's skews to the younger generation. It's skews to
*11:07.660- 11:14.820* :  women in particular but it's a huge thing here and of course that's reflected worldwide. It's in
*11:14.820- 11:23.080* :  130 countries, multiple languages, about a billion users around the planet. But the Biden administration
*11:23.100- 11:28.460* :  also thinks it's a national security threat. Yeah in fact it's not just the Biden administration
*11:28.500- 11:33.340* :  but kind of across one of those issues which seems to have gone across the political divide.
*11:33.340- 11:38.660* :  Unusually for this country at the moment there's sort of bipartisan support for this idea that
*11:39.140- 11:45.920* :  not only is TikTok a potential threat to national security but the data of US citizens,
*11:45.920- 11:52.120* :  people believe politicians believe is at risk because of its Chinese ownership and the nature
*11:52.720- 11:59.360* :  of the CCP's control over businesses in China, even privately owned businesses like Bite Dance
*11:59.360- 12:04.540* :  which is its parent company. Also I think there's some concerns about the influence it might have
*12:04.540- 12:10.480* :  in an election year we're in. Over the last few years TikTok's sort of content is broad and
*12:10.480- 12:15.540* :  significantly so no longer are people just watching funny dancing videos on it. They're looking
*12:15.540- 12:21.740* :  for their news on it too. But Bite Dance the parent company is now fighting back and it could
*12:21.740- 12:27.720* :  argue that it's being singled out because it is Chinese owned whereas other social media platforms
*12:27.720- 12:33.620* :  that have also raised similar concerns are not being punished by the US administration.
*12:35.060- 12:38.800* :  Yeah and I think the the administration in Congress have been pretty clear that it's because
*12:38.800- 12:45.660* :  it's Chinese owned that there is a concern and yes their argument focuses particularly on some
*12:45.660- 12:50.500* :  of the constitutional elements. They say that this is a huge breach of the First Amendment,
*12:50.500- 12:55.960* :  the free speech amendment in the American Constitution and they have had some success in other
*12:55.960- 13:01.680* :  lower courts elsewhere around the country with sort of local attempts to ban them in making
*13:01.680- 13:06.960* :  that argument and it is a very powerful argument. It's it's difficult to explain to people around
*13:06.960- 13:12.880* :  the world how the the First Amendment, the free speech amendment is very very dear to the courts
*13:12.880- 13:18.800* :  in America and so I think this is something that will maybe start in the courts of the district
*13:18.800- 13:23.620* :  of Columbia where they've lodged this case but it could easily end up in the in the Supreme Court
*13:23.620- 13:30.120* :  at some point in the future. Gary O'Donohue. Britain has warned about the dangers posed by
*13:30.120- 13:35.460* :  cyber attacks from hostile states. The British Defence Minister Grant Shaps addressed Parliament
*13:35.460- 13:41.820* :  about a hack of the armed forces payroll system. While he didn't identify a specific culprit,
*13:41.820- 13:47.040* :  the BBC understands the government suspects China of being behind the date of reach.
*13:47.480- 13:52.460* :  With more he is our security correspondent Gordon Carrera. Members of the armed forces including
*13:52.460- 13:57.960* :  reservists and some veterans received an emailed warning them their personal data may have been
*13:57.960- 14:05.700* :  compromised. This includes names and bank details and in some cases addresses. Up to 272,000 people
*14:05.700- 14:10.520* :  could be affected although it's not yet clear what information the cyber thieves have taken.
*14:11.260- 14:16.400* :  The breach came as the result of a hack into the systems of a contractor which provides payment
*14:16.400- 14:21.540* :  services and whose security is now being investigated. The Ministry of Defence said it was
*14:21.540- 14:25.880* :  confident that salaries would be paid although there were delays in paying expenses.
*14:26.640- 14:31.780* :  It can take the intelligence services weeks, months, even years to formally attribute a cyber attack
*14:31.780- 14:37.360* :  and blame a particular country or group. In a statement to Parliament, the Defence Secretary Grant
*14:37.360- 14:43.680* :  Shaps was careful about a portioning blame. For reasons of national security we can't release further
*14:43.680- 14:50.900* :  details of the suspected cyber activity behind this incident. However, I can confirm to the House
*14:51.760- 14:58.540* :  that we do have indications that this was the suspected work of a malign actor and we cannot
*14:58.540- 15:05.520* :  rule out state involvement. In this case suspicion centre on China partly based on a track record
*15:05.520- 15:13.160* :  of similar activity. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman described claims
*15:13.160- 15:18.600* :  China was involved as absurd and a smear and said it opposed all forms of cyber attacks.
*15:18.620- 15:24.240* :  It may take time to be confident who was responsible and that will do little to help those in the
*15:24.240- 15:28.700* :  armed forces worried about what's happened to their data. Gordon Carrera.

*17:02.640- 17:07.900* :  Rescuers in South Africa are racing against time to find more than 40 people who are missing
*17:07.900- 17:11.340* :  after a five-story apartment building collapsed on Monday.
*17:11.420- 17:14.400* :  At least seven people are confirmed to have died.
*17:14.900- 17:18.680* :  Rescuers in the southern coastal city of George managed to find some people
*17:18.680- 17:22.200* :  but were trying to reach 11 survivors they could hear in the ruins,
*17:22.940- 17:28.080* :  including four trapped in the basement. The building was still under construction when it collapsed.
*17:28.660- 17:31.900* :  Emergency workers are taking it in turns to work on the site,
*17:31.900- 17:37.760* :  removing concrete blocks and debris by hand. James Reynolds spoke to Maria Ferrero from the
*17:37.760- 17:41.920* :  gift of the giver disaster relief group at the site with his rescue sniffer dogs.
*17:42.340- 17:43.360* :  He described the scene.
*17:43.860- 17:48.460* :  What I see around me is enormous amount of emergency vehicles,
*17:49.240- 17:54.700* :  construction equipment, cranes, people, basically rescue workers,
*17:55.320- 17:58.120* :  these medical teams on site doctors,
*17:58.860- 18:07.020* :  these people that's basically standing in the distance with a hope of a family member getting
*18:07.340- 18:13.720* :  taken alive out on the concrete jungle and it looks like a dump site of concrete
*18:14.340- 18:19.540* :  where the scaffolding intertwined basically through it.
*18:19.760- 18:21.600* :  Tell us about the rescue work you're doing, please.
*18:22.140- 18:25.200* :  Well, we've got three sniffer dogs on site.
*18:25.760- 18:31.720* :  We've basically are supplying some essential needs for the rescue workers,
*18:32.480- 18:37.100* :  the family members of the people that he's captured, that strong blankets to food,
*18:37.920- 18:43.080* :  items to equipment to be used with the rescue service.
*18:43.700- 18:50.700* :  We are coordinating with the communities of the area which is also coming forward very much
*18:50.700- 18:55.840* :  to assist. So, yeah, we basically with the need arrived,
*18:56.300- 19:03.980* :  we there to try and hold that need and so far we ate people on site from our team
*19:04.700- 19:10.480* :  plus the three dogs. We've got soup kitchens going over here on site, we've got soup kitchens
*19:10.520- 19:18.280* :  going in town where people are preparing meals on a constant basis just to have hot meals for the
*19:18.540- 19:23.620* :  guys. Tell us about the skills, the abilities of the sniffer dogs and how important they are for you.
*19:23.880- 19:29.360* :  If you imagine a five story building basically collapsing,
*19:30.080- 19:38.640* :  it's five floors down on top of his other is being over 75 construction workers basically
*19:39.500- 19:45.660* :  within the building when this happened. The sniffer dogs basically, I mean if you look at this
*19:45.760- 19:50.840* :  this pile of rubble that lies here, you can't see people, you can't see people,
*19:51.540- 20:00.020* :  so it's essential that we make use of that senses of that dog that trained sniffer dogs to actually
*20:00.020- 20:09.140* :  pick it up and so far it's been spot on every time and a lot of people have been saved and
*20:09.260- 20:14.740* :  removed from the rubble. And when you look at the wreckage, do you have a professional
*20:14.740- 20:22.920* :  assessment as to the possibility of finding survivors inside? Well if you look at the wreckage now,
*20:22.920- 20:29.540* :  you think it's impossible but I mean there's always hope and we're not going to give up.
*20:29.540- 20:35.660* :  The main thing at this site is to do the rescue mission as quickly and efficiently with as little
*20:35.660- 20:42.000* :  as possible disturbance to the wreckage of the building while typing out the people or searching
*20:42.000- 20:48.200* :  for the people. The UN's migration agency says it's ready to help dozens of migrants who were
*20:48.200- 20:52.340* :  rescued in Libya after being held captive in a house in the southeast of the country.
*20:52.880- 20:57.500* :  On Monday the authorities in the Libyan city of Benghazi said more than a hundred migrants had
*20:57.500- 21:03.340* :  been found when the hideout was raided. Some of them are reported to be in very poor health.
*21:03.680- 21:08.760* :  Well roster reports. Libya's criminal investigations department has been trying to catch the head of
*21:08.760- 21:13.660* :  a human trafficking gang in the southeastern town of Al-Qufra for some time. There are reports that
*21:13.660- 21:18.080* :  several raids only found empty buildings as the migrants were being moved from a house to house.
*21:18.080- 21:24.020* :  But now a CID spokesman says 107 people from different African countries have been rescued
*21:24.020- 21:28.200* :  from a house. They've been held for several months. There are reports that some of the migrants
*21:28.200- 21:32.480* :  showed signs of having been tortured. Libyan trafficking gangs often inflict a
*21:32.480- 21:37.400* :  pauling abuses on those they hold while trying to extort money from their families back home.
*21:38.540- 21:43.760* :  Well Ross, meanwhile far-right parties across the European Union are hoping to capitalise on
*21:43.760- 21:48.660* :  concerns about immigration and the cost of living to make big gains in next month's European
*21:48.660- 21:53.240* :  Parliament elections. On the back of those elections far-right leaders in countries like
*21:53.240- 21:58.100* :  France and Spain are hoping to emulate the Italian Prime Minister Georgian Maloney in winning
*21:58.100- 22:03.160* :  the leadership of their countries. Our correspondent Mark Lohan went to Latina just south of Rome
*22:03.440- 22:11.480* :  to look at what's worrying boat is there. Well these beasts are absolutely even harder to read
*22:11.480- 22:18.920* :  than the Italian electorate. I'm beside some of the 1800 buffaloes here at Chirche, a farm
*22:19.200- 22:25.500* :  an hour and a half south of Rome near Latina that produces buffalo cheese, mozzarella and ricotta.
*22:26.140- 22:31.540* :  They're incredibly curious beasts. They're all peering out. It's a typical Italian business run
*22:31.540- 22:38.300* :  by the same family for generations. Luigi Benedetti is corona. Globalization is a challenge because
*22:38.300- 22:44.600* :  we have products coming from other countries outside of Europe and those products are less expensive
*22:44.600- 22:50.500* :  to make and so this creates a problem on the market. Can you find Italians for your workforce easily?
*22:50.820- 22:56.680* :  It's not that easy to find workers because the medium salary in Italy is not growing
*22:56.680- 23:03.260* :  up from a long time and this is very sad because many time young university students prefer to not
*23:03.260- 23:13.920* :  work instead of working just because of this. So the farm has to turn to migrant workers to fill the
*23:13.920- 23:19.740* :  gap. No shortage there with numbers soaring at a local migrant reception center. Unaccompanied
*23:19.740- 23:25.260* :  miners here work on a puzzle of Italy putting together the pieces of their new home while a
*23:25.260- 23:32.340* :  volunteer teaches them about the cities. Seventeen-year-old Inosa Konate paid smugglers 2,000 euros to come
*23:32.340- 23:41.220* :  here from Bikina Faso. Lots of Africans think Europe is a paradise but it's not true. When I came
*23:41.220- 23:47.040* :  I saw it wasn't as I imagined and that I wouldn't find a job immediately. Now I tell people
*23:47.040- 23:52.440* :  back home to stay there but I know they will keep trying and even if Italy wants to stop the bolts
*23:52.780- 23:59.480* :  it's impossible. It's fantastic here in the kitchen where the residents of this center have been
*23:59.480- 24:06.920* :  cooking all morning. So there's in there there's chicken, what else there tomorrow. Yeah it's
*24:06.920- 24:18.860* :  there in Garot you used to have this back home. Migrant arrivals in Italy went up by 50% last year
*24:18.860- 24:24.360* :  despite the government promising to crack down and it's another election issue. Mary Fazzolo
*24:24.360- 24:29.920* :  works at the center. As soon as we have one place to places the day after we have a request for
*24:29.920- 24:35.640* :  the places it's okay for now the numbers that we were sitting now but I don't know in the future if
*24:35.640- 24:41.140* :  they could increase more if it would be okay it would be a little difficult. So you're at your
*24:41.140- 24:49.620* :  maximum point do you think? Maybe yes I think so. So this region and its capital Latina faces the
*24:49.620- 24:55.780* :  same issues as the rest of Italy. Economic stagnation, a migrant influx, a brain drain of Italians and
*24:55.780- 25:02.060* :  an aging population. It's a long to-do list for the Mayor Matilde Celentano, the first woman in charge
*25:02.060- 25:07.800* :  here from the party of Italy's first female prime minister George Melloni elected 18 months ago
*25:07.800- 25:15.260* :  and still topping the polls. The Malone government is working well. We have problems of a falling
*25:15.260- 25:20.920* :  birth rate for example which affects all of Europe. On migration we have taken important steps.
*25:21.480- 25:27.860* :  We used to passively accept migrants but now we have a big say in managing flows. It's important
*25:27.860- 25:32.660* :  that our party wins this election so we can put forward our ideas at a European level.
*25:37.160- 25:42.920* :  Back at the Buffalo farm delicious creamy cheese is churned out. It's an example of what this country
*25:42.920- 25:49.300* :  does so well but for all of Italy's marvelous sides it's age-old problems remain. What's changed
*25:49.340- 25:54.860* :  is who's trying to solve them with George Melloni now dominating politics hoping to entrench her
*25:54.860- 25:59.640* :  position with this election and increasingly seen by other right-wing leaders in Europe as a
*25:59.640- 26:06.100* :  figurehead an example of what they too hope to achieve after they lock horns with rivals in the
*26:06.100- 26:13.740* :  upcoming battle. That report from Italy by Mark Loin. One of the world's oldest men's clubs the
*26:13.740- 26:19.080* :  Garrick and London has voted to allow women to join. The change was approved at a meeting of
*26:19.080- 26:24.260* :  members on Tuesday night. The Guardian newspaper had been campaigning for women to be admitted
*26:24.260- 26:30.480* :  according the club a ballwork of Britain's male dominated establishment. James Shipham reports.
*26:31.140- 26:37.620* :  The Garrick was founded in 1831. Its membership list is kept secret but it's known to include
*26:37.620- 26:44.680* :  judges, MPs, journalists and senior figures from the arts all of the men. The club has voted on
*26:44.680- 26:49.920* :  previous occasions to block the admission of women but the publication in the Guardian of the names
*26:49.920- 26:55.400* :  of several dozen members had prompted calls for the Garrick to think again. Dozens are said to
*26:55.400- 27:00.800* :  have threatened to resign if women were not allowed to join. Hundreds of members spent two hours
*27:01.420- 27:06.100* :  discussing the issue. The motion to admit women is reported to have been approved by nearly 60%
*27:06.140- 27:13.080* :  of those present. James Shipham. The Swiss Army knife is the main tool of choice for scouts,
*27:13.080- 27:18.560* :  usually complete with versatile options such as a screwdriver, a can opener and a pocket knife.
*27:19.140- 27:23.220* :  Now the company that's been making them for more than 100 years has announced it's developing
*27:23.220- 27:29.360* :  its first bladeless model. Victoria Knox said the change was in response to an increasing number
*27:29.360- 27:34.700* :  of countries imposing tighter restrictions on carrying knives. Paul Hawkins reports.
*27:35.460- 27:41.600* :  First developed in 1891, Carl Ellsner's Swiss Army knife with an extra blade and a corkscrew
*27:41.600- 27:47.980* :  was a game changer. 133 years later millions of people swear by it including European armies,
*27:47.980- 28:00.440* :  astronauts, picnickers and the scouts. Simon Carter is a scout leader. If you're going to camp,
*28:00.440- 28:06.780* :  you need a tin oven. Quite often you need a pair of pliers, a pair of tweezers, it's got tweezers
*28:06.860- 28:11.900* :  or it's got a screwdriver on it. So a knife is one of the things that helps us but it's not the
*28:11.900- 28:16.660* :  only thing we use. But now the company says because more and more countries are banning or
*28:16.660- 28:21.980* :  restricting knives for safety reasons, it's going to be making bladeless models. At the moment,
*28:21.980- 28:27.340* :  UK legislation hasn't banned carrying Swiss Army knives but there are concerns around rising
*28:27.340- 28:33.120* :  knife crime. There are now roughly 400 Swiss Army knife models including one with 73 functions,
*28:33.120- 28:39.540* :  featuring tweezers and even a USB stick but it has always had a blade which is why this announcement
*28:39.540- 28:44.980* :  is a big deal. Victoria Knox is keen to stress that the original Swiss Army knife isn't being
*28:44.980- 28:50.440* :  replaced by this new model but without a blade can they still call it a Swiss Army knife.
*28:51.680- 28:57.360* :  Paul Hawkins, the first of the Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals has been taking place in Sweden
*28:57.360- 29:01.920* :  where 15 countries have been competing for a place in the grand final on Saturday.
*29:02.620- 29:06.400* :  Our Arts Correspondent David Lito reports from the host city Malmo.
*29:07.100- 29:14.040* :  Hello, my name is Windows 95. This is Windows 95 now, appearing from the large
*29:14.040- 29:20.160* :  egg. He's representing the Netherlands and Europe.
*29:22.300- 29:28.320* :  Hear the favourites, Croatia. Eurovision has arrived in Malmo. Security is a bit more visible
*29:28.320- 29:33.160* :  than normal because of his suit surrounding Gaza and Israel's participation in the contest.
*29:33.160- 29:39.140* :  All attention is under first say-file and for one country with a long and illustrious Eurovision
*29:39.140- 29:46.480* :  history, something a bit different. The country that brought us double the Eurovision winner
*29:46.480- 29:52.060* :  Johnny Logan has in recent years for a further fallow period. The solution Ireland hopes is
*29:52.580- 29:58.580* :  that it's a choice in case of new eyebrows. I don't know what happened for Ireland to suddenly
*29:59.160- 30:07.120* :  put their faith in a non-binary, alt-witch boss. I think it was a while coming.
*30:07.760- 30:13.180* :  And the reaction in Ireland, would it be fair to say mixed? Yeah, definitely, definitely a mixed
*30:13.180- 30:18.540* :  reaction. Some priests not liking me very much. I don't think you're too bothered by that height.
*30:23.120- 30:27.740* :  Maybe a song contest for fans known, staging and spectacle are crucial.
*30:28.520- 30:31.700* :  An idea that Ireland is definitely a brassy.
*30:34.460- 30:36.140* :  That report by David Slyther.
*30:39.400- 30:43.460* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
