*01:23.820- 01:29.640* :  I'm Nigel Adely, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 1st of May, these are our main stories.
*01:30.420- 01:36.480* :  Former US President Donald Trump is fined for contempt of court during his hush money trial in
*01:36.480- 01:41.960* :  New York. An international arrest warrant has been issued for the former president of the Central
*01:41.960- 01:49.460* :  African Republic for Antswah Bowsese over alleged crimes against humanity. Columbia's president says
*01:49.460- 01:55.200* :  a massive amount of bullets, grenades and missiles have been stolen from the military
*01:55.200- 02:11.560* :  and sold to criminals. Also in his podcast, the Manchester City Footballer Erling Harland
*02:11.560- 02:21.480* :  swaps goals for the world of gaming. The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York
*02:21.480- 02:28.520* :  has warned him he'll face timing jail if he keeps violating a gagging order. The former US President
*02:28.520- 02:36.180* :  was fined $9,000 for contempt of court. That was for nine violations of the order banning him from
*02:36.180- 02:43.160* :  making public statements about witnesses and jurors. Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate
*02:43.160- 02:50.740* :  has pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records to conceal a payment of $130,000
*02:50.940- 02:57.780* :  to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. I spoke to our correspondent, Netta Talfik, who was
*02:57.780- 03:02.760* :  outside the court house in New York. Anastra, if the judge appears to be running out of patience
*03:02.760- 03:09.080* :  with Donald Trump. That's absolutely right. I mean, the judge had, during a hearing, a head of
*03:09.080- 03:13.920* :  this decision told Trump's legal team that they were losing all credibility with the court for
*03:13.920- 03:20.180* :  suggesting that his posts were merely responding to other political attacks. And in his ruling,
*03:20.180- 03:27.220* :  the judge said there was only, you know, one post that had a tenuous correlation as he put it
*03:27.640- 03:33.460* :  to words by Michael Cohen, the key witness in this case. Otherwise, he said that Donald Trump had
*03:33.460- 03:39.340* :  willfully violated the gagging order over and over again. And he said that under the law, he's
*03:39.340- 03:46.060* :  only allowed to find him $1,000 per violation. But that given Trump is wealthy, it may not even be
*03:46.060- 03:51.860* :  enough to, you know, convince him that he needs to stop violating the gagging order. So he did say
*03:51.860- 03:56.780* :  that jail time might be a necessary punishment if Trump continues on this course.
*03:57.060- 03:59.960* :  But there's a very delicate balancing act here for the judges, isn't there?
*04:00.180- 04:05.700* :  There is. Keep in mind that, you know, finding defendants, their lawyers and contempt of court
*04:06.220- 04:12.140* :  isn't something that happens quite regularly. You have to tie in the fact that this is a candidate
*04:12.140- 04:18.100* :  for presidential office. The judge, even in his ruling, said that this is someone who he has to
*04:18.100- 04:26.080* :  balance his right to free speech with the order of this court. And so the judge, you know, said
*04:26.080- 04:31.880* :  this is something he had to do to protect the integrity of the system. But he understands that
*04:31.880- 04:36.200* :  Trump does still have free speech. And that's why we're seeing Donald Trump being able to still
*04:36.200- 04:41.540* :  attack this judge despite the gag order. And of course, the trial continues who have we heard from.
*04:41.680- 04:47.040* :  That's right. We've had a real kind of interesting mix of witnesses that are there to kind of give
*04:47.040- 04:52.100* :  evidence in a narrative fashion and other witnesses who have been called on the stands simply.
*04:52.100- 04:58.040* :  So prosecutors could enter new evidence in, you know, for example, you had a director of the
*04:58.040- 05:04.700* :  archives of CESPAN, which is a public broadcasting service here in the United States on the stand so
*05:04.700- 05:09.480* :  they could show videos of Donald Trump saying he didn't know any of these women who had come forward.
*05:09.480- 05:15.280* :  And that Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, was a great friend. So videos to try to hit at his
*05:15.280- 05:21.200* :  credibility as a witness. But then the last witness we had is Keith Davidson. He has stormy
*05:21.200- 05:26.840* :  Daniels, the adult film star who's at the center of this case. It was her lawyer who is on the stand.
*05:26.840- 05:32.120* :  And he's just been detailing the text messages and conversations that went on with the tabloid,
*05:32.120- 05:38.840* :  the national inquirer, about the negotiations to buy first the Karen McDougal story, that former
*05:38.840- 05:44.120* :  playboy model. And I'm sure we'll then get to some of the text messages that led to the stormy
*05:44.120- 05:50.640* :  Daniels, so-called hush money payment. Letta Talfiq in New York. America's top diplomat,
*05:50.640- 05:56.520* :  Anthony Blinken has arrived in Israel after flying in from Jordan. He'll be pushing to secure
*05:56.520- 06:01.660* :  a cease-fire in Gaza during meetings with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*06:01.660- 06:08.420* :  another top Israeli figures. Speaking early in a man, he said Israel had made big concessions.
*06:08.640- 06:15.260* :  Our focus right now is on getting a cease-fire and hostage at home. That is the most urgent thing.
*06:15.620- 06:22.380* :  And it's also, I think, what is achievable because the Israelis have put a strong proposal
*06:22.380- 06:27.700* :  on the table. They've demonstrated that they're willing to compromise. And now it's on Hamas.
*06:28.100- 06:33.700* :  On Tuesday, Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his insistence that whatever happens, the city of
*06:33.700- 06:41.060* :  Raffa in southern Gaza remains a target. We'll enter Raffa because we have no other choice.
*06:41.060- 06:46.660* :  We'll destroy the Hamas battalions there. We'll complete all the objectives of the war,
*06:46.660- 06:50.540* :  including the repatriation of all our abducted people.
*06:50.900- 06:56.820* :  The head of the UN Antonio Guterres, warned that an assault on Raffa would be an unbearable
*06:56.820- 07:02.040* :  escalation. Hamas is yet to decide on whether to accept the terms of the latest cease-fire
*07:02.040- 07:08.120* :  proposals, hammered out during mediated talks in Cairo. The US said there should be no more delays
*07:08.120- 07:12.800* :  or excuses. Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Frank Gardner reports.
*07:13.380- 07:18.000* :  Well, Hamas ponders the proposed true steel that could see dozens of Israeli hostages released.
*07:18.680- 07:24.180* :  Hardliners in Mr. Netanyahu's coalition have publicly threatened to walk out if that deal goes
*07:24.180- 07:29.220* :  ahead. So today, he reverted to ground that both he and they feel comfortable on,
*07:29.920- 07:34.300* :  vying to press ahead with a military assault on the southern Gaza City of Raffa,
*07:34.800- 07:40.580* :  something the US and Britain strongly oppose. Israel's ground-offensive in Gaza has all but
*07:40.580- 07:45.920* :  petered out, but its military believes the last remaining battalions of Hamas are in Raffa,
*07:46.360- 07:52.060* :  as well as quite possibly its fugitive leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October
*07:52.060- 07:58.780* :  7th massacre. The US does not believe Israel could conduct such an operation in Raffa without
*07:58.780- 08:05.680* :  unacceptably high civilian casualties. Now Mr. Netanyahu has a new problem. He is worried,
*08:05.680- 08:11.200* :  some say, terrified that the international criminal court in the Hague is poised to issue a
*08:11.200- 08:16.660* :  rest warrants, for him and other senior Israeli leaders relating to Israel's treatment of the
*08:16.660- 08:23.060* :  Palestinians. This possibility, he said today, is a scandal on a historic scale. He called it
*08:23.060- 08:29.920* :  an absurdity, a distortion of justice and history, and an unprecedented anti-Semitic hate crime.
*08:30.840- 08:36.640* :  Frank Gardner. An international arrest warrant has been issued for the exiled former president of
*08:36.640- 08:42.080* :  the Central African Republic, Francois Bozzese, in connection with the alleged crimes against
*08:42.080- 08:47.640* :  humanity. Will Ross reports. The Central African and foreign judges at the court in the
*08:47.640- 08:53.100* :  Capitol Bongi say there's evidence that Francois Bozzese is criminally responsible for atrocities
*08:53.100- 08:58.520* :  committed by soldiers under his command. Members of the presidential guard and other security forces
*08:58.840- 09:03.920* :  are accused of murder, forced disappearances, torture and rape. The former president will only
*09:03.920- 09:08.620* :  face trial if the authorities in Guinea-Besau, ways in exile, agree to hand him over.
*09:09.120- 09:14.300* :  In late 2020, Mr. Bozzese tried to seize power again, but the rebel group he still heads was
*09:14.300- 09:19.620* :  pushed back from the Capitol after Russia sent in hundreds of paramilitaries from the Wagner group.
*09:20.560- 09:26.620* :  Will Ross. In cases of cyber crime, we often think about people hacking into bank accounts
*09:26.620- 09:33.240* :  or secret government documents. But in Finland, a case has concluded regarding something
*09:33.240- 09:39.960* :  a good deal more personal. Julius Kivamaki has been jailed for six years after attempting to
*09:39.960- 09:47.620* :  blackmail over 30,000 people with confidential notes from their therapy sessions. Our cyber security
*09:47.620- 09:53.420* :  correspondent Joe Tidy gave me more details. We sometimes hear very rarely, but it does happen
*09:53.420- 09:59.140* :  of medical records being stolen by hackers. But this was about your therapy notes. This is about
*09:59.140- 10:05.160* :  your mental health, which is arguably even more sensitive. So there were around 33,000 people
*10:05.160- 10:10.320* :  in the database who had had their notes that had been taken by their therapists, accessed and
*10:10.320- 10:15.780* :  stolen and downloaded by Kivamaki, as well as other things, for example, your address, your email
*10:15.780- 10:21.980* :  account and no financial records, but obviously also where you live. And the blackmail at the time was
*10:21.980- 10:27.860* :  pay me or I'll publish online. And then in the end, he did. And this isn't the first time that
*10:27.860- 10:33.320* :  Kivamaki has been on the radar with the police in Finland. No, he's an infamous name. My first
*10:33.320- 10:40.460* :  came across him in 2014. So nearly 10 years ago when he and his cybercrime gang called Lizard Squad,
*10:40.460- 10:45.300* :  this is a teenage gang, so they come up with these silly names. They attacked Xbox Live and
*10:45.300- 10:49.680* :  PlayStation Network at Christmas and brought these services down for potentially hundreds of
*10:49.680- 10:54.220* :  millions of people on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. So this was an individual who's been in the
*10:54.440- 10:59.920* :  scene for a long time, reveled in the chaos that you can cause through cybercrime. And then was
*10:59.920- 11:06.440* :  convicted in 2015 of some of those crimes as a teenager, given a suspended sentence. So not
*11:06.660- 11:10.680* :  really much of a deterrent. And at the time that the fear was, this isn't enough to put off
*11:10.680- 11:16.280* :  someone like Kivamaki and lo and behold, this big hack happens in 2020, which he's now been
*11:16.280- 11:21.940* :  convicted of. And how has he viewed in Finland? Oh, he's absolutely hated. You can imagine, this is
*11:21.940- 11:27.560* :  an individual who, in the words of the prosecution, ruthlessly targeted vulnerable people. And not
*11:27.560- 11:32.460* :  only that, Finland is a small country. So I went over to Finland to witness some of the court case
*11:32.460- 11:38.740* :  myself. And the feeling there is that everyone in Finland knows someone or is an individual
*11:38.740- 11:43.780* :  themselves who have been a target and been a victim of the Fistamo hack. And this hack, it's hard
*11:43.780- 11:48.240* :  to overestimate how much it has been impacted on the country. It's the largest criminal investigation
*11:48.240- 11:54.060* :  and criminal trial in history by numbers of victims. And even the company itself as Stama,
*11:54.060- 12:00.020* :  which is obviously now collapsed into bankruptcy. It's CEO has been convicted himself. That all came
*12:00.020- 12:05.880* :  crashing down. This fast-growing, well-respected company that was really filling a gap in society
*12:05.880- 12:13.040* :  of providing mental health care to people that need it. Joe Tidey, the European Parliamentary
*12:13.040- 12:19.440* :  elections take place in early June. In France, the story of the moment is the runaway lead of the
*12:19.440- 12:25.560* :  far right. The national rally of Marine Le Pen and a young co-leader, Jordan Bardella,
*12:26.000- 12:32.500* :  stand at 32 percent in the polls. That's around double its nearest rival, the party of President
*12:32.500- 12:38.740* :  Macron. Our Paris correspondent, Yusko Field, has been finding out what's driving up the party's
*12:38.740- 12:45.540* :  support. And he starts by taking us to the cathedral town of Sons, 160 kilometers southeast
*12:51.880- 12:56.660* :  of Paris. The national rally is on a roll and it knows it. Never has the party seemed so full
*12:56.660- 13:02.280* :  of confidence. Here at the annual spring fair in Sons, Jordan Bardella, the unfeasibly young
*13:02.280- 13:10.000* :  party president. He's just 28. He's been welcomed like a hero. Sometimes you have to pinch yourself.
*13:10.000- 13:16.300* :  This is the far right, the ex-national front, the untouchables, and now here in the French provinces
*13:16.300- 13:24.460* :  totally more. We came for a photo of Jordan and we got it, so we are happy. It's so young,
*13:24.460- 13:31.160* :  but that's good. Macron was young too, so maybe Jordan can take over. So what's pushing the party
*13:31.160- 13:37.380* :  so high? Events are certainly helping. Inflation is biting. President Macron out here, anyway,
*13:37.380- 13:42.800* :  is very unpopular. And now there's been a run of atrocious stories of violence among immigrant
*13:42.800- 13:48.740* :  communities in schools. In the Paris suburbs, a 15-year-old Shamseddin was beaten to death,
*13:49.180- 13:54.500* :  seemingly by the brothers of a teenage girl angry that she was in contact with him. The case
*13:54.500- 14:02.000* :  is not unique. The strength of the French national rally, the national rally's newest star recruit
*14:02.000- 14:08.420* :  it translates into a crying popular demand for more authority. Fabrice Lagerie is a big cat for
*14:08.420- 14:14.160* :  the national rally. He's the former head of the EU's Frontier Agency Frontex and strongly of
*14:14.160- 14:19.900* :  the belief that uncontrolled immigration is a factor in much of the violence. This is a cultural
*14:19.900- 14:28.960* :  clash. The fact that some boys 15 while teenagers consider that their sister shall not talk to a boy
*14:29.920- 14:36.380* :  that this is a matter of honor and this is not part of our culture. In France, it's not part of our
*14:36.380- 14:44.480* :  culture. I'm sure nowhere in the in continental Europe or in the UK. The recruitment of senior figures
*14:44.480- 14:49.800* :  like Lagerie is another reason why the national rally is riding high. New social categories,
*14:49.800- 14:55.120* :  not just the white working class, are being attracted to the party as it gains respectability.
*14:56.040- 15:01.680* :  Christel Crapley of the opinion pollsters BVA. We see that a lot of people belonging to upper
*15:01.680- 15:08.540* :  classes, a lot of old people, but also young people could consider these votes. It's not seen
*15:08.540- 15:15.280* :  as a taboo as it used to be for the older people, younger ones or upper classes. That is
*15:15.280- 15:23.580* :  something which is very different than before. Back on the campaign trail in Seoul, I asked
*15:23.580- 15:28.760* :  Jordan Bardela what was his party's response to what he calls the savagery of society.
*15:38.360- 15:39.380* :  The French agree.
*15:41.320- 15:47.800* :  Husco field reporting. Some of Europe's most common tree species will probably not survive this
*15:47.800- 15:53.600* :  century because of climate change. That's the conclusion of researchers at the University of Vienna,
*15:54.180- 15:59.420* :  who say that between a third and half a tree species will not be able to cope with future
*15:59.420- 16:05.340* :  conditions. And they say that should inform which trees are planted now, the Reforestation.
*16:05.980- 16:11.900* :  Peter Wollabenn is the author of the Hidden Life of Trees. Sarah Montague asked him what he
*16:11.900- 16:18.640* :  thought about the research. This is the typical mistake some scientists make regarding a forest
*16:18.760- 16:25.620* :  as an assembly of trees. We know from other studies that forced native forests are reacting
*16:25.620- 16:31.920* :  perfectly in times of climate change. For example, that some bacteria can switch off and on
*16:31.920- 16:41.000* :  genes in trees and trees therefore get more drought resistant. So I'm not going 100% with this
*16:41.000- 16:49.600* :  new study. Right. So you think forests, trees are much more resilient because there's a very wide
*16:49.600- 16:57.600* :  range of weather and climate expected over the next few decades from very wet to increasingly hot.
*16:57.880- 17:03.820* :  Exactly. For example, the Gulf Stream is getting weekend weekend especially for where Britain,
*17:03.820- 17:11.480* :  the scientists say that the climate became in winter times much colder. So which climate are we
*17:11.480- 17:17.120* :  expecting? We don't know. We know that it is becoming an average warmer but locally that can
*17:17.120- 17:24.960* :  mean something very different. So I don't like those forecasts saying that trees may not withstand
*17:24.960- 17:30.900* :  the climate in 10, 20, 40, 50 years because we don't know the local climate. Do you think that
*17:30.900- 17:37.360* :  they can adapt at the speed that we expect the climate to change? We first thought that an
*17:37.360- 17:44.120* :  adaption can occur between generations and that means that it takes hundreds of years that trees
*17:44.240- 17:50.840* :  adapt. Now we know trees are learning not exactly but nearly in the same speed we do. So from one
*17:50.840- 17:56.700* :  year to another we see that trees are adapting and the best thing is that they give this knowledge
*17:56.700- 18:03.540* :  to their seedlings in the same time so that the next generation of trees which is still growing
*18:03.540- 18:10.700* :  under the mother trees are much better adapted than the old trees. So they are not that slow that
*18:10.700- 18:18.220* :  we thought. Okay, to listen to you I mean you make some sound almost human. The thing is I know that
*18:18.220- 18:25.540* :  there are some critics that it's too that I'm entomorphizing trees but to be honest how should we
*18:25.540- 18:32.840* :  understand other beings without transferring it in our world of understanding. So nature didn't
*18:32.840- 18:39.340* :  invent a special way just for us and another way for all other beings so that we are under the same
*18:39.340- 18:45.700* :  rules. They are the same principles and it's no wonder that many many species around us are
*18:45.700- 18:50.680* :  reacting in the same way they are learning they are adapting within a certain range. So we
*18:50.680- 18:56.440* :  shouldn't lay back and say okay they will do the job and we can go on with our greenhouse gases.
*18:56.440- 19:03.700* :  Now we should stop it now and they're a good rules on the way new laws and I'm an optimist I think
*19:03.700- 19:08.060* :  we will make it. Peter Waller band author of the Hidden Life of Trees.

*20:38.500- 20:44.200* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Coast Guard vessels from China and the Philippines have
*20:44.200- 20:50.840* :  clashed in one of the most hotly contested waterways in the world. The Chinese find water cannon
*20:50.840- 20:56.740* :  as the Filipino boats trying to deliver food and fuel to fishing vessels around Scarborough
*20:56.740- 21:04.840* :  shawl in the South China Sea. The area was seized by China in 2012. The BBC South Asia correspondent
*21:04.840- 21:09.340* :  Jonathan Head was on board one of the Filipino boats and sent this report.
*21:14.940- 21:19.000* :  This is how China defends its claim to the entire South China Sea.
*21:20.120- 21:24.740* :  Water cannon raking the deck of a Filipino coast guard ship soaking everyone.
*21:28.760- 21:33.140* :  We were just to off Scarborough shawl a coral reef that's claimed by both countries
*21:36.920- 21:44.420* :  but much closer to the Philippines. This Coast Guard ship has already
*21:45.300- 21:48.920* :  attacked this ship once. Water cannon and blast at the decks as you can see
*21:49.360- 21:53.900* :  it's spraying water in the air. That's a threat. It's very likely it's going to come back
*21:54.740- 21:55.440* :  and hit us again.
*22:05.680- 22:11.920* :  The Chinese attacks continued for half an hour. This is a familiar ordeal for these Filipino crew
*22:11.920- 22:17.980* :  members who must conduct these missions while greatly outnumbered by the flattilla of Chinese
*22:17.980- 22:25.580* :  ships outside. All morning we watched them shadowing us and they watched us back.
*22:26.780- 22:31.020* :  Before moving in for a risky game of maritime cat and mouse.
*22:34.420- 22:37.580* :  Well this Chinese Coast Guard ship has come so close now there's only perhaps
*22:38.160- 22:43.740* :  40 or 50 meters between us. This is a very aggressive tactic the Philippines crew are
*22:43.740- 22:47.800* :  preparing to throw boys over the side in case there's a collision between the two.
*22:51.880- 22:58.000* :  After years of relative inaction the Philippines is now pushing back against China's dominance in
*22:58.000- 23:03.720* :  these waters. Encouraged by the firm backing it's had from the United States.
*23:07.060- 23:13.500* :  The Chinese presence here is overwhelming though. In the end our ship was forced to return to
*23:13.500- 23:19.860* :  Manila and there's always the possibility that these increasingly combative encounters in this
*23:19.860- 23:27.220* :  strategically sensitive region escalate into something bigger. Jonathan head reporting from the
*23:27.220- 23:32.440* :  South China Sea and there's a video of that incident and background of attention in the South
*23:32.440- 23:40.040* :  China Sea on the BBC website. The issue of corruption in Colombia's military is on the agenda once
*23:40.040- 23:46.680* :  again. President Gustavo Petro says missiles thousands of grenades and over a million
*23:46.680- 23:51.500* :  bullets have all gone missing and says corrupt members of the armed forces at a blame.
*23:52.300- 23:55.960* :  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia gave me more details.
*23:55.960- 24:02.260* :  It all came from a statement by the president Gustavo Petro next to the head of the military
*24:02.260- 24:08.420* :  that he gave a very detailed list of what we're missing in the inventory of two of Colombia's main
*24:08.420- 24:15.320* :  military units and that has surprised everyone. What President Petro said is that the people behind
*24:15.320- 24:21.920* :  that need to be punished and he said it's down to corruption, corrupt military personnel who
*24:21.920- 24:28.500* :  have taken guns and ammunition and sold it to criminal groups and possibly to rebel groups as well.
*24:28.700- 24:33.780* :  And of course Colombia's military has been active over many years but it seems they may have been
*24:33.780- 24:38.500* :  inadvertently perhaps as far as the hierarchy are concerned they may have been arming their
*24:38.500- 24:44.460* :  enemies. Yes that's something that doesn't go down very well. Amazingly something that happens
*24:44.460- 24:49.900* :  across Latin America. You have the police selling guns to criminals who then fight them and kill
*24:49.900- 24:55.840* :  them. It's really bad. You had this week helicopter crash that killed nine Colombians soldiers who
*24:55.840- 25:01.180* :  went to fight the Gulf Cartel. They're now the main drug trafficking gang. You have other rebel
*25:01.180- 25:06.080* :  groups involved in fighting the government. Criminal analysis is really a problem in Colombia
*25:06.080- 25:11.900* :  and organized crime. And the problem here you have is that the Colombian military they're very
*25:11.900- 25:17.360* :  well armed. I mean compared to other countries in the region they have received an estimated 10
*25:17.360- 25:23.260* :  billion dollars from the United States to fight the drug cartels. So they have a lot of weapons
*25:23.260- 25:28.840* :  and for some people this is just a matter of short-term profit. And I can't imagine the Americans
*25:28.840- 25:33.460* :  will be too impressed either because the money they've given to Colombia to fight the drug
*25:33.460- 25:39.520* :  wars was a major plank of their foreign policy. Yes they still helped Colombia. They still involved
*25:39.520- 25:45.000* :  with the Colombian army. They won't be happy at all. And I think in Colombia people will be
*25:45.040- 25:51.220* :  furious because criminalism is on the rise after the peace process with the FARC which failed in
*25:51.220- 25:57.240* :  some ways. Many of the former rebels went into criminality, went into drug trafficking and that
*25:57.240- 26:02.440* :  is a problem. And you have a history of problems with the Colombian army, including corruption,
*26:02.440- 26:07.340* :  including human rights violations, of course not everyone. But President Petro says he's determined
*26:07.340- 26:13.340* :  to fight that. And he said more might be found when they do an inventory of other military units
*26:13.340- 26:19.800* :  across the country. Leonardo Roscio. One of the biggest names in crypto finance has been sentenced
*26:19.800- 26:26.060* :  to four months imprisonment after pleading guilty to money laundering last November. Changpeng Zhao
*26:26.060- 26:32.120* :  is the billionaire former chief executive of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.
*26:32.860- 26:37.100* :  Tim Franks had more from Joshua Oliver, a journalist with the financial times.
*26:38.120- 26:43.960* :  CZ as he's universally called in crypto by his initials was effectively charged with failing to
*26:43.960- 26:49.420* :  prevent money laundering in Binance, which is an enormous cryptocurrency enterprise. And it's
*26:49.440- 26:53.940* :  important to emphasize just how much money is flowing through this company on a daily basis,
*26:53.940- 26:58.020* :  billions and billions of dollars. The US government said they had an obligation to be
*26:58.020- 27:03.760* :  checking and making sure money wasn't flowing to drugs, to human trafficking, to terrorists,
*27:03.760- 27:09.020* :  to criminal organizations. And Binance has now effectively pled guilty to saying that they didn't
*27:09.020- 27:13.760* :  have the proper checks in place to stop money laundering. And it's for that that he's now
*27:13.760- 27:17.920* :  been sentenced to four months imprisonment. Lots of people are drawing parallels, of course, with
*27:17.920- 27:24.240* :  Sandbankman Fried who got 25 years for his role in crypto financial fraud. I mean, that was
*27:24.240- 27:30.240* :  obviously a different case. And it was he didn't plead guilty, but it's a massive contrast,
*27:30.240- 27:34.300* :  isn't it, in terms of the length of time they're going to serve? It's really striking. I mean,
*27:34.300- 27:39.420* :  obviously, by the lights of the US legal system, both are sort of technically fair decisions,
*27:39.500- 27:44.600* :  but I think it's very, very odd that you see, the Sandbankman Fried and FTX case was one that was
*27:44.600- 27:50.140* :  quite sort of intuitive for people. The money was stolen from everyday individuals. And so,
*27:50.300- 27:54.380* :  you know, that carries a heavy sentence. But I think that the Binance case was really, really
*27:54.860- 28:00.100* :  serious and probably deserves more attention than it has gotten so far. Because, you know, we are
*28:00.100- 28:04.580* :  talking about money as the Justice Department of Legends going to terrorist groups like Hamas,
*28:04.580- 28:10.640* :  money going to criminal organizations, to the dark net. And it is really important that there are
*28:10.640- 28:14.600* :  proper checks in place to stop this kind of thing from happening. And it's also ultimately a
*28:14.600- 28:19.400* :  case about the, you know, the ability of governments and of countries to impose some certain level
*28:19.400- 28:24.300* :  of control on this cryptocurrency industry. The financial journalist Joshua Oliver.
*28:25.240- 28:31.700* :  Next to the world of gaming, where Manchester City striker Erling Harland is the first footballer
*28:31.920- 28:37.180* :  to become a character in one of the world's most popular mobile games, Clash of the Clans,
*28:37.760- 28:43.600* :  known for his prolific goal-scoring, the Norwegian will now take up a new role, ruling fantasy
*28:43.600- 28:49.680* :  villages as the barbarian king. But how did it all happen? Here's Alfie Harbysham.
*28:50.080- 28:54.780* :  The trailer shows Erling Harland sat at home smiling to himself on the sofa,
*28:55.400- 29:00.660* :  before all of a sudden a group of animated elves and skeletons appear in his living room.
*29:10.100- 29:15.140* :  Using fireballs and swords, they whisk him into a portal, where he becomes an animated
*29:15.140- 29:22.020* :  character in Clash of the Clans. And he certainly looks the part. The almost 200cm tall Norwegian
*29:22.020- 29:27.480* :  with his flowing blonde hair is often likened to a modern Viking. And on the football pitch,
*29:27.480- 29:32.880* :  he's known as the Terminator, shrugging off defenders in his way as he burst towards the goal.
*29:33.540- 29:39.440* :  So, probably quite a good fit for his new role of slinging explosives at dragons in the enemy villages.
*29:43.900- 29:48.480* :  But he's not the only footballer who's taken the gaming plunge. Argentinian Lionel Messi and
*29:48.480- 29:53.880* :  Brazil's Neymar Junior have already both made their debut on the battlefield as characters in
*29:53.880- 30:05.420* :  Call of Duty. But anyone wanting the thrill of playing as one of them would have to part with
*30:05.420- 30:10.580* :  $20, and it's still not known how much of that made it into their own pockets.
*30:11.420- 30:15.960* :  But it's not all about the money, because today's footballers are often fans of gaming themselves,
*30:15.980- 30:22.560* :  an industry that made $400 billion in revenue last year, more than film and music combined.
*30:23.540- 30:28.360* :  And in the case of Erling Harland, he was the one who reached out to Clash of the Clans
*30:28.360- 30:33.660* :  to ask to become the barbarian king. He says it's a game he's been playing since he was 10,
*30:34.120- 30:36.640* :  describing it as a really cool moment.
*30:44.500- 30:50.540* :  Alfie Harbyshire reporting. When three-year-old sailor class began complaining of monsters
*30:50.540- 30:56.160* :  in her bedroom, her parents thought it was just a figment of a child's overactive imagination.
*30:57.000- 31:02.820* :  But then a beekeeper discovered tens of thousands of honeybees in the walls above her bedroom
*31:02.820- 31:09.360* :  in the family home in Charlotte in the US state of North Carolina. James Reynolds spoke to
*31:09.360- 31:15.340* :  sailors mother Ashley Massis and began by asking her what did she think about her daughter's comments
*31:15.340- 31:20.220* :  initially. When she first said that there were monsters, we had just actually watched
*31:20.220- 31:26.020* :  Monsters Inc. At the time, I was three months pregnant and thought maybe this is a regression
*31:26.080- 31:31.080* :  of some sort or she's pointing towards the closet and we're watching a movie. So it would make
*31:31.080- 31:37.600* :  sense. At night, we had a bedtime routine of going in and pretending to look for all the monsters
*31:37.600- 31:44.600* :  and we gave her a spray bottle of water for monster spray. So it went on for months and we thought
*31:44.600- 31:49.420* :  this was just a normal overactive three-year-old's imagination. When you went into her room,
*31:50.240- 31:55.740* :  did you see any evidence of the bees that you eventually found? I know you had a monster spray,
*31:55.740- 32:01.480* :  but you weren't looking for bees. No, no, not at all. And you know, what's funny is when all of this
*32:01.480- 32:06.000* :  happened through the past couple of months, I slept on the floor in that room with her. I didn't
*32:06.320- 32:12.280* :  hear anything, but we learned later from the beekeeper that when she started to get very adamant
*32:12.280- 32:17.720* :  about it, it wasn't until springtime when a couple weeks ago when we started to see some bees
*32:17.720- 32:22.940* :  come in and out of our attic vent that we said, oh, we should just get a pest control spray.
*32:23.060- 32:28.220* :  And at what point? I mean, here's the big reveal of the story. Did you work out? Hold on, the monster
*32:28.220- 32:32.880* :  she's thinking about other bees. She started to get really heightened and wanting to sleep in our room
*32:33.460- 32:38.380* :  and we thought maybe she's hearing bees and they add it. So we had the beekeeper come back and he
*32:38.380- 32:44.100* :  actually watched. He cut a hole into our attic wall. We have a hundred-year-old house and so we've
*32:44.100- 32:48.360* :  been slowly renovating each room. And this was one of, of course, the renovated rooms that need to
*32:48.360- 32:52.420* :  be cut up. And he cut into the hole in the wall and he saw the bees go down into the floor boards
*32:52.420- 32:57.940* :  and said, what is underneath? And we said, it's our daughter's room. Oh, was that the big light bulb
*32:57.940- 33:02.760* :  moment? Not yet. Okay. You know, we thought, okay, maybe it's still the ceiling, but then he had a
*33:02.760- 33:09.840* :  thermal camera and it lit up like a Christmas tree. It was insane. At first, what we saw, and you
*33:09.840- 33:15.160* :  could see in the video that I had put on social media, it looked almost like a man. It's like, what
*33:15.160- 33:19.440* :  are we looking at here? And he said, this is one of the biggest hives I've ever seen. It's Florida
*33:19.440- 33:26.220* :  ceiling. Wow. Okay, that's huge. Huge. And then it clicked. Oh my goodness. She was not pointing
*33:26.220- 33:31.060* :  at her closet. She's pointing at the wall next to her closet. Oh my goodness. Did you have to sit
*33:31.060- 33:35.640* :  down with her and say, you know, the monsters that you thought the monsters were, that you were
*33:35.640- 33:41.480* :  right about it kind of. They're actually bees. What we did is he actually was able to extract over
*33:41.480- 33:47.640* :  20,000 bees in the specialized bee box the first day. And he had it outside sitting on our porch.
*33:47.640- 33:52.560* :  And so she came back from school and my husband and I had come up with a game plan that we're
*33:52.560- 33:56.520* :  going to talk to her and tell her, you know what, these were the monsters. They're honeybees, but
*33:56.520- 34:02.360* :  that is what the monsters were. And what was very wonderful of our beekeeper as he came out
*34:02.360- 34:07.160* :  and he had the hat on and everything and he introduced himself as the beekeeper. And she said, no,
*34:07.160- 34:14.080* :  you are a monster hunter. Oh. And that was it. Actually, masses from Charlottes in North Carolina.
*34:14.140- 34:21.160* :  And her daughter was right all along. And that's all for months for now, but there will be a new
