*01:49.080- 01:52.200* :  president had taken drugs during his election campaign.
*01:54.860- 01:59.960* :  Also in the podcast, one of those of knock on benefits from that downturn was that we
*01:59.960- 02:04.900* :  had stocks that was maturing to a much higher age than it may have been allowed to, if
*02:04.900- 02:06.740* :  we'd been producing at the same levels.
*02:06.740- 02:10.880* :  The revival of Scotland's so-called ghost whiskey distilleries.
*02:15.420- 02:20.640* :  Floods and mudslides have continued to cause devastation in Brazil's southernmost state
*02:20.640- 02:26.060* :  of Rio Grande do Sul, at least 57 people are now reported to have died and dozens more
*02:26.060- 02:26.580* :  are missing.
*02:27.240- 02:32.280* :  Rescue teams in boats and plains are searching the ruins of collapsed homes, bridges and roads.
*02:32.280- 02:36.620* :  Thousands of residents have been forced to flee since the storms began last Saturday,
*02:37.160- 02:38.680* :  so Zeta Pereira is one of them.
*02:41.600- 02:42.520* :  I lost everything.
*02:43.180- 02:46.960* :  I lifted some furniture that I could, but I believe I lost everything.
*02:47.720- 02:48.840* :  I really am desperate.
*02:49.500- 02:51.000* :  It's the first time this has happened.
*02:51.780- 02:54.860* :  Meteorologists have predicted further rains to come.
*02:54.860- 02:56.420* :  David Bamford has more details.
*02:57.200- 03:02.240* :  The extreme weather affecting the state of Rio Grande do Sul has been caused by a rare
*03:02.240- 03:07.100* :  combination of hotter than average temperatures, high humidity and strong winds.
*03:07.540- 03:13.660* :  In Porto Alegre, the regional capital, the Gueba River broke its banks, submerging entire
*03:13.660- 03:14.340* :  neighborhoods.

*03:17.640- 03:23.100* :  A hydroelectric dam near the city of Bento González has collapsed, and a second dam is also
*03:23.100- 03:24.380* :  in danger of failing.
*03:24.960- 03:29.920* :  More than half of the nearly 500 towns and cities in the state have been affected by the
*03:29.920- 03:35.340* :  storms, with roads and bridges destroyed in several areas, at least half a million people
*03:35.340- 03:39.300* :  without power and clean water, with further rainfall expected.
*03:39.780- 03:44.800* :  Brazil's National Institute of Meteorology attributed the increased precipitation to
*03:44.800- 03:46.600* :  the climate phenomenon El Nino.
*03:47.140- 03:52.020* :  And Lula de Silva has visited the region, promising help from the central government.
*03:52.520- 03:53.380* :  David Bamford.
*03:53.820- 03:58.360* :  The unprecedented rains are also believed to be contributing to an all-time high number
*03:58.360- 04:00.100* :  of cases of dengue fever.
*04:00.460- 04:04.700* :  More than four million people have been infected with the mosquito-borne disease so far this
*04:04.740- 04:05.040* :  year.
*04:05.720- 04:10.320* :  Scientists say the steady increase in cases over the past two decades is linked to climate
*04:10.800- 04:10.820* :  change.
*04:11.380- 04:14.920* :  More than 2,000 people have died in 2024.
*04:15.480- 04:20.220* :  Mauricio Nicarra, professor of infectious diseases in São Paulo, told us why Brazil
*04:20.220- 04:21.580* :  had been hit so badly.
*04:22.100- 04:25.280* :  We have what was a perfect storm for dengue virus.
*04:26.020- 04:28.660* :  New dengue virus being introduced in the country.
*04:28.660- 04:32.420* :  The dengue tree variant shows up again after 10 years.
*04:33.000- 04:39.000* :  Dengue transmission goes down at the moment that we have our first cold front of the winter.
*04:39.200- 04:41.060* :  This cold front has not happened yet.
*04:41.140- 04:43.000* :  We are seeing exactly the opposite.
*04:43.000- 04:46.400* :  We are having a lot of heat for this time of the year.
*04:46.540- 04:51.860* :  And the outbreak, instead of being over by now, is still going on in some places.
*04:51.860- 04:54.120* :  They are still increasing the number of cases.
*04:54.420- 04:57.280* :  In São Paulo is the most populated city in the country.
*04:57.280- 04:59.700* :  This is putting our numbers of good time.
*05:00.100- 05:01.400* :  We have water everywhere.
*05:01.740- 05:06.680* :  And if we have heat and we have water, it's almost impossible to control the Egypt
*05:06.680- 05:07.520* :  time, mosquitoes.
*05:07.980- 05:13.100* :  And this mosquito is just getting more frequent in the whole world because of the globally.
*05:13.980- 05:15.520* :  Dengue is a severe disease.
*05:15.520- 05:21.620* :  We have fever, headache, cramps, muscular pain, and also can be fatal.
*05:21.840- 05:23.720* :  It's about 0.1 percent.
*05:23.720- 05:28.600* :  But when you're talking about millions and millions of cases like we are seeing in Brazil,
*05:29.040- 05:30.600* :  this becomes quite important.
*05:31.360- 05:34.040* :  There is a couple of vaccines in the market.
*05:34.580- 05:40.460* :  Double-Ageo, recommend the use, but they are not a valuable large scale because they
*05:40.460- 05:43.920* :  were just licensed and you will not affect this outbreak.
*05:44.300- 05:46.920* :  Maybe these vaccines will have an impact in the future.
*05:47.100- 05:52.200* :  But Dengue is also becoming more frequent in the United States and even in Europe.
*05:52.260- 05:54.740* :  Friends have a lot of cases last year.
*05:55.260- 05:58.920* :  So Dengue is becoming a major global health problem.
*05:59.400- 06:02.440* :  Poroshenokera, Professor of Infectious Diseases.
*06:02.880- 06:08.860* :  East Africa has also been hit by heavy rains in recent weeks, leaving some 400 people dead.
*06:09.540- 06:14.920* :  On Saturday, Kenya and Tanzania issued severe flooding alerts as coastal areas were buffeted
*06:14.920- 06:16.460* :  by tropical cyclone Hideo.
*06:17.140- 06:19.080* :  Thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
*06:19.080- 06:23.320* :  From the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, the BBC's Amsoi sent us this report.
*06:24.140- 06:28.460* :  A moment of rescue.
*06:29.160- 06:30.580* :  There is a sense of nervousness.
*06:33.480- 06:38.420* :  The man being rescued has sheltered on a tree for five days, stranded by flood waters
*06:38.420- 06:42.100* :  in Garissa, in the usually arid region of North and Kenya.
*06:43.800- 06:47.840* :  Red Cross workers have brought a boat to try and extract the man to safety.
*06:49.260- 06:50.780* :  The operation is successful.
*06:52.840- 06:58.120* :  In the south of the country, helicopters air-lit tourists from the Masai Mara Wildlife Reserve.
*06:58.120- 07:05.040* :  Risky teams and the stranded tourists wade through the waters to get to the aircraft.
*07:06.120- 07:10.620* :  Heavy rains over the past week have caused widespread floods in many parts of Kenya.
*07:11.360- 07:15.420* :  Roads, bridges and property have been destroyed, and many lives lost.
*07:18.960- 07:23.440* :  About an hour's drive west of the capital, Nairobi, a village is still trying to come
*07:23.440- 07:24.720* :  to terms with tragedy.
*07:26.580- 07:32.400* :  U.S. are searching through debris and mud for lost belongings and, perhaps, missing loved
*07:32.400- 07:32.780* :  ones.
*07:37.060- 07:39.400* :  Eunice Wenjiko is holding a tartar jacket.
*07:40.100- 07:42.660* :  It belongs to her missing relative's child, she says.
*07:43.020- 07:48.800* :  She recognizes other household items, a broken bed, a mattress, and what remained of
*07:48.800- 07:49.340* :  the roof.
*07:49.960- 07:53.500* :  Her relative Anne is among dozens who are unaccounted for.
*07:57.640- 08:01.280* :  That's why we suspect she's buried here, says Eunice, sounding helpless.
*08:04.020- 08:08.820* :  At three in the morning on Monday, a small lake that had formed uphill after a railway
*08:08.820- 08:14.140* :  tunnel was blocked, broke the barrier, and the water came gushing down the hill, sweeping
*08:14.140- 08:16.560* :  away or destroying everything on its path.
*08:17.500- 08:21.920* :  More than 50 people died, including Jim Skiromba's wife and child.
*08:25.560- 08:27.640* :  The water came, and I felt as if something was falling.
*08:28.800- 08:31.480* :  That's when the water swept us with my wife and child.
*08:32.220- 08:34.320* :  I got stuck and was drenched in mud.
*08:35.560- 08:37.240* :  I got up and started looking for my child.
*08:37.880- 08:40.540* :  The baby had cried for a while, but I could not find them.
*08:41.340- 08:42.420* :  There was nothing I could have done.
*08:43.700- 08:45.500* :  Such and rescue efforts are ongoing.
*08:45.960- 08:48.460* :  This is the single most deadly incident yet.
*08:48.960- 08:51.860* :  The government has been criticized for being slow to act.
*08:52.300- 08:55.140* :  President William Ruto addressed the nation on Friday.
*08:55.260- 09:02.800* :  The current unprecedented crisis of floods that our country is experiencing, as well as
*09:02.800- 09:10.540* :  the recent, devastating drought our country faced, is a direct consequence of our failure
*09:10.540- 09:17.400* :  to protect our environment, resulting in painful effects of climate change as we are
*09:17.400- 09:18.360* :  witnessing today.
*09:20.800- 09:23.760* :  The reopening of schools has now been delayed indefinitely.
*09:24.460- 09:29.260* :  People living near water reservoirs that are either full or already overflowing have
*09:29.260- 09:33.320* :  been ordered to evacuate, and the disaster response is set in motion.
*09:34.460- 09:35.760* :  But there's no respite yet.
*09:36.540- 09:41.740* :  More heavy rains are predicted across East Africa as a tropical cyclone pounds the Tanzanian
*09:41.740- 09:42.180* :  coast.
*09:42.340- 09:46.580* :  With the ground already saturated, there are fears about what lies ahead.
*09:47.760- 09:52.980* :  And so in Kenya, well, the cyclone reached parts of Tanzania on Saturday evening.
*09:52.980- 09:57.040* :  Our correspondent, Indira Salam, Alfred Lustek, gave us this update.
*09:57.840- 10:02.720* :  We are still experiencing strong winds and rains in some parts of the coast regions.
*10:03.360- 10:09.740* :  And this afternoon, there are a lot of destructive winds in an island called Mafia, which is around
*10:09.740- 10:16.400* :  70 miles south of that slum, and it has damaged properties and despite that the local government
*10:16.400- 10:21.220* :  has not yet told us about whether it has caused the therringeries to the people there.
*10:21.260- 10:26.820* :  But still, at the Derslam coastline, activities are just on and nothing has been reported
*10:26.820- 10:29.220* :  to be a downfall of that cyclone.
*10:29.400- 10:36.040* :  Though in the morning, a report by the meteorological agency said that the wind speed was around 120
*10:36.040- 10:42.360* :  kilometers per hour, and the cyclone was as far as 128 kilometers to reach Derslam.
*10:42.980- 10:44.860* :  Alfred Lustek, in Tanzania.
*10:45.800- 10:50.900* :  For the past week or so, there's been growing optimism about a possible deal between Hamas
*10:50.900- 10:56.480* :  and Israel, which could see a 40-day ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages
*10:56.480- 10:57.820* :  and Palestinian prisoners.
*10:58.480- 11:03.620* :  Negotiations intensified on Saturday, with a Hamas delegation meeting Egyptian, Katari
*11:03.620- 11:05.580* :  and US mediators in Cairo.
*11:06.180- 11:10.940* :  However, a senior official from the Palestinian group insisted that any agreement would have
*11:10.940- 11:13.140* :  to include a complete end to the war.
*11:13.620- 11:18.820* :  The Israeli government is opposed to that, and has so far refused to send envoys to Cairo.
*11:19.180- 11:25.660* :  But it's also facing calls from Israeli protesters in Tel Aviv to do all it can to bring the hostages home.
*11:28.260- 11:31.200* :  I'm here today to support a deal now.
*11:31.560- 11:33.160* :  Yesterday, we need to bring them back.
*11:33.540- 11:39.500* :  We need to bring all the hostages back, the alive ones, the dead ones, we got to bring them back.
*11:40.300- 11:41.700* :  We got to switch this government.
*11:45.520- 11:50.060* :  I had more about the latest negotiations from our correspondent Anna Foster in Jerusalem.
*11:50.800- 11:55.040* :  Hamas said that their delegation was going to Cairo in a spirit of positivity.
*11:55.680- 11:59.420* :  But interesting, they also talked about maturing the agreement.
*11:59.420- 12:03.760* :  That was a sort of translation of what they were saying, which meant that there are clearly still
*12:04.200- 12:05.900* :  sticking points between the two sides.
*12:05.900- 12:10.740* :  And the key seems to be the permanence of the ceasefire that is being discussed.
*12:11.460- 12:16.980* :  The fact that Hamas are very clear that they want any agreement to actually have baked into it,
*12:17.980- 12:22.020* :  you know, specified the idea that they will be working towards the end of this war.
*12:22.540- 12:28.280* :  Whereas from the Israeli perspective, they are still saying, in Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*12:28.280- 12:33.260* :  he was still saying very publicly that he wants to go ahead with a fresh ground offensive in Raffa,
*12:33.580- 12:36.180* :  regardless of any arrangement for a ceasefire.
*12:36.260- 12:40.620* :  So that shows you that there is still distance between the two sides.
*12:40.640- 12:44.320* :  And I think that is why you're seeing people like the head of the CIA, William Burns there,
*12:44.700- 12:49.820* :  to see if they can try and pull the two negotiating parties closer together and come up with an agreement.
*12:50.160- 12:54.020* :  Yeah, and on top of that, Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure at home,
*12:54.020- 12:58.200* :  won from the families of the hostages to get the remaining captives out,
*12:58.200- 13:03.220* :  but also from hardliners in his government who want to finish the operation to defeat Hamas.
*13:03.220- 13:05.340* :  Is there a wriggle room anywhere for him?
*13:07.200- 13:09.440* :  He finds himself in a very difficult position.
*13:09.440- 13:12.640* :  It's Saturday night here in Israel, and for months and months now,
*13:12.640- 13:16.360* :  they've been protest against his government even before the 7th of October.
*13:16.840- 13:21.420* :  Protests against the judicial reform that his coalition was trying to bring in.
*13:22.060- 13:23.660* :  And on the point of that coalition, of course,
*13:23.660- 13:26.980* :  it contains some of the most far-right elements of Israeli politics,
*13:26.980- 13:32.700* :  and they have made it very clear to Mr. Netanyahu that if he doesn't go ahead with his operation in Raffa,
*13:33.000- 13:36.080* :  then they will leave his coalition, and the government will fall.
*13:36.280- 13:38.100* :  And there'll be fresh elections here in Israel,
*13:38.440- 13:42.000* :  which, funnily enough, is what many of the protesters on the streets are calling for.
*13:42.440- 13:46.600* :  Those two things can't really be reconciled,
*13:46.600- 13:52.140* :  so it does raise questions about how Mr. Netanyahu and how Israel will proceed
*13:52.140- 13:56.300* :  to try and appease all of those different sides,
*13:56.300- 13:57.560* :  calling for different things.
*13:57.700- 14:00.540* :  And briefly, current conditions in Gaza, the WHO,
*14:00.540- 14:03.500* :  saying the threat of a famine hasn't gone away.
*14:05.340- 14:05.820* :  No, that's right.
*14:05.820- 14:09.100* :  They said that by May there was a good chance that famine would be declared,
*14:09.100- 14:12.620* :  particularly in the north of the strip, the situation there is dire.
*14:12.620- 14:16.100* :  There have been new aid routes that have opened just in the last week or so,
*14:16.100- 14:20.960* :  but it's fair to say that there still is nowhere near enough food in Gaza,
*14:20.960- 14:27.600* :  and that will continue to be the case until it comes in much larger quantities than it is now.
*14:28.220- 14:30.420* :  Anna Foster talking to me from Jerusalem.
*14:31.780- 14:34.920* :  Some restaurants in the US that have spent the past couple of years
*14:34.920- 14:39.500* :  trying to recover from the pandemic have had the task made harder by a rise in crime.
*14:40.200- 14:42.680* :  Faced with robberies, violence, and vandalism,
*14:42.680- 14:45.340* :  some are wondering whether they may be forced to close.
*14:46.020- 14:48.760* :  The BBC Sophie Williams spoke to some business owners,
*14:48.760- 14:53.340* :  including Kevin, owner of Guy Chicken and Rice in downtown San Francisco.
*14:53.960- 14:58.560* :  Last month his restaurant was attacked, causing around $10,000 worth of damage.
*15:01.360- 15:06.560* :  Within seven minutes took everything that they wanted from tablets, cash, goods.
*15:07.020- 15:10.320* :  A number of restaurants say that with fewer people working in offices
*15:10.320- 15:15.360* :  and coming to downtown areas after work, crime is adding to their woes.
*15:15.500- 15:18.300* :  We didn't expect the pandemic, we got through it,
*15:18.580- 15:22.240* :  and now we're dealing with the crime rate that has gone up.
*15:22.680- 15:25.360* :  Kevin is determined for his eatery to remain open,
*15:25.360- 15:29.100* :  but other people are making the hard decision to close their restaurants.
*15:29.700- 15:32.680* :  All right, in the East Bay, another restaurant closure due to safety concerns
*15:32.680- 15:38.140* :  we're talking about Denny's says it is closing their Oakland location after 54 years.
*15:38.800- 15:41.480* :  Sean Kennedy is with the US Restaurant Association.
*15:41.780- 15:47.360* :  It has certainly been getting more difficult in recent years with an increase in violent crime.
*15:47.920- 15:52.500* :  Restaurants have the lowest profit margin of any business on Main Street,
*15:52.500- 15:56.520* :  and so when you add to their already low margins that they have to do
*15:56.520- 16:01.960* :  increased cost on security and safety, it makes it that much tougher for a restaurant
*16:01.960- 16:03.900* :  to be able to keep its doors open every month.
*16:06.620- 16:10.460* :  Washington, D.C. is another area where eateries are feeling the strain.
*16:11.440- 16:14.680* :  Local news outlets here are frequently reporting closures.
*16:15.160- 16:17.940* :  Suati Post is co-owner of Flight Weinbar.
*16:18.860- 16:22.400* :  She says that the low footfall in the city has exacerbated the issue.
*16:22.540- 16:26.460* :  Even people coming back to office two days a week or three days a week just wasn't enough.
*16:26.460- 16:30.620* :  So we had a lot of boarded up buildings in our neighborhood,
*16:30.620- 16:33.920* :  and then you have a huge displaced population.
*16:33.920- 16:37.180* :  So the homeless population in Chinatown is pretty significant.
*16:37.620- 16:41.060* :  Sort of the feeling around the metro stations right around us,
*16:41.060- 16:42.660* :  I think people started feeling unsafe,
*16:43.160- 16:45.400* :  and so started avoiding those metro stations,
*16:45.400- 16:48.900* :  and I think that's where the crime aspect sort of does come in.
*16:48.900- 16:52.920* :  Our guests started telling us getting to you is getting hard,
*16:53.240- 16:57.240* :  walking through that metro station and coming to you just doesn't feel great.
*16:57.800- 17:01.000* :  Others have taken crime preventing measures into their own hands.
*17:01.660- 17:06.680* :  Fritz Brogan is head of the mission group that owns several restaurants here in Washington, D.C.
*17:06.960- 17:10.400* :  The number one issue we hear about right now when speaking with our staff and our customers
*17:10.400- 17:12.660* :  is crime, people are nervous about being out.
*17:13.300- 17:17.240* :  We've worked with our neighbours to hire off-duty police officers every day
*17:17.640- 17:20.400* :  to stay outside the restaurants and to make sure people feel safe,
*17:20.400- 17:24.240* :  to help walk staff to the metro or to ubers or to their cars,
*17:24.900- 17:27.480* :  and just sort of help give the perception that things are getting safer.
*17:29.140- 17:33.500* :  With chain restaurants also affected, there's been a big push to try and get this resolved.
*17:34.520- 17:37.960* :  The National Restaurant Association says it's been working with politicians
*17:37.960- 17:40.660* :  to try and counteract the effect of crime.
*17:41.380- 17:44.440* :  We are cautiously optimistic that we're in the right direction
*17:44.840- 17:47.540* :  and that we'll continue to be one of the safer areas that people can visit.
*17:48.120- 17:51.740* :  Now a Sean Kennedy ending that report by the BBC's Sophie Williams.
*17:52.760- 17:56.920* :  Spain's foreign ministry is attempting to calm tensions with Argentina.
*17:57.600- 18:01.960* :  After the Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente suggested the Argentine president,
*18:01.960- 18:04.120* :  Javier Miele, was a drug user.
*18:04.700- 18:07.860* :  At a panel discussion in northwestern Spain on Friday, Mr. Puente
*18:07.860- 18:13.220* :  suggested that Mr. Miele had ingested substances during last year's election campaign.
*18:13.220- 18:17.860* :  The Argentine leader has hit back as I heard from my Europe Regional Editor,
*18:18.180- 18:18.980* :  Danny Eberhardt.
*18:19.460- 18:24.780* :  Well, you can safely say that Javier Miele was not impressed at the suggestion he may have been on drugs.
*18:25.460- 18:28.020* :  He issued an official statement from his office,
*18:28.020- 18:33.620* :  accusing Oscar Puente of slander, but also laying heavily into Spain's prime minister, Pedro
*18:33.620- 18:36.080* :  Sanchez, who's the socialist.
*18:36.580- 18:42.980* :  He said that he made reference to corruption allegations that prompted an investigation into
*18:42.980- 18:47.720* :  Pedro Sanchez, his wife, which caused Mr. Sanchez himself to briefly consider resigning.
*18:47.720- 18:52.440* :  I hastened to add that the prosecutors in Spain have recommended that investigation be dropped
*18:52.440- 18:53.360* :  for lack of evidence.
*18:53.740- 18:57.280* :  And Mr. Miele accused Mr. Sanchez of undermining Spanish unity.
*18:57.760- 19:02.980* :  That was a reference to an amnesty deal with cat and separatists that helped secure his
*19:03.640- 19:04.780* :  minority government in power.
*19:04.780- 19:11.400* :  He accused him of jeopardizing Spain's middle class, alleging his policies led to poverty and death.
*19:11.400- 19:15.600* :  And he accused him of also jeopardizing Spanish women,
*19:16.060- 19:20.660* :  making without any evidence whatsoever, allegation that their physical integrity was at risk
*19:20.660- 19:22.860* :  because of his policies on illegal immigration.
*19:23.320- 19:27.660* :  And he urged Spanish people to reject socialist policies and models and choose
*19:28.060- 19:30.040* :  as he put it to live again in liberty.
*19:30.420- 19:33.740* :  So as Fred say, the Argentinian president has gone on the offensive,
*19:33.740- 19:37.100* :  how has the foreign ministry in Spain responded?
*19:37.460- 19:40.040* :  Well, they issued a fairly short statement in response.
*19:40.040- 19:42.400* :  They basically spoke of two things.
*19:42.400- 19:44.980* :  It flatly rejected President Miele's accusation,
*19:44.980- 19:50.020* :  but it moved swiftly on to say that the remarks didn't reflect relations between two
*19:50.020- 19:52.140* :  fraternal countries and peoples.
*19:52.640- 19:56.100* :  Now, he is, having Miele is expected to go to Spain in a couple of weeks,
*19:56.100- 19:58.080* :  could be a little frosty.
*19:58.540- 20:01.280* :  It could indeed, especially if he's meeting government figures.
*20:01.680- 20:05.960* :  And he's due to attend the party conference of the far-right Vox party in Spain.
*20:05.960- 20:10.960* :  It's expected to be an endorsement in many ways of the leader of Vox Santiago Abascal,
*20:10.960- 20:15.420* :  who attended Mr. Miele's own inauguration in December in Buenos Aires.
*20:15.880- 20:19.320* :  And all of this happens just ahead of the European Parliamentary elections
*20:19.760- 20:21.860* :  where the nationalist right is hoping to do well.
*20:22.180- 20:24.920* :  Now, both Spanish-speaking countries, are they normally close?
*20:25.500- 20:27.920* :  They are, there's long-standing tradition of Spain, obviously,
*20:27.920- 20:31.280* :  as the former colonial power, but there's long-standing cultural and historical
*20:31.280- 20:34.500* :  relations and also good trading relations as well.
*20:34.800- 20:38.360* :  So, although there's no love loss between the socialist-led government in Spain,
*20:38.360- 20:42.140* :  and Mr. Miele, who's a libertarian anarcho-caftalist,
*20:42.480- 20:44.580* :  who's a big cheerleader for Donald Trump,
*20:44.920- 20:49.280* :  the country's relations hopefully will survive these sort of ups and downs.
*20:49.680- 20:50.420* :  Danny Eberhard.
*20:53.080- 20:55.040* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*20:59.560- 21:04.200* :  The North Korean propaganda video, which has become surprisingly popular on TikTok.
*21:12.000- 21:16.420* :  Flexibility is great. That's why there's yoga. Flexibility for your insurance coverage is great,
*21:16.420- 21:19.400* :  too. That's why there's united healthcare insurance plans.
*21:19.880- 21:21.540* :  Underwritten by Golden Roll Insurance Company,

*22:17.460- 22:19.220* :  The Mayor of London is the most powerful,
*22:19.220- 22:21.500* :  directly elected politician in Britain.
*22:21.820- 22:26.220* :  The job served as a launch pad for Boris Johnson to eventually become Prime Minister.
*22:26.940- 22:30.360* :  Now, Sadiq Khan of the Opposition Labour Party has become the first
*22:30.500- 22:32.860* :  London Mayor to win a third term.
*22:33.640- 22:40.800* :  We ran a campaign that was in keeping with the spirit and values of this great city,
*22:41.220- 22:45.100* :  a city that regards our diversity, not as a weakness,
*22:45.960- 22:47.900* :  but an almighty strength.
*22:47.900- 22:55.180* :  And one, that rejects right, hard-wing populism and looks forward, not back.
*22:55.800- 23:02.100* :  Mr. Khan had already made history in 2016 as the first Muslim Mayor of any Western capital.
*23:02.760- 23:05.900* :  He hasn't always seen eye-to-eye with the rest of the Labour Party,
*23:05.900- 23:10.660* :  and has faced plenty of criticism over crime and his clean air policies in the capital.
*23:11.220- 23:14.020* :  But in the end, he did enough to secure a comfortable win.
*23:14.420- 23:18.580* :  I spoke to our political correspondent Rob Watson about the significance of the victory
*23:18.580- 23:20.420* :  for the main opposition party.
*23:20.920- 23:22.660* :  It had been a rather ugly campaign.
*23:22.660- 23:26.020* :  Essentially, his main rival was a woman called Susan Hall,
*23:26.020- 23:30.440* :  the Conservative candidate, very much on the right of the governing Conservative party.
*23:30.440- 23:34.200* :  And it has not been a pretty contest to put it mildly.
*23:34.420- 23:40.520* :  Now, London has, of course, seen huge protests over Israel's military operation in Gaza.
*23:40.520- 23:45.520* :  There had been suggestions that Labour's position on that conflict could reduce some of
*23:45.520- 23:49.060* :  city karnes votes, but they actually, well, overall, his share went up.
*23:49.600- 23:51.940* :  Yes, so that didn't materialise.
*23:51.960- 23:54.080* :  Neither did some other things that Labour were worried about.
*23:54.080- 23:58.500* :  They thought that maybe in people in London would be complacent of Labour winning just because
*23:58.500- 24:00.160* :  the poll suggested that he would win.
*24:00.160- 24:06.540* :  There was some concern about some of his policies aimed at lower missions in terms of cars and the sort of taxes
*24:07.200- 24:10.360* :  that they have to pay, but none of those fears materialised.
*24:10.400- 24:13.460* :  And he has reelected, and as you said, it's a pretty extraordinary
*24:13.460- 24:17.300* :  really to become the first mayor to have three terms as mayor of London.
*24:17.860- 24:22.160* :  There's a screaming message from these results, and that message is they confirm
*24:22.800- 24:25.260* :  what the polls have been suggesting for the last few months.
*24:25.260- 24:30.860* :  And that is that the governing Conservatives, Oliver, they are just spectacularly unpopular.
*24:31.120- 24:33.780* :  I mean, you just couldn't describe it any other way.
*24:33.780- 24:37.860* :  And what that means, of course, is unless that there's some utterly dramatic
*24:38.500- 24:43.880* :  turnaround in the Conservatives' fortunes, they seem to be heading for defeat in that general election,
*24:43.880- 24:47.940* :  which is expected sometime between now and January 2025.
*24:47.940- 24:52.460* :  That is absolutely the message, the unpopularity of the governing party.
*24:52.860- 24:54.740* :  Our political correspondent, Rob Watson.
*24:55.480- 25:00.800* :  A new documentary film called X Trillion about to be released globally highlights the worsening issue
*25:00.800- 25:05.060* :  of plastic pollution and how dangerous chemicals are getting into the human body.
*25:05.060- 25:10.340* :  An all-female crew travelled by boat to the most isolated parts of the North Pacific.
*25:11.020- 25:11.780* :  Here's an excerpt.
*25:13.020- 25:15.780* :  We've got an Albatross. It's just come to say hello,
*25:17.140- 25:22.700* :  and actually prefer to not see Albatross here, because you know that they're swooping down
*25:22.700- 25:27.960* :  onto the surface of the ocean, looking for squid, which basically look the same as
*25:27.960- 25:31.540* :  these white plastic fragments that we're seeing on the surface of the ocean.
*25:32.440- 25:35.320* :  The film's director, Eleanor Church, spoke to Paul Henley.
*25:36.060- 25:41.940* :  What we found was just this incredible, beautiful, blue, vast ocean, and every now and then we
*25:41.940- 25:47.480* :  did see a chair floating past, or a toothbrush, or a cigarette light, or something like that.
*25:47.880- 25:53.340* :  But then when we put a troll through the water, what we brought up were thousands and thousands
*25:53.340- 25:57.620* :  of tiny pieces of plastic, which ultimately had been something that someone on land,
*25:58.540- 26:03.160* :  hundreds of miles away, had used. But by the time it reached the North Pacific Choir,
*26:03.160- 26:08.320* :  which is also known as the Great Pacific Arbyspatch, had broken down because of the journey that
*26:08.320- 26:13.540* :  had travelled and been bashed around by the waves and the sun breaking it down to these tiny,
*26:13.540- 26:17.580* :  tiny particles of plastic, which are actually our biggest threat, because ultimately the big
*26:17.580- 26:24.500* :  bits of plastic, you can go and scoop up. But we found, on average, half a million pieces of
*26:24.500- 26:28.420* :  microplastics on the surface of the water in a square kilometre.
*26:28.560- 26:31.960* :  And the point is, these microplastics are finding their way into us.
*26:32.760- 26:37.800* :  Exactly, so I think there's more and more research that shows that we're breathing in microplastics,
*26:37.800- 26:42.760* :  or nanoplastics, that we're ingesting it through our food, through the water we drink,
*26:42.760- 26:47.100* :  through all sorts of different ways. Also, plastics have their lipophilic qualities, so they
*26:47.100- 26:51.440* :  attract pollutants that we have in our water systems already, such as flame retardants,
*26:51.440- 26:57.240* :  or fertilizers, or pesticides, and they bio-accumulate in our bodies. The point of the expedition
*26:57.560- 27:02.600* :  and of the film, really, is to make people think about what we can all do in different ways,
*27:02.600- 27:05.360* :  and it's actually very optimistic and uplifting film.
*27:05.540- 27:06.980* :  What was it actually like on board?
*27:07.420- 27:11.360* :  It was extraordinary. Some nights, you know, there'd be phosphorescence on the crests of
*27:11.360- 27:14.760* :  every wave, for as far as you could see, and a million stars in the sky, and other nights.
*27:15.440- 27:22.060* :  It was, you know, storms, lightning, terrifying, but it was a very unique experience to go to one
*27:22.060- 27:26.120* :  of the most remote places in the world. But we were closer to people on a space station above us,
*27:26.160- 27:31.620* :  and we were to people on land. We didn't see another boat for three weeks. It was just an extraordinary
*27:31.620- 27:38.460* :  thing to be so far away from civilization, but ultimately surrounded by all of this plastic and
*27:38.460- 27:45.140* :  traces of humanity. And then the church, talking to Paul Henley. In Scotland, whiskey distilleries
*27:45.140- 27:50.340* :  that had closed decades ago are now being reopened, thanks to a rise in global consumption,
*27:50.340- 27:55.100* :  and a multi-million dollar investment by the drinks giant Diagio. They've been called
*27:55.100- 28:00.420* :  ghost distilleries, and many specialise in producing whiskeys made from a single malt grain.
*28:00.420- 28:05.560* :  Some connoisseurs argue they have far better flavour than more widely sold blended ones.
*28:05.560- 28:10.760* :  Our reporter Elizabeth Hotson visited one of the most famous distilleries to be revived in the
*28:10.760- 28:18.880* :  western Scottish island of Isla. What springs to mind when you hear the words liquid gold?
*28:19.320- 28:24.880* :  Oil perhaps? Well, I'm going to tell you a tale about a far more palatable and equally finite
*28:24.880- 28:31.340* :  resource, and that's whiskey, from Scotland's fabled ghost distilleries. Back in the 1980s,
*28:31.340- 28:36.120* :  an oversupply of whiskey resulted in whiskey locks and dozens of distilleries were closed.
*28:36.180- 28:42.180* :  One of these was Portellin on the Isle of Isla in the west of Scotland, and then around the
*28:42.180- 28:47.660* :  start of the millennium something happened. Tastes and market conditions changed and whiskey
*28:47.660- 28:54.040* :  became fashionable, and as the popularity of alcohol from ghost distillers grew, so did the prices.
*28:54.820- 29:00.620* :  For example, a bottle of Portellin, which you might have paid, say, $100 for back in the mid-1990s,
*29:00.840- 29:06.620* :  could now easily fetch thousands of dollars. And although it hasn't produced any liquids
*29:06.620- 29:11.960* :  since the early 80s, it's kept some of the whiskey made before it closed. And those casks
*29:11.960- 29:15.840* :  hold some of the most highly priced tipples, according to you and Gunn,
*29:15.840- 29:20.520* :  global brand ambassador for Diaggio's luxury portfolio of Scotch whiskeys.
*29:20.740- 29:25.660* :  One of those of knock-on benefits from that downturn was that we had stocks that was maturing
*29:25.660- 29:31.060* :  to a much higher age than it may have been allowed to if we'd been producing at the same levels,
*29:31.620- 29:36.800* :  which ultimately led to us being in a position where we have things like 44-year-old Portellin
*29:36.800- 29:45.300* :  Gemini. Gemini is sold as a two-bottle set, which will cost you $55,000. Now that's partly down
*29:45.300- 29:51.280* :  to rarity and partly down to just sheer demand. And as the clamour for liquid from ghost distilleries
*29:51.280- 29:56.500* :  has reached fever pitch, some of their owners have decided to resurrect those legacy brands.
*29:56.640- 30:01.660* :  Names like Brawler and Rosebank have risen from the ashes, and in March this year,
*30:01.980- 30:07.200* :  Portellin was reopened by its parent company Diaggio after a 41-year slumber.
*30:07.540- 30:13.320* :  And I was one of a fortunate group of journalists to witness the celebrations in person. A sample
*30:13.320- 30:18.320* :  of liquid older than myself was drawn from the cask and poured into a glass. But what are the
*30:18.320- 30:22.800* :  new stuff the distilleries making? Will they succeed in replicating the glories of the past?
*30:22.800- 30:28.720* :  In all likelihood, it'll be more than a decade before a single malt is bottled. So until then,
*30:28.720- 30:34.820* :  the ghostly and very expensive last drops from the distilleries' previous life will continue
*30:34.820- 30:40.440* :  to be drunk and enjoyed by people with even deeper pockets. Elizabeth Hotson reporting from
*30:40.440- 30:47.060* :  Eila in Western Scotland. North Korea is fiercely opposed to western popular culture,
*30:47.060- 30:53.080* :  even invoking the death penalty to try to stamp out foreign influence. But now a North Korean
*30:53.080- 30:58.160* :  propaganda song, praising the nation's leader Kim Jong-un, has gone viral on TikTok,
*30:58.260- 31:03.180* :  uses around the world have been sharing, commenting on, and even remixing the tune,
*31:03.780- 31:05.020* :  as Will Leonardo reports.
*31:10.260- 31:14.920* :  Abo coded. That's how TikTok fans have been describing the synthy electro-sounding latest
*31:14.920- 31:20.840* :  release from Pyongyang's propaganda ministry. It's replete with video with the North Korean
*31:20.840- 31:25.520* :  leader greeting well wishes, soldiers dancing on top of tanks, schoolchildren clapping their hands,
*31:25.520- 31:29.500* :  and doctors giving a thumbs up in the operating theatre. lyrics include,
*31:29.500- 31:34.120* :  let's brag about Kim Jong-un, our friendly father. Now of course, this is a man whose
*31:34.120- 31:37.940* :  promise to annihilate the country where many TikTok viewers will be watching this video,
*31:37.940- 31:41.780* :  the United States. But that hasn't stopped it from gaining a massive following.
*31:42.300- 31:43.180* :  User comments include,
*31:43.180- 31:47.680* :  this slaps, and its so-called success has even been compared to Taylor Swift's new release.
*31:48.460- 31:52.320* :  Experts researching North Korean music say the tune is a classic of the genre.
*31:52.740- 31:56.780* :  Simple lyrics and melodies pitched at vocal ranges most people are able to reach.
*31:57.180- 32:01.940* :  It's also researchers say emblematic of the complete control the communist authorities have
*32:01.940- 32:06.340* :  over artistic output in North Korea, where creative freedom is more or less not existent,
*32:06.680- 32:11.480* :  and citizens wake up every day to the sound of propaganda music being blasted over loudspeakers.
*32:12.120- 32:16.220* :  But it's a different story abroad when no one, not even the great leader of North Korea,
*32:16.560- 32:21.480* :  is safe from an army of social media users who've perfected the art of trivialising political
*32:21.480- 32:26.440* :  grandstanding. TikTokers have been remixing the song by overlaying AI vocals,
*32:26.760- 32:30.220* :  including with those from an internet sensation the Chinese model Jaffe.
*32:37.360- 32:40.440* :  Indeed, Kim Jong-un's image is never far from an internet meme.
*32:40.440- 32:43.520* :  His idiosyncratic fashion choices have been poured over,
*32:43.520- 32:47.820* :  spawning articles about his sandals, and social media posts joking that he would love
*32:47.820- 32:51.600* :  the Swedish designer Kaws, known for its flowy, oversized clothing.
*32:52.260- 32:56.720* :  This episode is also a sign of how TikTok is able to launch obscure pieces of audio and
*32:56.720- 33:00.840* :  video to prominence overnight. The world wouldn't have battered an eyelid at another North
*33:00.840- 33:05.060* :  Korea propaganda video if it weren't for the app's users. But whether Pyongyang's
*33:05.060- 33:09.180* :  propagandaists will see this as getting their intended message across seems doubtful.
*33:14.340- 33:15.760* :  A report by Will Leonardo.
*33:18.420- 33:22.480* :  A man is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
