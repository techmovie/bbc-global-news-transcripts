*01:24.340- 01:25.440* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:25.440- 01:27.360* :  This edition is published in the early hours of first
*01:27.360- 01:28.600* :  the 30th of May.
*01:28.600- 01:32.780* :  The jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial is considering its verdict.
*01:33.520- 01:36.440* :  Israel says it's gained military control of the strip of land
*01:36.440- 01:38.180* :  along the Gaza-Egypt border
*01:38.780- 01:41.200* :  and counting is underway in the South African election
*01:41.200- 01:44.320* :  the biggest test for the ANC since the end of apartheid.
*01:46.820- 01:49.740* :  Also in the podcast, evidence that ancient Egyptians
*01:49.840- 01:53.480* :  may have tried to treat cancer more than 4,000 years ago.
*01:53.840- 01:57.180* :  And my boss said, go out and everybody stop work
*01:57.220- 01:58.820* :  and run out very fast.
*01:59.140- 02:02.700* :  And oh, my heart almost stressful.
*02:02.700- 02:03.180* :  Yeah.
*02:04.060- 02:07.760* :  A new volcanic eruption in Iceland forces thousands to evacuate.
*02:12.940- 02:16.500* :  Although it is seen as the least serious of the four criminal cases
*02:16.500- 02:19.860* :  facing Donald Trump, the hush money trial in New York
*02:19.860- 02:21.840* :  will go down in US history
*02:22.260- 02:25.380* :  as the first involving a sitting or former American president.
*02:26.100- 02:29.900* :  Mr. Trump has accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records
*02:29.900- 02:33.040* :  to cover up a payment to the porn actress Stormy Daniels
*02:33.320- 02:35.480* :  in the 2016 election campaign.
*02:35.480- 02:39.600* :  The outcome, which could have an impact on the presidential election this November,
*02:39.600- 02:43.880* :  now rests with the jury, which has completed its deliberations for the day.
*02:44.140- 02:48.220* :  Speaking outside court, Mr. Trump didn't sound very hopeful.
*02:48.720- 02:51.020* :  Mother Teresa could not be these charges.
*02:51.840- 02:53.220* :  These charges are rigged.
*02:53.480- 02:54.740* :  The whole thing is rigged.
*02:55.420- 02:59.080* :  The whole country is a mess between the borders and fake elections.
*02:59.080- 03:03.860* :  And you have a trial like this where the judges are so conflicted.
*03:03.860- 03:04.640* :  He can't breathe.
*03:05.500- 03:06.540* :  He's got to do his job.
*03:07.280- 03:08.940* :  It's not for me that I can tell you.
*03:09.740- 03:10.460* :  It's a disgrace.
*03:11.580- 03:14.300* :  Our correspondent, Edith Alfik, has been following developments
*03:14.300- 03:16.380* :  from outside the court in New York.
*03:16.380- 03:21.080* :  She told James Menendez the jury had asked to have another look at some of the evidence.
*03:21.660- 03:22.440* :  There was a buzzer.
*03:22.440- 03:25.380* :  There was a note from jurors that they want to see testimony.
*03:25.380- 03:27.120* :  They want it read back to them.
*03:27.580- 03:32.960* :  Now, part of that is from a Trump Tower meeting in August of 2015.
*03:32.960- 03:36.260* :  They want to read both David Peckers testimony.
*03:36.260- 03:39.620* :  That's the former publisher of the tabloid, the National Inquirer.
*03:40.000- 03:42.920* :  And Michael Cohen's testimony regarding that meeting.
*03:42.920- 03:45.320* :  He is, of course, Trump's former fixer.
*03:45.700- 03:48.900* :  And the reason why that meeting is important is because that's when prosecutors
*03:48.900- 03:54.780* :  said the coal catch and kill scheme as they put it was formulated.
*03:54.780- 04:01.220* :  Where the National Inquirer would buy up stories and kill them, not have them published,
*04:01.220- 04:05.000* :  in order to help Donald Trump's campaign to get him into the White House.
*04:05.000- 04:10.180* :  And prosecutors say that was a key part of the conspiracy that was later covered up.
*04:10.720- 04:14.640* :  Now, prosecutors will perhaps be happy to see that the jury is
*04:15.000- 04:17.060* :  taking their job very seriously.
*04:17.060- 04:21.720* :  They're looking at this because they had described in their closing arguments David Peckers
*04:21.720- 04:28.140* :  testimony as devastating and something that can stand on its own apart from Michael Cohen.
*04:28.780- 04:34.900* :  jurors also want to see Peckers testimony regarding a phone conversation with Donald Trump
*04:34.900- 04:40.740* :  while Peckers was in an investor meeting and also testimony from Peckers when he decided
*04:40.780- 04:46.640* :  to finalize buying the life rights of the Playboy model Karen McDougall.
*04:47.120- 04:53.200* :  So again, testimony, key parts of it from the first witness in this case for the prosecution,
*04:53.200- 04:54.160* :  David Peckers.
*04:54.380- 04:57.860* :  What did the judge tell the jurors before they went out?
*04:58.520- 05:03.720* :  He gave them some of the standard instructions that they need to not take any bias against
*05:03.720- 05:07.800* :  Donald Trump into account. They have to just look at the facts of the case that they have to
*05:07.800- 05:12.940* :  reach a unanimous decision so to listen carefully to each other's opinions and really take that
*05:12.940- 05:18.240* :  into deep consideration. But then he also spoke about the law at work here. He said they have to find
*05:18.240- 05:24.640* :  not only that Donald Trump falsified business records himself or with others, but that he tried
*05:24.640- 05:28.900* :  to conceal another crime. He says those two parts are necessary to convict Donald Trump.
*05:29.460- 05:31.560* :  Neda Taufig outside court in New York.
*05:32.400- 05:36.940* :  The Israeli army says it now has full operational control of the Philadelphia
*05:36.940- 05:42.220* :  Corridor, a 14-kilometer strip of land that runs along Gaza's southern border.
*05:42.880- 05:47.100* :  The military believes that as a result, Hamas can no longer smuggle in weapons through tunnels
*05:47.100- 05:52.940* :  under the frontier with Egypt. Despite this, a senior Israeli security official says he expects
*05:52.940- 05:58.600* :  fighting in Gaza to continue until at least the end of the year. For more on the significance of
*05:58.600- 06:02.640* :  the latest Israeli operation, we heard from our Middle East analyst Sebastien Asher.
*06:03.060- 06:08.180* :  It was only a week or two ago that as part of the offensive in Raffa, the Israeli army has
*06:08.180- 06:15.100* :  launched. They took over the actual border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. And now they've taken
*06:15.100- 06:22.500* :  over this zone which basically runs along the border. Part of a reason, I think, is to do with
*06:22.560- 06:29.440* :  trying to degrade the ability of Hamas to keep its supply of weapons going. I mean, as you were
*06:29.440- 06:33.720* :  saying, the Israeli military says that they found around 20 tunnels. Now, those tunnels,
*06:33.720- 06:40.180* :  are kind of a known secret, if one can call it that. I mean, Israel has said for a long time
*06:40.180- 06:45.960* :  that that's one of the routes that Hamas has been able to get weapons into Gaza from now Egypt.
*06:46.520- 06:52.760* :  On the other side of the border has already denied this since the statement was made by the Israeli
*06:52.760- 06:59.000* :  military spokesman. I mean, those tunnels, such as they have been used certainly to bring
*06:59.020- 07:05.400* :  food and other sorts of supplies into Gaza from outside, as has happened in other parts of the
*07:05.400- 07:13.080* :  enclave. An Egypt itself has often done things to block those tunnels. So this is quite a sore
*07:13.080- 07:19.040* :  point between Israel and Egypt. I think this will develop in relations between Israel and Egypt
*07:19.060- 07:24.540* :  have been really getting pretty poor as the offensive has continued and as it's come right to
*07:24.540- 07:30.200* :  the border. So that's one element. And another interesting thing, I think, that the military spokesman
*07:30.200- 07:36.280* :  was saying is that Israel is claiming that Hamas had put some of its rocket launches right
*07:36.280- 07:43.260* :  almost on the border with Egypt, like 10 meters away, thinking that Israel would not target them
*07:43.340- 07:47.740* :  because there'd be the danger of overshooting into Egypt, which of course would be another whole
*07:47.740- 07:53.160* :  headache. And we did have reports just two or three days ago of rockets being fired, I think,
*07:53.160- 07:59.480* :  eight into the center of Israel the first time for several months. And that's where I think that
*07:59.480- 08:05.240* :  they were fired from. So yes, this is certainly being presented by Israel as quite a big achievement.
*08:05.240- 08:10.840* :  And there's another kind of justification for its big military operation in Raffa.
*08:11.300- 08:16.460* :  On Middle East analyst Sebastian Asha, counting is underway in the South African election in the
*08:16.460- 08:21.780* :  biggest test for the African National Congress since the end of apartheid. The party could lose
*08:21.780- 08:27.480* :  its majority in parliament for the first time since Nelson Mandela became president in 1994.
*08:27.740- 08:33.160* :  Support has waned against a backdrop of corruption, rising crime and power shortages.
*08:33.820- 08:39.580* :  This photo in Pretoria, 34-year-old Maniane Mkorsi, said frustration had compelled him to cast
*08:39.580- 08:43.920* :  his ballot for the first time. I was like, I can't really see and watch what's been happening
*08:43.920- 08:48.800* :  in our country in terms of the service delivery and everything because rules and infrastructure
*08:48.800- 08:53.280* :  everything is a mess in South Africa at the moment. So I was like, okay, what can I do to make a
*08:53.280- 08:58.520* :  difference? I got an update on how voting had gone from our Africa correspondent Barbara Platt Asha
*08:58.620- 09:04.020* :  at a counting center. There were some hiccups, a number of polling stations opened late because
*09:04.020- 09:09.060* :  of technical difficulties or because ballots took a while to be delivered but not a huge number
*09:09.060- 09:15.200* :  around seven percent of them. So I think mostly it went smoothly. Quite a lot of people came out
*09:15.200- 09:19.500* :  what we've heard from the election commission is that it looks as if the turnout was higher than
*09:19.500- 09:24.540* :  it was in the last election in 2019, which is quite something because the numbers had been declining
*09:24.620- 09:29.880* :  and there was a late surge as well as we were leaving a polling station and driving through
*09:29.880- 09:35.600* :  the city we could see lines like down the streets and a number of places. Yeah, those lines
*09:35.620- 09:40.540* :  meant they had to keep some of the polling stations open a little later. Does the fact that there
*09:40.540- 09:45.500* :  was or appears to have been a high turnout? Does that give us any indication of which way the vote
*09:45.500- 09:51.140* :  might have gone in terms of the ANC's fortunes? Well, the sort of rule of thumb that the analysts
*09:51.140- 09:57.140* :  were using was if it's a higher turnout it's probably less good for the governing ANC party
*09:57.140- 10:03.120* :  because it might give more votes to the rival parties but that's not scientific in any way we're
*10:03.120- 10:08.360* :  really going to have to see. I can tell you from the voters that I spoke to, broadly speaking,
*10:08.360- 10:14.600* :  the older ones did tend to be more loyal to the ANC because of its liberation legacy and also
*10:14.600- 10:19.760* :  because they were wary that new parties would do a worse job than the ANC has in terms of the
*10:19.760- 10:25.360* :  economy and corruption scandals and so on. Younger voters, some of whom didn't experience a partake
*10:25.360- 10:29.420* :  were much more critical and I spoke to a number of them who were clearly going to vote for other
*10:29.420- 10:34.040* :  parties and jobs for them was a really big thing because more than 40% of the youth are unemployed.
*10:34.040- 10:37.700* :  There was certainly a sense that people were looking for something different,
*10:38.260- 10:42.960* :  some looking for the ANC to fix things and some saying that the ANC just simply needed to be replaced.
*10:43.560- 10:49.880* :  And if the ANC doesn't get a majority as some expect, what should we look out for which are
*10:49.880- 10:54.400* :  the other parties that they might have to do a deal with? It very much depends on numbers.
*10:54.460- 11:02.100* :  If the ANC comes close to 50% of the vote, then it could strike an easier deal with smaller parties.
*11:02.100- 11:07.640* :  If it falls quite a bit below 50%, then it would have to rely on the larger parties,
*11:07.640- 11:14.000* :  its rivals. So that could force policy trade-offs and there aren't really easy options. On the right,
*11:14.000- 11:19.980* :  you have the largest opposition party, the pro-business democratic alliance, but it really struggles to
*11:19.980- 11:24.860* :  shake off its image as a party for the white minority. So that's kind of like an unlikely coalition.
*11:25.280- 11:29.020* :  Do you have the economic freedom fighters, which these radical solutions via economy,
*11:29.680- 11:33.100* :  nationalizing minds and banks and expropriating land from white farmers and so on?
*11:33.740- 11:38.700* :  Also not an easy coalition partner. So it would be uncharted territory if the ANC lost quite a
*11:38.700- 11:42.980* :  lot of percentage of the vote and could potentially lead to some instability and governing.
*11:42.980- 11:47.980* :  Although having said that, perhaps a coalition would make South Africans feel they can better hold
*11:47.980- 11:52.000* :  their leaders accountable, certainly that's the sense one got at the voting booths today,
*11:52.000- 11:57.520* :  than if a single party dominates. And when we get a good idea of how the voting is actually going?
*11:57.840- 12:04.000* :  Well, the counting has already started. We'll possibly get a sense of early results by
*12:04.340- 12:07.720* :  sometime on Friday and then the full results sometime at the weekend.
*12:11.100- 12:16.240* :  The ancient Egyptians may have had a greater medical understanding than one might think.
*12:16.240- 12:21.100* :  Researchers in Europe say that Marx and cuts on a more than 4,000-year-old skull
*12:21.820- 12:26.740* :  suggest they were trying to treat cancer. Edgard Kameros led the research, which has been
*12:26.740- 12:30.740* :  published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. He spoke to Tim Franks.
*12:31.140- 12:38.420* :  What we saw is not just the lesion of a cancer or of a neoplasic pathology, but it's also the
*12:38.420- 12:43.740* :  evidence that more than 4,000 years ago during the period that we know the ancient Egyptians,
*12:44.540- 12:49.360* :  they performed a surgical intervention. They is actually quite a milestone in the history of
*12:49.360- 12:55.220* :  medicine, because it's telling us that these people had some kind of interest in trying to understand
*12:55.220- 13:00.440* :  and maybe who knows trying to treat cancer. And you think it was surgery? You think it was
*13:00.440- 13:05.440* :  treatment? You don't think this was an autopsy? Well, we know for sure it was an oncological surgery.
*13:05.940- 13:12.120* :  However, the cut marks, we cannot scientifically say they were made with the patient alive,
*13:12.120- 13:18.960* :  or with the individual already dead. And that's why we call them perimotum cut marks. However,
*13:18.960- 13:24.140* :  that's very interesting in both of these scenarios, because if the individual was alive,
*13:24.140- 13:29.500* :  then that's probably a surgical intervention, maybe searching for some kind of treatment.
*13:29.580- 13:35.100* :  However, if the individual was already dead, that might be related with some kind of medical
*13:35.100- 13:41.600* :  autopsy, some kind of exploratory intervention. However, in both of the cases, it is certainly
*13:41.600- 13:47.300* :  surgical intervention in relation to that tumor. And how did you know that there was a tumor there?
*13:47.720- 13:51.720* :  What makes you certain that it was cancer? We've performed some microsity,
*13:51.720- 13:57.560* :  tac scans. We did also some microscopic observations. And the features that we found on those
*13:57.560- 14:03.740* :  lesions, their bone pathologies are very, very characteristic of what we nowadays call cancer,
*14:03.740- 14:10.100* :  or neoplastic diseases. And that's why our diagnosis is related with cancer. We do tend to
*14:10.100- 14:17.620* :  think of cancers as being a more recent type of disease. So is that important, do you think?
*14:18.060- 14:22.420* :  That's important. And it's true that people tend to think that cancer is a modern disease.
*14:22.640- 14:29.480* :  However, we obviously know that cancer is related to life. It's related to multicellular life.
*14:29.480- 14:35.840* :  So actually, cancer has been with life since the very beginning of it. But it's true that the
*14:35.840- 14:41.300* :  incidence of cancer is very, very high nowadays. However, the more we look into our past,
*14:41.820- 14:45.440* :  the more we find that cancer was really a prevalent disease.
*14:45.780- 14:51.240* :  The Egyptians, I mean, I think we knew that they were quite advanced when it came to medicine.
*14:51.240- 14:57.100* :  But this presumably would be a big leap forward in that. It is a leap forward. But actually,
*14:57.100- 15:01.780* :  it's interesting to think that there's a context for these surgical intervention. And that's the
*15:01.780- 15:07.920* :  very advanced and sophisticated ancient Egyptian medicine. We've got, for example, the papyrus,
*15:07.920- 15:12.560* :  which is a different kind of source rather than bones to try and understand this kind of medicine.
*15:12.560- 15:19.460* :  And those papyrus, for example, the Edgwyn Smith papyrus, which dates about 3,600 years ago,
*15:20.140- 15:27.280* :  they already describe 48 cases of different conditions, but the very interesting case is number 45,
*15:27.280- 15:34.080* :  which it seems is describing a breast cancer. And the fascinating thing is that whenever they try
*15:34.080- 15:39.420* :  and say, what could have been the treatment for that, they say, there's no cure. There's no treatment
*15:39.420- 15:44.280* :  available for that. And this is interesting because although there's amazing medicine,
*15:44.980- 15:49.720* :  they really have this frontier in their medical knowledge when it comes to what we nowadays call
*15:49.720- 15:55.000* :  cancer. But they did identify tumors, et cetera. Professor Edgar at Cameras from the University of
*15:55.000- 16:01.280* :  Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Iceland is, once again, witnessing the raw power of nature,
*16:01.280- 16:06.980* :  as a volcano erupts on 50 kilometers southwest of the capital Reykjavík, a wall of molten
*16:06.980- 16:11.520* :  rock is shooting high into the air along a three-kilometer crack in the Earth's surface.
*16:12.000- 16:16.740* :  And what the authorities say is the biggest eruption there of recent times. Stephanie's
*16:16.740- 16:24.760* :  Agresson reports. Helicopter footage shows plumes of grey smoke billowing into the air
*16:25.200- 16:31.380* :  and a long crack from which glowing red lava spews. The authorities had warned of the risk of
*16:31.380- 16:37.220* :  renewed volcanic activity in the area, just south of the capital Reykjavík, a studies had showed
*16:37.220- 16:42.920* :  that magma had accumulases underground. Dicpy are the sun heads, the Nordic Volcanological Center
*16:42.920- 16:49.360* :  at the University of Iceland. She says the next 24 hours will determine how this eruption progresses.
*16:49.980- 16:56.160* :  Right now it's a continuous curtain of fire. As it develops with time, it will focus into certain
*16:56.160- 17:03.300* :  points and eventually often only one or two craters will be active on the long run, but we can't
*17:03.300- 17:08.500* :  say that by now. We're only observing the initial phase. It's the fifth volcanic eruption in the
*17:08.500- 17:14.560* :  area in six months, and although it's in an uninhabited part of Iceland, it's northeast of the
*17:14.560- 17:20.520* :  fishing town of Grindervik, where residents have once again had to evacuate. Patrothip networks are
*17:20.520- 17:25.460* :  a fish processing plant in the town and spoke to journalists as she and her colleagues left.
*17:25.460- 17:31.440* :  My boss said go out and everybody stop work and run out from the work and go to the car and
*17:31.800- 17:39.620* :  I don't have a choice and I come with my clothes and everyone out very fast and oh, my heart
*17:40.300- 17:47.680* :  almost stretched out. The nearby Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist spot, was also close to visitors.
*17:47.680- 17:53.920* :  There are more than 30 active volcano systems in Iceland. This cinematographer Benjamin Hardman,
*17:53.920- 17:59.200* :  who moved to the island to capture its fascinating natural life, has been documenting volcanic
*17:59.200- 18:04.420* :  activity for several years. He was filming just a few hundred meters from the eruption.
*18:04.800- 18:10.560* :  This is a strange time when the raken us peninsula after 800 years. The volcanic system in the
*18:10.560- 18:16.760* :  area are actually several of them have worked. The general feeling of excitement has kind of shifted
*18:16.760- 18:21.620* :  as the eruptions move closer to the town of Grindervik and right on the north side of the town,
*18:21.620- 18:26.840* :  causing widespread evacuation of that town and people to relocate themselves permanently.
*18:27.320- 18:33.740* :  It has also reached some of the defensive walls built around Grindervik and nearby U.S. Navy
*18:33.740- 18:41.640* :  communication towers. That was Stephanie Zacherson. Still to come on the global news podcast.

*20:15.180- 20:20.660* :  More than two years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, much of the economy is struggling,
*20:20.660- 20:26.880* :  not least the hospitality sector. One notable casualty is the hotel Ukraine in Kiev.
*20:27.400- 20:32.880* :  The Soviet era block which has more than 350 rooms is now being auctioned off by the state
*20:32.880- 20:36.780* :  with proceeds going to the war effort. As Isabella Jewel explains.
*20:37.700- 20:44.920* :  Since 1961 hotel Ukraine has borne witness to key moments of Ukrainian history. Not only did it
*20:44.920- 20:49.820* :  weather the transition from the Soviet era to the country's independence in the 90s,
*20:50.180- 20:56.480* :  it also overlooks independence square. The site of the bloody maiden revolution in 2014,
*20:56.480- 21:01.360* :  which led to the outsting of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovic.
*21:04.320- 21:09.300* :  More recently, of course, it has sheltered guests including visiting politicians from Russia's
*21:09.300- 21:20.420* :  full-scale invasion. On its websites, the four-star hotel boasts a fully equipped bomb bunker and
*21:20.420- 21:25.440* :  air alert system, as well as a panoramic view from the higher floors on quieter nights.
*21:26.020- 21:31.800* :  But the time has come for yet another transition. Having been under state ownership for more than 30
*21:31.800- 21:37.680* :  years, the government has decided to part with Kiev's most famous hotel. Despite its
*21:37.680- 21:43.600* :  impressive appearance, the establishment's profits have tumbles. It's now in more than a million
*21:43.600- 21:49.040* :  dollars of debt. The tourist just ends coming, understandably put off by Russia's war.
*21:51.660- 21:55.600* :  The neo-Gothic building and all of its memorabilia will be auctioned off,
*21:55.980- 22:01.440* :  and the proceeds funneled into Ukraine's war chest. The starting price? More than 30 million
*22:01.980- 22:06.200* :  dollars. Since the beginning of the war, rumours have swirled about the fate of the hotel.
*22:06.200- 22:11.020* :  Its location next to the president's office makes it a strategic target.
*22:11.620- 22:16.680* :  But it has managed to stay in Ukraine's control, hosting regular conferences on the war and the
*22:16.680- 22:22.080* :  country's reconstruction efforts, as well as a high-profile Chinese delegation last year.
*22:22.080- 22:27.260* :  The State Property Fund says there's already been interest, including from foreign operators.
*22:27.840- 22:31.140* :  The sale is expected to take place later this year.
*22:31.540- 22:37.540* :  Isabella Jewel. Columbia has approved a ban on bullfighting, marking a significant victory
*22:37.540- 22:42.780* :  for animal rights activists. Columbia is one of only eight countries where bullfighting still
*22:42.780- 22:48.400* :  takes place. The others being France, Portugal, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Spain and Venezuela.
*22:48.460- 22:53.840* :  The BBC's Latin America online editor, Vanessa Bushlutter, told Luke Jones why
*22:53.840- 22:58.980* :  Columbia had decided to do this now. For the last ten years or so, there have been a lot of
*22:58.980- 23:04.760* :  people who have been advocating for an end to bullfights. They say that it is incredibly cruel,
*23:04.760- 23:10.400* :  and they have long fought for this on various platforms trying to get the Constitutional Court
*23:10.400- 23:15.680* :  to ban it, and more recently to get Congress to ban it. And that's what's now happened.
*23:15.720- 23:20.780* :  The Constitutional Court basically put the ball into the Court of Congress and said you have to
*23:20.780- 23:28.060* :  legislate on this. So we've had a vote now and the vast majority, 93 delegates out of 95 voted
*23:28.060- 23:33.660* :  for a ban and only two against, but there's going to be a transition period of about three years
*23:34.220- 23:39.160* :  because that allows the government to give people who have been making a living from
*23:39.160- 23:46.820* :  bullfight to find other sources of income. And this is why in the past attempts to have a ban
*23:46.820- 23:51.280* :  passed through Congress failed because there were many people who said, look, in my constituency,
*23:51.280- 23:56.820* :  there's people who live from this, not just the people who breed bulls, who work on the farms,
*23:56.820- 24:02.660* :  that breed bulls, but also the street vendors. I mean, these are huge events where thousands of
*24:02.660- 24:08.040* :  people are crammed to historic bull rings in major cities. And so you've got a whole industry
*24:08.040- 24:12.740* :  built around this. Yeah, and it's amazing that even with that three-year transition period,
*24:12.900- 24:17.500* :  there must still be people who will be out of pocket annoyed by this. I mean, what do you even do
*24:17.500- 24:22.080* :  with those historic bull rings that you mentioned? Absolutely. Well, the historic bull rings the idea
*24:22.080- 24:28.660* :  is to turn them into venues that can host sporting events and concerts. So that is less of a problem,
*24:28.660- 24:34.520* :  but what the officials of bullfighting are saying is that it's an art form. They don't even see it
*24:34.520- 24:41.380* :  as a sport, but that is being lost. So they're seeing it as a threat to their way of life. And of
*24:41.380- 24:47.020* :  course, many of the farmers who've read these beautiful fighting bulls say that if there's no
*24:47.020- 24:52.760* :  need for them, that will also be lost. Vanessa Bouchluta are Latin America online editor.
*24:53.620- 24:59.700* :  It has been dubbed a Nigerian game of thrones. The northwestern city of Kano currently has two
*24:59.700- 25:05.480* :  rival amirs sitting in separate palaces a few kilometers apart. The authorities of banned
*25:05.480- 25:11.020* :  protests and rallies over fears that the royal spat could turn violent. Richard Hamilton is
*25:11.020- 25:16.180* :  following the story. Yes, it's a family power struggle over who should be the rightful air. When
*25:16.180- 25:24.580* :  the old Amir, the previous one died in 2014, he was not succeeded by his son, Aminu Ado Bayeru,
*25:24.980- 25:31.240* :  but the Kingmakers decided his great nephew, Mohamedu Sanussi, would take over. And this has been
*25:31.240- 25:36.820* :  a source of contention and it led to violent clashes at the time. And then four years ago, the
*25:36.820- 25:43.540* :  governor of Kano deposed Mr. Sanussi and installed Mr. Bayeru, and now the new governor has
*25:43.540- 25:49.080* :  restored Mr. Sanussi to the throne. Meanwhile, Mr. Bayeru has returned and declared himself
*25:49.080- 25:54.840* :  the legitimate Amir. On Tuesday, the federal court of Nigeria ordered that Mr. Sanussi
*25:54.840- 26:00.340* :  should be evicted, but a state court went the other way and restrained the police from carrying it
*26:00.340- 26:06.460* :  out. Do amirs have much power in Nigeria? No, they don't have much political power,
*26:06.460- 26:12.620* :  but they have huge ceremonial traditional role, their custodians of religion and culture,
*26:12.620- 26:19.120* :  their spiritual leaders, they have huge following and influence. The Amir of Kano is the second
*26:19.120- 26:26.380* :  most senior Muslim leader in Nigeria after the Sultan of Sokato, and this role goes back to pre-colonial
*26:26.380- 26:31.600* :  times before the creation of the modern state of Nigeria when it was divided up into lots of
*26:31.600- 26:37.340* :  kingdoms. But because of their influence, politicians are keen to exploit their influence.
*26:37.380- 26:42.760* :  So the governors and political parties have taken over, and it's really a power struggle
*26:43.220- 26:49.740* :  for politics as well. So Mr. Sanussi is linked to the NNPP party which controls the governorship,
*26:49.740- 26:55.840* :  but Mr. Bayeru is backed by President Tanubu's governing APC party. So this power struggle,
*26:55.840- 27:01.080* :  which was a family struggle is now a political one as well. Richard Hamilton.
*27:01.760- 27:06.880* :  Now, despite all the hype about it, a new survey suggests that very few people are actually
*27:06.880- 27:14.840* :  using artificial intelligence products like chat GPT. Researchers surveyed 12,000 people in
*27:14.840- 27:20.520* :  six countries, including the UK, where only 2% of respondents said they employ such tools
*27:20.520- 27:25.340* :  on a daily basis. Our technology editor Zoe Kleinman has been looking at the research.
*27:26.000- 27:30.740* :  I'm probably not the typical AI customer to represent this particular study, but I think what is
*27:30.740- 27:36.100* :  interesting about it is how despite all of that money, all of that investment, all of that publicity,
*27:36.100- 27:41.140* :  it feels like we've been talking so much about this particular kind of AI, generative AI.
*27:41.140- 27:46.520* :  That's chatbots, tools that make text, that create video, that create music. Lots of people
*27:46.860- 27:51.480* :  have never even heard of them. 30% of the respondents in the UK hadn't heard of chat GPT,
*27:51.760- 27:57.040* :  which is absolutely the best known and most used chatbot, but they hadn't heard of its rivals either,
*27:57.040- 28:01.580* :  they hadn't heard of Google's Gemini, they hadn't heard of Anthropics Claude, or any of the other
*28:01.920- 28:05.480* :  tools that are out there on the market. And possibly there are two reasons for this. It tends to
*28:05.480- 28:11.780* :  skew towards younger people in terms of who's interested in it. So the study found that 56% of 18 to
*28:11.780- 28:19.540* :  24's and at least had a go at it, whereas only 16% of over 55's had tried out this tool. And it
*28:19.540- 28:23.720* :  does suggest, doesn't it, that in terms of embracing new tech, we're kind of where we've always been,
*28:23.720- 28:28.080* :  where younger people are more interested, and there's afraid maybe of having a go, but also
*28:28.080- 28:32.560* :  it's not always been easy. You know, it's only been around chat GPT for the last 18 months,
*28:32.600- 28:37.400* :  not all of these services are free. Some of them you have to sign up for and all of that is friction,
*28:37.440- 28:41.300* :  isn't it? It's a barrier to entry, if you like. Increasingly we are seeing business,
*28:41.300- 28:46.920* :  users being put for it. Certainly in terms of writing reports, in terms of summarising meetings,
*28:46.920- 28:52.800* :  Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, which is the creator of chat GPT,
*28:53.000- 28:57.620* :  and they now have a tool called co-pilot that's embedded in windows, which we know is used by
*28:57.620- 29:03.060* :  millions of people who do office work. And that can help you with all sorts of office administrative
*29:03.080- 29:08.360* :  type tasks. So we do know that that's the direction of travel, but actually this study suggests
*29:08.360- 29:13.580* :  that we're not there yet. Again, looking at the UK figures 25% of the respondents said that they
*29:13.580- 29:19.280* :  used some sort of chatbot for their personal lives, and only 20% had used them for their professional
*29:19.280- 29:23.200* :  lives. That's not to say that people aren't very worried though that the better these tools become,
*29:23.200- 29:29.060* :  the more of a threat they might become to people's jobs. Our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman.
*29:29.400- 29:34.320* :  It is nearly a year since the Titan submersible disappeared while travelling down to the wreck
*29:34.320- 29:39.900* :  of the Titanic on the Atlantic Sea floor. The craft imploded, killing all five people on board.
*29:40.460- 29:45.660* :  Now another billionaire is reportedly preparing to make the same journey in a submersible built by
*29:45.660- 29:50.940* :  a different company. According to the Wall Street Journal, Larry Conner, a billionaire from Ohio,
*29:50.940- 29:57.220* :  and Patrick Leahy, founder and CEO of Triton Submarines, are planning to explore the Titanic wreck
*29:57.220- 30:03.260* :  3,800 meters down. They're planning to use a submersible called the Triton 4,000,
*30:03.260- 30:09.120* :  which costs 20 million dollars, and is said to be made with the latest materials and technology.
*30:09.120- 30:15.240* :  So how different is this new submersible? Dr Simon Boxall lectures in oceanography at the University
*30:15.240- 30:20.560* :  of Southampton in southern England. If you look at the terrible disaster of the Titan submersible,
*30:21.080- 30:26.480* :  it was a poorly designed vessel that didn't really go through full stringent safety checks.
*30:27.320- 30:33.320* :  This new one, the Triton 4,000, is a more traditional vessel. It is safer. But then another question
*30:33.320- 30:38.100* :  is, why? You can't get out of a submersible. The pressure is too high. You're still restricted
*30:38.100- 30:44.860* :  to using cameras, using lights, using your eyes, admittedly, but also using manipulators if you
*30:44.860- 30:50.660* :  want to pick things up. And we do the same thing with an ROV. If something goes wrong with an ROV,
*30:51.020- 30:56.700* :  it's embarrassing you lose the equipment. If it goes wrong with a submersible, then you basically
*30:56.700- 31:00.620* :  have fatalities. And of course, the problem we've got is that this is all happening in international
*31:00.680- 31:07.180* :  waters. There are no rules that govern some of the stuff that goes on. There can be a lot of eyes
*31:07.180- 31:12.280* :  on this particular project. People are going to be asking questions of, have all the safety tests
*31:12.300- 31:17.380* :  been done. I suspect people going in, it will be far more cautious. But these are former tourism
*31:17.380- 31:21.600* :  at the end of the day. It's very expensive tourism. We've seen it in space. We're seeing it in the
*31:21.600- 31:26.620* :  depotion. I guess tourists have gone past the, I'm going to see the perimeter, I'm going to see
*31:26.620- 31:32.660* :  the wonders of the world. Then I'm looking at the thrills of the world. Oceanography expert Simon
*31:32.660- 31:38.940* :  Boxel. Well, talking of thrills, it does pose the question, what kind of extreme experiences are
*31:38.940- 31:45.380* :  people looking for? Leanna Bern asked Ricardo Araúlgel, who organizes trips for clients who don't
*31:45.380- 31:51.460* :  have to worry about the cost. At the moment, we are currently building a super your trip and in the
*31:51.460- 31:57.940* :  middle, we are diving to explore underwater city in Italy. So it's like about the Roman ruins
*31:57.940- 32:04.420* :  to see them up close. And then we are moving towards Egypt, where there are also ruins of the
*32:04.420- 32:11.500* :  Tirobaccio Palace. So those are not as deep as the Titanic, of course. That means you can also see
*32:11.500- 32:18.320* :  them. So we have like some sunlight. That's invisible. That's a very lavish request. Is that one of the
