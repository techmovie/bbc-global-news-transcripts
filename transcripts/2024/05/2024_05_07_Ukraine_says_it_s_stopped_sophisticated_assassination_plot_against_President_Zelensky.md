*01:08.940- 01:13.480* :  I'm Nick Miles, and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 7th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:14.000- 01:19.520* :  Vladimir Putin is sworn in as Russia's president for a fifth time, promising victory in
*01:19.520- 01:25.800* :  Ukraine as reports come in that a sophisticated plot to assassinate Vladimir Zelensky has
*01:25.800- 01:26.500* :  been thwarted.
*01:27.160- 01:32.520* :  Israel has stepped up its military operation in southern Gaza, and the latest on the
*01:32.520- 01:37.520* :  collapsed building in South Africa, where rescuers have made contact with survivors under
*01:37.520- 01:38.020* :  the rubble.
*01:40.460- 01:51.120* :  Also in this podcast, celebrations to mark one of the most enduring pieces of classical
*01:51.120- 01:54.300* :  music, two centuries after its first performance.
*01:57.800- 02:03.940* :  We start this podcast in Moscow, where President Putin's quarter of a century rule over Russia
*02:04.380- 02:07.140* :  has now been formally extended by another six years.
*02:08.540- 02:12.000* :  Vladimir Putin
*02:17.760- 02:23.880* :  This ceremony took place under the lavishly-gilded domes of the Kremlin's throne hall in front
*02:23.880- 02:25.220* :  of an invited audience.
*02:25.760- 02:31.120* :  Washington and the European Union are boycotting the Kremlin ceremony, although France and some
*02:31.120- 02:36.880* :  other EU states were expected to send an envoy, despite a plea not to do so by Ukraine.
*02:37.560- 02:42.680* :  Taking the oath, President Putin insisted he was open to dialogue with the West, but said
*02:42.680- 02:48.340* :  it had to be on equal terms, and he was unapologetic about Russia's full-scale invasion
*02:48.340- 02:48.880* :  of Ukraine.
*02:49.160- 02:56.980* :  It is great honor for me to address the homeland and particularly to the heroes of this special
*02:56.980- 03:00.720* :  military operation, those who are fighting for the homeland.
*03:01.500- 03:07.460* :  And I thank you very much for giving me your trust and confidence.
*03:09.460- 03:12.260* :  I am grateful to every citizen of Russia.
*03:13.040- 03:18.520* :  I am a Vitalyshevchenko, who is the Russian editor at BBC Monitoring, and who has seen
*03:18.520- 03:23.760* :  many of these inaugurations for his thoughts about what President Putin had said, particularly
*03:23.760- 03:26.060* :  mentioning the war in Ukraine right at the start.
*03:26.540- 03:29.500* :  I have to say that very little stood out for me.
*03:29.840- 03:32.960* :  He said exactly what I expected him to say.
*03:33.420- 03:40.920* :  One thing that's slightly different from the way he normally does his big speeches,
*03:41.660- 03:46.700* :  he acknowledged that Russia is going through a difficult period.
*03:46.700- 03:53.380* :  He said we'll move through it with dignity, so that's not something I would have expected
*03:53.380- 03:55.280* :  him to say ten years ago.
*03:56.000- 04:00.800* :  Ten years ago was more about good news, we're doing well, we're going to do even better.
*04:01.360- 04:08.160* :  Just on the route, he knows that Russians are watching how the so-called special military
*04:08.160- 04:09.900* :  operation is unfolding.
*04:09.900- 04:15.980* :  They know tens of thousands of Russians have been killed, and he has to respond.
*04:16.780- 04:20.820* :  And there was a sense that I got from it that he was trying to portray a Russia that
*04:20.820- 04:22.920* :  is under attack morally.
*04:23.560- 04:30.740* :  He talked about Russian values, how popular will that be amongst a certain percentage
*04:31.060- 04:32.040* :  of the Russian people?
*04:32.400- 04:38.200* :  Oh, it will be popular, and it's a point that percentage of the Russian people will
*04:38.200- 04:40.340* :  have heard and embraced before.
*04:40.340- 04:48.460* :  We are fighting for our very way of living, our traditional values as President Putin
*04:48.460- 04:55.880* :  called it, and it's a way of justifying his policies, and yes, the war against Ukraine.
*04:55.880- 05:02.260* :  If you turn on Russian TV, you will hear quite a lot about how the West is imposing its
*05:02.600- 05:07.720* :  decadent values on countries like Ukraine, and Russia knows Russia isn't going to be
*05:07.720- 05:08.200* :  very different.
*05:08.520- 05:13.780* :  He did say that we are open for dialogue with any Western nation, but then the caveat
*05:13.780- 05:15.440* :  was on our terms.
*05:16.020- 05:18.040* :  My question would be, does he mean it?
*05:18.040- 05:26.300* :  A lot of what happened and what was said in the Kremlin today isn't necessarily what
*05:26.300- 05:27.000* :  it seems.
*05:27.000- 05:35.900* :  So the Kremlin says, but so many people would hesitate to call what happened in Russia
*05:35.900- 05:42.500* :  earlier this year, an election after freedom of speech was all but obliterated, all the
*05:42.580- 05:49.560* :  key political opponents of Vladimir Putin are in exile in jail or dead.
*05:50.440- 05:55.080* :  If you challenge the party line, you're going to get fined, arrested, or worse.
*05:55.820- 05:58.220* :  So how free and fair is that election?
*05:58.660- 05:59.220* :  Not very.
*05:59.380- 06:07.180* :  And he was inaugurated with his right hand on the Russian constitution, and in his oath
*06:07.180- 06:12.520* :  he's war to respect and defend human rights and citizens' rights and freedoms and defend
*06:12.520- 06:13.140* :  the constitution.
*06:13.160- 06:20.580* :  But if it opened that red book on which his right hand rested, it says things like censorship
*06:20.580- 06:26.380* :  as banned, freedom of thoughts and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are all
*06:26.380- 06:30.980* :  guaranteed, and that's not exactly the kind of Russia we are seeing right now.
*06:31.500- 06:36.660* :  Vitaly Shepchenko, our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, was at the ceremony.
*06:37.160- 06:41.820* :  Because his assessment of how Vladimir Putin has changed in office and how he's viewed
*06:41.820- 06:44.280* :  after nearly a quarter of a century in power.
*06:48.900- 06:51.000* :  It was 24 years ago today.
*06:56.760- 07:04.300* :  Vladimir Putin walked down the red carpet through the grand Kremlin palace, on his way to taking
*07:04.300- 07:07.300* :  the presidential oath for the very first time.
*07:12.300- 07:17.880* :  That day he promised to preserve and develop democracy and take care of Russia.
*07:22.740- 07:30.520* :  As Vladimir Putin embarks on his fifth term as president, Russia is two years into a war
*07:30.520- 07:36.020* :  he's waging against Ukraine, a war in which Russia has suffered heavy losses.
*07:36.940- 07:43.720* :  While at home, instead of preserving democracy, Mr. Putin has been curtailing it, Jalen critics
*07:44.300- 07:47.880* :  removing all checks and balances on his power.
*07:48.240- 07:53.440* :  Now he's the king of Russia and he pretends to be the king of the whole world and he wants
*07:53.440- 07:57.660* :  this world to exist according to his terms, according to his rules.
*07:58.100- 08:03.140* :  Andrey Kolesnikov is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
*08:03.540- 08:10.540* :  This is closer to totalitarianism than to authoritarianism because Putin wants not simply
*08:10.540- 08:14.580* :  silence of the population he needs complicity.
*08:15.060- 08:19.420* :  On paper at least, this version of Putin is popular at home.
*08:19.880- 08:27.080* :  Officially, he won more than 87% in the March election, but he'd faced no serious challenger
*08:27.500- 08:30.980* :  in a vote widely seen as neither free nor fair.
*08:31.800- 08:38.700* :  So how do Russians view a leader who increasingly styles himself as a modern day Russians are?
*08:42.240- 08:46.880* :  To find out, I drive to the town of Kashira, 70 miles from Moscow.
*08:47.720- 08:54.680* :  Here, a gigantic Putin portrait, a massive mural takes up one whole side of an apartment
*08:54.680- 08:54.980* :  block.
*08:56.020- 08:59.680* :  And Kashira, big Vladimir, is watching you.
*09:03.820- 09:08.740* :  I like him, says pensioner Valentina, who's selling flowers by the roadside.
*09:09.340- 09:12.200* :  Putin has good ideas and does a lot for people.
*09:13.020- 09:17.780* :  True, our pensions aren't big, but he can't fix everything in one go.
*09:18.620- 09:23.220* :  But when I ask the next passerby, Alexander, what he thinks of the president?
*09:25.340- 09:29.760* :  It's dangerous now to express an opinion, he says, no comment.
*09:30.920- 09:36.460* :  Most of the people I talk to here say they walk past the Putin mural without even noticing
*09:36.500- 09:37.040* :  it now.
*09:37.680- 09:43.300* :  They've got used to it, just like they've grown used to one man, running Russia.
*09:45.580- 09:47.400* :  Steve Rosenberg reporting there.
*09:48.160- 09:53.780* :  In the midst of the bitter war between Russia and Ukraine, assassination attempts on the leaders
*09:54.300- 09:55.700* :  have always been a possibility.
*09:55.700- 10:00.580* :  And now it seems a plot to kill President Zelensky has been thwarted.
*10:01.020- 10:04.180* :  For more on this, I spoke to our Ukraine correspondent, James Waters.
*10:04.700- 10:09.100* :  Plots on President Zelensky's life, these assassination plans are common.
*10:09.660- 10:13.680* :  Ever since the full-scale invasion, when Russian power troopers tried to descend on the
*10:13.680- 10:15.320* :  presidential palace to take him out.
*10:15.320- 10:18.760* :  But this is a plot, which really does stand out.
*10:18.760- 10:26.240* :  We have the country's intelligence service arresting two serving kernels in the Ukrainian
*10:26.240- 10:31.160* :  security service, which is responsible for keeping institutions and officials safe.
*10:31.740- 10:37.360* :  Now, it is alleged that these men were hired by Moscow before the full-scale invasion
*10:37.360- 10:43.640* :  as moles in a meeting in neighboring European countries where large sums of cash were transferred.
*10:44.260- 10:49.580* :  And their role, their planned role, was to leak details of President Zelensky and other
*10:49.580- 10:55.460* :  senior officials' routes, travel routes, security details, as well as the addresses where they
*10:55.460- 11:01.080* :  stayed, with the aim of them being struck by a Russian missile.
*11:01.080- 11:02.780* :  But the detail keeps coming.
*11:03.140- 11:08.620* :  They're also, it's also alleged that they took large amounts of weapons from the Ukrainian
*11:08.620- 11:11.840* :  regions they were serving in, too, key, to carry out this attack.
*11:12.120- 11:15.760* :  They included mines, explosives, as well as drones.
*11:16.020- 11:17.840* :  So it really is a plot, which has it all.
*11:17.840- 11:23.280* :  But it really is a reminder of the risks that President Zelensky, a war leader, faces.
*11:23.560- 11:23.840* :  Indeed.
*11:23.980- 11:27.720* :  I mean, you say these are allegations, obviously, at the moment, but they're serving
*11:27.900- 11:28.640* :  kernels.
*11:29.000- 11:33.880* :  Now, if the allegations are proven, it's deeply worrying for the authorities there, isn't
*11:33.880- 11:33.940* :  it?
*11:34.420- 11:38.120* :  Particularly, perhaps, given that perhaps money may have played a part in it.
*11:38.840- 11:39.720* :  You would think so.
*11:40.020- 11:45.080* :  And what we won't find out, I don't think, is how close these men got.
*11:45.940- 11:50.520* :  But the tone that the intelligence service is trying to strike is that we've watched
*11:50.560- 11:54.980* :  them all along, and we didn't let it get too far down the line.
*11:54.980- 12:00.540* :  But of course, this is something that Ukraine will be all to wary of.
*12:00.760- 12:05.140* :  This is a country with a history of corruption, which it is grappling with.
*12:05.360- 12:09.380* :  And there have been reforms in some areas, but it's a start reminder of what President
*12:09.380- 12:10.200* :  Zelensky faces.
*12:10.440- 12:11.200* :  James Waterhouse.
*12:12.400- 12:18.780* :  Despite months of talks about a possible cease-fire in Gaza, a deal still seems as elusive
*12:18.960- 12:19.380* :  as ever.
*12:20.020- 12:25.060* :  On Monday, Hamas agreed to a deal, but Israel now says the terms don't meet its needs.
*12:25.460- 12:28.020* :  The exact details of the plan remain unclear.
*12:28.520- 12:32.900* :  Meanwhile, overnight, an inter-tuse day, Israel carried out its most intense bombardment
*12:32.900- 12:34.300* :  of the city of Raffa.
*12:34.940- 12:40.200* :  The UN says it's access to Gaza's Raffa crossing is being denied now by the Israeli authorities.
*12:40.700- 12:46.020* :  Louis Wateridge is a spokesperson for Unwa, that's the United Nations Relief and Works
*12:46.020- 12:47.480* :  Agency in Gaza.
*12:47.820- 12:52.160* :  The last 24 hours have been a complete roller coaster of emotion.
*12:52.520- 12:56.460* :  Even the last few days, there was so much hope for a cease-fire.
*12:56.960- 13:02.200* :  Anybody you speak to hear the last week, the last few months, every day, all they want
*13:02.200- 13:04.160* :  to know is when there is a cease-fire coming.
*13:04.680- 13:06.840* :  And it's what everybody has been hoping for.
*13:07.220- 13:12.600* :  So to wake up yesterday morning to the devastating news, the leaflets had been dropped and an
*13:12.600- 13:13.980* :  evacuation order was in place.
*13:14.660- 13:16.920* :  It really spread a lot of fear across the community.
*13:16.980- 13:21.560* :  I'm currently in Western Raffa, but across Eastern Raffa, people started to move.
*13:21.940- 13:26.380* :  But even outside my window, I was able to see people starting to take down their makeshift
*13:26.420- 13:29.420* :  shelters, start to pack up and start to leave Raffa.
*13:29.580- 13:31.240* :  So there's a lot of fear spreading.
*13:31.860- 13:36.820* :  As the day has gone on, I've seen, again, more and more vehicles move out of the Raffa
*13:36.820- 13:39.420* :  area as people are packing up their things and leaving.
*13:39.420- 13:44.200* :  Clearly, people are hearing the situation at the Raffa border crossing and now deciding
*13:44.200- 13:46.120* :  to leave once again.
*13:46.560- 13:51.740* :  The Raffa crossing is the biggest and the only entry that Unwa, the largest humanitarian
*13:51.740- 13:53.880* :  agency here in Gaza has been using.
*13:54.520- 13:56.920* :  And now there is no aid able to get in.
*13:56.920- 13:59.020* :  And in addition to that, there is also no fuel.
*13:59.500- 14:04.820* :  So fuel is really what the agencies need to run this massive humanitarian operation across
*14:04.820- 14:05.680* :  the Gaza Strip.
*14:06.000- 14:09.880* :  Fuel is what's needed to run the trucks to get the aid to the people who need it.
*14:10.180- 14:14.680* :  Fuel is needed in the generators to run the hospitals and health clinics that are remaining
*14:14.680- 14:16.100* :  and not damaged and destroyed.
*14:16.620- 14:21.260* :  So without this fuel and without these aid supplies, the aid operation here is simply going
*14:21.260- 14:22.060* :  to ground to a halt.
*14:22.720- 14:26.480* :  I got the latest on the Israeli military action from our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*14:26.480- 14:27.100* :  Yolanda.
*14:27.460- 14:31.040* :  Israeli military said in a briefing to journalists this morning it had taken control
*14:31.040- 14:36.940* :  of the Palestinian side of the only crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the Raffa crossing.
*14:37.020- 14:41.740* :  And we've seen footage already of tanks rolling into that crossing.
*14:42.220- 14:44.480* :  There are certainly many air strikes overnight.
*14:44.480- 14:47.380* :  You could see the smoke rising up on the horizon still this morning.
*14:47.680- 14:51.380* :  People told us that there were flares lighting up the sky constantly overnight.
*14:51.500- 14:56.580* :  Israel says it's killed 20 Hamas terrorists in his operation in Raffa.
*14:56.580- 15:02.880* :  His found three tunnel shafts, Palestinians saying that many innocent civilians have been killed.
*15:02.880- 15:05.780* :  There was a man talking about how he'd lost his wife and children.
*15:06.440- 15:11.320* :  As far as the Israeli military is concerned, this is a very precise and limited raid of Raffa.
*15:11.320- 15:12.740* :  That's what they've been saying to journalists.
*15:12.740- 15:18.200* :  It's not the full-scale ground offensive that, of course, the US and others have warned Israel
*15:18.200- 15:22.800* :  against because of the humanitarian consequences, because of the high numbers of displaced people
*15:22.800- 15:24.120* :  that are living in that city.
*15:24.260- 15:29.200* :  It may well not be the full-scale assault that many people are expecting,
*15:29.200- 15:31.760* :  but as we heard from that humanitarian spokesperson,
*15:32.480- 15:37.180* :  it's causing problems with little aid or fuel getting in at the moment.
*15:38.020- 15:41.880* :  Yeah, this has really closed the Raffa crossing for a start,
*15:41.880- 15:45.120* :  so that people will not be able to cross in and out.
*15:45.120- 15:49.660* :  And that is a crossing that has been important for aid organisations as well as those Palestinians
*15:50.280- 15:51.440* :  who've been able to move.
*15:51.820- 15:58.180* :  And at the moment, we also have the Karem Shalom crossing closed after rockets were fired by Hamas.
*15:58.620- 16:02.000* :  The Israeli military says from inside Raffa on Sunday,
*16:02.000- 16:05.240* :  killing four Israeli soldiers close to the Karem Shalom crossing.
*16:05.240- 16:07.280* :  That is the main commercial crossing for aid.
*16:07.280- 16:12.140* :  So this, although the Israelis say that they're going to look at how to open the Karem Shalom
*16:12.140- 16:16.900* :  crossing as soon as security allows, this is an extremely worrying time for humanitarian
*16:16.900- 16:19.820* :  organisations and of course for Palestinians in that area,
*16:20.220- 16:24.380* :  because it's now become extremely difficult to get supplies in to Raffa,
*16:24.380- 16:28.120* :  which is where you have about half of the population right down there
*16:28.160- 16:29.820* :  in the south of the Gaza Strip.
*16:30.500- 16:33.200* :  Meanwhile, you land that the diplomacy goes on.
*16:33.220- 16:34.880* :  We are rather in the dark, aren't we?
*16:34.900- 16:38.280* :  Hamas accepted this ceasefire agreement.
*16:38.280- 16:40.060* :  We don't know exactly what was in it.
*16:40.060- 16:45.360* :  It's been rejected by Israel, and yet Israel is now sending another delegation for the talks.
*16:45.800- 16:50.340* :  That's right, and it's a moment where prospects for a ceasefire deal really do look to be hanging
*16:50.340- 16:54.740* :  in the balance. You've got the cataries also sending their negotiators back to Egypt
*16:54.740- 16:57.380* :  because they've been involved in the mediation effort as well.
*16:57.760- 16:59.040* :  And it's a confusing picture.
*16:59.040- 17:01.000* :  I mean, the devil is in the detail of this deal,
*17:01.000- 17:06.240* :  and we don't get to see, you know, in full exactly what Hamas has agreed to.
*17:06.280- 17:10.080* :  There was one unnamed Israeli official who was briefing journalists
*17:10.640- 17:13.160* :  that this was a watered-down Egyptian proposal,
*17:13.160- 17:14.900* :  something that Israel couldn't accept.
*17:14.900- 17:17.260* :  There were parts in it that it rejected outright.
*17:17.260- 17:21.520* :  But other officials being quoted saying that this was not very different from the Israeli deal
*17:21.920- 17:26.060* :  laid out at the end of last month, which the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said
*17:26.480- 17:27.920* :  was extraordinarily generous.
*17:28.340- 17:28.960* :  Yuland Nell.
*17:30.500- 17:36.340* :  May the 7th marks the 200th anniversary of the premiere of a work that is widely regarded
*17:36.760- 17:39.780* :  as one of the great masterpieces of Western classical music.
*17:40.360- 17:42.080* :  Beethoven's 9th Symphony.
*17:42.080- 17:45.040* :  It was first performed in 1824 in Vienna,
*17:45.520- 17:48.160* :  where the German composer lived and worked for most of his life.
*17:48.560- 17:52.380* :  The anniversary has been marked by several performances of the symphony by the Vienna
*17:52.380- 17:55.380* :  Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Ricardo Mutti.
*17:56.020- 17:58.180* :  Bethany Bell reports from the Austrian capital.
*18:05.960- 18:09.540* :  It's a work that touches me on so many different levels.
*18:09.740- 18:11.680* :  It's an outcry for peace.
*18:11.680- 18:13.460* :  It's an outcry for unification.
*18:13.640- 18:15.200* :  It's an outcry for brotherhood.
*18:19.440- 18:24.480* :  Daniel Froschauer is first violinist and chairman of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
*18:25.000- 18:27.360* :  It's so many things at the same time.
*18:27.580- 18:30.760* :  You know, obviously it's also the European anthem that's of,
*18:31.240- 18:35.240* :  it's a piece that just touches my heart every time I play it.
*18:35.540- 18:36.580* :  It never leaves you cold.
*18:37.220- 18:41.700* :  The beginning, for example, when you don't know, you know you're in D minor or major,
*18:41.700- 18:42.800* :  it's not declared.
*18:42.800- 18:45.580* :  It's just immediately takes you in a different cosmos.
*18:53.860- 18:58.140* :  Beethoven himself helped conduct the first performance of this symphony,
*18:58.840- 19:00.780* :  despite his increasing loss of hearing.
*19:01.700- 19:04.940* :  In the orchestra, were musicians who would later go on to become
*19:04.940- 19:07.380* :  founding members of the Vienna Philharmonic.
*19:08.220- 19:12.520* :  The musicologist Otto Bieber says the symphony was revolutionary.
*19:14.120- 19:19.340* :  It was a symphony, but with something new in the fourth movement,
*19:19.840- 19:22.900* :  there was a choir on the stage, and the choir starts to sing,
*19:22.900- 19:26.380* :  and there was solace on the stage, and it was starting to sing.
*19:27.300- 19:32.280* :  There were so many new details, very difficult for the musicians,
*19:33.520- 19:40.880* :  and very experimental, and he had the idea I have to open the door to the future,
*19:42.140- 19:47.420* :  as a work left by Beethoven for the next generation.
*19:58.740- 19:59.400* :  You're lifted up.
*19:59.780- 20:03.120* :  At the end, when you're singing, you're just lifted up, and it's wonderful.
*20:12.700- 20:17.980* :  Everything is like exploding in joy, exploding in light, and happiness,
*20:17.980- 20:24.560* :  and being friendly to each other, so that not one bit of the starkness is any longer here,
*20:24.560- 20:27.420* :  and I think Beethoven had a lot of darkness in his life.
*20:28.140- 20:32.140* :  And I think with this ninth symphony, he overcame it.
*20:48.000- 20:49.220* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*20:49.580- 20:55.080* :  It was so electric and so charming, and I just had the best night of my life, I guess.
*20:55.640- 20:58.860* :  How major music artists are turning their attention to India.
*21:06.900- 21:07.620* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*21:07.620- 21:12.340* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*21:12.340- 21:14.720* :  prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*21:15.140- 21:17.700* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*21:17.700- 21:21.480* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*21:21.480- 21:23.080* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*21:23.360- 21:28.680* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*22:13.720- 22:17.340* :  An Australian woman who's accused of murdering her in-law
*22:17.420- 22:22.980* :  by serving poisonous mushrooms in a beef Wellington has pleaded not guilty.
*22:23.520- 22:29.480* :  Erin Patterson from Melbourne is charged with three counts of murder and five of attempted murder.
*22:29.760- 22:32.080* :  Or Australia correspondent Katie Watson reports.
*22:32.560- 22:35.580* :  Erin Patterson has always maintained her innocence, but this was the first time
*22:35.580- 22:39.960* :  that her legal team said she would be pleading not guilty to all charges against her.
*22:39.960- 22:44.160* :  Now, the charges relate to a lunch that she put on at her home in Leon Gaffer,
*22:44.480- 22:47.380* :  which is a town a few hours drive from here in Melbourne.
*22:47.820- 22:51.820* :  At that lunch, she served a beef Wellington with mushrooms and attending that lunch
*22:52.200- 22:57.400* :  were her in-laws as well as her mother-in-law's sister and her husband too.
*22:57.860- 23:02.380* :  Now, after that lunch, all of the guests fell ill and three of them subsequently died.
*23:02.380- 23:06.980* :  The fourth guest in Wilkinson, he was in a coma before recovering,
*23:06.980- 23:11.860* :  but the police said that it was alleged that she fed them a death cap mushrooms.
*23:12.720- 23:16.640* :  Now, also invited to that lunch was her former husband Simon Patterson.
*23:16.640- 23:17.820* :  He did not attend.
*23:17.860- 23:23.040* :  Now, the charges against her are three counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder,
*23:23.040- 23:28.540* :  and they also include previous alleged attempts against Simon Patterson's life.
*23:28.980- 23:33.880* :  Now, also decided at the hearing was that the case would be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court.
*23:33.880- 23:36.880* :  That means that a trial will come sooner rather than later.
*23:36.880- 23:40.860* :  And the next hearing is expected in this court here in a few weeks time.
*23:41.460- 23:48.480* :  Katie Watson, emergency services in South Africa have made contact with 11 construction workers
*23:48.480- 23:52.820* :  trapped in the ruins of a collapsed apartment building in the coastal city of George.
*23:52.820- 23:56.480* :  At least five people are confirmed dead and dozens are missing
*23:57.200- 24:01.900* :  after the five-story building, which was still being built, fell to the ground on Monday.
*24:02.600- 24:08.140* :  Colleen Diner, the chief director for disaster management for the Western Cape region, gave this
*24:08.140- 24:14.760* :  update. Did we contact with 11 people? We have one area where four people are in a basement,
*24:14.760- 24:18.080* :  and we've been communicating with them, so that's quite a big operation.
*24:18.140- 24:19.880* :  We'll take them most of the day to get them out.
*24:20.620- 24:24.440* :  Well, for more, I spoke to Xinganyaka, who's been to the building site in George,
*24:25.020- 24:27.880* :  and a warning that the signal of her phone is rather patchy.
*24:28.160- 24:32.720* :  There are two specific areas that the registry was looking at.
*24:32.720- 24:38.300* :  And I saw that firsthand. A lot of the focus right now is on the basement area.
*24:38.300- 24:41.620* :  So there's a lot of excavation that's happening there.
*24:42.180- 24:46.420* :  And earlier on, you know, there's a lot of noise, there excavators,
*24:46.880- 24:53.920* :  and as well as cranes that are pulling concrete as well as scaffolding from these ruins.
*24:53.920- 24:58.160* :  And at one point, one of the team leaders put his hand up and said,
*24:59.180- 25:04.440* :  and then there was silence, and they pulled somebody out, and that person was taken to the hospital,
*25:04.440- 25:08.500* :  and they said it in several ambulances that aren't there with stretchers waiting.
*25:08.540- 25:15.020* :  And so I think there's hope that they will be found alive, and that they will be rescued today
*25:15.020- 25:19.420* :  before the day ends, before it descends into this chilly winter night.
*25:19.420- 25:23.680* :  But some others that were pulled from the rubblehead, unfortunately, died.
*25:23.740- 25:32.240* :  But this is a really a small fraction of the number of people that are still buried underneath this five-story ruins.
*25:32.240- 25:37.120* :  75 people were on site. We understand most of them construction workers,
*25:37.680- 25:40.360* :  and the majority of them are still underneath the rubble.
*25:40.920- 25:46.960* :  Shiganyaka, researchers tried to name all those people killed in the Holocaust,
*25:46.960- 25:52.100* :  in the Second World War, have made a series of breakthroughs using AI technology.
*25:52.100- 25:56.400* :  The findings were revealed as part of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day.
*25:56.900- 25:58.980* :  The newsroom's Jessica Wilkins has its report.
*26:00.580- 26:04.300* :  Artificial intelligence may help identify more victims of the Holocaust.
*26:05.020- 26:08.700* :  Researchers in Israel are using AI to comb through piles of records.
*26:09.740- 26:12.320* :  Names have been found by reading through statements and documents,
*26:13.020- 26:15.660* :  checking film footage, cemeteries, and other records.
*26:16.620- 26:19.460* :  They hope to find details of people who were killed by the Nazis,
*26:19.500- 26:22.280* :  but whose names were missing from official records.
*26:22.760- 26:26.620* :  Esterfuck's Bruma is from the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Centre.
*26:26.840- 26:32.380* :  We were able to collect 4.9 million names,
*26:33.020- 26:35.180* :  and we're trying to reach a 6 million.
*26:35.600- 26:40.360* :  The Centre has already begun using AI to find vital information about those who went missing.
*26:40.780- 26:44.080* :  Names go into the Centre's database of those killed in the Holocaust,
*26:44.740- 26:46.440* :  and is then matched with existing data.
*26:48.340- 26:50.080* :  That technology works very fast.
*26:50.140- 26:55.420* :  It takes a few hours to go over hundreds of testimonies,
*26:55.620- 26:59.360* :  and it's very exact the results.
*26:59.360- 27:04.540* :  A human being wasn't able to do it when human beings used to go over.
*27:04.540- 27:07.140* :  We had volunteers that went over those testimonies.
*27:07.140- 27:08.880* :  They missed out a lot of information.
*27:09.580- 27:11.440* :  So far, AI has been effective.
*27:12.160- 27:14.760* :  Out of the names found, 90% have been new.
*27:15.900- 27:20.180* :  One such name is Ruth, a 4-year-old girl bound for Auschwitz with her twin sister.
*27:20.180- 27:21.500* :  AI Guilayde.
*27:21.920- 27:24.700* :  It would be survived with killed, murdered,
*27:25.360- 27:30.360* :  and we were able to bring more information about Ruth from someone that's not her family at all.
*27:30.820- 27:33.160* :  Someone that met her in the camp,
*27:34.060- 27:41.640* :  and we believe that way we'll be able to be a lot of stories about a lot of victims that were killed.
*27:42.320- 27:46.360* :  A little kid that no one else knew to tell us a story about what happened to them.
*27:46.780- 27:48.480* :  That report was by Jessica Wilkins.
*27:49.620- 27:54.640* :  It's often noted that when major international artists plan their world tours,
*27:55.460- 27:56.720* :  India has been left out.
*27:57.440- 27:58.500* :  That's now starting to change.
*27:58.500- 28:04.440* :  More musicians like Ed Sheeran are heading there to try to break into the multi-million dollar market.
*28:05.080- 28:06.360* :  Megan Lawton has this report.
*28:06.780- 28:13.080* :  Last month, 50,000 people headed to the Mahalakshmi race course in Mumbai.
*28:13.080- 28:15.220* :  They were there to see Ed Sheeran.
*28:18.080- 28:22.540* :  He sang in Punjabi for the first time with Indian singer Diljit Dostanj.
*28:22.540- 28:28.600* :  The video went viral with more than 50 million views.
*28:29.260- 28:31.580* :  Sachin was there and enjoyed every minute.
*28:31.920- 28:33.480* :  It was so electric and so charming.
*28:34.100- 28:37.380* :  And I just had the best night of my life, I guess.
*28:38.180- 28:41.320* :  And Ed Sheeran isn't the only one to play on that stage.
*28:44.780- 28:46.040* :  Over the last 12 months,
*28:46.040- 28:47.920* :  the Jonas Brothers, Royal Blood,
*28:47.980- 28:51.260* :  and even West Life have all energised India's music scene.
*28:51.260- 28:57.860* :  About 13.5 million Indians are stepping out for events on an annualised basis outside of movies.
*28:58.340- 29:01.240* :  Ashish Hemrajani is the co-founder of Book My Show,
*29:01.240- 29:04.680* :  India's most popular online ticketing platform for live events.
*29:04.780- 29:08.780* :  They put on shows, as well as sell tickets across sport,
*29:08.780- 29:11.020* :  theatre, live music and cinema.
*29:14.180- 29:15.320* :  Over the past 10 years,
*29:15.320- 29:20.560* :  India's entertainment landscape has rapidly changed from one that's focused on movies to music.
*29:21.240- 29:26.340* :  Since 2022, live music has been Book My Show's fastest growing category,
*29:26.380- 29:29.320* :  contributing to 25% of their revenue.
*29:29.700- 29:31.600* :  Ashish says the weather can be a challenge.
*29:31.600- 29:33.720* :  It's a country where six months of the year,
*29:33.720- 29:35.440* :  it's either too hot or it's raining,
*29:35.880- 29:36.920* :  and you'd rather be indoors.
*29:37.520- 29:40.580* :  And there aren't any indoor venues for live entertainment.
*29:41.180- 29:43.020* :  But that's something they're trying to change.
*29:43.580- 29:45.000* :  One of the things that we're doing is taking
*29:45.420- 29:48.200* :  earlier created infrastructure for sports or cricket
*29:48.660- 29:51.300* :  and seeing if we can use it as a multi-use venue.
*29:52.180- 29:55.480* :  As well as building new stages and developing better transport routes,
