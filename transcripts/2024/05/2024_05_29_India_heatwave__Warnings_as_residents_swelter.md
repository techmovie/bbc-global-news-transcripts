*01:19.100- 01:22.820* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.980- 01:30.060* :  And Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 29th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:30.060- 01:36.500* :  Threats of water shortages as India's capital Delhi breaks the all-time heat record and the country
*01:36.500- 01:42.400* :  swelters. A senior Israeli official says he expects the fighting to continue in Gaza for at least
*01:42.400- 01:48.120* :  the rest of the year. Han North Korea is menacing its southern neighbour with balloons filled with
*01:48.120- 01:53.900* :  rubbish. As voters in South Africa go to the polls, President Siral Ramaphosa believes support for
*01:53.900- 02:01.640* :  his party is solid. Also in this podcast, this is somewhere in blackmail. I'm going to post it all
*02:01.640- 02:08.180* :  over the internet. The Nigerian criminals using nude photos to extort money from young people
*02:08.180- 02:17.800* :  around the world. In India, there are warnings of water shortages after officials there
*02:17.800- 02:24.280* :  recorded the highest ever temperature for the capital Delhi at 52.3 degrees Celsius,
*02:24.280- 02:31.020* :  shattering the record set just 24 hours earlier. India is of course no stranger to searing summer
*02:31.020- 02:36.660* :  temperatures, but climate change is making heat waves longer, more frequent, and more intense.
*02:37.360- 02:42.260* :  The heat wave was also smashing records across other parts of the country with the extreme heat
*02:42.260- 02:47.800* :  taking its toll on everyone, including relatively fit young students who were rushed to hospital
*02:47.800- 02:53.740* :  after collapsing at a school in Bihar. This doctor said the extreme heat wave was making them ill.
*02:55.780- 02:59.980* :  The students are facing difficulties because of the extreme heat and rising temperatures.
*03:00.540- 03:06.060* :  There's an electrolyte imbalance in their bodies which is making them feel faint or vomit or feel
*03:06.060- 03:11.800* :  dizzy. To understand what it's like to live in such conditions,
*03:11.800- 03:15.440* :  I've been speaking to our correspondent in Delhi, Raghvendra Rao.
*03:15.960- 03:21.780* :  It's getting very, very unbearable for the people of Delhi and for the people of North and
*03:21.780- 03:28.680* :  Central India in general. This is the kind of heat which has not been witnessed in India before,
*03:28.700- 03:35.140* :  and many people are already feeling very apprehensive as to what they are in store for.
*03:35.520- 03:40.360* :  Well, you're there. You're in Delhi. Tell us what it's like trying to cope with this kind of heat.
*03:40.860- 03:47.460* :  Well, it's very difficult to operate in such high temperatures. I mean,
*03:47.460- 03:53.020* :  people are finding it extremely difficult to carry out their day-to-day lives. In fact,
*03:53.020- 03:59.840* :  many schools in this part of the country and in the north of India, they have discontinued
*03:59.840- 04:04.900* :  classes. In fact, they have moved to online teaching for a few days because you cannot expect
*04:04.900- 04:11.140* :  children to be going out to schools in such harsh weather. In fact, many private companies
*04:11.140- 04:17.120* :  are also said to be mulling options of allowing their employees the option of working from home.
*04:17.580- 04:23.140* :  It's getting very, very difficult for people just to step out of their homes and do their
*04:23.260- 04:29.980* :  normal jobs or attend to their normal responsibilities. So, yes, I mean, very horrible conditions there,
*04:29.980- 04:35.120* :  and it's something which people are finding it very, very difficult to deal with.
*04:35.300- 04:38.840* :  I mean, is it difficult to breathe in that kind of heat? Are you hit by a wall of heat?
*04:39.460- 04:44.980* :  Well, absolutely. And, you know, we have already witnessed in cases of people getting heat strokes.
*04:45.600- 04:49.260* :  The authorities are issuing advisories. They are asking people not to venture out
*04:49.260- 04:57.620* :  in these hot climates, and they are, in fact, advising people to take as much liquids as they can.
*04:57.620- 05:03.120* :  And all kinds of advisories are being issued. People are, in fact, being encouraged, not to venture
*05:03.120- 05:09.580* :  out at all. Ragvendra Rao in Delhi. Well, several parts of Asia have been grappling with unusually
*05:09.580- 05:14.260* :  high temperatures this year. A trend scientist say has been worsened by climate change.
*05:14.780- 05:17.080* :  4 3 2
*05:24.160- 05:29.440* :  Now a joint European-Japanese satellite that will measure how clouds' effect climate
*05:29.440- 05:35.560* :  has successfully made it into orbit. The EarthCare satellite blasted off on Elon Musk's
*05:35.560- 05:41.520* :  SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from the Van den Berg Space Force Base in California. Computer
*05:41.520- 05:46.980* :  modeling suggests that cloud cover could actually decrease in the future, amplifying global warming
*05:46.980- 05:51.960* :  by allowing the Earth to absorb more energy from the Sun. Our science correspondent Jonathan
*05:51.960- 05:57.100* :  Amos was watching Lift Off and spoke to Alex Ritson. Yeah, it's a fascinating mission, Alex.
*05:57.100- 06:03.100* :  It's going after one of the great uncertainties in climate prediction. You know, our computer
*06:03.100- 06:08.680* :  models are really good at trying to tell us about what will happen into the future if we
*06:09.280- 06:14.020* :  continue to put greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But there are a few things that we're
*06:14.120- 06:21.000* :  really quite uncertain about. And one of those is the behavior of clouds. The role clouds will have
*06:21.840- 06:27.580* :  in influencing the climate as we go forward. If you look at clouds, some of the low-level clouds
*06:27.580- 06:33.000* :  as big fluffy clouds down near the surface of the Earth, they help cool the planet. The Sun's
*06:33.000- 06:38.160* :  radiation comes in. It bounces off the top of them and it goes back out into space. But some of
*06:38.160- 06:45.120* :  the high-level clouds, these high-series clouds, they act as a blanket, they trap heat and they help
*06:45.120- 06:52.020* :  warm the climate. And so the key for the computer models for climate scientists is to work out where
*06:52.020- 06:57.880* :  the balance is and how that might change as more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere.
*06:58.220- 07:02.140* :  And Earth care is the tool that they're going to use to try and work that out.
*07:02.840- 07:08.600* :  Yeah and though this was launched by an Elon Musk SpaceX rocket, this is actually led by the
*07:08.600- 07:13.720* :  European Space Agency. Yeah there's a long story there. I mean it was supposed to go up on a Russian
*07:13.720- 07:19.500* :  rocket and then they had the Ukraine war and so Europe stopped using Russian rockets. They were
*07:19.500- 07:25.000* :  going to use a European rocket but then that had a failure. And so they rang up Mr.
*07:25.000- 07:31.460* :  Musk and said actually can you help us and he's given them one of his rockets while obviously he
*07:31.560- 07:37.400* :  sold it to them to put this Earth care mission into space. It's been a long time coming.
*07:38.000- 07:44.280* :  The first concept was was dreamt up 30 years ago, 31 years ago can you believe that?
*07:44.600- 07:50.360* :  The mission was approved 20 years ago and only now is it in orbit because they've had
*07:50.360- 07:56.580* :  enormous technical challenges developing the instruments that will get this information for them.
*07:56.580- 08:02.140* :  So it's got a space laser that fires down through the atmosphere. That's going to look at the
*08:02.140- 08:08.660* :  tops of the clouds. It'll see all the very fine dust particles and what we call aerosols droplets
*08:08.660- 08:15.860* :  in the atmosphere around which clouds, water vapor and condense and make clouds.
*08:16.780- 08:22.360* :  But it'll also look with a radar inside the clouds so they'll know how much water is in those
*08:22.360- 08:29.600* :  clouds, the updrafts and the down drafts. They'll get a really good idea of how clouds form
*08:29.740- 08:36.320* :  and evolve through time. Jonathan Amos. A senior Israeli official says he expects
*08:36.320- 08:41.580* :  fighting to continue in Gaza for at least the rest of this year. The Prime Minister's National
*08:41.580- 08:47.360* :  Security Adviser Zaki Hanigbi also says Israel's military now controls three quarters of the
*08:47.360- 08:52.600* :  buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border. From Jerusalem, I'm at least correspondent Yalan Nell
*08:52.600- 08:57.760* :  reports. The idea that the Gaza war could go on for at least another seven months will worry
*08:57.760- 09:03.880* :  many in Israel and outside. There's been growing international pressure on Israeli leaders to outline
*09:03.880- 09:09.300* :  a full strategy to end the fighting and a convincing post-war vision for the Palestinian territory.
*09:09.340- 09:14.620* :  In his interview, Mr Hanigbi seen as a close confident of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*09:14.900- 09:20.140* :  also suggested that Israel would soon take full control of the strategically important strip
*09:20.140- 09:25.520* :  along the Gaza-Egypt border. The plan he added was to work with the Egyptians to prevent
*09:25.520- 09:31.520* :  weapon smuggling to Palestinian armed groups. In Raffach, in southern Gaza, residents say that
*09:31.520- 09:36.240* :  today there have been more Israeli air strikes and that Israeli tanks mounted raids in the
*09:36.240- 09:42.700* :  western center before retreating to positions on the border. Yalan Nell. In Mexico, the presidential
*09:42.700- 09:47.660* :  elections are due to be held on Sunday and one of the main concerns raised during the campaign
*09:47.660- 09:53.360* :  is the situation at the border with the U.S. Every day, thousands of Mexicans illegally
*09:53.360- 09:59.220* :  cross the border into America, often in extremely treacherous conditions. The BBC's James Reynolds
*09:59.220- 10:04.060* :  has been to the Californian desert to hear about the tragic fate of one of the migrants.
*10:06.960- 10:11.760* :  This is the border area between Mexico and the United States and if you look on a map, you'll see
*10:11.780- 10:16.940* :  that the border between the two countries extends for what about, about 2,000 miles, 3,000 kilometers
*10:16.940- 10:25.280* :  and there are cities along the American side. But it is only when you get here, when you stand
*10:25.380- 10:35.420* :  right here in the desert under the sun, almost all alone, that you realise just how dangerous it is
*10:36.220- 10:42.700* :  to be trying to make this crossing. It is easy to get lost here, to run out of water,
*10:43.380- 10:49.260* :  simply not to know which way to turn confused by the shrub land, not knowing which way is Mexico
*10:49.920- 10:56.500* :  and which way is the United States. And the dangers of this journey are shown by what happened here
*10:57.080- 11:01.840* :  to one man. He was trying to build a life for him and his wife and his four kids.
*11:03.020- 11:10.320* :  He broke his leg on the journey and he died not far from me here in the shade of a small bridge.
*11:11.560- 11:18.960* :  This border has become an election campaign point on both sides, both for Mexico and also
*11:18.960- 11:25.080* :  for the United States. It will be debated and discussed as those two elections approach the first
*11:25.120- 11:33.300* :  in June and the second in November. On this trip, in addition to my BBC colleagues, we've also
*11:33.300- 11:39.240* :  been joined by a volunteer who works in this border area. My name is Cesar Diosa,
*11:40.240- 11:44.820* :  we usually come out to the desert twice a month searching for people that have passed
*11:45.320- 11:51.060* :  or they are alive but they are trying to find their way home. Usually families of family members
*11:51.060- 11:58.600* :  they call us or send a message on our Facebook page and asking for help. So once we gather
*11:58.600- 12:05.180* :  in our information, we go to the area where they told us their family member might be missing.
*12:09.120- 12:13.980* :  Where are we going now? Yeah, right now we're heading down to that bridge right there.
*12:14.680- 12:21.140* :  It's right off the all highway 8. That's where we found Jose,
*12:21.960- 12:30.000* :  Sarvantes about two years ago. We found them about 30 minutes after he had passed.
*12:30.160- 12:35.580* :  What did he die of? We are going to share about it probably dehydration. He had a broken leg
*12:36.460- 12:41.980* :  and so he was able to walk all this along from the border and he finally passed
*12:42.580- 12:47.080* :  right here exactly right here and we're just underneath a very small bridge we have to dock our heads
*12:47.780- 12:53.760* :  and going underneath and there's a little shine to him here. There we are Jose Federico Hernandez
*12:54.440- 13:01.120* :  and they were able to bury him in Mexico. No, they buried him here so he's buried in the
*13:01.120- 13:07.040* :  United States. You can see this border on the map and the first thing that you do when you look
*13:07.040- 13:11.680* :  on the map is you see the US on one side, Mexico on the other side you see that the border between
*13:11.680- 13:18.240* :  the two stretches for about 2,000 miles, 3,000 kilometers. She's the big city, San Diego, El Paso and
*13:18.240- 13:24.060* :  so on but the map doesn't tell you everything. It's only when you're standing right here in the desert
*13:24.060- 13:32.260* :  that you realize just how vast this border area is and just how small human beings are in this area.
*13:32.840- 13:39.720* :  I hear nothing around me. I see desert around me, I see shrubs and bushes and mountains and the
*13:39.720- 13:48.120* :  distance you can feel lost, you can feel entirely on your own here in the desert. I want to get you
*13:48.200- 13:55.060* :  to listen to the sound of the deserts and you're probably not going to hear anything and that
*13:55.720- 14:02.600* :  is the entire point. Let's listen. I wonder if you heard anything apart from perhaps a slight
*14:02.600- 14:07.940* :  rustle of the wind. We've heard a few insects buzzing by, we haven't heard any bird song, we haven't
*14:07.940- 14:16.480* :  heard any traffic, we haven't seen any people walking by. In this desert you can be entirely alone
*14:17.760- 14:23.880* :  and the sounds tell you that you are alone. James Reynolds. BC News has learned that international
*14:23.880- 14:29.140* :  criminals are selling guides on social media explaining how to carry out the crime of sextortion.
*14:29.320- 14:34.460* :  The guides show how to pose as a young woman online trick victims into sending sexually
*14:34.460- 14:40.260* :  explicit material and then blackmail them. Last month the UK National Crime Agency issued an
*14:40.260- 14:46.200* :  alert to schools about a rise in cases involving children, a correspondent Angus Crawford reports.
*14:48.620- 14:57.400* :  On the beach drinking cognac, living it up. Olamide Shanu accused of making two million pounds
*14:57.400- 15:04.580* :  through sextortion. Part of a gang tricking victims into sending nude images of themselves online
*15:04.580- 15:13.580* :  and then blackmailing them. Yesterday in court in London, facing extradition to the US.
*15:14.320- 15:19.980* :  Investigators say Olamide Shanu was involved in the sextortion of hundreds of victims,
*15:19.980- 15:26.440* :  part of a new wave of gangs based mainly in Nigeria. Their aim, terrify their targets,
*15:26.440- 15:33.660* :  often children and make them pay. He was shell short and he was literally physically shaking.
*15:34.480- 15:40.300* :  There are scores of different gangs targeting children. Children like Lucy's 14-year-old son.
*15:40.940- 15:45.800* :  Then he just came up to me and said, Mummy, I've had this message and he just looked terrified, worried
*15:46.620- 15:52.260* :  and I said, what is it? He showed me his phone. It was a text message basically saying,
*15:52.800- 15:57.700* :  don't shut us down. If you don't send us money in 24 hours, we'll send a picture to all your contacts.
*15:58.800- 16:03.340* :  Lucy closed her son's account, turned off the phone and never heard from the gang again.
*16:03.340- 16:09.160* :  Her son's fine. She's furious. We know that some teenagers tragically
*16:09.160- 16:13.720* :  have ended their own lives because of this. If he hadn't been at home that morning and I hadn't
*16:13.720- 16:18.080* :  been in the kitchen and he hadn't talked to me, I don't know how he would have carried on the
*16:18.080- 16:27.960* :  rest of that day. I don't know how it would have played out for him. A film made to warn young people
*16:27.960- 16:35.480* :  in the US where cases have surged. Experts warn boys a most at risk. Nigerian criminals calling
*16:35.480- 16:43.420* :  themselves Yahoo boys. It's become a global industry. DIY guides, sex torsion manuals openly for sale
*16:43.420- 16:50.700* :  online. Every Friday, usually payment. He boasts that his victims have to pay him again and again.
*16:50.860- 16:55.100* :  This is some way blackmail. This one takes pride in threatening people.
*16:55.300- 17:00.020* :  I'm going to post it all over the internet. We decide to call one, see if he'll pick up,
*17:00.420- 17:09.060* :  challenge him. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? I'm a journalist from the BBC.
*17:10.460- 17:15.720* :  You're a criminal and you're exploiting children. You're extorting them and blackmailing them.
*17:15.720- 17:21.520* :  What have you got to say for yourself? I'm really sorry about that and I can actually assure
*17:23.660- 17:29.880* :  it does. That one's continuing. Well, he says he won't continue, but I don't believe a word of
*17:29.880- 17:34.760* :  that. He's completely untraceable and there are hundreds, maybe thousands of men just like him
*17:35.060- 17:41.960* :  carrying out sex torsion. Lucy is speaking up about her child now to protect other peoples.
*17:42.900- 17:48.300* :  If every teenager in England knew this was a possibility, hopefully very few would become prey.
*17:49.720- 17:55.140* :  That report from Angus Crawford. Still to come in this podcast.
*17:58.820- 18:05.060* :  Basically, I remix nursery rhymes and I turn them into modern sounding mainstage club anthems.
*18:06.200- 18:09.080* :  High nursery songs have been given a modern makeover.

*19:21.660- 19:25.920* :  Voting is underway in South Africa and what could be the most consequential election
*19:25.920- 19:31.920* :  since the historic vote back in 1994, which saw the end of the racist apartheid era
*19:31.920- 19:37.940* :  and the nation's move to democracy. Nearly 28 million voters have the chance to cast their ballot.
*19:38.580- 19:44.520* :  Anger over corruption scandals, soaring crime, unemployment, frequent power cuts and water shortages
*19:45.160- 19:49.560* :  suggest the African National Congress, the party of the country's first democratically
*19:49.560- 19:55.440* :  elected president Nelson Mandela, may lose its majority for the first time in 30 years.
*19:55.880- 19:58.740* :  These voters in Soweto were clear about the issues that matter.
*19:59.560- 20:04.760* :  Education, unemployment is high in the country, crime is high in the country,
*20:05.580- 20:11.580* :  and even if people cannot be employed after they're educated, they're able to go and
*20:11.580- 20:17.980* :  work in other countries. When you have to switch on the generator, the cost of diesel has been
*20:17.980- 20:22.940* :  going up, the cost of doing businesses gone up. Sometimes I think that change is good,
*20:23.320- 20:29.360* :  because to be honest, I don't see ANC doing anything, personally for me, but I don't know about
*20:29.360- 20:35.560* :  other people. Nomsomaseko watched former president Jacob Zuma cast his vote outside Durban.
*20:36.300- 20:42.500* :  There was lots of commotion and singing and unilating when his security came inside
*20:42.500- 20:49.180* :  of this polling station, hundreds of his supporters have also gathered here and they've been singing
*20:49.180- 20:56.320* :  and chanting his clan name. So Jacob Zuma has voted, but he is quite an important figure in
*20:56.360- 21:01.260* :  this election, because his political party could be kingmaker in this election,
*21:01.260- 21:04.740* :  particularly in this province of Guadalupe, Natal.
*21:05.260- 21:09.980* :  I spoke to our Africa correspondent Barbara Pletasha, who was at a polling station in Soweto.
*21:10.760- 21:15.380* :  I've just arrived at a voting station at a school in the township of Soweto,
*21:15.380- 21:20.800* :  Quantacana, Junior Secondary School, and I'm shivering in the early morning cold,
*21:21.360- 21:25.200* :  watching clusters of people warm themselves around small fires.
*21:25.820- 21:32.600* :  I don't see the sun, do you? I know the sun is coming, so I'm a bit at ease knowing that you know,
*21:32.940- 21:37.800* :  it's almost symbolic because this is the anxious, shaky time, we're going to vote,
*21:37.800- 21:40.520* :  we're going to do all of this stuff, but you know the sun is coming.
*21:40.780- 21:45.600* :  Well, that sounds very hopeful, and as a young man, what are your biggest concerns?
*21:45.600- 21:50.840* :  You know what happens when people get into power and corruption, but we can always think about
*21:50.840- 21:56.620* :  those things as deterrence, but hope is the thing that led us to me being able to vote right now.
*21:57.260- 22:01.280* :  This voting station is in the old neighborhood of Nelson Mandela. His house is really just a five
*22:01.280- 22:06.820* :  minute walk away, and as party, the A and C, people still feel they owe it a bit of gratitude because
*22:06.820- 22:10.860* :  it gave them the right to vote at the dawn of democracy in South Africa, and so for that reason,
*22:10.860- 22:17.500* :  many people are still supporting it, but also the party is losing support because of people's
*22:17.500- 22:22.160* :  unhappiness with its performance and government. What's on your mind now is you're planning to
*22:22.160- 22:27.780* :  cast your vote. We are excited that there's more opportunities for new parties, which have come on
*22:27.780- 22:32.860* :  board. You don't want just one party ruling. That you voted for the A and C in the past? I have,
*22:32.860- 22:38.040* :  sounds like you might be giving another party an opportunity this time, but really? No.
*22:40.660- 22:44.260* :  Voting got off to a bit of a late start at this polling station, but people have now begun
*22:44.260- 22:50.620* :  to cast their ballots. I know my custom, my vote, would make a change, and I hope that God
*22:50.620- 22:56.320* :  should help us. What kind of change are you looking for? There is a lot. Most of our children have
*22:56.320- 23:02.500* :  gone into drugs. They can't get to jobs. They can't go to school. Man is not there. There's a
*23:02.500- 23:08.840* :  lot. Hi, what's your name? My name is Togoto. And you are how old? I'm 18. So this is your first
*23:08.840- 23:13.060* :  election. And how do you feel about that? Just helping. We need to vote out some people.
*23:13.060- 23:18.660* :  And which party do you think can bring change? The Islamic EFF. EFF meaning the economic freedom
*23:18.660- 23:23.700* :  fighters, yes? So you think the A and C is doing a good enough job? It has done nothing for the past
*23:23.760- 23:29.800* :  days. The economic freedom fighters are a breakaway party from the A and C with quite radical
*23:29.800- 23:37.100* :  solutions to South Africa's economic situation. They propose nationalizing minds and expropriating
*23:37.100- 23:43.840* :  land. The other breakaway party is the MK, which is backed by the former president, Jacob Zuma,
*23:43.840- 23:49.560* :  and is seen as his challenge to the current president, Cyril Ramaposa. Do you think there is
*23:49.560- 23:56.060* :  an option on the ballot that can bring the change you want? I'm going to any minimo, it's to be honest.
*23:56.060- 24:00.520* :  But you obviously feel strongly enough about the right to vote to cast you about it.
*24:00.660- 24:05.900* :  Definitely. I do feel strongly about it. I don't know what I'm voting for, but we'll see
*24:05.900- 24:10.900* :  inside. Voting is going to continue here and throughout the country until the end of the day.
*24:10.900- 24:15.460* :  And then the focus is going to shift to the outcome. In particular, how much support the A and C
*24:15.460- 24:20.320* :  got, how much it lost, and how it will handle that. But whatever the case, this election marks
*24:20.320- 24:24.760* :  a new era for the A and C and for South Africa. Barbara Pletasha.
*24:25.680- 24:29.960* :  The former Prime Minister of Thailand, Tax and Chinawatt, has been accused of insulting the monarchy,
*24:29.960- 24:36.720* :  a serious charge under Thai-led majesty laws. His comment stayed back to 2015 when he was in exile.
*24:37.180- 24:42.520* :  He's now back in Thailand and due to appear in court in three weeks' time. So why is this happening
*24:42.520- 24:47.980* :  now? Here's our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. Well, it has to be political. I mean,
*24:47.980- 24:53.060* :  this is Tax and Chinawatt, a very high profile controversial figure, still mistrusted by much
*24:53.060- 24:59.320* :  of Thailand's sort of conservative establishment. It's going to be widely seen as a kind of warning,
*24:59.320- 25:04.320* :  a sword that hangs over him. The case is likely to take quite a long time to come to trial. They're
*25:04.320- 25:08.600* :  very slow in Thailand. And just a kind of warning not to get too ambitious. You know, when he came
*25:08.600- 25:14.160* :  back last year under this grand bargain where he was pardoned, he technically was supposed to serve
*25:14.500- 25:19.100* :  a jail sentence, but didn't spend a bit of time in hospital. The idea, well, he said, was that he
*25:19.100- 25:22.520* :  wasn't going to be involved in politics and that he wanted to spend time with his grandchildren.
*25:23.220- 25:28.040* :  Everybody knows he's the main funder and very influential in his party, which is at the core
*25:28.040- 25:33.560* :  of the governing coalition. His ally, Senator Tavisin is the Prime Minister, and he's become a bit
*25:33.560- 25:38.340* :  more visible. He's been moving around looking almost like a man who's campaigning. And I think there
*25:38.340- 25:43.080* :  are people who just want to put that warning there. And it really is a draconian law, isn't it? I mean,
*25:43.080- 25:49.680* :  what could happen to him if fun guilty? Every lesbianity charge has the potential for you to get
*25:49.680- 25:56.620* :  a three to 15 year prison sentence. Typically, these are reduced by half. If you don't contest the
*25:56.620- 26:01.480* :  charges, you immediately confess, which is what happens in most cases. But some people are charged
*26:01.480- 26:06.800* :  on multiple counts. You know, people post something on Facebook. If the posts go out seven times,
*26:06.820- 26:11.040* :  you can end up getting seven times that. So the record sentence we've seen so far is something
*26:11.040- 26:15.840* :  like 50 years in prison. Remember the comments, Mr. Taksen's alleged to have made didn't relate to
*26:15.840- 26:21.240* :  the monarchy. They're related to the advisory council of senior military figures that advises the
*26:21.240- 26:26.240* :  King. He accused them of being complicit in the coup that ousted the administration of his sister
*26:26.240- 26:31.200* :  back in 2014. He didn't actually comment on the royal family of the monarchy itself, but it's still
*26:31.200- 26:36.200* :  at the courts would view covered by the law. And what do you think this tells us about the
*26:36.200- 26:41.500* :  situation in Thailand at present? But it's still very fluid. You know, people imagined last year where
*26:41.500- 26:47.480* :  Mr. Taksen was allowed to come back that there was this grand bargain that the conflict that has hung
*26:47.480- 26:52.880* :  over Thailand for the last 15, 20 years, where he was at the heart of it and was feared for his
*26:52.880- 26:58.000* :  populist style by the old conservatives close to the palace, that that was being settled, that he
*26:58.000- 27:03.080* :  was no longer such a threat, that he was older, that his party had been outflanked by this new
*27:03.080- 27:09.060* :  reformist party move forward, and that that would allow a stable coalition with his party at the
*27:09.060- 27:15.760* :  core of it. Jonathan Head. North Korea has made good on its threat to send balloons across the
*27:15.760- 27:21.800* :  border to South Korea in retaliation for propaganda leaflets sent into the north. South Korea's
*27:21.800- 27:27.040* :  military says it's found dozens of balloons in two border provinces with plastic bags attached
*27:27.040- 27:32.280* :  containing waste paper and even excrement. Asia-Pacific editor Silia Hatten gave
*27:32.280- 27:38.540* :  you the latest on the balloon wars. As you said just a few days ago, North Korea warned that it
*27:38.540- 27:45.100* :  was going to do this. The vice minister of national defense warned that there would be retaliation
*27:45.100- 27:51.120* :  in return for. As you said, balloons that had been sent over from the North, the South Korea inside
*27:51.120- 27:56.560* :  over into the north. These are balloons that have been sent for years and years now despite a
*27:56.560- 28:02.840* :  ban on the practice placed in 2020. South Koreans and North Korean defectors have been sending
*28:02.840- 28:11.740* :  balloons, carrying pamphlets, leaflets, often religious leaflets, carrying USB sticks, medicine
*28:11.740- 28:18.040* :  radios, all sorts of things. The North Koreans finally got a bit fed up with this, or I shouldn't
*28:18.040- 28:22.280* :  say finally, they have been very upset about this for years, but on Sunday, they warned they were
*28:22.280- 28:28.180* :  going to send balloons of their own, and that's exactly what they've done. We're now into hundreds
*28:28.180- 28:33.680* :  of balloons that have been sent over from North Korea into the South. They've been found across
*28:33.680- 28:42.920* :  eight of South Korea's nine provinces, carrying plastic scraps of paper, dirt, and yes, animal excrement.
*28:42.940- 28:47.780* :  So there have been lots of warnings from the South Korean military for people to stay inside and
*28:47.780- 28:51.820* :  definitely stay away from the contents of these balloons. Well, it does sound like a bit of a
*28:51.820- 28:57.060* :  dirty protest. What is the current state of relations between the two Koreas? They're just at a
*28:57.100- 29:05.300* :  really low point, I would say. You know, we have seen these kinds of stunts before between the two.
*29:05.740- 29:12.840* :  Back in 2020, North Korea actually blew up a liaison office that was used by the two countries
*29:12.840- 29:18.560* :  that was on the North Korean side of the border, just to illustrate its displeasure with the South.
*29:18.560- 29:25.580* :  Since then, we've gone on to see North Korea test a record amount of missiles. We've seen North
*29:25.580- 29:31.220* :  Korea suspend a military pact between the two that was attempting to keep peace. That happened
*29:31.220- 29:37.720* :  just last year, and then also end its goal of eventually reuniting with the South. And I
*29:37.720- 29:42.780* :  should add that both sides, South Korea has really developed its relationships with Japan and the
*29:42.780- 29:48.040* :  United States. And North Korea has really cosied up to Russia. In fact, the United States says that
*29:48.040- 29:53.660* :  there's an unprecedented amount of military cooperation in between North Korea and Russia. So
*29:53.660- 29:59.340* :  basically, they're finding their own friends. A North Korea's state news agency says it will send more
*29:59.340- 30:05.320* :  balloons across the border. And finally, should traditional nursery rhymes, such as blah, blah,
*30:05.320- 30:10.120* :  black sheep and Humpty Dumpty, get a rebrand. Well, the children's charity Youth Music
*30:10.120- 30:16.180* :  questioned 500 parents and found half thought under fives would benefit from a wider choice of
*30:16.180- 30:21.820* :  sounds. Even the world's biggest act for toddlers, the Wiggles, has decided its time to shake it up
*30:22.200- 30:28.140* :  with the release this week of a rave album. David Celitor reports on a movement to bring techno to
*30:32.280- 30:41.060* :  toddlers. The wheels on the bus are toddler classic, but now a new version.
*30:44.140- 30:51.400* :  Welcome to techno for toddlers. Basically, I remix nursery rhymes and I turn them into modern sounding
*30:51.400- 30:59.460* :  main stage club anthems. Lenny Pierce is just one of a number of artists trying to widen the
*30:59.500- 31:05.220* :  preschool musical diet. My daughter is one and a half years old and that was my daughter's favorite
*31:05.220- 31:10.900* :  song at the time, but just the normal one, the wheels on the bus. So I just changed it up a little
*31:10.900- 31:15.960* :  bit and it's got about almost two million streams in just three weeks. She's really, really crazy.
*31:16.340- 31:20.420* :  And I've just launched a series of like rave shows for kids and he's not alone.
*31:24.760- 31:31.660* :  This is Oli Halvison, who writes bespoke songs for the under fives and their preferred musical style.
*31:33.620- 31:39.080* :  Iana Leia, for instance, her very tastes. Michael Jackson, Angela Jackson.
*31:46.580- 31:51.840* :  And Etta and Ernie? Johnny Cass. Johnny Cass. Yeah, you do listen to that, ain't it?
*31:51.840- 31:59.580* :  Twinkle, twinkle, little star. For anyone who thinks it's all twinkle, twinkle at this age,
*31:59.580- 32:04.840* :  research by the youth music charity has revealed a different picture as their program director,
*32:04.840- 32:10.520* :  Carol Reed explains. Under fives are often just underestimated and kind of written off and
*32:10.520- 32:14.460* :  actually what we've seen here is that they're like the rest of us. Is the traditional music serving
*32:14.460- 32:19.060* :  families well? The traditional music of under fives is not chiming with the modern generation.
*32:19.800- 32:24.040* :  Half of the families that we spoke to said that they thought nursery rhyme lyrics needed to be
*32:30.440- 32:35.700* :  updated. Yes, nursery rhymes. Attends to reform and rewrite them date back to the Victorian era.
*32:35.860- 32:43.040* :  It's a part of the easy temporary period. With our much success, three-year-old Jordan is partial,
*32:43.820- 32:51.020* :  to a bit of goosey goosey. It's easy, it's easy, that's the answer. I'm not still about it,
*32:51.020- 32:57.780* :  because I love you. Um, not so keen on a rhyme that's almost definitely not about geese,
*32:57.880- 33:05.100* :  but rather possibly priestholes or prostitution. And the rest of the parents here have their doubts.
*33:05.900- 33:11.320* :  Jordan's right, Anthony, I'll see you around tomorrow. You've had it with blah, blah,
*33:11.320- 33:14.320* :  blah, actually, haven't you? Yes. You're at least favourites.
*33:21.600- 33:26.700* :  And for Angelina and Oliott, groundswell who have to sing all this stuff, you've got a world
*33:26.700- 33:33.620* :  weary look. There's hope that the pre-school repertoire might be ripe for change. I just think
*33:33.620- 33:39.120* :  finding a range of songs, finding a range of songs from different types of genres, different
*33:39.120- 33:45.160* :  languages. The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round. I actually like that one
*33:45.160- 33:51.080* :  probably even less. So maybe Lenny and his techno for toddlers is onto something.
*33:52.980- 33:57.440* :  Indeed, he's already had an influence on his brother's band, who happened to be
*33:57.880- 34:00.520* :  global superstars of music for the under-fives.
*34:06.860- 34:11.980* :  The Wiggles, who have just released their first pre-school brave album.
*34:16.420- 34:17.300* :  That's a note to end on.
*34:19.560- 34:23.320* :  And that's it for us for now, but we'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
