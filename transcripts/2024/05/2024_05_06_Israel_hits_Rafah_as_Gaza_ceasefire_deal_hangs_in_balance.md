*01:29.040- 01:33.300* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday the 7th of May.
*01:33.300- 01:39.000* :  Hamas says it accepts the latest Gaza ceasefire deal prompting celebrations in the Palestinian
*01:39.000- 01:44.680* :  territory. Israel, though, says it can't agree to the proposal but is willing to negotiate.
*01:44.700- 01:50.220* :  Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians are evacuating part of Rafa as Israel carries out what it calls
*01:50.220- 01:58.300* :  targeted strikes. Also in the podcast, Russia announces drills involving tactical nuclear weapons
*01:58.300- 02:03.980* :  near Ukraine. The authorities in South Africa search for survivors trapped in a collapsed building.
*02:04.460- 02:10.140* :  And it's a really big day for Boeing. They've been working on Starliner for 10 years at least.
*02:10.180- 02:13.840* :  This is the big one. This is the first test flight with humans on board.
*02:14.460- 02:19.720* :  All eyes are on Cape Canaveral in Florida where Boeing is trying to send astronauts into space.
*02:24.660- 02:29.960* :  After on-off negotiations over the weekend events in Gaza have moved quickly over the past 24
*02:29.960- 02:36.680* :  hours. First, Israel told around 100,000 Palestinians to leave Eastern Rafa ahead of a planned
*02:36.680- 02:40.880* :  offensive on the city. Then the Israeli military began carrying out air strikes,
*02:40.880- 02:45.880* :  hitting what it said were more than 50 terror targets. And while all that was going on,
*02:45.880- 02:51.120* :  Hamas announced it had accepted the latest Egyptian and Qatari proposals for a ceasefire
*02:51.120- 02:55.360* :  and hostage deal. That news prompted an outpouring of joy in Rafa.
*03:01.880- 03:06.540* :  The BBC's Gaza Correspondent Rushdie Abu Aluf has been monitoring events from Istanbul.
*03:07.080- 03:13.400* :  I think Hamas quick response today was part of the Israeli land to launch big
*03:13.400- 03:19.020* :  ground operation in Rafa, which already started this morning. Well, there is no movement to
*03:19.020- 03:24.400* :  tank yet within Rafa itself. Yeah, there is some tanks in the border, very heavy artillery,
*03:24.400- 03:29.500* :  shell in the eastern part and heavy air strike in the area. We have seen throughout the day,
*03:29.500- 03:34.200* :  people are leaving to the western part of the city. And what Hamas said in the end,
*03:34.640- 03:38.920* :  now the border is in the hand of the Israelis to decide whether they accept the deal.
*03:39.560- 03:45.980* :  Our Gaza Correspondent Rushdie Abu Aluf, Israel initially said the draft deal included far
*03:45.980- 03:51.120* :  reaching changes it could not accept. But a few hours later, the Israeli Prime Minister
*03:51.120- 03:56.240* :  Benjamin Netanyahu said that while he didn't like the proposal, he would send negotiators to
*03:56.240- 04:01.780* :  try to reach an agreement. At the same time, he said Israel would continue its attacks in Rafa.
*04:01.780- 04:04.600* :  The Israeli Army spokesman is Daniel Hagari.
*04:07.700- 04:14.380* :  Throughout the day, Air Force Aircrafts targeted more than 50 terror targets in the Rafa area.
*04:15.060- 04:20.960* :  This evening as well, we call on those who are in specific areas, which we have designated and
*04:20.960- 04:27.640* :  defined in all ways, including radio, media, internet and flyers and eastern Rafa,
*04:28.120- 04:33.880* :  to move towards the expanded humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi and Khan Unis.
*04:34.540- 04:37.280* :  There they will get full humanitarian assistance.
*04:39.640- 04:44.580* :  Israeli Army spokesman Daniel Hagari. Israeli protesters took to the streets outside,
*04:44.580- 04:50.880* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, demanding that he accept a deal to get the hostages out.
*04:52.420- 04:58.980* :  I think that our government is not willing to cease fire and that's why I'm so worried.
*04:59.140- 05:05.000* :  We should say yes, let's sit and talk and do anything we can do to bring the hostages home
*05:05.280- 05:07.080* :  because our government to accept this.
*05:07.420- 05:15.760* :  Crazy government wants to enter Rafa. It wants to continue the war instead and it will not
*05:15.760- 05:22.320* :  bring any peace. It will kill more Palestinians, civilians of course. It will kill our soldiers
*05:22.760- 05:24.860* :  and it will kill our hostages.
*05:25.940- 05:30.380* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, I spoke to our security correspondent, Frank Gardner,
*05:30.380- 05:34.520* :  in Jerusalem, and I asked him if he'd been able to find out what is in the proposed deal.
*05:34.880- 05:41.760* :  We've got a rough idea. Yes, it's a two-phase deal that would it consist of the first phase
*05:41.760- 05:47.780* :  as the 42-day truce, a period of no fighting, during which there would be an exchange of prisoners.
*05:48.620- 05:55.820* :  33 hostages left out of Gaza, primarily women, the elderly and the sick, in return for a much,
*05:55.820- 06:02.220* :  much larger number of Palestinian prisoners to be let out of Israeli jails. A large number of
*06:02.220- 06:07.880* :  Palestinian displaced people who are currently sheltering in the south would be allowed to return
*06:07.880- 06:15.680* :  to their homes in the north of Gaza and there would be a phased dismantling of Israel's military
*06:15.680- 06:21.720* :  operation in central Gaza and a gradual withdrawal of its forces. This will be followed by a similar
*06:21.720- 06:29.680* :  period of hopefully calm, leading to a, quote, a sustained period of calm. So this is the kind of
*06:29.680- 06:37.360* :  minimized way of trying to get around Hamas' insistence on an end to the fighting. The reason
*06:37.360- 06:42.700* :  mother talks collapsed in Cairo the weekend was that Hamas insisted that they wouldn't sign up
*06:42.700- 06:48.820* :  to anything that didn't promise a total end to Israel's assault on Gaza and the Israeli
*06:48.820- 06:53.160* :  government said, no way are we going to agree to that. Now we still don't know exactly what Israel
*06:53.160- 06:59.400* :  is going to agree to. I think they've been frankly a bit blindsided by this. They began the day,
*06:59.400- 07:04.340* :  as we know, with dropping leaflets on the residents of eastern Ruffa in southern Gaza strip,
*07:04.820- 07:09.720* :  telling them to evacuate because a limited military operation was underway or about to start
*07:10.540- 07:17.440* :  and that has started. So what we've had in the last few hours is an announcement that there has
*07:17.440- 07:23.260* :  been a unanimous war cabinet decision here in Israel to continue to prosecute their military
*07:23.260- 07:29.460* :  operation in Ruffa, but at the same time they will be sending a delegation and negotiators
*07:30.600- 07:35.640* :  to Cairo to try and thrash out a deal with Hamas. They've said that the terms of the deal at the
*07:35.640- 07:42.280* :  present are far from what Israel's needs, but they are prepared to go the extra mile to try and
*07:42.660- 07:47.360* :  thrash it out. So I think we're in a more optimistic place than we were 24 hours ago.
*07:47.820- 07:52.100* :  Yeah, and the fact that they have agreed to send negotiators is significant at the weekend,
*07:52.100- 07:57.740* :  they wouldn't do that. Does this suggest that Benjamin Netanyahu is coming under pressure from
*07:57.740- 08:02.600* :  the U.S. and others? He's under pressure from all sides, so he's got the American say,
*08:02.600- 08:08.880* :  do the deal. Don't do a military operation in Ruffa, do the deal instead, and he has kind of
*08:08.880- 08:13.360* :  gone against their wishes by launching this military operation in Ruffa, although I'm sure there
*08:13.360- 08:18.480* :  will be some elements of the military security establishment here in Israel who will be congratulating
*08:18.480- 08:23.700* :  themselves by saying, look, we started to put military pressure on them in Ruffa and look what
*08:23.700- 08:28.720* :  happens. They agree to a deal. We need to continue with the operation. There are, of course,
*08:28.720- 08:32.760* :  the hostage families who've been out protesting tonight, as they had been most nights,
*08:33.260- 08:40.760* :  particularly in Tel Aviv, demanding in Hebrew exile a sharp deal now. They want Israel to do a deal
*08:40.760- 08:44.860* :  and to stop revaricating and get on with it to get their hostages out.
*08:45.260- 08:50.320* :  Frank Gardner in Jerusalem. Well, the prospect of an Israeli invasion of Ruffa has prompted warnings
*08:50.320- 08:56.340* :  from a number of countries. The UN said a safe evacuation from the city would be impossible
*08:56.340- 09:01.960* :  after Israel told Palestinians to move to two tentative cities. One of those instructed to leave
*09:01.960- 09:09.540* :  Ruffa is 21-year-old student Mahmoud Rostan. So, more than two weeks, the IDF are posting on
*09:10.280- 09:16.500* :  the Arabic channels and social media that they will enter Ruffa soon. So, we did that because
*09:16.500- 09:23.700* :  we are afraid of near-operation here in Ruffa. We are suffering here and we need to do that
*09:23.760- 09:29.580* :  every day. It's unknown in the future. We don't know when the world will stop.
*09:30.400- 09:35.300* :  Well, Scott Anderson is the Gaza director for the main UN agency for the Palestinians. He told
*09:35.300- 09:40.300* :  us about the situation in Ruffa and what Palestinians could expect if they had to move to the
*09:40.300- 09:45.540* :  tent city of Al-Mawasi. They're very crowded already. There's almost half a million people that
*09:45.540- 09:51.580* :  had previously been displaced and had decided to literally set up camp in Al-Mawasi. So,
*09:51.580- 09:55.460* :  it's a very difficult place to find additional space for people to set up their tents.
*09:56.120- 10:01.980* :  Over 6,000 people so far have left Ruffa headed toward communists or the middle area. I think
*10:01.980- 10:06.400* :  people are quite nervous that they won't find somewhere good to set up their tent or that if
*10:06.400- 10:10.600* :  they wait, they won't be able to take their tent with them and they just want to find somewhere
*10:10.600- 10:15.280* :  that they can set up and try to find the basic necessities for their families every day.
*10:15.680- 10:19.900* :  I certainly don't see evidence of supplies coming from anybody other than the international
*10:19.900- 10:25.940* :  humanitarian community. There's still 1.4 million people in Ruffa and we expect up to a million
*10:25.940- 10:32.080* :  people to possibly be displaced from Ruffa. Scott Anderson of UNRA. Well, the US is anxious that
*10:32.080- 10:36.960* :  Israel doesn't carry out its planned major military operation on the city as our North
*10:36.960- 10:41.480* :  America correspondent Gary O'Donney who told us. The administration here believing we're at a
*10:41.480- 10:48.360* :  really critical stage in this whole process. They are saying that they're looking at the details
*10:48.360- 10:55.440* :  of the deal that Hamas have said they'll accept, talking to their partners in the region and also
*10:55.440- 11:01.560* :  of course the CII director Bill Burns is shuttling between Qatar and Cairo trying to work out
*11:01.900- 11:06.680* :  what to do next. Now they're saying that they're going to look at that in great detail.
*11:07.240- 11:12.040* :  One thing they've been very clear on is the question of Ruffa. They say they've seen no credible
*11:12.040- 11:18.500* :  plan of how to protect humanitarian needs in Ruffa if there were any kind of incursion there.
*11:18.920- 11:24.040* :  They've been opposed to that all along and I think one thing today from the National Security
*11:24.040- 11:29.460* :  Council spokesman John Kirby sums it out. He said, I don't think there has been a more
*11:29.460- 11:35.400* :  sensitive stage than right now. Gary O'Donney who are North America corresponded.
*11:36.220- 11:41.320* :  Other news now and a major operation involving police, sniffer dogs and emergency services is
*11:41.320- 11:46.760* :  underway to try to find dozens of people trapped under the rubble of a collapsed multi-story building
*11:46.760- 11:52.560* :  in the South African city of George. Two people are confirmed dead. One more than 20 survivors with
*11:52.560- 11:57.480* :  varying injuries have been taken to nearby hospitals from Johannesburg, Hishin Ganyokha.
*11:57.840- 12:02.440* :  The dead were among the first group of injured construction workers fed to the hospital after
*12:02.440- 12:08.380* :  the building collapsed. A George city spokeswoman confirmed that 75 crew members were on site
*12:08.380- 12:14.000* :  when the five-story apartment structure crashed on Monday afternoon. CCTV footage showed the
*12:14.000- 12:19.020* :  moment that the building collapsed in a cloud of dust. A major operation is underway to find
*12:19.020- 12:24.320* :  those still trapped. The volunteer group Gift of the Givers which is providing on-site assistance
*12:24.320- 12:29.700* :  told the AFP that rescuers had established communication with some of those still under
*12:29.700- 12:36.560* :  the rubble. The French president Emmanuel Macron has thanked his Chinese counterparts
*12:36.560- 12:42.640* :  Xi Jinping for a fresh commitment not to sell arms to Russia. Presidency who is in Paris
*12:42.640- 12:47.720* :  on his first state visit to Europe in five years also came under pressure over trade.
*12:47.720- 12:51.500* :  The president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said there were
*12:51.500- 12:57.280* :  imbalances between China and the EU that were a matter of great concern. Our correspondent
*12:57.280- 13:05.460* :  in Paris Andrew Harding has the details. A formal French welcome for China's president Xi Jinping,
*13:06.120- 13:10.800* :  but France and indeed the European Union are starting to take a much tougher line with China.
*13:10.800- 13:17.040* :  A country they now see on many levels as more of a rival than a partner. In Paris the European
*13:17.040- 13:21.780* :  Commission president Ursula von der Leyen made some pointed remarks about the need for tough
*13:21.780- 13:27.740* :  decisions to protect Europe's economy and security. There is growing concern that China
*13:27.740- 13:33.940* :  is flouting international rules and flooding Europe with heavily subsidized goods like electric cars.
*13:34.740- 13:40.360* :  President Emmanuel Macron, often keener to charm them to chastise, has also begun taking a
*13:40.360- 13:46.160* :  tougher line on the war in Ukraine and on China's enduringly close relationship with Russia.
*13:46.160- 13:53.320* :  In a statement after their meeting, Mr. Macron said he was pleased that President Xi
*13:53.320- 13:59.420* :  had vowed not to sell weapons to Russia and to control strictly the export of dual use goods
*13:59.420- 14:06.420* :  that could be used for military purposes. But Mr. Macron noted that the Chinese had made a
*14:06.420- 14:12.780* :  similar promise a year ago. There is open skepticism here about China's global intentions
*14:12.780- 14:19.240* :  and concern about the extent to which Beijing seeks to weaken ties within the European Union
*14:19.840- 14:25.520* :  and between Europe and the United States. Andrew Harding in Paris, our China media analyst
*14:25.520- 14:30.020* :  Carrie Allen told me more about how Xi Jinping's visit is going down back home.
*14:30.400- 14:35.240* :  There's been a lot of fun fair about this trip, so state media have very much wanted to make an
*14:35.240- 14:41.160* :  emphasis that it's been 60 years since China and France established diplomatic ties and that France
*14:41.160- 14:46.400* :  is actually the biggest major Western country that's had ties this long with China.
*14:46.400- 14:50.160* :  So they're saying that there's a very important relationship between China and France.
*14:50.740- 14:55.000* :  That's been the emphasis more than anything that visiting Europe is a positive thing,
*14:55.020- 15:01.200* :  being able to establish trade as part of initiatives like the Belt and Road is very important
*15:01.200- 15:05.800* :  to China. But more than anything, there's been a real emphasis on this relationship between China
*15:05.800- 15:10.800* :  and France and a lot of messaging saying that the two countries are friends and that there's
*15:10.800- 15:16.280* :  the potential for them to establish wider collaboration deals. There's a big focus on trade.
*15:16.720- 15:22.120* :  Do they actually talk about the disputes that the two sides are having or merely trade as a whole?
*15:22.280- 15:26.640* :  Not at all. No, what's interesting is there's no mention of the dispute whatsoever. Instead,
*15:26.640- 15:33.340* :  I think there's a climate in China where state media often paint the West in general as the bad guy.
*15:33.920- 15:39.260* :  So any kind of negative reporting may actually ruffle feathers, but because China recognizes
*15:39.260- 15:45.120* :  that France is an important market to China and vice versa. I mean, for example, luxury fashion
*15:45.120- 15:50.600* :  in China is very, very important to France. It doesn't want to ruffle feathers at this time while
*15:50.600- 15:55.980* :  these talks are taking place. It does recognize that there are benefits to really playing up the
*15:55.980- 16:00.980* :  emphasis on two friendly nations meeting. And what about the other issue at the heart of these talks,
*16:00.980- 16:06.740* :  the war in Ukraine and China's supposed support for Russia? There has been mention of this.
*16:06.760- 16:11.620* :  There's very much been a message that China and France has two large nations that there is
*16:11.620- 16:15.980* :  the potential for the two of them to work together more closely and to bring stability to
*16:15.980- 16:20.480* :  warring nations. I mentioned warring nations because not just the situation with Ukraine,
*16:20.480- 16:25.680* :  there's also a lot of reference to what's happening in Gaza at the moment. A view that comes out
*16:25.680- 16:31.480* :  in China is that France, very much like China, would like to achieve a ceasefire. So there's a hope
*16:31.480- 16:35.260* :  that the two countries can align in that way and promote that messaging.
*16:35.860- 16:41.880* :  Our China media analyst, Keri Allen. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*16:41.880- 16:46.940* :  Russia has repeatedly invoked the threat of nuclear war to try to stop Western nation supporting
*16:46.940- 16:51.420* :  the Ukrainians. Now the Russians say they are planning to hold drills involving tactical
*16:51.420- 16:56.680* :  nuclear weapons near Ukraine in response to, quote, threats by France and the UK.
*16:56.680- 17:01.680* :  The Russian foreign ministry summoned both the French and British ambassadors in Moscow
*17:01.680- 17:07.360* :  to discuss recent statements by President Macron and the British foreign secretary David Cameron.
*17:07.360- 17:11.960* :  NATO has called Russia's threat of nuclear exercises dangerous and irresponsible.
*17:11.960- 17:15.080* :  Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhardt, is following developments.
*17:15.720- 17:19.820* :  Russia's Ministry of Defense said the planned drills would increase the readiness of its
*17:19.820- 17:26.180* :  non-strategic nuclear forces. Short-range tactical nuclear weapons are less powerful than
*17:26.180- 17:32.880* :  strategic ones, but could nevertheless devastate large areas. Some can deliver many times the yield
*17:32.880- 17:40.300* :  of the nuclear bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. Moscow's been angered in part by recent
*17:40.300- 17:45.540* :  comments from President Emmanuel Macron. To the consternation of some allies, he's refused to
*17:45.540- 17:51.100* :  rule out potentially deploying French troops were key of to request that, referencing a need
*17:51.100- 17:57.360* :  for strategic ambiguity. Moscow also denounced remarks last week from Britain's foreign secretary,
*17:57.360- 18:03.320* :  David Cameron, which appeared to suggest Kiev would be free to use British-made weapons on targets
*18:03.320- 18:08.860* :  inside Russia. President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has responded,
*18:09.160- 18:16.560* :  This is a complete, a mere round of escalation of tension. It's unprecedented. Of course,
*18:16.560- 18:21.580* :  it requires special attention and special measures. The foreign ministry in Moscow said it
*18:21.580- 18:26.480* :  hopes the nuclear drills would cool as it put it, the hotheads in western capitals.
*18:27.200- 18:32.260* :  Kiev sees the planned exercises as a continuation of what it calls nuclear blackmail,
*18:32.260- 18:36.860* :  a sentiment broadly echoed by Estonia's Prime Minister Kaya Kalas.
*18:37.060- 18:41.900* :  Russia has threatened with the nuclear arms before. There's so far these have been only threats.
*18:42.480- 18:46.760* :  Can we tell for certain that he's not going to use them? No, we can't, because they have done
*18:46.760- 18:52.560* :  all sorts of crazy things before. But we must understand why they are making these threats,
*18:52.560- 18:58.400* :  to make us refrain from the decisions that we would otherwise make. We shouldn't give in to that.
*18:58.400- 19:03.500* :  The rise in tensions comes on the eve of Mr Putin's re-enorgeration as president,
*19:04.040- 19:08.700* :  and ahead of an annual military parade on Red Square on Thursday to mark victory in the
*19:08.700- 19:15.320* :  Second World War. Danny Overhard. Still to come on the global news podcast?
*19:16.040- 19:21.120* :  Welcome to buy her host, the queen joined President Mitoff in simultaneously cutting a ribbon,
*19:21.120- 19:27.420* :  officially opening the under-channel link. Celebrating 30 years since the opening of the channel
*19:27.620- 19:29.280* :  tunnel linking Britain and France.
*19:37.860- 19:42.700* :  It's clear that Donald Trump is finding it difficult to keep quiet about his criminal trial
*19:42.700- 19:46.920* :  in New York. As the third week of hearings began, the former US president was
*19:46.920- 19:52.780* :  fined $1,000 and held in contempt of court for the tenth time. The judge warned him he could end
*19:52.780- 19:57.900* :  up in jail if he continued violating a gagging order. Meanwhile, the jury has been hearing from
*19:57.900- 20:02.180* :  a current and a former employee of the Trump organization. Our correspondent, let it
*20:02.180- 20:07.100* :  healthy, has been at the court in Manhattan, so could Mr Trump really end up in prison.
*20:07.520- 20:13.240* :  This was the strongest warning we've had from Judge Juan Mershon, and he acknowledged the
*20:13.240- 20:18.640* :  implications of jailing a presidential candidate and the security challenges that would come with
*20:18.640- 20:26.120* :  that given Donald Trump is a former president with a secret service detail. But he said, even though
*20:26.120- 20:31.800* :  it is something he does not want to do, that he's trying to avoid at all costs, that he has a job
*20:31.800- 20:37.220* :  to protect the dignity of the judicial system. So he gave Donald Trump a strong warning, but I think
*20:37.220- 20:43.800* :  it is worth noting here that the judge has been trying to play this very carefully. He found that
*20:43.800- 20:49.200* :  Donald Trump wasn't contempt for making comments about the jury, which he said was a direct
*20:49.200- 20:55.560* :  tack on the rule of law and put them at risk for safety concerns, but other alleged violations
*20:55.560- 21:00.800* :  brought up by prosecutors. Well, the judge said it was protected political speech potentially,
*21:00.800- 21:07.020* :  and so didn't find him for those. So we are seeing the judge trying really hard here to respect
*21:07.020- 21:11.980* :  Donald Trump's right to a free speech and to avoid giving him jail time while trying to make sure
*21:11.980- 21:17.480* :  that this process is respected. Meanwhile, the court has been hearing from witnesses from inside
*21:17.580- 21:24.940* :  the Trump organization. What's been going on? Yeah, we've had our 10th witness, Jeffrey McConney.
*21:24.940- 21:30.120* :  He's a long time controller of the Trump organization. He's no longer with the organization,
*21:30.160- 21:35.560* :  but he was there for 35 years. And prosecutors are essentially trying to prove to the jury
*21:35.560- 21:42.580* :  documents don't lie. They basically introduced with McConney's testimony, a series of invoices,
*21:42.580- 21:49.280* :  ledger entries that they say proves that the Trump organization cooked the books to hide the
*21:49.280- 21:55.760* :  hush money payment. Now, of course, hush money in itself isn't illegal, but the prosecutors here say
*21:55.760- 22:04.140* :  that Donald Trump falsified 34 business records to hide election violations. And so McConney says he
*22:04.140- 22:10.380* :  did meet with Alan Weiselberg, the chief financial officer. He did receive a copy of that wire
*22:10.380- 22:16.460* :  payment from Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels lawyer. And he said that they basically did come up with
*22:16.460- 22:23.620* :  a way to pay Michael Cohen $35,000 a month over a year and that he never saw a legal retainer agreement
*22:23.620- 22:30.180* :  from Michael Cohen. But on cross examination, he acknowledged that Weiselberg never told him what
*22:30.180- 22:35.360* :  the reimbursement to Cohen was for. Neta Talfeek outside court. Meanwhile,
*22:35.360- 22:40.800* :  a few blocks away in New York, the issue of deforestation and how to stop it is high on the agenda
*22:40.800- 22:47.220* :  at this week's UN forum on forests. The study conducted by 15,000 scientists from around the world
*22:47.800- 22:53.300* :  suggests that market-based approaches to forest conservation like carbon offsets and deforestation
*22:53.300- 22:58.720* :  free certification schemes have largely failed to protect trees or alleviate poverty.
*22:58.720- 23:03.900* :  Dr. Constance McDermott is the report's lead author. So if we think just on the surface,
*23:04.280- 23:10.060* :  what is a major driver of deforestation? Well, increasingly, it's global and urban markets for
*23:10.060- 23:16.380* :  key commodities like palm oil and soy and that these commodities are replacing forest cover. But
*23:16.460- 23:23.020* :  underneath this are some major inequalities in global trade and global economies. So in many
*23:23.020- 23:29.240* :  countries with high deforestation rates, both governments and communities lack adequate alternatives
*23:29.260- 23:35.580* :  and the resources to manage land sustainably for their benefit. So market-based approaches
*23:36.220- 23:41.560* :  not only can't compete economically with global commodity expansion, but they don't address these
*23:41.560- 23:46.600* :  underlying governance and economic challenges. In fact, indigenous and local communities that are
*23:46.600- 23:52.520* :  affected by the agricultural expansion lack secure rights to their land and to the forest
*23:52.520- 23:59.220* :  resources. So even in those cases where they would prefer to defend their current livelihoods,
*23:59.220- 24:04.980* :  they're not in a strong position to do so. I think we do need a fundamental rethink, but
*24:05.240- 24:09.600* :  there are also many examples where indigenous and local communities have sustainably managed
*24:09.600- 24:14.980* :  their forests. Leading examples are Mexico and Nepal where a lot of forests rights have been
*24:14.980- 24:21.400* :  handed over to communities and large areas of forest. Many of these examples have been successful.
*24:21.440- 24:28.060* :  Think if we just paid more attention to what is working, how can we support that? And maybe even
*24:28.060- 24:33.780* :  prioritizing those cases where the benefits of doing so are captured more effectively locally,
*24:34.160- 24:37.800* :  rather than thinking that there's some silver bullet that we're going to come up with in New York
*24:37.800- 24:42.340* :  or Tokyo or London or wherever it might be, then I think that would help enormously.
*24:43.060- 24:47.880* :  Dr. Constance McDermott lead author of the report by the International Union of Forest Research
*24:47.880- 24:54.340* :  Organizations. As we record this podcast, the first crude mission of Boeing's starliner is due to
*24:54.340- 25:00.040* :  blast off bound for the International Space Station. The project has suffered delays, but if this
*25:00.040- 25:05.680* :  launch at Cape Canaveral in Florida is successful, Boeing will become the second private company to
*25:05.680- 25:12.340* :  take NASA astronauts to the space station after SpaceX Palabgosh reports. It's been a long
*25:12.340- 25:18.280* :  road for Boeing's starliner to the launch pad. Its first uncrewed test flight in 2019
*25:18.280- 25:23.500* :  didn't make it to the space station because a software fault caused the spacecraft's engines
*25:23.500- 25:29.960* :  to misfire. A second attempt in 2022 did make it, but there were issues with some thrusters
*25:29.960- 25:35.840* :  and the craft's cooling system. Meanwhile, Boeing's rival Elon Musk's SpaceX
*25:35.840- 25:41.820* :  docked its dragon spacecraft four years ago and has varied crews and cargo ever since.
*25:42.360- 25:47.780* :  On Earth, Boeing has been facing growing scrutiny because of faults with some of its aircraft.
*25:48.440- 25:54.060* :  Dr. Simian Barber of the Open University says it's important for the company that this test flight
*25:54.060- 25:59.620* :  goes smoothly. It's a really big day for Boeing. They've been working on starliner for 10 years
*25:59.620- 26:04.580* :  at least. This is the big one. This is the first test flight with humans on board. They've had
*26:04.580- 26:09.240* :  few problems on early test flights, I think it's fair to say. There's a lot riding on this one.
*26:09.520- 26:15.580* :  Boeing's commercial crew program manager, Mark Napi, said the delays were a normal part of the
*26:15.580- 26:21.440* :  development of a new spacecraft, and starliner was now ready to fly with its first crew.
*26:21.700- 26:27.180* :  Design and development, it's constant ups and downs, but the overall slope is always up. We're
*26:27.180- 26:30.500* :  basically at the top of that slope and now starting to get into operations.
*26:30.920- 26:35.960* :  Starliner can carry up to seven astronauts into low Earth orbit, but this time it'll be
*26:35.960- 26:41.020* :  carrying just two. During the mission, the astronauts will test their spacesuits and seats,
*26:41.680- 26:47.660* :  and assess on-board life support and navigation systems. On the way back, they'll experience
*26:47.660- 26:53.140* :  Starliner's landing system, which will touch down on land in the deserts of the southwestern
*26:53.140- 26:59.240* :  United States. If all goes to plan, Starliner will be certified for regular supply missions to
*26:59.240- 27:05.640* :  the space station. Our science correspondent, Palab Goche, and from space to undersea travel.
*27:06.100- 27:11.900* :  30 years ago, an idea dreamed up in the 17th century became a reality when the channel tunnel,
*27:11.900- 27:17.720* :  linking Britain and France officially opened. It laid the tracks for the Euro Star train service,
*27:17.720- 27:22.320* :  which shuttles passengers from London to Paris and beyond, and the Euro tunnel, which
*27:22.320- 27:27.340* :  carries vehicles and freight. The BBC's Mike Smart reported on the moment when the late Queen
*27:27.340- 27:32.900* :  Elizabeth officially opened the tunnel in 1994, traveling to meet the then French president in
*27:32.900- 27:38.420* :  Calais. Her Majesty's train entered the tunnel at Folkston to applause from those on hold.
*27:40.340- 27:44.580* :  Emerging half an hour later in France, where the president's train was waiting at the platform
*27:44.580- 27:50.680* :  in Calais. Safety normally precludes two trains traveling on the same line in opposite directions,
*27:50.680- 27:56.320* :  but today the French and British locomotives came to rest, nose-to-nose, feet apart.
*27:57.300- 28:02.460* :  Welcomeed by her host, the Queen joined President Mitoir in simultaneously cutting a ribbon,
*28:02.460- 28:09.620* :  officially opening the under-channel link. And that was Mike Smart, my first boss and a former
*28:09.620- 28:15.600* :  BBC correspondent. Well, our current transport correspondent Katie Austin has more details about
*28:15.600- 28:22.640* :  the anniversary. Since the Queen made her journey through the channel tunnel, 480 million passengers
*28:22.780- 28:29.820* :  have done the same. These days, 400 trains speed through it each day. We're now going at about 120
*28:29.900- 28:35.380* :  kilometres per hour, which is roughly 75 miles per hour, and we're coming up to the middle
*28:35.380- 28:40.940* :  of what is still the world's longest undersea tunnel. Driver Martin has been here since the
*28:40.940- 28:44.940* :  beginning. People have this concept that it's just straight through to France and it's totally
*28:44.940- 28:50.720* :  not. The tunnel itself is up down around the corners and everything is no straight lines at all.
*28:50.860- 28:54.820* :  So you sort of know this tunnel at the back of your hand? Absolutely, yeah, it's like a second
*28:54.820- 29:01.320* :  home, really. Building it was an exceptional feat of engineering. There are actually three tunnels,
*29:01.320- 29:05.460* :  the one I'm standing in right now with my high-risk and my hard-hat, isn't for trains,
*29:05.460- 29:10.920* :  it's used for ventilation, access for maintenance and evacuating people in an emergency.
*29:14.020- 29:17.640* :  The tunnel carries a quarter of trade between the UK and the EU.
*29:18.820- 29:22.620* :  Plus plenty of holiday makers, whether on the Eurostar to Paris and beyond,
*29:22.620- 29:28.260* :  or using the car shuttle to reach somewhere like Le Touquet, an hours drive from Euro Tunnel's
*29:28.260- 29:34.360* :  Calais Terminal. Tunnel tourists help keep the wheels moving for small businesses,
*29:35.020- 29:40.200* :  including this one. I drive the little train, lots of English people come at the weekend,
*29:40.200- 29:47.280* :  in cars, in the shuttle, it's very good. Plenty of brits swing by the town's golf course.
*29:47.940- 29:55.140* :  Every year we've got 45,000 visitors and basically 20,000 of those visitors are English people.
*29:55.360- 29:59.520* :  Charles thinks the shorter journey compared to Ferries means a longer holiday.
*29:59.960- 30:05.000* :  There's an extra round of golf, so that's more fun for them and more business for us.
*30:05.660- 30:11.160* :  The tunnel's financial journey hasn't always been smooth. It opened two billion pounds over budget.
*30:11.660- 30:16.360* :  At one point the company which runs it nearly went bust, predicted passenger numbers were
*30:16.360- 30:23.820* :  never reached, but Euro Tunnel became profitable. More recently, new challenges. The pandemic and
*30:23.820- 30:28.760* :  Brexit meant putting millions into new systems to deal with additional customs rules.
*30:28.840- 30:34.560* :  Euro Tunnel is building an area to cope with the EU's new border system starting this October.
*30:34.740- 30:40.960* :  The crossing time will be extended by five to maximum seven minutes for each customers,
*30:40.960- 30:46.620* :  and as we have extended the number of lanes, there will be no delay on the highway, nothing.
*30:47.280- 30:50.580* :  A map report by our Transport Correspondent Katie Oster.
*30:53.200- 30:56.680* :  That is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
