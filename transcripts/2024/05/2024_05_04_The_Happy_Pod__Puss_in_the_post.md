*01:18.800- 01:21.360* :  This is the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.280- 01:28.960* :  I'm Paul Moss and in this edition, I've loaded on Saturday the 3rd of May.
*01:29.220- 01:33.060* :  It was just really odd and unusual that we couldn't find her anywhere.
*01:33.060- 01:37.340* :  We tore our house apart trying to find her.
*01:37.620- 01:41.600* :  The cat whose love of boxes took her hundreds of kilometers from home.
*01:42.360- 01:47.880* :  Also, the small sticky patch that could save lives as an alternative way to give vaccinations.
*01:47.880- 01:50.220* :  There's been a lot of excitement about the result.
*01:50.260- 01:54.700* :  This is really now moving the field forward to something that now could be game-changing.
*01:55.120- 02:01.920* :  We'll also hear about the killer whale calf trapped in a Canadian lagoon and how it finally swam to safety.
*02:02.380- 02:05.580* :  It was just extraordinary. I was beside myself.
*02:05.800- 02:08.280* :  I was so proud of brave little hunter.
*02:08.280- 02:11.000* :  It felt wonderful to know that she finally had a chance.
*02:11.000- 02:11.840* :  It's incredible.
*02:12.400- 02:16.660* :  Also in this podcast, we hear from players in a blind football league that's
*02:16.660- 02:19.180* :  helping to tackle discrimination in South Sudan.
*02:24.540- 02:28.100* :  And we hear from listeners about the joy of moving to a new country.
*02:33.640- 02:37.240* :  Now, each week the team here at happy pod headquarters have an
*02:37.500- 02:42.100* :  uncharacteristically serious debate about what should be the main story.
*02:42.100- 02:44.980* :  This week, though, the conversation wasn't too heated,
*02:45.640- 02:49.220* :  as there was universal agreement about the news that really mattered.
*02:49.640- 02:55.060* :  And that, of course, is the tale of the cat, which mysteriously went missing in the US for a week,
*02:55.700- 02:58.380* :  and turned up hundreds of kilometers from home.
*02:58.800- 03:02.660* :  Galena usually spends her days indoors with her owners in Utah,
*03:03.320- 03:08.080* :  but was found inside a box at an Amazon warehouse in California.
*03:08.460- 03:11.420* :  My colleague, Nick Myles, spoke to Galena's owner, Carrie Clarke,
*03:11.900- 03:15.380* :  who described first their alarm that their pet had gone missing.
*03:16.060- 03:19.820* :  It was just really odd and unusual that we couldn't find her anywhere.
*03:20.380- 03:24.300* :  She's an indoor-only cat, and she's also the kind of cat who, like,
*03:24.300- 03:27.520* :  always stays by my side wherever I go in my house.
*03:27.880- 03:31.640* :  We tore our house apart trying to find her.
*03:31.920- 03:35.860* :  Everything that we looked into, every possible idea that we could think of,
*03:36.080- 03:37.520* :  she was just nowhere to be found.
*03:37.800- 03:41.040* :  Okay, so further down the line, days pass,
*03:41.100- 03:44.280* :  you must have been getting more and more desperate to let's what happened.
*03:44.700- 03:46.180* :  Yes, so seven days passed,
*03:46.280- 03:50.240* :  when we had gotten friends and family together searching for her,
*03:50.880- 03:56.000* :  I started to give up and lose hope, feeling like I would never find out what happened to her.
*03:56.720- 04:01.700* :  And then miraculously that afternoon, I received a text
*04:02.060- 04:04.880* :  informing me that Galena's microchip had been scanned,
*04:05.960- 04:08.580* :  and within 30 seconds of receiving that text,
*04:09.120- 04:13.660* :  I got a phone call from a mysterious caller who told me
*04:13.700- 04:18.960* :  that they had my cat Galena, and she was currently in California,
*04:18.960- 04:23.020* :  which is 650 miles away from my home in Utah,
*04:23.340- 04:24.140* :  her home in Utah.
*04:24.800- 04:30.640* :  So we eventually found out through the caller that she was a vet in California,
*04:31.320- 04:35.680* :  and Brandi Hunter had found her at the Amazon warehouse.
*04:36.240- 04:38.740* :  They take their time sending the returns back.
*04:38.740- 04:43.380* :  Unfortunately, the reality of it was that Galena was trapped in that box
*04:43.820- 04:45.580* :  without food and water for six days.
*04:45.880- 04:47.740* :  And how did she survive?
*04:47.740- 04:49.340* :  I mean, that's a huge amount of time.
*04:49.740- 04:50.640* :  Without a motive.
*04:51.660- 04:51.700* :  I know.
*04:51.700- 04:54.520* :  There were so many miracles that led up to her surviving.
*04:55.620- 05:00.360* :  Like the first miracle was that the box that she was stuck in, that she was trapped in.
*05:00.980- 05:04.760* :  Well, first of all, it was a really, really large oversized box,
*05:05.200- 05:08.900* :  and it had five pairs of steel-toed boots in it.
*05:09.620- 05:12.220* :  What ended up happening, I have to kind of backtrack a little bit.
*05:12.940- 05:15.280* :  When my husband boxed up the package of the boot,
*05:15.700- 05:18.720* :  he checked the box and made sure everything was in order,
*05:19.340- 05:24.720* :  and then he closed the flap and walked over to another room to get tape and scissors.
*05:25.680- 05:29.200* :  And when he came back, he just put the tape over the box,
*05:29.200- 05:32.840* :  assuming everything was fine, the only thing we could dig up
*05:33.140- 05:36.480* :  that must have happened is that Galena had snuck into that box.
*05:36.840- 05:40.980* :  So Galena makes her way back home, Ultimate Lynn.
*05:40.980- 05:42.420* :  And what was the reunion like?
*05:42.760- 05:47.560* :  Being able to be reunited with Galena is something that I will never forget.
*05:48.580- 05:50.920* :  We write as we heard that she was in California,
*05:50.940- 05:53.820* :  and we heard the ordeal that she had gone through.
*05:54.300- 05:57.180* :  And we just, you know, flew out to see her as fast as we could
*05:57.180- 06:00.640* :  and bring her back home to us because we just adore our cat.
*06:01.200- 06:02.680* :  I'm so happy she's okay now.
*06:02.680- 06:05.160* :  That's what matters the most is she's okay now.
*06:05.520- 06:07.400* :  Are you going to fit it with a GPS tracker now?
*06:07.740- 06:09.160* :  Yes, she's wearing it right now.
*06:09.160- 06:11.240* :  She's actually by my side at the moment.
*06:12.020- 06:15.080* :  So now she is wearing a collar with an air tag on it,
*06:15.400- 06:17.600* :  and I can track her with my phone.
*06:18.020- 06:19.660* :  They're so happy to have her back home.
*06:19.660- 06:21.240* :  And if I could just say one last thing,
*06:21.680- 06:23.520* :  please consider microchipping your pets.
*06:23.520- 06:26.700* :  That's the way that we were able to get Galena back to us.
*06:27.300- 06:30.900* :  And to triple check your packages that are delivered out.
*06:31.300- 06:34.520* :  Kerry Clark, and I've got to say that if that has nine lives,
*06:34.520- 06:37.740* :  I reckon it's presumably used up at least two or three of them.
*06:38.460- 06:41.440* :  Next to a small invention that could have a big impact,
*06:41.740- 06:43.360* :  saving lives around the world.
*06:44.160- 06:48.260* :  And can I be honest, it's also rather welcome used to me personally.
*06:48.260- 06:52.200* :  It's a bit embarrassing, but strictly between you and me,
*06:52.200- 06:55.100* :  I have a real phobia about injections.
*06:56.060- 06:59.780* :  So I was delighted to hear that medical researchers have come up with an alternative.
*06:59.780- 07:02.320* :  It's a patch, a bit like a sticking plaster,
*07:02.920- 07:04.760* :  that you can use to give vaccinations.
*07:04.920- 07:06.920* :  That it's aimed primarily at children.
*07:07.680- 07:09.620* :  But in fact, it could help adults too,
*07:09.620- 07:12.560* :  because unlike the liquid they put in hyperdermic needles,
*07:13.220- 07:15.360* :  the patch doesn't need to be kept cold.
*07:15.860- 07:18.160* :  So it's possible to use it in remote places,
*07:18.160- 07:20.380* :  which perhaps don't have refrigeration.
*07:20.740- 07:23.580* :  The device has just been successfully tested in the Gambia,
*07:23.580- 07:27.920* :  by a team affiliated to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
*07:28.600- 07:31.540* :  I spoke to two of the team involved, Dr. Mahamed Yisa,
*07:32.040- 07:36.240* :  and Professor Ed Clark, who first explained in more detail how it worked.
*07:37.040- 07:40.600* :  So rather than being given with the normal needle and syringe to the normal injection,
*07:40.600- 07:45.320* :  that people are used to, the same vaccine is embedded within these tiny micro needles.
*07:45.320- 07:48.440* :  So to speak on the back of what looks really like a sticking plaster
*07:48.920- 07:50.540* :  and the micro needles penetrate the skin.
*07:50.540- 07:51.660* :  So they go through the skin,
*07:52.100- 07:55.100* :  essentially painlessly with some very minor sort of sensation.
*07:55.100- 07:58.540* :  They dissolve very rapidly, and they deliver the vaccine.
*07:58.920- 08:01.000* :  So is this just a matter of convenience,
*08:01.000- 08:04.960* :  something rather nice for those of us who don't appreciate needles very much?
*08:04.960- 08:06.040* :  Or is there more to it?
*08:06.740- 08:10.940* :  One critical benefit is that they're easy to administer by people who are not
*08:10.940- 08:13.840* :  healthcare professionals, that they're expected to be easy to administer,
*08:13.840- 08:16.260* :  following very brief training by volunteers.
*08:16.260- 08:21.860* :  The other perhaps most important advantage again from our perspective in West Africa is that
*08:21.860- 08:25.420* :  they don't need to be stored in the fridge in the same way that normal vaccines do.
*08:25.780- 08:29.760* :  So this means it's easier to reach the most hard to reach vulnerable populations of children
*08:29.760- 08:32.480* :  who may be a long way from standard healthcare facilities.
*08:33.000- 08:34.940* :  Mahamed Yisa, if I can bring you in here,
*08:35.180- 08:41.100* :  I know that medical scientists like you can spend years and decades pursuing a line of research,
*08:41.100- 08:43.760* :  all for nothing, or not much significant gain.
*08:43.760- 08:48.120* :  How's it been to see that this does look like it's going to benefit an awful lot of people?
*08:48.500- 08:52.780* :  It's always good to see that the efforts that you have put in
*08:53.240- 08:57.280* :  has such potential to change lives around the world.
*08:57.660- 08:59.900* :  Be honest, Mahamed, when you were doing this trial,
*08:59.900- 09:02.900* :  were you pretty confident that the patch was going to work,
*09:02.900- 09:06.360* :  or were you really waiting with, I don't know, baited breath to see
*09:06.360- 09:08.740* :  if it really did have the effect you wanted?
*09:09.180- 09:15.100* :  When we started the trial, the technology itself was very fascinating, especially because
*09:16.180- 09:20.220* :  it had a lot of promise of being pain free and all that.
*09:20.840- 09:26.040* :  So I was hoping for it to work because of the advantages, yes,
*09:26.040- 09:28.620* :  but I have no idea if it was going to or not.
*09:29.060- 09:29.560* :  8 o'clock?
*09:29.620- 09:32.000* :  We were obviously the first people to see the data here in the Gambia,
*09:32.000- 09:34.820* :  so it was a really big day and I remember looking at it with my colleagues,
*09:34.820- 09:37.980* :  this patch has been developed over actually decades
*09:37.980- 09:42.620* :  high colleagues in the US Centers for Disease Control and other organisations.
*09:42.620- 09:46.980* :  So I know, you know, when we again, when we gave the data to them and showed them the data,
*09:47.380- 09:51.080* :  it was a really big day and there's been a lot of excitement about the results since.
*09:51.360- 09:55.180* :  This trial has you using the patches to deliver the vaccine for
*09:55.180- 10:00.100* :  for measles and rubella, but I mean, are you going to be trying to use it for other vaccinations
*10:00.100- 10:02.840* :  that would be important in that part of the world?
*10:03.120- 10:06.920* :  There is a real drive now. We've got this data and a lot of interest in using
*10:06.940- 10:10.500* :  these patches or this technology for delivering other vaccines.
*10:11.140- 10:14.220* :  The same similar technology has been used in adults already, in fact,
*10:14.220- 10:16.680* :  just to deliver flu vaccines in the US.
*10:16.680- 10:18.640* :  So this is obviously a very different population.
*10:18.640- 10:24.160* :  So if it is left to me, I would like to see maybe every other vaccine on the schedule
*10:24.800- 10:29.980* :  delivered by patch, maybe the option to choose needle and syringe or a patch.
*10:30.240- 10:32.800* :  That's one thing I would like to see in an annual world.
*10:32.900- 10:36.120* :  This is really now a big hurdle to moving the field forward
*10:36.120- 10:39.980* :  from most first ideas to something that now could be game-changing.
*10:40.580- 10:42.260* :  Ed Clark and Mohammed Yisa.
*10:43.480- 10:48.100* :  It has the honour of being the world's newest nation, but South Sudan has had more than
*10:48.100- 10:53.600* :  its fair share of troubles. It was born out of a long war to win independence from Sudan itself
*10:53.600- 10:59.540* :  with victory finally coming in 2011 and has been beset by its own divisions ever since.
*10:59.860- 11:03.560* :  But if there's one thing that unites South Sudan's disparate people,
*11:04.120- 11:05.120* :  it's a love of football.
*11:05.320- 11:08.560* :  Indeed, despite suffering poverty and ongoing violence,
*11:08.560- 11:11.920* :  football still looms large in people's lists of concerns.
*11:12.700- 11:16.260* :  And more recently, a different version of the sport has been gaining popularity
*11:16.260- 11:19.680* :  with a launch last year of a blind people's football league.
*11:20.520- 11:21.200* :  Rebecca Wood reports.
*11:24.200- 11:25.200* :  The shout from a teammate.
*11:28.120- 11:29.260* :  And a goal.
*11:29.660- 11:32.240* :  The sounds of a football training practice underway,
*11:32.960- 11:34.780* :  but these players can't see their teammates.
*11:34.780- 11:37.040* :  The goal or the ball.
*11:37.360- 11:38.340* :  I'm called Jimmy just.
*11:39.000- 11:41.360* :  Jimmy just addressed him and the nickname is Messi.
*11:41.900- 11:45.060* :  It was in 2012 when I lost my sight.
*11:45.640- 11:47.180* :  My name is Jonas Arbre.
*11:47.180- 11:51.460* :  I was a player before in one of the division team in South Sudan.
*11:52.060- 11:53.100* :  So it is very unfortunate.
*11:53.600- 11:54.220* :  I've got blind.
*11:54.600- 11:58.120* :  In a sport where sight has no place, sound is everything.
*11:58.600- 12:01.380* :  Simon Madal is head coach and technical director
*12:01.880- 12:04.240* :  for the blind football Premier League in South Sudan.
*12:04.640- 12:06.460* :  We have five players in the field.
*12:06.660- 12:08.480* :  The goalkeeper is someone who is sighted.
*12:08.640- 12:10.220* :  So also, I cast a guy.
*12:10.440- 12:10.860* :  Arachute.
*12:11.980- 12:12.720* :  Nice one. Nice one.
*12:12.720- 12:16.940* :  And we have the coach with I cast the guy in the middle of the field.
*12:17.320- 12:21.000* :  And most importantly, our ball has a jingling sound in time.
*12:23.220- 12:27.600* :  And also, there are some words that we say, for example, if a player is attacking,
*12:27.600- 12:30.260* :  he has to say boy, boy, boy, Moses.
*12:30.620- 12:33.140* :  Because you cannot just come silent and be trying to attach.
*12:33.560- 12:37.060* :  Set up during COVID in 2020 with help from the organization
*12:37.060- 12:41.140* :  Light for the World, from small beginnings, it's gone from strength to strength.
*12:41.780- 12:44.680* :  No mean feat in a nation torn apart by conflict.
*12:44.680- 12:49.220* :  We started only with two players, but today we are reaching hundreds now.
*12:49.560- 12:51.300* :  The sport is for people who are vision impaired,
*12:51.960- 12:55.260* :  but we also think that it's very important for us to also train people
*12:55.260- 12:56.260* :  who are not vision impaired.
*12:56.600- 12:59.600* :  Raising awareness of disability inclusion in ways like this
*12:59.600- 13:03.340* :  and challenging the stigma faced by the nation's disabled population
*13:03.340- 13:07.200* :  is the aim of the league, as well as having a positive influence
*13:07.200- 13:09.720* :  on the lives of people like Jonah and Jimmy.
*13:10.020- 13:12.940* :  When I'm playing, I feel like I don't have disabilities.
*13:12.940- 13:13.940* :  I'm very happy.
*13:14.580- 13:16.520* :  I got blind from there.
*13:16.940- 13:18.640* :  I said, two good years at home.
*13:19.060- 13:20.120* :  Even I don't know what to do.
*13:20.140- 13:20.900* :  I lose hope.
*13:21.280- 13:23.140* :  Now I'm feeling so proud.
*13:23.740- 13:26.920* :  Of course, it's not just in South Sudan, your fine-blind football.
*13:26.920- 13:29.760* :  It's been a Paralympic sport since 2004
*13:30.280- 13:33.160* :  and has more than 60 internationally recognised teams
*13:33.160- 13:37.700* :  with Argentina, Brazil and Japan top of the men's leaderboard.
*13:38.540- 13:41.720* :  For Simon, Jimmy and Jonah, heading abroad is their dream.
*13:42.200- 13:44.440* :  And while that may seem a far off goal for now,
*13:44.840- 13:46.560* :  they believe anything is possible
*13:46.560- 13:49.340* :  with growing interest and team spirit.
*13:49.740- 13:52.780* :  A lot of people, they enjoy our playing.
*13:52.780- 13:56.540* :  We come from a different state, different drive,
*13:56.540- 14:00.060* :  but through these blind footballs, it has united us.
*14:00.220- 14:01.060* :  We're like family.
*14:01.060- 14:02.840* :  Good, very nice.
*14:02.840- 14:04.560* :  Very nice.
*14:04.820- 14:05.560* :  Nice one, yeah, captain.
*14:05.920- 14:07.640* :  That report from Rebecca Wood.
*14:12.700- 14:13.840* :  Coming up in this podcast.
*14:13.840- 14:15.000* :  We gave them a bow.
*14:15.340- 14:16.260* :  When they rang the bow,
*14:16.260- 14:18.240* :  then the owner would come over
*14:18.500- 14:19.440* :  and present them with a tablet.
*14:19.880- 14:21.520* :  And there was profile photos on the tablet
*14:21.520- 14:22.880* :  and the parrot could use their tongue
*14:22.880- 14:24.860* :  to select the profile photo on the screen.
*14:25.400- 14:27.720* :  The highly social, tech-savvy parents.

*15:07.700- 15:08.440* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*15:08.440- 15:10.900* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team
*15:10.900- 15:12.620* :  if big wireless companies are allowed
*15:12.620- 15:14.500* :  to raise prices due to inflation.
*15:14.920- 15:15.520* :  They said yes.
*15:15.940- 15:17.660* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically
*15:17.660- 15:19.920* :  violates those owners to your contracts,
*15:19.920- 15:22.300* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*15:22.320- 15:23.900* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*15:24.140- 15:26.600* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*15:26.600- 15:29.480* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*15:43.600- 15:45.860* :  In the last episode, we asked for your stories
*15:46.280- 15:49.220* :  about how moving to a new country has made you happy.
*15:50.000- 15:52.280* :  Well, Shirley, Marco Tynan got in touch.
*15:52.280- 15:55.820* :  20 years ago, she swapped Texas for El Salvador.
*15:56.500- 15:59.700* :  Not too far geographically, but worlds apart in other ways.
*16:00.120- 16:02.680* :  Shirley left with her husband and two young children
*16:03.240- 16:05.700* :  to help open a new facility for a computer firm.
*16:05.860- 16:07.740* :  She told the happy pods Isabella Jewel
*16:08.180- 16:09.880* :  why they decided to make this move.
*16:10.540- 16:12.500* :  I grew up a military child.
*16:13.000- 16:15.620* :  And so I was used to living abroad.
*16:15.660- 16:18.420* :  And I just think the excitement of it.
*16:18.680- 16:19.980* :  Learning a new culture.
*16:20.660- 16:23.300* :  And I wanted to expose that for my children too.
*16:23.880- 16:25.960* :  You learned something different than you've grown up with.
*16:26.520- 16:30.920* :  I think our biggest issue became our language.
*16:31.180- 16:32.460* :  The children started school.
*16:32.460- 16:36.720* :  And the school spent half their time speaking Spanish
*16:36.720- 16:39.240* :  doing history, math, all in Spanish.
*16:39.880- 16:41.500* :  And then half the time in English.
*16:42.340- 16:44.280* :  So that the other people that were from El Salvador
*16:44.280- 16:46.460* :  would be learning English at the same time.
*16:46.460- 16:48.100* :  So we were the opposite.
*16:48.560- 16:50.240* :  We took Spanish classes the whole time.
*16:50.240- 16:53.000* :  And I think at the end, I was okay.
*16:53.720- 16:55.800* :  Can you tell me a little bit about some of the other
*16:55.800- 16:58.320* :  culture shocks you might have experienced moving.
*16:58.320- 17:00.420* :  This is obviously a very different place from the states.
*17:01.040- 17:03.320* :  El Salvador can be a rough place.
*17:04.080- 17:07.120* :  We tried to think of it as living in a big city.
*17:07.180- 17:10.260* :  There's probably places you can go to, can't go to.
*17:11.000- 17:15.940* :  So when you go to a grocery store or if you go to a pharmacy,
*17:16.460- 17:18.840* :  you'll see a lot of armed security guards.
*17:19.180- 17:19.880* :  Even on the beach.
*17:20.240- 17:22.600* :  I think that that for a little bit, it took us back.
*17:23.180- 17:25.620* :  But then it became quite normal time.
*17:25.860- 17:27.320* :  Oh, that's a big one.
*17:27.960- 17:30.860* :  In the US, you're very conscious of time.
*17:30.860- 17:32.400* :  So you arrive to a party.
*17:32.980- 17:34.540* :  You know, if they say the party starts at seven,
*17:34.540- 17:36.440* :  you probably arrive a little before seven.
*17:37.080- 17:39.360* :  And that never happens in El Salvador.
*17:40.760- 17:44.500* :  And it took us probably a couple years to realize that, you know,
*17:45.360- 17:47.100* :  people are much more relaxed about time.
*17:47.100- 17:49.600* :  Even 30 minutes late is okay.
*17:51.160- 17:53.120* :  It was a much more relaxed approach to thing.
*17:53.140- 17:56.040* :  You don't get so uptight about everything.
*17:56.960- 17:59.100* :  So would you say, coming away from that experience,
*17:59.100- 18:03.140* :  you're happier now in your everyday lives because you've bought
*18:03.140- 18:05.460* :  aspects of the culture from El Salvador?
*18:06.160- 18:07.320* :  We are definitely happier.
*18:07.320- 18:10.960* :  And I think that we look at things differently.
*18:11.680- 18:16.380* :  And if you had one piece of advice to someone or a family who wanted to move
*18:16.380- 18:18.560* :  to the other side of the world or to a different country,
*18:18.560- 18:19.380* :  what would it be?
*18:19.860- 18:21.060* :  I would say definitely do it.
*18:21.060- 18:23.180* :  It's an opportunity for you and for your family.
*18:23.800- 18:26.280* :  Think about where you're going to live,
*18:27.300- 18:28.920* :  where you're going to send your children to school,
*18:29.240- 18:30.620* :  and how you're going to approach it.
*18:30.920- 18:33.180* :  If you're going to move to another country, embrace it.
*18:33.500- 18:34.320* :  Learn all you can.
*18:34.680- 18:37.720* :  Don't try to stay in a bubble and just stay with your own culture
*18:37.720- 18:39.100* :  and your own ways of doing things.
*18:39.600- 18:40.600* :  Shirley Mark with Tyna.
*18:40.600- 18:44.120* :  And if moving to a new country has had a positive effect on your life,
*18:44.640- 18:45.640* :  we'd love to hear from you.
*18:46.800- 18:50.740* :  Now, the name Killer Whale isn't exactly designed to inspire sympathy.
*18:50.740- 18:53.500* :  It sounds more like a creature from a scary movie.
*18:54.280- 18:57.360* :  But despite their menacing name Killer Whales or Orcas,
*18:57.520- 19:01.720* :  it's been most of their time eating fish and their very rarely a danger to humans.
*19:01.720- 19:07.260* :  On the contrary, they seem to inspire intense affection from those who get to know them as individuals.
*19:07.880- 19:11.000* :  That's what I learned when I heard the story of a very young Killer Whale
*19:11.340- 19:14.800* :  who ended up stranded in a Canadian lagoon the mother had died.
*19:15.460- 19:18.280* :  And her orphan daughter was nicknamed Brave Little Hunter
*19:18.280- 19:19.480* :  by the local community.
*19:20.000- 19:23.020* :  And they then got involved in the many attempts to rescue her.
*19:23.460- 19:25.120* :  I learned all this from Rob John,
*19:25.120- 19:27.600* :  who comes from the Ijartisat First Nation.
*19:28.200- 19:32.320* :  And also Jared Tarras from the Whale Conservation Group base cytology.
*19:32.940- 19:35.360* :  He explained first why there was some urgency
*19:35.380- 19:38.020* :  in getting Brave Little Hunter back to sea.
*19:38.700- 19:40.660* :  Being that Killer Whales are social animals,
*19:41.100- 19:43.560* :  they really rely on other Killer Whales
*19:43.760- 19:45.440* :  to thrive and survive.
*19:45.440- 19:50.280* :  And unfortunately, being that this Killer Whale was in a very unusual place,
*19:50.940- 19:54.160* :  it had a very small chance of connecting with family.
*19:54.840- 19:57.540* :  Also being that it was only a two and a half-year-old calf,
*19:58.280- 20:02.900* :  we were a bit worried about what kind of food resources were there for it.
*20:03.380- 20:07.520* :  Rob John, what was the reaction of the community that you live in
*20:07.520- 20:10.720* :  to the presence of this orphan Killer Whale?
*20:10.980- 20:14.100* :  It was definitely the top of the list,
*20:14.100- 20:16.940* :  the conversations people lined up on the beaches
*20:16.940- 20:18.940* :  just to view the incident.
*20:19.520- 20:22.920* :  Now you then jointly, as a community,
*20:22.920- 20:26.320* :  tried to rescue the Killer Whale,
*20:26.320- 20:27.620* :  tried to get her out to sea.
*20:27.620- 20:28.980* :  How did you go about that?
*20:29.240- 20:31.700* :  We have found a recording of Whale's great hands.
*20:31.700- 20:33.520* :  And if they hear another Killer Whale,
*20:33.520- 20:35.580* :  then they usually want to socialize.
*20:35.860- 20:38.220* :  And the Whale slam in the opposite direction.
*20:38.220- 20:43.060* :  Almost like she potentially knew that it was a hoax.
*20:43.400- 20:45.200* :  That tried and tested method didn't work,
*20:45.200- 20:46.700* :  and the other methods hadn't worked either.
*20:46.700- 20:47.860* :  How are you feeling about this?
*20:48.120- 20:49.720* :  I think we were feeling the pressure.
*20:50.260- 20:51.840* :  Those of us on site really cared.
*20:52.140- 20:53.680* :  You know, giving up was not an option.
*20:53.680- 20:56.200* :  So we were pretty dedicated and focused.
*20:56.560- 20:57.000* :  Rob John?
*20:57.160- 20:59.660* :  I was very concerned with the whole situation.
*21:00.060- 21:04.020* :  I just continued on feeding her, visiting her,
*21:04.060- 21:05.280* :  and singing to her.
*21:05.820- 21:06.700* :  You sang to her?
*21:06.920- 21:07.640* :  Yes, I did.
*21:07.640- 21:09.960* :  Yes. Well, I was in my little zodiac.
*21:10.320- 21:11.280* :  My small boat there.
*21:11.280- 21:14.100* :  I was out in the lagoon with her and feeding her by hand.
*21:14.100- 21:18.840* :  I was singing to her in our language and using her culture.
*21:19.400- 21:22.060* :  Rob, there's all these elaborate efforts going on
*21:22.100- 21:25.060* :  to coax brave little hunter out to sea.
*21:25.340- 21:28.500* :  But then it seems she just went of her own accord.
*21:28.500- 21:29.160* :  Is that right?
*21:29.480- 21:32.100* :  It was a long thought, effort, you know,
*21:32.100- 21:34.400* :  after we established a good connection,
*21:34.920- 21:36.400* :  my coworker and I, you know,
*21:36.400- 21:37.560* :  she was coming to the boat.
*21:37.560- 21:39.880* :  She was following and she was feeding
*21:40.400- 21:42.880* :  straight from the surface beside the boat at this point.
*21:42.880- 21:46.720* :  And we guided her to the sand bar
*21:46.800- 21:49.660* :  and she was still reluctant to travel over the sand bar.
*21:49.660- 21:52.920* :  So I started going back and forth over the sand bar
*21:53.160- 21:55.160* :  just going her that it was safe.
*21:55.440- 21:57.840* :  How did it feel to see brave little hunter
*21:57.840- 21:59.500* :  back out in the back out in the sea?
*21:59.500- 22:00.600* :  How was that for you?
*22:00.700- 22:02.060* :  It was just extraordinary.
*22:02.060- 22:03.920* :  I was beside myself.
*22:04.160- 22:06.560* :  I was so proud of brave little hunter
*22:06.560- 22:09.180* :  for gaining the courage and each obstacle
*22:09.180- 22:10.420* :  that she had to go through.
*22:10.420- 22:12.280* :  She put her trust in us.
*22:12.380- 22:13.100* :  Gerrataas?
*22:13.420- 22:14.160* :  Well, it was amazing.
*22:14.220- 22:16.940* :  It had been over a month and it felt
*22:16.940- 22:19.180* :  wonderful to know that she finally had a chance
*22:19.640- 22:21.300* :  and it still feels that way.
*22:21.300- 22:21.880* :  It's incredible.
*22:22.460- 22:24.100* :  Gerrataas and Rob John.
*22:25.180- 22:27.060* :  It's 24 years since UNESCO
*22:27.060- 22:30.120* :  named its first annual World Book Capital
*22:30.680- 22:32.660* :  and the United Nations Education Agency
*22:32.660- 22:34.140* :  has just selected the latest one
*22:34.140- 22:35.860* :  at Strasbourg in Eastern France.
*22:36.660- 22:39.460* :  The idea of awarding the title is to promote reading
*22:39.460- 22:41.020* :  and that's certainly something close
*22:41.020- 22:42.400* :  to Strasbourg's identity.
*22:42.960- 22:44.420* :  It claims to be the city
*22:44.420- 22:46.980* :  where the first ever newspaper was produced
*22:46.980- 22:48.660* :  back in 1609.
*22:49.420- 22:51.700* :  Lucy Atcherson asked the mayor of Strasbourg
*22:51.700- 22:55.000* :  Jean-Basseien what winning the title meant to her.
*22:55.720- 22:59.360* :  Oh, I must say it was a very powerful moment.
*22:59.360- 23:02.740* :  My colleagues and I were overjoyed
*23:03.180- 23:07.280* :  because Strasbourg becomes the first French city
*23:07.280- 23:12.320* :  to receive this label of a World Book Capital UNESCO.
*23:12.720- 23:14.020* :  Why is it so important to you
*23:14.020- 23:15.340* :  and to the city of Strasbourg?
*23:15.780- 23:19.640* :  Our city's Strasbourg has a very long history
*23:19.660- 23:21.040* :  with the books.
*23:21.240- 23:23.640* :  We are the city where the Gutenberg
*23:23.640- 23:28.740* :  inventing printing and so it is very important to us
*23:28.880- 23:32.540* :  because it means the history of our city
*23:32.600- 23:34.040* :  but it's also its future.
*23:34.580- 23:37.720* :  And we want to say with this label that with books
*23:37.720- 23:42.160* :  we can also promote debate, we can change the world.
*23:42.260- 23:45.360* :  And so it's also about the power of books.
*23:45.640- 23:47.260* :  What are you hoping it will mean for the city
*23:47.260- 23:49.320* :  in terms of long-term positive impact?
*23:49.320- 23:54.860* :  This label from UNESCO is about promoting books
*23:55.080- 23:58.640* :  and reading in all forms and for all ages
*23:59.400- 24:03.980* :  so to fight illiteracy and inequalities.
*24:04.840- 24:08.120* :  And so we also use the opportunity
*24:08.220- 24:13.180* :  to give new books a location in schools and nurseries
*24:13.760- 24:18.320* :  so that this amazing label could have a long-term impact.
*24:18.800- 24:21.020* :  Have you been inspired by other World Book Capitals?
*24:21.460- 24:23.760* :  Of course, most recently it was a cry in Ghana
*24:23.760- 24:25.100* :  who were awarded the title.
*24:25.500- 24:30.740* :  It is an international network of 25 cities.
*24:31.320- 24:35.380* :  We welcomed a big delegation from Accra,
*24:35.800- 24:38.360* :  the mayor of Accra is also a woman
*24:38.360- 24:42.380* :  and it was a really strong moment between us
*24:42.400- 24:47.300* :  as she gave me the flame of the World Book Capital
*24:47.780- 24:50.320* :  and of course what the other cities did
*24:50.320- 24:53.160* :  in the past was for us a big inspiration
*24:53.680- 24:57.540* :  and we will keep in touch and it's also a great partnership
*24:57.540- 25:01.500* :  to come with the next World Book Capital next year 2025.
*25:01.580- 25:03.560* :  It will be Rio de Janeiro.
*25:03.560- 25:08.460* :  They came also to Strasbourg and I can wait to go to Rio
*25:08.460- 25:11.820* :  to give the flame to the mayor of Rio next year.
*25:12.260- 25:14.340* :  Strasbourg mayor Jean-Basayan.
*25:15.080- 25:17.840* :  Now when you're away there's a good chance you'll have caught up
*25:17.840- 25:20.700* :  with family, friends or colleagues through a video call.
*25:20.700- 25:22.820* :  It's a much more personal way to connect
*25:23.380- 25:24.580* :  that a text or an email.
*25:25.240- 25:27.940* :  New research from the University of Glasgow in Scotland
*25:27.940- 25:30.260* :  suggests this isn't only true for people
*25:30.800- 25:32.380* :  as Anna Murphy's been finding out.
*25:36.960- 25:38.140* :  Hello, who's there?
*25:45.160- 25:46.440* :  Yes, you heard it correctly.
*25:46.960- 25:49.480* :  Those are the squarks of two parents talking to each other
*25:49.480- 25:50.520* :  via video call.
*25:51.000- 25:52.160* :  They're taking part in a study
*25:52.400- 25:54.460* :  into the way that animals could use the internet
*25:54.660- 25:56.780* :  to connect with one another, much like we do.
*25:57.780- 25:59.600* :  Now I'd love to play you some more of that video
*26:00.120- 26:01.320* :  and to tell you the parents' names
*26:01.640- 26:04.040* :  but we've been told we need to protect their anonymity.
*26:04.700- 26:08.040* :  The lead researcher of the study was Dr. Ilyena Hersky Douglas.
*26:08.500- 26:10.480* :  Initially we did a lot of research where we
*26:10.860- 26:13.760* :  connected parents together online through video calls
*26:13.760- 26:15.920* :  and we trained parents to use our video call system
*26:16.120- 26:18.480* :  and we found that all parents would use this video call system
*26:18.480- 26:20.620* :  but it was a lot of work for their owners.
*26:21.060- 26:22.260* :  You know, they had to set up the calls
*26:22.260- 26:24.140* :  and times the parent was busy in another call
*26:24.140- 26:25.720* :  all these different things that can go wrong.
*26:26.100- 26:26.440* :  Oh dear.
*26:26.700- 26:29.300* :  The classic problem of clashing parent social schedules
*26:29.920- 26:31.020* :  but Ilyena had an idea.
*26:31.480- 26:34.840* :  Then I thought it might be interesting to connect them to videos instead
*26:35.140- 26:36.160* :  because these are a lot easier.
*26:36.160- 26:37.680* :  You can just play these in the background
*26:37.680- 26:39.020* :  when the parent requested
*26:39.400- 26:40.740* :  and these can be used for a long time
*26:40.740- 26:42.940* :  so the other parents don't need to be available for instance
*26:43.680- 26:46.420* :  but we didn't know how they would perceive online calls.
*26:46.460- 26:48.280* :  Do they perceive them the same with the video?
*26:48.280- 26:49.960* :  Do they know another parent is live?
*26:50.320- 26:52.600* :  Well the findings suggest that yes they did know.
*26:53.120- 26:56.180* :  The nine parent participants seemed to prefer the live chance
*26:56.180- 26:58.860* :  as they spent far longer making video calls
*26:59.000- 27:01.000* :  than they did watching the pre-recorded ones.
*27:01.960- 27:03.320* :  Now the important thing to note here
*27:03.460- 27:04.900* :  is that it was the parent's choice.
*27:05.380- 27:06.920* :  They were trained to at least in part
*27:06.920- 27:09.000* :  being controlled of their own social lives.
*27:09.300- 27:11.280* :  We used a system where we gave them a bell
*27:11.600- 27:12.560* :  and when they rang the bell
*27:12.720- 27:14.480* :  then the owner would come over
*27:14.800- 27:15.700* :  present them with a tablet
*27:16.140- 27:17.800* :  and there was profile photos on the tablet
*27:17.800- 27:19.120* :  and the parent could use their tongue
*27:19.120- 27:21.120* :  to select the profile photo on the screen.
*27:21.120- 27:24.180* :  We did a lot of work around training them to use this system
*27:24.180- 27:26.540* :  and also we then did a stage of introductions.
*27:26.720- 27:27.900* :  We called it meet and greet
*27:28.320- 27:30.520* :  where each parent would meet each other online.
*27:31.040- 27:31.840* :  And as it turns out
*27:31.960- 27:33.440* :  the parents even formed friendships
*27:33.800- 27:34.600* :  and just like us
*27:34.800- 27:37.340* :  preferred calling some parent friends over others.
*27:38.120- 27:40.140* :  So it seems to have been an enjoyable experience
*27:40.140- 27:41.280* :  for these nine parents
*27:41.280- 27:43.700* :  but what about the wider benefits of this research?
*27:44.200- 27:45.200* :  For parents specifically
*27:45.200- 27:47.520* :  because they do live in these large flocks in the wild
*27:47.960- 27:49.100* :  but traditionally in homes
*27:49.120- 27:50.280* :  they live in much smaller groups
*27:50.980- 27:52.140* :  we're hoping that something like this
*27:52.140- 27:54.140* :  could potentially give them some social benefit.
*27:54.600- 27:56.300* :  And then if we start looking at this wider
*27:56.780- 27:58.440* :  we have lots of other animals that we keep
*27:58.460- 27:59.760* :  either in our homes,
*27:59.780- 28:02.160* :  whose aquariums or various different situations
*28:02.600- 28:04.620* :  which don't have access to the number of animals
*28:04.620- 28:05.540* :  that they would in the wild.
*28:05.540- 28:08.140* :  So I really see the animal internet
*28:08.140- 28:09.400* :  or animal video calls
*28:09.580- 28:11.940* :  is potentially expanding in animals world
*28:11.940- 28:13.660* :  much in the same way as expanded us.
*28:14.020- 28:15.720* :  Iliana told us that as well as chatting
*28:15.720- 28:17.220* :  the parents groomed, sang
*28:17.220- 28:18.420* :  and played with toys together
*28:18.420- 28:19.320* :  whilst on the calls
*28:19.840- 28:21.160* :  but there was one more question
*28:21.160- 28:22.360* :  I just had to ask.
*28:22.700- 28:23.820* :  What were they talking about?
*28:24.520- 28:25.400* :  Do you have any sense
*28:26.360- 28:27.460* :  they might have been discussing?
*28:28.320- 28:30.300* :  No it's something I would also like to
*28:30.300- 28:33.160* :  like to know what's the topic of a parent video call.
*28:33.560- 28:35.480* :  So for now what the parents were talking about
*28:36.000- 28:36.960* :  and who these parents were
*28:37.480- 28:38.640* :  will have to remain a mystery.
*28:39.280- 28:41.220* :  I suppose we're all entitled to our privacy.
*28:41.920- 28:42.560* :  Anna Murphy
*28:43.100- 28:44.220* :  Now we'd love to hear from you
*28:44.220- 28:46.920* :  if you have any pets who'd like to do video calls.
*28:51.980- 28:53.160* :  And that's all from us for now.
