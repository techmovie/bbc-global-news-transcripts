*01:22.540- 01:24.700* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:24.840- 01:29.040* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Monday the 6th of May.
*01:29.640- 01:33.520* :  Al Jazeera accuses Israel of trying to suppress the truth about the war in Gaza
*01:33.520- 01:35.340* :  by shutting down its operations.
*01:35.360- 01:39.900* :  Meanwhile, three Israeli soldiers have been killed in a Hamas rocket attack.
*01:40.820- 01:43.640* :  And as orthodox Christians celebrate Easter festivities are overshadowed
*01:44.720- 01:46.140* :  by the Ukraine-Russia war.
*01:49.060- 01:49.720* :  Also in the podcast.
*01:50.360- 01:53.480* :  If you start losing things like that, then everything goes down hill, isn't it?
*01:54.140- 01:59.160* :  It is English language, and science should contain proper language.
*02:00.000- 02:03.780* :  The roul brewing in northern England over punctuation on road signs.
*02:08.920- 02:13.820* :  Since the Israel Hamas war began last year, Al Jazeera has been broadcasting images
*02:13.820- 02:16.780* :  of the death and destruction from inside Gaza.
*02:17.440- 02:19.420* :  Some of its journalists have even been killed there.
*02:19.420- 02:23.820* :  The Israeli government has long accused the Katari-based network of being biased,
*02:23.820- 02:26.820* :  and has now shut its operations in Israel.
*02:27.260- 02:31.300* :  Police raided the Al Jazeera office in Jerusalem and confiscated equipment,
*02:31.300- 02:34.080* :  also cutting satellites and cable transmissions.
*02:34.080- 02:39.640* :  The broadcast says the shutdown is a criminal action aimed at concealing the truth of the war in Gaza.
*02:40.180- 02:44.260* :  Mohammed Mohawad is the managing editor of Al Jazeera's Arabic channel.
*02:44.560- 02:48.200* :  We believe this is an attack on a press freedom.
*02:48.200- 02:55.000* :  It is a way of trying to deter Al Jazeera, trying to block our coverage from inside Israel.
*02:55.600- 03:00.320* :  Well, the shutdown was also criticized by former Israeli consul general Alon Pincas.
*03:00.860- 03:08.660* :  Al Jazeera is based in Doha Katar, and Katar is playing a pivotal and central and important role
*03:09.120- 03:10.820* :  in the hostage negotiations.
*03:11.740- 03:17.940* :  So, even if Israel has justified grievances and resentments and anger and disappointments
*03:18.540- 03:21.800* :  with Al Jazeera's reporting, the timing is horrible.
*03:22.600- 03:26.360* :  And, practically, it's not going to prevent Al Jazeera from reporting.
*03:26.360- 03:28.400* :  It's just going to make their lives more difficult.
*03:29.160- 03:33.340* :  I heard more about Israel's actions against Al Jazeera from our Middle East analyst,
*03:33.480- 03:34.320* :  Sebastian Asher.
*03:34.640- 03:37.220* :  Something that's been building up for a long time in Israel,
*03:37.220- 03:42.480* :  the sort of Israeli distaste amongst the authorities for our Jazeera dates back years.
*03:43.180- 03:48.320* :  But, as with many things, what's happened since October the 7th has intensified that,
*03:48.320- 03:54.340* :  and we saw preparation for a law that was then approved by the Israeli Parliament back in April,
*03:54.340- 03:59.320* :  which would give the government the right, the ability to shut it down essentially.
*03:59.320- 04:02.980* :  It was not directly saying that it was Al Jazeera,
*04:02.980- 04:07.180* :  but any foreign media outlet that threatens national security,
*04:07.180- 04:10.360* :  and mad essentially, is what the Israelis are saying.
*04:10.360- 04:14.580* :  The communication minister has issued a couple of statements in which he said that overtly.
*04:14.900- 04:19.100* :  I think the fact that it's being built up to reveals itself in the speed
*04:19.100- 04:22.600* :  with which it's happened since the announcement was made earlier.
*04:23.000- 04:27.120* :  Today, there was a raid on the officers of Al Jazeera and Jerusalem.
*04:27.340- 04:28.360* :  That's been closed down.
*04:28.900- 04:31.160* :  Equipment, broadcast equipment has been confiscated,
*04:31.160- 04:34.340* :  including mobile phones of reporters, laptops, etc.
*04:34.900- 04:41.140* :  And the satellite and cable providers on which the platforms on which Al Jazeera was appearing,
*04:41.480- 04:43.320* :  they've also blocked it now and the website.
*04:43.320- 04:46.900* :  So, this has gone into action very, very quickly,
*04:47.340- 04:53.700* :  and it shows how the Israeli government at least believes that what Al Jazeera
*04:54.040- 04:56.740* :  represents is a kind of propaganda mouthpiece for Hamas.
*04:56.940- 04:58.260* :  Yeah, it says that accusation.
*04:58.400- 04:59.240* :  It says it's biased.
*04:59.240- 05:00.480* :  I mean, is that true?
*05:00.480- 05:05.280* :  And if not, what impact does Al Jazeera's reporting from inside Gaza have
*05:05.640- 05:06.840* :  on opinion in the Arab world?
*05:07.080- 05:11.640* :  I mean, Al Jazeera certainly takes a position much more squarely and clearly
*05:11.640- 05:16.920* :  than, say, the BBC does, or CNN does, or a lot of other international media outlets.
*05:17.420- 05:20.500* :  When you watch it, and this has been clear from English language
*05:21.080- 05:23.980* :  as much as the Arabic editions recently,
*05:23.980- 05:29.560* :  again, since October the 7th, is that it is very much prioritising
*05:30.060- 05:32.640* :  the voices of a Palestinian to pro-Palestinians,
*05:33.180- 05:39.520* :  and Hamas spokespeople do get to essentially have their press conferences
*05:39.980- 05:41.100* :  given in full alive.
*05:41.100- 05:43.720* :  Now, Al Jazeera would say it's simply doing its job
*05:43.720- 05:46.960* :  that this is not about balance in this case.
*05:46.960- 05:50.180* :  This tells you what the story is, what's happening in Gaza,
*05:50.760- 05:53.040* :  the casualties that Palestinian people are suffering,
*05:53.040- 05:56.000* :  the destruction, etc., to them, that's for story,
*05:56.380- 06:00.500* :  and that other media outlets are not telling the story to the same extent as them.
*06:00.500- 06:03.940* :  So that is their defence to justify what they do.
*06:04.280- 06:08.640* :  You could save it within that, and certainly in its Arabic side for a long time,
*06:08.940- 06:11.080* :  some of the language used, talking about martyrs,
*06:11.080- 06:14.400* :  talking about resistance, etc., would not be acceptable
*06:14.900- 06:16.820* :  on international media organisations,
*06:16.820- 06:19.500* :  which try to seem as balanced as possible.
*06:19.980- 06:22.660* :  Sebastian Asha, meanwhile the Israeli military,
*06:22.660- 06:25.820* :  has closed one of the few routes allowing aid into Gaza
*06:26.320- 06:29.200* :  after Hamas fired rockets towards the Kerem Shalom crossing.
*06:29.720- 06:33.000* :  The Palestinian group claimed it was targeting an Israeli army base
*06:33.440- 06:35.080* :  from Jerusalem, Frank Gardner reports.
*06:37.420- 06:39.560* :  Down on the Gaza border close to Rafa,
*06:39.560- 06:41.900* :  a deadly rocket attack by Hamas,
*06:42.460- 06:46.960* :  on the very crossing point through which it was hoped more aid could flow into the territory.
*06:47.740- 06:48.720* :  It's since been shot.
*06:49.400- 06:51.400* :  At least three Israeli soldiers were killed.
*06:53.740- 06:57.860* :  Today, Israel's and battle prime minister reacted to Hamas's demands
*06:58.420- 06:59.640* :  for a permanent cease-fire,
*06:59.940- 07:01.920* :  and an in-israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
*07:02.760- 07:05.060* :  The state of Israel is not willing to accept this,
*07:05.060- 07:07.680* :  he said, capitulating to Hamas's demands
*07:07.680- 07:09.880* :  would be a terrible defeat for Israel.
*07:12.380- 07:15.740* :  But the government here is under pressure from parts of its own population.
*07:16.440- 07:19.480* :  Last night, tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in protest
*07:19.480- 07:22.400* :  at delays in getting the hostages out of Gaza.
*07:23.100- 07:25.740* :  They don't believe the government is making it a priority.
*07:26.700- 07:29.140* :  The Israeli government wants its hostages out,
*07:29.440- 07:32.080* :  but at the same time, it's vowed to destroy Hamas,
*07:32.360- 07:34.520* :  which is why it won't agree to a permanent cease-fire.
*07:35.180- 07:37.480* :  But Hamas, which holds the hostages,
*07:37.900- 07:42.060* :  says it won't sign a deal unless the cease-fire is permanent,
*07:42.560- 07:44.760* :  which is why the peace talks have stalled.
*07:45.900- 07:50.000* :  A delegation from Hamas has just been in Cairo talking to mediators.
*07:50.180- 07:52.680* :  They've now left to consult with their leadership.
*07:54.400- 07:58.400* :  In Gaza, the war continues with airstrikes and deprivation.
*08:00.040- 08:02.360* :  Gaza's are desperate for this war to end,
*08:03.060- 08:04.400* :  so too are many Israelis.
*08:05.320- 08:08.220* :  But others in Israel see this as unfinished business.
*08:08.960- 08:12.620* :  They want this war pursued until Hamas is utterly destroyed.
*08:14.840- 08:16.420* :  Frank Gardner in Jerusalem,
*08:16.480- 08:18.880* :  well, as we heard, the families of hostages
*08:18.880- 08:21.720* :  want Israel to do more to get the captives out.
*08:22.420- 08:23.520* :  Michael Levy's younger brother,
*08:23.520- 08:25.340* :  Orr, was one of the many Israelis taken
*08:25.340- 08:28.300* :  from the Nova Music Festival on the 7th of October.
*08:28.900- 08:31.280* :  Orr's wife, A nav, was murdered at the scene.
*08:31.280- 08:34.840* :  Michael told the BBC that life feels frozen in time.
*08:35.240- 08:38.500* :  Everything feels like one very long and very bad day.
*08:38.820- 08:43.160* :  They didn't change the feeling that we are still living on October 7th.
*08:43.380- 08:44.600* :  It's affecting everyone.
*08:45.060- 08:46.320* :  It's affecting me personally.
*08:46.320- 08:51.460* :  My parents, my brother's son is two and a half years old
*08:51.520- 08:54.140* :  and he feels different.
*08:54.140- 08:58.960* :  I mean, he sees parents coming to take their kids on his kindergarten
*08:58.960- 09:04.020* :  and he cries that his father and his mother are not coming.
*09:04.800- 09:05.680* :  Michael Levy.
*09:06.540- 09:07.280* :  Other news now.
*09:07.280- 09:11.480* :  Brazil's president has vowed to help the state of Rio Grande do Sul rebuild
*09:11.480- 09:15.000* :  after widespread destruction from flooding and landslides.
*09:15.440- 09:19.380* :  The number of dead there has risen to at least 75, while dozens more are missing.
*09:19.940- 09:21.660* :  After more than a week of torrential rain,
*09:21.660- 09:24.400* :  rivers have burst their banks and a dam has collapsed.
*09:24.400- 09:28.840* :  People are stranded on roofs and many streets are only navigable by boat.
*09:28.840- 09:32.440* :  President Luis Inacio Lula to silver spoke on a visit to the scene.
*09:35.180- 09:38.420* :  I know that we have many state roads that are in need of repair.
*09:39.520- 09:40.800* :  I want to tell you that I'm not worried,
*09:41.200- 09:43.660* :  because the federal government will help you to rebuild them.
*09:44.580- 09:46.140* :  We also need to rebuild a lot of houses,
*09:46.600- 09:50.720* :  and mayors need to take into account the fact that we cannot put them back on the same land.
*09:51.780- 09:54.460* :  Authorities need to locate safe locations for new homes.
*09:55.100- 09:59.480* :  Well, almost 90,000 people have been displaced since the storms began last Saturday,
*10:00.080- 10:02.960* :  including Laura Carvello and her eight-year-old son.
*10:03.200- 10:08.700* :  Now I'm in Cachoe de Nia with my in-laws and my boyfriend leaves in the city
*10:09.140- 10:12.980* :  and the Guayba River has taken over almost everything,
*10:13.500- 10:17.000* :  including the city bus station, the scenarios devastating.
*10:17.000- 10:20.960* :  Other cities too are suffering with this all over the state,
*10:21.560- 10:24.440* :  in Canoas in a city near Portolegri.
*10:24.740- 10:28.120* :  There have been many deaths and 100 people missing.
*10:28.640- 10:30.760* :  My house is now filled with water.
*10:31.220- 10:32.500* :  We lost everything.
*10:32.500- 10:36.420* :  I'm sorry, I just trying to speak at my best,
*10:36.500- 10:40.680* :  but we lost everything we had, years of work.
*10:41.140- 10:46.160* :  I just took my son and our two cats and I feel clothes,
*10:46.900- 10:48.940* :  and now everything's lost.
*10:49.700- 10:55.920* :  Some people just left just with their clothes, their bodies, and nothing.
*10:56.420- 10:58.340* :  They all tore it in our street.
*10:58.920- 11:01.220* :  They just told us, please, leave.
*11:01.740- 11:03.720* :  Take everything you can and leave,
*11:03.720- 11:08.800* :  because we can do much anymore, and some people stay there,
*11:09.180- 11:09.880* :  like my neighbors.
*11:10.160- 11:12.700* :  They are waiting for rescue with boats.
*11:13.120- 11:16.340* :  We are going to need help in our, sorry,
*11:16.980- 11:19.600* :  trying not to cry all those cities,
*11:19.700- 11:21.220* :  and our state will need help,
*11:21.480- 11:23.860* :  because there's a lot of missing people,
*11:24.020- 11:27.380* :  and that's, I have no words.
*11:28.380- 11:30.660* :  Nara Kavayo in southern Brazil.
*11:31.620- 11:35.900* :  On Sunday, both Ukraine and Russia celebrated the orthodox Christian Easter,
*11:36.420- 11:39.020* :  but that didn't stop Russian attacks on Eastern Ukraine.
*11:39.020- 11:41.680* :  Ukrainian officials said three people had been killed,
*11:41.680- 11:43.140* :  and at least a dozen wounded.
*11:43.140- 11:46.660* :  President Putin attended an Easter service in Moscow,
*11:46.660- 11:48.900* :  led by the head of the Russian orthodox church,
*11:48.900- 11:52.360* :  Petriot Kirill, who's known for his strong backing for the war.
*11:52.880- 11:54.440* :  For his part, the Ukrainian President,
*11:54.440- 11:57.540* :  Volodymyr Zelensky, delivered a defiant message recorded
*11:57.540- 11:59.400* :  at St. Sophia Cathedral, in Kiev.
*12:03.960- 12:06.660* :  Today, we all believe in a new victory for Ukraine,
*12:06.660- 12:10.980* :  and we are all sure that no horde and no evil will destroy us.
*12:11.380- 12:12.820* :  We are overcoming dark times,
*12:12.820- 12:16.000* :  and on this bright day, I, like most of us,
*12:16.360- 12:17.640* :  am not wearing bright clothes,
*12:17.640- 12:20.240* :  but we are fighting for a bright idea.
*12:20.840- 12:23.760* :  Valerie Sarnasin heard more about President Zelensky's speech
*12:23.760- 12:25.720* :  from our Europe editor, Denis Eberhardt.
*12:25.880- 12:27.960* :  He basically spoke on a number of themes,
*12:27.960- 12:29.540* :  one of which was liberation.
*12:29.580- 12:33.700* :  The idea that Easter symbolizes the liberation of the human soul
*12:33.700- 12:36.900* :  from the slavery of evil and darkness was his quote.
*12:37.400- 12:38.560* :  Another one was resistance.
*12:38.620- 12:42.620* :  He spoke of having resisted the evil of the Russian invasion,
*12:42.660- 12:43.360* :  as he put it.
*12:43.880- 12:45.240* :  Another one was perseverance.
*12:45.240- 12:47.660* :  He acknowledged that Ukrainian cities and villages
*12:48.260- 12:50.440* :  were exhausted by suffering, as he said.
*12:50.820- 12:53.380* :  But he said that these could be overcome by faith.
*12:53.380- 12:57.940* :  The last message he put it very strongly was that God was with Ukraine.
*12:58.540- 13:00.000* :  He said that basically,
*13:00.000- 13:02.740* :  President Putin had broken all the commandments,
*13:02.900- 13:05.080* :  for example, to love thy neighbor.
*13:05.560- 13:06.760* :  And God knew that.
*13:06.760- 13:11.500* :  He said God has a chevron with a Ukrainian flag on his shoulder.
*13:12.120- 13:14.360* :  Whereas President Putin, very different,
*13:14.400- 13:17.420* :  he attended the ceremony in Christ the Savior,
*13:17.800- 13:18.820* :  Cathedral in Moscow,
*13:19.400- 13:21.540* :  wearing matching suits with Moscow's mayor.
*13:22.000- 13:24.500* :  And then in addressing the Kremlin website,
*13:24.500- 13:27.500* :  he spoke of a very little of the war directly.
*13:27.560- 13:30.040* :  He said that in the face of serious challenges,
*13:30.540- 13:33.120* :  Christian religious organizations provide effective,
*13:33.560- 13:35.880* :  selfless assistance to those who need support.
*13:35.880- 13:40.120* :  I imagine by that he was thinking of the people who died in the war.
*13:40.580- 13:43.440* :  And he also sent congratulations to Patrick Kirill
*13:43.700- 13:46.280* :  for his efforts to strengthen the Fatherland.
*13:46.280- 13:47.660* :  Patrick Kirill, as you mentioned,
*13:47.660- 13:50.780* :  extremely patriotic and very much on board
*13:50.780- 13:52.000* :  with the invasion of Ukraine.
*13:52.380- 13:54.780* :  It's tell us about the importance of religion,
*13:55.220- 13:57.460* :  particularly the Orthodox religion in these two countries.
*13:58.140- 13:59.860* :  It is a point of contention, isn't it,
*14:00.080- 14:01.020* :  between Russia and Ukraine?
*14:01.540- 14:05.580* :  There's been a very divisive issue over recent years.
*14:05.580- 14:07.560* :  So basically, for a long time,
*14:07.560- 14:10.780* :  Ukraine was beneath the Moscow Patriarchate
*14:10.820- 14:12.520* :  of the Russian Orthodox Church.
*14:13.020- 14:16.800* :  And since 2019, it had its own church,
*14:16.800- 14:19.220* :  an autosephalus Orthodox church,
*14:19.220- 14:20.580* :  recognized in Ukraine.
*14:21.220- 14:23.360* :  But that coexist with a schism.
*14:23.500- 14:26.440* :  So the Orthodox church of Ukraine,
*14:26.440- 14:28.540* :  which is the new body,
*14:28.880- 14:31.720* :  split from a thing called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,
*14:31.720- 14:32.560* :  very similarly named.
*14:32.560- 14:34.540* :  It used to be, have a suffix,
*14:34.560- 14:35.960* :  the Moscow Patriarchate.
*14:35.960- 14:39.100* :  It's dropped that since the invasion of Ukraine
*14:39.100- 14:40.760* :  by Russia, the full scale invasion.
*14:41.200- 14:42.780* :  And it says it's split from that.
*14:42.780- 14:45.160* :  But the Ukrainian authorities don't believe that.
*14:45.160- 14:47.540* :  They say that that church that co-exist
*14:48.360- 14:49.940* :  is full of Russian collaborators.
*14:50.540- 14:52.060* :  And that's a very divisive issue.
*14:52.060- 14:55.160* :  Russia says that actually that church is being persecuted
*14:55.160- 14:58.120* :  and used that to justify their invasion of Ukraine
*14:58.120- 14:59.020* :  after the fact.
*14:59.340- 15:01.500* :  A Europe editor, Danny Eberhard.
*15:01.800- 15:03.980* :  After more than 800 days of fighting,
*15:03.980- 15:07.080* :  both Ukraine and Russia are looking at how to replace
*15:07.080- 15:08.760* :  the many troops killed in battle.
*15:09.260- 15:10.300* :  While the Ukrainian government
*15:10.300- 15:11.980* :  has lowered the age of conscription,
*15:12.360- 15:15.160* :  Russia is looking further afield for its manpower.
*15:15.340- 15:17.680* :  Research by the BBC has found the Russian army
*15:17.680- 15:20.940* :  is recruiting Cubans to make up the shortfall in its soldiers.
*15:21.640- 15:24.340* :  Vitaly Shevchenko from BBC Monitoring has this report.
*15:28.820- 15:32.520* :  Soldiers from the Caribbean island of Cuba dancing
*15:32.520- 15:35.800* :  with Russian soldiers are usually a rare sight.
*15:36.460- 15:38.760* :  But videos like this have started to appear
*15:38.760- 15:41.380* :  on social media after numerous Cubans
*15:41.660- 15:43.300* :  have joined the Russian army.
*15:43.780- 15:45.780* :  The BBC has confirmed their identities
*15:45.780- 15:48.460* :  of dozens of Cuban men who are reported
*15:48.460- 15:50.120* :  to have enlisted recently.
*15:50.560- 15:53.420* :  While leaked documents and media reports suggest
*15:53.420- 15:55.760* :  that their number could be in the hundreds.
*15:56.280- 15:59.260* :  More than 200 IDs belonging to Cubans
*15:59.260- 16:01.360* :  who allegedly joined the Russian army
*16:01.700- 16:02.840* :  have been leaked online.
*16:02.980- 16:05.540* :  The BBC has matched 31 of them
*16:05.600- 16:08.660* :  with Facebook accounts posting content from Russia
*16:09.040- 16:11.020* :  or saying they're based in Russia.
*16:11.660- 16:13.140* :  Some of them show Cuban men
*16:13.440- 16:15.200* :  in Russian military uniforms.
*16:15.800- 16:18.820* :  They are attracted by the promise of lavish payments
*16:18.820- 16:21.300* :  and offers of Russian citizenship.
*16:21.300- 16:22.880* :  Here's Lathara Gonzalez,
*16:23.540- 16:24.980* :  an officer has been interviewed
*16:25.040- 16:27.180* :  by the Cuban opposition station,
*16:27.180- 16:28.320* :  America Radio.
*16:32.360- 16:35.040* :  I signed up, I spent for my own benefit
*16:35.600- 16:36.720* :  as for that of my family.
*16:37.320- 16:39.000* :  And in addition, all my life,
*16:39.000- 16:40.740* :  I've always been part of the military.
*16:41.000- 16:43.640* :  I am here as the head of the company of troops
*16:43.960- 16:46.020* :  leading all the Cubans of the current time
*16:46.400- 16:48.980* :  and in my command, we're talking about 90 soldiers.
*16:49.540- 16:52.440* :  But not all of the Cubans signing up to go to Russia
*16:52.960- 16:55.340* :  seem to have been aware of the real nature
*16:55.340- 16:56.680* :  of the job and offer.
*17:01.680- 17:02.980* :  They told us it was for construction,
*17:03.340- 17:05.760* :  to repair the houses devastated by the wall,
*17:05.760- 17:08.240* :  to dig trenches, to clear debris,
*17:08.240- 17:10.020* :  and in the end, it's all a swindle.
*17:10.260- 17:12.680* :  Cubans are not the only foreign fighters
*17:12.680- 17:14.080* :  recruited by Russia.
*17:14.680- 17:16.760* :  Ukraine says it has seen an increase
*17:16.760- 17:18.140* :  in the number of foreign fighters
*17:18.440- 17:20.240* :  joining Russian forces in recent months
*17:20.700- 17:22.080* :  as well as the number of foreigners
*17:22.480- 17:23.840* :  captured on the battlefield.
*17:24.560- 17:27.480* :  But Roy Attenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's agency
*17:27.480- 17:29.760* :  for prisoners of war, told the BBC
*17:30.300- 17:32.100* :  that many of them originate from countries
*17:32.340- 17:34.100* :  such as Cuba, India, Nepal,
*17:34.880- 17:36.700* :  African and Central Asian states.
*17:36.960- 17:40.860* :  We have an increasing number of foreign mercenaries
*17:41.020- 17:45.040* :  and the Ukrainian fighters caught a lot of foreigners
*17:45.040- 17:48.680* :  on the frontline during the last period of time.
*17:48.800- 17:50.240* :  I'm in a couple of months.
*17:50.780- 17:55.700* :  A lot of them are originated from the so-called
*17:55.980- 17:57.240* :  global sauce.
*17:57.860- 17:59.820* :  In general, this country's
*18:00.420- 18:02.840* :  always very low personnel income.
*18:03.400- 18:05.860* :  Every day, every week, we have
*18:06.380- 18:09.440* :  like one, two, three, up to five persons
*18:10.080- 18:11.380* :  from foreign countries.
*18:11.380- 18:13.580* :  I mean, from the mercenaries,
*18:13.900- 18:16.360* :  we are capturing on the frontline
*18:16.360- 18:17.580* :  as prisoners of war.
*18:17.880- 18:20.960* :  Mr. Attenko says they aren't very good soldiers
*18:21.280- 18:23.700* :  and their life expectancy in the battlefield
*18:23.740- 18:26.380* :  is not even days but hours.
*18:26.940- 18:29.960* :  However, this war is a numbers game right now
*18:30.360- 18:33.720* :  in which Ukraine is held gunned and held manned.

*19:11.100- 19:12.980* :  offer flexible budget-friendly coverage
*19:12.980- 19:15.080* :  that lasts nearly three years in some states.

*19:53.040- 19:54.620* :  An Australian whistleblower,
*19:54.620- 19:57.340* :  who exposed allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan,
*19:57.340- 19:59.800* :  is due to be sentenced over the next two days
*19:59.800- 20:01.700* :  for leaking classified information.
*20:02.360- 20:04.620* :  Former Australian Army lawyer David McBride
*20:04.620- 20:06.760* :  has admitted passing files to a journalist
*20:06.760- 20:09.220* :  at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
*20:09.700- 20:11.200* :  which then ran a series of reports
*20:11.200- 20:13.900* :  on the operations of the Australian Special Forces.
*20:14.600- 20:16.520* :  A landmark inquiry later found evidence
*20:16.520- 20:20.580* :  that Australian forces had unlawfully killed 39 Afghans.
*20:21.060- 20:23.520* :  Mr McBride could be sent to jail for a decade.
*20:24.100- 20:26.300* :  The BBC's Rebecca Kesby asked him
*20:26.300- 20:28.080* :  why he leaked the documents.
*20:28.600- 20:32.340* :  I believed our government were covering up war crimes.
*20:32.500- 20:35.600* :  They were also doing sham prosecutions
*20:35.660- 20:37.460* :  and people that hadn't done anything wrong
*20:37.820- 20:41.420* :  to draw attention away from many years of serious war crimes.
*20:41.560- 20:43.000* :  It had got so bad,
*20:43.000- 20:45.440* :  we were becoming a parody of ourselves.
*20:45.940- 20:46.840* :  Something needed to be done,
*20:46.840- 20:48.640* :  not even so much about the Afghan War,
*20:48.640- 20:50.840* :  but if we didn't improve the situation,
*20:51.260- 20:53.620* :  but the coming wars where the leadership
*20:53.620- 20:57.040* :  no longer cared for the truth or for the law.
*20:57.480- 21:01.200* :  Awarding medals was something which gave the ministers
*21:01.200- 21:02.740* :  a boost in the popularity,
*21:02.800- 21:06.140* :  and we gave out quite a few medals for extreme bravery.
*21:06.480- 21:09.740* :  And they didn't look too much at the heroes.
*21:10.720- 21:15.220* :  Now it looked like we knew certain famous soldiers
*21:15.580- 21:17.620* :  were committing war crimes with impunity.
*21:17.960- 21:20.460* :  Then we needed to get some scapegoats
*21:20.460- 21:22.560* :  and we actually tried to put some people in jail
*21:22.580- 21:24.180* :  who'd just done their job.
*21:24.180- 21:26.560* :  And I found that just reprehensible.
*21:26.880- 21:28.740* :  You were pointing at a culture
*21:28.740- 21:31.540* :  within the Australian SAS, the Special Forces.
*21:31.860- 21:33.080* :  What were you worried about there?
*21:33.340- 21:35.020* :  There was a culture of deceit,
*21:35.180- 21:36.240* :  just shoot someone,
*21:36.240- 21:37.460* :  often civilians,
*21:37.540- 21:41.080* :  and then take a photo of them holding a weapon
*21:41.080- 21:42.700* :  which you've pulled out of your bag.
*21:43.000- 21:44.340* :  A small amount of people were doing that,
*21:44.340- 21:46.280* :  but a lot of people knew about it.
*21:46.660- 21:48.740* :  Some of the leaders also knew about it,
*21:48.840- 21:49.980* :  and seem to encourage it.
*21:49.980- 21:52.460* :  Sometimes, for example, in one famous case,
*21:52.680- 21:55.200* :  they say a soldier shot an unarmed boy,
*21:55.460- 21:57.920* :  and then when he was written up for bravery medal,
*21:57.920- 22:01.720* :  the leadership brought him up as fighting off a Taliban force.
*22:02.380- 22:03.960* :  It wasn't just bad soldiers,
*22:04.200- 22:06.860* :  they were bad people enabling it at the top.
*22:07.160- 22:09.200* :  And when it started to come unstuck,
*22:09.280- 22:11.880* :  it's in a very cynical PR exercise.
*22:11.880- 22:14.860* :  They wanted to arrest and charge people,
*22:14.860- 22:17.620* :  but they didn't necessarily arrest and charge the right people.
*22:17.740- 22:20.680* :  And there's a military lawyer that really concerned me.
*22:20.960- 22:23.020* :  We were no longer the good guys in the world.
*22:23.060- 22:24.820* :  We were just as bad as our enemies,
*22:25.300- 22:26.740* :  completely ignoring the law,
*22:26.980- 22:28.360* :  and I just couldn't stand for that.
*22:28.780- 22:30.040* :  You've got a lot of supporters.
*22:30.040- 22:32.140* :  You've also got a lot of critics,
*22:32.140- 22:36.140* :  people who say that you've sold out military personnel,
*22:36.140- 22:38.740* :  you've endangered lives even.
*22:39.240- 22:40.580* :  What's your response to that,
*22:40.620- 22:41.860* :  and do you have any regrets?
*22:42.440- 22:43.540* :  I quite often ask that question,
*22:43.540- 22:44.820* :  and I'm always glad to answer it,
*22:44.820- 22:46.920* :  because it is hard facing J.O.
*22:46.920- 22:48.840* :  and I spent 10 years in this fight.
*22:48.900- 22:50.460* :  And every time I'm asked that I say,
*22:50.460- 22:52.360* :  no, look, I'm very proud of what I've done.
*22:52.880- 22:54.460* :  One of the good things about my case tomorrow
*22:54.460- 22:56.020* :  is the fact that even the prosecution
*22:56.080- 22:58.240* :  accept the fact that there was no danger
*22:58.240- 22:59.320* :  to national security.
*22:59.640- 23:02.020* :  I took the documents to some trusted journalists
*23:02.480- 23:03.680* :  who work in that area.
*23:04.160- 23:05.460* :  No one else has seen them.
*23:05.740- 23:07.920* :  And sometimes you don't follow orders
*23:07.920- 23:09.500* :  because the orders can be raw.
*23:10.060- 23:11.020* :  So no regrets.
*23:11.520- 23:13.580* :  Plenty of haters, but a lot more fans.
*23:13.820- 23:16.200* :  And I get stopped in the street every day.
*23:16.200- 23:17.880* :  People say, I'm so proud of you.
*23:17.880- 23:20.660* :  It's fantastic, and you make me proud of being Australian.
*23:20.660- 23:21.700* :  It keeps me going.
*23:22.160- 23:24.220* :  David McBride, talking to Rebecca Kasby.
*23:25.040- 23:27.200* :  The final of the Eurovision song contest
*23:27.200- 23:28.740* :  may still be six days away,
*23:28.740- 23:30.340* :  but events have already begun
*23:30.340- 23:32.140* :  in the Swedish host city of Malmö.
*23:32.640- 23:33.860* :  Artists have been parading
*23:33.860- 23:35.340* :  along the turquoise carpet
*23:35.340- 23:36.640* :  at the opening ceremony.
*23:37.240- 23:37.700* :  Oh my gosh.
*23:37.720- 23:38.820* :  I'm just having the best time.
*23:38.820- 23:40.460* :  I don't know if people just...
*23:40.500- 23:42.140* :  Eurovision is like the most incredible,
*23:42.680- 23:45.540* :  like, wonderfully chaotic circus, maybe.
*23:45.820- 23:46.060* :  Yeah.
*23:46.180- 23:47.520* :  See, like, the Olympics of music.
*23:47.520- 23:49.640* :  It's just there's so many amazing artists here.
*23:50.140- 23:51.280* :  It's just so brilliant to meet everyone.
*23:51.320- 23:52.060* :  It's so exciting.
*23:52.060- 23:53.260* :  The atmosphere, so yeah, that's great.
*23:53.820- 23:55.660* :  The UK entry, Oli Alexander.
*23:56.400- 23:58.620* :  The Israeli delegation didn't take part
*23:58.620- 23:59.760* :  in the opening ceremony
*23:59.760- 24:02.560* :  because it coincided with Holocaust Memorial Day.
*24:03.060- 24:04.920* :  But Israel's participation in the contest
*24:04.920- 24:07.580* :  as a whole has sparked anger from some
*24:07.580- 24:09.920* :  who say it should be banned because of the war in Gaza.
*24:10.380- 24:12.100* :  I spoke to David Rasmussen, a reporter
*24:12.100- 24:13.700* :  at Swedish Radio in Malmö.
*24:14.060- 24:15.560* :  He told me about the demonstrations
*24:15.560- 24:17.100* :  expected later in the week.
*24:17.460- 24:20.460* :  I think the main day to look after is Thursday
*24:21.020- 24:24.620* :  when the Israeli is going to have their semi-final.
*24:25.060- 24:26.480* :  There's going to be big protests
*24:26.860- 24:28.760* :  in the central areas of Malmö,
*24:29.140- 24:30.960* :  both a pro-Palestinian protest
*24:30.960- 24:35.200* :  and also a pro-Israeli protest on Thursday.
*24:35.760- 24:38.840* :  So I think Thursday is the day to watch out for.
*24:39.240- 24:42.820* :  And if Israel should proceed to the final on Saturday,
*24:43.420- 24:46.500* :  then that could also be a large protest.
*24:47.000- 24:48.200* :  Do we know what kind of measures
*24:48.460- 24:50.100* :  the police are planning to take?
*24:50.960- 24:53.780* :  Well, I was walking around downtown Malmö
*24:53.920- 24:57.800* :  and there is a massive police presence in Malmö.
*24:57.800- 25:00.820* :  There's police coming from other parts of Sweden.
*25:01.380- 25:03.600* :  So they're very visible in downtown
*25:03.600- 25:07.280* :  and at the Eurovision village that's in a park
*25:07.280- 25:09.820* :  and not far from where I'm sitting right now.
*25:10.240- 25:13.220* :  So there's lots of police, lots of security measures.
*25:13.220- 25:15.440* :  You're not allowed to bring handbags,
*25:15.440- 25:17.080* :  for example, into the parks.
*25:17.580- 25:21.360* :  So you really feel that there is a lot of security measures
*25:21.680- 25:22.400* :  in Malmö right now.
*25:22.620- 25:25.980* :  Yeah, I guess that happens for any big event of this kind.
*25:26.000- 25:28.360* :  But what's the feeling like in Malmö?
*25:28.360- 25:30.360* :  Is it excitement, tension, a bit of both?
*25:31.580- 25:32.940* :  I think it's more tension.
*25:32.940- 25:37.660* :  We were hosting here in Malmö in 2013
*25:38.380- 25:40.040* :  and that was more of a, you know,
*25:40.040- 25:42.260* :  that crazy Eurovision vibe.
*25:42.860- 25:47.380* :  This time around, it's more tension than party, really.
*25:47.840- 25:50.280* :  As I said, there's a lot of security everywhere.
*25:50.920- 25:53.540* :  Maybe there's not much room for parting, really.
*25:53.880- 25:57.560* :  Yeah, I mean, are people there used to this kind of event
*25:57.560- 25:59.520* :  taking place if you've already hosted it?
*25:59.520- 26:01.780* :  Are they just taking it in their stride people in the city?
*26:02.520- 26:04.860* :  The local paper did an opinion poll.
*26:04.960- 26:06.600* :  And there's a lot of people
*26:06.600- 26:09.340* :  that's going to change their patterns these coming days
*26:09.660- 26:14.580* :  and maybe not go to work near an Eurovision event
*26:14.640- 26:18.140* :  or some people are saying they're going to leave the city
*26:18.140- 26:19.740* :  during this event.
*26:20.000- 26:22.660* :  There's not going to be a mass exodus from Malmö.
*26:22.660- 26:25.860* :  But a few people I've spoken to are a bit worried
*26:25.860- 26:29.480* :  and they also just want this to be over with, really.
*26:30.060- 26:31.760* :  David Rasmussen from Swedish Radio.
*26:32.860- 26:35.360* :  Often it is the little things that wind us up.
*26:35.500- 26:37.660* :  And that seems to be the case in Northern England
*26:37.660- 26:39.660* :  where a simple punctuation mark
*26:39.660- 26:42.580* :  is at the centre of a row after the local council
*26:42.580- 26:46.540* :  decided to start phasing out apostrophes on street signs.
*26:47.020- 26:48.720* :  Stephanie Zacherson takes up the story.
*26:49.100- 26:51.240* :  The town of Herrigate in North Yorkshire
*26:51.240- 26:53.380* :  is known for its quaint streets, monuments
*26:53.380- 26:55.820* :  and being a fashionable spa resort.
*26:56.540- 26:58.500* :  And now also for its street signs
*26:58.540- 27:01.680* :  as gradually apostrophes are being dropped from them.
*27:02.220- 27:05.020* :  The local council said all new signs would be produced
*27:05.120- 27:06.600* :  without special characters,
*27:07.060- 27:09.080* :  including the hyphen and the ampersand,
*27:09.080- 27:10.000* :  the and sign,
*27:10.560- 27:13.520* :  as equals problems when searching for street names in databases.
*27:14.480- 27:18.300* :  And Andrew Keywood are not fans of the new signage.
*27:18.500- 27:19.800* :  If you start losing things like that,
*27:19.820- 27:21.660* :  then everything goes down here, doesn't it?
*27:22.320- 27:23.740* :  It is English language
*27:24.520- 27:27.380* :  and signs should contain proper language.
*27:27.920- 27:30.520* :  They both stood next to a street sign in Herrigate
*27:30.580- 27:31.980* :  at St Mary's Walk.
*27:32.640- 27:34.060* :  There's one of the old ones there,
*27:34.240- 27:35.640* :  but just a few metres away,
*27:35.640- 27:36.980* :  a new one has popped up
*27:37.480- 27:39.520* :  without the apostrophe after the Y.
*27:40.300- 27:42.980* :  But someone from the local grammar police
*27:42.980- 27:45.340* :  has been quick to add one in themselves
*27:46.120- 27:48.740* :  with what looks to be a dash of black paint.
*27:49.460- 27:53.440* :  Local postwoman Sam approves of the pen vigilantes move.
*27:53.840- 27:55.120* :  I've been an ex-seacher,
*27:55.560- 27:59.140* :  so trying to teach children the basics of grammar and punctuation
*27:59.180- 28:00.980* :  and then not to have it presented properly
*28:00.980- 28:01.960* :  when they're out and about,
*28:01.960- 28:04.280* :  yeah, bring back the apostrophe.
*28:04.860- 28:08.200* :  Dr Ellie Rye, who's a lecturer in English language and linguistics,
*28:08.640- 28:10.920* :  said she understood people's frustrations,
*28:11.620- 28:13.400* :  but pointed out that the English language
*28:13.400- 28:16.600* :  did make do without some punctuation marks
*28:16.760- 28:18.280* :  for quite a long time.
*28:18.640- 28:21.580* :  From about 1200 into about the 17th century,
*28:22.060- 28:23.880* :  then English didn't use apostrophes,
*28:24.200- 28:25.880* :  so we didn't have the same way of police
*28:25.880- 28:28.780* :  of distinguishing between pearls and possesses.
*28:29.240- 28:31.980* :  So we don't need apostrophes in speech to communicate,
*28:31.980- 28:35.020* :  and we also historically English didn't use them
*28:35.020- 28:35.940* :  for quite a long time.
*28:36.500- 28:38.800* :  And not everyone seems to mind the changes.
*28:39.300- 28:42.560* :  Another resident Ruby Wang works in a restaurant in town.
*28:42.880- 28:43.940* :  To be honest with you, right,
*28:44.000- 28:45.640* :  because I'm not from this country,
*28:46.160- 28:48.260* :  so for me, it doesn't matter,
*28:48.680- 28:50.420* :  because it's the same like pronunciation.
*28:51.360- 28:53.180* :  That report by Stephanie Zacherson.
*28:53.820- 28:57.260* :  The first Sunday of May is international dawn chorus day
*28:57.260- 28:59.140* :  when bird song reaches a crescendo,
*28:59.700- 29:01.560* :  males singing out to attract a mate
*29:01.560- 29:03.440* :  or warn rivals away from their territory.
*29:03.980- 29:05.620* :  People have been sending in their recordings
*29:05.620- 29:08.000* :  of this weekend's dawn choruses.
*29:08.380- 29:10.600* :  Tony Juniper, the environmentalist and writer,
*29:10.600- 29:12.380* :  spoke about the birds he could identify
*29:12.380- 29:14.440* :  in the recordings and what could be done
*29:14.440- 29:16.320* :  to protect the species that are in decline.
*29:25.840- 29:27.260* :  Very familiar birds there.
*29:27.260- 29:29.880* :  Blackbird, great tip, robin, red, black cap,
*29:29.880- 29:31.920* :  amongst the ones I just caught snippets of.
*29:32.560- 29:35.480* :  And of course, these birds are now, at this time of year,
*29:35.720- 29:37.560* :  really at the peak of that singing,
*29:38.160- 29:39.860* :  holding territories attracting mates,
*29:40.360- 29:44.220* :  and either side of sunrise, about an hour, either side.
*29:44.780- 29:47.580* :  You can just hear that incredible soundtrack of spring.
*29:47.580- 29:50.020* :  It really is one of the most uplifting sounds
*29:50.020- 29:51.140* :  I think we could hear.
*29:59.920- 30:02.740* :  One thing is having wild corners in our gardens,
*30:03.120- 30:04.620* :  holding off the pesticides,
*30:05.620- 30:08.580* :  making sure you're cleaning your bird feeders,
*30:09.040- 30:10.600* :  those kinds of things can all help.
*30:10.640- 30:12.680* :  And obviously, nest boxes and nest sites,
*30:12.680- 30:15.060* :  including swift bricks, are all very much
*30:15.580- 30:17.140* :  a part of the solution.
*30:17.640- 30:20.060* :  And really, I think actually quite a lot of this
*30:20.060- 30:21.540* :  comes down to insect food.
*30:21.540- 30:24.300* :  So most of our songbirds require insects,
*30:24.300- 30:26.320* :  even the seed eaters to feed their chicks.
*30:27.020- 30:30.040* :  And so having gardens that have got plenty of flowers,
*30:30.040- 30:31.220* :  plenty of wild plants,
*30:31.860- 30:33.680* :  not knowing the lawn so much,
*30:33.680- 30:34.920* :  maybe leaving some of the edges
*30:35.580- 30:37.160* :  so that you can create some habitat.
*30:37.160- 30:38.560* :  Those are all the kinds of things
*30:38.660- 30:39.800* :  that will help make a difference.
*30:45.140- 30:48.440* :  If you look at the size of the National Nature Reserve
*30:48.440- 30:51.780* :  estate in England that natural England declares,
*30:52.060- 30:55.260* :  actually our gardens combined are about four times bigger
*30:55.260- 30:57.700* :  than the entire National Nature Reserve estate.
*30:58.240- 30:59.820* :  So if we all did something in our gardens,
*30:59.860- 31:02.140* :  we probably could make a material difference.
*31:02.140- 31:03.560* :  And on top of the gardens, of course,
*31:03.560- 31:06.080* :  is all those lovely parks we have in our towns and cities.
*31:06.080- 31:08.980* :  So local councils can join in with this program
*31:08.980- 31:10.320* :  of leaving wilder areas,
*31:10.800- 31:12.020* :  putting in some native hedges.
*31:12.020- 31:15.360* :  Water is amazing in terms of places for birds
*31:15.360- 31:18.160* :  to drink in very hot conditions.
*31:18.200- 31:21.800* :  And also our insect factories producing food
*31:21.800- 31:22.820* :  for many of these birds.
*31:28.920- 31:31.180* :  Songtrash really is my very favorite bird,
*31:31.240- 31:32.540* :  the urban nightingale,
*31:33.000- 31:34.020* :  sometimes people call it.
*31:34.560- 31:36.480* :  And the absence of those really
*31:36.480- 31:38.580* :  has diminished the quality of springtime.
*31:38.580- 31:40.000* :  But I do hope they will come back.
*31:40.400- 31:42.020* :  And you know, these things do go up and down.
*31:42.280- 31:43.940* :  And if we do the right things,
*31:43.960- 31:45.800* :  we can help them come back quicker and stronger.
*31:56.980- 31:59.580* :  Environmentalist and writer Tony Juniper.
*32:02.640- 32:03.840* :  And that's all from us for now.
*32:03.840- 32:06.220* :  But the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:06.220- 32:08.120* :  This edition was mixed by Joe McCartney
*32:08.120- 32:09.680* :  and produced by Isabella Jewel.
