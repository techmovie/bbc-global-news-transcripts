*00:00.000- 00:03.600* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:04.760- 00:07.580* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Monday,
*00:07.580- 00:10.520* :  the 13th of May, these are our main stories.
*00:11.180- 00:14.540* :  Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced his long-standing
*00:14.540- 00:18.920* :  al-isogay Shogu as Defence Minister, a coalition of separatist
*00:18.920- 00:21.300* :  parties in the Spanish region of Catalonia,
*00:21.640- 00:24.300* :  loses its majority after regional elections.
*00:24.920- 00:28.740* :  And Tunisian police arrest a prominent lawyer and commentator,
*00:29.100- 00:31.420* :  a moment captured live on TV.
*00:33.300- 00:38.600* :  Also in this podcast, I came to Italy and I followed in his footsteps,
*00:38.600- 00:41.260* :  and I could look at his paintings and his drawings,
*00:41.380- 00:45.040* :  and I could see the landscape even after all these years.
*00:45.040- 00:50.460* :  The geologist who claims to have solved the mystery of where the Mona Lisa was painted.
*00:54.900- 01:00.000* :  Weeks after his resounding and entirely expected re-election as Russian president,
*01:00.000- 01:03.620* :  Vladimir Putin is ringing the changes in the Kremlin hierarchy.
*01:03.660- 01:06.700* :  He's replaced his long-time al-isogay Shogu,
*01:06.960- 01:09.040* :  who's been Defence Minister since 2012,
*01:09.440- 01:12.280* :  and a key player in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*01:12.740- 01:16.860* :  The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had this explanation for the change.
*01:17.660- 01:18.860* :  Minister Mabarovna Kakwa,
*01:18.940- 01:23.040* :  Andrej Balusov has been appointed Minister of Defence, as you know.
*01:23.680- 01:27.200* :  Perhaps what is important to note is today, on the battlefield,
*01:27.200- 01:30.920* :  the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,
*01:31.020- 01:35.180* :  more open to its implementation as quickly as possible.
*01:35.600- 01:38.440* :  And therefore, it's natural that at the current stage,
*01:38.440- 01:44.780* :  the president has decided to have a civilian as head of the Ministry of Defence.
*01:47.680- 01:49.360* :  For more on this, and what it might mean,
*01:49.360- 01:52.340* :  I've been talking to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg.
*01:52.720- 01:57.440* :  I began by asking him if, on the face of it, this was a straightforward demotion.
*01:58.020- 02:01.480* :  I think it's a demotion. Yes, I mean, he's not out completely.
*02:01.480- 02:06.500* :  He's being moved to the Russian Security Council, so, you know, he still has a job.
*02:07.200- 02:11.520* :  But I think, as far as Russian politics goes, that is a demotion.
*02:11.980- 02:15.040* :  Sergey Shogu has been Defence Minister for 12 years,
*02:15.180- 02:18.000* :  and he was appointed by Vladimir Putin back in 2012.
*02:18.000- 02:20.220* :  The two men have been very close for some time.
*02:20.260- 02:23.500* :  They used to go on holiday together, even, to Siberia.
*02:23.820- 02:28.340* :  And, you know, last week, we were on Red Square watching the annual Victory Day parade.
*02:28.800- 02:30.920* :  And Defence Minister Shogu was there.
*02:30.920- 02:33.920* :  He was taking part in the parade, inspecting the troops.
*02:34.540- 02:40.280* :  But there had been rumors for some time now that his position had grown weaker.
*02:40.620- 02:44.660* :  I mean, you know, although President Putin has been growing more confident
*02:45.020- 02:47.920* :  about the way the war in Ukraine has been going for Russia,
*02:48.740- 02:51.560* :  it did not go at all according to plan.
*02:51.560- 02:55.320* :  This so-called special military operation that the Kremlin talks about
*02:55.520- 03:00.320* :  was only supposed to take a few days, a few weeks maximum back in 2022.
*03:01.060- 03:02.640* :  It's now into its third year.
*03:03.380- 03:07.460* :  So, there had been talk for some time that Mr. Shogu could lose his job,
*03:07.460- 03:10.760* :  and that is exactly, I think, what is going to happen.
*03:11.160- 03:14.520* :  So, what's going to change particularly in regard to the war in Ukraine?
*03:14.980- 03:17.500* :  OK, well, the key point, I think, we have to make,
*03:17.500- 03:20.880* :  is that whoever the government ministers are in Russia,
*03:20.880- 03:23.360* :  whoever sits around that cabinet table,
*03:24.080- 03:27.940* :  there is one man and one man alone who calls the shots in Russia.
*03:28.000- 03:29.060* :  That is Vladimir Putin.
*03:29.160- 03:31.180* :  This is a presidential system.
*03:31.780- 03:33.500* :  The power is in the hands of the president,
*03:34.100- 03:36.480* :  and it was his decision to start the war in Ukraine,
*03:36.480- 03:39.160* :  to invade, to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*03:39.840- 03:42.360* :  and all the big decisions are taken by him.
*03:42.980- 03:47.400* :  Having said that, it is interesting when reshuffles happen in the government,
*03:47.400- 03:49.240* :  particularly of the key ministers.
*03:49.340- 03:50.540* :  It doesn't happen very often.
*03:51.060- 03:52.900* :  You look at Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister,
*03:52.900- 03:55.720* :  he's been doing the job for 20 years.
*03:56.400- 04:00.020* :  And as I say, Mr. Shogu had been to Vets Minister for 12 years,
*04:00.420- 04:02.940* :  but it is interesting that he's being replaced.
*04:02.940- 04:07.000* :  It looks like, by an economist, Andrei Belosev.
*04:07.580- 04:10.620* :  And I think that reflects the fact that over the last couple of years,
*04:11.180- 04:14.100* :  the economy in Russia has been put on a war footing,
*04:14.100- 04:17.980* :  and that President Putin wants a man who understands economic matters
*04:18.420- 04:19.460* :  to be in the defence ministry.
*04:19.720- 04:23.720* :  Of course, there was a very public rower between the head of the Vagna Group
*04:23.820- 04:27.600* :  and Mr. Shogu, which ended in the head of the Vagna Group,
*04:28.320- 04:30.120* :  dying in an untimely plane crash.
*04:30.700- 04:32.680* :  Yes, Mr. Plegorschen, you are absolutely right.
*04:32.680- 04:35.600* :  And when that very public rower was raging,
*04:35.600- 04:39.400* :  President Putin took the side of Sergei Shogu.
*04:39.580- 04:44.640* :  So, Mr. Plegorschen had demanded that Mr. Shogu be replaced and sacked.
*04:44.840- 04:48.760* :  That didn't happen, because Vladimir Putin doesn't like being told what to do.
*04:48.760- 04:50.740* :  He doesn't like giving into pressure.
*04:51.400- 04:53.300* :  So, he took the side of Sergei Shogu,
*04:53.760- 04:59.140* :  and after the Vagna mutiny failed, it seemed as if Mr. Shogu's position
*04:59.140- 05:00.880* :  had strengthened considerably.
*05:01.780- 05:04.880* :  But, you know, time has gone on, and the rumours began,
*05:04.880- 05:09.720* :  that, actually, he had lost the support, the favour of the president
*05:10.280- 05:14.020* :  to a large extent, and would not hold on to his job for much longer.
*05:14.020- 05:15.320* :  That's exactly what has happened.
*05:15.500- 05:18.060* :  Steve Rosenberg, staying with the war,
*05:18.060- 05:22.060* :  the commander of Ukraine's armed forces has warned that his troops are struggling
*05:22.060- 05:25.300* :  to hold their positions in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv
*05:25.600- 05:28.720* :  after Russian forces launched a fresh assault last week.
*05:28.720- 05:32.640* :  And the regional governor said that all areas of the northern border
*05:32.640- 05:35.140* :  were under enemy fire almost constantly.
*05:35.600- 05:38.000* :  Moscow claims to have captured another four villages
*05:38.520- 05:40.200* :  after seizing five on Saturday.
*05:40.740- 05:45.540* :  Our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel reports from Vovchansk in Kharkiv.
*05:51.360- 05:56.660* :  The town of Vovchansk was liberated in a surprise Ukrainian offensive less than two years ago.
*05:58.020- 06:01.400* :  Now, it's at risk of falling back into Russian hands again.
*06:02.180- 06:05.880* :  There's a heavy artillery battle surrounding this Kharkiv town.
*06:06.960- 06:08.880* :  Most of the population have already fled.
*06:09.880- 06:12.840* :  Alexey, a local policeman, is telling the rest to leave.
*06:14.440- 06:15.960* :  He says it's better than dying.
*06:17.020- 06:20.760* :  The shelling is constant and chaotic, and it's all over the town.
*06:23.380- 06:26.760* :  All that's left of Serhi's home is a burnt-out shell.
*06:27.740- 06:30.940* :  He's the latest victim of a now familiar Russian tactic
*06:31.580- 06:34.660* :  of reducing Ukrainian towns and villages to rub.
*06:38.580- 06:40.320* :  But Serhi says he can't leave.
*06:41.140- 06:42.780* :  He needs to look after his goats.
*06:43.780- 06:46.240* :  Now, his only worldly possessions.
*06:49.180- 06:51.640* :  You can still hear the artillery battle going on.
*06:52.260- 06:53.980* :  It was more intense yesterday.
*06:54.820- 06:59.600* :  This devastation, one man's house, was created by a Russian glide bomb.
*07:01.080- 07:02.500* :  And that's the sound of a jet somewhere.
*07:14.680- 07:20.660* :  Ukraine's outgunned and outnumbered, and Russia's using aerial glide bombs to brutal effect.
*07:22.380- 07:25.920* :  For some, it's made the decision to flee unavoidable.
*07:27.780- 07:29.920* :  Though it's still heartbreaking for Alexander,
*07:30.980- 07:37.020* :  he does the sign of the cross and tenderly touches the ground as he leaves the home he grew up in.
*07:38.120- 07:41.040* :  But it's now simply too dangerous to stay.
*07:47.500- 07:48.980* :  This is never been like that before.
*07:49.860- 07:53.260* :  Thousands, thousands of shells, thousands of shells.
*07:54.480- 08:00.080* :  The house was jumping, so that you understand, and now it jumped literally in front of you.
*08:05.320- 08:08.880* :  But something you've already fought for before in 2022.
*08:10.360- 08:10.900* :  So, say him again.
*08:11.500- 08:12.040* :  Say him again.
*08:12.100- 08:12.600* :  You're angry?
*08:13.440- 08:14.060* :  Very angry.
*08:14.400- 08:19.540* :  Denis Yaroslavsky is the commander of a specialist Ukrainian reconnaissance unit.
*08:20.480- 08:24.040* :  He believes this latest Russian offensive was avoidable.
*08:24.420- 08:31.100* :  If Ukraine had prepared better defenses, he shows me video from a drone feed of Russian soldiers
*08:31.720- 08:34.740* :  appearing to walk across the border unopposed.
*08:36.260- 08:39.120* :  At the time, he watched it in disbelief.
*08:41.080- 08:43.080* :  There was no first line of defense.
*08:44.740- 08:47.200* :  We saw it. The Russians just walked in.
*08:48.260- 08:49.520* :  Where were the minefields?
*08:50.140- 08:51.040* :  They just walked in.
*08:52.320- 08:57.960* :  Denis helped push bank the Russians here in that surprise Ukrainian offensive in 2022.
*08:59.180- 09:02.120* :  Now he and his men are being asked to do the same again.
*09:03.000- 09:07.420* :  Ukrainian officials insist they were prepared for this latest Russian assault,
*09:08.580- 09:12.940* :  but Harkiv has exposed a weakness in Ukraine's defenses.
*09:15.040- 09:15.860* :  Jonathan Beal.
*09:16.740- 09:20.520* :  Israel may not be giving into international pressure to stop its military
*09:20.520- 09:26.260* :  incursion in Raffa in southern Gaza, but it is allowing more aid into the Palestinian territory.
*09:26.260- 09:29.900* :  A new crossing has been opened in coordination with the United States.
*09:29.900- 09:34.400* :  Israel said that dozens of trucks carrying flour from the World Food Program
*09:34.740- 09:36.080* :  have entered northern Gaza.
*09:36.400- 09:40.860* :  In the south, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have now left Raffa for the coast
*09:41.280- 09:43.200* :  in anticipation of an Israeli attack.
*09:43.200- 09:48.800* :  The UN Human Rights Chief Volkotirk said that orders issued by Israel had shown chaos.
*09:49.320- 09:54.580* :  The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Raffa.
*09:55.580- 09:56.860* :  So where should they go now?
*09:57.600- 09:59.520* :  There is no safe place in Gaza.
*10:00.340- 10:05.660* :  These exhausted, famished people, many of whom have been displaced many times already,
*10:06.040- 10:07.040* :  have no good options.
*10:07.800- 10:12.700* :  Other towns across Gaza, including Hanyunis, which is supposed to receive those who are being
*10:12.700- 10:18.160* :  displaced from Raffa right now, have already been reduced to rubble and remained under attack.
*10:18.940- 10:20.760* :  These are not safe places.
*10:21.440- 10:25.960* :  The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Binkin said that Israel lacked a credible plan to
*10:25.960- 10:27.560* :  protect civilians in Raffa.
*10:27.940- 10:31.760* :  I heard more from our diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams.
*10:31.780- 10:37.320* :  We've had, once again, American officials both Anthony Binkin and the National Security
*10:37.320- 10:41.940* :  Advisor, Jake Sullivan, being interviewed on an American television today, essentially issuing
*10:41.940- 10:45.660* :  the same warnings that we have heard from the Biden administration.
*10:45.780- 10:52.440* :  Very anxious, perhaps desperate, to prevent and all out Israeli assault on the most populated
*10:52.440- 10:53.960* :  areas of Raffa.
*10:54.320- 10:59.280* :  There was also an interesting warning from Anthony Binkin saying, and I'm quoting here,
*10:59.280- 11:04.600* :  that Israel is on a trajectory to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas fighters left,
*11:05.300- 11:11.460* :  or a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy, and probably refilled by Hamas.
*11:11.460- 11:17.800* :  The Americans have noted that this weekend, the Israeli military returned to parts of the
*11:17.800- 11:22.920* :  northern Gaza Strip, where they had already carried out operations many, many months ago,
*11:23.520- 11:28.860* :  and in fact four Israeli soldiers were killed in that fighting, suggesting that Hamas still
*11:28.860- 11:33.820* :  has the ability to pop up in places where perhaps the Israelis thought that they had already
*11:34.220- 11:35.000* :  dealt with the threat.
*11:35.340- 11:42.720* :  So I think the warning is, really, don't do Raffa, and that Israel is in real danger of inheriting
*11:42.720- 11:49.960* :  a very lawless, unpredictable situation throughout the Gaza Strip, unless somehow it changes track.
*11:50.320- 11:56.300* :  So it may not be an all-out ground offensive in Raffa yet, but it's still a pretty serious
*11:56.300- 11:57.940* :  military operation, isn't it?
*11:58.380- 12:03.520* :  Oh, it certainly is, and it is already having very significant effects, not least,
*12:03.580- 12:09.940* :  the fact that as many as 300,000 people have already been forced to leave the Raffa area.
*12:10.340- 12:16.560* :  Now that is a little short of a quarter of the entire civilian population of the Raffa area.
*12:16.960- 12:21.280* :  Most of the people who have left are people who had arrived to seek shelter in Raffa from other
*12:21.280- 12:28.200* :  parts of the Gaza Strip further north in previous months. We're seeing these people moving west
*12:28.320- 12:36.140* :  and north, filling up these already overcrowded areas along the coast where there is no sanitation,
*12:36.140- 12:39.840* :  there's no running water, people essentially are having to fend for themselves,
*12:40.680- 12:43.020* :  and it's becoming incredibly congested.
*12:43.340- 12:48.720* :  And as you indicate, still a huge humanitarian crisis, but there is a new crossing point
*12:48.720- 12:49.600* :  into the Strip.
*12:50.040- 12:53.340* :  Yeah, so this is what the Israelis are calling western areas.
*12:53.340- 12:58.980* :  This is in the far northern part of the Gaza Strip, close to the areas crossing, which in days
*12:58.980- 13:03.140* :  before the war was the main civilian crossing point, but which the Israelis have been using
*13:03.140- 13:10.820* :  for aid convoys in recent days, and the Israelis are saying that this crossing point will see
*13:10.820- 13:17.340* :  the flow of additional aid into the north where the conditions for civilians is arguably the worst
*13:17.340- 13:22.220* :  of anywhere in the Gaza Strip with the whole area, teetering on the edge of starvation.
*13:22.680- 13:28.880* :  Paul Adams, a coalition of separatist parties in the Spanish region of Catalonia has lost
*13:28.880- 13:32.320* :  its majority after Sunday's elections for the regional parliament.
*13:32.320- 13:34.820* :  Separatists have governed there for a decade.
*13:34.820- 13:40.200* :  The Socialist Party, which governs Spain nationally, is emerging as the biggest in the
*13:40.200- 13:43.180* :  Catalan Chamber, but would need to make alliances to govern.
*13:43.580- 13:47.260* :  Our correspondent in Madrid, Guy Hegeco, gave us this update.
*13:47.680- 13:52.580* :  I mean, this is certainly a very good result for the socialists of Spanish Prime Minister
*13:52.580- 13:59.020* :  Pedro Sánchez. They've made gains on their last result from three years ago when they did
*13:59.020- 14:02.940* :  actually win the election, but were unable to form a government. They've performed even better
*14:02.940- 14:08.960* :  than that. So this is a really good result for them, and Pedro Sánchez himself and his
*14:08.960- 14:14.660* :  Socialist Party seem to see this very much as vindication of his policies in Catalonia,
*14:15.120- 14:20.980* :  and in particular that very controversial amnesty law that he's pushed through benefiting Catalan
*14:20.980- 14:25.760* :  separatists. So certainly Pedro Sánchez seems to feel vindicated, and this is very much a boost
*14:25.800- 14:32.600* :  for him in general. The Catalan political landscape has very fragmented, because they have
*14:32.600- 14:36.180* :  this division between left and right, which you have across the rest of Spain, obviously,
*14:36.820- 14:41.880* :  but also in Catalonia what you have is the division between unionists and separatists,
*14:41.960- 14:48.240* :  and so that complicates matters very much. And that has been the case for many years, but it's
*14:48.680- 14:55.060* :  probably more fragmented now than it has been even before. You've got the Socialists with a very
*14:55.060- 15:00.320* :  clear victory, and yet it's not a given that they will be able to form a government, because in
*15:00.320- 15:04.780* :  order to form a government, they'll probably need the support of the Catalan Republican left,
*15:04.780- 15:10.240* :  who are a pro-independence party. Now many people may feel that that's a likely alliance that will
*15:10.240- 15:17.020* :  end up forming a government, but it's not certainly not a given. So it's not going to be easy for
*15:17.020- 15:21.680* :  the Socialists to form a government. They won the election three years ago and were not able to
*15:21.680- 15:26.640* :  do so. So I think the conversations that take place between the parties in the coming days and
*15:26.640- 15:35.440* :  weeks are going to be lengthy and very complex. Guy Hedgeko. Still to come in the global news podcast.
*15:35.440- 15:42.840* :  He is back after his 29 successful summit, and he might go back for his 30th attempt this season.
*15:43.060- 15:50.760* :  No one is known as Everest Man. The man who's climbed Mount Everest 29 times and he's not stopping there.
*15:58.980- 16:02.080* :  A dramatic arrest captured on French TV.
*16:13.440- 16:19.920* :  This was the moment Tunisia lawyer and commentator Sonia Damani was forcibly seized by
*16:19.920- 16:25.260* :  hooded police in the capital Tunis. Her arrest was captured on camera during a live broadcast
*16:25.260- 16:31.100* :  of France 24. Later that evening, two prominent Tunisian journalists were also detained.
*16:31.100- 16:38.660* :  Ms Damani had been publicly critical of President Kaes Sayed's immigration policy and four in her
*16:38.660- 16:44.900* :  words, turning Tunisia into border guards for Europe. Dozens of lawyers, journalists and critics
*16:44.900- 16:52.440* :  are being arrested under a 2022 law called Decree 54, which critics argue is used to crush
*16:52.440- 16:58.820* :  dissent. Alicia Volkman is a journalist based in the Tunisian capital. I would say this is actually
*16:58.820- 17:04.980* :  a watershed moment, because up till now the arrests of political critics of Kaes Sayed
*17:05.300- 17:09.360* :  have always taken place deep in the middle of the night with police sort of waiting outside
*17:09.360- 17:16.200* :  somebody's house. This happened in a public place. The Bar Association is actually inside the
*17:16.200- 17:23.340* :  Palace of Justice. The main court within Tunis is very significant. It shows a big shift
*17:23.920- 17:28.920* :  in how emboldened the police and the new more authoritarian regime actually is now.
*17:29.500- 17:33.960* :  What we're already seeing is significant members of civil society being arrested
*17:34.540- 17:40.600* :  on what seemed to be trumped up charges, such as Sadia Muspa, who is the head of Menemti,
*17:40.600- 17:45.540* :  which is a very important association. It's the association that pushed through the anti-racism
*17:45.540- 17:53.280* :  law back in 2018. So it's not disconnected from Sonya's case, because both have been battling to
*17:53.280- 18:00.100* :  expose the cruelty and abuses of the Tunisian state against Black migrants. But both are a watershed
*18:00.100- 18:07.460* :  moment, because this signals an increased level of audacity and impunity and confidence in
*18:07.460- 18:15.300* :  terms of shutting down more critical voices, but also civil society that has been so strong since
*18:15.300- 18:22.640* :  the 2011 revolution. freelance journalist Alicia Volkman. The fire season in Canada has started
*18:22.640- 18:27.280* :  earlier than usual, forcing thousands of people in the western province of British Columbia
*18:27.280- 18:32.220* :  to leave their homes. Fires are also burning in the neighbouring province of Alberta.
*18:32.220- 18:37.700* :  The government in Ottawa is worried there could be a repeat of last summer when blazes got so
*18:37.700- 18:43.880* :  out of control eight firefighters died in trying to tackle them. Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*18:44.520- 18:51.120* :  Canada may be used to wildfires, but last year's were its worst on record. More than six and a half
*18:51.120- 18:57.500* :  thousand fires burned for months covering 15 million hectares of land, seven times the annual
*18:57.500- 19:04.940* :  average. Now some fear that pattern is starting again and early, with evacuation alerts across two
*19:04.940- 19:11.580* :  provinces and major highways closed due to smoke. One large fire near Fort McMurray has been listed
*19:11.580- 19:17.720* :  as out of control. Thousands of people have been ordered to leave their homes and helicopter pilots
*19:17.720- 19:24.040* :  are monitoring the flames using night vision equipment. The federal government is warning Canadians
*19:24.040- 19:30.200* :  that another catastrophic season could be ahead with higher than normal spring and summer temperatures
*19:30.200- 19:37.660* :  expected. A warmer than normal winter also saw what experts called zombie fires still smoldering
*19:37.660- 19:44.100* :  under layers of snow and the ground is now drier and more susceptible to catching a light than usual.
*19:45.020- 19:49.880* :  The Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has met with fire chiefs and warned that people are worried
*19:49.880- 19:55.080* :  about what summer may bring and what the future may hold. Stephanie Prentice,
*19:55.920- 20:02.220* :  to Australia now a country which has in recent years created quite a name for itself as a producer
*20:02.720- 20:13.280* :  of good wine. But right now instead of flowing freely in homes and wine bars
*20:13.380- 20:20.720* :  half a billion litres of perfectly good red white and rosé is sitting unused in storage tanks.
*20:20.720- 20:26.200* :  That's because there's a global surplus of wine production is still going well but fewer
*20:26.200- 20:32.400* :  people are drinking it. In fact the situation is so bad in Australia that farmers are giving up
*20:32.920- 20:38.140* :  and destroying grapevines in order to grow something else more from our Sydney correspondent Phil
*20:39.040- 20:45.380* :  In inland regions of Australia where most of this country's bulk wine is produced prices for
*20:45.380- 20:52.380* :  grapes have fallen by more than 50 percent over the past few years. Growers here have had to
*20:52.380- 20:59.100* :  diversify trying to sell their wine into other countries. A big reason for that were wine tariffs
*20:59.100- 21:06.980* :  imposed by China in 2020 overnight. China went from being Australia's biggest overseas wine
*21:06.980- 21:15.540* :  market to a very small one so lots of factors playing into this those tariffs from China and also
*21:15.540- 21:22.900* :  a global downturn in wine consumption. Tastes are changing many younger people simply don't share
*21:22.900- 21:29.600* :  the habits of their parents there are health concerns the popularity of non-alcoholic beverages
*21:29.600- 21:36.960* :  and also speciality beer really eating in to wine consumption. There was a report from the
*21:36.960- 21:42.980* :  international organization of vine and wine this is an industry body it showed that global
*21:42.980- 21:52.820* :  consumption of wine last year was 200 and 21 million hecto liters now a hecto liter is 100 liters
*21:52.820- 22:00.280* :  so 221 million hecto liters sounds an awful lot of wine to be drunk last year but it is in fact
*22:00.280- 22:08.160* :  the lowest level of wine consumption since 1996. Already we're seeing millions of vines being
*22:08.160- 22:13.420* :  ripped out of the grounds because it's simply not economic for growers to produce grapes
*22:13.420- 22:20.560* :  in the way that they once did. Australia simply is being hit hard by this global downturn in wine
*22:20.560- 22:29.140* :  consumption. Phil Messer in Sydney. Back again to the top of the world one man's job another's dream
*22:29.140- 22:36.180* :  the words of Nepalese Sherpa Camille Rita who on Sunday morning beat his own record by reaching
*22:36.180- 22:43.380* :  the summit of Mount Everest for the 29th time. Navin Singhaka is the BBC World Service Environment
*22:43.380- 22:49.460* :  correspondent he told Oliver Conway that the so-called Everest man who's been tackling the world's
*22:49.460- 22:55.060* :  tallest mountain for 30 years isn't finished with climbing. I just had a quick chat with the
*22:55.060- 23:01.200* :  officials in Kathmandu the Department of Tourism mountaineering section and they told me that
*23:01.200- 23:08.360* :  his back after his 29th successful summit and he might go back for his 30th attempt this season
*23:08.360- 23:14.300* :  with another team so you know that's what he does no wonder he's known as Everest man.
*23:14.740- 23:18.960* :  Yeah why does he want to keep going up the world's tallest mountain doesn't it get a bit boring
*23:18.960- 23:24.200* :  aren't there other challenges he'd like to pursue? Well the thing is this is his bread and butter
*23:24.200- 23:29.880* :  number one so that the more he does the more he earns as simple as that also let's not forget that
*23:29.880- 23:37.280* :  climbing Mount Everest for record number of time that status that position that fame is always
*23:37.280- 23:43.060* :  there and then also the third factor competition if he doesn't do it somebody else is chasing him
*23:43.060- 23:49.420* :  so there is a kind of presser that pushes these people up there but then of course there are some
*23:49.420- 23:54.980* :  who decide not to do it again the retire but he hasn't done that yet and over the years that he's
*23:54.980- 24:00.660* :  been doing it how has that journey up to the summit of the world how has that changed? There are two
*24:00.660- 24:07.160* :  things here first of all when it comes to rope fixing ladder fixing we all know that Mount Everest
*24:07.160- 24:13.760* :  is the highest peak in the world technically it is not as difficult as say the second highest
*24:13.760- 24:20.040* :  peak in the world K2 in Pakistan because it's all fixed the road the ladder I'm not saying that's
*24:20.040- 24:27.280* :  easy but comparatively it's easy that is why so many people attempt to go but at the same time
*24:27.280- 24:32.980* :  what climate change global warming is doing how it is changing those landscape the kumu ice fall
*24:32.980- 24:38.500* :  you know it's becoming increasingly treacherous and then mountaineers finding water flowing at
*24:38.500- 24:43.800* :  camp 2 camp 3 these are significant challenges that is why for instance this time then if
*24:43.800- 24:49.960* :  please government for the first time allowed helicopters to ferry all this equipment right up to
*24:49.960- 24:56.680* :  camp water camp 2 avoiding the tricky kumu ice fall so that is a changing thing how dangerous it
*24:56.680- 25:05.440* :  becomes it remains unknown Navin Singh Khakka now from towering mountains to other much smaller rock
*25:05.440- 25:11.240* :  formations it's the most famous painting in the world and still shrouded in mystery Leonardo
*25:11.240- 25:18.260* :  Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is best known for her enigmatic smile but more than 500 years on from her
*25:18.260- 25:25.180* :  creation questions still remain about many elements in the portrait now one of those mysteries may
*25:25.180- 25:32.180* :  have been solved the geologist and Renaissance art historian Anne Pizzeruso has used her two fields
*25:32.180- 25:38.700* :  of expertise to identify what she says is the location of the background landscape and she presented
*25:38.700- 25:45.640* :  her findings at a conference in northern Italy this weekend she told least to set about her discovery
*25:46.160- 25:53.040* :  I'm a geologist and I started studying Leonardo Da Vinci and what I found out is I always thought
*25:53.040- 25:59.220* :  he was just an artist but he's a great geologist I consider him the father of geology and when I
*25:59.220- 26:06.260* :  started studying it I came to Italy and I followed in his footsteps and I could look at his paintings
*26:06.260- 26:12.680* :  and his drawings and I could see the landscape even after all these years while you're rewriting art
*26:12.680- 26:20.060* :  history Da Vinci I don't know and it's so tell us what you what your conclusion is where was it?
*26:20.900- 26:28.380* :  what happened was when I first came to this area around leko and lecoma this is where Leonardo
*26:28.380- 26:35.360* :  spent a great deal of time because he was trying to build a canal from Milan up to Lake Cuomo and he
*26:35.360- 26:40.900* :  couldn't do it because there were certain sections where it was too rocky and so I went into the
*26:40.900- 26:46.900* :  mountains with a wonderful Alpine guide I'm a city slicker from the New York so it was really
*26:46.900- 26:53.580* :  something out of a movie we went to try to find all of these places and we actually found it
*26:54.100- 27:00.480* :  one of Leonardo's trademarks is geological accuracy you look at any painting where he had rocks
*27:00.480- 27:09.040* :  or botany and it's perfectly natural perfectly identifiable that's one of his trademarks is
*27:09.040- 27:16.340* :  geological and botanical accuracy and when we came to leko I looked because I had all my art books
*27:16.640- 27:22.460* :  and I said well you know this is the area where he painted the Mona Lisa but I really didn't do
*27:22.460- 27:28.400* :  anything with it I would tell different friends about it but finally when my art history colleague
*27:28.400- 27:35.160* :  Jacques Fronc in Paris is doing the definitive work on Leonardo he asked me to look into it
*27:35.820- 27:41.200* :  and I did and I found out that everybody was just looking at bridges which it's like looking for
*27:41.200- 27:47.000* :  many Cooper they were all over the place in Italy and you have to have a bridge but you have to have
*27:47.000- 27:54.260* :  also the geology and the lake and it was here and now with all of the new instruments that we
*27:54.260- 28:02.400* :  have with Google Map, Google Earth and different grounds it all fell into place. Geologist and
*28:02.400- 28:11.960* :  Renaissance art historian Anne Pizzeroso and that's all from us for now but there'll be a new
*28:11.960- 28:17.820* :  edition of the Global News Podcast later if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics
