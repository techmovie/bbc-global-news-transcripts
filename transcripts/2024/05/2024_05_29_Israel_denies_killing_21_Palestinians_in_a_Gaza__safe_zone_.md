*01:31.240- 01:34.540* :  You're listening to the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:37.280- 01:41.960* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday the 29th of May.
*01:41.960- 01:47.440* :  Israel has denied killing more than 20 Palestinians in a camp in a so-called safe zone in Gaza.
*01:48.240- 01:53.100* :  A jury in New York has been hearing fine arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial
*01:53.580- 01:58.700* :  and an inquiry has opened in Kenya into alleged abuses by British soldiers.
*02:01.700- 02:06.140* :  Also in the podcast I was just really disappointed about the selection of clothing that exists
*02:06.840- 02:11.100* :  and how about it just isn't thought about more so I decided to design some myself.
*02:11.680- 02:14.080* :  The cancer survivor turned fashion designer.
*02:19.560- 02:25.280* :  Days after an Israeli airstrike on a camp on the edge of Rafa left dozens dead.
*02:25.280- 02:30.680* :  Israel has been accused of killing another 21 Palestinians more than half of them women.
*02:30.700- 02:36.600* :  Emergency services in Gaza said four tank shells hit a cluster of tents in Al-Mawasi.
*02:37.100- 02:41.620* :  The supposed safe zone that the Israelis had told Palestinians to move to to escape the
*02:41.620- 02:48.860* :  fighting in Rafa. Israel has denied striking Al-Mawasi. It has also revealed its initial findings about
*02:48.860- 02:54.080* :  the airstrike which sparked the deadly fire on Sunday night. Israeli military spokesman Daniel
*02:54.080- 03:00.020* :  Hagari said the bombs they had used to target two Hamas leaders were not powerful enough to cause
*03:00.020- 03:05.460* :  the blaze on their own. Our ammunition alone could not have ignited a fire of this size.
*03:05.960- 03:12.360* :  We are looking into all possibilities including the option that weapons stored in a compound
*03:12.360- 03:19.100* :  next to our target which we did not know of may have ignited as a result of the strike.
*03:19.640- 03:25.720* :  It should be noted Hamas has been operating from this area since October 7th.
*03:26.400- 03:31.500* :  Well, for an idea of the devastation being caused in Gaza we heard from James Smith,
*03:31.500- 03:36.260* :  a British doctor working with the NGO Cadus, currently based in Al-Mawasi.
*03:36.660- 03:42.120* :  Until yesterday we were still working at a trauma stabilization point in the west of Rafa.
*03:42.300- 03:47.000* :  Overnight last night the situation deteriorated so significantly that the staff
*03:47.560- 03:53.120* :  that we work alongside and the patients that were in the facility had to flee from the clinic.
*03:53.920- 03:59.760* :  And as of today we have determined that it's no longer safe for us to move into the west of Rafa.
*03:59.980- 04:03.940* :  This is something that's affecting not only us as a humanitarian organization
*04:04.860- 04:09.560* :  but several other humanitarian organizations. In fact the entire humanitarian system
*04:10.100- 04:17.600* :  it is incredibly difficult to maintain even the most limited level of operationality at the moment.
*04:18.520- 04:22.460* :  We are here to see patients and to work alongside our Palestinian colleagues
*04:22.460- 04:28.620* :  but the situation is so dangerous and so violent that it's incredibly difficult to
*04:29.580- 04:33.640* :  get anywhere near where those patients are in the greatest need.
*04:34.300- 04:38.120* :  And you're really Al-Mawasi now and what are conditions like there?
*04:38.740- 04:42.880* :  People living in incredibly difficult and undignified conditions.
*04:43.940- 04:49.360* :  The smell of sewage is persistent. People are lacking access to clean water.
*04:50.040- 04:53.540* :  Water is being moved on the back of donkey carts for people.
*04:54.160- 04:58.700* :  And these are sprawling IDP camps. When you look from the coastal road inland,
*04:58.800- 05:04.780* :  all you can see is tents. There is very little space for any more tents at this stage.
*05:05.180- 05:11.780* :  British doctor James Smith. Jakov Katz is former editor of the Jerusalem Post and the
*05:11.780- 05:17.940* :  military specialist. So a tent camp reportedly sheled. What does he think might have happened?
*05:18.540- 05:22.460* :  We've heard those reports as well but I haven't heard any confirmation from the Israeli
*05:22.460- 05:27.540* :  site. Unlike the incident that took place earlier this week which Israel said and expressed a regret
*05:27.540- 05:33.580* :  for which led to that blaze that I'm tragically killed several dozen Palestinians.
*05:34.280- 05:37.340* :  Now this is something that Israel saying they're not aware of. They don't know that they had
*05:37.340- 05:41.320* :  any involvement in it and I would take everything that we hear from Hamas with a very serious
*05:41.320- 05:47.960* :  grain of salt. And that explanation from Admiral Haggari is to what happened on Sunday
*05:48.980- 05:56.680* :  with the fire and his speculation that it was actually caused by an ammunition dump
*05:57.160- 06:02.900* :  exploding. Do you find that plausible? I look, Israel is looking into this thing and is investigating
*06:02.900- 06:08.220* :  exactly what happened. Israel has throughout the last seven months of this conflict trying to
*06:08.220- 06:14.000* :  prosecute this war in the most precise and accurate way possible, very difficult in an area like
*06:14.000- 06:19.540* :  the Gaza Strip where Hamas embeds itself significantly and extensively throughout the civilian
*06:19.540- 06:23.900* :  population. So Israel was going after a target that was outside of the humanitarian zone as it
*06:23.900- 06:29.860* :  has shown on the maps to legitimately eliminate top Hamas leaders. They've named to these people are
*06:29.860- 06:34.580* :  and the two that were killed. It's very possible that a piece of shrapnel from those
*06:35.260- 06:39.540* :  munitions that were dropped by Israel did set off secondary explosions. We've seen this happen
*06:39.540- 06:44.580* :  all the time, right? When Israel bombs the target in Gaza, where there are weapons, there are
*06:44.580- 06:49.000* :  secondary explosions. It could be that something like that happened and set off a fire at this.
*06:49.000- 06:53.300* :  It doesn't really make much of a difference because the tragedy of those people who were killed
*06:54.000- 06:59.320* :  remains the same. But I think that whichever way you look at it, Israel was not targeting those
*06:59.320- 07:05.140* :  civilians. It was going after those Hamas leaders. Yakov Katz who liked James Smith was talking to
*07:05.140- 07:11.800* :  Julian Marshall. The prosecution and defense have been setting out their closing arguments in an
*07:11.800- 07:17.640* :  extended session at Donald Trump's first and possibly only criminal trial. The former US
*07:17.640- 07:22.640* :  president has accused of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult
*07:22.640- 07:29.180* :  film star Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 election. He denies all 34 counts. If found guilty,
*07:29.180- 07:34.500* :  Mr. Trump would become the first former US president with a criminal conviction. On his way into court,
*07:58.540- 08:04.040* :  he again criticized the trial. But the former US president wasn't the only
*08:04.040- 08:09.940* :  famous face talking to the media there. Hollywood star and New York native Robert DeNiro, who appeared
*08:09.940- 08:15.100* :  in a campaign ad for Joe Biden last week, turned up outside court and spoke to our correspondent
*08:15.100- 08:22.420* :  Nettael Feeck about the case. How concerned are you that he's going to be? I'm very concerned
*08:22.420- 08:27.280* :  because they don't play by fair rules. Publicans, they all came up here before and they were talking
*08:27.280- 08:32.300* :  your work clothes like him. It's crazy. We're in a crazy zone and that's because of Trump because
*08:32.300- 08:36.860* :  he's crazy. Sir, what if Trump is found guilty in this trial? We'll deal with that. Of course,
*08:36.860- 08:41.480* :  I've been concerned about it. Well, as we record this podcast, closing arguments are still
*08:41.480- 08:46.200* :  taking place as I heard from Netta. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is there
*08:46.620- 08:53.340* :  in person. Of course, this is perhaps the greatest trial of his career. And so that is why
*08:53.340- 08:58.720* :  closing arguments are taking a while. Prosecutors are laying out each exhibit,
*08:58.720- 09:05.680* :  each crucial piece of testimony and telling jurors why it corroborates their case that Donald
*09:05.680- 09:12.260* :  Trump tried to cover up election fraud by falsifying business documents and prosecutors at one point
*09:12.260- 09:18.120* :  even joking to the jury. I hope you're getting all of this. And what they have said is that Michael
*09:18.120- 09:24.760* :  Cohen, their star witness, is almost like a tour guide through the indisputable evidence they
*09:24.760- 09:31.260* :  have put forward. They say Donald Trump loomed over every decision on the alleged conspiracy
*09:31.420- 09:37.940* :  with Trump and a tabloid to help his campaign. They say that violated federal campaign finance
*09:37.940- 09:44.040* :  laws and could have been what got Donald Trump elected. And they said that the documents
*09:44.040- 09:51.080* :  showing the alleged cover-up were so damning that it was laughable that the defense said it didn't
*09:51.080- 09:57.880* :  show evidence of fraud. So prosecutors still making their case. This is, of course, their final
*09:57.880- 10:03.220* :  chance to convince jurors. Yeah, earlier, the defense had their final chance. What did they say?
*10:04.720- 10:09.760* :  Yeah, well, look, the defense tried to say that look, Donald Trump was in the White House. He
*10:09.760- 10:14.440* :  signed those checks, but he was actually busy running the country and didn't know how they would
*10:14.440- 10:20.940* :  be recorded in business records. But even if those records, you know, he did know about them,
*10:20.940- 10:26.040* :  there was nothing wrong with them. Donald Trump said he was just paying Michael Cohen for legitimate
*10:26.040- 10:34.020* :  legal work. But most of the argument was focused on Michael Cohen himself. They said he was the
*10:34.020- 10:39.900* :  human embodiment of reasonable doubt and the greatest liar of all time. And they said because of
*10:39.900- 10:46.100* :  that, they really couldn't, the jury, find that President Trump was guilty just based on the word
*10:46.100- 10:53.460* :  of Michael Cohen alone. Our correspondent, Ida Talfiq, outside the court in New York. A public inquiry
*10:53.460- 10:59.280* :  has begun in Kenya into allegations of abuse by the British army at a training base north of the
*10:59.280- 11:04.900* :  capital Nairobi. The accusations include murder, sexual assault and torture as Rachel Wright reports.
*11:05.500- 11:10.240* :  Up to 10,000 British troops are allowed to train in Kenya every year under an agreement the
*11:10.240- 11:15.960* :  country signed with the UK after it became independent. The base in the town of Nanuki was set up
*11:15.960- 11:22.240* :  in the 1960s. The public inquiry has begun hearing evidence from local people who accused some of
*11:22.240- 11:27.720* :  the British soldiers of murder, sexual abuse, torture and abusive power. In the most high
*11:27.720- 11:33.520* :  profile case, the body of a young Kenyan woman was found in a septic tank in Nanuki in 2012.
*11:33.660- 11:40.340* :  Agnes Wanjuru, who was 21, was last seen alive with a British soldier. Her family brought a legal
*11:40.340- 11:45.780* :  case in Kenya over her death, but hearings have been repeatedly postponed. The British High
*11:45.780- 11:50.880* :  Commission said it would be cooperating fully with the public inquiry. The chair of Kenya's
*11:50.880- 11:56.280* :  Parliamentary Defence Committee says the outcome could have serious consequences for the future of
*11:56.280- 12:01.000* :  the defence agreement between the two countries. Our Africa Regional Editor Rachel Wright.
*12:01.800- 12:07.160* :  A British cancer survivor diagnosed as a teenager has created a range of garments to support
*12:07.160- 12:13.080* :  other patients. Fashion design student Olivia Hodson was inspired by her own struggle to find
*12:13.080- 12:17.000* :  suitable clothing when she was ill. Stephanie Zacherson takes up her story.
*12:17.320- 12:23.240* :  Olivia Hodson was diagnosed with blood cancer at the age of 16, and as she was coming to terms with
*12:23.240- 12:28.700* :  her diagnosis and undergoing treatment, she quickly realised how hot it was to find clothes
*12:28.700- 12:32.700* :  that worked for her. I wanted to see them normal and not obviously
*12:32.700- 12:38.320* :  seem ill to everyone that I met, so I wanted to wear normal clothing, but all of the clothing that I
*12:38.320- 12:43.260* :  had and all of the clothing that I could find, it just was really inconvenient. It made my life
*12:43.260- 12:46.800* :  harder and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why I could wear the wooden
*12:46.800- 12:51.760* :  interfere with my medical devices, why I could wear that could deal with the changes that cancer
*12:51.760- 12:57.140* :  and treatment were making on my body. Olivia says a most clothing felt uncomfortable. It was irritating
*12:57.140- 13:02.540* :  her skin or pulling on her medical equipment, and the things she did find weren't particularly
*13:02.540- 13:08.820* :  fashionable or felt her age. The option of going to school in her pajamas didn't seem very appealing.
*13:09.140- 13:13.580* :  I was just really disappointed about how about the selection of clothing that exists,
*13:14.280- 13:19.020* :  and how about it just isn't thought about more, so I decided to design some myself.
*13:19.360- 13:25.640* :  So when Olivia a few years after her diagnosis started studying fashion, she knew what to focus on,
*13:25.640- 13:28.520* :  and a lot of thought has gone into her designs.
*13:28.800- 13:34.720* :  These are accesses definitely a big one. I've kind of narrowed down the main kind of access areas
*13:34.720- 13:38.860* :  and made sure that they're in one of the garments that I've designed. Comfort is a big one as well,
*13:38.860- 13:44.340* :  coverage and fabric choices are really important, so all the fabrics I've used, they're really soft
*13:44.360- 13:48.440* :  and they're good for sensitive skin and they're good for sun protection as well.
*13:48.780- 13:54.100* :  One of the items is a soft coat in bamboo and tweed. It's oversized to allow space for
*13:54.100- 13:58.920* :  catheter lines to be worn while undergoing chemotherapy. Another is a berry red
*13:58.920- 14:03.020* :  dress, loose and flowing, with buttons running down the front and shoulders,
*14:03.020- 14:08.660* :  enabling the dress to be opened in multiple ways. The fabric stretch and expand as bodyweight
*14:08.660- 14:12.620* :  can fluctuate while undergoing treatment, and they can be bloating because of steroids.
*14:13.260- 14:17.980* :  The buttons are mostly magnetic ones, making it easier for those with dexterity problems
*14:17.980- 14:22.780* :  to open and close them. Olivia says she's aimed for designs that won't go out of fashion.
*14:23.080- 14:28.720* :  So not too trend-based, so it can be long-lasting. Obviously there's a sustainability element to
*14:28.720- 14:34.040* :  it as well. Olivia's now finished a range of items as part of her final year project at Nottingham
*14:34.040- 14:39.200* :  Trent University, where they're part of the graduate display. Her hope is that the clothing can
*14:39.200- 14:44.880* :  improve cancer patients' confidence and perhaps that some fashion investors realise the need
*14:45.120- 14:49.200* :  for her designs. Yeah, that would definitely be great, that would be very exciting.
*14:50.080- 14:54.540* :  Olivia Hodson ending that report by Stephanie Zacherson, and if you look at the BBC website,
*14:55.020- 14:56.980* :  you can see some of Olivia's designs.
*15:00.240- 15:04.900* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. One of the things he said was the Olympics are just
*15:05.060- 15:08.380* :  a competition for me. They will end and after they end there will be another one,
*15:08.380- 15:14.140* :  so he still thinks he's got a lot to give. Can China superstar swimmer make a comeback after a
*15:14.140- 15:14.740* :  doping ban?

*16:30.640- 16:36.180* :  Peanuts are the most common food allergy in children and the third most common among adults,
*16:36.180- 16:42.180* :  and a peanut allergy can be fatal. For many years parents were told to avoid exposing babies
*16:42.180- 16:47.660* :  and young children to peanuts altogether, but that is now changing, with the seemingly counterintuitive
*16:47.660- 16:51.800* :  advice backed by science that giving babies and young children small amounts of peanuts
*16:51.800- 16:57.100* :  could offer lifetime protection against an allergy. The project coordinator is Dr. Gideon Lack,
*16:57.100- 17:00.000* :  professor of pediatric allergy at King's College London.
*17:00.520- 17:07.440* :  We built on the LEAP study, which enrolled 640 babies with eczema many years ago,
*17:07.440- 17:15.660* :  and they were randomized with 50% consumed peanut puffs or peanut butter from four months of age,
*17:16.120- 17:21.860* :  and the other 50% avoided peanuts, and we followed these children up to five years of age
*17:22.360- 17:26.580* :  and showed a marked protective effect against developing peanut allergy.
*17:27.420- 17:32.640* :  So we decided to follow this population now of this cohort of children
*17:33.260- 17:38.200* :  to see whether this protective effect would last into adolescence teenager.
*17:38.200- 17:43.640* :  And we followed these children who we had evaluated at five and six years of age
*17:44.100- 17:49.740* :  all the way to their 13th birthday, and we evaluated them for peanut allergy.
*17:50.240- 17:55.700* :  And we found that the protective effect of eating peanuts puffs and peanut butter
*17:55.700- 18:01.000* :  in the first few years of life remained, and they were almost completely protected against
*18:01.000- 18:07.100* :  developing peanut allergy. That's very encouraging, and this advice will now go up,
*18:07.100- 18:15.120* :  will it emphatically, to parents? Well, the advice has already gone out. I think the advice
*18:15.120- 18:20.920* :  could be improved upon. I don't think there's enough stress about early introduction of peanut,
*18:20.920- 18:28.160* :  and by early, I mean, as early as four months of life, especially in babies at risk,
*18:28.160- 18:32.940* :  who have eczema or dry skin, those are the babies with the highest risk of peanut allergy.
*18:33.380- 18:38.480* :  But even in the general population, babies should start eating peanuts well
*18:39.240- 18:48.700* :  before six months of age in order to benefit from this protection. And there are, to be
*18:48.700- 18:55.500* :  born in mind, they are about 14, 13 or 14,000 new cases of peanut allergy in the UK
*18:56.300- 19:01.440* :  for every birth cohort of babies born, and we can prevent the overwhelming majority
*19:01.440- 19:06.860* :  of those more than 10,000. So if this advice were implemented properly,
*19:07.640- 19:12.400* :  we could over time come close to eradicating peanut allergy.
*19:13.280- 19:16.540* :  So a kind of peanut butter vaccination, if you like.
*19:17.840- 19:22.240* :  In a sense, although one needs to remember this is, and it's a good analogy,
*19:22.240- 19:29.120* :  but this is a simple, cheap intervention. It's not a medication, it's a food,
*19:29.420- 19:34.680* :  which is incorporated as part of the diet. Dr Gillian Lack talking to Julian Marshall.
*19:35.400- 19:40.460* :  A BBC World Service investigation has revealed that children as young as five are working in the
*19:40.460- 19:47.120* :  fields in Egypt, picking Jasmine for a global perfume industry worth billions. Egyptian Jasmine
*19:47.120- 19:52.600* :  is one of the industry's most prized scents. The BBC investigation looked into supply chains
*19:52.600- 19:58.040* :  at the height of the Jasmine picking season in 2023 and found it was used in brands such as
*19:58.040- 20:03.620* :  Air in Beauty and Longcom. Bottles of perfume can sell for hundreds of dollars, but BBC Africa
*20:03.620- 20:08.120* :  I discovered children working through the night, often for less than a dollar a day.
*20:08.120- 20:13.320* :  The UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery said what the BBC had found
*20:13.340- 20:18.000* :  may constitute the worst form of child labour. Hababita reports.
*20:21.720- 20:26.280* :  It's three in the morning. Her five-year-old son Anas struggles to stay away,
*20:26.280- 20:33.100* :  but he verges him to keep picking. About half of the world's supply of Jasmine comes from Egypt.
*20:33.100- 20:38.060* :  It blooms at night and there are a few precious months to collect it in.
*20:39.140- 20:44.460* :  That time he was brought what she and her four children have gathered to a collection point
*20:44.460- 20:52.320* :  to be paid. 650 grams. For a kilogram you get paid 45 Egyptian pounds.
*20:52.800- 20:58.340* :  Four people working from before dawn until eight or nine to make that amount of money,
*20:58.340- 21:04.700* :  it won't even buy you a water mill. About a third of what Hiba earns goes to the owner of the
*21:04.700- 21:10.900* :  Jasmine field. It's not enough to live on, which is why she says she needs her children to pick
*21:10.900- 21:18.120* :  Jasmine. I'd have to work non-stop for a month to buy a kilo of meat. My husband works as well,
*21:18.120- 21:23.100* :  but he earns very little. If we didn't have the children picking for us, we wouldn't be able to
*21:23.100- 21:29.080* :  manage at all. In the summer of 2023, the BBC filmed in fields in the Algarbia region.
*21:29.660- 21:35.140* :  In four different locations, we found children and pickers picking Jasmine throughout the night.
*21:35.880- 21:39.820* :  Ahmad Shami was the lead producer of the BBC iInvestigation.
*21:40.400- 21:46.340* :  In this video, we can see an undercover reporter asking the children if they collect Jasmine
*21:46.340- 21:54.760* :  every day. And the child says, yes, the reporter asks how old they are. One says 14 and other says
*21:54.760- 22:02.380* :  he's 12 years old. It's illegal in Egypt for children under the age of 15 to work between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.
*22:03.500- 22:09.160* :  Tomoya Abokata is the United Nations special reporter on contemporary forms of slavery.
*22:09.760- 22:15.080* :  We showed Professor Abokata our findings. He said it suggested perfume brands were failing to
*22:15.080- 22:20.420* :  meet their own commitments to ethical sourcing. Looking at this footage, they are not actually doing
*22:20.420- 22:26.120* :  things that they are promised to do. These families may not have a choice but to rely on the
*22:26.120- 22:32.580* :  children to make money. There is no safety consideration. All of these are quite clear indicators of
*22:32.580- 22:36.540* :  the hazardous work which may constitute the worst form of child labour.
*22:36.800- 22:42.200* :  The billion-dollar global brands who use Egyptian Jasmine in their fragrances claim to have zero
*22:42.200- 22:47.860* :  tolerance or child labour throughout their multi-layered chain of supply. But the BBC has found
*22:47.860- 22:53.800* :  weaknesses in the auditing systems that they rely on. The auditors are only auditing what they're
*22:53.800- 22:59.420* :  paid to audit. Sarada Dush is a professor of law at Rutgers University in America.
*22:59.780- 23:06.700* :  That may not include the Jasmine fields. It may not include the price that is being paid for
*23:06.700- 23:11.620* :  the Jasmine. We put our findings to the perfume companies. Loreal said,
*23:11.900- 23:17.220* :  Loreal is actively committed to respecting the most protective internationally recognized human
*23:17.220- 23:21.800* :  rights standards. Despite our strong commitments and actions, we know that in certain parts of the
*23:21.800- 23:27.180* :  world where Loreal supplies operate, there are risks to our commitments being upheld. We never
*23:27.180- 23:32.340* :  request fragrance houses to go lower than the market price for ingredients at the expense of farmers.
*23:32.820- 23:33.860* :  Estelle Oder said,
*23:34.320- 23:38.980* :  We believe the rights of all children should be protected and we have contacted our suppliers to
*23:38.980- 23:44.520* :  investigate this very serious matter. We're taking action to gain better transparency and to work
*23:44.520- 23:51.800* :  toward improving the livelihoods of sourcing communities. Back in Egypt, he banned her children
*23:51.800- 23:58.220* :  arresting after a long night's work. You haven't seen everything. You should see us when the
*23:58.220- 24:04.920* :  grounds with the children have to crawl underneath in the mud and I cry for them but we have no other
*24:04.920- 24:10.920* :  choices. Heber, bitter with that report and you can hear more on the investigation perfume's dark
*24:10.920- 24:17.500* :  secret wherever you get your BBC podcasts. After weeks of intense negotiations, a political
*24:17.500- 24:23.360* :  outsider called Dick Schroff is set to become the next Dutch Prime Minister. A former intelligence
*24:23.360- 24:28.380* :  chief he was chosen after it became clear that the winner of November's election, far-right leader
*24:28.380- 24:33.660* :  Hidd Wilders, did not have enough support for the top job. Mr Schroff said he would be Prime Minister
*24:33.660- 24:36.980* :  all the people of the Netherlands and a holligan has the details.
*24:37.520- 24:43.580* :  It seems even the former head of the Dutch intelligence service did realise he was in the running.
*24:47.000- 24:52.840* :  I had no idea that I'd be standing here in front of you today so it's also a surprise for me.
*24:53.080- 24:59.660* :  Dick Schroff, speaking in his first appearance following the announcement, laid out his priorities as
*24:59.660- 25:05.000* :  Prime Minister, getting a grip on immigration and asylum, financial security for families and
*25:05.000- 25:12.960* :  farmers and international stability. As people prepare to cast their ballots in the European
*25:12.960- 25:18.100* :  Parliamentary elections next week, there's been much speculation about how well the populist
*25:18.100- 25:22.800* :  right will do. As we've just been hearing the far-right has recently won elections in the
*25:22.800- 25:28.540* :  Netherlands as well as in Italy. It also leads the polls in France, Austria and Belgium and has a
*25:28.540- 25:32.980* :  stake in the governments of Finland and Slovakia. But in recent days there's been some
*25:32.980- 25:39.140* :  falling out among populist groups. The German AFD party has been kicked out of one of the European
*25:39.140- 25:45.600* :  Parliament's populist right groupings, identity and democracy or ID. Sarah Hobolt is professor
*25:45.600- 25:50.920* :  of European politics at the London School of Economics. The AFD, they've been kicked out for being
*25:50.920- 25:57.700* :  too radical even for the far-right. So in particular Le Pen's National Rally in France have said that
*25:57.960- 26:02.240* :  after a number of scandals, including one where the lead candidate for the AFD will rather
*26:02.240- 26:07.880* :  compliment you about the SS, said, oh this is too much, you're no longer a member of the ID. So they
*26:07.880- 26:13.420* :  now are no longer part of that far-right grouping in the European Parliament. Now talk us through
*26:13.420- 26:18.720* :  the groupings in the European Parliament because you might have thought all the populist right far-right
*26:18.720- 26:24.800* :  parties would maximize their strength by being in one parliamentary group, but they're not.
*26:25.180- 26:29.620* :  I mean, no, there are two main groupings on the radical right. We have one more moderate of
*26:29.620- 26:35.280* :  the two is the national conservative European conservatives and reformists and that's today where
*26:35.280- 26:40.800* :  Italy's Georgia Malone said and Poland's law and justice party. And then we have this second group
*26:40.800- 26:47.080* :  where the AFD is no longer a member, but that's the more far-right ethno nationalist group and we have
*26:47.080- 26:52.380* :  Le Pen's National Rally, the Italian League of Party, Austrian Freedom Party, they're sitting in
*26:52.380- 27:00.380* :  that second group. One thing that has divided people on the right has been attitude to Russia and
*27:00.380- 27:07.380* :  Ukraine. What's going on on Russia in particular? There's a lot of things these parties have in common
*27:07.380- 27:12.920* :  where they can really work together and immigration policies and their opposition to policies and
*27:12.920- 27:18.120* :  climate change and their sort of general populist rhetoric, but as you say on Russia they're really
*27:18.120- 27:22.840* :  quite divided. So traditionally a number of these radical right-wing parties have been quite
*27:22.840- 27:29.180* :  open to dialogue and even quite friendly with Putin's Russia and that includes Le Pen in France
*27:29.180- 27:35.460* :  with her National Rally, Orban in Hungary with Fidesz and also the AFD in Germany. So these
*27:35.460- 27:41.200* :  parties have been critical of sanctions that we should encourage a peace deal between Russia and
*27:41.200- 27:47.080* :  Ukraine and also very critical of the EU's and European military assistance to Ukraine. But then
*27:47.080- 27:51.800* :  there's another set of radical right-wing parties like Poland's Law and Justice Party, of course,
*27:51.800- 27:58.000* :  right on the border with Russia and Italy's Georgie Malone, that take a very hard line anti-Putin
*27:58.000- 28:03.080* :  stance. And I think this is interesting when we look forward to potential coalitions with the
*28:03.080- 28:09.880* :  centre-right, because Fundaline, who's commission president and who belongs to the centrist EPP group,
*28:10.400- 28:17.020* :  she has said that she can only really work with parties that are also anti-Putin and pro-Ukraine.
*28:17.480- 28:22.560* :  And so that means he's sort of opening up the door to working with Malone, but saying, you know,
*28:22.740- 28:26.460* :  shutting the door to parties perhaps that take a more pro-Putin stance.
*28:27.160- 28:32.580* :  Zara Havolt's talking to Evan Davis. Now he was the first Chinese athlete to win an
*28:32.580- 28:38.620* :  Olympic gold in men's swimming. He's flying away. He's sprinting. He's absolutely sprinting like a
*28:38.620- 28:44.860* :  53 star. He knows what he's after. It's a gold medal again for China for Sunyan here in London.
*28:45.300- 28:51.000* :  Well, the world record is 1434.14. We haven't had a world record in the 1500 of the Olympics
*28:51.360- 28:55.280* :  in a long, long time. It's just nighting too. It's the fastest of all time.
*28:58.760- 29:02.060* :  One great reaction. He's overwhelmed by it.
*29:02.860- 29:09.280* :  Sunyan winning in style at the London 2012 Games. He went on to become China's most decorated swimmer,
*29:09.540- 29:15.080* :  but in 2020 he was suspended by the world anti-doping agency for refusing to complete
*29:15.080- 29:20.700* :  a doping test, and he was given a four-year ban. Sunyan has now completed that ban and says
*29:20.700- 29:25.360* :  he hopes to return to competition soon. I heard more about him and his fall from grace
*29:25.360- 29:32.040* :  from our China media analyst, Kerry Allen. Mr. Sun is a huge celebrity in China, and he has more
*29:32.040- 29:36.540* :  than 31 million followers on Weibo, which is China's equivalent to a platform like Facebook.
*29:36.540- 29:41.760* :  He was such a big superstar, and there was a lot of anger at the time when he was handed
*29:41.760- 29:46.560* :  this suspension. Lots of criticism of the world anti-doping agency, and people in the country
*29:46.560- 29:51.060* :  saying that they actually questioned the agency. So what they didn't believe he was achieved?
*29:51.540- 29:56.240* :  They didn't at all, and in fact, state media at the time were very, very critical of the ban.
*29:56.240- 30:01.020* :  They threw a lot of support behind him. There were people, though, that did actually question
*30:01.020- 30:06.480* :  this and suggested that he should stop fighting it. I mean, even though domestically in China,
*30:06.480- 30:12.180* :  he's very much held as a hero. There have been public spats with other freestyle swimmers.
*30:12.300- 30:17.040* :  There was one notable incident where an Australian swimmer called Mac Horton refused to
*30:17.040- 30:21.760* :  get on a podium with him when he won, and others have also engaged with this spat, and very
*30:21.760- 30:26.740* :  much throwing criticism towards Sun. One thing is that China has a no tolerance attitude towards
*30:26.740- 30:31.400* :  doping, but I think the reason that this was so controversial is that he refused to complete a
*30:31.400- 30:36.940* :  doping test back in 2018. So there were questions about whether there was even doping involved
*30:36.940- 30:43.080* :  in the first place. Nevertheless, he was given a four-year ban which he has now served, and over
*30:43.080- 30:48.160* :  that time he says he's had a chance to reflect. Absolutely. So a lot of people today in China have
*30:48.160- 30:53.040* :  been watching an interview that he's given with a popular news website, The Paper, in which he
*30:53.040- 30:58.080* :  spoke about how it was a dark time for him when he was originally given the ban. It was actually
*30:58.080- 31:02.820* :  originally an eight-year ban that was reduced to four years and three months on appeal,
*31:03.320- 31:07.680* :  and he said that he just carried on swimming during that time. He's now 32 years old,
*31:07.680- 31:10.920* :  and he said he still believes that he's got a lot of potential in him.
*31:11.100- 31:15.500* :  Yeah, he won't be able to compete at the Paris Olympics, but he is hoping to make it come back
*31:15.500- 31:19.720* :  after that. He is absolutely. In fact, one of the things he said was the Olympics are just
*31:19.920- 31:23.280* :  a competition for me. They will end, and after they end, there will be another one.
*31:23.640- 31:28.400* :  Chinese media are saying that they think, by the end of August, he might return to the national
*31:28.400- 31:32.780* :  swimming summer championships, so that might be his big comeback. But a lot of anticipation,
*31:32.780- 31:35.840* :  a lot of people in China are really closely watching this.
*31:36.320- 31:38.500* :  Oh, China, media analyst, Kerry Allen.
