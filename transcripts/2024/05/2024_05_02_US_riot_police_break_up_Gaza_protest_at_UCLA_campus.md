*01:19.060- 01:22.720* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.700- 01:28.880* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday 2 May, these are our main stories.
*01:28.880- 01:34.520* :  Right, police in Los Angeles move in to dismantle a pro-Palestinian protest on Gaza
*01:34.960- 01:36.680* :  at a university campus in Los Angeles.
*01:37.200- 01:40.460* :  The EU announces a billion-dollar package for Lebanon.
*01:40.980- 01:44.720* :  The Solomon Islands elects a new pro-bay jig in Prime Minister.
*01:45.820- 01:50.680* :  Also in this podcast, Britain's top computer scientist warns it's already too late
*01:50.680- 01:57.020* :  to stop AI influencing this year's elections in the US and UK. And...
*02:04.700- 02:06.680* :  He was known as the King of Twang.
*02:07.020- 02:11.960* :  The American rock and roll guitarist Dwayne Eddie has died at the age of 86.
*02:16.360- 02:20.640* :  As we record this podcast, it's the early eyes of the morning on the West Coast of America.
*02:21.160- 02:25.700* :  And after a stand-off, right police have entered a pro-Palestinian protest camp
*02:25.700- 02:29.660* :  at the University of California and Los Angeles known as UCLA.
*02:30.520- 02:33.920* :  The police began demolishing barricades and shifting the protesters
*02:34.320- 02:36.360* :  after they defied an order to disperse.
*02:36.560- 02:42.300* :  Similar protest camps against the Israeli war in Gaza have been dismantled at other US universities
*02:42.300- 02:45.260* :  in recent days, including in New York and Dallas.
*02:45.340- 02:50.260* :  Our correspondent Helena Humphrey described the moment the police operation got underway.
*02:50.740- 02:53.080* :  Police have broken through that perimeter.
*02:53.080- 02:56.200* :  They are dragging away the barricades.
*02:56.200- 02:59.520* :  You can hear what appears to be fireworks right now.
*03:00.080- 03:03.160* :  More of the California highway is all going in.
*03:03.620- 03:06.040* :  Those fireworks continuing to go off.
*03:06.580- 03:09.000* :  And it appears that they may be making some arrests.
*03:09.000- 03:13.520* :  Certainly, people appear to be coming out with their hands tied behind their back.
*03:13.520- 03:20.340* :  I can see one such protest at so far, at least being escorted away from the scene.
*03:20.340- 03:24.280* :  And now the police are starting to pull away metal barricades.
*03:24.280- 03:28.800* :  We know that plywood had been used as reinforcements throughout the course of the day.
*03:29.320- 03:33.940* :  And certainly, it appears to be some kind of turmoil going on right now
*03:33.940- 03:37.260* :  as police just cast away those barricades
*03:37.260- 03:41.540* :  that had been erected and reinforced throughout the course of the afternoon
*03:41.540- 03:43.380* :  as they move in from the other side.
*03:43.700- 03:47.820* :  Earlier, they had moved in from behind, we believe, essentially,
*03:47.820- 03:49.400* :  and then had since retreated.
*03:49.400- 03:51.240* :  But now they've come in from this other side.
*03:51.660- 03:58.220* :  And, you know, a significant opening now of this area where we believe a few hundred people
*03:58.220- 04:02.060* :  are still inside, despite those calls for them to disperse.
*04:02.640- 04:03.480* :  Helena Humphrey.
*04:03.900- 04:07.180* :  I got the latest from our North America correspondent, Emma Vidy,
*04:07.180- 04:08.780* :  who is also at the campus.
*04:09.180- 04:13.880* :  We're watching large number of officers gradually moving deeper and deeper into the
*04:13.880- 04:16.860* :  encampment. It seems like their tactics have been pretty successful.
*04:16.860- 04:19.900* :  They've cleared a large area of the encampment now at different points.
*04:19.900- 04:22.600* :  They're firing volleys of flashbang grenades,
*04:22.600- 04:26.400* :  loud bangs and the loud flashes to disrupt protesters
*04:26.660- 04:28.800* :  and other points circling groups of them
*04:28.940- 04:33.260* :  and corralling them into one side and allowing police to dismantle more tents
*04:33.260- 04:35.440* :  and remove more barricades.
*04:35.440- 04:39.240* :  We have been seeing some protesters led away with their hands tied,
*04:39.240- 04:43.160* :  cable tied, it seems behind their backs, but we're not sure really yet
*04:43.360- 04:46.240* :  how many exact arrests are being made and how many people
*04:46.720- 04:48.180* :  exactly are being detained.
*04:48.960- 04:53.140* :  Now, earlier on, some protesters told us that police were firing rubber bullets.
*04:53.520- 04:57.940* :  It's very difficult to see in all the chaos exactly what police tactics are being used
*04:58.480- 05:02.040* :  in that sense. Now, the protesters still left inside.
*05:02.040- 05:05.560* :  They all look pretty determined to keep resisting for as long as they can,
*05:05.580- 05:09.700* :  but police have made seemingly quite a lot of progress in the last hour
*05:10.160- 05:12.100* :  in clearing a big section of this encampment.
*05:12.580- 05:15.420* :  And what are people seeing to you there, but what's going on?
*05:16.500- 05:20.560* :  Well, depends who you ask. I mean, the protesters themselves, I mean, that they're angry.
*05:20.560- 05:24.920* :  They feel that they should have a right to be able to remain in their encampment
*05:24.920- 05:28.920* :  longer. They've been making various demands of the universities in terms of
*05:28.920- 05:33.140* :  cutting ties with Israel or businesses that do business with Israel.
*05:33.620- 05:37.520* :  Very similar to, of course, all the demands across the universities, across this wave of
*05:37.520- 05:42.020* :  protests that we've seen. But in each case, there's a tolerance level, which is a
*05:42.500- 05:46.720* :  larger or smaller in different states as to how long they'll leave these encampments set up.
*05:46.740- 05:50.200* :  And tonight was the moment that police moved in on the encampment here at UCLA.
*05:50.940- 05:55.000* :  Students outside who had nothing to do with these protests, of course, who we've been talking to.
*05:55.460- 05:59.780* :  Some feel sympathy with them. Others are quite frustrated that a lot of classes have been cancelled.
*05:59.780- 06:04.860* :  And particularly for some people who are sitting exams this week, they too feel the sort of frustration
*06:04.860- 06:08.300* :  about the disruptions. What would have been an important week for them?
*06:08.620- 06:12.200* :  I mean, looking at the pictures that are unfolding on the television screens here in the studio,
*06:12.200- 06:14.280* :  it looks like a very big police operation.
*06:15.380- 06:19.160* :  Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely massive. I walked around the whole perimeter of the encampment,
*06:19.160- 06:23.500* :  and at each point there were hundreds of officers in riot gear standing
*06:23.500- 06:28.460* :  ready at different points. And helicopters circling overhead, drones circling overhead.
*06:28.460- 06:32.660* :  It was obviously a very well coordinated operation. And at each point,
*06:32.660- 06:36.680* :  they've been sort of systematically going in and clearing sections of it.
*06:36.700- 06:39.420* :  And I think there you would think from the police's perspective,
*06:39.420- 06:42.700* :  they are achieving what they set out to this evening.
*06:42.700- 06:46.560* :  I'm not sure the protesters here quite knew what to expect.
*06:46.680- 06:50.140* :  When we were alongside of the encampment with the protesters,
*06:50.140- 06:53.860* :  they were tearing down barricades on one side, bringing them over to the other side,
*06:53.860- 06:57.180* :  desperately trying to sort of hold their position, if you like.
*06:57.180- 07:01.140* :  But it seems that I would take a guess in the next few hours.
*07:01.140- 07:05.460* :  They may well have cleared this entirely if things carry on the way they are at the moment.
*07:05.960- 07:07.500* :  Mavardi in Los Angeles.
*07:08.380- 07:14.400* :  Lebanon is a country stuck in an economic meltdown with 80% of its population living in poverty.
*07:14.400- 07:19.760* :  It's a situation exacerbated by a migrant crisis and the threat of war with Israel.
*07:20.300- 07:23.680* :  Now in a visit to the capital Beirut, the president of the EU Commission,
*07:23.680- 07:28.060* :  Asura Vonderlin, has announced a financial package worth a billion dollars.
*07:28.620- 07:35.540* :  We are here first and foremost to say that the European Union strongly supports Lebanon and its people.
*07:36.360- 07:40.280* :  And we want to reinforce our long-standing cooperation.
*07:41.500- 07:46.940* :  Today, we discussed how we can strengthen our political and economic relations
*07:47.980- 07:51.880* :  and support the security and stability of Lebanon.
*07:52.640- 07:55.720* :  More from our correspondent, Yuga Bachega, who's in Beirut.
*07:56.040- 08:02.160* :  This is a package of 1 billion euros to be spent in the next three years.
*08:02.160- 08:07.600* :  And this is money that is expected to be used to improve public services also to support
*08:07.600- 08:14.240* :  the security forces. Obviously, for five years, Lebanon has been in a severe economic crisis,
*08:14.240- 08:17.860* :  which has meant that the country has struggled to support public services.
*08:17.860- 08:22.840* :  But a lot of this money is to help Lebanon deal with Syrian refugees.
*08:22.840- 08:27.780* :  More than one and a half million Syrian refugees live here in Lebanon.
*08:27.780- 08:30.660* :  This has put a lot of pressure on services.
*08:30.660- 08:36.720* :  There's been a lot of tension as well between refugees and some parts of the population in some places.
*08:37.480- 08:42.140* :  And because of all of that, there's been a rise in the number of Syrians trying to reach Cyprus,
*08:42.340- 08:44.760* :  which is a member of the EU from Lebanon.
*08:44.760- 08:48.140* :  And I think this is an effort by the EU to try to tackle this problem.
*08:48.660- 08:52.880* :  And there are ongoing military exchanges, aren't there between Hezbollah and Israel on the
*08:52.940- 08:56.160* :  south of the country? What impact is that having on Lebanon?
*08:57.400- 08:59.340* :  Well, it is affecting the entire country.
*08:59.340- 09:04.020* :  More than 100,000 people have had to flee their homes along the border.
*09:04.380- 09:05.520* :  Crops have been destroyed.
*09:05.520- 09:11.300* :  There's been a lot of destruction in terms of houses, infrastructure in their part of the country.
*09:11.840- 09:16.380* :  And here in Beirut and some other parts of the country, you don't see tourists.
*09:17.080- 09:19.620* :  Tourism obviously is a vital sector of the economy.
*09:20.160- 09:24.460* :  And I think there's also the psychological impact on people here because nobody knows
*09:24.960- 09:25.860* :  what is going to happen.
*09:25.860- 09:28.640* :  So there is this uncertainty about the future.
*09:29.160- 09:33.440* :  Up until now, most of those attacks from Hezbollah and Israel have been limited
*09:33.940- 09:37.040* :  to the border region between Lebanon and Israel.
*09:37.040- 09:39.320* :  But there's always the risk of miscalculation.
*09:39.320- 09:42.540* :  Hezbollah says that there is a ceasefire in Gaza.
*09:42.540- 09:45.000* :  There will be a ceasefire here as well.
*09:45.000- 09:48.500* :  There's been a lot of diplomatic activity to try to come up with a deal.
*09:48.500- 09:49.800* :  The Americans have been involved.
*09:49.800- 09:55.140* :  But again, I don't think the situation is going to change here unless there is a ceasefire
*09:55.460- 09:56.980* :  or even the end of the war in Gaza.
*09:57.500- 10:01.800* :  Hugo Bacheca, the head of the United States military command in Africa,
*10:01.800- 10:05.400* :  says discussions are continuing with the authorities in Niger and Chad,
*10:05.800- 10:08.220* :  despite the fact that US troops have been withdrawing.
*10:08.360- 10:13.000* :  The Sahel region has suffered from persistent attacks by Islamic extremist groups.
*10:13.460- 10:15.580* :  And in recent months, countries across the area,
*10:15.920- 10:20.300* :  including those under a military rule, have been turning to Russia for military cooperation
*10:20.760- 10:22.420* :  instead of to Western allies.
*10:23.020- 10:24.360* :  Chris Awakar reports.
*10:38.460- 10:43.280* :  The head of the US Africa command said this was a temporary withdrawal.
*10:44.080- 10:49.220* :  General Michael Langley also said discussions were continuing with the military in Niger.
*10:49.960- 10:55.200* :  Like military-run Mali, Niger has forced US, French and UN troops to leave,
*10:55.200- 10:59.820* :  and has also turned to Moscow for help against the Islamist extremist groups.
*11:00.580- 11:06.020* :  Some analysts suggest this switch of allegiance is at least partly aimed at protecting the
*11:06.020- 11:07.020* :  military regimes.
*11:07.660- 11:11.200* :  Chris Awakar, India's general election is underway,
*11:11.200- 11:16.540* :  and among those heading to the polls will be 18 million new first-time voters.
*11:17.020- 11:19.800* :  So what are the most pressing election issues for them?
*11:19.980- 11:23.540* :  As Arthasya Correspondent, Sameer Hussain has been speaking to young people
*11:23.540- 11:25.660* :  in two different parts of the country.
*11:26.520- 11:27.760* :  Okay, so should I try it?
*11:27.760- 11:30.320* :  Should I take a sip first and then see if I like it?
*11:30.960- 11:31.140* :  Okay.
*11:31.780- 11:32.740* :  Oh, that's tasty.
*11:33.280- 11:37.980* :  I'm with first-time voters here in Kerala sitting next to the beach
*11:38.280- 11:45.100* :  and we're drinking coconut water and I want to understand what are the most important issues
*11:45.860- 11:47.140* :  for first-time voters here.
*11:47.500- 11:49.780* :  We're losing this thing between communities.
*11:49.780- 11:53.040* :  We're losing the secularism that we are proud of in our constitution.
*11:53.140- 11:56.080* :  So I want to maintain what we used to be.
*11:56.420- 12:01.140* :  Important to me is to provide more job opportunities in our country.
*12:01.540- 12:04.320* :  How do you guys get your news?
*12:05.120- 12:05.920* :  Local TV channels.
*12:06.320- 12:07.260* :  Instagram Facebook.
*12:08.280- 12:09.740* :  Instagram social media sites like that.
*12:10.300- 12:14.000* :  I prefer following journalists on Instagram who have credibility.
*12:14.000- 12:19.660* :  Can you tell me what is it that you would like to see changed in this country?
*12:19.960- 12:22.740* :  We want to change the caste discrimination in the country.
*12:23.180- 12:24.120* :  That's the main problem.
*12:24.640- 12:27.700* :  I don't want them to fight in our caste, religion and all that stuff.
*12:27.700- 12:29.060* :  I want them fighting for money.
*12:29.360- 12:32.580* :  You see, that's when the economy grows and I believe that's what's needed.
*12:32.820- 12:35.940* :  One side you see a lot of rich people flaunting in their caste,
*12:35.940- 12:39.220* :  you know, just very big cities like Mumbai etc.
*12:39.880- 12:42.040* :  And then while you're in cities like that,
*12:42.040- 12:43.940* :  you see children coming into the road.
*12:43.940- 12:47.780* :  They're, you know, knocking on your windows and asking for money.
*12:47.860- 12:51.180* :  There are slums and there's right besides that there are, you know,
*12:51.660- 12:52.760* :  big rich people living.
*12:52.760- 12:56.240* :  So there's a big difference between in the same place.
*12:56.400- 13:00.800* :  So that's some of what we're hearing from first-time voters in Kerala.
*13:00.840- 13:05.040* :  I've now come to Bihar, which is in North India.
*13:05.300- 13:06.860* :  We're in the capital of Bhatna.
*13:07.060- 13:13.040* :  And I'm with a few first-time voters here to get a sense of what the issues are for them
*13:13.040- 13:15.120* :  and whether there are any differences.
*13:15.660- 13:18.880* :  The major issue that we are having in this country is employment.
*13:18.880- 13:24.540* :  I feel like I should have an option to just work in the city that I was born in.
*13:24.660- 13:27.260* :  They should not just set their offices in the main cities.
*13:27.740- 13:30.960* :  As a woman who's traveling regularly on public transport,
*13:30.960- 13:32.360* :  I think safety should be there.
*13:32.680- 13:33.740* :  You're always on guard.
*13:33.960- 13:35.880* :  Last month I'd say there was a guy.
*13:35.880- 13:40.020* :  He was like tingling behind my thighs and I slapped that guy.
*13:40.580- 13:41.340* :  Like what was that?
*13:41.340- 13:45.700* :  Sometimes you just want to be free and put your earphones on and just go home without thinking,
*13:45.700- 13:47.840* :  like what the other person's sitting beside me doing.
*13:48.380- 13:52.040* :  So I want that to women to feel safe and they can travel safely.
*13:52.940- 13:54.940* :  There should be more women political leaders.
*13:54.940- 13:59.920* :  She will actually provide at least some mental peace to women.
*14:00.700- 14:01.500* :  Yeah, I agree.
*14:01.500- 14:06.420* :  I think it's high time that we should start educating boys on how to behave and how to sit.
*14:06.420- 14:11.120* :  Do you think the politicians care about things like education and unemployment?
*14:11.800- 14:12.460* :  Yes, definitely.
*14:12.500- 14:13.800* :  They discuss about it.
*14:13.800- 14:16.040* :  They do research about it.
*14:16.600- 14:18.920* :  But working is something that they are not doing.
*14:19.040- 14:23.220* :  I want to know where do all of you get your news from?
*14:23.540- 14:25.140* :  Your channel's newspaper.
*14:25.740- 14:26.340* :  Social media?
*14:26.600- 14:27.480* :  Social media Instagram.
*14:27.800- 14:29.580* :  Social media is the biggest source, by the way.
*14:30.000- 14:30.860* :  Why social media?
*14:31.080- 14:31.980* :  Like what's up with that?
*14:32.160- 14:34.320* :  It's like where we spend most of our time on.
*14:34.680- 14:37.520* :  You get your information more easily and quickly.
*14:37.960- 14:38.800* :  Like one tap away.
*14:38.800- 14:39.860* :  It's just one click away.
*14:40.000- 14:42.120* :  One click away to the desired info you want.
*14:43.660- 14:48.440* :  As well as India, there will also be elections this year in the UK and the US.
*14:49.040- 14:51.380* :  But according to one of Britain's top computer scientists,
*14:51.380- 14:56.260* :  there's a serious risk that artificial intelligence could be misused to influence the outcome.
*14:56.540- 15:01.440* :  Professor Dame Wendy Hall told the BBC that voters will have to be on their guard
*15:01.440- 15:05.860* :  against convincing deep fakes of politicians shared on social media.
*15:06.380- 15:10.640* :  There's deep fakes that are coming out now, particularly those that are using
*15:10.640- 15:13.240* :  in generative AI, which is quite hard to do.
*15:13.560- 15:15.380* :  It's not off the shelf technology at the moment.
*15:15.960- 15:19.400* :  They're very mature and it's very difficult to tell technically,
*15:19.920- 15:23.160* :  or even looking at them, whether it's a fake or not.
*15:23.760- 15:26.840* :  The official campaigns need to put their stamp on things.
*15:27.840- 15:31.840* :  We will get watermarking over time and we will get technology that will help with this,
*15:31.940- 15:33.960* :  but not in time for this year's elections.
*15:33.960- 15:37.260* :  So social media, of course, amplify these things.
*15:37.740- 15:41.560* :  And we need to have a public awareness campaign about, you know,
*15:41.680- 15:45.060* :  being very careful about what information they trust.
*15:46.000- 15:49.080* :  For more, I spoke to our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman.
*15:49.420- 15:54.500* :  Well, she's right, isn't she? There's no magic off button for the misuse of AI.
*15:54.500- 15:58.760* :  Let's start with a look at a non-political story that we saw in the last few weeks.
*15:58.760- 16:02.720* :  There were some fake images of Taylor Swift that went viral online.
*16:02.740- 16:06.880* :  And in the end, so many people were looking at them and sharing them and reposting them,
*16:07.160- 16:13.300* :  that the platform X, formerly Twitter had to block all searches of her across the whole platform
*16:13.300- 16:14.640* :  to stop people from finding it.
*16:14.640- 16:17.140* :  Now clearly, that's not possible, is it?
*16:17.180- 16:19.200* :  On a sort of grand political scale.
*16:19.560- 16:23.260* :  And there's a really interesting bit of research done by Stanford University in the US.
*16:23.260- 16:29.180* :  They showed a group a series of statements and about a quarter of them believed those statements.
*16:29.200- 16:33.960* :  Without seeing anything else, they spent up to about 40% when they saw the statements.
*16:34.020- 16:37.780* :  And they also saw some disinformation that had been written by humans.
*16:38.440- 16:42.540* :  And that figure went up to 53% of them who believed it when they saw the statements.
*16:42.600- 16:45.420* :  And they also saw disinformation that had been written by AI
*16:45.940- 16:47.340* :  and then tweaked by students.
*16:47.480- 16:50.860* :  And the AI tool that they used was one that we all got access to.
*16:50.860- 16:52.040* :  It was chat GPT.
*16:52.660- 16:58.360* :  So that's the power of how influential this material and content can be.
*16:58.880- 17:00.380* :  So what's been done to counter it?
*17:01.220- 17:03.740* :  It is a really difficult game of cat and mouse.
*17:03.780- 17:05.560* :  And of course, it's been going on for a long time.
*17:05.560- 17:10.160* :  You know what we're seeing here is an old world problem playing out with a set of very new tools.
*17:10.760- 17:15.260* :  Meta in particularly which owns Facebook and Instagram is telling genuine political
*17:15.260- 17:19.120* :  campaigners that they have to flag their content if they are using AI themselves.
*17:19.180- 17:23.620* :  Because let's not forget, it is genuinely being used for authentic reasons as well.
*17:23.960- 17:26.660* :  There are also tech tools, the social networks,
*17:26.660- 17:29.220* :  the building which can recognise this content.
*17:29.700- 17:32.360* :  And of course, on top of all of that, we've got regulations.
*17:32.420- 17:38.460* :  So lots of countries are considering or even bringing in strict rules about social media
*17:38.460- 17:39.460* :  and what's shared on it.
*17:39.600- 17:41.720* :  In the UK, we have the Online Safety Act.
*17:42.060- 17:46.220* :  And that forces social networks to remove disinformation as soon as they're made aware of it.
*17:46.540- 17:49.040* :  And the penalties for that are very, very big fines.
*17:49.140- 17:53.640* :  But I don't think there's any way certainly at this stage to put that genie back in the bottle.
*17:54.240- 17:56.700* :  And just thinking about this myself, I mean,
*17:56.700- 18:01.700* :  is there anything that if you're looking at anything on social media,
*18:02.120- 18:07.360* :  is there any pointer that you should look out for which might suggest if something is fake or not?
*18:08.420- 18:11.260* :  I wish I could give you three top tips.
*18:11.300- 18:15.800* :  But the fact is that this technology is getting so good that it's getting harder.
*18:16.140- 18:19.660* :  Deepfake videos, the eyes didn't used to blink now, they do.
*18:19.660- 18:22.980* :  Deepfake audio, you didn't used to hear a person taking a breath.
*18:23.500- 18:24.140* :  Now you do.
*18:24.520- 18:25.600* :  You can do little things.
*18:25.600- 18:27.320* :  Sometimes you could have a look at the background.
*18:27.320- 18:31.440* :  Sometimes if an image has been rendered or a video has been rendered by artificial intelligence,
*18:31.440- 18:33.560* :  what's in the background can be less polished.
*18:34.000- 18:39.080* :  If you're looking at video, watch the mouth, see if it perfectly syncs with the audio that you're hearing.
*18:39.560- 18:42.560* :  But honestly, these are not 100% foolproof.
*18:42.560- 18:46.560* :  So I think a vote is this year, which is apparently half of the world, isn't it?
*18:46.660- 18:48.480* :  I'm going to have to really be on their guard.
*18:49.280- 18:50.020* :  So, a climber.
*18:51.780- 18:52.320* :  Still to come.
*18:53.040- 18:56.660* :  She was older when she died, so her teeth were really worn down.
*18:56.660- 19:00.080* :  I mean, the teeth at the front, she's got no crown left to the white part.
*19:00.460- 19:04.340* :  She had gum disease and the gums would have been starting to recess.
*19:04.380- 19:08.100* :  We can see also things like signs of arthritis in her neck.
*19:08.740- 19:15.340* :  Scientists recreate the face of a Neanderthal woman 75,000 years after her death.
*19:22.200- 19:23.880* :  So, how do we get AI right?
*19:24.320- 19:28.480* :  Well, we need the right volume of data, the software to train it,
*19:28.800- 19:31.580* :  and massive compute power, or...
*19:37.020- 19:42.380* :  But with HPE GreenLake, we get access to supercomputing to power AI at the scale we need,
*19:42.540- 19:44.000* :  helping generate better insights.
*19:47.240- 19:48.040* :  Nice teamwork, guys.
*19:48.700- 19:49.760* :  Search HPE GreenLake.
*19:52.340- 19:56.720* :  Life's less ordinary brings you remarkable personal stories from across the globe.
*19:56.720- 20:01.460* :  From people who chased their dreams, no one knew that I was going to travel by bike.
*20:01.820- 20:04.420* :  If I had told them that I was riding a bike to Egypt,
*20:04.420- 20:09.480* :  they might have seen that it was impossible to people who've lived through nightmares.
*20:09.980- 20:11.440* :  Been in jail in Thailand.
*20:11.440- 20:15.300* :  I made a promise to myself in that jail that when I'm home,
*20:15.300- 20:16.940* :  I'm going to volunteer somewhere.
*20:17.320- 20:19.920* :  Life's less ordinary from the BBC World Service.
*20:20.340- 20:22.660* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*20:33.140- 20:37.020* :  Politicians in the Solomon Islands have chosen a new Prime Minister who's in favor of
*20:37.020- 20:38.800* :  closer ties with China.
*20:38.800- 20:42.440* :  Jeremiah Manelli, one a vote by fellow members of Parliament,
*20:42.440- 20:46.760* :  his main opponent, wanted to curb Beijing's influence in the Pacific.
*20:46.760- 20:51.760* :  The contest took place after a general election last month failed to produce a clear winner.
*20:52.280- 20:55.540* :  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor Mickey Bristo told me more.
*20:55.920- 20:59.360* :  The main reason that we're talking about him and the main reason that most people across the
*20:59.360- 21:03.240* :  world are interested in is the international relations aspect of this story.
*21:03.240- 21:08.780* :  The Solomon Islands subject to create power rivalry between China, the United States and Australia.
*21:09.300- 21:11.560* :  Mr Manelli favors China.
*21:11.560- 21:17.920* :  So two years ago, the Solomon Islands signed a controversial security pact with Beijing.
*21:17.920- 21:22.320* :  Mr Manelli was part of the administration which drew close to China.
*21:22.920- 21:28.020* :  And so it's expected that now he will maintain that close relationship with Beijing.
*21:28.540- 21:30.760* :  But of course, you're asking what kind of person he is.
*21:31.120- 21:34.360* :  People in the Solomon Islands act just concerned about international relations.
*21:34.360- 21:38.160* :  The economy he spoke about, that, getting that going, mining, logging.
*21:38.560- 21:43.900* :  Not so improving the health and education for people, for nearly a million people who live in
*21:43.900- 21:48.040* :  the Solomon Islands. A lot of them spread out across hundreds of small islands.
*21:48.040- 21:52.700* :  So very specific issues facing this country which he's going to tackle.
*21:53.000- 21:57.560* :  And what are the implications of his stance for the wider region?
*21:58.440- 22:02.480* :  It's just going back to what I said there at the beginning about the relationship with China.
*22:02.860- 22:06.760* :  The Solomon Islands, not just the Solomon Islands, but also other Pacific nations,
*22:06.760- 22:11.740* :  really come under pressure from other bigger nations because of this great power rivalry.
*22:12.340- 22:14.720* :  They see the Pacific as an area to compete.
*22:14.720- 22:18.980* :  And in some respects, these smaller countries have been, if not victims,
*22:18.980- 22:22.060* :  then certainly at the center of this power struggle.
*22:22.060- 22:26.780* :  So at the moment, this election won't really change that power balance.
*22:26.780- 22:32.620* :  However, the new Prime Minister has a reputation of being a conciliatory kind of character.
*22:32.620- 22:35.620* :  So he's probably going to maintain good relations with Beijing,
*22:35.620- 22:40.800* :  but also have better relations with Australia and the United States and his predecessors.
*22:40.800- 22:45.400* :  So perhaps not a great change in the foreign policy of this region.
*22:45.660- 22:48.980* :  I mean, interesting how he's asked people, appeal to people to accept the result.
*22:49.980- 22:53.680* :  Yeah, there has been a lot of violence in the Solomon's over previous years,
*22:54.200- 22:55.120* :  particularly following elections.
*22:55.120- 22:59.260* :  It was violence a few years ago about this switch towards China.
*22:59.880- 23:04.140* :  And so that appeal there is about for people to just accept the result.
*23:04.140- 23:07.800* :  Let's get on and try and sort some of the problems out in the Solomon Islands.
*23:08.360- 23:11.160* :  And we expect he's hoping to forget about foreign policy altogether.
*23:12.060- 23:12.560* :  Mickey Bristol.
*23:13.460- 23:17.740* :  India's food regulator has ordered nationwide inspections of companies
*23:17.740- 23:21.420* :  making spice mixes, following allegations that two brands,
*23:21.420- 23:24.400* :  popular overseas, had problems with contamination.
*23:25.100- 23:26.840* :  More from Anbarathan Etheragen.
*23:27.300- 23:32.320* :  Officials in India have been ordered to carry out testing of all the manufacturing units
*23:32.320- 23:38.300* :  for powdered spices with a focus on those making curry powders and mixed spice blends.
*23:38.840- 23:44.060* :  Food safety inspectors in Hong Kong last month suspended sales of three spice blends
*23:44.060- 23:50.520* :  made by MDH and another by Everest over allegedly high levels of ethylene oxide,
*23:50.520- 23:52.420* :  a cancer-causing chemical.
*23:52.420- 23:57.900* :  Singapore also ordered a recall of the same Everest spice mixed for fish curry.
*23:58.340- 24:01.940* :  The two companies have said the products are safe for consumption.
*24:02.780- 24:04.240* :  Anbarathan Etheragen.
*24:04.980- 24:09.120* :  The number of BBC World Service journalists working in exile is estimated to have nearly
*24:09.120- 24:12.360* :  doubled in the past four years to 310.
*24:12.380- 24:17.160* :  The figures released for the first time ahead of world press freedom day reflect the
*24:17.160- 24:22.260* :  growing challenges journalists face in countries like Russia, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.
*24:23.020- 24:27.120* :  Some journalists, including those from Iran, have lived abroad for more than a decade.
*24:27.720- 24:30.760* :  Stephanie Huggity's book to some of those facing death threats,
*24:30.760- 24:34.860* :  harassment, and jail sentences just for doing their job.
*24:35.280- 24:39.640* :  My husband and I bought the cheapest airplane tickets outside of Russia.
*24:39.820- 24:43.880* :  And we didn't actually pick an destination in particular, just out.
*24:44.080- 24:46.440* :  Nina Nazarova works for BBC Russian.
*24:46.440- 24:51.340* :  And how to leave her home following the full scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.
*24:55.260- 24:57.100* :  BBC News at 6 o'clock.
*24:57.100- 25:00.780* :  The BBC has temporarily suspended its operations in Russia.
*25:00.980- 25:06.260* :  My husband and I took two suitcases, our son and his stroller and left.
*25:06.700- 25:11.540* :  When our plane was taken off, my husband looked outside the plane window and actually
*25:11.860- 25:13.700* :  cried and I just went numb.
*25:14.520- 25:19.180* :  It was the 4th of March and a new censorship law had come into effect in Russia.
*25:19.580- 25:24.560* :  And after that, I could face up to 15 years in prison just for doing my job.
*25:24.760- 25:29.380* :  In April this year, her colleague, BBC Russian correspondent Ilya Burabanov,
*25:29.640- 25:31.240* :  was labelled as a foreign agent.
*25:31.240- 25:35.080* :  Ilya and the BBC reject the decision and are disputing it in court.
*25:35.080- 25:39.520* :  But Ilya, Nina, and their team now live in the Latvian capital Riga.
*25:39.920- 25:42.820* :  And like 310 other BBC world service staff,
*25:42.820- 25:44.960* :  they may never be able to go home.
*25:45.240- 25:48.080* :  It's been difficult first few years.
*25:48.080- 25:52.960* :  It was more difficult because you think all the time that I want to go back,
*25:52.960- 25:55.080* :  you feel that you can go back.
*25:55.080- 26:00.680* :  Farnas Gazizade, a presenter for BBC Persian, hasn't been home to Iran in 21 years.
*26:01.060- 26:07.320* :  My dad, when he was alive, they summoned him regularly to threaten him.
*26:07.320- 26:11.700* :  They told them that they know where our children's schools are.
*26:11.700- 26:15.860* :  Recently, she learned by chance, after a hack on the Iranian judiciary,
*26:15.860- 26:19.860* :  that she and nine of her colleagues have been sentenced to a year in prison.
*26:20.000- 26:21.380* :  I dream about going back.
*26:21.420- 26:25.620* :  I try not to think about it because it can destroy you.
*26:25.860- 26:28.880* :  In 2022, when her brother fell seriously ill,
*26:29.060- 26:30.560* :  Farnas was desperate to get home.
*26:30.920- 26:32.620* :  He died six weeks later.
*26:32.820- 26:37.480* :  And then six months on my father's pass, still I am struggling with,
*26:37.820- 26:42.940* :  that I really wanted to be there for my family, for my mother, and I couldn't be there.
*26:43.140- 26:48.020* :  For Shazia Hayah from BBC Pashto, life in exile is also laced with guilt.
*26:48.660- 26:51.760* :  She was evacuated to the UK alone in 2022,
*26:52.440- 26:54.300* :  when the Taliban took control in Afghanistan,
*26:54.960- 26:56.880* :  leaving her parents and her brother in Kabul.
*26:57.320- 26:59.200* :  I mean, I can't explain the night.
*27:00.040- 27:02.520* :  I left home around 2 a.m.
*27:02.980- 27:06.360* :  I didn't know why I couldn't hug my younger brother.
*27:07.660- 27:09.180* :  And I'm regretting that.
*27:10.040- 27:11.100* :  My brother is not free.
*27:11.760- 27:13.200* :  I'm free in here, but he is not.
*27:13.660- 27:15.020* :  The committee to protect journalists.
*27:15.200- 27:17.900* :  He's risks increasing for journalists globally.
*27:17.900- 27:20.160* :  Jody Ginsburg is their CEO.
*27:20.480- 27:25.060* :  It is much worse for journalists than it has been for a very long time.
*27:25.060- 27:27.760* :  We've got near record numbers of journalists in jail,
*27:28.400- 27:32.480* :  the killing of journalists reached a high, not seen since 2015,
*27:32.520- 27:36.420* :  and many colleagues report ongoing harassment.
*27:36.420- 27:38.860* :  To be honest with you, I watch my back.
*27:38.900- 27:40.880* :  I have a lot of security camera around my house.
*27:41.060- 27:43.640* :  Tiagole is a correspondent for BBC Persian.
*27:43.820- 27:44.920* :  And even I was warned,
*27:45.280- 27:47.200* :  it would be smart to change my daughter's school.
*27:47.280- 27:49.960* :  In March, a presenter for the independent broadcaster,
*27:49.960- 27:52.720* :  Iran International, was stabbed in the leg,
*27:53.020- 27:54.260* :  outside his London home,
*27:54.540- 27:55.740* :  and British counterterrorism,
*27:55.740- 27:57.600* :  police have warned of an increased threat
*27:58.040- 28:00.120* :  to BBC Persian staff in the UK.
*28:00.340- 28:05.020* :  My grave worry is one day, she will be without father.
*28:05.200- 28:06.940* :  My wife passed away, and so my gosh,
*28:06.980- 28:08.020* :  if something happened to me,
*28:08.260- 28:10.040* :  what can happen to my daughter?
*28:10.580- 28:12.900* :  That's something is really in the back of my mind,
*28:12.900- 28:14.480* :  always. I'm more cautious.
*28:15.000- 28:17.200* :  He hasn't been to Iran since 2007.
*28:17.260- 28:19.720* :  When his mother died, he snuck over the border
*28:20.040- 28:20.880* :  to visit her grave.
*28:21.740- 28:22.760* :  He didn't go to her funeral.
*28:23.960- 28:27.040* :  But what many of these journalists find even more frustrating
*28:27.040- 28:29.820* :  is having to report on their countries from afar.
*28:30.120- 28:32.560* :  And as journalists, covering what's happening at home,
*28:32.700- 28:35.780* :  they're inextricably linked to the places they've had to leave.
*28:36.020- 28:38.480* :  And you cannot really leave your life feeling that,
*28:38.600- 28:41.060* :  okay, I am British now, I'm leaving this country.
*28:41.620- 28:42.800* :  This is not how it works.
*28:43.080- 28:45.860* :  You're in exile and still you're there.
*28:46.880- 28:50.380* :  Fun as Ghazizade ending that report by Stephanie Heggerti.
*28:51.060- 28:53.420* :  Scientists at Cambridge University have recreated
*28:53.420- 28:57.900* :  the face of a Neanderthal woman who lived 75,000 years ago.
*28:58.100- 29:03.040* :  The life-like model was built from a crushed skull discovered in a cave in Kurdistan,
*29:03.560- 29:07.860* :  where the remains of at least 10 Neanderthals have been found since the 1950s.
*29:08.420- 29:13.380* :  Scientists think she may have been in her mid-40s a considerable age at that point.
*29:13.960- 29:19.160* :  James Coppnell spoke to Dr. Emma Pomeroy, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Cambridge,
*29:19.520- 29:20.560* :  who worked on the project.
*29:21.100- 29:24.740* :  Our role here was in making the physical reconstruction of the skull.
*29:25.340- 29:28.520* :  And then the Kennis Brothers, who are fabulous paleo artists,
*29:28.520- 29:31.840* :  have done the reconstruction of what she would have looked like during life.
*29:32.440- 29:35.220* :  But just to reconstruct the skull was a huge challenge.
*29:35.220- 29:37.220* :  It was completely crushed.
*29:37.220- 29:41.240* :  It was about two centimetres thick in total and highly fragmented.
*29:41.660- 29:42.980* :  The bone was very soft.
*29:43.440- 29:47.120* :  So we had to remove the bone from the ground in small packages
*29:47.780- 29:50.880* :  and then very carefully clean that in the lab.
*29:51.260- 29:54.920* :  Other consultant, which is kind of like a glue that helps to stabilise the bone
*29:54.920- 29:56.420* :  and make it strong enough to work with.
*29:56.960- 30:03.040* :  And then set about the quite daunting task of physically fitting those bits of the bone back together.
*30:03.820- 30:09.120* :  What does this then reveal about the person who died so many years ago?
*30:09.900- 30:13.980* :  We're learning a lot from the skull itself, and this is actually work that's ongoing.
*30:13.980- 30:16.360* :  But we can already say, well, we know that she's female.
*30:17.040- 30:19.080* :  We can also say that she was older when she died.
*30:19.080- 30:21.700* :  So her teeth were really worn down.
*30:21.700- 30:25.160* :  I mean, the teeth at the front, she's got no crown left to the white part.
*30:25.660- 30:27.960* :  They're worn right down to little stubs of the roots.
*30:28.840- 30:30.460* :  We could also learning about her health.
*30:30.480- 30:35.720* :  So for example, she had gum disease and the gums would have been starting to recess.
*30:35.740- 30:39.460* :  We can see also things like signs of arthritis in her neck.
*30:40.220- 30:43.440* :  So very exciting to start learning about this person.
*30:43.980- 30:46.940* :  The physical reconstruction, so what she would have looked like in life
*30:47.480- 30:51.500* :  is also quite fascinating, because I think it helps us to think of her as a person
*30:51.540- 30:55.080* :  and brings up some different questions about what she might have been like
*30:55.080- 30:56.800* :  and what her life might have been like.
*30:57.200- 31:02.340* :  And other things that have surprised you then in this work over the last couple of years?
*31:03.560- 31:04.960* :  Yes, I mean, various things.
*31:05.000- 31:11.540* :  One of the most interesting points, I think, is that Shandar Zed is actually part of a really tight
*31:11.540- 31:15.280* :  cluster of Neanderthal individuals found in the cave.
*31:15.820- 31:20.860* :  And that's very intriguing because the cave is huge and yet within sort of a meter and a half
*31:20.880- 31:26.620* :  by a meter by 50 centimeters deep, we've got the remains of at least five individuals.
*31:26.620- 31:29.200* :  So that starts raising questions.
*31:29.280- 31:32.400* :  I don't think it can be coincidence in such a big space.
*31:33.120- 31:35.700* :  So does this have some kind of meaning?
*31:35.700- 31:37.480* :  Are they returning to that same spot?
*31:37.980- 31:42.820* :  And actually we're getting some evidence that the bodies were brought there or placed there
*31:43.260- 31:44.220* :  at different times.
*31:44.920- 31:49.580* :  So again, it raises this question of whether Neanderthal had sort of special places
*31:50.400- 31:54.120* :  and how they thought about death and the landscape around them.
*31:54.640- 32:00.920* :  I mean, would that suggest a sort of more empathy, emotion than one might have associated with Neanderthals?
*32:01.780- 32:02.780* :  Yes, absolutely.
*32:02.780- 32:06.520* :  So I mean, from sort of the earliest days back to the 19th century,
*32:06.520- 32:12.420* :  where Neanderthals were first identified, there was this idea that they were sort of your archetypal
*32:12.760- 32:19.100* :  cavemen, not very intelligent and not capable of things like compassion and very complex emotions.
*32:20.020- 32:22.620* :  But in more recent years, that idea has been challenged.
*32:22.760- 32:27.560* :  And actually the finds here from Shandar Cave have been really instrumental in that.
*32:27.680- 32:35.080* :  And the new finds will play an important part in us trying to understand their capacity for
*32:35.700- 32:37.540* :  compassion and how they might have dealt with death.
*32:38.380- 32:44.240* :  Dr. Emma Pomeroy. One of the greats of early rock and roll Dwayne Eddie has died at the age
*32:44.240- 32:50.420* :  of 86. He'd been diagnosed with cancer. A pioneer of the twangy guitar sound, Dwayne Eddie
*32:50.420- 32:56.340* :  enjoyed a series of instrumental hits in the late 1950s and early 60s and was inducted into the
*32:56.340- 33:02.040* :  rock and roll hall of fame in 1994. Our arts correspondent David Silito looks back at his life.
*33:04.660- 33:10.420* :  Dwayne Eddie, Peter Gunn, and the twang, his utterly distinctive guitar style.
*33:13.480- 33:18.040* :  The sound he said was an echo of where he grew up, desolate, arid, Arizona.
*33:18.380- 33:23.100* :  There's something about the guitar and the sound of it and everything, it just kind of smacks
*33:23.100- 33:29.520* :  of the southwest from a wide open spaces. He had a run of hits in the 50s and 60s,
*33:30.000- 33:34.700* :  in the 80s the art of noise took him back into the charts and his final album was recorded
*33:35.040- 33:39.600* :  in his 70s with Sheffield's Richard Hawley, a long time admirer who said,
*33:40.020- 33:45.760* :  one note from that Gretz guitar was all you needed to hear to know you are listening to Dwayne Eddie.
*33:49.980- 33:55.720* :  Well another admirer was guitarist and singer songwriter Martin Simpson who met him in 2011
*33:55.720- 34:02.260* :  when he came to the UK. Dwayne was such an extraordinarily nice human being as well as being
*34:02.260- 34:10.080* :  really one of the one of the complete progenitors of the electric guitar as a larger thing in
*34:10.080- 34:14.480* :  society I believe. Did he play a gig with you? When he came when you met him what was he doing?
*34:14.680- 34:20.860* :  Well he played big gigs, he played Glaston Bridge, but he also played my local pub which is
*34:20.860- 34:27.980* :  the Greystones here in Sheffield which stands 200 people and seats 110 sort of thing. So
*34:28.480- 34:34.420* :  to stand at the very front of the stage listening to that sound, what a sound, what a fabulous
*34:34.420- 34:37.980* :  note. I know the better the punters couldn't believe it. You talked about him as one of the progenitors,
*34:37.980- 34:43.240* :  the word I keep reading in these obitaries I'm seeing online is a pioneer. Just explain to us if
*34:43.240- 34:47.940* :  you would Martin why Dwayne Eddie was such a key figure in the development of rock and roll.
*34:48.860- 34:55.420* :  Well he was to start with I think the first guitar hero there weren't people like him I should say
*34:55.980- 35:01.120* :  at that point nobody had heard these big sounding instrumental records. It was really before
*35:01.120- 35:07.880* :  surf he had a massive influence on for instance Hank Marvin who became a massive influential
*35:07.880- 35:14.600* :  guitar player over here. But if you think about what Hank Marvin did in many ways Dwayne Eddie is the
*35:14.600- 35:20.620* :  obvious inspiration for that. So you know the electric guitarist is now the biggest instrument
*35:20.620- 35:26.600* :  in the world and one of the people that started that was Dwayne. Can you explain for the non-guitarists
*35:27.480- 35:34.760* :  among us? Can you explain that twang technically? What is the twang? How did he make it? What was
*35:34.760- 35:43.740* :  a skill required? Well I mean he was playing a really beautiful 1950s Gretchen's guitar which has
*35:44.040- 35:50.480* :  a really extraordinary sound on its own but then that sound was run into a very big amp with lots
*35:50.480- 35:58.000* :  of bass response and he played on the bass strings and his producer Lee Hazelwood he had an
*35:58.380- 36:04.780* :  enormous water tank which he used as an echo chamber. So part of the charm of that guitar sound
*36:04.780- 36:11.960* :  is the fact that it was recorded in a water tank. Martin Simpson talking to Amel Radgen about Dwayne
*36:11.960- 36:18.180* :  Eddie who's died at the age of 86. And that's it from us for now but there'll be a new edition of
