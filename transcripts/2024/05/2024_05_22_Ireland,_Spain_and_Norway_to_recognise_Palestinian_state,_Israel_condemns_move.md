*01:29.920- 01:36.200* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh and at 1400 GMT on Wednesday the 22nd of May, these are our main stories.
*01:37.220- 01:42.680* :  Norway, Ireland and Spain are to recognise Palestine as an independent state in a move condemned
*01:42.680- 01:47.980* :  by Israel as a reward for terrorism. Russia says it's captured another village during heavy
*01:47.980- 01:53.200* :  fighting in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, Kyiv says the situation there is very difficult.
*01:53.260- 01:57.920* :  A huge crowd has been following the funeral possession of the later Iranian president,
*01:57.920- 02:00.540* :  Ebrahim Raecee, through the streets of Tehran.
*02:04.080- 02:05.100* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:10.300- 02:14.160* :  I do not wish to fight against you because I think you've always my brothers.
*02:14.800- 02:19.920* :  In Myanmar, opposition fighters express confidence as they urge soldiers to surrender.
*02:24.960- 02:31.140* :  As the trauma in Gaza continues, a new stage in the international political backlash against Israel.
*02:44.660- 02:52.320* :  Today, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognise the stage of Palestine.
*02:53.180- 02:56.960* :  That was the Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris speaking in Dublin earlier today.
*02:57.100- 03:00.640* :  It followed similar announcements by his Norwegian counterpart,
*03:00.640- 03:05.300* :  Eunice Gastura, and by the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez.
*03:07.580- 03:13.840* :  We're going to recognise Palestine for many reasons and we can sum that up in three words.
*03:15.000- 03:17.620* :  Peace, justice and consistency.
*03:19.460- 03:25.080* :  Have to make sure that the two states' solution is respected
*03:27.880- 03:30.240* :  and there must be mutual guarantees of security.
*03:31.700- 03:34.240* :  This has been required by many other states as well as us.
*03:34.940- 03:40.000* :  Hamas hailed the move as a turning point, but these rallies are furious and have
*03:40.000- 03:42.140* :  recalled their envoys from all three countries.
*03:42.740- 03:44.700* :  So, lots of strands to pull together.
*03:45.240- 03:49.680* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale told me a bit more about what the trio of
*03:49.680- 03:50.720* :  announcements may mean.
*03:51.300- 03:53.120* :  This is something they've been talking about for some time.
*03:53.120- 03:56.740* :  They've been trying to coordinate so that it makes a political impact.
*03:56.740- 04:02.740* :  The last European country to recognise the state of Palestine was Sweden in 2014 and that's
*04:02.740- 04:05.600* :  slightly sort of disappeared. It didn't really have that much impact.
*04:05.600- 04:07.020* :  So, they wanted to act together.
*04:07.020- 04:10.760* :  It's possible other countries will join them in coming days.
*04:11.320- 04:15.200* :  And essentially their aim is to shift the diplomatic dial,
*04:15.200- 04:21.320* :  essentially to sort of get people talking once again about the idea of a two-state solution.
*04:21.440- 04:26.060* :  And clearly, by definition, a two-state solution requires a Palestinian state.
*04:26.820- 04:33.260* :  At the moment, most countries that oppose a Palestinian state or won't recognise one now say,
*04:33.260- 04:37.380* :  look, we do want one, but only in the long-term, as part of a long-term political settlement,
*04:37.380- 04:40.700* :  what these three countries are saying is, look, we're going to join the mainstream,
*04:40.700- 04:42.740* :  because most countries in the world do recognise Palestine.
*04:43.380- 04:47.500* :  And they're trying to say, look, if you're going to get any progress in the Middle East,
*04:47.860- 04:49.900* :  you've got to have some kind of political process.
*04:50.300- 04:51.080* :  Let's get back to that.
*04:52.080- 04:55.700* :  Well, how big a blow is this to Israel, especially given the announcement early this week
*04:55.700- 04:59.640* :  that the International Criminal Court was seeking a response against Mr Netanyahu
*04:59.840- 05:01.060* :  and his defence minister?
*05:01.780- 05:03.760* :  Look, in practical terms, there's not going to make any difference at all.
*05:03.900- 05:05.560* :  Palestine, in your state, is not going to come into existence,
*05:05.560- 05:08.860* :  just because three more countries say, we recognise it.
*05:08.860- 05:10.960* :  Nine countries in Europe do that already.
*05:11.580- 05:12.960* :  Most of them form a Soviet countries.
*05:13.600- 05:18.000* :  But what I think it does do is it adds political and diplomatic pressure on Israel,
*05:18.000- 05:22.040* :  as you say, coming in the wake of the ICC prosecutor's announcement.
*05:22.060- 05:27.060* :  But in practical terms, I don't think Israel will worry too much about this.
*05:27.060- 05:30.100* :  There's a lot of fury and rhetoric going on.
*05:30.100- 05:34.820* :  Israel's foreign minister has denounced this saying the move undermines Israel's security
*05:34.860- 05:41.480* :  and its sovereignty and he's recalled his country's three ambassadors from Norway, Spain and Ireland.
*05:41.520- 05:44.860* :  But I think that the Israelis will have long expected this.
*05:45.360- 05:49.980* :  As ever, the bottom line for them is what does the United States, their main ally think
*05:49.980- 05:51.740* :  and their main military supporter?
*05:52.220- 05:56.140* :  And at the moment, the United States clearly takes the view not to recognise
*05:56.140- 06:02.360* :  a Palestinian state until it is part of a final, long-term political settlement to the whole region.
*06:02.880- 06:06.660* :  James Landel, this was the scene in Tehran earlier today.
*06:13.100- 06:20.760* :  Perchast, Vafal, Chardast, Bautourou, Sep. 10s of thousands of Iranians, mostly men,
*06:21.140- 06:24.560* :  lined the streets of the Iranian capital for the main funeral ceremony
*06:24.560- 06:29.560* :  of late President Ibrahim Reisi. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Hamani,
*06:29.560- 06:33.260* :  led prayers for the president who was killed, along with the foreign minister,
*06:33.260- 06:39.180* :  in a helicopter crash on Sunday. From Tehran, Mr Reisi's body will be taken to Mashad,
*06:39.180- 06:42.600* :  his home city, in the northeast, to be buried on Thursday.
*06:43.420- 06:46.580* :  State media say high-ranking foreign dignitaries will attend.
*06:47.420- 06:49.620* :  What does all this mean for the future of Iran?
*06:49.620- 06:52.800* :  Here's our Chief International Correspondence, leaves to set.
*06:53.360- 06:58.760* :  These kind of scenes today, the throngs of people surging through the streets,
*06:59.660- 07:02.260* :  men in turbines, women in long black,
*07:03.140- 07:10.100* :  shaltting today again, death to America, death to Israel, has become the signature of the
*07:10.100- 07:12.980* :  Islamic Republic of Iran. People have come out in the streets like that.
*07:12.980- 07:18.660* :  Ever since Iran's revolutionary leader came in 1979 for the revolution.
*07:19.320- 07:22.800* :  But of course, decades on, it's a very different Iran, and there have been
*07:22.800- 07:27.840* :  not just these kinds of scenes of mourning, and some of the mourning is genuine.
*07:28.400- 07:30.240* :  Some of it is, people have been bust-in.
*07:30.280- 07:34.440* :  There have also been scenes of celebration when the news broke.
*07:35.220- 07:38.460* :  Early Monday morning that the President Ibrahim Reisi,
*07:38.460- 07:45.040* :  his foreign minister Abdulayyan, and six others had perished in an helicopter crash
*07:45.700- 07:51.300* :  in the northwest of Iran, which is why there have been warnings by the top prosecutor.
*07:51.300- 07:56.860* :  An action, police cases have already been filed against Iranian websites who have,
*07:56.860- 08:03.580* :  in their words, been publishing lies and insults, criticizing the deceased President.
*08:04.120- 08:06.120* :  Well, indeed, he was a very divisive figure.
*08:06.980- 08:11.640* :  He was a very divisive figure. He came of age during the revolution, who was a protégé
*08:11.700- 08:17.280* :  of the first revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, and then grew very close and was seen
*08:17.280- 08:23.060* :  to be absolutely loyal to the current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Hamanei, and he has been in
*08:23.060- 08:28.800* :  recent weeks. He's been cited as one of the leading contenders to take on the top job.
*08:29.460- 08:33.560* :  But for many Iranians, he is also associated with the darkest chapter, one of the darkest
*08:33.560- 08:39.140* :  chapters in this history. He was on what was called a death committee as a young prosecutor
*08:39.140- 08:44.960* :  when thousands of political prisoners were executed. He always said that he didn't sign the death
*08:44.960- 08:51.340* :  warrant, but he was certainly part of that process. And those who have celebrated his death have
*08:51.340- 08:57.360* :  said that what they really wanted was an investigation into what really happened. And of course,
*08:57.360- 09:04.560* :  in recent years, on his watch, Iran saw unprecedented protests against clerical rule, and in particular,
*09:04.560- 09:11.080* :  the restrictions imposed on a new generation. Most of all women, he, of course, would have been
*09:11.080- 09:17.320* :  part of that crackdown, which human rights group says killed at least 300 people and thousands
*09:17.320- 09:24.100* :  were detained. Least who said, the village of Khashivka in Ukraine is one of only a handful on
*09:24.100- 09:29.760* :  the eastern front that Kiev claimed back in its counteroffensive last year. But now Russia says
*09:29.760- 09:34.760* :  its forces have taken the village again. The Ukrainian army has come under intense pressure
*09:34.760- 09:40.260* :  in the past two weeks, fighting off a fresh Russian offensive in the northeastern Khakhiv region,
*09:40.700- 09:46.240* :  while also facing shortages of ammunition across the front lines. So has this village been
*09:46.240- 09:52.760* :  retaken by the Russians? Our correspondent, Kiev, is James Waterhouse. It's disputed by the
*09:52.760- 09:57.880* :  Ukrainian military for a start. I mean, we've got this one line statement from Russian forces
*09:58.880- 10:03.940* :  saying its units have liberated the village of Khashivka in the Dignetsk region. But the wording
*10:03.940- 10:10.800* :  they use is in the Dignets people's republic. That is a label for territory which Russia occupied
*10:10.800- 10:17.380* :  as far back as as 2014. So it's clear in the medium term that Russia was trying to
*10:17.980- 10:23.720* :  occupy the entire Dignetsk region, as well as the Lahansk region further north. I think that's
*10:23.720- 10:29.680* :  a definite more immediate goal. But in its dispute really, in its denial, that this has happened.
*10:30.440- 10:34.800* :  The Ukrainian army says it's repelled around six major attacks around this area
*10:35.540- 10:41.820* :  from the direction of Bakmut, which was captured early last year. The spokesman says three were
*10:42.420- 10:47.460* :  repelled. And we're talking about attacks where you see groups of armed vehicles and tanks
*10:47.460- 10:52.740* :  storming through and troops then disembark and try and capture Ukrainian positions. And at the
*10:52.740- 10:58.740* :  moment we're told that the situation is under control, but there is still heavy fighting. And the
*10:58.740- 11:05.580* :  adjective President Zelensky goes for is extremely difficult to characterize the whole east and
*11:05.580- 11:09.960* :  the north-eastern front. The reason things are so difficult notably in the Dignetsk region is
*11:09.960- 11:15.400* :  because Ukrainian forces have had to redeploy further north because of this new Russian
*11:15.400- 11:21.020* :  incursion across the border into the Havkiv region. Yes, so despite the word from Ukraine,
*11:21.020- 11:26.820* :  how significant is this Russian encroachment? Well, in the village of Tishivka, I think we're
*11:26.820- 11:33.280* :  still talking about, you know, it's not significant on its own. I think if you're talking about
*11:33.280- 11:38.340* :  the direction of the Russian forces trying to take a tank called Chazavjar, which is on a kill,
*11:38.340- 11:43.660* :  which is well connected, that would put Ukraine in a very difficult position because it is
*11:43.660- 11:48.800* :  that of then in the line of sight from invading forces like Constantinivka, like Kramators,
*11:48.800- 11:55.060* :  like Kupiansk further north where invading forces are getting closer. And so a very deliberate
*11:55.060- 12:01.260* :  way, I think, is Russia trying to draw Ukrainian forces further north. James Waterhouse.
*12:01.920- 12:06.320* :  It's an odd look when a political party bars its lead candidate from appearing at election
*12:06.320- 12:12.180* :  events, but that's just what the far right alternative for Germany has done with its lead candidate
*12:12.180- 12:17.980* :  for the forthcoming European elections, Maximilian Krah. It follows a series of statements,
*12:18.000- 12:23.540* :  including the latest in which he said Nazi SS officers weren't necessarily criminals.
*12:24.460- 12:30.100* :  Damien McGinnis reports from Berlin. Maximilian Krah was supposed to lead Germany's far
*12:30.100- 12:35.560* :  right AFD in the European Parliament elections. Instead, he is now stepping down from the party's
*12:35.560- 12:42.020* :  leadership and will not appear at any campaign events. Mr Krah was already accused of links to China
*12:42.020- 12:47.440* :  and alleged payments from Russia, but the final straw came when he told an Italian newspaper
*12:47.500- 12:54.120* :  that Nazi soldiers and Hitler's SS weren't necessarily criminals. This sparked outrage
*12:54.120- 12:59.780* :  among far right allies in France and Italy, where the SS committed atrocities in the war.
*13:00.540- 13:07.360* :  Damien McGinnis. For the first time, breakdancing, officially known as breaking, will be part of the
*13:07.360- 13:14.660* :  Olympic Games. Manizia Talash is the only female breaker representing Afghanistan. She fled when
*13:14.660- 13:20.520* :  the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, and has since been selected by the Olympic Committee
*13:20.520- 13:27.480* :  as part of the refugee team. Karwun Kamush has been to Spain, where Manizia has been training for
*13:27.480- 13:35.880* :  the Paris Olympics in July. By going to the Olympics, I want to show that Afghan girls will
*13:35.900- 13:50.200* :  surrender. They will win despite any challenge or obstacle. Manizia Talash started breakdancing
*13:50.200- 13:55.800* :  at a hip-hop club in Kabul four years ago. She was the only girl in her class.
*13:56.720- 14:01.520* :  She knew she would need to be confident to make steps towards her Olympic dream.
*14:01.520- 14:10.220* :  Today we have a core explosion near to our club. But things haven't been easy. In a conservative
*14:10.900- 14:18.020* :  society, hip-hop fans have many enemies, many faced attacks. Manizia continued despite the
*14:18.020- 14:23.620* :  threats and the bombing attempt on her club. They had to close their venue and she continued
*14:23.620- 14:29.840* :  her training at home. But when the Taliban returned to power, they banned women's sport.
*14:30.520- 14:38.520* :  Manizia and her friends were forced to leave the country. This is my bedroom. I moved here
*14:38.520- 14:44.820* :  a month ago, but I would like to be surrounded by the things I like. I am meeting her and her small
*14:44.820- 14:53.480* :  flat in Madrid. Her bedroom is full of posters of artists like Topak, Biggie, Viana and Nicki Minaj.
*14:54.080- 14:58.420* :  But above a picture of phrasing cards, I see poster of a bomb blast.
*14:59.260- 15:06.520* :  Some posters that remind me of Afghanistan, like bombs and the Afghan dancing girl. I'd like to
*15:06.520- 15:12.720* :  remember what I have been through. After she became a refugee, Manizia thought she would never
*15:12.720- 15:18.700* :  get into the Olympics. But earlier this meant the Olympic Committee announced that there would be
*15:19.000- 15:24.780* :  a refugee team. She watched the announcement from her sofa, Thomas Bach, present of the Olympic
*15:24.780- 15:32.900* :  Committee. Here are the athletes of the IOC refugee Olympic team Paris 2024. Manizia,
*15:32.900- 15:39.520* :  Talash, breaking. Manizia will be part of the Olympic refugee team and will represent all those
*15:39.520- 15:42.540* :  who have been forced to flee their home country globally.
*15:46.520- 15:52.200* :  The announcement is a source of immense pride for her coach. Javotsavri, a member of the
*15:52.200- 15:57.980* :  Superior School and AK-13 band, was her first coach who came to Madrid with her.
*16:05.020- 16:10.860* :  Breaking was categorized as an Olympic sport in recent years and added to the Paris 2024 Olympic
*16:10.900- 16:17.640* :  Games. It will be a tough competition, but Manizia's selection is a proud moment for the hip-hop
*16:17.700- 16:24.400* :  community of Afghanistan. For them and for many women in the country, it is already a big win.
*16:30.980- 16:32.020* :  Kaewoon Kamush.
*16:36.060- 16:39.280* :  Why mango picking season in Uganda has become a hazard?
*16:39.880- 16:44.900* :  Sometimes defines you in a garden. You'll get attacked by the elephants, but the government
*16:44.900- 16:47.980* :  is not paying attention to our cry for help.
*16:55.680- 16:59.680* :  Three years after the civilian government of Anshansuchi was overthrown,
*16:59.680- 17:05.460* :  the Ku leaders in Myanmar have lost control of more than half the country. After peaceful
*17:05.460- 17:11.660* :  opposition was put down in 2021, the opposition began an armed resistance, while ethnic rebels
*17:11.660- 17:17.760* :  stepped up their long-running insurgencies. Last October, some of those groups joined forces and
*17:17.760- 17:23.140* :  began making huge territorial gains, posing the biggest challenge to the military government in
*17:23.140- 17:26.160* :  years. Our correspondent, Quentin Somerville,
*17:26.400- 17:31.280* :  travelled with rebel forces to their jungle bases and on frontlines where the insurgents are
*17:31.280- 17:34.140* :  challenging Myanmar's generals like never before.
*17:37.800- 17:41.640* :  Unless you can hear, while cicadas and the trees are walking through a park in Loica,
*17:41.640- 17:47.460* :  the state capital, and heading towards the front line with some fighters from the K&DF,
*17:48.180- 17:55.340* :  one of the Karani rebel groups. In November, they launched a surprise attack on the city pushing
*17:56.160- 18:05.400* :  the military back. They control about half the city, but overall in Karani state, they say they've
*18:05.400- 18:14.640* :  taken 90% of the state. Motor craters, air strikes, stretching all around here. This was the
*18:14.640- 18:20.680* :  government area hit by mortals, etc. Something really significant has been achieved because they were
*18:20.720- 18:26.100* :  in the jungle. That's where their resistance was, but now they're here in the city right in the
*18:26.100- 18:35.440* :  heart of state power and the people who were oppressing them, occurring now in buildings and
*18:35.440- 18:44.140* :  basements, while these rebel forces have them at least on the ground surrounded.
*18:45.440- 18:48.720* :  The military have held power here for more than half a century.
*18:48.720- 18:53.980* :  They have warplanes, tanks, and artillery. The opposition forces barely have body armor
*18:53.980- 18:59.220* :  and are running short of ammunition. It's difficult terrain. The main roads are still within
*18:59.220- 19:04.960* :  range of army guns. In my month with the insurgents, we barely ever took main roads to steep jungle
*19:04.960- 19:12.120* :  tracks and dirt trails. They took us near the town of Seesang in Chan State. Philip from the K&DF
*19:12.320- 19:17.600* :  was a guide. You can see the far way of the village. They're really pleased that they're
*19:17.600- 19:23.080* :  arriving dead because our people are in the main front. That artillery shell landed out
*19:23.080- 19:28.440* :  200 meters from where we are. It's all open farmland here, but the military forces have actually
*19:28.440- 19:35.420* :  infiltrated around this area through the villages. So it seems like the front lines are a bit more fluid.
*19:47.720- 19:53.000* :  So that's I think three shells have come in in the last five minutes and you really get the
*19:53.000- 19:57.600* :  sense of what this conflict is about because that is a professional military over there firing
*19:57.600- 20:02.920* :  artillery, firing mortars. These men are irregular. There are strong alliance and they've had a lot
*20:02.920- 20:10.120* :  of success, but they're taking on a professional army. It's a very close man. It's not safe.
*20:10.140- 20:20.020* :  Let's go get fast. Let's get out of range. Ready, go down here, go get out.
*20:21.260- 20:26.820* :  Under the shade of some mango trees, one of his hidden encampments, Amit Maui Po Taiki,
*20:26.820- 20:32.720* :  the powerfully built tattooed commander of the K&DF, the Karene Nationalities Defence Force.
*20:33.540- 20:38.620* :  An environmentalist who studied in the United States, he first picked up a gun three years ago
*20:38.620- 20:44.540* :  and hates military titles. Please don't call me general, he says. More than 350
*20:44.780- 20:52.080* :  our brother and sister already sacrificed their life. More than 200 sacrificed for their body parts.
*20:52.700- 20:59.820* :  At the same time, hundreds of people are willing to join with us and willing to fight against
*20:59.820- 21:06.560* :  the Burma Army. So those are our friends. We do have enough heart. We do have enough
*21:06.560- 21:13.300* :  moral. We do have enough humanity. That's the way how we're going to defeat them.
*21:17.320- 21:22.980* :  Hundreds of the fresh recruits graduate today are marching, then the rubber sole canvas shoes
*21:22.980- 21:30.600* :  and the full uniforms. This rebel group has seen its ranks swollen by the fact that the military
*21:30.600- 21:36.220* :  hunter that runs this country have enforced conscription and that's forced a lot of young men and
*21:36.220- 21:41.480* :  women into rebel areas. This is the biggest graduation they've ever seen here.
*21:47.060- 21:54.380* :  As the ceremony ends, the mood is wild. The young rapper MCK R.A., who also graduated that day,
*21:54.920- 21:58.640* :  sent the fresh recruits into a frenzy of dancing and celebration.
*22:00.620- 22:05.300* :  The ranks have never been stronger. Their battlefield victories never greater,
*22:06.080- 22:11.580* :  but their enemy has more firepower and more manpower. These men and women graduating today
*22:11.580- 22:17.480* :  say that won't stop them. Their victory may not come tomorrow or even soon, but the momentum
*22:17.480- 22:21.020* :  in this war to free Myanmar is on their side.
*22:25.020- 22:31.340* :  Quentin Somerville. Min Zauu is the executive director of Myanmar's Institute for Peace and
*22:31.340- 22:36.900* :  Security and was a rebel guerrilla himself many years ago before becoming a peace negotiator.
*22:37.700- 22:42.320* :  Is it surprising that so many civilians were now taking up arms in the fight against the
*22:42.320- 22:50.900* :  military government? After the military coup, we recorded over 400 newly formed armed groups
*22:50.900- 22:59.100* :  popped out. That was a quite significant phenomenon. That was unprecedented in Myanmar history.
*22:59.740- 23:06.940* :  Generally what we could say is that ethnicity-driven armed groups fight better than
*23:07.700- 23:12.060* :  ideologically-driven armed groups in Myanmar. So this is a pattern.
*23:13.120- 23:18.040* :  The presence of so many different armed groups, and perhaps the
*23:19.160- 23:22.980* :  superiority in fighting that you described there, the ethnic armed groups,
*23:24.220- 23:31.240* :  it's perhaps not very promising for the country's future as a stable country that exists
*23:32.060- 23:38.780* :  where all the ethnic groups can coexist. The future is bleak for only different reason.
*23:38.780- 23:45.660* :  Even if the military is defeated, a lot of these armed groups and the different commands,
*23:46.840- 23:54.040* :  we don't know how they're going to proceed without having any concrete solution.
*23:54.480- 24:01.420* :  And now we have already observed intergroup fighting in different parts of the country
*24:02.200- 24:07.980* :  where the military were pushed out. So that means that one of the military was a very significant
*24:07.980- 24:13.380* :  common enemy to all these groups of fighting against the military. But when the military was pushed
*24:14.420- 24:20.680* :  then these groups, they competing for like a territory control and also economic resources.
*24:21.680- 24:30.120* :  A lot of armed groups operate in many different areas, texting on businesses, logging,
*24:30.380- 24:38.740* :  natural resources, mining, dry economy itself is like about 70 to 80 billions a year.
*24:39.380- 24:46.840* :  So all these combine, even if the tone is gone, that kind of war economy persists.
*24:48.300- 24:55.500* :  And a lot of civilians are now moving away from those conflict-effective areas, not only because
*24:55.500- 25:03.900* :  of the fighting, but also because of those war economy and those taxation. So that became a very
*25:03.900- 25:11.780* :  and trench problem in Myanmar. Min Zauu was speaking to my colleague, James Coppano.
*25:13.000- 25:17.980* :  It's been described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in the UK, and there were emotional
*25:17.980- 25:23.640* :  scenes as the inquiry into the post office scandal resumed in London today. With for the first time,
*25:23.640- 25:29.380* :  the former post office boss, Paula Venel's giving evidence. She began by issuing an apology
*25:30.000- 25:34.520* :  and then was asked about the aftermath of one of the sub-postmasters who'd taken their life
*25:34.960- 25:43.180* :  after being wrongfully prosecuted on her watch. I phoned the family and I spoke to the father
*25:43.520- 25:51.920* :  who explained to me that there were other issues involved. And I imagined that I'm sorry,
*25:52.940- 25:57.280* :  I imagined that I was probably- Miss Venel was just rather than trying to talk through your-
*25:57.280- 26:03.980* :  I beg your pardon. Just pause. Yes, okay. Try and compose yourself if you can, and then continue
*26:03.980- 26:11.780* :  your evidence please. Thank you. Hundreds of sub-postmasters, the people that run small post offices,
*26:12.260- 26:17.380* :  were prosecuted for stealing. After faulty software, wrongly said money was missing from branch
*26:17.380- 26:23.100* :  accounts. Money went to prison for false accounting and theft. Others were financially ruined.
*26:23.260- 26:29.840* :  Some as we've heard, took their own lives. Our UK correspondent Rob Watson has been following
*26:29.840- 26:35.600* :  events at the inquiry until be more about its significance. It looks like being the biggest
*26:35.600- 26:42.660* :  miscarriage of British justice in living memory, maybe beyond that, nearly a thousand postmasters
*26:42.660- 26:49.060* :  were affected. And the reason why I think it hits home so much in the UK is because the post offices
*26:49.060- 26:54.460* :  are at the heart of many communities, so people go in there to collect their pensions, people go
*26:54.460- 26:59.040* :  in there to do all sorts of business. So these people were known in the community. And then a TV
*26:59.040- 27:04.720* :  drama really brought this home, this idea of ordinary people having been persecuted gone to prison.
*27:04.720- 27:10.760* :  As you said, some ended up committing suicide. Now, Paula Venel, she was the head of the whole thing,
*27:10.760- 27:15.960* :  and up until very, very recently, she had insisted the post office had done nothing wrong.
*27:15.960- 27:21.360* :  There had been no miscarriages of justices and the prosecutions continued. And so far,
*27:21.360- 27:27.080* :  her answer has been, look, I was just too trusting. I believe too many reassurances that the software
*27:27.080- 27:32.380* :  was okay. I just didn't see what was happening. It wasn't reported back up to me. Now,
*27:32.380- 27:37.320* :  whether that is seen as credible and really interestingly, there was a dramatic moment in the inquiry.
*27:37.320- 27:41.600* :  When she was confronted with a WhatsApp message from one of her own friends, a senior
*27:41.600- 27:45.700* :  management, a colleague who said, how could you not have known? I mean, all these years,
*27:45.700- 27:50.840* :  how could you not have known? Now, some of the victims of the scandal actually turned up outside
*27:50.840- 27:55.240* :  the hearing today. What do you think they'll have been making of what they've heard so far?
*27:55.600- 28:00.380* :  I suspect that they will think it's just incredible that someone could have been running the post office
*28:00.380- 28:04.320* :  could have been in such a senior position and could have carried on telling the world that there
*28:04.320- 28:09.680* :  was nothing wrong with the software and that there had been no miscarriages of justice. I mean,
*28:09.680- 28:14.500* :  I suppose they will be struck by the way in which she at one point was in tears and as
*28:14.500- 28:20.880* :  repeatedly said that she apologises that she's very sorry for what happened, but again, I suspect
*28:20.880- 28:25.700* :  based on what they will have heard so far, they will be asking the same question that that senior
*28:26.400- 28:30.660* :  executive posed to her and a WhatsApp message, which is, how could you not have known that things
*28:30.660- 28:36.260* :  were going wrong? And just briefly, put this into a context for a global audience, Rob, how
*28:36.260- 28:41.160* :  big a scandal is this for the UK? It's a huge scandal for the reason I said that these post offices
*28:41.160- 28:46.060* :  are at the heart of community life, but I think because it feeds into that sort of wider sense of
*28:46.060- 28:51.420* :  malaise in Britain that the system doesn't seem to be working, nothing seems to be working properly.
*28:52.260- 28:58.700* :  Rob Watson. It's mango season in Uganda and with it comes a chance to enjoy the delicious
*28:58.700- 29:04.520* :  fruit and make money from the harvest, but is also a time of extreme danger. That's because
*29:04.520- 29:10.200* :  hundreds of elephants from South Sudan cross the border and invade farmers gardens to feast on
*29:10.200- 29:15.700* :  the fruit. It's been happening for more than a decade and many farmers now say they live in fear
*29:15.700- 29:21.040* :  of the elephants, which encroach on their land while they're harvesting. One of those farmers
*29:21.040- 29:27.400* :  is Scove in Iseta from Moyo district, one of the worst hit areas. They come and destroy the
*29:27.400- 29:33.480* :  properties like the food crops, sometimes defines you in a garden, you'll get attacked by the
*29:33.480- 29:39.180* :  elephants, but the government is not paying attention to our cry for help. There is no action
*29:39.180- 29:44.940* :  taken by the government and the question is how long the farmers like us suffer? The government
*29:44.940- 29:50.100* :  has the mandate to see the citizens are protected in the hands of the elephant,
*29:50.100- 29:56.080* :  equal the elephants are intelligent animals that need to be protected. Much as we are aware that
*29:56.080- 30:01.020* :  the elephant brings income to the government, it's the responsibility of the government to initiate
*30:01.020- 30:06.340* :  our projects that can prevent this elephant from coming to invade the farms of the people.
*30:06.720- 30:11.720* :  Mays, plantations, cassava plantations, even onion plantations, and when the elephant
*30:11.720- 30:17.040* :  enters, they want to take the mangoes, but in the process of their movement, they will destroy all
*30:17.040- 30:23.180* :  the crops. Whenever the season of mangoes comes around, definitely you'll find that at night hours,
*30:23.180- 30:29.080* :  even daytime, the elephant enters in the garden and destroy crops. So this costs a lot of
*30:29.080- 30:35.420* :  fear in the minds of the people. The family is suffered greatly in terms of hunger and the government
*30:35.420- 30:41.760* :  is not paying attention to us. For more than 15 years, the people of Duffele have been suffering
*30:41.760- 30:49.120* :  in the hands of these elephants. Farmer Scovin Issetter. In 1968, Louis Armstrong
*30:49.120- 30:53.900* :  recorded what critics consider his last great musical performance at the BBC.
*30:54.760- 30:59.900* :  Later this year, it will be released as an album with extra material along with the footage.
*31:00.460- 31:05.740* :  The legendary trumpeter, then age 67, was in London to promote what a wonderful world,
*31:05.740- 31:11.260* :  which had just topped the charts. Nicholas Dambridge has been listening to Louis in London
*31:11.600- 31:13.420* :  and delving into the BBC archives.
*31:18.100- 31:22.580* :  A return to glory for one of the greatest jazz musicians, previously unreleased
*31:22.580- 31:29.000* :  longer versions and film footage of Louis Armstrong at the BBC July 2, 1968.
*31:35.700- 31:39.860* :  Ricky Ricardi is head of the archive at the Louis Armstrong Museum in New York.
*31:40.700- 31:46.200* :  Well, to me, it really is Louis Armstrong's last hurrah. Two months later, he was in intensive care
*31:46.200- 31:50.640* :  and then he was in and out of hospitals, trying so hard to get back on stage.
*31:50.640- 31:54.300* :  Spear it was willing, but his body can no longer handle the toll.
*31:58.920- 32:04.080* :  But that night, his chops, as he called them, were in top shape and his tone,
*32:04.080- 32:08.740* :  that swing feel that he just kind of put on the map. It's all there and he just sounds
*32:08.740- 32:14.100* :  really, really, really strong. His health did suffer, didn't it, for his music and his playing
*32:14.100- 32:20.280* :  style? He normally was performing about 300 days a year. And so that first caught up with him in
*32:20.280- 32:25.180* :  1959. He had a heart attack, but it was a ruling life. His vocalist, Velma Middleton,
*32:25.960- 32:30.420* :  died on the road in Africa and his clarinetist, Buster Bailey, died on the road in 1967.
*32:30.420- 32:36.580* :  His pianist, Billy Kyle, died on the road. By September 1968, he was having heart troubles, kidney
*32:36.580- 32:43.660* :  troubles, which is why the 1968 BBC recording is so important. I see dreams of bringing
*32:43.700- 32:43.880* :  to you.
*32:45.660- 32:57.040* :  Red blood, blue tears. I see them blue for me and you. And I think to myself,
*33:00.800- 33:02.940* :  what a wonderful way.
*33:05.960- 33:10.280* :  Here comes 67-year-old Louis Armstrong now with the number one hit in London with
*33:10.280- 33:15.740* :  what a wonderful world. And that's actually what spurred on this 1968 tour of Great Britain.
*33:16.100- 33:20.520* :  Could you imagine that life growing up in the battlefield in New Orleans, not knowing where his
*33:20.520- 33:25.560* :  next meal comes from, sent to the colored Wafesome, which was basically a juvenile detention center
*33:25.980- 33:29.880* :  where he received formal lessons and learned how to play the cornette. And now he's almost
*33:29.880- 33:34.180* :  seven years old with another number one hit going around the world. It's just the ultimate
*33:34.180- 33:39.720* :  rags to riches story you can ever dream of. From the BBC archives and interview with Louis Armstrong,
*33:39.740- 33:48.600* :  given during the 1968 UK tour. It's so much in one of the world that brings me back to my
*33:48.600- 33:56.300* :  neighborhood where I live in Corona, New York, and Lucille and I ever since remarried. We've been
*33:56.300- 34:03.500* :  right there in that block and everybody keeps their little homes up like we do. And it's just
*34:03.500- 34:10.540* :  like one big family. I saw three generations come up in that block. And they're all with their
*34:10.540- 34:16.940* :  children, grandchildren. They come back to see Uncle Satchmo and I'm Lucille. That's why I can say,
*34:33.340- 34:41.780* :  That home is your museum, isn't it? It is. The world's largest archives for any single jazz musician,
*34:41.840- 34:46.680* :  performed spaces where given trumpet lessons, Louis would have been very proud knowing that,
*34:46.680- 34:51.260* :  you know, one day on this little block in Corona, what she thought about every time he's saying
*34:51.260- 34:56.360* :  what a wonderful world that there would be people coming from around that wonderful world to see
*34:56.360- 34:57.840* :  his home and to see his museum.
