*01:33.720- 01:38.700* :  Hello I'm Oliver Conway we're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 13th of May.
*01:38.700- 01:43.680* :  The European Commission condemns a police crackdown on protesters outside parliament in Georgia.
*01:44.380- 01:49.040* :  Russian troops are intensifying attacks in northeastern Ukraine with battles reported in the
*01:49.040- 01:54.460* :  border town of Vofchansk. And a journalist in China who reported on the COVID outbreak in Wuhan
*01:54.460- 02:03.220* :  is set to be released from prison. Also in the podcast as Israel steps up its operations in Gaza
*02:03.220- 02:10.920* :  a warning that Hamas is far from being eliminated. Even though Hamas has suffered major losses in terms
*02:10.960- 02:18.020* :  of man and material. Hamas is still functioning it's alive it's kicking and it's really pushing back.
*02:18.800- 02:22.980* :  And this isn't to say that spending too much time on your phone doesn't make you miserable.
*02:23.200- 02:27.780* :  It's more to say that when you zoom out and you look at the spread of the internet on balance
*02:27.780- 02:32.840* :  it might be a positive. New research showing the internet can be good for you.
*02:38.820- 02:45.000* :  Several years before it first invaded Ukraine, Russia sent troops into Georgia to try to reassert
*02:45.000- 02:50.180* :  its influence over the former Soviet Republic. But many particularly young people there want to
*02:50.180- 02:55.360* :  escape from Moscow's orbit. And overnight thousands of Georgians gathered outside parliament in
*02:55.360- 03:00.940* :  the capital to Bliesey to protest against a new Russia-style foreign agents bill they fear will
*03:00.940- 03:05.400* :  block their hopes of joining the EU. The government says the law will increase transparency
*03:05.400- 03:08.080* :  and sent in riot police to disperse the protesters.
*03:13.400- 03:18.620* :  Around 20 people are reported to have been detained. Parliament is set to vote on the bill on
*03:18.620- 03:23.880* :  Tuesday. If it's passed it would label organisations that get more than 20% of their funding from
*03:23.880- 03:29.640* :  abroad as foreign agents. Critics say it is similar to legislation used by the Kremlin to
*03:29.640- 03:35.260* :  silence opposition voices. I am pretty sure that they will take this law, they will make what they
*03:35.260- 03:40.700* :  want and we're going to continue our protest as long as we will be able to, we will continue our
*03:40.700- 03:46.360* :  protest till the elections. I want Georgia to live in Europe. I do not want to wake up in Russia
*03:46.380- 03:55.820* :  and I have this sincere fear and I want to ask this government what does it really gave you that
*03:55.820- 04:02.120* :  it costs you our fear? Well, our caucus's correspondent Ray Handometri is in to Bliesey.
*04:02.120- 04:07.980* :  She spoke to Rob Young at the height of the protests. I'm standing outside parliament and there
*04:07.980- 04:15.040* :  are hundreds of policemen in the black uniforms and they are facing off against the protesters
*04:15.680- 04:23.920* :  in their colorful raincoats. So now protesters are chanting Sakhar Tvello. This is the name of their
*04:23.920- 04:30.940* :  country, Georgia, in Georgian and earlier we've heard the chance of slaves and no to the Russian
*04:30.940- 04:38.700* :  law. So the idea is these protesters, they spent the whole night outside parliament. They've been
*04:38.700- 04:44.660* :  dancing, they've been keeping themselves entertained and they were hoping to prevent the MPs from
*04:44.660- 04:51.460* :  the governing Georgian dream party from entering the building. But the MPs got insight and in fact
*04:51.460- 04:57.600* :  the legal affairs committee had already heard the third and final reading of the law. It was very
*04:57.600- 05:03.900* :  swift. We saw some live pictures from inside parliament half empty hallway. Opposition MPs were
*05:03.900- 05:10.820* :  absent from this third and final reading and where it's all heading now is the final vote that is
*05:10.820- 05:16.080* :  expected on Tuesday. Right, this is the controversial bill that is at the heart of this to speak.
*05:16.080- 05:21.860* :  It requires organisations that get more than a fifth of their funding from abroad to register as
*05:21.860- 05:26.860* :  agents under foreign influence and the protesters say this would be repressive legislation. They're
*05:26.860- 05:31.800* :  calling it the Russian law. Is there any prospect at all then that this won't become law?
*05:33.080- 05:40.460* :  It looks very unlikely that the government will change its mind to judging by all the statements
*05:40.460- 05:46.540* :  that we've been hearing in the past few days. But also I want to remind the listeners that there
*05:46.540- 05:53.180* :  has been a major intimidation campaign unleashed against the opponents of this bill, against
*05:53.180- 05:59.040* :  opposition politicians and activists. In the last few days a lot of people were beaten up,
*05:59.040- 06:06.040* :  they were getting threatening calls, swarnat and been told not to attend these rallies. Yesterday
*06:06.040- 06:11.800* :  the interior minister came out and reminded the protesters that they might be jailed for up to
*06:11.800- 06:17.000* :  four years if they damage any of the strategic buildings. So there's quite a lot of threat that
*06:17.000- 06:23.140* :  is coming from the authorities. But despite all of these people are here and they're protesting
*06:23.140- 06:28.700* :  because they believe that this is a turning point for their country. They believe that if this
*06:28.700- 06:35.640* :  law gets adopted it's going to indicate a major foreign policy change for Georgia even though the
*06:35.640- 06:40.640* :  government denies it. The government says it's not a pro-Russian law. We're still going to join
*06:40.640- 06:46.720* :  the EU, but that's not what the protesters believe in. Rehandometri and the Georgian capital to
*06:46.720- 06:52.340* :  Bliese. In our previous podcast our defence correspondent reported from inside the border town of
*06:52.340- 06:58.300* :  Vovchansk in northeastern Ukraine as Russian troops advanced. Now Moscow says its forces have
*06:58.300- 07:04.260* :  entered the town, some 45 kilometers from Ukraine's second city Harkiv. Vovchansk has been heavily
*07:04.260- 07:10.560* :  bombarded with Russia reported to be using glide bombs. Ukrainian government advisor Yuri Saks had
*07:10.560- 07:15.860* :  that despite the loss of several villages in the region Ukraine remains confident. It is very
*07:15.860- 07:19.920* :  serious. We are realistic about the assessment of the situation, but at the same time there is no
*07:19.920- 07:24.580* :  need for panic. We are sending reinforcements. More reserves are coming. We are expecting more
*07:24.580- 07:30.300* :  military support from our allies to arrive. So the situation is under control. We got an update on
*07:30.300- 07:34.200* :  what was happening in Vovchansk from our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse.
*07:34.660- 07:40.860* :  It seems that the fighting is only intensifying. This is a town that has come under what's been
*07:40.860- 07:45.780* :  described as unprecedented bombing. You have this claim that Russian forces are now in the city.
*07:45.780- 07:51.940* :  You have that disputed by Ukrainian forces. It's a familiar kind of pattern of claim and counterclaim
*07:52.160- 07:57.400* :  and there is an uncomfortable direction of travel along these two incursions that Russia has
*07:57.400- 08:02.900* :  made into the northeastern Harkiv region. Now they may well have taken nine villages and
*08:02.900- 08:08.960* :  counting and Ukraine may well say that it is containing them, but there are real fears that if
*08:08.960- 08:14.920* :  these forces were able to keep going and get within say 30 kilometers of the city of Harkiv,
*08:14.940- 08:19.760* :  then that would be within artillery range. And then air defenses can do nothing about that.
*08:19.760- 08:24.220* :  And I think people in Harkiv and other settlements know all too well what happens next.
*08:24.240- 08:28.440* :  You see it in the eastern Danetsk region where if Russian forces get close enough,
*08:28.440- 08:34.040* :  they then lay the cities to siege. They cause immeasurable damage. They make it even more
*08:34.040- 08:38.280* :  impossible for people to leave there, forcing them from their homes. And in the worst case scenario
*08:38.280- 08:43.860* :  for Ukraine, you have that optic of Russian troops pinning a Russian flag down amidst a pile of
*08:43.860- 08:48.740* :  rubble in something they call liberation. So it's not thought this current incursion is capable
*08:48.740- 08:52.540* :  of taking Harkiv, but they can certainly cause Ukraine a lot of problem.
*08:52.800- 08:58.620* :  Yeah, and how difficult would it be for the Russians to get within artillery range of Ukraine's
*08:58.620- 09:04.340* :  second city? That's what is not clear. We've had exhausted frustrated troops tell the BBC that
*09:04.600- 09:09.900* :  that these Russian troops walked in almost unchallenged with their being so few defenses there.
*09:09.900- 09:15.420* :  If we look at the rate of which Russia is taking territory, who knows, you know, that if they're
*09:15.420- 09:19.640* :  within 40 to 50 kilometers now, we're not talking about much territory. And it is forcing
*09:19.640- 09:26.520* :  Ukraine to deploy reserve troops there. So two things are clear. Russia is trying to capitalise on
*09:26.520- 09:32.380* :  that delayed American ammunition and weaponry for Ukrainian troops. And also Ukraine is desperately
*09:32.380- 09:36.720* :  trying to seek its only goal really for this year, which is to try and shore up the line in some
*09:36.760- 09:41.860* :  way. What is less certain is whether they are able to do that on what is a very unwelcome new
*09:41.860- 09:48.380* :  access on the frontline. James Woodhouse in Kiev. An investigation by Australia's public broadcaster
*09:48.380- 09:53.800* :  has revealed details of how China's secret police goes after dissidents living overseas.
*09:54.760- 10:00.700* :  A former Chinese spy now in Australia told ABC News that a unit of the Chinese secret service
*10:00.700- 10:06.140* :  had been in operation in Sydney as recently as last year. From there, Phil Mercer sent this report.
*10:06.140- 10:11.780* :  The spy named only as Eric describes a shadowy world of deception and abduction.
*10:11.820- 10:17.900* :  The former Chinese agent has told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation how he'd been ordered
*10:17.900- 10:24.940* :  by the secret police in Beijing to target dissidents overseas, including in India, Thailand, Canada,
*10:24.940- 10:30.420* :  and Australia. Eric said he would gain their confidence and lure them to countries from where
*10:30.420- 10:36.940* :  they could be kidnapped and sent back to China. He told journalists that he fled last year to Australia.
*10:37.760- 10:43.000* :  Meanwhile, an independent journalist jailed in China after reporting on the first COVID outbreak in
*10:43.000- 10:48.780* :  Wuhan is set to be released. Zhang Zhang served a four-year sentence after being found guilty of
*10:48.780- 10:53.760* :  quote, picking quarrels and provoking trouble. She said she was trying to tell the world the truth.
*10:56.220- 11:01.320* :  Maybe I have a rebellious soul. Why can't I film that? I'm just documenting the truth.
*11:01.480- 11:06.400* :  Why can't I show the truth? Zhang Zhang, in what is thought to be her last interview before,
*11:06.400- 11:11.260* :  she was detained. I heard more about her and her reporting from our Asia Pacific Regional
*11:11.260- 11:17.080* :  Editor, Celia Hatton. Zhang Zhang was originally trained as a lawyer, but right at the start of the
*11:17.080- 11:22.680* :  COVID outbreak, and those really early days, when very little was known, when the city of Wuhan,
*11:22.680- 11:27.580* :  where COVID is believed to have first emerged, was just in the process of being locked down.
*11:27.580- 11:34.600* :  She traveled there and started working as a self-starter journalist, and she started filing
*11:34.600- 11:39.180* :  videos that were shared all over the world on different social media platforms,
*11:40.320- 11:43.840* :  describing what she was seeing, describing what the people of Wuhan were experiencing,
*11:43.840- 11:50.040* :  and basically giving a really gutsy counter-narrative to what the Chinese state media was reporting,
*11:50.040- 11:54.160* :  which was the message from the official Chinese government was, okay, nothing to see here,
*11:54.160- 11:58.120* :  everything's under control. It's just a little minor sickness. Don't worry about this.
*11:58.120- 12:04.280* :  And Zhang Zhang and a few others were giving quite a different story. She filed over a hundred
*12:04.280- 12:09.420* :  videos over the course of a few months, and then she was arrested. And we didn't hear anything
*12:09.420- 12:15.480* :  else from her again, but really the key is that she reflected the fear and the unknown,
*12:15.480- 12:20.420* :  all those details that we didn't know about in the early days of the pandemic. She's one of the
*12:20.420- 12:25.040* :  very few people who got those details and told that story and got it outside of China.
*12:25.360- 12:30.880* :  And just remind us how paranoid the authorities in China were about any unfettered information
*12:30.880- 12:34.320* :  about COVID coming out of them. Oh, absolutely. I mean, it was a big deal
*12:34.320- 12:40.540* :  that her videos were being seen by millions of people. And that really angered the authorities.
*12:41.060- 12:46.520* :  You know, she was sentenced for picking quarrels and provoking trouble. She was given a four-year
*12:46.520- 12:51.540* :  sentence. Do we know how she was treated in prison? The only things we've really heard of are
*12:51.540- 12:57.500* :  messages that have been smuggled out via her mother. We believe she underwent several hunger strikes
*12:57.500- 13:02.600* :  and was force-fed via a feeding tube and lost a lot of weight. But Oliver, I don't think that
*13:02.600- 13:08.340* :  anybody is under the illusion that even when her official sentence ends today, she will
*13:08.340- 13:14.140* :  be allowed to continue living her life and will ever work again, either as an independent journalist
*13:14.280- 13:20.420* :  or as a lawyer. In fact, the group reporters without borders is expressing concern that like other
*13:20.420- 13:25.540* :  people who have angered the Chinese authorities by speaking out, she will be sent to some far off
*13:25.540- 13:31.340* :  village. She won't really be allowed to resume her contacts with her family or resume any of her
*13:31.720- 13:36.700* :  former past life. I mean, she really probably will go into some sort of house arrest we think
*13:36.700- 13:44.980* :  after today. The internet and online world in general are frequently cited as the source of
*13:44.980- 13:50.900* :  all manner of mental health problems. But a study of internet users in more than 160 countries
*13:50.900- 13:56.200* :  suggest the reverse could be the case. It says the majority of people who use the internet enjoy
*13:56.200- 14:01.860* :  a higher sense of well-being than women age 15 to 24 were the exception. One of the researchers
*14:01.860- 14:05.840* :  is Andrew Shabilsky from the University of Oxford. He spoke to Laura Maxwell.
*14:06.260- 14:09.700* :  This isn't to say that spending too much time on your phone doesn't make you miserable,
*14:09.700- 14:14.440* :  but it's more to say that when you zoom out and you look at something like the spread of the
*14:14.440- 14:18.820* :  internet or the spread of being able to use the internet on your phone across the world,
*14:18.820- 14:24.300* :  across the last 16 years, that on balance it might be a positive that levels of well-being
*14:24.300- 14:29.000* :  are between 5% and 8% higher for those that can access the internet and use the internet
*14:29.220- 14:33.720* :  on a daily basis. How do you measure that? Well, with millions of face-to-face interviews.
*14:34.080- 14:38.380* :  And so there's been a long-running study that again covers more than 160 countries going back
*14:38.380- 14:43.140* :  to 2005. And in the midst of asking people about how their lives were going and collecting
*14:43.140- 14:47.280* :  background in these face-to-face and sometimes telephone interviews, they also ask some questions
*14:47.280- 14:52.100* :  about how people communicate and how people connect. So what my colleague Mati, Viora, and I did
*14:52.100- 14:57.340* :  was be constructed a large statistical model to look at whether or not actually having access to
*14:57.340- 15:01.340* :  the internet and being able to use it on a mobile phone really to test instead of kind of
*15:01.680- 15:06.220* :  extrapolating from our personal experience of not enjoying our time on social media, let's say,
*15:06.660- 15:11.260* :  to look at the big picture. Well, I was just wondering, you looked at this across 160 countries and
*15:11.260- 15:16.680* :  I sort of think, well, we always hear from Northern Europe and perhaps Northern America about
*15:16.680- 15:22.900* :  the issues that we have with social media. But I suppose just actually being able to afford a
*15:22.900- 15:27.880* :  mobile phone, being able to get on the internet, improves people's lives across the board if you
*15:28.200- 15:32.340* :  live in a developing nation. Yes, that's entirely our way of thinking too, which is to say that we
*15:32.340- 15:37.140* :  were trying to compare people both within countries across time. So we weren't comparing people say
*15:37.140- 15:42.400* :  in the UK compared to people in France. We were comparing people within a country to each other.
*15:42.820- 15:49.020* :  So what does it mean to have access to the internet in Nigeria in 2008 versus 2015, let's say?
*15:49.480- 15:53.740* :  We take a lot for granted about what phones are the internet, the positive roles, the things
*15:53.740- 15:58.440* :  that it makes easier in our lives. I think we can take that for granted very easily when we focus
*15:58.440- 16:03.740* :  on the headlines and sometimes some tragic anecdotes. What were the biggest improvements in mental
*16:03.740- 16:09.120* :  health that you saw? Again, not improvements because it's all correlational. But no, we found that
*16:09.120- 16:14.580* :  life satisfaction and having positive experiences were the largest differences between people.
*16:14.900- 16:17.860* :  This was just making life enough a lot easier in some situations.
*16:18.520- 16:21.800* :  Were the findings universal or did it change depending on what continent you were on?
*16:22.220- 16:26.500* :  No, so we did look at all the continents and many, many different demographics and people from
*16:26.500- 16:31.720* :  different economic and educational backgrounds. And we did the numbers of different ways. We tested
*16:31.720- 16:36.980* :  more than 30,000 different ways of analyzing the data. And in half of 1% of cases, we found a
*16:36.980- 16:41.800* :  negative correlation between internet use and well-being. And this was mostly for young women,
*16:42.040- 16:46.680* :  15 to 24. And it turned out that if they didn't like the communities that they lived in,

*18:31.380- 18:34.460* :  This morning, Israel paused to honor its warded.
*18:44.140- 18:49.760* :  But even as Israelis marked Memorial Day, the Israeli defence forces continued their operations
*18:49.760- 18:55.760* :  in both northern and southern Gaza. Raffa on the border with Egypt has been a refuge for more
*18:55.760- 18:59.340* :  than a million Palestinians fleeing the conflict elsewhere in the territory.
*18:59.920- 19:04.160* :  But for the past week, they faced the agonizing decision over whether to move once again.
*19:04.680- 19:09.040* :  Among them, Khada El-Kherd, who's been displaced several times in the past seven months.
*19:09.740- 19:15.700* :  We were waiting for three days to evacuate because we were calling man with his truck,
*19:15.700- 19:19.520* :  but he was refusing to come because he said it's a dangerous area.
*19:19.780- 19:23.880* :  And we have to offer him a huge amount of money and order to come.
*19:23.880- 19:31.620* :  So, instead of being $100, you can pay $500 to any or 30 kilometers away from Raffa.
*19:31.980- 19:33.540* :  And we have to take our essential.
*19:34.020- 19:36.640* :  In the streets, all the streets are full of sewage.
*19:36.640- 19:40.460* :  Whenever you are walking, and on Deryl Belah also there is evidence of
*19:40.740- 19:42.620* :  previous carpet bombing in this area.
*19:42.620- 19:46.640* :  Like I was shocked when I came because whenever you are walking between the streets,
*19:47.220- 19:50.500* :  you can see the destruction of houses, the destruction of facilities.
*19:50.820- 19:53.280* :  It's so hard for us to be in seven months.
*19:53.280- 19:56.200* :  We are displaced from North to Middle-Area to Hanyun,
*19:56.200- 19:58.860* :  and then coming back to Middle-Area again.
*19:58.860- 20:00.620* :  It's like exhausted for us.
*20:00.880- 20:01.800* :  I woke up this morning.
*20:01.800- 20:04.300* :  I have like a huge pain in my body.
*20:04.580- 20:05.160* :  I'm so weak.
*20:05.220- 20:06.100* :  I'm so exhausted.
*20:06.200- 20:09.540* :  The most of them, they have tints and they are living under the heat,
*20:09.700- 20:12.460* :  under the lake of water, I like of food.
*20:12.660- 20:15.940* :  Now, all of us, we are suffering from stomach disease,
*20:15.940- 20:20.120* :  from allergic because of the unhealthy condition, unhealthy water.
*20:20.120- 20:22.160* :  So, really, we are losing weight.
*20:22.160- 20:24.680* :  So, if we didn't die from airstrikes,
*20:24.980- 20:27.300* :  the starvation, the famine that will happen.
*20:27.820- 20:29.900* :  Yada Al-Kurd in Rafa.
*20:30.100- 20:32.840* :  Well, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*20:32.840- 20:37.800* :  says the military operation in Rafa is necessary in order to eliminate Hamas,
*20:37.800- 20:40.220* :  deemed a terror group by many Western governments.
*20:41.000- 20:44.540* :  But even in northern Gaza, the first target of the offensive,
*20:44.980- 20:48.980* :  Hamas has regrouped in some areas and continued to launch attacks.
*20:49.680- 20:52.320* :  For words, it judges his professor of international relations
*20:52.320- 20:53.860* :  at the London School of Economics.
*20:53.860- 20:57.280* :  Julian Marshall asked him how degraded is Hamas?
*20:57.760- 21:01.100* :  Hamas has suffered probably thousands of casualties.
*21:01.700- 21:05.540* :  Some of its organized units in northern Gaza and Karnunis
*21:05.900- 21:09.440* :  and central Gaza have been probably dismantled.
*21:09.780- 21:13.780* :  But this does not really mean that Hamas is not functioning.
*21:13.780- 21:17.220* :  In fact, Hamas has been able to reorganize itself
*21:17.220- 21:20.760* :  and to wage gorilla warfare in northern Gaza,
*21:21.220- 21:23.620* :  in central Gaza, in Karnunis.
*21:23.800- 21:28.060* :  In fact, all the evidence we have is that Israel really does not control
*21:28.440- 21:31.100* :  any of the major urban centers in Gaza.
*21:31.620- 21:33.860* :  There are still major fighting in northern Gaza,
*21:34.360- 21:36.780* :  major fighting in Karnunis and central Gaza.
*21:37.160- 21:42.620* :  And this tells me that regardless of how many casualties Hamas will suffer,
*21:43.100- 21:46.980* :  Hamas will be able to continue to wage gorilla warfare for many years.
*21:47.940- 21:51.760* :  What Israel does not take into account, that Hamas is not a conventional army,
*21:52.000- 21:56.540* :  that Hamas basically is a very dynamic social movement.
*21:56.540- 22:00.160* :  It has prepared for this moment for many years.
*22:00.660- 22:02.000* :  It's very nimble.
*22:02.360- 22:07.760* :  And that's why I think that Gaza will likely hunt Israel in the same way
*22:07.760- 22:12.380* :  that Afghanistan and Iraq hunted the American army for many years.
*22:12.680- 22:16.600* :  Israel seems to believe that if it goes into
*22:17.160- 22:19.800* :  Raffa with the full-scale ground invasion,
*22:19.800- 22:22.560* :  it will finish the job of eliminating Hamas.
*22:22.720- 22:24.500* :  But you say that's not the case.
*22:25.340- 22:31.200* :  Well, according to the spokesperson of the US Defense Department,
*22:31.200- 22:33.320* :  just days ago, said quote unquote,
*22:33.320- 22:37.700* :  that Israel will never defeat Hamas strategically,
*22:37.700- 22:39.780* :  even if it takes over Raffa.
*22:40.240- 22:46.880* :  In fact, all the evidence shows that the Israeli army now is bogged down in Gaza.
*22:47.320- 22:50.520* :  And many American strategists believe that Gaza will likely
*22:50.540- 22:54.620* :  become a bleeding battlefield for the Israeli army.
*22:55.040- 22:59.280* :  What it really means that Israel has to occupy Gaza for many years.
*22:59.300- 23:02.440* :  It has to maintain tens of thousands of forces.
*23:03.160- 23:05.500* :  Because if history serves as a guide,
*23:06.260- 23:09.060* :  no army can really defeat an insurgency.
*23:09.060- 23:10.980* :  In particular, popular insurgents,
*23:11.300- 23:13.980* :  particular insurgency that's deeply entrenched
*23:14.440- 23:19.380* :  within the popular groups and populations in Gaza.
*23:19.880- 23:26.540* :  So even though Hamas has suffered major losses in terms of man and material,
*23:27.060- 23:28.380* :  Hamas is still functioning.
*23:28.380- 23:29.160* :  It's alive.
*23:29.180- 23:30.260* :  It's kicking.
*23:30.760- 23:31.960* :  And it's really pushing back.
*23:31.960- 23:36.400* :  We have reports of Israeli casualties on frequent bases
*23:37.060- 23:41.960* :  in some of the parts of Gaza that Israel said it basically was able to cleanse
*23:42.640- 23:45.480* :  and dismantle the organized forces of Hamas.
*23:46.060- 23:48.980* :  For us, judges of the London School of Economics.
*23:50.080- 23:52.880* :  An inquiry here in Britain is calling for a major
*23:52.880- 23:55.420* :  overhaul of maternity and post-natal care
*23:55.820- 23:59.500* :  after hearing what it calls harrowing evidence from more than a thousand women.
*24:00.080- 24:03.280* :  The birth trauma report is being presented to the UK government today.
*24:03.280- 24:05.040* :  We heard more from Chi Chi is under.
*24:05.680- 24:09.240* :  Let me just start by explaining what might be considered birth trauma.
*24:09.240- 24:13.700* :  It's a woman's experience of interactions or events directly related to childbirth
*24:13.700- 24:17.220* :  that caused an overwhelming, distressing, emotional reaction.
*24:17.340- 24:21.460* :  And that can include any injury sustained during birth.
*24:21.560- 24:24.740* :  This inquiry actually asked for written submissions
*24:24.740- 24:28.460* :  from anyone that had interacted during childbirth
*24:28.460- 24:33.420* :  and they got 1,300 submissions from people who'd experienced traumatic birth.
*24:33.420- 24:34.980* :  It's unlike you described.
*24:35.020- 24:39.180* :  The stories in this report have been described as harrowing.
*24:39.620- 24:44.780* :  They include accounts of stillbirth, premature babies, babies born with cerebral palsy
*24:44.780- 24:46.480* :  caused by oxygen deprivation.
*24:47.060- 24:48.980* :  The list goes on and on.
*24:48.980- 24:53.140* :  And the report concludes that the picture to emerge was of a maternity system
*24:53.140- 24:57.840* :  where poor care is all too frequently tolerated as normal
*24:57.980- 25:00.660* :  and women are treated as an inconvenience.
*25:01.140- 25:02.260* :  Chi Chi is undue.
*25:02.380- 25:04.500* :  Well, Leah Hazard is a midwife and author.
*25:04.500- 25:06.700* :  She says the report shows the need for change.
*25:07.160- 25:09.400* :  The testimony is absolutely sobering.
*25:09.680- 25:13.780* :  And unfortunately, a lot of the things that are described in the report are familiar to me
*25:13.780- 25:16.560* :  and will be familiar to many staff and service users.
*25:16.860- 25:18.360* :  You know, I've been a midwife for over 10 years.
*25:18.360- 25:22.060* :  And although most midwives, I get up every morning and try and do my best,
*25:22.240- 25:24.060* :  I know that things don't always go well.
*25:24.120- 25:26.860* :  I know that people aren't always treated the way they should be treated
*25:26.860- 25:29.380* :  and I know the working environment isn't what it should be.
*25:30.020- 25:32.860* :  So I think although the report is definitely bleak,
*25:33.300- 25:36.380* :  it's important that it is so candid because it simply highlights things
*25:36.440- 25:38.180* :  that many of us have been saying for many years.
*25:38.180- 25:42.960* :  Women's health and maternity care have just not been valued or prioritized
*25:43.580- 25:46.700* :  historically by society or by the government.
*25:47.360- 25:51.600* :  And I think what's shown in this report demonstrates that that really needs to change
*25:51.620- 25:55.500* :  because that minimization of the maternity journey
*25:55.500- 25:58.820* :  is taking an enormous toll on the people who move through the system.
*25:59.080- 26:00.260* :  And on those who work within it.
*26:02.580- 26:06.200* :  Violent crime is likely to be one of the big issues in South Africa's election
*26:06.200- 26:09.440* :  later this month with the murder rate there at a 20-year high.
*26:10.080- 26:11.560* :  Instead of relying on the police,
*26:11.560- 26:14.880* :  some communities are taking matters into their own hands.
*26:15.540- 26:17.840* :  As part of a BBC Africa Eye investigation,
*26:17.840- 26:21.780* :  I and a Charlie spent time with two volunteer patrols.
*26:22.240- 26:24.660* :  A team in the poor black township of Deep Slute
*26:25.100- 26:29.920* :  and a group called Afri Forum, which campaigns for the interests of mainly white of Ricanas.
*26:32.480- 26:35.780* :  It's Friday night and 41-year-old Abel Rapelejo
*26:35.820- 26:37.820* :  is getting his volunteer patrol together.
*26:42.160- 26:44.160* :  He's joined by two dozen men and women.
*26:44.380- 26:47.500* :  They're all concerned local residents of Deep Slute.
*26:48.100- 26:48.860* :  What are you searching for?
*26:49.040- 26:50.800* :  The weapons that might be heavy,
*26:51.080- 26:52.460* :  guns, knives.
*26:52.860- 26:56.160* :  We are facing the big challenge because Deep Slute is in the hands of the criminals.
*26:57.700- 26:58.780* :  60 kilometres away,
*26:59.120- 27:02.320* :  Johan Declack is also getting ready to lead a night patrol.
*27:03.180- 27:06.280* :  His in his early 40s and is joined by a dozen people.
*27:06.280- 27:10.520* :  They're mostly white farmers and are also volunteers from the local community.
*27:11.180- 27:11.940* :  What are you looking for?
*27:12.100- 27:15.680* :  Fences that has got footprints, the guys will go out to the farms
*27:15.860- 27:18.940* :  and cut the fences, still anything that is of value.
*27:21.480- 27:23.600* :  It's a few hours into the patrol with Abel.
*27:24.120- 27:27.040* :  Two local shopkeepers tell him they've just been robbed.
*27:28.200- 27:31.020* :  They see some people running away and catch one of them.
*27:31.300- 27:32.260* :  Just hold it up, guys.
*27:32.760- 27:35.300* :  But the shopkeepers tell them they've got the wrong guy.
*27:36.520- 27:40.980* :  One of the patrolers starts whipping him, while Abel interrogates him.
*27:44.640- 27:47.880* :  But there's no evidence that this man has done anything wrong.
*27:48.320- 27:48.940* :  Are you letting him go?
*27:49.380- 27:50.120* :  Yeah, we'll let him go.
*27:50.880- 27:52.240* :  There are clear dangers here.
*27:52.840- 27:54.520* :  Who holds these patrolers to account?
*27:55.340- 27:55.860* :  You beat him.
*27:56.520- 27:56.740* :  Yes.
*27:57.400- 27:58.760* :  What rights do you have to do that?
*27:58.760- 28:00.600* :  I remember Deep Slute is our place.
*28:01.140- 28:04.020* :  And if we don't fix that, no one will fix these Deep Slute.
*28:07.300- 28:09.360* :  Johan's patrol is well-resourced.
*28:09.740- 28:12.920* :  Most of them carry guns and wear bulletproof fists.
*28:14.540- 28:17.320* :  An hour into the patrol, they notice something suspicious.
*28:17.680- 28:18.340* :  Okay, all right.
*28:18.800- 28:19.180* :  What's happening?
*28:19.680- 28:20.700* :  This thing has been cut.
*28:21.240- 28:23.460* :  And you can see the footpath is well used.
*28:23.540- 28:24.220* :  Mm-hmm.
*28:24.780- 28:25.880* :  They follow the footpath.
*28:26.640- 28:28.180* :  It leads to an abandoned building.
*28:29.900- 28:32.480* :  The smoke, it means there was recent activity here.
*28:33.040- 28:36.060* :  It seems that whoever was here has been frightened off.
*28:36.980- 28:39.200* :  Why do they need for you to do this and not the police?
*28:39.600- 28:42.560* :  The police don't have the capacity to do the foot patrols.
*28:42.980- 28:43.700* :  It is provincial.
*28:44.260- 28:49.300* :  Since 2011, the number of police officers has decreased by 7%.
*28:50.440- 28:53.520* :  Unlike the farmers, Abel's unit is poorly equipped.
*28:54.220- 28:56.520* :  The risk to their lives is very real.
*28:57.840- 29:01.060* :  Two years ago, David's 21-year-old son, Alpha,
*29:01.360- 29:03.840* :  was shot and killed whilst out on patrol.
*29:04.420- 29:06.000* :  Unfortunately, he didn't make it.
*29:07.140- 29:08.560* :  Or he left a big gap in my life.
*29:09.260- 29:11.780* :  No one has ever been arrested for Alpha's murder.
*29:12.620- 29:15.320* :  According to the South African Institute of Security Studies,
*29:15.780- 29:19.000* :  the detection rate for murder is less than one in five.
*29:19.300- 29:21.200* :  And what do you think of the patrolers?
*29:21.520- 29:23.040* :  I really appreciate what that means.
*29:23.640- 29:26.180* :  But I pray that they can be safe.
*29:26.980- 29:28.480* :  There's no law in this place.
*29:29.180- 29:30.540* :  In a statement to the BBC,
*29:30.540- 29:33.000* :  a police ministry spokesperson said,
*29:33.360- 29:36.120* :  while we concede that crime is at unacceptable levels
*29:36.120- 29:37.740* :  in some parts of the country,
*29:38.080- 29:40.400* :  aggressive policing interventions have been
*29:40.400- 29:42.340* :  ushered in to improve the situation.
*29:43.080- 29:46.420* :  Any member of the community who takes the law into their own hands
*29:46.600- 29:48.460* :  will face the full might of the law.
*29:49.100- 29:51.340* :  A report from South Africa by Iander Charlie.
*29:52.120- 29:54.420* :  Now, here's some news which may interest some of you
*29:54.420- 29:57.580* :  and even the odd producer of the Global News podcast,
*29:57.580- 30:00.600* :  because today is World Cocktail Day.
*30:00.600- 30:03.860* :  An informal anniversary where drinkers have the perfect excuse
*30:03.860- 30:07.760* :  to swing by a bar for a swift gin fierce or Singapore sling.
*30:08.120- 30:10.940* :  I heard more from our cocktail correspondent, David Lewis.
*30:11.540- 30:14.840* :  Yes, the 13th of May today is World Cocktail Day.
*30:14.840- 30:15.800* :  Well, why that date?
*30:15.800- 30:18.360* :  It's automatically marked the moment in 1806
*30:18.360- 30:20.640* :  when the word was published for the first time
*30:21.160- 30:22.180* :  in a New York newspaper.
*30:22.180- 30:25.100* :  The balance and Colombian repository tabloid coined the term
*30:25.360- 30:28.760* :  Cocktail as a horse with a tail like a cock
*30:29.220- 30:30.720* :  cocked up instead of down.
*30:30.860- 30:33.260* :  Two things in one like a good mixed drink.
*30:33.340- 30:34.920* :  The paper described the booze as
*30:35.300- 30:36.240* :  a stimulating,
*30:36.240- 30:38.620* :  the cure composed of spirits of any kind,
*30:38.960- 30:40.480* :  sugar, water and bitters.
*30:40.740- 30:43.300* :  The mixed drink actually began life as a British invention,
*30:43.400- 30:44.280* :  but across the Atlantic,
*30:44.280- 30:45.900* :  the Americans innovated it.
*30:46.180- 30:48.740* :  And it was New York barkeeper, Jeremiah Thomas,
*30:48.740- 30:51.680* :  whose creations really popularized the drinks.
*30:51.680- 30:54.560* :  In 1862, he jotted his creations down
*30:54.560- 30:56.360* :  in his book The Bartender's Guide,
*30:56.800- 30:58.680* :  immortalizing the first quenches
*30:58.680- 31:00.040* :  that people still enjoy today.
*31:00.040- 31:01.700* :  The mint tulip appeared in his time,
*31:02.040- 31:06.120* :  as did the cognac brandy and vermouth mix the corpse reviver.
*31:06.360- 31:08.780* :  Fast forward 60 years to prohibition near America,
*31:08.780- 31:11.720* :  where bootleg alcohol illegally distilled
*31:11.720- 31:13.840* :  and flogged under threat of a police raid.
*31:13.840- 31:16.280* :  No doubt, wouldn't have tasted that great.
*31:16.400- 31:18.020* :  So shaken up with bitters and sodas,
*31:18.340- 31:19.600* :  more classics were created.
*31:19.600- 31:21.880* :  Rum mojitos, the sidecar,
*31:22.260- 31:24.180* :  and the Tom Collins were popularized then
*31:24.540- 31:26.320* :  and remain a saloon staple.
*31:26.580- 31:27.740* :  At the same time in Europe,
*31:27.740- 31:29.240* :  the trend setting in hedonistic,
*31:29.540- 31:31.880* :  bright young things of the roaring 1920s,
*31:32.000- 31:33.580* :  cuft cocktails for fun,
*31:34.180- 31:36.240* :  and the drink was here to stay.
*31:36.580- 31:37.800* :  So as cocktail correspondent,
*31:37.800- 31:39.920* :  what do you advise on world cocktail day?
*31:39.920- 31:40.220* :  What?
*31:40.720- 31:43.320* :  There's more emphasis this year on inclusive drinks.
*31:43.320- 31:45.140* :  I think of gluten-free cocktails,
*31:45.600- 31:47.400* :  drinks using plant-based milk,
*31:47.780- 31:49.420* :  and other vegan options too.
*31:49.420- 31:50.340* :  Here in Britain, at least,
*31:50.520- 31:53.060* :  there's also focus on a move away from sweet drinks
*31:53.060- 31:54.740* :  towards more savory inventions.
*31:55.200- 31:56.700* :  So this year, there's extra attention
*31:56.700- 31:59.500* :  on the spicy margarita and bloody Maria.
*31:59.500- 32:03.740* :  Or why not sub a cucumber wasabi martini this special day?
*32:04.500- 32:04.980* :  Chinchin?
*32:05.400- 32:09.320* :  Well, I may or may not be off to follow that advice from David Lewis.
*32:11.740- 32:12.920* :  And that's all from us for now,
*32:12.920- 32:15.600* :  but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:15.600- 32:17.700* :  This edition was mixed by Sid Dundin.
*32:17.700- 32:19.540* :  The producer is Nikki Verico,
*32:19.760- 32:20.940* :  our editor's Karen Martin.

*32:22.180- 32:23.300* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*32:32.420- 32:33.820* :  So, how did it happen?
*32:34.180- 32:36.440* :  Well, actually, that's a really important question.
*32:36.440- 32:38.940* :  The two countries were essentially enemies.
*32:39.320- 32:40.720* :  That is, of course, an allegation
*32:40.720- 32:41.640* :  that has been levelled.
*32:41.640- 32:44.520* :  Everybody had a different definition of what the problem was.
*32:44.720- 32:47.540* :  Let's remember the background of all these.
*32:48.020- 32:49.760* :  The explanation is the podcast
