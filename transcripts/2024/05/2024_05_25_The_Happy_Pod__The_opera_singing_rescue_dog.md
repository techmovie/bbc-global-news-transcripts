*01:27.820- 01:33.380* :  I'm Vanessa Heaney and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 25th of May, we meet Georgia,
*01:33.920- 01:35.380* :  the singing greyhound.
*01:42.120- 01:47.700* :  Who found her voice and a love of opera after being rescued. The man who nearly became
*01:47.700- 01:52.520* :  the first black astronaut finally makes it into space six decades later.
*02:01.900- 02:06.900* :  Meanwhile, spaceships of the future, as imagined by children fly over New York.
*02:17.900- 02:18.820* :  Many phones.
*02:20.180- 02:25.580* :  Also in this podcast, we meet the man who took on multi-billion dollar mining companies to
*02:25.580- 02:31.960* :  protect an Indian forest and one. When he first went to the forest, he found them so beautiful
*02:32.260- 02:38.800* :  that he was very surprised and shocked to hear that such a beautiful forest will be destroyed for
*02:38.800- 02:49.680* :  all my need. And listen to Julia, the goat whisperer.
*02:56.560- 03:03.000* :  Our first story covers an animal that makes me very happy, dogs. I have a beloved black
*03:03.000- 03:08.420* :  labrador called Olive, who's known as the favourite child in my family, but this story is about
*03:08.420- 03:11.400* :  a rather special greyhound, who sings.
*03:24.100- 03:28.680* :  This is six-year-old Georgia and her take on Mozart's Arya Queen of the Night,
*03:29.160- 03:32.440* :  along with her big human sister, eight-year-old Hannah Ompiano.
*03:33.240- 03:37.900* :  Georgia was a racing dog until a serious accident on the track three years ago.
*03:38.500- 03:42.360* :  She has now amassed a huge following on Instagram, including me.
*03:43.060- 03:46.740* :  She was rescued by the Albro family in Perth in Western Australia.
*03:47.400- 03:50.660* :  I caught up with Hannah and of course, Georgia, along with mum Jess.
*03:51.760- 03:56.980* :  Georgia was extremely anxious and stressed when she first arrived at our home.
*03:57.700- 04:03.240* :  It was obvious that it was the first time she'd ever been inside a house and she really had no idea
*04:03.240- 04:06.780* :  how to navigate normal things inside a home like doors and stairs.
*04:07.380- 04:12.360* :  And all of the sounds like TVs and things like that would just cause her to become extremely
*04:12.360- 04:17.260* :  distressed. She'd just pace around the house and as if she was lost and she just didn't know what
*04:17.260- 04:22.380* :  to do with herself and we gave her toys but she just looked at them and didn't know what to do with
*04:22.560- 04:28.760* :  them. She didn't make a sound when we first got her. She'd whimper as if she was scared
*04:28.760- 04:32.920* :  but she would never sting or bark or anything like that. We didn't even know that she could.
*04:33.660- 04:38.580* :  And my daughter started learning the piano and as soon as she started playing the piano,
*04:38.580- 04:46.680* :  Georgia would just join in and now it's just impossible for us to play a piano or have any
*04:46.680- 04:52.200* :  music on in the house without Georgia joining in. She didn't know she had this voice but
*04:52.200- 04:58.800* :  now we just can't turn it off. That's so lovely. I understand that Georgia is asleep at the moment
*04:59.000- 05:02.500* :  but I wondered if you might play something for us Hannah. Hello there.
*05:03.100- 05:07.900* :  Georgia, I hope you are listening even if you're asleep and I wondered if you might sing for us.
*05:07.900- 05:10.680* :  Our listeners would love that. Okay off you go.
*05:29.100- 05:30.980* :  On cue, that's so lovely.
*05:35.180- 05:41.300* :  Hannah, she certainly woke up and was in full voice. Did she have a favourite type of music?
*05:41.440- 05:49.040* :  Is there something she likes more than others? Well, she lives like the noise of the piano
*05:49.100- 05:56.320* :  and sometimes she sings to TV shows like Mary Poppins movie. And what do you think is her talent?
*05:56.320- 06:01.580* :  Does she got an airy that you think she's particularly good at? Yeah opera. A lot of people might
*06:01.580- 06:07.220* :  associate Greyhounds with racing but Georgia's story shows us that these dogs make wonderful
*06:07.220- 06:14.000* :  companions. Could you tell us about her role in your family and in your life? We didn't really know
*06:14.960- 06:20.040* :  about the plight of Greyhounds before we rescued Georgia but we were keen to sort of understand
*06:20.040- 06:24.900* :  where she'd come from, what she'd experienced and why. This beautiful three-year-old dog had
*06:24.900- 06:29.960* :  been discarded to us. She was perfect. But then what we found out was that there's a lot of
*06:30.320- 06:35.240* :  horrible things going on in the Greyhound Racing industry and yeah, Georgia's opened our eyes
*06:35.260- 06:40.260* :  to that whole world, introduced us to so many beautiful people that are all on the same page,
*06:40.700- 06:46.700* :  she's just changed our lives completely. Hannah, I wondered if you might play us one of your favorite
*06:46.700- 06:53.620* :  pieces and see if Georgia wants to join in too. Georgia, I hope you're still there. Do you have a
*06:53.620- 06:59.040* :  fine other song? Yep. Georgia seems to me awake. She's looking at me.
*07:20.700- 07:22.000* :  Thank you so much, Hannah.
*07:22.000- 07:30.680* :  What a duo. Hannah, I wondered if there was anything else you wanted to share.
*07:31.420- 07:40.880* :  Well, making music with my dog is one of my motivations to learn music and I love that she
*07:40.880- 07:51.000* :  cooperate with my piano and sings and she's the centre of our lives. She's what keeps us going.
*07:52.420- 07:58.940* :  Eight-year-old Hannah, Elbro, her mum Jess and their beloved Greyhound Georgia. We would really
*07:58.940- 08:04.380* :  love to hear from you about your talented pets. What can they do? Please do get in touch, send us
*08:04.380- 08:09.820* :  an email or a voice note and if you'd like to see more videos of Georgia singing, she's Georgia
*08:09.820- 08:17.780* :  the Grey on Instagram. Now, our next story is a case of better late than never. A man who originally
*08:17.780- 08:23.900* :  trained to be an astronaut back in the 1960s has finally made it into space, becoming the oldest
*08:23.900- 08:31.060* :  person ever to do so. Ed Dwight, who's 90 years old and a former Air Force pilot, was almost chosen as
*08:31.060- 08:35.580* :  the first black astronaut but didn't make the final cut. Jessica Wilkins has more.
*08:36.800- 08:40.000* :  Five, four. Command engine start, two.
*08:40.360- 08:46.440* :  America's oldest astronaut has finally taken off. 90-year-old Ed Dwight was originally
*08:46.440- 08:53.020* :  accounted for NASA's space programme back in 1963. He had the support of then-president John
*08:53.020- 08:59.760* :  F. Kennedy and had hoped to become America's first black astronaut. Unfortunately, NASA did not
*08:59.760- 09:05.520* :  select him for the programme. Last Sunday, he finally caught a ride in one of Jeff Bezos' rockets.
*09:06.540- 09:12.620* :  And here's the grand opportunity at this late date to fulfill that for self-satisfaction, yes,
*09:13.460- 09:19.120* :  but more importantly to satisfy all the wonderful people that have assured me with love for all
*09:19.120- 09:25.820* :  these years. The 10-minute trip made Mr Dwight a retired Air Force pilot, the oldest person ever to
*09:25.820- 09:31.300* :  go into space. Now a sculptor, he is two months older than the previous record holder,
*09:31.300- 09:36.220* :  Star Trek's William Shatner. When he was interviewed immediately after landing,
*09:36.780- 09:38.640* :  Mr Dwight sounded over the moon.
*09:39.020- 09:46.360* :  Hello, thank you, thank you, thank you. Absolutely fantastic, thank you.
*09:55.460- 10:00.200* :  We're going to stay with space now. Have you ever wondered about the future of space travel?
*10:00.920- 10:04.860* :  Well, some children around the world who be drawing what they think the spaceships they might
*10:04.860- 10:10.980* :  travel in will look like. Thousands sent in their designs and a few lucky winners had them turned into
*10:10.980- 10:17.140* :  drones by Lego designers and they blasted off into the skies of New York for a display of what
*10:17.140- 10:24.060* :  the organisers called unidentified playing objects. I spoke to 7-year-old Gillian from the US,
*10:24.060- 10:30.180* :  13-year-old Jace from Hong Kong and 10-year-old Sebastian from Denmark who told me about their
*10:30.180- 10:39.100* :  designs. It's like a straw hat with reindeer antlers and a rocket underneath the straw hat with
*10:39.100- 10:48.580* :  some reindeer ears. The straw hat is like because I love summer and it's a good hat and like
*10:49.080- 10:58.780* :  the antlers is like reindeer, I love Christmas and they can fly. The giant rocket, how else can
*10:58.780- 11:05.620* :  they fly around? I'm now going to say hello to Gillian. It's a dinosaur with a jetpack flying
*11:05.620- 11:14.300* :  to a dinosaur moon. There's a bunch of dinosaurs waiting for him to arrive on the moon from dinosaurs.
*11:15.220- 11:24.540* :  So why chose that because it'll because I like dinosaurs and all of that and I like really going
*11:24.540- 11:33.520* :  fast. Hi Jace, could you tell us about your design please Jace? My design, the spaceship is like
*11:33.520- 11:42.500* :  a dog and there's have many bones is surrounding my spaceship is like a little bit of pink. I want
*11:42.500- 11:52.640* :  to try and design more other kind of spaceship and also others of like transportation and I really
*11:52.640- 11:59.660* :  want to try design other things. How did it make you feel when you saw your design up in the sky
*11:59.660- 12:07.340* :  as a drone? Yes, I really feel so excited and I feel it really amazing because I never
*12:07.340- 12:14.160* :  thought about it will be my design in this base and I really happy about it. It was like really
*12:14.160- 12:22.760* :  amazing. I felt really really good and it was really pretty. I think I would never forget it.
*12:23.220- 12:29.960* :  It was pretty cool and amazing like the actions and the movements. And would you go, would you go
*12:29.960- 12:38.040* :  on the moon in the dinosaur? Would you like to go there too? Yeah, there'll be we can see a lot
*12:38.040- 12:43.480* :  of stars in a lot of planets. And would there be people living on them? Do you think or would it
*12:43.480- 12:49.960* :  just be dinosaurs? I think dinosaurs. And do you think that you might go to space one day when
*12:49.960- 12:55.960* :  you're older? Are you interested in maybe going to space being an astronaut? Yeah, there's going
*12:55.960- 13:04.940* :  to be a dinosaur on it with a tail. I think it could be fun to travel out to another universe
*13:04.940- 13:11.680* :  to your destination. I really want to go to space because I think space is a really amazing
*13:11.680- 13:18.920* :  place and I think it will be super beautiful. Gillian, Jason and Sebastian talking about their
*13:18.920- 13:26.440* :  drone designs for Lego. We've been asking for your stories of meeting people you know in unexpected

*16:53.840- 16:59.280* :  Now to the story about a man who took on the call industry to save a forest and one.
*17:00.280- 17:05.780* :  Alok Shukla fell in love with a Hastio Arunia forest in central India home to thousands of
*17:05.780- 17:12.160* :  tribes people endangered animals and rare plants. So much so he dedicated his life to stopping
*17:12.160- 17:18.560* :  multi-billion dollar companies uprooting the trees in their search for coal. 12 years later
*17:18.560- 17:25.200* :  after online campaigns protests in the capital and tree sit-ins he has saved a huge area of the
*17:25.200- 17:31.260* :  forest known as the lungs of Chattaskar and been awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize
*17:31.260- 17:37.700* :  also known as the Green Nobel Prize. I spoke to Alok with the help of his friend and interpreter
*17:38.280- 17:41.760* :  Priyanshu Gupta and asked why the forest is so special.
*17:46.420- 17:52.080* :  Thank you so much for the opportunity to convey the thoughts and feelings. When he first went to
*17:52.080- 17:58.740* :  the forest he found them so beautiful, so rich that he was very surprised and shocked to hear that
*17:58.740- 18:06.100* :  such a beautiful natural forest will be destroyed for coal mining and it is then that he felt
*18:06.480- 18:13.360* :  what is the point of all the talks about mitigating climate change if we do not preserve forests
*18:13.360- 18:20.240* :  like Hasevarani. The forest is not just special to you. Tell us about all the people and the
*18:20.240- 18:29.060* :  animals and the communities that live there. The richest forests in India are precisely where
*18:29.060- 18:35.300* :  tribal population has been living. So in many ways these forests exist because of these
*18:35.300- 18:41.580* :  tribal. In turn the tribal or Adiwati as we call them in India they depend completely on these
*18:41.580- 18:47.180* :  forests for their livelihood but also for the cultural identity their festival close to 25
*18:47.180- 18:54.520* :  endangered wildlife species of mammals, thousands of birds and other flora and fauna
*18:54.520- 19:02.300* :  survives in in in Havevaran forest and most important this is the elephant habitat where a large
*19:02.300- 19:08.580* :  a significant elephant population thrives. Did you ever think that you would you would have to
*19:08.580- 19:17.460* :  give up? How did you keep going? What he said is it firstly it is important to recognize that
*19:17.460- 19:23.240* :  it's been a long struggle and the struggle has not really ended it is still ongoing but the
*19:23.240- 19:30.980* :  question you raised is very important. How did we keep hope and optimism? Definitely it's been a
*19:30.980- 19:38.100* :  big challenge. So for Alok the hope comes from when he goes and meets people the Adiwati community
*19:38.100- 19:43.260* :  who are living in these forests and they are determined to save their forests at every cost.
*19:43.720- 19:48.340* :  This message from the local Adiwati that give me hope to continue fighting.
*19:49.260- 19:55.220* :  So it's a huge achievement you've managed to save a lot of forest and you've brought together
*19:55.220- 20:01.940* :  so many people as well as the people who live in the communities in the forest to do this this must
*20:01.940- 20:12.300* :  be an amazing feeling. Obviously it is a very happy moment so that one has been recognized
*20:12.300- 20:20.220* :  globally when I started on this journey it never ever occurred to me that I will ever be standing
*20:20.220- 20:26.100* :  on an international platform. So definitely it is a very very happy moment it's it is a big success
*20:26.100- 20:32.940* :  but more importantly it is actually the success for the people of Josef because finally the voice
*20:32.940- 20:40.500* :  of the local Adiwati has now reached an international platform and it is able to attract
*20:40.940- 20:47.260* :  in some sense a global solidarity. I also feel a lot of responsibility. We have won this
*20:48.160- 20:54.960* :  award but how do we use it to further the struggles? Yes we all need development but
*20:54.960- 21:02.000* :  development at what cost especially in this era of climate change. How can I now play my
*21:02.000- 21:10.160* :  responsibility of lending support to that cause as well? So in some sense I see both happy
*21:10.860- 21:13.620* :  as well as burdened with a sense of responsibility.
*21:19.020- 21:25.840* :  Alok Shukler and his interpreter Prianche Gupta. Time for a few other stories we spotted this week.
*21:32.540- 21:38.020* :  Perhaps the sound of Diego Elias becoming South America's first ever squash world champion.
*21:38.020- 21:44.120* :  The 27-year-old claimed victory over the former World No. 1 Mustafa Assal in the men's final.
*21:44.780- 21:49.800* :  Speaking at the tournament in Cairo Elias said it was going to be a big deal for his fans in Peru.
*21:50.740- 21:56.820* :  I just can't believe it. I still don't know how it's going to be but I think I know it's going to be
*21:56.820- 22:02.080* :  it's going to be huge. It's going to be massive in Peru. All the people that's been following me
*22:02.080- 22:08.260* :  for so many years and yeah to be honest I don't even know how I feel right now. I still don't
*22:08.300- 22:15.620* :  I haven't processed it yet and just just very happy. A man who is renovating his wine cellar in Austria
*22:16.000- 22:22.040* :  has made an extraordinary discovery. Not a bottle of vintage red or white but the remains of at least
*22:22.040- 22:28.680* :  three prehistoric mammoths. Andreas Pernestorfer made the find whilst renovating his cellar.
*22:29.140- 22:34.520* :  He told the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ORF that at first he thought it was just a piece of
*22:34.520- 22:39.860* :  wood left by his grandfather but then he remembered that in the past his grandfather had found teeth
*22:39.860- 22:47.080* :  and he thought it might be a mammoth. Archaeologists estimate the bones are between 30,000 and 40,000 years old.
*22:48.640- 22:54.060* :  The French post office has rolled out a scratch and sniffed postage stamp to celebrate the world
*22:54.060- 23:00.220* :  famous baguette. The stamp which costs just over two dollars shows the distinctive loaf of bread
*23:00.220- 23:06.840* :  decorated with a blue, white and red ribbon. The ink used on the stamps contains micro capsules
*23:06.840- 23:11.940* :  which provide the bakery fragrance when scratched. Stamp collectors need to act quickly though
*23:11.940- 23:18.840* :  as there's a limited print run. Now in the art world many artists wait years for some sort of
*23:18.840- 23:24.880* :  recognition of their talent. In the case of Vincent Van Gogh, fame didn't come until after his death
*23:25.620- 23:31.680* :  but for one garnet and artist it's all come a little bit sooner than expected as Rebecca Wood reports.
*23:32.760- 23:38.780* :  How to walk, how to talk, how to eat real food. Just some of the skills that a typical one and a
*23:38.780- 23:44.980* :  half year old might be attempting to master but not Ace Liam Nana Sam Ancroff from Ghana,
*23:45.560- 23:53.420* :  ages one year and 152 days old. He's entered the Guinness World Records as the world's youngest male
*23:53.420- 24:00.440* :  painter. His paintings are usually vibrant, extremely abstract. From the age of 11 months
*24:01.300- 24:07.340* :  he's good at complementing the colors he chooses and the says that if he chooses green he knows
*24:07.340- 24:11.380* :  the matches pink and he knows which shade of pink it matches with.
*24:11.740- 24:18.220* :  That's his mother, Chantal Cooca Egan. An artist too she needed to find a way to keep Ace Liam busy
*24:18.220- 24:24.320* :  while she worked. So at just six months old she got him rolling around on canvas with some paint
*24:24.320- 24:30.300* :  and it's then she realised his potential talent. At that stage he couldn't even hold a brush.
*24:30.540- 24:35.980* :  He will try and grab the colour and squeeze it in between his fingers and then spread it out.
*24:36.180- 24:42.620* :  And then at the end when it dried I raised the canvas and it had turned into something beautiful
*24:42.620- 24:48.720* :  so I was like okay this could be part of his playtime then. But playtime soon turned into professional
*24:48.720- 24:54.580* :  pieces. In order to qualify for the record Ace Liam needed to be part of a public exhibition
*24:54.580- 25:01.660* :  and sell his work. So a few months ago his work was exhibited at the Museum of Science and Technology
*25:01.660- 25:08.880* :  in the capital Acra. Not only that but he sold nine out of ten works on display and was even
*25:08.880- 25:15.020* :  commissioned to make a piece by the first lady of Ghana. So how was he handling at all at such a young
*25:15.020- 25:20.920* :  age? He's usually hyper and just like any toddler hyper they're just exploring the world
*25:21.340- 25:27.700* :  but when you see him painting he's so focused. He looks like an elderly artist that has been doing
*25:27.700- 25:33.020* :  this for years. I'm pretty sure he's aware now because those one time I told him he was the
*25:33.020- 25:38.140* :  Guinness World Record Holder and his reaction alone he wasn't in the box and saying he was just
*25:38.140- 25:45.500* :  thinking Guinness Guinness Guinness. Chantal's hope as the record will help raise the profile of art
*25:45.500- 25:51.660* :  in her country. As for Ace Liam her dream is an international scholarship to continue to grow his
*25:51.660- 25:58.200* :  artistic talent but in the meantime he can be founded his own studio surrounded by bright
*25:58.200- 26:06.460* :  pinks and greens and yellows ready to create his next masterpiece. Watch this space that was Rebecca
*26:06.460- 26:12.840* :  Wood reporting. Now we started with an animal singing like a human so we thought we'd end with
*26:12.840- 26:17.880* :  humans sounding like animals. Over the past few weeks we've heard from a nine-year-old boy who
*26:17.880- 26:23.380* :  sounds like a seagull and a five-year-old girl who does a great impression of a lion. So of course
*26:23.380- 26:29.880* :  we asked you for your animal noises. Hi my name is Julia Lawrence I'm from Stanford California
*26:29.900- 26:34.380* :  in the United States and I've been told I can do a pretty good goat noise.
*26:40.620- 26:46.200* :  Brilliant. Back clip made the happy pod team really laugh but it also left us with many questions
*26:46.320- 26:50.600* :  so we asked Julia to tell us more including how she first learned she could sound like a goat.
*26:51.400- 26:57.340* :  I have many fond memories of my mother taking me to the Woodland Park Zoo as a child and
*26:57.960- 27:03.220* :  one in particular stands out which is I was waiting for her to use the restroom in the farm section.
*27:04.200- 27:09.860* :  I must have been seven or eight at the time and while I was idling by the goats I decided to try
*27:09.860- 27:16.460* :  to imitate their noise. They're bleeding. I remember showing my mom when she came outside and she
*27:16.460- 27:23.460* :  was quite amused when they called back and the peculiar ability I wouldn't call it a talent
*27:24.540- 27:30.720* :  has been following me ever since. My boyfriend was surprised to realize I could make this unpleasant
*27:31.460- 27:38.280* :  noise when we were hiking in Italy back in 2017 on Elba Island we're going up from Porto Azuro
*27:38.300- 27:46.420* :  to the Madonna di Montserratto Sanctuary and we happened upon a small herd. I let out my bleat
*27:46.480- 27:54.220* :  and they paused called back and started walking toward us and to my relief my boyfriend was more
*27:54.220- 28:01.060* :  amused than horrified and we're still together some six years later so he can't have minded that much
*28:02.100- 28:07.020* :  but just this past fall we stopped off and cost a Greek island after a wedding in Turkey
*28:07.020- 28:13.120* :  and once again came upon a group of goats this time crossing the road in front of our rental car
*28:13.780- 28:19.720* :  and he begged me on to let out my goat sound and they once again paused and called back.
*28:31.300- 28:37.480* :  The most recent use of my bleat though has been as a goat stand-in at a friend's Passover
*28:37.480- 28:42.400* :  satire dinner. I'm a law student and for the past three years a group of friends has kindly
*28:42.400- 28:49.520* :  included me in their annual tradition of singing Hadgadya in which they assign students roles
*28:50.420- 28:54.940* :  and let's just say I'm glad to have been assigned the goat and not the butcher.
*28:59.360- 29:06.140* :  Fabulous thanks so much Julia well if you think you or your children can do better please do send us a
*29:06.140- 29:17.360* :  recording and that's all from us now remember if you'd like to be part of the happy pod we'd also
