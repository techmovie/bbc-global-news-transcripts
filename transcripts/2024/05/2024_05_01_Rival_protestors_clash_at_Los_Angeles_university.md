*00:46.980- 00:52.120* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices
*00:52.120- 00:54.040* :  due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:54.460- 00:57.060* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.060- 01:00.820* :  owners to your contracts, they said what the f**k are you talking about?
*01:00.820- 01:02.440* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:24.800- 01:29.240* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 1st of May.
*01:29.720- 01:30.780* :  These are our main stories.
*01:30.860- 01:36.500* :  Violence has erupted at a university in Los Angeles between pro-Palestinian protesters
*01:37.100- 01:38.700* :  and arrival groups awarding Israel.
*01:38.700- 01:43.720* :  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has met Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel
*01:43.720- 01:49.100* :  after accusing her mass of being the only remaining obstacle to a ceasefire in Gaza.
*01:49.780- 01:53.400* :  And we'll hear from an Iraqi man whose young daughter died last week
*01:53.700- 01:56.720* :  as their family tried to reach Britain in an overcrowded boat.
*01:58.840- 02:04.180* :  Also in this podcast, the lucky teenager in Australia who caught a million dollar fish.
*02:04.840- 02:05.440* :  And...
*02:05.640- 02:08.120* :  They do the dangerous things for us, they take the hits.
*02:08.460- 02:11.700* :  When you understand what they're risking personally and physically,
*02:11.700- 02:14.540* :  it only deepens your appreciation for what they do.
*02:14.940- 02:20.140* :  Actor Ryan Gosling on his new film, The Fall Guy, and a growing appreciation of stuntmen.
*02:24.460- 02:26.020* :  We begin in the United States.
*02:32.380- 02:35.840* :  Universities across the US have been gripped by protests,
*02:35.840- 02:40.740* :  as students demand a boycott of companies and individuals with ties to Israel.
*02:40.740- 02:46.540* :  In a moment we'll be hearing from New York, where overnight police arrested dozens of protesters.
*02:47.240- 02:50.340* :  But first to Los Angeles and the UCLA campus.
*02:50.940- 02:54.000* :  As we record this podcast, police are on the scene.
*02:54.000- 02:59.580* :  Pro-Palestinian protesters have been confronted by counter demonstrators supporting Israel.
*02:59.580- 03:04.940* :  A local journalist, Sergio Olmos, spoke to the BBC's Lucy Hawking's from the scene.
*03:05.380- 03:10.180* :  Police are holding a line just outside of the camp, and they've swept the area where the
*03:10.180- 03:14.320* :  counter protesters were clashing with the Palestinian demonstrators here.
*03:14.900- 03:18.020* :  For about an hour, there was no police presence.
*03:18.500- 03:21.240* :  Counter protesters were fighting with the Palestinian demonstrators.
*03:21.240- 03:23.120* :  They came out at night, just after midnight.
*03:23.120- 03:27.460* :  They launched fireworks into the encampment and tried to bring down the encampment,
*03:27.560- 03:30.960* :  going into the wooden fence there and try to bring it down,
*03:30.960- 03:35.660* :  hit people with sticks, throw bottles, in some cases, glass bottles, and there was pepper sprays.
*03:36.000- 03:40.640* :  So, Sergio, was it a case that the police worked there at all or they were there and didn't interfere?
*03:41.480- 03:42.540* :  No, they didn't intervene.
*03:42.540- 03:47.920* :  So, I got here about 12-20 in the morning, and for about an hour, the clashes were going on.
*03:48.240- 03:50.040* :  Police got here at 145 in the morning.
*03:50.040- 03:52.200* :  They formed a line about a few hundred feet away.
*03:52.660- 03:54.580* :  But then for another hour, just stood there.
*03:54.580- 03:55.640* :  They did not intervene.
*03:55.640- 03:58.780* :  Once they got closer, stood between the morning.
*03:59.080- 04:00.780* :  That's when the counter protesters stepped away.
*04:00.780- 04:05.740* :  They chanted USA, USA, and left, and there was no visible arrest on either side.
*04:05.740- 04:10.720* :  But the police stood there for about an hour watching as demonstrators and counter demonstrators
*04:11.440- 04:13.080* :  were clashing in front of each other.
*04:13.120- 04:15.820* :  Police did not take a attack of intervention here.
*04:15.960- 04:17.320* :  They have brought their gas masks out.
*04:17.320- 04:22.120* :  They do have batons, but they did not intervene and tonight's mailings.
*04:22.760- 04:26.760* :  And so, Sergio, do we know what it is that precipitated this violence tonight?
*04:26.760- 04:28.180* :  Was there a particular incident?
*04:29.700- 04:31.360* :  Well, this has been building up since Thursday.
*04:31.680- 04:33.120* :  There has been a screen behind you.
*04:33.120- 04:36.060* :  That's what's put on by these counter demonstrators.
*04:36.060- 04:38.740* :  They wanted to show support for Israel.
*04:38.740- 04:42.400* :  They wanted to have a counter narrative to what the Palestinian demonstrators are doing here.
*04:42.880- 04:44.100* :  But there's been a lot of anger building.
*04:44.100- 04:49.140* :  And so tonight, what you saw was this kind of group of mostly men come out
*04:49.300- 04:50.440* :  to fight with them.
*04:50.440- 04:52.420* :  They did come out to fight and fight they did.
*04:53.020- 04:57.020* :  And the police response was kind of to just let them go out of either,
*04:57.020- 04:58.840* :  because the police did not have enough numbers,
*04:58.840- 05:03.100* :  or they just did not have a plan for what would happen when counter demonstrators came,
*05:03.380- 05:05.720* :  you know, with the idea of violence.
*05:06.480- 05:09.980* :  Have you managed to speak to any of those involved, any of the protesters?
*05:10.060- 05:11.560* :  What sort of things have they been saying?
*05:12.420- 05:14.220* :  Well, they were shouting a lot of things.
*05:14.220- 05:15.200* :  There's a lot of anger.
*05:15.200- 05:18.520* :  Some of it, not, you know, not stuff you can repeat on air.
*05:18.760- 05:19.980* :  But they really came out to fight.
*05:19.980- 05:21.240* :  It was a lot of younger men.
*05:21.840- 05:26.700* :  Sergio Olmos in LA and overnight at Columbia University in New York,
*05:26.700- 05:32.280* :  police officers in riot gear climbed a ladder to enter the second floor of Hamilton Hall.
*05:32.300- 05:36.880* :  This building have been taken over by pro-Palestinian protesters a day before.
*05:36.940- 05:43.100* :  Windows had been smashed and this proved to be a red line for Columbia University officials.
*05:43.780- 05:44.820* :  Dozens were arrested.
*05:45.240- 05:49.360* :  A reporter with CBS Jared Hill described the situation there this morning.
*05:49.960- 05:53.960* :  Columbia University, just from a geographical standpoint, is in the middle of New York City.
*05:53.960- 05:56.600* :  It sits between two major avenues.
*05:56.600- 06:00.980* :  The entrance right here behind me, which is traditionally the main entrance for the school,
*06:00.980- 06:06.120* :  is locked off only one way in and out only students who live on campus,
*06:06.540- 06:11.880* :  as well as any essential faculty or staff who need to be on campus or being allowed onto the campus.
*06:12.420- 06:18.300* :  There's also the question here regarding some of the consequences for any of the protesters who
*06:18.300- 06:21.800* :  are on the campus, both inside the building as well as in the encampment.
*06:22.120- 06:26.840* :  There is the possibility that we could see charges ranging from burglary to trespassing
*06:26.840- 06:31.040* :  in this really conduct and so hopefully we can get some more information on that as well as
*06:31.040- 06:35.420* :  some of the specific numbers of exactly how many people were taken into custody,
*06:35.420- 06:40.060* :  how many of them were students and again with those consequences could be from a legal standpoint
*06:40.060- 06:42.080* :  as well as from the university.
*06:42.600- 06:48.720* :  Jared Hill, with no end in sight to the war in Gaza, the US Secretary of State is once again
*06:48.720- 06:51.900* :  in Israel to try to push for a new 40-day true steel.
*06:52.300- 06:55.640* :  He says it's up to her mass to agree to what Israel's put on the table,
*06:55.640- 07:00.100* :  but it's not that straightforward as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems determined
*07:00.100- 07:03.160* :  to launch a military offensive in Raffa, come what may.
*07:03.660- 07:06.300* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem is Yolanda now.
*07:06.960- 07:11.040* :  What we're seeing on this visit is continuing to put the onus on Hamas to accept a new deal.
*07:11.040- 07:13.640* :  He's saying no more delays, no more excuses.
*07:13.820- 07:19.640* :  He says that the offer that's been put by Israel, the latest one is extraordinarily generous
*07:20.140- 07:26.820* :  and we understand it involves a 40-day ceasefire in return for some 33 vulnerable hostages
*07:27.260- 07:33.120* :  still held in Gaza being released and that would be in exchange for a much larger number of
*07:33.120- 07:36.720* :  Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails being freed as well.
*07:36.720- 07:41.520* :  We're expecting Hamas leaders to reply within the coming day.
*07:42.060- 07:46.260* :  Otherwise, almost to Blinkens here, we're hearing a lot of focus about aid.
*07:46.260- 07:52.280* :  He's already met the Israeli President and he said that even as we're working with a relentless
*07:52.280- 07:57.480* :  determination to get the ceasefire, we've also got to focus on people in Gaza for suffering
*07:57.480- 08:02.320* :  in this crossfire of Hamas' making, focusing on getting them the assistance they need,
*08:02.320- 08:04.680* :  the food, medicine, water or shelter.
*08:05.100- 08:09.420* :  And he said there's been real and important progress in recent weeks but more needs to be done.
*08:09.840- 08:14.140* :  Otherwise, there's also a lot of talk going on that we've heard particularly in the last day or so
*08:14.140- 08:19.860* :  from Israeli leaders about the international criminal court with Israeli officials concerned
*08:19.860- 08:25.320* :  that they could see arrest warrants accusing them of war crimes being issued in the coming days.
*08:25.320- 08:28.240* :  There's been no official comment on that from the court,
*08:28.240- 08:32.780* :  but Washington has already said that it doesn't support the ICC investigation here.
*08:32.780- 08:37.600* :  It doesn't believe that it has jurisdiction here, but that is something that is going on in the
*08:37.600- 08:44.180* :  background. And as the diplomatic efforts continue, Mr Blinken, as you say, is putting the onus
*08:44.180- 08:50.640* :  on Hamas. But yesterday on Tuesday, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an assault
*08:50.640- 08:54.980* :  on Raffa would go ahead regardless of whether there's an agreement.
*08:55.700- 08:58.580* :  What might Mr Blinken be saying to Israel about that?
*08:59.500- 09:03.800* :  Yeah, I mean, if you look at what analysts are saying about Mr Netanyahu's latest comments,
*09:03.800- 09:07.500* :  I mean, there are those who point out that this is what he's been saying for weeks that Israel
*09:07.500- 09:13.740* :  will not stop the war before achieving all of its goals in his eyes that it has to go into Raffa
*09:13.740- 09:18.600* :  in the very south of the Gaza Strip because there are remaining Hamas battalions there.
*09:19.020- 09:21.700* :  Hamas, of course, wants a permanent end to the war.
*09:21.700- 09:27.180* :  This could well affect those deliberations by Hamas leaders that are going on at the moment.
*09:27.700- 09:31.160* :  Washington and others have been warning against a Raffa operation because
*09:31.680- 09:36.320* :  that part of the Gaza Strip now is so densely crowded close to one and a half million people
*09:36.320- 09:39.640* :  living there mostly displaced by the fighting elsewhere in this strip.
*09:39.640- 09:44.220* :  And there have been warnings from the likes of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres that
*09:44.220- 09:49.000* :  this could really cause an unbearable escalation killing thousands more civilians,
*09:49.000- 09:51.800* :  forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.
*09:52.360- 09:57.200* :  It's not really clear whether Mr Netanyahu does not believe in the deal, whether he's on the
*09:57.200- 10:00.820* :  side of those on the far right in his coalition government who want to prioritize
*10:00.820- 10:07.000* :  entering Raffa over a hostage deal at this point, or whether he's also speaking, which some say
*10:07.260- 10:11.400* :  is to keep his coalition government intact because you do have these far right ministers who
*10:11.400- 10:15.580* :  have key roles making thinly veiled threats to bring down the government
*10:15.580- 10:19.340* :  if there is a reckless deal that prevents a Raffa operation.
*10:19.920- 10:24.760* :  So it's really not clear at the moment what effects that could have, but definitely that will be
*10:24.760- 10:26.480* :  a part of his talks with Mr Blinken.
*10:26.940- 10:33.040* :  Yolanda Nell. Now last week our correspondent Andrew Harding was on the French coast south of Calais
*10:33.400- 10:37.400* :  and he witnessed people boarding an overloaded boat to cross the English Channel.
*10:38.060- 10:44.460* :  Five people died in that crossing including a child Sarah. Andrew has been speaking to her father
*10:45.060- 10:48.220* :  and we should warn listeners that they might find this report distressing.
*10:49.380- 10:54.220* :  It's just over a week since I stood on a beach here in Northern France before dawn and watched
*10:54.260- 10:57.060* :  a series of shocking events play out in the deal.
*10:59.480- 11:02.480* :  A group of migrants who smuggled us clashing with police.
*11:03.740- 11:07.460* :  There were firecrackers, smoke grenades, young men wielding iron bars.
*11:08.340- 11:14.460* :  Then a huge crowd clambered into one small inflatable boat which began drifting out to sea.
*11:14.960- 11:21.680* :  Desperately overloaded. I could see a child briefly clinging onto a man's shoulders and disappearing.
*11:23.140- 11:24.880* :  Then I heard someone shout for help.
*11:27.020- 11:33.440* :  A week on and we now know the child was a seven-year-old girl Sarah and it was her father,
*11:33.580- 11:39.280* :  Ahmed Al-Hashimi, who shouted for help, but Sarah slipped from his grasp and was crushed to death
*11:39.420- 11:43.240* :  beneath him in the crowded boat. One of five dead that morning.
*11:44.100- 11:51.120* :  Although Sarah had never been to Iraq, her father Ahmed was born there. He left the country in 2009
*11:51.120- 11:56.760* :  saying he felt unsafe and that he hoped to settle in Europe. He moved to Belgium,
*11:56.760- 12:04.180* :  to Sweden, to Finland, had three children, but at no point did Ahmed succeed in what he said
*12:04.180- 12:10.860* :  were 14 attempts to gain asylum. So when in February the family received word that they might
*12:10.860- 12:17.600* :  all be deported to Iraq, Ahmed settled on what he called his final option, a smuggler's boat
*12:17.600- 12:25.980* :  across the channel. Now, one week after Sarah's death, Ahmed has agreed to return to the beach here
*12:25.980- 12:31.560* :  at Wimmera to explain what happened and why he put his family in such danger.
*12:33.780- 12:39.640* :  People kept piling on. They didn't care if they were stepping on a child. People started to
*12:39.640- 12:46.600* :  suffocate. Sarah said, help me that, but I couldn't reach her. I was trapped. I'm a strong man,
*12:46.600- 12:52.620* :  a builder, but I couldn't budge. I told another man to move. I screamed and hit him, but he just
*12:52.620- 13:05.560* :  looked away. Finally when the rescue boat came, they started to pull people out. Then I saw Sarah.
*13:05.800- 13:09.820* :  She was in the corner. Her face was blue. She wasn't breathing.
*13:20.620- 13:27.120* :  The sea was my last option. I applied 14 times for asylum, but they were all denied.
*13:28.000- 13:34.800* :  All I wanted was for my kids to go to school. I didn't want any handouts. My wife and I can
*13:34.800- 13:41.900* :  both work. I just wanted to protect them and their childhood. What would people do if they were
*13:41.900- 13:50.760* :  in my position? Ahmed is wrestling with grief and rage, and yes, with guilt. He's due to collect
*13:50.760- 13:56.780* :  Sarah's death certificate later today. Then, at some point, there'll be a funeral here in France.
*13:57.540- 14:02.500* :  There will certainly be more migrants coming here, more deaths on these beautiful beaches.
*14:03.360- 14:08.780* :  And more questions, too, for the French police. Could they have done more? Being better prepared?
*14:09.620- 14:16.140* :  Or is this a crisis that will never be resolved, as long as there are families who see no other option
*14:16.420- 14:22.180* :  who are willing to risk everything, even death in the dark at sea, in a slow motion,
*14:22.200- 14:26.500* :  stampede, like the one that took the life of seven-year-old Sarah?
*14:28.100- 14:34.580* :  That was Andrew Harding. The American author, Paul Orster, best known for his award-winning,
*14:34.580- 14:40.820* :  The New York Trilogy, has died at the age of 77. He'd been suffering from lung cancer. He wrote
*14:40.820- 14:46.400* :  more than 30 books across his career, many were set in Brooklyn where he lived, and often played
*14:46.400- 14:52.200* :  with themes of coincidence, chance, and fate. Here he is reading the beginning of City of Glass,
*14:52.200- 14:58.600* :  the first story in The New York Trilogy. It was a wrong number that started it. The telephone
*14:58.600- 15:04.120* :  ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone,
*15:04.120- 15:09.660* :  he was not. Much later, when he was able to think about the things that happened to him,
*15:10.500- 15:16.520* :  he would conclude that nothing was real except chance. But that was much later. In the beginning,
*15:16.520- 15:21.580* :  there was simply the event and its consequences. Whether it might have turned out differently,
*15:21.580- 15:25.820* :  or whether it was all predetermined with the first word that came from the stranger's mouth,
*15:25.820- 15:32.080* :  is not the question. The question is the story itself, and whether or not it means something,
*15:32.080- 15:38.740* :  is not for the story to tell. The arts journalist Vincent Dowd told us more about Paul Orster.
*15:39.500- 15:44.320* :  Orster was born in New York, New Jersey, though he'll go down in literary history as a New York writer.
*15:44.640- 15:48.260* :  Sometimes he wrote, as you just said, about Brooklyn where he lived for the latter half of his
*15:48.300- 15:53.620* :  life in Park Slope, a very upmarket area indeed. He said what made him fall in love with books as a
*15:53.620- 15:58.360* :  boy was encountering the adventure tales of Robert Louis Stevenson. By the time he went to study at
*15:58.360- 16:03.840* :  Columbia in New York, it was the turbulent late 60s and Columbia then, and of course, as we've
*16:03.840- 16:08.940* :  been hearing today, was a focal point of tension in society at the end of the 60s, having had
*16:08.940- 16:13.480* :  enough of America for the time being he moved to Paris, where else to become a writer. In his case,
*16:13.480- 16:19.500* :  he had the talent and persistence to succeed big success came in 1985 back in America. The New
*16:19.500- 16:23.760* :  York trilogy was a playful detective story. I think you could say influenced by writers,
*16:24.220- 16:29.580* :  yes, such as Dashiel Hammett, but with a lot of philosophising in there too, it focuses on a writer
*16:29.580- 16:34.520* :  who becomes a private detective. There's a character in the novel called Paul Orster. He was asked
*16:34.520- 16:41.280* :  in a BBC interview by the Paul Orster, invented that Paul Orster. I've always been interested in the fact
*16:41.320- 16:49.620* :  that when you're reading a novel, who's speaking? You see worn piece by Leo Tolstoy.
*16:50.700- 16:56.140* :  And then you open up the book and a voice is talking to you. Who is it? Is it Leo Tolstoy?
*16:57.100- 17:04.260* :  Where is it some authorial voice that comes out of Leo Tolstoy? Well, it fascinated me to take
*17:04.260- 17:10.400* :  the name that's on the cover of a book, the supposed author and put it inside the book
*17:10.720- 17:16.440* :  and to see what happens. Ironically enough, the Paul Orster character, although he resembles me,
*17:17.480- 17:21.560* :  has opinions that are diametrically opposed to mine about everything. And I'm trying to make
*17:21.560- 17:26.240* :  fun of myself. And Vincent, it does seem he was more popular in Europe than in the US.
*17:27.000- 17:31.500* :  Well, I think that's true. Other books followed, such as in the country of last things and Leviathan,
*17:31.740- 17:36.780* :  all reviewed very widely in the US, even at the adoration you're right, was more absolute in
*17:36.780- 17:41.680* :  Europe, especially in France, where he lived, as we said, lots of big European awards. He's one
*17:41.680- 17:46.320* :  of those writers who established a reputation quite early on in his 30s. And though that was
*17:46.320- 17:52.140* :  definitely his heyday, he had many admirers right to the end. And don't forget that he directed
*17:52.140- 17:58.160* :  three films, including The Inner Life of Martin Frost in 2007. Quite a few writers fantasize,
*17:58.160- 18:04.440* :  frankly, about movie success. Paul Orster actually got there himself. Vincent Daoud on the work of
*18:04.440- 18:11.100* :  Paul Orster, who's died age 77. To Australia now, where one lucky teenager has landed the catch
*18:11.100- 18:16.640* :  of a lifetime, the 19-year-old from an Aboriginal family that was struggling to make ends meet
*18:16.640- 18:22.440* :  has won a life-changing amount of money. Thanks to a fishing trip, Jessica Wilkins reports.
*18:25.240- 18:31.360* :  Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Let a man go on a fishing trip, and he could win
*18:31.360- 18:37.540* :  a million bucks. An Australian teenager caught the ultimate prize last Sunday when he snagged a
*18:37.540- 18:43.160* :  rare fish. Keegan Payne was fishing in the Catherine River with his younger sister when he caught
*18:43.160- 18:49.460* :  a barramundi. The 19-year-old was going to take it home to eat when his eagle-eyed sibling spotted a
*18:49.460- 18:55.620* :  red tag on the fish. Measuring more than two feet in length, the tagged barramundi was also top
*18:55.620- 19:02.420* :  prize in a fishing competition and had evaded anglers for nine years. Now that Keegan has caught it,
*19:02.420- 19:10.600* :  he has also won one million Australian dollars. That's the equivalent of $648,000 US dollars.
*19:11.480- 19:17.420* :  He comes from a large Aboriginal family who have been living on a tight budget. In a press conference,
*19:17.420- 19:22.660* :  he said his winnings would be a big help for his family. It's pretty hard going for us at the
*19:22.660- 19:28.120* :  moment with money, but yeah, now with a million dollars, we don't have to complain about it.
*19:29.740- 19:34.200* :  Keegan said he was going to take his family on holiday and buy a new boat with the money.
*19:38.760- 19:43.800* :  That report by Jessica Wilkins. Still to come?
*19:43.960- 19:51.100* :  Bonima mobilised her followers into the Hargiela Army, an all-female team dedicated to
*19:51.100- 19:56.780* :  protecting the greater Agitant. Recognition for the women in India protecting a rare stalk.
*20:07.080- 20:13.200* :  The authorities in Georgia say 63 people were arrested and six officers were injured on Tuesday.
*20:13.800- 20:18.780* :  During protests against a new law being considered by Parliament that would affect charities,
*20:18.780- 20:24.400* :  media groups or campaigners that receive any foreign funding. Those protesting say it resembles
*20:24.400- 20:31.020* :  legislation used in Russia. They say that they push it, but they don't know that as Georgian
*20:31.020- 20:37.440* :  people would rather die than be the slaves of Russians, we will die for Georgia and we will never
*20:37.440- 20:43.100* :  be the slaves of Russians. Our correspondent Rayhanda Metri in the capital Tbilisi told us more
*20:43.100- 20:48.480* :  about the protestors. They believe that this legislation will curtail freedoms in the country.
*20:48.480- 20:54.240* :  Georgia has a vibrant civil society, non-governmental organisations and independent media,
*20:54.860- 21:01.360* :  and they do a really important work in monitoring the government policies, also monitoring elections
*21:01.360- 21:08.100* :  and many, many other programs. And most of these NGOs, they are funded by the EU or the United
*21:08.620- 21:15.520* :  States and therefore this legislation which is targeting civil society organisations and independent
*21:15.520- 21:20.980* :  media is seen by the protestors as an attack on Georgia's partners that are helping this country
*21:20.980- 21:26.100* :  to move forward with their democracy. And it's also seen as an attack on the country's democracy.
*21:26.100- 21:31.840* :  The reference to Russia there is because in Russia a similar legislation was adopted in 2012
*21:32.120- 21:37.740* :  and it was expanded over the years. Now we hear almost every week you know new kind of critics
*21:37.740- 21:43.220* :  of the government in Russia being designated as foreign agents and therefore Georgians think that
*21:43.220- 21:48.540* :  this law is unacceptable, that it will really change the situation in the country in terms of
*21:48.700- 21:53.380* :  democratic freedoms. And what sort of reaction, if any, has there been from the European Union?
*21:54.060- 22:00.420* :  We've heard kind of condemnations of course this morning Joseph Barrel, the EU foreign
*22:00.940- 22:07.040* :  policy chief, he urged the government kind of reminding Georgian authorities that this is a
*22:07.260- 22:13.920* :  candidate country to join the EU. Georgia received these status back in December 2023.
*22:14.060- 22:20.940* :  So Joseph Barrel called for a strain and so far like most of the reaction that we've heard from
*22:21.920- 22:27.100* :  different European capitals and European leaders of course has been first of all urging the
*22:27.100- 22:33.040* :  government not to adopt the law saying that it is inconsistent with European values and now
*22:33.700- 22:38.180* :  since this violence, outbreak of violence of course calling for a strain.
*22:39.000- 22:44.840* :  That was Rayhanda Metri in Georgia. To China next to a 24 people have died after a highway
*22:44.840- 22:51.380* :  collapsed in the province of Guangdong. The images are striking a stretch of highway with a gaping
*22:51.380- 22:58.340* :  hole, the smoking remains of wrecked vehicles sitting in red mud. Our China correspondent Steven
*22:58.340- 23:04.280* :  McDonald told us what happened. Given by the dangerous standards of China's roads, this has been a
*23:04.280- 23:12.060* :  terrible incident. A large section of highway has collapsed in the hills of Guangdong, close to
*23:12.060- 23:18.100* :  major city. Even though it was the early hours of the morning, 18 vehicles were trapped. Now many of
*23:18.100- 23:26.600* :  them have fallen into this huge muddy hole. Smoking flames have been captured on people's cameras
*23:26.600- 23:32.200* :  and shared on social media and given an idea of how difficult it's been, local officials are saying
*23:32.200- 23:38.840* :  they've sent 500 emergency workers to the site including firefighters and mining rescue teams.
*23:38.840- 23:44.700* :  Now I wonder why mining rescue teams and of course they're used to collapsed areas albeit underground.
*23:44.700- 23:50.740* :  It probably suits the sort of stuff they used to working with. They've managed to get dozens of
*23:50.740- 23:55.580* :  people out who've been rushed to hospital but although we don't know exactly what's caused this,
*23:55.960- 24:03.640* :  it does follow weeks of heavy driving rain in Guangdong which has caused landslides, it's caused
*24:03.640- 24:11.160* :  flooding. I mean, they even had a tornado struck Guangzhou last week killing five people and you know,
*24:11.160- 24:15.140* :  these areas they are used to heavy rain like right next to this section of highway that collapsed,
*24:15.140- 24:19.040* :  there does appear to be another area which has had work done on it to try and
*24:19.320- 24:24.100* :  shore it up to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen. Nevertheless, you would be expecting
*24:24.100- 24:28.840* :  to drive along the road and not have a huge hole appear in front of you and especially to have
*24:29.500- 24:36.540* :  18 cars fall into a giant hole. It's a terrible state of affairs and apart from that again,
*24:36.540- 24:43.200* :  the blame is going towards climate change because although Guangzhou is used to heavy rains,
*24:43.200- 24:48.220* :  as I say it happens all the time and even flooding in Guangdong province, the frequency and the
*24:48.220- 24:54.100* :  ferocity of these things is just getting worse and worse every year and so the cause is going
*24:54.100- 25:00.140* :  out to do something about climate change here. Stephen McDonald in China. New research suggests
*25:00.140- 25:05.680* :  footballers in the English women's super league are more likely to get injured at certain points in
*25:05.680- 25:11.000* :  their menstrual cycle. The study found players were six times more likely to pick up a muscle injury
*25:11.000- 25:16.380* :  in the days leading up to their period than during it. Here's our sports correspondent Katie Gornal.
*25:17.040- 25:21.900* :  Female footballers have long suspected a link between injury risk and their periods,
*25:21.900- 25:28.000* :  but little research exists in this area or in women's sport in general. Scientists, including
*25:28.000- 25:33.500* :  those from UCL and the University of Bath are trying to change that. They tracked players from
*25:33.500- 25:40.120* :  a top WSL club for three years in the first study of its kind. They found that there were six
*25:40.120- 25:45.660* :  times more likely to experience a muscle injury in the pre-menstrual phase compared to when they
*25:45.660- 25:51.300* :  were on their period. Further research is needed to explore why that might be. 26 players were
*25:51.300- 25:56.620* :  monitored but despite the relatively small sample size, the authors of the study say it should be
*25:56.620- 26:01.920* :  a call to action and reinforces the need to consider the menstrual cycle in elite sports
*26:01.920- 26:07.100* :  to reduce injury risk and to support the well-being of athletes. Katie Gornal.
*26:08.120- 26:13.220* :  One of the world's rarest stalks is being protected by a group of women living in the remote
*26:13.220- 26:18.940* :  Indian state of Assam and their work has just won a Whitley award described as the green
*26:18.940- 26:25.160* :  Oscars. The stalk is called the Greater Agitant and known locally as the Scavenger Bird or
*26:25.160- 26:31.320* :  Hargilla, meaning bone swallah in Assamese. The women are led by Purnima Davy Barman,
*26:31.320- 26:37.920* :  a wildlife biologist and conservationist. Here's Sir David Attenborough describing her success in
*26:37.920- 26:44.380* :  saving the stalk in a film for the Whitley Awards. Her persistent campaigning quickly attracted
*26:44.380- 26:52.240* :  support, particularly amongst the women of Assam. Purnima mobilised her followers into the Hargilla
*26:52.240- 27:00.640* :  Army, an all-female team dedicated to protecting the Greater Agitant. Together, Purnima and her army
*27:01.000- 27:05.300* :  are on a mission to break down barriers and challenge preconceptions.
*27:06.500- 27:09.500* :  And Purnima spoke to Martha Carney about the Hargilla.
*27:10.220- 27:17.360* :  Everything is unreal for me, Sir David Attenborough, when I talk to my like Purnima and Hargilla
*27:17.360- 27:24.280* :  Army, I think it's a huge empowerment. I come from a village from Assam and I think for all the
*27:24.280- 27:31.020* :  women from our village, it's a huge recognition and all the future generations, all the young girls,
*27:31.400- 27:37.720* :  I am in tears, all the young girls from our Assam and I think from India, it's like it's a huge
*27:37.720- 27:44.320* :  empowerment. I think many women will come forward and thanks a lot. Oh, it's wonderful to hear that.
*27:44.840- 27:51.080* :  And just tell us why this bird, this scavenger bird, is so important to you. I mean, they're huge,
*27:51.080- 27:57.400* :  aren't they? Five foot tall, eight foot wind spring span. Yeah, Hargilla is, I think, one of the most
*27:57.400- 28:04.140* :  beautiful bird in the world and they look about my size, like a human being. It's and they're so
*28:04.140- 28:10.260* :  magnificent with the wind span, with a huge wind span. I think they are the power to sort
*28:10.260- 28:17.360* :  of challenges and they give us the lessons of wisdom and they they are our cleaner birds,
*28:17.360- 28:23.800* :  they are scavengers and they are our cleaner birds. They they make our landscape disease-free
*28:23.800- 28:28.960* :  and that's what local people think is their recitation. Is it their really dirty birds, aren't they?
*28:29.540- 28:36.140* :  Because they are scavenger birds, they go to garbage dump and because of that, it was a very
*28:36.140- 28:42.520* :  big reputation for the Storks. People treated them often as a bad woman or a disease carrier or a
*28:42.520- 28:47.700* :  pest. But you're really changing their image and you're fully on message today because you've
*28:47.700- 28:55.560* :  got a beautiful, sorry, which has been woven with images of the store. Yeah, so that everything is
*28:55.560- 29:01.840* :  since now and I'm very thankful to Whitley Awards for all this honor and yeah, so as you ask,
*29:01.840- 29:09.180* :  you can see our hargilla motive into our asamish textiles. This is our asamish dress and we have
*29:09.180- 29:15.860* :  many other textiles where our women weave the hargilla. Yeah, they are very proud to celebrate
*29:15.860- 29:22.320* :  the beauty of the bird and this way it gives them economic opportunities and it creates many
*29:22.320- 29:28.160* :  opportunities for livelihoods, for many households in Assam. And finally, why did you decide to work
*29:28.160- 29:37.760* :  with women rather than men? When I started my work, all the time I often got complain from
*29:38.320- 29:45.200* :  people and from many men also that hargillize a bad woman, a disease carrier and it became a
*29:45.200- 29:51.820* :  challenge for me to bring the birds into tradition and culture and at that point I always realized
*29:51.820- 29:59.020* :  that our women have that power to bring hargilla into our asamish culture into our tradition.
*30:02.940- 30:08.820* :  Now they are a key part of any action movie and yet they are usually overlooked. The stunt men
*30:08.820- 30:15.240* :  and women who make sure that the stars look heroic but stay safe. Now two of Hollywood's biggest
*30:15.240- 30:21.160* :  names, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, are starring in one of this year's blockbusters, the full guy
*30:21.160- 30:27.480* :  based on the 1980s TV series of the same name and they've been speaking to our culture reporter
*30:27.480- 30:33.260* :  Charlotte Gallagher about this film, the Oscars and recognition for stunt men and women.
*30:36.160- 30:46.600* :  Emily Blunt is the film director and Ryan Gosling, the stunt man. The star of the film within
*30:46.600- 30:53.360* :  the film has fallen in with a bad crowd. You need to bring him back. Why me? You're a stunt man.
*30:53.440- 30:59.060* :  Nobody's going to notice you. That's your job, no offense. I mean, some taking. How much did you
*30:59.060- 31:02.200* :  have to do, stunt wise, Ryan? Like what's the scariest thing that you had to do in this film?
*31:02.380- 31:06.340* :  I mean they dropped me off of a building, 12 stories at the beginning of the film, which took
*31:06.340- 31:12.440* :  no skill at all in my end. I just got dropped but that was kind of scary. It's a mental hurdle
*31:12.440- 31:18.980* :  because I don't love, I don't love heights. We're going to surf this man on fire. We're a stunt
*31:18.980- 31:23.860* :  guy. We need to keep it. Super professional. Confession is my domain. They said your middle name was
*31:23.860- 31:30.140* :  dangerous. There's never been an Oscar to recognize the work of stunt men and women but both
*31:30.140- 31:35.020* :  actors want to change that. They dress like us. They do the dangerous things for us. They take
*31:35.020- 31:39.940* :  the hits. They put themselves in harm's way for us. They play our characters as well. I mean,
*31:39.940- 31:44.720* :  we're not the only ones that play our characters. They're actors to same union and yet they hide
*31:44.720- 31:49.920* :  their face and disappear into the shadows and everyone sort of pretends like they weren't there.
*31:49.920- 31:53.840* :  The better they are at their job, the more you they disappear in a way and it's just
*31:55.760- 32:00.120* :  it ends now. It ends with what's filming this? We're flipping the script. Oscar's first stunt man?
*32:00.240- 32:07.640* :  Yes, immediately now. Why not before? Pretty crazy. They risk more than anyone. Their work is
*32:07.920- 32:13.620* :  an art form. It's designed just as much as makeup or costumes or anything else so
*32:14.340- 32:19.020* :  when you understand what they're risking personally and physically it only deepens your
*32:19.020- 32:23.500* :  appreciation for what they do and what they contribute. They've trained for this. They have
