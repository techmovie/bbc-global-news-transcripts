*01:29.820- 01:30.740* :  As Ukrainian forces,
*01:31.080- 01:33.600* :  struggle to hold back Russian advances on several fronts

*01:52.060- 01:54.400* :  may mistakenly think they're not obese

*02:12.640- 02:13.780* :  I'm just very very honored.
*02:19.060- 02:22.060* :  As Ukrainian forces try to hold back Russian onslaughts
*02:22.060- 02:24.720* :  at several different points on their sprawling front line,
*02:24.720- 02:28.980* :  America's top diplomat has announced a further military aid package.
*02:29.600- 02:32.220* :  This comes as President Zelensky has cancelled
*02:32.220- 02:34.120* :  upcoming international trips,
*02:34.760- 02:37.500* :  including visits to allies Spain and Portugal,
*02:37.880- 02:41.080* :  reportedly because of the worsening situation on the battlefield.
*02:41.860- 02:45.740* :  A week after Russia's surprise attack on the Northeastern Harkiv region,
*02:45.740- 02:49.160* :  Ukraine has pulled back troops from some border regions,
*02:49.820- 02:53.540* :  but at the same time, it's insisting it will not allow the Russian occupiers
*02:53.540- 02:54.740* :  to gain a foothold.
*02:55.240- 02:58.160* :  U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, who's visiting Ukraine,
*02:58.160- 03:01.820* :  announced a $2 billion of military aid at a news conference
*03:01.820- 03:04.600* :  with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dimitro Kuleva.
*03:05.180- 03:07.960* :  Ukraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught,
*03:09.020- 03:13.820* :  and we see, again, senseless strikes at civilians' residential buildings.
*03:14.840- 03:15.740* :  We're rushing ammunition,
*03:16.360- 03:18.680* :  armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses.
*03:19.600- 03:22.480* :  We're rushing them to get to the front lines, to protect soldiers,
*03:23.100- 03:24.040* :  to protect civilians.
*03:24.900- 03:27.880* :  And on air defenses, as Dimitro said, this is, of course, a top priority.
*03:28.620- 03:32.660* :  And we focused in our own conversations in detail on the work that we're doing,
*03:33.340- 03:36.680* :  to find more air defenses and to get them to Ukraine.
*03:36.680- 03:41.000* :  And I can tell you that that, for us, is a matter both of urgency and priority.
*03:41.900- 03:47.440* :  This comes weeks after Washington finally approved a $61 billion military aid package
*03:47.440- 03:49.780* :  after months of wrangling in the U.S. Congress.
*03:50.420- 03:54.520* :  Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse watched Mr. Blinken's news conference in Kiev?
*03:55.100- 03:59.060* :  This feels like the substance to this two-day diplomatic visit.
*03:59.260- 04:01.260* :  You've firstly heard from Dimitro Kuleva.
*04:02.100- 04:07.540* :  Reiterate Ukraine's wish list, that air defense systems are top of the list.
*04:07.780- 04:13.560* :  He's previously asked for seven of the actual launch systems used to launch these missiles.
*04:13.640- 04:16.880* :  They cost about a billion dollars each, and thus far,
*04:17.400- 04:19.980* :  Western Allies have been reluctant to hand them over,
*04:20.480- 04:23.140* :  because of either cost or in the case of Greece.
*04:23.140- 04:24.600* :  They say they need them themselves.
*04:24.600- 04:30.940* :  And this has been an issue brought into sharp focus with this Russian assault in Northeastern Ukraine,
*04:30.940- 04:37.620* :  because of the city of Hardkiv now coming in under increasing aerial attack by invading forces.
*04:38.300- 04:41.060* :  So you had that reiteration from Dimitro Kuleva.
*04:41.740- 04:46.480* :  You had that two-billion package announced by Anthony Blinken to kind of grease the wheels
*04:46.480- 04:48.380* :  of this incoming American aid.
*04:48.820- 04:50.980* :  I think that's been his call message throughout, saying,
*04:50.980- 04:53.680* :  look, we're going to get this to you as quickly as possible,
*04:54.360- 05:00.460* :  while Ukrainian forces continue to withdraw its scenes in this Northeastern Hardkiv region.
*05:00.960- 05:06.200* :  And then was there perhaps a significant shift in policy or tone for Anthony Blinken,
*05:06.820- 05:13.940* :  where he was asked whether he would allow or relax the stipulation that Ukraine wasn't allowed
*05:13.940- 05:17.600* :  to use missiles provided by the West on targets inside Russia.
*05:18.280- 05:20.620* :  Until now, it's been agreed that won't happen,
*05:20.620- 05:26.600* :  reluctantly on key of side, because of Western fears of an escalation by Russia in this war.
*05:27.080- 05:29.080* :  Interestingly, there was to Blinken there said,
*05:29.380- 05:34.580* :  well, we've never encouraged that, but it's up for Ukraine to make those decisions.
*05:34.700- 05:40.760* :  Was he perhaps loosening those restrictions around the use of Western missiles in that way?
*05:40.820- 05:43.380* :  What is this attack in Hardkiv, then, is showing,
*05:44.000- 05:50.860* :  is Ukraine's struggle to defend this increasing front line, because the border area there is huge.
*05:51.640- 05:54.640* :  And Ukraine has struck, yes, hit targets inside Russia,
*05:54.680- 05:57.940* :  but only with drones and missiles it's manufactured domestically,
*05:58.680- 06:02.060* :  given that it's long been known that Russian troops have been gathering across the border.
*06:02.060- 06:04.820* :  There are question marks over whether Ukraine is even able
*06:04.820- 06:08.520* :  to prevent the incursion that is now five days in, six days in.
*06:09.240- 06:14.420* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev. As we record this podcast, we're getting reports from Slovakia that
*06:14.420- 06:19.720* :  the Prime Minister, Robert Fizzo, has been taken to hospital after being shot and wounded.
*06:20.460- 06:25.480* :  One local news site said Mr Fizzo was leaving a government meeting in the central town of Hanlova
*06:25.480- 06:30.080* :  when several shots were fired from a crowd. A witness said he fell to the ground,
*06:30.080- 06:36.180* :  and was then loaded into a vehicle and taken away. Our correspondent, Rob Cameron, has the latest.
*06:36.600- 06:44.200* :  So far, we believe that a total of four or five shots rang out as Robert Fizzo was emerging
*06:44.200- 06:49.640* :  from that government meeting in the central town of Hanlova. We believe two or three of those
*06:49.660- 06:55.260* :  shots hit him. And the latest information that we have is that he was injured in the abdomen
*06:55.260- 07:01.560* :  and possibly in the arm and the foot. Eyewitnesses, members of the crowd were there to greet him,
*07:01.620- 07:07.460* :  said, described seeing him falling to the ground and being lifted off the ground.
*07:08.300- 07:15.840* :  And he was said to have blood on him. But exactly how serious those injuries are, we don't know yet.
*07:16.000- 07:19.980* :  So the hospital spokeswoman in the local town of Hanlova said that he was conscious.
*07:20.520- 07:26.160* :  He was being taken to a higher grade hospital. We believe that his Bansgar Vistritza,
*07:26.160- 07:32.440* :  which is the nearest big city in Slovakia, and that he was receiving a receiving treatment
*07:32.440- 07:37.540* :  in an intensive care unit for those injuries. But that's the information that we have on his
*07:37.580- 07:42.420* :  condition so far. And we'll bring you more in that story in a later edition of this podcast.
*07:43.840- 07:47.980* :  In an earlier edition of this podcast, we brought you news of an ambush in a prison van in
*07:47.980- 07:52.660* :  France that has shocked the nation. Two prison officers were killed and three others seriously
*07:52.660- 07:58.140* :  wounded when a convicted prisoner with links to drugs gangs in the city of Marseille was freed.
*07:58.740- 08:03.980* :  Video footage showed a car plowing into the prison van and a gang of men wearing balaclavas
*08:03.980- 08:09.240* :  then firing automatic rifles at the trapped officers before escaping with the inmate.
*08:09.720- 08:14.740* :  Now prison officers are taking part in a nationwide protest, holding a minute silence and
*08:14.740- 08:19.900* :  blockading the gates of jails across the country. This man spoke for many as he took part in
*08:19.900- 08:26.740* :  a protest outside of prison in northwestern France. We could never have believed what happened
*08:26.740- 08:32.820* :  to us yesterday. I've been a prison officer for 35 years. I experienced something similar back
*08:32.820- 08:40.300* :  in 1992, but this time it's far worse because we didn't expect it. It was a commando unit who
*08:40.300- 08:46.160* :  attacked the staff. Looking at the videos is clear that no one could have intervened and retaliated.
*08:46.700- 08:52.500* :  It all happened so quickly. A huge manhunt is underway with hundreds of police officers searching
*08:52.500- 08:57.420* :  for the killers and the prisoner they freed. I got more from our correspondent Nick Beak outside the
*08:57.420- 09:03.080* :  jail, whether he escaped convict was being held in Evre in northwestern France. This is the place
*09:03.080- 09:09.740* :  where for the past month or so the prisoner, Mohammed Amra, had been held and authorities have
*09:09.740- 09:15.600* :  confirmed in the past few hours that actually earlier in the week he attempted to break out of
*09:15.600- 09:22.860* :  this particular prison. They say that he tried in some way to saw through the bars of his jail cell.
*09:23.360- 09:28.360* :  Now clearly that was unsuccessful, but what happened yesterday was successful from his point of view
*09:28.360- 09:34.940* :  and the point of view of the men who staged this brutal ambush in which two prison officers
*09:35.560- 09:41.120* :  were killed and that is why we've seen this grief today in many parts of France, people talking
*09:41.120- 09:47.360* :  about the safety at work that they say they're simply not getting. So there is this anger fused
*09:47.360- 09:52.400* :  with grief today. And prison officers are calling on the authorities to do more to protect them
*09:52.400- 09:57.820* :  because these five prison guards were armed, but their guns were no defense against this very
*09:57.820- 10:03.460* :  heavy weaponry used by the attackers. Yeah and I think at the heart of this what the prison
*10:03.460- 10:09.440* :  officers are saying is that they're asked to do too many journeys. So in their eyes they're making
*10:09.440- 10:15.660* :  unnecessary trips either from prison to the courthouse or back again when a lot of these hearings
*10:15.660- 10:21.140* :  they say could be done over video by video link up and they say they're being put in danger. Also
*10:21.140- 10:25.860* :  they talk about having a lack of weaponry to protect themselves and you're absolutely right.
*10:25.860- 10:30.900* :  The attackers yesterday had some really serious weapons which reflects once again the criminal
*10:30.900- 10:36.580* :  gangs in France can get hold of very very powerful guns but also that they're not that they're
*10:36.580- 10:41.660* :  prepared to use them not just on each other but police officers or certainly people representing
*10:41.660- 10:48.140* :  the state security guards or prison staff. So there is a great deal of concern about this all
*10:48.140- 10:55.280* :  the while this this man hunt continues. Nick Beak in France. Firefighters in Western Canada say more
*10:55.280- 11:01.600* :  than 100 fires are now out of control. The wildfires have scorched tens of thousands of acres and
*11:01.600- 11:06.920* :  are burning close to a number of large towns in Alberta and British Columbia. Thousands of
*11:06.920- 11:12.480* :  residents have been told to evacuate as high winds are causing flames to move quickly. Marina
*11:12.480- 11:17.420* :  Barnes left her home in Fort McMurray a city in Canada's major oil producing region as thick
*11:17.420- 11:23.060* :  smoke was filling the skies. She spoke to Victoria Uwon Kundo from a new evacuation site a hotel
*11:23.060- 11:28.580* :  that was already full when she got there. I haven't really processed got a chance to process
*11:28.580- 11:33.980* :  everything yet because we're still kind of in limbo on where to go. What were you able to take
*11:33.980- 11:40.180* :  with you from your home when you evacuated? Definitely the cats were first and foremost we did
*11:40.180- 11:46.620* :  have warning so the evacuation alert came out on May 10th so we've had a few days to be prepared
*11:47.240- 11:52.380* :  so I was able to bring all my important documents. I've got documents for the cats and the pets and
*11:52.420- 11:57.780* :  stuff and then of course we've got clothes some non-perishable food items just some other you know
*11:58.120- 12:02.180* :  gaming stuff some stuff that I thought I would want to take with me just in case some expensive
*12:02.180- 12:11.480* :  things. How challenging has it been to move from place to place? I mean we're in the first spot
*12:11.480- 12:16.940* :  the first spot now and we we have options we've got friends reaching out to us in the area we
*12:16.940- 12:22.900* :  have traveled about two and a half hours south of where we live so we're waiting I'm still waiting
*12:22.900- 12:28.340* :  for the phone call we had to register as an evacuee at this hotel we're at and then wait for a phone
*12:28.340- 12:33.860* :  call from them to find out what to do and we're still kind of waiting just to hear where we're
*12:33.860- 12:40.040* :  supposed to go. How many people are with you at the moment or you evacuated with? I evacuated with
*12:40.040- 12:45.040* :  one friend who lived around the corner for me so he came and picked me up and we bought a lizard,
*12:45.040- 12:50.580* :  a dog and two cats in the truck with us and then our belongings. When you were leaving what was
*12:50.580- 12:56.180* :  the conditions that you were seeing around you when you were evacuating from your home? The roads
*12:56.180- 13:02.920* :  were pretty much gridlocked once we got that evacuation order people were panicking the smoke clouds
*13:02.920- 13:07.540* :  the sky was orange the smoke clouds were crazy the roads were completely gridlocked there was
*13:07.540- 13:12.840* :  peace officers and police directing traffic right through the stoplights and then as you were
*13:12.840- 13:20.160* :  heading out of Fort McMurray there was at least 10 to 12 maybe 15 massive sprinklers just
*13:20.160- 13:26.300* :  dousing water all over the trees in the grass there were helicopters flying all over police
*13:26.820- 13:32.820* :  driving up the wrong side of the highway up the sides of the roads there was a lot of people that
*13:32.820- 13:36.820* :  we got out of Fort McMurray and a lot of people had pulled over to the side of the road and turned
*13:36.820- 13:42.600* :  around and you see just this big massive black cloud of smoke you see the orange in the sky it was
*13:42.620- 13:49.880* :  terrifying to look back and see Marina Barnes speaking to Victoria Uon Kondo let's turn now to
*13:57.180- 14:02.340* :  Singapore where Lawrence Wong has been sworn in as the new prime minister he becomes only the
*14:02.340- 14:08.480* :  fourth leader of the Asian financial hub in its 59 year history a correspondent in Singapore
*14:08.480- 14:12.120* :  Nick Marsh told us more about him and the challenges he faces.
*14:12.920- 14:19.900* :  Lawrence Wong is taking over from Lisi and Lung who was in charge for 20 years and like you said
*14:19.900- 14:26.580* :  he's only the fourth person to lead Singapore in its 59 year history so Singaporeans aren't
*14:26.580- 14:31.960* :  really used to this kind of transition of power I mean it's literally a once in a generation
*14:32.340- 14:37.100* :  event I was actually just watching the coverage it's a pretty grand affair it's about a thousand
*14:37.100- 14:42.800* :  people grand presidential palace military lots of speeches all that kind of thing so it's not
*14:42.800- 14:47.160* :  often a new prime minister comes around in terms of the challenges that Lawrence Wong is going to
*14:47.160- 14:52.860* :  face I mean the very fact that his surname isn't Lee like his predecessor or like his predecessors
*14:53.400- 14:58.120* :  father Lee Kuan Yu was the founding father of Singapore that's going to be difficult because you know
*14:58.120- 15:03.420* :  the public they don't really maybe they don't consider him as coming from the same political
*15:03.420- 15:08.880* :  royalty as the people who came before him a little less credit in the bank I think his main
*15:08.880- 15:13.400* :  challenge really in terms of a foreign policy aspect is to make sure Singapore's friends with
*15:13.400- 15:18.960* :  both the US and China and at home he's got a call in election by the end of next year which his
*15:18.960- 15:24.160* :  party will certainly win they always win they've won every election since 1965 but the question is
*15:24.440- 15:29.580* :  by how much and you know how much young Singaporeans are still maintaining faith with the people's
*15:29.580- 15:35.340* :  action party which is dominated Singapore for so long Nick Marsh now are you one of those who've
*15:35.360- 15:41.020* :  managed to avoid the dreaded middle-aged spread if so well done but you may want to listen closely
*15:41.020- 15:46.500* :  to the following story Italian scientists say millions of middle-aged adults who believe
*15:46.500- 15:52.280* :  they're a healthy weight may in fact be obese the scientists reached this conclusion after they
*15:52.280- 15:58.360* :  looked at people's body fat percentage instead of calculating their body mass index or BMI a measure
*15:58.360- 16:03.500* :  that's commonly used to determine if people are overweight Philippa Roxby as our health reporter
*16:03.500- 16:09.320* :  and told us more about the study BMI body mass index is the standard way of measuring how healthy
*16:09.320- 16:14.260* :  people are whether they're healthy weight or overweight or obese but it's quite it's quite a broad
*16:14.260- 16:18.820* :  brush thing and it doesn't pick up doesn't know the difference between fat and muscle and bone so if
*16:18.820- 16:23.820* :  you're a very muscle person like a bodybuilder you seem to be a beast when actually you might be
*16:23.820- 16:30.180* :  quite fit so these Italian researchers scanned thousands of people instead looking at how much
*16:30.180- 16:35.840* :  body fat was in somebody's body a percentage and they found out that they actually found a lot more
*16:35.840- 16:42.480* :  people were obese than the the standard method of finding out and and so they're warning that BMI
*16:42.480- 16:47.900* :  on its own you know isn't really a great method and we know that because previous studies have
*16:47.900- 16:51.740* :  also said it's it's it's quite broad brush it doesn't really work very well so they're saying
*16:51.780- 16:56.480* :  you know always think of other things you can you can do to find out people are obese and they're
*16:56.480- 17:00.260* :  saying that potentially there could be millions of people who think that they're not a beast who
*17:00.260- 17:05.240* :  actually are and why is it important to find out if you're a beast well obesity is a chronic
*17:05.240- 17:10.680* :  disease and it leads to all sorts of other health issues like conditions like type 2 diabetes and
*17:10.680- 17:16.480* :  it ups your risk of heart disease and stroke cardiovascular disease so it's a major major health
*17:16.480- 17:21.220* :  issue and we know that right around the world globally there's a huge increase in the number of
*17:21.220- 17:26.460* :  people who are obese particularly in western countries and in places like the USA it's well over
*17:26.460- 17:32.240* :  a third of people are obese so there are huge health issues connected with it so the the closer we
*17:32.240- 17:36.620* :  are to knowing exactly how many people really are obese then the better it is for it for actually
*17:36.620- 17:42.740* :  trying to help them so people listening to this if they're worried what what can they do well I
*17:42.740- 17:47.960* :  think it this is acknowledging that as we age and this is really about middle aged people onwards
*17:47.960- 17:53.520* :  our bodies do change and actually we do tend to get a pile up of body fat around the middle and our
*17:53.520- 17:58.900* :  muscle mass declines as well and so our bodies are changing and we have to maybe think about that
*17:58.900- 18:06.840* :  the old as we age and maintain exercise think about our diet a bit more closely and be aware
*18:06.840- 18:16.480* :  that our bodies are changing good advice that was philippa roxpy still to come on this podcast remember

*19:08.980- 19:13.620* :  the two countries were essentially enemies that is of course an allegation that has been
*19:13.620- 19:18.640* :  levelled everybody had a different definition of what the problem was let's remember the background
*19:18.640- 19:26.100* :  of all these the explanation is the podcast from the BBC world servers making sense of the big stories
*19:26.100- 19:32.680* :  we're finding out why what is the evidence let's analyze it search for the explanation wherever you
*19:32.680- 19:45.240* :  get your BBC podcasts welcome back to the global news podcast for years now there have been
*19:45.240- 19:51.900* :  questions about the safety of Boeing 737 max aircraft this comes after two fatal crashes one in
*19:51.900- 20:01.560* :  2018 in Indonesia and one in 2019 in Ethiopia those crashes killed a total of 346 people now the
*20:01.560- 20:07.620* :  US justice department says that Boeing could face criminal charges after it determines the playmaker
*20:07.620- 20:12.780* :  had not complied with the terms of an agreement to shield it from prosecution the families of
*20:12.780- 20:18.740* :  those who died have welcomed this development zipura courier lost her father in the Ethiopian air crash
*20:19.440- 20:24.480* :  for the first time it feels like we're being listened to and we're being heard I think when you
*20:24.480- 20:30.060* :  lose a loved one in the way that we have there's no form of prosecution or justice or anything like
*20:30.060- 20:34.940* :  that that could ever suffice in terms of soothing that but I think for us the plight has been
*20:34.940- 20:40.160* :  that for the public safety and it's been clear that the more Boeing get away with the more dangerous
*20:40.160- 20:46.060* :  they are for the flying public for us this is finally a moment what feels like has been a
*20:46.060- 20:52.400* :  muffled scream for so long is finally being heard obviously it's we're not at outcome stage but it
*20:52.400- 20:57.940* :  feels like a step in the right direction as well as a three-year deal to avoid criminal prosecution
*20:57.940- 21:05.140* :  Boeing also paid 2.5 billion dollars our business reporter Monica Miller told us more federal
*21:05.140- 21:11.340* :  investigators had filed a letter in a Texas court accusing Boeing of violating that 2021 deferred
*21:11.340- 21:16.080* :  prosecution deal and they were saying that the reason is they violated the terms of the settlement
*21:16.080- 21:22.360* :  by failing to make promise changes to detect and prevent violations of a federal anti-fraud
*21:22.360- 21:27.860* :  law now this comes in the wake of a separate investigation that involves a January in flight blowout
*21:27.860- 21:36.360* :  of a door plug of a new 737 max nine jet that had exposed safety as well as quality issues at Boeing
*21:36.840- 21:41.420* :  so right now it is up to the justice department as a side whether to file charges against the
*21:41.420- 21:46.700* :  airplane maker prosecutors will tell the court their decision no later by the 7th of July
*21:46.700- 21:52.060* :  and this decision has been welcomed by the families of those who died in those 2A crashes
*21:52.420- 21:58.220* :  it has I mean this has been a long painful battle and the justice department has met with them
*21:58.220- 22:04.640* :  a few times on this issue Boeing has been in in front of Congress answering questions as to what
*22:04.640- 22:10.860* :  had happened but you know what what it really goes back to is after those fatal crashes Boeing
*22:10.860- 22:15.000* :  had reached as you mentioned a 2.5 billion dollar settlement with the justice department in
*22:15.000- 22:21.600* :  January 2021 and that was to avoid prosecution over one single charge of fraud that was misleading
*22:21.600- 22:26.960* :  federal regulators who would approve the plane now the airplane maker blamed a deception onto
*22:26.960- 22:33.600* :  relatively low level employees now this deal was made but it didn't have the backing of these
*22:33.600- 22:39.920* :  family members who said that you know basically deny them any justice for the deaths of their loved ones
*22:40.660- 22:46.620* :  and what's Boeing's reaction been to this? Well Boeing has come you know has basically denied it
*22:46.620- 22:51.260* :  they say that they will work with the justice department but they believe that they had
*22:51.260- 22:56.140* :  honored the terms of their agreement and that they said that they look forward again to the
*22:56.140- 23:02.320* :  opportunity to respond to the department on this issue Monica Miller there's already been massive
*23:02.320- 23:07.900* :  civilian bloodshed in Sudan civil war which has been raging for more than a year now it appears
*23:07.900- 23:13.300* :  the region of Darfur is on the brink of another disaster two decades after the genocide

*23:31.660- 23:37.640* :  the conflict and there appears that if the RSF and its allied Arab militias do take the city they'll
*23:37.640- 23:44.760* :  carry out ethnically targeted killings and rates calcadena newbeltel reports Elfasha has been a
*23:44.760- 23:50.600* :  refuge for people fleeing violence in Sudan's Darfur region tens of thousands fled to the city when
*23:50.600- 23:55.700* :  their villages came under attack from members of the paramilitary rapid support forces or
*23:55.700- 24:02.220* :  RSF the group has besieged the city for weeks and on Friday fighting intensified the medical

*24:08.400- 24:15.100* :  two children residents spoke of the continuous attacks while we were in our house and the
*24:15.100- 24:21.580* :  situation outside was very turbulent we heard a loud boom just rising and people screaming we
*24:21.580- 24:28.020* :  went outside to find an injured man and another who seemed to have died fear was in our hearts we
*24:28.020- 24:34.100* :  left the area and we walked along distant on foot until we reached a safe area after too much
*24:34.100- 24:41.240* :  suffering Sudan's year-long war is beating the Sudanese army against the RSF as they battle for
*24:41.240- 24:46.380* :  control of the country the war has taken a heavy toll on civilians with thousands killed and

*24:53.460- 24:59.620* :  in recent weeks relief agencies have been warning of a potential RSF offensive against Elfasha
*24:59.940- 25:04.640* :  those who had been seeking refuge in the city are once again in the line of fire
*25:08.420- 25:14.100* :  because of the ongoing fighting between the ASF and the RSF our last moments at home were
*25:14.100- 25:20.840* :  filled with fear horror and chaos we had to flee very quickly to get away from the escalating
*25:20.840- 25:27.200* :  danger the gunfire kept going and was constant to the point that bullets were flying through the
*25:27.200- 25:34.240* :  house i feel like this war is joined impact on our souls before claiming us it's leaving us with
*25:34.240- 25:42.480* :  very deep and painful memories all the warring sites have been accused by the UN of cross-rights
*25:42.480- 25:48.600* :  violations the RSF additionally are accused of targeting known Arabs in Darfur something that they
*25:48.860- 25:55.780* :  was no insight for the violence the suffering of the Sudanese people continues that report by

*26:21.000- 26:27.020* :  and Renata Padilla to tell us about how their lives have changed starting with Renata on the moment
*26:27.020- 26:35.500* :  she realized she'd lost her home as soon as i got to portolegri i saw my house with loads of water
*26:35.500- 26:42.380* :  so everything i had i lost due to this flood for me it was really shocking because i've never seen
*26:42.380- 26:48.960* :  anything like that at the same time there are a lot of people being rescued you can see in their
*26:48.960- 26:55.520* :  eyes that they were really traumatized you can see helicopters everywhere you can see sounds of
*26:55.520- 27:01.640* :  people screaming because they lost everything like in just a minute of their lives until right now
*27:01.640- 27:09.680* :  i can't do much i just have to sit here where i am and wait for the water just to go down so i can
*27:09.680- 27:14.580* :  go to my apartment and see what's left for me as Renata was saying also you want to help people
*27:14.580- 27:19.240* :  you want to be there you're a label by it man and you're say hey i can do something but i also have
*27:19.920- 27:26.160* :  elderly mother and that was a decision that i had to take basically right if do i go out do i
*27:26.160- 27:30.720* :  keep going out i keep trying i don't just stay home and try to get them out of here and the
*27:30.720- 27:35.280* :  warning was issued first and then they they gave it the order to evacuate it's not a set to see
*27:35.280- 27:39.440* :  the army going in and evacuating people from hospitals and stuff like that so that started really
*27:39.440- 27:45.460* :  getting to be my sister and also living in this street nearby and she had to evacuate completely
*27:45.460- 27:50.660* :  because her apartment was in the first floor and the hatchable factory got her cats and she's not
*27:50.660- 27:55.480* :  coming back to portal later she decided that she's gonna move away it's very interesting to to
*27:55.480- 28:01.400* :  her to like the story of Renata and Carlos because my my story is completely different i live in
*28:01.400- 28:08.060* :  Rio de Janeiro but my entire family he lived here in Santa Maria because i was in a military i
*28:08.060- 28:15.720* :  decided to go to the front and and help the way i can and one day i started to do some rescue
*28:15.720- 28:21.060* :  because i worked in social impact in Rio de Janeiro i'm trying to create some connections
*28:21.060- 28:28.240* :  between the organizations here in the organizations there for example here for like almost five days
*28:28.240- 28:34.640* :  we don't have a drinkable water and for three days we don't have electricity we were definitely not
*28:35.020- 28:42.920* :  i see that the solidarity is everywhere the feeling that i got from all of this is that we'll
*28:42.920- 28:49.280* :  face it together i totally agree with him i have to say it's like we see a lot of solidarity with some
*28:49.280- 28:55.860* :  community kitchens who are giving like one thousand two thousand five thousand food per day
*28:56.280- 29:00.080* :  like to give to the people are in the shelter so that is something beautiful
*29:01.340- 29:06.860* :  Carlos Renata and Taso talking about how the floods in Brazil have affected them
*29:08.540- 29:13.460* :  google was one of the first tech giants of the internet age it's search engine is used by more
*29:13.460- 29:19.340* :  than two billion people but the emergence of artificial intelligence bots like chat gpt have
*29:19.340- 29:24.240* :  been viewed as a threat to google's dominance now it's announced that it's calling the biggest
*29:24.240- 29:31.240* :  changes to its search engine in 25 years so whenever's on your mind whatever you need to get done
*29:32.020- 29:38.600* :  just ask and google will do the googling for you google's head of search there saying google will
*29:38.600- 29:44.260* :  be doing our googling so what does that mean exactly and how will it work nick miles after our
*29:44.260- 29:50.260* :  technology editor Zoe Kleinman this is google coming out fighting it's been accused of being a
*29:50.260- 29:55.280* :  bit on the back foot in this ai race which is really surprising because on paper google's got everything
*29:55.280- 29:59.940* :  it's got loads of money it's got loads of expertise it's been doing this for ages it's well regarded
*30:00.340- 30:06.220* :  and yet so far it's ai products just haven't kept up with those big viral market leaders you know
*30:06.760- 30:12.960* :  notably chat gpt from a play i but what we've seen is google showing off the next generation of
*30:12.960- 30:18.560* :  its products and clearly these are google demonstrations so this is the company making its products look
*30:18.900- 30:23.880* :  as good as they can possibly look but they are a game changer and what they show us is that if
*30:23.880- 30:29.300* :  you're Siri or Alexa you should be worried because these this next generation is sort of gunning
*30:29.300- 30:35.620* :  for that digital assistant market and the difference is it can do so much more so we're seeing
*30:35.620- 30:43.060* :  ai go into all of google's products you know making Gmail search more efficient being able to
*30:43.060- 30:48.760* :  specifically search through your endless photographs to find a picture of your car with
*30:48.760- 30:53.400* :  its license plate you know it will be able to identify which car is your car from the collection
*30:53.400- 30:58.780* :  of photos that it has of you with various cars and and the thing that i loved particularly was
*30:58.780- 31:04.960* :  there was a demo of of it using a smartphone camera to explore an office and pick out various
*31:04.960- 31:09.620* :  things in this office and at the end of the demo the lady who was showing it said where are my
*31:09.620- 31:17.720* :  glasses remember where you saw my glasses yes i do your glasses were on the desk near a red apple
*31:20.400- 31:24.460* :  and it hadn't been asked that before i didn't have to then specifically go and look for the glasses
*31:24.460- 31:28.480* :  it was just able to do it now if like me you lose your glasses all the time this is this is a
*31:28.480- 31:33.760* :  game changer isn't it but you can sort of see how this tech is trying to become not only super
*31:33.760- 31:40.000* :  useful but super useful in everyday life hmm so are you climbing there now
*31:51.180- 31:57.640* :  signed sealed delivered American music legend stevy wonder has been granted Ghanaian citizenship
*31:58.300- 32:04.000* :  the star now 74 has long been admirer of the west african country our reporter Thomas

*33:01.140- 33:09.080* :  be a co-pilot on a flight from one end of Ghana to the other end and so it was amazing
*33:09.600- 33:15.000* :  are there any upcoming projects or initiatives that you plan to undertake in Ghana?
*33:15.640- 33:21.440* :  i have an idea that i like to speak on and the very near future that i'd like to do
*33:22.180- 33:29.980* :  obvious that i'm not going to tell you but i think it'll be really a wonderful thing i think
*33:29.980- 33:38.420* :  what i'd love to see happen is africa have an award show and where they can really
*33:39.520- 33:43.920* :  acknowledge the greatness of people that have done great things in the world
*33:45.040- 33:47.040* :  and that was the great stevey wonder
