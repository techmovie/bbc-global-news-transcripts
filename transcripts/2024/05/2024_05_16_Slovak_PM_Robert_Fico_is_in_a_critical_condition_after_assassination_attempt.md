*01:27.460- 01:32.560* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Thursday, the 16th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:33.000- 01:38.040* :  The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fizzo, is in a critical condition following an attempt on
*01:38.040- 01:43.680* :  his life. A 71-year-old suspect has been arrested. The Israeli Defence Minister has criticized
*01:43.680- 01:49.700* :  the failure to draw up a plan for the future of Gaza in a rare public sign of division in the war
*01:49.700- 01:55.600* :  cabinet. And the Dutch nationalist politician, Hiet Wilders, says he's reached a deal with three
*01:55.600- 02:00.740* :  other parties to form a coalition government six months after his surprise election victory.
*02:03.320- 02:08.960* :  Also, in this podcast, I'd never noticed photography until I got sober in 1990 and I went to
*02:08.960- 02:13.860* :  friend's shadow in the South of France and he was buying photographs and I went, oh, these
*02:13.860- 02:18.520* :  are so beautiful and I noticed the art form for the first time. The British singer Elton John
*02:18.520- 02:22.240* :  on a major new photography exhibition from his own collection.
*02:26.540- 02:32.200* :  And we begin in the town of Handliver in Slovakia, the scene of an assassination attempt on the
*02:32.200- 02:40.620* :  Prime Minister, Robert Fizzo, outside a community centre. A gunman opened fire as Mr Fizzo was
*02:40.620- 02:47.040* :  leaving a government meeting on Wednesday. Police have arrested a suspect. Slovak media say he
*02:47.040- 02:54.120* :  is a 71-year-old man. The interior minister, Matush Soutai Eshtok, spoke to reporters at the hospital
*02:54.120- 02:59.940* :  where Mr Fizzo is being treated. But if today, after a meeting of the government in Handliver
*02:59.940- 03:04.760* :  an attack was committed on the Prime Minister, the perpetrator,
*03:06.760- 03:13.320* :  shot five times and the Prime Minister is in critical condition. In the first place,
*03:13.320- 03:20.480* :  I would like to assure the public that we will make everything that is in our power to investigate
*03:20.480- 03:24.700* :  this heinous crime. We are doing this at the moment as we speak.
*03:25.440- 03:29.380* :  The Prime Minister is a populist leader who is close to President Putin of Russia.
*03:29.840- 03:34.960* :  He's seen as a divisive figure in a politically polarised country. Speaking through the same
*03:34.960- 03:41.260* :  translator, the Defence Minister, Robert Kalinak, said the attack was a political assault on Slovakia.
*03:42.000- 03:52.140* :  What happened today is a stigma which will haunt us for many years to come.
*03:55.500- 04:00.760* :  But that is something that none of us think about at the moment. All we are focusing on
*04:00.760- 04:10.860* :  is the condition of the Prime Minister, Robert Fizzo. And we hope that he is strong enough
*04:12.420- 04:16.520* :  to deal with this trauma.
*04:17.220- 04:22.020* :  Our central Europe correspondent is Rob Cameron and just before we recorded this podcast,
*04:22.020- 04:27.360* :  I asked him about Robert Fizzo's condition, including reports that the Prime Minister will survive.
*04:28.260- 04:34.940* :  He is no longer in a life-threatening situation and that's something that is now being reported
*04:34.940- 04:41.960* :  by the Slovak media as well. He's reported to be conscious. The operation they said was a success.
*04:41.960- 04:48.220* :  It was certainly a long operation, I think three to four hours, as doctors tried to stop the bleeding
*04:48.220- 04:53.820* :  in his abdomen that had been caused by one of three bullets, I think, that hit him
*04:54.140- 05:00.200* :  of the five that we believe were fired from the gun in the town of Handel of others.
*05:00.580- 05:03.520* :  And what do we know about the arrested suspect?
*05:04.620- 05:11.400* :  Well, we know quite a bit, or at least the Slovak media is reporting a lot about him. There are
*05:11.400- 05:19.760* :  limits to what we can say. We know he's 71. We know that he fired what was a legally held weapon.
*05:19.760- 05:26.300* :  The Slovak media are naming him in full, I won't do so. But now there is also a video which is
*05:26.300- 05:34.980* :  circulating on social media and the Slovak media as well, in which this man appears to admit
*05:34.980- 05:43.040* :  carrying out the attack and also he appears to confirm that it was politically motivated and
*05:43.040- 05:48.940* :  apparently related to one of Mr Fitsor's most recent policies, which is the abolishing of the
*05:48.940- 05:54.740* :  country's public broadcaster. But again, that can't be confirmed. We don't know when this video
*05:55.620- 06:03.560* :  was made or under what circumstances this man was speaking if even he is the suspect. But certainly
*06:03.580- 06:10.760* :  we are getting bit by bit more information about who this man was, who this man is and why he
*06:10.760- 06:15.640* :  carried out this attack. And tell us a bit more about Robert Fitsor and his politics.
*06:16.500- 06:20.780* :  Well, Robert Fitsor, he's a real political survivor, Jackie. You know, he's been at the forefront
*06:20.780- 06:28.740* :  of Slovak politics since 2008, I think. I mean, he's certainly dominated Slovak politics when he
*06:29.200- 06:35.260* :  won the election in September and formed a new administration with ultra nationalist partners
*06:35.260- 06:42.440* :  and also another social Democrat party in October. That was his fourth term in Prime Minister. And
*06:42.440- 06:47.900* :  again and again, you know, he's been hit by a political scandal. He's been forced to resign once
*06:48.020- 06:54.740* :  and he's always come back. He is a political phoenix in Slovakia who will rise from the ashes and
*06:54.740- 07:00.140* :  I think many will believe that he'll do so again. That was Rob Cameron. Well, Celia Hattens
*07:00.140- 07:05.780* :  spoke to Tomasz Taraba, Slovakia's deputy prime minister, and she began by asking him for his
*07:05.780- 07:11.320* :  reaction to news of the shooting. I was very shocked and I tried to contact people in his surrounding
*07:11.320- 07:16.220* :  that figure out how serious is his condition. What more can you tell us about the circumstances
*07:17.060- 07:23.080* :  around the shooting? What's led up to this? Today was a phenomenal session and after that, he went
*07:23.080- 07:28.440* :  to his car and there were several people standing by the office and he came close to the people
*07:28.440- 07:36.560* :  because he always tried to be close touch with people and there was one, all their men
*07:36.560- 07:43.700* :  who started to shoot at him. The shooting was done from very close, so he was heavily injured.
*07:43.700- 07:49.500* :  One bullet went through with the stone mug and the second one hit the joint. So this is the
*07:49.500- 07:54.280* :  situation immediately because it was transported through the hospital and through the operation.
*07:54.580- 08:00.280* :  You mentioned one man, but your government has just in the past little while said that this
*08:00.280- 08:06.760* :  shooting was politically motivated. What can you tell us about the political environment before
*08:06.760- 08:13.520* :  the shooting? Slovakia, we won two elections. The president should won and in October we had
*08:13.520- 08:19.180* :  parliamentary elections, so our government has pretty stable and strong support in the public.
*08:19.180- 08:25.320* :  After both overheated, let's say, the atmosphere in the political era and he's present in Slovakia.
*08:25.320- 08:30.960* :  We think that Slovak opposition very often uses false narratives also in the international
*08:30.960- 08:36.600* :  politics about our government. They speak about false narratives that we want to leave the
*08:36.600- 08:42.460* :  European Union, that we want to join the cooperation with Russia and I don't know what these are,
*08:42.900- 08:48.360* :  false narratives and of course people from the other side who lost the election sometimes
*08:48.360- 08:53.840* :  can they believe to these narratives, they can become a little bit upset.
*08:54.680- 09:00.860* :  You've been clear, sir, about blaming the opposition for the circumstances that have led up
*09:01.140- 09:07.140* :  to this. In fact, you said earlier today the entire hateful opposition has bloody fingers or
*09:07.340- 09:15.220* :  blood on its hands, but is it fair to blame just the opposition for this fracturist environment,
*09:15.220- 09:20.800* :  for this polarized situation that we have inside Slovakia? Look, some kind of polarization belongs
*09:20.800- 09:26.500* :  to the democracy. Polarization is not bad, but the bad is when someone is on a daily basis
*09:26.500- 09:32.320* :  figuring out the fake news about you and mainly about Mr. Fitzer. Mr. Fitzer was presented by
*09:32.320- 09:39.040* :  opposition leader like almost the monster. This is what doesn't belong to the democracy,
*09:39.040- 09:43.780* :  so this is really a problem then. I'm a young politician so I don't have this kind of history,
*09:43.780- 09:49.980* :  but Mr. Fitzer is the prime minister for the fourth time and he's the prime minister who helped
*09:50.740- 09:56.040* :  Slovakia to become a member of the European Union of the NATO, of the Shanghai and of the Eurozone,
*09:56.520- 10:02.780* :  so is the politician who fully supports integration of Slovakia to the Euro-Atlantic alliance and
*10:02.780- 10:10.820* :  now when you should be attacked from a fake story how he wants to disrupt his membership of Slovakia
*10:10.820- 10:18.600* :  in the Euro-Atlantic community, this is fake story. Tomashtar Raba, Slovakia's deputy prime minister.
*10:19.140- 10:23.200* :  Well, there's been widespread international condemnation of the attack on the Slovak prime minister.
*10:23.560- 10:28.740* :  President Biden called it an alarming act of horrific violence. The White House Press Secretary
*10:28.740- 10:34.340* :  is Karin Jean-Pierre. The president expressed his alarm and deep concern over the attack.
*10:34.900- 10:39.220* :  As the president said, he and Dr. Biden are praying for a swift recovery in our thoughts
*10:39.220- 10:46.740* :  are with his family and the people of Slovakia. We condemn this horrific act of violence in our
*10:46.740- 10:52.720* :  embassies and close touch with the government and ready to assist. The European Commission President
*10:52.720- 10:58.360* :  Ursula Fonda Lyon warned that democracy was being undermined while Ukraine's President
*10:58.360- 11:05.220* :  Volodymyr Zelensky said such attacks must not become the norm. President Putin described Mr. Fizo
*11:05.220- 11:11.320* :  as a courageous and strong-minded man. To other news now, the far right Dutch leader
*11:11.320- 11:17.160* :  here at Wilders says he has reached agreement on forming a government. His nationalist party is
*11:17.160- 11:22.120* :  expected to form a coalition with the outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutgers centre-right party
*11:22.120- 11:27.760* :  and you've centrist party and the farmer's protest party. Mr. Wilders said he hopes the deal
*11:27.760- 11:34.880* :  would be approved soon. We have an agreement between the negotiators, so that is very good news.
*11:34.880- 11:40.080* :  But of course, there will only be a definitive agreement once the parliamentary groups also agree.
*11:40.440- 11:44.560* :  So we are now going to present this to our parliamentary groups in the hope that today will
*11:44.560- 11:49.940* :  reach a final agreement. The government once formed will be the most right-wing political
*11:49.940- 11:54.620* :  alliance to take power in the Netherlands in recent history. Here's Anna Holligan in the Hague.
*11:55.280- 11:59.780* :  Here to Wilders has influenced Dutch immigration policy from the opposition benches for almost
*11:59.780- 12:06.280* :  two decades. His shock election success in November meant a man once considered a pariah in
*12:06.280- 12:12.600* :  Dutch politics had the chance to form the new government. The 60-year-old toned down his anti-EU
*12:12.600- 12:18.640* :  anti-Islam rhetoric and forfeited his own Prime Ministerial ambitions in order to convince
*12:18.640- 12:24.440* :  the other parties to form a right-wing coalition. They and the rest of the country are now waiting
*12:24.440- 12:29.360* :  to hear who the peroxide blonde politician proposes as a Prime Minister candidate.
*12:29.880- 12:35.460* :  Anna Holligan. Fault lines have emerged in the Israeli war cabinet with the Defence Minister
*12:35.460- 12:41.840* :  Yuaav Galant criticizing the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his post-war plans or lack of
*12:41.840- 12:47.360* :  them for the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent Paul Adams is in Jerusalem. This is the Defence Minister
*12:47.360- 12:54.000* :  Yuaav Galant sounding extremely frustrated at what he says is the government's failure to address
*12:54.000- 13:01.360* :  the question of who governs Gaza when the war is over. He says that he has raised proposals
*13:01.360- 13:06.420* :  ever since the war began last October and that they have simply never been discussed
*13:06.460- 13:13.500* :  and that no alternative has ever been raised and he says that this indecision means that one of
*13:13.500- 13:20.460* :  two extremely bad options lies ahead either that Hamas rules Gaza in the future or that Israel
*13:20.460- 13:26.680* :  becomes responsible for military and civilian rule in Gaza for the indefinite future and he is
*13:26.680- 13:34.240* :  urging the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make an express commitment that Israel is not going
*13:34.240- 13:42.060* :  to be in charge of Gaza when the war is over. So this is a really public rebuke to the Prime Minister
*13:42.740- 13:50.060* :  following a period in which the disquiet of military leaders about the lack of a plan for the day
*13:50.060- 13:57.020* :  after has started to bubble up in press reports. And has there been any serious support for any
*13:57.020- 14:02.500* :  particular plan for governing the Gaza Strip after the operation? No and I think that is the point
*14:02.500- 14:09.780* :  that Mr. Galant is making that Israel can simply cannot continue avoiding such a fundamental question
*14:09.780- 14:17.260* :  and so this is Mr. Galant really laying down a gauntlet to the Prime Minister to come clean about
*14:17.260- 14:22.020* :  this question of the day after he says we simply cannot continue putting that off.
*14:22.200- 14:25.620* :  And though it was Israel's memorial day over the weekend and a handful of government ministers
*14:25.620- 14:31.660* :  including Mr. Netanyahu were actually heckled is this government going to be intact for long enough
*14:31.660- 14:37.620* :  to form a plan to govern Gaza? Well that depends on many things it depends on the course of the war
*14:37.620- 14:42.820* :  it depends on whether or not efforts to get Israeli hostages released are successful and it depends
*14:42.820- 14:50.140* :  on the support that the Prime Minister relies on from hard line right wing members of his government
*14:50.280- 14:57.040* :  and the his critics argue that it is those hardliners who are driving Israeli policy.
*14:57.320- 15:02.820* :  These are people who would like to see Israel stay in control of Gaza perhaps even return Jewish
*15:02.820- 15:10.320* :  settlers to live in Gaza when the war is over. Interestingly Mr. Netanyahu himself on social media
*15:10.320- 15:17.640* :  this evening seems to have replied to Mr. Galant saying that he is not prepared to swap Hamas stand
*15:17.640- 15:23.580* :  for what he calls Fatah stand. In other words he is not prepared to allow the Palestinian Authority
*15:23.580- 15:29.040* :  which controls the West Bank and is still dominated by the Palestinian faction Fatah to be the
*15:29.040- 15:34.860* :  power that rules in Gaza when the war is over. That was Paul Adams. In a separate development US
*15:34.860- 15:40.180* :  officials say that a floating pier designed to increase the amount of desperately needed aid
*15:40.180- 15:45.940* :  reaching Gaza will be operational within days. Hundreds of tons of food and other goods will be
*15:45.940- 15:52.180* :  shipped to the pier which is anchored several kilometers off the coast. Smaller US military vessels
*15:52.180- 15:58.720* :  will then transport it to a long floating causeway fixed to the shore. UN World Food Program
*15:58.720- 16:03.860* :  Trucks will then distribute it. While welcoming the development some UN officials have said
*16:03.860- 16:09.140* :  what's really needed is the reopening of all fully functioning land crossings into Gaza.
*16:10.680- 16:15.500* :  President Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump have agreed to their first televised
*16:15.500- 16:21.860* :  debate of this US presidential campaign. The first will be hosted by the American Broadcaster CNN
*16:21.980- 16:29.440* :  on the 27th of June. Unconventionally the two candidates appeared to arrange the debate themselves via
*16:29.440- 16:35.320* :  social media. Here's our North America correspondent Nomiya Ikbar. In a short video address
*16:35.320- 16:41.080* :  President Biden threw down the gauntlet. Donald Trump lost two debates to be in 2020. Since then
*16:41.080- 16:45.760* :  he hadn't shown up for debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well make my day
*16:45.760- 16:51.180* :  pal I'll even do it twice. He went on to say both of them should pick dates and then
*16:51.340- 16:57.680* :  stuck the boot in. That's a reference to Donald Trump's trial in New York where the court
*16:57.680- 17:03.100* :  doesn't sit on Wednesdays. The former president responded minutes later on his social network site
*17:03.100- 17:08.160* :  calling Mr. Biden the worst debater and proposing June and September for the one-on-one.
*17:08.160- 17:13.120* :  With the latest poll suggesting Mr. Trump leads in five of six crucial swing states
*17:13.120- 17:19.200* :  he has goaded President Biden saying he would debate him anytime any place. The actual party
*17:19.800- 17:23.820* :  conventions aren't until July and August when both men will be confirmed as the official
*17:23.820- 17:29.180* :  candidates for the presidential election. Last month 12 U.S. news organizations issued
*17:29.180- 17:34.740* :  please to the campaigns to agree to a traditional TV debate schedule. Nomiya Ikbar.
*17:35.960- 17:42.360* :  Images that capture moments in time. Marilyn Monroe, Malcolm X of Asachi Dress,
*17:42.360- 17:48.020* :  they are all photos owned by the British singer Elton John and his husband David Furnish.
*17:48.360- 17:53.540* :  The collection includes a picture of Sir Elton with egg on his face as well. The couple
*17:53.540- 17:58.920* :  have one of the greatest private collections of photographs in the world with more than 7,000
*17:58.920- 18:04.580* :  images and an exhibition of some of them will open at London's Victoria and Albert Museum this weekend.
*18:04.780- 18:10.760* :  In an exclusive interview with our culture editor Katie Razzle just after their first view
*18:11.080- 18:14.540* :  they talk about their love of the image. First Sir Elton.
*18:19.240- 18:24.660* :  We've collected these photographs over many years and some of them I forgot that we had because
*18:24.660- 18:29.220* :  we buy photographs and you don't see them that goes straight to the story. I met Sir Elton John
*18:29.220- 18:34.840* :  and his husband David Furnish in this arresting exhibition of their photographs from the 1950s
*18:35.260- 18:41.700* :  group to cross eight themes including designer, fashion and reportage. I couldn't be happier I'm
*18:41.700- 18:46.880* :  just astonished by what we've collected. It just hits so many emotional moments for both of us.
*18:46.880- 18:53.380* :  The Nangold in especially that one room which I bought on site. Nangold in's thanksgiving is a
*18:53.380- 19:00.440* :  gritty series of photographs documenting friends and lovers. I bought that because I thought there's
*19:00.440- 19:07.120* :  my life on the wall the addictions and the people we lost to aid. And there are 300 or so photographs
*19:07.120- 19:13.640* :  here out of probably 7,000 more than 7,000 that you have. Why are you so passionate about the image?
*19:13.660- 19:19.500* :  I'd never noticed photography until I got sober in 1990 and I went to a friend's shadow in the
*19:19.500- 19:25.040* :  south of France and he was buying photographs and I went oh these are so beautiful and I noticed
*19:25.040- 19:29.680* :  the art form for the first time. And the night we met the thing that we bonded over was photography
*19:30.260- 19:34.380* :  and so we sat with photographic books on our laps going through them and talking about the images
*19:34.380- 19:39.320* :  that we loved so much. I had owned the books Elton had actually some of the photographs so.
*19:44.060- 19:48.820* :  We are sitting surrounded by some very beautiful people in these stars of station screen but of
*19:48.820- 19:53.720* :  course there's sadness here as well we've got Marilyn, Mamro we've got Chuck Baker. I'm looking at
*19:53.720- 19:58.000* :  Miss Piggy as I think. Okay well she made me, she made me, she made me, she made me, isn't it?
*19:58.000- 19:58.980* :  Something for everyone.
*20:05.320- 20:12.200* :  Marilyn, Mamro, Chuck Baker they're clearly suffered for their art. Do you think you suffered for your art?
*20:12.680- 20:17.820* :  Well I did in a way I mean it was but it was self-inflicted because of addiction and alcoholism
*20:18.320- 20:23.000* :  and unhappiness but it's music saving it and it always has done but there are photographs with
*20:23.000- 20:27.960* :  great jazz artists who also suffered for their art and were paid nothing but inspired all of us
*20:28.640- 20:32.760* :  and it's just wonderful to see the pictures of Chet over there and I was looking straight over there
*20:33.460- 20:37.080* :  and you can see the visible pain he was in it every single one of those through photographs.
*20:43.320- 20:48.180* :  Let me tell you there's a lot of pain and grief on these walls, riots, political rights,
*20:48.180- 20:55.380* :  assassinations, civil rights, 1911. The image of the man falling from the World Trade Center.
*20:55.900- 21:01.200* :  Falling man by Richard Drew is a distressing image taken after the planes had hit the twin towers.
*21:01.560- 21:04.320* :  It's one of the most beautiful images we've ever seen and yet it's one of the most tragic.
*21:04.940- 21:09.720* :  What makes you want to collect that? Because in pain sometimes you have and sometimes in tragic
*21:10.300- 21:14.880* :  images whether it's paintings or photographs there was a lot of beauty unfortunately and that's
*21:14.880- 21:19.360* :  why the show is called Fraddle Beauty. This is the first time we've ever shown our 1911 photographs.
*21:19.360- 21:25.180* :  I have 2,911 photographs and every time we get them out I really think it's going to be okay
*21:25.180- 21:29.520* :  to show them it's still too raw for people who live through that but it's good to see some of them
*21:29.520- 21:33.560* :  there's only about four of them out and there's a very powerful photo of the January the 6th
*21:33.560- 21:38.440* :  Capitol Hill riots. Yes and we have more of those where that came from. Why did you want those
*21:38.440- 21:43.000* :  particularly? Listen storm in the Capitol it's historic it's important to have photographs like
*21:43.000- 21:55.340* :  that a record of what happened. I notice there aren't any photographs here of you performing but when
*21:55.340- 21:58.960* :  you look at photographs of yourself performing do you miss them? I hate photographs of myself. I hate
*21:58.960- 22:05.180* :  being photographed. I love being photographed. I find it really painful and so it's extraordinary
*22:05.180- 22:09.700* :  that I collect photographs. There are a couple of photographs that I like from the past where I'm doing
*22:10.020- 22:14.600* :  handstands on the piano my legs are like vertical in the air it's incredible but I would never put
*22:14.600- 22:23.660* :  myself up on the wall. No thank you. Elton John and his husband David Furnish talking to our
*22:23.660- 22:29.400* :  culture editor Katie Razzle and you can see some of the pictures on the BBC website and also on
*22:29.400- 22:40.520* :  the Victoria and Albert Museum online pages. Still to come. Thanks for waiting. One of our

*24:06.320- 24:13.080* :  This is the global news podcast. The UN has warned fundamental laws of war and human rights are
*24:13.080- 24:19.060* :  being violated every day in the Sudanese region of Darfur as clashes continue for control of the
*24:19.060- 24:25.780* :  city of Elfasha. A senior UN official says the Sudanese armed forces and the rapid support forces
*24:25.780- 24:32.380* :  are ignoring appeals for de-escalation and more measures to protect civilians. The warnings come
*24:32.380- 24:39.160* :  as famine threatens Sudan. Carl Skow is deputy executive director for the world food program.
*24:39.600- 24:46.120* :  Well this is now the worst food security situation in the world. We are estimating that some 20
*24:46.120- 24:52.500* :  million people are acutely food insecure. Some 5 million of those are in the starving condition.
*24:52.600- 24:57.400* :  The window of opportunity to prevent a disaster is closing.
*24:57.800- 25:04.820* :  Our Africa correspondent is Barbara Plattasha. It is the last major urban center in the western
*25:04.840- 25:12.340* :  Darfur region that the army still controls. It has become a sort of hub of humanitarian activity.
*25:13.140- 25:18.380* :  So it has tens of thousand perhaps hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Therefore it has
*25:18.380- 25:26.280* :  become a sort of last bastion if you would in that particular region and we've had a lot of
*25:26.580- 25:32.220* :  warnings from UN officials and others that if there is going to be major fighting in the city
*25:32.960- 25:39.160* :  then not only will we see an existing humanitarian crisis get out of control basically
*25:39.840- 25:46.100* :  but also many civilians will die. And you've told us about the thousands of civilians who have fled
*25:46.100- 25:53.400* :  to the city. Where else can they go? What options are left for those people?
*25:54.100- 26:00.720* :  Well that's a very good question because the answer is not much more can be done. First of all
*26:01.400- 26:07.480* :  the city has been surrounded by the RSF since mid-April so it's very difficult to get out of it
*26:08.080- 26:16.060* :  but even still they have come to Elfasha as a major hub from other villages and areas which have
*26:16.060- 26:21.580* :  been attacked or which have been affected by the fighting. So it is a reason why the UN and other
*26:21.580- 26:26.920* :  humanitarian agencies including doctors without borders have been saying that if the siege of the
*26:26.920- 26:34.780* :  city transpires into a major battle then it's the civilians who will pay the price. And there's a
*26:34.780- 26:41.300* :  factor here which is that some Sudanese rebel groups have thrown in their support for the
*26:42.280- 26:49.980* :  the Sudanese army in the city which means that it could be quite a fierce battle and there are
*26:49.980- 26:56.280* :  real concerns that the casualty figures could be very very high. Does this look like we are potentially
*26:56.300- 27:04.100* :  coming into the end stage of this conflict then if this is such a key locale or such a key battle
*27:04.100- 27:09.080* :  for this particular city? I don't think we're becoming into an end stage of the conflict overall
*27:09.380- 27:13.700* :  in terms of the Sudanese war that's been going on for more than a year now because there are other
*27:14.640- 27:19.900* :  major conflict points the fighting continues in the capital, Cartoum and surrounding cities
*27:20.420- 27:25.020* :  the further east in the country, Jazeera State where there have been clashes between the Sudanese
*27:25.020- 27:32.900* :  army and the RSF but the western Darfur region which is where the rapid support forces has its
*27:33.020- 27:40.020* :  base. I think there you would see a change in dynamic, a change in balance, a power control
*27:40.800- 27:46.560* :  if this city was taken because it is the last city in this area that the army holds. If that were
*27:46.560- 27:52.720* :  to happen there are all sorts of questions analysts have been warning that the country might be
*27:52.720- 27:59.480* :  divided into I don't think it would be quite as neat as that but it certainly is a significant
*27:59.480- 28:06.220* :  battle for a particular region of the country. Barbara Pletasha. The World Health Organization says
*28:06.220- 28:11.860* :  the situation in northern Afghanistan remains critical five days after hundreds of people were
*28:11.860- 28:16.960* :  killed by flash flooding. The authorities say more heavy rain is expected in the coming days.
*28:17.560- 28:23.220* :  Our correspondent Caroline Davis has visited some of the remote areas worst affected by the flooding.
*28:24.120- 28:30.280* :  Tree roots twisted cars and rubble a stick out of the mud in what was a village just a few days ago.
*28:30.280- 28:35.720* :  The mud has started to harden making it difficult to salvage anything as one man told us.
*28:37.260- 28:41.320* :  We haven't caught even a glass left for a cup of tea. There is nothing.
*28:43.040- 28:49.160* :  One wall is all that remains of Abdul Khalik's home. 10 members of his family died after they
*28:49.160- 28:57.240* :  were swept away by the water. We were searching for family members in need deep mud so we took off
*28:57.240- 29:04.020* :  our shoes and continued searching. Eventually we found the bodies miles away from here.
*29:04.640- 29:09.340* :  There's been flooding in the valleys in this area before but no one we spoke to had seen anything
*29:09.340- 29:15.420* :  like this in their lifetime. The UN has called the floods a stark reminder of Afghanistan's vulnerability
*29:15.420- 29:22.320* :  to climate change. On the battered road we saw a dozen women walking between villages paying their
*29:22.320- 29:29.380* :  respect and offering prayers to each home that had lost loved ones. They told us they'll have more
*29:29.380- 29:36.140* :  than one stop today. Caroline Davis. French troops have been deployed to secure ports and air
*29:36.140- 29:42.360* :  ports in New Caledonia as unrest continues in the French overseas territory. Earlier France declared
*29:42.360- 29:47.980* :  a state of emergency there following several days of unrest over plans to change voting rights.
*29:47.980- 29:53.900* :  Mickey Bristo reports. The French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that continued violence will
*29:53.900- 29:58.660* :  be met with a strict response. He's called for a resumption of talks to end the unrest.
*29:59.380- 30:05.180* :  Cars have been burnt and shops looted in two days of violence despite the imposition of a curfew
*30:05.180- 30:11.700* :  in the capital. The unrest which has claimed several lives was sparked by a decision in Paris to give
*30:11.700- 30:17.100* :  the vote to French residents who've lived in New Caledonia for ten years. Some indigenous
*30:17.100- 30:24.080* :  can act people believe this will dilute the power of their vote. Mickey Bristo. With two weeks to go
*30:24.080- 30:30.120* :  until South Africa's elections, President Cyril Ramaposa has signed into law a controversial bill
*30:30.680- 30:36.360* :  that aims to provide universal health care. He described it as a major step towards a more
*30:36.360- 30:42.440* :  just society. This man, called Tabo, sent a voice message to the BBC saying that he's worried
*30:42.440- 30:48.860* :  about the cost. I think the intent behind the bill is quite noble, but the main issue that I have
*30:48.860- 30:55.520* :  is the question around funding. The poor performance of the economy was unemployment in history,
*30:55.520- 31:02.880* :  the dwindling text base, all these issues. They just compound the problem and the question of
*31:02.880- 31:09.140* :  where is the money to fund the scheme. With more details, here's Shinganyaka.
*31:09.540- 31:15.020* :  The National Health Insurance Scheme will create a state fund to cover medical costs for all South
*31:15.020- 31:20.580* :  Africans, rich and poor. It goes further to bar people from taking out private health insurance
*31:20.580- 31:26.280* :  for treatment paid for by the fund. While the UN, unions and many voters welcome the scheme,
*31:26.280- 31:31.920* :  some opposition parties and business groups have threatened legal action. They say the scheme
*31:31.920- 31:37.200* :  violates the rights to choose a medical insurance provider and are also concerned about how it will
*31:37.200- 31:44.560* :  be financed in a country with high unemployment and a poor economy. Shinganyaka, your call is important
*31:44.560- 31:50.760* :  to us. How many times have you been told that as time grinds on while you wait on the telephone
*31:50.760- 31:56.700* :  for an actual human person to speak to you and mind numbing music plays in the background?
*31:57.380- 32:03.020* :  Opus number one is a track that is widely used and even considered the default hold music
*32:03.020- 32:10.000* :  on 65 million Cisco phone sets worldwide. Here's another one used by the UK Tax Office.
*32:18.220- 32:21.820* :  Thanks for waiting. One of our advisors will be with you as soon as possible.
*32:24.540- 32:29.000* :  Believe it or not there is an art to writing hold music as it's known. One of its best
*32:29.000- 32:33.020* :  known practitioners is Debbie Wiseman and she's been speaking to the BBC.
*32:38.020- 32:43.700* :  I think the problem is that it's repetitive often it's very loud and has absolutely nothing to do
*32:43.700- 32:49.480* :  with the brand and often when I think about hold music this always pops into my head. I'm just
*32:57.800- 33:01.320* :  by the piano now and it's usually edited really strangely and it loops so it doesn't make any
*33:01.320- 33:07.400* :  musical sense and it's tinny. Now the music should never be longer than the average wait time so
*33:07.400- 33:12.560* :  it doesn't have to endlessly repeat and it should reflect the brand. What do they want to convey
*33:12.560- 33:16.980* :  to their customers? I mean I heard that I think it was Pete's heart introduced music with
*33:16.980- 33:22.100* :  passionate singing about chicken wings and people would call the company asking to be placed
*33:22.100- 33:27.660* :  on hold just so that they could hear the song again and instead of hearing you know a representative
*33:27.660- 33:32.420* :  will be with you shortly or all of our team are busy at helping other customers. If they can hear
*33:32.420- 33:39.100* :  something that does actually reflect the brand and draw them in then two minutes won't feel so long
*33:39.500- 33:46.200* :  with horrible loud intrusive music two minutes on hold can feel like 20 minutes and then by the
*33:46.200- 33:51.540* :  time you do get through to an advice you're so enraged that you take it out on the poor person
*33:51.540- 33:56.480* :  that's trying to help you at the other end of the phone another one that's used a lot that and
*33:56.480- 34:01.220* :  it's not necessarily that it's bad music but you know the four seasons spring the valedict four
*34:01.220- 34:02.980* :  seasons used for the hold music
*34:10.020- 34:20.200* :  and then they go round and round again I wrote the music for Viking Viking Cruise's signature music
*34:20.200- 34:26.540* :  and it was called the Traveler and it was in order to sort of sum up what it's like to go on a
*34:26.540- 34:30.360* :  wonderful cruise and it had a feeling of journey about it and it's lyrical and melodic
*34:34.460- 34:39.600* :  and they use it now on their hold music not that they ever keep their customers waiting for
*34:39.600- 34:45.460* :  particularly long but when you get on hold on Viking you hear this music now it's their brand
*34:45.460- 34:51.360* :  music it says signature music and they're using it hopefully it makes it an enjoyable experience
*34:51.440- 34:56.340* :  and it puts the caller at ease I'm going to play you just a little bit of it now and see see if
*35:04.920- 35:05.020* :  it does that for you
*35:06.580- 35:09.380* :  Debbie Wiseman and the Art of Hold Music
