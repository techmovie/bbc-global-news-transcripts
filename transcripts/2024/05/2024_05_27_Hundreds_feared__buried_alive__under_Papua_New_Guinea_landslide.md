*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:56.120- 02:01.500* :  Officials in Nigeria say gunmen have abducted about 160 people from a remote village.
*02:04.600- 02:05.440* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:08.360- 02:10.200* :  They're loyal, affectionate and intelligent.
*02:10.460- 02:13.740* :  And believe me, if you show them affection, they'll show it you back.
*02:14.360- 02:19.600* :  Rehabilitating the humble pigeon, which has apparently been unfairly maligned in recent years.
*02:24.000- 02:31.940* :  The United Nations is now saying a huge landslide in Papua New Guinea may have claimed the lives of 670 people.
*02:31.940- 02:40.820* :  A once bustling village was almost completely obliterated when the landslide struck in the early hours of Friday morning, bearing scores of homes.
*02:40.820- 02:43.720* :  The side of a mountain appears to have sheared away.
*02:44.140- 02:47.820* :  At some points, the landslide, a mix of car-sized boulders,
*02:47.820- 02:54.800* :  uprooted trees and churned up earth, was thought to be 8 meters deep, as believed to have been triggered by heavy rains.
*02:55.580- 03:02.140* :  Sehan Actoprak is the chief of the UN migration agency's mission in the South Pacific Island nation.
*03:02.720- 03:14.220* :  One whole community that was situated at the foot of the mountain had been buried under a 6 to 8 meter deep soil.
*03:14.840- 03:28.340* :  The estimated number of houses that is buried under thick debris is approximately 150 and plus, with hoax of saving them alive is shrinking.
*03:29.780- 03:36.680* :  A local official Ignas Nembo visited the scene, and after watching villagers trying to move the rubble with sticks in their hands,
*03:36.680- 03:38.660* :  described the scale of the devastation.
*03:39.060- 03:45.540* :  Currently at the moment, there are a lot of survivors here, mothers, churns, there's an element of school that's buried,
*03:46.700- 03:52.020* :  a fully buried, we have houses, buses, vehicles, hotels, guest houses.
*03:52.980- 03:55.840* :  Let's say more than about 50 stores.
*03:56.960- 04:03.760* :  At the moment, this world is now asking the international government to relocate them to a different area, because this is at the high risk now.
*04:04.260- 04:05.500* :  High risk, he said there.
*04:05.500- 04:11.980* :  And although rescue teams have reached the area, Kalukam, their work is being hampered by rocks blocking roads.
*04:12.600- 04:15.940* :  Scott Wade is a journalist in Port Morsby, the capital.
*04:16.680- 04:20.060* :  Kalukam is located along the Highlands Highway.
*04:20.060- 04:30.160* :  It is a strategic location between the capital capital of Enga, Wabig and a mine, all the poorer mine.
*04:30.720- 04:34.680* :  It's rainy season in the northern part of the country.
*04:34.680- 04:40.440* :  And Enga is in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, and it's been raining over the last two, three months.
*04:41.300- 04:46.120* :  People weren't expecting a lens slip because it never happened before.
*04:47.020- 04:53.680* :  So when it happened at two, three a.m., in the morning, the whole side of the mountain just basically fell off and fell onto a village.
*04:54.100- 04:54.960* :  No warning at all.
*04:55.580- 04:56.460* :  Everybody was asleep.
*04:56.460- 04:57.560* :  It was drizzling.
*04:57.560- 05:00.400* :  So, you know, in the Highlands, it's cold.
*05:00.400- 05:04.900* :  So people were, you know, huddled up in their houses fast asleep when it happened.
*05:05.560- 05:09.740* :  A woman and a man were, a husband and wife were rescued.
*05:09.740- 05:14.340* :  Their house was at the edge of the lens slip area.
*05:14.860- 05:18.140* :  So it didn't bear the brunt of the full force of the lens slip.
*05:18.920- 05:22.040* :  Thankfully, their three children were present at the time.
*05:22.040- 05:28.780* :  So they, they were spared, but the husband and wife were actually thinking that they were going to die.
*05:29.300- 05:36.080* :  And they were trapped under two huge boulders that had prevented additional debris from, from harming them.
*05:36.080- 05:40.360* :  So they were the first two that were pulled out of, of the rubble.
*05:40.880- 05:48.180* :  Scott Wade, just in McMahon is country director of the aid organization care in Papua New Guinea.
*05:48.460- 05:55.180* :  The PNG Defence Force is leading the operation to relocate people to safer ground
*05:55.180- 06:00.560* :  because one of the great issues at the moment is the land is still unstable.
*06:00.560- 06:05.920* :  So they can turn, there'll be further landslides if they move too quickly.
*06:06.260- 06:10.240* :  It must be quite difficult, I would imagine, to access the area as well.
*06:10.460- 06:12.980* :  It's a remote area in the best of times,
*06:13.060- 06:19.560* :  but the landslide is actually destroyed around 200 meters of the main access road.
*06:20.160- 06:24.160* :  So that will further complicate the relief and recovery effort.
*06:24.520- 06:30.700* :  And we're also getting reports of nearby tribal violence, which is complicated recovery efforts.
*06:31.280- 06:34.880* :  Well, sadly, that's been going on for a number of years now.
*06:35.340- 06:41.080* :  And one of the great tragedies is a number of people who had been affected by other tribal
*06:41.120- 06:45.980* :  fights in other parts of the province actually moved to that area for safety.
*06:46.500- 06:50.080* :  And now they've been affected by this landslide.
*06:50.600- 06:57.140* :  You've referred to the role that the PNG Defence Forces are playing in the rescue and recovery
*06:57.140- 07:00.840* :  efforts. What is needed from aid agencies such as yours?
*07:01.300- 07:07.700* :  The response and the longer-term recovery will be immense given the scale of the disaster.
*07:08.380- 07:11.560* :  The immediate needs that the authorities have indicated
*07:12.020- 07:15.320* :  is food, shelter, medical assistance, water.
*07:15.580- 07:18.780* :  But in the next few weeks, there will be psychosocial support.
*07:18.820- 07:23.060* :  We imagine that there will also be protection issues that need to be considered.
*07:23.380- 07:24.380* :  What do you mean by that?
*07:24.740- 07:26.000* :  As in safeguarding.
*07:26.260- 07:32.480* :  So we would expect that there will be an increased number of orphans and female headed households.
*07:32.660- 07:36.680* :  So they are particularly vulnerable in times of emergency.
*07:37.360- 07:42.040* :  So systems need to be put in place to protect those people from abuse.
*07:42.580- 07:46.180* :  I mean, we've been speaking here about the provision of aid,
*07:46.180- 07:52.440* :  but in the immediate future, there must be a need for heavy machinery, for instance,
*07:52.440- 07:56.140* :  to try to clear away some of this debris from the landslide.
*07:56.440- 08:02.900* :  Definitely, but again, I think the authorities, they're certainly acting with some urgency,
*08:02.900- 08:09.240* :  but also with an abundance of caution simply because the land is still so unstable.
*08:09.240- 08:11.840* :  So it's quite a precarious situation.
*08:12.380- 08:14.400* :  Justine McMahon talking to Julian Marshall.
*08:15.740- 08:20.820* :  Palestinian officials in Gaza say that at least 30 people have been killed in a strike on a
*08:20.820- 08:24.520* :  camp for displaced people. These people were in the area.
*08:25.040- 08:32.980* :  Look at these children, torn, what conscience and which religion does this,
*08:33.220- 08:36.560* :  which humanity is this, and where is the world?
*08:38.100- 08:44.500* :  They burn the people. They burnt them. They burnt a whole neighborhood in Tal Al-Sultan.
*08:45.120- 08:47.740* :  People are still burning. What else can I say?
*08:48.780- 08:53.060* :  I cannot say anything. All of a sudden the missile fell on us.
*08:54.440- 08:57.620* :  All the people have burned. Go and see what happened to them.
*08:58.080- 09:00.740* :  Lucy Williamson is following developments from Jerusalem.
*09:01.580- 09:08.260* :  It's still very early days, but the Gaza authorities are accusing Israel of carrying out a strike,
*09:08.260- 09:14.440* :  on what they say was an area where internally displaced people from the fighting had been sheltering.
*09:14.440- 09:19.980* :  Gaza's government information office, as you said, was saying more than 30 people have died,
*09:19.980- 09:26.540* :  dozens have been injured in an area north west of Raffer, and it said 100,000 people were
*09:26.540- 09:31.880* :  sheltering there. Certainly the number of casualties seems to be backed up by hospitals,
*09:31.880- 09:37.080* :  by red crescent workers in the area who say they're transporting and receiving large numbers
*09:37.080- 09:43.200* :  of dead and injured, and that it was a designated humanitarian area that was hit.
*09:43.200- 09:48.680* :  We have asked the Israeli army for a response. We don't have a response yet, but clearly
*09:48.680- 09:54.240* :  there is still a large number of questions to be answered, and we assumed there'll be a response
*09:54.240- 10:00.320* :  coming very soon. I should just say this has happened in the context of Israel's ongoing military
*10:00.320- 10:07.100* :  operation in Raffer, which it says it needs to carry out to target remaining Hamas battalions,
*10:07.100- 10:14.060* :  but there has been stiff resistance, and earlier today we saw a barrage of rockets fired from Raffer
*10:14.460- 10:18.180* :  towards central towns in Israel, including towards Tel Aviv.
*10:18.860- 10:24.020* :  And since Lucy Fahle that report, Israel's military said it had carried out a precise strike
*10:24.020- 10:29.740* :  on a Hamas compound in the southern city of Raffer, but that it was reviewing the incident,
*10:29.740- 10:34.720* :  following reports that the strike had caused a fire and civilians had been harmed.
*10:35.880- 10:40.140* :  To Nigeria now, a country that is once again being plagued by a kidnapping crisis.
*10:40.780- 10:44.200* :  It's estimated that nearly 5,000 people have been abducted since President
*10:44.200- 10:49.680* :  Bulletin Nubu came into power last May. The attacks are often carried out by militant groups
*10:49.680- 10:55.660* :  who then hold those kidnap for a ransom. And now authorities say 160 people have been taken
*10:55.660- 11:02.560* :  by gunmen from a remote village in Niger state. Our Africa regional editor is Will Ross.
*11:02.920- 11:10.260* :  The BBC has spoken to an official called Aminu Najume, who's the local official in the
*11:10.260- 11:15.760* :  Munya local government area. So somebody who ought to know exactly what's going on, and he's
*11:15.760- 11:23.940* :  given very precise details. He's talked about a huge group of heavily armed men riding on motorbikes,
*11:24.420- 11:31.280* :  arriving in the village, Kutchy village, and then basically spending the next two hours, at least
*11:31.320- 11:35.000* :  two hours, because we've heard from somebody else they were there for even longer than that,
*11:35.840- 11:43.520* :  starting off by cooking food, making themselves tea, and then going house to house abducting people,
*11:43.520- 11:49.300* :  as well as stealing items that they were getting in a car to weigh with them. But he talked about
*11:50.000- 11:54.920* :  the fact that they were there that long. He also said that there was a local, what they call
*11:54.920- 11:59.580* :  a hunting force, but this is kind of like a local defense group that's been hired to defend the
*11:59.580- 12:04.700* :  air, and they were completely overrun, and about ten people killed, including several of these
*12:04.700- 12:10.100* :  hunters. It seems extraordinary that the arrogance of it to seem relaxed enough to hang around and
*12:10.100- 12:15.000* :  have some tea. I suppose a lot of these groups, they realise that the security forces can't be
*12:15.000- 12:19.500* :  everywhere at once, the police can't be everywhere, and they can just get away with it. I mean,
*12:19.500- 12:25.540* :  is there much that the authorities can do? It's difficult to say, we know that last month in an
*12:25.540- 12:31.840* :  area not far from this, the army was called to an emergency when they'd been an attack. They were
*12:31.840- 12:38.120* :  ambushed, and at least six soldiers were killed, so that's the kind of danger that the soldiers face
*12:38.120- 12:45.420* :  when they'd respond to this. But in another interview that this same official gave to the BBC
*12:45.420- 12:51.500* :  House of Service, he said that the gunmen had flags that looked like the jihadist flags of the
*12:51.500- 12:56.600* :  group Boko Haram, which normally operates in the northeast of the country. This is in Niger
*12:56.600- 13:02.340* :  State, in the north central area, where there have been quite a lot of attacks, but up until now we
*13:02.340- 13:08.000* :  haven't really known of these sort of gangs who were just after money and abducting people for
*13:08.000- 13:14.440* :  that reason, or is there more of a religious element, and are they tied to Islamist militant groups?
*13:14.720- 13:18.300* :  And if that's confirmed, that really would be a concern for the authorities so close to the
*13:18.300- 13:23.460* :  capital of Abuja. That's true. I mean, this is not a huge distance from the capital of Abuja,
*13:23.460- 13:28.760* :  even though it's a remote area, and the fact that there's been so much uncertainty about whether
*13:29.600- 13:34.480* :  the jihadists have links to the kidnapping gangs, if that's what's happened here, that would be
*13:34.480- 13:38.740* :  a real problem. But the fact that they were there so long, that's what people are going to look at
*13:38.740- 13:45.260* :  and say, why didn't the authorities respond? Will Ross, it is certainly not the best of times for
*13:45.260- 13:50.980* :  people who have a fear of flying. On Tuesday, one person died and several were injured when a
*13:50.980- 13:57.220* :  Singapore Airlines aircraft hit severe turbulence over the Indian Ocean. And now, on Sunday,
*13:57.220- 14:03.860* :  12 people have been injured on a flight from Doha to Dublin, the Boeing 7879 Dreamliner experienced
*14:03.860- 14:09.500* :  turbulence whilst it was airborne over Turkey. The flight landed safely at Dublin Airport,
*14:09.500- 14:13.800* :  where these passengers explained what had happened. Just going over Baghdad,
*14:14.680- 14:18.320* :  we just felt the plane different about five seconds, and next to us, we saw the flight
*14:18.320- 14:22.580* :  attending, just go up in the air and come straight back down. There was a lot of people looking around
*14:22.580- 14:27.600* :  asking what was going on. It was really sudden, like, food went everywhere. There was
*14:27.820- 14:32.000* :  panic, the look of panic everywhere, and some of the flight attendants I saw, they had like
*14:32.000- 14:36.440* :  scratches on their face, they had ice to their face, there was one girl that had a sling on her arm.
*14:36.780- 14:42.440* :  We just so relieved, like, that we made it home okay. That's all. It was very scary.
*14:42.440- 14:47.680* :  It was the worst experience, honestly. I'm never playing, I've been flying back and forth for
*14:47.680- 14:53.740* :  years, and I was really scary. To be honest, I'm still showering, right? It was for the 10-15
*14:53.740- 14:59.260* :  seconds, and that was the worst 15 seconds of my life, and I've seen a few people. They were like
*14:59.620- 15:05.400* :  literally flying in the plane, so they were on the top of the plane, but by the God, we are here.
*15:08.220- 15:14.660* :  Still to come. If we want to push the Russians to the border, then I think it will take one or two
*15:14.660- 15:21.060* :  years, and if there is no support, then this world will go on and on. We're on the front line in
*15:21.060- 15:26.500* :  Ukraine as soldiers call for more help from the West, including permission to attack Russia within
*15:26.500- 15:27.000* :  its borders.
*15:36.260- 15:40.940* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*15:41.180- 15:46.140* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising

*16:50.040- 16:55.820* :  Welcome back. The Georgian Prime Minister has accused the president of betrayal in an official
*16:55.820- 17:01.700* :  ceremony to mark the anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union on Sunday. The two leaders
*17:01.700- 17:07.460* :  are on opposite sides of a fierce debate over a new law on the funding of civil society groups
*17:07.900- 17:14.140* :  and independent media. During a speech in Tbilisi, president Salami Zura Bishvili alluded to Russia
*17:14.140- 17:22.540* :  as an enemy of Georgia. Today, as the specter of Russia looms over us,
*17:22.860- 17:27.600* :  partnership and reprochement with Europe are the true paths of preserving and strengthening
*17:27.600- 17:33.740* :  our independence and peace. Those who sabotage and undermine this path trample upon and
*17:33.740- 17:38.580* :  damage the peaceful and secure future of our country, hindering the path towards becoming
*17:38.580- 17:45.500* :  a full member of the free and democratic world. Our correspondent Ray Hendermy Tree spent the day
*17:45.500- 17:51.000* :  on the streets of the capital. I'm standing on this central avenue where there was a street party
*17:51.000- 17:56.340* :  all day long. There's very colorful bunting in the colors of the Georgian flag red and white.
*17:57.060- 18:03.100* :  But a bit further up the same street. There are thousands of people who are once again out
*18:03.100- 18:09.460* :  in the streets protesting against this controversial law on the transparency of foreign influence,
*18:10.200- 18:16.200* :  which they have been protesting for many weeks now. And where it's heading next is the Georgian
*18:16.200- 18:22.460* :  Dreamlet Parliament is set to override the presidential veto earlier at the official ceremony
*18:22.460- 18:28.820* :  celebration. The Prime Minister did indeed accuse the president Salami Zura Bishvili of betrayal
*18:28.900- 18:35.380* :  because she vetoed this legislation last week. And from what you've seen, Ray Hend,
*18:35.380- 18:40.400* :  about this strength of the opposition to this, even when that does go through finally,
*18:40.400- 18:46.040* :  the opposition, when imagines, will take to the streets again. Well, this protest they have been
*18:46.040- 18:53.260* :  led to largely by Georgian youth and they have been decentralized. So there's no big one opposition
*18:53.260- 18:59.040* :  party that is the driving force behind this protest. But President Zura Bishvili, she's having
*18:59.040- 19:05.260* :  now a celebratory concert outside her residence. She delivered another speech and she called for
*19:05.260- 19:11.000* :  the creation of the Georgian charter. She invited all opposition parties to unite ahead of the
*19:11.000- 19:16.280* :  October parliamentary elections. Ray Hend, a meat tree. As we record this podcast,
*19:16.280- 19:21.460* :  16 people are known to have been killed in Saturday's Russian attack on a DIY store
*19:21.460- 19:27.400* :  in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. More than 40 were wounded. Kharkiv has been targeted
*19:27.400- 19:32.480* :  regularly by missiles and glide bombs in recent weeks. As Russia tries to seize more villages
*19:32.480- 19:37.660* :  to the north and northeast of the city. President Zelensky has said the strike is another
*19:37.660- 19:43.160* :  manifestation of Russian madness and the attack underlines the anxiety that Ukrainians feel
*19:43.160- 19:48.420* :  about not having suitable air defenses. They're again calling on the west to lift restrictions
*19:48.420- 19:54.460* :  on the use of western supplied weapons in order to strike targets inside Russia and prevent
*19:54.460- 20:00.300* :  similar attacks on them. For the moment, Ukraine is largely relying on artillery and drones to push
*20:00.300- 20:04.500* :  the Russians back. Our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel reports from the frontline.
*20:10.240- 20:13.380* :  These are now one of the most potent weapons of this war.
*20:14.120- 20:18.780* :  Cheap mass-produced small drones being used to deadly effect.
*20:25.360- 20:29.800* :  And here on the frontline, they're helping Ukraine slow Russia's advance.
*20:31.020- 20:35.100* :  But Anton, one of the pilots, says drones are not enough.
*20:38.620- 20:42.580* :  We observed the Russian buildup before they invaded. We saw the equipment
*20:42.580- 20:48.280* :  they artillery, the tanks. But the means and forces we had that our disposal,
*20:49.160- 20:56.320* :  Soviet-made or Ukrainian, were insufficient. We can hold them back with drones and hurt them badly,
*20:56.320- 21:02.660* :  but we're in with them unfortunately now. What do you call them? This is Piki Blinders.
*21:03.100- 21:08.700* :  It's what they call themselves. Piki blinders after their favourite cult TV series.
*21:09.640- 21:13.920* :  They even wear flat caps embroidered with their motto to find and destroy.
*21:15.080- 21:20.700* :  But that's where the similarity ends. Then our battle hardened. They've also been trained by
*21:20.700- 21:29.640* :  western special forces. They say they've already killed or injured more than 100 Russian soldiers
*21:30.280- 21:35.660* :  in just the past few weeks. Anton's younger brother, Alexander, is their leader.
*21:36.500- 21:40.020* :  It's the second time he's fought for this territory, his home.
*21:41.100- 21:46.580* :  He once farmed the fields nearby, growing strawberries, now he's planting bombs.
*21:47.540- 21:50.980* :  But he still knows this is unlikely to bring an end to this war.
*21:54.500- 21:59.240* :  Right now, it's like two more relas equal gladiators fighting each other and neither can defeat
*21:59.240- 22:04.180* :  the other. Yes, the conflict might be frozen maybe for several years or even decades,
*22:04.180- 22:11.800* :  but this war will last a very long time. It's a bit like he threw here the number of drones
*22:11.800- 22:18.920* :  they're flying. Dozens of drones going in and out, not just drones to target Russian forces,
*22:18.920- 22:24.060* :  but also they've got a drone up which is going to a location where they killed some Russian troops,
*22:25.060- 22:28.980* :  trying to take the weapon they have. It's got a grappling hook on it.
*22:32.140- 22:35.620* :  So you're stealing Russian rifles from the Russians?
*22:37.700- 22:42.460* :  Success in stealing a rifle, but frustration for the Peaky Blinders,
*22:42.460- 22:48.460* :  when they do find a new target. As Anton flies a kamikaze drone right towards it,
*22:48.460- 22:54.420* :  their signal gets jammed. They lose contact. The Russians are learning too.
*22:54.780- 23:01.360* :  Russian drones are also as much of a threat to Ukrainian forces. On another part of the Hakhir
*23:01.360- 23:09.340* :  Front, they're trying to shoot one down. A Ukrainian mortar team nearby are making the most
*23:09.340- 23:15.300* :  of the cover from a forest. Easy now in spring, but harder in winter. What a thrill!
*23:17.180- 23:23.380* :  Ukraine says it has now slowed down the Russian Front Line. It has stabilized the situation,
*23:24.060- 23:29.480* :  but they're still quite a fierce artillery battle going on. They're much harder task will be to push
*23:29.480- 23:37.180* :  the Russians back. For both sides, it's a constant game of hide and seek.
*23:39.780- 23:43.080* :  Vlad, the commander here, admits that went be easy.
*23:44.640- 23:49.120* :  If we want to push the Russians to the border, then I think it will take one or two years.
*23:49.720- 23:52.940* :  And if there is no support, then this war will go on and on.
*23:53.560- 23:59.500* :  That report by Jonathan Biel. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to cyclones.
*23:59.640- 24:05.020* :  It sits just north of the Bay of Bengal. A much of the country near there is just a few meters
*24:05.020- 24:10.520* :  above sea level, so the country is on higher alert at the moment, because a powerful storm
*24:10.520- 24:15.680* :  called cyclone remal has just made landfall. So far, there are reports that one person has
*24:15.680- 24:21.500* :  drowned in rough seas with a surge of water of up to three meters expected in some areas.
*24:22.140- 24:25.260* :  Meanwhile, the authorities have evacuated hundreds of thousands of people,
*24:25.820- 24:28.420* :  but some are a little unconvinced by the government's plan.
*24:31.840- 24:34.960* :  I will leave my livestock and home and go to the shelter if necessary,
*24:35.480- 24:39.780* :  but I don't care much about the cyclone. It's the same for us whether we go to the shelter or not.
*24:43.260- 24:47.900* :  I don't trust the cyclone shelters. If there's a large surge in coming,
*24:47.900- 24:50.740* :  it will not stay intact. This is my fear.
*24:51.840- 24:54.720* :  Ambra Saneti Rajan is our South Asia regional editor.
*24:55.180- 24:59.860* :  The main worry for the authorities is when the cyclone is hitting the land,
*25:00.540- 25:04.540* :  because you have low tide and high tide in the coastal areas of Bangladesh,
*25:05.380- 25:10.100* :  but if they come during the high tide, that can trigger a storm surge.
*25:10.640- 25:15.780* :  But as we are hearing from the Bangladesh Met Officials, that at the moment there is a low tide,
*25:16.440- 25:22.460* :  the cyclone has already started making a landfall, so they're not expecting the worst at the moment,
*25:22.460- 25:27.860* :  but then the eye of the storm, and it crosses later in the night, that time we have to wait and see
*25:27.860- 25:34.060* :  what kind of tidal surge it's going to create. Now, for the people there, there are two things to
*25:34.060- 25:38.940* :  worry about. On the one hand, if they stay in their homes, their houses will be inundated,
*25:39.480- 25:44.140* :  but on the other hand, they don't want to move away from the house and go to storm shelters.
*25:44.140- 25:49.880* :  Basically, they were schools, government offices. They are like dual purpose buildings, so they go
*25:49.880- 25:54.320* :  up there, only the first floor, and stay there. But then, who will look after the livestock?
*25:54.700- 25:58.440* :  And what happened to the household belongings? People can take them away.
*25:58.960- 26:03.220* :  So, this is also a challenge for authorities to convince them to move. Don't wait for
*26:03.220- 26:08.640* :  till the last moment. So, there's no doubt that better warning systems and better storm shelters
*26:09.060- 26:13.820* :  have saved many, many lives in recent cyclones, but there's this worry that people have,
*26:13.820- 26:19.480* :  if they go to them, what about their possessions? And long-term, there must be a real concern
*26:19.480- 26:24.820* :  about the viability of many communities there, because as sea levels rise, it's going to become
*26:24.820- 26:30.060* :  increasingly difficult, isn't it? The cyclone preparedness has improved quite dramatically in the
*26:30.260- 26:36.560* :  15 years in Bangladesh, because they have a very organized system, where first, the volunteers
*26:36.560- 26:42.520* :  will go to various villages, urging people through loudspeakers to vacate, and then they send messages,
*26:42.520- 26:48.120* :  mass messages on mobile phones, urging people to leave, so that people can always come back to
*26:48.120- 26:54.220* :  the homes after the storm. But the second aspect itself is, most of the areas, of course,
*26:54.220- 27:00.100* :  areas of Bangladesh, will be about two meters or one meter above sea level. So, in the long run,
*27:00.140- 27:04.560* :  what the people say is because of climate change, the intensity of these cyclones increase,
*27:05.100- 27:09.460* :  and the sea level rise. That is the main worry, what will happen in the long term? That's why
*27:09.940- 27:15.660* :  you see tens of thousands of people have been migrating to cities like Dhaka further up north,
*27:15.660- 27:21.300* :  because they say, suddenly one island has been submerged, or the water level has increased,
*27:21.300- 27:26.480* :  or salinity has increased, affecting the livelihood. So, the problems are multifaceted,
*27:26.880- 27:29.320* :  what they call us, creating climate refugees.
*27:30.260- 27:36.020* :  Ambrassan, it's a margin. Pretty much every major city in the Western Hemisphere has a problem
*27:36.020- 27:42.080* :  with pigeons, but is the problem really with our attitude towards the birds? Some people fix them.
*27:42.080- 27:46.380* :  The breed of pigeons that live in our cities are, in fact, called city delves,
*27:46.380- 27:53.260* :  Rachel Wright reports. As the American singer Tom Lara says in 1959, we just love poisoning
*27:53.260- 27:59.240* :  pigeons in the park. A little cruel perhaps, but for most of our history, the poor old pigeon
*27:59.240- 28:06.060* :  has had a bad rap. Skyrats, dirty, the carriers of disease, pigeons have been hated and hunted as long
*28:06.060- 28:12.300* :  as I can remember. But now a certain TikTok influencer has decided enough is enough. She came
*28:12.300- 28:19.800* :  across an injured pigeon in a British pub in 2022. She looked young and she looked like she needed
*28:19.800- 28:25.420* :  some help. I found out that she'd been kicked about in the pub that we were at earlier on,
*28:25.420- 28:31.980* :  so I think she was pretty scared. She wasn't in a good way. So Hannah Hall adopted the pigeon,
*28:31.980- 28:39.460* :  named her Penny, and put a film of her on TikTok. Today she has received 27 million views of her
*28:39.460- 28:45.540* :  video and is now set up a charity called Penny's Pigeon Aid to improve the image of the birds.
*28:46.160- 28:48.540* :  So why have they got such a bad image?
*28:52.760- 28:58.380* :  According to Hannah Hall, a newspaper report in the 1960s wrongly blamed two deaths on pigeon
*28:58.380- 29:03.900* :  dropping. And then first the New York Commissioner and then Woody Allen started using the term rats
*29:03.900- 29:10.280* :  with wings which seem to stick. Professor Charles Walcott has spent most of his life studying pigeons.
*29:10.280- 29:16.580* :  He says they're not dirty nor do they carry disease and are in fact a magnificently intelligent
*29:16.580- 29:21.920* :  animal with an amazing sense of navigation, which is why they're trained as homing pigeons.
*29:22.840- 29:28.780* :  You can take one of these pigeons a thousand miles or more in any direction from the home loft,
*29:28.780- 29:35.620* :  let them go and they fly home. Hannah Hall makes TikTok videos to show how heroic pigeons not
*29:35.620- 29:43.180* :  only deliver messages, hence pigeon post, but are also fantastic pets and not just for men aged over
*29:43.180- 29:48.740* :  70. The oil affectionate and intelligent plus they were actually bred to be with humans. They
*29:48.740- 29:52.600* :  wouldn't even be here if it weren't for us because we domesticated them, pigeon served humans
*29:52.600- 29:56.660* :  for thousands of years including in World War Two and they deserve some love and gratitude
*29:56.660- 30:01.900* :  and believe me if you show them affection they'll show it you back. Hannah says they can be trained
*30:01.900- 30:07.640* :  to do tricks, recognize faces and with the right diet even their poo can be easily cleaned up.
*30:07.940- 30:13.400* :  She hopes her charity can educate people not to fall in love with pigeons, but just to be humane
*30:13.420- 30:18.440* :  and not cause any unnecessary cruelty. Someone needs to tell Tom Lara that.
*30:19.580- 30:20.520* :  Rachel Wright reporting.
