*01:24.200- 01:24.820* :  I'm Nick Miles.
*01:24.820- 01:28.320* :  And in the early hours of Friday, the 24th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:28.920- 01:34.400* :  The US Justice Department is seeking the breakup of the owner of Ticketmaster, accusing
*01:34.400- 01:40.680* :  the massive entertainment firm of harming concert goers and artists through an illegal monopoly.
*01:41.640- 01:47.220* :  Louisiana's legislature has designated two commonly prescribed abortion pills as dangerous
*01:47.220- 01:50.580* :  controlled substances in a first for the United States.
*01:51.380- 01:56.900* :  A BBC team has met doctors treating resistance fighters in Myanmar who've spoken of horrific
*01:56.900- 02:00.520* :  injuries sustained during the war against the military rulers.
*02:03.420- 02:08.300* :  Also in this podcast, we see entire galaxy clusters, but also small planets up to four
*02:08.300- 02:09.480* :  times the mass of Jupiter.
*02:09.960- 02:12.380* :  We see regions where new stars are forming.
*02:12.380- 02:18.740* :  The European Space Agency says its Euclid telescope has sent back the largest images of
*02:18.740- 02:20.840* :  the universe ever taken from space.
*02:24.900- 02:30.160* :  For the companies selling them, tickets for live shows and concerts are big business.
*02:30.800- 02:35.420* :  And for the fans trying to buy the tickets, things could often get pretty emotional.
*02:35.920- 02:41.520* :  For the ones that fully crash and it will be back in the beginning, and they're weeding
*02:41.520- 02:42.160* :  it hard.
*02:43.420- 02:44.860* :  We're like six hours.
*02:44.860- 02:46.820* :  I'm so sorry now.
*02:48.000- 02:55.180* :  That was Taylor Swift fans upset in November 2022 when ticket masters website crashed during
*02:55.180- 02:58.220* :  a pre-sale period for her era's tour.
*02:58.760- 03:03.080* :  But it wasn't just technical difficulties that frustrated potential concert goers.
*03:03.540- 03:06.320* :  There were also complaints of high prices.
*03:06.780- 03:10.400* :  And it's that part, which has come under the microscope on Thursday.
*03:10.800- 03:15.960* :  As the US Department of Justice announced that it has brought a case against the entertainment
*03:15.960- 03:17.440* :  giant live nation.
*03:17.440- 03:19.420* :  The parent company of ticket master.
*03:19.980- 03:24.900* :  The lawsuit alleges that the business which puts on concerts, sells tickets and owns
*03:24.900- 03:31.040* :  venues has squeezed out competitors and weakened customer choice, which in turn helps to
*03:31.040- 03:31.840* :  push up prices.
*03:32.280- 03:34.560* :  Here's the US Attorney General, Merrick Garland.
*03:34.920- 03:41.000* :  It is time for fans and artists to stop paying the price for live nation's monopoly.
*03:41.820- 03:46.740* :  It is time to restore competition and innovation in the entertainment industry.
*03:47.640- 03:51.660* :  It is time to break up live nation ticket master.
*03:52.660- 03:55.380* :  The American people are ready for it.
*03:56.080- 04:01.240* :  I spoke to our North America business correspondent Aaron Delmore and asked her, how did this all
*04:01.240- 04:03.300* :  come about and why this development now?
*04:03.600- 04:07.260* :  You know, this is something that has been in the spotlight for a long time now.
*04:07.540- 04:10.700* :  And especially came to a head during the era's tour ticket sales.
*04:10.700- 04:12.900* :  Like you mentioned, fans were very upset.
*04:12.900- 04:15.620* :  But also there were congressional hearings about this.
*04:15.660- 04:18.580* :  And I got the attention of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
*04:19.040- 04:21.980* :  Now ticket master and live nation merged 14 years ago.
*04:22.340- 04:26.280* :  And even then it was seen as an entity that could grow to be quite large.
*04:26.740- 04:30.100* :  And in fact, it is what the Justice Department is arguing should be broken up today.
*04:30.100- 04:34.380* :  So to hear Attorney General Merrick Garland come out and talk about it, he painted live
*04:34.380- 04:37.960* :  nation ticket masters being ubiquitous in the live entertainment industry.
*04:38.500- 04:42.780* :  And he said that it controls at least 80% of primary ticketing in major concert venues,
*04:43.160- 04:48.860* :  he manages more than 400 artists and controls more than 60% of concert promotions across
*04:48.860- 04:49.420* :  the country.
*04:49.840- 04:54.000* :  And he also said that it owns or controls more than 60% of large amphitheaters across
*04:54.000- 04:54.520* :  the country.
*04:54.920- 05:00.980* :  So he talked about how those factors taken together can grow at expand and reinforce live
*05:00.980- 05:04.020* :  nation ticket masters business, almost like a revolving wheel.
*05:04.500- 05:08.580* :  And that's why, as he said very clearly in the sound bite you just ran, he said it needs
*05:08.580- 05:09.360* :  to be broken up.
*05:09.620- 05:13.220* :  And it's a lawsuit that was joined by 29 states and the District of Columbia.
*05:13.220- 05:17.280* :  And this is something that they say could upend a multi-billion dollar industry.
*05:17.480- 05:21.200* :  It sounds from what you're saying that live nation has done nothing illegal.
*05:21.200- 05:25.720* :  It's just rather good at what it does, what's it said about today's ruling?
*05:25.980- 05:30.460* :  You know, live nation makes that argument to a degree, but also says that there is competition
*05:30.580- 05:35.540* :  in the field and that they don't make the kind of profit margins that you would expect
*05:35.540- 05:38.820* :  to see for the behavior that is being described, right?
*05:38.820- 05:44.220* :  And so, you know, live nation has come out and said that look at public demand, look at
*05:44.220- 05:47.280* :  how much people are willing to pay for tickets on a secondary market.
*05:47.280- 05:50.700* :  They're talking about scalpers, they're talking about resale websites and they're saying,
*05:50.700- 05:55.240* :  how can we be charging too much if we can clearly demonstrate to you that the public is willing
*05:55.240- 05:55.960* :  to pay more?
*05:56.220- 05:59.700* :  And they also say that there are competitors and rivals that they contend with and they
*05:59.700- 06:00.760* :  deny being a monopoly.
*06:01.320- 06:02.120* :  Erin Delmore.
*06:03.160- 06:09.880* :  Louisiana has become the first US state to designate two commonly used abortion pills as dangerous
*06:09.880- 06:11.220* :  controlled substances.
*06:11.800- 06:16.920* :  Anyone possessing the drugs without a prescription could face jail time and thousands of dollars
*06:16.920- 06:17.540* :  and fines.
*06:18.360- 06:24.360* :  Abortion advocates fear this will now see other states crack down on the most used method
*06:24.360- 06:25.660* :  of abortion in America.
*06:26.360- 06:30.760* :  From North America correspondent Nomi Iqbal, tell me more about the impact of this new
*06:31.420- 06:31.440* :  legislation.
*06:32.100- 06:35.780* :  Well, we know it definitely won't be pregnant women with a prescription.
*06:36.140- 06:41.920* :  So, it's important to say that this legislation doesn't prohibit these drugs from being prescribed
*06:41.920- 06:48.500* :  and dispensed in Louisiana for legal and legitimate reasons, whether people will be able to
*06:48.500- 06:54.360* :  get a prescription is another issue because classifying drugs this way imposes sort of certain
*06:54.360- 06:58.720* :  logistical hurdles like, you know, you might get extra steps for calling prescriptions
*06:58.720- 07:01.400* :  into pharmacies and you may need paper prescriptions.
*07:01.400- 07:07.580* :  But really this bill when it becomes law which is inevitable, it means it will target volunteers
*07:08.320- 07:11.080* :  or anyone who has the pills but not a prescription.
*07:11.160- 07:15.400* :  So there may be women who just have these pills anyway, even if they're not pregnant because
*07:15.400- 07:17.640* :  these pills are used for other reasons.
*07:18.720- 07:23.660* :  And what supporters of the bill are saying people will be prevented from unlawfully
*07:24.040- 07:24.880* :  using the pills.
*07:25.100- 07:29.540* :  But, you know, hundreds of doctors were against the ban because Miffa Pristone and Miser
*07:29.540- 07:35.440* :  Prostol have other common uses, as I mentioned, such as treating miscarriages, inducing labour
*07:35.440- 07:37.300* :  and stopping hemorrhaging as well.
*07:37.820- 07:45.140* :  And the other thing to add here is that by designating these drugs this way enables Louisiana
*07:45.140- 07:48.600* :  to now create a database essentially of who's receiving them.
*07:48.820- 07:51.660* :  And are other states likely to follow, do you think?
*07:51.860- 07:55.040* :  There is a potential for that, especially deeply conservative states.
*07:55.300- 08:00.040* :  Remember Louisiana has a near total abortion ban in place and that applies both to medical
*08:00.040- 08:01.540* :  and surgical abortions.
*08:01.700- 08:06.040* :  The only exception to the span or if there is a substantial risk of death or impairment
*08:06.040- 08:10.500* :  to the mother if she continues the pregnancy but there's been lots of issues around that
*08:10.500- 08:14.980* :  because there have been examples of that happening where women say they haven't got
*08:14.980- 08:16.160* :  the help that they need.
*08:16.160- 08:21.100* :  But yes, potentially other very conservative states that have got these near total abortion
*08:21.100- 08:24.700* :  bans could look at Louisiana and think let's try that as well.
*08:24.920- 08:30.700* :  And is there any connection do you think timing wise between this and the November election?
*08:31.120- 08:36.020* :  During the midterm elections it was pretty much proven in the results that people were
*08:36.020- 08:40.700* :  really angry about Roe v Wade, the national right to abortion being overturned.
*08:41.120- 08:45.540* :  In Louisiana, very deeply conservative state, I think there's very little indication so
*08:45.540- 08:51.120* :  far that a broad sort of amount of the state's electorate will turn against state lawmakers
*08:51.120- 08:54.660* :  for their continued efforts to curb abortion access.
*08:55.200- 08:55.940* :  Nomiya Iqbal.
*08:56.880- 09:03.220* :  Next to Myanmar, the conflict in the country is a textbook case of asymmetric warfare.
*09:03.760- 09:08.360* :  On the one side are the various rebel groups with their cobbled together uniforms and weaponry.
*09:08.360- 09:12.940* :  On the other are the modern fighter jets and tanks of the military junta.
*09:13.380- 09:18.660* :  And yet it is the rebel groups that are advancing right across the country as much as two thirds
*09:18.660- 09:23.580* :  of Myanmar, mostly the countryside, may now be under the control of the resistance.
*09:24.340- 09:27.820* :  More or more young people are fleeing the cities to join the rebellion.
*09:27.820- 09:33.260* :  Some have taken up arms, but others, doctors and teachers, are supporting the insurgency
*09:33.260- 09:34.580* :  with skills of their own.
*09:35.180- 09:40.380* :  Access to the country is very difficult, hundreds of journalists have been jailed, but our correspondent
*09:40.380- 09:46.700* :  Somerville has managed to get inside and spend a month in Kareni and Shan states in the east
*09:46.700- 09:51.720* :  of the country, with young revolutionaries at their jungle hideouts and on the front lines.
*09:51.740- 09:54.960* :  In this report, he's gained access to a secret hospital.
*09:57.960- 10:00.940* :  We've just come off a jungle track into a hospital.
*10:01.340- 10:09.780* :  There's about 35 medical staff here and beds for about 60 plus patients.
*10:10.100- 10:16.300* :  When we first came to Kareni, our first idea was to carry a gun and to fight that we
*10:16.300- 10:18.740* :  realized that there was not enough health care services.
*10:18.980- 10:25.000* :  Dr. Yuri's 23 years old, he expected to join his sister as a doctor once he'd finished
*10:25.000- 10:28.580* :  medical school, instead the coup happened and he joined the revolution.
*10:29.020- 10:37.300* :  We are originally from Yangol and we are very active in strikes and protests and we have
*10:37.300- 10:38.620* :  to flee from Yangol.
*10:39.060- 10:43.940* :  Dr. Yuri, like thousands of young people, grew up with a tantalizing taste of democratic
*10:43.940- 10:44.440* :  freedom.
*10:45.140- 10:50.060* :  When it was snatched away, he and others took to the streets and joined in acts of civil
*10:50.060- 10:50.860* :  disobedience.
*10:51.360- 10:53.420* :  They were met with violence and arrest.
*10:54.180- 10:57.400* :  Tens of thousands have been killed, many of them children.
*11:00.520- 11:08.620* :  On the wards here, I say it's a ward, it's a tarpaulin, a bamboo pole on a dirt floor,
*11:10.320- 11:11.160* :  but it doesn't have patients.
*11:12.300- 11:17.320* :  Some of them missing limbs from what looks like lying my neck since others were strapping
*11:17.320- 11:17.640* :  the wounds.
*11:19.500- 11:20.400* :  It's one fight I hear.
*11:20.840- 11:26.460* :  He lost his right foot, his injuries to his arms, to and to his neck.
*11:27.240- 11:29.040* :  His name's Storm, he's 32 years old.
*11:30.120- 11:31.680* :  And what is the future hold for you now?
*11:32.420- 11:32.660* :  I don't know.
*11:33.240- 11:33.920* :  That I am mad.
*11:33.960- 11:40.960* :  So he thinks that he will be in the revolution, helping his comrades not in fighting, but
*11:41.020- 11:42.820* :  in other ways he can help out.
*11:45.520- 11:48.200* :  The operating theater here is underground.
*11:51.600- 11:57.880* :  The reason the operation theater is underground is because if we are over the ground, they
*11:57.880- 11:58.860* :  can see us.
*11:59.560- 12:01.700* :  And if they see us, they will bomb us.
*12:02.920- 12:06.280* :  The doctor carrying out the operation is Tracy, Doctor Yuri's partner.
*12:06.600- 12:10.420* :  We've met some of the wounded here today, horrible injuries.
*12:10.840- 12:14.420* :  How do you both cope with that mentally?
*12:14.940- 12:17.520* :  Sometimes we can cry the whole day.
*12:18.020- 12:20.000* :  It's okay, but we have to stand up again.
*12:20.860- 12:24.320* :  Kareni State has become a magnet for young revolutionaries.
*12:24.880- 12:29.780* :  Since their armed uprising last November, some 90% of it is now under opposition control.
*12:29.780- 12:35.100* :  And across Myanmar, as much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the insurgents,
*12:35.460- 12:36.660* :  mostly in rural areas.
*12:37.380- 12:41.720* :  But they don't control the skies, and there's still a threat from air strikes and artillery.
*12:42.820- 12:48.660* :  No one to go, no one to leave.
*12:49.740- 12:55.220* :  Doctors Yuri and Tracy haven't taken up arms, but their revolutionaries nonetheless.
*12:56.440- 13:01.500* :  They don't expect the war will end anytime soon, so they do what they can, tending the
*13:01.500- 13:03.260* :  sick and caring for children.
*13:04.060- 13:09.640* :  They've left lives and families behind, but it's a worthwhile sacrifice to build the Myanmar
*13:09.680- 13:10.440* :  where they were promised.
*13:11.160- 13:15.420* :  And the threat from the Hunters, warplanes and artillery won't stop them trying.
*13:20.240- 13:22.920* :  That report was by Quentin Somerville in Myanmar.
*13:24.280- 13:28.980* :  Now, to the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
*13:29.220- 13:34.500* :  The French President, Emmanuel Macron, says he will seek a new political agreement on
*13:35.220- 13:36.980* :  controversial voting reforms for the region.
*13:37.480- 13:44.000* :  At least six people have died in recent unrest sparked by the plans, or the protests in New Caledonia,
*13:44.440- 13:50.320* :  have been led by the indigenous Canack community who were concerned that their political power could be diluted.
*13:50.980- 13:52.520* :  Many want independence from France.
*13:52.620- 13:57.800* :  Mr. Macron has sent thousands of extra troops to the area to try to restore calm.
*13:58.520- 14:04.240* :  Mr. Macron promised more dialogue after meeting Canack leaders during a trip to the main island.
*14:07.900- 14:12.200* :  I have pledged that this reform will not be forced through in the current context,
*14:12.280- 14:19.760* :  and that we will allow some weeks to allow a calming of tensions and a resumption of dialogue to find a broad consensus.
*14:21.540- 14:28.300* :  Huscofield is our correspondent in the French capital Paris, where there's considerable interest in what happens in the Pacific territory
*14:28.300- 14:31.900* :  because of its strategic importance as a source of raw materials.
*14:32.360- 14:37.620* :  That will be why the future of New Caledonia is such a contentious issue for people living there.
*14:38.240- 14:41.500* :  Things are very tense out there. Things have been tense for a long time.
*14:41.500- 14:46.380* :  There are inherent fault lines in the setup in New Caledonia.
*14:46.380- 14:50.800* :  There are two communities, as well known. There's the Canack in indigenous community,
*14:50.800- 14:56.080* :  and then there's the subsequent arrivals, some of them have been there for generations' generation.
*14:56.760- 15:01.120* :  And there is a pro-independence movement, which is largely among the Canacks,
*15:01.220- 15:06.380* :  who want to make a break with France and who see it all in the colonial terms,
*15:06.380- 15:08.580* :  and they're backed by men, people on the left in France.
*15:08.980- 15:13.700* :  And then there are the people who say, no, we're very lucky to have this relationship with France.
*15:13.700- 15:17.920* :  We want to move to a new kind of relationship and have powers of our own here,
*15:17.920- 15:23.920* :  but we have our identity, and we believe that we can keep it in close contact with the mother country.
*15:24.260- 15:30.040* :  So you have these two communities, which have always been at odds with each other,
*15:30.040- 15:37.060* :  but have co-existed and have run their lives, together thanks to periodic political settlements,
*15:37.160- 15:41.120* :  which are kind of imposed by Paris after long consultations.
*15:41.160- 15:46.140* :  And back in the 80s, there was a crisis, and it resulted in a agreement called the Matinure Accords,
*15:46.460- 15:51.140* :  in the 1990s and another crisis, which ended up in the Numea Accords.
*15:51.420- 15:55.000* :  And it's the end of that 20 years on, which is where we're at now,
*15:55.500- 15:59.840* :  because those accords back in the late 90s stipulated these referendums,
*15:59.840- 16:05.000* :  which would, in theory, settle once and for all the question of whether or not the territory would go for independence.
*16:05.000- 16:09.700* :  And those referendums, very famously over the last few years, have all been no, we don't want independence.
*16:10.120- 16:14.660* :  But, you know, it still doesn't settle it, because, you know, there is still tension,
*16:14.740- 16:19.000* :  and there is still feeling now among the pro-independence crowd in New Caledonia
*16:19.000- 16:21.820* :  that the government in France has said, right, OK, no independence fine,
*16:21.820- 16:25.220* :  now we'll do what we want to do, and that's angered people out there.
*16:25.700- 16:30.480* :  So, President Macron has said these voting reforms have been delayed, not scrapped,
*16:30.700- 16:33.340* :  so this is a case of kicking the can down the road.
*16:33.840- 16:40.780* :  Well, it's certainly the case that these controversial changes to the electoral law in New Caledonia,
*16:40.780- 16:44.720* :  which would have meant more non-canak people having a chance to vote,
*16:44.780- 16:48.500* :  because there are a lot of people who, you know, in France or anywhere else in the West,
*16:48.500- 16:50.120* :  well, they would be voting, but they can't vote.
*16:50.500- 16:52.920* :  You know, there are people who are born maybe in New Caledonia,
*16:53.360- 16:56.400* :  or who have lived there for, you know, many, many years, who can't vote,
*16:56.560- 17:00.540* :  because under the existing arrangements, you know, only certain people who can vote,
*17:00.560- 17:02.700* :  you had to have a certain criteria before you could vote.
*17:02.700- 17:04.840* :  And that means a lot of people are excluded from the vote.
*17:05.140- 17:09.560* :  And so, in a way, it's a perfect democratic advance to give these people the vote.
*17:09.560- 17:13.940* :  And of course, by giving them the vote, that increases the size of the population who are non-canak,
*17:13.940- 17:17.640* :  and that is this explosive cause at the centre of it all.
*17:17.880- 17:19.760* :  The thing is, it's not going to be resolved quickly.
*17:19.760- 17:25.800* :  And I think what a lot of people are saying is that Macron, with typical sort of a law and verve,
*17:25.800- 17:29.240* :  but also unpredictable sort of overconfidence,
*17:29.680- 17:34.680* :  thinks that it's just a question of sort of everyone knocking heads together for a month under his orders,
*17:34.920- 17:36.400* :  and this will all be sorted out.
*17:36.400- 17:38.940* :  But why is it heads, I would say, here in Paris, to say, look,
*17:39.280- 17:41.400* :  this is something that works its way out in decades.
*17:41.400- 17:46.040* :  We're now at the end of the phase, initiated in the late 90s.
*17:46.420- 17:54.960* :  We need another 20-year kind of settlement to allow this to move kind of slowly towards some ultimate arrangement.
*17:55.000- 17:57.600* :  But you shouldn't rush this, is what there's any to Macron.
*17:58.320- 17:58.960* :  Huescofield.
*17:59.980- 18:07.620* :  Germany's far-right alternative for Germany party, the AFD, has been expelled from its group in the European Parliament
*18:08.080- 18:10.320* :  by other right-wing populist parties.
*18:10.780- 18:17.900* :  The move was sparked by a number of scandals involving the AFD's lead candidate in the European Parliament elections in two weeks' time.
*18:17.900- 18:25.320* :  Maximilian Krah, including most recently appearing to play down the crimes of Adolf Hitler's SS,
*18:26.080- 18:30.660* :  originally a paramilitary organisation that provided security for the Nazi party.
*18:31.200- 18:32.740* :  Demi McGinnitz reports from Berlin.
*18:33.340- 18:37.760* :  Germany's far-right AFD party has, it seems, become too extreme,
*18:37.760- 18:40.700* :  even for other European right-wing radicals.
*18:41.200- 18:48.100* :  It was Italian right-wing populists that requested to expel the AFD from their European Parliamentary group.
*18:48.640- 18:54.820* :  And earlier this week, French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said it was time to cut ties with the AFD.
*18:55.240- 18:58.340* :  She said the party had repeatedly overstepped red lines.
*18:58.340- 19:05.980* :  The party's lead candidate, Maximilian Krah, told journalists that not everyone in Hitler's SS was a criminal.
*19:05.980- 19:10.940* :  It was already accused of links to China and alleged payments from Russia.
*19:11.740- 19:18.780* :  For months, the AFD has been plagued by scandal, including numerous court cases and allegations of ties to the Kremlin.
*19:19.580- 19:29.040* :  With European Parliamentary elections in two weeks, other parties don't want to be tainted by an increasingly extreme and potentially toxic AFD.
*19:29.780- 19:33.080* :  In Germany, the party has dropped in the polls to around 15%,
*19:33.560- 19:36.640* :  but these rouse are unlikely to hurt the party much more.
*19:37.200- 19:40.580* :  Many court supporters here agree with Mr Krah's comments.
*19:40.580- 19:47.340* :  And outrage in the media can play into the AFD's narrative that the party is being targeted unfairly.
*19:47.920- 19:49.460* :  Damon McGinnitz in Germany.
*19:50.600- 19:57.900* :  The European Space Agency says its Euclid telescope has sent back the largest images of the universe ever taken from space.
*19:57.900- 20:02.380* :  They capture vast new areas of the sky in unprecedented detail.
*20:03.100- 20:10.700* :  James McGinnitz heard more from Dr. Valeria Petorino, the Euclid project scientist at the European Space Agency based in the Netherlands,
*20:11.260- 20:12.820* :  but who is currently in Spain.
*20:12.820- 20:17.280* :  So what do these new images show us and what is special about this telescope?
*20:17.960- 20:21.360* :  Euclid is incredible. It can go fast and wide.
*20:21.800- 20:28.320* :  It is designed to have a very large field of view, which allows to grasp thousands of sources in one single shot.
*20:28.320- 20:37.660* :  It covers about 10 square degrees per day, and this allows Euclid to mop the entire extra galactic sky and in the future six years.
*20:38.200- 20:45.460* :  Now, in these new images that we have just released, we see the result of 24 hours of observations.
*20:46.340- 20:50.140* :  So apart from being visually beautiful, they're really extremely informative.
*20:50.860- 20:51.880* :  What are you looking for?
*20:52.100- 20:59.580* :  Well, you can zoom in and zoom in and still seeing great detailed thousands of objects, several new objects with very low surface brightness,
*20:59.580- 21:01.620* :  which had never been observed before.
*21:02.240- 21:06.960* :  We see entire galaxy clusters, but also small planets up to four times the mass of Jupiter.
*21:06.960- 21:14.320* :  We see regions where new stars are forming and we see arcs where the light is distorted under the effect of gravity.
*21:14.620- 21:22.480* :  Tell us about the dark universe, dark energy and dark matter. Remind us what they are and how will Euclid help you study those?
*21:22.820- 21:29.240* :  Yes, Euclid is meant to address fundamental questions in cosmology. What is the nature of the arc energy? What is the nature of dark matter?
*21:29.840- 21:32.600* :  Why is the universe expanding faster and faster?
*21:32.640- 21:41.580* :  And it will do so by observing 1.5 billion images of galaxies and the distance of at least 30 millions among them.
*21:41.720- 21:48.080* :  The light that we see distorted, also in these images, is distorted because of the presence of dark matter.
*21:48.780- 21:55.320* :  We see intra-cluster light also between galaxies, stars which are ripped away from the current galaxy,
*21:55.860- 21:59.400* :  and this can also be used to trace where dark matter is.
*21:59.640- 22:03.220* :  And what is it? What's it going to tell you?
*22:03.580- 22:12.540* :  Well, there are many theoretical models that can describe that. It could be particles, it could be gravitational forces that act differently at very, very large scales.
*22:13.220- 22:17.920* :  And this is the objective of Euclid for the next six years of observations.
*22:18.700- 22:27.280* :  So what we are showing today is 24 hours. So imagine in six years we are going to collect an immense database of objects that will be made available
*22:27.280- 22:33.980* :  and will be studied also by future generations to access really the most fundamental questions about the universe we live in.
*22:34.560- 22:39.020* :  Dr. Valeria Petorino. Still to come.
*22:39.360- 22:44.800* :  Carlo Acoutis has fulfilled all of the requirements. He was just 15 when he died.
*22:47.780- 22:56.240* :  An Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 is said to become the first Roman Catholic saint of the millennial generation.
*23:04.080- 23:08.760* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*23:09.060- 23:11.420* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*23:11.760- 23:19.100* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*23:19.440- 23:24.440* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*23:24.440- 23:27.240* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.

*24:11.380- 24:12.700* :  This is the Global News Podcast.
*24:12.700- 24:21.800* :  To Iran, next, where the funeral has taken place for the country's president, Ibrahim Rehissi, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday.
*24:21.800- 24:29.440* :  He died alongside the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdallah Hien, and six others near the border with Azerbaijan.
*24:30.260- 24:39.180* :  Thousands of people took to the streets of Mahshad, Iran's second city for the culmination of three days of mourning for the Hardline Clerics death.
*24:39.840- 24:42.460* :  Our diplomatic correspondent, Caroline Hawley, has more.
*24:57.880- 25:07.280* :  There were prayers and huge crowds of tightly packed mourners in the streets of Mahshad, most dressed in black, some through flowers at the late president's coffin as it passed.
*25:07.280- 25:13.240* :  For the Islamic Republic and its loyalists, this is the culmination of several days of official mourning.
*25:14.140- 25:23.380* :  But millions of other Iranians will remember Ibrahim Rehissi for his role in crushing protests, including an uprising led by women and girls in 2022.
*25:24.400- 25:26.720* :  Now, attention will shift to who replaces him.
*25:27.060- 25:31.440* :  Carefully controlled elections are due to be held next month to decide his successor.
*25:32.080- 25:36.060* :  It comes as the divide between Iran's rulers and its people has been deepening.
*25:36.760- 25:40.900* :  Many Iranians would, if they could, replace the entire clerical establishment.
*25:41.700- 25:42.480* :  Caroline Hawley.
*25:43.340- 25:49.580* :  In the UK, Thursday was the first full day of campaigning after a snap election was announced the day before.
*25:49.580- 25:52.260* :  Voting will take place in six weeks' time.
*25:52.780- 26:00.560* :  The British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and the main opposition leader, Keir Starmer, have been canvassing and attending rallies across the country.
*26:00.560- 26:14.500* :  The latter, with a significant lead in opinion polls, immigration was a hot topic with the Prime Minister defending his Rwanda scheme to send some asylum seekers there and the fact that it won't be up and running before the election.
*26:15.260- 26:17.320* :  The flights will go in July and that's the choice at this election.
*26:17.320- 26:24.780* :  If you believe in stopping the boats, yes, if you believe in stopping the boats, if you believe in an election before you can demonstrate that your plan has worked.
*26:24.780- 26:26.600* :  No, we've put the preparations in place.
*26:26.980- 26:30.400* :  It's a policy, Keir Starmer, takes a very different stance on.
*26:30.760- 26:42.900* :  We set out our first step to take back control of our borders, with a border security command that can smash the gangs that are running the file trade of putting people in small boats across the channel.
*26:43.560- 26:48.900* :  Just before I spoke to our political correspondent, Rob Watson, I looked at the polls on the BBC website.
*26:48.900- 26:58.160* :  It showed the opposition Labour Party at 45%, and the governing Conservative Party at 23%. So what did Rob think of that?
*26:58.860- 27:08.660* :  It's worth just noting, Nick, that no party has ever won an election when on the day the election was called, it was 10 percentage points or more behind.
*27:08.780- 27:15.960* :  So Rishi Sunak is really up against it. How is he going to try and do it? Well, you know, you've often heard me say there are only three kinds of elections.
*27:16.520- 27:20.020* :  We're on the right track. Better the devil, you know, or time for a change.
*27:20.020- 27:28.080* :  And Rishi Sunak is opting for a combination of one and two, sort of saying, look, we've got better figures on inflation, on economic growth.
*27:28.660- 27:33.700* :  But also, number two, better the devil, you know, you really wouldn't want to trust the main opposition Labour Party.
*27:33.700- 27:40.040* :  Now, could it work? Well, as I just said a second ago, I mean, no party has ever turned around a deficit like that.
*27:40.040- 27:48.900* :  And also, you want to bear in mind that sort of broader polling and attitude surveys in this country suggest that people are just utterly fed up with the state of the country.
*27:48.900- 27:51.460* :  So all of that counts against his mission.
*27:51.800- 27:58.980* :  Meanwhile, Keir Starmer chose your option three change again. He was doing the rounds pushing that message, wasn't he?
*27:59.040- 28:02.480* :  He was and my goodness. I mean, he couldn't make it much simpler.
*28:02.480- 28:11.480* :  I mean, it's written on all the slogans on the buses. He said, I lost count of how many times he said it yesterday in his opening remarks of the campaign.
*28:11.480- 28:17.640* :  I mean, of course, given what I was saying about the sort of the general sense in this country, a sense of malaise, you know,
*28:17.640- 28:28.980* :  it would seem that change is a pretty smart pitch, but of course, in the course of a long election, Mr Starmer and Labour are going to be asked, well, yeah, you've been talking about change, changing exactly what way and how?
*28:29.380- 28:37.560* :  A couple of casualties already. Some key policies are probably, as we heard, the Rwanda policy, probably not going to be up and running by the time the election happens.
*28:37.800- 28:44.780* :  No, not up and running, but Mr Sunack still wants us at a dividing line with Labour saying, look, you know, if you re-elect me, there will be flights to Rwanda,
*28:44.780- 28:52.420* :  but again, as on so many other things, the public are very skeptical about either party, either man doing much about migration and immigration.
*28:52.420- 29:01.200* :  Rob Watson. The Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff in Russia has been arrested on suspicion of taking bribes.
*29:01.620- 29:09.000* :  Lieutenant General Vadim Shammarin is the fourth senior Russian military figure, detained for alleged corruption in the past month.
*29:09.580- 29:17.500* :  He's appeared in court, but it's unclear how he pleaded. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg considers what the Kremlin is trying to achieve.
*29:18.000- 29:27.840* :  When one top military official in Russia is arrested, that's interesting, but when four senior defense figures are handcuffed in less than a month, that's a purge.
*29:28.000- 29:36.480* :  The latest senior military man to be locked up, accused of bribery, is Lieutenant General Vadim Shammarin, Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff.
*29:36.480- 29:45.540* :  The recent roll call of Russian defense figures, detained on corruption charges, includes a deputy defense minister and head of the minister's personnel directorate.
*29:45.780- 30:02.180* :  But why now? When Russia seems to be doing better on the battlefield in Ukraine. A year ago, when Wagner paramilitary chief Evgeny Pregoshen openly accused the army's top brass of incompetence and corruption and demanded heads roll, the Kremlin did nothing to roll them.
*30:02.360- 30:21.400* :  It sided with the country's military leadership and Pregoshen. He ended up dying in a plane crash. But now, the string of high-profile arrests and the recent appointment of a new defense minister and economist suggests that the Kremlin recognizes the need to boost efficiency in the Russian military and tackle corruption.
*30:21.400- 30:34.660* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow, and since Steve filed that report, another defense official, Vladimir Veteletsky, an officer in charge of state defense purchases, has been arrested for abuse of power.
*30:35.020- 30:38.960* :  It's reported he's accused of awarding state contracts to associates.
*30:40.540- 30:57.680* :  An Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 is set to become the first Roman Catholic saint of the millennial generation. The Vatican has attributed two miracles to Carlo Acutis after prayers were made at his tomb in a CC in Umbria.
*30:57.680- 31:06.440* :  He was born in 1991, and during his life, his tech savvy skills earned him the nickname God's Influencer, Nikki Cardwell reports.
*31:06.440- 31:27.280* :  Only the Pope decides who becomes a saint, but Carlo Acutis has fulfilled all of the requirements. He was born in London, but grew up in Milan, where his passion for computers and promoting Catholicism online resulted in his taking care of the websites for his parish church and a Vatican academy. He was just 15 when he died.
*31:27.280- 31:37.220* :  In 2020, he was beatified, the first step towards St. Hood, with the service streamed live on the internet.
*31:42.740- 31:55.400* :  After the Vatican recognized his first miracle, curing a birth defect in a four-year-old boy. Today, a second was approved, the miraculous recovery of a 21-year-old woman with a serious head injury.
*31:55.400- 32:02.400* :  His mother, Antonio Salzano, told a church in the US that stories such as this were not unusual.
*32:02.700- 32:14.780* :  It's doing all over the world a lot of miracles. Today, we receive an information about the possible miracle healings, conversion, because Carlo has a lot of the votes all over the world.
*32:14.800- 32:29.600* :  One of his friends has talked about how strange it is, having a friend about to become a saint. I knew he was different from others he said, but now I realise just how special he was. Carlo Acutis is expected to be formally made a saint next year.
*32:30.220- 32:31.000* :  Nikki Cardwell.
*32:32.400- 32:40.120* :  Do you have one of those names that computers don't like? Names that get autocorrected, often to something ridiculous.
*32:41.060- 32:52.760* :  Take Savan Chardonnay Ganesha, a British Indian content creator whose name Savan, which means monsoon, moonlight, often gets changed to Satan.
*32:52.960- 33:02.320* :  Well, now a campaign based in the UK called, I am not a typo, has sent an open letter to big tech companies, pushing them to change their systems to be more inclusive.
*33:02.940- 33:13.720* :  Roger Hearing spoke to Karl Wogan, who's with the campaign, and began by suggesting to him that this isn't really a problem. You just changed the name back to the correct version if the computer suggests the other way.
*33:14.520- 33:29.000* :  That's often the first reaction we get, Roger, and I think that probably in itself reveals often a lot of our own biases or our own assumptions about how important other people's ethnicities or backgrounds are to them.
*33:29.000- 33:41.200* :  And for a lot of people, they would suggest, look, it's only a little red swivel under your name or in my case, it's only my phone wishing me to be more Catholic or wishing for me to be a cathedral instead of the couple that I am.
*33:41.560- 33:49.800* :  But actually, you know, in the vast majority of time, I can laugh it off, but sometimes it does remind me that I'm a little different and I'm an Irishman who lives in London.
*33:49.800- 34:12.740* :  I'm probably not the most other person in the world. It's quite an easy existence. But for a lot of people, it is a reminder of harsher realities and this issue of auto crept and spell check really represents bigger issues of discrimination or othering in society or at the very least a lack of inclusivity, a lack of appreciation that they exist and that their backgrounds and their cities exist.
*34:13.220- 34:20.860* :  And indeed, the origins of their names may be invalid, which my computer or my phone telling me that, I don't know, I think it feels rude.
*34:21.400- 34:28.860* :  Yeah, and I suppose there's also in people, you know, sometimes don't auto correct them. They don't notice maybe that it's changed them and that I guess could cause embarrassment.
*34:29.220- 34:37.460* :  Absolutely. Like if you're a conscientious person, I'm sure you are Roger and you're texting a friend of yours or emailing a friend of yours and you're inviting them around for dinner.
*34:37.940- 34:47.520* :  And your phone makes you make the mistake you perfectly know how to spell their name and how to address them, but your phone enforces this sort of culturally normative error on you.
*34:47.780- 35:00.620* :  That can make you act to feel really bad and it's interesting the stories that we get are not just from people who are directly affected by this issue, but we've had hundreds of stories of people who are like, I don't want my phone to enforce this rudeness on me.
*35:00.620- 35:08.380* :  My mistakes should be my own. I shouldn't have to also be represented by the mistakes of this technology or the lack of inclusivity of this technology.
*35:08.820- 35:21.300* :  Luckily, I would suggest and this is one of the messages that the I'm not a type of campaign. This issue shouldn't be challenging to fix. If you're Microsoft, I should or to think that you don't know your way around and excel spreadsheet, you literally invented them.
*35:21.760- 35:34.160* :  Every year countries around the world, including in the UK and the North American, Australia are publishing spreadsheets that say these are the numbers of children born every year with X, Y and Z names.
*35:34.220- 35:43.080* :  It should be really easy for these companies to actually see these lists and make sure that their technology is actually refractive of the societies in which they function.
*35:43.260- 35:47.860* :  Have you guys had any response and we've let Microsoft drabler. Have they taken this on board in any way?
*35:48.060- 35:58.540* :  We've had probably two types of response from big tech companies. One is a lot more secretive or I would say a lot more casual and it's people who work there because this campaign has been seen by a lot of people.
*35:58.820- 36:08.080* :  People who work at these companies who aren't necessarily big decision makers who have seen and really innocently and earnestly said, that's a really cool campaign that represents something to me.
*36:08.320- 36:19.480* :  I hope that this can change it and then we say back to them, is there any way you can help us make a connection because I don't have I don't have the phone number for the CEOs of Microsoft or the CEOs of Apple.
*36:20.000- 36:31.520* :  But slowly but surely I think we're trying to make this connection. I think we're getting some traction. But what it does require is just some humility from these companies to say, you know what fair play you've exposed an issue.
*36:31.520- 36:36.860* :  We'd love to we'd love to either work with you on fixing the ship or just fix ourselves. That's all we're doing.
*36:43.580- 36:52.240* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
