*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:34.580- 00:38.380* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:40.740- 00:46.200* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 30 Nrs GMT on Friday, May the 3rd, these are our main stories.
*00:46.200- 00:52.220* :  The UN says the battle for the city of Alphasia in Darfur in the west of Sudan is proving
*00:52.220- 00:58.620* :  catastrophic for people struggling to survive there. China hopes a spacecraft it's launched today
*00:58.620- 01:02.840* :  will bring back samples that will shed light on the far side of the moon.
*01:03.540- 01:08.300* :  In Brazil, severe flooding causes chaos across the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
*01:10.840- 01:13.980* :  Also in this podcast, why Turkey is banning trade with Israel,
*01:14.560- 01:19.420* :  echoes from the days of protests against America's war in Vietnam and
*01:25.480- 01:28.900* :  why Papi Yoga will become a thing of the past in Italy.
*01:32.860- 01:37.480* :  We start in Sudan where the year-long civil war between the army and the paramilitary
*01:37.480- 01:42.200* :  rapid support forces is now focusing on the city of Alphasia in North Darfur,
*01:42.600- 01:48.120* :  the last city in the region still under army control. The UN has repeatedly warned of devastating
*01:48.120- 01:52.640* :  consequences as millions of people across the country have been forced to flee their homes.
*01:53.300- 01:58.040* :  Both sides in the conflict have been accused of brutal abuses of the civilian population.
*01:58.840- 02:05.180* :  Toby Harvard is the UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan. He was in Alphasia himself
*02:05.180- 02:10.060* :  just 10 days ago and he's been telling James Coppnell what he found there.
*02:10.520- 02:15.840* :  The situation in Alphasia and in the immediate areas or rural areas around it is catastrophic.
*02:15.840- 02:22.100* :  What we've seen in recent days is a significant increase in a fleet lack of rule of law,
*02:22.100- 02:27.440* :  arbitrary killings. We've seen theft of livestock. We've seen complete burning of entire villages.
*02:28.160- 02:33.820* :  We've seen a big escalation in airstrikes and the tightening siege of the city,
*02:33.820- 02:40.920* :  which has basically stopped all humanitarian aid getting in and has choked off commercial trade.
*02:41.000- 02:46.580* :  We're also seeing convergence of militias coming around the city which has massively
*02:46.580- 02:55.680* :  metastasized insecurity across a belt of localities to the south and to the east and to the west
*02:55.680- 03:00.640* :  of Alphasia, which has started to make it very, very difficult for people wanting to
*03:00.640- 03:05.580* :  flee the city to actually get out safely. To put names to some of the accusations,
*03:05.740- 03:11.600* :  is it largely the RSF and Allied militias burning villages and then the Sudanese Armed Forces
*03:12.260- 03:16.640* :  carrying out aerial bombardments? Is that the pattern? Yeah, I'm a humanitarian. I don't want to get
*03:16.640- 03:22.780* :  into naming names, but absolutely. It's certainly it's the case of Arab militias who have been
*03:22.780- 03:29.060* :  burning villages. Sometimes this is as a result of provocations from the other side and obviously
*03:29.060- 03:33.480* :  it is the Sudanese Armed Forces that have the Air Force and they are taking action against
*03:34.480- 03:40.480* :  RSF-controlled areas. You mentioned how difficult it is for civilians right now.
*03:40.480- 03:48.520* :  What options do they have? Is flight a possibility? There are a few corridors left. As I mentioned,
*03:48.520- 03:54.240* :  there are many of the corridors that the land corridors are blocked because of rising insecurity
*03:54.240- 04:00.740* :  and the converging of forces. But there are, we have some national staff who were able to
*04:00.740- 04:06.320* :  flee a couple of days ago, but certainly the options for people to get out are very limited and
*04:06.320- 04:13.800* :  people simply don't have the money to buy tickets on transport. I mean, the cost of fuel amongst
*04:13.800- 04:19.240* :  other very basic products has soared recently because of the siege on the city. To what extent
*04:19.240- 04:27.240* :  are the United Nations and aid agencies able to help out given the security situation that you
*04:27.240- 04:33.600* :  describe? Well, we have in place two corridors, aid corridors, one from Port Sudan which takes a
*04:33.600- 04:38.980* :  northern route across the River Nile down into Elfasha and we have a second route from Tina on the
*04:38.980- 04:44.500* :  border with Chad. We've had some success in getting assistance through. Obviously the military
*04:44.500- 04:51.240* :  activity to the north of Elfasha put a serious stop to those routes, but we've had I think it's
*04:51.240- 04:58.220* :  95 trucks that have got into Darfur over the last six weeks. Now, this is a drop in the ocean
*04:58.220- 05:05.040* :  to what is needed given the fact that we have well over one million people on the brink of famine.
*05:05.540- 05:09.720* :  The UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Toby Harvard.
*05:10.940- 05:15.940* :  Turkey says its suspension of trade with Israel over the country's offensive in Gaza will remain
*05:15.940- 05:21.300* :  until a permanent ceasefire is established because of the worsening humanitarian situation in
*05:21.300- 05:26.680* :  the Palestinian territory. The Turkish trade ministry said all imports and exports would stop
*05:26.680- 05:32.060* :  until the Israeli government allowed an uninterrupted and sufficient flow of aid into Gaza.
*05:32.660- 05:36.380* :  Earlier, the Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Turkey's president,
*05:36.380- 05:41.760* :  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of behaving like a dictator. Our senior international correspondent,
*05:41.760- 05:47.140* :  Oleg Erin, is in Istanbul, asked her about the nature of trade between the two countries.
*05:47.800- 05:54.360* :  Significantly for Israel, about a third of its cement comes from Turkey. That's according to
*05:54.360- 06:00.760* :  information we've had from construction industry sources in Israel. And they also say that about 70
*06:00.760- 06:06.720* :  percent of the iron used in construction is coming from Turkey. So that is a significant relationship.
*06:07.420- 06:13.120* :  Now, the trade ministry has been blaming what it called a massacre taking place in Gaza over
*06:13.120- 06:19.120* :  the last seven months, saying that this ban would remain in place until there is unfettered and
*06:19.120- 06:26.260* :  sufficient aid going into Gaza. But there has been an escalation of rhetoric in recent months since
*06:26.260- 06:32.240* :  the war in Gaza began. Until now, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has basically been carrying out a
*06:32.240- 06:38.700* :  war of words. He has accused Israel of carrying out a genocide. He has compared the Israeli leader
*06:38.700- 06:46.000* :  to Hitler. He refers to Hamas as a liberation movement. So this diplomatic war had been going on.
*06:46.040- 06:52.360* :  But now he has taken a very big step, the kind of big step that the Turkish leader likes to take.
*06:52.360- 06:58.260* :  He is somebody who positions himself as a defender of Muslims worldwide. And that very much
*06:58.260- 07:04.460* :  includes Gaza. So he wants to land a diplomatic blow on Israel. He wants to increase Israel's
*07:04.460- 07:10.380* :  isolation. But we also have to look at the domestic political context here. The Turkish leader
*07:10.380- 07:15.600* :  has just had a very bruising outcome in local elections where his party was defeated across the
*07:15.600- 07:21.480* :  country. There is overwhelming support here for the Palestinian cause. And I think he has been
*07:21.480- 07:27.280* :  feeling the pressure from the public this push to do something more than simply conduct this
*07:27.280- 07:32.540* :  war of words and actually take concrete action which he has now done. Orleguerin in Istanbul.
*07:33.720- 07:38.440* :  Just once in a while, if you're lucky to live long enough, an echo from the lived past comes
*07:38.440- 07:44.240* :  back to Hanchu. That's the case for some older Americans today, as they witness the spate of
*07:44.240- 07:50.100* :  passionate student protests against Israel's war in Gaza taking place on college campuses across
*07:50.100- 07:55.700* :  their country. While President Joe Biden stresses the need to, as he says, uphold the rule of law
*07:55.700- 08:01.240* :  for some Americans, the protests evoke memories of other anti-war demonstrations, in particular
*08:01.240- 08:07.720* :  against the war in Vietnam in the late 1960s. Stefan Bradley is professor of black studies and
*08:07.720- 08:14.300* :  history at Amherst College in Massachusetts. He's also written about past protests. So does he
*08:14.300- 08:22.520* :  see any echoes of those times in these latest demonstrations? When I think of the 1968 rebellion
*08:22.520- 08:29.320* :  at Columbia University, I see many similarities. For instance, this idea that young people don't want
*08:29.320- 08:36.740* :  their university to be associated with death or destruction. These students at Columbia or a
*08:36.740- 08:41.980* :  UCLA or Dartmouth or anywhere want to know that the money they're spending is not being used
*08:41.980- 08:48.500* :  to harm people but rather to uplift people. So I think that's a major similarity between
*08:48.500- 08:55.220* :  now and then. I think there's an overarching goal of their institutions divesting of funds
*08:55.220- 09:01.520* :  that are being used in companies with Israel. One thing that's always important to remember is
*09:01.920- 09:07.200* :  nobody likes to be annoyed or disrupted and so people will always say there's a better way to
*09:07.200- 09:12.780* :  protest and there's a better way to demonstrate. One thing I have realized in studying all these
*09:12.780- 09:17.480* :  years is there is no right or wrong way to protest the deaths of so many people.
*09:17.480- 09:24.300* :  What you seem to have is a contest between two major opponents. One is donors, a minority of donors
*09:25.000- 09:32.040* :  and the second is students paying tuition and so the contest will be decided between those two
*09:32.220- 09:38.780* :  and in the middle you have university leadership which I think is not performing optimally right now.
*09:39.600- 09:45.440* :  Professor Stefan Bradley. A ship is preparing to set sail from France to lay the next section of
*09:45.440- 09:52.360* :  the largest ever subsea internet cable. The two Africa cable is an incredible 45,000 kilometers long
*09:52.360- 09:57.860* :  and stretches around the entire continent. But even as the world celebrates ambitious projects
*09:57.860- 10:03.600* :  like this one which gets more people online, internet freedom is under threat across the world.
*10:03.600- 10:09.960* :  This report from our cyber correspondent to a tidy. After many years of planning and investment
*10:09.960- 10:15.060* :  and then constructing the cable, laying it down the coast of Africa finally we see it come to
*10:15.060- 10:20.760* :  shore here in South Africa. The promo video is triumphant but these engineers do have a lot to
*10:20.760- 10:28.660* :  celebrate the latest successful landing of the largest subsea internet cable ever. Videos show
*10:28.660- 10:34.500* :  engineers bringing the cable ashore from a ship, carefully dragging on golden boys that are attached
*10:34.500- 10:41.260* :  to the wire. These landings have been happening since 2022 and the full 45,000 kilometers long line
*10:41.260- 10:47.520* :  won't be fully installed until next year. The two Africa project promises to bring a huge boost
*10:47.540- 10:52.160* :  in internet capacity and resilience to billions of people in Africa and beyond.
*10:56.160- 11:01.480* :  In Calais France a team is preparing to set sail to lay the next section of the line.
*11:02.440- 11:08.880* :  Inside the belly of this huge ship they carefully coil the white plastic wire around giant drums.
*11:08.940- 11:16.540* :  The cable is surprisingly thin about the same width as a garden hose and inside protected by
*11:16.540- 11:23.240* :  that plastic coating there's all these really thin optical fibers and it's on these that your emails
*11:23.240- 11:27.640* :  and social media posts travel under the oceans around the world at the speed of light.
*11:28.960- 11:32.840* :  It's subsea cables like these that have helped get the world connected in recent years.
*11:33.860- 11:40.280* :  70% of us are now online but it's expensive and high-stakes stuff a lot can go wrong with subsea
*11:40.280- 11:46.460* :  cables breakages are common but thanks to a sophisticated system of rerouting most of the time
*11:46.460- 11:51.720* :  we don't really notice. However the bigger threat to internet connectivity comes from governments
*11:51.720- 12:00.200* :  themselves. Organizations like top 10 VPN track deliberate internet shutdowns. Last year researchers say
*12:00.200- 12:05.600* :  was the worst on record with countries particularly India routinely switching off connectivity
*12:05.600- 12:11.780* :  for everything from preventing cheating in exams to controlling unrest. Marwa Fatafter is from
*12:11.780- 12:17.900* :  connectivity watches access now. Internet shutdowns is like this blanket censorship you are
*12:17.900- 12:23.700* :  controlling and stopping information flows for an entire population or community which in some
*12:23.700- 12:29.200* :  context like this in situations of armed conflict or war it can be fatal you know they're all
*12:29.200- 12:34.640* :  sorts of economic social civil and political rights that are severely impacted.
*12:37.360- 12:42.480* :  Lives online are also being controlled in a less obvious way. Researchers at Freedom House say
*12:42.480- 12:48.280* :  censorship surveillance and website blockings are on the rise. Internet freedom has declined for
*12:48.280- 12:54.060* :  13 years in a row they say with Iran and Myanmar declining the most in recent years and China
*12:54.060- 13:00.080* :  remaining the worst online environment. Experts like Jackie Kerr senior research fellow at the
*13:00.080- 13:05.080* :  national defense university say the trend is only in one direction because tools for internet
*13:05.080- 13:09.260* :  control have become abundant and governments are less squeamish about using them.
*13:10.000- 13:17.080* :  The idea that the internet is a global space that is a commons that is or you know it's public good
*13:17.080- 13:22.900* :  or commons or some combination that's going to be beyond the reach of governments to control it's
*13:22.900- 13:29.620* :  going to be the same everywhere you know that was always a bit of a fantasy but it also was sort of
*13:29.620- 13:35.480* :  this knee jerk libertarianism that was based on a incorrect understanding of how the technology
*13:35.480- 13:43.280* :  actually works. So even as incredible feats of engineering like to Africa are helping to connect us
*13:43.720- 13:47.100* :  the internet is more splintered and fractured than ever before.
*13:49.080- 13:54.580* :  Jot Heidi well let's follow that look at how the internet is getting closer to and bigger
*13:54.580- 14:00.620* :  four millions of Africans with a sideways shift to see how the words we use in everyday life
*14:00.960- 14:06.200* :  are increasingly influenced by the technology that were steeped in none more so than the internet.
*14:06.220- 14:11.180* :  We know that a lot of our listeners use the global news podcast to improve their English
*14:11.720- 14:15.840* :  and we wanted to examine some of the more popular words and expressions doing the rounds.
*14:16.360- 14:20.960* :  Nick Miles spoke to Neil Egele from the BBC podcast six minutes English.
*14:21.620- 14:26.040* :  We have these expressions that seem to come out of nowhere and often they do have quite a
*14:26.040- 14:32.900* :  history to them. Obviously viral is connected to viruses and health and those kind of concerns but
*14:33.620- 14:38.420* :  it's usage as we're talking about it now does actually go back into the late 20th century
*14:39.180- 14:43.540* :  when it came to be applied more to sort of ideas and things so we have that sort of concept
*14:43.540- 14:48.780* :  of viral marketing that type of thing where companies attempt to manufacture word of mouth
*14:48.780- 14:55.620* :  popularity but now in the social media context where we hear it most now it's still connected to
*14:55.620- 15:02.180* :  that sort of disease type idea where something's unstoppable and uncontrollable but the interesting
*15:02.180- 15:07.280* :  thing here is that it's in a positive way usually. I don't like it as a journalist because it's not
*15:07.280- 15:12.880* :  very specific yeah maybe from a learning English perspective it's not great either because it's
*15:12.880- 15:19.420* :  a bit vague. Well from a language perspective it's just exciting because it shows that things take
*15:19.420- 15:24.560* :  on new meanings and we've got no control of them a little bit like the concept of going viral this
*15:24.560- 15:30.820* :  expression now means what it means regardless of whether we like it or not. What about if we look
*15:30.820- 15:37.960* :  beyond this a wider trend on new concepts how do we tend to talk about those? For example you will
*15:37.960- 15:44.800* :  be aware of the expression to become a thing meaning that it's become widely accepted or an
*15:45.220- 15:50.660* :  acknowledged trend or recognised phenomenon. So for example we could use this to talk about
*15:50.660- 15:56.760* :  items of fashion and then maybe looking forward into the future something like a drivelous car.
*15:56.760- 16:01.900* :  So at the moment we are aware that these drivelous cars exist but they're not really a thing yet
*16:01.900- 16:08.260* :  they're not a recognised phenomenon in everyday use. They're having a moment. They're having a
*16:08.260- 16:14.780* :  moment. Another phrase. But in the future not here yet. No that's right and interestingly we can
*16:14.780- 16:19.680* :  also question whether something is a thing and the expression that we use there is is that
*16:19.680- 16:26.200* :  even a thing and that that kind of refers to when you come across something and you're not sure whether
*16:26.200- 16:31.420* :  you're just behind the times or whether it's a phenomenon that you're just unaware of.
*16:31.620- 16:37.640* :  Another example. The word hybrid we hear a lot. Again it goes back a little bit to the 1600s
*16:37.820- 16:43.160* :  to talk about a mix of two species but it's become more widely used just to mean a sort of general
*16:43.160- 16:49.960* :  mixing. It's just a shorthand because it's very complicated and worthy to say something like
*16:49.960- 16:55.900* :  I've got a car which is part electric and part petrol. So we use the shorthand it's a hybrid
*16:56.560- 17:02.020* :  or when we're talking about new working practices especially since the pandemic we talk about hybrid
*17:02.020- 17:08.080* :  working. Now we had expressions before like flexible working but when we talk about something
*17:08.080- 17:14.140* :  being hybrid it's almost got a sort of scientific stamp of approval. It will be fascinating to know
*17:14.140- 17:18.700* :  what our listeners are on the global news podcast. Think about this. Do get in touch. We'll give you
*17:18.700- 17:23.620* :  the details again at the end of this podcast. And you can hear more from Neil by searching for
*17:23.620- 17:35.400* :  BBC Learning at six minutes English. Still to come. Power is important for this kind of people.
*17:36.140- 17:40.040* :  One African country is less than convincing return to the polls.
*17:46.640- 17:50.940* :  There's yet another sign today of the ambition of China's space programme.
*18:00.480- 18:05.800* :  The country's space agency has launched a rocket carrying a probe that will aim for the first time
*18:05.800- 18:10.660* :  to collect samples from the far side of the moon and return them successfully to earth.
*18:11.120- 18:15.560* :  In a struggling economy investment in the latest international space race by Beijing
*18:15.580- 18:20.460* :  seems undentied. Ryan Harvey is a close follower of the Chinese space programme
*18:20.860- 18:25.380* :  and Paul Henley asked him what's motivating China to get to the far side of the moon.
*18:25.940- 18:31.860* :  The point of the launch of the Chong six spacecraft this morning is for the first time to get
*18:31.860- 18:37.820* :  the rocks back from the far side of the moon. Nobody has ever done this before. And what do they
*18:37.820- 18:43.020* :  hope to gain? The far side of the moon has a quite different geology from the near side of the moon.
*18:43.020- 18:49.000* :  If we look at the near side of the moon we can see the craters. We can see the black areas which are
*18:49.000- 18:55.580* :  called Maurei or seas. They're almost absent on the far side. And most lunar experts believe
*18:55.580- 19:01.640* :  that we can learn an awful lot more about the history of the moon. Its relationship with the earth
*19:02.020- 19:06.840* :  and the origins of the solar system by getting rocks back from the far side of the moon.
*19:07.140- 19:12.060* :  China's space programme seems to have grown faster than any other countries. What does it say
*19:12.060- 19:20.880* :  about national priorities at a difficult economic time? China put forward a plan for a huge expansion
*19:20.920- 19:28.660* :  of its space programme in 2009 called the Roadmap to 2050. And I don't think anyone at the time
*19:28.660- 19:33.400* :  really believed that they would be able to do these things. The only problem about their schedule
*19:33.400- 19:39.800* :  is that they've been ticking off the dates ahead of schedule, not behind schedule. And sending
*19:39.800- 19:45.480* :  spacecraft to orbit the moon, to land on the moon, to send rovers across the moon, and now to get
*19:45.480- 19:51.200* :  rocks back from the far side have been some of the main achievements as it has undertaken so far.
*19:51.740- 19:58.220* :  And this is paving the way for two more landers later in this decade. And then China will set up
*19:58.220- 20:05.580* :  its first lunar base from the year 2030 onwards. And they've recently given us the designs and
*20:05.580- 20:10.840* :  the methods and the rockets that are going to use for the first Chinese human landing on the moon
*20:10.840- 20:16.840* :  currently scheduled for 2030. Is there a military motive to what China is trying to do? The
*20:16.840- 20:21.680* :  country wouldn't be alone if there were. Most countries do have military space programmes out
*20:21.680- 20:27.860* :  that is certainly true and China is no exception to that. However, this is a civilian space science
*20:27.860- 20:35.780* :  mission. Most of the work undertaken by China in space is civilian and non-military. For example,
*20:35.780- 20:41.780* :  there are other big achievements at the moment is the Tian Gong orbiting space station, which has
*20:41.780- 20:47.580* :  three Hang Tian Yuan, which is their word for astronauts or cosmonauts on board. And that is
*20:47.580- 20:54.060* :  carrying out entirely civilian scientific research in Earth orbit at the moment. And that's another
*20:54.060- 21:00.160* :  of China's remarkable achievements in the past couple of years. Space expert Brian Harvey speaking
*21:00.160- 21:06.220* :  there to Paul Henley. The Rilling Military Council in Myanmar has stopped issuing exit permits to
*21:06.220- 21:11.480* :  men who want to apply for work overseas. Millions of Burmese people have already left the country
*21:11.480- 21:17.280* :  to escape poverty or avoid conscription since the coup three years ago, which displaced the civilian
*21:17.280- 21:23.060* :  government led by An Sansu Qi. As at the stage a correspondent Jonathan Haid told me more about the
*21:23.920- 21:29.200* :  government saying very little. I mean, basically they've suspended the issuing of permits to all men.
*21:29.200- 21:36.040* :  They say in order to scrutinize and verify them better. Now they haven't said this is specifically
*21:36.040- 21:41.640* :  because of the conscription law, but that's the way everybody reads it. You cannot, as a Myanmar
*21:41.640- 21:46.360* :  person, go overseas to work unless you get one of these permits. Very few Burmese people have
*21:46.360- 21:51.100* :  passports. The only way they're going to be able to go and get a job overseas is through getting one
*21:51.100- 21:56.200* :  of these government permits. This is an absolutely essential lifeline for the Myanmar economy.
*21:56.200- 22:00.600* :  There are millions and millions of Burmese people working in other countries sending remissances back.
*22:00.640- 22:04.800* :  But of course the numbers have gone up trying to get out of the country, have gone up significantly
*22:04.880- 22:10.380* :  since the conscription laws announced in February. We've seen huge numbers of young men fleeing
*22:11.520- 22:17.760* :  informally in an undocumented way across the border into Thailand. We've even heard of schools
*22:17.760- 22:24.940* :  trying to get their entire senior year boys out of the country on mass to avoid conscription. Nobody
*22:24.940- 22:30.440* :  wants to be conscripted. Nobody wants to have their life put at risk for a military regime that
*22:30.440- 22:36.840* :  most of them hate. And so it's been almost impossible for the army to recruit in other ways.
*22:37.300- 22:42.400* :  And I think this is their hoping, a method that will, whether if they screen it, they can weed out
*22:42.400- 22:49.800* :  anybody between the ages of 18 and 35 and make sure that they stay put. And they are conscripting
*22:50.240- 22:54.580* :  officially at least 5,000 men every month. But there are all sorts of unofficial conscription
*22:55.220- 22:58.340* :  operations going on in remote parts of the country as well.
*22:58.640- 23:03.360* :  And what does this tell us? Do you think about the junta in Myanmar and the pressure it's under?
*23:03.620- 23:08.300* :  Well we know the pressure is high. I mean they've lost a reasonably large number of troops.
*23:09.200- 23:15.000* :  But I think the numbers who are wounded, the numbers who've deserted, the numbers who defected
*23:15.000- 23:19.160* :  to the opposition, we don't even know what those numbers are. But I think their bigger problem is
*23:19.160- 23:23.640* :  they can't recruit. It used to be relatively easy to recruit into the Myanmar Armed Forces,
*23:24.200- 23:29.440* :  but recruitment is almost impossible now. The military is fighting very, very tough battles
*23:29.440- 23:34.200* :  against many of the ethnic armies. And it has been losing. And it's been losing a lot of troops.
*23:34.680- 23:38.820* :  And so even those who might otherwise have joined the military don't want to anymore because
*23:38.820- 23:43.960* :  of the risk to their lives. But so much of the population is deeply opposed to this military
*23:43.960- 23:47.420* :  government. Of course, the last thing they want to do, they're appalled at the idea they'd have
*23:47.420- 23:52.120* :  to fight against a resistance movement that most of them support. So this is the only way I think
*23:52.120- 23:56.500* :  the military feels that they can actually try and fill the gaps that are being made in the ranks.
*23:57.140- 24:03.440* :  Jonathan Head, a hydroelectric dam has burst in southern Brazil after days of heavy rain that
*24:03.440- 24:08.140* :  triggered extensive flooding. More than 30 people are known to have been killed and many more
*24:08.140- 24:13.900* :  missing in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. But the local authorities there are warning that
*24:13.900- 24:19.800* :  number could rise with more rain forecast in the coming days. Brazil's president Luiz Enacio
*24:19.800- 24:24.760* :  Lula de Silva has visited the region, promising help from the central government. The journalist
*24:24.760- 24:29.680* :  Yuen Marshall in Sao Paulo has been following events. The problem is at the moment with these
*24:29.680- 24:35.680* :  rains is that they're not just affecting one or two concentrated pockets of the state. They're
*24:35.680- 24:40.700* :  affecting more or less around half of the state and it's an area of around the size of Germany.
*24:40.700- 24:46.740* :  So if you can imagine an area of that size being affected by rains and flooding and landslides,
*24:47.400- 24:51.540* :  there's just untold amount of damage and the amount of damage that we're going to see over the next
*24:51.540- 24:57.760* :  couple of days is worryingly going to be worse. We're expecting these heavy rains to continue
*24:57.760- 25:04.040* :  over the weekend and also we have a lot of rivers in the state which have reached all time high
*25:04.040- 25:10.720* :  levels and as those flow down these will now affect other parts of the state. They will burst
*25:10.720- 25:16.980* :  their banks at other towns that haven't been affected already. We see the mayor of Porto Alegre
*25:16.980- 25:22.980* :  which is the state capital is a city of around 1.5 million people. They're warning that on Friday
*25:22.980- 25:27.160* :  afternoon they're expecting to probably have the biggest floods that they've ever had in their
*25:27.160- 25:34.760* :  history. We've had dams, bridges, roads, all of these major infrastructure work that link these
*25:34.760- 25:40.780* :  cities together or in the case of dams that control the level of water. A lot of these have failed
*25:40.780- 25:46.780* :  and collapsed which is not only meant that it's a lot harder to get from one city to another and to
*25:46.780- 25:52.480* :  get help from one city to another. It has also caused untold destruction in the place where these
*25:52.480- 25:57.980* :  dams and bridges and roads have just given way. At the moment we're just going through the
*25:57.980- 26:04.340* :  tail end of the El Nino weather phenomenon which is really affected South America and Brazil and
*26:04.340- 26:09.580* :  with the rising temperatures in the Pacific Ocean causing all of this increased rainfall and
*26:09.580- 26:14.680* :  the climate scientists in Brazil were expecting some severe rain for this period in Brazil south
*26:15.080- 26:21.200* :  but nothing like we've seen I mean in some parts of the state of Gil Grigido so we've only had
*26:21.200- 26:28.160* :  one or two days of the month of May already and they've already tripled the average rainfall
*26:28.160- 26:34.940* :  expected for the month of May. You in Marshall in Sao Paulo. Over the past four years of vast
*26:34.940- 26:41.040* :  sway the Western and Central Africa including parts of the Sahel has been branded the Kubelt.
*26:41.380- 26:46.540* :  That's because over that time nine countries in the region have seen military strongmen seize power.
*26:47.040- 26:51.640* :  On Monday Chad will become the first of them to head to the polls in what on the face of it looks
*26:51.640- 26:57.160* :  like an attempt to restore a democratic government. Critics though suggest the current military leader
*26:57.340- 27:03.380* :  Mohamed Debi is simply using the election as a rubber stamp to transform himself into a civilian
*27:03.380- 27:08.680* :  president. Beverly O'Cheng has been speaking to Ramayade whose director of the Africa Center
*27:08.680- 27:15.040* :  at the Atlantic Council and a former French minister and ambassador. Beverly began by asking why the
*27:15.040- 27:24.260* :  current leader had gone back on his earlier promise not to run. Because power is important for
*27:24.260- 27:32.820* :  this kind of people. He has been into the power for three years now but Chad's three years of
*27:32.820- 27:39.700* :  government had one objective to keep Mohamed Debi in power in the long term obviously look the
*27:39.860- 27:46.960* :  violent oppression and intimidation of opponents for example shows that he did not want to give up
*27:46.960- 27:52.020* :  the power. And you know having been a French minister before how do you feel about the fact that
*27:52.020- 27:57.000* :  the French president in Malamakon had said that he had admiration for this electoral process.
*27:57.360- 28:02.880* :  This is the problem of France right now in the region and especially in the Sahel. This
*28:02.880- 28:13.300* :  region is now named the Ku belt. Ku belt because the region has experienced many coup d'etat
*28:13.300- 28:22.980* :  in the past months. In Niger, in Malin, in Afaso, in Guinea. Chad has never been named or called
*28:23.000- 28:31.900* :  or janta but actually there was no election after Debi's death in 2021. His son just took the
*28:31.900- 28:38.800* :  power without no election. Many many many Africans especially the use the public opinions
*28:39.440- 28:46.240* :  considered that or blamed France for this double standard because you cannot consider that what
*28:46.240- 28:53.460* :  happened in Niger is a coup. What happened in Burkina Faso is a coup condemned it even threatened
*28:54.120- 29:01.600* :  Nigerians of I mean the new janta of a military intervention and at the same time congratulate Chad
*29:02.600- 29:13.640* :  for the feminist transition and congratulate Chad for the ongoing electoral process for this
*29:13.640- 29:19.820* :  presidential election and this is something that is really really challenging for France
*29:19.820- 29:25.600* :  credibility in the region. The former French ambassador and government minister Ramayade talking to
*29:25.600- 29:32.240* :  Beverly Occeng. You may have seen it on social media rooms of Lycraclade people stretching on
*29:32.240- 29:38.740* :  exercise mats surrounded by puppies. Puppy yoga has boomed in recent years along with similar classes
*29:38.740- 29:44.680* :  involving kittens rabbits and even goats but the Italian government has dealt a blow to the
*29:44.680- 29:50.800* :  activity banning the participation of puppies because of concerns about their welfare. Isabella Jewel
*29:50.960- 30:03.140* :  has more. It's not often that when doing downward dog you meet a yapping puppy but for some people
*30:03.140- 30:10.080* :  puppies have become a cuddly accompaniment to their yoga practice. No longer it seems for Italians.
*30:10.860- 30:16.700* :  The country's Ministry of Health has banned puppy yoga, classes which involve freely roaming
*30:16.700- 30:24.060* :  animals. The trend has spread across North America and Europe in recent years popularized on social
*30:24.060- 30:29.980* :  media. Today my fiancee and I got to go to puppy yoga and yes it's just as amazing as it sounds
*30:30.220- 30:37.480* :  but perhaps it's not as cute and fluffy as it seems. The government in Rome says that from now on
*30:37.480- 30:44.120* :  only fully grown dogs can take part to protect the health of young animals and the safety of those
*30:44.120- 30:49.940* :  attending. It's a decision that has been hailed by animal protection groups in Italy who claim the
*30:49.940- 30:56.620* :  practice is exploitative and stressful for the puppies. Dog experts have warned that the creatures
*30:56.620- 31:02.960* :  are often not transported to and from classes safely and are sometimes not even given enough water.
*31:04.060- 31:09.060* :  Proponents of the classes argue that they improve the mental well-being of those taking parts
*31:09.580- 31:11.700* :  and help to socialise the young animals.
*31:16.940- 31:22.820* :  But from Milan to Messina, yoga classes will have to say shout to the puppy craze.
*31:25.980- 31:27.980* :  That tale from Isabella Joule
*31:30.820- 31:34.760* :  And that's chauh from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
