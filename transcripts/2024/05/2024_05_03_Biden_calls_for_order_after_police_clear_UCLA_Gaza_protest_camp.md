*01:24.040- 01:28.160* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Friday, the third of May, these are our main stories.
*01:28.620- 01:33.060* :  President Biden has warned pro-Palestinian demonstrators at American universities
*01:33.520- 01:35.840* :  that they don't have a right to cause chaos.
*01:36.600- 01:40.440* :  An international police operation has uncovered one of the largest networks of
*01:40.440- 01:45.520* :  fraudulent call centers in Europe responsible for thousands of scam calls a day.
*01:46.240- 01:50.240* :  French MPs have voted to set up a commission to investigate sexual abuse
*01:50.540- 01:51.420* :  in the film industry.
*01:53.440- 01:54.300* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:58.680- 01:59.240* :  the smart,
*01:59.240- 02:03.020* :  tree-dweller that's learned how to use plants to heal itself.
*02:06.600- 02:12.340* :  President Biden has said people have the right to protest but not to cause chaos.
*02:12.920- 02:17.340* :  As he addressed the violence and arrest scene at some demonstrations at US universities
*02:17.900- 02:21.560* :  about the conflict in Gaza, speaking at the White House, he said the events
*02:21.560- 02:25.420* :  had put to the test two fundamental American principles.
*02:25.420- 02:28.400* :  The right to free speech and the rule of law.
*02:28.400- 02:30.940* :  His stress both must be upheld.
*02:31.300- 02:35.180* :  Mr. Biden made the comments on Thursday, hours after police in Los Angeles,
*02:35.180- 02:41.560* :  cleared a pro-Palestinian protest camp at UCLA where demonstrators have been told to leave.
*02:42.080- 02:46.660* :  This report from our correspondent Emma Vardy, who spent the day following events at the
*02:46.660- 02:47.860* :  campus in Los Angeles.
*02:52.400- 02:54.900* :  Police in riot gear moved in before dawn.
*02:57.940- 03:01.940* :  They'd surrounded the pro-Palestinian camp at UCLA on all sides.
*03:02.920- 03:07.600* :  Despite building a makeshift fortress around them, the protesters found their barricades
*03:07.720- 03:08.620* :  soon overpowered.
*03:13.700- 03:16.480* :  Defining flashbang grenades were deployed by police.
*03:16.480- 03:22.400* :  The bright lights and loud bangs used to disorientate protesters as the police moved in to clear the
*03:22.440- 03:22.820* :  tents.
*03:23.300- 03:29.320* :  I'm just here to show support, amplify the message that the students are saying here.
*03:29.720- 03:34.420* :  It's very inspiring to see that the students are not backing down, that they are, you know,
*03:34.420- 03:38.240* :  they're putting a lot on the line, they're risking arrests, they're risking their careers,
*03:38.240- 03:42.260* :  and their futures to actually send this message and it's very important and it's very inspiring.
*03:42.640- 03:45.680* :  Demonstrators linked arms, but police lines pushed them back.
*03:46.160- 03:48.800* :  Some protesters say rubber bullets were used against them.
*03:49.140- 03:53.000* :  The country has been waiting a long time for a response from the president about the
*03:53.000- 03:54.420* :  growing protests and violence.
*03:54.420- 03:56.160* :  Joe Biden finally spoke.
*03:56.660- 04:01.380* :  Breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations.
*04:01.900- 04:06.680* :  None of this is a peaceful protest, threatening people, intimidating people,
*04:07.140- 04:09.660* :  and still inferring people is not peaceful protest.
*04:10.160- 04:11.380* :  It's against the law.
*04:12.160- 04:16.260* :  The Senate is essential to democracy, but the Senate must never lead the disorder
*04:16.260- 04:21.740* :  or to deny the rights of others so students can finish the semester and their college education.
*04:22.340- 04:27.620* :  By morning, little remained of the encampment that had occupied the main quad of UCLA for a week.
*04:28.200- 04:33.400* :  Police operations across the US have demonstrated that encampments will not be tolerated for long.
*04:34.000- 04:39.620* :  At UCLA, it's disrupted many students exam week and may still be some time before the campus
*04:40.020- 04:40.860* :  returns to normality.
*04:41.460- 04:42.040* :  Emma Vardi.
*04:42.860- 04:46.880* :  An international police operation by Europe has uncovered one of the largest
*04:46.880- 04:50.760* :  networks of fraudulent call centres across Europe and beyond.
*04:50.760- 04:56.660* :  The EU's law enforcement agency said offices in six countries were involved in the raids.
*04:57.300- 05:01.040* :  German police initially monitored calls from the centres
*05:01.040- 05:03.980* :  listening in to the multiple scams.
*05:04.040- 05:08.640* :  They said the operation has saved potential victims from losing over a hundred million dollars.
*05:09.220- 05:13.900* :  Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss told me more about the criminal network behind the scat.
*05:14.520- 05:17.580* :  The scale of this enterprise really was remarkable.
*05:17.580- 05:23.480* :  There were call centres in five countries, Germany, Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo and also Lebanon,
*05:24.200- 05:27.880* :  and they were making more than 10,000 calls every single day.
*05:27.880- 05:29.740* :  They were fake police calls.
*05:29.740- 05:34.380* :  People trying to persuade their victims to invest in fictitious investment opportunities.
*05:34.380- 05:36.620* :  There were some that promised romance.
*05:36.620- 05:39.740* :  There were some demanding that debts be repaid.
*05:39.740- 05:41.560* :  Of course, the debts were completely invented.
*05:42.600- 05:46.020* :  I think probably most of us have received these kinds of fake calls.
*05:46.020- 05:48.360* :  Many of us will know people who fell for it.
*05:48.360- 05:52.440* :  Afterwards, they often say they can't believe how gullible they were.
*05:52.440- 05:55.960* :  What the police, the investigators, are saying about these criminals,
*05:55.960- 06:02.460* :  were that they used a variety of manipulation tactics to shock and cheat their victims
*06:02.860- 06:03.640* :  out of their savings.
*06:03.640- 06:05.740* :  So Paul, how did the police catch them?
*06:05.900- 06:10.260* :  Well, it all started last December when a woman walked into a bank in Freiburg,
*06:10.260- 06:14.580* :  Southweth, Germany, and asked to withdraw 100,000 euros.
*06:14.580- 06:16.520* :  That's just over 100,000 dollars.
*06:17.220- 06:21.040* :  Perhaps not surprisingly, the teller was a bit suspicious, called the police.
*06:21.040- 06:25.320* :  The police came and talked to the woman and realized that she was the victim of a scam
*06:25.840- 06:28.280* :  and that she was about to hand the money over to someone.
*06:28.340- 06:30.680* :  The person turned up and was promptly arrested.
*06:31.520- 06:34.780* :  Now, they could have stopped there, but they then looked at the numbers that were used.
*06:34.780- 06:36.640* :  The telephone numbers to call this woman.
*06:37.040- 06:41.100* :  And they realized they could link that to a whole network of calls that were being made
*06:41.100- 06:42.400* :  in all these different countries.
*06:43.120- 06:45.720* :  And so they launched what they called Operation Pandora.
*06:45.720- 06:47.860* :  First, hundreds of German offices involved.
*06:47.860- 06:52.440* :  And then, police all over the world, monitoring the calls that were coming from these numbers.
*06:53.120- 06:58.100* :  Eventually, they recorded seven and a half thousand, which they thought were clear evidence
*06:58.100- 07:02.720* :  of scams. And at that point, they had enough evidence to launch a raid.
*07:02.720- 07:04.460* :  So what happened on this raid?
*07:04.720- 07:07.720* :  It was quite an operation because coordination was essential.
*07:07.720- 07:10.440* :  You didn't want one lot to get caught and tip off the others.
*07:11.040- 07:16.060* :  On the 18th of April, simultaneously, they raided these premises in five different countries.
*07:16.060- 07:19.420* :  The ones I mentioned, Germany, Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania, and Lebanon.
*07:19.420- 07:21.560* :  And they arrested 21 people.
*07:21.560- 07:23.340* :  And they also seized a lot of equipment.
*07:23.340- 07:28.240* :  They're hoping that that equipment might lead them to other scams being shut down.
*07:28.240- 07:30.260* :  But, you know, there's no way around it.
*07:30.260- 07:33.340* :  This is a bit of a mold-bashing exercise, as it's sometimes called.
*07:33.360- 07:35.020* :  You shut down one of these operations.
*07:35.020- 07:36.100* :  Another pops up.
*07:36.540- 07:40.140* :  Here in London, the Metropolitan Police launched an operation only last month,
*07:40.140- 07:44.940* :  where they cracked down on one bunch of criminals that had managed to get more than a million dollars
*07:45.460- 07:46.400* :  out of its victims.
*07:46.400- 07:49.180* :  I'm afraid that whatever success police have,
*07:49.660- 07:52.120* :  this is a crime that's going to be with us for an awfully long time.
*07:52.920- 07:53.540* :  Paul Moss.
*07:54.340- 07:59.600* :  Prosecutors at Donald Trump's Hush Money Trial in New York have called for the former president
*07:59.600- 08:03.080* :  to be fined for breaking his gagging order again.
*08:03.100- 08:08.280* :  The court has been hearing more testimony from Stormy Daniels former lawyer,
*08:08.780- 08:14.040* :  detailing how a $130,000 payment to the adult film star was arranged.
*08:14.560- 08:19.180* :  Mr. Trump denies falsifying business records to conceal illegal efforts
*08:19.680- 08:21.500* :  to influence the 2016 election.
*08:22.220- 08:24.660* :  From New York, our correspondent, Netta Torfick reports.
*08:25.540- 08:29.680* :  The former president is settling back into the routine of being in court after
*08:29.680- 08:32.600* :  two rallies yesterday in Wisconsin and Michigan.
*08:32.600- 08:35.860* :  Mr. Trump spoke to reporters as he arrived.
*08:36.260- 08:42.200* :  It was nice to be able to campaign one day without being in this ridiculous show trial.
*08:42.700- 08:49.100* :  I call it Keith Davidson, the lawyer who negotiated the Stormy Daniels Hush Money deal at the center
*08:49.100- 08:56.060* :  of the case, took jurors back to election night in 2016. At that time, he sent a text message
*08:56.060- 09:00.500* :  at three o'clock in the morning to an editor at the tabloid, the national inquirer.
*09:01.060- 09:03.040* :  He asked the editor, what have we done?
*09:03.040- 09:08.820* :  Explaining that message, Mr. Davidson told the court that there was an understanding that their
*09:08.860- 09:13.660* :  efforts may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
*09:13.840- 09:20.160* :  When the Wall Street Journal published stories in 2018 about the payments to the adult film star
*09:20.160- 09:26.680* :  and a playboy model, Mr. Davidson detailed the crisis discussions that ensued with Mr. Trump's lawyer,
*09:26.680- 09:33.080* :  Michael Cohen, on how to respond, including how to word a denial that Ms. Daniels issued but later
*09:33.080- 09:38.640* :  rescinded. On cross-examination by the defense, Mr. Davidson was asked if he ever
*09:38.640- 09:45.500* :  spoke to Mr. Trump to which he replied never. The days proceedings had begun with yet another hearing
*09:45.500- 09:51.240* :  about alleged violations of a limited gag order. The defense claimed that Mr. Trump as a presidential
*09:51.240- 09:57.040* :  candidate was being silenced while everyone else could speak freely about the trial. To that,
*09:57.040- 10:03.160* :  the judge reminded them that they were overlooking a very significant issue, Mr. Trump's position as
*10:03.160- 10:10.480* :  the defendant. Nutter Taufik in New York. Russia has been accused of causing disruption to satellite
*10:10.480- 10:16.700* :  navigation systems affecting thousands of civilian flights. The problem escalated with the start
*10:16.700- 10:22.540* :  of the invasion of Ukraine and is still getting worse. The areas at worst affected are the Baltic,
*10:22.540- 10:28.000* :  the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean regions where the Russian military has recently been
*10:28.000- 10:34.320* :  very active. Vitaly Shachenko reports. The main target of such interference is the popular
*10:34.320- 10:41.260* :  American global positioning system, or GPS. It has been subjected to jamming, as a result of which
*10:41.260- 10:48.100* :  aircraft were unable to receive its signals. This week, the Finnish airline Thinea suspended its
*10:48.100- 10:53.920* :  daily flights to Estonia's second largest city, Tartu, after two of its aircraft had to return
*10:53.920- 11:00.580* :  to Helsinki due to GPS interference. The airline says its pilots report several such cases of
*11:00.580- 11:08.380* :  interference today, and aviation officials say the total number exceeds 25,000 Estonia's foreign
*11:08.380- 11:14.500* :  minister, Margot Tachna, points to the finger of blame at Russia. Our authoritarian authorities
*11:15.100- 11:24.360* :  say confirm that the source of the interference is Russia, and this GPS signal is inferred
*11:25.420- 11:32.300* :  with from Russia as well as from Kaliningrad, and as well from this vicinity of Santa Petersburg
*11:32.380- 11:40.120* :  and also Skolf. So we have a proof that it is coming from Russia. They are violating
*11:40.120- 11:46.040* :  our territories, so they are actually putting our people and also the civil airplanes in danger,
*11:46.040- 11:50.240* :  and this is a violation of international agreements. They cannot do that.
*11:50.880- 11:56.300* :  But why would Russia want to meddle with navigation signals? Kear Giles, director of the
*11:56.300- 12:01.880* :  Conflict Studies Research Center at British Thing Tank, believes that Moscow is sowing disruption
*12:01.880- 12:08.120* :  and testing its ability for immobilizing Europe. Another reason he says is defending against
*12:08.120- 12:14.180* :  possible missile and drone attacks during the war with Ukraine. Navigation systems can support
*12:14.180- 12:19.880* :  drone operations as well as precision guided munitions. And Ukraine has already found a way
*12:19.880- 12:25.840* :  round Russia's GPS jamming using other navigational systems to carry out drone strike deep into Russia.
*12:26.440- 12:31.320* :  But of course that doesn't mean that Russia doesn't benefit from making sure that GPS simply
*12:31.320- 12:38.060* :  does not work when Ukraine wants to use it to target Russian positions or infrastructure within
*12:38.060- 12:44.220* :  Russia itself. Losing connection to GPS does not pose an immediate threat to safety,
*12:44.640- 12:50.500* :  as modern aircraft can normally use other ways of navigation. However, any disruption to such
*12:50.500- 12:56.240* :  an important system is still a significant risk. That report by Vitaly Shuchanko.
*12:57.380- 13:02.360* :  For most of its long history, women have been excluded from taking part in the tour de France
*13:02.360- 13:09.040* :  cycling race, apart from on a handful of occasions. But that changed in 2022 when a new
*13:09.040- 13:14.180* :  a women's event was launched. This summer we'll see the third edition of the Tour de France
*13:14.180- 13:18.480* :  FAM. There are some differences though. Lexioconna reports.
*13:26.780- 13:31.440* :  It's the world's best known cycling race, but though the Tour de France has been around since
*13:31.440- 13:38.820* :  1903, the women's version has only taken place on a handful of occasions, once in the 1950s and
*13:38.820- 13:46.080* :  then again for a few years in the 1980s. Then in 2022 after a long campaign by female cyclists
*13:46.080- 13:52.440* :  a new women's race was launched. But the racers only take part for eight days compared to the men's
*13:52.440- 13:58.100* :  three weeks, and the women's combined prize part is almost ten times less than the men's.
*13:58.340- 14:04.300* :  It's just really hard to be honest. You're on your limit pretty much the whole time especially
*14:04.300- 14:09.480* :  when you're racing at the front. I'm in a back garden in Stockport, Northern England,
*14:09.480- 14:14.960* :  and pro cyclist Alice Wood is putting her bike away after a morning training session.
*14:16.020- 14:21.540* :  Last year Alice race the Tour de France FAM with team human-powered health, something that as a young
*14:21.540- 14:26.200* :  girl she didn't think she'd ever be able to do. Some of the questions that you're always asked is,
*14:26.840- 14:31.380* :  have you ever done the Tour de France? And it was never an option to be able to say yes because
*14:31.380- 14:37.580* :  it was not a possibility for me as a female cyclist. Welcome back to Alice later. Fun fact though,
*14:37.580- 14:44.220* :  the full name of the race is the Tour de France FAM of X-Wift. That company signed a four-year deal
*14:44.220- 14:52.280* :  to sponsor the race in 2022. I didn't see this as a risk. I saw this more as a real exciting
*14:53.040- 15:00.200* :  opportunity. Meats with CEO and co-founder Eric Minne. It is a long-term investment. I think we're
*15:00.200- 15:05.940* :  just only getting started in the first two years. I've been very successful. It's been all the
*15:05.940- 15:12.840* :  targets that ASO and Zwift have set. So I don't see this slowing down. I only see this getting bigger.
*15:13.120- 15:18.400* :  The mind games between Jamie Vollering and Animate Van Vluten as we approach the cold at
*15:18.400- 15:25.060* :  all Malay. TV viewing figures for the women's race have been growing. On the broadcast a Euro
*15:25.060- 15:31.680* :  sport, 15 million people watched the race last year. That's a 7% increase on the year before.
*15:31.680- 15:37.200* :  Though the figures are impressive and growing, the women's race doesn't pull in anywhere near
*15:37.200- 15:43.300* :  the viewing figures that the men's race gets. The Tour de France men's race is 100 years old
*15:43.600- 15:50.480* :  and it would be completely unfair to compare any other race that started in the last four years,
*15:50.480- 15:57.400* :  men's or women's to that. Givouazan is Senior Director of Cycling at Warner Brothers Discovery,
*15:57.400- 16:04.320* :  which owns Euro sport. The women's race started with a huge bank. For us, all grand tours broke
*16:04.340- 16:12.520* :  records last year. The women's racing package is up 25% year on year for us and it's growing.
*16:13.220- 16:19.000* :  We began this by hearing from Tour de France competitor Alice Wood. I wanted to get her thoughts
*16:19.000- 16:25.720* :  on the disparity between the men's total prize fund of 2.3 million euros and the women's prize
*16:25.720- 16:35.800* :  fund of 250,000 euros, almost 10 times less. It's obviously not equal. I also know that the prize
*16:35.800- 16:41.740* :  money for me is always a benefit at the end of the day. You don't go to the race to win the prize
*16:41.740- 16:47.540* :  money, you go to do the best result and hopefully win stages and the prize money is kind of a cherry on
*16:47.540- 16:52.720* :  the cake, I guess. Pro cyclist Alice Wood ending that report by Lexi O'Connor.
*16:54.720- 17:00.060* :  Still to come, the billionaires in a land of supposed social equality. We have become more
*17:00.060- 17:04.260* :  a mentality of winner takes it all, that if you just play your cards right, you can also become
*17:04.260- 17:09.040* :  a billionaire, so why race of taxes? That's a quite a significant shift, I think, in Swedish mentality.

*18:24.640- 18:30.080* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The French Parliament has voted to set up a commission
*18:30.080- 18:35.200* :  to investigate sexual abuse in the film industry and other cultural sectors.
*18:35.200- 18:39.880* :  It comes off the back of a string of recent allegations of sexual assault and rape
*18:40.340- 18:46.900* :  by high-profile stars, such as the actor Gerard Depardieu. This week, green party lawmaker,
*18:46.900- 18:49.920* :  Francesca Pasquini welcomed the decision.
*18:53.360- 18:59.380* :  It's time to stop rolling out the red carpet for abusers. We owe it to the thousands of victims
*18:59.380- 19:02.980* :  who have spoken out, and I hope they will continue to do so.
*19:04.020- 19:08.420* :  So what is the scope of this commission? Hugh Scoffield is our correspondent in Paris.
*19:08.880- 19:13.940* :  It looks at the problem, which they've identified in the film industry, but not just in the film
*19:13.940- 19:21.200* :  industry and the sort of arts industry, more widely, into sexual abuse. Originally, the remit
*19:21.300- 19:25.640* :  supposed to be into abuse of teenagers or minors, but I think it more broadly been extended
*19:25.900- 19:32.780* :  to abuse of anyone. The idea being that there is an endemic problem, going back many, many years,
*19:33.420- 19:40.500* :  based around the influence of certain key people, mainly men, directors, actors, and so on,
*19:40.500- 19:48.020* :  who have used their influence and their power to have their way with young women,
*19:48.020- 19:52.240* :  women of all ages. All of this going back, of course, to the case of Judith Godresche,
*19:52.500- 19:59.340* :  the actress who was in Parliament today when we was voted on, whose revelations about her own
*19:59.340- 20:04.460* :  pass are very, very much behind all of this. You mentioned Ms. Godresche there, to what extent
*20:05.180- 20:10.900* :  is this a result of years of issues that have been swept under the carpet coming to the
*20:10.900- 20:14.920* :  floor now? I mean, that remains to be seen, but certainly what we have seen in the last couple
*20:14.920- 20:21.840* :  of years are more and more cases like this, and not just in the film industry, but in the world
*20:21.840- 20:25.920* :  of literature as well. The obviously part of it is very much a sort of parallel with the Me Too
*20:25.920- 20:30.420* :  of Movement and the Harvey Weinstein source. Indeed, Judith Godresche was one of the women who
*20:30.420- 20:35.120* :  complained about him when that all began. What she would say, I think it's true, is that there's
*20:35.120- 20:38.880* :  a particularly French context to this, which makes it a bit different from the context elsewhere.
*20:39.220- 20:45.560* :  The origin of this, certainly for her, was a kind of intellectual environment in the 70s, 80s,
*20:45.560- 20:51.460* :  90s, extending up to today, which means that people who are honored and regarded as culturally
*20:51.460- 20:59.160* :  significant in the world of film or literature are given huge power and not questioned in any way.
*20:59.640- 21:07.240* :  So it was that in her case, she was at the age of 1415 living with a man of 40,
*21:07.260- 21:12.160* :  there from the Recepun Roygecu, who she's filed suit against now. Because of an atmosphere at
*21:12.160- 21:17.320* :  the time, which made it impossible for people to say, oh, that's just not right, it would have been
*21:17.320- 21:22.780* :  regarded as rather backward looking back then to say that there was a problem there. But it was the
*21:22.780- 21:28.660* :  intellectual atmosphere, the cultural atmosphere, which allowed these directors, these actors,
*21:28.660- 21:32.160* :  these people of influence in the arts to get away with what they did.
*21:32.380- 21:37.300* :  And now we've got this commission. Would you say that this commission is likely to bring about
*21:37.300- 21:41.380* :  a change in the culture across France, or has that already happened, you think?
*21:41.560- 21:46.360* :  I think it's already happening. There are people who say that France is still dragging its feet
*21:46.360- 21:51.160* :  in all of this and they would point to the Gerard Depardier affair and the way the President
*21:51.160- 21:58.020* :  Macron famously led to his defence a couple of months back when his name was being exposed as
*21:58.140- 22:02.040* :  that of someone who's allegedly committed sexual abuse. What will happen with this commission?
*22:02.040- 22:05.720* :  I don't know. I mean, it's only a parliamentary commission, it's the only group of MPs who are
*22:05.720- 22:09.060* :  going to look into this, make recommendations that maybe that there'll be laws that have changed,
*22:09.060- 22:11.520* :  but I suspect it's much more of a cultural thing that has to change.
*22:11.960- 22:17.700* :  Husco filled in France. The family of a gay British Mexican man, Manuel Guerrero
*22:17.700- 22:24.160* :  Avinia held in Qatar for alleged drug offences has given further details of what they say
*22:24.160- 22:30.400* :  was a honey trap operation using the gay dating app Grindr. According to his brother Enrique,
*22:30.400- 22:37.020* :  Manuel was approached online by a man called Gio and they arranged to meet. But he was instead
*22:37.020- 22:42.960* :  met by police and arrested on false drug charges. His family say Manuel, who has HIV,
*22:42.960- 22:48.420* :  has now completely run out of his usual medication. James Reynolds spoke to our diplomatic
*22:48.420- 22:54.740* :  correspondent Caroline Hawley and LGBT and identity producer Josh Parry, who've both been working
*22:54.740- 22:59.840* :  on this story and have spoken to Enrique. Caroline told us first more about Manuel.
*23:00.500- 23:05.400* :  He is an airline manager, he's 44 years old as you said he's a British Mexican passport
*23:05.440- 23:09.620* :  holder. He'd worked in Qatar happily for seven years with a good job and nice apartment
*23:10.600- 23:16.840* :  until February and that was when he was approached over initially Grindr then Tinder by somebody
*23:16.840- 23:22.480* :  calling themselves Gio, who wanted to meet up with him, who wanted him to bring other gay men.
*23:22.620- 23:29.540* :  The man that he thinks is Gio rings the doorbell when they do arrange to meet up and Manuel asks
*23:29.580- 23:34.760* :  him to come up to the apartment and he says no, come down to the lobby and when he goes down to
*23:34.760- 23:41.120* :  the lobby of his building he is handcuffed. And the family say that drugs are then planted on him.
*23:41.120- 23:47.080* :  He's taken to a police station according to his brother where he sees four people being whipped.
*23:47.780- 23:53.120* :  He says that in the police station he sees a whole unit of policemen on a whole range of gay dating
*23:53.160- 23:58.300* :  apps and when he sees people being whipped he's told that that could happen to him too if he
*23:58.300- 24:02.940* :  doesn't confess. They want him to unlock his phone share details of his sexual partners.
*24:02.940- 24:09.080* :  Eventually he does thumbprint a confession and Amnesty and to National has described it all as a
*24:09.080- 24:15.540* :  horrific experience and the family says he experienced homophobic comments that he was held in a
*24:15.540- 24:22.080* :  crowded cell with dozens of people when it was meant for for far less that he was put in solitary
*24:22.080- 24:26.680* :  confinement when they found out he had HIV because they were worried it could be passed on.
*24:27.220- 24:34.200* :  At one point he went for 15 to 20 hours without food or water that medication was withheld in a
*24:34.200- 24:42.380* :  way of pressuring him. So accounts that human rights watch and other human rights activists
*24:42.380- 24:49.900* :  have expressed concern about and they've said this does fit a pattern of how a cutter has treated
*24:49.900- 24:55.280* :  LGBT people in the past. And let's turn to Josh now. Tell us more about Grindr.
*24:55.540- 25:03.020* :  So Grindr is a would call itself a social networking app for the gay bisexual and trans male
*25:03.020- 25:10.240* :  community but really what it's largely used for is kind of hook up shall we say or more casual
*25:10.240- 25:15.280* :  encounters might be a more polite way of putting it and it but also when you think internationally
*25:15.280- 25:20.620* :  and you look at look at the picture were in more than 60 countries it's still illegal to be gay.
*25:21.020- 25:26.420* :  In those countries Grindr says it can be a real lifeline to people trying to make a community when
*25:26.420- 25:32.960* :  perhaps it's not safe or or advised to create that community in person and so it's really
*25:32.960- 25:39.180* :  used for a real wide range of things but it has become a real staple of the LGBT community.
*25:39.980- 25:45.480* :  And Caroline to the story then back to the story of Manuel Geredel Avinia what situation is he
*25:45.480- 25:50.600* :  in right now? Well he is on provisional release there was a court hearing last Monday he has been charged
*25:50.600- 25:56.000* :  with using and possessing drugs he's staying with friends because he hasn't been paid since all
*25:56.000- 26:00.660* :  this happened so he can't afford to keep up his apartment his passport has been taken away
*26:01.540- 26:07.580* :  and amnesty who I referred to earlier are concerned about whether he can get a fair trial when
*26:07.580- 26:14.340* :  for weeks he had no lawyer no translator when he was in jail and he didn't know the exact charges
*26:14.840- 26:20.240* :  against him or have any access to court documents until just a few days before the court hearing
*26:20.240- 26:26.000* :  but a situation is out on provisional release at the moment but he has run out now of the
*26:26.000- 26:31.280* :  medication prescribed for him by UK doctors. What has the state of Qatar said? Well they are
*26:31.280- 26:36.360* :  absolutely insisting that this is all about drugs they say he acknowledged the possession of them
*26:36.760- 26:41.400* :  now his family says it was a confession that he was forced to make in the middle of the night
*26:41.400- 26:46.260* :  and then the other court hearing later that he denied it and has always denied possessing and
*26:46.260- 26:53.300* :  using drugs. The Qataris say that a drugs test confirmed the presence in his body of amphetamine
*26:53.300- 26:58.760* :  and methamphetamine family don't deny that there was some kind of a drugs test but say the result
*26:58.760- 27:05.160* :  was just a scribbled note claiming the presence of these control substances. The Qataris insist
*27:05.160- 27:10.100* :  it wasn't about his sexuality and they said it was just about drugs no other factors were taken
*27:10.100- 27:15.300* :  into account they said in a statement and the insisting was treated with dignity and respects.
*27:16.140- 27:22.460* :  Caroline Hawley and Josh Perry. As Sweden become a paradise for the super rich
*27:23.280- 27:28.500* :  for decades the Nordic country has enjoyed a global reputation for championing social equality
*27:29.120- 27:33.620* :  but there's been a rapid boom in the number of Swedish multi-millionaires and even billionaires
*27:33.620- 27:39.240* :  in recent years and there are growing debates about how that's impacting the economy and Swedish
*27:39.240- 27:45.800* :  values. I spoke to Madi Savage in Stockholm. The rhetoric coming out of the tech scene over the last
*27:45.800- 27:51.040* :  few years has been one of well we're a country that's tech savvy we're a digital country we've got a
*27:51.040- 27:56.420* :  culture of innovation and collaboration and that's enabled us to punch above our weight in tech and
*27:56.420- 28:02.120* :  business creating a lot of new dollar billionaires and millionaires in relation to our population size
*28:02.120- 28:08.260* :  Sweden has just 10 million people living there but another argument has been coming through pushed
*28:08.260- 28:12.840* :  by a Swedish author and journalist called Andreas Savenko who recently wrote a book called
*28:13.240- 28:18.560* :  greedy Sweden and he pointed out that there have been things like tech companies and property
*28:18.560- 28:24.380* :  shooting up in value because of low interest rates until recently and also that Sweden has
*28:24.380- 28:30.700* :  surprisingly perhaps a tax system that favors the super rich so although taxes on salaries here are
*28:30.700- 28:36.760* :  high the taxes you pay on money made from stocks and payouts to shareholders is much lower and
*28:36.760- 28:42.380* :  Sweden has also scrapped inheritance tax so that's made it easier in some ways for the rich to get
*28:42.380- 28:47.520* :  richer over the last couple of decades and for new entrepreneurs to break through. And Madi you've
*28:47.520- 28:52.380* :  been speaking to millionaires and billionaires about how they've made and spent their money haven't
*28:52.380- 28:57.100* :  you? Yeah I got to look around quite a fancy mansion and to meet up with some very wealthy
*28:57.100- 29:02.860* :  individuals but what's interesting is that a lot of Swedes are quite subtle in terms of how they
*29:02.860- 29:08.180* :  spend their money so it's quite rare to build, say, a massive house with 20 bedrooms or to own
*29:08.180- 29:14.940* :  a fleet of yachts or cars. Here's Ola Alderson who's a serial entrepreneur who's been running businesses
*29:14.940- 29:22.340* :  since the 90s. Sweden has a tradition of frugality as championed by the likes of IKEA, the CEO and founder
*29:22.340- 29:28.140* :  never went first class and so forth. There's a lot of rhetorics around the frugal suite if you spend
*29:28.140- 29:33.840* :  money on unnecessary luxury in Switzerland that means that you are a gentleman and you have
*29:33.840- 29:38.880* :  style in finesse. In Sweden it means you're immature if you put too much money into fancy cars and
*29:38.880- 29:43.940* :  gold watchers and so forth. He told me he's not materialistic and he spends a lot of his money
*29:43.940- 29:50.460* :  on property and throwing parties. There's also a trend for something called impact investing in Sweden
*29:50.460- 29:56.480* :  so reinvesting in companies that improve society or the environment. Sweden's top in the EU when
*29:56.480- 30:02.540* :  it comes to this. The countries had a long focus and interest in sustainability but perhaps it's
*30:02.540- 30:08.220* :  also linked to this lack of flashiness in Sweden. People can feel a bit uncomfortable with too much
*30:08.220- 30:13.580* :  wealth so they reinvest it. And Maddie, is there much debate in Sweden about the rise of the
*30:13.580- 30:18.640* :  super rich? Surprisingly little. There's currently a right-wing coalition in power so you might
*30:18.640- 30:24.580* :  understand why it's not their top priority. So to summarize I think Sweden's perhaps not as equal
*30:24.580- 30:29.780* :  as its global image or the global stereotype that it's had over the last few years and interestingly
*30:29.780- 30:35.760* :  a lot of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of white men as well. And you can listen to Maddie's
*30:35.760- 30:41.920* :  documentary, super rich Swedes on the BBC World Service online and wherever you get your podcasts.
*30:43.440- 30:50.680* :  Now a first for wildlife observation. An orangutan in Indonesia has been spotted apparently
*30:51.100- 30:57.560* :  treating himself for a wound on his face using a poultice made from a plant. He was seen making a
*30:57.560- 31:03.020* :  paste with the chewed up leaves of a medicinal plant. A science reporter Georgina Ranhard explains.
*31:09.140- 31:15.460* :  This is how it started. Raccozi orangutan crying out before he was injured in what was probably
*31:15.460- 31:20.700* :  a fight with other males. It left him with a large red wound under his right eye.
*31:21.380- 31:26.880* :  What happened next amazed researchers in the Gunning Loaser National Park. They saw Raccozi chewing
*31:26.880- 31:32.380* :  the leaves of the medicinal plant at our cunning which has antibacterial properties that local people
*31:32.380- 31:38.200* :  use to treat malaria. After chomping for seven minutes he put some leafy liquid on his injury.
*31:38.780- 31:43.500* :  Then he chewed the leaves into a paste and applied it onto his wound covering the
*31:43.520- 31:48.640* :  saw as if with a poultice or a plaster. Five days later the scientist saw the wound
*31:48.640- 31:54.760* :  had closed up and within a month it had healed. Isabellauma is a biologist at the Max Planck
*31:54.760- 32:00.220* :  Institute in Constant Germany. She says it's another reminder of how closely related we are to
*32:00.220- 32:06.720* :  great apes. We humans we treat our wounds and but also forms of active wound treatment can be
*32:06.720- 32:12.100* :  found in the African grade apes and also in the Asian grade apes. It's also possible that our
*32:12.100- 32:19.180* :  last common ancestor already showed similar ointment behaviour so these are the more the evolutionary
*32:19.260- 32:24.660* :  implications of this behaviour. Researchers already knew that chimpanzees sometimes swallowed
