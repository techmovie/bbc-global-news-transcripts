*01:40.140- 01:47.060* :  pod. Here how we give value to River Trash. And I'm Janak Jalil. Also in this edition a groundbreaking
*01:47.060- 01:53.200* :  gene therapy treatment that means a death child can now hear. They played us the sounds that she
*01:53.200- 01:58.260* :  was turning to and they're quite mind blown by how soft it was, how quiet it was. They're sounds
*01:58.260- 02:03.380* :  that I think in day to day life you might not even notice yourself sort of thing. And a welcomed
*02:03.380- 02:11.440* :  invasion of San Francisco. It is crazy. I've never seen that many sea lions in one place.
*02:11.820- 02:14.760* :  It's just so cool to see them all here. They're so loud.
*02:17.220- 02:23.560* :  Hundreds of sea lions stopping by. Also in this podcast. Reconnections might remind you of
*02:23.560- 02:28.720* :  kind of old versions of yourself, old memories, wonderful times. Might open up all wonderful

*02:35.200- 02:52.020* :  and after sea girl boy we bring you lion girl. Self-proclaimed lion expert Riley is five.
*02:57.960- 03:02.760* :  They thought they'd landed in paradise. Three siblings moved from France to the
*03:02.760- 03:09.040* :  Indonesian island of Bali as teenagers. And it was a deal except for one huge problem.
*03:09.040- 03:15.240* :  The tide of plastic washing up on the tropical island's beaches and rivers. But Gary Kelly and Sam,
*03:15.240- 03:23.020* :  or perhaps I should say Gary Kelly and Sam were not going to let that spoil their new home as Sophie Smith found out.
*03:23.020- 03:34.980* :  Men, women and children are clearing mounds of plastic that flowed along this river in Bali,
*03:34.980- 03:39.780* :  Indonesia. They're collecting rubbish that's trapped against a wooden barrier, deliberately
*03:39.780- 03:46.520* :  placed there to stop it flowing into the sea. It's all part of a cleanup by 27-year-old
*03:46.520- 03:53.520* :  Sam Benjigib and his siblings Gary and Kelly who founded their organization Sun Guy Watch three and a
*03:53.520- 04:01.860* :  half years ago. Here's Sam. So we moved to Bali and Indonesia in 2005 and when we moved you know
*04:01.860- 04:07.300* :  Bali's really beautiful paradise island but we quickly started seeing more and more plastics
*04:07.300- 04:12.940* :  wash up on our beaches and we realized that most of the plastics in the ocean comes from rivers
*04:13.340- 04:18.140* :  and Indonesia being the bean ranked for many years as the second biggest polluter to the ocean.
*04:18.960- 04:23.800* :  We started focusing our efforts on cleaning rivers and making sure that plastics
*04:23.800- 04:29.040* :  doesn't reach the ocean in the first place. Since setting up the organization, Sam and the rest of the
*04:29.040- 04:34.400* :  team have pulled two million kilos of rubbish out of Indonesia's rivers. They have installed
*04:34.400- 04:41.800* :  275 barriers and now pull out 4,000 kilos of plastics every day. We're really looking
*04:41.800- 04:49.960* :  for ways to localize our efforts. So right now at Sun Guy Watch we have 140 full-time staff that are
*04:49.960- 04:53.860* :  really our heroes. We call them our river warriors. They're the ones that you know are jumping into
*04:53.860- 04:59.400* :  rivers every day and you know half our team is in our facilities sorting through the trash that we
*04:59.400- 05:05.060* :  collect. Sam, Gary and Kelly's team also work upstream at the root of the problem. They speak
*05:05.060- 05:10.540* :  to schools, governments and local communities to try and stop the plastic from getting into the river
*05:10.540- 05:15.180* :  in the first place. We don't want to be cleaning rivers for the rest of our lives. You know we want
*05:15.180- 05:21.920* :  to put ourselves out of business that is essentially our goal and for that we really need to make this
*05:21.920- 05:26.180* :  as local as possible and that's why our name is Sun Guy Watch. Sun Guy means river and Indonesian.
*05:26.880- 05:31.320* :  You know when you see a polluted river and you can't see the water it feels like
*05:32.100- 05:37.640* :  sort of an apocalypse and you really think that the world is ending. So having this idea that
*05:37.720- 05:42.700* :  people can take these rivers and clean them up for themselves and really see them before and after
*05:42.700- 05:47.600* :  I think that's probably the most inspiring part of our work. The team has also started a new venture
*05:47.600- 05:52.840* :  Sun Guy design which launched in March this year. This is where the trash gets turned into value
*05:53.260- 05:59.600* :  or to be more specific where plastic bags get turned into chairs. Each chair is made from 2000
*05:59.600- 06:05.540* :  plastic bags that volunteers have collected. The revenue that's made from selling them goes back
*06:05.540- 06:11.440* :  into the charity to help clean even more rivers. You know we thought what if we could take every
*06:11.440- 06:17.400* :  single piece of trash out there that's in a river and upcycle it and turn it into something that's
*06:17.400- 06:23.520* :  cool that's practical but more importantly that replaces new virgin materials. So what's next
*06:23.520- 06:28.300* :  for Sam and the rest of Sun Guy Watch? Right now we're working on a project to extend our work
*06:28.800- 06:32.640* :  outside of Indonesia. How can we potentially you know bring this work to other countries
*06:33.260- 06:38.480* :  we get so many reach outs every day people saying can you please come do what you do here
*06:38.840- 06:43.620* :  and I think for us that really shows us the potential that Sun Guy Watch has not just in Indonesia
*06:43.620- 06:52.900* :  but really across the world. Now to an amazing medical breakthrough that's brought hope to the
*06:52.900- 06:59.700* :  parents of death children. In a world first 18 month old Opal Sandy who was born death now has
*06:59.900- 07:05.500* :  near normal hearing thanks to a gene therapy study running in the US the UK and Spain
*07:06.260- 07:12.420* :  and just six months after the treatment she's learning how much fun sounds can be. Holly Gibbs reports
*07:14.020- 07:20.760* :  Opal style. Opal who lives in southern England was treated shortly before her first birthday.
*07:20.760- 07:26.260* :  She can now hear sounds as soft as a whisper and as even starting to say words like mama,
*07:26.260- 07:32.180* :  dadda and uh oh. Her mum Joe says they had been nervous about taking part in the trial.
*07:32.600- 07:40.320* :  It was really scary but I think we'd been given a really unique opportunity with no real evidence
*07:41.620- 07:46.800* :  that any harm or adverse effects was likely to come to her and I think a lot of parents with
*07:47.120- 07:52.080* :  regardless of their difficulties their children face to be given an opportunity to potentially
*07:53.020- 07:58.220* :  make obstacles easier for her to overcome was a risk definitely worth taking.
*07:58.720- 08:03.640* :  Joe and her husband James were stunned by the result. They described the moment they realised
*08:03.640- 08:08.800* :  their daughter could hear. Absolutely mind blowing. I was at work at the time and you
*08:08.820- 08:13.480* :  messaged me to say say what had gone on and I'm not sure I bleed at the start. I think I
*08:13.480- 08:18.960* :  said it was just a fluke you know she must have reacted to something else. I got home from work
*08:18.960- 08:26.120* :  and was straight away. That was 24 weeks post surgery and we heard the phrase near a normal hearing.
*08:26.240- 08:31.220* :  She was turning to really soft sounds and they played us the sounds that she was
*08:31.860- 08:37.040* :  turning to and they were quite mind blown by how soft it was, how quiet it was.
*08:37.240- 08:41.960* :  Like they're sounds that I think in day to day life you might not even notice yourself sort of thing.
*08:42.140- 08:46.940* :  Doctors in other countries including China are exploring similar treatments for the gene mutation
*08:46.940- 08:52.060* :  that Opal has and it's hoped the technique could be adapted to help treat other genetic conditions.
*08:52.220- 08:57.580* :  It's estimated that more than 30 million children worldwide have some sort of hearing loss
*08:57.580- 09:03.620* :  and 40% of cases have some genetic link. Dr Richard Brown, one of Opal's doctors at Adam
*09:03.620- 09:08.820* :  Brooks Hospital in Cambridge in eastern England says the gene therapy fixed the 40 cells that
*09:08.820- 09:13.600* :  carry signals from the ear to the brain. The lovely thing about this condition when you're
*09:13.640- 09:18.340* :  thinking about it as a candidate for gene therapy is that everything is anatomically absolutely
*09:18.340- 09:23.820* :  perfect. So Opal's cochlear which is a little shell shaped organ in her inner ear that allows
*09:23.820- 09:29.140* :  you to hear sound is structurally perfect and all that we need to do is to drop in the gene
*09:29.140- 09:35.180* :  therapy with the working gene and then the cochlear will start speaking to that nerve that then
*09:35.180- 09:39.780* :  takes the signal to the brain. This has been really exciting for us because it means that there's
*09:39.780- 09:44.900* :  a tiny little target for the gene therapy so we can deliver the gene therapy just locally
*09:44.900- 09:50.120* :  to the inner ear without needing to give a big dose to the rest of the body and that means that
*09:50.120- 09:55.760* :  we can be much more assured that it will be safe and that the gene therapy won't cause any
*09:56.120- 10:01.040* :  adverse effects. Then the news of course that it worked for Opal and that she could hear
*10:01.580- 10:07.060* :  with a very near normal thresholds on our audiology testing was just really exciting for us.
*10:07.200- 10:12.340* :  This is what we sometimes refer to as a one and done therapy so you can do a treatment that we
*10:12.340- 10:17.760* :  hope will be a cure for this type of hearing loss and potentially we could develop other gene therapies
*10:18.200- 10:25.620* :  for other genetic hearing loss and even other conditions such as neurology, metabolic and hematological
*10:25.620- 10:31.680* :  conditions. If you can treat those children early in a one and done way that doesn't then require
*10:32.240- 10:38.400* :  ongoing care lots of sort of technological support additional equipment which is the case for
*10:38.400- 10:42.360* :  some forms of hearing support and of course other types of support necessary medicine.
*10:42.500- 10:46.460* :  Potentially you can see that this might be an exciting development for the developing world.
*10:46.460- 10:51.280* :  Dr Richard Bram now if you've been thinking about trying to reconnect with an old friend
*10:51.380- 10:57.780* :  but have been hesitating about making the first move a new study may help you go for it.
*10:57.780- 11:03.880* :  The researchers say people who overcame their reluctance and reached out reported feeling happier
*11:04.460- 11:09.860* :  and that old friends appreciated even more than you might expect and the study was carried out by
*11:09.860- 11:15.380* :  two friends who had reconnected themselves. Dr Jillian Sandstrom an expert in the psychology of
*11:15.380- 11:20.980* :  kindness at the University of Sussex in southern England and Dr Lera Aknin who runs the helping
*11:20.980- 11:27.580* :  and happiness lab at Simon Fraser University near Vancouver in Canada. Lera told me how their
*11:27.580- 11:34.560* :  own reunion inspired their work. So Jillian and I are friends from graduate school and over the years
*11:34.560- 11:40.380* :  we worked together on multiple projects. About two years ago now I was missing Jill our projects
*11:40.380- 11:45.160* :  had kind of wrapped up but I waited until New Year's Day until I kind of had a reason to reach out
*11:45.160- 11:50.380* :  to her and I said I miss you we should find a new project to reconnect over. All of a sudden our text
*11:50.380- 11:54.900* :  messages started pinging back and forth and we were back in touch and you know we kind of said maybe
*11:54.900- 11:59.680* :  we should take some inspiration from our experience and start studying what might help people reach out
*11:59.680- 12:05.280* :  to old friends. And Jillian how did you feel about this? You know the fact that it felt so difficult
*12:05.280- 12:11.440* :  to reach out when it hadn't been objectively that long since we talked who made me wonder
*12:11.820- 12:16.200* :  how much harder it must be to reach out when it's been a longer time since you've been in touch with
*12:16.220- 12:23.420* :  someone. So tell us about this research and why it is you think that it is so hard for people to
*12:23.420- 12:29.200* :  reconnect with old friends that they've touched with. In general humans seem to feel like they're
*12:29.260- 12:33.980* :  better than average so we think we're a better driver than other people are more honest than other
*12:33.980- 12:40.320* :  people but in terms of social stuff social skills we seem to think we're worse than other people
*12:40.320- 12:45.760* :  and it's the only domain that we really know of where this is true so you enjoy talking to someone
*12:45.760- 12:50.300* :  else but you think they don't enjoy talking to you as much as you enjoy talking to them so there's
*12:50.780- 12:55.800* :  this gap we feel like people don't want to hear from us that it might be a bit awkward we feel guilty
*12:55.800- 13:01.220* :  that we've lost touch with them we feel like it's all our fault part of the reason is that we just
*13:01.320- 13:05.820* :  seem to feel that way in general about many of our social skills. Well I can kind of sympathise
*13:05.880- 13:10.420* :  and understand where a lot of people are coming from about talking to strangers it seemed
*13:10.420- 13:14.120* :  especially puzzling to me that people might be so reluctant to reach out to old friends.
*13:14.540- 13:19.600* :  And yet Jillian and we see with the two of you it worked out really well and so your
*13:19.600- 13:24.700* :  inspiration perhaps to people listening who might want to reconnect with an old friend what would
*13:24.700- 13:29.500* :  you say to someone who's listening right now and is still hesitating to get back in touch with
*13:29.560- 13:33.580* :  someone from the past. I mean I guess one of the things that I think about is what do you have to
*13:33.580- 13:39.440* :  lose right? It could feel a little bit bad if they don't respond but we're more resilient to
*13:39.440- 13:43.740* :  these kind of things than we think we are and we don't have to take it personally there's lots of
*13:44.100- 13:47.880* :  you know lots of reasons by someone might not respond they might be too busy or they might be
*13:47.880- 13:52.400* :  dealing with something really stressful in their life it might not be about you so we can choose
*13:52.400- 13:57.980* :  to you know how we interpret that lack of response if that were to happen but if you think about
*13:57.980- 14:03.400* :  what the best case scenario is it means you know reconnecting with someone that you you know
*14:03.400- 14:09.140* :  spent good times with and the fact that this offers the potential to to bring more social connection
*14:09.140- 14:14.900* :  into your life is just a really positive thing. And there are there is something special about
*14:14.900- 14:21.520* :  old friendships isn't there? There is certainly a valuable source of of connection and meaning just
*14:21.520- 14:27.680* :  like you know we might receive from long standing close ties but reconnections especially with
*14:27.680- 14:32.320* :  people from distant past a distant past might remind you of kind of old versions of yourself old
*14:32.320- 14:39.340* :  memories wonderful times it might open a whole wonderful series of memories that you can kind of
*14:39.340- 14:46.740* :  reflect upon. Lara and Jillian talking about their research and their friendship as well as your
*14:46.740- 14:51.120* :  stories about reaching out to someone you've lost touch with we also wanted to know if you bumped
*14:51.120- 14:57.640* :  into old friends or acquaintances far from home after we covered the remarkable coincidence of more
*14:57.640- 15:03.900* :  than 500 people from the Canadian island of Newfoundland ending up on the same Caribbean cruise
*15:04.900- 15:12.600* :  several of you have been in touch including Forest. Hi my name is Forest Hild I'm from Washington state
*15:12.600- 15:20.840* :  USA and in the summer of 2013 I was in Costa Rica helping teach English and doing renovations on a
*15:20.840- 15:26.940* :  local rural school in Central Highlands of the country. I was there for a month and a half and on
*15:26.940- 15:34.160* :  my way back I ran into my high school Spanish teacher Dan and his family at the airport in San
*15:34.160- 15:43.580* :  Juan. We swapped stories and before we knew it we were flying the same flight back went through
*15:43.580- 15:50.020* :  customs together cut the connecting flight back to Colorado right up to the time and we said goodbye to
*15:50.020- 15:58.220* :  each other at the baggage claim. Dan if you're hearing this I hope you're doing well and thanks for
*15:58.220- 16:02.740* :  everything that you taught me. At least he didn't call them sir which is what I did when I bumped into
*16:02.740- 16:08.180* :  a much loved teacher years after leaving school. Let us know your stories and as it's just been
*16:08.180- 16:13.460* :  teacher appreciation week in the US we'd also love to hear about any of your teachers who made a

*20:18.800- 20:20.980* :  from lions to sea lions
*20:28.160- 20:34.580* :  without the sound of hundreds of the big-eyed long-wispered sea creatures stopping off at San Francisco Bay
*20:34.580- 20:41.800* :  in the US to refuel and rest on their journey south the spot pier 39 is famous for attracting
*20:41.800- 20:48.320* :  migrating sea lions but this spring has seen the highest numbers for 15 years with more than
*20:48.320- 20:55.200* :  1000 recorded there in the past few weeks visitors have been impressed by the site and have given
*20:55.200- 21:01.600* :  their seal of approval it is crazy I've never seen that many sea lions in one place I've
*21:01.600- 21:06.060* :  heard about that place and we came here a few minutes ago and it's awesome to see them it's very
*21:06.060- 21:10.440* :  loud of course but it's it's really nice to see all of them and it's funny to watch them fight and
*21:10.440- 21:14.860* :  relax in the sun it's not like in a zoo they're not trapped they can be here if they want to be here
*21:14.860- 21:19.340* :  but it's just so cool to see them all here it's so interesting they're so loud
*21:21.320- 21:26.460* :  Sheila Chanda the harbour master at pier 39 says it's great to see such large numbers return
*21:27.520- 21:33.180* :  when they first came here in the early 90s we did have these kind of numbers in fact they got up
*21:33.220- 21:39.540* :  to 1700 sometimes but over the years that's dwindled down to an average I would save between
*21:39.580- 21:47.120* :  three and four hundred in the winter and as the spring comes in maybe up to 700 so you're
*21:47.120- 21:53.120* :  looking at you know almost double the numbers and the reason they've arrived is there's a huge
*21:53.120- 21:57.800* :  school of anchovy that was off the feral on islands that's in the bay right now
*21:57.800- 22:04.120* :  so it's all about the seafood it's all about the food and these animals a lot of them are on
*22:04.120- 22:09.700* :  their way down south at the moment a big herd of them are on the way down south for the mating season
*22:10.160- 22:15.320* :  it's a very good way to put it is that they're fueling up for the mating season and you know it's
*22:15.320- 22:20.240* :  spring you know they're ready to rock and roll down in the channel islands and we're a nice little
*22:20.240- 22:26.280* :  pit stop with some great seafood the bay is very healthy right now if it wasn't we wouldn't see
*22:26.280- 22:33.300* :  these kind of numbers for sure so it's good news all around Sheila Chandor and talking about food
*22:33.300- 22:40.860* :  a picnic can be a great way to relax and catch up all you need is some great food friends and
*22:40.860- 22:47.280* :  hopefully sunshine a bit of a challenge here in often great rainy Britain but for neurodivergent
*22:47.280- 22:53.960* :  people such as those with ADHD autism or bipolar disorder attending a social gathering like this
*22:53.960- 23:00.520* :  can be overwhelming well an organization called the Peruvian neurodivergent coalition has found a
*23:00.520- 23:07.260* :  solution a unique type of picnic one with no social norms or rules where everyone feels relaxed
*23:07.260- 23:12.860* :  and welcome the happy pods anna murthy found out more from the organization's co-founder
*23:12.860- 23:20.680* :  carolina dias when you are neurodivergent you feel that the challenge that you face are you need like
*23:21.120- 23:26.680* :  you are the only person in the world that feel that way but when we start the
*23:26.680- 23:31.780* :  picnics we discover that we were not alone in the world what's it like to be at one of these
*23:31.780- 23:36.620* :  picnics can you describe it for me how does it work what do you do what's the atmosphere like
*23:36.620- 23:44.460* :  we try not to have rules we have what it's called rule no rule we always say it's not mandatory to
*23:44.460- 23:51.020* :  look in the eyes of other people you you don't have to talk if you don't want to you just can stay
*23:51.020- 23:58.700* :  there and enjoy and do whatever you can read a book you can go if you feel tired you don't have to
*23:58.700- 24:06.820* :  give us an explanation we want us to be a different space as we we face every day and we use this
*24:07.240- 24:14.300* :  system when we put different colored bracelets red and green for the people imagine if someone
*24:15.000- 24:22.780* :  doesn't feel the need to speak is tired is overstimulated so the person can choose the red
*24:22.780- 24:28.420* :  bracelet so it's about making an environment where people feel that they can socialize and be
*24:28.420- 24:35.200* :  together but without any pressure or expectations we were told they feel some pressure to talk so
*24:35.200- 24:42.420* :  that system is very helpful and the new people when we talk about that they feel very calm
*24:42.880- 24:49.580* :  they feel very safe there people all the time are telling us that they don't feel as lonely
*24:50.040- 24:56.300* :  anymore they they feel like they found that place where they belong the first time that
*24:56.300- 25:02.620* :  somebody told me you saved my life I didn't believe it never in my crazy dreams I would
*25:02.620- 25:08.460* :  thought that somebody would tell me that I will be considered an important part of their life
*25:08.940- 25:15.520* :  not only you go to the techniques you have online community with different groups we have
*25:15.520- 25:23.500* :  group for parents groups for video game lovers to find y'all we have group for exercise so they
*25:23.500- 25:31.400* :  also feel empowered to do their own stuff like there are people who become advocates to talk about
*25:31.400- 25:38.080* :  their experience openly and they feel free to share and we love that so it's not only
*25:39.000- 25:44.960* :  that they attend the meetings but that they feel empowered to talk about their experience and
*25:44.960- 25:50.640* :  sometimes I think they they're the only people in the world that feel that way and they discover
*25:50.640- 25:57.640* :  they're not alone Carolina Diaz here on the happy part we've been asking for your stories about
*25:57.640- 26:02.580* :  how going to live in a different country has made you happier now I know lots of people who've
