*01:19.040- 01:22.260* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:22.640- 01:27.600* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:27.600- 01:29.840* :  the 9th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:30.580- 01:34.700* :  The United States says it's reviewing other weapons deliveries to Israel after it
*01:34.700- 01:39.680* :  paused one shipment of arms as it tries to stave off any major Israeli offensive
*01:39.680- 01:44.800* :  on Raffa in the Gaza Strip. EU ambassadors have reached an agreement to use
*01:44.800- 01:48.920* :  the profits from frozen Russian assets to fund weapons for Ukraine.
*01:49.900- 01:53.380* :  Flood rescue efforts in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre
*01:53.460- 01:57.440* :  have been suspended because of more torrential rain and strong winds.
*02:00.620- 02:01.400* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:05.720- 02:10.120* :  orangutan diplomacy. Malaysia says it's going to start giving some of the critically
*02:10.120- 02:14.920* :  endangered animals as gifts to major buyers of its palm oil.
*02:19.600- 02:23.880* :  US officials have signaled to Israel that more arms shipments could be delayed
*02:23.880- 02:28.380* :  if the Israeli military pushes ahead with a full ground offensive in the southern
*02:28.380- 02:33.960* :  Gaza City of Raffa, where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting.
*02:34.700- 02:38.620* :  The US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on Wednesday that the Biden
*02:38.620- 02:45.160* :  Administration had paused to supply thousands of large powerful bombs to Israel over concerns
*02:45.160- 02:51.160* :  that it was about to launch a major offensive in Raffa and move the US strongly
*02:51.160- 02:56.520* :  opposes. Miss Austin told a Senate hearing it was still weighing up whether to withhold
*02:56.520- 03:05.140* :  other shipments. Our commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. As you've seen from the very
*03:05.140- 03:12.740* :  beginning, we have flowed billions of dollars of security assistance at very rapid pace
*03:12.940- 03:19.060* :  into Israel. And so we're going to continue to do what's necessary to ensure that Israel has a
*03:19.060- 03:25.340* :  means to defend itself. But that said, we are currently reviewing some near-term security
*03:25.340- 03:31.380* :  assistance shipments in the context of unfolding events in Raffa.
*03:32.200- 03:37.240* :  Israel's chief military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Higari, denied there was a rift with
*03:37.240- 03:43.680* :  Washington. The aid is unprecedented. The operational partnership is significant.
*03:44.460- 03:48.820* :  When there are disputes and there are, there are being resolved in closed rooms in a matter of
*03:48.840- 03:54.460* :  fact way. I spoke to our US State Department correspondent Tom Bateman. So how big a deal
*03:54.460- 03:59.420* :  is this announcement by the US? It's a big deal and it's unusual. I mean, you have to go back
*03:59.480- 04:04.940* :  a good sort of 40 years plus to find the last time that anything was done like this
*04:05.120- 04:10.600* :  at an early sort of publicly presented. This was said to have been done last week that a
*04:10.600- 04:17.000* :  consignment of headrock munitions, largely consisting of these 2,000-pound bombs. These are massive
*04:17.600- 04:24.000* :  bombs that are among the most powerful and destructive munitions that Western militaries have.
*04:24.000- 04:28.560* :  They are capable really of wiping out virtually entire neighborhoods, but you know, multiple
*04:28.560- 04:33.480* :  buildings at the same time. Israel's argument for using these kinds of things is that it has to
*04:33.480- 04:38.600* :  strike at Hamas, you know, below and above ground, but they've been widely criticised or their
*04:38.600- 04:43.980* :  use has been widely criticised by human rights groups in that they've been used frequently in Gaza.
*04:44.540- 04:48.820* :  So the Americans have picked these specifically and referenced the fact the way they've been
*04:48.820- 04:55.200* :  used by the Israelis in the past in Gaza and then saying, you know, as part of the US position,
*04:55.240- 05:00.820* :  which is that they don't want to see a full scale invasion of the city of Raffa by the Israelis.
*05:00.820- 05:07.040* :  That's why they've put a pause as they put it on a shipment of one consignment, but have said
*05:07.040- 05:14.200* :  at the same time today that they are also reviewing further weapons shipments. So this is all meant
*05:14.200- 05:19.800* :  as a shot across the Bows of Benjamin Netanyahu by the administration to try and prevent or
*05:19.800- 05:27.760* :  stave off a full scale invasion of Raffa. So the big question now is will Israel pay attention?
*05:27.760- 05:34.880* :  Will it hold back from a major offensive on Raffa? It's pretty bad. They're already though, isn't it?
*05:36.200- 05:39.240* :  Well, I think that's a really interesting question and it goes to the heart of, you know,
*05:39.240- 05:43.380* :  where the decision-making is being made, you know, in the Israeli government. Of course,
*05:43.980- 05:48.400* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu is, we've heard repeatedly that he said that even if there is a cease-fire
*05:48.400- 05:53.480* :  agreement or not, they will still go into Raffa. He says to eliminate the final battalions of Hamas
*05:53.480- 05:58.440* :  that they say are entrenched there. I think it's been interesting hearing the response of the
*05:58.440- 06:02.940* :  sort of military level in Israel today, which has been largely to sort of play this down to talk
*06:02.940- 06:07.780* :  about, you know, well, there are differences among allies and that's the way it goes. The Israelis
*06:08.040- 06:11.720* :  know, first of all, they didn't make much difference on the ground because they have the munitions,
*06:11.760- 06:18.020* :  they would need, they think, to carry out a full scale invasion of Raffa. So there's that practical
*06:18.060- 06:23.700* :  point, which is a very significant one. But in terms of the wider politics of this, yes, it is
*06:23.700- 06:28.960* :  the White House trying to put more pressure on the Netanyahu government. I mean, I do think that
*06:28.960- 06:33.440* :  sort of privately, you know, among American officials, there is a belief that the Israeli government
*06:33.440- 06:40.080* :  is relatively dysfunctional in terms of its decision-making because you have Mr. Netanyahu on the
*06:40.080- 06:47.320* :  one hand beholden to his far right ministers in his government who effectively keeping him in power.
*06:47.320- 06:52.420* :  He needs their support in the Israeli parliament to keep going. On the other hand, there are members
*06:52.420- 06:58.020* :  of the Israeli war cabinet like Benny Gantz, a former chief of the staff head of the Israeli army,
*06:58.860- 07:02.680* :  who are much, you know, appeared to be much more concerned about the relationship with the
*07:02.680- 07:09.100* :  Americans and what this means in terms of having this kind of schism. So I think that the pressures
*07:09.100- 07:14.940* :  are growing. The way out for everybody, of course, is a ceasefire agreement and that's why
*07:14.940- 07:20.100* :  fundamentally, I think the Biden administration is just doing everything it can to push that over
*07:20.100- 07:25.480* :  the line. Tom Bateman in Washington, and shortly after we spoke to Tom, and as we were about to
*07:25.480- 07:30.900* :  record this podcast, President Biden said that he would not supply weapons that Israel could use
*07:30.900- 07:37.240* :  to launch an all-out assault on Raffa. In an interview with CNN, he said civilians in Gaza have
*07:37.240- 07:42.720* :  been killed as a consequence of those bombs the US had sent to Israel, and that while America
*07:42.720- 07:48.500* :  would continue to give Israel the weapons it needs to defend itself, he would not send bombs or
*07:48.500- 07:54.820* :  artillery shells that could be used against innocent Palestinians. Well, despite the US concerns about
*07:54.820- 08:00.360* :  Raffa, Israeli forces are continuing to bomb areas in and around the overcrowded city.
*08:00.780- 08:06.320* :  Aid agency say the humanitarian situation there is deteriorating. Medical staff at one hospital
*08:06.320- 08:11.360* :  were forced to evacuate, along with their patients, and the World Health Organization says others
*08:11.360- 08:17.280* :  will soon run out of fuel, as Aid is not going into Gaza after the closure of two key
*08:17.280- 08:23.280* :  border crossings, despite Israel saying one of them has now been reopened. A security correspondent
*08:23.280- 08:28.960* :  Frank Gardner reports from Jerusalem. Israel's military operation in eastern Raffa is in full swing,
*08:28.960- 08:34.220* :  and it's making its allies, notably the United States, deeply concerned. Officially,
*08:34.220- 08:39.820* :  it's been framed as a limited operation, so not the full-scale ground offensive Washington said
*08:39.820- 08:45.300* :  it opposed, but there are still reports of civilian deaths. Seven members of one family were killed
*08:45.300- 08:50.820* :  in an airstrike, and Aid agencies are warning of a disastrous disruption to getting aid into the
*08:50.820- 08:56.640* :  territory. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Cabrillasus warns that humanitarian
*08:56.640- 09:03.960* :  operations risk grinding to a halt. We only have enough fuel to run health services in the south
*09:04.780- 09:11.780* :  for three more days. WHO has prepositioned some supplies in warehouses and hospitals,
*09:12.580- 09:19.260* :  but without more aid flowing into Gaza, we cannot sustain our life-saving support to hospitals.
*09:19.260- 09:25.540* :  Israel says it has reopened the crucial cargo crossing point at Karim Shalom. After a Hamas rocket
*09:25.540- 09:30.480* :  attack, they're killed four of its soldiers on Sunday. UN aid workers said today nothing was
*09:30.480- 09:34.820* :  getting through, though, due to fighting on the Gaza side of the border. The other main
*09:34.820- 09:40.120* :  crossing point at Raffa, on the border with Egypt, remains closed after Israeli forces seized
*09:40.120- 09:45.940* :  control of it, saying it was being used as a base by Hamas. Raffa is home to more than a million
*09:45.940- 09:51.240* :  people. Most of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza, crammed into a densely crowded
*09:51.240- 09:57.160* :  area, and meanwhile in Karim, mediation efforts continue to find a formula for a cease-fire that
*09:57.160- 10:01.820* :  satisfies both Hamas and Israel. To date, there is no sign of a breakthrough.
*10:03.020- 10:08.120* :  Frank Gardner. Raffa has been making international headlines after striking a deal with Britain
*10:08.120- 10:13.180* :  to take in some of its asylum seekers. The UK government insists Raffa under its long-time
*10:13.180- 10:18.680* :  ruler Paul Kagami is safe. A claim that's disputed by human rights groups, which say opponents
*10:18.680- 10:25.040* :  of Mr Kagami have suffered abusive prosecutions, enforced disappearances, or even died in suspicious
*10:25.920- 10:30.380* :  circumstances. Now, a random activist and critic of the president has said she intends to run
*10:30.380- 10:37.140* :  against him into lies election. Diane Rigara has barred from standing in 2017 and then imprisoned
*10:37.140- 10:42.820* :  for tax evasion and inciting insurrection. Charges she was then cleared of, which she says
*10:42.820- 10:49.020* :  were politically motivated. I asked that Africa regional editor Will Ross why, given all this,
*10:49.020- 10:54.360* :  she's decided to run again. She hasn't given away much information at the moment about
*10:54.360- 11:02.160* :  the motivation behind throwing her hat in the ring for July's election. She's just stated on
*11:02.160- 11:08.280* :  social media that she is going to run for president. We have to wait now and see if
*11:08.740- 11:18.000* :  her name will be accepted by the authorities. As you say, she has been in prison before on
*11:18.000- 11:24.000* :  several charges, but she was cleared of those charges. So on that count, she ought to be able to
*11:24.000- 11:31.940* :  run, but it's a very intriguing case. The whole Diane Rigara case, she was blocked from running
*11:31.940- 11:39.860* :  in 2017. So we've got no idea how many people would vote for her, but the whole family, her whole
*11:39.860- 11:49.980* :  family has had a terrible rift with the administration in Kigali. Ever since Diane Rigara's father died
*11:49.980- 11:58.620* :  in 2015, now the family believe that he was killed with the hand of the authorities, but the
*11:58.620- 12:04.180* :  government there says it was a traffic accident. And looking at previous elections, a lot of
*12:04.180- 12:10.600* :  observers would say she pretty much doesn't have any chance of winning, but this election in July,
*12:10.640- 12:14.260* :  I think, will be different from previous ones in that there'll be much more international
*12:14.360- 12:19.420* :  tension paid to it because of the British government's plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.
*12:20.060- 12:25.320* :  Well, yes, possibly. I mean, the spotlight has been on Rwanda because it's been in the news so
*12:25.320- 12:32.580* :  much, although not so much of a focus on domestic issues in Rwanda. But as you mentioned, you know,
*12:33.100- 12:38.580* :  she and everyone else will have no chance of winning in the last election in 2017.
*12:38.860- 12:47.700* :  Paul Kagami got nearly 99% of the votes. So many rights groups point to the oppression in the country,
*12:47.700- 12:53.460* :  the fact that criticism is not allowed. Any challenge that comes up to the government is crushed,
*12:53.500- 12:58.760* :  sometimes pretty brutally. The government denies any human rights atrocities.
*12:59.420- 13:04.200* :  But I think it'd be fair to say that Rwanda has its own kind of version of democracy.
*13:05.200- 13:11.200* :  Well, Ross, EU countries have agreed to use an estimated $3 billion in profits from frozen
*13:11.200- 13:16.920* :  Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine. The deal was struck by the bloc's 27 ambassadors
*13:17.440- 13:21.640* :  after a dispute about taxation was resolved, and he Cardwell reports.
*13:21.880- 13:27.460* :  The Russian central bank assets are currently being held mainly in a Belgian-based clearinghouse,
*13:27.460- 13:33.860* :  generating more than $3 billion a year in interest. The financial assets were frozen after
*13:33.860- 13:39.560* :  the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there's been a fierce debate about what to do with
*13:39.560- 13:45.140* :  them ever since. Moscow has threatened the West with a severe response and an endless legal
*13:45.140- 13:51.560* :  challenges if the money is touched. Earlier this year, the EU agreed to use the interest generated,
*13:51.560- 13:58.660* :  but many countries were unhappy about the 25% taxes and fees that Belgium would collect on the money.
*13:58.660- 14:03.760* :  Diplomatic sources say Belgium has now agreed to donate the taxes to Ukraine.
*14:04.800- 14:10.720* :  Nikki Cardwell, a man identified as a Russian spy, is to be expelled from the UK as part of a
*14:10.720- 14:16.760* :  wave of new restrictions on Russian activity. Several diplomatic properties run from Moscow are also
*14:16.760- 14:21.900* :  being closed. The British Interior Minister or Home Secretary James Cleverley made the announcement
*14:21.900- 14:27.480* :  in Parliament, as our security correspondent Gordon Carrera reports. The package of measures is
*14:27.480- 14:32.800* :  designed to send a signal to Moscow that its recent actions around Europe are unacceptable.
*14:33.480- 14:39.620* :  The so-called malign activity in the UK includes individuals arrested on national security charges
*14:39.620- 14:45.560* :  and cyberhacking. The Home Secretary also referred to plans for sabotage in Germany and Poland,
*14:45.560- 14:51.720* :  linked to support for Ukraine, and even the jamming of GPS signals used to guide commercial aviation.
*14:52.440- 14:55.320* :  James Cleverley outlined the government's response in the comments.
*14:55.600- 15:03.500* :  We will expel the Russian defence attache, who is an undeclared military intelligence officer.
*15:04.140- 15:09.560* :  We will remove diplomatic premises status from several Russian owned properties in the UK,
*15:10.360- 15:15.380* :  including Seacock's House, a Russian owned property in Sussex, and the Trade and Defence
*15:15.380- 15:20.320* :  section in Highgate, which we believe have been used for intelligence purposes.
*15:20.320- 15:25.680* :  The Russian defence attache is normally a member of the GRU Russian military intelligence,
*15:25.680- 15:31.360* :  but he was one of a small number of spies left in place to offer a channel of communication.
*15:31.420- 15:36.500* :  His expulsion, as well as the loss of the premises, will cause anger in Moscow.
*15:37.120- 15:38.560* :  It has promised a response.
*15:39.400- 15:40.220* :  Gordon Carrera
*15:41.280- 15:46.540* :  China has pandered diplomacy. Now, in a controversial move, Malaysia says it's going to introduce
*15:46.820- 15:47.980* :  orangutan diplomacy.
*15:52.860- 15:58.520* :  The plan is to send these critically endangered animals to any country that buys large amounts
*15:58.520- 16:03.820* :  of Malaysian palm oil. It's found in many of the products that we eat and use, and critics say
*16:03.820- 16:09.620* :  that the forests where orangutans live are being chopped down to make way for palm oil plantations.
*16:10.420- 16:15.280* :  But Malaysia says giving orangutans as gifts to nations that buy its palm oil
*16:15.580- 16:19.180* :  will prove its commitment to conservation and biodiversity.
*16:19.260- 16:22.640* :  Asia-Pacific editor Nikki Bristo told us more.
*16:23.160- 16:29.120* :  This was a statement made. The statement about the plan was given by the plantations and commodities
*16:29.120- 16:35.480* :  minister. He gave general outlines, for example, the broad idea that orangutans will be given
*16:36.060- 16:40.200* :  to nations, major nations, which trade with Malaysia for palm oil.
*16:40.300- 16:44.620* :  Talking about countries like India, countries in the European Union and China.
*16:45.160- 16:49.260* :  But he didn't say exactly where these orangutans would come from, whether they would be taking
*16:49.260- 16:55.720* :  from the wild or ones already in captivity, when they were given what the terms of giving them
*16:55.720- 17:01.320* :  would be, any details like that. He just essentially outlined the plan and explained why they were
*17:01.320- 17:07.300* :  doing it. And essentially what he said in Malaysia wanted to do was show that as well as developing
*17:07.300- 17:12.520* :  its economy and palm oil plantations in particular, though the government was also concerned about
*17:12.520- 17:19.120* :  preserving natural habitats and the places where orangutans live, you know, orangutans have become
*17:19.120- 17:26.440* :  a real symbol of man's battle against nature. So he believes this is a way for people to understand
*17:26.440- 17:31.060* :  that Malaysia series about protecting them. I think a lot of people will struggle to understand
*17:31.060- 17:38.160* :  the logic of that because he's talking about sending orangutans a road possibly being separated
*17:38.160- 17:44.400* :  from their families to other countries where they'll be kept in zoos. What are wildlife groups
*17:44.400- 17:50.000* :  saying about this? Yeah, I mean, that's exactly right. It does seem slightly logical. In fact,
*17:50.000- 17:55.400* :  wildlife groups, WWF have already come out and spoken about this. And he said essentially
*17:56.160- 18:01.860* :  that it would be better to keep orangutans in the places where they live and protect their
*18:01.860- 18:07.740* :  natural habitats, to protect the London forests where they live mostly on the island of Borneo,
*18:07.740- 18:14.360* :  which is divided mostly between Indonesia and Malaysia. Better to keep them there,
*18:14.360- 18:19.520* :  rather than sending them off as gifts elsewhere. So from a conservation point of view,
*18:19.520- 18:26.700* :  there doesn't seem to be a lot of logic in this, but of course, there is a political motive
*18:26.700- 18:33.260* :  and the minister who announces plan. He mentioned the fact that China does this kind of thing with
*18:33.280- 18:40.320* :  pandas. They act as a kind of soft power ambassador for China all over the world. China sends a
*18:40.320- 18:45.880* :  panda to a zoo in another country. People flock there. They have a slightly warmer feeling about
*18:45.880- 18:52.300* :  China and he hopes that sending these orangutans a road will have a similar reason. So it seems
*18:52.300- 18:57.600* :  it's more political than anything to do with conservation. Mickey Bristo.
*19:00.560- 19:07.140* :  Still to come. I looked at it clearly marked down one edge. I thought at first it was some kind of
*19:07.140- 19:13.800* :  calendar. So what archaeological treasure did a teacher find in his English garden? We'll tell you

*20:18.900- 20:24.180* :  Brazil. Rescue efforts in the city of Porto Alegre, which is experiencing the worst flooding in
*20:24.180- 20:30.260* :  its history, have been suspended because of torrential rains and strong winds. At least 100 people
*20:30.260- 20:34.420* :  are known to have died in the floods and landslides across the state of Rio Grande de Sol,
*20:34.420- 20:40.740* :  and at least 150,000 have been forced to leave their homes. The governor of the state has announced
*20:40.740- 20:45.880* :  the deployment of an extra thousand police and security officers to stop looting and crime
*20:45.880- 20:51.180* :  in badly affected areas and has called for more help from the central government.
*20:51.900- 20:55.960* :  Fabian, who lives in Santa Maria City, says assistance is desperately needed.
*20:56.700- 21:04.660* :  We had in 10 days an amount of 500 millimeters of rain and that amount of water was expected
*21:04.660- 21:14.400* :  in two months. We had roads, bridges and houses, countless of houses, thousands of houses destroyed
*21:14.400- 21:19.400* :  by the water. Long story short, we are facing a post-war scenario.
*21:20.640- 21:26.460* :  BBC Brazil's Leandro Prasera is in the capital of Brazilia. He explained to James Reynolds why
*21:26.460- 21:30.560* :  the authorities have warned people not to return to some of the worst affected areas.
*21:31.140- 21:35.740* :  They've also been told to stay away from the La Goa dos Patos, which is the biggest lagoon
*21:35.740- 21:41.420* :  in South America. There is a fear that this massive amount of water is going down the river
*21:41.660- 21:48.220* :  and is going to affect the city around this lagoon right now. It's estimated that 1.4 million
*21:48.220- 21:54.160* :  people were affected by the floods and at least 6,000 people are now in shelters.
*21:54.780- 21:56.700* :  What is the central government saying where you are?
*21:57.140- 22:01.780* :  Well, what the central government is trying to say right now is that the central government
*22:01.780- 22:07.780* :  is taking all measures in order to help the local state. It's important to note that Brazil
*22:07.780- 22:14.680* :  is a federation, so the central government helps the local government in Rio Grande do-Josu.
*22:15.100- 22:22.360* :  So the military has been taken place, there are flights, transporting water, food and
*22:22.360- 22:27.980* :  support equipment. What else are people saying? People are mostly concerned right now with the
*22:27.980- 22:33.460* :  impact and the short term and also in the long term. In the short term, there is also this
*22:33.740- 22:38.600* :  concern of violence a few days ago. The people who were helping the authorities in the
*22:38.600- 22:45.100* :  rescue operation started to report crimes such as robbery and even stealing of jatskees
*22:45.340- 22:50.820* :  since then local and federal authorities are trying to reinforce the security in the most
*22:50.820- 22:57.700* :  affected areas. The other major concern is with food, water and health. It's important to know
*22:57.700- 23:03.960* :  that all this water might be contaminated somehow and there are concerns over the impact of
*23:04.640- 23:10.280* :  this goods and the health of the population and it's also it's unknown the number of people who
*23:10.280- 23:16.980* :  have lost their lives during this strategy. Leandro Prezeiro is in Brazilia. The Chinese
*23:16.980- 23:21.720* :  President Xi Jinping has arrived in Hungary on the third and final leg of his visit to Europe
*23:21.720- 23:27.260* :  before that he was in Serbia where he was greeted warmly by President Alexander Vuchich
*23:27.560- 23:32.460* :  and he was also given a red carpet welcome in France despite concerns that China might be on
*23:32.460- 23:38.240* :  the brink of a trade war with the EU. Unlike other EU nations and like Serbia the Hungarian
*23:38.240- 23:43.700* :  government has welcomed deepening economic ties with China while maintaining friendly relations
*23:43.700- 23:49.660* :  with Moscow. From Budapest, Nick Thor sent this report. In the message to the people of Hungary
*23:49.660- 23:55.400* :  published in the main pro-government daily modern nemset the Chinese president flattered his hosts.
*23:56.000- 24:02.460* :  Sino-Hungarian friendship he wrote is like a good Tokai wine, fragrant sweet rich and long
*24:02.460- 24:09.260* :  lasting. In trade terms, Hungary is an important gateway for China into the big automobile markets
*24:09.260- 24:16.260* :  of the EU. One possibly two big electric car factories are planned here which will help China
*24:16.560- 24:23.240* :  circumvent threatened EU import tariffs. Major electric vehicle battery factories are already
*24:23.240- 24:29.260* :  operating under construction and planned. For Viktor Orbán's Hungarian government this is an
*24:29.260- 24:35.380* :  opportunity to show off those investments and point out to Brussels and his fellow EU members
*24:35.860- 24:42.700* :  how advantageous good relations with Beijing can be. Nick Thorpe, for more on President Xi's visit
*24:42.700- 24:47.780* :  to Budapest and its financial implications, Ed Butler spoke to Zoltan Pogatser, a Hungarian
*24:47.780- 24:53.680* :  political economist and lecturer at the University of West Hungary. Most of the Western world has
*24:53.680- 25:00.180* :  been taking part in this process of decoupling from China. Hungary has chosen a very different path.
*25:00.180- 25:06.940* :  I think Hungary in recent years has very consciously opted out of this decoupling process and has
*25:07.260- 25:13.380* :  continued to even intensify its economic relationship and political relationship with China.
*25:13.380- 25:20.300* :  China is a major investor in Hungary and Hungary is trying to be a supporter to China
*25:20.760- 25:27.300* :  but the relationship is at the moment rather one sided. It's mostly Chinese investments and Chinese
*25:27.300- 25:35.940* :  exports to Hungary and in recent years this has basically taken a leap forward with very massive
*25:35.940- 25:43.060* :  investments in the automotive sector in electric vehicles and in battery production.
*25:43.400- 25:49.740* :  Yes, something like I was seeing loans up to a hundred billion dollars worth coming
*25:50.540- 25:55.780* :  to Hungary from China in the last 20 years or so. It seems like a very large number compared to
*25:56.180- 26:02.200* :  other central European countries. I mean, what is the factory that's being planned that we know
*26:02.200- 26:08.900* :  is to be built making EVs, Chinese EVs in Hungary? Actually, we're talking about more than one
*26:08.900- 26:15.920* :  factory. BYD has already announced that they will be building a plant in the southern Hungarian
*26:15.920- 26:24.620* :  city of Seged. C-A-T-L, which is a major battery producer. It will be the biggest plant
*26:24.620- 26:30.360* :  making batteries in all of Europe. This will be in Debrecen, which is in East Hungary.
*26:31.140- 26:37.480* :  And there is a suspicion that Great Wall Motors, which is another electric vehicle maker,
*26:38.020- 26:44.980* :  will announce during the visit of President Xi Jinping to Hungary, yet another plant, which will
*26:44.980- 26:51.340* :  be in peace, which is in South Western Hungary. I mean, it's amazing, isn't it? All of these
*26:51.340- 26:56.100* :  plants, that's all the Hungarian foreign minister, was castigating journalists for reporting on
*26:56.100- 27:02.700* :  this deal, potential deal. That's the Great Wall car company deal because the speculation was
*27:02.700- 27:08.080* :  against national interest, but I think there is this wider context to this, isn't there, that
*27:08.440- 27:14.820* :  as you say, whilst Hungary is allowing or inviting all of this huge investment and car making,
*27:15.260- 27:20.640* :  which must be great, I suppose, for Hungarian jobs and so on, it's happening at a time when the
*27:20.640- 27:27.480* :  rest of the EU seems to be pushing against the influx of Chinese electric vehicles.
*27:28.540- 27:34.900* :  From the Chinese side, the interest is definitely in manufacturing cars within the EU.
*27:35.220- 27:42.140* :  So if you export cars electric vehicles from China to the European Union, you face the threats
*27:42.140- 27:49.260* :  of having to pay huge customs duties, which the EU is about to introduce because of the competitive
*27:49.260- 27:55.040* :  advantage of Chinese electric cars and the generous state subsidies by the Chinese state.
*27:55.460- 28:01.100* :  But if you move some of this production into the European Union, Hungary being a member state of
*28:01.100- 28:08.860* :  the EU, your production in Hungary actually counts as European production from the internal market,
*28:08.860- 28:14.380* :  and therefore you're not facing any customs duties or quotas, which, of course, will,
*28:14.740- 28:19.260* :  it's basically a circumvention of the protectionist policies of the EU.
*28:19.820- 28:22.960* :  Zoltan Pogatser, a Hungarian political economist.
*28:23.840- 28:29.220* :  The pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca says it's withdrawing its COVID-19 vaccine worldwide.
*28:29.220- 28:33.860* :  A statement from the company said the decision was purely commercial as a jab had been
*28:33.860- 28:38.160* :  overtaken by updated vaccines targeting new variants of the virus.
*28:38.940- 28:43.580* :  However, there have been concerns about rare side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
*28:44.040- 28:47.440* :  James Menendez spoke to our health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson.
*28:48.100- 28:52.380* :  So is AstraZeneca right to say it's vaccine is out of date?
*28:53.120- 28:58.660* :  Many things have happened along the way. If you cast your mind back to 2020 when our only
*28:58.660- 29:06.060* :  protection from COVID-19 was social distancing, and then you come to the autumn of 2020,
*29:06.060- 29:10.500* :  and suddenly you've got these first vaccines, and AstraZeneca was one of them.
*29:10.800- 29:16.040* :  Now, since then, many things have happened along the road, including the fact that many of us
*29:16.040- 29:22.320* :  are now immune to COVID-19, and what the company is saying today is that it hasn't tweaked
*29:22.320- 29:26.780* :  its vaccine. It hasn't, it isn't up to date with the new variants that have come along,
*29:26.780- 29:32.360* :  and so it is less useful in the world. There is less demand for it. It wants to,
*29:32.980- 29:37.460* :  therefore, wind it down. And it says also that there's a surplus of other vaccines. In other words,
*29:37.500- 29:42.320* :  if people haven't got immunity, there's other places to go, right? Well, that's it really.
*29:42.320- 29:48.840* :  The Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, are still very much used in the world. But what happened
*29:48.840- 29:54.860* :  was that AstraZeneca was hailed as being a vaccine for the world when it was brought in in that
*29:54.860- 30:01.520* :  autumn of 2020. It was made in record time, 10 months instead of 10 years. It was cheaper than
*30:01.520- 30:06.020* :  the others. It was easier to store it. It didn't have to be stored at such low temperatures.
*30:06.720- 30:12.360* :  And it's estimated to have saved 6.5 million lives just here in the UK in its first year.
*30:12.980- 30:17.860* :  So it was hailed as a phenomenal success. But although it was safe for most people,
*30:17.860- 30:23.420* :  there is this tiny minority of people who suffer extremely serious side effects.
*30:23.420- 30:29.520* :  Yes, what was it? So this is blood clots caused by the vaccine. That's right. Extremely rare,
*30:29.520- 30:38.020* :  and it seems to occur in younger adults, particularly in men. And so in 2021, the European Union
*30:38.020- 30:44.080* :  got extremely concerned about this very small number of cases where patients had suffered
*30:44.080- 30:51.980* :  terrible side effects and died. And then in the UK in April 2021, it was banned for adults
*30:51.980- 30:57.440* :  under a certain age. And eventually, under the age of 40, adults were not given the AstraZeneca
*30:57.440- 31:04.240* :  vaccine in the end. It is linked to 73 deaths in the UK, but to put that in context out of nearly
*31:04.240- 31:10.780* :  50 million doses. So you can see that these are extremely rare side effects. But if they happen
*31:10.780- 31:16.640* :  to you, they can threaten your life. And there are a number of court cases with people claiming
*31:16.640- 31:22.400* :  to have been harmed by the vaccine. So all of this really goes into the mix, I guess.
*31:23.340- 31:28.320* :  Sophie Hutchinson. Now, it's not every day that you find an archaeological treasure in your
*31:28.320- 31:33.700* :  back garden, but that's what happened to 55-year-old geography teacher Graham Senior when he was
*31:33.700- 31:39.180* :  clearing weeds and stones at his home in Coventry in the English Midlands. Not far below the
*31:39.180- 31:45.300* :  surface of the soil, he came across a rectangular rock, about 11 centimeters or four inches long.
*31:45.860- 31:52.920* :  It's believed to be more than 1600 years old and is inscribed in a rare ancient language called
*31:52.920- 31:59.600* :  Ogham, also known as Oum. Tim Franks heard from the archaeologist Teresa Gilmore from Birmingham
*31:59.600- 32:05.620* :  Museums and first from Graham himself, who quite quickly realised he'd found something very special.
*32:06.440- 32:12.720* :  I looked at it, it clearly marked down one edge and it was far too regular a mark for it to have
*32:12.720- 32:17.860* :  been made by an animal or it for it to occur naturally. I thought at first it was some kind of
*32:17.860- 32:23.840* :  calendar. I think I remember sharing that with Teresa, but it turned out to be a script called
*32:23.840- 32:28.800* :  Ogham, which I'd never heard of before. At what point did people start getting very excited?
*32:29.380- 32:33.300* :  But I get the impression Teresa got quite excited, but not straight away.
*32:34.040- 32:37.520* :  Well, let's in that case bring Teresa in here.
*32:38.920- 32:44.840* :  Teresa, you're the the expert in all this. Tell me what your first contact with this stone was.
*32:45.520- 32:49.760* :  I think very cool to me to start with and said, I found this rock, I think it's calendar stone.
*32:50.520- 32:55.980* :  And I said, okay, send me some photos. And when the photos came through, I saw the markings
*32:55.980- 33:01.000* :  down the side and recognised that yes, they were regular, they'd be man-made, but it was of a
*33:01.020- 33:05.960* :  particular type of writing called Ogham. It's normally Irish style, but we don't get them
*33:06.040- 33:11.940* :  in the Midlands. They're normally kinds of over in Ireland, up in Scotland, down in Cornwall area.
*33:11.940- 33:18.180* :  When I thought it was Ogham, I sent it to Catherine Forsyth, up at Glasgow University, one of the
*33:18.180- 33:23.740* :  countries leading experts on Ogham and she pretty much confirmed very, very quickly that it was
*33:23.740- 33:29.260* :  definitely Ogham and it was a very important find. And how old do we think the stone is?
*33:29.760- 33:34.620* :  We think it's probably 56th century, but it could be as early as the 4th century.
*33:34.980- 33:37.220* :  And have you been able to read the script?
*33:38.160- 33:44.520* :  Catherine has done a translation and she's translated it as Mal-Dum-Kyle S-Lass.
*33:45.160- 33:51.340* :  So the first part of the inscription is actually someone's name, Mal-Dum-Kyle. The second part,
*33:51.340- 33:57.240* :  the S-Lass, we're still trying to interpret that. It might be a location of where the person's
*33:57.240- 34:00.740* :  from or it could be their occupation. We don't know at this point in time.
*34:01.260- 34:06.660* :  Were you aware that people from Ireland were travelling to this part of England?
*34:07.260- 34:12.580* :  Not really, so the fantastic thing about this is it's giving us more evidence in our archaeological
*34:12.580- 34:17.620* :  jigsaw puzzle of how people did move around the area and it's just showing how people are moving
*34:17.620- 34:22.620* :  from one country to another, how trade is happening and this case of how you're getting
*34:22.620- 34:28.040* :  different contacts. Teresa Gilmore from Birmingham Museums and teacher Graham Senior.
