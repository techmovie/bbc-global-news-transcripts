*00:50.180- 00:54.920* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:54.920- 00:56.260* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:56.680- 00:57.280* :  They said yes.
*00:57.280- 01:01.680* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*01:01.680- 01:04.040* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:27.760- 01:31.700* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Saturday, the 18th of May, these are our
*01:31.700- 01:32.480* :  main stories.
*01:33.100- 01:38.020* :  Israel says its forces in Gaza have recovered the bodies of three Israelis abducted from
*01:38.020- 01:41.480* :  a music festival during the Hamas attacks last October.
*01:41.660- 01:47.700* :  Gunman in Afghanistan have killed three foreign nationals and an Afghan in the city of Bamyan.
*01:48.220- 01:53.660* :  President Zelensky of Ukraine has signed new laws to try to boost army recruitment in
*01:53.660- 01:56.020* :  the face of growing military pressure from Russia.
*01:58.380- 02:03.440* :  Also in this podcast, a crisis in Cuba's sugar industry and its knock-on effects.
*02:04.080- 02:04.740* :  It's a disaster.
*02:04.960- 02:08.840* :  Today, the Cuba industry in Cuba almost doesn't exist.
*02:09.280- 02:14.660* :  Was the locomotive for the rest of the economy for more than 150 years.
*02:18.880- 02:25.660* :  When Hamas attacked Israel seven months ago, about 1,200 people were killed, a further
*02:25.660- 02:28.700* :  252 were taken back to Gaza as hostages.
*02:29.380- 02:34.300* :  Now Israel says its military forces have retrieved the bodies of three of the people who were
*02:34.300- 02:36.940* :  at the Novo Music Festival on October 7th.
*02:37.240- 02:39.740* :  Daniel Hagari is spokesman for the IDF.
*02:40.360- 02:45.900* :  According to the credible information that we have gathered, Shani Luk, Amid Busquila
*02:46.220- 02:52.160* :  and its Khagleran tale, were murdered by Hamas while escaping the Novo Music Festival
*02:52.160- 02:56.000* :  on October 7th, and their bodies were taken into Gaza.
*02:56.620- 03:04.120* :  They were celebrating life in the Novo Music Festival, and they were murdered by Hamas.
*03:04.740- 03:07.880* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, told Ismul.
*03:08.300- 03:14.620* :  The Israeli military has not released details on where and how the three bodies were found,
*03:15.460- 03:21.900* :  but Daniel Hagari said that there was credible information that all three had been murdered
*03:22.460- 03:29.540* :  by Hamas during the awful events that surrounded the Novo Music Festival on October 7th.
*03:30.040- 03:35.300* :  Now we already knew that Shani Luk had been confirmed dead, indeed at the end of October,
*03:35.860- 03:41.380* :  after a piece of her skull was identified, and it was determined that she could not possibly
*03:41.780- 03:42.380* :  have survived.
*03:43.060- 03:50.500* :  The other two hostages, Amid Busquila and Itsak Gelanter, it was hoped that both of those two
*03:50.500- 03:56.380* :  were still alive, and I think this just goes to the heart of the agony that the families
*03:56.380- 04:01.300* :  of the hostages have been going through the past seven months, not knowing from one day
*04:01.300- 04:05.460* :  to the next whether their loved ones are alive, and just clinging to the hope that they are.
*04:06.000- 04:09.880* :  And this also highlights, of course, that the longer this goes on as some of the hostages
*04:09.880- 04:13.860* :  families have been saying, and they've taken their message to the streets of Israel,
*04:14.480- 04:18.060* :  the bleak of the chances of their loved ones surviving become.
*04:18.800- 04:23.500* :  And what sort of reaction has there been within Israel to the news that these three bodies
*04:23.760- 04:24.480* :  have been recovered?
*04:24.840- 04:30.380* :  Well we've had a statement from the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that the
*04:30.380- 04:35.740* :  loss was heartbreaking, and he said that we will return all our hostages both the living
*04:36.300- 04:36.940* :  and the dead.
*04:37.080- 04:41.920* :  And I think this will be an evening, it's the Sabbath, the news came after the start
*04:41.920- 04:45.200* :  of the Sabbath, so everyone has kind of gone home for the weekend.
*04:45.700- 04:51.540* :  This will cast a very heavy shadow over the weekend, and I think you can expect the whole
*04:51.540- 04:55.800* :  country to feel pretty somber about this, even as the war grinds on.
*04:56.340- 04:57.980* :  That was Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*04:58.440- 05:03.400* :  Meanwhile, the Israeli military says it has engaged in intense fighting in the Jabbalia
*05:03.400- 05:08.740* :  area of northern Gaza, which it had previously claimed was mostly cleared of Hamas fighters.
*05:09.500- 05:14.740* :  Tanks supported by fighter jets and drones are said to be confronting Hamas both above
*05:14.740- 05:21.060* :  ground and in tunnels with fierce battles taking place deep inside the Jabbalia refugee camp.
*05:21.680- 05:24.500* :  The army claims to have killed more than 200 gunmen.
*05:25.040- 05:30.300* :  There has also been continued fighting in and around Rafa City in the far south of Gaza,
*05:30.900- 05:33.880* :  where thousands of civilians are continuing to flee.
*05:34.500- 05:39.360* :  Three Spanish tourists and an Afghan citizen have been killed in a gun attack in the city
*05:39.360- 05:41.180* :  of Bamyan in central Afghanistan.
*05:42.160- 05:47.840* :  Several other people, including foreign citizens, were reportedly wounded when two gunmen opened
*05:47.840- 05:50.700* :  fire on a vehicle in the city's central market.
*05:51.300- 05:53.540* :  From Afghanistan, his Caroline Davis.
*05:54.360- 05:58.440* :  Early reports of the attack were confirmed by a spokesperson for the Taliban government
*05:58.440- 05:59.420* :  on Friday night.
*05:59.960- 06:03.780* :  In a statement, he said that the shooting was against the public and that there were further
*06:03.780- 06:06.680* :  foreigners and Afghans also injured in the incident.
*06:07.360- 06:11.920* :  Security forces are currently trying to find the killers and four people have been arrested.
*06:12.600- 06:16.720* :  One eyewitness told the BBC that the attackers were two people in a car.
*06:17.080- 06:20.440* :  Images of the scene show several bodies lying in the street.
*06:20.720- 06:21.540* :  Caroline Davis.
*06:22.480- 06:28.460* :  President Zelensky has signed two new laws to boost army recruitment as Ukraine struggles
*06:28.460- 06:29.740* :  to mobilize fighters.
*06:30.280- 06:35.120* :  Some prisoners will be allowed to join the military and fines have gone up for men ignoring
*06:35.120- 06:36.140* :  the order to fight.
*06:36.800- 06:43.380* :  From Saturday, all men between 18 and 60 will have to update their details using a new
*06:43.380- 06:44.740* :  Defence Ministry app.
*06:44.740- 06:47.720* :  Janna Bespiatchuk reports from Kiev.
*06:48.340- 06:54.500* :  Ukraine's long anticipated mobilization law won't change anything for those who have
*06:54.500- 06:59.640* :  been fighting for over two years with little break or chance to see their families.
*07:00.420- 07:05.180* :  This law doesn't allow them to leave the army until the end of the war.
*07:06.120- 07:11.000* :  However, the Ukrainian authorities hope that it will allow them to boost mobilization
*07:11.000- 07:18.400* :  and help those on the front line by lowering the minimum conscription age to 25 and by increasing
*07:18.400- 07:20.600* :  fines for draft evasion.
*07:21.380- 07:25.840* :  Almost a week now, Russian troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in the Kharkiv
*07:25.840- 07:27.140* :  region of Ukraine.
*07:27.740- 07:32.880* :  President Putin says the aim is to create what he's calling a buffer zone to protect Russian
*07:33.080- 07:33.780* :  border regions.
*07:34.320- 07:37.880* :  The Russians have already captured a number of villages and are threatening to take the
*07:37.880- 07:39.100* :  town of Vovchansk.
*07:39.620- 07:44.100* :  But for now, President Putin says he has no plans to capture the city of Kharkiv.
*07:44.540- 07:47.360* :  He made his comments at the end of his state visit to China.
*07:51.520- 07:56.580* :  As for what is happening on the Kharkiv axis, it is also the Ukrainians' fault, because
*07:56.580- 08:02.160* :  they shalt and unfortunately continue shelling residential areas of border territories,
*08:02.660- 08:03.680* :  including Belgorod.
*08:04.280- 08:09.260* :  They fire directly at the center of the town directly at the residential areas.
*08:09.940- 08:16.420* :  And I said publicly, if it continues, we will have to create a safety zone, a buffer zone,
*08:17.060- 08:21.100* :  because for capturing Kharkiv, we currently have no such plans.
*08:22.540- 08:25.640* :  So the fighting in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine continues.
*08:26.040- 08:30.140* :  Our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel has sent this report from the frontline.
*08:31.160- 08:34.240* :  We're driving at speed towards the village of Lipsi.
*08:35.020- 08:39.380* :  Now under siege, we're just passing destroyed villages.
*08:40.460- 08:45.980* :  This was from the last time Russia occupied this area, threatening to do the same again.
*08:46.700- 08:51.320* :  And we are driving forward to a Ukrainian national guard position where they're operating
*08:51.320- 08:56.120* :  their drones, trying to destroy Russian targets, trying to stop their advance.
*08:58.700- 09:02.440* :  And as soon as you get out of here, let's follow him.
*09:05.480- 09:07.000* :  He's been told to follow him.
*09:13.380- 09:15.720* :  He's run past a smoldering glaze.
*09:16.520- 09:19.920* :  The Russians have recently fired grad rockets near their position.
*09:21.500- 09:26.220* :  Just walking into the bunker where they clearly got their control room for the drones.
*09:27.840- 09:32.080* :  A few soldiers looking at a drone feed.
*09:33.780- 09:38.440* :  Hello, just a week ago, Andrei and his men were fighting further east.
*09:39.200- 09:43.680* :  But now they've been charged with halting the Russian's advancing Kharkiv.
*09:47.460- 09:49.340* :  The situation is dynamic, tense.
*09:49.340- 09:51.400* :  It is hard to predict anything.
*09:52.060- 09:56.920* :  I understand why they want to pull our forces from defence lines of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
*09:57.780- 09:59.400* :  It was just a question of time.
*10:00.120- 10:02.220* :  The Russians always use mean tactics.
*10:05.560- 10:08.720* :  As we talk, they spot more Russian troops on the move.
*10:10.420- 10:15.080* :  Right now we can't show you this picture, but our pilot has just found out the moment
*10:15.080- 10:17.160* :  of the enemy group to our positions.
*10:19.700- 10:20.460* :  There's a concern.
*10:20.980- 10:22.040* :  They're about to be attacked.
*10:22.380- 10:25.760* :  This is where they're directing artillery fire, they're telling us to get out.
*10:25.760- 10:29.440* :  We've said this area is under threat, and we're going to go.
*10:36.180- 10:42.860* :  Further from the front at a field hospital, Victor is the latest Ukrainian casualty of
*10:42.860- 10:44.360* :  this latest Russian assault.
*10:44.900- 10:47.420* :  He's lost some fingers in a mortar explosion.
*10:48.100- 10:53.360* :  The Russians too are taking heavy casualties, but Victor says they are many.
*10:56.400- 10:58.620* :  Our guys are constantly fighting off attacks.
*10:59.380- 11:02.380* :  Sabotage and reconnaissance groups come there all the time.
*11:02.900- 11:04.060* :  There are a lot of them there.
*11:04.860- 11:08.500* :  They're not just that numbered, they're also have gunned.
*11:10.980- 11:15.500* :  They have everything, whatever they want, and we have nothing to fight with, but we do
*11:15.500- 11:16.080* :  what we can.
*11:20.020- 11:20.720* :  That's out, guys.
*11:21.880- 11:23.500* :  Just arrived at the artillery position.
*11:25.960- 11:30.840* :  At a Ukrainian artillery position outside the town of Volvchansk, they're clearing out
*11:30.840- 11:36.680* :  to use shells from their Russian made self-propelled gun, waiting for the arrival of more.
*11:37.560- 11:39.400* :  They soon come in a small van.
*11:41.120- 11:46.940* :  This unit too has been redirected from another part of the front, stretching and thinning
*11:46.940- 11:47.920* :  their defences.
*11:48.700- 11:52.320* :  Reinforcements are making a difference, but at what cost elsewhere?
*11:52.720- 11:57.540* :  And Mikhailo, the artillery commander, wonders if this could have been avoided.
*11:58.420- 12:03.280* :  We could have built some kind of fortification and lost less human lives, fewer villages.
*12:04.060- 12:07.300* :  Now we'll have to fight it all back, we'll now need to use more resources.
*12:07.820- 12:12.080* :  We could have used logs and concrete, now we'll have to use shells and people to take
*12:12.080- 12:12.940* :  this land back.
*12:13.920- 12:18.420* :  One year ago, Ukraine hoped it would be taking back its land in an offensive.
*12:19.520- 12:22.640* :  Now, it's simply hoping it can hold the line.
*12:23.480- 12:28.980* :  A man who broke into the California home of Nancy Pelosi nearly two years ago and attacked
*12:28.980- 12:35.000* :  her husband Paul with a hammer has been sentenced to 30 years in prison, as Pelosi was speaker
*12:35.000- 12:38.740* :  of the U.S. House of Representatives at the time, Nomiya Igbal reports.
*12:39.300- 12:43.400* :  David DePap broke into the Pelosi's home in October 2022.
*12:44.240- 12:48.120* :  During his trial, he took to the stand in his own defence and admitted to it.
*12:48.680- 12:54.180* :  Jura's heard how DePap had been driven by far-right conspiracy theories and had initially planned
*12:54.180- 12:58.960* :  to target Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who at the time was second in line to the presidency.
*12:59.600- 13:01.740* :  She wasn't at home the night of the attack.
*13:02.420- 13:07.360* :  In a letter to the judge ahead of sentencing, Paul Pelosi said his skull fractures and injuries
*13:07.360- 13:09.000* :  have continued to affect him.
*13:09.640- 13:10.400* :  Nomiya Igbal
*13:11.380- 13:16.760* :  Cubans are endearing some of their bleakest economic times since the Cold War amid worsening
*13:16.760- 13:22.600* :  inflation, a scarcity of basic goods, and the decades-long U.S. economic embargo.
*13:23.460- 13:28.840* :  In an unexpected move, the country's economy minister Alejandro Chilfanandez was arrested
*13:28.840- 13:30.160* :  in March for corruption.
*13:30.840- 13:35.660* :  But many think it will take more than one ministerial casualty to pull Cuba from its economic
*13:35.660- 13:36.320* :  woes.
*13:36.680- 13:41.440* :  Our correspondent, Will Grant, travelled to the heartland of one of Cuba's most quintessential
*13:41.440- 13:45.100* :  industries, sugar, to see how tough the situation has become.
*13:47.360- 13:52.640* :  The men of the Yamuri Sugar Union have worked the cane fields around Sien Fuegos since they
*13:52.640- 13:54.280* :  were old enough to wield a machete.
*13:55.020- 14:01.780* :  Its tough, thankless work with aging Soviet-euro-technology made harder by decades of U.S. sanctions.
*14:02.860- 14:08.200* :  There is part of the island's DNA, but as this year's sugar cane harvest draws down,
*14:08.200- 14:10.900* :  the industry is facing near-total collapse.
*14:13.760- 14:18.900* :  There's not enough trucks and the fuel shortages mean sometimes we can't work for days as
*14:18.900- 14:20.580* :  cane cutter Miguel Guzman.
*14:21.560- 14:26.900* :  As inflation and scarcity worsen, Miguel's low wages barely buy him anything anymore.
*14:29.920- 14:35.440* :  To you that Caracas, a 19th century sugar mill near Sien Fuegos, is humid and noisy.
*14:35.460- 14:38.700* :  Its air thick with the overpowering smell of molasses.
*14:39.640- 14:44.500* :  Running on rusting, obsolete technology, it is one of only two dozen working mills on
*14:44.500- 14:44.980* :  the island.
*14:45.800- 14:52.360* :  Cuba must now import sugar to meet domestic demand, once unthinkable and a far cry from
*14:52.360- 14:57.640* :  the glory days when Cuban sugar was the envy of the Caribbean and exported around the world.
*15:01.620- 15:04.980* :  The problems in sugar aren't only the fault of the U.S. in Bargo.
*15:05.500- 15:10.720* :  Years of chronic mismanagement and underinvestment have also wrecked the once thriving industry.
*15:11.680- 15:16.580* :  Today sugar receives less than 3% of state investment, as the Cuban government has backed
*15:16.580- 15:19.460* :  tourism as its key economic motor instead.
*15:19.780- 15:20.420* :  It's a disaster.
*15:20.420- 15:24.720* :  Today the fuel industry in Cuba almost doesn't exist.
*15:25.200- 15:29.020* :  The country anaries from the center for studies of the Cuban economy in Havana.
*15:29.360- 15:34.280* :  He says the issues with sugar are affecting other important industries in Cuba, like its
*15:34.280- 15:35.000* :  rum trade.
*15:35.420- 15:39.420* :  This industry had really a very important role in the Cuban economy.
*15:40.140- 15:45.540* :  Was the locomotive for the rest of the economy for more than 150 years.
*15:45.980- 15:47.160* :  And we lose some cylinder.
*15:51.140- 15:54.780* :  One man who can get his hands on enough sugar is Martin Nisarani.
*15:55.000- 16:00.260* :  Part of a new breed of Cuban private entrepreneurs, his company produces yogurt and ice cream.
*16:02.840- 16:07.960* :  As he shows me around the factory outside Havana, he says he hopes to double production soon.
*16:07.980- 16:11.880* :  The business has been hailed by the Cuban president as a model for the future.
*16:12.700- 16:16.780* :  It may still be a dirty word for the Cuban state, but this is capitalism.
*16:17.200- 16:22.240* :  Pure and simple, no matter how much the businessmen behind it display their revolutionary credentials.
*16:23.240- 16:27.660* :  I put it to him that only people with close links to the Cuban Communist Party are able
*16:27.660- 16:30.920* :  to start a private business as sophisticated as his.
*16:33.720- 16:35.160* :  I'm not an employee of the Cuban state.
*16:35.980- 16:37.340* :  I'm a non-state means of production.
*16:37.960- 16:42.180* :  The state treats me like just another private entrepreneur, with no special privileges whatsoever.
*16:48.860- 16:52.800* :  None of this bodes well for Cuban sugar or its long-suffering workers.
*16:53.600- 16:57.000* :  There's a saying in Cuba, without sugar there's no country.
*16:59.080- 17:02.140* :  Already its sugar processing plants are barely operational.
*17:02.640- 17:06.620* :  Cuba's once important and profitable trade is now a ghost industry.
*17:07.560- 17:11.840* :  We'll grant in Cuba still to come.
*17:12.100- 17:19.220* :  You go from the very sort of private, personal moments to the most official possible moment,
*17:19.220- 17:20.560* :  such as the coronation.
*17:21.000- 17:26.380* :  An exhibition of royal portraits illustrating the power of photography over the last century.
*17:34.480- 17:35.200* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*17:35.200- 17:39.900* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*17:39.900- 17:41.260* :  prices due to inflation.
*17:41.660- 17:42.280* :  They said yes.
*17:42.700- 17:46.680* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those honorists to your contracts,
*17:46.680- 17:50.800* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about, you insane Hollywood s**t?
*17:50.900- 17:55.640* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15
*17:55.640- 17:56.240* :  a month.
*17:56.460- 17:58.860* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*17:59.000- 18:01.600* :  $45 a month from 3 months plus taxes and fees, promoting for new customers for limited
*18:01.600- 18:04.340* :  time, unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month, so it's full turns at MintMobile.com.
*18:04.840- 18:08.280* :  Have a catch yourself eating the same flavorless dinner three days in a row.
*18:08.700- 18:09.640* :  Dreaming of something better?
*18:09.980- 18:14.760* :  Well, hello fresh is your guilt-free dream come true baby, is me, Gigi Palmer.
*18:15.260- 18:20.340* :  Let's wake up those taste buds with hot juicy pecan crusted chicken, our garlic butter
*18:20.340- 18:23.500* :  shrimp scampi, eh, hello fresh.
*18:24.820- 18:29.620* :  Have dreaming of all the delicious possibilities and dig in at hellofresh.com.
*18:30.340- 18:31.940* :  Let's get this dinner party started.
*18:39.220- 18:44.300* :  A mass wedding was due to take place in Nigeria next week involving a hundred girls and young
*18:44.300- 18:44.660* :  women.
*18:45.280- 18:50.220* :  Many are orphans whose parents were killed by kidnapping gangs that roam northern Nigeria.
*18:50.980- 18:56.460* :  Such ceremonies are not uncommon but have sparked outrage in the West African nation over
*18:56.460- 18:59.040* :  concerns that some of the girls might be underage.
*18:59.660- 19:04.680* :  A human rights group concerned Nigerian citizens has launched a petition to try to stop
*19:04.680- 19:05.340* :  the practice.
*19:06.020- 19:11.960* :  John Donnerson spoke to Udru Kennedy Ohanenye, Nigeria's minister of women's affairs, who's
*19:11.960- 19:15.520* :  prompted an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the ceremony.
*19:16.140- 19:21.960* :  Since I came in as a minister I'm not aware of mass marriage not being common in Nigeria.
*19:21.960- 19:27.820* :  The only thing I am aware is that being a minister of women affairs is my duty to protect
*19:27.820- 19:33.500* :  the women and the children and when you tamper with the mother hands chicks, the mother
*19:33.500- 19:34.340* :  hand we react.
*19:34.500- 19:38.940* :  And I had to stop it because we have rights for all these young girls in Nigeria.
*19:38.940- 19:43.440* :  If it has been happening before I'm not aware, that was why this was shocked me and I had
*19:43.440- 19:44.480* :  to do what I had to do.
*19:44.700- 19:46.120* :  How young are some of these girls?
*19:46.420- 19:48.280* :  That's the investigation I want to carry out.
*19:48.280- 19:49.960* :  I'm not carried out investigation yet.
*19:50.440- 19:53.280* :  I just got an injunction to make sure the wedding does not hold.
*19:53.740- 19:59.580* :  Until such a time we clarify things and even check on their consents, their ages and
*19:59.620- 20:00.080* :  all that.
*20:00.200- 20:01.800* :  So I'm yet to do that.
*20:02.200- 20:05.080* :  But because of time frame I had to get the injunction first.
*20:05.420- 20:13.160* :  But as it is, we've made peace between myself, the speaker and the Emmy out of Katangora
*20:13.380- 20:17.320* :  because they said they don't want to quarrel with me and their sister, they don't want
*20:17.320- 20:18.220* :  to fight with me.
*20:18.540- 20:22.120* :  They have canceled the wedding, but I'm still holding on to my injunction.
*20:22.820- 20:26.240* :  The matter will still remain until after the date of the wedding.
*20:26.960- 20:31.440* :  Then I will be sure that everything is okay, then we'll take it from there.
*20:31.660- 20:35.900* :  Have you been able to be in touch with any of the girls and young women?
*20:36.480- 20:42.020* :  Where I touch with them and the most important thing is from Monday, a bank is going there
*20:42.020- 20:43.540* :  to open an account for them.
*20:43.940- 20:49.920* :  I want to take care of them, empower them, take them to school, sponsor this school from
*20:49.920- 20:55.020* :  the Ministry of Women Affairs and make sure they are more relaxed and more comfortable.
*20:55.100- 20:57.840* :  I want them to breathe fresh air.
*20:58.060- 21:03.080* :  So when I do that, I'm going to prove it by Monday and I will embody them on our portal
*21:03.780- 21:06.700* :  where they will start receiving help from the government.
*21:06.780- 21:11.600* :  As a partner with the Speaker, he is equally great to join in making sure those girls
*21:12.180- 21:13.060* :  get empowerment.
*21:13.920- 21:17.800* :  Udu Kennedy, Ohio and Nye, Nigeria's Minister of Women Affairs.
*21:18.540- 21:25.380* :  Next to India, a spice trade group has said that spice exports could drop by 40 percent
*21:25.380- 21:30.780* :  after two major brands in the country were hit with contamination allegations over the
*21:30.780- 21:31.960* :  use of a pesticide.
*21:32.300- 21:37.740* :  The organization considers the chemical safe, but others say it allegedly causes cancer
*21:37.740- 21:40.100* :  in the event of long-term exposure.
*21:40.820- 21:46.500* :  The Federation of Indian Spice stakeholders said the industry has already seen buyers put
*21:46.500- 21:53.920* :  some export orders on hold amid international scrutiny of two popular Indian brands, MDH
*21:53.920- 21:54.660* :  and Everest.
*21:55.160- 21:58.560* :  Both companies say their products are safe for consumption.
*21:59.160- 22:03.700* :  India is the world's biggest exporter, consumer and producer of spices.
*22:04.400- 22:09.880* :  James Reynolds spoke to our South Asia regional editor Umbarasanati Rajan and asked him for
*22:09.880- 22:11.160* :  more on the key worries.
*22:11.560- 22:17.280* :  This has caused a concern not only within India, which is the largest spice consumer in the
*22:17.320- 22:22.620* :  world, but also in countries around the globe, because Indian spices are being exported
*22:22.620- 22:29.280* :  to various countries from China, Bangladesh, Nepal, USA to various parts of Europe and Australia
*22:29.280- 22:33.440* :  as well, because you also have Indian communities living in far away places now.
*22:33.440- 22:39.440* :  What Hong Kong authorities and also in Singapore authorities were saying was that they found
*22:39.620- 22:44.800* :  these cancer-carsing pesticide ethynoxide in four of these brands.
*22:45.280- 22:50.020* :  In fact, Hong Kong withdrew four of these curry powders from its shops and the Singapore
*22:50.020- 22:54.540* :  one particular brand, one particular product of a brand was withdrawn.
*22:54.540- 22:59.500* :  Now this triggered alarm across the world and then the US Food and Drug Administration
*22:59.500- 23:01.800* :  agency, they say they are now investigating.
*23:02.400- 23:07.360* :  So this is a causing concern not only for the consumers, but also for those who are exporting
*23:07.400- 23:08.000* :  and producing.
*23:08.000- 23:13.580* :  It has also raised lots of questions about what kind of regularly mechanism, what kind
*23:13.580- 23:19.600* :  of inspections the Indian authorities do before these spices are exported to various
*23:19.600- 23:20.080* :  countries.
*23:20.260- 23:21.660* :  What's been India's response?
*23:22.140- 23:28.540* :  Now the Indian government has already ordered the various state agencies to inspect all
*23:28.540- 23:33.600* :  these factories where they manufacture and also the samples given by various companies
*23:34.020- 23:34.880* :  for exports.
*23:35.400- 23:40.300* :  So they want to get to the bottom of it because this market is about four billion dollars
*23:40.300- 23:44.840* :  exports to outside India and also ten billion dollars within the country.
*23:45.020- 23:49.680* :  And now the traders are worried, exporters are worried if China or other countries take
*23:49.680- 23:54.120* :  action that could take a big hit on the export potential, that means potential loss of
*23:54.120- 23:56.020* :  revenue and loss of jobs.
*23:56.020- 23:58.380* :  That is a big concern on the other hand.
*23:58.380- 24:02.600* :  What the environmentalists and activists are pointing out is that Indian government should
*24:03.080- 24:08.800* :  strengthen its regulatory and inspection mechanisms and the whole approach towards food safety
*24:08.800- 24:14.080* :  needs to change how come this particular business side was allowed to be found in two brands.
*24:14.080- 24:18.620* :  But even though these two companies strongly deny then they say that their products are
*24:18.620- 24:20.220* :  safe for human consumption.
*24:20.800- 24:25.360* :  But this is also causing concern among the authorities because they need to get to the
*24:25.360- 24:28.160* :  bottom of it to prevent any cascading effect.
*24:28.360- 24:29.600* :  Umbarassan at Aarajan.
*24:30.080- 24:35.060* :  The president of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, has criticized what he said were manifest
*24:35.060- 24:40.060* :  failures by the British and Irish governments to investigate the bombings in Dublin and
*24:40.060- 24:45.180* :  Monahan in the 1970s, 33 people were killed, two of them pregnant women.
*24:45.800- 24:50.940* :  It is also reported that the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair had discussed the
*24:50.940- 24:55.540* :  matter and what intelligence agencies knew with a former Irish counterpart.
*24:56.360- 25:01.380* :  A ceremony was held in Dublin on Friday to mark the 50th anniversary of the attacks.
*25:02.140- 25:04.760* :  Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss has this report.
*25:08.660- 25:13.060* :  It was the most deadly attack during Northern Ireland's long conflict, but it happened
*25:13.060- 25:14.360* :  in the Irish Republic.
*25:14.740- 25:20.460* :  Three bombs went off in Dublin and one in the town of Monahan on May 17, 1974.
*25:21.040- 25:25.700* :  The loyalist paramilitary group, the UVF, eventually said it was behind the explosions,
*25:26.340- 25:28.000* :  but nobody was ever convicted.
*25:28.100- 25:32.740* :  And there have been long-running allegations that elements within the British state colluded
*25:32.740- 25:36.000* :  in the attack or at least obstructed the investigation.
*25:36.180- 25:41.100* :  The Irish president, Michael Higgins, laid a wreath at a memorial to those who were killed,
*25:41.460- 25:44.240* :  forcing survivors and relatives of the dead.
*25:44.820- 25:50.120* :  It is your self and your families who have had to bear the blief of those tragic events,
*25:50.980- 25:58.320* :  and added to it, have had to bear the long-waited for information on those tragic events that
*25:58.320- 26:00.380* :  was and is your right.
*26:00.640- 26:05.080* :  Today's ceremony was also attended by Ireland's former Prime Minister Bertia Hurn.
*26:05.140- 26:11.600* :  He said Tony Blair had once told him that MI5 and MI6 probably had information about
*26:11.600- 26:14.040* :  the bombings, but that they wouldn't release it.
*26:14.340- 26:18.220* :  Mr Hurn too called for all relevant documents now to be handed over.
*26:18.900- 26:23.620* :  In fact, the UVF gang thought to be responsible for the bombings is currently being looked
*26:23.620- 26:28.340* :  at, as part of a wider police inquiry into historic crimes committed during the troubles.
*26:28.900- 26:32.060* :  Their report is due to be published by the end of this year.
*26:32.420- 26:32.940* :  Paul Moss.
*26:33.860- 26:38.940* :  The Iranian Football Federation has ruled that only female fans will be allowed into football
*26:38.940- 26:41.820* :  matches between two local men's teams next season.
*26:42.300- 26:47.280* :  The unprecedented move follows abuse of some female spectators at a recent match between
*26:47.280- 26:47.860* :  the sides.
*26:48.440- 26:49.100* :  Here's Mike Thompson.
*26:49.740- 26:54.700* :  Until recently, Iranian women were banned from football stadiums with only a handful
*26:54.700- 26:55.880* :  of special exceptions.
*26:56.540- 27:02.560* :  Now, Iranian male supporters of two men's teams, SEPAHAN and PERSID POLICE, are getting
*27:02.560- 27:06.780* :  the same treatment after some female fans suffered verbal abuse.
*27:07.360- 27:11.520* :  Next season, only women will be allowed to watch the sides play each other.
*27:11.920- 27:18.240* :  Iranian media described the move as a significant shift in the status of women in Iranian society.
*27:18.880- 27:24.720* :  But as arrests of those breaching the country's strict headscarf rule continue, many may feel
*27:24.720- 27:26.760* :  there's a very long way to go yet.
*27:27.360- 27:28.160* :  Mike Thompson.
*27:29.240- 27:32.180* :  It's been a big week for British Royal portraits.
*27:32.180- 27:36.240* :  A big red painting of King Charles was unveiled on Tuesday.
*27:36.240- 27:39.140* :  I will share it on social media if you haven't seen it.
*27:39.460- 27:44.780* :  Then on Friday in Central London, an exhibition of photographic portraits of the Royal Family
*27:44.780- 27:49.080* :  opened, alongside some previously unseen images of the Royal Family.
*27:50.060- 27:55.140* :  It's a reminder of the power of photography over the last century, to define how we see
*27:55.140- 28:00.740* :  and understand this institution, and it tells a tale of a changing monarchy, adapting
*28:00.740- 28:02.980* :  to the fashions and more as of the decades.
*28:03.940- 28:08.520* :  Our Royal correspondent, Johnny Diamond, went to the King's Gallery next to Buckingham Palace
*28:08.520- 28:09.320* :  to take a look.
*28:09.800- 28:15.560* :  He asked the curator, Alessandro Nassini, to highlight a few portraits that tell the story
*28:15.560- 28:16.480* :  of the exhibition.
*28:16.720- 28:21.800* :  The exhibition charts the evolution of our portrait photography over the past century.
*28:22.720- 28:25.900* :  And we are here in the first room in the exhibition.
*28:26.480- 28:33.460* :  On my right is the engagement portrait of Prince Albert and Lady Elizabeth Paul's Lion,
*28:34.280- 28:37.100* :  who will become King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.
*28:37.840- 28:42.300* :  It was produced in 1923 by a photographer called Emil Hoppe.
*28:42.840- 28:44.440* :  This is a monochrome photograph.
*28:44.540- 28:48.740* :  Several portraits were taken and somewhere released to the press, but this particular one was
*28:48.740- 28:53.140* :  never released, so was kept for private use and share only between family and friends.
*28:53.720- 28:55.640* :  They're both looking at the camera.
*28:56.160- 29:01.100* :  And although it's relatively formal, they're close to each other, aren't they?
*29:01.100- 29:03.700* :  This is a pretty intimate picture.
*29:04.740- 29:05.080* :  Exactly.
*29:05.180- 29:10.160* :  And in fact, the photographs which were released at the time, they were quite far apart.
*29:11.080- 29:15.600* :  And to our right, something that feels very different.
*29:16.380- 29:22.260* :  Yes, we have the official coronation portrait of King Charles III, which was taken by Hugo
*29:22.260- 29:26.320* :  Bernard only over a year ago on 6 May 2023.
*29:26.920- 29:28.540* :  And of course, it's an official portrait.
*29:29.500- 29:33.360* :  So in this room, we have some elements contrasting with each other.
*29:33.680- 29:40.820* :  You go from the very sort of private personal moments to the most official possible moment,
*29:40.820- 29:42.140* :  such as the coronation.
*29:42.660- 29:48.060* :  And in the coronation photograph, the King is holding in one hand the orb, in the other
*29:48.060- 29:53.160* :  hand, the scepter that are these great flowing robes of purple and ermine.
*29:53.580- 30:03.200* :  And on top of him, this astonishing crown as well, he is almost a prop for the ornaments
*30:03.200- 30:03.880* :  of state.
*30:05.040- 30:10.380* :  In a portrait, an official portrait like this, you need to embrace the theatricality, perhaps
*30:10.380- 30:11.540* :  of the coronation.
*30:11.540- 30:13.020* :  All those elements are to be present.
*30:13.720- 30:19.720* :  And the tradition of a coronation portrait has to be respected, but also a certain element
*30:19.720- 30:26.680* :  of innovation, perhaps the way the King is sitting, which is perhaps not traditional in a way,
*30:26.760- 30:27.960* :  so a little more informal.
*30:28.200- 30:30.520* :  He's tried to be supposed more relatable.
*30:30.620- 30:34.060* :  He wants to show his King, you know, everybody.
*30:35.000- 30:40.840* :  And might take you actually to the next photograph, which perhaps we can express that a bit more.
*30:41.200- 30:41.460* :  Let's get.
*30:45.340- 30:47.740* :  And I love this photograph, I always loved it.
*30:48.060- 30:52.700* :  This is Cecil Beaton's portrait of Quillis with the Second from 1968.
*30:52.880- 31:03.340* :  She's against a very plain light backdrop, wearing this long dark cape fixed at the neck
*31:03.340- 31:04.780* :  with a chain.
*31:05.560- 31:07.660* :  But she's not staring directly at the camera.
*31:08.200- 31:08.360* :  Yes.
*31:08.780- 31:11.080* :  She is a very solitary figure.
*31:11.680- 31:20.600* :  And she is not depicted with any traditional regalia, such as tiaras or insignia or very important
*31:20.640- 31:21.140* :  jewelry.
*31:21.800- 31:26.360* :  I think Beaton really captures the fact that that's the woman behind the responsibility
*31:26.360- 31:27.020* :  of the crown.
*31:27.500- 31:29.180* :  I think it's very human as a portrait.
*31:29.720- 31:34.880* :  And every time I look at it, I always think of what Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mother wrote
*31:34.880- 31:37.800* :  to Beaton only five years early in 1963.
*31:38.300- 31:44.440* :  As a family, we must be typically grateful to you for producing us as really quite nice
*31:44.940- 31:46.080* :  and real people.
*31:46.620- 31:49.860* :  That gap between the public perception and the private reality.
*31:50.500- 31:50.920* :  Absolutely.
*31:51.180- 31:55.420* :  I think it's worth something that I hope comes through this exhibition is exactly that.
*31:56.240- 32:03.700* :  This range from the fully private and personal to the fully official is that, you know, just
*32:03.700- 32:08.160* :  showing different facets of people with this unique role.
*32:08.580- 32:09.880* :  That report by Johnny Diamond.
*32:09.880- 32:13.440* :  And you can see some of the photographs on the BBC News website.
*32:15.980- 32:16.940* :  And that's it from us for now.
