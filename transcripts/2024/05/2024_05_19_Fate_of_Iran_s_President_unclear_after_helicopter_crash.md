*01:31.120- 01:32.580* :  These are our main stories.
*01:33.180- 01:37.900* :  A major search operation in the mountains of Northwest Iran, where a helicopter carrying
*01:37.900- 01:40.100* :  President Ebrahim Rehsi has gone missing.
*01:40.500- 01:44.260* :  Rescue teams have been looking for the aircraft in rain and thick fog.
*01:45.080- 01:50.740* :  Spain recalls its ambassador to Argentina after the Argentine president made derogatory remarks

*02:16.680- 02:17.840* :  of Congo.
*02:19.340- 02:23.540* :  And was history made on the final day of the English Premier League season.
*02:27.420- 02:32.020* :  As we record this podcast, the fate of Iran's President Ebrahim Rehsi and the country's
*02:32.020- 02:33.860* :  foreign minister is still unclear.
*02:34.380- 02:38.360* :  After news broke that a helicopter carrying the two men had made what the authorities
*02:38.360- 02:39.880* :  called a hard landing.
*02:40.440- 02:44.720* :  Let's begin with how events have been covered from within Iran, starting with state TV.
*02:47.300- 02:51.580* :  There are unconfirmed reports of an incident involving the helicopter carrying the President
*02:51.580- 02:52.880* :  in the Drolfar region.
*02:53.640- 02:56.440* :  Initial reports cite a hard landing for the helicopter.
*02:57.340- 03:01.920* :  As you read in the Iran news bar minutes ago, rescue teams are trying to reach the incident
*03:01.920- 03:02.320* :  site.
*03:02.800- 03:08.060* :  Those early reports were confirmed by Iran's interior minister, Ahmad Vahidi, referring
*03:08.060- 03:11.480* :  to a trip the President and the foreign minister were making back from the border with
*03:12.260- 03:14.300* :  Azerbaijan in a convoy of three helicopters.
*03:17.380- 03:21.400* :  On the return journey, the President and others accompanying him were coming back in
*03:21.400- 03:22.380* :  several helicopters.
*03:22.860- 03:27.000* :  One of the helicopters was forced to make a rough landing due to bad weather conditions
*03:27.000- 03:28.400* :  and fog in the area.
*03:28.800- 03:32.660* :  In view of the bad weather conditions, you are taking time to get to the location of
*03:32.660- 03:33.240* :  the helicopter.
*03:33.280- 03:36.580* :  Things are under control and the rescue teams are doing their work.
*03:37.120- 03:41.540* :  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hamani issued a message of reassurance.
*03:49.440- 03:53.960* :  Dear people, Ayatollah Hamani says, whether you are listening now, or hear my speech
*03:53.960- 03:57.420* :  later, don't worry that we know disruption to the country's work.
*03:57.940- 04:00.960* :  Nonetheless, he called on Iranians to pray for Mr. A.E.C.
*04:01.460- 04:05.380* :  And state television showed worshipers at the shrine of Imam Reza in the President's
*04:05.380- 04:07.560* :  home city of Mashedad doing just that.
*04:09.140- 04:20.040* :  And what of the search and rescue operation?
*04:20.400- 04:24.780* :  The head of Iran's Red Crescent Society, Pierre Hussein Kolevans, said conditions were
*04:24.780- 04:25.600* :  hampering the mission.
*04:29.000- 04:33.340* :  Forty emergency response teams are searching the region now, but the weather conditions
*04:33.340- 04:37.500* :  are very bad and access to the area is also very difficult.
*04:38.460- 04:41.800* :  Colleagues are doing their best with used drones and aerial tools.
*04:41.940- 04:45.860* :  But because of the weather conditions, it's not possible to do an air search.
*04:46.580- 04:49.660* :  It's only possible using forces on the ground.
*04:49.660- 04:53.120* :  I've been hearing more from Bahman Kalebassi of BBC Persian.
*04:53.680- 04:59.460* :  We do know that after to take off three of them, not one, the one that carried President
*04:59.460- 05:02.260* :  and Foreign Minister did not make it to destination.
*05:03.140- 05:08.460* :  The crews and the number of rescue teams that have gone to the area have increased from
*05:08.460- 05:11.220* :  10, 15 to now over 50 or 60.
*05:11.940- 05:19.460* :  And there's been request to Turkey to send in night vision choppers capable to look overnight.
*05:19.460- 05:27.300* :  So while we've heard contradicting news about some initial contact that was made with one
*05:27.300- 05:31.200* :  member of the crew or two, that hasn't been confirmed.
*05:31.200- 05:34.460* :  And in fact, we've got other officials in Iran saying such thing didn't happen.
*05:34.460- 05:39.220* :  So it's very confusing as to whether there was any contact at all.
*05:39.700- 05:45.220* :  What we do know that they have no news officially at least of whereabouts of the President
*05:45.220- 05:45.800* :  and his team.
*05:46.160- 05:50.640* :  In terms of the search and rescue operation, it seemed to be almost impossible in the
*05:50.680- 05:55.000* :  daytime because of the thick fog and the bad weather conditions in the area.
*05:55.000- 05:58.080* :  I mean, I presume in the middle of the night, it's absolutely impossible.
*05:59.040- 06:05.240* :  It seems like impossible, even though the images we get, it seems the area is full of rescue
*06:05.240- 06:07.680* :  workers and their vehicles.
*06:07.680- 06:13.500* :  But that doesn't seem to be clear whether it's even close to the area of the crash.
*06:13.940- 06:19.120* :  That could be very much within thick mountain range or jungles or so.
*06:19.620- 06:22.580* :  That area is not a very easy area to reach and search.
*06:22.580- 06:25.020* :  As you say, even during the day, given the fog.
*06:25.560- 06:31.500* :  So as to hours go by, the chances of rescuing the President and his team is decreasing.
*06:32.120- 06:38.800* :  And the way the regime and its media are treating it, asking for people to pray, brings back
*06:38.800- 06:45.240* :  memories of other incidents where it ended up being that the people that were prayed for
*06:45.240- 06:46.440* :  never made it back.
*06:46.580- 06:51.460* :  So people obviously preparing themselves for that possibility for the announcement of the
*06:51.460- 06:57.740* :  death of the President, if that's what comes in the next few hours, what then happens?
*06:57.780- 06:58.740* :  Who's in charge?
*06:59.940- 07:04.300* :  Well, there is a constitution that lays out very clearly what happens.
*07:04.960- 07:09.960* :  And that is the first deputy to the President takes over for 50 days and there has to be
*07:09.960- 07:11.680* :  an election within those 50 days.
*07:12.420- 07:18.240* :  But we've seen the Supreme Leader decide sometimes to not abide by the Constitution.
*07:18.760- 07:25.720* :  So could he just say let the President run the show till the end of the year when the
*07:25.720- 07:30.060* :  next presidential election would have been in normal circumstances possible?
*07:30.680- 07:32.440* :  Or will he call for an election?
*07:32.440- 07:33.820* :  That's also possible too.
*07:34.120- 07:41.340* :  The reality is the foreign policy of the Iranian regime and much of what happens in the cabinet
*07:41.660- 07:45.240* :  is run through and with the approval of the Supreme Leader.
*07:45.240- 07:47.920* :  He's in place, the revolutionary guard is in place.
*07:48.540- 07:54.680* :  There isn't an expectation for a big turmoil in the affairs, day-to-day affairs of the
*07:54.740- 07:55.120* :  country.
*07:55.540- 07:57.800* :  Fatman Kalbassi of BBC Persian.
*07:58.340- 08:03.460* :  To the Democratic Republic of Congo next, where an attempted coup was thwarted on Sunday.
*08:03.960- 08:08.680* :  A spokesman for the Congolese army said a group of about 20 men had tried to storm the
*08:08.680- 08:10.180* :  presidential palace at dawn.
*08:10.720- 08:14.680* :  Brigadier General Silva Ekenguez said the situation was now under control and the
*08:14.680- 08:15.920* :  attackers were out of action.
*08:16.560- 08:21.000* :  The U.S. ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo say she's very concerned by reports
*08:21.000- 08:25.840* :  that American citizens were involved in the attempted coup and two men arrested afterwards
*08:25.840- 08:28.440* :  are reported to have been carrying U.S. passports.
*08:28.880- 08:31.720* :  Christian Malanga was reportedly one of the plotters.
*08:32.200- 08:40.420* :  The brave men who walked with me stood up and said to the North with this road regime,
*08:40.420- 08:47.580* :  a detership, a regime that has sucked our blood with the military say to the North.
*08:48.320- 08:50.120* :  I've got my name on Christian Malanga.
*08:50.780- 08:55.220* :  He's believed to have been killed in the coup attempt, more from our deputy-Africa editor
*08:55.220- 08:56.000* :  Ansoy.
*08:56.300- 09:00.860* :  There was a lot of tension in the morning when pictures started emerging on social media
*09:00.860- 09:07.320* :  circulating, showing armed men with AK-47s trying to lower the flags outside the presidential
*09:07.320- 09:13.000* :  palace and raise the former flag of the country when it was called Zaire and shouting
*09:13.000- 09:17.880* :  our Zaire and saying that we are coming for you, misusecated the president.
*09:17.900- 09:22.300* :  But then that situation we understand was arrested pretty quickly by the presidential
*09:22.540- 09:22.740* :  guard.
*09:23.040- 09:25.820* :  The leader of this group was killed.
*09:26.440- 09:30.780* :  And right now we understand that the situation is coming back to normal.
*09:31.040- 09:36.220* :  There had been a barricade set up outside the presidential palace earlier in the day.
*09:36.220- 09:42.380* :  The president's office, but we understand that after deployment of security it has now
*09:42.380- 09:48.680* :  been removed and the movement of traffic is back to normal in that area.
*09:49.100- 09:54.300* :  Now that the new Zaire movement is a thing, I just wonder whether this was expected, whether
*09:54.300- 09:56.800* :  this has been built up to, whether it's been out of nowhere.
*09:57.960- 10:05.680* :  It actually has been out of nowhere because whilst Christian Malanga, the man behind this
*10:06.420- 10:13.120* :  attempted coup and the man who has been killed, has been in Congolese politics in the past.
*10:13.120- 10:16.660* :  He had moved to the United States where he settled with his family.
*10:16.740- 10:22.220* :  He launched his political party whilst he was there and has been mobilizing particularly
*10:22.780- 10:24.160* :  Congolese in the diaspora.
*10:24.700- 10:30.320* :  And we are hearing from the army that among those who took part in that attempted coup were
*10:30.400- 10:30.860* :  foreigners.
*10:31.380- 10:37.540* :  The U.S. ambassador in Kinshasa has issued a statement to say that they are looking into
*10:37.540- 10:40.760* :  the reports that Americans may have been involved.
*10:41.440- 10:46.020* :  Apart from wanting a different person other than Felix Shishikari to be president, what
*10:46.020- 10:46.900* :  else do they want?
*10:47.540- 10:53.960* :  It is not clear because this is a political grouping that has been essentially based outside
*10:54.540- 11:01.040* :  the country and whilst Mr Malanga did run once he attempted to run for a parliamentary
*11:01.040- 11:08.040* :  office in around 2011, not much has been heard from him since around that time since he left
*11:08.080- 11:08.700* :  the country.
*11:08.700- 11:11.060* :  So it came as a surprise to many people.
*11:11.600- 11:15.960* :  Would you expect there to be some kind of crack down now on this group and people who supported?
*11:16.480- 11:22.060* :  Absolutely, because this could not have been undertaken completely by people who have
*11:22.060- 11:27.880* :  been based outside the country who haven't had no links with people based inside the Democratic
*11:27.880- 11:28.880* :  Republic of Congo.
*11:28.880- 11:35.020* :  So we can anticipate that the authorities will be looking into who are their contacts locally.
*11:35.440- 11:36.320* :  What do they know?
*11:36.640- 11:41.500* :  Who have they been in touch with since coming back to the Democratic Republic of Congo?
*11:42.120- 11:48.080* :  Our deputy, Africa, editor and soy, 140 students have been flown back to Pakistan from
*11:48.080- 11:51.980* :  the Kyrgyz capital after violence that targeted foreigners and migrant workers.
*11:52.580- 11:56.760* :  At Pakistani officials said there were plans to organize more flights to bring students
*11:56.760- 11:57.560* :  from Bishkek.
*11:57.960- 12:02.100* :  Police said the attack began after some foreigners whose nationality wasn't immediately
*12:02.100- 12:04.260* :  clear, beat up locals in the city.
*12:04.580- 12:06.200* :  More from embarrassing at the Rajan.
*12:06.720- 12:11.420* :  The violence targeting foreign students and migrant workers in the Kyrgyz capital has
*12:11.420- 12:13.280* :  triggered concerns in Pakistan.
*12:13.460- 12:19.620* :  It is estimated that about 10,000 Pakistani students are studying in Kyrgyzstan, which
*12:19.620- 12:22.240* :  is particularly popular with medical students.
*12:22.760- 12:28.200* :  Police in Bishkek said the clashes began after some foreigners whose nationality was not
*12:28.200- 12:31.320* :  immediately clear, beat up locals in the city.
*12:31.340- 12:36.960* :  At least 28 people were injured in the violence on Friday night, including four Pakistani
*12:36.960- 12:37.740* :  nationals.
*12:38.120- 12:43.680* :  Following their attacks, about 130 Pakistani students returned home on Saturday night.
*12:44.140- 12:49.480* :  The Pakistani government has told worried relatives to bring back any student wanting
*12:49.480- 12:51.780* :  to leave Kyrgyzstan due to the violence.
*12:52.320- 12:57.660* :  The Pakistani Foreign Ministry on Saturday summoned Kyrgyzstan's top diplomat in Islam
*12:57.660- 13:00.440* : abad to launch a protest over the incident.
*13:00.900- 13:06.860* :  India and Bangladesh have also urged their students to stay indoors and be in touch with
*13:06.860- 13:08.320* :  the respective embassies.
*13:08.600- 13:13.860* :  The Kyrgyz government says the situation is now stable and security measures around
*13:36.420- 13:40.900* :  dormitories where foreign students live have been strengthened.
*13:41.100- 13:42.780* :  Around 20,000.
*13:43.380- 13:48.100* :  The former British soldier Jack Hurn, who is 100 years old, visited the graveyard at the
*13:48.100- 13:50.920* :  foot of the hill to pay his respects to fallen colleagues.
*13:51.360- 13:54.400* :  All those people there were the ones who were behind me.
*13:55.040- 13:57.240* :  Without them, I wouldn't be here.
*13:58.680- 14:03.980* :  It's wonderful to think you can come back to a place like this and pay homage to all those
*14:04.020- 14:06.100* :  guys, each and every one of them.
*14:07.040- 14:11.000* :  They wanted to put it on the back, not me, I was one of millions of other people.
*14:12.480- 14:19.660* :  That little thing up there, we fought it with catapults in their head, modern machine guns.
*14:20.640- 14:21.480* :  But we beat them.
*14:22.740- 14:23.380* :  We beat them.
*14:24.180- 14:26.680* :  Our correspondent Kashmir Dera spent the day there.
*14:27.200- 14:33.720* :  There have been numerous commemoration events, services, masses and lots and lots of
*14:34.200- 14:39.900* :  thought and reflection across Casino, this area at the foot of Monte Casino, the imposing
*14:39.900- 14:45.980* :  hilltop that saw so much battle in brutal conditions 80 years ago.
*14:46.420- 14:51.640* :  There have been commemoration at the Polish War Cemetery and right now I'm at the Commonwealth
*14:51.640- 14:58.080* :  War Cemetery where the families and relatives of those who have been impacted by what happened
*14:58.080- 15:03.220* :  80 years ago are here, among them the veterans themselves and they are very much the centre
*15:03.220- 15:08.780* :  of attention because there are so few left living veterans, they're now at least a hundred
*15:08.780- 15:13.860* :  years old for most of them and they're here to be honoured but also to carry on the memory
*15:13.860- 15:16.100* :  of those many thousands who passed.
*15:16.800- 15:18.740* :  And you've been talking to them, what have they told you?
*15:21.380- 15:27.500* :  Well, it's been so immersive, it's been so emotional because these are people that witnessed
*15:27.500- 15:31.380* :  first hand and lost their colleagues in such difficult conditions.
*15:31.500- 15:36.660* :  Casino is lush and green but what happened here 80 years ago, the whole area was reduced
*15:36.660- 15:41.680* :  to rubble and friends and colleagues just lay where they fell and what you find with
*15:41.680- 15:47.380* :  these veterans is that they bring up their friends, they remember them so vividly and
*15:47.380- 15:51.960* :  they speak about them with tears in their eyes and this is what's really, really important.
*15:51.960- 15:56.160* :  The families of the veterans, the families of the deceased really want Monte Casino to
*15:56.160- 16:02.140* :  be remembered, the brutal battles that happened between January and May 1944.
*16:02.920- 16:08.100* :  And Casino, it was devastating for both sides in the conflict but also for the civilian
*16:08.820- 16:08.840* :  population.
*16:08.880- 16:15.260* :  Oh yes, this whole area was reduced to rubble.
*16:15.860- 16:21.220* :  It was bombarded to such an extent that the cemetery in which I'm standing in, the bodies
*16:21.220- 16:26.160* :  were not able to be buried until the rubble and all the destruction was removed.
*16:26.840- 16:32.440* :  This whole area was reduced to just mud and when you look at it now as I'm turning around
*16:32.440- 16:37.560* :  and seeing the lush green of the beautiful mountains around me, it's difficult to imagine
*16:37.620- 16:44.220* :  that 80 years ago this was blood within the mud of what is now feels.
*16:44.860- 16:48.500* :  Kashmodeira describing the scene at Monte Casino to Alex Ritson.
*16:51.040- 16:52.160* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*16:53.020- 17:00.420* :  We don't want to enter a Russia or be a part of it, we are in a crossroads and this is
*17:00.420- 17:02.220* :  the darkest time of the Georgia.
*17:03.100- 17:07.300* :  Protests continue on the streets of the Georgian capital to Blesi against a new law,
*17:07.600- 17:12.200* :  the critics say will thwart the country's efforts to join the European Union and put it
*17:12.200- 17:13.660* :  back into the orbit of Russia.
*17:21.140- 17:23.660* :  When it comes to your finances, you think you've done it all.

*18:30.700- 18:35.080* :  There was a meeting of hard-right nationalist political leaders from Europe today in Madrid
*18:35.080- 18:40.160* :  hosted by the hard-right Vox Party and the get together has caused quite a stir down
*18:40.160- 18:44.700* :  to a speech from their special guest, the new hard-right libertarian president of Argentina,
*18:45.280- 18:50.260* :  during which Javier Melae said this, apparently, about the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
*18:52.700- 18:57.880* :  The global elites don't realize how destructive it can be to implement the ideas of socialism.
*18:58.620- 19:01.760* :  They don't know what kind of society and country it can produce.
*19:02.680- 19:07.440* :  When he has a corrupt wife, it stains him and he takes five days to think about it.
*19:07.600- 19:12.500* :  Mr. Sanchez has described those allegations and a legal inquiry into his wife,
*19:12.500- 19:15.180* :  begon, Yagomis, as slander and harassment.
*19:15.760- 19:20.140* :  After the speech from the Argentinian president, the Spanish government said it's recalling
*19:20.140- 19:21.580* :  its ambassador to Argentina.
*19:21.700- 19:25.800* :  Tim Franks has been hearing more from our correspondent in Madrid, Guy Hegeco.
*19:26.240- 19:30.960* :  We had the news earlier in the day that there was this gathering of the hard-right in Madrid.
*19:31.580- 19:34.080* :  That produced a few headlines in itself.
*19:35.020- 19:41.480* :  I suppose it's not entirely unexpected that Javier Melae would make controversial remarks
*19:41.480- 19:44.780* :  when he's addressing his supporters of the hard-right.
*19:45.560- 19:47.420* :  So in that sense, perhaps it's not that surprising.
*19:47.440- 19:53.100* :  But the fact that he actually directly addressed the Prime Minister and his wife in those terms,
*19:53.100- 19:57.380* :  that has really caused a bit of shock for many people here in Spain,
*19:57.480- 19:59.720* :  and it certainly seems to have shocked the Spanish government.
*19:59.800- 20:06.740* :  And the Foreign Minister, José Manuel Albares, gave a very stern lengthy statement explaining
*20:06.740- 20:12.640* :  how this had brought bilateral relations between the two countries to its lowest point in recent history
*20:12.640- 20:18.920* :  and how he was taking this extremely seriously and was demanding a public apology from Mr. Melae.
*20:19.060- 20:22.100* :  And I mean quite apart from the insinuations about the Prime Minister's wife,
*20:22.100- 20:27.460* :  I mean Mr. Melae described socialism as cursed and carcinogenic.
*20:27.460- 20:34.320* :  And I suppose we should remember that Mr. Sanchez, the Prime Minister, leads the socialist party.
*20:35.500- 20:36.520* :  Yes, that's right.
*20:37.500- 20:41.140* :  Again, you have to put this in the context of this being a rally of the hard-right.
*20:41.140- 20:47.720* :  There were other hard-right leaders there, Marine Le Pen of France's National Rally party,
*20:47.720- 20:54.380* :  Portuguese hard-right leader as well, and several thousand supporters of the Vox party,
*20:54.380- 20:56.140* :  the far-right Spanish party.
*20:56.140- 21:00.020* :  So these kind of comments went down extremely well at the rally,
*21:00.340- 21:03.700* :  was the kind of thing that the people listening seem to want to hear.
*21:04.420- 21:10.680* :  But of course it's seen as deeply offensive for the president of one country to speak in that way
*21:11.420- 21:15.500* :  about another country or about the leader or the wife or the leader of another country.
*21:16.860- 21:21.440* :  The question now is where all this goes in terms of the relationship between Spain and Argentina,
*21:21.500- 21:25.980* :  because they do have in many ways an extremely close relationship, certainly in terms of trade,
*21:26.640- 21:29.700* :  in terms of cultural ties and many other ways.
*21:29.840- 21:31.660* :  These are two very close countries.
*21:31.660- 21:39.900* :  So the question now is, will all of this somehow affect that relationship in the medium or longer term?
*21:40.140- 21:44.600* :  And just remind us where we are in terms of the allegations against the Prime Minister's wife,
*21:44.820- 21:46.800* :  and indeed on the Prime Minister's future.
*21:48.360- 21:53.180* :  Well, the derangations of influence peddling, an investigation was opened by a court,
*21:53.780- 21:57.920* :  accepting these allegations, which were made by a far-right campaigning group,
*21:58.040- 22:00.980* :  which has made a lot of allegations in the past against politicians.
*22:02.120- 22:04.720* :  So the court is in theory investigating this.
*22:05.260- 22:09.120* :  However, begone your goal method, the Prime Minister's wife has not been charged,
*22:09.800- 22:12.780* :  and a public prosecutor said that the case should be shelved,
*22:12.880- 22:17.220* :  because there's not enough evidence that it's simply based on newspaper cuttings, essentially.
*22:17.220- 22:19.460* :  So it's a very divisive case.
*22:20.000- 22:24.060* :  The Prime Minister insists that it's part of a conspiracy against his government.
*22:24.920- 22:26.140* :  Guy Hedgeko in Madrid.
*22:26.220- 22:31.740* :  There being fresh protests on the streets of the Georgian capital to Bliisi against a new law,
*22:32.060- 22:35.800* :  the critics say will thwart the country's efforts to join the European Union,
*22:35.800- 22:38.160* :  and instead pull it back into Russia's orbit.
*22:38.160- 22:43.860* :  The law, which echoes one in force in Russia, seeks to restrict the freedom of civil society
*22:43.860- 22:49.220* :  organizations. The Georgian President vetoed it, but Parliament is expected to overall that.
*22:49.660- 22:51.620* :  Andrew Harding reports from to Bliisi.
*22:57.300- 22:59.860* :  It's a warm, clear night here in to Bliisi.
*22:59.860- 23:01.800* :  In the protests have started up again.
*23:01.980- 23:05.060* :  There must be several thousand people around me already.
*23:05.800- 23:07.900* :  Almost all of them, young Georgians,
*23:07.900- 23:12.780* :  as a big group in white medical overruns, young doctors here,
*23:12.980- 23:15.720* :  joining the protests, all very worried,
*23:16.400- 23:21.200* :  that their country's dream of joining Europe is suddenly in real danger.
*23:23.320- 23:28.280* :  We don't want to enter Russia or be a part of it.
*23:28.780- 23:31.140* :  By this law, we think that it will be part of it.
*23:31.320- 23:33.660* :  So we want to protest it.
*23:34.520- 23:38.260* :  We are in a crossroads, and this is the darkest time of the Georgian.
*23:39.000- 23:44.420* :  There's quite a bit police presence here, and that is an issue, because in the past few days,
*23:45.140- 23:49.980* :  there have been a lot of very violent incidents, activists, opposition politicians,
*23:50.880- 23:53.100* :  being targeted by the security forces.
*23:56.180- 24:02.920* :  I've come to a hospital here in to Bliisi to meet an activist who was badly beaten by the police
*24:02.920- 24:09.760* :  during the protests. His name is David Katselava, and he's in a wheelchair coming towards me now,
*24:09.980- 24:13.420* :  has faced badly bruised.
*24:14.520- 24:22.540* :  The face bones are broken. I almost lose my eye, and I also got a concussion.
*24:22.800- 24:29.860* :  Why do you believe that the police are, it seems, targeting activists' opponents at the moment?
*24:31.020- 24:36.160* :  To kill the democracy in Georgia, to kill the free society in Georgia.
*24:36.720- 24:38.720* :  But are things that clear cut?
*24:41.120- 24:44.820* :  I've come to meet older Georgians, shopping at a busy vegetable market.
*24:45.360- 24:49.340* :  They seem wary of provoking yet another conflict with Russia.
*24:52.260- 24:56.340* :  Georgia and Georgia share the same orthodox faith.
*24:56.760- 25:00.160* :  Maybe Europe is for the young people, but not for me.
*25:02.540- 25:10.540* :  Zainabhi says other countries, she means both Russia and the West, should step back and let Georgia find its own path.
*25:11.580- 25:15.940* :  Government officials here agree with that, but they go much further.
*25:17.960- 25:24.500* :  Kaka Kaladze, the mayor of to Bliisi, tells me the West is funding and orchestrating the street
*25:24.500- 25:30.380* :  protests and trying to bully Georgia into siding with Europe against Moscow.
*25:35.120- 25:38.300* :  The main thing we want is peace, maintaining peace.
*25:39.200- 25:43.240* :  We will now let our country share the same destiny as Ukraine, and what's happening there.
*25:43.760- 25:46.220* :  We know how difficult war is, we know the consequences.
*25:50.500- 25:54.580* :  It's dark here now and the protests are still going on and getting larger.
*25:54.580- 25:58.240* :  Someone has just set fire to a Russian flag here.
*25:58.920- 26:01.300* :  Younger Georgians clearly have made their choice.
*26:01.300- 26:07.580* :  They want a European future, but with an ever more aggressive authoritarian Russia,
*26:07.840- 26:10.500* :  right next to it, they can have a long struggle.
*26:14.240- 26:15.680* :  Andrew Harding in to Bliisi.
*26:16.220- 26:19.040* :  So, was history going to be made on the last day of the season?
*26:19.040- 26:22.800* :  One of the richest football leagues in the world, the English Premier League.
*26:23.180- 26:24.200* :  That's here from Deleth Lloyd.
*26:24.620- 26:28.120* :  Manchester City and Arsenal both went into the final round of fixtures,
*26:28.700- 26:30.700* :  knowing they could win the Premier League.
*26:31.060- 26:36.040* :  If City were to win, it would be game over and they would win a fourth and precedented Premier League title,
*26:36.040- 26:37.180* :  which is what they did.
*26:37.180- 26:40.820* :  They beat West Ham by three goals to one at the Etihad Stadium,
*26:40.820- 26:43.880* :  Phil Foden scoring twice in the opening 18 minutes,
*26:43.960- 26:46.040* :  which really didn't give much of a sense of jeopardy,
*26:46.040- 26:48.600* :  because Arsenal would have got that message through as well.
*26:48.600- 26:51.220* :  Arsenal did win their match to one at home to Everton,
*26:51.220- 26:55.440* :  but that wasn't enough, and they once again finish runners-up to Manchester City
*26:56.160- 26:57.900* :  behind them by two points in the table.
*26:57.900- 27:01.600* :  So City winners once again, and Arsenal, and they manage a Mikhail Arte,
*27:01.600- 27:02.860* :  and narrowly missing out.
*27:03.180- 27:06.760* :  Congratulations Manchester City for the trophy, the table in unbelievable.
*27:07.260- 27:10.480* :  We tried with all the enthusiasm, energy,
*27:10.900- 27:14.100* :  quality that we had, and we came really close.
*27:14.420- 27:16.140* :  You have to hand the right to win it,
*27:16.280- 27:18.660* :  but it didn't happen because another team was better,
*27:18.660- 27:20.600* :  so it makes emotions today.
*27:20.760- 27:24.080* :  Emotion all round, because we've got Mikhail Arte there.
*27:24.080- 27:27.160* :  My timeline is full of videos that Manchester City are posting
*27:27.160- 27:29.440* :  of the team celebrating in the dressing room of the Etihad,
*27:29.440- 27:31.400* :  which are really lovely to have a look at.
*27:31.460- 27:32.560* :  And then we had Jürgen Klopp.
*27:33.280- 27:35.000* :  Yes, it was always going to be a long goodbye,
*27:35.000- 27:37.660* :  after he announced he would be departing at the end of the season,
*27:37.660- 27:38.920* :  that was way back in November.
*27:39.400- 27:41.180* :  And it was a celebratory moment for him as well,
*27:41.180- 27:43.720* :  because Liverpool did beat Wolves 2-0 at Anfield,
*27:44.260- 27:48.920* :  but he had the opportunity at the end to thank the supporters and speak to the crowd.
*27:48.920- 27:51.220* :  And as you can imagine, that was quite emotional
*27:51.220- 27:53.420* :  when he did address those Liverpool fans on the Anfield pitch.
*27:53.980- 27:56.640* :  I'm so happy. I can't believe it.
*27:57.080- 28:00.040* :  I'm so happy about you all, about the atmosphere,
*28:00.040- 28:02.960* :  about the game, about being part of this family,
*28:03.560- 28:07.440* :  about us, how we celebrate at this day.
*28:07.440- 28:09.420* :  It's just incredible. Thank you so much.
*28:10.720- 28:13.020* :  Jürgen Klopp, saying goodbye to Liverpool supporters
*28:13.020- 28:17.500* :  at their home ground of Anfield after nine successful years in charge.
*28:18.160- 28:19.500* :  What are people saying in Manchester?
*28:20.500- 28:21.980* :  Oh, it's just absolutely delight.
*28:21.980- 28:22.900* :  I mean, what can you say?
*28:22.900- 28:26.160* :  I think, you know, I have friends of other teams saying,
*28:26.180- 28:27.380* :  you know, do you get sick of it?
*28:27.380- 28:29.780* :  But I'm not sure how you can get sick of winning.
*28:29.960- 28:31.100* :  It's just an amazing feeling.
*28:31.100- 28:33.780* :  Every single time we do it is like the first time.
*28:34.260- 28:36.680* :  Lots of pride in the team's history-making achievement,
*28:36.680- 28:39.020* :  winning the Premier League four times in a row.
*28:39.520- 28:43.140* :  The sole focus of absolutely every single thing that we do well is the manager.
*28:43.140- 28:46.820* :  I think, you know, we've seen absolutely amazing teams across history.
*28:47.120- 28:50.540* :  It all comes down to, do you have a set up in place and a manager
*28:50.540- 28:53.960* :  who's going to keep pushing these players on every single time?
*28:54.400- 28:56.800* :  It helps as well that we've got absolutely amazing players.
*28:57.380- 29:01.700* :  What they've managed to give to the fans over the last five, six, seven years
*29:01.700- 29:03.220* :  has just been amazing.
*29:03.260- 29:07.300* :  So, you know, we can only thank them and enjoy the ride, really.
*29:07.660- 29:09.500* :  And congratulations to Manchester City.
*29:11.860- 29:12.760* :  That's all from us for now.
*29:12.760- 29:15.300* :  There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
