*01:26.800- 01:32.160* :  I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 28th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:32.860- 01:37.340* :  There are reports of tanks reaching the centre of Raffa as Israel intensifies its military
*01:37.340- 01:42.820* :  operation despite condemnation over the deaths of Palestinian civilians. Three more nations
*01:42.820- 01:48.740* :  officially recognise Palestine as a state. It's crunch time in Georgia as Parliament votes on
*01:48.740- 01:54.160* :  its divisive foreign agent's law and move many seers as step away from the West and towards Russia.
*01:56.340- 02:00.500* :  Also in this podcast on the eve of South Africa's elections, we look at the length some people
*02:00.500- 02:06.300* :  in the post to part 8 South Africa go to to find a home. It was a toilet before. It was a toilet?
*02:06.300- 02:12.960* :  Yes. And now you have a kitchen. I have a kitchen toilet, the apartments. This place actually gave me
*02:12.960- 02:18.880* :  a bit of home. And why an album no one's heard has got top billing at a museum in Australia.
*02:22.120- 02:26.620* :  Israel's forces have moved deeper into Raffa in southern Gaza as it carries out its most
*02:26.620- 02:31.440* :  intense bombardment of the city since it began its military operation there three weeks ago.
*02:32.040- 02:36.680* :  Israel say it's an offensive that's necessary to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions there
*02:36.680- 02:43.080* :  and free hostages. But the cost of Palestinian lives has been high. On Sunday, 45 people in a
*02:43.080- 02:48.480* :  camp for displaced people were killed and strikes on the night of Monday into Tuesday killed 16 more
*02:48.480- 02:53.540* :  according to Hamas officials. There are now reports that several Israeli tanks have reached the
*02:53.540- 03:01.120* :  centre of Raffa. Hundreds of families have had to flee. We woke up at six in the morning from
*03:01.120- 03:04.880* :  the shelling and rockets. We don't know where we're going. We don't have tents. We don't have
*03:04.880- 03:09.840* :  anything. We have children with us and my aunt and my mother-in-law are under the shelling and I
*03:09.840- 03:18.960* :  must go and get them. I'm just walking in the street. I don't know where to come or go. They say
*03:18.960- 03:25.280* :  that we should go somewhere safe. There is nowhere safe. There is no area that is safe. This is not
*03:25.280- 03:30.240* :  a life. Just before we recorded this podcast, I got the latest on the movements of those Israeli
*03:30.240- 03:34.440* :  military tanks in Raffa from our Middle East correspondent, Yola Nell, in Jerusalem.
*03:35.060- 03:38.740* :  We've not heard anything officially from the Israeli military about the movements of its ground
*03:38.740- 03:44.320* :  troops, but we've got witnesses in Raffa telling us that they have now reached the heart of the
*03:44.320- 03:49.360* :  city, really. They allow the roundabout. That's a key landmark. One witness told us that there
*03:49.360- 03:54.740* :  was a sniper or any sniper's setup on a tall building. We haven't got a full confirmation of
*03:54.740- 03:59.120* :  exactly what is happening there. We do know as well that there were reports earlier that
*03:59.120- 04:04.360* :  Israeli forces had seized control of the highest hilltop along the Gaza-Egypt border this area
*04:04.540- 04:10.560* :  that's known as the Philadelphia Corridor. A large part of this corridor, strategically important,
*04:10.560- 04:16.360* :  of course, now under Israeli control. There were reported being gun battles with Hamas-led fighters
*04:16.360- 04:22.800* :  there. We also know that there was overnight a shootout between Egyptian soldiers along the
*04:22.800- 04:29.140* :  border and Israeli soldiers resulted in one Egyptian officer being killed. In general,
*04:30.060- 04:35.880* :  intense Israeli air strikes artillery fire that went on overnight. People told us it was
*04:35.880- 04:41.220* :  terrifying that they got up early this morning from homes in the west of Raffa. Thousands of
*04:41.220- 04:45.740* :  people could be seen fleeing from that part of the city, piling up their possessions in those
*04:45.740- 04:51.660* :  scenes, have become all too familiar from Gaza. People also moving from that tent camp
*04:52.080- 04:57.980* :  tell us, Sultan, where there was this deadly Israeli bombing on Sunday that ignited a huge blaze
*04:57.980- 05:03.800* :  there. What the Israeli Prime Minister has called a tragic mishap. The UN Security Council are
*05:03.800- 05:09.080* :  meeting to talk about this later, although Israel seems undaunted by any level of international
*05:09.080- 05:14.800* :  condemnation. Yeah, so we have this meeting taking place behind closed doors later. It was called by
*05:14.800- 05:21.740* :  Algeria in response to that deadly air strike on Sunday night. The UN has already called for a
*05:21.740- 05:27.760* :  full and transparent investigation into what happened. We had last week the top UN courts
*05:27.760- 05:33.920* :  basically ordering Israel to stop its Raffa offensive, although it argues that there is some scope
*05:33.920- 05:39.840* :  for military action left by the wording of the ruling. And on the world stage, you know, Israel
*05:39.840- 05:45.360* :  does just look more and more isolated. Yellow now with me from Jerusalem. Meanwhile,
*05:45.360- 05:50.860* :  Spain, Ireland and Norway have all officially recognized the state of Palestine. It was an
*05:50.860- 05:56.380* :  initiative begun by the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. With this decision, Spain joins
*05:56.380- 06:04.720* :  the more than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine. This is a historic decision that
*06:04.720- 06:10.220* :  has a single goal to contribute to achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
*06:11.100- 06:15.340* :  But it may not be enough for these people who are among hundreds of pro-Palestinian protestors
*06:15.340- 06:20.480* :  who gathered on Monday in Barcelona and Madrid. We need more from the state of Spain. We don't
*06:20.480- 06:25.440* :  want only the declaration of a Palestinian state because that's something more symbolic than
*06:25.440- 06:30.320* :  anything. We ask for the government to cut relations with the state of Israel. Not just that,
*06:30.320- 06:34.400* :  we want them to stop selling and buying arms from the state of Israel because that makes
*06:34.400- 06:41.100* :  Spain complex of the genocide that is going on in Palestine. The next step is a blockage to Israel
*06:41.740- 06:45.920* :  and then starting negotiations to recognize the both states in the same territory.
*06:46.420- 06:51.700* :  Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have welcomed the recognition. Israel's Foreign Affairs Minister
*06:51.700- 06:54.260* :  Israel Katz shared a video on X.
*06:58.460- 07:04.040* :  Mixed images of flamenco dancers with Hamas fighters attacking Israel on the 7th of October
*07:04.540- 07:08.620* :  with a message to the Spanish President that Hamas thanks him for his service.
*07:08.620- 07:14.040* :  Israel has accused all three countries of rewarding terrorism and has withdrawn its ambassadors.
*07:14.560- 07:20.320* :  Our correspondent in Madrid is Guy Hedgeko. Mr Sanchez has been very keen to promote this initiative
*07:20.320- 07:25.820* :  and we saw him there speaking in English that reflects how significant he feels this is. He said
*07:25.820- 07:30.480* :  he had to speak in Spanish and English because it was such an internationally important moment.
*07:30.740- 07:35.300* :  Mr Sanchez has argued that it reflects public opinion and polls do suggest that.
*07:35.300- 07:40.060* :  In terms of the political reaction, broadly I suppose you could say it does have support
*07:40.060- 07:44.360* :  certainly from the left and his allies on the left are very much in support of this. In fact,
*07:44.360- 07:49.080* :  many think that this announcement should have been made previously. On the right it's a little
*07:49.080- 07:54.400* :  more complicated. The main conservative people's party says it does support a two-state solution
*07:55.020- 07:59.040* :  but it has criticized him for the way that he's gone about this. It says he's gone about it too
*07:59.040- 08:03.920* :  fast and that's why he hasn't got more support from other countries. And they also say he's
*08:03.920- 08:09.160* :  been trying to subhog the limelight as well. The feeling is that above all this is a symbolic move.
*08:09.160- 08:14.620* :  And I think what Pedro Sanchez and his government hope is that this will somehow encourage other
*08:14.620- 08:19.740* :  countries, particularly in Europe, to take similar steps in the near future.
*08:44.340- 08:48.080* :  People are still grappling with how to reverse the geography of apartheid,
*08:48.140- 08:53.880* :  the white minority rule, which determine where and how people lived. Our Africa correspondent
*08:53.880- 08:58.460* :  Barbara Platt Usher has been to Cape Town where the contrasts are particularly stark.
*09:03.160- 09:06.720* :  This is an afternoon Arabic lesson, practice for reading the Quran.
*09:09.300- 09:14.760* :  Children are clustered around two tables in a long room. They're in a derelict hospital
*09:14.760- 09:20.040* :  that's under occupation by people who got tired of waiting for government housing and took
*09:20.040- 09:25.600* :  matters into their own hands. Jamila Davids is one of them. I found something and I ended up in
*09:25.600- 09:29.980* :  the old morgue office and everyone's like, why are you living in the morgue? I said, do you know
*09:29.980- 09:35.060* :  what? It's home now. It's a place I can call home. Another resident, Feldila Peterson,
*09:35.180- 09:41.440* :  shows me how she's transformed a bathroom into a home. It was a toilet before. It was a toilet?
*09:41.440- 09:47.340* :  Yes. And now when you have a kitchen, I have a kitchen in one of the toilets. Yes. This place
*09:47.340- 09:57.160* :  actually gave me a bit of more home, like a homecoming. I was evicted like 10 times in a year,
*09:57.300- 10:05.080* :  but living in this occupation gave me that opportunity to look my life a bit better.
*10:05.080- 10:10.780* :  And it's much more nearer to the city ASMR. And that's the point. This is all about location.
*10:11.760- 10:16.860* :  So we have probably around about 1,500 people living here.
*10:17.580- 10:21.880* :  Bevel Lucas is one of the social rights activists who organized the hospital takeover.
*10:22.260- 10:28.440* :  It was occupation for the purpose of being centrally located. It's close to the city center.
*10:28.720- 10:32.580* :  It's close to economic activities. It's close to transport.
*10:36.360- 10:41.280* :  Under apartheid, racist laws banished black and colored people to the peripheries of cities.
*10:42.180- 10:48.300* :  Now they have the right to move, but many can't afford to. The ANC government has built housing,
*10:48.300- 10:53.740* :  but most of it far from the city center where land is cheaper, which has served to reinforce
*10:53.740- 10:59.300* :  the geography of apartheid. Cape Town really is probably the most segregated urban area
*10:59.300- 11:04.900* :  anywhere on earth. So I mean still today not a single affordable home has been built in the
*11:04.900- 11:12.940* :  inner city of Cape Town. Nick Budlander is an urban policy researcher. He's giving me a tour of
*11:12.940- 11:18.740* :  parking lots that store government vehicles identified by activists as available public land that
*11:18.740- 11:23.520* :  could be transformed into low income housing. This one really irritates me because it's just
*11:23.520- 11:29.540* :  full with broken cars. I think it's an absolutely egregious example that in an area like this
*11:29.540- 11:34.920* :  that so many people would benefit from living in, the decision is rather to just have cars covered
*11:34.920- 11:44.200* :  in dust. There are signs of a new government approach. I'm now at another former hospital site and
*11:44.200- 11:49.160* :  there is construction going on here because the provincial government is building low-cost housing
*11:49.160- 11:54.120* :  just a few kilometers from the city center. Some have already been completed and people have
*11:54.120- 11:59.540* :  moved in and are paying low rents, but really this is just a drop in the bucket compared to what's
*11:59.580- 12:03.960* :  needed. The section we are working now is affordable housing, which is a rental option.
*12:03.960- 12:09.680* :  The provincial infrastructure minister, Tertius Simmers, acknowledges a backlog of 600,000 people
*12:09.680- 12:15.220* :  waiting for housing assistance, but says they're working on it. We are very ambitious for our next five
*12:15.420- 12:21.780* :  year cycle of in terms of delivery. We have 29 social housing projects submitted to this plan
*12:21.780- 12:27.840* :  within our project pipeline at various stages. But the budgets are small and timelines uncertain.
*12:34.240- 12:39.000* :  It's Saturday morning in Kailija Township, which is several kilometers outside of Cape Town,
*12:39.000- 12:44.480* :  sounds like the church services have already started. There are rows and rows and rows of
*12:44.480- 12:49.160* :  shacks made of corrugated iron, also rows of public latrines. People are getting water from a
*12:49.160- 12:57.860* :  communal tap. Noliema Tertecoma has lived in a shack here for most of her 49 years. She spends a
*12:57.880- 13:03.340* :  quarter of her meager salary on transport to her job in the city, and she does not expect the
*13:21.100- 13:24.540* :  election to change that. The end of apartheid did bring political rights and freedoms for all,
*13:25.280- 13:31.220* :  but on the eve of South Africa's seventh democratic election and during inequality still divides
*13:31.220- 13:38.280* :  this country. Police in Hong Kong have arrested six people for writing messages, which the authorities
*13:38.280- 13:44.180* :  say advocated rebellion against the state. The arrests of five women and one man are the first of
*13:44.180- 13:49.660* :  their kind under the Chinese territory's own security law. Here's Celia Hatton. The arrest
*13:49.760- 13:55.720* :  come ahead of a politically sensitive date in Hong Kong and mainland China, June 4. In the past,
*13:55.720- 14:01.740* :  before Hong Kong tightened its security laws to outlaw political dissent, thousands of people would
*14:01.740- 14:08.360* :  gather in Hong Kong to remember pro-democracy demonstrators killed near Beijing's Tiananmen Square on
*14:08.360- 14:15.300* :  June 4, 1989. Such commemorative events have now been deemed illegal. The authorities say those
*14:15.300- 14:21.620* :  arrested on Tuesday include the noted political activist Chow Hong Tong, who was part of a group
*14:21.620- 14:28.320* :  dedicated to remembering June 4. Ms. Chow, who's already behind bars, is accused of pushing the
*14:28.320- 14:33.360* :  others to share messages connected with a sensitive date. Celia Hatton reporting.
*14:35.280- 14:39.480* :  Stottacan, a special report from the besieged Ukrainian city of Harkiv.
*14:42.660- 14:48.640* :  Russia was not a terrorist state, but they hit civilian places now too. The Russians are killing
*14:48.640- 14:51.720* :  civilians and we have nothing to defend ourselves.

*16:07.060- 16:12.020* :  As we record this podcast, Georgia's Parliament is expected to push through its divisive foreign
*16:12.020- 16:16.340* :  agents law and move many seers to step away from the west and towards Russia.
*16:16.940- 16:21.340* :  The policy sparked weeks of protests. It's already received a presidential veto,
*16:21.820- 16:25.320* :  but the ruling Georgian Dream Party has been saying it'll overturn that.
*16:25.880- 16:30.440* :  Opponents of the law fear it could be used to stifle dissent and make it impossible for Georgia
*16:30.440- 16:36.840* :  to join the European Union. Our whole future is at stake. If we're not with Europe, we have no
*16:36.840- 16:43.000* :  other choice. It's either Europe or nothing. I think actually today is one of the worst days
*16:43.000- 16:50.040* :  of Georgian history, so even though we're on a fighting mode to fight the Russian law till the end,
*16:50.360- 16:56.640* :  I think all of us are a bit of said because seeing that it is all done by Georgian hands is super
*16:56.640- 17:01.880* :  hard. We've got to say no for Russia because Europe is only choice for us and our future should be
*17:02.400- 17:07.080* :  European. With the vote imminent, I spoke to you, Rayhanda Meetri outside the Parliament building
*17:07.080- 17:14.900* :  into Bliese. They are here, the protesters. It's hard to tell how many are here. They're making
*17:14.900- 17:22.680* :  quite a lot of noise. There's also quite a lot of police on side and at this stage, most of the
*17:22.680- 17:28.960* :  protesters are kind of at the back entrance to the Parliament. Very poor mobile connection here,
*17:28.960- 17:35.260* :  but still I can see a lot of people are trying to watch on their phones what's happening inside
*17:35.260- 17:44.240* :  Parliament. This vote to override the presidential veto is to happen any minute now, and they know
*17:44.240- 17:49.980* :  that the governing Georgian Dream Party will override this veto because that's what they've been
*17:49.980- 17:56.160* :  announcing over and over again. We're asking protesters, so what's next for you? What are you
*17:56.160- 18:01.480* :  going to do? You've been protesting for more than six weeks and they're saying that the only
*18:01.780- 18:08.100* :  way for them is to continue their protest because this is not just about the law. It is about
*18:08.100- 18:14.940* :  Georgian future and those who are protesting against this law, they want to see the future of their
*18:14.940- 18:21.300* :  country in Europe and they believe that if this law is enacted in Georgia, it will suppress
*18:21.920- 18:27.240* :  dissent, it will suppress critical voices. They call it the Russian law because of the similarities
*18:27.240- 18:32.800* :  with the foreign agents law in Russia and they just don't want to see the same thing happen here.
*18:33.420- 18:38.480* :  And barring the government changing its mind, which seems unlikely, is that it when the
*18:38.480- 18:44.240* :  presidential veto is overturned any moment as we expect, it becomes law and that's that people
*18:44.240- 18:50.040* :  can protest if they want to. Most of the non-governmental organisations and independent media that
*18:50.460- 18:59.240* :  this law would target, they have already said that they won't comply, they disagree with it and
*18:59.240- 19:06.060* :  it means that perhaps a lot of non-governmental organisations will be shot. All of this is happening
*19:06.060- 19:12.320* :  just months before the parliamentary elections in October. Right, Dimitri, with me from Tbilisi.
*19:12.940- 19:18.400* :  Belgium has become the latest European country to say it will send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine as
*19:18.400- 19:23.560* :  part of a package of aid worth nearly a billion dollars. The Netherlands, Denmark and Norway have
*19:23.560- 19:29.240* :  already promised to send F-16s to help Ukraine fend off Russian attacks. The Belgian Prime Minister
*19:29.240- 19:36.000* :  Alexander de Kru made the commitment send 30 jets stressing the urgency. Let me be very clear,
*19:36.320- 19:43.860* :  Ukraine can only push back the invader if we provide more and if we provide better arms and if
*19:43.860- 19:51.900* :  we are able to do it in a faster pace. As Europeans, as NATO members, we fully acknowledge the need
*19:51.900- 19:57.400* :  for that and we fully acknowledge your demand for that. Russia has been increasing the military
*19:57.400- 20:03.520* :  pressure on Ukraine and particularly the country's second city, Harkiv, two guided bombs destroyed a
*20:03.520- 20:08.800* :  shop and a garden centre crowded with people on Saturday. Our international editor Jeremy Bowen
*20:08.800- 20:12.020* :  reports from the city, which is feeling very much under siege.
*20:14.780- 20:20.620* :  Well, we're in the cellar under our hotel in Harkiv because there have been a number of big
*20:20.620- 20:25.840* :  explosions and there have been reports as well of ballistic missiles coming into the city,
*20:25.840- 20:31.040* :  so we're taking cover. Once we get the all clear, we're going to head over to the scene.
*20:33.180- 20:37.880* :  So I've got inside the print works. That was hit in the Russian attack. The roofs gone,
*20:37.880- 20:43.380* :  they're smoked. I don't know why the Russians hit this place, but what is absolutely certain is
*20:43.380- 20:48.980* :  that the Ukrainians weren't able to stop them. Not one of the missiles was intercepted. The war
*20:48.980- 20:53.640* :  right now is about how it choices for Ukraine because they're fighting an enemy that
*20:53.820- 20:58.140* :  realises their weaknesses and has worked out how to exploit them.
*21:00.020- 21:04.220* :  Days after the attack, Elena Lupak, one of the workers at the plant, was still in hospital,
*21:04.860- 21:11.740* :  battered and cut by blast and shrapnel. Her hair was badly singed where it had caught fire,
*21:12.240- 21:16.020* :  and Elena, for the first time in the war, was terrified.
*21:16.400- 21:23.120* :  Listen, listen, I hope the Russia was not a terrorist state and would only attack military
*21:23.740- 21:30.620* :  targets, but they hit civilian places now too, and I'm really scared. The Russians are killing
*21:30.620- 21:36.360* :  civilians, and we have nothing to defend ourselves. And the Russians are not very far away,
*21:36.360- 21:41.520* :  the border is close. They're hitting her cave. Is it worse than this time last year?
*21:43.660- 21:48.020* :  This is the middle of the war. It's not like it was at the beginning,
*21:48.060- 21:52.020* :  but this is not the end. We are still in the middle of it.
*21:52.720- 21:55.920* :  We're bumping along an improvised road through a field.
*21:56.940- 22:03.800* :  They can see massive plumes of smoke coming from Vlokchansk. That's the place
*22:04.500- 22:11.440* :  which has been the center of the fighting. There are multiple fires burning. I can see that black
*22:11.460- 22:18.160* :  smoke towering into the sky. It must be pretty hellish to be in the mercifully way, we are
*22:18.900- 22:19.700* :  far away from it.
*22:24.260- 22:28.200* :  Devika, the psychologist, has a conversation with the lady behind the gate. What do they say?
*22:28.620- 22:33.160* :  So she perspires her to leave. She says she'll get any kind of support. She needs anything.
*22:33.920- 22:38.960* :  She needs. She doesn't want to go. Very dangerous to stay here. Please go to this leave.
*22:38.960- 22:44.440* :  It's get to mind my dangers. So a few streets away in the village, there's
*22:44.480- 22:50.620* :  Liu Bov. She's an elderly woman. She's packed and ready to go after more than 40 years in the same
*22:50.620- 23:01.220* :  house. Leaving hurts my soul. She told me, but the shelling made sleep impossible and it was so close
*23:01.220- 23:08.760* :  that all her windows were smashed. Thank you. Be back soon. We'll see. It depends on if it's
*23:08.760- 23:13.220* :  russians or Ukrainians here. That's going to make my decision for me.
*23:15.420- 23:20.500* :  Paki isn't just a city of war. It's a beautiful early summer day.
*23:20.500- 23:27.860* :  Cafés are open and outside the opera house. Boys are skateboarding on the stone steps practicing
*23:27.860- 23:38.200* :  jumps and inside they're still playing music. They've improvised a war theater and the orchestra
*23:38.200- 23:45.580* :  is here rehearsing for a music festival, but that can't obscure Ukraine's real challenges and
*23:45.580- 23:51.220* :  the tenacity and the strength of the russians and the hard summer that lies ahead.
*23:54.600- 24:00.360* :  Jeremy Bowen reporting from Harciff. Pope Francis has been heard using a highly derogatory term
*24:00.360- 24:04.940* :  for gay people. He was speaking a week ago in a private meeting with Italian bishops.
*24:04.940- 24:10.640* :  As we record this podcast, the Vatican has issued a statement saying the Pope didn't intend to use
*24:10.640- 24:16.640* :  homophobic language and apologises to anyone offended. Our religion editor Ali Muck Bull reports on
*24:16.640- 24:22.120* :  the incident. When asked of the Italian bishops' conference if gay men should now be allowed to
*24:22.120- 24:27.820* :  train for the priesthood as long as they remain celibate, Pope Francis is reported to have said no,
*24:28.440- 24:34.440* :  saying there was in the church already too much of an heir of an Italian fraccadiene,
*24:34.980- 24:39.380* :  which translates as an extremely offensive reference to homosexual behaviour.
*24:40.160- 24:44.020* :  There were said to have been shocked at the Pope's language during the closed doors meeting,
*24:44.020- 24:49.920* :  particularly as he has in public talked of being respectful towards gay people. Progressive
*24:49.920- 24:54.600* :  supporters of the Pope have long argued that while little has tangibly changed in terms of gay
*24:54.600- 24:59.220* :  rights and Catholicism, Pope Francis has changed the tone of the church's attitude.
*24:59.980- 25:05.840* :  Our religion editor Ali Muck Bull. Sri Lanka's economy is on track to stabilise this year after
*25:05.840- 25:10.780* :  a severe financial crisis which plunged a quarter of the country into poverty, but the government
*25:10.780- 25:16.260* :  is far concerned by ordering the country's tea producers to increase wages by 70 percent.
*25:16.720- 25:21.720* :  Plantation companies are worried it will make their tea uncompetitive. So how important is tea
*25:21.720- 25:26.600* :  to the Sri Lankan economy? Victoria O'Hunder spoke to our business correspondent Monica Miller.
*25:27.220- 25:33.260* :  It is massive. It is $1.3 billion worth of sale on tea and it employs about
*25:34.480- 25:44.340* :  615,000 workers and the Sri Lanka annually exports about 95 percent of roughly about 250 million
*25:44.340- 25:49.980* :  kilos of tea it produces. So the government has ordered its workers salaries to be increased to
*25:49.980- 25:57.660* :  $5.66 in US dollars per day. Now that is from what they are currently being paid of $3.33
*25:57.660- 26:03.300* :  which the industry says will increase tea production and cost by about 45 percent. However,
*26:03.300- 26:08.520* :  representatives of the plantations say that this increase is going to make it much much harder
*26:08.520- 26:14.000* :  to compete against its key rivals India and Kenya which have lower prices and higher productivity.
*26:14.060- 26:19.280* :  So the industry needs to start paying these increases according to the government starting next
*26:19.320- 26:24.100* :  month. So we have talked so many times here on the program about the challenges that have been
*26:24.100- 26:28.780* :  and struggles that Sri Lankan economy has been going through for the last few years.
*26:29.140- 26:35.760* :  Just remind us briefly those challenges. Well, the fallout from Sri Lanka's financial crisis.
*26:35.760- 26:41.680* :  I mean, this goes back to last year. Actually, you know, it had been building up that there were
*26:41.680- 26:49.240* :  some issues with fallouts from foreign exchange in 2022 that's leader at the time. Mr.
*26:49.240- 26:55.140* :  Rajapaksa had left the country because there just wasn't currencies. The US dollar they ran out
*26:55.140- 27:00.260* :  of which was paying things for import fuel. Medical supplies. There were food shortages.
*27:01.500- 27:08.540* :  Incredibly bad. And that was after the COVID pandemic. Now, do you recognize this?
*27:14.720- 27:20.880* :  This is the sound of the Routon clan formed in Staten Island, New York in 1992. And widely
*27:20.880- 27:24.220* :  regarded as one of the most influential hip hop bands of all time.
*27:29.740- 27:35.340* :  Now a unique CD by the collective whose members include Method Man, Inspector Deck and Ghost Face
*27:36.300- 27:40.360* :  is being given top billing at a museum on the other side of the world in Tasmania.
*27:40.900- 27:44.140* :  I asked Tiffany Turnbull in Sydney, what's so special about the album?
*27:44.780- 27:52.420* :  It's housed in this ornate silver box inside is apparently a CD, the only copy of this album
*27:52.420- 27:59.540* :  in the world. It comes with a leather bound book of lyrics. And it's been learned to this museum
*27:59.540- 28:04.480* :  in Tasmania where it will be put on physical display, but it'll also be played for a select
*28:04.480- 28:09.680* :  number of people. And the idea as I understand it of the album was this sort of rebellion against
*28:09.680- 28:15.760* :  streaming, which the band thought made music to widely available, less of a precious commodity?
*28:16.240- 28:20.780* :  Yeah. The band has said that they wanted to kind of take it back to a 400-year-old
*28:20.780- 28:26.060* :  Renaissance style approach to music, where they were offering this really highly sought-after
*28:26.060- 28:32.460* :  commodity. Their producer likened it to Picasso artwork or an ancient Egyptian artifact.
*28:32.460- 28:37.240* :  And the museum says that they're helping this vision come to life, because obviously,
*28:37.780- 28:42.260* :  only a few people will be able to listen to it, but it'll also be housed alongside all of these
*28:42.260- 28:47.820* :  other pieces of fine art, where it belongs, the museum says. And the value of it makes it very
*28:47.820- 28:55.620* :  elite, very inaccessible to most people. Yeah, so because it is so rare being literally the only
*28:55.620- 29:02.640* :  copy of this album at all, it sold for two million dollars way back in 2015, and that went to
*29:02.640- 29:09.580* :  Martin Shrely, the disgraced former pharmaceutical executive. And when his assets were seized,
*29:09.580- 29:15.800* :  it was sold again, reportedly for about double that. So it is the most expensive album ever sold.
*29:16.120- 29:21.380* :  Unsurprising it was recorded in New York, but maybe more surprising, it's ended up in Tasmania.
*29:21.380- 29:26.840* :  Why there? Well, the museum that's putting on this exhibit is very well known for, I guess,
*29:26.840- 29:32.980* :  stunts like this, exhibitions that make people think. And that museum in Hobart called the
*29:32.980- 29:39.820* :  Museum of Old and New Art, they're doing a exhibition about name dropping, which is about status and
*29:39.820- 29:46.880* :  notoriety and celebrity. And the curator said that he couldn't think of anything else that he
*29:46.880- 29:52.920* :  wanted more than this, this album that could demonstrate those themes. Tiffany Turnbull with me from
