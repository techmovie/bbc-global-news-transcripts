*01:21.060- 01:23.480* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.680- 01:30.480* :  I'm Nick Mars and at 13 hours GMT on Friday, the 31st of May, these are our main stories.
*01:31.080- 01:35.920* :  There's been a furious reaction among US Republicans after Donald Trump was found guilty
*01:35.920- 01:42.380* :  of falsifying business records. Kuala Lumpur Airport is crammed as thousands of would-be guest
*01:42.460- 01:46.980* :  workers are trying to have their documents processed ahead of a deadline in Malaysia.
*01:47.780- 01:52.540* :  Coalition talks are expected to get underway in South Africa after an inconclusive election
*01:52.580- 02:00.580* :  the first in three decades. Also in this podcast we'll have a special report from Mexico where voters
*02:00.580- 02:05.780* :  are almost certain to choose the first female president on Sunday. The biggest challenge for
*02:05.780- 02:11.320* :  the winner lies ahead in undoing centuries of sexism, gender inequality and violence in one of
*02:11.320- 02:17.460* :  the most patriarchal societies in the Americas. All that and the New York Times takes legal action
*02:17.460- 02:22.940* :  against attempts to register a game with a similar name to the online game Wordl.
*02:26.280- 02:31.600* :  On the East Coast of America, the morning news shows are still buzzing with speculation after
*02:31.600- 02:37.520* :  Donald Trump's guilty verdicts in New York on Thursday. He's become the first US president,
*02:37.520- 02:43.800* :  former or serving to be convicted of a criminal offence, falsifying business records to cover
*02:43.800- 02:49.660* :  up a hush money payment to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. His conviction, which he's likely
*02:49.660- 02:54.640* :  to appeal, does not disqualify him from running in this November's presidential election,
*02:55.160- 03:00.540* :  even if he's sent to prison when he's sentenced in July. The BBC's John Sudworth is following
*03:00.540- 03:08.560* :  the story in New York. In a nearby park, Mr Trump's opponents celebrated
*03:12.180- 03:16.140* :  while inside the court, the former president was making history
*03:18.400- 03:21.020* :  as the first ever to be convicted of a crime.
*03:22.380- 03:28.560* :  This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt.
*03:28.620- 03:34.900* :  There's a rigged trial and disgrace. It wouldn't give us a venue change.
*03:35.140- 03:42.160* :  But it was a jury who convicted him on the evidence. 34 counts of falsifying business records
*03:42.160- 03:47.880* :  to disguise hush money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels. For the purpose, prosecutors
*03:47.880- 03:54.420* :  said of keeping her claim that there had sex from the American public just ahead of the 2016
*04:00.860- 04:05.660* :  election. The verdict brought only gloom to Mr Trump's supporters who were left repeating
*04:05.660- 04:13.240* :  those claims of political persecution. The rulers used their powers to go after their political
*04:13.240- 04:20.660* :  opponents and they're afraid of a much more popular opponent, which they know will defeat them.
*04:21.020- 04:27.020* :  But this was a decision made by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, your fellow citizens.
*04:27.100- 04:34.000* :  There's nothing political about that, is there? I'm going to say that the jury was tainted,
*04:34.000- 04:39.260* :  but who knows? So despite the sense of despondency amongst the Trump supporters,
*04:39.960- 04:44.400* :  it's all pretty good nature here, although there's a pretty large police presence just in case.
*04:45.140- 04:50.680* :  The bigger question, though, is what the reactions going to be longer term with America now in
*04:50.680- 04:56.140* :  uncharted territory? Remember, we're going to win. We're all winners. We're going to win so big.
*04:56.160- 04:59.540* :  We're going to make it bigger and better than ever before. Remember that.
*05:00.960- 05:07.480* :  What effect will it have on his candidacy? Will it put those crucial undecided voters off
*05:08.000- 05:13.800* :  or draw them to him? And what about the impact of his attacks on America's institution,
*05:13.820- 05:19.920* :  already intensifying in the wake of the verdict with his campaign releasing an advert,
*05:20.440- 05:25.500* :  calling him a political prisoner? Good evening, first and foremost, and I want to thank the jury
*05:25.500- 05:31.100* :  for its service. The man who brought the case, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg,
*05:31.460- 05:37.200* :  insisted the result was assigned the justice system is working. While this defendant may be
*05:37.320- 05:43.360* :  unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today at this verdict
*05:43.420- 05:49.600* :  in the same manner as every other case that comes to the courtroom doors by following the facts
*05:49.620- 05:54.020* :  and the law in doing so without fear or favor.
*05:58.180- 06:03.640* :  Mr. Trump will be sentenced in early July and is unlikely legal experts say to go to jail.
*06:04.400- 06:10.660* :  Either way though, one half of a divided country now has a convicted criminal as its candidate.
*06:11.820- 06:16.700* :  John Sudworth. We heard Donald Trump protesting his innocence there and calling the judge
*06:16.700- 06:22.640* :  corrupt. He said the trial was rigged and called the ruling a disgrace. He'll almost certainly
*06:22.640- 06:28.660* :  appeal a process that could take months or even longer. For the sentencing on July 11th,
*06:28.660- 06:33.120* :  the judge will have several factors to consider, including Donald Trump's age.
*06:33.120- 06:38.920* :  The sentence could involve a fine probation or supervision or possibly prison time.
*06:38.920- 06:43.860* :  My colleague Nick Robinson spoke to Shanlon Wu, a former US federal prosecutor,
*06:44.280- 06:47.660* :  and he asked him about the slim possibility he could be sent to jail.
*06:48.140- 06:52.880* :  I would say it seems a little bit unlikely. The New York system for determining a sentence
*06:52.940- 06:58.420* :  leads a lot of discretion to the judge and normally judges take into account if there's a criminal
*06:58.420- 07:04.760* :  history and he does not have a criminal history. But something to consider in terms of whether the
*07:04.760- 07:10.940* :  sentence could be harsh enough to include prison time is during the trial, we may recall that he
*07:10.940- 07:18.440* :  had a lot of outspoken issues that violated the gag order. The judge was not very happy about that
*07:18.600- 07:24.980* :  and did not actually do anything at the time. That can be factored in when it comes to the sentencing
*07:24.980- 07:29.260* :  as well as the fact that there are actually three other cases involving felonies,
*07:29.260- 07:34.660* :  two federal ones and one state one in Georgia that are still pending. Even though this is a
*07:34.660- 07:40.900* :  defendant now convicted who has no previous criminal convictions, he does have a simultaneous
*07:41.460- 07:45.200* :  contemporaneous criminal history right now. The criticism of the trial process
*07:45.200- 07:51.260* :  attacks on the judge might just persuade that judge to send him to prison, you think?
*07:51.580- 07:57.140* :  Well, it might. The judges seem pretty even keeled, so I don't think he'll take it too personally,
*07:57.140- 08:03.960* :  but I think the judge was very offended by what he felt is Trump's lack of respect for the system.
*08:03.960- 08:09.360* :  It's very unusual for a defendant to mount these kinds of attacks on people, the judge,
*08:09.360- 08:14.180* :  the judge's family, the prosecutor. I mean, it's unprecedented in some ways because most
*08:14.180- 08:17.800* :  defendants don't want to be hurting themselves that way, shooting themselves in the foot,
*08:17.800- 08:24.620* :  insulting the judge, but it also reveals a lot of contempt for the system and a lot of disrespect
*08:24.620- 08:30.040* :  for it. And I think the judge did not like that. Trump's attorney say that they will appeal,
*08:30.040- 08:36.140* :  they insisted he could never, of course, affair trial under that judge and in that location in
*08:36.140- 08:41.000* :  Manhattan, in other words, what prospects are there of that appeal being successful.
*08:42.140- 08:49.200* :  I think on those prospects very, very poor, the idea that the jurisdiction is too liberal to
*08:49.200- 08:53.900* :  give them a fair trial, that's really going nowhere. You almost could never win with that,
*08:53.900- 08:58.320* :  you'd have to be using statistics like how many Democrats are there in the jurisdiction. That's
*08:58.320- 09:04.340* :  just going no place fast. And the way that the judge conducted the trial was very fair,
*09:04.340- 09:08.980* :  so I don't think they're going to make much headway with that. They may have a couple of
*09:09.020- 09:15.160* :  more interesting legal issues to argue on the appeal, such as the way that the prosecution
*09:15.160- 09:21.140* :  combined the falsification of business records with an election interference charge. That's
*09:21.140- 09:26.020* :  relatively novel. There's some permutations of that before, but these exact circumstances
*09:27.060- 09:31.420* :  first time that's happened. So they might be able to do something with that when you combine it
*09:31.440- 09:36.740* :  with the idea that maybe the definitions, the so-called instructions given to the jury,
*09:37.320- 09:42.500* :  might be challenged to say, oh, you caused this to be too confusing and maybe they got it wrong.
*09:42.560- 09:47.320* :  So they might have some traction there, but things like saying New York is too liberal to get
*09:47.320- 09:53.360* :  a fair trial, or this judge was very biased against him. The records are just not going to support
*09:53.360- 09:58.880* :  that at all. That was the former US federal prosecutor, Shannon Wu, speaking to Nick Robinson.
*09:59.800- 10:04.160* :  So how will all this impact Donald Trump's running for the White House this November?
*10:04.600- 10:07.380* :  I got the latest from my correspondent in New York, Nitorthic.
*10:33.900- 10:40.540* :  Really in full damage control mode. They've taken to social media, to the airwaves, to hit at the
*10:40.540- 10:46.680* :  judge claiming he's kind of conflicted, that the jury was made up of all liberals and calling for
*10:46.680- 10:52.600* :  revenge. And we've just had a truth social post by Donald Trump. He's saying that this was a
*10:52.600- 10:58.120* :  witch hunt, a common claim by Donald Trump, but it's interesting to see him end his post by saying,
*10:58.120- 11:04.000* :  if this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. Donald Trump and the Republicans are trying to
*11:04.000- 11:09.760* :  make this about an attack on his supporters to try to rally them and others ahead of the election.
*11:10.280- 11:14.900* :  Very interesting. Are you getting a sense that there might be some worried Democrats thinking that
*11:14.900- 11:24.600* :  it might give Mr. Trump a boost to come November? Look, I think nobody knows what could happen.
*11:25.420- 11:31.220* :  Never before, it's unprecedented to have a convicted felon represent a major party before an
*11:31.220- 11:36.000* :  election as tight as this. I think Democrats now are trying to figure out their messaging.
*11:36.000- 11:41.500* :  How heavily do they mean into attacking Donald Trump? Or how much do they stick with
*11:42.640- 11:48.340* :  you know, talking about abortion, talking about the threat to democracy if Donald Trump gets in
*11:48.680- 11:55.180* :  to the White House? I think there's going to be a mix. We are still months out and so they're
*11:55.180- 12:01.880* :  going to hope that voters still remember this verdict and it doesn't lose its power,
*12:01.880- 12:08.340* :  but certainly for Democrats, they don't want to see people questioning the criminal justice system
*12:08.520- 12:13.320* :  and buying into Donald Trump's lines of attack. I'm briefly netting it. It will stay in the public
*12:13.320- 12:18.040* :  eye. It's possibly going to be an appeal. There will be a sentencing. That's right. Donald Trump
*12:18.040- 12:23.280* :  is saying he wants to appeal this. His lawyers have promised that. That will be a long process that
*12:23.280- 12:28.960* :  will go past election day, but yes, Donald Trump is going to be his sentence July 11th just days
*12:28.960- 12:35.280* :  before he is crowned officially as the Republican nominee at the Republican Convention. So this
*12:35.280- 12:41.380* :  will continue to dog Donald Trump. Net atopic in New York. Now to Kuala Lumpur.
*12:44.320- 12:49.100* :  And that is the sound of the airport in the Malaysian capital where thousands of foreign
*12:49.100- 12:54.200* :  migrant workers are attempting to get their documents processed before Saturday that the
*12:54.200- 12:59.920* :  government will no longer approve new arrivals from then. I asked our Asia Pacific editor Mickey
*12:59.920- 13:05.520* :  Bristo more about that deadline. Yeah, that sounds like any busy airport, doesn't it? But actually,
*13:05.520- 13:12.140* :  if you see the video of hundreds and hundreds of people sat on the ground, crowding corridors,
*13:12.140- 13:18.040* :  crowding waiting areas, just essentially waiting for their papers to be processed for themselves
*13:18.220- 13:24.720* :  health check to get inside Malaysia. You know, you alluded to that deadline. Now that's today,
*13:24.720- 13:31.460* :  Friday, May 31st, when the Malaysian government has said afterwards it will accept no more guest
*13:31.540- 13:37.360* :  workers or migrant workers into the country. That's because it hopes to carry out some kind of
*13:37.360- 13:43.000* :  assessment, already two million migrant workers or more than two million migrant workers inside the
*13:43.000- 13:48.340* :  country. The government wants to assess to see how many more the economy might need before allowing
*13:48.340- 13:53.740* :  any more in. So that's led to a big rush of people trying to get in just before this deadline.
*13:53.900- 13:58.680* :  Yeah, less than four hours to go at 8 o'clock in the evening in Malaysia now. We're hearing that
*13:59.000- 14:02.580* :  quite a lot of people really clearly have just left it too late, haven't they? Yeah, there are
*14:02.580- 14:10.220* :  apparently in Bangladesh, Bangladesh's makeup, the majority of people migrant workers in Malaysia,
*14:10.220- 14:17.820* :  they're about 350,000, I think, last year, 30,000 migrant workers in Bangladesh who have their
*14:17.820- 14:23.320* :  papers in order to start working in Malaysia, haven't been able to get a flight to Kuala Lumpur
*14:23.560- 14:27.900* :  to actually get in. So they're probably going to be left behind and lots of other countries as well,
*14:27.900- 14:34.460* :  Nepal, Indonesia workers from there are not going to be able to get in as well. And it's really
*14:34.460- 14:41.020* :  reflection partly of the attraction and the law you have of Malaysia, one of the richest countries
*14:41.020- 14:46.740* :  countries in Southeast Asia, lots of people from poorer countries want to go there to work
*14:47.940- 14:51.540* :  and they're just not going to be able to go in there, at least for the short time while the
*14:51.540- 14:58.620* :  government assesses how many more it needs. Mickey Bristol, for more than two years, Ukraine has
*14:58.620- 15:05.580* :  been using weapons given to it by its supporters, but allies like the United States and the EU have
*15:05.580- 15:10.980* :  put restrictions on how those weapons can be used because they don't want to risk broadening the
*15:10.980- 15:17.700* :  conflict. Well now a key moment has arrived as Ukraine is being told it can now use US weapons to
*15:17.700- 15:23.660* :  attack Russian positions in Russia itself, but again with strict limitations. President Zelensky
*15:23.660- 15:28.420* :  has hailed the US decision as a step forward. Our correspondent in Kiev is Gene McKenzie.
*15:28.980- 15:34.980* :  This is something that the US has been mulling over President Biden deciding that Kiev is now
*15:34.980- 15:39.860* :  allowed to use the weapons that it provides to strike inter-Russian territories you've been saying,
*15:39.860- 15:46.040* :  but the restrictions are that it must be along this border of the Harkiv region, that borders
*15:46.040- 15:51.280* :  the Belgrade region in Russia because this is where Russia's latest offensive has been and it
*15:51.280- 15:55.960* :  is where the Ukrainians have been struggling to defend themselves. So just a couple of weeks ago
*15:55.960- 16:01.040* :  the Russian troops came over the border into the Harkiv region, they took villages and they are
*16:01.040- 16:07.620* :  continuing to attack this part of Northeastern Ukraine from Belgrade. So from Russia they are able
*16:07.620- 16:13.000* :  to launch missiles and artillery into the region and the Ukrainians have been saying that there is
*16:13.000- 16:18.320* :  nothing that we can do about this really until these missiles and these bombs enter Ukrainian
*16:18.320- 16:23.880* :  territory, we're not allowed to strike and that has really frustrated Zelensky who has basically
*16:23.880- 16:29.380* :  been arguing that his troops are having to fight with one arm behind them. But what the US is saying
*16:29.380- 16:35.040* :  is that they cannot use US weapons on any of the other fronts in this war, right? And they also
*16:35.040- 16:39.720* :  can't use the US long-range missiles that have been provided which would be able to strike
*16:39.720- 16:46.160* :  deep into the heart of Russian territory. Gene McKenzie, well NATO foreign ministers are continuing
*16:46.160- 16:51.560* :  their two-day meeting in the Czech capital Prague. So how have they been reacting to what's being
*16:51.560- 16:57.560* :  said in the US? Rob Cameron is in Prague. Well we were watching the arrivals of the foreign ministers
*16:57.560- 17:03.340* :  to Cherdinin Palace, the headquarters of the Czech foreign ministry this morning and I was taking
*17:03.340- 17:09.540* :  notes of the Swedish, the Latvian, the Estonian, the Dutch, the Polish and indeed the Czech
*17:09.960- 17:13.480* :  ministers as they came in and they also had looked this maybe something new and revolutionary
*17:13.480- 17:17.620* :  for Washington but we've been doing it all along. We've never had restrictions, never placed
*17:17.620- 17:23.640* :  restrictions that would stop Ukraine from using the weapons that we give Kiev even inside Russia
*17:23.980- 17:28.180* :  at the Czech foreign minister, brief journalist and he said, look if Russian planes are launching
*17:28.180- 17:35.780* :  rockets from Russian airspace and destroying Ukrainian cities, surely it makes sense to bring down
*17:35.780- 17:43.120* :  the planes rather than try and bring down the rockets as long as that can be done within the boundaries
*17:43.120- 17:48.280* :  of international law under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and with a sense of logic
*17:48.280- 17:55.220* :  if that is to be applied. So a very very united line from the foreign ministers with the exception
*17:55.260- 18:01.860* :  of a few states chief among them Italy, probably the biggest country in NATO that is against and of
*18:01.860- 18:07.360* :  course Hungary and Slovakia which have always opposed any NATO military aid or any individual
*18:07.360- 18:13.640* :  military aid to Ukraine. Robert, look so Germany has said it's giving permission to Ukraine to
*18:13.640- 18:19.220* :  fire its weapons on targets in Russia. Meanwhile the Kremlin has been saying that US weapons are already
*18:19.220- 18:27.620* :  being used to target Russia as it is. So look so Russia has sort of baked this into its expectations.
*18:28.440- 18:35.040* :  Yes and there has of course been some reaction from Russia, the most outspoken comments as we've come
*18:35.040- 18:42.260* :  to get used to is from the former president Dmitry Medvedev who said that this announcement or this
*18:42.260- 18:49.500* :  news from Washington show that weapons provided by NATO and NATO countries had been used against
*18:49.500- 18:54.800* :  Russia all along. He said that Moscow was not bluffing about the possible use of tactical
*18:54.800- 19:02.100* :  nuclear weapons and that any use of long range weapons inside Russia would mean war between
*19:02.100- 19:08.640* :  Russia and NATO. I think it should be said though that most policymakers, most officials at least in
*19:08.640- 19:14.000* :  the sort of public debate frankly regarding Mr Medvedev as a bit of a clown. He was always making these
*19:14.000- 19:20.600* :  incredibly inflammatory statements constantly threatening the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation
*19:20.600- 19:25.820* :  and he's done that from the outset ever since Russia invaded Ukraine. So I think that most
*19:25.820- 19:31.640* :  western policymakers will not be taking those threats too seriously. Rob Cameron in Prague.

*21:07.280- 21:12.540* :  South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, is on course to lose its majority
*21:12.540- 21:17.960* :  in parliament for the first time since it came to power 30 years ago. Turn out for the general
*21:17.960- 21:23.580* :  election was high with a last minute surge, but the votes have now been counted and the results
*21:23.580- 21:29.280* :  are being audited. Barbara Pledarsha is our correspondent in Johannesburg. I asked her if the situation
*21:29.280- 21:35.160* :  on the ground looks like bad news for the ANC. It does. Yes, although the ANC is not admitting
*21:35.160- 21:39.160* :  that, they're still vowing that they will get a majority, but I'm looking at the results
*21:39.160- 21:43.820* :  dashboard right now in real, where you get the results in real time. And that is not what it's
*21:43.820- 21:51.640* :  looking like. It's 56.34% audited the vote. And at this stage, the ANC has around 42% of the vote.
*21:52.200- 21:56.680* :  The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which is a right of center pro-business party,
*21:56.680- 22:03.580* :  has about 23, 24%. Then this is interesting. The MK party, which was formed in December by the
*22:03.580- 22:09.860* :  former president, Jacob Zuma, basically as a challenge to the ANC, has 11%. So it's the third
*22:09.860- 22:16.640* :  highest number of votes so far. And then the economic freedom fighters, another group led by a
*22:16.640- 22:22.940* :  former ANC figure has about 9.5%. And these last to the MK and the EFF, quite radical left-wing
*22:23.000- 22:28.840* :  policies in terms of the economics of the country. Both of them advocate an expropriating land
*22:28.840- 22:34.160* :  without compensation for the use of the people as they put it. So you have quite an interesting
*22:34.160- 22:41.240* :  breakdown of percentages and different ideologies. So it does look, perhaps, the ANC is not admitting
*22:41.240- 22:46.440* :  this, but it looks as though a coalition might have to be formed. What are the options for the ANC?
*22:47.340- 22:54.000* :  Well, one of the options could be for the ANC to form a coalition with smaller parties,
*22:54.000- 22:59.640* :  with a number of smaller parties who would demand less compensations. I think that's looking less
*22:59.640- 23:06.340* :  and less likely as it becomes clearer that the ANC probably is not going to get above 45%,
*23:06.340- 23:10.800* :  but I don't think that's been ruled out. The other option then would be that they would have to
*23:10.800- 23:15.380* :  form an alliance with one of those three that I mentioned, either on the right, the Democratic
*23:15.380- 23:20.480* :  Alliance, but they're quite different ideologically from the ANC, or on the left with either the MK
*23:21.360- 23:25.920* :  or the economic freedom fighters, or both. And again, that would be more of a natural fit because both
*23:25.920- 23:31.240* :  of those parties have connections previously to the ANC, but as I said, they have quite radical
*23:31.240- 23:36.960* :  policies that would make complicated for the ANC. So, you know, it's quite unpredictable. We really
*23:36.960- 23:45.220* :  don't know what sort of coalition could be formed. So why have some South Africans fallen out of
*23:45.220- 23:51.260* :  love with the ANC? Here's our correspondent in Durban, Noms Massacre. People are quite dissolutioned
*23:51.260- 23:58.760* :  by promises made, but not kept by the governing African National Congress. In fact, just a few minutes
*23:58.760- 24:06.000* :  ago, I just came back from the community of Verilum, which is a 20-minute drive from the Durban
*24:06.000- 24:14.180* :  City Centre, and that community has not had running water for 10 months, and they are saying that
*24:14.180- 24:21.440* :  they've been waiting, you know, for the ANC, because that's the Councillor of that community,
*24:21.440- 24:27.840* :  to fix the water problem. But because that has not happened, they then decided to vote against
*24:27.840- 24:34.400* :  the ANC in the selection, because they felt that the ANC was not taking them serious in terms of
*24:34.400- 24:40.620* :  making sure that services are delivered to the people. Noms Massacre in Durban.
*24:41.540- 24:46.900* :  Mexicans head to the polls on Sunday in a historic election. Both the front runner,
*24:46.900- 24:54.400* :  they form a mayor of Mexico City, Claudia Shainbaum, and the main challenger are women, meaning
*24:54.400- 24:59.840* :  Mexico is almost certain to choose its first female president. But what impact will that have in a
*24:59.840- 25:05.420* :  nation with deeply embedded problems of machismo and sexual violence against women and girls?
*25:06.000- 25:10.500* :  Our Mexico correspondent Will Grant reports from the campaign trail in the eastern state of
*25:10.500- 25:11.100* :  Veracluse.
*25:15.340- 25:20.240* :  As Claudia Shainbaum arrives through a rally in a packed park in the colonial city of Orisaba,
*25:20.860- 25:26.660* :  the crowd chance, Presidenta, Presidenta. Poll suggests that's what she's on the brink of becoming.
*25:26.660- 25:31.760* :  Mexico's first ever woman president. With her closest rival also a woman,
*25:31.760- 25:36.440* :  Mexico is set to break centuries of male domination of the country's highest office.
*25:36.980- 25:41.900* :  It's a symbol for Mexico. I think it's a symbol for the world, but it's a symbol for Mexico.
*25:42.160- 25:47.480* :  In an exclusive interview, Shainbaum told the BBC it's a sign that Mexican society is finally
*25:47.480- 25:56.100* :  evolving. Mexicans are now governed by many women. I see it in young girls. They are exciting
*25:57.120- 26:02.200* :  that a woman is going to be president and it changed culture for women and for men.
*26:02.540- 26:05.660* :  And you have to develop policies to reduce violence for women.
*26:06.160- 26:10.120* :  Vamos con información. En Veracluse hayan a joven simbida.
*26:10.400- 26:14.180* :  That is easier said than done in a country where 11 women are murdered a day.
*26:17.340- 26:22.140* :  Just days before the candidates visit the Veracluse, the body of 23-year-old
*26:22.140- 26:26.800* :  is Samarga Lindo was found tortured, wrapped in a blanket and dumped in a canal.
*26:32.160- 26:35.640* :  I put it to Claudia Shainbaum that the question of whether a man or a woman is
*26:35.640- 26:40.920* :  in charge will matter little if such ingrained problems of machismo in Mexico remain the same.
*26:41.160- 26:47.180* :  She replied that profound cultural changes don't happen overnight and if elected, she said she'll
*26:47.180- 26:52.620* :  continue the process of social and political change begun by her mentor. President Andres
*26:52.620- 26:58.660* :  Manuel López Obrador, who's more commonly known by his initials as Amlo. Their supporters call
*26:58.660- 27:05.340* :  the political project the fourth transformation of Mexico. The objective of the government is changing
*27:05.340- 27:11.460* :  the model, the economic model, and it's changing also for women. I'm going to tell you something
*27:11.460- 27:20.180* :  that indigenous women told me in Los Altos de Chiapas. I will try to translate it. You are the
*27:20.180- 27:27.000* :  not accomplished dream of our grandmothers. Do you feel quite a lot of responsibility on your
*27:27.000- 27:30.660* :  shoulders when women tell you those sorts of things in Mexico and remote Mexico? I feel
*27:30.660- 27:34.140* :  responsibility because I'm going to be the next president of Mexico, of course.
*27:37.120- 27:40.300* :  The BBC requested an interview with Ms. Shainbaum's main rival,
*27:40.300- 27:46.800* :  Sochital Galvez, but she declined. Ms. Galvez's key criticism of the so-called fourth transformation
*27:46.860- 27:52.080* :  is that President López Obrador's social spending is unaffordable and that his entire political
*27:52.080- 27:58.300* :  project is a personality cult. As for Ms. Shainbaum, she accuses her of being merely Amlo's puppet,
*27:58.380- 28:04.140* :  something the former environmental scientist firmly denies. Of course I'm of the same movement
*28:04.140- 28:10.560* :  with López Obrador. We've fought together for more than 20 years. I'm going to govern with the
*28:10.560- 28:18.860* :  same principles and that's a good thing. The other main challenge at Claudio Shainbaum's events
*28:18.860- 28:25.160* :  is Primera, meaning the first, but a woman president in Mexico is hugely significant and long
*28:25.160- 28:31.800* :  over due. Still the biggest challenge for the winner lies ahead. In undoing centuries of sex's
*28:31.800- 28:36.660* :  own gender inequality and violence in one of the most patriarchal societies in the Americans.
*28:37.860- 28:45.220* :  World Grouch reporting from Mexico. Our history was made in Canada this week when an Indigenous
*28:45.220- 28:49.620* :  lawmaker addressed a provincial parliament in his own language for the first time.
*28:50.220- 28:56.840* :  Sol Mamacwa, a new democratic party member for the community of Kingfisher Lake First Nation,
*28:57.220- 29:01.320* :  has been speaking to the BBC about the experience. Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*29:05.020- 29:17.840* :  A major milestone for Indigenous Canadians. Sol Mamacwa making a formal address in his own
*29:17.920- 29:23.960* :  language, saying he was speaking for those who couldn't. It's the first time the language other
*29:23.960- 29:29.540* :  than English and French has ever been permitted in the chamber. His family were there to support him
*29:29.540- 29:35.860* :  with some flying hours to get there, but he was still uncertain at first. I got this weird feeling
*29:35.860- 29:41.800* :  at the beginning, probably about 30 seconds and, you know, what am I doing and am I going to get
*29:42.300- 29:47.860* :  stopped? And about a minute into it, I got comfortable. But also the First Nations people,
*29:47.860- 29:52.880* :  the leadership, the elders, my family that were there, they were so moved.
*29:53.200- 29:57.180* :  In the past, lawmakers have been stopped when speaking their own language during formal
*29:57.180- 30:03.520* :  proceedings for them a familiar experience. When I was in grade 9, 13 years old, we were
*30:03.520- 30:09.940* :  punished for speaking our language and we were given very hard labor. Then there's so other
*30:09.940- 30:15.880* :  stories that you're given to me by other survivors and that said, you know, they were soap was used
*30:15.880- 30:20.880* :  to clean out their mouths because they were speaking their language. There are more than 70 distinct
*30:20.880- 30:25.880* :  Indigenous languages in Canada and the United Nations has said all of them are at risk.
*30:26.240- 30:32.180* :  Sol Mamacwa says he's committed to fighting for the identity of all Indigenous people with a
*30:32.180- 30:37.580* :  special message for Indigenous children. I think it's important to be proud of who they are,
*30:37.660- 30:43.120* :  to be proud of the language that they speak because languages are part of the healing that we
*30:43.120- 30:48.860* :  need to do and today language is what's reconciliation. That report was by Stephanie Prentice.
*30:50.160- 30:55.160* :  The New York Times, which owns the hit game Wordal, has filed a legal challenge against attempts
*30:55.160- 31:01.000* :  to register a game with a very similar name created as a hobby by a man in Seattle.
*31:01.600- 31:07.520* :  Players of world law, hard to say, have to identify the precise location of a photo taken
*31:07.520- 31:14.080* :  from Google's Street View. But the paper says the name causes confusion. Our technology editor,
*31:14.080- 31:20.340* :  so he climb and takes up the story. Wordal became popular in 2022 and the New York Times acquired
*31:20.340- 31:25.280* :  the word game for a seven-figure sum. One of its millions of players was Corey McDonald,
*31:25.280- 31:32.300* :  a software developer in Seattle who was inspired to set up Worldal in his spare time. Mr. McDonald says
*31:32.300- 31:36.640* :  that while the name is no coincidence, there are many other similar sounding games out there,
*31:36.640- 31:41.900* :  such as Hurdle, Nurtle and Quardle. But the New York Times is opposing his attempt to register
*31:41.900- 31:47.100* :  Worldal. He says he'll fight the legal opposition and hopes it could set a precedent for others in
*31:47.100- 31:52.580* :  future. But one expert said because Mr. McDonald's game name was different by just one letter,
*31:52.960- 31:57.680* :  he could be sailing close to the wind. The New York Times declined to say whether it was pursuing
*31:57.680- 32:04.660* :  any other titles. Zoe Kleinman. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new
