*01:26.060- 01:33.300* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh, and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, May 21st,
*01:33.420- 01:34.660* :  these are our main stories.
*01:35.500- 01:39.720* :  Greece drops charges against nine men accused over a migrant boat disaster,
*01:40.300- 01:44.060* :  while the E-U is accused of funding operations by North African governments
*01:44.140- 01:45.880* :  to dump migrants in the desert.

*02:02.300- 02:06.920* :  Open AI earns the wrath of a Hollywood a-lister and...
*02:10.060- 02:13.320* :  All the tourists cross the streets, and they don't seem to care about the cars at all,
*02:13.680- 02:16.760* :  it's dangerous, and they leave litter and cigarette butts everywhere.
*02:17.460- 02:21.540* :  Why the quest for the perfect insta is causing irritation in Japan.
*02:27.400- 02:31.660* :  We start with two stories concerning the treatment of migrants from Africa to Europe.
*02:32.280- 02:36.020* :  Every year thousands of people leave their homes across the African continent
*02:36.040- 02:39.040* :  in an effort to make their way across the Mediterranean.
*02:39.460- 02:45.340* :  Last June, an overcrowded fishing boat that had set off from Libya sank off the coast of Greece.
*02:45.920- 02:47.120* :  600 people died.
*02:47.900- 02:49.480* :  Mohammed's cousin was one of them.
*02:50.480- 02:52.200* :  He wanted to be a doctorate, I like me.
*02:57.060- 02:58.700* :  And even now his friends were telling me,
*02:59.400- 03:01.780* :  you're the doctor who was telling us about.
*03:03.440- 03:04.100* :  You have a choice.
*03:04.520- 03:07.960* :  That's why I told you either die slowly in Syria,
*03:08.780- 03:11.600* :  or go and try to look and die fast if you're lucky.
*03:13.460- 03:17.940* :  Even before the trial began, there had been question marks over whether it would be fair.
*03:17.940- 03:24.140* :  The BBC had been told by some survivors they'd been ordered by the Greek coup scot to frame the men.
*03:24.920- 03:28.560* :  I spoke to our correspondent Nick Beak outside the court in Kalamata.
*03:29.140- 03:31.780* :  Pretty dramatic scenes, actually, at the courthouse.
*03:31.780- 03:37.140* :  And there were lots of protesters outside here, and they cheered when the news filtered through
*03:37.140- 03:39.940* :  that these three judges had thrown out this case.
*03:39.940- 03:45.420* :  The reason for that is that they had been looking at an application by the defence,
*03:45.420- 03:50.440* :  who were arguing that because this boat sank in international waters,
*03:50.440- 03:54.280* :  there was no legal basis for this trial to be held in Greece.
*03:54.280- 03:57.780* :  And what's happened is that the judges have agreed with that.
*03:57.840- 04:00.360* :  So you've got a position where, for the last 11 months,
*04:00.360- 04:04.660* :  these nine Egyptian men have been held in custody in Greece.
*04:04.660- 04:06.320* :  They've been protesting their innocence.
*04:06.320- 04:11.260* :  As you say, six survivors told us previously that they believed these men were innocent,
*04:11.260- 04:16.360* :  that they were framed and that the Greek coast guard had urged other survivors to give evidence
*04:16.400- 04:19.620* :  against them, something the Greek coast guard has consistently denied.
*04:19.620- 04:23.580* :  So there was all this controversy around the case, and now it's been dismissed,
*04:23.580- 04:27.960* :  and the men ultimately, whether it's the day or tomorrow, it seems they'll be freed.
*04:28.780- 04:31.340* :  And the BBC's been following this case, hasn't it, very closely?
*04:32.320- 04:36.560* :  Yeah, this right, we arrived here in Kalamata on the 14th of June last year.
*04:36.560- 04:40.060* :  That was the day that the boat sank, and immediately there were big question marks
*04:40.560- 04:41.980* :  about what had actually gone on.
*04:42.100- 04:47.420* :  The Greek coast guard had said that this boat was traveling at a steady speed towards Italy,
*04:47.420- 04:50.740* :  and it was safe, and there was no need to rescue it.
*04:51.100- 04:54.400* :  But survivors started to say very quickly that that simply wasn't true,
*04:54.400- 04:58.980* :  that for hours they watched what was happening, and then ultimately the Greek coast guard
*04:58.980- 05:04.460* :  survivors alleged, launched this sort of last-minute botched effort to tow the boat,
*05:04.480- 05:10.280* :  causing it to capsize, and we know up to 600 people have died in this situation,
*05:10.280- 05:12.420* :  so that accusations right from the start.
*05:12.840- 05:15.720* :  And you know, in the here and now, these nine Egyptian men,
*05:16.120- 05:17.840* :  certainly they've been found not guilty.
*05:17.840- 05:21.360* :  There's no case to answer, but I think there are some quite troubling questions
*05:22.100- 05:25.340* :  that remain around the role of the Greek coast guard.
*05:25.640- 05:29.140* :  We know a Greek naval course is examining this at the moment behind the scenes,
*05:29.500- 05:31.940* :  but certainly a lot of human rights groups are quite worried that
*05:32.400- 05:35.960* :  we'll never really get to the bottom of what happened here.
*05:36.260- 05:38.820* :  Well, yes, as you say, radically different accounts.
*05:38.940- 05:41.100* :  Do you think there could be recriminations?
*05:42.200- 05:45.200* :  Well, certainly the Greek government has been backing the coast guard,
*05:45.660- 05:50.000* :  the Greek Prime Minister last year, when asked about the allegations that we've found.
*05:50.000- 05:55.240* :  He said that smugglers really are in people's focus here.
*05:55.240- 05:58.160* :  They should be the people who are culpable for what happens.
*05:58.160- 06:02.520* :  They make great amounts of money from this trade in human misery
*06:02.520- 06:07.180* :  and said that people should be supporting and thanking the Greek coast guard for what they do.
*06:07.360- 06:11.540* :  So it's a case, I think, which has got a lot of attention in Greece,
*06:11.540- 06:13.220* :  but internationally too.
*06:13.660- 06:16.160* :  And in terms of whether there's any lasting legacy of this,
*06:16.560- 06:17.760* :  it's not clear at this point.
*06:18.440- 06:19.100* :  Nick Beak.
*06:20.040- 06:23.300* :  On the same sorry theme, the risks people are willing to take,
*06:23.300- 06:27.220* :  and the price money pay for the dream of a better life in Europe.
*06:27.680- 06:31.400* :  A group of leading international media outlets, including the Washington Post,
*06:31.400- 06:37.080* :  Le Monde and L. Pais have accused North African governments of dumping migrants in the desert
*06:37.560- 06:40.340* :  with the assistance of funding from the European Union.
*06:40.340- 06:45.640* :  The newsrooms Richard Hamilton has been following the story and told me more about the allegations.
*06:46.580- 06:52.860* :  They've recorded harrowing testimony from sub-Saharan migrants who said they were intercepted
*06:52.860- 06:59.080* :  in the Mediterranean by the coast guards, taken then overland by pickup trucks or buses
*06:59.640- 07:04.780* :  around 600 kilometres, then dumped in border areas in the Sahara desert
*07:05.280- 07:10.660* :  and told to walk across the border into Algeria, Niger, other countries,
*07:11.240- 07:14.760* :  where they are dying from heat stroke dehydration.
*07:15.300- 07:21.020* :  And they say it's a clandestine operation, but it has a silent partner which is the European Union.
*07:21.020- 07:29.600* :  Between 2015 and 2021, the EU sent $400 million to Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania
*07:30.120- 07:34.980* :  for a migration fund which was to foster economic growth and stem migration.
*07:35.640- 07:40.380* :  Now they funded projects which are sometimes difficult to track as a lack of transparency,
*07:41.400- 07:46.120* :  and the EU funds they say have been used for buying equipment like pickup trucks,
*07:46.140- 07:52.260* :  as well as training security services, and there are allegations that Spanish security forces
*07:52.740- 07:58.040* :  reviewed lists of migrants photographed them before they were put on these trucks and deported.
*07:58.840- 08:00.800* :  So why are they doing all this to these migrants?
*08:01.460- 08:07.560* :  Well, as we know, the issue of migration is a massive problem and that's why the far right in
*08:07.560- 08:13.400* :  Europe seems to be on the rise. And last year, for example, the European Union recorded
*08:13.400- 08:19.980* :  380,000 or so irregular border arrivals. That figure keeps increasing,
*08:19.980- 08:25.500* :  and the North African countries feel that they're really doing Europe's dirty work.
*08:25.500- 08:29.660* :  So a French academic quoted in the Washington Post says,
*08:30.020- 08:34.420* :  the fact is the European states do not want to be the ones to have dirty hands.
*08:34.420- 08:39.140* :  They do not want to be considered responsible for the violation of human rights.
*08:39.700- 08:45.600* :  So they are subcontracting these violations to third party states, but really they're responsible.
*08:46.440- 08:51.660* :  And then one contractor said, basically, we want to make life difficult for the migrants,
*08:51.660- 08:56.660* :  so that if we keep dumping them in the desert, the third time they'll give up and go home.
*08:57.440- 09:00.240* :  Is there any response from the North African countries or the EU?
*09:00.720- 09:06.580* :  Yes, as you might expect, they've been denied. So the interior ministry in Morocco has denied
*09:06.580- 09:13.020* :  allegations of racial profiling, saying they're baseless. They say migrants are only relocated
*09:13.020- 09:19.240* :  to protect them from trafficking networks. They said that the European support for them was minimal
*09:19.240- 09:24.700* :  and that they had to pay most of the cost of deporting people. Similarly, Tunisia,
*09:24.700- 09:31.080* :  its foreign ministry has insisted it upholds migrants rights and only expels them voluntarily.
*09:31.080- 09:36.480* :  Similar statements from Mauritania and their European Union has denied sponsoring the
*09:36.480- 09:40.480* :  mistreatment or deportation of migrants. Richard Hamilton.
*09:42.020- 09:46.980* :  Medical workers in Israel have told the BBC that Palestinian detainees from Gaza
*09:46.980- 09:53.520* :  are routinely kept shackled to hospital beds, blindfolded, sometimes naked and forced to wear
*09:53.520- 10:00.180* :  nappies. A practice one doctor said amounted to torture. In response, the Israeli army said detainees
*10:00.180- 10:05.520* :  were only handcuffed when security demanded it and that nappies were only used for those who
*10:05.520- 10:10.880* :  had undergone medical procedures. The BBC's Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson reports.
*10:13.940- 10:20.820* :  Sovian Abu Saleh returned to Gaza an injured man. A taxi driver from Khan Yunis newly released
*10:20.820- 10:26.720* :  from Israeli military detention, he limped down the hallway of a Gaza hospital. The knotted
*10:26.720- 10:31.660* :  trouser leg of his grey prison tracksuit, dangling where his left leg should be.
*10:34.800- 10:41.800* :  My leg got infected and turned blue and soft as a sponge. After seven days, they took me to the
*10:41.800- 10:48.300* :  military hospital, dragging and beating me on the way there. Hitting my injured leg,
*10:48.840- 10:55.040* :  they operated twice to clean the wound, but it didn't work. After words, they took me to a
*10:55.040- 11:04.340* :  public hospital where the doctor gave me two options, my leg or my life. How am I supposed to feel
*11:04.340- 11:11.920* :  after having two legs for my whole life and then losing one every now and then I cry.
*11:14.160- 11:20.960* :  Around him, his children wet silently as Sovian showed the BBC the stitches sewn across his knee.
*11:21.800- 11:27.540* :  The return of their father, soured by sadness. Neither Israel's army nor health ministry
*11:27.540- 11:32.900* :  responded to these specific allegations about Sovian's treatment, but there's growing concern
*11:32.900- 11:36.320* :  over the medical care of Gaza and detainees in Israel.
*11:42.200- 11:47.360* :  Footage from Israeli television shows detainees from Gaza held in military prisons.
*11:48.280- 11:54.800* :  Classed as unlawful combatants, even before interrogation, doctors say they are kept shackled
*11:54.800- 12:01.280* :  and blindfolded, including during hospital treatment. Allegations have centered on a new field
*12:01.280- 12:07.400* :  hospital at the state-em-aan military base. I think it's most important that physicians like me
*12:07.400- 12:13.160* :  as we treat people. I could not care less what the prisoner is doing there or not.
*12:13.580- 12:17.680* :  Joel Donchin, a senior medic and anesthesiologist at the hospital,
*12:18.300- 12:24.080* :  says patients are kept blindfolded and in nappies, with all four limbs handcuffed to the bed.
*12:24.820- 12:31.240* :  The army, they create the patient to be dependent 100 percent on you like a baby.
*12:32.220- 12:36.580* :  You are cuffed, you are with diaper, you need the water, you need everything.
*12:37.820- 12:42.880* :  It's the humanization of them. The army told us that the need to handcuff detainees
*12:42.880- 12:48.840* :  in the medical facility was examined individually and daily, and that cuffing was done only when
*12:48.840- 12:54.780* :  the security risk required it. Dipers or nappies, it said, were only for those patients with
*12:54.780- 13:01.240* :  limited movement. But Dr Donchin told us that these measures were applied to all patients without
*13:01.240- 13:07.140* :  assessment, even those who couldn't walk. If they can't stand on their legs, why are they shackled?
*13:08.020- 13:10.840* :  I can't answer this. This is stupid.
*13:12.020- 13:17.080* :  Treating guards and captives on military sites was meant to resolve Dr's ethical dilemmas,
*13:17.780- 13:21.580* :  but those dilemmas remain. The moment our hospital at state,
*13:21.580- 13:26.740* :  a man closes Dr Donchin told me, we'll celebrate Lucy Williamson.
*13:28.260- 13:32.860* :  The British government has set out its plans to compensate those affected by a scandal
*13:32.860- 13:38.800* :  that saw doctors, the National Health Service and successive governments try to cover up the
*13:38.800- 13:45.260* :  fact that tens of thousands of people contracted hepatitis C and HIV after they were given contaminated
*13:45.260- 13:50.340* :  blood or blood products. John Glenn from the governing conservatives told the House of Commons
*13:50.340- 13:57.500* :  about the scheme. Those who have been infected or affected as a result of this scandal will receive
*13:57.500- 14:07.940* :  compensation. To be crystal clear, if you have been directly or indirectly infected by NHS
*14:07.940- 14:16.460* :  blood, blood products or tissue contaminated with HIV or hepatitis C or have developed a
*14:16.460- 14:23.900* :  chronic infection from blood contaminated with hepatitis B, you will be eligible to claim
*14:23.900- 14:30.060* :  compensation under the scheme. I heard more from our UK affairs correspondent Rob Wopson.
*14:30.600- 14:37.600* :  It's 30,000 people over 20-year period, where people were given blood products which led to
*14:37.600- 14:42.920* :  severe health problems and some case death, in the case of 3,000, but perhaps most grievously to
*14:42.920- 14:49.400* :  just compound it all that for decades the government covered up, health service covered up,
*14:49.400- 14:54.080* :  doctors covered up, what they knew and the risks that had been known all along.
*14:54.540- 14:57.960* :  Will this compensation package satisfy the campaigners, do you think?
*14:58.440- 15:02.480* :  Given what they've been through for the last 20 years, I think they're bound to be rather
*15:02.480- 15:06.800* :  skeptical, but they were pleased with the report. They feel as though the truth has finally
*15:07.440- 15:12.300* :  come out. I guess they're going to be pleased that the scheme certainly, in the way it's been
*15:12.300- 15:18.420* :  defined in the last hour or so, seems to be rather wide ranging and could well end up paying
*15:18.420- 15:25.860* :  out over 12 billion dollars. I guess the key thing to step back from this is that the whole way
*15:25.860- 15:32.560* :  in which this is unfolded is shaken the faith in the system by what I mean, the government,
*15:32.560- 15:39.240* :  politicians, civil service, health service doctors, shaken the faith that people have in the system
*15:39.240- 15:43.860* :  in Britain that it's somehow there for ordinary people. This, of course, is not the first
*15:43.860- 15:48.720* :  scandal Bernadette that's come on on the top of others like the post office. So a really
*15:48.720- 15:54.060* :  sort of profound moment for a flexion for the British state. Yes, as you say, it follows the
*15:54.060- 15:58.320* :  post office scandal, which has been described as one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice.
*15:59.100- 16:04.100* :  Is it perhaps a sort of sign that Britain's somehow broken, Rob? Well, I mean, it will certainly
*16:04.100- 16:07.840* :  feed into that. I mean, what you have a lot in Britain at the moment, opinion polling that
*16:07.840- 16:12.400* :  anecdotal evidence suggests that somehow people think the state, it's just not working whether
*16:12.400- 16:16.620* :  it's transportation, whether it's health, whether it's government, wherever people look,
*16:16.940- 16:22.660* :  they just feel that something about Britain is broken and certainly this will contribute to that,
*16:22.660- 16:27.340* :  particularly if you contrast it internationally where this problem with infected blood happened,
*16:27.340- 16:32.020* :  you know, lots and lots of countries, but Britain has taken longer than any other to sort of get
*16:32.020- 16:40.680* :  round to dealing with it. Rob Watson, the new AI-powered chatbot, chat GBT4, has removed one of
*16:40.680- 16:46.100* :  its voice options after users found it brought an uncanny resemblance to the American actress,
*16:46.100- 16:52.780* :  Scarlett Johansson, open AI, denied that it wasn't any way connected with the role she played in
*16:52.780- 16:59.860* :  the 2013 film, her. Here's a snippet of what the new chatbot sounded like. Hey, chat GBT, I'm Mark.
*16:59.860- 17:07.220* :  How are you? Oh, Mark. I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. How about you? I'm on stage right now.
*17:07.220- 17:10.080* :  I'm doing a live demo and frankly, I'm feeling a little bit nervous.
*17:11.240- 17:16.460* :  Oh, you're doing a live demo right now? That's awesome. Just take a deep breath.
*17:17.400- 17:22.280* :  Our technology correspondent Zoe Kleinman told us more about what the actress has been saying.
*17:22.780- 17:28.660* :  Scarlett Johansson says she's shocked and angered to hear that the voice you just heard of a new
*17:28.660- 17:34.820* :  tool called GBT4O sounds so much like her. She says she'd been approached by Sammel when he's
*17:34.820- 17:40.360* :  the boss of open AI and asked if she would be the voice and she turned it down and then she says
*17:40.360- 17:45.900* :  two days before they launched it, they contacted her agent again and turned it down again.
*17:46.280- 17:52.520* :  Now, when the tool was first unveiled, Sammel then tweeted one word which was the word her. Now,
*17:52.520- 17:58.360* :  you may be familiar with a film from 2013 called her in which Scarlett Johansson plays an AI
*17:58.360- 18:04.260* :  assistant that the male lead Hwackin Phoenix falls in love with. So he clearly did see that there was
*18:04.260- 18:09.380* :  some sort of coincidental connection there. This is such a good example, isn't it, of exactly what
*18:09.380- 18:15.360* :  so many creatives are worried about, you know, the idea of AI mimicking your art, your work,
*18:15.360- 18:21.120* :  your livelihood, and then perhaps ultimately replacing you. Now, we've got an AI safety summit
*18:21.120- 18:25.880* :  in South Korea and this is going to be one of the subjects that's discussed there, but it is
*18:25.880- 18:31.500* :  really worrying to people who say not only does AI mimic it well, but it's also arguably
*18:31.500- 18:36.220* :  cheaper to use than the real deal, isn't it? We'll be interesting to see what comes out of it,
*18:36.220- 18:39.940* :  but definitely there's been a change in mood when I went there in November. It was all about,
*18:39.940- 18:44.980* :  you know, the big doomsday existential threats that might be posed from AI. And that seems to
*18:44.980- 18:48.980* :  have changed track down become, you know, let's talk about job losses, let's talk about bias,
*18:49.020- 18:53.360* :  let's talk about these issues that are really more likely to hit people's lives sooner. I think
*18:53.360- 19:01.800* :  then the sort of doomsday terminator scenario. Zoe Kleinman. Still to come, a passenger dies as a
*19:01.800- 19:06.040* :  long haul flight hits severe turbulence on its way from London to Singapore.
*19:14.420- 19:18.920* :  This time yesterday we were reporting confirmation of the death of the Iranian President
*19:18.920- 19:24.320* :  Ibrahim Raesi in a helicopter crash on Sunday. Today the funeral ceremonies have begun.
*19:38.020- 19:43.620* :  Thousands of people in the city of Tabriz swarmed the truck carrying the coffins of Mr. Raesi
*19:43.620- 19:49.520* :  and others who died in the accident. Some waved Iranian flags, others held portraits of the
*19:49.520- 19:56.060* :  late leader. I asked the BBC Persians special correspondent Kazir Anaji to talk me through what
*19:56.060- 20:02.860* :  was happening as Iran begins five days of mourning. It started today with this informal funeral
*20:02.860- 20:09.680* :  in Tabriz. Of course, Tabriz is the capital of East Azerbaijan in northwest Iran, about 100
*20:09.680- 20:17.760* :  kilometres south of where the helicopter came down. What we saw today, a truck drove among the
*20:17.920- 20:24.240* :  crowd with the coffins of the president and the foreign minister and others, six others who were
*20:24.240- 20:31.580* :  killed. We are expecting a four more funeral tomorrow in Tehran, presided over by Iran's supreme
*20:31.580- 20:41.100* :  leader, five days of mourning tomorrow, a national holiday, and Iranian regime is very keen
*20:41.100- 20:48.500* :  to project stability, continuity, and support. They want many people to come out to these
*20:48.720- 20:54.980* :  ceremonies to show that people have rallied around the government and the regime. Of course,
*20:54.980- 21:01.640* :  you see in Tabriz, for example, about 10,000 people, probably more. These are the people who are
*21:01.640- 21:07.160* :  supporters of the hardliners in Iran. There are many people who are not. We're talking about
*21:07.160- 21:12.160* :  probably 10 to 15 percent of the population who support the hardliners and the government.
*21:12.660- 21:18.800* :  So the rest of the population do not appear in these crowds and they are on the side for the
*21:18.800- 21:25.180* :  moment. And from what we see reports and social media, there is quite a different sort of
*21:25.180- 21:31.120* :  emotion amongst those people. And condolences have come in from all over the world. What can we
*21:31.120- 21:36.920* :  read into those as Iran prepares for a forthcoming election? I think from the Iranian point of view,
*21:36.920- 21:44.800* :  they are encouraging in a sense that Iran is pretty isolated. And if you see various people,
*21:44.800- 21:52.620* :  various organizations, the UN, the EU, heads of states, expressing condolences, it's hard
*21:52.620- 21:59.440* :  warming for them in a sense that they think that they may not be as isolated as they thought
*21:59.440- 22:05.820* :  or as they are. But nevertheless, I don't think anything is going to change. This regime is
*22:05.820- 22:12.540* :  going to go on. There will be no changes in policy. And we are waiting for the next election,
*22:12.660- 22:15.320* :  which is going to be held on the 28th of June.
*22:15.900- 22:21.580* :  Kastra Najee, Shiva Marbobi is one person who's definitely not joining the public
*22:21.580- 22:27.780* :  morning for Mr. Riyasi. As a former child prisoner herself, she has first hand experience of the
*22:27.780- 22:33.940* :  impact of his policies. And his now spokeswoman for the campaign to free political prisoners in Iran.
*22:34.700- 22:42.100* :  She's been talking to Sana Safi. He issued, basically, a rest warrant, kidnapping millions of
*22:42.100- 22:49.540* :  people, including 13 years old, 12 years old, because I was myself in prison once when I was 12.
*22:49.540- 22:57.240* :  And once I was 16 years old, many of my prison mates were actually executed in the summer of 1988.
*22:58.280- 23:04.700* :  36 years ago, in the summer of 1988, he ordered, he was the member of a death committee.
*23:05.260- 23:11.260* :  He ordered the execution of more than 5,000 political prisoners only in three weeks.
*23:11.940- 23:17.960* :  So he is called a butcher of Tehran for the right reason. And also in the woman life,
*23:17.960- 23:25.480* :  freedom movement and protest, he was in charge and he was emphasizing in reinforcing the morality
*23:25.480- 23:33.720* :  police to kill women to suppress them. So as you can see, consistency, Riyasi, been suppressing,
*23:33.720- 23:40.380* :  been impacted, the life of people, millions of people, those families who lost their kids
*23:40.840- 23:48.300* :  in the 1988 massacre. They are still after 36 years looking for the grave of their loved one.
*23:48.620- 23:54.060* :  And they've still threatened up to this date. I'm really sad that this is not shown on TV and on
*23:54.060- 24:01.140* :  the news that people were having fireworks. Yes, last night, because they were happy that this murderer
*24:02.000- 24:07.740* :  has died. You mentioned that you went to jail twice. Can you tell us why you were jailed?
*24:08.140- 24:14.720* :  The first time when I was 12, we were demonstrating for reopening our school. And the second time,
*24:14.980- 24:20.840* :  I was in demonstration as when I was 16 years old. I think it's important to, when you hear the name
*24:20.840- 24:27.440* :  of Riyasi, that is like you hear the name of Hitler for us. And it's really interesting that yesterday,
*24:27.440- 24:34.760* :  we heard that international criminal court prosecutors seeking arrest for Netanyahu and Hamas leader,
*24:35.280- 24:42.280* :  Islamic regime, someone like Riyasi, actually created his beloved funding Hamas. But unfortunately,
*24:42.280- 24:49.440* :  Riyasi, to the end of his life, he was invited, he was accepted. How can a murderer who committed
*24:49.440- 24:55.600* :  crime against humanity for more than 40 years can be welcomed in the UN and other countries.
*24:56.040- 25:00.880* :  And that's what people want. They want whoever replace Riyasi, it really doesn't matter.
*25:00.880- 25:07.440* :  Regime in Iran is a system and they're all united in suppressing people, especially suppressing
*25:07.440- 25:16.340* :  LGBTQ women and whoever are defying them, basically. Sheva Mabobi, she was talking to Sana Safi.
*25:17.320- 25:23.020* :  A 73-year-old British man has been killed and several other people injured on a Singapore
*25:23.020- 25:28.860* :  Airlines flight from London that was hit by severe turbulence. The Singapore ban plane was
*25:28.860- 25:34.400* :  diverted to Bangkok from where our south-east Asia-editor Jonathan Head is following developments.
*25:35.120- 25:39.360* :  We know the plane landed here in Bangkok. It's at the airport now. There were a lot of
*25:39.360- 25:44.500* :  ambulances sent in to deal with those who've been injured. Everyone on board who was hurt,
*25:44.500- 25:47.840* :  well everyone on board will be off the plane by now and all those who are injured will be treated.
*25:48.460- 25:54.420* :  We have had confirmed one fatality. There were 211 passengers and 18 crew members on board. It was
*25:54.420- 26:00.680* :  a Boeing 777 on a normal scheduled flight. It's a long flight from London to Singapore and the
*26:00.680- 26:05.680* :  turbulence was obviously very unexpected and I presume it must have occurred somewhere. We don't
*26:05.680- 26:09.620* :  the exact location but somewhere not too far from Bangkok because that was obviously the first
*26:10.060- 26:14.620* :  airport they were able to land at in order to deal with the injured. But as things stand at the
*26:14.620- 26:20.400* :  moment we're simply awaiting more details of the state of the passengers who were injured and
*26:20.400- 26:24.040* :  possibly a little more detail about exactly what happened. As far as we know and from what
*26:24.040- 26:28.600* :  reports we've been given this was unexpected very sudden severe turbulence that affected
*26:28.600- 26:33.380* :  the aircraft and those passengers who were injured it's likely they were probably not
*26:33.380- 26:39.040* :  going seat belts that's often the case in flights. Jonathan Head, Julian Assange, the founder
*26:39.040- 26:44.340* :  of WikiLeaks which published leaked military documents online has been told he can appeal
*26:44.340- 26:49.360* :  against an extradition request from the United States. He was granted permission by the
*26:49.360- 26:54.760* :  High Court in London to appeal against the order that he be sent to the US to stand trial for
*26:54.760- 27:01.800* :  leaking military secrets in 2010 and 2011. The US argues that the WikiLeaks files which
*27:01.800- 27:06.840* :  disclosed information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars endangered lives.
*27:07.740- 27:12.540* :  Monday's decision means that Mr Assange will now be able to challenge US assurances
*27:13.080- 27:18.640* :  over how any trial would be conducted. His wife Stella gave us her reaction to the ruling.
*27:19.480- 27:27.180* :  It was a relief but this is a just a temporary reprieve. Julian is being prosecuted under
*27:27.680- 27:33.800* :  the 1917 Espionage Act. The thing about this piece of legislation is that it has no public interest
*27:33.800- 27:40.600* :  defense. He cannot say what the documents contained why what the calculation was and of course these
*27:40.600- 27:47.240* :  documents revealed war crimes, evidence of torture, assassination squads, the gravest of international
*27:47.360- 27:52.120* :  state-sponsored crimes and of course this case therefore should never have been brought.
*27:52.780- 27:58.720* :  The case yesterday in court turned on the United States position that because he's an Australian
*27:58.720- 28:06.280* :  national and because the alleged activities, the alleged crimes of possessing and communicating
*28:06.280- 28:11.180* :  publishing took place outside of the United States that he would not have access to the first
*28:11.180- 28:16.460* :  amendment when he's on trial in the United States. This is a constitutional protection that
*28:16.460- 28:22.560* :  Americans would be able to invoke but because he's a foreigner and he was abroad then he would not
*28:22.560- 28:29.540* :  have access to constitutional protections. In the past five months we've had two hearings in which
*28:29.540- 28:37.200* :  if he had lost he would have been immediately processed for extradition potentially within hours
*28:37.200- 28:45.040* :  or a day. So it's been a very very stressful ride and all we have now as I said is a temporary
*28:45.040- 28:51.340* :  reprieve, a permission from the High Court to be able to bring a full appeal in relation to the
*28:51.340- 28:56.680* :  First Amendment, his access to the First Amendment. Stella Assange, the wife of the WikiLeaks founder.
*28:58.340- 29:04.540* :  One of Japan's most popular photo spots is being blocked by authorities frustrated at tourist
*29:04.540- 29:10.860* :  disregarding local rules and wreaking havoc for residents. A big black barrier has been installed
*29:10.860- 29:18.320* :  to obscure views of Mount Fuji. Residents of Fujikawa, Guchiko accused mainly foronturists
*29:18.320- 29:24.520* :  of dropping rubbish and parking illegally as they search for the perfect photo. Our correspondent
*29:24.520- 29:28.020* :  Shima Khalil went to Mount Fuji and sent us this report.
*29:32.100- 29:38.300* :  This is as Japanese as a view can get. I am looking at a convenient store or a
*29:38.300- 29:44.340* :  company as it's known here. The famous Lawson and in the background is the majestic Mount Fuji or
*29:44.340- 29:52.560* :  Fujisan, the ice capped volcano and around me are many many tourists. I can't even begin to count them
*29:52.700- 29:59.740* :  and all of them are aiming their cameras their phones at this view. Chances are you've probably seen
*29:59.740- 30:06.600* :  this on your TikTok or Instagram. This has become the social media money shot for millions of visitors
*30:06.600- 30:12.880* :  who make the trip here. But it's also been the bane of the existence of so many locals who've
*30:12.880- 30:26.120* :  complained and complained about tourists behaving badly. All the tourists cross the streets and they
*30:26.120- 30:30.080* :  don't seem to care about the cars at all. It's dangerous and they leave litter and cigarette
*30:30.080- 30:36.520* :  parts everywhere. Kazuhiko Yawama is 65 years old and has lived in the town of Fujikawa Guchiko
*30:36.520- 30:42.640* :  all his life. His balcony opens up to a view of the beautiful snowy summit and of all the tourists
*30:42.740- 30:50.660* :  clamoring for the perfect snap. As a desperate measure the local authorities are building a barrier
*30:50.660- 30:57.780* :  to block the view but Mr. Yawama's not convinced it will make a difference. I hope we won't have
*30:57.780- 31:02.500* :  to deal with more traffic and the litter problems. But I am worried about tourists stepping out onto
*31:02.500- 31:07.640* :  the streets, take pictures when the black screen goes up. Rizalorente traveled from Australia
*31:08.200- 31:13.300* :  and has just taken the coveted photo. I think it's upsetting for the tourists that's going to come
*31:13.300- 31:19.960* :  here because of those reasons. I think it's a bit sad. We're lucky to be here before that happens.
*31:22.860- 31:28.580* :  Well the crowd is really picking up now in this spot and the local security has been warning people
*31:28.580- 31:33.680* :  blowing his whistle shouting at times selling people to get off the road to cross the street
*31:33.680- 31:37.620* :  properly because there have been so many complaints about tourists blocking traffic.
*31:38.460- 31:43.780* :  You can take a picture of Mount Fuji from many places in this area but as Coralie Nyeki at
*31:43.780- 31:49.020* :  tourist from Germany tells me the prospect of going viral has become a big pull for this particular
*31:49.020- 31:53.660* :  spot. If I didn't have social media, I wouldn't come here, I wouldn't even know that it existed
*31:53.700- 31:59.980* :  this place, like this lawson exists with the picture and because like so many people posted it
*31:59.980- 32:05.460* :  online and maybe just because one person came here took the picture and it went viral, everyone
*32:05.460- 32:12.720* :  came here. For the first time ever Japan has had more than three million visitors two months in a
*32:12.720- 32:18.540* :  row thanks to a weekend and the lifting of post-pandemic restrictions. But it's a tough balance
*32:18.540- 32:23.760* :  to strike for a country with a struggling economy, boosting businesses, while protecting
*32:23.760- 32:33.140* :  residents and popular locations from over tourism. And that's all from us for now but there'll
*32:33.140- 32:37.960* :  be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast,
