*01:26.300- 01:32.780* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 24th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:32.780- 01:37.980* :  Israel says it's recovered three more bodies of Israelis killed by Hamas in the October
*01:37.980- 01:44.020* :  7th attacks. A United Nations special advisor has warned of a risk of genocide in Sudan's
*01:44.020- 01:50.120* :  Darfur region. And emergency efforts are underway after a massive landslide in a remote area
*01:50.120- 01:58.300* :  of Papua New Guinea. Also in this podcast, vaping and smoking had sort of been steadily declining
*01:58.300- 02:04.400* :  across all age groups, but in the time since disposable vapes came popular, discs completely
*02:04.400- 02:10.280* :  shifted. New data on the use of disposable vapes says they're driving up nicotine use among
*02:10.280- 02:20.020* :  young people who say they would never have taken up smoking. On October 7th last year,
*02:20.020- 02:26.000* :  around 250 people were taken captive when Hamas attacked Israel. These Israelis believe
*02:26.000- 02:31.740* :  around 130 are still being held in Gaza. Last week, Israel said it had recovered the
*02:31.740- 02:36.580* :  bodies of three hostages from the territory. Now a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces
*02:36.580- 02:43.780* :  Daniel Haggari says three more have been found. It is with a heavy heart that I share that last night
*02:44.700- 02:50.100* :  Israeli special forces in Gaza rescued the bodies of our hostages,
*02:57.420- 03:04.400* :  their bodies were rescued during a special operation based on precise intelligence in the area
*03:04.540- 03:11.420* :  of Gaza. Dan Johnson, our correspondent in Jerusalem told us more. So they were recovered overnight
*03:11.420- 03:18.020* :  by the IDF, which has been operating again in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza.
*03:18.020- 03:22.820* :  This is an area that had previously been declared free of Hamas fighters, but it's somewhere
*03:22.820- 03:27.920* :  they've gone back to. They've been taking out active Hamas units there, but also following up
*03:27.920- 03:33.020* :  intelligence on where there is further Hamas infrastructure, including underground tunnels.
*03:33.020- 03:37.440* :  And we believe it's with that intelligence that they've been able to locate and recover
*03:37.440- 03:44.560* :  the bodies of these three men. Now Hanan, Yablanka and Aureon Hanandes were both killed trying to
*03:44.560- 03:50.200* :  escape the Nova Music Festival in the south of Israel on the morning of Saturday the 7th of
*03:50.200- 03:56.320* :  October when Hamas fighters crossed from Gaza and stormed that music festival. These two men tried
*03:56.320- 04:02.420* :  to escape, but were killed in the process. And we now know that their bodies were taken to Gaza
*04:02.420- 04:07.080* :  straight away, even though there was no information for many months about where they were.
*04:07.080- 04:11.600* :  There had been hopes that they had survived, but recent evidence came to light that they had
*04:11.600- 04:17.200* :  been killed in that attack and their bodies taken to Gaza. And the same is true of Michel Nisenbaum,
*04:17.200- 04:23.000* :  who was 59. He was a grandfather who actually set off driving that morning to the south of Gaza
*04:23.000- 04:28.260* :  to try to rescue his four-year-old granddaughter having seen the news of what was happening.
*04:28.260- 04:33.240* :  That's when he encountered Hamas units. He too was killed and his body taken to Gaza.
*04:33.620- 04:38.520* :  Those three hostages' bodies have now been recovered successfully and will be returned to their
*04:38.520- 04:44.200* :  families. But this has prompted the families of other hostages to reissue their demand this morning
*04:44.200- 04:49.900* :  for a deal to be negotiated to secure the successful return of hostages who are still alive.
*04:50.580- 04:55.540* :  Now, meanwhile, Israel obviously has been under a lot of pressure internationally over its
*04:55.540- 05:00.620* :  military operations in Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has actually been invited to address a joint
*05:00.620- 05:07.480* :  session of the U.S. Congress. What's your assessment of that? Yes, this is a proposal from the
*05:07.480- 05:13.040* :  Speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Netanyahu has spoken to both houses of Congress before.
*05:13.040- 05:19.040* :  Three times, actually, this would be an unprecedented fourth, but it will be hugely divisive in America.
*05:19.040- 05:23.720* :  I'm sure Mr Netanyahu will want to take the opportunity, his reliant on U.S. support,
*05:23.720- 05:28.360* :  and especially if he's facing the international arrest warrants that have been sought against him.
*05:28.640- 05:33.020* :  The United States not signed up to the International Criminal Court will be one of the few places
*05:33.020- 05:37.960* :  that he's able to travel. So I'm sure he'd want to take the opportunity, but there will be huge
*05:37.960- 05:44.960* :  division in American society. I'm sure we will see enormous protests in opposition and the
*05:44.960- 05:50.200* :  huge political dilemma for Joe Biden. If Benjamin Netanyahu is in Congress, is he going to be invited
*05:50.200- 05:55.240* :  to the White House? Will Joe Biden effectively boycott the visit? A lot of politics to
*05:55.920- 06:01.800* :  calculate with a visit like that, which will pose huge questions and dilemmas for Joe Biden and
*06:01.800- 06:07.000* :  others in U.S. politics. And looking at the international pressure on Israel, there have been
*06:07.000- 06:12.120* :  several instances this week, including three European countries saying that they would formally
*06:12.120- 06:17.140* :  recognize a Palestinian state, for instance. How is all of this playing out? Yes, there's been
*06:17.140- 06:22.460* :  furious angry reaction to the move made by Spain, Ireland and Norway, but in particular,
*06:22.460- 06:29.020* :  the spat is escalating with the Spanish. A Spanish minister was heard in a speech saying that
*06:29.020- 06:35.420* :  she supported Palestine being free from the river to the sea. That's been declared anti-Semitic by
*06:35.420- 06:40.340* :  figures in Israeli politics. It's prompted Israel's foreign minister to say that he will block
*06:40.340- 06:46.560* :  Spanish consular officials in Jerusalem, assisting Palestinians from the West Bank, and there's
*06:46.560- 06:52.160* :  been a response from the Spanish foreign minister saying that move is unacceptable. All three countries
*06:52.160- 06:57.460* :  ambassadors in Israel were hauled into the foreign ministry. They were actually shown a video
*06:57.460- 07:03.320* :  of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, so the Israelis could underline how they feel that
*07:03.740- 07:08.860* :  this move made by all three nations to recognize Palestinian statehood at this time is effectively
*07:08.860- 07:14.620* :  in their view rewarding Hamas for the terror attacks it carried out on the 7th of October,
*07:15.020- 07:17.340* :  while it is still holding hostages in Gaza.
*07:19.440- 07:25.460* :  A United Nations adviser has told the BBC that Sudan's Western Darfur region is on the verge of
*07:25.460- 07:31.480* :  a genocide. Alice Wai Rimu and Aritu, the UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide,
*07:31.480- 07:36.280* :  said the rapid support forces were targeting communities based on their ethnicity.
*07:37.140- 07:42.660* :  Around a million civilians are trapped in the city of El Fasha in Darfur as Sudan's army tries
*07:42.660- 07:46.220* :  to fight off the advancing paramilitary group, the RSF.
*07:46.860- 07:50.860* :  People inside that city have been sending us voice messages on their phones every day
*07:50.860- 07:52.980* :  for the past week, and here is one of those.
*07:53.360- 07:58.380* :  This man who wants to remain anonymous is in the upshook refugee camp on the fringes of
*07:58.380- 07:58.880* :  Elfasha.
*07:59.440- 08:03.940* :  He says RSF fighters are coming inside the camp and randomly killing people.
*08:04.920- 08:12.380* :  I actually don't know how to describe the situation that we are facing nowadays, but everything
*08:12.380- 08:19.640* :  is getting bad, fighting is everywhere, and during the last two days we have been freezing
*08:19.640- 08:27.860* :  or so many challenges, especially when the RSF are trying to take over the city, and
*08:27.860- 08:31.000* :  then they can't do to fight.
*08:31.700- 08:38.260* :  There has been so many casualties in the camp when people have been killed.
*08:38.980- 08:40.340* :  Do you an adviser on genocide?
*08:40.580- 08:44.760* :  Alice Wai Rimu and Dorito addressed the security council on the issue earlier this week,
*08:45.300- 08:46.500* :  and she spoke to James Cognol.
*08:47.020- 08:50.820* :  The situation now bears for the max of the risk of genocide.
*08:51.240- 08:52.500* :  How do you come to that conclusion?
*08:53.340- 08:59.160* :  We put together this risk factors from observing what kind of conditions existed in previous
*08:59.160- 09:04.340* :  circumstances where genocide occurred, and looking at the verdicts that came out of the
*09:04.340- 09:09.360* :  positions where people were convicted for the crime of genocide, we are able to predict
*09:09.360- 09:12.960* :  that a genocide could be occurring or has occurred.
*09:13.380- 09:19.900* :  And to be clear here, we are talking about genocide towards the Zagawa, Masalit and
*09:19.900- 09:26.420* :  for ethnic groups in Darfur, carried out by the rapid support forces, the RSF and Allied
*09:26.720- 09:27.460* :  Arab militia.
*09:27.880- 09:33.860* :  That's what we are discussing here, specifically targeted towards the ethnic communities who
*09:33.860- 09:36.560* :  also happen to be the murder of a scheme.
*09:37.080- 09:44.160* :  There is a long history in Darfur of conflict between the Zagawa, Masalit and for who see
*09:44.160- 09:48.740* :  themselves as African and Arab groups within Darfur.
*09:49.340- 09:55.640* :  Why do you think we at the point now where you are raising these incredibly worrying concerns
*09:55.640- 09:57.340* :  about the possibility of genocide?
*09:57.880- 10:03.120* :  Because these are an absence of accountability for genocide in related crimes, we've seen
*10:03.120- 10:05.800* :  it contributing to the current episodes of horror.
*10:06.440- 10:10.060* :  And so we must keep supporting the work of those who are documenting what's happening.
*10:10.300- 10:15.140* :  There are concerns that what is happening in terms of the targeting of civilians could
*10:15.140- 10:21.700* :  really accelerate if the RSF overrun Elfasha, is that a concern you share?
*10:22.700- 10:29.400* :  It's a concern I share, and when I went to Chad and visited the people who had managed
*10:29.400- 10:37.280* :  to escape and when I was a spoke to other refugees who are now in Uganda, in Egypt, they
*10:37.280- 10:40.880* :  all spoke about being targeted by the RSF.
*10:41.300- 10:48.460* :  And these attacks in villages outside Elfasha, clearly the reassigns of not having military
*10:49.040- 10:52.780* :  objectives and that they are just meant to cause displacement and fear.
*10:53.200- 10:58.020* :  And these people are telling me they were being accused by the RSF of supporting the Sudanese
*10:58.020- 10:58.720* :  armed forces.
*10:59.320- 11:05.400* :  They told me about sexual violence, they told me about the looting of property, how their
*11:05.400- 11:08.340* :  life stock was russled, how their crops were destroyed.
*11:09.120- 11:14.800* :  This complete total breakdown of law and other, I have said that the UN Secretary-General
*11:14.800- 11:21.520* :  Antoni Guterres has said it too, that increased hostilities in Elfasha have now opened a
*11:21.520- 11:23.640* :  really alarming each update in this conflict.
*11:24.460- 11:28.640* :  And now he called for a concerted global push for a ceasefire.
*11:29.520- 11:32.500* :  For me, I'm calling for the same, and I'm also calling for attention.
*11:33.180- 11:37.720* :  I've been trying to get my voice out, but the war in Gaza, the war in Ukraine have
*11:37.720- 11:43.140* :  drawn out the fact that we are calling out that they are risk factors for atrocity
*11:43.140- 11:45.700* :  crimes, war crimes in genocide in Sudan.
*11:46.160- 11:51.020* :  And specifically in the fall, people have been targeted there on the basis of their ethnicity.
*11:51.860- 11:56.260* :  Alice Waiarimu and Aritu, the United Nations Special Advisor of the Secretary-General
*11:56.260- 11:59.980* :  on the Prevention of Genocide, and she was speaking to James Coppnell.
*12:01.340- 12:05.980* :  As many as a hundred people are feared to have been killed by a huge landslide in Papua New Guinea,
*12:06.440- 12:11.480* :  thousands of tons of rocks and debris cascaded onto a village in a remote area in the north,
*12:11.480- 12:14.500* :  a desperate search is now underway to find survivors.
*12:20.980- 12:24.560* :  Belinda Cora is a reporter for ABC in the Capitol Port Moorsby.
*12:24.780- 12:27.400* :  Very shocking news across the country, in Papua New Guinea.
*12:27.400- 12:33.520* :  At this time, we are still to confirm any details, specific details to the debt toll,
*12:33.640- 12:38.220* :  and of course, some recovery efforts at this time due to the accessibility at this time,
*12:39.120- 12:45.280* :  the rugged terrains with this disaster actually happen is now becoming a shoe-and-challenge for
*12:45.280- 12:50.840* :  authorities. The landslide had covered the main highway, so the accessibility into the area
*12:50.840- 12:57.940* :  out would be via chopper or probably airplane, but at this time they cannot be able to actually
*12:57.940- 13:01.360* :  confirm if there's help as actually arriving the area.
*13:01.900- 13:06.960* :  Scores of homes have been buried. Andrew Wings spoke to the BBC from the site of the disaster,
*13:07.580- 13:10.020* :  and he said hundreds of people might have lost their lives.
*13:28.860- 13:33.660* :  Australia's Foreign Minister has said her country is ready to assist in recovery efforts.
*13:33.660- 13:38.520* :  The social media pictures show a section of mountainside that appears to have broken away
*13:38.520- 13:41.640* :  our reporter Phil Mercer is monitoring events from Australia.
*13:42.260- 13:47.940* :  In the middle of the night, about three o'clock in the morning, a part of a nearby mountain simply
*13:47.940- 13:54.900* :  gave way, sharing a village nearby with rocks and other debris, and those social media
*13:54.900- 14:01.800* :  videos you describe show boulders, some as big as cars, and also other large trees,
*14:01.800- 14:09.700* :  people clambering over the debris using machetes and axes to try to free people underneath.
*14:09.700- 14:17.220* :  Now, the big question at the moment is how many people have been affected? We simply don't know.
*14:17.220- 14:23.180* :  We've heard from the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape, who says that national
*14:23.760- 14:28.580* :  relief efforts will be deployed, and he says that information is still coming in,
*14:28.640- 14:35.520* :  and a big part of the problem is that anger provinces extremely remote, and some of the roads
*14:35.520- 14:41.560* :  up near the landslide have also been blocked. And as you say, there's a lot that we can't possibly
*14:41.560- 14:47.920* :  know yet, but what sorts of numbers are in that region? Do we have any idea about the sorts of
*14:47.920- 14:54.120* :  numbers of people who could be affected? Well, there is speculation that 100 people or more could
*14:54.220- 14:59.840* :  be trapped or missing, and this is all happening in a very remote part of Papua New Guinea.
*15:00.440- 15:05.540* :  And when you look at the country it occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea,
*15:05.540- 15:12.040* :  it's home to about 10 million people. It's also home to an amazing array of Indigenous
*15:12.040- 15:18.160* :  languages, more than 850, and the reason, or one of the reasons there are so many languages,
*15:18.220- 15:24.780* :  is that so many of these communities live for pretty isolated lives. So that explains firstly,
*15:24.780- 15:32.420* :  why the emergency effort regarding the landslide is taking time, and also secondly, while information,
*15:32.420- 15:37.560* :  detailed information about the number of people affected, is also slow to emerge.
*15:38.200- 15:45.080* :  That was Phil Mercer. China's armed forces have practiced seizing key areas in and around Taiwan
*15:45.080- 15:50.300* :  on a second day of military exercises around the island. The Chinese Army released an animated
*15:50.300- 15:56.320* :  video showing missiles raining down on Taiwan, a self-governing territory that Beijing claims
*15:56.320- 16:01.200* :  Mickey Bristol reports. China has focused its attention on securing the
*16:01.200- 16:06.680* :  sea and airspace to the east of Taiwan. It deployed fighter jets armed with live weapons.
*16:07.460- 16:13.260* :  Beijing is also trying to frighten people in Taiwan. It released an animated video showing missiles
*16:13.260- 16:18.600* :  raining down on the island, a self-governing territory that Beijing considers its own.
*16:19.160- 16:25.620* :  The island's new president, Leiching Duer, came to power just four days ago. In his inaugural address,
*16:26.180- 16:31.460* :  he urged China to stop its military intimidation. That request has been ignored.
*16:32.360- 16:33.100* :  That was Mickey Bristol.
*16:35.940- 16:41.960* :  Still to come in this podcast, revisiting South Africa, 30 years on from the nation's first democratic
*16:41.960- 16:48.800* :  election and the week before the next one. We are very unequal, but what doesn't expect
*16:48.800- 16:52.980* :  the present government to have cured everything within 30 years?
*17:00.980- 17:07.480* :  It's that time of the year. Your vacation is coming up. You can already hear the beach waves,

*18:07.180- 18:11.040* :  It was estimated a few years ago that 80 million people around the world use
*18:11.040- 18:16.540* :  e-cigarettes or vapes. They're marketed as less harmful than tobacco and helpful to people who
*18:16.540- 18:21.120* :  are trying to quit smoking. But a new study in England says that they're driving up the use of
*18:21.120- 18:26.440* :  nicotine among young people. The data compiled by researchers at University College London
*18:26.920- 18:32.900* :  found the use of disposable vapes had tripled among 18 to 24-year-olds while smoking has
*18:32.900- 18:39.000* :  barely fallen. It also discovered that people who would never have taken up smoking were now vaping.
*18:39.140- 18:43.480* :  Louis is a 21-year-old student who started vaping before he smoked at age 18.
*18:57.100- 19:01.240* :  Smell as much. You can do it in your house. You can do it anywhere you want to without
*19:01.840- 19:05.620* :  serious consequences. Obviously, you can't really smoke in the house. Obviously,
*19:05.900- 19:10.840* :  you can't get a big smell. With vaping, it leaves no trace pretty much. I find it's much easier
*19:10.880- 19:15.440* :  to give up cigarettes than it is to give up vaping. I think vaping is so convenient and it's cheap
*19:15.440- 19:20.540* :  and it's available. If it was even 10, 20, 30 years earlier, I'd probably be on cigarettes all the
*19:20.540- 19:26.020* :  time. Dr Harry Tasson Birch, lead author of the study and research fellow in behavioral
*19:26.020- 19:30.200* :  science and health at University College London, told us more about what they found.
*19:30.920- 19:35.480* :  We've been monitoring trends in smoking and vaping in the population for a really long time now,
*19:36.060- 19:42.700* :  and one of the biggest changes that occurred was since around mid-2021, we saw the introduction
*19:42.800- 19:49.660* :  of these modern disposable vapes and they really rapidly became popular among young people.
*19:49.660- 19:55.280* :  What we wanted to see was whether there's been an impact of this rise in disposable vaping on
*19:55.280- 20:01.020* :  overall trends in smoking and vaping in England. Vaping and smoking had sort of been steadily declining
*20:01.080- 20:07.140* :  across all age groups, but in the time since disposable vapes became popular, discs completely
*20:07.140- 20:15.700* :  shifted. The percentage of 18 to 24-year-olds who were tripled from 9% to 29%, so almost a third of
*20:16.300- 20:23.080* :  young adults now who were vaping, smoking continued to decline but just not as quickly as the vaping
*20:23.580- 20:29.740* :  which meant that overall we've seen an increase in the percentage of young people using nicotine.
*20:30.360- 20:35.020* :  If we look at people who report having never regularly smoked, that's where we saw the biggest
*20:35.020- 20:42.920* :  increase, where it went from 2% to 9%. The slight nuance there is that in the old age groups where
*20:42.920- 20:49.480* :  there were smaller increases in vaping, smoking declined more slowly or not as well, so it is likely
*20:49.480- 20:54.560* :  that some people have been diverted away from smoking cigarettes. There's a lot of evidence now to
*20:54.560- 21:01.340* :  show that vaping is likely to be much less harmful than cigarettes smoking, so whether it's a good or
*21:01.340- 21:06.080* :  bad thing for an individual depends on what that individual would otherwise be doing. If they'd otherwise
*21:06.080- 21:10.400* :  be smoking cigarettes, it's a good thing that they're vaping, but obviously we don't want to see
*21:10.400- 21:17.880* :  lots of people who have never smoked starting to vape. Dr Harry Tatton Butch. Over the last two weeks,
*21:17.880- 21:23.820* :  Russia has taken advantage of a weakened Ukrainian front line in the Kharkiv region in northeastern
*21:23.820- 21:29.180* :  Ukraine. There are reports of fierce fighting with Russian forces saying that they've captured
*21:29.180- 21:34.840* :  another village in the nearby Donetsk region. Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, has managed
*21:34.840- 21:40.700* :  to reach the city of Kharkiv and he spoke to us from there. At the moment, I'm at the beginning
*21:40.700- 21:46.500* :  of a funeral for a policeman who was killed evacuating civilians from the frontline in turn of
*21:46.500- 21:51.720* :  Vochance, where a lot of the fighting is going on. Really, it was an unbearably solemn and sad
*21:51.720- 21:56.640* :  occasion here for the people. You had the feeling really of people who are in this very much for the
*21:56.640- 22:05.940* :  long haul who are in for them an existential struggle for their their nation and you know there's
*22:05.940- 22:12.240* :  a sense of determination, but yesterday I was at the not far from here a place which was hit by
*22:12.240- 22:17.660* :  Russian missiles and then you also got this feeling from their point of view that they're quite
*22:17.660- 22:23.380* :  defenseless in many ways because that Russian fuselage of missiles they weren't able to knock any
*22:23.380- 22:27.020* :  of them out of the air because they don't have the air defense that they would like to have.
*22:27.220- 22:32.200* :  I think they feel they're in a really difficult struggle here. They say they've stabilized the
*22:32.220- 22:37.680* :  front line. They've moved some more experienced units but they're also very aware that what the
*22:37.680- 22:45.900* :  Russians are trying to do is to stretch out what already quite thinly manned positions to make it
*22:45.900- 22:52.900* :  easier for them to attack elsewhere particularly southeast of here in the the Donbass area where they
*22:52.900- 22:57.180* :  are still pushing hard and where the Russians are claiming to have taken more villages and certainly
*22:57.180- 23:01.720* :  they've had more movement there from the Russian point of view than they've had for many months and
*23:01.720- 23:08.220* :  that's because the the Ukrainians don't have the soldiers that they require and they don't have the
*23:08.220- 23:13.220* :  heavy artillery and they don't have the air defenses so the Russians are able to use their Air Force
*23:13.240- 23:19.360* :  in a way that they they weren't able to earlier in the war so for the Ukrainians and this comes from
*23:19.360- 23:25.100* :  President Zelensky down there in a very very difficult position at the moment because even though
*23:25.100- 23:31.000* :  the Americans have okayed those deliveries of weapons you know it's going to take weeks and
*23:31.000- 23:37.440* :  months to get here. That was Jeremy Bowen in Ukraine. South Africans head to the polls next week
*23:37.440- 23:42.480* :  30 years on from the nation's first democratic election which followed decades of a brutal
*23:42.480- 23:48.300* :  and racist apartheid regime. The BBC's Furgle Keen was reporting there at the time and has returned
*23:48.300- 23:52.820* :  to the country to see what has changed. He sent this report from Johannesburg.
*23:58.740- 24:03.500* :  White rule on the continent of Africa came to an end at seven o'clock South African time this morning.
*24:03.580- 24:08.920* :  It did not come through violent rebellion. There were no cheers. We're looking at a line of people,
*24:08.920- 24:16.040* :  elderly people, the sick stretching right around this church and down as far as I could see into
*24:16.040- 24:20.500* :  the distance along the road here. The most striking thing that was said to me that morning.
*24:20.500- 24:25.880* :  I asked an elderly man whose name was Simon Captain. He'd lost one of his sons to the struggle,
*24:25.880- 24:33.860* :  another in exile and I said to what does today mean to you and he said today I became a human being once more.
*24:37.040- 24:44.980* :  30 years later democracy has endured but so too has staggering inequality. 10% of the population
*24:45.140- 24:53.820* :  owns over 80% of the wealth. About half an hour's drive away from the rally at Rabi Ridge north
*24:53.820- 24:59.960* :  of Johannesburg. There's a vast field of flattened tin and plastic shelters that belonged to
*24:59.960- 25:05.960* :  thousands of people evicted from state land that was slated for development. Houses for the poor
*25:05.960- 25:13.140* :  are meant to be built here but the backlog is huge and the waiting is long. A tent has been set up
*25:13.320- 25:16.020* :  which has just got a roof basically and everything else is open to the elements
*25:16.020- 25:23.260* :  and open to the main road. Cars, trucks, everything passing by and right across from me there are
*25:23.260- 25:28.160* :  women and children sleeping there and as I just turn around I can see the tower blocks of
*25:28.160- 25:35.480* :  Santa shining modern business development area with acre after acre of homes with swimming pools
*25:35.480- 25:42.520* :  and it just reinforces the massive inequality that persists in this society 30 years after the
*25:42.520- 25:47.980* :  democratic elections. The reason why I came this side I wanted to build a foundation for my sibling
*25:47.980- 25:54.060* :  so that they can have a warm home. Story Alala came to Johannesburg like generations before her
*25:54.060- 25:59.080* :  because she believed there would be work here but unemployment is now running at over 30%
*25:59.500- 26:05.140* :  and billions of pounds have been squandered through corruption. We don't feel as if we have the
*26:05.140- 26:10.480* :  freedom that we need to have. There's a whole lot of corruption happening as a human being living
*26:10.480- 26:15.860* :  here I feel oppressed by my government and I feel discriminated.
*26:19.180- 26:23.040* :  Back in Soweto near the church where I'd watch people vote for the first time
*26:23.100- 26:29.380* :  a group of elderly people chatted in the fading light of afternoon. Here I heard the suspicion
*26:29.380- 26:35.780* :  that people's gratitude for liberation 30 years ago had saved success of ANC governments
*26:35.780- 26:41.940* :  from voter dissatisfaction. I think the politicians they took advantage because we were happy.
*26:42.580- 26:47.820* :  Are you still happy with South Africa? Oh well that's not my issue because the red
*26:47.820- 26:55.920* :  testings now took advantage. Isaac Milletzi and you are 82 years of age. We are very
*26:55.920- 27:02.860* :  unequal society but what doesn't expect the present government to have cured everything
*27:02.860- 27:09.880* :  within 30 years. I should vote because I must have a voice tomorrow. The devil you know
*27:10.140- 27:13.220* :  it's better than the devil that you don't know. Do you mean the ANC?
*27:17.040- 27:22.240* :  An older generation that remembers the pain of a party might be more forgiving in the coming
*27:22.240- 27:30.040* :  polls but enduring inequality and anger over corruption means the ANC, Africa's oldest liberation
*27:30.040- 27:35.840* :  movement can no longer take for granted the votes of the excluded and the poor.
*27:36.700- 27:43.680* :  That was Virgil Keen. Now as we have been recording this podcast the UN's highest court has been
*27:43.680- 27:48.460* :  ruling and it says that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in Rafa.
*27:48.460- 27:52.720* :  The case was brought to the International Court of Justice by South Africa which accuses
*27:52.720- 27:58.480* :  Israel of violating the genocide convention. It argued an injunction is vital to ensure the
*27:58.480- 28:03.340* :  survival of the Palestinian people. The Israeli government has said no power on earth would stop
*28:03.340- 28:10.540* :  it protecting its citizens and pursuing Hamas in Gaza. The ICJ has no enforcement powers but any
*28:10.540- 28:16.380* :  decision against Israel would carry international weight. That is news that's just breaking as we record
*28:16.380- 28:21.220* :  this edition of the Global News Podcast. There will be a lot more on that in the next edition
*28:21.220- 28:27.940* :  recorded later. Supporters of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan have clashed with
*28:27.940- 28:32.800* :  government workers sent in with bulldozers to demolish his party's headquarters in Islamabad.
*28:32.800- 28:37.880* :  The government said part of the building had been constructed illegally from Islamabad
*28:37.880- 28:43.900* :  Caroline Davis reports. Late last night officials in Islamabad arrived at Imran Khan's party
*28:43.900- 28:50.360* :  headquarters in the capital with diggers. The building they said had been constructed
*28:50.360- 28:55.820* :  violating building bylaws and that despite government notices the party had not complied.
*28:56.140- 29:01.760* :  Now they were here to shut it down. Mr Khan has been in prison since last August but his
*29:01.760- 29:06.340* :  party has continued to operate. He's accused the authorities and Pakistan's powerful
*29:06.340- 29:12.120* :  military of targeting him and his party which both deny. In February's elections candidates
*29:12.120- 29:17.940* :  affiliated to Mr Khan won the largest number of seats. They are in opposition after other parties
*29:17.940- 29:24.060* :  formed an alliance. Footage shows the government officials met by anger at the site. Mr Khan's
*29:24.060- 29:29.040* :  party called the act patently illegal and unlawful saying that they did not have enough time
*29:29.040- 29:34.640* :  to file a petition. Several leaders of the party and more than 20 party workers have been charged
*29:34.640- 29:39.420* :  with attacking officials and firing weapons in the air during the incident. The headquarters
*29:39.420- 29:46.180* :  have now been sealed. Caroline Davis in Islamabad. A familiar site will be missing at this year's
*29:46.180- 29:52.280* :  Olympics. The Uzbek gymnast, Oksana Chusovitina, has announced that she has an injury and will
*29:52.280- 29:58.180* :  miss the qualifying stage for the Paris Olympics. Chusovitina is no ordinary athlete. She's 48
*29:58.180- 30:04.580* :  years old and first competed in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Jessica Wilkins is following her
*30:04.580- 30:10.380* :  story. So what do we know about the injury? We don't actually know a lot about her injury. She
*30:10.380- 30:15.880* :  hasn't been specific at all. She did make the announcement earlier on an Instagram video but most
*30:15.880- 30:20.360* :  of that was thanking her fans for their support and apologising for the fact that she wasn't going
*30:20.360- 30:25.060* :  to be able to compete at the Asian Games. She's sustained an injury that will make competing
*30:25.080- 30:30.700* :  there impossible and it really was her last chance to qualify for the Olympics via the Asian
*30:30.700- 30:35.420* :  Championships. However, it should be noted that in order to get that qualifying slot she would have
*30:35.420- 30:40.860* :  had to have won best overall athlete in gymnastics in order to do so, which is a tall order at any age
*30:40.860- 30:46.240* :  but at 48 would have been really quite spectacular. As you say, it's been a very long career. What drove
*30:46.260- 30:52.280* :  her to keep competing? She competed under three different teams. That was partly to do with politics
*30:52.280- 30:56.920* :  but more importantly to do with the health of her son. He was diagnosed with leukemia at the age
*30:56.920- 31:00.980* :  of three and it became apparent that he was not going to be able to get the medical support he
*31:00.980- 31:07.080* :  needed in Uzbekistan. She was able to relocate to Cologne in Germany but that was under the condition
*31:07.080- 31:11.740* :  that she competed for the German team and through a variety of sports clubs and the Olympic team
*31:11.740- 31:17.040* :  in Germany she was able to pay for all the medical bills and treatment that her son needed and
*31:17.400- 31:22.840* :  we should say that her son is now happy and healthy and in his 20s so it did all come good in the end.
*31:23.480- 31:28.540* :  As you say at the age of 48 it has been a long career. Most gymnasts are not competing at that age
*31:28.840- 31:34.780* :  so is this the end of her career? Well we don't officially know yet. Now it would be a shame if it was
*31:34.880- 31:39.480* :  though if you want to put it in perspective at how long her career it was she first competed in 1992
*31:39.480- 31:44.700* :  at the Barcelona Games and that was under the ban out of the unified team which was what the
*31:44.700- 31:50.480* :  old team of the Soviet Union was referred to. Now she won a gold team medal there but she did
*31:50.480- 31:56.020* :  apparently retire once for 12 hours changed her mind and then on top of that she was meant to retire
*31:56.020- 32:00.920* :  after the Tokyo Games but again didn't bother in the end so this might be it it might not.
*32:00.920- 32:07.080* :  That was Jessica Wilkins and that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the
*32:07.080- 32:11.560* :  Global News Podcast later. If you'd like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in
