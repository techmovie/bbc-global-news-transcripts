*01:27.940- 01:33.200* :  this is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Nick Miles and at 30
*01:33.200- 01:38.340* :  hours GMT on Wednesday the 8th of May these are our main stories the world's oceans have broken
*01:38.340- 01:44.280* :  temperature records every day over the past year. Israel reopens one of the main aid crossings
*01:44.280- 01:50.300* :  into Gaza but thousands of people flee raffer ahead of an expected ground incursion. A BBC
*01:51.180- 01:57.100* :  investigation uncovers clear ties between members of Germany's AFD party and former neo-Nazi
*01:57.100- 02:04.500* :  networks. The AFD clearly states a political point of view turning Germany into something that
*02:04.500- 02:15.980* :  we've only seen between 1933 and 45. Also in this podcast how a peanut and milk allergy trial
*02:15.980- 02:22.220* :  is transforming lives and the man from Nepal dedicating his life to the conservation of owls.
*02:28.180- 02:33.700* :  We start with a stark warning about the impact of climate change. The world's oceans have
*02:33.700- 02:40.540* :  broken temperature records every single day over the past year. The BBC analysis is based on data
*02:40.540- 02:47.800* :  from the European Union's Copernicus climate service nearly 50 days have smashed existing highs
*02:47.800- 02:54.500* :  for the time of year by the largest margin in the satellite era just in rolet is our climate editor.
*02:55.040- 02:59.780* :  It's a confirmation of something that we all knew which is that the world has been going through
*02:59.780- 03:06.420* :  this extraordinarily warm streak as you say every single day for an entire year has set a new
*03:06.820- 03:11.600* :  daily average sea surface temperature record for that day. That is an extraordinary thing to happen.
*03:11.600- 03:16.820* :  We're not inching past the previous records we are really blasting through them. So one around
*03:16.820- 03:23.720* :  47 days the existing high was exceeded by at least a third of a degree Celsius. Now that may not
*03:23.720- 03:29.620* :  sound much but remember this is an average across the season oceans of the entire world so that
*03:29.620- 03:35.460* :  is a huge margin and it isn't just sea temperatures that have been incredibly high it is also air
*03:35.460- 03:42.740* :  temperatures so this April April 2024 was the warmest April ever ordered that extends to 11 months
*03:42.780- 03:48.280* :  the successive months that have set new temperature records for that month. So you know there's a
*03:48.280- 03:53.680* :  kind of cacophony of extraordinary global temperature records that are being broken which sells us
*03:54.020- 03:59.160* :  the ongoing impacts of climate change. And Justin just briefly it's deal with what skeptics might
*03:59.160- 04:04.360* :  say is that they say that this coincides with the El Nino event which warms the the waters anyway
*04:04.360- 04:08.220* :  what do you say to that? Well that's absolutely right yes it does it's a strong
*04:08.660- 04:13.420* :  El Nino we're going out of it now and that adds an extra kind of punch of energy of extra punch of
*04:13.420- 04:19.340* :  heat to the atmosphere but against a background of ever increasing global temperatures because
*04:19.340- 04:25.660* :  of climate change. So the last big El Nino event was back in 2016 we saw new record temperatures set
*04:25.660- 04:31.780* :  then but we're now exceeding them in 2024 and that tells us that each time these El Nino's hit
*04:31.780- 04:37.600* :  global warming is driving average global temperatures up and as I say affecting sea temperatures
*04:37.600- 04:42.580* :  all around the world. I'm in North Wales and the populations and plants and animals here are
*04:42.580- 04:47.820* :  a place that you consider temperate and pretty stable are changing as a result of rising sea
*04:47.820- 04:53.140* :  temperatures around the UK. And we can hear now from Professor Ian Barber from the University
*04:53.140- 04:59.180* :  of Aberystwyth in Wales can't we? There is a Japanese species of sea squirt it's as
*04:59.180- 05:05.260* :  called a carpet sea squirt. They form a blanket a carpet if you like over the sea bed they prevent
*05:05.260- 05:11.520* :  the growth of native organisms in the areas that they colonize because they do so well in our
*05:11.520- 05:16.260* :  environment they can potentially take over huge areas of the sea bed. Justin that's a very local
*05:16.260- 05:22.520* :  impact but what are the broader impacts of these rapidly warming oceans particularly on corals
*05:22.520- 05:28.320* :  things like that? Yeah the coral is a really tragic story so it was announced a few weeks back
*05:28.320- 05:35.420* :  but the world is experiencing a global mass coral bleaching event. Coral has a sort of symbiotic
*05:35.420- 05:41.620* :  algae inside it and when the sea temperatures get too high it ejects that algae and goes white
*05:41.620- 05:47.900* :  that's why it's called bleaching and can die as a result so an incredible threat to global corals
*05:48.220- 05:53.460* :  and as people probably know coral it doesn't have a much of the sea bed but is an incredible
*05:53.460- 05:59.040* :  source of biodiversity home to a quarter of marine species so that's the kind of tropical oceans
*05:59.040- 06:04.160* :  affected. We're also seeing impacts in Antarctica and the Arctic so in Antarctica and
*06:04.160- 06:09.100* :  Papanguins are struggling to breed on the ice because the ice is breaking away underneath them
*06:09.100- 06:16.820* :  so impacts all over the globe. Justin Rowlett talks to find a ceasefire in Gaza have restarted
*06:16.820- 06:22.620* :  in Cairo just as the Israeli military stepped up its bombing of the south of the territory.
*06:23.220- 06:27.560* :  Conditions on the ground are getting worse for the tens of thousands of garrisons who've been
*06:27.560- 06:33.760* :  ordered to leave the city of Raffa by the Israeli military. Speaking from there Moses Condorway
*06:33.760- 06:39.540* :  of Project Hope that's a humanitarian healthcare organization said their work had been affected
*06:39.540- 06:45.800* :  by the closure of crossing points for aid. We had a team of specialist surgeons who were supposed
*06:45.800- 06:53.800* :  to cross from Cairo into Raffa to support some of the critical health facilities which are
*06:53.800- 07:01.160* :  providing secondary emergency care for people who have been impacted by the war but due to
*07:01.160- 07:09.720* :  the security issues around the border crossings all movements of the UN and aid agents's
*07:09.720- 07:17.140* :  convoys into Raffa with cancer. Israel has now announced one of the main crossing points
*07:17.140- 07:22.060* :  has been reopened. Our correspondent in Jerusalem Yulanael has just filed this report.
*07:22.860- 07:27.380* :  Plumes of smoke from Israeli airstrikes have been seen over Raffa and heavy gun fires
*07:27.380- 07:32.380* :  been heard. Israeli forces say they've killed what they call Hamas terrorists and destroyed
*07:32.380- 07:38.220* :  tunnel shafts. To the east of the city the Kremlin on crossing a vital route for humanitarian
*07:38.220- 07:44.040* :  supplies was said to have been reopened by Israel earlier. It was closed on Sunday after Hamas
*07:44.040- 07:50.580* :  rocket fire killed four Israeli soldiers nearby. However the aid agency Unruha says no aid has yet
*07:50.580- 07:55.880* :  entered Gaza. Talks to try to reach a new deal on a ceasefire and the return of hostages
*07:55.880- 08:02.200* :  are continuing in Cairo with the US saying it believes a revised Hamas proposal could lead to a
*08:02.200- 08:07.020* :  breakthrough and the Israeli military has played down the significance of Washington halting
*08:07.020- 08:13.340* :  a shipment of powerful bombs saying its support in the war has been unprecedented. Yulanael
*08:14.360- 08:19.760* :  an appeals court in Hong Kong has banned a popular song written during the pro-democracy
*08:29.300- 08:35.420* :  protests of 2019. Well that is the song it's called Glory to Hong Kong and it includes
*08:35.420- 08:42.300* :  defiant lyrics including the key protest slogan liberate Hong Kong a revolution of our times.
*08:43.200- 08:47.060* :  After today's court ruled in the territories authorities have tried to have that song
*08:47.060- 08:51.700* :  removed from the internet. Our Asia Pacific editor Michael Bristow told me more.
*08:52.100- 08:57.280* :  This is the end of a legal case which began last year when the government in Hong Kong applied
*08:57.280- 09:05.280* :  for an injunction to have this song banned. Initially Judd refused to agree to that request.
*09:05.280- 09:10.940* :  The government has appealed and that appeal has decided that the government was correct all
*09:10.940- 09:18.540* :  along that they can have the song banned. In effect though it's already legal to listen to play
*09:18.540- 09:23.940* :  to disseminate this song in Hong Kong. It has been for a couple of years what the government has
*09:23.940- 09:29.700* :  done is used other laws and regulations in order to have it quashed so nobody can hear it. Just
*09:29.700- 09:36.740* :  for example last year they actually prosecuted a busker who was playing it so it already has been
*09:36.760- 09:41.600* :  banned but this one this legal ruling just kind of ties up the loose ends.
*09:42.220- 09:47.840* :  And if it was plays in public again now by a busker by a radio station what could happen?
*09:47.840- 09:52.120* :  Prosecution what kind of punishment? Yeah prosecution now I think the major
*09:53.200- 09:58.460* :  impact this particular ruling will have as you indicated there in your introduction will be that
*09:59.220- 10:03.640* :  although in Hong Kong it was difficult to hear the song already difficult it was still
*10:03.640- 10:09.280* :  available on the internet and so I think the authorities in Hong Kong wanted this ruling to give
*10:09.280- 10:16.780* :  them more legal back in order to force internet providers like Google to try to to get rid of this
*10:16.780- 10:21.520* :  song on the internet because there have been a number of really embarrassing incidents in which this
*10:22.000- 10:28.440* :  song has been played at international events instead of China's national anthem and organizers
*10:28.440- 10:33.920* :  of sometimes just pull the song off the internet mistakenly thinking it was the national anthem
*10:33.920- 10:40.400* :  of Hong Kong so I think the authorities were keen particular to stop that particular avenue
*10:40.400- 10:46.460* :  for the song but it gives you an indication really of just how far Hong Kong has changed how much
*10:46.460- 10:51.800* :  the authorities have appeared to do in order to stop what many people would be considered a
*10:51.800- 10:56.540* :  pre-speech because in effect what they have done is just done the piece of music.
*10:57.280- 11:04.080* :  Mickey Bristol parents of children with potentially life threatening milk and peanut allergies say
*11:04.080- 11:09.200* :  their lives have been transformed by a three-year-old trial led by researchers in the UK.
*11:09.200- 11:15.440* :  It found that children's immune systems can be trained to cope with small amounts of the allergen
*11:15.840- 11:21.280* :  if they were given tiny daily doses it's hoped that eventually this method may be able to replace
*11:21.280- 11:26.700* :  pharmaceutical supplements that are normally used to treat food allergies. Doctors say they are
*11:26.700- 11:31.800* :  already seeing children able to consume and tolerate the very foods which previously would have
*11:31.800- 11:36.940* :  triggered a severe allergic reaction. Eleven-year-old Thomas has been taking part in the study.
*11:37.580- 11:44.020* :  It's changed my life. It's been managing my allergy and building my tolerance up to the best I can.
*11:44.220- 11:48.380* :  I've been taking six peanut and menends. Here's Thomas's mother Lauren.
*11:49.520- 11:54.080* :  It's brought down our anxiety levels around food and knowing that Thomas can now tolerate six
*11:54.180- 11:59.540* :  peanuts a day has taken away some of that worry and hopefully mean that he'll be able to eat a wider
*11:59.540- 12:05.260* :  variety of food as we won't be so concerned around access into exposure and the anxiety around
*12:05.260- 12:11.540* :  Thomas going to parties, sleepovers. When he's not with us this is really really helped to reduce
*12:11.620- 12:17.240* :  that and to do this without any medicine just off the shelf products is truly amazing.
*12:18.060- 12:22.440* :  Children as young as two were amongst the participants in the trial which was funded by
*12:22.440- 12:28.560* :  the Natasha Foundation set up by the parents of a 15-year-old girl who died after eating a sandwich
*12:28.560- 12:35.680* :  which contained sesame seed to which she had an allergy. Hassan Asshad is a professor of allergy
*12:35.680- 12:41.100* :  and clinical immunology at the University of Southampton in the UK. He told Johnny Diamond more
*12:41.100- 12:47.860* :  about the study. We assess how much a child can tolerate which is generally very very small amount
*12:47.860- 12:54.820* :  like 10 milligram and then we built it up gradually increasing the dose or a period of six to eight
*12:55.240- 13:04.420* :  months until they can tolerate a maximum dose which is as Thomas said around five to six peanut
*13:04.420- 13:11.540* :  M&Ms which gives them sufficient tolerance to go around and eat freely. This doesn't cure the
*13:11.540- 13:18.400* :  allergy. I mean people are still allergic to things but it enables them to live with it. Is that
*13:18.400- 13:26.500* :  a fair summary? To some extent there are varying degrees of responses in individual so some people
*13:26.500- 13:33.580* :  can tolerate the maximum amount or rather unlimited and others do start to react at some stage
*13:33.580- 13:41.620* :  where we stop. Essentially in about 80 to 90 percent of children giving this treatment they
*13:41.620- 13:49.720* :  are able to tolerate sufficient food that allows them to basically eat freely and do not have
*13:49.720- 13:56.580* :  the worry of these accidental exposure and reactions which is what they have previously lived
*13:56.780- 14:04.320* :  with. 80 to 90 percent seems like an astonishing success rate. Exactly. This treatment has been found
*14:04.320- 14:12.600* :  to be extremely effective if given in the way that we have designed the protocol and importantly
*14:12.600- 14:19.400* :  it needs to be safe because these children have been previously reacting to the food and doing this
*14:19.760- 14:27.160* :  does have some risk associated with it and therefore we have designed program with scientists who
*14:27.160- 14:35.280* :  have been doing this before to develop this as a safe and also effective. It's worth doing a quick
*14:35.280- 14:43.140* :  don't try this at home warning isn't it? Exactly yes. At the end of this project we hope to develop
*14:43.140- 14:49.160* :  detailed guidance is how this can be done under medical supervision in future and the program can
*14:49.160- 14:56.980* :  be rolled out. Professor Hassan Ahshad from the University of Southampton in the UK still to come
*14:57.160- 15:03.060* :  Russia's last Eurovision contestant says that despite the threat to her safety she'll continue
*15:03.060- 15:10.340* :  to call for peace in Ukraine. I believe that with music it's a little bit easier to go through this
*15:10.660- 15:14.580* :  pain to go through this path of life with the warm heart.
*15:25.400- 15:27.900* :  Now to the Serbian capital Belgrade.
*15:33.880- 15:39.960* :  Where the Chinese president Xi Jinping was met by dancers and musicians in traditional costumes
*15:39.960- 15:46.380* :  at the start of the latest leg of his European tour. His visit to the Balkan country comes 25 years
*15:46.380- 15:52.360* :  since NATO bombed the Chinese embassy there during its campaign to try to force the then Yuga
*15:52.360- 15:59.060* :  Slav forces to withdraw from Kosovo. NATO said that was an accident but it damaged US Chinese
*15:59.060- 16:04.800* :  relations for years. I asked our Balkan correspondent Guida Lorney who's in Belgrade why this visit
*16:04.800- 16:10.320* :  is so important to Serbia and China. The thing to China gives us an opportunity to have this
*16:10.320- 16:16.400* :  platform to criticize NATO because if you want a sympathetic audience when you criticising NATO
*16:16.400- 16:21.860* :  will Serbia is a very good place to come. Belgrade was bombed in that 1999 campaign. That's where
*16:21.860- 16:27.820* :  many other places in Serbia and Montenegro and I think support here for Serbia. Joining NATO,
*16:27.820- 16:32.920* :  as most of its neighbours have done, is somewhere in the low single figures. So that's an obvious
*16:32.920- 16:38.300* :  thing for China to do. In terms of what we're looking at here with China and Serbia, the two
*16:38.300- 16:44.080* :  presidents meeting, it's also a very strong signal that Serbia while it's deep in EU accession
*16:44.080- 16:49.540* :  negotiations sees those talks dragging out interminably and it's sending a message to Brussels saying
*16:49.540- 16:56.200* :  look we've got other friends and they're quite powerful as well. And guy that 25 year anniversary,
*16:56.200- 17:04.980* :  how is it going to be marked? Well we were wondering whether Mr Xi might go to what is now called
*17:04.980- 17:10.800* :  the China Cultural Centre which is a new building established on the site of the embassy and that's
*17:11.140- 17:16.720* :  having its official opening. Now we haven't seen him go there yet and he's got a fairly compact
*17:16.720- 17:23.540* :  itinerary so he may not arrive. Nonetheless there's that memorial outside the China Cultural Centre
*17:23.880- 17:29.200* :  and Mr Xi has marked the anniversary by writing an editorial in one of Serbia's biggest newspapers
*17:29.200- 17:34.220* :  saying that China will never forget and that while Chinese people cherish peace they will never
*17:34.220- 17:41.160* :  allow such tragic history to be repeated. So after this visit to Serbia, President Xi goes on to
*17:41.160- 17:48.040* :  Hungary I suppose no surprise there because he's going to get a similarly welcome reaction there
*17:48.040- 17:53.460* :  isn't it? Well indeed China is the biggest investor in Hungary, BYD the Chinese electric car
*17:53.460- 17:58.720* :  company is about to open a factory there and of course Budapest is at the other end of the Belgrade
*17:58.720- 18:04.040* :  Budapest Railway which is being built with Chinese finance and Chinese engineering expertise
*18:04.460- 18:10.220* :  so all in all it fits very nicely indeed for President Xi Jinping not just sending a message
*18:11.120- 18:17.060* :  that aspirant EU members want to have strong relations with China but the current EU member states do
*18:17.060- 18:24.360* :  as well. Guida Lorne in Belgrade. A senior member of Germany's intelligence agencies says the far
*18:24.360- 18:31.500* :  right alternative for Deutschland party poses a risk to democracy. The AFD which has strong support
*18:31.500- 18:37.060* :  in eastern Germany rejects accusations of extremism but the BBC has found clear links between
*18:37.060- 18:43.940* :  significant party figures and extremist or even former neo-Nazi networks. More details from our
*18:43.940- 18:55.460* :  Berlin correspondent Jessica Parker. On a Sunday morning the church bells rang on longer than
*18:55.460- 19:03.280* :  usual in the city of Kotbus. Alternative for Deutschland activists who'd set up a stage right by
*19:03.280- 19:09.760* :  the church suspected the local priest of trying to interrupt their rally. But the speeches do get
*19:09.760- 19:16.500* :  going including by 27-year-old Jean Pascal-Homme a regional parliamentary candidate for the far
*19:16.500- 19:27.280* :  right AFD. Let us the BBC have found he's held links with several groups now classed by domestic
*19:27.280- 19:34.040* :  intelligence as extremist networks accused of anti-migrant anti-Muslim ideology.
*19:36.320- 19:41.580* :  All these organizations focus on one subject which is the main theme of our times. It is the
*19:41.580- 19:47.120* :  population replacement going on a Germany end in Europe to voice that and to fight that politically
*19:47.120- 19:52.220* :  as not extremist. It means defending the right to our homeland as Germans and Europeans.
*19:54.000- 19:59.880* :  I'm on a quiet street in the city of Kotbus and I'm looking across at a local office and it's
*19:59.880- 20:06.100* :  in that building that Jean Pascal-Homme helped organise a meeting in March that we've been looking
*20:06.100- 20:13.620* :  into. The speaker was an MP called Matthias Helferick who once described himself as the friendly
*20:13.620- 20:21.780* :  face of national socialism, Nazism. The old leaked Facebook messages says Matthias Helferick was
*20:21.780- 20:26.980* :  satire, but they led to him not being able to join the AFD's parliamentary faction.
*20:30.420- 20:37.780* :  This talk in Kotbus was on remigration, a term widely regarded as a euphemism for mass deportations.
*20:37.840- 20:42.600* :  In a video here, Mr Helferick talks about preserving the land of the Germans
*20:43.140- 20:47.680* :  and remigrating people from Africa and the Middle East in their millions.
*20:51.620- 20:56.920* :  Why does this matter? Well, first of all, the AFD is hoping to do well in European parliamentary
*20:56.920- 21:03.280* :  and regional German elections this year and these men who we discovered were all at this one meeting
*21:03.280- 21:09.060* :  back in March aren't the only examples of alleged extremism in the party. What's more,
*21:09.060- 21:15.140* :  particularly within the more radical wing of the AFD? These guys aren't nobody's, they have
*21:15.140- 21:20.300* :  influence. I've met with a domestic intelligence chief in the eastern state of Theringer.
*21:20.300- 21:26.180* :  Stefan Karmer, who's Jewish, says he'd leave Germany if the AFD gained power.
*21:26.660- 21:29.460* :  By your saying that, as the head of domestic intelligence here,
*21:30.380- 21:35.740* :  doesn't that feed into their narrative that the state is somehow biased against them, even
*21:35.740- 21:42.260* :  persecuting them? Look, this is not about bias, the AFD clearly states in the meantime a
*21:42.260- 21:50.060* :  focus nationalistic political point of view, turning Germany back into something that we've
*21:50.060- 22:00.240* :  probably only seen between 1933 and 45. The AFD claims it's being smeared by the establishment
*22:00.240- 22:06.260* :  as it works to drum up momentum at rallies and town hall events. Poling high in Germany's east
*22:06.560- 22:12.140* :  supporters even claim they're not extreme, but increasingly represent the center ground.
*22:15.720- 22:23.940* :  Jessica Parker reporting. Manija was once one of Russia's biggest pop stars. She's also the
*22:23.940- 22:29.180* :  last person to have represented the country at the Eurovision Song Contest back in 2021.
*22:30.060- 22:35.560* :  But when Russia invaded Ukraine, Manija decided to use her name and her platform to share her
*22:35.560- 22:42.120* :  anti-war views. From that moment, her concerts were cancelled, her songs were banned, and her safety
*22:42.120- 22:47.560* :  both in real life and online compromised. More than two years since the start of the war,
*22:47.880- 22:52.800* :  Manija is using her music to share a message of hope to those affected by the conflict.
*22:53.620- 23:01.580* :  I was a refugee before, but then became a big star in Russia. I did it by my own hands with
*23:01.580- 23:09.060* :  my mother. It was absolutely independent way without ending labels, without any supporters
*23:09.060- 23:15.440* :  with money. We did it to women together. I remember that morning when I saw all the news that
*23:15.440- 23:22.180* :  war started in Ukraine, and I had so many flashbacks in my head. It's horrible to be a refugee,
*23:22.180- 23:29.520* :  it's horrible to experience that in your life. When I said I want to see peace, I think it's a normal
*23:29.520- 23:37.700* :  thing to do. I know it's risky, and I'm risking a lot right now. I didn't lose my career,
*23:37.700- 23:43.520* :  my government is trying to destroy my career in my home. That's okay. I'm continuing my way. I'm
*23:43.520- 23:50.420* :  doing what I can. War is going on still, and there are so many women and kids. The only one thing
*23:50.420- 23:56.500* :  they want is to come back home, and they can't. I know that feeling, and I wanted to support all
*23:56.500- 24:02.300* :  those people. I wanted to show them that they are not alone, and we have to think about them,
*24:02.980- 24:09.660* :  because even if tomorrow the war will stop, I wish I rewant it. There still will be a lot of
*24:09.660- 24:17.060* :  refugees, and we have to be their supporter of their bright future. I am blacklisted right now,
*24:17.360- 24:23.960* :  like my music band in public places. Children and school cannot listen to my music. I cannot do
*24:24.700- 24:32.700* :  charity performances. I'm going through cyberbullying attacks. All of my media platforms,
*24:32.700- 24:41.200* :  social media platforms are attacked by bots. I'm going through right now under the investigation
*24:42.160- 24:50.160* :  from Russian investigative community. Sometimes I feel myself very weak and helpless, but
*24:51.220- 24:56.660* :  at the same time, I understand that, first of all, I'm not alone. I have my family and I have my
*24:56.660- 25:05.460* :  daughter, which means that I have to continue my way. I don't want to look like victim. I'm still
*25:05.460- 25:13.580* :  a human, and I'm singing, and I'm a woman, and I can do what I love to do. I'm writing my songs
*25:13.580- 25:21.180* :  to give people hope. I believe that with music, it's a little bit easier to go through this pain,
*25:21.180- 25:27.260* :  to go through this path of life with the warm heart. That was the singer, Manija.
*25:28.980- 25:33.500* :  How can a group of closely related birds be regarded simultaneously as unlucky
*25:33.500- 25:39.360* :  the protection from evil and ally to the farmer are pest to be eliminated with a catapult,
*25:39.800- 25:45.660* :  an endangered species worth preserving, and a symbol of wisdom and a bird worth eating?
*25:46.160- 25:52.860* :  Well, that is the fate of Nepal's 23 owl species. There's a wide range of threats to Nepal's
*25:52.860- 25:59.820* :  owls. 1500 of them are hunted or traded elitately every year, but one man is trying to protect them all.
*25:59.820- 26:06.560* :  He's called a Raju Acharya. He's just received an award from the Wittley Fund for Nature. That's a
*26:06.560- 26:12.080* :  UK charity helping conservationists in the global south. So David Attenborough, a veteran
*26:12.080- 26:18.920* :  nature broadcaster, is one of its supporters. Nepal is famous for its breathtaking landscapes,
*26:19.020- 26:26.260* :  from the tallest snowpeak mountains to its lush green forests. But as the sun goes down,
*26:26.660- 26:32.740* :  a whole other world is revealed, along with a group of birds that has kept the heart of one man.
*26:32.880- 26:39.000* :  Raju is the prince. The conservation gives even the smallest communities the power to influence
*26:39.000- 26:47.420* :  how a whole nation protects its biodiversity. Sean Lay asked Raju Acharya about the challenge
*26:47.420- 26:54.500* :  to conservation posed by the owls ambiguous status in Nepal. In Nepal, the owl are not considered
*26:54.500- 26:59.760* :  as good bird, but our lifestyle is totally dependent on the subsistence agriculture.
*27:00.980- 27:07.640* :  And these owls, they regulate the rodent population. That's why they help the farmer. So this is
*27:07.640- 27:14.120* :  one of the major benefits. That's why this bird is also called as farmer's friend. So it's a farmer's
*27:14.120- 27:19.280* :  friend because it does good work on the land. Can you explain a bit more about how the owl helps the
*27:19.280- 27:27.760* :  farmer? A single family of owls, like a barn owl, which is also common here as well. So they eat
*27:27.760- 27:35.800* :  around 2000 rodent in one season. So you can just imagine how much they are helping to farmer.
*27:36.320- 27:42.300* :  That's why in many countries, the government is trying to provide the artificialness so that
*27:42.300- 27:47.100* :  lots of owl can come and they control the rodent population even in England, in South Africa.
*27:47.840- 27:54.180* :  But we don't have such programs. So they actually help farmers to get more agriculture crop.
*27:54.600- 28:01.320* :  And yet in Nepal, they're not necessarily regarded as a beneficial bird. A lot of people see them as a
*28:01.320- 28:09.360* :  pest. We have around 125 ethnic group and languages. So it is very hard to generalize the
*28:09.840- 28:15.660* :  people's perception. But in general, the people they don't like owl and they symbolize
*28:16.300- 28:22.720* :  owl has a very lazy and dumb creature. So they are not considered very good, but it depends.
*28:23.460- 28:28.860* :  If we go a little bit up in the high land, then people believe that their
*28:28.860- 28:36.720* :  body parts are worked as a protector. So they keep the feather of the owl in the main entrance and
*28:36.720- 28:42.220* :  they believe that the ghost and evil never go inside the home. The house is protected. So it
*28:42.220- 28:50.280* :  depends. Your work, and this is partly why you won this prize, is because this charity encourages
*28:50.280- 28:56.100* :  conservation that works with communities and tries to change perceptions in communities.
*28:56.680- 29:03.640* :  How hard has that been to do? It's very difficult because the landscape of Nepal is so hard to
*29:03.640- 29:10.240* :  reach from one place to another place. Even I had already visited many areas. But it's very
*29:10.240- 29:17.740* :  difficult and the people have such kind of perception since long years. They grown up with these
*29:17.740- 29:22.760* :  things. They grown up with the same perception. So it's very hard. So we try to teach them
*29:23.300- 29:29.580* :  the importance of owl. We try to teach them some people in Nepal, they regarded owl as an
*29:29.580- 29:35.340* :  envoy of the goddess Lakshmi, which is the god of wealth. So we just share the information.
*29:35.340- 29:40.640* :  If you kill the owl, it means you are killing the god. So in this way, we try to find out some
*29:40.640- 29:46.280* :  very critical points. Yes. And we share those points. So you're tailoring your message according
*29:46.280- 29:51.660* :  to your audience. Yeah. Yeah. It depends on the audience. I wonder where your personal love of
*29:51.820- 29:56.300* :  owls comes from. Is it something from your childhood? Is it something that's developed as you've
*29:56.300- 30:01.720* :  developed your interest in conservation? When did you fall in love with owls? One day I was walking
*30:01.720- 30:06.620* :  in the village and I found in the village, some people, some young people, they were doing
*30:06.620- 30:14.460* :  open barbecue of Strasbourg. And when I asked them and they said, it's an owl. It's for just a
*30:14.460- 30:21.020* :  supporting material for the alcohol, you know. So at that time, I was just blown away because I
*30:21.020- 30:27.080* :  didn't expect it. People also healed the owl and healed the owl. That was my training point.
*30:27.080- 30:32.880* :  And I thought that let's start something otherwise, it will be very late for the conservation.
*30:33.580- 30:40.600* :  I was to graduate Acharya, the winner of the 2024 Wittley award for his owl conservation efforts.
*30:40.600- 30:47.340* :  And before him, you also heard from David Attenborough, 98 years old today and still fighting for
*30:47.340- 30:53.120* :  the protection of the natural world. And before we go, the Olympic torch has arrived in France.
*30:53.120- 30:59.380* :  The flame traveled in style as it sailed into the port town of Marseille on a 19th century ship.
*30:59.380- 31:05.160* :  It arrived to the claps and cheers of sports fans ready to welcome the iconic Olympic flame.
*31:05.160- 31:14.220* :  Well, it now begins its epic journey across France taking in some vineyards in the
*31:14.220- 31:20.320* :  Loire on the way and the world famous Lascaux caves with their prehistoric paintings. It'll then
*31:20.320- 31:25.400* :  head overseas again to six of France's overseas territories, including Guadeloupe and the Caribbean,
*31:25.960- 31:31.680* :  and French Polynesia in the Pacific. It will ultimately make it its way back to the host city
*31:31.680- 31:35.940* :  Paris, where the game's a due to start on July the 26th.
*31:38.300- 31:42.540* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
