*01:44.620- 01:51.740* :  Sweden despite large protests against Israel's participation. Ukraine's President Zelensky has
*01:51.740- 01:57.200* :  sacked the head of the guards responsible for his personal protection after an alleged assassination plot.
*01:59.860- 02:04.940* :  Also in this podcast, China's economy has been slowed bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic,
*02:04.940- 02:08.420* :  but despite the gloom, one sector is improving.
*02:14.360- 02:19.360* :  Business is going well and it will only get better. Domestic tourism.
*02:24.520- 02:30.960* :  We will stand alone and fight with our fingernails. The defiant words of the Israeli Prime Minister
*02:30.960- 02:36.340* :  Benjamin Netanyahu after President Biden said the US would stop shipments of certain weapons
*02:36.340- 02:41.340* :  if Israel presses a head with a full-scale attack on Raffa in the south of Gaza,
*02:41.920- 02:45.260* :  where more than a million displaced Palestinians have sought refuge.
*02:45.980- 02:51.000* :  For weeks now, America has said such an assault would lead to many more civilian deaths,
*02:51.000- 02:58.080* :  but Israel is adamant and attack is the only way to destroy Hamas and secure the release of
*02:58.080- 03:02.540* :  more than a hundred hostages. Mr Netanyahu released this video statement.
*03:06.540- 03:11.560* :  We are determined and we are united towards defeating our enemies and those who seek to
*03:11.560- 03:18.740* :  harm us. If we ought to stand alone, we shall. I already told you we shall fight with our fingernails,
*03:19.220- 03:24.640* :  but we have much more than fingernails and with the same mental strength with God's help
*03:24.640- 03:30.500* :  together we will win. While the relationship between America and Israel is suffering one of its
*03:30.500- 03:35.540* :  most significant ruptures for a generation, people in Raffa are continuing to flee,
*03:35.920- 03:40.540* :  as Israeli tanks move close to built-up areas and the Israeli bombardment continues.
*03:41.300- 03:47.420* :  The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees says 80,000 people have left the area since Monday
*03:47.940- 03:52.560* :  when Israel warned Palestinians to evacuate. I got more on that with our security
*03:52.560- 03:57.820* :  correspondent Frank Gardner who's in Jerusalem, but first he told me about the Israeli response
*03:57.820- 04:03.340* :  to President Biden's announcement. A lot of people in Israel right across the political spectrum
*04:03.340- 04:11.660* :  are really stung and shocked by this. Not since 1982 has the U.S., Israel's closest benefactor,
*04:12.380- 04:17.120* :  withheld weapons or threatened to withhold weapons and at the moment the U.S. is doing both.
*04:17.120- 04:23.160* :  It's paused the delivery of some of the mist, lethal weaponry in its supply chain, the 2,000-pound
*04:23.160- 04:31.420* :  bomb that's 906 kilos because a weapon like that if dropped on a precise target is going to
*04:31.420- 04:37.100* :  crush the lungs of somebody 300 meters away with a pressure wave, you just can't use that sort of
*04:37.100- 04:43.220* :  weapon safely in a built-up area as overcrowded, as overcrowded, as Raffa. That's why the U.S.
*04:43.220- 04:50.880* :  is withheld it. So Mr Netanyahu's video message is really a reaction to this. It's an unrealistic
*04:50.980- 04:56.220* :  and rather sort of grand, eloquent speech saying it necessary. We'll do it alone. We fought
*04:56.640- 05:01.800* :  on our own with an arms embargo and our war of independence 76 years ago. These are different times
*05:01.800- 05:08.380* :  and there is no possible way that Israel could survive with all the enemies it's got without U.S.
*05:08.380- 05:13.200* :  weaponry. It could survive without British weaponry because it's tiny, but the U.S.
*05:13.200- 05:19.840* :  sends billions of dollars of weapons. Now, I think there is a difference between the U.S.
*05:19.840- 05:25.360* :  attitude to defending Israel against threats like Iran or Hasbulla, external enemies like that
*05:25.940- 05:31.640* :  and the way it's behaving in Gaza where the U.S. is deeply disapproving of the conduct of the
*05:31.640- 05:37.160* :  war there and it's got real concerns that the laws of war could well have been broken in the
*05:37.160- 05:43.800* :  conduct of the war there. So does it look to you like Israel is going ahead with an all-out assault
*05:43.820- 05:50.560* :  on Raffa? It's certainly showing signs of expanding and intensifying its operation there. What
*05:50.560- 05:56.340* :  began as a very limited operation in eastern Raffa proceeded by the dropping of leaflets to 100,000
*05:56.340- 06:01.980* :  people to move and as we've just heard there most of them did, but there are reports now coming
*06:01.980- 06:07.840* :  of shell fire and artillery strikes as strikes in other parts of Raffa and people have been
*06:07.840- 06:14.740* :  coming to hospitals reporting injuries from there. So there's no question Hamas is there. Israel
*06:14.740- 06:19.440* :  has convinced that it's got four remaining battalions above and below ground and quite possibly
*06:19.440- 06:26.200* :  Yahya Sinwa, the architect of the october the 7th massacre is there, but this is going to cause
*06:26.200- 06:31.440* :  a lot of civilian casualties if it gets bigger and that's the U.S. fear. Frank Gardner in Jerusalem,
*06:32.040- 06:37.700* :  to the Swedish city of Malmo now where the Eurovision Song Contest is taking place. The second
*06:37.700- 06:44.060* :  semi-final was held on Thursday evening. Israel's entry was performed by Edangolan and it was
*06:44.060- 06:50.080* :  among those that qualified for the final on Saturday. This despite thousands of people taking part
*06:50.080- 06:55.340* :  in pro-Palestinian protests on the streets against Israel's participation in the contest.
*06:55.340- 07:00.160* :  The environmental protester Greta Tumberg was among the crowds that gathered in the city's
*07:00.160- 07:06.160* :  main square, waving flags and chanting and Edangolan was also booed during her performance.
*07:06.200- 07:14.020* :  These protestors share their feelings. I do like Eurovision. My children are listening to Eurovision
*07:14.080- 07:22.960* :  and they are living in ignorance and happy about Eurovision and I would like it to be so that the
*07:22.960- 07:29.380* :  music will unite people and we all love music but this year music is dividing people and I don't
*07:29.380- 07:34.720* :  like that. Putting on a show like Eurovision is just just feels wrong when this is happening so
*07:35.680- 07:41.900* :  I'm showing my support from Palestine and I hope that the countries and the leading people of
*07:41.900- 07:48.080* :  the countries will react in some way. That's my whole. Eurovision is normally known for fun,
*07:48.080- 07:53.820* :  sequins and silliness. I asked our reporter Charlotte Gallagher who's in Malmo if a controversy
*07:53.820- 07:59.480* :  over Israel was overshadowing the contest. It is, I mean it doesn't really feel like a normal
*07:59.480- 08:06.180* :  Eurovision song contest in many ways. Normally Eurovision is about songs and sequins and
*08:06.640- 08:12.280* :  incredible performances but when you're in Malmo you don't really feel like there's this massive
*08:12.280- 08:18.380* :  musical party going on. There are hundreds of police visible in police uniforms and then there's
*08:18.380- 08:23.320* :  also lots of other plain colloved police officers walking around but you can tell the police
*08:23.340- 08:28.480* :  because they're wearing earpieces and there was a huge protest today as you've heard in the
*08:28.480- 08:34.060* :  centre of Malmo so it does feel incredibly strange like even when we arrived and we went to our
*08:34.060- 08:39.600* :  hotel before we could enter the building we were asked to show that we definitely had a booking
*08:39.600- 08:43.120* :  by armed police that were outside the hotel and we don't know if that's because someone is
*08:43.120- 08:48.740* :  staying there or whether you know just security procedures are so tight in Malmo it does seem
*08:49.540- 08:55.900* :  very odd and obviously this tense situation is going to continue. Now Israel have qualified and
*08:55.900- 09:01.940* :  they will be competing in the final on Saturday. So we could possibly see more protests on Saturday
*09:01.940- 09:08.780* :  but meanwhile tell us about some of the other acts tonight. There really was so much on display.
*09:08.780- 09:15.360* :  Nemo, the Swiss act who's incredibly popular, they got through, they've got a sort of operatic
*09:15.360- 09:19.720* :  act in many ways and they're kind of balancing almost on the head of a pin while they're dancing
*09:19.720- 09:26.020* :  around Austria, their rave song, got through Georgia, got through Latvia for the first time in a
*09:26.020- 09:31.460* :  long time, they've got through to the final so some real crowd leases are going through to the
*09:31.460- 09:36.580* :  final on Saturday. Lots of people really excited about Ireland in the final they're already through,
*09:36.580- 09:42.740* :  they've got Bambi Furg who describes herself as a witch and it's kind of weedy broad pot so
*09:42.740- 09:47.760* :  there really is kind of something for every taste you've got rock, you've got rave, you've got opera
*09:48.240- 09:53.860* :  and you've got this other kind of whole mix of traditional influences like Armenia for example
*09:53.860- 09:58.700* :  they're using quite traditional instruments and they're singing in Armenia as well so
*09:58.700- 10:04.520* :  there really is something for everyone. As usual your revision is bonkers I mean the finished
*10:04.520- 10:10.300* :  song for example you've got a guy dancing under thong as well so you've got really got a lot going on
*10:10.300- 10:16.940* :  on the night. Charlotte Gallagher in Malmo. Somalia's government has written to the UN Security Council
*10:16.940- 10:22.160* :  to say it no longer needs its political mission to the country and when its current mandate expires
*10:22.160- 10:28.020* :  in October it should not be renewed. Unsom as the UN mission is called has been in Somalia for more
*10:28.020- 10:33.420* :  than a decade helping the government to build a democracy. It's also overseen a force of peace
*10:33.420- 10:38.860* :  keepers from the African Union but now the government says it can go it alone which sounds like
*10:38.860- 10:45.320* :  a positive step but is it. Rebecca Kesby spoke to Matt Brydon, co-founder and strategic advisor
*10:45.320- 10:51.220* :  of Sahan Research Organization based in Nairobi. That's the way that both the federal government and
*10:51.220- 10:57.840* :  the United Nations are presenting it that it's a positive development meaning that Somalia no longer
*10:57.840- 11:04.700* :  needs a United Nations political mission. On the other hand the mandate of the political mission
*11:04.700- 11:10.480* :  has not yet been fulfilled which was to support Somalia with completing its constitution
*11:11.320- 11:18.260* :  setting up a federal system, electoral system for one person, one vote elections in about two
*11:18.260- 11:24.920* :  years time and none of that is ready so there are questions as to whether or not this decision
*11:24.920- 11:31.740* :  might be premature. So what is your understanding as to why they're doing this?
*11:33.020- 11:40.040* :  Somalia's federal government is feeling a very positive vibe at the moment. It has succeeded in
*11:40.040- 11:47.160* :  lifting a United Nations arms embargo at Somalia. It has exceeded to the East African community
*11:48.220- 11:53.780* :  and it has achieved a number of other milestones that relief with the International
*11:54.080- 11:59.400* :  Monetary Fund in the World Bank that look like Somalia's really on the road to recovery
*12:00.320- 12:06.860* :  internally on the other hand. There are serious challenges including the fact that about half of
*12:06.860- 12:13.240* :  Somalia's territory is beyond control of the federal government because the administrations
*12:13.240- 12:19.480* :  in those parts of the country don't accept the federal government's rule and what remains is largely
*12:19.480- 12:25.600* :  controlled by the extremist group al-Shabaab. I think it's still saying that it wants the peace
*12:25.600- 12:32.380* :  keepers which are from the African Union just talk us through that decision. The African Union
*12:32.800- 12:40.420* :  peace support mission in Somalia used to have about 22,000 troops and now it is at about 14,000
*12:41.240- 12:48.400* :  and it's supposed to draw down to just over 10,000 by the end of June. The problem is that the
*12:48.400- 12:53.220* :  federal government really doesn't control much beyond the capital mug de chue and its
*12:53.220- 12:59.800* :  environment so it has been relying on African Union troops to extend its authority to other parts of
*12:59.800- 13:07.360* :  the country. If the African Union draws down to 10,000 troops it will leave the capital mug de chue
*13:07.400- 13:14.780* :  and a number of other major centers exposed to al-Shabaab and there is a risk of the federal
*13:14.780- 13:20.260* :  government not only losing territory but actually coming under threat from al-Shabaab.
*13:20.600- 13:26.600* :  I mean is there a situation whereby the Security Council would refuse and say actually know
*13:26.600- 13:33.020* :  we think we need to stay longer? In theory Somalia's federal government is actually a provisional
*13:33.020- 13:40.280* :  or an interim government so in one sense it would be possible for the UN to say that a peace
*13:40.280- 13:46.560* :  support operation is required and mandated whether the government wants it or not but that doesn't
*13:46.560- 13:51.700* :  seem likely to happen the federal government is a certain sovereignty and the UN seems likely
*13:51.700- 13:58.120* :  to agree but if al-Shabaab were to approach mug de chue and to threaten the federal government
*13:58.120- 14:04.320* :  then this would be a problem for Somalia's neighbors and for the region and there's also a concern
*14:04.320- 14:09.100* :  on the part of Somalia's western partners that maybe it's time for the federal government to
*14:09.100- 14:15.060* :  negotiate with al-Shabaab in order to prevent a takeover. Matt Bryden from the Saharan Research
*14:15.060- 14:20.860* :  Organization based in Kenya. Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky has sacked the head of the
*14:20.860- 14:26.520* :  guards responsible for his personal protection so he ruled over an alleged assassination plot.
*14:27.220- 14:31.860* :  Two kernels who worked for so he ruled were arrested earlier this week accused of working for
*14:31.860- 14:37.960* :  Russia with the aim of killing Mr. Zelensky. Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse reports from
*14:37.960- 14:43.640* :  Kiev? The allegations the two kernels are facing are both lengthy and eye opening. They include
*14:43.640- 14:48.860* :  allegedly trying to find close protection officers for President Zelensky and other senior officials
*14:48.860- 14:54.360* :  who'd be willing to kidnap and kill them. It's claimed they were recruited by Moscow before
*14:54.360- 15:00.140* :  the full-scale invasion and were caught transporting weapons and explosives to Kiev for an attack.
*15:00.980- 15:06.100* :  If sir he ruled's job wasn't vulnerable enough another one of his officers that the state security
*15:06.100- 15:12.240* :  service has been charged with murder. James Waterhouse in Ukraine. There was once a belief that whatever
*15:12.240- 15:17.580* :  problems the global economy had you could always rely on China to give it a boost but Asia's
*15:17.580- 15:23.720* :  powerhouse hasn't bounced back from the coronavirus as expected. Despite the gloom though one bright
*15:23.720- 15:31.780* :  light has been China's domestic tourism market which has improved in a dramatic fashion. Some 295
*15:31.780- 15:38.660* :  million trips were made there last week during the five day made a break. That's up by more than
*15:38.660- 15:46.320* :  28% compared to 2019 and that was before the pandemic. However Beijing is concerned that international
*15:46.380- 15:51.560* :  travellers haven't returned to China in the same numbers as before and the government is now
*15:51.560- 15:57.120* :  introducing measures to woo back foreigners. Our China Correspondence Stephen Macdonald reports from
*15:57.120- 16:05.840* :  Mujan in the country's southeast. Walking down the stone streets of the historic river town Wu
*16:05.840- 16:15.760* :  Jain. You can see that tourism here is definitely back and given how slowly China has been recovering
*16:15.760- 16:21.960* :  from the COVID crisis this will be a welcome sight. While other parts of the Chinese economy have
*16:21.960- 16:28.100* :  been flat or even worse at least with tourism it's as if the energy has come back.
*16:29.860- 16:35.520* :  And this has been good news for the local storeholders. For example one man selling ice cream in the
*16:35.560- 16:43.200* :  streets. For its numbers lately and not too bad. Part of the numbers as good as before COVID.
*16:43.200- 16:50.280* :  Yian. Almost the same. Other shopkeepers echoed this positive sentiment. They asked the woman
*16:50.280- 16:57.140* :  selling traditional snacks how the business was going. Business is going well and it will only
*16:57.140- 17:03.280* :  get better. Chinese tourists like to dress up in traditional clothing when they visit in
*17:03.280- 17:10.400* :  June as if they'd been really transported back hundreds of years. Those we met said that post-COVID,
*17:10.400- 17:18.060* :  their friends and family rule embracing travel. Of course after the pandemic we are all visiting
*17:18.060- 17:24.380* :  other places. One thing to do with these days at China's historic sites is a lack of international
*17:24.480- 17:30.620* :  travelers. In years gone by you would have expected to see many faces from overseas in places like
*17:30.620- 17:38.000* :  this. Today we haven't seen many and the tourism industry here is asking itself why that might be.
*17:38.000- 17:44.360* :  We did find some international tourists to ask about this. For example a young woman from Russia
*17:44.360- 17:50.200* :  who's studying here but was visiting Woo-Jun with her mother who's here on holiday. It's actually
*17:50.200- 17:56.600* :  really difficult to have a credit card here especially for tourists or like for my mom.
*17:57.020- 18:00.940* :  So for foreigners who are based here it's okay but it becomes more difficult if you're visiting.
*18:00.940- 18:06.580* :  Is that right? Oh yeah yeah it is. Do you have any suggestions of what would make it more smooth
*18:06.580- 18:12.160* :  for tourists to come here? Actually I think China is still a little bit more of like not
*18:12.160- 18:17.920* :  to open it to foreigners I think so. China is a really good country and not only for visiting
*18:17.920- 18:24.780* :  also for living here or walking here for a long time but my friends and all this stuff they
*18:24.780- 18:31.400* :  actually are living China because in some things it's really inconvenient because Chinese are not
*18:31.400- 18:37.960* :  open for like to you. And you're young Italian couple who just arrived. Regarding the payments of
*18:37.960- 18:44.900* :  course it can be at the beginning a bit confusing let's say but I mean it's okay you have them.
*18:45.240- 18:50.200* :  But it's work smoothly signing up for the digital payments it all worked okay easily. For now
*18:50.200- 18:56.960* :  now it's easier than last year. And what would you say like if some you know foreigners who think
*18:56.960- 19:00.740* :  they might want to travel to China but they think oh it's all a hassle because I don't know how to
*19:00.740- 19:04.740* :  do all these payments and book tickets and stuff. What would you say to them? What kind of a man
*19:04.740- 19:10.460* :  to find a Chinese friend like we did to you. Yeah right. Yeah so makes it easier to have a Chinese
*19:10.460- 19:16.340* :  friend. Much better. Much easier. They said that in Italy there hasn't really been a major change
*19:16.340- 19:22.700* :  regarding say political stigma over Chinese human rights abuses or global tensions which would
*19:22.700- 19:28.160* :  prevent tourists from coming here. Adding that having regular cheaper air connections would be a
*19:28.160- 19:35.540* :  more important factor to consider. China has tried to entice more travelers by expanding the
*19:35.540- 19:41.660* :  number of countries which don't need visas and many more places allow short stays visa-free
*19:41.660- 19:48.000* :  for those who have onward plane tickets. Yet there remains a significant disparity in terms of
*19:48.000- 19:54.080* :  the domestic and international tourist numbers. In places like Wuljern though with little stone
*19:54.080- 20:00.240* :  bridges crisscross rivers as wooden boats very visitors up and down. The tourism companies hope
*20:00.720- 20:05.400* :  that incredible sites like this will eventually be too much for foreign travelers to resist
*20:06.100- 20:13.600* :  and that eventually they'll be back either way. That report by Stephen McDonald in China.
*20:16.300- 20:21.580* :  Still to come on the global news podcast the Italian military is being deployed to deal with a
*20:21.580- 20:27.280* :  growing problem. There's a huge population 2.3 million all over the country. There have been
*20:27.280- 20:32.800* :  reports about them encroaching on territory in places like Rome where they come in and they're
*20:32.800- 20:36.300* :  going through the bins. Italy's wild boar population.

*21:49.360- 21:55.260* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The paranormal, a giant possum and adult movies,
*21:55.260- 22:00.260* :  just some of the subjects that came up in another colorful day in court for Donald Trump.
*22:00.260- 22:05.620* :  On Thursday was the second day of testimony in New York for the porn star Stormy Daniels.
*22:06.040- 22:10.560* :  She is a figure at the center of Mr. Trump's hush money trial which revolves around a six-figure
*22:10.560- 22:17.220* :  payment made to her before the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34
*22:17.220- 22:23.020* :  counts of falsifying business records to conceal the payment and denies any sexual encounter with
*22:23.020- 22:27.020* :  the adult film star. He spoke to reporters as he headed into court.
*22:41.060- 22:44.060* :  We don't want them to get carried away. There's no case.
*22:45.100- 22:48.720* :  But there is huge interest in this case, especially after the sometimes
*22:48.720- 22:54.720* :  salacious testimony Stormy Daniels gave on Tuesday. More than 200 members of the public had to be
*22:54.720- 23:00.020* :  turned away on Thursday because the courthouse was full. Nitorthic, our North America correspondent,
*23:00.020- 23:05.760* :  told us more. This was a real attempt by the defense to go after Stormy Daniels credibility
*23:05.980- 23:12.820* :  saying everything from the fact that she had apparently changed her story over time to her being
*23:12.820- 23:19.720* :  motivated by trying to profit off of Donald Trump a fake story as they put it and profit off of
*23:19.720- 23:26.080* :  his indictment. But look, it was a real battle of wits on the stand. Stormy Daniels replied with
*23:26.080- 23:33.220* :  kind of these witty, confident remarks using humor and dignation really hitting back. So for example,
*23:33.260- 23:40.280* :  she was asked about her experience making phony stories about sex appear real as her profession
*23:40.280- 23:45.900* :  in the adult film industry. And to that, she laughed and said the sex in the films was very much real
*23:45.900- 23:51.240* :  just like what happened to me in that room, a reference to that alleged sexual encounter with
*23:51.240- 23:56.600* :  Donald Trump, which he denies. And you know, for example, when she was asked about her posts on
*23:56.600- 24:01.580* :  social media and if she thought her story would be instrumental in putting Donald Trump in jail,
*24:02.080- 24:07.220* :  she replied, I don't see the word instrumental or jail. So she really wouldn't be kind of drawn
*24:07.220- 24:13.940* :  into a lot of the defense questioning and trying to discredit her. She really turned that around.
*24:13.940- 24:19.540* :  It'll be interesting to see how the jury has related to that. And it'll be also interesting to see
*24:19.540- 24:27.360* :  what impact this has on the American public. That's absolutely right. I mean, we saw on Tuesday such
*24:27.360- 24:34.680* :  very vivid, explicit details coming out about that alleged sexual encounter. And the defense
*24:34.680- 24:40.020* :  actually asked for a mistrial after that. Today, again, they say they're going to put another
*24:40.020- 24:45.380* :  motion for a mistrial that the judge said will be listened to at a hearing on Thursday.
*24:46.360- 24:53.000* :  But nevertheless, all of this really relates back to how the public and the jury view her story
*24:53.000- 24:58.240* :  if she came off as being authentic. And I can tell you from being inside the overflow room
*24:58.240- 25:04.420* :  watching Stormy Daniel's testimony, her tone, she had a very kind of confident body language.
*25:04.420- 25:12.340* :  She didn't really allow herself to be intimidated by the defense. So that's also part of the kind
*25:12.340- 25:18.420* :  of impression jurors will get from her testimony. Nidahsulfik, the co-founder of the law firm,
*25:18.420- 25:23.100* :  at the center of the Panama Papers tax scandal has died. Ramon Fonseca,
*25:23.100- 25:28.060* :  Mora, was 71 and had been suffering from ill health. Rory Galamore reports.
*25:28.060- 25:32.540* :  The Panama Papers was a leak of millions of financial documents eight years ago
*25:32.540- 25:37.060* :  that exposed how some of the world's richest and most powerful people hid their wealth.
*25:37.440- 25:41.800* :  At the heart of the revelations was a now defunct law firm, Mossack Fonseca.
*25:42.340- 25:47.140* :  Last month, nearly 30 of its employees went on trial in Panama facing money laundering charges.
*25:47.720- 25:53.380* :  Mr. Fonseca, who denied wrongdoing, was among them. But he didn't appear in court because he was
*25:53.380- 25:59.600* :  in hospital. A novelist as well as a lawyer, he set up the firm with Jürgen Mossack in the 1970s.
*25:59.880- 26:05.120* :  Mr. Fonseca once reportedly described the merger as the creation of a monster.
*26:05.960- 26:12.680* :  Rory Galamore. The Italian military is being deployed to Cull Wild Boar. There are more than a
*26:12.680- 26:17.340* :  million of them roaming freely across the country. And they've long been seen as a nuisance
*26:17.340- 26:23.320* :  snuffling through rubbish, rampaging through cultivated fields or even cornering terrified shoppers.
*26:23.800- 26:28.900* :  But now cases of swine fever have been found among the Boars. And the midfires that the disease
*26:28.900- 26:34.700* :  could spread to farmed pigs, some countries are restricting imports from Italy, which could have
*26:34.700- 26:40.600* :  serious consequences for its multi-billion dollar pork industry. Our Europe Regional Editor,
*26:40.800- 26:42.200* :  Nikki Cardwell, tell us more.
*27:10.140- 27:18.640* :  The cases of swine fever in Wild Boar in the Palmer region, which of course is synonymous with
*27:18.640- 27:25.240* :  Palmer Ham. And this is causing a problem for the industry. Now they export millions of
*27:25.260- 27:33.580* :  ham every year. With these countries, originally it was China, Japan, Korea saying there was a
*27:33.580- 27:37.720* :  problem and they weren't going to take imports. It's now Canada that said specifically from that
*27:37.720- 27:42.660* :  region that they won't take them and they're concerned about America, which is their biggest market.
*27:43.100- 27:48.420* :  But if you're talking about such a huge bore population, it's going to be a huge operation to
*27:48.420- 27:54.320* :  kill them. How are the army intending to do this? And it is only a small number of soldiers who are
*27:54.320- 27:59.040* :  actually going to go out there, but they will have the most up-to-date equipment. They're talking
*27:59.040- 28:06.240* :  about using drones and the army will have like night vision goggles. So this isn't going to be
*28:06.240- 28:11.520* :  like some kind of sport where sports huntsmen do have a hunting season out there for boars anyway.
*28:12.000- 28:16.140* :  They're going to have top equipment. Well, you say drones, you mean drones to spot them rather than
*28:16.140- 28:20.360* :  to spot them? Yes. So have drones that will detect heat patterns so they will be able to detect
*28:20.360- 28:25.800* :  where the populations are living. So they will have a fair idea. It won't be like they're just
*28:25.820- 28:29.800* :  going in and seeing what they can find. And what's the reaction been initially to all this?
*28:30.040- 28:34.100* :  There's been very little reaction. It's been a problem for a while and there's been a lot of
*28:34.100- 28:38.940* :  political conversations about it and a lot of promises that have never come through. They've tried
*28:38.940- 28:44.380* :  various tactics. They've tried putting up fences and they've tried protecting the bins and to
*28:44.420- 28:48.500* :  keep them away from the populace and it hasn't worked. There have been suggestions that the army
*28:48.500- 28:52.940* :  should be brought in for a while. It seems that now that the industry has threatened the government
*28:52.940- 28:58.860* :  is finally doing something. Nikki Cardwell. If you vape, you might want to listen closely.
*28:59.120- 29:04.180* :  Scientists researching liquids used in vaping have found that many of them contain chemicals,
*29:04.180- 29:11.120* :  which pose significant health risks when heated and inhaled. Numerous potentially toxic compounds
*29:11.120- 29:16.540* :  were found in 180 different vape flavors by scientists who employed artificial intelligence
*29:16.540- 29:22.080* :  to aid their research. Victoria Oonkunda spoke to the leader author of the report, Professor
*29:22.080- 29:26.520* :  Donald O'Shea, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, who told her more about the key
*29:27.100- 29:32.120* :  findings. What we have put together in this particular report is our work that describes the
*29:32.120- 29:38.960* :  artificial intelligence examination of all 180 flavors that are in vaping products that are
*29:38.960- 29:44.580* :  currently sold worldwide. And what we're seeing is that an alarming amount of breakdown products
*29:44.640- 29:51.280* :  can be made just before these chemicals are inhaled into the person's lungs. And because these
*29:51.280- 29:57.000* :  compounds are known, we can check in databases to see what their toxicities are held as it's how
*29:57.000- 30:02.260* :  warnings are. And that gives us an indication of what diseases may emerge in the vaping population,
*30:02.260- 30:08.340* :  maybe 10, 15 to 20 years from now. And what are those diseases that could eventually happen to
*30:08.340- 30:11.780* :  those who vape? I think most certainly we're looking at things like long damage,
*30:12.420- 30:18.540* :  cardiovascular diseases, and potentially cancers as well. Because these compounds have been
*30:18.540- 30:24.040* :  recognized to cause these health impacts already in different studies. But one will imagine a
*30:24.040- 30:29.700* :  thing that these kind of risks or health impact or implications could have been known before,
*30:29.700- 30:35.760* :  because we've had people smoking tobacco for years. I agree, yes, it seems strange that we seem
*30:35.760- 30:41.160* :  to be reliving this type of health issue that we should have learned more from the tobacco
*30:41.660- 30:47.160* :  crisis. And the length of time it took us to prove the health damages in terms of cancers and so
*30:47.160- 30:53.300* :  on, caused by tobacco, but we seem to not have remembered all of that. And we have to re-investigate
*30:53.300- 30:57.620* :  again and demonstrate that this is the case, but potentially for vaping as well. There are
*30:57.840- 31:02.240* :  differences from tobacco smoking because essentially these are chemical entities that are
*31:02.240- 31:07.940* :  human lungs have never really been widely exposed to before. So there may be differences as well,
*31:08.100- 31:13.720* :  not all this the same as tobacco. And I guess what we know intuitively is exposure to wide range
*31:13.720- 31:18.760* :  of chemicals, and the breakdown products in the lungs will lead to potentially diseases,
*31:19.620- 31:24.180* :  especially from long-term exposure. Professor Donald O'Shea from the Royal College of Surgeons
*31:24.180- 31:30.900* :  in Ireland. The tech giant apple is facing an online backlash over an ad for its new range of
*31:30.900- 31:36.760* :  iPads. The one-minute video shows a giant hydraulic press crushing books, musical instruments,
*31:36.760- 31:50.220* :  and other creative tools into oblivion. It was meant to illustrate how much apple has been
*31:50.220- 31:55.860* :  able to squeeze into its thinner tablet, but a host of artists have criticised the company for
*31:55.860- 32:02.120* :  what they call cultural insensitivity. The actor Hugh Grant accused the tech giant of destroying
*32:02.120- 32:07.400* :  the human experience. At the time of recording this podcast, Apple hadn't yet responded to
*32:07.400- 32:12.540* :  the negative feedback. Roger Hering spoke to Mark Bukowski, PR, and Clarice's consultant.
*32:12.600- 32:19.080* :  So what does he think of the advert? Well everybody is curious about Apple's advertising.
*32:19.220- 32:25.680* :  Whenever a new product is dawning, it comes complete frame by a great piece of advertising.
*32:25.680- 32:31.080* :  And historically, Apple have created some of the world's greatest advertising.
*32:31.080- 32:38.840* :  It's Apple Mac, original ad back in the day is heralded as one of the greatest of all times.
*32:39.440- 32:47.020* :  So when I saw this commercial take shape, my jaw dropped. I found it astonishing
*32:47.020- 32:53.980* :  that a brand that was absolutely so close to the cultural zeitgeist. Now moved into a place
*32:53.980- 33:01.320* :  which showed just how hebristic and how unattached they were to the very creative community
*33:01.500- 33:08.440* :  that they have been fueling for decades. So clearly a misstep. It's not something they calculated
*33:08.440- 33:12.660* :  and wanted to get some controversy. You reckon this is just a mistake? I think it's very poor
*33:12.660- 33:17.420* :  commercial. I think that they haven't taken account for the paranoia that exists with creative
*33:17.420- 33:23.600* :  community, particularly my AI at the moment. And the idea of crushing all this creativity
*33:23.600- 33:28.500* :  into a nice little flat iPad was probably thought to be a great little commercial.
*33:28.500- 33:33.300* :  Unfortunately they haven't put it into context. In a way they want to sell these things,
*33:33.300- 33:37.120* :  but they must want to sell them not just to their current community but more widely.
*33:37.120- 33:40.820* :  So in that sense, perhaps it does work as an awful lot more people are watching this
*33:41.220- 33:44.480* :  and thinking about it than what otherwise have done. I think people are now considering
*33:44.480- 33:49.220* :  the Apple brand. It is dealing with a number of court cases around the world at the moment
*33:49.260- 33:57.740* :  related to perhaps some of their actions in how they've grown. We look at the big titans
*33:57.740- 34:03.560* :  of the internet and Silicon Valley at the moment and we feel uncomfortable about the power
*34:03.560- 34:12.860* :  that they exert. And for a new iPad that is described as thinner than any other and lighter than
*34:12.860- 34:19.520* :  any other one then sort of skews down to that and said, is that all it can do? But I don't think
*34:19.520- 34:26.380* :  they want to create such controversy within the community that drives their cult like status.
*34:27.140- 34:30.700* :  Is this going to hurt them? No, I mean, it's going to hurt the bottom line or is it just a storm
*34:30.700- 34:33.980* :  in a teacup, do you think? Well, you think tend to be a storm in a teacup,
*34:34.220- 34:39.940* :  particularly if you've got social media pylons. If a brand doesn't learn from its mistakes and
*34:39.940- 34:44.100* :  carries on regardless. If they don't look at this and think, hang on a minute, you know,
*34:44.600- 34:49.640* :  let's look at the criticism. Let's analyse the criticism. Perhaps that's the mistake they'll make.
*34:49.640- 34:55.740* :  They're a big brand, but they've got a number of challenges that they face at the moment,
*34:55.740- 35:02.940* :  particularly around copyright, both in a number of products at the moment. And you know,
*35:02.940- 35:10.260* :  these things are a bit like water on stone and they will in road trust and people will begin to
*35:10.260- 35:16.600* :  think twice about it. I suspect that Apple will bounce back. This will be perceived to be a misstep
*35:16.600- 35:21.940* :  and I'm sure they'll move forward. Mark Bikowski, PR and Crisis Consultant.
*35:24.720- 35:28.460* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
