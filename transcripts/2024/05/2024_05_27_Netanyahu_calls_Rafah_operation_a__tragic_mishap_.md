*00:00.080- 00:03.300* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.240- 00:07.420* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*00:07.420- 00:10.960* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday, the 28th of May.
*00:10.960- 00:15.020* :  Israel's Prime Minister says the deaths of dozens of Palestinians in a fire
*00:15.020- 00:18.600* :  after an Israeli air strike was a tragic mishap.
*00:19.160- 00:23.280* :  A series of explosions has hit the Russian-held city of Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine.
*00:23.380- 00:28.660* :  And China bans a famous influencer from social media for boasting about his wealth.
*00:31.760- 00:32.460* :  Also in the podcast?
*00:33.160- 00:35.320* :  For me, it's difficult to say what's going on in the future,
*00:35.320- 00:41.400* :  to know probably have been a big percentage that I will not be back playing here in Roland Garros.
*00:42.200- 00:46.080* :  Here's the French-open tennis saying goodbye to one of its biggest stars.
*00:50.880- 00:55.040* :  Israel says it does everything it can to protect Palestinian civilians
*00:55.040- 00:59.800* :  as it tries to wipe out Hamas fighters in Gaza following the 7th of October massacre.
*01:00.400- 01:04.460* :  But on several occasions, the Israeli military has been forced to admit to mistakes,
*01:05.080- 01:07.260* :  airstrikes, which killed aid workers, for example,
*01:07.260- 01:10.260* :  or the shooting dead of Israeli hostages trying to escape.
*01:10.260- 01:14.280* :  Now, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Nassignyahu has said an operation
*01:14.280- 01:17.480* :  to target two Hamas leaders had gone badly wrong.
*01:19.540- 01:22.700* :  We have already evacuated and raffered about a million residents.
*01:22.700- 01:26.840* :  And despite our best effort, not to harm those uninvolved,
*01:27.140- 01:29.220* :  there was a tragic mishap last night.
*01:29.920- 01:31.480* :  We are investigating the incident.
*01:31.480- 01:35.100* :  We will draw conclusions because this is our policy.
*01:35.880- 01:39.820* :  For us, any uninvolved person who gets hurt, it's a tragedy.
*01:40.560- 01:43.560* :  For Hamas, it's a strategy. That's the difference.
*01:44.300- 01:48.200* :  Hamas, around health ministry in Gaza, said 45 people died
*01:48.200- 01:53.520* :  after the Israeli strike triggered a fire in a tent camp in the southern city of Raffa.
*01:53.820- 01:55.020* :  Many more were injured.
*01:55.800- 01:58.560* :  Nebel Fassak from the Palestinian Red Crescent
*01:58.560- 02:02.460* :  warned that some of the wounded would die as a result of a lack of hospital equipment.
*02:02.780- 02:07.340* :  We are extremely concerned that many of those who are injured
*02:07.860- 02:11.920* :  will still die because there isn't a surgical capacity left
*02:12.480- 02:14.360* :  to help all the people need.
*02:14.860- 02:18.760* :  And at the same time, there is no way to evacuate
*02:18.760- 02:23.240* :  those who are critically wounded to receive treatment overseas
*02:23.240- 02:28.160* :  because there are Fahvorder, which is the only way to get in or out of Gaza
*02:28.840- 02:30.020* :  remains closed.
*02:30.920- 02:34.180* :  Well, I'm at least correspondent Lucy Williamson told Alex Ritz
*02:34.180- 02:35.920* :  and more about the Israeli airstrike.
*02:36.460- 02:41.940* :  The Israeli army has also come forward and said that its target was
*02:41.940- 02:46.740* :  a top commander for Hamas in the occupied West Bank, Yasin Rabia,
*02:47.080- 02:51.140* :  and also a deputy of his who Israel says was hiding
*02:51.140- 02:57.360* :  amongst the displaced people, crowds of them that were packed into this sheltered area.
*02:57.980- 03:00.200* :  And the Israeli army has also been quick to come out
*03:00.240- 03:04.360* :  and say that it used precise munitions to target these men.
*03:04.360- 03:09.160* :  It used intelligence, it used aerial surveillance specifically to try and avoid
*03:09.800- 03:12.020* :  mass casualties and the killing of civilians.
*03:12.020- 03:14.960* :  But obviously something went very wrong
*03:14.960- 03:19.080* :  and the army has been pointing to the fires that appear to have started
*03:19.520- 03:21.420* :  in the wake of that airstrike.
*03:21.420- 03:25.320* :  It's not entirely clear what might have fueled the fires.
*03:25.320- 03:27.480* :  There was definitely a lot of flammable material around.
*03:27.480- 03:31.420* :  And some local reports have suggested there might even have been some kind of
*03:31.960- 03:34.240* :  fueling station very close by.
*03:34.700- 03:38.640* :  But anyway, an investigation has been launched by the Israeli army
*03:39.100- 03:40.240* :  and we're waiting on those results.
*03:40.680- 03:44.420* :  The international reaction, though, not terribly sympathetic to Israel's position.
*03:45.060- 03:48.900* :  No, there's been mounting international criticism of the way Israel has been
*03:49.840- 03:52.600* :  conducting this war, the US calling it heart breaking.
*03:52.600- 03:56.800* :  Again, urging Israel to take more precautions to protect civilians.
*03:56.800- 04:03.460* :  And this comes days after the UN's highest court ordered Israel to immediately
*04:03.460- 04:09.640* :  halt its military offensive in Raffa because of the potential impact on civilians.
*04:09.640- 04:14.760* :  But I mean, the Israeli Prime Minister has been fairly robust,
*04:14.940- 04:19.320* :  proud even of the way he stood up to that international pressure.
*04:19.320- 04:21.940* :  He was speaking to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset today,
*04:22.540- 04:27.380* :  and really reiterating just how he was the leader that could stand up against that pressure
*04:27.880- 04:28.900* :  and pursue the war.
*04:29.520- 04:34.200* :  Lucy, one other story, Egypt says a member of its security forces has been
*04:34.200- 04:39.900* :  killed in a shooting incident near the Raffa border between Egypt and Gaza.
*04:40.560- 04:41.600* :  What do we know about that?
*04:42.020- 04:46.740* :  The Israeli army, as you say, has said there has been a shooting incident
*04:46.900- 04:52.020* :  and it's conducting a review and investigation also being carried out on the Egyptian side.
*04:52.640- 04:58.480* :  We believe one Egyptian border guard appears to have been killed in that shooting incident.
*04:58.480- 05:01.220* :  But it's not entirely clear what happened.
*05:01.220- 05:06.320* :  What is clear is that tensions between Israel and Egypt have shot up in recent days.
*05:06.320- 05:11.320* :  Ever since Israel took control of the Palestinian, the Gaza side,
*05:11.320- 05:15.840* :  of the Raffa border crossing which has remained closed ever since.
*05:16.260- 05:20.340* :  And as I say, we're just waiting the outcome of the investigation to find out exactly what happened.
*05:20.840- 05:22.700* :  Lucy, Williamson in Jerusalem.
*05:23.700- 05:29.100* :  On Monday night, explosions were reported in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.
*05:29.100- 05:34.140* :  Social media channels shed photos and videos of flames lighting up the night sky.
*05:34.880- 05:40.320* :  Earlier, Russian attacks on the eastern city of Harkiv killed one civilian and injured ten others.
*05:41.100- 05:44.540* :  Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky, meanwhile, has been visiting Spain,
*05:44.540- 05:49.500* :  where he called on allies to use all possible means to pressurize Russia into peace.
*05:50.200- 05:52.200* :  This report from James Waterhouse in Kiev.
*05:52.680- 05:57.360* :  President Zelensky is trying to galvanize international momentum for peace on his terms.
*05:57.540- 06:01.880* :  That still includes the complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian soil.
*06:02.600- 06:06.340* :  At the moment, it's clear the Kremlin isn't going to be forced to do anything.
*06:06.940- 06:10.580* :  Its forces are claiming to have captured two villages in the east of the country
*06:10.580- 06:16.200* :  and are continuing to wage a major cross-border offensive in the north-eastern Harkiv region.
*06:16.820- 06:19.780* :  Kiev says it is in control after repelling ten attacks.
*06:19.780- 06:24.820* :  However, there are still growing calls, not least from the head of NATO in Stoltenberg,
*06:25.320- 06:30.460* :  for Western allies to allow Ukraine to use the missiles it provides on targets inside Russia.
*06:30.940- 06:33.880* :  A lot of the fighting is taking place in the Harkiv region,
*06:34.600- 06:38.140* :  where actually front line is very close to the border line.
*06:38.660- 06:41.860* :  And of course, if you cannot strike Russian forces on the Russian territory,
*06:42.600- 06:48.060* :  then they're not able to actually strike Russian forces which are attacking almost daily the Ukrainian forces.
*06:48.600- 06:51.280* :  That doesn't make NATO a part of the conflict,
*06:51.640- 06:54.320* :  but we are helping Ukraine to uphold the right for self-defense.
*06:54.800- 06:59.460* :  Currently, Ukraine only carries out cross-border strikes with drones it manufactures domestically.
*07:00.000- 07:04.260* :  The country's military intelligence agency claims to have carried out a drone strike last night,
*07:04.260- 07:09.360* :  more than 1,100 miles into Russia, a record distance since the war started.
*07:10.120- 07:13.400* :  Western weariness of this invasion escalating remains high,
*07:13.920- 07:18.260* :  so too are Moscow's ambitions, with it describing any potential peace deal
*07:18.260- 07:20.920* :  as having to affect the reality on the battlefield.
*07:21.480- 07:22.860* :  James Waters in Kiev
*07:23.800- 07:28.880* :  An influencer dubbed China's Kim Kardashian has been banned from Chinese social media
*07:29.480- 07:31.360* :  for bragging about his lavish lifestyle.
*07:31.920- 07:37.720* :  One hunt to end once claimed he would never go out in an outfit and jewelry worth less than $1.4 million.
*07:37.900- 07:43.580* :  He's one of three social media stars to a fallen foul of the communist authorities recently.
*07:43.980- 07:46.700* :  I heard more from our China media analyst, Carrie Allen.
*07:47.140- 07:51.100* :  One hunt trend had 4.3 million followers on Do-Yin,
*07:51.100- 07:52.540* :  which is China's version of TikTok,
*07:53.200- 07:56.660* :  and that's what made him quite similar to these other two figures as well.
*07:56.900- 08:01.340* :  They both had millions of followers by Gong-Zu and Ba-Yu Jia-Jie,
*08:01.800- 08:05.940* :  and what really made them similar is that they frequently showed off their luxury lifestyle,
*08:06.000- 08:10.180* :  so Wong in particular. His videos are quite similar to the TV show,
*08:10.580- 08:11.860* :  keeping up with the Kardashians.
*08:12.460- 08:15.900* :  It was very much a focus on his ostentatious apartment,
*08:15.900- 08:19.940* :  lots of expensive handbags and cosmetics dotted around,
*08:19.940- 08:23.380* :  and just kind of showing how wealthy people in China live.
*08:23.740- 08:25.480* :  His videos had a bit of a sense of humour,
*08:26.000- 08:29.720* :  but all three of these social media users platform accounts.
*08:29.720- 08:31.680* :  And now no longer able to view.
*08:31.680- 08:33.820* :  Instead, what happens if you try to access them?
*08:33.820- 08:37.120* :  You get a message saying that they've been suspended for violating regulations.
*08:37.880- 08:40.200* :  So is this a change in policy from the authorities
*08:40.200- 08:44.300* :  that it previously was all right to see wealthy individuals now?
*08:44.600- 08:45.560* :  They're not happy about it.
*08:45.920- 08:48.160* :  There's always been a certain amount of criticism.
*08:48.480- 08:53.400* :  Weibo did make a statement saying that it was committed to creating a civilised healthy
*08:53.400- 08:57.800* :  and harmonious environment. Weibo being China's equivalent of a platform like Facebook.
*08:57.900- 09:02.800* :  So it seems to suggest that it wants to avoid such content.
*09:02.800- 09:04.580* :  But over the last ten years,
*09:04.580- 09:08.860* :  it's been very common sometimes to see wealthy Chinese becoming very influential.
*09:08.900- 09:12.340* :  In fact, there was one Chinese individual, Wang Su Tsong,
*09:12.400- 09:15.440* :  who was the son of the then richest person in China.
*09:15.440- 09:17.380* :  And he was so influential.
*09:17.500- 09:19.120* :  He had tens of millions of followers.
*09:19.120- 09:23.300* :  And he'd often post videos of his dogs wearing gold apple watches
*09:23.300- 09:26.140* :  that he'd spent tens of thousands of dollars on.
*09:26.260- 09:28.700* :  So people have seen this kind of content before.
*09:28.700- 09:31.100* :  But we have to remember that China is a communist country.
*09:31.100- 09:35.860* :  And so the ideas of showing off extreme wealth are frowned upon by the authorities.
*09:36.200- 09:41.060* :  It is a communist country, but there was a time when it was okay to get rich in China.
*09:41.060- 09:45.660* :  But with the advent of Xi Jinping as president, that seems to have changed.
*09:46.220- 09:47.220* :  It does absolutely.
*09:47.220- 09:49.860* :  And particularly amongst young people since the pandemic,
*09:49.900- 09:54.200* :  it's been very difficult for young people to actually gain employment.
*09:54.200- 09:59.240* :  In fact, there are statistics suggesting that around one in five young Chinese
*09:59.240- 10:02.620* :  between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed.
*10:02.620- 10:04.760* :  And that's been the case for a number of years now.
*10:04.900- 10:07.720* :  It's very difficult for young Chinese to get a job.
*10:07.720- 10:12.500* :  And it's going to be increasingly difficult as a result of the now abolished one child policy.
*10:12.500- 10:15.780* :  You've got a much bigger, older demographic retiring.
*10:15.800- 10:18.460* :  And young people have to work much longer hours.
*10:18.700- 10:20.160* :  And they're not making much money.
*10:20.160- 10:23.520* :  And there is very much a light shone on China's wealthy,
*10:23.520- 10:27.280* :  saying that you at the same time have to show some social responsibility.
*10:27.360- 10:29.700* :  You have to help the country out at this difficult time.
*10:30.100- 10:33.440* :  Yeah, do you think these three influencers might be able to get back online
*10:33.440- 10:35.640* :  if they perhaps change what they post about?
*10:36.160- 10:36.880* :  I don't think so.
*10:37.140- 10:38.880* :  China has a very strong cancel culture.
*10:38.980- 10:40.600* :  So once you're gone, you're gone.
*10:40.600- 10:46.460* :  And there have been crackdowns in the past on influencers who have gained a lot of influence.
*10:46.660- 10:50.760* :  I mean, there was one internet celebrity back in 2021 called Via.
*10:51.340- 10:54.260* :  And she vanished from social media platforms at the time.
*10:54.260- 10:57.800* :  She was similarly dubbed the Kylie Jenner of China,
*10:57.800- 10:59.320* :  the Queen of Livestreaming.
*10:59.900- 11:01.500* :  And she's never made an appearance back.
*11:01.500- 11:04.640* :  Instead, what the country wants to do is promote young role models
*11:04.820- 11:06.640* :  that have strong work ethics.
*11:06.880- 11:09.880* :  So yeah, if these people have had one bad mark against them,
*11:09.940- 11:11.580* :  it's very unlikely that they'll come back.
*11:12.180- 11:14.000* :  Our China media analyst, Carrie Allen.
*11:14.840- 11:19.380* :  Now, he's dominated the red clay courts of Ronan Garros in Paris for two decades.
*11:20.020- 11:24.020* :  But has Rafael Nadal made his final appearance at the French Open tennis?
*11:24.840- 11:26.920* :  Alex Vereth has too much points.
*11:29.420- 11:33.540* :  To end, Rafael Nadal's French Open story as Nadal serves.
*11:33.540- 11:35.020* :  Backhand reply from Svereth.
*11:35.020- 11:36.700* :  The forehand from Nadal is long.
*11:38.320- 11:42.520* :  Rafael Nadal beaten in the first round of the French Open
*11:42.520- 11:46.720* :  a week before his 38th birthday by Alex Vereth
*11:47.340- 11:50.840* :  in a French Open in which he is strongly indicated
*11:50.840- 11:52.740* :  is likely to be his last.
*11:53.380- 11:57.880* :  Incredibly, it was only the fourth ever defeat in 116 matches
*11:57.900- 12:01.260* :  at the French Open for the 14-time champion there.
*12:01.700- 12:05.420* :  At the age of 37, Nadal is close to the end of his career
*12:05.420- 12:08.900* :  but he refused to confirm whether this was his farewell appearance.
*12:09.540- 12:11.700* :  For me, it's difficult to say what's going on in the future.
*12:11.900- 12:15.120* :  No, probably have been a big percentage
*12:15.120- 12:17.820* :  that I will not be back playing here in Roland Garros.
*12:18.320- 12:19.860* :  But I can say 100%.
*12:20.340- 12:23.240* :  Well, I had more about what could have been his final match
*12:23.240- 12:26.360* :  from our tennis correspondent and commentator, Russell Fuller.
*12:26.660- 12:30.840* :  Nadal was competitive for the most parts against Alex Vereth
*12:30.840- 12:33.080* :  who is the fourth best player in the world
*12:33.080- 12:34.120* :  according to the rankings.
*12:34.120- 12:38.840* :  One, the last big, clake-old event on the men's ATP Tour in Rome
*12:38.840- 12:41.060* :  just a week ago ahead of the French Open.
*12:41.800- 12:44.300* :  And in the second set and the third set in particular,
*12:44.300- 12:47.240* :  second set Nadal actually served for the set
*12:47.240- 12:48.860* :  to level the match at one set all
*12:48.900- 12:50.620* :  and early break up in the third.
*12:50.900- 12:54.560* :  But Vereth played very, very well and was just too good.
*12:54.940- 12:57.200* :  His level is just too good for Nadal at the moment.
*12:57.900- 13:00.340* :  He was virtually away from the tour for 15 months
*13:00.900- 13:01.960* :  because of a combination of injuries.
*13:02.900- 13:06.100* :  He turns 38 next Monday, but you could see the improvement
*13:06.100- 13:08.460* :  that he's made in the weeks that he has been back.
*13:08.900- 13:10.700* :  And that's why he's keeping his options open.
*13:11.180- 13:13.740* :  Yes, the Olympics here at Roland Garros
*13:13.900- 13:16.200* :  on the clay in late July, now the next priority.
*13:16.900- 13:20.820* :  That by then he's probably know whether his motivation,
*13:20.900- 13:23.820* :  his fitness and form is sufficient enough
*13:24.300- 13:25.900* :  to be able to continue his career,
*13:26.140- 13:30.720* :  possibly even into 2025, possibly even to one more French Open.
*13:31.240- 13:34.960* :  And you can see the esteem in which he's held by his fellow professionals
*13:34.960- 13:36.660* :  by the famous faces in the crowd.
*13:37.540- 13:40.840* :  Yes, believe me, it is very unusual for fellow professionals
*13:40.900- 13:43.160* :  to turn out and watch other players.
*13:43.160- 13:45.980* :  But for this match, Novak Djokovic was there,
*13:46.380- 13:48.160* :  the world number one in the women's game,
*13:48.160- 13:50.880* :  Eagish Fionteck and the defending champion here at Roland Garros,
*13:50.880- 13:53.280* :  who's always been a huge Raffa Nadal fan
*13:53.460- 13:54.860* :  and Carlos Alcarazza of Spain,
*13:54.900- 13:58.900* :  who I don't think left his seat for the entire four or three hours of the match.
*13:59.460- 14:04.740* :  So to see them part of a 15,000 crowd was very, very special.
*14:05.220- 14:09.280* :  Nadal didn't want a farewell ceremony after this match,
*14:09.280- 14:11.720* :  but he did agree to do an interview on court.
*14:11.720- 14:15.300* :  And that's where he just told the fans here that never say never.
*14:15.820- 14:17.040* :  I might just be back.
*14:17.480- 14:19.740* :  Our tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.
*14:20.420- 14:22.200* :  Now, how's this for a bargain?
*14:22.680- 14:26.200* :  Three years ago, a painting by the early 17th century Italian artist,
*14:26.200- 14:29.840* :  Caravaggio of Christ dripping blood beneath his crown of thorns
*14:30.440- 14:33.640* :  was put up for auction for just $1,600.
*14:33.900- 14:36.460* :  The reason it was priced so cheaply
*14:36.460- 14:40.440* :  is that it had been misattributed to a more minor artist.
*14:41.160- 14:44.320* :  Now, the correctly attributed and restored painting
*14:44.320- 14:46.920* :  will go and show at Madrid's Prado Museum.
*14:47.640- 14:49.480* :  Keith Christensen is a former curator
*14:49.480- 14:51.460* :  from the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
*14:51.940- 14:54.220* :  who's written about the painting for this exhibition.
*14:54.680- 14:56.500* :  Well, the painting is a lost Caravaggio,
*14:57.060- 14:59.120* :  but its first step was its appearance
*14:59.160- 15:02.440* :  at an auction house in Madrid in 2021.
*15:02.680- 15:06.800* :  Those who follow auctions, dealers, specialists,
*15:07.900- 15:10.740* :  somebody who thought this is not what it is purported to be,
*15:10.860- 15:13.660* :  which is a follower of Giuseppe de Rivera,
*15:13.660- 15:15.860* :  the prices unbelievably low.
*15:15.860- 15:18.400* :  This looks like a picture by Caravaggio.
*15:18.840- 15:20.180* :  Somebody put it on WhatsApp.
*15:20.180- 15:23.240* :  And after that, it's circulated like wildfire.
*15:23.480- 15:25.580* :  I think it must be one of the first pictures
*15:26.180- 15:28.480* :  that gained a complete consensus
*15:28.740- 15:30.880* :  or a near consensus from scholars
*15:30.880- 15:32.980* :  on the basis of WhatsApp images.
*15:33.500- 15:36.320* :  One of my colleagues who really is a marvelous specialist
*15:36.320- 15:38.540* :  in Caravaggio got on a plane
*15:38.540- 15:42.300* :  and actually saw the picture before it was removed from auction
*15:42.300- 15:44.860* :  because very quickly there was this feeling
*15:44.860- 15:47.500* :  that it was misattributed with a evaluation
*15:47.500- 15:51.020* :  that was ludicrous and that it had to be studied carefully.
*15:51.340- 15:52.140* :  So it was removed,
*15:52.140- 15:55.020* :  and the Prado instantly, of course, inspected it.
*15:55.260- 15:57.020* :  And pretty much put it on hold
*15:57.020- 16:00.500* :  so that everybody knew this was not going to get an export license.
*16:00.860- 16:01.780* :  Caravaggio himself,
*16:02.440- 16:05.260* :  Parfum is extraordinarily colorful life.
*16:05.360- 16:08.400* :  He did not leave a huge body of work, did he?
*16:09.000- 16:11.720* :  No, but ever since the exhibition held in Milan
*16:11.720- 16:15.520* :  in 1951, which put Caravaggio for the first time
*16:15.520- 16:16.720* :  before the public's eye,
*16:16.900- 16:19.900* :  laid the groundwork for him becoming the superstar he is today.
*16:20.100- 16:22.520* :  But the fact that there are different opinions about the dating
*16:22.520- 16:25.100* :  of this picture was it painted in the last years he was in Rome?
*16:25.140- 16:27.440* :  Was it painted in the first years in Naples
*16:27.440- 16:31.120* :  after he fled Rome for having killed someone in a tennis match?
*16:31.120- 16:34.000* :  Or was it painted in the very last year of his life
*16:34.000- 16:35.760* :  when he had returned to Naples?
*16:36.380- 16:38.880* :  Keith Christensen at the Prado Museum in Madrid
*16:38.900- 16:40.340* :  came to Tim Franks.
*16:42.920- 16:44.920* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast?
*16:44.920- 16:46.820* :  It's all the someone going down the right,
*16:46.900- 16:49.380* :  which is all sorts of limbs in no particular order.
*16:49.620- 16:51.800* :  It's the hives, I think, straight through the middle,
*16:52.080- 16:54.880* :  takes it and look at the carnage behind him.
*16:55.160- 16:57.080* :  Why people flock from around the world
*16:57.080- 16:59.900* :  to chase a wheel of cheese down a hill?
*17:09.540- 17:12.720* :  Rescue crews in the US state of Texas have told the BBC
*17:12.720- 17:15.740* :  they have witnessed an unprecedented number of drownings
*17:15.740- 17:17.240* :  over the past year and a half,
*17:17.620- 17:19.620* :  as more and more people try to cross the river
*17:20.000- 17:21.520* :  on the US-Mexico border.
*17:22.060- 17:25.560* :  Undocumented migration into America hit record highs last year
*17:26.040- 17:28.720* :  and is a major issue ahead of the presidential election in November.
*17:28.720- 17:32.840* :  Tom Bateman has this report from the border town of Eagle Pass
*17:33.460- 17:36.120* :  and warning some listeners may find parts of it distressing.
*17:38.780- 17:41.880* :  Where the deadly waters of the Rio Grande meet the razor wire
*17:41.880- 17:43.840* :  of America's southern frontier.
*17:44.720- 17:47.540* :  A woman has waded her way from the Mexican side
*17:47.920- 17:51.520* :  across the river, finally reaching the safety of US soil.
*17:51.860- 17:53.300* :  She's gone back into the water?
*17:54.960- 17:56.440* :  Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
*17:57.520- 17:59.020* :  She's gone back into the water.
*17:59.480- 18:02.900* :  An activist, America Garcia Gruel, films the scene
*18:03.500- 18:05.400* :  as the woman is met by US guards
*18:05.740- 18:07.460* :  who are on the other side of the fence.
*18:08.240- 18:11.060* :  After the encounter, the woman returns to the river
*18:11.540- 18:12.640* :  and wades downstream.
*18:13.400- 18:17.340* :  The Rio Grande is notorious for the numbers killed trying to cross.
*18:17.940- 18:22.880* :  She goes around the corner and it goes into the dark
*18:22.880- 18:25.140* :  and I zoomed in as much as I can.
*18:25.480- 18:26.700* :  I couldn't see anything else.
*18:27.060- 18:28.660* :  Do you know what has happened to her?
*18:29.560- 18:30.080* :  I don't know.
*18:31.000- 18:34.260* :  How does it make you feel when you witness something like this?
*18:37.120- 18:39.520* :  I felt very helpless there.
*18:40.540- 18:42.120* :  This is one person, one story,
*18:42.120- 18:45.580* :  but this is happening hundreds of times here on our border.
*18:46.400- 18:49.400* :  We also tried to trace what happened to the woman in the water,
*18:49.900- 18:51.160* :  but her fate is unknown.
*18:52.120- 18:55.720* :  This part of Texas is the ground zero for America's bitter feud
*18:55.720- 18:56.760* :  over immigration.
*18:57.540- 19:01.400* :  As undocumented migration rates hit record highs over the last two years,
*19:01.880- 19:04.880* :  the Republican governor of Texas Greg Abbott sent troops
*19:04.920- 19:06.680* :  and raise a wire to the river.
*19:07.100- 19:09.500* :  He said to deter migrant crossings.
*19:10.060- 19:12.160* :  He calls it Operation Loan Star.
*19:12.660- 19:15.740* :  His opponents say it has only displaced crossings
*19:16.180- 19:18.380* :  and further endangered those who still try.
*19:22.200- 19:26.240* :  We had out with a Texas rescue crew racing to a call from the river.
*19:26.980- 19:28.880* :  Geared up to fight fires these days,
*19:28.880- 19:33.860* :  they are the first responders to a global surge of movement of people.
*19:37.620- 19:38.800* :  As we head down to the river,
*19:39.200- 19:43.600* :  firefighter Lieutenant Julio Valdez explains the risks of the Rio Grande.
*19:43.960- 19:45.200* :  People don't understand when they cross.
*19:45.260- 19:46.480* :  It's like right now it looks slow,
*19:47.140- 19:49.300* :  but as soon as they get in, they're going to feel the power of the river.
*19:49.800- 19:51.020* :  And it's always in the middle area,
*19:51.320- 19:52.480* :  and they miss on there to meet it.
*19:52.900- 19:54.420* :  It's a real invisible danger though.
*19:54.900- 19:55.540* :  It is a visible danger.
*20:00.780- 20:02.780* :  A border patrol boat heads to the shore,
*20:03.300- 20:05.160* :  but the rescue team's hopes quickly fade.
*20:05.800- 20:08.280* :  It carries the body of a man who had tried to cross.
*20:08.780- 20:11.440* :  The team uses a pole to pull him in.
*20:12.920- 20:16.740* :  The pickup truck has arrived now from a funeral chapel,
*20:17.900- 20:23.880* :  and they have unzipped the body of this man from the body bag,
*20:24.980- 20:26.980* :  wiping the moss off from his arms.
*20:28.520- 20:29.280* :  From his stomach.
*20:31.040- 20:36.640* :  So I think they're just checking for anything that might identify him.
*20:40.100- 20:42.100* :  In the corner of a cemetery in Eagle Pass
*20:42.540- 20:45.240* :  are the unidentified graves of many who have drowned.
*20:46.080- 20:48.600* :  Tragedy keeps flowing into this riverside town.
*20:49.220- 20:52.060* :  Immigration is now a decisive election issue at home,
*20:52.640- 20:56.780* :  but one they know here along the border also needs global answers.
*20:57.520- 20:59.680* :  Tom Bateman on the US-Mexico border.
*21:00.720- 21:03.960* :  Emergency teams in Papua New Guinea say recovery efforts
*21:03.960- 21:08.240* :  after a devastating landslide are being hampered by further ground movement.
*21:08.240- 21:12.400* :  The local disaster management agency says more than 2,000 people
*21:12.400- 21:13.920* :  are feared buried under the rubble.
*21:14.400- 21:17.420* :  Our Australia correspondent Katie Watson has the details.
*21:20.660- 21:24.000* :  So far, few bodies have been recovered after the landslide.
*21:24.540- 21:26.880* :  People are digging through rubble with bare hands.
*21:26.980- 21:30.680* :  They're in mourning, but they're still waiting to say they could bise.
*21:34.240- 21:38.540* :  I have 18 family members buried under the debris and soil I'm standing on
*21:38.580- 21:39.640* :  as even Canbu.
*21:40.240- 21:43.380* :  And there are many more family members in the village I cannot count.
*21:43.380- 21:47.580* :  I can't retrieve the bodies, so I'm standing here helplessly.
*21:48.380- 21:51.280* :  The final number of dead won't be known for some time.
*21:52.080- 21:55.160* :  Getting to this remote part of Papua New Guinea is a challenge.
*21:55.160- 21:59.200* :  Roads have been blocked by debris, and there are security concerns
*21:59.200- 22:01.240* :  because of nearby tribal violence.
*22:02.160- 22:04.340* :  And the conditions on the ground are still difficult.
*22:04.920- 22:09.500* :  Serhan actor-prac is chief of mission for the UN's migration agency in the country.
*22:09.900- 22:14.060* :  The land still sliding, rocks are falling from the mountain.
*22:14.920- 22:19.100* :  Ground soil is cracking because of the increase in constant pressure
*22:19.100- 22:22.180* :  that is put by this sliding debris.
*22:22.940- 22:26.920* :  When coupled with the ground water running under the debris,
*22:27.320- 22:32.420* :  the situation is very dangerous, not enabling the relief teams to do their work.
*22:33.000- 22:38.660* :  And, of course, threatening the nearby housing areas and communities.
*22:39.040- 22:41.600* :  Papua New Guinea has called for international assistance.
*22:42.040- 22:46.940* :  Neighboring Australia has already responded, and humanitarian agencies are on the ground.
*22:46.940- 22:52.400* :  But more help is needed in what's now looking more like a recovery than a rescue mission.
*22:52.940- 22:54.000* :  Katie Watson reporting.
*22:55.060- 22:59.180* :  Visiting a religious building with a temple, cathedral, mosque or synagogue
*22:59.680- 23:02.780* :  can evoke a sense of peace even for the non-believer.
*23:03.140- 23:08.160* :  In fact, here in Britain, a number of people are declaring themselves to be regular churchgoers
*23:08.420- 23:12.840* :  despite not actually being Christian, including the astronomer royal Lord Reese.
*23:13.700- 23:15.780* :  So what's the attraction for those without faith?
*23:16.060- 23:20.600* :  Johnny Diamond spoke to Joan Bakwell, brought up a Christian but who's now a humanist
*23:21.040- 23:23.360* :  and to author and broadcaster Tom Holland.
*23:23.980- 23:29.340* :  I think the churches and cathedrals were built to serve among many other purposes
*23:29.720- 23:37.420* :  as places for reflection, places to reflect on our relationship as mortal human beings
*23:38.300- 23:41.120* :  with the immensity of time and space.
*23:41.760- 23:46.800* :  And so I can absolutely see why an astronomer royal would get something out from it
*23:46.800- 23:50.540* :  without necessarily being a believing Christian at absolutely.
*23:51.060- 23:54.440* :  Joan, you were brought up a Christian, you no longer walk with faith.
*23:55.240- 23:58.260* :  But the building still means something to you, mean a lot to you?
*23:59.260- 24:00.100* :  Very much so.
*24:00.360- 24:06.500* :  There are places of contemplation regardless of which particular faith they are going right back through the ages.
*24:06.500- 24:13.200* :  There are places where people seek quiet and internal monologue with themselves and their spirit.
*24:13.720- 24:14.980* :  And I think that is a terminal.
*24:14.980- 24:17.660* :  I think that goes on from generation to generation.
*24:18.060- 24:19.480* :  Beauty matters a great deal.
*24:19.900- 24:27.240* :  Beauty, silence, the sense that people have been there for generations and have been thoughtful
*24:27.240- 24:34.240* :  and it leaves a mood of inspection, which you can sense when you go into these places.
*24:34.240- 24:37.020* :  You don't want to be noisy when you go into a church.
*24:37.500- 24:41.700* :  What of other faiths? I mean, you must have been into the odd mosque or two.
*24:41.720- 24:47.980* :  Are you similarly struck by it as a place of contemplation and a place where wisdom may be gained?
*24:48.800- 24:52.720* :  Yes, it's very interesting because I live in St John's ward and there's a mosque very nearby
*24:52.720- 24:55.820* :  and there's a synagogue very nearby and a church very nearby.
*24:55.820- 25:01.280* :  And I think how very happy that is that Jews and Muslims and Christians are all coming and going
*25:01.320- 25:06.500* :  to their various locations, which happen to be bricks and mortar, slightly different in structure.
*25:07.080- 25:12.780* :  But nonetheless, places where communities go to share a belief that they have with each other.
*25:12.900- 25:17.120* :  Tom, do you think this is all a bit sentimental about the buildings themselves?
*25:17.560- 25:21.340* :  I do feel quite sentimental about them.
*25:21.680- 25:24.220* :  And I think that the sentimentality exists on two levels.
*25:24.220- 25:28.400* :  The first is particularly the older churches.
*25:29.660- 25:36.320* :  They serve as records of history and you can go into them and you can see trace elements
*25:36.320- 25:40.720* :  from previous centuries on occasion reaching back maybe a thousand years or more.
*25:41.420- 25:43.780* :  And I find that kind of very moving.
*25:44.040- 25:50.440* :  And I suppose the other way in which I am moved is that as I get older,
*25:50.440- 25:55.320* :  I have an increasing sense of impatience with materialism.
*25:55.820- 26:01.300* :  The materialism that I suppose has been constant with me for most of my adult life.
*26:01.300- 26:06.720* :  The prospect that the supernatural might be real is something that becomes appealing to me.
*26:07.440- 26:11.920* :  And since I've been raised in a Christian culture, a Christian country,
*26:12.560- 26:17.500* :  Christianity is the the lightest way in which I can actually believe in that.
*26:18.080- 26:24.400* :  And so I personally do now go to church in the hope that perhaps I will be able to discover some sense of that.
