*01:32.920- 01:37.660* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 10th of May these are on main stories.
*01:38.260- 01:43.880* :  Evacuations begin near Harkiv as Russian forces are reported to be making advances into
*01:43.880- 01:49.920* :  Ukrainian territory. A rift widens between Israel and the US over the war in Gaza after
*01:49.920- 01:56.200* :  President Biden withholds a delivery of some weapons and the BBC tracks down the scorpion one
*01:56.200- 02:07.460* :  of Europe's most wanted people smugglers. Also in the podcast. If the current rates of decline
*02:07.460- 02:11.480* :  persist into the near future we could see the extinction of the species within our lifetime.
*02:12.040- 02:21.040* :  Is there a future for the African penguin in recent months there have been few military
*02:21.040- 02:26.960* :  advances on the ground in Ukraine. Both sides are very well dug in along hundreds of kilometers
*02:26.960- 02:32.700* :  of front lines. So when there is an advance elsewhere no matter how seemingly small it is likely
*02:32.700- 02:38.900* :  to be significant. Now military sources in Ukraine say Russian forces have advanced a kilometer
*02:38.900- 02:45.040* :  into Ukrainian territory near Harkiv. James Waterhouse is our correspondent in Kiev. He
*02:45.040- 02:49.180* :  told me more about the development. What the authorities are saying is that it came under
*02:49.180- 02:54.820* :  unprecedented shelling. I mean it's common for places to be struck so close to the border.
*02:55.480- 03:00.540* :  But at around five o'clock this morning we're told there are several Russian scouting groups.
*03:00.540- 03:03.900* :  These were coniston groups that were trying to make their way into different villages.
*03:04.600- 03:10.720* :  Before they tried to make a broader push with armored vehicles. Now one officer said they
*03:10.720- 03:15.840* :  gained a kilometer. Another said not a meter was conceded. I don't think this amounts to
*03:16.280- 03:21.740* :  the anticipated Russian offensive with the gathering of tens of thousands of troops across the border.
*03:21.740- 03:26.780* :  But it could well be. I mean Moscow has talked openly about this in the past. Russian forces
*03:26.780- 03:32.280* :  attempting to establish what's called a buffer zone because Ukrainian forces have increasingly
*03:32.280- 03:37.240* :  been shelling settlements in Russia's Belgorod region across the border. So this could
*03:37.240- 03:44.060* :  be Russia trying to extend the distance between Ukrainian troops and Russian territory. But of
*03:44.060- 03:47.820* :  course there's a psychological element as well here where they're looking to put the population
*03:47.820- 03:53.460* :  under pressure and potentially build for something more in terms of a wider offensive in the region.
*03:53.460- 03:59.840* :  But I don't think anyone in Ukrainian circles is expecting or fearing yet the cities of say Harkiv
*03:59.840- 04:05.020* :  or Sumi further north to fall. It's not thought in these parts that that Russia has the resources
*04:05.020- 04:10.380* :  to mount such an operation. And James those front lines I was talking about are very well established
*04:10.380- 04:14.200* :  aren't they and it will take a lot to move them. It absolutely would and it's not just about
*04:14.200- 04:19.580* :  punching through. It's about retaining what you've taken. I think both sides have learnt some
*04:19.580- 04:24.320* :  painful lessons there. Well you know we're talking about an estimated 35,000 gathering Russian
*04:24.320- 04:29.580* :  troops across the border. When there were more than 150,000 gathered right around Ukraine at the
*04:29.620- 04:34.840* :  start of the invasion those troops were better trained. They were unable to take any major city
*04:34.840- 04:39.640* :  apart from her son in the south. So I think while this is concerning for Ukraine while there is
*04:39.640- 04:44.180* :  heavy fighting while reserve troops are being brought in it's not thought that it's going to
*04:44.180- 04:51.380* :  amount a much more. James Waterhouse we will press ahead with military operations in the Gaza Strip
*04:51.480- 04:56.800* :  where prepared to stand alone and fight with our fingernails if necessary. That was the response
*04:56.800- 05:00.980* :  from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a decision by the United States
*05:00.980- 05:07.680* :  to withhold the delivery of some of America's biggest bombs. President Joe Biden is unhappy about
*05:07.680- 05:13.660* :  Israel's plans to attack Rafa in southern Gaza. But Mr Netanyahu calls it the last major stronghold
*05:13.660- 05:19.260* :  of Hamas. In a video message and Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said they had enough
*05:19.260- 05:29.540* :  weaponry to complete their mission. The IDF has armaments for the missions at plans and we also
*05:29.540- 05:35.120* :  have enough weaponry to complete our mission in Rafa. I say this here in the context of everything
*05:35.120- 05:40.900* :  that came up with the United States and it is important to say it the United States has helped
*05:40.900- 05:47.580* :  us in an unprecedented manner since the start of the war. Will Vernon is our correspondent in Washington
*05:48.120- 05:53.940* :  for several months now the Israelis have made repeated statements like this which have thrown
*05:53.940- 05:58.400* :  dirt really in the face of the Americans who have made very clear that they do not support
*05:58.920- 06:03.760* :  a major assault on Rafa that's why supplies of heavy weapons that can be used in population
*06:03.760- 06:09.960* :  centers are being suspended. The White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby he reiterated
*06:09.960- 06:16.140* :  those concerns yesterday he once again assured Israel and others that America continues to support
*06:16.140- 06:22.460* :  Israel's security and continues to support the goal of defeating Hamas but that smashing into
*06:22.460- 06:28.840* :  Rafa as he put it won't advance that goal. So I think these comments will anger the Americans
*06:28.840- 06:34.840* :  further and won't do anything whatsoever to persuade Washington that pausing deliveries of heavy
*06:34.840- 06:40.720* :  bombs was an ill-advised idea despite the opposition the White House is facing and there is
*06:40.720- 06:46.340* :  opposition from Republicans in Congress for example who are accusing Mr Biden of siding with
*06:46.340- 06:51.800* :  Hamas and abandoning a key ally in its hour of need. Will you mention those heavy bombs being
*06:51.800- 06:59.240* :  withheld? Washington must be making plans for if and when Mr Netanyahu does go fully into Rafa.
*06:59.600- 07:05.480* :  Are you getting any inkling as to what other bits of weaponry might be withheld if and when
*07:05.480- 07:11.080* :  that happens? Well the White House has been keen to underline that the vast majority of weapons
*07:11.080- 07:17.420* :  are still being delivered right it's just the heavy bombs 500 pounds 2000 pounds artillery shells
*07:17.960- 07:23.000* :  that kind of thing that the sort of weapons that can be used in a major operation in a population
*07:23.000- 07:28.380* :  center those are the ones that are being reviewed the deliveries haven't been stopped altogether
*07:28.380- 07:34.940* :  they've been delayed or paused so things like Israel's iron dome air defense system that isn't going
*07:34.940- 07:40.840* :  to kind of grind to a halt or anything like that of the other thing that could affect all of this
*07:40.840- 07:46.880* :  is a report that's due to be submitted to Congress very soon by the State Department looking at whether
*07:46.880- 07:52.220* :  US supplied weapons have been used by the Israelis in violation of international law that report
*07:52.220- 07:57.340* :  was due on Wednesday but has been delayed and there have been other independent reports and
*07:57.340- 08:03.280* :  accounts by human rights experts who found that the Israelis have acted with disregard for international
*08:03.340- 08:09.460* :  humanitarian law and that American supplied weapons have been used in a large number of cases and
*08:09.460- 08:13.800* :  in fact President Biden himself we were talking what we just a couple of days ago about the
*08:13.800- 08:18.660* :  interview he gave to CNN the main line from that conversation was that the US will withhold
*08:18.660- 08:23.360* :  deliveries of heavy weapons but the other thing that Mr. Biden said which really was a stunning
*08:23.360- 08:29.700* :  admission I thought is that American supplied heavy weapons have already been used to kill civilians
*08:29.700- 08:34.220* :  in Gaza so I think there's going to be a lot of scrutiny of this report when it finally does
*08:34.220- 08:38.600* :  get presented to Congress which we're expecting very soon indeed well Vernon
*08:39.840- 08:45.480* :  his nickname is the scorpion and he runs one of the largest people smuggling networks in Europe
*08:45.820- 08:51.040* :  his real name is Barzan Majeed an Interpol have been trying to track him down for years
*08:52.000- 08:57.540* :  but it was a BBC reporter Sue Mitchell with the help of a former soldier called Rob Laurie
*08:57.540- 09:03.200* :  who managed to do it as they probed further into Majeed's life and business it became clear
*09:03.200- 09:09.140* :  he was watching them as well it was a dangerous search that began in the English city of Nottingham
*09:09.240- 09:15.120* :  where Barzan Majeed used to live and with a tip off but a small local shop may still be working
*09:15.120- 09:22.020* :  with him can I speak to the manager please are you the manager hi my name is Sue Mitchell from BBC
*09:23.040- 09:28.520* :  right so it was having a conversation with him now the man behind the counter looks kind of
*09:28.740- 09:33.720* :  shocked a little bit some of the people who he's spoken to have gone to working car washes
*09:34.560- 09:40.060* :  around here and they've told us that they were picked up at Dover this was all arranged through
*09:40.060- 09:48.180* :  this shop who would it be if you're the manager though and we're told it's from here oh the manager's
*09:48.180- 09:53.240* :  not here sorry I thought you said you were the manager it's always very nerve-racking
*09:53.600- 10:01.380* :  confronting smugglers further up the chain oh I know so there's there's literally four cars pulled
*10:01.380- 10:11.920* :  up all with Kurdish males is everything all right oh we need to get out of here so getting the cat
*10:15.340- 10:20.640* :  before long we're getting help from inside scorpions network and we're told about a cafe in
*10:20.640- 10:26.400* :  Istanbul where gangs operate we go there to leave our phone number and to see if word gets back
*10:26.400- 10:31.900* :  to Barzan Majeed I showed that photograph to eight men around that fatte but did you see the
*10:31.900- 10:36.440* :  guy in the blue jacket he told everyone just basically shut up and then looked at me and started
*10:36.440- 10:41.000* :  smiling they're all gathering outside now yeah yeah they're coming from all directions out there
*10:41.980- 10:50.560* :  he will be warned now cars will have been made Rob's questioning pays off that night in the small
*10:50.560- 10:58.280* :  hours he gets a call from scorpion yeah but what I don't understand is why they've got you down as
*10:58.280- 11:06.120* :  the biggest human trafficker in history all over European media no never never even one day if they
*11:06.120- 11:14.100* :  get me arrested dumb guys have to be face to face to me see if it's telling the truth oh look he's come
*11:16.540- 11:22.600* :  we get a tip that scorpion's been spotted in a money exchange in Iraq and he's bought property
*11:22.600- 11:28.040* :  in a luxury housing development we head there with a minder and partner nearby when there's
*11:28.040- 11:33.640* :  an incredible coincidence you see that like that's been circling around for about 10 minutes now
*11:34.020- 11:40.740* :  and looking looking over you see the guy driving it he keeps looking over in recognition that was the
*11:40.740- 11:49.800* :  scorpion that is unbelievable that was definitely 100 percent that was him it's taken months but we found
*11:49.800- 11:55.240* :  Barzan Majeed he agrees to be interviewed how many people do you think you've smuggled through the UK
*11:55.960- 12:01.240* :  maybe a thousand maybe ten thousand I don't know I didn't count nobody forced them they
*12:01.240- 12:07.660* :  wanted to they beggin they beggin the smugglers please please do this do this for us
*12:07.940- 12:14.680* :  you know right you know that smuggling is illegal and highly dangerous you know that of course
*12:16.060- 12:21.740* :  I done it that report was by Sue Mitchell and you can hear the full story in a new series
*12:22.220- 12:29.080* :  intrigue to catch a scorpion you'll find it wherever you get your podcasts how long does it
*12:29.080- 12:35.880* :  take a hacker to crack a password well a new study by the IT firm hive systems suggests it could
*12:35.880- 12:42.800* :  be as quick as 37 seconds the European tech journalist Oceano Boost has seen the research which
*12:42.800- 12:49.560* :  is updated every year she told me about the latest findings what we see in this 2024 passport
*12:50.660- 12:59.500* :  is that very simple passwords short ones using only numbers or lowercase letters can be very easily
*12:59.500- 13:07.480* :  cracked and what is interesting is that these estimations in the table are actually in optimistic
*13:07.480- 13:15.040* :  scenario because the company used randomly generate passwords and that isn't what most people do
*13:15.540- 13:21.080* :  if you actually look at the table of passwords that are being used between what starts for example
*13:21.080- 13:28.380* :  or that our dictionary words short or long complex or not the estimation is that they can be
*13:28.380- 13:35.760* :  hacked instantly so the number 37 seconds comes up in this is that for these simple passwords
*13:35.760- 13:43.800* :  and how does it compare to previous years the 37 seconds it's for a very simple password but a
*13:44.160- 13:51.740* :  randomly generated one every year the methodology of the table changes we can see that the estimation
*13:51.940- 14:01.380* :  are going up compared to last year just because the firm based the 2024 analysis on a more
*14:01.380- 14:09.120* :  robust password encryption method but as computing power increases we'll probably see the time
*14:09.120- 14:15.180* :  declining again tell us more about the specifics about the eight numbers what seem to be the easiest
*14:15.180- 14:23.860* :  passwords to crack it's quite logical currently a lot of recommendation where let's go for eight
*14:23.860- 14:33.520* :  character we've a calculator a number sometimes a symbol but what we see is that length is actually
*14:33.520- 14:42.960* :  the men criteria and that we should upgrade the standards to a 16-counter password if we want to
*14:42.960- 14:49.420* :  have a stronger one well so 16 characters and this is largely because of the ability of computers
*14:49.420- 14:57.900* :  to hack passwords with fewer than 16 yes though the technique that is used behind this term
*14:58.060- 15:07.300* :  cracked for this analysis is the brute force so it's basically a try and error method where you
*15:07.300- 15:15.840* :  are trying with software to give a list of previously stolen passwords the most common ones for
*15:15.840- 15:23.360* :  example but you have some theft measures in place on websites this is why for example if you're
*15:23.360- 15:31.640* :  not mine person and you try three times a website we'll lock you off for example you have some
*15:31.640- 15:41.560* :  said gods to prevent this kind of attacks that was ocean debust still to come a new way to live the
*15:41.560- 15:46.680* :  experience of being on the jury of a murder trial as criminal barristers we're always a bit baffled
*15:46.720- 15:50.860* :  that people want to come and watch our day job with a packet of peanuts and a glass of peanut
*15:52.000- 16:06.380* :  but not everyone's convinced the South African government has found itself in deep water
*16:06.380- 16:11.460* :  with environmental groups conservationists are taking it to court over what they say is it's
*16:11.460- 16:18.180* :  failure to protect the African penguin from extinction the penguin population has reduced by 99
*16:18.180- 16:24.380* :  percent over the last century but wildlife experts hope their legal action might still save them
*16:24.380- 16:32.980* :  from South Africa Jenny Hill send this report the sea is swelling around South Africa's western
*16:32.980- 16:39.340* :  cape and there's a stench of fish in the air and in front of me there are scores of small penguins
*16:39.420- 16:44.960* :  picking their way across the shore one of them's just shaking his tail he's just come out of the
*16:44.960- 16:52.540* :  water these are African penguins there's a colony of them here but their existence is a precarious one
*16:55.960- 17:03.840* :  there are natural predators seals goals but the real enemy is human wrecking their habitat and taking
*17:03.840- 17:11.520* :  their food so you can see this one near the water is quite skinny you can see it hasn't got much
*17:11.520- 17:17.700* :  fat in it our list of McKinnis is a seabird conservationist his organization bird life
*17:17.700- 17:23.020* :  and another wildlife group are taking this South African government to court because every year
*17:23.020- 17:30.700* :  there are fewer penguins soon there may be none at all if the current rates of decline persistent
*17:30.700- 17:35.740* :  to the near future we could see the extinction of the species within our lifetime by 2035 so this
*17:35.740- 17:46.500* :  situation is extremely urgent hunger haunts the penguin colonies but a nearby wildlife shelter
*17:47.120- 17:51.600* :  workers do their best to feed up the casualties it happens when they're very
*17:51.680- 17:56.340* :  I'm ashamed then you can start with fish or food after 24 hours
*17:57.860- 18:03.060* :  the African penguin depends on sardines and anchovies but the fish are a valuable commodity too
*18:03.060- 18:11.200* :  for the fishing industry here so South Africa is entering untested legal waters fishermen are
*18:11.200- 18:17.660* :  already banned from some areas around the colonies conservationists want the courts to close off more
*18:19.760- 18:25.860* :  but as fishing boats putter in an out of the small harbors along the coast there's anger further
*18:25.860- 18:32.920* :  closures fishermen warn will cost money and jobs and it's unfair they say to put all the blame
*18:32.920- 18:39.760* :  on them we a fraction of the problem shameradhanials is from the South African Pallagic Fishing
*18:39.760- 18:47.260* :  Industry Association which represents many of those workers this predation seals sharks
*18:49.320- 18:55.980* :  we've got oil and gas exploitation noise pollution there's so much going on
*18:57.560- 19:04.580* :  it's just a short run 8 kilometers to the island 8.5 kilometers to the island it takes about 20
*19:04.640- 19:11.160* :  minutes by boats to get from the mainland to dire island there's another penguin colony there
*19:11.940- 19:18.480* :  salt sprayers flying as we bounce across the waves captaining the boat is a man who's well
*19:18.480- 19:24.900* :  spent a lifetime studying the wildlife of the area some of the first counts probably on the island
*19:24.940- 19:30.400* :  in 1973 they had 23,000 breeding pairs and now we down to a thousand
*19:31.180- 19:36.980* :  Wilfrid Cheval who manages the island is keeping a close eye on the legal action penguin numbers
*19:36.980- 19:44.520* :  can still recover he believes but it's down to people now if government fisheries and all the NGOs
*19:47.260- 19:51.220* :  play their part I think they've got a good future and what if they can't agree
*19:51.740- 19:59.000* :  then the penguins will suffer the South African government won't yet comment on the case
*19:59.540- 20:06.480* :  legal action can take a long time here already too late some fear for Africa's dying breed
*20:08.860- 20:15.280* :  Jenny Hill reporting now it's been a busy and unusual week for China's president Xi Jinping
*20:15.280- 20:20.540* :  he's just finished a five day tour of Europe as he leaves his final destination hungry
*20:21.180- 20:26.640* :  as the Xi also visited France and Serbia as part of his first tour of the continent in five years
*20:27.200- 20:32.680* :  despite the warm welcome offered by Victor Orban's hungry France and Serbia offered more muted
*20:32.680- 20:37.960* :  celebrations so how's it being received in China carry Alan is our China media analyst
*20:38.340- 20:43.440* :  this has been a huge success if you're reading Chinese newspapers that's the message that you
*20:43.440- 20:48.680* :  keep on getting again and again I keep seeing the word friendship used on broadcasters like
*20:48.680- 20:55.260* :  CCTV and in newspapers I think the relationship with Serbia in particular is extremely strong
*20:55.260- 21:00.780* :  so one of the things that's come out this week is a joint statement between the two countries has
*21:00.780- 21:05.980* :  been signed on the building of a community with a shared future and media have been saying that
*21:05.980- 21:11.660* :  this is the first European country to have this so yeah bringing China closer to the west is this
*21:11.660- 21:17.560* :  message that comes out because China sees opportunities in terms of building out was from China
*21:18.140- 21:23.140* :  but also just trade in general being able to enhance trade with countries and very much change
*21:23.760- 21:30.120* :  as she sees it the political kind of spectrum so the idea that the US has been this big global
*21:30.120- 21:35.960* :  superpower is the idea that China can work with smaller western countries together to actually
*21:35.960- 21:43.000* :  shift the balance if that makes sense that was carry Alan authoritarian rulers civil war ethnic
*21:43.000- 21:48.340* :  rivalries the central african nation of Chad has experienced them all since independence
*21:48.340- 21:53.720* :  and the outcome of the latest presidential election has done nothing to calm matters that is because
*21:53.720- 21:59.140* :  two people are now claiming to be the rightful president one is the mercury rule of Chad for the
*21:59.140- 22:04.260* :  past three years general Muhammad Debbie the other is his main rival the prime minister
*22:04.260- 22:11.320* :  suksei masra our reporter Paul and G is in Chad and I asked him what general Debbie and Mr
*22:11.320- 22:16.620* :  Mastra have been saying so general Debbie responded to the results by acknowledging his victory
*22:16.620- 22:21.460* :  and saying that he's going to serve all charians regardless of whether they voted for him or not
*22:21.460- 22:27.920* :  he has said his victory was overwhelming but his prime minister and opponent suksei masra is not
*22:27.920- 22:34.760* :  seeing it with the same lens masra has declared himself winner alleging a ploy to deprive him of his
*22:34.760- 22:40.680* :  victory he has called on his supporters to take to the street in what he called a peaceful mobilization
*22:40.680- 22:46.760* :  to defend their votes so on certain times here in Chad so he's calling for a peaceful demonstration
*22:46.760- 22:52.120* :  but how volatile is the situation do you think it is quite volatile things can change in Chad
*22:52.120- 22:57.200* :  at any moment especially at a time when the military are surveilling major parts of the streets
*22:57.200- 23:02.620* :  the military patrolling and of course yesterday after the results were announced we heard the military
*23:02.620- 23:07.700* :  fired gunshots in the air despite a prohibition from the authorities that would signal that
*23:07.700- 23:14.380* :  anything can happen at any time so the communists would determine how far suksei masra's supporters
*23:14.380- 23:19.700* :  are willing to go to in what he says is a defense of their votes but Chad right now is a matter of
*23:19.700- 23:25.300* :  the president vs his prime minister Chad and the people there have lived through many volatile
*23:26.200- 23:32.940* :  situations whose civil wars and the like what are people feel at times like this people are very
*23:32.940- 23:38.680* :  careful about expressing themselves on this issue especially publicly because they never know
*23:38.960- 23:44.020* :  who might be listening and it speaks to the volatility of the situation here over the last couple
*23:44.020- 23:50.260* :  of years as like you mentioned gone through you know coups gone through several episodes that are
*23:50.260- 23:56.140* :  very painful especially in 2022 where several people were acute in protests when they were denounced
*23:56.140- 24:02.140* :  the military decision to prolong the transition so it's just under that kind of context where people
*24:02.140- 24:07.200* :  now feel that the prolongation of the military regime gives them wondering for what the future might
*24:07.200- 24:12.840* :  look for Chad what would Chad rule be in future relations with its neighbors how will it address
*24:12.840- 24:18.040* :  security those are some of the boiling questions that remain in the minds and mouths of Chadians
*24:18.040- 24:24.660* :  I was Paul and G now it's a strange question but would you like to feel as if you were speaking
*24:24.660- 24:30.220* :  to a loved one who's died it's something to consider because a chat from beyond the grave could
*24:30.220- 24:36.800* :  soon be a very real prospect thanks to artificial intelligence AI companies are using data left by a
*24:36.800- 24:42.940* :  dead person to generate so-called grief bots but a team from the University of Cambridge in the UK
*24:42.940- 24:48.760* :  is warning against the impact that AI grief bots could have on the living I spoke to one of the
*24:48.760- 24:56.980* :  researchers Cassia Nolvanchek Pashinska there is a significant list of concerns here and we can
*24:56.980- 25:04.840* :  think about profit focus exploitation of personal data or in French upon the grief process or
*25:04.840- 25:12.100* :  emotional manipulation or privacy violation and just to give you a very quickly concrete examples
*25:12.100- 25:19.180* :  of a specific situations in our paper we present three hypothetical scenarios of technologies
*25:19.760- 25:27.100* :  that may appear on the market anytime because that's technically and legally possible and one of
*25:27.100- 25:36.020* :  the potential scenarios in the paper is mama that's the name of the company a conversational AI
*25:36.020- 25:42.880* :  service allowing people to create a deadbot simulating their disease grandmother without
*25:42.880- 25:50.580* :  consent of the data donor in the first scenario we present a situation when an adult ground
*25:50.700- 25:57.800* :  daughter creates in a matter of her grandmother and but her trust in this technology is shaken when
*25:57.800- 26:04.480* :  she realized that the deadbot of her grandma is used by the company not only to maintain relations
*26:04.480- 26:11.400* :  between them but also to sell her product it shows that this companies this technologies might
*26:11.400- 26:18.140* :  become a new space or might provide a new space for a very sneaky product. So exploitation commercial
*26:18.140- 26:24.640* :  exploitation that's a concern what what else another example depicts a terminally ill woman living
*26:24.640- 26:31.340* :  at that bot to assist her eight year old son with the grieving process and we use this example
*26:31.340- 26:38.680* :  because we think that exposing children as a particularly vulnerable group to this services might
*26:38.680- 26:43.980* :  be very very risky because at the moment we know very little about how these technologies would
*26:43.980- 26:50.940* :  influence children's psychology and it's worth highlighting that such research would be very
*26:50.940- 26:58.120* :  difficult also to to conduct so in that case we argue that if we can prove that this technology
*26:58.120- 27:03.880* :  won't be harmful we should take all possible measures to protect the most vulnerable and in
*27:03.880- 27:11.340* :  this case that would mean age restricted access to these technologies. So age restrictions would be
*27:11.340- 27:17.100* :  one of the rules you'd like to put in place what else also we should call for meaningful
*27:18.220- 27:25.320* :  transparency in recreation services so for example disclaimers on the risks and capabilities of
*27:25.320- 27:32.020* :  these systems would be very important so in other words we should make sure that users are aware
*27:32.020- 27:40.180* :  that they are interacting with AI. That was Kasia Novachek Pashinska and we end the podcast with
*27:40.180- 27:45.900* :  a bit of true crime it's a genre that's booming on Netflix podcasts and in books as well
*27:46.420- 27:52.160* :  possibly the only thing better is the thrill of being called up for jury duty a chance many of
*27:52.160- 27:57.880* :  us will never get but what about the opportunity to put yourself forward this report from Alfie
*27:57.880- 28:04.240* :  Habisham. Members of the jury if this is your verdict please answer yes if this is not your
*28:04.240- 28:09.680* :  verdict please answer no whether it's Alex Baldwin Stormy Daniels or Amber Heard we're all
*28:09.680- 28:15.560* :  experts when it comes to the big cases I told you so I told you so you can see the guilt on their
*28:15.560- 28:22.560* :  face we say to our friends and family when sat in front of the TV and often we're keen to put
*28:22.560- 28:29.080* :  our killer instincts to use but what if the moment just never arrives well Samuel Peary thinks
*28:29.080- 28:34.800* :  he might have the answer so the murder trial live is essentially a three hour long experience where
*28:34.980- 28:40.080* :  you sit in the seat of a juror you watch a murder trial that is played out fat actually
*28:40.080- 28:45.020* :  it's a fictional story but all of the kind of legal element the science is prepared by real baristas
*28:45.020- 28:49.680* :  so to the bar that would be used in a criminal court then basically you're asked to deliberate with
*28:49.680- 28:55.160* :  your fellow jurors and then basically to reach a judgment a verdict based on the information that
*28:55.160- 29:00.760* :  you've been given but how realistic can one evening of chin stroking with bar snacks really be
*29:00.760- 29:06.540* :  after all the laws not a show it can be thorough and painfully detailed and safe to say criminal
*29:06.540- 29:11.860* :  defense barrister Joanna Hardy Suskind is not impressed as criminal barristers we're always a bit
*29:11.860- 29:16.120* :  baffled that people want to come and watch our day job with a packet of peanuts and a glass of
*29:16.120- 29:22.380* :  peanut grigio you can see the attraction you can see how the excitement of a trial can be converted
*29:22.380- 29:27.060* :  into entertainment and I'm not here to be the fun police what harm is there in that being done
*29:27.060- 29:33.000* :  well quite a lot of harm by the sounds of it for the victims of crime a day in court is often a
*29:33.000- 29:38.900* :  terrible one made even worse by the idea of a public spectacle of course that doesn't change the
*29:38.900- 29:43.360* :  fact that some of us are still desperate to make our mark and perhaps it's for the best
*29:43.680- 29:47.120* :  that when we do get to have our big moment it's not the real thing
*29:49.300- 29:54.640* :  Alfie Habeson reporting and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of
