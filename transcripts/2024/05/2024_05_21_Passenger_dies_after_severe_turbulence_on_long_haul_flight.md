*01:28.060- 01:31.660* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Wednesday, the 22nd of May.
*01:31.660- 01:33.080* :  These are our main stories.
*01:33.740- 01:38.360* :  A passenger has died and dozens have been injured after a plane flying from London encountered
*01:38.760- 01:39.440* :  severe turbulence.
*01:40.240- 01:45.140* :  Ukraine has expressed gratitude to the EU for sending its profits generated from sea's
*01:45.140- 01:49.860* :  Russian central bank assets, but says the assets themselves should be used for Kiev's
*01:49.860- 01:50.420* :  war effort.
*01:51.140- 01:55.460* :  Players for Donald Trump have rested their case in the fraud trial of the former US president.
*01:58.300- 02:03.720* :  Also in this podcast, 16 of the world's largest AI firms have agreed on new safety guidelines
*02:03.720- 02:06.240* :  at the Global Artificial Intelligence Summit.
*02:06.820- 02:13.160* :  And we found that around periods of artillery fire or intense shelling are birds deviated
*02:13.160- 02:17.340* :  from their normal roots, causing them to change direction and fly further than they normally
*02:17.340- 02:18.160* :  would on migration.
*02:18.420- 02:21.080* :  How the war in Ukraine is affecting migrating birds.
*02:24.640- 02:29.340* :  One man has died and 30 people have been injured after a Singapore bound flight from London
*02:29.340- 02:33.660* :  was rocked by severe turbulence, while cabin crew were serving breakfast.
*02:34.360- 02:38.940* :  Singapore Airlines plane made an emergency landing in Bangkok, and some of those on board
*02:38.940- 02:41.620* :  have been describing it as the worst day of their lives.
*02:41.980- 02:43.240* :  Andrew Davis was there.
*02:43.840- 02:49.660* :  Literally, I think, as soon as I put it on, just a sudden, sudden thud and the aircraft
*02:49.660- 02:55.480* :  dropping, the thing that really stays in my mind is just seeing possessions and questions
*02:55.480- 02:58.320* :  and plates just flying up.
*02:58.580- 03:00.860* :  But when it stopped, everybody was very shaken.
*03:00.860- 03:03.920* :  And it sounds crazy to say it now, but I did go through my mind.
*03:03.920- 03:04.740* :  Is this fatal?
*03:04.740- 03:07.040* :  Is this going down?
*03:07.280- 03:12.020* :  I mean, remembering the plane now, the huge dense in the roof where people obviously hit
*03:12.020- 03:12.540* :  with their head.
*03:12.540- 03:17.560* :  There was a water bottle stuck in a gap in the ceiling, little bits of seat back lying
*03:17.560- 03:18.180* :  on the floor.
*03:18.180- 03:19.660* :  Gosh, it's really sounding quite bad.
*03:19.660- 03:21.520* :  And I don't think I realized how awful it was.
*03:21.760- 03:27.840* :  And unfortunately, the gentleman did lose his life, which was sitting on the road behind
*03:27.840- 03:28.060* :  me.
*03:28.520- 03:31.760* :  Jerry and his family were walking around as the plane plunged.
*03:32.200- 03:32.980* :  It was a long way.
*03:32.980- 03:34.680* :  So sudden, there was no warning at all.
*03:35.300- 03:39.280* :  And I ended up hitting my head on the ceiling, my wife did.
*03:40.080- 03:44.860* :  Some poor people were walking around, ended up doing some assaults, ended up in the hospital,
*03:45.480- 03:47.900* :  and it was fairly chaotic.
*03:48.500- 03:49.500* :  Lots of injured people.
*03:49.840- 03:51.820* :  They say 30, seeing more than 30 to me.
*03:52.260- 03:54.240* :  A correspondent, Theo Legert told me more.
*03:54.660- 03:56.000* :  So what happened with this aircraft?
*03:56.000- 04:00.800* :  Was it took off at about 10.30pm local time from London's Heathrow Airport on Monday evening?
*04:01.180- 04:06.340* :  It flew for about 10 hours, and then it encountered this area of turbulence as it was crossing
*04:06.340- 04:07.240* :  the Bay of Bengal.
*04:07.680- 04:09.060* :  We don't know exactly what happened.
*04:09.100- 04:14.360* :  I witness accounts say that people were thrown upwards into the storage cabins, that the oxygen
*04:14.360- 04:16.920* :  masks came down, that debris was flying through the cabin.
*04:16.920- 04:18.160* :  We've seen photos of it.
*04:18.680- 04:22.860* :  But the net result is that tragically one person died, a British gentleman who was 73.
*04:23.540- 04:26.000* :  And a large number of other people were injured, some of them seriously.
*04:26.520- 04:30.220* :  So there's no reason to think that anyone did anything wrong here.
*04:30.420- 04:35.720* :  We're just talking about something that can happen in very unusual circumstances on a flight.
*04:35.720- 04:40.000* :  And I suppose the likelihood is it's the people who happen to be wandering around the
*04:40.000- 04:44.220* :  plane at that time, going to the Lou going for a walk, who would have been at greatest risk.
*04:44.700- 04:45.320* :  Absolutely.
*04:45.760- 04:50.500* :  Airlines do go to a great deal of trouble to try and divert aircraft around areas in which
*04:50.500- 04:52.860* :  they think they may encounter turbulence.
*04:52.860- 04:57.620* :  And sometimes you can see it, storm cells, for example, planes will try and divert around
*04:57.620- 05:00.640* :  those because they know that they will encounter turbulence.
*05:01.000- 05:04.820* :  But there's a phenomenon called clear air turbulence, which is much more difficult to spot.
*05:04.820- 05:10.300* :  And pilots often rely on what the previous aircraft going through that area has said about
*05:10.300- 05:13.200* :  the weather conditions so that they know whether to avoid it or not.
*05:13.560- 05:18.320* :  So sometimes an aircraft will fly through severe turbulence without being able to avoid
*05:18.320- 05:18.540* :  it.
*05:18.940- 05:20.860* :  And in those cases, yes, simple bad luck.
*05:20.860- 05:24.860* :  If you happen to be moving around the aircraft, you're not restrained, you're the person
*05:24.860- 05:29.500* :  who is more likely to be injured, which is why when we travel on board planes, the pilot
*05:29.500- 05:33.820* :  will tell you, if you're sitting down, please keep your seat belt loosely fastened because
*05:33.820- 05:35.100* :  it can prevent injuries.
*05:35.580- 05:39.080* :  We know patterns of weather around the world are changing rapidly.
*05:39.080- 05:42.700* :  Is there any reason to think that this kind of turbulence will happen more often?
*05:43.340- 05:47.140* :  Well, if you listen to the climate scientists, yes, it's possible, though as some research
*05:47.140- 05:51.760* :  done by the University of Reading quite recently, in fact, which suggested that these kind of
*05:51.760- 05:56.520* :  episodes are becoming more common and will continue to do so during due to changes in
*05:56.520- 05:59.780* :  the atmosphere brought on probably by climate change.
*06:01.000- 06:02.900* :  But they are fairly common incidents anyway.
*06:03.660- 06:05.100* :  Fatalities are rare.
*06:05.700- 06:11.280* :  But some research done by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States quite recently
*06:11.280- 06:16.000* :  found that turbulence was one of the main causes of injuries in flights.
*06:16.340- 06:18.180* :  Still rare, but they do happen.
*06:18.680- 06:20.600* :  A correspondent, Theo Leggett, with me.
*06:21.300- 06:23.640* :  It's a planet's been on the table since 2022.
*06:23.940- 06:29.640* :  Now the European Union has formally approved the use of windfall profits from frozen Russian
*06:29.640- 06:31.840* :  central bank assets to arm Ukraine.
*06:32.660- 06:36.820* :  The news comes as Kiev continues to urge its allies to ramp up military aid for its
*06:36.820- 06:40.760* :  troops, who are struggling to stave off an intense Russian offensive in the east.
*06:41.280- 06:45.940* :  Speaking alongside his German counterpart in Kiev, Ukraine's foreign minister to metro
*06:46.760- 06:48.600* :  call for the EU to go even further.
*06:49.060- 06:57.300* :  We all know that the Russian frozen assets are worth around 260 billion euros.
*06:57.840- 07:02.540* :  While we are grateful for this decision today, the value does not correspond in size to the
*07:02.540- 07:04.200* :  amount of frozen assets.
*07:04.940- 07:08.900* :  That is why the third step, which we have been talking about since the beginning of the
*07:08.900- 07:13.080* :  year, should actually be the confiscation of the assets themselves.
*07:13.780- 07:16.800* :  Are you a regional editor Danny Abahard is following the story?
*07:17.300- 07:23.680* :  Most of the Russian central bank assets outside Russia are held by the European Union or
*07:23.680- 07:26.460* :  in the European Union, countries Belgium is the big one.
*07:26.920- 07:33.620* :  So of that 260 billion that you heard to meet your clever mention, about 220 billion
*07:33.620- 07:36.140* :  dollars is held within the EU.
*07:36.780- 07:42.200* :  So the interest they think might earn about 3 billion dollars this year alone.
*07:42.880- 07:44.580* :  So that's a sizable fee.
*07:45.000- 07:50.200* :  And basically what the EU is proposing is that a little bit of that interest is held by
*07:50.200- 07:53.720* :  the institutions that hold the money to cover potential litigation.
*07:53.900- 07:58.440* :  But most of it is going to be used to help Ukraine arm itself.
*07:58.960- 08:03.700* :  And then a small amount of it will be used to help its defence industry and also reconstruction.
*08:04.280- 08:08.780* :  There are some EU countries that are militarily neutral and they want to make sure that
*08:08.780- 08:11.720* :  that option was available as part of the spend.
*08:12.120- 08:14.600* :  The Ukraine saying what about the assets themselves?
*08:14.600- 08:15.920* :  That money will be useful.
*08:16.300- 08:19.140* :  Meantime it's taken the EU quite a long time to get to this point.
*08:19.500- 08:22.700* :  It certainly has legally, it's extremely complicated.
*08:23.320- 08:27.140* :  So there's a running debate, Andrew, about how to help Ukraine.
*08:27.540- 08:33.300* :  The idea being that under international law, Russia would be liable for the damages from
*08:33.300- 08:34.560* :  its war of aggression.
*08:34.960- 08:39.540* :  The EU is very clear, it says Russia's full-scale invasion was illegal, unjustifiable
*08:39.600- 08:40.460* :  and unprovoked.
*08:40.940- 08:43.180* :  So if that's the case, it's what to do next.
*08:43.580- 08:47.940* :  This is a first step, there is a wider debate confiscation of assets, that's what Ukraine
*08:47.940- 08:48.280* :  wants.
*08:48.700- 08:54.520* :  There's also a potential third way, which is to use the Russian assets as collateral for
*08:54.520- 08:59.340* :  a big loan to Ukraine that would be paid off through interest over years.
*09:00.320- 09:06.420* :  But there is fears that this might actually undermine the international financial system
*09:06.820- 09:11.120* :  and Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank recently warns that if Kiev's
*09:11.120- 09:15.340* :  allies are trying to protect the international order, that this may actually undermine it.
*09:15.620- 09:17.340* :  So this debate is a running one.
*09:17.340- 09:22.420* :  The G7 is looking into it and hopes to have some sort of update in the weeks and months
*09:24.040- 09:24.060* :  ahead.
*09:24.060- 09:24.420* :  There's a summit next month in Italy.
*09:24.560- 09:25.640* :  Anything from the Kremlin yet?
*09:25.700- 09:26.860* :  Who presumably won't be happy?
*09:27.280- 09:29.080* :  The Kremlin will be incensed by this.
*09:29.240- 09:32.980* :  I mean, they are very clear, they say that the Russian assets are protected by sovereign
*09:32.980- 09:38.580* :  immunity, that they would try to pursue through the international courts any attempt to seize
*09:38.580- 09:41.720* :  either the assets themselves or revenues from them.
*09:42.140- 09:44.220* :  And they've also threatened retaliation.
*09:44.220- 09:49.400* :  So we wait to see precisely what that retaliation could involve after this move.
*09:49.680- 09:51.760* :  Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhardt.
*09:52.260- 09:56.180* :  Both sides have now resting their cases in the sixth week of Donald Trump's criminal
*09:56.180- 10:00.040* :  trial without the former president following through on his vow to testify.
*10:00.700- 10:04.740* :  A jury will now decide if Mr. Trump was involved in covering up a payment to the adult
*10:04.740- 10:07.920* :  film actress Stormy Daniels allegedly to silence her.
*10:08.360- 10:12.180* :  Mr. Trump denies any involvement in this or claims he had sex with her.
*10:12.540- 10:15.760* :  I spoke to our North America correspondent, Nettaurfik, in New York.
*10:15.760- 10:17.720* :  It would have been quite a moment.
*10:17.780- 10:22.220* :  And one that Donald Trump himself said that he would do.
*10:22.220- 10:26.940* :  He had said publicly he would testify, but look, many legal analysts had doubted.
*10:27.340- 10:32.560* :  He would, given the fact that he would open himself up to damaging questions by prosecutors.
*10:33.480- 10:38.260* :  Questions that could hurt not just the legal case potentially, but also would be quite
*10:38.680- 10:41.900* :  embarrassing potentially for his run for the White House.
*10:41.900- 10:48.060* :  Questions like if he slept with the adult film star Stormy Daniels, which he has always denied.
*10:48.180- 10:53.920* :  And so no surprise really that Donald Trump has opted out of testifying.
*10:54.540- 11:01.480* :  Of course, jurors can't hold that against him because the burden of proof here is on the prosecution.
*11:01.620- 11:06.980* :  And so we will see the judge remind the jury that they cannot hold it against the former president
*11:06.980- 11:07.960* :  for not testifying.
*11:08.160- 11:10.440* :  So we've heard both sides of the argument.
*11:10.440- 11:12.420* :  What happens now, Nettaur?
*11:12.640- 11:18.020* :  Well, now the jury is going to come back to court next week, next Tuesday,
*11:18.020- 11:20.220* :  after the long US holiday weekend.
*11:20.340- 11:24.880* :  And that is when they will hear closing arguments by both sides.
*11:25.460- 11:33.120* :  Now, the prosecution has laid out their case to jurors over 20 witnesses, 200 pieces of evidence.
*11:34.060- 11:39.760* :  And the defense, on the other hand, has kind of tried to so doubt in their questions.
*11:40.460- 11:42.940* :  They ultimately called just two witnesses.
*11:43.580- 11:48.120* :  So closing arguments from the defense are going to be particularly interesting to listen to,
*11:48.120- 11:53.400* :  because that's when the defense is going to kind of wrap up their key arguments for the jury
*11:53.400- 11:55.840* :  and how they see the evidence fitting into that.
*11:56.600- 12:02.720* :  After that, the judge will instruct the jury on how they should interpret the law to come up
*12:02.720- 12:08.080* :  with a decision of whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt
*12:08.080- 12:14.780* :  that Donald Trump did falsify these business records in order to cover up the crime of trying to,
*12:14.940- 12:18.180* :  you know, break election laws in the United States.
*12:18.260- 12:21.500* :  And then the jury will get this case and they will deliberate.
*12:22.100- 12:26.820* :  Nettaur, in New York, three days of funeral ceremonies have begun in Iran
*12:26.820- 12:31.120* :  for President Abraham Raesi, who died in that helicopter crash on Sunday.
*12:31.140- 12:34.580* :  Thousands of mourners have joined a procession behind his coffin.
*12:35.180- 12:38.940* :  But our diplomatic correspondent Caroline Hawley says not everyone in Iran
*12:39.340- 12:40.740* :  is mourning the loss of their president.
*12:44.680- 12:47.920* :  Tightly packed crowds turned out to greet the open-sided truck
*12:47.920- 12:51.420* :  carrying the body of President Raesi, Iran's foreign minister,
*12:51.680- 12:53.960* :  and the six others who also died in the crash.
*12:54.780- 12:57.980* :  Some mourners try to push themselves forward to touch the coffins.
*12:58.840- 13:00.160* :  A few broke down in tears.
*13:01.020- 13:04.060* :  But most Iranians won't mourn the death of a hard-line president,
*13:04.620- 13:07.340* :  deeply unpopular for his role in crushing dissent.
*13:07.920- 13:13.100* :  Siavash Adelaan of BBC Persian has been monitoring social media to gauge the mood in Iran.
*13:13.760- 13:16.380* :  You have three groups of people, those who are opposed to the government,
*13:16.380- 13:18.840* :  who are very happy that the president is dead.
*13:19.420- 13:21.400* :  And then you have the social base of the regime.
*13:21.400- 13:24.700* :  People who are genuinely upset that their president has died and are taking
*13:24.700- 13:26.820* :  part in different mourning ceremonies.
*13:27.500- 13:30.660* :  And then you have a whole bunch of people who are just going to use this
*13:30.660- 13:34.520* :  opportunity, this five-day public holiday, to go away to the country,
*13:34.520- 13:37.100* :  to their cottage, and just get away from it all.
*13:37.620- 13:41.140* :  The Iranian police and our reporter to file dozens of cases against people
*13:41.140- 13:43.380* :  and publications for applauding the crash.
*13:44.060- 13:46.080* :  Shaken by the sudden death of its president,
*13:46.080- 13:50.620* :  the regime is attempting to show strength and project a sense of continuity.
*13:55.760- 13:59.160* :  Cres were said at the start of a meeting of the powerful assembly of experts,
*13:59.740- 14:03.960* :  the group which appoints a new supreme leader, the ultimate authority in the Islamic Republic.
*14:05.380- 14:09.180* :  Ayatollah Ali Hamani, the incumbent, is now 85 years old,
*14:09.560- 14:12.700* :  and Ibrahim Ra'isi had been seen as a potential successor.
*14:14.100- 14:16.700* :  A mourning ceremony will be held for him in Tehran tomorrow.
*14:17.400- 14:19.860* :  Russia and the Taliban are due to send representatives.
*14:20.020- 14:22.380* :  It's not clear who else will attend.
*14:23.080- 14:26.420* :  Acapulco in Mexico was once a big tourist destination,
*14:26.980- 14:30.060* :  but with a rapid increase in violence, those days are gone.
*14:30.100- 14:33.980* :  Now, 10 people have been found murdered, just days before elections.
*14:33.980- 14:37.300* :  I've been speaking to our Mexico correspondent, Will Grant.
*14:38.100- 14:42.100* :  The most grisly killings were of two women and four men.
*14:42.100- 14:43.540* :  That was near a market.
*14:44.180- 14:48.940* :  Now, there's disputes over exact numbers, but at least three others were killed in a separate
*14:48.940- 14:51.860* :  shooting in a neighborhood late at night.
*14:51.860- 14:55.760* :  That may have actually been four deaths, according to local media.
*14:56.140- 14:59.920* :  And then there was another incident in the tourist part of town,
*15:00.280- 15:02.500* :  which adds either another one or two more bodies,
*15:02.500- 15:07.860* :  so that the final total in a 24-hour period is either 10 or 12 deaths.
*15:07.860- 15:12.120* :  It is a shocking day of violence in Acapulco,
*15:12.120- 15:14.980* :  but ultimately not that uncommon.
*15:14.980- 15:18.180* :  So it is a very, very dangerous period in the city's history.
*15:18.440- 15:20.060* :  And Will help me with the change there,
*15:20.060- 15:23.000* :  because Acapulco is associated with dilemma,
*15:23.000- 15:25.760* :  with tourism, it's depicted in movies and songs,
*15:25.760- 15:26.780* :  and all that kind of thing.
*15:27.020- 15:28.260* :  One of the things changed so much.
*15:28.560- 15:32.720* :  Well, I think it's sort of 1950s, heyday, is now a long, long time ago.
*15:33.060- 15:38.980* :  Of course, it still has the image of this faded grandeur of a destination
*15:39.720- 15:43.760* :  for the rich and famous, the association with Elvis,
*15:43.760- 15:47.220* :  and of stars of the 1950s, and so on, Johnny Vice-Moller.
*15:47.680- 15:51.280* :  But in truth, Acapulco is situated in Gerard,
*15:51.280- 15:54.220* :  or one of the most violent states in Mexico.
*15:54.720- 15:59.400* :  And it is a place where cartel control is absolute
*15:59.500- 16:02.080* :  in certain neighborhoods of Acapulco,
*16:02.460- 16:04.320* :  other parts of the state are in dispute.
*16:04.460- 16:08.740* :  So there is violence involved in all of the key industries
*16:08.740- 16:11.060* :  in which drug cartels are interested,
*16:11.420- 16:13.000* :  whether or not there's obviously the drugs themselves,
*16:13.580- 16:16.100* :  the movement of migrants, the trafficking of guns,
*16:16.140- 16:17.400* :  the movement of money,
*16:17.840- 16:21.120* :  even into the agricultural sector in that state,
*16:21.140- 16:26.980* :  and the cartel involvement in the avocado industry, for example,
*16:26.980- 16:30.180* :  the control of the ports to bring in pre-cursor chemicals
*16:30.180- 16:34.000* :  for the production of methamphetamine and of fentanyl.
*16:34.000- 16:40.140* :  So yeah, it is an extremely difficult period in Gerardo and in Acapulco.
*16:40.340- 16:42.960* :  And there are elections coming up from your description.
*16:43.480- 16:45.840* :  Security must be playing a big part in them.
*16:46.180- 16:52.020* :  Yeah, security is increasingly one of the key issues in the election.
*16:52.020- 16:55.840* :  It appeared in a big way in the last presidential debate,
*16:55.840- 17:00.040* :  with, of course, opponents saying that the current government
*17:00.040- 17:01.720* :  hasn't done enough under President
*17:02.160- 17:04.880* :  and that his man will not be able to do it and therefore trying to attack.
*17:05.260- 17:07.780* :  His candidate, they candidate from his party,
*17:07.780- 17:10.000* :  Claudia Shambam, who's the front runner to become
*17:10.360- 17:11.820* :  Mexico's first woman president,
*17:11.960- 17:14.960* :  with the debate really circles around the role of the military,
*17:14.960- 17:18.740* :  President López Obrador, who's put the entire fight
*17:19.580- 17:22.060* :  in terms of the leading the security strategy
*17:22.060- 17:24.460* :  in the hands of the military to a large extent.
*17:25.000- 17:28.940* :  But he's also said that the concept should be hugs, not bullets,
*17:28.940- 17:32.160* :  what they call a brassos and nobalassos in Spanish.
*17:32.860- 17:34.260* :  Well, Grant with me from Mexico.
*17:36.960- 17:38.160* :  And still to come in this podcast?
*17:38.860- 17:41.680* :  Baby, how should you move on?
*17:41.780- 17:43.980* :  How do I touch it?
*17:44.820- 17:48.920* :  Well, catchy North Korean tune isn't hitting the right note in South Korea.
*17:56.060- 17:57.760* :  It's that time of the year.
*17:58.320- 17:59.980* :  You're a vacation as coming up.
*18:00.700- 18:02.780* :  You can already hear the beach waves,
*18:03.240- 18:07.520* :  feel the warm breeze, relax, and think about

*19:05.360- 19:09.280* :  16 of the world's largest AI firms have agreed on new safety guidelines
*19:09.280- 19:11.900* :  at the Global Artificial Intelligence Summit,
*19:11.900- 19:14.240* :  which was opened by the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
*19:14.520- 19:16.820* :  and his South Korean counterpart in Seoul.
*19:17.240- 19:20.600* :  They pledged that if their tools don't meet certain safety thresholds,
*19:20.760- 19:23.120* :  they'll stop developing them or allowing them to be used.
*19:23.120- 19:27.620* :  Those thresholds will be set in 2025 at the next summit in France.
*19:27.620- 19:30.220* :  Here's our technology editor Zoe Kleinman.
*19:30.660- 19:33.080* :  Today is the first day of this virtual summit,
*19:33.080- 19:36.780* :  which brings together world leaders and is being hosted by Rishi Sunak.
*19:37.220- 19:41.560* :  At the heart of the discussion was how to ensure that the rapidly evolving AI technology
*19:41.560- 19:46.520* :  can be deployed safely in order to maximise its benefits while minimising its risks.
*19:46.520- 19:50.880* :  A recent report by the Institute for AI Safety set up six months ago
*19:51.240- 19:54.480* :  acknowledged that there were currently inadequate methods for understanding
*19:54.480- 19:59.000* :  exactly how AI tools produced that output even for their developers.
*19:59.760- 20:02.360* :  Andrew Straits from the Independent Research Organization,
*20:02.400- 20:05.500* :  the Ada Lovelace Institute, said tougher rules were needed.
*20:05.940- 20:10.560* :  Our voluntary commitments are not sufficient if we're trying to get to the end goal of safe
*20:10.560- 20:12.900* :  and reliable AI systems that are benefiting people.
*20:13.720- 20:17.600* :  Volunteer commitments essentially are just the means of firms marking their own homework.
*20:17.600- 20:21.420* :  They're written in a way where they're often very vague and it's very easy for firms to say
*20:21.420- 20:23.500* :  the things they're already doing fit within them.
*20:24.360- 20:27.800* :  It's essentially no replacement for legally binding and enforceable rules.
*20:28.360- 20:31.400* :  Today the EU AI Act also got its final green light
*20:31.400- 20:35.320* :  becoming the world's first legislation governing the booming AI sector.
*20:35.860- 20:38.900* :  It contains strict rules about how AI tools can operate
*20:39.400- 20:42.040* :  with tough penalties for firms which fail to comply.
*20:42.760- 20:46.800* :  The authorities in the Indian capital have ordered the immediate closure of schools
*20:46.800- 20:48.640* :  because of an intense heat wave.
*20:48.640- 20:52.740* :  On Monday temperatures in Delhi reached 47 degrees Celsius.
*20:52.820- 20:57.480* :  The BBC's India Business Correspondent Arunade Mukaji sent us this report
*20:57.480- 20:59.000* :  about conditions in the city.
*21:00.180- 21:04.580* :  I'm in Delhi and it's early evening but still no signs of the day cooling down in the run
*21:04.580- 21:09.900* :  up to sunset. It's 45 degrees Celsius right now, sunny and very bright.
*21:10.660- 21:14.200* :  As soon as you walk out in the open there is a burning sensation on your skin.
*21:14.260- 21:19.860* :  When you're trying to breathe in it feels like you're breathing in hot fumes from an exhaust fan.
*21:19.860- 21:26.280* :  It's that bad. There is a light wind blowing which is making matters worse because it literally
*21:26.660- 21:29.920* :  slaps against your face reminding you just how hot it is.
*21:30.500- 21:33.720* :  People are walking around with umbrellas to try and shield themselves from the sun
*21:34.180- 21:37.460* :  or have had to cover their heads and faces to battle the intense heat.
*21:38.160- 21:41.540* :  Now just imagine the plight of all those who have to work in these conditions
*21:41.540- 21:45.640* :  like the labourers, construction workers and delivery agents sweating it out.
*21:46.160- 21:49.620* :  Also imagine India is conducting a massive election in this heat.
*21:50.100- 21:54.140* :  We have seen voter turnout being impacted which is why polling authorities have had to
*21:54.140- 21:58.800* :  extend voting timings sometimes to make it a bit easier for people coming out to vote.
*21:59.660- 22:04.160* :  And from an economy point of view well this heat could affect inflation if crop production
*22:04.160- 22:09.720* :  and transport is hit. The warning for now though is whether officials say this heat will
*22:09.720- 22:14.020* :  prevail for the next few days in several parts of north, west and central India.
*22:15.440- 22:20.220* :  Chalini Sinhar from Wego a global nonprofit that helps informal workers based in Delhi
*22:20.540- 22:23.840* :  sparked my colleague Rahul Tandon about the problems faced by workers there.
*22:24.400- 22:30.560* :  The street vendor who sells food in this kind of temperature with no refrigeration if they are on
*22:30.560- 22:37.300* :  a cart or in an unshaded place their food goes bad. Their income goes down because they may have
*22:37.300- 22:42.420* :  to reduce the number of hours that they are doing their economic work. They may have less
*22:42.420- 22:47.680* :  consumers on the streets but if you look at another sector where say a domestic worker works in
*22:48.500- 22:54.620* :  somebody's home they walk in this heat twice a day and they move from one house to another
*22:55.220- 23:01.460* :  doing part-time work which may be cooking, cleaning etc. Those who do cooking are in front of a
*23:01.460- 23:08.780* :  hot store for long hours. There is increasing evidence that in places like India it is
*23:09.600- 23:16.060* :  women often who bear the brunt of the excessive heat when it comes to the workplace. Is that what
*23:16.060- 23:21.680* :  you hear is that what you see? There are some sectors which are dominated by women and domestic
*23:21.680- 23:27.260* :  work is one and home this work is another. Both of these are invisible in the sense that they
*23:27.260- 23:35.420* :  are in either your employer's home or in your own home and women are often combining economic
*23:35.420- 23:40.540* :  activity with their care activity. So they have to take care of their own household,
*23:40.540- 23:47.100* :  hydration, families, hydration, well-being, health if anybody falls ill. So that increases their
*23:47.100- 23:54.920* :  work button. At the employer's house it is not factored in that this kind of impact of heat for
*23:54.920- 24:03.560* :  instance is impacting them. So you know no access to toilets, to clean drinking water or shade
*24:03.560- 24:10.100* :  or somewhere to sit or they have to invest in their own umbrellas in their own you know water bottles
*24:10.100- 24:17.560* :  all of those are eating into their income. Some of the adaptation strategies which are used by
*24:17.560- 24:24.040* :  the informal workers for instance change in time of work. So during the early hot hours you
*24:24.040- 24:30.740* :  don't work. Now a woman may not have that kind of flexibility to shift her economic work with
*24:30.940- 24:36.600* :  and care work because you know she really suffers from time poverty her day is long and divided into
*24:36.600- 24:43.500* :  care responsibilities and economic activities. You have very eloquently talked about the challenges
*24:43.500- 24:48.940* :  that women face. They don't have much protection from the problems that you have outlined. What more
*24:48.940- 24:56.560* :  can be done to offer them protection? So the heat stress plans that exist for instance. They
*24:56.560- 25:03.680* :  also identify vulnerable groups but there are short term measures in terms of awareness reducing
*25:03.680- 25:10.720* :  the hours of work but for a worker who lives hand to mouth reducing the hours of work is never
*25:10.720- 25:16.660* :  an option. So you know we have to think of more broader protection. So we have to think of
*25:16.660- 25:23.080* :  better housing, climate resilient, social protection schemes. We have to think of climate change
*25:23.080- 25:30.360* :  or heat stress insurance schemes workers can buy. So we have to think also short term and long term.
*25:31.140- 25:37.060* :  Chulimis inhar with Rahul Tandon. Now to a rather magnificent creature which rejoices in the Latin
*25:37.860- 25:48.640* :  clanger clanger. That's the sound of a greater spotted eagle, a rare migratory bird of prey which
*25:48.640- 25:54.420* :  flies every year to Belarus in eastern Europe to breed. Belarus is a neighbour of Ukraine and it
*25:54.420- 25:59.540* :  seems as if the war there is disrupting the eagle's flight path and potentially their ability to
*25:59.540- 26:05.680* :  reproduce. Charlie Russell of the University of East Anglia in the UK has been following 19 of
*26:05.680- 26:11.180* :  these eagles for a new study published in the journal Current Biology. He spoke to James Menendez.
*26:11.600- 26:17.540* :  We started working with greatest spotted eagles back in 2017. This is part of a wider project to
*26:17.540- 26:23.920* :  conserve the wetlands that they live in. To do that we started fitting GPS trackers to birds so
*26:23.920- 26:28.100* :  we could understand their movements and what habitats they were using to better inform conservation
*26:28.160- 26:32.840* :  efforts. We never really expected to be using these GPS tracks and following them through an active
*26:32.840- 26:37.740* :  conflict zone when we started this work. When they were migrating and they were getting close
*26:37.740- 26:44.020* :  to Ukraine, what was happening? What were the battles that were going on, the artillery fire,
*26:44.020- 26:49.780* :  the shell fire? What was that doing to their flight paths? As they were kind of returning to
*26:49.780- 26:55.320* :  the breeding grounds and entering Ukraine, we were seeing on the news as the conflict broke out
*26:55.320- 27:01.240* :  in Ukraine kind of what was going on and following our birds and their GPS tracks to see that they
*27:01.240- 27:07.800* :  could be any impact on them. We found that around periods of artillery fire or intense
*27:07.800- 27:13.560* :  shelling are birds deviated from their normal routes, causing them to change direction and fly
*27:13.560- 27:18.620* :  further than they normally would on migration. This was on average about 85 kilometres further,
*27:18.620- 27:25.380* :  but some birds flew as far as 250 kilometres compared to previous migrations. Not only were
*27:25.380- 27:30.120* :  they flying further and expanding more energy to do that, they were making fewer stopovers as well.
*27:30.320- 27:35.600* :  These are really important periods for them to either shelter from poor weather conditions or to
*27:35.800- 27:42.020* :  rest and refuel on their long journey in some of the most extreme cases. It's almost like running
*27:42.020- 27:48.020* :  a marathon but not being able to take any water breaks and having to go an extra seven or eight
*27:48.020- 27:52.400* :  miles at the end of it. They'll be arriving at the breeding grounds a little bit later than normal
*27:52.400- 27:59.440* :  and a lot more time from this migration. Their fitness at that time is really important for when
*27:59.440- 28:04.920* :  they start breeding. Do you suspect that this is happening to all the migrating greater spotted
*28:05.220- 28:09.280* :  eagles that this is a pattern that you would expect to find in most of the population?
*28:10.060- 28:16.200* :  Well, we work is home to an estimated 150 breeding pairs of greater spotted eagles. We suspect
*28:16.200- 28:21.800* :  that most of these birds will have migrated through Ukraine. Many of them for more intense conflict
*28:21.800- 28:27.420* :  areas than the birds that we were tracking. What is it that's special about these birds? I
*28:27.420- 28:31.740* :  imagine they're pretty impressive, are they? They're a wonderful bird. They're not the most
*28:32.080- 28:36.380* :  eagerly of eagles. When you think about eagles, you think of these, you know, large and majestic
*28:36.500- 28:41.060* :  soaring birds. You can quite commonly see them in these open wetland areas.
*28:43.000- 28:47.540* :  Waddling around in puddles, eating things like frogs and lizards, which I just find really
*28:47.540- 28:54.100* :  quite endearing. The sounds of the craters spotted eagle there with researcher Charlie Russell.
*28:54.600- 28:55.560* :  Now, what do you think of this?
*29:03.680- 29:08.680* :  It's a song from North Korea called Friendly Father, describing the virtues of its leader
*29:08.680- 29:14.620* :  Kim Jong-un. It's become a hit on TikTok since its release last month. South Korea is less keen.
*29:15.080- 29:19.540* :  In fact, media regulators in Seoul say they're banning this Pyongyang propaganda piece.
*29:20.040- 29:23.940* :  Bernadette Kiyo asked our Asia-Pacific editor, Syria Hatton. What's going on?
*29:24.280- 29:28.680* :  Well, it is catchy, isn't it? And that's really the issue in South Korea. The media
*29:28.680- 29:36.040* :  regulator has banned access to the song under the National Security Act. They say this song
*29:36.040- 29:43.620* :  idolizes and glorifies North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. They say it's a form of psychological warfare
*29:43.620- 29:48.500* :  because they say the song and the video that goes with it were actually made for an audience
*29:48.500- 29:53.680* :  outside North Korea. And because the song is in Korean, of course, it's going to be more
*29:53.680- 29:59.080* :  interesting to those in South Korea than anyone else who doesn't speak Korean. So they say this
*29:59.080- 30:04.420* :  really is a threat and they're going to take all 29 versions of the song that have gone viral
*30:04.420- 30:11.380* :  across TikTok and YouTube. They're going to take that down and they really are concerned that
*30:11.380- 30:18.180* :  this song is more than just something that's quite catchy. So why are they feeling? Why is the
*30:18.180- 30:23.900* :  South feeling so threatened? Well, people in South Korea say they think the song is fun to listen
*30:23.900- 30:29.460* :  to. They like to listen to it in the gym. They say it kind of harks back to a bygone era. But the
*30:29.460- 30:33.860* :  South Korean authorities are worried because they think the people are becoming a bit complacent
*30:33.860- 30:39.940* :  about risks. And that's because relations with neighboring North Korea are really dropping
*30:39.940- 30:45.860* :  to quite a low at the moment. A military pact between the two was thrown out last November. We've
*30:45.860- 30:51.860* :  seen a huge rise in the number of weapons tests conducted by North Korea. And of course, we have
*30:51.860- 30:58.440* :  to remember that North Korea now has a really powerful backer in Russia. And Russia is stopping
*30:58.440- 31:05.740* :  the UN from monitoring North Korea. It's North Korea has gotten new technology help. It's really
*31:05.740- 31:11.220* :  overhauling its weapon systems with Russia's help. And so South Korea really wants to remind
*31:11.220- 31:17.480* :  its own population that the threat from North Korea is still very real and is still very present.
*31:22.560- 31:26.100* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
