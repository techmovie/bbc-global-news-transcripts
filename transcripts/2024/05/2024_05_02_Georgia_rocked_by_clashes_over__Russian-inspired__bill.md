*01:19.120- 01:21.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.940- 01:28.540* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Thursday, the 2nd of May, these are our main stories.
*01:29.180- 01:34.800* :  Police in Georgia have fired tear gas at people protesting outside Parliament against legislation,
*01:34.800- 01:40.540* :  which they say is designed to stifle opposition to the government. The president of Columbia
*01:41.260- 01:46.720* :  University in New York says the college has been pushed to the brink by pro-Palestinian protests.
*01:47.720- 01:54.200* :  The team that designs and builds electric vehicle charging stations at Tesla say they've all
*01:54.200- 02:02.000* :  been sacked. Also in this podcast. Essentially there were 4 million homes which were abandoned.
*02:02.000- 02:07.560* :  The government doesn't know really who owns them. Nothing's been done with them. Many of them
*02:07.560- 02:14.560* :  are just sitting there rotting. So why are there so many abandoned houses across Japan? Find out later.
*02:18.080- 02:28.480* :  We begin in Georgia where the centre of the capital to Bliisi was brought to a standstill on Wednesday
*02:28.940- 02:34.720* :  by protesters taking part in a large anti-government demonstration. Police fired tear gas to clear large
*02:34.720- 02:41.100* :  crowds after legislators voted to give provisional approval to a new law. The foreign agents
*02:41.100- 02:47.100* :  legislation requires organisations to state whether they are funded from abroad. These people explained
*02:47.100- 02:53.360* :  why they were taking part in the protests. With the 2nd hearing the law has been passed, which is
*02:53.680- 02:59.520* :  absolutely ridiculous and stupid things to do in this situation right now, we are going to stand
*02:59.580- 03:06.720* :  till the end. It's what we are afraid of more. Being gasped, being beaten up or losing the country.
*03:06.720- 03:13.440* :  We're scared lifeless for losing the country to Russia and to the the government of traders.
*03:13.720- 03:17.560* :  More people are going to show up here and this government has no chance to stay in power.
*03:18.500- 03:23.080* :  I spoke to our correspondent Inter Bliisi Rehendermitri, who was amongst the protesters.
*03:24.700- 03:32.400* :  As you can probably hear the noise, I had to step away slightly from the main protest area,
*03:33.000- 03:37.980* :  but it's a really, really big crowd. Thousands, I don't know, maybe tens of thousands.
*03:38.680- 03:48.400* :  And the mainly young people, the police have already used repeatedly and pepper sprays and water
*03:48.400- 03:55.100* :  cannons, but people are refusing to disperse. So they're moving out of the area if they're being
*03:55.100- 04:03.820* :  hit by the tear gas and then going back. And the vibe and the mood is, people are just chanting
*04:03.820- 04:11.880* :  Sakarthwello, which means Georgia. They are clapping, they're trying to kind of maybe cheer themselves
*04:11.880- 04:16.760* :  up and to stay put where they are to continue their protest.
*04:16.760- 04:20.260* :  And Rehend, remind us what they are protesting about.
*04:20.580- 04:26.860* :  It started as a protest against a bill which the current administration is trying to pass.
*04:27.500- 04:32.800* :  It's called on the transparency of foreign funding and it's the second attempt by the Georgian
*04:32.800- 04:37.640* :  government to introduce this legislation in Georgia, the first attempt being last year,
*04:38.200- 04:43.080* :  and they had to pull back because they were mass protests then. So this year they reintroduced
*04:43.080- 04:49.060* :  this law and why is this law controversial or is seen as being controversial because it targets
*04:49.060- 04:55.260* :  Georgia's civil society, it targets non-governmental organizations and independent media.
*04:55.820- 05:02.600* :  It's been dubbed as the Russian law or kind of Russian-inspired law, but I think the protests now
*05:02.600- 05:09.500* :  increasingly are against the government and people are referring to the current government here
*05:09.500- 05:14.960* :  as the Russian government. A short while ago, I was in the nearby park, just near the protest
*05:14.960- 05:20.340* :  area because this protest is spread out to quite a large area, as I mentioned, people are moving
*05:20.340- 05:28.120* :  in and out. And there were printouts of Bidzina Ivanishvili, he's the founder of the governing
*05:28.120- 05:34.480* :  party called the Georgian Dream. He is Georgia's richest man and he recently made a political comeback.
*05:35.260- 05:41.000* :  So there were printouts of him and just lying on the ground and people were walking and stepping
*05:41.000- 05:48.320* :  on it with pleasure, I would say. And people are really angry at Bidzina Ivanishvili and his whole
*05:48.320- 05:56.140* :  political team for ignoring their voices, for really not commenting and not saying anything about
*05:56.140- 06:03.280* :  this ongoing protest. Rehendomitri in Georgia. For months now, the impact of the Israeli
*06:03.280- 06:08.760* :  air strikes and ground campaign in Gaza has prompted protests and marches in countries around
*06:08.760- 06:14.860* :  the world. It's raised questions about what is an acceptable form of protest? How should people
*06:14.860- 06:20.960* :  behave? Which banners and chance are seen as legitimate and which are antisemitic or incite
*06:20.960- 06:26.500* :  violence? All those issues have come to the fore in America in recent days, as protests at a
*06:26.500- 06:31.200* :  number of universities have led to hundreds of people being arrested. On Wednesday evening,
*06:31.200- 06:34.680* :  our correspondent Tom Bateman filed this report from Texas.
*06:37.980- 06:45.400* :  We're here in Dallas on the University of Texas campus. This was a peaceful protest
*06:45.400- 06:52.680* :  and singing chanting about 150 to 200 people were here and these state troopers are moving in
*06:52.680- 06:58.580* :  on us again. About 150 to 200 people were here singing, chanting, waving flags. There was then
*06:58.580- 07:05.340* :  pretty quickly a notice handed out by the University of Administration telling the protesters that
*07:05.340- 07:10.260* :  the encampment, the tents and the gazebos had to be removed immediately because they were in
*07:10.260- 07:18.460* :  breach of university rules or that they would be taken down. We then saw state troopers
*07:18.460- 07:28.060* :  riot police arms with batons, they got cable ties, zip tie handcuffs in riot gear, then began
*07:28.060- 07:34.360* :  to move in on this encampment. In blaze, they forced down the barricades that the protesters
*07:34.360- 07:40.580* :  had put in front of them and they're ripping down gazebos at the moment and tents and some of the
*07:40.580- 07:46.360* :  protesters joined hands in the middle of the encampment here were forcibly dragged away by the state
*07:46.360- 07:51.880* :  authorities. The effect it had is to utterly change the mood here so there's now a lot of anger,
*07:52.880- 08:01.040* :  chance of shame on you, some saying where were you in New Valde, the sense of tension and emotion
*08:01.660- 08:09.240* :  that high transformed the mood here. There is now a stand-on between the state troopers
*08:09.240- 08:16.420* :  and the protesters. Earlier in the day our correspondent, Eber Vardy, captured the mood in Los Angeles.
*08:18.920- 08:24.700* :  This was the moment tensions between rival protesters boiled over, pro-Palestinian activists
*08:24.700- 08:31.480* :  and a counter-demonstration by pro-Israel supporters became violent. Fireworks were thrown,
*08:31.540- 08:38.400* :  wooden barricades used as weapons. We have people amazing us, beating us with bats and sticks,
*08:38.400- 08:42.320* :  throwing whatever they could to us. I'm kind of annoyed at myself for not seeing it coming,
*08:42.320- 08:45.560* :  but I just don't understand that it would ever get to this escalated level.
*08:47.720- 08:52.780* :  The Los Angeles police were called in by the university, eventually officers separated the
*08:52.780- 08:58.220* :  rival groups. I'm a UCLA student, I deserve to go here, we pay tuition, this is our school,
*08:59.020- 09:03.220* :  and they're not letting me walk in. Some Jewish students say they felt threatened by the protests
*09:03.220- 09:06.560* :  and have been blocked by demonstrators from walking across campus.
*09:07.160- 09:11.900* :  I do not condone the actions of this pro-Israel mob. They were not UCLA students,
*09:11.980- 09:18.580* :  they were people in their late 20s, early 30s that came in here and took matters into their own
*09:18.580- 09:22.780* :  hands. But I do have to say, I understand why they did it because in their eyes,
*09:23.160- 09:28.720* :  they could see that UCLA administration was not doing anything about this anti-semitism that
*09:28.720- 09:33.800* :  is boiling in our backyard here at UCLA. As encampments have grown, there's been disruption
*09:33.800- 09:38.900* :  for many students in LA with campuses closed and graduation ceremonies scaled back.
*09:39.560- 09:43.280* :  There's particular frustration today for students who would have been taking exams.
*09:43.420- 09:46.980* :  Instead, a heavy police presence on campus will continue.
*09:47.500- 09:52.940* :  On Tuesday, there were also demonstrations that Colombia and the City University of New York,
*09:52.940- 09:58.640* :  both ending in clashes. Colombia, one of the buildings, was taken over by protesters who
*09:58.640- 10:02.240* :  barricaded themselves in and hung up Palestinian flag out of a window.
*10:03.040- 10:08.080* :  New York City's Mayor, Eric Adams, said the ring leaders of the break-in were not connected
*10:08.080- 10:13.760* :  with the university. Those who broke into the building did include students. It was led by
*10:13.760- 10:21.240* :  individuals who are not affiliated with the university. The school needed the NYPD's assistance
*10:21.240- 10:27.940* :  to clear Hamilton Hall and the encampments outside. A dual operation on the grounds that took
*10:27.940- 10:33.580* :  place successfully. Senators gathered in Washington to talk about the protests as well.
*10:33.580- 10:39.120* :  Republican Senator Tom Cotton called for President Biden to condemn the campus protests.
*10:39.680- 10:44.640* :  These criminals are chanting elimination slogans, like from the river to the sea,
*10:44.640- 10:51.700* :  Palestine will be free and globalize the intifada. At Stanford, they wore Hamas headbands. At Princeton,
*10:51.700- 10:56.660* :  they flew the Hezbollah flag. At George Washington University, they called for the final
*10:56.660- 11:04.080* :  solution and posted signs saying they wouldn't leave until Jews go back to their real homes.
*11:05.080- 11:11.640* :  The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken held talks in Israel on Wednesday for the seventh
*11:11.640- 11:17.360* :  time since the Hamas attacks on October 7th of last year. He met the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*11:17.360- 11:23.240* :  Netanyahu who has continued to make clear that he intends to go ahead with an offensive in the city
*11:23.240- 11:29.440* :  of Raffa in southern Gaza with or without a ceasefire agreement. And that is something Washington says
*11:29.440- 11:34.720* :  it's strongly opposed to. After the talks, Mr. Blinken visited the current Shalom crossing at
*11:34.720- 11:39.500* :  the southern end of the Gaza Strip where he saw dozens of trucks waiting to enter Gaza.
*11:39.940- 11:44.620* :  He renewed his call for Hamas to accept the ceasefire deal. What we discussed today,
*11:45.440- 11:51.480* :  among other things was getting this agreement, which involves an immediate ceasefire,
*11:52.000- 11:56.320* :  hostages home, and then working to build on it. And that's what we talked about today.
*11:56.720- 12:03.880* :  So let's see if we can get this done. Look, I think this is something that the whole world's
*12:03.880- 12:14.680* :  watching. And if Hamas actually reports to care about the Palestinian people and wants to see
*12:15.640- 12:20.120* :  an immediate alleviation of their suffering, it will take the deal.
*12:20.780- 12:25.720* :  Earlier, the errors crossing into northern Gaza was opened to allow more aid into the territory.
*12:26.340- 12:31.420* :  So are there any signs of an imminent deal? Our security correspondent Frank Gardner is in Jerusalem.
*12:32.200- 12:38.900* :  Not that has been made public. No, I mean, Hamas did issue a sort of interim statement,
*12:38.900- 12:45.340* :  essentially calling on Secretary Blinken to stop putting pressure on them saying,
*12:45.340- 12:49.760* :  you know, because he's been saying it's on Hamas now. It's up to them. And if this deal
*12:49.760- 12:54.060* :  doesn't go through, it's the fault of Hamas. They are studying the deal. But I think they're
*12:54.060- 12:59.120* :  fundamental misgiving about it is that it does not include a full and permanent ceasefire,
*12:59.120- 13:04.300* :  which is what they want. And Israel won't agree to that. This is a temporary pause in the
*13:04.300- 13:09.980* :  fighting as far as Israel's concerned. I also think it's an important point to make clear here,
*13:09.980- 13:15.260* :  because, you know, I listened to all of the press conference that Anthony Blinken, the
*13:15.260- 13:21.120* :  year Secretary of State, gave today in Ash Dodd in southern Israel, and listening to him,
*13:21.120- 13:26.300* :  you got the impression that this deal that's on the table is going to get all the hostages out.
*13:26.300- 13:34.360* :  It isn't. Even if it goes ahead, we are talking at most about a third of the remaining hostages
*13:34.360- 13:38.640* :  who are thought to be still alive. Hamas are not going to give up the other ones easily. You know,
*13:39.100- 13:46.120* :  this is their kind of not exactly their insurance, but, you know, if they give up all their hostages,
*13:46.120- 13:50.780* :  they will worry that they've got, you know, there's absolutely nothing to stop them being finished
*13:50.780- 13:55.980* :  off. Now, maybe that's going to happen anyhow. Remember that the U.S. is not keen on the Rafa
*13:56.980- 14:01.640* :  offensive, not because they've got any misgivings about finishing off Hamas, but they're worried
*14:02.080- 14:07.420* :  about the high concentration of civilians in Rafa. That's why they don't want the offensive to go
*14:07.580- 14:12.140* :  ahead. Frank Gardner in Jerusalem. While Israel has been fighting
*14:12.140- 14:17.680* :  is war against Hamas in Gaza, its northern border with Lebanon has seen daily exchanges with
*14:17.680- 14:23.600* :  Hisbola. Like Hamas, Hisbola is backed by Iran and prescribed as a terrorist organization
*14:23.600- 14:30.180* :  by the UK government and others. Hisbola has launched rocket and drones against Israel since
*14:30.180- 14:35.760* :  October the 7th. The Israeli military has hit back hard hitting thousands of targets in southern
*14:35.760- 14:41.360* :  Lebanon. Our correspondent Karin Torbe has been on patrol there with the UN's peacekeeping force.
*14:46.260- 14:51.460* :  Traveling to south of Lebanon is a risky journey. Accompanied by the Lebanese army,
*14:51.460- 14:58.000* :  we moved closer to the damaged towns dotted along this border area. Israel lies on the other side.
*14:59.980- 15:07.540* :  We are traveling with the UN to several towns in southern Lebanon. These towns have been
*15:07.680- 15:18.140* :  heavily bombed for seven months now. That's why we went with the UN the safest way to have a first
*15:18.140- 15:29.480* :  hand look into what is happening in this front. Empty villages, abandoned homes, peaceful life here
*15:29.480- 15:39.760* :  has been erased. Feels like a no-man's land. Mangled mount of cement and metal was a family home.
*15:40.680- 15:46.820* :  It was hit by an Israeli strike just a few days before our visit. Little left of the home it had been.
*15:46.920- 15:55.040* :  The family who lived here left months ago. Tens of thousands of people have fled in fear.
*15:55.740- 16:01.620* :  Israeli military strikes that were limited in scope have expanded, leaving towns across the south
*16:01.720- 16:09.880* :  deserted and destroyed. This was a coffee shop and next to it here was a two-story building
*16:09.920- 16:17.420* :  standing. Now it's reduced to one massive hole in the ground.
*16:19.540- 16:25.700* :  As we were leaving the area it was hit by an Israeli air strike. Israel says it hit 40
*16:25.700- 16:31.680* :  Hezbollah targets on this day mainly in the border town of Aaita Shab just a few miles from our
*16:31.680- 16:39.080* :  patrol. Same is from the town but has now staying with his family in an apartment on the outskirts of
*16:39.080- 16:44.280* :  the route. They left with what they could carry on the very first day of the border hostilities.
*16:44.380- 16:54.560* :  We showed him footage of the town filmed by us back in October. He said many of the buildings are
*16:54.560- 16:59.860* :  now totally destroyed. I told him that Israel claims it is targeting Hezbollah's fighters.
*17:02.520- 17:08.520* :  They are targeting civilians houses. It's systematic destruction. It's not true they are just
*17:08.520- 17:16.500* :  responding to attacks. Back on the road despite the intense violence the UN peacekeeping forces
*17:16.980- 17:22.880* :  still think they have a road to play. Many people are tired of the situation and I can imagine
*17:24.040- 17:31.040* :  people are tired also in the other side of the conflict. So I think it's time for peace.
*17:31.300- 17:37.120* :  The next challenge for a unit bill will be to help and support the local population in returning
*17:37.120- 17:43.360* :  back to their homes. Since the beginning of the war in Gaza this front has been more of a
*17:43.360- 17:49.580* :  side show. Fears are that at any moment it could take the center stage.
*17:50.440- 17:57.460* :  That report by Kareen Torbe in Southern Lebanon. In the US, Manhattan's district attorney says
*17:57.460- 18:03.360* :  the disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein will be retried in New York after having
*18:03.360- 18:10.200* :  his 2020 rape conviction overturned on appeal last week. Weinstein's conviction was seen as a
*18:10.200- 18:16.240* :  historic milestone for the Me Too movement which saw hundreds of men accused of sexual misconduct.
*18:16.860- 18:21.240* :  He's still in custody because of a separate conviction for rape in California for which he's
*18:21.240- 18:27.060* :  serving 16 years from New York at a terrific reports. Prosecutors told the judge that they still
*18:27.060- 18:32.280* :  had confidence in their case. They appeared in court with Jessica Mann, one of the two women who
*18:32.280- 18:37.680* :  helped put Weinstein in jail in the New York case and said she was there to show that she's not
*18:37.680- 18:44.260* :  backing down. That while Weinstein may have power and privilege, she has the truth. Gloria Allred
*18:44.260- 18:49.960* :  who represents the other accuser Mimi Halei said her client was still deciding whether to testify,
*18:49.980- 18:56.500* :  noting it wasn't an easy decision for her. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Allred said many had asked her
*18:56.500- 19:03.180* :  about the future of the Me Too movement. This movement is alive and well in New York, in California
*19:03.180- 19:08.820* :  and in many other states. Harvey Weinstein wearing a navy blue suit and a light blue tie was brought
*19:08.820- 19:14.140* :  into the courtroom in a wheelchair. His lawyer Arthur Eidala said he was suffering serious medical
*19:14.140- 19:19.820* :  issues but was sharp as a tack. He proclaimed Weinstein's innocence. We're very confident
*19:19.820- 19:25.200* :  that if he goes to trial, the only words will hear at the end of the trial are not guilty.
*19:25.440- 19:30.060* :  The disgraced movie mogul will remain in custody in New York until he is retried,
*19:30.380- 19:34.540* :  which the judge said could happen in September. Netatorfic in New York.
*19:35.440- 19:41.580* :  Next to Japan, a country that has a people problem. The government estimates that the current
*19:41.580- 19:48.840* :  population of 127 million will fall to under 90 million by 2060 and that means issues for the
*19:48.840- 19:53.600* :  economy and society as a whole. What are the most obvious effects of that? Are the number of
*19:53.600- 20:01.100* :  vacant houses known as Akaya? New figures show the country has nearly four million abandoned homes.
*20:01.100- 20:06.320* :  Most of them are in rural areas. Arraja Pacific editor Mickey Bristay told us more.
*20:06.740- 20:12.880* :  Stagrin numbers as you said just then. Essentially there were four million homes which were abandoned.
*20:12.880- 20:18.560* :  The government doesn't know really who owns them. Nothing's been done with them. Many of them are
*20:18.560- 20:25.560* :  just sitting there rotting, vines all over them or natures gradually taken over so they're just
*20:25.560- 20:31.660* :  sitting there. Nothing has been done with them. That's part of a bigger number, nine million homes
*20:31.660- 20:38.160* :  which are empty across Japan and that includes this bigger number includes homes which are for sale,
*20:38.160- 20:43.880* :  second homes and those are for rent but most of those homes extra homes are for rent and most of
*20:43.880- 20:49.660* :  those have been on the market for a lot of time so you can see there were millions and millions of
*20:49.660- 20:56.060* :  homes in Japan which have been unoccupied for a long period of time. And so how has it come to
*20:56.060- 21:01.820* :  this? Is it all about demographics? Mostly about demographics. There are a couple of things going
*21:01.820- 21:07.200* :  on. Firstly there's a shrinking population in Japan so there's less demand for homes because
*21:07.200- 21:13.620* :  simply there were fewer people. There's also a movement from the countryside towards cities.
*21:14.120- 21:20.780* :  So many of these homes is ackea homes in the countryside and that's because people, not only
*21:20.780- 21:24.660* :  there are fewer people but people are leaving the countryside for the cities. So those are the
*21:24.660- 21:31.000* :  demographic reasons. Also there are a number of government and bureaucratic reasons. So for example
*21:31.500- 21:38.100* :  it's cheaper to have a home on a piece of land than to clear it and have clear land. It's
*21:38.160- 21:43.540* :  fewer taxes on so there's no real incentive on people to knock down a home. And so essentially
*21:43.540- 21:48.720* :  you've got all these homes in rural areas, people often inherit them but they live in the cities
*21:48.720- 21:54.480* :  perhaps and they don't want, they can't sell them, they can't rent them out, there's no one to rent
*21:54.480- 21:59.300* :  them and they can't demolish them either because it's too expensive to do that so they're just
*21:59.340- 22:03.800* :  sitting there. There is a suggestion that actually it might be very attractive proposition for
*22:04.080- 22:09.580* :  foreigners, for people from abroad tourists who want a cheap property. Yeah there is a movement
*22:09.580- 22:14.900* :  of people who have sort of like seen these cheap properties in in Japan helped because of the
*22:15.240- 22:19.620* :  falling value of the end. So lots of tourists at the moment are currently making the way to Japan
*22:19.620- 22:25.840* :  because it's cheaper, houses are cheaper as well. There is a caveat to that and lots of foreigners
*22:25.840- 22:31.700* :  are being warned that once you get here, a lot of these homes are in really rural places out of
*22:31.700- 22:38.300* :  the way so there's no facilities, hospitals, supermarkets nearby. Also they're not necessarily
*22:38.300- 22:43.420* :  a lot of people work when available to do them up and it might cost a lot of money to repair them
*22:43.420- 22:47.480* :  so you get the house cheap but you really don't have enough money to do it up. Mickey Bristol.
*22:50.220- 22:54.440* :  Still to come. It's a terrible infection and we've known about it for over 20 years,
*22:54.440- 23:01.020* :  decimates bird populations and it's hard to get rid of. Scientists around the world are keeping an
*23:01.020- 23:15.240* :  eye on an unfolding bird flu outbreak in the US. Many of us have those stubborn pounds that seem

*24:18.200- 24:23.900* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. In this world nothing can be said to be certain
*24:23.900- 24:30.120* :  except death and taxes. So said Benjamin Franklin one of America's Founding Fathers.
*24:30.940- 24:37.080* :  But in Pakistan the payment and collection of taxes is far from certain. It's estimated that
*24:37.080- 24:43.960* :  just two percent of the country's 240 million people pay income tax. And that's a problem
*24:43.960- 24:48.700* :  for the government as it wrestles with a severe economic crisis and eye-watering levels of
*24:48.700- 24:54.280* :  international debt. And so it's pulling out a big stick to try to persuade more people to
*24:54.280- 24:59.740* :  cough up what they owe. It's asked the telecom authorities to block the SIM cards of more than
*24:59.740- 25:04.700* :  half a million people who have yet to file their tax returns for this year. And that means no calls,
*25:04.700- 25:11.540* :  no internet access. Shapa's Rana economics correspondent at Pakistan's Express Tribune
*25:11.900- 25:18.240* :  told James Millen there's more. We had seen a similar move back in 2011 when the then
*25:18.240- 25:24.280* :  government had tried to suspend the national identity cards of the non-filers of the income
*25:24.280- 25:29.500* :  tax returns. But that bill did not pass through. And the reason was that it is the fundamental
*25:29.500- 25:35.900* :  right of people of Pakistan to get certain services and those services would not be available
*25:35.900- 25:41.640* :  to people without the national identity card. The here the question arises, should the government
*25:41.640- 25:46.820* :  of Pakistan disconnect the mobile SIM cards? I wouldn't lead us to the next question, which is
*25:47.140- 25:51.620* :  the fundamental right of the people of Pakistan that includes the internet services.
*25:52.180- 25:58.600* :  But the counter-argument is here that the Pakistani laws they require at the same time that the
*25:58.600- 26:03.180* :  people they should comply with the law and they should file their annual income tax returns.
*26:03.400- 26:09.280* :  Why does so few people pay income tax, isn't it? Like about 2% or something of the population?
*26:10.040- 26:16.740* :  Well, at this point in time, only 4.5 million people and the companies have filed their annual
*26:16.740- 26:21.620* :  income tax returns. The number is quite low when you compare it with Pakistani population which is
*26:21.620- 26:29.580* :  roughly 250 million people. According to the FBR's own estimates, at least 10 million people should
*26:29.580- 26:35.700* :  have filed their annual income tax returns. What's your explanation? I mean, no one around the world
*26:35.700- 26:41.820* :  likes paying tax. But what is it about Pakistan? It's just really, really resent having to pay tax.
*26:42.560- 26:46.960* :  Well, the problem is that if you are caught in the West, then there is no remedy available to you.
*26:47.100- 26:52.180* :  You have to pay a price. You have to pay a penalty. The problem with country like Pakistan is that
*26:52.600- 26:56.920* :  after a few years, every government that is in the power, you would try to give a tax
*26:56.920- 27:02.360* :  emanating scheme. Where because of your status of non-filer, if you are caught, you have to pay,
*27:02.360- 27:08.900* :  let's say, 70% of your total income in the tax. But the government of Pakistan offers an
*27:08.900- 27:14.640* :  emanating scheme at the rate of 3% to 5%. So people would prefer to wait for three to four years
*27:14.640- 27:19.860* :  down the line and they would get an opportunity for a tax emanating scheme and go away with them.
*27:19.860- 27:24.580* :  And the second problem is with the corruption in Pakistani tax system. And you know, the problem
*27:24.580- 27:29.520* :  also lies with the tax man. One important step that the Prime Minister of Pakistan has taken just
*27:29.520- 27:37.400* :  last week. He removed at least 25 top tier tax men from their position because there were reports
*27:37.400- 27:41.920* :  against them by the country's intelligence agencies that these people were either involved
*27:42.060- 27:48.100* :  practices or they were lacking the competency to run those offices. So these kind of mayors
*27:48.100- 27:53.980* :  like removing the officers from their positions, blocking the SIM cards. The government of Pakistan
*27:53.980- 28:00.040* :  hopes that compelled people to come in the tax net. Shabas Rana from the express tribute in Pakistan.
*28:01.300- 28:07.280* :  A new exhibition has opened in Moscow featuring Western military machinery and firearms seized
*28:07.280- 28:13.440* :  by Russian troops in Ukraine. The display, which includes army vehicles from 12 different countries
*28:13.440- 28:19.740* :  as well as NATO equipment, coincides with Russia's Victory Day celebrations to commemorate the
*28:19.740- 28:24.100* :  end of the Second World War. Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, has been taking a look.
*28:24.680- 28:34.540* :  Russia today showed off its war trophies. In Moscow's Victory Park, the gates opened on a brand new
*28:34.540- 28:42.160* :  display. The Russian public crowded around the unusual exhibits. Western military hardware captured
*28:42.620- 28:49.200* :  during Russia's war in Ukraine. There were Western tanks that had been given to Kiev and American
*28:49.200- 28:56.340* :  Abrams and a leopard tank from Germany. I saw a British army husky tactical support vehicle
*28:56.460- 29:05.920* :  with bullet holes in its windscreen. Visitors seemed impressed. It's incredible jaw-dropping,
*29:06.100- 29:14.100* :  said Natalia, who was here with a husband and small daughter. It's amazing to think that our
*29:14.100- 29:21.080* :  guys managed to get these trophies. But why display them? The Russians have not invented the
*29:21.080- 29:27.400* :  wheel here. In the past, Ukraine has exhibited Russian military hardware captured by the Ukrainian
*29:27.400- 29:35.820* :  army. But in Russia's case, I think this exhibition has two main aims. First, to reinforce the
*29:35.820- 29:42.780* :  Kremlin's narrative that in Ukraine, the West is waging war against Russia. Although in reality,
*29:42.780- 29:49.700* :  it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. But also to convince the Russian people that in Ukraine,
*29:49.700- 29:56.480* :  Russia will emerge victorious. A large sign at the exhibition carried the key message.
*29:57.340- 30:01.480* :  Our victory is inevitable. Steve Rosenberg in Russia.
*30:02.880- 30:08.420* :  Staff at Tesla, say the entire team at the Carmaker Supercharger Division, have been fired.
*30:08.420- 30:13.540* :  The division was responsible for designing the electric vehicle, charges and deploying them
*30:13.540- 30:19.280* :  worldwide. Hundreds of employees worked with the team. Our technology editor Zoe Klyman reports.
*30:19.880- 30:23.780* :  In an internal memo, the co-founder Elon Musk wrote that the firm had to be
*30:23.780- 30:29.340* :  absolutely hardcore about headcount and cost reduction, and has said the company would cut
*30:29.340- 30:33.900* :  one in ten jobs. But the Supercharger network has been considered to be a success,
*30:34.480- 30:39.120* :  so disbanding the team behind it is surprising, and perhaps a glimpse at just how serious
*30:39.120- 30:44.180* :  Tesla's financial woes currently are. The firm might be aiming for China to help change its
*30:44.180- 30:49.540* :  fortunes. A new partnership with the Chinese giant Baidu could allow Tesla to go ahead with some
*30:49.540- 30:53.520* :  autonomous driving technology inside the country. Zoe Klyman.
*30:54.420- 30:59.120* :  Scientists around the world are keeping an eye on an unfolding bird flu outbreak in the United
*30:59.120- 31:05.220* :  States. The virus has infected herds of cattle in nine states. It's reported that one Texas
*31:05.220- 31:11.220* :  dairy worker has tested positive for the virus. So how worried should we be about bird flu?
*31:11.860- 31:17.840* :  James Reynolds spoke to Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious diseases expert and professor at the University
*31:17.840- 31:21.820* :  of Toronto. He first asked him to explain what exactly is bird flu.
*31:22.420- 31:27.860* :  It's a terrible infection, and we've known about it for over 20 years, decimates bird populations,
*31:27.860- 31:33.760* :  and it's hard to get rid of because it's in wild birds and migratory birds. So you can see how it
*31:33.760- 31:39.760* :  can spread all over the world. These birds die, and then what's happening is scavengers, scavenging
*31:39.760- 31:45.320* :  animals can be in close contact with dead or dying birds or their feces. They can pick up this
*31:45.320- 31:49.800* :  infection, and it's also rather devastating to many mammal species. So you've seen
*31:49.800- 31:57.200* :  diodes of sea lions, diodes of coyotes, cats, but then it got into dairy cows. And the issue is
*31:57.200- 32:02.820* :  that's a food security problem, and it's far more widespread than initially thought. We don't want
*32:02.820- 32:08.120* :  this infection to be in any animal, let alone in mammals because currently it's not very easily
*32:08.120- 32:13.460* :  transmitted from mammal to mammal. The concern is if we give it opportunities to be transmitted
*32:13.460- 32:18.260* :  from mammal to mammal, it could mutate, and it can be more readily transmitted between mammals,
*32:18.740- 32:23.700* :  and that's obviously a problem for mammals, including our food supply and including humor.
*32:23.740- 32:26.260* :  We do not want an epidemic or a pandemic again.
*32:26.400- 32:29.760* :  And anyone who's of a certain age will remember that there have been previous
*32:29.760- 32:34.320* :  bouts of bird flu, which have been heavily monitored. I remember working the BBC's Beijing
*32:34.320- 32:38.600* :  offices, Dr. Isaac Years ago, and we had a supply of medication in one of the covers. We had to keep
*32:39.260- 32:43.080* :  checking to make sure it hadn't expired. It hasn't gone past itself by date. How does this,
*32:43.080- 32:48.240* :  what we're seeing now compared to previous years? The burden globally is much higher than in years
*32:48.240- 32:54.160* :  past, and the burden not just in birds. You know, we've never seen it in dairy cows before. It has an
*32:54.160- 33:00.820* :  impacted food security to this extent before, and it's important to keep a close watch on this.
*33:00.860- 33:06.020* :  We've known this virus has had epidemic and pandemic potential for over 20 years. And to see
*33:06.020- 33:12.140* :  it spread in mammalian species is very concerning. On your list of huge priorities,
*33:12.140- 33:18.800* :  as a doctor, a scientist, you know, you've treated COVID, where does monitoring bird flu
*33:18.800- 33:23.780* :  rank on your current list of what you're keeping an eye on? It's the top. It's really high.
*33:23.960- 33:28.060* :  You know, anytime you have an infection with epidemic or pandemic potential, and it's doing
*33:28.060- 33:35.000* :  things that you haven't really seen it done before, it should raise significant red flag that's
*33:35.000- 33:40.020* :  important for the world to take notice. You know, not to throw it under the bus, but there was
*33:40.020- 33:45.040* :  a bit of a sluggish initial response in the United States to this, and that's unfortunate. We've
*33:45.040- 33:50.380* :  just been through a terrible pandemic. We know how important it is to be fast to cast a broad net
*33:50.380- 33:54.760* :  to take things very seriously up front to prevent further spread. And you know, I think they're
*33:54.760- 34:00.500* :  taking it rather seriously now, but the initial couple of weeks after learning about this in cows
*34:00.520- 34:05.420* :  was a bit sluggish, not the most transparent communication and obviously things have turned
*34:05.420- 34:09.520* :  around, but you know, this is an important infection. It's probably widespread elsewhere in the
*34:09.520- 34:12.180* :  other parts of the world, we're just not looking for it. We need to do better.
*34:12.760- 34:18.500* :  Dr. Isaac Bogguch from the University of Toronto. Now, there are a few things that provoke as much
*34:18.500- 34:24.460* :  passion in the world as professional sport, but what about if our childhood heroes just aren't
*34:24.460- 34:32.100* :  quite as enthusiastic about it as we are? On Wednesday, mixed martial arts and UFC star Stuart
*34:32.100- 34:36.920* :  Austin has admitted that he actually hates fighting. Alfie Habershire reports.
*34:40.360- 34:44.880* :  As two fighters step into the cage, the crowd rules around them. For months,
*34:44.880- 34:49.780* :  they've exchanged abuse at press conferences and money and fame is on the line.
*34:50.800- 34:55.960* :  As the bell rings, fists fly and legs flail as both try to knock each other to the floor,
*34:56.620- 35:02.200* :  and it's often a game of willpower, where you can win by smashing your opponent into knockout
*35:02.480- 35:05.540* :  or by making them submit from pure pain.
*35:12.800- 35:18.760* :  So the question is, how could you possibly set foot inside that cage if you didn't enjoy it?
*35:19.740- 35:23.640* :  Well, that's what British heavyweight fighter Stuart Austin is saying. In fact,
*35:23.640- 35:28.600* :  he's compared it to a job interview, which he finds horrible and stressful.
*35:29.540- 35:34.820* :  And safe to say, it's come as a bit of a shock. Because after all, UFC's biggest star
*35:34.820- 35:40.260* :  Connor McGregor famously likened his obsession with the sport to Vincent Van Gogh's with art.
*35:40.700- 35:48.620* :  I've lost my mind on this game here. Vincent Van Gogh dedicated his life to his art and lost his mind
*35:48.620- 35:54.080* :  in the process. That's happened to me. But Austin isn't the first athlete to let it slip,
*35:54.080- 35:59.640* :  that he's not that key on his job. Welsh former Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale may have been
*35:59.640- 36:05.080* :  champion of Europe five times, but he says, when the football's on the TV, he tends to switch over.
*36:05.940- 36:11.880* :  And while seven-time world champion Roneo Sullivan makes Nuka look effortless, he says he actually
