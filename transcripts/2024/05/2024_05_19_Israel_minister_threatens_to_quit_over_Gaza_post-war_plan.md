*00:57.240- 01:01.380* :  But naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*01:01.380- 01:04.640* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*01:25.700- 01:31.380* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Sunday, the 19th of May.
*01:31.380- 01:32.680* :  These are our main stories.
*01:33.360- 01:37.720* :  A senior member of Israel's coalition government has threatened to pull out unless the cabinet
*01:37.720- 01:41.380* :  agrees to his post-war plan for Gaza within three weeks.
*01:42.020- 01:47.360* :  Georgia's president has vetoed a controversial law that critics say stifles free speech,
*01:47.680- 01:49.960* :  but she can still be overruled by Parliament.
*01:50.880- 01:56.220* :  The jailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Nagas Mahamadi is facing new charges after
*01:56.220- 01:59.760* :  accusing the security forces of sexually assaulting women prisoners.
*02:02.640- 02:12.960* :  Also in this podcast, ecologists in Costa Rica have completed one of the largest ever eco-acoustic
*02:12.960- 02:15.900* :  surveys, recording the sounds of the forest.
*02:19.400- 02:22.520* :  He began in Israel with the tension at the heart of the government.
*02:22.540- 02:27.640* :  A key member of Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gans, has threatened to withdraw his centrist
*02:27.640- 02:32.500* :  party from the Israeli government, unless it agrees to a far-reaching plan for Gaza by
*02:32.500- 02:33.420* :  the 8th of June.
*02:33.520- 02:38.140* :  At a news conference, he demanded that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commit to
*02:38.140- 02:39.200* :  a number of goals.
*02:42.420- 02:44.260* :  The people of Israel are watching you.
*02:44.800- 02:47.660* :  You must choose between Zionism and cynicism.
*02:48.500- 02:54.640* :  Being unity in factions, between responsibility and lawlessness, between victory and disaster.
*02:55.540- 03:00.400* :  If you put the national over the personal, you will find us partners in the struggle.
*03:01.340- 03:06.620* :  But if you choose a path of fanatics and lead the entire nation to the abyss, we will
*03:06.620- 03:08.300* :  be forced to quit the government.
*03:08.900- 03:13.220* :  Mr Gans has demanded that the Israeli Prime Minister commit to six goals, including the
*03:13.220- 03:18.000* :  establishment of a post-war international administration for the Gaza Territory.
*03:18.500- 03:23.820* :  Mr Netanyahu has always insisted that Hamas must be defeated before any such plan can
*03:23.820- 03:24.580* :  be decided.
*03:25.140- 03:30.380* :  Earlier, the opposition leader, Yael Apead, told an anti-government demonstration in Tel Aviv
*03:30.380- 03:33.540* :  that Mr Gans and another war cabinet member should resign.
*03:34.100- 03:39.000* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, told Oliver Conway more about Mr Gans' concerns.
*03:39.960- 03:44.840* :  I think his concerns really are the same ones that we heard expressed by another member
*03:44.840- 03:49.240* :  of Mr Netanyahu's government, the Defence Minister, Yael Apead, just a few days ago,
*03:49.280- 03:56.980* :  which is the absence of what they both see, the absence of a clear plan, both for the conclusion
*03:57.060- 04:01.600* :  of the war in Gaza, but also crucially for what happens afterwards.
*04:02.480- 04:08.140* :  And so Mr Gans is doing something Al-An didn't do, which is to set a deadline of three weeks
*04:08.140- 04:14.240* :  from now, after which he says that if the government does not adopt this six-point plan,
*04:14.240- 04:19.680* :  which he outlined, then he will withdraw his party from the coalition.
*04:20.400- 04:26.080* :  So that is the kind of latest sign of the very deep divisions that have become increasingly
*04:26.080- 04:28.560* :  apparent the longer this war has gone on.
*04:28.960- 04:35.200* :  And what does it mean for the Israeli government, is Mr Netanyahu likely to change his position
*04:35.240- 04:35.660* :  on this?
*04:35.900- 04:36.620* :  No, I don't think so.
*04:36.820- 04:38.940* :  I think he'll call Mr Gans' bluff.
*04:39.340- 04:42.860* :  I mean, the thing about this is, you know, Mr Gans can threaten to withdraw from the
*04:42.860- 04:47.300* :  government, but he knows that he is not capable of bringing the government down.
*04:47.940- 04:51.920* :  Mr Netanyahu still has the support of the far right parties.
*04:52.460- 04:54.840* :  They are the ones on whom he relies heavily.
*04:55.480- 05:00.580* :  And if Mr Gans does carry out his threat in three weeks' time, the government will survive.
*05:00.760- 05:05.720* :  He knows that, and there are some skeptics tonight who think that it is unlikely that
*05:05.720- 05:08.540* :  he will carry out his threat on June the 8th.
*05:09.820- 05:17.620* :  As I say, alongside the kind of impassioned plea for a strategy from Yoav Galant, you really
*05:17.620- 05:24.540* :  have two people, two people who are held still in pretty high regard by some of Israel's
*05:24.540- 05:29.560* :  allies, particularly in Washington, two people saying, we're on the wrong course and we need
*05:29.560- 05:30.700* :  to do something about it.
*05:31.060- 05:37.440* :  And for me, that is the return of naked politics after months in which, you know, the government
*05:37.460- 05:41.080* :  came together, the nation came together in the wake of the awful events of October
*05:41.080- 05:41.780* :  the 7th.
*05:42.340- 05:46.880* :  That sense of unity in the government, that is crumbling, and it is crumbling rather
*05:46.880- 05:47.420* :  visibly.
*05:47.760- 05:54.040* :  And as you say, echoed by some of Israel's key allies, I mean, what is Benjamin Netanyahu's
*05:54.160- 05:55.800* :  long-term plan for Gaza?
*05:56.100- 05:57.540* :  Well, that's the question they're all asking.
*05:58.020- 05:59.720* :  Don't ask me because I don't know either.
*06:00.300- 06:01.440* :  I mean, that is the point.
*06:01.980- 06:08.740* :  They want to know, do you intend to stay in civilian and military control of Gaza when
*06:08.740- 06:13.300* :  the war is over, neither of the two believe that that is a viable course of action?
*06:13.880- 06:21.300* :  What form of future leadership are you envisaging for Gaza after, if and when, Israeli troops
*06:21.300- 06:21.800* :  withdraw?
*06:22.100- 06:25.280* :  Now, fundamental questions about what happens next.
*06:25.920- 06:31.560* :  These remain mysteries, and Mr. Netanyahu has said who he doesn't want in control of
*06:31.560- 06:35.160* :  Gaza, he doesn't want Hamas and he doesn't want the Palestinian leadership in the West
*06:35.160- 06:39.880* :  Bank, but he hasn't really said who he does want to have in control, and that is worrying
*06:39.880- 06:40.640* :  the two ministers.
*06:41.080- 06:45.700* :  And how is this issue, and indeed this row, likely to be seen by the Israeli public?
*06:45.840- 06:48.020* :  I don't think there will be terribly surprised by it.
*06:48.100- 06:50.080* :  These are not natural allies.
*06:50.680- 06:53.120* :  They came together at a moment of national crisis.
*06:53.800- 06:58.820* :  Mr. Netanyahu is regarded as both a great political survivor, but also a great political
*06:58.820- 07:06.420* :  operator and manipulator, and I think this will be seen as a return in a way to politics
*07:06.420- 07:14.340* :  as Israelis know it, which is kind of nakedly confrontational and with the prospect of
*07:14.340- 07:16.640* :  a government collapse always just around the corner.
*07:17.080- 07:18.480* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*07:19.360- 07:24.560* :  With key land crossings into Gaza closed or operating in limited capacity because of
*07:24.560- 07:29.000* :  the fighting, some aid has begun entering the territory via a temporary U.S. built
*07:29.000- 07:29.980* :  floating pier.
*07:30.560- 07:36.580* :  These ready army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in what it said was the first entry
*07:36.580- 07:39.000* :  of humanitarian aid through the floating pier.
*07:39.480- 07:43.840* :  Satellite pictures showed more than a dozen trucks lining up on Saturday on the pier's
*07:43.840- 07:44.620* :  approach road.
*07:45.100- 07:49.980* :  According to U.S. Central Command, around 500 tons of aid are expected to be delivered
*07:49.980- 07:51.320* :  to Gaza using the pier.
*07:51.960- 07:56.580* :  To discuss what differences this route will make, James Kumara-Sanami spoke to Sam Rose,
*07:56.580- 08:00.600* :  director of planning for Onra, the main UN relief agency in Gaza.
*08:01.620- 08:07.500* :  It's been quite a complex long term and expensive effort to get this thing up and running.
*08:07.980- 08:08.960* :  We welcome it.
*08:08.960- 08:14.480* :  We welcome all efforts to get more aid into Gaza and we hope that the flow will increase
*08:14.480- 08:20.480* :  over the coming days, but it's a very small drop in a very big bucket now in relation
*08:20.480- 08:22.660* :  to the needs of the people inside Gaza.
*08:23.160- 08:25.240* :  And how is that aid going to be distributed?
*08:26.260- 08:31.760* :  The aid will come on shore, it will go to you and warehouses, not onra warehouses and
*08:31.760- 08:37.520* :  it will be distributed from there to the agencies who have been identified before it leaves
*08:38.040- 08:41.420* :  Cyprus as the recipients or as we call it, the consignees.
*08:41.680- 08:45.140* :  But literally when you're talking about 10 trucks worth of aid, and as I say we hope
*08:45.140- 08:49.600* :  that will increase in the coming days, it's very, very little, it's important that
*08:49.600- 08:55.260* :  this doesn't distract from the attention on RAFA and the urgency of getting the RAFA
*08:55.600- 09:00.740* :  and Keram Shalom border crossings opened to allow for shipments of aid to come in at
*09:00.760- 09:02.200* :  the required volumes.
*09:02.800- 09:07.340* :  Yes, there was another call from the White House for those crossings to be opened.
*09:07.340- 09:09.380* :  What is the current situation?
*09:10.080- 09:15.280* :  The current situation is that since the 8th of May or early May, when the operation in
*09:15.280- 09:20.620* :  RAFA started and it started with an attack by Hamas on an Israeli military post that
*09:20.620- 09:26.700* :  the flow of aid into RAFA from Keram Shalom is essentially ground to a halt.
*09:26.700- 09:32.420* :  We have been able to get small amounts in, but this is an active conflict zone, it means
*09:32.480- 09:37.880* :  it's very complicated, it's very difficult and it's very dangerous for eight teams to
*09:37.880- 09:43.800* :  move in and out of the area close to the border crossing and get those supplies in.
*09:43.800- 09:49.180* :  We're talking of tens of trucks that have come in since the 8th of May and before that,
*09:49.180- 09:54.380* :  we were looking at 300 a day, so it's the volumes through RAFA, Keram Shalom have really,
*09:54.380- 09:59.060* :  really diminished and we as unread the largest agency, we're essentially out of supplies
*09:59.060- 09:59.540* :  right now.
*09:59.900- 10:03.280* :  Sam rose from unread the main UN relief agency in Gaza.
*10:03.940- 10:09.500* :  The jailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Nagez Mahabadi faces a new trial after
*10:09.500- 10:13.400* :  she accused the security forces of sexually assaulting female prisoners.
*10:14.060- 10:18.160* :  Her families say the trial, the fourth such case against her, will begin on Sunday.
*10:18.640- 10:19.420* :  Here's Mike Thompson.
*10:20.060- 10:26.120* :  Despite having spent 12 years of her life in jail, rights campaigner Nagez Mahabadi is
*10:26.120- 10:28.000* :  far from afraid to speak out.
*10:28.360- 10:33.720* :  Last month she sent supporters and audio message from Tehran's Evine Prison, acuting the
*10:33.720- 10:37.680* :  Iranian government of launching a full-scale war against women.
*10:38.240- 10:43.260* :  And she urged Iranian women to share their stories of arrest and sexual assault at the hands
*10:43.260- 10:44.220* :  of the authorities.
*10:44.720- 10:49.880* :  While Miss Muhammadiz words may have inspired her many followers, they clearly didn't go
*10:49.880- 10:55.340* :  down well with the country's hardline Islamic regime, who promptly filed fresh charges against
*10:55.400- 10:55.640* :  her.
*10:56.580- 11:01.460* :  George's president has vetoed a controversial new law on foreign funding that sparked
*11:01.460- 11:02.740* :  weeks of protests.
*11:03.420- 11:08.620* :  Salome Zor Abishvili said the legislation was Russian in both spirit and essence and
*11:08.620- 11:11.700* :  was an obstacle to George's path to EU membership.
*11:12.180- 11:13.820* :  Here's our correspondent, Reyn Demetri.
*11:14.380- 11:19.740* :  President Salome Zor Abishvili fulfilled her promise and vetoed the law on the transparency
*11:19.740- 11:20.800* :  of foreign funding.
*11:21.280- 11:26.680* :  The bill requires non-governmental organizations and media outlets which receive more than
*11:26.680- 11:32.200* :  a fifth of their funding from abroad to register as bodies pursuing the interests of a foreign
*11:32.200- 11:32.640* :  power.
*11:33.280- 11:37.440* :  But the governing Georgian Dream Party, which introduced the legislation in the first place,
*11:37.440- 11:40.500* :  can override the president's veto by simple majority.
*11:41.180- 11:45.860* :  Tens of thousands of Georgians have been protesting against the proposed legislation for more than
*11:45.860- 11:46.240* :  a month.
*11:46.580- 11:51.820* :  They say its adoption marks a turning point for Georgia's democracy and believe that it
*11:51.820- 11:54.000* :  will be used to silence government critics.
*11:55.120- 11:59.780* :  Ukrainian officials say nearly 10,000 people in the northeast of the country have now been
*11:59.780- 12:04.260* :  evacuated from their homes since Russia launched a renewed offensive across the border.
*12:04.840- 12:09.300* :  Klima Zepa, who lives in the city of Harkiv, told the BBC about life there over the last
*12:09.300- 12:10.040* :  couple of days.
*12:10.520- 12:16.900* :  We have attacks of Russian air forces which allow the gliding air bombs from the territory
*12:16.900- 12:23.020* :  of Russia and then they are flying towards Harkiv, like this afternoon, these air bombs,
*12:23.620- 12:28.440* :  I think they were two, they hit the residential area, five wounded, including three kids.
*12:28.980- 12:33.740* :  Yesterday it was quite a lot of casualties, three killed, I think 28 wounded.
*12:34.600- 12:40.080* :  And it was the fire that's strong that we saw the smoke from our balcony and was seen
*12:40.080- 12:41.140* :  from all around the city.
*12:41.860- 12:47.660* :  Alexey Goncharenko, who's Ukrainian MP, who's been in Harkiv this week, said Russia's advances
*12:47.660- 12:51.700* :  were moderate, but he explained how the military tactics are still threatening the city.
*12:52.220- 12:57.080* :  They can't take Harkiv for at least right now, definitely not, and I think in general
*12:57.080- 13:03.240* :  Ukraine had enough capacity to stop them from taking Harkiv, but if they will advance
*13:03.240- 13:09.580* :  close to the city and if the city will be within artillery range, that will cause an
*13:09.700- 13:16.660* :  awful suffering for people because we know Russian warfare, Clay Boog, they will just
*13:16.660- 13:18.240* :  start to destroy the city.
*13:18.760- 13:23.180* :  Our correspondent, Ziana Besbiatchuk, is in Kiev and told me more about what's happening
*13:23.180- 13:25.820* :  in the northeast around the city of Vovchansk.
*13:26.220- 13:30.880* :  The very reports of fighting inside the town of Vovchansk.
*13:31.100- 13:35.820* :  This is a small town nearby the border with Russia, but it's really very important because
*13:35.820- 13:44.000* :  if you imagine and there is a probability of Russian forces advance there and see some
*13:44.000- 13:50.940* :  villages nearby this small town, then it might happen that the Russian forces will be
*13:50.940- 13:57.820* :  able to target the city of Harkiv itself, the second largest in Ukraine with their artillery.
*13:57.940- 14:02.900* :  It won't be even necessary for them to use a long range artillery, it'll be enough to
*14:02.900- 14:09.860* :  use ordinary artillery to target northern outskirts of Harkiv, which happened actually
*14:09.860- 14:17.080* :  already to the city at the beginning of the war, and it was devastating for that part
*14:17.080- 14:18.160* :  of the city.
*14:19.080- 14:24.760* :  Give me a sense of how Harkiv is prepared for this, because as you say, it was very much
*14:24.760- 14:28.760* :  under attack at the beginning of the conflict, but not now for many months.
*14:28.820- 14:32.700* :  How are people preparing for this new situation they're facing?
*14:32.880- 14:37.600* :  As far as I know from my sources in Harkiv, there is no panic.
*14:38.380- 14:43.400* :  It's already a typical situation, Ukrainians they don't panic normally, and the residents
*14:43.400- 14:49.180* :  of Harkiv have gone through so many attacks already since the beginning of the war, so
*14:49.180- 14:54.780* :  it's very difficult to scare these people on the one hand, but on the other hand, there
*14:54.780- 14:59.720* :  is a very clear understanding in Harkiv, and beyond all across the country that this
*14:59.720- 15:06.000* :  particular city is really in a big danger now, and they need very much their reinforcement
*15:06.000- 15:07.480* :  of their defense.
*15:08.300- 15:09.760* :  This is absolutely essential.
*15:10.280- 15:15.480* :  The Ukrainian president of Dmitry Zelensky said it very clearly that Harkiv needs at least
*15:15.480- 15:24.560* :  to patriot a defense system, to intercept Russian missiles and drones, which fly every
*15:24.560- 15:27.180* :  single day and night in disguise over the city.
*15:27.180- 15:33.180* :  Of course, now I think we might predict that there'll be fierce fighting and very big
*15:33.180- 15:40.220* :  battle for other control over the areas around Wolfchansk, because these battles will
*15:40.220- 15:44.560* :  be about the control over the Norse and outskirts of Harkiv.
*15:44.940- 15:46.920* :  Ziana Bespiatchuk with me from Ukraine.
*15:47.780- 15:52.240* :  A close ally of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has vowed never to get
*15:52.240- 15:56.600* :  up the fight against the Russian president Vladimir Putin, despite being badly hurt in
*15:56.600- 15:58.100* :  a hammer attack in Lithuania.
*15:58.620- 16:00.580* :  Leonid Volkov was beaten in March.
*16:01.060- 16:05.640* :  The assault was less than two months after the sudden death of Mr Navalny in an Arctic
*16:05.640- 16:08.300* :  prison, which the Kremlin was widely blamed.
*16:08.820- 16:12.180* :  This report is by Laura Koonsburg, who's been speaking to Mr Volkov.
*16:12.840- 16:15.180* :  Bruce and battered, but not broken.
*16:15.900- 16:19.380* :  Leonid Volkov was assaulted outside his own home in March.
*16:19.900- 16:23.360* :  His car window smashed, his legs attacked with hammers.
*16:23.880- 16:28.940* :  He told me his attacker's message from the Kremlin was, we know where you live, we can
*16:28.940- 16:30.760* :  kill you, we are after you.
*16:31.480- 16:35.760* :  Yet the close friend and colleague of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny
*16:36.260- 16:37.720* :  says he's undetired.
*16:38.160- 16:45.400* :  He asked us to never give up and to defeat Putin and to build this beautiful Russia of
*16:45.400- 16:53.600* :  the futures that Alexei dreamed of for so many years is the only practical way to preserve
*16:53.600- 16:57.840* :  his legacy and to make his ultimate sacrifice not to be in vain.
*16:58.420- 17:03.220* :  Three people were arrested last month over the hammer attack, which Mr Navalny's longtime
*17:03.220- 17:06.880* :  chief of staff believes was ordered by President Putin's regime.
*17:07.600- 17:13.180* :  Mr Volkov told me there had to be military, economic and political pressure on the Kremlin,
*17:13.820- 17:18.780* :  describing Vladimir Putin as the greatest threat to the world in 80 years.
*17:19.960- 17:25.680* :  Ecologists in Costa Rica have completely one of the largest ever eco-acoustic surveys
*17:25.680- 17:27.860* :  by recording the sounds of the forest.
*17:28.520- 17:33.660* :  Traditionally researchers hoping to gauge biodiversity would count species or set up camera
*17:33.660- 17:36.760* :  traps that capture images of animals moving past.
*17:37.360- 17:42.440* :  Now scientists from Switzerland and other teams from Costa Rican universities have been
*17:42.440- 17:47.380* :  listening into ecosystems to hear how they change and to monitor their health.
*17:47.980- 17:50.200* :  Jackamo Delgado was one of the lead researchers.
*17:51.140- 17:55.300* :  What we're really doing is taking the whole collection of sounds from an ecosystem and
*17:55.300- 18:00.560* :  we call this a soundscape and we use this as an indicator of what's happening in the
*18:10.180- 18:10.200* :  forest.
*18:10.300- 18:15.520* :  And by taking the entire collection of sounds, we can tune in to the entire community
*18:15.520- 18:20.720* :  assemblage, the whole congress of species that exists in a place and not just the species
*18:20.900- 18:21.980* :  but even beyond that, right?
*18:21.980- 18:28.140* :  So maybe how the wind sounds like through different types of trees or how the rain lingers
*18:28.200- 18:32.140* :  in certain ecosystems over others and so that whole collection of sounds is really what
*18:32.140- 18:32.700* :  we're after.
*18:33.120- 18:36.940* :  And we use that as the temperature check for what's happening underneath the canopy.
*18:40.800- 18:45.980* :  We kind of think of Costa Rica as the best example for nature recovery that we kind of have.
*18:45.980- 18:50.720* :  They've done this incredible job of bringing back the forest but the only real metric that
*18:50.720- 18:53.900* :  we have of that recovery has been forest cover.
*18:54.160- 18:58.560* :  And so what we were interesting and finding out is beneath the canopy, underneath those
*18:58.560- 19:03.720* :  satellite images of that regrowing forest, is the forest actually recovering in a way
*19:04.120- 19:08.800* :  that makes it more similar to those intact, those reference forests protected in protected
*19:08.800- 19:11.320* :  areas like national parks or conservation areas.
*19:11.640- 19:15.460* :  And so that's what we came to do and our methodology is explicitly comparative in that
*19:15.460- 19:19.860* :  way, trying to see which similarities or which ecosystems are kind of getting closer
*19:26.240- 19:26.320* :  to that reference point.
*19:26.320- 19:28.520* :  The ecologist, Jacka Modalgado there.
*19:31.540- 19:32.280* :  And still to come?
*19:32.720- 19:34.380* :  L'Omesi Olpia contra!
*19:37.200- 19:42.660* :  L'Omesi, one of the world's greatest ever footballers, will find out how a napkin started
*19:42.660- 19:44.060* :  his amazing career.
*19:52.260- 19:53.520* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mid-Mobile.
*19:53.780- 19:57.600* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring
*19:57.600- 19:58.820* :  our prices down.
*19:59.220- 20:03.020* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer which is apparently a thing.

*20:56.860- 20:58.500* :  This is the Global News Podcast.
*20:59.120- 21:03.440* :  The man charged with attempting to assassinate Slovakia's prime minister, Robert Fizzo,
*21:03.840- 21:05.540* :  has appeared in court for the first time.
*21:05.540- 21:10.760* :  The authorities haven't officially identified him, but local media say he is 71-year-old
*21:11.020- 21:11.880* :  Yorai Sintila.
*21:12.240- 21:16.680* :  Meanwhile, doctors treating the prime minister have said he remains in a stable but serious
*21:16.680- 21:19.800* :  condition and that they won't be able to move him for a few days.
*21:20.340- 21:22.720* :  Our correspondent, Bethany Bell, is in Bratislava.
*21:23.220- 21:29.520* :  The health minister said Mr. Fizzo's health seems to have stabilized after surgery.
*21:29.520- 21:33.120* :  He had to remove dead tissue from the gunshot wounds.
*21:33.740- 21:38.800* :  He still said to be in a very serious condition, though, and the deputy prime minister, who
*21:38.800- 21:43.760* :  was also speaking with the health minister, said that it was unlikely that he would be
*21:43.760- 21:50.300* :  moved from the hospital in central Slovakia where he is to Bratislava in the next few
*21:50.320- 21:50.620* :  days.
*21:51.100- 21:56.960* :  But the deputy prime minister did say that they are able to communicate with Mr. Fizzo
*21:57.160- 21:59.560* :  within what he called the limits of his condition.
*22:00.080- 22:04.560* :  We've been hearing a great deal from the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Robert
*22:04.560- 22:07.980* :  Kalinak, as well as a number of other members of the cabinet.
*22:07.980- 22:12.720* :  They say they are meeting all the time and, as they said, they didn't feel it was necessary
*22:12.720- 22:14.620* :  to appoint a caretaker leader.
*22:14.840- 22:22.200* :  There's still an enormous sense of tension, shock and real deep polarisation here, a number
*22:22.200- 22:27.020* :  of politicians from all sides have said they've received death threats.
*22:27.680- 22:32.420* :  There have been mutual accusations of people stirring up hatred.
*22:32.540- 22:40.680* :  The deputy prime minister called on the country to be calm and to be tolerant and also accused
*22:40.860- 22:43.600* :  the opposition and the media of stirring up hatred.
*22:44.140- 22:50.260* :  Critics of the government would say Mr. Fizzo is also very well known for his aggressive
*22:50.320- 22:56.620* :  and very confrontational, polarising style in politics, and a lot of people are very worried
*22:56.620- 23:03.380* :  about how this will play out whatever is determined about the motivations of the gunman.
*23:03.840- 23:08.760* :  They're worried that the polarisation and the divisions in Slovakian society will take
*23:08.760- 23:09.740* :  a long time to heal.
*23:10.300- 23:15.760* :  It's 15 years since the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka, relatives of tens of thousands
*23:15.760- 23:20.660* :  of civilians who died in the long-running conflict, held ceremonies on Saturday to remember
*23:20.660- 23:21.980* :  their loved ones who were killed.
*23:22.480- 23:26.020* :  Many are demanding answers about what happened to those who went missing.
*23:26.580- 23:29.760* :  Sri Lankan military has always denied killing civilians.
*23:30.440- 23:35.320* :  Here's the sound of a Hindu religious ceremony in the village of Mollivikal where many people
*23:43.840- 23:44.000* :  died in the final phase of the offensive.
*23:44.000- 23:48.280* :  My colleague Janan Chalil spoke to our South Asia regional editor and barrison, Etha Rajan,
*23:48.560- 23:50.680* :  and asked for more on the history of the conflict.
*23:50.980- 23:56.440* :  Sri Lanka's Tamil tiger rebels fought for a separate homeland for the minority Tamil,
*23:56.440- 23:59.620* :  so predominantly lived in the north and east of the country.
*24:00.160- 24:04.740* :  The war lasted for nearly 30 years and in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
*24:04.760- 24:11.380* :  Especially the final few months of the conflict in 2009 were quite brutal and the international
*24:11.380- 24:16.220* :  community and the rights group are accusing Sri Lankan photos of indiscriminately bombing
*24:16.220- 24:16.980* :  civil and areas.
*24:16.980- 24:20.260* :  I was in the front line for days during this war.
*24:20.260- 24:25.340* :  We saw how many villages were damaged, people living in refugee camps.
*24:25.940- 24:28.500* :  And since then, the relatives of those killed.
*24:28.500- 24:33.520* :  They have been assembling in this small fishing hamlet Mollivikal in northeast of Sri Lanka.
*24:33.900- 24:38.960* :  We heard the song from there how thousands of people had gathered to remember those dead.
*24:39.460- 24:44.400* :  And this is a very poignant reminder for those relatives who were killed and also people
*24:44.400- 24:48.200* :  who went missing after the war and they are still seeking justice.
*24:48.980- 24:50.780* :  Yes, they're still seeking justice.
*24:50.780- 24:52.980* :  What is the government doing to help them?
*24:54.060- 24:58.820* :  Now the government says they set up various commissions, various projects to reach out
*24:58.820- 24:59.900* :  to the Tamil community.
*24:59.900- 25:05.660* :  But on the other hand, what the Tamil are saying is that what they were aspiring for a political
*25:05.660- 25:11.220* :  solution, they were giving more autonomy to the Tamil areas they have not yet materialized.
*25:11.540- 25:14.860* :  But biggest complaint is about thousands of people who went to missing.
*25:14.860- 25:18.880* :  Some of them they say they surrendered to the military after the war.
*25:19.240- 25:20.700* :  So what happened to them?
*25:20.900- 25:25.920* :  So unless you get justice, then reconciliation is not possible.
*25:25.920- 25:28.180* :  This is the argument of the Tamil community.
*25:28.180- 25:33.940* :  On the other hand, the UN and other agencies have been putting pressure on the Sri Lankan
*25:33.940- 25:39.200* :  to government to conduct an investigation and then put responsibility, accountability for
*25:39.200- 25:44.140* :  those allegedly carried out these killings and also disappearances.
*25:44.500- 25:48.860* :  But the Sri Lankan government and security forces have always denied that they were responsible
*25:48.860- 25:55.040* :  and they blame the Tamil Tigers for using the civilians as human shoes and that led to
*25:55.360- 25:55.860* :  these deaths.
*25:56.740- 26:00.520* :  There are less than two weeks to go until the general election in South Africa.
*26:00.980- 26:04.960* :  And the former president, Jacob Zuma, has launched his new parties manifesto.
*26:05.200- 26:10.260* :  He chose stadium in Johannesburg to announce his plans, despite still awaiting a court decision
*26:10.720- 26:15.420* :  about whether his name can be on the ballot papers for the MK party that he recently founded.
*26:15.940- 26:18.880* :  Our Africa editor, Will Ross told me more about today's rally.
*26:19.340- 26:23.180* :  It was a kind of party atmosphere in this stadium, lots of musicians.
*26:23.900- 26:27.940* :  Jacob Zuma also is singing as he often does at these kinds of rallies.
*26:28.680- 26:33.720* :  And he talked about these elections being a time to change South Africa and make it a country
*26:33.720- 26:34.600* :  for everyone.
*26:34.820- 26:40.180* :  He gave a bit of a history of a part eight and talked about his role, mobilizing during
*26:40.180- 26:40.900* :  a part eight.
*26:41.220- 26:45.900* :  Then he talked about changes that his party wanted to make to the education system to help
*26:45.900- 26:46.720* :  create jobs.
*26:47.300- 26:51.960* :  And he talked generally about fixing South Africa's poverty challenges, but he didn't really
*26:52.520- 26:55.400* :  set out a manifesto in clear steps.
*26:55.400- 27:00.520* :  He actually quite surprisingly said after the election, the MK party would gather South
*27:00.520- 27:04.820* :  Africans together and get them to help the party come up with policies, which was
*27:04.820- 27:10.020* :  somewhat surprising, but it was more a kind of moment to make a bit of a splash and
*27:10.020- 27:12.380* :  get himself in the news and a Philistadium.
*27:12.600- 27:16.740* :  We're talking about the court battle, but also interested to know whether the MK party
*27:16.740- 27:20.660* :  can actually do any damage to the ANC, his former party.
*27:20.960- 27:26.200* :  Yes, so it's slightly complicated in that there have been over the years now two parties
*27:26.200- 27:30.620* :  that have broken away from the ANC, the economic freedom fighters as well.
*27:31.320- 27:37.360* :  And polls aren't that reliable, but there has been some suggestion that for the first
*27:37.360- 27:43.640* :  time, the ANC may not get over the 50% mark, meaning that it would be forced to go into
*27:43.640- 27:44.900* :  some kind of a coalition.
*27:45.480- 27:50.040* :  It's still likely to get the highest number of votes by far, and it's still a bit of an
*27:50.040- 27:53.700* :  unknown as to how many votes this MK party can garner.
*27:53.700- 27:59.240* :  It's obviously very popular in Quazulina Tau, Jacob Zuma's home area, but it's a bit
*27:59.240- 28:04.160* :  of an unknown as to how many people are going to move their votes away from the ANC.
*28:04.160- 28:07.460* :  And just a bit wet on this legal battle that's still there.
*28:07.780- 28:13.480* :  Well, it's still a legal battle as to whether Jacob Zuma's name will appear on the ballot
*28:13.480- 28:17.060* :  paper or at least allow him to stand as a candidate for parliament.
*28:17.060- 28:21.120* :  It's a proportional representation system, but that's still in the courts.
*28:21.120- 28:25.720* :  And of course, he also has a longstanding corruption trial hanging over his head.
*28:26.220- 28:32.100* :  African editor Will Ross with me 25 years ago, fans of the original Star Wars trilogy
*28:32.100- 28:37.840* :  flocked to the cinema to watch the much anticipated prequel, episode 1, The Phantom Menace.
*28:38.300- 28:43.440* :  The George Lucas film introduced the well-meaning but clumsy alien character, Jar Jar Binks,
*28:43.440- 28:44.680* :  played by Ahmed Best.
*28:45.260- 28:50.100* :  His performance sparked plenty of online criticism, taking the actor to what he described
*28:50.100- 28:51.800* :  as a very dark place.
*28:52.460- 28:56.080* :  Now Ahmed Best has come to accept and celebrate his role in the franchise.
*28:56.100- 28:58.700* :  He's been talking to my colleague, Judy Morica.
*28:59.560- 29:06.620* :  I got the call to go to Leavesden, England and be in Phantom Menace.
*29:06.980- 29:09.400* :  I really still didn't know what I was doing.
*29:09.580- 29:10.700* :  I knew it was something different.
*29:10.700- 29:17.440* :  I knew it had to do with this new way of making digital characters, which had never been
*29:17.440- 29:24.440* :  done before, using a hybrid computer-generated imaging live-action character.
*29:24.840- 29:28.780* :  And no one shared anything with me until it was time to actually go.
*29:29.040- 29:31.600* :  Talk to me about the reaction that you then got.
*29:32.200- 29:42.300* :  There were a lot of people who wanted those movies to be all Sith Lord, all dark, all action
*29:42.340- 29:42.680* :  movies.
*29:42.980- 29:48.140* :  The demographic for the Phantom Menace was young people.
*29:48.880- 29:53.560* :  And Jar Jar Binks was like the perfect lightning rod for their disappointment.
*29:53.860- 29:59.420* :  When Jar Jar came out, he wasn't very well received by popular culture.
*29:59.760- 30:05.020* :  What's puzzling about that is that people might decide to take against a character for
*30:05.020- 30:10.000* :  the reasons that you've just described, but they took against you, too, didn't they?
*30:10.000- 30:10.320* :  Yeah.
*30:10.820- 30:17.800* :  The eyeer that came towards me was one that I definitely wasn't prepared for, especially
*30:17.860- 30:18.680* :  at that time.
*30:18.720- 30:22.840* :  I was in my mid-20s, and it was my very first movie.
*30:23.500- 30:28.080* :  And I was so excited about being able to be a part of film history.
*30:28.880- 30:34.740* :  And because of the backlash that happened against me specifically, I wasn't able to continue
*30:34.740- 30:35.160* :  that work.
*30:35.300- 30:37.800* :  And it threw me into a very, very deep depression at the time.
*30:38.320- 30:42.960* :  And because there was no such thing as cyberbullying and online harassment, there was really
*30:42.960- 30:46.060* :  nowhere I could go for any kind of help.
*30:46.820- 30:52.840* :  So I just retreated into my little one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn and didn't want to
*30:52.880- 30:53.140* :  come out.
*30:53.380- 30:56.180* :  What got you out the other side of all of that?
*30:56.660- 30:56.940* :  Yeah.
*30:57.760- 31:05.660* :  It wasn't easy where I found myself standing on the edge of the Brooklyn Bridge and wanting
*31:05.660- 31:08.580* :  to, you know, not go on.
*31:09.500- 31:18.480* :  And if it wasn't for just, you know, a moment of clarity in that instance, I might not
*31:18.480- 31:19.460* :  even be here today.
*31:20.060- 31:25.080* :  It was this real kind of like rock bottom moment where I had to go.
*31:25.780- 31:27.880* :  You have a lot more in you.
*31:28.000- 31:29.460* :  You have a lot more art in you.
*31:29.460- 31:30.720* :  This isn't the end.
*31:31.440- 31:32.620* :  And you can go on.
*31:33.220- 31:40.280* :  Here we are 25 years on and you've talked with great candor about the impact playing
*31:40.280- 31:43.200* :  this part had on you and everything you went through afterwards.
*31:44.060- 31:48.220* :  But you're obviously now still very proud that you did this, yeah?
*31:48.660- 31:49.320* :  Incredibly.
*31:50.060- 31:56.320* :  Regardless of what my mental state was at the time and where I was, it's always been
*31:56.320- 31:59.220* :  about the work and it's always been about the pride and the work.
*31:59.860- 32:05.840* :  And we all knew while we were doing it, that we were doing something special and we
*32:05.840- 32:09.360* :  were doing something groundbreaking and that pride has never gone away.
*32:10.180- 32:15.420* :  This time was like to arm out best with Julian Warrake and napkin with a promise written
*32:15.420- 32:20.700* :  on it from Barcelona football club to sign Lionel Messi has been sold at auction for
*32:20.700- 32:21.840* :  nearly a million dollars.
*32:22.440- 32:27.020* :  Officials from Barcelona agreed to the deal while visiting a tennis club in December
*32:27.780- 32:27.800* :  2000.
*32:28.360- 32:31.080* :  Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss has the story.
*32:31.460- 32:36.960* :  The auction house described the item on sale as a standard Spanish waxy napkin.
*32:37.320- 32:41.360* :  Though it's safe to say the buyer is unlikely to use it to wipe their mouth.
*32:41.820- 32:47.060* :  It carries a written commitment from Barcelona football clubs then sporting director that
*32:47.060- 32:50.200* :  he'll sign the 13 year old player Lionel Messi.
*32:50.200- 32:55.640* :  The commitment was then witnessed by the club's transfer advisor and an Argentinian football
*32:55.640- 33:01.120* :  agent and it's seen as marking the start of what would become a phenomenally successful
*33:01.120- 33:01.680* :  career.
*33:05.960- 33:10.580* :  It's still not known who paid £762,000 for the napkin.
*33:11.060- 33:15.660* :  For some it'll be seen as evidence of the devotion Lionel Messi still inspires.
*33:16.320- 33:21.220* :  For others, proof that when it comes to top level football, crazy amounts of money will
*33:21.220- 33:26.500* :  follow not just the stars themselves, but even any artefacts associated with their
*33:26.600- 33:26.920* :  playing.
