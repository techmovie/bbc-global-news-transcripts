*01:21.020- 01:24.820* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 18th of May,
*01:25.300- 01:28.140* :  we hear from the incredibly courageous Georgia Laurie,
*01:28.140- 01:32.300* :  who repeatedly punched a crocodile to save her twin sister Melissa.
*01:32.860- 01:35.200* :  Her bravery has been recognised by King Charles.
*01:35.900- 01:39.560* :  When you think about it now, it's kind of like a superhero move,
*01:39.740- 01:42.260* :  but you know what, I just had no other choice.
*01:42.860- 01:45.000* :  I couldn't live with myself if I'd left.
*01:45.000- 01:47.760* :  I mean, it would have to have taken someone to drag me away.
*01:48.800- 01:52.100* :  Meet the brothers taking on the world one jig at a time.
*01:52.840- 01:55.480* :  You know, that's something that we love about our dancing and our style
*01:55.480- 02:00.300* :  is that we are so one sink and we love that, you know, dancing as brothers is great.
*02:01.540- 02:04.340* :  What happens if you let children run their own school?
*02:04.340- 02:07.780* :  We go to one revolutionary school in Thailand to find out.
*02:08.440- 02:10.940* :  The school was not to be producing good, decent people
*02:11.520- 02:16.260* :  to make a better human being, not just to be able to read and write past exams,
*02:16.980- 02:19.500* :  take know as a question, never know as a dancer.
*02:20.280- 02:22.380* :  Also in this podcast, by Stevie Wonder,
*02:22.380- 02:25.660* :  thought it was wonderful to become a citizen of Ghana and...
*02:25.980- 02:31.980* :  Oh, gosh. I don't think there's actually words that can describe how I felt
*02:31.980- 02:34.200* :  when we realised it was actually going to happen.
*02:34.840- 02:38.580* :  House, then, the reindeer was saved from a broken heart.
*02:43.900- 02:47.600* :  We begin with the inspiring story of a woman who risked her own life
*02:47.600- 02:49.860* :  to save her twin sister from a crocodile.
*02:50.600- 02:54.660* :  Georgia and Melissa Laurie were swimming in a lagoon in Mexico three years ago
*02:54.660- 02:56.760* :  when Melissa was dragged underwater.
*02:57.640- 03:01.760* :  Georgia repeatedly punched the crocodile as it attacked her sister three times
*03:01.760- 03:04.640* :  before they were finally called to safety on a boat.
*03:04.740- 03:10.220* :  They were both treated in hospital and Melissa even had to be put into a medically-induced coma.
*03:11.080- 03:13.960* :  But thankfully, they've both made a full recovery,
*03:13.960- 03:20.500* :  and now Georgia is being honoured for her bravery in King Charles' first civilian gallantry list.
*03:21.200- 03:24.160* :  Georgia started by telling me about the moment they realised
*03:24.160- 03:28.220* :  there was a crocodile in the lagoon that they'd been told was safe.
*03:29.100- 03:32.300* :  We all saw it swimming frantically away and, you know,
*03:32.320- 03:36.480* :  that feeling of sheer terror, I can't explain it to you.
*03:36.480- 03:38.000* :  It was petrifying.
*03:38.880- 03:41.660* :  You could feel the peril of all of us.
*03:42.180- 03:45.200* :  The atmosphere was just very dense with it.
*03:45.820- 03:48.500* :  So, yeah, we just swam away as quickly as possible.
*03:49.020- 03:51.380* :  And then the next thing I heard was Melissa screaming
*03:51.380- 03:55.460* :  because she'd been taken under water by the crocodile when it attacked her.
*03:56.060- 04:00.560* :  Honestly, I thought that she was dead and my whole world just collapsed.
*04:00.960- 04:03.880* :  It felt like the bond between us had been severed.
*04:04.240- 04:08.160* :  I mean, honestly, I wanted to get as far away as possible from the danger.
*04:08.160- 04:11.540* :  I know that might sound quite selfish, but I think that's just quite a fact.
*04:11.540- 04:14.480* :  Not at all. I mean, I think a lot of people would understand that feeling.
*04:14.480- 04:18.360* :  What I think a lot of people find quite remarkable about your behaviour
*04:18.360- 04:21.500* :  was that you went back and you fought off that crocodile.
*04:22.080- 04:25.460* :  Yeah, I mean, you know, when you think about it now,
*04:25.500- 04:29.120* :  it's kind of like a superhero move, but you know what,
*04:29.120- 04:30.740* :  I just had no other choice.
*04:31.300- 04:33.460* :  I couldn't live with myself if I had left.
*04:33.520- 04:36.260* :  I mean, it would have to have taken someone to drag me away.
*04:36.720- 04:39.320* :  So, Melissa, what was going through your mind when you were attacked?
*04:40.000- 04:43.720* :  I had these thoughts entering my mind that no one wants in their final moments.
*04:43.760- 04:46.880* :  Like, I'm never going to see my friends and family again.
*04:47.740- 04:50.500* :  I just thought, you know, what a horrible way to go.
*04:50.500- 04:54.160* :  Like, I never thought I would die from a crocodile attack.
*04:54.500- 04:56.480* :  And you must be very proud of Georgia,
*04:56.880- 04:59.680* :  and she's now getting this King's gallantry medal.
*05:00.160- 05:01.840* :  Oh, I'm incredibly proud.
*05:02.540- 05:06.860* :  For Georgia to have risked her life like that.
*05:07.660- 05:10.880* :  You know, she didn't know what she was going to come across
*05:10.940- 05:12.260* :  when she went back into the water.
*05:12.260- 05:15.520* :  It could have been not one crocodile, but two.
*05:15.900- 05:18.240* :  It's so brave of her, so courageous.
*05:19.260- 05:22.760* :  And Georgia, having survived this, come through this together,
*05:23.600- 05:26.600* :  has this experience made the bond between you stronger
*05:26.600- 05:31.340* :  because you talked about how, at the moment, when you saw Melissa being dragged away
*05:31.340- 05:33.960* :  by the crocodile, you felt as if the bond had been severed,
*05:33.960- 05:36.140* :  but has it now become instead stronger?
*05:37.040- 05:39.260* :  Yeah, most definitely, we're much stronger.
*05:39.260- 05:42.740* :  And I think we're very lucky in the fact that we have this shared experience.
*05:42.740- 05:45.300* :  So, when things get a little tough,
*05:45.620- 05:46.940* :  we can just be in each other's company.
*05:46.940- 05:50.160* :  We don't even have to say anything to know and understand
*05:50.160- 05:51.460* :  what each other are feeling.
*05:52.160- 05:54.760* :  It's just a very special bond that twins have that.
*05:55.520- 05:58.040* :  It certainly makes you appreciate what you have
*05:58.040- 06:02.260* :  and whom you have in your life for that expression.
*06:02.260- 06:04.620* :  You don't know what you've got until you've lost it.
*06:05.600- 06:08.120* :  And Melissa, once Georgia got you onto the boat,
*06:08.160- 06:10.240* :  she found another way to help you survive.
*06:10.960- 06:12.820* :  Georgia did something so beautiful.
*06:12.820- 06:17.600* :  She started singing, stand by me, and three little birds.
*06:18.540- 06:21.020* :  And she just sung that on repeat.
*06:21.840- 06:27.700* :  And I could feel myself trying with all of my might to stay connected to her.
*06:28.060- 06:31.880* :  And I believe that that's the main reason that I'm here today.
*06:32.640- 06:33.620* :  I couldn't give up.
*06:34.140- 06:36.860* :  I think I just wanted to give her something to focus on
*06:36.860- 06:38.960* :  other than the pain that she was feeling.
*06:38.960- 06:41.560* :  I just wanted to give her a melody to focus on
*06:42.200- 06:44.300* :  rather than the thoughts that may be running through her head.
*06:44.300- 06:48.480* :  And actually it was comforting for me as well.
*06:49.460- 06:51.900* :  I didn't believe that she was going to make it.
*06:51.900- 06:56.380* :  So if there was anything that she was going to hear in her last moments,
*06:56.380- 06:59.300* :  I wanted it to be the comfort of my voice.
*07:00.100- 07:03.500* :  I've always been Georgia's number one fan when it comes to her singing.
*07:03.500- 07:07.120* :  I think she's got such a lovely voice.
*07:08.280- 07:11.740* :  And hearing it, it really did help remind me
*07:11.740- 07:16.460* :  of what I was fighting for for the life that we share together
*07:16.460- 07:19.800* :  and all the years that we've got left to live.
*07:20.340- 07:22.400* :  You're much stronger than you think you are.
*07:23.500- 07:28.740* :  Everybody has this incredible strength inside them that they can tap into.
*07:30.680- 07:32.420* :  Georgia and Melissa Laurie.
*07:33.940- 07:35.140* :  Take a listen to this.
*07:43.480- 07:47.240* :  That tapping you can hear is a work of Matthew and Michael Gardner.
*07:47.640- 07:49.000* :  Known as the Gardner brothers,
*07:49.000- 07:52.680* :  they've taken the internet and their millions of followers by storm
*07:52.680- 07:54.580* :  with their Irish dancing videos.
*07:55.380- 07:57.720* :  Matthew and Michael were actually born in the US
*07:57.720- 08:01.580* :  to Irish parents who wanted to instill their culture in their children
*08:01.580- 08:03.980* :  and they did it through the medium of dance.
*08:04.220- 08:06.260* :  Harry Blie has been speaking to the brothers.
*08:07.140- 08:11.640* :  We always had a goal and a vision to post our dancing on social media.
*08:12.140- 08:15.180* :  The very first video that went up of us dancing was the video
*08:15.500- 08:17.120* :  that we performed at a wedding, actually.
*08:17.600- 08:19.660* :  We were performing to Michael Jackson's smooth criminal.
*08:26.320- 08:29.860* :  The woman that was attending the wedding posted the video and at God.
*08:29.900- 08:31.840* :  I think it got about 44,000 shares,
*08:31.840- 08:33.540* :  which at the time was enormous.
*08:34.020- 08:36.060* :  To fast forward to the pandemic,
*08:36.780- 08:38.220* :  Michael was on tour with River Dance
*08:38.260- 08:39.560* :  and I was finishing my degree.
*08:40.120- 08:41.180* :  We had a bit of lost time.
*08:41.180- 08:45.440* :  So we started creating different choreographies to the likes of Michael Jackson again
*08:45.440- 08:50.100* :  and Eminem, Ed Sheeran, ACDC, I mean, you name it.
*08:50.220- 08:52.540* :  And to Beatles, we started posting it online
*08:52.640- 08:54.840* :  and it just, it brought people joy
*08:55.360- 08:57.760* :  and it really just started to grow and grow and grow.
*08:58.360- 08:59.880* :  Which is your favorite video?
*08:59.880- 09:02.420* :  What's been the most enjoyable one to not only make,
*09:02.420- 09:04.700* :  but to get the reaction from the viewers?
*09:05.340- 09:08.280* :  It's a tough question because we love them all.
*09:08.280- 09:11.460* :  It's like, I was trying to pick our favorite child or something.
*09:12.020- 09:14.420* :  I think for me, the first one that comes to mind
*09:14.420- 09:18.580* :  is a video that we did to Tulsa Time by Don Williams.
*09:18.720- 09:21.960* :  And it's a little bit of an unusual song and choice, I suppose.
*09:32.620- 09:34.500* :  We traveled all the way to Tulsa, Oklahoma
*09:34.500- 09:37.280* :  and we got to put our cowboy hats back on
*09:37.900- 09:40.860* :  and it was almost like we were young kids again pretending to be cowboys.
*09:40.860- 09:43.520* :  But we were able to make line dancing
*09:43.520- 09:45.300* :  and our Irish dancing together,
*09:45.300- 09:47.060* :  which is another thing that we love to do.
*09:47.060- 09:50.420* :  We love to show that you can mix the different styles of dancing with it.
*09:50.580- 09:52.500* :  I think my favorite one would have been the Bee Gees.
*09:52.540- 09:54.940* :  We did stay in a live and it was just so much fun.
*10:03.940- 10:06.100* :  It's a much slower tune than what we're used to dancing to.
*10:06.100- 10:07.340* :  But again, we love the challenge.
*10:08.040- 10:09.240* :  I mean, both great songs.
*10:09.340- 10:10.820* :  I've got to say, I'm a fan of both.
*10:11.360- 10:13.480* :  A big question now, your choreography.
*10:13.800- 10:15.540* :  The question that everyone's thinking is,
*10:15.540- 10:18.400* :  how do you both stay in sync?
*10:18.700- 10:21.300* :  That's something that we love about our dancing and our style
*10:21.300- 10:26.120* :  is that we are so in sync and we love that dancing as brothers is great.
*10:26.680- 10:28.680* :  We just put the music on, we listen to it a few times
*10:28.680- 10:30.800* :  and then we just throw in some moves around.
*10:31.460- 10:34.440* :  Yeah, I think it really starts with a little bit of that,
*10:34.840- 10:38.200* :  a little bit of just jamming out to the music and then both of us sit down
*10:38.200- 10:41.500* :  and we do like to break down the music into its different layers.
*10:41.940- 10:44.560* :  We've learned over the years to hear all these different accents
*10:44.560- 10:48.220* :  even though they might be happening all at different times with different instruments.
*10:48.220- 10:51.100* :  And as Michael said earlier about dancing to the Bee Gees,
*10:51.420- 10:53.740* :  then we might try and get in something, you know,
*10:53.740- 10:57.220* :  some disco moves or some more retro hip-hop moves.
*10:57.560- 11:01.200* :  I'm intrigued that your journey starts all the way in Denver, Colorado.
*11:02.080- 11:05.160* :  What does Irish Dance mean to both of you?
*11:05.160- 11:07.660* :  And when you're dancing, how does it make you feel?
*11:07.660- 11:09.520* :  Because it's not just a hobby that you had when you were a kid.
*11:09.520- 11:13.160* :  You've both made enormously successful careers out of it.
*11:13.680- 11:16.280* :  In the 90s, obviously, River Dance hit the world
*11:17.000- 11:20.740* :  and I think it had an enormous impact on the entire world
*11:20.740- 11:23.520* :  because everybody wanted to have that little slice of Ireland.
*11:24.120- 11:26.340* :  It's something that Irish people are incredibly proud about
*11:26.340- 11:29.480* :  because we have our own thing that's ours, I guess.
*11:29.480- 11:30.820* :  It's our own little art form.
*11:31.300- 11:33.840* :  That's part of our motivation and part of our mission
*11:33.840- 11:37.240* :  is to showcase that to the world, to continue showing it
*11:37.720- 11:39.380* :  and to push it forward, push the boundaries
*11:39.380- 11:42.860* :  and see where we can take our distancing in this next generation.
*11:43.380- 11:46.060* :  Matthew and Michael Gardner speaking to Harry Bly.
*11:47.300- 11:49.760* :  Now, if you could invent a new kind of school,
*11:49.760- 11:52.580* :  what skills would you teach dancing perhaps?
*11:53.180- 11:53.960* :  And how would it be run?
*11:54.600- 11:57.020* :  Well, one school in Thailand has found success
*11:57.020- 12:01.020* :  by handing almost total control to the children.
*12:01.760- 12:07.100* :  The Mechai Bamboo School was founded by the campaigner Mechai Viravajya in 2008.
*12:07.500- 12:09.300* :  It's free to attend, but every year,
*12:09.300- 12:13.860* :  students and their families must do 800 hours of community service
*12:13.860- 12:15.960* :  and plant 800 trees.
*12:16.760- 12:18.760* :  William Kramer went along to find out more.
*12:20.180- 12:21.800* :  So it's 25 plus six in the morning
*12:22.540- 12:25.200* :  and all the students are just streaming into their kind of
*12:25.820- 12:29.580* :  assembly hall space, which is really a magnificent
*12:30.680- 12:35.760* :  dome structure made out of bamboo with a corrugated metal roof.
*12:38.380- 12:40.880* :  You might think that asking children to run a school
*12:41.120- 12:43.140* :  is a bit like asking convicts to run a prison.
*12:43.880- 12:45.640* :  Chaos is likely to ensue.
*12:46.940- 12:49.640* :  But the bamboo school is the very opposite of chaotic.
*12:49.640- 12:53.700* :  It's a very orderly, calm place where the children are polite
*12:54.340- 12:55.800* :  and typically go on to university.
*12:58.500- 13:02.020* :  All 150 children at the school sit cross-legged on the floor
*13:02.280- 13:03.320* :  and say a prayer together.
*13:03.840- 13:07.100* :  Then the students all line up and about six of them take the register
*13:07.600- 13:10.560* :  and check everyone's hands are clean and their uniforms tidy.
*13:11.980- 13:14.360* :  Twice a week, three children go to the market
*13:14.360- 13:17.760* :  and they buy food for all 150 students at the school.
*13:18.840- 13:22.780* :  After they bring it back, it gets carefully checked by another set of students.
*13:24.500- 13:25.360* :  My name is Nguyen Nguyen.
*13:25.680- 13:27.200* :  I'm head of all this.
*13:29.480- 13:31.760* :  I am interested in accounting to begin with,
*13:32.320- 13:33.640* :  so I get excited by it.
*13:34.080- 13:35.880* :  My old school was like this.
*13:36.460- 13:39.960* :  Here I get to try so many things, gain real-world experience
*13:39.960- 13:42.640* :  and work on my leadership skills with my friends.
*13:43.300- 13:46.200* :  There's also a business committee which provides loans to students
*13:46.200- 13:47.500* :  to start their own companies.
*13:48.360- 13:51.600* :  And perhaps most radical of all, a recruitment committee
*13:52.000- 13:53.740* :  which interviews prospective students.
*13:56.760- 13:58.560* :  In a recent interview with a young boy,
*13:58.840- 14:00.780* :  the kids took turns to ask questions
*14:01.400- 14:03.260* :  and the atmosphere was warm and encouraging.
*14:04.420- 14:07.720* :  Recruitment panels consist of six students and two teachers.
*14:08.420- 14:10.000* :  Everyone's views are treated equally.
*14:10.600- 14:12.140* :  They interview staff too.
*14:12.700- 14:14.380* :  For founder Michai Veravigia,
*14:14.700- 14:15.900* :  that makes perfect sense.
*14:16.500- 14:17.880* :  They also evaluate teachers
*14:18.620- 14:20.680* :  and that's what their evaluation goes towards
*14:21.180- 14:23.240* :  salary increase on a yearly basis.
*14:23.640- 14:26.160* :  If you select your teachers, you better look after them.
*14:26.460- 14:28.800* :  You know, after all the who's the beneficiary,
*14:29.260- 14:32.060* :  who's the receptionist, the students, they must have a say.
*14:32.400- 14:36.240* :  Every child has two hours of community service every week.
*14:36.640- 14:39.800* :  I found myself with five children in a local hospital.
*14:41.640- 14:46.180* :  There's a big kind of waiting area with maybe 50 or 60 people waiting for an appointment.
*14:46.780- 14:50.620* :  So we come and play some songs to cheer their heart up
*14:50.740- 14:52.780* :  because they come to the hospitals,
*14:53.500- 14:55.060* :  they are worried and a lot of stress.
*14:55.340- 14:58.440* :  That's why we just want to make them relax and get some
*14:58.840- 15:00.940* :  chair up from playing ukulele.
*15:01.400- 15:04.620* :  I believe that the school is not to be producing good decent people
*15:05.200- 15:08.680* :  to make a better human being, not just to be able to read and write
*15:09.240- 15:10.060* :  past exams.
*15:10.820- 15:12.560* :  In our school, we want people to be honest.
*15:13.160- 15:13.960* :  They're willing to share.
*15:14.860- 15:16.660* :  And they take know as a question.
*15:17.340- 15:18.380* :  Never know as an answer.
*15:19.040- 15:22.800* :  So if you ask questions, someone says no, then you must ask again.
*15:23.300- 15:24.620* :  Maybe I asked the wrong question.
*15:25.000- 15:26.300* :  Maybe you're using a number of backgrounds.
*15:26.740- 15:27.460* :  So don't give up.
*15:28.140- 15:31.180* :  Misha Vera-Vagia ending that report by William Kramer
*15:31.180- 15:33.340* :  with an important lesson for us all.
*15:33.880- 15:35.940* :  And if you'd like to hear more about this unusual school,
*15:36.100- 15:37.960* :  listen to people fixing the world,
*15:38.140- 15:39.300* :  wherever you get your podcasts.
*15:40.420- 15:42.380* :  And talking of schools, on the last episode,
*15:42.380- 15:44.820* :  we asked for your stories of remarkable teachers
*15:44.820- 15:46.660* :  who've made a big difference in your life
*15:46.660- 15:49.480* :  in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week in the US.
*15:50.320- 15:51.500* :  Well, Timothy got in touch.
*15:51.660- 15:54.480* :  He is originally from Italy, but now lives in the United States
*15:54.480- 15:56.920* :  and credits the kindness of a former teacher
*15:57.540- 16:01.040* :  with not only changing, but saving his life.
*16:01.780- 16:05.540* :  Here is a story about a teacher who made a big difference in my life.
*16:06.740- 16:08.600* :  It was the last year of high school.
*16:09.480- 16:11.020* :  Her name is Attila Sioroni.
*16:11.540- 16:13.340* :  She was my literature teacher.
*16:14.200- 16:16.420* :  And it was a very dark place in my life
*16:16.420- 16:19.900* :  where things were not so good at home.
*16:19.900- 16:26.000* :  I thought I reached the end of my path.
*16:26.800- 16:29.640* :  And she just sat down next to me
*16:29.640- 16:31.600* :  on the front stairs of the school
*16:31.660- 16:36.440* :  and told me you shouldn't listen so much to your parents.
*16:36.440- 16:38.540* :  You shouldn't worry so much about them.
*16:39.480- 16:42.040* :  They really don't need you to take care of them.
*16:42.500- 16:45.420* :  Now is your chance to go out in the world
*16:46.100- 16:48.540* :  and make a difference and enjoy your life
*16:48.880- 16:50.040* :  and make it a happy one.
*16:50.880- 16:52.780* :  And just those simple words
*16:52.840- 16:55.640* :  gave me the courage to look ahead.
*16:56.740- 16:58.720* :  Move out of my parents' house,
*16:58.980- 17:01.560* :  which, if you know, in Italy is quite rare
*17:01.680- 17:04.300* :  with all the mamones staying with their parents
*17:05.140- 17:07.360* :  until they're in their midlife.
*17:08.180- 17:09.480* :  And I managed to move to Rome
*17:09.480- 17:12.460* :  and then found the courage to move all the way to California.
*17:13.240- 17:14.960* :  And here I am talking to you today
*17:15.280- 17:17.740* :  where it could have all ended in 1998.
*17:18.720- 17:21.240* :  So thank you, Attila, for everything you've done
*17:21.240- 17:23.740* :  and the inspiration that you have provided
*17:24.560- 17:25.420* :  later on in life.
*17:26.680- 17:30.100* :  Timothy, with his story of how a simple act of kindness
*17:30.620- 17:32.420* :  can make a huge difference.
*17:32.960- 17:34.480* :  If you'd like to tell us about a teacher

*17:54.840- 17:55.820* :  You can't ask for a bit of team.
*17:55.980- 17:57.500* :  Maybe we've all the downs last season.
*17:57.620- 17:58.900* :  You know, they keep on smiling.
*17:59.200- 18:02.040* :  It was unbelievable and it was very exciting.
*18:02.760- 18:06.400* :  The girls football team who went from losing every match last season
*18:06.540- 18:09.740* :  to a 28-game winning streak.
*18:18.780- 18:20.000* :  When it comes to your finances,

*19:35.580- 19:38.860* :  A few weeks ago we brought you the story of Jamel and Tsar,
*19:39.120- 19:41.340* :  two lions born in captivity in Ukraine
*19:41.340- 19:45.180* :  who were at last enjoying a new life in South Africa.
*19:45.880- 19:48.880* :  Well, another family of lions rescued from Ukraine
*19:49.020- 19:51.400* :  have also been settling into a new home,
*19:51.700- 19:53.380* :  this time here in the UK.
*19:54.100- 19:56.660* :  Issa and her three 18-month-old Cubs,
*19:56.860- 19:58.240* :  Emmy, Santa and Teddy,
*19:58.680- 20:00.240* :  were rescued from the Donetsk region
*20:00.240- 20:02.520* :  and spent nine months at a sanctuary in Poland
*20:03.040- 20:05.120* :  where the youngsters were separated from their mother
*20:05.120- 20:06.660* :  and unable to go outside.
*20:07.420- 20:09.540* :  They arrived in Northern England in March
*20:09.540- 20:12.000* :  and have spent the last two months in rehabilitation
*20:12.020- 20:15.440* :  before being released into a special enclosure.
*20:16.180- 20:18.560* :  Colin Northcott from Yorkshire Wildlife Park
*20:18.940- 20:21.980* :  says he felt like a parent taking their child to school
*20:22.200- 20:23.060* :  for the first time.
*20:23.600- 20:26.080* :  A whole range of emotions going through my mind.
*20:26.240- 20:27.760* :  Excitement, apprehension,
*20:28.440- 20:30.140* :  just feel like a prey down at the moment
*20:30.940- 20:32.620* :  by those staff, but yeah,
*20:32.620- 20:35.140* :  my connection with these animals is really quite close
*20:35.160- 20:37.220* :  and I feel really, really chuffed to bits.
*20:37.860- 20:40.020* :  Oh, and you can see video and images
*20:40.020- 20:42.120* :  of the happily reunited family of four
*20:42.180- 20:43.980* :  on the BBC News website.
*20:45.520- 20:49.520* :  Now to the sad tale of a reindeer who was pining away,
*20:49.920- 20:51.460* :  which now has a happy ending.
*20:52.060- 20:54.480* :  Sven's stable mate, Klaus, died suddenly
*20:54.700- 20:56.540* :  and his owners feared that he would die too
*20:56.860- 20:57.760* :  of a broken heart.
*20:58.640- 21:00.960* :  But they've now managed to find him a new love
*21:01.300- 21:02.440* :  thanks to crowdfunding.
*21:02.740- 21:04.280* :  Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*21:08.120- 21:10.920* :  The happy growth of a caribou reindeer greeting
*21:10.960- 21:12.420* :  a member of its pack.
*21:12.960- 21:14.940* :  But in a small patch of the world,
*21:14.940- 21:16.300* :  whole in Northern England,
*21:16.820- 21:18.900* :  one reindeer had fallen silent.
*21:19.820- 21:22.880* :  Sven, who lived on a farm with his stable mate, Klaus,
*21:22.880- 21:25.020* :  had become withdrawn and sad
*21:25.020- 21:27.720* :  when Klaus passed away after a sudden illness
*21:28.200- 21:30.740* :  and his owner, Susie Wright, feared the worst.
*21:31.520- 21:32.940* :  Well, I thought he might die with a broken heart
*21:32.940- 21:34.920* :  because well, he was on his own
*21:34.940- 21:37.400* :  and he was lonely and reindeer ahead animals
*21:37.400- 21:39.500* :  and they absolutely couldn't survive
*21:39.500- 21:41.920* :  on their own for a long period of time.
*21:41.920- 21:42.820* :  Shot him, obviously,
*21:42.820- 21:44.760* :  and so we found a partner for him,
*21:44.800- 21:46.580* :  but long term, I would fear
*21:46.580- 21:47.760* :  that actually he would pass away.
*21:48.340- 21:50.900* :  Susie's rescue centre, little haven farm
*21:50.900- 21:53.460* :  couldn't afford to buy another reindeer
*21:53.960- 21:55.260* :  and for herd animals, Sven,
*21:55.260- 21:57.440* :  following humans around wasn't enough.
*21:58.340- 22:00.320* :  Cody Chapman runs the animal company
*22:00.320- 22:02.220* :  and has her own herd of reindeer
*22:02.220- 22:04.940* :  and she told us why they can't be left alone.
*22:05.460- 22:06.900* :  It's just very important for them.
*22:06.900- 22:09.180* :  They feel a lot safer and a lot less stressed
*22:09.840- 22:11.880* :  and obviously in their native environment
*22:11.880- 22:13.480* :  they travel impacts for safety
*22:13.480- 22:16.140* :  from predators and obviously to find food.
*22:16.340- 22:18.420* :  Back in Hull, Sven wasn't eating,
*22:18.420- 22:21.540* :  had lost a lot of weight and was pacing up
*22:21.540- 22:22.940* :  and down his paddock.
*22:23.360- 22:25.720* :  Susie and her husband took a desperate chance
*22:25.720- 22:28.160* :  on a just giving fundraising page
*22:28.800- 22:30.020* :  and to their surprise,
*22:30.560- 22:32.240* :  the numbers started climbing.
*22:32.820- 22:35.640* :  Oh gosh, I don't think there's actually words
*22:35.640- 22:39.120* :  that can describe how I felt
*22:39.120- 22:41.320* :  when we realised it was actually going to happen.
*22:41.960- 22:44.900* :  Amazingly, the public across the country
*22:44.900- 22:47.020* :  and even the world came together
*22:47.600- 22:49.100* :  and got us the money.
*22:49.480- 22:52.340* :  Soon Susie and her husband were driving
*22:52.340- 22:55.880* :  at their trailer down to Dorset to pick up Daisy.
*22:56.460- 22:59.140* :  We managed to find a female
*22:59.140- 23:01.560* :  and we introduced them together
*23:01.780- 23:02.860* :  and it was, can I just say,
*23:02.860- 23:04.600* :  it was like, like, like, love at first sight.
*23:04.920- 23:07.040* :  So the actual point where is we tried to
*23:07.400- 23:08.220* :  keep them separate
*23:08.460- 23:10.560* :  so they can get used to each other gradually
*23:10.580- 23:13.540* :  and she was absolutely having none of it whatsoever.
*23:14.180- 23:15.400* :  So it's the point where she actually
*23:15.400- 23:17.580* :  broke down the partition between them
*23:17.900- 23:19.780* :  and it's just so lovely to see them together.
*23:20.320- 23:22.220* :  Instead of dying of a broken heart,

*26:38.720- 26:41.060* :  One day I was moving from one flat to my dorm
*26:41.620- 26:43.120* :  and I was walking along in Kensington
*26:43.180- 26:46.120* :  and I saw someone that looked very familiar from a distance
*26:46.120- 26:48.340* :  and so I kind of walked up and got closer
*26:48.340- 26:49.820* :  and as I stopped dead in my tracks
*26:49.820- 26:52.180* :  I realized it was someone I'd actually
*26:52.180- 26:54.220* :  grown up with across the street from
*26:54.780- 26:56.660* :  for about 10 years of my life in Illinois
*26:57.220- 26:58.340* :  and we went to high school together
*26:58.920- 27:00.060* :  and we hadn't seen each other
*27:00.480- 27:02.540* :  since I graduated, she was one year behind me.
*27:03.140- 27:05.600* :  So I kind of approached very cautiously
*27:05.600- 27:07.040* :  and then I just said hi Nicky
*27:07.700- 27:10.200* :  and it was amazing because I'd never gotten
*27:10.200- 27:13.360* :  such a shocked, surprised reaction of a scream
*27:13.360- 27:15.860* :  and a hug before or since really
*27:16.280- 27:17.700* :  she ran up and hugged me and did that thing
*27:17.700- 27:20.080* :  like in a TV show where they're hugging you
*27:20.080- 27:21.660* :  then they kind of lean back and look at you
*27:21.660- 27:23.320* :  and make sure it's real and then they hug you again.
*27:24.300- 27:26.180* :  So here we were randomly across the street
*27:26.180- 27:28.780* :  from a test going London over 45 of her miles
*27:28.780- 27:29.660* :  from where we grew up
*27:30.280- 27:32.600* :  and just randomly ran into each other
*27:32.600- 27:34.040* :  because she was waiting to cross the street
*27:34.120- 27:35.960* :  and I was hauling a bunch of luggage around
*27:36.660- 27:38.720* :  and I invited her over to my dorm room
*27:39.200- 27:41.040* :  that evening so I could call my parents
*27:41.700- 27:43.920* :  and basically called them and said
*27:43.920- 27:45.840* :  so I've got a surprise for you and you know
*27:45.840- 27:48.060* :  kind of dead silence and the Nicky just leans in
*27:48.100- 27:49.580* :  she goes hello Mrs. Kelly
*27:50.160- 27:51.600* :  and my parents just like
*27:52.220- 27:54.280* :  were so excited on the other end
*27:54.520- 27:57.580* :  and my dad who's not prone to being very emotional
*27:57.580- 27:59.640* :  was just like oh my gosh Nicky
*28:00.020- 28:01.440* :  my mom was kind of like yelling
*28:01.600- 28:02.320* :  it was really fun
*28:03.020- 28:04.780* :  fastward a little bit and the next month
*28:05.060- 28:07.340* :  we went to Scotland together with a friend of hers
*28:07.400- 28:09.840* :  and we just had this most amazing time in Edinburgh
*28:10.680- 28:13.340* :  and we just got to catch up for this whole summer
*28:13.340- 28:14.960* :  and it was just really fun and amazing
*28:15.680- 28:18.680* :  and then my parents actually got to come and visit us
*28:19.060- 28:21.360* :  I love this random moment in my life
*28:21.780- 28:23.620* :  that led to these really great experiences
