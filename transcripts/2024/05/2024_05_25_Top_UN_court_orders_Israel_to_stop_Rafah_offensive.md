*01:26.480- 01:30.880* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Saturday, the 25th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:30.880- 01:37.680* :  The United Nations' highest court has ruled that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in Raffa.
*01:38.280- 01:46.660* :  People have been fleeing a camp for displaced people in the Sudanese city of El Fasha as fighting between rival forces escalates.
*01:47.240- 01:50.500* :  Three members of an American missionary group have been killed in Haiti.
*01:53.240- 01:54.100* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:58.000- 01:59.860* :  There is a tiger in the bathroom.
*02:00.440- 02:06.600* :  With the rise of AI video generators, how much longer will real animal stars exist?
*02:09.780- 02:19.980* :  There's been a stark message for Israel from the UN's top court, the ICJ, halt all military operations in the city of Raffa and the southern part of the Gaza Strip.
*02:20.640- 02:31.140* :  Every day, the city, which is now filled with more than a million people who fled the conflict, is bombarded from the air and small scale Israeli incursions continue on the ground as well.
*02:31.920- 02:36.680* :  So let's look in more detail at what this ruling from the International Court of Justice in the Hague means.
*02:36.720- 02:39.900* :  It was delivered by the presiding judge Nawaf Salam.
*02:40.520- 02:50.020* :  The court considered that in conformity with obligations under the genocide convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive.
*02:50.980- 03:01.360* :  And any other action in the Raffa governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza, conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction,
*03:02.360- 03:03.340* :  in hold or in part.
*03:04.040- 03:07.340* :  Well, that call goes further than Washington has chosen to go.
*03:07.900- 03:18.060* :  And following the ruling, the European Union's top diplomat, Joseph Borrell, said the block will have to make a choice between supporting Israel or international institutions and the rule of law.
*03:18.620- 03:23.020* :  I heard more about the ICJ decision from our correspondent in the Hague and a hologram.
*03:23.440- 03:35.100* :  What we heard there from the presiding judge, Nawaf Salam, that was alluding to something that constitutes genocide under international law, the physical destruction in whole or part of the Palestinian people.
*03:35.620- 03:49.660* :  So beyond that order for Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Raffa, the judges ruled that Israel must allow unimpeded access to any UN mandated bodies to investigate allegations of genocide.
*03:49.660- 04:00.080* :  And must also ensure the Raffa border crossing stays open so the urgently needed humanitarian aid and assistance can be provided at scale.
*04:00.080- 04:05.060* :  And then Israel also has to report back on how it's implementing these orders within one month.
*04:05.060- 04:13.860* :  It really matters because what the judges are saying essentially is Raffa needs to continue to exist without this military incursion.
*04:14.060- 04:27.620* :  If there is to be any hope of Palestinian life in Gaza after the conflict because at the moment that's the center of where the aid is being distributed from and where so many people are now of course displaced and seeking refuge.
*04:27.620- 04:42.300* :  And this case was brought under the genocide convention. South Africa accused Israel of violating the genocide convention violating Palestinians right to exist, right to be protected by that convention which was set up after the Holocaust 1948
*04:42.500- 04:46.960* :  to give a legal foundation to the words never again. So this ruling really matters.
*04:47.300- 04:56.160* :  Anna, the UN Secretary General Anthony Gutierrez said that the decisions of the court are binding and he trusts that the parties will comply with the order from the court.
*04:56.160- 05:03.360* :  One guardsman in a camp for displaced people said we don't need a declaration, we need application and that is the issue, isn't it?
*05:03.900- 05:07.740* :  Israel has been told that it must do this but who's going to force it to do it?
*05:07.940- 05:21.920* :  That's exactly the challenge and this court can't force Israel, can't compel Israel to abide by these orders because it doesn't have any enforcement mechanism it relies on states to comply or international pressure to be applied.
*05:21.920- 05:37.480* :  We should also just mention at the end of the hearing judges urged Hamas to release unconditionally all Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza more than 100 people who were taken after the October 7th.
*05:37.480- 05:49.460* :  Attacks but the real focus now is what's happening in Raffa and whether or not Palestinians right to protection under the genocide convention can be upheld.
*05:50.200- 06:00.060* :  Anna Holigen in the hagg there, well as we heard the UN's top court has asked Israel to halt all military operations in the city of Raffa in the southern part of the Gaza strip.
*06:00.540- 06:10.700* :  This is because of the risk to civilians they say, well Julian Marshall spoke to Boaz Bismuth an MP for the Lecude party which is part of the Israeli governing coalition.
*06:11.240- 06:15.180* :  So is the court ruling regarding Raffa such a difficult order to obey?
*06:16.040- 06:23.020* :  Yes it is difficult because we're entitled, we're obliged to protect our nation, the Jewish state.
*06:23.720- 06:43.380* :  And if the battalions, the last battalions of Hamas and they're not so the last are still in Raffa and if our hostages are still in Raffa then we shall fight in Raffa but according to international law, we shall respect international law, we shall respect humanitarian international law, we shall evacuate civilians as we do we know do not touch civilians because this is not our aim.
*06:43.740- 06:54.060* :  Terrorist we shall and we shall look for them where they are in the Gaza strip because nobody will do it otherwise if we don't do it nobody will do it for us by the way just to explain to you why do I say such a thing.
*06:54.060- 07:03.880* :  No the president of the ICJ of the meeting was the Lebanese Lebanese judge Lebanese judge it doesn't I mean unbelievable our Lebanese judge I mean you can.
*07:03.880- 07:19.880* :  I mean he was the president he was the president he was the president he's Lebanese but it was a multinational panel doesn't show you it doesn't show you sir it doesn't show you that in his parliament you've got his Bala members but that doesn't show you whatsoever.
*07:19.880- 07:29.540* :  You spoke about all such as it's 125 doesn't make you understand that you should maybe tell the numbers three by the way bodies were brought back today to Israel.
*07:29.540- 07:41.620* :  The families are totally I mean in what in condition that you can't believe but we presented as a visual is the aggressor and my God I mean the other side are the oppressed I can do such a thing.
*07:41.620- 07:43.840* :  Okay so when I listen to your comment no no let me finish.
*07:44.100- 07:47.620* :  Okay Mr. Mr. Bismuth we don't have a lot of time.
*07:47.620- 07:53.440* :  I don't know but I will tell you unbelievable that I see see a nicely Jane yeah we don't talk about Hamas we speak about Israel.
*08:14.340- 08:19.360* :  Okay I can now ask questions I can now ask questions.
*08:19.920- 08:38.440* :  Okay it was Hamas that carried out those dreadful attacks in Israel last October but Israel has decided to avenge itself the Palestinian population of Gaza you feel that there is a justification for doing that.
*08:39.100- 08:54.300* :  But it seems that as if you're more and more out of step with international opinion which sees the needless deaths of civilians as Israel pursues its aim that is the that is the equation here.
*08:55.260- 09:24.480* :  So first of all when you speak of international opinion when I hear the let's take for example the ICC and the persecutor with this war and against the Israel prime minister never ever never ever a leader of a democratic country should have faith such an event I saw your prime minister I saw the American president that were not very much how would I say they didn't appreciate that decision on the contrary they attacked it I mean on the contrary they slammed it this is a big concerning the ICC today.
*09:24.480- 09:35.640* :  Let me remind you again Israel was addressed now one thing you have to I have to assure you enough to assure all the people listening to us we are fighting against terrorists not against civilians.
*09:35.640- 09:42.980* :  You speak about the Rafa now because we face constant more than 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the beginning.
*09:42.980- 09:52.440* :  Sir can you guarantee to me how many among them are civilians our terrorists can you guarantee to me how many were killed by Israel or by Hamas can you tell me do you know the numbers.
*09:53.200- 09:54.280* :  I was birds bismuth.
*09:55.320- 10:11.420* :  For more on what impact the ICJ ruling will have on the situation in Gaza our world affairs correspondent Paul Adams who's in Jerusalem has this assessment as the courts ruling was being read out at the hagg columns of thick black smoke rose over Rafa following yet more airstrikes.
*10:13.540- 10:20.640* :  No one should be under any illusion Israel is not about to halt its attack on a city it describes as the last stronghold of Hamas.
*10:21.180- 10:24.860* :  Hamas officials were quick to welcome the ruling but said it didn't go far enough.
*10:24.860- 10:30.880* :  Israel's assault on the northern refugee camp of Jabbalia a spokesman told the BBC was no less bloody.
*10:31.660- 10:38.420* :  The Office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called South Africa's accusations false outrageous and repulsive.
*10:38.420- 10:53.340* :  It said Israel had not and would not carry out military activity in Rafa which could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population in whole or in part and it said it would continue to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and act according to international law.
*10:54.080- 11:05.720* :  But with 800,000 Palestinians forced to flee aid in desperately short supply and parts of the wider Rafa area already being reduced to rubble the court was clearly not persuaded by Israel's arguments.
*11:06.660- 11:15.660* :  For now Mr Netanyahu seems determined to press on but the ICJ ruling is just the latest in a series of signs of Israel's increasing international isolation.
*11:15.660- 11:21.960* :  The prospect of arrest warrants from the international criminal court against Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister.
*11:21.960- 11:34.920* :  The decision of three EU members to recognize the state of Palestine reports from Washington suggesting that the Biden administration is losing patience with what it sees as the lack of a long term Israeli strategy.
*11:35.580- 11:47.340* :  The international court of justice may be powerless to stop the war but the political and diplomatic cost of Benjamin Netanyahu's relentless pursuit of what he calls total victory in Gaza is mounting by the day.
*11:47.340- 12:04.420* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Now to some other news. Thousands of civilians are continuing to flee their homes in the Sudanese city of El Fasha in Dalfur as fighting escalates between the rapid support forces or RSF and the military.
*12:04.420- 12:10.040* :  The U.N. has warned of a growing risk of genocide in Dalfur. Will Ross reports?
*12:10.780- 12:16.500* :  Eyewitnesses say a large area of Abu Shokkamp is now deserted after people living there fled the RSF attacks.
*12:17.340- 12:22.340* :  Many of the thousands on the move are making their way to what they hope will be safer areas of El Fasha city.
*12:22.760- 12:29.940* :  But the fighting has been intensifying and spreading non-Arab rebel groups that sided with the army have been targeting RSF positions.
*12:30.700- 12:35.180* :  The Sudanese Air Force has carried out air strikes causing further mass displacement of civilians.
*12:35.180- 12:42.480* :  Sam are managing to make it out of the city but the journeys are dangerous and without a ceasefire the situation will only deteriorate.
*12:42.480- 12:46.620* :  There's a great risk of more civilians being targeted based on their ethnicity.
*12:47.200- 12:47.580* :  Will Ross.
*12:48.620- 12:55.440* :  A US missionary couple have been killed in Haiti as widespread gang violence continues to plague the country.
*12:56.040- 13:03.820* :  Natalie and David Lloyd along with the Haitian Jude Montice were shot when the missionary group's compound was ambushed by gunmen.
*13:03.820- 13:10.380* :  The couple's deaths were confirmed on Facebook by Natalie's father as the Missouri State Senator Ben Baker.
*13:10.880- 13:17.900* :  The White House said the killings reinforced the need for a swift deployment of a Kenyan-led multinational force in Haiti.
*13:18.520- 13:19.260* :  Will Grant reports?
*13:20.260- 13:30.200* :  As details of the attack emerge it appears the Missouri congressman's daughter and son-in-law Natalie and David Lloyd were ambushed as they left the church youth event in Porto Prince with their children.
*13:31.140- 13:37.980* :  The couple were in the country working with a missionary group called Missions in Haiti, an organization established by Mr Lloyd's parents.
*13:38.920- 13:42.800* :  In a statement congressman Baker said his heart was broken in a thousand pieces.
*13:43.720- 13:50.560* :  Please pray for my family we desperately need the strength and please pray for the Lloyd family as well said the Republican lawmaker.
*13:51.580- 13:59.060* :  In March the US State Department issued an advisory to all US citizens against travel to Haiti given the widespread gang violence in the country.
*13:59.880- 14:11.880* :  As the security situation in Haiti steadily deteriorated many US citizens in the country left either over the land border with the Dominican Republic or flew out before gangs forced the airport to close for several months.
*14:11.880- 14:22.340* :  Since then the nation has descended into near Anarchy. Thousands of people have been killed in the streets as gangs strengthen their control of the capital city and forced out the Prime Minister.
*14:23.240- 14:25.940* :  In recent days the airport has been reopened.
*14:25.940- 14:38.480* :  The first deployment of Kenyan police officers to lead an anti-gang security force has been delayed but the Kenyan president William Ruto confirmed his country's commitment to the plan during a state visit to the White House earlier this week.
*14:39.240- 14:42.860* :  That was Will Grant. Next to the French capital Paris.
*14:46.280- 14:56.420* :  Where a ceremony took place on Friday in the city to unveil the newly restored iron cross that sits on top of the city's famous Notre Dame Cathedral.
*14:56.500- 15:10.560* :  It was the only thing to survive from the building's roof after the devastating fire in 2019. It's been reinstalled above the cathedral's choir section after being repaired by iron workers from the Calvados region of France.
*15:10.560- 15:17.180* :  Not to dumb has slowly been restored and rebuilt since the fire. Here's our Paris correspondent, Houston Gofield.
*15:17.880- 15:29.520* :  The 12 meter high cross had stood over the roof of the apps at the eastern end of the cathedral. By luck it survived the fire by the simple expedient of crashing to the ground early in the course of that disastrous evening.
*15:29.520- 15:35.080* :  It meant that though the artifact was shattered into pieces, those pieces could be retrieved and reassembled.
*15:35.600- 15:40.940* :  Over the course of the last year and a half that's what's been done at a specialist iron foundry in Normandy.
*15:41.380- 15:47.360* :  And now in an intricate operation the cross has been returned to the roof in exactly the same place where it stood before.
*15:55.580- 16:08.160* :  There was a short open air ceremony to bless the cross, an opportunity for the presiding priest to recall that the cathedral is not just a museum whose reopening in December is so eagerly awaited but also a place of worship.
*16:08.720- 16:13.260* :  Houston Gofield in France. Still to come.

*17:50.480- 18:02.480* :  shields sexual violence against women and children just some of the latest reports coming out of Myanmar's Rakhine state where the UN says 45,000 ethnic
*18:02.480- 18:11.000* :  Rohingyas have been forced to escape fighting they fled to the border with Bangladesh after a rebel group took over the town of
*18:11.000- 18:16.460* :  Bhutidong from the army. Our Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristol tell me more.
*18:17.220- 18:29.320* :  A few days ago the Arakan army that's a rebel group in the state of Rakhine in the west of Myanmar took over the town of Bhutidong right on the border with Bangladesh.
*18:29.320- 18:32.940* :  They beat the army who did control that particular town.
*18:32.980- 18:45.140* :  But what's happened is that people living in the town there were many many thousands of Muslim Rohingya and they've been displaced in the fight and they've been forced towards the border with Bangladesh.
*18:45.140- 18:57.860* :  And they report that the town their homes their businesses their livelihoods everything that they have has essentially been burnt to the ground one person described the town as being reduced to ashes.
*18:58.580- 19:10.100* :  And what's happened now is that the human rights commissioner based in Geneva is just expressed his concern for these 45,000 Rohingya who at the moment a great risk.
*19:10.100- 19:15.540* :  This is what the commissioners spoke from Elizabeth Trossel had to say about him.
*19:15.680- 19:24.900* :  In this appalling situation civilians are once more victimized killed their properties destroyed and looted their demands for safety and security ignored.
*19:25.420- 19:29.220* :  And they are again forced to flee their homes in a recurring nightmare of suffering.
*19:29.620- 19:39.100* :  Well Mickey as Elizabeth Trossel was saying there this is part of a long history of Rohingyas having to flee situations like this isn't it?
*19:39.300- 19:51.420* :  It certainly is as you say a desperate line of of terrible things going back a decade or more really the Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar have never been accepted as citizens.
*19:51.420- 20:04.000* :  In fact, they don't have citizenship in their first persecution waves and waves of persecution last big one was in 2017 when hundreds of thousands of them fled across the border into Bangladesh.
*20:04.000- 20:10.980* :  Many of them are still there living very desperate, squalid lives in refugee camps, securities poor there.
*20:11.280- 20:22.060* :  And for the Rohingya it's all made more difficult because at the moment the broader picture is a fight against the military government for the control of the whole of Myanmar.
*20:22.680- 20:34.280* :  Yeah this is just one rebel force the arrogant army fighting the Burmese military in Rikain state but all across Myanmar you have rebel groups fighting the military.
*20:34.280- 20:47.860* :  And as well as these ethnic groups as also people's defense forces who have taken up arms against the military government and over recent months the fighting has really escalated across the whole of the country.
*20:48.440- 20:50.280* :  This is just one bit of it.
*20:50.840- 20:51.480* :  Mickey Bristow.
*20:52.540- 20:57.500* :  The Romanian authorities have arrested a man they suspect of spying for Russia.
*20:58.160- 21:05.780* :  Romania has become a hub for Western military and humanitarian supplies being sent into Ukraine since the Russian invasion.
*21:06.420- 21:07.040* :  Nick Thought reports.
*21:07.860- 21:13.100* :  News of the arrest was made public by the Romanian directorate for investigating organized crime.
*21:13.100- 21:28.860* :  The 39-year-old who's been named by Romanian media as Alexandru Piscan stands accused of gathering information on military bases and on convoys taking military supplies to Ukraine and passing that material to Russian diplomats.
*21:29.260- 21:36.860* :  In Bucharest the Russian Shahjedefair was summoned to the Romanian foreign ministry to be told that a Russian diplomat is to be expelled.
*21:37.760- 21:38.380* :  That was Nick Thought.
*21:38.500- 21:50.480* :  Iranian state media say the country's army has found no signs of criminal activity in a helicopter crash that killed President Ibrahim Reisi on Sunday.
*21:51.140- 21:54.040* :  Our regional Middle East editor Mike Thompson reports.
*21:54.860- 22:02.480* :  Soon after President Reisi's helicopter crashed on Sunday in a mountainous region of northwest Iran rumours began circulating.
*22:03.200- 22:07.180* :  Some accuse the country's arch-enemy Israel of shooting the craft down.
*22:07.180- 22:17.800* :  But a preliminary report by the Iranian army said no bullet holes had been found in the wreckage and there'd been no suspicious communications between the watchtower and the flight crew.
*22:18.320- 22:24.480* :  The report concluded that the helicopter crashed after catching fire in an elevated area in foggy conditions.
*22:24.500- 22:31.540* :  The late president was buried in his hometown of Meshad on Thursday after several days of funeral ceremonies.
*22:32.280- 22:32.780* :  Mike Thompson.

*22:45.760- 22:49.840* :  Zero compensation, zero medical insurance for all the injuries he's sustained when he won this.
*22:50.320- 22:50.880* :  My coach.
*22:51.220- 23:01.260* :  That is part of the trailer of the 2021 film National Champions which is about a college football player strike in order to fight for fair compensation.
*23:02.100- 23:04.800* :  While the film is fiction, it mirrors real life.
*23:04.800- 23:10.700* :  Despite attracting huge audiences, college athletes in the US are not directly paid.
*23:11.360- 23:12.940* :  But that could be about to change.
*23:12.940- 23:24.940* :  The National Collegiate Athletic Association or NCAA which governs university sports in the US has reached a deal that could lead to college athletes getting paid.
*23:25.400- 23:32.000* :  Rahul Tannen spoke to George Zelks, a lawyer who has brought a case on behalf of a college student in Colorado.
*23:32.580- 23:34.860* :  He taught him how the current system works.
*23:35.700- 23:41.940* :  Traditionally the only compensation they get is in the form of scholarships and some benefits.
*23:41.940- 23:44.560* :  That started to change a couple of years ago.
*23:44.560- 23:48.840* :  Compensation was available for name, image and likeness issues.
*23:49.320- 23:52.980* :  So when we look at college sports, it's important to note here, isn't it?
*23:53.960- 24:02.140* :  Whilst it is seen to be sports played by amateurs, there's actually a lot of revenue being generated when it comes to TV revenue.
*24:02.140- 24:03.580* :  This is big business, isn't it?
*24:03.680- 24:04.240* :  Absolutely.
*24:04.520- 24:16.360* :  And one of the things that's interesting is when you talk to older people, their reaction is, well, why should athletes at a college where they're getting an education, they're getting scholarships receive additional compensation?
*24:17.360- 24:24.460* :  Having been a former athlete in college myself, when you're playing at the major school level, it's a full-time job.
*24:24.720- 24:38.240* :  And in many ways, you're disadvantaged in terms of the opportunities the students that are not burdened with the commitments that you have to make as an athlete have in terms of their academic work, graduation opportunities afterwards, that sort of thing.
*24:38.240- 24:41.920* :  So it's absolutely a full-time job and they should be viewed as employees.
*24:42.280- 24:48.720* :  Give us an idea of what sort of revenues and give us an idea of the level of interest there are in college sports.
*24:49.220- 25:03.380* :  It's not unusual for college football in the United States and college basketball, both men's and women's basketball, to garner the kind of television viewing that's greater than the professional sports are on occasion.
*25:03.740- 25:11.260* :  Can you tell us where we are in the legal process here because we have a number of college students who are saying, look, we're entitled to some of the revenue money.
*25:11.260- 25:16.580* :  We've seen another significant development in the last few days. Where are we overall legally here?
*25:17.000- 25:27.480* :  What's triggered the current settlement proposal is the fact that in one of the, what I refer to as the name, image like this case, it's called the house case.
*25:28.080- 25:36.340* :  That is scheduled to go to trial in January of next year and the NCAA does not want to go to trial in front of a jury.
*25:36.500- 25:40.480* :  The terms of the settlement and the proposal have not been filed with the court yet.
*25:40.480- 25:44.980* :  What's available to the public is basically information that's been leaked to the media.
*25:45.480- 25:53.760* :  It looks, doesn't it? And we are still some way to go here that there could be a settlement involving billions of dollars that could go to hundreds of college athletes.
*25:54.600- 25:58.840* :  So are we looking at the end of amateurism in college sports?
*25:59.360- 26:17.140* :  I certainly believe if you view the concept of student employee athletes being compensated and being entitled to a percentage or portion of the revenue that they generate, as you know, I call them content creators the same way people in the entertainment business are referred to.
*26:17.140- 26:26.580* :  Yes, I think those days are over. Keep in mind that top level coaches in men's football are being compensated at the level of in excess of $10 million.
*26:27.840- 26:37.440* :  And so when people pause and say, well, why should an athlete receive any money? You know, they're getting a scholarship. My reaction is why should a college football coach receive $10 million or more?
*26:38.060- 26:39.840* :  Okay, it just becomes a negotiation.
*26:40.260- 26:53.540* :  Well, it becomes a negotiation, but should they get less than what a professional gets in terms of that percentage of revenues because they are getting something else with it, which is a college education, which is pretty expensive in the US.
*26:53.540- 27:00.660* :  It's a fair question. It depends upon what kind of revenue they're generating for their employer.
*27:00.660- 27:16.640* :  If you're talking about a professional athlete whose sport generates a million dollars versus a college sport that generates billions of dollars, the idea that the college athlete, the content creators should get more than the professional in that comparison.
*27:17.280- 27:22.000* :  It shouldn't surprise anybody. It depends upon the value that you're bringing to the table.
*27:22.460- 27:31.940* :  Don't college athletes, then they'll get the benefits when they become professional athletes. You know, if you are performing well at the college level, the contracts you're going to get afterwards are huge.
*27:31.940- 27:34.900* :  So you are getting money. You are getting money, aren't you?
*27:35.500- 27:44.060* :  Here's the thing you have to keep in mind. A very tiny, tiny percentage of college athletes ever go forward at the professional level.
*27:44.060- 27:51.000* :  The vast majority of them are looking for employment in regular markets the way you and I did after college.
*27:51.860- 27:53.700* :  That was the lawyer George Zelkes.
*27:54.720- 28:02.040* :  While staying in the US, the documentary maker Morgan Spurlock has died at the age of 53. He'd had cancer.
*28:02.040- 28:12.440* :  He was best known for his film Super Size Me in which he ate nothing but McDonald's for an entire month in order to measure the toll on his body.
*28:14.580- 28:21.640* :  It was an experiment that sparked a nationwide debate in America and beyond about fast food culture and obesity.
*28:21.640- 28:28.520* :  For 30 days in 2003, Morgan Spurlock ate three meals a day in McDonald's.
*28:29.700- 28:33.880* :  Can I get the double quarter pounder with cheese meal?
*28:33.880- 28:37.780* :  I think I'm going to have to go Super Size.
*28:37.780- 28:42.180* :  The smash hit documentary was nominated for an Oscar in 2005.
*28:42.500- 28:52.380* :  Its enormous success was followed by a decision by McDonald's to stop offering so-called Super Size portions, although the restaurant chain denied any link.
*28:52.900- 29:01.760* :  Morgan Spurlock went on to produce many more documentaries in the years after, covering such controversial topics as gun control and the war in Afghanistan.
*29:02.400- 29:08.000* :  Later, he admitted to alcoholism and sexual misconduct, effectively ending his career.
*29:08.500- 29:18.200* :  In a statement announcing his death, the filmmaker's brother said the world had lost a true creative genius and that he was so proud to have worked with him.
*29:18.840- 29:19.380* :  Will Vernon?
*29:20.880- 29:27.400* :  Will it take my job? That is the worry in the back of many people's minds when they think of artificial intelligence.
*29:27.500- 29:37.500* :  In the world of entertainment, it's a particular concern because AI companies have started showing off what kind of videos can be generated by anyone with a few text commands.
*29:38.120- 29:40.220* :  So no need perhaps for film crews.
*29:41.140- 29:52.040* :  While actors, set decorators and directors have unions and lawyers representing their interests, Hollywood's animal stars could be the first casualty of AI video generators.
*29:52.640- 29:54.060* :  Reagan Morris reports from LA.
*29:58.000- 29:59.880* :  Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom!
*30:01.140- 30:08.320* :  Ever since the dog Rin Tin Tin became an international film star after World War One, animals have been a part of Hollywood productions.
*30:11.700- 30:14.640* :  But even the MGM lion is computer generated now.
*30:15.460- 30:27.540* :  And since artificial intelligence companies have started showing off what that technology is capable of, creating realistic looking scenes, people, places, and animals with just a few text commands,
*30:28.380- 30:33.200* :  many animal trainers who work on film sets think that their jobs are on the verge of extinction.
*30:33.200- 30:41.580* :  When I started back in 2001, that company that I worked for, they had 30 big cats. We had an African elephant. We had two bears.
*30:41.580- 30:46.320* :  You know, you could support that because there was work for those animals.
*30:46.940- 30:53.680* :  Greg Smith Aldridge was one of the tiger trainers on the hangover. And his work does a Hollywood animal wrangler for more than 20 years.
*30:53.680- 31:02.800* :  I'm certainly worried about my future. I mean, like all the AI stuff that comes out now, the little Instagram posts and things that people send me, they used to be like, yeah, but they don't have the hair right.
*31:02.800- 31:08.880* :  Yeah, look at this eyes looking. Now a dog would never do that. Now it's like, where do we get an application to Walmart?
*31:09.600- 31:12.060* :  We have this is Clarence. He's 100 year old.
*31:12.860- 31:13.840* :  It's a lot like those tortoise.
*31:13.980- 31:14.600* :  Oh, wow.
*31:14.820- 31:21.260* :  The animal training and management course at More Park College north of Los Angeles is where many Hollywood animal wranglers learn their craft.
*31:21.260- 31:27.760* :  The students run a teaching zoo, which includes an African lion, a few tigers, as well as Clarence, the tortoise.
*31:28.120- 31:28.860* :  How much does he wait?
*31:29.440- 31:30.360* :  About 500 pounds.
*31:30.580- 31:37.080* :  Gary Moe is a graduate of the college and now he's back as a teacher. After nearly 25 years working as a Hollywood animal trainer.
*31:37.720- 31:42.300* :  The reason why I worked in the film industry for so long was because that's who was hiring.
*31:43.320- 31:44.480* :  There was a boom in the mid 90s.
*31:44.840- 31:46.300* :  How have you seen the industry change?
*31:46.640- 31:48.040* :  Industry is always evolving.
*31:49.020- 31:50.440* :  You probably won't see exotics anymore.
*31:51.060- 31:54.460* :  So anything that's not a dog or a cat or a horse.
*31:54.860- 31:57.360* :  I see a lot of CG in it.
*31:57.760- 32:00.480* :  It's a shame there's a lot of good work there and good people.
*32:01.460- 32:03.320* :  Frankly, there's things that we cannot do.
*32:03.480- 32:09.960* :  So like if you look at the planet of the apes movies, the new ones, I can't train a silverback gorilla to ride a horse.
*32:10.920- 32:12.440* :  And then there's like a hundred of them.
*32:12.440- 32:14.560* :  So like it looks, it looks real enough.
*32:14.940- 32:18.860* :  Legend says, a pond human lived side by side.
*32:19.520- 32:24.140* :  Animal rights activists have fought for decades to get real animals off of film sets.
*32:24.660- 32:29.080* :  So for many, AI video generators of realistic animals is welcome news.
*32:30.580- 32:34.200* :  So what happens to these trained exotic animals now that Hollywood is down with them?
*32:34.420- 32:38.400* :  This is the monkey compared to the Caribbean and she does not like the monkey in my hands.
*32:38.400- 32:39.100* :  This is Tara.
*32:39.720- 32:45.280* :  After 17 years as a Hollywood trainer, Stacey Gunderson now runs an animal sanctuary north of Los Angeles.
*32:45.680- 32:47.940* :  I did a movie called Hocus Pocus where the cat talks.
*32:48.520- 32:49.740* :  That was the very beginning of CGI.
*32:49.740- 32:55.120* :  So the cat did everything and then the computer graphic guys made the mouthwork so that the cat talked.
*32:55.400- 32:59.700* :  Surely Hollywood must approach you. They know you're here and they know you've got these trained animals.
*32:59.700- 33:01.120* :  Do you ever get still get approached?
*33:01.220- 33:01.580* :  I do.
*33:01.860- 33:03.300* :  Yeah, I do and I turn them all down.
*33:03.720- 33:05.720* :  There's never an offer that good.
*33:06.320- 33:09.500* :  Well, the very first thing they want the animal to do is they want to look right in the lens.
*33:10.160- 33:11.440* :  And monkeys don't look in the lens.
*33:11.880- 33:14.860* :  The monkey is here for the monkey, not for the movie.
*33:15.440- 33:20.760* :  I'm looking at how AI and CGI are getting so much more advanced.
*33:21.040- 33:22.420* :  It's a gift from heaven.
*33:22.700- 33:24.540* :  Yeah, they can make a monkey look right in the camera.
*33:24.820- 33:25.380* :  That's beautiful.
*33:25.920- 33:26.460* :  I love it.
*33:27.100- 33:27.820* :  So you welcome that.
*33:27.820- 33:28.720* :  You think that's good news?
*33:28.720- 33:29.160* :  For sure.
*33:29.740- 33:30.440* :  That's good for monkeys.
*33:32.660- 33:34.120* :  Reagan Morris in Los Angeles.
*33:36.800- 33:41.160* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later on.
