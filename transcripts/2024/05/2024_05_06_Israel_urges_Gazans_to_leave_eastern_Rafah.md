*01:24.080- 01:29.120* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 6th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:29.120- 01:34.740* :  Palestinians are beginning to move out of Rafa in Gaza after an Israeli order to leave.
*01:34.740- 01:37.180* :  One woman told us what this means for her.
*01:37.480- 01:40.840* :  I have no place to go. This was the last place I know.
*01:41.620- 01:46.240* :  And actually, if I want to come back to Hanyunas, there is no place. It's all destroyed.
*01:47.200- 01:51.560* :  China's president Xi Jinping is in France on the first stop of a tour of Europe.
*01:52.080- 01:56.360* :  The people of Chad are voting for a new president after three years of military rule,
*01:56.740- 02:00.220* :  but the skepticism about how much change it will bring.
*02:02.740- 02:07.960* :  Also, this podcast, Combat Veterans in Ukraine say the method of conscription should change.
*02:07.960- 02:14.080* :  It would be more effective if military recruitment office would say.
*02:14.240- 02:19.420* :  You will have a super hard job in the country, but for example, for half a year.
*02:20.260- 02:23.440* :  And correcting a music myth about Mama Cass Elliott.
*02:27.860- 02:32.200* :  Many countries, including the United States, have warned against Israel's planned ground
*02:32.200- 02:37.260* :  offensive into Rafa, a city in the southern Gaza Strip, now home to about one and a half
*02:37.260- 02:41.360* :  million people sheltering from the conflict. But now, a hundred thousand
*02:41.360- 02:46.240* :  gardens have been ordered to leave Eastern Rafa to what are being called humanitarian zones.
*02:46.260- 02:50.240* :  The Israeli military says the military operation there will be of limited scope.
*02:50.240- 02:54.520* :  Hamas official has described the move as a dangerous escalation.
*02:54.920- 03:00.640* :  Gada Al-Qud is a mother of two who's already been displaced six times since the start of the conflict.
*03:00.640- 03:06.320* :  She lives near the affected areas in Rafa and has been speaking to the BBC's Mishah Hussein.
*03:06.840- 03:15.240* :  I'm so confused, just to be honest. I have no place to go. This was the last place I know.
*03:16.040- 03:21.140* :  And actually, if I want to come back to Hanyunist, there is no place. It's all destroyed.
*03:21.500- 03:28.580* :  Two areas of Malmawasi, they are crowded and I cannot anymore live inside tent.
*03:28.580- 03:34.240* :  It's so hot and my health, it's not a love for me to to to be in such a situation.
*03:34.500- 03:40.240* :  When you say you're you're hearing about an evacuation plan, how are people hearing?
*03:40.920- 03:46.900* :  The flyers, they're just the Israeli defence forces, they are through flyers to all of these areas.
*03:46.900- 03:54.300* :  And actually, to my place now, I I saw one of these flyers nearby and they are
*03:54.300- 04:01.620* :  start to call people like and record to evacuate these areas and send messages to to be
*04:01.620- 04:08.600* :  able to evacuate and already they announced on the ex that you should evacuate these areas and
*04:08.600- 04:13.360* :  people are like trying to call each other just to be in a safer place.
*04:13.600- 04:17.600* :  And do these flyers or these messages, do they say where you should evacuate too?
*04:18.420- 04:23.640* :  Yeah, they said like you have to evacuate the humanitarian, the expanded humanitarian areas in
*04:23.640- 04:27.900* :  Al Malmawasi in Hanyunist. And do you think that if you went there, you would be safe there?
*04:28.280- 04:33.840* :  I don't think so. No, absolutely not. Hanyunist is completely destroyed and they're
*04:33.840- 04:41.200* :  conducting some ground invasion. I'm in the middle area, it's all being targeted. I've been there
*04:41.200- 04:49.480* :  and I saw like huge distractions in areas. Camps of Maghazir, Burayj and Anosairat, also the
*04:49.500- 04:55.260* :  border of Gaza, so it's still very dangerous. It must be really difficult to know what you
*04:55.260- 04:59.760* :  what to do. You've been, you know, you've told us that you're confused. Are you with a group
*04:59.760- 05:03.860* :  of people I think before when we spoke you were with your sister? Are you still together?
*05:03.860- 05:08.480* :  So you will decide together what to do? Fortunately, my sister is all of them. They
*05:09.320- 05:16.060* :  went out from Gaza. They are now in Egypt. I'm still here with my brothers. So if we were
*05:16.060- 05:19.060* :  going to move, we're almost together. But where to go? We don't know yet.
*05:19.880- 05:24.940* :  Gil Dickman's aunt was killed on October the 7th and two of his cousins were taken hostage,
*05:25.420- 05:30.460* :  one has been released. He told the BBC he's feeling very weary about what's happening.
*05:31.120- 05:37.660* :  Now, unfortunately, we're very much afraid as families of hostages about what's going to happen.
*05:37.660- 05:45.420* :  We're very much afraid that the IDF entering Rafah will risk the lives, not only of innocent
*05:45.420- 05:54.680* :  people, not only of soldiers, but also of some hostages who might be risked because of the attack
*05:54.680- 06:00.400* :  on Rafah. So what do we know about this latest evacuation? I asked our Arab affairs editor,
*06:00.400- 06:05.780* :  Sebastien Asher. We started to see some of the displaced Palestinians on the move again,
*06:06.500- 06:10.520* :  pictures that we've seen many times during the past seven months of the conflict.
*06:11.780- 06:16.040* :  As we were hearing there, many of those who were moving with what's left of their belongings
*06:16.040- 06:20.580* :  in black plastic bags, this is made their 5th, 6th, 7th time, but they've had to move
*06:21.000- 06:26.120* :  moving with donkey carts, with a car if they still have one on foot. It's a miserable
*06:26.120- 06:30.380* :  scene. It's raining hard there. So it gives a sense of the misery. As we were hearing,
*06:30.420- 06:36.820* :  though, where they've been told to go by the Israeli army, they don't see as any better in terms
*06:36.820- 06:40.200* :  of what it can provide them where they are at the moment. These are two camp cities,
*06:40.200- 06:45.760* :  which are already according to gardens, very overcrowded, and they just simply don't believe
*06:45.760- 06:49.340* :  the assurances that Israel gives them, the military gives them that they'll be safe there,
*06:49.340- 06:54.380* :  because each time they've moved to a place, they've been told safe it hasn't turned out to be so.
*06:55.020- 06:59.480* :  So what does this tell us, do you think Sebastien, about the state of the peace process,
*06:59.480- 07:04.480* :  because there had been talks going on in Cairo? There had been, and as we've seen before,
*07:04.480- 07:10.140* :  they started off very positively. Big signs from all sides, mediators from Hamas, from Israel,
*07:10.920- 07:16.540* :  talk of a compromise between the two sides. The US selling it very strongly is saying,
*07:16.540- 07:21.680* :  this is a really generous deal that Israel is making. And what we've seen in the last couple of
*07:21.680- 07:27.640* :  days, in Cairo, where the talks were happening, and now they moved to Qatar, where the Hamas
*07:27.840- 07:31.780* :  delegation went after the talks, is both sides essentially accusing each other,
*07:32.220- 07:36.740* :  of causing them essentially to collapse. That is because they haven't really shifted their
*07:36.740- 07:40.600* :  positions. From the Hamas side, they're saying the fact that the Israeli government was saying
*07:40.880- 07:46.620* :  it will go into Raffa, whatever happens, means, but it's key demand that there should be a
*07:46.620- 07:50.840* :  permanent ceasefire, even if its state wasn't likely to happen. And Israel in return,
*07:50.840- 07:56.220* :  has said, because of that demand, they couldn't exceed to the agreement as it stood.
*08:08.200- 08:13.420* :  For the first time in five years, the Chinese premier Xi Jinping is on an official visit to Europe.
*08:13.920- 08:18.440* :  He's in Paris for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the European
*08:18.440- 08:24.700* :  Commission, Ursula Vonder Lyon. Europe is China's second largest trading partner after the United
*08:24.700- 08:29.700* :  States. I heard more from our Paris correspondent, Hughes-Gurford. What they say, well, we don't know,
*08:29.700- 08:35.620* :  we've seen them remarks before the cameras, but they were always, rather bland, talking about
*08:35.620- 08:39.900* :  the need for cooperation in order to sort out various world problems and so on. The plenty of
*08:39.900- 08:44.480* :  sort of goodwill on the surface, but beneath that, we know that there are problems, there's
*08:44.480- 08:49.560* :  enormous tension between Europe and China on the trade front with Europe accusing China of
*08:49.880- 08:55.440* :  offloading its extra capacity in cars, electric vehicles and so on, and China retaliating with
*08:55.440- 09:01.660* :  investigation into French cognac and liquors and so on, and on Ukraine, which is the other big issue,
*09:01.660- 09:07.760* :  you know, the French would love to use President Xi as a kind of lever on President Putin,
*09:07.760- 09:11.720* :  but I don't think there's any particular expectation that that'll ever happen.
*09:12.720- 09:17.940* :  This is President Xi's first visit to Europe in five years. I mean, what concrete do you think
*09:17.940- 09:23.100* :  could come out of this visit? Or is it all about really bottoming on the surface?
*09:23.100- 09:29.480* :  Yes. Well, it's not just about bottoming, it's just about power politics, and it's
*09:29.480- 09:36.100* :  immensely important to be in these strange and difficult times, and President Xi is clearly
*09:36.780- 09:42.440* :  the leader of an increasingly assertive China, and Europe, for its wise, increasingly worried
*09:42.440- 09:48.040* :  about the way the world is developing. I don't think anything specific is going to come out of
*09:48.040- 09:51.300* :  this, though. I mean, I'd dare say there'll be some trade agreements here and there, but those
*09:51.300- 09:56.760* :  are kind of traditional and powerful, of course. I think far more important is, you know, whether
*09:57.240- 10:02.900* :  over time, subsequently, we see a change in behaviour from the Chinese towards the Europeans,
*10:02.900- 10:08.920* :  and you know, I think the Europeans will see this as a success if there are, you know, movements
*10:08.920- 10:15.480* :  by China to, for example, accept some of the European arguments about Chinese dumping and so on,
*10:15.480- 10:21.800* :  but I mean, the bottom line of all this is that China feels itself increasingly powerful and
*10:21.800- 10:28.860* :  assertive. The European, they believe that the European is a declining power. The whole sense of
*10:28.860- 10:32.780* :  the dynamic is one in which the Chinese feel that they are the ones that hold the cards.
*10:33.440- 10:39.500* :  Hugh Schofield in Paris. Troops on the Ukrainian front line have told the BBC the army must
*10:39.500- 10:45.260* :  rethink conscription. Some have been fighting without a break since Russia's full-scale invasion
*10:45.260- 10:50.540* :  more than two years ago. Ukraine is expecting the arrival of the multi-billion dollar U.S. aid
*10:50.540- 10:55.800* :  package, but it also needs to find more people willing to fight. Ukraine correspondent James
*10:55.800- 11:07.120* :  Waterhouse reports from Eastern Donetsk region. The rich green of this dense woodland gives you an
*11:07.120- 11:15.160* :  illusion of calm. These guys are living in a series of bunkers next to a grad multiple
*11:15.160- 11:22.780* :  rocket launch system. They are eagerly awaiting this American aid, but its arrival won't solve
*11:23.800- 11:29.480* :  all of Ukraine's problems because the country is trying to mobilize enough men to replace these
*11:29.480- 11:38.480* :  exhausted soldiers. As helicopters hug the tree line above, they're relaxed commander,
*11:38.480- 11:46.200* :  assures us they're Ukrainian. He goes by the call sign, Chish. Of course there are people who
*11:46.200- 11:51.020* :  need to have a rest. Those were at the very front line in the direct contact with the enemy.
*11:51.020- 11:57.740* :  They are tired, but training people is difficult. My people became professionals after fighting for
*11:57.740- 12:06.620* :  so long. They know each rocket launcher here. The bunker is dug into a hillside and you can tell
*12:06.620- 12:11.620* :  it's well lived in you've got your coffee pot as you'd expect and Alexander who's the
*12:12.360- 12:19.960* :  radio operator. I didn't expect we would win over Russia in two or three months and go back.
*12:20.900- 12:26.660* :  If we all go home, inexperienced soldiers might be able to hold the line, but many of them will be
*12:26.660- 12:33.440* :  killed or injured. The feeling here on the front mirrors the government's mantra of fighting
*12:33.480- 12:36.980* :  for as long as it takes, but it's not the case for everyone.
*12:39.560- 12:44.940* :  Sirens tend to sound wherever you are. In this case, it's Klamatorsk, the eastern city with its
*12:45.300- 12:51.520* :  huge main square. Nice to meet you, James. We're here to meet Ilja. He's been a combat medic
*12:51.520- 12:58.480* :  on the front line for the past two years. I think it would be more effective if military
*12:58.700- 13:06.480* :  recruitment office would say. Guy, you will have a super hard job in infantry, but for example,
*13:06.480- 13:13.440* :  for half a year, then you'll go to next level training and you'll get more specific tasks to do.
*13:17.500- 13:22.980* :  After months of debate, Ukraine's parliament finally passed a new mobilization bill. It includes
*13:22.980- 13:27.900* :  the widening of the conscription age, but it's what it doesn't have which has drawn criticism.
*13:28.400- 13:31.000* :  A limit on how long a soldier has to serve.
*13:34.480- 13:41.340* :  We're in the scenic, obelong district of Kiev by the Nipro River, and we're going for a walk
*13:41.340- 13:49.400* :  within us of Sun, who is an opposition MP, and she abstained on the vote on this mobilization bill.
*13:51.280- 13:57.120* :  We do have people who started serving on day one of the big war. They have already been serving for
*13:58.160- 14:04.800* :  over two years, including my partner, and they are tired, they are exhausted, they are split from
*14:04.800- 14:11.840* :  their families. There are more people who are not serving than those who are serving. So the numbers
*14:11.840- 14:18.440* :  are available. Of course, my understanding is shaped by who I am, by the fact that I, you know,
*14:18.440- 14:24.920* :  spend countless nights worrying about where my partner is if he is okay and so on and so forth.
*14:25.220- 14:30.500* :  It's an anxiety shared by millions of Ukrainians, while tired soldiers are torn between
*14:30.500- 14:33.900* :  needing to defend their country and wanting to go home.
*14:35.500- 14:40.460* :  James Waterhouse in Ukraine. France has reclaimed the world record for the longest
*14:40.460- 14:48.240* :  baguette. It had stood at 132.62 meters set in the Italian city of Komu five years ago.
*14:48.780- 14:54.040* :  On Sunday, 12 French bakers set to work in Paris just before three o'clock in the morning,
*14:54.380- 15:00.940* :  and 13 hours later, after using especially built, slow moving oven on wheels, the baguette was
*15:00.940- 15:07.600* :  complete. Michael de Santos was one of the bakers. We had scares at certain times.
*15:07.660- 15:12.240* :  We had to keep the baguette under surveillance all the way, which was not easy,
*15:12.740- 15:17.440* :  whether during the rise in the oven or during the descent. Even a kneading and shaping,
*15:17.500- 15:24.560* :  everything was very tense. The thin, crisp stick of bread had to be at least five centimeters thick
*15:24.560- 15:31.220* :  with no breakages. Again, this record adjudicator, Joanne Brent, was there to setify the achievement.
*15:31.780- 15:38.780* :  The final measurement is taken by the length of the baguette and with a great huge record
*15:38.780- 15:46.160* :  to beat of 132.63 meters, I can confirm that this attempt has been successful.
*15:46.160- 15:54.620* :  I would like to congratulate you on setting this Guinness World Records title for the longest
*15:54.620- 16:01.800* :  baguette at 140 meters 140.53 meters.
*16:06.260- 16:11.020* :  Ula la, while having beaten the previous record by just under eight meters the baguette,
*16:11.280- 16:17.360* :  around 235 times longer than the traditional French stick, was cut up into small pieces
*16:17.360- 16:23.700* :  and served with chocolate spread. Still to come here on the Global News Podcast,

*18:07.080- 18:12.180* :  vote for a new president after three years of a military transition under General Mohamed Debbie.
*18:12.180- 18:18.540* :  Security, high youth unemployment, poor infrastructure and electricity crisis and a struggling
*18:18.540- 18:24.440* :  economy have been the key campaign issues ahead of the poll. Our correspondent Paul Nijay
*18:24.440- 18:29.840* :  is at a polling station in the capital. I can tell you that the streets of Jamena this morning are
*18:29.840- 18:36.160* :  heavily militarized. Military personnel are patrolling the streets to also protect what they say
*18:36.160- 18:42.460* :  are voters and civilians as well. It's basically you know tight atmospheres, heavy security
*18:42.460- 18:48.040* :  exposition. Everyone getting into the polling station is being searched. And Muhammad himself is
*18:48.040- 18:54.760* :  one of the election contenders. Who is he facing off in this vote? So he's facing nine other candidates
*18:54.960- 18:59.160* :  including his prime minister, success master and former prime minister, Bahimi Padakeh.
*18:59.480- 19:03.820* :  There's also the lone candidate, Lidip Yasemda who are growing in the race. However,
*19:03.820- 19:08.860* :  people say that it is a two-horse race between him and his prime minister who you know they've
*19:08.860- 19:12.640* :  seen the campaign for you. They've been pulling crowds and you know pitching their political
*19:12.640- 19:18.180* :  and social agenda to the population. People say that only the result will tell who of these men
*19:18.860- 19:23.020* :  has the capacity to rule the country even though like critics have said everything has been
*19:23.020- 19:27.880* :  put in place to ensure that the incumbent remains in power. Do people really think that this
*19:27.880- 19:33.420* :  election will count and what are they hoping for afterwards? We've spoken to a number of people
*19:33.420- 19:40.160* :  since we've got here and what we've got is a confluence of hope but also of skepticism and also
*19:40.160- 19:43.560* :  despair. You know on the one side there are people who feel that these elections will help
*19:44.060- 19:49.560* :  setting the country towards democracy. While there are those who say that it is just a perpetuation
*19:49.560- 19:55.820* :  of inertia that there is no clear change that can come out of this ballot giving that some fierce
*19:55.820- 20:02.060* :  critics of the president were bad from running in the election. So some people say that the process
*20:02.060- 20:09.340* :  has not been made a fair for everyone. Pondje speaking to Beverly Ochen. Argentina's new president
*20:09.340- 20:14.360* :  Javier Miele has denied that ordinary people are paying for his radical austerity measures.
*20:14.920- 20:20.300* :  In an interview with the BBC, Ms. Miele who campaigned with the chainsaw to symbolise his desire
*20:20.300- 20:25.920* :  to slash public spending insisted that it was false to suggest the public were bearing the brunt
*20:26.120- 20:31.960* :  of his sharp spending cuts. He also accepted the Falkland Islands were currently in the hands of
*20:31.960- 20:37.920* :  the UK which is notable given past leaders have historically claimed their Argentine. As
*20:37.920- 20:43.100* :  South America correspondent Ioni Wells asked what he would say to a pensioner who told the BBC
*20:43.100- 20:53.420* :  that people like her are paying for his changes. Well actually that is false. The largest
*20:53.420- 21:01.060* :  adjustment is being paid by the political corporation. The impact on pensions is only 0.4%
*21:01.180- 21:06.800* :  of GDP. But I want to know specifically what would you say to people right now would you say sorry
*21:06.800- 21:11.100* :  would you say thank you to the people who are having to pay a lot more than they were previously
*21:11.340- 21:17.780* :  as a result of the adjustment that's happening. The mass media will deliberately lie and people will
*21:17.780- 21:25.140* :  believe those lies they get through the media. You can't make a macroeconomic evaluation based on
*21:25.140- 21:30.860* :  the situation of an individual. There you are taking one of the parts rather than the whole.
*21:31.380- 21:37.360* :  Actually a particular situation may be influenced by the sort of information that the individual
*21:37.360- 21:42.160* :  also has access to. But I think excuse me President and with respect the information people
*21:42.160- 21:46.160* :  have access to is the prices they're seeing in supermarkets. I mean for example do you know how
*21:46.160- 21:53.460* :  much a liter of milk costs now in Buenos Aires? Do you know how many goods assets exist within an
*21:53.460- 22:00.760* :  economy? So you don't do economics based on the price of an individual assets. But I'm sorry I just
*22:00.760- 22:05.180* :  want to make sure we're speaking in terms that normal people will understand because our audience
*22:05.180- 22:10.160* :  people on the streets here are not economists. How does somebody who has seen the price of milk double
*22:10.160- 22:14.880* :  since you came to office what would you say to them specifically the people who are struggling
*22:14.880- 22:19.200* :  and say that they feel like they are paying for the adjustment. Even if you believe it is the
*22:19.200- 22:23.240* :  right one what would be your message to them right now how long should they wait specifically
*22:23.240- 22:30.380* :  for example for things to feel better. In the last month salaries started to be inflation. They
*22:30.380- 22:39.160* :  went up by 14 percent. Inflation was 11 percent. Would the message be in simple terms wait a bit
*22:39.160- 22:43.360* :  longer and how long could you just give me a time frame of how long you'd like people to wait
*22:43.360- 22:50.420* :  who are struggling right now. The first thing is that in economics miracles don't exist. What would
*22:50.420- 22:56.040* :  have been the alternative to continue to print money like the previous administration that generates
*22:56.040- 23:03.240* :  inflation and ends up affecting the most vulnerable. That was not the way to go. You have promised
*23:03.240- 23:10.460* :  Argentines a road map to making the folklands known here as Malvinas Argentine. What specifically
*23:10.460- 23:17.340* :  does that road map look like. We believe that has to be within the framework of peace and as a
*23:17.340- 23:23.420* :  result of a long-term negotiation process we are not going to relinquish our sovereignty.
*23:23.420- 23:30.420* :  Nor are we going to seek conflict with the United Kingdom. What makes you think that the UK
*23:30.420- 23:33.920* :  would agree to that because they've been very clear that they do not want to negotiate this.
*23:34.080- 23:40.620* :  They might not want to negotiate today at some later point they might want to. Many positions
*23:40.620- 23:46.360* :  have changed over time. What kind of time frame would you offer Argentines for that? I think it's
*23:46.440- 23:52.580* :  a long time to go and that is maybe approach in the same way as in the case of China and Hong Kong.
*23:53.500- 23:58.740* :  Argentines new president have a melee talking to our South America correspondent Ioni Wells.
*24:00.040- 24:04.640* :  Suffers in Mexico have been paying tribute to three men whose bodies were found in a well
*24:05.120- 24:09.660* :  after they went missing during a planned holiday. Two of the men who were brothers had traveled
*24:09.660- 24:14.860* :  from Australia to holiday with their friend from the US and the group were camping in a remote
*24:14.860- 24:20.040* :  area. The authorities say that they were all shot in the head. A correspondent Katie Watson
*24:20.300- 24:26.380* :  told me what. The three men Jake and Calam Robinson and an American friend Jack Carter
*24:26.380- 24:32.380* :  road they all disappeared last weekend. They were on a surfing trip in Bacca California and
*24:32.500- 24:38.920* :  what we now know from the Bacca California State Prosecutor is that three bodies were identified.
*24:38.920- 24:45.060* :  They believed the men were attacked. They were trying to stop their pickup truck from being stolen
*24:45.060- 24:50.560* :  apparently the attackers wanted the vehicle for its tires and according to the State Prosecutor
*24:50.880- 24:56.960* :  when they resisted the tourist was shot and their three bodies were found in a deep well close to
*24:56.960- 25:03.880* :  the town of Santo Tomas. There were abandoned tents. Their vehicle was also burnt out. There was
*25:03.880- 25:11.760* :  also a phone that was linked to one of the surfers that was also found nearby and very concerned.
*25:11.760- 25:17.680* :  There's also a fourth body was found in the well not connected to the case but I think it speaks to
*25:17.680- 25:26.280* :  the the violence that we see in Bacca California in a state that is frequented by lots of tourists.
*25:26.280- 25:30.960* :  It's seen as a you know a big destination especially for people from the US coming down south
*25:31.780- 25:36.860* :  but the fact that the violence of course is never far away in a place like Mexico. But how rare is
*25:36.860- 25:41.820* :  this kind of attack on foreigners? Well it's really I mean it's taken people by surprise in fact there
*25:41.820- 25:48.760* :  was a group of you know the surfing community came out to say they needed more security. I mean look
*25:48.900- 25:55.260* :  it's Mexico. Bacca California is a violent state. There were drugs gangs. There's a turf war going on
*25:55.260- 26:01.220* :  you know in many states this is a huge concern but at the same time the fact that it's got you
*26:01.220- 26:07.840* :  great surfing conditions. It's seen as safe in terms of a huge tourist destination. It's what
*26:07.840- 26:14.900* :  just around a hundred kilometers south of the US Mexico border so it's clearly a destination
*26:15.000- 26:20.360* :  but the fact that there is you know that there is this kind of side-by-side the tourism plus
*26:20.840- 26:28.700* :  violence is of course a huge concern and yes the state prosecutor has said that this is these
*26:28.700- 26:34.680* :  were people who wanted to rob the tourist but they haven't ruled out organized violence and I
*26:34.680- 26:40.520* :  think it's very hard to rule out in Mexico and certainly you know in Bacca California. And there have
*26:40.520- 26:46.440* :  been arrests haven't there. Three people have been arrested one woman and her partner and his brother
*26:46.860- 26:52.500* :  one of the men has is facing a forced disappearance charge he's also got a history of drug dealing
*26:52.500- 26:59.420* :  domestic violence, vehicle theft as well and the woman was allegedly found with the mobile phone
*26:59.420- 27:05.860* :  belonging to one of the Australian men but they're also confident that more than three people were
*27:05.860- 27:11.860* :  involved in the attack on the tourists. Katie Watson. California Dreaming Monday,
*27:11.900- 27:17.580* :  Dream a little dream with their distinctive four-part vocal harmonies the mothers and the
*27:17.580- 27:22.760* :  puppets at some of the most memorable hits of the mid-1960s. A crucial part of their success
*27:22.760- 27:29.360* :  was Mama Cass Elliott. In July it will be the 50th anniversary of her death at the age of 32.
*27:29.500- 27:35.640* :  Ever since people have incorrectly claimed that her death was caused by choking on a ham sandwich
*27:35.640- 27:41.520* :  but now her daughter Owen Elliott Kugel has written a book to try and make sure people know the truth.
*27:41.840- 27:45.240* :  She's been speaking to our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
*27:47.900- 27:52.020* :  The truth is that there was a ham sandwich but she didn't eat it and she didn't choke on it.
*27:56.340- 28:03.200* :  This is an attempt to write a rock wrong. For 50 years it's been said and repeat that the death
*28:03.200- 28:10.640* :  of Mama Cass Elliott from the mamas and the papas was linked to a sandwich. Her daughter Owen
*28:10.640- 28:16.760* :  Elliott Kugel has written a memoir called My Mama Cass which aims to correct this inaccuracy
*28:17.100- 28:24.700* :  and reclaim her mother's story. She told everybody that she was going to be the most famous
*28:24.700- 28:33.600* :  fat girl that ever lived. Monday Monday was a US number one for the mamas and the papas but by
*28:33.600- 28:40.340* :  July 1974 Cass Elliott was an established solo artist and it just finished a two-week run at the
*28:40.340- 28:45.340* :  London palladium when her death at the age of 32 made headlines around the world.
*28:45.640- 28:50.920* :  Cass died of natural causes. There was no evidence that she'd been taking drugs or that she'd
*28:50.920- 28:56.160* :  been drinking. Cass Elliott had been up for 36 hours straight. She went to Mick Jagger's birthday
*28:56.160- 29:01.720* :  party and then stayed up all night and then there was a brunch thrown in her honor and then there
*29:01.720- 29:06.160* :  was a tea thrown in her honor the next day and by the time she got back to her flat it was six o'clock.
*29:07.520- 29:13.300* :  The following day you know and she was hungry and her dancer made her a sandwich from the only
*29:13.300- 29:20.120* :  thing that was in the flat, ham and left it on her bedside table and she never ate she never even
*29:26.380- 29:29.820* :  took a bite. It was one of the things that really bothered me the most even as a little girl.
*29:33.120- 29:36.820* :  The little kids that I was hanging out with my friends at school they didn't know who my mom was
*29:36.820- 29:41.920* :  or any of that stuff but I would go home to have play dates with some of these kids and it was
*29:42.160- 29:46.380* :  kind of frequent that one of their parents would make a comment to me like you know hey did your
*29:46.380- 29:51.920* :  mom really die choking on a ham sandwich. It was such a horrible story and I knew that it wasn't true.
*29:51.920- 29:58.500* :  I knew that she had died of a heart attack and it just felt so cruel to have a rumor like that
*29:58.500- 30:09.280* :  perpetuated. Even in her own band songs and during her many appearances on US TV Variety shows
*30:09.460- 30:15.720* :  Casselia's weight was used as a punchline. Even though she was grinning and bearing it through all
*30:15.720- 30:21.380* :  the fat jokes they hurt. Nowadays fat shaming is treated in a completely different way how
*30:21.380- 30:26.820* :  different would have been for your mom if she was starting out in this environment. Why they would
*30:26.820- 30:31.480* :  have been completely different but that's because there was somebody like a Casselia to kind of
*30:31.480- 30:38.800* :  pave the way for these other young ladies to be accepted for who they are. She was a trailblazer.
*30:39.040- 30:42.860* :  I really do believe that she helped lay that groundwork for a lot of people.
*30:48.480- 30:54.580* :  I remember her with that last image that I have of her putting me on the plane and putting my seat belt
*30:54.580- 31:02.340* :  on and giving me kisses on both cheeks and watching her through the airplane window waving bye-bye
*31:02.340- 31:13.720* :  and that's bye-bye and she's gone. The voice of Cass Elliot ending that report by Colin Patterson.
