*01:19.220- 01:22.220* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.100- 01:30.200* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Saturday 11th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:30.840- 01:34.800* :  The United Nations has voted to enhance Palestine's membership rights.
*01:35.540- 01:41.100* :  Russia has launched a cross-border attack near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and two
*01:41.100- 01:46.480* :  British climate protesters in their 80s have been arrested after smashing the glass case
*01:46.480- 01:48.740* :  containing a historically legal document.
*01:51.940- 01:56.740* :  Also in this podcast, it's taken almost three months, longer than I thought, because
*01:56.740- 02:02.340* :  my audience is not normal, my audience is tax nerds and lawyers, the kind of weirdos
*02:02.340- 02:03.720* :  who do actually read the small print.
*02:04.080- 02:09.460* :  A free bottle of wine hidden in a website's small print has finally been claimed after
*02:09.460- 02:12.980* :  three months by someone who bothered to read the terms and conditions.
*02:18.140- 02:22.920* :  It's perhaps yet another sign of Israel's growing isolation on the international stage,
*02:23.340- 02:24.960* :  with a war in Gaza continuing.
*02:25.360- 02:30.540* :  The United Nations General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly to grant Palestine enhanced
*02:30.540- 02:35.360* :  rights within the organisation, and it's called for it to be accepted as a full member,
*02:35.820- 02:40.120* :  and this comes amid reports that several more European countries plan officially to
*02:40.120- 02:42.160* :  recognise Palestine as a state.
*02:42.880- 02:46.640* :  There was not surprisingly a furious response to the vote from Israel.
*02:47.060- 02:48.860* :  Indeed, a rather graphic one.
*02:49.080- 02:55.100* :  It's envoy to the UN, Gillard Erdan, used a mini shredder to destroy a small copy of
*02:55.100- 02:56.660* :  the United Nations charter.
*02:57.500- 03:05.020* :  Today, I will hold up a mirror for you, so that you can see exactly what you are inflicting
*03:05.020- 03:09.440* :  upon the UN Charter with this destructive vote.
*03:12.920- 03:17.440* :  You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands.
*03:18.380- 03:20.240* :  Yes, yes, that's what you are doing.
*03:20.380- 03:23.320* :  Shredding the UN Charter, shame on you.
*03:24.020- 03:28.780* :  United Nations debates have often been rather fiery, but there's still merits as one of
*03:28.780- 03:33.180* :  the organisation's more dramatic moments, according to our correspondent in New York John
*03:33.180- 03:33.800* :  Sudworth.
*03:34.300- 03:38.580* :  Indeed, he told Jeanette Joliel, it's one which may well go down in the history books.
*03:39.420- 03:44.180* :  First off, we can say that to the acts of protest on the floor of the General Assembly
*03:44.180- 03:48.420* :  over the years, including, of course, Nikita Khrushchev's infamous shoe banging incident,
*03:48.420- 03:51.860* :  we can now add the use of the mini shredder.
*03:52.100- 03:58.260* :  This was a day of some pretty striking language in the debate and some pretty striking scenes.
*03:58.940- 04:05.200* :  It all comes, of course, after the rejection of the bid for full Palestinian membership
*04:05.200- 04:11.760* :  last month, that was rejected by the Security Council over the US use of its veto, and this
*04:11.760- 04:16.060* :  is, if you like, in essence, the General Assembly taking matters into its own hands.
*04:16.640- 04:21.500* :  We ought to say that the General Assembly does not have the power to confer full membership
*04:21.500- 04:22.380* :  to Palestine.
*04:22.660- 04:27.260* :  That is a power that only belongs to the Security Council, so this was largely symbolic.
*04:27.260- 04:33.460* :  The resolution reiterated the call for that to be done, but it does also make a few material
*04:33.460- 04:34.240* :  changes.
*04:34.740- 04:41.600* :  It does confer on Palestine in its non-member observer status a few extra rights and privileges.
*04:41.600- 04:47.300* :  So for example, this vote going through today will mean that Palestine will now enjoy the
*04:47.300- 04:51.460* :  ability to take part in pretty much all debates, which it didn't have before, that it'll
*04:51.460- 04:55.840* :  be able to propose agenda items, and it will be able to get its representatives nominated
*04:55.840- 05:03.160* :  to committees, and all of that was enough for the Israeli ambassador to see this as a breach
*05:03.160- 05:08.680* :  of the UN Charter, as an attempt to confer many of the attributes of state that on Palestine
*05:08.680- 05:13.880* :  through the back door, and that's why we saw him shredding this pocket-sized version
*05:13.880- 05:17.680* :  of the UN Charter, pushing it through that little mini shredder that he brought up with
*05:17.680- 05:18.320* :  him to the podium.
*05:19.000- 05:24.180* :  And despite Israel's protests, Palestinians are getting more support from across the world
*05:24.180- 05:29.560* :  since the war broke out in October the 7th, and with reports of some European countries
*05:29.560- 05:32.620* :  are planning to recognize a Palestinian state.
*05:32.980- 05:38.900* :  Yeah, that's right, 143 members of the General Assembly voting in favor of this resolution.
*05:38.900- 05:44.180* :  Many of them, of course, already have formally recognized Palestinian statehood, but a lot
*05:44.180- 05:50.400* :  of people arguing for this today because they see it as a potential watershed to encourage
*05:51.020- 05:52.360* :  more to do so.
*05:52.860- 05:57.160* :  You know, some pretty impassioned speeches on both sides are retrenchment in many ways
*05:57.160- 06:00.140* :  of familiar positions from many of the nations involved.
*06:00.620- 06:06.540* :  The United States backing Israel, saying that in its view that statehood and the status
*06:07.120- 06:11.320* :  that would be accorded by full membership of the United Nations, should not come before
*06:11.320- 06:12.200* :  a peace process.
*06:12.200- 06:15.240* :  That all this needs to be worked out following a peace process.
*06:15.280- 06:21.200* :  And those arguing in favor of this motion today, suggesting that after 85 years the time
*06:21.200- 06:24.680* :  has come, even if this gesture is symbolic to stand behind it.
*06:25.060- 06:30.160* :  John Sudworth, with all this drama going on at the UN, the United States government has
*06:30.160- 06:35.560* :  said that Israel may have used American supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian
*06:35.560- 06:37.680* :  law during the war in Gaza.
*06:38.000- 06:42.260* :  The findings came in a review ordered by the White House, our correspondent Tom Bateman
*06:42.260- 06:43.060* :  is in Washington.
*06:43.580- 06:47.000* :  This has been a very long awaited report by the State Department.
*06:47.000- 06:52.720* :  It was ordered by President Biden back in February under increasing pressure over the allegations
*06:52.720- 06:56.660* :  that Israel had breached international humanitarian law in Gaza.
*06:57.020- 07:00.360* :  The administration has actually missed its own deadline by three days on this.
*07:00.360- 07:05.420* :  Such was the pressure it says it put itself under to try and get this absolutely right.
*07:05.420- 07:11.560* :  Now, what the document says is that it makes a reasonable assessment that Israel may have
*07:11.560- 07:15.960* :  breached international humanitarian law in some instances in Gaza.
*07:16.380- 07:17.360* :  But it caveats that.
*07:17.360- 07:19.580* :  It says it doesn't have complete information.
*07:19.960- 07:24.500* :  And also, it believes that Israel does have mechanisms to try to bring accountability
*07:24.500- 07:27.600* :  to sort of remediate all of these instances.
*07:27.600- 07:33.760* :  But the bottom line is that this report is critical of Israel's actions in Gaza, albeit
*07:33.760- 07:37.020* :  in a rather sort of broad and non-specific way.
*07:37.580- 07:42.220* :  And fundamentally, it stops short of going to the full extent of the power that the president
*07:42.220- 07:48.120* :  has on this particular issue, which is to withhold weapons shipments if the assessment
*07:48.120- 07:52.660* :  is that there is a clear case that international humanitarian law has been breached.
*07:52.940- 07:59.640* :  So it doesn't say that there should be any further holding of US weapons to Israel coming
*07:59.640- 08:03.980* :  in a week, of course, where the president confirmed that one armed shipment has already
*08:04.360- 08:05.500* :  been halted to the Israelis.
*08:05.860- 08:12.480* :  So, a controversial report unveiled in Washington, a particularly bitter row at the United Nations
*08:12.480- 08:13.920* :  headquarters in New York.
*08:14.520- 08:19.460* :  But meanwhile, the UN's agency in Jerusalem has also been going through some high drama.
*08:20.000- 08:24.420* :  Unroa looks after Palestinians who fled to Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
*08:24.900- 08:29.480* :  But it's had to close its Jerusalem office after being the target of an arson attack.
*08:29.760- 08:34.460* :  The head of Unroa blamed what he called Israeli extremists, who have been holding regular
*08:34.460- 08:36.440* :  protests outside its compound.
*08:36.740- 08:41.600* :  This follows an accusation by the Israeli government that several Unroa workers were
*08:41.600- 08:46.320* :  involved in the Hamas attacks of October 7th, though an independent review found that
*08:46.320- 08:49.020* :  Israel still hadn't supplied any evidence for this.
*08:49.500- 08:52.180* :  James Menendez spoke to Unroa's Jonathan Fowler.
*08:52.420- 08:55.220* :  He was actually in the compound when the fire started.
*08:55.940- 08:57.360* :  There were a number of us still in the office.
*08:57.360- 09:00.460* :  This was around 6pm or all there are about.
*09:00.500- 09:05.940* :  And suddenly we heard the fire alarms and then started to see smoke coming over the rooftop
*09:05.940- 09:07.320* :  of the building we're in.
*09:07.420- 09:10.800* :  And it was immediately clear that the smoke was coming from the edge of the compound.
*09:10.820- 09:12.900* :  Colleagues rushed out to see what was happening.
*09:13.180- 09:17.980* :  And there's sort of uncut grass and so on on the outside of the fence of the compound.
*09:18.340- 09:21.780* :  And clearly, persons unknown had set fire to it.
*09:21.780- 09:25.180* :  And at this point, the flames were taking hold and the fire service was called.
*09:25.180- 09:29.720* :  But in the meantime, a couple of colleagues got the host pipe and some fire extinguishes
*09:29.720- 09:32.120* :  to try and contain either end of the fire.
*09:32.320- 09:35.200* :  And while they were trying to put the fire out, they were youths who were watching
*09:35.200- 09:37.360* :  from across the road who started throwing stones at them.
*09:37.500- 09:42.240* :  We have seen these groups of young people around the compound before.
*09:42.240- 09:46.940* :  I mean, they regularly gather around the time colleagues are leaving at the end of the working day
*09:46.940- 09:50.440* :  to throw stones at the vehicles, throw stones at individuals who are trying to leave.
*09:50.520- 09:52.100* :  We kind of recognised who they were.
*09:52.340- 09:54.080* :  And these were clearly Israeli kids.
*09:54.340- 09:58.840* :  Very, very young sort of, you know, 13, 14, 15, but there were a number of older people with them.
*09:58.960- 10:02.440* :  But there's no doubt in your mind that the fire was started deliberately.
*10:02.940- 10:06.860* :  Oh, that's absolutely clear, because another one then popped up on the other side of the compound.
*10:07.160- 10:11.600* :  So one, yes, who knows, but the second one, you know, clearly, I mean, when there's two fires,
*10:11.600- 10:14.900* :  you know, the second one was was actually much more dangerous
*10:14.900- 10:18.060* :  because it was on the edge of the compound where we have our petrol station.
*10:18.260- 10:21.380* :  All these protests that you talk about and they have happened before.
*10:21.780- 10:25.560* :  This is all related to your work in Gaza and the government's assertion
*10:25.600- 10:30.260* :  that UNR has been infiltrated by Hamas, do you think?
*10:30.620- 10:34.920* :  To an extent, I mean, put it this way, there's a lot of fiery rhetoric
*10:34.920- 10:40.640* :  and then, you know, you can draw a direct line between that and somebody literally lighting a fire.
*10:40.640- 10:44.060* :  I mean, there's been a number of accusations against UNR.
*10:44.380- 10:47.660* :  They're in the past, you know, and of course, they've reached a sharper pitch
*10:47.660- 10:52.100* :  over the course of the war in Gaza, but unsubstantiated for the most part.
*10:52.360- 10:54.900* :  I mean, Philippe Lazareini, the Commissioner-General of UNR,
*10:54.900- 10:59.040* :  has repeatedly flagged the fact that there's an overall campaign to dismantle our work
*10:59.180- 11:03.200* :  and that's ranged from stuff about what's going on in Gaza through to, you know,
*11:03.200- 11:07.080* :  the tragic attacks on our facilities in Gaza, the killing of our staff.
*11:07.080- 11:10.480* :  Now, these are sort of all manifestations of a wider effort, you know,
*11:10.480- 11:13.600* :  we've had issues with VAT, we've had bank accounts frozen.
*11:13.880- 11:16.900* :  But the demonstrations that they've been turning up the dial, generally,
*11:16.900- 11:19.500* :  these demonstrations, more or less peaceful,
*11:20.100- 11:22.640* :  but we've had staff had these toy guns pointed at them.
*11:22.640- 11:25.380* :  We've had people putting bloodied handprints on our walls.
*11:26.040- 11:29.060* :  So, did the police ever come to this protest?
*11:29.260- 11:30.300* :  Do they ever intervene?
*11:30.700- 11:32.840* :  Earlier on, when the protests were first happening,
*11:32.840- 11:36.220* :  the police actually came and they set up barriers and did all these kind of things.
*11:36.480- 11:38.460* :  You know, so it was much more police, if you like,
*11:38.460- 11:42.400* :  but over the recent occurrences, these demonstrators kind of come back
*11:42.400- 11:46.160* :  and more or less weekly, the police action, if you like, is almost declined
*11:46.160- 11:50.180* :  as the level of violence and intimidation has actually grown.
*11:50.800- 11:52.780* :  Unruh Ahsperksman, Jonathan Fowler,
*11:53.120- 11:56.460* :  the BBC asked for comments from the Israeli foreign ministry and police
*11:56.460- 11:59.340* :  regarding the incident, but nobody's got back to us.
*11:59.360- 12:02.940* :  Meanwhile, the European Union foreign policy chief, Joseph Barrel,
*12:03.320- 12:05.980* :  said that the bloc strongly condemns the attack.
*12:05.980- 12:10.660* :  He said it was Israel's responsibility to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers.
*12:11.720- 12:14.700* :  Now, Russian forces have launched a cross-border attack
*12:14.700- 12:18.160* :  near Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv in the northeast of the country,
*12:18.760- 12:23.160* :  opening a potential new front in the war that's long been waged in the east and south.
*12:23.160- 12:27.160* :  President Zelensky says a fierce battle is now being waged there.
*12:29.540- 12:33.340* :  Russia started a new wave of offensive actions in the Kharkiv region.
*12:33.340- 12:37.740* :  Ukrainian forces met them there with brigades and artillery fire.
*12:38.120- 12:40.280* :  It's important to understand that they can increase
*12:40.280- 12:43.040* :  and bring more forces in these directions.
*12:43.560- 12:44.280* :  It is a fact.
*12:44.980- 12:47.900* :  Reports suggest that Russian troops have made some advances,
*12:48.540- 12:50.760* :  but Ukraine says they have been pushed back.
*12:50.940- 12:53.680* :  Our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel is in Kharkiv.
*12:54.080- 12:57.320* :  The Russian attack, he says, certainly didn't come as a surprise.
*12:58.360- 13:01.420* :  I think if you talk to Ukrainians and certainly Western intelligence,
*13:01.420- 13:05.420* :  officials I've spoken to, they knew that Russia was building up forces
*13:06.780- 13:07.740* :  just over the border.
*13:07.740- 13:12.400* :  But Russia's focus has been in the east this year, this year alone.
*13:12.600- 13:17.300* :  It has already taken about 300 square miles of Ukrainian territory
*13:17.300- 13:20.100* :  making slow but steady progress.
*13:21.060- 13:24.960* :  But this attack, so they've been massing troops just over the border,
*13:25.600- 13:28.680* :  and this is essentially a new front for this year.
*13:29.400- 13:32.760* :  And those troops in small numbers, as you say, cross the border,
*13:32.760- 13:37.260* :  followed by massive in Ukraine's words, artillery and air strikes,
*13:37.260- 13:40.660* :  and that those troops, those small numbers of Russian troops,
*13:41.220- 13:43.860* :  have now got a foothold just across the border.
*13:43.860- 13:45.920* :  Now, it doesn't threaten this city.
*13:45.920- 13:51.580* :  This is Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv in terms of Russia at the gates,
*13:51.580- 13:54.440* :  which it was at the start of this war.
*13:54.760- 13:58.880* :  But remember, this city is pretty much being targeted every single night
*13:58.880- 14:02.100* :  by Russian air strikes and missile strikes.
*14:02.100- 14:08.300* :  Indeed, there's been an air alarm warning since 9 a.m. still going on now here.
*14:08.820- 14:14.480* :  But it does show that Russia is stretching Ukraine right across this 800 mile front
*14:14.480- 14:17.640* :  in the south, now in the north, and also in the east,
*14:17.640- 14:20.040* :  where it's made its most significant gains.
*14:20.100- 14:24.640* :  It's clear that President Putin believes he has this window of opportunity
*14:24.640- 14:28.180* :  in the coming months to make some significant gains.
*14:28.520- 14:29.500* :  That's what he hopes.
*14:30.100- 14:33.920* :  And that situation of Ukraine being at guns and at manned
*14:34.200- 14:38.460* :  has been exacerbated by that slow U.S. military support.
*14:38.460- 14:41.240* :  It took six months for it to be approved,
*14:41.240- 14:43.460* :  and it is only now slowly arriving.
*14:43.460- 14:46.240* :  So, Ukraine is really being tested,
*14:46.920- 14:50.060* :  and it is now facing an attack on numerous fronts.
*14:50.820- 14:52.180* :  Jonathan Bielin Kharkiv.
*14:52.840- 14:53.920* :  And now to India.
*14:58.860- 15:02.840* :  The sounds of jubilant supporters greeting the chief minister of Delhi,
*15:02.840- 15:05.380* :  Arvin Keshrawal, as he walked out of prison.
*15:06.120- 15:08.320* :  A leading opponent of the Indian Prime Minister,
*15:08.800- 15:12.540* :  Mr. Keshawwal has been granted temporary bail in a corruption case.
*15:13.080- 15:14.980* :  India is in the middle of general elections,
*15:14.980- 15:16.940* :  which take place over six weeks.
*15:17.480- 15:21.040* :  At his incarceration had meant Mr. Keshawwal couldn't take part.
*15:21.040- 15:23.860* :  He said India was sliding into being a dictatorship.
*15:24.720- 15:26.600* :  But speaking outside, the Supreme Court,
*15:26.600- 15:30.880* :  his lawyer Shadan Farasad confirmed that his client would now be free to campaign.
*15:31.520- 15:33.460* :  The court indicated that their granting
*15:34.020- 15:36.620* :  interim release slashed Biel to Mr. Arvin Keshrawal.
*15:37.340- 15:40.100* :  And that order of interim release will be operable
*15:40.400- 15:41.740* :  up till second of June,
*15:42.080- 15:43.480* :  that is during the election process.
*15:43.480- 15:47.460* :  And there is no restriction on his campaigning
*15:47.460- 15:49.940* :  as to what he can say, what he cannot say,
*15:50.460- 15:53.680* :  during while he is out in these 20-22 days.
*15:54.320- 15:57.120* :  Mr. Keshawwal isn't actually standing in this election.
*15:57.700- 15:59.440* :  But as our South Asia regional editor,
*15:59.440- 16:02.000* :  Ambassador Nethirajan told Janet Jalil,
*16:02.440- 16:05.340* :  his presence on the campaign trail could still be important.
*16:06.280- 16:10.380* :  Well, Delhi Chief Minister Arvin Keshrawal is one of the important leaders
*16:10.380- 16:11.920* :  of the opposition alliance.
*16:12.680- 16:15.180* :  He became very popular 10-12 years ago
*16:15.180- 16:17.680* :  by launching this anti-corruption movement.
*16:17.680- 16:21.640* :  And that's what brought him to the political field.
*16:21.640- 16:23.760* :  And he's a very popular leader in Delhi.
*16:24.300- 16:26.520* :  And also he's party, the Amadmi parties
*16:26.520- 16:28.340* :  and power in the state of Punjab.
*16:29.020- 16:32.460* :  And his arrest in March stunned many people
*16:32.460- 16:34.740* :  because that was quite unprecedented
*16:34.740- 16:37.800* :  in opposition leader, a sitting Chief Minister of State,
*16:38.280- 16:41.080* :  was being taken into custody on corruption charges.
*16:41.720- 16:43.420* :  And he denies all those accusations.
*16:44.000- 16:46.940* :  But now the Indian Supreme Court has given him temporary bail
*16:46.940- 16:49.320* :  so that he can campaign in the ongoing election,
*16:49.320- 16:51.440* :  which has been going on for weeks.
*16:51.980- 16:55.040* :  So this is seen as a big boost for the opposition alliance.
*16:55.500- 16:58.420* :  The BJP, the governing party in India
*16:58.920- 17:00.480* :  off Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
*17:01.020- 17:03.240* :  And many analysts and experts,
*17:03.240- 17:05.940* :  they've predict a victory for the BJP
*17:05.940- 17:08.140* :  because it is seen as quite strong.
*17:08.300- 17:11.060* :  And Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister himself is very popular.
*17:11.280- 17:12.940* :  And he himself is very popular.
*17:12.940- 17:16.380* :  And it's widely expected that he's going to win another term.
*17:16.380- 17:18.640* :  But again, within the Indian public,
*17:18.880- 17:22.340* :  you can't say anything very conclusive until it happens
*17:22.340- 17:25.340* :  because when I was in India a couple of weeks ago,
*17:25.340- 17:29.420* :  what I saw was there is no anti or pro wave
*17:29.420- 17:30.780* :  of anything among the public.
*17:30.840- 17:32.860* :  There's a kind of very quiet, very uneasiness.
*17:32.860- 17:35.820* :  So anything can happen on the Fourth of June.
*17:36.040- 17:39.240* :  And it was very striking that he used that word dictatorship
*17:39.240- 17:42.660* :  because we always describe India as the world's biggest democracy.
*17:43.500- 17:46.520* :  How real are those fears of dictatorship?
*17:46.620- 17:48.700* :  Because a lot of people have talked about Mr. Modi's
*17:48.720- 17:50.180* :  authoritarian tendencies.
*17:51.100- 17:53.460* :  All these opposition parties in the part of this alliance,
*17:53.460- 17:56.520* :  they accuse the government of what they call
*17:56.520- 18:01.460* :  as undeclared emergency, meaning basically no media rights,
*18:01.460- 18:03.480* :  no rights for many of these politicians,
*18:04.140- 18:05.460* :  and also social activists.
*18:05.560- 18:08.160* :  And they point out how many of them have been in jail
*18:08.160- 18:09.860* :  for years without a trial.
*18:10.420- 18:13.360* :  And how even this media, most media,
*18:13.360- 18:16.660* :  what they describe as go-de-media, like laptop media,
*18:17.080- 18:19.380* :  of supporting the government, what they say
*18:19.420- 18:21.800* :  is there is no level playing field for the opposition.
*18:22.400- 18:24.620* :  And because sometimes their advertisements
*18:24.620- 18:26.220* :  are not taken by the newspapers.
*18:26.880- 18:30.720* :  On the other side, when the governing BJP leaders,
*18:30.720- 18:34.360* :  including Prime Minister Modi, what they call as hate speech
*18:34.360- 18:37.680* :  by Mr. Modi, whenever they complain to the election commission,
*18:38.100- 18:41.140* :  hardly any action is being taken against the governing party.
*18:41.600- 18:43.520* :  So this is what the opposition is calling.
*18:43.520- 18:45.880* :  There is no level playing field.
*18:46.300- 18:48.800* :  On the other hand, the BJP government
*18:48.800- 18:50.400* :  and the leaders point out that there
*18:50.400- 18:54.300* :  is a vibrant election campaign going on with both sides
*18:54.660- 18:57.000* :  being allowed to campaign in different places
*18:57.000- 18:58.040* :  without any fear.
*18:58.440- 19:00.560* :  So these accusations of election commission
*19:00.580- 19:03.020* :  being in a partial towards their government
*19:03.020- 19:05.500* :  is all in like we reject all those accusations.
*19:06.120- 19:09.440* :  Ambarassan Ethirajan, we've had plenty of news
*19:09.440- 19:11.920* :  about unusual weather these past few years,
*19:11.920- 19:15.140* :  climate change producing some unprecedented extremes.
*19:16.000- 19:18.200* :  But now it seems something else is on the way.
*19:18.400- 19:19.800* :  Rare if not unique.
*19:19.800- 19:22.320* :  For the first time in nearly 20 years,
*19:22.700- 19:27.160* :  we're being warned to expect a severe solar or geomagnetic storm.
*19:27.900- 19:30.360* :  This is when giant plumes of magnetized
*19:30.360- 19:32.940* :  and electrically charged particles or plasma
*19:33.440- 19:35.680* :  leave the sun and head towards Earth.
*19:36.000- 19:38.620* :  Now, despite its rather ominous sounding name,
*19:39.100- 19:41.520* :  a geomagnetic storm is nothing to worry about
*19:41.520- 19:44.220* :  that it can sometimes affect satellite communications
*19:44.480- 19:45.580* :  and power systems.
*19:46.260- 19:49.240* :  On the plus side, it may provide a very good chance
*19:49.240- 19:52.480* :  to see the celestial display known as the Northern Lights.
*19:52.980- 19:55.100* :  Catherine Regan is a planetary scientist
*19:55.100- 19:57.240* :  at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory,
*19:57.260- 19:59.080* :  part of the University of London.
*19:59.500- 20:01.420* :  She explained what was actually happening
*20:01.420- 20:02.720* :  on the solar surface.
*20:03.520- 20:06.180* :  There's just a lot more activity going on at the sun.
*20:06.780- 20:10.220* :  So there's lots of sun spots which are on the sun at the moment.
*20:10.220- 20:12.860* :  So if you're lucky enough to have a pair of a clip splashes,
*20:13.300- 20:14.880* :  you can actually look at the sun
*20:14.920- 20:16.740* :  and see these sun spots through your glasses.
*20:17.360- 20:19.320* :  And these sun spots are often associated
*20:20.320- 20:22.600* :  with types of events which are called solar flares.
*20:23.120- 20:25.640* :  And when you get really intense solar flares,
*20:25.780- 20:28.820* :  which is where you get big releases of light from the sun,
*20:29.360- 20:33.660* :  these are accompanied by coronal mass ejections or CMEs.
*20:33.980- 20:37.300* :  And this is where you get very heavy release of plasma,
*20:37.900- 20:40.780* :  which is very energetic ionized gas.
*20:41.440- 20:44.660* :  So this big release of plasma from the sun erupts
*20:44.700- 20:46.780* :  and goes through into the solar system.
*20:47.240- 20:50.320* :  And at the moment, lots of these events have been released
*20:50.680- 20:52.460* :  and they are in the path of Earth.
*20:52.500- 20:53.980* :  So they are heading our way at the moment.
*20:53.980- 20:57.040* :  But we're expecting them to arrive this evening.
*20:57.080- 21:00.680* :  But the events on the surface, the sun started between 8 and 9.
*21:00.680- 21:01.940* :  So a couple of days ago,
*21:02.360- 21:05.320* :  these events aren't going to have a huge impact here on Earth.
*21:05.360- 21:07.480* :  So the biggest impact they may have
*21:07.900- 21:10.720* :  would be potentially a few radio blackouts.
*21:11.080- 21:12.240* :  At the moment, it's not predicted
*21:12.240- 21:13.800* :  it's going to impact our power system.
*21:13.800- 21:15.180* :  There shouldn't be any power cuts.
*21:15.820- 21:18.620* :  And our satellites in space may be slightly affected.
*21:18.620- 21:21.320* :  So their navigation may be skewed.
*21:21.320- 21:22.940* :  So they might have to do a few corrections
*21:23.140- 21:25.700* :  to make sure our satellites are going where they're meant to be.
*21:26.120- 21:27.680* :  But it's not going to cause any panic.
*21:28.060- 21:29.720* :  The GPS systems aren't going to go down.
*21:29.740- 21:30.880* :  The power is not going to go out.
*21:31.060- 21:32.660* :  There just may be a few radio blackouts.
*21:33.200- 21:35.000* :  Catherine Riegan, a planetary scientist
*21:35.000- 21:37.100* :  at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory.
*21:40.320- 21:40.960* :  Still to come.
*21:41.720- 21:44.180* :  This is the pip or the beep we call it.
*21:44.480- 21:45.420* :  Then I added this.
*21:46.060- 21:48.920* :  The baseline gives the sense of strength
*21:49.500- 21:50.700* :  and solidity and death.
*21:51.480- 21:53.580* :  The BBC television news theme music
*21:53.580- 21:56.920* :  known by millions around the world is 25 years old.
*22:05.100- 22:05.820* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*22:05.820- 22:08.280* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team
*22:08.280- 22:11.020* :  if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices
*22:11.020- 22:11.900* :  due to inflation.
*22:12.320- 22:12.900* :  They said yes.
*22:13.320- 22:15.020* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically
*22:15.020- 22:17.320* :  violates those owners to your contracts,
*22:17.320- 22:19.660* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*22:19.660- 22:21.300* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*22:21.540- 22:23.980* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited
*22:23.980- 22:26.860* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*23:05.580- 23:08.200* :  H-E-L-P
*23:10.720- 23:12.600* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*23:13.440- 23:16.120* :  A couple of years ago, Pope Francis hit the headlines
*23:16.120- 23:19.020* :  for suggesting that people who choose to have pets
*23:19.020- 23:21.880* :  rather than children were acting selfishly.
*23:22.460- 23:24.180* :  Well, now he's returned to the theme again,
*23:24.180- 23:26.840* :  though, this time without reference to cats and dogs.
*23:27.360- 23:30.860* :  Speaking at a conference on the demographic crisis in Europe,
*23:31.320- 23:34.860* :  the Pope bimonde societies which he said value material
*23:34.860- 23:37.760* :  objects over children and he called on governments
*23:37.760- 23:40.420* :  to do more to encourage couples to have babies
*23:40.420- 23:43.900* :  to reverse the falling birth rate as Mark Lohan reports.
*23:44.820- 23:48.840* :  This was an 87-year-old Pope putting the child center stage.
*23:49.380- 23:50.980* :  Sitting beside a group of young people,
*23:50.980- 23:53.400* :  Pope Francis warned that Europe was becoming
*23:53.400- 23:56.460* :  an old, tired, and resigned continent.
*23:57.220- 24:00.140* :  In Italy, the demographic crisis is particularly acute.
*24:00.700- 24:02.640* :  The birth rate has dropped to a record low
*24:02.640- 24:04.960* :  and its population is one of the world's oldest.
*24:05.580- 24:07.560* :  The Pope said governments needed policies
*24:07.560- 24:11.460* :  to allow women not to have to choose between work and family,
*24:11.960- 24:14.800* :  and he hit out at what he said was harming humanity.
*24:15.300- 24:19.200* :  In this moment, the investment...
*24:19.560- 24:21.440* :  In this moment, the most profitable investments
*24:21.440- 24:23.900* :  are the weapons industry and contraceptives.
*24:24.180- 24:27.060* :  The first destroys life, the second obstructs it.
*24:27.720- 24:29.440* :  These are the most profitable investments.
*24:30.120- 24:31.380* :  What future do we have ahead?
*24:31.960- 24:32.540* :  It's ugly.
*24:35.260- 24:37.080* :  The Italian Prime Minister, George Melloni,
*24:37.080- 24:39.400* :  has called the birth rate problem a priority,
*24:39.920- 24:42.980* :  though some financial measures she's taken so far to tackle it
*24:43.240- 24:45.580* :  haven't yet born fruit with annual births
*24:45.640- 24:47.460* :  in their 15th straight decline.
*24:48.080- 24:50.280* :  But much of Europe, from Portugal to Poland,
*24:50.280- 24:51.780* :  is struggling with this issue,
*24:52.160- 24:55.440* :  with the rate well below the 2.1 children per woman
*24:55.440- 24:57.180* :  needed to replenish the population.
*24:57.760- 25:00.940* :  And with aging societies placing pressure on public services,
*25:01.320- 25:05.100* :  experts warn of a demographic time bomb that's ticking fast.
*25:05.800- 25:06.780* :  Mark Lohan in Italy.
*25:07.900- 25:10.400* :  Two environmental protesters in their 80s
*25:10.400- 25:13.360* :  have been arrested in London after smashing a case
*25:13.360- 25:16.080* :  containing one of the world's oldest legal documents.
*25:16.100- 25:18.680* :  The women from the campaign group Just Stop Oil
*25:19.180- 25:20.920* :  targeted the Magna Carta,
*25:20.920- 25:22.960* :  which dates back to the 13th century.
*25:23.420- 25:24.480* :  Nikki Cardwell reports.
*25:26.880- 25:30.320* :  Video footage posted online shows the Reverend Sue Parfit,
*25:30.320- 25:33.700* :  whose 82 and 85-year-old Judy Bruce
*25:34.200- 25:37.000* :  attacking the glass case with a hammer and chisel.
*25:39.340- 25:41.280* :  The pair then held up a sign reading,
*25:41.740- 25:43.400* :  the government is breaking the law
*25:43.880- 25:45.740* :  before gluing themselves to the display
*25:46.320- 25:49.160* :  and calling on ministers to act on climate change.
*25:51.340- 25:55.100* :  The British Library said a security team had intervened
*25:55.400- 25:57.400* :  and the damage to the case was minimal.
*25:57.880- 26:00.320* :  The gallery for the display has been closed
*26:00.320- 26:01.600* :  until further notice.
*26:02.220- 26:03.020* :  Nikki Cardwell.
*26:03.700- 26:07.760* :  Now, this must be one of the most regularly ignored pieces of advice.
*26:08.380- 26:09.460* :  Read The Small Print.
*26:10.120- 26:12.920* :  But it's something we're invited to do ever more often these days
*26:12.920- 26:15.700* :  with so much online that asks you to confirm
*26:15.700- 26:17.620* :  that you've read all the terms and conditions.
*26:18.480- 26:21.620* :  And that applies particularly to privacy conditions on websites.
*26:21.620- 26:24.340* :  But now a tax lawyer has taken aim at these
*26:24.960- 26:26.480* :  with the help of a bottle of wine.
*26:26.480- 26:27.720* :  Rebecca Wood reports.
*26:28.760- 26:30.380* :  An online privacy policy,
*26:30.700- 26:33.700* :  often a very long, somewhat complicated document
*26:33.700- 26:35.940* :  that explains how the website you're on
*26:35.940- 26:39.140* :  collects, stores and uses your personal information.
*26:39.880- 26:42.500* :  But how many of us have actually stopped to read it
*26:42.540- 26:44.100* :  before buying that pair of trousers
*26:44.100- 26:46.360* :  or booking that long-awaited flight?
*26:47.100- 26:48.260* :  Very few, I reckon.
*26:48.740- 26:50.600* :  But you could be missing out
*26:50.940- 26:53.100* :  as proven by tax lawyer Dan Needle
*26:53.340- 26:55.040* :  who undertook a little experiment.
*26:55.800- 26:58.160* :  He wrote a clause in his privacy policy online
*26:58.600- 27:00.260* :  saying that if anyone reads this,
*27:00.580- 27:02.900* :  they'll get a free bottle of good wine.
*27:02.900- 27:06.200* :  So how long did it take for someone to spot it?
*27:06.420- 27:07.960* :  It's taken almost three months.
*27:08.520- 27:09.180* :  Longer than I thought,
*27:09.380- 27:10.800* :  because my audience is not normal.
*27:10.800- 27:13.900* :  My audience is tax nerds and lawyers,
*27:13.900- 27:16.500* :  the kind of weirdos who do actually read The Small Print.
*27:16.760- 27:19.020* :  Every company from the smallest coffee shop
*27:19.020- 27:20.820* :  to the biggest online retailer
*27:20.820- 27:23.400* :  has to have a privacy policy here in the UK.
*27:24.020- 27:25.720* :  And many businesses across the world
*27:25.720- 27:27.040* :  end up writing them too.
*27:27.580- 27:29.180* :  Dan isn't happy about it.
*27:29.200- 27:31.940* :  Facebook, Google, yeah, hit them with privacy policies
*27:32.460- 27:34.060* :  up to the line, sounds very sensible.
*27:34.540- 27:36.900* :  But everyone has to have a privacy policy,
*27:37.420- 27:40.120* :  even if you're doing nothing with anybody's data.
*27:40.820- 27:42.040* :  Why are we wasting everybody's time?
*27:42.260- 27:44.120* :  The inspiration phase little protest
*27:44.120- 27:46.520* :  came from a rather unusual source.
*27:46.520- 27:50.000* :  In the 1970s, there were people who took the Mickey
*27:50.000- 27:53.960* :  out of the Van Van Halen for being so spoiled
*27:53.980- 27:56.300* :  that they insisted that there was a bowl of M&Ms
*27:56.300- 27:59.200* :  in their green room with all the brown ones removed.
*27:59.980- 28:02.320* :  But actually this was not them being spoiled.
*28:02.320- 28:04.040* :  This was them being fiendishly clever.
*28:04.320- 28:06.420* :  They had a very complicated set
*28:06.420- 28:09.280* :  and they were fed up with the people operating the venue,
*28:09.800- 28:10.820* :  not reading the instructions.
*28:10.820- 28:12.620* :  That meant that when they got to the green room,
*28:12.720- 28:14.420* :  they would have a look at the bowl of M&Ms.
*28:14.660- 28:15.860* :  And if there was a brown one in there,
*28:16.200- 28:17.600* :  they knew their technical specifications
*28:17.600- 28:19.180* :  hadn't been read and they walked out.
*28:19.600- 28:21.880* :  Well, that just leaves one question unanswered.
*28:22.180- 28:24.980* :  Who was the diligent reader who's now sitting back
*28:25.040- 28:26.520* :  with a nice glass of vino?
*28:26.880- 28:29.280* :  Funnily enough, it was a guy who was researching
*28:29.280- 28:31.660* :  privacy policies, so he could invite his own.
*28:32.560- 28:33.780* :  So he wasn't a real man.
*28:33.980- 28:37.120* :  You'll just be in my mind if all you wish were to.
*28:38.680- 28:40.440* :  That report by Rebecca Wood.
*28:41.300- 28:44.320* :  If you've ever watched BBC News on television at the start,
*28:44.320- 28:46.960* :  you'll see a video showing new broadcasting house.
*28:46.960- 28:49.360* :  That is the BBC headquarters here in London
*28:49.880- 28:51.600* :  where we're broadcasting from right now.
*28:52.280- 28:55.540* :  But accompanying this is the dramatic BBC News theme,
*28:55.540- 28:57.720* :  which is now 25 years old.
*28:58.060- 29:00.640* :  To mark this event, the composer David Lo explained
*29:00.640- 29:02.300* :  how he created the theme.
*29:02.980- 29:06.160* :  Hi, exactly 25 years ago, I created the BBC News theme.
*29:06.760- 29:07.780* :  I did it with this sound.
*29:09.060- 29:11.540* :  This is the pip or the beep, we call it.
*29:11.880- 29:13.820* :  It's got that sense of accuracy and reliability
*29:13.820- 29:16.360* :  because it's a clock ticking one beat every second.
*29:16.960- 29:19.260* :  Then I added this, the bass line.
*29:19.960- 29:23.340* :  It gives the sense of strength and solidity and depth.
*29:23.960- 29:26.940* :  Then I added some more drums to enhance that bass drum kick
*29:28.760- 29:29.640* :  and some high-hat.
*29:30.600- 29:32.420* :  Then we wanted a big sound for the headline.
*29:32.420- 29:33.700* :  So it came up with this big drum.
*29:35.120- 29:36.860* :  And we can use that on every headline.
*29:38.780- 29:40.340* :  And then I went some chords.
*29:40.340- 29:41.240* :  It's been chords of tricky.
*29:41.240- 29:42.060* :  They've got to be neutral.
*29:42.800- 29:45.440* :  So it started minor going to major.
*29:46.200- 29:48.960* :  Is that sense of anxiety going to calm us?
*29:49.800- 29:51.780* :  And then it's the case about getting some top layers to that.
*29:53.860- 29:55.240* :  They're coming out to afraid.
*29:57.000- 29:58.240* :  And that's the BBC News theme.
*29:59.820- 30:03.120* :  The composer David Lo, you can watch his video on BBC Online.
*30:03.740- 30:06.740* :  Just type in, composer breaks down BBC News theme
*30:06.740- 30:08.300* :  on 25th anniversary.
*30:08.300- 30:10.000* :  It is, I promise you, worth a look.
*30:10.680- 30:13.320* :  And that theme used it when viral during the Covid pandemic
*30:13.320- 30:16.620* :  after Tiktok creator Rachel Leary raved to the music
*30:17.160- 30:19.260* :  in a video that was viewed millions of times
*30:19.260- 30:20.620* :  across social media.
*30:23.680- 30:24.920* :  And that's all from us for now.
*30:24.920- 30:27.320* :  But there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*30:27.320- 30:27.820* :  later.
