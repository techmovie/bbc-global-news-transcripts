*01:18.940- 01:22.340* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.460- 01:28.080* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Friday, the 17th of May, these are our main stories.
*01:28.080- 01:34.580* :  The United States has urged Israel to do more to allow humanitarian access to both southern and northern
*01:34.580- 01:39.620* :  Gaza and the European Union begins a formal investigation into allegations that Facebook and
*01:39.620- 01:46.100* :  Instagram are failing to protect the safety of children. Also in this podcast, how disinformation
*01:46.100- 01:51.180* :  is spreading about the causes and responses to the flooding in Brazil and...
*01:51.220- 01:54.760* :  Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess
*01:54.820- 01:59.280* :  that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring
*01:59.280- 02:04.960* :  into this world. America's National Football League distances itself from the player accused of
*02:04.960- 02:13.220* :  sexism and homophobia. The US State Department has urged Israel to do more to provide sustained
*02:13.220- 02:20.420* :  humanitarian access to both southern and northern Gaza. Egypt stopped allowing in supplies after
*02:20.420- 02:26.900* :  Israel seized control of the Gaza side. The UN's aid chief has warned that famine is now an
*02:26.900- 02:33.300* :  imminent risk in Gaza. Martin Griffiths said UN staff was struggling to help people displaced by
*02:33.300- 02:39.380* :  the Israeli offensive on Raffa and stocks of food were running out. A US State Department spokesman
*02:39.380- 02:44.460* :  Verdant Patel said Washington was working to make the Raffa crossing run effectively.
*02:45.160- 02:52.680* :  We are continuing to be concerned that travel and the flow of fuel of aid into Gaza by Raffa has
*02:52.680- 02:58.200* :  come to a complete halt, but we are continuing to work with the government of Egypt, with the
*02:58.200- 03:02.640* :  government of Israel to do everything we can to make sure that this gets open as soon as possible.
*03:03.080- 03:08.400* :  It's more pressure on Israel after South Africa in submissions to the International Court of Justice
*03:09.940- 03:14.460* :  described the operation in Raffa as part of an end game in which Gaza is utterly destroyed.
*03:14.460- 03:18.580* :  South Africa says Palestinian people in Gaza are being killed,
*03:18.580- 03:23.960* :  maimed, displaced, and starved. A lawyer arguing the case on behalf of South Africa,
*03:23.960- 03:30.060* :  Magsduplese, accused Israel of deliberately killing Palestinians by thoughting efforts to get
*03:30.060- 03:36.760* :  humanitarian aid into the territory. If Israel continues to deny that it's bombing and shelling
*03:36.760- 03:43.480* :  and military incursions and blocking of roads and entry points and its other military operations
*03:43.480- 03:50.080* :  in Gaza are preventing the fulfilment of the court's orders, the court needs to spell it out
*03:50.080- 03:57.120* :  explicitly for Israel and for the benefit of any other states that are still providing aid
*03:57.120- 04:01.960* :  or assistance to Israel in its campaign to eradicate Palestine.
*04:02.700- 04:08.400* :  Israel will give evidence to the court later today and has always insisted it is acting within
*04:08.400- 04:13.860* :  international law. Our reporter, Will Vernon, is in Washington and just before we came into
*04:13.860- 04:18.760* :  record this podcast, I asked him exactly what it is that the U.S. is asking for when it urges
*04:18.760- 04:24.960* :  Israel to provide more humanitarian access to Gaza. Well, Jackie, U.S officials say that more
*04:24.960- 04:30.620* :  humanitarian assistance is desperately needed in Gaza. The U.S. State Department today you heard
*04:30.620- 04:36.680* :  in the clip you played there reiterated a plea made many many times over the past few months
*04:36.680- 04:42.340* :  for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza via crossing points. I think the Americans are hoping
*04:42.340- 04:49.120* :  that their opening of a temporary peer will perhaps put some more pressure on the Israelis.
*04:49.120- 04:54.600* :  That peer was anchored to the shoreline near Gaza City today as we heard and the floating platform
*04:54.600- 05:00.200* :  a little further from the beach is already in place that will receive aid in the coming days
*05:00.200- 05:05.800* :  according to the U.S. military. No U.S. troops will be involved in unloading that aid. The job
*05:05.800- 05:11.900* :  will fall to the U.N. They're ready to start distributing supplies and that floating port will
*05:11.900- 05:19.260* :  provide between 90 and 150 trucks worth of aid per day. That is important and that will help,
*05:19.260- 05:24.920* :  of course, but it is far less than the people of Gaza need. Aid agencies say all this is nowhere
*05:24.920- 05:31.080* :  near enough and U.S. officials have said repeatedly that the best way of getting aid into Gaza
*05:31.460- 05:38.080* :  is via land crossings. President Biden has talked about this a lot. He stressed the importance of
*05:38.080- 05:44.000* :  it of allowing more aid in in phone calls with the Israelis. The flow of aid via land crossings
*05:44.320- 05:49.460* :  was one of the reasons why he made that ultimatum to the Israeli Prime Minister last month. We
*05:49.460- 05:55.200* :  remember it don't we in that tense phone call when Mr. Biden said to Mr. Nis√±ahu, you need to
*05:55.200- 06:02.640* :  take concrete steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza otherwise U.S. policy on the war
*06:02.640- 06:08.080* :  could change and it did change, didn't it? To supplies of heavy weapons, supplies from the U.S.
*06:08.420- 06:14.080* :  to Israel, those munitions that can be used in population centers such as Rafa, they've been paused
*06:14.080- 06:21.380* :  for the time being and other future supplies are under review but the State Department said today
*06:21.840- 06:27.300* :  that humanitarian conditions on the ground in Gaza continue to deteriorate. So I think officials
*06:27.300- 06:33.920* :  now will be rushing to get as much aid as in as possible right via this floating port but that's
*06:33.920- 06:39.460* :  meant to that's supposed to supplement land crossings not replace them. So I think they'll be
*06:39.460- 06:45.440* :  looking to put more pressure on the Israelis to change course on those land crossings and if they
*06:45.440- 06:51.240* :  don't I think the Biden administration will consider pausing even more weapons so we'll have to
*06:51.240- 06:56.980* :  see what happens with that in the coming days. That was Will Vernon in Washington. When the European
*06:56.980- 07:02.540* :  Union goes after big tech companies it doesn't muck about the fines can run into the billions.
*07:03.140- 07:09.340* :  Now the EU has got meta in its sites. It's opened a formal investigation into Facebook and
*07:09.340- 07:14.220* :  Instagram over allegations they aren't doing enough to keep children safe. The big numbers go
*07:14.220- 07:20.740* :  beyond fines about three billion people worldwide are active on Facebook. Our technology reporter
*07:20.740- 07:27.340* :  Shona McCallum told us more. The European Commission are concerned that it's still far too easy
*07:27.340- 07:34.620* :  for under 18's to not just actively seek out this kind of content but also accidentally stumble
*07:34.620- 07:40.680* :  across it and they look at addictive behavior as well because there's this thing known as the
*07:40.680- 07:45.380* :  rabbit hole effect which is something that they've spoken about extensively which basically is
*07:45.900- 07:51.560* :  you being shown more and more material and lead you to something else that you might like and
*07:51.560- 07:57.040* :  you know that's part of the appeal but in some cases this leads to more dangerous content and
*07:57.040- 08:02.940* :  that is harmful content which is what the legislation is trying to crack down on. So these
*08:02.940- 08:10.060* :  investigations have been launched a shot if you like fired across the boughs. What more realistically
*08:10.240- 08:17.660* :  can an organization like Meta do to ensure that these algorithms don't send vulnerable young people
*08:17.660- 08:23.960* :  down dangerous rabbit holes to ensure that there are proper age requirements and so on? Well there
*08:23.960- 08:29.900* :  are various things that they have already tried to do like age verification, stopping certain age
*08:29.900- 08:36.120* :  groups going online you know giving more parental controls. They say that they are developing tools
*08:36.120- 08:42.100* :  all the time designed to protect children taking down content clearly if something is flagged to them
*08:42.100- 08:48.080* :  lots of ways that you know if you saw something that was unsuitable on Instagram or Facebook that
*08:48.080- 08:55.480* :  you can flag and report it but clearly this industry is moving quickly and I think lots of social media
*08:55.480- 09:00.100* :  companies are grappling with that very question or what can they do? How can they prove to legislators
*09:00.140- 09:06.180* :  that they are indeed making changes? We've spoken to Meta today they say that they of course want
*09:06.180- 09:11.500* :  young people to have a safe and age-appropriate experience on their platforms and that they are
*09:11.500- 09:18.080* :  looking forward to sharing the more intimate details of the workings with the European Commission
*09:18.140- 09:23.740* :  so I suppose that may come out in the future you know what incremental or major changes they might
*09:23.740- 09:29.980* :  be making but these tools and policies are changing all the time. And if the investigators are not
*09:29.980- 09:37.900* :  satisfied Meta could be fined up to 6% of its annual global turnover we're talking about huge sums
*09:37.900- 09:44.060* :  of money here aren't we? That's absolutely right and clearly one of the big things about this
*09:44.060- 09:49.780* :  legislation is that you know these violations and the kind of impending fines if you like they are
*09:49.780- 09:56.720* :  hopeful to be enough of a threat to really spur these social media companies into action because a
*09:56.720- 10:04.360* :  lot of these social media companies met in particular for a long time has been blamed for showing
*10:04.360- 10:09.400* :  young people inappropriate content and not really doing anything other than paying the
*10:09.400- 10:15.380* :  thing which quite frankly is a drop in the ocean. So number column the US government is spending
*10:15.380- 10:21.240* :  hundreds of billions of dollars transforming the energy industry to try to compete with China
*10:21.240- 10:27.780* :  on green manufacturing. It's led to a boom in factories and a stronger economy but there are
*10:27.780- 10:33.780* :  fears it's also fueling inflation and record debt. The states of the economy will be a crucial
*10:33.780- 10:39.280* :  issue in the presidential election later this year. Our economics editor Faisal Islam reports
*10:39.280- 10:46.680* :  from the southern US state of Georgia. Here in Georgia the landscape is changing. Diggers,
*10:46.680- 10:52.480* :  levellers and concrete mixers are reshaping the southern bible belt of America as the battery
*10:52.480- 10:59.580* :  belt as the USA throws money at out competing China in manufacturing a variety of electric
*10:59.580- 11:07.360* :  cars and where some of these vehicles are going they won't need roads. So we're building an all-electric
*11:07.360- 11:14.120* :  vertical takeoff aircraft which is basically a flying car. Tosha Perkins helps run arch at aviation
*11:14.120- 11:20.500* :  which plans to open the new factory within a year. This flying car will hold four passengers plus
*11:20.500- 11:26.160* :  a pilot mass produced here and the hundreds to thousands flying cars per year we're going to be
*11:26.160- 11:33.160* :  getting up to thousands of jobs. How much support from US government and state government have you
*11:33.160- 11:39.000* :  heard? Tremendous support from the US government and federal, local and state level. Obviously
*11:39.000- 11:43.860* :  green energy is incredibly important to them but the US also wants to continue being a leader
*11:43.860- 11:48.300* :  in aviation and air of space. So those two things combined is the reason we're getting so much
*11:48.300- 11:54.360* :  support. Vehicles aren't the only thing taking off vertically here. The monthly spend on private
*11:54.360- 12:00.780* :  manufacturing construction across the US has shut up more than trebling to nearly 20 billion
*12:00.780- 12:06.800* :  dollars a month. Half of that is being spent in the south. President Biden's huge investments
*12:06.800- 12:13.020* :  of US taxpayer's money are part of the reason that the economy has more than defied expectations
*12:13.020- 12:18.480* :  of a recession. Indeed this is how Jamie Diamond the Wall Street Titan who runs JP Morgan
*12:19.180- 12:23.500* :  describes it. It's unbelievable but you know if you look at it it's basically booming it's been
*12:23.500- 12:29.180* :  booming for a while you know since since COVID kind of before there was slow growth but if you look
*12:29.180- 12:36.440* :  at the economy since then it's been booming. Back in the central square of Coventon in Georgia
*12:36.440- 12:42.320* :  tourists mingle with locals and while the economy looks strong the problem for President Biden
*12:42.920- 12:48.580* :  is it the local ice cream parlour? Hi welcome to scoops. Voters aren't feeling a boom or even a
*12:48.580- 12:53.860* :  recovery from recent price hikes. The people feel like it's gone well over the past few years?
*12:54.540- 13:02.420* :  Not at all not at all and hopefully it'll get better this coming you know election year but
*13:02.460- 13:08.140* :  let's see. How does it feel right now in terms of the US economy? It's not terrible I mean we
*13:08.140- 13:12.360* :  adjust to it cost of everything and you just kind of move on we're not going to stop living life
*13:12.360- 13:18.360* :  because things are but just work harder that's armato so most places are saying they can't find
*13:18.360- 13:22.960* :  people to work and so I'm like well if you can't find people to work then why are numbers so high
*13:22.960- 13:28.440* :  so like especially after COVID. This is the flip side of a strong economy inflation proving
*13:28.440- 13:34.200* :  more stubborn in the US and that presents a big dilemma here in Georgia's capital at the Atlanta
*13:34.200- 13:40.400* :  branch of the federal reserve which helps decide US interest rates. I expect the US economy to be
*13:40.400- 13:47.720* :  strong to continue to be strong but not quite this strong. That was Raphael Bostich the president of
*13:47.720- 13:53.980* :  the Atlanta branch of the Fed. It's expected rate cuts have been slowed perhaps even put off
*13:53.980- 14:00.360* :  till next year with consequences for borrowing rates around the world and from this quarter there
*14:00.360- 14:06.860* :  are new concerns about surging US government debts. That you're noting that more and more people
*14:06.860- 14:13.360* :  are asking whether our budgetary approach is a good thing to me that says okay now maybe we
*14:13.360- 14:18.840* :  should be having that conversation about are we undermining the confidence in the full faith
*14:18.840- 14:23.560* :  and credit of the US government because we really can't afford to do that. Across the US these
*14:23.560- 14:29.320* :  government backed green investments are leading to new inflation and debt risks but they're also
*14:29.320- 14:36.580* :  helping the economy defy expectations. It will matter for the election here in the US and for
*14:36.580- 14:43.420* :  the world economy too. ISIL Islam. There are no roads through the Darien gap the jungle which
*14:43.420- 14:49.080* :  straddles part of the border between Panama and Colombia but it's become a key highway for
*14:49.080- 14:54.440* :  desperate people hoping to make their way eventually to the United States and a better life.
*14:55.060- 14:59.740* :  Recent figures have revealed some worrying trends as Vanessa Bouchlouta reports.
*15:00.420- 15:07.200* :  The number of children those under the age of 18 who are crossing this dangerous stretch of
*15:07.200- 15:15.640* :  jungle between Panama and Colombia has surged. It is up by 40% compared to last year. What
*15:15.640- 15:22.180* :  UNICEF the United Nations Children Agency did was to count the number of children who are going
*15:22.180- 15:29.740* :  through this stretch of jungle and they found that more than 30,000 had crossed it between
*15:29.740- 15:37.640* :  January and the end of April so in those four months alone 30,000 children. Many of those children
*15:37.640- 15:45.880* :  are unaccompanied. They're on their own without a guardian without parents and you cannot overestimate
*15:45.880- 15:52.180* :  how dangerous this stretch of jungle is. There are criminal gangs who prey on migrants. There has
*15:52.180- 15:58.560* :  been a lot of sexual violence. Doctors without borders has reported that in one month alone there were
*15:58.560- 16:05.640* :  214 cases of sexual violence in that stretch of jungle and some of them were actually children.
*16:06.460- 16:13.620* :  So you can see the risks to these children who embark on this journey trying to get north
*16:13.620- 16:20.460* :  often to the United States. Vanessa Bouchlouta, it's traditional for graduation ceremonies in the U.S.
*16:20.460- 16:26.160* :  to have a guest speaker and most try to say something inspiring about the future to usher
*16:26.160- 16:32.980* :  students out into the world feeling uplifted. But a speech by a Super Bowl winning American footballer
*16:32.980- 16:39.240* :  has backfired. Harrison Butler has been accused of sexism and homophobia and a petition calling
*16:39.240- 16:45.820* :  for him to be sacked by the Kansas City Chiefs now has more than 100,000 signatures. More
*16:45.820- 16:51.720* :  from our North America correspondent, Emma Varty. Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2024.
*16:52.180- 16:56.540* :  In the 20-minute long speech, given for students graduating at a school in Kansas,
*16:57.100- 17:02.620* :  Harrison Butler, a three-time Super Bowl champion, took a swipe at Pride Month, talked about a
*17:02.620- 17:07.740* :  woman's role as a homemaker and criticized Catholic church leaders for what he said was an
*17:07.740- 17:14.080* :  erosion of Catholic values. He congratulated women for graduating, but said most were excited
*17:14.480- 17:18.940* :  about marriage and becoming a mother. I think it is you, the women, who have had the most
*17:18.940- 17:23.520* :  diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage
*17:23.780- 17:27.240* :  and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career?
*17:27.680- 17:31.280* :  Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess
*17:31.600- 17:35.760* :  that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring
*17:35.760- 17:41.200* :  into this world. The speech has gone viral online with many people responding on social media.
*17:41.540- 17:45.420* :  This is the most insane graduation speech I have ever heard of my life.
*17:45.760- 17:49.600* :  Who just really went in and told these women who have spent tens of thousands of dollars
*17:49.600- 17:53.800* :  getting their degrees, that those degrees ain't **** and if they need to just wipe up?
*17:53.900- 17:59.960* :  The idea that a woman's worth is tied to her ability to be a wife is like it's stuck in the
*17:59.960- 18:05.040* :  stone ages. The petition calling for the player to be sacked is gaining signatures at pace.
*18:05.040- 18:11.020* :  It says his remarks were sexist, homophobic and racist, and that it's unacceptable for such a
*18:11.020- 18:16.260* :  public figure to use a platform in this way. It's now reached 100,000 names.
*18:17.200- 18:22.280* :  The Kansas Chiefs NFL team, the current Super Bowl champions, hasn't commented on Harrison
*18:22.280- 18:26.620* :  Bucker's speech, but the player has previously made his Catholic beliefs well known.
*18:26.780- 18:31.960* :  The NFL's vice president has said the player gave a speech in his personal capacity

*18:36.500- 18:37.120* :  Emma Valdi.
*18:39.600- 18:44.320* :  Still to come, eight weeks after a container vessel destroyed a bridge in Baltimore,
*18:44.320- 18:48.480* :  a visit to the sailors still stranded on board the ship.
*18:48.720- 18:53.220* :  They were happy to see smiling faces that weren't asking them a million questions.

*20:09.100- 20:13.620* :  In each episode, I'll speak with the minds transforming medicine, healthcare, retail,
*20:13.620- 20:19.320* :  entertainment, personal computing, and more with the help of AI. Join me every other Tuesday
*20:19.320- 20:24.140* :  and explore the latest technology changing our world today and creating a more accessible tomorrow.
*20:24.740- 20:29.880* :  Listen to Technically Speaking and Intel podcast on the iHatRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts.
*20:36.860- 20:42.740* :  The authorities in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul say they're planning to build four of what
*20:42.740- 20:48.380* :  they call provisional cities, offering temporary accommodation to people who've been displaced by
*20:48.380- 20:55.380* :  devastating floods. Nearly 80,000 people are currently living in shelters. More than 600,000 have
*20:55.380- 21:02.000* :  left their homes since the first storms hit nearly three weeks ago. 151 people are now known to have
*21:02.000- 21:07.700* :  died. The authorities are also having to battle a wave of disinformation about the causes of the
*21:07.700- 21:14.400* :  floods and the authorities response. Leandro Prezerez from the BBC, S√£o Paulo Bureau told James
*21:14.400- 21:20.980* :  Melinda is more one of them was a conspiracy theory according to which the floods were now caused by
*21:20.980- 21:27.900* :  climate events, but rather by a secret US project that wouldn't use antennas to artificially
*21:27.900- 21:34.720* :  change the weather. Another one was about donations to help people right now. Several messages were
*21:34.720- 21:40.440* :  posted online saying that the local and the federal government were putting obstacles to the
*21:40.440- 21:47.000* :  distribution of food, clothes and medicines. Also rumours about the authorities hiding bodies,
*21:47.000- 21:53.240* :  is that right? Yes and again there is no indication that the government is hiding the bodies.
*21:53.520- 22:00.200* :  And what about in terms of the response by the army for example and rescue workers? Has there
*22:00.200- 22:06.080* :  been disinformation going around about that too? Of course because of the dimension of this crisis
*22:06.560- 22:10.860* :  people are having an impression that the government is not doing enough that the military is not
*22:10.860- 22:16.040* :  doing enough, but when you go to the ground you're going to see military, you're going to see
*22:16.040- 22:22.020* :  forces from federal and local government as well as volunteers. They are working together here
*22:22.400- 22:29.100* :  and of course there are a lot of things to do, but it's not true that the military is not working
*22:29.260- 22:35.980* :  in the region. Is it clear at all who might be behind this disinformation? And also I mean
*22:35.980- 22:42.840* :  what might be the reason for it? Well it's not clear and if there's some sort of coordination
*22:43.020- 22:49.120* :  or if it's just like a political group behind us, what specialists are saying is that most of
*22:49.120- 22:55.700* :  this disinformation has been targeting the credibility of Brazilian institutions in a very crucial
*22:55.700- 23:02.860* :  moment because the country is completely mobilized in order to deal with this crisis and it's
*23:02.860- 23:09.100* :  important to note that it's happening in a time where when Brazil, it's too highly polarized.
*23:09.640- 23:14.440* :  And is anything the authorities can do to try and control this flow of disinformation?
*23:14.440- 23:19.600* :  I mean if they said anything about it. What's going on right now is that the local and the federal
*23:19.600- 23:26.100* :  government have launched campaigns against misinformation specifically related to what's going
*23:26.100- 23:31.240* :  on here in the state of the organization so in addition to that the Brazilian federal police
*23:31.820- 23:35.880* :  has also launched a formal investigation in order to identify the people behind
*23:35.880- 23:41.840* :  this wave of misinformation that's taking place in such a crucial moment of the country.
*23:42.320- 23:51.260* :  Leandro Praserax in Brazil. On March the 26th the Dali, a massive container ship drifted into a huge
*23:51.260- 23:57.080* :  road bridge in Baltimore and brought it down killing six road workers who were on the bridge at the
*23:57.080- 24:03.140* :  time. The tragedy was reported worldwide. Well now eight weeks on it turns out that the mostly
*24:03.140- 24:10.040* :  Indian crew of the ship are still stuck there on board by the damaged bridge and not allowed to
*24:10.040- 24:17.040* :  get off but maritime unions are calling for them to be given a break on land. Barbara Shipley is a
*24:17.040- 24:22.760* :  US representative with the International Transportation Workers Federation. Evan Davis
*24:22.940- 24:29.080* :  asked her why the sailors were still aboard the Dali. The vessel has been stuck in the channel with
*24:29.640- 24:34.720* :  pieces of the bridge still laying on top so they couldn't move the vessel until they cleared
*24:34.720- 24:40.900* :  the channel of the bridge debris for safe navigation. The crew they're on board because
*24:41.180- 24:47.700* :  they know the vessel better than anyone for investigations helping people you know crash
*24:47.700- 24:52.840* :  investigators getting to certain parts of the vessel outside of that they still have to maintain
*24:52.840- 24:58.920* :  the vessel you know run the generators keeping eye on the the anchors that are out assisting with
*24:58.920- 25:04.340* :  the salvage teams. So the crew has been very busy. They've had their phones taken away from them
*25:04.340- 25:12.280* :  no I think. Yes sir yeah wasn't any standard investigation they're looking at all avenues and
*25:12.660- 25:20.180* :  FBI did take the cell phones with the promise to return them within 24 to 48 hours and they've
*25:20.180- 25:25.900* :  not been returned as of now. How long ago was that how long ago they took they took the phones on
*25:25.900- 25:32.200* :  April the 15th. They have contact with the outside presumably some contact. Yes they did yes they do
*25:32.780- 25:38.640* :  but it was just a shock you know three weeks after the accident now someone takes their cell
*25:38.640- 25:45.160* :  phones away and that immediate communication is gone the photos on the phone their families
*25:45.260- 25:51.880* :  how we feel if our phone is is lost it's a panic. So the company gave them new cell phones but
*25:51.880- 25:55.520* :  obviously yes they didn't have all the stuff that was on the old cell phone. They had nothing it's
*25:55.520- 25:59.880* :  a brand new empty cell phone. There's no way in which they can come off and just have a rest I mean
*25:59.880- 26:03.820* :  obviously someone's going to look after the ship while it is stuck there but they can't come off do
*26:03.820- 26:09.340* :  some shopping just not at this time they're working on surveying the vessel to make sure it's
*26:09.340- 26:14.600* :  seaworthy to tow it to the nearest port which is I think two miles away so it's fairly close
*26:15.480- 26:22.120* :  but once it gets alongside then we'll be petitioning our customs and border patrol asking for
*26:22.120- 26:27.420* :  shore leave. Barbara you have visited the ship what when did you visit the ship? I went out
*26:27.420- 26:32.340* :  last week of April and then the first week of May I've been on board. How are they how are they
*26:32.340- 26:36.960* :  fairing because they do spend a long time at sea sometimes so it's not like they're not used to
*26:36.960- 26:44.700* :  being on a ship. Absolutely. That is their big part of their life but how did you find them?
*26:44.920- 26:49.360* :  They were happy to see smiling faces that weren't asking them a million questions.
*26:50.540- 26:57.440* :  Where does this end and when does it end? When I really don't know our hope is that there will be
*26:58.000- 27:04.440* :  some decisions made soon on which seafarers they'd like to keep around for further questioning
*27:04.440- 27:10.100* :  or but not all crew members are going to be needed and we're hoping to get those crew members
*27:10.100- 27:18.640* :  home as soon as the DOJ says they're not needed anymore. Bombershiply. Algerian media say a man who
*27:18.640- 27:25.580* :  disappeared nearly 30 years ago has been found alive in a neighbor's cellar Omar Ben Omran was
*27:25.580- 27:33.240* :  17 when he was kidnapped his mic Thompson. In 1998 Omar Ben Omran suddenly vanished from his
*27:33.240- 27:38.980* :  home in northern Algeria. His grieving family came to assume he'd been killed in the country's civil
*27:38.980- 27:46.620* :  war then nearly 30 years later he was discovered in a small squalid cellar just 200 meters from his
*27:46.680- 27:53.280* :  home. Mr Ben Omran now 45 reportedly said he'd been unable to call for help because his
*27:53.280- 27:59.380* :  captain had cast a spell on him. He's been given medical and psychological help a 61-year-old
*27:59.380- 28:03.640* :  security guard has been arrested in connection with the kidnap. Mike Thompson.
*28:04.660- 28:09.860* :  India's most famous footballer Sunil Chetri has decided to retire from the sport.
*28:09.860- 28:15.900* :  The 39-year-old has often carried his team for a generation but he will play his final match
*28:15.900- 28:21.840* :  on June 6th. Our own Nigel Adely has commentated on games Chetri has played in and he looks
*28:21.840- 28:38.020* :  back now on his career. In a country obsessed with cricket Sunil Chetri has at times
*28:38.060- 28:44.960* :  single-handedly thrust India into the football spotlight. Only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo
*28:45.700- 28:52.520* :  have scored more international goals among active players but after 94 in 150 appearances for
*28:52.520- 28:58.500* :  his country Chetri has decided to call time on a career during which he's been a talisman for
*28:58.500- 29:04.080* :  India as the sport has endured a huge surge of interest in South Asia. Since scoring on his debut
*29:04.080- 29:11.420* :  in 2005 Chetri has led the blue tigers to a host of regional honors but has never been able to
*29:11.420- 29:17.480* :  guide his country to a world cup and during a video message on social media he admitted the
*29:17.480- 29:23.020* :  decision to retire wasn't an easy one. When the instinct came that it should be my last game
*29:23.020- 29:30.480* :  then I thought about it a lot and eventually I came to this this isn't so no will I be
*29:30.480- 29:36.040* :  sad after this of course do I feel sad sometimes every day because of this yes it took time
*29:36.040- 29:42.260* :  because the kid inside me he never wants to stop if given a chance to play for his country man never.
*29:42.920- 29:48.140* :  India's cricket captain Virat Kohli was among the first to pay tribute to Chetri and there's no
*29:48.140- 29:55.640* :  doubt his final game a will cup qualifier against Q8 next month will mark the end of an era many
*29:55.640- 30:01.980* :  fans will find it difficult to say goodbye but replacing India's football icon may prove to be
*30:02.360- 30:12.800* :  even harder Nigel Adali now fancy a trip to Singapore welcome to world class welcome to
*30:12.800- 30:18.920* :  Singapore Airlines Singapore Airlines staff are reportedly being given bonuses worth nearly
*30:18.920- 30:24.960* :  eight months salary the bumper payout comes after the airline earned record profits of nearly
*30:24.960- 30:30.940* :  two billion US dollars in the last financial year many employers give bonuses to their workers in
*30:30.940- 30:37.320* :  Singapore but rarely this much East Asia regional editor Mickey Bristol told us more yeah it's a
*30:37.320- 30:42.660* :  pretty massive bonus isn't it and I'm sure every worker across the globe would be happy to receive it
*30:42.660- 30:50.180* :  in their pay packet this is for cabin crew at Singapore Airlines also pilots so a whole range of people
*30:50.180- 30:57.260* :  they're going to get a big pay packet so why that's a good question Singapore Airlines itself hasn't
*30:57.260- 31:03.560* :  officially commented on it so we're not quite sure why but perhaps it's a reward for staff
*31:03.560- 31:08.800* :  who have just come out of a pretty tough period like all airlines they suffered during COVID
*31:09.120- 31:15.160* :  planes just didn't fly people were flying in Singapore Airlines pilots took a massive cut a lot
*31:15.160- 31:19.960* :  of the staff had to go and work in other jobs as well they had to work in hospitals or transport
*31:19.960- 31:26.720* :  hubs in Singapore and perhaps you could see this is a reward for that lean period so is Singapore
*31:26.720- 31:32.200* :  Airlines back to where it was pre pandemic they have managed to bounce back quite well I mean one
*31:32.200- 31:37.180* :  of the reasons they did that was because Singapore was quite quick to open up after COVID another
*31:37.180- 31:42.240* :  reason was that their Singapore Airlines was able to move back up to capacity so what happened
*31:42.240- 31:46.740* :  after COVID there was a lot of demand airlines couldn't feel that capacity because they'd sacked a
*31:46.740- 31:52.480* :  lot of workers Singapore Airlines didn't do that it gave them pay cuts and put them on other jobs
*31:52.520- 31:57.800* :  so it could bring them back quite quickly so that's perhaps why it's rebounded as well and decided
*31:57.800- 32:03.200* :  to give its workers this bonus is this a unique approach or is this sort of indicative of a wider
*32:03.200- 32:09.280* :  culture in the region there is a bonus culture in Singapore and other places in Southeast Asia as well
*32:09.760- 32:15.880* :  I think a survey at the end of last year found that about eight out of ten companies we're going
*32:15.880- 32:21.340* :  to give bonuses usually that's about a month salary that's the kind of order they haven't
*32:21.500- 32:26.540* :  other places like Hong Kong they regularly give bonuses as well and workers now expect them it's
*32:26.540- 32:32.940* :  called the 13 month salary so it's certainly not out of kilter but of course this is way way
*32:32.940- 32:38.360* :  beyond a normal bonus that was Mickey Bristol who also deserves an enormous bonus
*32:40.560- 32:44.820* :  and that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later
*32:45.220- 32:50.240* :  if you would like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it do please send us an email
