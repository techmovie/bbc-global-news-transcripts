*01:09.340- 01:11.660* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:11.660- 01:14.260* :  the 21st of May, these are our main stories.
*01:14.840- 01:18.560* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reacted furiously
*01:18.940- 01:22.740* :  after the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said he was seeking
*01:22.740- 01:25.480* :  his arrest for alleged crimes in the Gaza War,
*01:25.800- 01:27.520* :  alongside leaders of Hamas.
*01:28.140- 01:31.660* :  Here in the UK, an inquiry has concluded there was a chilling cover-up
*01:31.660- 01:35.900* :  of Britain's biggest health disaster in which 30,000 people were infected
*01:35.900- 01:37.740* :  with contaminated blood products.
*01:38.080- 01:41.640* :  The NHS and successive governments compounded the agony
*01:42.620- 01:44.840* :  by refusing to accept that wrong had been done.
*01:48.160- 01:50.200* :  Also in this podcast, in New Caledonia,
*01:50.200- 01:52.820* :  the airport is closed and blockades continue.
*01:53.220- 01:55.820* :  After violence spreads in the French overseas territory,
*01:55.820- 01:58.380* :  after a French law to expand voting rights.
*01:58.980- 02:01.080* :  And we'll hear what could be the sound of summer.
*02:05.460- 02:08.340* :  Condonation of the International Criminal Court from Israel
*02:08.340- 02:11.000* :  and Israel's allies has come thick and fast.
*02:11.420- 02:14.820* :  Following its prosecutor, Karim Karm's request for the arrest warrants
*02:14.820- 02:17.400* :  against the Israeli Prime Minister and the Defence Minister
*02:17.840- 02:20.200* :  over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.
*02:20.800- 02:24.900* :  As you heard in our earlier podcast, the ICC is also seeking a arrest warrants
*02:24.900- 02:28.740* :  for three Hamas leaders who are accused of being criminally responsible
*02:28.740- 02:32.280* :  for the killing of more than 1,000 civilians on the 7th of October.
*02:32.800- 02:36.340* :  Our correspondent Anna Holigen is at the Hague where the ICC sits.
*02:36.980- 02:43.660* :  I should say these allegations are devastating on both sides.
*02:44.240- 02:48.720* :  And Karim Karm says that the acts committed, he says,
*02:48.720- 02:52.700* :  by Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister and your of Golan Defence Minister,
*02:53.200- 02:57.320* :  aren't happening by accident, but by design part of a systematic,
*02:57.320- 03:01.440* :  common plan designed to starve and kill Gaza's civilian population
*03:01.880- 03:06.340* :  as a means to one eliminate Hamas to secure the return of hostages
*03:06.920- 03:11.260* :  and three collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza.
*03:12.040- 03:17.180* :  And then on the other side in terms of the allegations against the Hamas leadership,
*03:17.760- 03:24.780* :  he said that they were instrumental in instigating and planning the October 7th attacks.
*03:24.920- 03:30.360* :  And then just goes through some of the statements made by the witnesses,
*03:30.420- 03:35.700* :  by the survivors and says that now is the time he said in the statement.
*03:35.700- 03:40.520* :  He warned that those who ignored him couldn't complain later.
*03:40.520- 03:42.540* :  And he said the time is now.
*03:43.100- 03:47.940* :  The other thing to watch here is the diplomatic efforts on both sides
*03:47.940- 03:53.700* :  to try to prevent any future arrest warrants from actually being served.
*03:53.700- 03:57.240* :  And it's a very contentious issue because the ICC,
*03:57.240- 04:00.100* :  any country that is a member of the ICC,
*04:00.100- 04:05.860* :  is obliged to arrest anyone who is subject to an ICC arrest warrant.
*04:05.900- 04:09.920* :  But we expect some objections to that rule
*04:09.980- 04:13.680* :  that the coming days we will hear more from countries objecting as we have done today.
*04:14.080- 04:16.420* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*04:16.740- 04:18.700* :  reacted angrily to the court's decision.
*04:19.040- 04:22.220* :  The outrageous decision by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan
*04:22.860- 04:26.140* :  to seek arrest warrants against the democratically elected leaders of Israel
*04:26.900- 04:29.800* :  is a moral outrage of historic proportions.
*04:31.080- 04:34.920* :  It will cast an everlasting mark of shame on the international court.
*04:35.920- 04:38.260* :  The Israel is waging a just war against Hamas,
*04:38.260- 04:45.000* :  a genocidal terrorist organization that perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
*04:45.940- 04:49.400* :  The U.S. President Joe Biden echoed Mr. Netanyahu's comments
*04:49.880- 04:51.040* :  and called the move outrageous.
*04:51.700- 04:56.200* :  Both the UK and Israel have said the ICC's decision will make it more difficult
*04:56.200- 05:00.280* :  to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and safeguard the return of hostages.
*05:00.900- 05:03.680* :  Even one of Benjamin Netanyahu's most trenchant critics,
*05:03.680- 05:05.520* :  the former Prime Minister Ehud Ahmed,
*05:05.900- 05:07.540* :  disagreed with the court's decision.
*05:07.640- 05:10.200* :  He's been talking to my colleague Tim Franks.
*05:10.640- 05:13.960* :  Quite frankly, I think that we probably may have made some mistakes
*05:13.960- 05:16.180* :  during these last seven months,
*05:16.500- 05:23.960* :  but there is nothing near to what the prosecutor is suggesting.
*05:24.680- 05:28.740* :  And particularly, I think the fact that he binds together
*05:29.240- 05:33.440* :  the murder and the terrorist Iccinoir
*05:33.940- 05:37.760* :  and Hamadef, who has been responsible over the years
*05:37.760- 05:43.620* :  for unlimited number of the most terrible terrorist actions against innocent civilians,
*05:44.080- 05:46.960* :  is totally unacceptable by most Israelis,
*05:46.960- 05:49.900* :  including all those that are opposed to Netanyahu.
*05:50.340- 05:55.080* :  The prosecutor was very clear that he is not passing any judgment
*05:55.080- 06:00.340* :  on Israel's right to self-defense or about the reasons for the conflict.
*06:00.940- 06:05.260* :  It is about the way in which the war has been waged,
*06:05.260- 06:07.140* :  the way it has been prosecuted,
*06:07.140- 06:11.780* :  but it is not a judgment on Israel's right to wage the war itself.
*06:12.660- 06:18.840* :  They didn't have to wait seven months in order to prosecute Iccinoir and Hamadef,
*06:19.120- 06:24.020* :  and their process activities of Hamas were known from October 7th.
*06:24.520- 06:28.380* :  So why did they have to wait seven months in order to bind them together
*06:28.380- 06:29.880* :  with the Prime Minister of Israel?
*06:30.320- 06:35.020* :  I mean, this is something that smells not fair and not all-est.
*06:35.680- 06:38.800* :  When you heard the Defence Minister Yoav Galant,
*06:39.340- 06:43.700* :  just after October 7th, ordering a complete siege of the Gaza Strip,
*06:44.040- 06:47.080* :  there will be no electricity, no food, no fuel,
*06:47.700- 06:48.560* :  everything is closed.
*06:49.860- 06:58.520* :  Were you worried then that that might be construed as being against the laws of war?
*06:59.620- 07:03.360* :  I think the laws of war defend not to statements but to actions.
*07:04.120- 07:12.260* :  If there is a firm evidence that Israel has committed as a matter of policy in purpose,
*07:12.880- 07:15.300* :  war crimes, so crimes against humanity,
*07:15.960- 07:18.600* :  this is something that will have to be clarified,
*07:18.600- 07:21.720* :  and I'm sure that we have a very good answers for this,
*07:21.840- 07:24.120* :  because I don't think that this is the policy of Israel.
*07:24.120- 07:27.080* :  I'm not talking about possible mistakes which were committed.
*07:27.800- 07:30.880* :  The former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Ahmed with Tim Franks.
*07:31.500- 07:35.980* :  We know the request for arrest warrants from the prosecutor of the Icc is just that,
*07:35.980- 07:39.960* :  a request. Judges at the International Criminal Court will now decide
*07:39.960- 07:42.520* :  whether prosecutions will actually go ahead.
*07:42.940- 07:44.360* :  So how likely is that?
*07:44.360- 07:49.720* :  Shor Lay has been talking to Ryan Goodman, a professor of law at NYU School of Law in New York.
*07:49.720- 07:58.180* :  Extremely high to the point that one has to search for instances in which the pretrial chamber
*07:58.180- 08:04.880* :  would reject the application for an arrest warrant. I do know of one case, but even in that case,
*08:05.780- 08:09.820* :  the prosecutor then resubmitted the application and got it approved.
*08:10.860- 08:15.920* :  It's a record of something like 99%, but it's not completely out of the question,
*08:15.920- 08:19.800* :  especially with a long list of crimes like this that some of them might be taken off.
*08:20.120- 08:23.480* :  And we heard about Israel saying it will fight this diplomatically.
*08:23.480- 08:26.000* :  Is that possible given that this is a court?
*08:26.560- 08:29.140* :  It's very difficult, very, very difficult.
*08:29.140- 08:34.980* :  This really is a court of law. These are charges that are going to be reviewed by judges.
*08:36.060- 08:40.980* :  The one thing that I think is important as a matter of perspective is that it's a long drawn out
*08:40.980- 08:45.280* :  process. Can Israel say, well, this doesn't apply to us when not members of the ICC?
*08:46.660- 08:51.640* :  That argument doesn't work. The United States recently gave up that argument when it applied
*08:52.340- 08:57.220* :  to the question of Russian forces inside Ukraine, because Russia is not a party to the ICC either,
*08:57.220- 09:02.060* :  but the United States now says, of course, the ICC has jurisdiction over Russia.
*09:02.680- 09:08.780* :  The other argument is to try to argue that Palestine is not a state for the purposes of the
*09:08.780- 09:15.360* :  ICC statute that has been already decided by a pretrial chamber of the court.
*09:16.160- 09:19.540* :  But they did say, look, we can revisit this question in later proceedings.
*09:20.700- 09:26.700* :  What about how this relates to the international court of justice hearing, which is going on
*09:26.780- 09:29.140* :  at the moment, which has been brought by South Africa?
*09:30.740- 09:40.400* :  So today's application does not include the offence of genocide, and the South Africa
*09:40.400- 09:48.600* :  proceedings are a claim of genocide. There is another legal claim that the prosecutors making,
*09:48.600- 09:55.400* :  and he is saying that Israel is and has engaged in a crime against humanity, including persecution.
*09:56.800- 10:01.520* :  Now, that's different than genocide. Genocide is a very hard crime to prove, because it comes
*10:01.520- 10:06.200* :  with an additional element. The additional element is that the perpetrators have to be acting
*10:06.200- 10:10.240* :  with the specific purpose to try to destroy the group or hold them apart.
*10:10.800- 10:16.960* :  Could this affect the conduct of the war now? In particular, I suppose, the behavior of
*10:17.220- 10:23.360* :  Israel's allies? Yes. I do think that sub-governments that support Israel
*10:24.020- 10:30.160* :  will have to do a legal analysis and consider, for example, if indeed there are war crimes being
*10:30.160- 10:36.280* :  committed, then there could be legal liability and a legal prohibition on state supporting Israel
*10:36.280- 10:41.060* :  with arms, supplies, and the like. In fact, under international criminal law, there's another
*10:41.660- 10:46.740* :  element to this, which is that there's liability for aiding and abetting another in the commission
*10:46.740- 10:50.460* :  of war crimes. So I think they're going to have to look at that hard as to where they stand.
*10:50.500- 10:56.860* :  Professor Ryan Goodman, Professor of Law at NYU School of Law in New York. South Africa's
*10:56.860- 11:02.260* :  constitutional court has ruled that the former president, Jacob Zuma, is not eligible to run for
*11:02.260- 11:07.860* :  Parliament in next week's election. Mr Zuma, who is forced to quit as president in 2018,
*11:07.860- 11:14.040* :  has fallen out with governing ANC and has been campaigning instead in support of his new MK party.
*11:14.460- 11:18.700* :  From Johannesburg, here's Ansoy. The court said that as part of the constitution,
*11:18.820- 11:23.980* :  having been convicted for a sentence that was longer than 12 months, he is therefore
*11:23.980- 11:29.960* :  ineligible to run for office for at least a period of five years. However, he had argued that he
*11:29.960- 11:36.280* :  only served three months of the 15-month sentence that was handed to him in 2021 for quantum
*11:36.280- 11:42.380* :  to court, that was after he failed to appear before an inquiry into corruption allegations that he
*11:42.380- 11:46.980* :  was facing at the time during his tenure as a president. And he argued that he served this for
*11:46.980- 11:51.760* :  only three months, but the court held that he had been sentenced to a sentence that was longer
*11:51.760- 11:56.540* :  than 12 months and therefore that disqualified him. Next to Iran.
*12:00.820- 12:05.160* :  That sounds from central Tehran as crowds of people, many holding pictures of President
*12:05.160- 12:10.860* :  Ebrahim Reisi, chanting their support for Iran's Supreme Leader Itala Hamaney after the death of
*12:10.860- 12:16.260* :  the president in a helicopter crash. This was the view of one woman in Iran who wanted to remain
*12:16.740- 12:21.680* :  anonymous. I feel this collective happiness is what we deserve. After all the suffering we went
*12:21.680- 12:27.160* :  through as a nation, listening to bad news, death news, morning. When I think about how they treated
*12:27.160- 12:32.860* :  us, how they oppressed us, this news gives me hope. I hope this is the beginning of the end of
*12:32.860- 12:39.560* :  their dictatorship. Theresh Tessan, egg he is a journalist in Tehran. The mood is somehow sober.
*12:40.400- 12:47.680* :  The streets are somehow quiet. I saw two men. They were talking with each other. I just heard that
*12:47.680- 12:55.020* :  they were discussing this chopper crash. When I was walking, I saw a middle aged lady. She was
*12:55.020- 13:01.060* :  the religious one and suddenly she broke into crying. She was very sad. She was crying and then
*13:01.060- 13:08.740* :  she was saying that I worry about the country. Nobody officially or openly tries to show any
*13:08.740- 13:14.020* :  mood of happiness. Funeral riots for Abraham Raezi and the other people who died will begin
*13:14.020- 13:19.140* :  later. Five days of mourning are being held and investigation into the crash has been ordered.
*13:19.640- 13:23.760* :  And the election to find Mr. Raezi's replacement will be on June 28th.
*13:24.040- 13:27.040* :  Baranabasi from BBC Persian is following developments.
*13:27.600- 13:32.640* :  We have same pictures of people mourning for his death, including some state organized
*13:33.200- 13:38.060* :  gatherings in large squares inside of Iran where people have been holding up
*13:38.060- 13:45.340* :  President Raezi's pictures and expressing sadness for his death. But he was a very divisive
*13:45.340- 13:52.560* :  figure. He was by no means popular among the whole Iranian nation and those who were shown on
*13:52.560- 13:59.700* :  state TV are not the representatives of the majority of Iranians. So that's one group of people.
*14:00.200- 14:06.180* :  I mean, it's a hard-line Iranian regime. He was a significant part of it. There might be all
*14:06.180- 14:10.840* :  sorts of groups of people who are thinking, is this some hope for a more liberal future who
*14:10.840- 14:15.640* :  might have mixed feelings about Raezi's death? Exactly. A lot of people took to Twitter
*14:16.220- 14:21.320* :  and the sources that we took to Iran, there were not shedding any tears for the President
*14:21.320- 14:27.280* :  and some were even expressing happiness for his death because he was a hard-line figure who was
*14:27.280- 14:33.520* :  elected as President in 2021 in elections that saw the lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic
*14:33.520- 14:40.040* :  Republic and elections in Iran are not like elections in democratic countries and his presidency
*14:40.040- 14:46.560* :  was overshadowed by mass protests in 2022 that were sparked by the death in custody of
*14:46.560- 14:51.200* :  Massa Amini and their brutal crackdown that followed hundreds of people were killed.
*14:51.760- 14:58.380* :  And the people who are celebrating or expressing some degree of pleasure that Raezi has died,
*14:58.420- 15:03.520* :  are they just feeling some kind of sense of avenging what's happened in the past,
*15:03.520- 15:09.580* :  or are they hopeful that things might change in any way now, where there will be a new President?
*15:10.280- 15:12.380* :  It is very unlikely for things to change.
*15:13.880- 15:19.720* :  Abraham Raezi, although he was President, he did not have much power in terms of decision-making.
*15:19.720- 15:24.700* :  He executed and carried out the orders of the Supreme Leader. It is expressed that
*15:24.700- 15:29.840* :  that the new elections that will be held within the next 50 days again will be dominated by
*15:29.840- 15:34.740* :  hardliners and someone close to the Supreme Leader will be allowed to run and elected, especially since
*15:35.100- 15:39.680* :  the Supreme Leader is 85 years old. And it seems that he wants to make sure that those who
*15:40.060- 15:47.440* :  are holding the power and the holding the keys of to the most important parts of the establishment
*15:47.440- 15:50.480* :  are those who are the most loyal to himself.
*15:55.820- 15:57.060* :  And still to come in this podcast?
*15:57.060- 16:03.460* :  The places where we used to go to fish have now mostly become islands and there is no water.
*16:04.020- 16:07.980* :  We can't go by boat. If there is no water, there is no fish.
*16:08.200- 16:13.060* :  The Caspian Sea in Central Asia, the world's largest inland body of water, is shrinking.

*17:40.500- 17:45.160* :  those the words of one campaign are responding to the publication of the final report
*17:45.160- 17:52.020* :  of the UK's infected blood inquiry. It relates to Britain's biggest health disaster in which 30,000
*17:52.020- 17:57.360* :  people were infected with contaminated blood products between the 1970s and 90s.
*17:57.800- 18:02.500* :  The inquiry concluded there was a subtle pervasive and chilling cover-up of the infected
*18:02.500- 18:07.920* :  blood scandal. It's Chairman, while Sabrina Langstaff. The NHS and successive governments
*18:07.920- 18:13.440* :  compounded the agony by refusing to accept that wrong had been done. More than that,
*18:14.060- 18:19.480* :  the government repeatedly maintained that people received the best available treatment
*18:20.320- 18:25.920* :  and that testing of blood donations began as soon as the technology was available. And both claims
*18:26.800- 18:31.440* :  were untrue. Much of the blood came from the United States where donors were paid.
*18:31.440- 18:38.000* :  It was often collected in prisons. There have been 3,000 deaths linked to contaminated blood so far
*18:38.000- 18:43.760* :  and thousands more have debilitating conditions. And the Evans, who has hemophilia, was given
*18:43.760- 18:50.060* :  contaminated blood as a child. By the time he was 13, he had 8. We've been ghastly for generations.
*18:51.520- 18:57.660* :  This report today brings an end to that and it looks to the future as well and says that this
*18:57.660- 19:05.820* :  cannot continue, this ethos of denial and cover-up. Susan Lee found out she'd been infected with
*19:05.820- 19:11.840* :  hepatitis C when she was 14. There was no acknowledgement that these treatments were being given
*19:11.840- 19:18.940* :  that had these risks of hepatitis and HIV. And how can any parent walk into any facility now
*19:18.940- 19:22.160* :  and have confidence in the treatment that their children are given?
*19:49.400- 19:53.280* :  Our science correspondent Kate Lamble told me more about the findings of the inquiry.
*19:53.660- 19:58.700* :  This public inquiry has been more than five years looking at these 30,000 infections of HIV and
*19:58.700- 20:03.240* :  hepatitis and it found that they largely, if not entirely, could and should have been avoided.
*20:03.660- 20:07.080* :  When we're talking about this cover-up, we don't necessarily actually, the person in charge of
*20:07.080- 20:10.040* :  the inquiry said they preferred hiding the truth and they're saying that because they're not saying
*20:10.040- 20:14.660* :  this is a movie with someone in charge deciding what's seen and what's not. It's partly the passage
*20:14.660- 20:19.420* :  of time that documents were lost but it is true that they found today that some documents were
*20:19.680- 20:25.400* :  deliberately destroyed and that over time politicians have used inaccurate misleading and defensive
*20:25.400- 20:30.600* :  lines to take time over this. The blood that infected so many people, where was it from?
*20:31.140- 20:36.080* :  Yes, so it's a mix of things. So part of it is these blood products. It's clotting factors used
*20:36.080- 20:39.660* :  to treat people with blood clotting disorders like hemophilia and a lot of it was imported from
*20:39.660- 20:44.020* :  the United States and that's where it was made by pooling together plasma from tens of thousands
*20:44.060- 20:48.300* :  of people and just one infected person feeding into that pool could infect the entire batch.
*20:48.480- 20:53.620* :  In terms of what happens now, in many ways this is the end point that people have been campaigning
*20:53.620- 20:59.380* :  for decades have wanted, next we get some compensation. The British Prime Minister was pretty clear
*20:59.380- 21:04.320* :  about that. Yeah, they say that the details of that should be announced tomorrow and you talk
*21:04.320- 21:08.680* :  about time there. I think what's so interesting is the different responses because this problem isn't
*21:08.680- 21:13.500* :  unique to the UK. Other countries like Japan, France and the US, they all saw these problems
*21:13.500- 21:19.740* :  but a lot of it was settled in the 90s, 1996, 1997. It's taken this length of time for compensation
*21:19.740- 21:24.880* :  to be brought here, but then there's also the reaction to these recommendations for further change
*21:24.880- 21:29.200* :  within the UK system that's been made. A correspondent Kate Lamble with me,
*21:29.260- 21:35.360* :  the Caspian Sea in Central Asia is the world's largest inland body of water and it's shrinking
*21:35.360- 21:41.680* :  at an unprecedented speed. It's the size of Germany, it's bordered by five countries, Kazakhstan,
*21:41.680- 21:47.440* :  Russia, Iran, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. Antonio Bollingbrook Kent has been to Kazakhstan,
*21:47.440- 21:52.540* :  formerly part of the Soviet Union, to find out why the Caspian Sea is in crisis.
*21:56.000- 22:00.840* :  I'm just climbing up some wooden steps onto this old pier. The bottom few steps are missing
*22:00.840- 22:04.400* :  because well it's not really a pier anymore because it's nowhere near the sea.
*22:05.760- 22:09.940* :  As a matter, do you remember when this pier was in the sea as it should be?
*22:13.060- 22:18.620* :  Well, we were here in around 2006-2008. There had been newlyweds and other young people.
*22:19.160- 22:22.180* :  You'd see lots of people sitting here and walking along the pier.
*22:22.620- 22:27.880* :  As a Matsarsen Bayev is a well-known social media influencer from the Kazakh port city of Actao.
*22:28.380- 22:33.040* :  He posts about environmental issues, particularly what's happening to the Caspian Sea.
*22:35.320- 22:40.260* :  It was a very popular place and from here we'd stand on the railings and jump into the water.
*22:40.980- 22:47.300* :  As a Matsarsen Bayev, as a teenager, he used to stand on this pier and dive into the clear
*22:47.300- 22:52.400* :  blue waters of the Caspian Sea. From where I'm standing at the end of this old wooden pier,
*22:52.980- 22:56.960* :  it's at least 70 meters to where the waves are breaking along the shoreline.
*22:57.740- 23:01.400* :  The sea has receded that far in less than 20 years.
*23:03.300- 23:07.220* :  There are very few scientists in Kazakhstan who are studying the Caspian Sea.
*23:07.980- 23:12.400* :  One is Asel Tasmagombietova, the daughter of a former Kazakh Prime Minister
*23:12.400- 23:15.860* :  who set up the Central Asian Institute for Ecological Research.
*23:16.520- 23:20.560* :  She believes climate change is playing a major role in the shallowing of the sea,
*23:21.060- 23:24.440* :  which has fallen by around four meters since the year 2000,
*23:25.000- 23:28.200* :  plus there's the issue of the Russian rivers that feed the Caspian.
*23:29.140- 23:33.600* :  Them inflow of rivers into the Caspian Sea, especially the Volga River,
*23:34.160- 23:40.420* :  has diminished over time. Extensive dam construction on the Volga River initiated during
*23:40.420- 23:45.880* :  Soviet industrialization, also greatly reduced water flow into the sea.
*23:46.440- 23:50.580* :  She also mentions the impact of the offshore oil and gas industry on the sea bed.
*23:50.880- 23:56.140* :  The removal of large volumes of oil and natural gas from beneath the sea floor
*23:56.460- 24:01.560* :  can cause compaction of the sea bed, but eventually affecting water devs.
*24:02.020- 24:05.380* :  We put this to Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy, but they didn't respond.
*24:05.540- 24:09.820* :  We also contacted Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment,
*24:09.860- 24:12.560* :  regarding the Volga. They didn't reply either.
*24:14.120- 24:18.620* :  Dania Akimzhanov is head of the Regional Fishing Association based in Bautino,
*24:18.980- 24:23.800* :  further up the coast. He describes how the shallowing of the Caspian Sea is making things
*24:24.120- 24:25.760* :  much harder for fishermen here.
*24:28.020- 24:32.720* :  The places where we used to go to fish have now mostly become islands,
*24:32.740- 24:39.360* :  and there is no water. We can't go by boat. If there is no water, there is no fish.
*24:39.760- 24:45.480* :  Aktau relies almost entirely on desalinated water, and the more the Caspian shallows,
*24:45.480- 24:50.680* :  the more precarious this supply becomes. There are problems at Aktau port too.
*24:51.180- 24:56.440* :  Oil tankers crossing to Baku and Azerbaijan now can't be fully loaded because of falling water levels.
*24:57.320- 25:02.300* :  German and Dutch scientists predict that the Caspian Sea could fall by a further 18 meters
*25:02.300- 25:08.120* :  by the end of this century, which really worries Aselt-Hazmar Gambietava from the Central Asian
*25:08.120- 25:12.620* :  Institute for Ecological Research. I think it's a very serious problem.
*25:13.460- 25:20.240* :  It's very sad because we're losing time. I guess we have to prepare the region for these big changes.
*25:21.620- 25:26.940* :  And to hear more about the Caspian crisis, go to BBCWorldService.com-assignment
*25:27.420- 25:30.920* :  or look for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*25:31.880- 25:36.540* :  Here in the UK, the High Court has temporarily blocked the extradition to the United States
*25:36.540- 25:41.420* :  of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He's been given permission to bring a new appeal.
*25:41.980- 25:46.400* :  The US want him to stand trial for leaking military secrets, which prosecutors say,
*25:46.820- 25:51.920* :  in danger lives. He wants assurances that he'd be able to rely on the US constitutional right
*25:51.920- 25:58.160* :  to free speech as a defense. Mr Assange, who's currently in Belmarsh prison, will now prepare his
*25:58.160- 26:03.340* :  appeal argument about whether he'll be given a fair trial in the US. This from our legal correspondent
*26:03.340- 26:09.600* :  Doni Kashani. Today's decision is a legal lifeline for Julian Assange after a five-year-long fight
*26:09.600- 26:15.340* :  that began when Donald Trump's administration demanded he be put on trial over events 14 years ago.
*26:15.900- 26:21.200* :  In March, judges said US prosecutors must provide clearer assurances about how the Australian
*26:21.200- 26:27.120* :  would be treated. Mr Assange now has a guarantee from the US that he will never face the death penalty
*26:27.520- 26:32.920* :  over the WikiLeaks saga, but his lawyers say he may still be denied the right to argue in a trial
*26:33.380- 26:37.780* :  that his leaks were legitimate journalism protected by US free speech laws.
*26:37.780- 26:43.040* :  The High Court says that question must now be fully explored as a full appeal hearing.
*26:43.620- 26:50.000* :  Speaking outside court, Mr Assange's wife, Stena, urged President Biden to abandon the prosecution.
*26:50.600- 26:57.500* :  How long can this go on? The United States should read the situation and drop this case now.
*26:58.440- 27:05.780* :  Now is the moment to do it. Just abandon this shameful attack on journalists,
*27:06.620- 27:11.540* :  on the press, and the public that has been going on for 14 years.
*27:12.480- 27:16.140* :  For weeks, there's been speculation that President Biden wants to end the affair.
*27:16.540- 27:20.800* :  After he confirmed he was considering an Australian government plan relating to
*27:20.800- 27:26.760* :  dropping the prosecution, this new appeal will take months to prepare, given his administration
*27:26.800- 27:31.020* :  time to consider their options in this extraordinary legal drama.
*27:32.140- 27:36.560* :  At a military airbase in France, the interior minister and French military police
*27:36.960- 27:41.080* :  have honored the bodies of two Jean-Dame who died in the unrest in New Caledonia.
*27:46.020- 27:54.360* :  All is a week of violent protests in the French territory and the South Pacific
*27:54.360- 27:59.360* :  against a decision to reform voting laws. The French President Emmanuel Macron is meeting
*27:59.360- 28:05.080* :  his Security Council to discuss the crisis. They've already sent a thousand police reinforcements.
*28:05.080- 28:09.360* :  The main airport in New Caledonia has been closed to commercial flights.
*28:10.120- 28:13.300* :  Australia is awaiting French permission to evacuate its citizens,
*28:13.300- 28:16.280* :  as is New Zealand's Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon.
*28:40.020- 28:41.600* :  The key thing is that we are ready to go.
*28:42.080- 28:45.320* :  My colleague Bernadette Kioh asked our Europe Regional Editor Danny Abraham,
*28:45.320- 28:48.920* :  what led up to the violence? You need to have a little bit of context
*28:48.920- 28:54.820* :  of the history of New Caledonia. First of all, New Caledonia is about 1,300 kilometers
*28:54.820- 29:00.500* :  off the eastern coast of Australia, roughly equidistant between Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.
*29:00.940- 29:07.120* :  Now, it was taken by France in the mid-19th century and there have been, ever since then,
*29:07.120- 29:10.560* :  there have been problems and clashes with the Indigenous
*29:11.080- 29:15.020* :  Canack community, Indigenous Melanesian community there. Nowadays,
*29:15.020- 29:21.740* :  the Canack community makes up about 40 per cent of the population, about 300,000 people there.
*29:22.260- 29:27.600* :  And the pro-independent supporters amongst the Canack Indigenous community are very upset
*29:28.060- 29:34.280* :  about a new law in France that's been pushed through. Basically it would expand the voting rights
*29:34.280- 29:39.720* :  for people who settled in New Caledonia and had their main resonance there for at least 10 years.
*29:41.240- 29:47.780* :  Up to now, the people who voted in New Caledonia have had to live there since 1998.
*29:47.800- 29:53.100* :  That was a time where an agreement was reached on a transition towards more autonomy,
*29:53.100- 29:57.300* :  greater independence there. And it also scheduled several votes on independence.
*29:57.300- 30:02.780* :  Those were all, were two were marginally rejected and the third one didn't happen because of COVID.
*30:02.780- 30:08.380* :  So, there's a background to this of pro-independent support amongst a chunk of the population of
*30:08.380- 30:13.800* :  New Caledonia. And the island is a French territory. How big a problem is this for Emmanuel Macron?
*30:14.400- 30:18.420* :  Well, it's enough for him to have called a meeting of his National Security Council.
*30:18.900- 30:24.200* :  There's a nighttime curfew in the territory at the moment. There's also things like a ban on TikTok
*30:24.200- 30:29.740* :  because French fear that there's agitation in favour of more rioting. And obviously,
*30:29.740- 30:35.140* :  there's a wider backdrop to this. So, Emmanuel Macron is only a few weeks away from European
*30:35.140- 30:40.100* :  elections, parliamentary elections. And it's not a good look for him in terms of security and law
*30:40.100- 30:44.960* :  and order. Hi, you're a regional editor, Danny Aberhard. Now, if you're looking for the sound of
*30:44.960- 30:50.260* :  summer, one contender this year could be a drum and bass tune called The Spark. Rather than coming from
*30:50.260- 30:56.920* :  a big studio in LA, this one comes from Cork in Ireland and the artists behind it are all under 12.
*30:57.440- 30:58.560* :  Here's Isabella Joule.
*31:10.000- 31:17.000* :  It's loud, high energy and it's lit up the internet. This is The Spark, a song created by a group
*31:17.000- 31:23.820* :  of more than 30 Irish and refugee children. They're all between 9 and 12 years old and have shot
*31:23.820- 31:29.500* :  to social media fame after their wild music video was viewed more than 8 million times.
*31:30.620- 31:35.420* :  The Spark was made at Cabin Studio, which was commissioned to create an anthem for an Irish
*31:35.420- 31:42.060* :  National Youth Arts Day. A team of musicians there host a weekly rap project to teach kids about
*31:42.060- 31:47.220* :  songwriting and recording. Gary McCarthy is the studio's creative director.
*31:47.760- 31:52.940* :  It's all about capturing the kids' energy. We're really, really lucky to work with a really
*31:52.940- 31:58.700* :  talented group of kids who are just like naturally funny, they're gifted, they're great energy,
*31:58.700- 32:04.420* :  they're always up for a challenge and anytime they go on stage, they're absolutely smashing.
*32:04.760- 32:09.760* :  The Irish kids collaborated with children at a refugee centre in nearby county Claire to write
*32:09.760- 32:15.640* :  the song. Both groups met in Cork to record the track and make the music video before sharing it
*32:16.100- 32:23.480* :  and the response exceeded all expectations. We filmed the video all in one day, it started off
*32:23.480- 32:29.860* :  at the Cabin Studio and we got everyone onto the local 202 bus into the city centre, got some
*32:29.860- 32:35.420* :  shots on top of the bus. I had a feeling that a couple of thousand people might see it or something
*32:35.420- 32:41.960* :  like that that it would just go a little bit locally viral or nationally viral but I was not expecting
*32:41.960- 32:49.820* :  how crazy it went on X. Indeed US-based news sites Irish Central called it the song of the summer.
