*01:32.020- 01:35.920* :  A ballerissanderson at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 30th of May,
*01:35.920- 01:37.540* :  these are our main stories.
*01:38.120- 01:41.720* :  A court in Hong Kong has found 14 people guilty of subversion
*01:41.720- 01:45.720* :  in a huge case against pro-democracy campaigners in the territory.

*01:58.380- 02:00.080* :  Awesome, this podcast will head to Italy,
*02:00.080- 02:04.400* :  where our correspondent reports on why the country has not totally broken
*02:04.800- 02:06.260* :  from its political past.
*02:06.580- 02:08.900* :  And I'm Jillian, I'm from New Jersey, the US.
*02:09.500- 02:12.160* :  And why are you giving a tour of Harry Styles at home time?
*02:12.460- 02:16.320* :  I've been a fan of his for 14 years and I saw this job,
*02:16.320- 02:19.520* :  thought it was my dream job and I had to do it and give it a shot.
*02:20.040- 02:25.440* :  Popstar, Harry Styles, home village in England puts on its own guided tours.
*02:28.960- 02:34.420* :  We start in Hong Kong where 14 pro-democracy activists have been found guilty of subversion
*02:34.420- 02:38.580* :  back in 2021, among them two former legislators.
*02:39.320- 02:43.520* :  More than 30 defendants had already pleaded guilty and two others were acquitted.
*02:44.000- 02:49.540* :  It's a landmark case that is swept up Hong Kong's best known pro-democracy campaigners
*02:49.680- 02:52.640* :  and effectively wiped out that entire movement.
*02:52.640- 02:57.800* :  One of those acquitted Lawrence Lau gave this statement to reporters after leaving court.
*03:02.180- 03:03.880* :  I should not be the focus for today.
*03:03.880- 03:07.540* :  I hope everyone will continue caring for other friends in the case.
*03:07.580- 03:12.100* :  And if there needs to be a focus today, this judgment should be the focus.
*03:12.680- 03:16.020* :  Today is only the end of a phase and the whole proceeding is ongoing,
*03:16.020- 03:18.200* :  so I cannot say too much.
*03:18.620- 03:21.940* :  Emily Lab, the former chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong,
*03:22.280- 03:23.980* :  told us her reaction to the verdict.
*03:24.680- 03:30.820* :  It's a very, very sad day for us and many Hong Kong people are feeling very, very depressed.
*03:31.020- 03:38.100* :  But of course, the fight goes on. Hong Kong is not dead, but I think some of those people will
*03:38.320- 03:45.520* :  appeal and we certainly would want to continue to fight for one country, two systems,
*03:45.660- 03:49.060* :  the rule of law, independence of the judiciary.
*03:49.060- 03:56.520* :  Today, the verdict is a big blow and I saw many, many unhappy faces in court and outside court.
*03:57.140- 03:59.620* :  So it's a very, very dark day for Hong Kong.
*04:00.320- 04:04.380* :  Well, to get more ice book to our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton.
*04:04.920- 04:08.860* :  As we've just heard Emily Lau say, a very dark day for Hong Kong today,
*04:08.860- 04:15.780* :  but it really goes back five years or even a bit longer when the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong
*04:15.780- 04:22.700* :  was really strong. That was when you could see street demonstrations with up to two million people
*04:22.700- 04:28.240* :  in the streets calling for stronger democracy in Hong Kong. We have to remember that Hong Kong
*04:28.240- 04:33.700* :  back then was a quasi-democracy. It was part of Chinese territory, but it had its own political
*04:33.740- 04:41.000* :  systems. In 2019, there were local elections in which the pro-democracy candidates did really
*04:41.000- 04:48.840* :  well and I think that terrified Beijing. And then in 2020, Beijing imposed a national security
*04:48.840- 04:54.880* :  law on Hong Kong. We've talked about it a lot. It basically outlawed dissent, outlawed anyone
*04:54.880- 05:01.660* :  speaking out against the Hong Kong authorities or Beijing. But still pro-democracy campaigners
*05:01.900- 05:05.900* :  pushed ahead that same year. Even though the national security law was in place,
*05:05.900- 05:10.860* :  they decided to focus in on again on local elections in which they done really well in the
*05:10.860- 05:16.880* :  past. And they held some informary primary elections to choose the best candidates. They thought
*05:16.880- 05:24.220* :  would do really well in local elections, around 600,000 people voted in unofficial polls to choose
*05:24.220- 05:29.840* :  those candidates. And that's really what they've been caught up on. Just after holding those
*05:29.840- 05:36.480* :  informal polls a few months later, there were dawn raids that was in early 2021 and 47 people,
*05:36.480- 05:43.060* :  47 of the most high profile pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong were swept up in those raids.
*05:43.440- 05:49.740* :  Lawmakers, journalists, activists were all arrested. And they were accused of because they
*05:49.820- 05:55.060* :  participated in those informal primaries, the government argued that they were trying to strengthen
*05:55.060- 06:00.280* :  the opposition so much that it could treatually threaten the power of the state. And that's what they
*06:00.280- 06:05.920* :  barely been hung up in this case. That's what it revolves around. So that's why today we've seen
*06:05.920- 06:12.100* :  31 of those 47 just plead guilty. That includes people like the high profile student activist
*06:12.100- 06:19.800* :  Joshua Wong, who really led pro-democracy protests. We've seen 14 people convicted today and two
*06:20.340- 06:24.920* :  acquitted. So as Emily Laos said, a bit of a dark day for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
*06:25.640- 06:29.540* :  Celia Hatton Spain's parliament has approved a controversial
*06:29.540- 06:34.740* :  amnesty law for nationalists from the region of Catalonia. The bill presented by the government
*06:34.740- 06:39.560* :  of the socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez means legal action against separatist activities
*06:39.560- 06:45.920* :  withdrawn and it will benefit several hundred Catalan nationalists. The Madrid region, controlled by
*06:45.920- 06:50.680* :  the opposition, is likely to appeal the ruling. Speaking in parliament, the leader of the conservative
*06:50.680- 06:55.800* :  people's party Alberto Nunes Fejo described the process to push for the law as corrupt.
*06:58.700- 07:02.740* :  You have lied to the Spanish people because you promised not to do what you are doing.
*07:03.700- 07:09.380* :  You're turning the majority of Spanish people into certain class Spanish people. And yes,
*07:09.820- 07:15.280* :  this bartering you are doing here has only one name. We have said it from the start, political
*07:15.280- 07:21.820* :  corruption. I spoke to Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid. The law, as you mentioned there, lifts pending legal
*07:21.820- 07:26.820* :  action against several hundred Catalan nationalists for separatist activity. The right-wing
*07:26.820- 07:31.960* :  opposition is opposed to that law on principle. They say that it is giving preferential
*07:31.960- 07:38.160* :  treatment to Catalan by lifting this legal action like this. But they also say that it's
*07:38.160- 07:43.800* :  undemocratic. It goes against the spirit of Spain's democracy. And their other criticism is that
*07:43.800- 07:48.520* :  the only reason that the socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez presented this law in the first
*07:48.560- 07:55.700* :  place was that he needed the support in parliament of Catalan nationalist parties who asked him for
*07:55.700- 08:01.620* :  this law. So those are some of the criticisms. Mr. Sanchez, by contrast, has consistently argued
*08:01.900- 08:09.780* :  that the amnesty is aiming to calm tensions in Catalonia, which had been running so high for so
*08:09.780- 08:15.500* :  long because of efforts to break away from Spain. And he says that it's already on the way to
*08:15.500- 08:22.780* :  achieving that aim. And what would it effectively mean for Catalan nationalists? Well, it affects
*08:22.800- 08:26.760* :  different types of Catalan nationalists, if you like. I mean, a lot of the people who are going to
*08:26.760- 08:31.680* :  benefit from it were people who were involved in the 2017 independence referendum, which
*08:31.680- 08:36.860* :  deemed illegal by the central government. So for example, there might be civil servants or
*08:36.860- 08:42.920* :  head teachers of schools who allowed their schools to be used for that illegal referendum, who
*08:42.920- 08:50.140* :  have been facing legal action ever since then. That legal action has now lifted. But by contrast,
*08:50.140- 08:55.680* :  there are also many politicians who've been facing more serious charges. The most high profile
*08:55.680- 09:02.020* :  beneficiary of this law will be Carlos Pushdemon, the man who led that 2017 independence drive.
*09:02.720- 09:08.180* :  He fled the country after that independence drive, failed in 2017. He's been living abroad
*09:08.180- 09:14.520* :  for the last seven years. And it looks as if he will now return in the coming weeks because
*09:14.520- 09:21.120* :  of this amnesty. Guy Hegeco, far-right parties are expected to make big gains in the European
*09:21.120- 09:25.460* :  elections in just over a week's time. In Italy, the party of the Prime Minister,
*09:25.460- 09:31.460* :  George Melloni, is topping the polls. It is roots in post-war fascism, but is moderated in
*09:31.460- 09:38.000* :  office. As our room correspondent, Martin Lone reports, Italy allows ghosts from its past to haunt the
*09:38.000- 09:47.600* :  present. In Verona's football stadium, the fandom and the politics is hard-line. At home to
*09:47.600- 09:54.180* :  neighbouring Sassuolo, the Ultras, Italy's fanatical supporters, control one end, and they've built a
*09:54.180- 10:00.700* :  reputation. As recently as December, these fans were suspended for a couple of matches due to racist
*10:00.700- 10:09.400* :  chance. No sign of them today. An absent two are the swastika banners. But the stadium aware far-right
*10:09.400- 10:16.240* :  politics has felt freest, and where fascism has flourished. At a recent team celebration,
*10:16.240- 10:21.380* :  the leader of the Ultras roared, who paid for this evening, who gifted it to us.
*10:24.740- 10:30.200* :  Prompting the cheer, we're a fantastic team in the shape of a swastika, how great it is to be
*10:30.200- 10:36.020* :  trained by Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. My name is Roberto Führer and the National Secretary of
*10:36.260- 10:41.960* :  Forza Nuava. Italy's Ultras are often part of extremist political groups, including Forza Nuava,
*10:41.960- 10:47.680* :  a small but defiant party whose members have attacked migrants over the years. At the funeral
*10:47.680- 10:53.060* :  of a party official, a swastika flag was draped over her coffin. Are you a fascist? I probably
*10:53.060- 10:59.500* :  would say yes, but I have to complete the term and say I'm a revolutionary. This was a regime that
*10:59.500- 11:05.760* :  deported Jews to death camps, that put political opponents in internment camps. You honestly
*11:05.760- 11:10.120* :  sang that you support those measures. The internment camps are things that happened with the war.
*11:10.280- 11:13.660* :  The Americans did it, the Germans did it, the Italian did it, and so on.
*11:13.660- 11:18.260* :  In your Mussolini at rest more than half a million. It's over a century since the fascist dictator
*11:18.260- 11:24.260* :  Benito Mussolini began his two decades of totalitarian rule. After he was killed in 1945,
*11:24.260- 11:30.060* :  a neo-fascist party was allowed to form. It was sidelined until the 90s when Silvio
*11:30.060- 11:32.560* :  Bettelosconi brought it into his governing coalition.
*11:36.260- 11:40.680* :  George Melloni, Italy's current Prime Minister, started out in the neo-fascist youth.
*11:41.240- 11:45.880* :  She has moderated, moving her party away from the far right and is topping the polls before
*11:45.920- 11:50.720* :  the upcoming European elections. But her critics say she still winks at her roots.
*11:51.300- 11:55.600* :  Journalist Paolo Berizzi has been under police protection for the past five years
*11:56.060- 12:03.200* :  after neo-fascist threats. Far right and neo-fascist groups felt legitimized with the
*12:03.200- 12:08.020* :  Melloni government. She appointed ministers and even the president of the Senate who have a
*12:08.020- 12:13.980* :  political background not unrelated to fascist nostalgia. Many leaders, including Berizzconi and
*12:13.980- 12:19.820* :  Melloni, have tried to sanitize fascism and in public opinion it is no longer seen as the ugly
*12:19.820- 12:26.820* :  and evil monster. For many Italians, the fight against fascism is still central to their political
*12:26.820- 12:32.680* :  purpose. In Bologna, historically the heart of anti-fascism, a teacher shows students a memorial
*12:32.680- 12:39.140* :  to Italy's worst terror attack, bombings at the station in 1980 by neo-fascists that killed 85
*12:39.140- 12:45.620* :  people. The city's deputy mayor is Emily Clancy. We are seeing things that are very similar to
*12:45.620- 12:51.860* :  what happened at the beginning of fascism a century ago. Attacks on freedom of press, censorship,
*12:52.560- 12:59.440* :  freedom for the LGBTQI community. The far right, not only in Italy but all over the world, is sort of
*12:59.780- 13:06.640* :  trying to find escape goat for people's difficulties in everyday lives by attacking the migrant.
*13:06.760- 13:12.260* :  To me it's quite striking as being very close to fascism. It's again that same sort of tactic.
*13:12.260- 13:17.940* :  I'll make you scared of something that's different. Emily Clancy ending that report by
*13:17.940- 13:23.420* :  Martin Loen in Italy. There's confusions surrounding a claim by an notorious hacking group
*13:23.420- 13:29.520* :  that they've accessed personal details of more than half a billion people who use the US website
*13:29.520- 13:34.060* :  Ticketmaster. Shiny Hunters, who've been linked to a string of data breaches in the past,
*13:34.420- 13:39.560* :  are demanding a ransom. But Ticketmaster, which operates a massive ticket sales platform,
*13:39.560- 13:45.440* :  hasn't commented. So, what's happening? Lizzie Hawking spoke to Nigel Fair, a professor of
*13:45.440- 13:51.520* :  cyber security at Australia's Monash University. It's an interesting one. We've got the hackers saying
*13:51.520- 13:56.280* :  it's about 560 million records that they've got access to and they've gotten them for sale
*13:56.880- 14:03.360* :  for US $500,000. But on the other side of the coin we've got the organisation saying nothing.
*14:03.940- 14:09.800* :  So, we don't know how to verify that claim. I think it's interesting that the fact that the
*14:09.800- 14:13.940* :  organisation has said nothing if they had nothing to hide and you sort of sell them otherwise.
*14:14.620- 14:17.920* :  There have been a lot of people though Nigel out there who are going to be really worried
*14:17.920- 14:23.760* :  that they might have been hacked. What can they do? Oh, substantially. And it's really hard
*14:23.760- 14:29.100* :  because we use these platforms in good faith and we assume these big platforms are going to keep
*14:29.100- 14:35.880* :  our personally identifying information safe and secure. So, the relationship between the consumer
*14:35.880- 14:41.700* :  and the platform is really out of skew. So, essentially all people can really do is be hyper vigilant.
*14:42.540- 14:47.440* :  They can monitor bank statements, they can monitor unusual SMS, phone calls,
*14:48.980- 14:53.360* :  emails for any phishing attacks and just trying to be as good as they can online.
*14:53.900- 14:58.080* :  Because Nigel, is this kind of thing becoming more and more common? It feels that way,
*14:58.080- 15:03.140* :  but is that what's happening? It certainly is what's happening. We're seeing large-scale data breaches,
*15:03.360- 15:09.780* :  you know, monthly, smaller-scale data breaches weekly, if not daily. All impacting on the trust,
*15:09.780- 15:15.320* :  the safety and the confidence of internet users. Nigel Fair, a professor of cybersecurity.
*15:17.820- 15:22.140* :  Coming up in this podcast, we speak to people from small businesses in the United States
*15:22.140- 15:25.700* :  who are feeling the impact from the Baltimore Bridge collapse.
*15:26.060- 15:32.680* :  I've gone back to working a second job and man, it's hard, dude. I am like, I'm tired.
*15:36.220- 15:43.940* :  This year, 2024 is an historic election year with politicians vying for power in some 50 countries.
*15:44.760- 15:50.540* :  More than two billion voters either have already or will be heading to the polls in countries
*15:50.540- 15:56.020* :  including the United States, India, Mexico and South Africa.
*15:57.000- 16:01.780* :  And here in the UK, the general election has been called for July the 4th.

*17:36.300- 17:39.940* :  As we record this podcast and with counting very much still underway,
*17:40.440- 17:46.000* :  early projections in South Africa's general election suggest that the ruling ANC has lost its
*17:46.000- 17:51.680* :  majority in the key province of Quasulin et al to the MK opposition party led by the former
*17:51.680- 17:57.940* :  president Jacob Zuma. Slila Negobani is MK's secretary general. It shows that what we've done
*17:57.940- 18:02.500* :  we mean business. The numbers we start to trickle in and what's our expectation when we are
*18:02.600- 18:07.880* :  campaigning for two debt majority because our aim is to change this constitution of this counter
*18:07.880- 18:12.580* :  that is oppressive to our people. Our as we are driven by the mandate of the people to free
*18:12.580- 18:17.120* :  them from the oppression of the capitalist agenda where it's extrapolating economic
*18:17.120- 18:21.100* :  with the South African move it somewhere else and not benefiting the people of this country.
*18:21.740- 18:26.860* :  Projection suggests that the ANC is also likely to fall short of the vote share it needs
*18:26.860- 18:32.600* :  to remain in office without coalition partners. A correspondent Barbara Plattasha is in Johannesburg.
*18:32.880- 18:39.600* :  Around 19 voting districts have been counted so far. The ANC is leading with around 43%.
*18:39.600- 18:45.420* :  The main opposition party the Democratic Alliance has around 25%. It's the pro-business party that
*18:45.420- 18:50.580* :  has it stronghold in the Western Cape. And then there are these two other parties that are led by
*18:50.580- 18:57.560* :  former ANC figures which are left wing rivals to the ANC now. You mentioned the MK party for the
*18:57.560- 19:03.020* :  former president Jacob Zuma that's around 8% and then there is the economic freedom fighters
*19:03.500- 19:08.300* :  which advocate nationalization of minds and banks and things like that. There are around 9%.
*19:08.300- 19:15.080* :  So that's the sort of map that we have at the moment. If the ANC loses its parliamentary majority
*19:15.080- 19:20.020* :  I mean what might a coalition government look like? You know that's going to depend very much
*19:20.020- 19:26.360* :  by how much the ANC would would lose support. So if it would have been just a small amount then
*19:26.360- 19:30.420* :  it could have made a coalition with some of the smaller parties and make less concessions. But
*19:30.720- 19:34.960* :  if the projections are correct it would have to take make a coalition with one of the more
*19:35.380- 19:39.600* :  big the bigger parties which are the rivals of the ANC. So the Democratic Alliance would be one
*19:39.600- 19:44.640* :  option but they are really seen they've struggled to shake their images as the party for the
*19:45.020- 19:49.740* :  the white minority and it would be quite unlikely for the ANC to look to them for a coalition
*19:49.740- 19:55.080* :  partner. That would leave the the other two that I mentioned the economic freedom fighters and or
*19:55.880- 20:01.160* :  the MK but there would be quite a lot of intense negotiations and trade-offs in order to get
*20:01.160- 20:06.060* :  something like that to work. And it does mean a huge change for the country it doesn't it because
*20:06.060- 20:12.600* :  the ANC has been in Paris since what 1994? Yes exactly it's had an absolute majority it's been the
*20:12.600- 20:19.360* :  single dominant party for 30 years. So this would be a quite a dramatic evolution in the democracy
*20:19.360- 20:25.620* :  of South Africa to have a coalition government at the national level. Now coalition governments at
*20:25.620- 20:31.240* :  sort of lower levels provincial or municipal have not been particularly successful but certainly the
*20:31.440- 20:37.340* :  vote the voting turnout and the things people were saying strongly suggested that the South
*20:37.340- 20:42.580* :  Africans wanted a change and perhaps they feel that maybe a coalition would help them to keep
*20:42.580- 20:47.400* :  their leaders more accountable. Having said that there aren't any easy options for a coalition so
*20:47.400- 20:51.400* :  if there is going to be one it's a probably to some political volatility in the coming weeks.
*20:51.920- 20:56.340* :  Barbara Plett, in Johannesburg and final results are expected over the weekend.
*20:57.420- 21:02.220* :  A mayoral candidate in Western Mexico has been murdered at his closing campaign event
*21:02.220- 21:08.060* :  ahead of elections this weekend. Alfredo Cabrero was about to address his supporters at a final rally
*21:08.060- 21:13.160* :  when he was shot in the head prompting panic in the crowd. Here's our South America correspondent
*21:14.600- 21:19.520* :  The killing of a local candidate for mayor in Coyuca just outside Acabulco is another
*21:19.520- 21:24.160* :  reminder if anyone needed of just how bloody this election campaign has been.
*21:25.040- 21:30.580* :  Alfredo Cabrero of the opposition coalition called Strength and Heart for Mexico was greeting
*21:30.580- 21:35.980* :  supporters and about to step onto the stage to close his campaign when a gunman shot him in the back
*21:35.980- 21:40.920* :  of the head. The murder was captured on mobile phone footage which has been posted online.
*21:42.000- 21:47.360* :  In the video a series of around 15 shots can be heard and state authorities later announced
*21:47.360- 21:53.020* :  that the gunman had been shot at the scene. Mr. Cabrero's coalition condemned the killing on
*21:53.020- 21:58.280* :  social media urging the authorities to investigate the crime and apprehend those responsible.
*21:59.100- 22:04.380* :  They also blamed the ruling party Modena for as they put it not having made even the most
*22:04.420- 22:08.220* :  minimal effort to guarantee the safety of the candidates in this campaign.
*22:09.360- 22:13.960* :  The killing came on the final day of what has been the most violent election in modern history
*22:13.960- 22:19.560* :  in Mexico. Earlier the front runner for president Claudia Sheinbaum closed her campaign
*22:19.560- 22:24.260* :  in the center of Mexico City urging her supporters to make history on Sunday.
*22:25.220- 22:27.980* :  She's hoping to become Mexico's first woman president.
*22:28.060- 22:33.680* :  Miss Sheinbaum, a former mayor of Mexico City, has run on a platform of continuity with
*22:33.680- 22:39.500* :  president Andres Manuel López Obrado, those social policies. But opponents have criticised Mr.
*22:39.500- 22:43.940* :  López Obrado for failing to bring the country's dire security situation under control.
*22:44.660- 22:49.840* :  Will Grant, it's been two months since the collapse of the key bridge in Baltimore in the United
*22:49.840- 22:55.420* :  States and the deadline to unblock the port's shipping channel is imminent. The government has
*22:55.420- 22:59.720* :  given a loose promise to make it happen by the end of May but there are doubts that deadline
*22:59.720- 23:03.600* :  will be met causing more disruption to the local and global economy.
*23:04.300- 23:09.480* :  Izzy Greenfield from Business Daily has been finding out how small businesses have been affected.
*23:10.040- 23:16.180* :  The port of Baltimore is a very important port for supply chains globally with in the US obviously
*23:16.180- 23:22.740* :  but also it does have global impact as it's a major port of entry both import and export to the
*23:22.740- 23:28.340* :  United States. Chloe Demrovsky is the president and founder of Edward Insights. She's an expert in
*23:28.340- 23:33.880* :  risk, resilience and sustainability. It's not the biggest but it is a really key port for certain
*23:33.880- 23:40.820* :  types of products. Those are automotive, importantly automotive, trucking, heavy machinery because
*23:40.820- 23:45.780* :  it's what's called a roll-off roll-off on port which means that they can easily bring these
*23:46.020- 23:50.100* :  these ships right into the port and they can roll off these giant products, the automotive,
*23:50.100- 23:54.940* :  the trucking and so that's really key and not every port can accommodate that. It's also a key
*23:54.940- 24:00.040* :  strategic port for a lot of commodities so it does impact a lot of different types of products,
*24:00.040- 24:06.760* :  both finished products and commodities. I mean this port is directly responsible for 15,000 jobs
*24:06.760- 24:14.000* :  within the city of Baltimore but indirectly for 140,000 jobs. To put that in context that's 50%
*24:14.000- 24:20.820* :  of Baltimore's workforce. Jennifer Pruitt is the co-owner of TP Transportation Baltimore which
*24:20.820- 24:27.080* :  operates out of the ports. When the bridge collapsed how quickly did it impact your business?
*24:27.640- 24:34.620* :  We have about 30 drivers due to container and rail work out of the port of Baltimore and off the
*24:34.620- 24:42.040* :  rail. After the first week pretty much shut us down. We had no work after the first week coming
*24:42.040- 24:49.160* :  out of Baltimore and the next closest port for us to work out of was Norfolk, Virginia but our
*24:49.160- 24:55.680* :  drivers weren't set up to work out of Norfolk, Virginia so and then the next issue was we had no
*24:55.680- 25:02.780* :  containers going from here to Norfolk so the first part of our trip was basically for free. We
*25:02.780- 25:10.700* :  were had to go to Norfolk to get the loads and how are things now? Things are still not good.
*25:11.720- 25:16.740* :  Some freight is slowly coming out of Baltimore due to being barged in and they have made a point
*25:16.740- 25:21.300* :  to give it to us if they can give it to us so I'm hopeful in the future that our workload will
*25:21.300- 25:26.560* :  get back to where it was. Those in trucking aren't the only people affected. One of those businesses
*25:26.620- 25:39.940* :  is this one. I'm Captain Bobby Lapin from Bob Baltimore so my wife and I run Baltimore's only
*25:39.940- 25:44.860* :  exclusively private sailing charter. We are locals. We live in Baltimore. We run our business out
*25:44.860- 25:51.620* :  of Baltimore doing four or two hours sailing charters each day from South Baltimore out to the
*25:51.620- 25:56.720* :  bridge and back. That's always been our route even before the bridge collapsed to sell out to the
*25:56.720- 26:04.540* :  bridge and back. It's still just strange that the skyline has just dramatically changed.
*26:05.060- 26:09.700* :  So businesses sound 23% how is that affecting your life right now?
*26:10.180- 26:15.260* :  So it's like sad so I've gone back to working a second job. We're just running the boat on
*26:15.260- 26:19.760* :  Tuesday's Friday centers and Sundays which allows me Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to basically
*26:19.760- 26:29.880* :  work a job to raise money to run a business on the side and man it's hard dude I am like I'm tired.
*26:33.960- 26:38.720* :  US President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will pay the full cost to rebuild
*26:38.720- 26:43.860* :  the bridge and for the thousands of workers and businesses impacted temporary relief programs
*26:43.860- 26:49.040* :  have been put in place. The US Department of Housing and Community Developters authorised the
*26:49.040- 26:54.520* :  neighborhood business works program to provide $15 million in grants and no interest loans to
*26:54.520- 27:01.060* :  eligible businesses. Is he greenfield reporting? Baseball one of the most popular sports in the
*27:01.060- 27:06.920* :  United States is trying to in its words right and historic wrong because of racism and segregation
*27:06.920- 27:12.620* :  black players were banned from competing in the major leagues. That changed back in 1947
*27:12.620- 27:19.720* :  when Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and he became a legend. Robinson dashes for the play.
*27:25.540- 27:32.120* :  It's close and umpire summers calls him safe on the daring manoeuvre but Yogi Berra doesn't think so.
*27:33.420- 27:36.400* :  And the fans will never forget the side of Jackie Robinson
*27:36.460- 27:42.940* :  caring for the plate on his daring steer. Well before 1947 for nearly 30 years
*27:43.380- 27:48.740* :  African Americans played in separate leagues. Their achievements have now been recognised by including
*27:48.740- 27:55.620* :  the statistics from that era in major league baseball's official history. So why is it taken so long?
*27:55.620- 27:59.260* :  Alex Richardson asked our North America correspondent David Willis.
*27:59.720- 28:06.080* :  Change has been a long time coming hasn't it. You mentioned Jackie they're breaking the colour
*28:06.080- 28:14.980* :  barrier back in 1947 that despite the fact that it wasn't until what 22 years later that a committee
*28:14.980- 28:21.080* :  was established to determine which of the so-called Negro leagues should have their scores
*28:21.080- 28:28.760* :  incorporated into the official record and another 50 plus years before the death of an unarmed
*28:28.760- 28:33.860* :  black man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer on the streets of Minneapolis
*28:34.600- 28:41.120* :  provided the impetus for major league baseball to set up a committee made up of historians and
*28:41.460- 28:50.980* :  researchers and statisticians to survey the records of 2300 players in order to incorporate them
*28:50.980- 28:58.040* :  into the record box. It proved a painstaking and a prolonged process Alex not least because
*28:58.640- 29:04.940* :  the leagues had fewer resources back in the day their statistics weren't kept in a single place
*29:04.940- 29:10.940* :  and so the researchers had to dig through decades of newspaper archives and other sources
*29:11.460- 29:18.260* :  to dredge up the scores from nearly 30 years of games and bearing in mind that we are talking
*29:18.260- 29:26.580* :  between 60 and 80 games in a typical season as well as exhibition and all star games it was quite
*29:26.580- 29:31.080* :  an undertaking as you can imagine yeah and this means that several records have now changed
*29:31.980- 29:37.700* :  that's right the findings have overturned several records that were previously attributed to white
*29:37.700- 29:45.100* :  baseball players such as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb and Willie Mays and they've underlined the astonishing
*29:45.180- 29:52.680* :  achievements of African American players such as Josh Gibson of Pittsburgh's homestead
*29:52.680- 30:00.540* :  Greys who as a result of this re-evaluation has now replaced Ty Cobb as the holder of the record
*30:00.540- 30:08.240* :  for the highest batting average in US baseball history unlike some other African American players
*30:08.240- 30:16.040* :  Alex he never made the move to major league baseball but he now heads the record tables in several
*30:16.040- 30:22.520* :  other categories supplanting even the legendary Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees
*30:22.860- 30:29.300* :  was long hailed of course as the greatest player in baseball history in one of those categories all
*30:29.320- 30:39.420* :  that some 77 years after Josh Gibson's death David Willis and finally one of the world's biggest
*30:50.420- 30:54.800* :  artists Harry Styles of course who grew up in a tiny village in England now Holmes
*30:54.800- 31:00.120* :  Chapel has decided to organize guided walking tours including a visit to the bakery where
*31:00.120- 31:05.200* :  Harry worked as a teenager to help cope with the thousands of fans who are descending on the
*31:05.200- 31:14.200* :  area our culture reporter Nguyen Anji has had a preview Harry Styles is one of the biggest pop
*31:21.540- 31:25.460* :  stars on the planet starting in one direction before launching a successful solo career
*31:27.020- 31:33.540* :  to tell me a bit about you I work in a bakery what are you doing the bakery I like serve the cakes
*31:33.540- 31:44.840* :  in the shop okay he shot to fame on the x factor since then the village where he's from has
*31:44.840- 31:50.640* :  become a must see for fans known as Harry's due to the weather today the walk down to the
*31:50.640- 31:56.540* :  viaduct itself will be quite muddy and challenging so we have now people visiting Holmes Chapel are
*31:56.540- 32:02.360* :  being offered a new walking tool a little fun Easter egg for you to your right just there behind
*32:02.360- 32:08.880* :  those green metal gates is Harry's primary school the tour guides faced a competitive process to get
*32:08.880- 32:14.580* :  the job I'm Jillian I'm from New Jersey of the US and why are you giving a tour of Harry Styles
*32:14.580- 32:21.180* :  at home time I've been a fan of his for 14 years and I saw this job and I live in Manchester now
*32:21.180- 32:25.900* :  and I was I was just thought it was my dream job and I had to do it and give it a shot and you're
*32:25.900- 32:30.700* :  16 years old why are you giving a tool like this well I personally think that due to me being a
*32:30.700- 32:35.360* :  similar age of Harry when he first broke to fame I think me giving this tour represents how young
*32:35.360- 32:40.820* :  he really was when he took such a big step in auditioning for the expert so you hired Harry Styles
*32:40.820- 32:46.780* :  when he was just a teenager what was he like he was a really nice lad just so easy going such a
*32:46.780- 32:53.240* :  pleasure to work have working for me so nice with the customers did he turn up on time yeah he's
*32:53.240- 32:57.960* :  time keeping was fine yeah no problem at all how long have you been a fan and it's about 2010
*32:58.640- 33:05.120* :  so since my direction star said pretty much your half your life way more than half yeah never had
*33:05.480- 33:09.260* :  anyone to really go with so it's really exciting come in here and do in the tour
*33:10.160- 33:14.840* :  other stops on the tour include the Twemlo Viaduct where the singer had his first kiss
*33:15.920- 33:20.980* :  it's also where he famously wrote his name in the one direction documentary this is us
*33:22.040- 33:25.740* :  and fans have now covered Harry's wall with their own messages to him
*33:28.220- 33:33.960* :  behind it all there's an important safety message in the past fans made their way to the viaduct
*33:33.960- 33:41.140* :  using this road but locals say it's dangerous by taking visitors in another direction on a traffic
*33:41.140- 33:48.180* :  free route tour organizers hope to keep them safe back at the viaduct and I couldn't go without
*33:48.180- 33:59.160* :  leaving my own heart fan and reporter Nure Nanchi and that's it from us for now but there'll be
*33:59.160- 34:04.460* :  a new edition of the global news podcast later if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics
