*01:31.940- 01:36.360* :  I'm Chris Barrow and in the early hours of Sunday, the 4th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:36.920- 01:41.800* :  Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Carina Machado has come out of hiding and attended a mass
*01:41.800- 01:46.500* :  rally in Caracas. There's been international condemnation of an Ulshabaab Islamist
*01:46.500- 01:52.460* :  militant attack in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, which killed at least 37 people. Several Western
*01:52.460- 01:57.300* :  nations, including the United States, have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon amid rising
*01:57.300- 02:04.040* :  tension in the Middle East. Also in the podcast, a remarkable story from Romania.
*02:04.600- 02:10.780* :  The bare population is increasing daily. So if you don't do something, we will have
*02:10.780- 02:17.020* :  tens of thousands of bears in Romania. After a hiker was killed by a bear, a new law has passed,
*02:17.120- 02:20.640* :  allowing 500 of the animals to be killed over the next year and a half.
*02:25.200- 02:26.120* :  We begin in Venezuela.
*02:30.980- 02:35.560* :  That's the sound of demonstrators taking to the streets of Caracas rallying against the government.
*02:36.180- 02:40.840* :  President Nicolas Maduro says he won last week's presidential election, but the opposition leader
*02:40.840- 02:45.420* :  Maria Carina Machado came out of days of hiding to accuse him of rigging the result.
*02:45.500- 02:50.400* :  Making a surprise appearance on a truck, she held a banner reading Venezuela has won.
*02:50.400- 02:55.640* :  As Machado says, there's evidence that the opposition candidate Edmondo Gonzales won the poll.
*02:56.060- 02:57.620* :  This protestor spoke to the BBC.
*02:57.620- 03:01.600* :  There was a lot of fear to come today. There has been a lot of violent repression in the
*03:01.600- 03:07.020* :  last few days. So it is wonderful that so many people have come out. We are living in a dictatorship
*03:07.020- 03:13.680* :  that is trying to destroy Venezuela. We won an election fair and square on Sunday. We have
*03:13.680- 03:19.520* :  all the votes we could have. That has been said by as many electoral observers. We know what
*03:19.520- 03:24.800* :  happened. It is a massive. So we need to take to the streets to manifest this. We need the government
*03:24.800- 03:29.140* :  to let go of power. The sovereignty of Venezuela resides in its people since the constitution.
*03:29.140- 03:32.560* :  This is the people speaking. There is nothing more powerful than doing this.
*03:33.020- 03:37.620* :  Italy, France and other European Union nations have called on Venezuela to publish the voting
*03:37.620- 03:42.520* :  records from last weekend's poll. Our America's regional editor, Leonardo Rossa, tell me more
*03:42.520- 03:48.600* :  about the demonstration. It was quite a big rally, thousands and thousands of people in Caracas
*03:49.240- 03:54.840* :  in the same location where the opposition held the final rally before the elections last Sunday.
*03:55.460- 04:02.240* :  It was peaceful. Maria Corina Machado stressed the importers of avoiding provocation,
*04:02.240- 04:08.580* :  not engaging in violence. She said we need to protest peacefully because she says we have the
*04:08.580- 04:13.880* :  facts in our hands. We have evidence that they defraud the election. What she is taking quite a
*04:13.880- 04:20.220* :  big risk by appearing? I thought so. She had been in hiding for several days since President
*04:20.220- 04:24.600* :  Maduro said that she belonged in jail or along with a presidential candidate,
*04:24.600- 04:30.660* :  Mundo Gonzalez. It wasn't certain that she was going to appear. We have to say that this was
*04:30.660- 04:35.860* :  a movement organized for several countries. I mean, there were protests across Venezuela
*04:36.740- 04:41.360* :  in Miami, in Europe, also in Colombia, where there are many Venezuelan migrants.
*04:41.900- 04:48.260* :  So they made this statement to say, look, we're not going to give up. We want the election,
*04:48.260- 04:52.840* :  but the government is saying that the one and what she said is that the opposition is stronger
*04:52.840- 04:59.140* :  than ever. The Maduro regime, she said, has lost all credibility with electoral fraud.
*04:59.560- 05:03.420* :  And we have to continue fighting, but avoiding provocation from the government, avoiding
*05:03.420- 05:08.220* :  engaging in violence. Is that true, though, saying that the opposition is stronger than ever?
*05:08.220- 05:13.160* :  Because we're a week later now. Yes, there are protests, but it doesn't seem like there's actually
*05:13.160- 05:17.320* :  much technically that they can do to push through any kind of decision on this.
*05:17.640- 05:23.940* :  Well, I expected once the election happened in the opposition, produced what they said was
*05:23.980- 05:29.980* :  evidence of the fraud. They have registered, they have the official registered from polling stations
*05:29.980- 05:34.680* :  across Venezuela. I thought there'll be a stronger movement in favor of the opposition.
*05:34.740- 05:39.740* :  I think they must be worried. They must be fearing a repeat of what happened before with
*05:39.740- 05:45.240* :  Juan Guaid√≥ when he was declared president by the United States and nothing really ever happened.
*05:45.840- 05:50.340* :  I mean, now the differences, the opposition and independent observers say they have
*05:50.340- 05:55.600* :  evidence that they won the election, but they need support either from the United States,
*05:55.600- 06:01.020* :  from other countries, or internal from the army. They need change in Venezuela.
*06:01.020- 06:07.620* :  I find it a bit weak that they go to the streets, they protest, they say, we have won the election.
*06:08.100- 06:11.900* :  But President Maduro only asked that they were saying all the evidence is fake.
*06:12.360- 06:16.580* :  They're going to stay in power. He has another six years in office. He's been in power for
*06:16.580- 06:22.900* :  11 years. I can't see it changing now unless there's an agreement being done in the background.
*06:23.600- 06:28.400* :  It's crucial here that what Brazil, Colombian, Mexico will do because so far,
*06:28.760- 06:34.140* :  they issued a statement calling for transparency, but they haven't openly criticised the
*06:34.140- 06:39.480* :  Maduro government. Leonard, a Russia. There's been international condemnation of an Ulshebaab
*06:39.480- 06:44.840* :  Islamist militant attack in Somalia, which has killed at least 37 people and injured more than
*06:44.840- 06:50.580* :  200 in the capital. It started on Friday evening with a suicide bomber detonating a device on
*06:50.580- 06:55.680* :  a busy beach in Mogadishu before gunmen stormed the area. The police said the gunmen were killed
*06:55.680- 07:01.420* :  inside a hotel. Ulshebaab controls large parts of southern and central Somalia. The group is
*07:01.420- 07:06.780* :  affiliated to Al-Qaeda and has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years against the UN
*07:06.780- 07:10.900* :  backed government in Somalia. This witness described what he saw on the beach.
*07:13.580- 07:19.120* :  I couldn't tell, but I saw many people falling on the beach. As soon as the unexpected
*07:19.120- 07:25.080* :  explosion occurred, followed by gunfire. Some people fainted. Others were in shock. Some died
*07:25.080- 07:28.880* :  and others were injured. It was difficult to distinguish between the living and the dead
*07:29.360- 07:33.860* :  due to the continuous heavy gunfire. Those who were able to flee had already moved away.
*07:34.440- 07:39.140* :  I survived and tried to help others. My colleague, Krupa Party, spoke to the BBC's
*07:39.140- 07:44.080* :  Dorcas Wangira, who's been monitoring events from Nairobi, and she began by explaining how the
*07:44.080- 07:49.680* :  attack started. Once a suicide bomber detonated his jacket, then minutes after, five other attackers
*07:49.680- 07:54.060* :  began to shoot in discriminatory at the people who in the beach, many of them, young people,
*07:54.060- 07:59.980* :  people were just come to enjoy themselves. And security forces did respond. They managed to kill
*07:59.980- 08:05.240* :  all the attackers. One escaped on a vehicle with more explosives, but we also understand that one
*08:05.240- 08:11.280* :  soldier died and one was left critically injured. There are a number of unverified videos being
*08:11.280- 08:18.520* :  shared online of the immediate aftermath of the attack. What did I show? So most of them show a
*08:18.520- 08:25.280* :  lot of people lying on the ground, many bleeding. You can see shoes cutted and some are
*08:25.280- 08:30.160* :  put out to be dead, but you could see a lot of people also to be horrified and shocked and not
*08:30.160- 08:35.060* :  knowing how to respond. We've listened also to some witnesses speak and say how they saw
*08:35.060- 08:40.700* :  the shooter should discriminate and how people are trying to run to safety. And in the event
*08:40.700- 08:45.260* :  many were left dead. What has been the reaction so far inside the country?
*08:45.660- 08:50.640* :  Inside the country, there's a lot of horror at a shock at this. I understand that this is an
*08:50.740- 08:55.840* :  area which is supposed to be well protected. There are some analysts who are saying that this was a
*08:55.840- 09:00.760* :  massive security failure. You've seen the prime minister call this a barbarous atrocity.
*09:00.760- 09:06.720* :  The president is looking visibly angry when he called for a meeting earlier. But then we also
*09:06.720- 09:11.680* :  seen reactions coming in from EGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development here in the
*09:11.680- 09:16.900* :  Greater Horn of Africa and the United Nations condemning the attack. But it's the people who have
*09:16.900- 09:21.660* :  lost their loved ones who are now left with such difficult tragedy to bear with.
*09:22.020- 09:27.320* :  And those questions around security and the and the potential laps of security that you mentioned
*09:27.380- 09:32.040* :  are interesting in light of the fact that this lighter area has been the target of previous
*09:32.040- 09:40.240* :  attacks, including a six hour alchabab siege back in 2023. Yes, it has. But this year has also been
*09:40.240- 09:46.160* :  a bit relatively calm from what we understand. And also now having this attack now on a weekend
*09:46.560- 09:51.740* :  and also some analysts are suggesting that the government has previously said that it is winning
*09:51.740- 09:57.160* :  the war against alchabab. So alchabab in its own response carrying out an attack like this
*09:57.160- 10:03.600* :  is their signal that they're still here. Dawkes Wanggira. The US Embassy in Beirut has
*10:03.600- 10:09.060* :  urged its citizens to leave Lebanon on any available ticket amid rising tensions in the
*10:09.060- 10:14.240* :  Middle East. Iran and its regional allies promised retaliation after the assassination of the
*10:14.240- 10:19.880* :  Hamas leader Ismail Haneer in Tehran and Israel's killing of a Hezbollah commander in Beirut.
*10:20.480- 10:25.280* :  An announcer on Iranian state television said on Friday the world would witness extraordinary
*10:25.280- 10:30.180* :  scenes. The UK government has also called for British nationals in Lebanon to leave,
*10:30.640- 10:35.700* :  warning the situation could deteriorate rapidly. Sweden said it was shutting down its embassy in
*10:35.700- 10:40.940* :  Beirut amid fears of a full-blown regional conflict. Israel's on high alert and a number of
*10:40.940- 10:46.180* :  international airlines have cancelled flights to the country. The BBC's Jenny Hill is in Tel Aviv.
*10:46.600- 10:51.600* :  The US has said that it will be sending an extra squadron fighter jets to the region,
*10:51.600- 10:58.200* :  as well as warships stating that America's commitment to Israel's defence is, quote,
*10:58.780- 11:04.200* :  iron clad. Now it's not the first time we've seen such a scenario. Perhaps you'll remember that
*11:04.620- 11:11.640* :  in April, Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel. Israel was able to intercept
*11:11.640- 11:17.440* :  them, shoot them down with the help of the US and other allies. Nevertheless, it is a reminder
*11:17.500- 11:24.400* :  of just how dangerous and significant this moment is. I'm here in Tel Aviv on the beach front where
*11:24.640- 11:30.600* :  it all looks and feels very relaxed. People getting on with their daily lives, but people here are
*11:30.600- 11:37.680* :  uneasy. We know that Iran has vowed, along with its proxies, revenge for two assassinations,
*11:37.800- 11:44.940* :  that of the Hamas political leader and a senior Hezbollah commander. Everyone knows something is
*11:44.940- 11:50.320* :  likely to happen, but it's not clear what that retaliation will be, what kind of scale we'll see,
*11:50.320- 11:56.140* :  or indeed, when it might happen. So this is a country on high alert, a number of international
*11:56.140- 12:01.600* :  airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel and ministers in the Israeli Cabinet were sent home
*12:01.600- 12:07.160* :  this weekend with satellite phones for use in the event of an attack which throws out any kind
*12:07.160- 12:14.040* :  of communications network. As you know, there's urgent diplomacy going on right now to try to stop
*12:14.700- 12:20.980* :  Israel's war on Gaza, which began following the October 7th attacks from exploding into a region
*12:20.980- 12:28.540* :  wide conflict. And that's why the U.S. intervention now is not only about providing help to Israel
*12:28.540- 12:34.560* :  militarily, but also focusing on ongoing efforts to try to diffuse the tension. The Pentagon,
*12:34.560- 12:41.180* :  the spokeswoman said, that they still think escalation is not an inevitability and America urging
*12:41.180- 12:48.160* :  all parties in this to look at potential for a ceasefire. Jenny Hill, an intense and bloody civil
*12:48.160- 12:53.320* :  war, has been raging in Myanmar since a coup in 2021 that saw the toppling of
*12:53.320- 12:58.460* :  Ansansuqi's democratically elected government. It left thousands dead and displaced millions,
*12:58.460- 13:03.880* :  but now after a month of fighting between insurgents and junta troops in the key town of Lashio,
*13:04.120- 13:08.820* :  the rebels say they've gained the upper hand. The news comes as the son of the deposed leader,
*13:08.820- 13:13.800* :  Ansansuqi, says there are growing concerns about her health as she continues to remain isolated
*13:13.800- 13:19.420* :  from the outside world. My colleague Julian Wariker spoke to Kim Harris and began by asking about
*13:19.420- 13:24.980* :  his mother's imprisonment. I know that she still has ongoing health issues and dental issues,
*13:25.440- 13:30.560* :  and that she won't be receiving the treatment that she needs in prison, and the conditions are
*13:30.560- 13:38.020* :  terrible. I believe the temperature in Napidor was 50 degrees Celsius, and she's in an
*13:38.020- 13:46.700* :  unconditioned concrete cell with rats and vermin. And contact between you and her, or indeed
*13:46.700- 13:54.220* :  anyone outside and her, how is that? So far, I have received one letter from her since before
*13:54.220- 14:00.040* :  the coup, basically, and that was in response to when I sent a care package last year,
*14:00.140- 14:03.780* :  which is the first care package I'd been allowed to send. Because I know our colleagues
*14:04.260- 14:09.960* :  on the BBC Burmese service were reporting that a senior member of the Hunter met her twice in
*14:09.960- 14:14.500* :  July, went into the prison to meet her twice in July. Presumably, you don't know anything specific
*14:14.500- 14:21.280* :  about that. No, not at all. If it happened, what does that say to you about their attitude to her?
*14:21.520- 14:28.720* :  Well, they clearly still think that she is the deposed, de facto leader, and that her voices
*14:29.420- 14:34.540* :  the loudest in Burma still, even though she's not allowed to speak. And when it comes to
*14:35.180- 14:40.040* :  talking with other countries like China and India, they still want to know what she has to say.
*14:40.880- 14:46.260* :  Let me talk a little bit about the outside pressure. There is some, isn't there?
*14:46.580- 14:52.080* :  Yes, and even China are starting to have doubts about the leadership in Burma at the moment,
*14:52.160- 14:58.300* :  which hopefully will result in things changing. The countries in a worse state than it has been
*14:58.300- 15:05.720* :  in my lifetime now. And if there is a change of heart by China, how significant might that be?
*15:05.980- 15:11.240* :  That's extremely significant. China has always supported the military, but now that they're having
*15:11.240- 15:15.900* :  their doubts, I can hope that things may change, and also the ties have changed their attitude
*15:15.900- 15:21.660* :  recently as well. And the Japanese are starting to also. What's prompting that change, do you think?
*15:22.000- 15:27.340* :  I think because it's so clear that the military has no control over the situation,
*15:27.340- 15:33.640* :  and that despite the resistance forces having next to no support from the outside world,
*15:33.640- 15:40.240* :  they're still winning this fight. In the past, when certainly many people will recall the long period
*15:40.240- 15:46.720* :  the many years that your mother spent under house arrest, there was a huge international move
*15:46.860- 15:52.440* :  to try and get her out, and of course, eventually she did. There isn't the same level of that now, is there?
*15:52.900- 15:57.480* :  I think that's largely due to do with what happened during the Rohingya situation,
*15:58.020- 16:04.160* :  and the fact that the international media seemed to paint my mother as somehow colluding with
*16:04.160- 16:09.360* :  the military in what was being done to the Rohingya, whereas that wasn't the case at all.
*16:09.520- 16:14.680* :  Because on that, and I'm choosing my adjective very carefully here, she was seen, wasn't she,
*16:14.680- 16:20.460* :  as being at best indifferent to the plight of the Rohingya at the time, but you're saying that
*16:20.460- 16:24.580* :  wasn't a fair portrayal of what she was really saying? Of course, she was actually trying to do
*16:24.580- 16:32.280* :  everything she could within her limited powers as part of a parallel government to resolve the
*16:32.280- 16:38.140* :  situation in a peaceful way. The situation was far more complex than people realized, and it wasn't
*16:38.140- 16:43.440* :  just the case of Buddhists against Muslims. There were Muslims killing Muslims as well at that time.
*16:43.700- 16:47.820* :  And if she had spoken out more, what would you say the consequences for her would have been at the time?
*16:48.240- 16:53.920* :  I think the country would have probably dissolved into civil war sooner than it did if she had
*16:54.380- 17:00.200* :  spoken out using the language that people were wishing her to use. And one day you still hope,
*17:00.200- 17:06.840* :  believe, she'll be free. I do, yes. If she were, what do you then imagine?
*17:07.140- 17:13.080* :  I hope she'd be able to take a step back from leading the country, but that she'd be able to
*17:13.560- 17:16.800* :  continue to give advice, to continue to have some influence.
*17:17.760- 17:22.480* :  Kim Harris, the son of the deposed leader on San Suu Chi, talking to Julian Warraker.
*17:23.480- 17:27.580* :  The organizers of student protests across Bangladesh have called for the Prime Minister
*17:27.580- 17:33.180* :  Sheikh Hasina to resign. The protesters are demanding the end of job quotas in the civil service.
*17:33.680- 17:38.840* :  Elsa Orgney reports. Nahid Islam, one of the leaders of students against discrimination,
*17:38.840- 17:44.500* :  which started the protests, told a huge rally in the capital Daka that Sheikh Hasina and her
*17:44.500- 17:50.620* :  cabinet should resign. He also demanded she should face trial after more than 200 people were
*17:50.620- 17:56.640* :  killed in demonstrations last month, many of them shot by police. Earlier, Sheikh Hasina offered
*17:57.320- 18:01.600* :  unconditional dialogue with the student leaders, saying she wanted the violence to end,
*18:01.600- 18:07.540* :  but her gesture seems to be too little too late. Student leaders rejected her offer. They're
*18:07.540- 18:12.100* :  calling for a nationwide civil disobedience campaign, starting from Sunday.
*18:15.140- 18:20.580* :  Still to come, often the first sign of the voice being damaged is husky quality to the voice,
*18:20.780- 18:25.860* :  for singers that can sometimes also evolve a change in different parts of the vocal range.
*18:25.860- 18:30.860* :  The US rock band Aerosmith have retired from touring after more than 50 years,
*18:31.340- 18:35.760* :  after the group said their singer Stephen Tyler's voice couldn't recover from damaged vocal chords.
*18:44.040- 18:48.720* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*18:48.940- 18:53.500* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce that
*18:53.500- 18:59.100* :  be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*19:17.720- 19:23.320* :  the energy sector. Brought to you by EY and Forsyte Climate and Energy, we look at the main
*19:23.320- 19:29.020* :  considerations and hurdles the shift to a sustainable society is facing, including financing,
*19:29.100- 19:35.240* :  infrastructure, empowering consumers and security of supply. We also delve into exciting new
*19:35.240- 19:41.100* :  aspects of the energy transition like the budding hydrogen economy and the use of AI. Listen to
*19:41.100- 19:51.540* :  Talking Transitions wherever you get your podcasts. Next to the UK, the British Prime Minister
*19:51.540- 19:56.400* :  Keir Starmer has said there's no excuse for violence that's been taking place during far
*19:56.400- 20:01.400* :  right protests triggered by the killing of three young girls in a mass stabbing. He said his
*20:01.400- 20:05.460* :  government supported the police to take all necessary action to keep the streets safe.
*20:06.160- 20:10.660* :  Bricks and bottles have been thrown at police as rallies turned violent in England and Northern
*20:10.660- 20:14.820* :  Ireland on Saturday. There were clashes in cities including Leeds, Manchester,
*20:14.820- 20:19.600* :  Belfast and Nottingham. There have been numerous arrests and several police officers have been
*20:19.600- 20:24.100* :  injured. Our correspondent Dan Johnson sent this report from Liverpool in Northern England.
*20:27.100- 20:31.600* :  Across many towns and cities, the police have been stretched, fighting running battles.
*20:32.340- 20:35.140* :  There have been injuries, but mostly to police officers.
*20:38.040- 20:42.900* :  Bistroggled to maintain order in Liverpool, where two counter-demonstrations clashed near the
*20:42.900- 20:50.720* :  waterfront. Anti-fascist protesters confronted around a thousand from the far right,
*20:51.100- 20:58.220* :  chanting anti-immigrant slogans. The police are now forcing back the anti-fascist
*20:58.220- 21:02.460* :  demonstrators. They're trying to create a bit of space between the two sides.
*21:04.260- 21:10.660* :  Moses, I please describe this as serious disorder in the home secretary's promising action nationwide.
*21:10.660- 21:15.880* :  We will give the police all the backing that they need in the actions that they are taking
*21:15.880- 21:22.400* :  in response to this criminal disorder and thuggery because it has no place on Britain's streets.
*21:22.400- 21:26.740* :  That's why we're ensuring that there are additional prosecutors in place this weekend
*21:26.740- 21:32.180* :  that the courts stand ready. There are people in custody and another far right demonstration
*21:32.180- 21:37.960* :  in Manchester led to further arrests. Northern Ireland's been affected too. There were street
*21:37.960- 21:44.240* :  protests in Belfast. Dan Johnson. Donald Trump says he'd be willing to debate Kamla Harris
*21:44.240- 21:49.680* :  on the conservative US network Fox News. That proposal has been dismissed by the US Vice
*21:49.680- 21:54.800* :  President's campaign team. They've accused Mr. Trump of running scared to Fox News after he
*21:54.800- 21:59.460* :  refused to agree to allow Kamla Harris to replace Joe Biden in a debate that had already been
*21:59.460- 22:04.740* :  scheduled on ABC News on September 10th. Miss Harris has already clinched the democratic
*22:04.740- 22:10.000* :  nomination. The next question is who will be her running mate. Nomiya Ikbal looks at the runners
*22:10.300- 22:15.520* :  and riders. The president, have you spoken to Vice President Harris about her running mate?
*22:15.860- 22:19.740* :  Welcome to the leap stakes. As the selection process is informally called,
*22:19.820- 22:24.800* :  it usually takes months, but with less than 100 days until the election, time is of the essence
*22:24.800- 22:30.400* :  for Kamla Harris to decide. First up, and together we're going to help Kamla Harris beat Donald
*22:30.400- 22:36.720* :  Trump this November. Andy Beshear governs the deeply-red state of Kentucky. The 46th
*22:36.720- 22:40.160* :  Raw's popularity really took off when he dealt with two disasters in recent years.
*22:40.980- 22:46.220* :  Floods on the eastern side of Kentucky, and tornadoes on the western side. He's also back to
*22:46.220- 22:50.680* :  abortion rights, a centerpiece of Harris' campaign running hard-hitting ads in a state
*22:50.680- 22:55.160* :  where the procedure is banned. But during the midterms, most people in Kentucky rejected a measure
*22:55.160- 23:00.220* :  that would deny abortion protection, proving it's a strength for Democrats and a weakness for
*23:00.220- 23:03.900* :  Republicans. Next, we have Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro.
*23:04.400- 23:09.780* :  Thank you all. God bless you. Let us get to work. The 51-year-old has seen as the bookiest
*23:09.780- 23:14.800* :  favorite with his high approval rating, incredibly important in a swing state like Pennsylvania,
*23:14.800- 23:23.980* :  which Harris needs to win. However, his very pro-Israel stance and criticism of student
*23:23.980- 23:29.700* :  protesters may put some voters off. It is past time for the University to act,
*23:30.560- 23:36.620* :  to address this, to disband the encampment, and to restore order and safety on campus.
*23:37.340- 23:42.100* :  But a Harris and Shapiro ticket would be historic, a black South Asian woman and a Jewish man.
*23:43.100- 23:46.320* :  As Americans, we endeavor to build a better life than this generation before,
*23:46.320- 23:51.860* :  and we endeavor to be a united nation. The next contender has literally been out of the world.
*23:52.040- 23:54.740* :  Arizona Senator Mark Kelly is a former astronaut.
*23:58.180- 24:02.540* :  The six-year-old has been tested by space, combat, and personal tragedy when his wife,
*24:02.540- 24:07.540* :  a former lawmaker, Gabby Giffords, was almost killed in a shooting. The former Navy captain,
*24:07.540- 24:12.880* :  Mr Kelly, is a border-state senator and can therefore reassure voters on the big issue of immigration.
*24:13.060- 24:17.080* :  There's also the big fan favorite, but many view him as an outsider at this point.
*24:17.080- 24:21.740* :  Pete Buttigieg, the 42-year-old transport secretary is constantly going viral.
*24:21.740- 24:24.940* :  Thanks to his polite Midwest-style takedown of Donald Trump.
*24:26.900- 24:29.520* :  He kept his promise to destroy the right to choose in this country,
*24:30.100- 24:32.620* :  and he kept his promise on tax cuts for the rich.
*24:32.960- 24:35.860* :  And if you want to know what a second Trump term would be like,
*24:36.480- 24:40.480* :  I would start by looking at those rare promises that he actually managed to keep.
*24:40.800- 24:44.540* :  And with his folksy demeanor, Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz could be a good choice.
*24:44.540- 24:49.540* :  The six-year-old is seen as a real connector with the working class and rural voters.
*24:49.540- 24:53.180* :  Someone who could take on Donald Trump's VP pick, JD Vance.
*25:19.900- 25:22.900* :  My colleague Simon Jack spoke to Terry Strada,
*25:23.300- 25:27.480* :  whose husband Tom died in the World Trade Center's North Tower during the attack.
*25:28.160- 25:30.940* :  She's National Chair of the Group 9-11 Families United.
*25:31.680- 25:34.080* :  So what's her reaction to the plea deal being revoked?
*25:34.980- 25:40.220* :  I am completely shocked by hearing this news, but I'm also pleased with it.
*25:40.220- 25:45.460* :  I think it is the right thing to do, so I'm happy to see the plea deal revoked
*25:45.860- 25:47.900* :  and the death penalty back on the table.
*25:48.180- 25:50.200* :  Is that the ultimate aim that you would like to see?
*25:50.200- 25:52.760* :  You'd like to see this progress to court, have your day in court,
*25:53.060- 25:56.480* :  and have the perpetrators, as you see it, put to death?
*25:57.080- 25:59.560* :  Yes, I would like to see them face the punishment,
*25:59.560- 26:03.360* :  and it happens to be the death penalty for a military tribunal.
*26:03.780- 26:05.520* :  I think it does fit the crime.
*26:06.060- 26:09.700* :  Nearly 3,000 people were murdered on American soil that day,
*26:10.160- 26:13.660* :  and the death penalty is the punishment for that crime.
*26:14.160- 26:15.320* :  It's been a very long process.
*26:15.320- 26:19.460* :  They've been in one time about this since 2003, so 20 years,
*26:20.440- 26:23.560* :  are you not worried that the problems with some of the evidence
*26:23.560- 26:27.480* :  and the way it was extracted some of the extreme interrogation techniques?
*26:28.160- 26:30.540* :  Might mean this could rumble on for years yet,
*26:30.540- 26:32.940* :  and the case may not be made, it may collapse.
*26:33.520- 26:35.000* :  Well, I hope that's not the case.
*26:35.080- 26:37.560* :  So I mean, I hope that there's enough evidence,
*26:38.400- 26:41.320* :  whether without that particular parts of the evidence,
*26:41.380- 26:43.920* :  that we can still proceed with a trial,
*26:44.660- 26:47.640* :  and we can still hold them accountable in a courtroom
*26:48.160- 26:51.100* :  with a new Secretary of Defense involved.
*26:51.160- 26:53.360* :  Maybe we'll see things move a little quicker.
*26:54.020- 26:56.320* :  It's my hope that we will see this resolved.
*26:56.560- 26:58.560* :  Yeah, do you give the Biden administration
*26:58.560- 27:02.240* :  some credit for doing this, and do you think they bowed
*27:02.300- 27:04.580* :  to pressure both from you and from political pressure
*27:04.580- 27:05.300* :  from the Republicans?
*27:05.700- 27:08.620* :  I do think that the pressure from the families
*27:09.280- 27:12.740* :  and the American public, and possibly internationally,
*27:12.740- 27:15.160* :  people could have been complaining about this.
*27:15.220- 27:19.860* :  You know, the UK lost the second largest amount of people were killed that day.
*27:20.540- 27:23.680* :  So to hear our voices and the media, you know,
*27:23.940- 27:26.780* :  amplified our voices, and they heard us.
*27:26.780- 27:31.960* :  So I'm pleased with that, and we'll just now have to wait and see what happens.
*27:32.460- 27:36.700* :  How has it been living with this situation ongoing for 20 years?
*27:36.700- 27:37.900* :  What has that meant to you?
*27:37.900- 27:42.400* :  It's terrible to live with, you know, unresolved murder case,
*27:43.120- 27:45.840* :  you know, part of your life because these are
*27:46.540- 27:47.940* :  chapters that aren't closed.
*27:48.380- 27:51.980* :  You know, we have open wounds from having this terrible attack
*27:51.980- 27:55.220* :  happened to our country, and we'd like to close
*27:55.220- 27:56.500* :  some of these chapters.
*27:57.580- 27:58.340* :  Terry Strada.
*27:59.120- 28:02.620* :  Last month in Romania, a young woman was killed by a bear
*28:02.620- 28:04.820* :  while hiking in the Carpathian mountains.
*28:05.240- 28:07.540* :  As a result, Parliament passed an emergency law
*28:07.540- 28:11.780* :  paving the way for up to 500 bears to be shot over the next 18 months.
*28:12.460- 28:15.760* :  The European Commission and numerous wildlife groups have protested
*28:15.940- 28:17.020* :  against the new legislation.
*28:17.600- 28:19.200* :  Our correspondent Nick Thorpe reports.
*28:21.020- 28:24.080* :  I'm standing beside a stream in the forest at the foot of the
*28:24.640- 28:26.800* :  Bouchegi mountains in the southern Carpathians,
*28:26.940- 28:29.980* :  just above me on the footpath, leading up through a steep gorge.
*28:30.500- 28:34.320* :  A 19-year-old Romanian woman was walking with her boyfriend in early July,
*28:35.160- 28:36.460* :  where they encountered a bear.
*28:37.180- 28:38.280* :  The woman tried to run away,
*28:38.780- 28:39.920* :  surgery, fresh an oil,
*28:40.220- 28:42.080* :  of the Romanian mountain rescue organisation,
*28:42.080- 28:46.400* :  Salvo Mont arrived on the scene with his team to try to help her.
*28:46.760- 28:48.700* :  As they approached, they'd seen the bear,
*28:49.320- 28:53.180* :  and the bear was consuming the body of the victim.
*28:53.860- 28:56.140* :  The bear was actually eating the victim.
*28:56.520- 29:00.140* :  Yeah, when they tried to get closer to the victim,
*29:00.140- 29:02.320* :  the bear began attacking them.
*29:02.820- 29:05.560* :  They was bear sprayed, they were screaming very loud,
*29:06.080- 29:07.140* :  and they were talking rocks.
*29:08.040- 29:10.020* :  A forester arrived and shot the bear,
*29:10.560- 29:14.040* :  but why was the bear coming down the narrow path towards the town?
*29:14.740- 29:16.780* :  I didn't have to go far to find the answer.
*29:17.740- 29:20.020* :  There are three big municipal waste bins here,
*29:20.320- 29:22.220* :  and what remains of a sort of cage structure
*29:22.560- 29:24.180* :  that was supposed to protect one of them.
*29:24.680- 29:26.320* :  But that bin has been tipped over,
*29:26.620- 29:28.200* :  and there's food waste everywhere.
*29:30.160- 29:31.560* :  Bear sightings and alarms
*29:31.560- 29:34.160* :  are almost everyday occurrences in this town.
*29:34.600- 29:36.460* :  This one happened the evening I was there.
*29:38.780- 29:40.300* :  In this residential street,
*29:40.660- 29:43.820* :  I witnessed a confrontation between locals and the police,
*29:44.300- 29:46.460* :  who complained the police should do more
*29:46.780- 29:48.060* :  to protect them from bears.
*29:49.760- 29:52.680* :  Barnett Ansosh, a former Environment Minister,
*29:53.000- 29:55.460* :  has campaigned for years for a return to hunting.
*29:55.900- 29:58.900* :  The bear population is increasing daily,
*29:58.900- 30:01.160* :  so if we don't do something,
*30:01.160- 30:04.980* :  we will have tens of thousands of bears in Romania.
*30:04.980- 30:08.200* :  Christy Remuspop, head of the Large Carnivore program
*30:08.200- 30:12.060* :  at WWF Romania, says the new law misses the point
*30:12.060- 30:14.100* :  and may just make matters worse.
*30:14.520- 30:17.620* :  We should aim the root causes of the conflict,
*30:18.280- 30:19.820* :  starting with feeding of the bears,
*30:19.880- 30:23.340* :  which is happening massively close to the settlements.
*30:23.340- 30:27.320* :  Another thing is that waste management is not properly
*30:27.600- 30:28.880* :  dealt with in many communities.
*30:28.880- 30:30.600* :  This is again attracting bears.
*30:31.000- 30:32.760* :  It's mostly female and young bears
*30:32.760- 30:34.780* :  that raid bins in towns and villages.
*30:35.520- 30:38.200* :  But the hunters will go after the large male bears,
*30:38.520- 30:40.500* :  high in the mountains, the trophy bears,
*30:40.960- 30:41.880* :  which do no harm.
*30:42.400- 30:43.720* :  But in one town in Romania,
*30:44.120- 30:45.820* :  they think they're close to a solution.
*30:46.840- 30:50.220* :  The small town of Bile Tushnut is famous for its bears.
*30:50.720- 30:51.600* :  In the last two years,
*30:51.960- 30:55.720* :  it's installed 14 new stainless steel bear-proof bins.
*30:56.420- 30:57.740* :  Jolt Budka is the mayor.
*31:00.040- 31:04.400* :  In 2023, we had 220 calls to the emergency number.
*31:04.840- 31:07.040* :  There was a chaos of bears on the street.
*31:07.700- 31:09.920* :  That's down to just three calls this year,
*31:10.440- 31:12.580* :  thanks to the bins cutting down fruit trees,
*31:12.980- 31:14.360* :  installing electric fences,
*31:15.000- 31:16.300* :  and a public awareness campaign.
*31:17.100- 31:20.160* :  Jolt Budka there ending that report by Nick Thorpe in Romania.
*31:21.020- 31:21.940* :  Well now for some music.
*31:27.920- 31:32.080* :  The sounds of Erasmith live from Florida in April 2004.
*31:32.140- 31:36.320* :  But the US rock band have announced their immediate retirement from touring,
*31:36.320- 31:39.020* :  due to their singer, 76-year-old Stephen Tyler,
*31:39.480- 31:40.720* :  suffering a vocal injury.
*31:41.240- 31:45.040* :  They've now cancelled all remaining dates of their peace out farewell tour.
*31:45.760- 31:47.740* :  In a statement addressed to fans on Instagram,
*31:47.740- 31:52.820* :  the band said it was 1970 when a spark of inspiration became Erasmith.
*31:53.380- 31:56.220* :  Thanks to you, our Blue Army, that spark caught flame
*31:56.220- 31:58.400* :  and has been burning for over five decades.
*31:59.040- 32:00.720* :  Some of you have been with us since the beginning,
*32:00.720- 32:03.720* :  and all of you are the reason we made rock and roll history.
*32:04.500- 32:07.380* :  So what are the first signs that show that a voice is damaged?
*32:07.380- 32:10.540* :  My colleague, Crouper Padi, asked Dr. Declan Castello,
*32:10.900- 32:14.180* :  known as a voice doctor or laryngeologist, who's a singer himself.
*32:14.980- 32:19.460* :  Often the first sign of the voice being damaged is husky quality to the voice.
*32:19.680- 32:24.720* :  For singers, that can sometimes also involve a change in different parts of the vocal range,
*32:24.720- 32:29.780* :  sometimes the upper registers, the highest notes stop working quite so well.
*32:29.860- 32:34.340* :  In the case of Stephen Tyler, what do you think damaged his larynx permanently?
*32:34.660- 32:39.680* :  Well, it seems that he had a vocal chord hemorrhage in which a blood vessel on the surface
*32:39.680- 32:43.780* :  of the vocal chord burst and caused a bruise into the vocal chord.
*32:43.780- 32:45.680* :  And I think that happened several months ago.
*32:45.960- 32:49.620* :  And that can be quite a difficult vocal injury to recover from,
*32:49.680- 32:51.760* :  because as the bruise then heals,
*32:51.760- 32:54.940* :  you hope that the vocal chord doesn't become scarred.
*32:55.180- 32:58.360* :  I'm not sure exactly how things have progressed in his case,
*32:58.360- 33:01.400* :  but it may be that he's developed scar on the vocal chord
*33:01.540- 33:03.680* :  that's just made it impossible for him to carry on.
*33:03.840- 33:08.400* :  So does that scar then create a scar tissue that almost causes a blockage?
*33:08.600- 33:09.960* :  It does create scar tissue.
*33:10.020- 33:13.880* :  I mean, the vocal chords are two tiny little bits of tissue
*33:13.880- 33:17.760* :  that sit in the middle of the neck, and they need to be very supple and pliable
*33:17.760- 33:21.960* :  to vibrate thousands of times an hour to produce clear sound.
*33:21.960- 33:26.220* :  And if there is scar then they lose their pliability, they lose their suppleness.
*33:26.820- 33:28.380* :  And that can mean that the voice changes.
*33:28.640- 33:33.940* :  Undoing scar from a surgical point of view, trying to reverse scar is really very, very difficult.
*33:34.480- 33:36.360* :  I wonder does age play a factor?
*33:36.360- 33:39.700* :  Stephen Tyler is an impressive 76 and still on stage.
*33:40.040- 33:43.460* :  I think it's fair to say that with advancing years
*33:43.460- 33:46.680* :  our healing capacity always diminishes.
*33:46.980- 33:49.200* :  That may very well be affected with him as well.
*33:49.200- 33:53.220* :  And of course it's not just about the vocal chords and their ability to produce sound
*33:53.220- 33:56.200* :  as you get older, respiratory capacity decreases
*33:56.820- 34:00.380* :  and your general muscle strength and tone decreases as well.
*34:00.380- 34:02.200* :  So in any other circumstances,
*34:02.260- 34:05.820* :  it's very common for the voice to change over the advancing years.
*34:06.120- 34:10.080* :  Ordinarily, what kind of treatment would you offer for cases like this?
*34:10.360- 34:13.540* :  Well, in a vocal chord hemorrhage, if there's been a bleed into the vocal chord,
*34:13.540- 34:17.920* :  then usually what we would say is to completely rest the voice for a period of a couple of weeks
*34:17.920- 34:23.720* :  and just let the vocal chord hemorrhage, the blood resolve and see how things go.
*34:24.100- 34:27.920* :  Sometimes then if there's a prominent blood vessel that has obviously ruptured,
*34:28.260- 34:30.300* :  you can use a laser to get rid of that.
*34:30.300- 34:34.820* :  There are lots of other different potential causes of vocal chord problems and pathology,
*34:34.820- 34:38.000* :  but in a bleed, then you really want to get to the source,
*34:38.000- 34:41.140* :  the blood vessel that has popped and caused that hemorrhage.
*34:41.220- 34:42.520* :  I understand you're a high tenner.
*34:42.520- 34:45.260* :  How do you look after your voice on a day-to-day basis?
*34:45.680- 34:47.980* :  Well, I warm up before I sing.
*34:47.980- 34:49.680* :  I drink plenty of water.
*34:50.080- 34:52.720* :  I try and avoid vocal overexertions.
*34:52.720- 34:56.240* :  And that sort of thing, and certainly in the days before performing,
*34:56.240- 34:57.960* :  I'll be particularly careful.
*34:58.280- 35:01.300* :  Things like hydration, as I say, are extremely important to avoiding caffeine
*35:01.780- 35:07.760* :  and clearly avoiding obviously abusive things like smoking and those sorts of things.
*35:07.800- 35:10.360* :  So I'm good tips for the singers out there listening.
*35:10.360- 35:12.380* :  I do need to ask you just before I let you go.
*35:12.960- 35:14.060* :  Are you an Erasmith fan?
*35:14.540- 35:16.720* :  Do you know, I would love to say that I am.
*35:16.720- 35:18.600* :  I'm a fan of all sorts of music.
*35:18.600- 35:20.820* :  I don't know Erasmith's music particularly well,
*35:20.820- 35:22.880* :  but I do know a few of their tracks.
*35:22.880- 35:26.180* :  And honestly, the peak of his power,
*35:26.180- 35:29.340* :  Stephen Tyler, really, did have an extraordinary voice.
*35:29.340- 35:32.580* :  So I'm very envious of his vocal acrobatics.
*35:33.060- 35:36.720* :  Well, I am an Erasmith fan, and I highly recommend that you listen to some of their bank catalog.
*35:37.200- 35:39.520* :  That was the Laryngologist, Dr. Declan Castello.
*35:42.740- 35:43.700* :  That's all from us for now.

*36:52.140- 36:53.040* :  Very dark times.
*36:53.580- 36:54.580* :  People were desperate.
