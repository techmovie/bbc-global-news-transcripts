*01:20.460- 01:26.620* :  another part from the BBC World Service, The Global Story, which takes a deep dive into one
*01:26.620- 01:32.840* :  big news story every weekday. Let me hand over to Katrina Perry for a flavour of what to expect
*01:32.840- 01:38.680* :  when you subscribe. This episode looks at the uncertain future of the world's biggest live streaming
*01:38.680- 01:39.940* :  platform, Twitch.
*01:41.740- 01:49.920* :  Posting more than 240 million active monthly users, Twitch hosts superstar gaming creators
*01:49.920- 01:57.400* :  like Ninja and Kaisenat, with audiences watching over two billion hours of content in June alone.
*02:05.880- 02:10.360* :  But despite these huge numbers, it's struggling to turn a profit,
*02:10.940- 02:15.980* :  and there's speculation that parent company Amazon, which bought the platform for a billion
*02:15.980- 02:22.580* :  dollars a decade ago, could be losing patience. Now rumors are swirling that a third round of
*02:22.580- 02:28.200* :  layoffs within a year are on the horizon. So today we're asking, what went wrong,
*02:28.800- 02:31.080* :  and is Twitch too big to fail?
*02:39.200- 02:43.020* :  With me today, our BBC technology reporter Tom Gurkin, hi Tom.
*02:43.580- 02:48.840* :  Hi, Katrina. And Stefan Powell, a presenter and journalist who was formerly gaming correspondent
*02:48.840- 02:52.420* :  for BBC News. Welcome back Stefan. Hello, lovely to be here.
*02:53.240- 02:58.180* :  Now lots to talk about Twitch here, but I think we need to set out first of all for anyone
*02:58.180- 03:04.380* :  who doesn't know. We need to explain Tom, what is Twitch and how popular is it? Where does
*03:04.380- 03:10.760* :  it sit in the gaming world? It is incredibly popular. As you mentioned in the intro,
*03:10.760- 03:16.520* :  their Twitch has 240 million visitors monthly. But the way that works out if you break it down
*03:16.520- 03:24.400* :  a little bit, it ends up being around about 100,000 live broadcasts taking place on Twitch at any
*03:24.400- 03:30.980* :  given time. I mean, 100,000 people live streaming on Twitch with goodness knows how many people
*03:30.980- 03:36.160* :  watching them live stream between them. That means in the gaming landscape, Twitch is absolutely
*03:36.160- 03:42.720* :  massive and it is the go to place the people who want to have other people watch and play video games.
*03:43.560- 03:49.960* :  Huge numbers there. Stefan, as we know from social media companies, it's not always easy to
*03:49.960- 03:55.100* :  monetize big numbers like that. I think what's been really interesting with Twitch is that it's the
*03:55.100- 04:00.660* :  sort of platform that did well early doors because it changed the nature of the way people engage
*04:00.660- 04:06.060* :  with content. Traditionally, you would watch a television program or watch a movie or a YouTube
*04:06.060- 04:10.940* :  clip and that was your sole focus. Whereas Twitch was really the website that sort of broke through
*04:10.940- 04:15.760* :  on this idea of double screening where people would have their favorite Twitch streamers up on
*04:15.760- 04:21.520* :  screen as they were doing something else. The idea is that you are spending a lot of time with someone
*04:21.560- 04:25.720* :  and that in the first instance seems really attractive to a big company because I will have somebody
*04:25.720- 04:31.100* :  spending five, six hours a day on this website watching their favorite content creators and there
*04:31.100- 04:34.840* :  must be a way of monetizing it. They managed to do that in the early days but it hasn't really
*04:34.840- 04:40.540* :  evolved much past that. If you look at the other big social media platforms like Instagram or
*04:40.540- 04:46.720* :  TikTok or even Twitter or whatever, they have evolved their offering quite a lot over the last
*04:46.720- 04:51.740* :  decade or so. The big news of the day Facebook owned Instagram launching its competitor to TikTok
*04:51.740- 04:57.920* :  today and it's called Reels. It'll let you create 15 second videos using filters, AR and music.
*04:58.480- 05:04.760* :  Twitter is now X maybe Elon Musk rolling out that rebranding this morning. It's part of his long
*05:04.760- 05:10.980* :  held ambition to create an everything app that combines messaging, social networking and payments.
*05:11.260- 05:16.200* :  People use Twitch like it and they like it just the way it is thank you very much and so any
*05:16.200- 05:21.380* :  innovation the changes it too much from its core principles I don't think people are up for which
*05:21.380- 05:24.920* :  is one of the reasons I think it's fairly same in terms of its level of growth. Right and there's
*05:24.920- 05:29.600* :  another problem off the back of this which is that Twitch theoretically is quite simple to monetize
*05:29.600- 05:34.480* :  right you you put adverts when people watch the streams you make people pay a subscription fee
*05:34.480- 05:38.440* :  and Twitch takes a cut and the streamer takes a cut. The problem is what Stefan said,
*05:38.780- 05:43.720* :  that straightforward thing fans like and the streamers don't want it to adjust in any way as well
*05:43.720- 05:49.280* :  when Twitch tried another way of making money by effectively taking part of the sponsorship fees,
*05:49.900- 05:53.880* :  extra deals people were doing outside of it. It got a massive backlash and Twitch just had to
*05:53.880- 05:58.940* :  backtrack immediately so they can't find another way to make money outside of what they're currently
*05:58.940- 06:04.980* :  doing and their CEO says what we're currently doing isn't profitable. We've implied this before
*06:04.980- 06:10.360* :  where we say we need to run it sustainably but I'll be blunt we aren't profitable at this point
*06:10.360- 06:16.480* :  Amazon has been extremely supportive of Twitch and a big thing for being sustainable over time
*06:17.200- 06:22.840* :  is ensuring that we don't lose money and that's a big part of my job because that's going to be
*06:22.840- 06:27.440* :  what makes sure we can be here for a long term. You know this idea of it being a second screen for
*06:27.440- 06:31.260* :  a lot of people are you sometimes you're really engaged with Twitch streamers as they're performing
*06:31.260- 06:37.120* :  some of the top performers you know get lots of people watching them but it's often whilst you're
*06:37.120- 06:41.980* :  doing something else different to you know we've seen podcast advertising for example born recently
*06:41.980- 06:46.440* :  because advertisers think that you are getting an engaged listenership if I'm listening to a podcast
*06:46.440- 06:50.640* :  I'm really listening to it whereas on Twitch if I'm going to put an advert on Twitch when do I
*06:50.640- 06:55.340* :  put it at the beginning of to someone's Twitch stream maybe not everybody's logged on to watch it
*06:55.340- 07:00.380* :  do I put it on after a few hours to just sit in the corner the numbers are big but how engaged
*07:00.380- 07:05.280* :  is that particular audience with that advert at that particular time is really difficult to judge
*07:06.000- 07:10.400* :  and as we know the fabulous listeners to the global story are always very engaged when you're
*07:10.400- 07:16.960* :  talking about engaged podcast listeners there but at Tom with with Twitch struggling to turn a
*07:16.960- 07:22.000* :  profit they're have already been significant job cuts what are we talking about now in terms of
*07:22.880- 07:29.300* :  well at the start of year in January Amazon announced around 500 job cuts that was about a third
*07:29.300- 07:34.400* :  of the people who worked for Twitch that is a really significant amount of cuts and that was
*07:35.000- 07:40.260* :  the latest in a long line at that point there had been several cuts after the pandemic during which
*07:40.260- 07:45.300* :  time lots of tech companies had grown so in a sense it wasn't outside the norm lots and lots of
*07:45.300- 07:49.960* :  tech layoffs there've been hundreds of thousands of tech layoffs since then but it's still significant
*07:49.960- 07:55.940* :  a huge percentage of the employees they had they don't have anymore and that obviously has
*07:55.940- 08:00.720* :  significant challenges that come with it you can't just lose loads and loads of people that
*08:00.720- 08:07.060* :  worked for you and that not have an impact you're going to see that in the stability of the platform
*08:07.060- 08:12.140* :  over time you're going to see that in the way that creators are dealt with and the interactions
*08:12.140- 08:17.500* :  that they have and if there are more to come which we don't know by the way it is hard to see
*08:17.580- 08:23.200* :  where they could come from now that Twitch has such a small amount of people working for it I mean
*08:23.200- 08:28.560* :  big companies companies which are getting as we said hundreds of millions of uses they have a
*08:28.560- 08:34.200* :  heck of a lot more people working for them than a thousand so it is a real issue and it's quite
*08:34.200- 08:38.380* :  hard to imagine where these cuts are going to come from so we're talking about cuts there but let's
*08:38.380- 08:43.380* :  just take it back a little bit and talk about the evolution of the company Stefan tell us about
*08:44.240- 08:49.580* :  how it launched and how it came to have such a large user base so much so that made Amazon
*08:49.580- 08:55.980* :  want to buy it this is nightly business report with Tyler Mappesen and Susie Gary
*08:56.940- 09:02.500* :  Amazon is making a major move into the lucrative video game business the internet giant is buying
*09:02.500- 09:08.120* :  Twitch for almost a billion dollars in cash one of Amazon's biggest acquisitions ever what Twitch
*09:08.120- 09:13.480* :  there is it touched into the magic of radio I think you know with all the changes in technology
*09:13.480- 09:18.560* :  and how people consume information and engage with the media over the years radio has probably been
*09:18.560- 09:23.120* :  the main stay throughout that time and it stayed with people because it feels like you're connected
*09:23.120- 09:29.900* :  as a society and you're with friends sort of all of the time and what Twitch offered you was a
*09:29.940- 09:36.000* :  visual version of that and so it gave creators the space to build up relationships with their
*09:36.000- 09:42.460* :  communities in a different way than say YouTube did because you were live so it had that the
*09:42.560- 09:47.360* :  mix of great visuals you get from a video game platform because video games are very visual of
*09:47.360- 09:51.280* :  course but it gave you that same connection with the audience that the radio does because they're
*09:51.280- 09:55.680* :  always there and you tune in and you become someone sort of comfort blanket someone's best friend
*09:55.680- 10:01.620* :  and that made it unique and also I think the tech behind it worked very well so you could instantly
*10:01.620- 10:05.560* :  communicate with your creators and they would react to you live and that was a bit of a thrill
*10:06.080- 10:10.080* :  you know if you're watching somebody play a video game Fortnite is sort of one of the the big
*10:10.080- 10:14.860* :  title still on Twitch even to this day when Fortnite was in its preeminent early years the fact
*10:14.860- 10:19.560* :  that I could message Ninja who's one of the big Twitch streamers say I think you should land
*10:19.600- 10:24.760* :  on this part of the island next and him be able to oh I've seen Stefan's message so I'm going to
*10:24.760- 10:29.900* :  do what he says that is an instant gratification that you don't you didn't have from other platforms
*10:29.900- 10:40.260* :  like YouTube at the time so that's what made it so popular and I think there was an assumption
*10:40.260- 10:47.000* :  then from Amazon when it bought it that this connection that worked so well in the video game space
*10:47.740- 10:53.760* :  was going to branch out into other areas okay so you will have it you know being super popular for
*10:53.760- 10:59.360* :  people who like to knit or or go running that hasn't really happened which is why I don't think
*10:59.360- 11:04.920* :  it has grown to the level that Amazon expected it to twitch has become super successful within the
*11:04.920- 11:10.700* :  video game space it's not just the ninjas and the pokemonis and the Tommy and it's of this world
*11:10.700- 11:16.140* :  that that used twitch you know my mate Dave who streams to a hundred people is also on it so you've
*11:16.140- 11:21.960* :  got all these big numbers and it grew there really quickly but then I think it hit a glass ceiling
*11:21.960- 11:27.140* :  in terms of that it hasn't broken out from the game space which is why then hasn't gone to find
*11:27.140- 11:32.400* :  new audiences and grown in the way that I think Amazon was perhaps expecting it to and the peak of
*11:32.400- 11:37.880* :  that time was surely during the covert pandemic when people couldn't leave their homes and couldn't
*11:37.880- 11:43.520* :  see their friends and connections in any other way so that inevitability isn't it the new games
*11:43.520- 11:49.240* :  in general saw record sales over that time period because a lot of people were out of work and
*11:49.240- 11:54.200* :  needed something to do and it is as simple as that to some extent obviously twitch found a similar
*11:54.200- 12:00.040* :  success because of that obviously lots of different things were going on there as well and actually
*12:00.040- 12:05.520* :  there's so many little interesting things that happened within twitch over that space chess became
*12:05.520- 12:11.980* :  incredibly popular on twitch during that point chess grandmasters like Daniel Naroditsky are still
*12:11.980- 12:17.260* :  super popular streamers with hundreds of thousands of followers because during covid the kind of
*12:17.260- 12:22.360* :  people that might not normally use twitch started using start to become interesting chess they also
*12:22.360- 12:26.320* :  got a lot of young people into chess I'll stop talking about chess the point is they did manage to
*12:26.320- 12:31.740* :  see some success in slightly other different areas during covid as more people came to the platform
*12:31.740- 12:37.340* :  that's a problem they had when people started to leave the platform when switch was starting to
*12:37.340- 12:42.980* :  find a bit of success elsewhere and the core audience became the focus once again it all became
*12:42.980- 12:48.740* :  back gaming as it I think sort of has to a Stefan was saying there's a glass ceiling there and
*12:48.740- 12:53.440* :  it's really really difficult to see how it could smash through well let's talk for a minute about
*12:53.440- 12:59.920* :  those mega stars and Stefan's mate Dave with his 100 100 people watching him but we leave Dave
*12:59.920- 13:05.020* :  as I've resigned let's talk about ninja kysonette guys like that that's led to this kind of broader
*13:05.020- 13:10.880* :  ecosystem where there are now sponsored public events all over the world which thousands attend and
*13:10.880- 13:16.360* :  presumably a lot of those things are making money what people do is they use twitches the platform
*13:16.360- 13:21.800* :  to grow themselves as a as a personality as an individual and they monetize themselves and I
*13:21.800- 13:25.440* :  suppose twitch like Tom was referring to earlier are getting frustrated that they're not able to take
*13:25.440- 13:30.940* :  a slice of that pie we're making these mega stars but we're only able to monetize the bits that
*13:30.940- 13:35.740* :  they do on our platform but I think it was sort of towards ever thus for media platforms I think
*13:35.740- 13:41.480* :  that's that's just how that ecosystem and that financial world works but I'm not too sure if
*13:41.620- 13:47.220* :  stripping their staff base right down cutting it to the board whilst it looks good on a spreadsheet
*13:47.220- 13:51.880* :  ultimately I think that is going to create problems for the platform going forward because if they've
*13:51.880- 13:56.640* :  only got a thousand staff and you've got a hundred thousand people streaming on your website that's
*13:56.640- 14:00.920* :  like a hundred thousand radio stations or TV channels and you've got to be across what they're
*14:00.920- 14:06.860* :  putting out there into the world you know it's had some difficulties in the past regulating what
*14:06.860- 14:13.280* :  people are are putting out on twitch which has led to sort of issues in terms of its corporate look
*14:13.320- 14:18.180* :  and then if you have more of those scandals then you become worth less in the long run so I can see
*14:18.180- 14:22.600* :  why on a spreadsheet you'd want to cut the number of staff there because you're paying out less
*14:22.600- 14:27.040* :  money but then that can also have a long-term effect so it's in a really caught between a rock
*14:27.040- 14:32.840* :  and a hard place and it's it's those big names like ninja i'm just a type and i freak out just
*14:32.840- 14:43.160* :  as much son of a or you kidding me get this out of the game who is pulling in you know 19
*14:43.160- 14:48.700* :  million followers or whatever he's got on twitch or porky money or things the number one female
*14:48.700- 14:52.300* :  streamer with nine odd million i'm sorry the song is even with a t-beach
*14:53.740- 15:03.860* :  so it looks like to you thanks guys those are the big tent poles that sort of bring people into your
*15:03.860- 15:07.760* :  platform but you've got to look after the other ones as well otherwise that can really impact
*15:07.760- 15:12.940* :  your corporate responsibility and your corporate image losing those staff members as well it is
*15:12.940- 15:19.500* :  quite a significant test if they're going to keep having big public events i mean twitch runs twitch
*15:19.500- 15:24.400* :  con the last North American event had 20,000 attendees this is a big money split for twitch as well
*15:24.400- 15:29.160* :  they have a charge hundreds of dollars for tickets to this thing i think it's around $250 if you
*15:29.160- 15:35.600* :  want to go for the whole weekend welcome to the best day of the year welcome to twitch rivals
*15:36.180- 15:41.160* :  live at twitch con rotted and it is there too which means it is ultimate challenge there and
*15:41.500- 15:46.860* :  you multiply 250 by 20,000 it's a lot of money for twitch this kind of thing and obviously you
*15:46.860- 15:54.800* :  can't really run those events effectively if you're cutting your staff numbers so we've looked at
*15:54.840- 16:00.260* :  twitch's past success and struggles next the competitors who are looking to pants
*16:04.960- 16:11.760* :  this season insta cart has your back to school as in they've got your back to school lunch favorites
*16:11.760- 16:17.640* :  like snack packs and fresh fruit and they've got your back to school supplies like backpacks binders

*17:31.560- 17:38.120* :  follow or subscribe wherever you listen with me today our tom girkin and staff and pal
*17:38.580- 17:44.760* :  tom the most obvious competitor to twitch when it comes to live streaming is youtube what sort of
*17:44.760- 17:49.400* :  challenge does youtube pose to twitch this is something staff was talking about earlier that i
*17:49.400- 17:54.340* :  think is really really important youtube does pose a threat right there's no question youtube really
*17:54.340- 17:59.040* :  wants to get into the live streaming space google which owns youtube has put a lot of money into this
*17:59.260- 18:05.480* :  to make the live streaming offering effective fast because you want when you make a comment for it to
*18:05.480- 18:10.100* :  be seen by the person streaming as quickly as possible live streaming on youtube is a great way
*18:10.100- 18:15.300* :  to connect with your audience in real time when you're streaming an event teaching a class
*18:15.300- 18:22.180* :  playing video games performing for your fans posting a q&a youtube has all of the tools that will
*18:22.180- 18:29.940* :  help you manage your stream so youtube desperately wants a piece of this pie but creators really don't
*18:30.340- 18:35.540* :  because if you're a creator what you want to be able to do is stream as many platforms as possible
*18:35.800- 18:40.140* :  there's always going to be exclusive deals but the best thing a creator can do is have their stream go
*18:40.480- 18:45.920* :  on twitch have a stream on youtube have a stream elsewhere and interact with people on those
*18:45.920- 18:50.820* :  different locations but there's something else going on here too which is what Steph mentioned earlier
*18:50.980- 18:55.920* :  when you're watching a twitch stream it is something you often do on a second screen people watch
*18:55.920- 19:00.320* :  youtube in a very similar way to how people watch Netflix it's something you might be putting on
*19:00.720- 19:05.120* :  on the big tally while you're sat on your sofa and because those audiences are a bit different
*19:05.120- 19:12.140* :  because twitch really prioritise that live interaction it means you're just going to struggle to see
*19:12.560- 19:18.320* :  a bigger threat that youtube might take a big piece of the pie and Stefan there are more junior
*19:18.320- 19:25.560* :  rivals one example is kick which highly incentivizes creators through generous revenue sharing
*19:25.560- 19:30.920* :  is that forcing twitch into a corner somewhat i don't think it's made as much of a splashes they were
*19:30.920- 19:37.020* :  hoping for when kick was launched and they you know try to grab some big streamers and move them
*19:37.020- 19:41.640* :  across to the platform i think it's been hit by a number of controversies about some of the content
*19:41.640- 19:46.380* :  that is ended up on kick and some of the behavior that some of the streamers that you use kick
*19:46.380- 19:51.420* :  have broadcasts but loads of people have come for twitch if you will in the past and have failed
*19:51.540- 19:56.140* :  there was a platform called mixer which was backed by microsoft right and you when you had your
*19:56.140- 20:01.700* :  Xbox it would link to a mixer account and they tried to be twitch at its own game it started in
*20:01.700- 20:08.380* :  2016 it shut down in 2020 you know and and that had taken a lot of content creators from twitch over
*20:08.560- 20:15.180* :  major news dropped just minutes ago microsoft mixer is shutting down and there is a partnership
*20:15.180- 20:21.440* :  in place with facebook gaming let's read the details here so both mixer and facebook gaming
*20:21.440- 20:27.660* :  put up blog posts and the gist of it is microsoft mixer is shutting down the operation side
*20:28.000- 20:32.080* :  so even though there are big names on twitch there is something about its place in the market
*20:32.080- 20:37.200* :  is really cemented itself is at the heart of the games market and also i just think the way that
*20:37.200- 20:42.360* :  it works just the ease of use of the software has made it a supremely popular and the game's
*20:42.420- 20:46.640* :  companies engage a lot with it you know when they release a new game they will be partnering a lot
*20:46.640- 20:52.460* :  with twitch content creators and they work a lot in that way so just twitch is such an integral part
*20:52.460- 20:57.540* :  of the gaming ecosystem now economically but also perhaps more significantly than that culturally
*20:57.540- 21:03.300* :  to take that away is going to be really difficult kick does have this nice revenue share you know
*21:03.300- 21:08.780* :  where on twitch at the moment it's a 50 50 split when you start out it can get better it can
*21:08.780- 21:14.780* :  become you get 60% of the amount people subscribe and it can even go up to 70% and the big streamers
*21:14.780- 21:20.360* :  get more kick goes right in says hey listen you get 95% of the money you earn on this platform please
*21:20.360- 21:26.480* :  come here but like Steph said the reality is if a massive audience is on twitch already it just
*21:26.480- 21:32.820* :  doesn't do you any favors as a creator to try and start out on kick when 95% of a small amount of
*21:32.820- 21:39.560* :  money is something 60% of a much larger amount of money is obviously better so with the layoffs
*21:39.560- 21:44.300* :  with the job cuts with all of those questions that we've been discussing how much
*21:44.300- 21:51.460* :  jeopardy is there for twitch release Stefan is there at risk of losing creators or as you've been
*21:51.460- 21:55.880* :  saying they're they don't really have many other places to go yeah it's interesting I you know
*21:55.880- 22:00.400* :  I think it's sort of like a business question isn't it because it's his sense that big companies
*22:00.400- 22:05.620* :  are obsessed with growth right you can be a profitable company that is sort of culturally significant
*22:05.620- 22:09.960* :  and making you money but if you're not making more money than you were the year before then your
*22:09.960- 22:15.960* :  deems to not be successful twitch is struggling to find a way of making itself profitable I can't
*22:15.960- 22:21.560* :  quite wrap my head round as why it's not a success economically because culturally it's really
*22:21.560- 22:26.440* :  nailed it it's slapping in the middle of the hearts and minds of engaged gamers across the world
*22:26.720- 22:31.680* :  and I think what ultimately happened is that it'll perhaps find a little niche for itself there
*22:31.680- 22:36.520* :  and it will sit there forever but in terms of becoming sort of the preeminent platform the people
*22:36.520- 22:40.120* :  go to view their content on I don't think it is going to be that and I think that's what Amazon's
*22:40.120- 22:45.580* :  guess was when it took it over Tom how do you think it's adjusting to stay competitive I mean
*22:45.580- 22:51.280* :  it's revamped the app there's a feed now kind of like a tick-tock feed there yeah that is I think
*22:51.280- 22:56.080* :  a direct response to the fact that there are a lot of creators now who are posting short-form
*22:56.080- 23:00.580* :  videos on tick-tock but doing very very well I think the main adjustments they've made around
*23:00.580- 23:05.400* :  this area of revenue sharing that is the main thing it's done rather than the visual something behind
*23:05.400- 23:10.980* :  the scenes we don't know what it's doing in terms of revenue sharing with the big creators we don't
*23:10.980- 23:16.240* :  know those numbers we can estimate they get an incredibly large slice of the pie much more than
*23:16.240- 23:21.040* :  other creators do it wouldn't be outrageous to suggest that people like Kai Sanat are getting 90
*23:21.040- 23:25.540* :  percent of the money on the platform wouldn't be outrageous to suggest that we don't know though but
*23:25.780- 23:32.760* :  Twitch is going to I would imagine keep trying this kind of thing to find a balance whereby they
*23:32.760- 23:39.000* :  can pay out less money and find a way to profitability when Amazon bought Twitch they bought it for
*23:39.000- 23:45.680* :  just under a billion dollars last year Twitch paid out over a billion dollars just to its
*23:45.680- 23:53.040* :  streamers to the people making content for it that is its big number one problem and it's so
*23:53.040- 23:58.740* :  hard to find an answer to that if it cuts the number down people will look at where else they can
*23:58.740- 24:03.780* :  go the top ones anyway there's a juxtaposition right there's a question that remains an answer and
*24:03.780- 24:10.260* :  what is or who is Twitch for because it does both things its services your smaller communities you
*24:10.260- 24:15.180* :  know whether it's my midday with a hundred people to watch his stuff or it's your guilds in
*24:15.180- 24:19.300* :  World of Warcraft that all watch each other's content and it's a way of maintaining your community
*24:19.300- 24:26.880* :  like a community radio station if you will in that space or is it a place for ninja and kai to come
*24:26.880- 24:31.620* :  on and share their thoughts with millions of people at the moment it's servicing both the
*24:31.620- 24:34.940* :  reason that people don't like change on Twitch is because I think that they love the thought of
*24:35.320- 24:38.920* :  being able to broadcast to everybody and at the same time watch some of their favorite stars but
*24:38.920- 24:43.440* :  I think being able to do both requires slightly different financial models maybe and that feeds
*24:43.440- 24:49.120* :  into the reporting from the Wall Street Journal you know they're attributing fears to staff that
*24:49.120- 24:55.660* :  it could become a zombie brand sooned into amazon starved of resources left to run with the
*24:55.660- 25:01.860* :  minimal oversight but the brand would still be there it would still be the go to place for gamers
*25:01.860- 25:06.920* :  and those big mega stars and the community what do you think of that Tom the funny thing is I
*25:06.920- 25:12.120* :  think that to some extent people who who use Twitch some of the big fans of the platform might
*25:12.120- 25:17.180* :  be quite happy with that the suggestion that it would just be left to its own devices and it
*25:17.180- 25:21.500* :  wouldn't change I mean that's sort of every internet users dream that their favorite platform
*25:21.500- 25:27.980* :  doesn't change I think the zombie brand isn't the fear it's that twitch might look at some other
*25:27.980- 25:32.660* :  regions in the world and go doesn't make money there so we'll get rid of it that's what they did
*25:32.660- 25:37.620* :  with South Korea twitch wasn't making enough money there amazon which owns it just went you know
*25:37.620- 25:42.200* :  what we're never going to make enough money in this area forget it we're shutting it down that
*25:42.200- 25:47.660* :  is possible twitch has done it before it could so easily look at other regions in the world to go you
*25:47.660- 25:51.340* :  know what we're not making enough money in Italy we're not making enough money in Finland because
*25:51.340- 25:55.380* :  our servers aren't located in the right place to be able to so we're actually going to shut it down
*25:55.380- 26:00.360* :  in lots of different areas this is not something which amazon has said it's going to do by the way
*26:00.360- 26:05.480* :  there is absolutely no reason to speculate for this might happen it's just that this is the real
*26:05.480- 26:12.620* :  concern that fans have okay so final verdict from you both the original question is it too big
*26:12.620- 26:19.020* :  to fail is it too big to fade into the background where will it be in another decade do you know
*26:19.020- 26:26.640* :  what first to second time there's a big question I think that twitch holds a very significant part
*26:26.640- 26:32.580* :  in the internet landscape for me it's almost inconceivable to imagine a world where twitch
*26:32.580- 26:38.160* :  becomes used less let alone anything else but hey you know twitter was something that every
*26:38.160- 26:44.060* :  single person used and then twitter got bought by somebody else twitter became x and a lot of
*26:44.060- 26:50.540* :  people criticizing the way x is currently run I think that there are potential parallels if amazon
*26:50.540- 26:56.340* :  for example decided actually someone else can take it off our hands and give it a go there's
*26:56.340- 27:01.260* :  certainly a world where that happens and then twitch's future looks very different but so long
*27:01.260- 27:06.820* :  as it's underneath amazon I think that that company would be risking so much ill will if they let
*27:06.820- 27:12.560* :  anything bad happens of twitch but I think it's pretty safe for now yeah I think the future of
*27:12.560- 27:18.140* :  twitch actually it sort of sees it move away from the focus on big streamers which I think might
*27:18.140- 27:22.760* :  sound counted intuitive I think it becomes more of a community tool that gamers across the world
*27:22.760- 27:29.680* :  use regularly and I think ultimately you're not going to be able to satiate financially ninja for
*27:29.680- 27:33.420* :  example okay like they're going to make so much money and if you're an entire point is trying to
*27:33.420- 27:38.020* :  keep them happy and then you spend all of your focus on those guys and they suddenly decide tomorrow
*27:38.020- 27:42.860* :  they're going to stop twitch streaming because it's actually really hard work broadcasting 8 to 10
*27:42.860- 27:46.840* :  hours a day every day is not caring now when you they realize you know what I can make just as much
*27:46.840- 27:51.440* :  money by making one short form tiktok or one short form instagram post a day I'm just going to do
*27:51.440- 27:56.040* :  that culturally now I think it is set in stone as part of the gaming community for the next 10
*27:56.040- 28:01.240* :  years or so whether or not it maintains this place this all encompassing platform that you go
*28:01.240- 28:06.660* :  for big celebrities I'm not sure but I still think video games players and companies will be streaming
*28:06.660- 28:10.800* :  on twitch for years and years and years to come well with all of these things where will we even be
*28:10.800- 28:17.760* :  in a year let alone a decade fascinating chat with the both of you there about twitch lots to watch
