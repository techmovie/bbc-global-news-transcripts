*01:15.880- 01:19.000* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:22.060- 01:26.960* :  I'm Paul Moss, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 28th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:27.020- 01:32.200* :  The Lodemy Zalensky says Ukraine's expanding incursion into Russia's curse region
*01:32.660- 01:36.000* :  is part of a victory plan that he'll soon present to President Biden.
*01:36.740- 01:41.500* :  Israeli commandos have freed one of the hostages held in Gaza. Our correspondent in Jerusalem
*01:41.500- 01:46.880* :  gives us the details. And US officials say a tanker that sublays in the Red Sea
*01:47.400- 01:50.820* :  appears to be leaking oil after it was attacked by Houthi fighters.
*01:53.880- 01:57.240* :  Also in this podcast, I think you could compare it to maple syrup.
*01:58.960- 02:04.160* :  This you could put on your toast. This is very sweet. We visit a laboratory in Switzerland
*02:04.760- 02:06.960* :  where they're working on a new way to make chocolate.
*02:11.620- 02:16.020* :  It was perhaps a surprising day for Vladimir Zalensky to talk about victory.
*02:16.020- 02:20.180* :  Ukraine had suffered a second night of drone and missile attacks,
*02:20.620- 02:25.180* :  while Russian troops in the Donbass continue to move closer to capturing the strategically
*02:25.180- 02:30.720* :  important town of Povrosk. But on the positive side for Ukraine, there is of course the fact that
*02:30.720- 02:36.200* :  their forces still occupy a chunk of Russian territory. And what President Zalensky said
*02:36.200- 02:41.540* :  was that this would form the key part of a victory plan he wants to put to the United States.
*02:42.040- 02:48.980* :  The operation in the Kursk region is a part of the plan about which I'll be talking with
*02:48.980- 02:55.560* :  President Biden. The main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war. And I really
*02:55.560- 03:01.680* :  wanted to end on fair terms for Ukraine. If the plan is accepted and delivered, which is also
*03:01.680- 03:05.900* :  very important, then we believe that our main aim will be reached.
*03:06.400- 03:11.260* :  Earlier, Mr. Zalensky's military chief, Alexander Syrsky, said Ukraine now controlled
*03:11.260- 03:16.940* :  100 settlements in Kursk. A reporter Nick Beek is in the Sumi region close to the border
*03:17.500- 03:21.820* :  that has been hearing more about what the Ukrainians hope to achieve through their incursion.
*03:22.220- 03:28.380* :  Today, the Ukrainians said that they've continued to take more land that in that time they captured
*03:28.380- 03:34.060* :  around 600 Russian prisoners of war. And all the indications we've seen over the past couple
*03:34.060- 03:37.940* :  of days is that they've got absolutely no intention of giving up this territory.
*03:37.940- 03:43.060* :  Russia says there will be a response to this. It's unclear whether what we've seen in the last
*03:43.060- 03:48.260* :  couple of days or so constitutes this response or whether there is more punishment to come to use
*03:48.260- 03:53.940* :  the word that Vladimir Putin has been using. As for President Zalensky today, he's been talking
*03:53.940- 03:59.220* :  about a victory plan. He says he wants to take this to the United States. He wants to present it
*03:59.220- 04:05.360* :  to President Biden. And he says the aim here is really to put Ukraine in the strongest possible
*04:05.360- 04:11.460* :  position so that Russia can be brought to the negotiating table. The problem is if you listen
*04:11.460- 04:17.180* :  to the Kremlin, if you listen to President Putin, he's saying at the moment there is simply nothing
*04:17.180- 04:22.860* :  to talk about. Big Beek. There's one aspect of this conflict which the whole world is now being
*04:22.860- 04:28.500* :  urged to talk about, or at least care about. The head of the United Nations Nuclear Watchdog has
*04:28.500- 04:32.760* :  warned there's a risk of an incident at a nuclear power plant close to where the
*04:32.760- 04:37.480* :  fighting's being taken place in Russia's Kursk region. Rafale-Grossi visited the plant,
*04:37.900- 04:41.120* :  following Russian claims that it's been attacked by Ukrainian forces,
*04:41.580- 04:47.680* :  her Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports. War is bad enough, but a nuclear power plant
*04:47.680- 04:56.440* :  in a war zone, that is a potential disaster. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
*04:56.440- 05:02.980* :  Rafale-Grossi visited Russia's Kursk nuclear power plant less than 30 miles from the fighting.
*05:03.600- 05:08.680* :  Three weeks ago, thousands of Ukrainian troops had broken through the border into Kursk region
*05:08.680- 05:15.100* :  and had begun seizing territory. Russia has accused Ukraine of trying to attack the power plant
*05:15.100- 05:21.540* :  with drones. Without attributing responsibility, Rafale-Grossi confirmed there had been what he
*05:21.540- 05:40.500* :  called activity near the facility. Like Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear accident,
*05:41.080- 05:47.000* :  which had no protective dome, neither does the Kursk plant. That makes it very exposed.
*05:47.820- 05:53.480* :  According to the picture painted by Moscow, only one country right now is a threat to nuclear
*05:54.020- 06:01.100* :  safety, and that is Ukraine, but it's a picture that omits a key detail. In the last two and a half
*06:01.100- 06:08.700* :  years, only one country has invaded its neighbor and seized a nuclear power station, and that is Russia.
*06:09.180- 06:13.180* :  Its army occupied the Zepparizia nuclear plant in 2022.
*06:14.100- 06:19.560* :  Early this month, Russia and Ukraine traded accusations over a fire there at a cooling tower.
*06:19.560- 06:25.900* :  President Zelensky has accused Russia of using the plant to blackmail Ukraine, all of Europe
*06:25.900- 06:32.580* :  and the world. That report by Steve Rosenberg. We still don't know how the Israeli military
*06:32.580- 06:37.820* :  managed to free another hostage from captivity in Gaza, as spokesman would only say it was a
*06:38.060- 06:42.860* :  complex operation, carried out by commandos, while a group that campaigns on behalf of the
*06:42.860- 06:49.280* :  hostages said it was miraculous. But given that Kaid Farhan Alkadi had been held for nearly 11 months,
*06:49.840- 06:54.880* :  and that he was apparently rescued from an underground tunnel, the 52-year-old father is
*06:54.880- 07:00.200* :  reportedly in pretty robust condition. Mr Alkadi is a Bedwin Arab citizen of Israel,
*07:00.200- 07:05.180* :  and had been working as a guard at a warehouse when he was abducted by Hamas during the attacks
*07:05.180- 07:10.000* :  on the 7th of October, a Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has this report.
*07:13.500- 07:19.760* :  After 326 days as a hostage, Farhan Alkadi walked off an Israeli military helicopter
*07:20.540- 07:27.360* :  back into his life, a Bedwin father of 11 kidnapped from the kibbutz where he worked as a security guard,
*07:28.160- 07:32.900* :  from a tunnel in Gaza to Israel's Soraka Hospital in a couple of hours.
*07:35.540- 07:40.840* :  His family, racing the last few meters to greet him. Among them, his brother,
*07:40.840- 07:47.420* :  Hatham Alkadi. It's difficult to explain how it feels. It's better than having a new born.
*07:47.420- 07:52.980* :  We thank God and we thank everyone, and hope to see him healthy. We're very happy, very happy.
*07:53.820- 08:00.060* :  Photographs released by the hospital show him thin and pale, but staff said the 52-year-old was
*08:00.060- 08:06.720* :  in a good and stable condition. Reports in local media that Mr Alkadi had managed to escape without
*08:06.720- 08:14.000* :  help from Israeli forces were denied by the army. Its spokesman Daniel Hagari said special forces
*08:14.000- 08:18.460* :  had extracted him from the tunnel and that many others still remained in captivity.
*08:18.460- 08:27.960* :  There are still 108 hostages whose families are still waiting to hear news that their loved ones
*08:27.960- 08:37.260* :  are home and they should know that we will not rest. We will not rest until we fulfill our mission
*08:37.260- 08:46.020* :  to bring all our hostages back home. Last week, Israel brought back the bodies of six other hostages.
*08:46.460- 08:53.460* :  The funeral of one, Kaim Perry, was held in Israel today, the joy of one family and the grief of
*08:53.460- 08:59.740* :  another, a trickle of hostages returning as a ceasefire deal remained stubbornly out of reach.
*09:00.400- 09:05.520* :  That report by Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem. The Pentagon says a tanker in the Red Sea,
*09:05.520- 09:09.260* :  which was recently attacked by Houthi fighters, is still on fire.
*09:09.820- 09:14.520* :  It appears to be leaking oil. The Greek-flagged Sunyan has been a blaze off the coast of Yemen.
*09:14.520- 09:18.060* :  From Washington, here's our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman.
*09:18.500- 09:22.800* :  The tanker was attacked by Houthi militants as it transited the Red Sea last week.
*09:23.120- 09:26.280* :  It is a Greek-flagged vessel called the MV Sunyan.
*09:26.280- 09:33.760* :  Its 25 strong crew were rescued by a European naval ship, which it said destroyed a drone attack vessel nearby.
*09:33.760- 09:39.280* :  The oil tanker was later attacked again. The Houthi's posted a video purportedly showing them
*09:39.280- 09:44.300* :  setting it on fire. The Pentagon now says the tanker appears to be leaking oil,
*09:44.300- 09:47.360* :  and the tug sent to salvage it were also threatened.
*09:48.000- 09:53.480* :  The Sunyan is carrying 150,000 tons of crude oil, posing an environmental hazard, say,
*09:53.480- 09:58.460* :  shipping officials. If a major spill occurs, it has the potential to be among the largest
*09:58.460- 10:03.860* :  from a ship in recorded history. The Iran-backed Houthis who control much of Yemen have been
*10:03.860- 10:09.100* :  attacking ships in the Red Sea for 10 months in solidarity with Palestinians facing Israel's
*10:09.100- 10:14.600* :  military assault in Gaza. They have reportedly sunk two ships and killed at least three crew in
*10:14.600- 10:20.660* :  that time. Tom Bayman. A truck driver in Pakistan was among a group of people who were all
*10:20.660- 10:26.700* :  apparently killed by the Baloch Liberation Army, which has claimed responsibility for a string of
*10:26.700- 10:32.540* :  murderous attacks, but it seems this one saw one fortunate man improbably survive as Olivia
*10:32.540- 10:36.780* :  Noon reports. Munir Ahmed was driving with colleagues in a convoy of trucks,
*10:36.780- 10:42.240* :  armed men on the highway stopped the vehicles before ordering them out and shooting them. Mr Ahmed,
*10:42.240- 10:47.200* :  who is from the Punjab, was later picked up by rescuers, along with other lifeless bodies before
*10:47.200- 10:52.600* :  they were transported to a hospital. At the hospital medical staff discovered that he was still alive.
*10:52.620- 10:57.480* :  They say he had been hit by five bullets in the arm and back, but was in a stable condition.
*10:58.240- 11:02.540* :  Speaking from the hospital, Mr Ahmed said he and the other men had been left for dead,
*11:02.540- 11:09.040* :  with men's bodies thrown into a stream. Olivia Noon. Donald Trump might be forgiven for
*11:09.040- 11:14.120* :  thinking he was legally home and dry, at least as far as those allegations that he tried to
*11:14.120- 11:19.620* :  overturn the 2020 election result. After all, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents were
*11:19.620- 11:25.600* :  partially immune to criminal prosecution. But it seems prosecutors do still think he is vulnerable.
*11:25.600- 11:30.440* :  They found a way around the Supreme Court ruling, and they think they've issued a revised
*11:30.440- 11:35.460* :  indictment that will nail Donald Trump. But then as our North America correspondent John
*11:35.460- 11:40.520* :  Sardworth explained, Mr. Trump continues to insist he was right all along.
*11:41.980- 11:47.620* :  Well, Donald Trump has, of course, never stopped repeating the claim made completely without
*11:47.620- 11:53.640* :  foundation that he won the 2020 election. The falsehood that Joe Biden won essentially
*11:53.660- 12:00.760* :  as a result of voter fraud. And there could be little doubt that Mr. Trump attempted to cling
*12:00.760- 12:06.940* :  to power. But question has always been, was that attempt criminal? Now, the Justice Department clearly
*12:06.940- 12:13.880* :  thinks it was. It brought charges against him in 2023. But Mr. Trump is a man, of course,
*12:13.880- 12:20.100* :  with deep pockets. The cases run into all sorts of delay and challenges against it, not least
*12:20.100- 12:25.580* :  the challenge that was taken right to the very pinnacle of the US legal system, to the Supreme
*12:25.580- 12:32.140* :  Court, where Mr. Trump enjoys a conservative super majority. Three of those justices are
*12:32.140- 12:38.740* :  pointed during his time in office. And they issued the landmark ruling a few months ago that said,
*12:39.180- 12:46.300* :  Mr. Trump enjoys broad immunity from prosecution, particularly for acts related to his official
*12:46.640- 12:51.840* :  business. Many people said that they shattered the existing precedent that nobody was above the law.
*12:51.840- 12:56.360* :  But there you are, the prosecutors have had to go away, reconsider the indictment. And they
*12:56.360- 13:02.460* :  have now removed parts of it that relate to Mr. Trump's official instruction. So, for example,
*13:02.460- 13:07.100* :  where perhaps before they included examples of him instructing government lawyers,
*13:07.860- 13:12.740* :  those bits have now come out. And the conspiracy that they're charging him with involves only him
*13:12.740- 13:17.980* :  and private actors, his own private lawyers, for example. The charges remain the same,
*13:17.980- 13:25.660* :  essentially that Mr. Trump attempted to obstruct and defraud the American voters as a whole in
*13:25.660- 13:30.580* :  their right to see the results of that election respected. But what we should really point out,
*13:30.580- 13:34.900* :  of course, are two things here. Firstly, it's very unlikely that this case will now be heard
*13:34.900- 13:40.660* :  before the election. So you might say it's all academic. But because we're unlikely to hear it
*13:40.660- 13:46.600* :  before the election, in some ways it raises the stakes. Because, of course, if Mr. Trump loses
*13:46.600- 13:52.860* :  in November, well, then he almost certainly is going to face this new revised indictment.
*13:53.240- 13:57.600* :  If he wins, he'll be able to tell the Justice Department to put a stop to it.
*14:02.260- 14:08.520* :  Still to come, we spent our entire life working, caring for our children, giving them the best.
*14:09.340- 14:14.740* :  We didn't have time to travel. We also didn't have the money to do it as well before. So why not do it now?
*14:15.420- 14:19.280* :  With a growing number of older people in India, we hear how companies are hoping
*14:19.280- 14:21.940* :  to cash in on the so-called silver economy.

*15:37.380- 15:41.640* :  Imagine escaping from a tyrannical regime, finding refuge abroad,
*15:41.640- 15:45.100* :  and then being told that you're going to be forcibly returned there.
*15:45.100- 15:50.120* :  That is the current fate of the Belarusian writer and filmmaker Andrei Gignot.
*15:50.640- 15:55.840* :  Four years ago, he took part in protests against the country's autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko,
*15:56.420- 15:59.700* :  and also helped record critical statements from prominent athletes,
*16:00.360- 16:02.920* :  like many dissident figures Gignot fled abroad.
*16:03.660- 16:08.120* :  But a court in Serbia is now considering whether to extradite him back to Belarus.
*16:08.140- 16:13.220* :  It was originally Interpol that issued an arrest warrant. Belarus said they wanted him for
*16:13.220- 16:18.880* :  tax evasion. Interpols now drop the request, yet the extradition attempt is going ahead.
*16:18.880- 16:21.940* :  As our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reigns would explain,
*16:22.580- 16:28.520* :  that might be because Mr Gignot's activities touched a particular raw nerve for the Belarusian
*16:28.520- 16:34.660* :  president. We now know that he is the man behind a very prominent campaign, uniting very well-known
*16:34.660- 16:40.640* :  athletes in Belarus against what they describe as the dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko.
*16:41.100- 16:45.720* :  This was after the mass protests in 2020 against a rigged presidential election,
*16:45.720- 16:51.980* :  huge crowds on the streets. And Mr Gignot was involved in those opposition protests,
*16:52.140- 16:57.740* :  and then he went on to take part in this campaign involving prominent athletes that he filmed them.
*16:57.940- 17:05.020* :  He has also told me that he was central to getting a major ice hockey tournament relocated.
*17:05.020- 17:08.520* :  It should have been in Belarus, he got it moved to another country, and that would have
*17:09.060- 17:14.040* :  he is sure, angered Alexander Lukashenko, who is a massive ice hockey fan, and who wanted
*17:14.040- 17:19.200* :  this prestigious event. The initial request to arrest Mr Gignot came from Interpol, the
*17:19.200- 17:25.680* :  international police organization, but they've now dropped it. Why is Serbia apparently considering
*17:25.680- 17:31.140* :  extraditing him to Belarus, given that most European countries have criticized Alexander
*17:31.140- 17:35.520* :  Lukashenko's regime and its record of locking up political dissidents?
*17:35.960- 17:40.200* :  I think that's a very big and open question, and it's exactly what the lawyers,
*17:40.200- 17:45.680* :  Mr Gignot, have been pointing out and have been fighting. I mean, on paper, the reason is that
*17:45.680- 17:52.840* :  Serbia and Belarus have an extradition agreement, and so on paper Serbia is continuing with a process,
*17:53.360- 17:58.340* :  a normal legal process, as far as it's concerned. Once Mr Gignot was arrested, they continued with
*17:58.340- 18:02.820* :  the consideration of the request from Belarus to extradite him. But of course, they're coming
*18:02.820- 18:07.900* :  under huge pressure. There's been pressure not just from the lawyers, but also from dozens of
*18:07.900- 18:13.500* :  European filmmakers and artists, including Nobel laureates, who issued an open letter, signed an
*18:13.500- 18:19.400* :  open letter just on the eve of this final court hearing, urging the Serbian authorities not
*18:19.400- 18:25.700* :  to extradite Mr Gignot and pointing out that he has very real concerns that in prison, in Belarus,
*18:25.700- 18:30.680* :  he would face torture, and he's concerned, he's told me that he would also face potentially the
*18:30.680- 18:37.600* :  death penalty for some of his political activism. You don't think that the idea he's wanted for
*18:37.600- 18:43.360* :  tax evasion stands up at all. The amount of money that's being talked about is some 300,000
*18:43.360- 18:48.320* :  euros, and in his final statement, Andrei Gignot pointed out that he would have to be making
*18:48.320- 18:53.060* :  millions in order to owe that much in backtax, and he said that he wouldn't be flying around the
*18:53.060- 18:58.460* :  world, looking for little jobs in Serbia, if he was that rich, and if he was that much of a criminal,
*18:58.460- 19:03.340* :  he said he'd be in casinos, he wouldn't be in a prison in Serbia. So he's adamant that this is
*19:03.480- 19:07.860* :  political, and certainly I think we just need to remember the context, the fact that there are
*19:07.860- 19:13.100* :  hundreds of political prisoners still behind bars in Belarus, and that some of the most prominent
*19:13.100- 19:19.820* :  names amongst them, including a Nobel laureate, Alice Bielutsky, he was also detained initially
*19:19.820- 19:25.580* :  for tax evasion before a number of other charges were pressed against him. So it is normal practice
*19:25.580- 19:30.340* :  for Belarus, which does go after political opponents of Alexander Lukashenko.
*19:30.920- 19:36.400* :  Our East Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford, even by the standards of Jihadi violence,
*19:36.400- 19:40.840* :  the atrocity which took place in Bikina Faso over the weekend was particularly shocking.
*19:41.460- 19:45.740* :  Residents in the town of Barcelona had been warned that an attack might be on the way,
*19:46.340- 19:50.980* :  and were ordered to dig trenches for protection. It looks like the attack came while they were doing
*19:50.980- 19:56.540* :  so photographs from the scene show bodies scattered everywhere. Many of them still with shovels
*19:56.540- 20:00.680* :  in their hands. At least two hundred people are thought to have been killed, and the West
*20:00.680- 20:05.980* :  African nation is now rated as one of the worst in the world for Islamist violence. I spoke to
*20:05.980- 20:12.080* :  Africa regional editor Will Ross and asked him why? It's just been getting worse and worse now
*20:12.080- 20:20.380* :  for pretty much a decade. 2015 is when it kind of spread out of Marley and spread into Bikina Faso.
*20:20.640- 20:26.160* :  The authorities have used tactics which some people just think haven't worked at all.
*20:27.000- 20:31.380* :  Basically over the last few years they've decided to arm communities and have asked for
*20:31.380- 20:36.300* :  volunteers to come forward. They're given very limited amount of training and given a gun.
*20:36.820- 20:41.240* :  So what we've seen over the last few months are loads of attacks that seem to target these
*20:41.240- 20:48.360* :  volunteer forces, and it's not just JNIM. There's also Islamic State linked groups,
*20:49.160- 20:54.600* :  so you've got multiple groups moving highly mobile across these borders,
*20:55.540- 20:59.100* :  and at the same time there's been this sort of political upheaval going on
*20:59.800- 21:04.760* :  with the whole anti-French movement by the leaders in the Sahel countries,
*21:05.180- 21:11.280* :  booting out the French troops, in the case of Marley kicking out thousands of UN troops as well,
*21:12.240- 21:16.380* :  and in their place saying to Russia, come and help us out.
*21:16.660- 21:21.100* :  Yeah, I was going to ask about Russia because the group that was called the Valkyna Group now known
*21:21.100- 21:27.240* :  as the Africa Corps. They are active, supposedly in Bikina Faso. This incident suggests they're
*21:27.600- 21:31.560* :  a long way from managing to defeat the Jihadists they were supposed to be taking on.
*21:32.300- 21:37.960* :  Exactly. We don't get very clear ideas of exactly what they're up to, but I've seen some people
*21:37.960- 21:47.120* :  posting saying where were these Russian forces when Barcelona was attacked. We've seen in recent
*21:47.120- 21:55.720* :  months photos of Russian troops in Bikina Faso, a group called the Bear Brigade, who are a Russian
*21:55.720- 22:01.660* :  private military company, all really part of this Africa Corps, form of Valkyna Group, but we got
*22:01.660- 22:08.240* :  no real idea of the numbers involved and how engaged they really are in taking on the Jihadist
*22:08.240- 22:15.640* :  groups head on. In recent weeks we've had some heavy losses by Valkyna and by all the militaries
*22:15.640- 22:21.980* :  in these three countries, and considering they were seized by military men, saying the civilians
*22:21.980- 22:27.120* :  had failed to deal with the insecurity. It does at the moment, especially in Bikina Faso, it does
*22:27.120- 22:31.800* :  look as though things are getting to a kind of position where you're wondering really what the
*22:31.800- 22:36.840* :  future of the country is when nearly half of the country seems to be falling into the hands of
*22:36.840- 22:44.040* :  these Jihadist fighters. You're seeing the state slowly just being eaten away at and it's bound
*22:44.040- 22:49.060* :  to be growing frustration in the military with the number of deaths and it wouldn't be a surprise
*22:49.060- 22:55.100* :  if there were sort of more upheavals in the military. Will Ross, it's a population problem
*22:55.100- 23:00.280* :  suffered by many countries, but when your country has the world's biggest population, the problem
*23:00.280- 23:07.080* :  can be very big indeed. India will soon have 1.5 billion people, but at the same time,
*23:07.080- 23:12.000* :  Indians are now having fewer children, so that means a growing number of older people
*23:12.620- 23:17.960* :  supported by a relatively smaller number of working-age young people. Some in India however,
*23:17.960- 23:23.560* :  they're trying to see the over 60s, not as a burden, but an opportunity with companies hoping to
*23:23.560- 23:29.100* :  cash in on the so-called silver economy. The BBC's Arunadeh Makaji has this report.
*23:33.260- 23:39.520* :  In their 60s and on the road, this group of over a dozen old couples have traveled more than
*23:39.520- 23:45.420* :  a thousand kilometers away from their home in Maharashtra, in Western India. With one in,
*23:46.160- 23:54.900* :  checking things off their bucket lists. Travelling on a specially curated tour of a senior
*23:54.900- 24:04.520* :  citizens, the couples are visiting the city of Jeppo. Moving at a comfortable pace,
*24:04.540- 24:11.260* :  stopping for photographs, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. For many like Prakash
*24:11.320- 24:16.380* :  and Kreeti Parshikar, this is the first time they've had the chance to go on a trip like this.
*24:20.260- 24:24.960* :  These penta are entire-life working, caring for our children, giving them the best.
*24:25.760- 24:29.740* :  We didn't have time to travel. We also didn't have the money to do it as well before.
*24:30.140- 24:33.460* :  I felt we haven't seen most of India, so why not do it now?
*24:37.020- 24:43.140* :  It's this sentiment that travel companies like Vina World felt would be a lucrative market to tap into.
*24:43.480- 24:50.120* :  The company's founder, Sunila Patel says, this is a market segment that is time-rich and cash-rich.
*24:50.480- 24:55.140* :  They don't have to wait for a vacation to travel at any point. Like when you think of the
*24:55.140- 24:59.760* :  younger age group or the families, the first thing happens is when school starts as you take
*24:59.760- 25:03.340* :  the children's calendar and then you mark out when is it that you can travel.
*25:03.600- 25:08.660* :  A senior citizen's age group is such that you name it and they can travel.
*25:10.940- 25:13.540* :  It's what startup senior world has also been trying to do.
*25:14.880- 25:20.340* :  Rahul Gupta started the company 10 years ago, focusing primarily on helping senior citizens travel.
*25:21.300- 25:25.400* :  Its initial success has now made them full-ray into other verticals.
*25:27.840- 25:33.800* :  Like making and selling special mobile phones for seniors, devices that can be remote operated
*25:33.800- 25:39.400* :  by their children from anywhere around the world. Rahul also shows me an app his team has developed,
*25:39.860- 25:44.820* :  helping the elderly connect with each other, find common hobbies and join communities.
*25:45.960- 25:49.080* :  Rahul tells me why he's betting faith on this segment.
*25:50.340- 25:56.420* :  It has now come to a stage where it's getting attractive, the size is big, there are micro markets
*25:56.420- 26:02.680* :  emerging which are monetizable and it creates a huge opportunity. It is a blue ocean, virtually nobody
*26:02.680- 26:07.460* :  is focused on this segment, especially in a country like India where there are far more youngsters,
*26:08.140- 26:13.540* :  it's easier to target. So we think it makes for a compelling business opportunity both from a
*26:13.540- 26:17.640* :  social standpoint in terms of impact as well as from a financial standpoint going forward.
*26:18.100- 26:22.480* :  But not everyone can afford the services of companies like Vina World or Senior World.
*26:23.000- 26:28.520* :  In most Indian cities and towns, you'll also see the more disadvantaged elderly population.
*26:29.600- 26:34.500* :  According to the UN, 40% of the elderly in India fall among the poorest of the poor,
*26:34.980- 26:36.900* :  while one-fifth have no income at all.
*26:38.200- 26:43.120* :  While the government has some policies that give subsidized healthcare and aid to the elderly,
*26:43.720- 26:49.780* :  welfare services for them are still largely relegated to the private sector and hence not free.
*26:50.540- 26:53.800* :  And many of this traveling group acknowledge that privilege.
*26:57.940- 27:02.140* :  And as this batch of seniors dances to Bollywood hits at the end of their tour,
*27:03.060- 27:06.540* :  can India keep pace with the needs of its aging population?
*27:11.280- 27:13.560* :  That report was by Arunade Mukjee.
*27:14.160- 27:18.580* :  Today, it sees the opening ceremony for the Paralympics in the French capital, Paris.
*27:18.860- 27:23.880* :  There is of course huge pressure on all the athletes taking part, keen to be carrying a
*27:23.880- 27:28.080* :  medal back in their return luggage and bring some pride to their home country.
*27:28.860- 27:33.540* :  But one nation's Paralympic squad are perhaps under particular pressure to raise the
*27:33.540- 27:38.300* :  spirits of their fellow citizens. Ukraine is sending more than 70 competitors to the games.
*27:38.300- 27:45.140* :  Andy Swiss has been to meet some, including Danilo Chufferov, a 35-year-old visually impaired man
*27:45.460- 27:48.100* :  who survived the siege in the city of Maripol.
*27:52.380- 27:58.200* :  I was ready to die. I hoped I would survive, but the probability of dying was so high that you
*27:58.200- 28:03.420* :  just put up with it. How much did that period affect you both physically and mentally?
*28:05.440- 28:11.040* :  Of course, I lost a few kilos, but this does not reflect my mental state after I left the city.
*28:11.700- 28:14.220* :  I believe that this trauma will stay with me forever.
*28:16.220- 28:21.860* :  The last two and a half years have presented Ukraine's Paralympians with extraordinary challenges.
*28:24.460- 28:30.760* :  Ukraine's say 500 sport centres have been destroyed in the war, Chufferov now trains at this
*28:30.760- 28:37.280* :  pool near Deneepro, where sessions are interrupted by air raid sirens. And yet last summer he somehow
*28:37.280- 28:43.700* :  won three gold medals at the World Championships in Manchester. In fact, Ukraine are one of the most
*28:43.700- 28:51.800* :  successful Paralympic nations in the world. At the Winter Games in 2022, while protesting
*28:51.800- 29:00.780* :  against the invasion, they still finished second in the medals table, but the president of the
*29:00.780- 29:07.380* :  Ukrainian Paralympic Committee, Valerie Sushkavic, says preparing for this games has been even tougher.
*29:07.920- 29:12.440* :  It's terrible preparation. It's so, so, so, so difficult. It's terrible,
*29:12.440- 29:19.680* :  psychology, mentality and physical dangerous from their bombs every day.
*29:20.160- 29:22.220* :  Many athletes have had to move abroad.
*29:25.100- 29:29.600* :  Fensa Andrei Demchuk went to Poland where he's been training with their team,
*29:30.160- 29:35.680* :  but Demchuk, who's a leg amputee, has gone back to Ukraine where he speaks to injured soldiers
*29:35.680- 29:43.200* :  about adapting to life with a prosthetic. He's even delivered jeeps to help the war effort,
*29:43.580- 29:47.440* :  driving them he told me, with a bit of help from his fencing sword.
*29:47.560- 29:54.960* :  I have only one normal leg and three pedals, and for me I can help with a broken
*29:54.960- 30:05.560* :  epi or foil and push the clutch, and after I can push my left leg to another two pedals and
*30:05.760- 30:09.840* :  this is a little problem. At the forthcoming Paralympics,
*30:09.840- 30:15.500* :  some Russian athletes are able to compete as neutrals, just as they did at the Olympics earlier
*30:15.500- 30:21.380* :  in the summer. At the Olympics, though, just 15 Russian athletes took part, while at the Paralympics
*30:21.380- 30:29.020* :  90 have been entered to compete. For Ukrainian swimmer Anna Haunter, who had to move to Finland after
*30:29.020- 30:37.020* :  the invasion, facing them will not be easy. I will be trying to close my emotion, but I don't know
*30:37.020- 30:43.840* :  how it's going to be. I want to be in, I want to fight for Ukrainian, for my family, and I want to fight.
*30:44.760- 30:50.840* :  Anna Haunter ending that report by Andy Swiss. Now, stand back Willy Wonka, take a backseat
*30:50.840- 30:57.420* :  cabri's Nestle Hershey's and all the other major producers of chocolate. There is it seems a new way
*30:57.420- 31:02.620* :  of making the world's favourite indulgence, one that could turn it into a far healthier item of
*31:02.620- 31:09.120* :  confectionery and help farmers of the all-important cocoa bean. The idea is not just to use the cocoa
*31:09.120- 31:15.100* :  beans for making chocolate, but also the fruit or cocoa pod that comes with them. That would mean
*31:15.100- 31:20.940* :  you don't have to add sugar anymore and it reduces waste. It was obviously a tough assignment
*31:20.940- 31:26.360* :  against someone to report on this, but fortunately, imagine folks in Switzerland agreed to do it.
*31:29.680- 31:36.060* :  I've come to Choco-Sweets, the Association of Swiss Chocolate Makers, to talk to its director,
*31:36.060- 31:42.220* :  Roger Verly. I think they're very interesting proposals to use to hold cocoa fruit,
*31:43.100- 31:49.180* :  and then you even don't need any sugar anymore. If you use the whole cocoa fruit, I think you
*31:49.180- 31:55.500* :  can get better prices because you don't waste part of the fruit. Make chocolate without sugar
*31:55.500- 32:02.880* :  surely not possible. In fact, back in their laboratory, Caymananian are doing just that,
*32:03.420- 32:07.660* :  using first the juice of the cocoa fruit. Do you want to try some of this? Maybe the easiest
*32:07.660- 32:15.620* :  like to start with the juice. So this is the juice of the cocoa fruit. Exactly. Actually, that's
*32:15.620- 32:24.680* :  really nice. I've been like pineapple, maybe not quite as acidic. The juice has like 40% sugar.
*32:24.940- 32:30.720* :  The juice is then concentrated down to a thick syrup. Yeah, I think you could compare it to maple
*32:32.000- 32:36.520* :  syrup. Yeah. This you could put on your toast. Yeah. This is very sweet.
*32:37.460- 32:44.240* :  And making sure nothing goes unused, the husk or endocarp is used as a thickening agent.
*32:44.580- 32:50.280* :  So the endocarp is not sweet at all, and that's why it's typically left on the field,
*32:51.140- 32:59.560* :  basically fertilizer or compost, which is set, and that is why we thought maybe we can turn
*32:59.560- 33:03.760* :  this into a powder and use this powder, which is rich in pectins.
*33:04.500- 33:09.760* :  Without the endocarp, the chocolate would not solidify. The process is cesanian
*33:09.760- 33:16.420* :  a win-win for cocoa farmers and chocolate producers. You use more of what is already there,
*33:16.440- 33:21.020* :  right? So instead of like fighting over who gets how much of the cake, you make the cake
*33:21.020- 33:26.220* :  louder and make everybody benefit. The farmers get significantly extra income through utilizing
*33:26.220- 33:31.280* :  cocoa powder, but also that the important industrial processing is happening in a country of origin,
*33:31.380- 33:35.160* :  creating jobs, creating value that can be distributed in a country of origin.
*33:37.040- 33:41.380* :  It all sounds amazing. So why haven't we always made chocolate like this?
*33:42.160- 33:48.160* :  As the old saying goes, the proof of the pudding or chocolate in this case is in the eating.
*33:48.740- 33:53.620* :  All right, so I suggest we start with this one, and I like to put it in my mouth,
*33:53.620- 34:03.600* :  and I don't swallow it. To me, it tastes like dark chocolate. I mean, I'm a fan of dark chocolate.
*34:04.400- 34:08.700* :  It's not a sweet. That report by Imogen folks in Switzerland.
*34:11.940- 34:16.220* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the Global News Podcast later.
*34:16.220- 34:21.140* :  But just before we go, we're planning a special program in Montreal, Canada next month
*34:21.140- 34:26.440* :  at the One Young World Summit, where young people from across the world gather to share their
*34:26.440- 34:31.920* :  solutions to global issues. And for that, we'd like to know what questions you would put to a group
*34:31.920- 34:37.140* :  of young people setting out to change the world. It could be about the environment, world peace,
*34:37.140- 34:46.040* :  AI or any other issue. You can send us an email at globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us
