*01:34.860- 01:39.220* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 20th of August, these are our main
*01:39.220- 01:44.920* :  stories. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in Chicago, where Kamala Harris
*01:44.920- 01:49.140* :  is set to be formally confirmed this week as the Democratic presidential candidate.
*01:49.740- 01:55.380* :  The US Secretary of State says Israel has accepted what he called an American bridging proposal
*01:55.380- 02:02.280* :  for a ceasefire deal in Gaza, and it's now up to Hamas to agree to it. And President Zelensky says his
*02:02.280- 02:07.360* :  troops have now taken control of over 1200 square kilometers of Russian territory.
*02:07.740- 02:11.420* :  Also, in this podcast.
*02:20.840- 02:26.500* :  The pioneer in US television talk show host Phil Donahue has died at the age of 88.
*02:32.000- 02:34.400* :  And we begin in the US city of Chicago.
*02:37.340- 02:38.740* :  How are you here?
*02:38.740- 02:41.080* :  You're so important. Genocide.
*02:43.880- 02:49.340* :  Pro-Palestinian protesters marched on Monday to the venue of the Democratic National Convention.
*02:49.420- 02:55.420* :  The four-day event will see Kamala Harris formally confirmed as the party's presidential candidate.
*02:56.120- 03:01.060* :  But there are concerns that divisions over the war in Gaza could undermine party unity.
*03:01.900- 03:07.420* :  Ms. Harris is expected to join President Biden on stage when he will deliver the keynote
*03:07.420- 03:12.420* :  address of the convention's opening night. At a media briefing ahead of the convention,
*03:12.420- 03:19.000* :  the Democratic senator Chris Coons said Kamala Harris was the perfect choice to succeed Joe Biden.
*03:19.560- 03:24.080* :  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have fought tirelessly for the American middle class to reduce costs.
*03:24.660- 03:28.980* :  And his trusted vice president Kamala Harris is the right person to carry forward that fight,
*03:29.380- 03:33.000* :  and this week is about celebrating what it means to be for the people.
*03:33.660- 03:37.240* :  Such large gatherings are a time to show off party unity.
*03:37.240- 03:41.980* :  But there are concerns that divisions over the war in Gaza could undermine it.
*03:42.300- 03:44.840* :  Protests are planned for every day of the convention.
*03:45.460- 03:50.160* :  Carrying Palestinian flags, hundreds marched towards a rally at Union Park.
*03:51.000- 03:56.280* :  It's a bitter shame that we consider ourselves that a nation of freedom of the world and
*03:56.280- 03:59.440* :  the liberators of the world when we're the ones supporting this genocide. It's so sad.
*03:59.800- 04:06.680* :  Our tax dollars are being used to kill children, women, elderly, millions of destroyed homes,
*04:06.680- 04:11.700* :  enough as enough. We heard more from our correspondent Emma Vardy who's in Chicago.
*04:12.440- 04:15.140* :  So the first day of the convention is all about Joe Biden.
*04:15.580- 04:20.900* :  It is. It's very symbolic, really. This is where he sort of hands the torch over to Kamala Harris.
*04:20.900- 04:25.140* :  But things have happened so quickly. It's less than a month since Joe Biden pulled out.
*04:26.100- 04:28.840* :  And this then Kamala Harris became the nominee.
*04:29.360- 04:33.420* :  Of course, Joe Biden will be appearing tonight. It's something he thought he was going to be here
*04:33.420- 04:38.280* :  being the Democrats nominee to fight for a second term. What he's going to have to do is
*04:38.320- 04:42.840* :  perhaps talk about some of his own accomplishments, but his focus is going to have to be arguing
*04:43.380- 04:46.200* :  why he believes Kamala Harris must beat Donald Trump.
*04:46.740- 04:52.260* :  He's Democrats will want to see Joe Biden rallying behind her and helping to make the case
*04:52.300- 04:55.900* :  against Donald Trump. Of course, we've heard Joe Biden say many times he believes
*04:55.900- 05:01.000* :  Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, so expect to hear a bit more of that tonight.
*05:01.000- 05:05.940* :  But this is all part of trying to keep that feel-good momentum going for Kamala Harris,
*05:05.940- 05:11.080* :  because since Joe Biden pulled out and she became the Democrats nominee, the party's seen
*05:11.080- 05:17.460* :  a real reversal in the polls. Polls now suggesting that Democrats had been behind Donald Trump
*05:17.460- 05:21.560* :  leading up to this, but now they appear to have overtaken them in the polls.
*05:21.980- 05:26.920* :  And now Kamala Harris appears to be beating Donald Trump in some of the key swing states.
*05:27.080- 05:31.220* :  So people will be watching that very closely too, and they'll be hoping that the convention
*05:31.220- 05:37.420* :  provides another big moment to drum up even more support for Kamala Harris. So people are really
*05:37.420- 05:41.500* :  only just getting to know because she has been thrust into this position so fast.
*05:41.780- 05:47.980* :  Now, conventions are generally a time to show off party unity, but we have heard from pro-Palestinian
*05:48.360- 05:53.520* :  protesters who are making their voices heard just how united is the party.
*05:53.980- 05:58.520* :  Well, the war in Gaza and the war between Gaza and Israel is certainly perhaps the most
*05:58.520- 06:03.220* :  difficult issue for Kamala Harris. It's been a difficult issue for the Democrats because a lot
*06:03.220- 06:08.920* :  of natural Democratic voters, a lot of younger voters who would have naturally supported Democrats,
*06:08.920- 06:14.700* :  perhaps in fact have been really angry with Joe Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.
*06:15.120- 06:20.900* :  And there's lots of people demonstrating here, arguing that Washington should pull back its
*06:20.900- 06:26.720* :  support for Israel. So Kamala Harris has this opportunity to try to draw some sort of nuance
*06:26.720- 06:32.000* :  between her position and Joe Biden's that might help placate some voters who are angry about
*06:32.000- 06:37.440* :  Joe Biden's handling of the war in Gaza. But broadly, we know she supports his position.
*06:37.520- 06:42.120* :  There's not a lot she can do to break away from that. It is perhaps the most difficult issue
*06:42.120- 06:46.460* :  for Democrats at the moment of the protests out here outside here, just I put even more of a
*06:46.460- 06:52.740* :  focus on that. That was Emma Vardi in Chicago. Well, President Biden's address is the big event
*06:52.740- 06:59.180* :  at the convention. In essence, it is farewell to the Democratic Party. Chris Whipple is the author
*06:59.180- 07:05.900* :  of the Biden biography, the fight of his life inside Joe Biden's White House. He's in Chicago
*07:05.900- 07:11.260* :  for the Democratic National Convention. Paul Henley began by asking him, what does he make
*07:11.260- 07:16.620* :  of the position? But if people's revulsion that what's happening in Gaza stops them turning out
*07:16.620- 07:22.880* :  to vote, it's on this US government. If that should take place, then yes, indeed it would
*07:23.220- 07:31.000* :  presumably be on Kamala Harris and Biden and their failure to really address that issue.
*07:32.000- 07:39.000* :  I don't think it's going to be such a big factor. You know, this is not 1968. There's a palpable
*07:39.000- 07:45.100* :  excitement here in Chicago, tremendous security I can tell you. But I think that barring some really
*07:45.100- 07:54.780* :  unexpectedly disruptive protests against Gaza, I think mostly nothing but upside for Joe Biden
*07:54.780- 08:00.160* :  tonight. I think he's going to bask in the adulation of his party. Lyndon Johnson couldn't come
*08:00.160- 08:07.480* :  anywhere near Chicago in 1968 and desperately wanted to. But Biden really will be celebrated tonight.
*08:07.480- 08:14.180* :  I think for an impressive record as a one-term president. And he's going to have a chance to
*08:14.920- 08:20.520* :  brag about all of the considerable achievements of his first term. Then he needs, of course,
*08:20.520- 08:28.020* :  to tee up Kamala Harris as the perfect person to carry the torch from here and to help to finish
*08:28.020- 08:34.320* :  the job as he likes to put it. He'll delineate what he sees as the existential stakes of this
*08:34.320- 08:40.620* :  election and the danger that Donald Trump represents. And I think if he can do all that with a
*08:40.620- 08:44.460* :  sense of humor, I think it's going to be a great night for Joe Biden.
*08:44.700- 08:48.420* :  Your book's called The Fight of His Life. Why do you think that his time in the White House
*08:48.940- 08:54.660* :  has been such a struggle? Well, you know, you can look at Joe Biden's entire life as a kind of a
*08:54.780- 09:03.440* :  fight, a fight against adversity and bad luck. And he certainly had a long and tumultuous career,
*09:04.140- 09:11.220* :  often defied the odds and came back. Nobody thought he would be elected in 2020 after the Iowa
*09:11.220- 09:17.640* :  caucus and the New Hampshire primary. But he defied all the skeptics and won the presidency.
*09:18.240- 09:25.780* :  He ultimately lost his last battle, which was to stay in office and stay on the ticket.
*09:26.760- 09:31.020* :  And I think that was a bitter pill for Joe Biden to swallow.
*09:31.660- 09:37.680* :  Chris Whipple, the author of The Biden Biography, The Fight of His Life, inside Joe Biden's White House.
*09:38.600- 09:43.180* :  The U.S. Secretary of State says it's up to Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza,
*09:43.620- 09:49.080* :  now that Israel has approved a proposal aimed at bridging the divide between the two sides.
*09:49.640- 09:52.160* :  Anthony Blinken was speaking after talks in Tel Aviv.
*09:52.520- 09:57.940* :  Israel accepts the bridging proposal. It's now incumbent on Hamas to do the same.
*09:58.660- 10:04.920* :  And then the parties with the help of the mediators have to come together and complete the process
*10:04.920- 10:08.420* :  of reaching clear understandings about how they'll implement the commitments.
*10:09.120- 10:14.160* :  Gill Dickman's cousin is still being held by Hamas, following the October 7th attacks.
*10:14.160- 10:20.780* :  He told the BBC that Israel must accept a deal soon, and it's the only way to stop the bloodshed.
*10:21.400- 10:25.720* :  I think most of the Israelis are actually supporting your deal right now.
*10:25.720- 10:30.460* :  And I really hope that this negotiation is not only going to succeed,
*10:31.040- 10:35.020* :  but that it's going to happen quickly because time is of the essence.
*10:35.060- 10:38.420* :  And we're not going to lose hope. We're not going to give up.
*10:38.420- 10:42.680* :  We must make sure that this chance is seized right now.
*10:43.220- 10:45.840* :  And that's a view shared by at least some of the people in Gaza.
*10:48.120- 10:53.300* :  First, we appeal to the mediators to exert more pressure on both sides in order to put an end to
*10:53.300- 10:58.340* :  this war. We're really tired and we no longer have the energy to bear more homelessness,
*10:58.340- 11:04.420* :  killing and destruction. We can't bear this suffering. We also want to tell both sides whether
*11:04.420- 11:08.420* :  it's Hamas or Israel that enough is enough. Our correspondent,
*11:08.420- 11:14.680* :  we're a Davis, is in Jerusalem. So Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted a U.S. proposal to bridge gaps
*11:14.680- 11:20.140* :  between Israel and Hamas. So what does that mean? The first thing it means is it puts a ball firmly
*11:20.140- 11:26.320* :  in Hamas. This doesn't mean that we're agreeing a peace deal. This doesn't mean the hostages
*11:26.320- 11:31.520* :  are going to be released anytime soon. But it means that Mr Netanyahu has agreed to the next stage
*11:31.520- 11:37.520* :  forward. And that is a complicated framework, which would ultimately, hopefully, lead to a
*11:37.520- 11:42.180* :  peace deal. And after this two and a half, three hour meeting, Mr Netanyahu has apparently
*11:42.180- 11:46.340* :  agreed to these American bridging proposals. But there are sticking points and there are key
*11:46.340- 11:51.680* :  sticking points. What level of Israeli military presence would remain in Gaza, particularly in
*11:51.680- 11:56.480* :  southern Gaza and the event of a deal? What a freedom of movement would there be for Palestinians
*11:56.480- 12:02.760* :  within Gaza to return to their home areas in the event of a deal? And what Palestinian
*12:02.760- 12:07.560* :  prisoners would be released in exchange for the Israeli hostages? Those haven't been dealt with
*12:07.560- 12:13.200* :  yet. But the Israelis appear to have agreed to move forward to the next stage. They've long accused
*12:13.220- 12:19.920* :  Hamas of not wanting to do that, of putting obstacles in the way of a peace deal. Certainly,
*12:19.920- 12:26.620* :  Hamas is new leadership, which is based in Gaza, Yaya Sinwa, has expressed his opposition so far
*12:26.620- 12:33.000* :  to what was proposed last week in Qatar. But it appears that this American pressure on all sides,
*12:33.000- 12:38.780* :  you know, it's almost the last chance Saloon, according to Secretary Blinken, the
*12:38.780- 12:43.560* :  Disappear to have been some progress on the Israeli side. But Mr Blinken suggested that it was now
*12:43.560- 12:49.720* :  up to Hamas to agree to move on to the next stage as well. So what happens next? Mr Blinken
*12:49.720- 12:55.780* :  goes on to Northern Egypt. He'll then go to Qatar. And this is all part of this process of
*12:56.120- 13:01.020* :  achieving some sort of progress, no matter how small. And the reason for that, and again, Mr Blinken
*13:01.020- 13:05.840* :  has made that abundantly clear, is that he is worried that if there's no progress in the talks
*13:05.840- 13:12.800* :  between Israel and Hamas, that this much feared escalation into a regional conflict could certainly
*13:12.800- 13:18.500* :  happen. That's because, of course, Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate for assassinations,
*13:18.500- 13:24.500* :  presumably by Israel, of senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures on their territory in recent weeks.
*13:24.500- 13:28.880* :  And any sign of progress on the ground, according to the Americans and the Qataris and the Egyptians,
*13:28.880- 13:34.800* :  is good because it averts, hopefully, an escalation, a wide escalation of this conflict.
*13:35.500- 13:36.780* :  We're a Davis in Jerusalem.
*13:38.140- 13:43.500* :  President Bollady Mirzalensky of Ukraine has called on his allies to lift restrictions
*13:43.500- 13:50.160* :  on the use of long-range weapons to help strike deep into Russia. The request came on the same
*13:50.160- 13:57.320* :  day that Mr Zalensky said his forces were now in control of more than 1,250 square kilometers
*13:57.320- 14:03.760* :  of territory in Russia's Kursk region, including 92 settlements. It's been more than two weeks
*14:03.760- 14:10.460* :  since Ukraine launched its incursion. And as BBC Monitoring's Russian editor Vitaly Tevchenko
*14:10.460- 14:14.540* :  told us, he says he didn't tip his allies off in advance.
*14:14.680- 14:23.120* :  Well, the thing that struck me was that Mr Zalensky said that Ukraine had not told its Western
*14:23.120- 14:30.180* :  allies about the incursion into Russia's Kursk region. He said, and I quote, many people around
*14:30.180- 14:36.500* :  the world would have not believed it was possible, and it would have crossed the reddest line there is.
*14:36.500- 14:42.920* :  That's why no one knew about our preparations. To speak about his mood, he seemed to be upbeat.
*14:43.280- 14:49.820* :  And he said the world is shedding naive illusions. That's the phrase he used that Russia about how
*14:49.820- 14:58.440* :  Russia used its red lines, harmed Ukraine's defence. So this tells us something about the objectives
*14:59.220- 15:06.720* :  that the Kursk incursion seems to pursue. Mr Zalensky also wants allies to give Ukraine long-range
*15:06.720- 15:12.240* :  missiles to strike further into Russia. Are they likely to oblige? And how worried
*15:12.240- 15:18.840* :  will Mr Putin be? On the one hand, this is what Ukraine has been asking for for months, and
*15:18.840- 15:26.680* :  that permission has not been granted yet. On the other hand, the incursion into Russia's Kursk region
*15:26.680- 15:35.460* :  redefines many things. We've seen during this conflict that initially the West was reluctant to give
*15:35.460- 15:43.760* :  Ukraine tanks and missiles wherever they may be used, and then Ukraine got that and F-16 fighter jets.
*15:44.480- 15:50.260* :  So that's what Ukraine is hoping for, that by showing that even when Ukrainian forces are fighting
*15:50.260- 15:56.720* :  inside Russia, there's been no massive escalation by Russia. The message to the West is, don't be
*15:56.720- 16:02.160* :  afraid of an escalation by Russia. So Ukraine will be hoping that that permission to use sophisticated
*16:02.160- 16:08.060* :  long-range West missiles against targets in Russia will be granted. That was a vitality of
*16:08.080- 16:14.960* :  Chenko. So what impact is Ukraine's ongoing incursion having on the economy in Russia? Here's
*16:14.960- 16:19.860* :  our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. I think it's fair to say that in terms of everyday life here,
*16:19.860- 16:24.940* :  the war isn't affecting Russians as much as some had predicted it would, right, two and a half
*16:24.940- 16:29.500* :  years ago, when there was that wave of Western sanctions hitting Russia. So the Russian economy
*16:29.500- 16:34.880* :  did not collapse. Yes, some Western goods have disappeared from the shops a lot of Western stores
*16:34.880- 16:39.520* :  have shut, but the supermarkets here are still very well stocked. A lot of Chinese products now,
*16:39.520- 16:45.040* :  Chinese mobile phones, PCs and washing machines and microwave and Chinese cars instead of European ones.
*16:45.760- 16:51.100* :  Prices have jumped considerably, so inflation's a problem right now, but the economy as a whole is
*16:51.100- 16:57.100* :  growing. It's forecast to grow I think 3% this year, and that's being fueled by spending on the war.
*16:57.460- 17:01.920* :  So you've got factories working around the clock making missiles and ammunition serving that the
*17:01.920- 17:06.740* :  military industrial sector, this war economy, but that creates big problems down the road for Russia.
*17:06.740- 17:11.940* :  What happens when the war ends? It's there, of course, in the TV bulletins, in the newspapers,
*17:11.940- 17:17.760* :  but it's not always top story or front page news anymore. So for example, on the front page of
*17:17.880- 17:22.980* :  Russia's most popular tabloid today, there's a spy story and a story about fishing and the
*17:22.980- 17:26.640* :  Russian government paper today on its front page has a story about the Russian gas industry.
*17:27.060- 17:31.400* :  You can find articles about the war inside, but it's not staring you in the face, and I think
*17:31.400- 17:35.920* :  it's a conscious decision by the authorities not to panic Russians, but to get them used to the
*17:35.920- 17:41.020* :  fact that this so-called special military operation is going on in the background, it's now routine.
*17:41.560- 17:45.320* :  But then suddenly you have this astonishing development, right? The Ukrainian incursion,
*17:45.720- 17:50.780* :  which is far from routine, which is causing unease and alarm in Russian society and doesn't
*17:50.780- 17:54.680* :  feel at all the pattern of routineization. That was Steve Rosenberg.
*17:55.740- 17:59.300* :  In the early hours of Monday morning, during an intense storm,
*17:59.300- 18:05.460* :  a phenomenon known as a water spout overwhelmed a luxury yacht off the coast of the Italian
*18:05.460- 18:12.900* :  island of Sicily. 22 people were on board, one body has been recovered, and 15 survivors have
*18:12.900- 18:19.300* :  been found, including a baby saved from the waves by her mother. But six people are missing,
*18:19.300- 18:24.620* :  among them the British technology entrepreneur Mike Lynch. Mark Lohan reports.
*18:49.580- 18:57.200* :  15 of the 22 on board were rescued, others British, American, Canadian weren't so lucky.
*18:58.000- 19:03.060* :  Castan Borner, the captain of a boat that was nearby at the time, helped rescue some of the survivors.
*19:19.020- 19:24.400* :  We brought them to our ship. The wreckage of the Bayesian yacht is now 50 meters underwater on the
*19:24.400- 19:29.480* :  seabed, where the search operation is focused. We've watched as divers have returned to shore for
*19:29.480- 19:35.360* :  the night. A local fisherman Fabio Cefalou was already working when the storm hit and spoke of
*19:35.360- 19:43.180* :  what it left in its wake. We were down by the boat waiting for the sailors to go on a fishing trip.
*19:43.560- 19:48.280* :  I saw these flashes of lightning and I didn't like the sky, so we stopped inside the docks and
*19:48.280- 19:53.440* :  were waiting for the disturbance to pass. At around four or five o'clock it hit the town of
*19:53.440- 20:01.720* :  Porticello, the water spout. There was a lot of fear in the harbor. Among those missing is the
*20:01.720- 20:07.080* :  British tech multi-millionaire Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, his wife who was
*20:07.080- 20:12.040* :  rescued is listed as the yacht company's owner. Survivors have been taken to local hospitals.
*20:12.560- 20:17.700* :  One British woman told of holding her one-year-old baby who also survived above the water
*20:17.700- 20:22.560* :  with all her strength. All I could hear around me, she said, with the screams of others.
*20:23.460- 20:28.600* :  Mark Lohan. Well, Mike Lynch was recently acquitted of multi-billion dollar fraud
*20:28.600- 20:33.440* :  charges in the United States, related to the sale of his software company autonomy.
*20:34.280- 20:39.540* :  It's a story which the BBC has reported on extensively, both on the world service and our
*20:39.540- 20:46.380* :  domestic sister service Radio 4. Here's our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman. Mike Lynch has had a
*20:46.380- 20:52.220* :  roller coaster career. He was once described as Britain's Bill Gates and his software firm autonomy,
*20:52.680- 20:57.640* :  which claimed to be able to get data from phone calls and emails, was triumphantly sold to the US
*20:57.640- 21:03.340* :  tech giant Hewlett Packard for an at-the-time eye-watering $11 billion in 2011.
*21:04.220- 21:09.500* :  But a short while later, HP accused Mr Lynch and his team of falsely inflating the value of
*21:09.500- 21:15.920* :  the firm and wrote off nearly $9 billion of its investment. Years of legal action followed and he
*21:15.920- 21:22.120* :  was eventually extradited to the US to face 15 charges of fraud. In July, the Cambridge graduate
*21:22.120- 21:28.020* :  was dramatically acquitted after representing himself in court. He said he wanted to spend more time
*21:28.020- 21:33.320* :  with his family and get back to work. He was also reported to be in line for a $300 million
*21:33.320- 21:38.980* :  pound payout from the recent sale of the UK Cybersecurity Fund Dark Trace, which he co-founded.
*21:39.740- 21:44.840* :  At the beginning of August, Mr Lynch told Radio 4 that he believed being wealthy had helped him
*21:44.840- 21:48.400* :  navigate the legal system. The reason I'm sitting here, let's be honest,
*21:48.620- 21:53.020* :  is not only because, coming back to what I was saying, as alter-innocent and perhaps have had
*21:53.020- 21:57.580* :  experience of handling complex situation because of the way I do, but because I had enough money
*21:57.580- 22:02.060* :  to not be swept away by the process that set up to sweep you away.
*22:02.380- 22:06.520* :  His chief financial officer did serve a prison sentence following a separate trial.
*22:06.860- 22:11.920* :  The software tool autonomy developed used a statistical method known as Bayesian inference.
*22:11.920- 22:17.760* :  It's based on an 18th-century theory and helps forecasters predict outcomes more reliably.
*22:18.500- 22:24.120* :  It's still used in AI tools today. It's also the name of the luxury yacht where Mike Lynch was last
*22:24.120- 22:33.400* :  seen. So eat line man. Still to come? Long COVID, it's not just a single disease because the virus
*22:33.400- 22:38.020* :  itself affects pretty much all the organs of the body, the heart, the lungs, the immune system,
*22:38.020- 22:43.940* :  the brain, the kidneys. An alarming report in Australia on the economic impact of long COVID.

*23:56.200- 24:03.100* :  Since mass social protests erupted in Nicaragua in 2018, Daniel Ortega's government has
*24:03.100- 24:09.640* :  outlawed thousands of civic groups. Now in the latest move against non-governmental organisations,
*24:09.820- 24:16.400* :  a further 1,500 such groups have been shut down. Human rights organisations say the government
*24:16.400- 24:22.720* :  of Daniel Ortega banned the NGOs because it views them as hostile. America's regional editor
*24:22.720- 24:30.240* :  is Clizia Sala. These groups are accused of failing to report their finances, but what's special,
*24:30.240- 24:35.660* :  what's different about this announcement is that it was the single largest targeting of NGOs
*24:35.660- 24:43.560* :  to date, with say like 1,500 NGOs were basically outlawed. And I've taken a look at the list
*24:43.560- 24:50.180* :  published by the Nicaraguan government. It's religious groups, some Catholic, some evangelical,
*24:50.180- 24:58.620* :  but also like sports groups, business associations, all sorts of different groups. And they will all
*24:58.620- 25:04.460* :  face now confiscation of property too. We must say that Nicaragua has been cracking down on civil
*25:04.460- 25:10.180* :  and Catholic associations, as you were mentioning, since anti-government protests rocked the country
*25:10.180- 25:17.040* :  in 2018. Basically what happened there is that President Ortega labeled those demonstrations as
*25:17.040- 25:24.400* :  a coup attempt and claimed that opponents and some NGOs financed those demonstrations.
*25:24.400- 25:31.940* :  Since then, authorities have closed over 5,000 civil society groups and also private universities
*25:31.940- 25:38.040* :  and media outlets. And you mentioned obviously there's a swath of NGOs that are being
*25:38.040- 25:42.980* :  affected, but particularly religious groups. Tell us a little bit more about why that is the case.
*25:43.340- 25:50.720* :  Again, it all goes back to 2018 to those protests I was mentioning. So during those
*25:50.720- 25:57.700* :  protests, some Catholic leaders gave protesters shelter in their churches. And the church also
*25:57.700- 26:04.220* :  later tried to act as a mediator between the government and the political opposition. So
*26:05.000- 26:11.140* :  Ortega branded Catholic figures he saw as sympathetic to the opposition as terrorists,
*26:11.920- 26:19.240* :  who had backed efforts to overthrow him. And dozens of religion figures were arrested or fled
*26:19.240- 26:26.360* :  the country. Fast forward to 2023, the Vatican decided to close its embassy in Nicaragua and
*26:26.360- 26:32.620* :  dozens of priests were kicked out of the country. Ortega's wife, and who's also the vice president
*26:32.620- 26:39.760* :  Rosario Murillo, has also described these religious groups as children of the devil or agents of
*26:39.760- 26:47.260* :  the devil who carry out spiritual terrorism. Let's hear Sarah. Next to the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*26:47.740- 26:53.660* :  which hopes to receive its first doses of MPOX vaccine by next week. This comes days after
*26:53.660- 26:59.640* :  the global vaccine group Gavi said it had up to half a billion dollars to spend on getting
*26:59.640- 27:05.060* :  the shots to countries affected by the escalating outbreak. The government says there have been
*27:05.060- 27:12.420* :  more than 16,000 recorded cases of MPOX in the DRC this year, including over 500 deaths.
*27:13.080- 27:19.980* :  MPOX is transmitted through close contact, including sexual contact. It causes flu-like symptoms
*27:19.980- 27:26.840* :  and skin lesions. Will Ross reports? There are two recognized MPOX vaccines, but apart from
*27:26.840- 27:31.600* :  for clinical trials, they've not been available in Congo or elsewhere in the region where the disease
*27:31.600- 27:37.360* :  has long been endemic. That's about to change. Officials in the capital Kinshasa say the US has
*27:37.360- 27:43.500* :  promised 50,000 doses, and Japan has agreed to send 3.5 million. Health Minister Samuel
*27:43.500- 27:49.360* :  Roger Campbell is hopeful that the MPOX vaccination campaign can begin next week, mostly targeting
*27:49.360- 27:55.140* :  children. The infection rate amongst under 15-year-olds is high. There's another challenge though.
*27:55.140- 27:59.980* :  Some of the worst affected areas of Congo are also suffering from armed conflict.
*28:00.560- 28:06.060* :  Will Ross. Now in Monday's early podcast, we reported on the British government's plan
*28:06.060- 28:12.940* :  to treat misogyny prejudice or hatred against women as an extremist ideology. The UK's
*28:12.940- 28:18.620* :  Interior Minister or Home Secretary of Etc. said it was important to crack down on what she said
*28:18.620- 28:24.960* :  was a rise in hatred of women, both online and our streets. Surprising as it may seem,
*28:24.960- 28:31.360* :  the story has created a significant reaction in China, where thousands of people on social media
*28:31.360- 28:36.320* :  are calling for similar legislation. Our China media analyst is Carrie Allen.
*28:36.780- 28:41.620* :  So today, there are thousands of people talking on one of China's most popular social networks,
*28:41.620- 28:48.760* :  Weibo, about these plans that are set to come to the UK. And it is very clear looking at polls and
*28:48.760- 28:53.340* :  comments that people think that China should have similar laws. I mean, I've seen that there
*28:53.340- 28:58.820* :  was a poll today that was posted asking people, what do you think of this idea? And the majority,
*28:58.820- 29:05.520* :  I'm talking about 75-80% of people have said, yeah, they think it's a good idea. And some of the
*29:05.520- 29:10.720* :  comments I'm seeing on Weibo are, for example, when will China learn? I mean, that's just one of the
*29:10.720- 29:17.440* :  comments I've seen and it's had more than 2,000 likes. So why has this struck such a chord in China?
*29:17.440- 29:24.780* :  To what extent is misogyny an issue there? I would say the reason it's caused such a stir is
*29:24.780- 29:33.080* :  because women across China still feel very subservient in Chinese society. There's a feeling that
*29:33.300- 29:38.140* :  in the workplace, for example, they're not able to rise through the ranks. Also, I think one thing
*29:38.140- 29:43.540* :  that's very important to know is that only in 2015, so not that long ago, China introduced
*29:43.540- 29:50.800* :  domestic violence laws. And so violence against women was until very recently, actually very,
*29:50.800- 29:55.680* :  very common. In fact, to the extent that I've seen people, women being attacked on the streets.
*29:56.300- 30:01.060* :  And people just gather around and watch. They don't intervene. They judge it a private matter
*30:01.060- 30:05.720* :  between a couple. And statistics, I should mention, for domestic violence, they're estimated at one
*30:05.720- 30:11.220* :  in four women in China have experienced some form of violence. And it's thought that obviously with
*30:11.220- 30:17.180* :  COVID-19 lockdowns, that those statistics might have risen. And they say that's in person. There's
*30:17.180- 30:22.780* :  also violence online. There's really a feeling that women can't say much or do much without being
*30:22.780- 30:29.040* :  shot down by men. As you say, there has been a lot of interest and a lot of support for the idea
*30:29.040- 30:35.940* :  that China could adopt something like this. How likely is that? I think it's very, very unlikely.
*30:36.000- 30:41.900* :  I mean, one of the things that I've been seeing on Weibo today is people commenting that in
*30:42.460- 30:47.360* :  China, in Chinese government, men hold the power. There's a feeling that with the British
*30:47.360- 30:53.280* :  home secretary, Yvette Cooper, being a woman, that only when women hold power can they be treated
*30:53.280- 30:58.360* :  fairly. So, I mean, that's another comment I've seen on Weibo, people saying that, well, only when
*30:58.360- 31:04.900* :  China gets female politicians into positions of high power, can laws like this start to appear.
*31:05.640- 31:12.740* :  Carrie Allen. A report in Australia on the impact of long COVID says that about a quarter of
*31:12.740- 31:20.220* :  economic growth was wiped out in 2022. Long COVID causes a wide range of debilitating symptoms
*31:20.220- 31:27.480* :  that some people endure for months or even years. Rhino McIntyre is a professor of global biosecurity
*31:27.480- 31:33.700* :  at the University of New South Wales and senior author of the study. So, how did they reach these
*31:33.700- 31:41.140* :  figures? What we first did was estimate the amount of COVID infection in 2022 in Australia,
*31:41.940- 31:47.720* :  looking at serological surveys, which is tests in the blood in the population and we were able to
*31:47.720- 31:53.600* :  estimate each age group, what percentage had been infected by that stage. And then we took the
*31:53.600- 32:01.240* :  infection data and projected the incidence of long COVID based on published data on long COVID.
*32:02.120- 32:08.940* :  And then the disease data that we modeled were put into an economic model to estimate the
*32:09.240- 32:17.040* :  impact of that long COVID burden on economic losses. And that was based on people either being
*32:17.040- 32:24.720* :  not being able to work as a result of long COVID or working at a reduced capacity because of long
*32:25.840- 32:31.260* :  COVID. From a population health point of view, a small percentage can have a significant impact.
*32:31.260- 32:36.480* :  Think about coronary artery disease, which is the leading cause of death and illness in the world.
*32:37.000- 32:43.840* :  In Australia, for example, 2% of people have coronary artery disease. So, when we estimate long COVID
*32:44.540- 32:50.240* :  in the same order of magnitude, you know, sort of 2 to 3%, but some estimates are up to 20%.
*32:50.240- 32:56.460* :  You can see what a significant burden of disease it is. Long COVID, it's not just a single disease
*32:56.460- 33:01.580* :  because the virus itself affects pretty much all the organs of the body, the heart, the lungs,
*33:01.580- 33:06.660* :  the immune system, the brain, the kidneys, got the brain fog and the cognitive impairment,
*33:06.660- 33:12.560* :  which has been shown in multiple studies now. So, it's much more heterogeneous. And really,
*33:13.200- 33:19.700* :  prevention of COVID itself is the most impactful thing that could be done to reduce the burden of
*33:19.700- 33:26.920* :  long COVID. Professor Reiner McIntyre, Professor of Global Biosecurity at the University of New
*33:26.920- 33:33.800* :  South Wales. The pioneering American talk show host Phil Donahue has died at the age of 88.
*33:33.800- 33:41.260* :  He hosted more than 6,000 editions of the Phil Donahue show from 1967 until its last nationwide
*33:41.260- 33:45.940* :  broadcast in 1996. Ella Bicknell looks back at his life.
*33:47.880- 33:53.680* :  Thank you very much. Well, thank you. I am flattered. You may be seated.
*33:54.980- 34:01.340* :  Phil Donahue lit up American TV sets with his easy breezy presenting style for almost three decades.
*34:01.340- 34:07.900* :  His first broadcast in Dayton, Ohio in 1967. Donahue was the first presenter to interact with
*34:07.900- 34:13.260* :  a studio audience, letting them take the microphone to discuss the serious issues of the day.
*34:13.260- 34:20.540* :  Two societies, one black, one white, both separate and unequal. The issue that won't go away,
*34:20.540- 34:25.660* :  the issue is race. Coming up on this public television station.
*34:25.980- 34:29.920* :  At its peak, the Donahue show had an audience of eight million viewers,
*34:29.920- 34:35.680* :  watching him interview the likes of Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali, Elton John and Dolly Parton.
*34:36.140- 34:39.540* :  He was a trailblazer for daytime presenters like Oprah Winfrey,
*34:39.540- 34:44.060* :  who presented him with a Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the 20 Emmys to his name.
*34:44.380- 34:47.380* :  Personally, I want to thank you for opening the door so wide,
*34:47.420- 34:51.400* :  wide enough for me to walk through because had there not been a Phil Donahue,
*34:51.540- 34:54.780* :  I don't believe there could have been an Oprah. I personally thank you.
*34:57.360- 35:01.900* :  And in 2024, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Joe Biden.
*35:02.220- 35:05.900* :  Phil Donahue will be remembered as the king of daytime television,
*35:06.760- 35:12.200* :  especially by his huge female fan base. Perhaps Nora Efron's assessment in her 1983 novel
*35:12.200- 35:16.900* :  Heartburned Sons at Art Best. If Sigmund Freud had watched Phil Donahue, she wrote,
*35:17.440- 35:19.680* :  he would never have wondered what women want.
*35:26.000- 35:28.280* :  Elabick Null on the Life of Phil Donahue
*35:31.020- 35:34.760* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*35:34.760- 35:39.220* :  later. If you would like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it,
