*01:28.880- 01:32.240* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, and this edition is published in the early hours of Saturday
*01:32.240- 01:33.440* :  10th of August.
*01:33.440- 01:38.800* :  A passenger plane has crashed in Sao Paulo State in Brazil, killing all 61 people on board.
*01:39.480- 01:44.560* :  Russia sends reinforcements to the CUSC region, as it struggles to contain a cross-border
*01:44.560- 01:45.800* :  attack by Ukraine.
*01:46.560- 01:51.680* :  And prison guards at Iran's Evin prison are reported to have beaten female inmates for
*01:51.680- 01:54.320* :  protesting against an upsurge in executions.
*01:56.380- 01:57.320* :  Also in the podcast.
*01:57.320- 02:02.120* :  This would be the earliest known solar calendar by many thousands of years.
*02:02.660- 02:08.020* :  The stone carvings that show how people recorded time 13,000 years ago.
*02:12.520- 02:18.260* :  It is a terrible thing to witness a plane tumbling out of control before plunging into the
*02:18.320- 02:18.720* :  ground.
*02:19.100- 02:25.060* :  Footage from Brazil shows the moment that an aircraft carrying 61 people dropped out of
*02:25.060- 02:26.880* :  the sky, killing everyone on board.
*02:26.980- 02:31.980* :  The domestic flight went down just outside Sao Paulo, a few miles short of its destination.
*02:32.620- 02:35.640* :  Local resident Philippe Magalhase saw what happened.
*02:38.040- 02:42.060* :  When I heard the sound of the plane falling, I looked out of my window and saw the moment
*02:42.060- 02:44.360* :  it crashed, the way it fell to the ground.
*02:45.140- 02:49.540* :  I ran out of the house to where it had crashed and saw it had fallen to the house of a couple
*02:49.540- 02:50.440* :  of elderly people.
*02:51.000- 02:56.360* :  We knew them from church, and so terrified, and not knowing what to do, I jumped over
*02:56.360- 02:56.760* :  the wall.
*02:57.360- 03:01.640* :  I got more details from our South America correspondent Ioni Wells in Sao Paulo.
*03:02.220- 03:06.220* :  Well, as we heard a snippet of there, this was a really, really shocking incident.
*03:06.220- 03:12.980* :  You can see from videos shot by shocked residents, the moment that this plane was spiraling
*03:12.980- 03:17.360* :  out of the sky, seemingly completely out of control, before it landed on the ground
*03:17.360- 03:20.380* :  and crashed into a big cloud of black smoke and flames.
*03:20.540- 03:26.220* :  Now we know that all 57 passengers and four crew members who were on board were killed.
*03:26.840- 03:31.700* :  There were no residents in the surrounding area who had been reported injured or killed.
*03:31.840- 03:36.520* :  It did land in a kind of residential complex where one of the homes has reportedly been
*03:36.520- 03:40.580* :  damaged, but no injuries as a say or casualties on the ground.
*03:41.340- 03:45.000* :  It's still very unclear what exactly caused this flight.
*03:45.840- 03:48.820* :  Officials have said that the plane was in good operating condition.
*03:48.820- 03:54.160* :  It had all the valid certificates, its crew were also all licensed and had valid qualifications
*03:54.500- 03:54.840* :  as well.
*03:55.440- 03:59.980* :  The Brazilian Air Force, though, has said that the flight was normal until about 20 past
*03:59.980- 04:04.780* :  one in the afternoon local time, and then it lost contact with air traffic control a
*04:04.820- 04:05.520* :  minute later.
*04:06.100- 04:10.600* :  It also said that the plane didn't declare any kind of emergency before crashing, or
*04:11.120- 04:15.420* :  that it had been struggling with bad weather conditions, so there's still a lot of unknowns
*04:15.460- 04:20.040* :  about what exactly caused this, particularly, of course, for all the families and friends
*04:20.080- 04:21.300* :  of those victims this evening.
*04:21.860- 04:26.080* :  Yeah, the way it spins out of control suggests it may have lost power.
*04:26.080- 04:27.680* :  Have they found the black box?
*04:27.940- 04:29.540* :  Well, we're still waiting for sort of updates.
*04:29.540- 04:34.320* :  There is an investigation going on as we speak to try and establish the parts of the plane
*04:34.320- 04:37.420* :  and also updates about what may have happened to it.
*04:37.700- 04:42.020* :  There is a big sort of area of rubble that can be seen in some of this footage where
*04:42.020- 04:46.040* :  the plane has landed, which officials are now sort of investigating and looking through
*04:46.040- 04:50.340* :  not only to try and establish the parts of the plane to find out what happened, but
*04:50.340- 04:55.580* :  also, of course, to recover the bodies of those who have been tragically killed in this
*04:55.580- 04:56.440* :  terrific accident.
*04:56.740- 05:00.380* :  Yeah, we're also hearing that some people who were due to be on the flight missed it,
*05:00.380- 05:01.660* :  and so had a lucky escape.
*05:01.860- 05:03.540* :  Well, that certainly may be the case.
*05:03.540- 05:08.760* :  I haven't spoken to them myself, if that is the case, but I have seen some interviews
*05:08.760- 05:13.960* :  with people who have been speaking at the site, many in the surrounding area who also feel
*05:13.960- 05:19.340* :  lucky to be alive, because this certainly caused a huge amount of damage, flames, as I
*05:19.340- 05:22.120* :  say, on the site where this plane crashed.
*05:22.460- 05:27.300* :  We've seen, for example, an interview with one man who said that had he been in a slightly
*05:27.300- 05:30.980* :  different place just moments before and had he not been moved out the way that he could
*05:30.980- 05:33.000* :  well have been right where that plane had crashed.
*05:33.100- 05:36.200* :  I think lots of people are feeling particularly lucky to be alive.
*05:36.200- 05:41.980* :  There was one also very moving interview with a woman who, when asked whether she could
*05:41.980- 05:47.000* :  have ever imagined something like this happening in her town, said, actually, yes, because she
*05:47.000- 05:51.780* :  is always worried about things like this, given the fact that the town sits under a popular
*05:52.040- 05:52.900* :  flight route.
*05:53.400- 05:56.240* :  Now, having said that, this is completely unprecedented.
*05:57.200- 06:02.840* :  There hasn't been a plane crash so deadly in Brazil since 2007 when a town plane burst
*06:02.840- 06:05.540* :  into flames, which killed 199 people.
*06:05.540- 06:09.480* :  There are hundreds and hundreds of flights to go in and out of Sao Paulo International
*06:09.480- 06:13.040* :  Airport every day, most of which with absolutely no problems at all.
*06:13.040- 06:17.000* :  So I think there are lots of people absolutely in shock by what has happened and also the
*06:17.000- 06:22.600* :  way that it happened, just seeing this plane fall out of the sky like that with no apparent
*06:22.600- 06:27.120* :  control whatsoever is causing huge amounts of concern for everybody here this evening.
*06:27.580- 06:30.100* :  I only was talking to me from Sao Paulo in Brazil.
*06:31.120- 06:36.240* :  Days after the Russian military claimed to have halted a Ukrainian cross-border offensive,
*06:36.300- 06:38.980* :  fighting is still going on in the course region.
*06:39.160- 06:45.040* :  Forage from up to 35 kilometers inside Russia shows two abandoned Russian battle tanks and
*06:45.040- 06:46.960* :  a burnt out column of military vehicles.
*06:47.540- 06:52.860* :  The Kremlin initially said the incursion, which began on Tuesday, involved 1,000 Ukrainian
*06:53.040- 06:53.360* :  troops.
*06:53.920- 06:57.980* :  It later claimed that Ukraine had lost up to 945 of them.
*06:58.440- 07:01.800* :  However, Ukrainian forces do seem to be on the offensive still.
*07:02.140- 07:07.640* :  In a video posted online, soldiers claimed to be in control of a Gazprom office in the
*07:07.640- 07:10.460* :  Russian town of Suja, 10 kilometers from the border.
*07:11.080- 07:17.140* :  The most important part of the situation is that we have such a place to control.
*07:17.900- 07:23.360* :  Wishing you health from Suja, the town is under control of the 61st rifle brigade.
*07:23.360- 07:27.520* :  The soldier says, flanks by three other troops with a Ukrainian flag.
*07:28.300- 07:33.460* :  The U.N. nuclear agency meanwhile is warning both sides to exercise maximum restraint
*07:33.460- 07:37.420* :  as fighting draws closer to a nuclear power plant in Kursk.
*07:37.700- 07:43.520* :  The IAEA said there were reports of significant military activity near the facility and urged
*07:43.520- 07:46.000* :  the two nations to avoid a nuclear accident.
*07:46.940- 07:50.360* :  So how is Russia responding to this Ukrainian offensive?
*07:50.360- 07:53.640* :  A question for our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse.
*07:54.360- 07:58.660* :  Well, it's trying to throw its familiar military might at the situation.
*07:59.020- 08:03.800* :  You know, we've seen footage on Russian state TV of missile launches, armored vehicles,
*08:03.800- 08:07.560* :  tanks either by rail or road being sent in.
*08:07.620- 08:11.840* :  But as of now, it is doing little to slow this advancing.
*08:11.860- 08:17.040* :  We're talking about Ukrainian forces making it as far as 10 kilometers inside Russia.
*08:17.620- 08:23.240* :  And as you mentioned, you know, we've seen footage of a one damaged convoy that was struck by a missile.
*08:23.240- 08:25.320* :  So the Ukrainians aren't just taking territory.
*08:25.340- 08:28.820* :  They're frustrating the Russians' attempts to push them back.
*08:29.160- 08:34.660* :  I don't think we are going to see lofty ambitions on the Ukrainian side of trying to push further in.
*08:34.920- 08:38.060* :  I think we're going to see Ukraine try and create a buffer zone
*08:38.500- 08:42.800* :  for as long as possible along the border to both pressurize Russia and the way we're seeing,
*08:42.800- 08:47.080* :  but also in the hope that more troops are drawn to that area
*08:47.380- 08:50.320* :  and also in the hope of trying to reduce the number of airstrikes.
*08:50.540- 08:54.040* :  And how is Ukraine able to maintain this advance
*08:54.040- 08:58.220* :  given the imbalance of forces and weaponry between the two nations?
*08:58.780- 09:03.720* :  That is a question certainly being posed by the more skeptical military analysts online.
*09:03.720- 09:07.440* :  Ukraine is still seriously outnumbered by Russian forces.
*09:07.620- 09:11.440* :  It is why they continue to inch forward in the eastern Dignetsk region.
*09:12.000- 09:16.900* :  And yet the Ukrainian command has decided this is an operation worth carrying out.
*09:17.180- 09:20.480* :  And you would imagine there has been some kind of Western endorsement as well,
*09:20.480- 09:23.680* :  either through the sensitive issue of strikes inside Russia,
*09:24.220- 09:27.340* :  but also shed the sharing of intelligence because you would imagine
*09:27.340- 09:30.240* :  the Ukrainians wouldn't have gone completely freelance on this.
*09:30.720- 09:31.980* :  So this is a gamble.
*09:32.280- 09:37.920* :  This is a high stakes maneuver by Ukraine because to send in elite fighters
*09:38.280- 09:41.820* :  in this way inside Russia, they need a return for that.
*09:41.860- 09:46.260* :  They need some kind of operational collapse elsewhere on the front lines inside Ukraine
*09:46.260- 09:49.520* :  or some kind of sizable concession from Russia.
*09:49.980- 09:53.660* :  And at the moment, you're seeing Russia doing everything it can to try and take it back.
*09:54.320- 09:57.440* :  Meanwhile, the Ukrainians have even widened their attacks,
*09:57.440- 10:02.740* :  hitting an air-based deep inside Russia and launching an amphibious radar
*10:02.740- 10:06.180* :  to the south and occupied Ukraine on the Kinburn spit.
*10:06.800- 10:10.220* :  Yes, I mean, on the latter operation we've seen,
*10:10.220- 10:14.740* :  it seems like a resuming of amphibious assaults by Ukrainian forces
*10:14.740- 10:16.960* :  on the southern point of the Nipro river.
*10:17.240- 10:19.340* :  These can still be classified as probing attacks
*10:19.340- 10:23.520* :  because the east bank of the river is occupied the west as under Ukrainian control.
*10:23.520- 10:27.240* :  And at the moment, you know, Ukraine has tried to establish a foothold there before.
*10:27.800- 10:30.640* :  Again, the aim is to draw Russian personnel.
*10:30.640- 10:32.660* :  So this is certainly coordinated.
*10:33.320- 10:35.780* :  As for the Lepetsk air-based strike,
*10:35.880- 10:38.440* :  this is something Ukraine has wanted to do for a long time.
*10:38.440- 10:45.220* :  It is reportedly hidden air-based where hundreds says Kiev of glide bombs are thought to be stored
*10:45.220- 10:48.080* :  where there are fighter jets and Russian bombers as well.
*10:48.080- 10:51.800* :  And so with a large-scale drone strike, as reported overnight,
*10:51.800- 10:58.240* :  this could well hinder Moscow's attempts to either terrorize cities or strike military positions.
*10:58.360- 11:03.420* :  But that has not happened despite Ukraine launching strikes inside Russia.
*11:03.420- 11:08.600* :  Nevertheless, we look with interest to see whether this will be an extension of a Ukrainian strategy.
*11:09.260- 11:13.780* :  James at Waterhouse in Kiev, or despite being forced on the defensive in some areas,
*11:13.780- 11:16.840* :  Russia continued to fire missiles into Ukraine,
*11:16.840- 11:22.060* :  killing at least 14 people and wounding many more in a strike on a supermarket
*11:22.060- 11:25.740* :  in the eastern Ukrainian town of Constantinivka.
*11:26.120- 11:31.840* :  Anita Anand asked Kurt Volka, former U.S. representative for Ukraine negotiations,
*11:32.540- 11:34.380* :  just how dangerous is this escalation?
*11:35.080- 11:37.840* :  This is a deliberate political signal from Ukraine.
*11:37.840- 11:41.280* :  Of course, Russia has been occupying parts of Ukraine for 10 years
*11:41.280- 11:45.420* :  and engaging in ruthless attacks every day inside Ukrainian territory.
*11:46.380- 11:49.040* :  So this is a way of bringing the war home to Russia,
*11:49.040- 11:55.620* :  a little bit, letting them know that it's not cost-free, that it is indeed a war.
*11:55.960- 11:59.320* :  The Russian public needs to recognize that, that there are risks for Russia.
*11:59.880- 12:01.780* :  So I think this is a very important signal.
*12:02.300- 12:08.060* :  I don't believe that Ukraine has the capability to really take over Russia or defeat Russia in Russia.
*12:08.060- 12:12.960* :  But doing something like this as an incursion, I think sends an important signal.
*12:13.240- 12:18.300* :  An important signal to Russia, does it send an important signal also to the United States, for example,
*12:18.300- 12:22.880* :  that, look, we're going to push on regardless and look at what we can do with what we've got?
*12:23.500- 12:27.460* :  People keep thinking that Ukraine is not capable and eventually they're going to have to give up.
*12:27.460- 12:31.720* :  And this is showing that Ukrainian capabilities are more robust than people have assumed.
*12:32.440- 12:40.300* :  Conversely, does it not risk escalation if these Ukrainian troops have been using weapons from the West?
*12:40.900- 12:41.860* :  I don't think so.
*12:42.560- 12:47.320* :  Russia has been attacking Ukraine relentlessly for over two years now.
*12:47.320- 12:50.040* :  If they could have done more, they would have already done it.
*12:50.360- 12:52.920* :  So I don't really think there's much risk of escalation.
*12:52.920- 12:54.460* :  Russia's already escalated.
*12:54.640- 12:57.480* :  What lines would Russia then cross after that?
*12:57.480- 13:03.060* :  If you're talking about nuclear weapons, I don't think that that achieves anything in terms of Russia winning the war.
*13:03.600- 13:07.320* :  Any tactical use of nuclear weapons would not achieve a battlefield goal
*13:08.200- 13:12.320* :  and would draw an immediate response from from lots of quarters, not just from the West.
*13:12.780- 13:16.680* :  So I think that it very unlikely that they would turn to nuclear weapons.
*13:17.360- 13:22.440* :  If anything, I think it should cause Russia to begin thinking about how it wants to end this war.
*13:22.820- 13:24.280* :  It can't continue like this.
*13:24.560- 13:27.840* :  How do the next few weeks pan out then in your opinion?
*13:28.680- 13:31.880* :  Well, I think the Ukrainians are very keen to show gains on the battlefield.
*13:32.320- 13:38.620* :  They've gotten the bulk of the equipment that has been approved from that 61 billion dollars
*13:38.620- 13:40.260* :  that Congress had proved earlier this year.
*13:40.680- 13:42.600* :  That is making its way to the front lines.
*13:42.600- 13:45.880* :  So Ukraine is actually turning the tide a little bit.
*13:46.220- 13:49.160* :  And I think that's important for psychological reasons for everybody,
*13:49.700- 13:52.420* :  for the Ukrainians, for the Russians to see this happen,
*13:52.840- 13:56.140* :  and for the West to see that Ukraine is capable of doing that.
*13:56.300- 13:59.960* :  It's going to put them in a stronger position as we go into next year
*13:59.960- 14:04.240* :  and there may even be more pressure for some kind of negotiation or solution.
*14:04.460- 14:10.640* :  And you don't subscribe at all to the notion that a corner to President Putin is a more dangerous President Putin.
*14:11.020- 14:12.120* :  He's already dangerous.
*14:12.540- 14:16.000* :  So it's not as if doing that is going to make it worse.
*14:16.080- 14:17.220* :  He's already there.
*14:17.220- 14:22.240* :  We have to recognize that he has embarked on an imperialist and genocidal quest
*14:22.240- 14:25.380* :  to kill and eliminate a whole people
*14:25.920- 14:28.280* :  and to take over the territory of neighboring countries.
*14:28.700- 14:29.820* :  That's already bad enough.
*14:30.480- 14:34.260* :  Kurt Volka, the former US permanent representative to NATO.
*14:35.420- 14:40.880* :  Now, how did people thousands of years ago keep track of time and record important events?
*14:40.880- 14:45.780* :  Archaeologists believe they found what may be the world's oldest sun and moon calendar
*14:45.780- 14:50.240* :  at a site in southern Turkey, dating back nearly 13,000 years.
*14:50.960- 14:53.880* :  Symbols carved into pillars in the mountains of Anatolia
*14:53.880- 14:56.960* :  are also believed to have recorded a comet strike that hit the Earth.
*14:57.160- 15:00.200* :  Dr. Martin Sweatman from Edinburgh University told us more.
*15:00.940- 15:05.020* :  This site consists of lots of enclosures with lots of stone pillars.
*15:05.440- 15:09.620* :  And on one of these stone pillars, one of the most decorated stone pillars,
*15:09.620- 15:10.780* :  there are these carvings.
*15:11.080- 15:13.760* :  There is this, what we can interpret as a solar calendar.
*15:14.080- 15:16.820* :  And it's encoded in terms of these geometric symbols.
*15:16.820- 15:20.540* :  So we have these V symbols and there are some small box symbols.
*15:20.880- 15:24.600* :  And when we count them up, we can see that there is a lunar cycle.
*15:25.180- 15:28.380* :  And then when we add all these different lunar cycles up and all the extra days,
*15:28.380- 15:33.960* :  the extra V symbols, we can count an entire solar year of 365 days,
*15:34.400- 15:35.220* :  which is quite remarkable.
*15:36.220- 15:40.820* :  This would be the earliest known solar calendar by many thousands of years.
*15:41.660- 15:44.020* :  On the same pillar, there are lots of animal symbols.
*15:44.940- 15:47.820* :  There was this bird of prey symbol on the on the pillar,
*15:48.360- 15:50.640* :  which was representing the sun, the sun, the sun, this constellation.
*15:51.520- 15:53.580* :  One of the few things we know about that time period
*15:54.360- 15:58.620* :  is that this dramatic comet impact on Earth happened in its thought to have
*15:59.300- 16:05.120* :  triggered all sorts of effects, such as extinctions of animals and climate change
*16:05.120- 16:07.580* :  and so on. So it's the kind of thing that would have been
*16:07.580- 16:09.660* :  remembered by the people at the time.
*16:09.940- 16:12.780* :  And they probably built these constructions,
*16:13.340- 16:14.900* :  these pillars and these enclosures.
*16:15.800- 16:19.080* :  Because they were motivated by perhaps a new religion or a cult,
*16:19.860- 16:23.280* :  that was sort of triggered by this comet impact event.
*16:23.900- 16:25.820* :  You know, the building of these grand structures
*16:26.440- 16:29.380* :  would have encouraged people to gather around in the area,
*16:29.380- 16:31.320* :  to grow larger and larger communities.
*16:32.260- 16:34.200* :  So if our interpretation is correct,
*16:34.200- 16:38.440* :  it means that this comet impact might have had an important role
*16:39.060- 16:40.400* :  in the origin of civilization.
*16:44.440- 16:46.500* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast.
*16:47.020- 16:49.360* :  When I am convinced that my positions are true,
*16:50.000- 16:51.780* :  I'm ready to fight for beliefs.
*16:52.340- 16:56.820* :  The Israelis trying to protect Palestinian shepherds from Israeli settlers.

*17:34.520- 17:37.560* :  Did you know that it's 50 years this week since Richard Nixon
*17:37.560- 17:41.460* :  became the first US president in history to resign from office?

*17:57.980- 18:00.060* :  and from the man who was in the situation room,
*18:00.340- 18:02.100* :  during the raid on a summer bin Laden.
*18:02.580- 18:05.040* :  That's witness history from the BBC World Service.
*18:05.440- 18:08.240* :  Listen and subscribe wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:27.260- 18:30.860* :  Of Iranian Nobel laureates, Nagas Mahamedi,
*18:31.240- 18:34.300* :  say guards have severely beaten female inmates,
*18:34.300- 18:38.460* :  after they protested over an upsurge in executions in the country.
*18:38.460- 18:42.220* :  Human rights groups say at least 29 people were hanged this week,
*18:42.700- 18:47.160* :  including 26 in a group execution in one prison outside Tehran.
*18:47.620- 18:50.780* :  I got more details from Palm Gobadi of the BBC Persian Service.
*18:51.540- 18:55.780* :  Political prisoners, women, political prisoners in notorious Evan prison
*18:55.780- 19:01.340* :  decided that they would go on strike and show their protest every day
*19:01.340- 19:04.620* :  because of the number of executions in Iran.
*19:05.180- 19:07.620* :  And what happened was that they guards,
*19:08.040- 19:11.800* :  according to Nagas Mahamedi, they attacked female prisoners
*19:12.340- 19:15.520* :  and a male guard punched her in the chest
*19:15.680- 19:18.840* :  and she had a panic attack, she had difficulty breathing
*19:18.840- 19:20.960* :  but they refused to take her to the hospital.
*19:21.620- 19:23.640* :  And so few others were also injured.
*19:23.640- 19:27.780* :  But one of the main reasons is that a man who was actually arrested,
*19:27.780- 19:31.540* :  resorted, who was arrested during the protest two years ago in Iran
*19:31.540- 19:36.220* :  in the western city of Karmonsha, was executed three days ago.
*19:36.620- 19:39.940* :  And the way that he was executed actually shocked the nation
*19:39.960- 19:43.720* :  because BBC Persian understood that after midnight,
*19:43.720- 19:46.420* :  Iranian security forces go to his parents' place
*19:46.420- 19:52.100* :  and install cameras in front of their house at 4.30 pm at the dawn.
*19:52.100- 19:56.540* :  They hang him and at 6 o'clock in the morning, they notify the family.
*19:56.900- 19:58.660* :  And the reason why they installed the cameras
*19:58.660- 20:01.200* :  is that they want to check every movement of the family.
*20:01.200- 20:04.580* :  They want them not to hold, you know, invite a lot of people,
*20:04.580- 20:05.780* :  not to cause unrest.
*20:06.120- 20:08.460* :  This is a, you know, a pattern that they've been following
*20:08.460- 20:11.740* :  in the past two years for many other prisoners as well.
*20:12.000- 20:14.180* :  That was a political prisoner.
*20:14.860- 20:16.340* :  Many others were executed this week.
*20:16.340- 20:19.680* :  Why are we seeing so many people being put to death at the moment?
*20:20.120- 20:22.320* :  Most of the people believe that this is because
*20:22.320- 20:25.900* :  the Iranian regime after the protest, mass protests two years ago,
*20:25.900- 20:29.140* :  is scared that people might come to the streets again
*20:29.140- 20:31.880* :  because of the financial difficulties that they are facing.
*20:32.260- 20:34.060* :  So they use this as a form of, you know,
*20:34.520- 20:37.180* :  ruling with iron fist to make people scared.
*20:37.180- 20:40.180* :  It's a fear-mongering technique to send a signal
*20:40.180- 20:42.820* :  that if you dare to come out on the street again,
*20:43.320- 20:44.860* :  this is going to be the repercussion.
*20:45.260- 20:47.280* :  And this person who was executed, for example,
*20:48.300- 20:52.460* :  was accused of killing a security agent,
*20:52.460- 20:55.460* :  which he denied all the time during the past two years.
*20:55.740- 20:57.400* :  It's hard to keep track.
*20:57.400- 21:01.700* :  But by some accounts, 345 people executed this year,
*21:01.700- 21:05.740* :  including 87 since the relatively moderate president
*21:05.740- 21:06.820* :  was elected in July.
*21:07.300- 21:10.620* :  Yeah, but if you ask me, I bet if he has an interview
*21:10.620- 21:13.540* :  with any foreign media like his predecessors,
*21:13.540- 21:16.100* :  he's going to give you the exactly same answer
*21:16.440- 21:18.480* :  that Iran has an independent judiciary.
*21:19.080- 21:20.980* :  And I am not responsible for that.
*21:21.540- 21:25.380* :  But the reality is that most of the Iranian regime's critic
*21:25.380- 21:29.180* :  believe that Iranian judiciary is an extended arm
*21:29.420- 21:33.120* :  of Iran's security apparatus and intelligence apparatus.
*21:33.580- 21:35.660* :  Baham Kabadi of the BBC Persian Service.
*21:36.460- 21:40.800* :  The UN says more than 1,000 Palestinians have been forced from their homes
*21:40.820- 21:43.760* :  because of escalating violence by Israeli settlers
*21:43.760- 21:45.140* :  in the occupied territories.
*21:45.180- 21:48.480* :  The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice,
*21:49.000- 21:51.420* :  has ruled that the settlements in the Palestinian territories
*21:51.420- 21:52.180* :  are illegal.
*21:52.180- 21:55.820* :  Israel says they are part of the Jewish ancestral homeland
*21:55.820- 21:58.380* :  and necessary for Israel's security.
*21:58.380- 22:01.360* :  But some Israelis are braving settler intimidation
*22:01.360- 22:04.560* :  to stand in solidarity with Palestinian farmers.
*22:05.100- 22:07.040* :  Our special correspondent, Furgle Keen,
*22:07.040- 22:08.780* :  has this report from the Jordan Valley.
*22:13.060- 22:16.200* :  Keir is settler on horseback pushes against Gil Alexander,
*22:16.920- 22:19.180* :  a 71-year-old Jewish human rights activist
*22:19.700- 22:21.840* :  who's trying to stop him, scattering the flock
*22:21.840- 22:24.680* :  of Palestinian shepherd Ahmed Gharakman.
*22:24.680- 22:29.880* :  When I am convinced that my positions are true,
*22:30.560- 22:32.260* :  I'm ready to fight for my beliefs.
*22:33.480- 22:34.160* :  Call it stubborn.
*22:34.960- 22:35.660* :  Call it stubborn.
*22:35.760- 22:36.240* :  All right.
*22:37.920- 22:40.180* :  Gil describes himself as a Zionist.
*22:40.680- 22:43.120* :  He's a devout religious Jew who believes settlements
*22:43.680- 22:46.300* :  outside Israel's 1967 borders
*22:46.780- 22:48.620* :  should not have been forced on the Palestinians.
*22:49.500- 22:52.060* :  Gil, born in France where his father fought
*22:52.060- 22:53.800* :  on the resistance against the Nazis,
*22:53.800- 22:57.440* :  has been beaten and pepper sprayed, but he won't relent.
*22:59.080- 23:00.120* :  This is my philosophy.
*23:01.580- 23:04.960* :  We cannot be a country that lives at the expense of a population
*23:04.960- 23:06.640* :  that it governs both force.
*23:09.800- 23:13.160* :  Here, father South settlers are scattering a Palestinian flock.
*23:13.760- 23:15.080* :  They taunt the shepherds.
*23:19.380- 23:22.400* :  I win, you lose again, one shouts.
*23:24.320- 23:27.060* :  Ahmed Gharakman has endured relentless harassment
*23:27.060- 23:29.380* :  from settlers backed by the most right-wing
*23:29.380- 23:30.880* :  government in Israeli history.
*23:31.780- 23:32.960* :  According to human rights groups,
*23:32.960- 23:35.640* :  the police in military often either refuse to intervene
*23:35.640- 23:37.360* :  or take the side of the settlers.
*23:38.180- 23:40.640* :  Gil and the other activists are the only witnesses
*23:41.120- 23:42.340* :  to what Ahmed endures.
*23:45.540- 23:48.660* :  All respect to him because he helps us with the sheep.
*23:48.820- 23:51.400* :  He protects us in the land and at home.
*23:51.580- 23:53.960* :  There are several very good volunteers.
*23:54.380- 23:57.940* :  The problem is that we are not allowed to go down the hill.
*23:57.980- 24:00.420* :  All this land is forbidden for us.
*24:00.460- 24:01.980* :  This hill is forbidden.
*24:02.080- 24:03.700* :  All of it is forbidden.
*24:07.640- 24:10.540* :  We think the settlements in Israel are very important
*24:10.560- 24:15.720* :  because we think that in Israel we have to connect to our heritage.
*24:16.540- 24:19.220* :  I'm at Shai Rosengarten here in Jerusalem.
*24:19.220- 24:21.880* :  He's a leading figure in the Zionist organization,
*24:21.880- 24:24.700* :  RM Tertzu, who supports the settlements.
*24:25.660- 24:29.040* :  Like Gil Alexander, he's descended from survivors of the Holocaust.
*24:29.900- 24:32.200* :  He says violent settlers are a minority
*24:32.200- 24:35.560* :  and what he calls radical activists are the problem.
*24:36.280- 24:41.080* :  What they're trying to do is just to weaken the Israeli army
*24:41.420- 24:45.460* :  and to sabotage our efforts to make this area peaceful.
*24:48.460- 24:51.020* :  Ahmed and Gil are sitting under an acacia tree,
*24:51.540- 24:52.400* :  resting in the shade.
*24:53.180- 24:55.920* :  The dogs are sprawled, exhausted around us.
*24:56.700- 24:57.680* :  There's time to reflect.
*25:02.560- 25:05.060* :  Gil asks, do you realize when you meet us
*25:05.060- 25:07.000* :  that not all Israelis are the same?
*25:08.640- 25:12.040* :  And Ahmed replies, I know, I know everyone knows.
*25:12.520- 25:15.040* :  Not all Israelis are the same and not all Arabs are the same.
*25:16.460- 25:20.140* :  Finally, Gil says, if it depended on us, tomorrow there would be peace.
*25:22.760- 25:24.640* :  But of course, it doesn't depend on them.
*25:25.200- 25:28.480* :  The politics of the moment appear unremittingly bleak.
*25:29.620- 25:31.660* :  The shepherds and their Israeli supporters
*25:32.520- 25:36.980* :  are the small, quiet voices, isolated figures in this valley.
*25:40.060- 25:41.680* :  A report by Fergal Keen.
*25:42.280- 25:46.080* :  A court in the Philippines has overturned an order to shut down Rappler,
*25:46.080- 25:51.160* :  a new site co-founded by the Nobel Prize winner and investigative journalist Maria Rassa.
*25:51.780- 25:54.220* :  When it lost its license, Rappler had been investigating
*25:54.220- 25:57.360* :  the then President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs.
*25:58.020- 26:01.520* :  Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to Maria Rassa and asked first
*26:01.520- 26:03.640* :  how she felt when she heard the court's decision.
*26:04.500- 26:09.220* :  Oh my gosh, you know, Rappler was clapping, was laughing.
*26:09.380- 26:11.960* :  It's been eight years of harassment.
*26:11.960- 26:15.480* :  This is the case that could have shut us down.
*26:15.680- 26:20.020* :  And to have that finally and to have the decision written,
*26:20.340- 26:23.000* :  you know, one of our lawyers just said it's an overwhelming victory.
*26:23.460- 26:24.780* :  It was a joy for me to read.
*26:24.900- 26:26.920* :  So wow, what a long-winded answer to say.
*26:27.340- 26:27.600* :  Yay!
*26:28.760- 26:29.980* :  So a happy day for you.
*26:30.300- 26:35.460* :  How do you think this is going to affect your news organization now in practical terms?
*26:35.840- 26:40.220* :  Do you know that because there were criminal charges against Rappler
*26:40.220- 26:44.860* :  and because our entire existence was at risk, it meant that we couldn't do
*26:44.860- 26:47.960* :  things simple things, almost like you're running a marathon,
*26:47.960- 26:50.120* :  but you only have, you know, one leg.
*26:50.680- 26:55.700* :  It means now, finally, the SEC can actually change their banner,
*26:55.700- 26:58.840* :  which says we don't exist, restore our license,
*26:59.420- 27:01.240* :  and we can begin to move forward.
*27:01.240- 27:04.700* :  After this happened, we had to close our Jakarta bureau.
*27:04.900- 27:09.080* :  We couldn't even open a bank account outside the Philippines, right?
*27:09.080- 27:12.020* :  So this means we can begin to think of a normal world.
*27:13.500- 27:16.260* :  What about your own circumstances, though?
*27:16.300- 27:20.260* :  Because don't you still face some criminal charges against you?
*27:20.920- 27:25.400* :  Yes, there were at the very beginning about 11, but now they're down to two.
*27:25.860- 27:29.320* :  One of them is directly connected to this decision,
*27:30.080- 27:32.080* :  but the other one is a big one.
*27:32.080- 27:35.940* :  It is the cyber libel case, which has, for whatever reason,
*27:36.640- 27:38.940* :  gone all the way up to the court of last appeal.
*27:39.620- 27:45.820* :  Cyber libel is now at the Supreme Court, and it is an on-bank decision, and we wait.
*27:46.580- 27:51.660* :  That means that I can't leave the country without getting approval from the Supreme Court.
*27:51.740- 27:54.660* :  I mean, there's so many things I can't do because of this.
*27:54.760- 27:57.620* :  It also means that if the Supreme Court rules against me,
*27:57.680- 27:59.760* :  that I could go to jail for up to seven years.
*28:00.720- 28:04.640* :  But I mean, I suppose today's ruling does give you a sense
*28:04.680- 28:06.920* :  that perhaps things may go in your favor.
*28:06.920- 28:11.740* :  I mean, I was just reading the ruling that came down today from the appeals court,
*28:11.740- 28:18.100* :  saying that the Securities and Exchange Commission had acted with grave abuse of discretion,
*28:18.140- 28:25.340* :  it says. Is that kind of them saying that this was politically motivated or that it was unfair?
*28:25.760- 28:31.240* :  I mean, the decision in other parts, and I think we tried to pull it out when we were reading it.
*28:31.320- 28:35.080* :  My three co-founders and I were like yelling at each other, reading the quotes.
*28:35.100- 28:39.220* :  There's a part there that says this should never happen in a democracy.
*28:39.920- 28:47.100* :  I mean, at the darkest of times, we seemed foolish for continuing to submit ourselves to the court.
*28:47.600- 28:54.400* :  It took six years from the time this SEC on Bonk took the case eight years from the time when
*28:54.660- 29:00.120* :  we had heard that this was going to happen. It took a long time, but finally, a sense of justice.
*29:00.700- 29:01.840* :  What does it mean for the country?
*29:03.120- 29:08.580* :  I've asked this all the time. You know, I have a glib answer, which is we were in hell,
*29:08.580- 29:15.220* :  and now we're in purgatory, because it's still far from perfect, right? But we're in purgatory,
*29:15.840- 29:17.400* :  and we can continue to move forward.
*29:20.160- 29:25.900* :  The world of chess has been shocked by allegations that a Russian champion tried to poison her rival
*29:25.900- 29:32.320* :  by covering her pieces in Mercury. Amina Abakareva was caught on security camera,
*29:32.320- 29:37.480* :  acting suspiciously ahead of a tournament in southern Russia last week, Richard Hamilton takes up
*29:37.480- 29:45.620* :  the story. In the CCTV footage, Amina Abakareva can be seen entering the room at the Daghastani
*29:45.620- 29:51.520* :  chess championship, where all the boards are set up, and looking around to check no one else was
*29:51.520- 29:58.480* :  there. She then approaches her opponent's table, takes what appears to be a vile from her bag,
*29:59.080- 30:03.220* :  and pours a substance on some pieces before surveying the room again.
*30:03.940- 30:11.440* :  Umayganat Osmanova needed medical treatment after experiencing severe dizziness and nausea
*30:11.500- 30:17.100* :  during the game, but she was able to continue with the tournament later. It's claimed that
*30:17.100- 30:25.580* :  Ms Abakareva poisoned her childhood rival in an act of revenge after Ms Osmanova had insulted her.
*30:26.320- 30:31.520* :  The incident was reported to the police by the tournament organizers, and the footage was
*30:31.520- 30:38.120* :  handed over, as well as the substance, which was later found to contain Mercury. Depending on
*30:38.120- 30:44.220* :  the amount exposure to Mercury can be fatal, but can also lead to other complications such as
*30:44.220- 30:52.000* :  tremors, memory loss, neuromuscular problems, headaches, and insomnia. Ms Abakareva could face
*30:52.000- 30:58.420* :  up to three years in prison. The Russian chess federation is also considering whether she should
*30:58.420- 31:01.180* :  be banned for life. Richard Hamilton.
