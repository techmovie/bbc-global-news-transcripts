*01:29.440- 01:34.940* :  I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 27th of August. These are our main stories.
*01:34.940- 01:40.320* :  Ukraine has warned that Russia is building up its forces near the strategically important town
*01:40.320- 01:46.200* :  of Pokrovsk. The UN says its humanitarian work in Gaza has been hampered by Israel's new
*01:46.200- 01:52.280* :  evacuation orders, and the US National Security Advisor is in Beijing for the first time in eight years.
*01:54.440- 01:57.680* :  Also in this podcast, a message from the new British Prime Minister.
*02:12.620- 02:17.040* :  The second day in a row, Ukraine has been facing a barrage of Russian missiles and drone attacks
*02:17.040- 02:22.360* :  in which several people have been killed. Here's Vladimir Omelian, who's a major in the Ukrainian
*02:22.360- 02:26.620* :  armed forces, and told the BBC the attacks were a sign of Russian desperation.
*02:27.160- 02:33.760* :  It's another good example that Putin doesn't know what to do and how to handle a situation in
*02:33.760- 02:41.100* :  Kursk region. The last biggest red line was crossed by Ukrainians, and we brought
*02:41.900- 02:48.920* :  war back to Russia, and Kremlin is desperate about that. They're trying to attack our positions
*02:48.920- 02:55.260* :  in the eastern Ukraine, but it looks like they don't have enough resources, and what say
*02:55.260- 03:01.740* :  can only do is to bomb Ukrainian cities. At the same time, Ukraine's military leaders have
*03:01.740- 03:06.180* :  been warning that Russia is building up its forces near the strategically important town of
*03:06.180- 03:10.600* :  Pokrovsk, which has been under Russian assault for several months. I've been talking to our reporter
*03:10.600- 03:17.040* :  in Kiev, Sanobes Patryuk. Russia, again, used nearly every type of weapons to take your grain
*03:17.040- 03:24.600* :  by air, and unfortunately, the hotel in the city of Krivedik was hit overnight,
*03:25.460- 03:30.500* :  two people were killed, five people were wounded, and it's the second time that the hotel
*03:30.500- 03:36.020* :  with civilians was attacked or hit by Russian missiles and drones over the next few days.
*03:36.280- 03:42.020* :  The Ukrainian Air Force and Air Defense said that the latest nights they struck down
*03:42.760- 03:51.500* :  sixty combat drones and five Christmas missiles. Russia used to 91 missiles and drones to
*03:51.500- 03:58.320* :  attack the grain again, and we see that it has enough stockpiles of hypersonic ballistic missiles
*03:59.260- 04:05.560* :  combat drones to attack Ukraine again and again, despite all international sanctions that were
*04:05.560- 04:11.480* :  imposed on Russian defense industries. So we're describing some of the places that were actually
*04:11.480- 04:18.900* :  hit. The idea, I think, the targets were energy infrastructure sides. Do we know how much of
*04:19.260- 04:26.420* :  the damage to those sites has been caused and calibrated yet? There are already new extended
*04:27.320- 04:32.940* :  power cuts in the capital of Ukraine, Kiev. For example, I myself woke up today in the morning
*04:32.940- 04:40.180* :  without electricity in my flat, and it's pretty normal situation, again, for the residents of
*04:40.440- 04:45.300* :  Ukrainian capital. The same happens in other cities of Ukraine. For example, in Nipro,
*04:46.080- 04:51.840* :  people also say that they don't have electricity and water supply in their homes. And in general,
*04:51.840- 04:58.320* :  the Ukrainian authorities asked Ukrainians to prepare for a few weeks or for extended power cuts.
*04:58.600- 05:03.960* :  And some people are seeing this as a response to the incursion into course. We're getting these
*05:03.960- 05:08.880* :  reports about another Ukrainian attack in the Belgorod region. What do we know about that?
*05:08.980- 05:14.120* :  We know that it's already the second wave of Ukrainian attacks on the border with
*05:14.120- 05:19.480* :  the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation. The first wave took place in the middle of August,
*05:19.780- 05:25.100* :  and it turned out to be not so much successful because the Russian forces, they were well prepared,
*05:25.100- 05:31.180* :  and Russia deployed to their one of its best regular army units. For example,
*05:31.180- 05:38.220* :  their 155 brigade of Marines. It's a very experienced brigade, although it suffered from
*05:38.220- 05:44.960* :  heavy losses on the Ukrainian front line. And now there are some reports that Ukrainian forces
*05:44.960- 05:51.780* :  managed to advance a little bit, but so far, I think it's very, very early to say whether there
*05:51.780- 05:57.180* :  is the real advance there, because it looks like the border with the Belgorod region is much better
*05:57.180- 06:03.160* :  fortified. There are lots of minefields there. I also know that there is the state of emergency
*06:03.160- 06:09.280* :  in the Belgorod region, so they have been preparing for a while, and they have closed their access
*06:09.640- 06:15.840* :  to almost 20 villages in the Belgorod region. So it would be really hard for Ukrainian forces
*06:15.840- 06:22.300* :  to advance there, if there is such a plan for now. And that was Stalin's best Piaciuk from the
*06:22.300- 06:27.980* :  BBC's Ukrainian service with me from Kiev. For the first time in eight years, China is hosting a
*06:27.980- 06:32.760* :  U.S. National Security Advisor. Jake Sullivan is in Beijing for talks with the Foreign Minister
*06:32.760- 06:36.200* :  Wang Yi, and ahead of those talks, Mr. Sullivan seemed hopeful.
*06:36.920- 06:42.480* :  I'm looking forward to this afternoon, this evening and tomorrow, we'll delve into a wide range
*06:42.480- 06:47.680* :  of issues, including issues on which we agree on those issues on where there are still differences
*06:47.680- 06:53.880* :  that we need to manage effectively and substantively. And it will be, I think, a very productive
*06:53.880- 06:59.960* :  round of conversations. So on the agenda, Taiwan, Ukraine, the South China Sea, among other issues,
*07:00.120- 07:05.100* :  and the three days of talks will also focus on easing tensions in the relationship between the
*07:05.100- 07:10.000* :  world's two most powerful countries. I got this assessment from our correspondent in Beijing,
*07:10.000- 07:15.920* :  Laura Bicke. Chinese state media said before Jake Sullivan arrived that this meeting came at a
*07:15.920- 07:22.480* :  critical juncture in U.S.-China relations, and there are certainly a lot of differences between
*07:22.480- 07:28.800* :  the two. The key to these meetings is to try to manage those differences. Beijing ahead of time
*07:28.800- 07:35.940* :  has made their priorities clear. For them, Taiwan is the red line, and will always be the red line.
*07:36.360- 07:41.940* :  They maintain that the self-governing island is part of the mainland, and President Xi has vowed
*07:41.940- 07:48.000* :  to retake it by force if necessary. They resist any attempts by American congressmen,
*07:48.000- 07:54.500* :  American politicians, to encourage Taiwanese independence. They're also furious that America
*07:54.500- 08:00.060* :  has given military aid to Taiwan. Secondly, there is the South China Sea, and this is becoming a
*08:00.060- 08:06.400* :  major issue in this week alone. There have been at least three scarabishes between Chinese coast
*08:06.400- 08:11.740* :  guard boats and Filipino boats in the South China Sea. And this is critical because the
*08:11.740- 08:18.240* :  Philippines is a key ally of the United States, and U.S. assets, U.S. warships come very, very close
*08:18.240- 08:23.600* :  to their Chinese counterparts along the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. And what Jake Sullivan
*08:23.600- 08:28.920* :  would like to do during these meetings is encourage more military to military communication.
*08:28.940- 08:35.160* :  The third big issue will be on Ukraine. When the Secretary of State, U.S. Secretary of State,
*08:35.160- 08:40.200* :  Anthony Blinken arrived here earlier this year. He had a warning for his Chinese counterparts.
*08:40.200- 08:47.480* :  He told them that if Chinese companies continued to supply Russia with components that Russia could
*08:47.480- 08:53.180* :  use in its war in Ukraine, there would be consequences. America has carried out that promise. They have
*08:53.180- 08:58.000* :  issued rafts of sanctions. And in fact, on the day that Jake Sullivan announced that he would be
*08:58.000- 09:03.520* :  coming to Beijing, America announced another raft of sanctions against Chinese companies.
*09:04.000- 09:09.780* :  Certainly when it comes to that China denies that they are helping the Russian war effort,
*09:09.780- 09:17.140* :  and they have told America to stop interfering in internal affairs. There is also the issue of
*09:17.140- 09:23.000* :  trade where the U.S. has imposed large tariffs on everything from electric cars to solar panels.
*09:23.480- 09:30.000* :  16 months ago when a Chinese spy balloon was floating over North America and was shot down,
*09:31.180- 09:37.740* :  certainly then the relationship was at a very, very low point. The U.S. Ambassador here in China
*09:37.740- 09:44.360* :  has told me that he was one of the few Americans able to talk to anyone in Beijing since then things
*09:44.360- 09:50.620* :  have changed. And Jake Sullivan has met Wang Yi on four other occasions. There does seem to be
*09:50.620- 09:57.060* :  at least a channel between the two to avoid competition veering into conflict.
*09:57.560- 10:03.040* :  Laura Bicke with me from Beijing. Now for the latest on a dramatic police standoff in the
*10:03.040- 10:08.660* :  Philippines, where a man calling himself the appointed son of God is believed to be hiding inside
*10:08.660- 10:14.240* :  a vast religious compound. Apollo Kibboloi has been accused of child abuse and is wanted by the
*10:14.240- 10:18.800* :  FBI. Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head told me more about him.
*10:19.180- 10:24.340* :  He is a charismatic preacher. They're quite a number of charismatic churches in the Philippines.
*10:25.020- 10:28.660* :  Very much influence on the way the sort of charismatic churches you see in the United States.
*10:28.660- 10:32.240* :  And some of them have become very big and very powerful. And he's one of them. He's in his 70s now.
*10:32.240- 10:38.460* :  He's run this kingdom of Jesus Christ since the 1980s. He claims seven million followers.
*10:39.120- 10:43.600* :  But his real importance is that his power base is down in the southern city of Davao where the
*10:43.600- 10:50.160* :  standoff is taking place. That is also the stronghold of former president Rodrigo Duterte,
*10:50.160- 10:56.420* :  who was at one point an ally of current president Bambomacos. But the two families,
*10:56.420- 11:00.760* :  the marcuses and the Duterties have badly fallen out. There's now a feud between them.
*11:01.180- 11:08.340* :  And so this raid on the pastor, Pastor Kibboloi's compound, although it is in pursuit of an FBI
*11:08.340- 11:15.380* :  warrant and he has wanted on 42 charges, including sex abuse of minor. So there's serious charges.
*11:15.940- 11:20.640* :  But in the Philippines, it's been seen very much as part of this bigger political fight
*11:20.640- 11:26.120* :  between these two powerful families. Meanwhile, the security forces are trying to do what about
*11:26.120- 11:32.000* :  this situation. Well, they're sitting there. There's 2000 police. The local court has actually
*11:32.000- 11:37.440* :  told them to back off and remove their barricades. The police believe that he's hiding somewhere in
*11:37.440- 11:42.960* :  a network of underground bunkers or tunnels. It's not clear how extensive these are. They think
*11:42.960- 11:48.160* :  he's there. So as far as they're concerned, they will stay there until he comes out. There's
*11:48.160- 11:52.880* :  quite a lot of local opposition because this church has a strong following in Davao so people
*11:52.880- 11:58.120* :  have come out in the streets. There's another site to this. By sending 2000 police after this
*11:58.120- 12:04.840* :  pastor, the central government has in a way told former president Duterte we can come onto your
*12:04.840- 12:08.980* :  turf. You've got to understand just how powerful the Duterte's are in Davao. They have been for
*12:08.980- 12:14.700* :  decades. Former president Duterte's daughter, Sarah Duterte is the vice president. So the central
*12:14.700- 12:18.600* :  government in a way is sending a signal saying, well, we've got to write to go there because this guy
*12:18.600- 12:23.300* :  has serious charges outstanding against him. But however influential you are or he is with his
*12:23.300- 12:28.400* :  followers, we will send police in there and grab him if we can and pursue these legal charges.
*12:28.800- 12:33.680* :  So you have to look at this as a political dispute, even though it also involves a colorful rather
*12:33.680- 12:38.580* :  controversial religious preacher. I'll South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head.
*12:39.160- 12:43.320* :  The last time a Labour government came to power in Britain, it tried to project an image of
*12:43.320- 12:48.380* :  sunny optimism. The new British Prime Minister here, starmer by contrast, is projecting
*12:48.380- 12:57.900* :  grim determination. Things are worse than we ever imagined. In the first few weeks, we discovered
*12:57.900- 13:05.040* :  a £22 billion black hole in the public finances. And before anyone says, oh, this is just
*13:05.040- 13:14.520* :  performative or playing politics, let's remember the OBR did not know about it. They wrote a letter
*13:15.000- 13:20.080* :  setting that out. And they didn't know because the last government hid it.
*13:21.040- 13:24.740* :  That was the Prime Minister addressing journalists in the garden of 10 Downing Street,
*13:24.740- 13:29.660* :  the same garden where as he pointed out, one of his conservative predecessors had held
*13:29.660- 13:34.700* :  lockdown busting parties during Covid. His intended contrast was clear.
*13:35.220- 13:37.960* :  Listening for us, our political correspondent Rob Watson.
*13:38.420- 13:42.840* :  I think what he's trying to do is to set the framework for British politics over
*13:43.300- 13:48.420* :  the next 10 years. And you're right that he was elected with an absolutely thumping majority.
*13:49.040- 13:53.760* :  But really, more so because the government, the last government, was so utterly hated,
*13:54.220- 13:59.700* :  the conservative. So his strategy is to say pretty simply, look, things are in a terrible mess.
*13:59.700- 14:04.720* :  It's all the fault of the last government. And so things are going to be painful. Things are
*14:04.720- 14:09.620* :  going to get worse before they get better. And I suppose you would say that is quite a smart,
*14:10.120- 14:14.140* :  a kind of clever way to try and shape the political debate. Although I suppose you have to be
*14:14.140- 14:16.720* :  careful not to get people overly depressed.
*14:17.040- 14:20.400* :  Also, I suppose if you're going to do anything on popular, you need to get on with it
*14:20.880- 14:24.420* :  very quickly. So it's as far away as possible from the next election.
*14:24.680- 14:29.340* :  That's absolutely right. But not only that, but to make sure that you blame someone else.
*14:29.340- 14:34.380* :  In this case, the previous conservative government, so absolutely both of those things.
*14:34.940- 14:38.640* :  And I think it's also that the Labour government would say is that you just,
*14:39.220- 14:44.260* :  because Britain does have problems in terms of its finances, its taxes are already high,
*14:44.260- 14:50.240* :  public services are stretched, that it would just be simply unwise as a politician to promise
*14:50.240- 14:54.740* :  things are going to get better just like that when you know that it's not going to work like that.
*14:55.000- 14:59.260* :  This is what politicians call rolling the pitch, particularly ahead of a budget announcement
*14:59.260- 15:03.860* :  in a few weeks' time. Yes, that is exactly the phrase rolling the pitch. And for anyone who
*15:03.860- 15:08.900* :  doesn't know quite what that means, it's sort of preparing your audience for what's going to come
*15:09.080- 15:12.800* :  and trying to sort of shape the message. And then the message to the audience is going to be,
*15:13.320- 15:16.900* :  you know, look, there's not going to be lots of lovely new public spending.
*15:16.900- 15:21.680* :  It's not going to be all kind of roses and sunshine. Things are going to be difficult.
*15:21.680- 15:24.340* :  Things are going to be painful, was the word, Keir Starmer used.
*15:24.540- 15:27.880* :  But again, that framing, that rolling of the pitch to say, but ah-ha,
*15:28.220- 15:32.020* :  it's all because for the last 14 years, the other lot messed it all up.
*15:32.480- 15:34.340* :  Oh, political correspondent Rob Watson.
*15:36.140- 15:37.360* :  And still to cover this podcast?
*15:37.900- 15:39.600* :  Me and Imolites are the perfect, not I mean.
*15:40.560- 15:42.560* :  I know my brother better than anybody else.
*15:43.400- 15:44.300* :  We're both coming together.
*15:44.780- 15:45.580* :  We love you.
*15:45.760- 15:45.940* :  Great.
*15:46.880- 15:50.280* :  A much anticipated announcement from the British band Oasis.
*15:58.240- 16:02.920* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:03.180- 16:05.580* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little.
*16:05.900- 16:09.500* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*16:09.500- 16:13.300* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:13.560- 16:18.560* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*16:21.720- 16:25.720* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month, new customers on first three month plan only,

*17:04.480- 17:08.900* :  The United Nations has said its humanitarian work in Gaza has been dealt a serious blow
*17:08.900- 17:11.120* :  by Israel's new evacuation orders.
*17:11.680- 17:14.500* :  UN aid workers have been fleeing from their operation centers,
*17:14.500- 17:16.320* :  leading behind essential equipment.
*17:16.960- 17:20.700* :  The orders came as the UN was set to begin its mass vaccination program
*17:20.700- 17:24.460* :  after the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years.
*17:25.020- 17:30.100* :  Louise Wateridge from the UN spoke to BBC News about the lack of safe zones in Gaza.
*17:30.480- 17:35.380* :  There are tanks in areas that used to be designated as safe areas.
*17:36.000- 17:40.400* :  And this is just another testament to there being nowhere safe in the Gaza Strip.
*17:40.400- 17:41.660* :  People have nowhere to go.
*17:42.260- 17:43.760* :  There is nowhere to find safety.
*17:44.280- 17:47.500* :  It's very limited access to humanitarian resources
*17:48.220- 17:51.660* :  because the humanitarian operations are also being displaced
*17:52.340- 17:53.760* :  within these evacuation orders.
*17:54.160- 17:56.020* :  I'm at least correspondent Yola Nell.
*17:56.020- 17:59.140* :  Tell me more about the difficulties the aid agencies are facing.
*17:59.600- 18:04.840* :  What they're saying is that basically only 11% of the entire Gaza Strip
*18:05.160- 18:07.800* :  is not covered by Israeli evacuation orders.
*18:08.040- 18:11.620* :  And it's something we've heard repeatedly from humanitarian workers
*18:12.100- 18:14.540* :  that there is no safe place in Gaza.
*18:14.540- 18:18.900* :  But what has really sort of been so disruptive to humanitarian efforts
*18:18.900- 18:24.360* :  in the past couple of days is this succession of Israeli military evacuation orders.
*18:24.900- 18:30.300* :  And this is how Dira Balach has been so affected with Israeli tanks advancing there.
*18:30.300- 18:34.060* :  This is where the main operations centre for the UN was set up.
*18:34.060- 18:38.420* :  It was relocated from Raffa when Israel went in there in May,
*18:38.420- 18:40.160* :  began its military offensive.
*18:40.700- 18:41.820* :  And then at one point yesterday,
*18:41.820- 18:44.360* :  UN aid operations ground to a hold,
*18:44.360- 18:45.940* :  according to a senior UN official,
*18:45.940- 18:50.680* :  because of the conditions they were not able to deliver aid in that area.
*18:50.860- 18:54.120* :  I just spoke to a spokesperson who did stress that there were other parties
*18:54.120- 18:57.060* :  that have been able to continue with a distribution.
*18:57.060- 19:00.460* :  One of the latest evacuation orders affected 15 premises,
*19:00.460- 19:03.660* :  they're saying belonging to the UN and to NGOs,
*19:03.840- 19:05.700* :  that includes four UN warehouses,
*19:05.700- 19:09.200* :  the Al-Aqsa Hospital, two clinics, three wells,
*19:09.200- 19:11.700* :  a water reservoir and a desalination plant.
*19:11.700- 19:15.080* :  Now we've yet to have a full statement on this from the Israeli military.
*19:15.700- 19:19.580* :  OK, so that's the humanitarian aid a program that's already underway.
*19:19.580- 19:23.900* :  There's also the vaccination against polio program that hasn't even really begun.
*19:24.720- 19:28.500* :  Indeed, we now do have the vaccines for polio in Gaza.
*19:28.900- 19:31.900* :  This is something that was coordinated with the Israeli military authorities
*19:31.900- 19:34.560* :  and the rollout of that vaccination program
*19:34.560- 19:37.580* :  is due to start on the 1st of September.
*19:37.600- 19:39.100* :  So just a few days time,
*19:39.100- 19:42.660* :  the samples of sewage water that were being routinely tested
*19:42.660- 19:45.400* :  showed up traces of the polio virus.
*19:45.440- 19:47.500* :  And we've had health workers coming out,
*19:47.500- 19:50.540* :  you know, saying that this could be really just so dangerous
*19:51.040- 19:52.260* :  for the Palestinian children.
*19:52.600- 19:54.720* :  And for Israelis, too, the Israeli militaries
*19:54.720- 19:58.220* :  already started a vaccination program for its soldiers.
*19:58.440- 19:59.980* :  But the reason this is dangerous,
*19:59.980- 20:01.680* :  it's such an infectious disease.
*20:02.280- 20:04.500* :  And it's something which, you know,
*20:04.500- 20:05.900* :  is affecting children very badly,
*20:06.440- 20:08.920* :  partly because of the dio sanitary conditions.
*20:08.940- 20:13.000* :  And the fact that there is like a lack of access to clean water.
*20:13.500- 20:15.200* :  But also because, of course, you know,
*20:15.200- 20:19.920* :  routine vaccination programs have been totally disrupted by the war.
*20:20.420- 20:21.940* :  Yalla, now with me from Jerusalem.
*20:22.640- 20:25.860* :  Now to the South Pacific and the island nation of Tonga,
*20:25.860- 20:28.600* :  that's where the UN Secretary-General Antonio Caterish
*20:28.600- 20:31.140* :  has issued what he calls a global SOS.
*20:31.680- 20:35.260* :  He says the Pacific is the most vulnerable area of the world right now
*20:35.600- 20:39.060* :  because some of its seas have risen by around 15 centimeters
*20:39.060- 20:40.500* :  in the last 30 years.
*20:40.900- 20:43.940* :  The UN says the global average is about nine centimeters.
*20:44.700- 20:47.600* :  Our correspondent Katie Watson sent this report from Tonga.
*20:49.820- 20:58.420* :  From the arms of Tonga, the call calls out
*20:58.420- 21:03.980* :  to the leader's soft Pacifici, let there be no doubt.
*21:04.460- 21:06.100* :  Tonga is in the spot like this week.
*21:06.420- 21:09.760* :  Leaders from the 18 members that make up the Pacific Island's forum
*21:10.080- 21:12.100* :  from small island nations like Kiribats
*21:12.460- 21:14.760* :  to larger countries, Australia and New Zealand.
*21:14.760- 21:17.000* :  They're all here to discuss the region,
*21:17.000- 21:19.480* :  its vulnerabilities and its priorities.
*21:21.120- 21:23.360* :  But as the opening ceremony took place on Monday morning,
*21:23.360- 21:26.580* :  some delegates struggle to even reach the venue on time
*21:26.580- 21:27.800* :  because of the weather.
*21:28.500- 21:34.700* :  Since I got here, it has not stopped raining as you can probably hear.
*21:34.700- 21:37.620* :  It is absolutely tipping it down.
*21:38.180- 21:39.820* :  The venue is drenched.
*21:40.560- 21:45.860* :  It was even an earthquake earlier and delegates had to be evacuated
*21:46.420- 21:49.480* :  from one of the buildings and walking between venues.
*21:50.340- 21:53.500* :  There's no public transport taxis.
*21:53.540- 21:59.100* :  So I'm wading through the streets to get from one area to another.
*21:59.920- 22:04.240* :  So it's very much all of the vulnerability that Pacific is talking about
*22:04.980- 22:07.640* :  in action on a very important week.
*22:08.540- 22:13.080* :  The Pacific is today the most vulnerable area in the world.
*22:13.880- 22:17.200* :  And there is an enormous injustice in relation to the Pacific.
*22:17.200- 22:18.760* :  And that is the reason why I'm here.
*22:19.060- 22:22.540* :  This is the second time United Nations Secretary-General Antoni Guterres
*22:22.800- 22:23.800* :  has attended the forum.
*22:24.220- 22:26.500* :  Climate change is an important issue for him.
*22:26.920- 22:29.200* :  And his warnings come as new data from the UN
*22:29.200- 22:31.700* :  shows how rising sea levels are picking up pace
*22:32.240- 22:34.580* :  and threatening Pacific islands more than ever.
*22:35.080- 22:38.020* :  First, they do not contribute at all to climate change.
*22:38.700- 22:41.840* :  Second, they are in the first line of the impacts of climate change.
*22:42.620- 22:46.920* :  I was in several coastal areas of the two islands that I visited
*22:47.700- 22:50.820* :  and I've seen how the sea level rise together with the storms.
*22:51.300- 22:54.100* :  He's forcing people to leave to other places.
*22:54.540- 22:58.700* :  Everything that is happening today as a threat in climate change
*22:59.140- 23:00.820* :  is multiplied in the Pacific islands
*23:01.700- 23:04.620* :  and so they face a real, as existential threat.
*23:09.360- 23:11.960* :  Not far from the venue, there's a street parade taking place.
*23:12.280- 23:14.620* :  Dancers representing many of the Pacific islands
*23:15.240- 23:17.440* :  there's one big banner saying, we're not drowning,
*23:17.740- 23:18.300* :  we're fighting.
*23:19.020- 23:21.960* :  Another reads, the sea levels rising, so are we.
*23:22.820- 23:24.600* :  Joseph Sekulu is from Tonga
*23:24.600- 23:26.620* :  and is the Pacific Director at 350,
*23:27.300- 23:28.840* :  a climate change advocacy group.
*23:29.960- 23:32.920* :  Climate change is one of those things that's just going to exacerbate
*23:32.960- 23:34.540* :  all the disasters that we already feel.
*23:35.020- 23:37.140* :  And so it's important to always ground these conversations
*23:37.180- 23:38.280* :  in that kind of reality
*23:38.760- 23:40.840* :  and important for leaders, especially like Australia,
*23:41.220- 23:42.780* :  to come and witness these things for themselves.
*23:47.640- 23:50.720* :  These populations may be small, but their voices are getting louder
*23:51.100- 23:54.300* :  or the wild, the threats to their very existence, getting bigger.
*23:57.040- 23:58.100* :  Katie Watson reporting.
*23:58.660- 24:01.780* :  The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is beginning a three-day trip
*24:01.780- 24:05.080* :  to West Africa, as his government comes under increasing pressure
*24:05.460- 24:07.900* :  over a major upsurge in migrant arrivals.
*24:08.380- 24:11.240* :  Spain is one of the main European destinations for migrants,
*24:11.240- 24:14.800* :  making a perilous sea journey in overcrowded wooden boats.
*24:15.440- 24:17.940* :  Mr. Sanchez is starting his trip in Mauritania
*24:17.940- 24:19.960* :  before going to Senegal and Gambia.
*24:20.240- 24:22.600* :  Rob Young spoke to the Associated Press journalist,
*24:22.600- 24:24.380* :  Renata Brito, in Barcelona.
*24:24.820- 24:27.020* :  It's the second time this year he's been to the region.
*24:27.020- 24:27.960* :  He's going to the region.
*24:28.000- 24:32.180* :  He was in Martín in February when alongside EU officials
*24:32.180- 24:34.700* :  they announced a need package to try and tackle
*24:34.700- 24:36.420* :  this issue of irregular migration.
*24:36.980- 24:39.120* :  But now he's going to the Gambia for the first time
*24:39.120- 24:41.200* :  and he's going to Senegal as well.
*24:41.840- 24:44.960* :  And he's really trying to reinforce his commitment
*24:44.960- 24:47.960* :  to the region, reinforced bilateral relations
*24:48.020- 24:50.300* :  to make sure that they're cooperating
*24:50.300- 24:53.340* :  and they're controlling the coast and the borders.
*24:53.940- 24:56.560* :  There is Spanish police deployed in all three countries
*24:56.700- 24:58.280* :  trying to work with local authorities
*24:58.280- 25:00.820* :  to stop smugglers and stop migrants.
*25:00.820- 25:02.780* :  But it's a very difficult issue to tackle.
*25:03.340- 25:06.900* :  The youth in that region don't see a lot of job opportunities
*25:06.900- 25:10.100* :  and they want to come to Europe to seek better lives.
*25:10.100- 25:13.780* :  And also in some cases flee persecution, conflict,
*25:13.780- 25:17.260* :  climate change, and other issues affecting the region.
*25:17.640- 25:20.620* :  Right, so Spain is more concerned with, you think,
*25:21.420- 25:25.800* :  curbing the trafficking and trying to reduce the number of boat journeys
*25:25.820- 25:28.140* :  to the Canary Islands and other parts of Spain
*25:28.140- 25:30.800* :  rather than actually dealing with some of the root causes
*25:30.800- 25:32.540* :  that lead people to leave in the first place.
*25:33.240- 25:36.480* :  Well, the Spanish government has says it is actually investing
*25:36.540- 25:39.340* :  in job creation for youth and it will announce
*25:39.340- 25:42.920* :  several small agreements other than border control
*25:42.920- 25:46.680* :  and police cooperation to tackle the root causes.
*25:46.820- 25:49.920* :  But these are longer-term projects that take time
*25:49.920- 25:52.080* :  to see the effects they could have
*25:52.080- 25:54.380* :  and any improvement will take years.
*25:55.000- 25:56.240* :  And the issue is right now.
*25:56.500- 25:58.160* :  So it is a very complex issue.
*25:58.160- 26:00.900* :  It's not something you can solve in one visit
*26:01.680- 26:03.100* :  and they are aware of that.
*26:03.100- 26:06.300* :  But Spanish government says it's just showing, again,
*26:06.300- 26:08.520* :  it's commitment to the region
*26:09.220- 26:10.760* :  and to try and find the solution.
*26:10.760- 26:12.640* :  Alongside it's African partners.
*26:12.880- 26:16.920* :  And is it more of a political problem issue in Spain?
*26:17.060- 26:19.220* :  Or is it one of the Canary Islands,
*26:19.220- 26:21.640* :  these islands off the Northwest Coast Africa,
*26:21.640- 26:22.960* :  which are big tourist destinations,
*26:23.020- 26:24.800* :  and so they are used to an influx of people,
*26:25.140- 26:28.080* :  just being unable to cope with the number of migrant arrivals?
*26:28.620- 26:29.700* :  I think it's a bit of both.
*26:29.700- 26:32.680* :  I think there is a real issue of irregular arrivals.
*26:32.680- 26:36.300* :  But migration, as you know, is highly politicized across Europe.
*26:37.000- 26:38.580* :  It's used in elections.
*26:39.380- 26:41.880* :  And so, in the Canary Islands, specifically,
*26:41.880- 26:43.460* :  the issue that they're having
*26:44.080- 26:46.320* :  is with young migrants who travel alone
*26:46.400- 26:50.100* :  because the adult migrants, they go to mainland Spain
*26:50.100- 26:52.540* :  or to other parts of Europe, reunite with family,
*26:53.080- 26:54.900* :  continue to get on with their lives.
*26:55.440- 26:57.420* :  But the issue of unaccompanied minors,
*26:57.480- 26:59.400* :  which has really affected the Canary Islands,
*27:00.020- 27:02.100* :  means that they are stuck on the islands
*27:02.100- 27:05.240* :  because the regional government has to take charge
*27:05.240- 27:08.280* :  of these teenagers and children traveling alone.
*27:08.780- 27:09.760* :  And they are overwhelmed.
*27:09.760- 27:14.280* :  They say they have more than 5,000 teen and child migrants
*27:14.280- 27:17.240* :  under their care when their capacity is 2,000.
*27:17.880- 27:21.320* :  And other regions are Spain are not willing to share
*27:21.320- 27:24.520* :  the care of these young migrants with them and they're struggling.
*27:24.520- 27:28.100* :  So that's the main complaint from the Canary Islands right now.
*27:28.600- 27:31.620* :  The Associated Press journalist, Renato Brito, in Barcelona.
*27:32.400- 27:35.860* :  Now, what would 90's Britpop be without the band Oasis?
*27:36.200- 27:39.160* :  You're gonna be the one that saves me.
*27:41.980- 27:44.840* :  In 30 years since the brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher
*27:44.840- 27:47.360* :  launched their debut album, definitely maybe.
*27:47.780- 27:50.800* :  It's 15 years since their Acrimonius split.
*27:51.400- 27:53.380* :  Now, after ramping up speculation online,
*27:53.380- 27:55.240* :  they're getting back together.
*27:55.620- 27:58.460* :  Here's how that news was announced on BBC Radio stations.
*28:03.800- 28:06.380* :  As Tina said, it's happening.
*28:07.020- 28:08.760* :  Liam Gallagher just put on social media.
*28:09.060- 28:10.880* :  This is it. This is happening.
*28:11.460- 28:12.340* :  Tickets on sale.
*28:12.820- 28:16.200* :  This saturday for Oasis.
*28:16.200- 28:18.740* :  This is Radio One Breakfast.
*28:19.420- 28:21.760* :  So yes, Oasis are reuniting.
*28:21.840- 28:23.460* :  This is Fusion Edinburgh.
*28:23.460- 28:25.960* :  Yes, as you said, Dublin, Wembley, Manchester,
*28:25.960- 28:28.480* :  Heaton Park and kicking off at Cardiff,
*28:28.540- 28:29.760* :  Friends of Palatee Stadium.
*28:29.760- 28:31.400* :  This is Radio Manchester.
*28:32.060- 28:35.900* :  The 15 years to the day after they split up, Oasis,
*28:35.900- 28:40.840* :  a definite rate, not maybe, getting back together.
*28:41.160- 28:43.020* :  Oasis live, 25.
*28:43.660- 28:45.280* :  And among the delighted Oasis fans,
*28:45.280- 28:47.660* :  Radio DJ Edith Bowman, who knows them.
*28:47.980- 28:50.780* :  It's always been the last question when I've interviewed them
*28:50.780- 28:52.220* :  over the years since they split up,
*28:52.220- 28:53.240* :  is when will it happen.
*28:53.760- 28:56.220* :  And it's been interesting, both their takes on that over the years.
*28:56.220- 28:57.860* :  Liam's always been up for it.
*28:57.860- 28:59.980* :  You know, he's always been, yeah, definitely.
*28:59.980- 29:01.400* :  You know, I love the band.
*29:01.960- 29:02.880* :  I'd love to get back together.
*29:02.880- 29:05.800* :  Whereas Nol's very much being slightly more standoffish about it.
*29:05.920- 29:07.640* :  So I'm so thrilled.
*29:07.680- 29:09.640* :  I think it's kind of been a long time coming.
*29:09.640- 29:12.580* :  I'm happy for Peggy, their mum.
*29:13.100- 29:14.680* :  And I just think for so many fans,
*29:14.680- 29:17.400* :  both in terms of those fans that've been around since the start,
*29:17.780- 29:19.900* :  those fans that they've grown over the years, you know,
*29:19.900- 29:21.540* :  they're a band that passed down generations.
*29:22.020- 29:23.240* :  Mine, if it just takes me this morning,
*29:23.240- 29:24.360* :  so excited about it.
*29:24.400- 29:27.380* :  My 11-year-old, so excited about it.
*29:27.900- 29:29.560* :  And I think that they are one of those few bands
*29:29.560- 29:32.280* :  that their music can't transcend generations.
*29:32.500- 29:35.180* :  So it's going to be a hot ticket.
*29:35.420- 29:37.100* :  So the fallout was definitely real.
*29:37.280- 29:38.740* :  Is this getting together real?
*29:38.740- 29:40.280* :  If it's real, what made it happen?
*29:40.760- 29:41.580* :  I do think it's real.
*29:41.580- 29:42.900* :  I think time to be honest.
*29:42.900- 29:44.660* :  I think time, and I also think that
*29:45.240- 29:47.460* :  there was a great documentary that came out a couple of years ago.
*29:47.480- 29:49.580* :  Called Supersonic, that Matt Whitecross directed.
*29:49.580- 29:53.540* :  Fantastic film, where he really did some fantastic work
*29:53.540- 29:55.220* :  interviewing the bands independently.
*29:55.760- 29:57.600* :  And the thing that came out from that was
*29:57.820- 29:59.700* :  an honest state as to who they were,
*29:59.700- 30:02.340* :  as characters within that band and within that time.
*30:03.020- 30:04.320* :  And I think that, you know,
*30:04.320- 30:07.140* :  Noel says themselves in it that he was a bit of a bully.
*30:07.640- 30:10.120* :  And Liam's just like this energized child,
*30:10.120- 30:12.720* :  his enthusiasm for what he does is infectious,
*30:13.000- 30:14.120* :  but doesn't have a filter.
*30:14.620- 30:16.100* :  And I think through time there's been
*30:16.100- 30:20.060* :  those two sort of opposites have kind of sort of come more together.
*30:20.520- 30:23.320* :  Liam's putting so much work as an artist, you know,
*30:23.320- 30:25.220* :  in terms of he loves playing live,
*30:25.220- 30:26.860* :  being out there and singing those songs.
*30:27.360- 30:28.480* :  It's so important to him.
*30:28.860- 30:30.420* :  And he's just come off this definitely, maybe,
*30:30.420- 30:32.320* :  to just headlined Reading and Leeds that we can.
*30:32.980- 30:36.420* :  And he's put the work in and he's almost proved to know that
*30:36.720- 30:38.540* :  he can kind of do it without him in a way.
*30:39.000- 30:42.040* :  But there is nothing better than to them being on stage together.
*30:42.040- 30:43.320* :  And you see that picture of them,
*30:43.640- 30:45.940* :  whether they took it in the same studio or not together.
*30:45.940- 30:48.660* :  But that picture of them now in those faces,
*30:49.360- 30:50.400* :  those siblings together.
*30:50.400- 30:53.400* :  It's just so exciting because they're two of them together
*30:53.400- 30:54.660* :  as like nothing else, really.
*30:54.760- 30:55.740* :  You can get that from that video.
*30:55.740- 30:57.680* :  They're posted on social media this morning.
*30:57.680- 30:59.900* :  It takes you back to those epic performances.
*31:00.420- 31:01.800* :  And the magic of it.
*31:01.800- 31:04.840* :  My 18-year-old is at Reading Festival watching him on Sunday.
*31:04.840- 31:06.840* :  It's interesting how Liam, particularly,
*31:06.840- 31:08.840* :  has picked up a whole following among young people.
*31:09.660- 31:11.920* :  Well, absolutely because I think so many of those young people
*31:11.920- 31:12.780* :  have heard those songs,
*31:12.780- 31:15.240* :  whether it be just from the radio or from parents and stuff.
*31:15.620- 31:18.100* :  But it's not that often you actually get the chance
*31:18.100- 31:21.320* :  to see those artists or hear those artists
*31:21.320- 31:25.580* :  that you have learned through parents or older family members
*31:25.580- 31:28.640* :  to see them live and for them to still to connect in that way.
*31:29.020- 31:32.320* :  And those songs always well because they're great songs.
*31:33.060- 31:35.680* :  The radio DJ and Oasis fan, Edith Bowman.
*31:37.920- 31:39.040* :  And that's all from us for now.
*31:39.040- 31:41.560* :  There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
*31:41.880- 31:44.380* :  Before we go, we're planning a special program in Montreal
*31:44.380- 31:47.460* :  in Canada next month at the One Young World Summit,
*31:47.460- 31:49.400* :  where young people from across the world

*31:52.600- 31:55.480* :  For that, we'd like to know what question you'd put
*31:55.840- 31:58.640* :  to a group of young people setting out to change the world.
*31:58.640- 32:01.420* :  Could be about the environment, or world peace,
