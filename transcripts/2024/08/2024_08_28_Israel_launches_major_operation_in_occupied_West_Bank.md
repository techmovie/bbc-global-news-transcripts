*00:45.780- 00:51.320* :  opposite of what Big Wireless does. They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally,
*00:51.320- 00:56.400* :  when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our
*00:56.400- 01:01.540* :  prices due to not hating you. That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a
*01:01.540- 01:07.820* :  month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch. $45 up from payment

*01:16.160- 01:19.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:20.920- 01:26.500* :  I'm Andrew Peechner at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 28th of August. These are our main stories.
*01:26.580- 01:32.520* :  Israel's carrying out a major military operation in the occupied West Bank, targeting at least four
*01:32.520- 01:37.920* :  Palestinian cities at the same time. As Ukraine's president says the incursion into Russian
*01:37.920- 01:42.840* :  territory is part of a victory plan, we hear from a resident in the city of Suja in the Russian
*01:42.840- 01:48.280* :  course region. Japan issues an emergency warning as a powerful typhoon approaches.
*01:50.660- 01:56.180* :  Also in this podcast, Afghan women define new Taliban law by posting videos of singing.
*01:56.680- 02:05.600* :  Zadito, Amrissani, Mohrichamushi, Dahannamro, Mahayyamikunito, Amrissani, Abunonamro,
*02:05.780- 02:10.700* :  and more than 4,000 athletes from around the world are in Paris for the start of the Paralympics.
*02:13.920- 02:17.540* :  We'll start in the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October.
*02:18.000- 02:22.800* :  The focus of much of the world's media has been on Gaza and the increasingly tense border between
*02:22.800- 02:28.020* :  Israel and Lebanon. But violence in the Israeli occupied West Bank has also been surging.
*02:28.360- 02:33.020* :  Hundreds of people have lost their lives and now a major Israeli military operation, the biggest
*02:33.020- 02:38.880* :  in years, is underway in the north of the occupied West Bank. The assault by Land and Air began
*02:38.880- 02:44.120* :  after Israeli soldiers entered refugee camps in the Jordan Valley, at least nine people have been
*02:44.120- 02:48.000* :  killed. Noroda is a former spokeswoman for the Palestinian Authority.
*02:48.620- 02:53.840* :  Since the early hours of dawn, we've seen a large contingence of Israeli forces
*02:54.680- 03:02.000* :  raiding and occupying Jeanine and Tulkarem, particularly targeting the refugee camps over there,
*03:02.000- 03:08.620* :  most notably blocking the movement of paramedics and the entry and exit from hospitals,
*03:08.620- 03:16.620* :  which is a repeat or a mirroring of the tactics used in Gaza. There's widespread destruction
*03:16.620- 03:21.840* :  reported in those areas. The IDF has been giving some details of its operation,
*03:21.840- 03:27.480* :  as our correspondent Yolana Neltomi from Jerusalem. They have confirmed with footage that they
*03:27.480- 03:33.080* :  carried out an air strike in Farah Urban refugee camps in the north of the Jordan Valley,
*03:33.080- 03:39.640* :  and there's also been another air strike on a car near Jeanine that was overnight. But the Israeli
*03:39.640- 03:45.180* :  military says that this ongoing major military operation, it is making arrests, it says it is
*03:45.180- 03:50.780* :  dismantling explosives and has confiscated a quantity of weapons, releasing pictures, it says,
*03:51.260- 03:57.420* :  showed that. Certainly we've seen in footage shared on social media, Israeli armored vehicles
*03:57.420- 04:04.420* :  entering and closing off these different towns and cities. The main focus is Jeanine, Tulkarem
*04:04.680- 04:10.480* :  and Tubas, and the speculation is that this really could go on for several days. Palestinian
*04:10.480- 04:15.440* :  armed groups have put out defiant statements saying that they're fighting Israeli enforcers as
*04:15.440- 04:20.520* :  they encounter them. They say they've been using explosives against military bulldozers,
*04:20.920- 04:26.280* :  and that they have been gun battles as well. At the moment, locals in Jeanine have been telling
*04:26.280- 04:32.560* :  us that it is quieter than it has been, but still this is an ongoing military operation people
*04:32.620- 04:38.040* :  are really very afraid to leave their homes. Obviously that there's always been disruption in the
*04:38.040- 04:43.900* :  West Bank, but how big an escalation is this to what's happening there? Yeah, and violence in
*04:43.900- 04:48.740* :  the West Bank was going on prior to the war in Gaza. In fact, that was really a main focus of
*04:49.480- 04:55.480* :  the Israeli military saying it was involved in a wide-scale counter-terrorism operation. We
*04:55.480- 05:01.260* :  had near-nightly raids before the war, but then violence has just surged further since the start
*05:01.260- 05:06.580* :  of the war. Israel really sort of stepped up action against Palestinian armed groups, particularly
*05:06.580- 05:13.020* :  Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and at the same time, we've seen these increased vigilante attacks by
*05:13.020- 05:19.360* :  extremist settlers on Palestinian communities. And the Israeli foreign minister has suggested
*05:19.380- 05:25.600* :  that the West Bank should become like Gaza, so Palestinians can just be told to move when Israel
*05:25.600- 05:30.220* :  needs them to. What sort of reaction has it been to that? This is really something that's causing
*05:30.220- 05:35.580* :  alarm, a message that the foreign minister's railcats put out on the social media platform
*05:35.580- 05:42.800* :  X earlier. He linked what's been happening in the West Bank to Iran, said that Iran was seeking
*05:42.800- 05:48.640* :  to open up a new front, a new terror network to attack Israel as he put it in the West Bank
*05:48.640- 05:55.160* :  by funding and supporting armed groups there. And he raised the possibility of Palestinian
*05:55.160- 06:00.880* :  evacuation orders, the sort of temporary evacuation orders as he described it, and as has been
*06:00.880- 06:06.540* :  done in the Gaza Strip during the war there. Now, a Palestinian official has come up quickly
*06:07.480- 06:12.040* :  representing the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. His spokesman's really
*06:12.040- 06:17.520* :  accused Israel of trying to escalate the conflict in Gaza with this action in the West Bank,
*06:17.940- 06:21.860* :  and warning that the results could be in his words, dire and dangerous.
*06:22.420- 06:27.940* :  Yellow nail in Jerusalem. Ukrainian officials say Russian bombardments in the past 24
*06:27.940- 06:33.140* :  hours or so have killed at least 11 people. Six died on Wednesday in the partially Russian
*06:33.140- 06:39.060* :  occupied region of Donetsk where fighting is at its heaviest. Across the border, Ukraine's military
*06:39.060- 06:45.460* :  action in course continues. It says it now controls 100 Russian settlements. The BBC has been
*06:45.460- 06:51.160* :  speaking to a resident of the small Russian town of Suja, now occupied by Ukraine. We'll call her
*06:51.240- 06:56.460* :  Irina. She's now moved to Korsk City, which is 100 kilometers away, to stay with family members.
*06:56.920- 07:01.080* :  She says they were given no warning that Ukrainian troops were about to enter the town,
*07:01.400- 07:04.820* :  despite Moscow saying it had sent buses to move people to safety.
*07:05.700- 07:11.320* :  I'm a beautician. I have many clients and none of the people I know have received any help
*07:11.320- 07:18.020* :  with evacuation. We are all in curse in a lentice studio flat which we share between the five of us.
*07:18.660- 07:24.740* :  We are grateful that we found a place to live. But now the problem is we don't have the
*07:24.740- 07:31.360* :  means to pay for it. All of my work was left in Suja. I have no equipment, no materials,
*07:32.180- 07:39.460* :  no regard to move around. My husband lost income too. He had a small shop in town. All his stock
*07:39.460- 07:47.400* :  remains there. All we have is debt. And how is situation in Korsk now? Do you feel relatively
*07:47.400- 07:54.020* :  safe? Korsk is also being sheltered and this makes us anxious. Those who lived in Korsk
*07:54.220- 08:00.060* :  moved away deeper in Russia, replaced by those who came from Suja. And do you have any communication
*08:00.060- 08:06.560* :  with Suja? There is no reach. Could you imagine how it smells there now? Rotting food in
*08:06.560- 08:12.980* :  freezes, abandoned animals. Our relatives had 30 pigs and they had to leave them all.
*08:14.180- 08:19.760* :  If only we were given a couple of hours to evacuate or at least a green corridor.
*08:20.340- 08:25.040* :  Who should have given you this warning from what I understand Russia did not know about
*08:25.040- 08:31.700* :  any impending incursion but everyone else knew? I work with women, many of whom have relatives
*08:31.700- 08:37.800* :  in Ukraine and they told me that something was going on in Suja across the border. The Ukrainians
*08:37.800- 08:43.660* :  brought in heavy machinery, people noticed some movements, evacuations were taken place,
*08:43.660- 08:50.920* :  why we, the regular people, knew that something was brooding across in Suja but nobody else did.
*08:51.080- 08:56.440* :  You blame the Russian security forces then? Certainly, but they probably couldn't expect that there
*08:56.440- 09:02.440* :  would be an incursion. There was a lot of shelving during the last two years but the border was never
*09:02.440- 09:09.020* :  crossed. You told me earlier that in the last two years the whole of Suja helped the Russian
*09:09.020- 09:15.660* :  soldiers in defense against Ukraine. My husband helped the soldiers so much without asking for anything
*09:15.660- 09:21.720* :  else in return so that our boys could defend us. He was giving them gloves, mouse traps,
*09:21.720- 09:28.400* :  for when they were stuck in the trenches. We are ordinary people, nothing depends on us. Do you
*09:28.400- 09:35.080* :  think we want this? That's all we want is peace because if the fighting continues Suja will disappear.
*09:36.020- 09:40.580* :  Someone we're calling Irina who's fled the Russian town of Suja, talking to my colleague
*09:40.580- 09:46.580* :  Natalia Gorscheva-Dase. The Olympics may be over, there will be more sporting action in Paris
*09:46.580- 09:51.600* :  though with the 17th Paralympic Games, the opening ceremony taking place on Wednesday evening.
*09:52.120- 09:57.660* :  More than 4,000 athletes from all over the world and a team of refugees will compete during the next
*09:57.660- 10:03.300* :  couple of weeks. Here's our sports reporter, Mani Jasmine. Two and a half weeks after the Olympics,
*10:03.300- 10:09.100* :  Paris is back in competition mode. All the Paralympic sports will use Olympic venues.
*10:09.560- 10:14.580* :  The beach volleyball sand pit at the Eiffel Tower has been levelled and covered by an artificial
*10:14.580- 10:20.280* :  pitch for the Blind Football. It's expected the record attendance of a Blind Football match of
*10:20.280- 10:26.900* :  5,000 will be broken but fans there and at the Blind's specific sport of goalball will have to stay
*10:26.900- 10:33.280* :  quiet throughout play so the players can hear the ball. France are aiming to win 20 gold medals
*10:33.280- 10:39.080* :  and finish in the top eight of the medal's table for the first time in 32 years. One of their
*10:39.080- 10:44.920* :  biggest hopes is wheelchair tennis player Stefan Uday. He's already won three Paralympic gold medals
*10:44.920- 10:52.780* :  and 24 grand slam titles. I hope we're being seen so usually as athletes and not as
*10:53.260- 10:58.560* :  even before the end of the Olympics, the Paralympics were touched by controversy through
*10:58.560- 11:04.500* :  the presence of the first openly transgender athlete. 50-year-old Italian visually impaired
*11:04.500- 11:11.760* :  sprinter Valentina Petrilo will run in the 100 and 200 metres. Some of her rivals say that
*11:11.760- 11:18.240* :  living as a man for 44 years before transitioning has given her an unfair physiological advantage.
*11:18.380- 11:24.100* :  Petrilo says that sport should teach the value of inclusion and she should be allowed to express
*11:24.100- 11:30.140* :  herself in her own gender. The president of the International Paralympic Committee Andrew Parsons
*11:30.140- 11:35.620* :  says that transgender rules in Paris sport are too vague so she's welcome to compete.
*11:36.140- 11:42.960* :  The sport moment has to guide by science come up with better answers for transgender athletes so
*11:42.960- 11:48.940* :  we need to based on science have better and probably a united answer because as the reality of the
*11:48.940- 11:54.700* :  world they deserve an answer which cannot be well this week you can compete maybe in the future
*11:54.700- 11:59.980* :  you cannot compete. For the moment World Paralympics rules allow her to compete so she will be
*11:59.980- 12:04.800* :  welcome as any other athlete. During the games the Paralympic Village will host the largest
*12:04.800- 12:10.620* :  gathering of disabled people in the world. It's 100% accessible according to the International
*12:10.620- 12:16.240* :  Paralympic Committee the living areas don't have steps the bathrooms have plenty of space for
*12:16.240- 12:22.820* :  manoeuvre and the all-important electrical sockets are 45 centimetres above the floor within reach
*12:22.820- 12:29.160* :  regardless of disability. 50,000 people are expected to attend the opening ceremony on the
*12:29.160- 12:34.620* :  Place de la Concorde in Champs-Élysées. The head of the Paralympic Organising Committee Tony
*12:34.620- 12:40.700* :  Estange says that it will be a daring ceremony that disrupts and shakes up the clichés and
*12:40.700- 12:47.960* :  prejudices about disability. With more competitors from more nations than ever before and 80% of
*12:47.960- 12:53.980* :  tickets already sold the Paralympics have a chance to showcase what disabled people can do
*12:54.380- 12:59.060* :  and leave the negative portrayals and assumptions about disability in the shadows.
*13:00.280- 13:06.020* :  Estonia's crime rate is so low it's jails are only half full so the Baltic nation is now
*13:06.020- 13:10.020* :  considering whether it should rent out some of those empty cells to other countries.
*13:10.660- 13:14.860* :  Wouldn't be the first time this has happened the Netherlands and Kosovo have rented out space in
*13:14.860- 13:20.440* :  their jails. Estonia's Justice Minister Lisa Pagosta is hoping she can persuade her colleagues to
*13:20.440- 13:27.780* :  back the idea which she says could raise 30 million euros a year. Going back to 1990s after we
*13:27.780- 13:37.320* :  regained our independence the rate of criminality was quite high so we literally put the criminals
*13:37.320- 13:44.020* :  to the prison. It improved the situation quite quickly and now we are in the situation that we have
*13:44.420- 13:52.660* :  new wonderful very secure modern prisons but only half of the place is filled so that obvious
*13:52.660- 14:00.220* :  solution for that would be that we raise our export. So we would look at our native countries
*14:00.220- 14:08.560* :  our good companions and discuss what would be the best secure solution for both of the countries.
*14:09.300- 14:16.140* :  When the prison time is up to the end the prisoners will return to the original country.
*14:16.940- 14:22.480* :  To build the schools and hospitals we need actually investments justonia renting out
*14:22.480- 14:28.500* :  these places is one of the possibilities to get the money and when we are now looking to the
*14:28.500- 14:35.800* :  statistics in Europe or in the wider region we actually see that the criminality rates are raising.
*14:35.820- 14:43.880* :  They are raising in most of the countries and we assume that that would hit Estonia as well.
*14:44.620- 14:52.140* :  So it might be that we need these places ourselves in like say seven years because all the prisons
*14:52.140- 14:59.040* :  are very modern very new ones so it's no reason to knock them down. Estonia is just this minister
*14:59.040- 15:06.080* :  Lisa Perkoster. Still to come we'll check out the new Barbie phone which can't get online.
*15:06.080- 15:12.140* :  This phone comes without social media and because we've seen this search in actually young people
*15:12.140- 15:16.220* :  wanting to have a digital detox this is actually delivering on what they're demanding right now.

*15:53.740- 15:58.720* :  team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation they said yes.
*15:58.760- 16:03.640* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts they said
*16:03.700- 16:08.980* :  what the f**k are you talking about you insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap we're cutting the price
*16:08.980- 16:15.240* :  of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*16:15.420- 16:18.720* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month new customers on first three month plan only
*16:18.720- 16:20.880* :  taxes and fees extra. Speed slower above 40 gigabyte CDTales.
*16:25.380- 16:31.140* :  Pope Francis has condemned efforts to repel migrants and block their roots calling them a grave sin.
*16:31.700- 16:37.040* :  During his weekly general audience he strongly criticised those who don't help migrant boats or
*16:37.040- 16:42.880* :  who abandon refugees in the desert saying migration policy worldwide should be based on justice
*16:42.880- 16:47.900* :  and brotherhood. As record numbers of young Africans risk their lives trying to get to the
*16:47.900- 16:52.840* :  Spanish Canary Islands off the northwest coast of Africa this week Spain's Prime Minister Pedro
*16:52.840- 16:58.800* :  Sanchez is visiting Senegal, Mauritania and the Gambia for talks on the issue. Victoria O'Hunder
*16:58.800- 17:03.680* :  has been talking to our reporter Kedithi R2C say who's been looking into this new route and
*17:03.680- 17:10.040* :  talking to migrants and their loved ones. Most of these migrants used the route from West Africa
*17:10.040- 17:18.080* :  to the Canary Islands and it's linked to first of all more border control in most European
*17:18.080- 17:24.860* :  countries considering that they have toughened their migration policies and so West African
*17:24.860- 17:33.480* :  migrants have increasingly chosen the Canary Islands route because it requires less hassle in the
*17:33.480- 17:41.660* :  sense that they would need to cross the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean if they choose the
*17:41.660- 17:49.040* :  Mediterranean alternative. It appears to be an option that would potentially result in more success.
*17:49.480- 17:54.660* :  You've been speaking to people who've taken this journey as well as their family members. What
*17:54.660- 17:59.080* :  kind of stories have they shared with you? You know I think it's important to emphasize that
*17:59.240- 18:04.520* :  these are people who actually really love their countries from what they've told me. They just
*18:04.520- 18:11.840* :  want to leave but it's a bit more complex. I spoke to a Senegalese lady whose name is Amina. Her son
*18:11.840- 18:18.780* :  was sadly found dead on a boat in the Dominican Republic earlier this once. It came as a shock
*18:18.780- 18:24.080* :  because he was initially working in Mauritania. Let's hear what she says. Hey I'm going to go to
*18:24.080- 18:31.320* :  the wedding. He had mentioned to travel for a long time but he never mentioned he was planning to
*18:31.320- 18:38.320* :  take a boat. I asked him where he was planning to go and he said Morocco but a week after his departure
*18:38.320- 18:45.320* :  he still hadn't heard from him every single day I would ask myself where is he? We found out he
*18:45.320- 18:52.120* :  had died on social media. His only desire was to make a living and support his family. My heart is
*18:52.120- 19:00.600* :  broken. You know your body is found in the Dominican Republic and you had left off from Senegal.
*19:00.600- 19:07.960* :  I just did a Google search and it's 5,900 kilometers we're talking about but what are the West African
*19:07.960- 19:16.080* :  authorities leaders doing to stop this? Many of them have promised that they would create jobs
*19:16.080- 19:23.820* :  that they would reduce the prices of footstables or that they would ensure that economic growth
*19:23.820- 19:30.940* :  would take place and from what local immigration experts have told me it seems that young people
*19:30.940- 19:38.460* :  are not willing to wait potentially for years or decades so that they would see the results of
*19:38.460- 19:44.460* :  all those efforts. They feel like their only option is to leave. Kennedy RTC say reporting.
*19:45.180- 19:49.740* :  The latest move against women by the Taliban government of Afghanistan is about their faces,
*19:49.740- 19:55.780* :  body and voices and new law tells them how they must cover up if they're outside and bans women
*19:55.780- 20:01.700* :  from speaking in public. Some Afghan women have responded by posting videos of themselves singing.
*20:11.500- 20:12.680* :  The words include,
*20:13.000- 20:16.600* :  you've imprisoned me inside the house for the crime of being a woman.
*20:17.200- 20:21.560* :  Fawzi Akufi is one of Afghanistan's most prominent female politicians in exile.
*20:22.180- 20:24.840* :  My colleague Michelle Hussain asked what she thought of the new law.
*20:25.520- 20:32.720* :  It's not too surprise of any woman in Afghanistan because already since the Taliban returned
*20:32.720- 20:41.600* :  gradually they have issued 85 edicts to erase a woman from any kind of public sphere education
*20:41.600- 20:48.700* :  work and the last thing women could and I love because it's a tragic love. The last thing they
*20:48.700- 20:55.580* :  wanted to do is to ban women from speaking in public. Now you can imagine if a woman is with
*20:55.580- 20:59.220* :  no male company and if she doesn't have a husband, if she doesn't have a brother, if she doesn't
*20:59.220- 21:06.500* :  have a father and she wants to go out to just buy grocery and get a taxi. How can she talk? A
*21:06.500- 21:10.900* :  woman from Kabul the other day was telling me that she actually waited for half an hour
*21:11.440- 21:16.420* :  to convince a taxi driver to charge her double to take her from one place to the other
*21:17.040- 21:23.100* :  because the taxi driver was scared. So unfortunately this is the last nail in the coffin of
*21:23.100- 21:28.200* :  woman rights in Afghanistan that the Taliban did. Does it mean that essentially women will be
*21:28.200- 21:35.580* :  confined in the home because as you say this affects getting anywhere, shopping, like all sorts
*21:35.580- 21:44.320* :  of activities that were technically still available? Yes, women could still go out to do their
*21:44.620- 21:51.680* :  basic staffs, including visiting friends, families, shopping. And some actually were working
*21:51.680- 22:00.800* :  in discreetly in some NGOs or private companies. Discreetly they were still trying their
*22:00.800- 22:09.860* :  way to work, despite the shrinking space for them. But after this law, and if they start enforcing
*22:09.860- 22:16.140* :  in some provinces, they have the Department of Vice-Emperor to start enforcing it is actually
*22:16.140- 22:22.040* :  basically controlling any move by woman. And what is surprised to me that in a country where,
*22:22.620- 22:27.100* :  according to the UN report, more than 90 percent of the population is under property line.
*22:27.920- 22:35.360* :  Why is the Taliban only, you know, think that by enforcing further and further restrictions
*22:35.360- 22:41.400* :  on women that they can protect Islam? And why is Afghanistan different from the rest of
*22:41.400- 22:48.080* :  Muslim world? In fact, actually they are the one creating Islamophobia and I think it's time for
*22:48.080- 22:53.720* :  the Muslim countries, especially Muslim women around the world, to start, you know, challenging
*22:53.720- 22:59.060* :  these narratives of misrepresentation of Islam by Taliban. What makes the women of Afghanistan
*22:59.060- 23:06.320* :  different from other Muslim women? It's just the patriarchy and the Taliban fair of women getting
*23:06.320- 23:12.880* :  power and they, the Taliban losing power. As Yakufi, one of Afghanistan's most prominent female
*23:12.880- 23:19.280* :  politicians in exile, talking to Michelle Hussain. Japan has issued an emergency warning as a
*23:19.280- 23:25.020* :  powerful typhoon approaches the southwest of the country. The carmaker Toyota has suspended all
*23:25.020- 23:30.920* :  production. Around 800,000 people have been moved to safety from their homes. Asia Pacific
*23:30.920- 23:36.500* :  editor Mickey Bristo is following developments. We're talking about typhoon Shan Shan, which is
*23:36.500- 23:42.560* :  currently sitting menacingly off the southern coast of Japan. That's going to move northwards
*23:42.560- 23:49.460* :  in the next couple of hours, mainland fall, and then via northeast woods and over the next few days
*23:50.060- 23:54.100* :  at its counter-jectory, it looks as though it's going to cross the whole of the Japanese
*23:55.160- 24:02.040* :  land mass. Japanese are saying this is a very strong storm indeed with winds gusting at more
*24:02.040- 24:08.200* :  than 200 kilometers an hour. That's powerful enough to tear down a house, so you get some kind of
*24:08.200- 24:12.840* :  idea of the strength of this storm. Of course, there's going to be torrential rain as well,
*24:12.840- 24:18.020* :  so there's potential for flooding. People along rivers, as you mentioned there, some people have
*24:18.060- 24:23.120* :  already been evacuated and in coastal areas where they're going to be tidal surges, so
*24:23.740- 24:28.740* :  at the moment this storm hasn't hit, but Japan is bracing itself. It's a very densely populated
*24:28.740- 24:35.320* :  country, which makes dealing with this kind of situation even more difficult. Indeed, Japan's
*24:35.320- 24:40.520* :  also, though, used to dealing with natural disasters, including typhoons of this size, and if you
*24:40.520- 24:46.960* :  look at some of the preparations that have already taken place, it just indicates that air travel
*24:46.960- 24:51.360* :  has also been suspended already in some areas, particularly the southwest of the country.
*24:51.920- 24:58.180* :  Bullet trains are running normally at the moment, but over the coming days, as this strong typhoon
*24:58.180- 25:04.340* :  makes ways across Japan, those could be stopped. The authorities are warning people not to drive.
*25:04.340- 25:10.160* :  If it's windy, people have been evacuated. Factories are closing down. Postal delivery services
*25:10.160- 25:15.000* :  have already been suspended, so this is a country used to dealing with natural disasters like this,
*25:15.000- 25:20.360* :  and is already prepared. At the moment, we're not quite sure the course of this typhoon, it might
*25:20.360- 25:24.700* :  veer off, so some of the worst effects might not happen, but if it does, we're going to be talking
*25:24.700- 25:30.640* :  about typhoon Shanshan for the next couple of days. Mickey Bristow reporting. Now to New York,
*25:30.640- 25:35.980* :  where the US Open tennis championships are underway. On Tuesday, history was made on the hard
*25:35.980- 25:40.660* :  court, with Britain's Dan Evans beating the Russian player Karen Hachinov in the tournament's
*25:40.660- 25:45.780* :  longest ever match. But how long was it? Is our tennis correspondent Russell Fuller?
*25:46.540- 25:53.720* :  Five hours and 35 minutes. So the match started at lunchtime. It finished in the early evening.
*25:54.440- 25:59.180* :  Court six has probably never seen anything like it in its life at the US Open, and it was Dan
*25:59.180- 26:05.980* :  Evans, who'd won just four matches on the ATP tour and in Grand Slam's all season, who somehow
*26:05.980- 26:13.280* :  outlasted Karen Hachinov in that final set. Having been four love down, and it looked as if Hachinov
*26:13.280- 26:20.000* :  had taken his legs at that point, but Evans found the second win, and managed to win six four
*26:20.500- 26:27.120* :  in what is the longest match in US Open history by nine minutes, breaking a record that was set 32
*26:27.120- 26:32.820* :  years ago. Both of them looked shattered for probably the last hour and a half of the match, but
*26:32.820- 26:37.780* :  the crowd absolutely loved it. There are growing calls from parents and campaigners around the world
*26:38.160- 26:43.160* :  to limit the amount of time children spend on smartphones, or even ban them from using the
*26:43.160- 26:49.480* :  devices completely. Today in the UK, a new and very pink Barbie branded phone is being launched,
*26:49.480- 26:55.500* :  as our technology editor Zoe Klyman explains, it's not a smartphone. In fact, it's one designed
*26:55.500- 27:01.680* :  to help young people stay away from social media. Barbie, a 65-year-old brand, which was given a
*27:01.680- 27:06.720* :  new lease of life last summer when the star-studded film hits cinemas, is back again.
*27:08.060- 27:12.860* :  This time, it's in the form of a flip phone made by the mobile phone company HMD,
*27:12.860- 27:19.040* :  the same budget brand behind Nokia. It's a feature phone, also sometimes called a dumb phone,
*27:19.360- 27:23.760* :  meaning there's no access to social media, and it can only perform basic functions like
*27:23.760- 27:28.780* :  texting and calling. As concerns about the pressures of digital life on young people grows,
*27:29.220- 27:35.220* :  HMD hopes devices like this might prove popular with children and, indeed, adults looking for a
*27:35.220- 27:40.320* :  digital detox. I asked the firm whether the phone would live up to expectations among young people
*27:40.320- 27:44.920* :  as it tries to compete with smartphones. Lars Silberbauer is its chief marketing officer.
*27:45.160- 27:50.680* :  We are very clear when we say like this phone comes without social media. Because we've seen
*27:50.680- 27:55.100* :  this search in actually young people wanting to have a digital detox, no, this is actually
*27:55.100- 27:58.800* :  delivering on what they're demanding right now. I think when we are talking about Barbie,
*27:59.240- 28:03.880* :  that's also like there's a lot of good values with Barbie. It convinces the parents about like,
*28:03.880- 28:09.060* :  yes, you believe in the brand. I made this my phone for one day, and it certainly was an effective
*28:09.060- 28:14.040* :  digital detox because there really isn't a lot you can do on it. You can get online, but it's
*28:14.040- 28:19.780* :  impossible to read. There's no app store, no front-facing camera, and only one game. And while you
*28:19.780- 28:25.120* :  can text, the Barbie phone doesn't recognise the default message setting that's on plenty of
*28:25.120- 28:31.740* :  smartphones, so you might not get any replies. While this will undoubtedly appeal to some parents,
*28:31.740- 28:37.460* :  there are industry experts who question its broader appeal. Ben Wood is chief analyst at CCS
*28:37.460- 28:42.420* :  Insight. So perhaps in that kind of seven to ten-year-old before you go to secondary school,
*28:42.420- 28:46.440* :  and there's an expectation that smartphones are almost a birthright. That's an opportunity.
*28:47.060- 28:51.920* :  However, the grim reality is when I talk to people who've got smartphones and explain to them
*28:51.920- 28:57.020* :  the implications of giving up their smartphone for something much more basic, it's a pretty tough cell.
*28:57.440- 29:02.360* :  Yeah, I already have TikTok. We decided to put the phone to the test with its key target audience.
*29:02.880- 29:09.000* :  So I'd like if there was things like Google and you could take pictures and more games.
*29:09.780- 29:14.920* :  I probably wouldn't use the phone like that because it doesn't have all the apps that I usually
*29:14.920- 29:20.640* :  like to use. Personally, something that I'm really worried about from my daughter. In terms of
*29:21.160- 29:26.480* :  introducing children to using a phone, we've restricted kind of access to social media and get on
*29:26.480- 29:32.000* :  board with it. HMD says it would welcome apps like WhatsApp on board with Barbie, but WhatsApp says
*29:32.000- 29:37.600* :  not all operating systems work with its service. For now, texting and calling is going to have to be
*29:37.600- 29:41.380* :  enough. Our technology editor Zoe Kleinman reporting.
