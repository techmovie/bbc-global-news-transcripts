*01:31.840- 01:38.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT
*01:38.640- 01:44.300* :  on Friday the 9th of August, these are our main stories. Ukraine expands its incursion into Russia,
*01:44.300- 01:50.100* :  it's hit an airbase in the LePets region. In Thailand, the main opposition party reinvents itself
*01:50.100- 01:57.420* :  two days after being disbanded by the country's top court. Also, this podcast
*01:57.420- 02:03.000* :  supporters of Carlos Puchdemont, who campaigns for independence for Catalonia, says he's on the way
*02:03.000- 02:07.280* :  to Belgium after the Spanish authorities fail to arrest him. And...
*02:07.440- 02:14.200* :  Myself and the entire universe saw an image on social media of a really sad looking in
*02:14.200- 02:21.240* :  Palupa became a symbol of what the hell happened to my life. We have the tale of how a failed
*02:21.240- 02:26.400* :  visitor attraction starring Willy Wonka, Zumba Lumpur's got turned into a musical.
*02:31.360- 02:36.760* :  We start with Ukraine, an update of their incursion into Russian territory, which began on Tuesday.
*02:37.240- 02:41.060* :  A big drone attack has backed up their ground offensive in the Kursk region,
*02:41.060- 02:46.600* :  and there are reports too that they've launched an explosive attack much deeper in Russian territory
*02:47.000- 02:47.720* :  in LePetsk.
*03:01.240- 03:07.620* :  The sound were told by Ukrainian MPs of drones attacking LePetsk airbase. The Ukrainians say there
*03:07.620- 03:12.900* :  were several explosions and a huge fire where dozens of Russian aircraft and warehouses
*03:12.900- 03:18.320* :  storing glide bombs are based. Our correspondent in Kiev, James Waters, gave the details.
*03:19.020- 03:26.120* :  We know that this significant Ukrainian offensive is going into a fourth day, and if Russia was
*03:26.120- 03:31.980* :  hoping it would have been slowed, it doesn't seem to be materializing in that way. We're told
*03:31.980- 03:37.900* :  on the Russian side that 75 drones intercepted overnight. We've heard from the Ukrainian security
*03:37.900- 03:44.420* :  service this side of the border that they successfully targeted a major Russian airbase in LePetsk,
*03:44.560- 03:50.720* :  which is in a neighboring border region, where they say hundreds of glide bombs were stored. They say
*03:50.720- 03:56.080* :  there were fighter jets, they say there were bombers there, and there is footage online appearing to
*03:56.080- 04:02.460* :  show a large fire and explosions, and it's also what Russian military bloggers are reporting to.
*04:02.640- 04:08.380* :  So clearly, Ukraine is looking to extend this quite significant, this audacious counter punch
*04:08.740- 04:12.300* :  from across the border. When for weeks and months, they were concerns that Russia would
*04:12.720- 04:18.180* :  launch an attack the other way. It seems like they've gone around 10 kilometers when you look at
*04:18.180- 04:24.200* :  all the reports added together into Russia. They've seized control of a gas hub, a town called
*04:24.380- 04:29.360* :  Suja. There are conflicting reports there as well as several settlements, and in the short term,
*04:29.420- 04:34.900* :  they seem to be drawing Russian troops for elsewhere, which appears to be Ukraine's goal for now.
*04:35.240- 04:40.300* :  You're calling it audacious. Do you think Ukraine is now bracing itself for a pretty swift Russian
*04:40.300- 04:45.700* :  response to this? You would imagine that would have fallen into Ukrainian calculations here,
*04:45.920- 04:50.600* :  because there is a common sentiment that Ukrainians will tell you, what are they going to do?
*04:50.600- 04:56.300* :  Are they going to invade again? But Vladimir Putin sort of struggled to hide his irritation yesterday
*04:56.300- 05:01.100* :  when he was being briefed by security chiefs. And this cuts to the heart of his almost
*05:01.100- 05:06.500* :  social contract with Russians, who live their lives in places like the Kursk region,
*05:06.500- 05:12.660* :  and they trust in the Kremlin to keep them safe and handle foreign policy. So a major attack
*05:12.660- 05:18.080* :  like this is not a good look for the Kremlin. There are also lots of, I mentioned those
*05:18.080- 05:23.540* :  military bloggers. They are criticizing the military command there for claiming that the situation
*05:23.540- 05:28.520* :  was under control and not acting on intelligence, which suggested that Ukraine is going to carry out
*05:29.200- 05:34.640* :  something like this. So for those reasons, you would imagine that there would be some kind of
*05:34.640- 05:40.340* :  bracing for a response. But I think the hope is that it might slow Russia's gains in the east
*05:40.340- 05:45.720* :  of Ukraine, but looking ahead, it is a fine line between this being a stroke of genius,
*05:46.300- 05:52.000* :  and this being a major miscalculation when you consider Ukraine is already well-outmaned by Russian
*05:52.000- 05:58.100* :  forces. Well, as James said there, the attack on the airfield as part of Ukraine's broader campaign
*05:58.100- 06:03.960* :  into Russia. So let's look now at how the incursion is being viewed by Moscow. Here's our
*06:03.960- 06:09.340* :  Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. Well, I was reading the Russian papers today, and they were really
*06:09.340- 06:13.360* :  interesting. And they keep in mind that most of the Russian papers that are still printed and
*06:13.420- 06:18.600* :  published in this country are controlled by the state. But what comes through, when you read
*06:18.600- 06:25.460* :  these dealers today, is this sort of begrudging recognition by Moscow that Ukraine's cross-border
*06:25.460- 06:30.880* :  attack has been pretty successful so far. So for example, this is a muskowski-cumseable. It's a
*06:30.900- 06:36.260* :  popular tabloid, and it quotes, first of all, from the relatively new Russian defense minister,
*06:36.880- 06:41.760* :  who said that it's okay making mistakes, but you mustn't lie. And the paper says we have to
*06:41.760- 06:47.980* :  recognize that this cross-border assault was a strong move by the Zelensky regime, which has caused
*06:48.280- 06:53.840* :  unpleasant consequences for Russia. And this is another very pro-Kremlin Russian paper,
*06:53.840- 07:00.180* :  Izvestiya. And it says that the enemy, in other words, the Ukrainian army, is acting skillfully
*07:00.240- 07:04.980* :  and daringly, according to all the rules of the art of war. It said it's been using drones
*07:05.020- 07:12.700* :  as air cover for its tactical groups, and then it brought in reserves and battalion tactical
*07:12.700- 07:18.600* :  groups, which have attacked in various parts of Kursk region. And that's quite interesting.
*07:18.660- 07:23.340* :  I think that reflects the realization here in Moscow that it's very difficult to put a positive
*07:23.340- 07:27.600* :  spin on what's been happening in southern Russia over the last four days.
*07:28.060- 07:33.720* :  Steve Rosenberg. Members of Thailand's main opposition party, which was dissolved by a court
*07:33.720- 07:39.480* :  ruling on Wednesday, are regrouping under a new name. 11 leaders of the reformist move forward
*07:39.480- 07:45.100* :  party were also banned from politics for 10 years over their calls to amend the harsh royal
*07:45.100- 07:50.600* :  defamation laws. The party has announced a new leader, a young tech entrepreneur, and its new name
*07:50.600- 07:56.580* :  will be the People's Party. Peter Limjaro-Enrad is the former leader of the move forward party,
*07:56.900- 08:02.740* :  and was their prime ministerial candidate in the 2023 election. He spoke to Andrew Peach about his
*08:02.740- 08:10.000* :  party's dissolution. It's quite disappointing not just to me personally, but also to the country
*08:10.000- 08:17.120* :  as a whole. We're also a constitutional monarchy to the Thai definition, and that definition has
*08:17.120- 08:24.440* :  changed. Obviously, we'll still have to regroup and continue our ideology, our political project.
*08:24.740- 08:33.280* :  But the attempt to dissolve the party is futile, and so it begs the question to the international
*08:33.280- 08:38.380* :  community what kind of democracy Thailand is, whether it's really still a democracy or it's
*08:38.380- 08:47.440* :  gravitating towards a competitive autocracy. It sends the signal space to discuss constructively
*08:47.440- 08:52.960* :  about the relationship between the monarchy and the people is shrinking. Our attempted amendment
*08:52.960- 08:59.300* :  to amend the criminal code inside the parliament where it should be a safe space was not allowed,
*08:59.300- 09:08.300* :  and that equates to insurrection or treason. We wanted to reform the country while I preserving
*09:08.300- 09:15.100* :  the monarchy, and to make sure that the new generation that does not share the same sentiment of
*09:15.100- 09:21.660* :  the era understands the importance of the monarchy, in constitutional monarchy, in a Thai context.
*09:22.460- 09:27.980* :  So what is this new people's party like? Is it any different to what went before? I spoke to
*09:27.980- 09:33.040* :  our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. This is a peculiarity in Thailand that you have
*09:33.040- 09:39.340* :  this system whereby the courts routinely intervene and dissolve parties, a very drastic action
*09:39.340- 09:44.560* :  one that is widely criticised, but they do leave this window open. Thai politics is very fluid,
*09:45.200- 09:49.680* :  and parties are always breaking up and reforming anyway, even if the courts don't intervene.
*09:49.680- 09:56.780* :  And what move forward had to have, and they knew this was likely, was a prepared registered party,
*09:56.780- 10:01.160* :  a little entity, so long as it was registered with the Election Commission, they can all move to
*10:01.160- 10:08.620* :  that party, or any other party if they choose. Interestingly, this time, it seems all 143 MPs have
*10:08.620- 10:13.800* :  chosen to move. The party did unexpectedly well in the last year's election, not all the people
*10:13.800- 10:19.240* :  who are MPs are really hardcore move forward, and there was a fear that some of them could have been
*10:19.240- 10:23.820* :  bribed as this happened in the past to go and defect to other parties, but that has not happened.
*10:24.440- 10:28.680* :  I think there's a realisation that part of the reason they did so well in the last year's
*10:28.680- 10:33.180* :  election was that they do represent a clean break, they're young, they're energetic, they're
*10:33.180- 10:37.820* :  reformist, and anybody who leaves probably wouldn't do very well in the next election. So they will
*10:37.820- 10:41.540* :  carry on and still be the main opposition in parliament. And I think they're quite optimistic.
*10:41.660- 10:46.280* :  You have to remember, this has happened before, move forward itself was a reincarnation of another
*10:46.280- 10:51.900* :  party future forward, which was banned in the year 2000 for different reasons, but essentially by
*10:52.200- 10:56.680* :  by the courts as well with the same kind of climate, and yet the party did much better in the
*10:56.680- 11:01.100* :  subsequent election, even having lost its leaders. So I think they're hopeful that under their
*11:01.100- 11:07.240* :  new leader, a very young tech entrepreneur, a man called Netapong, Ron Panewat, who's been an
*11:07.240- 11:12.160* :  MP since 2019, that they will be able to repeat what they did last year, and the next election in
*11:12.160- 11:17.580* :  three years' time, cash in on that very strong yet hunger for change in Thailand, and the fact that
*11:17.580- 11:23.380* :  they've remained clean and above the normal politics, and perhaps do even better. But in the past,
*11:23.380- 11:28.340* :  as you alluded, we've seen parties regroup, rebrand, do well, and then be blocked from forming
*11:28.340- 11:34.240* :  a government. So can they actually get anywhere? That's a big question, because I mean there's no
*11:34.240- 11:40.100* :  question that they understand now that you can't have any issue even related to the monarchy
*11:40.460- 11:44.960* :  as part of your platform. No matter that people in Thailand appear to want discussion on the monarchy,
*11:44.960- 11:50.160* :  this will not be allowed. The courts are very powerful and can stop this. But they have a lot,
*11:50.220- 11:53.520* :  they have a lot else in their platform. In their previous platform, it was very popular too. They
*11:53.520- 11:57.140* :  want to reform the military. They want to end military service. They want to reform the structure
*11:57.140- 12:02.220* :  of business. They want to reform local administration. And I think it'll be interesting to see if they
*12:02.220- 12:06.940* :  do very well again in three years' time on a quite radical platform that does not touch the monarchy,
*12:06.940- 12:11.220* :  whether the establishment is willing to let them take power or not. That is a big question.
*12:11.480- 12:16.280* :  Not just the courts, but of course the military are always there as a potential intervention in
*12:16.280- 12:22.980* :  Thai politics to undermine the outcomes of democratic elections. Jonathan Head, 10 months on from
*12:22.980- 12:28.420* :  the 7th October attacks on Israel and its subsequent assault on Gaza, the pressure is on again
*12:28.420- 12:33.920* :  for negotiations on a ceasefire to end the war in the Palestinian territory. It's the three
*12:33.920- 12:39.060* :  phased deal outlined by President Biden in late May and endorsed by the Security Council.
*12:39.660- 12:45.060* :  Israel has agreed to send delegates to talks in Qatar or Egypt. Hamas has yet to respond.
*12:45.700- 12:49.860* :  It comes following the recent assassination of a Hamas leader in Iran and further
*12:49.860- 12:55.320* :  attacks on schools in Gaza. Hany Amadun is the director of philanthropy for the UN
*12:55.320- 13:00.880* :  Agency for Palestinian Refugees Anwar. He told us he's skeptical and agreement can be reached.
*13:01.640- 13:06.560* :  My heart tells me, you know, I should be always be optimistic. I just find this a challenge. I
*13:06.640- 13:10.920* :  believe it when I see it. There's been a lot of talks since April about the serious push for a
*13:10.920- 13:15.340* :  ceasefire. It's not very complicated, but it seems that there's a lack of political will.
*13:15.340- 13:19.900* :  Unfortunately, every day passes, every hour passes, more Palestinians are either
*13:19.900- 13:24.440* :  did by the bomb or did by starvation. And that's the reality we see in Gaza every day.
*13:25.200- 13:30.440* :  So, is there any chance of reaching a deal? A correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolana Nell,
*13:30.440- 13:35.100* :  Toby, what's happening? Certainly, the Israelis came out very quickly,
*13:35.100- 13:40.220* :  the Prime Minister's office saying that they would attend. We're yet to hear from Hamas.
*13:40.220- 13:45.300* :  We had expected that the assassination of Ismail Haneer would really at least temporarily
*13:45.300- 13:52.100* :  halt the talks. He had been overseeing the Hamas side of things, but it's not been expected
*13:52.100- 13:56.760* :  that they would stop altogether because of his absence. In fact, Hamas officials have been
*13:56.760- 14:03.160* :  sort of stressing previously that Khalil Alhaya, who was the kind of leading the five member
*14:03.160- 14:10.680* :  negotiating team that he remains ready to do his job. We've had them saying that the replacement
*14:10.680- 14:18.300* :  of Ismail Haneer with a more extreme leader, Yahya Sinwar, it still doesn't fundamentally change
*14:18.300- 14:25.060* :  the way they see any deal, and that up to now all previous declarations on a ceasefire
*14:25.060- 14:30.200* :  and hostage release deal that Hamas had signed up to had been approved by Yahya Sinwar.
*14:30.320- 14:34.080* :  There's a lot going on, of course, here in the background. I mean, they do seem to have been
*14:34.080- 14:38.740* :  saying at the end of July that they felt that they were close to a deal, and I mean, the US is
*14:38.740- 14:45.500* :  going very close now to the time of the presidential election campaign. It would really like to focus
*14:45.500- 14:51.920* :  on that, and all that's happened in the last week or so has really underlined the danger
*14:51.920- 14:58.200* :  in the Middle East of the Gaza War. We're at this dangerous juncture of a bigger regional war,
*14:58.600- 15:03.220* :  and we've had international diplomats saying repeatedly in the past week that if only
*15:03.220- 15:08.260* :  they could be a ceasefire in Gaza, that would really calm down the entire region.
*15:08.880- 15:15.400* :  Yolandael, the accelerating spread of MPOX, previously known as monkeypox, is causing concern.
*15:15.400- 15:21.740* :  The viral infection that can cause a painful rash in large lymph nodes and fever is expected
*15:21.740- 15:26.500* :  to be made a public health emergency by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
*15:26.500- 15:32.420* :  next week. It will be the first time the continental public health agency declares this level of alert.
*15:33.180- 15:37.960* :  Our Africa Health correspondent, Dorcas Wangira, told the BBC's Andrew Peach about the disease.
*15:39.020- 15:44.320* :  MPOX has been in the African continent for decades. The DRC, most specifically,
*15:44.320- 15:51.040* :  there are over 15,000 cases that have been reported this year, 96% of them are in the DRC alone,
*15:51.680- 15:55.860* :  but what we are seeing is that MPOX is spreading to countries it has never spread before.
*15:56.380- 16:01.560* :  Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi have reported cases for the very first time,
*16:02.160- 16:09.300* :  and declaring it a public health emergency of continental security. What does that mean?
*16:09.300- 16:13.080* :  And what does it change? In essence, it's just raising the alert,
*16:13.080- 16:18.460* :  sounding the alarm that this is an emergency. And I must say that usually the Wild Health
*16:18.460- 16:24.220* :  Organization, WTO, declares a public health emergency of international concern. It's known as fake.
*16:24.220- 16:29.560* :  That's the highest level of alert. So in short, this means that Africa CDC doesn't have to wait
*16:29.560- 16:36.740* :  for WTO to declare MPOX and emergency first. So it raises a flag, but what does that lead to?
*16:37.120- 16:42.360* :  So what we will expect to see in the coming week is first, the heads of state of Africa will
*16:42.360- 16:47.020* :  meet for an extraordinary summit to hear from Africa CDC what needs to be done.
*16:47.400- 16:51.840* :  There are four causes of action that are very important. One, there's that international
*16:51.840- 16:58.880* :  notification, resources, resources, resources. Africa needs money to buy vaccines. We also need money
*16:58.880- 17:04.580* :  for contact tracing and the treatment. And then also we are talking about bringing support
*17:04.580- 17:09.960* :  between countries because if it is spreading across borders, it's not just one country's problem.
*17:10.060- 17:15.400* :  Obviously, the fear is that it spreads more and more and more, it makes more people unwell.
*17:15.400- 17:21.320* :  Is it deadly? So that's an important question. MPOX has two clades or more variants,
*17:21.320- 17:27.400* :  so to say there's the first clade one and clade two. But clade one was associated with people
*17:27.400- 17:33.140* :  eating bush meat mostly in West Africa and Central Africa. But what was seen with clade two was
*17:33.140- 17:38.540* :  spreading more through sexual contact. However, the virus, just like many other viruses,
*17:38.540- 17:44.620* :  changing so to say. So the clade one B is what is concerning because you're seeing more people
*17:44.620- 17:49.900* :  getting it. And also you're seeing people having, even after the the heal, it's a virus,
*17:49.900- 17:52.780* :  it heals on its own. They're still having some complications.
*18:17.940- 18:23.620* :  I'm Katrina Perry from the Global Story Podcast. Kamala Harris announces her running mate,
*18:23.620- 18:28.680* :  Minnesota Governor Tim Walls. But do the vice presidential candidates really influence the
*18:28.680- 18:33.820* :  election? And how will Tim Walls and JD Vance impact the final months of the race?
*18:35.060- 18:39.880* :  The Global Story brings you unique perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.
*18:40.460- 18:42.440* :  Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:48.760- 18:51.840* :  Where is the Catalan separatously dirt Carlos Pujdemon?
*18:52.200- 18:56.080* :  Police in Spain have been looking for him since he made a surprise return to the country on
*18:56.080- 19:01.140* :  Thursday, then disappeared. And in a news conference, regional police chiefs vow to keep
*19:01.140- 19:06.560* :  looking for him until they have evidence he is elsewhere. Sources close to Mr Pujdemon have
*19:06.560- 19:11.100* :  suggested he's now returning to Belgium, where he's been living in exile. Danny Eberhardt,
*19:11.100- 19:17.140* :  Tommy Moore. One of the judges at the Spain Supreme Court, he is the person who has been leading
*19:17.140- 19:24.140* :  attempts to bring Carlos Pujdemon to court over many years. And he's also the one who says that
*19:24.140- 19:30.760* :  the Carlos Pujdemon still faces a charge of having embezzled public money in organizing a failed
*19:30.760- 19:36.500* :  independence bid in 2017. So he wants to know from the Spanish interior ministry why they
*19:36.500- 19:40.960* :  failed to stop him at the border. And he wants to know from the Catalan police why they failed to
*19:40.960- 19:46.560* :  arrest him yesterday. What you have in Catalonia, there's a lot of fallout, a lot of embarrassment,
*19:46.580- 19:51.740* :  obviously, that there was this man who's got an arrest warrant out for him, who appeared in
*19:51.740- 19:59.040* :  public in a big crowd in Barcelona and then managed to disappear. So the Catalan police and the
*19:59.040- 20:03.640* :  Catalan regional government have been giving a press conference. They've explained that
*20:03.640- 20:09.860* :  basically they had a complex policing operation yesterday. This visit happened at the same time
*20:09.860- 20:15.420* :  as an investor in Parliament, a vote of an investor for a new head of the Catalan regional
*20:15.420- 20:20.740* :  government. And they're saying that the priority was to preserve that and public order,
*20:21.160- 20:25.080* :  as well as arrest Carlos Pujdemon. They've acknowledged that they failed in that.
*20:25.540- 20:30.540* :  And one of the policemen have said that it's affected the credibility of the local police,
*20:31.020- 20:36.720* :  but one of the politicians there said it was disproportionate and unfair, the amount of blame
*20:36.720- 20:42.180* :  they've been getting. We have a son, he's now going to Belgium. Well, this is according to people,
*20:42.180- 20:48.480* :  his lawyer and the general secretary of the party that he heads. Now Belgium is the place where he
*20:48.480- 20:54.800* :  spent most of the nearly seven years he spent in exile. So it would be a logical thing, obviously not
*20:54.800- 21:00.260* :  everything that this party has been telling us over recent days has always proved to be true.
*21:00.260- 21:06.260* :  There's been a certain amount of deliberate disinformation about the visit, but so it may well
*21:06.260- 21:12.920* :  be that we, until we see him in Belgium and he will no doubt appear to address this thing,
*21:12.920- 21:17.860* :  because in many ways it's been a real coup for Pujdemon and has really put the issue of independence
*21:17.860- 21:23.440* :  back on the agenda. Daniel Bajard, to Bangladesh now and it's the first full day for its new
*21:23.440- 21:28.980* :  interim leader, Professor Mohamed Yunus, a man known for his groundbreaking work on small loans
*21:28.980- 21:33.900* :  to people in poverty. Student protests were key to forcing the former leader, Sheikh Hasina,
*21:33.900- 21:39.560* :  to resign and to flee to India. Her son, Sanjeeb Joy, says she'll return to Bangladesh,
*21:39.560- 21:44.600* :  the moment the interim government decides to hold an election. But when might that be?
*21:44.700- 21:50.760* :  Well, our South Asia correspondent, Samira Hussein, brought some students together in DACA to find out
*21:51.040- 21:58.180* :  what their demands are now. I'm standing underneath a statue that commemorates a people's
*21:58.180- 22:05.560* :  uprising against a military government back in the 90s. And I'm standing here with some
*22:05.560- 22:11.400* :  university students that participated in this particular uprising that led to the overthrow
*22:11.400- 22:18.240* :  of the Hasina government. I'm going to start with you, Ahtar. Can you tell me why you participated
*22:18.300- 22:25.340* :  in those protests? The students of Bangladesh started to raise their voice against a
*22:25.480- 22:31.540* :  photo discrimination in public services and we successfully attained our demand.
*22:32.600- 22:41.520* :  One of the other demands was to have Nobel laureate Mohamed Yunus lead this interim government.
*22:41.580- 22:47.300* :  Why was that important to you, Unic? His achievements can take Bangladesh to a new level.
*22:47.540- 22:50.760* :  Do you think he'll be able to bring democracy to Bangladesh?
*22:50.760- 22:55.920* :  We want a functional democracy that was missing in last 15 years. We want to cast our votes
*22:56.200- 23:00.600* :  and we think that Dr. Yunus is the only guy right now is the capable of bringing this to us.
*23:00.900- 23:05.820* :  So Dr. Yunus has the capacity, experience, knowledge and a full team basically.
*23:06.120- 23:14.220* :  Now Mr. Yunus is leading a team of people. That team is made up of lawyers, academics,
*23:15.000- 23:19.560* :  people from the business and economic world. What happens now?
*23:19.880- 23:23.720* :  Basically, there are three things that we want. Number one priority is that he must bring
*23:23.720- 23:27.400* :  low and low in the place. As there is no government, now the police is working basically
*23:27.400- 23:30.860* :  the law of government is volatile situation. We are seeing a volatile situation in Bangladesh.
*23:31.180- 23:36.780* :  Second is basically Dr. Yunus needs to bring democracy in the institutions. This is what the
*23:37.000- 23:40.940* :  primary demand is. And by bringing democracy within six to eight months, we demanded general
*23:40.940- 23:45.460* :  election. As the interim government is not directly elected, we will come in but he can't stay
*23:45.460- 23:52.080* :  two or three years basically. He is unelected and he must ensure that the institutions are
*23:52.280- 23:56.440* :  democratically functioning. He must ensure a free and fair election within six and eight months.
*23:56.440- 23:59.940* :  This is what these three things are basically our demands, public demands that must be for demands.
*24:00.340- 24:05.240* :  The military is a powerful force in the country. They are also power hungry.
*24:05.920- 24:12.800* :  How will Mr. Yunus and his colleagues be able to manage the demands or the desires of the military?
*24:13.800- 24:19.260* :  The military government cannot be in power because that would be huge chaos.
*24:19.300- 24:25.780* :  Because whenever military comes to power, the nation goes very much problems.
*24:25.780- 24:32.860* :  So we students will help Dr. Yunus to keep his authority in his hand and keep
*24:32.860- 24:36.560* :  democratic in his hand. One final question for all three of you.
*24:37.240- 24:44.780* :  How hopeful are you for Bangladesh's future? We are very much hopeful. We are waiting for a bitter
*24:44.780- 24:50.800* :  Bangladesh. We are waiting for a democratic Bangladesh. I'm highly hopeful and I'm counting on the
*24:51.060- 24:56.200* :  under Dr. Yunus. We are of course hopeful, but there are some things that we need to understand.
*24:56.200- 24:59.640* :  If this government stays two or three years, this will be a problem. But if this government stays
*24:59.640- 25:03.300* :  six to eight months and if it ensures what the three demands we have made,
*25:03.300- 25:08.640* :  then it will be a democratic inclusive Bangladesh. Abdullah, Anik, after. Thank you so much for your time.
*25:08.820- 25:09.560* :  There was no problem.
*25:11.380- 25:16.700* :  BBC South Asia correspondent Samir Hussain. In Ghana, gold is big business.
*25:16.700- 25:22.560* :  It's the West African country's largest export. But not a single ounce is exported in processed
*25:22.560- 25:28.640* :  form. That all changed on Thursday after Ghana's first commercial gold refinery was opened in the
*25:28.640- 25:34.880* :  capital Accra, the newsrooms Elebignal report. Ghana has been going for gold for centuries.
*25:34.880- 25:40.780* :  Before its independence from Britain in 1957, Ghana was called the gold coast.
*25:40.780- 25:47.260* :  An archaeologist have found evidence of gold mining as early as fourth century BC. However,
*25:47.260- 25:52.840* :  despite that long history, the countries had no way to refine the precious metal until now.
*25:53.080- 26:00.480* :  The refinery, which we are commissioning today, will offer premium to gold exported from Ghana,
*26:00.480- 26:08.900* :  and enabling us to refine to 24 carats. That is 99.99 percent purity.
*26:09.320- 26:14.400* :  That's Vice President Muha Moodu Baumir on Thursday he opened Ghana's first commercial
*26:14.400- 26:20.240* :  gold refinery in Accra. Now only through the gold refining process can the metal be measured,
*26:20.240- 26:26.840* :  value and remolded into things like coins, billion bars and jewelry. Mr Baumir says it's meant
*26:26.840- 26:33.240* :  years of missed economic potential. Currently, our country's gold is exported in
*26:33.240- 26:41.840* :  Dory form to be refined outside Ghana. Resulting in lost revenue and missed opportunities for job
*26:41.840- 26:47.860* :  creation. The Royal Ghana gold refinery plans to process up to 400 kilograms a day.
*26:47.860- 26:55.300* :  For Osar Giafou, Amotea Afuri Panin, whose ruled eastern Ghana's Agam tribe, this is a breakthrough.
*26:55.340- 27:00.980* :  If we don't own our resources, we will never be able to achieve what we want to achieve.
*27:00.980- 27:07.600* :  We're poor because we were exploited. So when I got here and listened to all the speakers,
*27:08.600- 27:16.240* :  I just took a big sigh for leave and said, finally, finally we're here. However,
*27:16.240- 27:21.380* :  campaigners, including human rights watch, have raised concerns about Ghana's gold industry,
*27:21.380- 27:26.480* :  particularly its reliance on child labour and the environmental damage it causes.
*27:26.540- 27:34.100* :  A 2021 BBC investigation found 60% of Ghana's water bodies are now polluted, largely due to
*27:34.100- 27:40.100* :  illegal mining activities. But the government says the refinery will help contain illegal practices,
*27:40.680- 27:45.880* :  including gold smuggling, as well as create jobs and ensure Ghana's economic growth.
*27:48.220- 27:52.960* :  And finally, a Willy Wonka-themed family event based on the role, Dahl Book, Charlie,
*27:52.960- 27:57.880* :  and the Chocolate Factory, which became a social media sensation for all the wrong reasons,
*27:57.880- 28:02.780* :  has inspired several shows at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland.
*28:02.780- 28:09.620* :  The disastrous event in Glasgow left visitors pretty disappointed and led to a meme going viral.
*28:09.620- 28:15.060* :  Our media and arts correspondent David Sylato has been to the Scottish Capital to find out more.
*28:20.700- 28:26.300* :  Edinburgh and welcome to the Fringe. My show is called Little Beast Savoy!
*28:27.200- 28:33.040* :  And this is Willy Wonka and the Doctor Factory. There's also a Wonka Magic show and two Wonka
*28:33.040- 28:38.600* :  musicals. There's a lot of Willy Wonka here. I think it's a Glasgow situation.
*28:40.660- 28:46.320* :  Glasgow, you may remember it, the gloriously disappointing Wonka chocolate experience.
*28:47.120- 28:52.220* :  The images went around the world, especially the one of a very sad, umpulumpa,
*28:52.980- 28:56.200* :  which inspired an American producer, Richard Kraft.
*28:57.660- 29:02.600* :  So what is this show you doing? Okay, so what it is is myself and the entire
*29:02.600- 29:08.480* :  universe saw an image on social media of a really sad looking umpulumpa.
*29:08.820- 29:15.940* :  The sad umpulumpa, in a way, became a symbol around the world of what the hell happened to my life.
*29:17.020- 29:21.360* :  And so since I kept asking the question, what's going on in that girl's head,
*29:21.360- 29:25.600* :  I thought there's only one way to answer what's going on in someone's head.
*29:26.000- 29:29.620* :  It's a musical. A musical, of course. What else would it be? A musical.
*29:30.520- 29:34.340* :  Are you mad? Are you mad? I'm worried for you. I'm worried for you.
*29:34.560- 29:39.660* :  Willy is grand opening. But he's done it. And the star of the show?
*29:41.680- 29:44.000* :  Yes, it's the sad umpulumpa herself.
*29:44.040- 29:45.980* :  You're imagining it, you're imagining it.
*29:46.680- 29:50.300* :  It was a disaster. It's as bad as what they say it was, how it ended.
*29:50.920- 29:55.180* :  But I was the last one standing, given out the jelly beans, and the exact time we
*29:55.180- 29:59.600* :  took the picture to be fair was when I was seriously contemplating my life being like,
*30:00.860- 30:02.600* :  maybe I should just go and do something else.
*30:05.480- 30:10.500* :  It feels like a dream come true. I mean, I don't think a lot of people can say they have a musical
*30:10.500- 30:13.580* :  wrote about them. She can't have one. Who says I can't?
*30:13.980- 30:15.520* :  I'm with a funny hat. I want one.
*30:16.180- 30:21.580* :  And to add to it all, there's even a star appearance from the Willy Wonka movie from 1971,
*30:22.520- 30:24.480* :  the original Faruca Salt.
*30:25.780- 30:29.000* :  Faruca, you are terrible. I was. Thank you so much.
*30:29.940- 30:33.140* :  Don't care how I want it now.
*30:35.080- 30:40.200* :  Faruca has haunted me in a good way. You know, I wasn't quite the sad umpulumpa meme,
*30:40.220- 30:44.280* :  but I have been a meme for many, many women. I want it now.
*30:45.280- 30:49.380* :  So how many days rehearsals have you had? So far, one. One. One.
*30:50.380- 30:54.720* :  Hmm, David Sylitor reporting there from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
*30:57.280- 31:00.840* :  That's it for us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*31:37.680- 31:42.260* :  mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls. But do the vice presidential candidates really
*31:42.260- 31:48.140* :  influence the election? And how will Tim Walls and JD Vance impact the final months of the race?
