*00:47.840- 00:50.680* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation,
*00:50.740- 00:52.900* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*00:53.340- 00:55.900* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,
*00:55.920- 00:57.160* :  which is apparently a thing.

*01:19.180- 01:23.300* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.580- 01:28.060* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and in the early hours of Friday,
*01:28.060- 01:30.880* :  the 23rd of August, these are our main stories.
*01:31.220- 01:34.800* :  Kamala Harris is to make the most important speech of her career,
*01:35.680- 01:38.080* :  accepting the presidential nomination of her party
*01:38.480- 01:40.340* :  at the Democratic National Convention.
*01:40.980- 01:43.160* :  The ousted Bangladesh leader, Sheikh Hasina,
*01:43.160- 01:45.480* :  has her diplomatic passport revoked.
*01:45.940- 01:48.100* :  The social media influencer, Andrew Tate,
*01:48.340- 01:50.360* :  is placed under house arrest in Romania
*01:50.740- 01:53.060* :  over new sex trafficking allegations.
*01:55.660- 01:58.360* :  Also in this podcast, Russians mark flag day
*01:58.620- 02:00.460* :  to much pomp and ceremony.
*02:00.840- 02:01.320* :  And...
*02:01.380- 02:04.320* :  Trinbegonians have sort of been split on the announcement
*02:04.320- 02:07.680* :  to remove the three ships that Columbus came with here
*02:08.100- 02:10.480* :  to Trinidad and Tobago from the Cotervaums,
*02:10.480- 02:11.280* :  the National Emblem.
*02:11.780- 02:15.120* :  Trinidad and Tobago redraws its Cotervaums
*02:15.200- 02:18.980* :  to remove references to colonization by Europeans.
*02:23.220- 02:25.140* :  A few hours after we record this podcast,
*02:25.680- 02:27.260* :  Kamala Harris, the woman hoping to become
*02:27.260- 02:30.140* :  the first female president of the United States,
*02:30.760- 02:33.240* :  will deliver the most important speech of her career
*02:33.240- 02:37.040* :  as the finale of the Democratic Convention in Chicago.
*02:37.960- 02:40.020* :  Since President Biden withdrew from the race
*02:40.020- 02:42.280* :  and endorsed her, hundreds of millions of dollars
*02:42.280- 02:44.720* :  have poured into the Harris campaign.
*02:45.380- 02:47.240* :  There's been an almost carnival like atmosphere
*02:47.240- 02:50.180* :  at the convention, where speeches have been given
*02:50.260- 02:53.800* :  by running mate Tim Walls, former President Barack Obama,
*02:53.800- 02:56.300* :  his wife Michelle, and Oprah Winfrey.
*02:56.800- 02:59.920* :  So, can Kamala Harris continue to sustain
*02:59.920- 03:02.240* :  the momentum she appears to have built up?
*03:02.780- 03:06.140* :  This is the Democratic Senator for Maryland, Chris Van Hollen.
*03:06.540- 03:07.360* :  Yes, she can.
*03:07.360- 03:11.380* :  I believe she came into this convention with a lot of momentum,
*03:11.380- 03:15.580* :  and that momentum has only grown over these four days.
*03:15.580- 03:18.080* :  As everybody has said, the key is, of course,
*03:18.260- 03:21.320* :  to convert that energy into votes.
*03:21.760- 03:24.840* :  But I can see just from talking to people
*03:24.840- 03:26.940* :  in my state of Maryland and around the country,
*03:27.560- 03:28.460* :  especially younger voters,
*03:28.460- 03:31.360* :  they're very excited, very motivated to get out.
*03:31.420- 03:34.000* :  So, I don't think this is just a sugar high.
*03:34.000- 03:35.220* :  I think this is sustainable.
*03:36.000- 03:38.660* :  Our correspondent, Ioni Wells, is at the convention.
*03:38.960- 03:42.380* :  So, what message is Kamala Harris expected to give?
*03:43.120- 03:45.200* :  She's expected, I think, firstly to tell a bit
*03:45.200- 03:46.740* :  about her own personal story.
*03:46.740- 03:48.540* :  I think the speeches really have this convention
*03:48.540- 03:49.500* :  have been pretty personal.
*03:49.500- 03:51.960* :  I think she'll want to particularly highlight her upbringing.
*03:52.540- 03:55.100* :  She was somebody who went to school.
*03:55.520- 03:57.740* :  She was essentially sort of busts from her neighborhood
*03:57.740- 03:59.400* :  that was a sort of lower middle class,
*03:59.400- 04:01.460* :  predominantly black neighborhood, to a more affluent,
*04:02.020- 04:04.600* :  wider neighborhood as part of a program at the time
*04:04.600- 04:06.240* :  to make schools more integrated.
*04:06.260- 04:09.420* :  She went on to then be one of the country's top prosecutors.
*04:09.420- 04:12.240* :  So, I think she will want to sort of tell her own story
*04:12.260- 04:14.260* :  of aspiration about how she understands
*04:14.260- 04:16.420* :  how she struggles for many middle class Americans.
*04:17.260- 04:19.240* :  And I think try and sort of frame herself as somebody
*04:20.260- 04:21.280* :  who is, yeah, on the side of working people
*04:22.260- 04:24.420* :  versus Donald Trump, who she will probably argue
*04:24.420- 04:27.280* :  is on the side of the rich in terms of sort of some
*04:27.280- 04:29.800* :  of the tax cuts, for example, that he's previously talked about
*04:30.260- 04:31.300* :  when it comes to the wealthy.
*04:32.260- 04:34.940* :  I think she will also want to talk a lot about freedoms,
*04:35.260- 04:37.040* :  particularly some of the freedoms her campaign
*04:37.260- 04:39.620* :  have been specifically highlighting that they will be fighting
*04:40.260- 04:42.200* :  for things like reproductive rights, abortion rights,
*04:43.300- 04:45.580* :  for everybody, no matter their background.
*04:46.440- 04:48.720* :  And I think those kind of things will be really key to her speech.
*04:48.720- 04:51.860* :  I think also, finally, we will expect to hear a sort
*04:51.860- 04:54.840* :  of solid dose of patriotism, of love for her country.
*04:54.840- 04:58.540* :  I think she'll want to be careful not to alienate Republican voters,
*04:58.540- 05:02.600* :  even if she is going on the attack of Donald Trump himself.
*05:02.600- 05:05.180* :  And that's partly because we know that the selection
*05:05.240- 05:09.120* :  is going to be one or loss in some really key swing states.
*05:09.360- 05:10.940* :  And she will have a challenge on her hands,
*05:10.940- 05:14.460* :  try and convince some people who would maybe traditionally vote Republican
*05:15.000- 05:17.640* :  to perhaps consider voting for her this time around.
*05:17.740- 05:20.440* :  Yes, because the race is still very tight, isn't it?
*05:20.640- 05:21.900* :  That's right, it's extremely tight.
*05:22.160- 05:23.880* :  And it's easy when you're somewhere like this,
*05:23.880- 05:25.520* :  where I'm in Chicago at this convention,
*05:25.600- 05:28.840* :  where you're surrounded by die-hard loyal fans
*05:28.840- 05:30.580* :  of the party of Kamala Harris,
*05:30.920- 05:33.920* :  to see a lot of the momentum behind her, which is definitely there.
*05:34.420- 05:36.840* :  But I think it is important to remember that the polls do suggest
*05:36.840- 05:38.340* :  this is incredibly tight still.
*05:38.340- 05:41.640* :  And I think the party are aware that there isn't room to be complacent.
*05:42.040- 05:42.760* :  I only wells.
*05:43.400- 05:45.180* :  Well, just a few weeks ago, some Democrats
*05:45.200- 05:48.060* :  doubted whether Kamala Harris should be appointed
*05:48.060- 05:51.980* :  as the party's presidential candidate without any competition.
*05:52.680- 05:55.920* :  Jerusalem Demsas is a staff writer at the Atlantic,
*05:56.400- 05:58.120* :  who worked on Kamala Harris' campaign
*05:58.120- 06:01.520* :  to become the presidential nominee back in 2020.
*06:01.600- 06:05.940* :  She wrote recently, she didn't think Harris was the strongest choice
*06:06.320- 06:07.680* :  to defeat Donald Trump.
*06:08.360- 06:11.640* :  Paul Henry asked Jerusalem Demsas if she'd changed her mind.
*06:12.420- 06:13.880* :  I think that it's not knowable,
*06:13.880- 06:17.160* :  because the way that you figure out whether or not someone is the strongest candidate
*06:17.160- 06:18.540* :  is you have a primary process.
*06:18.540- 06:20.660* :  That's the way the American political system works,
*06:20.660- 06:22.840* :  is that we have that process in which you figure out
*06:22.840- 06:24.400* :  you're able to vet candidates fully,
*06:24.400- 06:28.720* :  and those people, their views, whether they have they stand in the party,
*06:28.760- 06:31.160* :  what kinds of coalitions are able to coalesce around.
*06:31.160- 06:34.180* :  So that sort of thing is really unknowable in this election
*06:34.240- 06:36.460* :  because we do not have that kind of a process.
*06:36.880- 06:39.020* :  I think it's clear right now that Harris has been able to consolidate
*06:39.020- 06:42.940* :  a ton of democratic support behind her in a way that many people,
*06:43.300- 06:44.780* :  including myself, were not expecting.
*06:45.640- 06:47.940* :  But I think that fundamental question of whether there were other candidates
*06:47.960- 06:50.160* :  that could have done that, that could have been stronger,
*06:50.160- 06:52.160* :  that maybe could have brought in other coalitions.
*06:52.160- 06:53.560* :  That sort of thing, something we're going to have to,
*06:53.560- 06:56.020* :  you know, will be left to historians try to figure out.
*06:56.200- 06:59.840* :  Well, what we're witnessing now at the convention is a full-on coronation,
*07:00.020- 07:01.060* :  just what you didn't want.
*07:01.100- 07:04.720* :  I mean, my article argued that Democrats should have a real debate
*07:04.720- 07:07.700* :  about who should be the next candidate, and right now they're coalescing
*07:07.700- 07:08.700* :  around Kamala Harris.
*07:09.100- 07:13.080* :  I still believe that there was a moment for the Democrats to have a real debate,
*07:13.080- 07:16.200* :  and one of the benefits of having a primary is that you actually have
*07:16.200- 07:19.360* :  the democratic process figure out whether or not someone,
*07:19.360- 07:22.680* :  what kinds of views the end of individual has.
*07:23.000- 07:26.880* :  Right now, Harris, you know, she's not had a lot of pressure to take serious interviews.
*07:27.080- 07:30.940* :  This is a candidate who does not really have to reveal a lot about her political
*07:31.180- 07:31.780* :  and policy thinking.
*07:31.780- 07:35.240* :  She's revealed some economic policies last week, but again,
*07:35.360- 07:38.920* :  she's someone who hasn't had a ton of time in national political office.
*07:39.380- 07:42.820* :  And so, you know, I think that a lot of Americans could have benefited
*07:42.820- 07:46.120* :  from a primary process that revealed what she actually believed.
*07:46.120- 07:52.000* :  Do you think that she should be putting ethnic and equality issues higher up the agenda
*07:52.000- 07:53.220* :  than she seems to be?
*07:53.680- 07:57.700* :  I think that the question here is about how those things are emphasized, right?
*07:57.700- 08:01.140* :  I think there's a way of doing identity politics has just been shown to be
*08:01.140- 08:05.140* :  often politically harmful, and I think that this emphasis on, you know,
*08:05.140- 08:08.700* :  you should pick a black woman to do X or you should pick some of this ethnicity
*08:08.700- 08:09.660* :  for whatever reason.
*08:09.660- 08:12.900* :  I think that those things have been on the outs and are not really a great way
*08:12.900- 08:16.360* :  to do governance, but on the question of whether people should, you know,
*08:16.420- 08:20.800* :  attack inequalities that are a function of folks's, you know, race or class
*08:20.800- 08:23.240* :  or ethnic background or nationality.
*08:23.240- 08:26.660* :  I mean, that's obviously central, and I think something that she's focused on
*08:26.660- 08:28.980* :  when she put out her policy proposals on housing last week,
*08:28.980- 08:32.520* :  it was clear that part of her focus is on the homeownership gaps that exist.
*08:32.960- 08:38.220* :  The big argument against Kamala Harris was that she didn't have the necessary polling numbers
*08:38.460- 08:40.120* :  that does seem to be changing, surely.
*08:40.520- 08:43.180* :  She's clearly moving in a positive direction, but I think everyone would say
*08:43.180- 08:46.240* :  I mean, including Jen O'Malley Dillon, who's a, you know, top of the campaign
*08:46.300- 08:48.140* :  that it is a very, very close election.
*08:48.140- 08:51.140* :  She was improving on Biden's bismill standing at the time,
*08:51.180- 08:54.200* :  and that's clear she's able to consolidate a lot of low-hanging fruit
*08:54.220- 08:56.860* :  that I think was available, and that was who's struggling to get.
*08:56.860- 08:59.860* :  But it's a very close election. It's unclear what's going to happen here.
*09:00.000- 09:02.880* :  It remains to be seen whether they're able to win across the swing voters.
*09:02.880- 09:07.060* :  The Trump campaign is working very hard to try to tag her as liberal out of touch,
*09:07.060- 09:09.500* :  but poll numbers still show a very tight race.
*09:10.100- 09:12.880* :  Here's the final one. Do you think she can do it? Will she win?
*09:13.520- 09:14.860* :  I think it is very possible that she will win.
*09:14.860- 09:20.180* :  She's clearly improving on Biden's poll numbers, and Trump is a uniquely vulnerable candidate.
*09:20.180- 09:23.840* :  But it's going to be a close race, and it's going to really depend on what issues are salient.
*09:23.840- 09:28.000* :  Come November, is it going to be issues of immigration and organic issues
*09:28.340- 09:30.200* :  that Republicans are trusted more on?
*09:30.540- 09:32.860* :  Or are they going to be issues that Democrats are trusted more on?
*09:32.860- 09:37.940* :  And is, you know, is Trump going to sink himself if he shows up to this debate
*09:38.260- 09:40.860* :  and the contrast between him and Harris is very negative?
*09:41.420- 09:44.540* :  Jerusalem Demsas, staff writer for The Atlantic.
*09:45.620- 09:49.240* :  In Bangladesh, the interim government says it's revoked the diplomatic passport
*09:49.240- 09:52.140* :  of the country's outside leader, Sheikh Zina.
*09:52.500- 09:56.460* :  The interior ministry said the decision also applied to former members of her government,
*09:56.460- 09:58.340* :  more from ElectroNacement.
*09:59.000- 10:03.460* :  The announcement came from the Security Division Lesson three weeks after huge protest
*10:03.620- 10:05.760* :  forced the long-time leader to flee to India.
*10:06.280- 10:09.920* :  It applies to all members of the former Obama League government, not imposed,
*10:09.920- 10:13.340* :  cabinet members, advisors, MPs and their relatives.
*10:13.960- 10:17.080* :  Diplomatic passports confer special privileges on holders,
*10:17.520- 10:20.020* :  without one they'll need to apply for a standard passport
*10:20.260- 10:21.800* :  and crucially be approved.
*10:21.800- 10:25.100* :  Sheikh Zina's government is accused of widespread abuses,
*10:25.480- 10:27.240* :  including extrajudicial killings.
*10:27.640- 10:29.820* :  She's already the subject of a murder inquiry.
*10:30.920- 10:34.160* :  A judge in Romania has ruled that the social media influencer
*10:34.780- 10:39.140* :  and self-described misogynist Andrew Tate must be kept under house arrest
*10:39.140- 10:44.080* :  while prosecutors investigate new allegations against him and his brother Tristan.
*10:44.580- 10:48.180* :  They've both already been charged with trafficking as part of a separate case.
*10:48.740- 10:51.980* :  A recent Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford reports from Bucharest.
*10:52.760- 10:55.960* :  Andrew Tate came out of court to make a furious statement.
*10:56.440- 10:59.940* :  A judge had just released him from police custody into house arrest.
*11:00.520- 11:05.320* :  The notorious internet personality, whose open misogyny has gained him millions of followers,
*11:05.880- 11:08.740* :  denounced the new investigation he's facing as a setup.
*11:08.740- 11:12.620* :  He called it absolutely disgusting and claimed there was no evidence
*11:12.620- 11:14.340* :  he's involved in human trafficking.
*11:15.300- 11:18.500* :  Today, Romania's serious crime agency announced allegations
*11:18.720- 11:21.780* :  that he and his brother were part of a criminal group,
*11:21.780- 11:25.620* :  grooming women and forcing them to make explicit video content
*11:25.620- 11:27.320* :  and then keeping the proceeds.
*11:28.340- 11:29.940* :  One of the brothers, who's not named,
*11:29.940- 11:32.740* :  is accused of having sex with a 15-year-old.
*11:33.320- 11:37.620* :  Andrew Tate refused to answer questions about that from the BBC outside court.
*11:38.520- 11:42.280* :  Prosecutors say there are 35 alleged victims in their investigation.
*11:42.280- 11:46.240* :  The Tate brothers have already been charged in a separate case of human trafficking
*11:46.800- 11:47.760* :  and are awaiting trial.
*11:48.400- 11:50.460* :  They have always denied any wrongdoing.
*11:51.380- 11:52.160* :  Sarah Reinsford.
*11:53.080- 11:56.420* :  Russia has marked its national flag day with celebrations,
*11:56.960- 12:01.060* :  despite the ongoing Ukrainian incursion into the border region of Kursk.
*12:01.400- 12:04.360* :  It's the first major foreign invasion into Russian territory
*12:04.360- 12:07.760* :  since the Second World War, with dozens of civilians killed
*12:07.760- 12:10.320* :  and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes.
*12:10.960- 12:12.940* :  Ukraine's action took the Kremlin by surprise,
*12:12.940- 12:16.380* :  but as our Russian editor Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow,
*12:16.840- 12:21.520* :  it hasn't stopped Vladimir Putin from commemorating his country's patriotic holiday.
*12:22.260- 12:25.240* :  When Russians celebrate, they don't do things by half.
*12:27.060- 12:29.720* :  At a Moscow war memorial on national flag day,
*12:30.260- 12:33.580* :  a long line of Russian soldiers carried an enormous,
*12:33.580- 12:35.500* :  furled Russian trickleer.
*12:36.300- 12:39.260* :  Unfurled the flag came the order,
*12:39.640- 12:44.100* :  and minutes later, the whole square was awash with white, blue and red.
*12:44.600- 12:47.960* :  But a huge flag cannot cover up huge problems.
*12:48.540- 12:52.280* :  For more than two weeks, Ukrainian troops have been occupying territory
*12:52.780- 12:54.000* :  in Russia's Kursk region.
*12:55.920- 12:59.880* :  After the flag ceremony, Yelena told me that she's terrified by what is happening,
*13:00.520- 13:02.880* :  but Russia, she says, will eventually win,
*13:03.440- 13:05.160* :  and nothing will be left of Ukraine.
*13:07.200- 13:10.940* :  Later, Vladimir Putin wished senior officials happy flag day
*13:10.940- 13:14.660* :  and discussed the situation near the Russia-Ukraine border.
*13:15.280- 13:19.540* :  Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia is a huge challenge to his authority.
*13:19.540- 13:23.280* :  President Putin will be desperate to crush the incursion,
*13:23.880- 13:27.900* :  but he's also keen to avoid any sense of panic in Russian society.
*13:28.480- 13:32.820* :  And so, the authorities here create the image almost of business as usual.
*13:33.480- 13:37.240* :  And yet, in recent days, reports of young Russian conscripts
*13:37.240- 13:41.020* :  being sent to Kursk region has raised alarm in society.
*13:41.020- 13:45.780* :  More than 10,000 people have signed a petition calling on President Putin
*13:45.780- 13:49.800* :  to ensure that conscripts do not take part in the fighting.
*13:50.460- 13:52.380* :  A Russian editor, Steve Rosenberg.
*13:55.160- 13:59.740* :  Still to come, weapons dealers in Yemen use the social media platform X
*13:59.740- 14:05.260* :  to sell guns, and this year, volume of visitors around 4 million people a year
*14:05.260- 14:08.240* :  takes its toll on infrastructure and services.
*14:08.980- 14:13.420* :  So, the city council has voted in favour of a visitor levy or tourist tax.
*14:14.200- 14:18.560* :  The Scottish capital Edinburgh becomes the latest city to charge holidaymakers
*14:18.960- 14:22.800* :  for staying in hotels, B&Bs, and self-catering accommodation.

*15:01.540- 15:02.360* :  No, no, no, no, no.
*15:02.360- 15:03.160* :  No, no.
*15:03.380- 15:06.880* :  You know, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.
*15:07.220- 15:10.240* :  I mean, it's unlimited premium wireless for $15 a month.
*15:10.240- 15:13.420* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*15:13.420- 15:15.520* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*15:15.840- 15:19.960* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.

*15:24.720- 15:25.680* :  Taxes and fees extra.
*15:25.820- 15:27.660* :  Speed slower above 40 gigabyte of CDTales.
*15:31.640- 15:35.640* :  Refugees who fled Ukraine for Hungary could be forced to return home.
*15:36.000- 15:39.100* :  That's according to the United Nations Agency looking after them.
*15:39.640- 15:43.540* :  Hungary has bought in a new law which reduces the number of people from Ukraine.
*15:43.540- 15:45.040* :  It says it will look after.
*15:45.540- 15:52.560* :  And the UNHCR says this means many will have to choose between returning to their war torn country or becoming homeless.
*15:53.120- 15:55.480* :  As our regional editor, Paul Moss reports.
*15:58.200- 16:01.020* :  On a small street in the Hungarian village of Koch,
*16:01.020- 16:04.220* :  the group of women are sitting on the pavement with their children.
*16:04.820- 16:07.520* :  Suitcases scattered haphazardly around them.
*16:08.080- 16:12.520* :  They're waiting, but it's not clear there's anything or any one to wait for.
*16:16.380- 16:19.220* :  They're all refugees who fled the conflict in Ukraine.
*16:19.780- 16:21.940* :  They had found asylum in neighbouring Hungary,
*16:21.940- 16:24.700* :  but Wednesday saw a new law come into force.
*16:25.100- 16:29.080* :  The nationalist government in Hungary said refugees would only be looked after
*16:29.560- 16:33.280* :  if they came from a part of Ukraine directly affected by the war.
*16:33.820- 16:37.220* :  These women and their families apparently didn't match that criteria,
*16:37.780- 16:39.700* :  so they were turfed out of their accommodation.
*16:43.160- 16:47.280* :  We've been sitting here since eight in the morning, but nobody says anything.
*16:47.720- 16:52.380* :  Whether anyone will help us or are we going to sleep out here with the children till the morning?
*16:53.300- 16:54.600* :  I don't know what will happen.
*16:55.180- 16:58.900* :  The agency is looking after refugees in Hungary are equally at a loss.
*16:59.300- 17:02.540* :  Anako Bakony works for the Hungarian Helsinki Committee
*17:03.120- 17:07.400* :  and has been trying to find replacement accommodation for those stranded in Koch village.
*17:08.080- 17:13.540* :  There are many small children here, so this is a very difficult situation for the families.
*17:13.540- 17:17.820* :  And then we are not sure whether they'll be able to spend the night somewhere.
*17:17.820- 17:23.800* :  We try to phone around among the big charities if they have any emergency accommodation
*17:24.060- 17:25.760* :  and they didn't seem to have any.
*17:25.900- 17:30.160* :  So we are not sure how long this situation will go
*17:30.200- 17:32.800* :  and how long this can be kept like this.
*17:33.540- 17:38.080* :  Hungary's government says many refugees there could take jobs, but have refused to
*17:38.460- 17:42.720* :  and that the country is spending nearly $30 million a year looking after people
*17:42.720- 17:44.160* :  who could be earning money.
*17:44.720- 17:49.080* :  But now the European Union has said it will investigate Hungary's new refugee law
*17:49.500- 17:53.980* :  to see if it complies with international obligations which the country has signed up to.
*17:54.560- 17:55.160* :  Paul Moss.
*17:55.880- 18:00.100* :  India's Supreme Court has urged doctors who have been striking over the rape and murder
*18:00.100- 18:04.460* :  of a female colleague and a hospital in the city of Kolkata to return to work.
*18:04.460- 18:09.260* :  At a hearing into the killing, the chief justice said people could not be left in the lurch.
*18:09.780- 18:13.020* :  There have been mass protests across the country led by women's groups
*18:13.360- 18:16.940* :  who are demanding a swift investigation and greater safety in the workplace.
*18:17.640- 18:21.000* :  Rebecca Kessby spoke to our correspondent in Delhi, Semir Hussain.
*18:21.420- 18:26.100* :  The Supreme Court has really urged striking doctors to go back to work
*18:26.120- 18:29.920* :  and they're saying that look, the protests could really have a serious impact
*18:29.920- 18:31.600* :  on the country's health care system.
*18:32.060- 18:38.500* :  It's been almost two weeks since the brutal rape and murder of that 31-year-old female doctor.
*18:39.180- 18:42.840* :  The Supreme Court also said that there shouldn't be any coercive action taken
*18:42.840- 18:45.680* :  against the protesters for their protests so far.
*18:46.020- 18:51.080* :  I think that's a real recognition of the anger that is felt on the streets
*18:51.560- 18:54.940* :  right across the country at what happened to this doctor.
*18:54.940- 19:02.620* :  I think what's really also coming out now is just how unsafe so many female doctors feel
*19:03.220- 19:04.120* :  while they're on the job.
*19:04.620- 19:08.040* :  Yes, I mean, it's really sparked a national mood, hasn't it?
*19:08.040- 19:14.100* :  Lots of people talking more about sexual assault and rape and the problem of it
*19:14.280- 19:15.540* :  within the whole society.
*19:16.440- 19:20.220* :  Yes, and now look, rape is not something that is unique to India.
*19:20.220- 19:23.900* :  There are instances of rape right around the world.
*19:23.960- 19:26.020* :  So, you know, India is not unique in that.
*19:26.020- 19:28.180* :  So I want to be careful and not painting it as such.
*19:28.720- 19:33.220* :  But yes, there is certainly an outcry within the country from women
*19:33.840- 19:37.740* :  that are saying that look, we just don't feel safe in so many areas.
*19:37.740- 19:42.180* :  And I think this is particularly struck a nerve because it is a doctor
*19:42.180- 19:48.220* :  at a government run hospital who was there to work in service of the people.
*19:48.900- 19:53.060* :  And for her to have been so brutally raped and murdered,
*19:53.060- 19:57.640* :  I think that's really why so many people are just so upset about this.
*19:57.800- 20:01.240* :  And there's been a lot of questions as well in terms of how the police
*20:01.240- 20:05.720* :  and the state government of Bengal have been dealing with the situation.
*20:05.720- 20:07.480* :  What happens next with that?
*20:07.980- 20:08.600* :  Well, exactly.
*20:08.640- 20:12.280* :  And so the Supreme Court actually in a lot of what it was saying today,
*20:12.280- 20:18.380* :  you know, they also criticized the investigation saying that authorities took more than an hour
*20:18.900- 20:20.640* :  to coordinate that crime scene.
*20:20.640- 20:23.320* :  So they found the woman's body at about 10, 10 pm.
*20:23.340- 20:27.120* :  But it wasn't until 11.45 pm that they coordinate off the crime scene.
*20:27.120- 20:32.840* :  And so there are all these questions being raised with regards to how the autopsy was conducted
*20:33.340- 20:35.080* :  and how the investigation was conducted.
*20:35.080- 20:37.860* :  And so there have been lots of very pointed questions
*20:38.420- 20:42.120* :  at the authorities running that hospital in Golgata.
*20:42.320- 20:47.020* :  So now that the Supreme Court will hear about this case again next month.
*20:47.560- 20:50.720* :  Very briefly, Samir, the doctor is going back to work when?
*20:51.400- 20:56.220* :  Well, so far we've only heard from doctors at the largest medical institution in Delhi
*20:56.220- 20:59.760* :  and they have said that they are going to call off their 11-day strike
*21:00.000- 21:01.940* :  at the urging of the country's Supreme Court.
*21:01.940- 21:04.500* :  But we haven't heard from any of the other doctors since.
*21:04.980- 21:07.140* :  The BBC is Samir Hussain in Delhi.
*21:08.060- 21:12.800* :  An investigation by the British newspaper The Times has found weapons being openly advertised
*21:12.800- 21:19.120* :  on the social media website X by dozens of Yemeni gun merchants operating in areas controlled
*21:19.120- 21:22.900* :  by the Houthis, a prescribed terrorist group in the United States.
*21:23.580- 21:26.360* :  The BBC has found several examples still online.
*21:26.960- 21:29.880* :  X has been approached for comment but is so far not replied.
*21:29.880- 21:32.520* :  Here's our security correspondent, Frank Gardner.
*21:32.900- 21:35.880* :  The words beside the weapons are designed to lure in the buyers.
*21:35.880- 21:39.620* :  Premium crossmanship and top notch warranties says one advertisement.
*21:40.040- 21:42.960* :  The Yemeni modified AK is your best choice.
*21:42.960- 21:49.180* :  A demonstration video filmed at night shows the seller blasting off a 30-round magazine on full automatic.
*21:49.180- 21:54.660* :  Another office Pakistani produced clock pistols for around 900 US dollars each.
*21:55.020- 21:58.160* :  Yet these advertisements are not hidden in the depths of the dark web.
*21:58.600- 22:03.140* :  They are on X, the mass social media platform previously known as Twitter.
*22:03.260- 22:08.660* :  The sellers who operate in areas of Yemen under control of the Houthis, a prescribed terrorist group
*22:08.660- 22:13.840* :  by the US and Australian governments make no attempt to hide their names or even their locations.
*22:13.840- 22:21.780* :  Some post their priceless in both Yemeni and Saudi Reels, inviting buyers to contact them on other social media platforms.
*22:21.780- 22:27.760* :  An investigation by the times found some of the sellers accounts even had the blue-tick validation.
*22:28.400- 22:31.620* :  X has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.
*22:31.620- 22:39.240* :  Yemen has long been awash with firearms, with many adult males in rural areas regularly walking around with collation coughs
*22:39.240- 22:46.240* :  slung over their shoulders, but following the upheaval of the Arab Spring, a civil war, and a takeover of much of the country
*22:46.260- 22:52.860* :  by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, conditions in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest nation have steadily deteriorated.
*22:53.440- 22:54.160* :  Frank Gardner.
*22:54.800- 23:02.520* :  Scotland's capital Edinburgh is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, around 4 million people a year visit the city,
*23:02.560- 23:05.020* :  particularly during the festival month of August.
*23:05.700- 23:09.580* :  But soon they'll have to pay a visitor tax on top of their accommodation bill.
*23:10.020- 23:16.860* :  Edinburgh City Council has voted for the introduction of the tax, which could generate around $65 million a year.
*23:17.460- 23:19.660* :  A reporter in Edinburgh is Joanne McColley.
*23:19.980- 23:26.000* :  The charge covers hotels, B&B's, self-catering accommodation, and lets through websites such as Airbnb.
*23:27.140- 23:29.840* :  Visitors would be an extra 5% on their bills.
*23:30.600- 23:34.860* :  The leader of Edinburgh City Council, Kamiday, says it's an exciting opportunity.
*23:35.680- 23:40.580* :  We currently propose that there's about 5 million pounds that goes to help with some of the affordable housing in the city.
*23:40.580- 23:47.740* :  That around 50% of the budget is spent on keeping the city in the streets cleaner, tidier, moving graffiti.
*23:47.740- 23:54.760* :  35% or so goes back into the culture and arts organisations who create all this excitement in the city during summertime.
*23:55.920- 24:02.820* :  The scheme is the first of its kind in Scotland, but last year Manchester introduced a £1 per room per night fee,
*24:03.280- 24:06.020* :  aimed at paying for measures to attract more tourists.
*24:06.760- 24:13.100* :  But critics of the Edinburgh scheme say it's overly complicated, and the charge could put people off visiting.
*24:13.680- 24:16.720* :  David Weston is from the Scottish B&B Association.
*24:17.020- 24:25.940* :  On that simple £100 room, we've now got to advertise that at £105, so it'll immediately make a seemer, well be more expensive,
*24:26.620- 24:32.880* :  compared with our competitors in England and other European countries, and that will make it more difficult.
*24:33.100- 24:39.520* :  The draft plans will now go out to a 12 week consultation, a final decision on them will be taken in January,
*24:39.920- 24:43.540* :  and the scheme could come into effect as early as July 2026.
*24:44.280- 24:51.900* :  Joanne McColley, and finally the island of Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean has decided to redraw its coat of arms,
*24:52.300- 24:58.340* :  and replace explorer Christopher Columbus's three ships with its national percussion instrument, the Steel Pan.
*24:58.340- 25:02.020* :  It's part of a move to get rid of references to its colonial history.
*25:02.600- 25:10.600* :  The island will hold a public hearing on whether certain statues, signs and monuments with colonial connections should also be removed.
*25:11.280- 25:14.640* :  The issue is causing a heated debate as we heard from two residents.
*25:15.500- 25:22.920* :  These three ships and the team of people didn't discover Trinidad, they didn't discover the Caribbean.
*25:23.440- 25:26.760* :  They were already people living here, they were already cultures living here.
*25:27.360- 25:42.000* :  What those three ships brought to Trinidad in particular was the rape, the plundering, the destruction of diversity, of culture, of ways of life,
*25:42.760- 25:47.880* :  of interacting with nature, things that we recognize are so important today.
*25:48.520- 25:58.940* :  Those ships and those that followed have no place on anything to remind anyone the history behind what those three ships actually represented, actually did.
*25:59.500- 26:04.420* :  So this country isn't told on a coat of arms, so they shouldn't be there.
*26:05.040- 26:08.580* :  I've seen the statues, they're everywhere, they're in the squares, they're in the plazas.
*26:09.100- 26:11.960* :  They remind us of our history, it reminds us of where we came from.
*26:12.620- 26:14.940* :  It's because of Columbus's discovery, I am here today.
*26:15.700- 26:17.620* :  If not, I'd have been born on the other side of the world.
*26:18.500- 26:19.960* :  I believe this is a political move.
*26:20.840- 26:26.720* :  The logistics of even doing this, you have all these legal documents, passport, ID, driver's permit, all these things have to change.
*26:27.340- 26:33.800* :  All these signage on government villains have to change. The banknotes, millions and millions of dollars are going to be wasted to make this move.
*26:34.220- 26:36.420* :  When this money could be used to better the nation.
*26:37.140- 26:41.240* :  Luke Jones spoke to local journalist Ryan Beichou about the decision.
*26:41.800- 26:45.440* :  It came like a thief in the night, really, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago.
*26:45.440- 26:49.960* :  Dr Keith Raleigh announced it at a people's national movement convention.
*26:49.960- 26:52.720* :  That's a ruling party of Trinidad and Tobago at the moment.
*26:53.240- 27:00.620* :  Quite abruptly, really, it's sort of stunned the nation and sort of turned the entire news cycle around really a couple of Sundays ago.
*27:01.100- 27:12.600* :  And since then, Trinbigonians have sort of been split on the announcement to remove the three ships that Columbus came with here to Trinidad and Tobago from the Cota farms, a national emblem.
*27:13.020- 27:19.960* :  And so what are the people who are in favor of getting rid of, as you say, those three ships off the coast of Armstrong saying, and what are those who want to keep it saying?
*27:20.480- 27:24.740* :  There are, and there have been. It's important to understand that there have been calls.
*27:24.740- 27:36.660* :  There has been advocacy for quite a few decades for these emblems of colonialism to be removed from Trinidad and Tobago's signage and straight names, et cetera, et cetera.
*27:37.180- 27:42.940* :  And they have long advocated for things like this and they're saying this represents our colonial history.
*27:42.940- 27:52.500* :  And we're now past that colonial history and it is about time that we move into our own chapter of what our signatures look like and our emblems look like.
*27:53.100- 28:11.600* :  And then there are others who interestingly have grown in the voice over the last few days saying this should not be a national priority, not at this point, not with the economy doing the way it's doing, not with unemployment, the way it is, not with the crime situation in the Twin Island Republic, the way it is, this should not be our priority number one.
*28:12.060- 28:21.600* :  And then there was a very interesting letter to the editing, one of the daily newspapers today that also pointed to an argument of keeping such colonial symbols.
*28:22.220- 28:29.380* :  And I'll just read a short excerpt out of that letter for you. It said we should not pick and choose the history we want represented.
*28:30.060- 28:38.240* :  Let the colonial relics statues images and the like remain as a reminder of how far we have come since the days of imperialism and exploitation.
*28:38.400- 28:48.640* :  And that's from a letter to the editing, one of the daily newspapers today. So that's generally been the foreign against this argument since the announcement was made a couple of Sundays ago.
*28:48.900- 28:58.240* :  Interesting. Where else do you think this could go? I mentioned there are that there are streets and buildings also named after Christopher Columbus and colonizers like him. Could this extend much further?
*28:58.940- 29:14.600* :  It can. And it's really going to over the next few weeks. It's not going to stay at just the coat of arms because the coat of arms is just the start of it because there's a national consultation on this very issue that you just spoke about happening next week Wednesday.
*29:14.600- 29:26.660* :  That's all as 28th where the public will be able to come in and see if they think streets and monuments and statues should all be replaced that have that colonial flavor with it.
*29:27.040- 29:39.920* :  So the conversation is about to blow open. You're very right. The conversation is about to blow open in a very big way. And the public will be consulted through the Ministry of Gender and Child Affairs very soon within the next week.
*29:40.300- 29:50.540* :  And it would be interesting to see how far because Trinidad and Tobago having that Spanish influence, having that English that British influence through colonialism and history.
*29:50.540- 29:58.420* :  I come from a small town called Princess on its named after Prince Albert and Prince George, the grandson of Queen Victoria. We grew up in school learning about that.
*29:58.740- 30:06.120* :  And just being just from the capital port of Spain, which I guess is the other kind of example of it as well. Exactly. Ryan B2.
