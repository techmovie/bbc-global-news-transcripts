*01:31.380- 01:35.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:38.360- 01:42.740* :  I'm Janet Jalil, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 14th of August, these are our
*01:42.740- 01:48.780* :  main stories. President Biden has urged Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in Gaza saying it
*01:48.780- 01:56.100* :  could deter Iran from attacking Israel. Ukraine's President Zelensky says more than 70 communities in
*01:56.100- 02:01.900* :  Russia's Kursk region are now under Ukrainian control. Production at the world's biggest
*02:01.900- 02:06.600* :  copper mine in Chile is under threat, as workers strike over pay.
*02:10.040- 02:14.600* :  Also in this podcast, we can't wait to get him on his dollies and hopefully we'll get him off
*02:14.600- 02:17.360* :  the street and onto a funny beach cocktail in hand and see if possible.
*02:18.100- 02:25.560* :  Our community helped an Elvis-loving street cleaner go on the holiday of a lifetime despite his bosses.
*02:31.240- 02:36.820* :  President Biden has said he does not expect Iran to carry out a retaliatory strike on Israel
*02:36.820- 02:43.060* :  if a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal is reached in the next few days. The US government has
*02:43.060- 02:46.980* :  stepped up efforts to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
*02:47.420- 02:53.160* :  An American officials say that with a final and decisive round of negotiations expected on Thursday,
*02:53.180- 02:58.860* :  they're worried that any attack on Israel would scupper the negotiations and kill any hopes
*02:58.900- 03:04.200* :  of a deal that would see hostages released and end the daily killings in Gaza.
*03:04.960- 03:11.100* :  The number of dead there is now approaching 40,000 according to the Hamas run health authorities.
*03:11.940- 03:17.600* :  Israel has been braced for an attack by Iran since a Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran
*03:17.600- 03:23.320* :  last month. Mr. Biden spoke to reporters as he was getting off Air Force One in New Orleans.
*03:23.900- 03:26.720* :  See what Iran does and we'll see what happens if we're in any attack.
*03:28.020- 03:33.300* :  But I'm not giving up. Do you have the understanding that you're behind the scenes or stop
*03:33.700- 03:36.920* :  doing an action if a ceasefire deal is possible?
*03:37.920- 03:39.700* :  That's my expectation of what's happening.
*03:40.620- 03:45.000* :  Earlier, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas Greenfield, told the security
*03:45.000- 03:49.960* :  council meeting that the country's overall goal in the Middle East is to turn the temperature
*03:49.960- 03:56.520* :  down and to stop the war between Israel and Hamas from escalating to the whole region.
*03:57.280- 04:02.160* :  On the issue of the US moving an aircraft carrier group to the region, she had this to say.
*04:02.680- 04:09.960* :  Let me be clear. Our deployment of additional military assets are not a prediction of what is
*04:09.980- 04:18.200* :  to come. A broader regional conflict is not inevitable. The United States overall goal remains to
*04:18.200- 04:25.500* :  turn the temperature down in the region, deter and defend against any future attacks and avoid
*04:26.100- 04:30.740* :  regional conflict. Julian Marshall spoke to our chief international correspondent,
*04:30.740- 04:34.940* :  Lee Stusset and the latest developments, including reports that America's top diplomat,
*04:34.940- 04:39.920* :  Anthony Blinken, has postponed his upcoming trip to the Middle East ahead of those expected
*04:39.920- 04:45.580* :  Gaza ceasefire talks on Thursday. If he has postponed his trip because of what there's a
*04:45.580- 04:49.800* :  quote saying that because of the uncertainty in the region, it is not a very good sign. This
*04:49.820- 04:57.540* :  Julian was meant to be is still meant to be a week of high stakes, urgent diplomacy. Our listeners
*04:57.540- 05:03.860* :  may remember more than a week ago, the leaders of the United States, Qatar and Egypt issued for
*05:03.860- 05:11.180* :  the first time a statement saying time is up. There's no excuse now. A deal is on the table.
*05:11.180- 05:16.480* :  It's almost done. Get back to the table. And those are the talks set for Thursday.
*05:17.200- 05:22.180* :  So Anthony Blinken was going to head to the region to Tel Aviv and Ramallah to do his part of it.
*05:22.480- 05:27.440* :  We still understand that the senior advisor, Brett McGurk, is heading to Cairo. He was going to be
*05:27.440- 05:33.940* :  working on security for the main crossing between Egypt and Gaza at Rafa, Hockstein, who has been
*05:33.940- 05:40.780* :  working on trying to keep the tension, to minimize the tensions along the Lebanon Israel border,
*05:40.780- 05:45.240* :  is still going. So they're still going. I think now we have to wait and see whether Bill Burns
*05:45.240- 05:51.360* :  who will lead the negotiations on Thursday, whether he is still going. It feels like a very
*05:51.360- 05:57.220* :  tense day given what else has been happening in the region. Today, Hamas fired for the first time
*05:57.220- 06:02.420* :  in three months, rockets towards Tel Aviv. They landed off the coast, one off the coast one
*06:02.420- 06:07.780* :  or a year, but it's not a good sign. And it would appear that there's maybe a lot more than the
*06:07.780- 06:15.280* :  Gaza ceasefire hanging on these renewed negotiations. President Biden has just been asked if he
*06:15.280- 06:21.100* :  expected Iran to skip a retaliatory strike if a Gaza ceasefire was reached. And he said,
*06:21.100- 06:28.340* :  that's my expectation. That's a very interesting Biden half phrase because we have been told
*06:28.340- 06:35.720* :  repeatedly over the past more than a week now that Iran's threat to retaliate at a time in
*06:35.720- 06:41.440* :  place of its own choosing had been delayed so that it's any strike it does take. And it's it's
*06:41.440- 06:46.460* :  threatened a direct strike against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader
*06:46.460- 06:50.640* :  in Tehran at the end of July, that it would delay it because it doesn't want to be seen to be
*06:50.640- 06:56.360* :  scuffering any chance if there is a chance for a ceasefire. That is the main objective for Iran,
*06:56.360- 07:02.000* :  for his beloved others is to get a ceasefire done. So it's interesting that Biden has admitted that
*07:02.000- 07:07.040* :  they have been putting pressure indirectly on Iran. Arab leaders have been doing the same. And
*07:07.040- 07:12.220* :  there has been these reports all along that this was also in the mix. But I was on the phone today to
*07:12.220- 07:17.320* :  to very senior analysts in Iran and they both were very angry and said there will be an attack
*07:17.320- 07:24.580* :  but the timing is not clear. Least he said, well, Iran did carry out a direct attack for the first
*07:24.580- 07:30.780* :  time on Israel in April firing hundreds of drones and missiles nearly all of which were shot
*07:31.020- 07:37.740* :  down. But Dr. Ramin Paham, author and expert on Israeli-Iranian relations, says he thinks it
*07:37.740- 07:45.400* :  may be different this time. I don't think there is going to be retaliation at least not the way
*07:45.400- 07:52.820* :  we have been talking about or hearing about in the way that would immediately call for another
*07:52.820- 07:58.960* :  retaliation this time from Israel which would be absolutely catastrophic for the country.
*07:59.620- 08:04.740* :  There is much suffering on the Palestinian side. There is also much suffering perhaps in a different
*08:04.740- 08:11.640* :  way, certainly in a different way in Iran. People put their hope in position and the election
*08:11.640- 08:19.680* :  that brought him to where he is now not to have another war and not with Israel and the whole
*08:19.680- 08:26.320* :  Western allies of Israel. People put their hope in this election to have peace and perhaps
*08:26.320- 08:34.520* :  prosperity. So the perspective of a full-fledged war with Israel and Israel's Western allies
*08:34.520- 08:41.220* :  is not what the people want. I don't think the regime is ignorant of that fact. I don't think
*08:41.220- 08:46.000* :  that the regime is ignorant of the fact that the retaliation to their possible response
*08:46.000- 08:52.300* :  will be absolutely destructive for the country. It will annihilate what remains of this
*08:52.300- 08:55.420* :  infrastructure of the country and the economy of the country.
*08:56.020- 09:02.520* :  Dr Amin Farham. Meanwhile, the US, France and the United Nations have joined Saudi Arabia,
*09:02.520- 09:07.660* :  Egypt and Jordan in condemning a visit by Israel's far-right national security minister,
*09:07.660- 09:13.820* :  Itamar Ben-Govir, to Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Mr Ben-Govir entered the site accompanied by
*09:13.820- 09:19.740* :  about 2,000 Israeli Jews, many of whom prayed there despite such prayers being banned.
*09:20.320- 09:25.020* :  Washington says such actions are detrimental to the security of the region and, therefore,
*09:25.020- 09:32.000* :  unacceptable. Temple Mount, which is also known as Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, is deeply holy to both
*09:32.000- 09:38.920* :  Jews and Muslims. The UN Deputy spokesman, Fahan Haq, also criticized Mr Ben-Govir's actions.
*09:39.800- 09:45.800* :  Al-Aqsa Mosque, like the other holy sites in Jerusalem, should be left to themselves and should
*09:45.800- 09:53.560* :  be controlled by the existing religious authorities for the sites. This sort of behavior is
*09:53.560- 09:59.820* :  unhelpful and it is unduly provocative. In a long-running agreement aimed at preventing friction
*09:59.900- 10:06.440* :  between the two faiths, Jews are only allowed to pray at the Western Wall, which is adjacent to
*10:06.440- 10:12.340* :  Temple Mount. Just over a week after Ukraine's surprise military incursion into Russia,
*10:12.340- 10:18.320* :  it seems to have made rapid progress. The Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says his forces now
*10:18.320- 10:24.040* :  control more than 70 communities in the Kursk region of Western Russia. He said Kyiv's troops
*10:24.040- 10:33.760* :  were still advancing despite difficult and intense battles. All of us in Ukraine should act
*10:33.760- 10:39.400* :  as unitedly and efficiently as we did in the first weeks and months of this war. When Ukraine
*10:39.400- 10:45.440* :  took the initiative and began to turn the situation to the benefit of our state, now we have done
*10:45.440- 10:51.480* :  exactly the same thing. We have proven once again that we, the Ukrainians, are capable of achieving
*10:51.480- 10:57.640* :  our goals in any situation. Ukraine says the operation is defensive and that there's no plan to hold
*10:57.640- 11:02.660* :  on to the increasing amount of Russian territory that's been seized. Our correspondent James
*11:02.660- 11:08.560* :  Waterhouse reports from Ukraine's Sumy region from where the incursion was launched and which is
*11:08.580- 11:14.480* :  still a hive of activity. Russian State TV has described the first capturing of its territory
*11:14.480- 11:20.300* :  since the Second World War as an operation doomed to fail. Such conclusions may be premature,
*11:20.300- 11:25.560* :  as it's an offensive which certainly hasn't slowed. The size of Ukrainian armored vehicles driving
*11:25.560- 11:30.820* :  unopposed through the Russian town of Sulja is a striking reflection of how battlefield dynamics
*11:30.820- 11:36.940* :  have changed here. Instead of directing proceedings in Ukraine, Moscow is having to react to surprises
*11:36.940- 11:43.760* :  at home. Just across the border in the Sumy area of Ukraine, we meet a cord who's not long back
*11:43.760- 11:53.020* :  from fighting in the Kurdish region. We don't know the plan, so it's an unknown but it's interesting
*11:53.020- 11:57.880* :  and we're positive. We don't know what the plans are but we'll do everything we're required to.
*11:58.460- 12:03.880* :  Ukraine's objective is deliberately unclear. One possible goal is drawing Russian troops from other
*12:03.880- 12:10.280* :  parts of the front line. That is being realized but it is yet to slow Russian advances on Ukrainian soil.
*12:10.940- 12:20.640* :  He or he, Turkey, is from Ukraine's foreign ministry. Unlike Russia, Ukraine does not need someone
*12:20.640- 12:26.220* :  else's property. We want to protect the lives of our people. From the beginning of this summer alone,
*12:26.220- 12:31.760* :  there have been more than 2,000 attacks on the Sumy region. This is an operation which has restored
*12:31.760- 12:37.460* :  morale and momentum to Kiev's war effort. Some in Ukraine hope it will improve their position
*12:37.460- 12:42.640* :  for any potential peace negotiations. On the other hand, the events of this week could have
*12:42.640- 12:49.500* :  pushed talks even further away. James Waterhouse reporting from Ukraine. Poland has signed its biggest
*12:49.500- 12:55.600* :  ever military contract to buy nearly 100 combat helicopters from the United States. Warsaw has
*12:55.600- 13:01.480* :  accelerated its military modernization since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
*13:01.580- 13:06.960* :  The deal is worth 12 billion dollars. Adam Eastern reports from Warsaw.
*13:07.460- 13:14.700* :  Poland rates the Boeing made AH-64E Apache's as the best combat helicopters in the world.
*13:14.700- 13:20.360* :  They will replace the country's Soviet era machines and a due to start arriving in 2028.
*13:20.360- 13:25.960* :  Defenses become the top priority since Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine two and a half
*13:25.960- 13:31.460* :  years ago. Poland has already signed a multi-billion dollar deals to buy US fighter jets, tanks,
*13:31.460- 13:36.800* :  and patriot missile systems. Over the past decade, Polish military personnel have more than doubled
*13:36.800- 13:43.060* :  in its armed forces and now the largest in Europe. Adam Eastern. An outbreak of the highly
*13:43.060- 13:49.460* :  infectious M-Pox disease has been declared a public health emergency across Africa. The virus
*13:49.460- 13:55.020* :  formerly known as Monkey Pox is transmitted through close contact and causes pus-filled lesions
*13:55.020- 14:00.740* :  and flu-like symptoms. Since the start of the year, there have been nearly 14,000 cases in the
*14:00.740- 14:07.480* :  Democratic Republic of Congo with 450 deaths recorded. And it's now spread to Eastern and Central
*14:07.480- 14:14.320* :  African countries. A milder strain caused a global outbreak in 2022 affecting Europe, Australia,
*14:14.320- 14:20.960* :  and the US. But this latest variant is more deadly. Direct to general of the Africa Centers for
*14:20.960- 14:24.900* :  Disease Control and Prevention, which declared the emergency is Jean Casere.
*14:25.440- 14:34.200* :  M-Pox is a global threat, a means that knows no boundaries, no risks, no greed. And it is in this
*14:34.200- 14:41.500* :  moment of vulnerability that we must find our greatest strength and demonstrate that we are all
*14:41.500- 14:48.520* :  learning from the COVID lesson. Anne Remoin is professor of epidemiology at the University of California
*14:48.520- 14:54.240* :  Los Angeles whose led research on the Democratic Republic of Congo. She explained why public health
*14:54.240- 15:00.880* :  authorities were so concerned. The extent to which we are seeing increasing cases and the
*15:00.880- 15:08.500* :  acceleration of this has really been extraordinary in the last several months. And so that's why
*15:08.500- 15:13.680* :  this is so critical right now. We're starting to see a change in patterns of transmission,
*15:13.820- 15:19.760* :  who is getting it, how it's being transmitted, and that we're also starting to see it spread to
*15:19.760- 15:25.300* :  other areas. I heard more from the BBC's Africa Health Correspondent, Dokis Wangira.
*15:25.660- 15:31.240* :  This declaration is very important because M-Pox has been on the continent. And also this year,
*15:31.240- 15:38.160* :  particularly we are seeing the outbreak of the Claid-1B from the East and DRC affecting many
*15:38.160- 15:43.260* :  young people. And it's also spreading to countries where it never spread before Kenya, Uganda,
*15:43.340- 15:51.580* :  Rwanda and Burundi. And the Africa CDC says it is urgent that they act now to contain this virus.
*15:51.840- 15:56.040* :  Because if they don't, what are they worried about? So they're worried about many things. You
*15:56.040- 16:03.900* :  are seeing a spread in a way that they still do not understand yet. This Claid-1B is manifesting,
*16:03.900- 16:09.140* :  or it's spreading in a very unusual way. Because the initial Claid was a zoonotic disease,
*16:09.780- 16:14.140* :  jumping from animals to human beings. But now they're seeing this Claid-1B being more
*16:14.140- 16:20.700* :  sexual transmission, close contact, even from a mother to a child. We've even seen in the DRC
*16:20.700- 16:26.680* :  a case where a baby was born with M-Pox because the mother was infected. So when you have a Claid
*16:26.680- 16:31.200* :  that is acting differently, and you're having countries that didn't have it before,
*16:31.200- 16:37.460* :  that is a cause for concern. And M-Pox knows no borders, it spreads, it knows no religion or
*16:37.460- 16:42.720* :  creed, it can affect anyone. So what's going to be done now to try to stop the spread?
*16:42.720- 16:48.440* :  There are vaccines out there, aren't there? Yes, WHO has approved two vaccines for emergency
*16:49.540- 16:55.280* :  and Africa is trying to acquire some vaccines. Africa's disease says the need is for 10 million
*16:55.280- 17:01.100* :  doses and you're talking about two doses per person. However, Africa's disease can only acquire
*17:01.100- 17:07.440* :  200,000. So this is a serious issue. We try to think of it like this, it's like you have a
*17:07.440- 17:13.060* :  fire in your house and once you raise the alarm, now you can start fighting the fire. So this is
*17:13.060- 17:18.340* :  supposed to help facilitate international notification, working together for surveillance,
*17:18.340- 17:24.600* :  testing, acquiring vaccines, acquiring therapeutics and doing this together, not just as one
*17:24.600- 17:30.140* :  country's problem, but for the entire continent. Let's work together to contain the virus instead.
*17:30.380- 17:35.780* :  And you talk about the entire continent, is there a risk of this disease spreading from Africa to
*17:35.780- 17:44.400* :  other continents like Europe or Asia? So WHO did release new data today and according to WHO
*17:44.400- 17:51.080* :  Mpox right now, this outbreak is already in 26 countries, 16 are in Africa, but it is already
*17:51.080- 17:57.440* :  in the Americas and in Europe and also because again, this disease knows no borders, people travel
*17:58.180- 18:03.200* :  by that before it incubates, you may not know you have it and if there's no screening for it,
*18:03.440- 18:06.160* :  someone could easily travel from one area to the other.

*19:58.740- 20:04.120* :  A court in Uganda has found a former commander of the extremist group, the Lord's Resistance Army,
*20:04.120- 20:10.540* :  guilty of numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, kidnap and pillaging.
*20:11.320- 20:18.400* :  Thomas Coyello is the first LRA commander to be tried in Uganda. For two decades until 2006,
*20:18.400- 20:24.440* :  the group carried out many atrocities, abducting thousands of children. Our Africa regional editor
*20:24.440- 20:30.040* :  Will Ross was a correspondent in Uganda during the group's reign of terror and he told me more about
*20:30.040- 20:36.140* :  them. They were an extraordinary group that basically didn't really have an agenda that anybody
*20:36.140- 20:43.360* :  understood. They opposed U Airi M7ee's presidency and stated that they wanted to topple him
*20:43.360- 20:47.900* :  in his government and rule the country according to the 10 commandments. But obviously nobody
*20:47.900- 20:52.160* :  believed a word they said because they were moving around the north of the country, killing
*20:52.160- 20:58.660* :  people and abducting. But as you say, it was a two decades of real terror for the communities across
*20:58.660- 21:03.760* :  the north. At the worst moment, there were about two million people displaced living in camps
*21:04.560- 21:08.900* :  and there were terrible conditions that they were kept in and there was a lot of criticism of
*21:08.900- 21:14.420* :  the way that the Ugandan army dealt with the whole conflict. But it was just a total inability
*21:14.420- 21:19.420* :  for the north of Uganda to function, farming ground to our hope, people couldn't go to their
*21:19.420- 21:24.220* :  fields and tens of thousands of children were abducted and forced to fight as soldiers.
*21:24.820- 21:30.220* :  And now this commander Thomas Coyello has been found guilty despite his defense arguing that he
*21:30.220- 21:35.240* :  himself was a victim because he was abducted as a child. Yeah, his lawyer said he was abducted
*21:35.240- 21:40.680* :  at the age of 12 and some people will say, well, look, that does make him a victim. But obviously he
*21:40.680- 21:46.660* :  stayed in the group for so long and what tended to happen with the LRA is as soon as somebody was
*21:46.660- 21:51.700* :  abducted, they were often forced to go and carry out terrible atrocities in their home area.
*21:51.700- 21:56.920* :  So they'd be kind of ostracized by their own community. And in the case of Thomas Coyello,
*21:56.920- 22:03.600* :  he was an notorious commander and his name was very well known during those years, 2003, 2004,
*22:03.600- 22:08.400* :  2005. When I was there, there were a lot of atrocities that went on and one of the ones that
*22:08.400- 22:14.200* :  came up during the verdict that the judges read out was an attack on a camp for people who were
*22:14.200- 22:19.300* :  displaced by the conflict where dozens of women and children were beaten to death with wooden
*22:19.340- 22:27.200* :  clubs by young LRA abductees who were sent there by Thomas Coyello. Our Africa Regional Editor,
*22:27.200- 22:32.240* :  Will Ross. Let's go to Greece now and the wildfires that threatened the capital Athens
*22:32.300- 22:37.920* :  appear to be easing off. The flames killed a firefighter and a woman in her 60s and forced people
*22:37.920- 22:43.080* :  in some suburbs and surrounding areas to leave their homes. But milder winds and extensive
*22:43.080- 22:48.440* :  efforts by firefighters, some of whom have been sent by other European nations have helped to
*22:48.440- 22:54.820* :  reduce their intensity. Jessica Parker reports from Athens. The heavy haze and smoke clouds that
*22:54.820- 23:00.360* :  were hanging over much of Athens have dissipated. While fiery hotspots remain here and further
*23:00.360- 23:06.300* :  northeast, the main blaze is out. As residents survey the damage, there's grief at what's been
*23:06.300- 23:12.080* :  lost and anger that a wildfire managed to rip its way into the northern outskirts of the city.
*23:12.080- 23:17.360* :  Marina tells me of her agony after she had to evacuate her neighborhood by car.
*23:17.760- 23:21.380* :  As we were leaving through the fire and the smoke and the rubble,
*23:21.380- 23:27.560* :  there were people begging us to take them with us, but we were completely full and we had to deny
*23:27.560- 23:32.620* :  and see the agony in their faces. She, like many others, believes that the Greek fire
*23:32.620- 23:38.200* :  service is underfunded and the country unprepared for blazes that hit year after year.
*23:38.200- 23:42.940* :  The authorities have defended their work, saying the response was rapid and the conditions
*23:43.360- 23:49.180* :  extreme, drought, woodlands and high winds contributed to the spread. Athens is a city that over
*23:49.180- 23:54.780* :  decades has sprawled its way into hills and forests that are populated with highly flammable
*23:54.780- 24:01.360* :  pine trees. The wisdom of that expansion has long been questioned in a country so prone to wildfires.
*24:02.160- 24:07.760* :  Jessica Parker, in Greece. A man suspected of leading a prolific cybercrime gang has appeared
*24:07.760- 24:13.540* :  in court in the United States. Maxine Silnecow, who's 38 and from Belarus, was arrested in Spain
*24:13.540- 24:19.260* :  last month as part of an international police operation, coordinated by the UK's national
*24:19.260- 24:24.860* :  crime agency or NCA. Here's our senior technology reporter, Chris Balance.
*24:25.760- 24:31.760* :  Since 2015, the NCA has been hunting down the real person behind a range of notorious
*24:31.760- 24:39.820* :  hacker pseudonyms, including JP Morgan, XXX and Lansky. Now with the assistance of the FBI,
*24:39.820- 24:45.060* :  the US Secret Service and authorities from numerous countries, including Spain, Ukraine and Poland,
*24:45.060- 24:52.120* :  they believe they finally have their man. Maxine Silnecow, tracked down to an apartment in Spain.
*24:53.000- 24:58.320* :  The hackers are accused of using online advertisements, so-called malvertising, as a way of
*24:58.320- 25:03.600* :  installing malicious software on the computers of hundreds of thousands of victims and earning the
*25:03.600- 25:10.640* :  gang up to 26 million pounds a year. The suspected cybercriminals are also alleged to have developed
*25:10.640- 25:16.840* :  ransomware that would lock up machines under the guise of being from the police. Victims were
*25:16.840- 25:21.640* :  presented with alarming notices warning that they had been found to have downloaded child abuse
*25:21.640- 25:28.260* :  images or other illegal material and were coerced into paying bogus fines to avoid imprisonment
*25:28.520- 25:35.380* :  and to unlock their machines. Chris Balance. Workers at the world's largest copper mine, the Escondida,
*25:35.380- 25:41.180* :  in Chile, have gone on strike after government mediated pain negotiations fell apart. International
*25:41.180- 25:47.400* :  prices are likely to rise as Chile produces nearly a quarter of the world's copper. Leonardo
*25:47.400- 25:53.380* :  Russia reports. The strike is expected to hit production as the trade union represents nearly 99
*25:53.380- 25:59.340* :  percent of frontline workers and replacement staff are prohibited by Chilean law. The last strike
*25:59.340- 26:05.400* :  at Escondida mine lasted 44 days and led to a surge in copper prices on the global market.
*26:05.840- 26:10.580* :  Union leaders say they made every responsible effort to reach an agreement. The Australian
*26:10.580- 26:16.500* :  company that owns the mine PHP says it has activated a contingency plan to deal with a strike.
*26:16.940- 26:20.620* :  It describes its workers contracts as some of the best in the industry.
*26:21.400- 26:27.540* :  Leonardo Russia. The ocean liner the Titanic sank more than a century ago on its doomed maiden voyage
*26:28.040- 26:33.540* :  but it wasn't until 1985 that the wreckage was found. Since then the company that owns the
*26:33.540- 26:38.260* :  salvage rights has been to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to find and retrieve artifacts.
*26:39.100- 26:44.300* :  They've recovered roughly five and a half thousand items, the majority of which are now kept
*26:44.300- 26:50.180* :  in the US state of Georgia. And our science editor Rebecca Morel has been given rare access
*26:50.180- 26:56.960* :  to these extraordinary items. I've come to a warehouse in Atlanta. I'm not allowed to tell you
*26:56.960- 27:03.160* :  the exact location because what's inside here is incredibly precious. On the shelves around me
*27:03.160- 27:09.260* :  a thousand of items recovered from the Titanic. Everything from large metal parts of the ship
*27:09.680- 27:15.260* :  down to tiny buttons from passengers clothing and every item tells a story.
*27:17.180- 27:21.420* :  I am Thomasine Array. I'm the Director of Collections for the Titanic Artifacts.
*27:22.220- 27:28.160* :  This bag was recovered in 2000. The alligator's skin was tanned with chemicals that really
*27:28.160- 27:34.920* :  preserved the leather and the contents. And it belonged to Marion Minwell, the 63-year-old
*27:34.920- 27:39.500* :  milliner which means she did all the little detail work on hats and dresses. And just tell
*27:39.500- 27:45.580* :  us what some of these items are here. So these were all inside the bag and they're still intact.
*27:46.360- 27:50.680* :  One of the things that she had was an inspection card and this would have been a health check
*27:50.680- 27:56.240* :  that she had to have with her on Titanic. But what's really interesting is that we can see she was
*27:56.240- 28:02.240* :  originally supposed to sail on the majestic. She actually got rerouted onto Titanic. So unlucky.
*28:03.000- 28:09.800* :  And hey this looks like a letter. So this is a letter actually of reference from a former landlord.
*28:09.980- 28:14.960* :  She would have needed this when she got to the U.S. to find lodging and it says this is to certify
*28:15.020- 28:21.920* :  that we have always found Minwell to be a good tenant prompt with payment and it's signed.
*28:22.340- 28:28.440* :  What happens to her? Unfortunately, Minwell did not make it. She was one of the people who
*28:29.100- 28:34.500* :  perished and being able to tell her story and have these objects is really important because
*28:34.880- 28:38.640* :  otherwise, you know, 1500 names, she's just another name on the list.
*28:40.120- 28:47.000* :  Here on the table you've got a champagne bottle complete with its cork in the top and some liquid
*28:47.000- 28:52.380* :  inside about the third the way up, would you say? Yeah. So also there's a lot of beer bottles,
*28:52.380- 28:57.000* :  stockpots and kitchen pots because Titanic actually broke up around one of the kitchens. So it
*28:57.000- 29:02.060* :  just kind of littered this debris all over the ocean floor. And you've got nice in here that
*29:02.060- 29:08.000* :  tells a totally different story in top of it. Yeah, in a top of it. So we keep these sealed up because
*29:08.000- 29:13.620* :  these are actually little perfume vials. There was a perfume salesman on board and he had all his
*29:13.620- 29:19.880* :  little samples with him and actually you can still smell the perfume which is why we keep them sealed.
*29:21.140- 29:29.000* :  I mean it's very sweet. They're still so potent. And just in front, these are some bits of the ship
*29:29.000- 29:34.660* :  itself, right? Yeah, so these are rivets. These were the pieces that held the whole plates together
*29:34.760- 29:40.860* :  and really assembled the exterior hull of Titanic. So there were over three million of these on
*29:40.860- 29:45.500* :  the ship. Why these have so particular interest? When Titanic was saying there was a theory that
*29:45.500- 29:51.580* :  they were using substandard materials. There were high concentrates of slag in these which is
*29:52.140- 29:56.900* :  like a glass-like material that makes them maybe a little bit more brittle in the cold. If these
*29:57.180- 30:02.520* :  rivets were brittle and one of the rivet heads popped off easier, then it could have allowed the
*30:02.520- 30:07.180* :  seam to open up where the iceberg hit and made it bigger than it otherwise would have been.
*30:07.960- 30:13.540* :  The recovery is not without controversy. Some people think that the site should be treated
*30:14.060- 30:19.300* :  as a grave site and we shouldn't take anything from it. I mean, what would you say to that?
*30:20.400- 30:24.740* :  You know, Titanic is something that we want to respect and we want to make sure that we're
*30:24.740- 30:29.160* :  preserving the memory because not everyone can go down to Titanic, not everyone can go to the ship.
*30:29.640- 30:33.780* :  Titanic was a significant moment in the history of the world and it's something that everybody knows.
*30:34.440- 30:39.540* :  So being able to have these objects in these pieces and bring the stories to people is really important.
*30:40.860- 30:47.440* :  Thomas Siena Rae, talking to Rebecca Morrell. There's been outrage here in Britain after the
*30:47.440- 30:53.600* :  bosses of an Elvis-loving street cleaner refused to let him accept a holiday which his local community
*30:53.600- 30:59.200* :  had raised money for. The 63-year-old is a popular figure in Beckenham, the southeast London
*30:59.200- 31:05.520* :  borough where he works and now an ingenious solution has been found to ensure he does get to enjoy
*31:05.520- 31:12.100* :  a trip to Portugal after all. Harry Blight reports. Paul Spears has been working as a street
*31:12.100- 31:17.840* :  sweeper in Beckenham for seven years. He's known locally for playing music from a loud speaker
*31:17.840- 31:24.260* :  while cleaning the high street and caught the ear of local estate agent Lisa Marie Knight.
*31:24.560- 31:29.940* :  He walks past the office around about four o'clock every day playing a speaker that quite often
*31:29.940- 31:36.580* :  plays Elvis Bradley and I took a shine for that because I'm named Lisa Marie after Elvis
*31:36.580- 31:41.420* :  says he's daughter and so it's just always quite enjoyed. Here in his music it just gives you a little
*31:41.420- 31:47.520* :  perk up at the end of the working day. Lisa Marie learned that Paul was saving up to go on holiday
*31:47.520- 31:54.300* :  abroad to celebrate his 63rd birthday. He'd only ever left the country once to go to Portugal.
*31:54.880- 32:01.700* :  So Lisa Marie set up a crowdfunding page online and very quickly raised more than £3,000.
*32:02.140- 32:10.060* :  That's more than $3,800. He cried, I had tears in my eyes and it was really nice reading all the
*32:10.060- 32:14.620* :  lovely comments that had been left by the local community. We were both absolutely amazed.
*32:15.120- 32:20.860* :  But then the cleaning company Paul works for, Veolia, said he couldn't accept the gift
*32:21.280- 32:27.560* :  due to contractual obligations with the local authority. I was just really sad about it because
*32:27.560- 32:32.560* :  I didn't even think about the technicalities when I made it. It was just meant to be something nice.
*32:32.920- 32:38.400* :  But one woman found a loophole. We saw it ourselves in a new article and couldn't
*32:38.400- 32:43.960* :  bear thinking about Paul not getting his dream holiday. This is Zoe Harris. She works for On The Beach,
*32:43.960- 32:50.700* :  a travel company here in the UK. Zoe is the company's chief customer officer and devised a plan
*32:50.700- 32:58.580* :  to make a competition with such specific entry requirements. Surely only Paul Spears could win.
*32:58.780- 33:05.220* :  We asked for someone who loved Elvis was 63 years old, had the surname Spears and was a street cleaner
*33:05.220- 33:09.340* :  in Beckinham and were fairly confident that there would only be one possible winner.
*33:09.640- 33:16.420* :  The prize, a holiday to Portugal, worth that $3,800. Hopefully we'll get him off the streets of
*33:16.420- 33:19.240* :  Beckinham and onto a sunny beach cocktail in hand as soon as possible.
*33:19.680- 33:23.520* :  Unsurprisingly, Paul did win. Here's Lisa Marie.
*33:23.780- 33:29.240* :  Yeah, I saw him today and he blowed away, absolutely blown away at the mile.
*33:29.500- 33:33.300* :  I think it's incredible. I think it's really, really special.
*33:33.880- 33:39.940* :  And his employer, Veolia, says he can accept it and will make a donation of the same value
*33:40.280- 33:43.180* :  to a charity of Paul's choice. Harry Bly.
*33:45.920- 33:50.260* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
