*02:01.140- 02:07.340* :  2024 is expected to be a record breaking year for tourism with more travelers going on holiday
*02:07.340- 02:15.260* :  than ever before. Barcelona, Paris, Hawaii or Bali, they're all beautiful destinations that
*02:15.260- 02:20.440* :  attract tourists from all over the world but they are also struggling with overtourism.
*02:24.860- 02:30.640* :  We welcome foreigners for this revitalization of the community but there are so many violations
*02:30.720- 02:35.680* :  of basic manners like jay walking, dumping garbage, trespassing on people's property.
*02:37.160- 02:41.300* :  Too many visitors in one place can have a negative impact on those who live there
*02:41.300- 02:46.980* :  and it's also causing lasting environmental damage. So today we're asking how does this
*02:46.980- 02:52.940* :  relentless rise in global tourism impact the people who actually live in these sought-after locations?
*02:56.460- 03:02.700* :  And with me today is seasoned BBC TV Travel Log presenter Rajandata. You have been traveling now.
*03:02.700- 03:07.200* :  I thank Rajand for 20 years or more. Can I call you a lifelong Roma?
*03:08.160- 03:13.860* :  You could try calling me a lifelong Roma. I think I'd prefer to say because Roma implies that I'm
*03:13.860- 03:18.020* :  just drifting whereas I think I'm doing it for work. Well I know I'm doing it for work mostly
*03:18.020- 03:23.860* :  with a certain structure, schedule in mind, looking at certain stories which we pre-planned.
*03:23.860- 03:28.800* :  So I would like to think not so much a Roma and Drifter but a worker.
*03:30.780- 03:34.640* :  A worker who travels. A worker who travels. Once there are a moment on a particular trip
*03:34.700- 03:39.720* :  where you thought I'm becoming really concerned about overtourism. This is an issue now.
*03:40.440- 03:44.960* :  I mean first of all this is a uniquely 21st century phenomenon. We've never seen travel
*03:44.960- 03:52.540* :  like this before. The levels it's getting to. We are talking about 11.1 trillion dollars
*03:52.540- 03:57.840* :  contributed to the global economy by tourism according to the tourism trade body, the world
*03:58.240- 04:02.780* :  traveling tourism council. We're talking about an industry that is the third largest in the world
*04:02.780- 04:09.180* :  and the fastest growing. We're talking about one of the first or second employers of people in
*04:09.180- 04:14.280* :  certain countries in the world. It's in total 330 million people are employed in tourism.
*04:14.940- 04:21.140* :  And ultimately we're talking about a billion and a half tourists every year traveling around
*04:21.140- 04:27.860* :  the world and it's only going to grow. Before the pandemic tourism was reaching an all-time
*04:27.860- 04:33.800* :  high then. There were murmurings actually in louder than that from certain destinations that
*04:33.800- 04:38.520* :  hang on. We're being crushed here. We're being overwhelmed by the amount of tourists.
*04:39.160- 04:43.440* :  And yes it did occur to me and yes there was a lot of talk about planes and CO2 emissions.
*04:44.200- 04:48.360* :  The whole notion about global warming was coming. So it all became the kind of recognition
*04:49.220- 04:55.180* :  that actually maybe the world is not ours just to roam around and to wander around and explore.
*04:56.020- 04:59.580* :  But maybe we should be thinking a bit more about this. But I thought the pandemic also meant
*04:59.580- 05:04.560* :  that people weren't traveling as much. And yet we're about to see a record year this year and to
*05:04.560- 05:09.080* :  realm. Yes, quite. So you had that period during the pandemic where locals saw their own
*05:09.080- 05:13.140* :  communities and their own districts looking really beautiful and pristine without tourists.
*05:13.700- 05:18.480* :  Then the pandemic hit loads of people by the way left the industry. They got a huge
*05:18.480- 05:23.500* :  they had a huge crisis shortage of labor working in tourism. But anyway straight afterwards
*05:23.500- 05:29.200* :  they had what they call revenge tourism. Quite a lot of people certainly the West had saved up
*05:29.200- 05:33.580* :  quite a lot of money during COVID and they hadn't spent it on travel. They hadn't spent it with it
*05:33.640- 05:38.300* :  and there was this real suppressed feeling of I need to get out. Because for a lot of people
*05:39.220- 05:45.380* :  tourism has become travel has become a virtual human right. And margins as maybe markets that people
*05:45.380- 05:50.820* :  aren't expecting as well. I mean, India, China they're traveling extensively as well saving up
*05:50.820- 05:55.560* :  for these holidays of a lifetime. So the big change was in the early part of this
*05:55.560- 06:00.980* :  century when when the Chinese started exploring the world. Suddenly hotels were becoming China ready.
*06:00.980- 06:06.340* :  They were having Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers employed in hotels. That big boom decline
*06:06.340- 06:10.560* :  hugely actually during pandemic because the Chinese on the whole tend to be more cautious about
*06:10.560- 06:16.940* :  health and safety. And that has now been overtaken by the Indian outbound market which is
*06:17.000- 06:24.680* :  incredible. We're talking about a population of 1.5 billion people so that if even 0.5% of them
*06:25.440- 06:30.640* :  travel or have the money to travel that is still a huge number of people coming into the market.
*06:31.060- 06:37.220* :  There's so many Indians going to Antarctica now. They want to travel to Amazon. They want to travel
*06:37.220- 06:44.560* :  to Machu Picchu. In year 2000 and I started a travel log it was dream for people to travel.
*06:45.080- 06:49.200* :  But today they are traveling everywhere and and they want to know new places.
*06:49.700- 06:55.060* :  Also Indian weddings. Very popular. There are some amazing stories. I mean, that's Bollywood as well.
*06:55.060- 07:00.760* :  Yes, of course, of course. Yeah, Indian weddings. But also special birthdays. These then become
*07:00.760- 07:05.940* :  for those who are very rich. These become huge events where they take out 200, 300 people.
*07:05.940- 07:11.040* :  They take over a whole little town. They will pay for the railway to be exclusively theirs as one
*07:11.040- 07:17.020* :  example. They might want 300 A-class Mercedes-Benz for their guests. All for a 50th birthday.
*07:17.020- 07:22.780* :  All for a 50th birthday. I mean, these are extreme examples. But as I say, you only need a
*07:22.780- 07:27.680* :  tiny percentage of, for example, Indian people to have that disposable income and they will be
*07:28.120- 07:29.340* :  much more in evidence around the world.
*07:34.200- 07:37.780* :  Well, let's talk about some of the destinations that are really struggling with over tourism.
*07:37.940- 07:44.180* :  It's upsetting local people. But what are some of the cities, the destinations that you would
*07:44.180- 07:49.100* :  say are being a bit crushed at the moment by too many people? Barcelona is the one that I really
*07:49.100- 07:56.260* :  had personal testimony of being there and seeing it change. And I went first before the Olympics.
*07:56.800- 08:01.780* :  That was in 1992. The Olympics were a huge game changer. Basically, the whole city was
*08:01.900- 08:06.560* :  well, not wholly, but a lot of the city was gentrified. You had cruise liners coming in.
*08:06.560- 08:12.100* :  You had a whole new redevelopment on the port area. You opened up the city to the water, didn't you?
*08:12.100- 08:16.100* :  Exactly. You had a huge, you knew beach. And the city completely transformed. And
*08:16.100- 08:21.160* :  low-cost airlines, for example, were already taken people from western countries there. But I think
*08:21.160- 08:26.900* :  nobody really latched on to how amazing it was until the Olympics and then the development that
*08:27.100- 08:31.480* :  happened during and after that. So since then, it's been relentless. Local people
*08:32.100- 08:37.260* :  and we did a story for the travel show that I work on. We did a story about locals complaining
*08:37.260- 08:42.160* :  quite a long time ago. It could tend to well 15 years ago. We did that story because it was
*08:42.160- 08:46.960* :  brewing. There was a huge amount of resentment. On a particularly cramped,
*08:46.960- 08:54.380* :  crowded summer day, you would not be able to do much. You would see the sweaty bodies of the people
*08:54.380- 09:02.640* :  pushing against you and being afraid upon by big pockets and staring at the living statues,
*09:03.300- 09:08.540* :  sometimes going into some like overpriced restaurants. It's a historic area. It's got very narrow
*09:08.540- 09:15.120* :  streets. So all you need is one big outpouring of from a cruise liner coming in for three hours
*09:15.540- 09:20.640* :  and the whole place gets jammed. The resentment as well was that these people were coming in for a
*09:20.640- 09:25.580* :  day not staying the night, therefore not spending much money and just kind of causing huge amounts
*09:25.580- 09:31.820* :  congestion and then disappearing. So the solution is always the same. If you are unhappy in the old
*09:31.820- 09:37.040* :  city, just leave. You know, the problem is that I used to live here before all this happened and I
*09:37.040- 09:42.920* :  don't want to leave. It was for locals also worrying because the short-term rentals were rising.
*09:42.920- 09:46.820* :  In other words, they were more and more available for the holiday maker which pushed up prices,
*09:47.220- 09:50.400* :  which margined life. If you're a young local person living in Barcelona,
*09:50.400- 09:53.940* :  you can't find a place to rent. You can't find a place to rent. And this is the common thread,
*09:53.940- 09:58.580* :  by the way. It's the edging out of locals. Pricing out of locals. Pricing out precisely.
*09:59.200- 10:02.540* :  I mean, there's been these big protests in the Balliara Islands recently.
*10:08.120- 10:11.140* :  What are some of the challenges they're facing there? Because that's an industry where that
*10:11.140- 10:14.900* :  also need young people to work. They need waiting staff. They need bartender staff.
*10:15.100- 10:18.500* :  Absolutely. People to work in the hotels. Absolutely. Where do they stay? Where do they live?
*10:18.760- 10:23.120* :  Well, I think there was a story on the BBC website not so long ago about, for example,
*10:23.120- 10:28.160* :  a chef who works in a local hotel or restaurant, who is forced to sleep in his car,
*10:28.840- 10:32.580* :  because he can't afford to live locally. I mean, we are talking, by the way,
*10:32.880- 10:39.100* :  a bit of a population of 160,000 and gets four million visitors a year. And however,
*10:40.160- 10:46.640* :  a figure is 80% of the economy is based around tourism. So what do you do? I mean, this also applies
*10:46.640- 10:51.160* :  to the Caribbean islands, for example, as well, where they are totally focused on tourism.
*10:51.160- 10:55.460* :  And they rely on people coming from afar to get there. But going back to
*10:56.840- 11:01.360* :  Ibiza in New York, yes, there have been huge demonstrations. It is about this sense of,
*11:01.480- 11:07.960* :  I call it, feeling like extras in your own movie. A city that you love or a area that you love
*11:08.320- 11:12.660* :  is completely taken over. I mean, are they worried as well about the erosion of their own culture?
*11:12.980- 11:18.660* :  Exactly that. Because with so many people, lots of people, I guess, speaking English in some cities,
*11:18.660- 11:23.700* :  as well. You hear less of the local language being spoken. The demands of a more
*11:23.700- 11:29.480* :  almost international experience, sometimes. Yeah. And obviously, local customers get squashed,
*11:29.480- 11:34.700* :  because tourists want their thing. They want what they use to a nice latte, a nice coffee
*11:34.700- 11:40.400* :  shop. Make your finds a flat white. A flat white, right? Food wise, probably, you know, there
*11:40.400- 11:44.580* :  are some demanding tastes from tourists, and if they can afford it, they'll guess what,
*11:44.580- 11:48.720* :  there'll be a restaurant for them there. The notion of international good taste, isn't it,
*11:48.720- 11:54.040* :  that exists everywhere now. They can kind of muscle out things that are local. What about
*11:54.040- 12:00.560* :  Austria? You had, I know, an amazing trip to Hellster. There is this little village in Austria,
*12:00.960- 12:06.300* :  about 40 kilometers away from Salzburg. It's called Hellster. Which is sound of music territory?
*12:06.300- 12:10.800* :  Which is sound of music territory. And obviously, in itself, a huge draw. I've done a sound of
*12:10.800- 12:14.960* :  music tour. Have you had music? It was fantastic. I loved it. Did you go up in the hills of them?
*12:14.960- 12:19.360* :  Yeah, I ran across the hills, singing the hills are a lot. What were you wearing? No, not just
*12:19.360- 12:24.460* :  jeans and a t-shirt, I think, but still. So not really, Andrews. But here in Hellster, it's not
*12:24.460- 12:29.380* :  dissimilar in some ways. It's a little town, 800 residents. It's got a beautiful lake. I mean,
*12:29.380- 12:35.400* :  it's picture postcard perfect. It's just beautiful. Lovely mountainside in the background,
*12:35.400- 12:44.060* :  lovely beautiful architecture. But 800 residents, and they have, during pixies and 10,000 guests a day.
*12:44.680- 12:50.640* :  Now, that's because one is an urban myth that people have drawn it. And that is, the town is based
*12:50.640- 12:57.680* :  on Arondelle, which is the town in the Disney film Frozen. So while I was there, I met a mother
*12:57.680- 13:02.280* :  who was from South Korea, I think. And she had two little daughters with her. They were dressed up
*13:02.280- 13:07.020* :  exactly. And it was cute. And they were there for that reason. And they didn't actually care if
*13:07.020- 13:11.820* :  Arondelle was based on that or not. I mean, apparently it's not. But there you go. My name is Mi-Jong-Kan.
*13:12.560- 13:20.080* :  And I came with my two daughters. Four and six years old. Many friends told me that Hoshita is so
*13:20.080- 13:26.580* :  beautiful. So I really wanted to come here. And then they have a spring break. So I wanted to show
*13:26.600- 13:35.420* :  them. And they are fan of Frozen, the movie Frozen. So they dress like princess now.
*13:35.560- 13:40.900* :  Yeah, they look very pretty. Yeah, I'm trying to take picture of them with beautiful scenery.
*13:41.780- 13:46.200* :  It is actually featured or has, has been featured in a South Korean soap opera. So therefore,
*13:46.200- 13:50.940* :  it actually is in reality based in somewhere. And it's got to the point where in China, apparently,
*13:50.940- 13:59.560* :  there is a life-size replica of howstad, which is astonishing. So, Raj, what is life like for
*13:59.560- 14:04.500* :  those in the residence? Exactly. That's the point. And so I talked to one resident who's
*14:04.500- 14:10.320* :  no urban architect lives up in the hills. And he was bemoaning the fact that basically,
*14:10.320- 14:15.660* :  they're walking through gardens, taking selfies while residents are having coffee in their garden.
*14:15.940- 14:22.860* :  They are in the graveyard taking selfies. There's one particular scenic spot where you can get
*14:22.860- 14:28.300* :  such a perfect selfie with the with the lake in the background that the locals or the mayor, in fact,
*14:28.300- 14:33.260* :  tried to block it for a while. And to me, make a comment. People who live here say the tourists start
*14:33.260- 14:39.400* :  coming at seven in the morning up till 11 at night. There are hundreds and thousands of people
*14:39.400- 14:44.640* :  going up there. It's difficult to sleep and it's loud and it's noisy. And they were feeling they
*14:44.640- 14:50.760* :  just can't go on like that. So we said, if you want a fence, we can do that. And that's what we
*14:50.760- 14:56.680* :  did. We put up a fence, a barrier, so you couldn't see the view from that point. But then people said,
*14:57.020- 15:01.940* :  that's not actually what we want. Because it not only prevents tourists from taking pictures,
*15:01.980- 15:08.380* :  but it also prevents us from seeing the town. So it was only up there four, two days. And then we
*15:08.380- 15:14.500* :  took it back down again. And that exploded. It was on social media and TV stations all over the
*15:14.500- 15:20.920* :  world. I mean, we do try to tell tourists that other places are also beautiful. Please don't come
*15:20.920- 15:27.180* :  to Halstein all the time. But I don't think they really listen. But with that policy, it's catching.
*15:27.240- 15:32.080* :  That policy was taken up on Mount Fuji not so long ago. Where did the same thing? They stop people
*15:32.080- 15:37.580* :  from taking pictures of Mount Fuji from just in front of a convenience store because it was it was
*15:37.780- 15:44.100* :  this is Fujikawa Guchiko. Very well said. Yes. Our correspondent, Shima Khalil, actually went there.
*15:44.500- 15:48.680* :  You've probably seen this on your Instagram or TikTok. This is the famous Mount Fuji
*15:48.680- 15:53.320* :  loss and the social media money shot for millions of visitors. But it's not going to be around for long.
*15:54.120- 15:58.180* :  Residents here in Fujikawa Guchiko are fed up with tourists behaving badly,
*15:58.700- 16:02.840* :  all to get the perfect shot of the convenience store with the snow-capped volcano.
*16:04.160- 16:08.140* :  As a desperate measure, the local authorities are building a barrier to block the view.
*16:09.740- 16:14.620* :  You can get a picture of Mount Fuji from many places, but social media has become a big
*16:14.660- 16:20.940* :  pool for this particular spot. How many of those 800 residents Raj actually work in tourism and
*16:20.940- 16:26.220* :  benefit directly from all of these people coming in? That's a very good point. I spoke to the local
*16:26.220- 16:32.580* :  there and he said only 20% of people who live there actually work in tourism there. There is a
*16:32.580- 16:38.480* :  fair side of a amount of people who are retired. There are other people who just work in other
*16:38.480- 16:43.520* :  industries and so therefore they're not all directly benefiting from tourism. Do they have a dream
*16:43.520- 16:47.120* :  of retirement? They're living this beautiful place. They can have their coffee in the sunshine in
*16:47.120- 16:50.840* :  the garden. And before you know it, they've got tourists of trampling through taking photos of them
*16:51.340- 16:56.260* :  as they're sitting there. Not very much money. In some of these places stays in those places.
*16:56.700- 17:00.380* :  The local authorities will say, yes, we're reinvesting money that we get from parking whatever
*17:00.380- 17:05.800* :  into local facilities and resources, but actually a lot of it isn't. That's called leakage by the
*17:05.800- 17:11.980* :  way. We're a lot of the money that is made in these tourist centres actually doesn't stay within
*17:11.980- 17:18.060* :  the economy. In many destinations, water is a big issue. I've talked to somebody who's in Kenya
*17:18.680- 17:24.440* :  where quite often you'll get luxury tourists. Look, pretty well competing with locals for water
*17:24.440- 17:31.080* :  when there is scarcity. Guess who wins? The luxury hotels. Local farmers in Kenya and in other
*17:31.080- 17:35.900* :  places are very suspicious of tourism because it actually can get in the way of them doing their job.
*17:35.980- 17:42.040* :  It's the ecosystem, it's the environment. So yes, the ecological damage is huge.
*17:43.420- 17:47.540* :  So we've looked at where in the world is struggling with the impact of over tourism. But next we
*17:47.540- 17:50.800* :  want to explore the solutions. Is there anything we can do about it?
*17:58.720- 18:05.680* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school. As in, they've got your back to school lunch favourites
*18:05.680- 18:10.780* :  like snack packs and fresh fruit. And they've got your back to school supplies like backpacks,
*18:10.780- 18:17.780* :  binders and pencils. And they've got your back when your kid casually tells you they have a huge
*18:17.780- 18:25.340* :  school project to do tomorrow. Let's face it, we were all that kid. So first, call your parents
*18:25.340- 18:31.640* :  to say I'm sorry and then download the Instacart app to get delivery in as fast as 30 minutes

*19:31.920- 19:37.680* :  travellers and it's fair to say that there are some places that are doing well. They have come
*19:37.680- 19:42.980* :  up with some solutions and they're working. There are two sides to this. One is what the local
*19:42.980- 19:49.000* :  municipality does or the local mayor or whoever. The other one is what we can do as individuals.
*19:49.000- 19:53.980* :  Okay. So let's just start with what places can do. So in Venice, for example, they have introduced
*19:53.980- 20:00.420* :  this five euro admission fee. It's not much five euro. It's not much five euro. And I did talk to
*20:00.420- 20:04.300* :  tourists there and they said, yeah, no, that's not going to stop me from doing. Because you know,
*20:04.300- 20:09.320* :  I can get a cup of coffee for that. But I talked to the deputy mayor as in charge of tourism and
*20:09.320- 20:14.960* :  he said, well, the point isn't actually this at this stage to charge people and make money out of
*20:14.960- 20:19.760* :  it and dissuade them. It's more for them to realize when the peak days are and to when to avoid it.
*20:19.760- 20:23.720* :  They're collecting data by doing this because you have to actually go online and do this. And the
*20:23.720- 20:30.140* :  actual cost of the administration, it's only met by the fee that are charging. However, I believe
*20:30.140- 20:35.220* :  they are thinking about doubling that fee because it's actually worked quite well so far. I mean,
*20:35.220- 20:41.400* :  other places will charge hotel fees as well, hotel taxes, combination taxes, they're called
*20:41.820- 20:45.260* :  a country like Bhutan will charge you a huge amount just to come into the country.
*20:45.560- 20:49.540* :  And Raj, with that data that they're collecting in Venice, is the idea that they'll then encourage
*20:49.540- 20:55.240* :  people to come midweek? Exactly. And it spreads the burden. Not just midweek, but in what they call
*20:55.240- 21:00.860* :  the shoulder season, exactly. So spring and autumn for us in the west. And that is another way
*21:00.860- 21:07.460* :  of trying to shift the weight of tourism. There is an issue with that, which I feel that you're
*21:07.460- 21:13.260* :  about to come to, which is school holidays. And that obviously, unless that changes, unless
*21:13.260- 21:18.120* :  the most of the west certainly has stops having school holidays in July and August, it's about
*21:18.120- 21:22.740* :  the same time, then we're always going to get that crush around that time. What about the move to
*21:22.740- 21:28.420* :  encourage people to go to similar destinations that are nearby? There is nowhere in the world
*21:28.420- 21:32.880* :  like Venice, but there are other very beautiful places around Venice that people could go to.
*21:33.020- 21:38.400* :  Yeah, it's called dispersal. I call it spreading the love, where you try and dissuade people from
*21:38.400- 21:43.100* :  going to the likes of Venice or wherever and going to other nearby towns or cities that have
*21:43.100- 21:50.100* :  the similar, similar beauty. We went to Slovenia and we went to a place called Bokin and there,
*21:50.100- 21:55.240* :  at the moment, it's actually building up. I mean, I went in April and there were quite heavy
*21:55.240- 22:01.040* :  crowds there. So he's worried about, even if there's spillover from late glad or even from places
*22:01.040- 22:07.220* :  other places, that they're going to get crushed as well. So yes, you can definitely spread the love,
*22:07.220- 22:12.400* :  you can have dispersal, but it's not necessarily going to be the answer either. If the next place along,
*22:13.240- 22:17.980* :  also then suffers in the same way. Rush, what kind of travelers do these cities want? Is it the
*22:17.980- 22:24.520* :  sort of luxury traveler, the high spending traveler or they want the backpackers to stay away?
*22:24.520- 22:31.160* :  How does that kind of formula work? Well, the mantra is high value low volume. That's the big
*22:31.160- 22:37.200* :  mantra in the tourism industry right now. Now, what does that mean? I think they want it to mean yes,
*22:37.200- 22:43.220* :  stays more than two or three nights. Yes, maybe takes public transport to come in. Yes,
*22:43.220- 22:50.220* :  it's locally, yes, respect, local culture. I mean, you're describing quite a few backpackers here.
*22:50.260- 22:54.860* :  Yeah. Well, here's the thing. Interestingly, I talked to a professor of tourism quite recently,
*22:55.300- 23:01.640* :  and he said, you know what, the budget traveler, the backpacker, actually in many ways,
*23:02.360- 23:07.120* :  make sure that there is less leakage, the term I used before, that most of the money stays within
*23:07.120- 23:11.600* :  the country and the local economy because they will stay in cheaper places. They will take public
*23:11.600- 23:16.640* :  transport. They will stay longer. They will not destroy the environment in the way that sometimes
*23:16.640- 23:21.840* :  a luxury traveler can do. The luxury traveler quite often will stay in a very expensive hotel,
*23:21.840- 23:27.180* :  which is quite likely to be owned by an international hotel. And do everything there, have the meals there?
*23:27.260- 23:31.040* :  Well, that's the all-inclusive issue, yes, absolutely. And yes, they can quite possibly do that too.
*23:31.300- 23:36.340* :  But there, that money does not necessarily stay in the country. So there are a few things that
*23:36.340- 23:40.000* :  might be counterintuitive that the tourism industry may be waking up to, which is thinking,
*23:40.980- 23:42.460* :  maybe I shouldn't just be appealing to those tourists.
*23:47.920- 23:52.540* :  Are we reaching peak tourism? Do you think this year is about to be a record year?
*23:52.540- 23:58.280* :  Is it going to keep going up? I hate to say this, but well, there's no reason why it shouldn't
*23:58.540- 24:05.820* :  go up. The issue is more whether they start taking measures to limit the number of people
*24:05.820- 24:11.820* :  traveling, certainly to certain destinations. I think people anyway, with selfie culture,
*24:11.820- 24:15.560* :  and we haven't really talked about that, but it's so important selfie culture, that with that,
*24:16.140- 24:21.400* :  people, especially young people are looking to go to new places, okay? Now, you want a selfie that's
*24:21.400- 24:26.940* :  different. So you want a selfie that's perhaps based in a particular experience that is unique to you
*24:27.420- 24:31.580* :  where you've gone on a special trip with a local or something, and then you take that picture
*24:31.900- 24:36.880* :  or new places where no one has ever been. I mean, I went to Uzbekistan recently, people,
*24:36.880- 24:41.420* :  I know that I think that will become a big tourist place soon, because it's uncharted territory,
*24:41.420- 24:45.560* :  it's somewhere where people haven't been before, and I think that will apply to a load of other
*24:45.560- 24:50.660* :  countries. So in a good way, there's nothing wrong with peak travel. If that peak travel is
*24:50.660- 24:56.080* :  benefiting loads of people in loads of places in the world, and that quite often involves not just
*24:56.920- 25:01.680* :  being in a place, but as it say experiencing something, doing something that is again,
*25:01.680- 25:06.580* :  special and unique, which I, by the way, professionally have been lucky to do, because that's the
*25:06.580- 25:11.080* :  stuff of my programs, but I think more and more people are now looking for that. That is the next
*25:11.080- 25:15.600* :  stage. They talk about there being a progression in terms of how tourism has gone. So it started
*25:15.600- 25:21.640* :  off as being transactional. I buy a holiday. I buy a nice package holiday in wherever. All I'm
*25:21.640- 25:26.400* :  paying you money, I get what I pay for, a nice beach and pool and all that sort of stuff.
*25:26.880- 25:30.980* :  The next one was experiential, which I've just talked about. So in other words, it's not just
*25:31.660- 25:35.560* :  buying something, but actually experiencing, feeling something, having something unique. The next
*25:35.560- 25:41.440* :  stage they talk about is transformational, where your life changes because you have been somewhere,
*25:41.440- 25:48.840* :  and you blend in with the local environment, and it's soul-enhancing. So yeah, these are
*25:49.260- 25:53.840* :  stages. And this idea of dispersal that you've talked about. We might be looking at dispersal
*25:53.840- 25:59.020* :  literally from Western Europe all the way across to the stands, or to central Europe and the Caucasus.
*25:59.260- 26:03.200* :  I can see that happening definitely, definitely, yeah, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe,
*26:04.280- 26:09.280* :  yep, the Starns. I mean, these places have got magnificent histories and culture and architecture.
*26:09.720- 26:14.100* :  Yes, go there, and they've got, I think, would love you to be there. So I would certainly
*26:14.100- 26:17.520* :  be making this place. Yeah, wonderful food. Absolutely so.
*26:17.520- 26:21.340* :  Of the Naminia recently, the food is exceptional. I mean, you've been somewhere I haven't been,
*26:21.340- 26:24.600* :  which is really good. Well, we're talking about bragging rights.
*26:25.520- 26:31.240* :  But also dispersal also means, no, go to Rotterdam, not Amsterdam, it can mean go to Valencia,
*26:32.020- 26:37.760* :  not Barcelona. You know, there are plenty of options, which are pretty good. The problem is,
*26:38.440- 26:42.980* :  here's the problem, suppose you've come from a long way way, you're coming to Europe, you've got
*26:42.980- 26:48.160* :  two weeks, you've spent ages saving up this money for this trip of a lifetime, you're there for
*26:48.160- 26:52.380* :  two weeks, you come to Europe, you've got Schengenries, maybe, of course you're going to go to the
*26:52.380- 26:56.600* :  Eiffel Tower, of course you want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, of course you want to see Venice,
*26:56.980- 27:02.120* :  and who are we to stop them? And who are we to stop them? That brings me, I think, to our final
*27:02.120- 27:08.360* :  thought, you and I have both traveled a lot. It would be hypocritical of us to say at any point,
*27:08.660- 27:13.420* :  you know, you can't travel. It is the most enriching, wonderful, amazing experience.
*27:14.460- 27:17.620* :  It's managing it, going forward. That seems to be the big challenge.
*27:17.620- 27:21.340* :  Absolutely, true. They used to talk about destination marketing in the travel industry,
*27:21.340- 27:24.840* :  now they talk about destination management. So that is a reflection of what you're talking about.
*27:25.060- 27:30.920* :  But yes, I mean, I'd be hypocrit. If I said to younger people who haven't traveled much
*27:31.940- 27:37.300* :  anywhere in the world, or to people in emerging economies who only now can afford to travel,
*27:37.900- 27:42.520* :  don't travel because you're killing the world. You're ruining the earth. How can I say that?
*27:42.800- 27:47.120* :  I mean, even for me, Raja, I'm on the bottom of the world from New Zealand. We are raised to believe
*27:47.120- 27:51.920* :  that you must go out and see the rest of the world. It's part of growing up. It's part of living
*27:51.920- 27:56.640* :  your life. It's a cultural expectation. And I'm not going to deny that. It's absolutely true.
*27:57.060- 28:00.560* :  It is fantastic traveling the world. It's brilliant. For all the obvious reasons,
*28:01.160- 28:06.060* :  it's a fantasy. You grow as a person to travel. There's a funny line, by the way, which is where
*28:06.520- 28:11.680* :  I think it's a writer said, people travel thousands of miles to talk to people who are just
*28:11.680- 28:16.820* :  like their neighbours, who they normally ignore. Because we enter a different mindset, don't we,
*28:16.820- 28:21.120* :  when we go over? We feel like we can be more adventurous and talk to locals and everything is
*28:21.120- 28:28.120* :  wonderful. And that's true. It has so many different beneficial effects on people, on culture,
*28:28.120- 28:33.700* :  on relations between different cultures. And you know, I wouldn't knock it. So I suppose what I would
*28:33.700- 28:40.140* :  say is, please travel, please travel. But just watch how you travel the way you travel. Just be
*28:40.140- 28:45.780* :  slightly more conscious of the host community. Would you like them to act like that in where you live?
*28:45.780- 28:51.800* :  I think that that is such a crucial thing. It's to have respect. You are a guest. You're not
*28:51.800- 28:57.300* :  entitled to this. You're a guest. But do travel. It is life changing. You just don't meet anyone
*28:57.300- 29:03.640* :  who wouldn't say it changed my life, my perspective, so many things from travel. And I am the
*29:03.760- 29:06.660* :  and we both are some of the luckiest people on planet. Yeah, indeed.
*29:07.120- 29:11.000* :  Rush, thank you. Great to be with you Lucy. Thank you very much for having me. And good luck on
