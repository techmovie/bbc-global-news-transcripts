*00:24.020- 00:28.880* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts, they said,
*00:28.960- 00:30.740* :  what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:32.200- 01:36.840* :  President Biden has warned the Democratic National Convention that November's election
*01:36.840- 01:39.580* :  will be a battle for the soul of America.
*01:40.440- 01:45.700* :  Israel's army says it's recovered the bodies of six hostages from Gaza as an Israeli strike
*01:45.700- 01:49.620* :  on a school there is reported to have killed at least 10 Palestinians.
*01:52.120- 01:52.960* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:52.960- 01:58.340* :  But this is a double flyby lunar earth flyby that's never been done before because it's
*01:58.340- 02:05.180* :  a very risky procedure, a spacecraft is using the gravitational pull of the earth and the
*02:05.180- 02:07.400* :  moon to help it reach Jupiter.
*02:11.660- 02:17.280* :  I gave my best to you the words of President Joe Biden as he delivered what many regard
*02:17.280- 02:22.880* :  as his farewell address to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and bust in
*02:22.880- 02:28.740* :  the adulation of supporters energized by his decision to pass the torch to his Vice President
*02:28.740- 02:32.880* :  Kamala Harris instead of trying to run again himself against Donald Trump.
*02:33.440- 02:38.700* :  The crowd repeatedly chanted thank you Joe as he listed his achievements in a political
*02:38.700- 02:41.600* :  career that has spanned more than half a century.
*02:42.320- 02:47.080* :  And eight years after Hillary Clinton won more votes than Donald Trump but still lost the
*02:47.080- 02:51.760* :  US presidential election because of its voting system, she also took to the stage in Chicago
*02:51.760- 02:57.360* :  to urge Americans to make Kamala Harris the nation's first female president.
*02:58.080- 03:00.840* :  Emma Vardy sent this report from the convention in Chicago.
*03:04.460- 03:13.740* :  There was a surprise early appearance on stage from the Democrat headline act and Kamala Harris
*03:13.740- 03:17.820* :  got a rock stars welcome ahead of her star turn later in the week.
*03:20.140- 03:25.420* :  It's less than a month since Joe Biden pulled out of the race and in a short space of time
*03:25.420- 03:28.120* :  Kamala Harris has rejuvenated the party.
*03:28.500- 03:36.020* :  This November we will come together and declare with one voice as one people we are moving
*03:36.020- 03:36.820* :  forward.
*03:40.040- 03:45.680* :  The US president who had been poised to fight a second term instead took to the stage to
*03:45.720- 03:46.800* :  pass on the torch.
*03:47.140- 03:51.540* :  I'm on Tim understand that this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities.
*03:51.760- 03:57.120* :  I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Waltz have Kamala ever seen.
*03:57.640- 04:02.640* :  Joe Biden attacked Donald Trump's vision for the future and said America is now at a
*04:02.640- 04:03.560* :  moral crossroads.
*04:03.780- 04:10.300* :  You've heard me say before we're facing an inflection point one of those rare moments
*04:10.300- 04:17.480* :  in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the
*04:17.480- 04:17.840* :  world.
*04:18.860- 04:21.100* :  We're in a battle for the very sole America.
*04:21.940- 04:27.500* :  The arena is to capacity for this moment people are being turned away at the door and
*04:27.500- 04:33.300* :  you can feel the warmth in the crowd for Joe Biden Democrats who were once in despair
*04:33.300- 04:39.120* :  about his failings a tonight full of appreciation and what we're watching right now is essentially
*04:39.120- 04:40.240* :  Joe Biden's goodbye.
*04:43.020- 04:49.080* :  There was a standing evasion for Hillary Clinton who fought and lost to Donald Trump in 2016
*04:50.080- 04:53.080* :  and knows what it's like to be on the end of his personal attacks.
*04:53.460- 04:58.100* :  So it is no surprise is it that he is lying about Kamala's record.
*04:58.880- 05:01.540* :  He's mocking her name and her laugh.
*05:02.580- 05:03.380* :  Sounds familiar.
*05:03.840- 05:08.480* :  Polling indicates Kamala Harris is now leading Donald Trump in key battleground states.
*05:09.220- 05:12.180* :  But Hillary Clinton warned the party not to be complacent.
*05:12.340- 05:14.820* :  We have him on the run now.
*05:15.520- 05:22.660* :  No matter what the polls say we can't let up outside the arena tens of thousands of people
*05:22.660- 05:27.760* :  marched over the war in Gaza protesting against Joe Biden's support for Israel.
*05:28.480- 05:35.180* :  Inside it featured only briefly as a popular left wing congresswoman Alexandria Cazio Cortez
*05:35.280- 05:36.420* :  called for a ceasefire.
*05:37.060- 05:44.980* :  And she is working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing pastages home.
*05:46.340- 05:54.060* :  She will fight for every woman in every girl even those who are not fighting for her.
*05:54.500- 05:59.680* :  One of the most emotive and divisive issues for America also featured in many speeches.
*06:00.440- 06:05.000* :  Kamala Harris has made a woman's right to an abortion a central part of her campaign.
*06:05.000- 06:11.240* :  Trump's actions have resulted in extreme bans on abortion even in cases of rape, incest
*06:11.560- 06:13.040* :  and non-viable pregnancies.
*06:13.760- 06:15.820* :  That fails any test of humanity.
*06:18.340- 06:22.860* :  Voters are still getting to know Kamala Harris and this week has seen as an opportunity
*06:22.860- 06:25.300* :  for her to reintroduce herself to the country.
*06:25.840- 06:31.060* :  Her nomination has turned the presidential race on its head and Democrats are thoroughly enjoying it.
*06:35.000- 06:40.440* :  That report by Emma Vardy and here with her assessment of Joe Biden's convention speech
*06:40.440- 06:42.620* :  is our America editor, Sarah Smith.
*06:43.180- 06:46.600* :  It was really, really emotional on the floor of the convention.
*06:47.060- 06:52.120* :  Almost five minutes of applause as he came on stage and he looked really, really moved
*06:52.160- 06:53.000* :  by that as well.
*06:53.020- 06:58.060* :  You had the sense that you were about to watch quite a significant political moment.
*06:58.060- 07:02.600* :  He was effectively saying goodbye even though he's got five months left in his presidency.
*07:03.200- 07:08.920* :  This was the opportunity for his party to say thank you to him for over 50 years of elected
*07:08.920- 07:12.380* :  public service as well as his one term as president.
*07:13.580- 07:19.020* :  There was a very high expectation and I'm sorry to say I just don't think the speech measured
*07:19.020- 07:19.220* :  up.
*07:19.620- 07:24.760* :  It was a pretty boilerplate recitation of the things he has achieved in office and by
*07:24.760- 07:29.540* :  the time he got to the end of it he was praising Kamala Harris as you heard there but he
*07:29.540- 07:33.740* :  didn't sound like a man who was happy to hand over the reins to be perfectly honest.
*07:33.740- 07:39.520* :  He did say that he loved the job as president but he just loved his country more and I just
*07:39.520- 07:44.740* :  didn't think he gave the sense of having actually come to terms with the idea that he was
*07:44.740- 07:49.860* :  pushed aside effectively for a younger candidate because his party felt he was too old, voters
*07:49.860- 07:52.060* :  thought he was too old to carry on.
*07:52.540- 07:58.140* :  It was dignified but it wasn't a particularly gracious way of saying goodbye I didn't think.
*07:58.400- 08:04.240* :  You got the sense that he was not at ease with the decision that he feels that he was pushed
*08:04.300- 08:04.680* :  into.
*08:05.260- 08:10.300* :  Kamala Harris herself made a surprise appearance shortly before him and she was full of
*08:10.300- 08:12.740* :  praise for Joe Biden and the amazing job he'd done.
*08:13.280- 08:17.760* :  He didn't as he was running through all of the things that he's achieved in office, all
*08:17.760- 08:20.180* :  of the important pieces of legislation that have been passed.
*08:20.440- 08:25.920* :  He wasn't weaving her role in that through this story, it wasn't as though he was telling
*08:25.920- 08:29.320* :  this tale in a way that he was handing the reins over to her.
*08:29.660- 08:34.840* :  She came on stage at the very end and there was a moment when they embraced where you could
*08:34.840- 08:35.260* :  see it.
*08:35.380- 08:40.480* :  It was a visual demonstration of the pattern being passed from Joe Biden to a younger
*08:40.480- 08:45.620* :  generation and to a new candidate and that was quite an affecting moment when you saw
*08:45.620- 08:46.060* :  it there.
*08:46.180- 08:50.260* :  But yeah, the speech was not infused with that sense I wouldn't say.
*08:51.500- 08:52.040* :  Sarah Smith.
*08:52.720- 08:58.400* :  Well, even as the US's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken tries to talk up the prospects of an
*08:58.400- 09:04.120* :  end to the war in Gaza on his latest peace mission, the violence there has continued
*09:04.360- 09:04.880* :  unabated.
*09:04.880- 09:09.880* :  The Hamas run civil defence authorities say in Israeli air strike on a school housing
*09:09.880- 09:13.980* :  displaced families near Gaza City has killed at least 10 Palestinians.
*09:14.680- 09:18.960* :  Israel's military says it struck a Hamas militant base embedded inside the school.
*09:19.400- 09:23.240* :  This comes as the Israeli army says it's retrieved the bodies of six men who were taken
*09:23.240- 09:24.980* :  hostage last year by Hamas.
*09:25.500- 09:29.280* :  Up to 70 hostages are still thought to be alive in Gaza.
*09:29.840- 09:34.080* :  Their families have accused the government of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*09:34.540- 09:37.900* :  of abandoning the hostages to safeguard its own survival.
*09:38.620- 09:43.980* :  The nephew of one of the six dead men, Zahiro Shah-Maw, accused Mr. Netanyahu's government
*09:43.980- 09:48.140* :  of repeatedly blocking attempts to secure the release of the hostages.
*09:48.800- 09:52.860* :  They had plenty of opportunities to get him out together with all the other hostages,
*09:52.860- 10:01.000* :  together with in so many cases we have counted 18 cases of the government of Israel torpedoing
*10:01.000- 10:05.160* :  the initiative to get the hostages back 18 in the last 10 months.
*10:06.020- 10:12.680* :  So yeah, there's, well, caught between rock and a hard place, you know, the Hamas and
*10:12.680- 10:19.860* :  the Israeli government both contributing their part to the death of my uncle.
*10:21.420- 10:25.780* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem, John Donetson, told us more about the six dead men whose
*10:25.780- 10:26.940* :  bodies had been recovered.
*10:27.800- 10:32.860* :  Well the Israeli military and the Shinbet, Israel's intelligence agency, say the bodies were
*10:32.860- 10:37.580* :  recovered in Harnunis in the southern Gaza Strip.
*10:37.800- 10:45.460* :  They were Yagev Buchstab, Alexander Danzig, Avram Mundar, Yorametska, Haimperi, and Nadav
*10:45.460- 10:48.780* :  Popolwell, who had British Israeli citizenship.
*10:48.780- 10:55.800* :  All of them apart from Avram Mundar, who was 79, were already presumed dead.
*10:55.880- 11:02.560* :  We don't know when they died or the circumstances in which they died or exactly
*11:02.560- 11:05.100* :  where the bodies were recovered from.
*11:05.100- 11:10.220* :  We have had a statement this morning from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*11:10.220- 11:16.620* :  who of course has faced criticism from some of the hostage families for not doing enough
*11:16.620- 11:22.340* :  to free the remaining people being held in Gaza, but he said this morning our hearts
*11:22.340- 11:24.900* :  grieve over the terrible loss.
*11:25.580- 11:31.820* :  And this gives extra impetus to the efforts to try to free the remaining hostages, but
*11:31.820- 11:38.080* :  at the same time, we're also hearing about more Palestinian deaths, including a school
*11:38.080- 11:38.680* :  in Gaza.
*11:39.600- 11:40.000* :  That's right.
*11:40.000- 11:47.320* :  A school in Gaza City, which was housing around 700 displaced people, according to
*11:47.320- 11:53.300* :  the Civil Defense Authorities in Gaza, those same authorities say that 10 people were
*11:53.300- 12:00.560* :  killed and dozens injured in an Israeli strike on the school this morning, Israel has issued
*12:00.560- 12:07.180* :  a statement saying that they targeted what they said was a Hamas command and control center
*12:07.640- 12:09.320* :  embedded within the school.
*12:09.320- 12:15.320* :  Hamas has always denied that it is embedding its operatives within schools and hospitals
*12:15.320- 12:19.020* :  and the like, but Israel clearly disputes that.
*12:19.520- 12:23.700* :  And this is not the first time a school has been targeted by Israel.
*12:23.700- 12:30.940* :  The UN says hundreds have been hit over the past 10 months of conflict in Gaza.
*12:31.300- 12:37.280* :  And as you say, this comes when those pushing for a ceasefire deal and hostage release
*12:37.280- 12:44.980* :  deal, Anthony Blinken urging all sides to refrain from actions that would escalate tensions
*12:44.980- 12:49.480* :  and we've not really seen that from either side, to be honest.
*12:50.120- 12:55.420* :  Young Donnerson in Jerusalem India's Supreme Court has ordered the setting up of a task
*12:55.420- 13:00.240* :  force to improve the safety of health workers as protests continue over the rape and murder
*13:00.240- 13:03.560* :  of a junior doctor earlier this month while she was at work.
*13:04.040- 13:08.560* :  The court also told federal police to submit a report on the investigation into the killing
*13:08.560- 13:10.120* :  at a hospital in Kolkata.
*13:10.700- 13:13.720* :  The father of the murder doctor has been talking to the BBC.
*13:14.420- 13:19.060* :  To protect the family's identity, his words have been voiced by a BBC colleague.
*13:19.780- 13:23.580* :  We come from a lower class background and we built up everything by ourselves.
*13:23.700- 13:28.200* :  And suddenly now at the age of 62, all my dreams have been shattered.
*13:28.960- 13:31.120* :  We want the harshest punishment for this.
*13:31.640- 13:35.480* :  Our state, our country, even the whole world is asking for justice.
*13:36.040- 13:40.100* :  And I am mentioning the role of the hospital because whenever she used to leave for work,
*13:40.500- 13:44.840* :  we would remain tense until she called and informed us that she had reached the hospital
*13:45.400- 13:45.420* :  safely.
*13:45.840- 13:47.600* :  Only then we would feel relieved.
*13:48.000- 13:53.340* :  And the hospital is the place where something so barbaric happened to her while on duty.
*13:54.020- 13:58.260* :  All of our relatives and neighbours used to tell me, you managed to make your daughter
*13:58.260- 14:03.740* :  a doctor only by running a tailoring shop and I used to say no, I did not make her.
*14:04.020- 14:06.960* :  But she became a doctor through her own hard work.
*14:07.320- 14:08.820* :  We just provided some support.
*14:09.300- 14:10.660* :  The effort was all hers.
*14:11.100- 14:15.800* :  That was the father of a doctor murdered in an Indian hospital talking to the BBC.
*14:18.660- 14:19.240* :  Still to come?
*14:19.560- 14:25.280* :  I go downstairs and when I approach the reception of my building, I get handcuffed.
*14:25.560- 14:29.680* :  That was take to the tension and I stay there for 44 days.
*14:30.460- 14:34.340* :  A gay man warns others to be careful if they visit Qatar.
*14:42.040- 14:45.020* :  Ryan Reynolds here for I guess my hundreds mid commercial.
*14:45.100- 14:47.240* :  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*14:48.340- 14:51.020* :  You know, honestly when I started this I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.
*14:51.220- 14:54.500* :  I mean it's unlimited, premium wireless for $15 a month.
*14:54.620- 14:57.520* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*14:58.120- 14:59.600* :  I'm sorry I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*14:59.900- 15:04.060* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.

*15:14.500- 15:20.400* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time when he was the biggest star
*15:20.400- 15:21.600* :  in all the world.
*15:22.220- 15:27.200* :  But something happened, not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
*15:27.800- 15:30.700* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.

*15:51.580- 15:56.500* :  Police in Kenya say a man accused of murdering 42 women has escaped from custody.
*15:57.260- 16:01.600* :  Collins, Jumezi Kalusha, was among a group of about a dozen detainees who were set to
*16:01.600- 16:04.060* :  have cut through a fence at a police station in Nairobi.
*16:04.600- 16:05.840* :  Ian Wafula reports.
*16:06.480- 16:11.080* :  A police spokesperson said Collins, Jumezi Kalusha and 12 others had escaped by cutting
*16:11.080- 16:14.560* :  through wire mesh at the police station and scaling a perimeter wall.
*16:15.120- 16:19.460* :  Last month, the police said Mr. Kalusha had confessed to murdering 42 women, including
*16:19.460- 16:20.280* :  his own wife.
*16:20.820- 16:24.720* :  They said mutilated bodies were found at a rubbish dump in the capital, Nairobi.
*16:25.260- 16:29.100* :  However, a defence lawyer later told the court that he had been tortured and co-assed
*16:29.100- 16:30.280* :  into making the confession.
*16:30.920- 16:35.140* :  Rights groups want an independent investigation to rule out any police involvement in the
*16:35.160- 16:35.700* :  killings.
*16:36.900- 16:37.640* :  Ian Wafula.
*16:38.500- 16:44.200* :  The BBC has heard testimony from what may be one of the worst incidents of mass killings
*16:44.240- 16:45.780* :  in Myanmar's civil war.
*16:46.300- 16:51.540* :  Hundreds of civilians from the Rahinga Muslim community were bombed on August 5th as they
*16:51.540- 16:52.760* :  tried to flee the conflict.
*16:53.320- 16:56.840* :  It's the latest in the history of deadly violence against the Rahinga people.
*16:57.540- 17:03.280* :  In 2017, thousands were killed in what was described by the UN as ethnic cleansing at the
*17:03.280- 17:04.600* :  hands of the country's military.
*17:05.420- 17:10.080* :  In recent months, scores of Rahinga Muslims have been killed and thousands have fled to
*17:10.080- 17:14.380* :  Bangladesh from neighbouring Myanmar, but now they say they're also being attacked by
*17:14.380- 17:19.560* :  the other side, those fighting the military, the rebel group Arakhan Army.
*17:20.080- 17:25.860* :  Yogi Talimayi reports from Tecnaf in Bangladesh, just to warn you her report contains some
*17:25.860- 17:27.220* :  distressing descriptions.
*17:29.560- 17:32.920* :  I'm standing on the Bangladeshi side of the Nath River.
*17:33.760- 17:38.240* :  This is the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar in this part of the country.
*17:38.900- 17:44.680* :  And across on the other side, I can see Myanmar's Rakhine state, specifically the Mondeur
*17:44.720- 17:45.120* :  town.
*17:45.520- 17:49.800* :  That's where we know there have been violent attacks against Rahinga Muslims in recent
*17:50.200- 17:50.440* :  months.
*17:52.280- 17:56.940* :  Several of them have told us that they're being attacked by the ethnic rebel group, the
*17:57.060- 17:57.740* :  Arakhan Army.
*17:58.940- 18:05.480* :  What we're specifically looking into is an incident which took place on the 5th of August,
*18:06.560- 18:13.360* :  where we're told by many eyewitnesses and survivors that potentially as many as 200
*18:13.360- 18:23.120* :  Rahinga Muslims were killed by drone strikes and other bombs every day, at least four
*18:23.120- 18:28.000* :  or five boatloads of Rahingers are arriving here.
*18:28.000- 18:32.580* :  They come in the dead of the night so that they're not arrested by Bangladeshi security
*18:32.580- 18:34.960* :  forces who might send them back.
*18:35.620- 18:42.240* :  Among them is a man who witnessed what happened on the 5th of August on that day and he's
*18:42.240- 18:44.740* :  lost pretty much everyone in his family.
*18:45.460- 18:51.440* :  His two children, a son and a daughter, his wife, his mother, his sister, three of his
*18:51.440- 18:57.680* :  sister's children and we're going to go to find out now what exactly happened on that
*18:57.700- 18:57.920* :  day.
*19:03.620- 19:06.820* :  The Arakhan Army dropped bombs on us using drones.
*19:07.580- 19:14.600* :  We heard a loud sound and an explosion, we've thrown on the ground, I, my wife, my mother,
*19:14.600- 19:19.020* :  my daughter, son and sister were there when the bombs struck.
*19:19.700- 19:25.480* :  All of them died, I don't know why I survived, my daughter died in my arms.
*19:30.820- 19:34.460* :  He showed us a video he found online of the aftermath of the bombing.
*19:37.680- 19:43.580* :  In it, you can hear a man crying and saying, all of the people who died, it's distressing
*19:43.580- 19:47.620* :  to watch but it's crucial evidence of what appears to be a massacre.
*19:49.380- 19:52.800* :  The ground is covered with bodies, many of them are children.
*19:54.840- 20:00.960* :  The man's wife who was fatally injured but alive is visible in the video, so is his sister.
*20:01.520- 20:04.680* :  He wasn't able to carry them out, they died later.
*20:06.740- 20:09.680* :  The Rohingyas are among the most persecuted communities in the world.
*20:09.680- 20:14.580* :  In 2017, thousands were killed in Myanmar and a million fled to Bangladesh.
*20:15.300- 20:18.120* :  At the time, the violence was carried out by the military.
*20:19.620- 20:24.360* :  I've come to one of the densely packed, squalid camps they are still living in in Bangladesh,
*20:24.960- 20:27.200* :  home's temporary bamboo structures here.
*20:27.820- 20:32.740* :  I've come to meet one of the survivors of the 5th August attack who's hiding in a home
*20:32.780- 20:33.040* :  here.
*20:33.600- 20:36.760* :  His parents, children and wife were killed.
*20:41.280- 20:43.820* :  I have no words to describe how I feel.
*20:44.720- 20:46.460* :  I miss my family so much.
*20:47.240- 20:52.120* :  Every time I think about the beautiful life I had, I burst into tears.
*20:52.700- 20:56.380* :  The drones that hit us were fired by Arcan army.
*20:57.020- 21:02.000* :  In these camps we've spoken to more than a dozen survivors, all of whom have told us they
*21:02.000- 21:05.080* :  were deliberately attacked by the Arcan army.
*21:05.840- 21:10.080* :  In response to the BBC, the group has said that the attack didn't happen in the area
*21:10.080- 21:13.460* :  under their control and that they have no connection with it.
*21:14.300- 21:19.640* :  The Arcan army has been making rapid advances in the Rakhine state and it's projected itself
*21:19.640- 21:25.500* :  as a resistance group that's fighting for the people against the military hunter.
*21:26.300- 21:31.520* :  But from what we've heard here now, it faces credible accusations of the mass killing
*21:31.520- 21:32.360* :  of civilians.
*21:33.220- 21:36.400* :  And there are calls for it to be investigated for war crimes.
*21:40.220- 21:44.660* :  I've asked here if we can make a phone call to somebody who's over in Mondeau to get
*21:45.260- 21:46.340* :  a sense of the situation.
*21:50.280- 21:50.420* :  Hello?
*21:50.420- 21:56.120* :  We're not naming the man we called to protect him.
*21:56.800- 22:02.040* :  He tells me the Arcan army has forcibly taken people out of their homes and are keeping
*22:02.040- 22:05.040* :  them together in schools, mosques and other shelters.
*22:06.440- 22:11.360* :  The group has said it's evacuating people to keep them safe from the ongoing civil war.
*22:11.940- 22:16.400* :  But the man rejects their claim, breaking down as he explains his condition.
*22:19.940- 22:20.700* :  I'm 65.
*22:20.700- 22:23.220* :  Both my mother and I are ill.
*22:23.880- 22:28.160* :  But we cannot move out of here because if we do, the Arcan army will shoot us.
*22:28.440- 22:29.820* :  Please save us if we can.
*22:31.800- 22:35.740* :  One Myanmar's Rakhine state, the military hunter, is losing ground rapidly.
*22:36.160- 22:40.320* :  They should have given hope to raringers of a possible return to their land.
*22:40.920- 22:46.940* :  Instead, for the hundreds of thousands still living in Myanmar, once again, it's a precarious
*22:46.980- 22:47.440* :  moment.
*22:48.940- 22:50.980* :  That report by Yuki Te Lemaye.
*22:51.740- 22:55.820* :  It was always difficult and dangerous to try to escape from North Korea, one of the most
*22:55.820- 22:59.000* :  repressive, heavily guarded and isolated countries in the world.
*22:59.500- 23:04.860* :  For the pandemic, all the numbers of defectors to the much more prosperous South plummet, fewer
*23:04.860- 23:08.100* :  than 200 North Koreans managed to escape last year.
*23:08.400- 23:14.320* :  But now, in an even rarer event, a North Korean soldier has walked across a demilitarized
*23:14.320- 23:16.020* :  zone that separates the two countries.
*23:16.740- 23:19.980* :  Asia-Pacific regional editor Jason Lee told us more.
*23:20.760- 23:25.780* :  So what we do know is that the soldiers believe to be a staff surgeon who was working in
*23:25.780- 23:31.480* :  that demilitarized zone, the DMZ, and walked, as you say, this heavily fortified border
*23:31.480- 23:36.000* :  in Ko-Zong County and Gangwon Province, which is a very mountainous region in the east
*23:36.040- 23:40.120* :  of the Korean Peninsula, and made clear their intention to defect.
*23:40.560- 23:44.940* :  Now, not much many details are being released for security reasons, obviously.
*23:44.940- 23:50.780* :  But the South Korean military said it detected the soldier making its way south within the
*23:50.780- 23:56.600* :  DMZ and conducted an operation to aid their safe arrival in South Korea, and the soldier
*23:56.600- 24:00.740* :  is now being questioned by authorities and will go through a rigorous fetting procedure.
*24:01.040- 24:03.760* :  And how common are such defections?
*24:04.280- 24:09.680* :  Nearly 200 defected to South Korea last year, but compared to before the COVID pandemic,
*24:10.180- 24:15.860* :  when in 2019 there were more than 1,000 defections that number has plummeted in recent years.
*24:16.180- 24:17.400* :  Now there are mainly two reasons.
*24:17.400- 24:20.840* :  During the pandemic, North Korea effectively shut down its borders.
*24:21.380- 24:26.100* :  Secondly, it's because the most common route to defect from North Korea, which is the border
*24:26.100- 24:31.100* :  with China up in the North, it's being heavily fortified in recent years by the North Korean
*24:31.100- 24:33.560* :  authorities making more difficult to escape.
*24:33.960- 24:39.060* :  It's a very difficult journey, sometimes very perilous, but even when they manage to get
*24:39.060- 24:44.220* :  to South Korea, for many North Koreans, life is very difficult, it's very difficult for
*24:44.220- 24:47.020* :  them to integrate into what is a very different society.
*24:47.620- 24:48.120* :  That's correct.
*24:48.260- 24:53.180* :  So before I just elaborate a bit, it's worth mentioning out of more than 30,000 North
*24:53.180- 24:57.960* :  Koreans who defected, who live in South Korea, most of them have successfully integrated
*24:57.960- 25:02.280* :  from the help of the government, but as you say many find it difficult, two reasons
*25:02.280- 25:03.080* :  again for this.
*25:03.480- 25:07.560* :  First, as you say, very different society, South Korea is a capitalist society, North Korea
*25:07.560- 25:11.260* :  is a communist one, and it's not all paradise for North Koreans.
*25:11.260- 25:16.000* :  It's a very competitive society, and many just cannot compete with this well-educated
*25:16.000- 25:18.340* :  South Koreans, you know, they don't have to skill set.
*25:18.820- 25:23.440* :  Secondly, I've spoken to numerous North Koreans defectors, and many of them tell me that
*25:23.460- 25:25.980* :  they missed their family members back in North Korean.
*25:26.000- 25:29.520* :  They feel a sense of guilt because they are able to eat all these good food and have
*25:29.520- 25:33.980* :  a nice life in South Korea while their family members, who they might never be able to
*25:33.980- 25:37.760* :  see again, are still going through such hardship and they just don't know what the fate of
*25:37.760- 25:38.880* :  their family members are like.
*25:39.780- 25:45.840* :  Jason Lee, a gay British Mexican man who spent 44 days in prison in Qatar has
*25:45.840- 25:50.120* :  warned other LGBT people to be careful in visiting the country.
*25:50.800- 25:56.420* :  In an exclusive BBC interview, Manuel Guerrero Avinia, who was arrested after an undercover
*25:56.420- 26:02.200* :  policing on the gay dating app grinder, says he has no doubt he was targeted for his
*26:02.200- 26:05.820* :  sexuality, and that he fears what happened to him could happen to anyone.
*26:06.660- 26:11.300* :  International human rights groups have raised concerns over the case and called the subsequent
*26:11.300- 26:13.160* :  trial grossly unfair.
*26:13.600- 26:18.960* :  The Qatar officials insist Mr. Avinia's arrest was solely about drug offenses.
*26:19.500- 26:23.620* :  Our LGBT and identity reporter Josh Parry has this report.
*26:26.080- 26:31.320* :  I'm free, I'm completely free, I can be myself, and I can be against around it, like
*26:31.320- 26:34.920* :  so many friends, and people who are supporting my case.
*26:35.520- 26:40.480* :  To Manuel Guerrero Avinia, a trip to London Soho represents freedom.
*26:40.780- 26:46.540* :  It's about seeing people happy, seeing people hugging each other, you know, sharing and
*26:46.540- 26:49.380* :  enjoying, yes, enjoying life, basically.
*26:49.860- 26:55.160* :  As the British capital's hotspot for LGBT nightlife, it's a world away from Qatar, where
*26:55.160- 26:56.360* :  it's illegal to be gay.
*26:56.760- 27:01.460* :  He spent the last seven years living in Qatar, but in February, he was arrested after
*27:01.460- 27:04.100* :  arranging to meet a man he'd been messaging online.
*27:04.920- 27:08.540* :  It turned out to be a fake account, ran by undercover police.
*27:08.820- 27:14.620* :  I go downstairs, and when I approach the reception of my of my building, I get handcuffed.
*27:14.900- 27:19.060* :  I was taken to detention, and I stay there for 44 days.
*27:19.520- 27:25.140* :  It was horrific to see people being whipped on their backs, and then I was threatened to
*27:25.140- 27:28.820* :  suffer the same treatment if I did not have a sign confession.
*27:29.360- 27:33.440* :  Of course, a confession written in Arabic that, you know, I could not read.
*27:34.760- 27:38.720* :  Manuel was eventually released from prison on the condition he handed over his passport.
*27:39.500- 27:44.400* :  In June, he was given a six-month suspended sentence at a trial in Doha's Al-Sad criminal
*27:44.400- 27:44.840* :  court.
*27:45.540- 27:50.780* :  He was also fined 2,100 British pounds, and was subject to a deportation order.
*27:51.120- 27:57.120* :  I do not accept the charges, and again, all the questions, all the interrogations were
*27:57.120- 27:59.720* :  solely focused on my sexual preferences.
*27:59.720- 28:04.160* :  They wanted to know, since when I've been having sex, with whom I've been having sex,
*28:04.600- 28:09.620* :  if this was a drug case, they would be asking, you know, where did you get the substances
*28:09.620- 28:11.180* :  that they claim they are mine?
*28:11.240- 28:14.900* :  But the case, the full interrogation was about sexual preferences.
*28:15.460- 28:20.560* :  Why do you use apps like Grindr and Tinder to meet men when you know that it's illegal?
*28:21.120- 28:24.540* :  In Qatar, there is no gay clubs, there is no place to meet people.
*28:24.940- 28:28.080* :  Using the apps doesn't mean that you are going to have sex.
*28:28.360- 28:32.880* :  You're just meeting other people from the community, so I was a bit, you know, on the
*28:32.880- 28:36.020* :  understanding that it was okay as long as you do it behind doors.
*28:36.760- 28:41.360* :  Before his arrest earlier this year, Manuel had never been in trouble with cataray authorities.
*28:42.460- 28:46.540* :  International human rights organisations have raised concerns about his case.
*28:47.360- 28:52.520* :  James Lynch is a former British diplomat in Qatar, and co-director of human rights organisations
*28:52.760- 28:53.460* :  for Asquire.
*28:53.960- 28:58.520* :  Just in the last three years, we've dealt with several cases of people who've been arrested
*28:58.520- 29:03.920* :  and then interrogated without a lawyer, without being able to see their embassy.
*29:04.740- 29:08.100* :  Manuel was clearly targeted because he was LGBT.
*29:08.860- 29:11.120* :  This is what this case has always been about.
*29:12.200- 29:16.620* :  He was targeted through Grindr and that primarily used by the LGBT community.
*29:17.140- 29:21.560* :  Cataray officials told the BBC, Manuel was arrested for possessing an illegal substance
*29:22.200- 29:24.880* :  and that no other factors were considered when making the arrest.
*29:25.720- 29:30.780* :  They said he was treated with dignity and respect during his detention and that Mr Guerrero
*29:30.780- 29:35.620* :  Ovenia and his family have made numerous false allegations in an attempt to generate public
*29:35.620- 29:37.300* :  sympathy and support for his case.
*29:37.980- 29:44.280* :  What about people who like yourself or LGBT British nationals or from elsewhere that
*29:44.280- 29:46.660* :  are thinking about or already live in Qatar?
*29:47.220- 29:48.440* :  What would you say to them?
*29:48.720- 29:53.540* :  I would say be careful, although there are some written rules, I would just share a message
*29:53.540- 29:56.140* :  of being careful and look after themselves.
*29:57.020- 30:00.080* :  I never thought this would happen to me, it could happen to anyone.
*30:01.440- 30:04.880* :  Manuel Guerrero Ovenia talking to Josh Perry.
*30:06.180- 30:11.180* :  A European space agency spacecraft, which is on a mission to the planet Jupiter, is taking
*30:11.180- 30:16.360* :  part in what scientists are calling a world-first double gravity assisted flyby.
*30:16.940- 30:21.700* :  The manoeuvre is using the Earth's gravity and the moons to propel the craft known as
*30:21.700- 30:27.220* :  juice, which stands for Jupiter, I see moons explorer towards the solar system's biggest
*30:27.220- 30:27.640* :  planet.
*30:28.100- 30:31.620* :  Dr Caroline Harper, who is the head of the UK Space Agency, explains.
*30:32.460- 30:38.500* :  Juice flew by the moon last night, very close, it got really close about 700 kilometres
*30:38.500- 30:45.000* :  from the moon and it's now heading towards Earth for a close flyby of Earth as well.
*30:45.000- 30:50.220* :  So this is a double flyby, lunar Earth flyby that's never been done before, because it's
*30:50.220- 30:56.980* :  a very risky procedure, and that what it does is it adjusts the speed and the trajectory
*30:56.980- 31:03.180* :  of the spacecraft and sends it on a very convoluted pathway towards Jupiter.
*31:03.740- 31:07.080* :  You would think, wouldn't you, that it would be a straight line, would be the most efficient
*31:07.080- 31:11.680* :  way to get there, just go in a straight line from here to Jupiter, but that's not the case,
*31:11.680- 31:17.620* :  counterintuitively, if we go on as sort of a scenic route and use the gravity of the moon
*31:17.680- 31:22.580* :  and Earth, and then it'll be Venus next, this is actually more efficient, saves a lot
*31:22.580- 31:22.980* :  of fuel.
*31:23.980- 31:28.940* :  Dr Caroline Harper, and in case you're wondering, it's due to arrive at Jupiter in the year
*31:28.940- 31:35.260* :  2031, after a journey of more than 6 and a half billion kilometres.
*31:37.880- 31:41.560* :  And that's all for most of now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast
*31:41.560- 31:42.000* :  later.
*31:42.300- 31:46.360* :  If you want to comment on this podcast, you can send us an email, the address is global
*31:46.360- 31:52.260* :  podcast at bbc.co.uk, you can also find us on x at global news pod.
*31:52.840- 31:57.240* :  This addition was mixed by Chris Murphy, the producer was Rachel Wright, the editor is
*31:57.300- 31:57.900* :  Karen Martin.
*31:58.380- 32:00.360* :  I'm Janet Gillil, until next time, goodbye.
*32:09.480- 32:10.940* :  We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right?
*32:11.860- 32:17.280* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather, and there was a time when he was the biggest
*32:17.280- 32:23.900* :  star in all the world, but something happened, not just to him, but to hundreds of artists
*32:24.040- 32:24.600* :  in Hollywood.
*32:24.600- 32:28.040* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.
*32:29.040- 32:34.580* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
*32:35.260- 32:38.240* :  Search for Hollywood Exiles, wherever you get your podcasts.
