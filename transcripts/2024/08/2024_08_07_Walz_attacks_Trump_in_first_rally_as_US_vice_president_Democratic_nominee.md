*01:29.300- 01:32.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:34.640- 01:39.280* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Wednesday 7 August. These are our main stories.
*01:39.340- 01:44.980* :  The US Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, the Governor of Minnesota Tim Walls,
*01:44.980- 01:49.160* :  have kicked off their campaign for November's election at a rally in Philadelphia.
*01:50.000- 01:54.480* :  The Nobel Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus, has been named as the leader of Bangladesh's new interim
*01:54.480- 02:00.480* :  government. The man who Israel says was the architect of the October 7th attacks Yaya Sinwa
*02:00.720- 02:06.080* :  has become the new political leader of Hamas, replacing Ismar Hania, who was assassinated in Iran.
*02:08.980- 02:12.100* :  Also in this podcast, the basic plan was very simple.
*02:12.760- 02:15.180* :  I know there was going to be a team in each tower.
*02:15.860- 02:20.340* :  50 years ago, the French high-wire artist Philippe Petit walked using a cable
*02:20.340- 02:25.640* :  stronger legally between the twin towers in New York. To commemorate that, he's doing another
*02:25.640- 02:33.860* :  performance rather closer to the ground. Let's begin in the US City of Philadelphia.
*02:39.360- 02:44.620* :  At an election rally attended by thousands of people, the US Vice President and now presidential
*02:44.620- 02:49.680* :  nominee Kamala Harris, appeared with her newly selected running mate, the Governor of Minnesota,
*02:49.680- 02:54.900* :  Tim Walls. The Democratic presidential candidate announced her choice earlier on Tuesday.
*02:54.940- 03:00.560* :  Tim Walls is known for his progressive policies and his plain speaking. He's made an impact on
*03:00.560- 03:04.780* :  social media in recent weeks by labeling former President Trump and his running mate,
*03:04.780- 03:10.900* :  JD Vance, as weird. The Trump campaign has immediately dismissed Mr. Walls as a dangerously
*03:10.900- 03:15.800* :  liberal extremist. At a few minutes after appearing on the podium, Kamala Harris outlined
*03:15.800- 03:21.060* :  her experience, including her role as courtroom prosecutor, repeating an earlier mantra regarding
*03:21.060- 03:27.240* :  Donald Trump. So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
*03:32.620- 03:41.420* :  Predators who abused women, fraudsters who scanned consumers,
*03:44.720- 03:47.200* :  cheaters who broke the rules for their own game.
*03:50.840- 03:52.620* :  So hear me when I say,
*04:03.740- 04:06.240* :  I know Donald Trump's type.
*04:13.520- 04:16.700* :  And this was the first we heard from her new running mate, Tim Walls.
*04:16.840- 04:20.280* :  Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us.
*04:24.060- 04:26.580* :  First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service.
*04:32.280- 04:35.180* :  He doesn't have time for it because he's too busy serving himself.
*04:39.460- 04:45.280* :  Again and again and again, Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand.
*04:47.700- 04:51.860* :  He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division,
*04:51.860- 04:56.220* :  and that's to say nothing of his record as president.
*04:56.540- 05:01.540* :  Tim Walls speaking in Philadelphia. The Kamala Harris campaign hopes this midwesternal
*05:01.540- 05:06.440* :  will appeal to an independent and conservative minded voter. This from our international editor,
*05:06.840- 05:11.680* :  Jeremy Bowen. Breaking news, vice president Kamala Harris chooses Minnesota,
*05:11.680- 05:15.080* :  governor Tim Walls as a running mate. Until a few weeks ago,
*05:15.080- 05:19.500* :  governor Tim Walls of Minnesota was barely known to voters outside his own state.
*05:20.440- 05:26.680* :  He burst onto the national scene in a series of highly effective appearances on cable news channels.
*05:26.680- 05:31.100* :  Well, it's true, these guys are just weird. They're running for
*05:31.100- 05:34.440* :  key man women haters club or something. That's what they go at.
*05:34.620- 05:36.420* :  That's not what people are interested in.
*05:36.700- 05:40.660* :  Calling the Republicans weird is a tag that seems to have hit home.
*05:40.660- 05:43.180* :  These guys are just weird, that's for the government.
*05:43.300- 05:48.540* :  Governor Walls trades politically on being an authentic product of America's heartland.
*05:49.020- 05:53.540* :  He grew up in a small town, served in the National Guard for more than 20 years,
*05:54.060- 05:58.600* :  and was a high school teacher and football coach before he went into politics.
*05:58.600- 06:02.540* :  At 60, he's around the same age as Kamala Harris.
*06:03.140- 06:06.420* :  All that helped him rise above his better known rivals.
*06:07.300- 06:10.700* :  Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, was a favorite.
*06:11.360- 06:17.320* :  She needs to win his state, but Mr. Shapiro's strong support for Israel might have been a vote
*06:17.320- 06:21.180* :  loser elsewhere. Donald Trump and the Republicans are trying to frame
*06:21.180- 06:25.400* :  Vice President Harris as a dangerous liberal from California.
*06:25.640- 06:29.760* :  Tim Walls will be a rubber stamp for Kamala's dangerously liberal agenda.
*06:30.020- 06:33.000* :  In a taste of what's already a bitter close campaign,
*06:33.000- 06:37.580* :  the Republicans are choosing Mr. Walls of faking his heartland credentials.
*06:37.740- 06:44.020* :  Mr. Trump posted that the would be Vice President would unleash hell on earth.
*06:44.200- 06:49.040* :  Kamala Harris has transformed the Democratic campaign since she replaced Joe Biden
*06:49.040- 06:53.900* :  as candidate for President, up in the polls and raising millions of dollars.
*06:54.500- 07:01.000* :  Selecting Governor Tim Walls helps sustain a sense of momentum and the touring key states this week.
*07:02.040- 07:08.180* :  The U.S. presidential race turns on a handful of states that swing between the two main parties.
*07:08.720- 07:13.680* :  The Democrats must hope that Mr. Walls will appeal to working class white voters
*07:13.680- 07:20.680* :  who've turned towards Donald Trump and the Republicans, but in the end, the record shows
*07:20.680- 07:26.400* :  that Americans vote for the presidential candidate, not the Vice President.
*07:26.960- 07:28.940* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*07:29.700- 07:33.360* :  The Palestinian militant group Hamas has announced its leader in Gaza,
*07:33.360- 07:36.400* :  Yaya Sinwa, will be the new head of its political bureau.
*07:37.020- 07:42.040* :  He succeeds, Ismar Hanir, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week.
*07:42.600- 07:45.580* :  Mr. Sinwa tops Israel's most wanted list.
*07:45.980- 07:51.340* :  It accuses him of authorizing the October 7th attacks in which 1200 Israelis and foreigners,
*07:51.340- 07:55.320* :  mostly civilians, were killed and 250 were taken hostage.
*07:56.040- 07:59.340* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams has more from Jerusalem.
*07:59.960- 08:05.760* :  This is clearly a gesture of total defiance from Hamas.
*08:06.200- 08:10.160* :  They have effectively said to the world and to Israel in particular,
*08:10.740- 08:17.720* :  you killed our former leader Ismar Hanir, a man who was your chief interlocutor,
*08:17.720- 08:22.700* :  a man who you were effectively, if not directly, but indirectly negotiating with.
*08:23.120- 08:24.180* :  You decided to kill him.
*08:24.220- 08:26.380* :  Well, this is what you get instead.
*08:26.900- 08:30.680* :  The man who you accuse, almost certainly with good reason,
*08:30.680- 08:35.380* :  for being the mastermind behind what happened on October 7th last year.
*08:35.880- 08:42.920* :  It is hard to see how Hamas could have chosen a more or made a more defiant move
*08:43.360- 08:48.440* :  than to appoint Yaya Sinwa, a kind of legendary figure among his followers,
*08:48.440- 08:54.420* :  a man who has stayed as far as we know, has stayed in the Gaza Strip throughout the entire
*08:54.420- 08:59.460* :  10 months of this war, a man who was glimpsed only briefly in some footage,
*09:00.000- 09:02.640* :  which the Israelis released some months ago,
*09:03.040- 09:06.200* :  in which you effectively see the back of him as he was moving through
*09:06.680- 09:08.900* :  one of those famous tunnels in Gaza.
*09:09.260- 09:14.900* :  A man who most people believe will never leave the Gaza Strip, will never abandon his fighters,
*09:14.900- 09:17.360* :  who will perhaps fight to the very end.
*09:17.820- 09:25.920* :  That is the man now in charge of Hamas, and what happens to negotiations as a result of this?
*09:25.920- 09:30.140* :  Well, Ismar Hanir is gone, the negotiations were difficult enough,
*09:30.140- 09:35.780* :  even while he was there as an intermediary, because all messages had to go via him,
*09:35.780- 09:42.360* :  and then through a kind of complicated route through either through the Qataris or the Egyptians,
*09:42.980- 09:47.640* :  and then very, very slowly and indirectly into the Gaza Strip, almost certainly messages
*09:48.060- 09:52.400* :  carried by hand until they reached Yaya Sinwa, and it was up to him then to decide what
*09:52.400- 09:56.220* :  the response was, and often the response took some time to emerge.
*09:56.780- 10:00.020* :  All of that will remain extremely difficult,
*10:00.680- 10:04.120* :  but I think as I said at the beginning, the chief message here is defiance.
*10:05.020- 10:06.260* :  Poor Adams in Jerusalem.
*10:06.920- 10:11.240* :  The Israeli military has confirmed deploying fighter jets to hit what it called a military
*10:11.240- 10:15.260* :  structure used by Hezbollah in the southern Lebanese town of Mifadoum.
*10:15.700- 10:19.080* :  The Lebanese authorities said six people had been killed in the strike.
*10:19.700- 10:24.120* :  Surely afterwards, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli military facility
*10:24.120- 10:27.880* :  on the country's northern coast. 19 Israelis were injured.
*10:28.600- 10:33.360* :  In a televised speech, the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the attack wasn't in response
*10:33.360- 10:36.740* :  to Israel's killing of a senior commander from the group last week.
*10:36.740- 10:39.840* :  He said retaliation for that attack was yet to come.
*10:40.440- 10:43.240* :  From Beirut, his our correspondent Hugo Bashaka.
*10:43.740- 10:46.100* :  Hassan Nasrallah spoke for an hour and a half.
*10:46.520- 10:50.800* :  The Hezbollah response to the Israeli assassination was coming, he said,
*10:51.220- 10:53.400* :  and it would be strong and effective.
*10:54.180- 10:57.540* :  Fawad Shukar was killed in the group's stronghold in southern Beirut,
*10:57.740- 11:02.000* :  and Nasrallah said the assassination could not be seen as any other attack.
*11:02.700- 11:07.320* :  There are concerns that this retaliation could lead to a wider conflict with Israel.
*11:07.860- 11:11.180* :  Many countries have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon immediately,
*11:11.180- 11:13.360* :  but there is no sense of panic here.
*11:13.960- 11:18.660* :  Next to Denmark, an appolished man accused of punching the Danish Prime Minister has
*11:18.660- 11:23.960* :  gone on trial in Copenhagen. The 39-year-old, who can't be named because of reporting restrictions,
*11:23.960- 11:27.720* :  has pleaded not guilty to the alleged assault which took place in June.
*11:28.320- 11:30.440* :  Adrian Murray reports from Copenhagen.
*11:31.060- 11:36.540* :  Dressed in jeans in a colourful t-shirt, the 39-year-old defendant confirmed that he had seen
*11:36.540- 11:40.900* :  and recognised the Danish Prime Minister, but in night putting a hand on her.
*11:41.320- 11:46.640* :  The man who has lived in Denmark for five years is accused of punching metaphors and shoulder
*11:47.120- 11:49.600* :  as she walked through a square in central Copenhagen.
*11:50.140- 11:52.320* :  When questioned, he denied responsibility.
*11:52.380- 11:55.260* :  Telling the court he couldn't recall the incident.
*11:55.260- 11:58.320* :  Henry Karl Nielsen is the defendant's lawyer.
*11:58.740- 12:03.640* :  Yeah, well, he remembers he met the Prime Minister in the central Copenhagen,
*12:04.320- 12:07.400* :  and actually what happened, he doesn't remember because he was drunk.
*12:07.640- 12:09.500* :  Mrs. Friedrichson has not testified.
*12:09.500- 12:15.380* :  However, a friend she was meeting for a coffee and two security guards gave evidence during the hearing.
*12:15.780- 12:19.680* :  One bodyguard told the court that the Prime Minister had been knocked off balance.
*12:19.800- 12:22.620* :  The friend said Friedrichson had been really shaken.
*12:23.360- 12:25.260* :  According to the Prime Minister's office at the time,
*12:25.260- 12:30.860* :  Friedrichson, who's 46, was left with a minor whiplash injury and had to cancel engagements.
*12:31.640- 12:34.440* :  The alleged attack occurred on the eve of the European elections,
*12:34.980- 12:37.880* :  and fought a spate of assaults against other politicians.
*12:38.520- 12:43.660* :  Counts having decent exposure and fraud were also heard by the court relating to
*12:43.660- 12:45.120* :  earlier, separate incidents.
*12:45.920- 12:47.660* :  The two-day trial wraps up on Wednesday.
*12:48.260- 12:51.400* :  If thank guilty, the accused could face a prison sentence,
*12:51.440- 12:54.840* :  deportation, and a six-year entry ban.
*12:55.520- 12:56.820* :  Adrian Murray in Denmark.
*12:59.460- 13:00.060* :  Still to come?
*13:00.460- 13:02.340* :  I lost three stone in the end,
*13:02.580- 13:05.980* :  and I haven't been on any medication now for about a year and a half.
*13:06.320- 13:08.780* :  A new way to reverse type two diabetes.
*13:18.320- 13:20.360* :  Well, we got a minute, and I'm going to buy that truck up in one.
*13:21.360- 13:23.820* :  Wait, don't you need like weeks to shop for a car?
*13:24.220- 13:24.740* :  I don't.
*13:24.820- 13:27.320* :  Carvana makes it super convenient to find exactly what I want.
*13:27.680- 13:28.160* :  Hold up.
*13:28.520- 13:30.000* :  You're buying a car on your phone?
*13:30.560- 13:31.820* :  Isn't that more of a laptop thing?
*13:32.020- 13:32.980* :  You can shop wherever you want.
*13:33.500- 13:36.160* :  I like to do my research, read reviews, compare models,
*13:36.160- 13:38.600* :  plus Carvana has thousands of options.
*13:38.600- 13:40.240* :  How'd you decide on that truck?
*13:40.700- 13:41.540* :  Because I like it.
*13:41.860- 13:43.460* :  No, that is a great reason.
*13:43.460- 13:46.620* :  Go to Carvana.com to sell your car the convenient way.

*14:33.240- 14:35.400* :  The Nobel Peace Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus,
*14:35.400- 14:38.620* :  has been named as the leader of an interim government in Bangladesh
*14:38.620- 14:42.140* :  a day after the former prime minister, Shaykhasina, was ousted.
*14:42.640- 14:45.320* :  His name was proposed by the leaders of the student movement
*14:45.320- 14:47.780* :  that led the nationwide anti-government protests.
*14:48.360- 14:49.920* :  Here's Anne Barrison-Ethirajan.
*14:50.380- 14:54.220* :  The announcement was made following talks between the Bangladeshi president,
*14:54.220- 14:56.840* :  Muhammad Shahabuddin and student leaders
*14:56.840- 15:01.440* :  who played a key role in the weeks of protests that toppled Shaykhasina.
*15:01.900- 15:06.700* :  Mr Yunus, who is 84, has faced numerous legal cases this year,
*15:07.060- 15:09.080* :  which he said were politically motivated.
*15:09.660- 15:13.500* :  Earlier, his office told the BBC that he had accepted the request
*15:13.500- 15:17.220* :  from the student leaders to be part of the interim administration.
*15:17.860- 15:22.100* :  The Bangladeshi capital Dhaka is now reported to be largely calm,
*15:22.500- 15:26.160* :  but there have been reports of looting and killing across the country.
*15:26.880- 15:30.200* :  As we said, as being reported that the former Bangladeshi prime minister,
*15:30.200- 15:33.420* :  Shaykhasina, after resigning, fled to neighboring India.
*15:34.020- 15:39.240* :  Bangladesh was born after a war in 1971 with Pakistan and was supported by India.
*15:39.860- 15:41.920* :  So, is there a political risk for India?
*15:41.920- 15:44.000* :  The longer Shaykhasina stays there.
*15:44.480- 15:48.980* :  Krupa Pat, he spoke to Riva Ganguly Das, India's former high commissioner to Bangladesh.
*15:49.540- 15:52.960* :  Given our proximity, given the largeness of our relationship,
*15:52.960- 15:55.120* :  given the intensity of our relationship,
*15:56.040- 16:01.440* :  it would not be in anybody's interest for her to have a prolonged stay in India.
*16:01.700- 16:04.460* :  As you've touched on there, the government of Mr Modi has
*16:04.460- 16:07.260* :  good ties with the government of Hasina Shayk.
*16:07.720- 16:13.020* :  I wonder how that might impact to rapport with any future government of Bangladesh.
*16:13.620- 16:18.480* :  I mean, we share a 4,000 plus kilometre border with Bangladesh with more than 30
*16:18.480- 16:22.820* :  check posts through which people and goods move on a daily basis.
*16:22.820- 16:28.980* :  There is intense movement of people, thousands from Bangladesh come to India for medical treatment.
*16:29.860- 16:32.220* :  Besides which, there is very intense trade.
*16:32.820- 16:35.100* :  So, we have to keep on doing business with Bangladesh.
*16:35.100- 16:39.220* :  It is true that, you know, Shaykhasina and Prime Minister Modi
*16:39.220- 16:44.860* :  demonstrated enormous political will and resolved some of the most outstanding issues
*16:45.640- 16:48.780* :  that have dog the relationship in the past.
*16:49.360- 16:53.820* :  But if you look at the history of, you know, in your Bangladesh relation, starting from
*16:54.520- 17:00.320* :  the liberation and then you had long years of military dictatorship, which were difficult
*17:00.320- 17:05.260* :  period for Indo-Mangalatish relation. So, the relationship has always survived no matter
*17:05.260- 17:10.920* :  who's in power and it has to survive for the people and the, you know, peace and prosperity
*17:10.920- 17:16.380* :  of the region. That said, we are in a politically uncertain time right now in Bangladesh.
*17:16.380- 17:21.580* :  And India borders Bangladesh as you pointed out to the west, to the north and to the east.
*17:22.160- 17:27.300* :  And I understand that India has stepped up border security. Are you therefore concerned
*17:27.300- 17:33.340* :  about refugees coming into India? Oh, certainly. I think that is a very big concern.
*17:33.340- 17:39.360* :  People who feel insecurity in their own country in Bangladesh might try to flee.
*17:39.360- 17:44.880* :  Because we've seen scenes of violence and anarchy which is absolutely unprecedented.
*17:44.880- 17:50.100* :  I mean, yesterday, the photographs which have come out of the videos which have come out of
*17:50.100- 17:52.500* :  Bangladesh are absolutely horrifying.
*17:53.460- 17:56.860* :  Riva Ganguly Das, India's former high commissioner to Bangladesh.
*17:58.240- 18:03.180* :  It's estimated that almost half a billion people around the world live with type two diabetes
*18:03.180- 18:07.200* :  and those numbers are on the rise. It's usually a lifelong condition.
*18:07.200- 18:10.760* :  Its ongoing treatment is a huge cost to governments everywhere.
*18:10.760- 18:15.600* :  In the UK, a new way has been found to reverse it as Alphabashon reports.
*18:16.060- 18:20.340* :  We live in a time where the market is flooded with ways to get us in better shape.
*18:20.340- 18:24.960* :  All of the greens into our diet that we need to have a healthy gut microbiome and a healthy body.
*18:25.640- 18:27.380* :  And with Hues daily greens product.
*18:29.380- 18:32.760* :  If eligible, you may pay as little as $25 per prescription.
*18:33.020- 18:36.400* :  Ask your healthcare provider today about once weekly ozambic.
*18:36.440- 18:38.140* :  And yet, it seems to be harder than ever.
*18:38.460- 18:44.660* :  Obesity has doubled since 1990 and half of the world's population is predicted to be overweight by 2035,
*18:45.320- 18:51.280* :  which can of course lead to type two diabetes, where the level of sugar in the blood becomes too high.
*18:51.840- 18:55.820* :  This makes it a very expensive disease, which needs daily medication for life,
*18:55.820- 19:00.540* :  and can lead to serious health consequences like heart disease, strokes or nerve damage.
*19:01.080- 19:05.660* :  Here in the UK, one in every £10 spent by the government on health goes to the
*19:05.660- 19:09.380* :  management of diabetes, but that may be about to change.
*19:09.780- 19:15.000* :  It takes people with fairly recently diagnosed type two diabetes and it puts them on to
*19:15.000- 19:19.440* :  an intensive lifestyle interventional programme, the first three months of which
*19:20.060- 19:22.200* :  are what we call total diet replacements.
*19:22.480- 19:26.020* :  That's Professor Jonathan Velabji of the State Funded National Health Service,
*19:26.020- 19:29.520* :  proposing a new liquid diet of soups and shakes.
*19:29.520- 19:34.600* :  It allows people or supports people to lose considerable amounts of weight.
*19:34.700- 19:38.020* :  So at the end of the 12 months, the average weight loss is 10 kilograms.
*19:38.020- 19:39.260* :  That's the stone in a half.
*19:40.020- 19:45.360* :  Now that is sufficient weight loss to permit around a third of participants to actually put the
*19:45.360- 19:47.160* :  type two diabetes into remission.
*19:47.400- 19:51.720* :  And what that means is that people can return to normal blood sugar levels without the need for
*19:51.720- 19:56.540* :  medication. The other piece of good news is that the regime only needs to be kept up for three
*19:56.540- 20:01.080* :  months. The bad news is that it's a measly 900 calories a day.
*20:01.540- 20:07.120* :  It was very difficult to start with, but the more you went on in with the encouragement
*20:07.120- 20:13.840* :  with the team that supported you and everything, it was brilliant because I lost three stone in the end.
*20:14.260- 20:19.380* :  It's completely remission. I haven't been on any medication now for about a year and a half.
*20:19.780- 20:23.660* :  And she was one of the more determined ones, the scientists submit that of the many
*20:23.660- 20:27.060* :  thousands that were invited only hundreds made it to the end.
*20:27.400- 20:32.160* :  But it does mean those with diabetes who want to avoid medication will now have a choice.
*20:32.580- 20:36.380* :  And given the cost it can save in the long run, it will be offered to people in the UK,
*20:36.380- 20:41.880* :  completely free of charge. Tuesday was day 11 of the Paris Olympic Games,
*20:41.880- 20:46.220* :  and our reporter Paul Serra's told me about an exciting 1,500 metres.
*20:46.640- 20:52.520* :  An incredible night of drama at the Stade de France, Andrew, the upset of the night,
*20:52.520- 20:58.100* :  and maybe of the athletics programme at the games saw the battle, the much hyped battle between
*20:58.100- 21:03.640* :  Great Britain's Josh Kerr and the Norwegian Jacob Inga Britson, won by neither. Gold went to
*21:03.640- 21:08.200* :  Cole Hocker in the men's 1,500 metres. There was more success on the track for the US,
*21:08.200- 21:11.900* :  with gold for Gabby Thomas in the women's 200 metres.
*21:12.380- 21:17.400* :  Winfred Yavi won the women's steeple chase. The Canadian Cameron Rogers won Olympic gold to add
*21:17.400- 21:20.200* :  to the World Championship gold, she won last year in the women's hammer.
*21:20.660- 21:25.780* :  And Militiaid is 10 told who of Greece retained his men's long jump gold medal from the Tokyo Games.
*21:25.980- 21:30.540* :  Now, it's been some controversy around the boxing poor with two athletes who are disqualified
*21:30.540- 21:35.140* :  from the World Boxing Championships in New Delhi, performing pretty well, in fact, one getting
*21:35.140- 21:39.160* :  to the gold medal match. That's right, yeah. One of those boxes you mentioned, Andrew,
*21:39.160- 21:44.640* :  Emanke Leif of Algeria, won her semi-final against Jan Jamsu, one thing of Thailand,
*21:44.640- 21:47.480* :  earlier on day 11, and will now fight for gold.
*21:47.480- 21:53.220* :  Khalif and Taiwan's lin new team were disqualified from last year's championships over questions
*21:53.220- 21:58.280* :  about their gender eligibility. Finally, an Olympic first on day 11, what happened?
*21:58.980- 22:04.500* :  Yeah, the legendary Cuban wrestler, Mikhail Lopez won a fifth consecutive gold medal
*22:04.500- 22:09.740* :  in the heaviest Greek-oh-Roman weight division. That's the first time it's ever happened in the Olympics.
*22:10.200- 22:15.020* :  Our sports reporter, Paul Sarah's. 50 years ago, the French high-wire artist,
*22:15.020- 22:20.040* :  Philippe Petit, walked across a cable that had been strung illegally between the twin towers
*22:20.040- 22:24.820* :  of the World Trade Center in New York. Early in the morning, he crossed between the towers
*22:24.820- 22:30.400* :  eight times a quarter of a mile or more than 400 meters above the ground. At one point,
*22:30.400- 22:35.540* :  he laid down on the cable, even danced on it. And when Philippe Petit finally reached the ground,
*22:35.540- 22:42.160* :  he was arrested by angry police officers. A documentary film, Manon Wai, was released in 2008.
*22:43.140- 22:44.800* :  The basic plan was very simple.
*22:46.980- 22:53.400* :  I know there was going to be a team in each tower. We had ID cards. Fear was in the air.
*22:54.240- 22:58.860* :  I assumed that we were all going to be arrested. If I die, what a beautiful death.
*22:59.720- 23:04.440* :  Everybody was felled down in the watching of it. Figured I was watching something that
*23:04.440- 23:09.660* :  somebody else would never see again in the world. This week, Philippe Petit, who's 74,
*23:09.660- 23:14.900* :  marked the anniversary with a more sedentary high-wire crossing from one side of the nave to the
*23:14.900- 23:20.260* :  other of the Cathedral Church of St John the Divine in New York. Julian Marshall spoke to him
*23:20.520- 23:23.620* :  and asked what he remembered about the twin towers high-wire crossing.
*23:24.160- 23:33.020* :  I remember everything as if it were yesterday. The height was terrifying, but I had preparation
*23:33.040- 23:40.700* :  for that. I had been working on different high wires, not as high. And I was not afraid because
*23:40.700- 23:48.300* :  I was so excited. I had planned this adventure for months and months and months. So I was more
*23:48.460- 23:56.040* :  joyful and impatient than I was afraid. You said you'd prepared it for months. I mean,
*23:56.040- 24:02.980* :  what you were doing was illegal. So that must have involved quite a lot of subterfuge.
*24:03.840- 24:12.280* :  Yes, I sometimes related to a bank robbery, a call it a coup. I had to learn about the twin
*24:12.280- 24:19.780* :  towers. I had to learn about the security in the twin towers. I had to find an engineering way
*24:20.220- 24:27.440* :  to pass an anchor my cable. And that took months and months. And then the rest is history or
*24:27.440- 24:34.400* :  legend, as they say. And all the time you were playing cat and mouse with the New York police.
*24:34.860- 24:42.140* :  When I came to New York to prepare for the twin towers coup, I literally spent four months,
*24:42.140- 24:50.320* :  almost every day, disguising myself like a construction worker or an architect or a journalist.
*24:50.320- 24:56.520* :  And I went to the top and I took pictures and I measured and I interviewed the workers.
*24:57.140- 25:04.380* :  So all that was what I call my spy work. How did you actually attach the high wire to both towers?
*25:05.000- 25:11.880* :  So I had to first create a link between the two towers. And that was done by my friend Jean-Louis
*25:12.140- 25:18.120* :  who shot an arrow with a bow from the north to the south tower. And then we passed
*25:18.340- 25:26.300* :  heavier and heavier cords and ropes until we could pull directly the heavy steel cable.
*25:31.280- 25:34.480* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News later.
