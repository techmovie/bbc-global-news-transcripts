*00:59.360- 01:03.740* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Friday the 9th of August.
*01:03.740- 01:09.000* :  Donald Trump does a U-turn and agrees to debate Kamala Harris on the 10th of September.
*01:09.560- 01:14.000* :  Mohammed Yunus has been sworn in as head of an interim government in Bangladesh days after the
*01:14.000- 01:19.780* :  authoritarian prime minister was ousted and Ukraine's president as Russia is feeling the consequences
*01:19.780- 01:25.400* :  of bringing war to his country. Also in the podcast,
*01:26.300- 01:31.240* :  using the drones enabled us to get to close forest areas that we wouldn't be able to get to
*01:31.240- 01:36.560* :  on the ground and we can see super high resolution imagery and we can start looking at real detail
*01:36.560- 01:41.840* :  at mapping what's going on. How drones could help save the forests of Madagascar.
*01:47.040- 01:51.980* :  Is Donald Trump starting to worry that the battle for the White House will be tougher than expected?
*01:52.320- 01:54.760* :  Since Kamala Harris became the Democratic candidate,
*01:54.760- 01:57.760* :  momentum has swung away from the Republican hopeful.
*01:57.760- 02:01.860* :  A recent Ipsos poll put in five points behind the Vice President.
*02:01.900- 02:06.580* :  In order to try to regain the initiative, the former president has given a news conference
*02:06.580- 02:11.740* :  in his Florida resort and despite previously backing out of a planned presidential TV debate
*02:11.740- 02:18.340* :  hosted by ABC News, Mr. Trump has now agreed to do it and offered two more dates as well.
*02:18.840- 02:21.720* :  And he suggested his opponent would struggle to debate him.
*02:22.220- 02:26.000* :  The other side has to agree to the terms they may or may not agree.
*02:26.000- 02:28.640* :  I don't know if they're going to agree that she hasn't done an interview.
*02:29.240- 02:33.280* :  She can't do an interview. She's barely competent and she can't do an interview.
*02:33.960- 02:37.700* :  But I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.
*02:38.260- 02:41.940* :  I asked our North America correspondent David Willis what he made of it all.
*02:42.500- 02:45.740* :  Well, this was the first press conference of course that Donald Trump has held
*02:45.740- 02:51.040* :  all of a since Joe Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the election campaign
*02:51.180- 02:54.000* :  and just a few weeks ago and it was pretty classic.
*02:54.700- 02:58.640* :  Donald Trump wasn't attacking his new opponent, Kamala Harris,
*02:59.040- 03:04.640* :  making some dubious perhaps outrightly false claims about the size of crowds
*03:05.560- 03:10.420* :  at her rallies compared to his and about the state of the American economy.
*03:10.420- 03:16.680* :  The main news line as you identified was this announcement only days after he said he was pulling
*03:16.680- 03:22.880* :  out of a scheduled debate with Kamala Harris next month that he proposed three debates with three
*03:22.880- 03:28.840* :  separate networks that very say month and the US network ABC has in fact since confirmed
*03:29.700- 03:35.060* :  that the two candidates have agreed to hold a debate on the 10th of September in just over a
*03:35.060- 03:41.180* :  month's time. And I think that Donald Trump sees a televised debate as a possible means of
*03:41.180- 03:48.700* :  regaining some of the momentum perhaps that his campaign has lost since Kamala Harris was thrust
*03:48.700- 03:54.200* :  into the spotlight just a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, does that you turn over the ABC debate suggest
*03:54.200- 03:58.420* :  that Trump campaign is rattled by the current polls? Well, it's interesting. I mean,
*03:58.420- 04:04.600* :  Donald Trump was asked in this press conference if he had adapted his campaign style in
*04:04.600- 04:10.080* :  recognition of the fact that he's now facing a very different kind of opponent in Kamala Harris
*04:10.080- 04:17.300* :  and he denied that that was happening. He did acknowledge however some changing patterns among them
*04:17.440- 04:23.840* :  the fact that he said he might not be as popular as he once was with black female voters. That's
*04:23.840- 04:30.600* :  one of the Republicans' key voting blocks traditionally, of course. Now officials with the Trump
*04:30.600- 04:36.980* :  campaign are saying that they believe that a Kamala Harris honeymoon period will wear off.
*04:36.980- 04:45.960* :  But you know, we heard evidence that Mr. Trump is rattled by the current level of support that
*04:45.960- 04:53.880* :  Kamala Harris is generating and he went back to those old claims about the size of attendance
*04:54.000- 05:00.180* :  at his rallies compared to the attendance at hers. Of course, we know from the past,
*05:00.180- 05:05.580* :  don't we, that size does matter to Donald Trump just after he was inaugurated. He sent his
*05:05.580- 05:11.020* :  press spokesman Sean Spicer out to declare that the crowd for that event was the biggest of
*05:11.020- 05:17.440* :  its kind ever. Well, today he told reporters the attendance at his rally on the 6th of January 2021
*05:18.280- 05:26.200* :  was bigger than that at the famous March on Washington back in 1963 that was led by Dr. Martin
*05:26.200- 05:33.520* :  Luther King. Quite a claim that David Willister. Three days after shake Hacena was overthrown as
*05:33.520- 05:45.500* :  Prime Minister of Bangladesh, a new leader has been sworn in. The 84-year-old economist,
*05:45.500- 05:51.240* :  Mohammed Yunus, was chosen to run the interim government by the protest leaders. He won the Nobel
*05:51.240- 05:57.320* :  Peace Prize in 2006 for helping lift millions from poverty through microfinance, providing small
*05:57.320- 06:02.880* :  loans to those two poor to access traditional banks. But he clashed with Bangladesh's long-term
*06:02.880- 06:09.020* :  ruler, shake Hacena, and she accused him of sucking blood from the poor. Mary Howton, who worked
*06:09.020- 06:15.740* :  with him, has a different view. What you see is that he's very charming, he's highly intelligent,
*06:15.740- 06:24.600* :  he's quite charismatic. He listens closely, he's completely passionate about the work of his bank,
*06:24.600- 06:32.220* :  which is essentially to deliver small loans to rural people, mainly women. So you just see him as
*06:32.220- 06:38.780* :  an entrepreneur who's resourceful, a good manager, and has a very strong leadership ability. Not only
*06:38.780- 06:45.700* :  with his own employees and customers, but I think he's been a good leader in his relationships with
*06:45.700- 06:52.960* :  people all around the world who've been interested in the bank. Years later, he remembered verbatim,
*06:53.160- 06:58.400* :  what people said to him about what they would need in Arkansas if they were to get a small loan.
*06:58.980- 07:03.640* :  Mohammed Yunus left Bangladesh earlier this year after being sentenced to what he said was a
*07:03.640- 07:09.500* :  politically motivated jail term. He arrived back on Thursday afternoon, saying Bangladesh was
*07:09.500- 07:15.020* :  celebrating a second independence. Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein caught up with him at
*07:15.020- 07:21.800* :  the airport. How did you feel? I feel good and back. A lot of work to be done. People are excited,
*07:21.980- 07:30.040* :  know that something new opportunities have arrived. What is your message for people here? Discipline,
*07:30.040- 07:36.180* :  discipline, hard work, and get it done. Mohammed Yunus, I heard more about the immediate challenges
*07:36.180- 07:42.880* :  facing him from our correspondent in Dhaka Akbar Hussein. First of all, he has to ensure the safety
*07:42.880- 07:48.540* :  and security of the people which he promised. Because in many parts of the country we have seen
*07:49.260- 07:55.760* :  violence is going on. Many people are targeted, their houses are vandalized, their properties,
*07:56.300- 08:01.740* :  business, or a claim under attack. The second thing is the politics in Bangladesh because this is
*08:01.740- 08:07.300* :  very complex. Professor Yunus is not a politician. He will have to deal with politics.
*08:07.980- 08:13.740* :  Shekhasina ruled the country for the last 15 years. She built up a very strong army,
*08:13.740- 08:20.260* :  police, and civil administration. Many people loyal to her still serving in the administration.
*08:20.940- 08:26.780* :  So, Professor Yunus will have to deal with those people. Third and last but not the least,
*08:26.780- 08:33.260* :  it is the economy of Bangladesh because all indicators in the economy is very bad.
*08:34.040- 08:41.040* :  Foreign debt is very high. Inflation is extremely high. So, Professor Yunus will have to deal
*08:41.420- 08:46.440* :  with the economy as well. So, it's a long list and I think it won't be a very easy journey
*08:46.440- 08:52.160* :  for him to fix everything. What might he do in terms of practical measures in the next few days?
*08:53.060- 08:56.680* :  The first thing is to establish the bring back normalcy in the country.
*08:57.480- 09:02.380* :  And second thing, you know, he will have to assure that these companies capable of
*09:02.680- 09:06.280* :  delivering their aspirations. So, that is the most important thing.
*09:07.060- 09:10.160* :  The security forces will they be loyal to Mohamed Yus?
*09:10.720- 09:16.200* :  That's a big question. We have seen today all the chiefs of the security forces in Bangladesh.
*09:16.880- 09:23.260* :  They have decided to take very tough action against the criminals. They said that the way
*09:23.720- 09:30.260* :  disorder is going on, this is unacceptable. Around 500 police stations were set on fire during
*09:30.260- 09:36.380* :  violence and many police officers, they weren't under hiding because they are scared of public
*09:36.380- 09:43.680* :  backlash. So, now there is no police in any police stations. Students are directing traffic in
*09:43.680- 09:48.000* :  Dhaka and elsewhere in the country because there is no traffic police on the streets.
*09:48.520- 09:52.320* :  So, Professor Mohamed Yus? will have to restructure the whole force
*09:52.820- 09:55.520* :  so that the safety and security can be established.
*09:55.960- 09:58.480* :  Akbar has seen in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka.
*09:59.280- 10:03.800* :  In our earlier podcast, we heard that police in Austria had arrested two teenagers accused
*10:03.800- 10:09.580* :  of planning an attack on Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. The authorities there have now revealed
*10:09.580- 10:14.060* :  details of the alleged plot, which prompted the cancellation of the three shows.
*10:14.380- 10:17.220* :  I heard more from our security correspondent Gordon Carrera.
*10:17.940- 10:23.740* :  It does sound like a significant plot, which was apparently disrupted, really quite close to it,
*10:23.760- 10:30.680* :  potentially being carried out. A 19-year-old who was said to be planning an attack outside the venue
*10:30.680- 10:36.500* :  where the concert was taking place, possibly ramming with a car, possibly using knives or other
*10:36.500- 10:41.820* :  weapons, but also potentially explosives and some devices and chemicals seem to have been found
*10:41.820- 10:47.620* :  at a search of his house. Also, another individual, another teenager also arrested a
*10:47.620- 10:53.040* :  alleged to be an accomplice who had got a job working at events management at the site itself.
*10:53.680- 10:58.120* :  And I think that's all a sign that this is potentially quite serious. How far it was directed
*10:58.120- 11:03.600* :  by another group? That's less clear, but the 19-year-old is said to have sworn a note of allegiance
*11:03.600- 11:08.300* :  to the group calling itself Islamic State and potentially to have been radicalised online.
*11:08.380- 11:13.520* :  So we don't know if they were formally part of a group, but they were certainly influenced.
*11:13.600- 11:18.220* :  I think that's what it looks like at the moment that there was influence and radicalisation,
*11:18.220- 11:23.460* :  but not necessarily a directed or trained attack, but that's what it looks like so far.
*11:23.680- 11:27.820* :  And are they still looking for other people? The authorities have indicated that they're not,
*11:27.820- 11:31.420* :  there was some talk that there might be a couple of other people they were looking for, but they've
*11:31.420- 11:37.860* :  played that down, and they've suggested that the concrete threat to the concerts has gone away
*11:37.860- 11:42.740* :  as a result of their arrest, although that obviously hasn't stopped the promoters cancelling them.
*11:42.880- 11:46.700* :  Left a lot of people disappointed, obviously. Yeah, and some of those disappointed fans have
*11:46.700- 11:52.280* :  been joining forces, singing Taylor Swift songs, getting together. Are they at risk there? Well,
*11:52.280- 11:57.440* :  the authorities have suggested that they've disrupted this plot, so I don't think they will feel
*11:57.440- 12:01.480* :  that there's any greater risk than there was before. I think it is interesting that the plot
*12:01.480- 12:06.360* :  perhaps was outside the venue where people do gather often and where there might be less security
*12:06.360- 12:10.840* :  than inside a venue. So that was the original concern, but that doesn't necessarily mean
*12:10.840- 12:14.980* :  it's continued beyond what you'd normally expect, given that there have been arrests.
*12:15.320- 12:19.040* :  And the significance of targeting a Taylor Swift concert just because it's a big event or
*12:19.040- 12:23.220* :  specifically heard, do you think? I mean, she's the biggest superstar there is, so I think if you
*12:23.220- 12:28.160* :  want the maximum publicity, which is often what these groups or individuals want, then nothing
*12:28.160- 12:33.040* :  probably could be bigger than targeting a Taylor Swift concert. So I think beyond killing people
*12:33.080- 12:37.940* :  or doing that kind of damage, it is about the publicity for such groups. And I think that's
*12:38.400- 12:42.800* :  likely why it was and maybe perhaps a symbol of the United States as well. Now, after these
*12:42.800- 12:48.680* :  cancelled shows in Austria, Taylor Swift is supposed to be heading here to London to play at
*12:48.700- 12:53.240* :  Wembley. Do you think that will go ahead of their threats there? Well, the metropolitan police
*12:53.240- 12:58.400* :  have suggested that what's happened in Austria has no direct bearing on the UK, suggesting they
*12:58.400- 13:02.640* :  don't have any intelligence or information about any specific threats. And the mayor of London
*13:02.640- 13:07.380* :  has also said that he will be working with the police and other authorities to make sure the
*13:07.380- 13:12.820* :  concerts do take place. Ah, security correspondent Gordon Carrera. Three days into a reported
*13:12.820- 13:17.920* :  Ukrainian cross-border incursion into Russia, President Putin's forces have still not been
*13:17.920- 13:23.820* :  able to dislodge the attackers. Ukraine hasn't acknowledged carrying out the daring assault on
*13:23.820- 13:28.800* :  the Kursk region. But in his nightly address, President Zelensky told the Ukrainian people,
*13:28.800- 13:34.120* :  Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it's done. In Russia itself,
*13:34.120- 13:37.640* :  there is shock and anger as Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
*13:38.440- 13:43.180* :  This week, lots of dramatic images have come out of Russia. From Kursk region,
*13:43.180- 13:49.660* :  phone footage of low-flying fighter jets, bombed out streets, Russian soldiers surrendering
*13:49.660- 13:56.400* :  in Russia. But for me, it was a video of Vladimir Putin more than anything, which spoke volumes
*13:56.400- 14:05.000* :  about what is happening right now. When the chief of the general staff told President Putin
*14:05.000- 14:11.660* :  that up to 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers had attacked and crossed into Russia, the Kremlin leader looked
*14:11.660- 14:18.660* :  live it, as if he was restraining himself from shouting. For Moscow, this is a huge embarrassment.
*14:18.660- 14:23.600* :  The cross-border attack took the country's political and military leadership by surprise.
*14:24.620- 14:29.860* :  Today, Russia's hawkish former President Dmitry Medvedev called on Moscow to respond
*14:29.860- 14:37.600* :  by seizing more Ukrainian land up to Kiev and beyond. And yet, after three days of fierce fighting,
*14:38.220- 14:43.660* :  Russia has been unable to restore control over its own territory in Kursk region.
*14:44.420- 14:49.120* :  The authorities will almost certainly try to use what is happening to rally the Russian
*14:49.120- 14:55.920* :  public around the flag, and to bolster the Kremlin's full narrative. That Russia is not the
*14:55.920- 15:02.780* :  aggressor in this war. In reality, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. Our Russia editor,
*15:02.780- 15:08.580* :  Steve Rosenberg, in Moscow. The Indian wrestler, Vinay Fogart, has announced her retirement,
*15:08.580- 15:14.080* :  a day after she was disqualified from her Olympic final for being 100 grams overweight.
*15:14.220- 15:19.720* :  The 29-year-old, who is well-known in India for campaigning against sexist attitudes in women's
*15:19.720- 15:24.740* :  wrestling, even cut her hair to try to make the weight for the gold medal bout against American
*15:24.740- 15:29.300* :  Sarah Hildebrandt. Here's our South Asia regional editor and barsan at Irraja.
*15:30.080- 15:36.460* :  Vinay Fogart is one of India's most decorated wrestlers, and only an Olympic medal was missing
*15:36.460- 15:42.460* :  from her collection. She was just one fight away from becoming the first women from India to win
*15:42.460- 15:49.800* :  gold in any Olympic sport, but she was disqualified before her final match for being overweight in
*15:49.800- 15:56.320* :  the 50 kilogram category, not much roughly the weight of a small banana. Fogart had reportedly
*15:56.320- 16:02.360* :  starved herself for a week, spent hours in the sauna and cut her hair to lose weight for the
*16:02.360- 16:09.400* :  contest. Her disqualification broke a billion hearts in India and triggered a near meltdown on social
*16:09.400- 16:13.600* :  media. The whole of the Indian people are very angry. They are very sad. The whole of the
*16:13.600- 16:19.160* :  India was looking for a gold from her and it was a disaster for Indian wrestling for Indian sports.
*16:19.160- 16:25.800* :  Just 100 grams, 100 grams is nothing. Fogart is known at home for spearheading a protest last year
*16:26.260- 16:31.360* :  against alleged sexual harassment of young female wrestlers by the federation chief,
*16:31.360- 16:37.620* :  Bridge Bush and Singh, a charge in denies. It was called the Me Too moment in Indian sports.
*16:37.660- 16:44.120* :  Announcing a retirement from the sport on social media, Fogart said she no longer had the strength
*16:44.120- 16:49.840* :  to carry on. Wrestling won, and I lost, she wrote. My dreams are shattered.
*16:54.740- 17:00.060* :  And still to come on the global news podcast, the eight day trip into space that could end up
*17:00.060- 17:01.380* :  lasting eight months.
*17:40.380- 17:45.440* :  Did you know that it's 50 years this week since Richard Nixon became the first US president in
*17:45.440- 17:50.920* :  history to resign from office. To mark this monumental moment, witness history brings you five
*17:50.920- 17:56.640* :  programs about influential events in US presidential history. And with all the amazing twists and
*17:56.640- 18:01.460* :  turns in the current race for the White House, what a time to bring you them. You'll hear about
*18:01.460- 18:06.560* :  the closest US election in history and from the man who was in the situation room during the
*18:06.560- 18:11.660* :  raid on a summer bin Laden. That's witness history from the BBC World Service. Listen and

*18:26.220- 18:32.780* :  An estimated 2,000 people have been detained. The opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado,
*18:32.780- 18:37.480* :  has denounced the official result as fraudulent and called for mass demonstrations.
*18:37.480- 18:42.920* :  The protests have been met by a severe crackdown, and the security forces have more people
*18:42.920- 18:48.440* :  in their sights. Hazel Saramasa, campaign manager for the opposition coalition in Caracas state,
*18:48.440- 18:51.720* :  is currently in hiding. He spoke to James Menendez.
*18:52.340- 18:59.460* :  Right now, hundreds of activists in Venezuela are in hiding because the repression is brutal.
*19:00.180- 19:07.060* :  For example, two days ago, one of the members of Maria Corina's team was kidnapped by some
*19:07.060- 19:16.700* :  member of the special police of Nicolás Maduro. And she record everything in Instagram,
*19:16.700- 19:24.900* :  so that was really brutal for us to watch. And it's higher because I fear that maybe the
*19:24.900- 19:31.180* :  Nicolás Maduro special police is coming from me. I can be jailed just because I'm part of the
*19:31.180- 19:33.660* :  Maria Corina Machado and it won't be more sadistic.
*19:34.080- 19:40.240* :  And your colleague who you spoke about who was taken by the police, do you know where she is now,
*19:40.240- 19:42.540* :  where she's been held, what will happen to her?
*19:43.000- 19:49.040* :  No, that's the main thing about this. It's not only that they are taken without any legal order.
*19:50.460- 19:53.780* :  They are kidnapped and nobody knows where they are.
*19:54.280- 19:55.200* :  Do you feel fear?
*19:55.560- 20:02.380* :  Yes, of course. All Venezuelans that want a different country feel fear right now, but at the same
*20:02.380- 20:09.840* :  time, we feel hope because we want the elections, we have the proof, and we want to fight peacefully,
*20:09.840- 20:12.520* :  of course, to bring back democracy to our country.
*20:12.760- 20:19.400* :  And that presumably is the tactic of the government to make opposition activists like yourself fearful
*20:19.400- 20:23.740* :  so that you don't go out onto the street. And that way, they will win, weren't they?
*20:24.020- 20:30.340* :  Yes, of course. And it's not only about activists. We have 2,000 people taken, and they're not
*20:30.340- 20:37.540* :  only activists. There are also normal citizens that want to street in peaceful ways, but at the same
*20:37.540- 20:40.680* :  time, we are going to keep the fight going on.
*20:40.960- 20:46.280* :  But how are you going to do that, if, like yourself, you're hiding out somewhere? What is the
*20:46.280- 20:48.720* :  tactic for the opposition to contest the result?
*20:49.040- 20:54.820* :  In one hand, the Chilean government, Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian government,
*20:54.820- 21:00.800* :  and trying to explore a diplomatic way. In the other hand, we are still organizing
*21:00.860- 21:07.960* :  citizens every day, and I think we can keep protests in the streets, but in a very strategic
*21:08.000- 21:12.360* :  peaceful way, eventually, we will win.
*21:12.640- 21:19.260* :  How confident are you that, for example, Brazil and Mexico will continue to press the government?
*21:19.480- 21:24.680* :  They've said, for example, that the Supreme Court should decide that it should be the
*21:24.680- 21:29.260* :  judicial system that resolves this dispute over the election. But you as the opposition,
*21:29.320- 21:31.880* :  you don't have any confidence in the Supreme Court, do you?
*21:32.420- 21:39.880* :  No, everything is controlled by Nicolas Mauro. But I think that this diplomatic effort of
*21:39.880- 21:47.500* :  Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia are important because they can show the international left and
*21:47.500- 21:55.360* :  center left parties that Nicolas Mauro is lying. We want to show the war that Nicolas Mauro is
*21:55.360- 22:03.440* :  dictator. Hezal Sarma is talking to James Menendez. As many as 90% of the plants and animal species
*22:03.440- 22:08.420* :  on Madagascar are unique to the island, which sits in the Indian Ocean about 400 kilometres
*22:08.420- 22:14.340* :  east of the African continent. But despite its unique ecosystem, Madagascar's precious rainforest
*22:14.380- 22:19.720* :  has for decades been destroyed by illegal logging and the burning of timber for charcoal.
*22:20.220- 22:24.420* :  Now a team from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Q in London is using drone footage
*22:24.420- 22:29.740* :  to map the forests and try to find ways to restore it. Jenny Williams is a senior analyst,
*22:29.740- 22:35.220* :  that cue. Part of the problem in Madagascar is, well, it's a fourth, the fourth island in the world,
*22:35.220- 22:40.260* :  so it's massive. It's the poorest non-war-torn country in the world, so there's very limited
*22:40.260- 22:46.560* :  resources for a lot of things. 50% of the forests have been lost since the 50s. So there's massive
*22:46.560- 22:51.580* :  losses. It's a big place. What can we do to have a look at the forests that survive? So looking
*22:51.580- 22:56.840* :  at satellite imagery, we can have a look at where the forest patch is seem to be, but my interest
*22:56.840- 23:01.360* :  was running that a little bit smaller. So we can see that there are big losses due to deforestation
*23:01.420- 23:06.140* :  and fires and things like that. But what's the value of the forest that we still have? We know that
*23:06.140- 23:10.900* :  carbon gets locked up in forests, and that's our big resource and a big storage of carbon and
*23:10.900- 23:14.580* :  helping mitigate climate change and things like that. So what are the state of the forest that
*23:14.580- 23:20.680* :  currently there at the moment? And using the drones and able us to get to close forest areas that
*23:20.680- 23:25.420* :  we wouldn't be able to get to on the ground, we can see super high resolution imagery, which is
*23:25.520- 23:30.900* :  absolutely stunning. And then on top of that, we can really start drilling down to having a look at
*23:30.900- 23:34.240* :  areas that we wouldn't be able to see with satellite imagery because it's on the cloud cover,
*23:34.240- 23:39.120* :  we can fly them when we want if there's a seasonality in the trees, and we can start looking at real
*23:39.120- 23:44.600* :  detail at mapping what's going on. There's massive holes in the forest that you wouldn't be able to
*23:44.600- 23:49.000* :  see. So in the front, you look like an intact clear forest, and then you fly the drone over and you
*23:49.000- 23:53.580* :  show the local communities, it looks like a Swiss cheese. Jenny Williams, a senior analyst at Q
*23:53.580- 23:59.860* :  Gardens. Australia's national airline quantus has taken a hit to its reputation in recent years,
*24:00.480- 24:05.600* :  and as a result, it's now trying to claw back nearly $6 million from its format chief executive,
*24:05.600- 24:11.660* :  Alan Joyce. James Thompson from the Australian Financial Review in Melbourne told Will Bane more
*24:11.660- 24:18.200* :  about the story. This is quite an unprecedented move. Joyce left the airline and in about September
*24:18.200- 24:25.400* :  last year after it hit some reputational crises around a series of things. Really, it's treatment
*24:25.400- 24:30.580* :  of customers in the wake of the pandemic, it's a relationship with the Australian federal government,
*24:30.580- 24:37.240* :  and I guess the record profit that it delivered last year, which was sort of seen to come at the
*24:37.240- 24:44.160* :  expense of staff and customers. Yeah, long running row with passengers over refunds, as you say,
*24:44.160- 24:49.660* :  but also a long running row with its own staff too. Yeah, that's right. During the pandemic,
*24:49.660- 24:56.560* :  in a move to cut costs, it sacked a bunch of baggage handlers and ground crew who went to the
*24:56.560- 25:03.180* :  federal court in Australia to protest or to sue the company for that move. And one, they won in
*25:03.180- 25:07.760* :  several courts, quantus fought them all the way through the Australian legal system, but was found
*25:07.760- 25:12.520* :  to have sacked those workers illegally. So there's been this wrong running stash between
*25:12.520- 25:18.620* :  quantus and its staff, which is added to, I guess, the heightened tensions around this company.
*25:18.860- 25:24.280* :  Plenty of reasons, I guess, NPR reasons amongst them to make the move you were outlining. But
*25:24.280- 25:28.340* :  contractually, I mean, is that it is it all clear cut? Is this done or are we about to have a
*25:28.340- 25:34.480* :  legal battle over this cash? No, you're right. It is not clear cut. The board has taken what I think
*25:34.480- 25:40.800* :  is a calculated gamble here that Alan Joyce won't want to sort of continue to fight this, what
*25:40.800- 25:47.360* :  is to get to court, but you're right. Joyce had earned these bonuses under the terms of his contract
*25:47.360- 25:53.200* :  and under the remuneration, the pay framework that quantus had set out. So it is an interesting
*25:53.200- 25:58.940* :  question. Will Joyce and other executives look to challenge? I'm not sure. That could set up a
*25:58.940- 26:04.980* :  sticky legal fight for both them and the company, but the company has taken a bit of a risk here.
*26:05.140- 26:09.960* :  And if that becomes the case, it becomes yet another headache for an airline that's got plenty
*26:09.960- 26:13.620* :  of them right now. I mean, operationally, we know performance you won't know better than anybody.
*26:13.620- 26:18.460* :  I'm sure James. Performance has been an issue too for this company away from any scandal.
*26:19.440- 26:25.020* :  It has. I mean, they suffered like all airlines during the pandemic from sort of poor on time
*26:25.020- 26:30.460* :  performance, lots of cancellations, lots of supply chain issues. They have come out of that fairly
*26:30.460- 26:36.100* :  well in the last six to 12 months. So they have turned around more planes flying in the air.
*26:36.100- 26:40.900* :  They've put a bit more redundancy in their network. They're generally doing a better job for
*26:40.900- 26:46.540* :  customers. So that started to have an effect. And I think it's really calmed down the
*26:46.540- 26:52.720* :  really inflamed tensions with the Australian public last year. But yeah, they do have a way to go
*26:52.720- 26:58.080* :  to restoring their brand. And I'm sure the last thing they want is to be fighting their executives
*26:58.080- 27:02.560* :  in court. But I think they're betting that the last thing that those executives want to do
*27:02.940- 27:07.780* :  is to prolong the agony as well. James Thompson from the Australian financial review.
*27:08.740- 27:13.760* :  It was supposed to be an eight day trip into space for two American astronauts. They were
*27:13.760- 27:18.420* :  delighted when they arrived at the International Space Station. I'm not sure we could have gotten
*27:18.420- 27:24.120* :  a better welcome. It was great. It was such a great welcome, little dance party. And that's the
*27:24.120- 27:29.460* :  way to get things going. And we're just we're just happy as can be to be up in space.
*27:30.020- 27:34.040* :  So I got off to a good start, but then NASA detected a problem with their Boeing
*27:34.040- 27:39.940* :  Starliner spacecraft. And more than eight weeks on, they are still stuck up there with no sign
*27:39.940- 27:45.120* :  they could be coming home any time soon. In fact, NASA is now considering leaving them there
*27:45.120- 27:49.860* :  until February next year, when they could join the return leg of a future mission.
*27:49.860- 27:55.900* :  Helen Sharman was the first British astronaut. Nule McGovernaster, if this enforced stay,
*27:55.900- 28:01.280* :  was an occupational hazard. I don't think they'll be freaking out, but yes, occupational hazard
*28:01.940- 28:06.600* :  absolutely. They've trained for all sorts of missions and being a flight test, this is always
*28:06.600- 28:12.640* :  going to be a particularly risky mission. However, you don't really expect eight days to turn
*28:12.640- 28:17.020* :  into, you know, eight months or so. And of course, it's the other ramifications, not just for
*28:17.020- 28:22.500* :  this particular, the two people whose mission is extended a lot potentially a long time.
*28:22.500- 28:28.260* :  We still think they may come back on Starliner, actually, but still it's looking less likely.
*28:28.580- 28:32.860* :  But the other crew that's on board the space station with them, they were expecting to return
*28:32.860- 28:38.580* :  to Earth at the end of August time. That's now going to be put back by probably five or six weeks
*28:38.580- 28:43.780* :  or so in order to accommodate the movings around the term that NASA's having to think about.
*28:44.100- 28:48.740* :  So yeah, so it's not just these two. Everybody's, well, they're four at least, they're also now
*28:48.740- 28:52.100* :  thinking about them. Now, they're going to have to tell their family, oh, you know what,
*28:52.200- 28:55.140* :  I'm going to miss your birth deal. We're not going to be back for that particular party.
*28:55.720- 29:00.140* :  But yes, it's one of those things. You pace yourself, don't you, when you're going away for a while,
*29:00.140- 29:04.600* :  and these people will have paced themselves for a certain next time, suddenly when that becomes
*29:04.600- 29:10.780* :  potentially much longer, that's when it starts to really sink home a bit and you have to settle
*29:10.780- 29:14.640* :  it and you remind how you're going to deal with that. And how about having to spend that amount
*29:14.640- 29:20.820* :  of time with another human being in those quarters? Well, it's not just a two of them, of course.
*29:20.820- 29:25.480* :  So there's the four crew dragon and also the three people who went up on a slow spacecraft.
*29:25.480- 29:30.500* :  It's not just one-on-one. The people who I flew into space, whether they did spend six months
*29:30.500- 29:35.500* :  with just one other person for company. So it's quite, you know, it's humanly possible. It's not
*29:35.500- 29:40.180* :  ideal, of course. Although they'll do the occasional spacewalk while they're up there, there's
*29:40.180- 29:47.060* :  the still, by and large, they are fairly contained in their spacecraft. It's big, you know, you can
*29:47.080- 29:51.820* :  you're plenty of room to stretch out in and plenty of room to go to a part where you can't
*29:51.820- 29:56.300* :  be with other people if you want. Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut.
