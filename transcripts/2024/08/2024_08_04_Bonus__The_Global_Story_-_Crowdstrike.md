*01:23.300- 01:29.120* :  This episode looks at the fallout from the biggest IT outage in history, CrowdStrike.
*01:32.040- 01:36.680* :  A glitch at a major cyber security firm that brought banks, hospitals, airports and
*01:36.760- 01:38.740* :  thousands of businesses to a standstill.
*01:38.900- 01:42.140* :  Chaos and growing passenger outrage as Delta Airways.
*01:42.140- 01:46.200* :  Routine appointments, prescription requests and test results were all affected.
*01:46.200- 01:48.720* :  People had never even heard of CrowdStrike before today.
*01:48.720- 01:51.040* :  Now everybody's wondering how did this happen?
*01:51.460- 01:56.900* :  We live in an ever more digital world and the power to derail it even by mistake is
*01:56.900- 02:00.360* :  concentrated with just a few corporations that keep the whole system running.
*02:01.080- 02:02.940* :  So what do we know about these cyber giants?
*02:03.600- 02:08.460* :  And how vulnerable are they to accidents or attacks that could shut down wide sections
*02:08.460- 02:09.140* :  of society?
*02:11.960- 02:15.180* :  With me today is the BBC's cyber correspondent Joe Tidey.
*02:15.420- 02:15.920* :  Hello, Steve.
*02:16.280- 02:20.640* :  Joe, you're the person we always turn to when we need to understand what's going on in
*02:20.640- 02:21.660* :  the digital world.
*02:22.160- 02:27.520* :  But I wanted to take you back to the day or maybe not even the day the moment where we
*02:27.520- 02:33.900* :  found out about the CrowdStrike outage and what your first gut visceral reaction was.
*02:34.380- 02:39.100* :  Well, I remember well because I was up at about just after 6 a.m. and I looked at a quick
*02:39.100- 02:42.300* :  look at Twitter before I got on with my kind of morning routine stuff.
*02:42.940- 02:44.640* :  And I thought, oh, this is interesting.
*02:44.640- 02:45.820* :  What's happening in Australia?
*02:45.900- 02:46.780* :  Sounds a bit weird.
*02:46.780- 02:49.740* :  Sounds like it's quite serious for the Australians.
*02:49.740- 02:51.440* :  I wonder if that will be a story.
*02:52.020- 02:56.200* :  And what, of course, transpired was that it all started in Australia because that's where
*02:56.200- 02:58.100* :  the people were awake when the update hit.
*02:58.240- 03:04.160* :  It was at about 3 o'clock when suddenly all of our computer screens flashed blue, the
*03:04.160- 03:06.360* :  dreaded so-called screen of death.
*03:07.220- 03:10.500* :  Throughout the morning, it got more and more serious, as obviously more countries came
*03:10.500- 03:14.380* :  online and realised that their computers were also badly damaged.
*03:26.580- 03:32.780* :  And in a real state, because of this cascading wave of chaos around the world.
*03:33.460- 03:35.280* :  So Joe, what actually went wrong?
*03:35.580- 03:39.580* :  CrowdStrike is this cyber security company, one of the giants of cybersecurity at the
*03:39.580- 03:45.760* :  US TechFirm, about a quarter of the market, loads of FTSE 100 and index companies, some
*03:45.760- 03:47.600* :  of the biggest in the world, they use CrowdStrike.
*03:48.300- 03:52.540* :  And what they were doing was putting out a really basic standard update.
*03:52.540- 03:57.960* :  It was a very small file because they'd got some new research on some latest cyber technique
*03:57.960- 03:58.920* :  that hackers were using.
*03:58.920- 04:02.340* :  So they thought, right, we'll just push this out, like we do, you know, four or five times
*04:02.340- 04:03.320* :  a month, something like that.
*04:03.660- 04:06.660* :  But something was terribly, terribly wrong with the code.
*04:06.660- 04:12.400* :  And it caused what we call a logic error or a logic bug, right at the heart of a Windows
*04:13.200- 04:13.220* :  computer.
*04:13.720- 04:16.560* :  This was right to what we call the kernel of a Windows system.
*04:16.560- 04:20.860* :  So if you think about a tree, for example, you think about going down right into the roots
*04:20.860- 04:26.160* :  into the heart of that tree, the foundations that hold it all together, that's where CrowdStrike
*04:26.200- 04:28.940* :  and other products like it are kind of sitting in a system.
*04:29.460- 04:35.080* :  So when they put out an update that goes wrong, like this one, it really can bring everything
*04:35.080- 04:36.100* :  crashing down.
*04:36.700- 04:41.260* :  And this was, they said, due to a problem with their testing, they normally put these
*04:41.260- 04:45.600* :  things through tests, obviously, they would have their own dummy computers that they put
*04:45.600- 04:49.000* :  their code out to first in a quarantined environment.
*04:49.560- 04:54.280* :  And then they put it out in waves normally in waves to their customers around the world.
*04:54.560- 04:55.520* :  They didn't do that here.
*04:55.940- 04:58.640* :  And now they've said, and they promise they are going to start doing that now.
*04:58.640- 05:02.100* :  They're going to improve their testing and Windows are saying also that they're going
*05:02.100- 05:06.560* :  to try and restart the conversation about whether or not products like CrowdStrike should
*05:06.560- 05:09.000* :  have such deep access into Windows machines.
*05:12.280- 05:18.640* :  It was the sheer scale of it, Joe, though, that became the story, the impact, not just
*05:18.640- 05:21.100* :  on people who needed to do their daily work.
*05:21.300- 05:25.840* :  But if you needed to go to the doctor, if you had a flight to catch, if you were trying
*05:25.840- 05:29.560* :  to use online banking, I mean, give us an idea of just how massive this was.
*05:30.020- 05:35.500* :  Millions of computers we now know, 8.5 million computers receive the update automatically
*05:35.600- 05:36.460* :  downloaded it.
*05:36.820- 05:39.480* :  And then in what we call it, it bricked the systems.
*05:39.480- 05:44.660* :  It calls this blue screen of death, which means that your computer is in a kind of reboot
*05:44.660- 05:45.160* :  cycle.
*05:45.220- 05:49.400* :  You can't get out of it unless you get fingers on keyboards and actually turn off the
*05:49.400- 05:51.180* :  computer and get an engineer to look at it.
*05:51.360- 05:53.500* :  It is a huge number of computers.
*05:53.500- 05:57.520* :  But the important thing to remember with this outage is these were really important computers.
*05:57.980- 06:02.400* :  These were computers running airlines, hospitals, banks.
*06:03.060- 06:03.620* :  You name it.
*06:03.720- 06:08.380* :  The biggest companies in the world because CrowdStrike is a quite an expensive product.
*06:08.460- 06:14.800* :  We're talking about a really complex and sophisticated system that's right at the heart
*06:14.800- 06:20.720* :  of your company's computers that's doing a normally a very good job, a very trustworthy
*06:20.720- 06:21.940* :  job of keeping you safe.
*06:22.360- 06:26.240* :  So what happened here was the biggest companies in the world were all brought down and that
*06:26.240- 06:29.520* :  meant, as you say, we had thousands of flights canceled.
*06:29.520- 06:33.760* :  I think I saw a figure this morning about 40,000 worldwide, something like that.
*06:33.760- 06:38.660* :  We saw lots of point of sale terminals in everything from cafes to supermarkets
*06:38.660- 06:41.980* :  go down, lots of offices having nothing to do.
*06:42.280- 06:46.920* :  Don't forget the broadcasters, not the BBC, but one of our main competitors went off
*06:46.940- 06:47.120* :  air.
*06:49.440- 06:49.500* :  Oh, of course.
*06:49.500- 06:50.400* :  Yeah, I mean, this is a problem.
*06:50.400- 06:53.160* :  I forget how many organizations were affected because it was so massive.
*06:53.500- 06:57.000* :  But of course, Sky News, which I used to work for, they were off air for a few hours.
*06:57.580- 07:01.140* :  And in fact, when they managed to get back on air, the presenters using pen and paper
*07:01.140- 07:06.420* :  and talking to each other on mobile phones, and I think was it ABC in Australia was affected
*07:06.420- 07:08.940* :  and they went either off air or massively disrupted.
*07:09.520- 07:13.620* :  So it's really hard to kind of downplay how big this outage was.
*07:13.780- 07:18.220* :  And I know that in cyber, the world is always ending and it's always, you know, things
*07:18.220- 07:18.900* :  are always terrible.
*07:18.900- 07:22.180* :  But this genuinely was the biggest outage I've ever reported on.
*07:22.180- 07:24.680* :  And I think the biggest one since I've been a cyber reporter.
*07:25.440- 07:27.620* :  You might be pleased to know I'm sitting here with a pen and paper.
*07:28.120- 07:28.940* :  Oh, that's cool.
*07:29.380- 07:30.220* :  I'm old school.
*07:30.220- 07:31.540* :  There's no take around me today.
*07:31.880- 07:35.780* :  Joe, my first response when I started to see what was happening in Australia was that
*07:35.780- 07:36.740* :  it was a cyber attack.
*07:37.060- 07:40.120* :  Well, is that common to people jump to that conclusion all the time?
*07:40.360- 07:43.320* :  Every single time it without fail.
*07:43.320- 07:45.120* :  You as soon as I love that you're laughing.
*07:45.440- 07:49.140* :  Well, as soon as as soon as it's a bit of a joke, it's like me.
*07:49.300- 07:53.440* :  Well, it's a bit of a joke in cyber security because people jump to cyber attack.
*07:54.200- 07:54.920* :  I don't know what it is.
*07:54.920- 07:59.240* :  Maybe that's the kind of most dramatic and interesting reason for outages.
*07:59.740- 08:05.380* :  But normally, always, it's something really mundane and really boring that causes these
*08:05.660- 08:06.480* :  giant problems.
*08:07.140- 08:11.460* :  And of course, as soon as people start tweeting about it being a cyber attack, it becomes,
*08:12.020- 08:13.080* :  that becomes the narrative.
*08:13.080- 08:17.880* :  And then you have to work really hard to try to convince people, actually, know someone's
*08:17.880- 08:20.700* :  forgotten to renew a certificate or someone's press the wrong button.
*08:21.420- 08:23.620* :  And how did it, in a way, you've been waiting for this moment?
*08:23.680- 08:26.600* :  Was there a sort of air of inevitability about it?
*08:26.840- 08:32.580* :  No, I mean, we do have outages quite often in cyber, especially with our kind of ultra-connected
*08:32.580- 08:33.420* :  world that we live in.
*08:33.700- 08:38.140* :  And there are many outages that by the time me and the tech team get our heads around
*08:38.140- 08:40.060* :  what's happened, they've already been fixed.
*08:40.500- 08:45.260* :  Let's say, for example, that Twitter is out or Instagram is down.
*08:45.720- 08:47.800* :  And you think, oh, that's affecting a lot of people.
*08:47.800- 08:51.660* :  But almost as soon as you've written it and published it, they've solved it.
*08:52.180- 08:56.780* :  So when you have something like this, which over the course of a few hours, it didn't
*08:56.780- 08:57.700* :  look like it was going away.
*08:57.700- 08:59.460* :  In fact, it looked like it was getting worse.
*08:59.460- 09:02.160* :  You think, okay, yeah, this is a pretty serious situation.
*09:02.600- 09:07.380* :  And not the kind of thing that you expect and sort of have run of the mill that happens
*09:12.600- 09:12.700* :  every week or every month.
*09:12.700- 09:17.860* :  Given CrowdStrike control almost a quarter of the entire cyber security market, and also
*09:17.860- 09:20.040* :  that embarrassed to say, I hadn't really heard of them.
*09:20.500- 09:24.060* :  Yeah, and that's completely understandable because as I say, this isn't your consumer
*09:24.060- 09:24.480* :  product.
*09:24.660- 09:30.220* :  This is kind of really rich companies that that that's the kind of product they use.
*09:30.560- 09:32.020* :  There aren't many companies like that.
*09:32.020- 09:34.440* :  I can probably count, I don't know, four or five of them.
*09:34.460- 09:37.980* :  But CrowdStrike is definitely one of the absolute top top companies.
*09:38.660- 09:43.640* :  With CrowdStrike, you get AI-powered threat protection, industry leading intelligence and
*09:43.640- 09:47.900* :  a team of experts to detect threats and prevent breaches before they happen.
*09:48.260- 09:53.300* :  It was founded in 2011 by Dimitri O'Parevich, who was a cybersecurity expert.
*09:53.300- 09:57.160* :  He's now moved on and he writes lots of books about geopolitics and does podcasts and things.
*09:57.600- 10:02.040* :  It's a very, very trusted brand for these giant multinational companies.
*10:02.040- 10:06.960* :  We have had cybersecurity products put out, dud, updates before.
*10:07.680- 10:11.940* :  But when it's CrowdStrike and when it's this bad, that's when you really feel it.
*10:12.300- 10:16.060* :  And it also showed, I think, how dependent we are on companies like CrowdStrike.
*10:16.560- 10:21.200* :  I mean, are we putting all of our digital eggs into this one basket, Joe, and is that a
*10:21.200- 10:21.500* :  problem?
*10:22.140- 10:25.820* :  Yeah, we've had this debate a couple of times in the last few years because there have
*10:25.820- 10:29.680* :  been big outages, not as big as this, of course, but there have been, for example, when
*10:30.260- 10:36.740* :  in 2021, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, had a six-hour outage.
*10:37.700- 10:41.120* :  We look back now and we think, oh, well, that's a big deal, that's six hours of, you know,
*10:41.120- 10:43.540* :  maybe you can't post pictures of your lunch to your friends or whatever.
*10:43.980- 10:47.700* :  But actually, we know, of course, that around the world, in the developing world, particularly,
*10:48.280- 10:51.720* :  WhatsApp, in particular, that is a huge source of business.
*10:51.720- 10:57.000* :  It is the key piece of software, whether you're a taxi driver or you're a small business
*10:57.000- 11:00.160* :  owner in Bangladesh or Nigeria or India.
*11:00.580- 11:04.840* :  These products are relied upon by hundreds of millions of people and when we have outages
*11:04.840- 11:09.280* :  like this, someone said, I wrote a piece back then about it and someone said this really
*11:09.280- 11:13.420* :  brilliant phrase, which is always stuck with this, when stuff like this happens, you have
*11:13.420- 11:18.080* :  hundreds of millions of people sometimes just sitting and waiting for a small team of engineers
*11:18.080- 11:20.220* :  in California to fix the issue.
*11:23.440- 11:26.600* :  So Joe, I've heard of Meta, but I hadn't heard of CrowdStrike.
*11:27.000- 11:30.980* :  How many other companies are we talking about that could disrupt our daily lives in this
*11:31.000- 11:33.060* :  way if they went down if there was some kind of outage?
*11:33.360- 11:34.040* :  Well, there's a few.
*11:34.200- 11:38.740* :  So there's obviously, I don't know if you've heard of Cloud Flair, but that is a giant
*11:38.740- 11:40.660* :  content management system company.
*11:40.660- 11:45.880* :  They've run huge parts of the internet backbone and there's Fastly as well, which does a similar
*11:45.880- 11:46.120* :  job.
*11:46.520- 11:50.720* :  Akamai, and we have had situations where they've been affected and they've brought down
*11:50.720- 11:55.180* :  not just a few websites, we're talking hundreds or thousands of websites and I'm looking
*11:55.180- 12:00.220* :  at a list now that from a story that I did a couple of years ago and in July 2021, for
*12:00.220- 12:05.940* :  example, there were 48 services, including Airbnb, Expedia, Home Depot, Salesforce that
*12:05.940- 12:12.020* :  went down for an hour when there was a problem with a domain name system of DNS at Akamai.
*12:12.520- 12:15.880* :  So there you go, we're talking about those kind of problems are happening.
*12:16.540- 12:21.280* :  Our reckon probably will have one big one, nowhere near as big as CrowdStrike, but one big
*12:21.280- 12:24.180* :  one probably every year for the last kind of three or four years.
*12:24.320- 12:28.880* :  And the issue we've got, of course, is as these companies become bigger, they become
*12:28.880- 12:33.300* :  better, which means they become more reliable, they become possibly cheaper, more and more
*12:33.300- 12:36.780* :  other companies go all in with them and rely on them so much.
*12:37.280- 12:42.780* :  And you have this issue of giant, not monopolies, but giant companies that just own a huge part
*12:42.780- 12:43.320* :  of the market.
*12:44.000- 12:49.760* :  And part of the issue with a company like CrowdStrike is that when you employ an endpoint
*12:49.760- 12:56.260* :  detection system, like CrowdStrike's Falcon system, you have to embed that into your computer
*12:56.700- 12:56.720* :  network.
*12:56.920- 13:00.860* :  And it takes quite a lot of effort and time and investment to take that out and put a
*13:00.860- 13:01.320* :  new one in.
*13:01.340- 13:05.800* :  And I think what we see is these giant problems, these giant outages from companies that
*13:06.160- 13:10.240* :  not only we rely on without knowing it, but the companies that we use rely on them.
*13:10.340- 13:14.900* :  And they actually are kind of in a sense, they're a bit stuck because yes, they're everything
*13:14.900- 13:19.420* :  works normally, 99% of the time, but when they don't, it's very hard to get out of those
*13:19.420- 13:20.940* :  contracts and get out of those products.
*13:21.740- 13:25.860* :  So Joe, we know that the meta and CrowdStrike outages were accidental.
*13:26.580- 13:30.680* :  And because I do like a bit of drama, as mentioned, I'm one of those people who did lead to
*13:30.680- 13:32.340* :  the notion that it was a cyber attack.
*13:32.460- 13:33.640* :  Can I ask you about that?
*13:33.680- 13:38.400* :  Because surely they're so big, they've got so much influence that they are targets for
*13:38.400- 13:39.100* :  cyber attacks.
*13:40.160- 13:41.340* :  Are they well protected?
*13:41.840- 13:45.940* :  Have they got all the right measures in place to we assume to protect them from cyber
*13:45.940- 13:46.220* :  attack?
*13:46.700- 13:47.740* :  Well, you'd hope so, wouldn't you?
*13:47.740- 13:51.400* :  Because obviously these companies, if we take CrowdStrike, for example, they are, that's
*13:51.400- 13:52.160* :  their business they're in.
*13:52.160- 13:54.720* :  They are experts in protection from cyber attack.
*13:55.240- 13:59.980* :  But I was listening to some analysis recently that said that, wow, there must be what we
*13:59.980- 14:04.720* :  call APTs, advanced persistent threats, which are hacker groups that are government run.
*14:05.060- 14:08.600* :  They must be looking at this, thinking, hang on a minute, why are we trying to hack hundreds
*14:08.600- 14:13.420* :  or thousands of different companies when we can just go for one and we can get 8.5 million
*14:13.420- 14:14.040* :  computers?
*14:14.460- 14:17.920* :  So yeah, I think you'd look at it and you'd think, wow, that's sort of inspirational.
*14:18.620- 14:24.000* :  In a sense, with CrowdStrike's outage, it performed what was the worst downtime that
*14:24.000- 14:26.240* :  you could ever imagine, and it wasn't malicious.
*14:26.240- 14:27.080* :  It was accidental.
*14:27.100- 14:30.100* :  So yeah, you'd think, well, hang on, how can we do that in a malicious way?
*14:30.480- 14:33.420* :  We have seen malicious attacks in the past.
*14:33.900- 14:35.260* :  In 2017, there were two.
*14:35.260- 14:40.060* :  There was the WannaCry attack and there was the NotPeture attack, which were two malicious
*14:40.060- 14:44.880* :  cyber attacks, which spread uncontrollable crypto worms around the world, which locked
*14:44.900- 14:46.000* :  up lots and lots of systems.
*14:46.540- 14:51.420* :  It looked at first like an attack just on hospitals in the UK, but it's now becoming clear
*14:51.420- 14:54.580* :  that this malicious software has run riot around the world.
*14:55.120- 14:59.400* :  Russia, the United States, and many points in between have been hit by what's now,
*14:59.680- 15:01.600* :  a common form of cyber crime.
*15:01.860- 15:05.120* :  But again, we're not talking about the scale of CrowdStrike.
*15:05.380- 15:10.640* :  The WannaCry one, for example, was about 300,000 computers in 150 different countries thought
*15:10.640- 15:11.980* :  to have come from North Korea.
*15:12.340- 15:16.400* :  The NotPeture one was a similar number thought to have come from Russia, that attack.
*15:17.020- 15:21.440* :  So we have seen malicious attacks, nothing like this, and I'm certain, as you say, that
*15:21.440- 15:24.740* :  there will be malicious hackers thinking, well, hang on, this is inspirational.
*15:28.480- 15:33.440* :  So we've looked at how reliant our businesses and institutions are on just a few large
*15:33.440- 15:36.380* :  digital companies and what can happen when there's a problem.
*15:37.020- 15:41.680* :  Next, I'd like to find out how resilient the digital world can be and how worried we
*15:41.680- 15:43.420* :  should be about a worst-case scenario.
*16:20.740- 16:27.240* :  He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa.
*16:28.020- 16:34.620* :  People were desperate, we were looking for him, we couldn't find him, and nobody knew where he was.
*16:35.520- 16:37.980* :  Every single one of his victims was black.
*16:38.820- 16:41.600* :  In each such a state where he was now hunting.
*16:42.760- 16:48.240* :  World of Secrets, from the BBC World Service, Season 3, the apartheid killer.
*16:49.000- 16:52.520* :  Search for World of Secrets, wherever you get the BBC Podcasts.
*17:02.440- 17:03.740* :  This is The Global Story.
*17:04.020- 17:07.800* :  We bring you one big international story in detail five days a week.
*17:08.400- 17:10.060* :  Follow or subscribe wherever you listen.
*17:11.120- 17:13.840* :  I'm speaking to the BBC Cyber Correspondent, Joe Tidy.
*17:15.120- 17:19.680* :  So Joe, we've been talking about the disruption and cause when just one of these big cyber security
*17:20.120- 17:22.620* :  companies or online platform suffer an outage.
*17:23.060- 17:26.500* :  I don't want to sound alarmist, but tell us about the worst-case scenario.
*17:26.500- 17:30.840* :  If we did see several of these service providers or even one of them go down.
*17:31.420- 17:36.200* :  Is that something that people should be worried about, especially as more and more of our world is digitised?
*17:36.840- 17:37.800* :  I don't think so.
*17:38.020- 17:43.420* :  It wasn't an alarming situation when one company like this can cause such havoc.
*17:43.420- 17:49.220* :  But I do have faith that these cyber security companies are well protected, especially after something like this.
*17:49.460- 17:51.540* :  You know, we've been through this, we've kind of got through it.
*17:51.920- 17:57.340* :  And there are so many lessons being learned, not only about a reliance on two few companies,
*17:57.340- 18:01.280* :  but also about testing and protecting systems better.
*18:01.800- 18:06.440* :  I don't think we're in a position where we're going to have simultaneous malicious attacks
*18:06.440- 18:09.180* :  like we saw with CrowdStrike on lots of different companies.
*18:09.860- 18:13.000* :  We have had cyber security companies affected in the past.
*18:13.000- 18:14.420* :  There was the SolarWinds attack.
*18:14.920- 18:17.460* :  Hacker has launched a broad and indiscriminate effort
*18:18.060- 18:22.840* :  to compromise the network management software used by both government and the private sector.
*18:23.300- 18:29.000* :  Which was a malicious attack by thought to be Russia against a cyber security company in the US
*18:29.000- 18:34.720* :  to get inside lots of US departments to kind of do spying, kind of traditional espionage.
*18:35.140- 18:40.820* :  As of today, nine federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies were compromised,
*18:41.660- 18:45.540* :  including networks of companies whose products could be used to launch additional intrusions.
*18:46.360- 18:49.840* :  You could argue that it's not been done to the scale of the SolarWinds attack,
*18:49.840- 18:56.000* :  but no doubt UK, US, Allies all doing the same to other countries, to adversaries.
*18:56.820- 19:01.740* :  But I don't think there's any need for anyone to be really scared about the CrowdStrike thing
*19:02.160- 19:04.540* :  being times by five or something and happening simultaneously.
*19:05.160- 19:07.440* :  You don't need to down tools and move to the woods just yet.
*19:07.820- 19:11.980* :  No, that's good to hear. Can you reassure us then around things like our power,
*19:12.540- 19:17.000* :  you know, the electricity grid, the water systems, even our national defense systems?
*19:17.040- 19:19.200* :  Are they well protected too from outages?
*19:19.700- 19:23.800* :  That's a trickier one. The truth is that there are lots of countries around the world
*19:23.800- 19:26.520* :  which are kind of putting themselves on a war footing.
*19:27.240- 19:33.520* :  And we know, for example, from researchers that China is and has been gaining access
*19:33.520- 19:35.960* :  to critical infrastructure networks.
*19:36.060- 19:40.300* :  A big warning on Capitol Hill yesterday from FBI Director Christopher Ray
*19:40.300- 19:43.180* :  about possible hacking attacks by the Chinese government.
*19:43.380- 19:47.720* :  China's multi-pronged assault on our national and economic security
*19:48.160- 19:51.780* :  make it the defining threat of our generation.
*19:52.860- 19:56.820* :  PRC hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure,
*19:57.440- 20:02.880* :  our water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas pipelines,
*20:03.020- 20:11.500* :  our transportation systems and the risk that poses to every American requires our attention now.
*20:12.560- 20:17.400* :  The kind of issue we have here, of course, is that we don't know how deep that access is.
*20:17.400- 20:21.480* :  We don't know whether or not that's persistent or whether or not they've been kicked out.
*20:21.480- 20:26.440* :  We only hear from one side as well because, of course, all the information that we get
*20:26.440- 20:28.920* :  about hacking comes from Western countries.
*20:29.600- 20:36.300* :  So, for example, there's this Five Eyes Alliance, which is the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
*20:36.320- 20:41.580* :  And they're always putting out warnings to people who run critical infrastructure organizations
*20:42.800- 20:49.160* :  to be aware because about six months ago the warning went out that China is embedding itself inside networks
*20:50.620- 20:55.400* :  ready for if there is some sort of war that they could cause the structure or switch off supplies,
*20:55.400- 20:56.120* :  that kind of thing.
*20:56.620- 21:01.020* :  Absolutely, all countries by our countries by all governments have a need to be covertly informed.
*21:01.820- 21:03.980* :  All countries seek strategic advantage.
*21:04.360- 21:08.500* :  But the behaviour we're talking about here goes well beyond traditional espionage.
*21:09.240- 21:13.220* :  And then about two weeks ago, in fact last week we had warnings from the same alliance
*21:13.260- 21:15.500* :  that North Korea is doing the same.
*21:16.260- 21:21.280* :  But we only hear from that side, so there's no doubt, of course, that the Five Eyes Alliance
*21:21.280- 21:25.060* :  is probably doing the same to China and Russia and North Korea.
*21:25.600- 21:30.520* :  So, there is a sort of imbalance of knowledge here that I've never really been comfortable with as a reporter,
*21:31.080- 21:33.060* :  but it's one that we have to acknowledge is there.
*21:33.520- 21:35.700* :  Otherwise, of course, we're not telling people what's happening.
*21:36.400- 21:42.480* :  We don't know whether or not this could lead to major outages because we haven't been at that kind of world war
*21:42.480- 21:46.240* :  three level of conflict and hopefully we will never get there.
*21:46.560- 21:53.520* :  What we do know is that Russia has on multiple occasions switched off the lights in Ukraine through cyber attacks.
*21:53.580- 21:56.420* :  It happened twice in, I think, 2016.
*21:57.280- 22:00.460* :  And it happened, it was confirmed to have happened this year as well.
*22:01.260- 22:05.820* :  Russia against Ukraine has always been seen as a bit of a kind of testbed for what can go wrong.
*22:05.820- 22:10.000* :  Russia has been attacking Ukraine with cyber for many, many years now.
*22:10.520- 22:16.800* :  And I think what's interesting there is that what we kind of, we've learned by watching and observing the Ukraine conflict,
*22:16.800- 22:22.000* :  is that although cyber is kind of insidious and you can do lots of damage
*22:22.000- 22:25.580* :  and you can cause disruption, nothing will really be a missile.
*22:26.320- 22:28.460* :  Because all the disruption we're seeing in Ukraine,
*22:29.640- 22:34.740* :  none of the cyber stuff comes anywhere near to what we are seeing from kinetic attacks against critical infrastructure,
*22:35.600- 22:37.540* :  networks and factories and facilities.
*22:44.500- 22:48.200* :  Joe, is there an argument that we should be changing the whole way that this works?
*22:48.420- 22:55.800* :  That we're talking about a small number of very big companies having this major influence over the way the world runs
*22:56.560- 22:59.020* :  and that we've got to come up with a different kind of arrangement?
*22:59.540- 23:06.480* :  I suppose that's what monopoly legislation is all about breaking up companies to make them smaller and improve competition.
*23:06.600- 23:09.360* :  I think that is the conversation it's being had right now.
*23:09.360- 23:13.300* :  Obviously it's not for me to say whether or not something like CrowdStrike should be broken up
*23:13.300- 23:20.440* :  or whether or not people should spread their money and spread their investment wider than a few companies.
*23:20.440- 23:25.760* :  But certainly I think it is fair to say that these outages would be a lot smaller and have less impact
*23:25.760- 23:33.200* :  if there were more companies in the mix for your social networks or your content delivery systems or your cyber security products.
*23:33.760- 23:36.060* :  Because what are the consequences now for CrowdStrike?
*23:36.380- 23:39.800* :  There's obviously a massive insurance bill to be paid.
*23:40.160- 23:42.480* :  Whether or not CrowdStrike will foot that bill we don't know yet.
*23:42.480- 23:47.080* :  It's going to take a long time to work out who pays the money here.
*23:47.540- 23:48.820* :  We're talking billions of dollars.
*23:49.360- 23:54.520* :  If you take for example the most visual representation of any IT outage is always for some reason,
*23:55.220- 24:00.520* :  airlines and airports because people are there unhappy with their luggage waiting for their flights.
*24:00.520- 24:03.580* :  They're looking at boards saying cancelled or delayed.
*24:03.840- 24:05.040* :  This is our fourth cancel they said.
*24:05.180- 24:07.900* :  We're just right. We've given up and stayed home.
*24:07.960- 24:11.620* :  We're fine, a key West, but now we cancel everything because you can't even rent cars.
*24:11.740- 24:14.460* :  We barely got a hotel room last night. We were lucky doing that one.
*24:14.580- 24:17.800* :  And every one of those people we always put out on broadcasts,
*24:18.140- 24:19.840* :  they're entitled to compensation obviously.
*24:20.320- 24:21.140* :  So who pays the money?
*24:21.620- 24:26.600* :  I look back at the not-peture attack in 2017 and there was a shipping company called Merck
*24:27.020- 24:29.140* :  which had a huge amount of disruption.
*24:29.220- 24:31.540* :  They were back to pen and paper, couldn't ship things around the world.
*24:32.000- 24:36.920* :  And it cost them hundreds of millions and it took years and years to decide who would pay that bill.
*24:37.660- 24:41.280* :  So Joe, they are surely called for more oversight of the industry after what's happened.
*24:41.680- 24:45.900* :  Oh, definitely. And the CrowdStrike CEO has been called to Senate hearing
*24:45.900- 24:48.820* :  and they're going to be sat there like we've seen lots of times recently.
*24:49.300- 24:50.660* :  Mr Zuckerberg, let me start with you.
*24:50.660- 24:56.020* :  Did I hear you say in your opening statement that there's no link between mental health and social media use?
*24:57.080- 25:00.480* :  With the tech bros sat there kind of being shouted at by senators.
*25:01.020- 25:02.600* :  That's not a question. That's not a question.
*25:02.600- 25:05.160* :  Those are facts, Mr Zuckerberg. That's not a question.
*25:06.340- 25:09.860* :  There's going to be a lot of discussion now over the next couple of years at least just to find out
*25:10.320- 25:12.320* :  how can we prevent this kind of thing happening again?
*25:13.280- 25:18.900* :  Do companies like CrowdStrike need to have legislated better testing, that kind of thing?
*25:19.540- 25:25.000* :  And as mentioned, we are talking now about whether or not there's just too much access to our computers
*25:25.020- 25:26.960* :  that these cyber security companies have.
*25:27.360- 25:32.340* :  Because when you go down to the kernel of a Windows system, you're kind of like you've got
*25:32.340- 25:38.160* :  God mode access to a computer, which is partly why the CrowdStrike product Falcon is good.
*25:38.500- 25:40.360* :  And like others, it's very good at what it does.
*25:40.360- 25:44.080* :  But it also means that when things go wrong, it is absolutely catastrophic.
*25:44.800- 25:48.480* :  So a big picture of philosophical question to end on then, Joe.
*25:48.920- 25:53.460* :  If we look to the future, do you think we as a society will become more resilient
*25:54.260- 25:57.240* :  as technology improves? Or do you think actually we'll get more vulnerable
*25:57.240- 26:00.360* :  because more and more of our lives are taking place online?
*26:00.940- 26:05.400* :  Well, I think there's a really interesting kind of weird issue and situation that we're in
*26:05.400- 26:09.160* :  where the CrowdStrike thing was absolutely massive.
*26:09.520- 26:12.680* :  The outage caused huge amounts of disruption for people around the world.
*26:12.680- 26:16.340* :  But I'm actually quite surprised at how resilient we all were.
*26:17.080- 26:19.260* :  Life went on. Yes, it was really horrible.
*26:19.260- 26:25.540* :  I wasn't sat in those airports looking at the departure boards with my entire family screaming at me.
*26:25.540- 26:28.340* :  So I'm sat here within a sort of privileged position.
*26:28.340- 26:32.440* :  I wasn't kind of at the heart of it. And also I wasn't one of the IT engineers working
*26:32.440- 26:35.120* :  over the weekend to try and get their systems back up and running.
*26:35.120- 26:39.280* :  I know it was horrendous for them. But we did bounce back pretty quickly.
*26:39.940- 26:45.620* :  And I think within about three days, things were pretty much back to normal through lots of pain.
*26:45.620- 26:50.640* :  Yes, but the average person living their everyday life, they kind of were impacted,
*26:50.640- 26:51.620* :  but they got through it.
*26:51.860- 26:56.320* :  So I do feel a little bit positive that if something so bad as the CrowdStrike outage
*26:56.720- 26:59.400* :  meant that life went on, that does sort of fill me with a bit of hope.
*27:00.060- 27:05.040* :  And the other interesting thing I think, which might help us explain why there was quite good resilience,
*27:05.660- 27:10.160* :  is because we have had years now, about four or five years of this thing called ransomware,
*27:10.680- 27:16.200* :  which is a form of cyber attack that brings companies to their knees and encrypts their systems
*27:16.200- 27:17.920* :  and means they can't run their computers.
*27:18.800- 27:21.920* :  And lots and lots of companies have been hit. They're being hit all the time.
*27:22.020- 27:26.520* :  But more importantly, it's become something that every CEO in every company knows about
*27:26.640- 27:28.500* :  and every organization knows about and worries about.
*27:28.500- 27:35.260* :  So I like to think that the resilience is are being built into systems in case ransomware happens.
*27:35.260- 27:39.260* :  And in this sense, the CrowdStrike outage was a bit like a ransomware attack.
*27:39.260- 27:43.000* :  So I think we are in a position where we're learning each time,
*27:43.160- 27:45.520* :  and we've been through years of pain with ransomware,
*27:45.520- 27:49.980* :  that I think if the CrowdStrike outage would have happened maybe four or five years ago,
*27:50.020- 27:51.120* :  it would have been way worse.
*27:52.280- 27:55.020* :  Hope, resilience, learning, that's a good way to end.
*27:55.020- 27:56.780* :  And Joe, do you know what this noise is?
*27:57.720- 28:00.880* :  That is the sound of my pen being put down on the piece of paper.
*28:03.220- 28:03.980* :  You can't hack a pen.
*28:04.280- 28:07.020* :  It can't hack a pen. Thanks so much, Joe. Good to speak to you.

*28:46.060- 28:48.200* :  He was a kind of vigilante killer.

*28:52.940- 28:53.820* :  Very dark times.
*28:54.400- 28:55.380* :  People were desperate.
