*01:44.340- 01:48.140* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:49.680- 01:52.400* :  I'm Janet Jalil, and in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:52.400- 01:55.040* :  the 15th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:55.700- 01:58.420* :  The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of
*01:58.420- 02:03.040* :  epochs in African countries as a public health emergency of international concern.
*02:04.000- 02:06.720* :  Demonstrations have been held across the India to call for an
*02:06.840- 02:12.280* :  end to violence against women after the rape and murder of a doctor at the hospital where she worked.
*02:12.940- 02:17.280* :  Ukraine says it will establish humanitarian corridors in the Russian region of Kursk
*02:17.500- 02:20.060* :  to let civilians escape its military offensive.
*02:22.980- 02:26.020* :  Also in this podcast, a new Stonehenge mystery.
*02:26.480- 02:28.860* :  They must have been very technically advanced to bring it down by boat,
*02:28.860- 02:30.560* :  bring it down on sledges or whatever.
*02:31.220- 02:36.860* :  How its gigantic altestone came from much further away than originally thought.
*02:40.480- 02:44.300* :  The World Health Organization has declared the highly infectious disease
*02:44.300- 02:47.100* :  epochs a global health emergency.
*02:47.800- 02:51.860* :  The virus, formerly known as monkeypox, has spread rapidly in the Democratic
*02:51.860- 02:55.300* :  Republic of Congo and now across Central and Eastern Africa.
*02:56.060- 03:00.240* :  EMPOX can cause fever and a distinctive rash that spreads over the body.
*03:00.980- 03:04.680* :  Most people fully recover, but some get very sick and die.
*03:05.100- 03:09.440* :  The WHO Chief Tedros Adonam-Gebriasis made the EMPOX announcement
*03:09.440- 03:12.180* :  at the organization's headquarters in Geneva.
*03:12.780- 03:17.020* :  Last week, I announced that I was convening an emergency committee
*03:17.660- 03:22.620* :  under the International Health Regulations to evaluate the upsurge of
*03:22.620- 03:28.580* :  epochs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries in Africa.
*03:29.220- 03:34.860* :  Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that in its view,
*03:34.860- 03:39.860* :  the situation constitutes a public emergency of international concern.
*03:40.120- 03:45.560* :  Since the start of the year, nearly 14,000 cases and 450 deaths have been reported
*03:45.560- 03:47.380* :  in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*03:48.080- 03:52.140* :  The WHO announcement comes a day after Africa's top public health body
*03:52.140- 03:53.800* :  also declared an emergency.
*03:54.040- 03:58.480* :  Our Africa Health correspondent, Dorkas Wangira, who's in Nairobi, told us more.
*03:58.760- 04:00.720* :  EMPOX doesn't know any boundaries,
*04:01.400- 04:04.120* :  and just says it has been spreading to countries where they didn't before,
*04:04.120- 04:06.500* :  it is also spreading outside the continent.
*04:06.780- 04:09.800* :  And what does this mean that the WHO has declared
*04:09.800- 04:12.380* :  EMPOX a global public health emergency?
*04:12.820- 04:16.000* :  So this is WHO's highest level of alert.
*04:16.460- 04:18.300* :  It's almost a safety for your houses on fire.
*04:18.300- 04:20.840* :  You'd have to raise their alarm for any action to be done.
*04:21.380- 04:22.980* :  It's not the first time they're doing this.
*04:23.180- 04:25.620* :  Many of audiences may remember in 2022,
*04:26.160- 04:29.720* :  WHO also declared the same alert for EMPOX, then.
*04:30.300- 04:33.560* :  However, this time, what is different is that we are seeing a different
*04:33.560- 04:34.060* :  cleared.
*04:34.660- 04:38.080* :  That means this outbreak is being fueled by a different strain of the virus,
*04:38.640- 04:40.960* :  which is also considered to be a bit more deadly.
*04:41.420- 04:42.680* :  So that is concerning.
*04:42.680- 04:46.100* :  But also, it means that now countries have to work together,
*04:46.440- 04:48.320* :  do surveillance together, to test together.
*04:48.320- 04:50.320* :  It's not just one country's problem.
*04:50.600- 04:51.500* :  It's everyone's problem.
*04:52.200- 04:54.780* :  And a lot of people will be very alarmed by this.
*04:54.780- 04:57.580* :  They'll be worried that we could be seeing a situation like
*04:57.680- 05:01.560* :  the one we saw when COVID was declared a global emergency.
*05:02.000- 05:05.220* :  That's a very important question and also a very valid concern.
*05:05.880- 05:10.160* :  From where we see it, Africa CDC did see that it's a lack issued yesterday
*05:10.420- 05:14.260* :  is not supposed to discourage trade of movement across borders.
*05:14.820- 05:19.060* :  But what people must appreciate is that we land a lot of lessons from COVID-19.
*05:19.560- 05:21.300* :  COVID-19 was a novel virus.
*05:21.340- 05:23.060* :  EMPOX has been here for decades.
*05:23.680- 05:25.660* :  So what people know about it more,
*05:26.000- 05:27.400* :  there is a vaccine for it.
*05:27.680- 05:31.180* :  And in terms of control and prevention, there's better knowledge.
*05:31.500- 05:34.240* :  That is a very important point, isn't it, that there are vaccines.
*05:34.240- 05:37.840* :  But in Africa, there aren't enough vaccines for the people there.
*05:38.160- 05:40.440* :  Yes, and that's the biggest concern because
*05:40.440- 05:42.580* :  Africa needs at least 10 million doses.
*05:42.660- 05:46.720* :  We can only buy 200,000 and be that as it may.
*05:47.120- 05:51.040* :  It will take at least at the earliest in October to have them in the African continent.
*05:51.040- 05:53.740* :  And that's why this a lot is also very important.
*05:53.740- 05:55.240* :  Docus, Wangira.
*05:55.760- 06:00.340* :  To India now, where thousands of women have taken part in reclaim the night marches
*06:00.340- 06:03.800* :  across the country to demand the freedom to live without fear.
*06:04.340- 06:07.300* :  This follows the rape and murder of a hospital doctor last week
*06:07.300- 06:09.320* :  while she was working a night shift.
*06:09.920- 06:13.020* :  The half-naked body of the 31-year-old trainee doctor
*06:13.420- 06:17.840* :  bearing extensive injuries was found by her colleagues at the hospital in Kolkata.
*06:18.440- 06:21.100* :  Since then, doctors in many parts of India have gone on strike
*06:21.100- 06:23.980* :  to demand more be done to protect them while they're at work.
*06:24.640- 06:27.300* :  Police say they've arrested a suspect who worked at the hospital.
*06:27.980- 06:30.260* :  Sam and Ravi sent this report from Kolkata.
*06:31.060- 06:34.640* :  As India prepares to celebrate its 77th Independence Day,
*06:35.320- 06:38.820* :  women here say that although the country got freedom, they didn't.
*06:39.880- 06:44.140* :  They say there is a deep fear of the attack at a leading hospital last week.
*06:45.140- 06:48.460* :  It has brought back memories of the rape and murder of a student
*06:48.460- 06:50.660* :  on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012.
*06:51.620- 06:56.140* :  The incident has again raised questions about women's safety in workplaces in India,
*06:56.300- 06:57.400* :  especially during night shifts.
*06:58.220- 07:02.880* :  Widespread protests by junior doctors have crippled the state healthcare services
*07:03.480- 07:06.520* :  with the functioning of even emergency and outpatient departments
*07:07.000- 07:08.420* :  coming to a halt in many hospitals.
*07:09.480- 07:11.680* :  The movement has quickly spread across the country,
*07:11.960- 07:15.980* :  with Gaya Dhrinsnow being planned in towns and cities including Delhi,
*07:16.600- 07:17.640* :  Bangaluru and Mumbai.
*07:18.160- 07:22.080* :  Salman Ravi, Ukraine says it's setting up humanitarian corridors
*07:22.080- 07:26.660* :  in the Russian region of Kursk to let civilians leave the area where its troops have seized
*07:26.680- 07:30.760* :  large swathes of territory in the past week in its surprising version.
*07:31.480- 07:35.700* :  Giv also says that a buffer zone is being created in the region to prevent Russian
*07:35.700- 07:40.620* :  cross-border shelling. Russia has insisted that it's pushing Ukrainian troops back,
*07:40.620- 07:44.720* :  but the Ukrainians say that they're actually making ever deeper in roads.
*07:45.240- 07:48.160* :  James Khrumasami managed to speak to someone in Kursk.
*07:48.420- 07:51.880* :  Jan Frutschev is a local official with a liberal opposition party,
*07:51.880- 07:55.380* :  Yabloko, and he described the situation in the region.
*07:55.380- 08:01.700* :  The current situation in Kursk is tense.
*08:02.580- 08:06.680* :  Kursk is, of course, the administrative center or the regional capital,
*08:07.320- 08:12.140* :  and there's a large number of people coming from the affected regions,
*08:12.140- 08:14.380* :  the if regions in the conflict zone,
*08:14.800- 08:17.980* :  Sulja, Korineva and Lugov districts by the border.
*08:18.780- 08:23.660* :  People are leaving their homes either by themselves or with the help of evacuation services,
*08:23.660- 08:26.300* :  which are providing transport to them.
*08:26.800- 08:32.540* :  And they're moving to Kursk itself or to other Russian regions or to areas of the region,
*08:32.920- 08:34.280* :  which are currently safe.
*08:35.540- 08:41.480* :  And what are they saying about their experiences in those areas where the
*08:41.480- 08:42.860* :  fighting is taking place?
*08:43.080- 08:43.940* :  All girls, the nyan.
*08:44.260- 08:49.640* :  Citizens that are leaving their homes are in a very difficult psychological situation.
*08:50.200- 08:53.060* :  They've experienced a huge amount of stress and sadness,
*08:53.760- 08:56.200* :  and they're leaving their homes for an unknown period,
*08:56.300- 08:58.640* :  and the things they have seen are definitely not positive.
*08:58.900- 08:59.620* :  Positive, now.
*08:59.740- 09:02.540* :  How would you characterise their mood?
*09:02.840- 09:04.500* :  I'm not saying you're a badablin, now.
*09:04.820- 09:06.640* :  Well, I could describe their mood as depressed.
*09:06.780- 09:11.060* :  They need food, they need clothes, they need hygiene products,
*09:11.800- 09:14.460* :  and to make it clear what kind of numbers we're talking about,
*09:15.180- 09:20.760* :  180,000 people are subject to evacuation from the districts affected,
*09:21.280- 09:25.140* :  so far, 121,000 people have been evacuated,
*09:25.620- 09:29.960* :  and 5,000 children need to be evacuated from these areas
*09:30.220- 09:32.340* :  to safer parts of the country.
*09:36.500- 09:39.880* :  And have you heard of civilian casualties?
*09:43.000- 09:44.820* :  Yes, there have been civilian casualties,
*09:45.500- 09:48.820* :  but I can't provide accurate figures on how many there have been.
*09:49.220- 09:52.920* :  I know of several, a 24-year-old woman was killed
*09:52.920- 09:55.500* :  when her vehicle was shot at during the evacuation,
*09:55.620- 09:57.460* :  her name was Nina Kuznetsova,
*09:58.080- 10:02.040* :  and a man was killed when trying to evacuate from St. Nicholas's monastery.
*10:02.420- 10:06.800* :  Two other men have died fleeing from Korineva district,
*10:07.400- 10:10.680* :  and one of them was killed with a drone strike on the ambulance.
*10:13.320- 10:16.280* :  That was Jan Frutschev, a local official in Kursk.
*10:16.560- 10:18.820* :  A correspondent will learn in his following developments.
*10:19.300- 10:22.260* :  It's difficult to know exactly what's happening there.
*10:22.260- 10:25.160* :  There are very few independent journalists left,
*10:25.620- 10:29.100* :  even in Moscow, let alone journalists who have the right permissions,
*10:29.100- 10:34.760* :  or, frankly, are willing to report from where the fighting is in Kursk region.
*10:34.760- 10:38.340* :  Some Ukrainian journalists have reached the town of Sulja,
*10:38.340- 10:40.660* :  and have sent a TV report from there,
*10:40.980- 10:44.460* :  and Ukrainian troops appear to be in control of most of that town,
*10:44.460- 10:47.860* :  about 5,000 people lived there before the war.
*10:47.860- 10:49.260* :  Things look pretty quiet there.
*10:49.340- 10:51.520* :  The town isn't in ruins or anything like that,
*10:51.520- 10:52.800* :  but the big question, of course,
*10:52.800- 10:56.300* :  is progress, the advance of Ukrainian troops.
*10:56.300- 10:59.560* :  In the region, President Zelensky and his generals say they push on,
*10:59.620- 11:01.860* :  they say they're capturing Russian soldiers.
*11:01.860- 11:03.920* :  Russia says it stopped their advance,
*11:03.960- 11:08.060* :  but I was just browsing some of the pro-Cremlin Russian military bloggers,
*11:08.120- 11:11.840* :  and they appear not to agree with those statements from their leadership.
*11:12.300- 11:14.460* :  Almost all of them say Ukraine has the initiative,
*11:14.880- 11:16.860* :  and that they're advancing through Russian territory.
*11:17.280- 11:18.660* :  As you say, it does seem, for now,
*11:18.660- 11:20.960* :  as if Ukraine's gamble is paying off.
*11:21.060- 11:23.560* :  But what's a strategy longer term?
*11:23.560- 11:26.060* :  First of all, they were talking about not holding on to territory.
*11:26.060- 11:28.100* :  Now they're talking about creating a buffer zone.
*11:28.580- 11:32.540* :  Well, obviously, Ukraine isn't saying publicly what it's true,
*11:32.540- 11:36.200* :  aimed, so I don't want to broadcast them, I'm sure, to its enemies.
*11:36.700- 11:40.560* :  Various analysts have offered a range of options of what this might all be about.
*11:40.560- 11:43.280* :  It might be to boost morale, to show the West
*11:43.620- 11:47.140* :  Ukraine still capable of winning or to draw troops away
*11:47.140- 11:49.920* :  from other parts of the battlefield, such as the Donbass.
*11:50.220- 11:53.780* :  I think this is probably more political than it is strategic.
*11:53.780- 11:58.220* :  That is, it's not designed as a big game-changer in the war.
*11:58.220- 12:01.160* :  It's probably meant to send a message at home and abroad
*12:01.160- 12:03.180* :  that Russia isn't as strong as it seems.
*12:03.840- 12:05.700* :  We're over a week into this now,
*12:05.900- 12:08.780* :  and Russia isn't only not pushing back the Ukrainians,
*12:08.780- 12:11.160* :  but appears to be unable to even stop them.
*12:11.620- 12:15.760* :  And analysts say that perhaps that's because Russia doesn't have enough reserves.
*12:15.760- 12:20.460* :  We know from mothers of conscripts that a conscript troops are being sent
*12:20.460- 12:23.520* :  to the region, that doesn't suggest that there's a elite force
*12:23.520- 12:26.540* :  of Russian soldiers about to repel the Ukrainians.
*12:26.540- 12:28.720* :  We know that there was this big summer offensive
*12:28.780- 12:30.440* :  in the East of Ukraine by Russia,
*12:31.000- 12:33.760* :  in which Moscow sent waves after waves of troops
*12:33.760- 12:35.400* :  against the Ukrainian defensive lines,
*12:35.400- 12:37.280* :  for the sake of a few kilometers.
*12:38.000- 12:42.440* :  And the UK Ministry of Defence said that Russia lost 70,000 troops
*12:43.180- 12:45.500* :  during that offensive over the course of just two months.
*12:45.500- 12:47.140* :  That's a thousand men a day.
*12:47.720- 12:50.660* :  So, you know, it's possible that Russia just doesn't have
*12:51.360- 12:54.360* :  the kind of backup to push the Ukrainians out.
*12:54.360- 12:57.900* :  Ukraine has better intelligence, western satellite data.
*12:58.280- 13:01.520* :  They found a weak spot in the Russian defenses, and they exploited it.
*13:01.740- 13:02.220* :  Will Vernon?
*13:03.160- 13:06.340* :  Well, it's been nearly two years since mysterious explosions
*13:06.340- 13:09.860* :  hit the Nord Stream gas pipelines running under the sea
*13:09.860- 13:11.080* :  from Russia to Germany.
*13:11.780- 13:14.560* :  Since the sabotage attack, which occurred just a few months
*13:14.560- 13:16.900* :  after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*13:17.000- 13:19.900* :  there's been a blame game over who was responsible.
*13:19.900- 13:22.840* :  Russia, Ukraine, or the United States.
*13:23.520- 13:26.320* :  Now, German media is reporting that an arrest warrant
*13:26.320- 13:28.660* :  has been issued for a Ukrainian man
*13:28.660- 13:31.700* :  over the most serious attack on Germany's energy supplies
*13:31.700- 13:33.040* :  since the Second World War.
*13:33.040- 13:36.760* :  I heard more from our correspondent, Tim Berlin, Damian McGuinness.
*13:37.040- 13:39.460* :  According to three German media outlets,
*13:40.140- 13:44.320* :  they did an investigation into who might have placed the explosives
*13:44.600- 13:47.360* :  on these Nord Stream pipelines.
*13:48.080- 13:53.080* :  And they've come up with the name of a man, a Ukrainian citizen,
*13:53.380- 13:55.820* :  who they've identified as Vladimir Z.
*13:57.140- 14:01.480* :  And they say he was part of a team of experienced divers
*14:01.480- 14:04.460* :  who hired a yacht, sailed into the Baltic Sea,
*14:04.980- 14:09.000* :  and then placed the explosives on three of the four pipelines.
*14:09.980- 14:13.080* :  Now, I talked to public prosecutors here in Germany.
*14:13.080- 14:16.020* :  They wouldn't confirm whether an arrest warrant
*14:16.080- 14:17.660* :  had been issued for this man.
*14:18.460- 14:22.700* :  But my colleague, Adam Eastern, talked to the public prosecutor's office
*14:22.700- 14:24.980* :  in Warsaw, and they did confirm.
*14:24.980- 14:29.240* :  They said that Poland had indeed received an arrest warrant,
*14:29.240- 14:31.400* :  a European arrest warrant from Germany,
*14:31.940- 14:34.720* :  and that they had then subsequently gone
*14:34.720- 14:37.960* :  to this man's residence near Warsaw.
*14:38.720- 14:40.480* :  When they got there, though, he had already left,
*14:40.640- 14:44.820* :  and they say that he had left from Poland into Ukraine.
*14:45.520- 14:46.740* :  So the fact that we know what these reports
*14:46.740- 14:49.940* :  that an arrest warrant has been issued for a Ukrainian man,
*14:50.100- 14:53.540* :  does that finally clear up who ordered this attack?
*14:53.980- 14:55.800* :  Not necessarily. Well, in fact, not at all.
*14:56.160- 14:59.580* :  I think what we might possibly know now is who physically
*14:59.580- 15:01.740* :  placed the explosives on the pipelines
*15:01.740- 15:04.740* :  if these reports are true, which some parts of the reports
*15:04.740- 15:06.820* :  are indeed true, according to officials here.
*15:07.760- 15:10.080* :  But that doesn't really give us much of an indication
*15:10.180- 15:11.780* :  of who might have ordered this attack.
*15:12.720- 15:14.580* :  There have, of course, over the years been all sorts
*15:14.580- 15:17.820* :  of conspiracy theories and speculation about
*15:17.940- 15:18.980* :  who might be behind this.
*15:18.980- 15:20.800* :  Some people think it's the Ukrainian state.
*15:20.800- 15:22.100* :  Some people think it's Russia,
*15:22.100- 15:25.160* :  even theories that the Americans are behind it,
*15:25.160- 15:26.120* :  all sorts of ideas.
*15:26.640- 15:28.440* :  And I was to say lots of people might have an interest
*15:28.440- 15:30.100* :  in blowing up this pipeline.
*15:30.880- 15:34.520* :  But just because a Ukrainian citizen placed the explosives
*15:34.720- 15:37.400* :  on the pipeline allegedly, does not mean
*15:37.400- 15:39.540* :  that the Ukrainian state is behind it.
*15:40.220- 15:42.840* :  There are credible reports indicating
*15:42.900- 15:45.220* :  that there possibly might have been people
*15:45.220- 15:47.980* :  within the Ukrainian military who might have known about this,
*15:48.700- 15:50.980* :  where the orders about it, the orders it we don't know,
*15:51.120- 15:53.240* :  but that doesn't necessarily mean that the Ukrainian government
*15:53.240- 15:53.960* :  knew about it.
*15:53.980- 15:55.660* :  There are also other credible reports
*15:55.660- 15:57.980* :  that there are various actors within Ukraine
*15:58.620- 16:02.360* :  and also Russian actors who may or may not be connected
*16:02.360- 16:05.300* :  to the Russian or Ukrainian state.
*16:05.740- 16:07.440* :  So just because someone has a certain citizenship
*16:07.440- 16:10.920* :  doesn't really mean that the country there is innocent of
*16:11.240- 16:13.500* :  is necessarily behind the attack officially.
*16:14.040- 16:17.660* :  Damian McGinnis, a police officer in the US state
*16:17.660- 16:20.200* :  of Ohio facing murder charges for the shooting
*16:20.200- 16:22.940* :  of a pregnant black woman last year has appeared in court.
*16:23.520- 16:26.240* :  21-year-old Takaya Young was in her car
*16:26.240- 16:29.400* :  when officer Connor Grubb and a colleague approached her.
*16:29.580- 16:30.860* :  Here's Emma Vardy.
*16:31.260- 16:34.880* :  Bodycam video shows police approaching Takaya Young in her car
*16:35.140- 16:37.260* :  and attempting to stop her from driving away
*16:37.260- 16:40.160* :  so they could question her about a alleged shoplifting.
*16:40.820- 16:43.580* :  In the video Takaya Young appears to drive towards
*16:43.580- 16:46.060* :  officer Connor Grubb, who fired a shot
*16:46.060- 16:48.140* :  as she was ordered to get out of her car.
*16:48.540- 16:50.320* :  She and her unborn daughter were killed.
*16:50.720- 16:52.960* :  Today he appeared in court for the first time
*16:52.960- 16:55.800* :  after a grand jury found that there was sufficient evidence
*16:55.800- 16:58.160* :  for him to be charged with murder and assault.
*16:58.160- 17:01.400* :  The officers' lawyers say that he was hit by the vehicle
*17:01.800- 17:03.280* :  and that he fired in self-defense.
*17:03.340- 17:04.340* :  Emma Vardy.
*17:05.200- 17:08.260* :  Afghanistan is dealing with one of the biggest influx
*17:08.360- 17:10.640* :  of returning refugees in decades.
*17:11.360- 17:15.440* :  Around 700,000 Afghan refugees have been expelled back
*17:15.440- 17:18.940* :  to Afghanistan from Pakistan in less than a year.
*17:19.620- 17:21.240* :  Pakistan says they're being sent back
*17:21.240- 17:22.620* :  because of security concerns
*17:22.620- 17:25.860* :  and because it's struggling economy simply can't handle them.
*17:26.240- 17:28.360* :  But Afghanistan is already going through
*17:28.360- 17:30.720* :  one of the world's worst humanitarian crises
*17:31.260- 17:33.820* :  and aid organisations are worried this influx
*17:33.820- 17:36.360* :  could lead to further destabilisation.
*17:37.100- 17:40.120* :  The BBC's Afghan service reporter Hafiz Marouf
*17:40.400- 17:42.780* :  has visited returning in eastern Afghanistan
*17:43.560- 17:45.700* :  who are facing a bleak future.
*17:50.800- 17:52.900* :  At the basic crossing point in Thurkham,
*17:52.900- 17:57.160* :  eastern Afghanistan, families arrive home with heavy heart.
*17:58.000- 18:00.800* :  The queues are long, the heat and beridol.
*18:03.420- 18:06.620* :  Children in the elderly are carried in well boroughs,
*18:07.180- 18:09.680* :  barely surviving as the temperature sourced
*18:09.680- 18:11.720* :  more than 43 degrees Celsius.
*18:12.740- 18:15.760* :  Hundreds of expelled Afghan's face this every day.
*18:21.180- 18:24.520* :  Rahmatullah has just arrived with 16 family members.
*18:26.100- 18:28.600* :  They lived in Pakistan for 46 years
*18:29.480- 18:31.000* :  and had a well-established life.
*18:32.180- 18:34.900* :  What is waiting for them here in Afghanistan
*18:34.900- 18:38.780* :  is poverty, lack of shelter, unemployment
*18:39.720- 18:41.780* :  and no school for their teenage girls.
*18:44.400- 18:47.400* :  I swear it hurts, it is really painful.
*18:48.560- 18:51.740* :  Now I have to solve a new life because I lost my home.
*18:51.740- 18:54.520* :  All I've got here is a room and a yard.
*18:54.960- 18:59.000* :  Rahmatullah's mother Nurna Ma left Afghanistan in 1978
*19:00.100- 19:01.840* :  just before the Soviet invasion.
*19:02.060- 19:05.540* :  For her it has been an emotional and tough journey back home.
*19:08.640- 19:11.780* :  They beat us and chased us out of the country, she says.
*19:12.700- 19:13.600* :  That is how we left.
*19:14.320- 19:15.380* :  It wasn't over choice.
*19:18.380- 19:22.740* :  So for about 700,000 Afghan's have been expelled from Pakistan
*19:23.160- 19:25.980* :  and around half of them live in Ninghahar province
*19:26.500- 19:27.740* :  close to Pakistani border.
*19:30.820- 19:34.340* :  24-year-old Ruzina was expelled seven months ago
*19:35.280- 19:38.400* :  and has since been living in a shabby tent with her two kids.
*19:39.360- 19:41.700* :  When she first arrived there was no shelter.
*19:44.360- 19:46.020* :  I was born and raised in Pakistan.
*19:46.880- 19:48.120* :  Here I am with my in-laws.
*19:48.980- 19:51.680* :  They lent me a tent where I sleep with my children.
*19:52.700- 19:54.300* :  I never expected this situation.
*19:54.740- 19:58.720* :  Back in Pakistan, Ruzina worked as a tailor to feed her children.
*19:59.560- 20:04.500* :  And Taliban controlled Afghanistan, finding a job as a woman won't be easy.
*20:04.500- 20:09.000* :  The Taliban government admits it cannot deal with the crisis alone.
*20:09.540- 20:13.440* :  These expulsions are adding to Afghanistan's current humanitarian crisis.
*20:14.140- 20:17.160* :  90% of the population are below the poverty line.
*20:17.940- 20:21.120* :  And newly appointed UNHCR director for Afghanistan,
*20:21.120- 20:24.860* :  Arafat Jamal says the funding has dropped by one third.
*20:25.380- 20:28.740* :  The worst thing that could happen is that you have large numbers of returns.
*20:29.480- 20:31.760* :  They find themselves in an unstable situation
*20:31.760- 20:34.920* :  and they go right back to the neighboring countries.
*20:35.340- 20:38.880* :  Afghanistan has one of the world's largest refugee populations.
*20:39.660- 20:44.520* :  And Pakistan alone to deport another 1 million Afghans by the end of the year.
*20:45.400- 20:50.660* :  For Afghanistan's shaky and deeply dependent economy, this is a major concern.
*20:52.020- 20:54.260* :  In the remote outskirts of the city,
*20:54.780- 20:58.600* :  Ruzina gently holds her daughter, Mariam's hand.
*20:58.600- 21:04.080* :  Hoping one day she can soon stand on her own feet and feed her kids,
*21:04.700- 21:07.380* :  she has no idea what the future holds for them.
*21:08.200- 21:14.000* :  For many attorneys like her, the only choice is to face the brunt of this crisis.
*21:14.440- 21:18.320* :  That report by Hafiz Marou from the BBC's Afghan Service.
*21:21.420- 21:22.020* :  Still to come.
*21:22.020- 21:27.080* :  We've got big falls and we're going to see lots more rain in the days ahead.
*21:27.520- 21:30.040* :  I'm actually going to need to stop for a second.
*21:30.040- 21:34.660* :  Some of you may know that I occasionally get affected by some panic attacks.
*21:35.080- 21:39.340* :  A weatherman tells us how scared it is to feel little life on television.

*22:51.320- 22:55.980* :  Talks aimed at ending Sudan's devastating civil conflict have begun in Switzerland,
*22:55.980- 22:59.280* :  but neither of the warring sides has shown up for the negotiations.
*23:00.020- 23:04.000* :  Fighting between the army and the paramilitary rapid support forces has killed
*23:04.000- 23:07.760* :  thousands of people, driven around 10 million from their homes,
*23:08.380- 23:12.120* :  and sparked what the UN has called the world's worst hunger crisis.
*23:12.740- 23:13.840* :  Image in folks reports.
*23:13.840- 23:19.500* :  The Sudanese armed forces indicated some days ago they would not attend these talks,
*23:20.220- 23:24.760* :  saying agreements on access for aid agencies and protection of civilians
*23:24.760- 23:26.460* :  should be implemented first.
*23:27.300- 23:30.980* :  Now the rapid support forces who have come to Switzerland
*23:31.540- 23:35.040* :  have declined to participate too, for today at least.
*23:35.740- 23:38.860* :  Tom Periello, the American envoy leading the talks,
*23:38.860- 23:45.580* :  warned the warring parties against any idea that victory on the battlefield was a real alternative.
*23:45.580- 23:50.920* :  Extremely not based in reality is how we would judge any opinion that one side can win this war
*23:50.920- 23:54.800* :  militarily, because right now one and every two Sudanese,
*23:54.800- 24:00.140* :  a 50 million Sudanese are in harm's way, having had to flee homes, facing a cute hunger,
*24:00.460- 24:04.740* :  and the outpouring for the Sudanese people in favor of these negotiations has been overwhelming.
*24:04.940- 24:08.400* :  Sudan has become the world's biggest humanitarian crisis
*24:09.080- 24:11.740* :  with millions displaced and famine spreading.
*24:12.440- 24:16.860* :  Aid agencies are regularly attacked and scarcely able to work.
*24:17.440- 24:20.560* :  Access for them is top of the agenda at the talks.
*24:20.740- 24:26.600* :  Diplomats from the United Nations as well as neighboring countries are all in attendance.
*24:27.360- 24:30.540* :  For the warring parties, the door is still open.
*24:31.400- 24:32.040* :  Image in folks.
*24:32.720- 24:38.160* :  What was meant to be an eight-day trip to space for two American astronauts could now become
*24:38.160- 24:43.840* :  an eight-month stay. Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, also known as Butch,
*24:43.840- 24:47.520* :  traveled to the International Space Station in June on Boeing's Starliner,
*24:48.120- 24:51.340* :  but its face technical issues which has stopped them returning to Earth.
*24:51.860- 24:57.300* :  NASA officials now say the astronauts could be in orbit until early next year,
*24:57.300- 24:59.180* :  if they can't return on Starliner.
*24:59.860- 25:04.540* :  Extra supplies are on the way to the astronauts from Earth, and according to NASA's Ken Bauersox,
*25:04.540- 25:11.500* :  himself a former astronaut, the pair on the ISS are enjoying their unexpected extra time in space.
*25:12.200- 25:17.700* :  Right now, Butch and Sunny are well engaged on board the International Space Station.
*25:18.100- 25:22.760* :  I know if I was in their position, I'd be really happy to be there, and I'd be happy to have
*25:22.760- 25:29.560* :  the extra time. It's great to be there enjoying the environment, even at great space food,
*25:29.720- 25:31.520* :  and being able to look out the window.
*25:32.020- 25:39.560* :  So, I know that they're making the best of this time, but I'm sure they're eager for a decision
*25:39.560- 25:40.820* :  just like the rest of us.
*25:40.940- 25:45.040* :  Well, NASA is hoping to work out a firm date when the stranded astronauts will return
*25:45.620- 25:46.560* :  by the end of the month.
*25:46.980- 25:53.260* :  One option, if the Boeing spacecraft can't be fixed, is using a SpaceX craft from the company owned
*25:53.260- 25:59.720* :  by Elon Musk. Leroy Chao is a retired NASA astronaut. Here's his assessment of the situation.
*26:00.280- 26:06.040* :  Obviously, disruptive of your life, your plans, but on the other hand, Butch and Sunny are
*26:06.040- 26:11.040* :  consummate professionals. Their astronauts, astronauts enjoy being in space. They're being productive.
*26:11.640- 26:16.460* :  Certainly, the NASA planners and schedulers are taking advantage of the extra hands up there,
*26:16.880- 26:22.300* :  and they are in no danger. So, it's not an entirely bad deal, even though they hadn't planned to be
*26:22.300- 26:26.780* :  up there for, you know, possibly up to eight months. NASA and Boeing engineers are going over
*26:26.780- 26:31.300* :  everything conducting tests that they have been doing for the last two months, trying to determine
*26:31.900- 26:36.620* :  exactly what is the root cause that caused five of these thrusters to fail during the approach
*26:36.620- 26:42.200* :  and docking to the ISS. And until they can get to that root cause, it's difficult to justify
*26:42.200- 26:47.880* :  in the absence of another emergency, you know, putting these two astronauts back on that vehicle to
*26:47.880- 26:54.680* :  mom. Leroy Chao, a retired NASA astronaut. Pioneering research has revealed a surprise at the heart
*26:54.680- 27:00.400* :  of Stonehenge, the circular, near-lithic monument in southern England whose origins are shrouded in
*27:00.400- 27:06.440* :  mystery. The six-ton altestone, once thought to have come from Wales, was in fact transported from
*27:06.440- 27:12.280* :  far further away from North East Scotland. Our science correspondent Palab Gosh explains the
*27:12.280- 27:17.440* :  significance of this discovery. Stonehenge is one of the world's most famous prehistoric monuments.
*27:17.440- 27:23.500* :  It was built five thousand years ago, but essentially it's a stone circle with a horseshoe
*27:23.760- 27:30.220* :  in its centre, right at the centre, is an altestone, and people have wondered for hundreds of years
*27:30.700- 27:36.120* :  what it's for, with no real answer, it's a kind of mysterious place. But the thought is that it was
*27:36.120- 27:43.300* :  a place of worship and ceremony. And the thought was that it had come from Wales, which is not a huge
*27:43.300- 27:50.480* :  distance away from South West England, but now this new analysis reveals that actually it came
*27:50.480- 27:56.760* :  from far further away from the North of Britain from Scotland 700 kilometres away. The altestone
*27:56.820- 28:04.360* :  looked a bit different. Last year a group from Wales discovered that it wasn't from Wales at all,
*28:04.520- 28:11.220* :  but that left the mystery where was it from. And so this latest piece of research has been done by
*28:12.060- 28:19.660* :  another Welshman who has found that it actually originated from Scotland. And he's done this by
*28:19.940- 28:24.340* :  analysing the rock and kind of sourcing where it comes from because rocks from different regions
*28:24.340- 28:29.480* :  have their unique fingerprint if you like almost. So there are two things that you can do to rocks.
*28:29.480- 28:34.760* :  I mean rocks seem really boring to people, but they're actually fascinating because they tell us
*28:34.760- 28:40.920* :  about the planet and also about Stonehenge in this case. So rocks have got their own unique composition
*28:41.400- 28:46.160* :  and also their own unique dates. And you put the two of them together and it's like a fingerprint.
*28:46.160- 28:52.360* :  But a fingerprint on its own is no good unless you have a fingerprint database. So the researcher
*28:52.360- 28:59.400* :  Antony Clark now works at Curtin University in Western Australia who do have the best rock
*28:59.400- 29:05.740* :  fingerprint database in the world. And they isolated it to Northeastern Scotland in an area called
*29:05.740- 29:15.260* :  the Orcadian Basin, which is more than 700 kilometres away. And it's a huge mystery as to how it could
*29:15.260- 29:22.160* :  have been bought all this way to drag it, either I sledge or through logs or whatever, is a huge
*29:22.160- 29:29.340* :  undertaking. And one of his fellow researchers Nick Pierce was speculating as to how they might
*29:29.340- 29:33.380* :  have done it. They must have been very technically advanced to be able to do that to bring it down by
*29:33.380- 29:38.280* :  boat, bring it down on sledges or whatever. And presumably it wasn't just a matter of
*29:38.420- 29:43.700* :  engineering. There must have been some sort of social cohesion for, you know, the Scots and the
*29:43.700- 29:49.700* :  wealth and the English all to work together. Absolutely. To bring this to here, I sort of focus
*29:49.700- 29:56.460* :  in a way at that time. There must have been linking between all of these areas. And Palab,
*29:56.460- 30:03.480* :  do we have any idea why these people who brought this stone all the way from Scotland would have
*30:03.480- 30:09.700* :  chosen to bring that rather than choosing one that's much nearer? Well, that's the new question
*30:09.700- 30:16.220* :  that's arisen. Clearly, it was very important for them. It was a hirculane effort. However,
*30:16.220- 30:23.460* :  they bought it along. But what it does show was just how connected the different parts of Britain
*30:23.460- 30:30.100* :  were at the time. So in a way, it suggests that near-Lithic Britain was in some way perhaps more
*30:30.100- 30:35.700* :  sophisticated, more technologically advanced and perhaps more connected than we previously thought.
*30:36.040- 30:41.380* :  Palab ghosts. Millions of people around the world suffer from panic attacks. It can be scary
*30:41.380- 30:46.200* :  for the person it's happening to, but also for those who witnessed it. Well, an Australian weather
*30:46.200- 30:53.460* :  presenter, Nate Bern, had a panic attack while he was live on ABC television. We've got big falls
*30:53.460- 30:58.900* :  right through that part of the country. And we're going to see lots more rain in the days ahead.
*30:59.360- 31:03.880* :  I'm actually going to need to stop for a second. Some of you may know that I occasionally
*31:03.880- 31:10.880* :  get affected by some panic attacks. And actually, that's happening right now. Lisa, maybe I could
*31:10.880- 31:15.560* :  hand back to you. Well, the weatherman spoke to John Donnison about what had happened.
*31:16.880- 31:25.260* :  I had one of the worst experiences you can have on air, followed by immediately one of the best
*31:25.300- 31:31.080* :  experiences you can have on air, which is being looked after by the people around you to make
*31:31.080- 31:37.280* :  sure that you're okay. And so that what goes out to everyone else is as seamless as possible.
*31:38.480- 31:43.860* :  Why I was literally having a physical reaction that made me just want to run away.
*31:44.240- 31:51.260* :  So when did you begin to feel unwell? Once you started on air or were you feeling anxious,
*31:51.260- 31:56.020* :  I suppose, before you went on air? Originally when it happened, it was because I ran into the studio,
*31:56.020- 32:00.980* :  I was a little bit out of breath. And like, you know, John, when we talk on air, you know,
*32:00.980- 32:08.020* :  you control your, the way you breathe informs how your voice works. So I was doing all of that,
*32:08.020- 32:12.940* :  but because I was just that little bit out of breath, I did a bad job of breathing, which is not
*32:12.940- 32:19.380* :  a good thing to do as a human. And I think the first time that happened, I starved my brain
*32:19.380- 32:25.300* :  of oxygen by a little bit and it went, oh, no, no, this is not good. We don't want this to happen
*32:25.300- 32:30.660* :  again. And so the next time I was at that place in that position, seeing in the auto queue,
*32:30.660- 32:36.240* :  his night with the weather, my brain went all danger, danger, danger. So that was five years ago.
*32:36.520- 32:42.420* :  But what happened earlier this week was a bit of a repeat performance. This specific day when they
*32:42.420- 32:47.580* :  called me at 625 and said, oh my gosh, we need you in the studio right now. I was several minutes
*32:47.580- 32:52.180* :  before I had to be on air. So I rushed into the studio because of tiny bit out of breath,
*32:52.620- 32:57.800* :  stood in that ice where I originally had my panic attack. And that's why I had another one.
*32:57.980- 33:03.560* :  And you mentioned the one five years ago. I mean, do you suffer from them more frequently than that?
*33:03.680- 33:09.140* :  On average, it's about once a year, maybe once or twice a year. And it's only ever in those
*33:09.640- 33:14.120* :  times when I'm extra stressed. Something else is going on. I've got to run into the studio.
*33:14.580- 33:18.860* :  For me personally, it's normally attached to the way I breathe. Now, you've got quite a lot of praise
*33:18.860- 33:25.080* :  for talking about your condition of suffering from panic attacks. I mean, why did you want to talk
*33:25.080- 33:29.860* :  about it? I just realized, there's no shame in this. This is something that happens. It's part of
*33:29.860- 33:36.880* :  being a human. It's something that physiologically can and does happen without any input from
*33:36.920- 33:43.160* :  the person that is happening to. It's just normal. And so why not talk about it? It would be ridiculous
*33:43.160- 33:48.700* :  not to because if I knew when it happened to me that it was a normal thing, I would have been far
*33:48.700- 33:52.860* :  less worried. And I probably wouldn't have been as bad as it was because I didn't know.
*33:53.040- 33:58.480* :  I actually had to do a piano exam last year. And that's all, you know, I handled kind of pressure
*33:58.840- 34:03.820* :  quite well. And I went, it was only grade one piano. So all the other people being tested
*34:03.820- 34:08.160* :  were about six years old. But I was so nervous. I had a kind of similar experience.
*34:08.420- 34:12.860* :  John, I was a naval officer for 12 and a half years. Like I've been to the Middle East. I've been
*34:12.860- 34:18.080* :  in active zones. But you know, like high stress situations. Yeah, I've been there.
*34:18.100- 34:22.980* :  It's a complex thing. Yeah. It's something so many of us experience. And actually, that's
*34:23.040- 34:28.220* :  most of what I've gotten from people is just like, wow, I've experienced this too. And I didn't know
*34:28.220- 34:35.760* :  everyone did. ABC Weather presenter, Nate Bern. And that's all from us for now. But there will be
