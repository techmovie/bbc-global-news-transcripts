*01:31.780- 01:34.500* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:37.440- 01:40.980* :  I'm Chris Barrow and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 21st of August,
*01:40.980- 01:45.860* :  these are our main stories. The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has ended his tour of
*01:45.860- 01:49.020* :  the Middle East with the prospect of a Gaza peace deal still in the balance.
*01:49.620- 01:52.980* :  Africa's main public health agency has announced plans to make 10 million
*01:52.980- 01:57.660* :  unboxed vaccines available for use across the continent. The first flight has taken off as part
*01:57.660- 02:02.660* :  of a US-funded scheme to return migrants from Panama to Colombia to stop them traveling on to the
*02:02.660- 02:10.140* :  United States. Also in the podcast, they hold the ice only in their hand for too long. It's going
*02:10.140- 02:14.980* :  to start to melt. We are really advocating for lots of different essential experiences.
*02:15.560- 02:20.340* :  Scientists in the UK say there should be a new way of teaching science in schools with a focus
*02:20.340- 02:28.220* :  on real life. We begin in the Middle East and the United States is pushing for a cease-fire
*02:28.220- 02:33.660* :  deal with new urgency as political pressure mounts on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*02:34.240- 02:38.360* :  Standing in front of a US Air Force plane at an airport in the Katari capital Doha,
*02:38.360- 02:42.400* :  as he ended his ninth visit to the region since the Israel-Gaza war began,
*02:42.880- 02:47.600* :  the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stressed that a cease-fire deal must get done in the coming
*02:47.600- 02:55.560* :  days. With our partners in Egypt and Qatar, our message is simple, it's clear and it's urgent.
*02:56.020- 03:01.380* :  We need to get the cease-fire and hostage agreement over the finish line and we need to do it now.
*03:01.800- 03:06.480* :  Time is of the essence. Time is of the essence because with every passing day,
*03:06.480- 03:11.080* :  the well-being and lives of the hostages are in jeopardy. Time is of the essence because every
*03:11.080- 03:17.740* :  single day women, children, men in Gaza are suffering without access to adequate food,
*03:18.660- 03:25.600* :  medicine, and at risk of being wounded or dying in fighting that they didn't start and they cannot
*03:25.600- 03:30.480* :  stop. And time is of the essence because with every passing day, there's the danger of escalation
*03:30.480- 03:36.940* :  in the region, escalation that we've been working to prevent from day one since October 7th.
*03:37.200- 03:44.140* :  With Egypt and with Qatar, we're united in purpose and united in action. We're working in
*03:44.140- 03:51.280* :  our different ways to try to ensure that there is not escalation, sending the necessary messages
*03:51.280- 03:57.920* :  to all of the potential actors, including Iran, including Hezbollah, to avoid taking any steps
*03:57.920- 04:03.940* :  that could escalate the conflict. The United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza
*04:04.280- 04:11.620* :  by Israel. More specifically, the agreement is very clear on the schedule and the locations
*04:11.620- 04:17.640* :  of IDF withdrawals from Gaza. And Israel has agreed to that. Gaza is in many ways the key
*04:18.080- 04:22.800* :  to making sure that we can actually move things in the north and Lebanon and Hezbollah in a better
*04:22.800- 04:26.860* :  direction. It's the key to helping make sure that we can take down the temperature in the Red
*04:26.860- 04:32.160* :  Sea with the Houthis. It's the key to seeing if we can pursue a normalization agreement between
*04:32.160- 04:37.700* :  Israel and Saudi Arabia, which both countries remain very interested in. It's the key to
*04:38.700- 04:44.940* :  actually putting everyone, starting with Israel, on a path to a greater peace and security.
*04:44.940- 04:50.360* :  And of course, it's key to getting the hostages home. Earlier, a senior Biden administration official
*04:50.360- 04:54.620* :  pushed back at reported comments by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*04:54.960- 05:00.120* :  accusing him of making maximalist statements that were not constructive. In Israel itself,
*05:00.120- 05:05.020* :  the opposition leader, Yael Lapid, called for an immediate ceasefire and accused Mr Netanyahu
*05:05.020- 05:10.540* :  of trying to scupper current negotiations. Mr Lapid said a deal was needed before all the hostages
*05:10.540- 05:16.640* :  died. I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem, we're a Davis. This is the overriding concern for
*05:16.640- 05:21.040* :  most Israelis, if not all Israelis, while they might support some of their government's war
*05:21.040- 05:25.660* :  aims in Gaza. What they do want is a peace deal because they think that's the best way of getting
*05:25.660- 05:31.020* :  the remaining hostages freed. This has been a theme for the last few months every night
*05:31.020- 05:36.700* :  in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, other Israeli cities that are protest, calling on the government to do
*05:36.700- 05:41.500* :  more to release the hostages. They're not convinced that Mr Netanyahu's priority
*05:42.100- 05:47.040* :  is the hostages they think his priority is what he calls a total victory over Hamas,
*05:47.040- 05:52.940* :  First and foremost. And the fact that six hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel today
*05:53.200- 05:57.960* :  is another reminder to the families of the remaining hostages that the time is running out
*05:57.960- 06:03.020* :  for them. I'm guessing those families are calling for more to be done as you might imagine.
*06:03.180- 06:08.660* :  Absolutely. A lot of people, perhaps internationally and domestically, think that Netanyahu's aims
*06:08.660- 06:13.380* :  are these military aims. And he, of course, is supported by people he needs in his government,
*06:13.380- 06:17.780* :  that he's got far right wing ministers who don't want to be talking to Hamas. They don't
*06:17.780- 06:23.180* :  want to be talking to anybody really until what they regard as a total military victory when Hamas
*06:23.180- 06:27.500* :  is completely defeated and crushed. There are dissenters in his own government, his own defence
*06:27.500- 06:32.840* :  minister has said last week that a total military victory is nonsense, but you cannot completely
*06:32.840- 06:37.800* :  defeat Hamas, but you have to make compromises and, perhaps, achieve a peace deal without having
*06:37.800- 06:43.000* :  achieved that goal. And I think is what more and more people in Israel would like Mr Netanyahu
*06:43.100- 06:48.140* :  to do. Now, Anthony Blinken has been meeting presidents to try and get this resolved.
*06:48.140- 06:53.020* :  How much progress is he making on the diplomatic front? It's really difficult to say because
*06:53.020- 06:58.920* :  when Mr Blinken left Israel, he seemed to have got some sort of tacit agreement for Mr Netanyahu
*06:58.920- 07:04.720* :  to agree to the next stages before, you know, talking about a peace deal. But then Mr Netanyahu
*07:04.720- 07:09.680* :  seems to have told a domestic audience in Israel today that Israel will retain control over
*07:09.680- 07:14.620* :  the southern parts of Gaza, which is one of the key points for Hamas. Maybe some of his
*07:14.620- 07:18.780* :  entourage have been somewhat disappointed by what Mr Netanyahu is maybe saying in public
*07:18.780- 07:23.920* :  and what he's saying in private. But, of course, last night when Mr Blinken left Israel, he made
*07:23.920- 07:29.400* :  it clear that he expected Hamas now to agree to some sort of bridging agreement which would lead
*07:29.400- 07:36.080* :  allow peace talks to continue in Cairo on Friday. The problem is that most observers on the ground
*07:36.080- 07:42.180* :  look at the real politic of continuing Israeli military operations in Gaza and also in southern
*07:42.180- 07:48.500* :  Lebanon, continuing Hamas in transigence. And the realistic prospects for a peace deal and the
*07:48.500- 07:54.400* :  release of hostages, I still think, are very, very slim. We're a Davis in Jerusalem. Now to Russia,
*07:54.400- 07:59.480* :  where President Vladimir Putin has a message for the people involved in Ukraine's incursion into
*07:59.480- 08:05.060* :  the Kursk region. He was speaking at an event commemorating the 2004 Buslan school siege
*08:05.060- 08:11.980* :  when more than 300 people were killed. The same way we fought terrorists previously,
*08:12.540- 08:17.540* :  now we fight those who commit crimes in Kursk region. But just as we achieved our goals in the
*08:17.540- 08:23.540* :  fight against terrorism, so we will achieve our goals in the fight against neo-Nazism. And we will
*08:23.540- 08:28.940* :  certainly punish the criminals. There can be no doubt about that. Ukraine says it's destroyed the
*08:28.940- 08:34.120* :  main three bridges over the river same in the past two weeks. Russia's latest bulletin says it's
*08:34.120- 08:39.280* :  now evacuating people with civilian boats. At the same time, Ukraine's parliament has voted to
*08:39.280- 08:44.360* :  ban the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has historic links to Russia, further rejecting Russian
*08:44.360- 08:50.220* :  cultural and spiritual influence. I spoke to our Russia editor at BBC Monitoring Vitaly Chevchenko
*08:50.480- 08:57.500* :  and I began by asking him about developments in the Kursk region. The latest we have is from the
*08:57.500- 09:05.280* :  Ukrainian top general who says that the Ukrainian forces are up to 35 kilometers deep in
*09:05.280- 09:15.840* :  Russia's Kursk region and they control 1,263 square kilometers of land, including 93 settlements.
*09:15.840- 09:21.900* :  Now, why am I giving these numbers? This is 13 square kilometers more and one settlement more than
*09:21.900- 09:28.420* :  yesterday. So, the bottom line is that they're making slow marginal gains. Now, on the political
*09:28.420- 09:33.380* :  front, Ukrainian parliament has passed this bill, which bans religious organizations, I think,
*09:33.380- 09:39.200* :  with connections to Russia and, confusingly, one called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
*09:39.620- 09:46.120* :  Okay, the main target of this bill is the Russian Orthodox Church. We know that it supports the
*09:46.120- 09:54.420* :  so-called special military operation, which it calls holy war. It supports Vladimir Putin. That's
*09:54.420- 10:03.420* :  why it's branch or affiliate that used to exist in Ukraine openly and officially is seen,
*10:03.420- 10:09.920* :  well, as an agent of Russian influence. Now, this church, which slightly confusingly is called
*10:09.920- 10:14.440* :  the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, since the start of this invasion is saying, I don't know,
*10:14.440- 10:18.880* :  we've distanced ourselves from Moscow. We've got nothing to do with Moscow. The Ukrainian
*10:18.880- 10:25.940* :  government doesn't quite believe it. They say that they're still linked to Russia. That's why
*10:25.940- 10:31.140* :  this bill targets any religious organizations linked to Russia. Has there been any reaction
*10:31.140- 10:37.620* :  from Russia to this new law that being passed this bill? They are not amused. The Russian
*10:37.620- 10:43.700* :  foreign minister is spokeswoman Maria Zakharawa. She posted a statement by Gregorik Karasin, a member of
*10:43.700- 10:48.760* :  the Russian parliament's Upper House, who says that this is a shameful blow against the Ukrainian
*10:48.760- 10:54.440* :  people's historical tradition and it's part of a policy to destroy the Ukraine we loved and
*10:54.440- 11:00.340* :  thought of as a brotherly nation. Vitaly Chevchenko, there's often difficult to get a picture
*11:00.340- 11:05.160* :  of the wars that we report on. For example, access to Myanmar is denied by the authorities
*11:05.160- 11:11.080* :  the same in Gaza. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is different, but when Ukraine stages an
*11:11.080- 11:17.160* :  incursion into Russia, access is rarer. Nana Heitman is a freelance photographer from Germany,
*11:17.160- 11:22.960* :  who's worked in Russia since 2019 and has just gone on assignment for the Magnum photo agency
*11:23.460- 11:27.960* :  and has unusually gained access to Kursk, the region now under Ukrainian occupation.
*11:28.780- 11:32.800* :  Tim Franks asked her what stories she's heard from people affected by the incursion.
*11:33.480- 11:38.880* :  Mainly I met a lot of people who are extremely angry, like they are like under shock,
*11:38.880- 11:45.980* :  they are angry, like a lot of people wait thousands of people waiting in lines to to find shelter,
*11:45.980- 11:53.820* :  to find like basic needs like blankets, pillows, etc. And yeah, but like when talking more
*11:53.820- 11:59.360* :  to different people I also like encountered a lot of different voices, like sometimes people would
*11:59.860- 12:05.480* :  shout at me thinking that I'm like from the state TV and would say like go to such a that's
*12:05.480- 12:10.420* :  the city which is currently under Ukrainian control and tell us again that everything is under
*12:10.420- 12:16.100* :  control, that nothing is happening, go there and see yourself. So that was obviously pointed
*12:16.140- 12:22.920* :  towards like state media who have been presenting that the situation isn't that as bad as it's
*12:23.100- 12:28.860* :  actually. That's quite revealing in itself that people were, as you say, angry. I mean,
*12:28.860- 12:33.040* :  obviously if you're sort of suddenly displaced suddenly forced to flee your home and people are
*12:33.040- 12:39.140* :  going to be out of sorts are going to be disconcerted, but it is of course pretty rare in Russia
*12:39.220- 12:45.500* :  to hear people openly expressing their disquiet and yet you got a sense that they were prepared to
*12:45.500- 12:52.000* :  do so. Yeah, I mean like I met people who were displaced people who were feeling more like they
*12:52.040- 12:57.140* :  never achieved the state narrative confirmed that they are fighting against nature that like now
*12:57.140- 13:02.520* :  that they are under attack by the Ukrainians that this is even like why the special military so-called
*13:02.520- 13:08.320* :  special military operation is taking place and the fact that now German tanks are entering
*13:08.320- 13:13.560* :  Russian territory kind of for them confirms like the state narrative that this is a war with
*13:13.560- 13:19.140* :  NATO, but I also met a lot of other voices who were far more critical like one soldier who said
*13:19.140- 13:25.840* :  he was expecting this for a long time since it's like just strategically a really important place
*13:25.980- 13:33.680* :  curse the nuclear power plant and so on others were pointing a lot of anger also on the ministry
*13:33.680- 13:40.360* :  of defense or the local authorities accusing them while they failed to prevent the incursion how
*13:40.360- 13:47.680* :  they could not realize like troops forming up on the Russian border while others blame it on the
*13:47.680- 13:53.860* :  corruption that is happening in the ministry of defense almost all people I talk to they evacuated
*13:53.860- 13:59.740* :  on their own others who didn't have the chances to leave by car for example they are stuck now
*13:59.740- 14:05.660* :  in such a and there's no contact to their relatives and clearly all this happened you know
*14:05.660- 14:10.840* :  very very quickly the Ukrainians managed to spring this surprise and managed to make considerable
*14:10.840- 14:17.580* :  advances it did you get a sense that the authorities you know by the time you were there that they
*14:18.580- 14:22.820* :  yes they had failed to prevent the incursion but were they now responding to the sort of the
*14:22.820- 14:27.780* :  humanitarian need what did did you did you get a sense that that was being properly looked after
*14:28.020- 14:33.080* :  yeah definitely I mean there's like a lot of shelters popping up like people are distributed
*14:33.080- 14:39.120* :  all over Russia but also like we spoke like to people from NGOs for example who would say
*14:39.120- 14:44.960* :  that most people anyway they plan to stay in Kursk because still everyone has like the hope that
*14:44.960- 14:50.980* :  they can return soon back to their homes so still it's like a humanitarian catastrophe like a lot
*14:50.980- 14:56.740* :  of people arriving but there's like 120,000 people apparently who are already displaced who were
*14:56.740- 15:04.140* :  evacuated can I ask you were working I mean obviously not for state media and you were operating
*15:04.140- 15:12.160* :  independently in Russia in a very very sort of sensitive region on a very sensitive story
*15:12.160- 15:18.220* :  did you feel sort of worried at all about that side of things I mean it's like counter terrorist
*15:18.220- 15:24.540* :  regime now that means like you require special accreditation to get to Kursk or to to be
*15:24.540- 15:29.540* :  able to work in Kursk and there are a lot of controls by the police but like having that
*15:29.540- 15:35.620* :  accreditation basically permits you to move around freely in the city and you can talk without having
*15:35.620- 15:41.060* :  a mind I think everyone is nervous but like I think all journalists who are still working in Russia
*15:41.060- 15:46.520* :  we all take as many preventive measures as we can take and there's always a risk
*15:47.260- 15:53.140* :  the photojournalist Nana Heitman Africa's main public health agency says it has a plan to make 10
*15:53.140- 15:58.540* :  million inbox vaccines available for use across the continent the center of the current outbreak
*15:58.540- 16:03.720* :  is in the Democratic Republic of Congo where more than 16,000 inbox cases have been recorded
*16:03.720- 16:10.020* :  this year as well as 570 deaths the first doses are expected to arrive there next week following
*16:10.020- 16:16.260* :  donations from the US and Japan our Africa regional editor Will Ross reports the head of the
*16:16.260- 16:21.680* :  Africa Centers for Disease Control said ensuring there are 10 million inbox vaccines in Africa by
*16:21.680- 16:27.080* :  the end of the year was not just a lofty dream Jean Casseia said it was achievable thanks to an
*16:27.080- 16:31.820* :  important agreement that had been reached with the Danish company Bavarian Nordic he said it would
*16:31.820- 16:37.100* :  allow African manufacturers to use the same technology to produce the inbox doses locally
*16:37.100- 16:42.760* :  the hope is this will bring down the cost but not the quality it'll also help avoid a repeat
*16:42.760- 16:48.040* :  of the problem the continent faced during the COVID-19 pandemic when countries were relying on
*16:48.040- 16:57.260* :  handouts from wealthier nations that was Will Ross still to come they used their own intelligence
*16:57.260- 17:02.260* :  for example if they've seen a fire to coordinate and so that means each robot is running its own
*17:02.260- 17:08.280* :  intelligence and can as a result do its own search could drones operating in swarms like bees
*17:08.600- 17:10.360* :  put out wildfires around the world
*17:44.760- 17:51.580* :  this season insta cart has your back to school as in they've got your back to school lunch favorites
*17:51.580- 17:57.420* :  like snack packs and fresh fruit and they've got your back to school supplies like backpacks binders
*17:57.480- 18:04.140* :  and pencils and they've got your back when your kid casually tells you they have a huge school
*18:04.140- 18:12.180* :  project to do tomorrow let's face it we were all that kid so first call your parents to say I'm
*18:12.180- 18:18.660* :  sorry and then download the insta cart app to get delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year
*18:18.660- 18:24.620* :  long get a zero dollar delivery fee with your first three orders while supplies last minimum $10
*18:24.620- 18:34.460* :  in order additional term supply last year alone it's estimated that more than half a million
*18:34.460- 18:39.600* :  undocumented migrants made their way on foot across a stretch of jungle called the Darian Gav
*18:39.600- 18:44.780* :  from South America to Panama before trying to head north people crossing the southern border
*18:44.780- 18:49.240* :  into the United States is a key campaign issue in the upcoming US presidential election
*18:49.760- 18:54.740* :  which is why the US is paying for Panama to deport people back to their home countries rather than
*18:54.740- 18:59.600* :  allowing them to continue on to the US border the first of those flights took off on Tuesday
*19:00.340- 19:04.440* :  closing the route through the Darian Gav was also a key campaign promise of Panama's recently
*19:04.440- 19:10.540* :  elected president Jose Rao Molino our online America's editor Vanessa Bush Luter updated me on
*19:10.540- 19:16.980* :  developments the latest is that a flight took off in the early hours of this morning Panamanian time
*19:16.980- 19:22.820* :  with a group of 29 Colombians on board and what Panamanian officials have said is that these
*19:22.820- 19:28.160* :  Colombians were chosen because they had criminal records so there was a sense of urgency in
*19:28.160- 19:33.480* :  sending them back to their home country and tell us about the route that people are taking we
*19:33.480- 19:39.420* :  mentioned the Darian Gav what is it like it's a vast expanse of jungle about 100 kilometers or
*19:39.420- 19:47.140* :  60 miles wide where there are no roads so migrants who want to go from South America to Central
*19:47.140- 19:53.460* :  America and on to the United States which is of course the aim that many have their ultimate goal
*19:53.460- 20:00.680* :  they have to cross this jungle rainforest area on foot and it's a very dangerous area not just
*20:00.680- 20:07.060* :  because of the risk of landslides and of drowning in the rivers but also because criminal gangs
*20:07.060- 20:14.840* :  control many of these routes of these paths across the rainforest and they demand high payments
*20:14.860- 20:20.680* :  and there's also huge and shocking amounts of sexual violence against women in that area
*20:20.940- 20:26.080* :  and you've mentioned Colombians but it's hundreds of thousands of people where else are they coming
*20:26.080- 20:33.560* :  from apart from Colombia the biggest share currently is Venezuelans who are escaping the political
*20:33.560- 20:39.960* :  and economic crisis in their homeland and that number could of course increase massively because
*20:40.740- 20:46.660* :  there have just been elections held in Venezuela the result of that election is very disputed
*20:47.140- 20:52.240* :  the electoral council which is controlled by the government declared the incumbent president
*20:52.240- 20:58.960* :  Maduro the winner and many people had said to posters before the election that if president
*20:58.960- 21:05.800* :  Maduro were to win they would leave the country and so that stream of Venezuelan migrants could
*21:05.800- 21:11.300* :  just explode then there's also Ecuadorians who are fleeing the gang violence there
*21:11.640- 21:18.520* :  Haitians who are also fleeing the situation in their country where gang violence is also rampant
*21:19.020- 21:25.240* :  but there's also people from as far away as China and also some African countries who fly
*21:25.240- 21:31.400* :  to South America where often they don't need visas to land and then they make their way on foot
*21:31.400- 21:38.180* :  north in the hope of reaching the United States Vanessa Bush-Luta a federal court in Germany has
*21:38.180- 21:43.680* :  confirmed the conviction of a former concentration camp tightest for aiding and abetting mass murder
*21:43.680- 21:49.660* :  Jessica Parker reports from Berlin now 99 years of age Irmgard Firkner worked for the
*21:49.660- 21:57.160* :  Stutthof concentration camp commander during the last two years of World War II some 65,000 people
*21:57.740- 22:02.980* :  including Jewish prisoners poles and captured Soviet soldiers a thought to have died at the Nazi
*22:02.980- 22:09.260* :  camp which was located near the modern-day Polish city of Gdansk. Federal judges rejected arguments
*22:09.260- 22:14.980* :  from Firkner's legal team that her involvement didn't go beyond everyday neutral activities as a
*22:14.980- 22:20.820* :  typist. Their decision is final and upholds a two-year suspended sentence that was handed down
*22:20.820- 22:25.560* :  in 2022 in a case that's considered as possibly the last of its kind.
*22:25.560- 22:32.160* :  Jessica Parker a Holocaust survivor Joseph Salomonovich said that seeing justice done even after
*22:32.160- 22:40.760* :  almost 80 years was meaningful. It's incredibly important not only for today but for the future
*22:41.280- 22:46.740* :  it's incredibly important because the people who survive this will not be around for much longer.
*22:49.300- 22:53.920* :  Next to Italy and the authorities say there'll be no let up in the search for six people
*22:53.920- 22:59.580* :  missing after a luxury yacht sank off the coast of Sicily. Divers are assessing how they can get
*22:59.580- 23:04.440* :  better access into the wreck of the Bayesian. Those missing include the British tech entrepreneur
*23:04.440- 23:09.920* :  Mike Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter Hannah and four others. Fifteen other people on board were
*23:09.920- 23:15.660* :  rescued among them Mr Lynch's wife who owns the yacht. Our correspondent Mark Lowen sent this
*23:15.660- 23:24.040* :  report from Porticello in Sicily. In cloudy skies and on choppy waters the search has gone on all day
*23:24.040- 23:30.180* :  a helicopter scouring the site where the Bayesian capsized as divers plunged deep below. They're
*23:30.180- 23:35.400* :  trying to access the wreckage of the super yacht that was hit by a tornado-like water spout and is
*23:35.400- 23:41.760* :  now 150 feet underwater. Given the depth each dive can only be 10 minutes and with the boat still
*23:41.760- 23:47.220* :  largely intact it's hard to get access inside. Once they do they expect to find the bodies of
*23:47.220- 23:52.120* :  the missing. Today the British ambassador to Italy visited some of the 15 survivors who had
*23:52.120- 23:58.180* :  clambered into a life raft to be rescued. He told the BBC of the anguish he heard. It goes without
*23:58.180- 24:05.880* :  saying that you know what I've heard underlines what are desperately sad and distressing situation
*24:05.880- 24:12.140* :  they all found themselves in and find themselves in and you know my heart and all my colleagues
*24:12.140- 24:16.700* :  and I'm sure indeed the whole country goes out to them. British investigators are now here to
*24:16.700- 24:22.060* :  assess what happened during the extreme weather that hit the Bayesian. Severe heat and violent storms
*24:22.060- 24:27.260* :  had prompted a weather alert before the yacht went down and cast and borner the captain who rescued
*24:27.260- 24:34.000* :  the survivors said conditions were ripe for disaster. The water since weeks more than 30 degrees
*24:34.840- 24:41.600* :  which is way too hot for the Mediterranean and this causes for sure heavy storms.
*24:42.120- 24:48.040* :  Tonight the search goes on but any hope of a Mediterranean miracle survival has all but vanished.
*24:49.080- 24:54.180* :  Mark Lohan. Over the last year we've become used to pictures of wildfires around the world.
*24:54.460- 24:59.040* :  There have been outbreaks in countries from Greece, Italy and Spain to Tunisia and Canada.
*24:59.380- 25:04.280* :  In many cases causing human casualties as well as massive environmental and economic damage.
*25:04.940- 25:08.540* :  Scientists have warned that the wildfires have become more frequent and more widespread.
*25:09.540- 25:15.420* :  Nearly 12 million hectares globally, an area roughly the size of Nicaragua, burned in 2023.
*25:16.560- 25:20.380* :  Against this background there may be a new way to tackle these kinds of fires.
*25:20.940- 25:25.780* :  Now drones have many uses but you may not have heard of this one. Working together in swarms
*25:26.060- 25:31.680* :  to put out flames before they become wildfires. A team of firefighters, scientists and engineers
*25:31.680- 25:37.360* :  are working on a project they say will allow swarms of up to 30 autonomous planes to spot and
*25:37.360- 25:42.820* :  extinguish fires by working collectively using artificial intelligence. The research is still in
*25:42.820- 25:48.000* :  the test phase but BBC reporter Harriet Bradshaw has been to see the technology in North West England.
*25:50.400- 25:55.060* :  I've been in the fire service 28 years but we've never had the sort of major fires that we've
*25:55.060- 26:00.460* :  had recently. I'm Mark Cooxon. I work for Lancashire Rescue Team and I'm one of the drone pilots.
*26:00.900- 26:06.160* :  The one in 2018 was unprecedented. We were up on the malls four to six weeks. I've never
*26:06.160- 26:14.320* :  experienced that in my service. Wildfires. Dangerous, vicious, most often caused by human activity
*26:15.040- 26:20.760* :  and according to the National Fire Chiefs Council, more threatening than ever before in the UK
*26:20.760- 26:22.160* :  because of climate change.
*26:26.780- 26:32.700* :  But could engineering inspired by bees, birds and ants hold some answers?
*26:33.400- 26:37.460* :  So swarm engineering is all about how do you make many robots work together for real world
*26:37.460- 26:41.840* :  applications. So we can see one, two, three there. I'm Sabine Howard. I'm Professor of Swarm
*26:41.840- 26:46.940* :  Engineering at the University of Bristol. Here in Cornwall, a swarm of artificially intelligent
*26:46.940- 26:53.200* :  fire-fighting drones is being tested for the first time with the goal of detecting and stopping
*26:53.200- 26:59.420* :  wildfires. Each robot is programmed to follow rules them and so they use their own intelligence
*26:59.520- 27:03.320* :  and their own understanding of the local world of our environment, for example if they've seen a
*27:03.320- 27:08.900* :  fire to coordinate and so that means each robot is running its own intelligence and can as a result
*27:08.900- 27:16.740* :  do its own search. A small fire is lit and within minutes the drone spots it and alerts
*27:16.740- 27:22.140* :  other drones. At the moment they're just testing the swarm's ability to find fires
*27:22.680- 27:26.940* :  but the plan is for them to carry water and dampen or put them out automatically.
*27:27.540- 27:32.160* :  On days where we would expect to have a wildfire event the drones would be launched,
*27:32.160- 27:38.240* :  they would be in a scanning mode and then as soon as they identify a fire or a thermal target
*27:38.720- 27:43.120* :  fire crews can be deployed before it gets into a you know into the developed stage.
*27:44.840- 27:48.260* :  So my name is Nikolai Jellev, program manager for Windraces.
*27:48.860- 27:54.580* :  Nik, on the ground it is so much bigger than I had thought. How big is this?
*27:55.000- 28:02.280* :  This one is nine and a half meters, twin engineed 100 kilos of payload capacity and 700 liters of volume.
*28:03.140- 28:08.920* :  Crikey, and how many could we see in the air tackling wildfires than in the future?
*28:09.280- 28:16.140* :  So 20 of these can patrol about an area the size of California and one day we'd expect to have
*28:16.140- 28:23.300* :  hundreds or thousands patrolling high-risk areas around Australia, Greece and parts of Europe and
*28:23.300- 28:29.700* :  the Far East. Windraces control golf whisky in November delta Charlie. We are looking to identify
*28:29.700- 28:35.840* :  the fire for our starters but what that will enable is when you have 20 or 30 of those patrolling
*28:35.840- 28:40.260* :  the skies it would act as a deterrent for people looking to start a fire.
*28:42.000- 28:46.300* :  Outside the project it's argued this technology could be part of the answer in the future
*28:46.680- 28:51.700* :  but only part of it with a push for prevention such as landscape management solutions.
*28:52.260- 28:55.540* :  So destructive wildfires don't take hold in the first place.
*28:58.520- 29:02.940* :  Harriet Bradshaw. Now staying in Britain for leading science bodies have urged the
*29:02.940- 29:06.960* :  government to allow children to eat ice lollies as part of the school curriculum.
*29:07.640- 29:12.800* :  The idea is to focus on real-life experiences as a way of reducing inequality in core subjects.
*29:12.800- 29:18.820* :  Sean Dilly reports. It may sound a bit quirky but the report says tasting ice lollies
*29:19.060- 29:23.920* :  is a great way to teach young children science in a fun and relevant style.
*29:24.680- 29:30.600* :  Eileen Oskin is a teacher and an education policy specialist at the Royal Society of Chemistry.
*29:31.000- 29:35.960* :  They can absolutely learn that if they hold the ice lollie in their hand for too long it's
*29:35.960- 29:41.020* :  going to start to melt. We are really advocating for lots of different essential experiences.
*29:41.600- 29:46.220* :  Other suggestions for English primary schools include getting children to need dough,
*29:46.220- 29:51.600* :  visit garden centres and plant vegetables. These proposals, the authors say,
*29:51.600- 29:57.220* :  are ways to make potentially complicated topics relatable to children's everyday lives
*29:57.260- 30:01.700* :  and address academic inequalities. That report was from Sean Dilly.
*30:05.040- 30:08.580* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*30:08.580- 30:13.240* :  later on. If you'd like to comment though on the topics that we're covering do send us an email.
*30:13.240- 30:20.760* :  Our address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x at Global News Port.
*30:20.760- 30:24.620* :  This edition was mixed by Zabahal Akhorash, the producer with Liam McShephery,
*30:24.800- 30:29.080* :  the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Chris Farrow and until next time goodbye.
*30:37.280- 30:43.240* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there
*30:43.240- 30:49.800* :  was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened, not just to him,
*30:50.500- 30:55.840* :  but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
*30:56.880- 31:02.380* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
