*01:16.000- 01:19.860* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:21.880- 01:26.720* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Monday the 26th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:26.720- 01:32.320* :  The Lebanese group Hezbollah says it's completed its retaliation against Israel for the
*01:32.320- 01:38.220* :  assassination of a senior leader after a day that saw hundreds of rockets and drones fired across
*01:38.220- 01:43.940* :  the border. Telegram has condemned the arrest in France of its billionaire founder Pavel Durov
*01:44.160- 01:51.780* :  over abuses on the platform. Austin's podcast protests take place in Germany against immigration
*01:51.780- 01:57.280* :  after the authorities say a Syrian man arrested following a knife attack is suspected of
*01:57.280- 02:03.300* :  belonging to the Islamic State group. This year there have been four deaths on Western Europe's
*02:03.660- 02:08.300* :  highest mountain. Essentially Montblanc is in simple terms melted. Permafos is melted,
*02:08.820- 02:13.880* :  the glasses are melted and retreating and we are seeing more rock full, we're seeing more exposed
*02:13.880- 02:17.440* :  crevasses. So is Montblanc becoming more dangerous?
*02:21.260- 02:25.520* :  We start in the Middle East which has seen one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months
*02:25.520- 02:30.960* :  of facilities between Israel and Hezbollah. In the early hours of Sunday, Hezbollah launched
*02:30.960- 02:36.660* :  hundreds of rockets and drones. It came after the Israeli military said it had carried out a wave
*02:36.660- 02:42.740* :  of preemptive strikes in Lebanon to thwart a large-scale missile and drone attack by the group.
*02:43.360- 02:48.120* :  The long-standing leader of Hezbollah Hassan Azrallah speaking in a televised address on Sunday
*02:48.120- 02:53.900* :  evening said that a military intelligence and surveillance base close to Tel Aviv was targeted.
*02:53.900- 03:00.660* :  He said it was a delayed response to last month's assassination by Israel of a top Hezbollah commander.
*03:04.000- 03:08.200* :  We wanted to attack a target that has links with the assassination of the Hezbollah leader.
*03:08.340- 03:14.420* :  We wanted to target Israeli military intelligence or their air force because these two forces
*03:14.420- 03:19.880* :  were involved in the assassination. We also wanted this target to be deep inside Israel.
*03:19.880- 03:25.860* :  So after careful consideration, we finalized our target to be the military base in Gile lot.
*03:26.460- 03:32.240* :  Our senior international correspondent, Arla Garen, is in tie in southern Lebanon and has compiled
*03:32.240- 03:43.140* :  this report. As well as leaders, Sheikh Hassan Azrallah addressed his supporters tonight saying the
*03:43.140- 03:49.800* :  group might strike again in the future, but for now everyone could be at ease and get on with
*03:49.800- 03:56.940* :  their lives. Its attack came in the early morning, targeting military bases and barracks in
*03:56.940- 04:04.520* :  northern Israel. It said the operation was a success. Israel said most of the rockets missed their
*04:04.520- 04:12.220* :  mark. The Israeli army hit back in southern Lebanon throughout the morning, targeting Hezbollah firing
*04:12.220- 04:18.480* :  positions. It was the biggest flare-up here since the conflict began last October.
*04:19.440- 04:26.420* :  So where are we now? Hezbollah has retaliated for Israel's assassination of one of its top leaders
*04:26.420- 04:34.160* :  Fouad Shakur in Beirut last month, and Israel has carried out a major strike on its enemy.
*04:34.940- 04:40.460* :  Both sides have hit hard, but stop short of triggering all out war.
*04:41.360- 04:46.560* :  But the situation remains tense. Israel's foreign minister has said the country does not seek
*04:46.560- 04:52.700* :  a full-scale war. A correspondent Lucy Williamson has sent this report on Sunday morning's events
*04:53.140- 05:00.400* :  from Naharia in northern Israel. By the time the sirens came, northern Israel was awake.
*05:01.360- 05:07.400* :  Israeli fighter jets bombing Hezbollah launch sites, the army said. Before hundreds of drones
*05:07.400- 05:14.380* :  and rockets met Israel's air defenses overhead. The fight clearly visible from Yuval's house
*05:14.580- 05:22.340* :  six miles from the border. We felt really really large explosions. We felt like an earthquake.
*05:22.540- 05:29.120* :  The whole ground was moving like my windows were shaking. The keys in the door like everything
*05:29.120- 05:36.040* :  was shaking. So I went outside to look at it and I just saw the old skies bright orange and
*05:36.720- 05:44.400* :  there was an explosion like every three seconds. Shrapnel from an interceptor missile was caught on
*05:44.400- 05:50.380* :  camera hitting a patrol boat of the coast of Laharia, killing one officer, the army said,
*05:50.380- 05:56.880* :  and injuring two others. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah had planned a
*05:56.880- 06:04.460* :  much wider attack and that what happened today was not the final word. We are determined to do
*06:04.460- 06:08.940* :  everything to protect our country. Return the residents of the north safely to their homes
*06:09.020- 06:13.940* :  and continue to uphold a simple rule. Whoever hurts us, we hurt them.
*06:15.320- 06:21.520* :  The limited damage from this assault obscures how dangerous this moment is for months. The conflict
*06:21.520- 06:28.120* :  across this border has been widening. Now Israel has sent a hundred fighter jets to bomb Hezbollah
*06:28.120- 06:35.440* :  positions and Hezbollah rockets are flying further south, testing the trick wires for all out war.
*06:37.140- 06:42.680* :  Orgad's hotel looks out on the hills that marked the Lebanese border. He thought the
*06:42.680- 06:49.600* :  morning's assault was the start of a full-blown war. It's not a normal time so if a war should come
*06:49.600- 06:57.140* :  and finish it there are no tourists, no businessmen, no nothing. So we have to start living again.
*06:57.560- 07:02.280* :  It sounds like you want to war. If it will finish the situation as it is now yes.
*07:03.620- 07:08.940* :  This border, bristling with weapons, could pull regional and global powers into a war,
*07:09.700- 07:16.400* :  a war fueled by the conflict in Gaza that even Israel and Hezbollah say they don't want.
*07:17.320- 07:23.160* :  Lucy Williamson, there are some towns in northern Israel just across the border from Lebanon which are
*07:23.160- 07:28.860* :  largely empty and have been for some months. But what about those people who stay behind?
*07:28.860- 07:34.740* :  Shelly Barken is an English teacher in the northern Israeli town of Shlomi. She told the BBC's
*07:34.740- 07:40.820* :  own Bennett Jones what it's like when the Hezbollah rockets are fired. There are 8,000 people that live
*07:40.820- 07:46.640* :  in this little town and I think something like 200 have stayed. Most people were evacuated.
*07:46.940- 07:54.120* :  So why did you stay? Maybe I'm brave or stupid I don't know but I don't believe in running away
*07:54.120- 08:00.820* :  from my home. I have lots of animals and I'm also running a kitchen for hungry soldiers.
*08:01.640- 08:08.500* :  Also don't know where we would be better for me to go. I have elder parents nearby and it's
*08:08.500- 08:14.280* :  not easy to just give up your life, get up and move and most people that move to hotels are
*08:14.280- 08:20.860* :  very unhappy. There must be people in southern Lebanon feeling the same way? Yeah, the people wherever
*08:20.860- 08:27.900* :  was difficult for everyone. And how do you see this going? Do you think the Israeli government
*08:27.900- 08:34.900* :  will accept that your town is uninhabitable for most people or do you think the situation will
*08:36.480- 08:42.380* :  change? Well we're hoping because there are 60,000 people from the north that are not in their homes
*08:42.460- 08:48.600* :  than a high school teacher. It's almost the first of September and people want to get on with
*08:48.600- 08:54.000* :  their lives. I don't know. Whatever Israel decisions are made in Israel it's actually we have an
*08:54.000- 09:02.220* :  enemy. There's always uncertainty, always in Israel. It's so clearly affects your life, the conflict.
*09:02.220- 09:09.320* :  I mean can you see any end to it? I have lived here over 40 years and this is the worst situation
*09:09.320- 09:14.640* :  I've ever seen in Israel. I don't see an end. I don't see a solution. We don't we don't see a
*09:14.680- 09:20.240* :  solution. I don't see a solution to people coming back to the north and it's just a very depressing
*09:20.240- 09:25.220* :  situation. It's never ending. You think every day I can get worse and then you wake up in the
*09:25.220- 09:30.720* :  morning and something else happens. Shelley Barkhan living in the Israeli town of Shlomi on the
*09:30.720- 09:36.480* :  border of Lebanon. Muhammad lives on the other side of the border in a small village adjacent to
*09:36.480- 09:42.480* :  the towns that have been hit in the near daily exchange of fire since October the 8th. He sent
*09:42.480- 09:53.500* :  us a voice message about his experience of the strikes on Sunday morning. I live with my
*09:53.500- 09:59.400* :  wife and kids. We are a family of six. My wife and kids were woken up by the sound of the strikes
*10:00.180- 10:04.120* :  but being used to this they asked what's happening and I told them it is just
*10:04.120- 10:09.620* :  Israeli warplanes breaching the sound barrier so they went back to sleep. I find this to be
*10:09.620- 10:14.220* :  the best way of dealing with what we are facing and protect the mental well-being of my family
*10:14.220- 10:20.540* :  and children especially that we have no safe place to go to to hide. There are no shelters
*10:21.080- 10:25.680* :  or safe zones. All we can do is leave it to God and pray for the rest.
*10:25.680- 10:35.860* :  Muhammad from southern Lebanon. Telegram says its billionaire founder Pavel Durov is not responsible
*10:35.860- 10:42.780* :  for abuses on the platform insisting the messaging app complies with EU laws. Mr. Durov was arrested
*10:42.780- 10:48.180* :  on Saturday in Paris and is due to appear in a French court in connection with a wide range of
*10:48.180- 10:53.340* :  alleged offences linked to the platform. A correspondent will Vernon tell me more about the charges.
*10:54.160- 10:59.200* :  We're going on what the French media are saying. They quote several French law enforcement sources
*10:59.200- 11:04.940* :  who say Pavel Durov was arrested on Saturday evening at an airport near Paris. He'd arrived there
*11:05.300- 11:10.100* :  on a private jet from Azerbaijan and there was no rest warrant issued for him reportedly
*11:10.100- 11:16.260* :  in connection with telegrams failure to moderate illegal content cooperate with law enforcement
*11:16.260- 11:22.220* :  over things like drug trafficking, child sexual content and fraud. And tell us more about telegram.
*11:23.160- 11:28.020* :  Well, it's one of the most popular apps in the world, almost 1 billion users. It's
*11:28.020- 11:34.320* :  particularly popular in Russia and Ukraine. It's used by both sides in the war, both by pro-Cremlin,
*11:34.320- 11:40.620* :  state media and military bloggers, but also by Ukrainian officials, including President Zelensky
*11:40.960- 11:45.400* :  and ordinary Ukrainians who want to keep up with the course of the war, fundraise, support the
*11:45.400- 11:51.820* :  troops. The reason it's controversial is because there's very little moderation. So when harmful
*11:51.820- 11:57.140* :  illegal content is posted on telegram, it rarely gets taken down by the app. They have a pretty
*11:57.140- 12:03.120* :  small team of moderators compared to other social media companies, according to experts. Western
*12:03.120- 12:08.320* :  law enforcement is becoming increasingly concerned about things like drug trafficking, terrorism,
*12:09.000- 12:14.160* :  pedophilia. One German security official said that telegram was a medium for radicalization.
*12:15.180- 12:20.560* :  And what about reaction to his arrest with had Elon Musk react and of course Russian officials too?
*12:21.160- 12:23.520* :  Yeah, that's interesting about the Russian officials, isn't it? Because, of course,
*12:23.520- 12:29.080* :  Pavel Dordov is no friend of the Kremlin. He fled Russia in 2014 after having quite a public
*12:29.580- 12:34.380* :  falling out after, according to him, the Russian security services tried to seize control of his
*12:34.380- 12:40.360* :  previous project, VK, which was the Russian version of Facebook. But despite that, Russian officials,
*12:40.360- 12:44.400* :  including the spokeswoman from the Russian Foreign Ministry, have been out today saying that
*12:44.400- 12:49.620* :  Pavel Dordov is a political prisoner. And several officials have been on state TV saying that
*12:49.620- 12:54.540* :  this shows the West's double standards in terms of freedom of speech and democracy. And
*12:54.540- 12:59.900* :  most people will listen to that and think it's quite absurd for Russian officials to lecture anyone
*12:59.900- 13:06.140* :  about internet freedoms when we consider that Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, the BBC,
*13:06.140- 13:10.400* :  all mainstream independent Russian media are blocked in Russia.
*13:11.060- 13:17.620* :  Well Vernon, the first batch of MPOX vaccines are set to finally reach Africa in the coming days,
*13:17.620- 13:22.660* :  weeks after they were made available in other parts of the world. A new deadly strain has been
*13:22.660- 13:27.620* :  spreading rapidly across the region with the largest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*13:27.940- 13:34.120* :  10,000 doses have been delivered this week, a long way off the 10 million needed, according to Africa's
*13:34.120- 13:39.180* :  Center for Disease Control. I heard more from our Africa Regional Editor, Richard Kugoy.
*13:39.920- 13:45.140* :  The new strain is called CLID-1B. It's highly transmissible, detected faster in
*13:45.140- 13:50.880* :  eastern DRC in September last year, where the disease is endemic and has since spread
*13:51.260- 13:58.180* :  beyond DRC to the rest of East Africa and parts of West Africa. According to the Africa Center
*13:58.180- 14:04.780* :  for Disease Control and Prevention, we have about 18,000 cases that have been confirmed so far
*14:05.160- 14:11.880* :  and more than 500 people have died as a result of infection. So what we are seeing right now is that
*14:11.880- 14:16.760* :  there's a lot of surveillance across the different parts of the continent. There's increase
*14:17.460- 14:23.100* :  diagnoses and critical of awareness, especially just among the general population, just to be aware
*14:23.100- 14:32.020* :  about this outbreak. And yet the first batch of vaccines are only set to reach Africa in the coming
*14:32.020- 14:37.860* :  days. Why has there been such a delay? You know, African countries or low-income countries cannot
*14:37.980- 14:42.980* :  procure some of these vaccines directly, so they have to go through drug manufacturers.
*14:43.660- 14:47.160* :  And so that's really been the challenge. And of course, you'd also have the World Health
*14:47.160- 14:53.920* :  Organization that needs to give or grant these emergency approvals. So what we saw is that in 2022,
*14:53.920- 15:00.320* :  when we had an outbreak in North America and parts of Europe, those deployment of some of these
*15:00.320- 15:05.180* :  vaccines, but that has not been shared, you know, equitably to the rest of the continent. So what
*15:05.480- 15:10.840* :  African countries have been doing is just reaching out to countries that had been previously affected
*15:11.680- 15:17.180* :  requesting for donations. So so far, we've seen countries like the US and Japan indicating that
*15:17.180- 15:22.260* :  they will be donating, you know, thousands of vaccines. But basically the continent at the moment
*15:22.260- 15:27.720* :  to deal with this outbreak needs about 10 million doses. So sort of like a drop in the ocean.
*15:28.480- 15:34.580* :  So is there a sense of anger perhaps among the health authorities that Africa is once again
*15:34.580- 15:39.440* :  being left behind the rest of the world? Absolutely. I was just listening to one expert
*15:39.440- 15:44.880* :  from South Africa and how the continent also still lags behind, you know, having been through
*15:44.880- 15:50.280* :  the COVID pandemic. According to this is quite outrageous. There has been that expression.
*15:50.580- 15:56.240* :  So it feels like the continent is largely being not given the prominence of the attention that it
*15:56.240- 16:01.820* :  is are. So sort of like the western part of the world, it seems to be selfish or, you know,
*16:01.820- 16:07.860* :  looking after itself and just Africa being left on its own to deal with this. So there's a sense
*16:07.860- 16:14.120* :  of not being treated fairly and, you know, there's no equity when it comes especially to dealing
*16:14.140- 16:25.100* :  with public health emergencies. Richard Cugoy. Still to come. He probably is the most legendary figure
*16:25.100- 16:31.440* :  in baseball. The best player on the best and still the most story team the New York Yankees.
*16:31.840- 16:36.640* :  And his baseball jersey sells for $24 million at auction.

*18:00.100- 18:05.500* :  The issue of immigration has resurfaced in Germany following Friday's fatal knife attack
*18:05.500- 18:10.620* :  at a street festival in the city of Zollingen. Three people were killed and eight others were injured.
*18:10.620- 18:15.920* :  The German authorities say they believe the man they've arrested as Syrian national is a member
*18:15.920- 18:21.340* :  of the Islamic State Group. While Zollingen's residents lined the streets with flowers and candles,
*18:21.380- 18:30.340* :  the youth wing of the far-right AFD party staged a protest. Zollingen's representative in the
*18:30.340- 18:33.780* :  Bundestag the STP's Ingo Schaefer has called for unity.
*18:37.420- 18:43.040* :  We will not allow ourselves to be divided. We will not allow the extremist parties to make this
*18:43.040- 18:48.780* :  their own. This is an awful catastrophe. My pill would be to let us in Zollingen finish our
*18:48.940- 18:54.040* :  morning and allow us time to remember the deceased. In an online statement, Friedrich
*18:54.040- 18:58.920* :  Beres, Germany's opposition leader, said enough is enough, declaring the country should stop
*18:58.920- 19:05.080* :  admitting further refugees from Syria and Afghanistan. Freelance journalist Talit Koch used
*19:05.080- 19:11.440* :  to work as a communications adviser for Mr. Merz's party, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union.
*19:12.180- 19:16.600* :  Friedrich Merz, the chairman of the CDU, offered to a Bundeskanzel Scholz to the Chancellor,
*19:16.600- 19:23.100* :  who's going to arrive in Zollingen tomorrow to speak to Thames and he offered a cross-party
*19:23.100- 19:31.260* :  effort to finally get some decisions and implement policies to improve the situation.
*19:31.720- 19:37.220* :  The thing is, what you have to understand about that, the perpetrator, he entered the EU via Bulgaria
*19:37.900- 19:42.900* :  and it would have been absolutely within all EU regulations to send him back to Bulgaria,
*19:43.720- 19:49.300* :  but the German administration didn't manage to, they tried to detain him once, didn't manage,
*19:49.300- 19:54.780* :  and then a deadline passed and he was entitled to stay in Germany unless he would have been
*19:54.780- 20:02.480* :  sent to Syria. Because in the coalition, we do not deport, not even criminals to Syria,
*20:03.160- 20:11.180* :  so it's not so much the CDU is changing policy, it is that nothing has basically been done
*20:11.700- 20:18.480* :  law-wise legally to modernise the German asylum system and the immigration system to cope
*20:19.220- 20:26.000* :  with a still increasing number of irregular immigrants and sometimes with results as we've seen
*20:26.000- 20:35.420* :  on Friday in Zollingen. Tannit Koch. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, more than 400
*20:35.420- 20:40.460* :  museums, churches and monuments have been destroyed or damaged during the conflict,
*20:40.460- 20:46.800* :  but despite the loss of so many buildings and so much devastation, interest in Ukrainian culture
*20:47.100- 20:49.700* :  is booming as Vitaly Shchefchenko reports.
*20:55.620- 21:02.140* :  That's Stefania, a song by the Ukrainian band, Carlos Orchestra. Its victory in the 2022 Eurovision
*21:02.140- 21:07.600* :  contest is symbolic of the surge in interest in Ukrainian culture after the start of the Russian
*21:07.600- 21:13.320* :  invasion. This interest comes at a heavy, bloody price. Hundreds of cultural sites in Ukraine
*21:13.320- 21:18.720* :  have been damaged or destroyed. Among them is the Museum of the 18th Century Philosopher
*21:18.940- 21:23.880* :  a Haryhoriy Skvorodar in Kharkiv region. Here's its deputy director, Nastya Ishchenko.
*21:34.380- 21:38.480* :  In areas occupied by Russia, Ukrainian museums are facing another problem,
*21:38.480- 21:44.240* :  plunder. For instance, in the final days of the occupation of Kherson, whole truckloads of
*21:44.240- 21:50.280* :  artworks and historical artifacts were taken by Russians. In all, more than 400 cultural sites in
*21:50.280- 21:56.540* :  Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war in 2022. They include churches,
*21:56.540- 22:03.100* :  culturally significant buildings, museums, monuments and libraries. Ukraine's acting culture
*22:03.100- 22:08.760* :  minister, Rostislav Karandeyev, believes that Russia is deliberately targeting Ukrainian culture
*22:08.760- 22:21.120* :  and heritage. The spiritual and historical components are key, and that's why Russia's
*22:21.220- 22:27.420* :  attacked not just militarily targets in critical infrastructure, but also anything that allows
*22:27.420- 22:33.880* :  Ukrainians to speak of their own identity and statehood. But this destruction has also sparked
*22:33.880- 22:40.160* :  a hunger for Ukrainian culture. One Ukrainian newspaper then even speaks of a Ukrainian cultural
*22:40.160- 22:47.020* :  boom generating your acts and performers. Damage to Ukraine's art and heritage goes deeper than
*22:47.020- 22:52.260* :  just bricks and mortar. But culture also helps heal the wounds caused by war.
*22:53.040- 22:59.280* :  Vitaly Shchefchenko. Mokblonk is the highest mountain in Western Europe and attracts adventurous
*22:59.280- 23:05.540* :  tourists. During the winter most ski down and in summer climb up, but this year there have been
*23:05.540- 23:11.500* :  four deaths on Mokblonk in less than a week. So why are so many people losing their lives?
*23:12.380- 23:18.160* :  Owen Bennett Jones spoke to Kenton Kuhl, who's climbed Mount Everest 18 times and is a mountain
*23:18.160- 23:24.860* :  guide in the Alps. Many of the mountains across the Alps not just Mokblonk are suffering from global
*23:24.860- 23:32.220* :  warming. We are experiencing summer upon summer ever increasing temperatures. So the
*23:32.220- 23:38.100* :  zero isotherm a couple of weeks ago was above 5,000 meters. There's above the summit of Mokblonk.
*23:38.100- 23:45.140* :  So essentially Mokblonk is in simple terms melted. And what this means is the permafrost is
*23:45.160- 23:50.660* :  melting. The glasses are melting and retreating. And we are seeing more rockfall. We're seeing more
*23:50.660- 23:56.180* :  exposed crevasses. And the way that we as mountain guides have to approach these mountains are
*23:56.180- 24:00.380* :  changing. But not everybody in the general public understands that.
*24:00.520- 24:05.180* :  Yeah, I mean if you go to the the French Alps it really is unmistakable isn't it? Each year the
*24:05.180- 24:11.860* :  snow goes what 50 feet higher at the mountain or more than that. Glacier retreat is beyond shocking.
*24:11.900- 24:18.740* :  It is accelerating year upon year. It brings different dangers that we weren't experienced in
*24:19.500- 24:26.600* :  10, 15 years ago. And we have to change our approaches to do things. We climb less or snow and
*24:26.600- 24:30.340* :  ice these days and more on rocky ridges. And that brings its own dangers.
*24:30.760- 24:36.240* :  Mount Blonk looks quite easy. It looks easier than it is anyway. And it must be partly that there
*24:36.240- 24:39.320* :  are just so many people who actually just don't really know what they're doing.
*24:39.440- 24:44.260* :  Where there is that and we get that with all honeypot mountains to a certain extent. And these
*24:44.260- 24:49.880* :  mountains do attract people because they are iconic. Obviously, Mon Blonk, high speaking,
*24:49.880- 24:56.080* :  Western Europe. And it is comparatively easy to climb if you have a modicum of common sense
*24:56.080- 25:02.340* :  and an experience. And not everybody has a depth of experience. And avoidable accidents happen
*25:02.340- 25:06.900* :  on these mountains all the time. What sort of mistakes do you see them make? I was climbing the
*25:06.900- 25:12.040* :  mountain only last Thursday. There were actually lovely people climbing the mountain. They had no
*25:12.040- 25:17.060* :  rope. When they reached almost the top of the mountain hall where they both managed to lose a cramp
*25:17.060- 25:23.740* :  on. I mean, how? I will never quite fully understand. They were there teaching around on snow and
*25:23.740- 25:30.840* :  ice without crampons on without a rope. Not only are they in danger, but they are in danger in
*25:31.220- 25:35.660* :  other groups on the mountain as well because if they were to slip off and fall and hit a guided
*25:35.660- 25:40.160* :  party, chances are they are going to kill the guided party as well. These are the sources
*25:40.160- 25:44.640* :  of things that we are constantly seeing. People that don't have the experience are going up in
*25:44.640- 25:51.740* :  bad weather, going up past ill-equipped, going up to late in the day. There is a whole catalogue
*25:51.740- 25:57.720* :  of mistakes that are being made by inexperienced climbers. You have been doing this for how long
*25:57.720- 26:03.840* :  this guiding? I have been guiding the European out for 20 years or so and been guiding in the Himalayas
*26:03.840- 26:11.260* :  for about 25 years. What is your greatest pleasure in doing this? My U.S.P is climbing
*26:11.260- 26:16.840* :  Everest. I have climbed Everest 18 times. When you get to the summit of a peak like Everest or
*26:16.840- 26:22.640* :  the Matterhorn to see the joy and wonderment in your client and to help your client,
*26:23.580- 26:27.000* :  climb to the summit or something which perhaps they wouldn't be able to achieve without
*26:27.000- 26:32.720* :  your help is something very, very special. For me, it is a bit of a dream job to be in the
*26:32.980- 26:38.140* :  Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, or wherever it may be. Kent and Kool, expert, mountain climber,
*26:38.560- 26:43.940* :  and guide. Over the weekend, the Notting Hill Carnival has been taking place here in London
*26:43.940- 26:49.780* :  for the 56th year, more than two million people are expected to attend the three-day event.
*26:49.780- 26:55.580* :  The three-mile long parade that takes place celebrates Caribbean culture, a mix of calypso,
*26:55.580- 27:00.320* :  steel bands and sound systems. But if you have ever seen pictures from Carnival,
*27:00.320- 27:06.580* :  it's the array of colorful costumes that catch the eye. For more than 50 years, a group of artists
*27:06.580- 27:11.100* :  and families in the Halston District of London have been designing Carnival clothing,
*27:11.100- 27:20.800* :  and our reporter Aminate Kamara has been to meet them. Wow, this is amazing. I need the music now.
*27:23.660- 27:30.280* :  That's a magic of Carnival. Every single one of these costumes comes with a story and a
*27:30.280- 27:35.500* :  message and a heritage that goes on to tell the story of a time or a moment or a person.
*27:36.580- 27:41.600* :  My name is Clary, and you're at Mahogany Carnival, and we've been here for a very long time,
*27:41.600- 27:48.360* :  and you're in the heart of Halston. Mahogany is a family of families who love and make Carnival
*27:48.360- 27:53.680* :  for the whole community, and we've been doing it for a very, very long time. So we have a style
*27:53.680- 27:59.120* :  and we are embedded in our community here in Halston. So we do things for Diwali and Eden,
*27:59.120- 28:05.440* :  other things as well. So we are a world company encompassing all the different members of our
*28:05.440- 28:13.060* :  community. This year's theme is called Diaspora, and it's a cry for peace. A diaspora, you know,
*28:13.060- 28:17.340* :  you've come from your origin, and you've moved to somewhere else and you've taken your culture
*28:17.340- 28:23.160* :  with you, and that becomes your home. And the Carnival then is very much a part of the African
*28:23.160- 28:30.840* :  Diaspora, Caribbean Diaspora here in the UK. Hello, do you remember your name and what you're doing?
*28:30.980- 28:34.640* :  It's the Hubeon Hubeon Condor. All of the structures that you've seen
*28:34.700- 28:38.720* :  together with all the fabrics and the colours and everything. They're attached to the bodies
*28:38.720- 28:43.100* :  somehow, and that attachment is basically what I'm working on at the moment. It's very much about
*28:43.100- 28:48.080* :  that freedom, that celebration of the participation of slavery, and it's an opportunity where we can
*28:48.080- 28:56.440* :  take the streets, we run the streets for the day. My name is Latisha. I am here obviously designing
*28:56.620- 29:03.960* :  the costume exodus. I've created all these faces, drawn them, painted them. All of these drawings
*29:03.960- 29:12.560* :  represent somebody from the Windrash World War. My name is Trinity. My name is Nayara. How many
*29:12.560- 29:18.060* :  costumes are you actually making? It's a lot like maybe a 160. What tends to be your favourite part
*29:18.060- 29:23.000* :  of the whole process? When the costumes are on the rail and you see like there's a part of Carnival
*29:23.020- 29:27.260* :  where there's a big hill and you can see all the costumes and all the colours. I like when you see
*29:27.260- 29:32.160* :  like the little kids happy sitting in costume and just the smiles on their faces makes just like
*29:32.660- 29:39.560* :  you feel like you've done something good. How do you think it's kind of stayed so consistent and
*29:39.560- 29:46.160* :  been one of the rich pillars of Carnival for all these years? What I think that Carnival is a force,
*29:47.240- 29:53.220* :  it's our right, it's our culture, and it is really relevant, relevant to the community,
*29:53.220- 29:59.320* :  relevant to the political situation, relevant to the world situation. I think that is part of the
*29:59.360- 30:02.960* :  power that really very much is a language, official language.
*30:09.060- 30:14.100* :  And finally, a jersey worn by the man considered to be the best baseball player ever,
*30:14.100- 30:20.900* :  Babe Ruth, has been sold for $24 million. It makes it the most expensive item of sporting
*30:20.900- 30:26.800* :  memorabilia ever to sell it auction. The New York Yankees player won the World Series seven times
*30:26.800- 30:33.760* :  and wore the jersey during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. That's more than 90 years
*30:33.760- 30:40.820* :  ago. So why does Babe Ruth remain such a big name in baseball now? Will Shaken covers baseball and
*30:40.820- 30:49.380* :  sports business for the LA Times? He probably is the most legendary figure in baseball. He was the
*30:49.380- 30:56.680* :  predominant personality during the first half of the 20th century. At a time that baseball was really,
*30:56.680- 31:03.460* :  the national sport and the only major sport in the United States. And he was the best player on the
*31:03.460- 31:09.840* :  best and still the most story team, the New York Yankees. The major distinction that Babe Ruth had,
*31:09.840- 31:16.740* :  and I want to, I guess, separate this into two. One is he started hitting home runs at a rate nobody
*31:16.740- 31:22.620* :  else had ever seen. His records for home runs stood for decades. All of a sudden you could go to
*31:22.620- 31:29.000* :  the baseball game and see a guy hit the ball all the way out of the stadium. The other distinction
*31:29.000- 31:37.320* :  was that although generally in baseball you are either a hitter or a pitcher, he did both and he
*31:37.320- 31:43.120* :  did both pretty well. But after two years of doing both, he said, you know, I'm a pretty good
*31:43.120- 31:49.940* :  hitter. I'm going to stick with that. And nobody has ever done that until now. If you watch Major League
*31:49.940- 31:56.600* :  Baseball, you see Shohei Otani from Japan and now playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He hits
*31:56.600- 32:02.940* :  and he pitches. He does both and in elite level. He's done it for longer than Babe Ruth ever did.
*32:03.040- 32:08.360* :  So now we have the question of for all the people that have saying Babe Ruth delivered unprecedented
*32:08.360- 32:14.980* :  performances. He did in his day, but Shohei has done close to everything Babe Ruth has done.
*32:14.980- 32:18.880* :  And of course, he's still in the middle of his career. Bill shaken.

*32:54.820- 32:59.640* :  We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*32:59.660- 33:05.820* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*33:05.900- 33:13.360* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
