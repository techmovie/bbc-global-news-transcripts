*01:38.860- 01:43.120* :  I'm Valerie Sarderson, and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 10th of August,
*01:43.120- 01:48.440* :  they're just amazing. They have tons and tons of personality, and it makes me really happy
*01:48.440- 01:53.240* :  that we can offer some bit of hope, some inspiration for the world to have a little brightness in
*01:53.240- 01:59.060* :  their day. We hear about the cheeky habits and conservation role of the first panda pair set
*01:59.060- 02:04.340* :  to the US for more than 20 years. We meet the woman who defined tradition to open the first
*02:04.360- 02:11.580* :  old female cafe in southern Iraq. A dream, big dream, make it happen, and you will find the
*02:11.580- 02:17.280* :  supports. Make your dream happen also if you don't have any supports, because you must support
*02:17.280- 02:23.800* :  yourself. Plus, this was extra ordinary. It was something that most people didn't expect. They
*02:23.800- 02:29.620* :  wanted to go there and bring happiness to these people. Botswana celebrates sprint victory at the
*02:29.620- 02:35.480* :  Olympics with a party and time off work. Also in this podcast, our reporter in the Netherlands
*02:35.480- 02:40.360* :  surrenders her smartphone reluctantly and meets people at the offline club.
*02:40.940- 02:46.720* :  I really believe that it's important to take some time off of my screen. I think a lot of us are
*02:46.720- 02:53.300* :  craving authentic connections with people. And the parrot with a record-breaking memory.
*03:04.780- 03:10.240* :  We start with an adorable duo that have just made their public debut at San Diego Zoo.
*03:10.760- 03:15.840* :  The giant pandas have been settled in after arriving from China. The first of the bears sent
*03:15.840- 03:22.580* :  to the United States for 21 years. It's hopes in bow and Yoon Chuan will help global conservation
*03:22.580- 03:29.120* :  efforts. The happy pods Holly Gibbs spoke to Marco Went, a wildlife ambassador at the San Diego Zoo
*03:29.120- 03:37.640* :  Alliance. So what are this fantastic pair like? We have a five-year-old male. His name is Yoon Chuan.
*03:37.640- 03:43.220* :  Now he, by the way, super relaxed panda. His favorite thing to do is eat and sleep. So
*03:43.540- 03:48.660* :  I was told he likes to be slow to wake up in the morning and to rise, which I completely
*03:48.660- 03:54.700* :  identify with. He loves to munch in his bamboo and take that very prioritized midday nap and then go
*03:54.700- 04:02.060* :  back to bamboo again. So very laid back male panda. And we also have sing bow. Sing bow is our
*04:02.060- 04:08.140* :  four-year-old female. Very different than Yoon Chuan. She is a very curious panda and a playful
*04:08.140- 04:13.740* :  panda to boot. So we can't wait to open up our conservation doors and welcome the public to come
*04:13.740- 04:18.720* :  get to know are these two beautiful vibrant pandas. Gosh, I think I relate to a slow morning and
*04:18.720- 04:25.060* :  wanting a midday nap. Do they have any cheeky habits? If Yoon Chuan happens to see his
*04:25.060- 04:30.300* :  diet arriving near his habitat and he doesn't see the wildlife care specialist get to the food
*04:30.300- 04:35.100* :  right away. He'll make a small little sound just to let them know like, hey, I see the food and
*04:35.100- 04:40.220* :  you know what? I would really like to have it now, but I think it's adorable. Also for sing bow,
*04:40.220- 04:46.380* :  she's been known to not only explore her habitat, but also solicit play from her panda buddies out
*04:46.380- 04:50.980* :  in China in the past. So I just think they're just amazing and they have tons and tons of
*04:50.980- 04:55.900* :  personality. And how have they been settling in? They have their own special new enclosure. Exactly
*04:55.900- 05:00.580* :  right. We want to make sure it highlights their natural tendencies or natural ecosystems.
*05:00.700- 05:07.080* :  So when guests enter our panda ridge habitat, they will be immersed in that beautiful
*05:07.080- 05:13.260* :  southwestern area of China. The other day, I was just watching Yoon Chuan splashing around in
*05:13.260- 05:18.000* :  this pool and it was really funny to me because he would run to his pool, flop that fuzzy butt
*05:18.000- 05:22.540* :  right into the water and then hop back out and go to his bamboo, munching some bamboo and
*05:22.540- 05:26.020* :  get right back to the water again. So I think they're really enjoying this fresh,
*05:26.020- 05:30.320* :  sandy, eagle lifestyle. And why do you think the pandas are so popular? I've been talking about this
*05:30.320- 05:34.760* :  a lot, you know, you know, at times I've noticed it's hard sometimes for the public or human beings to
*05:34.760- 05:39.700* :  connect with an animal that's not a mammal. There's certain attributes of mammals that we can respond to.
*05:39.980- 05:45.620* :  And especially when you think of the word neoteny. So by that, I mean an adult creature animal
*05:45.620- 05:50.380* :  human being showcasing more juvenile features. So in this case, it would be the large ears,
*05:50.380- 05:55.560* :  the big eyes. And I think that's what really gravitates towards people. They want to protect it.
*05:55.560- 06:00.840* :  Wildlife communicates. We just have to learn how to listen. On a serious note, how will having
*06:00.840- 06:06.780* :  these pandas in San Diego Zoo help with global conservation efforts? What is getting me most
*06:06.780- 06:11.780* :  excited, I've been doing this for about 28 years, started the zoo when I was 16. The amount
*06:11.780- 06:17.920* :  support and the passion is really inspiring for me that the world is getting united for wildlife
*06:17.920- 06:22.800* :  and it makes me really happy that we can offer some bit of hope, some inspiration for the world
*06:22.800- 06:27.380* :  that have a little, little brightness in their day. Are you hoping that the pandas might breed
*06:27.380- 06:33.500* :  and you can have a family of pandas? I mean, who doesn't want to see a baby panda? But yes,
*06:33.660- 06:38.440* :  a breeding is part of the idea and the hope and the aspirations that we have. And their public debut
*06:38.440- 06:43.660* :  is on the 8th of the 8th month, which is the day that I'm speaking to you. Was that intentional?
*06:43.660- 06:48.080* :  Because I know that 8 is quite a lucky number to some people in China. You know, I haven't
*06:48.080- 06:51.360* :  heard any of that, but that's good to know as well. I mean, it feels pretty lucky to me and I
*06:51.360- 06:56.200* :  can say it is a beautiful day and it feels right. I feel it's a very appropriate number, I think.
*06:56.200- 07:03.120* :  What I am most excited about is to see the faces of children see a giant panda. I get to communicate
*07:03.120- 07:08.020* :  with a variety of different children from all over the world. But for me, it doesn't matter if you're
*07:08.020- 07:13.960* :  the emperor of the world or a kid from the Babrio. This is going to be for everyone. I want
*07:13.960- 07:19.160* :  the public to understand that they are part of all of this. I see people every day coming here and
*07:19.160- 07:22.460* :  getting emotional. I'm getting emotional. I'm not even thinking about it. Just seeing them get
*07:22.460- 07:27.620* :  connected to wildlife from all over the world. The opportunities that people have to thrive and
*07:27.620- 07:33.400* :  to experience this and to unite makes it an important scenario. It's why we do what we do. We want
*07:33.400- 07:40.340* :  people to rally and to make that positive change in the world. Marco went from the San Diego Zoo Alliance.
*07:40.380- 07:45.200* :  The president of Botswana gave everyone in the country the afternoon off work on Friday,
*07:45.200- 07:50.480* :  so they could celebrate a remarkable achievement. The country's first gold medal at the Olympics.
*07:51.120- 07:56.480* :  Super sprinter Let's Lead the Bohus win in the men's 200 meters on Thursday was a moment to cherish
*07:56.480- 08:01.460* :  for the entire nation. But he also made history for all of Africa as the first runner from the
*08:01.460- 08:07.620* :  continent to win the Olympic men's 200 title. He dedicated his victory to his mother who died in May.
*08:08.440- 08:12.760* :  It means a lot to me. It means a lot to African continent. It means a lot to everybody who was
*08:12.760- 08:17.520* :  rallying behind me. And for the team that was behind me when we heard about my mom's passing,
*08:18.040- 08:23.680* :  I was grateful for them because personally I thought my career was over but the team they made
*08:23.680- 08:28.060* :  sure I take each and every day how it comes and make sure that I will come here with a healthier
*08:28.060- 08:34.360* :  body and a healthier mind. People across Botswana celebrated on Thursday night with dancing and music.
*08:39.660- 08:45.600* :  The Botswana Athletics Journalist Kalista Kalanzo spoke to Isaac Fanon the morning after the race.
*08:46.400- 08:52.660* :  I think I slept half the night after I had been in Shia's entire day waiting for that race.
*08:52.660- 09:00.400* :  I mean what a performance by Sabahoye. Where did this come from do you think? Look this was
*09:01.260- 09:07.160* :  something extraordinary. It was something that most people didn't expect it to go the way
*09:07.160- 09:15.220* :  it went but to him has an emotional race. He was doing this for his mother. He has always been
*09:15.220- 09:21.360* :  saying that he wished his mother was there with him during the final or at the entire Olympics.
*09:21.360- 09:25.980* :  They wanted to go there and bring happiness to his people by coming Botswana.
*09:26.400- 09:33.080* :  His mother has obviously been a huge part of his life. For him, how has the reaction been
*09:33.080- 09:37.680* :  like him in Botswana? I know the president has just announced some good news for you. You won't
*09:37.680- 09:43.640* :  be working this afternoon. Is that correct? We wouldn't be working this afternoon. The nation has
*09:43.640- 09:49.020* :  been celebrating since last night. People have been dancing in the streets. People have been
*09:49.020- 09:55.260* :  fighting all night. The celebrations are going to continue until this arrival that is planned
*09:55.260- 10:02.220* :  for next week. We expect the celebrations to spread across the country, expecting to go on that
*10:02.220- 10:08.140* :  tour of the country, showing off that the world medal. This is so big. It's something that
*10:08.860- 10:14.580* :  a lot of pain has gone into for many years. It's something that there's been an intentional
*10:14.620- 10:20.220* :  program that we wanted to show out there. We wanted to show the world that Botswana has always
*10:20.220- 10:26.020* :  been known as a 400-meter country. But we wanted to come out with something special and the best
*10:26.020- 10:31.740* :  way that something special will happen has been through. It's like the war. He has been
*10:31.740- 10:38.700* :  dominating since his days as an under 20, up to now, as a senior athlete. So we can only expect
*10:38.700- 10:44.520* :  the best from him and not only for himself, but also as an inspiration to other young athletes
*10:44.520- 10:51.800* :  that are coming up in this country and the continent has always been something that
*10:52.140- 10:58.340* :  there was for them to Africa. We were always been known for long distance, but now here we are,
*10:58.740- 11:03.940* :  we have joined this printing world and we are not living anything to chance. We are going for
*11:03.940- 11:10.500* :  everything that's out there. Khaleestas Colanzo. Follow your dreams if you have support and follow
*11:10.500- 11:15.120* :  them if you don't. The words of one young woman in Iraq who defined tradition to open a
*11:15.120- 11:20.960* :  cafe by herself with the hope of creating a safe space for women. Joan Jamil opened Joan's
*11:20.960- 11:25.680* :  Cafe in the southern city of Basra earlier this year, sprowed on by a mission to succeed
*11:25.680- 11:29.320* :  and a love of coffee. Stephanie Prentice has been speaking to her.
*11:36.980- 11:43.340* :  It's morning in southern Iraq and a cozy cafe in Basra is making coffee for the pre-work rush,
*11:43.740- 11:52.000* :  all seen in a slick Instagram video. Here vintage tea cups from England are on display in an
*11:52.000- 11:58.960* :  old wooden cabinet, designer-like bulbs, dangle from the ceiling and delicate glazed pastries line
*11:58.960- 12:06.560* :  the counter. But things weren't always so sweet for the cafe's owner, Joan Jamil. Her dream of a
*12:06.560- 12:12.960* :  safe space for women to meet didn't come easily in a city dominated by cafes for young men and
*12:12.960- 12:20.300* :  she should culture. Cafe she says women don't feel comfortable walking into let alone attempting to
*12:20.300- 12:28.380* :  open as a business. It's good good vibes but not comfortable for women because of our culture
*12:29.420- 12:36.280* :  and the south of Iraq there is a traditional culture and the middle of Iraq and Baghdad or north
*12:36.280- 12:43.820* :  of Iraq. No, it's very normal if any girl or want to open coffee. It's normal but in the south,
*12:43.820- 12:50.740* :  no, I'm the first one in the in the south area, not just Basra. Despite the traditional views all
*12:50.740- 12:57.620* :  around her, Joan was determined and went to speak to her family about her idea. It's very very
*12:57.620- 13:06.180* :  very difficult from my parents, from my dad but one person support me, it's my sister. She told me
*13:06.620- 13:13.520* :  go for it and let's see what's happened. When I open it and I challenge myself, challenge my family,
*13:13.520- 13:20.400* :  challenge my dad, challenge my community, old old community. After that, after when they come and see
*13:20.400- 13:28.040* :  my cafe, it's simple and there's good vibes and old vintage vibes. It's something new on
*13:28.040- 13:36.200* :  on south of Iraq. So they support me. Now the comfy space is busy day and night. The cookies,
*13:36.200- 13:43.000* :  cakes and sweets are all sorts from businesses run by women in the area and on Instagram, Joan has
*13:43.000- 13:47.960* :  more than 10,000 followers watching her daily stories about her new life.
*13:50.780- 13:57.100* :  On the ground, she says women treat the cafe like a second home and now she wants a second
*13:57.100- 14:04.980* :  second home. I like to open in Nasri also south of Iraq and there is no cafe, no woman there.
*14:06.560- 14:13.580* :  A dream, a big dream, so big and make it happen. Make it happen and you will find the supports
*14:14.420- 14:21.320* :  and make it happen, make your dream happen. Also, if you don't have any supports because you
*14:21.320- 14:27.420* :  must support yourself. Joan Jamil ending that report from Stephanie Prentice and you can find Joan
*14:27.420- 14:34.420* :  on Instagram at jones.cafe. Last week we asked you to tell us about a time someone had been
*14:34.420- 14:40.000* :  kind to you and we received this story from Shannon in Vancouver Island about meeting a kind
*14:40.000- 14:48.040* :  stranger while traveling around Ireland. About 20 years ago, I was in my very early 20s and was
*14:48.040- 14:53.740* :  traveling all by myself for the first time. While I was there, I relied a lot on the kindness of
*14:53.740- 14:59.300* :  strangers. I was there for about three and a half months and by the time it was the time for my
*14:59.300- 15:04.520* :  flight home, I was definitely out of money. Luckily for me, my mom said she could transfer some money
*15:04.520- 15:08.800* :  into my camp. So I caught the train into Dublin and held the cab to get me and my luggage to my
*15:08.800- 15:15.300* :  hostel. Knowing I was at a cash, I asked him to stop at an ATM on the way. Unfortunately, the money
*15:15.300- 15:21.220* :  hadn't arrived my camp yet and I just about panicked. So I got back in the cab and I'm almost
*15:21.220- 15:25.500* :  in tears as I explained to the gentleman driving what the situation was. I told him I needed to ride
*15:25.500- 15:30.440* :  to the airport in the mornings and that if he was willing to pick me up again then I was sure the
*15:30.440- 15:36.240* :  money would be in my account. Luckily for me, he was very understanding and agreed. So next morning,
*15:36.240- 15:40.660* :  he picked me up, we stopped at the cash point again and thank God this time the money was there and
*15:40.660- 15:46.660* :  I was able to pay for both of the trips and add a tip for him. When I thanked him profusely for his
*15:46.660- 15:52.680* :  active kindness, he told me he had a daughter and hoped that she were ever in a similar situation
*15:52.800- 15:58.660* :  that someone would do the same for her. So I'll just give a huge shout out to any and all cab drivers
*15:58.660- 16:05.500* :  who have taken pity and shown such kindness to hapless tourists such as myself. You are all
*16:05.500- 16:12.600* :  beautiful people who make the world a much better place. Shannon from Vancouver Island and if you
*16:12.600- 16:17.620* :  have an active kindness you think would make us all smile from a taxi driver or indeed anyone else,
*16:17.960- 16:23.160* :  do send us an email or a voice note to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk
*16:28.100- 16:32.900* :  Coming up in the podcast, being a mom is a very powerful thing. Let's just give us the support
*16:32.900- 16:37.880* :  that we need. For the first time Olympic and Paralympic athletes have dedicated facilities
*16:38.360- 16:40.020* :  for breastfeeding and childcare.
*16:49.000- 16:54.140* :  It's estimated there are nearly five billion smartphones in the world and that around 60%
*16:54.140- 16:59.620* :  of the global population have won. You might be using yours right now to listen to this podcast.
*16:59.620- 17:05.520* :  But does that constant access to social media, cameras, emails and calls really make us happy?
*17:06.100- 17:10.340* :  Well the people behind a scheme in the Netherlands called the Offline Club think we'd all be more
*17:10.340- 17:15.900* :  content if we ditched our phones occasionally in favour of making real-life connections.
*17:16.660- 17:21.140* :  They hold regular events at cafes in Amsterdam and our intrepid correspondent Anna
*17:21.140- 17:23.240* :  Holligan went along to find out more.
*17:30.520- 17:36.440* :  The woman at the door, Naveen, takes my phone and places it in what looks like a hotel mini fridge.
*17:37.000- 17:40.880* :  It looks like it doesn't fit, maybe I'll okay, no no no, I will make it fit.
*17:45.400- 17:49.240* :  Inside, it's hip cafe. People are getting settled on sofas,
*17:49.540- 17:54.240* :  they're sipping on kombucha, fresh fruit smoothies, pulling out books and no pads.
*17:55.480- 17:59.460* :  My name is Ilya, I'm one of the co-founders of the Offline Club. We really don't want people
*17:59.460- 18:04.420* :  at all to even have to think about their phones. It's been scientifically proven that even when
*18:04.420- 18:10.240* :  you have the phone turned off in the same room as you are, you experience subconscious stress.
*18:10.880- 18:16.640* :  I'm a foreign correspondent and I'm a mother. I feel like it's going to make me more anxious,
*18:16.640- 18:22.640* :  not being able to know if I'm needed somewhere. I think in the first 10 minutes it might be
*18:22.640- 18:27.360* :  uncomfortable because we're so dependent on our phones. Once you have done this a couple times,
*18:27.360- 18:34.720* :  you realize that things can wait. All right, so here goes. The three-hour events broken up into
*18:34.720- 18:39.860* :  four chunks. Later on, we're all going to talk to one another. That's fine, I'm going to talk
*18:39.860- 18:46.520* :  into people. But first, we are encouraged to just sit quietly and funnily.
*18:52.380- 18:54.400* :  Just looking around and everyone looks quite chilled.
*18:56.220- 19:02.500* :  Whatever one seems to be completely and mindfully immersed in the moment, I think I need to really
*19:02.860- 19:05.660* :  work on this digital decompression.
*19:09.960- 19:13.760* :  After an hour, it's time to get up and speak to the other people in the cafe.
*19:13.820- 19:19.380* :  You were strangers and yet you're here sharing swinging sofa. I don't think this would happen
*19:19.380- 19:25.820* :  in many places. Yeah, I really like this super bright yellow sofa that's swinging. I just thought
*19:25.880- 19:32.700* :  this is the space for me. I really believe that it's important to take some time off of my screen
*19:32.700- 19:37.620* :  and I think it's way more meaningful when you share this experience with somebody else.
*19:37.720- 19:43.960* :  It's a beautiful setting. Do you feel like a frustration that you can put it online and get
*19:43.960- 19:49.340* :  the dopamine hit of all of those likes that would generate? I really feel relief of not having
*19:49.340- 19:54.860* :  to do it, knowing that I can't. What we've discovered so far is that there's really a need for
*19:54.860- 20:01.520* :  connection in today's world. So we didn't expect people to also really come for the social part
*20:01.520- 20:09.020* :  to meet people in a very low-key, easy way without social pressure. I think a lot of us are craving
*20:10.540- 20:17.640* :  authentic connections with people. I work in social media, that's how I started. It's really
*20:17.640- 20:25.500* :  toxic. I've seen just the addiction rise and the need to be on the phone scares me a little bit.
*20:26.960- 20:32.220* :  At the end of the event, I'm surprised to see not everyone's dashing to retrieve their phone.
*20:32.460- 20:36.660* :  You were one of the first to cue and get your phone back. What does this moment feel like?
*20:36.940- 20:42.440* :  It feels like to be honest because I'm going to be back to my phone addiction. I wouldn't call it
*20:42.440- 20:49.320* :  addiction, but a usage of phone. But yeah, I'm going to learn all the ideas they were given to kind
*20:49.320- 20:55.640* :  of limit my phone usage. Why were you so eager to get it back? Oh no, I think I was not actually.
*20:55.900- 21:00.460* :  You've put your phone back on to get directions, but also to share contact details with each other.
*21:00.700- 21:04.280* :  That's a connection. In the real world. Yeah, we did it.
*21:06.080- 21:10.700* :  Yeah, I didn't expect it. Honestly, like, to happen is like this, but I am happy.
*21:11.580- 21:16.940* :  I didn't expect to either, but I've really enjoyed my time at the offline club
*21:17.760- 21:25.380* :  and I'm maybe even just a bit reluctant to be returning to the updates and interruptions of the
*21:25.380- 21:26.100* :  real world.
*21:29.380- 21:35.000* :  Anna, Holigen reporting there. And you can hear more about the offline club and other ways to
*21:35.000- 21:40.660* :  cut your smartphone use on people fixing the world wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*21:41.320- 21:45.740* :  And if you've ever tried or succeeded in ditching your phone, there is no how it went.
*21:47.280- 21:51.920* :  And now for a couple of other stories we've spotted this week. A zoo here in the UK is
*21:51.920- 21:56.260* :  celebrating the birth of what it describes as one of the rarest animals on earth.
*21:56.640- 22:01.940* :  Persian onagers, which are related to donkeys, only survive in the wild in two small protected
*22:01.940- 22:08.080* :  areas of Iran, with fewer than 600 of the creatures remaining. Conservationists at Chester Zoo
*22:08.080- 22:13.300* :  say the birth of what they call the leggy youngster, who's been named Jasper, could help safeguard
*22:13.300- 22:19.340* :  the species from extinction. They say his mum Azita is doing a fantastic job, while Jasper is
*22:19.340- 22:25.000* :  said to be full of energy and enjoys playfully kicking up sand as he races around his habitat.
*22:25.960- 22:29.980* :  And a parrot has been honoured by Guinness World Records for a feat of memory,
*22:29.980- 22:36.240* :  correctly naming a series of items within three minutes. Apollo's owners say they hope to highlight
*22:36.240- 22:39.800* :  the natural intelligence of animals as Charlotte Simpson reports.
*22:40.860- 22:43.280* :  You've earned a plaque. You're now a world record bird.
*22:43.580- 22:49.000* :  Four-year-old Apollo and African grey parrot from Florida secured the record after successfully
*22:49.000- 22:56.480* :  identifying 12 items, including. What's this call? What's this call? Plant. What's this call?
*22:57.580- 23:03.340* :  Apollo achieved the feat back in 2023, but only received his plaque recently, which his
*23:03.340- 23:09.460* :  proud owners shared with his 2.8 million followers on TikTok. Dalton and Victoria said they trained
*23:09.460- 23:15.860* :  Apollo together by giving him examples of correct and incorrect responses, helped along by promises
*23:15.860- 23:22.320* :  of his favourite snack, pistachios. Apollo the parrot, who certainly know bird brain.
*23:23.440- 23:29.140* :  Now, back to Paris 2024, and for the first time in history, Olympic and Paralympic athletes,
*23:29.140- 23:34.120* :  who are breastfeeding or caring for small children have access to dedicated facilities.
*23:34.820- 23:37.600* :  In the past, children haven't been allowed in the athletes' village.
*23:38.140- 23:43.060* :  But as Nishat Ladder reports, the drive for change has come from mothers who've competed
*23:43.060- 23:48.820* :  at Paralympics. I cried a lot on the bus ride to the Olympic Village, and I was just watching
*23:48.820- 23:54.240* :  videos and looking at pictures of her, and then I got there and I just cannot sleep without her.
*23:54.620- 23:59.620* :  American marathon runner Alifine Tullyamuk competed at the Tokyo Olympics in the midst of the
*23:59.620- 24:05.480* :  pandemic, where the marathon site was in the north of Japan. She was mostly able to be with her
*24:05.480- 24:11.580* :  husband and her six-month-old baby Zoe, who she was breastfeeding, except on the first night in
*24:11.580- 24:17.440* :  the athletes' village in Tokyo, where children were banned. I slept away from my baby for the very first
*24:17.440- 24:24.280* :  time. I was so engrossed at night at like 1 a.m. I was pumping, like I called them and she's
*24:24.340- 24:29.080* :  crying. She's losing her mind because she doesn't understand why her mom is not there.
*24:29.380- 24:34.700* :  I am just so happy that it's now changed to where they actually have facilities for them. That
*24:34.700- 24:39.760* :  is pretty incredible. The issue of when to stop breastfeeding was one that Kenya born Tullyamuk had to
*24:39.760- 24:43.860* :  wrestle with. I always planned that I was going to breastfeed for three or four months,
*24:43.900- 24:47.560* :  then I'm going to stop and then that will still give me about two and a half months before
*24:47.560- 24:52.380* :  the Olympics. But then once my daughter arrived, I realized that stopping breastfeeding was not in
*24:52.380- 24:57.800* :  the curse for me. Such experiences prompted the International Olympic Committee and Paris 2024
*24:58.600- 25:03.020* :  to offer a crash in the athletes' village with space and privacy for breastfeeding mothers
*25:03.020- 25:07.600* :  to pump and store their milk. There are also nappy changing and play areas.
*25:08.140- 25:12.820* :  Emma Terho, a former winter Olympian, is chair of the IOC Athletes Commission.
*25:13.100- 25:19.120* :  We want to encourage this possibility for a female athlete to continue their career. We wanted
*25:19.120- 25:27.460* :  to make sure that there is space where they can be in quiet and in privacy still being able to
*25:27.460- 25:33.500* :  focus on probably the highlight of their career. The group and mother, which advocates for sporting
*25:33.500- 25:40.700* :  mums, was set up by middle-distance runner Elisa Montano, who famously in 2014 ran while heavily
*25:40.700- 25:46.460* :  pregnant. I felt that we haven't seen what it looks like to be a woman in my career to visibly
*25:46.460- 25:50.740* :  see her being pregnant, having her babies and continuing her career. So I'm just going to do it.
*25:50.740- 25:53.480* :  You know, that's why I ran eight months pregnant at USA Nationals.
*25:53.780- 25:56.920* :  Traveling to races while breastfeeding was also a challenge,
*25:56.920- 26:00.000* :  something Tulia Mokin counted at the Tokyo Games.
*26:00.220- 26:06.520* :  The race was moved up an hour to 6 a.m. because of the heat. I went out of time to pump.
*26:06.840- 26:11.960* :  And then I got to the starting line, you know, we had tens for Tim USA. There was no like a place
*26:11.960- 26:16.920* :  for me to like breastfeed and all pump. Nobody was thinking about the fact that they might be
*26:16.920- 26:19.180* :  athletes who are breastfeeding and what do they need.
*26:19.360- 26:23.200* :  Montano, the welcoming the Paris initiative says more needs to be done.
*26:23.260- 26:28.300* :  What I'd like to also see is at all of the venues at their safe and respectable lactation
*26:28.300- 26:32.660* :  accommodations provided with like electricity to be able to pump your breast milk and know that
*26:32.660- 26:37.300* :  there is a safe space for you to store your breast milk. The big barrier is also financially.
*26:37.420- 26:41.280* :  You can have a nursery, but you need to have like a caregiver on the other side,
*26:41.280- 26:42.740* :  and you have to be able to pay for that.
*26:42.940- 26:47.400* :  For Tulia Mokit Simple, all mothers deserve the full Olympic experience.
*26:47.880- 26:51.520* :  Being a mom is a very powerful thing. Let's just give us the support that we need.
*26:52.500- 26:56.980* :  U.S. Marathon Vada, Alephine Tulia Mook, ending that report by Nishat Ladder.
*26:57.560- 27:01.620* :  And just before we go, you may remember on an earlier episode of The HappyPod,
*27:01.620- 27:05.340* :  we talked about some of the couples competing at the Olympics in Paris.
*27:05.980- 27:11.000* :  Well, the romance of the city, it is after all the city of love, seems to have had quite an
*27:11.000- 27:17.020* :  effect on one pair. After China's Wang Ya Chong, one gold in the Badminton Mixed Doubles,
*27:17.240- 27:23.800* :  her boyfriend and fellow Olympian Liu Chen greeted her with a bouquet of red and pink roses.
*27:29.640- 27:34.180* :  Before delighting the crowd by getting down on one knee and proposing,
*27:35.020- 27:39.980* :  Wang wiped away happy tears as she said yes and showed the ring to the cheering fans,
*27:39.980- 27:45.820* :  and later called it, very surprising. And of course, if you have an unusual marriage proposal
*27:45.820- 27:50.680* :  story, we'd love to hear from you. And that's it from The HappyPod for now.
