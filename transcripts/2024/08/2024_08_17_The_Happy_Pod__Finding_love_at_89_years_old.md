*01:27.100- 01:29.520* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, and in this edition,
*01:29.520- 01:32.180* :  uploaded on Saturday the 17th of August,
*01:32.860- 01:37.360* :  newly wedged at nearly 90, how it's never too late to find love.
*01:37.640- 01:40.420* :  I think I loved it from the first time I saw it.
*01:40.640- 01:42.960* :  I couldn't save myself with anyone else.
*01:43.140- 01:46.080* :  But when I saw Mark, that was quite a different story.
*01:46.380- 01:48.720* :  Yes, I fell for him hook on and sinker.
*01:49.400- 01:51.140* :  The marathon runner from Bhutan,
*01:51.140- 01:54.320* :  who's celebrating despite coming last in the Olympics.
*01:54.740- 01:58.560* :  I was so grateful and happy that I'm not alone.
*01:59.060- 02:02.520* :  The world is cheering on me and I should try harder.
*02:03.300- 02:05.000* :  And the vlogging grandfather,
*02:05.000- 02:07.920* :  who's found a huge new following on YouTube.
*02:08.680- 02:09.720* :  Also in the podcast,
*02:09.720- 02:13.000* :  how Rwanda's first official cheerleading squad
*02:13.000- 02:14.740* :  is hoping to empower women.
*02:15.280- 02:17.080* :  Plus an amazing act of kindness
*02:17.560- 02:20.500* :  to try to repair a community hit by riots in the UK.
*02:26.020- 02:28.340* :  Now, of course, love can strike anywhere.
*02:28.600- 02:31.600* :  But our first interview is with a pair of newlyweds
*02:32.000- 02:34.420* :  who met in a care home in Australia.
*02:35.020- 02:39.900* :  Bev Martin, who is 87, fell for 89-year-old Mark Catlin
*02:39.900- 02:41.060* :  when he moved in.
*02:41.360- 02:44.760* :  In fact, she knew he was the one the moment she set eyes on him.
*02:45.260- 02:47.920* :  I spoke to them both about that initial spark
*02:47.920- 02:51.200* :  and how they came to be married in their nursing home in Tasmania.
*02:51.820- 02:53.560* :  We met in the nursing home.
*02:54.060- 02:55.500* :  I've been here seven years,
*02:55.500- 02:57.860* :  but Mark's only been here four months.
*02:58.180- 03:00.560* :  But when the day I saw he came him,
*03:00.920- 03:03.480* :  I thought, Jesus, I was looking guy, you know?
*03:03.900- 03:06.520* :  I don't know, things just escalated from there.
*03:06.980- 03:09.620* :  And we're just preling love with each other,
*03:09.620- 03:10.540* :  a simple set.
*03:10.540- 03:12.440* :  And we were back lonely people,
*03:12.640- 03:15.420* :  like I'd been married before for 56 years.
*03:15.980- 03:18.940* :  Mark's been on his own for quite a few years, too.
*03:19.320- 03:21.940* :  So he caught your eye the moment he walked in?
*03:22.120- 03:22.940* :  Oh, he sure did.
*03:24.060- 03:25.920* :  And Mark, did you feel her eyes on you?
*03:26.100- 03:27.760* :  Well, I thought something was happening
*03:27.760- 03:30.780* :  because I was either all across the room.
*03:31.020- 03:33.120* :  Well, we were in the dining room.
*03:33.340- 03:36.880* :  And I thought, that way, I reckon she'd be a nice lady.
*03:37.100- 03:38.980* :  Oh, man, it was just instantly.
*03:38.980- 03:41.540* :  The more we saw each other, the more we fell out
*03:41.720- 03:45.540* :  or plucked up the carries to ask where our room was.
*03:45.960- 03:48.280* :  And I said, could I come and see it?
*03:48.280- 03:49.200* :  She said, oh, yeah.
*03:49.540- 03:52.960* :  So that started all from there and never stopped.
*03:53.140- 03:55.920* :  I think I loved him from the first time I saw him.
*03:56.160- 03:58.320* :  And did you have the courage to talk to him straight away?
*03:58.600- 04:01.120* :  No, I didn't have the courage at all.
*04:01.720- 04:04.580* :  That came a bit later, a couple of weeks' problems with him.
*04:04.980- 04:06.920* :  I just can't believe it.
*04:07.080- 04:08.820* :  You know, for two people, they were age.
*04:09.160- 04:11.280* :  But then we thought, we're old people.
*04:11.320- 04:14.820* :  And we don't know how much longer we've got left on Earth.
*04:15.040- 04:18.200* :  So why can't we be romantic and, you know,
*04:18.200- 04:20.460* :  make the most of it what we've got left?
*04:20.720- 04:22.740* :  Interesting to hear how you behave, though,
*04:22.900- 04:25.840* :  on almost like teenagers with that hesitation.
*04:26.080- 04:27.480* :  Yeah, I can agree with you.
*04:27.480- 04:30.760* :  I feel like a teenager some day.
*04:31.020- 04:32.360* :  And tell us about the wedding.
*04:32.360- 04:34.420* :  The first time in a care home, I understand.
*04:34.660- 04:36.680* :  It's the first wedding that had here.
*04:37.040- 04:39.140* :  And we had a beautiful day
*04:39.140- 04:41.980* :  and we had a beautiful reception thanks to them.
*04:42.280- 04:44.000* :  It cost us a saint, you know?
*04:44.000- 04:45.760* :  They'd done the whole lot.
*04:45.760- 04:49.200* :  And it was absolutely beautiful, fantastic.
*04:49.520- 04:51.640* :  And she was walking down the carpet.
*04:52.060- 04:53.480* :  She was fantastic.
*04:53.520- 04:55.080* :  Reduced bitter deeds.
*04:55.500- 04:57.060* :  They, uh, that's how much I love her.
*04:57.180- 04:59.240* :  And what was the reaction of your families
*04:59.240- 05:01.580* :  when you told them that you guys were getting married?
*05:01.880- 05:02.160* :  Shock.
*05:03.260- 05:04.280* :  But they're all good now.
*05:04.280- 05:06.380* :  They've all got used to you.
*05:06.380- 05:06.560* :  Yeah.
*05:06.560- 05:08.180* :  And really happy for us.
*05:08.400- 05:12.680* :  I suppose a lot of people see love as a young person's game.
*05:12.920- 05:14.500* :  Yes, that's what they do.
*05:14.900- 05:15.780* :  But you've proved them wrong.
*05:16.060- 05:16.580* :  That's right.
*05:16.580- 05:17.020* :  Yeah.
*05:17.960- 05:20.100* :  Well, it's not be a little different
*05:20.100- 05:23.340* :  like with two-on-people, but it's still love.
*05:23.760- 05:26.100* :  And what tips would you have for those who
*05:26.560- 05:28.160* :  think they're just never going to find love?
*05:28.480- 05:29.460* :  Just keep it looking.
*05:29.860- 05:30.120* :  Yeah.
*05:30.120- 05:33.300* :  And, uh, you know, it just happens.
*05:33.880- 05:34.880* :  You'll know when it happens.
*05:35.320- 05:36.060* :  Talk about it.
*05:36.080- 05:38.740* :  If you've got feelings for someone, talk about it.
*05:38.740- 05:41.340* :  You know, let the person know how you feel.
*05:41.720- 05:43.380* :  Now, as you say, you were, you were married
*05:44.240- 05:44.980* :  for many years.
*05:44.980- 05:46.460* :  You both lost your partners.
*05:47.100- 05:48.740* :  Did you think you would ever find love again?
*05:48.980- 05:49.240* :  No.
*05:49.640- 05:50.120* :  I did it.
*05:50.440- 05:51.900* :  I did it with one love again.
*05:52.280- 05:54.680* :  They couldn't see myself with anyone else.
*05:54.860- 05:57.760* :  But when I saw Mark, that was quite a different story.
*05:58.100- 05:58.240* :  Yeah.
*05:58.400- 06:00.460* :  So I fell for him hooked on and sink her.
*06:00.680- 06:00.920* :  Yeah.
*06:01.140- 06:02.260* :  It was the same with me.
*06:02.560- 06:04.800* :  I'd never thought I'd ever get married again.
*06:04.800- 06:05.720* :  Or, you know,
*06:05.980- 06:08.120* :  be partners that I had before.
*06:08.120- 06:10.100* :  She'd been passed away.
*06:10.500- 06:11.520* :  I've been five years.
*06:11.920- 06:13.200* :  You know, I never thought, you know,
*06:13.200- 06:16.160* :  I'd part another partner like that just like that.
*06:17.340- 06:19.800* :  Well, it's a good looking, best looking guy idea.
*06:20.080- 06:20.960* :  That tells you a lot.
*06:21.900- 06:24.060* :  Yeah, well, I'm, I'm, I mean, you know,
*06:24.060- 06:26.160* :  and they don't think where I am.
*06:26.280- 06:28.820* :  They say, I didn't know, and you, you couldn't make it.
*06:28.920- 06:30.720* :  So I lost that something.
*06:31.960- 06:34.600* :  Newlywed smart Catlin and Bev Martin.
*06:35.680- 06:38.440* :  The 38 million channels currently on YouTube
*06:38.440- 06:41.940* :  are watched by more than two billion people every month.
*06:41.960- 06:44.980* :  One of those channels with a rather smaller audience
*06:45.520- 06:48.280* :  belongs to an American grandfather and travel vlogger
*06:48.280- 06:49.620* :  called Eric Clarke.
*06:50.060- 06:52.980* :  For the past 10 years, he's been sharing his global adventures
*06:52.980- 06:55.180* :  with a very small number of subscribers,
*06:55.560- 06:56.680* :  mainly his grandchildren.
*06:57.360- 06:59.200* :  Last week on his travels, he had a chance
*06:59.200- 07:02.580* :  encounter at a dentist in Albania that changed all that.
*07:02.580- 07:05.020* :  He got talking to a social media influencer
*07:05.020- 07:06.060* :  in the waiting room,
*07:06.060- 07:08.280* :  and she found his story so charming,
*07:08.860- 07:10.140* :  she shared it on X.
*07:10.480- 07:13.340* :  That post has had nearly 12 million views,
*07:13.340- 07:17.540* :  and now Eric has tens of thousands of new YouTube followers.
*07:18.260- 07:19.160* :  He spoke to Shivonli.
*07:19.820- 07:22.580* :  I always call my, my grandkids once a weekend stuff
*07:22.620- 07:24.320* :  and, and my son and my mom.
*07:24.380- 07:26.960* :  You know, and when you try to convey where you're at,
*07:27.060- 07:29.080* :  you know, you just can't express it enough.
*07:29.080- 07:33.940* :  You can't share enough words to express how incredible it is
*07:33.960- 07:36.460* :  and how gorgeous it is and the scenery and the sounds
*07:36.460- 07:37.220* :  and the smells.
*07:37.820- 07:40.980* :  And I realized that after a while of trying to do this,
*07:41.260- 07:42.840* :  I should try to do some videos.
*07:43.240- 07:45.680* :  And so I tried to do some videos with my iPhone.
*07:46.320- 07:48.800* :  And that was a pretty rough one.
*07:48.940- 07:52.240* :  You know, my grandkids gave me a lot of, a lot of grief.
*07:52.440- 07:55.820* :  And so the feedback became really critical for me
*07:55.820- 07:57.120* :  and my, and my videos.
*07:57.260- 08:00.040* :  And so I started to look for a different type of camera.
*08:00.040- 08:01.620* :  And so I started filming.
*08:01.620- 08:04.120* :  And then, then we'd really talk about things.
*08:04.240- 08:04.800* :  They'd be like,
*08:04.800- 08:06.680* :  Grandpa, look at the waterfalls on that.
*08:06.780- 08:10.740* :  And you could really share the image and the experience.
*08:10.860- 08:13.340* :  And they could hear the joy in my voice.
*08:13.520- 08:15.240* :  And they could hear me talking about it.
*08:15.300- 08:18.280* :  And I really see it like I'm taking them with me.
*08:18.420- 08:20.560* :  You know, my mom passed on that travel bug.
*08:20.560- 08:22.580* :  Maybe I can pass on the travel bug too.
*08:22.940- 08:26.020* :  You had to somewhat modest number of followers
*08:26.720- 08:28.000* :  for a number of years.
*08:28.180- 08:31.620* :  Did you ever set about to kind of try and increase that?
*08:31.640- 08:33.260* :  Or was it always just for your grandkids?
*08:33.640- 08:34.300* :  I just filmed.
*08:34.480- 08:37.600* :  It wasn't an effort to go out and get subscribers.
*08:37.700- 08:41.200* :  You know, and it's funny because, you know, I started with 10.
*08:41.200- 08:42.980* :  And I think they were all family.
*08:43.280- 08:45.560* :  And then after a while, that 10 became 20.
*08:45.560- 08:46.960* :  And then 20 became 100.
*08:46.960- 08:48.760* :  And then, and then I got to 500.
*08:48.760- 08:51.640* :  And then I really realized that there were other people
*08:51.640- 08:52.640* :  watching my videos.
*08:53.020- 08:56.600* :  Tell me about when you realized that a chance encounter
*08:56.600- 09:01.120* :  you had at a dentist had gone quite massively viral.
*09:01.560- 09:02.320* :  Correct. Yeah.
*09:02.460- 09:03.780* :  I ran into Moe.
*09:03.900- 09:05.940* :  She asked me, you know, why did the videos?
*09:05.940- 09:07.380* :  And I told her that it was really,
*09:07.380- 09:10.420* :  I started it just to share with my grandkids.
*09:10.660- 09:12.080* :  And she loved the videos.
*09:12.460- 09:15.660* :  And so she started posting, you know,
*09:15.660- 09:18.220* :  that information about the videos on her site.
*09:18.280- 09:20.260* :  And so she has so many followers.
*09:20.540- 09:22.820* :  And it really started a cascade event.
*09:22.820- 09:25.100* :  And there were so many people.
*09:25.100- 09:28.280* :  I think I got like four or five thousand emails
*09:28.280- 09:32.400* :  from all the people subscribing to the YouTube channel.
*09:32.520- 09:34.440* :  And even people coming back and saying that
*09:34.640- 09:37.080* :  that they didn't really have contact with their grandparents
*09:37.080- 09:37.760* :  and stuff.
*09:37.960- 09:40.920* :  And they'd like to be part of my grandkids family.
*09:41.140- 09:42.880* :  And that's another thing I've learned
*09:42.880- 09:44.900* :  is that a lot of these people feel like
*09:45.660- 09:46.920* :  they are part of the family.
*09:47.120- 09:48.860* :  That sense of community that you describe.
*09:48.920- 09:49.740* :  How does that feel?
*09:49.740- 09:51.620* :  All those messages that you're getting from people.
*09:51.620- 09:53.160* :  It's amazing.
*09:53.440- 09:54.060* :  And you know what?
*09:54.060- 09:55.020* :  I love it.
*09:55.120- 09:57.220* :  It's funny because I'm kind of ADHD.
*09:57.220- 10:01.480* :  And so finding the right words is really hard for me.
*10:01.600- 10:03.460* :  And so if you watch any of my videos,
*10:03.460- 10:06.480* :  you'll see that the word I come up with most of the time
*10:06.480- 10:08.760* :  is, wow, it's just amazing to me.
*10:08.760- 10:10.380* :  And I'm not thinking about my words.
*10:10.380- 10:12.160* :  I'm thinking about what I'm looking at.
*10:12.360- 10:13.980* :  Wow, what do you think?
*10:14.780- 10:18.440* :  How have your family reacted to your kind of newfound fame?
*10:18.680- 10:20.240* :  I think the kids are really excited.
*10:20.240- 10:21.580* :  The grandkids are really excited.
*10:21.580- 10:23.280* :  I know my son was really excited.
*10:23.720- 10:24.420* :  And he said, wow.
*10:24.840- 10:26.580* :  And I think they're proud of it.
*10:26.640- 10:28.860* :  And you know, that just forms my heart.
*10:28.980- 10:30.360* :  And their joy is my joy.
*10:30.920- 10:35.080* :  What would you say to others who are a little bit afraid
*10:35.080- 10:38.240* :  of what other people might think in terms of embarking
*10:38.240- 10:40.900* :  on a sort of job or past time like yours?
*10:41.160- 10:41.840* :  Don't be afraid.
*10:42.280- 10:45.440* :  You know, we didn't know how to ride a bike before we rode the bike.
*10:45.740- 10:48.480* :  And so yeah, it's a learning process.
*10:48.820- 10:49.640* :  You know, step up.
*10:49.800- 10:50.780* :  It's going to be uncomfortable.
*10:50.820- 10:51.820* :  You're going to make mistakes.
*10:51.820- 10:53.060* :  It's not going to be perfect.
*10:53.620- 10:54.720* :  But that's how we learn.
*10:54.720- 10:55.740* :  That's how we grow.
*10:55.740- 10:57.080* :  That's how we move forward.
*10:57.620- 11:00.860* :  YouTuber Eric Clark talking to Shivon Lehi for the happy pod.
*11:01.720- 11:03.200* :  Last Sunday, Paris said,
*11:03.200- 11:04.540* :  or of what, the Olympics?
*11:05.020- 11:07.140* :  One of the final events was the women's marathon.
*11:07.140- 11:11.220* :  It was a thriller, one in a sprint in an Olympic record
*11:11.220- 11:13.120* :  of just under two hours, 23 minutes.
*11:13.840- 11:16.300* :  But 90 minutes after that gold medal was one,
*11:16.300- 11:20.240* :  Kinzang Lamu from Bhutan was still on the course,
*11:20.820- 11:23.640* :  slowing to a walk a long way behind the rest of the field.
*11:24.320- 11:25.260* :  She kept going, though,
*11:25.500- 11:27.580* :  cheered on by a crowd of spectators,
*11:27.580- 11:30.560* :  many walking alongside her on the other side of the barriers.
*11:31.180- 11:32.820* :  It was an amazing sight.
*11:32.820- 11:36.700* :  And although the 26-year-old finished last in a time of three hours,
*11:37.120- 11:39.080* :  52 minutes, 59 seconds,
*11:39.920- 11:43.340* :  she showed that achievement isn't always about winning a medal.
*11:44.060- 11:46.740* :  Kinzang Lamu told the BBC World Service
*11:46.740- 11:49.480* :  she'd been realistic about her chances in the marathon
*11:49.480- 11:51.580* :  and couldn't have done it without the crowds.
*11:52.500- 11:58.020* :  First Olympic marathon, I have no intention to give up no matter what
*11:58.020- 12:00.480* :  cause I knew that I cannot win the medal.
*12:01.260- 12:05.040* :  But I have to compete my race for my country and for myself.
*12:05.540- 12:07.560* :  That is the only thing on my mind.
*12:07.940- 12:08.860* :  So I have tried.
*12:09.500- 12:13.920* :  The feeling I have made when I hear the voice of people cheering on me
*12:13.920- 12:18.760* :  is like, I was so grateful and happy that I'm not alone.
*12:19.280- 12:22.720* :  The world is cheering on me and I should try harder.
*12:23.480- 12:26.980* :  I am thrilled to receive a lot of support and encouragement from
*12:27.480- 12:29.420* :  you are true and the last runner.
*12:30.120- 12:34.520* :  Tell you guys you have helped me to complete this race by cheering me on.
*12:34.800- 12:35.760* :  Tell you so much.
*12:36.720- 12:42.300* :  Kinzang Lamu from Bhutan and Bhutan incidentally is one of the happiest countries in the world.
*12:43.320- 12:46.080* :  Now to some good news that has emerged from tragedy.
*12:46.760- 12:50.280* :  After violent unrest broke out in the UK earlier this month,
*12:50.640- 12:53.480* :  communities have been coming together to clear up the damage.
*12:53.540- 12:57.760* :  There have been some amazing acts of kindness as people try to repair
*12:57.760- 12:59.380* :  breakages and heal the hurt.
*13:00.200- 13:03.620* :  One of those helping restore some joy is Alex McCormick.
*13:03.760- 13:08.780* :  She is from the English city of Liverpool and began fundraising after her local library
*13:08.780- 13:10.420* :  was torched by rioters.
*13:11.000- 13:15.340* :  Hundreds of books were destroyed and classes and group activities had to be cancelled
*13:15.760- 13:16.980* :  as the building was boarded up.
*13:17.660- 13:22.060* :  Alex's original fundraising target was the equivalent of $650.
*13:23.100- 13:25.400* :  But she's exceeded that by a long way.
*13:25.720- 13:27.060* :  So what is the current total?
*13:27.780- 13:34.180* :  We are currently at $248,341 pounds.
*13:34.340- 13:38.020* :  Right, that's about $320,000.
*13:38.340- 13:41.980* :  What made you start this campaign in the first place?
*13:42.380- 13:46.000* :  It was just a case of feeling a bit helpless after seeing the unrest
*13:46.500- 13:49.580* :  and seeing a library and a community hub street.
*13:49.580- 13:53.880* :  It's hard not to be affected by that knowing that the people who are going to miss out
*13:53.880- 13:56.560* :  the most are children and all the people.
*13:57.320- 14:00.480* :  I thought maybe we could just fundraise a couple of hundred pounds,
*14:00.640- 14:04.180* :  replace some of the books that were banned and that would be that.
*14:04.180- 14:06.780* :  I never imagined that it would get to the point that it's got to.
*14:07.040- 14:11.400* :  Yeah, why do you think it has resonated so much with the community and even around the world?
*14:12.060- 14:15.180* :  Everyone's got a bit of a special place in their hearts for a good book
*14:15.860- 14:19.080* :  and for the way that libraries and reading in general brings us together.
*14:19.080- 14:24.020* :  I do think that just touches people's hearts in a way that makes them feel
*14:24.020- 14:28.220* :  they can relate to the situation even if they've never been near the library that it's happened to.
*14:28.500- 14:33.220* :  I had never stepped foot in that library until after the fundraising started
*14:33.820- 14:37.860* :  but you don't need to have been in a place to feel sadness for the destruction that's happened.
*14:37.860- 14:41.360* :  And just describe your feeling as you saw that number going up and up.
*14:41.660- 14:45.180* :  I don't think that there's a word that I could really put on how
*14:45.220- 14:49.140* :  incredible that felt just to know that people were so generous.
*14:50.300- 14:53.300* :  Just a little bit overwhelmed. Is the best ways to describe how I felt?
*14:53.820- 14:57.980* :  Yeah, you've raised a huge amount of money. What will the library be able to do with it?
*14:58.260- 15:01.740* :  Obviously we will be replacing the books that were lost in the fire.
*15:01.980- 15:05.660* :  But the hope now is to really be able to engage more in the community.
*15:05.660- 15:10.680* :  So the plan is to put on more community outreach events more things for kids,
*15:10.740- 15:16.940* :  baby classes. We really want to be able to engage in the community on another level now.
*15:17.340- 15:20.980* :  So something better might actually come out of what was at a terrible event?
*15:21.240- 15:25.400* :  Absolutely. Sometimes the most positive things come from something that begins
*15:25.400- 15:31.400* :  quite sad. Sometimes it takes something like this to happen to be a reminder for us to engage more
*15:31.400- 15:36.060* :  with all the people around us and to not have so many negative feelings with everything
*15:36.060- 15:37.460* :  negative that goes on in the world.
*15:38.160- 15:39.680* :  fundraiser Alex McCormick
*15:44.980- 15:51.140* :  and still to come on the happy pod, the Bosnian businessman who turned a park into his favorite painting.
*15:59.860- 16:03.780* :  It's that time of the year. You're a vacation is coming up.
*16:04.440- 16:12.620* :  You can already hear the beach waves feel the warm breeze relax and think about work.
*16:12.620- 16:15.900* :  You really really want it all to work out while you're away.
*16:16.340- 16:18.780* :  Monday.com gives you and the team that peace of mind.

*17:17.140- 17:23.020* :  Gaelic football is hugely popular in Ireland. Its biggest stars are well known across the country
*17:23.020- 17:28.580* :  but as alachers they're not paid a salary. Contrast that to the richest sport in the world,
*17:28.580- 17:34.260* :  the NFL, the top American football league, with players who earn many millions and a household
*17:34.260- 17:40.700* :  names. Well 122 year old Gaelic footballer from Northern Ireland has now switched codes and
*17:40.700- 17:46.820* :  gone to kicking field goals for the New Orleans Saints. In fact Charlie Smith secured a preseason
*17:46.820- 17:53.440* :  victory for his team with his first ever kick in an NFL match. Charlie's dad Leo Smith spoke to
*17:53.440- 17:59.120* :  Joel Tuggett about the achievement. Fantastic. I've really, really proud moment for the whole
*17:59.120- 18:05.160* :  family and extended family. It was really unbelievable to say myself I'm a wife Julie and with
*18:05.160- 18:09.680* :  daughter Caitlin were sitting up watching Charlie just before he came onto the pitch to take that
*18:09.680- 18:15.660* :  last kick. The feeling was just surreal. We were watching them prancing up and down and we were
*18:15.660- 18:20.780* :  really nervous on those butterflies in the stomach but the nail the kick like he did was unbelievable
*18:20.780- 18:25.480* :  on the buzz that it created was unreal. Were there butterflies in the stomach and the nerves
*18:25.480- 18:29.960* :  in the room whenever you realised how close this was to the finish? It might be the match defining
*18:30.100- 18:36.060* :  moment. Yes, the sure was and I say with eight seconds to go to take the you know to be in the
*18:36.060- 18:40.840* :  possession to take that kick has to say we were nearly second you know just watching it and
*18:40.840- 18:46.860* :  same nail it unbelievable you know you can't describe that. So Charlie's ended up here. He's part
*18:46.860- 18:53.260* :  of this international player pathway program and he started in Gaelic games. He was a former down
*18:53.260- 18:59.340* :  under 20 goalkeeper. So when he came in the door at some point Leo and said to you you know what it
*18:59.340- 19:04.960* :  is that I'm thinking of American football and I might go and play for one of these NFL teams but
*19:04.960- 19:10.900* :  what was your initial reaction? Well to be honest with you when you took the national step last
*19:10.900- 19:16.240* :  August believe it or not he didn't tell us for the first three weeks that he'd even go on
*19:16.240- 19:20.960* :  tell a practice session. Right. It was literally after about three to four weeks you know he'd
*19:20.960- 19:26.900* :  taken one or two sessions with the gay type leader who conducted the program you know the kicking
*19:26.900- 19:32.640* :  program for anyone that had potential knowing either rugby soccer or Gaelic whatever who could kick
*19:32.640- 19:37.600* :  a ball literally. Now we all knew that Charlie had the talent you know he had a long kick but
*19:38.340- 19:43.620* :  and he also had the passion for the NFL and again you know we just thought he was watching
*19:43.620- 19:48.540* :  red zone on the Sunday afternoon just as the past time you know but we didn't realize his passion
*19:48.540- 19:54.640* :  was as strong for for the game as what it was and for that opportunity to erase last year
*19:54.640- 20:01.120* :  it just went from strength to strength and we're just let them live the journey you know that he's
*20:01.120- 20:06.020* :  on at the moment and we'll continue to support him and this is a really just wish him all the best
*20:06.020- 20:10.820* :  and and wherever it takes him so be it. So were you a fan would you have been sitting
*20:10.820- 20:15.080* :  watching all these matches with him or are you now having the brush up because you know you're
*20:15.080- 20:19.880* :  going to have to be watching Charlie now every week? To be honest I would have watched the odd game
*20:19.880- 20:24.800* :  but I wouldn't have much of a clue on the race to be honest. He was keeping you right he's not
*20:24.800- 20:28.800* :  there. He didn't get it right anymore. He's not there but now he's since he's gone over to
*20:28.800- 20:34.400* :  America and sort of following it religiously and and following the the same YouTube channels and
*20:34.400- 20:37.500* :  you know just to see does he get mentioned during the day at practice. Are you going to get across
*20:37.500- 20:42.840* :  to see him much? Yes so we're really looking forward to it and the daughter who Molly is over in America
*20:42.840- 20:46.860* :  she's going to fly down and meet up with us so we will the whole family will be there.
*20:47.520- 20:53.620* :  Charlie Smith's proud dad Leo. Moving on from the NFL to another popular American sport
*20:53.620- 20:59.320* :  one that's made its way to Rwanda. Cheerleading popularised in films like Bring It On
*20:59.320- 21:04.760* :  and High School Musical is a physically testing activity which consists of gymnastics, dancing
*21:04.760- 21:10.920* :  and acrobatic stunts but in Rwanda it's being used to help empower women. The nation has introduced
*21:10.920- 21:15.680* :  its first official cheerleading squad and they even performed at one of Rwanda's biggest sporting
*21:16.020- 21:25.200* :  events is Abella Jewel has the story. A cheerleading team with a twist and no I'm not talking about
*21:25.200- 21:32.320* :  a dance move although they can do that too. This is the sound of Rwanda's first and only official
*21:32.320- 21:38.620* :  cheerleading squad. They're in Kigali practicing their routine dressed all in black, shaking gold
*21:38.620- 21:48.700* :  and silver pom-poms. We want to develop cheerleading here and make it valuable. We want it to become
*21:48.700- 21:53.820* :  productive to those who love it. The squad was formed last year by Rwanda and dance agency
*21:53.820- 22:01.740* :  Kessie Garambe works there. It's helping to give a platform to these girls. The girls who are
*22:01.740- 22:07.340* :  part of the squad are eager to develop themselves and improve their lives. For them and their family
*22:08.020- 22:14.100* :  sports like basketball are becoming more and more popular in Rwanda so naturally it was time
*22:14.100- 22:20.300* :  to train up some cheerleaders and the dancers say the sport has had a big impact on their self-esteem
*22:20.340- 22:29.840* :  like 16-year-olds Benita Adede. First of all cheerleading has given me confidence because before
*22:29.840- 22:36.240* :  I could not go in front of a camera but now I can and I see people posting me everywhere on
*22:43.840- 22:48.420* :  social media. Their first paid gig was a tall order to perform at this year's basketball
*22:48.420- 22:56.020* :  African League final in Kigali and for the young dancers nerves were high. This is something my
*22:56.020- 23:02.340* :  colleagues and I have prepared for a long time and now we've done it. The night before I did not
*23:02.340- 23:10.880* :  sleep. I was just wondering is it morning yet? It felt very good. I just felt taken away by
*23:10.880- 23:17.920* :  emotions. It was my first time in front of such a big audience and we did everything perfectly
*23:18.720- 23:28.720* :  and we are all happy. Kessie Garambe from the dance agency was proud to watch from the sidelines.
*23:31.420- 23:38.320* :  We are all happy because of how well it went and how the wonders were cheering us on. We had
*23:38.320- 23:46.820* :  fears on different things but nothing went wrong. That report by Isabella Joule and thanks to
*23:46.820- 23:53.260* :  Ivert Kabatasi from the BBC's Rwanda Bureau who interviewed the cheerleaders. The ocean floor
*23:53.260- 23:58.280* :  is something that marine biologists want to study pretty closely but a team at the University of
*23:58.280- 24:04.480* :  Adelaide has found a way to improve their view of what goes on underwater by turning sea lions
*24:04.480- 24:09.580* :  into camera crews. As part of a study the animals were safely fitted with small cameras that
*24:09.580- 24:15.560* :  once recovered allowed scientists to see exactly what they'd been up to. Nathan Angelakis who
*24:15.560- 24:21.420* :  is part of the research spoke to Roland Pies on the podcast Science in Action. Each sea lion gets
*24:21.420- 24:26.940* :  equipped with an underwater camera that's custom built for our purpose and then they also get a GPS
*24:26.940- 24:31.900* :  tracker which goes just behind the camera that we use to get data on their movements and then
*24:31.900- 24:36.420* :  they also get a little device on the crown of their head. Sea lions are pretty big animals
*24:36.560- 24:41.940* :  presumably doing this as a pretty delicate business. It is yeah and we obviously have to be really
*24:41.940- 24:46.740* :  safe and careful when the welfare of the animal is always first and foremost. I mean having done
*24:46.740- 24:52.940* :  that you are getting are you a sort of very different and much better view of the sea bed?
*24:53.360- 24:57.620* :  Yeah I guess it's completely different from other ways that researchers traditionally surveyed
*24:57.620- 25:02.380* :  the sea bed so this is amazing having the perspective from the animal themselves as they move
*25:02.380- 25:07.620* :  through in their environment. You've put the kit on the head. What do you see after that? When we
*25:07.620- 25:11.980* :  put a device out we don't really know what we're going to get back until we recapture the animal
*25:11.980- 25:17.260* :  and recover the instruments. That's always amazing when you click on that first video file and
*25:17.260- 25:21.240* :  you know the animal dives down at the bottom and then you finally see what it's been doing.
*25:21.420- 25:27.340* :  I suppose what I'm wondering is the scientific payback from this? Yeah I mean there's lots of
*25:27.340- 25:31.560* :  things you get from this so mapping the habitats that the sea lions use but also mapping
*25:31.560- 25:36.100* :  habitats across southern Australia but we can also get really important data on their
*25:36.100- 25:40.440* :  foraging strategies so the different strategies they use to target different prey.
*25:40.740- 25:47.960* :  This is all possible because of the miniaturization of things like cameras. Do you think there's a
*25:47.960- 25:53.060* :  particular advantage using an animal? Yeah definitely. I mean I guess when we're talking about
*25:53.060- 25:57.700* :  comparing it with more traditional surveys, more traditional surveys are using really
*25:57.700- 26:04.420* :  specialized boats and camera which require specialized crew and quite a few people to man and you
*26:04.420- 26:09.520* :  need a lot of things to line up. That makes it a little bit difficult at times to map large parts
*26:09.520- 26:14.580* :  of the marine environment so that's one of the real advantages of having sea lions. We were
*26:14.580- 26:18.640* :  mapping parts of the ocean that haven't been explored or observed before so the sea lions are
*26:18.640- 26:23.200* :  giving us critical information. Also we're able to assess how these habitats might be driven or
*26:23.200- 26:28.400* :  impacted by different oceanographic and environmental conditions. Does that's one thing about you know
*26:28.520- 26:32.640* :  how stable these pictures are? There must be times when they're just going round and round in
*26:32.640- 26:38.120* :  circles not doing very much. I mean we're quite lucky that the cameras we have are really really
*26:38.120- 26:43.960* :  good quality and the video quality is amazing even at depths of you know 100 110 meters but there
*26:43.960- 26:49.720* :  is obviously a lot of thrashing about and you have this animal just starting in and around rocks
*26:49.720- 26:56.540* :  and reefs and there are some moments that are very very fast pace. Nathan and Jalakis talking to
*26:56.540- 27:03.140* :  Roland Pies. Now I don't know much about art but I was very impressed a few years ago when I visited
*27:03.140- 27:08.720* :  an immersive exhibition inside a former gas works. The walls, floors and ceilings had all been
*27:08.720- 27:15.000* :  transformed into a canvas for moving images of the artist's work. Well a man from Bosnia has
*27:15.000- 27:22.360* :  taken that idea one step further as Wendy Urkart explains. Halim Zukic was a business man in Bosnia
*27:22.700- 27:30.100* :  but his dream was to recreate an iconic piece of art in a natural park so he started buying up
*27:30.100- 27:37.140* :  patches of land but he hadn't really decided how he would pull off such a feat across nearly 25 acres.
*27:37.700- 27:44.540* :  He says it was only when he saw a farmer working in the fields that an idea really started to take
*27:49.080- 27:55.000* :  shape. The tractor went over the meadows leaving wheel tracks that were minded me of a spiral.
*27:55.580- 28:02.740* :  In that moment I no longer had any doubt about the direction I would take. It was the spiral
*28:03.240- 28:08.680* :  from Van Gogh's painting. It was the moment that would define the west of my life.
*28:18.580- 28:25.120* :  He's talking about Vincent Van Gogh's masterpiece The Starry Night famous for its heavy brush strokes
*28:25.120- 28:32.240* :  colored swirls and shining stars in a deep blue night sky. The moon and Venus sit above a village
*28:32.240- 28:40.380* :  framed by rolling hills and a cypress tree dominates the foreground. Halim decided to turn his
*28:40.380- 28:47.300* :  park into a giant version of The Starry Night painting and he's very proud of how his version
*28:47.300- 28:59.360* :  turned out. This work is done with a palette of aromatic plants and herbs. I've got about 130,000
*28:59.360- 29:07.100* :  lavender bushes and the artwork itself covers around 10 hectares, making it perhaps the largest
*29:07.100- 29:14.400* :  piece of art in the world. It's a complete replica of Van Gogh's celebrated work and was a
*29:14.400- 29:21.940* :  labour of love for Halim who did all the landscaping himself. He planted trees and created 13 lakes
*29:21.940- 29:30.420* :  using existing natural streams and the park is now open to the public. The original of The Starry
*29:30.420- 29:38.220* :  Night is on show at the Museum of Modern Art or MoMA in New York City, but now art lovers can also
*29:38.220- 29:44.460* :  stroll through Halim's version of Van Gogh's masterpiece in the hills of Central Bosnia.
*29:45.100- 29:46.400* :  And that was Wendy Irkhardt.
*29:51.980- 29:56.120* :  That's all from the happy pod for now. If you have any stories that will make a smile,
