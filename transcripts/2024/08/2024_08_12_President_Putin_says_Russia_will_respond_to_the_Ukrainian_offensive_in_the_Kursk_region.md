*00:22.100- 00:26.000* :  Our recommendation to say to Benafian's Rinkle smoothing eye cream, which targets five types
*00:26.000- 00:30.680* :  of eye-area wrinkles in her corner under eye, crow's feet, around eye and frown lines. Plus,
*00:30.680- 00:35.080* :  it helps to treat dark circles and eye-bag puffiness too. No two people experience eye-aging the same

*00:46.960- 00:52.480* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundredth mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*00:52.480- 00:55.940* :  no, you know, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.
*00:56.140- 01:00.900* :  I mean, it's unlimited, premium, wireless for $15 a month. How are there still people paying
*01:00.900- 01:04.500* :  two or three times that much? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.

*01:19.720- 01:22.480* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.700- 01:28.600* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 12th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:29.300- 01:35.480* :  Russia is evacuating people from another border region as Ukraine continues its surprise attack.
*01:36.280- 01:41.680* :  Greece's most severe wildfire this year is approaching the northern outskirts of the capital
*01:41.680- 01:47.820* :  Athens. The leader of a Kenyan cult has gone on trial for manslaughter following the discovery
*01:47.820- 01:56.840* :  last year of more than 400 bodies in mass graves. Also in this broadcast, the US has sent a submarine
*01:56.840- 02:01.460* :  to the Middle East. We'll hear from our chief international correspondent on the later situation
*02:01.460- 02:07.240* :  in the region. And after the Olympic Games, President Macron thanks volunteers and organizers
*02:07.240- 02:10.480* :  in Paris and says they prove the doubters wrong.
*02:14.160- 02:19.260* :  Increasing numbers of Russians are being moved from their homes as Ukraine continues a week-long
*02:19.260- 02:25.840* :  military offensive in the Kursk region. Its governor Alexei Smirnoff said evacuation orders had
*02:25.840- 02:32.160* :  been extended to the Belovsky district south of Ukraine's main manoeuvres and with a population
*02:32.200- 02:39.520* :  of 14,000 people. A further 11,000 have left their homes in an adjoining district of the Bielgorod
*02:39.520- 02:45.720* :  region because of what its governor called enemy activity on the border. All videos online show
*02:45.720- 02:51.300* :  Ukrainian soldiers in Russian villages raising their blue and yellow national flag on official
*02:51.300- 02:56.980* :  buildings. Thousands of soldiers are now believed to be as far as 30 kilometers inside Russian
*02:56.980- 03:02.760* :  territory. James Waterhouse is in Ukraine's Sumi region close to the border with Russia.
*03:03.180- 03:10.540* :  We've seen notably around the city of Sumi a lot of military vehicles. Ukrainian tanks, personnel
*03:10.540- 03:17.560* :  carriers, supply trucks, all emblazoned with this triangle logo on the side, suggesting they're
*03:17.560- 03:24.180* :  all part of the same operation. And there I say there's a sort of whiff of morale in the air
*03:24.500- 03:28.620* :  because for the first time there is a movement and clearly Ukraine is committed to this attack.
*03:28.620- 03:35.980* :  We've seen a lot of elite-looking soldiers going back and forth and the signs are today that they
*03:35.980- 03:41.460* :  are continuing to expand their occupation of Russian territory. There are advances in the north
*03:41.460- 03:46.780* :  west to lead the reaction and with evacuations ordered in Bielgorod. It's showing that they are
*03:47.220- 03:53.260* :  committed to it and the signs are also that Russia is redeploying forces, notably from Kupianisk
*03:53.740- 03:59.780* :  and the northern part of the front line. But there are still Russian advances taking place
*04:00.480- 04:07.460* :  in eastern Ukraine and this is still a high-stakes move because the Ukraine will be home to
*04:07.460- 04:11.560* :  keep hold of some territory. You would imagine you imagine Ukraine will be hoping to draw as many
*04:11.560- 04:18.260* :  Russian forces as possible. They have sustained losses. There is going to be heavy fighting ahead
*04:18.460- 04:23.600* :  and if the front lines were to collapse, for inside Ukrainian territory, then that would obviously
*04:23.600- 04:30.180* :  be catastrophic for Kiev. And James, you mentioned the fact that this might be a way of just trying
*04:30.180- 04:36.500* :  to draw Russian forces away from some of the front lines in Ukraine, whether advancing.
*04:37.260- 04:43.320* :  Presumably, the Russian forces will reallocate resources where they need to and perhaps
*04:43.320- 04:46.700* :  then push back the Ukrainians. So what's the long-term goal, do you think?
*04:48.200- 04:54.040* :  This is clear and I think this is an ambiguity, which is deliberate on the part of Ukraine.
*04:54.680- 05:03.260* :  At the moment, Russia is redeploying regular troops who are struggling, I think, in the short term,
*05:03.260- 05:10.040* :  to contain these morally Ukrainian units that are going in, which suggests how important
*05:10.460- 05:17.960* :  Kiev sees this operation. But let's look at a scenario. Say the Russians do contain the attack.
*05:18.120- 05:24.280* :  They're already digging defensive lines deep into the Kursk region. We know that a static battlefield
*05:24.280- 05:31.320* :  suits Russia. So if that were to happen and if Ukraine is just saying heavy losses, then it may well
*05:31.320- 05:37.140* :  have been a distraction, but nothing more. What Ukraine will be desperate for this to be is something
*05:37.140- 05:44.700* :  which really finally overstretches Russian troops and enables it to change the dynamic in any way.
*05:44.700- 05:50.780* :  But clearly, if we reflect on the week that's been, President Zelensky felt something had to happen.
*05:51.260- 05:56.600* :  He felt that there had to be some kind of counteroffensive. What was happening just was not working.
*05:56.600- 06:02.080* :  And it was putting the very future of his country and future Western help at risk. So this is,
*06:02.080- 06:08.180* :  to be frank, a rolling of the dice. But, you know, one military expert in Ukraine said last week,
*06:08.180- 06:14.120* :  he repeated his argument, this year will require extraordinary thinking to change the dynamic,
*06:14.120- 06:19.360* :  and that clearly is what has happened. James Waterhouse. So Ukrainian troops have been
*06:19.360- 06:25.560* :  pouring into Russia. Evacuations are taking place, and Moscow is sending in army reinforcements.
*06:26.340- 06:31.380* :  Despite this, Ukrainian and Kursk region, there haven't been any major protests against President Putin,
*06:32.040- 06:37.460* :  but after a succession of setbacks, could this change minds in Russia? We put that question to our
*06:37.460- 06:42.660* :  Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. It's a question we've been asked so many times over the last two
*06:42.660- 06:48.040* :  and a half years, right? We were asked it after Russia retreated from Kharkiv region in 2022.
*06:48.040- 06:53.300* :  We were asked it after Putin was on the back foot and forced to declare partial mobilization.
*06:53.400- 06:57.580* :  We were asked it last year, right? After the Wagner mutiny, when you had the Wagner
*06:57.580- 07:03.400* :  mercenaries marching on Moscow, Putin survived all of that, and the likelihood is he's going to get
*07:03.700- 07:09.400* :  through this too. What helps him this time is that in a way, the Ukrainian offensive plays into
*07:09.400- 07:14.220* :  his long-standing narrative that, you know, look everyone, Russia's under attack, Russia's
*07:14.760- 07:18.680* :  a besieged fortress, when in reality, of course it was Russia that invaded Ukraine.
*07:19.240- 07:25.080* :  For the moment, the people in the border town of Soldier who recorded a video message to Putin
*07:25.080- 07:28.780* :  last week, they weren't criticizing Putin directly, they were asking him for help.
*07:29.060- 07:35.160* :  But I think the longer this goes on, the longer you have Ukrainian forces on Russian territory,
*07:35.160- 07:38.860* :  the more pressure there's going to be on the Russian leadership. And I wonder whether,
*07:39.300- 07:43.780* :  at some point, we're going to see Russians joining the dots and thinking, you know,
*07:43.780- 07:48.960* :  just a moment, this special military operation in Ukraine, we were told it was supposed to make Russia
*07:49.500- 07:54.440* :  and Russia safer. But what have we got instead? We've got more NATO on Russia's borders,
*07:54.440- 07:59.960* :  Finland and Sweden having joined. We've got now Ukrainian troops seizing Russian territory.
*07:59.960- 08:05.960* :  There are almost daily drone attacks on so many Russian cities. Will people start to
*08:05.960- 08:10.540* :  join the dots and think this is because of the decision of one man two and a half years ago to
*08:10.540- 08:15.920* :  launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine? Steve Rosenberg. And as we record this podcast,
*08:15.920- 08:21.720* :  President Putin has said Ukraine's incursion is aimed at trying to improve its future negotiating
*08:22.300- 08:27.240* :  position. Speaking of a Russian security council meeting, he said Russia will respond to the attack
*08:27.240- 08:32.060* :  and that the Russian army must dislodge Ukrainians from the border region.
*08:34.000- 08:39.600* :  Greece's most severe wildfire this year is approaching the northern outskirts of the capital Athens,
*08:39.660- 08:45.620* :  fanned by the wind, making it difficult to breathe and darkening the sky. As of now,
*08:45.620- 08:50.220* :  it's already spread to the Wooded Mount Pentele area near the city,
*08:50.900- 08:56.180* :  burning homes and properties. Emergency services are sending evacuation orders to residents,
*08:56.180- 09:01.520* :  but some people are refusing to leave their homes. Theodore Generos is from the national
*09:01.520- 09:06.260* :  observatory of Athens. He says he's not surprised at how quickly the fires have spread.
*09:06.820- 09:12.180* :  Greece is experiencing long-term drought. Even during the past winter, we didn't get any
*09:12.180- 09:17.420* :  significant amounts of rainfall and snowfall, and this has contributed to both increased
*09:17.420- 09:23.480* :  availability of dead fuels and now having fuels that are extremely dry and can support
*09:23.480- 09:27.960* :  the rapid spread of the fire and even the development of extreme fire in behavior.
*09:28.700- 09:31.160* :  Well, these people witnessed the full force of the fires.
*09:31.680- 09:37.640* :  The front of the fire is really huge and it is uncontrollable right now. We don't know if and when
*09:37.640- 09:44.000* :  the fire will end. All of the area that is burning here, it was olive trees, it was an agricultural
*09:44.060- 09:51.220* :  area and all of these are burned, all of them destroyed. Our reporter Charles Haveland is following
*09:51.220- 09:56.300* :  events. Marathon is a very well-known name, a very historic town, the side of the Battle of Marathon,
*09:56.300- 10:03.280* :  490 BC, the Theonians beat the Persians and of course it gave its name to the race from
*10:03.340- 10:09.720* :  Marathon to Athens, about 25 miles away, 40 kilometers. It is one of the worst affected places
*10:09.720- 10:15.560* :  at the moment. As you heard, the mayor is speaking of a biblical style tragedy saying our whole town
*10:15.560- 10:20.400* :  is engulfed in flames and going through very difficult times. Now it's not the only place,
*10:20.440- 10:27.900* :  there are apparently about 40 flare-ups of this north-eastly fire. The fire that has started
*10:27.900- 10:34.000* :  north-east of Athens and is creeping ever south-westwards, it's made more difficult by the fact
*10:34.000- 10:39.700* :  that the wind is so strong that seems to be more of a problem than the actual temperature
*10:40.340- 10:44.980* :  because it is causing the flames to change direction very unpredictably.
*10:45.240- 10:50.120* :  I was reading earlier on, a mayor of another town was saying that we're under control here,
*10:50.120- 10:55.140* :  but these other fires are popping up so quickly, it's really difficult for the authorities and
*10:55.140- 10:59.560* :  the firefighters. Yeah, some of the places that were badly worst affected on Sunday, for instance,
*10:59.560- 11:03.360* :  a place called Varvaras where that farmer that you heard from talking about his olive trees,
*11:03.440- 11:08.500* :  that seems to be slightly less bad now. It seems to be creeping in a south-eastly direction.
*11:08.500- 11:13.580* :  We're talking about a large portion of this east Attica province being at risk, which is the area
*11:13.580- 11:19.000* :  entirely to the east of Athens forming the point of a peninsula. And the main ways in which
*11:19.000- 11:23.300* :  this is being tackled are through evacuations and if you look at social media, you look at Twitter,
*11:23.800- 11:27.940* :  the Greek emergency services keep telling people of different communities evacuate here or
*11:28.160- 11:33.260* :  evacuate there. So the marathon people have gone to the coast, but of course the situation can
*11:33.260- 11:39.080* :  change because nowhere seems to be out of danger. Charles Havelet. To France now, where the
*11:39.080- 11:44.020* :  Paris Olympics have come to a close after what many people consider to be a very successful games,
*11:44.660- 11:48.040* :  President Emmanuel Macron has spoken to volunteers and organizers.
*11:49.340- 11:55.020* :  You did it. You turned the games into a moment of
*11:57.560- 12:02.340* :  an incredible achievement, a true and extraordinary moment,
*12:04.140- 12:07.220* :  which captured the imaginations of the whole country, indeed the whole world,
*12:07.220- 12:11.600* :  turning this event into a huge popular success.
*12:13.160- 12:17.000* :  I asked our Paris correspondent, Andrew Harding, whether President Macron's
*12:17.080- 12:19.940* :  excitement about the games is shared by the people of France.
*12:20.480- 12:25.820* :  It is, I think overwhelmingly, Macron touched on the doubters, the many doubters who thought
*12:26.420- 12:31.420* :  that France wasn't ready that it was too ambitious in its plans for these games and just the
*12:31.420- 12:37.380* :  general sort of French shrug of skepticism that's such a common feature of life here. He said,
*12:37.900- 12:43.520* :  we proved the doubters wrong that this was a triumph of a games. And I think, you know, I speak to a
*12:43.520- 12:47.980* :  lot of French people who say, you know, who've gone on holiday during the games, who fled
*12:47.980- 12:52.200* :  Paris as they often do in the summer and are now going, oh, I wish we'd stayed. It was amazing.
*12:52.920- 12:58.500* :  Will Mr. Macron be able to bathe in the reflected glory of all this? Will he get a bounce with
*12:58.500- 13:03.220* :  the public, do you think? He'll get a little bounce. It certainly won't hurt him. First of all,
*13:03.220- 13:07.820* :  there's a break for a couple of weeks, then there's the power Olympics and then I think politics will
*13:08.940- 13:15.280* :  resume in earnest. And I suspect that very quickly, people will remember the political crisis that
*13:15.280- 13:22.420* :  this country was locked in in July with a deeply divided parliament and no real government and
*13:23.220- 13:27.800* :  a sense of frustration that really this is all President Macron's fault. He's got very low
*13:27.800- 13:33.460* :  popularity ratings and there are some very quick, difficult decisions that need to be taken and
*13:33.460- 13:39.640* :  some compromises that need to be found in parliament, which at the moment it's hard to see exactly
*13:39.640- 13:44.680* :  how those take place. So those are the politics in short term, pretty tricky situation.
*13:44.860- 13:50.940* :  What about the longer lasting legacy, if you like, of these games for France?
*13:52.140- 13:57.520* :  So I think France has shown that the games can be done in a different way. Things like the fact
*13:57.520- 14:04.660* :  that the River Seine is now clean. It costs a lot, but it is clean. It's swimmable and it looks like
*14:04.660- 14:08.600* :  that's going to be a long term thing. That's the first time in a century. We had the triathletes
*14:09.020- 14:14.740* :  swimming in there in the past couple of weeks. So there are some concrete benefits, but I think the
*14:14.740- 14:19.620* :  danger, of course, is that we always get swept up in the excitement and the glory and the drama
*14:20.160- 14:24.700* :  and the realities often a little bit underwhelming. But at least this time, there are very few of those
*14:25.100- 14:29.860* :  white elephant kind of stadia that were built that then sedempty. And that's often a problem with
*14:29.860- 14:34.840* :  the World Cup and with the Olympics. That's not going to be an issue here. Andrew Harding in Paris.
*14:36.100- 14:42.220* :  The leader of a Kenyan cult is on trial for manslaughter over the death of more than 400 of his
*14:42.220- 14:48.380* :  followers. Pauline Tangui McKenzie and dozens of other suspects are also facing charges of terrorism,
*14:48.380- 14:54.520* :  murder, kidnapping, and child torture linked to the discovery of a mass grave in a forest.
*14:54.540- 14:59.520* :  They've denied the charges. Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross reports.
*15:00.280- 15:04.640* :  Pauline Tangui McKenzie was brought to a magistrate's court in Mombasa, along with around 90
*15:04.640- 15:10.080* :  men and women who are also on trial for manslaughter. The self-proclaimed pastor is alleged to have
*15:10.080- 15:14.980* :  incited his followers and their children to staff to death. Former members of the cult have
*15:14.980- 15:19.100* :  described how they were given instructions to begin fasting so that they could get to heaven.
*15:19.100- 15:24.160* :  The prosecutor says 400 witnesses have been prepared. Some will present their testimony
*15:24.160- 15:29.320* :  as in private this week. The horror of what took place in Shakahola Forest led many
*15:29.320- 15:34.320* :  Kenyans to question why the police failed to intervene when there were clear warnings about
*15:34.320- 15:40.680* :  the behavior of the cult leader, Will Ross. Still to come on the podcast.
*15:47.940- 15:53.140* :  The Italian media are very exercised indeed about rumours that Madonna is hiring the
*15:53.140- 15:57.260* :  ancient ruins of Pompeii for her upcoming birthday celebrations.

*16:40.600- 16:45.160* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announced that
*16:45.160- 16:50.760* :  it'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:51.020- 16:56.040* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*16:56.460- 16:58.980* :  Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*17:10.460- 17:14.480* :  The anxious weight goes on. After the killing of the Hamas leader,
*17:14.480- 17:21.060* :  Ismail Haneer in Iran last month, will Tiran attack Israel? Well, there are concerted diplomatic
*17:21.060- 17:27.560* :  efforts to reduce that possibility. Washington has added some military muscle as a deterrent.
*17:27.560- 17:32.360* :  The U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the rapid deployment of a submarine
*17:32.360- 17:37.740* :  and aircraft carrier to the Middle East. I got the latest from our Chief International Correspondent,
*17:38.060- 17:44.980* :  Lee Zduzet. Two weeks, not just since Haneer's assassination in Tiran, but also the assassination
*17:45.680- 17:52.580* :  of a senior hiswala commander in the Southern suburbs of Beirut and in the immediate aftermath
*17:52.580- 17:58.860* :  of those back-to-bath killings, as you say, nearly two weeks ago, both hiswala and Tiran
*17:58.940- 18:04.680* :  vowed revenge. The Supreme Leader of Iran said it would be Tiran's duty. But I have to say that
*18:04.680- 18:10.580* :  over the past nearly two weeks, we've had the reports have gone back and forth. First of all,
*18:10.580- 18:17.500* :  we were told we were expecting a very sharp, a very quick reaction from Iran. Then we were told
*18:17.500- 18:22.940* :  the U.S. was putting pressure on Iran to wait and perhaps that there would be a ceasefire deal
*18:22.940- 18:29.080* :  and that would calm Iran. That would be a good reason not to retaliate and provoke a possible
*18:29.080- 18:34.040* :  escalatory spiral in the region. Now, the Israeli media are saying that the Israelis
*18:34.040- 18:41.120* :  are braced for a possible retaliation in the days to come. We simply don't know.
*18:42.900- 18:47.700* :  Lee Zduzet. Well, the under-right lying issue is the Gaza conflict to a certain extent.
*18:47.700- 18:52.820* :  And in a joint statement, the leaders of France, Germany and UK said that they want the negotiations
*18:52.820- 19:00.860* :  resume on that ceasefire. To what extent could that tension with Iran make a ceasefire in Gaza
*19:00.860- 19:07.460* :  more likely do you think? There's been these wars within wars ever since the October 7th rampage,
*19:07.460- 19:13.420* :  murders rampage by Hamas fighters across southern Israel. They are very much linked, but in some
*19:13.420- 19:19.960* :  ways they're on their own spirals. As I mentioned, there is a sense in which the United States through
*19:19.960- 19:26.420* :  intermediaries, Arab leaders have been urging Iran not to soak the fires that are burning in the
*19:26.420- 19:33.300* :  Middle East, wait and see what happens with this newest effort to try to get a ceasefire agreed.
*19:33.340- 19:40.200* :  We're being told that the deal is on the table, that there is a framework. And when they meet on
*19:40.200- 19:45.700* :  Thursday, it's another effort to close the gaps. The Israeli Prime Minister says he will be sending
*19:45.700- 19:54.100* :  a team. Hamas has not been so clear in its response. There's not a great expectation that the deal
*19:54.100- 20:01.260* :  can be done, but the United States is saying they are closer than ever. And that deal, a ceasefire,
*20:01.260- 20:08.940* :  which ends the war, brings the hostages home, is the best way to quell the tensions everywhere
*20:08.940- 20:15.720* :  else in the region. Lease to set. President Maduro Al-Venezuela is accused of unleashing a
*20:15.720- 20:21.340* :  campaign of terror following last month's election. Mr. Maduro and his supporters claim to have
*20:21.340- 20:26.380* :  won the presidential election, but the opposition says it has overwhelming evidence that it's
*20:26.380- 20:33.300* :  candidate won by a huge margin. More than 1,300 people have been arrested and dozens of people are
*20:33.300- 20:38.960* :  reported doing killed in a government clampdown. In a video posted on X, the opposition leader,
*20:38.960- 20:44.940* :  Maria Corina Machado, who's in hiding, urged Venezuelans to take part in protests next weekend.
*20:45.680- 20:54.080* :  This Saturday, August 17, we're going to take to the streets of Venezuela and of the world,
*20:54.080- 21:00.820* :  wherever there is of Venezuela. We will be there together, have confidence. This time it's
*21:00.820- 21:06.140* :  different, because we're different. Let's shout together for the world to support our victory
*21:06.140- 21:12.400* :  and recognize truth and popular sovereignty. Well, it's now being reported by the Wall Street
*21:12.400- 21:17.940* :  Journal that diplomatic efforts are underway in Washington to try to persuade Mr. Maduro to relinquish
*21:17.940- 21:23.420* :  power as we heard from our Latin America regional editor, Leonardo Rosha. Well, that's something
*21:23.420- 21:29.520* :  that's been talked about and now they seem to have information that a very senior member of the
*21:29.520- 21:35.600* :  Venezuelan government, Jorge Rodríguez, he's very close to President Maduro, that he's in theory
*21:35.600- 21:42.260* :  been negotiating with the US. And what the US is offering is to lift the sanctions, lift the
*21:42.260- 21:47.640* :  charges that they have against President Maduro and many of the government officials, drug trafficking
*21:47.640- 21:55.100* :  charges in exchange for a peaceful transition before his term ends in January. I think also what the
*21:55.100- 22:00.600* :  article says is they're offering sort of total amnesty that they're promising that they won't go
*22:00.600- 22:07.120* :  after him for human rights violations or for other charges when and if he leaves power.
*22:07.960- 22:12.580* :  With that they would negotiate with the opposition because of course the opposition say that they
*22:12.580- 22:17.720* :  have evidence that they won the election. They just lost because of fraud. And Brazil and other
*22:17.720- 22:21.900* :  left-leaning Latin American countries are also saying that they don't recognize the result.
*22:22.200- 22:27.920* :  And that's quite important and this article also says that the US is putting pressure on Brazil,
*22:27.920- 22:34.140* :  Colombia and Mexico because they have left wing presidents to put more pressure on President
*22:34.140- 22:41.380* :  Maduro. What we have here is a dangerous situation because you have more than 1,300 people have
*22:41.380- 22:47.260* :  been arrested since the elections two weeks ago. Many people have been killed and you have a
*22:47.480- 22:51.960* :  situation where the opposition is claiming victory. President Maduro's victory hasn't been
*22:51.960- 22:58.720* :  recognized by many countries. He had Cuba, Iran, Russia and a few others and really there's
*22:58.720- 23:05.180* :  a possibility of change here. So what Brazil has told President Maduro according to the
*23:05.180- 23:10.380* :  Brazilian media, reliable sources is that unless he published a breakdown, a detailed breakdown
*23:10.380- 23:15.440* :  of the vote, they won't recognize him as the winner of the election. That's quite important.
*23:15.440- 23:17.460* :  That's a big pressure on President Maduro.
*23:18.020- 23:24.040* :  Lenado, Russia, speaking to Jackie Leonard. The war in Sudan is driving hundreds of thousands
*23:24.040- 23:30.560* :  of people to flee to eastern Chad. But life in the refugee camps is very tough. There's not
*23:30.560- 23:36.640* :  enough food often and shelter or medical help. It's hard to find. The BBC's Paul and G
*23:36.640- 23:43.000* :  and producer Michelin Bondo visited the Fachana camp which hosts more than 40,000 people,
*23:43.380- 23:47.620* :  not far from the border with Sudan. They spoke to refugees who are planning to move
*23:47.660- 23:54.540* :  on, not back home, but to Europe using the perilous route through the Sahara Desert where many
*23:54.540- 24:01.780* :  people have been abducted or killed in recent years. In Chad's eastern settlement of Fashana
*24:02.400- 24:08.080* :  lies a rocky and vastly barren sanctuary for Sudanese refugees who have fled two separate
*24:08.080- 24:15.060* :  areas of war. That's where we meet Mariam Hussein and her 20-year-old son Ahmed, who occupy a
*24:15.060- 24:24.300* :  small tapolin hut, fenced with a straw. Each passing day in the camp, Mariam leaves with the
*24:24.300- 24:30.420* :  trauma of not knowing the whereabouts of her eldest son Muhammad. He risked his life seven years ago,
*24:30.460- 24:37.140* :  trekking to Europe through the Sahara Desert, only to end up being kidnapped twice in Libya.
*24:37.800- 24:44.100* :  She shows me a picture of Muhammad on her phone. He's standing on a lush surface, wearing a blue
*24:44.100- 24:50.740* :  shirt, over a pair of black trousers. Tears pour from her eyes, as she tells me about the last
*24:50.740- 24:58.840* :  conversation she had with him. He said, it was important to cross because without crossing,
*24:58.860- 25:06.780* :  we can't do anything. That's the last thing he said to me. I feel so bad about my son's situation
*25:07.500- 25:16.100* :  why I didn't hear any news from him. I couldn't eat or drink anything. Mariam's nightmare isn't over yet.
*25:17.040- 25:22.800* :  Her younger son Ahmed now plans to follow in his brother's footsteps by making a similar trek to
*25:22.800- 25:28.500* :  Europe via the perilous Sahara Desert. But why does he want to leave this camp so badly?
*25:32.460- 25:37.660* :  When we were in Sudan, I attended university where I could dream about my future. But because of the war,
*25:37.980- 25:42.920* :  I lost everything. And when we came here, there was no education for me, no opportunity to bring
*25:42.920- 25:47.880* :  income to my mom and myself. And living conditions are poor, so I decided to leave.
*25:48.300- 25:55.300* :  The international organization for migration says 161 illegal migrants died while crossing the
*25:55.300- 26:02.880* :  dangerous Sahara Desert in 2023 alone. But this has still not discouraged refugees like 28-year-old
*26:02.880- 26:09.880* :  Siddik who made three unsuccessful attempts at entering Europe illegally. He is prepared to try
*26:09.880- 26:15.180* :  again. The plan is on course and it won't stop because we can't continue living this way and
*26:15.180- 26:24.180* :  there is no other option. Between 2017 and 2019, the international organization for migration facilitated
*26:24.180- 26:31.400* :  the relocation of close to 2,000 refugees from Chad to France. Underneath a tree in the camp,
*26:31.400- 26:38.720* :  the UNHCR's Associate Reporting Officer in Fashana, Ying Hu, sensitizes the refugees on
*26:38.720- 26:43.480* :  alternative legal pathways and shares possible opportunities with them.
*26:43.860- 26:48.980* :  Here we have our instance and resettlement programme. Also we have this other regular programme
*26:48.980- 26:53.780* :  such as humanitarian visa, family reunification. We also have scholarship programme
*26:53.840- 26:57.760* :  for people to continue their education, the university education abroad.
*26:57.760- 27:03.620* :  But given the limited resources, she says priority is currently on life-saving assistance
*27:03.620- 27:10.340* :  for the more than 500,000 Sudanese refugees living in Chad. This leaves Ahmed and his friends
*27:10.340- 27:16.920* :  with little hope, making their decision to leave Fashana only a matter of when? Not if.
*27:17.600- 27:23.840* :  That was Paul and G reporting. The Geneva Convention's turn 75 today. The
*27:23.840- 27:29.260* :  conventions, which have been ratified by 196 countries, have more support than any other
*27:29.260- 27:34.480* :  international treaty. But they are under immense pressure because of current conflicts.
*27:34.540- 27:40.240* :  They specify that warring parties should treat prisoners of war humanely and allow visits
*27:40.240- 27:45.580* :  from the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC, the Guardian of the Convention,
*27:45.580- 27:49.240* :  is asking all countries to recommit to their principles.
*27:49.960- 27:53.780* :  Our Geneva Correspondent, Imagine Folks, talked to the ICRC's president,
*27:53.780- 27:58.780* :  Miriana Spoljaryc, and asked her first if there was anything to celebrate.
*27:59.460- 28:07.380* :  We have little reason to celebrate given the world around us and the immense suffering that we see
*28:08.100- 28:13.920* :  in so many contexts. Starting with Gaza, but evidently also in Ukraine, in Russia,
*28:14.840- 28:19.600* :  in Sudan, in Myanmar. No, it's not a reason to celebrate.
*28:20.260- 28:26.340* :  Some people question, given that warfare has changed so much since the 1940s, whether these
*28:26.780- 28:34.500* :  conventions are even relevant anymore? Look, the Geneva Convention's have been ratified by all
*28:34.500- 28:43.500* :  states in the world and all states in the world still agree to this consensus and have not left
*28:43.500- 28:48.740* :  the conventions. And this for us is important. It's probably one of the most universal agreements
*28:48.740- 28:54.880* :  you have still today and one that remains uncontested. Now, it doesn't mean that the law is not
*28:54.880- 29:01.340* :  broken and that doesn't mean that wars are not bloody. In today's times, it's even more important
*29:01.340- 29:06.620* :  to uphold these consensus because this is more suffering. Not, you said, obviously, that
*29:07.420- 29:12.080* :  not every country always respects the conventions. Actually, your statement
*29:13.040- 29:19.020* :  goes somewhat further and says, if we carry on like this, we risk losing this international
*29:19.060- 29:26.340* :  body of law altogether. No, the international body of law remains. But what we lose is faith
*29:26.340- 29:35.800* :  in its implementation. Every time the law is interpreted in a way to accept human suffering
*29:35.820- 29:45.300* :  and to accept the destruction of civilian infrastructure as a necessary means to achieve military
*29:45.300- 29:53.160* :  operations. IHR is weakened and we have to reverse that trend. We have to put the protection
*29:53.260- 30:00.760* :  of civilians up front. And this is why I'm using these 75 years to remind states that they have
*30:01.340- 30:07.140* :  to absolutely, given what's happening in the world today, declare the implementation of the
*30:07.140- 30:14.400* :  Geneva conventions, their foreign policy and security priority. Can you do your job effectively,
*30:14.400- 30:21.180* :  though, given the current climate? Our job is immensely difficult, immensely complex and
*30:21.180- 30:28.240* :  immensely dangerous. We have had colleagues losing their lives in the past months. But we do succeed
*30:29.260- 30:34.700* :  in reuniting families every day. We do succeed in informing families about the fate of their
*30:34.700- 30:43.520* :  relatives. We do succeed in visiting detainees anywhere. I want states and I want everyone involved
*30:43.520- 30:52.660* :  in armed conflict to uphold the respect for international humanitarian law to protect humanity
*30:52.700- 30:57.960* :  and to never lose the possibility to come back to the negotiation table.
*30:58.380- 31:01.180* :  That was the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
*31:01.180- 31:09.540* :  Mediana Spolierich, speaking to Imogen folks. Rumors abound in the Italian media about the
*31:09.540- 31:15.440* :  upcoming birthday party of the pop singer Madonna. That it is, in fact, going to be held in the
*31:15.440- 31:21.080* :  ruins of Pompeii, a suggestion that has provoked more than a few tremors of anger. Rachel Wright
*31:26.940- 31:32.500* :  has more. It's on pretty much every Italian news site. The Queen of Pop has arrived in Liguria
*31:32.500- 31:38.220* :  on the French Italian border and is staying with their friends Dominico Dolce and Stefano Gabana,
*31:38.580- 31:44.080* :  the famous Italian designers. That's what we know so far, but what the papers are all a
*31:44.080- 31:49.580* :  gog about is the possibility that the singer has booked the ancient ruins of Pompeii to celebrate
*31:49.580- 31:57.200* :  her 66th birthday on August the 16th. More specifically, the Tietro Grande deli Scavida Pompeii,
*31:57.460- 32:01.480* :  the horseshoe shaped Roman theatre at the centre of the once bustling city
*32:01.860- 32:07.220* :  that was buried under four to six metres of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount
*32:07.220- 32:13.240* :  Suvia since 79 AD. The mayor of Pompeii has been quoted in La Republic at newspapers saying
*32:13.240- 32:17.580* :  he's been contacted about the event and is happy to welcome the singer to the site,
*32:17.580- 32:22.920* :  which has been reportedly booked by an American entertainment company for $30,000.
*32:23.880- 32:29.520* :  Madonna's Facebook fanpage has announced it's preparing for her arrival and 500 guests are
*32:29.520- 32:35.240* :  expected to intend, possibly including her fellow American singer Katie Perry and her film star
*32:35.240- 32:42.740* :  partner, Orlando Bloom. Louise Veronica Chaconi is American born but her paternal grandparents came from
*32:43.180- 32:49.600* :  Italy. She's previously thrown birthday parties in the country, but this prospective party is the
*32:49.600- 32:56.060* :  first to be held in such an iconic location. However, not everyone is happy about Miss Chaconi's rumoured
*32:56.060- 33:02.880* :  plans. Michelle Campisi, General Secretary of the Italian Nostra Heritage Association, told the
*33:02.880- 33:08.980* :  London Times, why does Madonna need to go to Pompeii? Is there not a more beautiful beach she could
*33:09.180- 33:16.080* :  use? And for 30,000 euros it's absurd it's like giving Pompeii away. He said Pompeii, which
*33:16.080- 33:22.260* :  attracted four million visitors last year, did not need the publicity of Madonna's party and
*33:22.260- 33:28.100* :  accused the government of Georgia Miloney of aggressively caching in on culture. In April the
*33:28.100- 33:33.540* :  culture ministry published new guidelines on how heritage sites should calculate their rental
*33:33.540- 33:39.940* :  value on the basis of a site's size and the importance of its monuments. Meanwhile, Madonna has
*33:39.940- 33:44.440* :  not publicly commented on her plans. She is, after all, on holiday.
*33:47.360- 33:51.520* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
