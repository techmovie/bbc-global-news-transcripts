*00:59.060- 01:05.320* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 30 Niles GMT on Tuesday, August the 6th, these are our main stories.
*01:05.320- 01:11.100* :  Kamala Harris has named her Vice Presidential running mate. He's Tim Walls, the governor of Minnesota.
*01:11.940- 01:16.660* :  The president of Bangladesh has dissolved parliament to enable a new government to be formed
*01:16.660- 01:22.960* :  a day after the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, was ousted by protesters. Dozens of protesters have
*01:22.960- 01:27.460* :  been arrested in Nigeria for waving Russian flags at recent demonstrations.
*01:29.900- 01:33.260* :  Also in this podcast, Israel's biggest human rights organization
*01:33.260- 01:39.980* :  exposes the brutal treatment of Palestinian prisoners. Big tech finds itself in hot water
*01:40.340- 01:45.740* :  in countries half a world apart and it was a dream to one day take part in the Olympics.
*01:45.740- 01:51.660* :  But I never thought I could be an Olympic champion. We hear from the first African to win a
*01:51.660- 02:01.440* :  gymnastics gold medal at the Olympics. As we came into the studio to record this podcast,
*02:01.440- 02:06.620* :  we got word that Kamala Harris has named the man she's chosen to be her running mate
*02:06.620- 02:12.580* :  for her campaign to become the United States first female president. He's Tim Walls,
*02:12.580- 02:17.200* :  who's currently the governor of Minnesota. Well our reporter Will Verne is with me.
*02:17.200- 02:21.540* :  What are we hearing from the US then Will? Well we're hearing from multiple sources including
*02:21.540- 02:27.760* :  the BBC's partner in the US CBS news that Kamala Harris has made her choice. It is Tim Walls
*02:28.080- 02:33.560* :  the governor of Minnesota. He was actually the book he's favorite to be the pick. There was
*02:33.560- 02:38.920* :  some speculation whether it would be Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, but it is Mr. Walls.
*02:38.920- 02:42.360* :  So we're expecting that to be confirmed very soon. So tell us about him.
*02:43.280- 02:49.220* :  Well he started out his life in quite a normal way. He was a teacher. He's served in the army.
*02:49.260- 02:55.540* :  He's from a rural area. He first came into politics in the early 2000s. He's an incredibly
*02:55.540- 03:02.900* :  successful politician. He was elected six times into Congress from a very rural seat. And that's
*03:02.940- 03:07.400* :  quite a tall order because this where Mr. Walls is from, his constituency. This is the kind of
*03:07.400- 03:12.520* :  place that would usually vote Republican, but he won it six times as a Democrat. He then became
*03:12.520- 03:19.320* :  governor in 2019. And just recently he's become a bit of a social media phenomenon because he
*03:19.320- 03:25.960* :  coined this phrase just weird to describe Donald Trump and the Republican Party. And he said,
*03:25.960- 03:30.900* :  look, these guys are just weird. And this phrase, it might seem quite normal, but it actually resonated
*03:30.900- 03:36.080* :  with a lot of people. A lot of people that perhaps had become desensitized to some of the more
*03:36.080- 03:41.160* :  radical outbursts from Mr. Trump and his mega supporters. A lot of people kind of came crashing
*03:41.160- 03:47.060* :  back down to earth and thought, actually, yeah, this guy is a bit weird. So I think Tim Walls is
*03:47.060- 03:52.200* :  a good choice for Kamala Harris in terms of what we call balancing the ticket. Tell us about that.
*03:52.560- 03:57.600* :  Yeah. So balancing the ticket is when if you have a presidential candidate who appeals to certain
*03:57.600- 04:03.440* :  groups of voters, then they usually try and pick as they're running mate someone who appeals to
*04:03.440- 04:07.860* :  completely different groups because they're obviously you're appealing to as many different
*04:07.860- 04:12.380* :  people as possible. And Kamala Harris is actually often regarded as a bit of an elitist in
*04:12.380- 04:19.220* :  Washington. She's from California. She went to top universities. She is often thought of as
*04:19.500- 04:25.340* :  perhaps a bit out of touch. Whereas Tim Walls is your kind of every man, every day guy. The guy
*04:25.340- 04:30.660* :  you might kind of get chatting to down the pub talks in a very kind of normal, simple every day
*04:31.240- 04:35.360* :  way. Whereas Kamala Harris, as we know, is often accused of speaking in platitudes,
*04:35.420- 04:40.240* :  saying a lot of words, but not really having much meaning. Whereas this phrase just weird,
*04:40.240- 04:46.040* :  for example, that Tim Walls came up with, that's classic kind of very normal every day language
*04:46.040- 04:52.440* :  that people can relate to. He's also quite funny as well. He's got that kind of dry sense of humor.
*04:52.880- 04:57.300* :  And actually a few weeks ago, most people in America had never heard of him. But as I say,
*04:57.300- 05:02.640* :  he's become this phenomenon on social media, incredibly popular, especially among young Americans.
*05:02.920- 05:07.840* :  And of course, it's how it looks as well, isn't it? Well, that's right. Because Tim Walls
*05:07.840- 05:15.000* :  can appeal to voters that Kamala Harris perhaps can't. As we know, she is the first vice-president
*05:15.000- 05:20.880* :  in history, a woman of colour. He's a white man. He will appeal to those white working class
*05:21.340- 05:25.760* :  voters in the rural districts. So he's reaching a lot of groups that Kamala Harris perhaps
*05:25.760- 05:30.860* :  is less likely to reach. Well, Vernon, thank you. A day after the Prime Minister of Bangladesh,
*05:30.860- 05:35.480* :  Sheikh Hasina was dramatically forced from power, the country's parliament has been dissolved.
*05:35.480- 05:40.020* :  Student protestors had set a deadline for the move. They want a new,
*05:40.020- 05:45.920* :  interim government to be led by Nobel Prize winner Mohamed Yunus. Nahid Islam is the coordinator
*05:45.920- 05:54.460* :  of the student protest. We will not accept any other government than the one proposed by us.
*05:55.200- 06:00.280* :  We will not accept a government supported by the military or the fascists. Any proxy government
*06:00.280- 06:05.920* :  or government against the people will not be accepted. Lydia Silver is an activist in DACA.
*06:05.980- 06:11.800* :  She's wary of assuming that on its own, Sheikh Hasina's departure guarantees a brighter future
*06:11.800- 06:17.560* :  for the people of Bangladesh. I would say, of course, the achievement of yesterday was historic,
*06:17.560- 06:24.660* :  but it is only a primary achievement as of now. As of now, we are just free of lies, corruption and
*06:24.660- 06:31.760* :  fascism from one fascist regime. But it would be foolish to think that it's over because you see
*06:31.760- 06:37.100* :  there has been two ruling parties, political parties in Bangladesh, who have been playing musical
*06:37.100- 06:44.200* :  chairs with the people of Bangladesh. One regime leaves and just it gets replaced with a worst
*06:44.740- 06:52.020* :  and more bloodthirsty regime. So it's time to build an alternative. So this is not it. We have not
*06:52.020- 06:59.480* :  achieved exactly what we were heading for. It's a long journey, a country we're heading towards,
*06:59.480- 07:05.380* :  a country without independent judiciary. There will be back lashes for the short term as there
*07:05.380- 07:11.080* :  has been. But we have to focus on the long term and make sure the victory of yesterday is not
*07:11.080- 07:17.320* :  hijacked by the people from any parties, any opposition parties hiding and waiting for
*07:17.920- 07:21.480* :  the next in line to cause more suffering to civilians.
*07:22.300- 07:27.160* :  Kesar Kamal is the senior member of one of those opposition parties, indeed the biggest one,
*07:27.160- 07:31.280* :  the PNP, and Rob Young asked him what he expected to happen next.
*07:31.940- 07:39.220* :  No, what happened basically? Army Chief declared that there will be an interior government. And
*07:39.520- 07:44.980* :  yesterday evening, all the representative of political parties and Army Chief,
*07:45.440- 07:52.820* :  Air Force Chief and Navy Chief, they went and met the president. And they had a meeting in consensus
*07:53.500- 07:59.340* :  and following the meeting president of Bangladesh declared that there will be an interior
*07:59.340- 08:06.660* :  government very soon. So there is national consensus and a member of the civil society,
*08:07.260- 08:12.040* :  as well as the student representative, all of them were together and made the decision.
*08:12.600- 08:16.280* :  Will your party also be part of this government as well?
*08:16.280- 08:20.960* :  Yes, yes. So it's going to be some kind of government of national unity then.
*08:21.420- 08:28.220* :  It is indeed national unity so that the people of Bangladesh get the true test of independence.
*08:29.300- 08:31.420* :  When will new elections be held then?
*08:31.860- 08:37.420* :  The interior government yet to be formed. Therefore, it is difficult to say right at this stage.
*08:37.980- 08:42.600* :  However, the bond of the people are, it's got to be done as soon as possible.
*08:43.360- 08:46.600* :  I've been speaking to our correspondent in Dhaka Agba Hussein.
*08:46.980- 08:52.140* :  Things are moving very quickly and we have seen many dramatic decisions in the last 24 hours
*08:52.140- 08:55.580* :  and that in the latest decision president of Bangladesh, Mohammad Shahboud,
*08:55.580- 09:00.160* :  then he has dissolved the parliament. Because the parliament remains ineffective when
*09:00.160- 09:05.900* :  Sheikh has resigned and fled the country. So now it is inevitable that the new
*09:05.900- 09:11.520* :  interim government will be formed. But it is not clear who will be heading this government.
*09:12.200- 09:17.340* :  But the leaders of the student protest, they say that they are proposing the name of
*09:17.760- 09:21.940* :  Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus as the head of the interim government.
*09:22.480- 09:26.580* :  So it will be very interesting to see whether Mr Yunus will take charge or not.
*09:26.580- 09:31.480* :  But some local media, they are reporting that Mr Yunus has agreed to take the charge.
*09:32.060- 09:36.500* :  In the meantime, the army chief, he is in talks with the political leaders and some groups
*09:36.500- 09:40.860* :  to form a new interim government. Now, there had been a lot of looting going on.
*09:40.860- 09:47.120* :  Is the country calm? Not calm yet. But the protesters, they are not blocking the roads anymore.
*09:47.120- 09:52.620* :  What we have seen in the last four weeks. And many people are celebrating their victory
*09:52.620- 09:59.680* :  today. And in some places, we can see the violence, unrest and everything is going on.
*09:59.680- 10:03.760* :  Because more than 400 police stations were set on fire.
*10:04.220- 10:08.040* :  And police came under attack in different parts of the country. Many police officers
*10:08.040- 10:12.880* :  they were under hiding. And the country's main airport was shut for six hours yesterday
*10:12.880- 10:17.460* :  because there was no police at the immigration check post. So they had to close it down.
*10:17.900- 10:24.000* :  And the other hand, the people associated with Sheikh Hasina's Awamilik party, they are also facing
*10:24.060- 10:30.220* :  some backlash from the people. And in many places, the houses and properties of the people who
*10:30.280- 10:35.960* :  are associated with Sheikh Hasina's party were looted and they were burned. So it's a very
*10:36.020- 10:41.800* :  volatile law and all the situation. And many people, they think that it would be a very difficult
*10:41.800- 10:47.380* :  task for the upcoming interim government to maintain law and order and back normalcy.
*10:47.760- 10:50.420* :  Is there any evidence at part of the military on the streets?
*10:50.840- 10:55.400* :  Military is not on the streets, but they have several check posts. But most of the military,
*10:55.400- 11:00.340* :  they have gone back to their barracks. But interesting thing is that there is no government
*11:00.340- 11:06.360* :  in the country. There is a power back room for the last more than 24 hours. The military is
*11:06.880- 11:13.220* :  trying to sort out things, but they have not taken the charge. So as long as the new interim
*11:13.220- 11:17.460* :  government is not formed, there will be some sort of uncertainty among people.
*11:18.080- 11:24.360* :  Akbar Hussein, Indaka. Conditions inside prisons holding Palestinian detainees run
*11:24.360- 11:29.740* :  by the Israeli military and prison service amount to torture. That's the stark conclusion
*11:29.740- 11:35.500* :  of a report by Israel's leading human rights organization, Betsellem. The group says prison
*11:35.500- 11:40.520* :  conditions have dramatically deteriorated since the start of the war in Gaza last October.
*11:41.240- 11:44.800* :  Since then, the Red Cross has been prevented from visiting Israeli prisons.
*11:45.500- 11:50.580* :  Last week, the issue of Israel's treatment of Palestinian detainees caused a very public
*11:50.580- 11:56.000* :  row when demonstrators tried to prevent the arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing
*11:56.000- 12:01.120* :  a prisoner from Gaza. From Jerusalem, I diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams reports.
*12:04.880- 12:10.200* :  Chaotic scenes at the State Taman military prison last week as protesters break through the fence.
*12:12.320- 12:16.500* :  Far-right demonstrators, including members of Israel's parliament, were furious that
*12:16.500- 12:22.380* :  nine prison guards were being arrested. Israel, it's safe to say, is deeply divided over how to
*12:22.380- 12:31.360* :  treat Palestinian prisoners. Thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank have passed through
*12:31.360- 12:37.120* :  Israeli prisons since last October. Those who've come out recently say they were kept in overcrowded
*12:37.120- 12:41.800* :  cells routinely beaten and abused by guards and intimidated by dogs.
*12:45.060- 12:50.560* :  After October 7, life thought it had changed. I call what happened at Sunni.
*12:52.540- 12:57.920* :  Betess Hassan has been in and out of jail since the early 90s, charged twice with membership
*12:57.920- 13:03.200* :  of an armed group Islamic Jihad. He was already in prison without charge last October.
*13:03.940- 13:05.900* :  Nothing prepared him for what happened next.
*13:07.180- 13:16.100* :  We were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms.
*13:16.100- 13:22.940* :  We were tied from behind. Our eye is blindfolded. Beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face.
*13:23.440- 13:28.600* :  They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us
*13:28.600- 13:34.240* :  while beating us. Since October, Israel's prisons, some run by the army, others by the prison
*13:34.240- 13:40.100* :  service, have been overwhelmed. The number of detainees has almost doubled. Betsellem has
*13:40.100- 13:45.560* :  interviewed more than 50 former prisoners, almost all of them released without trial. Yuleen Novak,
*13:45.560- 13:50.800* :  Betsellem's executive director, says their accounts paint a remarkably consistent picture.
*13:51.700- 13:58.280* :  All of them, again and again, told us the same thing. On going abuse, daily violence,
*13:58.300- 14:05.300* :  physical violence and mental violence, humiliation, slip deprivation, people are starved.
*14:05.800- 14:13.380* :  The Israeli prison system, as a whole, in regard to Palestinians, turned into the network of
*14:13.740- 14:23.220* :  torture camps. The Israeli government rejects that description, but its far-right security minister,
*14:23.220- 14:28.560* :  Itamar Ben-Gavir, frequently boasts, as he did recently in Parliament, that on his watch,
*14:28.560- 14:36.120* :  Palestinian prisoners are treated much more harshly. But it's not just happening to Palestinians
*14:36.120- 14:42.700* :  from Gaza or the West Bank. Sari Huria is a lawyer from Haifa and is rarely citizen, arrested
*14:42.700- 14:51.000* :  last November and held for 10 days. It nearly broke him. They just lost their mind. Simply,
*14:51.000- 14:58.440* :  they just lost their mind. There was no law. Sari's offense, two Facebook posts which the police
*14:58.440- 15:04.500* :  said glorified the Hamas attacks of October the 7th, a charge quickly dismissed. But not before
*15:04.500- 15:12.280* :  he'd witnessed the horrors being meted out to fellow prisoners. They was hitting them badly,
*15:12.760- 15:19.360* :  without no reason. There was screaming the guys, we didn't do nothing, you don't have to hit us,
*15:19.820- 15:26.940* :  me, an advocate that have seen the word outside the prison. Now I am inside, I see another word.
*15:27.820- 15:31.580* :  We put these claims of mistreatment to the Israeli military and the prison service.
*15:32.000- 15:37.780* :  The army said it rejected outright allegations of systematic abuse. The prison service said it
*15:37.780- 15:42.960* :  wasn't even aware of the claims. As far as we know, they said no such events have occurred.
*15:44.260- 15:49.720* :  Israel remains traumatized by the events of October the 7th, but that, Yuleen Novak warns,
*15:50.100- 15:58.540* :  is no excuse for what's happening in Israeli prisons. October 7th was the worst day in my life
*15:58.540- 16:05.660* :  and the life of every Israeli I know. The trauma and the anxiety walks with us each and every day.
*16:05.980- 16:13.700* :  But to let this thing turns us into something that is not human, that doesn't see people,
*16:13.820- 16:19.980* :  I think it's tragic. But Selim's executive director, Yuleen Novak, ending that report
*16:19.980- 16:26.660* :  by Paul Adams. The Paris Olympics are bubbling up to a climax with the big track events now
*16:26.660- 16:31.880* :  taking center stage at the Park de France. Mondays saw the curtain fall on the last of the
*16:31.880- 16:38.220* :  competitions in gymnastics. Not though, before Africa won its first-ever gymnastics gold medal,
*16:38.580- 16:45.060* :  courtesy of Algeria's Kellia Nimour. She won in the uneven bar's contest on Sunday. Isaac
*16:45.060- 16:49.000* :  Fanon tracked her down and asked her how she felt after making history.
*16:51.060- 16:56.500* :  Thanks. I'm really proud that this is the first gold medal for gymnastics in Africa and I'm
*16:56.500- 17:03.080* :  very happy. How long have you been competing in the uneven bars in gymnastics?
*17:04.460- 17:09.940* :  I came to the club when I was four and I was still practicing from the apparatus, not only the bar,
*17:10.120- 17:14.740* :  and I've been practicing since I was four years old. And when she was a little girl,
*17:14.740- 17:21.400* :  expect that she would one day be an Olympic champion? It was a dream to one day take part in the
*17:21.400- 17:27.860* :  Olympics, but I never thought I could be an Olympic champion. Do you use to represent France and
*17:27.860- 17:32.900* :  you represent Algeria because of your father? Just talk to me about what it means to win gold
*17:32.900- 17:41.280* :  for your dad's country. I've been competing for Algeria for three years now and they've helped me
*17:41.280- 17:47.300* :  in my preparation, so I'm very proud to win this gold medal. And now that you are a gold medalist,
*17:47.300- 17:56.260* :  what will you do next? What's the next thing for Kenya? Right now I will go on vacation and afterwards
*17:56.260- 18:00.860* :  I will start training again at the end of the month of August. And my goal is now the Olympics

*18:15.840- 18:19.180* :  gold medal inspires people. I'm practicing gymnastics as good.

*20:03.260- 20:09.020* :  daily life. Elon Musk of X, formerly Twitter is notoriously happy to ruffle feathers,
*20:09.500- 20:14.360* :  most recently with his allegation that riot ravaged Britain is heading for civil war.
*20:14.940- 20:19.700* :  But the big tech bros aren't having it all their own way. In a moment we'll hear how Google has
*20:19.700- 20:25.920* :  found itself in hot water with a judge in the USA. But first, to Malaysia and a censorship row
*20:25.920- 20:31.860* :  between the Malaysian government and Facebook's parent company Metta. It's had to apologise after
*20:31.860- 20:37.500* :  taking down posts by the Malaysian Prime Minister. Irish to Asia-Editor Mickey Bristol told me more
*20:37.500- 20:45.020* :  about the case. So this case essentially started when the Hamas leader Ismail Hania was assassinated
*20:45.020- 20:52.260* :  in Iran last week. Following that, the Prime Minister of Malaysia and Wahibra him put on a note
*20:52.260- 20:58.320* :  on social media on Facebook and Instagram. He offered his condolences to the family of the man
*20:58.320- 21:05.620* :  who died. Also he condemned the killing. Also he called him my dear friend. Now after that, Metta,
*21:05.620- 21:11.880* :  which is a parent company of Facebook and Instagram, took down those two posts. The Malaysians were
*21:11.880- 21:17.500* :  furious and they called in representatives from Metta and demanded an apology and that's just
*21:17.500- 21:24.660* :  exactly what Metta has now done. I apologise for its behaviour. It's reposted those online comments
*21:25.960- 21:31.260* :  and it's essentially said there was some kind of error. That's why they were taken down.
*21:31.700- 21:35.700* :  So that's a bare bones of this story. And what's been the reaction in Malaysia?
*21:37.120- 21:42.760* :  Well, the Malaysians, as I said, were very, very angry because they saw this as the taking down
*21:42.760- 21:49.000* :  of a legitimate comment, which essentially falls under free speech. Malaysia is a Muslim majority
*21:49.000- 21:56.120* :  country and over the past decades, governments there have expressed their support for the Palestinian
*21:57.000- 22:02.680* :  situations. Something that they see is a legitimate cause to support and they think it's their
*22:02.680- 22:09.880* :  right to be able to express that. And so they were furious that Metta had waded in to this argument
*22:09.880- 22:16.580* :  by taking down what they thought was a legitimate comment. Metta considers Hamas a dangerous
*22:16.580- 22:21.480* :  organisation. That's how it describes it in a number of Western countries consider Hamas a
*22:21.480- 22:26.560* :  terrorist organisation. So that's why they take down, Metta takes down some of the posts.
*22:27.180- 22:32.840* :  But on this case, Malaysia thought it had gone too far. And indeed, there were human rights
*22:32.840- 22:37.460* :  organisations, human rights, watch for example, a few months ago came out of report. They documented
*22:37.460- 22:44.880* :  a thousand cases since Hamas attacked Israelis and killed Israelis, hundreds of Israelis last
*22:44.880- 22:51.260* :  October, a thousand cases since then when they thought Metta had overreached itself and taken
*22:51.260- 22:58.240* :  down legitimate comments in support of the Palestinians. So essentially this case is around free
*22:58.240- 23:05.060* :  speech. It's not about terrorism or not. It's about whether people have a legitimate
*23:05.900- 23:09.560* :  reason to support the Palestinians. That's how the Malaysians see it.
*23:09.920- 23:15.300* :  And staying with Big Tech, a judge in the United States has ruled that Google acted illegally to
*23:15.300- 23:21.240* :  crush its competition by paying tech firms to set it as the default search engine on their
*23:21.240- 23:26.540* :  products. Google has effectively held a monopoly over the online search market for decades.
*23:26.620- 23:31.240* :  Our technology editor Zoe Klyman says the decision is likely to hurt Google.
*23:31.820- 23:39.460* :  It's quite a damning verdict. A 277 page judgment which says it was basically spending billions
*23:39.460- 23:45.860* :  of dollars to make itself the default search engine on various products, including apples
*23:45.900- 23:51.760* :  and Samsung devices. And in doing so, it was pretty much cutting out the competition because
*23:51.760- 23:56.660* :  nobody else could afford to do it. And by making itself the dominant search app, it was also
*23:56.960- 24:01.440* :  hovering up all of that data from people using it, which enabled it to make itself even better.
*24:01.900- 24:06.760* :  We don't yet know what the punishment is going to be, but there has been talk about something
*24:06.760- 24:11.600* :  structural, structural relief is the phrase that was used, which could mean the breakup of
*24:11.600- 24:16.300* :  Google's search business. Now, it's incredibly valuable to Google. It makes an awful lot of
*24:16.320- 24:21.560* :  money out of search and also the related advertising around it. So I think if that were to happen,
*24:21.560- 24:27.660* :  it would be a big deal for Google and its parent company, Alphabet. We might also see a fine,
*24:28.060- 24:32.400* :  but in the few cases that we've had that we've seen in the past, it tends to be that they'll
*24:32.400- 24:37.020* :  look to do something that will be, I think, more dramatic, if you like, than something that a massive
*24:37.020- 24:42.220* :  multi-billion company like Google could just pay off and carry on as it was. It is going to appeal,
*24:42.220- 24:46.080* :  of course. Google says, basically, it's being punished because its search engine is good and people
*24:46.080- 24:50.400* :  want to use it. So I don't think it's quite the end of the road yet, but this has been going on
*24:50.400- 24:55.640* :  since 2020, the Department of Justice in the US is going after Big Tech. Now, there are also
*24:55.640- 25:01.660* :  upcoming cases against Apple as well and Amazon and also Meta. So I think we're going to see more of this.
*25:02.240- 25:07.840* :  Zoe Kleinman. Now, what's happening with the world's stock markets? On Monday, stocks in the US,
*25:07.840- 25:12.960* :  Europe and Japan plunged, partly because it fears about a slowdown in the American economy.
*25:12.960- 25:18.840* :  On Tuesday, Japan's stock market bounced back after suffering an historic drop the day before.
*25:18.840- 25:25.100* :  I spoke to our business correspondent, Marika Oy, in Singapore. Well, Val, you mentioned yesterday's
*25:25.100- 25:31.920* :  sell-off of the Nikkei 225 ending the day 12.4 percent lower. That was the biggest point fall
*25:31.920- 25:37.460* :  in history. So bigger than COVID, bigger than that huge earthquake that hit the nation in 2011,
*25:37.460- 25:42.940* :  bigger even than Black Monday, if you just look at the points. And then today, as you said,
*25:42.940- 25:49.040* :  the Nikkei 225 opened sharply higher. And guess what, they ended the day more than 10 percent higher
*25:49.040- 25:54.560* :  as well. And if you just look at the points, this is the biggest daily gain as well. So extreme
*25:54.560- 26:00.660* :  volatility, definitely not for the faint-hearted, but definitely a sigh of relief among those
*26:00.660- 26:05.520* :  Japanese investors. And people listening to this will think, well, why does it matter to me?
*26:06.500- 26:12.200* :  Well, what matters is that when one market suffers such a huge loss, as you could see,
*26:12.200- 26:18.260* :  it almost has a contagious effect. So, you know, what actually started was the bank of Japan,
*26:18.260- 26:24.120* :  the country's central bank raising interest rates last Wednesday to 0.25 percent, which still
*26:24.120- 26:29.740* :  is very, very low. But that basically propped up the value of the Japanese currency, the Japanese.
*26:29.740- 26:34.660* :  Yeah. And even though that's what the authorities wanted, investors started to panic because
*26:34.660- 26:40.540* :  it could actually have a huge impact on Japan's exporters. And then we also had that
*26:40.540- 26:47.600* :  U.S. jobs data on Friday. And that basically triggered the sell-off again. So that's why we
*26:47.600- 26:55.280* :  started seeing America, Europe, and Asia all having this sell-off. And at least today, this morning
*26:55.280- 27:00.860* :  in Asia markets, they have done okay. And now we're starting to see European markets
*27:01.300- 27:06.860* :  starting to trade slightly higher as well. So it might be that the global sell-off is cooling down.
*27:06.860- 27:12.980* :  But why it matters to you? That's because it could actually have an impact on your stock market.
*27:12.980- 27:16.740* :  And also, you know, the country's economy and of course, you know, companies, performance,
*27:16.740- 27:18.060* :  and so on and so on as well.
*27:18.680- 27:24.200* :  America, Oi. Nigeria's government has worn protesters. It is reasonable to wave another
*27:24.200- 27:28.840* :  country's flag. After Russian flags were seen at a number of anti-government demonstrations
*27:28.940- 27:34.000* :  in northern Nigeria. Dozens of people have been arrested. Russian influence has been growing
*27:34.000- 27:38.840* :  across the Sahel region of Africa. Our regional Africa editor, Will Ross, tell me more.
*27:39.300- 27:44.040* :  We've seen these demonstrations, these protests in several cities across the country.
*27:44.700- 27:52.200* :  In at least two or three states in the north of the country, small numbers of protesters have
*27:52.200- 27:57.560* :  been waving these Russian flags. Now, some of them have been, you know, denouncing the Nigerian
*27:57.560- 28:02.380* :  government with similar slogans that we've heard all over the countries, calling for better
*28:02.380- 28:06.640* :  governance and calling for the government to do something about the cost of living.
*28:07.340- 28:14.380* :  But there is a school of thought that perhaps that this is linked to the military coups
*28:14.380- 28:19.080* :  that have taken place in other parts of West Africa. For example, these states in the north
*28:19.080- 28:24.880* :  of Nigeria, border Niger and in Niger, the military coup took place a year ago.
*28:24.880- 28:30.500* :  And the authorities there have been very angry with Nigeria and the regional block
*28:30.500- 28:37.200* :  ECOWAS in West Africa for the position Nigeria took condemning that coup. So it's possible
*28:37.200- 28:42.840* :  that some of these people waving the flags are really having a go at Nigeria for that position
*28:42.840- 28:48.600* :  against Niger. But I think the Nigerian authorities want to kind of nip it in the bar.
*28:48.600- 28:52.060* :  That's why they've come out with a statement and all ready. It's quite a strong response, isn't it?
*28:52.220- 28:57.780* :  Yeah, very strong response. And they say that they've arrested dozens of people, including
*28:57.780- 29:04.360* :  also tailors who were stitching up these red, blue and white flags. And they've, as you say,
*29:04.360- 29:09.900* :  called it a treasonous act. But it just could be that the Nigerian authorities are just slightly
*29:09.900- 29:16.320* :  worried that if any kind of momentum got behind the waving of Russian flags and sort of pro-Russian
*29:16.320- 29:22.900* :  stance and against the West, because Nigeria is a key ally of the West, it could kind of snowball
*29:22.900- 29:28.520* :  and make these protests even harder to put down. We're on days six now. They haven't been
*29:28.520- 29:37.020* :  huge, but if they did snowball and if they became kind of more pro-Russian and anti-West, it might
*29:37.020- 29:43.760* :  pose greater problems for the Nigerian authorities. Will Ross, half the world away from the dramatic
*29:43.760- 29:49.160* :  developments in their homeland and expat community of Bangladesh's are wrestling with the hostile
*29:49.160- 29:55.540* :  reaction to their presence in a small Italian town. One Falconeal of the Adriatic Coast has made
*29:55.540- 30:01.280* :  a name for itself as a base for building a new generation of enormous cruise ships. To succeed,
*30:01.280- 30:07.700* :  it's had to recruit a 6,000 strong army of Bangladesh's to do the low-paid jobs that Italians
*30:07.700- 30:14.120* :  won't do anymore. Their presence in a town of just 30,000 has though sparked tensions that have
*30:14.120- 30:19.640* :  seen the local mayor attempt to ban both collective Islamic prayer meetings and the Bangladesh's
*30:19.640- 30:26.240* :  national sport of cricket. Sofiu Patitsa reports from Mount Falconeal on what happens when an
*30:26.240- 30:36.360* :  urgent need for cheap migrant labour collides with far-right politics. A group of friends playing
*30:36.360- 30:43.280* :  cricket on a Saturday afternoon. These players are all from Bangladesh, but we are thousands of miles
*30:43.280- 30:50.740* :  away from where they grew up. Believe it or not, the mayor has effectively banned cricket here
*30:51.240- 30:56.960* :  and it's come to symbolise the tensions that one small Italian town is grappling with.
*30:57.260- 31:01.840* :  If you were to play this cricket game in Mount Falconeal, what could happen?
*31:02.000- 31:12.840* :  We'd have to pay a fine 80 or 100 euros. You can't play. They say let's see your documents
*31:12.840- 31:20.620* :  and that's all. Why is it forbidden? They say cricket doesn't for Italy. I'll tell you the truth.
*31:20.620- 31:27.260* :  It's because we are foreigners. In her two terms as mayor, Annamariya Chizint has removed the
*31:27.260- 31:33.240* :  benches in the town square where Bangladesh is used to sit and railed against what Muslim women
*31:33.240- 31:39.340* :  wear at the beach. But then she took things to the next level. She tried to effectively
*31:39.340- 31:47.440* :  ban collective prayer at the two Islamic centres in the town. People from the town started
*31:47.440- 31:53.940* :  sending me photos and videos which were quite shocking, which showed a huge number of people
*31:54.280- 32:00.980* :  who were praying in the two Islamic centres. As many as a 1900 it just won building.
*32:01.760- 32:06.660* :  This is really unfair for other people because there are so many bikes left on the pavement
*32:06.840- 32:14.920* :  and loud prayers five times a day, even a night. So the mayor says the Islamic centres are not
*32:14.920- 32:21.260* :  designated for religious worship and she believes the Bangladeshis are degrading her town.
*32:21.660- 32:29.580* :  There is a very strong process of Islamic fundamentalism here, a culture where women are treated
*32:29.580- 32:36.400* :  very badly and are oppressed by men. Our history has been erased. It's like it doesn't matter
*32:36.400- 32:41.320* :  anymore. Everything is changing for the worse. People are saying what's happening?
*32:46.100- 32:52.700* :  It's early morning and I'm at one of the two Islamic centres which the mayor says is not authorised
*32:52.700- 32:59.980* :  as a place of worship and in spite of what the mayor said there are hundreds of men dressed up
*32:59.980- 33:07.840* :  for the celebration kneeling on the soft turquoise carpet. Bukonate who's from Senegal is one of
*33:07.840- 33:13.480* :  the leaders of the two Islamic centres. He sees the arrival of migrants from different countries
*33:13.480- 33:22.000* :  as a major benefit for the town. I'm from Africa, they're from Asia. We definitely don't have the
*33:22.000- 33:28.440* :  same culture but accept this culture difference. Why? Because it's a wealth. It's not a problem if
*33:28.440- 33:34.760* :  it's managed well but in the case of Montalcone it was not managed well. Instead the mayor exploited it.
*33:37.660- 33:44.340* :  A few weeks ago a regional court ruled in favour of the two Islamic centres and annulled the
*33:44.340- 33:50.200* :  town council orders banning collective prayer but in the meantime Anna Maria Chizint
*33:50.200- 33:56.340* :  got elected as an MEP and will bring to Brussels her battle against what she calls
*33:56.340- 34:05.180* :  the Islamisation of Europe. That report by Sophia Petitza you can hear her full documentary on
*34:05.180- 34:10.660* :  crossing continents assignment. And that's it from us tonight but there will be a new
