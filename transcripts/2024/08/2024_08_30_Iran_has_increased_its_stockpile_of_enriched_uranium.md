*01:33.600- 01:37.960* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Friday, the 30th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:38.600- 01:43.080* :  The United Nations Nuclear Watchdog says Iran is now close to having enough weapons
*01:43.080- 01:50.000* :  grade uranium for four atomic bombs. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a series of pauses in fighting
*01:50.500- 01:54.820* :  to allow hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza to be vaccinated against polio.
*01:57.100- 02:00.920* :  Also in this podcast, we go on a voyage of discovery on a riverbed.
*02:01.360- 02:04.300* :  I love finding keys because you instantly think what did that unlock?
*02:04.300- 02:09.780* :  This is a medieval key. It's got this beautiful, beautiful pattern. This is a little bell.
*02:10.260- 02:15.780* :  No wonder mudlarking and activity involving the scavenging of the banks and shores of rivers
*02:15.780- 02:19.180* :  for items of value is becoming too popular for its own good.
*02:22.060- 02:27.200* :  A key reason why the current instability in the Middle East is so concerning is the prospect of
*02:27.200- 02:32.680* :  Iran becoming a nuclear power. It's been six years since the United States pulled out of a deal
*02:32.680- 02:38.780* :  that reduced sanctions on Tehran in exchange for Iran agreeing to international nuclear monitors
*02:38.780- 02:45.300* :  visiting key sites. Earlier this week, Iran's Supreme Leader said he was not opposed to re-opening
*02:45.300- 02:51.020* :  talks with the US. Well, that would appear that were Tehran to agree to that, it would be
*02:51.020- 02:57.100* :  bargaining from a position of strength. And that's because the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA,
*02:57.420- 03:03.120* :  has just released some worrying assessments about how closely Iran is to producing four nuclear
*03:04.260- 03:09.440* :  bombs. I asked our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson, what more the IAEA have been saying?
*03:10.140- 03:15.440* :  As you said all looking quite worrying, it's saying that the big thing is the growth in the stock
*03:15.440- 03:22.940* :  pile of Iran's uranium. Back in 2015, there was an agreement with world powers which Iran said it
*03:22.940- 03:28.920* :  would limit its enrichment to just four percent or less than four percent. In fact, now it's
*03:28.920- 03:33.820* :  stockpiles significantly grown. According to this report, it's reached 60 percent, which is not
*03:33.820- 03:39.680* :  that far off weapons-grade material. Added to that, Iran apparently has continued to not cooperate
*03:39.680- 03:45.680* :  with IAEA inspectors, monitoring cameras which are vital for assessing what's going on at various
*03:45.680- 03:52.740* :  locations, haven't been replaced after being removed. And apparently Iran has continued to not
*03:52.740- 03:58.560* :  explain the origins of man-made uranium particles at two locations that hadn't been declared
*03:59.160- 04:04.580* :  as potential nuclear sites. Mike, we should mention that Tehran says its nuclear program is just
*04:04.580- 04:11.400* :  for civilian use. Indeed. Given that the Supreme Leader has said we are open to the possibility of
*04:11.400- 04:17.020* :  talks with the United States, and now this report coming out, which would suggest that Iran could
*04:17.020- 04:22.000* :  bargain from a position of strength, if you like, what chances there do you think of talks reopening?
*04:22.280- 04:28.480* :  Well, quite good, I think, because Iran's economy is pretty much on its knees, largely thanks to
*04:28.480- 04:35.320* :  international sanctions. So there's been, I think, a lot of effort in Iran to try and reopen talks
*04:35.320- 04:39.300* :  with the West, and that's why you've heard not just in fact from the new reformist president,
*04:39.400- 04:45.560* :  Masood Pezish Kihan, who has said he campaigned, in fact, in the recent presidential elections on
*04:45.980- 04:50.100* :  reopening talks with the West, but even the countries of Supreme Leader has said there are no barriers
*04:50.100- 04:56.800* :  to opening such talks. And the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog is heading to Iran. He hopes
*04:56.800- 05:03.560* :  quite soon to have talks. Mike Thompson. The World Health Organization says the Israeli military and
*05:03.560- 05:09.920* :  Hamas have agreed to several three-day pauses in fighting, and that's to enable more than 600,000
*05:09.920- 05:15.480* :  children in Gaza to be vaccinated against polio. Well, the vaccination campaign is due to start on
*05:15.480- 05:20.620* :  Sunday, in central Gaza, before moving to the south of the territory, and then the north.
*05:20.620- 05:26.300* :  Israel has said it will agree to an additional day, if required. The Israeli Prime Minister
*05:26.300- 05:32.140* :  Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that the series of zoned three-day pauses did not amount to a cease-fire.
*05:32.860- 05:38.980* :  Rick Pippercorn is the WHO representative in the Palestinian territories. He was asked if he
*05:38.980- 05:43.640* :  thought Israel will stick to the agreement to allow polio vaccination to take place.
*05:44.440- 05:50.180* :  Here in Gaza, everyone is on board. We've had these discussions with Israeli authorities,
*05:50.180- 05:57.820* :  and that's for us, mainly Koga and CLA, and there where we have agreed to what we call humanitarian
*05:57.820- 06:06.560* :  pauses, humanitarian pauses, for each zone three days. And based on our assessment and monitoring
*06:06.560- 06:11.180* :  when we need another day, we will do another day. Now, you ask me how confident
*06:11.180- 06:18.260* :  and am I in this? I think this is a way forward. I'm not going to say this is the ideal way forward,
*06:18.260- 06:25.840* :  but this is a workable way forward. Not doing anything would be really bad. We have to stop this
*06:25.840- 06:33.520* :  transmission in Gaza, and we have to avoid the transmission outside Gaza. And yes, we are
*06:33.520- 06:40.340* :  confidence, the big words, but we are reasonable, okay, with this approach, and everyone is planning
*06:40.340- 06:44.760* :  accordingly. Of course, all parties will have to stick to this.
*06:45.560- 06:51.380* :  Rick Pippercorn, the US and the European Union have both voiced concern over polio in Gaza.
*06:51.840- 06:58.720* :  After the first case, in 25 years was discovered in an unvaccinated baby. Julia Tumor is
*06:58.720- 07:05.340* :  Communications Director at the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees, UNWA, the agency in charge of
*07:05.340- 07:11.380* :  implementing this vaccination campaign across the Gaza Strip. During the war, which started
*07:11.380- 07:18.420* :  more than ten months ago, Andra has been providing children across the Gaza Strip with routine
*07:18.420- 07:26.920* :  vaccination. However, what happened is because of the velocity and severity of this war,
*07:26.920- 07:34.920* :  a lot of people had to move. And what that meant in vaccination terms is that a lot of
*07:34.920- 07:41.800* :  kids, especially newborns, have missed on their vaccination, including against polio. So it is
*07:42.140- 07:49.960* :  not a surprise that polio has returned to Gaza. What's really shocking is that it had come back
*07:49.960- 07:55.760* :  so, so quickly in just over ten months after it's been eradicated for the past 25 years.
*07:55.760- 08:02.140* :  The conditions in Gaza, a place that I've been to during the war several times, they're not meant
*08:02.140- 08:10.460* :  for humans. And so it made it the perfect recipe for diseases like polio to come back. People
*08:10.460- 08:18.400* :  don't even have soap or cleaning water. The first round, we're hoping to get to over 600,000
*08:18.400- 08:24.660* :  kids under the age of 10 in different areas, or the south, the middle areas in the north.
*08:25.460- 08:31.360* :  And with polio as I'm sure you know, you need to give kids two doses, but two rounds. So we're
*08:31.360- 08:38.360* :  hoping that we would also be able to have another campaign in the September. That was the Unrah
*08:38.360- 08:45.800* :  Communications Director, Juliet Tuma. Ukraine says one of its new F-16 fighter jets supplied by
*08:45.800- 08:51.480* :  NATO allies has crashed, killing its pilot. It was involved in an operation against a Russian
*08:51.480- 08:57.100* :  aerial assault. Our correspondent, Nick Beak, who's in the Sumi region of Ukraine, near the border
*08:57.100- 09:02.760* :  with Russia has more details. This happened on Monday morning when Ukraine had come under huge
*09:02.760- 09:09.540* :  aerial bombardment. We've known that the Ukrainians for the first time had used F-16 jets to shoot down
*09:09.540- 09:15.400* :  Russian missiles and drones, but tonight the news that one of the Ukrainian pilots, Alexey Mez,
*09:15.400- 09:21.700* :  known by his call, Sine Moonfish, was killed in that effort. The circumstances are unclear.
*09:21.700- 09:26.460* :  It's said that he wasn't hit by direct enemy fire and there's an investigation that's now
*09:26.460- 09:33.480* :  underway, but he, along with another pilot colleague with the call, Sine Juice, had traveled to
*09:33.480- 09:40.380* :  Washington as part of Ukraine's big effort to be given these F-16 jets, but now both of those
*09:40.380- 09:46.880* :  pilots have been killed in action. It's also a blow for President Zelensky. He personally campaigned
*09:46.880- 09:51.880* :  to get these jets for the past two and a half years. He finally got them, the first of them,
*09:51.980- 09:56.780* :  just a few weeks ago, and now this has happened. There were these warnings that the Russians would
*09:56.780- 10:01.880* :  target them and also crucially the airfields from which they take off. And that is why President
*10:01.880- 10:07.700* :  Zelensky has asked once again of his allies that they give him permission to use these foreign
*10:07.700- 10:14.160* :  made long-range missiles so that they can hit further into Russia. And President Zelensky says,
*10:14.160- 10:19.660* :  if he's given that permission, they can prevent these sort of attacks across the whole of Ukraine,
*10:19.660- 10:26.100* :  but also they're better prepared to protect these really expensive and vital F-16 jets.
*10:26.140- 10:33.320* :  That was Nick Beak. The UN Special Envoy to Sudan says there's still a lack of political will
*10:33.320- 10:39.680* :  by the warring parties there to end hostilities. Tom Perielo has been trying to mediate a cease-fire
*10:39.680- 10:44.980* :  for months, but said the fighting has actually increased. Almost half the population of Sudan is
*10:44.980- 10:49.880* :  now critically short of food and over 10 million people have been displaced there. In the
*10:49.880- 10:55.580* :  latest report, Human Rights Watch has accused the Sudanese army and the rival RSF of committing
*10:55.580- 11:02.120* :  war crimes, including torturing and executing people in their custody. The Horn of Africa
*11:02.120- 11:07.360* :  director at Human Rights Watch, Latisha Bader told the BBC that international investigations
*11:07.440- 11:14.120* :  were needed to hold those involved accountable. This is most likely only the tip of the iceberg.
*11:14.760- 11:21.380* :  We need to see concrete evidence that both sides are investigating these types of abuses,
*11:21.380- 11:26.420* :  but given what we've seen so far, that's unlikely to happen. So what needs to happen is ongoing
*11:26.420- 11:31.160* :  international investigations. Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross,
*11:31.160- 11:36.720* :  tell me more about the findings of the Human Rights Watch report. A warning, some of what you're
*11:36.720- 11:42.880* :  about to hear is distressing. It's looked at 20 videos of at least 10 incidents that have been
*11:42.880- 11:49.580* :  uploaded onto social media platforms over the last year, and it's concluded that both the Sudanese
*11:49.580- 11:55.500* :  armed forces and the rapid support forces, as well as the fighters who work with the RSF,
*11:55.500- 12:01.580* :  they've all been executing people and torturing people who they were holding in custody.
*12:02.380- 12:09.620* :  Also, lots of acts of ill treatment of detainees and one issue it looked at, the mass executions,
*12:09.740- 12:15.820* :  a total of at least 40 people it found who had been executed. Both sides, again, committing
*12:15.820- 12:21.340* :  these atrocities, but it said that was mostly the RSF that was committing that particular crime
*12:21.340- 12:27.940* :  of mass executions and horrific evidence of mutilating dead bodies. And it said this was mostly
*12:27.940- 12:33.440* :  by the Sudanese soldiers who were doing this, including a case where Sudanese soldiers
*12:33.860- 12:39.380* :  brandished the heads of two people who we assumed to have been RSF fighters.
*12:39.780- 12:45.300* :  And the extraordinary thing is that Human Rights Watch say that a lot of these terrible instances
*12:46.040- 12:51.400* :  were actually filmed by the perpetrators, so they're obviously don't fear any kind of retribution at all.
*12:51.520- 12:57.300* :  Exactly that. It's clear that it's a common occurrence these war crimes, because the fighters
*12:57.300- 13:03.460* :  appear to be so sort of blase about taking out a mobile phone and filming what is horrific
*13:03.460- 13:08.360* :  footage and then uploading it, not just keeping it on their phones. But it sort of says this is also
*13:08.360- 13:15.320* :  a sign that there's absolutely no accountability, complete impunity. So what's needed is not only
*13:15.320- 13:20.380* :  for the two forces to stop doing it, but also for there to be investigations to ensure
*13:20.380- 13:24.620* :  that there are sanctions against those people who are doing this or their commanders.
*13:24.620- 13:31.260* :  The US Special Envoy Tom Perriela earlier, it was saying that there's a lack of political will.
*13:31.880- 13:36.380* :  Is he suggesting perhaps in others that sanctions will create that political will?
*13:36.560- 13:42.800* :  It's hard to know you've had sanctions on some individuals in Sudan for years, and you know,
*13:42.800- 13:47.260* :  you could look at the international arrest warrant against the former President Umar Al-Bashir,
*13:47.260- 13:52.540* :  and that never stopped him from carrying out his excesses. It's difficult to know what is the
*13:52.540- 13:57.640* :  best way forward, but any pressure I guess is worth trying. But what Tom Perriela is saying is that
*13:57.640- 14:02.740* :  at the moment it's pretty clear that both sides are willing to fight on. We have also got, you
*14:02.740- 14:08.700* :  know, external actors who are siding with both of these belligerents. There has been some progress
*14:08.700- 14:14.520* :  in terms of allowing humanitarian aid in over the last week with aid convoys going in. But Tom
*14:14.520- 14:21.140* :  Perriela also said that there's still some interference by the two forces stopping aid going in.
*14:21.140- 14:25.840* :  And we've heard accusations over the last year that the Sudanese Army and the RSF are using
*14:25.840- 14:33.840* :  starvation as a weapon of war. Well, Ross. Still to come, the fish were washed down this
*14:33.840- 14:39.820* :  quite small river into the port of Volos and into the sea. How a harbour full of dead fish in a
*14:39.820- 14:52.800* :  Greek town could end up in a lawsuit. Hey, prime members, are you tired of ads interfering

*16:05.160- 16:10.560* :  The US Army has criticized the conduct of members of the campaign team of the former US President
*16:10.560- 16:17.080* :  Donald Trump during a visit to the Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. The Army said the incident
*16:17.080- 16:22.560* :  was reported to the police. Tom Bateman reports from Washington. The use of Arlington Cemetery
*16:22.560- 16:27.660* :  for political campaigning is prohibited. And Mr Trump's team was reportedly warned in advance
*16:27.660- 16:33.160* :  it could not film or take photos in what's known as section 60 where troops killed fighting
*16:33.160- 16:38.020* :  in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. The Army says during Mr Trump's visit on Monday,
*16:38.020- 16:43.920* :  a cemetery employee tried to ensure the rules were adhered to but was abruptly pushed aside.
*16:43.920- 16:49.160* :  Mr Trump's campaign has vigorously contested the claim accusing what it called an unnamed
*16:49.160- 16:54.360* :  individual suffering from a mental health episode of trying to block members of his team.
*16:54.980- 17:01.960* :  Tom Bateman Wind has emerged as one of the leading sources of renewable power generation with
*17:01.960- 17:07.860* :  thousands of turbines being erected around the world both onshore and offshore. Well on Thursday
*17:07.860- 17:14.260* :  Britain's biggest onshore wind parks on one of the Shetland Islands in the North Sea has come
*17:14.260- 17:18.540* :  on stream. It could under the right weather conditions generate enough electricity to provide
*17:18.540- 17:26.540* :  power for half a million homes. $1.25 billion has been spent on the more than 100 turbines and
*17:26.540- 17:32.980* :  cable to send power to mainland Scotland 170 kilometers away. But it is raising questions about
*17:33.320- 17:37.680* :  how easy the switch to renewable energy will be as James Cook reports.
*17:39.940- 17:43.560* :  I'm in the centre of Shetland's biggest island looking out over a rugged
*17:43.560- 17:49.600* :  blustery murland of green and brown dotted with the odd purple thistle and on the horizon are
*17:49.600- 17:55.360* :  dozens of towering white wind turbines, their blades slicing through the sky and their tips
*17:55.360- 18:02.200* :  actually disappearing into the low cloud that hangs over the land. They're part of the Viking
*18:02.200- 18:08.800* :  wind farm which at full capacity can generate almost 50 times as much energy as Shetland itself
*18:08.940- 18:19.200* :  actually needs. We drive up to the turbines with Alistair Phillips Davis, chief executive of the
*18:19.200- 18:24.700* :  operator SSE. Shetland's got great wind resource. This is the first of the really big wind farms
*18:24.700- 18:28.580* :  that may be built here. There'll be more projects to come. If we think about the targets,
*18:28.580- 18:33.980* :  the government have set for 2030, we need to do a lot more of these projects, a lot more offshore
*18:33.980- 18:38.600* :  wind projects as well to make sure that we can decarbonise the energy system but also importantly
*18:38.600- 18:44.320* :  get security to supply. So does that mean that people will have to be prepared for more of the
*18:44.320- 18:51.000* :  countryside to look like this? I think so but equally we're here to consult on that.
*18:51.260- 19:00.500* :  To get Vikings electricity to the British grid, SSE has built a 160 mile long undersea cable
*19:00.500- 19:08.700* :  from Shetland to Norsehead near Wick on the Scottish mainland. Viking is far from the only
*19:08.700- 19:14.600* :  renewable project now feeding into the grid but carrying all this power through Scotland and into
*19:14.600- 19:20.680* :  England and Wales comes at a cost more and bigger pylons marching across the land.
*19:21.760- 19:27.020* :  I'm back on the mainland now in Aberdeenshire where I can see purple heather on the mountains,
*19:27.100- 19:33.320* :  green trees and the forests and the yellow of the wheat and barley shimmering in the fields.
*19:33.340- 19:38.640* :  This land can't have changed much since Lewis's classic Gibbon described it in his classic novel
*19:38.640- 19:44.540* :  Sunset Song around a century ago but it has changed a little on the ridge above me
*19:44.620- 19:51.000* :  there are wind turbines spinning around and people who live here are worried about what might come
*19:57.920- 20:04.140* :  next. At the Glenvervy show Kate Matthews is campaigning against plans to erect pylons in Aberdeenshire
*20:04.360- 20:09.600* :  and Angus. We're hugely worried about the industrialisation of our countryside. We live in one of
*20:09.600- 20:13.540* :  the most beautiful parts of the world and we're looking at thousands of acres being taken up with
*20:13.540- 20:19.540* :  essentially industrial projects. The rest of the UK doesn't know what's coming. That report was by
*20:19.540- 20:25.840* :  James Cook. Dozens of communities around Athens are still recovering from some of the worst
*20:25.840- 20:31.880* :  wildfires to hit Greece in years and now comes the long delayed impact of another environmental
*20:31.880- 20:37.940* :  disaster. A severe storm with heavy rainfall hit the eastern city of Volos last year sweeping away
*20:37.940- 20:45.100* :  roads and smashing bridges and the harbour has now been inundated with dead fish. People they say
*20:45.100- 20:50.780* :  they'll take legal action against those they say let it happen. Are Europe regional editor
*20:50.780- 20:57.000* :  Charles Havelin tell me more? Upstream from Volos there is a water body called the Karla reservoir
*20:57.880- 21:04.060* :  and the severe flooding last year which was one of a number of disasters recently. It meant that
*21:04.060- 21:10.680* :  that reservoir overflowed and the fish there were displaced from that and possibly from other
*21:10.680- 21:16.280* :  freshwater habitats nearby. Washed down this quite small river into the port of Volos and
*21:16.280- 21:20.780* :  into the sea being freshwater fish they couldn't survive in the saltwater but it seems that it's
*21:20.780- 21:26.460* :  only now that they have been washed back in. Don't know how far out they had got but Volos sits
*21:26.560- 21:33.220* :  on this large almost enclosed gulf of the IGNC called Pagaciti cos. It also seems that
*21:33.900- 21:42.060* :  dry weather recently has lowered the water in that reservoir causing further fish deaths due to
*21:42.060- 21:49.020* :  lack of oxygen and some of the fish may already have been dead when they were washed downstream.
*21:49.440- 21:54.460* :  And the argument from the people who are taking this to court is that the authorities should have
*21:54.460- 21:58.880* :  foreseen this they should have taken measures to prevent this from happening. It's not entirely
*21:58.880- 22:06.060* :  clear who holds governmental authority around this gulf which has not only Volos but several other
*22:06.060- 22:12.320* :  towns that are also tourist magnets with beautiful beaches but yes they are saying that for instance
*22:12.460- 22:18.320* :  some kind of net should have been placed over the mouth of the small river that empties itself
*22:18.320- 22:24.080* :  into the Volos port. The latest I've heard is that remedial action of this type is now being
*22:24.080- 22:32.040* :  taken as efforts continue to scoop these fish up. It's extraordinary I've read of 160 tons of
*22:32.040- 22:37.820* :  dead fish having been gathered in in the last few days and they are being taken off for incineration
*22:37.820- 22:44.620* :  but of course the situation there is an ecological disaster and also a health hazard because the
*22:44.620- 22:48.280* :  dead fish will be polluting the waters. I've read that the Supreme Court of Greece atop
*22:48.780- 22:55.980* :  court in the country has now ordered an investigation seeing the dead fish washing up at Volos
*22:55.980- 23:02.920* :  as a matter of great urgency. Charles Havelet. The hosts France have won their first
*23:02.920- 23:10.880* :  medal at the Paralympic Games in Paris, roared on by the home crowd Udo Didier won the 400m free
*23:10.880- 23:16.000* :  style swimming. China which topped the medal table in the Paralympics in Tokyo have again
*23:16.000- 23:21.780* :  started strongly with two golds and track cycling. The BBC sports reporter Shabnan Eunice
*23:21.780- 23:28.700* :  Julep was poolside at La Diffanterina and gave us our highlights. The swimming has gone underway
*23:28.700- 23:34.020* :  and the crowd have been sent wild here after front on their first goal medal in the first race
*23:34.020- 23:40.480* :  of the evening Udo Didier took a sensational victory in the men's S9400m free style with a time
*23:40.480- 23:46.440* :  of 4, 12, 55. World champion Simon Barlam had led the entire race but was overtaken on the final
*23:46.440- 23:51.980* :  length at a bite the home favourite so that was amazing to see. Earlier the first goal medal of the
*23:51.980- 23:57.140* :  Games went to Caroline Groot of the Netherlands while defending champion Kadina Cox of Great Britain
*23:58.140- 24:03.500* :  disappointedly suffered a fall and she had to admit she wasn't feeling great. She had MS and said
*24:03.500- 24:08.000* :  she only got back on a bike two weeks ago following injury and we've got a mention
*24:08.060- 24:12.580* :  another highlight of the day former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp has been here at the games
*24:12.580- 24:18.840* :  he was at the par at Badminton today to watch his friend of 20 years plus Voitek choose now
*24:19.400- 24:23.700* :  he was a promising footballer whose professional career was ended by a serious knee injury which
*24:23.700- 24:28.700* :  eventually led to an amputation and while he was rehabilitating he played a charity game against
*24:28.700- 24:35.240* :  Klopp's mains and they've been very close ever since. Klopp's been here supporting him at the games.
*24:38.500- 24:42.680* :  Now we're going to take you into the sludge of a riverbed in search of hidden treasures.
*24:43.260- 24:48.620* :  It's called mudlarking, scavenging the banks and shores of rivers and it is very popular.
*24:48.860- 24:54.680* :  Here in London keen mudlarkers scour the river Thames for objects that tell them about the city's
*24:54.680- 25:00.200* :  long history. It's now become so popular that the authorities have stopped handing out licenses
*25:00.780- 25:04.440* :  much to the annoyance of mudlarkers as Wendy Hurrah reports.
*25:06.340- 25:13.840* :  Each tide brings new treasure to the shores of the river Thames to be discovered by mudlarkers.
*25:14.520- 25:20.580* :  Lara Maklem has written three books on the subject the latest which chronicles a year of her
*25:20.580- 25:27.520* :  finds little things like the soul of a chewed a child's shoe. I love finding keys because you
*25:27.520- 25:32.680* :  instantly think what did that unlock this is a medieval key it's got this beautiful beautiful pattern
*25:33.120- 25:39.080* :  sometimes you even hear history this is a little bell again a 16th 17th century it would have
*25:39.080- 25:42.480* :  been tied onto an animal's harness so you could hear them coming through the streets of London.
*25:42.820- 25:49.720* :  This one's really special it's got tooth marks on it rat tooth marks from a very hungry Roman rat.
*25:49.720- 25:55.720* :  It's a nibbled game piece oh yes you can see that. Charles Dickens was sitting at a desk.
*25:55.840- 26:01.180* :  Duncan Hess has long shared this fascination. There's lots of little bricks in the pebbles
*26:01.180- 26:08.320* :  you know like what was that? Yeah exactly who built it who lived in it? Was it destroyed in the
*26:08.320- 26:14.820* :  fire of London? If you find an 1850 hate me was that person going to buy the latest edition of
*26:14.820- 26:21.360* :  David Copperfield or Oliver Twist or was it a six year old boy's earnings for cleaning a chimney?
*26:21.560- 26:24.660* :  I mean it might have been Dickens his own but he might have been walking across London bridge
*26:25.240- 26:28.700* :  and foolishly dropped a hate me in the river it's so romantic isn't it?
*26:29.420- 26:33.600* :  So finally with some time on his hands he applied to the port of London authority
*26:33.600- 26:38.920* :  for the mud-locking license one must have but was frustrated to be told
*26:39.940- 26:45.480* :  to protect the unique historical integrity of the Thames foreshore the ability to request
*26:45.480- 26:52.400* :  new foreshore permits has been paused. Then when I said so are you saying that people who have
*26:52.400- 26:57.460* :  already got licenses can keep them in perpetuity and no one can ever get a new one they cut and
*26:57.460- 27:01.800* :  paste the same reply and I phoned a couple of times and you know nobody was interested
*27:01.800- 27:07.480* :  it just strikes me as being very very unfair really. We've asked the PLA for further details
*27:07.480- 27:13.360* :  but none were given. Mudlocking became very popular particularly over lockdown it was a great place
*27:13.360- 27:19.640* :  for people to come and social media has snowballed since 2012 when I first started posting
*27:19.700- 27:26.400* :  more and more people have done it and I think they went from about 250 permits to 5000 and they
*27:26.400- 27:30.880* :  needed to put a halt on it just to give everything a little world settle down because when you buy
*27:30.880- 27:38.460* :  your permit you have a permit for three years. That may mean more licenses in future so new mud-lockers
*27:38.460- 27:44.820* :  can connect to Londoners that went before us for thousands of years. That report by Wendy Hurrell
*27:47.420- 27:51.220* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
*27:51.560- 27:55.660* :  if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an email
*27:55.660- 28:02.520* :  the address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk you can also find us on x at global news pod
*28:02.860- 28:08.740* :  this edition was mixed by Craig Kingham the producer was Liam Mccheffrey the editor is Karen Martin
*28:09.260- 28:11.200* :  i'm Nick Martin until next time goodbye
*28:20.140- 28:26.640* :  you've heard of Charlie Chaplin right well Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time
*28:26.640- 28:33.980* :  when he was the biggest star in all the world but something happened not just to him but to hundreds
*28:33.980- 28:41.640* :  of artists in hollywood they were forced to leave forced out all episodes of hollywood exiles
*28:41.640- 28:48.520* :  from the bbc world service and cbc are available now search for hollywood exiles wherever you get your
*28:48.560- 28:48.960* :  podcasts
