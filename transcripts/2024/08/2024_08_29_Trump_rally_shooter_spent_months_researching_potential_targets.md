*01:33.540- 01:37.860* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Thursday, the 29th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:38.680- 01:43.560* :  The FBI says the gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump saw the former president's rally in
*01:43.560- 01:49.440* :  Pennsylvania as a target of opportunity and had also carried out extensive research online into
*01:49.440- 01:55.620* :  Joe Biden. The Palestinian president has cut short a trip to Saudi Arabia as Israel carried out
*01:55.620- 02:00.320* :  its biggest military operation in the occupied West Bank for more than two decades.
*02:01.060- 02:06.620* :  France has charged the founder of the Telegram Messaging App as part of an investigation into
*02:06.620- 02:11.580* :  organized crime. Also in this podcast in France,
*02:17.140- 02:20.840* :  the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games has taken place in Paris.
*02:24.340- 02:29.600* :  If not for a slight turn of the head when addressing a Republican rally in Pennsylvania in July,
*02:29.600- 02:34.960* :  the bullet that skimmed the ear of the former US president Donald Trump may well have killed him.
*02:35.120- 02:39.860* :  Now, a little more has been revealed about the man who shot the gun. Among other details,
*02:39.860- 02:46.920* :  an FBI investigation found that 20-year-old Thomas Crookes had an extensive online search history
*02:46.920- 02:53.080* :  of a number of other political events featuring Mr Trump, as well as the current US president Joe Biden.
*02:53.660- 02:58.740* :  So how much has this all revealed about why he did it? I heard more from our correspondent in
*02:58.740- 03:03.760* :  Washington, John Sudworth. Well, we should have learned how little they've learned in a nutshell,
*03:04.180- 03:11.920* :  you know, with six weeks on from the shooting. They told us that they had trawled through years worth
*03:11.920- 03:20.960* :  of the shooter's social media and online postings. They heard interviewed nearly a thousand people,
*03:21.060- 03:28.700* :  family members, acquaintances, witnesses, and they had trawled through hundreds of hours of video
*03:28.700- 03:34.840* :  footage. But despite all of that, they have drawn almost a complete blank on motive. They say
*03:34.840- 03:41.200* :  there is no evidence to show there were any co-conspirators, no evidence of any foreign involvement.
*03:41.200- 03:49.180* :  It appears the 20-year-old Thomas Crookes was acting alone, but why he was acting in his attempt
*03:49.180- 03:55.640* :  to kill a former US president? They are no nearer to knowing. Given that they didn't have anything
*03:55.640- 04:01.760* :  earth shattering to reveal, why did the FBI give this briefing now? Well, I think two reasons,
*04:01.760- 04:07.780* :  firstly, in the most sort of mundane explanation is this was an update for the public that wants
*04:07.780- 04:12.980* :  answers, but I think there was also very clearly an element in the briefing given today that they
*04:12.980- 04:18.380* :  are feeling the pressure. There have been criticisms from some Republican politicians about their
*04:18.380- 04:23.800* :  handling of the investigation, their handling of certain parts of the evidence, and they essentially
*04:23.800- 04:28.420* :  used this as an opportunity to push back on that, saying that the way they've handled the evidence
*04:28.420- 04:34.940* :  is within line with normal procedure and practice, and also to make the point that they have not
*04:34.940- 04:40.120* :  dropped the ball on this. John, sort of why this assassination attempt took place, what motivated
*04:40.860- 04:45.900* :  it. The second major question people were answering is how on earth did it happen? And that
*04:45.900- 04:51.020* :  one imagines will become a little bit more clear and there will be more pressure on the secret
*04:51.020- 04:56.880* :  service when it does. Yeah, so and again, there was some additional detail on that today. We saw
*04:56.880- 05:03.820* :  the first photographs of the gun used by the 20-year-old shooter. We saw pictures of the backpack
*05:03.820- 05:10.280* :  he carried it in, the unexploded devices in the trunk of his car. That was all new, but we also
*05:10.280- 05:16.220* :  got a bit more detail from the FBI about the timeline that Thomas Crookes, they told us, was on the
*05:16.220- 05:22.040* :  roof for a full six minutes before firing the first of the eight shots. And of course, a lot of
*05:22.040- 05:28.220* :  the criticism has come on the secret service for its failure to respond adequately and quickly
*05:28.220- 05:34.260* :  enough. So some of that will, I think, raise further questions, but they also gave us a little
*05:34.260- 05:41.200* :  bit more detail on how events ended that day. They say that two shots were fired in return, one from
*05:41.200- 05:47.000* :  a local law enforcement officer, no evidence that that struck the gunman, and one other single
*05:47.180- 05:53.920* :  shot from a secret service sniper, a direct shot to the head that killed him. John Sudworth.
*05:54.600- 06:00.380* :  The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has cut short his visit to Saudi Arabia in response
*06:00.380- 06:06.380* :  to Israel's biggest military operation in the occupied West Bank for more than 20 years. At
*06:06.380- 06:12.800* :  least 10 Palestinians have been killed. Israel said hundreds of troops, the security agency Shinbet,
*06:12.800- 06:18.140* :  a commander unit, and the Air Force, are among its forces that have been taking part.
*06:18.140- 06:25.880* :  It described it as the most extensive counter-terror operation. The targets are four Palestinian cities,
*06:25.880- 06:31.880* :  including Janine and Tulkham. Israeli soldiers reportedly blocked entrances to some of them,
*06:32.200- 06:35.480* :  and gunfire and explosions were heard within refugee camps.
*06:35.980- 06:39.720* :  Our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson spent the day in Janine.
*06:43.400- 06:49.720* :  In Janine, dusk can be a signal to test the army's control. Explosions in gunfire
*06:49.720- 06:56.940* :  rose from the refugee camp here. Israel's army arrived before dawn in cities across the West Bank,
*06:57.580- 07:02.420* :  and still hasn't left. Hundreds of Israeli troops, backed by armored bulldozers,
*07:02.820- 07:08.760* :  took up positions in Tulkham, Nablus, Tubas, Janine, their refugee camps,
*07:08.760- 07:12.500* :  home to armed Palestinian groups, and unarmed civilians.
*07:13.600- 07:19.400* :  Mahmoud Najer said he was injured in Tubas when he opened the door to his house after some young
*07:19.400- 07:26.380* :  men nearby asked for water. We felt like something came down on us from the sky,
*07:26.380- 07:32.460* :  and there was an explosion. I was unaware of what was going on. When I put my hand on my chest,
*07:32.460- 07:38.480* :  it was all shrapnel and blood. Israel's foreign minister said Iran was financing
*07:38.480- 07:44.640* :  an army in groups in the West Bank, describing it as a war for everything that Israel must win.
*07:45.460- 07:50.740* :  David Mensa is a government spokesman. The IDF and our security forces are operating
*07:50.860- 07:57.460* :  in Tulkham, Janine, and other places from which murderous attacks have been launched.
*07:58.440- 08:02.400* :  We will fight to eliminate terrorism wherever it emerges.
*08:05.940- 08:09.760* :  In Janine, army vehicles surrounded the city's two main hospitals.
*08:10.560- 08:16.900* :  Ambulances stopped and checked by military jeeps. Outside Janine's main hospital, we met the
*08:16.900- 08:23.900* :  West Bank head of the Red Crescent, Eunice Al-Hatib. They are scaling up their operation.
*08:23.900- 08:32.780* :  When they talk about creating civilians and using the air force to bomb the camps,
*08:32.780- 08:38.780* :  this reminds us of Gaza. Israel has targeted the same areas in the same cities,
*08:39.280- 08:45.220* :  week after week for the past ten months, determined to dismantle the armed Palestinian groups
*08:45.220- 08:54.340* :  based here. This time is different, wider, more coordinated, and operation across the West Bank
*08:54.340- 08:59.700* :  on a scale not seen for 20 years. Lucy Williamson in Janine.
*09:00.520- 09:05.260* :  Jeremy Bowen has covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for 30 years for the BBC.
*09:05.260- 09:10.660* :  Tim Franks asked him to put the latest developments in the West Bank into the bigger context.
*09:11.380- 09:16.700* :  I think it is a big deal because of the scale of what's going on, particularly before October
*09:16.700- 09:22.880* :  the 7th last year, but absolutely since then, the Israelis have been pretty much constantly
*09:22.880- 09:28.180* :  raiding those areas. If it's not one of those areas, it's another of those areas. It was not one
*09:28.180- 09:34.620* :  camp, it's another camp, and that has been going on for nearly a year, hundreds killed on the Palestinian
*09:35.840- 09:41.100* :  side. But this is bigger because it's larger, it's coordinated, they're also specifically blaming
*09:41.100- 09:50.100* :  Iran for arming Palestinian groups in the area. So yeah, I think it is a significant step,
*09:51.040- 09:54.680* :  and I don't think it's going to do anything whatever to calm things down on the West Bank.
*09:55.040- 10:02.220* :  You mentioned Palestinian groups. How far is the picture in the West Bank just getting more
*10:02.220- 10:07.000* :  sort of fractured in a way, more difficult for the Israelis to control? It is very fractured.
*10:07.180- 10:11.640* :  What's happened in the last few years is that in individual camps, you know,
*10:11.640- 10:17.780* :  Tejaneen or in Tuvassal, wherever in those places, where the Israelis have been operating today,
*10:18.800- 10:24.740* :  local combinations of groups have sprung up. So it's not simply saying that this is a group
*10:24.740- 10:34.180* :  allied to the fatter organization or to Hamas. They have their own local individual alliances
*10:34.180- 10:41.100* :  and combinations based on the way things are in those places, which actually because of the fragmented
*10:41.100- 10:46.060* :  nature of it, I think has made it on one level, it's quite hard for the Israelis to keep track of it all,
*10:46.540- 10:51.920* :  but on another level, it's easier to isolate these small groups and try to hammer them, however,
*10:53.100- 10:57.760* :  you know, if you look, it just keeps on going. They do go in and out and they haven't succeeded in
*10:57.760- 11:04.280* :  stopping this sort of activity in terms of actual attacks on Israelis. There haven't been very many,
*11:04.280- 11:08.120* :  and of course, the Israelis would say that's because they've gone in. They've arrested thousands
*11:08.200- 11:13.460* :  of people and most of them are being held without trial on accusations that they might be terrorists
*11:13.460- 11:19.340* :  or suspected terrorists as the Israelis will put it. Beyond this, it's just worth reflecting
*11:19.580- 11:23.940* :  on how much the West Bank itself has changed over the last 10 months.
*11:24.300- 11:29.720* :  Yes, I mean, it's changed enormously. I mean, from, I mean, I have been going regularly to the
*11:29.720- 11:35.360* :  West Bank and I lived in Jerusalem for quite a few years in the 1990s. I've been going regularly
*11:35.360- 11:40.760* :  there for 30 odd years, it's absolutely transformed, but not least in the last five, 10 years,
*11:41.380- 11:48.100* :  has it been transformed more Jewish settlers is basically, and for every settlement or extension
*11:48.100- 11:55.660* :  to a settlement, there's an access road or a bypass, and so the whole thing is absolutely
*11:55.660- 12:02.200* :  chopped up, and with every road, Israel extends its actual control, it takes more land from the
*12:02.200- 12:09.320* :  Palestinians. So, you know, Israel is actively blaming Iran for stirring things up there,
*12:09.780- 12:15.020* :  as the foreign minister said, a new eastern front, as they call it, but actually, you know,
*12:15.020- 12:22.540* :  this is all about this long, intractable confrontation conflict, which goes back to the fact
*12:22.540- 12:28.600* :  that they cannot agree on ways to live together and split the land, and that at the moment,
*12:28.600- 12:34.980* :  the ultra-nationalist Israeli government has an official position that the entire land
*12:35.740- 12:40.580* :  from, as to use that phrase, from the river to the sea, from the river Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea,
*12:41.140- 12:46.740* :  is land, which is the property of the Jewish people. And Mr. Netanyahu, the Prime Minister,
*12:47.580- 12:53.640* :  has given administration of the West Bank, the governor, if you like, the effective governor
*12:53.640- 13:00.580* :  of the West Bank is a man called Betsellel Smotrich, who's also Mr. Finance, who is an ultra-nationalist,
*13:00.580- 13:09.840* :  ultra-religious extremist, who has essentially been making it much easier for armed and militants
*13:09.840- 13:15.160* :  settlers to go about their business, sometimes very often protected by the army. That's been
*13:15.160- 13:21.660* :  interesting today, that after a particularly nasty incident a few weeks ago in the, the village
*13:21.660- 13:27.420* :  called JIT, where there were some killings by settlers and a lot of damage, the Israeli army has
*13:27.420- 13:33.500* :  now said that it failed, that this was terrorism by Jews, you know, there's a sign there that maybe
*13:33.500- 13:40.240* :  this sense of impunity might be being eroded, but actually that is very vanishingly rare,
*13:40.740- 13:46.760* :  that they say something like that, because there have been dozens of lower level, but equally
*13:46.760- 13:51.620* :  distressing for those affected, attacks by militants settlers over many, many months.
*13:52.300- 13:58.180* :  Jeremy Bowen, the founder and chief executive of the Messaging App Telegram, Pavel Durov,
*13:58.640- 14:02.520* :  has been charged in France as part of an investigation into organized crime,
*14:02.520- 14:08.320* :  the Russian-born billionaire was released on bail, says at five and a half million dollars
*14:08.320- 14:13.920* :  and is not allowed to leave French territory. He faces multiple charges, including failing to
*14:13.920- 14:21.080* :  curb extremist and illegal content on the app. Durov has been in custody for four days,
*14:21.420- 14:28.080* :  Telegram has previously insisted its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving,
*14:28.760- 14:31.340* :  our technology editor Zoe Kleiman has more details.
*14:31.800- 14:37.240* :  Pavel Durov has sometimes described as the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia. He was born in the country,
*14:37.240- 14:43.340* :  but he left in 2014 and these days he's a citizen of both France and Dubai. The Messaging App that
*14:43.340- 14:48.160* :  he founded is called Telegram and what sets it apart from something like WhatsApp is that these
*14:48.160- 14:54.320* :  enormous groups of up to 200,000 people can share content and information on it.
*14:54.740- 15:00.100* :  Now the accusations that Mr Durov is facing are extremely serious and they include running a
*15:00.100- 15:06.400* :  platform to enable illicit transactions by an organised gang, failing to communicate with the
*15:06.400- 15:11.000* :  authorities refusing in fact to communicate with the authorities and complicity in the
*15:11.000- 15:16.780* :  organised criminal distribution of sexual images of children. Now he's under formal investigation,
*15:16.960- 15:21.120* :  this doesn't mean that he's guilty or even that they'll necessarily be a trial,
*15:21.120- 15:27.940* :  but it's absolutely unprecedented for the founder, the owner of a social network to be arrested
*15:27.940- 15:33.620* :  like this because of the content that's being shared on his platform and it sparked a really fierce
*15:33.620- 15:40.360* :  debate online about freedom of speech and accountability. Elon Musk, who's the owner of X,
*15:40.380- 15:44.860* :  which used to be known as Twitter, has left to his defence. He thinks that he should be completely
*15:44.860- 15:52.580* :  freed and he says that censorship is just moderation under another name, but the president of France
*15:52.580- 15:57.800* :  in Manuel Macron said earlier this week that France remained committed to freedom of expression.
*15:58.260- 16:04.280* :  Zoe Kleinman. Several countries in southern Africa have declared emergencies because of a drought,
*16:04.280- 16:10.220* :  which is devastating crop yields and has left many people hungry. A joint regional appeal has
*16:10.220- 16:16.100* :  asked for five billion dollars to cope with the drought. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka travel to a
*16:16.100- 16:22.020* :  community in the district of Moodzee in northern Zimbabwe, one of the regions worst hit by the crisis.
*16:27.060- 16:32.360* :  A community and their livestock gathered on a dry riverbed. The Womborzi normally flows
*16:32.540- 16:40.760* :  throughout the year, now it's bone dry. Armed with shovels and buckets, the men are digging a small
*16:40.760- 16:46.840* :  hole into the riverbed to extract the last drops of water. As rivers and dams have dried up
*16:46.840- 16:56.780* :  elsewhere, more and more are descending on here. Gracious Peri now walks further than ever before,
*16:56.780- 17:04.320* :  spending three hours of everyday fetching water. As you can see, the cattle are drinking from
*17:04.320- 17:09.320* :  the same pit as us. Their urine is right there. It's not very healthy for our families.
*17:09.340- 17:14.140* :  I have never seen anything like this. One of the worst droughts in living memory is
*17:14.140- 17:19.360* :  sweeping across Zimbabwe. Here in Moodzee, only a third of families in the district have enough
*17:19.360- 17:24.860* :  food. The community women each contributing the little they have are cooking in nutritious
*17:24.860- 17:30.520* :  porridge for their children. Beobab, peanut butter, vegetable and milk are stirred into the pot
*17:30.540- 17:36.060* :  to curb the cases of malnutrition, which have doubled recently according to the medical officer
*17:36.060- 17:42.200* :  Kunzai Madamonbe. With the support of partners such as UNICEF, we have instituted a village feeding
*17:42.200- 17:50.200* :  program. We wanted this small support to be given to all underfights at least twice or three
*17:50.700- 17:56.380* :  times a week. But because of the UNICEF's interest to drought, we are now only giving it once
*17:56.380- 18:02.380* :  a week. Because you don't have enough food? Yes, because the drains didn't come and we
*18:02.380- 18:07.380* :  classified 100% loss in terms of all the crops.
*18:11.600- 18:16.780* :  36-year-old Tumbled Zimbabwe had she planted acres of maize, cow peas and peanuts,
*18:17.240- 18:22.380* :  but got nothing. In a good year she supplies markets in the capital, but this year she's
*18:22.380- 18:29.200* :  among millions of Zimbabweans relying on handouts. And breakfast to date for her two children
*18:29.200- 18:37.840* :  is boiled wheat from a charitable neighbour. We've gone from eating what we want and when we want
*18:37.840- 18:44.760* :  to limiting meals. The older girl understands and accepts that we don't have enough. But at times
*18:44.760- 18:50.320* :  I can say that my youngest is hungry. It's a widespread problem with the rains having failed
*18:50.320- 18:55.500* :  across most of southern Africa this year. About a third of the region's countries have declared
*18:55.500- 19:01.660* :  a state of disaster and a massive 70 million people will need food aid. Thompson Perry is from
*19:01.660- 19:07.200* :  the World Food Programme. Three million tons of maize is required immediately to meet regional
*19:07.200- 19:13.620* :  demand. If you go anywhere in southern Africa, family granaries are empty and maize is now priced
*19:13.620- 19:19.320* :  out of many people's hands. WP is killing up to provide to approximately 5.9 million people
*19:19.320- 19:24.680* :  in the seven hardest heat countries. I can tell you we've only been able to raise one fifth
*19:25.140- 19:28.780* :  of the 400 million that we need to provide assistance.
*19:29.200- 19:34.520* :  October, the hottest, driest month of the year, is still a long way off, meaning that the regional
*19:34.520- 19:40.420* :  hunger and water crises will only worsen. It's something Tumbled Zai is acutely aware of,
*19:40.740- 19:46.620* :  as she cracks open some wild fruit to stave off the hunger pangs. I'm sure about what lies ahead
*19:46.620- 19:53.260* :  for her young family. That report by Shingai Nyoka in Northern Zimbabwe.

*21:33.920- 21:36.960* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. To Venezuela now.
*21:41.160- 21:45.960* :  Freedom, freedom, freedom are the chance from opposition supporters on the streets of
*21:46.460- 21:50.680* :  Caracas. They will respond to a call from their leader, Maria Corina Machado,
*21:50.680- 21:55.840* :  who emerged from hiding to address them. Standing on top of a car, she told the demonstrators
*21:55.840- 22:01.560* :  that the protests would not stop until President Nicolas Maduro accepts that he lost last month's
*22:01.560- 22:08.520* :  election. Our correspondent, Rachele Krieger, from BBC Monitoring in Miami, told me more about
*22:08.520- 22:14.640* :  Miss Machado's campaign. She is continuing to be pretty defiant, although she has said that she
*22:14.640- 22:20.340* :  isn't hiding because of government threats. She has kept appearing in some of these demonstrations.
*22:20.340- 22:27.000* :  She goes with a hoodie and then goes directly to the mobile stage and she gives her speech this time.
*22:27.000- 22:32.940* :  She said that the opposition would keep fighting and she made a specific appeal to the armed forces
*22:32.940- 22:37.260* :  which she has done before to side with the opposition.
*22:37.780- 22:42.840* :  And from the size and the atmosphere of this latest demonstration, what do you think that tells us
*22:43.260- 22:45.720* :  about the momentum of the opposition movement?
*22:46.420- 22:52.040* :  I think one of the big obstacles that the opposition has or the big challenges is to keep that momentum
*22:52.040- 22:58.660* :  going because it does seem like Maria Corina's strategy is more of a medium-long-term strategy,
*22:58.660- 23:03.780* :  not directly toppling the government right away but doing it through street pressure and more
*23:03.780- 23:09.000* :  of a prolonged period. I would say that's always been a challenge for the opposition and we've
*23:09.000- 23:14.460* :  obviously been here many times before with waves of demonstrations. So the fact that thousands of
*23:14.500- 23:21.160* :  people still keep showing up does appear to show that she's being able to somewhat keep the momentum
*23:21.160- 23:25.340* :  going but we obviously don't know how long that's going to last.
*23:25.340- 23:31.040* :  So the moment on the other side of the coin is the government and they came out with a new
*23:31.040- 23:36.220* :  hardline interior minister. Tell us about him and what that says about the government's position.
*23:36.640- 23:42.240* :  So yes, the whole cabinet reshuffle was seen and described by many observers as an entrenchment
*23:42.240- 23:48.780* :  of Maduro and his inner circle. I would say that the designation of the Val Cabello, a top party leader
*23:48.780- 23:54.580* :  who hadn't been in the executive power for more than a decade, his return to the executive power
*23:54.800- 24:02.680* :  does mean that the government is kind of trying to consolidate this firm hand and this intensifying
*24:02.680- 24:08.560* :  repression and this attempting to stay in power through force. Now that he is bringing him back,
*24:08.560- 24:13.440* :  a lot of observers are saying that Maduro is simply trying to survive and doing that by bringing
*24:13.440- 24:18.700* :  someone back who is going to help impose this staying in government through force.
*24:19.460- 24:25.540* :  Rochelle Krieger, with a new British government there have been questions about whether it will change
*24:25.540- 24:31.340* :  to UK's relationship with the European Union following Brexit. Now some of those questions might
*24:31.340- 24:36.140* :  be closer to being answered as a new treaty is announced between Britain and Germany.
*24:36.140- 24:41.080* :  The British Prime Minister Kierst Starrer told a news conference on Wednesday the deal would boost
*24:41.080- 24:48.280* :  relations between the two countries. A new UK Germany treaty, a once in a generation chance
*24:48.280- 24:55.980* :  to deliver for working people in Britain and in Germany, a new agreement, a testament
*24:56.140- 25:03.240* :  to the depth and potential of our relationship, with deeper links on science, technology,
*25:03.240- 25:09.880* :  development, people, business, culture, a boost to our trading relations.
*25:10.820- 25:16.840* :  The German Chancellor Olaf Schultz said the Covid pandemic and the UK's withdrawal from the EU
*25:17.360- 25:23.160* :  had caused a massive decline in contacts. He said the pact could help with a wider reset in
*25:23.160- 25:31.620* :  relations. It is also important for us to further develop relations between the European Union
*25:31.620- 25:37.020* :  and Great Britain. I'm delighted that Kierst Starrer has announced that he'll seek a fresh start in
*25:37.020- 25:43.080* :  relations with the EU. We want to grab this extended hand. So to find out what's been agreed
*25:43.080- 25:47.980* :  and what hasn't and what that will mean, I spoke to our political correspondent Rob Watson.
*25:48.400- 25:52.920* :  So what exactly is Mr Starrer's strategy? The agreement is in its early stages,
*25:52.920- 25:58.340* :  but essentially it's going to touch on the kind of things that are beyond the EU. So member states
*25:58.340- 26:02.720* :  like Germany, they're still in charge of things like technical arrangements, scientific
*26:03.800- 26:08.240* :  cooperation, all sorts of things like that. What they don't do is trade and economics. That is
*26:08.240- 26:13.580* :  very much an EU thing. So it'll be a bilateral relationship intended just to make the two countries
*26:14.020- 26:19.200* :  closer on things like a defence security stuff like that, cultural exchanges. What's behind
*26:19.200- 26:24.760* :  it? I mean, that is dead simple. This is the new British government repeating its message that
*26:24.820- 26:29.520* :  we want to be friends with Europe again. We want to look a bit less odd on the world stage. And
*26:29.520- 26:33.740* :  I think Britain did look to many of its allies under the previous Conservative government and to
*26:33.740- 26:38.800* :  send a message to Europe that this government does not see the European Union as a strategic
*26:38.800- 26:42.640* :  competitor or rival. Kind of test in the waters with these easier
*26:43.060- 26:49.480* :  bilateral agreements. But what about this long term goal of closer relations between Britain
*26:49.480- 26:55.480* :  and the EU? But we shouldn't expect Mr Starrer to reapply to join the EU anytime soon, should we?
*26:55.780- 27:01.020* :  Well, in the short term, no. I mean, he specifically ruled that out in Germany today. He said Britain
*27:01.020- 27:05.300* :  would not be rejoining the single market. It would not be rejoining the customs union. It would
*27:05.300- 27:10.800* :  not be rejoining the European Union. So, despite all these really nice sort of words and
*27:10.800- 27:14.960* :  they are meant sincerely, I mean, it's pretty clear that Britain is going to have a much more
*27:14.960- 27:19.720* :  distant relationship with the European Union that it had compared to when it was a member.
*27:19.720- 27:25.140* :  And essentially, Kiss Starrer is taking over much of the hard Brexit negotiated by Boris Johnson,
*27:25.140- 27:31.160* :  by which I mean, Britain out of all of the EU's political and economic institutions. But you
*27:31.180- 27:36.560* :  mentioned that word, long words, long term at the start, Nick. And this may change for a couple
*27:36.560- 27:41.580* :  of reasons. I mean, one is economic. Brexit is causing Britain a lot of damage, a lot of damage
*27:41.580- 27:46.300* :  to its economy. That damage continues. The second thing is that the previous government, the
*27:46.300- 27:52.080* :  Conservatives are firmly these days an anti-EU party and we're always under pressure from their
*27:52.080- 27:56.600* :  members not to get too close to Brussels. So, Kiss Starrer has the opposite issue. You know,
*27:56.600- 28:00.860* :  the Labour Party, Labour Members, Labour Supporters are very pro the European Union. So,
*28:00.860- 28:06.260* :  he's going to be under pressure both economically and from the party to be closer to Brussels.
*28:06.800- 28:12.260* :  Rob Watson. North Korea has to import thousands of tons of rice and maize from China,
*28:12.260- 28:16.500* :  adults, where to feed its people. But Pyongyang also imports something that certainly
*28:16.500- 28:23.460* :  not life-sustaining, rare Russian horses. The leader Kim Jong-un is very partial to being seen
*28:23.460- 28:29.220* :  as stride and eye-catching white breed. A big batch of the animals has just come into the country,
*28:29.220- 28:33.760* :  as I've been hearing from our Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Brister. Well, the bad bones of this
*28:33.760- 28:39.740* :  story is quite simple is that North Korea has imported two dozen thoroughbred horses,
*28:39.740- 28:45.820* :  they're known as all-off trotters from Russia. These horses were developed in the 18th century
*28:45.820- 28:50.860* :  by a Russian count. They're strong. They're beautiful. And as their name suggests,
*28:51.420- 28:55.140* :  they're really good at trotting. Now, we're interested in this story, not just because it's
*28:55.140- 29:01.040* :  any old horses, because Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, is really a fan of these horses,
*29:01.040- 29:06.560* :  and it's presumed that they're imported for him. Because in the past, these horses have been
*29:06.560- 29:12.480* :  used for propaganda purposes in North Korea. And what kind of examples are there of that? Well,
*29:12.480- 29:18.500* :  they used quite a lot. One notable example was five years ago, the North Koreans released video
*29:18.500- 29:24.280* :  and still images of Kim Jong-un and his wife traveling to Mount Pektu. This is the highest mountain
*29:24.280- 29:29.960* :  in North Korea. A real sacred mountain, a sacred place, not just for Korean history, but in Korean
*29:29.960- 29:36.640* :  communist revolutionary histories. Well, Kim Jong-un's father supposedly was born at this mountain.
*29:36.640- 29:44.880* :  This video shows Kim Jong-un riding an all-off trotter horse, a white stallion across this snowy
*29:44.880- 29:51.080* :  mountain. Really, fantastic images really. If you're trying to project an image of strength and
*29:51.080- 29:57.640* :  leadership, then certainly, as a piece of propaganda, this video certainly did that.
*30:10.740- 30:16.940* :  So propaganda to project this image of a vigorous leader, if you like, and yet the backdrop to this
*30:16.940- 30:22.480* :  is poverty and deprivation for a lot of North Koreans. Yeah, like with many things with North
*30:22.480- 30:27.740* :  Korea, some of the things which happen seem strange to people outside the country. They are strange.
*30:27.740- 30:34.020* :  Here we are talking about two dozen thoroughbred horses, but actually the reality of life in North
*30:34.020- 30:39.760* :  Korea, for majority of North Koreans, is very, very poor. It's a very poor country. There's massive
*30:39.760- 30:45.680* :  repression, the kind of repression that probably exists nowhere else on earth. And in order to maintain
*30:45.820- 30:52.960* :  that control that Kim family have over the country, they use propaganda tools like these
*30:52.960- 30:58.840* :  all-off trotter horses in order to project their power, in order to keep empowering, in order to keep
*30:58.840- 31:07.000* :  people repressed. Mickey Brister. The 2024 Paralympics has officially been opened with a spectacular
*31:07.000- 31:12.380* :  ceremony in the heart of Paris. Almost four and a half thousand Paralympians took part in a
*31:12.380- 31:17.780* :  procession around the Place de la Concorde. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss watched the event
*31:17.780- 31:27.460* :  in the French capital. A perfect Parisian evening and a Paralympic curtain razor like no other.
*31:35.360- 31:40.680* :  A Place de la Concorde, an opening ceremony exploring attitudes towards disability,
*31:41.360- 31:46.360* :  French star Christine and the Queen's, with a modern take on an Edith Piaf classic.
*31:50.040- 31:57.220* :  And soon it was time for the athletes, parading down the Champs-Alise, more than 180 countries
*31:57.740- 32:04.080* :  united by a common joy. As the sun finally set over Paris, one of the biggest cheers was for the
*32:04.080- 32:13.240* :  Refugee team, just eight athletes, but what an ovation. The loudest noise, though, was for the hosts,
*32:13.860- 32:19.120* :  the arrival of France sparking jubilation and a very suitable sing-along.
*32:23.860- 32:29.460* :  After that, though, a change of mood, a stunning version of the Marseillais and the raising of the
*32:29.460- 32:38.420* :  French flag. Before the head of the Paralympics delivered an impassioned appeal for inclusivity.
*32:51.060- 32:56.580* :  And with that, the French president Emmanuel Macron declared the games open. Organizers hope
*32:56.580- 33:02.200* :  these games can be the most spectacular ever. They're certainly getting off to a spectacular start.
