*01:19.080- 01:23.080* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.560- 01:28.120* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:28.120- 01:31.120* :  the 27th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:31.120- 01:35.080* :  As Russia again pounds Ukraine with missiles and drones,
*01:35.080- 01:37.640* :  we report on Kiev's fight back.
*01:38.140- 01:42.240* :  The UN says it's been forced to halt its humanitarian operations in Gaza
*01:42.660- 01:45.180* :  after Israel ordered the evacuation of the area
*01:45.440- 01:46.840* :  where aid workers are based.
*01:46.900- 01:49.520* :  The World Health Organization is optimistic
*01:49.560- 01:53.920* :  that MPOX outbreaks in Central Africa can be controlled.
*01:56.800- 01:59.520* :  Also in this podcast, we hear how AI is being used
*01:59.520- 02:01.780* :  to develop treatments for dementia.
*02:02.120- 02:05.920* :  If we can reduce the cost to identify people at higher risk,
*02:06.300- 02:08.820* :  using artificial intelligence like this project,
*02:09.440- 02:11.780* :  we'll hope to speed up the testing of treatments.
*02:17.220- 02:20.100* :  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a war of attrition
*02:20.480- 02:24.540* :  and its latest barrage of 100 or so missiles and as many drones
*02:24.540- 02:27.240* :  again targeted energy infrastructure.
*02:27.940- 02:30.340* :  President Zelensky has called for allied assistance
*02:30.340- 02:32.340* :  in shooting down Russian missiles
*02:32.340- 02:35.080* :  because our international correspondent Paul Adams.
*02:35.500- 02:38.580* :  This is not like the way it was two winters ago
*02:38.580- 02:41.800* :  when essentially the Russians were targeting the energy grid
*02:41.800- 02:46.040* :  but not so much the power generating facilities themselves.
*02:46.760- 02:48.460* :  Once you knock out a power station,
*02:48.860- 02:52.460* :  that takes years to repair if it can be repaired at all.
*02:52.880- 02:55.120* :  And now the country is limping along
*02:55.120- 02:58.540* :  on a handful of its remaining power generation facilities.
*02:59.340- 03:02.320* :  One of those, the hydroelectric plant just north of Kiev,
*03:02.600- 03:04.860* :  was it seems one of the targets today.
*03:05.400- 03:07.940* :  So it does seem as though this is part of a consistent pattern
*03:07.940- 03:10.280* :  which frankly has been going on since the start of the war
*03:10.280- 03:15.480* :  which is to steadily degrade Ukraine of its energy infrastructure
*03:15.940- 03:20.940* :  and force the Ukrainians to live through yet another miserable winter
*03:20.940- 03:23.080* :  in the hope that that breaks the morale of the country.
*03:23.400- 03:25.540* :  And one of the ironies is that when you're in Kiev
*03:26.040- 03:29.720* :  you have access to all of these alert systems and messages
*03:29.720- 03:32.200* :  which tell you that there is a plane taking off
*03:32.240- 03:34.360* :  from somewhere deep inside Russia
*03:34.420- 03:36.400* :  and you know that it's got missiles on board
*03:36.780- 03:40.240* :  designed to target the infrastructure of Ukraine
*03:40.240- 03:45.900* :  but Ukraine is not currently able to deal with those threats at source.
*03:46.500- 03:48.900* :  The other thing, and perhaps this is the area where
*03:49.260- 03:52.100* :  the West might be more amenable to a kind of short-term solution,
*03:52.560- 03:55.500* :  is to make sure that those remaining power generation facilities
*03:55.500- 03:57.760* :  and as I say there's really only a handful of them
*03:58.140- 04:00.840* :  are properly defended with their defence missiles.
*04:00.840- 04:04.000* :  The Ukrainians have had to use huge quantities of them
*04:04.340- 04:07.460* :  both their own existing stocks and Western supplied equipment
*04:07.460- 04:09.400* :  to protect themselves so far.
*04:09.780- 04:11.300* :  There's only so much they can do
*04:11.300- 04:15.580* :  but if they can ensure that those power plants are properly defended
*04:16.060- 04:17.780* :  with patriot missiles and other systems
*04:17.780- 04:20.700* :  then at least they can weather the storm this coming winter
*04:20.700- 04:25.720* :  which everyone is anticipating is going to be possibly the hardest so far.
*04:26.280- 04:29.400* :  Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are still in Russia
*04:29.640- 04:31.200* :  but it's a high-risk gamble
*04:31.680- 04:33.980* :  and it's getting tougher to sustain resistance
*04:33.980- 04:35.740* :  against Russian forces there
*04:36.180- 04:38.460* :  and on the front lines in eastern Ukraine.
*04:39.200- 04:41.620* :  Our Europe correspondent Nick Beek reports from Kiev.
*04:45.180- 04:48.980* :  We used to it and it's awful that we live in this dangerous situation.
*04:48.980- 04:52.940* :  They can kill us but they cannot make us scared.
*04:53.480- 04:55.420* :  Julia is a 19-year-old student.
*04:55.960- 04:59.240* :  What are your feelings today on Ukraine's independence day
*04:59.240- 05:03.480* :  because clearly it's been two and a half years of a brutal war now?
*05:03.660- 05:08.740* :  I was watching the TV and I saw our president Zelensky
*05:08.980- 05:10.120* :  and honestly I was crying.
*05:10.440- 05:12.640* :  Ukrainian forces have actually gone into Russia
*05:13.000- 05:14.240* :  into the Kursk region.
*05:14.600- 05:18.040* :  What do you think of that and has that given people a boost?
*05:18.640- 05:20.100* :  It's like miracle for us.
*05:20.240- 05:21.600* :  We are so happy with it.
*05:23.180- 05:26.000* :  As many as 10,000 elite Ukrainian troops
*05:26.420- 05:28.040* :  are said to have burst across the border
*05:28.500- 05:30.660* :  and seized in a matter of days more land
*05:30.660- 05:33.880* :  than Russia has taken in Ukraine so far this year.
*05:36.100- 05:37.640* :  Three weeks into the incursion
*05:37.640- 05:41.960* :  and we're still in contact with one of the Ukrainian soldiers who went in.
*05:42.320- 05:43.700* :  Let's call him Sergei.
*05:44.020- 05:46.100* :  This is his latest message and he writes,
*05:46.100- 05:49.020* :  at the beginning of the operation we were on the rise.
*05:49.020- 05:50.800* :  We had a minimum of losses.
*05:51.560- 05:53.780* :  Now because of the Russians' fire
*05:54.240- 05:55.600* :  we're losing a lot of guys.
*05:56.040- 05:58.640* :  More over the Russians here are fighting for their land
*05:58.640- 06:00.620* :  just as we are fighting for ours.
*06:00.880- 06:03.720* :  Many of us do not understand the meaning of this operation.
*06:03.720- 06:06.600* :  It's one thing to fight for Harkiv or Zaporija.
*06:07.020- 06:09.520* :  It's another matter for the Kursk region
*06:09.980- 06:11.240* :  which we don't need.
*06:11.720- 06:15.520* :  So it seems that after the initial enthusiasm for Sergei at least
*06:15.780- 06:18.720* :  there is some skepticism about where this goes next.
*06:20.380- 06:23.340* :  The gains of the Kursk incursion need to be tempered
*06:23.500- 06:26.960* :  against continuing losses in the east of Ukraine itself
*06:27.540- 06:30.800* :  where Russia continues to make ground in a nutritional battle.
*06:32.980- 06:34.700* :  As Moscow's troops draw nearer
*06:35.060- 06:37.760* :  many families have been fleeing the city of Pokrovsk
*06:38.140- 06:40.520* :  including Ludmila carrying her possessions.
*06:41.080- 06:45.560* :  Soon it's loud here, constant explosions for the past days.
*06:46.060- 06:50.220* :  When, when, everyone is in panic, people are running away.
*06:50.540- 06:52.220* :  It's difficult all the time.
*06:52.520- 06:55.420* :  We got through to 23-year-old Nazar Voitenkov,
*06:55.660- 06:59.920* :  a volunteer with the 33rd Mechanized Brigade, defending Pokrovsk.
*07:00.180- 07:03.760* :  Have you seen the Russians moving away from where you are?
*07:04.100- 07:05.080* :  Has it become easier?
*07:05.560- 07:09.700* :  No, I don't feel. I think Russians have a resource of troops
*07:09.980- 07:11.760* :  in Kursk region and also in Russia.
*07:12.020- 07:16.480* :  Because Russians use a lot of weapons to cover our towns
*07:16.520- 07:21.120* :  with missiles and bombs, shells and destroy our cities.
*07:24.320- 07:27.060* :  President Zelensky attended a solemn ceremony
*07:27.060- 07:30.720* :  outside the golden domes of St. Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev.
*07:31.060- 07:32.700* :  But for his pre-recorded speech,
*07:33.080- 07:34.800* :  he appeared near the border with Russia,
*07:35.300- 07:37.900* :  hailing the recent seizure of Russian land.
*07:38.440- 07:41.480* :  Russia waged war on us.
*07:41.960- 07:44.360* :  It violated not only sovereign borders,
*07:44.740- 07:48.000* :  but also the limits of cruelty and common sense.
*07:48.560- 07:51.740* :  It was endlessly seeking one thing to destroy us
*07:52.140- 07:54.160* :  and what the enemy brought to our land.
*07:54.580- 07:56.500* :  His now returned to its own home.
*07:57.140- 08:01.220* :  President Zelensky ending that report by Nick Beak in Kiev.
*08:01.600- 08:05.740* :  The UN says it's been forced to halt its humanitarian operations in Gaza
*08:06.140- 08:08.660* :  after Israel ordered the evacuation of the area
*08:08.660- 08:10.200* :  where aid workers are based.
*08:10.640- 08:13.220* :  An unrest spokesman Sam Rose said they were being driven
*08:13.220- 08:15.940* :  into even narrower spaces in Gaza.
*08:16.280- 08:18.920* :  It's a particularly fragile moment.
*08:18.920- 08:21.860* :  We've seen a slew of evacuation orders
*08:22.620- 08:25.700* :  over the first weeks of August.
*08:25.700- 08:27.500* :  So a couple of hundred thousand people
*08:28.160- 08:29.960* :  on the move, yes, again.
*08:30.700- 08:32.420* :  And just like them,
*08:32.420- 08:35.500* :  we are being squeezed into ever smaller areas.
*08:36.080- 08:38.460* :  I'm at least analysts, Sebastian Usher, tell me more
*08:38.460- 08:41.420* :  about why the UN has stopped its operations.
*08:41.460- 08:46.460* :  Well, basically this is because where the UN has now established itself
*08:46.500- 08:49.320* :  in the middle of Gaza in Darabala,
*08:49.320- 08:50.720* :  there's been another evacuation order.
*08:50.720- 08:52.540* :  There have been many of these from the Israeli Army recently.
*08:53.280- 08:55.720* :  And what we're hearing from a UN official
*08:55.720- 08:58.380* :  who is speaking anonymously
*08:58.880- 09:00.940* :  is that they don't know where to go now, essentially.
*09:00.940- 09:04.200* :  There's only around 10%, maybe 11% of Gaza,
*09:04.780- 09:06.540* :  which is still like a humanitarian area.
*09:06.820- 09:08.680* :  They moved up from Raffa down in the south,
*09:08.680- 09:10.720* :  which is where the aid comes in.
*09:11.200- 09:14.260* :  And I mean, they haven't said that they are stopping the operations
*09:14.320- 09:15.760* :  but they're suspending for now,
*09:15.760- 09:18.380* :  hopefully maybe for 24 hours, 48 hours,
*09:18.880- 09:20.300* :  to try and reassess the situation,
*09:20.300- 09:22.100* :  see where they can move it to.
*09:22.120- 09:26.000* :  And this has happened many times before the UN has complained many times
*09:26.000- 09:27.320* :  of the difficulty that it has,
*09:28.200- 09:30.640* :  once it's got the aid in to be able to distribute it,
*09:30.640- 09:32.680* :  particularly as they take it up towards the north.
*09:33.180- 09:35.480* :  And this comes as there's a great deal of concern,
*09:35.480- 09:37.200* :  isn't there, about polio and Gaza?
*09:37.580- 09:40.280* :  Absolutely. I mean, that comes from a couple of weeks ago
*09:40.840- 09:43.740* :  when there were traces of a polio virus detected
*09:43.740- 09:44.860* :  from Earth samples.
*09:45.420- 09:48.320* :  And then after that, the first polio case in 25 years
*09:48.320- 09:50.900* :  in Gaza was confirmed, a 10-month-old baby,
*09:51.440- 09:54.180* :  whose leg is paralyzed from it.
*09:54.740- 09:59.280* :  So what the UN, the three UN aid agencies working there
*09:59.720- 10:03.220* :  are doing is preparing for a vaccination campaign
*10:03.220- 10:06.260* :  for the children of Gaza, around 640,000.
*10:06.260- 10:10.360* :  They brought in around a million vaccinations just this weekend.
*10:10.560- 10:14.020* :  But obviously, this is going to complicate that further.
*10:14.100- 10:16.460* :  They already said that it was going to be very difficult.
*10:16.460- 10:17.900* :  They set up a distribution center.
*10:18.200- 10:19.160* :  How do people come to them?
*10:19.160- 10:22.220* :  They had asked for two, seven-day pauses in the fighting,
*10:22.800- 10:25.340* :  asked Hamas and Israel for that, saying that's the only way
*10:25.340- 10:26.880* :  we can really do this properly.
*10:27.320- 10:28.360* :  That hasn't happened, of course.
*10:29.040- 10:32.160* :  And with the bigger picture, what about prospects for a cease-fire?
*10:32.840- 10:34.560* :  They've dimmed. There's no doubt about that.
*10:34.560- 10:35.540* :  The process hasn't finished.
*10:35.540- 10:37.260* :  The US is still very much talking it off.
*10:37.260- 10:38.700* :  It's really pushing it hard.
*10:39.060- 10:44.240* :  The US sees this as the one way to stop the conflict really widening,
*10:44.660- 10:46.160* :  bringing Iran, bringing in Hasbullah,
*10:46.160- 10:49.920* :  and we saw Hasbullah fire a large number of rockets into Israel on Sunday.
*10:50.200- 10:52.440* :  Now, that wasn't as bad as people had perhaps expected.
*10:52.440- 10:56.040* :  So in a sense, that particular concern has slightly
*10:56.040- 11:00.260* :  subsided about how bad that confrontation between Hasbullah and Israel could become.
*11:00.260- 11:05.260* :  But the Gaza cease-fire talks, they've again kind of founded on major obstacles.
*11:05.260- 11:09.980* :  I mean, the big obstacle at the moment is two strategic zones in Gaza,
*11:09.980- 11:11.220* :  in the south and in the center,
*11:11.640- 11:13.380* :  where Israel wants to maintain some troops.
*11:13.420- 11:19.580* :  And Hamas said, look, what we have agreed to is a complete pull-out of Israeli troops.
*11:19.620- 11:21.520* :  And if that doesn't happen, then there's no deal.
*11:22.060- 11:23.000* :  Sebastian Asher.
*11:24.020- 11:27.240* :  The World Health Organization has laid out a six-point plan
*11:27.240- 11:30.080* :  to curb the spread of impacts of viral disease
*11:30.080- 11:33.700* :  that's already claimed the lives of almost 600 people in Africa.
*11:34.360- 11:37.320* :  WHO says numbers of health care staff should be boosted
*11:37.620- 11:39.100* :  and surveillance should be increased.
*11:39.840- 11:42.000* :  12 African countries have already been affected
*11:42.000- 11:44.940* :  with nearly 19,000 suspected cases,
*11:45.380- 11:47.400* :  most in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*11:47.800- 11:50.220* :  where the majority of those being treated are children.
*11:50.920- 11:54.540* :  Vaccines are on their way to the DRC from the US and from Japan,
*11:54.540- 11:57.820* :  but health professionals warned that much more is needed.
*11:58.520- 12:02.860* :  A correspondent, Mercy Juma, is in another of the continent's most affected countries.
*12:03.380- 12:06.340* :  Burundi. She spoke to Anita, a woman who lives
*12:06.340- 12:09.100* :  in a crowded compound in Bujambura,
*12:09.500- 12:11.940* :  which is experiencing an inbox outbreak.
*12:16.200- 12:20.240* :  A month ago, the first person in this compound started getting blisters.
*12:20.900- 12:23.800* :  We took care of him. We touched him. He held the children.
*12:24.560- 12:25.620* :  We didn't know what it was.
*12:26.480- 12:29.940* :  Then he went to hospital and later five of his kids got it.
*12:30.500- 12:31.920* :  And they play with our children.
*12:31.920- 12:34.420* :  They share clothes and sleep in the same bed.
*12:35.100- 12:37.840* :  Some of us have had mild symptoms and a blister or two.
*12:38.320- 12:40.360* :  We're worried what happens to us now.
*12:41.200- 12:43.800* :  I asked Mercy Juma how people in Bujambura
*12:44.160- 12:46.080* :  are responding to the spread of inbox.
*12:46.680- 12:49.160* :  More than 70 cases have been confirmed here,
*12:49.160- 12:50.740* :  but you're not walking into this town.
*12:51.240- 12:53.640* :  The feeling that I have gotten the last few days,
*12:53.680- 12:57.980* :  the case that there are extremes when it comes to the understanding of inbox.
*12:57.980- 13:01.140* :  I have had a chance to visit one of the treatment facilities here.
*13:01.240- 13:03.280* :  And there's a lot of concern in a lot of care
*13:03.280- 13:04.800* :  that is going to help those who recover.
*13:04.800- 13:08.480* :  I saw about this center that has 61 patients,
*13:08.480- 13:12.320* :  all showing the blisters and the bed reading
*13:12.320- 13:14.920* :  and their confined to their rooms and their spaces.
*13:15.280- 13:17.880* :  On the other side of town, when you go to Bujambura town,
*13:18.320- 13:19.320* :  life is going on as usual.
*13:19.320- 13:21.740* :  People ask how to navigate into public transport.
*13:21.740- 13:24.560* :  There's very little social distancing, so to say.
*13:25.060- 13:28.680* :  And most of those I spoke to do not even know what inbox is.
*13:28.700- 13:31.480* :  And the few that understand it have either seen it on social media
*13:31.480- 13:32.860* :  or had people talk about it.
*13:32.860- 13:34.880* :  So they describe symptoms that they have seen.
*13:35.860- 13:37.780* :  And one of the key doctors here,
*13:37.780- 13:40.520* :  who's the head of the National Emergency Response Plan,
*13:41.060- 13:44.360* :  is not only concerned about how containment is going to be difficult,
*13:44.940- 13:48.700* :  also about the capability of this country to handle testing
*13:48.700- 13:53.200* :  because they only have one testing laboratory issues around water
*13:53.240- 13:55.120* :  because water is a bit limited here
*13:55.120- 13:57.140* :  and people need to wash their hands all the time.
*13:57.660- 13:59.740* :  And she says they really need support
*14:00.380- 14:03.160* :  when it comes to finding and getting vaccines
*14:03.160- 14:04.560* :  and all that's down here.
*14:04.980- 14:07.840* :  And do you think the key to containment is vaccination?
*14:08.180- 14:11.460* :  Vaccination plays an important role, especially for this disease
*14:11.460- 14:14.680* :  that we are being told that the symptoms show at a way
*14:14.680- 14:16.420* :  like this stage you wouldn't know
*14:16.420- 14:20.260* :  or they cannot really test until they get to the lesions
*14:20.260- 14:22.440* :  and they pick the samples and test it.
*14:22.800- 14:25.440* :  Yet somebody could be having it for so many days.
*14:25.920- 14:27.240* :  So vaccination is really important.
*14:27.240- 14:28.840* :  And especially for countries like this
*14:28.840- 14:31.140* :  that borders the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*14:31.140- 14:34.620* :  Congo is just less than 26 miles from Bujumura town.
*14:35.040- 14:38.140* :  And it is the AP center of empokes here in Africa.
*14:38.680- 14:40.320* :  So vaccination is really important.
*14:40.320- 14:43.660* :  And countries like LRC, Bujumura and other countries
*14:43.660- 14:45.240* :  that are seeing an increase in these cases
*14:45.720- 14:48.400* :  should really be considered as the first African countries
*14:48.400- 14:49.620* :  to receive these vaccines.
*14:50.280- 14:52.900* :  Mercy Duma, the captain of a super yacht
*14:52.900- 14:55.620* :  which sank in a storm off Sicily a week ago
*14:55.960- 14:58.540* :  killing the British technology entrepreneur Mike Lynch
*14:58.540- 15:01.880* :  and six other people has been placed under investigation.
*15:02.780- 15:05.420* :  Reports in the Italian media suggest prosecutors
*15:05.420- 15:08.300* :  looking at manslaughter and negligence charges
*15:08.720- 15:11.860* :  against James Cutfield, who's 51 years old
*15:12.160- 15:13.360* :  and who's from New Zealand.
*15:13.960- 15:16.300* :  Our correspondent Bethany Bell has just returned
*15:16.360- 15:19.240* :  from Porticello where the Bayesian sank.
*15:20.000- 15:22.800* :  James Cutfield was first questioned last week.
*15:23.540- 15:25.240* :  At a press conference on Saturday
*15:25.800- 15:29.440* :  the prosecutor Rafael Camarano said he'd been
*15:29.940- 15:30.920* :  extremely cooperative.
*15:32.020- 15:34.980* :  According to the Italian newspaper La Republica
*15:35.460- 15:37.480* :  the authorities interviewed him again
*15:37.480- 15:39.460* :  for more than two hours yesterday.
*15:40.520- 15:43.180* :  The investigation is currently focusing on
*15:43.180- 15:45.660* :  whether manslaughter or negligence
*15:45.660- 15:47.820* :  in causing a shipwreck may have occurred.
*15:48.940- 15:52.260* :  Naval experts are perplexed as to why the super yacht
*15:52.260- 15:55.820* :  sank so quickly while other smaller boats nearby
*15:56.660- 15:57.560* :  survived the storm.
*15:58.500- 16:01.460* :  The vessel which is lying on its side on the seabed
*16:01.800- 16:04.520* :  will be retrieved as part of the investigation.
*16:05.520- 16:07.640* :  Meanwhile reports in the Italian media
*16:08.080- 16:11.160* :  say that post-mortem examinations of the seven victims
*16:11.300- 16:13.080* :  will take place this week.
*16:13.960- 16:14.560* :  Bethany Bell,
*16:15.640- 16:18.580* :  data scientists and clinical researchers in Scotland
*16:18.580- 16:22.940* :  are hoping to use AI to predict a person's risk of dementia.
*16:23.680- 16:26.180* :  The team will use AI and machine learning
*16:26.180- 16:29.620* :  to match the image data with linked health records
*16:29.620- 16:31.960* :  to find patterns that could help doctors
*16:32.380- 16:35.540* :  better determine a person's risk of developing the disease.
*16:36.320- 16:39.100* :  Professor Will Whitely is the co-lead of the project
*16:39.100- 16:43.300* :  at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences.
*16:44.100- 16:46.040* :  We're hoping new treatments for dementia.
*16:46.040- 16:48.840* :  We really need to identify people at risk.
*16:49.140- 16:51.040* :  Currently that's very intensive and the scans
*16:51.040- 16:52.160* :  used are quite costly.
*16:52.760- 16:56.820* :  So if we can reduce the cost to identify people at higher risk
*16:57.180- 16:59.720* :  using artificial intelligence like this project
*17:00.360- 17:02.680* :  we'll hope to speed up the testing of treatments
*17:03.360- 17:06.120* :  over the years to come to really face
*17:06.320- 17:08.680* :  what's going to be a major challenge for us as a country
*17:08.980- 17:12.380* :  the challenge of the number of people developing dementia.
*17:12.820- 17:15.660* :  What we'd like to do is to find those people
*17:15.660- 17:17.300* :  who are at highest risk
*17:17.760- 17:20.800* :  and then invite them to take part in studies in new treatments.
*17:21.420- 17:22.840* :  So there's hope for new treatments.
*17:22.840- 17:26.300* :  There's 127 drugs currently in clinical trials
*17:26.960- 17:29.880* :  but we need to get those trials to work as quickly as possible.
*17:30.420- 17:32.460* :  So if we can identify people at risk
*17:32.460- 17:36.040* :  using scans they have as part of their routine care in the NHS
*17:36.700- 17:39.460* :  we hope that we'll be able to deliver those drugs to patients
*17:40.020- 17:41.800* :  and hopefully some of them will work
*17:41.800- 17:43.280* :  to prevent or treat dementia.
*17:43.660- 17:46.560* :  What we hope to do is to make this a cheap and widely available
*17:46.560- 17:50.940* :  as possible by integrating this artificial intelligence
*17:50.940- 17:54.980* :  into the usual care of brain scans taken in clinical practice.
*17:55.640- 17:59.140* :  The reading and analysing of scans is a really important part
*17:59.140- 18:03.040* :  where artificial intelligence might be able to contribute to care.
*18:04.200- 18:05.840* :  So I think over the coming years
*18:05.840- 18:08.900* :  we'll really see it coming into to routine practice
*18:08.900- 18:10.540* :  in the NHS in many areas.
*18:11.220- 18:15.000* :  Professor Will Pytley, a deep fake pornography scandal
*18:15.000- 18:17.480* :  is causing concern across South Korea.
*18:17.960- 18:22.020* :  The content created by manipulating digital photos and videos
*18:22.560- 18:25.460* :  is believed to be circulating on telegram chat groups
*18:26.060- 18:26.920* :  chasing Lee reports.
*18:27.620- 18:30.340* :  South Korean police say more Koreans are falling victim
*18:30.340- 18:33.720* :  to deep fake sex crimes including women and minors
*18:34.060- 18:36.940* :  as images and videos combining photos of individuals
*18:36.940- 18:40.740* :  with explicit content are circulated in telegram chat groups.
*18:41.480- 18:43.620* :  Officials say 10 teenagers have been arrested
*18:43.620- 18:45.380* :  so far this year for such crimes
*18:45.820- 18:47.080* :  in the capital's whole alone.
*18:47.080- 18:50.520* :  Last year the British Cybersecurity from Security Hero
*18:50.940- 18:54.380* :  analysed nearly 100,000 deep fake pornography videos online
*18:54.500- 18:58.000* :  and found more than half featured South Korean actors and singers.
*19:02.560- 19:03.840* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*19:04.240- 19:05.300* :  I've always been good at sport.
*19:05.300- 19:06.320* :  I've always loved sport.
*19:06.920- 19:09.140* :  Sport has been my savior and when people tell me
*19:09.140- 19:11.720* :  I can't do something in life, I like proving them wrong.
*19:12.120- 19:15.220* :  As the Paralympic Games get underway this week in Paris,
*19:15.640- 19:19.540* :  we hear from an art show preparing to compete for the third time.
*19:26.860- 19:28.560* :  It's that time of the year.
*19:29.120- 19:30.780* :  You're a vacation is coming up.
*19:31.460- 19:33.600* :  You can already hear the beach waves,
*19:34.040- 19:38.320* :  feel the warm breeze, relax and think about
*19:39.440- 19:39.760* :  work.
*19:40.120- 19:42.880* :  You really, really want it all to work out while you're away.
*19:43.300- 19:45.760* :  Monday.com gives you and the team that piece of mind.
*19:46.100- 19:48.720* :  When all work is on one platform and everyone's in sync,
*19:48.720- 19:51.260* :  things just flow wherever you are.
*19:51.660- 19:53.480* :  Tap the banner to go to Monday.com.
*19:56.900- 19:57.640* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*19:57.640- 20:01.820* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed
*20:01.820- 20:03.680* :  to raise prices due to inflation.
*20:04.100- 20:04.720* :  They said yes.
*20:05.140- 20:07.720* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*20:07.720- 20:11.480* :  honorists to your contracts, they said what the **** are you talking about?
*20:11.480- 20:12.900* :  You insane Hollywood ****.
*20:13.380- 20:16.920* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month
*20:16.920- 20:18.740* :  to just $15 a month.
*20:18.780- 20:21.300* :  Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*20:21.440- 20:23.500* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month.
*20:23.500- 20:24.720* :  New customers on first three months plan only.
*20:24.720- 20:25.400* :  Taxes and fees extra.
*20:25.400- 20:26.840* :  Speed slower above 40 gigabyte CDTL.
*20:32.220- 20:35.660* :  Severe flooding in Bangladesh has left 5 million people with
*20:35.660- 20:36.640* :  out electricity.
*20:37.160- 20:41.120* :  Many are also without clean water and food and some remain stranded.
*20:41.680- 20:44.780* :  Can be to pose the director of plan international in Bangladesh
*20:44.780- 20:46.780* :  gave Rob Young this update.
*20:47.380- 20:51.560* :  The situation in Bangladesh, especially around the flood,
*20:52.120- 20:54.720* :  is serious and is devastated.
*20:55.320- 20:57.640* :  The monsoon rains have triggered extensively
*20:58.520- 21:02.900* :  and that has caused flooding, living almost 5 million people stranded,
*21:03.220- 21:08.900* :  including 1.54 million children and artists and around 2 million are women.
*21:08.900- 21:13.660* :  Many families have lost their homes and are in urgent need of safe
*21:13.920- 21:17.320* :  our shelter, clean and safe water, food,
*21:17.320- 21:19.340* :  hygiene supplies and many more.
*21:20.480- 21:24.940* :  The most affected areas are the Southeast part of Bangladesh
*21:25.480- 21:27.740* :  and the Districts called Panyi, Malibu, Bazaar,
*21:28.020- 21:30.000* :  Kumilla, Khajir, and Chidagong.
*21:30.560- 21:36.340* :  And if you look at that, these people are totally traumatized
*21:36.400- 21:40.540* :  and surprised because they have never faced such flood in their lives
*21:40.540- 21:45.500* :  and some of the old people have witnessed that in last 40 years,
*21:45.500- 21:48.760* :  they didn't witness or they didn't experience such kind of flooding.
*21:49.160- 21:52.220* :  What are other aid agencies doing then to try to help people,
*21:52.220- 21:54.380* :  particularly those who are short of clean water and food?
*21:54.600- 21:58.900* :  The needs are serious, government, the chief advisor for the country,
*21:58.900- 22:00.600* :  you know, the interim government chief.
*22:01.340- 22:05.600* :  He has already declared a collective action for this one
*22:05.940- 22:09.460* :  and it is at least for the immediate need, $100 million.
*22:09.780- 22:14.220* :  And then he has appeal to work everybody to respond this one.
*22:14.220- 22:16.960* :  So plan internationally, along with the local NGO,
*22:17.580- 22:21.960* :  international NGO have been trying to support as much as possible for them.
*22:22.280- 22:26.600* :  However, compared to the needs, the capacity on the ground
*22:26.600- 22:28.300* :  and especially for plan internationally,
*22:28.300- 22:33.660* :  Bangladesh are very, very limited in terms of financial resources.
*22:33.660- 22:39.560* :  So it needs a huge, huge collective effort to meet all the needs,
*22:39.560- 22:40.980* :  especially for life saving.
*22:41.420- 22:45.700* :  Kabeeta Bose, North Korea claims to have successfully tested
*22:46.420- 22:48.160* :  exploding drones for the first time.
*22:48.740- 22:51.980* :  Photos published by State Media show the country's leader, Kim Jong Un,
*22:51.980- 22:56.560* :  watching them in action and ordering his military to speed up their development.
*22:57.240- 23:01.360* :  Russia reportedly gave him five drones when he visited the country last year.
*23:01.860- 23:03.980* :  He's a sole correspondent, Jim McKenzie.
*23:04.560- 23:09.540* :  In one of the photographs, a small white drone is shown crashing into what resembles
*23:09.540- 23:12.880* :  a South Korean battle tank and destroying it.
*23:13.380- 23:17.720* :  The images are blurred, making it difficult to see how sophisticated they are.
*23:18.240- 23:20.920* :  But South Korea's military is now trying to work out
*23:21.260- 23:23.900* :  whether these are the drones given by Russia last year,
*23:24.440- 23:28.400* :  or whether North Korea has used that technology to build its own.
*23:28.980- 23:31.260* :  Drones are a priority for Mr. Kim,
*23:31.260- 23:36.360* :  who is seeking to modernize his military and build up an array of weapons
*23:36.420- 23:40.440* :  that threaten not only the U.S., but South Korea too.
*23:40.940- 23:43.900* :  Seoul has spent the past year trying to counter this.
*23:44.420- 23:48.100* :  It's developed a system which it says can detect small drones
*23:48.100- 23:49.480* :  and jam their signals.
*23:50.300- 23:53.160* :  Both Koreas need only glance at Ukraine
*23:53.160- 23:56.500* :  to realize what a massive role these weapons would play
*23:56.500- 23:59.580* :  if a North-South conflict were to break out.
*24:00.160- 24:03.660* :  Jean McKenzie, a few hours after we record this podcast,
*24:03.660- 24:07.040* :  a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX company
*24:07.040- 24:11.880* :  will launch four people into space on a private mission called Polaris Dawn.
*24:12.500- 24:16.160* :  The four astronauts led by the billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman
*24:16.300- 24:19.880* :  will become the first privately trained individuals to take part
*24:19.880- 24:24.000* :  in a spacewalk during which they'll test a new type of space suit.
*24:24.520- 24:27.940* :  One man who knows what it's like up there is former astronaut
*24:27.940- 24:31.440* :  and commander of the International Space Station, Chris Hadfield.
*24:32.080- 24:34.480* :  James Krumasami asked him about the significance
*24:34.480- 24:37.280* :  of the SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission.
*24:37.840- 24:40.600* :  I think the real difference of this spaceflight
*24:41.060- 24:45.420* :  is the fact that it's going to be a privately funded spacewalk.
*24:46.080- 24:48.440* :  And they're doing it extremely professionally
*24:49.320- 24:51.080* :  years of training, years of preparation.
*24:51.240- 24:54.780* :  But it still boils down to the very first time
*24:55.320- 24:58.160* :  that anyone has ever put on this space suit
*24:58.200- 25:00.400* :  and gone out into the empty vacuum of space.
*25:00.860- 25:05.700* :  And they're going to have to open the door on the spaceship.
*25:05.700- 25:06.940* :  There is no airlock.
*25:07.600- 25:10.780* :  So they're going to have to depressurize the entire spaceship
*25:10.960- 25:11.740* :  down to zero.
*25:12.100- 25:14.720* :  So all four astronauts will essentially
*25:15.100- 25:17.700* :  be hooked up to umbilicals and doing spacewalks
*25:17.920- 25:19.260* :  while a couple of them go outside.
*25:19.660- 25:20.460* :  It's a big risk.
*25:20.700- 25:23.020* :  But to have another space suit that works,
*25:23.360- 25:27.020* :  rather than just the Russian one and the American NASA one,
*25:27.320- 25:28.860* :  I think that's a terrific boon.
*25:28.980- 25:30.700* :  Yes, tell us about this new space suit.
*25:30.760- 25:32.500* :  How is it different from previous ones?
*25:32.820- 25:35.200* :  The one that I did my spacewalks in
*25:35.580- 25:38.400* :  was really like the granddaughter of the ones
*25:38.440- 25:39.940* :  that they walked on the moon in.
*25:40.140- 25:42.720* :  The same sort of technology, the same manufacturers.
*25:43.400- 25:44.900* :  It was very much old tech.
*25:45.620- 25:48.000* :  And this is now a clean sheet design
*25:48.000- 25:51.520* :  where SpaceX has said, okay, we're going to do spacewalks.
*25:51.820- 25:52.540* :  Let's start over.
*25:52.540- 25:56.520* :  Let's use the best of new materials, new technologies,
*25:57.460- 26:01.120* :  and try and make this as form fitting, as not bulky,
*26:01.120- 26:03.160* :  as useful as we can think of.
*26:03.760- 26:05.760* :  But it's still like any space suit.
*26:05.760- 26:09.620* :  It's going to be hot and clunky and motion-constraining
*26:09.620- 26:11.360* :  and not a comfortable suit of clothing.
*26:11.940- 26:13.320* :  But one of the cool things it has
*26:13.320- 26:16.340* :  is rather than this ancient sort of display
*26:16.340- 26:18.620* :  that you could barely see strapped your chest
*26:18.620- 26:20.080* :  like it's tiny little computer,
*26:20.660- 26:24.980* :  this has a projected display on the inside of the visor
*26:25.280- 26:26.980* :  that's showing you all the key information,
*26:26.980- 26:29.520* :  pressure and humidity and how well the suit's doing.
*26:30.180- 26:31.860* :  So they made some advances,
*26:32.120- 26:34.840* :  but the real test will come about three or four days
*26:34.840- 26:38.180* :  from now when the crew depressurizes and goes outside.
*26:39.020- 26:41.180* :  Retired astronaut former commander
*26:41.180- 26:44.180* :  of the International Space Station, Chris Hadfield.
*26:44.920- 26:48.720* :  The 2024 Paralympic Games get underway on Wednesday in Paris,
*26:49.240- 26:51.800* :  where South African Sean Anderson will again
*26:51.800- 26:54.400* :  attempt to prove that anything is possible.
*26:54.600- 26:57.840* :  The 51-year-old who's competing in the sport of archery
*26:57.840- 27:02.420* :  first lost his arm in a motorbike accident back in 2004
*27:02.420- 27:06.800* :  and then 13 years later became paralyzed from the waist down
*27:06.800- 27:08.700* :  following a boating accident.
*27:09.560- 27:11.320* :  Despite these life-changing events
*27:11.320- 27:13.880* :  and the impact on his mental health,
*27:14.380- 27:15.900* :  Anderson is now preparing to compete
*27:15.900- 27:18.020* :  in his third Paralympic Games,
*27:18.680- 27:21.980* :  and BBC Sport Africa's Ashland Veden has been to meet him.
*27:26.520- 27:29.760* :  Here on the practice range on his farm in Pretoria,
*27:29.760- 27:33.620* :  Sean Anderson is shooting arrows as he prepares to compete
*27:33.620- 27:36.860* :  in the sport of archery in his third Paralympics.
*27:37.320- 27:41.500* :  Having lost his left arm in a motorcycle accident in 2004,
*27:41.500- 27:45.520* :  Anderson made his debut at the Rio Games in 2016,
*27:45.980- 27:49.120* :  but a year later he was involved in another accident,
*27:49.140- 27:53.100* :  losing the ability to walk after very nearly losing his life.
*27:53.400- 27:54.880* :  I was involved in a boating accident
*27:54.960- 27:57.980* :  where myself and my family were on a chartered boat
*27:57.980- 27:59.200* :  to guard deep sea fishing,
*27:59.740- 28:02.540* :  and we ended up getting hit by a wave with the boat coming down on me.
*28:02.860- 28:04.100* :  I basically started drowning.
*28:04.220- 28:06.840* :  I was under the boat, they say, for about four and a half minutes.
*28:07.300- 28:09.680* :  I don't remember much after that, I remember waking up
*28:10.000- 28:12.000* :  and not having any feeling in my legs.
*28:12.400- 28:16.660* :  Anderson's love affair with Bo and Arrow began before that boating accident.
*28:16.660- 28:20.540* :  In 2011, when already an amputee,
*28:20.640- 28:23.820* :  he took his son to a local range in Johannesburg.
*28:23.980- 28:25.940* :  I said to the owner, I want to shoot as well, and they said,
*28:25.940- 28:28.820* :  I can't. These two words that I'm believing in the word can,
*28:28.820- 28:29.560* :  he's one of them.
*28:34.400- 28:37.520* :  As an arm amputee, without the use of his legs,
*28:37.820- 28:39.700* :  Anderson found a way to compete.
*28:40.280- 28:43.740* :  With the help of an assistant to get kitted up for the sport,
*28:43.960- 28:48.120* :  he uses a trigger system which allows him to shoot the boat with his mouth.
*28:49.000- 28:51.080* :  I've always been good at sport, I've always loved sport.
*28:51.620- 28:54.980* :  Sport has been my savior, and when people tell me I can't do something in life,
*28:55.540- 28:56.480* :  I like proving them wrong.
*28:56.820- 29:00.460* :  Before he's boating accident, Anderson won the world
*29:00.480- 29:01.700* :  even though it's championships.
*29:02.160- 29:08.140* :  By 2016, he had competed at his first Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
*29:08.540- 29:12.580* :  But a year later, his life changed when he lost the use of his legs.
*29:12.860- 29:15.320* :  I've got PTSD, post-traumatic stress.
*29:15.940- 29:18.180* :  I haven't put my head under water since my accident.
*29:18.620- 29:20.260* :  I haven't been on a boat since my accident.
*29:20.300- 29:21.880* :  I don't like water whatsoever, you know.
*29:22.120- 29:25.480* :  Again, he fought back to make a second Paralympics.
*29:25.480- 29:27.700* :  It came in the midst of the pandemic,
*29:27.700- 29:32.280* :  when Anderson lost his father to cover just weeks before the Games.
*29:32.280- 29:38.540* :  After competing in Tokyo, his mental health took another toll and he spiraled into depression.
*29:38.920- 29:43.160* :  I just felt like I wasn't worthy of anything anymore when I wasn't good enough.
*29:44.920- 29:46.460* :  I felt like I was a bird into my family.
*29:47.420- 29:48.420* :  I really took my own life.
*29:49.320- 29:52.640* :  I realized that I loved my life and I loved my family too much.
*29:53.080- 29:56.420* :  I was able to take that day to get close to saying goodbye.
*29:57.080- 30:00.080* :  That I stopped and I realized that I need to ask for help and I got help.
*30:00.780- 30:05.240* :  Now, the 51-year-old is training for his third Paralympics
*30:05.240- 30:07.540* :  on his remote farm in Pretoria.
*30:07.880- 30:11.080* :  Three years ago, Anderson decided to go off-grid.
*30:11.520- 30:15.180* :  I'm on full solar, my boreholes on full solar.
*30:15.380- 30:17.140* :  So I grow my own vegetables.
*30:17.620- 30:18.700* :  I have my own fruit trees.
*30:18.700- 30:21.240* :  We especially sell sustainable on our properties.
*30:21.580- 30:27.420* :  Anderson is also now coaching, looking to introduce youngsters to his chosen sport.
*30:27.760- 30:32.180* :  He believes people don't appreciate the challenges faced by Para athletes.
*30:32.180- 30:35.980* :  Before I can even start training, I have to go through a whole ritual every morning.
*30:36.160- 30:38.840* :  I've got to get up, I've got to do a valve program, I've got to clean my bladder,
*30:38.840- 30:41.400* :  I've got to do this, listen to this, then I finally get down.
*30:41.400- 30:43.600* :  When you see what it takes to just get me set up,
*30:43.840- 30:47.400* :  then I've got to have a guy with me the whole time to collect my arrows and move my arrows back.
*30:48.500- 30:52.520* :  Anderson hasn't decided yet if Paris will be his last games,
*30:52.520- 30:56.540* :  where he'll be competing in the men's individual W1.
*30:57.080- 31:00.840* :  And despite having to draw on all his strength down the years,
*31:01.200- 31:03.600* :  Anderson now seems at peace with life.
*31:05.240- 31:07.540* :  I'm a religious person, I don't think I was cursed.
*31:07.600- 31:09.640* :  I just believe that things happen for a reason.
*31:09.900- 31:13.300* :  I don't always know what all the reasons and what is the big guys playing with me,
*31:13.620- 31:17.720* :  but if people can learn out of what I've achieved and what I've overcome through all my obstacles,
*31:17.720- 31:19.280* :  then I've done the right thing.
*31:21.620- 31:25.420* :  South Africa and the Paralympian is Sean Anderson ending that report by BBC
*31:25.420- 31:27.120* :  Support Africa's Ashland Veden.
*31:27.800- 31:31.580* :  And if you are suffering distress or despair and need support,
*31:31.580- 31:36.200* :  you can speak to a health professional or an organisation that offers support.
*31:36.900- 31:40.260* :  Details of help available in many countries can be found at
*31:40.260- 31:42.000* :  Brefrenda's Worldwide.
*31:42.000- 31:46.420* :  That's at www.befrenda's.org.
*31:46.860- 31:51.300* :  And if you're in the UK, help is available via the BBC Action Line.
*31:53.700- 31:57.700* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*32:18.640- 32:20.680* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and until next time, bye bye.
*32:29.120- 32:30.580* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right?
*32:31.480- 32:37.380* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time when he was the biggest star
*32:37.380- 32:44.200* :  in all the world, but something happened, not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
*32:44.860- 32:47.680* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.
*32:48.720- 32:54.200* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
