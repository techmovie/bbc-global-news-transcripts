*01:21.240- 01:27.240* :  BBC World Service. Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Sunday
*01:27.240- 01:32.800* :  the 11th of August. An Israeli airstrike hits a school in Gaza killing dozens of Palestinians.
*01:32.800- 01:38.400* :  Israel says it was targeting Hamas, but the US has far too many civilians are being killed.
*01:39.020- 01:45.040* :  Russia evacuates 76,000 people following the cross-border attack by Ukraine. And officials in
*01:45.040- 01:50.280* :  Japan are urging people not to hoard supplies after warning of a possible mega earthquake.
*01:52.560- 01:56.840* :  Also in the podcast, myself and my boyfriend have been on a Banksy Coral, so we've gone to
*01:56.980- 02:00.960* :  the pelicans in the morning and then we've just been at the monkeys and brick lane and then we saw
*02:00.960- 02:06.580* :  that Banksy had posted the cats they were here now. Why the elusive graffiti artist has been so busy
*02:06.580- 02:17.300* :  in London this week. But we begin in Gaza and an Israeli airstrike on a school which reportedly
*02:17.300- 02:23.440* :  killed more than 80 people has drawn strong international condemnation. The US had far too many
*02:23.440- 02:28.160* :  civilians continued to be killed in the Palestinian territory and it was asking Israel for more
*02:28.160- 02:33.820* :  details about the attack. The UK said it was appalled, while Turkey called it a new crime against
*02:33.820- 02:40.600* :  humanity. Two of the nations mediating in the Gaza war, Qatar and Egypt also hit out the Israeli
*02:40.600- 02:47.280* :  action. Israel said the strike had, quote, eliminated at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists
*02:47.280- 02:53.240* :  and it disputed the overall number of people killed. Video from the scene showed body parts scattered
*02:53.240- 02:57.760* :  on the ground. Farah Zafana is director of ambulance services in the Gaza Strip.
*03:01.080- 03:07.000* :  This is a massacre and a genocide against civilians in this displacement center in the Gaza
*03:07.000- 03:13.140* :  Strip. It was targeted by war playing and when we came here we were surprised by the size of this
*03:13.140- 03:19.600* :  massacre and genocide. We saw piles of bodies, piled one on the other, human remains shredded
*03:19.600- 03:27.180* :  into pieces. The airstrike came less than two days after Israel agreed to take part in new cease
*03:27.180- 03:32.660* :  fire and hostage negotiations. Independent Palestinian official Mustafa Barguiti said the attack
*03:32.660- 03:38.160* :  was a deliberate attempt to damage those talks. But what do the families of the remaining Israeli
*03:38.160- 03:44.460* :  hostages make of it? The BBC spoke to Sharon Livshits whose parents were abducted on 7 October.
*03:45.160- 03:50.640* :  Her mother, Yachtived, was released, but her 83-year-old father, Oded, remains in Gaza,
*03:50.640- 03:57.500* :  his fate unknown. It seems to me that the egos of the people leading Israel and Palestinians are
*03:57.500- 04:04.140* :  very much about their own survival, their own political interest. It's desperate. We've been
*04:04.140- 04:11.740* :  fighting so hard for the return of our loved ones. Their dying as time goes on and some of the
*04:11.740- 04:17.880* :  families here that their loved ones are dead. My father is still presumed alive and it's very
*04:17.880- 04:26.500* :  hard to explain what it is like to know that your father is there and that for 10 months I was not
*04:26.500- 04:35.720* :  able to hug him or care for him or make sure that he's okay. I got more details about the Israeli
*04:35.720- 04:42.240* :  airstrike from our correspondent Jenny Hill in Tel Aviv. We know that around 1,000 people,
*04:42.240- 04:48.400* :  most of them having been displaced several times over had taken shelter in the school. And it was
*04:48.400- 04:54.820* :  just before dawn when many of those people were engaged in warning prayer that Israel struck.
*04:54.820- 05:01.520* :  The defence forces have told us that they targeted the school with three separate missiles.
*05:01.520- 05:07.940* :  You have seen some of the footage I'm sure coming out of Gaza as well as heard scenes of
*05:07.940- 05:13.380* :  absolute carnage. It said that a fire broke out as soon as the missiles struck. Tonight,
*05:13.380- 05:19.320* :  Gaza's in mourning and trying to find shelter somewhere else ahead of yet another fearful night.
*05:19.880- 05:25.580* :  The Israeli defence force say that they specifically targeted the school because they believed that
*05:25.580- 05:33.380* :  it was a Hamas base. Specifically, they said they suspected 20 Hamas and Islamic jihad fighters were
*05:33.380- 05:41.140* :  operating out of the compound. We have seen Israel in recent weeks repeatedly strike schools. They
*05:41.140- 05:48.160* :  are mainly being used as shelters by displaced people. Israel though every time it hits a school
*05:48.160- 05:54.480* :  insists it's doing so because in review it's a legitimate target. It's housing a Hamas command
*05:54.480- 06:01.260* :  centre or base and every time Israel insists it does everything it can to minimise the loss of
*06:01.260- 06:07.240* :  life. But we've seen a huge amount of international reaction. Qatar has demanded an urgent investigation,
*06:07.240- 06:12.560* :  not just into today's strike, but into this recent repetition of strikes on schools.
*06:12.960- 06:20.400* :  Qatar, of course, one of the main mediators in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Israel
*06:20.400- 06:27.620* :  agreed a couple of days ago to send delegates to attend new talks. Will that be off now following
*06:27.620- 06:33.120* :  this strike? Well, this is now the question, Hamas, for starters, have issued a furious reaction.
*06:33.240- 06:38.120* :  They've accused Israel of fabricating lies in order to deliberately target civilians. They
*06:38.120- 06:43.260* :  describe this as a horrific crime. Now, you're right. The strike comes just a few days after the
*06:43.260- 06:49.540* :  leaders of the US, Qatar and Egypt, in a highly unusual step, issued a joint statement urging
*06:49.580- 06:55.540* :  Israel and Hamas to agree to that ceasefire and hostage return deal talks were
*06:55.540- 07:00.160* :  penciled in for this coming Thursday. Israel had said it would send a delegation. Hamas
*07:00.500- 07:07.780* :  had not officially reacted to that. Earlier, Egypt condemned the strike and said it revealed what
*07:07.780- 07:14.220* :  it described as Israel's lack of political will to achieve that peace. Jenny Hill in Tel Aviv.
*07:14.920- 07:19.620* :  For five days now, Russia has been struggling to counter a surprise cross-border attack by
*07:19.620- 07:25.040* :  Ukraine. The Russians have sent extra tanks and artillery to the Kursk region while evacuating
*07:25.040- 07:31.260* :  76,000 people from areas near the border. After advancing up to 10 kilometers into Kursk,
*07:31.540- 07:36.460* :  Ukrainian troops have now posted video showing them inside the neighboring Russian region of Belgorod.
*07:36.940- 07:40.660* :  While President Zelensky has acknowledged the Ukrainian incursion for the first time.
*07:45.380- 07:51.280* :  Today, I received several reports from Commander-in-Chief Sergei regarding the front lines and our actions to
*07:51.280- 07:56.240* :  push the war onto the aggressor's territory. I am grateful to every unit of defense forces
*07:56.240- 08:01.880* :  ensuring that Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary
*08:01.880- 08:06.620* :  pressure on the aggressor. More details on how Russia is responding from our Ukraine
*08:06.620- 08:11.520* :  correspondent James Waterhouse. An evacuation of this size either reflects the threat
*08:11.520- 08:16.740* :  officials think people are facing or the response Moscow is planning. It appears to be part of a
*08:16.740- 08:22.160* :  so-called anti-terrorist operation, which includes restricting the movement of people and vehicles
*08:22.160- 08:27.000* :  as well as allowing phone taps. As of now, Russia is struggling to contain an offensive,
*08:27.000- 08:32.380* :  which it says involves a thousand troops. The Ukrainians have reportedly seized several villages
*08:32.900- 08:37.780* :  and are also threatening the town of Suja. The leader of neighboring Belarus and Kremlin
*08:37.780- 08:42.340* :  ally Alexander Lukashenko has announced he's moving more troops to the border after drones
*08:42.340- 08:52.120* :  were reported over his country. The air defense forces destroyed several targets over the territory
*08:52.120- 08:57.760* :  of Belarus. We suspect these were attack drones that violated the airspace of Belarus,
*08:58.460- 09:04.860* :  flying from Ukraine over the territory of Belarus. We destroyed the targets. The rest were
*09:04.860- 09:09.100* :  handed over to the Russian Federation. This is a Ukrainian operation which appears to have the
*09:09.100- 09:14.520* :  support of the West. Today the U.S. assigned off its 63rd military support package for Ukraine,
*09:14.540- 09:21.300* :  $125 million worth of mostly ammunition and missile launches. James Waterhouse in Kiev.
*09:22.300- 09:27.200* :  Officials in Japan are urging people not to hoard supplies after warning of a possible
*09:27.200- 09:33.200* :  mega-earth quake. The alert was issued after a 7.1 magnitude quake struck on Thursday.
*09:33.200- 09:35.780* :  These residents in Tokyo say they feel prepared.
*09:40.200- 09:44.500* :  I am quite worried, but on the other hand, I have known all along that mega quake will happen
*09:44.500- 09:51.160* :  at some point, so I would say I am relatively well prepared. A emergency food, a portable toilet,
*09:51.640- 09:55.180* :  helmet, blankets. These are the kind of things I have already gathered.
*09:58.120- 10:03.740* :  I'm a hiker myself, so I've got maybe two weeks worth of food and gas. Although I'm a bit short
*10:03.740- 10:09.740* :  on water, I have a tent as well, so I'm optimistic we can manage as long as we have a safe place to
*10:09.740- 10:15.580* :  evacuate to. Real Leonardo has more details. Japan's first ever mega-earth quake warning
*10:15.580- 10:20.300* :  appears to have spurred many people to action in recent days, but water wall media coverage
*10:20.300- 10:25.540* :  and government reminders to restock essentials may have in fact been too successful. Pictures of
*10:25.540- 10:30.480* :  empty shelves are becoming more common. In Tokyo, which is outside the earthquake warning area,
*10:30.480- 10:35.900* :  supermarkets say sale restrictions are imminent. One blamed quake-related media reports.
*10:36.560- 10:41.240* :  Shortages have also been seen in heavily populated areas of southern and western Japan facing
*10:41.240- 10:46.360* :  the Nankai trough, where scientists say a mega quake is more likely than usual. Government
*10:46.360- 10:51.500* :  ministries are now urging people to buy only what they need. Nankai trough earthquakes happen
*10:51.500- 10:56.740* :  between every 90 and 200 years and are usually accompanied by hugely destructive tsunamis,
*10:57.360- 11:00.680* :  but experts say that while the risk is elevated, it's still low.
*11:01.120- 11:06.780* :  Well Leonardo, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh's Supreme Court has stepped down under pressure
*11:06.780- 11:11.420* :  from the protesters who helped overthrow his former boss, Prime Minister Sheikh Haseena.
*11:12.020- 11:16.960* :  Abidil Hassan oversaw the war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of her opponents.
*11:17.760- 11:21.140* :  A South Asia correspondent Samir Haseena has this report from DACA.
*11:27.880- 11:32.400* :  Thousands marched on the grounds of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, ignoring requests
*11:32.400- 11:38.900* :  by the military to vacate the premises. Protesters were demanding the Chief Justice of the Supreme
*11:38.900- 11:44.080* :  Court resign. Police, holding up our brothers and sisters, has died,
*11:44.500- 11:50.380* :  fighting up one person agency. That's why we demand the resignation, obviously justice.
*11:51.020- 11:56.800* :  Several hours later, the demands of the student demonstrators were met. Under pressure for being seen
*11:56.800- 12:01.720* :  as sympathetic to the previous government, the country's Chief Justice quit.
*12:02.560- 12:07.820* :  While these protests were peaceful, there is growing concern about the lack of law and order
*12:08.060- 12:14.100* :  in Bangladesh. Despite being summoned back to work, the country's police force largely
*12:14.100- 12:20.300* :  remains absent on the streets of DACA, after fleeing their posts, fearing reprisal for their
*12:20.300- 12:25.500* :  use of deadly force against protesters. Samir Haseena in the Bangladesh capital.
*12:26.100- 12:31.320* :  Over the past week, a number of streets in London have been adorned by some striking new additions,
*12:31.320- 12:36.320* :  a series of images spray painted on buildings by the secretive British graffiti artist Banksy.
*12:36.480- 12:40.060* :  They include elephants, pelicans, a goat, and a trio of monkeys.
*12:40.060- 12:46.400* :  The latest, which appeared on Saturday, is of a big cat on an advertising hoarding in North London.
*12:46.860- 12:50.000* :  Paul Goff, Professor of Fine Arts at the University of the West of England,
*12:50.640- 12:53.380* :  explains why Banksy's work attracts so much interest.
*12:53.980- 13:00.840* :  It's iconographic. It tells a story very, very quickly, but is also attuned to the zeitgeist,
*13:00.840- 13:04.700* :  either because of what's happening in the world or the timing that it's put there.
*13:05.080- 13:09.760* :  And it's that level of specificity that I think Mark Banksy is a very particular sort of artist.
*13:09.760- 13:15.460* :  I think what he's done in terms of anti-marketing, the idea that the message must speak
*13:15.460- 13:19.020* :  more loudly than the image of the artist is a very powerful one.
*13:19.460- 13:23.100* :  And I think, you know, he would argue that he's a villain, that he's illegal,
*13:23.100- 13:29.100* :  he has graffitied buildings, he has cred on the streets, and he now has cred in his bank as well.
*13:29.400- 13:33.500* :  But I think the anonymacy, you know, it might be wearing thin, but it kind of gives him a
*13:33.500- 13:37.280* :  veneer of authority, which I think carries him right across the world.
*13:37.280- 13:42.880* :  Professor Paul Goff, but just what is Banksy trying to say with his animal art?
*13:42.880- 13:47.480* :  A question I put to the BBC's Bovane Varde, as she stood beside the newest image.
*13:48.160- 13:52.780* :  Well, the deep and hidden meaning maybe, as elusive as the artist himself,
*13:53.480- 13:57.240* :  people I've been speaking to, they think that maybe these mules are meant to be temporary,
*13:57.240- 14:01.340* :  maybe they're meant to give the areas around here a bit of a lift,
*14:01.340- 14:06.280* :  or perhaps a boost at a time where community tensions have been on the rise.
*14:06.600- 14:11.840* :  As he said, they are all animal themed, and the one hearing Cricklewood in Northwest London
*14:12.160- 14:16.480* :  is a large cat stretching out on a disused billboard.
*14:16.480- 14:20.480* :  And like in many other neighborhoods where these artworks have popped up,
*14:20.640- 14:25.460* :  they've created quite a bit of buzz. We've had lots of people all afternoon coming down to take
*14:25.460- 14:30.520* :  selfies. There have been crews from all around the world coming to take an interest and cover
*14:30.520- 14:35.540* :  the story as well. I was in Walthamstow yesterday when the two birds appear to be a fishing appeared
*14:35.540- 14:40.280* :  on top of a chip shop, and we had crews there from Japan, Italy and France.
*14:40.280- 14:44.700* :  And so a great buzz and a positive feeling, most of the people who come to visit
*14:45.000- 14:46.980* :  have been feeling great. This is what some of them have to say.
*14:47.340- 14:50.480* :  We just think they're just a nice thing to cheer on, basically.
*14:50.920- 14:52.300* :  Yeah, we just like the fact they're animals.
*14:52.500- 14:53.120* :  Yeah, we do.
*14:53.500- 14:55.700* :  Myself, my boyfriend, have been on a Banksy crawl today.
*14:55.700- 14:59.780* :  So we've gone to the pelicans in the morning, and then we've just been at the monkeys in
*14:59.780- 15:03.440* :  Brick Lane, and then we saw that Banksy had posted the cats they were here now,
*15:04.120- 15:05.040* :  and we'll go to Elephant's after.
*15:05.380- 15:10.020* :  But I'm just very glad it's animals, because I'm very intonate, so it's great that it's all animals.
*15:10.020- 15:13.300* :  Bring a bit of positivity around London in these times as well.
*15:13.500- 15:17.440* :  And it's bringing people together. We just met here, we've just been chatting for about 20 minutes.
*15:17.440- 15:20.320* :  Yeah. Banksy or London is great.
*15:21.060- 15:26.180* :  And Bavani, are they securing that artwork where you are after a one has already been stolen?
*15:27.280- 15:33.320* :  That's right. The one in Peckham of a wolf whistling that was revealed on a satellite dish.
*15:33.640- 15:37.380* :  The appear to have been stolen within a couple of hours of it being revealed.
*15:37.380- 15:43.560* :  And here in Cricklewood this afternoon, we had a man who said he was a contractor for the owner
*15:43.560- 15:47.040* :  of the billboard, coming to take it down. So the police have been here,
*15:47.380- 15:50.680* :  cordoned it off, and they seem to be in the process of removing it.
*15:50.680- 15:54.500* :  And another one appears to have been defaced. The elephants have appeared to have been defaced.
*15:54.760- 16:00.060* :  Bavani Varde, and since she visited the site, the billboard with the big cat has been taken away.
*16:01.280- 16:03.200* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast.
*16:03.200- 16:07.640* :  The idea was to have a bell, which was a kind of proximity with the athletes.
*16:07.640- 16:13.040* :  And when they ring the bell, you don't need to explain them how to do it.
*16:13.380- 16:16.120* :  What is with that bell that the Olympic winners keep ringing?
*16:23.900- 16:27.780* :  It's that time of the year. Your vacation is coming up.
*16:28.420- 16:36.640* :  You can already hear the beach waves, feel the warm breeze, relax, and think about work.
*16:36.640- 16:41.460* :  You really, really want it all to work out while you're away. Monday.com gives you

*17:36.020- 17:41.180* :  A huge rubbish dump has collapsed near the Ugandan capital camp parlour engulfing homes and
*17:41.180- 17:46.360* :  killing at least eight people, two of them children. The authorities say it was caused by structural
*17:46.360- 17:52.320* :  failure, probably triggered by heavy rain. This eyewitness, ayango or fumbi, describe what he saw.
*17:52.700- 17:58.000* :  We hear something like bledge after we start seeing people that are running, then soil is
*17:58.000- 18:03.460* :  sloping down with the people of cause. We have seen people died now, they are men, but they are still
*18:03.460- 18:09.600* :  looking for other bodies. We got an update from Richard Kugoy. Rescue operations continue at the
*18:09.600- 18:14.520* :  Chittesie landfill where emergency personnel are using excavators to search for survivors,
*18:14.960- 18:19.080* :  large crowds of local residents have gathered at the scene, some holding pictures of missing
*18:19.080- 18:24.880* :  relatives who live nearby. Authorities warn that more bodies could still be buried under the debris.
*18:25.480- 18:28.960* :  The compiler city authority sees the colossal scores by structural failure,
*18:29.400- 18:34.440* :  likely triggered by heavy rains in the area. The 36 Ica-Lunfield has been the city's primary
*18:34.440- 18:41.220* :  garbage dump for decades. Richard Kugoy reporting. Thousands of anti-racism
*18:41.220- 18:47.080* :  demonstrators gathered in cities across the UK on Saturday in response to a recent upsurge in far
*18:47.080- 18:51.620* :  right unrest. The violence, some of the worst for more than a decade, was sparked by the killing
*18:51.620- 18:56.680* :  of three young girls at a holiday club in the northwestern town of Southport. Online rumours
*18:56.680- 19:01.320* :  falsely claimed the killer was a Muslim asylum seeker. Angry mobs took to the streets,
*19:01.320- 19:06.800* :  vandalising shops and businesses, targeting mosques and clashing with police. Our political
*19:06.800- 19:10.780* :  correspondent Rob Watson has been speaking to locals in one of the areas affected,
*19:10.780- 19:16.820* :  Bolton, in Greater Manchester. My first stop, a predominantly Muslim part of town.
*19:17.960- 19:23.120* :  Do you feel a bit less safe since the riot? Yeah, it definitely makes me think twice
*19:23.120- 19:26.060* :  before going outside. But do you think the people who have been rioting
*19:26.060- 19:30.000* :  do you think they're a minority or do you think they represent British society?
*19:32.020- 19:36.280* :  I don't think they represent British society. I think they're sort of angry and they need
*19:36.280- 19:43.300* :  them where to. I will let the anger and they've sort of chosen immigration. My parents have been
*19:43.820- 19:49.380* :  brought up here, born and bred here as well. And see them forging me and saying to me saying,
*19:49.380- 19:56.160* :  don't go to work, make sure your wife's alright. It's kind of bit disturbing, isn't it really?
*19:56.320- 20:00.160* :  There is certain things that needs to be done like integration, but some people are put off
*20:00.160- 20:04.100* :  with it saying, look, they're different from us. They don't do what we do, like part of it,
*20:04.100- 20:12.680* :  go out to drink. This is why people saying Muslims are different. We've got so many things
*20:12.680- 20:19.160* :  in common that they don't realize their spots, food, you know, things like that. It's all about
*20:19.160- 20:24.700* :  talking to each other and not going out and just going to stride things. But what about white
*20:24.700- 20:29.860* :  residents? What do they think is behind what's been happening? What would them? That's what it is.
*20:30.460- 20:34.060* :  So you don't buy the argument that it's about immigration or anything like that? I don't
*20:34.060- 20:39.600* :  think it's a bit of everything. I'm not racist. I just think it's just over the top.
*20:40.060- 20:44.220* :  There's too much immigration, but do you support the rights that we've seen?
*20:44.580- 20:49.560* :  I don't support them, they're pathetic as well, because they're just burning their own terms and
*20:49.560- 20:56.660* :  sex. I just can't understand why everybody can't just get on with each other, you know, and live
*20:57.040- 21:01.760* :  together because it doesn't matter what color you wear or whatever. We're all still human beings.
*21:02.820- 21:06.340* :  So you've said that that people should all get along whatever color they are, but you're
*21:06.340- 21:08.980* :  still thinking that immigration is too high. You think that's a different thing?
*21:09.000- 21:14.980* :  Yeah, yeah. That's on the visa, I mean, they're not looking after us, they're looking after
*21:14.980- 21:21.080* :  everybody out, but we don't need all this trouble, do they? My last stop is a quick chat with the
*21:21.080- 21:28.400* :  deputy leader of Bolton Town Council Acta Zaman and previously at first Asian Mayor. How would you
*21:28.400- 21:34.060* :  describe the mood and the Muslim community here in Bolton and what's your message to that community?
*21:35.220- 21:40.740* :  Well, right now there's a lot of fear within the Muslim community and quite understandably so,
*21:41.880- 21:48.480* :  but I would say to the Muslim community that we live in a society where a majority of our
*21:48.480- 21:56.440* :  communities are peace-loving, law-abiding people, so go about your everyday business as normal,
*21:57.120- 22:00.280* :  be vigilant. But don't panic. But don't panic.
*22:01.280- 22:05.880* :  For now, the focus of the government is on bringing the violence to an end through tough police
*22:05.880- 22:11.820* :  action. There is a broad consensus that bad as the violence has been, it's only involved a
*22:11.820- 22:16.360* :  relatively small number of people and that Britain is not on the brink of civil war.
*22:17.140- 22:21.880* :  But in the longer term, it has been argued Britain does need a national conversation on such
*22:21.880- 22:28.420* :  sensitive issues as social cohesion and immigration. All that said, given the past reluctance of
*22:28.420- 22:34.580* :  politicians to talk about these difficult subjects, there is of course no guarantee that this time
*22:34.580- 22:40.520* :  will be any different. A political correspondent Rob Watson. Now, if you've seen any of the
*22:40.520- 22:44.220* :  meddle events in the athletics at the Paris Olympics, you may have noticed the winners
*22:44.900- 22:47.620* :  celebrating by ringing a large bell on the side of the track.
*22:50.960- 22:55.000* :  Well, after the games finished, the bell will be installed at the restored not-trade
*22:55.900- 23:00.540* :  cathedral and will ring again when the building reopens in December, almost six years after it
*23:00.540- 23:06.440* :  was nearly destroyed by fire. Sean Farrington spoke to Paul Bergamo of the Cornville-Harvard
*23:06.440- 23:11.660* :  Bell Foundry in Normandy, which made the victory bell and who Leslie Duffer, head of sports
*23:11.660- 23:17.860* :  presentation for Paris 24, who came up with the idea. Well, actually, it was a very simple idea of
*23:18.160- 23:23.640* :  we were looking for having a bell at the beginning for athletics because in athletics and in
*23:23.640- 23:28.980* :  mini sports, there is a very often a bell that is being run for the last lap or for many other
*23:28.980- 23:35.840* :  opportunities. So at the very beginning, the question was only to have a bell. So you decided to
*23:35.840- 23:41.960* :  have a bell. Did you quite realize how big a feature it would become of the days events on the
*23:41.960- 23:48.220* :  track and field? Absolutely not. The first wonder that we had with the team was like, where do we
*23:48.220- 23:53.300* :  get a bell? Because this is not something that you purchase every day. So we first been
*23:53.300- 24:00.060* :  wondering where we would get it, how it is made, because it was also a wonder. It was the first
*24:00.060- 24:05.460* :  of my life that I was wondering about making a bell and then we started to research and this is
*24:05.460- 24:13.040* :  how we found the foundry, Cornieva. Well, Paul, were you expecting this to be falling to you to
*24:13.460- 24:20.200* :  make such an important bell? Of course not. It was an amazing surprise, but a good surprise.
*24:21.020- 24:27.040* :  We built a way to make this bell suitable to the stadium and to the Olympic Games. That was the
*24:27.040- 24:33.060* :  first step. What should be this bell, how it should ring, how it should appear, how the athletes
*24:33.060- 24:39.640* :  could fill it and ring it? The idea, I think, was to have a bell, which was a kind of proximity
*24:39.640- 24:46.840* :  with the athletes. And what we feel is that when they ring the bell, you don't need to explain
*24:46.840- 24:51.480* :  them how to do it. It's very instinctive. Have you been watching them thinking, Hank, don't
*24:51.480- 24:54.820* :  ring it too hard. It's not supposed to, some of them, you know, they just want a gold medal,
*24:54.820- 25:00.960* :  biggest moment of their lives. Of course, but I mean, no judgment. I mean, they need to fill it
*25:00.960- 25:06.820* :  and to ring it as they wish. It is the moment, as you said, of their life and they should do whatever
*25:06.820- 25:13.160* :  they want. And a huge moment for Notre Dame, Paul, after everything that has been taking place
*25:13.160- 25:20.880* :  since the fire. We personally have a very strong link with Notre Dame, as we met the bell in 2012,
*25:21.580- 25:26.820* :  and we received them after the fire for an analysis and restoration. We still have them
*25:27.200- 25:35.560* :  in our fondry at the moment. And to have the idea of this Olympic Games bell going back to Notre Dame
*25:35.560- 25:42.120* :  is a way to give a second life to this bell. So I'm very glad about it. Leslie, the end is almost
*25:42.120- 25:48.440* :  here. What's been the biggest memory for you the last few weeks? Oh, hearing all these people,
*25:48.440- 25:54.900* :  these thousands of people singing along French songs is really something that gives me goosebumps,
*25:54.900- 26:02.960* :  really, for real. And Paul, for you? I think it's a very deep value of the Olympic Games community
*26:02.960- 26:09.360* :  of everybody for the same target. So it's very pleasant. Paul Bergamo and Leslie defer talking to Sean
*26:09.360- 26:15.300* :  Farrington. And that is all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast
