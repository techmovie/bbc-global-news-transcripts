*01:31.680- 01:35.200* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:37.240- 01:42.920* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh and in the early hours of Friday the 16th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:43.760- 01:47.920* :  The World Health Organization says more cases of a dangerous variant of
*01:47.920- 01:53.620* :  epochs are likely to be found in Europe in the coming days after Sweden reports the first
*01:53.620- 01:59.720* :  infection outside Africa. As international pressure builds for a ceasefire between Israel and
*01:59.720- 02:06.320* :  Hamas a new round of talks begins in Qatar. The authorities in the United States charge five
*02:06.320- 02:10.260* :  people over the death last year of the friend star Matthew Perry.
*02:13.260- 02:19.100* :  Also in this podcast it's nothing less than just vindictive cruelty. We're talking about 50 bucks
*02:19.100- 02:25.120* :  to try to alleviate the suffering of people of Ukraine. Washington condemns a jail term
*02:25.120- 02:30.820* :  handed to a ballerina for donating to a US funded charity supporting Ukraine.
*02:35.960- 02:40.700* :  Just a day after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency
*02:40.700- 02:47.120* :  over the spread of a more deadly variant of epochs the first case of the disease has been found
*02:47.120- 02:53.660* :  outside Africa. Sweden says a man who is infected while in an African country has fallen ill
*02:53.660- 03:00.340* :  with the new variant. Dr. Burat Pancania teaches at the University of Exeter Medical School.
*03:00.860- 03:05.820* :  He says there's no doubt the new version of epochs is more of a public health threat.
*03:06.620- 03:16.300* :  This particular variant of epochs as we now call it played 1b is appearing to be much more
*03:16.300- 03:23.740* :  infectious and by being much more infectious unfortunately it generates more cases and then
*03:23.740- 03:30.220* :  generating more cases also results in more people unwell and then some of them will die.
*03:30.900- 03:37.960* :  Magnus Gislin is Sweden's chief epidemiologist. He told the BBC that so far the outbreak there
*03:37.960- 03:44.240* :  seems to be limited to that one patient. We don't have any indications of spread from this
*03:44.240- 03:49.200* :  person but of course that's something that we are looking at very closely together with sort
*03:49.200- 03:55.380* :  of authorities, local authorities. So it's very important to avoid a spread within the country.
*03:56.240- 04:01.760* :  My colleague Nigel Adely asked our health correspondent Dominic Hughes how the international
*04:01.760- 04:07.900* :  community has been reacting. As you would expect a lot of public health officials around the world
*04:07.980- 04:14.940* :  paying a lot of attention to that. We've heard here in the UK for example that the UK Health
*04:14.940- 04:21.480* :  Security Agency are monitoring and surveilling as you would expect. They have told us that they are
*04:22.280- 04:27.040* :  ready should the need arise but there are no cases here yet but obviously then we've had this
*04:27.040- 04:33.580* :  case that's been reported in Sweden which is the first case outside of Africa related to what's
*04:33.580- 04:40.300* :  known as this clade 1b. Basically that's a variant of inbox. And this is essentially a variant
*04:40.300- 04:46.300* :  of the disease that is driving this surge in infections across 16 countries in Africa.
*04:47.040- 04:53.600* :  It's more dangerous and more infectious than the variant that led to the outbreak in 2022
*04:53.600- 04:59.180* :  and that outbreak affected more than 100 countries. So there's a lot of concern out there I think.
*05:00.320- 05:05.160* :  And you mentioned what's been going on in Sweden around Europe. Do you feel that's really sharp
*05:05.160- 05:11.240* :  and things up in terms of the medical response? Yes I think so. I mean we know that there will be
*05:11.240- 05:17.320* :  monitoring and surveillance and people are looking at their ability to test. They're looking at their
*05:17.660- 05:23.520* :  ability to trace people in the same way that they did through Covid you know when they did contact
*05:23.520- 05:30.000* :  tracing trying to keep track of who is where and who has what infection all those kind of measures
*05:30.000- 05:36.660* :  that were put in place will be very familiar to people I'm sure. So across Europe and across the
*05:36.660- 05:42.260* :  world I think public health officials will be noting what's happening in Africa and really
*05:43.080- 05:50.920* :  preparing for another outbreak like we saw in 2022-2023. You mentioned the outbreak then of course
*05:50.920- 05:56.160* :  Covid-19 occurred before that but do you feel lessons have been learned maybe in areas like
*05:56.160- 06:01.860* :  Europe which could be put into action here? What happened in that previous outbreak in 2022?
*06:02.640- 06:10.420* :  You know that affected I think it was 111 countries and we saw nearly 100,000 cases worldwide
*06:11.620- 06:17.860* :  and probably more in fact that weren't actually identified. So we have sort of been down this
*06:17.860- 06:22.700* :  road before particularly with MPOX and the things that made the difference then are the things that
*06:22.700- 06:30.180* :  I think will make the difference now. One is vaccines and two is behavioral change so trying to get
*06:30.180- 06:35.800* :  people to modify their behavior to reduce the risk that they could come into contact with this very
*06:35.800- 06:42.080* :  very infectious virus. The problem with MPOX is there is a period before you show any of the early
*06:42.080- 06:47.360* :  symptoms which are like basically flu-like symptoms before you develop these blisters on your
*06:47.360- 06:53.980* :  skin but even before that you can be contagious spread the virus to other people without knowing
*06:53.980- 06:58.140* :  your sick yourself and even then when you develop the flu-like symptoms you might just think well
*06:58.140- 07:03.300* :  I've got a bit of flu or I've got a bit of Covid or I've got a terrible cold and not realise
*07:03.300- 07:07.320* :  that you've got an impact so that's one of the real difficulties I think that public health officials
*07:07.320- 07:14.000* :  will be wrestling with. Dominic Hughes the United States has said there's been a promising start to
*07:14.000- 07:19.600* :  Gaza ceasefire talks but there's still a lot of work to do together with Egypt and Qatar
*07:19.600- 07:24.760* :  where the talks are being held the U.S. wants to choose not only to try to bring an end to the
*07:24.760- 07:31.220* :  suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and free the surviving Israeli hostages the pressures
*07:31.220- 07:37.640* :  also on the negotiators to get a ceasefire to stop Iran attacking Israel in revenge for the
*07:37.640- 07:44.180* :  assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haneyeh in Tehran two weeks ago however while Israeli
*07:44.180- 07:51.440* :  spy chiefs are in Qatar Hamas hasn't sent anyone. Vident Patel the U.S. State Department spokesman
*07:51.440- 07:56.980* :  said there was still close contact with Palestinian groups. There are representatives on the ground
*07:56.980- 08:03.120* :  there from Israel from the United States from Qatar and Egypt and Qatar and Egypt are as part of that
*08:03.120- 08:10.000* :  process are mediating with Hamas and so you heard me say a number of times this week that our partners
*08:10.000- 08:15.680* :  assured us that Hamas would be representative in one way shape reform and they certainly would be
*08:15.680- 08:21.800* :  part of the ongoing conversations which is probably necessary when we're talking about negotiations.
*08:21.820- 08:28.220* :  Hamas has said that any ceasefire must involve the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza
*08:28.980- 08:35.180* :  but Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to eliminate Hamas. Our correspondent
*08:35.180- 08:41.300* :  were a Davis is monitoring the negotiations from Jerusalem. These talks were meant to last for two
*08:41.300- 08:46.840* :  days that was the scheduled duration and their own confirmed report via a well-connected Israeli
*08:46.840- 08:52.280* :  journalist Barack Ravid that they have agreed to stay on for a second day and that is you know
*08:52.480- 08:56.720* :  when there has been very little progress in recent days and weeks that is as a good sign to the
*08:57.120- 09:02.720* :  Israeli and American negotiators who've been sent to Qatar are hopefully and it's been confirmed
*09:02.720- 09:07.020* :  going to stay on for a second day and of course the key thing here as you said in the introduction
*09:07.080- 09:13.060* :  is some signs of progress because we're the talks to collapse then there's a real danger that vacuum
*09:13.060- 09:18.860* :  could be filled by this Iranian promise this Iranian threat to follow through on its revenge so
*09:18.860- 09:23.780* :  any signs of progress are being grasped that by those international players who really want them
*09:24.060- 09:30.180* :  and why hasn't Hamas sent anyone to the talks? Well Hamas has never in the duration of these talks
*09:30.180- 09:36.120* :  of the last ten months never sat down directly with senior American figures. Hamas has accused Israel
*09:36.120- 09:42.160* :  of moving the goalposts particularly conditions says Hamas about the the free movement of Palestinians
*09:42.160- 09:47.980* :  within Gaza in the event of a ceasefire and also Israeli control over an area called the Philadelphia
*09:47.980- 09:53.860* :  corridor which is the area between Gaza and the Egyptian border. Now Israel says it hasn't changed
*09:53.860- 10:00.240* :  its demands but Hamas isn't physically present at the talks but of course Qatar is where most of
*10:00.240- 10:06.320* :  Hamas's leaders and exile are so they'll be aware of what's going on and the Qatari and Egyptian
*10:06.320- 10:11.800* :  negotiators will certainly keep Hamas officials in the loop. Well we've been here so many times what
*10:11.800- 10:16.720* :  hopes are there of a ceasefire? Do both sides really want one? Oh this is the big question that
*10:16.720- 10:22.180* :  there are hardliners on you know a new Hamas leadership in Yaya Sinwa and and far-right wing
*10:22.180- 10:27.500* :  ministers in the Israeli government who clearly perhaps don't want a ceasefire. Even Benjamin Netanyahu
*10:27.500- 10:32.620* :  himself talks about total victory and some of his ministers disagree with that saying now is the
*10:32.620- 10:37.980* :  time for compromise and you know you can have to compromise if there's to be a ceasefire, if those
*10:37.980- 10:44.480* :  120 or so Israeli hostages and the bodies of dead hostages are to be released. So there was a
*10:44.480- 10:47.800* :  lot of pressure particularly from the international community, from the American government,
*10:47.800- 10:51.860* :  from the British, the Germans and the French. We hear there may be ministerial visits by
*10:51.860- 10:57.480* :  high profile European figures in coming days to try and reach some sort of deal but these talks
*10:57.480- 11:02.600* :  in Qatar are talks about talks. We're not going to see in the next two days hostages release,
*11:02.600- 11:08.320* :  we're not going to see a ceasefire. The key thing in Qatar is to try and make progress around a
*11:08.380- 11:16.000* :  framework for future peace talks. We're a Davis. Five people including two doctors have been
*11:16.000- 11:20.900* :  charged in connection with the death of the actor Matthew Perry who was best known for his role in
*11:20.900- 11:27.680* :  the sitcom Friends. The 54-year-old was found dead in a hot tub at his home in Los Angeles last October
*11:28.220- 11:34.400* :  after taking the drug ketamine. Martin Estrada is the United States attorney for the central district
*11:34.400- 11:41.100* :  of California. These defendants took advantage of Mr. Perry's addiction issues to enrich
*11:41.100- 11:47.060* :  themselves. They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking
*11:47.100- 11:54.180* :  great danger to Mr. Perry but they did it anyways. In the end these defendants were more
*11:54.180- 12:00.980* :  interested in profiting off Mr. Perry than caring for his well-being. Our correspondent in Los Angeles
*12:00.980- 12:07.680* :  Peter Boes gave us this update. Five people have been charged and these are defendants who,
*12:08.220- 12:13.880* :  according to the authorities, took advantage of Matthew Perry's addiction issues to enrich
*12:13.880- 12:19.460* :  themselves. One of the key allegations is that they knew what they were doing. What they were
*12:19.460- 12:25.140* :  doing was wrong. It was potentially dangerous to Matthew Perry to use ketamine, which is the
*12:25.140- 12:31.860* :  drug in question, without any kind of medical supervision. One of those charged is a woman called
*12:31.900- 12:40.140* :  Jasmine Sanger. She lives in North Hollywood, sometimes described as the ketamine queen, allegedly
*12:40.140- 12:46.980* :  a drug dealer and she is alleged to have supplied the vials of the drug that were actually used
*12:47.100- 12:53.800* :  by Matthew Perry on the day of his death. There's another of the defendants, Dr. Salvador
*12:53.800- 13:00.620* :  Placencia. He is alleged to have been involved in this complicated web of individuals and
*13:00.620- 13:06.820* :  through the interception of text messages between these people, he is said to have speculated
*13:07.140- 13:13.160* :  about how much money Matthew Perry would actually pay for these drugs. Another of the defendants
*13:13.480- 13:21.160* :  is Kenneth Iwasmasa, who was the living personal assistant to Matthew Perry, who had various
*13:22.300- 13:28.120* :  responsibilities involving his care, but he is alleged to have been a go-between, also alleged to have
*13:28.120- 13:34.740* :  actually injected the drug himself on the day of Matthew Perry's death. And Peter, it's worrying
*13:34.740- 13:40.480* :  how easy it seems to be able to acquire the control drugs in the US. It is deeply worrying,
*13:40.480- 13:44.200* :  and I'm sure there are many people here in Los Angeles, indeed around the world who are
*13:44.200- 13:50.140* :  fans of Matthew Perry, Matthew Perry, the actor hugely lauded, of course, his role in friends.
*13:50.140- 13:54.820* :  Those will be deeply shocked, I think, by the extent of the detail that we've heard of the
*13:55.020- 14:00.700* :  alleged involvement of so many people. It is, as you imply, kind of widely known that there is
*14:00.700- 14:06.920* :  a huge problem with the abuse of prescription drugs in this country. And to quote one of the
*14:06.920- 14:13.320* :  individuals at the press conference, there are many who will play roulette with people's lives,
*14:13.320- 14:17.220* :  the implication being that, clearly, that's what was happening with Matthew Perry,
*14:17.220- 14:22.900* :  but many other people in this country are the victims of the misuse of prescription drugs,
*14:22.900- 14:28.900* :  because there are so many other alleged, at least in this case, alleged enablers around who
*14:28.900- 14:33.800* :  prepared a profit from the supply of these drugs. Peter Bowes
*14:35.060- 14:40.200* :  A new study has revealed people don't grow old gracefully, but in fits and starts.
*14:40.960- 14:46.200* :  Scientists at Stanford University School of Medicine in California found that the most dramatic
*14:46.200- 14:52.420* :  periods of aging come in your mid-40s and early 60s. John Donerson reports.
*14:53.620- 14:57.720* :  For those who've ever woken up feeling like they've dramatically aged overnight,
*14:57.720- 15:04.140* :  this study might provide some explanation. The Stanford team tracked more than 100 volunteers aged
*15:04.140- 15:12.240* :  between 25 and 75 for a period of up to six years. They monitored changes to more than 135,000
*15:12.240- 15:18.580* :  molecules in the human body, including those linked to cardiovascular disease, loss of muscle mass
*15:18.580- 15:24.440* :  and weight gain. The researchers detected two standout waves of age-related changes.
*15:25.000- 15:31.060* :  On average, the first occurred around the age of 44 and the second around the age of 60. Professor
*15:31.060- 15:36.180* :  Michael Snyder led the study. Most people think of people just gradually getting older,
*15:36.180- 15:42.540* :  but we looked at molecular and all kinds of changes going on in people, and we discovered that
*15:42.540- 15:46.940* :  there are dramatic changes that occur as people hit their 60s. That was sort of known before,
*15:46.940- 15:52.560* :  because many age-related diseases pop up 10. But I think the births that's happening around in the
*15:52.580- 15:58.080* :  mid-40s was quite unexpected, although in hindsight, it might make sense. Professor Snyder said
*15:58.080- 16:03.140* :  the mid-40s spike was initially assumed to be linked to the menopause, but the scientists
*16:03.140- 16:09.700* :  found similar shifts in men at the same age. The study suggested behavioral factors at certain times
*16:09.700- 16:15.340* :  of life could be significant. For example, increased alcohol consumption in your forties,
*16:15.680- 16:21.100* :  often considered a particularly stressful decade due to work and family pressures.
*16:21.780- 16:29.360* :  John Doniston reporting. Still to come. China has a high unemployment rate, particularly
*16:29.360- 16:35.360* :  amongst young people, and people really struggle to get jobs, and they really want to hold onto
*16:35.360- 16:42.000* :  jobs like this. Protests in China over a bike career pictured pleading on his knees before a security
*16:51.540- 16:51.560* :  god.
*16:51.640- 16:57.160* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundreds mid-commercials. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*16:57.160- 17:00.600* :  no, no, no, no, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.

*17:05.560- 17:10.240* :  two or three times that much? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim-blaming here. Give it a try at

*18:00.100- 18:07.080* :  A $50 donation made by a ballerina to a US-funded charity supporting Ukraine has landed her in
*18:07.080- 18:13.940* :  jail in Russia. Kiseña Carolina, who works in Los Angeles and holds dual US-Russian nationality,
*18:13.940- 18:20.120* :  was sentenced to 12 years in prison. She was visiting the city of Akaturimburg when she was arrested
*18:20.120- 18:25.780* :  in January. The Russian authorities accused her of raising money from an organization that provides
*18:25.780- 18:31.780* :  arms to the Ukrainian military. But John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman,
*18:31.780- 18:37.340* :  said that Kiseña Carolina was innocent of any crime. It's nothing less than just the
*18:37.340- 18:42.540* :  indicative cruelty. We're talking about 50 bucks to try to alleviate the suffering of
*18:42.860- 18:47.600* :  people of Ukraine. And to call that treason is just absolutely ludicrous.
*18:48.240- 18:53.420* :  Earlier this month, Russia and Western governments carried out the largest prisoner exchange since the
*18:53.420- 18:59.180* :  Cold War. Ms. Carolina's lawyer said she couldn't be included because at that stage, she hadn't
*18:59.180- 19:05.060* :  been sentenced. Her partner, the boxer, Chris van Hearden, said she should not have been left
*19:05.060- 19:10.580* :  behind. I'm angry with this state department because Kiseña was supposed to be part of the
*19:10.580- 19:15.360* :  swap that took place. I was putting a lot of pressure and I was slowed down and pushed back and
*19:15.360- 19:21.460* :  said, look, Chris, there will be no prison swap until after the election or even maybe early
*19:21.460- 19:27.140* :  next year. So we have time to get our ducks in a row. Guess what? We did not have time.
*19:28.040- 19:33.860* :  Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford about the case.
*19:34.560- 19:39.040* :  Just how extraordinary is the conviction and the sentence even by Russian standards?
*19:40.020- 19:45.200* :  I think it's first to say that even by the extremely repressive standards of Russia today,
*19:45.200- 19:50.680* :  this is extreme. I think had this happened in Russia, if she'd been in Russia and have made
*19:50.680- 19:57.500* :  a payment from inside Russia, it would be easier somehow to understand, although it would also
*19:58.060- 20:03.900* :  be a very, very harsh sentence. But this is a payment that Kiseña Carolina made whilst in the
*20:03.900- 20:09.800* :  United States as an American citizen to an organization based in the United States and supporting
*20:09.800- 20:16.320* :  Ukraine. The fact is that when she was back in Russia, she was treated of course as a Russian
*20:16.380- 20:20.320* :  citizen because her American passport doesn't count there and she was prosecuted under Russian law.
*20:21.120- 20:27.300* :  And even a payment made abroad is enough in Russia to get you convicted as a traitor.
*20:27.980- 20:35.420* :  So I think it is a deeply, deeply repressive environment. It is a society that has been
*20:36.180- 20:42.740* :  divided into patriots and traitors and enemies and allies for years now. And I'd say the
*20:43.300- 20:49.040* :  beginning of the peak was back in 2014 when Russia illegally annexed Ukraine. From then on,
*20:49.640- 20:55.160* :  it's been an escalating system of repression. And I think this kind of idea of, if you're not
*20:55.180- 21:01.000* :  withers, you're against us, has led to the laws on trees and being tightened and to convictions
*21:01.200- 21:05.600* :  and prosecutions like this one, although as I say, this is exceedingly harsh.
*21:05.860- 21:11.640* :  Her partner has told us that he's planning to appeal to the US State Department to get help for
*21:11.640- 21:17.620* :  this. But is there any hope of a successful appeal from within Russia? No, there is no chance that
*21:17.620- 21:22.520* :  this conviction would be overturned on appeal within the normal legal proceedings in Russia.
*21:23.720- 21:30.400* :  She will be serving that sentence unless she's able to get out some other way using her American
*21:30.400- 21:34.300* :  citizenship and any government pressure that's brought to bear. I mean, that is the reality.
*21:34.980- 21:38.420* :  And you know, bear in mind that when there was that big prisoner swap just a week or so ago,
*21:39.160- 21:43.280* :  there were dual citizens involved in that swap. And that is the problem if you're in Russia with
*21:43.280- 21:47.680* :  any other passport you are considered as a Russian citizen, your other passport doesn't count.
*21:47.680- 21:52.660* :  So there's no protection apart from if you're prosecuted, you might hope that the US government
*21:52.660- 21:59.360* :  can intercede and can negotiate for you. Does this decision today then give a nod to a new period
*21:59.360- 22:05.720* :  maybe of hostage diplomacy employed by Moscow? And what kind of message does that send to dual
*22:05.720- 22:11.440* :  nationals and even foreign nationals living in Russia at the moment? Well, I think the signal to
*22:11.440- 22:17.380* :  anyone in Russia is to be afraid. And I think that's what's deliberate. This is supposed to tell
*22:17.380- 22:24.100* :  people that if they don't support and act in support of the Russian government, the Russian
*22:24.100- 22:29.320* :  states and show any kind of dissent, then they are in danger and that their foreign passport
*22:29.320- 22:33.340* :  won't protect them if they have one. In terms of hostage diplomacy, well, you know,
*22:33.500- 22:37.340* :  the prisoner swap didn't start a couple of weeks ago. They have been happening on and off
*22:37.780- 22:43.280* :  very sporadically for some time. They take a huge amount of negotiation, discussion,
*22:43.280- 22:49.140* :  political will. And I think the chances of another swap coming anytime soon are
*22:49.140- 22:57.180* :  upwitty slim. Sarah Reinsford. DeGreece now, where wildfires have ravaged land at homes,
*22:57.180- 23:02.280* :  leading all the way up to the suburbs of Athens. These bladers are common in the southern
*23:02.280- 23:07.160* :  European country, but scientists say climate change is intensifying the problem.
*23:07.980- 23:12.460* :  Our correspondent Jessica Parker reports from the countryside just north of Athens,
*23:12.460- 23:15.820* :  where this fire broke out to speak to the people who live there.
*23:17.640- 23:24.080* :  On burnt out, hilly scrubland, two men are hoisted up a thick wooden mast, replacing destroyed
*23:24.080- 23:35.140* :  power lines. A nearby is the town of Vanavus. It's in this area where Sunday's wildfire began.
*23:38.480- 23:47.060* :  It is an apocalyptic looking scene. These hillsides are now blanketed in dark grey ash and soil.
*23:47.840- 23:53.480* :  Some of the pine trees have survived, but lots of them have basically been reduced to what
*23:53.480- 24:01.500* :  looked like blackened matchsticks protruding from the earth. In a cafe, but Avas, I meet Georgia, a young
*24:01.500- 24:11.200* :  mum. We thought that they would grow up in green area, perfect climate with good temperatures,
*24:11.200- 24:19.980* :  but now the temperatures are very high, so 40 degrees or two months now. So it's very high for us.
*24:19.980- 24:27.480* :  We are not used to that, even for Greece. We love summer, but not like that. Do you think Greece
*24:27.480- 24:33.220* :  and the world is doing enough about climate change? Of course not. We're doing everything to destroy
*24:33.220- 24:41.320* :  the whole planet, but you'll stay in this area? You don't have that choice always. If your house
*24:41.320- 24:50.320* :  is here, if your friends, your family were to go, the fire went until a pedele and
*24:50.540- 24:59.420* :  relisha, relisha, halandri, that's nothing. It's not a mountain like here, it's nothing.
*25:02.400- 25:07.560* :  Her partner, George, is also in the bar. He's a volunteer firefighter and was among the
*25:07.560- 25:14.140* :  hundreds to tackle the flames. It was like hell, it was like a lack of war, everywhere, fire,
*25:14.740- 25:25.680* :  panic everywhere. It was like windy day and we didn't have water to refill our trucks or our vehicles.
*25:29.700- 25:36.560* :  In a mayor's office in the nearby seaside town of Nea McCree, spokesman Stelios Markakis says
*25:36.560- 25:42.320* :  depleting water reserves are a huge concern for Greece. He highlights tourism as something
*25:42.320- 25:47.840* :  that's draining resources. All over the world there's a discussion about that. We need a sustainable
*25:51.720- 25:56.900* :  tourism. Firefighting aircraft continue to circle in the skies. Mitigation measures like
*25:56.900- 26:02.840* :  clearing land of flammable materials such as dead leaves and branches are becoming more stringent.
*26:03.420- 26:08.300* :  On a bigger scale, Greece's Prime Minister today said the climate crisis required a collective
*26:08.300- 26:15.280* :  effort, but here many are worried as a hot sun continues to beat down on the tinder dryer.
*26:17.620- 26:22.300* :  Jessica Parker reporting to China now.
*26:29.100- 26:34.380* :  A huge crowd of delivery riders demonstrate outside a building in Dantan Hangzhou,
*26:34.380- 26:40.580* :  in eastern China. Their anger had been sparked by pictures of a bite courier kneeling at the feet
*26:40.580- 26:47.140* :  of a security guard outside the building. I heard more about what led up to the protest from our
*26:47.140- 26:53.240* :  China media analyst, Kerry Allen. This all went back to Monday when this delivery driver
*26:53.240- 26:58.720* :  went to a building in Hangzhou, which is a city in eastern China, and he was stopped by a security guard
*26:58.780- 27:03.680* :  who told him that he damaged railings, scaling them during a rush delivery. And as a result,
*27:03.680- 27:08.920* :  the takeaway rider got down on his knees and he was trying to plead with the security guard
*27:09.200- 27:15.000* :  because he said he was worried about this affecting his job and this image went viral because a lot
*27:15.000- 27:20.840* :  of people started gathering round. They saw this happening and the images appeared online videos as
*27:20.880- 27:26.720* :  well and it led to a lot of anger about the idea that a delivery driver would be treated in such a
*27:26.780- 27:30.860* :  way that he literally be getting down begging just to be able to get out and do his job.
*27:30.860- 27:36.700* :  So it sort of struck a raw nerve, do you think? It did, yes, because there have been videos in the past
*27:36.740- 27:43.760* :  of people doing jobs like this, but almost being subjected to degrading experiences. So in the
*27:43.760- 27:48.600* :  past, I've seen similar kind of behavior, you know, managers getting staff to kind of kneel down,
*27:48.600- 27:54.520* :  cout out to their boss, literally get down on their knees and worship their boss almost. And there
*27:54.520- 27:58.840* :  is a bit of concern about it in China that this kind of behavior happens. And what's been the reaction
*27:58.880- 28:03.160* :  on social media to it? What's really interesting about this is that there's been images that have
*28:03.160- 28:08.120* :  appeared on foreign social media platforms today like X, the platform that used to be Twitter,
*28:08.580- 28:13.180* :  showing the other delivery drivers have come out and protest in Hangzhou. Now the reason I mentioned
*28:13.180- 28:19.380* :  that they've appeared on X is because in China, any gatherings of people protesting are automatically
*28:19.380- 28:25.200* :  blocked because China doesn't want any shows of descent online, but people are aware of them.
*28:25.200- 28:29.600* :  They've been seeing these images on way, but before they've been taken down, these drivers have
*28:29.600- 28:34.460* :  been wanting to protest about this incident and they're asking, well, what's going to happen? Are
*28:34.460- 28:39.460* :  the drivers likely to lose their jobs because of this? Are they going to be punished? There's a
*28:39.460- 28:44.260* :  bit concern about the, as they perceive, the upper class and the way they treat the lower class in
*28:44.260- 28:50.060* :  China. And I think especially these kind of gig economy workers because China has a high unemployment
*28:50.060- 28:56.460* :  rate, particularly amongst young people. And people really struggle to get jobs and they really want
*28:56.460- 29:01.140* :  to hold onto jobs like this. In fact, actually a lot of delivery driver jobs actually ask for a
*29:01.140- 29:05.260* :  master's degree. So the idea that these might just be young people just trying to make a bit of
*29:05.260- 29:10.560* :  money and really struggling just to actually do their job because of all of these systematic rules.
*29:11.140- 29:13.720* :  It's really triggered a conversation that I don't think it's going to go away.
*29:14.440- 29:22.580* :  Kerry Allen. Post-Elimpics stress disorder. The games are all over and as the razzamata's fades
*29:22.580- 29:29.580* :  and the Olympic torch moves on, what do those who've twisted every sinew do now? Even the
*29:29.580- 29:35.860* :  biggest stars have talked about depression and anxiety setting in. Simon Jack talked to Adam
*29:35.860- 29:43.960* :  Burgess, team GB canoeist who won a silver in Paris, and to Dr Karen Halls, a lecturer in sports
*29:43.960- 29:49.560* :  psychology at Cardiff Metropolitan University, who's researched the post-Elimpic Blues.
*29:50.480- 29:55.260* :  She started by outlining some of the issues for athletes after the massive adjustment following
*29:55.260- 30:00.960* :  the games. Loss of purpose. Don't know what to do with themselves. A realisation that actually
*30:00.960- 30:06.460* :  nothing's changed and that has a real impact on their wellbeing. Adam, do you recognise some of
*30:06.460- 30:11.620* :  that? I mean, I'm guessing having won a silver medal, the euphoria still with you, is it draining
*30:11.620- 30:17.080* :  away? What's your experience? Still very much on cloud nine. Kind of looking forward to life
*30:17.080- 30:22.900* :  to returning a bit more normality soon, hopefully. But I mean, I know it's going to hit at some point
*30:22.900- 30:27.300* :  I have a very different experience coming home from Tokyo. There's a quote I tell you from
*30:27.300- 30:33.460* :  call runnings that I love where, yes, his coach, how will I know if I'm enough when I'm stood
*30:33.460- 30:38.660* :  up on that podium? And his coach said, you'll know because if you're not enough without the medal,
*30:38.920- 30:43.520* :  you'll never be enough with it. And for me, that's something that I think just sums it up so
*30:43.520- 30:49.480* :  well that, you know, you need to be happy with your life outside of sport. Their amazing experiences
*30:49.480- 30:53.380* :  that we can have, but yeah, ultimately we have to come back down to earth eventually.
*30:53.860- 30:59.420* :  Yeah, and when they do have to come down to earth at Karen, what kind of post event
*31:00.420- 31:05.580* :  help is there available? I think the individual national governing bodies provide
*31:05.820- 31:13.760* :  sport psychology support. I suppose it's the four to six weeks after the games when some of the
*31:13.760- 31:19.520* :  formal network that the athletes might have utilised before the games have gone.
*31:19.800- 31:24.320* :  The last couple of days started to think that, you know, I could really do with a bit of routine,
*31:24.700- 31:28.140* :  you know, with so well looked after in that build up, even like the little things like,
*31:28.440- 31:32.320* :  you know, our food all provided in the hotel or limited village. Now we've got to cook for ourselves
*31:32.320- 31:37.680* :  again. Karen, this is something that affects even the greatest Olympians of all time, you know,
*31:37.680- 31:44.100* :  the Simone Biles of the world, Adam Petey. They've described about problems with depression, anxiety
*31:44.100- 31:48.740* :  whatever. What is your advice to other Olympians who might be struggling?
*31:49.200- 31:54.540* :  So I think the first thing is understanding that this is normal. I've not yet met an Olympian
*31:54.540- 32:01.380* :  who hasn't experienced a blues at all. Second, have something else in place to do, engaging
*32:01.380- 32:06.920* :  as something other than the sport just to keep them occupied. And I think the third thing is about
*32:06.920- 32:13.240* :  social support and the the Olympians that we spoke to really appreciated support from others
*32:13.240- 32:19.600* :  who've been through it more than support from sports psychologists and really those who know
*32:19.600- 32:25.440* :  what you're going through are those who competed as well. Dr Karen Howles and Adam Burgess.
*32:28.320- 32:32.980* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
