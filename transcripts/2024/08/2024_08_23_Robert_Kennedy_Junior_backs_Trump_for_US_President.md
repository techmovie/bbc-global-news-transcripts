*01:37.140- 01:42.240* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and in the early hours of Saturday, the 24th of August, these are our main
*01:42.240- 01:48.880* :  stories. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. suspends his bid for the US presidency, and back's Donald Trump.
*01:48.880- 01:54.300* :  A trial is underway of a vaccine for lung cancer using the technology that produced leading
*01:54.300- 02:00.940* :  COVID vaccines. Authorities in Bangladesh are continuing efforts to evacuate areas in the country's
*02:01.040- 02:06.660* :  east, affected by flash floods. Awesome as podcast.
*02:13.660- 02:22.680* :  Not a glitch, but the sound of 1970s computer game pong. Now scientists have taught a blob of jelly to play it.
*02:25.840- 02:30.860* :  He is a sign of the Kennedys, the most famous political family in the United States,
*02:30.860- 02:36.280* :  who produced a Democratic president in John F. Kennedy, and an attorney general in
*02:36.280- 02:43.220* :  Robert F. Kennedy. Last year, his son, RFK Jr., broke away from the Democratic party to announce
*02:43.220- 02:49.500* :  he was running as an independent candidate for the US presidency. Now he suspended his electoral
*02:49.500- 02:55.480* :  campaign and thrown his support behind Donald Trump. Giving a speech in Arizona, Mr. Kennedy,
*02:55.480- 02:59.500* :  who suffers from a disorder that affects his voice, explained his reasons.
*03:00.180- 03:04.860* :  The Democratic disease crisis was one of the primary reasons for my running for president,
*03:05.560- 03:11.560* :  along with ending censorship in the Ukraine war. It's the reason I've made the heart-wrenching decision
*03:12.540- 03:16.700* :  to suspend my campaign and to support President Trump.
*03:17.520- 03:23.880* :  He also said the Democratic party had departed dramatically from the core values he grew up with.
*03:24.380- 03:29.300* :  The decision has appalled five of RFK Jr. siblings who've issued a joint statement
*03:29.300- 03:34.980* :  denouncing their brother's decision, describing it as a betrayal of the values of their family.
*03:35.640- 03:40.640* :  This was Donald Trump's response. He's really a terrific guy. I've had a long-term friendship
*03:40.640- 03:46.700* :  with him. He's a very talented person. It's an honor. He just announced, and to great
*03:46.700- 03:53.420* :  honor really is. I asked our correspondent in the US, David Willis, about RFK Jr.'s decision.
*03:54.180- 04:00.240* :  Not long ago, it would have been deemed virtually inconceivable that a member of one of the most
*04:00.240- 04:07.120* :  storied families in US Democratic politics would join forces with Donald Trump in an effort to
*04:07.440- 04:14.400* :  keep a Democrat out of the White House. Indeed, only last month, text messages emerged in which
*04:14.400- 04:21.600* :  Mr. Kennedy referred to Mr. Trump as a terrible human being and probably a sociopath. Mr. Trump
*04:21.600- 04:28.740* :  called Mr. Kennedy a radical left lunatic, so having started his campaign as a Democrat,
*04:28.740- 04:34.760* :  competing against Joe Biden, then leaving the party last autumn to run as an independent,
*04:34.760- 04:41.960* :  Mr. Kennedy has now endorsed the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. He made the announcement
*04:41.960- 04:49.320* :  in Phoenix, Arizona. Donald Trump is due to hold a rally not far from there, and speculation is
*04:49.320- 04:56.820* :  that he could be joined at that rally by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Now, RFK Jr. is going to move
*04:56.820- 05:02.140* :  his name from the ballot in some states and remain as a candidate in others. How could that help
*05:02.140- 05:07.560* :  Donald Trump? Well, you're absolutely right. He said today that he was suspending his campaign
*05:07.560- 05:14.160* :  not ending it, and that means that his name will, as you say, remain on the ballot in states
*05:14.780- 05:20.560* :  that are unlikely to sway the outcome. In other words, in the non-crucial so-called swing
*05:20.560- 05:26.200* :  states, although there are reports that it may be too late for him to take his name off the ballot
*05:26.200- 05:32.860* :  in some of those key swing states. But discussions between the two campaigns have, by all accounts,
*05:32.860- 05:39.600* :  been taking place for several months, and there are also reports of unrequited obitures between
*05:39.600- 05:47.040* :  the Kennedy camp and that of Kamala Harris. Donald Trump has said that he would be open to
*05:47.040- 05:52.660* :  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. playing a role in his administration, if he's elected, although
*05:53.220- 05:58.000* :  it's not clear at the moment what, if any, promises of the Trump campaign is actually made.
*05:58.840- 06:01.600* :  And, David, how worried is the Democratic Party about this?
*06:02.440- 06:07.420* :  Not greatly, I would imagine, well, to be frank, Robert Kennedy Jr.'s campaign was thought to
*06:07.420- 06:13.120* :  be making more inroads into Donald Trump's support than that of Kamala Harris, and his
*06:13.120- 06:19.300* :  endorsement of Mr. Trump is likely to lead to a slight bump for the former president, but not one
*06:19.340- 06:25.740* :  that is expected to have a significant effect. His campaign has struggled, of course, for support,
*06:25.740- 06:30.920* :  as well as donations, particularly since Kamala Harris entered the presidential race.
*06:31.360- 06:38.080* :  And from an average of around 15 percent in the summer, RFK's poll numbers have fallen to
*06:38.080- 06:45.180* :  around 4 percent since then. That said, well, a tiny bump could have something of an impact
*06:45.720- 06:48.700* :  in a race as close as this we will have to wait and see.
*06:49.280- 06:55.360* :  David Willis in the United States. Across the world, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer
*06:55.360- 07:01.080* :  related deaths. It kills around 2 million people a year. Survival rates of those with advanced
*07:01.080- 07:06.960* :  forms of the disease are particularly poor, but now a new vaccine, which uses the same technology
*07:06.960- 07:12.200* :  as the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines, has given some hope to those with the disease.
*07:12.580- 07:18.440* :  A trial is underway with 130 people taking part from seven countries, including the US,
*07:18.440- 07:25.500* :  the UK and Turkey. Professors Siyah Mingli from the University College Hospital in London
*07:25.940- 07:30.120* :  is leading the trial in the UK, and he's excited about this new vaccine.
*07:30.860- 07:36.960* :  The patient we treated, he had stage 3 lung cancer, so he just completed a course of radiation
*07:37.020- 07:42.820* :  in chemotherapy. So we're adding in this mRNA cancer vaccine. I hope it's a big change,
*07:43.340- 07:50.240* :  just don't forget, we used our first COVID vaccine less than four years ago. We heard this mRNA
*07:50.240- 07:53.600* :  cancer technology can be transferred to our cancer population.
*07:54.700- 07:57.820* :  I health editor Michelle Roberts told me more about the vaccine.
*07:58.580- 08:02.580* :  It's experimental at the moment, so these are early trials to see that it's safe,
*08:02.580- 08:08.780* :  but what the hope is is it will be effective too. So this is kind of a new way that scientists are
*08:08.780- 08:13.740* :  looking at tackling the disease, because we know a lot of people do get cancer, sadly, and although
*08:13.740- 08:19.520* :  we have things like chemotherapy, which can help, they do have side effects, and doesn't always
*08:19.520- 08:24.920* :  tackle all of the cancer or remove the whole lot. These vaccines, this one, in particular,
*08:24.920- 08:30.380* :  is looking at the most common type of lung cancer, so non-small cell lung cancer,
*08:30.900- 08:38.080* :  and it gives some instructions to the body's own immune system to seek out those cells and destroy
*08:38.080- 08:45.740* :  them. So who could this help? At the moment, they are recruiting people to take part who've already
*08:45.740- 08:51.940* :  been diagnosed with lung cancer, and who've tried various treatments, and sadly, the cancer's still
*08:52.000- 08:58.900* :  there. In the future, it's possible either it would be an additional treatment, so one of the
*08:58.900- 09:05.520* :  researchers who's been testing it says it would be an additional immune boost, but whether it would be
*09:06.100- 09:10.300* :  ever at the point where it could just be given and nothing else, that's a big question mark.
*09:10.520- 09:16.680* :  Lung cancer is still the world's leading cause of deaths from cancer, isn't it? Even though we know
*09:16.680- 09:24.060* :  the risks from, say, smoking, why is it still so prevalent? It has been shown that smoking can cause
*09:24.060- 09:31.440* :  lung cancer. That's well known now. It's not the only cause, but it's the major one. So if you are a
*09:31.440- 09:37.000* :  smoker and you're thinking about giving up, I mean, what researchers now know is that if you quit
*09:37.020- 09:43.600* :  after about 15 years, your risk of lung cancer is about the same as a non-smoker. How excited
*09:43.600- 09:49.120* :  are scientists about it? About this new vaccine. About the vaccine? Yeah, they are excited. I mean,
*09:49.120- 09:55.440* :  it fits into this whole new therapy area that we're seeing for various cancers, and it could be a
*09:55.440- 10:01.260* :  really neat way of tackling the disease. And when, why we see it being used, because this is a trial
*10:01.260- 10:05.260* :  at the moment, isn't it? So this is what you call a phase one trial. It's the very first step of
*10:05.260- 10:11.180* :  testing it in people. After that, you need bigger trials again, and then it needs to go through all
*10:11.180- 10:16.960* :  the regulators and the checks and measures. So as always, we talk about years, not weeks or months,
*10:16.960- 10:23.420* :  but people are getting it through these trials now. Michel Roberts. The authorities in Bangladesh
*10:23.420- 10:28.080* :  showed desperately trying to evacuate areas in the east of the country, which have been
*10:28.080- 10:32.920* :  inundated by flash floods. More than four and a half million people have been affected
*10:32.920- 10:39.140* :  with their homes left underwater. At the time of recording this podcast, Bangladesh officials say
*10:39.140- 10:45.600* :  15 people have died, and many more are injured. Over the border, in the Indian state of Trapura,
*10:45.600- 10:52.280* :  the number of dead is at least 23. The region of Feny in Southeast Bangladesh is one of the worst
*10:52.280- 11:02.580* :  areas. That's the sign of families waiting through the flood water, carrying children and the
*11:02.580- 11:09.220* :  elderly on improvised rafts. Raki lives in Feny until the BBC, the situation there, is desperate.
*11:10.140- 11:17.380* :  Nearly 15 to 20 meters of the localities already submerged under the water. People are taking
*11:17.380- 11:26.720* :  shelter over the roof, over various infrastructure. Many of them, they're even taking shelter at the top
*11:26.720- 11:32.760* :  of the tree. People, those who have already took shelter in different parts of the areas,
*11:33.640- 11:38.300* :  they are not getting enough food. Already many of the flood affected people,
*11:38.540- 11:46.060* :  they are facing many water-related disease. Our correspondent, Akbar Hussein, gave us this update
*11:46.060- 11:52.340* :  from the capital Dhaka. I have visited several flood-affected villages yesterday, and I have
*11:52.340- 11:57.960* :  talked to many people, and they were very shocked to see the severity of the flood and the destruction
*11:57.960- 12:03.260* :  caused by the floods. And people are saying that they haven't seen this level of destruction
*12:03.260- 12:09.180* :  caused by the flood in the last 40 years. And according to the government statistics, around 5
*12:09.180- 12:14.000* :  million people are being affected in 12 districts. And Bangladesh government has deployed
*12:14.000- 12:20.400* :  army and navy to evacuate people and to reach them for distributing reliefs. But the situation
*12:20.400- 12:26.720* :  is still very volatile there, and because there is no communications, mobile and internet remains
*12:26.720- 12:32.120* :  disabled for the last several days. The people who have relatives in that area, they cannot talk
*12:32.120- 12:38.220* :  to the people. So the line of communication is completely destructed in that area. Many people
*12:38.220- 12:43.460* :  in Bangladesh, they are blaming India because of the flood, because they say that the flood caused
*12:43.460- 12:48.640* :  because of India suddenly opened a hydraulic dam in three-poor approvines. So Bangladesh's chief
*12:48.640- 12:53.320* :  advisor, who is running the government professor Muhammad Yunos, he held a meeting yesterday with
*12:53.320- 12:57.720* :  the Indian High Commissioner Dhaka, and he said that Bangladesh and India should find a mechanism
*12:57.720- 13:02.980* :  for a high level cooperation so that they can tackle flood in coming days.
*13:03.580- 13:09.100* :  Akbar Hussein, flooding in the region is common during monsoon season, Bangladesh is
*13:09.100- 13:14.180* :  crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers. But scientists say climate change is making extreme weather
*13:14.180- 13:18.000* :  events more deadly, as Stav Deneas from BBC Weather explains.
*13:18.000- 13:23.740* :  It's very vulnerable, also to its low-lying and flat topography. This combined with sediment
*13:23.740- 13:29.020* :  erosion, also higher up in the Himalayas, which runs down the river basins, clogs up river systems,
*13:29.540- 13:34.520* :  means that flooding is more common around rivers. They can break their banks more easily.
*13:34.960- 13:40.380* :  And also this combined with very high population, the high density and socio-economic
*13:40.380- 13:45.360* :  environment, made Bangladesh very susceptible to particularly flooding. With climate change,
*13:45.720- 13:51.260* :  increasing temperatures across the globe, the climate can hold more moisture, and this will give rise
*13:51.260- 13:54.300* :  to more extreme rainfall in certain prone areas.
*13:54.900- 14:01.280* :  Stav Deneas, the new deadly strain of epochs is rapidly spreading across parts of Africa,
*14:01.280- 14:07.920* :  leading to a surge in infections. The highly contagious disease has killed at least 450 people
*14:07.920- 14:12.980* :  in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the World Health Organization has called for global action
*14:12.980- 14:19.220* :  to combat the outbreak. Our correspondent, Mercy Juma, has been to Burundi, a small country which
*14:19.220- 14:26.980* :  borders the DRC, and which has already confirmed more than 170 cases of epochs. She sent us this report
*14:26.980- 14:33.680* :  from Burundi's largest city, Pujampura. In one of Burundi's largest epochs,
*14:33.700- 14:38.820* :  isolation centers, 59 of the available 61 beds are occupied by infected patients.
*14:39.640- 14:44.600* :  A thud are under the age of 15. Hospital staff are walking tirelessly to offer treatment,
*14:45.240- 14:48.200* :  as well as create more space and anticipation of new arrivals.
*14:48.980- 14:54.200* :  Ejid Irambuna, who's 40, tested positive and has been in the treatment center for nine days.
*14:56.080- 15:01.020* :  I had swollen lymph nodes. You are so painful, I couldn't sleep.
*15:02.200- 15:09.400* :  Then the pain subsided up here, and it moved to my legs. But I am better now.
*15:10.920- 15:15.360* :  Medical officials in Burundi are not only concerned about a lack of awareness of the
*15:15.360- 15:21.280* :  dangers of the disease, but also the limited resources available to fight it. There is only one
*15:21.280- 15:25.780* :  testing laboratory in the whole country, in sufficient testing kits, and no vaccines.
*15:26.880- 15:30.520* :  The National Direct of the Center for Public Health Emergency Operations,
*15:30.520- 15:36.740* :  Dr. Lilian Kengurutsi, says they need more than 10 million pounds to improve their testing
*15:38.960- 15:43.600* :  capabilities. The fact that diagnosis is only done in one place, this delay is detecting new
*15:43.600- 15:48.140* :  cases. Health centers are calling the laboratory saying they have suspected cases,
*15:48.760- 15:52.940* :  but it takes time for teams from the lab to deploy to where the suspected cases are to take
*15:52.960- 15:59.140* :  samples. And it takes even more time to release the test results. One of the poorest countries in
*15:59.140- 16:03.660* :  the world, Burundi borders the east of the Democratic Republic of Kengur, where the current
*16:03.660- 16:11.040* :  impacts outbreak began. Despite no recorded deaths here yet, at least 170 people are infected,
*16:11.700- 16:19.140* :  and that number is expected to rise. Mercy, Juma. Still to calm in this podcast?

*17:51.760- 17:57.920* :  dollar scam from the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. It convinced unsuspecting victims to put money
*17:57.920- 18:03.640* :  into investment platforms. It controlled. Six members of the group who returned to China have
*18:03.640- 18:09.540* :  been convicted by a Chinese court. Anko Shah is the editor of the BBC's Global China Unit,
*18:09.540- 18:16.460* :  and he told Tim Franks about the racket. This was a pig butchering scam. This term refers to
*18:16.460- 18:21.340* :  building up trust with the victim, so the scammer strike a relationship, a friendship. It might
*18:21.340- 18:26.660* :  even involve romance. In this case, though, it was all about trust. And what they did was they
*18:26.660- 18:32.380* :  fattened up their victims, if you like, before they striked. And striking, that meant convincing
*18:32.380- 18:37.500* :  their target to put money into investment platforms. And these were platforms controlled by the
*18:37.500- 18:41.580* :  scamming company. Who were they scouting? Was this British people? Was this Chinese people?
*18:41.880- 18:46.740* :  This was Chinese people. People all in China, the court documents, which were a very key source
*18:46.740- 18:52.720* :  for us. They identified six scammers who were also Chinese, but the victims, they were at least
*18:52.720- 18:57.160* :  a dozen of them. They were also Chinese. So it was Chinese scammers targeting Chinese victims.
*18:57.160- 19:03.020* :  But out of the Isle of Man. Why? I mean, how did that work? We can only speculate why they chose
*19:03.020- 19:07.820* :  the Isle of Man, but just zooming out into this kind of pig butchering industry. It's typically
*19:07.820- 19:14.140* :  been concentrated in Southeast Asia, countries like Myanmar, Lao, Philippines, Cambodia. This is,
*19:14.600- 19:18.920* :  and this is the words of a UN expert, the first such case they've seen of one of these operations
*19:18.920- 19:24.000* :  from a Western territory. In our research, we have actually seen these scam gangs that are run by
*19:24.000- 19:29.100* :  Chinese criminals moving to Zambia to the United Arab Emirates. So they are sort of popping up,
*19:29.100- 19:33.400* :  if you like. The same UN expert actually described it as a kind of game of whack-a-mull.
*19:33.400- 19:38.720* :  Once one of these kind of syndicates is clamped down on, they just pop up in another location,
*19:39.180- 19:41.920* :  possibly one where, you know, regulation might be lighter.
*19:42.200- 19:48.140* :  Dozens of people were involved from what I've read of your investigation in this particular scam
*19:48.140- 19:51.660* :  run out of the Isle of Man? Did they have a cover story for why they were all there?
*19:52.100- 19:57.040* :  It's very difficult to establish. I mean, one of the insiders that we spoke to, he moved to
*19:57.040- 20:01.160* :  the Isle of Man. He thought he was going to have a kind of stable administrative job,
*20:01.160- 20:06.080* :  and he didn't realise the murky world he was getting into. So there was definitely a level of secrecy
*20:06.080- 20:11.640* :  that we can see within this company. Is there a sort of sense that this is something that is
*20:11.640- 20:19.000* :  happening outside China because the authorities in China are sort of reasonably adept at clamping
*20:19.000- 20:24.520* :  down on this? Yeah, I mean, not just the authorities, but all the way across sort of state media.
*20:24.900- 20:29.100* :  There's a lot of messaging warning Chinese citizens that when they travel abroad,
*20:29.100- 20:34.180* :  they need to be careful, they need to not take on kind of easy money jobs. A lot of the initial
*20:34.180- 20:38.420* :  victims that's going back a few years were lured to companies like Myanmar, as I mentioned earlier.
*20:38.940- 20:42.920* :  So there's definitely that level of messaging. That's why they perhaps initially spread to
*20:42.920- 20:47.660* :  Southeast Asia. And once those groups in Southeast Asia have been targeted or clamped down on,
*20:47.660- 20:51.940* :  as we've seen in the Philippines, actually, that's perhaps why they're starting to spread further
*20:51.940- 20:58.600* :  afield. So it's being warned about in China. How openly is it being reported in China? I mean,
*20:58.600- 21:04.020* :  you said that you had access to court documents, which is interesting because six of these people
*21:04.020- 21:08.540* :  who are involved in this have been convicted. Is there a sense that there's sort of, you know,
*21:08.540- 21:12.960* :  the Chinese authorities are being relatively open about this or that there is transnational
*21:13.420- 21:18.300* :  even police cooperation? I would say that they're definitely being very open about this. I mean,
*21:18.300- 21:22.760* :  it's such a widespread concern for these citizens. The number of people that have been targeted
*21:22.760- 21:28.000* :  by these gangs is an absolute concern. And we can't say for sure about that sort of transnational
*21:28.000- 21:33.160* :  cooperation between police forces, but certainly from experts that we've spoken to, they do believe
*21:33.160- 21:38.260* :  this is the case. And Kurshah, editor of the BBC's global China unit.
*21:39.320- 21:44.600* :  Russian special forces have stormed a jail and shot and killed inmates who'd armed themselves
*21:44.600- 21:50.580* :  with knives and taken prison guards hostage. The prisoners at a maximum security penal colony
*21:50.580- 21:55.800* :  in the southern Volga-Grad region had declared their affiliation with the Islamic state group.
*21:56.280- 21:58.000* :  From Moscow, Steve Rosenberg reports.
*21:58.900- 22:05.780* :  IK-19 is a maximum security penal colony. And yet somehow, four inmates were able to arm
*22:05.780- 22:11.060* :  themselves with knives and go on the attack. They released gruesome mobile phone footage
*22:11.520- 22:16.860* :  showing prison officials lying in pools of blood, at least four prison staff were killed.
*22:17.720- 22:23.260* :  The attackers identify themselves as Islamic state militants. They'd also taken hostages.
*22:24.140- 22:29.460* :  Later, Russian special forces stormed the prison, shot dead, the four armed convicts,
*22:29.800- 22:35.040* :  and freed the hostages. Just over two months ago, something similar happened at another Russian
*22:35.040- 22:42.000* :  prison in Rostov-Ondon. Inmates accused of links to the Islamic state group took hostages,
*22:42.420- 22:46.340* :  special forces stormed the facility to end that siege too.
*22:47.040- 22:52.560* :  The head of the Volga-Grad region health committee Anatoly Sebelev said local health providers
*22:53.060- 22:57.920* :  and emergency services organizations were dealing with anyone injured in the attack.
*23:02.760- 23:05.520* :  Operations are being conducted at the district hospital.
*23:06.360- 23:10.400* :  There's sufficient amount of medicines, bandages, and blood components for the injured.
*23:11.180- 23:13.140* :  Assistance to the injured is under control.
*23:13.900- 23:18.620* :  The authorities in Volga-Grad said at least four prison staff were hospitalised.
*23:19.940- 23:24.040* :  The Paris 2024 Paralympics get underway next Wednesday.
*23:24.040- 23:29.920* :  The games include an intellectual impairment class, as well as athletes with physical impairments.
*23:30.400- 23:34.020* :  But in past games fewer than one in four countries taking part,
*23:34.360- 23:37.020* :  have brought athletes with an intellectual impairment.
*23:37.780- 23:41.460* :  Dan Pepper himself a former Paralympian in the intellectual impairment class
*23:41.940- 23:43.500* :  has been trying to find out why.
*23:45.020- 23:49.980* :  India is one of the countries that never sent an athlete with an intellectual impairment
*23:49.980- 23:52.200* :  to the games until now.
*23:53.220- 23:58.300* :  I've come to India to meet their first ever Paralympian with an intellectual impairment
*23:58.680- 23:59.900* :  and to hear her story.
*24:00.980- 24:04.820* :  My name is Deepti Ji Wanjit. My event is 400 metres.
*24:05.980- 24:08.640* :  Deepti comes from a rural part in the south of India.
*24:09.460- 24:13.200* :  When she was 12, a coach spotted her talent for running.
*24:14.180- 24:16.220* :  They brought her here to hide and to trade.
*24:17.460- 24:20.420* :  When you found that you were good at running,
*24:21.220- 24:25.560* :  how did that feel to find something that you were good at?
*24:25.920- 24:26.880* :  I'm the one, I feel it.
*24:28.020- 24:32.620* :  She says, I felt good. She says, I won one.
*24:33.420- 24:36.680* :  So it gave me confidence, I can win one more.
*24:37.280- 24:41.960* :  Once she was here, she started to struggle to understand some of her training.
*24:42.680- 24:45.620* :  One of her coaches thought she might have an intellectual impairment.
*24:46.300- 24:50.040* :  After Deepti was assessed, she qualified for the T20 class,
*24:50.600- 24:52.820* :  which is for people with an intellectual impairment.
*24:54.220- 24:58.060* :  At first, Deepti's mother reacted negatively to the news.
*25:00.700- 25:04.340* :  She says, I felt very bad about it.
*25:04.920- 25:07.940* :  When Rameshwar, who is Deepti's coach now,
*25:08.300- 25:12.080* :  moved Deepti to Parasports, I told him,
*25:12.080- 25:16.240* :  why are you changing my daughter from main sports to Parasports?
*25:17.080- 25:24.540* :  Then Rameshwar told me, she is not able to compete and get better every time.
*25:25.180- 25:27.960* :  That is why we sent her to the medical team.
*25:28.840- 25:30.280* :  Now she is good at running.
*25:30.280- 25:33.640* :  This sports, even Parasports is also very good.
*25:34.460- 25:35.960* :  That's how he convinced me.
*25:37.240- 25:42.880* :  Since he started competing in Parasports, Deepti had been winning medals left right in centre.
*25:43.620- 25:47.940* :  Earlier this year, she won gold at the World Power Athletic Championship,
*25:48.660- 25:51.960* :  broke the World Record and qualified for the Paralympics.
*25:52.800- 25:55.960* :  India is a country with the world's biggest population.
*25:56.500- 26:03.120* :  So why is it only now sending its first athlete with AI and intellectual impairment to the Paralympics?
*26:03.640- 26:06.060* :  Many parents are not aware of the opportunities.
*26:06.600- 26:13.540* :  That's one and many of them are not aware that their son or daughter has this condition.
*26:14.500- 26:20.420* :  Evan Benjamin in Cyrus India, the country's organisation for intellectual impairments,
*26:20.500- 26:20.860* :  sports.
*26:21.400- 26:27.280* :  We are working on creating awareness on what our athletes with AI can achieve.
*26:28.280- 26:33.200* :  Even the coaches have not been able to identify the potential or the ability
*26:33.660- 26:40.080* :  so therefore what happens is they are not pushing their athletes to achieve beyond a certain level.
*26:41.000- 26:45.660* :  Awareness and understanding of intellectual impairment as well as lack of resources
*26:46.580- 26:48.400* :  are big factors across the world.
*26:48.980- 26:53.780* :  Another barrier for athletes with intellectual impairment is the sports that are available to them
*26:54.000- 26:54.940* :  at the Paralympics.
*26:55.460- 26:59.660* :  At the moment it's just three athletics swimming and table tennis.
*27:00.280- 27:04.800* :  Robin Smith is a member of the International Parliament Committee, Governing Board.
*27:05.340- 27:11.860* :  We've had some really positive discussions about not only more events within athletic swimming
*27:11.860- 27:16.520* :  and table tennis but also potential of some new sporting opportunities.
*27:17.080- 27:20.020* :  There's a lot of positive work going on and I'm optimistic.
*27:20.980- 27:26.120* :  Dan Pepper reporting and you can hear his documentary called The Next Paralympians
*27:26.500- 27:31.780* :  on the documentary podcast from the BBC World Service, wherever you get your podcasts.
*27:32.980- 27:39.260* :  Scientists here in the UK have taught a glob of jelly to play a simple 1970s computer game
*27:39.260- 27:40.260* :  called Pong.
*27:40.780- 27:44.640* :  Researchers at the University of Reading passed the electric current through the jail
*27:44.960- 27:47.200* :  and managed to create a basic kind of memory.
*27:47.200- 27:51.580* :  They say it will lead to cheaper ways of creating artificial intelligence.
*27:52.300- 27:56.280* :  Richard Hamilton's report starts with signs which some listeners might find familiar.
*28:04.460- 28:11.400* :  Pong was one of the early video games released in 1972 by the American company Atari.
*28:12.240- 28:18.980* :  Simulating table tennis or ping pong, a vertical oblong moves up and down the screen to hit a ball.
*28:21.320- 28:27.040* :  Inspired by their previous research that used brain cells in a dish to play Pong,
*28:27.600- 28:33.600* :  Dr Vincent Strong and his colleagues decided to try playing the game with an even simpler material.
*28:34.340- 28:41.100* :  They took a jail containing water and laced it with ions to make it responsive to electrical
*28:41.100- 28:48.000* :  stimuli. They used a standard computer to run a game of Pong and passed an electric current
*28:48.420- 28:51.920* :  into different points on the jail to represent the ball moving.
*28:52.900- 28:58.220* :  When electricity passed through this material, the ions moved the source of the current,
*28:58.220- 29:02.180* :  dragging water with them and causing the jail to swell.
*29:03.080- 29:08.280* :  The team found that the jelly could not only play the game but also got better with practice
*29:08.960- 29:10.820* :  and the length of the rallies increased.
*29:11.180- 29:16.740* :  Vincent Strong says the swelling of the jail creates a rudimentary sort of memory
*29:16.740- 29:20.780* :  as signs of the swelling remain recorded in the material.
*29:20.780- 29:26.400* :  How the ions move in relation to this stimulation creates a sort of map to memory
*29:26.400- 29:29.160* :  of the ball's motion throughout the course of the game.
*29:29.740- 29:31.460* :  You can think of a muscle memory essentially.
*29:32.000- 29:35.260* :  As you would move your hand to grab a ball out of the air,
*29:35.260- 29:39.980* :  you do it multiple times and you get better because your muscles have a memory to them
*29:40.380- 29:41.500* :  and the connection between the two.
*29:42.220- 29:45.420* :  And when you say that it got better at playing Pong,
*29:45.580- 29:49.120* :  do you think you could beat it if it was on the other side of the court?
*29:49.780- 29:53.060* :  I think I played on a video games. I like the thing I could beat it.
*29:53.740- 29:56.200* :  I'd say it wasn't like extremely good.
*29:56.740- 29:59.740* :  But then again, as opposed Pong is a difficult game.
*30:00.160- 30:05.180* :  The team plans to conduct further experiments like this to explore whether the jelly
*30:05.180- 30:07.540* :  can handle more complex tasks.
*30:08.300- 30:14.740* :  They believe their research shows that even very simple materials can exhibit complex
*30:14.740- 30:21.820* :  adaptive behaviors typically associated with our living brain systems or sophisticated AI.
*30:22.700- 30:26.480* :  And finally, Dr Strong says that as a lover of science fiction,
*30:26.480- 30:33.280* :  he can imagine that one day in the future robots could be built with this gel inside their brains.
*30:34.600- 30:40.220* :  Richard Hamilton, and from a soft jelly-like substance to one of the world's hardest materials.
*30:40.900- 30:44.960* :  On Friday, the President of Botswana experienced holding a huge gem,
*30:45.340- 30:50.640* :  a day after a Canadian company announced it had discovered the world's second largest diamond
*30:50.640- 30:54.060* :  at the Kurovi mine in the northeast of Botswana.
*30:54.240- 31:00.180* :  It was so big that President Mugwitsi Masisi had to use both hands to hold it.
*31:00.780- 31:02.280* :  And here is his reaction.
*31:03.380- 31:06.800* :  Oh, do you have to have both hands?
*31:15.660- 31:18.240* :  So this is the 2,492 karats there.
*31:19.080- 31:19.640* :  Quite is good.
*31:21.480- 31:24.780* :  And you can see that very moment on the BBC website.
*31:26.820- 31:30.540* :  And that's it from us for now, but we'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*31:42.760- 31:46.480* :  This edition was mixed by Rob Fanner, the producer was Isabella Jewel,
*31:46.620- 31:49.100* :  the editor as ever is Karen Martin.
*31:49.580- 31:51.620* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and till next time, bye bye.
*32:00.380- 32:01.760* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right?
*32:02.680- 32:08.940* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time when he was the biggest star in
*32:08.940- 32:15.380* :  all the world. But something happened, not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
*32:16.040- 32:18.860* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.
*32:19.900- 32:25.380* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
