*01:31.740- 01:38.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Gilliland at 13 hours GMT
*01:38.640- 01:44.120* :  on Wednesday 21st August, these are our main stories. Barack and Michelle Obama have given
*01:44.120- 01:49.760* :  impassioned endorsements of Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention. We hear why
*01:49.760- 01:55.260* :  thousands of Ukrainian refugees in Hungary could become homeless or be forced to return to Ukraine.
*01:56.320- 02:02.300* :  New research suggests processed meat like ham could raise the risk of type 2 diabetes.
*02:05.880- 02:12.820* :  Also in this podcast, benefit no more. It's not a surprise. I mean, Ben has already bought a
*02:12.820- 02:18.540* :  20 million dollar home and he's living there separately from her. Jennifer Lopez files for divorce
*02:18.540- 02:29.200* :  from Ben Affleck. We start in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention where two of the
*02:29.200- 02:34.560* :  Democratic parties, most popular figures, the former president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle,
*02:34.560- 02:40.340* :  have used their star power to throw their backing behind Kamala Harris, saying that she inspired
*02:40.340- 02:46.800* :  the same sense of hope and excitement that led to Mr Obama becoming America's first black president.
*02:47.580- 02:51.780* :  In back-to-back speeches that electrified the audience in the Pact Arena in Chicago,
*02:51.780- 02:58.500* :  they tore into Donald Trump, describing him as weird and stale and mocking his obsession with
*02:58.500- 03:05.720* :  crowd sizes and his use of the term black jobs. Our correspondent Emma Vady sent this report from there.
*03:07.780- 03:17.440* :  Chicago, oh you ready. There was a DJ on the decks, a rapper on the mic and a potty atmosphere
*03:17.440- 03:26.200* :  in the arena. People danced as state by state, delegates cast their votes, choosing Kamala Harris as
*03:26.200- 03:34.020* :  the Democrat's presidential nominee. But this was only symbolic. The official process had happened
*03:34.020- 03:39.220* :  two weeks earlier to meet ballot deadlines, but states delivered their endorsements with enthusiasm.
*03:39.800- 03:47.420* :  Illinois cast 176 votes for the next president of the United States.
*03:48.160- 03:53.140* :  The delegates at the Democratic National Convention, well they just completed their
*03:53.140- 03:58.640* :  roll call. Kamala Harris joined live over video from her rally in the swing state of Wisconsin.
*03:59.040- 04:05.400* :  And they have nominated coach walls in me to be the next vice president and president
*04:05.400- 04:12.920* :  of the United States of America. We are ready for a president Kamala Harris.
*04:13.720- 04:18.680* :  There was always going to be huge, important place on the words of former president Barack Obama.
*04:19.440- 04:25.980* :  And first he paid tribute to Joe Biden. History will remember Joe Biden as an outstanding
*04:25.980- 04:30.860* :  president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger.
*04:31.060- 04:36.720* :  And he delivered a scathing characterization of Donald Trump, who trained him as a man of the past.
*04:36.720- 04:42.620* :  It is one of the oldest tricks and politics. From a guy who has, let's face it, gotten pretty
*04:42.620- 04:51.880* :  stable. We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie
*04:51.880- 04:56.340* :  before and we all know that the sequel is usually worse.
*05:00.560- 05:06.200* :  And one of the most popular figures in US politics, Michelle Obama, received a standing ovation.
*05:06.560- 05:11.920* :  Hope is making a comeback. The former first lady, who famously said she doesn't like politics,
*05:11.920- 05:19.100* :  had this political crowd electrified. And she went after Donald Trump for his recent comment,
*05:19.100- 05:24.480* :  which backfired over black jobs. See his, his limited narrow view of the world,
*05:25.220- 05:30.520* :  made him feel threatened by the existence of too hard work and highly educated successful people
*05:30.520- 05:39.560* :  who happen to be black. I want to know. I want to know, who's going to tell him,
*05:40.100- 05:44.540* :  who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs.
*05:44.540- 05:51.640* :  It was a personal touch as Kamala Harris's family took to the stage. Her husband, Doug,
*05:51.640- 05:57.740* :  revealing that she delights in replaying his awkward first date voicemail back to him every
*05:57.740- 06:05.320* :  anniversary. I got Kamala's voicemail and I just started rambling. Hey, it's Doug.
*06:07.680- 06:13.820* :  From the sea to the river. Outside pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with police.
*06:15.880- 06:19.440* :  In a second night of large demonstrations, which are set to continue.
*06:22.680- 06:27.260* :  But in this arena, tonight will be remembered as the moment that the Obama's lent their
*06:27.260- 06:33.720* :  star appeal, born out of victory's past, to Kamala Harris in a bid to persuade voters to choose
*06:33.720- 06:44.700* :  her as the future. That report by Emma Vardi in Chicago. Well, my colleague Justin Webb is also
*06:44.700- 06:51.640* :  in Chicago and he gave this analysis of Barack Obama's convention speech. His sole job really was
*06:51.640- 06:59.700* :  to set a course for this entire convention towards that famous phrase that he made famous
*06:59.700- 07:06.240* :  when he was running and he used it right at the beginning of his speech and the phrases.
*07:06.660- 07:10.760* :  I don't know about you. I'm feeling fired up and ready to go.
*07:12.700- 07:19.620* :  Is this good to be home? I don't know about you, but I'm feeling fired up.
*07:20.980- 07:26.720* :  And he used to say that. I heard him say it again and again in the 2008 campaign and it worked
*07:26.720- 07:33.260* :  brilliantly because although it's vague, it persuaded people that something was stirring and it
*07:33.260- 07:39.960* :  was something positive that was stirring. That is what Obama's job was today. He and Michelle,
*07:39.960- 07:46.160* :  and that's what unquestionably, at least inside this hall, he has achieved. So not a list of
*07:46.160- 07:52.540* :  policies, nothing like that, but this sense that there is something afoot and it's something
*07:52.540- 07:57.360* :  positive and it's something that can lead to victory in November. Is there always a sort of
*07:57.360- 08:03.660* :  positive reaction in after the Huha and the Jamboree of a convention? Well, yeah, I mean,
*08:03.660- 08:08.040* :  there always has been in the past, you look for a bounce, a polling bounce, it's a bit different
*08:08.040- 08:12.740* :  this year because so many peculiar things, unprecedented things have happened really or certainly
*08:12.740- 08:17.660* :  the fact of them all happening together is unprecedented. This has been the oddest summer in
*08:17.660- 08:21.720* :  American politics, certainly in modern times. So who knows whether there'll be a polling bounce,
*08:21.880- 08:28.640* :  but the really gruelling work starts once September comes, and specifically I suppose once this
*08:28.640- 08:33.760* :  debate happens between her and Donald Trump on September the 10th, until then I think it's
*08:33.760- 08:40.960* :  impossible to say really that anything important in opinion terms comes from this convention.
*08:41.040- 08:46.820* :  It's more the setting of the stage for the kind of campaign that the Democrats want to fight
*08:47.180- 08:50.840* :  and think can be successful. That's the importance of this week.
*08:51.860- 08:57.740* :  Justin Webb speaking to Simon Jack. A new law has come into force in Hungary which means only
*08:57.740- 09:03.940* :  Ukrainian refugees from areas directly affected by fighting will be supported by the Hungarian state.
*09:04.580- 09:09.320* :  It's believed around 31,000 Ukrainians are in Hungary because of Russia's invasion.
*09:10.240- 09:15.040* :  Hungary currently holds the EU's rotating presidency and not long after assuming it,
*09:15.040- 09:20.900* :  the Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, angered many in the EU by going to Moscow for what he dubbed
*09:20.900- 09:27.000* :  peace talk to try to end the war in Ukraine days after he'd visited Kiev. I got more on this
*09:27.000- 09:32.560* :  with our reporter in Budapest, Nick Thorpe, but first I asked him what this new law means for
*09:32.560- 09:38.960* :  Ukrainian refugees in Hungary. The UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency has calculated it could affect
*09:39.380- 09:46.440* :  two to 3,000 people of the 31,000 or so that are believed to be in the country from Ukraine at the
*09:46.440- 09:52.280* :  moment. What it means for them, it's pretty serious because most of those people have come from
*09:52.280- 09:59.060* :  areas of Ukraine, obviously the whole country is affected by war, but only 13 are regions or blasts
*09:59.060- 10:05.220* :  of Ukraine listed in the law where people can continue to receive state support. So in a nutshell,
*10:05.220- 10:09.680* :  it means that several thousand people who've been getting state support that's for shelter,
*10:09.680- 10:17.300* :  food and so on will no longer be able to receive that. And this comes just weeks after Viktor Orban
*10:17.300- 10:23.200* :  controversially visited Ukraine and Russia, costing himself as a peacemaker.
*10:24.800- 10:30.620* :  That's right, Mr Orban's policies towards Ukraine have really stood out as rather different from
*10:30.620- 10:37.140* :  the rest of the EU. He's been very keen to stress the amount of humanitarian aid Hungary gives
*10:37.140- 10:44.060* :  to Ukraine, especially to Western Ukraine, where there's a sizable Hungarian minority, but at the
*10:44.060- 10:50.060* :  same time, his policies have been very much against supplying weapons of any kind or allowing
*10:50.060- 10:55.640* :  the transit of weapons to Ukraine across Hungarian territory. Of course, that's not so important to
*10:55.640- 11:00.360* :  Ukraine because they can get weapons through other directions, but it's really put hungry at
*11:00.360- 11:06.540* :  odds. And so it seems almost everything Mr Orban does is pretty controversial when it comes to
*11:06.540- 11:12.760* :  Ukraine. Yes, and that includes easing the entry requirements for Russians and Beller Russians,
*11:12.860- 11:18.060* :  and this is really increasing tensions with the EU at a time when Hungary holds a rotating
*11:18.060- 11:23.760* :  presidency. Yes, exactly. This happened in the beginning of July, so pretty much every month,
*11:23.760- 11:29.420* :  something happens, which increases these tensions between the Hungarian government and the EU
*11:29.420- 11:35.660* :  presidency. Basically, they had a list of countries which could apply for a national card, they could
*11:35.660- 11:41.580* :  come to work easily in Hungary, a sort of fast-track procedure, and Russians and Beller Russians
*11:41.580- 11:47.400* :  were added to that in a new decree which came into force in July. Nick Thorpe in Hungary.
*11:48.940- 11:53.820* :  Meanwhile, in Ukraine itself, the fighting grinds on in the east, around the strategically
*11:53.820- 12:00.400* :  important city of Pokrozk, civilians continue to be evacuated as Russian troops advance.
*12:01.120- 12:06.840* :  Zeredovo is one of the affected towns near Pokrozk. The BBC receives this voice note from a man
*12:06.840- 12:12.480* :  who was evacuated with his family from that city in eastern Ukraine. He asks that we keep his identity
*12:12.480- 12:24.000* :  hidden for security reasons. I dealt with the logistics. People are really leaving the
*12:24.000- 12:30.180* :  Donetsk region, a large number of cars. More and more often, as in the first days of the invasion,
*12:30.180- 12:36.460* :  people take everything they can, load trailers, and you just see these stuffed cars with Donetsk
*12:36.460- 12:43.120* :  license plates. But in Zeredovo city itself, I walked today, talked with local people. They say
*12:43.120- 12:48.400* :  that many people stayed until the end, but often there are people who were there just yesterday,
*12:48.920- 12:54.440* :  and say they will not go anywhere, and then they go. Many people are leaving, and many are still
*12:54.440- 13:01.760* :  staying. But the pace is increasing. Today, for example, the last ATM was dismantled in Zeredovo,
*13:02.000- 13:06.880* :  and people came and said that we can no longer withdraw money here. That for that, we need to go
*13:06.880- 13:12.200* :  to Pokrozk. I asked the neighbours of my grandparents. They said that they did not have such an
*13:12.200- 13:17.080* :  opportunity, and that there was nowhere to go. If they at least had the opportunity to leave,
*13:17.080- 13:23.040* :  like I did, they would have left without hesitation. It's also difficult for me. We were speaking
*13:23.040- 13:28.860* :  with my grandparents about it for a long time yesterday, but they were determined not to leave.
*13:29.140- 13:33.040* :  But during all this time, there has been heavy shelling. Everything is flying everywhere,
*13:33.420- 13:38.900* :  including grads, artillery. When I was staying there, things were flying in the sky at night.
*13:38.900- 13:45.460* :  I woke up several times during the night from very close and loud explosions. It's not just guided
*13:45.460- 13:51.700* :  aerial bombs. It's most likely artillery, meaning the Russians can reach the city with short range
*13:51.700- 13:57.160* :  artillery. While there are fewer and fewer people, people are in panic. There is a big problem with
*13:57.160- 14:03.200* :  housing, because in the nearby Dinipropet Trovsk region, prices have skyrocketed, and there is
*14:03.200- 14:08.420* :  another wave of people fleeing, which is very noticeable. It is even visually visible.
*14:09.620- 14:15.500* :  The words of a Ukrainian man who has evacuated with his family from Selidovo in eastern Ukraine.
*14:17.140- 14:22.820* :  Now, do you like a ham sandwich or a sausage roll? Well, if you do, I'm afraid there's some bad news
*14:22.940- 14:28.320* :  for you. A new worldwide study of more than 2 million people suggests a link between eating
*14:28.320- 14:33.860* :  processed meat and type 2 diabetes. That's according to scientists at Cambridge University who found
*14:33.860- 14:40.080* :  that eating just 50 grams of ham or sausages a day makes people 15% more likely to develop
*14:40.080- 14:46.800* :  the disease within 10 years. Type 2 diabetes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and
*14:46.800- 14:53.540* :  can cause blindness, heart disease, strokes and lower limb amputation. Our health editor,
*14:53.540- 14:57.520* :  Michelle Roberts, told us more about the link this research has found.
*14:58.900- 15:04.200* :  I think the key words you've just said then is link. Now, this can't prove that the diet is
*15:04.200- 15:10.300* :  causing diabetes. We just don't know. There's been a suggestion for a while that processed meat
*15:10.300- 15:17.360* :  in particular, by process, I mean things that have salt added or other manufacturing things to
*15:17.360- 15:23.580* :  extend the shelf life of it or change the taste. So we're talking about it sort of salami, that kind
*15:23.580- 15:30.960* :  of thing that that might have health risks. If you eat a lot of it, now what's a lot? In this
*15:30.960- 15:36.900* :  study, they're saying that if you're having it daily over the recommended amount, which, you know,
*15:37.060- 15:43.740* :  we know that lots of healthy eating advice is saying, mix in with vegetables, don't eat meat
*15:43.740- 15:49.420* :  necessarily every day. So what the researchers were looking at was the more extreme end,
*15:49.760- 15:54.200* :  and they are saying, as well as other experts that I've spoken to, that this isn't the final word.
*15:54.560- 15:59.320* :  So we do know that processed meat, eating a lot of it, is quite strongly linked with
*15:59.320- 16:03.600* :  bowel cancer, but with diabetes, the question marks still there. Well, this is it because I think
*16:03.600- 16:06.780* :  a lot of people know about the links with bowel cancer, but they'll be surprised
*16:06.780- 16:10.880* :  that it's been linked to diabetes because when you think of that, you tend to think of things
*16:10.880- 16:17.600* :  like sugar and carbs. You do, but it's all about what's the ingredient, so it might be something to
*16:17.600- 16:22.980* :  do with the processing according to these researchers, but also all foods can have an impact on your
*16:22.980- 16:28.980* :  blood sugar levels. But with diabetes, there are lots of known strong risk factors, so things like
*16:28.980- 16:35.360* :  family history, and also your body weight. If you're overweight or obese, that's a real big
*16:35.360- 16:42.540* :  risk factor for type 2 diabetes. So it's difficult to tease all of these apart, and that's what is
*16:42.540- 16:47.320* :  difficult about this research. It's a good piece of research, but it's really hard when you're
*16:47.320- 16:50.560* :  asking people to recall what they've eaten. Michelle Roberts.
*16:53.600- 16:57.880* :  Still to come. One of their women was just saying to me, it's so important not just for the women
*16:57.880- 17:01.980* :  who've been able to come to Scotland, but for all the girls of Afghanistan who know that it's
*17:02.220- 17:07.520* :  possible, very, very difficult, but possible for them to fulfill their dreams and aspirations.
*17:08.400- 17:12.260* :  We hear why a group of Afghan women is being welcomed in Scotland.
*17:20.700- 17:24.740* :  This summer, Instacard presents famous summer flavors coming to your front door,

*18:25.840- 18:30.000* :  The Australian government has given the green light to the first stages of what it describes
*18:30.000- 18:36.220* :  as a country's biggest renewable energy project ever. The plan is to create an enormous solar farm
*18:36.220- 18:40.200* :  in the Northern Territory Outback, which its hoped will power three million homes,
*18:40.200- 18:46.200* :  as well as send energy to Singapore via undersea cables. Our correspondent in Sydney,
*18:46.200- 18:53.420* :  Phil Mercer, told us more about the ambitious project. This is the Sun cable project. It will
*18:53.420- 19:00.940* :  be according to the government Australia's biggest solar farm. It will be enormous about 12,000
*19:00.940- 19:07.660* :  hectares in size and built on a former grazing property near the very small town of Elliott
*19:08.280- 19:14.420* :  in the Northern Territory, with a population of just under 400 people. So enormous changes are
*19:14.420- 19:20.400* :  coming to that part of the red dust of the Outback. The government here in Australia says it has
*19:20.400- 19:27.160* :  the potential to power three million homes, and many of those could be in another country. Now,
*19:27.160- 19:34.120* :  this solar and battery farm would also include an 800-kilometer transmission line to the tropical
*19:34.120- 19:40.700* :  Australian city of Darwin, and eventually that undersea cable you mentioned could eventually
*19:40.700- 19:47.160* :  export electricity to Singapore, and that's a distance from Darwin to Singapore, including
*19:47.160- 19:55.420* :  the extra distance to the solar farm, would be well over 3,000 kilometers. So, Phil, what about
*19:55.420- 19:59.840* :  the environment in the Outback? Are there concerns about that? Well, there are strict environmental
*20:01.580- 20:06.380* :  concerns or strict environmental conditions, I should say, attached to this approval by the
*20:06.380- 20:12.680* :  Federal Environment Minister Tanya Plybosak. There have been concerns that this development could
*20:12.780- 20:19.800* :  change the water flows into one of the Northern Territory's largest inland freshwater lakes,
*20:19.880- 20:27.140* :  and also impact threatened species such as the Greater Bilby, which is a very well-known marsupial
*20:27.140- 20:33.400* :  in this country, and also other threatened birds and lizards. But the Federal Government in Australia
*20:33.400- 20:41.140* :  says that these strict environmental measures will ensure that the environmental damage
*20:41.140- 20:48.140* :  of this project will be kept to a minimum. Phil Mercer. The Italian Coast Guard says it's
*20:48.140- 20:53.100* :  deployed an underwater robot to help search for the six people who are missing after a super yacht
*20:53.100- 20:58.080* :  sank off the coast of Sicily on Monday. The luxury sailing ship, which is lying on its side,
*20:58.080- 21:03.760* :  50 meters down sank in minutes after a sudden tornado-like weather event. Among the missing
*21:03.760- 21:09.660* :  is the British Technology Entrepreneur Mike Lynch. The body of a man recovered near the yacht
*21:09.660- 21:14.640* :  is believed to be that of Ricardo Thomas, a Canadian antique and chef who was working on the boat.
*21:15.320- 21:19.620* :  His friends have been paying tribute. Gareth Williams, who lives in Antigua,
*21:19.960- 21:24.600* :  knew Thomas for 30 years. He's just one of these people that's just in your life.
*21:25.640- 21:31.720* :  Always been in your life. Always been cool. He was always there. He was ready to help you,
*21:32.420- 21:38.820* :  ready to defend you, and ready to make your laugh. And he just loved his life. And he was getting
*21:38.820- 21:45.700* :  close to retiring. You know, I fight saying this, but you know, like he did tell me not too long ago,
*21:45.700- 21:52.680* :  like one more, maybe two more seasons than he's done. And I'll put my money down. And a lot of
*21:52.680- 21:57.220* :  our friends say that he stayed on that boat because there were people on that boat. And he would have
*21:57.220- 22:02.020* :  stayed there on that boat as long as possible to get other people off. He would not leave that boat
*22:02.420- 22:08.460* :  without helping whether it's his crew or if it's the guests. There were kids on the boat. I know,
*22:08.460- 22:15.820* :  I know there's no way. And that's how I see it. And a lot of us see it like that. And you'll want
*22:15.820- 22:21.800* :  think that your friend is a hero, right? But that's the human he was, man. You have to put his
*22:21.800- 22:27.480* :  life on the line for people he would have. Gareth Williams, they're talking about his friend,
*22:27.500- 22:33.580* :  Ricardo Domas. In the three years since the Taliban, we took control of Afghanistan. Human rights
*22:33.580- 22:40.380* :  groups say gender apartheid has hit Afghanistan's 14 million women and girls, excluding them from
*22:40.380- 22:47.360* :  almost every aspect of public life, including education. But now a charity has brought 19 Afghan
*22:47.360- 22:51.940* :  women to the UK so that they can finish their medical degrees. Ella Bignore reports.
*22:57.720- 23:03.440* :  And shakes, hugs, tears and smiles as 19 medical students walk through the arrivals gate
*23:03.440- 23:09.480* :  at Edinburgh airport. Since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan, the students' dreams
*23:09.480- 23:15.080* :  of becoming doctors have been on hold. But no longer, thanks to a charity set up in memory of
*23:15.080- 23:21.080* :  a Scottish aid worker. Lyndon Orgrove was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2010 and died during an
*23:21.080- 23:26.540* :  attempt to rescue her. Her parents set up a foundation in her name to support projects helping Afghan
*23:26.540- 23:31.940* :  women and girls. The charity has raised tens of thousands of dollars to get the women to the UK.
*23:32.720- 23:39.040* :  This process has taken two years, negotiating living support, free tuition, changes to visa rules,
*23:39.040- 23:44.520* :  even a last-minute intervention by British consular staff in Pakistan, making sure the group were
*23:44.520- 23:48.300* :  allowed to board their plane. A Scotland office minister in the British government,
*23:48.300- 23:53.800* :  Kirsty McNeill says it will all be worth it. One of the women was just saying to me it's so
*23:53.800- 23:57.360* :  important not just for the women who've been able to come to Scotland, but for all the girls
*23:57.460- 24:03.140* :  of Afghanistan who know that it's possible, very, very difficult but possible for them to fulfill
*24:03.140- 24:08.500* :  their dreams and aspirations. Of course, Scotland has a really long tradition in medical signs,
*24:08.500- 24:13.300* :  in particular, and in educating women the fact that they could be here in Scotland means such a
*24:13.300- 24:20.480* :  huge amount. I know they'll have a fantastic welcome. For these 19 young women, their education
*24:20.480- 24:25.140* :  continues, but for more than a million girls and women who remain in Afghanistan,
*24:25.140- 24:31.500* :  there's no access to formal education. In fact, it remains the only country that bans school for
*24:31.500- 24:39.360* :  girls beyond primary school age. Ella Bignol. BYD is among the Chinese electric vehicle makers
*24:39.360- 24:44.540* :  facing fresh tariffs on imports to the European Union, tariffs which are designed to try to
*24:44.540- 24:51.780* :  protect domestic car makers. Turkey is not in the EU, but it is in the customs union. So what could
*24:51.780- 24:58.060* :  these tariffs mean for BYD's plans to build a factory in Turkey in a deal potentially worth
*24:58.060- 25:01.780* :  a billion dollars? Victoria Craig has this report.
*25:05.720- 25:10.600* :  Manisa is a city on Turkey's West Coast, just an hour or so away from key transportation
*25:10.600- 25:16.820* :  links to Europe. Major automobile makers like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai have factories in the region,
*25:16.820- 25:23.140* :  and they'll soon be joined by the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. Turkey is not in the European
*25:23.260- 25:29.140* :  Union, but it is in the customs union, so it can trade goods freely with EU countries, meaning
*25:29.140- 25:35.340* :  that BYD can have weighed a new nearly 40 percent import tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles
*25:35.340- 25:41.740* :  by setting up shop in Turkey. It's a stiflingly hot afternoon in Manisa, but factory workers are
*25:41.740- 25:48.360* :  buzzing over hot cups of Turkish tea about news of the $1 billion BYD investment in their city.
*25:53.600- 25:58.140* :  A young man named Yasin tells me when multinational companies like Mitsubishi come in,
*25:58.140- 26:01.540* :  new housing, transportation and schools often follow.
*26:08.260- 26:13.300* :  His friend Faraday says because of the current economic crisis, which features inflation of just
*26:13.300- 26:20.080* :  about 72 percent. People will be desperate to work at the BYD factory. The company says 5,000
*26:20.080- 26:25.220* :  jobs will be on offer, but Faraday estimates it could get as many as 10,000 applicants.
*26:26.880- 26:32.260* :  Workers won't have to wait too long to find out, as Manisa's mayor, Faraday Zerak, explains.
*26:36.060- 26:43.020* :  The owner of BYD said, I want to see my first car on the roads in Manisa in 13 months. To help
*26:43.020- 26:48.380* :  reach that goal, we will provide all the support we can in the zoning regulation and infrastructure
*26:49.700- 26:51.980* :  and the construction will start as soon as possible.
*26:56.700- 27:02.880* :  An aggressive timeline, yes, but he said BYD will bring its own workers from China to help speed
*27:02.880- 27:07.620* :  up the process, as for what that means for the long term mix of employment opportunities.
*27:12.480- 27:17.780* :  Turkish people will also work here. Engineers from China will also probably come and work here.
*27:18.240- 27:22.820* :  Now this is the question. I don't know how the distribution of 5,000 people will be,
*27:23.140- 27:27.840* :  or what the business structures will be, but a system will be formed here with the integration
*27:27.840- 27:31.720* :  of people coming from China and engineers or workers in Manisa.
*27:32.340- 27:36.880* :  Asla Aiden Tashbash is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington,
*27:36.880- 27:42.840* :  and she says the European Union is unlikely to take action against Turkey for encouraging BYD
*27:42.840- 27:47.560* :  to open a manufacturing facility in Manisa, thus avoid paying import tariffs.
*27:47.580- 27:55.000* :  I think it would be too escalatory for Europe to reduce its exposure to Turkey.
*27:55.000- 28:00.300* :  It's a huge market for Europe, but also a huge manufacturing base for some European companies.
*28:00.300- 28:04.640* :  So I think there would be a pause when it comes to penalizing Turkey.
*28:05.900- 28:09.700* :  Back in Manisa, Yasin and Ferdy, the friends we met at the local T-house say,
*28:09.700- 28:13.900* :  regardless of what motivated BYD to bring the investment to their city,
*28:13.900- 28:19.000* :  the benefits for their community will be huge, maybe even enough to tempt them
*28:19.000- 28:23.640* :  to leave their own factory jobs down the road. Victoria Craig reporting.
*28:24.500- 28:26.860* :  Now it's been described as benefit.
*28:29.000- 28:30.700* :  I've been married four times now.
*28:32.520- 28:36.540* :  I used to be terrified to be alone. I didn't know what it was until I messed up.
*28:37.340- 28:42.860* :  I am decided to tell my story, and I've never shared with anybody in the world.
*28:44.860- 28:48.540* :  The trailer for the greatest love story never told.
*28:48.540- 28:53.980* :  Jennifer Lopez's documentary about her life, her marriage to Ben Affleck and the making of her
*28:53.980- 28:59.320* :  album, This Is Me Now. But now after a relationship that spanned two decades,
*28:59.320- 29:05.200* :  involved a big split because of intrusive media attention, two engagements, two weddings,
*29:05.200- 29:09.600* :  and too many headlines to count, benefit is about to end.
*29:10.120- 29:14.160* :  US media say Jennifer Lopez or JLo, as she's known to her many fans,
*29:14.160- 29:17.400* :  filed the divorce papers personally in Los Angeles.
*29:18.080- 29:20.600* :  Jeannie Wolfe is an entertainment journalist in Hollywood.
*29:21.640- 29:26.780* :  It's not a surprise. Ben has already bought a $20 million home and he's
*29:26.780- 29:32.560* :  living there separately from her. When he didn't come to the Met Ball, the big New York fashion
*29:32.560- 29:42.720* :  ball, that started the talk. Then a couple of weeks later, Ben was seen with what the tabloids
*29:42.720- 29:55.100* :  are calling a do-over or a future change in life haircut. Partly Mohawk is hair shaved on the
*29:55.100- 30:00.820* :  sides and him riding a motorcycle and that certainly created enough conversation.
*30:01.460- 30:06.200* :  I think what caused the end of the relationship is something he talked about in the loving
*30:06.200- 30:12.300* :  documentary she made about falling in love with him and that is he said, I don't want a life
*30:12.920- 30:19.640* :  on social media and what he really meant is he wanted a quieter, let's say, more normal life
*30:19.640- 30:26.020* :  where everything they did wasn't in public and he got serious about it and for Jennifer,
*30:26.020- 30:33.100* :  it's just part of her nature. It's part of being a pop star, it's part of being a singing star
*30:33.760- 30:40.600* :  and you know that she wanted everything grand and splashy and in public and he certainly went
*30:40.600- 30:45.820* :  along with it for a while. That seems to be the reason and he was pretty frank about that
*30:46.220- 30:52.040* :  and I think they both will be when things calm down because there's a tremendous attraction
*30:53.020- 30:59.520* :  but they just couldn't figure out a way to live together. She is very romantic and yet her romance,
*30:59.520- 31:05.460* :  she doesn't, he felt that she wouldn't be private about it in the documentary, he talks about
*31:05.460- 31:11.520* :  sending her a book that he made with the love letters and the emails they sent back and forth
*31:12.100- 31:17.360* :  and she shared that with the people she made the documentary with and he said that really troubled
*31:17.500- 31:23.160* :  him because he felt that certain things are just too private to share and she felt
*31:23.160- 31:29.300* :  she was so excited about their relationship that she wanted to share it with the world.
*31:30.360- 31:32.200* :  Entertainment journalist Ginny Wolf
*31:34.920- 31:39.160* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*31:56.720- 31:58.000* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*32:06.680- 32:11.500* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather
*32:11.500- 32:16.040* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world.
*32:16.820- 32:21.760* :  But something happened, not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
*32:22.440- 32:25.240* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.
*32:26.280- 32:31.760* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
