*00:45.640- 00:50.820* :  legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:51.240- 00:53.840* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:53.840- 00:58.640* :  honorists to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you talking about? You insane Hollywood

*01:21.440- 01:26.740* :  I'm Janet Gilliland at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 22nd of August. These are our main stories.
*01:27.540- 01:32.420* :  The Indonesian government appears to have dropped plans to pass a controversial election law
*01:32.460- 01:36.980* :  which critics said was designed to strengthen President Joko Widodo's influence.
*01:37.980- 01:42.980* :  The US Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee Tim Walls introduces himself to Americans
*01:42.980- 01:49.540* :  as he goes on the attack against Republicans. The new boss of Starbucks is facing criticism
*01:49.960- 01:54.700* :  after it was revealed that he's been offered a corporate jet to commute to work.
*01:58.120- 02:03.720* :  Also in this podcast, the second biggest diamond ever found is unearthed in Boswana.
*02:08.860- 02:13.680* :  The Indonesian Parliament has shelved controversial plans to change the election laws
*02:14.100- 02:19.600* :  after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in cities across the country to protest.
*02:27.260- 02:32.060* :  The demonstrators were angered by what they saw as an attempt to strengthen the influence of
*02:32.060- 02:38.440* :  the outgoing President Joko Widodo who's due to leave office in October. Such was the strength
*02:38.440- 02:43.900* :  of feeling that some protesters tried to tear down the gates of Parliament in the capital Jakarta
*02:44.380- 02:49.060* :  only for police to use water cannon on them. Shortly before we recorded this podcast,
*02:49.060- 02:55.360* :  our correspondent Nick Marsh told us it appeared that the protesters had succeeded in making Parliament
*02:55.360- 03:01.720* :  back down. It does seem like this very controversial law change has been dropped by the Parliament
*03:01.720- 03:07.120* :  at least until the end of this parliamentary session. There's no prospect of this legislation
*03:07.120- 03:15.100* :  resurfacing until after the current President Joko Widodo steps down in October. Quite an
*03:15.100- 03:19.580* :  interesting development, that's on pause basically. In terms of the actual protests,
*03:20.840- 03:25.280* :  at least a thousand in Jakarta hundreds in other cities across Java, which is Indonesia's
*03:25.860- 03:30.200* :  main most popular island, there were some people trying to tear down the gates of the Parliament
*03:30.200- 03:37.300* :  complex in Jakarta that we saw images of tear gas, of water cannon and so on, and small skirmishes
*03:37.300- 03:43.780* :  like you say between the security forces and the demonstrators. Let's see if that continues now
*03:43.780- 03:48.400* :  if things are starting to obey and whether we'll see the same tomorrow, presumably not because
*03:48.400- 03:52.420* :  this legislation, like I said, has just been put on pause. So tell us about this legislation
*03:52.420- 03:57.260* :  and why it provoked such an outcry. It's a bit complex, I'll try and simplify as much as I can.
*03:57.260- 04:04.120* :  On Wednesday, the Supreme Court, the top court ruled that the current electoral rules in Indonesia
*04:04.140- 04:10.320* :  unfairly keep out candidates from smaller parties because to fill the candidate for a local election,
*04:10.900- 04:17.080* :  you already need to have 20% of that local Parliament filled with your MPs. So now obviously
*04:17.080- 04:22.700* :  favours the status quo and we were actually set to see a bunch of uncontested elections across
*04:22.700- 04:28.120* :  Indonesia, but the court said no, these smaller parties should be allowed to field candidates even
*04:28.120- 04:33.980* :  if they've only got a handful of representatives. Now the Parliament didn't like that, one of the
*04:33.980- 04:41.340* :  main reasons the Parliament, which is filled with the ruling coalition, was that there was a pretty
*04:41.340- 04:47.500* :  strong vocal critic of the government who was going for mayor of Jakarta. Now under the current
*04:47.500- 04:53.280* :  rules, the ones that the Supreme Court wants to change, he would be barred from standing. So within
*04:53.280- 04:59.280* :  24 hours, the Parliament drafted some emergency legislation that were getting ready to ratify today
*04:59.280- 05:06.260* :  to basically maintain the status quo and there was also some room for interpretation in terms of
*05:06.260- 05:12.020* :  the current president's son being allowed to run as well. So these two key figures involved in
*05:12.020- 05:18.500* :  the controversy. Now though, it seems that they have put this on pause, you would assume that
*05:18.500- 05:22.140* :  is something to do with the thousands of people outside their gates protesting today.
*05:22.640- 05:28.780* :  Nick Marsh in Singapore. As we record this podcast, the four-day extravaganza that is this year's
*05:28.780- 05:34.600* :  Democratic National Convention will soon culminate in Carmel Harris giving a high-stakes speech
*05:34.980- 05:40.860* :  in front of a prime-time television audience just a month after she was catapulted into the race
*05:40.860- 05:46.380* :  to become US President. Despite being Vice President for the past three and a half years, for many
*05:46.380- 05:52.440* :  Americans, she's still a relatively unknown quantity. Even less known is the man she's picked to be
*05:52.440- 05:57.420* :  her running mate, the Midwestern politician Tim Walsh. He gave a widely praised speech at the
*05:57.420- 06:03.420* :  convention, introducing himself to the nation as a teacher, a coach, and a veteran who was proud of
*06:03.420- 06:09.160* :  his small town upbringing, alongside more famous names such as Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.
*06:09.660- 06:17.580* :  Emma Vardy reports from the convention in Chicago. A TV icon was a surprise late addition.
*06:20.320- 06:27.080* :  Oprah Winfrey famously used her huge profile to support Barack Obama in 2008. Now she was back.
*06:27.500- 06:33.620* :  We're now so fired up. We can't wait to leave here and do something.
*06:34.800- 06:38.080* :  But this was her first time addressing a Democratic Convention.
*06:38.420- 06:44.040* :  There are people who want you to see our country as a nation of us against them,
*06:44.700- 06:52.560* :  people who seek first to divide and then to conquer. But here's the thing. When we stand together,
*06:53.820- 06:55.980* :  it is impossible to conquer us.
*06:57.460- 07:01.500* :  Thank you. And when the man chosen by Kamala Harris as her VP,
*07:01.500- 07:07.940* :  but characterized as America's dad to the stage, hundreds of signs held by delegate simply said
*07:07.940- 07:15.400* :  Coach Walsh. Tim Walsh reflected on his life and career from a small town as a veteran, a coach,
*07:15.400- 07:22.380* :  and at a school. So there I was. A 40-something high school teacher with little kids,
*07:23.440- 07:29.140* :  zero political experience, and no money running in a deep red district.
*07:30.940- 07:35.160* :  But you know what? Never underestimate a public school teacher.
*07:36.240- 07:38.900* :  And issued a warning about another Donald Trump presidency.
*07:38.900- 07:43.480* :  When somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they're going to use it.
*07:45.080- 07:50.660* :  And we know if these guys get back in the White House, they'll start jacking up the cost
*07:50.660- 07:54.460* :  on the middle class. They'll repeal the Affordable Care Act.
*07:56.280- 07:59.640* :  And they will ban abortion across this country with or without Congress.
*08:01.180- 08:05.100* :  The mother of dragons, please welcome Nancy Pelosi.
*08:05.920- 08:10.660* :  There's been speculation when it comes to Nancy Pelosi's seemingly strained relationship with
*08:10.660- 08:16.220* :  the president since the Democrat now dubbed the Godmother was a key player in getting Joe Biden
*08:16.220- 08:22.240* :  to step aside. But her speech took aim at Donald Trump's role in the January 6th riots,
*08:22.240- 08:27.140* :  as protesters breached the capital, or she had to find shelter from the violence inside.
*08:27.140- 08:33.360* :  Let us not forget who assaulted democracy on January 6th. He did.
*08:36.520- 08:41.660* :  But let us not forget who saved democracy that day. We did.
*08:46.620- 08:50.060* :  And also addressing the convention another grandee of the party.
*08:50.420- 08:57.520* :  Two days ago, I turned 78 and the only personal vanity I want to assert is I'm still younger than
*08:57.520- 09:01.940* :  Donald Trump. Bill Clinton told delegates Donald Trump was out for himself.
*09:01.940- 09:07.000* :  So the next time you hear him, don't count the lies. Count the eyes.
*09:09.520- 09:16.020* :  When Kamala Harris is president, every day, we'll begin with you, you, you, you.
*09:19.940- 09:22.320* :  Stevie Wonder took to the podium, then the piano.
*09:25.460- 09:30.660* :  The night will be remembered for pairing high-profile celebrity power with down-to-earth appeal
*09:30.660- 09:34.420* :  of timbals, a combination that Democrats are confident is working.
*09:38.500- 09:40.120* :  Keep up the mess.
*09:41.400- 09:48.200* :  For that report by Emma Vardy, the violence continues unabated in Gaza despite the latest
*09:48.200- 09:54.780* :  intense U.S.-led diplomatic efforts. More than 40 people are reported to have been killed by
*09:54.780- 10:00.460* :  Israeli strikes on Gaza in the past day, among them children. In the occupied West Bank,
*10:00.460- 10:04.140* :  three people are reported to have been killed in an Israeli strike on a home.
*10:04.780- 10:10.960* :  And after Israeli warplanes struck deep inside Lebanon, reportedly killing one person and wounding
*10:10.960- 10:16.160* :  30 others, as Bollert launched dozens of rockets at Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.
*10:16.960- 10:21.260* :  Meanwhile, President Biden in a phone call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*10:21.680- 10:25.500* :  has talked about the urgent need for a cease-fire for hostages deal.
*10:26.400- 10:29.960* :  I got more on all this with our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell,
*10:30.300- 10:33.220* :  starting with the latest Israeli attacks on Gaza.
*10:33.960- 10:39.320* :  The Israeli military has made some comments about that saying that overnight it also hit what
*10:39.320- 10:44.460* :  it says was a weapons facility in Gaza City adjacent to the school that was previously hit,
*10:44.460- 10:51.080* :  which it identified as a Hamas Command Center. But certainly Palestinian witnesses told
*10:51.080- 10:56.960* :  journalists that children were among the casualties of that strike on a school, the latest in a
*10:56.960- 11:03.560* :  series of schools, which have been used by displaced people as shelters, that has been hit
*11:03.560- 11:09.460* :  in the past month or so. The latest statement from the Israeli military also talks about eliminating
*11:09.460- 11:16.120* :  what it says are over 50 terrorists in the past day and hitting sites belonging to armed groups,
*11:16.120- 11:21.160* :  including in Raffach, in the very South, in Haneunis, in the South, and indeed a balach in the
*11:21.160- 11:26.340* :  center of the Gaza Strip. We've been hearing from Palestinian medics that there were civilians in
*11:26.340- 11:32.320* :  those different locations as well, who were among those killed and wounded. This morning,
*11:32.320- 11:37.960* :  the Palestinian news agency, Waffa, saying that 11 people have been killed in Betlachia in the
*11:37.960- 11:43.100* :  very north of the Gaza Strip in a strike on a residential building. And there have also been
*11:43.100- 11:48.640* :  these intense exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon at the same time.
*11:49.460- 11:54.780* :  Yeah, we've had in the past couple of days really some of the most intense sort of barrages
*11:55.260- 12:01.780* :  of rockets coming from Hezbollah and many strikes by the Israeli military. Over night, the Israeli
*12:01.780- 12:07.060* :  military says it hit 10 Hezbollah targets in the south of Lebanon, including military warehouses
*12:07.060- 12:11.660* :  and the launch pad. It's very much in the Israeli headlines this morning about the fact about
*12:12.160- 12:17.200* :  50 rockets were fired at an Israeli segment in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights yesterday.
*12:17.200- 12:23.280* :  This being noted that it's a civilian community, not just a military installation. And you know,
*12:23.280- 12:29.320* :  these intense exchanges of fire just add to the sense to know that there could be an all-out war
*12:29.320- 12:33.240* :  that could be the direction we're heading in. And remember that there are tens of thousands of
*12:33.240- 12:39.440* :  people, Israeli and Lebanese civilians who are displaced on both sides of the border by this
*12:39.440- 12:46.060* :  ongoing fighting. So it does seem that despite those intense diplomatic efforts by Anthony Blinken
*12:46.060- 12:52.220* :  in the past few days holding talks with Israeli leaders, holding talks with the leaders in Egypt
*12:52.220- 12:59.280* :  and Qatar, that hopes of a ceasefire may be fading actually because there doesn't seem to be
*12:59.280- 13:06.360* :  any kind of breakthrough. No signs of a breakthrough and indeed, you know, the assessment seems to be
*13:06.900- 13:11.740* :  looking at the media from different parts of the region that the chances are slim of getting
*13:11.740- 13:18.680* :  a breakthrough in upcoming talks in Cairo involving the U.S. and Israeli Egyptian and
*13:18.680- 13:26.260* :  Kateri negotiators. But, you know, we had the U.S. President Joe Biden pressing the Israeli
*13:26.260- 13:31.320* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in this call with the Vice President Kamala Harris,
*13:31.320- 13:39.580* :  importantly joining in as well, really stressing the urgency of sealing a Gaza ceasefire and hostage
*13:39.580- 13:47.180* :  release deal and saying that these talks coming up in Cairo are crucial to remove remaining obstacles.
*13:47.180- 13:52.160* :  But I mean, the signs are that this bridging proposal that the U.S. has put forward is not
*13:52.160- 13:56.980* :  closed the gap between the two sides. Last night, the Israeli Prime Minister's office put out a
*13:56.980- 14:04.280* :  statement, it reiterated that Israel would remain in this strategically important Gaza-Egypt border
*14:04.280- 14:09.980* :  area known as the Philadelphia Corridor. That's really become a main sticking point. It seems
*14:10.060- 14:17.960* :  in the talks between the two sides. Yuland Nell in Jerusalem. The country of Lesotho is completely
*14:17.960- 14:23.680* :  surrounded by South Africa. Despite its relatively small size, it has something its neighbor lacks,
*14:23.680- 14:30.500* :  large amounts of fresh water. Since a deal was signed in 1986, Lesotho has helped keep South African
*14:30.500- 14:36.500* :  taps running with the biggest water transfer scheme in Africa. Water is captured in a dam and
*14:36.500- 14:42.100* :  then transported over the border. But that's left many people in Lesotho itself struggling to
*14:42.100- 14:50.220* :  survive as Andre Lombard reports. It appears shimmering and gleaming as we round a bend in the mountains,
*14:50.220- 14:56.140* :  an engineering marvel completely at odds with the rural countryside of mudhuts and shepherds around
*14:56.140- 15:02.000* :  it. The Katsi Dam holds around 2 billion cubic meters of water. It's the second biggest curved
*15:02.000- 15:07.640* :  dam in Africa, in one of the continent's smallest countries. It contains what Lesotho calls its
*15:07.640- 15:14.380* :  white gold, the water which it sells the neighbouring South Africa for $200 million a year. Lesotho
*15:14.380- 15:18.260* :  might be water rich, but the villagers around the dam don't share that wealth.
*15:22.280- 15:27.180* :  We're on our way to Hare Ramakatsi village, a kilometre from the dam, where we're told water
*15:27.760- 15:33.560* :  insecurity is rife. So we've been here for about half an hour now, and if you can't hear the sound
*15:33.560- 15:38.600* :  of running water behind me, that's because the source, which is a spring in a sort of cave on the
*15:38.600- 15:44.480* :  hillside, has run dry for now. People said they got here from 3 a.m. Those who did were lucky enough
*15:44.480- 15:50.120* :  to carry water back to their houses, but others who arrived from five, which is four or five hours ago
*15:50.960- 15:56.900* :  now are going to have to wait until it starts again. Others are picking water out of a dirty puddle,
*15:57.200- 16:01.720* :  which is full of rubbish and litter, and they tell me often it's quite polluted from up the hill.
*16:02.000- 16:06.880* :  People are saying also that regularly this causes upset stomachs and other illnesses as well.
*16:08.800- 16:13.920* :  At the spring, we meet Manta Boheleng. The 50 year old says she can see the dam from her front
*16:13.920- 16:18.740* :  window, but now she is scooping out water from a puddle at the foot of the dry spring.
*16:21.560- 16:27.400* :  The water shortage situation here is terrible. Sometimes when it rains, a dead dog can be washed
*16:27.440- 16:32.960* :  into the spring. We have to just take it out as we need the water, even if it's contaminated.
*16:34.140- 16:38.720* :  Sometimes when you come to the water, you see little worms, but you still have to drink it because
*16:38.720- 16:43.260* :  there's no way we can survive without it. I'm heading to the capital Masero to meet the minister
*16:43.260- 16:48.280* :  for natural resources, Mahalomi Malekko. Our main objective is going to be going forward,
*16:48.800- 16:55.580* :  to give water to Basu Tu. And then secondly, do the water transfer. And now we have to look at
*16:55.760- 17:02.180* :  the provision of water to the low cost by 2030. That's what we're going to be looking at.
*17:02.600- 17:06.800* :  Demand is very likely to increase for Lesu Tu. A deal has been signed with Botswana,
*17:06.800- 17:12.220* :  700 kilometers away, to pump water there. Lesu Tu will have to find a way of monetising one of
*17:12.220- 17:16.280* :  its biggest natural assets, whilst taking care of the basic needs of its people.
*17:17.880- 17:24.320* :  That report by Andre Nombard. It's the biggest diamond that's ever been found except for one
*17:24.340- 17:30.220* :  unearthed more than a century ago. The massive diamond of nearly two and a half thousand
*17:30.220- 17:35.360* :  carrots was discovered in a mine in Botswana. Not that much smaller than the world's largest,
*17:35.360- 17:40.280* :  which was more than 3,000 carrots, and was found in South Africa nearly 120 years ago.
*17:41.040- 17:45.220* :  Shortly before we recorded this podcast, I asked our Africa Regional Editor,
*17:45.220- 17:48.940* :  Will Ross, if we knew what this new discovery looked like yet.
*17:49.840- 17:53.620* :  We haven't yet seen a picture, but the president of the country,
*17:54.120- 17:58.400* :  the president Macissi, is supposed to be the first person to have a look at it, and we expect it
*17:58.400- 18:04.700* :  to be possibly about the kind of size of a tennis ball, that kind of size. But we don't yet know
*18:04.700- 18:11.380* :  about its quality, but as you say, the biggest since that Cullinan diamond was found back in 1905,
*18:12.280- 18:19.060* :  and that one was sort of 10 centimetres long by six centimetres, that kind of size, a significant size.
*18:20.000- 18:24.320* :  Yes, a stagglingly big. So tell us, how was this enormous diamond found?
*18:24.980- 18:29.960* :  So this was a Canadian firm called Lucara, working up in the northeast of Botswana,
*18:30.520- 18:36.540* :  and it says that basically have found this huge diamond thanks to X-ray technology that it's using,
*18:36.540- 18:41.640* :  and it started deploying these machines in their minds a few years ago, basically,
*18:41.640- 18:47.680* :  to stop the awe from being crushed through these huge machines before they've actually
*18:47.680- 18:53.440* :  knowing what's in it. So this is an X-ray that's done to try and identify the large rough diamonds
*18:53.440- 18:58.900* :  before they go through this machinery. And that's why we've been seeing more larger diamonds
*18:58.900- 19:03.900* :  being discovered in recent years, is it? It seems so. Yeah, it seems that in recent years,
*19:03.900- 19:09.600* :  there have been quite a lot of large diamonds that have been found, sort of compared to years before,
*19:09.600- 19:13.820* :  so it's being put down to that. And tell us about Botswana's diamond industry,
*19:13.820- 19:19.100* :  because in some places, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, the discovery of precious gems
*19:19.100- 19:25.320* :  has been a curse. Yeah, it's had an extraordinary history, really. A former British protector
*19:25.320- 19:32.480* :  that got independence in 1966. It then found its first diamond just months after that,
*19:32.480- 19:41.000* :  which was a huge piece of luck, and they're deep underground, so easier to control in that they're
*19:41.000- 19:47.140* :  not lying near the surface in mud, and that the country has used the money from the diamond
*19:47.140- 19:53.040* :  industry to help develop it. It's still a relatively poor country, but it's used the money fairly
*19:53.040- 20:02.580* :  well and has put a lot of money aside. Well, Ross. Still to come in this podcast, we'll tell you
*20:02.580- 20:08.880* :  about one half of a world famous gay penguin couple who's died leaving behind his partner.

*20:46.400- 20:51.920* :  opposite of what big wireless does. They charge you a lot. We charge you a little. So naturally,
*20:51.920- 20:57.020* :  when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our

*21:22.940- 21:28.200* :  Germany has become one of Kiev's staunchest allies, supplying many billions of dollars of
*21:28.200- 21:34.200* :  military aid. But now, after allegations that this support is wavering, the German Chancellor
*21:34.200- 21:38.840* :  Oleh Schultz has had to defend his country's commitment to Ukraine as it fights off Russia.
*21:39.460- 21:41.920* :  More from our Berlin correspondent, Jessica Parker.
*21:42.840- 21:48.680* :  Berlin's come under fire this week after reports emerged of a freeze on extra military cash
*21:48.680- 21:54.660* :  for Kiev that goes beyond already approved funds. Government sources insist the matters
*21:54.660- 22:00.200* :  still under discussion. But the news comes as this year's allocation of more than 7 billion euros
*22:00.200- 22:06.200* :  is already set to nearly half next year as the fractious coalition government seeks savings.
*22:06.300- 22:11.840* :  Speaking in the Moldovan capital of Kishenau, Chancellor Schultz insisted his country would
*22:11.840- 22:20.620* :  continue to be Ukraine's biggest supporter in Europe. Germany will not decrease its support for
*22:20.620- 22:26.320* :  Ukraine. We will support Ukraine for as long as it is necessary. And we will be the biggest
*22:26.320- 22:32.820* :  national support of Ukraine in Europe. He also pointed to the G7 plan of using frozen Russian assets
*22:32.820- 22:39.060* :  to raise $50 billion for Kiev. But that scheme has yet to be finalised while Germany,
*22:39.060- 22:45.200* :  once again, is facing accusations of failing to sufficiently step up on European security.
*22:46.340- 22:51.540* :  Jessica Parker. Meanwhile, the UN says Ukraine is breaking international law in the way it
*22:51.540- 22:56.360* :  prosecutes people accused of collaborating with Russia. Since the fall scare the invasion,
*22:56.360- 23:00.880* :  more than two years ago, there have been roughly 1800 convictions ranging from
*23:00.880- 23:06.940* :  leaking military secrets to simply justifying the invasion online. Are Ukraine correspondent
*23:06.940- 23:12.380* :  James Waterhouse has gained access to a prison in the east of the country to speak to a convicted
*23:12.380- 23:21.920* :  collaborator? So, we've just moved through the heavy front porch through two big metal gates,
*23:21.920- 23:30.320* :  and now we've gone through another fence. And this is the unit where 62 out of the 428 inmates
*23:30.320- 23:34.740* :  are held, and these are the women convicted of collaborating with the Russianism.
*23:36.720- 23:42.180* :  Led out of the cell is Tehrtiana Potapenko. She's serving a five-year sentence for collaboration.
*23:44.540- 23:51.260* :  I don't deserve to be here at all. When Russian forces took control of a home town of Riemann
*23:51.260- 23:56.540* :  in 2022, she was a neighbourhood volunteer. She continued her role under occupation,
*23:56.640- 24:04.060* :  easing with officials to help the locals. We ran out of food. There was no water.
*24:04.380- 24:10.940* :  Someone had to ask for help for our people. After liberation six months later, prosecutors
*24:10.940- 24:16.260* :  accused Tehrtiana of taking an official job with the occupying authority, which is illegal.
*24:21.060- 24:26.760* :  Across town, we meet Dimitro in his workshop. He used to be an electrician, but is now a mechanic.
*24:28.400- 24:33.600* :  Under Liemann's new Russian rulers, he volunteered and took charge of restoring electricity in the town.
*24:35.200- 24:40.060* :  The Russians said I had to work for them or not at all. There were many armed men around.
*24:40.060- 24:42.580* :  I was afraid they would banish me and my family.
*24:44.800- 24:48.900* :  He was arrested when Liemann was liberated, offered knitting to helping the Russians.
*24:49.280- 24:53.540* :  Dimitro was handed a suspended sentence and banned from working as an electrician.
*24:54.960- 24:59.060* :  I cannot be judged in the same way as collaborators who helped guide missiles.
*25:01.420- 25:06.100* :  The tragedy in the eastern village of Khlasal last year was a striking example of how
*25:06.100- 25:12.520* :  collaboration hurts Ukraine. The walls have been blown away and it is here where there was a funeral
*25:12.520- 25:20.980* :  wake taking place yesterday for a Ukrainian soldier. We were there shortly after 59 people.
*25:21.120- 25:23.660* :  Nearly a quarter of the village were killed by a missile.
*25:25.500- 25:30.300* :  Ukraine's security service soon revealed two local brothers had tipped off the Russians.
*25:30.460- 25:33.920* :  They both fled across the border when the village was liberated.
*25:35.580- 25:40.600* :  Ukraine quickly drafted legislation to make collaboration a crime soon after the invasion,
*25:40.600- 25:45.240* :  but many of those who commit more serious offences are tried and absentia.
*25:45.480- 25:50.340* :  Critics of the law include the United Nations, his Daniel Bell from its monitoring mission.
*25:50.800- 25:55.540* :  There have been crimes that have been carried out in occupied territory and people need to
*25:55.540- 26:01.380* :  be held accountable, but at the same time there have been a number of instances where the law
*26:01.380- 26:08.660* :  has been applied unfairly, including against people for carrying out acts which could lawfully
*26:08.660- 26:14.340* :  be compelled by the occupying authority. I strongly disagree that this legislation is a breach
*26:14.340- 26:20.360* :  of international law. The blunt response from Andrei Usadchuk, one of the MPs who drafted the
*26:20.360- 26:26.860* :  collaboration law. The consequences for such individuals shall be extremely tough because we are
*26:26.860- 26:32.300* :  talking about life and death. What about those who act under duress might be saying what they
*26:32.300- 26:41.080* :  need to to just survive? The law is pretty much clear saying that collaboration is a crime
*26:41.080- 26:50.200* :  if you do it voluntary, but I agree that these legislation require improvements.
*26:51.160- 26:56.060* :  For now this collaboration law is seen as necessary for tough justice. If it means,
*26:56.060- 27:01.380* :  Ukraine can be free of Russia's grasp. That report by James Waterhouse.
*27:02.340- 27:06.820* :  The newly announced boss of Starbucks has come under fire after emerged that he's allowed
*27:06.820- 27:13.780* :  to use a corporate jet for his marathon commute. Brian Nickel lives in California about 1600
*27:13.780- 27:18.920* :  kilometres from the coffee chain's headquarters in Seattle. Emma Simpson reports.
*27:20.100- 27:26.440* :  Starbucks' new CEO could net more than $100 million with his new job, but there's another perk.
*27:26.440- 27:33.240* :  Brian Nickel doesn't have to relocate. Instead he'll get a small remote office near his current home
*27:33.240- 27:39.940* :  and the use of a company jet to take him to his new HQ when needed. The news has prompted a
*27:39.940- 27:46.300* :  backlash on social media with critics accusing the company of hypocrisy, given its public stance on
*27:46.300- 27:52.260* :  green issues. The company also has a hybrid work policy, which means staff need to be in the office
*27:52.260- 27:59.140* :  at least three days a week. Emma Simpson. Cambodia has officially welcomed the return of 70
*27:59.140- 28:04.620* :  ancient statues from collections in the United States. Most of the Buddhist and Hindu stone
*28:04.620- 28:10.760* :  carvings were stolen and illegally exported after the takeover by the genocidal Kim Eruj regime
*28:10.760- 28:18.140* :  in the 1970s. With more details, his Charles Haveland. At a ceremony in Panampen, the Prime Minister
*28:18.140- 28:24.120* :  Hun Manet said the restoration of these 70 artifacts meant that the souls of Cambodia's ancestors
*28:24.120- 28:29.100* :  were being brought back. They were invaluable, he said, part of the national cultural heritage.
*28:29.740- 28:35.280* :  They include statues of Hindu deities, such as Shiva and Pavati, and of a warrior from the
*28:35.280- 28:41.000* :  Mahabharata epic. During the Civil War and the Khmer Rouge genocide, thousands of antiques were
*28:41.000- 28:46.520* :  looted and sold to wealthy buyers and museums in the West. Cambodia hopes these voluntary returns
*28:46.520- 28:53.440* :  will continue. Charles Haveland. It was a love story that captivated the world, but now they have
*28:53.440- 29:00.720* :  been emotional scenes at a zoo in Sydney as penguins and humans mourn the passing of Sven the
*29:00.720- 29:07.700* :  penguin, one half of what many half jokingly refer to as a gay power couple. Sven and his partner
*29:07.700- 29:13.280* :  magic gained global fame after staff at Sydney Zoo, noticed them nesting together and gave them
*29:13.280- 29:19.380* :  an egg to incubate. Stephanie Pentes has this report. Penguins may not be known for their agility,
*29:19.380- 29:25.140* :  but one managed to make a giant leap for gay rights for penguins in his 12-year lifetime.
*29:25.940- 29:33.120* :  Sven the Gen 2 penguin met his partner magic in Sydney Aquarium back in 2018 after a courtship
*29:33.160- 29:39.820* :  involving exchanges of particularly shiny pebbles. The pair became inseparable and began nesting
*29:39.820- 29:44.880* :  together, and after staff gave them an egg and watched them take turns incubating it,
*29:45.160- 29:51.380* :  they were allowed to adopt and raise two chicks. The romance in spite of float in Sydney's world
*29:51.380- 29:57.420* :  famous Mardi Gras gay and lesbian parade has been referenced in Australia's education syllabus
*29:57.420- 30:04.220* :  and even featured in the Netflix series A Typical. When Sven's health began to falter this month,
*30:04.220- 30:11.820* :  staff were concerned. He was 12, and Gen 2 penguins have a lifespan of 12 to 13 years. When he
*30:11.820- 30:18.040* :  passed seemingly of natural causes the team at Sydney Zoo wanted magic to understand that his
*30:18.040- 30:24.400* :  mate wouldn't be coming back amid fears he may keep searching for him. Typically, Gen 2 penguins
*30:31.640- 30:35.560* :  call for a mate like this. But staff at the zoo say upon seeing Sven's body, magic began
*30:35.560- 30:43.220* :  mournfully singing, and the 45 strong penguin colony joined in. Magic then became very protective
*30:43.220- 30:50.180* :  of the body. The Aquarium's manager described the scene as heartbreaking, but other team members
*30:50.180- 30:56.240* :  have taken comfort in the pair's impact as a worldwide symbol of equality, calling it immeasurable.
*30:56.240- 31:02.320* :  The focus now, they say, is on looking after magic. He was entering his first breeding season without
*31:02.320- 31:08.540* :  his partner, sad but still collecting pebbles for a nest, which the team are taking as a promising
*31:08.540- 31:17.280* :  sign. That report by Stephanie Prentice. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new

*31:50.860- 31:57.020* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*31:57.800- 32:04.560* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
