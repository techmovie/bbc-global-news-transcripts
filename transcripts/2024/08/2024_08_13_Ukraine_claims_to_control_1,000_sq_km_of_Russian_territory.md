*01:30.520- 01:33.700* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:36.600- 01:41.740* :  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Tuesday the 13th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:42.460- 01:46.800* :  President Zelensky of Ukraine has said his military's offensive inside Russia's border
*01:46.800- 01:50.540* :  region of Kursk is intended to force Moscow to consider peace.
*01:51.320- 01:54.580* :  As Greece struggles to control wildfires approaching Athens,
*01:54.660- 01:59.400* :  European countries are sending firefighters, aircraft, and vehicles to help.
*02:02.320- 02:03.160* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:03.180- 02:08.020* :  Water is the most important molecule in shaping the evolution of a planet and its climate.
*02:08.200- 02:11.080* :  And we've identified how much of it is present in where it's sitting.
*02:11.720- 02:15.700* :  Scientists have discovered a reservoir of liquid water on Mars
*02:16.120- 02:18.480* :  deep in the rocky crust of the planet.
*02:23.660- 02:27.160* :  Nearly a week into Ukraine's stunning incursion into Russia,
*02:27.180- 02:33.300* :  its army chief says Ukrainian forces have now seized 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory
*02:33.840- 02:37.760* :  and are continuing their offensive operations in the region of Kursk.
*02:38.300- 02:42.380* :  This seems to have been confirmed by the governor of Kursk who caught a dismissive response
*02:42.380- 02:45.760* :  from President Putin when he told him on a video call that
*02:45.760- 02:49.780* :  Kiev's troops had taken control of more than 2,000 villages.
*02:50.480- 02:56.720* :  Ukraine's president Zelensky said his country's actions were designed to force Russia to make peace.
*03:00.300- 03:07.200* :  General Sergei reported that about 1,000 square kilometers in the Kursk region are under control.
*03:07.800- 03:12.360* :  These are in particular the areas from which the Russian army has been striking at our
*03:12.360- 03:18.680* :  Sumy region. As of today and since the 1st of June, there have been almost 2,100 attacks
*03:18.680- 03:24.760* :  on the territory of Sumy region. That is why liberating the border from the Russian military
*03:24.760- 03:27.760* :  is a purely security issue for Ukraine.
*03:28.980- 03:34.600* :  The authorities in Kursk say more than 180,000 people have been forced to flee their homes
*03:35.020- 03:39.440* :  as Russian forces appear to be on the back foot despite their vastly greater manpower.
*03:39.940- 03:44.320* :  President Putin at a meeting of his senior military officials said Kiev's forces
*03:44.700- 03:48.840* :  would be kicked out. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
*03:49.540- 03:54.780* :  Today Vladimir Putin tried to show he's in control and competent of victory.
*03:56.700- 04:02.320* :  He told senior eight that the main task is for the Russian defense ministry to force the
*04:02.320- 04:07.180* :  enemy from Russian land. The adversary, he said, would receive a worthy response.
*04:07.480- 04:13.180* :  The Kremlin leader was referring to Ukrainian troops who seized territory across the border
*04:13.540- 04:16.420* :  in Russia's Kursk region. How much territory?
*04:19.200- 04:25.460* :  The Kursk governor told President Putin that now Ukrainians control 28 settlements in his region
*04:26.080- 04:30.140* :  and had advanced seven miles from the border. The president cut him off.
*04:34.160- 04:36.360* :  Leave the numbers to the military, he told him.
*04:37.300- 04:43.700* :  Officials in Kursk region say that more than 120,000 people have been evacuated from the combat zone.
*04:43.700- 04:49.560* :  Another 60,000 are expected to follow. There's an evacuation, too, in a part of
*04:49.560- 04:54.300* :  neighboring Belgrade region, where there are fears of a similar Ukrainian incursion.
*04:54.300- 05:04.080* :  In Moscow, we saw volunteers organizing a collection of food and clothes to send to evacuees.
*05:04.680- 05:09.180* :  Ilia Kristianinov, who's in charge here, says the dramatic news from southern Russia
*05:09.580- 05:11.600* :  is spurring muskabytes to donate.
*05:11.600- 05:19.120* :  I think everyone is rather stunned and shocked. No one understands what is happening, how this can be,
*05:19.120- 05:25.320* :  but they know that they can help. There are people who lost their homes, they need shelter,
*05:25.320- 05:32.180* :  they need food, they need supplies, and they need medical help, and that's why they're here to help us.
*05:32.740- 05:39.880* :  It was their country that invaded Ukraine, Russians, and now having to deal with unforeseen consequences.
*05:41.120- 05:46.940* :  Steve Rosenberg, so has Ukraine's big gamble in sending its troops into Russia paid off.
*05:47.280- 05:50.700* :  Vitaly Shepchenko, from BBC Monitoring, is following developments.
*05:51.260- 05:57.500* :  The very fact that they're still there almost a week after the incursion started is extraordinary,
*05:57.500- 06:02.460* :  and it's a slap in the face of Vladimir Putin, because if we think back to how this
*06:03.000- 06:07.000* :  special military operation, that's how they call it in Moscow, how it was launched,
*06:07.000- 06:14.520* :  he said Ukraine was preparing to invade Russia or attack Russia, and I'm going to keep you safe.
*06:14.520- 06:18.940* :  I'm going to stop all that. I'm not going to allow any attacks to happen.
*06:18.940- 06:25.720* :  And now, two and a half years into the special military operation, dozens of villages in
*06:25.720- 06:31.760* :  Khrusk region are under Ukrainian control, and the authorities in Moscow, they're trying really hard
*06:31.760- 06:37.440* :  to explain to the public in Russia what's going on. You say it's a slap in the face for Vladimir Putin,
*06:37.920- 06:42.340* :  but what is going on here? Why are Russian forces, given their much greater numbers,
*06:43.080- 06:48.440* :  their greater firepower, not able to get the Ukrainian forces pushed back into their own territory?
*06:48.880- 06:54.280* :  Well, one possible conclusion we can draw from this is that the Russian army isn't as mighty,
*06:54.280- 07:01.700* :  as the Vladimir Putin would want people to believe, and also for the past couple of years,
*07:01.700- 07:08.600* :  it's been focused so heavily on Ukraine's east and Ukraine's southeast that the northeastern
*07:08.600- 07:13.580* :  part of the border between the countries. It hasn't actually been neglected,
*07:13.580- 07:20.380* :  but from what we've seen of the kind of Russian soldiers apparently captured by the Ukrainians,
*07:20.380- 07:25.420* :  they're new, they're fresh, they're inexperienced, and the hard way they've been given
*07:25.420- 07:29.240* :  isn't clearly enough to stop the Ukrainians from advancing.
*07:29.540- 07:32.740* :  Big question is, can Ukraine sustain this, and even bigger one,
*07:32.740- 07:34.920* :  is can this change the dynamic of the war?
*07:35.500- 07:40.020* :  The longer they're there, the more difficult it is for them to stay, because Russia clearly
*07:40.020- 07:44.840* :  is bringing reinforcements into the area and supplying their troops that are still there.
*07:46.040- 07:50.980* :  In enemy territories, that's no mean feat, but the big hope is that Ukraine,
*07:50.980- 07:56.960* :  the big hope of Kiev is that Ukraine will be able to redraw the geography of the conflict,
*07:56.960- 08:02.280* :  distract Russia, and show to the West that it's not necessary to be afraid of any escalation
*08:02.340- 08:05.340* :  by Russia, even if you invade Russia itself.
*08:07.720- 08:12.340* :  As fears grow in Western countries that Iran is about to launch a major attack on Israel,
*08:12.760- 08:17.640* :  the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have called on Tehran
*08:17.640- 08:22.640* :  not to do so. This came after the five Western allies spoke to each other about how to
*08:22.640- 08:27.240* :  de-escalate tensions in the Middle East and secure a ceasefire in the war in Gaza.
*08:27.780- 08:30.620* :  The White House National Security Advisor is John Kirby.
*08:31.180- 08:37.320* :  President Biden spent a little bit of time this morning speaking to his counterparts from the UK,
*08:37.320- 08:43.860* :  from France, from Germany, and Italy, largely to discuss these tensions in the Middle
*08:43.860- 08:49.940* :  East, largely for all the leaders to repeat what they have said before in terms of reaffirming
*08:49.940- 08:55.280* :  Israel's defense, and the need to get a ceasefire in place to get the hostages home,
*08:55.940- 09:02.800* :  and to send a strong message that we don't want to see any rise in violence and any attacks
*09:02.800- 09:08.280* :  by Iran or its proxies. The British Prime Minister, Kirstama, also spoke to the new president of
*09:08.280- 09:14.120* :  Iran, Masoud Pizestian, warning that an attack on Israel in retaliation for the killings of senior
*09:14.120- 09:20.580* :  members of Hamas and Hezbollah would carry a serious risk of miscalculation and would not be in
*09:20.580- 09:24.780* :  anyone's interests. A correspondent Murat Davis is in Jerusalem.
*09:25.380- 09:30.860* :  There have been increasingly credible intelligence reports in Western governments and in the region
*09:30.860- 09:36.760* :  and perhaps an increasing expectation here that sooner rather than later Iran will follow through
*09:36.760- 09:42.820* :  with its vow to respond against Israel either directly or indirectly through Hezbollah.
*09:43.320- 09:48.260* :  For those attacks, beliefs have been carried out by Israel in Iran and in southern Lebanon
*09:48.800- 09:55.500* :  against senior figures in Hamas and Hezbollah. How and when those Iranian responses will take place,
*09:55.500- 10:01.220* :  we simply don't know, but the Israeli government says its military is prepared for an attack.
*10:01.620- 10:06.460* :  All of this comes against increasing international pressure for Iran to pull back from the
*10:06.460- 10:12.320* :  brink. The Americans have increased their naval presence in the region. There's been a coordinated
*10:12.320- 10:19.360* :  effort from the governments of France, Britain and Germany persuading Iran not to go through with an
*10:19.360- 10:24.840* :  attack. The British Prime Minister, Kistama, has spoken to the new Iranian President again,
*10:24.840- 10:31.460* :  emphasizing that level of international concern and saying that any Iranian attack might jeopardize
*10:31.720- 10:36.920* :  a peace talks that are meant to take place later this week, indirectly between Hamas and Israel.
*10:37.500- 10:42.680* :  But it's looking increasingly, perhaps, uncertain that those talks might not even take place.
*10:42.680- 10:48.860* :  It's very difficult to second guess what the new Hamas leader Ya Ya Sinwa and the Israeli
*10:48.860- 10:54.680* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu want to get from those talks and whether either man is prepared
*10:54.680- 11:01.640* :  to make the necessary sacrifices to achieve a ceasefire and to secure the release of those
*11:01.640- 11:08.600* :  hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza. We're at Davis. The Venezuelan government says that
*11:08.600- 11:14.380* :  25 people have died in protest since the contested presidential elections two weeks ago.
*11:14.920- 11:19.680* :  Almost 200 others have reportedly been injured. Leonardo Russia reports.
*11:20.460- 11:25.720* :  The information was shared by President Nicolas Maduro during a cabinet meeting to discuss the
*11:25.720- 11:31.080* :  crisis. Mr. Maduro accused opposition leaders of financing and organizing the attacks,
*11:31.560- 11:37.180* :  and urged the justice system to use an iron fist against them. The UN and human rights groups
*11:37.180- 11:42.600* :  have reported a similar number of victims, but have blamed Venezuela's security forces for
*11:42.600- 11:48.320* :  most of the violence. The opposition candidate Edimundo Gonzalez says he won last month's election
*11:48.320- 11:53.760* :  by a landslide. Many countries in the region, including the United States, have rejected the
*11:53.760- 11:57.580* :  official results, saying there was widespread evidence of fraud.
*11:57.960- 12:02.500* :  Leonardo Russia. Two days after a major wildfire erupted in Greece,
*12:02.640- 12:07.780* :  hundreds of firefighters are battling to stop it spreading as it edges ever closer to the capital
*12:07.780- 12:15.420* :  Athens, with flames towering up to 25 meters high, found by Gailforce Winds. Thousands of people
*12:15.420- 12:23.280* :  have been ordered to evacuate. It hurts. We've grown up in the forest. We feel great
*12:23.280- 12:28.840* :  sadness and anger. Homes have been burned and smoke and ash has descended on Athens,
*12:28.840- 12:33.680* :  with power cuts reported in several parts of the city. A host of European countries,
*12:33.680- 12:40.160* :  France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Romania, Serbia and Turkey are between them sending hundreds
*12:40.160- 12:46.820* :  more firefighters, aircraft and trucks. Soldiers have been called in to help. Demetrius Pipikos
*12:46.820- 12:52.860* :  is a reservist for the Greek army. The situation is chaotic.
*12:53.500- 12:57.540* :  Our military units have been here from the beginning, and we're trying to help the fire unit
*12:57.540- 13:03.800* :  and the volunteer teams, with surrounded by fire here. As summers become hotter in Greece,
*13:03.800- 13:07.980* :  because of climate change, wildfires have become more frequent in recent years,
*13:08.440- 13:12.100* :  underneath Marie-Villy was a deputy mayor of Athens, and is now the global chief
*13:12.100- 13:17.680* :  heat officer for UN Habitat and the Atlantic Council. I've been in tears today because I know
*13:17.680- 13:23.540* :  the places that are being burnt. I love some of these parts of my country. I really, really
*13:23.540- 13:28.080* :  care for them. I've known them since I was a child. In the latest update, as we record this
*13:28.080- 13:33.100* :  podcast, the authorities say there are signs of improvement. They say there's no longer an active
*13:33.100- 13:38.900* :  fire front, but there are still many active hotspots as the hot, windy weather continues.
*13:39.520- 13:42.260* :  We've got more from our correspondent to Athens, Jessica Parker.
*13:42.940- 13:49.980* :  Well, I'm just looking over at a northern suburb of Athens, and there is lots of
*13:49.980- 13:54.460* :  smoke rising from the area, possibly a little bit less than about half an hour ago when we first
*13:54.460- 14:00.120* :  got to this location. But of course, this fire that's been approaching the city of Athens,
*14:00.120- 14:06.920* :  the capital city, began in the north and east regions of Attica around Athens, and that's
*14:06.920- 14:11.660* :  the direction that we're looking out at at the moment. And while we've been here, we can absolutely
*14:11.660- 14:19.520* :  smell that smoke. Not only that, though, I heard explosions, and then I saw, briefly, a sort of small
*14:19.520- 14:25.700* :  fireball, and there have been reports of cars and fuel tanks being caught up in the blaze and
*14:25.700- 14:30.280* :  exploding as a result. I can't say for sure exactly what it was I saw, but it certainly was
*14:30.280- 14:35.540* :  some kind of explosion. And then just a moment ago, as well, there's a helicopter going over that
*14:35.540- 14:40.100* :  area. Clearly, there's lots of resources that have been deployed to the area, whether on the ground
*14:40.100- 14:46.000* :  or from the air, to try and fight the blaze. And how bad is the damage? It's difficult to say,
*14:46.000- 14:51.360* :  at this point, because obviously a lot of the areas that are really badly affected, you can't
*14:51.360- 14:59.200* :  yet go to, but thousands of people have been evacuated. Hospitals have been evacuated. People
*14:59.200- 15:05.860* :  are incredibly worried about their homes, their businesses. That region that I mentioned
*15:05.860- 15:11.820* :  around the sort of northeast of Attica, there's a lot of pine forest, very flammable, so lots of
*15:11.820- 15:18.500* :  concern about destruction to wildlife as well. And now, wildfires in this area have happened
*15:18.620- 15:25.360* :  before. This is a known and very real risk for people who live here, or maybe for people as
*15:25.360- 15:30.520* :  well who come on holiday here or head to the coast. And actually, it wasn't that long ago,
*15:30.820- 15:36.760* :  back in 2018, that over 100 people died in a seaside town in the areas that a blaze ripped
*15:36.800- 15:43.860* :  through there. So it is a very known danger, but I think, again, people are angry and they are
*15:43.860- 15:49.160* :  upset that they're in this position, again, once again, after it's obviously happened over a
*15:49.160- 15:53.680* :  number of years. Some as in Europe are, of course, becoming increasingly hot. You've also got
*15:53.680- 15:59.340* :  gal force winds there. Greece is really struggling to cope, and there's now international aid on the way.
*15:59.780- 16:07.820* :  Yes, France is sending a helicopter, 185 fighters, 55 trucks, Italy's sending two aircraft,
*16:07.820- 16:13.740* :  the Czech Republic, 75 firefighters, Spain and Turkey are also set to send help as well.
*16:14.520- 16:20.440* :  Jessica Parker in Athens is the question that space enthusiasts have been eagerly asking for
*16:20.440- 16:26.520* :  decades. Is there life on Mars? And now there's been a big development that could help to answer
*16:26.520- 16:32.920* :  that question. Scientists say they've identified large reservoirs of liquid water deep within the
*16:32.920- 16:38.440* :  planet's crust. The findings come from a new analysis of data from NASA's InSightlander,
*16:38.600- 16:44.040* :  the probe that touched down a Mars six years ago. Our science correspondent Victoria Gill assesses
*16:44.040- 16:48.740* :  what this discovery means for our hopes of exploring the red planet.
*16:51.580- 16:57.000* :  It's so low-pitched, it's difficult to hear, but this is the rumble of the wind on Mars.
*16:58.060- 17:02.700* :  It was detected by sensors on the InSightlander, which was sent to the red planet in 2018,
*17:02.700- 17:08.580* :  to listen. That's what made this discovery of liquid water possible, as well as sensing the
*17:08.580- 17:15.800* :  Martian breeze, the probe recorded more than 1,300 Mars quakes, vibrations emanating from inside
*17:15.800- 17:22.020* :  the red planet. Scientists have now studied that seismic record in detail to work out exactly how
*17:22.020- 17:27.600* :  Mars moves and what material those seismic waves are traveling through. This showed that deep
*17:27.600- 17:33.140* :  in the rocky Martian crust, inside cracks in the rock, there are large reservoirs of ground water.
*17:33.420- 17:38.220* :  Here's Professor Michael Manger from UC Berkeley. Water is the most important molecule in shaping
*17:38.220- 17:43.200* :  the evolution of a planet and its climate, and we've identified how much of it is present in
*17:43.200- 17:47.560* :  where it's sitting. And when you say a lot of water, like how much and how do you know?
*17:48.140- 17:52.260* :  Excellent question. So we think we know how much space is full of cracks, and those cracks seem
*17:52.260- 17:57.300* :  to be full of water. And if we take all that water and put it on the surface of Mars, it would be a
*17:57.300- 18:02.700* :  layer of water one to two kilometers deep. Mars's surface is etched with channels and ripples
*18:02.700- 18:06.800* :  that paint a picture of its watery past, and the researchers believe that this discovery
*18:06.800- 18:12.280* :  answers the question, where did all that water go? But they say tapping into it to supply future
*18:12.280- 18:17.280* :  human exploration of Mars will be very challenging. The reservoirs they've detected are at depths
*18:17.280- 18:22.020* :  of between 10 and 20 kilometers, which would be difficult to drill even here on Earth.
*18:22.880- 18:31.060* :  Victoria Gill. Still to come. They've done a great job so far in getting this bird to this age
*18:31.060- 18:37.200* :  a few days old and feeding him and keeping him safe. The two male flamingos who've hatched an egg
*18:37.400- 18:40.220* :  and become caring fathers to a chick.
*19:20.800- 19:25.260* :  It's a question that keeps business leaders up at night. How do you go from thinking about
*19:25.260- 19:31.820* :  change to actually making it happen? How do I start? Where do I start? What is the use case?
*19:31.820- 19:37.160* :  Where's the value? From the AI revolution? This is the most amazing time ever,
*19:37.500- 19:44.100* :  and developments in AI are super super quickly changing. To the urgent need for sustainability and
*19:44.100- 19:51.200* :  resilience. The physical climate risk predicted in the climate models has arrived. The way we do
*19:51.200- 19:57.940* :  business is transforming fast, but we're here to help. I'm Chip Kleinexel, host of resilient
*19:57.940- 20:03.080* :  Edge, a new business vitality podcast paid and presented by Deloitte and produced by BBC
*20:03.080- 20:09.080* :  StoryWorks Commercial Productions. It's a guide to implementing and sustaining change at scale.
*20:09.760- 20:12.120* :  Coming soon, everywhere you listen to podcasts.
*20:20.200- 20:24.560* :  More than 20 people are now known to have died after a landslide at a massive
*20:24.560- 20:28.560* :  rubbish dump in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, according to police.
*20:29.120- 20:33.120* :  Rescuers are continuing to dig through the waste in the hope of finding more survivors
*20:33.120- 20:38.880* :  after the landslide on Friday, which followed weeks of torrential rain. Police say that five
*20:38.880- 20:44.820* :  children are among the dead. This resident, Mohamed Kirondi, lost seven members of his family
*20:44.820- 20:53.380* :  in the disaster. I have lost my family here in Kitesi at the landfill. I have lost seven loved ones.
*20:54.120- 20:58.600* :  The garbage barred them under. My wife and children are all dead.
*21:00.100- 21:03.020* :  We have retrieved four bodies, but the rest have not yet been found.
*21:03.720- 21:07.520* :  The site is still going on. We hope they will be found.
*21:09.060- 21:14.920* :  The Kitesi landfill, which covers an area that's roughly the size of about 20 football pitches,
*21:15.600- 21:21.480* :  is the only one serving the whole of Kampala, a city home to an estimated four million people.
*21:22.220- 21:25.660* :  Shamim Nabakusa is a Ugandan journalist in Kampala.
*21:26.300- 21:31.580* :  What we can confirm is security has a number of 21 individuals are discovered dead,
*21:32.020- 21:36.840* :  but also the authorities from within the area who say it's about 23 individuals. So there's
*21:36.840- 21:40.900* :  a little bit of mismatch in the numbers, but for government what we can take is 21 of those.
*21:41.360- 21:46.380* :  And also what we are sure of is that whenever courses are advanced at that point, at least
*21:47.080- 21:52.100* :  quick attention to individuals who are on the site, but also how much can be done in terms of
*21:52.100- 21:56.800* :  excavation to find out for the bodies that could be from within, because we know Kitesi is
*21:56.800- 22:02.420* :  a very highly populated area. And so each family could have lists of individuals within a home
*22:02.700- 22:07.520* :  at least seven. So most of the families could have numbers that are more than what is expected.
*22:07.520- 22:14.040* :  But also because of how the area is and the uphill that it had become, you expect that even many
*22:14.040- 22:19.200* :  children got down the slope to play if have been able to watch the videos or that very length,
*22:19.460- 22:25.360* :  the slopes of the main Kitesi road down to that field. Children and many could be still trapped
*22:25.360- 22:29.920* :  down there in the landfill because it gives an easy route for children to play and even for the
*22:29.920- 22:34.660* :  individuals who live along the roads there because it seeps from within and it gives an easy ride
*22:34.660- 22:38.980* :  for anybody who wants to go there and get to see. But it's still a tough task. It will be hard
*22:38.980- 22:43.560* :  one for government to deal with. And until a misfortune like this happens, that's when often
*22:43.560- 22:49.780* :  government wakes up and gets to realize that there's such a big challenge to deal with and we know
*22:49.780- 22:56.060* :  that maybe this would be a wake up call for government. Individuals are still trapped from within.
*22:56.060- 23:01.260* :  It could be a wake up call for government. Also, the only unfortunate is whether head will have to
*23:01.480- 23:08.120* :  roll on this very one and how much has been sunk into the garbage business itself in just Kitesi
*23:08.380- 23:13.460* :  alone about forbidden shillings. Papai Nasria is fed in there. It's kind of the Minister of
*23:13.460- 23:18.860* :  Campala and the Campala Capacity Authority be able to account how this money has been utilized
*23:18.860- 23:25.580* :  and how they were able to watch over a population die over something that they have known here for
*23:25.580- 23:33.540* :  a year. That was Shamim Nabakusa in Uganda. Outside Indonesia, it's bound to become a general
*23:33.540- 23:41.060* :  knowledge question. What is Indonesia's capital? Jakarta, of course. But sometime not so far away,
*23:41.060- 23:48.160* :  that answer will be wrong. It will be Nusantara. The city is being built in a forested area on the
*23:48.160- 23:55.680* :  island of Borneo, about 1,200 kilometers from Jakarta. Andreka Natalegawa is an associate fellow
*23:55.760- 24:00.380* :  for the Southeast Asia Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
*24:00.380- 24:07.060* :  DC. Owen Bennett Jones asked him why they're moving the capital. Part of the reasons why the
*24:07.060- 24:12.900* :  current Indonesian government under President Joko Riddodo has decided to move the capital city of
*24:12.900- 24:19.400* :  Jakarta over to Nusantara, the new capital city location is manifold, right? The multiple reasons
*24:19.400- 24:24.780* :  why. First and foremost is that Jakarta currently faces serious environmental challenges
*24:25.360- 24:30.440* :  related to the usage of groundwater. And as such, the capital city is currently sinking.
*24:31.040- 24:35.440* :  And so the government has decided that in order to alleviate some of these environmental
*24:35.440- 24:40.920* :  concerns, you know, deciding to move the capital city to this new site on the island of Borneo,
*24:41.460- 24:46.560* :  in order to move, alleviate these environmental concerns and shift the government and sort of the
*24:46.560- 24:51.800* :  seat of power away from Jakarta, which as it currently stands is currently the entertainment,
*24:51.800- 24:58.780* :  the business and other hub of the Indonesian country. Sinking how fast? At a very fast rate.
*24:58.780- 25:03.840* :  It's expected that, you know, by the middle of the century, over about a third of the city will
*25:03.840- 25:09.460* :  be underwater, right? And so there's a serious concern just about what this means for people who
*25:09.460- 25:14.960* :  live there, the government and how it functions. And so the selection of Nusantara, the new site
*25:14.960- 25:19.840* :  as the capital city, is in part a reflection of these spheres of environmental disasters.
*25:19.840- 25:25.660* :  The island of Borneo is less susceptible to, for instance, geological events related to earthquakes
*25:25.660- 25:33.040* :  and volcanoes. And so there's some safety in selecting this site due to its lesser risk of natural
*25:33.040- 25:37.920* :  disasters. But I was reading it's quite remote the new site, isn't it? So how will communications
*25:37.920- 25:43.660* :  turn from work? Well, that's right. So this new site currently rests on what was formerly,
*25:43.740- 25:50.180* :  I believe, an industrial, so a forestry zone. But there are other major cities on the island of
*25:50.180- 25:54.480* :  Borneo. And in the Indonesian portion of the island in Borneo, and I'd point to cities like
*25:54.480- 26:00.880* :  Polankaraya, for example. So there are urban centers scattered across the island. But compared to
*26:00.880- 26:06.980* :  Jakarta, the current capital city, the Nusantara site is fairly remote. It still takes some time to
*26:06.980- 26:12.980* :  drive from the new site to the existing cities around it. There needs to be a build out in terms of
*26:12.980- 26:18.140* :  highways, in terms of ports, in terms of airports. And these are all part of the plan as it relates
*26:18.140- 26:23.260* :  to the government as it's building out this new capital city site. Andrika Natal Elgawa.
*26:23.980- 26:30.000* :  It was an ordeal twice over. First, the glamour model Chloe Ailing was kidnapped from a photo
*26:30.000- 26:36.820* :  shoot in Milan in 2017. Then she faced a backlash from British tabloid newspapers which accused her
*26:36.820- 26:43.540* :  of lying. Her story is being re-examined now in a BBC drama entitled Kidnapped the Chloe Ailing
*26:43.540- 26:47.720* :  story. Our culture reporter, Yasmin Rufo, has been speaking to her.
*26:49.320- 26:53.380* :  It's the story of a kidnap model that caught the world's attention.
*26:54.160- 26:58.960* :  The reason Italy are investigating the kidnapping of a British model, so she was held for nearly a week.
*26:58.960- 27:04.620* :  Her captors demanded a 230,000 pounds. Seven years ago, Chloe Ailing was grabbed,
*27:04.620- 27:11.000* :  drugged and woke in the boot of a car, bound and gagged. Her kidnapper had driven her 120 miles
*27:11.000- 27:17.780* :  to a remote farmhouse where he demanded a $300,000 ransom. Six days later, he released her at the
*27:17.780- 27:22.940* :  British consulate. I've been for a terrifying experience. I feared for my life second by second,
*27:22.940- 27:28.000* :  minute by minute. I am incredibly grateful. Now, a new BBC drama Kidnapped is telling the former
*27:28.000- 27:34.040* :  glamour model story with her involvement. All I wanted was facts to be laid out and everyone to
*27:34.040- 27:39.260* :  know what actually happened. But her story hasn't always been believed. People just read the headlines
*27:39.280- 27:44.000* :  and don't dig deeper into the case, so when you're seeing a headline that it was fake,
*27:44.200- 27:47.480* :  so it's going to stick in someone's mind and they're going to think that and assume that.
*27:47.740- 27:53.160* :  The tabloids accused her of faking her abduction, profiting from it and being involved in a publicity
*27:53.160- 27:57.740* :  stunt. If the whole trial was transcribed in the media, there wouldn't be a single doubt in
*27:57.740- 28:03.080* :  anyone's mind, which is what the drama shows, but it's because they only would blow up headlines,
*28:03.080- 28:07.480* :  saying that he said it was a publicity stunt, because that's what everyone else was saying.
*28:07.480- 28:12.840* :  But they didn't mention the fact he changed his story multiple times. First said he had leukemia,
*28:12.840- 28:18.040* :  needed to raise money, then he was hired by Remanians, and like his story was never just one story,
*28:18.040- 28:22.100* :  and that was never shared. Even the writer of the new drama, Georgia Lester,
*28:22.440- 28:27.060* :  didn't know what to make of Chloe's story at first. I don't think I read the articles, to be honest.
*28:27.060- 28:30.280* :  I think I read the headlines and probably like most people I did make a snap judgment.
*28:30.560- 28:35.720* :  She hopes the show will give people a new perspective on Chloe's story and how the media treats
*28:35.720- 28:41.420* :  victims. They didn't have all of the facts and they were much more pointed to the way she behaved,
*28:41.420- 28:46.560* :  the way she dressed, and the job that she did opposed to actually the trauma that she had in
*28:46.560- 28:50.840* :  court. Chloe's experience of not being believed is more common than you might expect.
*28:51.300- 28:55.080* :  We often hear stories of survivors telling us that we are the first people that actually believe
*28:55.080- 29:00.120* :  them. Josie will be from the Women's Charity Solace that supports survivors of gender-based violence,
*29:00.180- 29:06.500* :  says that many victims have a very similar story. I think we often feel that unless a survivor is
*29:06.500- 29:11.700* :  the perfect survivor, that we don't believe them because maybe they aren't seen as vulnerable
*29:11.700- 29:16.000* :  enough, they aren't responding to the trauma in the way that we sort of want them to as a society,
*29:16.000- 29:21.440* :  so for example they're not crying or upset. If I was not a model, do you think people would have
*29:21.440- 29:27.120* :  the same opinions of me? I don't think so, no. At the time I had no control over it. There were
*29:27.120- 29:32.340* :  things that were missed out. It was all going in a direction that was not true. Looking back,
*29:32.340- 29:37.020* :  would you, for example, in that initial press statement that you gave, do you almost wish that
*29:37.020- 29:42.160* :  you'd forced yourself to cry just so you could get everyone off your back? No, because that would be
*29:42.160- 29:47.400* :  faking how I'm acting. I shouldn't have to fake how I'm acting. That was genuinely how I was
*29:47.400- 29:52.000* :  feeling at the time. I was happy to be home. I was happy this was over, so why shouldn't I be
*29:52.000- 29:59.440* :  smiling? This should be a lesson for people not to judge victims based on the way they act or
*29:59.820- 30:07.860* :  react to something bad happening. Former Klammer model Chloe Ailing ending that report by Yasmine
*30:07.860- 30:14.300* :  Rufo. A zoo in the southwest of England is celebrating two proud fathers who have successfully
*30:14.340- 30:20.100* :  hatched an egg. It's believed that two male flamingos adopted the egg after it was abandoned by
*30:20.100- 30:33.100* :  another couple. Harry Bly reports. These are the Chilean flamingos who live at Peyton Zoo in the
*30:33.100- 30:43.620* :  county of Devon in southwest England, home to Curtis and Arthur. These vibrant pink birds are part
*30:43.620- 30:50.560* :  of what the zoo calls the Love Lagoon, a homage to the popular reality TV series Love Island.
*30:51.540- 30:58.420* :  This pair of male flamingos, Curtis and Arthur are one of several flamingo couples to have hatched
*30:58.420- 31:05.340* :  chicks at the zoo for the first time in six years. And while neither male laid this egg,
*31:05.340- 31:10.720* :  they're raising the chick as their own. They're doing a fantastic job and we see them swapping over
*31:10.720- 31:16.760* :  quite often. We've seen both of the parents feeding the chick and defending the chick, you know,
*31:16.760- 31:21.800* :  they've done a great job so far and getting this bird to this age a few days old and feeding him
*31:21.800- 31:29.460* :  and keeping him safe. This is Lisa Ward, team leader of birds at the zoo. It's not known exactly how
*31:29.460- 31:35.620* :  Curtis and Arthur acquired this egg, but it's thought to have something to do with a surge in the
*31:35.620- 31:41.320* :  number of breeding pairs this year, meaning the flamingos are building nests closer together.
*31:41.600- 31:46.140* :  So what we think has happened is that the pair that laid the egg for every reason possibly because
*31:46.140- 31:52.040* :  of aggression around the nest have left it and so this other pair have come in and adopted it
*31:52.400- 31:57.660* :  and have done a great job and have hatched it and are now rearing it. This is by no means the first
*31:57.660- 32:03.840* :  time same sex parenting has been observed in the avian world. Here's Lisa Ward again.
*32:04.000- 32:08.260* :  It does happen, I think I'm right in saying it happens a lot with large social species that
*32:08.260- 32:12.980* :  live in large groups, what happens fairly frequently in penguins and also with flamingos as well.
*32:13.460- 32:19.860* :  The chick who is yet to be named will be raised by its two dads for around three months before
*32:19.860- 32:28.200* :  it's time to fly the nest. Harry Blie. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition
