*00:16.160- 00:16.880* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.880- 00:21.600* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.600- 00:22.940* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:23.320- 00:23.960* :  They said yes.
*00:24.340- 00:28.360* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those honorists to your contracts,
*00:28.360- 00:30.740* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.780- 00:32.340* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*00:32.600- 00:37.920* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:19.680- 01:22.820* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.120- 01:31.320* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh and at 1400 GMT on Thursday the 29th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:31.320- 01:35.860* :  The EU's foreign policy chief has accused some Israeli government ministers of issuing
*01:35.860- 01:39.160* :  hate messages against Palestinians and has proposed sanctions.
*01:40.240- 01:45.040* :  South Korea's constitutional court has ruled that the government's climate policies don't
*01:45.040- 01:48.980* :  go far enough in a landmark case brought by hundreds of young people.
*01:50.200- 01:55.000* :  Two editors of a Hong Kong news website have been found guilty of sedition in the
*01:55.000- 01:58.460* :  latest move by the authorities to stifle independent reporting.
*02:01.640- 02:07.380* :  Also in this podcast, because we've learnt such a lot about virus technology and actually
*02:07.380- 02:12.540* :  vaccine technology in COVID, it means that once we know what to target, we can rapidly
*02:12.540- 02:13.760* :  make these vaccines.
*02:14.440- 02:17.240* :  Hope's rise for the development of a cancer vaccine.
*02:22.560- 02:26.940* :  As the Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank continues for a second day,
*02:26.940- 02:32.660* :  with 17 people killed according to Palestinian health officials, the European Union's foreign
*02:32.660- 02:36.520* :  policy chief, Josep Berrell, has condemned Israel's action.
*02:36.980- 02:41.840* :  He said he would consult with EU foreign ministers on whether to impose sanctions on his
*03:04.280- 03:06.980* :  Israeli government ministers.
*03:10.720- 03:16.400* :  This follows calls by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for Israel to halt its military
*03:16.460- 03:17.040* :  operation.
*03:17.740- 03:21.800* :  I've been speaking to John Donerson, our correspondent in Janine, in the West Bank.
*03:22.420- 03:24.760* :  This operation is ongoing.
*03:24.760- 03:30.280* :  We drove into Janine this morning and all roads but one was shut off by the Israeli army.
*03:30.280- 03:37.240* :  We were warned by Palestinian taxi drivers that Palestinian cars were being shot at by Israeli
*03:37.240- 03:37.760* :  soldiers.
*03:37.860- 03:42.120* :  I mean, this is normally a bustling and vibrant, busy town.
*03:42.440- 03:46.720* :  The streets are absolutely deserted and all the businesses are boarded up.
*03:47.440- 03:49.680* :  And what are the Palestinian authorities saying?
*03:50.500- 03:56.940* :  Well, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is in power
*03:56.940- 04:03.640* :  and controls parts of the West Bank, has warned that the escalating Israeli raids will
*04:03.640- 04:06.920* :  lead to dire and dangerous results.
*04:07.500- 04:13.060* :  And then we had another quite senior Palestinian politician, Mustafa Barguiti, who told the BBC
*04:13.060- 04:18.540* :  this morning that he believed that Israel was trying to bring war to the West Bank.
*04:19.400- 04:24.060* :  Has there been any response from Israel to the criticisms by the UN and the EU?
*04:25.080- 04:25.640* :  Not really.
*04:25.780- 04:30.780* :  And to be honest, I think that that criticism will be water offered up to back, really.
*04:30.780- 04:35.440* :  Israel is no stranger to criticism from the UN and the EU.
*04:35.760- 04:39.620* :  They say they are carrying out counterterrorism operations.
*04:40.000- 04:47.060* :  They say they are taking out weapons supplies and taking out Palestinian militants in
*04:47.060- 04:50.400* :  Tulkaram, in the North Shams refugee camp.
*04:50.400- 04:56.880* :  They say they eliminated a senior Islamic Jihad militant there yesterday.
*04:57.500- 05:02.360* :  And they believe that they need to carry out this operation to protect their citizens.
*05:03.180- 05:06.880* :  And all this, of course, fueling fears that the conflict will escalate further.
*05:08.000- 05:11.840* :  Yeah, I mean, that's what's important, I think, for weeks now, diplomats have been
*05:11.900- 05:18.400* :  trying to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and simmer down tensions
*05:18.900- 05:19.920* :  in the region.
*05:19.920- 05:24.160* :  We had that big escalation at the weekend between Hezbollah and Lebanon and Israel.
*05:24.360- 05:26.720* :  And now we've got this third front.
*05:26.780- 05:33.600* :  So the fear is that what's happened in Gaza, the war there, could spread into a wider regional
*05:33.960- 05:34.080* :  conflict.
*05:34.840- 05:35.460* :  John Donerson.
*05:36.640- 05:41.340* :  A cancer vaccine is probably the holy grail when it comes to preventing the disease that
*05:41.340- 05:43.580* :  takes so many lives around the world every year.
*05:43.960- 05:49.160* :  A vaccine would be able to better target the cancer and be less invasive than current
*05:49.160- 05:49.600* :  treatment.
*05:50.460- 05:55.320* :  Now, scientists from the UK, the US and Australia have made a breakthrough that it's hoped
*05:55.320- 05:57.980* :  will make the development of a vaccine more likely.
*05:58.780- 06:03.000* :  We got more from Professor Pat Price, a cancer expert from Imperial College London.
*06:03.600- 06:09.580* :  It's a very exciting development because we all want cancer vaccines just as we know our
*06:09.580- 06:11.680* :  immune system can fight viruses.
*06:12.260- 06:17.220* :  If this can fight cancers, that would be so much better, targeted, less effect on normal
*06:17.240- 06:18.760* :  tissue and really effective.
*06:19.480- 06:24.900* :  And this study, you think, brings us a move closer towards a vaccine?
*06:25.580- 06:26.360* :  Oh, absolutely.
*06:26.540- 06:31.180* :  We know we've made great progress in other areas, but this is a fantastic study worked
*06:31.220- 06:32.880* :  with the Americans and the Australians.
*06:33.480- 06:37.220* :  So in this one, they've looked at one of the immune system.
*06:37.220- 06:42.160* :  That's the natural killer cells that really just detect and smash up viruses.
*06:42.760- 06:46.240* :  They've found a protein in the cancer that it targets.
*06:46.240- 06:50.680* :  And if they can smash up that, then that would be really effective and they've even developed
*06:50.680- 06:55.860* :  in the laboratory a small bit of the protein that's in the cancer cells, so perfectly harmless.
*06:56.320- 06:58.960* :  And that stimulates those killer cells.
*06:59.260- 07:01.700* :  And if they could make that into a vaccine, that would be great.
*07:02.560- 07:07.460* :  I suppose a fair number of listeners will think of a vaccine as something that stops you
*07:07.460- 07:10.100* :  getting a disease entirely.
*07:10.760- 07:16.440* :  This as I understand it would not be the case with this vaccine, but it would make subsequent
*07:17.020- 07:18.920* :  treatment that much less invasive.
*07:18.920- 07:19.440* :  Is that right?
*07:20.100- 07:20.800* :  Yes, that's right.
*07:20.860- 07:26.400* :  We know that there are some viruses that cause cancer, like the HPV virus, and we now
*07:26.400- 07:29.360* :  have a vaccination program for children with that, and that's great.
*07:29.360- 07:33.300* :  So that will stop you getting the cancer from the virus.
*07:33.760- 07:38.900* :  But this is one once you've got the cancer and you've had that perhaps removed, but you
*07:38.900- 07:41.220* :  know that sort of what's in your own cancer.
*07:41.220- 07:44.940* :  Then if you can make the vaccine to that, that should be able to stop it coming back,
*07:45.300- 07:46.100* :  which will be brilliant.
*07:46.600- 07:49.400* :  We often have these fabulous bits of news about research.
*07:49.980- 07:53.080* :  The next question is always right when.
*07:53.360- 07:56.580* :  We know we've got some cancer vaccines in trial at the moment.
*07:56.620- 08:01.820* :  This one they've done the laboratory studies, so they will have to now work it up to actually
*08:02.380- 08:04.440* :  make it into a vaccine and then trial it.
*08:04.480- 08:08.600* :  So this one isn't going to be available for patients for several years, but there are
*08:08.600- 08:08.920* :  others.
*08:09.100- 08:11.280* :  But the main thing is this is a great direction.
*08:11.620- 08:17.080* :  And because we've learnt such a lot about virus technology and actually vaccine technology
*08:17.080- 08:22.260* :  in COVID, it means that once we know what to target, we can rapidly make these vaccines.
*08:22.760- 08:25.360* :  So this is going to accelerate this work.
*08:25.780- 08:29.300* :  But this, you know, cancer is such a bad news story often.
*08:29.480- 08:35.240* :  But if we all these new ways and these better ways, it's so exciting and so encouraging
*08:35.280- 08:37.380* :  for patients and for the whole public out there.
*08:38.020- 08:40.300* :  Professor Pat Price talking to Johnny Diamond.
*08:41.400- 08:46.640* :  To Argentina now, where police have clashed with demonstrating old age pensioners in the
*08:46.640- 08:47.660* :  capital Buenos Aires.
*08:48.540- 08:53.080* :  The protesters were angry after President Javier Melae said he would veto a pension increase,
*08:53.500- 08:55.120* :  which had been pushed through by the Senate.
*08:55.640- 09:00.120* :  He maintains he needs to tackle the country's high inflation with austerity measures.
*09:00.920- 09:06.340* :  Riot police fired tear gas, pepper spray and beat the elderly demonstrators as they protested
*09:06.360- 09:07.540* :  near the National Congress.
*09:08.600- 09:10.640* :  These people explained why they'd got involved.
*09:11.680- 09:17.640* :  We are here to say enough Melae, this can't go on any longer.
*09:18.120- 09:22.140* :  He has targeted the young people, the pensioners, education, health care.
*09:22.700- 09:24.460* :  There's nothing left to take from us.
*09:25.040- 09:25.660* :  It's over.
*09:26.000- 09:26.960* :  He needs to go.
*09:27.640- 09:28.680* :  He needs to go.
*09:30.020- 09:35.360* :  We are here not just because we want a higher pension, but because of the cost of living.
*09:35.860- 09:42.280* :  What it means to be able to use transportation, to be able to eat, our basic needs are at
*09:42.280- 09:42.660* :  stake.
*09:43.360- 09:47.880* :  And that's why we have to be supportive and participate all of us.
*09:48.800- 09:53.040* :  Members of the opposition have condemned the deployment of riot police, saying the measure
*09:53.040- 09:54.140* :  amounted to repression.
*09:54.900- 09:59.000* :  I got more details from our Latin America online editor, Vanessa Bushluter.
*09:59.800- 10:01.500* :  The footage is quite shocking.
*10:01.500- 10:07.200* :  You see the police spraying these pensioners, some of whom were in their 80s with pepper spray
*10:07.200- 10:10.380* :  from a short distance and also using their truncheons on them.
*10:11.020- 10:16.080* :  It is unusual because the pensioners have been protesting every week in front of Congress.
*10:16.720- 10:23.220* :  But this week there was a larger protest expected because of that veto that Mr. Melae, the president
*10:23.220- 10:27.640* :  wants to put in against these pension reforms.
*10:28.460- 10:32.160* :  And the police were deployed to really crack down.
*10:32.220- 10:37.400* :  There have been stricter measures, stricter policing of protests because the government
*10:37.400- 10:42.280* :  of Mr. Melae wants to prevent roads from being blocked, which happened a lot in Argentina
*10:42.280- 10:43.600* :  during these protests.
*10:44.060- 10:49.800* :  And so as soon as the protestors, these pensioners went on to the street, they were beaten back
*10:50.040- 10:50.960* :  onto the pavement.
*10:51.600- 10:54.440* :  And criticism from the opposition, calling it repression?
*10:55.380- 10:55.980* :  Absolutely.
*10:56.680- 11:02.760* :  And not just the opposition, but also of course the pensioners themselves and all of the groups
*11:02.760- 11:09.220* :  which give them their support, who say that these pensioners have got a legitimate grievance,
*11:09.600- 11:14.220* :  year-and-year inflation in July was stood at 263%.
*11:14.300- 11:19.940* :  And of course, pensioners say they can't pay for electricity, for heating, for food even
*11:19.940- 11:20.680* :  in some cases.
*11:21.120- 11:26.520* :  And so this new measure, which we'll see their pensions increase in line with inflation
*11:26.580- 11:27.500* :  to them is crucial.
*11:27.500- 11:29.240* :  It's a matter of survival, they say.
*11:29.560- 11:30.780* :  But Mr. Melae's adamant.
*11:31.620- 11:32.100* :  Absolutely.
*11:32.540- 11:38.400* :  Mr. Melae says that you can't spend, spend, and spend without planning on how to finance
*11:38.400- 11:39.440* :  such a spending.
*11:39.500- 11:47.900* :  He says that he was voted in with a large majority to bring down debt and that his plan
*11:47.900- 11:53.700* :  is to bring down the exorbitant costs, which if measures like these are passed, then
*11:54.260- 11:56.060* :  other vulnerable people will have to pay for.
*11:56.100- 11:59.880* :  So he says he's protecting other vulnerable people who would have to foot the bill.
*12:00.260- 12:04.800* :  Vanessa Bush-Luta, while in Singapore, the government has come up with a simple solution
*12:04.800- 12:07.260* :  for less well-off older people, keep working.
*12:08.020- 12:12.440* :  Along with many countries, the Southeast Asian city-state is grappling with the challenge
*12:12.440- 12:15.480* :  of people living longer and having fewer children.
*12:16.240- 12:21.820* :  It's facing a future in which a shrinking, younger workforce will have to prop up an ever-expanding
*12:21.820- 12:23.000* :  group of pensioners.
*12:23.760- 12:28.240* :  Our reporter Nick Marsh went to meet some older people who are following the advice to keep
*12:28.280- 12:28.880* :  on working.
*12:30.960- 12:34.120* :  Madam Go is well-known in this part of Singapore.
*12:34.180- 12:39.220* :  It's her job to deliver lunch and dinner to people who struggle to leave their homes.
*12:39.540- 12:42.280* :  Next book is 22.
*12:42.960- 12:49.100* :  Living alone, she signed up to a scheme which uses government money to offer retirees paid
*12:49.100- 12:50.880* :  odd jobs in their community.
*12:51.200- 12:53.960* :  I do nothing at home, sipping, mopping.
*12:54.780- 13:00.340* :  So in this challenge comes by, I just grab to make my life more fulfilling and more
*13:00.340- 13:00.900* :  personal.
*13:01.200- 13:06.900* :  The number of Singaporeans who live alone like Madam Go has shot up in the past few years.
*13:07.420- 13:10.760* :  People are living longer, but having fewer babies.
*13:10.820- 13:16.280* :  This inevitably threatens traditional living arrangements where elderly parents would
*13:16.280- 13:18.300* :  tend to stay with their grown-up children.
*13:18.560- 13:22.560* :  It presents a big challenge, both socially and economically.
*13:22.560- 13:27.040* :  I mean, naturally, people want to retire at early age and drive their life.
*13:27.440- 13:31.900* :  Dr. Sui Ler is an economist at the National University of Singapore.
*13:32.180- 13:37.980* :  But it's not sustainable, and that is going to become a very heavy burden for the government.
*13:38.440- 13:39.340* :  So what's the solution?
*13:39.980- 13:45.100* :  Well, working further into old age would solve a lot of problems.
*13:45.800- 13:51.220* :  You simultaneously ease the tax burden and give senior citizens something to do.
*13:53.300- 13:57.820* :  But for people who have worked hard their entire life, that's not exactly the most thrilling
*13:57.820- 13:58.320* :  prospect.
*13:59.220- 13:59.980* :  Back into work.
*14:02.280- 14:03.600* :  I don't want to go anymore.
*14:03.600- 14:03.980* :  I don't want to go anymore.
*14:03.980- 14:04.440* :  No use.
*14:06.060- 14:11.160* :  I went down to a popular spot in Chinatown where groups of retired men often like to hang
*14:11.160- 14:13.580* :  out, drinking beer, playing board games.
*14:13.960- 14:15.000* :  He's also a problem.
*14:15.680- 14:16.980* :  Who is going to employ you and not be?
*14:17.460- 14:20.280* :  They're looking for young guys, young people, youngsters and all this.
*14:20.800- 14:25.600* :  Now, Singapore's government clearly knows this, and it's literally paying companies to
*14:25.600- 14:29.520* :  hire people over 60 by offsetting part of their wages.
*14:29.960- 14:33.380* :  The older the employee, the more subsidies a firm receives.
*14:34.140- 14:35.460* :  Got to know men, how can I help you?
*14:36.260- 14:43.180* :  Before retiring, Edna Go worked at UOB, one of Singapore's biggest banks for over 50 years.
*14:43.920- 14:47.040* :  Shortly after stopping work, her husband passed away.
*14:47.480- 14:51.820* :  Now she's back after signing up to a temporary work scheme.
*14:54.900- 15:00.740* :  It means that when projects and part-time vacancies pop up, managers have a ready-made pool
*15:00.740- 15:03.240* :  of experienced workers to draw from.
*15:10.180- 15:18.280* :  By 2026, Singapore's on track to become a super-aged society, which means one in five people
*15:18.680- 15:19.860* :  will be over 65.
*15:19.940- 15:24.140* :  For the government, these types of schemes are a dream solution.
*15:24.720- 15:25.360* :  Nick Marsh.
*15:26.660- 15:32.240* :  It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime around the world crews for three years taking
*15:32.240- 15:35.400* :  in the Maldives, the Seychelles and Madagascar.
*15:35.900- 15:41.020* :  But Belfast, three months, in fact, in the Northern Irish capital, because that's where
*15:41.020- 15:45.120* :  the ship is currently stranded because of problems with its rudders and gearbox.
*15:46.180- 15:52.560* :  Holly Hennessy from Florida is one of the passengers, along with her cat, the aptly named Captain.
*15:53.400- 15:57.520* :  She told my colleague, Nick Robinson, she's never used to umbrella as much in her whole
*15:57.540- 15:57.980* :  life.
*15:58.500- 16:02.440* :  I arrived May 28th and the ship was supposed to depart May 30th.
*16:02.640- 16:03.460* :  Two days.
*16:04.960- 16:06.240* :  So how are you spending your time?
*16:06.700- 16:07.620* :  I've become a local.
*16:08.300- 16:12.660* :  There are about 200 of us who have been in and out of Belfast.
*16:13.120- 16:16.980* :  I, because of Captain the Kitty, I've been stuck here.
*16:17.600- 16:18.960* :  So Belfast has been home.
*16:18.960- 16:23.960* :  I was in an apartment for two months, which meant I would visit your grocery stores and
*16:23.960- 16:25.880* :  your butcher shops and...
*16:25.880- 16:26.580* :  That's a good business.
*16:26.580- 16:32.120* :  But you and Captain have also been living on board as if on a cruise, but just not going
*16:32.280- 16:33.620* :  to...
*16:34.160- 16:34.520* :  Actually, no.
*16:34.520- 16:35.100* :  We're not allowed to stay aboard yet.
*16:35.820- 16:37.720* :  We can spend the days there.
*16:38.160- 16:41.060* :  And the ship is functioning like a normal cruise ship.
*16:41.140- 16:47.880* :  We have entertainment and movies and trivia, and the buffet is open, and the crew is doing
*16:47.880- 16:48.900* :  a magnificent job.
*16:49.060- 16:52.660* :  Holly, why are you miserable, but where are you meant to be now?
*16:53.480- 16:55.600* :  Oh, I'd have to look at my calendar.
*16:56.140- 17:01.800* :  When we left, we were doing Northern Europe, the Fjords, Iceland, Greenland, over to
*17:01.840- 17:02.240* :  Canada.
*17:02.480- 17:07.800* :  Now, because of the delay, it's going to be a Southern itinerary, and we're going to
*17:07.860- 17:11.220* :  cross over to the Azores in Bermuda and then go to the Bahamas.
*17:12.240- 17:13.440* :  Bahamas or Belfast?
*17:13.640- 17:14.200* :  Tricky Joyce?
*17:15.300- 17:15.440* :  Yes.
*17:16.640- 17:16.660* :  Great.
*17:16.660- 17:19.340* :  You seem very good, even about it.
*17:19.700- 17:21.140* :  You're happy to wait, are you?
*17:21.380- 17:24.840* :  Well, it is something I have wanted to do forever.
*17:24.840- 17:27.960* :  The opportunities to actually live at sea.
*17:28.540- 17:30.660* :  You've got months to fail to enjoy it.
*17:31.280- 17:33.840* :  Nick Robinson talking to Holly Hennessy.
*17:36.480- 17:37.220* :  Still to come.
*17:41.260- 17:42.220* :  Tango is our life.
*17:42.220- 17:47.180* :  I left my family and my friends for Tango, and I will continue fighting for Tango.
*17:48.580- 17:52.860* :  Dancing around the clock at the World Tango Festival in Buenos Aires.
*18:01.020- 18:04.020* :  Time Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundredth mid commercial.
*18:04.600- 18:08.880* :  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only
*18:08.880- 18:10.040* :  have to do like four of these.
*18:10.220- 18:13.520* :  I mean, it's unlimited premium wireless for $15 a month.
*18:13.540- 18:16.540* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*18:17.120- 18:18.600* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*18:18.920- 18:23.060* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.
*18:23.420- 18:26.040* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month.
*18:26.040- 18:27.780* :  New customers on first three month plan only.
*18:27.780- 18:28.740* :  Taxes and fees extra.
*18:28.900- 18:30.480* :  Speed slower about 40 gigabyte C.T.
*18:30.480- 18:30.740* :  Tales.
*18:31.200- 18:32.600* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right?
*18:33.500- 18:38.940* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather, and there was a time when he was the biggest
*18:38.940- 18:40.560* :  star in all the world.
*18:41.220- 18:46.220* :  But something happened, not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
*18:46.800- 18:49.700* :  They were forced to leave, forced out.
*18:50.660- 18:56.240* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
*18:56.900- 18:59.920* :  Search for Hollywood Exiles, wherever you get your podcasts.
*19:07.980- 19:11.460* :  Now it's an important decision that could have governments across the world looking closely
*19:11.500- 19:12.940* :  at their climate change policies.
*19:13.500- 19:17.700* :  One of South Korea's highest courts has ruled that the government's plans to reduce greenhouse
*19:17.700- 19:22.440* :  gas emissions are unconstitutional, because they don't properly protect people's rights.
*19:22.440- 19:24.660* :  It's the first of its kind in Asia.
*19:25.500- 19:27.780* :  Mickey Bristow is our Asia Pacific Editor.
*19:28.260- 19:33.720* :  It's quite a complex case this, and the ruling is reasonably technical, but as you indicated
*19:33.720- 19:35.980* :  there, it might have fire-eaching consequences.
*19:36.940- 19:42.680* :  It was brought by about 250 mainly young people, some children, and in fact the lead plaintiff
*19:42.820- 19:48.280* :  was named as an embryo, just to give an indication and idea that climate change is something
*19:48.280- 19:51.720* :  which is going to affect people in the future, not just at the moment.
*19:52.540- 19:59.700* :  The court ruled essentially that South Korea's climate change policies up to 2030 were fine
*20:00.180- 20:01.860* :  and didn't affect people's human rights.
*20:01.860- 20:08.620* :  But after that, when South Korea is moving towards carbon neutrality in 2050, the government
*20:08.620- 20:14.640* :  just hadn't really laid out a detailed enough plan of what it intended to do and how it intended
*20:15.020- 20:16.080* :  to get to that point.
*20:16.660- 20:21.380* :  So essentially by not doing that plan, it had really affected people's human rights and
*20:21.380- 20:23.900* :  hadn't protected and wasn't going to protect people enough.
*20:24.520- 20:26.620* :  Well, what does the ruling mean in practice?
*20:27.220- 20:33.540* :  Well, in practice, the court has given the government until early 2026 to come up with a very
*20:33.540- 20:39.720* :  detailed plan of how it intends to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and already
*20:39.720- 20:44.760* :  the South Korean government has indicated that it will abide by this ruling.
*20:45.340- 20:51.140* :  Also the consequences, the practical consequences, could embolden climate change activists in other
*20:51.140- 20:56.440* :  parts of the world, including East Asia, in order to pursue their own cases, and as you
*20:56.480- 21:00.980* :  indicated there at the beginning, governments could be looking really closely at their climate
*21:00.980- 21:04.320* :  change policies and whether they meet stricter standards.
*21:04.820- 21:05.280* :  Well, indeed.
*21:05.280- 21:08.060* :  I mean, it's the first of its kind in Asia this case.
*21:08.060- 21:11.320* :  Do you think other countries might see similar cases quite soon?
*21:11.500- 21:12.860* :  There are already similar cases.
*21:12.860- 21:17.820* :  Just earlier this year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Switzerland hadn't
*21:17.820- 21:22.360* :  properly protected its people from the effects of climate change.
*21:22.360- 21:27.300* :  There are cases in Taiwan, there's been one in Germany, a couple in America as well.
*21:27.300- 21:32.160* :  So, you know, we've got a lot of these cases, and I think what this court ruling does in
*21:32.160- 21:37.780* :  South Korea is it really get governments to look closely at what they're doing with climate
*21:37.780- 21:44.280* :  change, not be able to say just vague promises and set general goals, but really look at exactly
*21:44.320- 21:45.820* :  how they're going to do this.
*21:45.820- 21:50.420* :  It will focus their attention on how they're going to meet their climate change obligations.
*21:51.120- 21:55.840* :  And as this court in South Korea has shown, there could be consequences if they don't do
*21:55.840- 21:56.060* :  that.
*21:56.500- 21:57.180* :  Mickey Bristo.
*21:58.580- 22:04.420* :  The U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has met China's President Xi Jinping, wrapping
*22:04.420- 22:07.100* :  up three days of talks between Washington and Beijing.
*22:08.140- 22:12.840* :  Tensions between the U.S. and China have been high because of issues such as the war in
*22:12.840- 22:18.340* :  Ukraine, the status of Taiwan, and Beijing's territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
*22:19.180- 22:22.060* :  From Beijing, a China correspondent Laura Bicca reports.
*22:22.700- 22:27.840* :  Jake Sullivan has held 14 hours of meetings over three days in Beijing as both China and
*22:27.840- 22:30.680* :  the U.S. try to manage their substantial differences.
*22:31.240- 22:35.780* :  The tone from each side seemed conciliatory, even though it odds over trade.
*22:36.240- 22:39.260* :  Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the war in Ukraine.
*22:40.000- 22:44.520* :  President Xi told Mr. Sullivan that he hoped the U.S. and China could find the right way
*22:44.720- 22:45.960* :  to get along with each other.
*22:46.640- 22:50.580* :  Mr. Sullivan said there would be a call between the two country's leaders in the next few
*22:50.580- 22:55.660* :  weeks, and he added that they might meet in person one more time before President Biden
*22:55.660- 22:56.740* :  leaves the White House.
*22:57.340- 23:02.940* :  Mr. Sullivan also became the first Biden aide to meet General Zhang Yoxia, one of China's
*23:02.940- 23:08.080* :  top military advisers, a sign that the two sides are taking steps to increase communication
*23:08.080- 23:11.400* :  between their militaries to avoid any potential conflict.
*23:12.080- 23:12.760* :  Laura Bicca.
*23:13.860- 23:19.660* :  Two editors of a news website in Hong Kong have been found guilty of sedition, as the authorities
*23:20.200- 23:21.920* :  continue to target free speech.
*23:22.900- 23:27.920* :  Chungpoi-kun and Patrick Lam said they'd merely reported on key public events.
*23:28.680- 23:29.980* :  Martin Yips sent this report.
*23:30.880- 23:36.540* :  Chungpoi-kun and Patrick Lam were the editors of stand news, a Chinese language website
*23:36.540- 23:40.780* :  which was popular during the pro-democracy protests in 2019.
*23:41.600- 23:47.000* :  During the trial, the prosecution accused Mr. Chung and Mr. Lam of inciting, as they
*23:47.000- 23:52.120* :  put it, hatred or contempt, of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.
*23:52.860- 23:58.340* :  The editors argued that the website was a platform for free speech and defended that
*23:58.340- 24:02.140* :  decision to publish articles critical of the authorities.
*24:02.740- 24:03.600* :  Martin Yip.
*24:05.060- 24:10.000* :  You might think artificial intelligence has no place in a restaurant kitchen, but chefs
*24:10.000- 24:15.480* :  around the world have been using AI to upgrade their menus, with innovative and sometimes
*24:15.480- 24:17.540* :  rather funky flavour pairings.
*24:18.220- 24:24.120* :  But could this be a recipe for disaster, or can AI revolutionise the culinary world?
*24:24.820- 24:28.040* :  Our technology reporter, Paulic Belton, has been investigating.
*24:28.820- 24:33.660* :  I want to see how real restaurant owners who are using generous to AI could have given
*24:33.660- 24:37.020* :  them the edge in making the next big recipe to win over the Michelin Inspector.
*24:37.020- 24:42.120* :  There's this do-do pizza in Dubai that uses it to create a pizza for Dubai with things
*24:42.360- 24:44.020* :  for all of its immigrant cuisine.
*24:44.020- 24:49.240* :  So it's got Arab shawarma chicken, it's got Indian paneer cheese, some things for Filipinos,
*24:49.240- 24:50.480* :  some things for Europeans.
*24:50.920- 24:54.380* :  You've got these large language models that have been able to come up with suggestions
*24:54.380- 24:57.500* :  that for their case that suited their clientele.
*24:58.100- 25:02.380* :  Now it seems that some of the food combinations are quite frankly rather weird.
*25:02.840- 25:07.840* :  Dodo's AI experiment also gave them strawberries and pasta, and I think there's a pizza with
*25:07.980- 25:11.460* :  blueberries and breakfast cereal, which it sounds right up there with what I cook for
*25:11.460- 25:11.880* :  my children.
*25:11.960- 25:17.700* :  There's this lovely taco chain in Texas called Velvet Taco that had AI suggest red curry,
*25:17.700- 25:22.620* :  coconut tofu and pineapple, and the chef said, look, I'm not really sure those things
*25:22.620- 25:24.060* :  are going to be delicious together.
*25:24.060- 25:29.960* :  But I think for restaurants like Do Do in Dubai and Velvet Taco in Dallas, they probably
*25:29.960- 25:31.360* :  also saw a marketing benefit.
*25:31.540- 25:35.200* :  So restaurant girls are talking about generative AI in their daily lives.
*25:35.200- 25:39.300* :  So there's been some marketing hook for them and saying, come on, let AI cook for you.
*25:39.700- 25:46.800* :  Now some of those less than appetizing combinations seem to illustrate the way in which quite frankly
*25:47.320- 25:49.660* :  technology doesn't always get humans.
*25:50.540- 25:54.540* :  Now this is where this paradox which I think is really at the heart of large language
*25:54.540- 25:58.720* :  models like we're all playing with, you know, can it really produce anything that isn't
*25:58.720- 26:00.800* :  either plagiarism or daughter.
*26:01.280- 26:04.960* :  So you know, either you're kind of lifting something off of a recipe blog, maybe without
*26:04.960- 26:08.780* :  giving someone credits, or you're throwing things together just completely randomly,
*26:09.180- 26:10.680* :  putting your cheese and cheery those.
*26:10.720- 26:15.160* :  And maybe the answer for that kind of randomness is that that daughter approaches sometimes
*26:15.160- 26:18.060* :  what you need, that randomness can maybe spur creativity.
*26:18.800- 26:21.440* :  Well, I do think it's worrying though, is if you're making a living coming up with recipes
*26:21.440- 26:26.220* :  and then chat GBT starts offering your recipes except without you getting your tiny cut.
*26:26.480- 26:30.840* :  And I think that also gets at the heart of large language models and problems of intellectual
*26:30.840- 26:33.340* :  property that they haven't quite solved out yet.
*26:33.560- 26:38.360* :  Well, indeed, it could have an impact on food blogging and recipe book writing, couldn't
*26:38.360- 26:38.480* :  it?
*26:38.980- 26:43.180* :  Yes, and I think that people have seen it, you know, I was talking with some recipe bloggers
*26:43.200- 26:47.680* :  who've seen their actual work kind of coming up and another reporting, it maybe alludes
*26:47.680- 26:51.440* :  to how AI is taking people's livelihoods and ways that maybe you haven't expected.
*26:51.660- 26:55.500* :  It's sort of a funny story, you know, kind of Cheerios on pizza, but it gets at some
*26:55.500- 26:59.380* :  quite difficult things about AI and how we'd have to address it as a society.
*26:59.380- 27:02.480* :  You know, on the one hand, it can steal people's ideas, it can steal people's livelihoods,
*27:02.520- 27:04.960* :  but it can also be random and for an engaging.
*27:05.460- 27:06.340* :  Pooric Beltan.
*27:07.400- 27:11.280* :  Let's end this podcast in Argentina, the birthplace of Tango.
*27:11.900- 27:17.200* :  It's loved the world over with many cities following the practice in Buenos Aires of couples
*27:17.200- 27:19.180* :  dancing in the street around the clock.
*27:19.980- 27:25.380* :  And as Wendy Urkart reports, this year's World Tango Festival and Competition in the
