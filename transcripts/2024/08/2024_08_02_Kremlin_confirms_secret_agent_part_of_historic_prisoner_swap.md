*01:02.360- 01:06.960* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*01:06.960- 01:11.640* :  prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you
*01:11.640- 01:16.860* :  talking about? You insane Hollywood ****. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from

*01:35.940- 01:40.660* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the second of August,
*01:40.660- 01:45.300* :  these are our main stories. The Kremlin confirms the convicted assassin
*01:45.300- 01:50.980* :  Vadim Krasnikov released in a huge East-West prisoner swap was a Russian security agent.
*01:51.520- 01:55.560* :  Meanwhile, President Biden and Vice President Harris have welcomed home the Americans
*01:55.560- 02:01.180* :  freed from Russian jails. While the Trump campaign tries to claim credit, hundreds of
*02:01.180- 02:07.600* :  mourners gather in Doha, Qatar to offer funeral prayers for assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Hanir.
*02:07.820- 02:15.960* :  Also in this podcast, we want a change because we can no longer stand this government.
*02:16.040- 02:23.440* :  There is so much misery, so much hunger, so much crime, so much injustice towards innocent people.
*02:23.780- 02:28.780* :  The results of Venezuela's presidential election remain disputed. The U.S. declares the
*02:28.780- 02:34.860* :  opposition have won. Nicholas Maduro says otherwise. We speak to one protest ahead of a nationwide
*02:34.860- 02:43.720* :  mass demonstration on Saturday. It's the morning after the night before in Washington,
*02:43.720- 02:50.020* :  the afternoon after in Moscow and with the prisoner exchange between Russia and the West now
*02:50.020- 02:55.820* :  complete, the talking has begun. One of the three Americans who arrived at Andrews Air Base,
*02:55.820- 03:01.880* :  the former U.S. Marine Paul Wheelan, has been speaking about his sense of relief as his aircraft
*03:01.880- 03:08.720* :  flew him to freedom. So as we came over England and I looked down, that's when it became real.
*03:08.720- 03:14.620* :  We flew over Ireland, then Canada, and into America, and then I knew I was home. So getting
*03:14.620- 03:19.160* :  off the plane, seeing the President, the Vice President, that was nice. It was a good homecoming.
*03:19.180- 03:25.660* :  I went on a two-week vacation. The FSP grabbed me, said I was a spy. I'm apparently a general
*03:25.660- 03:31.120* :  in the Army, a secret agent for DIA. This is the nonsense narrative they came up with.
*03:31.280- 03:37.780* :  They wouldn't let it go. Now this is how Putin runs his government. This is how Putin runs his
*03:37.780- 03:42.900* :  country. In Moscow, the Kremlin has confirmed that Vadim Krasnikov, who was freed as part of the
*03:42.900- 03:49.860* :  deal, was indeed an agent with the FSP Security Service. He was serving a life sentence in Germany
*03:49.860- 03:55.120* :  for murder. I heard more from our Russia editor at BBC Monitoring, Vitaly Shevchenko.
*03:55.600- 04:03.120* :  What happened last night, what happened yesterday, sheds a very rare light onto how these things
*04:03.120- 04:11.520* :  worked. Well, to start with, when Mr Krasnikov was arrested back in 2019, the Kremlin, the very same
*04:12.420- 04:18.680* :  spokesman, Metapyoskov, he said Russia has nothing to do with the crime for which Mr Krasnikov was
*04:18.680- 04:23.900* :  arrested and later convicted the murder. And later today, he said, well, yeah, he's a member of
*04:23.900- 04:32.960* :  the FSP. And also, Demetapyoskov said something really interesting about two children, two miners
*04:32.960- 04:38.900* :  who were released as part of what were sent to Russia as part of the deal. They are the children
*04:38.900- 04:49.000* :  of two Russian agents, spies, convicted in Slovenia. And apparently, they had no idea they were
*04:49.000- 04:54.600* :  Russian until they landed in Moscow. And they don't even speak Russian apparently. And that's why
*04:54.600- 05:00.120* :  President Putin, who met them at the airport last night, he addressed them in Spanish as
*05:00.120- 05:08.740* :  Buenos Notches, good evening. So it's just fascinating insight into the world of spycraft.
*05:09.160- 05:14.960* :  And Vladimir Putin greeted these people, including Mr Krasnikov at the airport.
*05:15.440- 05:20.700* :  Yes, it's extraordinary, given that Mr Krasnikov is a convicted murderer, somebody who
*05:20.700- 05:28.000* :  Vladimir Putin had called previously a patriot. Mr Krasnikov is a, is a prized member of the security
*05:28.000- 05:35.540* :  services. And of course, we shouldn't really be surprised that the state and Vladimir Putin
*05:35.540- 05:42.120* :  personally are happy to see him back. The messages clear to first of all members of Russia's
*05:42.120- 05:48.540* :  security services, that if you get caught, we'll get you out, we'll bring you home. And it's
*05:48.540- 05:57.000* :  a very important message to send, given how many of Russian spies have been exposed and captured
*05:57.000- 06:02.500* :  in the West recently. Vitaly Shevchenko. In the United States, this is an election, yes,
*06:02.500- 06:07.860* :  so things are even more intensely political than usual. No surprise, then perhaps that the
*06:07.860- 06:13.620* :  returning prisoners were greeted as they landed by President Joe Biden and his vice president,
*06:13.620- 06:20.540* :  Kamala Harris. My job is to make sure, number one, they don't get them. They do, we get them back.
*06:21.680- 06:26.140* :  I don't buy this idea that you're not gonna let these people rot in jail.
*06:26.680- 06:34.460* :  I'm very thankful for our president and what he has done with his entire career, but in particular,
*06:34.460- 06:39.500* :  it relates to these families and these individuals, what he has been able to do to bring the allies
*06:39.500- 06:46.800* :  together. This is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a president who
*06:46.800- 06:53.400* :  understands the power of diplomacy. She's the likely Democrat candidate to face Donald Trump.
*06:53.400- 06:58.760* :  Mr. Trump himself said the deal set a bad precedent and suggested the United States had come off
*06:58.760- 07:04.380* :  worse in the exchange. Indeed, his nominee for vice president, J.D. Vance, suggested that Mr.
*07:04.380- 07:09.340* :  Trump himself should get any credit. Look, I think it's great news, at least what little we know,
*07:09.340- 07:12.640* :  we certainly want these Americans to come back home. It was ridiculous that they were in prison
*07:12.640- 07:16.120* :  to begin with, but we have to ask ourselves, why are they coming home? And I think it's because
*07:16.120- 07:20.200* :  bad guys all over the world recognize Donald Trump's about to be back in office so they're
*07:20.200- 07:23.460* :  cleaning house. That's a good thing and I think it's a testament to Donald Trump's strength.
*07:23.800- 07:28.640* :  However, the Democrats will certainly see this as their victory ahead of November's election.
*07:28.640- 07:32.500* :  I heard more from our North America correspondent, Nomiya Ikbal.
*07:32.900- 07:36.880* :  Well, look, I think it's a very good look for President Biden. He has said there's no higher
*07:36.880- 07:41.800* :  priority for him than to bring Americans home safely. It's a very important theme to him,
*07:41.800- 07:46.660* :  bringing our boys and girls home out of harm's way. It's what drove him to withdraw from Afghanistan,
*07:46.660- 07:51.000* :  if you think about it. Of course, there's huge controversy over the way that happened,
*07:51.020- 07:55.680* :  but he can say to the Americans, look, are people at home safe? And when you see those images on
*07:55.680- 08:02.260* :  the tarmac last night of the three former American prisoners back in the US smiling good spirits,
*08:02.260- 08:07.500* :  it's a very primal image that will resonate with a lot of Americans. For the Democratic Party,
*08:07.500- 08:13.400* :  it's seen as a big win at the Republican Party. You're looking for something to criticize with it,
*08:13.400- 08:20.840* :  although they have also, of course, welcomed these Americans home, whether or not this will factor
*08:20.840- 08:24.820* :  into voters' minds. You know, you mentioned it's an election yet. I'm not really sure. It
*08:24.980- 08:30.980* :  certainly gives the Democratic Party and Harris and whoever have VP is a good campaign line,
*08:30.980- 08:36.200* :  but I don't think it will be a deciding factor for those on the fence. We, of course, have some time
*08:36.200- 08:41.960* :  to go before the election, anything can happen. But both sides, we heard that clip from JD Vance,
*08:41.960- 08:48.160* :  using the former prisoners as political footballs already. Yes, it starts with a normal comment
*08:48.160- 08:53.140* :  in which he said it was great that the Americans are back home, but then it went in this completely
*08:53.140- 08:58.980* :  different direction in which Donald Trump seemed to get credit for it. I think he obviously is echoing
*08:58.980- 09:05.520* :  Trump's comments from May, in which Trump said, only he could free Evan Gershkovic and that
*09:05.520- 09:09.980* :  Vladimir Putin will only do it for me, not for anyone else, and we'll be paying nothing,
*09:09.980- 09:16.320* :  but that was all disproved, wasn't it, after the release of Mr. Gershkovic, along with Paul
*09:16.320- 09:22.580* :  Wielin and Alsouk, Kermeshaver, and the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was actually asked
*09:22.580- 09:28.380* :  about Vance's claims at a press conference yesterday, and he dismissed it. He basically said, I don't
*09:28.380- 09:34.940* :  follow. Has there been any criticism that the deal could embolden Moscow to take more prisoners
*09:34.940- 09:39.400* :  in the future? Well, that's certainly the line of the Republicans are going with. Of course,
*09:39.400- 09:44.360* :  the prison swaps are legacy-boost for Biden. You don't often get that for US presidents and foreign
*09:44.360- 09:49.380* :  policy, but there are costs. I mean, Biden didn't get something for nothing. Russians
*09:49.380- 09:55.980* :  convicted of serious crimes were freed, and so for many, the trade-off would seem unjust,
*09:55.980- 10:01.460* :  and we've already seen Republicans such as the House Speaker Mike Johnson and the Senate Minority
*10:01.460- 10:07.320* :  Dimitri McConnell issuing a warning. I mean, they're celebrating the deal between the US, Russia,
*10:07.320- 10:13.080* :  and several other nations, but they're saying that the deal of trading hard and Russian criminals
*10:13.080- 10:17.760* :  for innocent Americans will do very little to discourage Vladimir Putin.
*10:18.800- 10:23.280* :  And on that, thought from Nomiya Ikbal, here's our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*10:24.000- 10:29.880* :  Of course, that fuels concern, that if it's happened now, it's going to happen again, right?
*10:30.160- 10:36.400* :  I remember back in 2022, when Russia and America agreed to a prisoner swap, and Russia released
*10:36.400- 10:41.580* :  Brittany Griner, a US basketball star, who was in a Russian jail for drugs evidences,
*10:42.040- 10:48.240* :  and in return, America released a convicted Russian arms dealer, Victor Boot. And at the time,
*10:48.240- 10:53.580* :  there were critics who said, well, this is just going to encourage Russia to do this again,
*10:53.580- 10:59.660* :  to take more hostages, arrest more Americans in order to trade them for Russians jailed abroad.
*11:00.360- 11:04.720* :  Very soon after that, Evan Gershkovich, though at the Wall Street Journal reporter,
*11:04.720- 11:10.480* :  was arrested on assignment in Yekaterinburg, and for months, Russian officials really haven't
*11:10.480- 11:15.660* :  been hiding the fact that they view Mr. Gershkovich or viewed him as a bargaining chip.
*11:16.380- 11:22.500* :  So, once again, we see a large-scale prisoner swap. And of course, for the friends and the families
*11:22.500- 11:28.860* :  of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, and Al-Sukol Mashaver, and the Russian dissidents who were
*11:28.860- 11:34.040* :  freed from Russian jails, of course, this is a moment for great celebration. But the concern is,
*11:34.460- 11:41.480* :  that the takeaway from this for Moscow will be, okay, hostage diplomacy works, and that means
*11:41.480- 11:46.840* :  that we're probably going to see more of this. In other words, more prisoners in Russian jails,
*11:47.240- 11:50.760* :  foreigners, and Russian citizens, being used as bargaining chips.
*11:51.080- 11:53.300* :  Steve Rosenberg. Now, Tikata.
*12:04.360- 12:09.320* :  Where the funeral of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haneer has been taking place,
*12:09.920- 12:14.560* :  hundreds of mourners gathered at the mosque in the Katari capital Doha for the ceremony.
*12:14.560- 12:19.520* :  Ismail Haneer was killed, along with his bodyguard at a hotel in Iran on Wednesday.
*12:19.520- 12:26.000* :  Israel hasn't commented on what happened, but Hamas and Iran have both said they would retaliate.
*12:26.420- 12:30.060* :  Our correspondent, Al-Agerin Isindo, she sent this report.
*12:30.740- 12:37.800* :  Under a burning sun, crowds streamed to Doha's largest mosque for funeral prayers for the
*12:37.800- 12:45.640* :  slain Hamas leader. To many in the West, he was a terrorist. To many here, he was a defender of
*12:45.640- 12:53.400* :  the Palestinian people. There was grief and plenty of anger towards Israel. They kill us,
*12:53.400- 12:59.600* :  so we will kill them, one man told us. We want revenge. It's human nature.
*13:00.640- 13:06.200* :  The assassination of Ismail Haneer has reverberated around the region and beyond.
*13:07.100- 13:13.800* :  The U.S. President Joe Biden said it was not helpful for achieving a ceasefire in Gaza.
*13:14.700- 13:22.640* :  Haneer was the lead negotiator for Hamas. Palestinian sources say he, more than other Hamas leaders,
*13:23.300- 13:31.000* :  wanted to agree a truce. Now he is dead, and Iran is promising to hit back hard against Israel.
*13:31.840- 13:37.440* :  The Middle East, already near a boiling point, is bracing for what may come next.
*13:38.260- 13:42.680* :  Al-Agerin In Nigeria, several people were shot dead on Thursday,
*13:42.680- 13:47.800* :  at the start of a series of protests against the cost of living. Chanting slogans such as,
*13:47.800- 13:52.500* :  we are hungry, young demonstrators have been taking to the streets in cities across the country.
*13:52.500- 13:58.460* :  The authorities have now imposed a 24-hour curfew in four states in the north to try to prevent
*13:58.460- 14:04.520* :  further unrest. Some major cities appeared calm early on Friday. This protestor in Legos accused
*14:04.520- 14:10.040* :  the government of using force to intimidate people. I can tell you that there is so much of fear
*14:10.040- 14:14.460* :  they are trying to instill in people's faith for coming out to protest today, and that is what
*14:14.460- 14:19.200* :  is going on right now to speak. They are trying to intimidate, they are trying to make people not to
*14:19.200- 14:25.120* :  come out at all, at all. So have the curfews stopped the protests? A question for our reporter
*14:25.120- 14:32.800* :  in Legos, Simi Jola Oshin. They have worked in most states. I've actually just been told that
*14:32.800- 14:38.980* :  in one state, Jugoa, protesters actually came up this morning. They were dispersed by soldiers,
*14:38.980- 14:44.680* :  and that was despite the curfew. But in other states, it has seemed to work. Protesters are
*14:44.680- 14:51.580* :  abiding by the curfew, especially in Cano, which is the country's second-biggest state, and Cano
*14:51.580- 14:57.200* :  saw the largest crowds on the first day of protests. Yesterday, many businesses were shut.
*14:57.200- 15:03.320* :  Protesters set tires of light in front of the House of the State Governor, but it unfortunately ended
*15:03.320- 15:10.420* :  with police firing live bullets and tear gas into the crowd, leading to a confirmed death of
*15:10.740- 15:16.560* :  at least three people. And I know four people were taking to hospital to be treated for injuries.
*15:17.300- 15:24.180* :  And those curfews enforced with a lot of security? Yes, yes. I've been told in many to one
*15:24.180- 15:30.260* :  organizer in one state and in Cano as well, driving around this morning has been very hard. There
*15:30.260- 15:36.180* :  are several checkpoints, as well as soldiers and even military patrolling the streets. And here in
*15:36.180- 15:42.540* :  Lagos, protesters have still come out. There are a couple hundred people in the same area that they
*15:42.540- 15:48.440* :  were protesting yesterday. And again, it's still a very heavy police presence. It's been non-confrontational
*15:48.440- 15:54.660* :  here, but I know it's the same in states in the southeast, in Delta states, as well. People have
*15:54.660- 16:00.420* :  come out. The news of the death yesterday hasn't deterred people from coming out, but also increased
*16:00.420- 16:06.060* :  security presence. And the slogans they're chanting, we are hungry. Well, people have a right to
*16:06.060- 16:11.060* :  eat, don't they? Yes, they certainly do. And that's what they were chanting yesterday when I marched
*16:11.280- 16:16.620* :  alongside the protesters, just observing what they were talking about and what they were saying.
*16:16.620- 16:24.420* :  And I heard many sharing passionate tales of how they've been rationing their food because they
*16:24.420- 16:29.740* :  aren't able to afford what they could before, talking about how they themselves have been
*16:29.740- 16:34.980* :  affected by the economic hardship. They say many Nigerians are facing in the country. They've been
*16:35.400- 16:39.880* :  requesting for the government to do something to reduce the price of fuel and the price of goods
*16:39.880- 16:45.360* :  and food, which has doubled and even tripled in some states over the last year. And this is
*16:45.700- 16:50.180* :  something they said. They're still going to keep protesting about over the next eight days,
*16:50.180- 16:55.520* :  or one person told me he's going to keep coming out as long as he can until he feels like he's
*16:55.520- 17:09.160* :  being heard by the government. If Trump is elected, this will truly be a once-in-a-thousand-year
*17:09.160- 17:15.280* :  opportunity for North Korea. A senior at North Korean de facto says his country is rooting for
*17:15.280- 17:32.640* :  another Donald Trump presidency. He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa.
*17:33.000- 17:38.400* :  Very dark times. People were desperate. We were looking for him. We couldn't find him.
*17:38.440- 17:43.400* :  Nobody knew where he was. Every single one of his victims was black.
*17:44.240- 17:47.020* :  He reached such a state where he was now hunting.

*18:05.560- 18:11.220* :  For 15 months now, Sudan has been gripped in a deadly civil war between the rapid support forces
*18:11.640- 18:16.080* :  and the regular army. On Thursday, the United Nations declared a state of famine
*18:16.080- 18:22.840* :  in the Zamzam refugee camp near the besieged city of El Fasha in North Defeu. And workers
*18:22.840- 18:28.060* :  in Sudan and now warning that the food crisis could worsen if humanitarian conditions
*18:28.060- 18:34.560* :  are not opened in areas affected by conflict. They say Zamzam is particularly short of essential
*18:34.560- 18:40.000* :  supplies, including food and medicine. It hosts half a million displaced people.
*18:40.340- 18:46.560* :  Stefan Dillon oversees medicine San Frontier's emergency response in Sudan. He's been telling my
*18:46.560- 18:51.360* :  colleague Andrew Peach about the problems his group is facing. We are speaking about a very
*18:51.360- 18:56.220* :  sizable population that is in a very difficult situation. We have our supplies cut.
*18:56.980- 19:01.700* :  We can manage, for example, for treating infection, we almost don't have any more
*19:01.700- 19:08.140* :  amoxicillin, so we shift to another antibiotic. In a few weeks, we have to stop some treatments,
*19:08.180- 19:14.980* :  you know, and ration. What we are doing is a truck did not get there. I mean, you need tens
*19:14.980- 19:20.520* :  of trucks every month and we are not there. I mean, we have two trucks we sent six weeks ago
*19:20.520- 19:25.660* :  and there's still blocking cap cabilla. RSF is blocking the supply. So what I mean, what you're
*19:25.660- 19:30.460* :  doing is heroic, but in the end, the situation is just getting worse and worse and worse, because
*19:30.460- 19:36.520* :  the level of response is nowhere near matching the escalation of the problem. Exactly. I mean,
*19:36.520- 19:42.940* :  the situation is very critical in Zamzam and El Fashar. El Fashar is a city under siege. Our
*19:42.940- 19:47.680* :  hospitals have been eating ten times. I mean, the situation is very critical. There is only one
*19:47.680- 19:53.060* :  functioning public hospital that has been eaten last Monday. It's not fully functioning.
*19:53.660- 19:57.580* :  And when you say the rapid support forces are stopping your trucks getting through, are they
*19:57.580- 20:02.260* :  doing that to intentionally cause harm to the people who need the food or are there to have
*20:02.260- 20:08.100* :  security concerns or what's behind them? We don't know. We are constantly negotiating and there is
*20:08.100- 20:13.000* :  always another argument for why the truck are not released. So we are really
*20:13.400- 20:17.680* :  praising for the strike to be released and we are still under negotiation, but we need the
*20:17.680- 20:22.200* :  strike to pass through and we need the strike to reach some time. Staff Ann Dianne from the
*20:22.200- 20:28.320* :  Medical Charity MSF. Venezuela's government says more than a thousand protesters have been
*20:28.320- 20:32.980* :  arrested since demonstrations broke out following the widely disputed results of Sunday's
*20:32.980- 20:38.240* :  presidential election. President Maduro claimed victory for a third term, but the opposition
*20:38.240- 20:43.820* :  have accused him of electoral fraud and many governments around the world have refused to recognize
*20:43.820- 20:48.780* :  the result without proof. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was overwhelming
*20:48.780- 20:54.700* :  evidence the opposition had won. President Maduro has ordered the Supreme Court to take action
*20:54.700- 20:59.700* :  against protesters and called for the opposition leader Maria Machado to be arrested.
*21:00.280- 21:04.760* :  She's gone into hiding and has called for a mass demonstration on Saturday.
*21:08.380- 21:16.040* :  Venezuela won and now it's time to collect. We must remain firm, organized and mobilized with
*21:16.040- 21:21.960* :  the pride of having achieved a historic victory on July 28th and the awareness that to claim victory
*21:21.960- 21:26.460* :  we will go all the way. We will uphold the truth because the world will see the strength
*21:26.460- 21:30.900* :  and determination of a society determined to live in freedom.
*21:31.300- 21:34.280* :  From Caracas is our correspondent Ioni Wells.
*21:37.640- 21:42.060* :  Isabella, not her real name, is one of dozens of families waiting for answers
*21:42.400- 21:44.240* :  outside this police station in Caracas.
*21:51.340- 21:56.000* :  The neighborhood of Caracas began to descend from the mountains from the Pettarez
*21:56.000- 22:00.760* :  long. They started to go down, shouting with pots, pans or flags,
*22:01.460- 22:05.120* :  barefoot children, mothers, current children to the march.
*22:06.260- 22:10.840* :  They are mere paramilitaries of Maduro supporters yell at us,
*22:11.240- 22:16.300* :  curse at us, true stun at us. They told us Viva Maduro.
*22:19.280- 22:24.360* :  We went out to march. We want a change because we can no longer stand this government.
*22:24.360- 22:31.860* :  There is so much misery, so much hunger, so much crime, so much injustice towards innocent people.
*22:36.460- 22:40.820* :  Her son, one of hundreds of people detained in protests against President Maduro.
*22:43.980- 22:49.740* :  The National Guard grabbed my son unjustly because he was not harming anyone.
*22:50.200- 22:55.600* :  My son did not have stones, did not have weapons, he only protested.
*22:56.320- 23:02.980* :  They beat him. They accused him of being a terrorist for defending their country, for wanting a change.
*23:04.140- 23:09.080* :  Isabella cries when she outlines why her family and so many others felt the need to protest.
*23:12.320- 23:17.660* :  We want a future for our children, for our grandchildren, for the entire country.
*23:18.180- 23:21.780* :  There is so much misery, many people eating in the streets,
*23:22.200- 23:24.400* :  many people dying in hospitals.
*23:27.380- 23:34.300* :  I had a granddaughter who died on 6 December last year because there was no oxygen in the hospitals.
*23:34.300- 23:38.940* :  There were 12 children who died because there was no oxygen.
*23:40.140- 23:44.760* :  I won Venezuela to be the same as before, where we work with dignity.
*23:44.760- 23:47.100* :  We earn a decent salary.
*23:47.100- 23:52.160* :  President Maduro has accused the opposition of starting a coup by disputing the election results
*23:52.700- 23:55.340* :  and has denied the electoral fraud they accuse him of.
*23:59.660- 24:04.700* :  This is all directed by a perverse and macabre duo that has to take responsibility.
*24:04.720- 24:10.580* :  Edmondo Gonzalez and Maria Corina Machado, it's not just criminal because of the violence,
*24:10.620- 24:14.400* :  but because they looked for criminals to attack their own people.
*24:16.940- 24:22.400* :  Critics don't want to stop their protest, but the fear of what will happen if they do is growing.
*24:25.820- 24:31.060* :  A senior North Korean defector has told the BBC that the country is hoping Donald Trump
*24:31.060- 24:34.080* :  becomes president, so it can restart negotiations.
*24:34.080- 24:39.720* :  Rihil Gu was working as a diplomat in Cuba when he fled with his family to South Korea
*24:39.720- 24:41.060* :  at the end of last year.
*24:41.500- 24:46.060* :  In his first interview with an international news outlet, he's been speaking to our sole
*24:46.720- 24:47.700* :  correspondent, Jim McKenzie.
*24:53.920- 24:59.180* :  When I meet Mr Rihil, he's accompanied by a bodyguard and two agents from South Korea's
*24:59.180- 25:05.340* :  intelligence service. It's not often such a high ranking official turns their back on the North
*25:05.340- 25:11.980* :  Korean regime. And so as he raced to the airport in the dead of night, giving his family just six
*25:11.980- 25:16.000* :  hours notice. He was making a life or death gamble.
*25:18.760- 25:22.820* :  Most North Koreans who are caught escaping will typically be tortured for a few months,
*25:22.820- 25:28.500* :  then released. But for us elites, there are only two options. Either I'd have been executed,
*25:29.100- 25:33.580* :  or I'd have been sent to a political prison camp for life. I could accept my own death,
*25:33.580- 25:36.660* :  but the fear of my family being killed was overwhelming.
*25:38.680- 25:45.060* :  As a former diplomat, Mr Rihil has a rare insight into what this repressive state wants from
*25:45.060- 25:53.620* :  the rest of the world. This was Kim Jong-un welcoming Vladimir Putin to Pyongyang in June.
*25:54.080- 25:59.620* :  But despite the pair's recent friendship, Mr Rihil tells me that North Korea's ultimate goal
*25:59.860- 26:02.560* :  is still to cut a deal with the United States.
*26:08.000- 26:14.000* :  Although these talks between Trump and Kim broke down in 2019, Pyongyang still sees the
*26:14.060- 26:16.480* :  former president as their best chance of success.
*26:20.020- 26:25.180* :  If Trump is elected, this will truly be a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for North Korea.
*26:25.960- 26:30.780* :  They believe they can negotiate with him and use the personal friendship between Mr Trump and
*26:30.780- 26:32.480* :  Mr Kim to their advantage.
*26:36.280- 26:42.080* :  And they might be right. At a recent rally, the presidential hopeful said he too wanted to
*26:42.200- 26:43.380* :  reignite this friendship.
*26:45.060- 26:50.720* :  When we get back, I get along with him. He'd like to see me back too. I think he misses me if you
*26:50.720- 26:51.440* :  want to know the truth.
*26:52.800- 26:57.120* :  So what is North Korea's strategy when it comes to the United States?
*26:59.740- 27:04.160* :  Mr Rihil tells me that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons. Instead,
*27:04.160- 27:10.400* :  diplomats hope they could convince Trump to lift sanctions in return for freezing their nuclear
*27:10.400- 27:15.700* :  program. But he says Pyongyang would not be negotiating in good faith.
*27:17.480- 27:22.280* :  So if North Korea were to offer to freeze its current arsenal of nuclear weapons and stop
*27:22.300- 27:27.580* :  its nuclear weapons development, you're saying that that would not be the truth.
*27:33.460- 27:37.180* :  The North Korean leader demands total loyalty from his citizens,
*27:37.960- 27:42.900* :  but years of poverty and hunger have chipped away at people. The diplomat says,
*27:44.220- 27:48.420* :  there's no genuine loyalty left. Only forced loyalty.
*27:49.480- 27:54.860* :  Kim Jong-un knows his support is waning. That's why he's intensifying his reign of terror.
*27:56.380- 28:03.240* :  The systems of control are now so strong it is impossible to topple this brutal dictatorship,
*28:03.260- 28:09.880* :  he believes. Change must come slowly, persistently from outside and within.
*28:12.380- 28:17.220* :  Artificial intelligence is no longer the future. It's part of our daily lives.
*28:17.400- 28:23.120* :  So it's no surprise that the leading maker of AI chips and video is one of the world's most
*28:23.120- 28:29.940* :  valuable companies worth more than three trillion dollars. However, the US Department of Justice has
*28:29.940- 28:34.780* :  launched an investigation into the company after complaints from competitors that it's abusing
*28:34.780- 28:40.380* :  its considerable market dominance. The BBC's Pierre Antoine Denis has been following the story.
*28:40.840- 28:46.300* :  The investigators are looking at whether Nvidia pressured cloud providers to buy multiple
*28:46.300- 28:52.200* :  Nvidia products. You have to remember Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the i chip market. So
*28:52.420- 28:58.720* :  the question that the DOJ in the US is trying to figure out is whether Nvidia is now in a position
*28:58.720- 29:05.760* :  to strong arm anyone who wants to get an AI chip to either buy their product or they have to pay
*29:05.760- 29:13.400* :  higher prices and they will not be able to operate as they want. It follows French antitrust
*29:13.400- 29:19.260* :  enforcers that flag the similar practice last months and are preparing to bring charges.
*29:19.260- 29:25.160* :  So lots of positive news around Nvidia in the last few months. Now maybe we're going to be seeing
*29:25.160- 29:29.960* :  Nvidia associated with much more negative headlines in the next few weeks.
*29:30.640- 29:37.580* :  Yeah Antoine Denis. From much maligned garden snails to tool-using octopuses,
*29:37.580- 29:43.520* :  mollusks are among the most diverse animal groups on the planet. Their origins are a mystery.
*29:43.780- 29:50.600* :  Now researchers say a half a billion-year-old fossil of a spiny slug could help shed light
*29:50.940- 29:54.900* :  on what the earliest species looked like. Helen Briggs has the details.
*29:55.740- 30:01.400* :  The shellless, thum-sized creature lived on the sea floor at a time when very early forms of
*30:01.400- 30:06.940* :  most of the major animal groups we know today were starting to appear in the fossil record.
*30:07.560- 30:11.040* :  The researchers, including scientists from the University of Oxford,
*30:11.040- 30:15.440* :  say the fossil resembled a rotting plastic bag on first examination,
*30:15.500- 30:22.380* :  but under the microscope was found to be incredibly rare and special. They say the new fossil,
*30:22.380- 30:29.360* :  called shishania, will help them piece together how animals as different as a squid and an oyster
*30:29.360- 30:35.040* :  evolved from flat shellless slugs covered in a protective spiny armor.
*30:35.600- 30:39.600* :  Mollusks today include some of the best-known animals on the planet
*30:40.120- 30:44.820* :  from tiny garden snails and slugs to colossal squids and octopuses.
*30:45.580- 30:46.360* :  Helen Briggs
*30:49.740- 30:55.760* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*32:20.440- 32:26.020* :  People were desperate. We were looking for him. We couldn't find him and nobody knew where he was.
