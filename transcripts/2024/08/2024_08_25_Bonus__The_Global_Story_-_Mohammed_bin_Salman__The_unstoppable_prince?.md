*01:49.000- 01:52.440* :  Today, the rapid rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
*01:55.180- 02:00.740* :  After ruthlessly ad maneuvering hundreds of rivals, MBS became next in line to the throne
*02:00.780- 02:07.280* :  and the most powerful man in Saudi Arabia. He believes his sweeping vision for the country
*02:07.280- 02:13.480* :  will bring in investment, top flight sport and visitors from around the world. His only
*02:13.480- 02:21.080* :  demand in return. Absolute loyalty. Can anything stop you? Motorkat. Only death.
*02:21.780- 02:26.200* :  So where does he want to take the country and is he truly unstoppable?
*02:29.540- 02:34.980* :  Our guests today, Jonathan Rogben, a journalist and producer of a new two-part documentary that
*02:34.980- 02:40.020* :  tells the story of MBS, the Kingdom, the world's most powerful Prince, hi Jonathan.
*02:41.120- 02:44.960* :  And Sebastian Usher, the BBC's our buffaires editor. Hi Sebastian.
*02:45.300- 02:50.600* :  Hi there. Just how powerful is MBS in Saudi Arabia in 2024?
*02:50.620- 02:53.260* :  Officially, what is his role, Sebastian?
*02:53.580- 02:57.160* :  Well, he's the Crown Prince, so he's the next in line to his father, King Salman.
*02:57.360- 03:02.340* :  And he's also been made the Prime Minister, which I mean, in the system that Saudi Arabia has
*03:02.340- 03:07.820* :  is not the most important, but it gives him an extra kind of credibility. And it's often
*03:07.820- 03:14.300* :  the way that he's referred to by his supporters. I mean, he's essentially de facto ruler of
*03:14.300- 03:20.220* :  Saudi Arabia and has been pretty much for the past gosh, the last six, seven, eight years or so.
*03:20.720- 03:26.460* :  I mean, although it wasn't formalized into something, it still isn't quite when foreign leaders
*03:26.860- 03:32.640* :  go to Saudi Arabia now. They very much do go to meet him. I mean, he is the man who calls for
*03:32.640- 03:35.460* :  the shots in Saudi Arabia, so yes, his power is immense.
*03:36.080- 03:41.380* :  And Sebastian, although Saudi Arabia is a monarchy, it doesn't work strictly in the same way as
*03:41.380- 03:48.460* :  many monarchies that were familiar with work, does it? No, I mean, the system that evolved after
*03:49.020- 03:55.040* :  that even sailed the founder of the modern Saudi. I mean, it did go down to his son,
*03:55.100- 04:02.040* :  King Sal was the first son after he died, but since then, it was his brothers who succeeded him,
*04:02.040- 04:06.900* :  and it was essentially a succession system in which the older brother was supposed to be the next
*04:06.900- 04:12.580* :  one. These were being the sons of him and Sal, of course, he had more than 40 officially recognized
*04:12.580- 04:19.200* :  sons. And, you know, although it went to the older brother, there were changes within that,
*04:19.260- 04:23.640* :  where some brothers were essentially stepped over because they weren't seen as up to the job.
*04:24.340- 04:31.020* :  So it's a system which wasn't really formalized in any way, but it didn't involve the direct
*04:31.020- 04:37.180* :  succession of the sons of the current King, and that successor would move into position as Crown
*04:37.180- 04:42.320* :  Prince, essentially that's the position from which it's expected that the next King would come.
*04:43.120- 04:48.260* :  And Jonathan, if we're trying to understand that power, and just who Muhammad bin Salman is,
*04:49.000- 04:55.340* :  you've been reporting on his rise to power, help us understand just how rapid or how unexpected
*04:55.420- 05:00.740* :  that was. Take us back to where it all began, where he was born, his position in the royal family.
*05:01.320- 05:06.900* :  He really is the kid least likely to succeed if you go back and look at the history of
*05:07.220- 05:14.320* :  Muhammad bin Salman or MBS. In the sense that he had several brothers, many of whom were quite
*05:14.320- 05:21.460* :  distinguished. One was the First Muslim to become a NASA astronaut. Another got a PhD from Oxford
*05:21.460- 05:28.060* :  University, and MBS didn't leave the kingdom. He was educated at home. By all accounts, he
*05:28.060- 05:35.620* :  wasn't a keen student. He preferred playing with the palace guards, but he emerged as his father's
*05:35.620- 05:42.440* :  favorite. And what happened was that two previous Crown princes died in quick succession in 2011 and
*05:42.740- 05:50.500* :  2012. And suddenly Prince Salman, MBS's father, becomes the next Crown Prince and therefore the
*05:50.500- 05:58.940* :  most likely next heir. And he looks around at his sons, and he chooses MBS over the other
*05:58.940- 06:05.560* :  brothers to be the one who is going to help him. His father is not only Crown Prince, but also
*06:05.560- 06:11.440* :  Defence Minister, and MBS is constantly at his side. And MBS, I mean, it's interesting to think
*06:11.440- 06:17.900* :  about why he chose MBS, possibly because he reminded him of himself as a kind of rather
*06:18.580- 06:25.280* :  rough-earned warrior like figure, perhaps a bit of a throwback to the founder of the modern kingdom
*06:25.280- 06:34.300* :  of Saudi Arabia. But also he's a grafter. He works hard. He's keen to learn. And in a kingdom where
*06:34.300- 06:41.020* :  many thousands of princes are accused of being pampered playboys, this is a young man who's really,
*06:41.020- 06:47.300* :  really on the make and determined that his father should become king and that he should become
*06:47.300- 06:52.860* :  king one day himself. And speaking of that evolution, Jonathan, you've been speaking to people who
*06:52.860- 06:58.660* :  claim that MBS went to quite extraordinary lengths to ensure that the Crown would pass to his father
*06:58.660- 07:04.840* :  in coming in his own direction then, even targeting one of his uncles. Yes, that's right. I mean,
*07:04.840- 07:10.620* :  the sad fact is that King Salman who's now in his mid to late 80s is suffering from what's
*07:10.620- 07:20.680* :  believed to be a form of dementia. And in 2014, we heard from a very good source that MBS was so
*07:20.680- 07:26.540* :  worried that his father's illness would become too obvious that his father would not be allowed
*07:26.540- 07:33.880* :  to become king. I wasn't the ministry that night. The office of Muhammad Vinayf called me and said,
*07:33.880- 07:41.200* :  don't leave. There is a CD you need to watch. The source we spoke to is a man called Sad Al Jabri
*07:41.200- 07:48.560* :  who was the chief of staff for the Saudi interior minister. He's the most senior Saudi
*07:48.560- 07:57.080* :  dissident to have spoken about the inner workings of MBS's royal court. And he told us that he had
*07:57.080- 08:03.760* :  a video recording that he had seen because there's a lot of internal spying that goes on between
*08:03.760- 08:11.620* :  different factions, different princes. He had this video recording of MBS and a man called MBN,
*08:11.620- 08:18.820* :  Muhammad Vinayf, who was the interior minister at the time. MBS is sitting with Prince Hamid Vinayf
*08:18.880- 08:27.760* :  in his office. He was tense. He told him that's a ring, a poisoning ring. He had this poison
*08:27.760- 08:34.520* :  ring in order to poison the monarch at the time so that his father could take over.
*08:35.520- 08:41.860* :  It's enough to kill the guy if we just shake hand with him and I'm I'm willing to go to the king
*08:41.860- 08:47.300* :  and shake the hand with him. I must say here that's I don't know for sure whether he's
*08:47.300- 08:53.240* :  was serious or just bragging that's our showing off in the front of his cousin but we talk it
*08:53.740- 09:00.180* :  seriously. It was taken seriously enough for MBS to be banned from court for a while and to
*09:00.180- 09:08.580* :  be prevented from shaking hands with the king his own uncle. And I think it's just a story one
*09:08.580- 09:17.700* :  of many stories which demonstrates the extraordinary rampant and dangerous ambition that MBS has
*09:17.700- 09:25.560* :  at every turn both to take power and ultimately to keep it. And even once his father had become
*09:25.560- 09:31.240* :  crown prince and next in line to the throne it's still as we've been discussing that evolution
*09:31.240- 09:38.340* :  wasn't certain that MBS himself would automatically follow on. Your reporting shows that major global
*09:38.340- 09:45.180* :  events were influenced by him trying to build out his own reputation, his own platform, the war
*09:45.180- 09:52.280* :  in Yemen being a case in point. Yes, I mean in 2015 his father becomes king. MBS is
*09:52.280- 10:00.300* :  defense minister. He's just 29 years old. He has no military experience. And what does he do?
*10:00.300- 10:07.180* :  A couple of months into his father's reign he leads a coalition, a Gulf coalition into war
*10:07.180- 10:15.040* :  against the Houthis in Yemen who have usurped the UN recognized leader of the country.
*10:19.020- 10:25.300* :  And this is quickly and widely decried as a complete disaster and it's currently a ceasefire
*10:25.300- 10:30.440* :  between the Houthis in Yemen and Saudi Arabia but not before hundreds of thousands of people
*10:30.440- 10:36.880* :  haven't died or been killed. And this was really the first big mistake that MBS made.
*10:37.360- 10:46.520* :  We started the war in March and MBS was pushing towards ground intervention. MBN was crown prince
*10:46.520- 10:55.160* :  he said no. Sad al-Jabri who was the chief of staff of the interior minister told us MBS had
*10:55.160- 11:01.580* :  forged his father the king's signature in order to authorize the use of ground troops.
*11:02.440- 11:09.280* :  We heard from some people around the MBS that he forged a signature of his dad for that royal
*11:09.280- 11:15.780* :  decree. And this revelation we didn't know that this was the case. Later on we were surprised that
*11:15.780- 11:23.380* :  there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions. Now it's important to say that
*11:23.380- 11:30.060* :  ground troops weren't the decisive factor in the Yemen war and that the Saudis who hadn't
*11:30.060- 11:34.980* :  responded to our request for answers to some of these allegations. But what I would say on
*11:34.980- 11:41.360* :  their behalf I think is that they would deny it. They would say that the king wrote his own
*11:41.360- 11:47.760* :  official decrees and that MBS would not have done that. And it's interesting the point you make
*11:47.760- 11:53.720* :  about whether it impacted MBS reputation or not because there was that point Jonathan where
*11:53.720- 11:59.700* :  his father had to decide whether to pass the crown to his son or to his cousin Muhammad bin Nayef.
*12:00.180- 12:05.680* :  And Donald Trump's administration actually played a role in helping MBS to build out his stature
*12:05.680- 12:11.000* :  his position at that time. Tell us about that. Well I think with the benefit of hindsight we should
*12:11.000- 12:17.180* :  have all seen that MBS was the once and future king. But a lot of Arab watches, a lot of Saudi
*12:17.180- 12:24.300* :  watches did get it wrong. They assumed that the crown prince at the time Muhammad bin Nayef would
*12:24.960- 12:33.940* :  succeed king Salman and Muhammad bin Nayef was a key friend of the CIA and MI6 in combatting
*12:34.420- 12:39.880* :  Al-Qaeda terrorist plots. He helped save hundreds if not thousands of lives in the West.
*12:40.660- 12:46.260* :  So this guy was very much the MI6 and CIA's man and they wanted him to become king.
*12:52.280- 12:58.640* :  But instead in the summer of 2017 he was invited to a meeting with MBS.
*12:59.660- 13:05.800* :  His phone was taken away from him his guards were dismissed and he was in a room and there was
*13:05.800- 13:12.960* :  someone in that room who was trying to convince him that he had to willingly give up the crown
*13:12.960- 13:20.000* :  prince ship. We spoke to professor Bernad Haiko who teaches at Princeton in the US and he's a friend
*13:20.000- 13:26.780* :  of MBS. Muhammad bin Nayef his rival of the previous crown prince was was known to be addicted to
*13:26.780- 13:33.280* :  pain killing drugs because he had been badly injured in an Al-Qaeda attack. He was effectively
*13:33.280- 13:40.620* :  told if he didn't do this willingly there would be consequences to him and he could do this either
*13:41.180- 13:48.400* :  through a formal way or it could be done in a way that would be again deeply troubling an embarrassing
*13:52.960- 13:57.920* :  frame. And I guess the point about Donald Trump in all this is that in the meantime while this
*13:57.920- 14:04.380* :  was all going on Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner had become friends with MBS and it was
*14:04.380- 14:10.620* :  like one prince laying from one dynastic family talking to another so they would play video games
*14:10.620- 14:17.660* :  together they would swap each other so essentially everything that MBS did was unofficially
*14:17.820- 14:25.120* :  underwritten by the Trump administration and Muhammad bin Nayef was arrested he has not
*14:25.680- 14:31.660* :  been heard from for several years and remember this was the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and this
*14:31.660- 14:40.620* :  sets a pattern I think of MBS systematically shutting down all avenues of opposition and instead
*14:40.620- 14:47.860* :  what MBS has done is forged a new constituency of his own amongst young people in Saudi Arabia
*14:48.460- 14:55.560* :  by giving them access to cinemas and concerts and the freedom to men and women to mingle together.
*14:56.380- 15:01.920* :  So Sebastian when we put all those pieces of the puzzle together and we're looking at the image
*15:01.920- 15:09.000* :  of Muhammad bin Salman who is he what does it tell us? I think the defining image still for many
*15:09.480- 15:16.080* :  he is seen as a man not only who could use these incredibly strong armed tactics against
*15:16.300- 15:25.120* :  his potential opponents but if you talk to people here about Saudi Arabia many people you know
*15:25.120- 15:30.900* :  in the US and around that's how they see it still as a kind of umpariate state but when you're
*15:30.900- 15:38.200* :  there in Saudi Arabia I mean I lived there for a time in the 90s it is like day and night how it is
*15:38.200- 15:44.720* :  now to how it was then then the morality police were on the streets they were controlling the way
*15:44.720- 15:51.280* :  people dressed the way they communicated with each other the division between men and women all
*15:51.280- 15:58.200* :  of these stretches on the way that people could live the ban on women driving for example being one
*15:58.200- 16:07.260* :  of them these have been turned around and the power of the very strict clerical establishment
*16:08.140- 16:15.800* :  has been almost entirely taken away from them it is a real change you see it when you walk the
*16:15.840- 16:21.040* :  streets of Saudi Arabia when you go anywhere and the way for example that men and women interact
*16:21.040- 16:28.400* :  now to me is extraordinary having experienced it you know 15 20 years ago when the taboos were so
*16:28.400- 16:36.480* :  strong to see how easily it seems this new generation to live in a way that was completely alien to
*16:36.480- 16:43.440* :  their parents many of them have a very strong respect for MBS they see him as someone who's
*16:43.440- 16:49.480* :  prioritized their generation their needs and their desires because I mean what he's trying to do to
*16:49.480- 16:55.460* :  an extent he wants to find a way to wean the economy of oil so you know through the tourism sector
*16:55.460- 17:02.520* :  through all sorts of other new ways of of making money for the Saudis obviously what he hasn't done
*17:02.520- 17:08.480* :  is give them any political space whatsoever independently to navigate down there and there
*17:08.480- 17:14.360* :  are still extraordinary prison sentences given to people who are seen as stepping out of line
*17:14.360- 17:20.840* :  in even the slightest way so Sebastian you're you're outlining there this vision that MBS has for
*17:20.840- 17:26.620* :  Saudi Arabia the economy and so on so ladies and gentlemen we move to the Leonardo da Vinci the
*17:26.620- 17:32.280* :  Salvatore Mundi Jonathan nothing quite gives insight into the ambition that he has for the country
*17:32.280- 17:38.940* :  than that purchase of painting the Salvador Mundi at three hundred and seventy million dollars
*17:38.940- 17:46.680* :  four hundred four hundred million yes the story goes like this in 2017 a Saudi prince
*17:47.800- 17:50.740* :  biz and astonishing four hundred and fifty million dollars
*17:52.540- 17:59.280* :  for a painting called the Salvatore Mundi at a Christie's auction house in New York it's the most
*17:59.280- 18:07.220* :  expensive work of art ever sold and nobody has seen this painting ever since so not for seven
*18:07.220- 18:15.320* :  years and we spoke to a friend of the crown prince professor Bernad Haikl and he told us that the
*18:15.320- 18:23.360* :  painting was in storage in Geneva and he confirmed that it had been bought on behalf of MBS himself
*18:24.120- 18:28.400* :  when I asked about it MBS said do you know how many people visit Dulouvre I said
*18:28.400- 18:34.220* :  tens of millions in Paris he says do you know that ninety percent visit Dulouvre just to see one
*18:34.220- 18:38.900* :  object and do you know what that object is I said well it's probably the Mona Lisa right he said
*18:38.900- 18:47.220* :  yeah that's right and he quoted MBS as saying that the painting would be displayed in rear at the
*18:47.220- 18:54.240* :  capital so he said I want to build a very large museum in rear and I want an anchor object that
*18:54.240- 18:59.860* :  will attract people just like the Mona Lisa I think it speaks to his ambition to play the
*18:59.860- 19:07.820* :  West at its own game really in in conspicuous displays of power which will in MBS's mind turn
*19:07.820- 19:14.640* :  Saudi Arabia into a major tourist destination so we've seen the purchase of Newcastle united in
*19:14.640- 19:21.200* :  the Premier League Cristiano Ronaldo playing his soccer in Saudi Arabia for hundreds of millions
*19:21.200- 19:28.280* :  of dollars a year I'm not sure he really cares that much about what people think in the West of him
*19:28.840- 19:35.740* :  I think he's much more interested in portraying his own power actually doing the opposite of sports
*19:35.740- 19:41.380* :  washing and actually saying to the rest of the world you can say what you like about me but I've

*21:42.060- 21:51.800* :  story each weekday so I'm joined today by Jonathan Rugman and Sebastian Usher alongside those headlines
*21:51.800- 21:57.160* :  that we've been discussing that MBS might have welcomed the effort he's making for the country
*21:57.820- 22:00.160* :  there are more troubling stories linked to his regime
*22:02.920- 22:09.660* :  I opened my my phone and checked the consulate the working time and it was saying that
*22:10.440- 22:17.020* :  the consulate already closed in october 2018 journalist Jamal Hashadji entered the Saudi
*22:17.020- 22:23.420* :  consulate in Istanbul and was never seen alive again this was his fiancee speaking to the BBC
*22:24.400- 22:30.640* :  and then I called the consulate he said there is no one inside and then I got really scared
*22:31.620- 22:37.040* :  where is Jamal what happened to Jamal despite attempts by the Saudi government to cover it up we now
*22:37.040- 22:43.780* :  know that he was murdered in the consulate and amid international outcry MBS was forced to acknowledge
*22:43.780- 22:54.820* :  the incident did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi absolutely not this was a heinous cry
*22:55.500- 23:01.880* :  but I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia and what's incredible from your
*23:01.880- 23:08.680* :  reporting Jonathan is that this may not have been the only attempted assassination yes that's
*23:08.680- 23:17.180* :  right we spoke to Saad al-Jabri who's the most senior Saudi dissident to have fled the kingdom and
*23:17.200- 23:23.880* :  to have been prepared to speak to us and he has alleged in court documents that two weeks
*23:24.580- 23:31.300* :  after the murder of Jamal Hashoggi in Istanbul another Saudi hit squad was deployed to Canada
*23:31.300- 23:39.340* :  and an attempt either to kill or or to bring him back to Saudi Arabia he planned for my assassination
*23:39.420- 23:47.540* :  there is no question about the motive MBS says it sees me as a threat to him and he will not rest
*23:47.540- 23:54.220* :  off until he sees me dead and the Canadians are certainly not denied that this happened as far as
*23:54.220- 24:01.200* :  we know the hit squad was turned back does he live in fear of something similar being repeated
*24:02.180- 24:10.000* :  yes he does I met him in three countries I spent a lot of time with him trying to build up his
*24:10.000- 24:17.380* :  confidence to to talk about what he knows and what he knows is a great deal two of his children
*24:17.380- 24:23.620* :  are being held against their will in Saudi Arabia they're not allowed to join him in Canada
*24:23.880- 24:29.340* :  and he believes that they're being held in some sort of insurance policy to try and prevent him
*24:29.340- 24:37.420* :  from speaking out any further but yes he is convinced that MBS is going to try and kill him
*24:38.080- 24:43.580* :  let's talk about that international side of things for a moment Sebastian what has been the impact
*24:43.580- 24:49.660* :  of the events we've been discussing the death of Jamal Hashoggi the crackdown on internal dissent
*24:50.340- 24:56.540* :  you know as we've been saying it's still very much colors the image of not just MBS but I
*24:56.540- 25:04.780* :  think of Saudi Arabia itself Saudi Arabia has made clear under MBS that yes it's still a close
*25:04.780- 25:13.000* :  ally of the US but that it will also cozy up to China to Russia to whatever essentially MBS
*25:13.780- 25:18.980* :  and the people who advise him feel is in the interest of Saudi Arabia it is in a very very
*25:18.980- 25:25.880* :  strong position where it's needed in order for the world economy to continue particularly with
*25:25.880- 25:32.620* :  the Israeli Palestinian conflict I think the world I think the US are looking to Saudi Arabia
*25:32.780- 25:41.560* :  to be the power in the Arab world that may when and if the war in Gaza ends to be trying to secure
*25:42.160- 25:49.060* :  some sort of future that is livable for the Palestinians and I guess for the Israelis too
*25:54.640- 26:00.060* :  so MBS has become the most powerful man in Saudi Arabia and embarked on reshaping the country
*26:00.060- 26:05.660* :  in this bold new vision as we've been discussing Jonathan the investigative journalist Karim Zidane told
*26:05.660- 26:08.900* :  you that this formed the basis of a new social contract
*26:13.580- 26:20.760* :  the social contract says this I'm going to give you everything you have always desired all I ask
*26:20.760- 26:26.800* :  from you is that you never mentioned politics you never criticized me or what I am doing
*26:28.240- 26:34.060* :  but what is standing in his way how secure is that social contract does he face any challenges at
*26:34.780- 26:40.820* :  well Saudi Arabia will remain an absolute monarchy as it always has been for the foreseeable future
*26:41.540- 26:49.420* :  I think the lesson from the Arab Spring revolutions that began in 2011 is that democracy can be a
*26:49.420- 26:56.820* :  very dangerous thing and the Saudi royal family will do all it can to prevent it from coming to Saudi
*26:56.820- 27:04.380* :  Arabia MBS has very successfully brought to heel those who might criticize him and so the clerics
*27:04.700- 27:09.780* :  don't speak out the business elite don't speak out after hundreds of them were locked in the
*27:09.780- 27:16.240* :  risk cart and hotel his fellow princes don't speak out they've either been paid large sums of
*27:16.240- 27:22.240* :  money to keep quiet or some of them have been placed under house arrest so he has this extraordinary
*27:22.240- 27:29.860* :  degree of consolidated power I think the biggest threat he faces is the risk of assassination
*27:30.780- 27:37.900* :  because he is made an enormous number of enemies on his way to the top we've spoken about how
*27:37.900- 27:44.340* :  the risk to him is potential assassination and in his own words he has said that only death
*27:44.340- 27:50.640* :  could stop him he's a young man as we've said just 38 potentially has decades of rule ahead of him
*27:51.300- 27:57.840* :  how significant could his rule his vision for Saudi Arabia be for the world Sebastian do you
*27:57.840- 28:05.200* :  want to take that first I mean it's significant in terms that Saudi Arabia has been perhaps the
*28:05.440- 28:11.920* :  major player in the Middle East for some time now and that is likely to continue I mean whether
*28:11.920- 28:18.140* :  he has beyond Saudi Arabia itself really an ideology I mean this is what used to be the case with
*28:18.140- 28:24.980* :  Saudi Arabia I mean the Wahhabi very strict Islamic ideology was exported to many countries that
*28:24.980- 28:30.840* :  certainly isn't going to happen under him so in some senses you know the Saudi effect on the
*28:30.840- 28:37.640* :  rest of the world might be slightly less in that way but within the region as far as most
*28:38.060- 28:42.640* :  Arab countries are concerned they need to take Saudi Arabia into account and what it wants
*28:43.460- 28:48.960* :  that's going to continue I mean the relationship in the wider world I think is going to be
*28:49.680- 28:54.280* :  as we've seen not just with Saudi Arabia but but with other countries of a similar kind which are
*28:54.600- 29:00.440* :  becoming more and more confident in a sense in themselves politically socially and economically
*29:00.500- 29:08.800* :  that Saudi Arabia will carve a way for itself making deals making agreements working politically
*29:09.580- 29:15.760* :  with what the U.S. sees as its enemies Russia in particular its economic competitors China
*29:16.600- 29:25.400* :  as things stand MBS clearly has no concern really about riling the U.S. over this and I think
*29:26.000- 29:29.940* :  you know that's something that we are going to continue to see Jonathan what do you think?
*29:30.160- 29:37.640* :  Well I think in 10 years time MBS is hoping when he hosts the World Cup and his country is the only
*29:37.640- 29:46.640* :  bidder for the 2034 World Cup it will be a coming out party for his brand of nationalism and for
*29:46.640- 29:53.940* :  Saudi Arabia having finally taken its place its rightful place on the world stage as a major power
*29:54.620- 30:03.480* :  it's already a G20 country it's a big economy MBS has socially if not politically liberalized
*30:03.980- 30:11.520* :  Saudi Arabia he's made the country a far less stifling place to live but at the same time I think he
*30:11.520- 30:18.460* :  will be up there with President Xi of China and Putin in Russia and Erdogan in Turkey as this
*30:19.440- 30:26.580* :  die hard economic nationalist but of course he's from a new generation he's still a young man and he'll
*30:27.500- 30:34.360* :  be likely ruling Saudi Arabia much longer than those other leaders so we better get used to him
*30:34.940- 30:41.980* :  I think the danger is that he is still unpredictable he still has a tendency to act on impulse
*30:42.680- 30:48.180* :  whether cooler heads now prevail around him to stop him from making any more mistakes
*30:48.740- 30:54.460* :  A plenty to think about there thanks to you both for bringing that reporting to us here on the global
