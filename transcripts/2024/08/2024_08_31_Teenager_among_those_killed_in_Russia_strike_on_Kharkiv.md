*01:28.760- 01:31.480* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:33.940- 01:38.800* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Saturday, the 31st of August, these are our main stories.
*01:39.420- 01:44.960* :  Ukrainian officials say a Russian-era attack has killed at least seven people in Harkiv.
*01:45.600- 01:51.100* :  Moscow has pulled part of its paramilitary force out of Bikina Faso to help defend Russia's
*01:51.100- 01:56.220* :  curse region from a Ukrainian offensive. Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered the immediate
*01:56.860- 01:59.800* :  suspension of the social media platform X in the country.
*02:01.740- 02:07.820* :  Also in this podcast, we had to launch a rocket, and it went up to an altitude of about
*02:07.820- 02:13.880* :  760 kilometers, and had a suite of instruments on board, and they were measuring the electric field.
*02:14.700- 02:18.560* :  Finally, proof that the Earth has its own electric field. So, what does it do?
*02:22.120- 02:28.380* :  We begin in Ukraine. Officials in the country's second city Harkiv say at least seven people were
*02:28.380- 02:33.580* :  killed and dozens hurt on Friday in Russian strikes, including a guided bomb attack.
*02:34.360- 02:39.040* :  The victims include a teenage girl in a playground and people in a nearby apartment block.
*02:43.200- 02:48.720* :  Each day, residents of Harkiv can only guess who and what will be Moscow's next target.
*02:49.040- 02:53.840* :  This time, Russian glide bombs killed residents living in a 12-story apartment block
*02:53.840- 02:59.940* :  and a 14-year-old girl in a playground. Glide bombs are not as precise as cruise missiles or
*02:59.940- 03:05.520* :  ballistic rockets. Their purpose is to cause devastation. And this is exactly what the Kremlin
*03:05.520- 03:11.080* :  wants to achieve, Kyiv says. President Zelensky responded to this attack by once again calling
*03:11.080- 03:17.200* :  on Ukraine's allies to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons to attack Russian territories.
*03:17.820- 03:24.060* :  Meanwhile, President Zelensky has dismissed the commander of the Air Force after one of the F-16
*03:24.060- 03:29.640* :  fighter jets donated by its NATO allies crashed on Monday. The pilot of the plane was killed.
*03:29.640- 03:35.700* :  The F-16 was being used during an operation to repel Russian missile attacks. The cause of the
*03:35.700- 03:40.260* :  crash is unknown. In a video message, Mr. Zelensky said he made the decision to replace
*03:40.260- 03:44.960* :  my caller Oleshtuk in order to strengthen his country's military leadership.
*03:47.900- 03:53.000* :  I've decided to replace the commander of the Air Force of Ukraine. I'm immensely grateful to all
*03:53.000- 03:58.300* :  our pilots, engineers, and all our Air Defense personnel to everyone who's truly fighting for
*03:58.300- 04:04.220* :  Ukraine for results. And this is just as necessary at the command level. We must strengthen ourselves
*04:04.220- 04:08.300* :  and protect our people. Protect the personnel. Protect all our warriors.
*04:08.740- 04:15.940* :  Well, the pilot killed in the incident was named as Alexey Mez with the call sign Moonfish. He was
*04:15.940- 04:22.040* :  one of the first few Ukrainian pilots trained to fly advanced fighter jets. Ben Brown spoke to Adam
*04:22.040- 04:27.920* :  Mekos, co-founder of the Wingman for Ukraine campaign group who worked alongside the pilot.
*04:28.420- 04:33.920* :  So what does he know about the crash? That morning, Russia had launched one of its largest aerial
*04:33.920- 04:41.140* :  attacks, flinging cruise missiles and she had drones at Kiev and other places. And so around seven
*04:41.140- 04:46.540* :  o'clock in the morning, this attack took place. Moonfish was up there shooting down these things.
*04:46.540- 04:52.840* :  It is believed that he shot down three Russian cruise missiles as well as one of the Iranian
*04:52.860- 04:58.380* :  built drones, the shaheads, which has been very difficult to do to date with a prior aircraft
*04:58.380- 05:04.800* :  that Ukraine was using, the MiG-29s in SU-27s, the old Soviet stuff. They weren't able to do it at this
*05:04.800- 05:10.160* :  level. So he knocked down four air-to-air victories in that mission and a week before he had knocked
*05:10.160- 05:15.140* :  down another shahead. So technically, this young man on the day of his death, he became an ace.
*05:15.320- 05:20.720* :  It's very early days to speculate, but President Zelensky sacking the commander of the Ukraine in
*05:20.720- 05:26.460* :  Air Force. He wondered why. It's such a catastrophic loss in so many ways because he was such a fine
*05:26.460- 05:31.900* :  human being. He was, of course, the leader of the F-16 squadron that had been trained overseas
*05:31.900- 05:37.380* :  and brought into Ukraine. And so all the guys, that's really, I think, the hardest part to take.
*05:37.380- 05:43.640* :  Why Moonfish? Moonfish had trained in 2019 with the California Air National Guard. So he spoke
*05:43.640- 05:48.360* :  excellent English. He had flown with American pilots. And then he undertook this incredible mission.
*05:48.540- 05:52.340* :  He was trying to get the message out to the Western world that they needed these modern jets.
*05:52.340- 05:57.800* :  And I told him and his friend, Jews, these two MiG-29 pilots, I said, guys, you've got to come to
*05:57.800- 06:02.240* :  Washington if you're to do that. You've got to look them in the eyes. And so Moonfish and Jews
*06:02.240- 06:08.280* :  left the front lines. They flew to Washington, DC, and we put them in front of eight of the most
*06:08.280- 06:12.700* :  powerful US senators. And these young men went in there and they made their case. And it's an
*06:12.700- 06:17.460* :  incredible story because as soon as they walked in, one of the firebrands said to them, you guys
*06:17.460- 06:22.000* :  have come a long way, but you know you're not getting F-16s. And that would rattle a lot of people.
*06:22.340- 06:26.920* :  But Moonfish and Jews, they hung in there and they made their case. And by the time that meeting
*06:26.920- 06:31.140* :  was over, that same sender, when he pulled up to them, when they were leaving, he lowered the
*06:31.140- 06:35.580* :  window of his car and he said, God bless you guys. I know you're going back into combat next week.
*06:35.580- 06:39.060* :  And we're going to have something for you. A year later, the F-16s came to Ukraine.
*06:39.340- 06:41.580* :  How important are the F-16s to Ukraine?
*06:41.580- 06:46.600* :  Well, I think we saw in August 26th what Alexey was doing, what Moonfish was doing. He was saving
*06:46.600- 06:52.040* :  the civilians on the ground. Every missile he shot down, every drone was some little kid who
*06:52.040- 06:56.840* :  was not going to wake up with a rubble over him or lose his parents. I mean, he was fighting for
*06:56.840- 07:01.880* :  his people. And so it's a tragedy, but he went out of hero. And I think people will always remember
*07:01.880- 07:08.260* :  him for that. That was Adam Mekos. The head of a Russian paramilitary force deployed to
*07:08.260- 07:13.540* :  Bikina Faso, says troops have been pulled out of the country in order to defend Russia's
*07:13.540- 07:19.140* :  Kursk region. This follows an incursion there by Ukrainian forces. In May, the so-called
*07:19.340- 07:23.680* :  Bear Brigade, which is linked to Russia's defense ministry, was deployed to Bikini Faso,
*07:24.220- 07:26.200* :  which is under threat from Islamist militants.
*07:26.540- 07:31.160* :  Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross told me more about the Russian group and its activities.
*07:31.940- 07:37.060* :  Nothing is ever made official, but what we understand is they were part of a group of
*07:37.700- 07:44.440* :  several hundred Russian paramilitary forces who were there to help in the fight against the
*07:44.440- 07:50.820* :  Islamist militants. But from some of the information that's been posted by this Bear Group,
*07:51.440- 07:57.700* :  they seem to spend some of their time protecting the military ruler of the country,
*07:57.820- 08:04.880* :  Colonel Ibrahim Tchaori. And perhaps not so much time fighting the Jihadists,
*08:05.380- 08:10.820* :  that there has been this partial withdrawal, but we understand probably at least 200
*08:11.660- 08:17.600* :  Russian troops are still in the country. But this seems to be all of what was called the
*08:17.600- 08:22.860* :  Bear Brigade leaving. But the troops who used to be under what was known as the Wagner group
*08:22.860- 08:27.820* :  and then became African Corps are still there. But all of these Russian troops, we understand
*08:27.820- 08:31.960* :  a kind of under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow.
*08:32.320- 08:35.400* :  Given the fact that a few days ago, there was one of the worst
*08:36.020- 08:41.920* :  Islamist attacks in recent months in Bikina Faso. The fact that now there are 200 Russians
*08:41.920- 08:47.420* :  going to be leaving, it puts the country in even more perilous situation, doesn't it?
*08:47.660- 08:53.680* :  It does. And I think it's a worrying time for Captain Ibrahim Tchaori who took power. I mean,
*08:53.680- 08:59.160* :  he has just cancelled a trip to China that he was due to go on. Perhaps a sign that he's
*08:59.620- 09:05.840* :  possibly a bit worried about his position at home. There have been these terrible attacks by
*09:05.840- 09:11.360* :  Islamist militants in recent days, including one last weekend. The authorities haven't said
*09:11.360- 09:17.160* :  officially how many people died, but locals are talking about more than 300 people being killed
*09:17.160- 09:24.160* :  in the north of the country. So not only could it personally be a problem for the military
*09:24.160- 09:30.840* :  ruler who may not have the close protection he had before, but also the fact that there are less
*09:30.840- 09:36.040* :  troops on the ground to help in the fight in theory against these Islamist militants could make
*09:36.040- 09:40.640* :  things more difficult because it seems to be kind of becoming a bit untenable. The fact he
*09:40.640- 09:45.420* :  seized power two years ago saying, you know, I'm going to make the country safer and it's got
*09:45.420- 09:51.820* :  worse. Well, Ross, now to the Middle East, in the West Bank, Israel's military operation is
*09:52.060- 09:57.180* :  continuing with the army saying it killed a Hamas commander on Friday. The fighting has attracted
*09:57.180- 10:02.820* :  criticism from the UN and a number of countries. On Thursday, the Israeli military withdrew from
*10:02.820- 10:08.900* :  a refugee camp near the city of Tulkaram. It says it killed five people, including the local
*10:08.900- 10:14.260* :  head of Islamic Jihad. Our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson has now made it to the camp
*10:14.260- 10:23.480* :  and sent this report. It wasn't easy carrying IED Abu Hajj's body through Nursham's refugee camp
*10:23.480- 10:29.900* :  today. His mother's house sits in an area scarred by demolition and destruction after a two-day
*10:29.900- 10:37.140* :  incursion by Israel's army. From there, they carried IED to the cemetery, a 69-year-old man with a
*10:37.140- 10:43.680* :  disability shot by a sniper, neighbors said, when he opened a window in his house during the operation.
*10:44.780- 10:50.680* :  At the cemetery, groups of young men fired automatic weapons in a separate ceremony to honour
*10:50.680- 10:57.420* :  another man killed during Israel's operation. Muhammad Jabba, the local leader of Tulkaram's armed
*10:57.420- 11:04.340* :  Palestinian groups. The birth of gunfire, a show of force from fighters here, less than a day
*11:04.340- 11:10.980* :  after Israel's army withdrew. Walking back through the camp, we passed Fadwa Abu IED. The remains
*11:10.980- 11:15.620* :  of her neighbor's house blocking her path to the streets with a huge pile of rubble.
*11:16.900- 11:20.400* :  They told us that we have tunnels and we smuggle the armed groups to this house.
*11:21.660- 11:26.860* :  It is impossible. He claimed that we have tunnels like those in Gaza. He brought a drill and dug
*11:26.860- 11:34.140* :  into the floor and all he found was a sewer manhole. Fadwa takes us through another entrance to her
*11:34.140- 11:41.000* :  house and shows us the broken floor. Beneath it, a small pipe and was appears to be a sewer drain
*11:41.100- 11:53.160* :  too small for a person to fit through. She says the conflict in the refugee camps here feels like
*11:53.160- 12:00.520* :  a little Gaza. It's something you hear a lot here now. The Gaza war is on a different scale
*12:00.520- 12:07.300* :  to this conflict but it's changed attitudes and tactics on both sides. Israel's army pulled
*12:07.300- 12:12.840* :  out of Tulkharam but its operation in the city of Janine further north seems to be intensifying.
*12:13.320- 12:18.840* :  Three men were reportedly killed by the army east of the city. Israel said they included a local
*12:18.840- 12:25.660* :  leader of Hamas. First of gunfire have begun again tonight in Janine and there's loud and constant
*12:25.660- 12:31.360* :  buzzing of military drones overhead. An Israeli commander involved in the operations here
*12:31.360- 12:36.840* :  said that terror organizations had taken over refugee camps in the northern west bank
*12:37.440- 12:41.560* :  and that the army would prevent them from damaging Israel. However long it takes.
*12:42.600- 12:48.740* :  Lucy Williamson in the west bank. Next to Brazil where X, one of the country's most popular
*12:48.740- 12:54.780* :  social media platforms, formerly known as Twitter, was suspended on Friday. The move was ordered by
*12:54.780- 13:00.060* :  the Brazilian Supreme Court. It's the culmination of months of tension between the authorities in
*13:00.060- 13:06.820* :  Brazil and Elon Musk, the owner of X. Mr. Musk has attacked what he called the pseudo-judge.
*13:07.280- 13:11.880* :  Luis Fajado is our correspondent in the region. He told me what the ruling means in practice.
*13:12.480- 13:18.560* :  The Supreme Court magistrate Morais has ordered the Brazilian telecommunications agency to
*13:18.560- 13:26.060* :  suspend access to X across Brazilian territory within 24 hours. They have also said that anyone
*13:26.060- 13:32.320* :  trying to access X through other measures. For example, VPNs, other technological means to try to
*13:32.320- 13:38.020* :  access the platform would also get severe fines. So it does seem to be a very serious measure to
*13:38.020- 13:44.200* :  suspend the activities of X across all of Brazil. And Tokus, why the Supreme Court judge has made
*13:44.200- 13:51.500* :  this order? Well, X had refused a previous order by the Brazilian judiciary to appoint a legal
*13:51.500- 13:57.620* :  representative in the company. This is because X said that if their employee in Brazil could be
*13:57.620- 14:05.160* :  subject to other kinds of legal penalties. And the origin of the dispute is in decisions by the
*14:05.160- 14:12.940* :  judiciary ordering X to suspend accounts which were said to be distributing this information,
*14:12.940- 14:19.380* :  false information. Many of these accounts were associated with followers of the former right-wing
*14:19.380- 14:26.000* :  president, Jair Bolsonaro. And X had been maintaining a dispute with Brazilian authorities
*14:26.620- 14:31.660* :  about these orders to suspend them. And they also had fines to pay because of their initial
*14:32.240- 14:37.460* :  refusal to suspend these accounts. During the course of the last few days, also Elon Musk,
*14:37.460- 14:43.400* :  the owner of X had become involved in this dispute. Very strong words being sent from Musk to
*14:43.400- 14:48.920* :  Brazilian authorities as the dispute escalated in the last few hours. Now, Elon Musk has said this
*14:48.920- 14:54.620* :  has happened simply because we would not comply with the judge's illegal orders to censor his
*14:54.620- 15:00.060* :  political opponents. Meanwhile, the president of Brazil, Enato Lula de Silva, has said, look,
*15:00.260- 15:04.860* :  any citizen from anywhere in the world who has investments in Brazil is subject to the Brazilian
*15:04.860- 15:10.620* :  laws. Who does Musk think he is? So those are the two dividing lines. What are Brazilians think
*15:10.620- 15:15.220* :  about all this? Brazilians are very, very politically polarized country, of course,
*15:15.220- 15:21.440* :  a substantial part of the population sympathizes with Bolsonaro, nearly half the population voted
*15:21.440- 15:26.220* :  for him in the last election, which he lost. So a lot of people will sympathize with the arguments
*15:26.220- 15:32.300* :  of Elon Musk saying that these accounts should not be restricted or suspended. This is, of course,
*15:32.300- 15:38.160* :  a discussion that has been also experimented in several other countries with political leaders
*15:38.160- 15:43.660* :  and their followers sending very questionable messages across social media. But, on the other hand,
*15:43.660- 15:49.740* :  many Brazilians, of course, will support this decision. They will say that Elon Musk is apparently
*15:50.640- 15:56.260* :  unwilling to accept the decisions of the Brazilian institutions. And in that sense, they should
*15:56.260- 16:02.060* :  face the consequences. Luis Fajardo there. It's being built as a major scientific discovery.
*16:02.060- 16:07.480* :  A new electric field that is as fundamental to Earth as gravity. A team from NASA describes
*16:07.480- 16:13.100* :  the planet-wide field as a great invisible force that lifts up the sky and is responsible for
*16:13.100- 16:18.120* :  the polar winds. Well, these winds interact with the fast-flowing, high-air currents known as
*16:18.120- 16:23.860* :  jet streams to help drive the majority of weather patterns across the globe. Suzy Inba is a
*16:23.860- 16:28.340* :  professor of planetary science here in the UK. She was part of the team who made the discovery
*16:28.340- 16:33.060* :  and she's been talking to Johnny Diamond. In order to measure this sami polar electric field,
*16:33.060- 16:38.340* :  and to get its profile with altitude, we had to launch a rocket that we launched from Svalbard,
*16:38.380- 16:46.140* :  and it went up to an altitude of about 760 kilometers. So it went pretty high and had a suite
*16:46.140- 16:51.800* :  of instruments on board, and they were measuring the electric field as the rocket went up in height.
*16:51.800- 16:56.480* :  So this is the first time that we've been able to make a direct measurement at this field.
*16:56.980- 17:04.240* :  When you had confirmation that this field existed, was that kind of, okay, tick? We knew that was
*17:04.240- 17:09.720* :  around and now we've had it confirmed. Or was it, wow, we have actually finally shown this exists?
*17:10.440- 17:14.360* :  Given that we had observed it on other planets, we had an expectation that it would be there.
*17:14.820- 17:18.940* :  And given that we had observed the result of it, this cold population of escaping ions,
*17:18.980- 17:24.060* :  we also believed it was highly likely it would be there. But to measure it and to measure it
*17:24.060- 17:29.880* :  accurately using our rockets gave us some parameters that we didn't have before. So there had been
*17:29.880- 17:34.620* :  some estimations that had been made before of the magnitude of this field, but we didn't have
*17:34.620- 17:39.520* :  an answer for what it looked like, and we certainly didn't quite understand how the electric
*17:39.520- 17:44.320* :  field varied with altitude. So to do this for the first time is actually quite a big step forward.
*17:44.900- 17:48.380* :  I need to ask you a question that I'm not sure you have an answer for, which is
*17:49.280- 17:55.860* :  what this field tells us about what the Earth is and how the Earth has developed. Do you know any of
*17:55.860- 18:00.500* :  that as yet? We don't know any of that. So this is just the beginning really in trying to understand
*18:00.760- 18:07.420* :  how this atmospheric escape process might have changed and influenced the developments
*18:07.420- 18:12.580* :  of the atmosphere on the Earth. We hope that colleagues working in that area will take the result
*18:12.580- 18:19.160* :  that we have and use that to influence more research in this area. Planetary scientist Susie Impa.
*18:21.940- 18:22.440* :  Still to come.

*20:05.180- 20:10.500* :  awareness about sexual health has been on a roughly upward trajectory since the start of the HIV
*20:10.500- 20:16.840* :  epidemic in the 1980s and since then the more widespread use of condoms around the world has
*20:16.840- 20:22.340* :  produced the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies in some parts of
*20:22.340- 20:28.360* :  the world but now the World Health Organization says one age group teenagers are showing an alarming
*20:28.360- 20:33.860* :  lack of interest in using them. Alfie Habershire reports it doesn't seem to matter where you are in
*20:33.860- 20:39.400* :  the world the trend is consistent fewer teenagers are using condoms without having sex an international
*20:39.400- 20:45.340* :  survey of a quarter of a million 15 year olds says almost 10% fewer boys are using them compared to
*20:45.340- 20:52.000* :  2014 and that means that in places like the UK the Netherlands and Sweden they are only used about half
*20:52.000- 20:58.100* :  of the time. The World Health Organization says this is alarming but not surprising it says in many
*20:58.100- 21:03.660* :  countries sex education has recently come under attack on the misunderstanding that it encourages
*21:03.660- 21:10.060* :  sexual behaviour. The WHO also points to the closure of schools during Covid that meant young people
*21:10.060- 21:15.420* :  missed out on learning about protection but others suggest it's a bit more complicated than that.
*21:24.380- 21:29.200* :  Because while classrooms may be quiet and subdued the conversation about protection on Tiktok is
*21:29.200- 21:35.180* :  loud and unfiltered and Dr Paula Briggs a sexual health consultant here in the UK says this may be
*21:35.180- 21:42.220* :  driving new attitudes. People are exposed to misinformation on social media and the focus is very
*21:42.220- 21:49.220* :  negative around hormonal contraception there are loads of myths in relation to sexual health and one
*21:49.220- 21:52.840* :  of those is that you can't get pregnant the first time you have sex well you know that's just not
*21:52.840- 21:58.400* :  true and I think we just need to be very transparent with young people. The WHO says more research
*21:58.400- 22:03.260* :  needs to be done to understand this worrying trend and how to turn it around but that it's clear
*22:03.260- 22:10.180* :  urgent action needs to be taken. That report by Alfie Haberson. Next to Spain and the capital Madrid
*22:10.180- 22:15.880* :  lies on a high plateau it gets very cold in the winter and unbearably hot in the summer. Trees
*22:15.880- 22:21.740* :  provide much needed shade on the hottest days but the local authorities have been removing them
*22:21.740- 22:27.260* :  from many areas in order to make way for renovation and development projects and that has prompted
*22:27.720- 22:31.020* :  strong opposition from locals as Guy Hegeco reports from Madrid.
*22:39.320- 22:45.660* :  Protesters chant against the removal of trees from the emblematic Plata Santa Ana in central Madrid
*22:45.660- 22:52.300* :  earlier this summer. This square has been part of a dispute between activists and local authorities
*22:53.360- 22:58.920* :  under a city hall plan almost all the squares trees would be felled or moved elsewhere
*22:58.940- 23:05.740* :  in order to allow work on an underground car park. I'm in Santa Ana Square where that protest
*23:05.740- 23:12.660* :  took place and looking at the far end of the square I can see a statue of the poet Federico
*23:13.060- 23:18.780* :  García Lordica but much of the square is taken up by cafes which have tables and chairs out
*23:19.340- 23:25.180* :  under parasols. There's several dozen trees here which include Cypresses, Chestnut trees and
*23:25.180- 23:31.760* :  some very tall plain trees. La La Mendes is a local activist who has been protesting against the
*23:31.760- 23:40.440* :  plan to remove the trees. I'm very angry I'm very sad at how our local authorities refuse to
*23:40.440- 23:45.720* :  take into account the wishes of residents these are our trees in a city which is becoming hotter
*23:45.900- 23:56.780* :  these are our haven from the heat where people can interact. The conservative mayor of Madrid
*23:56.780- 24:04.980* :  José Luis Almeida Martinez has played down the controversy. People are fond of these trees
*24:05.020- 24:10.360* :  but I'm confident that the work which is underway will have a limited impact on them
*24:10.860- 24:15.020* :  and the people of Madrid can be sure that we will replant the trees elsewhere
*24:15.660- 24:20.300* :  but this is just one of several sites in Madrid where the removal of trees to make way for
*24:20.300- 24:29.960* :  development or renovation projects has caused a backlash. Activists say 36,000 trees have been
*24:29.960- 24:36.860* :  lost since Mr Almeida Martinez took office in 2019 and that replanting initiatives have often
*24:36.860- 24:43.180* :  failed. Luciano Labajos is a horticulturalist with the organization environmentalists in action.
*24:49.440- 24:54.140* :  Mediterranean cities like Madrid have a big problem which has got worse in recent years
*24:54.820- 24:59.440* :  and is going to get even worse and that is the extreme temperatures we have in the summer.
*25:00.360- 25:05.440* :  One of the most important roles of trees in cities is to lower temperatures and increase humidity.
*25:10.880- 25:16.340* :  I'm back in the Plaza Santa Ana taking refuge in the shade of a chestnut tree as the
*25:16.340- 25:21.500* :  temperature starts to soar here. There has been some good news recently for those who've been
*25:21.500- 25:28.040* :  protesting because the removal of trees from this square has been put on hold at least temporarily
*25:28.040- 25:34.620* :  because of the protests so we'll have to wait for a final decision on the future of these trees
*25:34.620- 25:40.520* :  which for some are getting in the way of building work but which for others provide badly needed
*25:40.520- 25:48.760* :  respite from the Spanish sun. Guy Hedgeko in Madrid. The end of August means only one thing if you're
*25:48.760- 25:55.120* :  a football fan. The end of the summer transfer window it closed on Friday in many of Europe's
*25:55.120- 26:00.280* :  big leagues. It was the last chance that teams had to buy new players until January.
*26:00.860- 26:06.000* :  Traditionally millions of dollars have changed hands in the English Premier League alone as
*26:06.000- 26:11.240* :  the deadline approached. Minutes after that deadline passed I spoke to our sports reporter Paul
*26:11.240- 26:17.800* :  Serras. The two big deals that I'm talking about that we believe that BBC Sport believes are in the
*26:17.800- 26:24.840* :  offing our Raheem Sterling joining Arsenal from Chelsea and Jaden Santo joining Chelsea from
*26:24.840- 26:29.720* :  Manchester United. These are two players that are out of favour with their current clubs
*26:30.440- 26:36.940* :  but are on very big deals and are likely or were likely to stay where they were despite not
*26:36.940- 26:41.840* :  getting the kind of game time that they want from their respective managers. It looks like that's
*26:41.840- 26:48.060* :  all about to change. Jaden Santo is a childhood Chelsea supporter. United paid an awful lot of
*26:48.060- 26:53.940* :  money for him from Borussia Dortmund a few years ago. It hasn't worked for him. Maybe just maybe
*26:53.940- 26:59.740* :  a move to his childhood club. Chelsea will reinvigorate his career. He's still very young. We're
*26:59.740- 27:05.080* :  waiting for confirmation of that. United have been busy in the transfer window today.
*27:05.840- 27:10.600* :  They from Paris Saint-Germain have signed the Uruguayan international midfielder Manuel Ugate who
*27:10.600- 27:16.960* :  the United Boss Eric Tenharc has said is one of the best in the world in his position. They've
*27:16.960- 27:22.680* :  let Scott McTominay go. He's gone to Napoli and to Antonio Conte, the former Chelsea manager in
*27:22.680- 27:28.500* :  charge. Billy Gilmore has gone also to Napoli from Brighton. Wilfred Zahar, the Ivorian international
*27:28.500- 27:35.520* :  winger who spent last year at Galatasaray in Istanbul. He's gone to Leon in France on a season long
*27:35.540- 27:41.600* :  loan deal. Netto, the Brazilian goalkeeper, has joined Arsenal and all sorts of things have been
*27:41.600- 27:46.560* :  going on today. They're still going on. Now Frank on Yenka, the Nigerian has left Brentford. He's
*27:46.560- 27:52.700* :  gone to Germany to Augsburg. Maxwell Lequaz left Germany for England and Crystal Palace and
*27:52.700- 27:59.900* :  there's all sorts still in the offing. Maybe one of the bigger deals of the day, not necessarily
*27:59.900- 28:08.500* :  in terms of the finances, but, well, Fulham have, well, they are at least in negotiations with
*28:08.500- 28:15.980* :  Third Tier Birmingham City to sell one of their young forwards. I was Paul Starris.
*28:16.660- 28:22.700* :  So how does the transfer process work? One man who knows is Case Vos, head of the sports
*28:22.700- 28:30.280* :  entertainment group or SEG. He's an agent for the likes of Liverpool star Cody Gakbo and the
*28:30.280- 28:37.440* :  Manchester United manager Eric Tenhag. Matt Lyons has more. He set up SEG in 2000 with the childhood
*28:37.440- 28:44.000* :  friend Alex Cruz. It now boasts more than 600 clients from players, Rasmus Hoylin, Cody Gakbo,
*28:44.000- 28:49.680* :  to coaches Eric Tenhag, Pep Guardiola. In fact, it's been claimed he's the man controlling the
*28:49.680- 28:55.900* :  ins and outs Manchester United right now. He's got fingers in lots of pies with SEG now having clients
*28:55.900- 29:01.580* :  in cycling, e-sports and music. But what I wanted to know is how the football transfer window works
*29:01.580- 29:07.320* :  from the inside. It's all day by day. Of course, you try to prepare as much again, but one hand,
*29:07.320- 29:13.620* :  we represent talent, so then we try to do career planning with them. That goes from 17-year-old
*29:13.620- 29:19.980* :  players to experienced pros. So there's an ongoing process which goes out throughout the year, I
*29:19.980- 29:25.460* :  think. And then on the other side, we have clients with our clubs, you know, so that we are
*29:25.960- 29:30.820* :  hired by clubs to help them renovate their squads. Let's talk about getting a deal done,
*29:31.480- 29:36.320* :  when one of the key things to making sure that parties agree. You have to understand that if
*29:36.320- 29:40.460* :  his transfer is made, there's three parties involved. There's a buying club, there's a selling
*29:40.460- 29:44.900* :  club, and there's a player. And everybody is looking for the optimum for themselves. You know,
*29:44.900- 29:49.500* :  the buying club wants to pay as less as possible, and the selling club wants to receive as much as
*29:49.500- 29:55.460* :  possible, and the player wants to get the best deal or the best club out of it. And maybe if two
*29:55.460- 30:00.020* :  clubs are in agreement, the player doesn't even want to go to that club, that's a possibility.
*30:00.360- 30:05.340* :  If I go back 20 years, then you were managing a player or you were the agent to a player,
*30:06.080- 30:13.020* :  the only point of contact was the player, and then maybe his wife. Nowadays, it's way more than that.
*30:13.060- 30:21.200* :  It's father's, mother's, uncles, nephews, brothers, sisters, but then there's also people that they
*30:21.200- 30:26.660* :  trust. It could be financial advisor. It could be next door neighbor that I knew from
*30:26.700- 30:34.240* :  way before. And it's a sexy business. It's a feeling, so it appeals also to the people around
*30:34.240- 30:39.960* :  a player. So if that's how you get a deal done, what transfer is K's most proud he got over the line.
*30:40.300- 30:45.080* :  I've done many, many deals, but I think the one of Robin van Persie from Arsenal to
*30:45.080- 30:51.860* :  Manchester United is one that really stands out. Another new season, another new signing,
*30:51.860- 30:55.960* :  Manchester United's capture of Robin van Persie from Arsenal, a timely reminder
*30:55.960- 31:01.160* :  of why the Premier League remains so popular, big money, big names, and fleeting loyalty.
*31:01.800- 31:06.500* :  It was a deal between two clubs back then who didn't want to deal with each other.
*31:06.800- 31:12.740* :  It was back then when van Persie was in Arsenal and Sir Alex Ferguson was running Manchester United.
*31:13.040- 31:19.080* :  So it was not very likely that Robin would go to that club. To get that done was something
*31:19.080- 31:23.060* :  I'm proud of. I think it was a very good result.
*31:23.060- 31:26.100* :  And what then of a more recent high profile deal that was secured.
*31:26.100- 31:31.080* :  All the talk going into the FA Cup final last month was that Manchester United manager Eric
*31:31.080- 31:35.740* :  Tenharg was going to lose his job. Whatever happened. Well, what happened was they won.
*31:35.740- 31:41.020* :  And now two and a half weeks on, he's staying in charge. Manchester United have extended the
*31:41.020- 31:46.600* :  contract of manager Eric Tenharg until June 2026. Was he pleased when that was done?
*31:46.840- 31:50.440* :  If they're happy, I'm happy. If they know what don't want to continue with each other,
*31:50.980- 31:54.940* :  then I'm also happy. It doesn't matter. You know, I'm not the one who makes a decision.
*31:55.000- 31:59.360* :  You know, if a player moves or stays at a club, it doesn't matter for me.
*31:59.480- 32:02.300* :  If he's happy to stay, then we're happy that he's happy.
*32:02.640- 32:05.620* :  And in this particular case, there was a lot of speculation about it.
*32:05.620- 32:10.140* :  But in the end, everybody decided that it was the right fit, so then I'm happy.
*32:10.760- 32:14.120* :  The football agent, Case Vos, who was speaking to Matt Lines.
*32:15.420- 32:19.680* :  Marmosettes are tiny, tree-dwelling monkeys from South America.
*32:19.680- 32:24.380* :  They're shy little things with white locks of hair that sprout from the side of their heads,
*32:24.900- 32:29.700* :  but it appears they have a special talent scientists have discovered that these primates
*32:29.700- 32:33.700* :  actually use names for each other. This report from Wendierka.
*32:40.780- 32:46.500* :  That might sound like birds, but it's actually Marmosette monkeys having a chat in the rainforest
*32:46.500- 32:53.380* :  in South America. They're only 8cm long, feed on insects, fruit, sap and gum,
*32:53.380- 32:59.340* :  and these super cute little bundles of fur are native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
*32:59.340- 33:05.600* :  Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru. David Omer from Hebrew University in Jerusalem
*33:05.600- 33:11.800* :  is the lead author of a new study that's found that the high-pitched squeaks they use or fee calls
*33:12.340- 33:16.540* :  are how they communicate and that they use different names for each other.
*33:17.140- 33:21.080* :  The experiment took place in such a way that we took a pair of monkeys together,
*33:21.080- 33:25.040* :  so they knew it was the other monkey. Before we placed the visual barrier,
*33:25.380- 33:30.280* :  the interesting thing is that when we analyzed the calls, we saw that there was a very strategic
*33:30.280- 33:35.740* :  pattern of behavior for all of the monkeys and during the first call exchange,
*33:35.820- 33:40.760* :  it seems like the monkey was trying to affect names of different monkeys, and after about
*33:40.760- 33:46.160* :  20 calls, they sort of converge to the correct column for the other monkey on the other side and
*33:46.160- 33:52.180* :  stick to it. Marmosettes are the only primates to use names for each other, which is really useful
*33:52.180- 33:57.900* :  in the rainforest. Not only can they let each other know where they are, they also know who
*33:57.900- 34:03.760* :  they're talking to and can call for help if they need to. For them, social cohesion is extremely
*34:03.760- 34:09.460* :  important for survival, and this naming behaves probably helps to keep the family in a cohesive
*34:09.460- 34:15.600* :  structure in the jungle. Scientists are hoping that future studies will help them discover the
*34:15.600- 34:20.700* :  process by which the monkeys learn how to name each other. Wendy Earcart
