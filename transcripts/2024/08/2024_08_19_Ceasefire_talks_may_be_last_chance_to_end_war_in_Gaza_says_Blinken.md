*01:19.460- 01:22.720* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.560- 01:29.700* :  I'm Jenna Jaleon at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 19th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:30.440- 01:34.960* :  America's top diplomat calls this week a decisive one in ending the war in Gaza,
*01:35.520- 01:40.720* :  but when so many attempts before have failed, will these latest ceasefire talks be any different?
*01:40.720- 01:46.160* :  A Russian official says Ukraine has struck a third key bridge in the Kursk region
*01:46.680- 01:48.780* :  as it continues its cross-border offensive.

*01:57.800- 01:58.580* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:58.580- 02:03.200* :  I was going to sail around the globe in the world's smallest ship, but I bottled it.
*02:03.760- 02:08.240* :  We hear from the comedian who's won the funniest joke award at the Edinburgh French Festival.
*02:13.040- 02:18.120* :  As Israel and Hamas continue to accuse each other of obstructing the Gaza ceasefire talks,
*02:18.600- 02:23.360* :  America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken, back in the region for a series of high-stakes meetings
*02:23.360- 02:28.600* :  has said it's time for everyone to get to yes and to stop looking for excuses.
*02:29.200- 02:36.620* :  This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home,
*02:37.320- 02:43.120* :  to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security.
*02:43.840- 02:47.260* :  I'm here as part of an intensive diplomatic effort on President Biden's instructions
*02:47.900- 02:51.020* :  to try to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line.
*02:51.540- 02:53.200* :  It is time for it to get done.
*02:53.760- 02:58.100* :  Mr. Blinken held talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*02:58.760- 03:02.500* :  The Prime Minister's office described the two men's talks as positive.
*03:03.300- 03:09.800* :  In an earlier meeting, the Israeli President Isaac Herzog had these words for the U.S. Secretary of State.
*03:10.360- 03:16.340* :  At the bottom line of it, people have to understand it starts with a fuzzle of Hamas to move forward.
*03:16.940- 03:24.120* :  We are simply still very hopeful that we can move forward in the negotiations that are held by
*03:24.120- 03:30.560* :  the mediators. There is no greater humanitarian objective and there's no greater humanitarian cause
*03:31.000- 03:36.280* :  than bringing back our hostages home as they should have returned long ago.
*03:37.440- 03:43.100* :  With more than 40,000 deaths in Gaza since the October 7th attacks in which more than a thousand
*03:43.100- 03:48.040* :  people were killed, Louise Waterridge, a spokesperson for the UN Agency in Gaza,
*03:48.040- 03:53.500* :  Unra says that without an end to the fighting, civilians there cannot see a way forward.
*03:54.000- 03:57.740* :  People express on a daily basis that the ceasefire is the only hope.
*03:57.980- 04:01.860* :  They cannot continue living in such fear, with such exhaustion.
*04:02.500- 04:04.620* :  It's all people are talking about right now.
*04:04.620- 04:07.340* :  People here are desperate citizens ceasefire.
*04:07.700- 04:10.880* :  The civilian population of the Gaza Strip need this desperately.
*04:10.880- 04:12.800* :  The hostages need this desperately.
*04:13.480- 04:15.600* :  It really is the only choice right now.
*04:15.660- 04:18.340* :  People need this war to come to an end.
*04:18.680- 04:22.060* :  Our State Department correspondent Tom Bakeman is traveling with Mr Blinken
*04:22.460- 04:26.540* :  on what is his ninth visit to the region since the start of this war in Gaza.
*04:27.300- 04:31.580* :  I asked him why the U.S. was optimistic that there could be a breakthrough this time
*04:31.580- 04:34.280* :  when so many previous attempts have failed.
*04:35.120- 04:38.840* :  It's a kind of mix of optimism and expectation, I think, from the Americans.
*04:39.100- 04:42.660* :  And that is very much about using this language where they're saying,
*04:42.660- 04:46.380* :  this is the last chance, it's a decisive moment, it's an inflection point.
*04:46.860- 04:49.700* :  And saying that they think it's achievable, and that's the sort of optimistic part.
*04:49.740- 04:56.180* :  But as you say, nobody here on the ground is really sharing that particular assessment, I think.
*04:56.180- 05:02.000* :  And what Mr Blinken in the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to do
*05:02.000- 05:08.560* :  is cajol and push him to sort of stop trying to squeeze any more concessions out of this deal.
*05:08.820- 05:10.640* :  And to simply take it.
*05:11.320- 05:15.280* :  But I think the problem is, the Americans don't have a strong track record
*05:15.820- 05:22.820* :  on their leverage of which they have much actually affecting the course that the Israelis take during
*05:22.820- 05:25.560* :  the course of this conflict. Now, the Americans, I think, would dispute that.
*05:25.560- 05:30.800* :  They think they have got the Israelis to change position on things during the course of all this.
*05:31.680- 05:34.700* :  But my feeling is that Mr Netanyahu was digging in.
*05:34.700- 05:39.040* :  There was another defiant statement last night where he said that the Israelis will insist
*05:39.740- 05:44.180* :  on maintaining a presence in the south of the Gaza Strip along the so-called Philadelphia Corridor.
*05:44.180- 05:46.980* :  That's the border between Gaza and Egypt.
*05:47.320- 05:49.920* :  That's something that Hamas says they simply will not accept.
*05:49.920- 05:54.780* :  They accused Mr Netanyahu of inserting that as a new clause, and in their view,
*05:54.780- 05:58.860* :  they see it as continued occupation effectively, a continuation of the war.
*05:59.280- 06:01.600* :  So it doesn't feel like they've bridged that gap yet.
*06:01.740- 06:06.360* :  And I think the test will be on where the Mr Blinken is able to persuade Mr Netanyahu
*06:06.980- 06:11.440* :  to effectively accept this. And the deadline the Americans putting on this is really within the next week.
*06:12.160- 06:18.480* :  Yes, not much time there. And there are those in Israel itself who have questioned Mr Netanyahu's
*06:18.560- 06:24.280* :  good faith. Even Israeli officials have accused him in the past of sabotaging negotiations.
*06:25.240- 06:28.920* :  There have certainly been media reports in Israel that even those involved
*06:29.060- 06:35.860* :  closer than negotiations believe that he has thrown spanners into the works at various points
*06:35.860- 06:41.200* :  and much more publicly than that. We've heard from opposition officials in Israel
*06:41.720- 06:46.260* :  and not least some of the hostage families as well who accused him of stringing this out for his
*06:46.260- 06:52.280* :  own political survival. And the kind of converging timetables are really important here.
*06:52.820- 06:59.080* :  He claims that this is simply about extracting the concessions out of Hamas
*06:59.080- 07:04.740* :  that will keep Israel safe when the guns fall silent here. But I think it all comes down to,
*07:04.940- 07:10.240* :  as I say, whether or not Mr Blinken is able to really use American leverage to make him change
*07:10.240- 07:17.180* :  course. Tom Bateman, there are reports that Ukraine has sheld and damaged a third bridge over the
*07:17.180- 07:22.540* :  river same in the Kursk region of Russia. It's the last remaining crossing point on the river
*07:22.540- 07:28.020* :  in the area. Meanwhile in Ukraine itself, in the east, the authorities have ordered the evacuation
*07:28.020- 07:34.080* :  of families with children from the strategically important city of Pokrovsk and surrounding areas
*07:34.080- 07:40.500* :  as Russian forces close in. Vitaly Shevchenko from BBC Monitoring told me more about the importance
*07:40.500- 07:46.220* :  of the three bridges in Kursk that have been hit by Ukrainian attacks. Now these bridges,
*07:46.220- 07:53.740* :  they play a key role in the regional road network. And this morning, a person with
*07:53.740- 07:59.580* :  think is the official representative of Russia's official investigations committee said that this
*07:59.580- 08:05.540* :  third bridge has been damaged. Now, why am I saying there's a bit of uncertainty about who this
*08:05.540- 08:10.720* :  person is because he appeared to be in a video masked. So that's slightly unusual, but that's how
*08:10.720- 08:16.500* :  Russia is these days. Now, three bridges, we know that at least one of them is completely destroyed.
*08:17.500- 08:24.500* :  The other two are at least damaged, possibly destroyed as well. And the Russian forces
*08:24.500- 08:33.020* :  relied heavily on these bridges if they are gone. That means they are going to be cut off from
*08:33.020- 08:40.620* :  supplies and reinforcements. And meanwhile in Ukraine itself, there is this evacuation from
*08:40.720- 08:45.740* :  the city of Pokrovsk. Tell us about the city and why it matters and what this tells us about the
*08:45.740- 08:52.000* :  fighting in the east of Ukraine. The reason why Pokrovsk matters is because the Ukrainian army
*08:52.000- 09:01.200* :  relied heavily on logistics there. It's a key railway station and also it sits on an intersection
*09:01.240- 09:10.060* :  of several roads. If it falls, that will create big problems for the Ukrainians in Eastern Donbass
*09:10.060- 09:19.680* :  region. So if they had hoped that the Kursk incursion would distract Russians from fighting there,
*09:19.700- 09:27.520* :  it's not really working so far because the Russians are advancing slowly but surely. And if
*09:27.520- 09:33.980* :  Pokrovsk falls, that will open up the way to another town in the region called Chassiv Yar, which
*09:33.980- 09:40.200* :  sits atop of a hill. And if the Russians captured that, it will give them a better opportunity to
*09:40.200- 09:47.800* :  target Ukrainians in the area. Vitaly Shivchenko. Reports from Italy say a one-year-old child is
*09:47.800- 09:53.160* :  among 15 people who were rescued after a super yacht off the coast of Sicily sank after being caught
*09:53.160- 09:59.420* :  in a water spout. That's a weather event similar to a small tornado. The captain of a nearby
*09:59.420- 10:06.640* :  fishing trawler described what he saw in the port of Porticello. We went down to the boat while
*10:06.640- 10:12.040* :  waiting for sailors to go on a fishing trip. I saw flashes of lightning. At around 4 o'clock,
*10:12.040- 10:18.420* :  the water spout hit the town. Everyone inside the harbor was scared. Our boat was thrown onto its
*10:18.440- 10:24.660* :  side. 15 minutes later, we saw a flare in the sea. Once the water spout had passed, we went out
*10:24.660- 10:30.440* :  to inspect. All we saw were cushions and the rest of the boat which had sunk. As we record this
*10:30.440- 10:35.680* :  podcast, one person has been confirmed dead and several others are missing. Our reporter,
*10:35.680- 10:40.760* :  Tom Simons, told us more about the disaster. We have pictures at about five o'clock, four o'clock
*10:40.760- 10:47.960* :  local time in Italy, of a massive storm hitting a local town that fishing captain describing
*10:47.960- 10:53.040* :  what he saw, a water spout. Now we can't confirm that, but that's what he said he saw. What we do
*10:53.040- 10:58.420* :  know is that the Bayesian seems to have sunk at that point. The 22 people on board, that's about
*10:58.420- 11:05.140* :  12 guests and 10 crew, tried to escape and some of them 15 of them managed to get onto a nearby yacht
*11:05.140- 11:12.540* :  and then rescued by Coast Guard. But after that, nobody else emerged from the wreckage of this vessel.
*11:12.980- 11:17.560* :  It's thought that seven people are missing and certainly one body back has been filmed
*11:18.180- 11:23.700* :  being taken on to the shore. This is a British flag ship with crew and passengers on board,
*11:23.700- 11:28.280* :  who are mainly from Great Britain, but there is one New Zealand citizen, one from Sri Lanka,
*11:28.680- 11:34.380* :  an Irish national and two people with dual British French citizenship. And one of the survivors,
*11:34.380- 11:39.140* :  we understand, is a one-year-old child. Today, they've been searching the area both with
*11:39.340- 11:45.700* :  surface ships, but also divers who've been going down 50 meters to see this vessel, presumably,
*11:45.700- 11:53.480* :  on the bed of the sea, to try to spot anybody inside. Tom Simon's. The joke is that Chicago is
*11:53.480- 11:58.620* :  named the Windy City, not just because of its blustery weather, but because its politicians are
*11:58.620- 12:03.780* :  full of hot air. Well, this week we'll see plenty of that as the US Democratic National Convention
*12:03.780- 12:09.080* :  kicks off today in Chicago, with Carmela Harris seeking to build on the momentum that's rattled
*12:09.080- 12:14.160* :  her opponent, Donald Trump, after President Biden's last minute decision to drop out of the race
*12:14.160- 12:18.740* :  for the White House. There'll be four days of speeches as a party rallies behind the first
*12:18.740- 12:25.320* :  woman of color to become a presidential candidate, but the race still remains too close to call.
*12:25.380- 12:34.000* :  Emma Vardy reports from Chicago. It's a whiplash-inducing spectacle. Combine harvesters
*12:34.000- 12:38.820* :  colliding headfirst as mud flies into the air, the crowd cheering them on.
*12:38.820- 12:45.180* :  Okay, let's go, Kevin! At a county fair in Wisconsin, it's demolition, Derby time.
*12:48.180- 12:52.720* :  And as the competition heats up between these machines, so does the race for the White House,
*12:52.720- 12:57.020* :  and its voters in the swing states like this will have a big influence on who wins.
*12:57.500- 13:04.120* :  Before, it was, I think, Trump all the way, especially after the debate. I felt really secure
*13:04.120- 13:09.960* :  about that, and also about after what happened with his assassination attempt and everything,
*13:09.960- 13:16.600* :  and I was really encouraged about that with him. But now, with her excitement and everything,
*13:16.600- 13:24.020* :  I'm more fearful. I would consider myself a Republican. I don't know if Trump is the exact
*13:24.020- 13:31.320* :  answer for that party, but I sure, like his viewpoints, I like his policies. He's a little over
*13:31.320- 13:37.100* :  the top sometimes, as we all know, but he gets things done, doesn't he? He really does.
*13:37.620- 13:41.020* :  I can't even tell you who I'm going to vote for right now, and I've never been in this,
*13:41.860- 13:46.280* :  this predicament. How are you going to make up your mind? I'm going to watch the debates,
*13:47.340- 13:48.960* :  and then I'm going to make up my mind after that.
*13:51.560- 13:56.500* :  Across the state border, the Democrats have the stage set for their national convention in Chicago.
*13:56.580- 14:01.020* :  It's one of the most important moments for the party, as they try to drum up support
*14:01.020- 14:06.700* :  ahead of the presidential election in November. Inside the arena, workers are putting the finishing
*14:06.700- 14:12.520* :  touches here to all the rasma tabs that will unfold over the next four days. There's thousands
*14:12.520- 14:17.440* :  of red, white and blue balloons poised on the ceiling here to rain down on the convention,
*14:17.440- 14:23.740* :  and outside, metal barricades are up in preparation for big protests. There's huge anticipation
*14:23.740- 14:29.200* :  for this historic moment. As for the first time, a woman of color, Kamala Harris becomes a
*14:29.200- 14:37.140* :  presidential candidate. Visitors from across the United States are here to witness the political
*14:37.140- 14:41.560* :  theatre. To us, this is a really important election. The country is so divided right now,
*14:42.220- 14:47.180* :  so this isn't just a big party or a campaign rally. It affects people who have been
*14:47.180- 14:49.980* :  watching it, listening to the speeches, to determine who they're going to vote for, and
*14:50.560- 14:54.500* :  my kids are going to be future voters, so my three kids, we took them here and this is going to be
*14:54.500- 14:59.840* :  fantastic. As for Kamala Harris, the convention is a chance to introduce herself to the country,
*14:59.840- 15:04.740* :  and put more flesh on the bones of what she stands for. Kamala Harris has had a meteoric rise
*15:04.740- 15:10.720* :  from Joe Biden's running mate to being the Democratic nominee, to now leading in the polls
*15:10.720- 15:15.140* :  against Donald Trump, and she's done it all in less than a month. Mary Ann Marsh is a long time
*15:15.140- 15:20.960* :  Democratic strategist who's attended many conventions. She's optimistic that Kamala Harris is putting
*15:20.960- 15:25.420* :  the Democrats on a path to victory. For everyone who thinks she can't maintain the momentum,
*15:25.420- 15:30.120* :  they're still room for her to grow and she knows it, and if you go back to Obama in 2008,
*15:30.480- 15:37.800* :  that momentum went right through the election day. At the weekend, both Kamala Harris and Donald
*15:37.800- 15:42.980* :  Trump were hitting the campaign trail in the key swing states. When you stand for working people,
*15:42.980- 15:47.880* :  you fight for working people. When you stand for freedom, whether it be to make decisions about
*15:47.880- 15:56.220* :  your own body or love, who you love, you fight for those things. In Pennsylvania, Donald Trump
*15:56.220- 16:03.320* :  launched personal attacks against his rival. I'm a better looking person than Kamala. I'm
*16:03.320- 16:09.940* :  better looking than she is, and her speech yesterday, Kamala went full communist, you heard that
*16:09.940- 16:17.120* :  she went full communist, he wants to destroy a country. Back at the Derby, there's wreckage everywhere.
*16:17.660- 16:21.880* :  The combine harvesters have taken a beating, some are being towed out of the arena.
*16:25.120- 16:30.660* :  The presidential race has been upended in recent weeks, and the two new opponents are only just
*16:30.660- 16:37.320* :  at the beginning of their clash. That report by Emma Body.
*16:39.520- 16:43.420* :  Coming up in the Global News Podcast. When they ask, actually, if we give you a job,
*16:43.420- 16:49.340* :  would you take it? They're saying, well, no, no, because it's not a job I want. I don't want to
*16:49.340- 16:56.160* :  just jump on the right thing. I want to wait. We hear about a growing trend in South Korea,
*16:56.720- 16:59.060* :  the lack of appetite to look for a job.
*17:07.400- 17:13.940* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school. As in, they've got your back to school lunch
*17:13.940- 17:18.480* :  favorites, like snack packs and fresh fruit, and they've got your back to school supplies,
*17:18.480- 17:25.740* :  like backpacks, binders, and pencils. And they've got your back when your kid casually tells you
*17:25.740- 17:31.580* :  they have a huge school project to do tomorrow. Let's face it, we were all that kid.
*17:32.280- 17:38.400* :  So, first, call your parents to say I'm sorry, and then download the Instacart app to get
*17:38.400- 17:44.580* :  delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long. Get a $0 delivery fee with your first
*17:44.580- 17:49.440* :  three orders while supplies last, minimum $10 in order, additional terms apply.
*17:50.020- 17:54.660* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*17:54.660- 17:59.560* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices
*17:59.560- 18:04.580* :  technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*18:04.580- 18:10.000* :  You insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month
*18:10.000- 18:15.760* :  to just $15 a month. Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch. $45 up from payment equivalent
*18:15.760- 18:18.500* :  to $15 per month, new customers on first three month plan only, taxes and fees extra,
*18:18.500- 18:19.940* :  speed slower about 40 gigabyte CDTL.
*18:24.760- 18:29.260* :  He may be in jail, but that hasn't stopped Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan
*18:29.260- 18:34.880* :  from submitting an application to head Oxford University in England. According to an advisor,
*18:34.880- 18:39.780* :  Mr. Khan currently serving a prison term, in a case he says is politically motivated,
*18:40.360- 18:45.120* :  applied to be Chancellor of the University at the weekend. Imran Khan's studied philosophy,
*18:45.120- 18:49.380* :  politics and economics at Oxford, one of the world's most prestigious universities.
*18:50.140- 18:55.600* :  So why has the former Pakistani Prime Minister made this surprising move? Our correspondent in
*18:55.600- 19:01.400* :  Islamabad is Caroline Davis. When we asked the advisor about exactly why Imran Khan would want
*19:01.400- 19:06.620* :  to be the Chancellor of Oxford University, we were told that it is an extremely prestigious post.
*19:07.120- 19:12.460* :  Maybe it is symbolic, but it has scope for Imran Khan to offer a lot. They are quite adamant
*19:12.460- 19:15.760* :  that him being in jail, as they refer to it illegally, in jail,
*19:16.240- 19:21.180* :  won't hold him back. Of course, at the moment we don't know from Oxford University,
*19:21.180- 19:25.800* :  they have not made any statement about this and they won't confirm the list of candidates
*19:25.800- 19:31.380* :  that will be standing in that graduates and members of the faculty will be able to vote on.
*19:31.740- 19:36.540* :  That won't be made public until early October. So at the moment we're going off,
*19:36.820- 19:41.900* :  what his advisors have said. But yes, slightly surprising to have heard that Imran Khan
*19:41.900- 19:46.620* :  is wanting to stand for this position. The second time, of course, that he will be standing for
*19:46.620- 19:52.480* :  an election while he is in prison. And in terms of why he might want to do it, yes, it is
*19:52.720- 19:56.160* :  prestigious. But I think the other thing to bear in mind is that since Imran Khan has been in
*19:56.160- 20:01.140* :  prison, despite the fact that we haven't seen him out in public for over a year, his team have
*20:01.140- 20:05.960* :  been very effective at trying to keep him in the public consciousness. There have been different
*20:05.960- 20:10.660* :  things that have been done over the course of that year. For example, there was AI generated
*20:10.660- 20:17.320* :  speech that his team created using recordings of him. We've seen a lot of campaigning on social
*20:17.320- 20:24.280* :  media for Imran Khan. So it's possible that this is part of their way of making sure that Imran Khan
*20:24.800- 20:29.620* :  is kept in the public consciousness. And I'm sure that there will be quite a lot of effort to try
*20:29.620- 20:34.500* :  to get out the vote, although this is obviously a much smaller electorate, to show Imran Khan's
*20:34.500- 20:39.320* :  popularity as well in this vote too. Caroline Davis in Islamabad.
*20:40.180- 20:44.860* :  A BBC investigation has revealed dozens of workers from around the world may have been
*20:44.860- 20:50.760* :  trafficked by a small family-owned fishing firm in Britain. The fishermen came from the Philippines,
*20:50.760- 20:58.980* :  Ghana, Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka to work for TN trawlers of a nun in Scotland over a 10-year
*20:58.980- 21:06.680* :  period. 35 have been recognised as victims of trafficking by the British Home Office. Monica
*21:06.680- 21:07.660* :  Whitlock reports.
*21:11.700- 21:18.580* :  I'm Joel Quincy. I'm proud of the Philippines. Tra Manila. Well, I came here in the UK because the
*21:18.580- 21:24.920* :  salary in the UK is a lot higher compared to the Philippines. I apply for agency. They get me
*21:24.920- 21:30.980* :  hired to come over in the UK as a fisherman. When Joel Quincy landed at Heathrow Airport, he was
*21:30.980- 21:37.740* :  full of hope. Joel was 28, an experienced fisherman with a young family to care for. He was
*21:37.740- 21:43.680* :  travelling with three other Filipinos. They'd all signed on with TN trawlers of Annan, a Scottish
*21:43.680- 21:50.660* :  family firm specialising in scallop fishing. Joel said he worked extremely long hours and he says
*21:50.660- 21:57.920* :  there was never enough food or drinking water on board. We're at a drinking water, we get thirsty,
*21:57.920- 22:06.540* :  we get sweat. I eat tomatoes. I eat tomatoes just to wet my throat. Joel wasn't the only one.
*22:06.540- 22:13.120* :  Many other fishermen from overseas who worked on TN trawlers told us stories like Joel's. They said
*22:13.120- 22:18.880* :  they were hungry, thirsty, exhausted and their wages weren't paid in full. But they didn't want to
*22:18.880- 22:25.980* :  leave because they'd borrowed money to pay the crewing agencies back home. Most of them came from
*22:25.980- 22:32.360* :  the Philippines, but others came from India, Sri Lanka, Ghana and Indonesia. One day the towing
*22:32.360- 22:37.780* :  bow on Joel's trawler swung up. He leapt out of the way. So I managed to jump but still
*22:37.780- 22:44.140* :  pull in the deck. That's caused me head bleeding and loss of consciousness.
*22:45.780- 22:50.600* :  Joel finally got off the boat in Trun on the west coast of Scotland to get medical help.
*22:51.440- 22:55.200* :  Here's Karen Burston from the charity Fisherman's Mission in Trun.
*22:55.980- 23:03.500* :  I remember I made Joel a bowl of fruit salad. He was hungry and he was upset and he was in a strange
*23:03.500- 23:10.020* :  country. He didn't know what was going to happen and he was injured and he was overwhelmed. He began
*23:10.020- 23:19.440* :  to cry and he took a photo of the bowl of fruit salad to send his family to say that he was okay
*23:19.440- 23:24.120* :  and he was being given food. That marked the start of a major police operation.
*23:24.860- 23:31.040* :  Officers boarded TN boats and helped many fishermen off. At least 18 of them were recognised by
*23:31.040- 23:37.380* :  the home office as having been traffic, including Joel. The police asked them to stay in the UK as
*23:37.380- 23:43.920* :  witnesses in their investigations. But and here's the twist. It wasn't 2024 that all this happened.
*23:43.920- 23:49.940* :  It was 2012 more than a decade ago and between then and now no such cases come to trial.
*23:51.720- 23:57.820* :  Although TN trawlers was under investigation it continued to fish. Many more decades from overseas
*23:57.820- 24:03.580* :  worked on their boats, most of them from Ghana and they told us very similar stories to Joel's.
*24:04.320- 24:11.740* :  Here's Gideon Mensa. I've never seen that before in my life. How was it? How on earth did this
*24:11.740- 24:19.640* :  happen in Europe? How? But at the end of the day you need somebody to speak to. Who do you
*24:19.640- 24:25.440* :  know to speak to? The home office saw my case and said I have been traffic.
*24:26.100- 24:32.140* :  I'll read you what TN trawlers has said in their reply. They say, we absolutely refute any
*24:32.140- 24:37.940* :  allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking, adding that their workers were well treated and
*24:37.940- 24:45.100* :  well remunerated. Ten years after the police operation began, Joel, Gideon and the others are still
*24:45.100- 24:51.460* :  in the UK. They could have gone home but chose to stay as they were asked. Joel did finally get
*24:51.460- 24:57.380* :  some compensation for his head injury, £3000, but there's been no prosecution on trafficking
*24:57.380- 25:03.100* :  charges. That means although the men have waited so long they've never had their day in court
*25:03.100- 25:10.200* :  and never spoken out until now. So why did you keep me here all this? Why? If you don't want to
*25:10.200- 25:15.320* :  continue giving me or maybe witnessing their police, why did you keep me here?
*25:19.940- 25:25.540* :  We asked the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service of Scotland what happened. It said,
*25:25.540- 25:31.020* :  it's fully committed to tackling human trafficking and it goes on, we recognise that the time
*25:31.020- 25:35.980* :  taken in dealing with these complex and challenging matters has been difficult for those affected
*25:36.600- 25:41.440* :  and we deal with every case individually, taking action whether it's sufficient admissible
*25:41.440- 25:48.240* :  evidence that a crime has been committed. That report by Monica Whitlock. Southern African leaders
*25:48.240- 25:53.700* :  are holding talks at a summit in Zimbabwe on the alarming rise in inbox cases on the content
*25:53.700- 25:58.760* :  as you might have heard in our last podcast. Health ministers from several African countries
*25:58.760- 26:04.320* :  emphasised the urgent need for better preparedness, better cross-border surveillance and disease
*26:04.320- 26:10.120* :  and coordinated regional responses. The South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he was
*26:10.120- 26:16.500* :  very worried given that there had been more than 17,000 cases and over 500 deaths across Africa
*26:16.500- 26:22.300* :  since the start of the year. Dr Chris Van Stratton is a global health advisor at International
*26:22.300- 26:29.200* :  SOS in Johannesburg in South Africa. He spoke to Sona Safi. South Africa is the stranger to
*26:29.220- 26:35.560* :  infectious diseases and has been keeping an eye on monitoring the situation for several weeks and
*26:35.560- 26:41.860* :  months and we're also very fortunate to have some of the global experts in infectious diseases and
*26:41.860- 26:50.680* :  academics in South Africa. So part of the Ramaph support for the CDC Africa's announcement
*26:50.680- 26:57.380* :  which was then shortly followed by the WHO announcement of a pandemic of international concern,
*26:58.560- 27:06.320* :  that those announcements really have been a call out and an enabler for the block and for the WHO
*27:06.320- 27:13.140* :  to then start engaging with different ministries of health to make sure that one we can test,
*27:14.760- 27:20.160* :  check which claims are being picked up and in what locations and they're also very
*27:20.160- 27:28.540* :  importantly be able to start to engage and try to get these very important vaccines into the
*27:28.540- 27:34.160* :  different countries so at least they can be a focused immunization campaign. And what is the
*27:34.160- 27:39.820* :  advice for people on the ground because those are the policies and in theory what should people
*27:39.820- 27:49.140* :  do practically? It spread primarily from skin to skin close contact and usually the someone who's
*27:49.140- 27:57.100* :  got the rash and those viscals are open that fluid when it bursts out the viscals is full of virus
*27:57.700- 28:03.840* :  and that's usually when people will pick it up. For most individuals the treatment is supportive,
*28:03.860- 28:10.360* :  it will be maintain your fluids, good nutrition, get lots of rest and your body will heal up
*28:10.780- 28:20.260* :  in 24 weeks. For those who are immune compromised, such as someone who has got HIV or other
*28:20.540- 28:25.640* :  conditions like cancer that can suppress their immune system, doctors will certainly want to
*28:26.840- 28:33.300* :  be more attentive, we might admit that patient and they are antivirals available and especially
*28:33.300- 28:38.280* :  available in the developed world. Dr. Chris Van Strassen and if you want to know more about
*28:38.280- 28:44.740* :  impacts and the risk it poses why not check out the latest episode of the global story podcast
*28:45.400- 28:49.800* :  just search for the global story wherever you listen to your podcasts.
*28:51.940- 28:57.220* :  Now let's talk about a growing phenomenon in South Korea. Not only are an increasing number of
*28:57.220- 29:02.740* :  Koreans under the age of 30 struggling to find a job but some of them have given up looking as
*29:02.740- 29:08.180* :  they feel the search has become pointless. Our business reporter Pierre Antoine Denny told my
*29:08.180- 29:14.160* :  colleague Andrew Peach why this is happening. Basically this is a very interesting data that
*29:14.160- 29:18.800* :  just coming out of South Korea has been a kind of a rising issue. This number of young people that
*29:18.800- 29:26.140* :  are not in education, employment or training was the highest last month for any Mosulite on record
*29:26.680- 29:34.840* :  and that's a 10% increase since last year. So that's basically put it at around 440,000 people
*29:35.340- 29:43.300* :  that are under 30 and basically yeah as you said don't want to get a job, stop looking and
*29:43.300- 29:48.420* :  for different reasons because when they ask actually if we give your job would you take it they're
*29:48.420- 29:53.920* :  saying well no no because it's not a job I want. I don't want to just jump on the right thing.
*29:54.260- 30:00.160* :  I want to wait but it is growing. It is becoming some sort of a problem in South Korea and because
*30:00.840- 30:05.280* :  their authorities are of course worrying about this becoming a trend.
*30:05.500- 30:10.560* :  And is there any evidence of this being a broader thing than just isolated to South Korea?
*30:11.280- 30:16.260* :  People of course across the world there is this growing tendency. There's been some sort of trends
*30:16.260- 30:20.480* :  on social media about people explaining why they're becoming now this acronym,
*30:21.020- 30:26.600* :  neat and ET, non-education, employment or training and growing to the fact of being
*30:26.600- 30:33.040* :  Gen Z or millennials, being aware of being on the firing line and being the first one to be fired
*30:33.520- 30:39.500* :  or just to not being in the job that they make them happy and just wanting the right place,
*30:39.500- 30:44.900* :  the right job and trying to move away from what is too well known as the hustle culture
*30:45.340- 30:49.400* :  and moving into a situation where they can be in a workplace culture that they
*30:49.960- 30:54.860* :  really appreciate and that they can work without being worried about all these things.
*30:54.860- 30:58.500* :  So but you should, according to the international labour organisation,
*30:58.500- 31:05.720* :  a fifth of people between 15 and 24 worldwide in 2023 were considered as needs.
*31:06.220- 31:11.960* :  So this probably is becoming a growing trend and a growing worry for governments across the world.
*31:13.060- 31:18.400* :  Pierre Antoine Denny. Now to end this podcast, are you ready for a laugh?
*31:18.460- 31:23.380* :  Well, the title of funniest joke at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival has been announced.
*31:23.380- 31:27.920* :  I was going to sail around the globe and the world's smallest ship, but I bottled it.
*31:28.260- 31:33.540* :  Did you get it? The writer of that quarka of a joke is Mark Simmons. He's been telling the BBC
*31:33.540- 31:38.180* :  about how he found out he'd won the title and how he comes up with his material.
*31:38.820- 31:45.800* :  With this joke, it's a nice bit of wordplay. Some jokes, it's all about like taking people down one
*31:45.800- 31:49.840* :  way and then doing a twist and then the twist is surprising, makes people laugh.
*31:50.580- 31:55.060* :  But I think the best jokes, when it creates like an image in your head, I think they're the best jokes
*31:55.060- 31:59.080* :  so you can really visualise what's happening. I just do one line as that's my thing, yeah.
*31:59.360- 32:04.560* :  I think I find it uncomfortable talking too long on stage without a laugh, so I try to get to laugh
*32:04.560- 32:10.020* :  as quick as possible. So in an average show, I've probably got about 200 jokes, done the video jokes
*32:10.020- 32:17.560* :  are true with what I do. So I kind of, the way my brain works, I kind of go around a spot word
*32:17.560- 32:23.720* :  play quite easily and then I'll write it down and then once I've kind of got maybe 10 ideas,
*32:24.200- 32:28.620* :  I'll craft them into jokes and then go to a new material night, try it out. If it works,
*32:28.660- 32:32.540* :  it's in the show and then it doesn't work, back to drawing board, change a few bits around,
*32:32.540- 32:35.980* :  go back and try it. So yeah, a long, long, long, long process.
*32:36.760- 32:41.020* :  Well that was Mark Simmons there who won the title of the funniest joke at the Edinburgh
*32:41.020- 32:46.740* :  Fringe Festival. Well let's see what the competition was like. Here are a few of the jokes he beat.
*32:47.580- 32:51.580* :  I've been taking salsa lessons for months but I don't feel like I'm progressing,
*32:51.580- 32:56.840* :  it's just one step forward and two steps back. Here's another one,
*32:57.300- 33:04.040* :  et horse at a restaurant once. Wasn't great, starter was all right but the main was dreadful.
*33:05.900- 33:11.940* :  And one of my personal favourites, I'm an extremely emotionally needy non-binary person.
*33:12.420- 33:18.180* :  My pronouns are they're there. And if you want to hear more like this, you can find the
