*00:28.500- 00:34.380* :  influence the election? And how will Tim Walls and JD Vance impact the final months of the race?

*00:47.860- 00:50.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:52.440- 00:58.080* :  I'm Andrew Peach and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 8th of August, these are our main stories.
*00:58.660- 01:03.540* :  The economist Muhammad Yunus arrives in Bangladesh to lead a caretaker government after weeks of
*01:03.540- 01:08.660* :  turmoil. Conor's push to my is back in Barcelona, the Catalan separatist leader has been addressing
*01:08.660- 01:14.600* :  supporters and risking arrest. The mayor of Nagasaki in Japan defends his decision not to invite
*01:14.600- 01:22.400* :  Israel to the annual atomic bomb commemoration. Also in this podcast Joe Biden warns there may not be
*01:22.400- 01:29.060* :  a peaceful transfer of power if Donald Trump loses the US presidential election. And it's going to
*01:29.060- 01:34.980* :  be a good impact in Morocco because girls are so scared like to do a break-in now though. I guess it's
*01:34.980- 01:41.400* :  going to be like a support for them. The Moroccan B girl taking part in the very first Olympic breaking
*01:45.540- 01:49.580* :  competition. Muhammad Yunus soon to be the new interim leader of Bangladesh has landed back in
*01:49.580- 01:57.180* :  Ducca. I feel good and back. A lot of work to be done. People are excited. Know that something new
*01:57.180- 02:02.540* :  opportunities have arrived. What is your message for people here? Discipline, discipline,
*02:02.540- 02:08.840* :  hard work and get it done. The 84-year-old economist and Nobel laureate smile broadly as he was
*02:08.840- 02:13.620* :  greeted with flowers. He'll be sworn in with a new cabinet later. It's a quick turn-about of
*02:13.620- 02:18.680* :  events after protests forced the resignation of the previous Prime Minister Shaker Sina on Monday
*02:18.960- 02:24.340* :  after 15 years in office. Mr Yunus said it was those protesters' efforts that had given the nation
*02:24.340- 02:29.920* :  a second independence, a freedom which he said now had to be protected. A correspondent Akbar
*02:29.920- 02:36.020* :  Hussein in Ducca told me more about how Mr Yunus was received. When he arrived here he was surrounded
*02:36.020- 02:43.840* :  by student leaders and before that he was welcomed and greeted by the army chief, Bangladesh's
*02:43.840- 02:49.780* :  naval chief and the Air Force chief and some other security forces chief. Mr Yunus said that
*02:49.780- 02:55.380* :  this is the time to rebuild the country and he will have to organize many things and he urged
*02:55.380- 03:01.940* :  people not to indulge in any violence. He said that he has many things to do. So if people
*03:01.940- 03:06.540* :  indulge in violence then he describes it as a revolution. Then he said that then the
*03:06.540- 03:11.440* :  result would be a revolution might be negative. That's why he is asking people to remain calm
*03:11.440- 03:16.820* :  and he said that no revenge should be taken because he said that, you know, Bangladesh is a country
*03:16.820- 03:22.660* :  which has an immense potential and if we do anything which might jeopardize our potential,
*03:23.240- 03:29.940* :  then the result of the revolution would be very negative. That's why he is urging people to
*03:29.940- 03:35.680* :  cooperate him. Certainly a very warm welcome for him. Muhammad Yunus is an economist, a
*03:35.680- 03:41.060* :  high profile one. Do we think he has the skills to be a political leader? This is a very big
*03:41.060- 03:47.500* :  question because so far many people think that the professor Muhammad Yunus is the best option
*03:47.660- 03:53.300* :  for Bangladesh so far because there is a political vacuum, Shaykhasina fled the country,
*03:53.340- 04:00.880* :  another leader Khaled Azia. She is not well physically and her party is in a disorganized position.
*04:00.880- 04:08.900* :  So many people think that, you know, Bangladesh should be managed by someone who has a vision
*04:09.460- 04:14.120* :  and they think that the professor, you know, is the right person. But, you know, we don't know yet
*04:14.120- 04:19.740* :  how long he will continue. There is no specific time. It might be one year, it might be two year,
*04:19.740- 04:24.540* :  it might be six months, but we don't have any clear picture yet. But the thing is that this is
*04:24.540- 04:29.620* :  certain. It's going to be a non-party interim government. There will be no political affiliation
*04:29.620- 04:33.940* :  of the people who will be included in this government. So the student leaders, they think that,
*04:34.360- 04:39.740* :  you know, a free fair and elections could be held in the leadership of Professor Muhammad Yunus.
*04:40.140- 04:45.700* :  Akbar Hussein in Duck Up. After nearly seven years in exile, the former separatist leader of
*04:45.700- 04:51.120* :  Catalonia, Carlos Pujdema has returned to Spain despite the threat of an outstanding arrest warrant
*04:51.120- 04:56.280* :  for alleged embezzlement. According to the Catalan public broadcaster, police have launched an
*04:56.280- 05:01.480* :  operation to find an arrest Mr Pujdema. So far, he seems to have evaded that, though. One police
*05:01.480- 05:06.700* :  officer has been arrested on suspicion of helping him to escape. All this, shortly after he
*05:06.700- 05:11.940* :  addressed supporters outside the Catalan Parliament, saying any crackdown on the pro-independence
*05:11.940- 05:19.980* :  movement would harm the credibility of Spanish democracy. We should not be fooled, we should
*05:19.980- 05:25.060* :  not be deceived. It is not, it was not, and it never will be a crime to hold a referendum,
*05:25.100- 05:30.020* :  and it never will be a crime to obey the mandate of the Parliament of Catalonia.
*05:30.260- 05:35.120* :  Inside the Parliament building, it is taking place ahead of the swearing in at the new head of the
*05:35.120- 05:39.440* :  regional government there. I've got an update on the police operation from our Europe Regional
*05:39.440- 05:44.600* :  Editor, Danny Aberhardt. It's an extraordinary situation, so they appeared in central Barcelona
*05:44.600- 05:49.460* :  to a hero's welcome Andrew, people shouting for independence, calling him president, his old
*05:49.460- 05:56.380* :  title as the head of the region there, and then he disappeared. Now, the police are trying to
*05:56.380- 06:02.880* :  locate him. They're setting up roadblocks around parts of Barcelona on key roads and elsewhere
*06:02.880- 06:09.560* :  in Catalonia. They say that he's believed to have travelled in a white car, and they're doing this
*06:09.560- 06:15.740* :  under the nickname Operation Cage, but it's an extraordinary situation. Meanwhile, inside
*06:15.740- 06:22.660* :  the Catalan Parliament, the investor debate continues as to whether Salvadorilla, the socialist
*06:22.660- 06:27.960* :  who's a part of the governing ruling party, becomes the next head of the region, and he is not
*06:28.540- 06:33.200* :  in favour of independence. It'll be the first time in 10 years that a non-independent supporter
*06:33.200- 06:38.120* :  headed the region. Today's event looks like some kind of movie in the making, but that's the
*06:38.120- 06:42.160* :  whole point of the timing, isn't it? We're about to get a Catalan leader who doesn't favour
*06:42.540- 06:46.100* :  independence and, hey, presto, Carlos, push him right, he's back on the scene.
*06:46.260- 06:51.620* :  Yeah, I think if Elty had to come back now after spending nearly seven years trying to resist
*06:51.620- 06:58.440* :  all attempts to extradite him to Spain from self-imposed exile. Now, the key thing here is that
*06:58.440- 07:04.880* :  that Spain's government and parliament passed an amnesty law for Catalan independence leaders,
*07:04.880- 07:10.400* :  pro-independence leaders. That passed through the parliamentary process, but then the Supreme Court
*07:10.400- 07:15.700* :  threw a spanner in the works. It said that part of that charge of embezzlement did not apply to
*07:15.700- 07:21.540* :  Carlos Pujtumon and other Catalan separatists, so that's why then the arrest warrant is still there,
*07:22.020- 07:27.740* :  and that, of course, is what Pujtumon is doing, is saying basically Spain's government has passed
*07:27.740- 07:32.280* :  an amnesty law, but then he's not giving amnesty, so that really affects the credibility,
*07:32.280- 07:37.320* :  as you mentioned, of Spain's democracy. Danny Abar there. Since I spoke to Danny, the authorities
*07:37.320- 07:43.320* :  in Barcelona have said that roadblock operation has been called off. The mayor of the Japanese
*07:43.320- 07:48.940* :  city of Nagasaki has defended his decision not to invite Israel's ambassador to a ceremony
*07:48.940- 07:55.160* :  to mark the anniversary of the US atomic bombing of the city in 1945. His comments came after
*07:55.160- 07:59.980* :  ambassadors from several western countries, including the US and Britain, confirmed they would
*07:59.980- 08:06.040* :  also skip the service in solidarity with Israel. Shima Haleel is in Tokyo. Nagasaki's mayor Shira
*08:06.040- 08:10.220* :  Suzuki said security reasons, including potential demonstrations against the war in Gaza,
*08:10.660- 08:14.800* :  were behind his decision not to invite Israel to the atomic bombing commemoration ceremony.
*08:14.800- 08:19.180* :  A spokesperson for the British Embassy in Tokyo confirmed to the BBC that Ambassador
*08:19.180- 08:23.800* :  Julia Longbottom will not attend the ceremony in Nagasaki. Britain's ambassador had said the
*08:23.800- 08:28.860* :  decision not to invite Israel created an unfortunate and misleading equivalency with Russia and Belarus.
*08:28.860- 08:33.820* :  The only other countries not invited. The US ambassador Rami Manuel will also not attend.
*08:33.820- 08:38.800* :  An embassy statement said the mayor of Nagasaki had politicized the event by snubbing Israel.
*08:39.240- 08:43.020* :  Gillard Cohen, Israel's ambassador, who was invited to attend a memorial ceremony
*08:43.020- 08:47.340* :  in Hiroshima on Tuesday, said Nagasaki's decision sent a wrong message to the world.
*08:47.340- 08:52.800* :  In June, Mr. Suzuki had sent a letter to the Israeli embassy calling for an immediate cease-fire
*08:52.800- 08:59.240* :  in Gaza. Three years ago, the Taliban retook the Afghan capital Kabul after the withdrawal
*08:59.240- 09:05.000* :  of US-led international forces. I was live on the BBC World Service as that happened on the day.
*09:05.000- 09:09.880* :  People were predicting exactly what followed the gradual removal of women from public life.
*09:10.540- 09:14.940* :  Senior UN officials are leading a campaign to recognise it as gender apartheid.
*09:15.440- 09:20.540* :  Crassi Twig from BBC Monitoring looks at the historical context of the current rulers' fixation
*09:20.540- 09:29.420* :  with women. In August 2021, the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan. Unlike their first
*09:29.420- 09:35.520* :  rule in the 90s, they now control the whole country. The consequences for women have been profound.
*09:35.580- 09:42.060* :  Women are not allowed to go to schools, to universities, to park, James, beautiful others.
*09:42.060- 09:48.680* :  They're not allowed to work. They're not allowed to travel alone. The life is like a prison.
*09:49.300- 09:54.520* :  Shazia Haya regularly talks to women in Afghanistan for her programmes for BBC Pashto.
*09:59.780- 10:04.340* :  She presents an educational programme, too, for Afghan children, called Dars.
*10:04.860- 10:09.440* :  He changed to fill some of the vacuum created by the Taliban's ban on schooling for girls
*10:09.440- 10:16.720* :  beyond sixth grade. Salamona Jor Bahay. The BBC Dars Dakhir Aglas, Dars means
*10:16.780- 10:23.120* :  a lesson. One girl told us that Dars is like a light at the end of a dark tunnel.
*10:23.120- 10:29.200* :  The Taliban's education policies haven't just affected girls. They've been strident efforts
*10:29.200- 10:35.320* :  to mold the next generation of men. Haroon Rahmani is watching the country for BBC Monitoring
*10:35.600- 10:41.320* :  from London. The Taliban are graduates of the madrasas from the tribal areas of Pakistan.
*10:42.220- 10:48.320* :  They have repurposed and turned most of the educational buildings, schools and some of the
*10:48.660- 10:52.240* :  bases which were used by the US and its allies to madrasas.
*10:55.700- 11:00.200* :  And they also allocate more funds for madrasas than school.
*11:00.920- 11:06.040* :  To understand how the Taliban see their place in the world and to find the seeds of their
*11:06.040- 11:12.680* :  animosity towards gender equality, we need to go back in time. This is Barry Sadid from BBC Monitoring.
*11:13.140- 11:19.300* :  In October of 1928, one of Afghanistan's first reform and governments was led by a king,
*11:20.080- 11:25.020* :  Amon Al-Akhon. He was directly inspired by the West. He brought about some serious reforms in
*11:25.020- 11:30.540* :  terms of prohibiting polygamy, bringing about a minimum marriage age for women, creating a
*11:30.660- 11:34.800* :  specific hospital for women and introducing a handful of girls, schools mostly confined to the
*11:34.800- 11:42.020* :  Kabul. These reforms triggered a mass backlash. Several tribes rose up against him and Amon Al-Akhon
*11:42.020- 11:47.300* :  was portrayed as being a threat to Islam and overthrown accordingly. But I think what we can see
*11:47.360- 11:53.080* :  from this sequence of events in Afghan history is how women became a proxy for the nation's image
*11:53.080- 11:59.700* :  of itself. According to Barry's analysis, a long list of foreign interventions has created a deep
*11:59.700- 12:05.280* :  suspicion among Afghans towards foreign values. It was established in the mind of more
*12:06.040- 12:11.320* :  conserved to Afghans, this connection between reforms around gender and foreign intervention.
*12:11.720- 12:16.780* :  Because since 1979, we've seen two successive interventions by foreign powers,
*12:17.680- 12:22.680* :  first by the Soviet Union in the 80s and then following on by the Americans, both of which
*12:22.960- 12:28.920* :  in different ways were justified on the basis of wanting to develop Afghanistan and bring about
*12:28.920- 12:35.100* :  a more liberal and western inspired gender norms. The two decades of US-led intervention
*12:35.100- 12:41.760* :  introduced many freedoms. In 2021, the Taliban inherited the society where women too
*12:41.760- 12:52.560* :  felt entitled to their rights. Afghanistan had some brave women and they
*12:52.560- 12:59.500* :  went to streets and they had their protests. According to some reports, some of them were detained
*13:00.420- 13:04.940* :  and also there were some claims about torture and bad behaviors.
*13:05.560- 13:10.840* :  The resistance was eventually muscled. In the meantime, senior UN officials have pushed
*13:10.840- 13:16.140* :  for what they call the Taliban's gender apartheid to be recognized as a crime against humanity.
*13:17.060- 13:20.140* :  And here's the view from the Taliban. Women, women, women.
*13:22.200- 13:29.100* :  Now the women are not a complete part of our economy. So if they will sit 50% of our population,
*13:29.100- 13:33.400* :  if they will sit in home, so the next 50% will take care of them.
*13:33.740- 13:39.080* :  That report by Krasi Twig from BBC Monitoring, you can hear more about that story by searching for
*13:39.080- 13:44.580* :  the Global Jigsaw, wherever you get your podcasts. Still to come?
*13:44.580- 13:52.300* :  We have recovered chemical substances, liquids, explosive devices and technical equipment.
*13:52.300- 13:56.940* :  Austrian intelligence services reveal more details of an attack that was planned for a
*13:56.980- 13:58.660* :  Taylor Swift concert in Vienna.
*14:09.000- 14:14.480* :  I'm Katrina Perry from the Global Story Podcast. Kamala Harris announces her running
*14:14.480- 14:19.540* :  mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls. But do the vice presidential candidates really influence
*14:19.540- 14:24.940* :  the election? And how will Tim Walls and JD Vance impact the final months of the race?
*14:26.160- 14:30.980* :  The Global Story brings you unique perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.
*14:31.580- 14:33.540* :  Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*14:40.580- 14:45.100* :  President Biden has expressed his concern. There may not be a peaceful transfer of power
*14:45.440- 14:48.460* :  if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November.
*14:48.960- 14:53.020* :  He was speaking to CBS News in his first interview since stepping down from the race.
*14:53.020- 14:58.340* :  If Trump loses, I'm not coming along. He means what he says. We don't take them seriously.
*14:58.980- 15:03.340* :  He means it. All the stuff about it. If we lose, there'll be a bloodbath.
*15:03.700- 15:05.420* :  You can't love your country only when you win.
*15:06.080- 15:09.760* :  Alex Ritson got reaction from our North America correspondent, Peter Bose.
*15:10.340- 15:14.780* :  It's not a surprise when Donald Trump first made the bloodbath comment.
*15:14.780- 15:20.380* :  President Biden responded then by accusing Mr. Trump of fomenting political violence.
*15:20.460- 15:25.900* :  He posted it on X. It's clear that this guy wants another January of the sixth.
*15:26.000- 15:31.460* :  So Mr. Biden is really just now echoing those comments in a new interview where he was asked
*15:31.460- 15:36.720* :  about the transition process, clearly expressing concern that Donald Trump might again
*15:36.720- 15:39.940* :  claim that the election was stolen if he loses.
*15:40.360- 15:44.880* :  One other thing to say in terms of context is that Donald Trump made that remark while
*15:44.880- 15:50.580* :  speaking about the potential loss of American car manufacturing jobs to foreign countries.
*15:51.120- 15:57.560* :  And his campaign said his bloodbath comment should be taken in that context that the former
*15:57.560- 16:01.200* :  president was saying that if Joe Biden won the election, he will still candidate then
*16:01.200- 16:05.880* :  that it would be an economic bloodbath for the US car industry.
*16:05.880- 16:11.240* :  A very different meaning, although as we're hearing, really, that comment has been widely interpreted,
*16:11.240- 16:16.720* :  including it seems by President Biden to have more sinister and perhaps violent undertones.
*16:17.000- 16:19.300* :  Yeah, but it's not just the bloodbath comment.
*16:19.440- 16:21.820* :  Is it? He said a lot of things during campaigning.
*16:21.820- 16:28.700* :  One of the other ones, he said there wouldn't be another election in the US if he didn't win.
*16:28.700- 16:34.460* :  Is that just talk? He said, we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote,
*16:34.520- 16:36.940* :  which certainly raised a few eyebrows.
*16:36.940- 16:42.580* :  It certainly is talk and it's the kind of talk that honestly not many people really understand
*16:42.580- 16:48.220* :  what he was saying. The Democrats said the comment implied that Mr. Trump would end elections
*16:48.220- 16:52.780* :  in the United States if he won a second term. And it prompted debates about whether democracy
*16:52.780- 16:59.620* :  itself was under threat. It was about to end democracy, according to Kamala Harris's campaign.
*16:59.620- 17:05.500* :  But the Trump campaign, they had an alternative explanation. A spokesperson said he was talking about
*17:05.500- 17:11.320* :  uniting this country and bringing prosperity to every American. So it's political talk that many
*17:11.320- 17:16.580* :  people struggle to decipher and given the fast-moving new cycles, as we call them here,
*17:16.580- 17:21.940* :  it's probably already been forgotten by most Americans until, of course, it is brought up again by
*17:21.940- 17:26.080* :  most likely the Democrats and perhaps in one of the debates in the next few weeks.
*17:26.760- 17:31.580* :  Now we know who the four candidates are. What are the opinion polls telling us?
*17:31.980- 17:37.880* :  Well, it's too early to get a reliable picture of what Americans think now about Tim Walls,
*17:37.880- 17:43.220* :  the running mate for Kamala Harris. Those polls will, I guess, be being carried out as we speak.
*17:43.220- 17:47.940* :  And I expect the first substantive assessments on the state of play to be revealed probably
*17:47.940- 17:52.620* :  the weekend, most likely Sunday morning. But we know from very significant earlier polls,
*17:52.620- 17:57.580* :  suggesting that nine out of ten American adults didn't know enough about Governor Walls or
*17:57.580- 18:02.400* :  had no opinion about him. He isn't well known across the country. But I think more generally,
*18:02.400- 18:06.860* :  since Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden as the Democrats' choice of candidate,
*18:06.860- 18:12.620* :  the polls have certainly tightened considerably when they weigh her chances against Donald Trump,
*18:12.620- 18:18.080* :  who had managed to pull ahead beyond any margin of error when he was up against Joe Biden.
*18:18.080- 18:22.540* :  And we've got the Democratic Convention in a couple of weeks. And I think only then,
*18:22.580- 18:26.460* :  when the dust settles on the convention, we'll get a more realistic view from the polls.
*18:26.740- 18:32.320* :  Probably as we enter September, when traditionally Americans really begin to take notice of
*18:32.320- 18:37.200* :  the presidential campaign. Unorth America correspondent Peter Boes. We've been getting more
*18:37.200- 18:41.720* :  information today about a planned, extremist attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna.
*18:42.300- 18:47.180* :  Three forthcoming shows in the Austrian capital were cancelled on Wednesday after the plot was
*18:47.180- 18:52.600* :  revealed. At a news conference, the director of state security Omar Haijawi Pihakner said,
*18:52.600- 18:57.340* :  one of the attacker's aims was to kill himself and a large number of others outside the stadium
*18:57.340- 19:06.860* :  using explosives and stabbing weapons. You happen? We have recovered chemical substances,
*19:06.860- 19:13.920* :  liquids, explosive devices and technical equipment. The results of the investigation
*19:14.060- 19:21.540* :  showed that the precursor hydrogen peroxide, which is used to make explosives, was in use here.
*19:22.320- 19:29.700* :  And this explosive was also manufactured. The 19-year-old main perpetrator has since made a full
*19:29.700- 19:36.460* :  confession. The second man aged 17 has been arrested. There are also reports for 15-year-old
*19:36.460- 19:40.540* :  boy being detained. I've found out more from our correspondent in Vienna, Bethany Bell.
*19:41.720- 19:48.000* :  We just heard from the authorities that he has made a confession saying that he planned to
*19:48.340- 19:54.060* :  attack a crowd at the concert. It was a suicide attack. We understand that this was planned
*19:54.220- 20:00.700* :  and with the weapons that you just heard mentioned. And this, of course, was the reason why the
*20:00.720- 20:07.280* :  organizers decided to cancel the concerts here, much to the disappointment of the fans. And in fact,
*20:07.280- 20:12.880* :  I'm standing in a group of fans in the centre of Vienna right now, and there is a real sense of
*20:12.880- 20:19.300* :  disappointment. One group of girls from UK told me that they cried when they heard the news,
*20:19.820- 20:23.680* :  but they understood that safety had to come above everything.
*20:23.960- 20:28.160* :  Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, I'm taking my teenage daughter's seat, Taylor Swift in London
*20:28.160- 20:33.240* :  later this month. And if that gig that she'd been looking forward to were canceled, I'm trying
*20:33.240- 20:38.560* :  to imagine what that would be like. So there's obviously disappointment, as you say, but also
*20:38.960- 20:43.400* :  must be some degree of relief that this could have been a horrible situation if it had gone ahead.
*20:43.960- 20:49.520* :  So, bitly one girl told me that when she first heard the news about the arrests and the concert
*20:49.520- 20:53.980* :  was still planning to go ahead at that point, she said she was almost relieved when she heard
*20:53.980- 20:58.200* :  that it had been canceled because she was frightened. Other people, though, have said that they
*20:58.200- 21:03.320* :  have been waiting for this for such a long time. They've flown across the world. I've met
*21:03.460- 21:10.480* :  Americans here, we say that they came all the way from Oklahoma to being here, so enormous,
*21:10.480- 21:17.300* :  enormous disappointments. But now the fans have grouped here in Vienna, say that they'll keep on
*21:17.300- 21:24.680* :  celebrating and do what Taylor would do, which is the scene. Bethany Bell in Vienna. A new study in
*21:24.680- 21:30.020* :  the Netherlands, looking into how our brains work, has concluded that humans enjoy intense mental
*21:30.020- 21:35.320* :  effort much less than previously thought, even if the results are rewarding, and that more rewards
*21:35.320- 21:41.020* :  are needed to motivate people to achieve their goals. Victoria O'Hunder spoke to one of the authors
*21:41.020- 21:47.300* :  of the study, Alihana Vercena, from Radbad University. What inspired us in the beginning was that
*21:47.300- 21:53.240* :  intuitively we do have this anecdotal experience that sometimes, under certain circumstances,
*21:53.240- 22:00.300* :  we may actually enjoy engaging in difficult things, so things, for example, about doing crosswords
*22:00.300- 22:05.820* :  or suddok or plain chest, or even now that we are all watching the Olympics. Well, there's a pleats
*22:05.820- 22:12.260* :  where not only physical, but also taking a lot of planning and commitments, but there's an intuition
*22:12.260- 22:19.260* :  that while we may enjoy exerting efforts, that's exactly what we tested. Are there circumstances where
*22:19.260- 22:26.440* :  we do enjoy? And our results focus particularly on the feelings. They really said that this is not the
*22:26.440- 22:33.240* :  case. We actually do not enjoy it irrespective of what type of task we're doing or what's our background
*22:33.240- 22:39.020* :  or education level. It really looks like that no matter the circumstances, we actually always dislike
*22:39.020- 22:45.460* :  exerting mental efforts. So what does that then tell us about us humans and what we're able to do
*22:45.460- 22:51.920* :  and not to do? Yeah, I kind of tell us that actually motivation to achieve our goals is really
*22:51.920- 22:58.380* :  critical to get us going so that we are able to overcome these negative feelings that we experience
*22:58.380- 23:05.100* :  while we exert effort. As long as we care enough about what we can obtain in the end, the goal we
*23:05.100- 23:10.280* :  can achieve, whether we can get a reward for it or whether the experience we have as a consequence
*23:10.280- 23:16.920* :  is rewarding. So basically our end goal is what compensates for all the cost of the efforts
*23:16.920- 23:21.140* :  that goes into it while we're doing it. And pretty much that's what we're seeing at the Olympics
*23:21.140- 23:26.280* :  with all these people who spend their lifetimes getting to the goal of winning a medal.
*23:26.680- 23:31.520* :  Yeah, exactly. And I thought it was also quite interesting to see in these Olympics a lot of
*23:31.520- 23:37.220* :  attention given to athletes that perhaps didn't perform as well as they would have liked, but also
*23:37.220- 23:42.460* :  in interviews declared that they valued their accomplishments, which is really great
*23:42.460- 23:46.420* :  considering the amount of effort in that they put into such preparation and highlights that not
*23:46.420- 23:54.180* :  only a concrete consequence like a medal, but also, for example, self-confidence or being happy
*23:54.180- 24:00.100* :  with oneself. These are all things that can be rewarding. Aliana Vassena, now among the Olympians
*24:00.100- 24:04.680* :  hoping to get some enjoyment from their efforts are break dancers, or as they're professionally
*24:04.680- 24:09.920* :  called B-boys and B-girls. It's the first time the sport of breaking makes it into the Olympics.
*24:09.920- 24:15.620* :  The two-day competition begins on Friday and features athletes from more than a dozen countries.
*24:16.180- 24:20.820* :  Among them, 24-year-old B-girl El Muminy from Morocco, who as well as showing off her
*24:20.820- 24:26.200* :  breaking skills, is also hoping to inspire other women in the region. Nishat Ladder has the story.
*24:29.320- 24:34.680* :  You feel like the home workers are behind you and like, go, go, go, so this is an honor for me,
*24:34.680- 24:38.580* :  like to represent my country at the first time like breaking into the Olympics.
*24:41.040- 24:47.360* :  Meet Fatima Zara, also known as B-girl El Muminy. Her friends introduced her to breaking when she
*24:47.360- 24:53.880* :  was 15 and she hasn't looked back. We went to just a garden and we started to do some freezes
*24:54.380- 25:01.240* :  and then I was like, wow, I love this. As a Moroccan woman, a shy Fatima Zara came alive as
*25:01.240- 25:08.320* :  B-girl El Muminy, but she did encounter negativity even from her dad who still helped her financially.
*25:08.600- 25:14.160* :  I wanted to continue breaking and I was like, I need to show people that maybe the B-girls can do
*25:14.160- 25:20.240* :  this too. Women like in the Arab world, they just need to know like breaking, it's not a bad thing,
*25:20.360- 25:26.620* :  it's not something like shame because it's super good for you how to and then on the day of
*25:26.620- 25:32.120* :  the Olympic qualifiers, her dad was taken to hospital for surgery and everything changed.
*25:32.560- 25:37.520* :  I was really sad because I get this call at the same day of the African Championship and I was like,
*25:37.860- 25:42.760* :  can I dance and my dad is in the hospital and I was super sad and then he called me and he was like,
*25:42.800- 25:48.220* :  if you want me to be like in good health and he wants me to be happy, just do it and win it for me
*25:48.220- 25:53.660* :  and I did this for him actually. He was watching me at the hospital like life, so emotional.
*25:53.660- 25:59.380* :  I got this mid-eye and I went to him to the hospital and I was like, this is for you and he was
*25:59.380- 26:05.360* :  super happy. He said, my heart was about to stop when I saw you like in this competition and I was
*26:05.360- 26:12.740* :  so happy. B-girl El Muminy control inspiration from Selma Benani, president of the Moroccan
*26:12.740- 26:18.200* :  Federation which encompasses breaking and Benani is a huge advocate for women's sport.
*26:18.540- 26:23.480* :  Hip hop and breaking have been my fight since the founding of this federation. We are in Morocco.
*26:23.480- 26:29.320* :  The culture of hip hop comes from the USA exactly from the Bronx and it was born in the streets.
*26:29.320- 26:35.560* :  They created the battles. Battles means that they talk to each other through physical dance
*26:35.560- 26:41.720* :  and they express their feelings but they also express hope in life and that's why the slogan of
*26:41.720- 26:47.400* :  breaking is peace and love, that's something I love. So I'm not just proud, it's a war that I want.
*26:48.920- 26:55.360* :  We used to dance just following the rhythm and the freestyle in on beats but when it becomes
*26:55.360- 27:01.400* :  professional and go to the Olympics, a lot of things changed. Her coach Namo, known as B-boy
*27:01.400- 27:09.260* :  cow, is targeting the training. In focusing on execution, focusing on the flow, the form, the
*27:09.300- 27:16.640* :  shape of the moves, love things that would make a bigger or a B-boy reaching the level of the Olympics.
*27:17.960- 27:23.200* :  Olympic breaking will be staged at the Place de la Concorde in Paris where dancers will compete
*27:23.200- 27:29.700* :  in one-on-one battles to music picked by a DJ. Nine judges will vote at the end of each battle to
*27:29.700- 27:35.700* :  decide the champion and whether she wins a medal or not. One thing's for sure, B-girl El Muminy
*27:35.700- 27:41.660* :  is inspiring a new generation of dancers across the region. It's going to be a good impact in Morocco
*27:41.660- 27:46.840* :  because girls are so scared like to do breaking now because they will always like say the community
*27:46.840- 27:51.460* :  looking at us like that or like that so I guess it's going to be like a support for them.
*27:53.420- 27:58.760* :  We all hope to be in the podium but no matter what we're going to practice and we're going to
*27:58.980- 28:03.260* :  always say like eat the floor and practice because we are going to the Olympics.
*28:09.220- 28:13.000* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
