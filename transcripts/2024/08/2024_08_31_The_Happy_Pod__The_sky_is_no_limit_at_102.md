*01:40.500- 01:45.480* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in this edition, I was called as the cucumber sitting at the
*01:45.480- 01:50.540* :  between his knees in the face of a plane, but it's a bit different when you've come out the plane.
*01:51.960- 01:56.380* :  We meet the woman who's over a hundred but still jumped out of a plane for charity.
*01:56.380- 02:03.520* :  I relied on 15 years of competitive swimming to give me any advantage in a situation where I had not.
*02:04.100- 02:10.200* :  The Paralympian who got back in the water after being attacked by a shark and a modern composer
*02:10.200- 02:15.780* :  takes up a historic position within the British monarchy. What drives me is another
*02:15.780- 02:19.660* :  quenchable love of music and the first for knowledge for music.
*02:24.680- 02:30.180* :  We start here in the UK where Manette Bailey became the nation's oldest skydiver.
*02:30.680- 02:36.440* :  At the age of 102 years young, Manette did the dive to raise money for three charities
*02:37.060- 02:39.120* :  whilst also attempting to break records.
*02:39.800- 02:44.960* :  Now be her armoured, caught up with Manette and started by asking her what it felt like to jump
*02:44.960- 02:53.180* :  out of the plane. As you fall out the plane, the shock of the cold and the wind and you don't
*02:53.180- 02:58.720* :  know what position you're in, I thought I was sort of horizontal all the time and then I thought
*02:58.720- 03:03.780* :  no I couldn't have been because I started twisting around and I'm afraid I was too cowardly to
*03:03.780- 03:08.260* :  open my eyes straight away. I thought they would give me a double shock so I kept my eyes closed
*03:08.260- 03:13.960* :  until I got kind of used it and you are travelling at 130 miles an hour so if you're not keen
*03:13.960- 03:20.080* :  on speed, it's not a sport for you. I was reading about what your tandem for the skydiver said
*03:20.080- 03:26.320* :  and he said you were cool as a cucumber. I was cool as the cucumber sitting between his knees
*03:26.320- 03:32.640* :  in the face of a plane but there's a bit different when you come out the plane or you can say I was
*03:32.640- 03:40.520* :  cool as a cucumber when I landed gently on the ground and that was perfect and I did feel
*03:40.820- 03:45.860* :  perfectly calm. I thought no I'd get up, I got a Mac two men to help me get up and we walked
*03:45.860- 03:52.140* :  together to a lovely crowd cheering me on and waving and singing and goodness knows what
*03:52.140- 03:57.120* :  was lovely. I mean who wouldn't enjoy that. I mean it's so nice to kind of have that welcome
*03:57.120- 04:05.020* :  after you've done the skydiver. Before you jumped out how did you overcome those fears?
*04:05.300- 04:11.940* :  Well I've been through some nerve-wracking experiences in 102 years and I think positively all the
*04:11.940- 04:18.100* :  time that I want everyone else to do the same. I don't want you to be like me but I do I want
*04:18.100- 04:25.180* :  everyone to realise that how you're thinking really affects your whole life and don't give up
*04:25.180- 04:30.600* :  anything until you're forced to. I want that message to go through to all the people who are
*04:30.600- 04:36.780* :  going to their 80s and their 90s and are feeling slightly depressed about the whole affair. Just
*04:36.780- 04:42.740* :  think of something positive to do and think and enjoy your life as one man in the village said
*04:42.740- 04:49.600* :  simplicity and fun gets you to enjoy your old age. What's the secret to living a happy life?
*04:49.940- 04:55.920* :  There are lots of things that go towards this getting to 100. You've got to have made lots of
*04:55.920- 05:01.640* :  friends wherever you are to keep changing where you live. Keep making friends and you do that by
*05:01.640- 05:08.480* :  listening to them, inviting them to your house and your life will go along that line.
*05:08.960- 05:13.960* :  I know your husband was a paratrooper and your friend's 85-year-old dad did a skydiver himself.
*05:14.280- 05:19.400* :  Just tell me more about kind of seeing that fearlessness or that kind of thrill for adventure
*05:19.400- 05:25.160* :  around you and how has that inspired you? Well, another of my husband's ever-of-a-patient
*05:25.160- 05:32.060* :  with anyone who started their sentence, I can't. That was there. You just don't say you can't do
*05:32.060- 05:38.140* :  something. You can. Your mind to it. You can do it. And this is entertainment. I'm a great
*05:38.140- 05:44.720* :  one for entertainment. And of course, I admire my first husband for being quite the bravest
*05:44.720- 05:53.340* :  person. But I'm not given to nerves and I like thrills. What do you say to others about stepping
*05:53.340- 05:58.960* :  out of your comfort zone? I'm thinking I've got to really make the point that how you think is
*05:58.960- 06:05.200* :  very important is very much more important than you imagine. It affects your health and it
*06:05.200- 06:10.160* :  affects how you live. I reckon I was born with that part. I really do.
*06:10.740- 06:17.200* :  When it barely speaking to Nabiya Ahmed, the Paralympics got underway this week and the games are
*06:17.200- 06:22.800* :  not short of inspirational stories from all over the world. One of them is from the athlete
*06:22.800- 06:29.600* :  Ali Truett, who's competing in the swimming competition for team USA. Two days after Ali graduated
*06:29.600- 06:35.620* :  from university last year, she was attacked by a shark whilst swimming in the sea and had to have
*06:35.620- 06:42.080* :  her leg amputated below the knee as a result of her injuries. Ali had competed in swimming for many
*06:42.080- 06:46.800* :  years before the attack and was determined to get back into the sport she loved so much.
*06:47.240- 06:51.840* :  The happy pods Holly Gibbs has been finding out about Ali Truett's journey to Paris.
*06:52.840- 06:57.900* :  We were snorkeling in the ocean and seemingly out of nowhere a shark came up and started attacking
*06:57.940- 07:03.880* :  us and we fought back but pretty quickly it had my leg in its mouth and the next thing I knew it
*07:03.880- 07:13.120* :  had bitten off on my foot and part of my leg. Ali describing the moment she was attacked by a shark
*07:13.120- 07:19.120* :  whilst swimming in the sea on a trip to the Turks in Kekos Islands, an area not known for sharks.
*07:19.960- 07:25.260* :  Ali had just graduated from Yale University and competed in the swim team there. She had just
*07:25.300- 07:29.660* :  ran a marathon with her mother and was getting ready to start a consulting job in the following
*07:29.660- 07:34.720* :  months. It was a life or death situation so we screamed for help and when no help came we made
*07:34.720- 07:41.040* :  this split second decision to swim for our lives so we swam roughly 75 yards back to the boat
*07:41.160- 07:46.020* :  in the open ocean water. The shark actually came back a second time during that swim to the boat
*07:46.020- 07:51.780* :  but thankfully didn't bite either of us that time. You know I relied on 15 years of competitive swimming
*07:51.780- 07:57.560* :  to give me any advantage in a situation where I had none. Ali was airlifted to a hospital in Miami
*07:57.560- 08:03.380* :  for two bouts of surgery. After that she was airlifted again to a hospital in New York where she
*08:03.380- 08:09.820* :  underwent a below the knee amputation on her 23rd birthday. Ali was determined to get her life back
*08:09.820- 08:16.740* :  and to get back in water. She started in her family's pool in the back garden. Initially I realized
*08:16.740- 08:21.120* :  I was feeling really fearful of the water because at that point the last time I had heard the sound
*08:21.120- 08:26.600* :  of water I was swimming for my life but it was important for me to fight for the things that I
*08:26.600- 08:32.460* :  could reclaim because some of what I lost I'm never getting back and so I wanted to fight for what
*08:32.460- 08:37.520* :  I could get back and my love of the water was included in that. It wasn't all you know rainbows
*08:37.520- 08:42.900* :  butterflies it took a while to get back to that love of the water but I had glimmers of hope
*08:43.360- 08:48.160* :  moments where I felt like I was back to that peaceful and joyful feeling in the water that I've had
*08:48.160- 08:55.500* :  my whole life and enough glimmers of hope that I relied on hope to keep me going and the more I
*08:55.500- 09:01.820* :  worked at it the flashbacks reduced the pain lessened and I think I realized I could fight for that
*09:01.820- 09:08.180* :  love again. Now Ali is representing team USA at the Paralympics after getting back into competitive
*09:08.180- 09:13.620* :  swimming just three and a half months after her attack. In Paris she will be supported by around
*09:13.620- 09:18.840* :  50 of her family members who are making the trip to see her compete including her mother,
*09:18.840- 09:25.960* :  Jodie. She has those teary hard days and then she just pushes the reset button and stays focused
*09:25.960- 09:33.320* :  on her values which are getting happy, getting healthy and trying to be a you know contributing
*09:33.320- 09:39.380* :  member of society who puts good in the world that's that's her her main I think goal and purpose
*09:39.380- 09:44.480* :  and value in life and and the attack hasn't stopped her from trying to do that and makes us all
*09:44.480- 09:50.100* :  really proud. For Ali swimming has been her lifeline. I think that's the beautiful thing about
*09:50.100- 09:55.720* :  swimming for me and it's been a fight to get that love back but it saved my life in the moment
*09:55.720- 10:00.240* :  and it's continued to save my life as I work to rebuild it and given me strength and confidence
*10:00.240- 10:06.000* :  and hope and it's truly been one of the big things that's carried me through my recovery this
*10:06.000- 10:12.320* :  year and expedited my recovery in terms of self acceptance and my ability to feel strong again.
*10:12.780- 10:19.960* :  Ali Truitt ending that report by Holly Gibbs. A woman born in Belize in Central America and then
*10:19.960- 10:25.260* :  raised in a deprived part of the UK has been appointed to one of the most coveted cultural
*10:25.260- 10:32.280* :  positions within the Royal Household Master of the King's Music. Composer and singer-songwriter
*10:32.280- 10:37.780* :  Erelyn Wallen has already created some of the most performed pieces of music among living
*10:37.780- 10:45.140* :  composers including 22 operas. She's also written compositions for the Golden and Diamond Jubilies
*10:45.140- 10:51.780* :  of the late Queen Elizabeth II but she says it's her boundless enthusiasm for making music
*10:52.220- 10:55.380* :  that won her the new role at the heart of the British establishment.
*11:12.660- 11:18.460* :  A taste of her work there. Stephanie Prentice caught up with Erelyn Wallen and asked her about the
*11:18.460- 11:24.500* :  day she was told she had a new job. Well I was in shock but it didn't take me long to say yes
*11:24.500- 11:31.680* :  very enthusiastically and in fact it's still sinking in. It's an extremely grand title Master
*11:31.680- 11:36.300* :  of the King's Music. How would you describe it to somebody listening who might not know what
*11:36.300- 11:42.760* :  that means? Well I would say it's it's a historic title which sort of derives from the early days
*11:42.760- 11:49.740* :  where the monarch and we go back to the 17th century appointed a musician. So it's evolved over
*11:49.740- 11:55.980* :  the years till I suppose in the last hundred years the Master can have an advisory role as well.
*11:55.980- 12:02.000* :  We can be on hand to write for special state occasions and now I'm yet to have an audience with
*12:02.000- 12:09.300* :  the King but what why I'm so excited is that he is truly musical he plays the cello and I believe
*12:09.300- 12:14.460* :  he might even compose. How do you think you might feel when you do come face to face with the
*12:14.460- 12:21.480* :  King? I'm hoping that my natural sort of bubbly enthusiasm will will come out but what I love about
*12:21.480- 12:27.680* :  music the moment you start talking about something you're that you love it's as if all the nervousness
*12:27.680- 12:34.020* :  goes away when I'm talking about music I feel always very happy. So as I understand it you're the
*12:34.020- 12:40.600* :  second woman and the first person of color in this role how does it feel to be advancing
*12:40.600- 12:46.200* :  representation in two areas at once? Well I mean I've been doing it since I was a little girl.
*12:46.520- 12:50.660* :  Once I showed a strong interest in classical music certainly there were some people who
*12:51.160- 12:55.600* :  you know teachers included who felt this music wasn't for me so I quickly got used to being
*12:55.600- 13:02.040* :  maybe the only that person in the room maybe out of hundreds of people in the room. What drives me
*13:02.040- 13:09.840* :  is an unquenchable love of music and the first for knowledge for music and that's I think to be
*13:09.840- 13:15.660* :  honest that's why I've probably been selected. You have spoken the past about wanting children to
*13:15.660- 13:20.640* :  learn to write music which you do when you're at school why do you think it really benefits children?
*13:21.640- 13:29.060* :  I think to be human is to make music to be around music and I feel that I have been privileged
*13:29.060- 13:35.600* :  to get to where I am because I started off with free access to music. Many of us from
*13:36.020- 13:41.580* :  quite poor backgrounds we have this marvelous teacher Miss Biel who taught us to read
*13:41.580- 13:47.620* :  about music. You have mentioned that music is where you feel the happiest but could you give us a
*13:47.660- 13:52.540* :  song or a piece of music you'd recommend if people really want to just get a little happy hit?
*13:53.820- 14:00.300* :  Well at the moment at the moment I can't stop listening to Stevie Wonder's Sign Seal Delivered.
*14:07.140- 14:14.220* :  And that's a very popular tune but the thing is I as a composer I keep listening to sort of see
*14:14.220- 14:20.380* :  what the basic electric bass is doing over the tub of that there's a push and pull in Stevie Wonder's
*14:20.380- 14:26.920* :  voice and that's what gives the song it's real it's laid back but at the same time makes you want
*14:26.920- 14:31.660* :  to dance. So we could get a reworked Sign Seal Delivered at the next major royal event.
*14:33.280- 14:34.760* :  Well don't put it whilst me.
*14:36.680- 14:39.280* :  Marilyn Walland speaking to Stephanie Prentice.
*14:43.980- 14:52.220* :  Coming up in this podcast it took me four months of physical therapy to be able to touch the
*14:52.260- 14:59.180* :  palm with my fingers is not 100% healed but again still use it. I feel a little tingling but I'm
*14:59.180- 15:06.900* :  happy. A man buried under an avalanche in northern Italy for almost 24 hours has made an incredible
*15:07.460- 15:09.480* :  recovery both emotionally and physically.

*16:20.020- 16:24.860* :  To Stockholm now where next month players from around the world will be gathering for the second
*16:24.860- 16:31.720* :  annual GeoGuessor World Cup. It's an online game based on Google Street View where players have
*16:31.720- 16:36.980* :  to use visual clues to work out where in the world they are. But players have also been
*16:36.980- 16:41.860* :  finding other uses for their GeoGuessing skills as Harry Bly has been finding out.
*16:42.640- 16:48.700* :  GeoGuessor began in 2012 and the concept is simple. You're dropped in a random location
*16:48.700- 16:54.480* :  and have to work out where you are just by using geographical clues in the surroundings.
*16:54.480- 16:58.420* :  And your goal is to use whatever picture you see and guess where you are.
*16:58.620- 17:04.420* :  This is GeoGuessor Player Gavin ATAC or better known as Chicago Geographer. That's my GeoGuessor
*17:04.420- 17:09.420* :  user name. I've been playing the game for about seven years now and I'm going to be participating
*17:09.420- 17:13.620* :  in the GeoGuessor World Cup this September. I played in the one last year as well.
*17:13.620- 17:17.240* :  You guys are closer look at this match now. It's going to be between the story players,
*17:17.580- 17:19.640* :  Jake Lyons and Chicago Geographer.
*17:19.820- 17:23.800* :  See you taking the advice and just going center here and we might see a similar thing here by Jake.
*17:24.180- 17:29.040* :  Gavin is one of 24 players in this year's World Cup and here's how it works.
*17:29.760- 17:34.760* :  Two players will see the same location and have 60 seconds to guess where they are.
*17:35.320- 17:40.140* :  If one player guesses early, the opponent has 15 seconds to submit their guess.
*17:40.920- 17:43.360* :  Whoever's closest wins the most points.
*17:43.360- 17:47.840* :  It's Jake and Jake now tapping the head, looking into lense thing.
*17:47.840- 17:51.940* :  The competition is always so fierce and I think this year it's even stronger.
*17:51.940- 17:55.020* :  You know people have discovered the game more from watching it last year.
*17:55.160- 17:57.620* :  I'm going to just bite my hardest and that's all I can do.
*17:57.980- 18:03.140* :  One of this year's commentators is a man who's made an entire career from playing
*18:03.140- 18:05.480* :  and mastering GeoGuessor.
*18:05.600- 18:08.880* :  All right it's another day to play the game of GeoGuessor and it's another day.
*18:08.880- 18:14.560* :  This is Trevor Rainbolt and will be what's known as a caster at this year's competition known
*18:14.560- 18:21.000* :  online as just Rainbolt. Trevor is originally from Arkansas and has no formal background in geography.
*18:21.520- 18:22.640* :  I'm coming from the exact opposite.
*18:23.400- 18:26.740* :  I actually was like a very below average person geography.
*18:27.300- 18:31.860* :  But that hasn't stopped him becoming one of the world's most popular GeoGuessors
*18:31.860- 18:37.060* :  with more than two million subscribers across his two YouTube channels and just under
*18:37.140- 18:38.960* :  three million followers on TikTok.
*18:39.720- 18:42.940* :  The art of GeoGuessor, Rainbolt says, is memorization.
*18:42.940- 18:45.540* :  Each country has unique features.
*18:45.960- 18:50.440* :  It could be something niche, the color or shape of the road signs or telephone poles.
*18:50.900- 18:55.920* :  The distinctive look of road markings or a species of tree commonly found somewhere
*18:56.360- 19:01.340* :  or if you're lucky something more obvious like a shopfront with the name of the town on it.
*19:01.840- 19:06.900* :  And with his online fame Trevor has found another purpose using the knowledge and skills
*19:06.900- 19:09.440* :  he's acquired from playing GeoGuessor.
*19:09.780- 19:13.980* :  Helping people work out the location in which old photos were taken.
*19:14.400- 19:17.500* :  I got sent this DM once and I was like wait a second, I know where that is.
*19:17.780- 19:21.880* :  It was like someone that really need help finding a photo of their biological mother
*19:22.140- 19:24.220* :  and I was like wait, this has like real life impact.
*19:24.220- 19:28.380* :  Like the skill that I learned to be competitive against other players my free time
*19:28.380- 19:32.140* :  has a transferable skill that actually is able to help people.
*19:32.540- 19:36.740* :  Trevor receives messages from fans all over the world asking for his help
*19:37.140- 19:40.340* :  to track down where old photos of their loved ones were taken.
*19:40.600- 19:46.980* :  But sometimes it's hours and days and weeks and months and sometimes even years.
*19:47.700- 19:50.140* :  There's one I'm working on right now that I've had since 2022.
*19:50.820- 19:52.160* :  Wow, it's all fun though.
*19:52.600- 19:55.180* :  The hours you find you spend trying to find something
*19:55.960- 19:57.540* :  become all worth it in a one single moment.
*19:57.860- 20:02.080* :  In a sense it still is a game but it's a game with a bigger reward at the end.
*20:02.620- 20:06.160* :  It's like you actually have an impact in someone and like their their life and that's
*20:06.280- 20:08.460* :  really better than getting some some internet points.
*20:09.280- 20:10.320* :  Harry Blie reporting.
*20:11.180- 20:15.280* :  Back to the Paralympics now I've been diving into the sporting archives
*20:15.880- 20:20.720* :  and this week we've chosen a woman who's won medals at both the summer and winter games
*20:20.720- 20:26.280* :  in cross country skiing by Athlon, rowing and hand cycling in which she took two
*20:26.280- 20:27.380* :  goals in Tokyo.
*20:28.060- 20:33.320* :  Oxana Masters was born in Ukraine three years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster
*20:33.920- 20:37.440* :  and the radiation is thought to have contributed to what she describes as
*20:37.440- 20:41.220* :  significant birth defects to her limbs and some of her organs.
*20:41.340- 20:46.160* :  She was adopted by her American mother, Gay Masters and moved to the US
*20:46.720- 20:50.460* :  where she had her legs amputated to improve her quality of life.
*20:51.220- 20:55.540* :  Speaking to Scout Bassett and Ed Harry before the 2020 Tokyo games,
*20:55.920- 21:01.300* :  she explained how she managed to win her first winter Paralympic gold with a broken elbow.
*21:02.100- 21:05.680* :  Honestly it's the first time I actually believe in myself going into a games.
*21:06.400- 21:11.440* :  I wasn't going to let my elbow determine all four years of training.
*21:12.220- 21:15.420* :  I'm already missing two legs. What's another arm at the end of the day?
*21:17.020- 21:22.180* :  And I definitely think everything we go through in life, we don't know at that moment,
*21:22.180- 21:26.020* :  but we have no idea every good experience, bad experience,
*21:27.140- 21:28.700* :  the moments where it's the end of the world.
*21:29.140- 21:32.340* :  It's truly preparing you for something you just don't know yet,
*21:32.560- 21:37.060* :  but when that moment comes you're going to be ready for it and instinctively know what to do.
*21:37.360- 21:41.640* :  For people who weren't familiar, what was life like in the orphanage?
*21:43.880- 21:50.440* :  When my mom adopted me when I was turning 8, I was 36 inches tall and weighed 34 pounds.
*21:51.360- 21:54.040* :  I lived in three different orphanages before I was adopted.
*21:54.900- 22:00.260* :  I won't bore you with the details, but yeah, it was not good.
*22:00.900- 22:07.360* :  And I think it's why I love sports. It became, I was such an angry, angry, explosive child
*22:07.360- 22:13.500* :  and didn't have anywhere to release that energy. It became my outlet.
*22:13.680- 22:19.920* :  It became, and so like even when I ski or ride a bike, like I will sometimes zone into those
*22:19.940- 22:23.080* :  moments of flashback into Ukraine a little bit.
*22:23.840- 22:29.720* :  When did your mom first talk to you? And I'm wondering what the process was like from her side,
*22:29.720- 22:35.760* :  whether she met other barriers and resistance that she had to overcome to make this whole happen?
*22:36.100- 22:39.860* :  Oh my gosh, my mom went through, my mom adopted me single parent.
*22:40.220- 22:42.700* :  She was questioned, why was she single?
*22:43.120- 22:46.140* :  What mental disorder did she have? Why is she not married?
*22:46.140- 22:51.020* :  What is wrong with her? I mean, I went home my whole entire life and everything to her because
*22:52.000- 22:57.660* :  I think it took special people to choose to adopt and I got very lucky that my mom had the heart
*22:57.660- 23:00.840* :  that she had and the fight that she had. We could not be any more different.
*23:00.840- 23:03.300* :  Like she's not an athlete, she does not like sports.
*23:03.680- 23:08.460* :  It's my mom determination that fight that taught me how to fight as an athlete and apply it in
*23:08.460- 23:14.340* :  so many different areas I feel like. When I had my leg amputated and was forced to amputate my legs,
*23:15.540- 23:19.800* :  I didn't know what was next for me because I never saw anyone like me.
*23:20.120- 23:23.700* :  And so I didn't know sports was even out there that I could have this outlet or
*23:24.400- 23:26.380* :  something for me to get excited and look forward to.
*23:27.020- 23:32.580* :  You have to make it more visible to make it more normal because you're never going to know
*23:32.580- 23:37.640* :  like what little boy is going to look at that picture. I'm like, oh my gosh, she has the same
*23:37.640- 23:42.500* :  leg as I do. Oh, they have the same wheelchair. I have crutches, she has crutches and they can
*23:42.500- 23:51.720* :  be it when you see it. And this took me every single minute of my 31 years to be able to
*23:53.040- 24:01.460* :  smile without my prosthetics on and to post it publicly. And my favorite quote is by Coco Chanel.
*24:01.460- 24:07.460* :  And to be irreplaceable, one must always be different. And I'll be honest, I still struggle with
*24:07.460- 24:13.240* :  this. I still there days where I'm like, why can I be this? But you can't truly love the world
*24:13.240- 24:19.740* :  and embrace every opportunity that comes to you if you don't love yourself. Embrace what sets
*24:19.740- 24:23.920* :  you apart because it's making it irreplaceable at the end of the day. You know, I think this is
*24:23.920- 24:29.460* :  something people struggle with, you know, body image. What helped you to get to a place of
*24:30.140- 24:35.360* :  acceptance, of self love? So what helped you to sort across that bridge?
*24:35.780- 24:41.680* :  It's going to be different for everybody because for me, that bridge was sports, but it can be
*24:42.220- 24:47.780* :  whatever wherever their passion is. Instead of getting defeated by your failure, it just
*24:47.780- 24:53.280* :  motivates me to be like, I know I can do it. There's moments of doubt. There's a there's a fine
*24:53.280- 25:00.220* :  line of doubting yourself, but doubting it too much because a little bit of doubt is that little spark
*25:00.220- 25:06.260* :  of fire that's going to light the flame, but then you going and putting in those hours and
*25:06.260- 25:10.680* :  believing in yourself, that's what's going to make the flame come alive. And you can hear more from
*25:10.680- 25:16.900* :  Oxana and many other Olympic and Paralympic champions in on the podium wherever you get your BBC
*25:16.900- 25:25.160* :  podcasts. Now to a remarkable story of survival and recovery. In January last year, Carluccio
*25:25.160- 25:30.900* :  Santori was buried under an avalanche while skiing in the Dolomite mountains in Northern Italy.
*25:31.480- 25:37.080* :  He spent almost 24 hours under the snow in the valley of Alta Badia before being rescued,
*25:37.760- 25:43.840* :  but he's now made such a good recovery physically and emotionally that he's been able to go skiing
*25:43.840- 25:47.720* :  again. Joseph Kotagia has been hearing his story.
*25:48.480- 25:53.980* :  Rescuers hovered over the mountains in a helicopter for hours, hoping to locate the 53-year-old
*25:53.980- 26:01.620* :  from Rovigo, a city in the Veneto region. After 23 hours at an altitude of 2,300 meters above sea level,
*26:01.620- 26:07.560* :  they spotted an unglaught hand jutting out of the snow. Rescuers meticulously dug out the snow
*26:07.560- 26:13.320* :  around Carluccio and found him alive but unconscious, severe hypothermic and suffering from life
*26:13.320- 26:19.660* :  threatening frostbite. Carluccio was flown to a hospital in nearby Bolzana and rushed to intensive care.
*26:19.940- 26:25.100* :  Miraculously, Carluccio recovered and was even spared amputation of his unglaught hand.
*26:25.100- 26:30.400* :  18 months since the ordeal, Carluccio has been reflecting on his long road to recovery.
*26:30.400- 26:36.020* :  I don't think I've got to walk the wrong way. It took me four months of physical therapy to be
*26:36.020- 26:42.720* :  able to touch the palm with my fingers. After four months of exercises, I was able to close my hand.
*26:44.180- 26:49.700* :  Carluccio says that he's happy how his health has progressed but his hand hasn't completely recovered.
*26:52.480- 26:58.820* :  My damaged hand is not 100% healed but I can still use it. I can no longer close it completely.
*26:59.400- 27:05.360* :  I have a strong sensitivity to cold so I suffer a lot from the cold. I feel a little tingling but
*27:05.360- 27:11.080* :  I'm happy. He recalled his psychological battle in overcoming this bad experience.
*27:15.720- 27:18.960* :  I won't deny that for six or seven months after the accident,
*27:18.960- 27:24.840* :  it almost bothered me to see images of mountains with snow. It was something that made me
*27:24.840- 27:30.140* :  immediately go back to that moment of trauma and for almost a year there wasn't a day,
*27:30.140- 27:34.400* :  especially when I went to bed that I didn't think back to that moment.
*27:36.580- 27:41.080* :  But Carluccio doesn't want fear to beat him and he's determined to go back on the slopes.
*27:50.060- 27:54.020* :  The doctors who treated Carluccio said they had never seen a patient who had been trapped
*27:54.020- 27:58.800* :  under the snow for that long but are delighted with his recovery. Dr. Luca Moroder,
*27:58.800- 28:03.900* :  part of the team who treated Carluccio. It's a good feeling. It's a good feeling because
*28:04.860- 28:14.280* :  you see that the treatment you choose was the correct one and that you had the possibility to
*28:14.280- 28:21.320* :  save the extremity of a patient which had this problem but also other severe problems.
*28:21.560- 28:26.420* :  For Carluccio who even went skiing with one of the rescuers, the rescuers are his angels.
*28:28.540- 28:34.440* :  I will never forget them. We talk and they were very kind. They took care of me. I couldn't
*28:34.440- 28:39.720* :  ask for better. They were truly my angels. I think I will never forget them.
*28:41.500- 28:47.100* :  Carluccio Santori ending that report from Joseph Cutterger and that's all from the happy
*28:47.100- 28:51.820* :  pod for now. This edition was mixed by Philip Ball and the producer was Holly Gibbs.
