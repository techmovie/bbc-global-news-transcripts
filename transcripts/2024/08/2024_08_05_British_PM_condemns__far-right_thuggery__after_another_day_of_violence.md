*01:24.000- 01:26.080* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and in the early hours of Monday,
*01:26.080- 01:28.420* :  the 5th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:29.080- 01:32.020* :  The British Prime Minister, Kia Starmer, has condemned violence
*01:32.020- 01:36.080* :  in several towns and cities across the country as far-right fuckery.
*01:36.680- 01:41.180* :  An indefinite curfew is enforced across Bangladesh after 90 people were killed
*01:41.180- 01:42.660* :  in anti-government protests.
*01:43.480- 01:46.600* :  And it's ready air strike as it two schools in Gaza City,
*01:46.860- 01:47.920* :  killing a number of people.
*01:49.860- 01:50.700* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:51.300- 01:51.800* :  Hi everybody!
*01:52.520- 01:56.980* :  Today we are going to learn how to make Korean traditional kimchi.
*01:56.980- 01:59.920* :  In Korean it's called hogi kimchi.
*02:00.380- 02:04.420* :  New figures show that kimchi, the traditional Korean side dish consisting of
*02:04.420- 02:08.440* :  salted and fermented vegetables, is growing in popularity around the world.
*02:11.440- 02:15.880* :  Let's begin in the UK where riots and unrest are continuing around the country.
*02:21.420- 02:26.340* :  That's the sound of protesters outside a hotel in
*02:26.340- 02:29.640* :  rather than in Northern England, used to house asylum seekers.
*02:29.640- 02:32.480* :  A bin was set ablaze there and forced through a window.
*02:33.100- 02:36.480* :  These violent protests began on Tuesday after three young girls
*02:36.480- 02:38.980* :  were stabbed to death in the town of Southport.
*02:39.480- 02:42.860* :  Online rumors incorrectly blaming the killings on a migrant.
*02:43.500- 02:46.380* :  Speaking at Downing Street, the British Prime Minister, Kia Starmer,
*02:46.680- 02:49.520* :  said those involved would feel the full force of the law.
*02:50.340- 02:52.520* :  We've seen Muslim communities targeted.
*02:53.220- 02:54.660* :  Attacks on mosques.
*02:55.060- 02:57.200* :  Other minority communities singled out.
*02:57.780- 02:59.380* :  Nazi salutes in the street.
*02:59.960- 03:01.120* :  Attacks on the police.
*03:01.820- 03:04.700* :  Wanton violence alongside racist rhetoric.
*03:05.260- 03:08.740* :  So no, I won't shy away from calling it what it is.
*03:09.500- 03:10.940* :  Far right, thuggery.
*03:11.440- 03:12.780* :  So what led up to all this?
*03:12.780- 03:16.020* :  I've been talking to our UK political correspondent Rob Watson.
*03:16.560- 03:21.240* :  The immediate trigger was the murder of three small girls on Monday
*03:21.240- 03:25.140* :  in a place just outside of Liverpool in the northwest of England.
*03:25.380- 03:27.680* :  And within minutes of those murders,
*03:27.680- 03:31.560* :  there was disinformation put about that the suspect was
*03:31.720- 03:35.180* :  an asylum seeker, that this asylum seeker was a Muslim
*03:35.180- 03:38.380* :  and had been on an intelligence watch list.
*03:38.380- 03:40.040* :  Now none of that was true.
*03:40.040- 03:45.620* :  But within hours of that we saw anti-immigrant riots in that area.
*03:46.080- 03:49.680* :  And those riots have subsequently spread to other citizens in the north
*03:49.700- 03:51.200* :  and indeed to all parts.
*03:51.240- 03:52.780* :  So many parts, the country, Andrew.
*03:53.560- 03:56.900* :  And I mean, the logic that says some children have been killed.
*03:56.900- 04:01.100* :  I must therefore attack a police officer and set the police car on fire.
*04:01.580- 04:02.840* :  Defies me, it has to be said.
*04:02.840- 04:06.220* :  But promise to Kirstoff has been trying to address this today.
*04:06.220- 04:07.260* :  What's he going to do about it?
*04:07.660- 04:11.020* :  Well, he's treating it very much as a law and order issue.
*04:11.020- 04:13.740* :  In other words, this is not some political problem to solve.
*04:13.740- 04:17.200* :  That this is right wing thuggery, that it's racism
*04:17.320- 04:19.020* :  and it's up to the authorities.
*04:19.020- 04:21.480* :  That's the state and the police to get a grip.
*04:21.480- 04:26.400* :  And that point that you raise, that you find it hard to follow that chain of events.
*04:26.400- 04:29.620* :  Why on earth would someone, why would people write the way they have
*04:29.620- 04:31.420* :  after the murder of three school girls?
*04:31.420- 04:34.440* :  I mean, what they would say, and this isn't justification.
*04:34.580- 04:37.240* :  But I'm saying the kind of things you pick up on social media
*04:37.860- 04:40.780* :  is a sort of a grievance among some of those rioting.
*04:40.780- 04:42.940* :  They take the view that the police and the state
*04:43.440- 04:47.420* :  tread on eggshells when it comes to misdemeanors by people are not white.
*04:47.420- 04:50.440* :  But through the full force of the law, people are white.
*04:50.440- 04:53.380* :  Of course, the police and state would say that's utter nonsense,
*04:53.920- 04:55.480* :  but that's part of what's going on.
*04:55.800- 05:00.560* :  And also a sense that this far right movement, if that's not too strong a term
*05:00.560- 05:03.140* :  for it has been building in Britain for some years.
*05:03.140- 05:05.200* :  We've had senior police officers saying today,
*05:05.680- 05:08.440* :  actually, we were warning about this kind of thing as early as 2017.
*05:08.440- 05:10.380* :  It's just coming to fruition now.
*05:10.680- 05:13.680* :  Yes, I mean, I guess you'd have to distinguish between two things.
*05:13.680- 05:17.740* :  And there are those on the populist right and indeed
*05:18.240- 05:22.420* :  across the political spectrum who say Britain has has astonishingly high levels
*05:22.420- 05:26.580* :  of net migration these last 20 years or so.
*05:26.580- 05:28.380* :  And that has clearly created issues.
*05:28.380- 05:31.760* :  But there's a distinction between that and the kind of people,
*05:31.760- 05:34.840* :  the kind of riots that we've seen where people are clearly motivated
*05:34.840- 05:35.980* :  in part by racism.
*05:36.040- 05:40.220* :  But there's no doubt, Andrea, an immensely serious and difficult moment for Britain.
*05:40.740- 05:42.620* :  A correspondent Rob Watson with me.
*05:43.140- 05:46.860* :  Next, we go to Bangladesh, where more than 90 people have been killed
*05:46.900- 05:48.900* :  in some of the worst violence in decades.
*05:56.500- 05:59.020* :  Doesn't this more were hurt during clashes between police
*05:59.020- 06:00.740* :  and anti-government demonstrators?
*06:01.120- 06:03.940* :  At least a dozen police were among those killed on Sunday.
*06:04.660- 06:08.400* :  What began last month as protests against civil service job quotas
*06:08.400- 06:10.800* :  is now hardened into a demand for the Prime Minister,
*06:10.800- 06:12.100* :  Sheikh Hasina, to go.
*06:12.760- 06:15.440* :  One of them is Hasni Nojisti, a law student
*06:15.440- 06:17.840* :  who's been taking part in the protests in Dhaka.
*06:18.320- 06:19.880* :  His comment here has been voiced over
*06:20.180- 06:21.820* :  because of the poor quality of the phone line.
*06:22.620- 06:26.980* :  Not only we, the whole nation is wanting her to step down
*06:27.380- 06:31.640* :  because there have been protests all over the country since July 18.
*06:32.220- 06:35.120* :  We are protesting in demand of one point.
*06:35.640- 06:37.400* :  Previously, there were nine.
*06:37.760- 06:42.580* :  But now we're making it one, because if one point is successful,
*06:43.080- 06:44.520* :  we will have our nine points.
*06:45.320- 06:49.040* :  Student leaders, of course, for a campaign of disobedience against the government,
*06:49.040- 06:52.080* :  urging people not to pay taxes or utility bills.
*06:52.640- 06:54.700* :  And it's all Huck, Bangladesh's law minister,
*06:55.060- 06:57.180* :  gave his assessment of Sunday's violence.
*06:58.020- 07:01.960* :  This movement was done by certain political parties,
*07:01.960- 07:05.900* :  but they had put the children in hunt as human shields.
*07:05.900- 07:07.920* :  We did not take action against them.
*07:08.260- 07:12.040* :  Now, militant activists of Yamati, Islam,
*07:12.340- 07:15.380* :  the banned political party and BNP are on the streets,
*07:15.380- 07:18.080* :  destroying public property, private property,
*07:18.440- 07:19.680* :  without any instigation.
*07:19.940- 07:21.660* :  If we had not shown restraint,
*07:22.160- 07:23.680* :  then there would be a platform.
*07:24.460- 07:25.920* :  I've been speaking to our South Asia,
*07:25.920- 07:28.020* :  regional editor and barrison, Etha Rajan,
*07:28.240- 07:30.920* :  and Mia Sabir, the head of the BBC's Ben Goli service,
*07:30.920- 07:34.640* :  who gave me an update from Dhaka and more details regarding the fatalities.
*07:35.460- 07:37.540* :  The numbers are likely to increase,
*07:38.240- 07:39.420* :  and despite the curfew,
*07:39.660- 07:42.380* :  we are getting reports of clashes in different parts of the country.
*07:43.060- 07:46.460* :  And it was only the first day of total non-cooperation movement
*07:46.460- 07:48.100* :  by the student protestors,
*07:48.700- 07:50.760* :  and they also have called for a long march
*07:51.000- 07:52.060* :  towards the capital Dhaka.
*07:52.640- 07:53.720* :  Their demand is very clear.
*07:54.220- 07:56.760* :  They are saying that the protestors are not about the quota anymore,
*07:56.760- 07:59.600* :  and they want the government headed by the Prime Minister,
*07:59.600- 08:01.020* :  Sheikh Hasina to a step down,
*08:01.500- 08:03.620* :  and they won't stop until they succeed.
*08:04.180- 08:05.700* :  And in barrison, let me just ask you,
*08:05.700- 08:07.900* :  what's the license that you're picking up from your sources?
*08:08.260- 08:11.740* :  Now, the situation is really tense across Bangladesh.
*08:11.920- 08:14.160* :  The country is at a crossroads,
*08:14.560- 08:17.400* :  because you have thousands of people on the streets,
*08:18.220- 08:19.640* :  clashing with security forces,
*08:19.640- 08:23.160* :  and also you have the supporters of the Awami League,
*08:23.160- 08:24.560* :  also out on the streets.
*08:25.100- 08:27.580* :  They are also clashing with protestors now.
*08:28.260- 08:31.080* :  The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina's firmly ruled out
*08:31.080- 08:32.780* :  resigning. In fact, she came out
*08:32.780- 08:35.120* :  with a very defined statement saying that
*08:35.760- 08:38.160* :  those who were on the streets were not students,
*08:39.220- 08:40.820* :  what she described as terrorists,
*08:41.400- 08:42.960* :  how to destabilize the nation.
*08:43.200- 08:45.200* :  Now, the whole thing is now depending on
*08:45.200- 08:47.480* :  what the Bangladesh Army will do,
*08:47.980- 08:50.860* :  which has a considerable influence in the country.
*08:51.380- 08:52.720* :  If the situation continues,
*08:52.720- 08:56.480* :  at some point there will be a lot of pressure on the Army to do something.
*08:57.340- 08:59.780* :  May the Bangladesh-Yi Law Minister has told the BBC
*08:59.780- 09:02.060* :  that the government is showing great restraint,
*09:02.060- 09:04.400* :  and that's why there isn't more of a bloodbath.
*09:04.400- 09:05.280* :  What do you make of that?
*09:05.700- 09:07.780* :  This is what the government has said before as well,
*09:07.780- 09:12.780* :  but what we have seen today was not really restrained as he calls it,
*09:13.200- 09:14.400* :  at least not from their party.
*09:15.160- 09:17.640* :  So, of course, things can always get worse,
*09:18.160- 09:20.120* :  but there has already been a bloodbath,
*09:20.680- 09:24.680* :  and restraint doesn't seem like a credible defense in this case.
*09:24.960- 09:27.460* :  And then, Barossa and Sheikh Hasina sounding defiant,
*09:27.620- 09:29.720* :  certainly not like a leader who's about to step down.
*09:30.520- 09:35.180* :  She is, because she still believes that she has already accepted the demands
*09:35.180- 09:39.360* :  by the students, and they should go back to the universities and stop protesting,
*09:40.120- 09:45.100* :  but it's not clear how much she knows about the protest going across the country.
*09:45.100- 09:47.800* :  Now, if anything has to happen within Bangladesh,
*09:47.800- 09:50.900* :  there is one internal factor, that is the Bangladesh Army.
*09:50.900- 09:54.160* :  The other one is India, the neighboring country,
*09:54.160- 09:57.060* :  which has considerable amount of influence in Bangladesh.
*09:57.780- 10:02.500* :  And Sheikh Hasina has always seen as a very pro-India, very friendly towards Delhi.
*10:03.080- 10:06.900* :  So, Delhi would want to see Sheikh Hasina to continue in power.
*10:07.520- 10:09.840* :  But again, Sheikh Hasina is a veteran politician.
*10:09.920- 10:11.920* :  She has been in politics for decades,
*10:12.560- 10:14.500* :  and she has gone through various protests,
*10:15.220- 10:17.560* :  and also several assassination attempts.
*10:17.560- 10:20.860* :  She's not the someone who can give in so easily,
*10:21.560- 10:24.220* :  and you see the statements from her today.
*10:24.220- 10:28.300* :  It clearly shows that she is not going to listen to the protestors demand.
*10:29.060- 10:31.800* :  Ambarassan Ethorajan and Amir Sabir in Dhaka.
*10:32.800- 10:35.020* :  Saudi Arabia has joined a growing number of countries,
*10:35.020- 10:40.420* :  including France, the US and the UK, urging their citizens to leave Lebanon immediately,
*10:40.420- 10:44.320* :  amid fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah.
*10:44.960- 10:49.240* :  The Saudi embassy in Beirut said it was closely monitoring the situation in southern Lebanon,
*10:49.240- 10:52.780* :  along the border with Israel, where Hezbollah and the Israeli military
*10:52.780- 10:56.100* :  were engaged in an exchange of fire earlier on Sunday.
*10:56.860- 11:00.800* :  Israel intercepted most of the Hezbollah rockets, but the countries on high alert
*11:01.260- 11:03.520* :  in anticipation of a broader regional conflict.
*11:04.140- 11:06.860* :  Iran and its regional allies pledged retaliation
*11:06.860- 11:11.100* :  for the assassination of the Hamas political chief Ismar Haneer in Tehran,
*11:11.100- 11:13.520* :  and also Hezbollah commander in Beirut.
*11:14.020- 11:18.260* :  I've been finding out more from our Middle East correspondent, Hugo Vashager, who's in Beirut.
*11:18.980- 11:24.140* :  There's only one commercial airport in the country, which is the airport here in Beirut,
*11:24.140- 11:29.720* :  and flights have been cancelled, suspended, many tickets have sold out.
*11:29.840- 11:34.280* :  So there's obviously the concern that if the situation escalates,
*11:34.620- 11:38.200* :  tens of thousands of foreign nationals would be stranded in the country.
*11:38.200- 11:40.280* :  But there hasn't been any sign of panic.
*11:40.280- 11:45.360* :  There hasn't been any indication that people are desperately trying to leave the country,
*11:45.360- 11:47.960* :  but still fans have soared.
*11:47.960- 11:55.260* :  So to give you an example, a one-way ticket to London from Beirut is usually 350 pounds.
*11:55.360- 11:59.580* :  Now the same ticket costs at least 700 pounds.
*11:59.580- 12:05.400* :  And this is the situation for many flights to different locations here from Beirut.
*12:05.820- 12:13.520* :  How unusual is it Hugo for allies to talk to each other and issue these kinds of messages
*12:13.580- 12:19.020* :  to tell people to leave, not to go, to register if they really have to be in that part of the world?
*12:20.020- 12:25.580* :  I think that two things here. One, countries don't want to be in a situation where they need
*12:25.580- 12:30.720* :  to carry out massive accusations of tens of thousands of people.
*12:30.720- 12:35.600* :  So now we're seeing here that there is the expectation that this is going to be a wide-scale attack
*12:35.600- 12:41.920* :  by Iran. American officials believe that this attack will be in coordination between Iran
*12:41.920- 12:46.920* :  and its proxies in the region, including Hezbollah here in Lebanon.
*12:46.920- 12:52.360* :  And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today said that Israel is going to respond
*12:52.360- 12:54.140* :  to any act of aggression.
*12:54.240- 12:59.840* :  So there is the fear that this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into something bigger.
*12:59.840- 13:06.100* :  And we could see the airport being targeted or having to seize its operations.
*13:06.100- 13:10.860* :  And then in the end tens of thousands of foreign nationals would be stranded in the country.
*13:11.300- 13:17.680* :  But obviously that fear has been there for many months and suddenly it's ratcheted up several levels.
*13:18.460- 13:25.340* :  Exactly. So we've seen those two assassinations. We've seen the threats from Iran and Hezbollah
*13:25.340- 13:30.760* :  saying that they're going to retaliate to these attacks. But we simply don't know what is going to
*13:30.760- 13:36.880* :  happen. The Israeli authorities are making preparations for the possibility of a wide-scale attack.
*13:37.320- 13:42.280* :  Again, American officials believe that Iran is planning an attack that is bigger than
*13:42.280- 13:48.440* :  the one that it carried out in April when it launched more than 300 missiles and drones.
*13:48.440- 13:57.380* :  So again, there is the concern here that this retaliation from Iran, from Hezbollah here in Lebanon
*13:57.960- 14:01.020* :  could lead to a wider conflict in this region.
*14:01.860- 14:07.800* :  Huka Bashagah with me from Beirut. An Israeli airstrike has hit two schools in Gaza City
*14:07.800- 14:12.960* :  housing people displaced by the war with Hamas. Palestinian media say a number of people have
*14:12.960- 14:17.060* :  been killed. From Jerusalem, here's our correspondent Barbara Plattasha.
*14:17.740- 14:21.260* :  Videos on social media showed fires burning inside one of the schools.
*14:21.260- 14:26.840* :  Body scattered in the yard and people rushing to carry casualties to hospital, including children.
*14:26.940- 14:32.540* :  This scene has played out over and over again, with numerous Israeli airstrikes on schools in
*14:32.540- 14:38.280* :  recent weeks, including one just a day earlier. Israel's military accuses Hamas militants of
*14:38.280- 14:42.680* :  hiding in the schools and using them as command centers to plan and carry out attacks,
*14:42.680- 14:48.600* :  something Hamas denies. Israeli forces have continued strikes and shalling against Hamas targets
*14:48.600- 14:54.260* :  in the Gaza Strip, as diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire falter. The latest round of talks
*14:54.260- 14:59.400* :  in Cairo ended without progress on Saturday. Since the war in Gaza began in October,
*14:59.400- 15:03.440* :  it's estimated that nearly 40,000 people have been killed in the territory.
*15:04.100- 15:08.860* :  The death toll comes from the Hamas-led health authority. The attack on Israel on the 7th of
*15:08.860- 15:14.780* :  October left 1200 people dead when Hamas launched their surprise attack. It's estimated that
*15:14.780- 15:20.680* :  more than 19,000 people have been injured in Gaza. With most of its healthcare system decimated,
*15:21.240- 15:26.280* :  last week, the UN's World Health Organization said that more than 80 sick and severely injured
*15:26.280- 15:31.660* :  patients have been evacuated to Abu Dhabi in the UAE for treatment. Another group has been
*15:31.660- 15:37.240* :  taken to Europe, including four, to Belgium. Julian Marshall has been talking to Jaland Van Bala,
*15:37.240- 15:41.380* :  the Belgian pediatrician and emergency doctor who's overseeing their care.
*15:42.120- 15:46.960* :  There's a lot of children going to different European countries. They have all kinds of
*15:46.960- 15:53.160* :  conditions. The ones that Belgium took up have oncological, so cancer and hematological,
*15:53.160- 15:59.380* :  blood diseases, conditions, and more complex diseases. And the treatment that she will be giving
*15:59.380- 16:06.540* :  them is what months long chemo-radio-therapy? Yes, it's also complex treatments, so not just
*16:06.540- 16:13.600* :  for cancer or blood conditions, but complex investigations like MRI scans, genetic investigations,
*16:13.600- 16:18.940* :  and then the treatment will be months, not just chemotherapy, but also transfusions,
*16:18.940- 16:25.840* :  not only of blood cells, but different types of transfusions and surgery, surgery that was not
*16:25.840- 16:31.340* :  being available in the region. So in Gaza, the situation is very difficult, but also in the
*16:31.340- 16:37.140* :  neighboring countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, it's getting more complicated to give them the
*16:37.140- 16:42.500* :  treatment they need because there's so many of them. And this initiative where Belgium participated,
*16:42.500- 16:47.740* :  is a European initiative, to bring these children to places where they can have their long-term
*16:47.740- 16:54.800* :  treatments in the best possible way. You are also treating young people who will have been very
*16:54.800- 17:02.400* :  traumatized by months and months of conflict, and that must offer additional challenges.
*17:02.860- 17:09.380* :  It does, and of course our team involved in bringing these children to Belgium and other European
*17:09.380- 17:16.080* :  countries is a very large team, and in Belgium, a lot of psychosocial workers are involved. All
*17:16.080- 17:21.840* :  of these people are taking care of the physical condition of the children, but also of the mental
*17:21.840- 17:27.040* :  condition, and not only the children, but also their families, brothers and sisters that accompany
*17:27.040- 17:31.580* :  them to Belgium. And that was Gilland Van Belaar, who's a Belgian pediatrician.
*17:33.760- 17:37.780* :  Still to come? It could be a scene from a science fiction movie,
*17:37.780- 17:45.220* :  tearing over dark mossy lava fields, our stacks of noisy machines, the size of shipping containers.
*17:45.620- 17:50.960* :  A new technique to capture carbon dioxide and turn it into stone has been developed in Iceland.

*19:04.840- 19:10.040* :  President Zelensky says Ukraine's Air Force pilots have started flying F-16 fighter planes
*19:10.040- 19:15.200* :  in combat operations over the country, but he said more of the aircraft were needed to overcome
*19:15.200- 19:21.200* :  Russian forces. The US-made planes have been eagerly anticipated by Ukraine since Russia's
*19:21.200- 19:26.100* :  full-scale invasion began two and a half years ago. Here's our Ukraine correspondent James
*19:26.100- 19:32.100* :  Waterhouse in Kiev. As has often been the case with Western military aid, Ukraine has been asking
*19:32.100- 19:39.280* :  for F-16s for some time. Now it has them. At an unnamed airbase, flanked by two of the US-made
*19:39.280- 19:44.520* :  warplanes with more flying overhead, President Zelensky finally announced their arrival.
*19:44.900- 19:52.020* :  These jets are in our sky and officially today you see them and it's good that they came
*19:52.060- 19:58.460* :  and we can use them. They have a cannon and can carry rockets, bombs and missiles. In theory,
*19:58.460- 20:04.820* :  they will allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian-occupied territory. More F-16s are expected,
*20:04.820- 20:09.760* :  but Mr. Zelensky acknowledged he did not yet have enough trained pilots to fly them.
*20:10.260- 20:14.840* :  Until now, his air force has pumped above its weight with a small fleet of Soviet
*20:14.840- 20:20.960* :  air-fighter jets. Russia, meanwhile, has increasingly enjoyed air superiority as it continues to
*20:20.960- 20:27.460* :  launch missiles and glide bombs on Ukrainian positions and cities. Kiev hopes its new F-16s
*20:27.740- 20:33.820* :  will make its air force more of a match. A new technique to capture carbon dioxide and turn it
*20:33.820- 20:39.060* :  into stone has been developed in Iceland. Huge machines have been built to take the greenhouse
*20:39.060- 20:44.640* :  gas from the atmosphere before it's pumped underground. Money from investors is pouring in to the
*20:44.640- 20:49.780* :  building of the new direct-air capture projects, but how effective are they? Can they really help us
*20:49.780- 20:55.860* :  fight climate change? A reporter Adrian Murray has been to one newly-open plant southeast of Reykjavik.
*20:57.480- 21:03.700* :  It could be a scene from a science-fiction movie, tearing over dark, mossy lava fields,
*21:03.700- 21:07.960* :  or stacks of noisy machines, the size of shipping containers,
*21:08.480- 21:15.140* :  guzzling up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Called direct-air capture, this technology has been
*21:15.140- 21:21.020* :  pioneered by Swiss firm Kleinworks, and its chief operating officer Douglas Chan
*21:21.020- 21:26.680* :  showed me a rant to new plant. What you see here are 12 of our collector containers.
*21:27.160- 21:33.100* :  When the plant is fully operational, we'll actually have 72th around the plant. That will enable us
*21:33.100- 21:41.640* :  to capture 36,000 tons of CO2 every year. The idea is to suck up emissions that have already been pumped
*21:41.640- 21:48.620* :  into the atmosphere. It works like a giant vacuum. Each of these units is the size of a shipping
*21:48.620- 21:57.680* :  container and has a dotting powerful fans sucking in the surrounding air. They pull in Olympic swimming
*21:57.680- 22:05.000* :  pools worth of air every 40 seconds where a filter separates out the CO2. It's then flushed out
*22:05.000- 22:11.840* :  with hot steam and piped into the large processing hall. Capturing even small amounts of CO2 with
*22:11.940- 22:19.840* :  this method needs lots of energy and so mammoth gets both power and hot water from a nearby geothermal
*22:19.840- 22:26.080* :  plant. We want to make sure that we're using energy that has a low carbon footprint. Outside a tower
*22:26.420- 22:33.200* :  similar to a giant soda stream, then mixes fresh water with CO2, the captured greenhouse gas.
*22:36.400- 22:42.260* :  Hidden inside two white igloo-like domes is an injection well. And Dr. Martin Voit,
*22:42.520- 22:47.320* :  in my slantic partner, Carpfix, showed me how the carbon is locked away.
*22:47.320- 22:53.080* :  This well is going 700 meters down into the underground here. Acting like a storage reservoir,
*22:53.520- 23:00.120* :  the CO2 and water fill up tiny spaces in the porous, bustle bedrock. It then reacts with other
*23:00.120- 23:08.260* :  elements and turns into solid minerals. To explain, Dr. Voit showed me two pieces of rock before and
*23:08.300- 23:13.080* :  after the process. This is a fresh puzzle here actually from one of the last volcanic eruptions
*23:13.080- 23:17.840* :  here in Iceland. You can see there's a lot of porosity in here. Here you can see there's a lot of
*23:17.840- 23:23.000* :  these pores now filled with white aspects. Some of these contain the mineralized CO2.
*23:23.340- 23:28.960* :  And that happens relatively quickly. We're not talking about millions or tens of thousands of years.
*23:29.300- 23:34.220* :  Around about 95 percent of the CO2 was mineralized. He was in two years in the pilot project.
*23:34.480- 23:40.880* :  Mammoth is almost 10 times bigger than climate's first commercial plant. But the 36,000 tons of
*23:40.880- 23:48.080* :  CO2 it removes is still only similar to taking 8,000 petrol cars off the road. Direct air capture
*23:48.080- 23:54.140* :  is not without critics. He thinks such techno fixes are over height, pointing to the high costs,
*23:54.140- 24:01.020* :  energy consumption and limited scale. Dr. Edvard Julia Solnes is a professor at the University of
*24:01.020- 24:08.000* :  Iceland and a former Icelandic environment minister. We release about 40 billion tons of carbon
*24:08.000- 24:14.660* :  dioxide every year. So this won't make a dent. But I think you should use all methods to fight
*24:14.660- 24:21.420* :  this problem. Despite repeated coal to curb emissions, record volumes of planet heating CO2
*24:21.420- 24:27.180* :  would churn out last year. Many climate experts think techniques to remove carbon from the atmosphere
*24:27.180- 24:33.300* :  will be needed to help fight global warming. Worldwide billions of dollars are being spent and
*24:33.300- 24:36.920* :  dozens of new plants like Mammoth are now on the drawing board.
*24:38.020- 24:44.680* :  Adrian Murray in Iceland. It may not have the most exciting name, A23A, but something remarkable
*24:44.680- 24:50.300* :  is happening to the world's biggest iceberg. Scientists say it's stuck in a type of vortex and
*24:50.300- 24:55.020* :  is spinning on the spot in the southern ocean. Let's get more from our science correspondent,
*24:55.020- 25:02.260* :  Jonathan Amos. The iceberg known as A23A drifted beyond Antarctica in April. It's path took
*25:02.260- 25:07.160* :  into the great current that encircles the polar continent, the most powerful movement of water
*25:07.160- 25:12.520* :  on earth. This should have shot the berg up into the south Atlantic to disintegrate and melt away,
*25:13.000- 25:19.060* :  but A23A went nowhere. For four months now it's been an icy spinning top just going around and
*25:19.060- 25:24.700* :  around, close to the south orkney islands. Scientists say it's been caught in a fascinating ocean
*25:24.700- 25:30.580* :  phenomenon called a Taylor column, a vortex of water that conforms when a strong current moves
*25:30.580- 25:36.860* :  past a mountainous region on the sea floor. Such columns can persist for years and if the ice giant
*25:36.860- 25:43.220* :  can't escape its decay and eventual demise will be delayed. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos,
*25:43.620- 25:44.820* :  now take a listen to this.
*25:48.240- 25:54.500* :  Hi everybody! Today we are going to learn how to make Korean traditional kimchi.
*25:54.500- 26:02.520* :  In Korean it's called hogi kimchi or tome tu kimchi. As you know there are so many different
*26:02.520- 26:06.640* :  Korean traditional Korean side dish consisting of salted and fermented vegetables.
*26:07.200- 26:11.280* :  New figures show exports have hit a record high for the first half of this year,
*26:11.600- 26:16.240* :  driven by the growing global popularity of Korean cuisine and Britain. It's one of the main
*26:16.240- 26:22.340* :  overseas markets. Here's Mickey Bristo. Korean culture in the shape of TV dramas and pop
*26:22.340- 26:27.440* :  answers become influential across the world. South Korea now has another growing cultural
*26:27.440- 26:33.660* :  export. Kimchi, made most often from cabbage, it was originally developed as a way to preserve
*26:33.660- 26:37.940* :  vegetables through the winter. It's eaten with just about every meal in Korea.
*26:38.640- 26:44.600* :  It's also increasingly enjoyed abroad too, as Korean food and restaurants become popular.
*26:45.140- 26:51.400* :  In the last six months South Korea has exported a record 24,000 tons of the pickled side dish.
*26:52.000- 26:57.280* :  The US, Britain and the Netherlands have made your market, where kimchi is also seen as having
*26:57.280- 27:04.360* :  health benefits, particularly for digestion, as spicy condiment, now not just for Koreans.
