*00:00.080- 00:03.300* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.700- 00:06.900* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*00:06.900- 00:10.260* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Thursday, the 8th of August.
*00:10.860- 00:14.940* :  Russia declares a state of emergency in the curse region after a cross-border
*00:14.940- 00:16.480* :  incursion blamed on Ukraine.
*00:17.280- 00:20.940* :  How Bangladesh is moving on after its Prime Minister was forced out of power.
*00:21.660- 00:24.780* :  Bangladesh's future is now in the hand of the students.
*00:24.780- 00:29.000* :  It's our duty and responsibility to protect the sovereignty and freedom
*00:29.000- 00:29.820* :  for our people.
*00:30.520- 00:34.480* :  Thousands of people march against racism in England as police try to prevent
*00:34.480- 00:36.120* :  more far-right unrest.
*00:39.120- 00:39.920* :  Also in the podcast,
*00:41.340- 00:46.360* :  South Africa's electricity crisis continues to be front and center of everyone's
*00:46.360- 00:46.660* :  minds.
*00:46.660- 00:50.080* :  Many people just want an end now to the rolling blackouts.
*00:50.580- 00:54.940* :  How South Africa put an end to its power blackouts for now at least.
*00:55.700- 00:58.960* :  And a parrot is honored by Guinness World Records for its memory.
*01:04.200- 01:08.480* :  For much of this year, Ukraine has been on the back foot in its attempt to hold off
*01:08.480- 01:12.420* :  the Russian invaders, losing small but significant bits of territory.
*01:12.420- 01:16.700* :  It's been forced to rush troops to counter a new offensive near its second city
*01:16.700- 01:20.500* :  Harkiv while dealing with shortages of manpower and ammunition.
*01:21.260- 01:25.320* :  Now, though, Ukrainian forces are reported to have taken the fight into Russia
*01:25.320- 01:29.220* :  itself with an incursion over the border north of Harkiv.
*01:29.220- 01:33.420* :  President Putin said Ukraine was targeting the Russian region of Kursk.
*01:35.300- 01:40.300* :  As you know, the Kiev regime has carried out another big provocation
*01:40.460- 01:43.580* :  with indiscriminate shelling of civilian buildings,
*01:43.720- 01:48.280* :  residential housing and medical facilities with different kinds of
*01:48.280- 01:49.980* :  weapons, including missiles.
*01:51.460- 01:55.960* :  The latest reports suggest intense battles are still underway in the area,
*01:56.440- 01:58.600* :  which is near a major gas transit hub.
*01:59.060- 02:03.580* :  The authorities on both sides of the border, Kursk in Russia and Sumi in Ukraine,
*02:03.580- 02:07.680* :  have announced the evacuation of thousands of residents while Russia has declared
*02:07.680- 02:08.780* :  a state of emergency.
*02:08.780- 02:12.360* :  I got the latest from our correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse.
*02:12.800- 02:14.840* :  It is something that we haven't really seen before.
*02:14.840- 02:19.120* :  It is true that Ukraine has struck inside Russian territory before,
*02:19.120- 02:24.800* :  but usually in the form of pro-Ukrainian Russian militants who've been
*02:24.800- 02:29.360* :  sort of incorporated into Ukraine's military, where they've made incursions
*02:29.360- 02:32.340* :  before in the Elgorod region of Russia further south.
*02:32.720- 02:38.020* :  Ukraine has also mounted several drone attacks on Russian territory
*02:38.020- 02:40.740* :  to the nervousness of some Western allies.
*02:40.840- 02:45.160* :  But this is the first time we have seen regular forces deployed in this way
*02:45.600- 02:47.580* :  and on this scale. It would seem.
*02:47.720- 02:50.380* :  It's still a little bit murky, but something is going on.
*02:50.980- 02:55.320* :  When you look at the reports of several settlements being taken
*02:55.940- 03:00.580* :  by the Ukrainians close to the border, Russian bridgeheads on the narrow network
*03:00.640- 03:03.700* :  of rivers have been destroyed and clearly, you know,
*03:03.700- 03:07.120* :  when you look at the rocket strikes that are taking place in the armored vehicles
*03:07.120- 03:10.960* :  that accompany these soldiers, this is something sizable and something
*03:11.440- 03:14.440* :  Ukraine is looking to sustain in the short term.
*03:14.640- 03:18.420* :  And all of the chatter on this, but you've seen local officials
*03:18.420- 03:22.300* :  in Russia confirm evacuations and you've seen the defence ministry
*03:22.300- 03:25.940* :  confirming the redeployment of troops and you have Vladimir Putin himself
*03:25.940- 03:30.600* :  being briefed by his security chiefs and accusing Ukraine of a provocation.
*03:30.980- 03:34.500* :  It shows that, you know, whilst Russia is making its size count just about
*03:34.500- 03:38.000* :  everywhere else, it just may have blindsided it on this occasion.
*03:38.300- 03:41.860* :  Yes, so what do you think the strategy is here from Ukraine?
*03:41.860- 03:44.520* :  I thought they were struggling with a shortage of manpower,
*03:44.520- 03:47.940* :  particularly in areas like the Donbass, where they're trying to defend territory.
*03:48.460- 03:50.440* :  Well, in the words of one Ukrainian colonel,
*03:50.620- 03:54.140* :  this seems to be a preventative measure, because some will remember
*03:54.140- 03:58.080* :  Russia launched a major cross-border offensive in May in the Northeastern
*03:58.080- 04:03.960* :  Hardgiv region, where it overstretched already thin Ukrainian personnel.
*04:04.640- 04:08.540* :  It extended the front line and it brought the city of Hardgiv into very real danger.
*04:09.220- 04:12.960* :  The fear here is that Russia has continually been building tens of thousands of troops
*04:12.960- 04:15.560* :  along its border with Ukraine in this northern area.
*04:16.100- 04:20.020* :  And it seems, on face value, that the Ukrainians have tried to get ahead of that
*04:20.400- 04:22.960* :  around the Sumi region and the city of Sumi.
*04:23.280- 04:27.020* :  And you can see, you know, if you follow that logic, it makes sense
*04:27.060- 04:32.160* :  because of how Russia has been forced to redeploy in such a way.
*04:32.320- 04:35.680* :  But I think, you know, a lot of military analysts inside Ukraine were a little
*04:35.680- 04:38.960* :  bit shocked this morning by the admission of the head of the armed forces.
*04:39.180- 04:41.140* :  It's biggest issue at the moment is manpower.
*04:41.640- 04:44.280* :  It is grappling to mobilize enough men for its war effort.
*04:44.500- 04:50.100* :  So sending hundreds of Ukrainians into Russia itself was counter-intuitive
*04:50.380- 04:51.780* :  at best in the eyes of some.
*04:52.320- 04:56.520* :  But clearly, if it means stopping Russia from causing Ukraine problems,
*04:56.520- 04:58.740* :  what would be a new part of the front line in the North,
*04:59.140- 05:00.520* :  then it just might be worth it.
*05:00.520- 05:04.780* :  The question is now for how long it can keep hold of this territory.
*05:04.880- 05:09.040* :  And at what cost, and that would have to be a cost that's acceptable politically
*05:09.720- 05:10.720* :  for President Zelensky?
*05:11.220- 05:12.920* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev.
*05:13.720- 05:17.840* :  The new interim leader of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, has urged people to avoid
*05:17.840- 05:19.620* :  violence and remain calm.
*05:20.320- 05:24.140* :  More than 400 people were killed during the protest that forced the long term
*05:24.140- 05:26.320* :  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena out of power.
*05:26.800- 05:30.100* :  But Muhammad Yunus, an economist and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize,
*05:30.560- 05:34.140* :  insisted that exciting possibilities lay ahead for Bangladesh.
*05:34.860- 05:36.980* :  Samara Hussein reports from the capital, DACA.
*05:39.180- 05:41.400* :  I'm at one of the busiest junctions in DACA.
*05:41.780- 05:45.200* :  Cars, motorbikes, rickshaws coming in all different directions.
*05:46.160- 05:48.580* :  There is not a single police officer in sight.
*05:49.200- 05:52.520* :  Instead, traffic is being directed by students and volunteers.
*05:52.660- 05:58.020* :  People like 22-year-old Joker name, Rahat, who have taken it upon themselves
*05:58.020- 06:00.320* :  to maintain law and order on the streets.
*06:01.000- 06:04.080* :  Bangladesh Future is now in the hands of students.
*06:04.080- 06:09.140* :  It's our duty and responsibility to protect the sovereignty and freedom for our people.
*06:09.140- 06:12.620* :  I don't know what will happen to Bangladesh Future, but in inshallah,
*06:12.980- 06:16.940* :  slowly or steadily, we're going to change the future of Bangladesh and the youth generation.
*06:17.320- 06:21.140* :  He was one of the thousands who participated in anti-government protests that led
*06:21.140- 06:24.920* :  to the surprise resignation of the country's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena.
*06:25.660- 06:28.760* :  Further down the road, a young woman wearing a black face mask
*06:28.760- 06:33.100* :  stands in the middle of the busy street, directing traffic with a stick in her left hand,
*06:33.100- 06:34.940* :  she said, we gained our freedom.
*06:35.560- 06:39.300* :  So far, students have been able to maintain some semblance of normality,
*06:39.740- 06:41.480* :  filling a void left by the police.
*06:42.160- 06:46.880* :  As the new caretaker administration prepares to take charge, the question here is,
*06:47.240- 06:49.460* :  how long will that sense of order last?
*06:50.260- 06:52.280* :  Samara Hussein in DACA.
*06:52.740- 06:57.020* :  The mass protests, which broke out across Iran nearly two years ago,
*06:57.020- 07:00.200* :  were triggered by the death in police custody of Masa Amini.
*07:00.620- 07:03.380* :  She had been accused of wearing her headscarf improperly.
*07:03.960- 07:07.940* :  Now an investigation has begun after a video went viral showing morality,
*07:07.940- 07:13.200* :  police beating and arresting a teenage girl for allegedly violating the hijab code.
*07:13.200- 07:19.120* :  The newly elected Iranian president, Masoud Pazeshgan, has vowed to stop such confrontations.
*07:19.640- 07:23.480* :  See, a vash adlan of the BBC Persian service told me more about the footage.
*07:24.060- 07:26.360* :  We are seeing that there are two girls standing in the streets,
*07:26.360- 07:31.540* :  not wearing their hijab and then a morality police van passes by.
*07:32.080- 07:35.040* :  A number of people, including men and women, get off the van.
*07:35.040- 07:39.620* :  They go to these girls and they violently drag them into the van.
*07:39.620- 07:44.720* :  They're obviously resisting arrest, but they're eventually thrown into the van.
*07:44.720- 07:46.220* :  And then the van takes off.
*07:46.360- 07:48.000* :  That's what we see in the video itself.
*07:48.140- 07:50.440* :  Now, after remember, you made reference to Masa Amini.
*07:50.440- 07:56.000* :  This comes at a time when the collective psyche of Iranians is very much impacted
*07:56.000- 08:00.300* :  with that particular incident two years ago where Masa Amini died in police custody.
*08:00.800- 08:04.000* :  So people are very sensitive to the issue of mandatory hijab now.
*08:04.000- 08:08.380* :  And why the police would want to do this in order to enforce this law still?
*08:08.720- 08:13.800* :  Yeah, it's going to say how strictly the hijab rules applied, particularly to teenagers.
*08:14.780- 08:16.260* :  It's not very strictly applied.
*08:16.260- 08:22.160* :  And that's one of the accomplishment of that movement that was triggered after Masa Amini's death.
*08:22.160- 08:26.740* :  A lot of women are now not observing the rules and are not wearing hijab.
*08:26.740- 08:31.920* :  A very large proportion of women are not even taking their scars with them when they leave the house.
*08:32.440- 08:40.220* :  But every now and then the government, the police, in order maybe to assure their social base
*08:40.220- 08:43.180* :  that they're doing something about it, that they're not being complacent.
*08:43.180- 08:49.600* :  Every now and then they make an example of a few women, girls or celebrities for not wearing hijab
*08:49.640- 08:51.660* :  while the rest of society are not observing it.
*08:51.660- 08:56.280* :  If you go to restaurants or cafes or out in the street, a lot of women aren't wearing hijab.
*08:56.320- 09:01.880* :  But when this happens to one particular person, it's reminiscent of those terrible events
*09:01.880- 09:03.780* :  after that woman life freedom movement.
*09:04.260- 09:05.460* :  Interesting timing, though.
*09:05.460- 09:11.600* :  It comes not long after the inauguration of the new president or a relative reformer.
*09:11.800- 09:15.180* :  And he has been promising to kind of relax these rules.
*09:15.680- 09:22.840* :  It's a huge test now for Masa Amini's new Iranian president who had called morality police immoral.
*09:23.240- 09:26.420* :  But let's not forget there's one very important fact here.
*09:26.880- 09:31.080* :  And that is at first when this video went viral, a lot of Pesysh Kyan supporters
*09:31.080- 09:36.880* :  thought that they actually, this might be employed by hardliners to show that Pesysh Kyan is a weak president
*09:36.880- 09:40.460* :  that he's really towing the line of the hardliners.
*09:40.880- 09:46.420* :  Whereas the incident took place before Masa Amini's position in inauguration about six weeks ago.
*09:46.480- 09:51.760* :  And the reason why the mother of that girl in question publicized this video was because she said
*09:52.060- 09:56.060* :  she had launched the complaint against the police and the complaint didn't go anywhere.
*09:56.460- 09:58.540* :  Hence she thought that it's best to publicize it.
*09:58.540- 10:01.680* :  And the police has very proactively reacted to this.
*10:01.680- 10:06.100* :  Both the police and the judiciary saying, yes, there has been a violation of the rules.
*10:06.240- 10:10.240* :  The way the girl was treated was not according to the rules and regulations.
*10:10.420- 10:12.180* :  And an investigation is being launched.
*10:12.180- 10:15.140* :  So they have acknowledged that a mistake was being made.
*10:15.140- 10:18.280* :  But they said that the girl really wasn't heard that much.
*10:18.280- 10:22.020* :  Whereas the mother is saying when she went to pick up the girl at the police station,
*10:22.020- 10:23.360* :  she looked battered and bruised.
*10:23.660- 10:26.900* :  See, our island of the BBC Persian service for years.
*10:26.900- 10:32.440* :  South Africa has suffered crippling power cuts, plunging the nation into darkness for hours on end.
*10:32.900- 10:34.580* :  And last year was the worst yet.
*10:35.380- 10:42.320* :  But for the past few months, the deliberate power cuts known as load shedding by the state energy company Eskom have disappeared.
*10:43.060- 10:45.620* :  While the government has admitted it acted too late,
*10:45.620- 10:50.720* :  possibly costing the ANC the election, it is a remarkable turn around.
*10:50.720- 10:57.300* :  So what happened and could the power cuts return the BBC's adhabitants sent this report from Johannesburg?
*10:58.820- 11:04.120* :  South Africa's electricity crisis continues to be front and centre of everyone's minds.
*11:04.120- 11:07.580* :  Many people just want an end now to the rolling blackouts.
*11:07.820- 11:10.840* :  It's hard to overstate just how bad the crisis was.
*11:11.180- 11:13.360* :  Issues of vandalism and sabotage.
*11:13.900- 11:16.860* :  The main issue, Eskom, the national power company,
*11:17.360- 11:19.400* :  right with mismanagement and corruption.
*11:20.020- 11:25.180* :  The rot was much worse than I anticipated when I took the job.
*11:25.320- 11:27.340* :  This is former CEO Andre Dorator,
*11:27.780- 11:32.020* :  speaking to local media outlet ENCA after his resignation last year.
*11:32.520- 11:38.320* :  My rough estimate of the amount of money that gets stolen in Eskom every month
*11:39.340- 11:41.580* :  is in the region of a bullion-read.
*11:45.640- 11:48.600* :  I've come to Alexandra, one of the biggest townships in Johannesburg,
*11:48.600- 11:50.680* :  to find Cezaca Rasha Mosin.
*11:51.440- 11:52.700* :  We met her here last year.
*11:53.220- 11:56.280* :  She told us she thought she was going to have to close down because of load shedding.
*11:58.920- 12:00.240* :  Now her restaurant is bustling.
*12:00.940- 12:02.120* :  There's meat frying on the grill.
*12:03.000- 12:05.800* :  There's dozens of bottles of beer being delivered to the bottle store.
*12:06.380- 12:08.180* :  Cezaca.
*12:08.400- 12:09.720* :  How are you?
*12:10.960- 12:11.900* :  We came here last year.
*12:12.680- 12:15.000* :  You had really bad load shedding.
*12:15.220- 12:16.160* :  Yeah, and a member.
*12:16.760- 12:17.980* :  So how's the load shedding now?
*12:18.620- 12:19.300* :  It's better now.
*12:19.780- 12:20.700* :  The electric bus.
*12:21.380- 12:21.780* :  It's better.
*12:22.640- 12:23.500* :  Are you going to stay open?
*12:24.060- 12:25.680* :  Yes, I'm going to stay open.
*12:27.080- 12:27.780* :  No plans to play.
*12:28.100- 12:28.340* :  No.
*12:30.360- 12:30.380* :  No.
*12:30.380- 12:31.120* :  No, there's any more.
*12:31.300- 12:32.220* :  So what changed?
*12:33.400- 12:34.560* :  Fellows of Africans.
*12:35.440- 12:39.900* :  Tonight, I'd like to address you about the energy crisis that is...
*12:39.900- 12:44.860* :  The recovery really started with this speech from President Cyril Ramaposa two years ago.
*12:45.640- 12:50.980* :  We have therefore developed a set of actions to respond to this crisis.
*12:52.040- 12:55.440* :  What followed was a $14 billion government bailout.
*12:56.240- 12:59.280* :  Then, Ramaposa created the role of Minister of Electricity.
*12:59.960- 13:03.840* :  An ESCOM launched a two-year plan to revamp its power stations
*13:03.840- 13:07.340* :  and, crucially, a complete overhaul of its management.
*13:07.920- 13:10.580* :  Lochering really was discouraging all of us.
*13:10.900- 13:12.160* :  Moral was very low.
*13:12.240- 13:12.540* :  And...
*13:12.540- 13:14.740* :  Daphne McQueener is ESCOM's spokesperson.
*13:15.420- 13:17.480* :  This leadership was also transforming countries.
*13:17.860- 13:21.900* :  Also, to hold people accountable in terms of those that do not perform,
*13:22.260- 13:25.240* :  are held accountable, but also reward performance.
*13:25.560- 13:27.900* :  There has also been a big increase in renewable energy,
*13:27.900- 13:31.760* :  particularly solar, both in industry and in homes.
*13:32.260- 13:36.020* :  This has all led to fewer unplanned outages in ESCOM's power stations,
*13:36.600- 13:37.820* :  which has allowed more maintenance.
*13:38.580- 13:42.140* :  And in July, ESCOM manages highest output in six years.
*13:43.940- 13:45.000* :  Thank you very much, Chair.
*13:45.420- 13:48.240* :  Good morning to members of the media.
*13:49.080- 13:52.260* :  This is Josianso Ramahopa, the Minister of Electricity,
*13:52.680- 13:54.220* :  giving one of his regular briefings.
*13:54.720- 13:57.740* :  A government effort and transparency while fixing load shedding.
*13:57.920- 13:59.900* :  Load shedding started in 2007.
*13:59.900- 14:03.020* :  Why do you think it's taken so long for the government to solve
*14:03.340- 14:05.140* :  what turned out to be a huge crisis?
*14:05.620- 14:07.280* :  So the truth must be told, I think,
*14:07.380- 14:09.760* :  we'll have managed this situation better when we...
*14:09.760- 14:13.300* :  While he's been instrumental, he does admit it may have cost his party
*14:13.300- 14:18.040* :  the ANC, the May election, losing its majority for the first time ever.
*14:18.440- 14:19.760* :  Do you think it was too little too late?
*14:19.820- 14:23.060* :  You look at the election result for the ANC at Daphne below 50%.
*14:23.060- 14:24.900* :  Do you think if you tackle the problem earlier,
*14:24.900- 14:26.260* :  that might have been a bit of a boost?
*14:26.640- 14:27.760* :  Absolutely correct.
*14:27.760- 14:32.600* :  I mean, it has taken a road at a significant percentage point from the ANC.
*14:33.320- 14:35.980* :  Because our core base is not convinced
*14:35.980- 14:40.180* :  that the administration is capable and willing to resolve the problem.
*14:40.740- 14:42.380* :  We have paid the penalty, we are here.
*14:42.880- 14:44.420* :  I'm confident that we'll get it right.
*14:44.940- 14:46.700* :  So it's load shedding now, I think, of the past.
*14:47.040- 14:48.560* :  We're not out of the woods yet,
*14:48.560- 14:52.940* :  the probability of us going back to load shedding very slim.
*14:53.200- 14:55.020* :  A bold statement after a crisis
*14:55.420- 14:57.580* :  that held the country to ransom for so long,
*14:58.080- 15:00.140* :  a country that is now daring to believe
*15:00.240- 15:02.020* :  that the lights are back on for good.
*15:02.740- 15:03.900* :  And ambition reporting.
*15:06.540- 15:08.180* :  And still to come on the global news podcast?
*15:08.820- 15:12.100* :  I really hope that it's a call to arms to everyone
*15:12.100- 15:15.180* :  and to our leaders to address climate change.
*15:15.280- 15:18.000* :  It's not just for the future of the reef
*15:18.260- 15:20.040* :  but cascades into all of our lives.
*15:20.620- 15:23.760* :  Scientists warn that the seas around the great barrier reef
*15:23.760- 15:26.020* :  are the warmest for at least four centuries.
*15:27.100- 15:28.880* :  And before we move on, just time to let you know
*15:28.880- 15:31.080* :  that our fellow BBC World Service podcast,
*15:31.080- 15:34.140* :  The Global Story, has taken an in-depth look
*15:34.140- 15:35.720* :  at Kamala Harris' running mate,
*15:36.040- 15:37.880* :  the Minnesota Governor Tim Watts.
*15:46.400- 15:48.340* :  After days of unrest across England,
*15:48.340- 15:50.080* :  fermented by the far right,
*15:50.080- 15:53.380* :  thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets
*15:53.900- 15:55.800* :  on Wednesday in a show of opposition.
*15:56.500- 15:59.080* :  Police were out in force ahead of dozens of planned,
*15:59.080- 16:02.360* :  far-right rallies amid fears of further racist attacks
*16:02.360- 16:05.000* :  against Muslims and immigration centres.
*16:05.640- 16:08.940* :  Violence erupted early last week after three young girls
*16:08.940- 16:11.000* :  were killed in a knife attack in Southport
*16:11.360- 16:13.840* :  near Liverpool, with false online rumours
*16:13.840- 16:15.480* :  blaming an Islamist migrant.
*16:16.160- 16:18.260* :  For the latest on Wednesday night events,
*16:18.260- 16:20.580* :  we heard from two of our correspondents,
*16:21.020- 16:22.560* :  first Ed Thomas, in Liverpool.
*16:23.040- 16:24.540* :  This is St Anne's Church.
*16:24.600- 16:28.200* :  It's now a refugee and asylum seeker support centre
*16:28.740- 16:31.360* :  and hundreds of people gathered here today
*16:31.360- 16:33.820* :  to perform a human train to protect.
*16:34.660- 16:36.860* :  This place, now, the windows, the doors,
*16:36.860- 16:39.700* :  they're all boarded up here because they believe
*16:39.700- 16:43.340* :  that they were under threat from a far-right protest.
*16:43.340- 16:46.020* :  Now, that protest didn't materialise.
*16:46.420- 16:49.320* :  Many people here said it was important to come out
*16:49.340- 16:50.640* :  and show community.
*16:50.640- 16:52.520* :  This is what Toby told us earlier.
*16:53.080- 16:57.160* :  We come here today to show our support for the city
*16:57.160- 16:58.620* :  and for asylum link as well.
*16:58.620- 16:59.380* :  That's why we're here.
*16:59.760- 17:01.380* :  And I'm very, very sure,
*17:01.880- 17:03.940* :  if these take us 10 hours to be here,
*17:03.940- 17:06.700* :  we would be here to protect our city
*17:07.060- 17:08.220* :  because we love our city.
*17:08.920- 17:11.600* :  There was a real diverse group of people here.
*17:11.600- 17:14.860* :  They wanted to show symbols of togetherness.
*17:15.220- 17:18.140* :  But there's also been confusion and misinformation here.
*17:18.140- 17:22.760* :  All of this was sparked by a list of places like this
*17:22.840- 17:27.600* :  on unverified accounts shared on social media.
*17:27.600- 17:29.680* :  And that is why people have turned up.
*17:29.680- 17:31.840* :  There were moments here tonight where people thought,
*17:31.840- 17:33.640* :  oh, there was a mosque under attack.
*17:33.640- 17:35.420* :  But again, that was all misinformation.
*17:35.420- 17:37.340* :  And it wasn't true.
*17:37.740- 17:39.540* :  There was a hope that the violence
*17:39.540- 17:42.140* :  and the riots that we've seen of the past few days
*17:42.620- 17:43.820* :  will belong to the past.
*17:44.380- 17:46.240* :  Thomas in the northwest of England
*17:46.600- 17:48.660* :  and our correspondent in Newcastle
*17:48.660- 17:50.280* :  in the northeast, Lucy Manning,
*17:50.620- 17:53.220* :  told us about an anti-racism demonstration there.
*17:53.800- 17:56.880* :  More than 1,000 people here on the pavement
*17:56.880- 17:58.440* :  outside the Beacon Centre.
*17:58.920- 18:01.040* :  It houses an immigration services office
*18:01.040- 18:03.820* :  and was on the list where the far right said
*18:04.000- 18:05.860* :  they would come out here this evening.
*18:06.320- 18:07.380* :  But there was no sign of them.
*18:07.380- 18:09.080* :  And frankly, I'm not sure where they would have gone
*18:09.380- 18:11.760* :  because there were so many people out here.
*18:12.040- 18:15.380* :  The counter-demonstrators chanted they were shouting,
*18:15.840- 18:16.620* :  George is united.
*18:17.160- 18:18.500* :  We will never be defeated.
*18:18.500- 18:20.240* :  And refugees are welcome here.
*18:20.620- 18:23.160* :  And the largely Muslim crowd also chanted Allu Akbar.
*18:23.720- 18:24.820* :  God is the greatest.
*18:25.040- 18:26.020* :  But no trouble here.
*18:26.020- 18:28.760* :  The police stayed largely on the sidelines.
*18:29.080- 18:30.900* :  I think the key question tonight is
*18:31.200- 18:33.280* :  whether this is now a turning point,
*18:33.460- 18:35.240* :  whether these counter-demonstrators
*18:35.240- 18:37.860* :  have reclaimed the streets in a peaceful way,
*18:37.860- 18:40.260* :  whether the arrests and the heavy sentencing
*18:40.300- 18:42.120* :  have deterred people,
*18:42.320- 18:43.260* :  or on the other hand,
*18:43.260- 18:44.800* :  whether this is just a midweek,
*18:45.160- 18:46.240* :  people have worked tomorrow,
*18:46.880- 18:48.840* :  and there isn't as much drinking.
*18:48.840- 18:51.860* :  But speaking to the local imam here,
*18:52.240- 18:55.280* :  he said that they were scared to come out to protest,
*18:55.280- 18:58.380* :  but they were really reassured by the amount of people
*18:59.200- 19:00.160* :  that came out here.
*19:00.220- 19:02.980* :  And they hope this is a turning point for unity
*19:03.580- 19:04.980* :  and for there to become.
*19:05.860- 19:08.160* :  Lucy, manning in the English city of Newcastle.
*19:09.120- 19:13.280* :  Three Taylor Swift concerts in the Austrian capital Vienna
*19:13.280- 19:15.840* :  have been cancelled because of a terror threat.
*19:16.460- 19:18.020* :  Two men were detained on suspicion
*19:18.100- 19:20.100* :  of planning an Islamist attack in the area.
*19:20.600- 19:21.720* :  Bethany Bell has the details.
*19:22.420- 19:25.360* :  The police here in Vienna gave a press conference
*19:25.420- 19:27.140* :  a little bit earlier this evening,
*19:27.620- 19:30.360* :  saying that they had arrested two people today.
*19:31.020- 19:34.040* :  One of them was a 19-year-old Austrian citizen
*19:34.120- 19:37.260* :  in a town just south of Vienna called Turnits.
*19:38.300- 19:41.000* :  And another person was arrested here in Vienna.
*19:41.000- 19:44.260* :  The police say these people were radicalized
*19:44.800- 19:45.820* :  via the internet,
*19:46.260- 19:49.100* :  and the 19-year-old recently,
*19:49.100- 19:55.020* :  the police say, took an oath of allegiance to Islamic State.
*19:55.640- 19:58.360* :  Now, they did a big search on his house today
*19:58.360- 20:01.840* :  and a number of houses in the town had to be evacuated.
*20:02.440- 20:03.920* :  And after this news came,
*20:04.820- 20:07.320* :  the organizers of the Taylor Swift concerts
*20:07.320- 20:10.360* :  said that they had to cancel the shows
*20:10.940- 20:13.200* :  for the sake of everybody's safety.
*20:13.880- 20:16.360* :  And they have said that people's money
*20:16.360- 20:19.140* :  will be returned in the next 10 days.
*20:19.760- 20:20.380* :  And I can tell you,
*20:20.380- 20:24.020* :  there are a lot of very, very disappointed Taylor Swift fans
*20:24.480- 20:25.260* :  in Vienna tonight.
*20:25.740- 20:27.240* :  Bethany Bell in Austria.
*20:28.260- 20:30.840* :  Without rapid action to tackle climate change,
*20:30.840- 20:33.320* :  our generation will likely witness the demise
*20:33.320- 20:35.360* :  of one of Earth's natural wonders,
*20:35.460- 20:37.140* :  the great barrier reef.
*20:37.600- 20:39.140* :  That warning comes from scientists
*20:39.140- 20:42.640* :  who've analysed 400 years of data on sea temperatures
*20:43.200- 20:46.080* :  and found the past decade has seen the hottest waters on record.
*20:46.760- 20:49.540* :  Modeling showed human activity was to blame for the warming,
*20:49.540- 20:52.880* :  which has led to repeated mass coral bleaching events.
*20:53.540- 20:56.080* :  I asked our science correspondent, Victoria Gill,
*20:56.380- 20:58.820* :  how the researchers were able to work out sea temperatures
*20:58.820- 21:00.420* :  from the past four centuries.
*21:00.880- 21:04.620* :  Essentially, the key signal comes from inside the coral itself.
*21:04.620- 21:07.120* :  So over many, many years,
*21:07.120- 21:09.840* :  lots of scientists have taken core samples.
*21:09.840- 21:12.780* :  These kind of long cores that they can drill out of corals.
*21:12.780- 21:13.860* :  Without damaging the coral,
*21:13.860- 21:17.340* :  they can take a sample that shows chemical signal
*21:17.340- 21:20.580* :  that it's laid down in its body in its skeleton as it's grown.
*21:21.100- 21:24.820* :  Some of the oldest of these samples go back several centuries.
*21:24.820- 21:28.000* :  So that's what they have is kind of a temperature record
*21:28.000- 21:30.680* :  that the coral has built up within its own body.
*21:31.240- 21:34.020* :  And they've gone through those exhaustively thousands of those records.
*21:34.500- 21:37.040* :  And critically, they've cross-referenced them
*21:37.320- 21:38.880* :  with temperature records.
*21:39.520- 21:42.120* :  Yeah, they've looked at 400 years of sea temperatures
*21:42.120- 21:44.900* :  based on this coral and found it's just getting hotter.
*21:45.240- 21:51.180* :  There's lots of fluctuations for various reasons over the decades.
*21:51.640- 21:55.380* :  But it's this very, very rapid change in the last 10 years.
*21:55.420- 21:58.000* :  So there have been these major bleaching events,
*21:58.000- 21:59.100* :  these coral bleaching events,
*21:59.200- 22:03.240* :  where essentially the corals adapted to live within certain parameters
*22:03.240- 22:05.320* :  of temperature, to live within a temperature range.
*22:05.900- 22:06.900* :  And when it gets too hot,
*22:06.900- 22:08.460* :  the coral gets very stressed,
*22:08.720- 22:11.180* :  and it expels the plant,
*22:11.180- 22:13.660* :  the symbiotic plant that lives inside it.
*22:13.660- 22:15.280* :  It's kind of the engine of the coral,
*22:15.380- 22:17.400* :  and it also gives it this bright, beautiful colour.
*22:17.780- 22:19.140* :  So we call it coral bleaching,
*22:19.380- 22:21.920* :  because that's exactly what it looks like, the coral turns white.
*22:22.000- 22:23.780* :  Now that's not the coral dieting.
*22:24.080- 22:25.700* :  It can recover from that,
*22:25.700- 22:28.500* :  and it can build a symbiotic algae again,
*22:28.500- 22:29.560* :  and get back to business.
*22:29.560- 22:30.900* :  But if the heat doesn't relent,
*22:31.620- 22:32.980* :  it remains very, very stressed,
*22:33.380- 22:34.780* :  and it can't recover.
*22:35.140- 22:37.720* :  And so what do they say needs to happen?
*22:37.920- 22:40.760* :  It's kind of a simple and very complicated message
*22:40.760- 22:42.160* :  that we hear over and over again,
*22:42.160- 22:44.000* :  and that's that we need to act on climate change.
*22:44.240- 22:45.800* :  I spoke to Professor Helen McGregor
*22:45.800- 22:47.960* :  from the University of Wallingong in Australia
*22:47.960- 22:49.340* :  who was involved in the research,
*22:49.560- 22:50.680* :  and this is what she told me.
*22:51.200- 22:54.560* :  I really hope that it's a call to arms to everyone,
*22:54.760- 22:55.800* :  and to our leaders,
*22:56.280- 22:58.540* :  to address climate change.
*22:59.080- 23:01.180* :  There's a lot of targets that have been said,
*23:01.180- 23:03.840* :  and targets that are not being met,
*23:04.060- 23:05.640* :  and they really, really need to be.
*23:05.920- 23:09.120* :  And it's not just for the future of the reef, you know,
*23:09.120- 23:10.800* :  it cascades into all of our lives.
*23:11.220- 23:14.280* :  Even with the temperature rises that are already baked in,
*23:14.560- 23:17.140* :  with the greenhouse gases that are in the atmosphere already
*23:17.140- 23:19.100* :  and with the current rates of emissions,
*23:19.940- 23:23.080* :  we face losing a lot of our coral reefs,
*23:23.080- 23:26.180* :  and the great barrier reef will not look the same.
*23:26.580- 23:28.360* :  It's not the same coral throughout the reef.
*23:28.360- 23:29.360* :  It's lots of different reefs,
*23:29.420- 23:30.360* :  and they respond differently.
*23:30.480- 23:32.100* :  The different species respond differently.
*23:32.100- 23:34.240* :  Some are tough and hardy and some less so,
*23:34.760- 23:35.680* :  but it will change.
*23:35.840- 23:38.200* :  It will not look the same in the future as it does now.
*23:38.660- 23:41.240* :  But what the scientists are saying is that we still have a chance,
*23:41.240- 23:42.880* :  even though it will change,
*23:43.100- 23:44.240* :  and some of it won't survive,
*23:44.240- 23:47.080* :  we still have a chance to save parts of it
*23:47.160- 23:48.960* :  and give it the chance to recover
*23:49.400- 23:53.720* :  if we can limit global temperature rise really strictly now.
*23:54.260- 23:56.100* :  Our science correspondent, Victoria Gill.

*27:15.380- 27:15.820* :  What's this call?
*27:17.380- 27:17.740* :  What's this call?
*27:19.380- 27:19.540* :  What's this call?
