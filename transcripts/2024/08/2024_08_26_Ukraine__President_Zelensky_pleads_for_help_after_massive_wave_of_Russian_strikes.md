*01:19.000- 01:22.180* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.100- 01:28.160* :  I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 26th of August.
*01:28.160- 01:29.580* :  These are our main stories.
*01:30.260- 01:36.040* :  The Ukrainian President says Russia targeted his country with about 200 missiles and drones on Monday.
*01:36.040- 01:42.040* :  He's urging his allies to use their air defense capabilities to intercept attacks in Ukrainian airspace.
*01:42.900- 01:45.240* :  There being a string of attacks in southwestern Pakistan.
*01:45.240- 01:50.540* :  In the worst single incident, ethnic Punjabis appear to have been singled out and then shot.
*01:52.240- 01:56.800* :  Also in this podcast, we're here from one of the treatment centres in the Democratic Republic of Congo
*01:57.480- 01:59.080* :  overwhelmed with MPOX patients.
*01:59.520- 02:02.180* :  We are full of fear because we are crowded in our shelters.
*02:02.800- 02:04.120* :  We sleep in very poor conditions.
*02:04.900- 02:07.280* :  We share beddings. Prevention is difficult.
*02:08.140- 02:10.160* :  And because of that, we are free.
*02:11.200- 02:15.940* :  And Germany suggests it'll toughen its approach to what it's calling irregular migrants.
*02:19.080- 02:22.760* :  Russia has launched a large-scale missile and drone barrage on Ukraine.
*02:22.760- 02:27.560* :  More than half of its regions were targeted and the whole country was put on air raid alert.
*02:28.180- 02:31.580* :  President Zelensky has appealed for more help from his Western allies.
*02:35.500- 02:41.740* :  In our various regions of Ukraine, we could do much more to protect lives
*02:41.740- 02:50.020* :  if the aviation of our European neighbours work together with our F-16s and together with our air defence.
*02:50.020- 02:56.920* :  If such unity has worked so well in the Middle East, it should work in Europe as well.
*02:58.080- 03:01.100* :  I've been talking to our reporter Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasulov in Kiev.
*03:01.900- 03:05.940* :  We're now just getting the latest figures about the scale of this attack
*03:05.940- 03:12.200* :  and President Vladimir Zelensky has stated that Russia used more than 100 missiles
*03:12.940- 03:17.400* :  and about another 100 drones to target cities across Ukraine.
*03:18.140- 03:26.020* :  So you can only imagine the scale of this attack just looking by this sheer number of missiles and drones that Russia launched.
*03:26.540- 03:31.280* :  And also among the weapons that they used, the cruise missiles and Shahid drones,
*03:31.580- 03:37.720* :  Russia also launched ballistic missiles, Kinjal missiles, to target cities in Ukraine.
*03:38.120- 03:40.940* :  And these missiles are much harder to intercept.
*03:41.500- 03:47.000* :  And we're still waiting for reports from the Air Force about how many targets they managed to intercept
*03:47.000- 03:53.180* :  and which would give us an indication how many missiles and drones managed to go through
*03:53.180- 03:54.880* :  and to pass through the defence systems.
*03:55.460- 04:00.000* :  But it's clear that some of those missiles did cause some damage
*04:00.800- 04:01.920* :  possibly from falling debris.
*04:01.920- 04:07.060* :  We're getting reports that the buildings in Poltava region, in Luzk, in Odessa
*04:07.320- 04:10.960* :  and other regions as well were damaged during that attack.
*04:11.500- 04:16.160* :  And we're hearing reports that at least four people have been killed in that attack
*04:16.620- 04:19.560* :  according to the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Dennis Schmighal,
*04:19.980- 04:25.480* :  are more than half of the Ukrainian regions were affected by these air barrages.
*04:25.980- 04:31.580* :  The Kremlin said that there will be a response to Ukraine's incursion into Western course.
*04:31.580- 04:34.980* :  Now, the way the statement puts it is that there will be a response.
*04:35.540- 04:38.880* :  It seems increasingly clear that what we've seen is part of the response.
*04:39.500- 04:43.480* :  Possibly, this could be, you know, the Russia's attempt to retaliate
*04:43.760- 04:48.340* :  following the Ukrainian armed forces' incursion into the Russian region of Kursk.
*04:48.680- 04:51.660* :  It could be a possibility, of course, but this is not the only time
*04:51.660- 04:53.320* :  when Russia launched such a massive attack.
*04:53.600- 04:58.920* :  Only last month Russia hit the Ukraine's biggest children's hospital in Kiev
*04:59.340- 05:02.740* :  and also they launched dozens of missiles and drones at that time as well.
*05:03.140- 05:08.820* :  So such attacks happened quite frequently and it is, of course, difficult to say
*05:08.820- 05:12.820* :  that this one was definitely linked to the curse and incursion.
*05:12.920- 05:17.420* :  This is rather a general policy that Russia have been carrying out throughout this war.
*05:18.480- 05:20.660* :  Abdul-Jadeal Abdul-Asulov with me from Kiev.
*05:21.540- 05:25.320* :  At least 39 people have been killed in southwestern Pakistan
*05:25.320- 05:29.020* :  after a gunman stopped vehicles and forced their occupants out.
*05:29.700- 05:33.340* :  Local media reports say the attackers question the ethnicity of the travelers
*05:33.800- 05:35.400* :  before deciding whether to shoot them.
*05:35.500- 05:38.440* :  Here's our Pakistan correspondent, Caroline Davis.
*05:39.260- 05:42.420* :  The largest number of deaths occurred late on Sunday when, according to police,
*05:42.580- 05:45.900* :  attackers stopped several vehicles traveling between Punjab and Baluchistan.
*05:46.440- 05:49.000* :  They forced the passengers out and opened fire on them.
*05:49.500- 05:53.880* :  According to media reports citing the police, the attackers checked IDs before shooting.
*05:54.380- 05:57.100* :  Those reports say that most of the victims were from Punjab.
*05:57.760- 06:01.480* :  The incident took place around 450 kilometres from the province's capital Quetta.
*06:02.120- 06:04.400* :  Other attacks are reported to have taken place in Kalat,
*06:04.400- 06:07.320* :  where security personnel were amongst the dead, and in Belan,
*06:07.380- 06:10.200* :  where several bodies were discovered near a bridge that had been blown up.
*06:10.780- 06:13.980* :  The separatist group, the Baluch Liberation Army, has released a statement
*06:13.980- 06:16.240* :  saying that they have conducted operations throughout the province,
*06:16.540- 06:18.540* :  including attacks on people travelling in buses.
*06:19.020- 06:22.500* :  Not all of the incidents they have claimed have been confirmed by Pakistani officials.
*06:23.280- 06:26.080* :  Trains have been suspended between Baluchistan and the rest of the country.
*06:26.620- 06:29.260* :  Pakistan's Interior Minister has said that those involved
*06:29.660- 06:31.840* :  would not escape what he called a fateful end.
*06:32.760- 06:35.080* :  More than 10 months of air strikes have left much,
*06:35.080- 06:39.620* :  perhaps most of Gaza in ruins, a worsening humanitarian situation
*06:40.060- 06:42.480* :  and an increased threat of disease now as well.
*06:42.920- 06:48.880* :  Over the weekend, the World Health Organization confirmed its first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years.
*06:49.320- 06:51.580* :  It was contracted by a 10-month-old baby.
*06:52.180- 06:57.380* :  There's a UN effort now underway to try to get more than a million polio vaccines into Gaza.
*06:57.380- 07:01.220* :  I've been hearing more about this from our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher.
*07:01.840- 07:06.480* :  The alarm was sounded a couple of weeks ago when there were samples taken from the earth
*07:06.480- 07:11.800* :  in Gaza back at the end of June, which showed traces of a polio virus.
*07:12.240- 07:16.900* :  And then, as you say, a week or so ago, there was news for the 10-month-old baby
*07:16.900- 07:24.480* :  had its leg paralyzed after contracting the disease and that was confirmed by the WHO just a few days ago.
*07:24.980- 07:29.260* :  And again, as you say, this is the first outbreak, if one can call it that,
*07:29.280- 07:33.080* :  the first case to be detected in Gaza in 25 years.
*07:33.100- 07:33.700* :  And that's down.
*07:33.700- 07:38.580* :  As you're saying to the mass devastation, the collapse of a health system,
*07:39.160- 07:44.860* :  sanitation, et cetera, all the things which lead to disease and polio as one of them.
*07:45.100- 07:48.780* :  Yes, and the fear is, as the UN has put it, this isn't just a disease,
*07:48.780- 07:51.000* :  but it's confined to Gaza.
*07:51.000- 07:54.560* :  This could spread to Israel, this could spread beyond.
*07:54.560- 08:00.320* :  So there's been a mass move by the UN to provide these vaccinations.
*08:00.400- 08:02.420* :  And we started to go in on Sunday.
*08:03.220- 08:08.480* :  So the World Health Organization clearly has access to a large number of vaccine doses.
*08:08.480- 08:13.120* :  It can get them there. It can only get them there if there's a pause in the fighting.
*08:13.400- 08:16.040* :  Yes, I mean, that is what it was saying about a week ago,
*08:16.440- 08:22.220* :  saying that it wants to deliver the vaccinations to more than 600,000 children who could be at risk.
*08:22.380- 08:26.300* :  But in order to do so with most Palestinians displaced,
*08:26.300- 08:31.920* :  it's not exactly the case that you can go door to door as you would with a normal vaccination campaign.
*08:31.960- 08:36.400* :  They need to have centers that they will create where people can come.
*08:36.400- 08:39.860* :  But how can they get there with the fighting still raging?
*08:39.860- 08:44.080* :  So they called for two seven day pauses in the fighting court on both Israel
*08:44.540- 08:45.880* :  and Hamas to allow that to happen.
*08:45.880- 08:49.320* :  Now we've had no sign, obviously, but that's about to happen.
*08:49.320- 08:52.820* :  So they're saying that they're still going to go ahead with and do the best they can,
*08:52.820- 08:53.960* :  but it's going to be very difficult.
*08:54.180- 08:56.120* :  And just looking at what's going on more broadly,
*08:56.120- 09:01.580* :  we've obviously had much worse violence on the border between Israel and Lebanon over the weekend.
*09:02.340- 09:07.020* :  What impact does that have on the possibility of ceasefire talks relating to Gaza?
*09:07.260- 09:08.580* :  They're separate in a way, obviously.
*09:08.580- 09:13.760* :  I think there might be an argument that Hamas had wanted his bullet to do more
*09:13.760- 09:19.300* :  that that would help its bargaining position and will be dissatisfied that its attack wasn't as strong.
*09:19.300- 09:22.140* :  The ceasefire talks have continued, but with no breakthrough.
*09:22.420- 09:24.100* :  The US has been talking it up hugely,
*09:24.100- 09:26.960* :  but the other mediators, Hamas itself, even Israel,
*09:27.360- 09:29.260* :  have suggested that big obstacles still remain.
*09:29.260- 09:31.800* :  So we're still without any real breakthrough.
*09:32.520- 09:33.480* :  Now, staying with the Middle East,
*09:33.480- 09:39.160* :  Lebanon has announced three days of mourning following the death of its former Prime Minister Salim al-Hos,
*09:39.240- 09:40.120* :  who was 94.
*09:40.120- 09:47.320* :  He served as Prime Minister during most of the Lebanese civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990.
*09:47.320- 09:51.480* :  I spoke to our former Middle East correspondent Jim Muir, who's in Beirut,
*09:51.880- 09:53.080* :  a new Mr Al-Hos well.
*09:53.880- 09:55.220* :  You're writing a book about him.
*09:55.420- 09:57.400* :  I think you've probably entitled it something like,
*09:57.880- 10:00.800* :  a thoroughly decent man, because that's what he was.
*10:00.980- 10:03.420* :  And in Lebanon, I have to say it's extremely rare.
*10:03.660- 10:06.160* :  I mean, I can think of the range of politicians now.
*10:06.680- 10:08.900* :  I mean, they all have their followers who revere them,
*10:08.940- 10:11.980* :  but mainly it has to be said on a kind of sectarian basis.
*10:12.520- 10:15.800* :  They're all up to their necks in corruption, basically.
*10:16.320- 10:19.080* :  No one's ever suggested that Salim al-Hos was like that.
*10:19.480- 10:21.740* :  He was Prime Minister three or four times,
*10:21.740- 10:25.560* :  depending on how you counter it, because two of his premier ships kind of merged.
*10:25.660- 10:27.680* :  And one of them was very controversial,
*10:27.680- 10:31.000* :  because at one stage, he was Prime Minister in West Beirut,
*10:31.020- 10:37.120* :  and General Michel Al-Niame commander had made kind of Christian Prime Minister in Eastern Beirut.
*10:37.120- 10:38.720* :  So the country was divided.
*10:38.720- 10:40.280* :  They couldn't agree on a president.
*10:40.500- 10:46.780* :  So for quite a while, there was a country with no president and two rival prime ministers of whom he was one.
*10:47.220- 10:52.160* :  But as I say, he was totally regarded with respect, didn't get rich.
*10:52.600- 10:56.740* :  And he basically, he was sort of slightly, I would say, leftist and his views.
*10:56.740- 11:00.080* :  He believed in helping the common man,
*11:00.140- 11:02.300* :  and that's what he dedicated his life to.
*11:02.700- 11:08.280* :  Obviously, he was playing a pretty crucial role during the tumultuous years in Lebanon that you've described.
*11:08.280- 11:11.460* :  You met him several times. What was he like to spend time with?
*11:12.200- 11:14.460* :  He always was extremely generous with his time.
*11:15.240- 11:18.020* :  Any time I want to talk to him, I'd phone up and he'd say, come on round.
*11:18.140- 11:20.200* :  And we had a chat. He had humor.
*11:21.020- 11:22.200* :  He was just very accessible.
*11:22.740- 11:24.480* :  And very kind of non-sectarian.
*11:24.480- 11:26.920* :  He had to be a Sunni Muslim, because the Prime Minister,
*11:27.560- 11:30.480* :  except during the days of General Al-Niame, the Christian Prime Minister,
*11:30.520- 11:31.780* :  which he shouldn't really have been.
*11:32.220- 11:34.820* :  Now, the Prime Minister traditionally is always a Sunni Muslim.
*11:35.220- 11:40.780* :  Okay, he wasn't a Sunni Zahim or leader like he didn't have a militia or anything like that.
*11:41.240- 11:44.880* :  He was just a thoroughly accessible, almost a technocrat.
*11:44.880- 11:47.220* :  He was an economist, a kind of specialist.
*11:47.220- 11:52.400* :  He wasn't a kind of doctor and a politician who tried to impose his views on everybody.
*11:52.980- 11:54.600* :  Jim Mule with me from Beirut.
*11:55.500- 11:59.400* :  The recent ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been broken
*11:59.400- 12:01.480* :  with fighting between the army and the rebels,
*12:01.480- 12:04.740* :  both sides accusing each other of breaching the agreement.
*12:04.740- 12:09.200* :  The continuing violence in the east has not only displaced millions of people,
*12:09.200- 12:13.280* :  but also complicates efforts to fight the M-pox virus outbreak.
*12:14.020- 12:15.500* :  The latest statistic given to the BBC,
*12:16.320- 12:19.480* :  the majority of those being treated for M-pox, about 70 percent,
*12:19.480- 12:21.500* :  are children under the age of 10.
*12:22.620- 12:26.480* :  We've also been given access to two treatment centres in eastern DRC.
*12:27.160- 12:29.480* :  Our Africa correspondent, Simi Choloso, reports.
*12:30.540- 12:33.480* :  Children at this hospital in Kavimu in South Kivu,
*12:33.480- 12:34.240* :  appear weary and in pain.
*12:35.500- 12:37.480* :  This includes two-year-old Anseema,
*12:37.500- 12:38.600* :  who caught M-pox from one of her five siblings,
*12:40.900- 12:42.760* :  who have all had the disease.
*12:42.760- 12:46.420* :  Her mother, Inzigeria Kanigo, had no idea what it was.
*12:47.740- 12:51.520* :  This is the first time I've seen it.
*12:51.520- 12:55.480* :  When my child got sick, other parents told me it might be measles,
*12:55.480- 12:57.500* :  but we started treating measles and failed,
*12:57.840- 12:58.900* :  so we decided to come here.
*13:00.040- 13:01.480* :  Three are cured, and they're at home.
*13:01.520- 13:05.440* :  I only have two who I am admitted with now in this hospital.
*13:05.440- 13:06.360* :  I thank God.
*13:06.760- 13:11.500* :  We've been given access to the M-pox virus outbreak.
*13:11.500- 13:14.600* :  We've been given access to the M-pox virus outbreak.
*13:15.060- 13:15.840* :  I thank God.
*13:20.500- 13:24.620* :  Doctors at this hospital say there's been high demand for beds and medicines,
*13:24.620- 13:26.220* :  but not enough supply.
*13:26.760- 13:29.620* :  It's had 800 M-pox patients since June.
*13:30.040- 13:32.140* :  More than 70% have been children.
*13:32.780- 13:33.760* :  Eight have died.
*13:34.580- 13:38.700* :  About a hundred miles away in the treatment centre in Renegania Goma,
*13:39.200- 13:41.540* :  six-year-old Amani skips around his room.
*13:44.420- 13:48.500* :  He is finally recovering from M-pox after four days of free treatment.
*13:49.360- 13:53.040* :  His father, and then Mataboro, describes what it was like.
*13:53.420- 13:58.260* :  It began like a flame sport.
*13:58.920- 14:01.280* :  The mother's twisted and what her discharge came out.
*14:02.060- 14:03.160* :  Then another developed.
*14:03.920- 14:06.680* :  And after a short period, they were all over.
*14:06.680- 14:14.500* :  Like the hospital, three-quarters of patients here have been under the age of ten.
*14:15.120- 14:19.140* :  Dr Pierre Livier and Gajole, who works for the charity Mede,
*14:19.620- 14:23.040* :  told the BBC they've had up to ten new cases a day.
*14:23.300- 14:25.000* :  The IDP have been overcrowded.
*14:25.500- 14:29.580* :  So you see children in IDP camps, they are always playing together.
*14:30.360- 14:32.580* :  They don't tell about the social distance.
*14:32.580- 14:33.640* :  They don't tell about that.
*14:34.500- 14:38.820* :  In the household, they even pass the night on the same bed,
*14:39.100- 14:40.920* :  can find three, four, five children.
*14:41.520- 14:45.120* :  So the contact is very so close and is very permanent.
*14:45.760- 14:49.820* :  So that means the transmission is really present on day basis.
*14:55.300- 14:58.800* :  This region, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*14:59.300- 15:02.020* :  is filled with millions of people who have been displaced
*15:02.020- 15:04.480* :  because of an ongoing armed conflict.
*15:05.000- 15:07.960* :  They can be crammed in makeshift structures at camps
*15:07.960- 15:12.520* :  where the living conditions are often poor and lack good sanitation,
*15:13.140- 15:16.080* :  the perfect place for epochs to run rampant.
*15:20.100- 15:24.160* :  Charity workers are trying to get ahead by teaching people about symptoms,
*15:24.800- 15:26.040* :  stigma and hygiene.
*15:26.740- 15:30.060* :  The message resonates with some at Mujakamp in Nira-Gongo,
*15:30.060- 15:32.320* :  but it doesn't suppress their fear.
*15:36.080- 15:39.100* :  We have been sensitized, but we are full of fear because
*15:39.860- 15:42.920* :  we are crowded in our shelters, we sleep in very poor conditions,
*15:42.920- 15:46.380* :  we share bedding, so prevention is difficult.
*15:47.200- 15:49.240* :  And because of that, we are afraid.
*15:53.540- 15:54.760* :  We have children in the house,
*15:55.400- 15:57.820* :  tell our leaders to send us medicine,
*15:58.360- 16:00.140* :  soaps and other protective measures
*16:00.420- 16:01.580* :  so that we don't get infected.
*16:03.820- 16:04.820* :  The government is hopeful
*16:04.820- 16:07.560* :  that epochs vaccinations will begin this week,
*16:08.200- 16:09.740* :  with children first in line,
*16:09.740- 16:12.900* :  but the incessant conflict will pose a challenge.
*16:17.680- 16:18.760* :  Still to come in this podcast,
*16:18.760- 16:21.820* :  a new video game based on Welsh folklore.
*16:22.240- 16:24.320* :  To explain to you was a Welsh language game.
*16:24.420- 16:26.620* :  It was quite exciting that it was the Marbanogeon,
*16:26.860- 16:28.260* :  so I jumped to the chance really.
*16:34.880- 16:37.080* :  The poor manager of the England football teams,
*16:37.080- 16:38.760* :  Fenure and Erickson has died.
*16:39.300- 16:42.380* :  He was 76, and in January revealed he'd been diagnosed
*16:42.380- 16:44.080* :  with pancreatic cancer.
*16:44.720- 16:46.420* :  He won multiple awards at club level,
*16:46.420- 16:49.480* :  and as a suite was the first non-English manager
*16:49.480- 16:51.260* :  of the England team in 2001.
*16:52.220- 16:54.480* :  He often got a hard time from mass circulation newspapers
*16:55.400- 16:55.860* :  in the UK.
*16:56.400- 16:57.900* :  Here he is in 2005,
*16:57.900- 17:00.120* :  speaking about the pressures of the job.
*17:00.860- 17:02.240* :  The pressure is on England.
*17:02.240- 17:04.860* :  The pressure is on Brazil, Argentina, Italy,
*17:05.560- 17:07.500* :  Holland, a lot of Sweden team as well,
*17:07.540- 17:08.980* :  of course, to do very well.
*17:09.740- 17:10.480* :  But I think that's good.
*17:11.000- 17:12.180* :  I'm not suffering from that.
*17:12.520- 17:15.100* :  I want to have a job where pressure is very, very high.
*17:15.620- 17:17.480* :  Because if you don't have a lot of pressure
*17:17.480- 17:19.120* :  on the team you're working with,
*17:19.660- 17:20.940* :  that means you have a very bad team,
*17:21.260- 17:23.000* :  and who wants to have a bad team.
*17:23.400- 17:24.580* :  We know that we have a good team.
*17:24.580- 17:26.120* :  The pressure is enormously,
*17:27.140- 17:29.420* :  but I'm sure that the players can cope with that,
*17:29.620- 17:30.240* :  live up to that.
*17:30.640- 17:32.080* :  Then we'll see what's happening in the tournament.
*17:32.140- 17:35.680* :  We need a little bit of luck to do what we want to do.
*17:35.980- 17:38.820* :  My colleague Nigel Adely works as a football journalist
*17:39.020- 17:40.040* :  and had interviewed Sven,
*17:40.040- 17:42.040* :  you're an Ericsson, a number of times.
*17:42.100- 17:44.740* :  I asked Nigel how big a deal it was for him to be
*17:44.980- 17:46.820* :  the first non-English manager.
*17:47.640- 17:48.780* :  It was absolutely huge,
*17:48.980- 17:51.280* :  and I think Sven, who was the headline
*17:51.280- 17:52.560* :  on many of the newspapers
*17:52.560- 17:55.380* :  because although he'd had success across Europe,
*17:55.580- 17:57.320* :  particularly in Italy,
*17:57.860- 17:59.480* :  for the Football Association in England
*17:59.480- 18:01.340* :  to go for a foreign manager,
*18:01.860- 18:03.480* :  it was seen as a massive step,
*18:03.640- 18:05.280* :  and he also took charge of the
*18:05.660- 18:07.520* :  so-called Golden Generation at the time,
*18:08.140- 18:09.480* :  players like David Beckham,
*18:10.020- 18:11.480* :  Frank Lampard and Stephen Gerard.
*18:11.480- 18:14.480* :  There were plenty of highly talented players
*18:14.480- 18:16.520* :  with large egos in the dressing room,
*18:16.520- 18:18.480* :  but he was a very good coach,
*18:18.480- 18:21.480* :  but he was also a very good man-manager
*18:21.480- 18:22.920* :  within those dressing rooms.
*18:22.920- 18:26.260* :  He was a charming presence on and off the field.
*18:26.260- 18:29.240* :  Possibly didn't get the best out of the team,
*18:29.240- 18:30.660* :  maybe that he should have done finishing
*18:30.660- 18:32.640* :  with three quarterfinals during his time
*18:33.140- 18:34.920* :  as England manager and major tournaments,
*18:34.920- 18:37.380* :  but there's no doubt the players loved him,
*18:37.800- 18:39.500* :  and those of us in the football media loved him,
*18:39.500- 18:41.500* :  but certainly he did have issues
*18:42.120- 18:44.480* :  with the wider press in the United Kingdom.
*18:44.740- 18:46.480* :  Yeah, you can hear the sort of calm charm,
*18:46.480- 18:48.220* :  just in that little bit of in there.
*18:48.220- 18:49.580* :  Prince William in the last few minutes
*18:49.580- 18:52.520* :  described him as a true gentleman of the game.
*18:52.840- 18:54.360* :  He did get on a pressure, you know,
*18:54.500- 18:56.740* :  partly because of the team's performances by the end,
*18:56.800- 18:59.680* :  but also his whole business of not being English.
*18:59.680- 19:01.580* :  Did just give us a sense of what the newspapers
*19:01.580- 19:02.700* :  used to do to him.
*19:02.940- 19:04.580* :  Well, also, he did have a very colorful,
*19:04.600- 19:06.260* :  private life as well,
*19:06.500- 19:09.240* :  and there were a number of affairs off the field
*19:09.240- 19:12.060* :  during Spenior and Erickson's time as England coach,
*19:12.080- 19:14.720* :  and he found himself often on the front pages
*19:15.220- 19:16.760* :  as much as he was on the back,
*19:17.100- 19:18.260* :  on the sports pages,
*19:18.820- 19:20.340* :  and he always seemed bemused by that,
*19:20.500- 19:22.460* :  because when he was a coach in Sweden
*19:22.500- 19:25.280* :  and around Europe, his private life was private,
*19:25.500- 19:26.500* :  nobody discussed it,
*19:26.900- 19:29.160* :  but once you become the England manager
*19:29.560- 19:30.400* :  with the English press,
*19:30.820- 19:32.420* :  you become public property as well,
*19:32.500- 19:34.400* :  and he never quite got to grips with that,
*19:34.900- 19:37.600* :  and when he did have issues with his private life,
*19:37.600- 19:39.860* :  I think in the end, it became an issue
*19:40.280- 19:42.000* :  with the Football Association as well,
*19:42.000- 19:44.700* :  and that's why he was possibly removed
*19:44.700- 19:46.960* :  as the England coach before his time.
*19:46.960- 19:49.500* :  But I think today many people will remember him
*19:49.780- 19:52.560* :  as a charming man and also a very good football coach.
*19:53.340- 19:55.640* :  Just days after a stabbing at a festival
*19:55.640- 19:57.700* :  in the German town of Zolingen on Friday,
*19:58.160- 20:00.540* :  the German Chancellor Ola Schultz has pledged
*20:00.540- 20:02.600* :  to strengthen laws on gun ownership
*20:03.020- 20:05.100* :  and crack down on illegal migration.
*20:05.780- 20:08.480* :  A Syrian man who came to Germany as an asylum seeker
*20:08.520- 20:10.280* :  has been charged with the attack
*20:10.280- 20:12.620* :  in which three people died and eight were injured.
*20:13.160- 20:15.320* :  Prosecutors say the man is also suspected
*20:15.320- 20:17.480* :  of being a member of the Islamic State Group.
*20:18.080- 20:19.780* :  Mr. Schultz went to Zolingen on Monday
*20:19.780- 20:21.860* :  to lay flowers in memory of the victims.
*20:26.500- 20:29.180* :  Incidentally, this also applies
*20:29.180- 20:31.760* :  to the number of those who went to Germany irregularly.
*20:32.600- 20:33.640* :  The number must go down,
*20:34.180- 20:35.640* :  and therefore, it's good news that
*20:35.800- 20:37.240* :  through the decisions we've now made,
*20:37.660- 20:39.120* :  in particular the border control
*20:39.120- 20:40.380* :  for a newly established,
*20:40.840- 20:42.780* :  we've managed to reduce the number of people
*20:43.060- 20:44.660* :  who come to Germany irregularly.
*20:45.040- 20:47.500* :  A correspondent in Berlin is Damien McGinnis.
*20:48.180- 20:51.420* :  I think what was interesting about what Mr. Schultz said earlier today
*20:51.420- 20:54.500* :  was that he would ensure that those
*20:55.000- 20:56.460* :  who didn't have a right to stay in Germany
*20:56.460- 20:57.420* :  would be deported.
*20:57.420- 20:59.200* :  The question is, how did you do that?
*20:59.200- 21:02.500* :  And I think what a lot of experts have been saying here today
*21:02.500- 21:05.000* :  is that the legal mechanisms already there,
*21:05.580- 21:08.260* :  but what we saw in Zolingen was a failing
*21:08.260- 21:09.720* :  from the logistical side,
*21:10.140- 21:11.140* :  from the regional government,
*21:11.820- 21:15.440* :  which didn't manage to find the suspects
*21:15.920- 21:17.740* :  when he was due to be deported.
*21:18.560- 21:21.340* :  There are lots of big questions, humanitarian questions,
*21:21.340- 21:23.660* :  but legal questions about how you deport someone
*21:23.660- 21:27.520* :  whose application for asylum has been rejected by the authorities.
*21:27.520- 21:29.480* :  In the case of this particular suspect,
*21:30.160- 21:31.500* :  he had traveled from Bulgaria,
*21:31.500- 21:34.460* :  had come to Germany as a Syrian.
*21:34.760- 21:37.320* :  Most Syrians generally get their application
*21:37.320- 21:39.120* :  for asylum accepted in Germany.
*21:39.120- 21:44.720* :  In his case, it was rejected because he had already registered in Bulgaria.
*21:45.680- 21:48.320* :  But if you can't find the person, which is the case here,
*21:48.540- 21:51.460* :  then it's very difficult to deport them.
*21:51.840- 21:56.080* :  The other question is, if he was going to have to be deported back to Syria,
*21:56.540- 21:58.480* :  at the moment, that wouldn't be possible from Germany,
*21:58.540- 22:00.440* :  because there is no agreement to do that.
*22:00.440- 22:03.760* :  And Syria, it seems, is not a safe place and a country at war.
*22:04.540- 22:06.980* :  The other proposal from conservative politicians
*22:07.100- 22:11.040* :  is sending people back to Afghanistan,
*22:11.040- 22:14.780* :  because there's a lot of people who have come to Germany from Afghanistan,
*22:15.600- 22:19.020* :  and some of those don't get their applications for asylum accepted.
*22:19.600- 22:21.920* :  But that's also not possible right now, logistically,
*22:21.920- 22:23.680* :  because there is no agreement with the Taliban,
*22:23.700- 22:28.080* :  and Berlin does not want to talk with the Taliban about sending people back.
*22:28.120- 22:31.280* :  You have to pay to do it, you have to negotiate with the government,
*22:31.860- 22:33.980* :  and that's not something Berlin wants to do with the Taliban.
*22:34.120- 22:36.420* :  So on the one hand, you can have strong words.
*22:36.500- 22:38.340* :  On the other, if it's not legally possible,
*22:38.860- 22:40.480* :  or from an humanitarian view possible,
*22:41.340- 22:42.480* :  or even logistically possible,
*22:43.180- 22:44.920* :  it will be very difficult to enforce.
*22:45.720- 22:47.020* :  Damon McGinnis in Berlin.
*22:47.860- 22:51.300* :  Over the past week, heavy rain in Sudan has killed dozens of people
*22:51.300- 22:55.300* :  compounding hardship in a country that's already facing multiple crises.
*22:56.080- 23:00.120* :  Now at least 60 people have been killed after a dam in the east collapsed.
*23:00.840- 23:04.260* :  The dam in Red Sea states supplied water to ports to Dham,
*23:04.260- 23:05.840* :  where the military government is based.
*23:06.500- 23:10.640* :  Africa, regional editor, Richard Kaguay, is covering the story from Nairobi.
*23:11.260- 23:15.220* :  The tropical storm hit the region, causing a massive downpour,
*23:15.960- 23:20.340* :  and the sheer volume of water compromised the structure of this dam.
*23:20.500- 23:21.700* :  It's a major dam, actually.
*23:22.260- 23:25.700* :  And because there's lots of sediment, then what happened is that
*23:26.660- 23:28.100* :  it's sort of like got overwhelmed.
*23:28.100- 23:32.040* :  And that affected the integrity of this dam's structure.
*23:32.280- 23:36.280* :  So as a result of that, the water spill over and went downstream
*23:36.340- 23:41.460* :  and swept away villages, agricultural farms, especially even orchards.
*23:41.800- 23:44.320* :  And lots of people are reported to have been stranded
*23:44.320- 23:47.820* :  and they're desperately needing assistance right now,
*23:48.260- 23:50.480* :  because they just have a picture of the dam.
*23:50.480- 23:54.460* :  You can see large swats of land that have been covered in rainwater.
*23:54.900- 23:58.440* :  And what's the state of the rescue effort in that part of the country, Richard?
*23:58.640- 24:01.900* :  We've just had from one of the government officials,
*24:01.900- 24:04.960* :  specifically in charge of the Ministry of Water
*24:04.960- 24:06.480* :  and of course a disaster management.
*24:06.500- 24:10.060* :  What they're saying is that they have an impact on rescue
*24:10.360- 24:11.500* :  and such operations.
*24:11.620- 24:15.380* :  But of course this has really been hampered because of the rains there
*24:15.660- 24:20.160* :  and also the amount of water that have covered the affected region.
*24:20.220- 24:22.180* :  So it's still in the initial stages,
*24:22.180- 24:25.920* :  but lots of difficulties, you know, just rolling out at this exercise.
*24:26.300- 24:30.720* :  And obviously this is a country where there's violence and conflict going on.
*24:30.780- 24:32.600* :  What will the impact be on that, do you think?
*24:32.900- 24:34.940* :  It is really bad news for Sudan,
*24:34.940- 24:40.180* :  because this particular dam was constructed specifically to collect rainwater,
*24:40.700- 24:45.020* :  store it and then ensure that these year-round availability of water in the region
*24:45.020- 24:47.720* :  because this is sort of like a desert region.
*24:47.720- 24:56.060* :  And so this dam was supplying water, both for domestic and agricultural production in Potsudan.
*24:56.060- 25:00.940* :  So Potsudan is kindly where the Sudanese army has based its operations
*25:01.000- 25:02.280* :  and next to the Red Sea.
*25:02.680- 25:05.140* :  So a lot of people have been affected by this,
*25:05.140- 25:05.980* :  are going to be effective.
*25:05.980- 25:09.520* :  We'll feel that they impacted this because a lot of small farming communities
*25:09.960- 25:10.840* :  are dependent on this.
*25:10.920- 25:13.680* :  And of course even the operations within the de facto capital,
*25:13.680- 25:15.820* :  which hosts lots of displaced people
*25:16.240- 25:18.120* :  and the humanitarian organizations plus,
*25:18.540- 25:21.260* :  are the Sudanese army's operations in that city.
*25:21.260- 25:23.240* :  So we're going to see lots of impacts,
*25:23.240- 25:25.540* :  especially when it comes even to the war.
*25:25.940- 25:28.160* :  Our Africa Regional Editor Richard Kigoe.
*25:28.820- 25:30.900* :  The power Olympics begin in Paris on Wednesday,
*25:30.900- 25:35.300* :  and Ukraine's team will be hoping to continue their remarkable success story.
*25:35.860- 25:38.400* :  They finish near the top of the metal table at recent games,
*25:38.400- 25:42.440* :  but their preparations for Paris have been badly affected by the war with Russia.
*25:43.120- 25:45.220* :  And he Swiss has been to meet some of the contenders
*25:45.220- 25:47.440* :  as they trained, starting with the swimmers.
*25:48.520- 25:51.280* :  He's one of Ukraine's biggest Paralympic hopes.
*25:53.140- 25:55.260* :  Danilo Chuferov, who's visually impaired,
*25:55.740- 25:59.760* :  survived three weeks of shelling before his house was destroyed.
*26:03.460- 26:04.380* :  I was ready to die.
*26:04.840- 26:05.920* :  I hoped I would survive,
*26:06.440- 26:10.200* :  but the probability of dying was so high that you just put up with it.
*26:12.100- 26:13.420* :  Over the last 20 years,
*26:13.500- 26:16.480* :  Ukraine's Paralympians have become heroes at home,
*26:16.880- 26:19.180* :  one of the most successful teams in the world.
*26:20.020- 26:24.020* :  But they say around 500 of their sports facilities have been destroyed.
*26:25.560- 26:27.900* :  Chuferov now trains here in Idenipro,
*26:28.220- 26:30.520* :  where he's often interrupted by air raid sirens.
*26:31.380- 26:33.060* :  Many athletes have had to move abroad.
*26:33.660- 26:37.320* :  Fencer Andre Demchuk has been training in Poland with their team,
*26:37.920- 26:39.100* :  but he's gone back to Ukraine
*26:39.100- 26:40.960* :  where he speaks to injured soldiers
*26:41.420- 26:43.620* :  about adapting to life with a prosthetic.
*26:45.860- 26:48.300* :  He's even delivered jeeps to help the war effort,
*26:48.780- 26:51.980* :  driving them with a little help from his fencing sword.
*26:52.920- 26:56.780* :  I have only one normal leg and three paddles.
*26:56.900- 27:01.920* :  And for me, I can help with broken epi or foil
*27:02.420- 27:08.420* :  and push the clutch after I can push my left leg.
*27:09.040- 27:10.080* :  To another two paddles.
*27:11.120- 27:12.020* :  This is a little problem.
*27:13.340- 27:15.880* :  Every day, all what I do,
*27:16.500- 27:18.080* :  I do for my country.
*27:18.620- 27:19.700* :  At the Paris Olympics,
*27:20.520- 27:23.360* :  15 Russian athletes took part as neutrals.
*27:23.720- 27:25.080* :  They're only meddling tennis,
*27:25.760- 27:26.700* :  but at the Paris Olympics,
*27:27.200- 27:28.960* :  90 are set to compete.
*27:29.740- 27:31.460* :  For Ukrainian swimmer Anna Haunter,
*27:31.900- 27:34.060* :  who had to move to Finland after the invasion,
*27:34.560- 27:36.660* :  facing them will not be easy.
*27:38.320- 27:41.620* :  I will try to close my emotion,
*27:41.620- 27:43.660* :  but I don't know how it will be going.
*27:44.060- 27:47.960* :  Will it give you an extra motivation to win in the Paris Olympics?
*27:48.500- 27:48.680* :  Yes.
*27:48.920- 27:51.800* :  I want to fight for Ukrainian,
*27:51.800- 27:53.740* :  for my family,
*27:54.640- 27:57.120* :  for our Olympic team,
*27:58.400- 27:59.360* :  and I want to fight.
*28:00.180- 28:02.300* :  That challenge has never been greater,
*28:02.720- 28:03.800* :  but Ukraine will be hoping
*28:03.800- 28:06.920* :  that their Paralympic success story can continue
*28:07.600- 28:08.740* :  against all the odds.
*28:09.380- 28:10.400* :  Andy Swiss reporting.
*28:11.000- 28:13.520* :  Video games often feature heroes and villains
*28:13.520- 28:16.500* :  without standing or even supernatural abilities,
*28:17.080- 28:20.320* :  not characters from Welsh folklore, though, until now.
*28:20.840- 28:22.660* :  The classic collection of Welsh folk tales,
*28:22.660- 28:25.520* :  the Mabinocheon, has been used as the inspiration
*28:25.520- 28:27.280* :  for a new Canadian video game.
*28:27.720- 28:30.040* :  The tales were collected 800 years ago,
*28:30.080- 28:33.280* :  although some of them date back hundreds or even thousands of years more,
*28:33.880- 28:35.900* :  and some of the protagonists will be starring
*28:35.900- 28:39.140* :  in a new computer game developed by Stephen Anastasov,
*28:39.360- 28:41.020* :  who stumbled across the book while delving
*28:41.020- 28:42.460* :  into his own Welsh heritage.
*28:43.020- 28:45.020* :  Our reporter, Melary Williams, went to meet him.
*28:52.260- 28:53.320* :  Mythical characters,
*28:53.320- 28:56.000* :  Praderi, Branwen and Bloddeweith
*28:56.340- 28:58.760* :  may be familiar to many here in Wales.
*28:59.480- 29:01.940* :  The Welsh tales of the Mabinocheon date back
*29:01.940- 29:04.620* :  to around the 12th and 13th centuries,
*29:05.160- 29:07.040* :  and the characters are about to enter
*29:07.040- 29:09.200* :  a new world of video games.
*29:10.060- 29:12.540* :  There's Welsh heritage in my family.
*29:12.660- 29:16.160* :  From Canada, here's the developer, Stephen Anastasov.
*29:16.360- 29:19.180* :  There are some really good interpretations,
*29:19.320- 29:20.940* :  kind of more accessible interpretations,
*29:21.060- 29:22.380* :  but not a lot.
*29:22.860- 29:26.220* :  It's hard to find, you really need to look
*29:26.240- 29:28.080* :  if you're trying to find something a bit more accessible
*29:28.080- 29:30.880* :  in terms of an interpretation of the Mabinocheon.
*29:32.140- 29:34.880* :  So I think certainly doing it in the video game format
*29:36.020- 29:38.260* :  brings it to a whole different type of audience.
*29:40.500- 29:44.080* :  And from Canada to a studio in the Swansea Valley,
*29:44.220- 29:47.800* :  Phil Roe from Estelavera has been voicing the script.
*29:48.240- 29:50.480* :  Stephen contacted me out of the blue,
*29:50.480- 29:52.540* :  really, I think he'd stumbled across my website.
*29:54.480- 29:56.480* :  So he explained it was a Welsh language game.
*29:56.720- 29:58.820* :  It was quite exciting that it was the Mabinocheon.
*30:00.000- 30:02.480* :  So I jumped at the chance really to work with him,
*30:02.480- 30:05.340* :  and of course, him having worked on Assassin's Creed.
*30:05.340- 30:08.380* :  And so it was quite exciting to work on.
*30:08.380- 30:10.880* :  My fall of Behe-Lindyna Ganol.
*30:11.200- 30:13.460* :  So how much of a milestone is this
*30:13.680- 30:15.480* :  to the characters of the Mabinocheon?
*30:16.120- 30:19.300* :  Here's Professor Shone Davis from Cardiff University.
*30:19.360- 30:22.820* :  I think it's very important that we preserve these stories
*30:23.140- 30:24.340* :  in popular culture.
*30:24.760- 30:25.480* :  I think it's a wonderful idea,
*30:25.540- 30:27.480* :  especially since it's going to be in Welsh only
*30:27.480- 30:29.900* :  with the subtitles, because that's going to give a platform
*30:30.280- 30:32.060* :  to the Welsh language as well internationally.
*30:32.580- 30:35.240* :  I think it's important that we respect the origin of the stories
*30:35.240- 30:37.960* :  that we continue with our research into the stories,
*30:37.960- 30:38.900* :  academic research.
*30:39.280- 30:41.480* :  But it's so important that these stories live on.
*30:41.960- 30:44.480* :  And in order to live on, they must adapt.
*30:47.940- 30:50.440* :  In a games club for Welsh speakers in Swansea,
*30:50.620- 30:53.400* :  there's excitement ahead of the launch of the video game
*30:53.440- 30:54.480* :  next spring.
*30:54.880- 30:57.120* :  It's really exciting to see Welsh culture
*30:57.120- 30:59.560* :  and Welsh language in a video game,
*30:59.760- 31:01.420* :  as far as I'm aware, it's never been number four.
*31:01.920- 31:02.920* :  So that's really exciting.
*31:02.920- 31:06.120* :  I think for everybody who plays video games
*31:06.120- 31:08.540* :  and is interested in Welsh culture and language.
*31:09.100- 31:10.900* :  I guess the thing is everyone has different interests.
*31:11.540- 31:14.320* :  And like, you know, for some people,
*31:14.320- 31:18.220* :  it might be books in Welsh that helps them to kind of get into it.
*31:18.220- 31:19.060* :  For some people, it might be,
*31:19.380- 31:20.500* :  I've heard a lot of people saying, like,
*31:20.500- 31:21.440* :  listening to the radio.
*31:21.500- 31:24.760* :  Honestly, in Welsh, like, just on the way to work,
*31:24.760- 31:26.840* :  it really helps them, like, get into that headspace.
*31:26.840- 31:29.480* :  So this is great for the people who obviously
*31:29.480- 31:30.840* :  entered video games.
*31:30.840- 31:34.040* :  Because what I know is not a lot of that up there.
*31:36.940- 31:39.100* :  Opening another industry's eyes
*31:39.240- 31:41.100* :  to a Welsh mythical treasure
*31:41.740- 31:44.460* :  from Canada to Wales and beyond.
*31:46.440- 31:47.640* :  Battery Williams reporting.
*31:50.020- 31:51.140* :  And that's all from us for now.
