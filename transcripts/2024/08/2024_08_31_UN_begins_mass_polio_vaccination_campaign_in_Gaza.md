*01:32.440- 01:36.320* :  I'm Chris Barrow and in the early hours of Sunday, the first of September, these are our main
*01:36.320- 01:41.120* :  stories. The United Nations is to begin a mass polio vaccination campaign in Gaza.
*01:41.760- 01:45.580* :  A weight loss drug shows signs of helping with a number of other serious medical conditions,
*01:46.260- 01:49.900* :  and the unusual role-wedding in Norway between a princess and a shaman.
*01:52.740- 01:57.760* :  Also in the podcast, I remember googling how to teach an armless man how to shoot a bow,
*01:58.080- 02:02.980* :  and there was nothing online on how to do it, so I had to teach myself.
*02:03.740- 02:07.480* :  We'll meet the so-called armless archer competing of this year's Paralympic Games
*02:07.480- 02:12.460* :  and a preview of a documentary featuring the Canadian rock band that united a nation through song.
*02:17.100- 02:21.180* :  A mass polio vaccination campaign begins in earnest today in the Gaza Strip.
*02:21.520- 02:25.140* :  The move was made possible because Israel and Hamas have agreed to what they call
*02:25.140- 02:30.360* :  localized pauses in the fighting. These parents were among the first to get their children immunized.
*02:32.460- 02:36.980* :  Given the overpopulation of displaced people and the spread of polluted,
*02:37.160- 02:42.360* :  undrinkable water and sewage on the streets, this poses a great danger to our children,
*02:43.080- 02:46.640* :  especially given the appearance of the first case of polio in Gaza.
*02:47.240- 02:51.520* :  The families were afraid, and I was afraid for my child who's 11 months old.
*02:52.180- 02:55.540* :  I even came today to give him the vaccination as part of this campaign.
*02:58.340- 03:00.600* :  I'm glad that my daughter received a vaccination.
*03:00.600- 03:06.140* :  God willing, I will have all my children vaccinated and may God keep the disease away from us
*03:06.460- 03:07.460* :  and end this siege.
*03:10.380- 03:12.340* :  So just how bad is the situation in Gaza?
*03:12.660- 03:14.700* :  Our correspondent Yola Nell has this report.
*03:16.820- 03:21.940* :  Just two drops. As the UN begins vaccinating against polio in Gaza,
*03:22.400- 03:29.000* :  a dose is easy to give, but carrying out a mass immunization campaign here is a huge challenge.
*03:30.000- 03:34.460* :  Parents of the first vaccinated children, like Maru Al-Kut, say they're relieved.
*03:35.960- 03:40.240* :  I was worried and afraid, because this is scary, the polio disease.
*03:41.000- 03:43.140* :  This disease makes the children unable to move.
*03:45.900- 03:49.060* :  Levine Abu Jadjian looks back at a video of her baby.
*03:49.620- 03:54.280* :  He began crawling early, but now she worries he'll never be able to walk.
*03:54.960- 04:00.560* :  Abdul-Ruchman was the first child found to have polio in Gaza in 25 years,
*04:01.080- 04:02.440* :  and it paralyzed his leg.
*04:03.200- 04:05.300* :  Because of the war, he wasn't vaccinated.
*04:05.940- 04:09.500* :  And now his mom says he has limited access to medical care.
*04:11.240- 04:13.180* :  Abu wants to live and be treated.
*04:13.180- 04:15.900* :  He wants to live and walk like other children.
*04:15.900- 04:19.120* :  I feel a lot of guilt that he didn't get the vaccination,
*04:19.260- 04:22.560* :  but I couldn't give it to him because of our circumstances.
*04:23.220- 04:32.360* :  This place five times, the Abu Jadjian family now lives in a crowded tent camp in Dira-Balach
*04:32.540- 04:36.860* :  in central Gaza. War sewage flows through streets nearby.
*04:37.860- 04:44.740* :  In such insanitary conditions, diseases can spread easily, and polio is highly infectious.
*04:45.480- 04:50.760* :  Since discovering the virus, UN agencies have been racing to set up an emergency
*04:51.200- 04:52.760* :  mass vaccination program.
*04:55.780- 05:01.520* :  And with war raging, they've agreed three localized three-day pauses in fighting
*05:01.520- 05:08.720* :  with Israel and Hamas. Jonathan Cricks, local spokesman for UNICEF, tells me this is crucial.
*05:09.220- 05:14.080* :  You cannot lead and implement a polio vaccination campaign in an active combat zone.
*05:14.460- 05:19.940* :  It's simply impossible. Families needs to be feeling safe in bringing their babies,
*05:19.940- 05:26.080* :  their children to get the vaccines, but also the health care workers need to be able to safely
*05:26.080- 05:31.380* :  reach the communities. When it comes to having the rollout, why is it so important to have it
*05:31.380- 05:41.240* :  over a short time frame? We are aiming to have 640,000 children below the age of 10 vaccinated
*05:41.240- 05:48.380* :  in just a few days in the Gaza Strip for the vaccination campaign to be efficient
*05:48.440- 05:56.860* :  for the transmission to be stopped. We need to reach at least 90 percent of these 640,000
*05:56.860- 06:02.380* :  children. Without that, there is a risk that the virus would mutate and that the transmission
*06:02.380- 06:10.860* :  could continue. Children make up nearly half the population of Gaza, and the past year has
*06:10.860- 06:16.500* :  deprived many of their loved ones, their homes, and health, with no end in sight to the war.
*06:16.500- 06:21.440* :  The hope is that at least one new source of suffering can be eliminated.
*06:22.120- 06:27.200* :  Yolan Nell. The story dominating the front pages of many of Britain's newspapers this weekend
*06:27.380- 06:32.020* :  is research suggesting that the weight loss jab semi-glute hide can be used to reduce the
*06:32.020- 06:36.780* :  severity of other serious illnesses. Some health experts claim that the drug, branded as
*06:36.780- 06:42.600* :  a Zempick or Wigovie, could also slow down the ageing process. Dr Jeremy Samuel Faust from Harvard
*06:42.600- 06:46.300* :  Medical School has seen the study. He told Stephen Nolan more about it.
*06:46.620- 06:51.380* :  What we learned last year was that for people with heart disease, these drugs can actually
*06:51.380- 06:58.120* :  decrease mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and then the surprise was non-cardiovascular
*06:58.120- 07:03.900* :  diseases. That led investigators to look into whether some of these deaths had been COVID deaths,
*07:04.100- 07:08.700* :  and it turned out that patients who'd been on semi-glute hide for a couple of years when the
*07:08.700- 07:14.480* :  COVID pandemic started. Actually, when they went on to get COVID-19, died about a third less
*07:15.120- 07:19.200* :  than the people who'd been on placebo during that time. So, it has some pretty important
*07:19.200- 07:24.420* :  clinical effects. You know, the big one, I think, is appetite suppression. It slows down the rate
*07:24.440- 07:28.840* :  of the stomach kind of pushing things forward into the small intestine, and that just makes people
*07:28.840- 07:34.380* :  want to eat less. And when they eat less, their metabolic demands really change, and over time,
*07:34.380- 07:39.380* :  that has tremendous health benefits. Their metabolic demands. Is that fancy talk for hunger?
*07:40.000- 07:45.980* :  No, not exactly. Hunger is what drives us just to eat, and if we eat too much, our bodies have
*07:45.980- 07:51.380* :  to process that, and so our metabolic rate changes to process all the calories coming into our body.
*07:51.800- 07:56.680* :  So, if we overeat, that leads to build up of all kinds of inflammation, which can cause heart
*07:56.680- 08:00.940* :  disease, can cause kidney disease, can cause diabetes. These drugs do the opposite. They say,
*08:00.940- 08:06.640* :  look, we're full. Therefore, over time, how much energy we are burning, how much we're taking in
*08:06.640- 08:12.160* :  goes down, and as a result of that, these inflammatory pathways that can cause always various
*08:12.160- 08:17.300* :  diseases, is reduced dramatically. There are risks with most drugs. What are the side effects?
*08:17.940- 08:22.620* :  First of all, I'll say with any drug, there are benefits, and there are possible side effects,
*08:22.760- 08:27.600* :  and you always want to balance those. And with these compounds, I will say, I'm unusually
*08:27.600- 08:32.400* :  encouraged, because we keep seeing that the benefits are incredibly important ones,
*08:32.900- 08:37.740* :  decreased heart attacks, decreased mortality, now even COVID mortality reduced. These are
*08:37.740- 08:43.480* :  incredible benefits. Now, nothing comes without a risk. We have from these trials, and we have also
*08:43.480- 08:49.320* :  from observational data afterwards, that the most common side effect is nausea, gastrointestinal
*08:49.320- 08:53.940* :  of discomfort, mostly during the early phases. So, people can get inflammation of the pancreas.
*08:53.940- 08:58.640* :  This is not pancreatic cancer, it's just a pancreatitis. That seems to have been a little higher in
*08:58.640- 09:03.180* :  people who took this drug, and sometimes people will have other conditions like their intestines
*09:03.180- 09:08.100* :  temporarily stop pushing things through. But again, these are self-limited. We haven't seen any
*09:08.100- 09:13.800* :  major side effects that would cause alarm when on the other side of the ledger is a decrease in
*09:13.800- 09:19.420* :  heart attacks, is a decrease in mortality. Have they been around long enough for us to be
*09:19.420- 09:25.380* :  confident in terms of the dangers? Do we know enough about these drugs? I think that with any
*09:25.380- 09:31.420* :  drug, we want to see long-term follow-up. What we have so far is quite a bit more than usual
*09:31.420- 09:35.500* :  for a quote-unquote blockbuster, because these drugs have been around in earlier generations
*09:35.520- 09:39.940* :  for diabetes. So, we've been seeing for over a decade now, these patients do quite well.
*09:40.300- 09:44.840* :  Who's to say that 30 years from now, something might not crop up? But what's so unusual here,
*09:45.100- 09:49.200* :  is that right now, the benefit is not some decrease in something like your cholesterol level,
*09:49.200- 09:52.680* :  and who knows what that means, or your blood pressure level, which you'd like it to be lower,
*09:52.680- 09:57.180* :  but who knows what that adds to your daily risk. The benefits we're seeing in certain patients
*09:57.180- 10:02.320* :  is life or death. They don't die as much. So, if 30 years from now, it turns out that there's some
*10:02.320- 10:06.500* :  increase in something that we don't like. That'll have a very steep climb to overcome all the
*10:06.500- 10:11.120* :  benefits today. So, I'm unusually optimistic. That doesn't mean that something's not going to crop
*10:11.120- 10:16.100* :  up. And the caveat, of course, is that if there are patients who wouldn't benefit from this in the
*10:16.100- 10:19.940* :  same way, they won't have that mortality benefit because they're already fairly healthy. Then,
*10:19.940- 10:23.380* :  what you're doing is you're putting those people at risk because, as you say, who's to say
*10:23.380- 10:27.640* :  20 years from now, what will happen to people who take it, and if their lives weren't saved,
*10:27.900- 10:30.220* :  what did they get? So, that's a very important thing that we're watching.
*10:30.880- 10:34.160* :  That was the emergency medicine specialist, Dr. Jeremy Samuel Faust.
*10:34.840- 10:39.940* :  In Hinduism, cows are revered as a symbol of unselfish giving, motherhood, and strength.
*10:40.500- 10:45.720* :  A cow's often seen roaming freely amongst the traffic of busy roads and streets. Eating meat and
*10:45.720- 10:50.780* :  specifically beef is considered by some to be offensive. In India, railway officials are
*10:50.780- 10:55.340* :  investigating a video, which has gone viral, showing an elderly man being assaulted on a train
*10:55.420- 10:59.860* :  because he's believed to be carrying a jar of beef. The details from Lipika Pelin.
*11:03.320- 11:08.060* :  The video shows the man with a white beard wearing a long traditional Islamic shirt
*11:08.060- 11:13.840* :  surrounded by about a dozen young men in a trained compartment. Some of them hit him around the
*11:13.840- 11:20.740* :  face, asking him to show what he's carrying. Others hurl abuse. Some ask for his mobile phone.
*11:20.740- 11:27.100* :  The man who's clutching a jar appears disorientated. railway police said have identified the victim
*11:27.100- 11:33.700* :  as Haji Ashraf Munir from Jalgaon district in Maharashtra, and also some of the men involved in
*11:33.700- 11:39.580* :  their salt. Indian media say a number of suspects have been detained after a police team visited
*11:39.580- 11:44.780* :  Haji Munir's home and recorded his statement. The investigation continues.
*11:45.580- 11:50.640* :  Cows are sacred in Hinduism, and there have been frequent attacks by hard-line Hindu groups and
*11:50.640- 11:56.500* :  people accused of killing the animals for meat. The sale and consumption of beef are restricted
*11:56.500- 12:01.740* :  in some parts of India by local governments, but Hindu nationalists have been demanding a complete
*12:01.740- 12:07.240* :  nationwide ban on the slaughter of cows. Now as the first weekend of the Paralympics in Paris,
*12:07.240- 12:12.860* :  an archery is one of the sports taking centre stage. One of the athletes is Matt Stutzman of the
*12:12.860- 12:18.500* :  United States, affectionately known as the armless archer. He was born without arms and competes
*12:18.500- 12:22.600* :  by using his mouth to pull back the bowstring while holding the main bow with his foot.
*12:23.220- 12:28.140* :  The 41-year-old holds a world record for the longest accurate shot. Our sports presenter,
*12:28.140- 12:31.860* :  Nishat Ladder, wanted to know what made Matt decide to take up archery.
*12:32.560- 12:40.540* :  I remember this very clearly in 2010. I was a stay-at-home dad. I can't find a job. I go apply
*12:40.540- 12:46.680* :  places and nobody hires me. I had one person tell me if I had prosthetic arms, he would hire me,
*12:46.680- 12:51.780* :  and I remember that day going home and thinking like, I just need somebody to give me a chance how
*12:51.780- 12:56.860* :  am I going to put food on the table for my kids, and as I'm sitting there on TV, a guy is shooting
*12:56.860- 13:06.920* :  a bow, and my brain said, Matt, do that. I'm like, okay, so I remember googling how to teach
*13:06.920- 13:14.060* :  an armless man how to shoot a bow, and there was nothing online on how to do it. So I had to
*13:14.060- 13:20.340* :  teach myself. And you won silver at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, didn't you? So what is your
*13:20.340- 13:27.900* :  goal for Paris? Can you take the next step, perhaps, to a gold medal? I believe my skill is there
*13:27.900- 13:33.420* :  to win a medal. But what's amazing about this Games for me is that I caught the history games.
*13:33.500- 13:37.960* :  That's because my family is here for the first time. They will be supporting me. They'll be in
*13:37.960- 13:43.180* :  the stands. My boys first time for them flying on a plane in an international trip. And on top of
*13:43.180- 13:48.780* :  that, there are three other armless people at this event competing that I have helped get here.
*13:49.160- 13:54.800* :  So for me, it's not necessarily about winning a gold medal. It's about doing my best and making
*13:54.800- 14:00.460* :  memories. And if it works out that I shoot good and I win a medal, then that's just the bonus.
*14:00.860- 14:07.080* :  You live in Iowa. And I understand you've been practicing at your home using a backdrop of the
*14:07.080- 14:13.880* :  Esplanadez Envalid, which is the venue for archery. Is that right? I believe that mental preparation
*14:13.880- 14:19.960* :  is important. Once I found out where it was going to be, we actually flew over to bring awareness
*14:19.960- 14:25.940* :  to the Paralympic Games a year or so out. And when I was over here, I went to the venue and I saw
*14:25.940- 14:31.280* :  what it was. And I was able to mentally soak up all the noises and the sounds and the wind and the
*14:31.760- 14:36.760* :  grass and the people. And then when I went home, I tried to create that in my house. So when I got
*14:36.760- 14:42.360* :  here, it really felt like home. And there are four armless archers at these games. The first time
*14:42.360- 14:48.520* :  in history, it seems you've really opened doors in this sport mat. Can I even perhaps describe you
*14:48.740- 14:54.960* :  as a mentor to the next generation of paraathletes? Archery has given me so much that it's kind of my
*14:54.960- 15:01.120* :  way of giving back. And if I can help other armless archers feel how I felt, whether it's winning a
*15:01.120- 15:06.960* :  medal or competing for their country, just that feeling alone gives them confidence in normal life
*15:06.960- 15:12.940* :  stuff. And if I can give them that, how I feel and how felt at previous games and this games,
*15:12.940- 15:18.040* :  then I want them to experience it. So I don't know if it's a mentorship really, but just taking them
*15:18.040- 15:23.920* :  under my wing a little bit. The Paralympic Archer Matt Stutzman. The raw weddings tend to follow a
*15:23.920- 15:29.160* :  pretty predictable template, grand church halls, carefully followed traditions, and centuries-old
*15:29.160- 15:34.780* :  family values. But in Norway, they're doing things differently. Princess Martha Louise has just
*15:34.780- 15:39.340* :  married her black American partner, Derek Verrett, and it's certainly ruffled a few feathers.
*15:39.980- 15:44.860* :  He's a self-described shaman who says he's risen from the dead. Guests have been told to dress
*15:44.860- 15:50.460* :  according to the theme, which is sexy and cool. Lena House is an Norwegian journalist who was
*15:50.460- 15:54.860* :  outside the hotel where the wedding party took place, and she'd just spoken to the happy couple.
*15:55.540- 16:00.120* :  They were so happy. They were thanking all the people who showed off outside a hotel and
*16:00.120- 16:05.720* :  greeting them as a newlywed couple, but Princess Martha Louise, she was not too happy with us at
*16:05.720- 16:11.100* :  the press. She tends to dislike us a bit, and she was like, please get out of the way. I want to
*16:11.100- 16:15.500* :  talk to the people and not the press. And just tell us a little bit about the background of this
*16:15.500- 16:20.240* :  wedding, because they both seem to be quite unusual characters. All they do, yeah. So Princess Martha
*16:20.240- 16:25.380* :  Louise is definitely one of the more unusual royal characters in Norway. When she was a bit younger,
*16:25.380- 16:30.980* :  she told everyone that she was speaking to angels, and she made an angel school where she
*16:30.980- 16:36.200* :  taught other people to speak to angels, and she called it like overly sensitive people who have
*16:36.280- 16:42.100* :  the ability to talk to angels, and she married the shaman Durek Vettits, who has made some
*16:42.100- 16:47.700* :  pretty controversial saying. One thing he said is that he has a method that he can remove
*16:47.700- 16:53.380* :  imprints from girls with kindness so that you don't like to have the imprints of people you've
*16:53.380- 16:58.080* :  had sex with. So some of his sayings are a bit controversial, and we write a lot about him
*16:58.080- 17:02.600* :  hearing Norway. Yeah, I think he also sells a medallion that's supposed to cure cancer or something
*17:02.600- 17:09.500* :  along those lines. So unusual couple, how is this marriage being seen by the people who, you know,
*17:09.500- 17:12.260* :  she shoved the journalists out the way and wanted to talk to them, are they happy about this,
*17:12.260- 17:16.920* :  this marriage? I think it's a bit of both. You know, some people really like her, you know, she's
*17:16.920- 17:22.620* :  very spiritual, and she's also a very good sportsman. She's a very good writer. She has been
*17:22.620- 17:28.440* :  writing horses professionally, so some people really like her, but a lot of people also think she
*17:28.440- 17:32.860* :  could throw shade on the monarchy when she says what she says, and she does what she does, and
*17:33.200- 17:37.920* :  the whole wedding, the public hasn't been able to take part of it. They have closed the doors,
*17:37.960- 17:43.260* :  so at only time the public have seen the newlyweds or when they went outside to say hello to them,
*17:43.260- 17:48.180* :  other than that, the public has had no part of the wedding. The Norwegian journalist Lena House.
*17:51.080- 17:54.220* :  Still to come? What the danger might be is that people have what's called a
*17:54.220- 17:58.980* :  discrimination of expectation response. So your brain's predicted, when I pull a piece of that
*17:58.980- 18:03.900* :  chocolate into my mouth, I'm going to get a rich orange flavor. If it's not there, that is normally
*18:03.900- 18:09.280* :  a bad thing. If the makers of Terry's chocolate orange provoke controversy among aficionados
*18:09.640- 18:11.720* :  by offering a version without the orange flavor.

*19:27.880- 19:32.540* :  The dispute between China and the Philippines over contested waters in the South China Sea
*19:32.540- 19:37.560* :  has deepened over the last two years. Now, for the second time in two weeks, both sides have
*19:37.560- 19:42.580* :  angrily blamed each other for the latest collision between their ships. Our Asia Pacific editor,
*19:42.580- 19:48.520* :  Celia Hatton, told Rachel Wright what happened. It's a bit of a two-sided tale. The Chinese
*19:48.520- 19:54.520* :  Coast Guard came out with a statement saying that a Philippine ship in the Sabina shawl had deliberately
*19:54.580- 20:00.400* :  crushed into a Chinese vessel. They were very clear that that's what had happened. But shortly
*20:00.400- 20:06.820* :  after, Manila came out with almost a mirror copy of the story saying that a Chinese ship had
*20:06.820- 20:12.460* :  deliberately crushed into a Philippine ship. So they're just accusing each other of wrongdoing
*20:12.460- 20:18.440* :  here. And it really is the second almost mirror incident in less than two weeks on the Sabina
*20:18.440- 20:23.300* :  shawl. Now, as you say, this is a really old dispute. What's important here, though? It's in a
*20:23.300- 20:29.420* :  new location. The Sabina shawl really before now wasn't of much interest. But just a few months ago,
*20:29.420- 20:36.420* :  Philippine sailors discovered piles of crushed coral that they say China had been building up.
*20:36.440- 20:41.760* :  They're very suspicious that they believe that China is trying to build a base there on this
*20:41.760- 20:47.320* :  shawl, which they say is in Philippine water. So there are escalating worries that this really
*20:47.320- 20:52.580* :  could lead to some kind of ongoing military dispute. So how worried should we be if this is the
*20:52.580- 20:58.540* :  second time in two weeks? We should be concerned. I mean, the South China Sea itself is under dispute.
*20:58.540- 21:05.140* :  China has claims to 90% of the sea, but we have a dispute with the Philippines. We've got disputes
*21:05.140- 21:11.460* :  with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, all claim parts of the sea, also the self-ruled island of Taiwan
*21:11.460- 21:17.220* :  claims parts of the sea. The sea itself is incredibly important. It's home to mineral resources,
*21:17.220- 21:23.060* :  about a third of global trade passes through the South China Sea. So we really need to be concerned
*21:23.060- 21:27.240* :  that this latest dispute between China and the Philippines has heated up. But other countries
*21:27.240- 21:33.480* :  are watching on anxiously. Celia Hatton. Residents of Ukraine's second largest city are on
*21:33.480- 21:38.240* :  high alert after Friday's attack by Russia, which killed a 14-year-old girl in a playground.
*21:38.880- 21:43.440* :  Harkiv in the northeast of the country has been the target of frequent assaults since Moscow's
*21:43.440- 21:49.600* :  full-scale invasion in February 2022. Anastasia heard the sound of the missiles raining down while she
*21:49.600- 21:53.540* :  was at home with her two-year-old daughter. Least you said asked her what was going through her
*21:53.540- 22:00.220* :  mind during the latest attack. I could clearly hear at the moments of missiles hitting the ground
*22:00.220- 22:08.160* :  and wherever they hit, which was quite loud, despite all the noise of traffic and life going on.
*22:09.000- 22:15.980* :  People are not getting tired. They are tired. They've been tired of it for many, many months already.
*22:16.460- 22:21.200* :  It's just hard to draw this line between where you're just tired or whether you're just
*22:21.220- 22:28.600* :  desperate, aware, angry. It's a mixture of lots of negative emotions put together.
*22:29.240- 22:34.400* :  You know, it's now more than two years that this has been going on. And as you say,
*22:34.400- 22:39.280* :  you're living in a city which has been directly affected. Does it change people's view on the
*22:39.280- 22:45.300* :  course of this war that calls to President Zelensky to end it politically if it can't be
*22:45.300- 22:52.120* :  ended militarily? Does it have that impact? When an attack like yesterday comes along,
*22:52.120- 23:00.080* :  thoughts like, let's call for peace talks, let's just sign some pact of an on-attack in each other.
*23:00.340- 23:04.760* :  All those thoughts they are dismissed from entirely when you see the number of victims and
*23:04.760- 23:12.040* :  casualties growing and growing. All you feel is a surge of anger rising from deep down within you,
*23:12.740- 23:21.900* :  anger and some uncontrolled rage and despair. It is despair to the word peace. It kind of gets
*23:21.900- 23:28.640* :  erased from your even thoughts. All you think about is, is it safe to come outside now?
*23:29.100- 23:33.700* :  What can they do? Is there anyone needing my help at the moment? This is what actually you think
*23:33.700- 23:42.980* :  about. Do you support the decision by President Zelensky and Ukrainian armed forces to focus their
*23:42.980- 23:49.880* :  effort, their resources across the border to go into Russia's Kurdish region? I believe that if
*23:49.880- 23:57.840* :  that helps to prevent further attacks on our settlements, on towns close to the border,
*23:58.160- 24:04.860* :  might seem included. With my heart, it gives me a sort of negatively pleasant feeling,
*24:05.520- 24:12.200* :  maybe thinking that, let them feel what it's like to have war come to their land, which is not,
*24:12.200- 24:18.820* :  of course, the right thing to feel. Anastasia speaking to Lee's do set. The Toronto International
*24:18.820- 24:23.960* :  Film Festival starts this week showcasing the best in global film. And one of those hoping to
*24:23.960- 24:29.100* :  capture the attention of audiences is no dress rehearsal, a documentary shining a light on the
*24:29.100- 24:34.440* :  band lorded as Canada's answer to the Beatles. The tragically hip, sometimes known as the hip,
*24:34.440- 24:40.280* :  have sold millions of records worldwide. But in 2016, frontman Gord Downey was diagnosed with
*24:40.280- 24:44.960* :  a brain tumour. Megan Lawton has been speaking to his brother Mike, who directed the film.
*24:46.100- 24:52.360* :  Canada isn't immune to creating megastars, from Leonard Cohen and Shania Twain to Justin Bieber and
*24:52.360- 24:58.560* :  Drake. But there's one band who've encapsulated their home country in a way other artists haven't,
*25:06.480- 25:11.580* :  the tragically hip. During a mammoth 33 year career, the band had nine number one albums in Canada
*25:12.000- 25:17.200* :  and became synonymous with the country through their lyrics and efforts to play its most remote towns
*25:17.200- 25:23.060* :  and cities. It takes forever to get out of Ontario. It takes 18 hours driving. We'd be leaving
*25:23.060- 25:27.760* :  after the show and have to drive all night. Paul Langua played guitar in the band. We felt
*25:27.760- 25:31.660* :  that appreciation, especially like you're going to Newfoundland a lot of bands. They have to cut
*25:31.660- 25:38.580* :  that out. It's just too far. I think they want another song, Paul. In return for their efforts,
*25:38.580- 25:44.480* :  Canadians bought to the band's music and showed up at their gigs. This dedication was amplified
*25:44.480- 25:50.280* :  in 2016 when their lead singer, Gord Downey, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
*25:56.000- 26:01.780* :  The band's final gig was streamed by over 11 million people, a third of the population,
*26:01.780- 26:07.980* :  making it one of Canada's most watched events. In the days after Gord's passing, venues around
*26:07.980- 26:20.200* :  the nation dimmed their lights. Hockey games paused to pay tribute and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
*26:20.200- 26:28.600* :  wept on television. Gord was my friend, but Gord was everyone's friends, who we were, our buddy Gord.
*26:29.140- 26:34.520* :  It's this journey of how a small town band became national treasures that's now the focus of a
*26:34.520- 26:40.240* :  four-part documentary No Address rehearsal. It was directed by the late Gord Downey's brother,
*26:40.620- 26:45.420* :  Mike Downey. When it was wrapping up earlier this year, it made me sad because it had been a
*26:45.420- 26:50.060* :  constant companion. Makes me emotional, actually, just thinking about that. Yeah, it made me miss my
*26:50.060- 26:55.420* :  brother. It made me appreciate him. Despite being so well loved, the tragically hip or a band that
*26:55.420- 27:01.520* :  outside of Canada, he might not be familiar with. This documentary explores why. Starting with
*27:01.520- 27:06.820* :  Leeds Singer Gord's dedication to telling Canada's story, regardless of how well it played a broad.
*27:07.260- 27:13.720* :  Canada is kind of an enigmatic place when you say, what is it that makes a Canadian Canadian?
*27:14.100- 27:17.540* :  Without being the clichés of maple syrup, and as Gord would say,
*27:17.540- 27:23.600* :  doughnuts and hockey sticks. The result, a song's like 50 Mission Cap, which tells the true story
*27:23.600- 27:29.800* :  of Bill Barilco, a Canadian ice hockey player who died when his plane mysteriously disappeared.
*27:37.320- 27:44.780* :  And Wheat Kings, a song about David Milgard, a Canadian man who served 23 years in prison for crime he
*27:52.720- 27:58.740* :  didn't commit. There was just this sense in the audience of like, oh wow, you're singing about us,
*27:58.940- 28:04.100* :  like this is our moment. So often with artists, the goal is to break America, but that wasn't
*28:04.100- 28:10.020* :  top of the hips list. But as no dress rehearsal makes clear, the band chose their own road to the
*28:10.020- 28:16.140* :  states in a way that was authentic to them. We played all the best rooms, certainly in America and
*28:16.140- 28:22.320* :  certainly in Europe. I mean, we felt those successes and we were proud of them because it was kind
*28:22.320- 28:27.000* :  of like we're on our own. Despite going on to play Glastonbury and open for the Rolling Stones,
*28:27.000- 28:32.920* :  the hips music was mostly appreciated back home, but this documentary could change that and
*28:32.920- 28:39.780* :  introduce the band to new fans. That report by Megan Lawton and the Toronto Film Festival runs
*28:39.780- 28:46.000* :  from Friday the 6th of September to Sunday the 15th. As you probably know, companies love to tinker
*28:46.000- 28:52.480* :  with their products. Remember Green Ketchup or perhaps New Coke? That one lasted only 80 days.
*28:52.480- 28:58.680* :  Well now the chocolate here Terri's, founded in England in 1767, is about to launch an update to
*28:58.680- 29:03.760* :  an old favourite. You know, I'm the caring, sharing type. I mean, just the other night I caught
*29:03.760- 29:09.300* :  myself thinking, wouldn't it be nice to share this delicious Terri's chocolate orange with some of
*29:09.300- 29:16.720* :  my dearest chums? And then I thought, no, actually, no. Terri's chocolate orange. It's not Terri's,
*29:17.180- 29:22.000* :  it's mine. You know, now the company wants to introduce us to the delights of a chocolate orange
*29:22.760- 29:27.400* :  without the orange. And some people believe that our memories will still make us taste orange,
*29:27.400- 29:32.140* :  even if it isn't there. Sean Lay has been discussing this phenomenon with the experimental
*29:32.140- 29:38.160* :  psychologist Charles Spence. In most people come to know and love and expect a Terri's chocolate
*29:38.160- 29:42.780* :  orange that looks like an orange that is orange coloured to have an orange flavour and hence with
*29:42.780- 29:47.480* :  this new variant that doesn't have the orange flavour, what the danger might be is that people
*29:47.480- 29:52.160* :  have what's called a disconformation of expectation response. Where you're so convinced,
*29:52.200- 29:55.680* :  your brain's predicted, when I pull a piece of that chocolate into my mouth, I'm going to get a
*29:55.680- 30:01.000* :  rich chocolatey flavour. And if it's not there, then our brain has got it wrong and that is normally
*30:01.000- 30:05.320* :  a bad thing. And hence we like things less very often when our brain's got the predictions the
*30:05.320- 30:09.300* :  wrong way around. Now the chocolate orange or what's going to be called the milk chocolate ball
*30:09.300- 30:13.900* :  that's being experimented doesn't really have the same catchy sound, does it? It's not going to be
*30:13.900- 30:18.720* :  wrapped in an orange foil. So might that help with what our senses are picking up when they look at
*30:18.720- 30:23.020* :  this thing? If you're coming out with a not orange flavoured chocolate orange, then you're
*30:23.020- 30:25.900* :  packaging I don't know. You might think well why it's the thing to go with because it's got no
*30:25.900- 30:31.240* :  orange flavour or maybe black to make it look luxurious. But in fact they seem to have gone with blue
*30:31.240- 30:36.420* :  packaging. And to me that's very interesting because blue is one of the colours where we don't
*30:36.680- 30:41.760* :  really have many strong expectations what blue things should taste like. And hence it's an effective
*30:41.760- 30:47.120* :  way to introduce new flavours into the marketplace, colour them blue. So when people first see it,
*30:47.180- 30:51.840* :  they didn't know what to expect. And hence that can sometimes help to alleviate or prevent this
*30:51.840- 30:56.540* :  disconfirmation of expectation response and makes things taste bad. We talked about orange in terms
*30:56.540- 31:03.980* :  of the chocolate orange. I've also got here some smarties. I've got red one green pinky purple yellow
*31:03.980- 31:09.180* :  orange. Am I right in saying the orange ones only have an orange flavour in the UK and some other
*31:09.180- 31:13.000* :  countries and there's some countries where they don't like the orange flavour. What's that about?
*31:13.220- 31:17.860* :  We did an experiment where we had people and gave them different colours of smarties, the orange
*31:17.860- 31:22.440* :  ones and the brown ones in particular and asked them about the taste of other colours like the green one.
*31:22.640- 31:26.660* :  What was amazing is that people have some very strong beliefs about the flavour. They say,
*31:26.660- 31:30.980* :  you know, the green ones taste limey, that the red ones taste sweeter, that the brown
*31:30.980- 31:36.380* :  smarties taste chocolateier and that the orange ones really do taste of orange. But in fact the only
*31:36.380- 31:43.120* :  ones that might taste of the colour of their casing are the orange ones. And as you say in the UK,
*31:43.120- 31:48.840* :  the orange smarties really do have some orange flavouring whereas in Germany and many other countries,
*31:48.840- 31:54.180* :  they don't. And people when we gave them these orange looking but not orange flavoured smarties
*31:54.380- 31:58.240* :  and many people we still thought they tasted of orange even though they did not. So there's kind
*31:58.240- 32:02.460* :  of expectations that built up both from the colour of foods but also in the case of, I guess the
*32:02.460- 32:07.240* :  chocolate orange, it's the fact that it's an orange shape and it comes out as segments that
*32:07.240- 32:12.080* :  look like orange segments are all setting these strong expectations about what the taste of flavour
*32:12.080- 32:17.660* :  should be. I get why the chocolate orange sends a signal to the brain about what it might be like
*32:17.660- 32:22.140* :  because of the shape, the fact it's in segments like an orange is, it's all pointing in the same
*32:22.140- 32:30.280* :  direction. But here's another example, I'm just going to open the box and there's a foil wrapping
*32:30.280- 32:37.000* :  underneath. Well, this is a toberown, the shape of the toberown, very different from the chocolate
*32:37.000- 32:42.960* :  orange, does the shape affect our perception of what it's going to taste like? So these are
*32:42.960- 32:46.880* :  semantically meaningful shapes like a segment of orange but also more primitive than that, people
*32:46.880- 32:53.340* :  associate sweet tasting things with round shapes and angular shapes with bitter tasting foods.
*32:53.660- 32:58.260* :  And then when you taste sometimes those angular shaped chocolates do taste more bitter to you
*32:58.560- 33:03.140* :  than exactly the same formulation of chocolate when we present it as a sphere or
*33:03.140- 33:07.780* :  another kind of round shape instead. Is anyone else just really hungry now? That was the psychologist
*33:07.780- 33:14.420* :  Charles Spence. And that's all from us for now, there will be a new edition of the global news
