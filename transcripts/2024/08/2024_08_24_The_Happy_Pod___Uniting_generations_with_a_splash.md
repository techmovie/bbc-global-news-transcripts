*02:05.520- 02:07.940* :  If people wanted to, they took off their tops and their bras
*02:08.100- 02:11.320* :  and sat there with Mijora showing her exactly what you needed to do.
*02:11.440- 02:14.240* :  I was women supporting women at its best regardless of species
*02:15.380- 02:20.460* :  and how trusting her team helped Eva Buzo become the first person to swim
*02:20.460- 02:22.300* :  from Italy to Albania.
*02:22.640- 02:25.840* :  My name was like, the rock is just there but I couldn't say it
*02:25.960- 02:28.180* :  and that's what they were just getting me to swim into the darkness
*02:28.180- 02:29.700* :  and I said, like, are you mad?
*02:30.620- 02:34.100* :  Plus, the leopard who found a mate through online dating.
*02:34.780- 02:37.740* :  You're listening to The Happy Pod from the BBC World Service.
*02:43.200- 02:46.140* :  We start in Minnesota at a preschool with a difference.

*03:19.840- 03:20.280* :  82 years.
*03:22.380- 03:25.980* :  The tall seasons preschool, the children have daily interactions
*03:25.980- 03:28.880* :  with the seniors at a care home in the same building.
*03:28.880- 03:32.800* :  They call them grandmas and grandpas and every summer
*03:33.060- 03:35.960* :  the two generations gear up for a huge water fight.
*03:37.180- 03:39.420* :  What do you think is going to happen to the water wars?
*03:40.540- 03:43.980* :  Oh, I think a lot of people are going to get wet.
*03:50.180- 03:50.960* :  Green.
*03:51.780- 03:52.900* :  Good job.
*03:53.500- 03:53.540* :  Everybody.
*03:53.540- 03:54.300* :  Good job.
*03:54.500- 03:55.700* :  Everybody won.
*04:03.140- 04:03.920* :  The happy pods,
*04:03.920- 04:08.040* :  polygibs has been speaking to the preschool's director Sarah Kern
*04:08.500- 04:12.020* :  and started by asking the all-important question who usually wins.
*04:12.960- 04:14.260* :  It's hard to say.
*04:15.300- 04:17.180* :  It's very rare to have a group surrender.
*04:17.180- 04:20.660* :  Usually it's a draw and everyone's quite happy with that.
*04:20.740- 04:23.240* :  It just sort of ends when we finally run out of water
*04:23.240- 04:28.220* :  and everyone is absolutely drenched and that's kind of when we call it.
*04:28.260- 04:31.560* :  Water Wars has gained this wonderful reputation over the years
*04:31.560- 04:35.360* :  as this summer tradition that's just a wonderful experience and memory
*04:35.360- 04:36.680* :  for everyone involved.
*04:37.000- 04:40.180* :  Do you have a favorite memory from a previous motor war?
*04:40.400- 04:43.020* :  So many snapshots are running through my mind
*04:43.200- 04:45.120* :  of seniors just drenched.
*04:45.460- 04:47.120* :  We had a favorite grandpa.
*04:47.120- 04:49.020* :  His name was Grandpa Al.
*04:49.220- 04:53.320* :  I just remember him completely decked out from head to toe
*04:53.540- 04:56.620* :  in a shower cap goggles, a poncho,
*04:57.060- 04:59.360* :  just armed with his water blaster,
*04:59.720- 05:02.920* :  just laughing hysterically as he blasted the kids.
*05:02.920- 05:05.480* :  I think that's probably one of my favorite memories.
*05:05.980- 05:06.640* :  I love that.
*05:06.800- 05:09.340* :  Do the grandmas and grandpas have a lot to do
*05:09.340- 05:11.520* :  with the day-to-day schooling of the children?
*05:11.920- 05:12.780* :  Some more than others.
*05:13.060- 05:16.100* :  So we have our grandmas and grandpas
*05:16.120- 05:18.380* :  that are very special to the children
*05:18.420- 05:22.440* :  and we build a long-term relationship with those seniors.
*05:22.440- 05:24.960* :  So those are often our senior readers
*05:24.960- 05:28.280* :  who will come on a weekly basis to read to the children
*05:28.280- 05:29.980* :  to play games with the children.
*05:29.980- 05:34.320* :  And we also daily go up to the memory care units in the buildings.
*05:34.320- 05:37.280* :  So those people become very special to us
*05:37.320- 05:39.240* :  and that's a huge part of our curriculum.
*05:39.720- 05:41.740* :  Do you think that the children have a more enriched
*05:41.740- 05:44.040* :  preschool experience because of the elders?
*05:44.940- 05:44.960* :  Absolutely.
*05:44.960- 05:49.280* :  I can't say enough what an impact being with the seniors
*05:49.280- 05:50.360* :  has on the children.
*05:51.040- 05:54.200* :  I think both groups do for each other
*05:54.200- 05:57.620* :  something no other age group could possibly do for them.
*05:57.800- 05:59.640* :  The children bring to the seniors
*06:00.280- 06:04.040* :  that liveliness, that spontaneity, that excitement
*06:04.040- 06:05.680* :  that's missing from their lives.
*06:05.940- 06:09.260* :  And for the children, the seniors bring to them
*06:09.260- 06:11.180* :  that time and attention.
*06:11.920- 06:13.560* :  So when you see the two groups together,
*06:13.620- 06:15.040* :  it's really quite magical.
*06:15.340- 06:18.500* :  My hope is that it makes a lifelong impact for them
*06:18.500- 06:21.540* :  that they will continue to see seniors
*06:22.040- 06:25.600* :  as valuable people who have rich stories to tell.
*06:26.040- 06:30.940* :  In the past year or so, we started a program
*06:30.940- 06:32.420* :  with our alumni students.
*06:32.420- 06:35.620* :  So that group of teenagers, they come back
*06:35.740- 06:37.780* :  to the senior living building.
*06:37.780- 06:39.480* :  They do a group called tech buddies
*06:39.860- 06:42.280* :  and the seniors come with their cell phones
*06:42.280- 06:45.520* :  or their computers and ask the preschool alumni
*06:45.860- 06:46.560* :  tech questions.
*06:47.100- 06:50.540* :  What's the biggest life lesson a grandma or grandpa
*06:50.540- 06:52.720* :  has given to a child?
*06:53.000- 06:55.820* :  I think it gives the children an opportunity
*06:56.340- 06:58.520* :  to be seen in a different way.
*06:58.860- 07:01.140* :  And the seniors have this kind of radar
*07:01.140- 07:04.540* :  that they pick up on that when there's a need in a child
*07:04.540- 07:06.040* :  that maybe isn't being met.
*07:06.440- 07:08.780* :  So I think that's an ongoing lesson
*07:08.980- 07:12.220* :  that we don't always see someone's full potential.
*07:12.220- 07:14.580* :  And sometimes you have to be in a different context
*07:14.740- 07:16.020* :  or see them in a different way
*07:16.020- 07:18.240* :  to really get to know a person as a whole.
*07:18.400- 07:20.820* :  There must be so many smiles on people's faces
*07:20.820- 07:23.600* :  when the grandmas and grandpas are with the young children.
*07:24.120- 07:26.180* :  What's the feeling in the room when they're all together?
*07:26.540- 07:28.580* :  Gosh, it never gets old.
*07:29.580- 07:33.060* :  It never, I hope I never become desensitized
*07:33.100- 07:34.000* :  to the wonder of it.
*07:34.160- 07:35.540* :  It's to see it in action.
*07:36.000- 07:37.520* :  It brings people to tears.
*07:37.680- 07:40.540* :  The feeling is just one of joy
*07:40.540- 07:44.120* :  to see the senior's faces light up when they see the children
*07:44.120- 07:47.360* :  and to see the children rush over to their favorite seniors.
*07:48.040- 07:50.600* :  We always greet them with a hug or a handshake.
*07:50.600- 07:53.160* :  We teach the children to look the seniors in the eye
*07:53.160- 07:56.060* :  and say hello and to see that happening,
*07:56.060- 07:58.160* :  to see a child walking around a room,
*07:58.160- 08:01.380* :  giving hugs to each senior, especially the folks
*08:01.940- 08:04.700* :  like in memory care who really they don't get much
*08:05.140- 08:07.720* :  loving touch and to see their faces light up
*08:07.760- 08:08.960* :  when they see the children.
*08:09.500- 08:11.440* :  It's really magical, really is.
*08:12.360- 08:13.960* :  And you can hear more about the preschool
*08:13.960- 08:18.080* :  on their very own podcast called All Seasons All Stories,
*08:18.520- 08:19.920* :  which is created by Julie Strand.
*08:20.560- 08:21.940* :  And thank you to our listener Megan,
*08:22.160- 08:23.780* :  who emailed us about this story.
*08:25.380- 08:28.040* :  A group of breastfeeding mothers have been called in
*08:28.040- 08:30.980* :  to help another mother with her maternal behavior.
*08:31.680- 08:33.140* :  Mujah, the orangutan,
*08:33.140- 08:36.360* :  struggled to give her first two babies the care they needed.
*08:37.000- 08:39.620* :  A zoo in Ireland took matters into their own hands
*08:39.620- 08:42.560* :  and let Mujah learn from the experts themselves.
*08:43.540- 08:45.640* :  Lizzie Reeves is a clinical midwife
*08:45.640- 08:47.400* :  and a specialist in lactation
*08:47.680- 08:49.820* :  at the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin.
*08:50.400- 08:51.980* :  She helped arrange the experiment
*08:51.980- 08:54.500* :  and has been speaking to Valerie Sanderson.
*08:55.340- 08:57.360* :  A orangutan's are known to mirror human behavior.
*08:57.560- 08:59.040* :  Mujah had had two previous babies.
*08:59.040- 09:00.520* :  She didn't show any maternal instinct
*09:00.520- 09:02.000* :  both of the babies actually died.
*09:02.000- 09:04.360* :  So it was really important that this baby survives.
*09:04.420- 09:06.300* :  So we knew we had to do everything possible
*09:06.300- 09:08.480* :  to teach Mujah how to look after this baby
*09:08.860- 09:10.080* :  and to teach her how to breastfeed.
*09:10.300- 09:12.500* :  So you actually used human mothers?
*09:12.860- 09:14.420* :  We got human mothers in.
*09:14.460- 09:15.860* :  So mothers obviously, with small babies,
*09:15.960- 09:17.740* :  the youngest baby who actually came into the zoo
*09:17.740- 09:22.120* :  was a two-week-old baby, up to kind of 13, 14 month olds babies.
*09:22.320- 09:24.320* :  I work in a maternity hospital with a lot of young girls
*09:24.320- 09:24.960* :  who have babies.
*09:24.960- 09:27.660* :  So I contacted them, girls who are midwives,
*09:27.660- 09:28.900* :  Nick, you nurses, doctors,
*09:28.900- 09:30.680* :  we're all on board, they were really excited
*09:30.680- 09:31.900* :  because they're teaching breastfeeding
*09:31.900- 09:33.340* :  to the women in the hospital every day.
*09:33.540- 09:35.720* :  And then I contacted a local breastfeeding support group.
*09:35.940- 09:37.180* :  And by that afternoon,
*09:37.180- 09:39.640* :  I had pretty volunteers lined up to come into the zoo.
*09:39.740- 09:42.220* :  They came in, we started kind of by three days a week
*09:42.260- 09:43.880* :  and then by the time the baby was due,
*09:43.880- 09:45.500* :  there was women in every day demonstrating
*09:45.500- 09:47.140* :  to Mujah how to breastfeed.
*09:47.340- 09:49.500* :  And Mujah, the orangutan was really interested.
*09:49.500- 09:50.700* :  She was taking it all in.
*09:50.940- 09:51.800* :  It was amazing.
*09:52.000- 09:54.100* :  A orangutan shared 97% of our DNA.
*09:54.360- 09:56.240* :  They're really clever, really intelligent.
*09:56.700- 09:59.140* :  So we were really hopeful that she was learning
*09:59.140- 10:00.180* :  from what she was seeing.
*10:00.480- 10:02.580* :  They actually stripped off, didn't they,
*10:02.580- 10:04.800* :  to show her exactly what to do?
*10:04.800- 10:06.820* :  Yeah, many of them did, yeah.
*10:07.120- 10:09.460* :  Because obviously orangutans don't wear t-shirts or bras.
*10:09.820- 10:10.980* :  So if people wanted to,
*10:10.980- 10:12.580* :  they took off their tops and their bras
*10:12.820- 10:15.120* :  and sat there with Mujah showing her exactly
*10:15.120- 10:16.000* :  what she needed to do.
*10:16.200- 10:17.280* :  The women were really amazing.
*10:17.280- 10:19.980* :  And they were so invested like they would be texting
*10:19.980- 10:21.220* :  when they weren't in the zoo asking,
*10:21.220- 10:22.040* :  how was Mujah today?
*10:22.040- 10:22.740* :  Was she interested?
*10:22.740- 10:23.480* :  How did she do?
*10:23.680- 10:24.900* :  So yeah, it was women supporting women
*10:24.900- 10:26.760* :  at its best regardless of species.
*10:27.160- 10:28.880* :  You obviously watched this.
*10:28.920- 10:30.780* :  I mean, what did Mujah do?
*10:31.000- 10:32.240* :  So the first day that we went in,
*10:32.240- 10:34.700* :  my friend Nora came in with her baby LED on the first day.
*10:35.220- 10:36.760* :  And Mujah came down to the glass
*10:36.980- 10:39.340* :  and she gathered up some extra bedding and came down
*10:39.420- 10:41.120* :  and was lying with her head in her hands
*10:41.120- 10:42.920* :  watching Nora feeding Elodie.
*10:43.400- 10:45.340* :  And I knew then that she was taking it in.
*10:45.460- 10:47.280* :  Like she was really interested.
*10:47.280- 10:49.860* :  She kind of moved herself around to get the best of you.
*10:49.860- 10:50.860* :  And we were laughing.
*10:50.860- 10:52.660* :  We were like, oh my god, this is absolutely amazing.
*10:52.660- 10:54.600* :  Nora, though Nora kind of turned herself
*10:54.600- 10:55.760* :  for the best angle as well.
*10:55.760- 10:58.680* :  And she was just like as soon as the women came in,
*10:58.940- 11:00.560* :  she was like, what are you doing?
*11:00.560- 11:01.380* :  She was like, what are you doing today?
*11:01.380- 11:02.420* :  She was dying to see what they were doing.
*11:02.420- 11:02.920* :  Did she also pick up other things
*11:03.500- 11:04.060* :  the mothers were doing?
*11:04.920- 11:05.180* :  Perhaps, you know,
*11:05.500- 11:07.900* :  cuing at the babies, speaking to the babies?
*11:08.200- 11:08.780* :  Yeah, she did.
*11:09.160- 11:10.500* :  So when her own baby arrives,
*11:10.800- 11:12.260* :  she minded her baby so well.
*11:12.260- 11:13.780* :  She carried the baby like me or you
*11:13.780- 11:15.120* :  would carry a baby, you know,
*11:15.120- 11:15.840* :  up on her shoulder.
*11:16.400- 11:17.240* :  She was kissing it,
*11:17.660- 11:19.480* :  cuddling it, smiling, cleaning it.
*11:19.540- 11:21.440* :  It was absolutely unbelievable.
*11:21.980- 11:23.440* :  She really knew how to mind it.
*11:23.500- 11:25.340* :  And I think she definitely learned that from the women.
*11:25.560- 11:28.020* :  She didn't get the position perfect for breastfeeding.
*11:28.600- 11:29.800* :  But she did everything else perfect.
*11:30.400- 11:31.760* :  And what happened to the baby?
*11:31.980- 11:33.000* :  After a certain period of time,
*11:33.020- 11:35.040* :  it was deemed that the baby was going to have to be hand-reared
*11:35.040- 11:38.440* :  because his genetic profile is so precious to the breeding program.
*11:38.440- 11:40.180* :  And orangutans are critically endangered
*11:40.180- 11:40.840* :  in the wild.
*11:40.840- 11:42.840* :  The numbers are decreasing at an alarming rate.
*11:42.900- 11:45.480* :  So the baby had to be removed and is being hand-reared
*11:45.500- 11:48.480* :  at the moment in Dublin Zoo by an expert team of keepers.
*11:48.820- 11:52.420* :  And Lizzie, do you think this kind of mimicking
*11:53.220- 11:54.400* :  could be used for other species?
*11:54.900- 11:55.920* :  Yeah, 100%.
*11:56.260- 11:58.800* :  Apes like that, like the chances are that they think
*11:58.980- 12:00.740* :  along the same lines as we do.
*12:00.960- 12:02.920* :  So definitely for the great apes,
*12:02.940- 12:05.220* :  this is definitely something that could be done in the future.
*12:05.420- 12:07.360* :  The human mothers were so invested in it.
*12:07.460- 12:09.040* :  I really think that, well, they all feel
*12:09.040- 12:10.920* :  like they've made a part in a really important project.
*12:10.920- 12:13.240* :  They were all really excited to tell their own babies
*12:13.240- 12:16.320* :  when they're older about the project that they were involved in.
*12:16.380- 12:18.040* :  But I think it was also really valuable
*12:18.540- 12:19.780* :  for normalizing breastfeeding.
*12:21.440- 12:24.320* :  Anyone who's used public transport to get around London
*12:24.320- 12:27.220* :  will be familiar with this somewhat confusing underground
*12:27.400- 12:28.320* :  or tube map.
*12:28.780- 12:30.820* :  Originally designed in 1933,
*12:30.820- 12:33.100* :  it turned the tangle of train routes
*12:33.320- 12:35.100* :  into a neat diagram of colored,
*12:35.360- 12:36.380* :  criss-crossing lines.
*12:37.200- 12:39.320* :  But now a new version has gone viral,
*12:39.960- 12:41.580* :  as Owen T. J. Smith reports.
*12:49.280- 12:49.920* :  For many people,
*12:50.260- 12:52.020* :  it's not the awkward step off the train
*12:52.020- 12:53.900* :  that makes it hard to get around London.
*12:53.900- 12:56.400* :  But the awkward layout of the tube map,
*12:56.900- 12:59.460* :  the familiar linear map for the city's underground,
*12:59.500- 13:01.780* :  is based on a design by Henry Beck,
*13:01.780- 13:03.620* :  more than 90 years ago.
*13:04.120- 13:06.820* :  Its purpose is to show people where the stations are
*13:06.820- 13:08.460* :  in relation to each other,
*13:08.560- 13:11.240* :  rather than their actual geographical locations.
*13:11.780- 13:14.700* :  But this can mean stations that are within a few minutes walk
*13:14.700- 13:16.860* :  of each other seem really far apart.
*13:17.380- 13:19.140* :  I've been speaking to a psychology lecturer
*13:19.140- 13:21.080* :  at the University of Essex in England,
*13:21.200- 13:24.480* :  who also happens to be a map collector and enthusiast.
*13:24.860- 13:27.420* :  The TFL map doesn't simplify reality,
*13:27.420- 13:29.620* :  it's not particularly coherent,
*13:30.580- 13:31.820* :  it's not balanced,
*13:32.280- 13:33.760* :  and it's geographically
*13:33.760- 13:35.660* :  there's some really weird stuff happening on that.
*13:36.100- 13:36.880* :  You look at past the map,
*13:36.880- 13:37.660* :  you think, hang on a minute,
*13:38.140- 13:40.080* :  it's not just things move down a little bit
*13:40.080- 13:41.320* :  in relation to each other.
*13:41.520- 13:44.040* :  There's things which are so crazy out of place.
*13:44.660- 13:47.180* :  So Max Roberts designed his own version
*13:47.180- 13:48.500* :  of the London tube map
*13:48.800- 13:50.620* :  in a series of colour-coded circles,
*13:51.060- 13:51.840* :  rather than lines.
*13:52.480- 13:55.100* :  And within 24 hours of posting it on social media,
*13:55.640- 13:57.520* :  over a million people had seen it.
*13:57.960- 14:00.260* :  He told me he took inspiration from a map
*14:00.280- 14:02.040* :  in the back of a Paris guidebook
*14:02.060- 14:04.200* :  based on concentric ovals,
*14:04.600- 14:06.820* :  but his main motivation was to illustrate
*14:06.820- 14:09.680* :  how a map can teach us about the shape of a city,
*14:10.060- 14:11.940* :  something that can't necessarily be done
*14:12.300- 14:13.780* :  through modern GPS technology.
*14:14.120- 14:15.840* :  As soon as you start relying on the computer,
*14:16.160- 14:17.820* :  you don't learn about where everything is,
*14:17.820- 14:19.320* :  you're self anymore.
*14:19.760- 14:21.940* :  And the other problem with computer softwares is,
*14:22.520- 14:24.480* :  it's good at answering a question like,
*14:24.600- 14:26.680* :  I'm at A, and I need to get to B,
*14:27.180- 14:29.160* :  but it's terrible at answering a question like,
*14:29.300- 14:32.040* :  I'm at A, I've got an hour to spare,
*14:32.420- 14:33.920* :  and what can I do instead?
*14:33.920- 14:35.200* :  So you get the map out and you think,
*14:35.200- 14:36.320* :  oh, that's nearby,
*14:36.320- 14:38.440* :  I could pop down to Waterloo
*14:38.500- 14:39.520* :  and look at the South Bank for a bit,
*14:39.520- 14:40.720* :  or something like that.
*14:41.100- 14:41.940* :  Maps are good for that.
*14:42.600- 14:44.500* :  Transport for London say the original tube map
*14:44.500- 14:46.400* :  is an iconic piece
*14:46.560- 14:48.100* :  of world-renowned design
*14:48.220- 14:50.320* :  and that there are no plans to change it.
*14:50.600- 14:51.920* :  So, at least for now,
*14:52.240- 14:53.940* :  it seems navigating around London
*14:54.340- 14:56.160* :  won't have you going around in circles.
*14:56.920- 14:58.360* :  You may remember a few weeks ago
*14:58.360- 15:00.060* :  we told you about a seagull
*15:00.120- 15:02.240* :  that had been banned from a shop in the UK
*15:02.740- 15:04.360* :  for a 10-year crime spree,
*15:04.740- 15:06.520* :  stealing crisps or potato chips.
*15:07.200- 15:09.580* :  While Jeremy from Sydney centres this story.
*15:10.400- 15:11.420* :  In the mid-90s,
*15:11.620- 15:13.820* :  I lived and worked in remote up back Australia
*15:14.200- 15:15.620* :  in a desert highway roadhouse
*15:15.620- 15:17.560* :  at Kainuna, far west in Queensland,
*15:18.220- 15:19.800* :  population of 16 people.
*15:20.520- 15:21.480* :  We had to add weights
*15:21.840- 15:23.420* :  and a latch to the screen door
*15:23.720- 15:26.080* :  in order to stop a family of braggers
*15:26.080- 15:27.900* :  from exactly the same crime
*15:27.900- 15:29.360* :  as your intrepid seagull.
*15:29.880- 15:30.860* :  For those who don't know,
*15:31.720- 15:32.980* :  or aren't familiar with braggers,
*15:33.580- 15:35.360* :  also known as the Australian Crane,
*15:35.900- 15:37.660* :  picture of four to five foot tall,
*15:37.980- 15:39.440* :  red-faced greybird.
*15:40.080- 15:41.380* :  A mating pair had learnt
*15:41.500- 15:43.180* :  to frequently talk to their young
*15:43.500- 15:45.000* :  to use their size, weight
*15:45.640- 15:46.580* :  and very long necks
*15:47.500- 15:48.020* :  to push open the door,
*15:49.540- 15:50.800* :  reach around and grab a packet of chips
*15:52.380- 15:54.480* :  from the shelves.
*15:54.480- 15:55.060* :  Then run out past the petrol and diesel balesers
*15:55.540- 15:56.540* :  and pop open the packet
*15:57.560- 15:59.060* :  and gorge out to their hearts
*15:59.500- 16:00.320* :  and bellies content.
*16:01.700- 16:03.000* :  They definitely showed a preference
*16:03.500- 16:04.120* :  for salt and vinegar.
*16:05.500- 16:06.700* :  As terrible as it is for all birds
*16:07.500- 16:08.720* :  digestive and overall health
*16:10.400- 16:12.280* :  it really was quite a remarkably
*16:12.280- 16:14.080* :  impressive display of teamwork,
*16:14.120- 16:15.360* :  learning and intelligence.
*16:16.660- 16:18.280* :  And Roji from Sri Lanka
*16:18.280- 16:20.240* :  told us about some of the many acts
*16:20.240- 16:22.080* :  of kindness she's experienced
*16:22.080- 16:23.760* :  from strangers while travelling,
*16:24.560- 16:26.260* :  including Tabia who helped her
*16:26.260- 16:28.440* :  to get to Vienna when she missed her bus
*16:28.820- 16:30.140* :  and took her out for coffee
*16:30.140- 16:30.620* :  and cake.
*16:31.500- 16:33.320* :  And she says all the help she's received
*16:33.620- 16:35.360* :  inspired her to help a woman
*16:35.500- 16:37.640* :  who looked lost while visiting her home town
*16:37.640- 16:38.920* :  during a major cultural
*16:39.500- 16:41.020* :  and religious festival earlier this month,
*16:41.500- 16:42.600* :  taking her to a balcony
*16:45.880- 16:46.480* :  to watch the parade
*16:46.480- 16:48.140* :  and making her dinner.
*16:51.340- 16:52.420* :  Coming up in this podcast
*16:53.240- 16:54.340* :  I can't be too many day
*16:54.340- 16:54.820* :  any time.
*16:56.360- 16:58.260* :  I'm glad that we made it together.
*16:58.680- 17:00.060* :  My target is to collect good
*17:00.060- 17:01.220* :  for the country
*17:01.500- 17:03.360* :  and make the Africa proud as it.
*17:04.020- 17:06.040* :  The Nigerian couple making history
*17:06.040- 17:07.260* :  at the Paralympics.
*17:17.100- 17:17.820* :  This season

*17:33.660- 17:35.400* :  and the kid casually tells you

*17:37.500- 17:38.380* :  to do tomorrow.

*18:34.600- 18:36.320* :  and an ultra marathon swimmer
*18:36.680- 18:38.380* :  you might think Eva Buzo
*18:38.600- 18:39.860* :  had already achieved more
*18:39.860- 18:41.100* :  than enough in her life.
*18:41.600- 18:42.800* :  But she can now add
*18:43.600- 18:44.960* :  becoming the first documented person
*18:45.500- 18:47.320* :  to swim from Italy to Albania
*18:47.500- 18:49.020* :  unassisted to her resume.

*18:51.500- 18:52.780* :  grueling 92 kilometres swim
*18:53.500- 18:55.440* :  in 35 hours and 17 minutes.
*18:56.120- 18:57.020* :  But at the finish line
*18:57.500- 18:58.560* :  near the town of Florey,
*19:00.240- 19:01.340* :  she spoke because her tongue,
*19:01.500- 19:03.320* :  mouth and lips had swollen up
*19:03.500- 19:04.220* :  in the saltwater.
*19:08.480- 19:08.540* :  The happy pods,
*19:09.640- 19:09.880* :  Abiona Buia, caught up
*19:09.920- 19:11.960* :  with her a day later
*19:12.480- 19:14.000* :  to find out more about the
*19:14.000- 19:14.540* :  momentous swim.
*19:20.320- 19:21.460* :  The finish was nothing
*19:21.500- 19:23.100* :  like what I expected to be.
*19:23.500- 19:24.540* :  My swimming costume provider
*19:25.560- 19:26.180* :  gave me a pair of red
*19:28.320- 19:29.320* :  and so in my mind
*19:29.500- 19:30.380* :  it was always going to be me
*19:31.500- 19:34.500* :  in the red swimming class
*19:34.660- 19:36.240* :  walking up to the beach
*19:36.900- 19:38.500* :  that's how it would be
*19:38.640- 19:38.920* :  photographed
*19:40.640- 19:42.220* :  and that's how it would be
*19:44.380- 19:44.400* :  remembered.
*19:46.480- 19:46.560* :  But the swim finished
*19:46.560- 19:47.340* :  and the absolute dead middle
*19:49.340- 19:50.480* :  of the night.
*19:50.480- 19:51.400* :  My team was like the rock is
*19:52.320- 19:53.340* :  just there.
*19:53.500- 19:55.160* :  But I couldn't see it.
*19:55.500- 19:56.740* :  I had so much emotion
*19:57.560- 19:58.660* :  and I got on to the boat
*19:59.500- 20:02.480* :  and I hugged my team
*20:02.480- 20:03.740* :  and I just fell asleep
*20:04.760- 20:04.820* :  holding their hand.
*20:06.960- 20:08.500* :  First person to swim
*20:09.820- 20:10.520* :  from Italy 12 right now.
*20:12.100- 20:12.300* :  Absolutely the best moment
*20:13.340- 20:14.500* :  was I knew that the people
*20:14.600- 20:16.520* :  in Valora were supporting my swim
*20:16.720- 20:18.040* :  and my mouth was really swollen
*20:20.300- 20:20.480* :  after about 28 hours
*20:20.480- 20:22.120* :  and so I did an Instagram
*20:22.120- 20:23.560* :  live post and I said
*20:23.560- 20:24.300* :  to the boat
*20:27.000- 20:28.500* :  I really need some ice cream
*20:29.820- 20:30.420* :  because my mouth
*20:31.700- 20:32.200* :  is really swollen
*20:33.560- 20:34.220* :  and it's really painful
*20:35.080- 20:36.500* :  so if anyone could get here
*20:36.500- 20:37.820* :  with a delivery of ice cream
*20:37.820- 20:39.380* :  you would be saving the day
*20:40.980- 20:42.320* :  I'm sure it is 30 hours later
*20:42.560- 20:43.720* :  30 hours to the top
*20:43.720- 20:46.020* :  of ice cream show
*20:46.060- 20:47.040* :  and it means delivery
*20:48.660- 20:50.500* :  right in the middle of the
*20:50.500- 20:51.380* :  dark since it ice cream
*20:52.560- 20:53.360* :  she is
*20:56.480- 20:56.540* :  things to be
*20:57.400- 20:57.880* :  not happy with.
*20:59.100- 21:00.480* :  She's doing super well
*21:01.500- 21:01.720* :  so much to look out on.
*21:01.720- 21:04.480* :  Why did you choose to swim
*21:04.660- 21:06.500* :  this particular stretch of water
*21:08.080- 21:08.500* :  I know that you're
*21:08.500- 21:10.480* :  of Albanian origin
*21:11.100- 21:11.700* :  was that a factor
*21:11.700- 21:13.080* :  in your decision making?
*21:16.380- 21:16.400* :  Absolutely.
*21:16.840- 21:17.500* :  My grandfather was Albanian
*21:17.680- 21:19.720* :  so I really wanted to find a way
*21:19.720- 21:21.120* :  to connect with my Albanian
*21:21.500- 21:22.880* :  heritage and a way that is
*21:26.480- 21:26.540* :  speaking my language
*21:28.460- 21:28.520* :  which is swimming.
*21:30.280- 21:30.480* :  I feel like it's
*21:30.740- 21:31.440* :  understating it so it's in my blood.
*21:31.500- 21:33.880* :  I just feel more comfortable
*21:34.420- 21:36.420* :  than I do on land.
*21:36.420- 21:37.580* :  I absolutely love it.
*21:37.580- 21:38.260* :  I don't care how big the surface
*21:39.500- 21:41.800* :  I always feel safe and comfortable
*21:43.840- 21:44.500* :  it's just like I live under the sea
*21:46.180- 21:46.240* :  I probably would.
*21:47.540- 21:48.000* :  You know people
*21:48.000- 21:49.300* :  are inviting me out for meals
*21:49.660- 21:51.280* :  my hotel got up ready to a
*21:51.540- 21:52.540* :  really nice place you know
*21:54.660- 21:56.500* :  I'm just enjoying the
*21:57.360- 21:58.240* :  celebration side of it.
*21:58.740- 22:00.540* :  So you've been getting a hero as well
*22:00.540- 22:02.120* :  come then by the locals
*22:04.360- 22:04.560* :  I've just been invited out
*22:04.560- 22:06.460* :  for the best taking cocktail
*22:08.020- 22:08.580* :  in Valorra which I'm so excited for
*22:08.580- 22:10.040* :  because I've been on a very strict
*22:10.040- 22:12.140* :  diet this year.
*22:12.640- 22:13.380* :  I haven't had any alcohol since
*22:13.500- 22:15.480* :  last November so I'm just excited to have a cocktail.
*22:15.560- 22:16.520* :  Very much dominated by quite a
*22:16.520- 22:18.020* :  masculine ideology around
*22:18.500- 22:19.420* :  no pain, no gain,
*22:20.500- 22:21.900* :  then push through it and ignore pain
*22:23.080- 22:25.480* :  and all of that.
*22:27.060- 22:27.520* :  I kind of started to try to
*22:27.520- 22:29.500* :  do away with that sort of heavy
*22:29.560- 22:30.640* :  focus and heavy intensity
*22:30.640- 22:33.240* :  and try to focus a lot more on comfort
*22:33.240- 22:33.860* :  in the water which
*22:34.500- 22:36.720* :  communicating much more to my
*22:36.720- 22:39.500* :  pain about how I'm feeling
*22:39.520- 22:40.980* :  and just so that I'm getting a bit of empathy
*22:41.960- 22:42.240* :  from the boat.
*22:42.500- 22:44.480* :  And so I just said to my boat
*22:44.520- 22:46.600* :  I'm feeling scared and they were able to
*22:46.600- 22:48.060* :  just give me a bit of support.
*22:49.020- 22:50.280* :  Well, night time is here.
*22:50.500- 22:51.260* :  We're in the darkness.
*22:52.500- 22:53.540* :  Eve has just had her first feed.
*22:54.540- 22:57.480* :  She's doing so well.
*22:57.480- 22:57.900* :  She said she's really loving it.
*22:58.680- 23:01.440* :  And she's loving the moonlight.
*23:02.760- 23:03.380* :  What has the response been
*23:04.960- 23:05.400* :  from the Albanian community
*23:05.400- 23:06.880* :  not just in Albania but around the world?
*23:07.100- 23:09.520* :  The meaning that people have
*23:09.640- 23:10.740* :  attributed to it has just
*23:10.740- 23:11.840* :  become a constant solution
*23:15.480- 23:15.540* :  in this brain.
*23:15.540- 23:16.620* :  And then also for just the pride
*23:16.620- 23:19.320* :  Albania is feeling that you
*23:19.320- 23:20.960* :  know this person too, to do this
*23:21.280- 23:23.480* :  when first is of Albanian origin
*23:23.480- 23:25.380* :  and I feel very overwhelmed
*23:25.920- 23:27.260* :  that they've accepted me
*23:27.260- 23:29.200* :  and they're taking pride in what
*23:29.580- 23:31.480* :  I've always felt is my Albanian
*23:31.480- 23:31.800* :  identity.
*23:33.320- 23:35.440* :  I'm really, really proud of it.
*23:37.040- 23:37.240* :  Our next story comes from Devon
*23:37.240- 23:38.800* :  in southwestern England.
*23:39.480- 23:40.880* :  After posting an ad on a
*23:40.920- 23:43.040* :  so-called dating site for animals.
*23:43.740- 23:45.040* :  As Matthew Carter explains,
*23:45.540- 23:46.640* :  keepers at the zoo hope
*23:46.640- 23:48.440* :  love will soon be in the air.
*23:49.120- 23:50.120* :  Dating can be tricky
*23:50.500- 23:51.260* :  at the best of times.
*23:55.480- 23:55.600* :  But when there's only a few
*23:56.660- 23:56.980* :  hundred of your kind left in the world,
*23:57.200- 23:59.480* :  the pool can seem very, very small.
*23:59.480- 24:00.660* :  That was the dilemma facing
*24:01.600- 24:03.380* :  Freddo, an amoeu-leopard
*24:03.380- 24:04.740* :  at Dartmore Zoo.
*24:04.900- 24:06.840* :  So he was placed on the
*24:06.840- 24:08.220* :  edge of animals around the world.
*24:08.720- 24:09.980* :  He was soon paired up with
*24:10.580- 24:11.540* :  Lena from Colchester Zoo.
*24:12.500- 24:15.480* :  Keepers are hoping that Freddo
*24:16.100- 24:17.220* :  and Lena will be a
*24:19.320- 24:19.360* :  perfect match.
*24:19.420- 24:21.460* :  And the zoo can begin a
*24:22.400- 24:22.860* :  breeding programme.
*24:23.200- 24:25.440* :  Now for a few of the other stories
*24:25.440- 24:27.040* :  that have caught our eye this week.
*24:29.340- 24:29.500* :  A six-year-old boy who went missing
*24:31.100- 24:31.460* :  for five days in a forest
*24:32.400- 24:33.560* :  in Vietnam was found safe and well.
*24:33.880- 24:35.480* :  Dan Tien Lam, who set
*24:35.480- 24:37.500* :  a camp in the woods while fruits
*24:38.880- 24:39.000* :  and stream water.
*24:39.360- 24:41.480* :  He was found by local farmers
*24:42.300- 24:43.120* :  about six kilometres from where he
*24:45.420- 24:45.460* :  went missing.
*24:47.320- 24:47.480* :  Pictures online show people
*24:48.240- 24:49.020* :  tending to Lam and offering him cake.
*24:49.520- 24:51.160* :  Local police said it was a miracle
*24:51.860- 24:53.480* :  he was found alive and
*24:53.980- 24:55.500* :  congratulated him on returning safely
*24:57.320- 24:57.380* :  to his family.
*24:59.180- 24:59.480* :  A giant panda in Hong Kong has
*25:00.260- 25:01.100* :  become the oldest on record to
*25:03.060- 25:03.440* :  give birth for the first time.
*25:03.480- 25:04.980* :  The day before her 19th birthday
*25:05.380- 25:06.880* :  the equivalent of 57
*25:06.880- 25:07.580* :  for a human.
*25:08.500- 25:09.980* :  Officials at Ocean Park say the
*25:10.500- 25:11.480* :  cubs are a true rarity
*25:12.500- 25:13.220* :  but are still very fragile
*25:17.040- 25:17.560* :  so the public won't be able to see
*25:17.660- 25:19.340* :  them for a few months.
*25:19.680- 25:21.480* :  Ying Ying and the twins' father,
*25:22.040- 25:23.480* :  Li Li, have been together since 2007
*25:23.520- 25:25.480* :  but only mated successfully
*25:26.620- 25:27.480* :  in March this year.
*25:27.480- 25:28.640* :  A German Navy ship visiting London
*25:28.980- 25:30.380* :  has taken people by surprise
*25:30.900- 25:32.900* :  by playing the Imperial March theme
*25:33.200- 25:34.480* :  from the Star Wars trilogy.
*25:44.980- 25:46.700* :  The ship in the city for training
*25:46.700- 25:49.080* :  at a supply stop broadcast the music
*25:49.080- 25:50.680* :  otherwise known as the Darth
*25:50.700- 25:52.720* :  Vader theme as it travelled along the
*25:52.720- 25:54.300* :  Thames. A spokesperson
*25:54.500- 25:56.440* :  from the German Navy said the music
*25:56.500- 25:58.400* :  had no deeper message and the
*25:58.500- 26:00.200* :  choose the music freely.
*26:02.080- 26:02.720* :  To the upcoming
*26:02.720- 26:05.260* :  Paralympics now and the Nigerian
*26:05.260- 26:06.800* :  athletes are set to make history
*26:06.800- 26:08.800* :  as the first African couple to
*26:08.800- 26:09.920* :  compete at the Games.
*26:10.960- 26:12.740* :  Although KOD and Kristiana
*26:12.740- 26:14.640* :  Alibi will compete in different
*26:14.640- 26:16.520* :  classes in Paris, they've been
*26:16.520- 26:18.200* :  training together while facing
*26:18.500- 26:19.200* :  life's challenges.
*26:20.500- 26:21.840* :  As BBC Sport Africa's
*26:22.500- 26:23.620* :  Immanuel Akindubua
*26:24.640- 26:26.160* :  reports it's a love story which
*26:28.800- 26:29.500* :  has been happening for many years
*26:29.500- 26:29.800* :  ago.
*26:32.100- 26:33.380* :  No, no, I see you.
*26:35.320- 26:35.540* :  This is how we are my husband
*26:37.220- 26:37.280* :  practice every day.
*26:38.180- 26:39.460* :  It's my moment, she can't
*26:39.800- 26:40.980* :  see anything.
*26:43.100- 26:43.500* :  Makes the table tennis couple
*26:43.500- 26:44.520* :  hoping to be Paralympic champions.
*26:44.740- 26:45.480* :  I find joy in this sport.
*26:47.060- 26:47.620* :  It's time I'm playing.
*26:50.640- 26:51.420* :  You know I have anything to worry
*26:53.380- 26:53.400* :  about.
*26:53.400- 26:54.640* :  She has really done a lot of things
*26:54.640- 26:56.140* :  for me.
*26:58.200- 26:59.480* :  I'm Nigerian Paralympic
*26:59.480- 27:00.340* :  tennis champion.
*27:00.800- 27:02.520* :  I'm Nigerian number one in my
*27:02.520- 27:04.520* :  category. I'm also a
*27:05.320- 27:06.220* :  African number one.
*27:06.500- 27:08.620* :  Both Kristiana and Kairi
*27:08.620- 27:10.400* :  had polio as children.
*27:10.720- 27:12.360* :  I was not born like this.
*27:12.680- 27:13.800* :  Maybe the time that I'd be
*27:14.500- 27:15.140* :  five to six years.
*27:16.500- 27:17.540* :  So I discovered polio.
*27:18.500- 27:19.940* :  It's not easy to be a fiscal
*27:20.500- 27:21.260* :  challenge in this country.
*27:22.640- 27:24.980* :  So just for example, I'm coming to
*27:25.000- 27:26.600* :  training. It's difficult for me to
*27:26.600- 27:27.840* :  meet up with the transforms.
*27:29.100- 27:30.160* :  When Bostop was crowded
*27:30.680- 27:32.140* :  and to be the last person to body
*27:32.880- 27:34.860* :  boss.
*27:34.860- 27:37.480* :  My family, I don't think that they
*27:38.440- 27:39.300* :  seem like someone that
*27:41.300- 27:41.340* :  becomes something
*27:41.780- 27:43.100* :  like a minute of face stress.
*27:43.920- 27:45.420* :  A minute of face abuse outside.
*27:45.420- 27:47.500* :  But due to this sport, I'm not always

*28:15.240- 28:16.660* :  but then I was not
*28:16.660- 28:18.020* :  giving any more attention.
*28:18.560- 28:21.220* :  And I moved to Lagos to be with Kairi

*28:33.820- 28:35.040* :  and it's own family too.

*28:40.800- 28:42.500* :  because of being from different parts
*28:42.500- 28:45.100* :  of Nigeria and both been disabled
